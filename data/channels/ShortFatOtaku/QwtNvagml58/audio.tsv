0	8960	It's time to talk about Balenciaga, the high fashion company.
8960	13760	Now you know me, I don't care one iota about fashion, I still dress like a 2000s era slacker.
13760	18120	But even an outsider like me knows that all these fashionistas, both within Balenciaga
18120	19680	and elsewhere, are all artsy-fartsy.
19680	23240	That's why you get women walking down the runway dressed up like Christmas trees and
23240	24840	avocados and Cousin It.
24840	28700	So it's no surprise to anybody that when rumblings of some weird stuff coming out of
28700	32980	Balenciaga began to hit the scene, the initial reaction was to basically just hand wave it.
32980	36820	They're just auteurs guys, they're always avant garde and whatever, don't worry about
36820	37820	it.
37820	38820	And that was pretty much how I treated it.
38820	42140	Just another dumb event coming out of a community that is known for dumb events, a community
42140	44300	that I personally couldn't care less about.
44300	47420	Oh boy how wrong I was, let's take the deep dive.
47420	52820	It all began with these viral images, featuring children posting with BDSM teddy bears.
52820	57340	I don't know if they were just selling BDSM teddies, or if they were selling fetish clothes
57340	60600	for teddies, or if the fetish gear is for children, but they weren't going to model
60600	63300	it on kids in the pictures after all, so they put it on teddies instead.
63300	65260	All I know is that it looks really, really weird.
65260	69300	You've got kids hanging out with wine and drugs and equipment with sexual undertones.
69300	71300	This is all very sus.
71300	73980	Part of that same photoshoot included this picture.
73980	76820	No kids this time, but instead just a messy desk with a purse.
76820	80740	However, if you zoom in on the half-concealed papers on the desk, you'll discover something
80740	82100	quite interesting about them.
82100	86580	The paper is a printout of the Supreme Court ruling Ashcroft vs Free Speech Coalition,
86580	91940	a 2002 case which struck down parts of the 1996 Child Porn Prevention Act, criminalizing
91940	96500	virtual CP, meaning content where no real child was actually harmed, but nonetheless
96500	98460	did portray fake children being harmed.
98460	100220	We're talking about Lolly here, guys.
100220	104780	Though the suit was brought primarily by the porn industry, which, at that time, was engaged
104780	108860	in a trend of taking above-age models who looked young, putting them in high school
108860	113100	uniforms, and making porn videos that appeared to star high school girls, other interests
113100	117860	also objected, stating that, for example, because Romeo and Juliet starred a 14-year-old
117860	121820	girl in Universe in the lead role, the law was written such that it would criminalize
121820	126180	putting on that play, even if Juliet was played by a clearly adult woman.
126180	130900	And this is what that background paper was in the Blenciaga photoshoot, a copy of Ashcroft
130900	135580	vs Free Speech Coalition, where part of the US's child porn laws were struck down.
135580	136580	Why that?
136580	138420	Why did it have to be that specific paper, guys?
138420	140620	Did you just happen to have it printed out for some reason?
140620	143180	Like, oh shit, we need some papers real quick to make this photo work.
143180	144580	Here you go, I got these lying around.
144580	145900	Why did they have these?
145900	147680	Or did they purposely print these out?
147680	149020	And if so, why?
149020	150260	So this went viral.
150260	154260	And after Blenciaga realized that their entire brand was currently in the process of burning
154260	158440	to the ground, they decided to sue the guy who directed the photoshoot, Gabriel Gallimberti.
158440	160620	The claim was, Blenciaga just didn't know.
160620	164220	It was all Gallimberti's fault, and because of some mistake, the photoshoot was approved
164220	166140	without the higher-ups knowing what was going on.
166140	170340	After Blenciaga began to try and divert attention to Gallimberti, the internet quickly picked
170380	173060	up this article he had shared on social media.
173060	175980	Why restrict child porn but not guns?
175980	178940	Now, everyone thinks he wrote the article, but he did not.
178940	179940	He only shared it.
179940	182220	But the article is also a little sus.
182220	185620	The article makes the point that America has a restriction on the First Amendment when
185620	188220	it comes to child pornography, because children are harmed.
188220	191660	And by that logic, America should also have a restriction on the Second Amendment, because
191660	193400	children are also harmed.
193400	197540	And the article presents statistics, showing that more children die from gun violence than
197540	199660	on-duty cops or soldiers.
199660	203340	The argument in the article is that if we allow guns, despite this harm that comes to
203340	207020	children, in the name of rights, then we should also allow child pornography for the same
207020	208020	reason.
208020	213180	It's very much a Voshian, we-must-be-consistent-and-allow-child-porn-if-we-benefit-from-child-labor type of argument.
213180	217100	I get what he's saying, but it's probably the worst fucking possible way to say it.
217100	220700	Another Blenciaga ad featured a similarly messy desk, this time with the background
220700	223020	showing a book written by Michael Bormans.
223020	224860	Jesus, this dude has to have an ego.
224860	228620	Generally, the spine of a book has the title as its largest font, not the author.
228620	233540	Michael Bormans is a Belgian painter, photographer, and filmmaker, who is reasonably prolific.
233540	237560	But after the internet began to autistically scour every single Blenciaga photo for more
237560	242160	hidden pedo secrets, they discovered that Bormans, back in 2018, put on an art exhibition
242160	247440	in Hong Kong titled Fire from the Sun, featuring paintings of naked toddlers and young children
247440	250380	covered in blood and engaged in some very strange behavior.
250380	254960	It's not overtly sexual, but it does range between violent and revolting.
254960	259240	And then there's the case of Lotta Volkova, who at one point worked for Blenciaga as a
259240	260240	designer.
260240	263800	After her part in all of this went viral, mainstream media quickly moved to report that
263800	266120	she's not currently working for Blenciaga, guys.
266120	267120	Stop looking at everyone, please.
267120	269600	And, of course, Volkova's Instagram is now private.
269600	271220	But the internet never forgets.
271220	275000	Her account was filled with photos of children in simulated positions of distress.
275000	277480	Children with simulated abuse, at least I hope it's simulated.
277480	280960	Stuff that is, again, not overtly sexual, but is, really sus.
280960	284040	Oh yeah, she's also doing the BDSM teddy bear thing, too.
284120	287560	Volkova's boyfriend, I think, they've got some kind of relationship at least, is
287560	290480	Gosia Robcinski, who is another fashion designer.
290480	294720	This guy's got allegations from back in 2018, where text messages leaked showing him
294720	297680	asking two underage boys to send him nudes.
297680	301560	Robcinski's defense was that he was simply recruiting models for his next shoot, and
301560	303160	he needed them to send him pictures.
303160	308000	Robcinski hasn't directly worked with Blenciaga as far as I can tell, but he has collaborated
308000	311880	with a lot of notables at Blenciaga on his own projects, including Volkova.
311920	316440	Another close friend of the duo is Demna Gvasalia, who looks like a cross between Zelenski and
316440	317560	that dude from The Orville.
317560	322380	He's a lead designer at Blenciaga, and you can find his work with them on both his Instagram
322380	324400	and the company's official social media.
324400	328720	Like this video, where he designed a carrying bag that came with a fake bloody fetus in it.
328720	333320	Gvasalia outright stated in an interview that Lotta, Gosia, and I grew up on child porn
333320	336280	and radiation from Chernobyl, which is why we're all so fucked up.
336280	337880	You know, there might be something to this.
337880	340320	You nuke Japan and then you get the weirdest porn imaginable.
340760	344800	Hell, check out these two maps showing radioactive fallout from Chernobyl in Sweden and the most
344800	347200	popular porn categories in that same country.
347200	351360	The CEO of Blenciaga's parent company, Kering, sells child sex dolls.
351360	355180	I probably can't show you this image, but it's a toddler with a fleshlight for a mouth
355180	357260	and an erect cock for a nose.
357260	361640	You know, considering that Kanye's appearance on Alex Jones was one of the most batshit
361640	365880	things I have seen in a long time, the fact that he wore a Blenciaga gimp mask during
365880	370460	that appearance is probably the least crazy Blenciaga news story right now.
370460	371460	And that really says something.
371460	375080	Maybe one of the reasons Kanye doesn't see his daughter no more is because he made her
375080	377080	wear a Blenciaga gimp mask too.
377080	380200	And listen, yeah, I know I didn't complete the Kanye interview during the gangbang stream.
380200	381520	You can blame all my guests for that.
381520	382520	There were too many.
382520	383520	I'll make it up to you.
383520	385160	I'll give it another go in the next couple days, so stay tuned.
385160	387480	The reply from the left has been deafening.
387480	392240	For the amount of canceling they've done over 10-year-old, 15-year-old tweets, canceling
392240	396200	gamers, YouTubers, PewDiePie, canceling game devs like the dude behind Five Nights at Freddy's
396200	400880	for being pro-life, canceling people for making sexy drawings of adult characters, canceling
400880	405320	people for objecting to 2020's Summer of Love, nobody is coming out and talking about this
405320	406320	Blenciaga shit.
406320	408040	In fact, it's kind of the opposite.
408040	411040	Check out everybody's favorite girl bosses over at The View.
411040	415520	So there's this, there's growing anti-LGBTQ sentiment right now.
415520	420820	And how it's being framed is as portraying, you know, trans people as groomers.
420820	423540	This is a term you'll hear on the far right, they're groomers.
423540	426860	This is where you get the anti-drag queen stuff that we're seeing.
426860	431840	So Blenciaga played right into their hands by having kids in a sexualized manner, carrying
431840	433900	something that represents, you know, sex acts.
433900	439100	I think it was a really bad misstep at a moment where it's just kind of a dangerous time to
439100	441820	even give credence to those kind of insane takes.
441820	446660	How fucking culture war brainrotted do you have to be when your take is the Blenciaga
446660	450860	discourse is bad because it gives ammo to the right wing's groomer allegations.
450860	454140	They don't even care about the possibility of actual groomed kids.
454140	457280	They only care if their political opponents have a point.
457280	461040	And this is where we get to the shoe on head part of the video, where all of her Bread
461040	465220	Tube associates backstabbed her and dragged her through the mud for exactly this reason.
465220	467300	For those of you who don't know the deep lore, here's the TLDR.
467300	472520	You've got old 2014 era Skype groups, me and Sargon and Shoe and Arch and V and other
472520	476100	guys like Kraut and Mundane Matt and Harmful Opinions and Armbrick Skeptic.
476100	480220	We were the old anti-SJWs and we all kind of orbited around each other and occasionally
480220	482420	collabed and voice chatted and stuff like that.
482420	483980	Over the years the group broke apart.
483980	485660	A bunch of them went radically progressive.
485660	488560	Another group became conservatives and a few of them just went off to do their own thing.
488560	492380	As I personally understand the story, Shoe decided Bread Tube was a better place for
492380	493940	her content and her audience.
493940	498760	So these old friendships ended as a prerequisite of Vaush helping to rehab her image in the
498760	500260	eyes of the online left.
500260	503540	We all said to her in private, Shoe, your new friends are snakes.
503540	506700	They will throw you under the bus because, while you are a socialist, you're also a
506700	511440	nationalist and your, uh, unique view of politics in the 21st century will eventually lead to
511440	512820	you clashing with them.
512820	514460	She disagreed and she was wrong.
514460	517800	We predicted the backstabbing and Balenciaga was when the knives came out.
517800	522020	Shoe's got a long history of making content uncovering pedophiles in good honor.
522020	525580	She's covered pro-pedo groups and events running the entire political spectrum.
525580	530440	From the map activism and pedo as LGBT shit on the left to the child pageants in underage
530440	532640	marriages and virginity pledges on the right.
532640	536160	For her, covering the Balenciaga weirdness on her Twitter is exactly the kind of thing
536160	537240	she would do.
537240	540020	And Shoe is the reason this story blew up at all.
540020	543520	Because the New York Post took her initial digging and ran with it, dragging it into
543520	545040	the mainstream news cycle.
545040	549760	By the way, she was humorously credited as an eagle-eyed social media watchdog.
549760	554640	But alas, being aggressively anti-pedo was just too much for her Bread Tube friends.
554640	556280	I guess that is their line.
556280	559480	Okay, okay, let me try to steelman their position, as funny as it is.
559480	563800	The Balenciaga story went viral at the exact same time as the Club Q shooting, which I
563800	567360	covered over on the TUBcast, where a person shot up a gay bar in Colorado.
567360	570920	As a result of that event, the online left was in hyper-alert mode.
570920	575420	They were blaming the right's constant groomer discourse machine as radicalizing the Club
575420	576420	Q shooter.
576420	580440	And so, even if you're pointing out legitimately sus shit with children, it was considered
580440	581800	ammo for the right.
581800	585360	It did not matter to these people if actual children might be harmed.
585360	589760	Everything about it fueled the groomer discourse machine, and therefore, you're anti-LGBT.
589760	593840	In essence, Bread Tube took up the position of that woman on The View, only a lot more
593840	594840	blatantly.
594840	595840	Here's Xanderhal.
595840	600180	Shoe on Head is on her way to once again use her massive platform to provide the neo-Nazis
600180	603640	in her audience with fodder they can use to justify the murder of gay people, but this
603640	606180	time the day after another anti-gay terror attack.
606180	607900	This is pure retardation.
607900	611240	What does pedophilia have to do with anti-LGBT stuff, Xanderhal?
611240	615800	Why can't Shoe point out sus shit with kids just because Club Q also happened?
615800	618840	He did a whole video on it which is also full of retardation.
618840	623400	Demon Mama did something similar, only her video was over an hour and she is significantly
623400	627080	more insufferable, which is incredible since she's being compared to Xanderhal.
627080	630640	Demon Mama's been nipping at Shoe's heels for months now, though, long before Balenciaga.
630640	634520	The argument Shoe's making in this discussion is that ever since the yearly Pride discourse
634520	640040	became all about exposing kids to kink and drag, that the LGBT community and its activism
640040	642320	has become harder and harder to support.
642320	647240	Demon Mama's reply is simultaneously a mix of, it doesn't happen, and it does happen
647240	651080	and it's good, and what about hooters, and you need to be more responsible with your
651080	652080	platform.
652080	657040	Vadim calls Shoe talking about the Balenciaga pedo story a conspiracy on par with QAnon
657040	658040	and Pizzagate.
658040	662100	Lance is saying Shoe is causing a gay and trans panic for talking about it.
662100	665700	The only person to remain publicly silent about it is Vosch, presumably because he was
665700	668640	the reason she got back in with the online left in the first place.
668640	673040	Listen, you can feel free to disbelieve me here, but even I know people who know people,
673040	676920	and from what I hear, Vosch heavily regrets just how much he's stuck his neck out for
676920	677920	Shoe over the years.
677920	680480	I don't know why, dude, I think she's correct.
680480	685220	Being anti-pedophilia, even in the face of Club Q, should not be a hard choice to make.
685220	689720	The last time those two even spoke publicly beyond just memeing was part of that Demon
689720	695340	Mama conversation, where Vosch, with kid gloves, says that Shoe is using her platform irresponsibly
695340	697300	to talk about the weird pedo shit on the left.
697300	700940	When Shoe exasperatedly replies, I just feel like I'm going insane.
700940	702320	Hey, me too, buddy.
702320	705220	But at least it isn't because of the people and the politics that I've thrown my lot
705220	706220	in with.
706220	710140	There is a strain of leftist political thought that is expressly pro-pedophilic.
710140	713300	I will have to go into it in another video, one that is a bit more serious than this,
713300	717340	but the TLDR of it is, after World War II, one of the prevailing theories regarding why
717340	722500	voting populations sometimes vote in a fascist party that oppresses them and destroys democracy
722500	723860	is due to sexual repression.
723860	727240	I spoke about this a little in my Three Forms of Fascism video.
727240	731580	Wilhelm Reich believed that growing up in a society thick with traditional sexual morals
731580	735920	leads to sexually repressed adults, who will vote for fascist parties if given the chance,
735920	740480	and the best form of anti-fascism was normalizing a new, progressive sexual morality.
740480	744480	The Italian communist Mario Mele took this idea to its extreme, believing that adults
744480	748400	having sex with children would combat this sexual repression, leading them to grow into
748400	753540	sexually open and free adults themselves with a personality that was explicitly anti-fascist.
753540	758180	The postmodern giants Foucault and Derrida, along with many other French leftist thinkers,
758180	762460	were influenced by Reich and Mele, declaring that total political equality also required
762460	766880	equality between age groups, just as it did between races and sexes, and they famously
766880	770740	petitioned the French government to repeal age of consent laws, believing that a march
770740	775120	towards a progressive, socialist, leftist utopian vision of the future also required
775120	777820	dismantling all restrictions on human sexual activity.
777820	782120	Foucault and Derrida's specific views on the interplay between consent and socialism
782120	787000	would be repeated by Vosch in 2018, where he said that as socialism addresses power
787000	789680	imbalances, the age of consent should be lowered.
789680	794020	The point I'm getting at is, you can trace a clear line from Freudian anti-fascism to
794020	797840	modern pedophile activism that has captivated a component of the left.
797840	801800	Obviously not the whole left, there are many people on the left, like Shue for example,
801800	804400	who are horrified at what's slowly being normalized.
804400	808360	But leftist philosophy doesn't have a bulwark against this sort of subversion, and leftists
808360	812440	have to rely on fundamentally right-wing sensibilities like tradition or decency or
812440	815060	disgust responses in order to object.
815060	819400	The only leftist value that can be appealed to, to be anti-pedophilia, is harm reduction.
819400	823240	And if you can logic twist your brain into thinking that a child isn't harmed by having
823240	827620	sex with them, like all of those leftists I mentioned earlier did, then there's no leftist
827620	829020	argument against it.
829020	831500	Harm is a good argument, but it's not the only one.
831500	836120	The problem for people like Shue is, all of the other arguments exist firmly outside of
836120	837400	the leftist view of the world.
837440	841840	Anyway, after everything came out about Balenciaga, they retracted that $25 million lawsuit.
841840	845680	It became pretty clear that this isn't just some one photographer's fault, but it's something
845680	848080	deeper within their company's culture.
848080	849620	Balenciaga seems to be done.
849620	852680	It's always possible they shut up for a few months, let the storm blow over, and then
852680	854520	just come back with a rebranding.
854520	856400	That sometimes happens after a cancelling event.
856400	858660	But they could also just be permanently tanked.
858660	859660	That happens too.
859660	864240	The wider issue is, normalization is the process of making the abnormal, normal.
864240	868320	Representation is the act of making something present that is otherwise absent.
868320	872200	When these people are normalizing and representing pedophilic imagery, the question you've got
872200	873760	to ask is, why?
873760	877160	It's not so much that these specific images are extremely pedophilic or anything.
877160	880440	The child isn't naked, no one's having sex with her, and yet, it tickles something at
880440	881540	the back of your brain.
881540	885960	And the question, why is this photo being taken in this way, is that tickle?
885960	887880	That might be their artsy-fartsy intent.
887880	891720	Auteurs have been subverting expectations for decades longer than that phrase became
891720	892720	a meme.
892720	895960	And I think that's what a lot of conservatives are getting at with their objections to the
895960	899680	drag queen story hour events that are not actually sexual ones.
899680	902420	Yeah, there are some events where it's clearly sexual and that's evil.
902420	905260	There are some events where the drag queen ended up being discovered as being some kind
905260	906720	of pedo that's also really bad.
906720	909220	But I mean those events where nothing bad's actually going on.
909220	913440	The question they're asking is, why does a drag queen want an audience of children?
913440	915560	Nothing overtly bad is actually happening here.
915560	917240	Nobody's being abused or anything like that.
917240	921260	You can do this sort of thing if you want to, but the million dollar question is, why
921260	922260	do you want to?
922260	927300	Well, that's a question nobody wants to ask and nobody wants to answer.
927300	933740	Another close friend of the duo is Denma Gvasalia.
933740	940620	Another close friend of the duo is Demna Gvasalia.
940620	944480	Another close friend of the duo is Denma...
944480	947200	Another close friend of the duo is Demna...
947200	948660	Jesus Christ.
948660	952520	Another close friend of the two is Demna Gva...
952520	953800	Holy shit.
953800	962920	Another close friend of the two is Demna Gvasalia.
962920	966040	Another close friend of the duo is Demna Glasva...
966040	966840	Fuck!
