00:00.000 --> 00:08.960
It's time to talk about Balenciaga, the high fashion company.

00:08.960 --> 00:13.760
Now you know me, I don't care one iota about fashion, I still dress like a 2000s era slacker.

00:13.760 --> 00:18.120
But even an outsider like me knows that all these fashionistas, both within Balenciaga

00:18.120 --> 00:19.680
and elsewhere, are all artsy-fartsy.

00:19.680 --> 00:23.240
That's why you get women walking down the runway dressed up like Christmas trees and

00:23.240 --> 00:24.840
avocados and Cousin It.

00:24.840 --> 00:28.700
So it's no surprise to anybody that when rumblings of some weird stuff coming out of

00:28.700 --> 00:32.980
Balenciaga began to hit the scene, the initial reaction was to basically just hand wave it.

00:32.980 --> 00:36.820
They're just auteurs guys, they're always avant garde and whatever, don't worry about

00:36.820 --> 00:37.820
it.

00:37.820 --> 00:38.820
And that was pretty much how I treated it.

00:38.820 --> 00:42.140
Just another dumb event coming out of a community that is known for dumb events, a community

00:42.140 --> 00:44.300
that I personally couldn't care less about.

00:44.300 --> 00:47.420
Oh boy how wrong I was, let's take the deep dive.

00:47.420 --> 00:52.820
It all began with these viral images, featuring children posting with BDSM teddy bears.

00:52.820 --> 00:57.340
I don't know if they were just selling BDSM teddies, or if they were selling fetish clothes

00:57.340 --> 01:00.600
for teddies, or if the fetish gear is for children, but they weren't going to model

01:00.600 --> 01:03.300
it on kids in the pictures after all, so they put it on teddies instead.

01:03.300 --> 01:05.260
All I know is that it looks really, really weird.

01:05.260 --> 01:09.300
You've got kids hanging out with wine and drugs and equipment with sexual undertones.

01:09.300 --> 01:11.300
This is all very sus.

01:11.300 --> 01:13.980
Part of that same photoshoot included this picture.

01:13.980 --> 01:16.820
No kids this time, but instead just a messy desk with a purse.

01:16.820 --> 01:20.740
However, if you zoom in on the half-concealed papers on the desk, you'll discover something

01:20.740 --> 01:22.100
quite interesting about them.

01:22.100 --> 01:26.580
The paper is a printout of the Supreme Court ruling Ashcroft vs Free Speech Coalition,

01:26.580 --> 01:31.940
a 2002 case which struck down parts of the 1996 Child Porn Prevention Act, criminalizing

01:31.940 --> 01:36.500
virtual CP, meaning content where no real child was actually harmed, but nonetheless

01:36.500 --> 01:38.460
did portray fake children being harmed.

01:38.460 --> 01:40.220
We're talking about Lolly here, guys.

01:40.220 --> 01:44.780
Though the suit was brought primarily by the porn industry, which, at that time, was engaged

01:44.780 --> 01:48.860
in a trend of taking above-age models who looked young, putting them in high school

01:48.860 --> 01:53.100
uniforms, and making porn videos that appeared to star high school girls, other interests

01:53.100 --> 01:57.860
also objected, stating that, for example, because Romeo and Juliet starred a 14-year-old

01:57.860 --> 02:01.820
girl in Universe in the lead role, the law was written such that it would criminalize

02:01.820 --> 02:06.180
putting on that play, even if Juliet was played by a clearly adult woman.

02:06.180 --> 02:10.900
And this is what that background paper was in the Blenciaga photoshoot, a copy of Ashcroft

02:10.900 --> 02:15.580
vs Free Speech Coalition, where part of the US's child porn laws were struck down.

02:15.580 --> 02:16.580
Why that?

02:16.580 --> 02:18.420
Why did it have to be that specific paper, guys?

02:18.420 --> 02:20.620
Did you just happen to have it printed out for some reason?

02:20.620 --> 02:23.180
Like, oh shit, we need some papers real quick to make this photo work.

02:23.180 --> 02:24.580
Here you go, I got these lying around.

02:24.580 --> 02:25.900
Why did they have these?

02:25.900 --> 02:27.680
Or did they purposely print these out?

02:27.680 --> 02:29.020
And if so, why?

02:29.020 --> 02:30.260
So this went viral.

02:30.260 --> 02:34.260
And after Blenciaga realized that their entire brand was currently in the process of burning

02:34.260 --> 02:38.440
to the ground, they decided to sue the guy who directed the photoshoot, Gabriel Gallimberti.

02:38.440 --> 02:40.620
The claim was, Blenciaga just didn't know.

02:40.620 --> 02:44.220
It was all Gallimberti's fault, and because of some mistake, the photoshoot was approved

02:44.220 --> 02:46.140
without the higher-ups knowing what was going on.

02:46.140 --> 02:50.340
After Blenciaga began to try and divert attention to Gallimberti, the internet quickly picked

02:50.380 --> 02:53.060
up this article he had shared on social media.

02:53.060 --> 02:55.980
Why restrict child porn but not guns?

02:55.980 --> 02:58.940
Now, everyone thinks he wrote the article, but he did not.

02:58.940 --> 02:59.940
He only shared it.

02:59.940 --> 03:02.220
But the article is also a little sus.

03:02.220 --> 03:05.620
The article makes the point that America has a restriction on the First Amendment when

03:05.620 --> 03:08.220
it comes to child pornography, because children are harmed.

03:08.220 --> 03:11.660
And by that logic, America should also have a restriction on the Second Amendment, because

03:11.660 --> 03:13.400
children are also harmed.

03:13.400 --> 03:17.540
And the article presents statistics, showing that more children die from gun violence than

03:17.540 --> 03:19.660
on-duty cops or soldiers.

03:19.660 --> 03:23.340
The argument in the article is that if we allow guns, despite this harm that comes to

03:23.340 --> 03:27.020
children, in the name of rights, then we should also allow child pornography for the same

03:27.020 --> 03:28.020
reason.

03:28.020 --> 03:33.180
It's very much a Voshian, we-must-be-consistent-and-allow-child-porn-if-we-benefit-from-child-labor type of argument.

03:33.180 --> 03:37.100
I get what he's saying, but it's probably the worst fucking possible way to say it.

03:37.100 --> 03:40.700
Another Blenciaga ad featured a similarly messy desk, this time with the background

03:40.700 --> 03:43.020
showing a book written by Michael Bormans.

03:43.020 --> 03:44.860
Jesus, this dude has to have an ego.

03:44.860 --> 03:48.620
Generally, the spine of a book has the title as its largest font, not the author.

03:48.620 --> 03:53.540
Michael Bormans is a Belgian painter, photographer, and filmmaker, who is reasonably prolific.

03:53.540 --> 03:57.560
But after the internet began to autistically scour every single Blenciaga photo for more

03:57.560 --> 04:02.160
hidden pedo secrets, they discovered that Bormans, back in 2018, put on an art exhibition

04:02.160 --> 04:07.440
in Hong Kong titled Fire from the Sun, featuring paintings of naked toddlers and young children

04:07.440 --> 04:10.380
covered in blood and engaged in some very strange behavior.

04:10.380 --> 04:14.960
It's not overtly sexual, but it does range between violent and revolting.

04:14.960 --> 04:19.240
And then there's the case of Lotta Volkova, who at one point worked for Blenciaga as a

04:19.240 --> 04:20.240
designer.

04:20.240 --> 04:23.800
After her part in all of this went viral, mainstream media quickly moved to report that

04:23.800 --> 04:26.120
she's not currently working for Blenciaga, guys.

04:26.120 --> 04:27.120
Stop looking at everyone, please.

04:27.120 --> 04:29.600
And, of course, Volkova's Instagram is now private.

04:29.600 --> 04:31.220
But the internet never forgets.

04:31.220 --> 04:35.000
Her account was filled with photos of children in simulated positions of distress.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.480
Children with simulated abuse, at least I hope it's simulated.

04:37.480 --> 04:40.960
Stuff that is, again, not overtly sexual, but is, really sus.

04:40.960 --> 04:44.040
Oh yeah, she's also doing the BDSM teddy bear thing, too.

04:44.120 --> 04:47.560
Volkova's boyfriend, I think, they've got some kind of relationship at least, is

04:47.560 --> 04:50.480
Gosia Robcinski, who is another fashion designer.

04:50.480 --> 04:54.720
This guy's got allegations from back in 2018, where text messages leaked showing him

04:54.720 --> 04:57.680
asking two underage boys to send him nudes.

04:57.680 --> 05:01.560
Robcinski's defense was that he was simply recruiting models for his next shoot, and

05:01.560 --> 05:03.160
he needed them to send him pictures.

05:03.160 --> 05:08.000
Robcinski hasn't directly worked with Blenciaga as far as I can tell, but he has collaborated

05:08.000 --> 05:11.880
with a lot of notables at Blenciaga on his own projects, including Volkova.

05:11.920 --> 05:16.440
Another close friend of the duo is Demna Gvasalia, who looks like a cross between Zelenski and

05:16.440 --> 05:17.560
that dude from The Orville.

05:17.560 --> 05:22.380
He's a lead designer at Blenciaga, and you can find his work with them on both his Instagram

05:22.380 --> 05:24.400
and the company's official social media.

05:24.400 --> 05:28.720
Like this video, where he designed a carrying bag that came with a fake bloody fetus in it.

05:28.720 --> 05:33.320
Gvasalia outright stated in an interview that Lotta, Gosia, and I grew up on child porn

05:33.320 --> 05:36.280
and radiation from Chernobyl, which is why we're all so fucked up.

05:36.280 --> 05:37.880
You know, there might be something to this.

05:37.880 --> 05:40.320
You nuke Japan and then you get the weirdest porn imaginable.

05:40.760 --> 05:44.800
Hell, check out these two maps showing radioactive fallout from Chernobyl in Sweden and the most

05:44.800 --> 05:47.200
popular porn categories in that same country.

05:47.200 --> 05:51.360
The CEO of Blenciaga's parent company, Kering, sells child sex dolls.

05:51.360 --> 05:55.180
I probably can't show you this image, but it's a toddler with a fleshlight for a mouth

05:55.180 --> 05:57.260
and an erect cock for a nose.

05:57.260 --> 06:01.640
You know, considering that Kanye's appearance on Alex Jones was one of the most batshit

06:01.640 --> 06:05.880
things I have seen in a long time, the fact that he wore a Blenciaga gimp mask during

06:05.880 --> 06:10.460
that appearance is probably the least crazy Blenciaga news story right now.

06:10.460 --> 06:11.460
And that really says something.

06:11.460 --> 06:15.080
Maybe one of the reasons Kanye doesn't see his daughter no more is because he made her

06:15.080 --> 06:17.080
wear a Blenciaga gimp mask too.

06:17.080 --> 06:20.200
And listen, yeah, I know I didn't complete the Kanye interview during the gangbang stream.

06:20.200 --> 06:21.520
You can blame all my guests for that.

06:21.520 --> 06:22.520
There were too many.

06:22.520 --> 06:23.520
I'll make it up to you.

06:23.520 --> 06:25.160
I'll give it another go in the next couple days, so stay tuned.

06:25.160 --> 06:27.480
The reply from the left has been deafening.

06:27.480 --> 06:32.240
For the amount of canceling they've done over 10-year-old, 15-year-old tweets, canceling

06:32.240 --> 06:36.200
gamers, YouTubers, PewDiePie, canceling game devs like the dude behind Five Nights at Freddy's

06:36.200 --> 06:40.880
for being pro-life, canceling people for making sexy drawings of adult characters, canceling

06:40.880 --> 06:45.320
people for objecting to 2020's Summer of Love, nobody is coming out and talking about this

06:45.320 --> 06:46.320
Blenciaga shit.

06:46.320 --> 06:48.040
In fact, it's kind of the opposite.

06:48.040 --> 06:51.040
Check out everybody's favorite girl bosses over at The View.

06:51.040 --> 06:55.520
So there's this, there's growing anti-LGBTQ sentiment right now.

06:55.520 --> 07:00.820
And how it's being framed is as portraying, you know, trans people as groomers.

07:00.820 --> 07:03.540
This is a term you'll hear on the far right, they're groomers.

07:03.540 --> 07:06.860
This is where you get the anti-drag queen stuff that we're seeing.

07:06.860 --> 07:11.840
So Blenciaga played right into their hands by having kids in a sexualized manner, carrying

07:11.840 --> 07:13.900
something that represents, you know, sex acts.

07:13.900 --> 07:19.100
I think it was a really bad misstep at a moment where it's just kind of a dangerous time to

07:19.100 --> 07:21.820
even give credence to those kind of insane takes.

07:21.820 --> 07:26.660
How fucking culture war brainrotted do you have to be when your take is the Blenciaga

07:26.660 --> 07:30.860
discourse is bad because it gives ammo to the right wing's groomer allegations.

07:30.860 --> 07:34.140
They don't even care about the possibility of actual groomed kids.

07:34.140 --> 07:37.280
They only care if their political opponents have a point.

07:37.280 --> 07:41.040
And this is where we get to the shoe on head part of the video, where all of her Bread

07:41.040 --> 07:45.220
Tube associates backstabbed her and dragged her through the mud for exactly this reason.

07:45.220 --> 07:47.300
For those of you who don't know the deep lore, here's the TLDR.

07:47.300 --> 07:52.520
You've got old 2014 era Skype groups, me and Sargon and Shoe and Arch and V and other

07:52.520 --> 07:56.100
guys like Kraut and Mundane Matt and Harmful Opinions and Armbrick Skeptic.

07:56.100 --> 08:00.220
We were the old anti-SJWs and we all kind of orbited around each other and occasionally

08:00.220 --> 08:02.420
collabed and voice chatted and stuff like that.

08:02.420 --> 08:03.980
Over the years the group broke apart.

08:03.980 --> 08:05.660
A bunch of them went radically progressive.

08:05.660 --> 08:08.560
Another group became conservatives and a few of them just went off to do their own thing.

08:08.560 --> 08:12.380
As I personally understand the story, Shoe decided Bread Tube was a better place for

08:12.380 --> 08:13.940
her content and her audience.

08:13.940 --> 08:18.760
So these old friendships ended as a prerequisite of Vaush helping to rehab her image in the

08:18.760 --> 08:20.260
eyes of the online left.

08:20.260 --> 08:23.540
We all said to her in private, Shoe, your new friends are snakes.

08:23.540 --> 08:26.700
They will throw you under the bus because, while you are a socialist, you're also a

08:26.700 --> 08:31.440
nationalist and your, uh, unique view of politics in the 21st century will eventually lead to

08:31.440 --> 08:32.820
you clashing with them.

08:32.820 --> 08:34.460
She disagreed and she was wrong.

08:34.460 --> 08:37.800
We predicted the backstabbing and Balenciaga was when the knives came out.

08:37.800 --> 08:42.020
Shoe's got a long history of making content uncovering pedophiles in good honor.

08:42.020 --> 08:45.580
She's covered pro-pedo groups and events running the entire political spectrum.

08:45.580 --> 08:50.440
From the map activism and pedo as LGBT shit on the left to the child pageants in underage

08:50.440 --> 08:52.640
marriages and virginity pledges on the right.

08:52.640 --> 08:56.160
For her, covering the Balenciaga weirdness on her Twitter is exactly the kind of thing

08:56.160 --> 08:57.240
she would do.

08:57.240 --> 09:00.020
And Shoe is the reason this story blew up at all.

09:00.020 --> 09:03.520
Because the New York Post took her initial digging and ran with it, dragging it into

09:03.520 --> 09:05.040
the mainstream news cycle.

09:05.040 --> 09:09.760
By the way, she was humorously credited as an eagle-eyed social media watchdog.

09:09.760 --> 09:14.640
But alas, being aggressively anti-pedo was just too much for her Bread Tube friends.

09:14.640 --> 09:16.280
I guess that is their line.

09:16.280 --> 09:19.480
Okay, okay, let me try to steelman their position, as funny as it is.

09:19.480 --> 09:23.800
The Balenciaga story went viral at the exact same time as the Club Q shooting, which I

09:23.800 --> 09:27.360
covered over on the TUBcast, where a person shot up a gay bar in Colorado.

09:27.360 --> 09:30.920
As a result of that event, the online left was in hyper-alert mode.

09:30.920 --> 09:35.420
They were blaming the right's constant groomer discourse machine as radicalizing the Club

09:35.420 --> 09:36.420
Q shooter.

09:36.420 --> 09:40.440
And so, even if you're pointing out legitimately sus shit with children, it was considered

09:40.440 --> 09:41.800
ammo for the right.

09:41.800 --> 09:45.360
It did not matter to these people if actual children might be harmed.

09:45.360 --> 09:49.760
Everything about it fueled the groomer discourse machine, and therefore, you're anti-LGBT.

09:49.760 --> 09:53.840
In essence, Bread Tube took up the position of that woman on The View, only a lot more

09:53.840 --> 09:54.840
blatantly.

09:54.840 --> 09:55.840
Here's Xanderhal.

09:55.840 --> 10:00.180
Shoe on Head is on her way to once again use her massive platform to provide the neo-Nazis

10:00.180 --> 10:03.640
in her audience with fodder they can use to justify the murder of gay people, but this

10:03.640 --> 10:06.180
time the day after another anti-gay terror attack.

10:06.180 --> 10:07.900
This is pure retardation.

10:07.900 --> 10:11.240
What does pedophilia have to do with anti-LGBT stuff, Xanderhal?

10:11.240 --> 10:15.800
Why can't Shoe point out sus shit with kids just because Club Q also happened?

10:15.800 --> 10:18.840
He did a whole video on it which is also full of retardation.

10:18.840 --> 10:23.400
Demon Mama did something similar, only her video was over an hour and she is significantly

10:23.400 --> 10:27.080
more insufferable, which is incredible since she's being compared to Xanderhal.

10:27.080 --> 10:30.640
Demon Mama's been nipping at Shoe's heels for months now, though, long before Balenciaga.

10:30.640 --> 10:34.520
The argument Shoe's making in this discussion is that ever since the yearly Pride discourse

10:34.520 --> 10:40.040
became all about exposing kids to kink and drag, that the LGBT community and its activism

10:40.040 --> 10:42.320
has become harder and harder to support.

10:42.320 --> 10:47.240
Demon Mama's reply is simultaneously a mix of, it doesn't happen, and it does happen

10:47.240 --> 10:51.080
and it's good, and what about hooters, and you need to be more responsible with your

10:51.080 --> 10:52.080
platform.

10:52.080 --> 10:57.040
Vadim calls Shoe talking about the Balenciaga pedo story a conspiracy on par with QAnon

10:57.040 --> 10:58.040
and Pizzagate.

10:58.040 --> 11:02.100
Lance is saying Shoe is causing a gay and trans panic for talking about it.

11:02.100 --> 11:05.700
The only person to remain publicly silent about it is Vosch, presumably because he was

11:05.700 --> 11:08.640
the reason she got back in with the online left in the first place.

11:08.640 --> 11:13.040
Listen, you can feel free to disbelieve me here, but even I know people who know people,

11:13.040 --> 11:16.920
and from what I hear, Vosch heavily regrets just how much he's stuck his neck out for

11:16.920 --> 11:17.920
Shoe over the years.

11:17.920 --> 11:20.480
I don't know why, dude, I think she's correct.

11:20.480 --> 11:25.220
Being anti-pedophilia, even in the face of Club Q, should not be a hard choice to make.

11:25.220 --> 11:29.720
The last time those two even spoke publicly beyond just memeing was part of that Demon

11:29.720 --> 11:35.340
Mama conversation, where Vosch, with kid gloves, says that Shoe is using her platform irresponsibly

11:35.340 --> 11:37.300
to talk about the weird pedo shit on the left.

11:37.300 --> 11:40.940
When Shoe exasperatedly replies, I just feel like I'm going insane.

11:40.940 --> 11:42.320
Hey, me too, buddy.

11:42.320 --> 11:45.220
But at least it isn't because of the people and the politics that I've thrown my lot

11:45.220 --> 11:46.220
in with.

11:46.220 --> 11:50.140
There is a strain of leftist political thought that is expressly pro-pedophilic.

11:50.140 --> 11:53.300
I will have to go into it in another video, one that is a bit more serious than this,

11:53.300 --> 11:57.340
but the TLDR of it is, after World War II, one of the prevailing theories regarding why

11:57.340 --> 12:02.500
voting populations sometimes vote in a fascist party that oppresses them and destroys democracy

12:02.500 --> 12:03.860
is due to sexual repression.

12:03.860 --> 12:07.240
I spoke about this a little in my Three Forms of Fascism video.

12:07.240 --> 12:11.580
Wilhelm Reich believed that growing up in a society thick with traditional sexual morals

12:11.580 --> 12:15.920
leads to sexually repressed adults, who will vote for fascist parties if given the chance,

12:15.920 --> 12:20.480
and the best form of anti-fascism was normalizing a new, progressive sexual morality.

12:20.480 --> 12:24.480
The Italian communist Mario Mele took this idea to its extreme, believing that adults

12:24.480 --> 12:28.400
having sex with children would combat this sexual repression, leading them to grow into

12:28.400 --> 12:33.540
sexually open and free adults themselves with a personality that was explicitly anti-fascist.

12:33.540 --> 12:38.180
The postmodern giants Foucault and Derrida, along with many other French leftist thinkers,

12:38.180 --> 12:42.460
were influenced by Reich and Mele, declaring that total political equality also required

12:42.460 --> 12:46.880
equality between age groups, just as it did between races and sexes, and they famously

12:46.880 --> 12:50.740
petitioned the French government to repeal age of consent laws, believing that a march

12:50.740 --> 12:55.120
towards a progressive, socialist, leftist utopian vision of the future also required

12:55.120 --> 12:57.820
dismantling all restrictions on human sexual activity.

12:57.820 --> 13:02.120
Foucault and Derrida's specific views on the interplay between consent and socialism

13:02.120 --> 13:07.000
would be repeated by Vosch in 2018, where he said that as socialism addresses power

13:07.000 --> 13:09.680
imbalances, the age of consent should be lowered.

13:09.680 --> 13:14.020
The point I'm getting at is, you can trace a clear line from Freudian anti-fascism to

13:14.020 --> 13:17.840
modern pedophile activism that has captivated a component of the left.

13:17.840 --> 13:21.800
Obviously not the whole left, there are many people on the left, like Shue for example,

13:21.800 --> 13:24.400
who are horrified at what's slowly being normalized.

13:24.400 --> 13:28.360
But leftist philosophy doesn't have a bulwark against this sort of subversion, and leftists

13:28.360 --> 13:32.440
have to rely on fundamentally right-wing sensibilities like tradition or decency or

13:32.440 --> 13:35.060
disgust responses in order to object.

13:35.060 --> 13:39.400
The only leftist value that can be appealed to, to be anti-pedophilia, is harm reduction.

13:39.400 --> 13:43.240
And if you can logic twist your brain into thinking that a child isn't harmed by having

13:43.240 --> 13:47.620
sex with them, like all of those leftists I mentioned earlier did, then there's no leftist

13:47.620 --> 13:49.020
argument against it.

13:49.020 --> 13:51.500
Harm is a good argument, but it's not the only one.

13:51.500 --> 13:56.120
The problem for people like Shue is, all of the other arguments exist firmly outside of

13:56.120 --> 13:57.400
the leftist view of the world.

13:57.440 --> 14:01.840
Anyway, after everything came out about Balenciaga, they retracted that $25 million lawsuit.

14:01.840 --> 14:05.680
It became pretty clear that this isn't just some one photographer's fault, but it's something

14:05.680 --> 14:08.080
deeper within their company's culture.

14:08.080 --> 14:09.620
Balenciaga seems to be done.

14:09.620 --> 14:12.680
It's always possible they shut up for a few months, let the storm blow over, and then

14:12.680 --> 14:14.520
just come back with a rebranding.

14:14.520 --> 14:16.400
That sometimes happens after a cancelling event.

14:16.400 --> 14:18.660
But they could also just be permanently tanked.

14:18.660 --> 14:19.660
That happens too.

14:19.660 --> 14:24.240
The wider issue is, normalization is the process of making the abnormal, normal.

14:24.240 --> 14:28.320
Representation is the act of making something present that is otherwise absent.

14:28.320 --> 14:32.200
When these people are normalizing and representing pedophilic imagery, the question you've got

14:32.200 --> 14:33.760
to ask is, why?

14:33.760 --> 14:37.160
It's not so much that these specific images are extremely pedophilic or anything.

14:37.160 --> 14:40.440
The child isn't naked, no one's having sex with her, and yet, it tickles something at

14:40.440 --> 14:41.540
the back of your brain.

14:41.540 --> 14:45.960
And the question, why is this photo being taken in this way, is that tickle?

14:45.960 --> 14:47.880
That might be their artsy-fartsy intent.

14:47.880 --> 14:51.720
Auteurs have been subverting expectations for decades longer than that phrase became

14:51.720 --> 14:52.720
a meme.

14:52.720 --> 14:55.960
And I think that's what a lot of conservatives are getting at with their objections to the

14:55.960 --> 14:59.680
drag queen story hour events that are not actually sexual ones.

14:59.680 --> 15:02.420
Yeah, there are some events where it's clearly sexual and that's evil.

15:02.420 --> 15:05.260
There are some events where the drag queen ended up being discovered as being some kind

15:05.260 --> 15:06.720
of pedo that's also really bad.

15:06.720 --> 15:09.220
But I mean those events where nothing bad's actually going on.

15:09.220 --> 15:13.440
The question they're asking is, why does a drag queen want an audience of children?

15:13.440 --> 15:15.560
Nothing overtly bad is actually happening here.

15:15.560 --> 15:17.240
Nobody's being abused or anything like that.

15:17.240 --> 15:21.260
You can do this sort of thing if you want to, but the million dollar question is, why

15:21.260 --> 15:22.260
do you want to?

15:22.260 --> 15:27.300
Well, that's a question nobody wants to ask and nobody wants to answer.

15:27.300 --> 15:33.740
Another close friend of the duo is Denma Gvasalia.

15:33.740 --> 15:40.620
Another close friend of the duo is Demna Gvasalia.

15:40.620 --> 15:44.480
Another close friend of the duo is Denma...

15:44.480 --> 15:47.200
Another close friend of the duo is Demna...

15:47.200 --> 15:48.660
Jesus Christ.

15:48.660 --> 15:52.520
Another close friend of the two is Demna Gva...

15:52.520 --> 15:53.800
Holy shit.

15:53.800 --> 16:02.920
Another close friend of the two is Demna Gvasalia.

16:02.920 --> 16:06.040
Another close friend of the duo is Demna Glasva...

16:06.040 --> 16:06.840
Fuck!
