1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,960
It's time to talk about Balenciaga, the high fashion company.

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,760
Now you know me, I don't care one iota about fashion, I still dress like a 2000s era slacker.

3
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:18,120
But even an outsider like me knows that all these fashionistas, both within Balenciaga

4
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,680
and elsewhere, are all artsy-fartsy.

5
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,240
That's why you get women walking down the runway dressed up like Christmas trees and

6
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,840
avocados and Cousin It.

7
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,700
So it's no surprise to anybody that when rumblings of some weird stuff coming out of

8
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:32,980
Balenciaga began to hit the scene, the initial reaction was to basically just hand wave it.

9
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:36,820
They're just auteurs guys, they're always avant garde and whatever, don't worry about

10
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:37,820
it.

11
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:38,820
And that was pretty much how I treated it.

12
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:42,140
Just another dumb event coming out of a community that is known for dumb events, a community

13
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:44,300
that I personally couldn't care less about.

14
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:47,420
Oh boy how wrong I was, let's take the deep dive.

15
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:52,820
It all began with these viral images, featuring children posting with BDSM teddy bears.

16
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:57,340
I don't know if they were just selling BDSM teddies, or if they were selling fetish clothes

17
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:00,600
for teddies, or if the fetish gear is for children, but they weren't going to model

18
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,300
it on kids in the pictures after all, so they put it on teddies instead.

19
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,260
All I know is that it looks really, really weird.

20
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:09,300
You've got kids hanging out with wine and drugs and equipment with sexual undertones.

21
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:11,300
This is all very sus.

22
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:13,980
Part of that same photoshoot included this picture.

23
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:16,820
No kids this time, but instead just a messy desk with a purse.

24
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:20,740
However, if you zoom in on the half-concealed papers on the desk, you'll discover something

25
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:22,100
quite interesting about them.

26
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:26,580
The paper is a printout of the Supreme Court ruling Ashcroft vs Free Speech Coalition,

27
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:31,940
a 2002 case which struck down parts of the 1996 Child Porn Prevention Act, criminalizing

28
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:36,500
virtual CP, meaning content where no real child was actually harmed, but nonetheless

29
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,460
did portray fake children being harmed.

30
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,220
We're talking about Lolly here, guys.

31
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:44,780
Though the suit was brought primarily by the porn industry, which, at that time, was engaged

32
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:48,860
in a trend of taking above-age models who looked young, putting them in high school

33
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:53,100
uniforms, and making porn videos that appeared to star high school girls, other interests

34
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:57,860
also objected, stating that, for example, because Romeo and Juliet starred a 14-year-old

35
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:01,820
girl in Universe in the lead role, the law was written such that it would criminalize

36
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:06,180
putting on that play, even if Juliet was played by a clearly adult woman.

37
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:10,900
And this is what that background paper was in the Blenciaga photoshoot, a copy of Ashcroft

38
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:15,580
vs Free Speech Coalition, where part of the US's child porn laws were struck down.

39
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:16,580
Why that?

40
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:18,420
Why did it have to be that specific paper, guys?

41
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,620
Did you just happen to have it printed out for some reason?

42
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:23,180
Like, oh shit, we need some papers real quick to make this photo work.

43
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,580
Here you go, I got these lying around.

44
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:25,900
Why did they have these?

45
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,680
Or did they purposely print these out?

46
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,020
And if so, why?

47
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,260
So this went viral.

48
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:34,260
And after Blenciaga realized that their entire brand was currently in the process of burning

49
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:38,440
to the ground, they decided to sue the guy who directed the photoshoot, Gabriel Gallimberti.

50
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,620
The claim was, Blenciaga just didn't know.

51
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:44,220
It was all Gallimberti's fault, and because of some mistake, the photoshoot was approved

52
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:46,140
without the higher-ups knowing what was going on.

53
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:50,340
After Blenciaga began to try and divert attention to Gallimberti, the internet quickly picked

54
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:53,060
up this article he had shared on social media.

55
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:55,980
Why restrict child porn but not guns?

56
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:58,940
Now, everyone thinks he wrote the article, but he did not.

57
00:02:58,940 --> 00:02:59,940
He only shared it.

58
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:02,220
But the article is also a little sus.

59
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:05,620
The article makes the point that America has a restriction on the First Amendment when

60
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:08,220
it comes to child pornography, because children are harmed.

61
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:11,660
And by that logic, America should also have a restriction on the Second Amendment, because

62
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:13,400
children are also harmed.

63
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:17,540
And the article presents statistics, showing that more children die from gun violence than

64
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:19,660
on-duty cops or soldiers.

65
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:23,340
The argument in the article is that if we allow guns, despite this harm that comes to

66
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:27,020
children, in the name of rights, then we should also allow child pornography for the same

67
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,020
reason.

68
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:33,180
It's very much a Voshian, we-must-be-consistent-and-allow-child-porn-if-we-benefit-from-child-labor type of argument.

69
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:37,100
I get what he's saying, but it's probably the worst fucking possible way to say it.

70
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:40,700
Another Blenciaga ad featured a similarly messy desk, this time with the background

71
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:43,020
showing a book written by Michael Bormans.

72
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:44,860
Jesus, this dude has to have an ego.

73
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:48,620
Generally, the spine of a book has the title as its largest font, not the author.

74
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:53,540
Michael Bormans is a Belgian painter, photographer, and filmmaker, who is reasonably prolific.

75
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:57,560
But after the internet began to autistically scour every single Blenciaga photo for more

76
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:02,160
hidden pedo secrets, they discovered that Bormans, back in 2018, put on an art exhibition

77
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:07,440
in Hong Kong titled Fire from the Sun, featuring paintings of naked toddlers and young children

78
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:10,380
covered in blood and engaged in some very strange behavior.

79
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:14,960
It's not overtly sexual, but it does range between violent and revolting.

80
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:19,240
And then there's the case of Lotta Volkova, who at one point worked for Blenciaga as a

81
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,240
designer.

82
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:23,800
After her part in all of this went viral, mainstream media quickly moved to report that

83
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,120
she's not currently working for Blenciaga, guys.

84
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,120
Stop looking at everyone, please.

85
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,600
And, of course, Volkova's Instagram is now private.

86
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,220
But the internet never forgets.

87
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:35,000
Her account was filled with photos of children in simulated positions of distress.

88
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,480
Children with simulated abuse, at least I hope it's simulated.

89
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:40,960
Stuff that is, again, not overtly sexual, but is, really sus.

90
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,040
Oh yeah, she's also doing the BDSM teddy bear thing, too.

91
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:47,560
Volkova's boyfriend, I think, they've got some kind of relationship at least, is

92
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,480
Gosia Robcinski, who is another fashion designer.

93
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:54,720
This guy's got allegations from back in 2018, where text messages leaked showing him

94
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,680
asking two underage boys to send him nudes.

95
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,560
Robcinski's defense was that he was simply recruiting models for his next shoot, and

96
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,160
he needed them to send him pictures.

97
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:08,000
Robcinski hasn't directly worked with Blenciaga as far as I can tell, but he has collaborated

98
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,880
with a lot of notables at Blenciaga on his own projects, including Volkova.

99
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:16,440
Another close friend of the duo is Demna Gvasalia, who looks like a cross between Zelenski and

100
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,560
that dude from The Orville.

101
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:22,380
He's a lead designer at Blenciaga, and you can find his work with them on both his Instagram

102
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:24,400
and the company's official social media.

103
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,720
Like this video, where he designed a carrying bag that came with a fake bloody fetus in it.

104
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,320
Gvasalia outright stated in an interview that Lotta, Gosia, and I grew up on child porn

105
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:36,280
and radiation from Chernobyl, which is why we're all so fucked up.

106
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,880
You know, there might be something to this.

107
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,320
You nuke Japan and then you get the weirdest porn imaginable.

108
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:44,800
Hell, check out these two maps showing radioactive fallout from Chernobyl in Sweden and the most

109
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,200
popular porn categories in that same country.

110
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:51,360
The CEO of Blenciaga's parent company, Kering, sells child sex dolls.

111
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,180
I probably can't show you this image, but it's a toddler with a fleshlight for a mouth

112
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:57,260
and an erect cock for a nose.

113
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:01,640
You know, considering that Kanye's appearance on Alex Jones was one of the most batshit

114
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:05,880
things I have seen in a long time, the fact that he wore a Blenciaga gimp mask during

115
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:10,460
that appearance is probably the least crazy Blenciaga news story right now.

116
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:11,460
And that really says something.

117
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:15,080
Maybe one of the reasons Kanye doesn't see his daughter no more is because he made her

118
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,080
wear a Blenciaga gimp mask too.

119
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:20,200
And listen, yeah, I know I didn't complete the Kanye interview during the gangbang stream.

120
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,520
You can blame all my guests for that.

121
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,520
There were too many.

122
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,520
I'll make it up to you.

123
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,160
I'll give it another go in the next couple days, so stay tuned.

124
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,480
The reply from the left has been deafening.

125
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:32,240
For the amount of canceling they've done over 10-year-old, 15-year-old tweets, canceling

126
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,200
gamers, YouTubers, PewDiePie, canceling game devs like the dude behind Five Nights at Freddy's

127
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:40,880
for being pro-life, canceling people for making sexy drawings of adult characters, canceling

128
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:45,320
people for objecting to 2020's Summer of Love, nobody is coming out and talking about this

129
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,320
Blenciaga shit.

130
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,040
In fact, it's kind of the opposite.

131
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:51,040
Check out everybody's favorite girl bosses over at The View.

132
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:55,520
So there's this, there's growing anti-LGBTQ sentiment right now.

133
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:00,820
And how it's being framed is as portraying, you know, trans people as groomers.

134
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:03,540
This is a term you'll hear on the far right, they're groomers.

135
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:06,860
This is where you get the anti-drag queen stuff that we're seeing.

136
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:11,840
So Blenciaga played right into their hands by having kids in a sexualized manner, carrying

137
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,900
something that represents, you know, sex acts.

138
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:19,100
I think it was a really bad misstep at a moment where it's just kind of a dangerous time to

139
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:21,820
even give credence to those kind of insane takes.

140
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:26,660
How fucking culture war brainrotted do you have to be when your take is the Blenciaga

141
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:30,860
discourse is bad because it gives ammo to the right wing's groomer allegations.

142
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:34,140
They don't even care about the possibility of actual groomed kids.

143
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:37,280
They only care if their political opponents have a point.

144
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,040
And this is where we get to the shoe on head part of the video, where all of her Bread

145
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:45,220
Tube associates backstabbed her and dragged her through the mud for exactly this reason.

146
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:47,300
For those of you who don't know the deep lore, here's the TLDR.

147
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:52,520
You've got old 2014 era Skype groups, me and Sargon and Shoe and Arch and V and other

148
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:56,100
guys like Kraut and Mundane Matt and Harmful Opinions and Armbrick Skeptic.

149
00:07:56,100 --> 00:08:00,220
We were the old anti-SJWs and we all kind of orbited around each other and occasionally

150
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:02,420
collabed and voice chatted and stuff like that.

151
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:03,980
Over the years the group broke apart.

152
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,660
A bunch of them went radically progressive.

153
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:08,560
Another group became conservatives and a few of them just went off to do their own thing.

154
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,380
As I personally understand the story, Shoe decided Bread Tube was a better place for

155
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:13,940
her content and her audience.

156
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:18,760
So these old friendships ended as a prerequisite of Vaush helping to rehab her image in the

157
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,260
eyes of the online left.

158
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:23,540
We all said to her in private, Shoe, your new friends are snakes.

159
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:26,700
They will throw you under the bus because, while you are a socialist, you're also a

160
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:31,440
nationalist and your, uh, unique view of politics in the 21st century will eventually lead to

161
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,820
you clashing with them.

162
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,460
She disagreed and she was wrong.

163
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:37,800
We predicted the backstabbing and Balenciaga was when the knives came out.

164
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:42,020
Shoe's got a long history of making content uncovering pedophiles in good honor.

165
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:45,580
She's covered pro-pedo groups and events running the entire political spectrum.

166
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:50,440
From the map activism and pedo as LGBT shit on the left to the child pageants in underage

167
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,640
marriages and virginity pledges on the right.

168
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,160
For her, covering the Balenciaga weirdness on her Twitter is exactly the kind of thing

169
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,240
she would do.

170
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,020
And Shoe is the reason this story blew up at all.

171
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:03,520
Because the New York Post took her initial digging and ran with it, dragging it into

172
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,040
the mainstream news cycle.

173
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,760
By the way, she was humorously credited as an eagle-eyed social media watchdog.

174
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:14,640
But alas, being aggressively anti-pedo was just too much for her Bread Tube friends.

175
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,280
I guess that is their line.

176
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:19,480
Okay, okay, let me try to steelman their position, as funny as it is.

177
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:23,800
The Balenciaga story went viral at the exact same time as the Club Q shooting, which I

178
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:27,360
covered over on the TUBcast, where a person shot up a gay bar in Colorado.

179
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,920
As a result of that event, the online left was in hyper-alert mode.

180
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:35,420
They were blaming the right's constant groomer discourse machine as radicalizing the Club

181
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:36,420
Q shooter.

182
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:40,440
And so, even if you're pointing out legitimately sus shit with children, it was considered

183
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,800
ammo for the right.

184
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:45,360
It did not matter to these people if actual children might be harmed.

185
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,760
Everything about it fueled the groomer discourse machine, and therefore, you're anti-LGBT.

186
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:53,840
In essence, Bread Tube took up the position of that woman on The View, only a lot more

187
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,840
blatantly.

188
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,840
Here's Xanderhal.

189
00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:00,180
Shoe on Head is on her way to once again use her massive platform to provide the neo-Nazis

190
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:03,640
in her audience with fodder they can use to justify the murder of gay people, but this

191
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:06,180
time the day after another anti-gay terror attack.

192
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,900
This is pure retardation.

193
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:11,240
What does pedophilia have to do with anti-LGBT stuff, Xanderhal?

194
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:15,800
Why can't Shoe point out sus shit with kids just because Club Q also happened?

195
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,840
He did a whole video on it which is also full of retardation.

196
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:23,400
Demon Mama did something similar, only her video was over an hour and she is significantly

197
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:27,080
more insufferable, which is incredible since she's being compared to Xanderhal.

198
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:30,640
Demon Mama's been nipping at Shoe's heels for months now, though, long before Balenciaga.

199
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,520
The argument Shoe's making in this discussion is that ever since the yearly Pride discourse

200
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:40,040
became all about exposing kids to kink and drag, that the LGBT community and its activism

201
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,320
has become harder and harder to support.

202
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:47,240
Demon Mama's reply is simultaneously a mix of, it doesn't happen, and it does happen

203
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:51,080
and it's good, and what about hooters, and you need to be more responsible with your

204
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,080
platform.

205
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:57,040
Vadim calls Shoe talking about the Balenciaga pedo story a conspiracy on par with QAnon

206
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,040
and Pizzagate.

207
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:02,100
Lance is saying Shoe is causing a gay and trans panic for talking about it.

208
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:05,700
The only person to remain publicly silent about it is Vosch, presumably because he was

209
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:08,640
the reason she got back in with the online left in the first place.

210
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:13,040
Listen, you can feel free to disbelieve me here, but even I know people who know people,

211
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,920
and from what I hear, Vosch heavily regrets just how much he's stuck his neck out for

212
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:17,920
Shoe over the years.

213
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,480
I don't know why, dude, I think she's correct.

214
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:25,220
Being anti-pedophilia, even in the face of Club Q, should not be a hard choice to make.

215
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:29,720
The last time those two even spoke publicly beyond just memeing was part of that Demon

216
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:35,340
Mama conversation, where Vosch, with kid gloves, says that Shoe is using her platform irresponsibly

217
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:37,300
to talk about the weird pedo shit on the left.

218
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:40,940
When Shoe exasperatedly replies, I just feel like I'm going insane.

219
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,320
Hey, me too, buddy.

220
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,220
But at least it isn't because of the people and the politics that I've thrown my lot

221
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:46,220
in with.

222
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:50,140
There is a strain of leftist political thought that is expressly pro-pedophilic.

223
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:53,300
I will have to go into it in another video, one that is a bit more serious than this,

224
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:57,340
but the TLDR of it is, after World War II, one of the prevailing theories regarding why

225
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:02,500
voting populations sometimes vote in a fascist party that oppresses them and destroys democracy

226
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,860
is due to sexual repression.

227
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:07,240
I spoke about this a little in my Three Forms of Fascism video.

228
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:11,580
Wilhelm Reich believed that growing up in a society thick with traditional sexual morals

229
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:15,920
leads to sexually repressed adults, who will vote for fascist parties if given the chance,

230
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:20,480
and the best form of anti-fascism was normalizing a new, progressive sexual morality.

231
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,480
The Italian communist Mario Mele took this idea to its extreme, believing that adults

232
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,400
having sex with children would combat this sexual repression, leading them to grow into

233
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:33,540
sexually open and free adults themselves with a personality that was explicitly anti-fascist.

234
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:38,180
The postmodern giants Foucault and Derrida, along with many other French leftist thinkers,

235
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:42,460
were influenced by Reich and Mele, declaring that total political equality also required

236
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:46,880
equality between age groups, just as it did between races and sexes, and they famously

237
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,740
petitioned the French government to repeal age of consent laws, believing that a march

238
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:55,120
towards a progressive, socialist, leftist utopian vision of the future also required

239
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,820
dismantling all restrictions on human sexual activity.

240
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:02,120
Foucault and Derrida's specific views on the interplay between consent and socialism

241
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:07,000
would be repeated by Vosch in 2018, where he said that as socialism addresses power

242
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,680
imbalances, the age of consent should be lowered.

243
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:14,020
The point I'm getting at is, you can trace a clear line from Freudian anti-fascism to

244
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:17,840
modern pedophile activism that has captivated a component of the left.

245
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:21,800
Obviously not the whole left, there are many people on the left, like Shue for example,

246
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,400
who are horrified at what's slowly being normalized.

247
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:28,360
But leftist philosophy doesn't have a bulwark against this sort of subversion, and leftists

248
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:32,440
have to rely on fundamentally right-wing sensibilities like tradition or decency or

249
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:35,060
disgust responses in order to object.

250
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:39,400
The only leftist value that can be appealed to, to be anti-pedophilia, is harm reduction.

251
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:43,240
And if you can logic twist your brain into thinking that a child isn't harmed by having

252
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:47,620
sex with them, like all of those leftists I mentioned earlier did, then there's no leftist

253
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:49,020
argument against it.

254
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:51,500
Harm is a good argument, but it's not the only one.

255
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:56,120
The problem for people like Shue is, all of the other arguments exist firmly outside of

256
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,400
the leftist view of the world.

257
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,840
Anyway, after everything came out about Balenciaga, they retracted that $25 million lawsuit.

258
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:05,680
It became pretty clear that this isn't just some one photographer's fault, but it's something

259
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,080
deeper within their company's culture.

260
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,620
Balenciaga seems to be done.

261
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:12,680
It's always possible they shut up for a few months, let the storm blow over, and then

262
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,520
just come back with a rebranding.

263
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,400
That sometimes happens after a cancelling event.

264
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,660
But they could also just be permanently tanked.

265
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:19,660
That happens too.

266
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:24,240
The wider issue is, normalization is the process of making the abnormal, normal.

267
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:28,320
Representation is the act of making something present that is otherwise absent.

268
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,200
When these people are normalizing and representing pedophilic imagery, the question you've got

269
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,760
to ask is, why?

270
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,160
It's not so much that these specific images are extremely pedophilic or anything.

271
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:40,440
The child isn't naked, no one's having sex with her, and yet, it tickles something at

272
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,540
the back of your brain.

273
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:45,960
And the question, why is this photo being taken in this way, is that tickle?

274
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,880
That might be their artsy-fartsy intent.

275
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:51,720
Auteurs have been subverting expectations for decades longer than that phrase became

276
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,720
a meme.

277
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,960
And I think that's what a lot of conservatives are getting at with their objections to the

278
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:59,680
drag queen story hour events that are not actually sexual ones.

279
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,420
Yeah, there are some events where it's clearly sexual and that's evil.

280
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:05,260
There are some events where the drag queen ended up being discovered as being some kind

281
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:06,720
of pedo that's also really bad.

282
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,220
But I mean those events where nothing bad's actually going on.

283
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:13,440
The question they're asking is, why does a drag queen want an audience of children?

284
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,560
Nothing overtly bad is actually happening here.

285
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,240
Nobody's being abused or anything like that.

286
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:21,260
You can do this sort of thing if you want to, but the million dollar question is, why

287
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:22,260
do you want to?

288
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:27,300
Well, that's a question nobody wants to ask and nobody wants to answer.

289
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:33,740
Another close friend of the duo is Denma Gvasalia.

290
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:40,620
Another close friend of the duo is Demna Gvasalia.

291
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:44,480
Another close friend of the duo is Denma...

292
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,200
Another close friend of the duo is Demna...

293
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,660
Jesus Christ.

294
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:52,520
Another close friend of the two is Demna Gva...

295
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,800
Holy shit.

296
00:15:53,800 --> 00:16:02,920
Another close friend of the two is Demna Gvasalia.

297
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:06,040
Another close friend of the duo is Demna Glasva...

298
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:06,840
Fuck!
