0	2400	I'm noticing a trend with my channel.
2400	5140	A lot of my videos eventually come around to the sentence,
5140	8200	I remember when I was in high school and the left...
8200	11700	To anyone watching this that is in their teens or early 20s right now,
11700	16540	it must be hard to imagine a time when the left wing of politics was the same rational side,
16540	19300	caring about stuff like individual liberties and free speech,
19300	21900	while the right wing was full of evangelical Christians
21900	25700	who wanted to take away video games, rock and roll, D&D, and South Park.
25700	30300	I remember when I was in high school and the left fought for the legalization of gay marriage,
30300	34500	and the left fought for freedom of speech in academia against the religious orthodoxy,
34500	37000	and the left fought for legalized marijuana,
37000	41900	and the left fought racism by demanding equal opportunities rather than reparations.
41900	43800	Am I really that old?
43800	47000	Climate change is another one of those I remember when the lefts.
47000	51600	I remember when the right's position on climate change was akin to the ostrich with his head in the sand.
51600	53800	We don't got to think about how much energy we're using
53800	56400	or how much waste we produce because that's all hippie nonsense.
56400	60500	Meanwhile, the left's position on climate change wasn't that the science is settled,
60500	63300	and if you disagree, you're a denialist like it is now.
63300	66000	Back then, the science was still relatively new,
66000	70100	and the left had to fight the right to get further studies going because,
70100	74800	let's be frank, the right wing of the 80s and 90s was entirely bought by big oil.
74800	80100	In my opinion, the scientific side of climate change seems to be a mostly settled topic.
80100	82000	Is the climate changing? Yes.
82000	83700	Do humans have something to do with it?
83700	86600	Probably. There's no way seven and a half billion of us
86600	90700	pumping carbon into the air at the rate we all do is having zero effect.
90700	95600	But for some reason, this is where that exceptionally radicalized wing of the left
95600	99000	that I like to call the eco-fascists stop their line of questioning.
99000	103000	There's a list of requirements that have to be met before you can reasonably advocate
103000	105300	for radical action regarding climate change.
105300	107300	It has to be real. I grant you that.
107300	110500	It has to be in some significant way caused by humans.
110500	111800	I grant you that too.
111800	114000	But there's more to the story than just those two points.
114000	117600	It also has to be universally negative, and I don't grant you that.
117600	120200	If you were to heat up Earth's atmosphere by a few degrees,
120200	122400	it would be harder to live near the equator for sure.
122400	127300	But suddenly, large swaths of usable land in places like Northern Canada and Russia
127300	128400	open up for farming.
128400	131100	The usable tree line for lumber moves north.
131100	134200	Access to northern resources like ore, gems, and oil,
134200	137300	all things Canada has in abundance up in the northern territories,
137300	138700	become easier to access.
138700	141700	And a usable northwest passage opens up in the ice,
141700	145400	allowing trading ships to sail through Canadian waters rather than the Panama Canal,
145400	150800	which is a massive shift in global trade, potentially in Canada's favor if monetized properly.
150800	153100	Yeah, you can tell I'm Canadian, right?
153100	157000	Heating the planet up just a little bit actually brings us prosperity, not ruin.
157000	158600	But there's also a fourth criteria.
158600	160800	Climate change has to be reversible.
160800	162500	It has to be something we can actually help.
162500	165900	If it's not, then all of this hysteria going on about it doesn't matter, right?
165900	169500	If it really does turn out to be an accept the things you can't change scenario,
169500	173100	then it makes everyone screeching bloody murder on the topic look like children.
173100	176400	However, if you ask any of these questions or bring up any of these points,
176400	179800	you are, as I said earlier, a climate change denialist.
179800	181900	You're peddling in conspiracy theories,
181900	187000	which is some wild arrogance in itself to simply label people who disagree with you as conspiracy theorists.
187000	188800	Have we become this arrogant?
188800	192900	Do we think we know so much now that anyone who puts forward a scientific hypothesis
192900	197600	that is a bit unorthodox is automatically lumped in with people who believe we didn't actually land on the moon?
197600	199700	What happened to legitimate inquiry?
199700	201200	Isn't that the point of science?
201200	204300	When religious people say that science is a religion itself,
204300	206700	I think this is specifically what they're referring to.
206700	210000	Those who claim to have science on their side as if it were a god,
210000	213300	and then label good faith skepticism as doubt or sin.
213300	217000	Hell, NBC's even set up a website called Climate Confessions,
217000	221600	where you can anonymously confess to your climate transgressions like an eco-catholic.
221600	222800	Weird, man.
222800	226600	But there's also the political side of the climate change topic, and let's be honest,
226600	230000	these two things are constantly conflated by the eco-fascists.
230000	234600	When a climate change activist puts forward a retarded policy in the name of helping the environment,
234600	237500	any objection is labeled as climate change denialism,
237500	242000	even though the policy is from the political side and the act of denying climate change is from the scientific side.
242000	244600	The eco-fascists know this and they're counting on it.
244600	249800	After all, having science on their side is just another variant of being on the right side of history.
249800	253300	We've all seen that rant from Greta Thunberg by now, right?
279800	291000	Yeah, there it is. Fiery, passionate, and very obviously scripted.
291000	294200	Greta has actors for parents and a director for her grandpa.
294200	296200	There's no way this is her convictions.
296200	298200	In fact, here's her conviction.
309800	319800	I want to ask you, do you think it's about time that President Trump would respond to what you have said today?
329800	333800	I think… I'm sorry, what was the first question?
333800	338800	What's the message you would like to send to our leaders by doing what you are doing?
338800	345800	I think what we want to send is… the message we want to send is to say that we have had enough,
345800	350800	and anyone else want to ask another question?
350800	354800	When asked for her actual off-script opinion, she's got nothing to say.
354800	359800	She's like the student who hasn't completed her homework and is bullshitting to the teacher, because that's what she is. A kid.
359800	362800	And yes, the memes surrounding her have gone wild recently,
362800	367800	but she's being pushed forward by the adults in her life to be both a figurehead and also a target,
367800	371800	so that the actual activists and agitators don't get in trouble when they push their agenda.
371800	373800	This is a tactic as old as time.
373800	377800	The religious right would unironically say stuff like, think of the children, and this is the same thing.
377800	382800	Think of Greta. Think of David Hogg and the other kids affected by school shootings.
382800	386800	Think of whatever young face we can plaster all over the media for the next news cycle,
386800	389800	whenever an event happens and we want to twist it to further our agenda.
389800	393800	And when those fifteen minutes of fame have passed and the story has moved on, what happens to Greta?
393800	396800	Most likely, she falls into a deep depression because she no longer has the pull she used to.
396800	398800	She feels like she's peaked at sixteen.
398800	400800	Maybe she feels used.
400800	402800	Maybe she continues a career in activism.
402800	405800	Or maybe she just grows out of it, like a lot of other child activists do.
405800	410800	But if she actually holds a deep-seated fear about the state of the planet she'll be inheriting,
410800	412800	she's going to need a lot of therapy to be a functioning adult.
412800	414800	Let me put it in simpler terms.
414800	419800	Installing a fatalistic attitude into your kids so that they can maybe become a short-lived star like Greta Thunberg,
419800	422800	and then leaving them to spend the next decade of their lives in therapy
422800	427800	because they genuinely believe they will see fallout within their lifetime, is child abuse.
427800	429800	We don't let kids vote for a reason.
429800	431800	They have no grasp of politics or policy.
431800	435800	The whole out of the mouths of babes thing very rarely applies.
435800	438800	Most of the time, it's kids playing at something they don't understand.
438800	440800	And that's not a slam against them. How could they understand it?
440800	444800	I was playing Mario Sunshine blissfully unaware when I was Greta's age.
444800	447800	Okay, I'm still playing it now in Game Boomers, but you get my point.
447800	448800	Here's another example.
448800	453800	I like Soph as a YouTuber, but I also recognize that she's a child who co-writes her videos with her older brother.
453800	457800	She's edgy, she's funny, and she's often wrong.
457800	462800	Soph on Alex Jones was only different from Greta on the international news by virtue of scope.
462800	465800	I don't want anyone holding up a kid as the next messiah.
465800	467800	And yet, here we are.
467800	469800	Greta's nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize,
469800	473800	an award made useless back when Obama won it for simply getting elected while black.
473800	477800	People are getting punished on social media for speaking out against Greta's ideas.
477800	481800	Or even saying objectively true things like she's been scared into extremism.
481800	486800	Were the radical left considered Soph to be brainwashed, Greta can do no wrong.
486800	489800	And the only thing that's going to come of this, when the whirlwind passes,
489800	493800	is a broken young adult who will still think the world is collapsing around her.
493800	496800	Who will think that she failed in her duty as a savior of humanity,
496800	500800	and will be suffering from crippling anxiety and depression because the limelight is gone
500800	502800	and the establishment has abandoned her to rot.
502800	506800	Either that, or she'll wholeheartedly embrace the activist role, David Hogg style,
506800	509800	make a career out of it, and become insufferable in the process.
509800	511800	Let me share with you a bit of Canadian history.
511800	515800	This is David Suzuki, one of Canada's most well-known intellectuals,
515800	518800	and a die-hard climate activist for like 30 years now.
518800	525800	His daughter, Severn Suzuki, spoke at the UN back in I think in 1992 on the subject of climate change.
525800	530800	Hello, I'm Severn Suzuki speaking for ECHO, the Environmental Children's Organization.
530800	534800	We're a group of 12 and 13 year olds trying to make a difference.
534800	539800	Vanessa Suttie, Morgan Geiszler, Michelle Quigg, and me.
539800	548800	We've raised all the money to come here ourselves, to come 5,000 miles to tell you adults you must change your ways.
548800	555800	Coming up here today, I have no hidden agenda. I am fighting for my future.
555800	562800	Losing my future is not like losing an election or a few points on the stock market.
563800	567800	I am here to speak for all generations to come.
567800	570800	So how much of that speech was her, and how much of it was David?
570800	572800	Care to hazard a guess?
572800	575800	And how much of it sounded like Greta's speech too?
575800	577800	It's the exact same playbook.
577800	581800	Parents who have their hands up their kids' asses, puppeting them to publicly push their politics,
581800	585800	and the media eats up the image of the brave youth speaking truth to power.
585800	587800	Severn Suzuki is now 39 years old.
587800	591800	She's made a career out of climate activism, following in her father's footsteps.
591800	595800	She has two children, who will probably one day be pushed into climate activism as well.
595800	601800	And although her career has taken her all over the world, she's never lived outside of the hyper-lefty privileged bubbles
601800	604800	of either the British Columbia coast or the campus of Yale.
604800	606800	Severn has this to say about Greta.
606800	609800	She's calling for revolution, so of course she's getting pushback.
609800	611800	They're trying to silence her by discrediting her.
611800	613800	And that it's all because she's powerful.
613800	615800	This is weird, man.
615800	618800	It really feels like child grooming in a strange way.
618800	622800	Here's a woman who was shoved into the spotlight as a little girl by her high-profile father.
622800	627800	And now, as an adult, she's praising and encouraging doing what was done to her to the next generation.
627800	629800	I don't know how I feel about this.
629800	633800	I'm not saying there isn't a real scientific discussion to be had about climate change.
633800	636800	But that's the science side of the issue, not the politics side.
636800	641800	And they are two different things, no matter how hard the eco-fascists try to muddy the water on this.
641800	647800	On the political side, it is damaging and irresponsible to tell kids that the world will be barren of all life in the next decade.
647800	651800	We're saying that shit in the 80s, the 90s, and the 2000s, and yet we're still here.
651800	654800	Are there problems? Yes. Can we do something about them? Probably.
654800	658800	But this fear-mongering nonsense about the Earth turning into a wasteland has to stop.
658800	665800	Not only are generations losing out on a childhood due to this hysteria, but people are actually killing themselves over it.
665800	670800	People are losing their sex drive over it. People are vowing not to have children over it.
670800	674800	There's a wild theory out there that the reason YouTube is promoting how to live out of your van,
674800	680800	or how to squat in a shantytown content, and why the media is writing articles talking about eating bugs and eating human flesh,
680800	684800	is because they are preparing us for the climate catastrophe.
684800	686800	This nonsense has to stop.
686800	690800	Greta or any of the other kids here aren't the problem, they're the victims.
690800	698800	The worst part about the whole thing is that the eco-fascists blatantly admit that they're co-opting the scientific side of the discussion to serve as the political side.
698800	701800	To them, it's not even about saving the planet at all, it's about pushing their politics.
701800	703800	And all of these kids are just collateral damage.
703800	705800	Climate change is not just about climate change.
705800	714800	Climate change is about making sure that all people have equal opportunities and access to basic needs and to be able to thrive.
714800	721800	Climate change is a problem about equity, it's a problem about race, it's a problem about how we relate to one another.
721800	731800	And so I think this climate crisis actually might provide us with an opportunity in a weird way to make the world the way that we want it to be,
731800	733800	not just avoid catastrophe.
733800	735800	There it is, right out of our own mouth.
735800	738800	It's not about the climate, it's about the great communist struggle.
738800	741800	But if you oppose it, then you're opposing science. What horseshit.
741800	744800	The world's not going to be done in a decade.
744800	747800	No, AOC, this is not our World War II.
747800	751800	And no, nobody believes you when you backtrack by saying it was a joke.
751800	754800	You're an eco-fascist, and this was your power play.
754800	756800	That's all the Green Deal was.
756800	758800	Let's talk about the elephant in the room.
758800	764800	Bindi Irwin, the daughter of Steve Irwin, the Crocodile Hunter, in 2009 was a climate activist.
764800	767800	At 14 years old, are you seeing a pattern yet?
767800	773800	Hillary Clinton was doing a youth activism climate e-journal thing at that time, as Secretary of State.
773800	777800	And her office was accepting essay submissions from young people regarding climate activism.
777800	783800	Bindi's essay won a spot in the journal, but Hillary's office, presumably not Hillary herself because let's be real,
783800	787800	heavily edited what they considered to be offensive content out of Bindi's essay.
787800	793800	The central thesis of Bindi's essay was that an ever-growing human population was the primary cause of climate change.
793800	797800	Not fossil fuel consumption, not garbage production, not anything else.
797800	800800	But printing this would have been political suicide for Hillary.
800800	802800	But is Bindi wrong?
802800	808800	If there were only 100 humans on Earth and they were all driving cars around and burning coal in the most dirty way possible,
808800	812800	and doing whatever else they could to fuck with the planet, they wouldn't cause climate change.
812800	817800	We output more carbon into the atmosphere today than we did at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution,
817800	822800	even though technology is significantly more clean because there's just that many more of us on the planet.
822800	831800	The real inconvenient truth is that if what the eco-fascists say are true, there's just too many of us and nothing we do will help the climate.
831800	835800	Modern agriculture relies on these forms of energy, at least for the moment.
835800	840800	So if you actually want to return to a pre-carbon society, you're going to lose most of the world's food,
840800	843800	and soon after, most of the world's people, and that's just how it is.
843800	848800	However, bringing this up as a politician, like Hillary with the Bindi e-journal thing, is political suicide,
848800	850800	because it makes you sound like you're a raving mass murderer.
850800	855800	To solve climate change, we need to kill 90% of the human population is both a horrifying statement
855800	861800	and also the only way we know how to actually solve the problem if it's truly as bad as the eco-fascists claim.
861800	865800	Or you could always go the movie-bob eugenicist route and sterilize 90% of the human population.
865800	867800	Same thing will end up happening in 100 years.
867800	871800	My point is, the eco-fascists know all of this, and they don't say it,
871800	873800	because they don't actually believe in what they're saying.
873800	876800	Like AOC from earlier, backing down from the World War II comments,
876800	881800	if it truly was on the scale of World War II, if you actually believed that,
881800	885800	your solution wouldn't be, give me power and let me implement socialism.
885800	888800	The truth is, it's only ever been about implementing socialism.
888800	890800	It's never been about the environment.
890800	895800	By the way, I'm not advocating for killing or sterilizing everybody, obviously.
895800	898800	My point is, for how bad the eco-fascists say the situation is,
898800	903800	all of their proposed solutions, that you're bigoted and uneducated for not agreeing with, by the way,
903800	905800	have turned out to be limp-dicked power plays.
905800	910800	In my opinion, the actual solution is to use the vast energy that fossil fuel provides
910800	915800	to invent technologies that will allow us to power our society on cleaner future tech,
915800	918800	like hyper-efficient nuclear or whatever,
918800	921800	and then if we need to do some cleanup after it once we've got there, then we do it.
921800	923800	And by the way, that's actually what we're doing.
923800	927800	The majority of carbon's coming from India and China in the Middle East, not North America or Europe.
927800	934800	Oh, but to those countries that are still getting through the modernizing-towards-green-tech phase of Sid Meier's civilization,
934800	936800	Greta says drop dead.
936800	940800	I guess this is what you meant by the climate can't wait and the youth can't wait, eh?
940800	943800	I'll give you one final parting bit of hypocrisy on my way out.
943800	946800	In my opinion, the carbon being put into our air is a minor problem.
946800	951800	The serious environmental issue is the destruction of the oceans by ships dumping garbage out at sea.
951800	955800	The ocean is the planet's lungs, not the forests, Macron, you idiot,
955800	958800	and the widespread death of plankton is actually a serious problem
958800	961800	that needs solving within our lifetimes or you might actually be fucked.
961800	964800	At the same time, the destruction of the coral reefs is a major loss,
964800	966800	as those will take thousands of years to regrow.
