1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,400
I'm noticing a trend with my channel.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:05,140
A lot of my videos eventually come around to the sentence,

3
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:08,200
I remember when I was in high school and the left...

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,700
To anyone watching this that is in their teens or early 20s right now,

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:16,540
it must be hard to imagine a time when the left wing of politics was the same rational side,

6
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:19,300
caring about stuff like individual liberties and free speech,

7
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,900
while the right wing was full of evangelical Christians

8
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,700
who wanted to take away video games, rock and roll, D&D, and South Park.

9
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:30,300
I remember when I was in high school and the left fought for the legalization of gay marriage,

10
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,500
and the left fought for freedom of speech in academia against the religious orthodoxy,

11
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,000
and the left fought for legalized marijuana,

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,900
and the left fought racism by demanding equal opportunities rather than reparations.

13
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,800
Am I really that old?

14
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,000
Climate change is another one of those I remember when the lefts.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,600
I remember when the right's position on climate change was akin to the ostrich with his head in the sand.

16
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,800
We don't got to think about how much energy we're using

17
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,400
or how much waste we produce because that's all hippie nonsense.

18
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:00,500
Meanwhile, the left's position on climate change wasn't that the science is settled,

19
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:03,300
and if you disagree, you're a denialist like it is now.

20
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,000
Back then, the science was still relatively new,

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,100
and the left had to fight the right to get further studies going because,

22
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:14,800
let's be frank, the right wing of the 80s and 90s was entirely bought by big oil.

23
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:20,100
In my opinion, the scientific side of climate change seems to be a mostly settled topic.

24
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,000
Is the climate changing? Yes.

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,700
Do humans have something to do with it?

26
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,600
Probably. There's no way seven and a half billion of us

27
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:30,700
pumping carbon into the air at the rate we all do is having zero effect.

28
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:35,600
But for some reason, this is where that exceptionally radicalized wing of the left

29
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,000
that I like to call the eco-fascists stop their line of questioning.

30
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
There's a list of requirements that have to be met before you can reasonably advocate

31
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,300
for radical action regarding climate change.

32
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:47,300
It has to be real. I grant you that.

33
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:50,500
It has to be in some significant way caused by humans.

34
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,800
I grant you that too.

35
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,000
But there's more to the story than just those two points.

36
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,600
It also has to be universally negative, and I don't grant you that.

37
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,200
If you were to heat up Earth's atmosphere by a few degrees,

38
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,400
it would be harder to live near the equator for sure.

39
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:07,300
But suddenly, large swaths of usable land in places like Northern Canada and Russia

40
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,400
open up for farming.

41
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,100
The usable tree line for lumber moves north.

42
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:14,200
Access to northern resources like ore, gems, and oil,

43
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,300
all things Canada has in abundance up in the northern territories,

44
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,700
become easier to access.

45
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:21,700
And a usable northwest passage opens up in the ice,

46
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:25,400
allowing trading ships to sail through Canadian waters rather than the Panama Canal,

47
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:30,800
which is a massive shift in global trade, potentially in Canada's favor if monetized properly.

48
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,100
Yeah, you can tell I'm Canadian, right?

49
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:37,000
Heating the planet up just a little bit actually brings us prosperity, not ruin.

50
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,600
But there's also a fourth criteria.

51
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,800
Climate change has to be reversible.

52
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,500
It has to be something we can actually help.

53
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,900
If it's not, then all of this hysteria going on about it doesn't matter, right?

54
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:49,500
If it really does turn out to be an accept the things you can't change scenario,

55
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,100
then it makes everyone screeching bloody murder on the topic look like children.

56
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:56,400
However, if you ask any of these questions or bring up any of these points,

57
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,800
you are, as I said earlier, a climate change denialist.

58
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,900
You're peddling in conspiracy theories,

59
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:07,000
which is some wild arrogance in itself to simply label people who disagree with you as conspiracy theorists.

60
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,800
Have we become this arrogant?

61
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,900
Do we think we know so much now that anyone who puts forward a scientific hypothesis

62
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:17,600
that is a bit unorthodox is automatically lumped in with people who believe we didn't actually land on the moon?

63
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,700
What happened to legitimate inquiry?

64
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,200
Isn't that the point of science?

65
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,300
When religious people say that science is a religion itself,

66
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,700
I think this is specifically what they're referring to.

67
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:30,000
Those who claim to have science on their side as if it were a god,

68
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,300
and then label good faith skepticism as doubt or sin.

69
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:37,000
Hell, NBC's even set up a website called Climate Confessions,

70
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,600
where you can anonymously confess to your climate transgressions like an eco-catholic.

71
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,800
Weird, man.

72
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:46,600
But there's also the political side of the climate change topic, and let's be honest,

73
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:50,000
these two things are constantly conflated by the eco-fascists.

74
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,600
When a climate change activist puts forward a retarded policy in the name of helping the environment,

75
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,500
any objection is labeled as climate change denialism,

76
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:02,000
even though the policy is from the political side and the act of denying climate change is from the scientific side.

77
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,600
The eco-fascists know this and they're counting on it.

78
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:09,800
After all, having science on their side is just another variant of being on the right side of history.

79
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:13,300
We've all seen that rant from Greta Thunberg by now, right?

80
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:51,000
Yeah, there it is. Fiery, passionate, and very obviously scripted.

81
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,200
Greta has actors for parents and a director for her grandpa.

82
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,200
There's no way this is her convictions.

83
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,200
In fact, here's her conviction.

84
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:19,800
I want to ask you, do you think it's about time that President Trump would respond to what you have said today?

85
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,800
I think… I'm sorry, what was the first question?

86
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:38,800
What's the message you would like to send to our leaders by doing what you are doing?

87
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:45,800
I think what we want to send is… the message we want to send is to say that we have had enough,

88
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:50,800
and anyone else want to ask another question?

89
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,800
When asked for her actual off-script opinion, she's got nothing to say.

90
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,800
She's like the student who hasn't completed her homework and is bullshitting to the teacher, because that's what she is. A kid.

91
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,800
And yes, the memes surrounding her have gone wild recently,

92
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,800
but she's being pushed forward by the adults in her life to be both a figurehead and also a target,

93
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,800
so that the actual activists and agitators don't get in trouble when they push their agenda.

94
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,800
This is a tactic as old as time.

95
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,800
The religious right would unironically say stuff like, think of the children, and this is the same thing.

96
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:22,800
Think of Greta. Think of David Hogg and the other kids affected by school shootings.

97
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,800
Think of whatever young face we can plaster all over the media for the next news cycle,

98
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,800
whenever an event happens and we want to twist it to further our agenda.

99
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:33,800
And when those fifteen minutes of fame have passed and the story has moved on, what happens to Greta?

100
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,800
Most likely, she falls into a deep depression because she no longer has the pull she used to.

101
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,800
She feels like she's peaked at sixteen.

102
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,800
Maybe she feels used.

103
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,800
Maybe she continues a career in activism.

104
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,800
Or maybe she just grows out of it, like a lot of other child activists do.

105
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:50,800
But if she actually holds a deep-seated fear about the state of the planet she'll be inheriting,

106
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,800
she's going to need a lot of therapy to be a functioning adult.

107
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,800
Let me put it in simpler terms.

108
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,800
Installing a fatalistic attitude into your kids so that they can maybe become a short-lived star like Greta Thunberg,

109
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,800
and then leaving them to spend the next decade of their lives in therapy

110
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,800
because they genuinely believe they will see fallout within their lifetime, is child abuse.

111
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,800
We don't let kids vote for a reason.

112
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,800
They have no grasp of politics or policy.

113
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:15,800
The whole out of the mouths of babes thing very rarely applies.

114
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,800
Most of the time, it's kids playing at something they don't understand.

115
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,800
And that's not a slam against them. How could they understand it?

116
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,800
I was playing Mario Sunshine blissfully unaware when I was Greta's age.

117
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,800
Okay, I'm still playing it now in Game Boomers, but you get my point.

118
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,800
Here's another example.

119
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,800
I like Soph as a YouTuber, but I also recognize that she's a child who co-writes her videos with her older brother.

120
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,800
She's edgy, she's funny, and she's often wrong.

121
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:42,800
Soph on Alex Jones was only different from Greta on the international news by virtue of scope.

122
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,800
I don't want anyone holding up a kid as the next messiah.

123
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,800
And yet, here we are.

124
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,800
Greta's nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize,

125
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,800
an award made useless back when Obama won it for simply getting elected while black.

126
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,800
People are getting punished on social media for speaking out against Greta's ideas.

127
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:01,800
Or even saying objectively true things like she's been scared into extremism.

128
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:06,800
Were the radical left considered Soph to be brainwashed, Greta can do no wrong.

129
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,800
And the only thing that's going to come of this, when the whirlwind passes,

130
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:13,800
is a broken young adult who will still think the world is collapsing around her.

131
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,800
Who will think that she failed in her duty as a savior of humanity,

132
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,800
and will be suffering from crippling anxiety and depression because the limelight is gone

133
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,800
and the establishment has abandoned her to rot.

134
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,800
Either that, or she'll wholeheartedly embrace the activist role, David Hogg style,

135
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,800
make a career out of it, and become insufferable in the process.

136
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,800
Let me share with you a bit of Canadian history.

137
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,800
This is David Suzuki, one of Canada's most well-known intellectuals,

138
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,800
and a die-hard climate activist for like 30 years now.

139
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:45,800
His daughter, Severn Suzuki, spoke at the UN back in I think in 1992 on the subject of climate change.

140
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:50,800
Hello, I'm Severn Suzuki speaking for ECHO, the Environmental Children's Organization.

141
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,800
We're a group of 12 and 13 year olds trying to make a difference.

142
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,800
Vanessa Suttie, Morgan Geiszler, Michelle Quigg, and me.

143
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:08,800
We've raised all the money to come here ourselves, to come 5,000 miles to tell you adults you must change your ways.

144
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:15,800
Coming up here today, I have no hidden agenda. I am fighting for my future.

145
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:22,800
Losing my future is not like losing an election or a few points on the stock market.

146
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:27,800
I am here to speak for all generations to come.

147
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,800
So how much of that speech was her, and how much of it was David?

148
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,800
Care to hazard a guess?

149
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,800
And how much of it sounded like Greta's speech too?

150
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,800
It's the exact same playbook.

151
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:41,800
Parents who have their hands up their kids' asses, puppeting them to publicly push their politics,

152
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:45,800
and the media eats up the image of the brave youth speaking truth to power.

153
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,800
Severn Suzuki is now 39 years old.

154
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:51,800
She's made a career out of climate activism, following in her father's footsteps.

155
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:55,800
She has two children, who will probably one day be pushed into climate activism as well.

156
00:09:55,800 --> 00:10:01,800
And although her career has taken her all over the world, she's never lived outside of the hyper-lefty privileged bubbles

157
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,800
of either the British Columbia coast or the campus of Yale.

158
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,800
Severn has this to say about Greta.

159
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,800
She's calling for revolution, so of course she's getting pushback.

160
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,800
They're trying to silence her by discrediting her.

161
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,800
And that it's all because she's powerful.

162
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,800
This is weird, man.

163
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,800
It really feels like child grooming in a strange way.

164
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,800
Here's a woman who was shoved into the spotlight as a little girl by her high-profile father.

165
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:27,800
And now, as an adult, she's praising and encouraging doing what was done to her to the next generation.

166
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,800
I don't know how I feel about this.

167
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:33,800
I'm not saying there isn't a real scientific discussion to be had about climate change.

168
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,800
But that's the science side of the issue, not the politics side.

169
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:41,800
And they are two different things, no matter how hard the eco-fascists try to muddy the water on this.

170
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:47,800
On the political side, it is damaging and irresponsible to tell kids that the world will be barren of all life in the next decade.

171
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:51,800
We're saying that shit in the 80s, the 90s, and the 2000s, and yet we're still here.

172
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,800
Are there problems? Yes. Can we do something about them? Probably.

173
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,800
But this fear-mongering nonsense about the Earth turning into a wasteland has to stop.

174
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:05,800
Not only are generations losing out on a childhood due to this hysteria, but people are actually killing themselves over it.

175
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:10,800
People are losing their sex drive over it. People are vowing not to have children over it.

176
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,800
There's a wild theory out there that the reason YouTube is promoting how to live out of your van,

177
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:20,800
or how to squat in a shantytown content, and why the media is writing articles talking about eating bugs and eating human flesh,

178
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,800
is because they are preparing us for the climate catastrophe.

179
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,800
This nonsense has to stop.

180
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,800
Greta or any of the other kids here aren't the problem, they're the victims.

181
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:38,800
The worst part about the whole thing is that the eco-fascists blatantly admit that they're co-opting the scientific side of the discussion to serve as the political side.

182
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,800
To them, it's not even about saving the planet at all, it's about pushing their politics.

183
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,800
And all of these kids are just collateral damage.

184
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,800
Climate change is not just about climate change.

185
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:54,800
Climate change is about making sure that all people have equal opportunities and access to basic needs and to be able to thrive.

186
00:11:54,800 --> 00:12:01,800
Climate change is a problem about equity, it's a problem about race, it's a problem about how we relate to one another.

187
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:11,800
And so I think this climate crisis actually might provide us with an opportunity in a weird way to make the world the way that we want it to be,

188
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,800
not just avoid catastrophe.

189
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,800
There it is, right out of our own mouth.

190
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,800
It's not about the climate, it's about the great communist struggle.

191
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,800
But if you oppose it, then you're opposing science. What horseshit.

192
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,800
The world's not going to be done in a decade.

193
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,800
No, AOC, this is not our World War II.

194
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:31,800
And no, nobody believes you when you backtrack by saying it was a joke.

195
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,800
You're an eco-fascist, and this was your power play.

196
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,800
That's all the Green Deal was.

197
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,800
Let's talk about the elephant in the room.

198
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:44,800
Bindi Irwin, the daughter of Steve Irwin, the Crocodile Hunter, in 2009 was a climate activist.

199
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,800
At 14 years old, are you seeing a pattern yet?

200
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:53,800
Hillary Clinton was doing a youth activism climate e-journal thing at that time, as Secretary of State.

201
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:57,800
And her office was accepting essay submissions from young people regarding climate activism.

202
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:03,800
Bindi's essay won a spot in the journal, but Hillary's office, presumably not Hillary herself because let's be real,

203
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:07,800
heavily edited what they considered to be offensive content out of Bindi's essay.

204
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:13,800
The central thesis of Bindi's essay was that an ever-growing human population was the primary cause of climate change.

205
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:17,800
Not fossil fuel consumption, not garbage production, not anything else.

206
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,800
But printing this would have been political suicide for Hillary.

207
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,800
But is Bindi wrong?

208
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:28,800
If there were only 100 humans on Earth and they were all driving cars around and burning coal in the most dirty way possible,

209
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,800
and doing whatever else they could to fuck with the planet, they wouldn't cause climate change.

210
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:37,800
We output more carbon into the atmosphere today than we did at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution,

211
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:42,800
even though technology is significantly more clean because there's just that many more of us on the planet.

212
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:51,800
The real inconvenient truth is that if what the eco-fascists say are true, there's just too many of us and nothing we do will help the climate.

213
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:55,800
Modern agriculture relies on these forms of energy, at least for the moment.

214
00:13:55,800 --> 00:14:00,800
So if you actually want to return to a pre-carbon society, you're going to lose most of the world's food,

215
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,800
and soon after, most of the world's people, and that's just how it is.

216
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:08,800
However, bringing this up as a politician, like Hillary with the Bindi e-journal thing, is political suicide,

217
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,800
because it makes you sound like you're a raving mass murderer.

218
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:15,800
To solve climate change, we need to kill 90% of the human population is both a horrifying statement

219
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:21,800
and also the only way we know how to actually solve the problem if it's truly as bad as the eco-fascists claim.

220
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:25,800
Or you could always go the movie-bob eugenicist route and sterilize 90% of the human population.

221
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,800
Same thing will end up happening in 100 years.

222
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:31,800
My point is, the eco-fascists know all of this, and they don't say it,

223
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,800
because they don't actually believe in what they're saying.

224
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,800
Like AOC from earlier, backing down from the World War II comments,

225
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:41,800
if it truly was on the scale of World War II, if you actually believed that,

226
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:45,800
your solution wouldn't be, give me power and let me implement socialism.

227
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:48,800
The truth is, it's only ever been about implementing socialism.

228
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,800
It's never been about the environment.

229
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:55,800
By the way, I'm not advocating for killing or sterilizing everybody, obviously.

230
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,800
My point is, for how bad the eco-fascists say the situation is,

231
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:03,800
all of their proposed solutions, that you're bigoted and uneducated for not agreeing with, by the way,

232
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,800
have turned out to be limp-dicked power plays.

233
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:10,800
In my opinion, the actual solution is to use the vast energy that fossil fuel provides

234
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:15,800
to invent technologies that will allow us to power our society on cleaner future tech,

235
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,800
like hyper-efficient nuclear or whatever,

236
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,800
and then if we need to do some cleanup after it once we've got there, then we do it.

237
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,800
And by the way, that's actually what we're doing.

238
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:27,800
The majority of carbon's coming from India and China in the Middle East, not North America or Europe.

239
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:34,800
Oh, but to those countries that are still getting through the modernizing-towards-green-tech phase of Sid Meier's civilization,

240
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,800
Greta says drop dead.

241
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,800
I guess this is what you meant by the climate can't wait and the youth can't wait, eh?

242
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,800
I'll give you one final parting bit of hypocrisy on my way out.

243
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,800
In my opinion, the carbon being put into our air is a minor problem.

244
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:51,800
The serious environmental issue is the destruction of the oceans by ships dumping garbage out at sea.

245
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:55,800
The ocean is the planet's lungs, not the forests, Macron, you idiot,

246
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,800
and the widespread death of plankton is actually a serious problem

247
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,800
that needs solving within our lifetimes or you might actually be fucked.

248
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,800
At the same time, the destruction of the coral reefs is a major loss,

249
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,800
as those will take thousands of years to regrow.

250
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:11,800
It's not the air. The planet will sort that shit out eventually on its own, even if you don't develop ways to help it along.

251
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,800
It's the water.

252
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,800
But hey, who's doing most of the damage to the oceans?

253
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:19,800
Oh, it's India and China, and by a much wider margin compared to the West, too,

254
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,800
than with that carbon emissions thing.

255
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:25,800
I guess that's why the eco-fascists are largely silent on the oceans issue.

256
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,800
If the endgame is revolution, they'd rather side with who they view as their comrades.
