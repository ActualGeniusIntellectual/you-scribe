0	29960	Hey, we're back in the movie studio.
29960	34040	This time to talk about the newest Star Wars property, well, slightly newest.
34040	36200	The Obi-Wan Kenobi show has been done for about a month.
36200	40560	I figure that's enough time for the fanboys to stop soying out over it and start soying
40560	42880	out over Star Wars andor instead.
42880	45520	These shows seem to have a particular life cycle.
45520	49680	When the name is quietly printed at one of those corporate meetings, fans begin to rapidly
49680	57040	speculate.
57040	60320	Once the trailer drops, everyone uploads their reaction video where they're screaming and
60320	62560	crying and clapping and talking about how they've done it again.
62560	67200	Oh my god, it's a cultural phenomenon.
67200	71160	Then as the movie or the show or whatever actually premieres, everyone gets into a competition
71160	75760	on social media to see who can give Disney the deepest, most full-throated blowey they
75760	76760	can.
76760	80640	And then a month later, everyone finally comes to their senses and realizes, yeah, that was
80640	81640	kind of shit, wasn't it?
81640	85700	I've got a lot to say about the Obi-Wan Kenobi show, so it goes without saying that I'm going
85700	87340	to spoil pretty much everything.
87340	92140	Therefore, if for some ungodly reason you plan to watch this series yourself, you may
92140	93860	want to step away from this video.
93860	97460	Also, I'm very aware that multiple channels have already gone over the show in depth,
97460	100640	including Red Letter Media, EFAP, and It's a Gundam, and I'll try not to say the same
100640	103940	things that they do, but you know how this reviewing stuff goes sometimes.
103940	108100	Don't worry though, at the very least, I won't be autistically analyzing the different eras
108100	111700	of Darth Vader's suit to find inconsistencies in the costume.
111700	113820	Geez, Gundam, that was a bit too much even for me.
113820	116460	Oh, Vader does look like a cosplayer this time around.
116460	121140	Additionally, even though this video is an in-depth review of the Obi-Wan Kenobi show,
121140	125500	it's also a wider discussion of Star Wars as a whole, including at the end a political
125500	126500	discussion.
126500	127700	If you're not here for that, that's fine with me.
127700	131780	The Kenobi review ends and the meta conversation begins at about the halfway mark.
131780	140500	But enough goofing around, let's get this show on the road.
140500	143780	The first episode of Obi-Wan Kenobi begins with the supercut of the original trilogy,
143780	146880	and I gotta say, they cut the shit out of these movies.
146880	150380	Just to let you really young Zoomers know, the internet did actually exist 20 years ago
150380	154540	when the prequel trilogy came out, and forum posts and later YouTube videos of the day
154540	157540	considered these three movies to be dogshit.
157540	161620	That's all it takes for Cypher to give up his whole life in service to some evil mastermind.
161620	165820	Honestly, is Cypher the most easily manipulated little worm on the planet or what?
165820	170320	Who's going to believe that a hero, young and reckless though he may be, is simply going
170320	175520	to abandon his entire life and his career in a prestigious, respected order of warrior
175520	180080	knights just because some evil wizard challenges his feelings of powerlessness and impotence
180080	183640	and offers him the chance that power and respect he feels he's been denied.
183640	185280	You're not all powerful.
185280	187120	Well, I should be.
187120	190240	I will be the most powerful Jedi ever.
190240	195520	But at the very least, people are nostalgic for them, despite or perhaps because of their
195520	196520	flaws.
196520	199720	I think that's why the meme of shitting on the prequels versus the sequels caught
199720	200720	on for a while.
200720	202880	People know the prequels are bad, but they love them anyway.
202880	203880	They can take a joke.
203880	208660	Anyway, despite these being three shitty movies, this supercut makes them look amazing.
208660	209660	The music's great.
209660	212080	They show Anakin's life and his relationship with Obi-Wan.
212080	213080	It's justâ€¦
213080	214080	Mwah.
214080	217680	It was watching this when I realized that I think I love the idea of Star Wars more
217680	219920	than the execution of Star Wars at this point.
219920	224160	There's this rich universe full of lore and characters and organizations and conflicts
224160	227680	and all this history, and then we get shit like this.
227680	235960	The first actual scene of the Obi-Wan show has some Jedi younglings practicing Tai Chi
235960	236960	or something.
236960	241680	It looks all nice and serene and then suddenly Order 66 happens and the shaky cam begins.
241680	242680	Watch it.
242680	243680	This is laughable.
243680	246160	It looks like the cameraman was pulling back and then tripped over an apple box or something.
246160	250400	We get to witness Jedi fighting clone troopers during that historic moment, setting up Riva
250400	251400	in the process.
251640	255640	Yes, I am pretty sure that everybody and their mother knew that this was Riva on their first
255640	256640	viewing.
256640	258120	It's not exactly hard to figure out what they're doing here.
258120	262600	There's no reason to remake the Order 66 scene when you've already flashed back to
262600	265960	the original footage, unless you're going to add some new information.
265960	269400	We cut to the present day, which is ten years later, approximately halfway between Revenge
269400	270640	of the Sith and A New Hope.
270640	274560	The setting is Tatooine, specifically a reuse of the Tatooine set from The Mandalorian and
274560	275560	Boba Fett.
275560	276560	Hey, if you've got it, why not?
276560	280900	The Inquisitors have come to town, an elite group of Force-sensitives that hunt Jedi on
280900	281900	behalf of the Empire.
281900	284620	Oh, come on, dude, why'd you have to park in the middle of the road?
284620	286420	We've got a spaceport, you know.
286420	290580	The Grand Inquisitor, along with Umbrella Hat Man, are both characters from Star Wars
290580	293660	Rebels, with established personalities and story arcs.
293660	297620	Fun fact, the Grand Inquisitor in that show was played by Jason Isaacs, the guy who did
297620	302360	both Draco's dad in Harry Potter and Captain Lorca in Star Trek Discovery, the only legitimately
302360	304260	interesting thing about that show's first season.
304260	307940	Upon learning that his character was heading towards the live-action screen, Jason Isaacs
307940	309820	expressed interest in playing him there, too.
309860	311580	But alas, we got this guy instead.
311580	315060	I'm sorry, I don't know him for anything, but his filmography isn't nearly as extensive
315060	318540	or high-profile, and I am wondering if it was a budget issue, considering Kenobi feels
318540	319900	kind of cheap all around.
319900	323300	It turns out that Kenobi only had a $90 million budget.
323300	327540	That's actually not that much in comparison to the $100 million for a season of The Mandalorian
327540	333120	or Boba Fett, or the $150 million that Moon Knight and Ms. Marvel, or the non-Disney offerings
333120	336820	of Star Trek Picard and Star Trek Strange New Worlds all commanded.
336820	340460	I think that's why, despite the aesthetically impressive offerings of the slum planet of
340460	345820	Dayu and the underwater fortress Inquisitorius, overall the Kenobi show feels rather drab.
345820	349540	The other locations are the beige rocks of Tatooine, the red rocks of Jabiim, the brown
349540	353780	rocks of the nameless planet that only exists to duel on, and the black rocks of a quarry
353780	354780	in California.
354780	358700	Multiple ships use the same cockpit set, just recolored, in an attempt to make it look like
358700	359700	it's a new place.
359700	363560	A lack of money is the only explanation I can think of as to why the show can make some
363560	366700	things look so good and other things look so cheap.
366700	374740	The thing that we really aspire to constantly is quality.
374740	378420	Maybe they couldn't afford to take on another big name beyond Owen McGregor, and it sucks
378420	382420	too because Jason Isaacs is great, and, more importantly, he's got the correct shaped
382420	383420	head.
383420	387160	No, really, the Grand Inquisitor is supposed to be a member of the Pau'an race, yeah these
387160	388160	guys from episode 3.
388160	391660	With the long skinny bald heads, these effects were made with a combination of prosthetics
391660	393780	with a little bit of CG to add a few extra touches.
393780	396280	But I guess they just didn't have the budget for all that in Kenobi.
396860	398160	It would have looked a little bit better on Isaacs, though.
398160	401960	They're also missing the full suite of cranial ridges, no no no I'm not going to go full
401960	403200	autist like Gundam did.
403200	407360	This scene serves to set up the Inquisitors, what they do, the Jedi in their current situation,
407360	409620	and the conflict between Riva and the Grand Inquisitor.
409620	412140	But it does it just so poorly.
412140	413600	Why is the dialogue so stilted?
413600	415320	We should be hunting bigger prey.
415320	420640	He is not yours to find, we are past this third sister, I will not warn you again.
420640	425520	You will forget this fixation with Kenobi or I will relieve you of your duties, is that
425520	426520	clear?
426520	429480	Why do you just grimace menacingly at the Jedi and not stop him?
429480	433360	Why does a fallen tarp stop the chase, literally just go the fuck around it?
433360	435240	The catching up with Obi-Wan stuff has done pretty well.
435240	438680	There's a lot of good character moments here, and they do a good job of showing, not
438680	439680	telling.
439680	443320	The drudgery of Obi-Wan's daily job, butchering a rotting sand whale, especially compared
443320	444960	to the prestige of his previous life.
444960	448520	How he appears powerless and oppressed whenever injustice happens.
448520	452240	How he isolates himself in a cave and has flashbacks to the pre-cultural events in his
452240	454040	dreams, even events he wasn't even present for.
454080	456840	I guess we didn't need that pre-show recap after all.
456840	461000	During those lonely nights Obi-Wan spends time with his anteater face, hahaha don't
461000	462000	look that one up.
462000	465740	But in all seriousness this is a depressed Obi-Wan, and we spend like half the episode
465740	466740	setting it up.
466740	469600	This is legitimately good stuff, even if the writing is kinda shitty.
469600	471360	You have no idea what I've been through.
471360	473320	Uh, I might have an idea dude.
473320	477120	We also set up the conflict between Obi-Wan and Uncle Owen, something that is only lightly
477120	478120	touched on in A New Hope.
478120	480300	I wonder if he's related to Ben.
480300	482020	That wizard's just a crazy old man.
482020	485620	This is a natural plotline though, that Obi-Wan would be buzzing around like a weird stalker,
485620	487980	while Owen just wants to get on with his life and bury the past.
487980	490300	It's pretty easy to feel for both of these characters.
490300	492580	Owen truly does want what's best for Luke.
492580	495420	Meanwhile Obi-Wan's clearly having PTSD just looking at the kid.
495420	513500	Nonetheless, these two are truly quite stupid characters.
513500	517700	They have private conversations about Obi-Wan being a Jedi, Luke being a Jedi, etc. in the
517700	524500	open fucking street.
524500	526460	Can you guys take this shit inside maybe?
526460	532180	Ride Obi-Wan's farting anteater back home?
532180	536180	Seriously this guy says rewards will be given and you're just going to drop a thank you
536180	538680	in the crowd?
538680	541180	You think these people won't sell you out for money?
541180	544860	The show then cuts to Princess Leia Organa, future leader of a very well known asteroid
544860	545860	belt.
545860	549000	They do a lot of work setting her up too, with Bail Organa returning from episode 3.
549000	552120	Her life as a princess, there's a bunch of noble family stuff in there, but it's clear
552120	556280	she wants no part of it, opting to spend her time running away from the palace to hang
556280	558320	out in the woods with her droid, Lola.
558320	561200	Which by the way, was an idea originally from the prequels.
561200	565080	A vision of Padme having a hovering personal droid companion was something that didn't
565080	566740	make it out of the concept stage.
566740	570640	Also at one point she had a falcon too, I wouldn't mind seeing falconer Leia.
570640	573400	At this point I will ask the obvious question.
573400	576760	If you're going to do an Obi-Wan story, and it's not just going to be about his shitty
576760	579440	life in the desert, what do you do?
579440	581320	Do you have him butt heads with Uncle Owen?
581320	584800	I mean of course, that's a natural extension of already established stories.
584800	585800	But what else?
585800	587600	You can't make him go have a huge adventure with Luke.
587600	592100	A new hope firmly establishes that Luke knows of Obi-Wan as Ben Kenobi, but they're not
592100	601160	friends or acquaintances.
601160	602160	So what do you do?
602160	603920	You include a Leia storyline instead I guess.
603920	604920	And you know what?
604920	608600	If you skim over a new hope, you'll realize that Leia and Obi-Wan don't actually share
608600	609640	any scenes together.
609640	613160	While Obi-Wan is spending his time kickstarting Luke's hero's journey, Leia is on the Death
613160	614160	Star.
614160	617640	By the time Luke, Han and Chewie rescue Leia, Obi-Wan has already gone off on his own.
617640	619600	So putting them together now is perfect right?
619600	623440	Well I'm pretty sure that the only thing the people making this show did was skim the
623440	624440	old content.
624440	628200	Because if Leia actually went on this huge epic adventure with Obi-Wan that we see in
628200	635960	the show, she'd probably be reacting just like Luke does when he dies.
635960	639080	Does this look like a woman who's just lost a close friend and mentor?
639080	642880	With whom she bopped around the galaxy a decade earlier during her most formative years?
642880	646040	This is the look of somebody who's like, are you fucking kidding me, did this kid just
646040	647040	blow our cover?
647040	652920	Yeah dude, Leia does not give a fuck that Obi-Wan's dead.
652920	657160	Anyway, we need to kick off this Obi-Wan and Leia adventure that totally happened somehow.
657160	658440	So Leia gets kidnapped.
658440	660960	But not before a tense chase scene through Alderaan's woods.
660960	667180	And by tense I mean cartoonish.
667180	670260	This is the sort of thing that you'd expect to see on a Disney Kids series, where the
670260	673900	adults are somehow slow and incompetent, and the tiny child keeps managing to get away.
673900	678160	In fact, there's like four running scenes with Leia, and they all follow this formula.
678160	680540	Somehow grown ass adults just can't keep up with her.
680540	684680	So Leia's kidnapped, and Bail Organa wants Obi-Wan to come out of hiding at great personal
684680	686500	risk to himself, and sort it out.
686500	688820	For some reason he's not going to ask the Empire for help.
688820	692300	Because remember, at this point in the timeline, Organa is an Imperial Senator for a planet
692300	693300	under the protection of the Empire.
693300	697100	And I know the Empire is evil and all, but it still ultimately values rule of law, and
697100	700900	considers abducting an Imperial Senator's daughter a grave offense, as the Grand Inquisitor
700900	705780	will tell us next episode.
705780	708100	Nor does Bail consider sending out his own personal guard.
708100	711780	Yeah, those guys in the background with funny hats, that get completely shot up and destroyed
711780	713260	in A New Hope and Rogue One.
713260	715900	Alderaan has its own security force, he could send those.
715900	719460	Hell, if for some reason, Organa wanted to keep it a secret, he could call it bounty
719460	720460	hunters.
720460	721620	That's literally their job in this universe.
721620	724180	Hired muscle for when you don't want the authorities finding out.
724180	726220	No, he just wants Obi-Wan.
726220	727220	But here's why.
727220	730700	Only you know how important she really is, Obi-Wan.
730700	733180	Wait a second, how important is she?
733180	736300	I mean, yeah, she's Anakin's daughter, and Luke's son.
736300	737300	That's pretty important.
737300	741520	But only insofar as Anakin's personal feelings, and maybe some sort of succession or legitimacy
741520	742700	thing down the line?
742700	746580	Yes, Bail loves his daughter, but they're acting like she's a child of destiny or something.
746580	747860	My duty is to the boy.
747860	751500	What about your duty to his sister?
751500	753440	She's as important as he is.
753440	756760	There was that whole stupid prophecy thing that George Lucas invented for the prequels
756760	761160	about Anakin bringing balance to the force, but his kids aren't named in the prophecy.
761160	764840	You refer to the prophecy of the one who will bring balance to the force.
764840	767160	Also in the end, Anakin didn't bring balance to the force.
767160	773040	You and the chosen one bring balance to the force, not leave it in darkness.
773040	776040	I know George Lucas later confirmed in an interview that it was Luke who fulfilled the
776040	777440	prophecy in episode 6.
777440	782440	The prophecy is that Anakin will bring balance to the force and destroy the Sith.
782440	787100	He becomes Darth Vader, Darth Vader does become the hero, Darth Vader does destroy
787100	790440	the Sith, meaning himself and the Emperor.
790440	793680	He does it because he is redeemed by his son.
793680	797640	But even that didn't matter because Luke's school fell apart, and by the end of the sequel
797640	799880	trilogy there's no Jedi or Sith anymore or anything.
799880	801080	Is that what balance meant?
801080	802920	I guess everyone's equal when they're dead.
802920	807840	Anyway, my point is, Leia is important politically, as both the Senator's daughter and secretly
807840	808840	Anakin's daughter.
808840	810700	But insofar as Bail Organa knows, that's it.
810740	814500	They're treating her like she's supremely important, and yeah she is to the future movies,
814500	815500	but these guys don't know that.
815500	817460	Are they reading the fucking scripts or something?
817460	821900	They're even treating her as more important than Luke, who actually does become the hero,
821900	825780	and who Obi-Wan is all too happy to abandon his watch over to go on this adventure.
825780	828500	Dude, hide your lightsaber, like what the fuck?
828500	831460	The blue tunic was actually a good look on you, man, Obi-Wan should have stayed in that
831460	832460	the whole adventure.
832460	836100	Why would you dig up the old dirty Jedi robes and then just hang the lightsaber off them
836100	837100	for all to see?
837100	840260	Is that what secretly gives a Jedi his powers, the unwashed robes?
840300	843060	So, Obi-Wan arrives in the Blade Runner planet of Dio.
843060	844060	And you know what?
844060	846220	They did a pretty good job with the art direction here, all things considered.
846220	849500	There's even that nice touch of bringing back Boba Fett's actor to play an aging
849500	851800	clone trooper who's now down on his luck.
851800	854020	You can see Obi-Wan getting flashbacks as soon as he sees him.
854020	857140	I have a feeling that maybe the clone trooper should have recognized Obi-Wan since, you
857140	859420	know, Order 66, but still, this is good stuff.
859420	861220	We're introduced to Haja, who's a scam artist.
861220	864580	He pretends to be a Jedi using tricks in sleight of hand to fleece people, which again, I
864580	865580	don't mind.
865580	868140	That's the kind of person you'd find in a scum bucket city like this.
868140	870300	He is what passes for this story's comic relief.
870300	874980	And, like most comedy written by nihilistic millennials, he's only really got one note.
874980	875980	Being sardonic.
875980	877860	And hey, to his credit, it's sometimes funny.
877860	880160	But for the most part, he overstays his welcome in every scene he's in.
880160	884900	Due to the usual hijinks, Haja ends up leading Obi-Wan to the drug operation the gangsters
884900	886820	who kidnapped Leia are operating out of.
886820	890520	Obi-Wan is taken prisoner, he breaks out, he breaks Leia out, Leia doesn't trust him,
890520	893860	she runs away, he catches up, Leia doesn't trust him again, she runs away again, this
893860	897960	time into a rooftop firefight against a punk rocker from that dinosaur show, and a robot
897960	907560	who is more stiff than Hayden Christensen's acting in Attack of the Clones.
907560	912040	I'm really skimming over this quickly, because every scene is extremely painful and contrived.
912040	916160	Awful dialogue, forced chase scenes, completely counterintuitive character moments.
916160	919800	It feels like a Disney executive said to the writers, this episode needs a rooftop shootout,
919800	923480	a street level chase scene, a drug lab, and a cargo port, because that's what the analytics
923480	924480	say will be good.
924480	928320	Then the writing department padded it out with really bad dialogue and scenes of Alan
928320	944640	McGregor playing with children.
944640	947920	But it's not only the props and the sets and the algorithms that they're writing around,
947920	951560	but also the phenomenon that I mentioned in my Boba Fett video, that I called Cool Scene
951560	952560	Itis.
952560	955720	That final shot of the previous episode, with the lightsaber hanging off Obi-Wan's belt,
955720	957060	that's a perfect example.
957060	960520	Disney wanted that trailer bait shot, something that fanboys would shed tears over in their
960520	961620	reaction videos.
961620	965320	Even though it's literally the dumbest fucking thing, because walking around with a lightsaber
965320	968800	while Inquisitors are hunting Jedi is a fast track to getting your face shoved into the
968800	969800	meat grinder.
969800	973920	But it looks cool, you got the iconic imagery, the swelling orchestra, Obi-Wan's back baby!
973920	977760	They're pursuing these moments at the expense of the cohesiveness of the plot.
977760	981200	At this point in the story it's implied that Obi-Wan's connection to the Force has
981200	985800	withered away along with the rest of him.
985800	988120	Leia's hanging on by a thread and Obi-Wan's in a bind.
988120	990140	Either he uses the Force or she dies.
990140	993880	It's that pressure cooker moment where the hero finally steps up, and of course Obi-Wan
993880	994880	does.
994880	997600	Wait a second though, this isn't the first time Obi-Wan used the Force in the show, is
997600	998600	it?
998600	1000880	Earlier in the episode, when Obi-Wan was breaking into the drug compound, he notices
1000880	1003040	that the door going into the back is locked.
1003040	1007040	His plan is to cause one of the drug beakers to over boil and explode, causing a commotion,
1007040	1010920	upon which he pickpockets the key from the guard and slips in while everyone's distracted.
1010920	1014320	But watch the scene again, he enters from the right and then faces the front wall, where
1014320	1015320	the camera is.
1015320	1017040	It's the blue beaker behind him that explodes.
1017040	1020400	He doesn't adjust any knobs with his hands or anything, not that there are any knobs
1020400	1021400	where he is.
1021400	1024360	It's just a shelf of materials and some chemical canisters that aren't hooked up
1024360	1025360	to anything.
1025360	1028520	And with his back turned to the beaker, it blows up all on its own, which is when he
1028520	1029520	slips in.
1029520	1030520	Am I crazy?
1030520	1033960	Because this seems like he used the Force to turn a knob over on the burner, or drastically
1033960	1035400	heat the liquid up or something.
1035400	1038520	And everyone that I was watching this with took it that way too, we were all confused
1038520	1042040	like, why are they doing a big Obi-Wan has to use the Force for the first time scene?
1042040	1043720	Didn't we just see him use it?
1043720	1048200	Meanwhile, it's revealed that Raeva is the one who hired the thugs to kidnap Leia, specifically
1048200	1051640	for the purpose of drawing Obi-Wan out, so that she can capture him and make a name for
1051640	1052640	herself.
1052640	1055360	The other Inquisitors are outraged because, you know, the Imperial Senator's daughter
1055360	1056360	thing.
1056360	1058000	And this is when we get handed this beauty of a scene.
1058000	1061440	I found a link between him and Organa in the archives.
1061440	1063000	I used the girl as bait.
1063000	1064420	You hear that line?
1064420	1067860	I found a link between him and Organa in the archives.
1067860	1069980	I used the girl as bait.
1069980	1070980	That is a redub.
1070980	1072140	I should know, I do them all the time.
1072140	1074580	If you've got a sharp enough ear, you've been doing this sort of thing long enough,
1074580	1075700	it's not hard to spot.
1075700	1078740	Every time you set up to do voice recording, even if it's the same location, the same
1078740	1082780	microphone, the same equipment, the same people, it always sounds just slightly different.
1082780	1085420	Maybe the mic is in just a slightly different position relative to your mouth.
1085420	1086500	Maybe you're sitting differently.
1086500	1088460	Maybe the moisture content in the air is a little different.
1088460	1092160	Whatever the case is, no two recording sessions sound exactly alike.
1092160	1096260	In fact, this video is so huge, I'm doing two recording sessions on two different days
1096260	1097260	just to get it all done.
1097260	1099680	Let me know in the comments if you can tell when day two starts.
1099680	1102700	So listen to that scene again and really open your ears.
1102700	1106140	I found a link between him and Organa in the archives.
1106140	1108020	I used the girl as bait.
1108020	1112460	They added the line, I found a link between him and Organa in the archives in post, presumably
1112460	1116740	because they realized after shooting that there is no way anybody should know about
1116740	1118300	a connection between Obi-Wan and Leia.
1118300	1121180	Hell, there's no way that anyone should know that Leia's adopted at all.
1121180	1124020	You know, my father says they never let you leave this planet.
1124020	1131140	Yeah, I know, Bail's wife probably didn't appear pregnant, but you can fake that shit.
1131140	1132140	Fake records and pictures?
1132140	1133140	It's the goddamn future.
1133140	1137300	If Stalin could airbrush literally everybody out of existence, surely wifey here could
1137300	1139260	have been given a baby bump in a picture.
1139260	1143380	Sure, there's no automatic reason to suspect that Bail's publicly adopted daughter is
1143380	1147660	actually the believed to be dead child of Padme Amidala, but why even leave the door
1147660	1148660	open?
1148660	1152340	So what is this connection that Riva dug up from the archives that is so important that
1152340	1154700	Obi-Wan would come out of hiding to rescue Leia?
1154700	1157500	Is it that Bail, Organa, and Obi-Wan knew each other back in the day?
1157500	1158500	That's not really enough.
1158500	1160740	Bail's a senator and Obi-Wan was a Jedi Master.
1160740	1164700	There's plenty of reason that both men would know any number of other state officials or
1164700	1166680	military officials or other important people.
1166680	1168740	They had a working relationship isn't enough.
1168740	1172220	Either the archives showed an extremely tenuous circumstantial connection between Obi-Wan
1172220	1176140	and Bail, and therefore Riva should be executed on the spot by the Grand Inquisitor for taking
1176140	1180820	such an insane and stupid gambit, or the archives showed a rock solid connection between Bail
1180820	1184740	and Obi-Wan, and therefore a garrison of stormtroopers should be en route to Alderaan
1184740	1188760	immediately to extract any Jedi information from the Organa family and then send them
1188760	1191380	off to concentration camps to be turned into Soylent drinks.
1191380	1195500	But the show won't commit to either of these possibilities, because the plot simultaneously
1195500	1199780	demands them both, plausible enough to kinda act on, but not plausible enough to really
1199780	1200780	act on.
1200780	1202420	Riva does get punished for this though.
1202420	1205840	The Grand Inquisitor benches her and takes over the pursuit of Kenobi himself, so she
1205840	1209980	decides to go do her best Batman impression by hanging out on the rooftops of the city,
1209980	1211940	hoping for some reason that Obi-Wan will show up there.
1211940	1213200	And of course, he does.
1213200	1217340	This leads to a completely meaningless set of scenes where Riva does some very slow,
1217340	1221140	poorly choreographed Force parkour to try and get to the gunfight in time.
1221140	1222980	Which she doesn't, so whatever.
1222980	1227020	Back on the ground, Haja tells Obi-Wan to take an automated cargo transport to bypass
1227020	1228720	the Empire shutting down all the shuttles.
1228720	1232620	It's pre-programmed to take them to a safehouse because it turns out he's part of the Rebellion.
1232620	1236500	It's at this point that I realize that I really, really hate Leia's character.
1236500	1240860	She's simultaneously the dumb, naive kid and the wise-beyond-her-years Serene Princess
1240860	1244620	and you can't be both of those things.
1244620	1245620	Who?
1245620	1246620	Fucking Jar Jar?
1246620	1250220	Riva shows up though, so Obi-Wan stays behind to give Leia time to get to safety.
1250220	1252340	Start a counter on this one kids, it happens a lot.
1252340	1254060	So Leia runs ahead to the cargo transport.
1254060	1257700	A transport made only for cargo, not designed for humans to be in it.
1257700	1259900	Okay, so why are there human-sized doors?
1259900	1261780	And human chairs for people to sit on?
1261780	1264460	Also, why can you breathe in the ship when it goes into space?
1264460	1266300	Ah whatever, we can't worry about that too much.
1266300	1294320	We have this monumentally stupid fucking scene to watch.
1294320	1310220	So Obi-Wan knows that Anakin Skywalker is Darth Vader.
1310220	1313160	Vader does keep his real identity a secret from the wider public.
1313160	1316320	There's a lot of stories out there where he kills people he used to know or who somehow
1316320	1317320	found out.
1317320	1321040	It's kind of the equivalent of Vader wanting his old Anakin Twitter account buried because
1321040	1323520	there's some edgy shit on there and he lost the password, you know?
1323520	1327360	But Vader himself isn't a secret, he's the public face of the Empire, that's the
1327360	1328360	point of the guy.
1328360	1332480	Darth Vader is the name whispered by the people as a cautionary tale to not fuck with the
1332480	1333480	Empire.
1333480	1337120	Are you seriously telling me that after ten fucking years, word never made it back to
1337120	1341920	Obi-Wan that there's a dude in a pressure sealed burn protective suit named Darth fucking
1341920	1345120	Vader running around acting as the Empire's front man?
1345120	1347760	Does the newspaper just not get delivered on Tatooine or what?
1347760	1350840	Anyway, Riva kills the Grand Inquisitor.
1350840	1353360	Everyone knew he was coming back because Star Wars Rebels takes place later in the timeline
1353360	1354360	and he's in that show.
1354360	1358160	Though, to be honest, some people genuinely believed that Disney would violate their own
1358160	1360800	new canon just for the hell of it, including me for a little bit.
1360800	1364100	This did lead to some funny moments of Internet salt, the best of which probably being this
1364100	1365100	post on Reddit.
1365100	1367600	I'm so tired of people complaining about stupid shit.
1367600	1369320	Obviously, the Grand Inquisitor isn't dead.
1369320	1372080	He's in Rebels and Pow-An have two stomachs.
1372080	1376020	Oh, is that the reason why he's not dead?
1376020	1377020	Get stabbed in the stomach.
1377020	1378020	Oh, it's no problem.
1378020	1379020	You got another one.
1379020	1381320	Yeah, if you're with the spine or the aorta or any of their surrounding organs, you got
1381320	1382320	two stomachs, buddy.
1382320	1383320	Just use the other one.
1384280	1385280	It'll be okay.
1385280	1388840	Obi-Wan manages to escape onto the cargo ship with Riva waving her sword menacingly.
1388840	1390600	But isn't there a garrison on the planet now?
1390600	1392520	Surely there's Imperial ships in orbit or something.
1392520	1394720	All Riva has to do is call it in and they'll stop the transport.
1394720	1397960	Okay, we know Riva's setting this up as a double-cross invader, so maybe she won't
1397960	1398960	do it.
1398960	1402800	But why not Umbrella Hat Man or Reptile Hijab Lady or any of the other soldiers?
1402800	1404320	Maybe the Grand Inquisitor could do it.
1404320	1406060	You know, before Vader puts him in the bacta tank?
1406060	1410200	I have to tell you, before I pass out, my lord, Obi-Wan is on that ship.
1410200	1411280	And there you go, right as rain.
1411280	1414440	I know Hijab's explanation is that it's an automated ship, so the Empire will ignore
1414440	1415440	it.
1415440	1416440	That's kind of stupid, isn't it?
1416440	1417440	It's a cargo port.
1417440	1418440	It's fully automated.
1418440	1419440	They won't be looking for you there.
1419440	1420840	Wouldn't they just stop it just to be sure?
1420840	1423880	Well, they didn't shoot C-3PO and Archer D-2's escape pod either.
1423880	1424880	Hold your fire.
1424880	1425880	There's no lifeforms.
1425880	1426880	They must have short-circuited.
1426880	1431260	Maybe the Empire really is just fucking dumb when it comes to letting important ships slip
1431260	1433520	by, because censors say no one's on board.
1433520	1435500	But wait, Obi-Wan and Leia aren't droids.
1435500	1436680	They would know someone's on board.
1436680	1439340	It doesn't matter, though, because they find out where Obi-Wan went anyway.
1439340	1441820	Because Riva mind-sucked the information out of Haja.
1441820	1443300	Wait a minute.
1443300	1444300	Mind-suck the information?
1444300	1447660	Yeah, I know that Kylo Ren did that to Poe, and that was justified because Vader kinda
1447660	1449240	did it to Luke in Return of the Jedi.
1449240	1452980	Though that scene seemed like less of a mind-suck and more of a sensing-his-feelings sort of
1452980	1453980	thing.
1453980	1458840	But if Jedis and Siths can actually mind-suck information out of people, why didn't Vader
1458840	1462580	just do that to Leia without resorting to the drug droid in Episode 4?
1462580	1465580	After Riva got the archives, why didn't she just go to Alderaan?
1465580	1466580	Okay, it's guarded.
1466580	1470380	Wait with Bail at some official Empire function, then, and mind-suck him there to find out
1470380	1471380	where Kenobi is.
1471380	1474180	Bail clearly knows, and Riva knows he knows.
1474180	1478320	And oh boy, if she did that, wouldn't that unearth a treasure trove of information.
1478320	1482620	At this point in the timeline, not any Legends retcon shit, but Disney's own lore, Bail
1482620	1486500	Organa is the secret leader of the Rebel Alliance in the Star Wars Rebels show.
1486500	1489900	That's one big fuckin' way to blow your cover, Bail, and risk the entirety of the
1489900	1493220	Rebel Alliance by sticking your neck out towards Obi-Wan stupidly.
1493220	1496700	Also, why didn't Bail ask any of the Jedi that are part of the Rebel Alliance at this
1496700	1500180	point, including Ahsoka Tano, who is Darth Vader's former Padawan?
1500180	1503800	You know, maybe Obi-Wan would want to know that she's alive, considering their mutual
1503800	1505300	familial bond with Anakin.
1505300	1509820	Hell, Bail would know that Darth Vader is still around, being a Senator himself.
1509820	1513860	And though we never see it on screen, presumably he knows that Darth Vader is Anakin, since
1513860	1517100	he's present at the secret meeting at the end of Revenge of the Sith.
1517100	1520540	Why wouldn't he tell Obi-Wan, hey if you're gonna go save Leia for me, just know that
1520540	1521980	Anakin still rang around out there?
1521980	1524820	Is it because he thinks Obi-Wan won't take the job if he knows?
1524820	1526220	What an asshole.
1526220	1528260	After arriving on the planet, I don't even remember what it's called, it's just
1528260	1529780	the mining planet, cause fuck it.
1529780	1533100	After learning that Anakin is still alive, Obi-Wan's having PTSD visions of him off
1533100	1534100	in the distance.
1534100	1535600	Well, actually, just one vision.
1535600	1536600	And they never bring it up again.
1536600	1539540	They could have done something really cool with this idea, but they just drop it.
1539540	1543580	Instead, we get more out-of-character dialogue between Obi-Wan and Leia again, and this time
1543580	1545060	it's really weird.
1545060	1548860	This is where he told us to come to.
1548860	1551000	Maybe they're just late?
1551000	1552000	Maybe it was a lie.
1552000	1553000	I knew it.
1553000	1554000	I never should have trusted him.
1554000	1555460	We don't know his name.
1555460	1557400	No one is coming here, Leia.
1557400	1559820	Holy jeez, chill out dude, you just got here.
1559820	1563280	They hitch a ride with cloaca face here when a bunch of soldiers looking for a Jedi pile
1563280	1564280	in.
1564280	1566320	Shouldn't these guys recognize Obi-Wan?
1566320	1569120	This is no ordinary Jedi.
1569120	1573280	Kenobi is the last ember of a dying age.
1573280	1576880	Surely the Empire would have told them which Jedi they're hunting out here, right?
1576880	1579180	Are you sure he's even on this planet?
1579180	1581500	They know what they're doing, Leia.
1581500	1584460	You called her Leia.
1584460	1588160	Oh my god, dude, they also know that Leia is missing.
1588160	1592020	This is the kind of goof up that you'd see in Spaceballs or one of the Family Guy spoof
1592020	1593020	movies.
1593020	1594580	Not in an actual Star Wars show.
1594580	1598260	Anyway, the soldiers somehow don't recognize him, and they get off at their stop, giving
1598260	1600740	us space for another Obi-Wan-Leia bonding moment.
1600740	1602740	Are you my real father?
1602740	1606340	I wish I could say I was.
1606340	1610020	Dude, is this you admitting that you wanted to fuck pad me?
1610020	1613380	That makes this scene hit different.
1613380	1617580	But our guy Freck sells him out at the next Imperial checkpoint because, I don't know,
1617580	1627900	you talked about being a Jedi in the back seat?
1627900	1631780	All throughout this show Obi-Wan has a bad fucking habit of spilling the beans in public,
1631780	1632780	let me tell you.
1632780	1635460	Obi-Wan is asked to step out of the vehicle and he complies.
1635460	1637700	Good move dude, never fight the cops, always get your day in court.
1637700	1642140	And the scanner droid is brought in to finally face ID him with the Empire's Facebook Chinese
1642140	1645900	algorithm shit, upon which Obi-Wan blasts it in the camera, completely destroying it.
1645900	1648980	Now we all remember in the original trilogy scanner droids being incredibly weak, and
1648980	1652380	every time they show up they get downed in one shot, but they're actually not that fragile.
1652380	1655820	Yeah, there's that scene in Empire where Han takes one out in two shots, but everyone always
1655820	1656820	forgets the next line.
1656820	1659380	I didn't hit it that hard, it must have had a self-destruct.
1659380	1663000	Yeah, it purposely destroyed itself after sending information back to the Empire so
1663000	1664920	that the Rebellion wouldn't get any intelligence.
1664920	1666680	But I guess they're all just made out of paper mache now.
1666680	1670640	In probably the second most notorious fight scene in the show, because a dude gratuitously
1670640	1674800	falls into the laser gate and gets fucking vivisected, jesus christ, Obi-Wan takes out
1674800	1676800	the stormtroopers but also takes out Freck.
1676800	1677800	What the hell man?
1677800	1681640	Obi-Wan doesn't know that Freck sold him out, he said that quietly to the stormtroopers.
1681640	1683520	Look at Obi-Wan's face.
1683520	1686280	It could have been just a routine check, it is a checkpoint you know.
1686280	1688800	And Obi-Wan's just like, well fuck you, bonk.
1688800	1690120	Dude just go around it.
1690120	1693400	Just go around the laser wall, you're literally outdoors, it's a hill, go around it.
1693400	1697160	Anyway, Tala, that chick from Game of Thrones, arrives and picks up Obi-Wan after slaughtering
1697160	1698160	her own unit.
1698160	1699160	Surprise!
1699160	1700920	She's a mole within the Empire working for the Rebellion.
1700920	1704320	And she reveals that if Obi-Wan was just a bit more patient, none of this would have
1704320	1705320	happened.
1705320	1706320	He gave you the right coordinates.
1706320	1708320	I was on my way when the probes arrived but you'd already gone.
1708320	1710520	I hadn't expected anyone to come.
1710520	1712560	Oh, imagine that Obi-Wan.
1712560	1715780	Look at just how many people died because you couldn't take a breather.
1715780	1716780	Look at poor Freck.
1716780	1718860	Also, guys, you're visible on the fucking street.
1718860	1720780	Why didn't you put on stormtrooper armor?
1720780	1722300	We know it comes off easy enough.
1722340	1725300	Why didn't you suit up for this instead of running around the town square on your Jedi
1725300	1727220	robes you should have left back on Tatooine?
1727220	1731060	Tala brings them into the Jedi Underground Railroad where, stupidly, everybody who's
1731060	1733060	passed through here has written their name on the wall.
1733060	1735060	Why would you let anybody do this?
1735060	1738860	If this place is ever discovered, the Empire now has a record of everybody who survived
1738860	1741380	Order 66 and they'll be keeping an eye out for them.
1741380	1745820	But there's no way that'll ever happen.
1745820	1749740	Also, how many times are we going to get an origin story for the Rebel Alliance starbird
1749740	1750740	symbol?
1750980	1753900	It was the family crest of the noble house of Merrick, which featured prominently in
1753900	1755020	The Force Unleashed.
1755020	1757940	That whole storyline has been thrown into the Legends shitter, though, and replaced
1757940	1763340	with this purple-haired chick who is a Mandalorian graffiti artist who started painting phoenixes
1763340	1765540	on TIE fighters as a way of fighting the power.
1765540	1767660	Also, maybe this dude from Rogue One did it.
1767660	1772020	The wiki's not exactly clear, but the Kenobi show implies that it was actually started
1772020	1775620	as an adaptation of the symbol of the Order of the Jedi, which was a lightsaber with wings.
1775620	1779580	And after the path turned into the Rebellion, they kept an altered version of that symbol.
1779580	1783980	In fact, it looks kind of like it fell prey to the corporate dumbing down of symbols,
1783980	1785740	making it look all sleek and simplistic.
1794300	1795580	Uh, you need to run.
1799900	1801740	Run Obi-Wan, he can sense you.
1801740	1805300	Obi-Wan, you're in the safehouse of the Underground Railroad and you're lit up like
1805300	1807220	a forced Christmas tree, run.
1807260	1811140	Obi-Wan stays behind to give Leia time to get the safety, but then Tala sends Leia ahead
1811140	1812540	to go back for Obi-Wan.
1812540	1815540	Everyone's just self-sacrificing all over the place, sending the little girl off on
1815540	1817220	her own hoping that she'll make it.
1817220	1818220	And she doesn't.
1818220	1819220	Wait.
1819220	1820220	How did Riva get ahead of her?
1820220	1822280	Riva enters the tunnel that Leia goes down.
1822280	1823660	How did she beat her there?
1823660	1826060	Okay, let's assume that the tunnel has a branching path.
1826060	1830140	That's the path that Obi-Wan and Tala go to attend the obligatory Vader confrontation.
1830140	1834240	Leia's still ahead of Riva, so for Riva to get ahead of Leia, Leia has to double back,
1834240	1837600	go down the other path, let Riva get ahead and then double back again.
1837600	1842440	Or alternatively, it's just a giant labyrinth down there and therefore it was wildly irresponsible
1842440	1843800	to let Leia go off on her own.
1864240	1870480	Okay, okay, I get it, Obi-Wan's terrified.
1870480	1872920	He's not ready to face Anakin again.
1872920	1876800	But the way they shot and cut that scene is like he ran behind a pile of gravel and then
1876800	1877960	came back out the same way.
1877960	1880380	Like oops, I dropped my keys back there or something.
1880380	1881960	The duel between them is kind of lame.
1881960	1884080	Shadaversi does a great job breaking down this fight and many others.
1884080	1885240	She should go check that shit out.
1885240	1888060	But there's a point in this fight where we just break one of the most fundamental Star
1888060	1889060	Wars rules.
1889060	1891600	Anakin uses the force on Obi-Wan during a duel.
1891600	1895320	Now this has never been directly confirmed except in, you know, video games where the
1895320	1898120	game prevents you from doing this exact thing for this exact reason.
1898120	1901800	But it's always been under everyone's impression that Jedis and Siths didn't use the force
1901800	1904120	on each other directly because it would just be a waste of energy.
1904120	1907480	You'd be able to counteract it, which is why Vader always force chokes at regular people,
1907480	1908480	not Jedi.
1908480	1911000	But I guess that's just not the case anymore, so I don't know.
1911000	1914840	I gotta say, I do like the idea that Vader wants to torture the fuck out of Obi-Wan for
1914840	1918800	revenge and just dunks him in the fire like he's a Dunkaroo cracker going into the plastic
1918800	1919800	cheese sauce.
1919800	1924000	When I left you, I was but a learner, now I am the master.
1924000	1926840	Yeah, when you learned how to burn my fucking arm off.
1926840	1931240	Then Vader extinguishes the flames with the force, which I didn't know was a power but
1931240	1932240	alright.
1932240	1936240	And then Tala saves the day by shooting a random stormtrooper, which isn't shoot Vader,
1936240	1937240	no.
1937240	1938900	Also, Vader doesn't somehow censor there.
1938900	1942320	And everyone reacts like they have no idea where the shot came from despite her using
1942320	1945340	a blaster, even though you can see the bright flash of light from it.
1945340	1949680	So Tala reignites the fire with the blaster, creating an impenetrable barrier between Obi-Wan
1949680	1954200	and the stormtroopers, allowing Tala's loader to scoop Obi-Wan up and carry him to safety.
1954200	1958080	Vader doesn't extinguish the flames again, the stormtroopers don't, you know, walk around
1958080	1960440	the huge blaze, nope, nothing.
1960440	1964560	Obi-Wan just gets away, because fuck it, I guess we're not even trying anymore.
1964560	1968920	Episode 4 opens with Obi-Wan getting dunked into the bacta tank at the rebel base on Jabiim,
1968920	1973300	where we see his hallucinations about Anakin, intercut with Anakin himself, also in a bacta
1973300	1974300	tank.
1974300	1977880	I guess he has to sit in one because of his burns, which is a nice touch, um, thematically
1977880	1978880	I mean.
1979080	1982560	Meanwhile, Leia is held captive at the fortress inquisitorious, which is first shown in the
1982560	1987680	video game Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order, which, by the way, had a much hotter sister inquisitor
1987680	1988680	villain.
1988680	1990720	I guess that's why she's the second sister in Riva's the Third.
1990720	1995040	Almost immediately during the interrogation, Leia spills the beans.
1995040	1998640	The Empire doesn't take kindly to Jedi sympathizers.
1998640	2000240	He will come for me.
2000240	2003520	Yep, no plausible deniability, just Obi-Wan will come for me.
2003520	2005260	That's it, that's the end of the Organas.
2005260	2007880	The Empire should just liquidate the entire family at this point.
2007880	2011560	And yeah, I know, Riva's actually got ulterior motives, but how about these guys?
2011560	2015160	Do you think they're not going to tell their superiors about the link between Leia and
2015160	2018280	Obi-Wan after Riva goes off the Imperial Plantation?
2018280	2021080	How in the fuck did Leia ever become a senator after this?
2021080	2023360	Wait a minute, why did Leia become a senator?
2023360	2026700	Surely that kind of job would have brought her in contact with Vader and Palpatine plenty
2026700	2027700	of times.
2027700	2032080	Wasn't the whole point that the Sith could sense the kids, so they needed to be in isolation?
2032080	2036180	Hidden, safe, the children must be kept.
2036180	2039900	We must take them somewhere where the Sith will not sense their presence.
2039900	2042180	How did Vader not sense her on the Death Star?
2042180	2045940	Once Obi-Wan wakes up, he talks to the local leader of the Rebellion in order to try and
2045940	2047600	get some help retrieving Leia.
2047600	2049820	Which is when Tala drops this bomb.
2049820	2053940	She knows everything, where we are, what we're doing.
2053940	2054940	Why?
2054940	2059340	Why would you entrust a ten year old kid with all of your plans like... wait, when did you
2059340	2060340	entrust her?
2060340	2061340	Was it this scene?
2061340	2063940	We have safe houses like this throughout the galaxy.
2063940	2066180	It all leads to Jabin.
2066180	2069060	From there we give them new identities and get them out.
2069060	2070860	Does it look like Leia is listening?
2070860	2073100	I don't know anything about a path.
2073100	2075820	That's actually true, Leia knows literally nothing.
2075820	2078900	Actually this whole scene, every single line, is a bomb.
2078900	2081540	You've no idea what the Empire is capable of.
2081540	2085900	These people have been fighting for years, you've been in a fucking cave this whole time,
2085900	2086900	what do you know?
2086900	2089860	But this comment prompts the leader to give an emotionally hollow speech about his dead
2089860	2090860	wife.
2090860	2092860	I had a wife once.
2092860	2096500	So I know exactly what the Empire can do.
2096500	2100580	This guy, he goes from not helping to helping in the span of about 30 seconds.
2100580	2102700	I'm sorry, but that's not my problem.
2102700	2105460	Look, if you want my help, you got it.
2105460	2110020	In fact he talks himself into it with the dead wife speech, it's not like Obi-Wan convinces
2110020	2111020	him.
2111020	2114420	So they begin to plan the assault of the fortress inquisitorious, and I swear this episode is
2114420	2115980	the worst of the bunch.
2115980	2116980	Listen in here.
2116980	2117980	I don't see any shields.
2117980	2120360	That's because no one would be stupid enough to attack me.
2120360	2121460	How does that make any sense?
2121460	2123780	Isn't that the opposite of how it works?
2123780	2126740	People would be too smart to attack if it was too heavily fortified?
2126740	2130500	But wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, five years earlier in the timeline, during
2130500	2135540	Jedi Fallen Order, a game which everybody, Disney, EA, went to great lengths to ensure
2135540	2140820	is actually canon, Cal Kestis goes to the fortress inquisitorious in the exact same
2140820	2145940	way that Obi-Wan does, but this time it has shields that need to be taken down.
2145940	2148620	I've disabled the shields on the outer sections of the fortress.
2148620	2150220	I don't see any shields.
2150220	2152440	That's because no one would be stupid enough to attack me.
2152440	2155860	With the defenses they got, our usual tricks just aren't going to cut it.
2155860	2157460	I don't see any shields.
2157460	2159860	That's because no one would be stupid enough to attack me.
2159860	2161100	It's impenetrable, Wade.
2161100	2162700	I don't see any shields.
2162700	2165020	That's because no one would be stupid enough to attack me.
2165020	2170460	Somehow, some fucking how, Tala's cover is still intact, even though she, you know, gunned
2170460	2175120	down her own squad at Imperial checkpoint, and the Empire was there that same evening
2175120	2176120	investigating the planet.
2176120	2177980	I guess they just missed that.
2177980	2196660	I know that when most people watch this scene, their knee-jerk response is to say that her
2196660	2201140	bullshitting and rank pulling wouldn't work, because people do have assigned posts, and
2201140	2204560	you can't just bull your way through somebody else's command, especially in a sensitive
2204560	2208180	area like this, which are all things that you would know if you talked to anybody with
2208180	2209800	any military experience.
2209800	2214320	But to me, the more pressing problem is that when he stuck her ID rod into the computer,
2214320	2218900	a big flashing screen should have popped up telling him that her own squad was found dead
2218900	2223940	and she was missing on a planet where Obi-Wan and Leia were sighted dealing with the Rebels.
2223940	2226540	The exact same Leia that's in their basement now.
2226540	2231260	And so begins the worst infiltration in probably all of cinema history.
2231260	2235540	Palla is just hanging out around other Imperials, openly talking to Obi-Wan on the mic.
2235540	2239740	In fact, this guy even notices her, and he's like, yeah, that's kind of weird, but it's
2239740	2240980	almost time for my break.
2240980	2245280	She is, of course, discovered, upon which she goes with the officer behind a large computer
2245280	2250320	in the same room and knocks him out, again, in the same room that all the other officers
2250320	2251320	are doing their work in.
2251320	2253040	Do these guys just not hear what's going on?
2253040	2257280	Do they not think it's weird she just comes back after getting told to report to security?
2257300	2260020	This is some Metal Gear Solid level of hide-the-guard shit.
2275720	2279480	At the deepest level of the fortress, down where Riva is torturing Leia, put a big pin
2279480	2283020	in that, we'll get back to it, Obi-Wan discovers the big secret of the facility.
2283020	2286460	It's actually a tomb for all the dead Jedi from Order 66.
2286640	2289040	At least, that's what Obi-Wan assumes it is.
2289040	2291800	But if it is a tomb, why does it look like they're frozen in place from the moment they
2291800	2292800	died?
2292800	2293800	Like, look at this kid.
2293800	2295680	It looks like he's been time-stopped right when he got shot.
2295680	2299480	The cynical part of me wants to say that Disney is going to come out in some future show and
2299480	2302520	say, oh, those guys down there weren't dead, they were just in stasis.
2302520	2306080	That's why they all look like that, and that's how they can bring back any character they
2306080	2307080	want.
2307080	2308080	You want a Mace Windu show?
2308080	2309080	It's okay, they put them back together after the fall.
2309080	2310720	You want an Aayla Secura show?
2310720	2311900	Everyone likes blue girls.
2311900	2313280	You want a Kit Fisto show?
2313280	2315040	With a name like that, pair them with Aayla.
2315040	2318260	So these guys can't be in stasis, can they?
2318260	2320580	That was the whole point of carbonite freezing in Empire.
2320580	2324060	Nobody had developed the technology to put people into stasis yet, or at least technology
2324060	2325620	that would reliably work on a Jedi.
2325620	2330000	The whole middle arc of Empire, on the Imperial side anyway, was Vader trying to find a way
2330000	2334620	to incapacitate Luke, and he finally settled on jerry-rigging Lando's gas-refining equipment.
2334620	2336540	We only use this facility for carbon freezing.
2336540	2338020	You put him in there, it might kill him.
2338020	2340620	I do not want the Emperor's prize damaged.
2340620	2344220	We will test it on Captain Solo.
2344220	2349440	The only logical conclusion is that this place is as Obi-Wan said.
2349440	2352560	But if that's the case, then this scene serves no purpose in the show.
2352560	2354240	They don't come back here and do anything.
2354240	2355440	This information never comes up again.
2355440	2359520	If it's meant to show how bad the Empire is that they're turning Jedi corpses into
2359520	2361720	trophies, I mean, yeah, alright.
2361720	2367640	But at this point we all already know how bad the Empire is.
2367640	2368640	Yes we do, Obi-Wan.
2368640	2369840	We always have.
2369840	2374540	The scene where Obi-Wan solid snakes into the torture chamber and saves Leia is actually
2374540	2375540	great.
2375540	2379460	The idea of a Jedi using darkness to his advantage by turning off his lightsaber so you can't
2379460	2380460	see him.
2380460	2381460	You haven't seen that before and I kinda like it.
2381460	2383900	Hey, shouldn't our helmets have night vi- ahhhh!
2383900	2387660	Meanwhile, Talib breaks free from her stormtrooper guard, yeah she got caught and brought to
2387660	2390740	security a second time, by slapping him in the face.
2390740	2391820	Yes, really.
2391820	2395620	At this point, stormtrooper armor seems to make people less defended when they put it
2395620	2396620	on.
2396620	2399320	Obi-Wan's first card, getting the Darth Maul treatment, is the second most notorious
2399320	2400580	action scene in Kenobi.
2400580	2401820	This one is the first.
2401820	2406240	As Obi-Wan and Leia escape, he accidentally deflects a blaster bolt into the pressurized
2406240	2409480	glass, causing the weight of the ocean to breach into the hallway.
2409480	2413560	Obi-Wan tells Tala to take Leia and escape while he uses his force powers to hold the
2413560	2414560	water back.
2414560	2418160	And the show presents this like it's a great magical moment, like this is when Obi-Wan
2418160	2420000	finally gets his force mojo back.
2420000	2423400	In fact, they even set it up earlier in the episode, where Obi-Wan is struggling to spin
2423400	2427540	a fidget spinner using the force, and Tala is like, you've got PTSD.
2427540	2430980	Like this hallway scene is the big moment where Obi-Wan re-communes with the force,
2430980	2432480	but we already had this moment.
2432480	2434980	We had it when Obi-Wan catches Leia on Daewoo.
2434980	2439780	Their final plan is to justâ€¦ walk right through the crowd, with Leia underneath Obi-Wan's
2439780	2440780	coat.
2440780	2444500	I've seen soy boys online defend this scene, saying that Star Wars should have comedy,
2444500	2445980	and yes I completely agree.
2445980	2450220	C-3PO, R2-D2, Chewie, Anakin's banter in the same movie he becomes one of cinema's
2450220	2451220	greatest villains.
2452220	2459440	Even the more questionable choices like the Ewoks or Jar Jar, fine, Star Wars should have
2459440	2460520	moments of comedy.
2460520	2465100	But just as this scene or this scene or this scene shouldn't be a moment of comedy, neither
2465100	2466380	should this scene.
2466380	2470800	In fact, one of the main reasons that this show rapes the old lore is because it actually
2470800	2474980	turns this scene into a farce with Leia's complete non-reaction.
2474980	2480080	You have to have a specific type of anti-talent to ruin genuinely good movies and turn serious
2480080	2483200	scenes into comedic scenes with your new incompetent additions.
2483200	2486440	Like I don't even know if I can overstate just how stupid this is, and the show just
2486440	2487440	lets it happen.
2487440	2488440	No one's blinking an eye.
2488440	2492120	For some reason, nobody can tell that Obi-Wan's coat is a fucking circus tent.
2492120	2494000	Nobody's stopping them, they just waltz right out into the hangar.
2494000	2498400	General Obi-Wan Kenobi, years ago you snuggled me out of the Imperial base underneath your
2498400	2499400	trench coat.
2499400	2503600	In fact, even after Riva actually stops them, people are still going about their business.
2503600	2504600	Guys, do you mind?
2504600	2505760	We're trying to do a scene here.
2505760	2508200	The Rebels show up in two snowspeeders to pick them up.
2508200	2510840	One speeder occupies Riva, while the other picks up the gang.
2510840	2513320	I guess all three of them fit into the back of a speeder now?
2513320	2515560	Y'all know those things only hold two people, right?
2515560	2516560	One pilot, one gunner?
2516560	2519880	Did Obi-Wan, Leia, and Tala just cram themselves in the back?
2519880	2522400	Is Leia's face squished up against the glass?
2522400	2525380	They never show them getting in it, so I guess we're just not supposed to think about it.
2525380	2530840	After the tragic death of Wade, oh no, that guy.
2530840	2534040	I guess he's wading in the ocean now.
2534040	2536120	They return back home to the Rebel base.
2536120	2537120	Wait a second, though.
2537120	2539320	The fortress Inquisitorius is on the planet Nur.
2539320	2540760	Nur is a water world.
2540760	2542000	It's a moon of Mustafar.
2542000	2545040	Mustafar is the infamous lava planet where Anakin got barbecued.
2545040	2548380	But more importantly, at this point, it's the place where Darth Vader has built his
2548380	2551680	upstate cottage, for when he needs a getaway from the everyday life of running the Empire.
2551680	2555760	Yes, I know, it's symbolic, because Vader's emotionally stuck at the point where he lost
2555760	2558440	everything and now he's also physically stuck there, too.
2558440	2559440	Fine, fine.
2559440	2563920	But how in the holy hell do the Rebels even get into Darth Vader's personal star system
2563920	2564920	without getting noticed?
2564920	2565920	It's in the Mustafar system.
2566920	2571400	Why isn't there star destroyers or something in orbit around both Vader's castle and the
2571400	2572600	fortress Inquisitorius?
2572600	2573600	And how did the Rebels get away?
2573600	2575400	Why didn't they scramble ships?
2575400	2579700	Even if there's, somehow, nobody in orbit, you've got ships in the hangar.
2579700	2582600	Episode 5 opens with a tribute to Wade, our fallen comrade.
2582600	2586600	All right, right behind you.
2586600	2587600	Wade!
2587600	2590880	I'm actually surprised they remembered to put him in the recap.
2590880	2593920	I figured something that sullen would have weighed the episode down.
2593920	2594920	Okay, I'm done.
2594920	2595920	I'm done.
2595920	2596920	That's the last one.
2596920	2599920	This episode is interspersed with flashbacks to Attack of the Clones, from when Anakin
2599920	2602960	was a Padawan and Obi-Wan was still training him in how to fight.
2602960	2604760	Using real lightsabers, though, for some reason.
2604760	2608240	And it looks like they kinda de-aged Hayden Christensen.
2608240	2609240	Not really, you know.
2609240	2612700	It looks like they cast a 40-year-old man to play a 20-year-old and used the latest
2612700	2615320	technology to de-age him to about 35.
2615320	2619080	In fact, we know this could have been done better because somebody did do it better.
2619080	2620080	Look at these two scenes.
2620080	2623280	Disney, how do you fuck up turning on a Snapchat filter?
2623280	2627600	Flash forward to the present day, where it turns out that Riva is being made Grand Inquisitor
2627600	2628880	because of her cunning plan.
2628880	2632540	You see, it was all a ploy on her part that Obi-Wan would escape, because she put a tracker
2632540	2636440	on him, and now they'll lead the Empire back to the Rebel base, where a hacked Lola
2636440	2638040	will disable their defenses from the inside.
2638040	2641920	A plan which requires Lola to have the ability to open a maintenance hatch without touching
2641920	2642920	it.
2642920	2643920	Must be some pretty strong magnets in there.
2643920	2648200	The tracker and hacker on Lola, by the way, is one of those restraining bolts that we've
2648200	2649200	seen previously.
2649200	2653100	In A New Hope, it didn't actually alter the personalities of R2-D2 or C-3PO.
2653100	2655580	It just let them be immobilized by a remote control.
2655580	2658460	But okay, let's assume that Lola's been turned evil by a restraining bolt.
2658460	2661660	Oh, if only you had noticed the Terminator eye sooner, Leia.
2661660	2662660	Wait a minute!
2662660	2664520	How did Leia even get Lola back?
2664520	2668220	Lola tried to attack Riva with her micro saw blade during the interrogation scene.
2668220	2670020	That's pretty dangerous for a kid's toy, by the way.
2670020	2674900	But Riva easily subdued Lola with the Force, and immediately after took Leia to the torture
2674900	2675900	chamber.
2675900	2679000	Riva was called away by Talos' distraction, and that's when Obi-Wan does the splinter
2679000	2680340	cell thing to rescue her.
2680340	2684620	At this point, the only other time Riva and Leia are even in the same room is during the
2684620	2686460	escape, where Riva is a bit preoccupied.
2686460	2690660	And it's not like anybody else knew to give the droid back to her, because Vader and the
2690660	2694860	other Inquisitors are royally pissed off until Riva explains her gambit.
2694860	2696380	And yet, Leia's got Lola.
2696380	2700860	Either Lola flew out of Riva's pocket into the speeder on her own, off screen, or were
2700860	2705420	being asked to believe that Riva, in between the interrogation scene where she first grabbed
2705420	2709300	Lola, and the immediate march down to the torture chamber, took a side detour to mess
2709340	2712460	with the droid and then give it back to Leia, also off screen.
2712460	2716620	Disney didn't rate this show with the intention that your brain be engaged while watching
2716620	2717620	it.
2717620	2720360	But all the Defenders online are saying, hey, you see, this show is smart.
2720360	2723420	This explains how Leia knew they were being tracked in Episode 4.
2723420	2724420	They let us go.
2724420	2727180	It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape.
2727180	2728180	Easy.
2728180	2729180	You call that easy?
2729180	2730180	They're tracking us.
2730180	2733060	It happened to Leia as a kid, so she can see it coming as an adult.
2733060	2734060	Smart writing.
2734060	2737460	Except it's not, because this makes Obi-Wan look like a complete fucking buffoon.
2737620	2741580	Obi-Wan did the very same thing to Jango Fett in Attack of the Clones.
2741580	2744140	Why didn't he see it coming, then, like Leia did?
2744140	2747160	Lola's there, I guess, and transmitting information back to the Empire.
2747160	2750860	The Rebels are planning to evacuate, because, you know, the Imperials are closing in.
2750860	2755540	The reason that the Anakin-Obi-Wan training flashback is even in this episode is so that
2755540	2759580	Obi-Wan can reflect on Anakin's fighting style and use that knowledge to make this
2759580	2760580	remark.
2760580	2761580	He'll attack next.
2761580	2762900	He has the patience for siege.
2762900	2764060	Okay, fair enough.
2764060	2768180	But this turns out to be a completely irrelevant insight, because the Empire could just bomb
2768180	2769180	them from orbit.
2769180	2773060	And I don't know why they don't, because their only objective is to kill everyone there.
2773060	2777120	Instead, they opt to send troops down with a huge gun, which ends up being completely
2777120	2778760	useless against the blast doors.
2778760	2782900	It's okay, though, because the blast doors get instantly shredded by Riva's lightsaber
2782900	2783900	anyway.
2783900	2786660	I guess patience for a siege wasn't necessary after all, eh, Obi-Wan?
2786660	2792240	Hey, remember when it took Qui-Gon Jinn several minutes of stern concentration with his lightsaber
2792240	2794680	to be able to melt a hole on a blast door?
2794680	2799400	Meanwhile, Bail Organa sends a completely unnecessary, traceable, and highly sensitive
2799400	2802440	message to Obi-Wan during the midst of all this, where he says,
2802440	2807440	I know he said no communication, but your silence worries me.
2807440	2814840	If he's found you, if he's learned of the children, if I don't hear from you soon, I'll
2814840	2815840	head to Tatooine.
2815840	2818640	Owen will need help with the boy.
2818640	2819840	Oh, smart, dude.
2819840	2821560	The fucking brain's on this guy.
2821560	2825600	I think you've been found, so I'm going to send this message with secret info in it to
2825600	2826600	you, Obi-Wan.
2826600	2829400	Let's hope the Empire doesn't find it all.
2829400	2833480	Immediately after this, Tala gives her Death Flag speech, and then Obi-Wan goes to the
2833480	2837640	blast doors to buy the others time to escape, and to confront Riva, who also gives her Death
2837640	2848560	Flag speech.
2848560	2852520	The ensuing fight consists of stormtroopers pouring into the breach made by Riva's lightsaber,
2852520	2854480	all of them missing every single shot.
2854480	2858260	Okay, so I know you're stormtroopers, but Obi-Wan's the only target for a solid 10 seconds.
2858260	2859260	How are you guys missing?
2859260	2860260	Look at this dude.
2860260	2861260	Where are you shooting?
2861260	2862260	Obi-Wan is right there.
2862260	2863260	What are you aiming at?
2863260	2867780	Also, at this point, Disney has retconned the Force, such that we know a Jedi can stop
2867780	2870940	blaster bolts in mid-air without having to deflect anything.
2870940	2873400	Why doesn't Obi-Wan just pull a Neo and hold them back?
2873400	2876800	I mean, we are going to see him do something equivalent by the end of the series, so why
2876800	2877800	the fuck not?
2878040	2881600	The fight is ended by Tala, who sacrifices herself by way of a thermal detonator.
2881600	2885480	I don't know why she didn't just throw it, it's a grenade, she probably could have survived,
2885480	2887520	but I guess Disney is hoping that you'll care.
2887520	2890120	So the breach is sealed by Tala's sacrifice.
2890120	2893840	Wait, not really, because Obi-Wan just walks back 15 seconds later.
2893840	2895360	So why did this explosion stop the fighting?
2895360	2898400	Yeah, it killed a bunch of people, but it didn't close the hole through the blast door,
2898400	2901480	and there's clearly more stormtroopers, and you know what, whatever, I don't care anymore.
2901480	2905360	Obi-Wan decides to go right back out there to sacrifice himself again, that's two times
2905360	2909360	now in the span of two minutes, where he has another sensitive conversation out in
2909360	2912800	the open, this time with Riva about her secret plan to kill Darth Vader.
2912800	2918480	You're not bringing him to me, I'm bringing him to you.
2918480	2920680	Jesus Christ, this time they're both retarded.
2920680	2924200	Dude, the stormtroopers are right there, do you think they don't hear you plotting the
2924200	2926280	assassination of Darth fucking Vader?
2926280	2929960	And it's at this point that Riva unveils her grand plan.
2929960	2933780	Okay so let me lay this out for you, you're going to want to get a drink for this.
2933940	2938460	Riva is apparently one of the many Jedi who survived Order 66 as a youngling, right?
2938460	2941480	Afterward she devoted herself to hunting and killing Darth Vader.
2941480	2944220	Her plan was to become an Inquisitor, get close to Vader, and then knife him in the
2944220	2945220	back.
2945220	2948820	At the start of the series we're told that Riva has a weird obsession with finding Obi-Wan
2948820	2949820	Kenobi.
2949820	2952920	Everyone else has given up the hunt and they find Riva's obsession to be a bit off-putting.
2952920	2954740	Great way for her to blow her cover, but whatever.
2954740	2958420	Riva's plan is to, okay I gotta keep it together here.
2958420	2964420	Riva's plan is to hire drug dealers on the slum planet of Diu to fly to Alderaan, a prosperous
2964420	2969920	core world, bypass all of their security, kidnap Princess Leia, daughter of an Imperial
2969920	2971420	Senator and the Queen of the planet.
2971420	2974260	Wait a second, I thought Leia was a princess because Padme was Queen of Naboo.
2974260	2977020	Oh but I guess that had to be kept secret because nobody's supposed to know about
2977020	2978180	the Leia-Padme connection.
2978180	2982540	In retrospect it kind of feels like in episode 1 the only reason Padme is a queen is to hint
2982540	2986420	at the future relationship with Anakin where their daughter turns out to be a princess.
2986420	2989860	But by episode 3 George Lucas realized this was supposed to be a secret so I guess she's
2989860	2991620	got two queen mothers now.
2991620	2994180	Jesus the fuckery that is Star Wars is getting to me.
2994180	2998620	Riva's plan, okay hire the Diu drug dealers to kidnap Leia off the heavily fortified world
2998620	2999620	of Alderaan.
2999620	3003940	Then she hopes that Bail Organa calls up Obi-Wan for help rather than using any of his other
3003940	3005360	resources at his disposal.
3005360	3010540	Because according to the fabled archive files Bail Organa knows where Obi-Wan is and rather
3010540	3014660	than just extract that information out of him Riva would rather Obi-Wan resurface on
3014660	3015660	his own.
3015900	3017700	If Obi-Wan takes the bait Riva will apprehend him.
3017700	3020080	Or at least that's what she tells the other Inquisitors.
3020080	3025180	Her actual plan, her actual plan is to get Obi-Wan in front of Vader so that he will
3025180	3027300	be distracted enough that she can kill him.
3027300	3031620	And when the first attempt to do that plan fails on Diu the second plan is to just do
3031620	3034580	the exact same thing again at the fortress Inquisitorius.
3034580	3038700	And when that plan fails the third plan is to do the exact same thing again at the Rebel
3038700	3039700	base.
3039700	3042820	Only this time the plan really fails because Darth Vader is fucking Darth Vader.
3045660	3053540	He was wise to use you against me.
3053540	3054540	Yeah that.
3054540	3058900	So Leia fixes the hangar doors in time, Obi-Wan slips away from the stormtroopers, Haja accidentally
3058900	3061580	drops Obi-Wan's secret message from Bail Organa.
3061580	3064620	Yeah Haja is here too when he had the message, don't worry it's really not important.
3064620	3066660	And everybody piles into the transport ready to go.
3066660	3070180	Vader arrives just in time to pull the transport back with the force.
3070180	3074920	And it's at this point everybody and I mean everybody gave up on this fucking show.
3074960	3079240	If this is what the force can do now, why does Vader even bother with the lightsaber
3079240	3080240	shit?
3080240	3082640	Why doesn't he just pop people's heads like that one chick from the boys?
3082640	3086520	When he had Obi-Wan strung up why not just immediately dismember him?
3086520	3087520	Fuck it.
3087520	3090160	Why didn't Vader just slam Luke into the carbonite freezer?
3090160	3094120	Hell why didn't Vader hold back the Millennium Falcon, an empire?
3094120	3097260	When the force is this strong it breaks the fucking canon.
3097260	3100920	People were complaining about Starkiller pulling star destroyers out of orbit and force unleashed
3100920	3101920	back in the day.
3101920	3106920	And rightfully so, they made that game non-canon, but they brought back its most egregious component
3106920	3108680	because fuck me I guess.
3108680	3112680	But it's all okay because it was a fake ship and the real one gets away immediately
3112680	3113680	after.
3113680	3115160	Why doesn't Vader just hold back that one too?
3115160	3117180	This is the same problem with that fire extinguisher scene.
3117180	3121160	They establish a rule, an expectation in the viewer's mind of what can be done.
3121160	3124860	And then they immediately violate it in the same scene because they've written themselves
3124860	3125860	into a corner.
3125860	3128280	Also, how did the Rebels know that Vader would do that?
3128280	3132880	Is that another one of Obi-Wan's off-screen nuggets of wisdom based on Vader's personality?
3132880	3136540	Or maybe Obi-Wan went on that When Disney World ride where Vader holds a ship back so
3136540	3137540	he knows what's coming.
3137540	3139640	Also, where is that second ship?
3139640	3142760	Seriously you can't see it when the first ship flies off.
3142760	3143760	Is it this?
3143760	3145520	This blurry blob deep in the background?
3145520	3146920	Is that the ship they're all on?
3146920	3148560	It's a hell of a lot bigger when it takes off.
3148560	3150920	Also, there's a star destroyer in orbit.
3150920	3155200	I hope they don't just let the ship get away again like on Dayu to the mining planet
3155200	3158560	or the mining planet to the rebel base or leaving the fortress inquisitorious.
3158560	3162120	It really feels like the Empire is severely undermanned in this show.
3162120	3165460	Like they've got maybe a couple dozen guys at best to do all of this shit.
3165460	3168560	The confrontation between Riva and Vader is actually really interesting.
3168560	3172400	Where Riva is just hopelessly outmatched to the point that Vader doesn't even draw his
3172400	3173400	lightsaber.
3173400	3175360	He simply blocks her attacks with the force.
3175360	3177720	It's a new way of fighting we haven't really seen before in Star Wars.
3177720	3178920	It almost feels like martial arts.
3178920	3183320	But then the fight immediately dive bombs into what I can only describe as a Dark Souls
3183320	3184320	role fight.
3184440	3187140	Seriously, that's the only way to describe what Riva is doing here.
3187140	3190840	Was the original plan for Riva to do some kind of Capoeira shit and the actress just
3190840	3193520	couldn't pull the moves off so it came out looking like this?
3193520	3195260	Why would you leave this farce in?
3195260	3197280	Of course, the Grand Inquisitor is still alive.
3197280	3200160	He survived getting stabbed in the gut just like Riva did as a child.
3200160	3202880	Oh, and just like Riva did again as an adult.
3202880	3205100	How many stomachs does Riva have, guys?
3205100	3207440	And of course, they just leave her to bleed out.
3207440	3209960	Riva manages to find the message that Haja dropped.
3209960	3212800	It's damaged, but she fixes it enough to hear part of the message.
3214360	3217960	If you've learned of the children, I'll hand them Tatooine.
3220280	3222760	Owen, help the boy.
3224760	3228280	Because Riva had that run-in with Uncle Owen in the first episode, when she hears that
3228280	3232340	message that Bail Organa totally should not have sent, she recognizes that there's some
3232340	3236160	sort of connection between Owen, specifically his son, and the Organa family.
3236160	3240280	So she somehow manages to make her way to Tatooine, while wounded, and without any sort
3240280	3241280	of interstellar transport.
3241280	3242280	The Rebels have already left.
3242280	3243280	The Imperials are gone.
3243280	3244680	How the hell did she get off this rock?
3244680	3245680	Are you okay?
3245680	3247560	I just sensed a plot hole.
3247560	3251400	Word gets back to Uncle Owen that an Inquisitor is coming, and the Lars family decides the
3251400	3254520	best course of action isn't to skip town, go lay low.
3254520	3256880	No, Aunt Beru wants to stand and fight.
3256880	3257880	We need to leave, Beru.
3257880	3259880	We need to take Luke and hide somewhere.
3259880	3260880	Where?
3260880	3261880	In the desert?
3261880	3263280	I'm not leaving my home.
3263280	3264800	At least here we have a chance.
3264800	3269000	Remember, these guys don't know that Riva is injured and working alone and without the
3269000	3271160	institutional backing of the Imperial State.
3271160	3274040	Also, they know they're holding onto a child of destiny.
3274040	3276800	I know it's stupid, but the show's acting this way, so let's just roll with it at this
3276800	3277800	point.
3277800	3278880	So surely they must have a plan.
3278880	3280760	If the Empire ever came knocking.
3280760	3283280	But nope, the plan is just castle doctrine.
3283280	3285800	Get some rifles and fight them off from inside your own house.
3285800	3287560	These people are fucking stupid.
3287560	3291960	I expected this show to rape and butcher the characters of Obi-Wan and Darth Vader, but
3291960	3293520	not Aunt fucking Beru.
3293520	3297040	Obi-Wan stays behind to sacrifice himself and let the Rebels get away again.
3297040	3299120	But this time, the gambit shouldn't work.
3299120	3301720	The Empire is pursuing the Rebel ship and a Star Destroyer.
3301720	3305340	You have more than enough resources to split them here and pursue both.
3305340	3308440	My lord, we must continue our pursuit of the insurgents.
3308440	3314320	Now is our chance to wipe out this network in its entirety.
3314320	3318480	We cannot prioritize one lone Jedi.
3318480	3322680	He is not just any Jedi.
3322680	3323680	Follow Kenobi.
3323680	3326000	At once, Lord Vader.
3326000	3327000	And you know, I get it.
3327000	3330320	You're showing that Vader is obsessed with Obi-Wan and it's blinding him.
3330320	3332840	But look at the Grand Inquisitor's face in this scene.
3332840	3336560	This is the look you make when you know that your boss just made the biggest mistake of
3336560	3337560	his career.
3337560	3339720	But you can't say anything because if you do, he'll fire you.
3339720	3344100	It doesn't even make sense because when they arrive at the obligatory deserted dueling
3344100	3346560	planet, Vader takes his personal shuttle down.
3346560	3349140	These shuttles are capable of going into hyperdrive.
3349140	3352840	There's no reason Vader couldn't have taken his shuttle to pursue Obi-Wan and left the
3352840	3360700	pursuit of the rebels in the hands of the Grand Inquisitor on the Star Destroyer.
3360700	3363720	Have you come to destroy me, Obi-Wan?
3363720	3365480	Dude, you followed me here.
3365480	3368520	Yeah, we're heading into the confrontation with Vader, which I know this show's been
3368520	3369520	building up to.
3369520	3373160	But it kind of deflates the emotional impact of their reuniting in A New Hope, doesn't
3373160	3374160	it?
3374160	3375160	I sense something.
3375160	3379480	A presence I've not felt since Obi-Wan blasted my mask off nine years ago.
3379480	3383200	And so begins the culmination of the emotional arc of the entire season, where Obi-Wan has
3383200	3387120	faced his fears, he's got his mojo back, and he's ready to finally confront Vader.
3387120	3388520	The fight is, again, actually pretty good.
3388520	3408320	The music is even okay.
3408320	3411600	So I have no idea why they didn't use Battle of the Heroes for Episode 3.
3411600	3413560	The callback would be incredible, wouldn't it?
3413560	3438240	Like here, just check out the same scene with Episode 3's music.
3438400	3439400	Isn't that fucking incredible?
3439400	3443600	While all this is going on, Riva sneaks onto the Lars homestead under the cover of darkness,
3443600	3446600	and immediately reveals herself by igniting her lightsaber.
3446600	3449900	Uncle Owen, now knowing where she is, takes a shot.
3449900	3450900	And misses.
3450900	3452900	Jesus, what a comedy of errors.
3452900	3464600	Uncle Owen does get one badass moment, though, with this exchange with Riva.
3464600	3466160	You know, gotta hand it to the guy.
3466160	3467920	He's fighting an Inquisitor with a pipe.
3467920	3472640	But unfortunately for Riva, Luke does what they all should have done hours ago, run into
3472640	3474640	the desert.
3474640	3481120	Meanwhile, back where the audience's focus and care actually resides, the Obi-Wan vs
3481120	3482960	Anakin rematch is picking up the pace.
3482960	3484500	A bit too much, actually.
3484500	3488360	That really seems to be what's at the core of the cool-scene-itis problem with Disney's
3488360	3489360	Star Wars.
3489360	3493360	Even when they have a legitimately good idea, they turn it up so much it becomes entirely
3493360	3494360	unbelievable.
3494360	3495360	Check this bit out.
3495360	3500200	Vader force throws a rock into Obi-Wan's leg so hard that the rock shatters and Obi-Wan
3500200	3501200	goes down.
3501200	3503800	Now, Obi-Wan shouldn't be getting up from that.
3503800	3506080	That liquefied his fucking ankle, dude.
3506080	3511680	Vader goes on to bury him in more rocks, while dropping the blandest possible one-liner.
3511680	3515840	You have failed, master.
3515840	3516840	Come on, man.
3516840	3520640	At least say something like, I actually do have the high ground at Obi-Wan, would you
3520640	3521640	look at that?
3521640	3525280	Obi-Wan manages to hold out underneath the rock pile by creepily thinking of Luke and
3525280	3526280	Leia.
3526280	3529080	And this is clearly meant to be the moment where Obi-Wan is inspired by those who he
3529080	3530960	has to protect to get his mojo back.
3530960	3531960	For the 15th time.
3531960	3536320	So Obi-Wan pulls himself out of the hole and oh come the fuck on.
3536320	3540600	Remember when master fucking Yoda had to struggle to move just a few rocks?
3540600	3544100	Remember when lifting an X-wing out of the swamp was considered the maximum extent of
3544100	3545640	force levitation powers?
3545640	3549700	Putting these kind of concrete restrictions on the use of the force makes Jedi more interesting.
3549700	3553660	Because while they can do things others can't and they are extremely special, they're not
3553660	3558020	overpowered, they don't break the story, and therefore even a good Jedi can be overcome
3558020	3559780	if you come at the problem from the right angle.
3559780	3562780	That's the point of the Mandalorians and their anti-Jedi weaponry.
3562780	3566220	That's the point of Order 66 and overwhelming them with sheer numbers.
3566220	3569980	But if Obi-Wan can actually act as a one-man artillery unit, then fuck it dude, just go
3569980	3570980	home.
3570980	3573340	Why didn't he cause the mountain to collapse and all of his clone troopers?
3573340	3576780	Because the prequels, for all of their faults, weren't this stupid.
3576860	3580860	Obi-Wan strikes the decisive blow on Vader's helmet, dramatically revealing his scarred face.
3580860	3584140	His voice in this scene is a mixture of Anakin and Vader's, which is a nice touch.
3584140	3586140	Anakin's gone.
3586140	3591660	I am what remains.
3591660	3595580	The way the shots are framed, where you get that close-up of Anakin's disfigured, vulnerable
3595580	3599980	face beneath the terror-inducing Vader mask, how the scene is only lit by the glow of their
3599980	3604140	lightsabers, how Anakin's face flashes with 50 different emotions after Obi-Wan apologizes
3604140	3605140	to him.
3605140	3606940	Obi-Wan is a money shot at the entire show.
3606940	3609860	Every character moment has pushed Obi-Wan towards letting go of his guilt.
3609860	3617940	And when Obi-Wan says, I'm sorry Anakin, for all of it, he's taking responsibility.
3617940	3621020	Not just for what he did to Anakin in their fight, but for how he failed Anakin, for what
3621020	3622020	Anakin became.
3622020	3625940	Obi-Wan is saying, even for the things that he's not responsible for, he's sorry that
3625940	3627500	things turned out how they did.
3627500	3630860	And Anakin, in a way, absolves him of all that responsibility.
3630860	3635300	That tiny flash of an evil smile shows Obi-Wan that Anakin actually likes who he's become.
3635300	3640060	I am absolutely convinced that this is the scene the writers base this entire show around.
3640060	3641540	The ultimate case of cool-scene-itis.
3641540	3646180	Dude, wouldn't it be fucking cool if Obi-Wan re-encountered Vader and learned just how
3646180	3647180	much of a monster he's become?
3647180	3648400	Yeah, it would be.
3648400	3650480	But you need a narrative that supports that journey.
3650480	3654380	You need a well-crafted story that will pick Obi-Wan up out of the desert where we left
3654380	3658300	him at the end of Episode 3, have that cool scene in a way that doesn't break the lore,
3658300	3661140	and then put him back down where he is in time for Episode 4.
3661140	3662140	And this show?
3662140	3663300	This show ain't that.
3663300	3667140	That's why so many things happen at the end, for absolutely no reason at all, other than
3667140	3670460	the fact that we need to reset the game board in time for a new hope.
3670460	3672140	Obi-Wan has Vader beaten here.
3672140	3673860	It's over, and he just walks away.
3673860	3674860	Why?
3674860	3675860	Why are you leaving?
3675860	3679680	You even admit that Anakin is dead to you now, so why not make him actually dead?
3679680	3684700	At this point, Obi-Wan knows he's seen what kind of monster Vader is, and he still lets
3684700	3685700	him live.
3685700	3688060	To go on to, for example, blow up Alderaan.
3688060	3689940	Yeah, Obi-Wan, those millions of voices?
3689940	3691420	That's your fault now, buddy.
3691420	3694820	You just fucked up the homeworld of that little girl you apparently have a special bond with.
3694820	3695860	But that's okay, right?
3695860	3699060	Now you would think that we would end the show on the resolution of the most important
3699060	3700060	arc.
3700060	3701060	But no.
3701060	3704380	After Vader is beaten, Riva is still playing grab-ass in the desert with Luke.
3704380	3705860	Your father's lightsaber.
3705860	3707540	Yeah, I know.
3707540	3711100	Riva attacked my house ten years ago while you were off on an adventure with my sister.
3711100	3712820	Luke falls or something and gets knocked out.
3712820	3713820	I don't know.
3713820	3716620	I'm writing this part of the script at like 3am and I can't be arsed to go back and
3716620	3717620	check.
3718180	3719540	Riva is only able to catch up and get her revenge.
3719540	3720540	But she can't.
3720540	3722860	She sees herself in Luke and she just can't do it.
3722860	3724700	This is why everyone loves Riva, you guys.
3724700	3725700	She's just confused.
3725700	3728340	She's redeemed because she didn't kill the plot armor character.
3728340	3730140	And that is a load of horseshit.
3730140	3732540	What about all the other people Riva has killed?
3732540	3734700	What about all the other shit she's done over the years?
3734700	3736980	What about one-armed Sally back in Mos Eisley?
3736980	3739100	You think she's ever going to be able to masturbate normally again?
3739100	3742580	Doesn't she have some kind of moral consideration too, even though she's not a main character?
3742580	3743760	Hell, what about Leia?
3743800	3747680	Why wasn't she having PTSD flashbacks preventing her from torturing Leia?
3747680	3750320	It was only getting called away that stopped her in the end.
3750320	3753320	Did she just critically fail her willpower role when it came to Luke?
3753320	3756900	Here's what people don't seem to understand nowadays about a good redemption arc.
3756900	3760980	If Darth Vader had survived the Empire's fall, he would have been put on trial for
3760980	3763320	war crimes, regardless of his redemption.
3763320	3767560	Now if he's actually redeemed, he also would have accepted that fate and gone to his death
3767560	3768560	peacefully.
3768560	3772240	But the point is, suddenly saying, I'm the good guy now, even if you mean it, doesn't
3772240	3773480	absolve you of what you did.
3773480	3776280	That's the beginning point of the journey, not the end.
3776280	3780320	So when Riva walks back to the Owen family home, carrying an unconscious Luke, Obi-Wan
3780320	3783300	â€“ yeah, he made it back to Tatooine just in time for the action, the Star Destroyer
3783300	3786440	in orbit gave him no trouble because of course it didn't â€“ Obi-Wan should immediately
3786440	3790240	stick his lightsaber to her forehead and turn it on, but he doesn't because she's redeemed
3790240	3791780	and she made the right choice.
3791780	3795480	And because, I'm guessing, Disney's hoping to parlay this appearance into a Riva spin-off
3795480	3796480	show.
3796480	3799240	The obligatory reset button scene pretends it's a character moment, but it's not.
3799240	3802320	It's here to restore the status quo and not disrupt the lore.
3802320	3805780	Though considering all the plot holes that is bitched about for over an hour, there's
3805780	3809160	no way one scene will repair all the damage the show has caused.
3809160	3825900	But here is their attempt.
3825900	3829580	Even though it's already common knowledge, among the many stormtroopers and inquisitors
3829580	3833540	who saw it, the story ends with Obi-Wan deciding to move on with his life.
3833540	3837540	Even though we all know that moving on means from moving from a Tatooine cave to a Tatooine
3837540	3838540	hut.
3838540	3842340	Moreover, at this point he should be the most wanted fucking Jedi in the galaxy now that
3842340	3846300	it's confirmed he's still alive, having been a Jedi Master, a General of the Old Republic,
3846300	3849420	his knowledge and dealings with the Rebel Alliance, his knowledge of Darth Vader's
3849420	3853340	true identity, the fact that he managed to humiliate Vader in single combat again.
3853340	3856360	His cover is entirely blown, but hey, it's okay.
3856360	3860460	As part of the reset button, Vader tells the Emperor he's not going to pursue Obi-Wan,
3860460	3863440	even though that goes against literally everything established about him.
3863440	3866660	This is Ian McDiamond, whatever his name is, his one scene in the show.
3866660	3872620	I bet he literally phoned his lines in over at Discord.
3872620	3873620	No!
3873620	3877340	These events have proven that Luke desperately needs you around, Obi-Wan.
3877340	3882180	There are Imperial files somewhere that link you to Bail Organa and his daughter, and then
3882180	3886820	you dropped a top secret message linking Bail Organa to the young boy in Uncle Owen's
3886820	3887820	care.
3887820	3891160	Now, the audience knows that Riva got a hold of the message and nobody else, but you don't
3891160	3892220	know that, Obi-Wan.
3892220	3896260	From your point of view, there's a trail of breadcrumbs out there leading Vader to
3896260	3898480	Luke, just waiting for somebody to stumble upon it.
3898480	3902880	And Obi-Wan is too fucking stupid to even recognize that it's the case.
3902880	3905180	But that's okay, because you know who's equally stupid?
3905180	3906340	Darth Vader himself.
3913180	3918140	So, Darth Vader is a retard, and it's not solely because of the Obi-Wan Kenobi show,
3918140	3922460	but that does give us the final puzzle pieces that allow us to definitively declare him
3922460	3923460	retarded.
3923460	3927380	Like I said earlier, Leia's association with Obi-Wan should mean that a Star Destroyer
3927380	3930580	should immediately land on the Organa family house.
3930580	3934300	Riva told the Grand Inquisitor that there was a connection between Obi-Wan and Bail
3934300	3935300	in the archives.
3935300	3937900	The Grand Inquisitor has witnessed the result of that connection.
3937900	3939100	Obi-Wan came out of hiding.
3939100	3942860	Yeah, Vader told the Emperor he wasn't going to obsess over Obi-Wan, which is this show's
3942860	3945020	hackneyed way of tying up the loose end.
3945020	3949040	But even with catching Obi-Wan off the table, surely the Grand Inquisitor is smart enough
3949040	3954700	to think, hmm, maybe I should go down to the Imperial archives myself and retrace Riva's
3954700	3955700	steps.
3955700	3959620	Not to find Kenobi himself, but maybe to find Bail's connection to him and the Rebels.
3959620	3963540	Even without Bail's incriminating message, Riva left the rest of the Imperial characters
3963540	3964880	enough clues to begin a hunt.
3964880	3969040	We know that Darth Vader doesn't learn that Luke is his son until the middle of Empire
3969040	3970040	Strikes Back.
3970040	3994220	George Lucas added this scene in one of the 50 remastered editions.
3994340	4006020	The original also informs him of the news, in a more roundabout way.
4006020	4010780	Bail Organa, Yoda, and Obi-Wan plotted at the end of Episode III to hide the children
4010780	4011780	away.
4024220	4036220	Yeah, we've already talked about how the Sith won't sense the Maximination is kind
4036220	4039260	of shit, considering the job that Leia is being groomed into.
4039260	4041540	God, I hate that that word's been ruined.
4041540	4044300	This is actually how you're supposed to use it, that you groom a person for leadership
4044300	4045300	at a young age.
4045300	4047460	Get your minds out of the gutter, you weirdos.
4047460	4049460	Vader knows he has family on Tatooine.
4049460	4053820	He and Padme visited them in Episode II, where Owen and Beru have Ani's old protocol droids,
4053820	4055460	C-3PO, which they take with them.
4055460	4060180	And then Uncle Owen buys back the same protocol droid 20 years later, without recognizing
4060180	4061180	him.
4061180	4062180	Geez.
4062180	4063180	Maybe Owen always was an idiot.
4063180	4067020	Yeah, stolen from me.
4067020	4070060	But they drop off Luke with these people, whom Vader already knows about.
4070060	4072640	And they don't even bother to change his fucking name?
4072640	4074820	Why does he call himself Luke Skywalker?
4074820	4077740	Why wouldn't it be Luke Lars to keep up the charade?
4077740	4082580	You know that it's supposed to be public record, that Padme lost her twins when she died, right?
4082580	4085200	That's why she's made to look pregnant during her funeral?
4085200	4086700	Because they were faking this shit?
4086700	4088660	Why did they keep that last name for Luke?
4088660	4089660	Okay, fine.
4089660	4090660	He's Luke Skywalker.
4090660	4094960	Somehow, word didn't get back to the Empire that, on the moisture farm where Vader knows
4094960	4099700	he has family, there's a young boy who looks and acts like him named Luke Skywalker.
4099700	4100700	Alright.
4100700	4103900	When the hunt for the Death Star plans in A New Hope brings Vader back to Tatooine,
4103900	4106380	do you think he's ever looking out the window and thinking like,
4106380	4109440	Hmm, I wonder how Owen and Beru are doing down there?
4109440	4111620	And then the search goes forward like we see in the movie.
4111620	4113460	Later Stormtroopers find the escape pod.
4113460	4115220	They find evidence that there's droids.
4115220	4117460	They follow the droid tracks to Jawa tracks.
4117460	4120500	They catch up with the Jawas, torture them for information on who bought the droids,
4120500	4123240	and then kill them, making it look like it was a Sand People attack.
4123240	4127220	The information leads them to the Lars farm, where they fucking disintegrate Uncle Owen
4127220	4128220	and Aunt Beru.
4128220	4131700	How in the hell do you think that conversation went back on the Star Destroyer?
4131700	4133420	So how did it go down there?
4133420	4136980	Well the droids were sold to a moisture farmer named Owen Lars, but the trail ran cold.
4136980	4139020	Oh, that's a funny coincidence.
4139020	4144580	Yeah don't worry though, we killed him to keep it a secret.
4144580	4146380	The Stormtroopers are looking for droids, right?
4146380	4151340	So maybe after torching the Lars family, the smart thing to do is to ransack the farm looking
4151340	4154140	for the droids or maybe any other information that might help.
4154140	4157380	Maybe the Stormtroopers find evidence that there's actually a third member of the family,
4157380	4161620	like say a teenage boy, another bedroom, a third bed, a smaller set of clothes, maybe
4161620	4164260	a toy or two that it turns out Obi-Wan gave him.
4164260	4168140	Maybe they find paperwork or evidence that this boy's name is Luke fucking Skywalker.
4168140	4172260	Maybe before Owen and Beru die they say that the droids aren't here right now, that their
4172260	4177380	son Luke fucking Skywalker is taking them to get maintenance in Anchorhead or something.
4177380	4180580	Surely this news gets back to Vader eventually in a mission report or something.
4180580	4185020	You'd think he'd be interested in this mysterious new young relative of his who has gone missing
4185020	4186540	with the plans of the Death Star.
4186540	4189180	You'd think that when the Rebels attack the Death Star at the end of the movie and the
4189180	4193700	Imperials figure out that they use the plans to find a weakness, and then Vader notices
4193700	4197660	the pilot who eventually hits the bullseye.
4197700	4200220	You think he might put two and two together?
4200220	4201860	TIE fighters can't go faster than light.
4201860	4202860	They're support craft.
4202860	4205780	Vader's got several decades to mull it over on his way home.
4205780	4207380	Okay, put it together buddy.
4207380	4210060	Who do you think that this young hotshot Rebel pilot could be?
4210060	4213720	It doesn't matter though, because if the Rebellion was smart, they'd double back and pick his
4213720	4214900	lonesome ass off.
4214900	4220900	You should have killed me when you had the chance, sister.
4220900	4227100	Oh, so you have a twin sister.
4227100	4230940	Your feelings have now betrayed her too.
4230940	4234300	Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from me.
4234300	4236500	And surely you should have put this one together too?
4236500	4239100	Vader, who was it that Riva illegally kidnapped?
4239100	4241140	Did the Grand Inquisitor just not tell you?
4241140	4245100	Did no one look at the records of the holding cell, the interrogation room, whatever?
4245100	4249460	There may be motivation to keep Obi-Wan's involvement a secret, but not to keep Leia's
4249460	4250460	kidnapping.
4251020	4253900	If the Lord would have gotten back to Vader eventually, Anakin really is retarded that
4253900	4255260	he didn't figure all this stuff out.
4255260	4258020	You know, I'm starting to think that Star Wars was always stupid.
4258020	4261000	And I guess in that sense, the Obi-Wan Kenobi show fits right in.
4261000	4263740	This is the quintessential cool scene-itis show.
4263740	4266860	It's so formulaic, it feels like it was written by an algorithm.
4266860	4268020	And here's what I mean by that.
4268020	4271940	George Lucas set it up at the end of Revenge of the Sith, such that all the pieces are
4271940	4273620	in place for Episode IV to begin.
4273620	4274740	Yoda's on Dagobah.
4274740	4275940	Bail adopts Leia.
4275940	4277260	Uncle Owen adopts Luke.
4277260	4279940	C-3PO's memory is wiped to protect Leia's identity.
4279940	4283900	But R2-D2's isn't, making him a colossal asshole who could have told anybody everything
4283900	4285560	at any time and he just didn't.
4285560	4290460	So an Obi-Wan Kenobi show taking place in Episodes III and IV has to do a few things.
4290460	4293020	Firstly, it can't majorly disrupt the lore.
4293020	4296100	Whatever happens during the show, we have to end up back where we started, with the
4296100	4298120	pieces still in place for Episode IV.
4298120	4299960	Which means you have two options.
4299960	4303600	Option A, it's a tiny character piece exploring Obi-Wan and his solitude.
4303600	4308320	Option B, anything done that could mess up the lore, if left unresolved, has to be resolved
4308320	4310600	such that the integrity of the story is maintained.
4310600	4314440	Secondly, it can't betray the characterization of the people that the audience cares about.
4314440	4317900	There's a natural midpoint between who these people are in Episode III and who they become
4317900	4321160	in Episode IV, and that can be a very precise target to hit.
4321160	4324360	In other words, it has to respect the story and it has to respect the characters.
4324360	4327080	Does Obi-Wan Kenobi do either of these things?
4327080	4328320	Let's start with the characters.
4328320	4329840	Obi-Wan is pretty much spot on.
4329840	4332080	Uncle Owen's conflict with him is only natural.
4332080	4334960	Leia seems about correct even though her actress isn't great.
4334960	4335960	Vader?
4335960	4337000	I don't know about this one.
4337000	4340840	People tend to forget how tame Vader was in A New Hope, he was always a Saturday morning
4340840	4341840	cartoon villain.
4341840	4342840	We meet again at last.
4342840	4343840	The circle is now complete.
4343840	4351040	When I left you I was but the learner, now I am the master.
4351040	4355940	I think that's why, when fans recreated the Vader-Obi-Wan fight from Episode IV, to make
4355940	4360640	it more line up with their physical abilities from Episode III, they also made Vader a lot
4360640	4361640	angrier.
4361640	4363280	Okay, how about the plot then?
4363280	4367500	Well, you just listened to my over an hour long epic rant on how this one's an obvious
4367500	4368500	NO.
4368500	4371400	I don't think I've ever written anything this detailed for my channel in my entire
4371400	4372400	life.
4372400	4374680	This show has almost an infinite number of problems.
4374680	4377600	Firstly, it can't choose what kind of story it wants to be.
4377600	4381020	A tiny character piece or an epic adventure with a big reset button.
4381020	4382360	So it tries to do both.
4382360	4385880	One A and one B. The first episode, showing Obi-Wan's depression and the state of his
4385880	4386880	life.
4386880	4387880	That shit is great.
4387880	4390160	I know some fanboys were complaining that they made Obi-Wan a cuck, but I don't care.
4390160	4391160	It was good.
4391160	4393760	That's exactly what you should do if you're making this kind of show.
4393760	4398080	Obi-Wan's lost, he's defeated, and billions of people are now suffering because he failed.
4398080	4402080	He should be a scarred character, and the triumphant hero story of how he gets his mojo
4402080	4404440	back, that is exactly what this narrative needs.
4404440	4406440	This series also answers another question.
4406440	4409040	Why Obi-Wan doesn't think that Vader can be redeemed.
4409040	4411360	There is still good in him.
4411360	4414120	He's more machine now than man.
4414120	4416360	Twisted and evil.
4416360	4419680	I mean, you can kind of imply it from the prequels, but at least here it's spelled
4419680	4420680	out explicitly.
4421200	4424560	Also, they kind of shoehorn in him, calling Anakin, Darth.
4424560	4428880	Goodbye, Darth.
4428880	4430840	Which I don't know, it doesn't really work, but fine.
4430840	4435560	But all the character stuff from one A suffers from all the rebellion stuff from one B, and
4435560	4437800	that's all just pure garbage.
4437800	4439280	None of those characters are likable.
4439280	4442840	None of them matter in the long run, except Leia, and she necessarily has plot armor the
4442840	4443840	whole show.
4443840	4445360	How many plot holes are there in this story?
4445360	4446740	How many unnecessary arcs?
4446740	4448040	How many unnecessary scenes?
4448040	4450400	How many lines of dialogue that just make no sense?
4450400	4452440	I'm sorry, but that's not my problem.
4452440	4455360	Look, if you want my help, you got it.
4455360	4459640	Soon the location of the network and Kenobi will be ours.
4459640	4461360	Kenobi is all that matters.
4461360	4462800	You're in, die, you know.
4462800	4464520	All signals in or out are blocked.
4464520	4466400	I let your parents know you're safe.
4466400	4471240	I know he said no communication, but your silence worries me.
4471240	4475040	I am what you made me.
4475040	4478440	I am not your failure, Obi-Wan.
4478480	4483480	No matter whether he dies or I do, this ends today.
4483480	4488280	Goodbye, Darth.
4488280	4495520	But there's always a teacher, someone who mentors the young hero in what his destiny
4495520	4496520	is.
4496520	4502320	And in this case, it's an old Jedi who has been sitting out in the desert primarily waiting
4502320	4504320	for this moment to happen.
4504320	4514320	He served me well during the Clone Wars and has lived in hiding since the Emperor's Purge.
4514320	4516200	Yes, I will send for him.
4516200	4517200	One last fight.
4517200	4520840	He's been sitting out in the desert primarily waiting for this moment to happen.
4520840	4523940	He's lived in hiding since the Emperor's Purge.
4523940	4525920	One last fight.
4525920	4530000	Also, if you're telling a story and you want the audience to care, the rules have to be
4530000	4531840	at least somewhat consistent.
4531840	4536080	If Darth Vader can extinguish flames at the Force or pull a starship down from takeoff,
4536080	4539000	you can't just have him not be able to do it a second later.
4539000	4541820	There has to be a consistent idea of what the stakes are.
4541820	4545940	If people keep surviving gut-stabbings, no matter how many fucking stomachs they have,
4545940	4550120	the audience's reaction to a scene like this isn't, oh my god, he's dead, it's, I wonder
4550120	4551280	if they'll bring him back or not.
4551280	4555140	If anything, the moral lesson of Star Wars is at this point, when you kill somebody,
4555140	4557160	make sure to actually fucking finish the job.
4557160	4561560	The Grand Inquisitor comes back, Darth Maul's come back now, Riva came back twice.
4562400	4567240	There's also just a bunch of small things that bug me about Kenobi too.
4567240	4569960	Yeah, the quality is all over the place like I mentioned at the start of the video.
4569960	4572080	But also, Vader looks weird in this show.
4572080	4576360	I know it's not just Hayden Christensen's scrawny ass in that suit, but still, something's
4576360	4577360	off.
4577360	4580320	They keep showing him in these wide shots far away from everyone else, so no one's making
4580320	4581820	any comparisons about his size.
4581820	4583440	Look at the Riva Force choke scene.
4583440	4587120	Riva is clearly his height, except when he gets closer and then it's like, whoops, he's
4587120	4588800	suddenly two feet taller than her.
4588800	4590840	It's not just the visuals though, it's the writing too.
4590840	4594440	Riva's got like three scenes setting up her storyline in the first episode.
4594440	4596200	Leia goes running through the woods twice.
4596200	4598400	We've got three days at Obi-Wan's dreary job.
4598400	4601400	And it's not just establishing scenes that repeat.
4601400	4604220	How many times did Obi-Wan have private conversations in public?
4604220	4606360	Or how many times did he try to sacrifice himself?
4606360	4609560	Hell, the entirety of Episode 4 is just filler.
4609560	4610560	Think about it.
4610560	4615240	The total arc of the show is, Leia's kidnapped, Obi-Wan goes to help, he rescues Leia on Daewoo,
4615240	4619000	he has to get smuggled by the Rebels off-world to some mining planet, I still don't know
4619000	4622000	the name, I still don't care to look it up, where the Empire catches up and Obi-Wan has
4622000	4623960	to confront Vader, the Ghost from his past.
4623960	4626720	Obi-Wan loses that fight, this is the low point of the story.
4626720	4631380	Leia's kidnapped a second time, Obi-Wan rescues her again, they go to the Rebel base on Jabiim,
4631380	4635580	the Empire lays siege to it, the Rebels escape just in time, Obi-Wan has his second showdown
4635580	4636580	and wins.
4636580	4641100	You can cut out the Leia re-kidnap and re-rescue bit from Episode 4 entirely and the story
4641100	4642360	is completely fine.
4642360	4646400	In fact, it's better because the lore-breaking scene where Leia reveals to agents of the
4646400	4649600	Empire that she knows Obi-Wan is cut out along with that arc.
4649600	4654160	In prep for this video, I think I've watched this show about 4 times now, God rest my soul,
4654160	4659040	and I've really begun to notice just how many times micro-arcs repeat only to pad out the
4659040	4660880	runtime of what should have been a movie.
4660880	4664840	We know that this story was originally supposed to be a movie, Kenobi the Balance of the Force.
4664840	4668920	Disney sees the writing on the wall when it comes to TV shows and miniseries versus movies,
4668920	4673040	especially after the success of The Mandalorian versus the failure of Solo A Star Wars Story.
4673040	4676840	So they took their script for Kenobi A Star Wars Story and stretched it out to Kenobi
4676840	4678040	A 6 Episode Story.
4678040	4681600	In fact, several people have already re-cut it into a movie and as a movie it actually
4681600	4682600	works pretty well.
4682600	4685880	I mean it's not perfect, but if you only use the footage and the plot on hand, you
4685880	4688360	can actually make an okay feature film out of this.
4688360	4691360	It still doesn't hold a candle to the Kenobi fan film though, which basically does the
4691360	4694940	quiet Tatooine character story and does it 10,000 times better.
4694940	4696200	It's all the same beats.
4696200	4699720	Obi-Wan is old and downtrodden, he's losing his connection to the Force, Uncle Owen wants
4699720	4702540	him to go away, and by the end Obi-Wan gets his mojo back.
4702540	4704140	But it's actually legitimately good.
4704140	4707580	The fans really do understand Star Wars in a way that Disney doesn't.
4707580	4711780	At this point, it's obvious to me just how much of Kenobi is a repeat of something we've
4711780	4712780	seen before.
4712780	4717060	Yeah, they repeat scenes, or they repeat whole arcs even just to fill the hour, but it's
4717060	4718420	not only that.
4718420	4722180	Pretty much everything noteworthy from this show is taken from something else.
4722180	4725100	This part's from the fan film, this part's from Return of the Jedi, this part's from
4725100	4727220	the video game, this part's from Rogue One.
4727220	4734700	And the linchpin moment of the show has already been done before, in Rebels with Ahsoka Tano.
4734700	4738580	I know, I know, it's just a TV show, stop caring Dev, why can't you just shut your
4738580	4742220	brain off and let the images enter through your eyes and have a mildly entertaining evening?
4742220	4745940	I understand that point of view, and there is some value in just liking something for
4745940	4747740	the spectacle, even if it is dumb.
4747740	4753160	But that has to be a choice that you as the viewer make, not they as the creator insist
4753160	4754160	that you choose.
4754160	4757060	Okay, here's a good example, this happened back in 2015.
4757060	4758740	Back when the video game Fallout 4 came out.
4758740	4761500	If you don't know anything about Fallout, here's the quick TLDR.
4761500	4765440	Nuclear war happens, Americans take shelter in vaults built by the Vault-Tec Corporation.
4765440	4769140	Some of the vaults turn out to be weird social experiments set up to study human behavior.
4769140	4773060	Vault 95 was housed with only drug addicts, and there were no drugs in the vault.
4773060	4777240	Except, five years in, a massive stash of drugs would be revealed in a hidden location
4777240	4778240	in the vault.
4778240	4781480	The problem is, one of the logs the player can find is written by a delivery man, where
4781480	4783620	he says that he's delivering a shipment of Jet.
4783620	4787260	Jet is a fictional drug in Fallout, it's a weird cross between meth and jankum made
4787260	4789980	from the fumes of dung from irradiated cattle.
4789980	4793700	Jet was invented after the bombs dropped, so there was no way that a pre-war delivery
4793700	4796100	man was bringing a shipment to Vault 95.
4796100	4799020	Now this is a problem that's very easy to fix, especially in a video game.
4799020	4802660	You just say, oh sorry guys, my mistake, and then in the next patch just change the text
4802660	4803660	of the log.
4803660	4804660	One and done, right?
4804660	4805660	But that's not what happened.
4805660	4810020	The writer of that quest, Pete Hines, when the inconsistency went viral on Twitter, replied
4810020	4814160	with saying, doesn't say what year that was posted, implying that after the bombs
4814160	4818820	had dropped and Jet had been invented, Vault-Tec was somehow still around and still sending
4818820	4821140	out trucks of drugs to Vault 95.
4821140	4825380	When the fan pointed out the obvious flaw in that logic, as well as other consistency
4825380	4830060	problems, Pete Hines gave this response, not interested in discussing how realistic things
4830060	4834780	are in an alternate universe post-apocalyptic game with talking mutants and ghouls.
4834780	4839480	And of course, various game and tech-based news outlets backed him up, making fun of
4839480	4845240	fans who dared to complain about lore inconsistencies because of not taking the series seriously
4845240	4849960	enough that features aliens, a talking tree, invincible children, and guns that fire miniature
4849960	4850960	nuclear warheads.
4850960	4854840	And it's like, on some level, yeah, that actually makes sense.
4854840	4856200	It is just a story.
4856200	4857320	It's just a fictional world.
4857320	4861320	So if the new writers working on it make a mistake, on some level, you shouldn't take
4861320	4862460	it too seriously.
4862460	4866780	But the flip side of that, as part of not taking it seriously, is no longer consuming
4866780	4867780	it.
4867780	4870860	The game is created by Interplay, though the games are now made by Bethesda, which
4870860	4873420	is a whole other rabbit hole not worth going down for this video.
4873420	4877260	The point is, Bethesda is not the creator of Fallout, they're only its current owners.
4877260	4880660	The people who work at Bethesda might care to a point, but if push comes to shove, they
4880660	4882620	prioritize their own vision.
4882620	4885780	And stuff like this is ultimately how they view it.
4885780	4889440	Because while if you're a fan of Fallout, it means something to you, that's why you
4889440	4893200	enjoy it, that's why you're the superfan, but to them, it's only a vehicle for their
4893200	4894200	new story.
4894200	4899000	If they can get away with not respecting old lore, not simply just to save face in a Twitter
4899000	4903440	fight, but also because the old lore gets in the way of the new story they want to tell,
4903440	4907560	and they believe that you'll continue consuming the product, what incentive do they have to
4907560	4908800	respect the old lore?
4908800	4913040	And through that lens, we can understand why Pete Hines took it as a personal attack, that
4913040	4917840	fans pointed out there was inconsistencies between his writing and what came before.
4917840	4921040	Now how many times have you heard a story like this?
4921040	4922040	How many video games?
4922040	4923040	How many TV shows?
4923040	4924040	How many movies?
4924880	4926000	Something equivalent to this happened to.
4926000	4928560	People take these things seriously because they love them.
4928560	4932680	When they see inconsistencies, they're worried that the new stewards don't actually care.
4932680	4936300	And when those new stewards respond like this, it's a confirmation that they're really
4936300	4940560	only here to wear the progressive skin suit of the thing that you love, to ignore pre-established
4940560	4943040	storylines and push whatever it is they want to push.
4943040	4945960	So apply this lens back to Star Wars, and what do you see?
4945960	4950040	When I watched that final scene with Riva crying in the sand, I had a sinking feeling
4950040	4952520	that this whole thing existed simply to set up her spin-off show.
4952680	4956360	They were taking a beloved character, this guy in the title, and using him as the opening
4956360	4958840	act for the story they actually wanted to tell.
4958840	4961640	This is like bait-and-switch Member Berries, where you think you're getting the Member
4961640	4963320	Berries you want and that's how they drag you in.
4963320	4964320	But it was me, Riva!
4964320	4968280	Jesus, we're this far into the video and I completely forgot to talk about the Qui-Gon
4968280	4969280	scene.
4969280	4970960	I actually forgot about it, it's that forgettable.
4970960	4972920	I'm re-recording this days later.
4972920	4976980	One of the big Member Berries scenes of Kenobi is in the very end, where Qui-Gon shows up
4976980	4981360	as a Force ghost and basically says, get ready for season two, you fucking nerds.
4981400	4986440	This scene serves no purpose whatsoever, other than to get fanboys to record reaction videos,
4986440	4989000	like how they reacted to Luke at the end of Mando season two.
5011360	5027520	A far better use of Qui-Gon would have been, in the scene where Obi-Wan is buried by rocks
5027520	5031120	during the Vader fight, Qui-Gon whispers to him, it wasn't your fault.
5031120	5032220	And that would have made sense.
5032220	5036500	The whole story is, or should be, about Obi-Wan coming to grips with his guilt.
5036500	5040360	In A Phantom Menace, Obi-Wan didn't want to train Anakin, Qui-Gon did.
5040360	5042940	And Qui-Gon made Obi-Wan promise him to do it.
5042940	5047260	The rock Berries scene would have been far superior with Qui-Gon in it, than with Obi-Wan
5047260	5051640	fantasizing about kids, but it wouldn't have given us that reactable moment that Disney
5051640	5052640	wanted.
5052640	5056580	Yet again, they sacrificed the soul of the story for what looked cool.
5056580	5061640	The reason people originally liked Star Wars is because, despite the many flaws of these
5061640	5064160	movies, it had something to say about the human condition.
5064160	5067980	It's not really about stormtroopers and death stars and X-wings and lightsabers.
5067980	5068980	Those are the trappings.
5068980	5069980	That's the window dressing.
5070020	5072940	That's what you drape over top of what should be, a good solid story.
5072940	5076020	George Lucas has correctly identified that A New Hope is more of a fantasy film than
5076020	5077020	a sci-fi one.
5077020	5083740	My original inspiration on this film was really to use mythological motifs to create a whole
5083740	5088540	new kind of myth that was very updated and contemporary.
5088540	5094800	So I used the Saturday matinee serial as my vessel to put this barrel of mythological
5094800	5096300	motifs together.
5096340	5100580	Since it's based on a very kind of old story and not a high-tech story, it's more of a
5100580	5105020	fantasy film than a science fiction film, I was able to use archetypes which helped
5105020	5110120	develop the characters and put them in a context where they could be easily grasped because
5110120	5111940	they are traditional characters.
5111940	5118260	And this is the same story that has been told a thousand times around the world for several
5118260	5119620	thousand years.
5119620	5120740	This is a mythic story.
5120740	5124180	It models for us what it means to be a hero in a very generic sense.
5124380	5128380	Luke Skywalker is a child of destiny given a magic sword by an old wizard and told to
5128380	5131700	storm a fortress guarded by the Black Knight in order to rescue a princess.
5131700	5136020	The scope and scale of the story, along with 4 1977 state-of-the-art effects, help cover
5136020	5139100	up the fact that Star Wars is a very basic hero's journey.
5139100	5141780	Meanwhile, The Empire Strikes Back turns us on its head.
5141780	5145160	It's a story about how the hero deals with his own failure, how it's his own heroism
5145160	5148980	that is the source of the failure, and how to come to grips with the terrible truth.
5148980	5151460	Luke's heroic traits are well-defined in A New Hope.
5151460	5153640	He's courageous, loyal, and impulsive.
5153640	5157800	All qualities well-suited for a young man leaping to the defense of the helpless.
5157800	5161880	But in Empire, these qualities lead him to a confrontation with Vader that he isn't
5161880	5164320	ready for and he loses badly.
5164320	5167280	Yoda tells him point blank before it even happens.
5167280	5173920	If you end your training now, if you choose the quick and easy path as Vader did, you
5173920	5175780	will become an agent of evil.
5175780	5179520	But Luke has to experience it to truly understand the path that he's on.
5179520	5181960	Return of the Jedi is the culmination of this story.
5181960	5185480	Luke's first appearance in the movie, he's acting a little bit more Sith-like than the
5185480	5189040	audience should be comfortable with, but at the same time, he's also more patient.
5189040	5193740	He allows Jabba to make aggressive moves and mistakes while his own plan unfolds.
5193740	5196380	This is what integrating your dark side looks like.
5196380	5199040	By the end of the movie, Luke refuses to kill Vader.
5199040	5203320	In fact, at the end of all three movies, Luke gives up control and takes a leap of faith.
5203320	5206960	It's not a foregone conclusion that Vader will rescue him from the Emperor's forced
5206960	5207960	lightning.
5207960	5211320	Luke is doing this knowing full well he might die, but the statement is clear.
5211320	5214600	Luke is not going to become his father, even if it kills him.
5214600	5217800	Yeah, sometimes George Lucas is caught huffing his farts a bit too much.
5217800	5228920	I said to George, you can type this stuff, but you can't say it.
5228920	5232920	Move your mouth while you're talking, while you're typing it.
5232920	5234240	I couldn't say it.
5234240	5238280	But even then, the point I'm making is when you strip away all the Star Wars stuff here
5238280	5242400	there's a soul, a moral and ethical through line that cuts right down the center of Luke
5242400	5243400	and his journey.
5243400	5246780	The movies are trying to tell us something about what it means to be a hero, what quality
5246780	5251300	of character a hero has, where that might lead them astray sometimes, and ultimately
5251300	5254800	what somebody might have to sacrifice in order to live a good life.
5254800	5258040	And George Lucas is okay with outright saying, yeah, this is what the movies are all about.
5258040	5263320	Are you saying I am trying to recreate the myths of old or are you saying I just want
5263320	5266240	to make a good action movie?
5266240	5274520	Well when I did Star Wars, I consciously set about to recreate myths and the classic mythological
5274520	5280520	motifs, because I think the core issues that I'm dealing with are if they were valid 2,000
5280520	5284640	years ago, they've got to still be valid today, even though they're not in fashion.
5284640	5285960	Why are they out of fashion?
5285960	5287960	The world we live in is more complex.
5287960	5292680	A lot of those moralities have gotten to be grayed to the point where they don't exist
5292680	5295920	anymore, but those issues are still there in most people's minds.
5296800	5301560	The importance of, say, friendship and loyalty, most people look at that and say, how corny,
5301560	5306240	but the issues of friendship and loyalty are very, very important, but it's not common
5306240	5307760	knowledge among young people.
5307760	5308760	They're still learning.
5308760	5309920	They're still picking up ideas.
5309920	5314440	They're still using these ideas to shape the way they're going to conduct their life, and
5314440	5318560	you need to tell the same story over and over again every generation, so that generation
5318560	5319560	gets it.
5319560	5324880	And I think we've gone for a few generations where a lot of the more basic stories have
5324880	5326280	fallen by the wayside.
5326280	5331520	I hear so many young people today talk about a world that's emptied of heroism, where there
5331520	5335200	are no more noble things to do.
5335200	5337280	What do you say to them?
5337280	5340120	Everybody becomes, everybody has the choice of being a hero or not being a hero every
5340120	5342280	day of their lives.
5342280	5346960	And you can either help somebody be compassionate toward people, or you can treat some people
5346960	5349040	with dignity or not.
5349040	5354240	And one way you become a hero, and the other way, you know, you're part of the problem.
5354680	5357000	And it's not a grand thing.
5357000	5362920	You know, you don't have to get into a giant laser sword fight and blow up three spaceships
5362920	5363920	to become a hero.
5363920	5367400	I mean, it's a very small thing that happens every day of your life.
5367400	5371640	Though people don't like the prequel trilogy nearly as much, they're still remembered fondly
5371640	5373160	for being the mess that they are.
5373160	5377680	And Lucas is also quite insistent that these films also have something to say beyond just
5377680	5378680	Star Wars.
5378680	5381560	In fact, Padme even spotlights the message in case you don't get it.
5381560	5386840	So this is how liberty dies, with thunderous applause.
5386840	5390840	One of the reasons the prequel trilogy talks so much about politics and economics is because
5390840	5395240	it's showing what a fearless, well-meaning, impatient young hero, somebody very much like
5395240	5399640	Luke, in fact, can become if he doesn't take the sacrificial path that Luke did.
5399640	5402280	Take that scene from episode two where Padme and Anakin talk politics.
5402280	5404520	Yeah, that one that became a reaction meme for a while.
5404520	5407040	I don't think the system works.
5407040	5410080	How would you have it work?
5410080	5414680	We need a system where the politicians sit down and discuss the problem.
5414680	5418280	Agree what's in the best interest of all the people, and then do it.
5418280	5420640	That's exactly what we do.
5420640	5422520	The trouble is that people don't always agree.
5422520	5424720	Well, then they should be made to.
5424720	5425720	By whom?
5425720	5426720	Who's gonna make them?
5426720	5427720	I don't know.
5427720	5428720	Someone.
5428720	5429720	You?
5429720	5430720	Of course not me.
5430720	5431720	But someone.
5431720	5432720	Someone wise.
5432720	5436880	Sounds an awful lot like a dictatorship to me.
5436880	5439240	Well, if it works.
5439240	5442080	This is actually the monarchist argument against democracy.
5442080	5446520	If democracy really is just a bunch of squabbling, uneducated fools, all having their worthless
5446520	5451160	say while a crisis grows more desperate, why shouldn't a strong individual with the expertise
5451160	5453400	to solve the problem be in charge instead?
5453400	5456360	It's the benevolent dictator, philosopher king argument.
5456360	5460640	Palpatine's populist rhetoric during his rise to power, if you transplant it to real life,
5460640	5463800	is probably pretty popular with libertarians in how he wants to dismantle components of
5463800	5466000	the state and end corruption and shrink bureaucracy.
5466000	5469800	There is no civility, only politics.
5469800	5475520	The senate is full of greedy, squabbling delegates.
5475520	5478120	There is no interest in the common good.
5478120	5482040	If I may say so, your majesty, the chancellor has little real power.
5482040	5486120	He is mired by baseless accusations of corruption.
5486120	5488400	The bureaucrats are in charge now.
5488400	5493920	Our best choice would be to push for the election of a stronger supreme chancellor, one who
5493920	5497920	could control the bureaucrats and give us justice.
5497920	5503000	Any other choice would be to submit a plea to the courts.
5503000	5506040	The courts take even longer to decide things than the senate.
5506040	5510200	Your majesty, if I am elected, I promise to put an end to corruption.
5510200	5512120	I will be, chancellor.
5512120	5515760	I fear by the time you have control of the bureaucrats, senator, there'll be nothing
5515760	5518560	left of our people, our way of life.
5518560	5522280	It is clear to me now that the republic no longer functions.
5522280	5525920	I pray you will bring sanity and compassion back to the senate.
5525920	5529920	But what his supporters don't understand, and what he keenly recognizes, is that all
5529920	5534660	of those multiple levels of bureaucracy are what keeps political power decentralized.
5534660	5538600	That decentralization has led to their current problem, where there's too many interests,
5538600	5541960	nobody can agree on anything, and nothing gets done even in the face of a civil war.
5541960	5545480	But stripping away those bureaucratic layers, however popular a move it might initially
5545480	5548400	be, doesn't destroy the political power vested within them.
5548400	5551680	It simply centralizes that power within the remaining bureaucracy.
5551680	5555280	The rebellion will continue to gain us support in the imperial senate.
5555280	5559460	The imperial senate will no longer be of any concern to us.
5559460	5563960	I have just received word that the emperor has dissolved the council permanently.
5563960	5567560	The last remnants of the old republic have been swept away.
5567560	5568560	That's impossible.
5568560	5572400	How will the emperor maintain control without the bureaucracy?
5572400	5576760	The regional governors now have direct control over their territories.
5576760	5580600	It may very well be the case that if the people within a state's apparatus are corrupt, you
5580600	5581600	might need to clean house.
5582520	5583520	It's not against that.
5583520	5585840	But contrary to what libertarians think, shrinking the state doesn't always shrink
5585840	5586840	its power.
5586840	5590880	Sometimes, it centralizes that power into a system with a single point of failure.
5590880	5595200	That's why the rebellion's decisive strikes, at just the right target, are so devastating
5595200	5596260	throughout the series.
5596260	5600040	Because when you weaken a state's bureaucracy, you monopolize the state's power into one
5600040	5603400	autocratic leader, and at that point, all you have to do is kill him.
5603400	5605080	That is the lesson of the prequels.
5605080	5607880	The dangers of seduction, both sexual and political.
5607880	5611400	It's tempting to think that you know all the answers, that you can handle the forbidden
5611400	5612400	fruit.
5612400	5613400	But you don't.
5613400	5614400	And you can't.
5614400	5616000	Of course, the prequels have many problems.
5616000	5618040	Like a lot of what the Jedi are don't really make sense.
5618040	5619960	For example, why do the Jedi wear these robes?
5619960	5622300	Well, because that's what Obi-Wan wore in the original trilogy.
5622300	5625800	But if Obi-Wan's in hiding, why would he specifically run around in the uniform of
5625800	5627100	a persecuted class of people?
5627100	5629080	Why do all the Jedi act like creepy cult members?
5629080	5633040	Well, because Luke's journey from regular kid to Jedi Knight saw him become serious
5633040	5634040	and somber.
5634040	5636040	But that's only because of what he was going through with his father.
5636040	5640080	That is the limitation of George Lucas's iconic hero's journey style of storytelling,
5640080	5642100	when it butts up against a cultural phenomenon.
5642100	5645880	Whatever becomes emblematic of an idea is what sticks, even if it doesn't really make
5645880	5646880	any sense.
5646880	5650400	But it's this rough-around-the-edges nature of Lucas's Star Wars that lead internet
5650400	5655300	soy boys nowadays to justify the moral bankruptcy of Disney's Star Wars.
5655300	5659240	So if the original story is telling us how to be a sacrificial hero, and the prequel
5659240	5663740	story is telling us what happens if you reject the call, what does the sequel trilogy tell
5663740	5664740	us?
5664740	5668360	As far as I can tell, The Force Awakens exists to tell us that Star Wars is really cool.
5668360	5670000	Everything is a reference or a callback.
5670000	5674000	They exist not as trappings of a larger story, but as the larger story itself.
5674000	5677760	Where before the movies would explain a political crisis and the various parties therein, or
5677760	5681240	a personal conflict between characters with a lot of history, now the movie goes out of
5681240	5682800	its way to not explain anything at all.
5682800	5685240	J.J. Abrams said he wanted the Star Wars comedy back.
5685240	5689280	But where before comedy accentuated characterization, here it undercuts it.
5689280	5692480	The characters in the setting are reset back to the way things were in A New Hope, only
5692480	5693640	this time with less explanation.
5693640	5696000	There's an empire and a rebellion with different names.
5696000	5699120	Luke is isolated from everyone, Leia is a political leader fighting the power.
5699240	5702880	Han Solo is a smooth talker desperately trying to hide the fact that he's a broke bum.
5702880	5706620	All of the growth and change is reversed, so we can do Star Wars again.
5706620	5708240	What does The Last Jedi have to tell us?
5708240	5710920	Well, pretty much the opposite of The Force Awakens.
5710920	5712040	Star Wars is bad.
5712040	5715700	Where in Empire, Luke would never abandon his friends, and in Return of the Jedi, Luke
5715700	5717960	chose not to kill the defenseless.
5717960	5721000	Here we discover that Luke did both of those things in his old age.
5721000	5724440	Everyone talks about the phrase, subverting expectations with this movie, and yeah, fair
5724440	5725440	enough.
5725440	5735280	I don't want to go into just how bad this movie is right now.
5735280	5739560	This video is long enough, but I don't think the phrase, subvert expectations, is the ethic
5739560	5740560	of this movie.
5740560	5742680	Instead, it can be summed up in these scenes.
5742680	5745920	It's time to let old things die.
5745920	5757480	Snoke, Skywalker, the Sith, the Jedi, the Rebels, let it all die.
5757480	5763480	Let the past die, kill it if you have to.
5763480	5766320	We have what they grow beyond.
5766320	5771440	That is the true burden of all masters.
5771440	5773680	The idea here is that Star Wars is changing.
5773680	5776280	It doesn't have to be about Skywalkers and Kenobi's anymore.
5776280	5777280	It can be about anybody.
5777280	5778940	That's the point of the final shot of the movie.
5778940	5781480	This kid isn't anybody important, and yet he can use the Force.
5781480	5783760	It's a grand moral equalization.
5783760	5785260	The old institutions don't matter.
5785260	5788680	We can make things how we want them to be, and they don't need to be Star Wars.
5788680	5791560	So what is the rise of Skywalker telling us then?
5791560	5795200	Well, the lesson of The Force Awakens is that we can no longer make anything new.
5795200	5797600	We must remain tethered to what Star Wars was.
5797600	5800960	At the same time, the lesson of The Last Jedi is that we can no longer hold on to anything
5800960	5801960	old.
5801960	5803000	The slate must be wiped clean.
5803000	5806240	Despite how it sounds, these two ideas actually fit together.
5806240	5810180	In a Hegelian sense, if The Force Awakens is the thesis and The Last Jedi is the antithesis,
5810180	5812120	The Rise of Skywalker is the synthesis.
5812120	5815460	It's a movie that is simultaneously tethered to the past while rejecting it.
5815460	5820160	It wipes the slate clean and then uses that space to build a simulacrum of what came before.
5820160	5823880	The ethics of Star Wars at this point are gone, and what remains is only the window
5823880	5824880	dressing.
5824880	5828160	There are X-wings and lightsabers and stormtroopers and star destroyers, but the core has been
5828160	5829160	hollowed out.
5829160	5831560	That's why it rings so hollow when Carrie Fisher says
5831560	5835560	It's about family, and that's what's so powerful about it.
5835560	5836560	We know they're not.
5836560	5839200	They're about being about family, which is a very different idea.
5839200	5842880	At least Mark Hamill was a lot more honest about them.
5842880	5848360	I said to Ryan, I said, I think I fundamentally disagree with pretty much everything you've
5848360	5849560	decided for me.
5849560	5855760	Now, having said that, I have to accept it, get my mind around it, and do my best to realize
5855760	5856760	your vision.
5856760	5859600	But I said to Ryan, I said, Jedis don't give up.
5859600	5866640	I mean, even if he had a problem, he would maybe take a year to try and regroup.
5866640	5869200	But if he made a mistake, he would try and right that wrong.
5869200	5871400	So right there, we had a fundamental difference.
5871400	5873960	But it's not my story anymore.
5873960	5879160	It's somebody else's story, and Ryan needed me to be a certain way to make the ending
5879160	5880860	effective.
5880860	5884600	That's the crux of my problem.
5884600	5886680	Luke would never say that.
5886680	5887680	I'm sorry.
5887680	5891800	Well, in this version, see, I'm talking about the George Lucas Star Wars.
5891800	5893800	This is the next generation of Star Wars.
5893800	5897320	So I almost had to think of Luke as another character.
5897320	5898800	Maybe he's Jake Skywalker.
5898800	5901200	He's not my Luke Skywalker.
5901200	5906680	But I had to do what Ryan wanted me to do because it serves the story well.
5906680	5909560	But listen, I still haven't accepted it completely.
5909560	5910940	But it's only a movie.
5910940	5912040	I hope people like it.
5912040	5913320	I hope they don't get upset.
5913320	5918280	In other words, the Star Wars sequel trilogy teaches us how you build a progressive skin
5918280	5919280	suit.
5919280	5923440	First, stagnation is celebrated by way of worshipping the aesthetics of the Thing.
5923440	5927340	Secondly, revolution is celebrated by way of discrediting all the old ethical achievements
5927340	5928340	of the Thing.
5928340	5932440	Finally, these two ideas are married into a creation that is simply mechanical in how
5932440	5933700	it operates.
5933700	5936760	Scenes happen only because they must happen to reach the next scene.
5936760	5940880	Conflicts or revelations or sacrifices occur not because they further anything, but because
5940880	5943980	this is around the point in time the audience expects to see one.
5943980	5947600	Nothing makes sense, but nothing needs to because we've deconstructed the idea of
5947600	5948760	cause and effect.
5948760	5953480	Things might be set up and then paid off like in an actual movie, but there's no underlying
5953480	5954940	action and reaction.
5954940	5956820	The progressive skin suit is complete.
5956820	5961040	It looks like Star Wars, but deep inside it is in fact anti-Star Wars.
5961040	5964080	You can't even make new films anymore, not without disregarding 7, 8, and 9.
5964080	5965600	Where would you go with the story?
5965600	5968900	Everything's already been ruined by people who didn't care that they were ruining it.
5968900	5972400	Which makes it pretty fucking hilarious that Kathleen Kennedy complained there was no
5972400	5977360	more Star Wars stories to make, considering that Lucasfilm de-canonized nearly everything
5977360	5979040	and then deconstructed the rest.
5979040	5982380	And by the way, it should be no surprise that George Lucas isn't all that happy with how
5982380	5983380	it's going either.
5983380	5986140	Bob Iger said, gee, if you really want to sell your company, if you're thinking about
5986140	5988660	selling it, because we were talking about retirement and what are you going to do after
5988660	5989660	all this.
5989660	5992660	And he said, well, you really want to sell it, you know, we're very interested.
5992660	6002380	I sold them to the white slavers that take these things and I made a decision to move
6002380	6005800	ahead on the next Star Wars series and we were starting to do that.
6005800	6008820	So you were starting to make the next Star Wars?
6008820	6009820	Yeah.
6009820	6011960	You as director, filmmaker?
6011960	6013800	They wanted to do a retro movie.
6013800	6014800	I don't like that.
6014800	6019420	I like every movie, I worked very hard to make them different and make them completely
6019420	6024140	different with different planets, with different spaceships, with different, you know, to make
6024140	6025420	it new.
6025420	6027740	They decided they didn't want to use those stories.
6027740	6029260	They decided they were going to go do their own thing.
6029260	6036060	And so I decided fine, but basically I'm not going to try to, they weren't that keen to
6036060	6037060	have me involved anyway.
6037060	6039700	But at the same time, I said, I'm not going to, if I get in there, I'm just going to cause
6039700	6042540	trouble because they're not going to do what I want them to do.
6042540	6044580	So I don't have the control to do that anymore.
6044580	6046240	And all I would do is muck everything up.
6046240	6049440	Now then, let's finally return to the Obi-Wan Kenobi show.
6049440	6052440	Remember earlier when I said that the plot feels like it was written by an algorithm,
6052440	6056520	like they had this idea for the one truly emotional moment where Vader absolves Obi-Wan
6056520	6060680	of his guilt, and then just had a machine write a bunch of stuff that served no purpose
6060680	6064040	other than to get us there and fill the allotted time in the Disney Plus schedule?
6064040	6066020	Now you know why it feels that way.
6066020	6070880	The way I like to work is you try and come up with visual milestones of like, well, I'd
6070880	6073360	love to see this, and I'd love to see this, and I'd love to see this.
6073360	6074840	I'm not sure how they all connect.
6074840	6079640	And then what you do is you create visuals of things that would be great, and then you
6079640	6081760	try and find a way of linking them all.
6081760	6085440	And using this mode of analysis, you can go back and rewatch the gradual decline of any
6085440	6089280	property that covered up its failings by claiming to subvert expectations, and you'll probably
6089280	6094320	see the exact same process underneath of how they built the progressive skin suit.
6094320	6097840	We're, uh, we're not re-going over Obi-Wan again using this lens.
6097840	6099800	No thank you, you can do that on your own fucking time.
6099800	6102800	But I do want to give you one solid example from the show.
6102840	6105000	Everyone is coming their pants over Riva.
6105000	6108520	She's so complex and deep, because she didn't kill young Luke, you guys.
6108520	6112280	The truth is, no, she's confused, which only has the appearance of complexity.
6112280	6116000	And in order for us to get to this moment, where Riva is broken and has to put herself
6116000	6119820	back together again, the writers have to directly violate her established character.
6119820	6122280	That doesn't matter, only getting to the end result does.
6122280	6124600	Now compare Riva to Luke in The Empire Strikes Back.
6124600	6126400	Luke isn't confused like Riva is.
6126400	6131100	Rather, Luke's heroic traits are the cause of his downfall, and the Force itself is trying
6131100	6132200	to warn him.
6132200	6136720	Luke may enter a self-destructive spiral and hit rock bottom, but at no point does he ever
6136720	6138160	act out of character.
6138160	6142760	His loyalty, his impulsivity, and his bravery, all heroic traits, are what Vader uses to
6142760	6144120	draw him into his trap.
6144120	6145120	That's the difference.
6145120	6148160	The culmination of Luke's arc happens because of who he is.
6148160	6151880	The culmination of Riva's arc happens in spite of who she is.
6151880	6154440	But if you squint your eyes, it kind of looks the same.
6154440	6156920	So this is what Disney is going to be doing going forward.
6156920	6161120	Kenobi, and almost everything else that Disney has done since taking over Lucasfilm, is a
6161120	6163160	Star Wars homunculus.
6163160	6166800	This is the progressive skin suit, and Disney is hoping that you won't look close enough
6166800	6174260	to notice.
6174260	6177360	Of course, if you complain about any of this, you're a bigot.
6177360	6181600	It's not that you're a diehard fan who's dismayed at the cultural rot encroaching on the stuff
6181600	6182600	you grew up with.
6182600	6184780	The problem has to be you, not them.
6184780	6185780	Only kinda, though.
6185780	6188640	If the show is pro-progressive and you complain, you're the problem.
6188640	6192860	But if the show does something that progressives don't like, then it's the show's problem.
6192860	6197480	For example, back in May, when the first two episodes of Obi-Wan Kenobi dropped to an auditorium
6197480	6201440	full of devoted fans, after the initial screening, the audience took to Twitter to complain about
6201440	6202520	how triggering it was.
6202520	6206560	Remember, the show opens on Order 66, and it just so happens that the Uvalde school
6206560	6208280	shooting went down the same day.
6208280	6212400	And oh boy, the internet had no problem talking about how it was Disney's fault that they
6212400	6215980	didn't see the shooting coming and reschedule their premiere.
6215980	6216980	Trigger warning!
6216980	6218900	Had to pause and literally sob.
6218900	6219900	Huge trigger warning.
6219900	6224920	It literally starts off with the attack on Jedi younglings in their temple slash school.
6224920	6227140	What the fuck was Disney thinking?
6227140	6229520	Obi-Wan should have had trigger warnings after Uvalde.
6229520	6231060	That nearly made me vomit.
6231060	6236260	The cold open of Obi-Wan is a bunch of Jedi kids getting gunned down by stormtroopers.
6236260	6238020	And it's super fucking triggering.
6238020	6240540	And I literally can't believe they released that right now.
6240540	6244820	Hey Disney, given current events, can we add a content warning to the first episode of
6244820	6245820	Obi-Wan?
6245860	6247900	I'm too sick to my stomach just reading about it.
6247900	6251820	These people are fully grown adults who feel like shows targeted at their demographic,
6251820	6255980	you know, adults, are somehow too violent, to the point that they're protesting online.
6255980	6259660	And the violence we're talking about isn't like gratuitous gore or something.
6259660	6262540	It's people getting shot and stabbed with laser weapons.
6262540	6265220	Kids were sneaking in to see R-rated films in the 90s.
6265220	6270880	Now those same kids are soy boy adults crying that PG-13 is too much for them to handle.
6270880	6274500	Part of the progressive skin suit is rounding the corners, sanding down the bumps, making
6274500	6279100	everything appear epic but have no actual stakes because we can't let anybody get
6279100	6280420	emotionally upset.
6280420	6288240	So when a bit of the old lore filters through from the before times, when tragedies actually
6288240	6292100	happened in a narrative, these padded room zoomers can't fucking take it.
6292100	6297120	However, when actual Star Wars fans voiced their actual opinions on the actual problems
6297120	6299980	with the Obi-Wan show, doesn't matter which problem, take your pick.
6299980	6302340	I've given you over 9000 of them at this point.
6302340	6305380	Disney falls back on ol' reliable, racism.
6305380	6310460	The Star Wars fandom's racism problem, Moses Ingram, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and ongoing racist
6310460	6314700	toxicity in the Star Wars community, Ingram plays the main villain in the new Star Wars
6314700	6317720	show Obi-Wan Kenobi, a Jedi hunter named Riva.
6317720	6322460	After the series' debut, the actress, who is capital B Black, revealed on Instagram
6322460	6326140	she's been bombarded with hundreds of racism threatening messages, with one telling her
6326140	6328500	her days are numbered, and another using the N-word.
6328500	6332500	Damn, well, alright, let's head over to her Instagram and take a look.
6332500	6336140	Jesus, holy hell girl, what the fuck, why is that your avatar?
6336140	6339420	Uh, give me, give me a second, guys.
6339420	6341220	Alright, here's her Instagram video.
6341220	6343500	You suck, loser, you're a diversity hire.
6343500	6346580	Operation Get Behind the Darkies is real, JESUS CHRIST.
6346580	6349860	Ayo, Kenobi, you ain't finna run forever, white boy.
6349860	6354180	You have now been converted into the Saint George of Floydium of Star Wars.
6354180	6357020	How the fuck does an alien know Ebonics?
6357020	6360500	Yeah, this is pretty shitty.
6360500	6363460	There are hundreds of those.
6363460	6365740	Hundreds.
6365740	6371560	And I also see those of you out there who put on a cape for me, and that really does
6371560	6381880	mean the world to me, because, you know, there's nothing anybody can do about this.
6381880	6386300	There's nothing anybody can do to stop this hate.
6386300	6391720	And so I question what my purpose is, and even being here in front of you, saying that
6391720	6397280	this is happening.
6397280	6399560	I don't really know.
6399560	6403920	I don't really know.
6403920	6411440	But I think the thing that bothers me is that, like, sort of this feeling that I've had inside
6411440	6415880	of myself, which no one has told me, but this feeling of like, I just got to shut
6415880	6420520	up and take it, you know, I just kind of got to bury it.
6420520	6421940	And I'm not built like that.
6421940	6429080	So I really just wanted to come on, I think, and say thank you to the people who show up
6429080	6434440	for me in the comments and the places that I'm not gonna put myself.
6434440	6440360	And to the rest of y'all, y'all weird.
6440360	6443920	Shiva is kind of a garbage character, but Moses Ingram was pretty good in the Queen's
6443920	6444920	Gambit.
6444920	6446240	She's probably a fine person in private.
6446240	6447240	It's not her fault.
6447240	6450740	I've never really liked the idea of attacking an actor or actress just because the character
6450740	6455600	they play is evil, or worse, badly written, or worse, badly acted.
6455600	6459640	Best case scenario on the side of the angry fans, it's not Moses Ingram's fault that Star
6459640	6461820	Wars writers were looking for a diversity hire.
6461820	6462820	That's Disney's fault.
6462820	6465640	She was just taking the job she was offered, like anybody reasonable would.
6465640	6466880	You gotta chase that paper.
6466880	6469180	Personally, I think she did an okay job with what she was given.
6469180	6470980	She was just given garbage.
6470980	6475340	After her video went viral, Owen McGregor recorded his own to show his support.
6475340	6481900	This weekend, Star Wars fans made Obi-Wan Kenobi the most watched Disney Plus original
6481900	6484360	series premiere of all time.
6484360	6487380	And for that, I would say a big thank you.
6487380	6492740	And it just goes to show what this family can do when we all pull together.
6492740	6499220	However, it seems that some of the fan base from this influential fan base have decided
6499220	6505400	to attack Moses Ingram online and send her the most horrendous racist DMs.
6505400	6509640	And I heard some of them this morning and it just broke my heart.
6509640	6511460	Moses is a brilliant actor.
6511460	6513020	She's a brilliant woman.
6513020	6515340	And she's absolutely amazing in this series.
6515340	6519260	She brings so much to the series, she brings so much to the franchise.
6519260	6523220	And it just sickened me to my stomach to hear that this had been happening.
6523220	6529020	I just want to say as the leading actor in the series, as the executive producer in the
6529020	6532260	series, that we stand with Moses.
6532260	6533540	We love Moses.
6533540	6536700	Again, mostly a completely reasonable response.
6536700	6538160	Anybody who's worked on a set will tell you.
6538160	6541340	The lead actor is like the informal dad of the set family.
6541340	6543580	He's probably feeling protective of Ingram right now.
6543580	6546100	However, where he goes off the rails is at the end.
6546100	6551140	And if you're sending her bullying messages, you're no Star Wars fan in my mind.
6551140	6553980	There's no place for racism in this world.
6553980	6557020	And I totally stand with Moses.
6557020	6559780	I'm not simping for the racists here, all right?
6559780	6564820	But as objectionable as I find them, you absolutely can like Star Wars and be a racist.
6564820	6565820	They're unrelated things.
6565820	6566940	Here's a funny thing, though.
6566940	6569280	Moses Ingram's video dropped on May 31st.
6569280	6574460	But on May 22nd, five days before parts one and two of the show were released, Moses Ingram
6574460	6577260	gave this interview with The Independent, where she said,
6577260	6580940	Obi-Wan is going to bring the most diversity I think we've seen in the galaxy before.
6580940	6582020	To me, it's long overdue.
6582020	6585740	If you've got talking droids and aliens, but no people of color, it doesn't make any sense.
6585740	6586740	It's 2022, you know.
6586740	6588780	So we're just at the beginning of that change.
6588780	6591300	But I think to start that change is better than never having started.
6591300	6592820	Are you butt fucking kidding me?
6592820	6594260	What about Lando Calrissian?
6594260	6595260	Mace Windu?
6595260	6596260	Jango Fett?
6596260	6599100	Maybe the problem isn't that Star Wars lacks people of color.
6599100	6602980	It's that the new people of color being brought on aren't actually very good at their jobs.
6602980	6606320	Hell, there's new people of color being brought on that are doing pretty good jobs.
6606320	6608360	So maybe the issue isn't race.
6608360	6612620	It's no secret that, for example, Jake Lloyd's life has completely fallen apart since the
6612620	6616860	Phantom Menace, and he lays at least part of the blame at the feet of Star Wars fans
6616860	6619660	who treated him exceptionally poorly when he was a child.
6619660	6621140	And you know, fair enough.
6621140	6622540	But Lloyd's white.
6622540	6626400	Maybe you can make an argument that some parts of the Star Wars fandom is toxic.
6626400	6629220	But is that problem based on race?
6629220	6630220	Absolutely not.
6630460	6633740	Billy Dee Williams was considered the smoothest dude in the original trilogy.
6633740	6636060	That guy broke out the Colt .45 after every scene.
6636060	6641420	She's pouring a Colt .45, and we all know what that means.
6641420	6643780	You mind if I join you?
6643780	6646220	You must have read my mind.
6646220	6647420	Something like that.
6647420	6652740	I find the idea that Star Wars fans are just blanket racist really hard to buy.
6652740	6655260	It just doesn't track with reality.
6655260	6659460	Here's some classic Star Wars fans on the eve of the release of The Return of the Jedi.
6659580	6662180	All I've got to say, the Jedi have returned.
6662180	6665140	We're just fanatics out here waiting on Return of the Jedi.
6665140	6666140	Three years in the making.
6666140	6667140	We're waiting for this.
6667140	6670180	Some people don't idolize Darth Vader like I do.
6670180	6672700	See, I want him to get Luke.
6672700	6677140	And I think that Luke will destroy Darth Vader.
6677140	6678420	I guess Darth Vader will die.
6678420	6679420	I'm not sure.
6679420	6680420	I hope he doesn't.
6680420	6681420	I love his black.
6681420	6684180	I think it's surprising to see all of them together at the end playing pinochle and having
6684180	6685180	a great time.
6685180	6687860	I wish I was there, and I'm going to try to get a part of the next movie myself.
6687860	6691460	This has left me practically utterly speechless, actually, you know, but it was the best one
6691460	6692460	ever.
6692460	6696980	The big surprise was seeing Darth Vader unveil himself to his son.
6696980	6697980	It was very exciting.
6697980	6698980	The biggest surprise?
6698980	6700980	Well, I don't want to give it away to anybody.
6700980	6704180	Do you think it was worth coming to this late at night?
6704180	6705180	Yeah.
6705180	6706660	Looks like it's straight out of a KKK meeting.
6706660	6707660	Am I right, guys?
6707660	6711660	Ingram also stated, This was something that Lucasfilm actually got in front of and said,
6711660	6715020	This is a thing that unfortunately likely will happen, but we are here to help you.
6715020	6716420	You can let us know when it happens.
6716420	6718740	Disney is referring to her getting racist DMS and stuff.
6718740	6720740	They knew this was going to happen before it did.
6720740	6722460	So good faith to Disney.
6722460	6725560	Everybody should recognize that some people online are just assholes.
6725560	6726560	That's it.
6726560	6730260	They are going to say racist shit in the DMS, even if you do an amazing job.
6730260	6734820	But if Disney knows the show is going to be bad, getting ahead of it might entail spinning
6734820	6739220	up a story of racism before any such racism even happens as a defense.
6739220	6743440	Therefore, the guy who's actually in Moses Ingram's DMS being a racist and the guy who
6743440	6747480	thinks the Obi Wan show sucks and has real complaints because Disney got out ahead of
6747480	6748480	the story.
6748480	6749800	They can spin it like those two are linked.
6749800	6753400	The most cynical part of my brain thinks they might have actually planned this, like, Oh,
6753400	6755480	thank God Moses Ingram got sent racist messages.
6755480	6758800	Now we can go to Twitter and activate the woke spin cycle and generate some press for
6758800	6760520	this god awful show of ours.
6760520	6761520	And you know what?
6761520	6762520	That's exactly what they did.
6762520	6764240	Here's the official Star Wars Twitter account.
6764240	6768400	We are proud to welcome Moses Ingram to the Star Wars family, and we're excited for Reeva's
6768400	6769500	story to unfold.
6769500	6773700	If anyone intends to make her feel in any way unwelcome, we have only one thing to say
6773700	6775020	we resist.
6775020	6778760	There are more than 20 million sentient species in the Star Wars galaxy.
6778760	6780280	Don't choose to be a racist.
6780280	6781940	Make it all about the controversy guys.
6781940	6786120	Don't talk about the show's shoddy writing or middling quality or awful new characters.
6786120	6787800	Make it all about racism.
6787800	6792440	Two black female Star Wars characters, one liked and the other disliked by fans, almost
6792440	6794860	as if it is less about demographics than quality.
6794860	6797820	This is literally the I have a black friend argument.
6797820	6802340	Being racist does not just refer to donning a white hood and being overtly racist.
6802340	6806420	It also includes things like implicit bias, you can like some black characters and still
6806420	6807420	be a racist.
6807420	6808840	Man, I've never understood this.
6808840	6811800	Why would a black person still be friends with somebody who's a racist?
6811800	6814460	Why would a racist still like black characters and actors?
6814460	6818160	Where's the implicit bias when you think that Reeva fucking sucks as a villain?
6818160	6821460	You know, I'm just not willing to take any fucking guff from the company that puts this
6821460	6826400	woke virtue signaling shit out on Twitter, while at the same time actually acting overtly
6826400	6829500	racist and homophobic themselves in the overseas markets.
6829500	6833300	If you're not willing to stand up for your values, where and when it matters, when you
6833300	6837340	have something to lose, then they're not values, and I'm not going to be preached at about
6837340	6838340	them by you.
6838340	6842400	I'm certainly not going to get preached at when the same fan backlash shit happened to
6842400	6847620	Mandalorian actress Gina Carano because she was anti-ACAB during the Summer of Love 2020
6847620	6849620	and she lost her fucking job over it.
6849620	6850620	Remember that shit?
6850620	6854620	Carano did all the things that you don't do as an arm of the Star Wars corporal progressive
6854620	6855860	subversion machine.
6855860	6859900	Make jokes about masks, talk about her belief in the 2020 election fraud, don't put pronouns
6859900	6861820	in your bio, oh my god.
6861820	6865340	I think the star that finally broke the camel's back was when she compared hating people for
6865340	6869120	their political views to the persecution of Jews from the Holocaust.
6869120	6871540	And fair enough, that's pretty fucking spicy, isn't it?
6871540	6875580	But hey, how does that one poem go that leftoids always like to cite?
6875580	6877420	First they came for the socialists.
6877420	6882540	Why isn't this a case of comparing a political affiliation to the persecution of the Jews?
6882540	6885540	This is, in fact, something that people on the left always do.
6885540	6889180	Compare the persecution of leftist activists to other historical horrors.
6889180	6893240	Even though there are just as many historical horrors where leftists come after who they
6893240	6897020	deem to be counter-revolutionary or reactionary or whatever.
6897020	6901540	It's almost like, despite the obvious hyperbole of Carano's claims, the ultimate issue is
6901540	6905800	that only one political camp is allowed the privilege associated with being a victim.
6905800	6906860	But you know what?
6906860	6911180	Not only did they have no problem at all with Gia Carano before she posted any of the spicy
6911180	6915940	stuff, they actually claimed the sexist, racist, toxic fanbase that was Star Wars was
6915940	6918940	triggered when she first joined up with the franchise.
6918940	6919940	Really?
6919940	6923780	The same people who you now claim are her most ardent alt-right supporters or whatever
6923780	6924780	the fuck?
6924780	6926580	There is nothing these people wouldn't say.
6926580	6929420	No lie they wouldn't tell to further their agenda.
6929420	6931140	By the way, that alt-right thing?
6931140	6935300	It turns out that most of the complaints about The Last Jedi came from the same Twitter accounts
6935300	6939740	that were considered Russian bots and plants during the 2016 election, making them all
6939740	6940740	part of the alt-right.
6940740	6944340	Or maybe average people are just fed up with your shit, Disney.
6944340	6946100	You're alt-right if you hate Star Wars.
6946100	6947980	It's the fans' fault that Star Wars sucks.
6947980	6949340	The Force is female.
6949340	6952100	Anakin Skywalker fell because of toxic masculinity.
6952100	6954500	Watch the all-female Star Wars or you're a bigot.
6954500	6956780	If you negatively review Star Wars, you're a bigot.
6956780	6959540	Except Obi-Wan is LGBT or you're a bigot.
6959540	6961580	I swear to fucking god.
6961580	6966360	Consume product to defeat my cultural enemies regardless of its quality or my personal enjoyment
6966360	6969540	of it is the greatest marketing gimmick ever conceived.
6969540	6973540	And now they want to do the same thing they did to Gia Carano to Rosario Dawson, the actress
6973540	6978180	playing Ahsoka Tano, despite her being quite left-leaning, because at one point a trans
6978180	6984900	man filed a lawsuit against her for discrimination, verbal abuse, physical assault, and misgendering.
6984900	6986760	I guess that's illegal in California.
6986760	6990300	Even though the lawsuit was dropped because there was just nothing fucking to it, people
6990300	6992700	still want her out of the Ahsoka show.
6992700	6997500	These people are so deep down the rabbit hole that even being innocent of the crime that
6997500	6999900	they're accused of is not enough for them.
6999900	7004140	Some people are saying that Obi-Wan was purposely brought low in order to pump Riva up and that
7004140	7005220	might be the case.
7005220	7007620	That doesn't bother me the way that it does a lot of other fans.
7007620	7011740	I don't mind a story where an old hero is taken down a peg or two and has to, you know,
7011740	7012940	get his mojo back.
7012940	7014620	But it has to be justified.
7014620	7019060	And in the Obi-Wan show, one of the only things going for it is that Obi-Wan's descent is
7019060	7020380	actually pretty justified.
7020380	7022660	He's lost everything here and it's all his fault.
7022660	7026300	Compare that to The Last Jedi, where with Luke they explicitly avoid fleshing out the
7026300	7027300	justification.
7027300	7031260	Compare it to Star Trek Discovery, where the beloved character of Spock plays second fiddle
7031260	7034900	to his secret until now unknown stepsister Michael Burnham.
7034900	7038020	There are many cases where this criticism makes sense, that in order to privilege the
7038020	7041860	new characters and stories they want to tell, they just shit all over the established characters.
7041860	7043260	But that doesn't work here.
7043260	7045120	Obi-Wan's downfall is actually believable.
7045120	7048280	I just wish that it was in the service of somebody better than Riva.
7048280	7050760	The Star Wars Twitter account is always doing shit like this.
7050760	7054900	For example, for Pride Month this year, they released this comic starring two gay chicks
7054900	7055900	as bounty hunters.
7055900	7058980	Now listen, you know I have no problem with lesbians, that's some pretty good shit.
7058980	7061700	But I also have no problem with casual incidental homosexuality.
7061700	7065340	Like recently, everyone was losing their mind over the lesbian couple in the Buzz Lightyear
7065340	7066700	movie and it's like, who cares?
7066700	7068460	They're just chilling, it's whatever.
7068460	7073020	I'm even fine with a story about homosexuality specifically, where it's not just incidental
7073020	7075820	gayness, but where gayness actually drives the plot.
7075820	7080620	One of my favorite anime of all time, the 1997 masterpiece Revolutionary Girl Utena,
7080620	7084000	is a show specifically about lesbianism and gender-bending.
7084000	7088420	It is impossible to do this show's plot without the gay and queer aspects of it.
7088420	7092360	It is built from the foundation up to be that type of show, and it's done very well.
7092360	7093360	But that's the point.
7093360	7096200	Utena is designed to be that story, but Star Wars isn't.
7096200	7099560	There's nothing in the fabric of the Star Wars universe that demands queerness.
7099560	7103500	Meanwhile, this comic also isn't the incidental gayness of Lightyear either.
7103500	7107220	This is not a Star Wars story with Star Wars characters that just so happen to be gay.
7107220	7110640	This is a gay story wearing the Star Wars progressive skin suit.
7110640	7114360	So of course somebody replies with, don't make Star Wars political.
7114360	7117620	Oh, you poor brave soul, F's in the chat.
7117620	7122160	The Star Wars official Twitter account replied with, queer characters existing isn't political,
7122160	7124260	and Star Wars is literally in our name.
7124260	7128160	You know, for a political faction that talks about responsible platforming, use of social
7128160	7131960	media, punching down, a faction that I'm sure the Disney intern running the Star Wars
7131960	7136140	account is a part of, you'd think they'd know not to sic their huge following on a
7136140	7137520	smaller private account.
7137520	7139840	Though I'm sure they actually knew exactly what would happen.
7139840	7142240	Look at the fucking rage of all these replies.
7142240	7145380	Here's another one, calling all members of the Resistance, Billie Lourd and Kelly Marie
7145380	7146800	Trainor taking the stage now.
7146800	7148880	Respectfully, nobody likes either of them.
7148880	7153440	Respectfully, L plus ratio, geez, maybe the Disney intern is actually Kefls.
7153440	7156000	And the exact same thing happened to this poor bastard too.
7156000	7158800	Get his ass, get his ass, get their ass, I guess this one's inclusive.
7158800	7161500	Get his ass, get his ass, yeah, let's go, get their ass.
7161500	7166040	It's often said by left-oid screeching about right-oid YouTubers or even apolitical YouTubers
7166040	7170480	that people in positions of influence online have a moral obligation to tilt their audiences
7170480	7174840	towards good behavior and that the harassment that pours out of right-wing communities reflects
7174840	7177900	on both the politics and the individuals within those communities.
7177900	7181560	If we accept this logic, what does it say about progressive communities that individuals
7181560	7186400	within them have no problem being grotesquely racist towards black people who aren't progressive?
7186400	7189880	You know, at this point, if you're anti-BLM or something, you're a member of the actual
7189880	7190880	Resistance.
7190880	7192360	These people are a fucking monolith.
7192360	7196760	The most important type of reply out of this officially sanctioned Star Wars dogpile, though,
7196760	7199800	were the people who were claiming that Star Wars is actually political.
7199800	7204080	And yes, the left-oid answer is the everything-is-political position, stemming out of Antonio Gramsci's
7204080	7207840	theory of cultural hegemony, describing how before the working class can revolt against
7207840	7212160	the bourgeoisie, first they must be indoctrinated within an alternate culture that is pro-revolution.
7212160	7216080	The crafting of that culture requires the subversion of mass media to deconstruct morality
7216080	7220360	and heroism for the masses, and within that resulting cultural vacuum, push pro-socialist
7220360	7221360	propaganda.
7221360	7225240	If you want to know why so many new properties are garbage that promote communism and progressivism,
7225240	7229160	while so many reinventions of old properties are simply lessons in how to subvert them,
7229160	7230160	this is why.
7230160	7233440	Gramsci's time will come on this channel eventually, but for our purposes here, Star
7233440	7237640	Wars is political because when George Lucas chose to base his stories on the specific
7237640	7242080	hero myths and morals that he did, to a reader of Gramsci, that choice was not a neutral
7242080	7243080	one.
7243080	7245080	It did not exist within a political or cultural vacuum.
7245080	7249920	Rather, it led new generations of people to idolize specific types of heroes, and as those
7249920	7253800	children became politically active adults, the particular cultural morality they grew
7253800	7255000	up with informed their politics.
7255000	7261080	One of the themes of the movie is high technology and romance.
7261080	7263560	They're romantic human.
7263560	7269280	One of the human qualities is that romantic quality, that quality of honor and justice
7269280	7275440	and everything that we equate as human in the way we focus and conduct our lives.
7275440	7280520	In this particular case, I was looking for a symbol of sort of a more humane, honorable
7280520	7287120	way of being a warrior, as opposed to the mechanical, heartless, machine-like approach
7287120	7290260	to killing and battle and war.
7290260	7294800	One of the main influences here was the samurai ethic and King Arthur and the King Arthur
7294800	7300840	ethic where you have a very strong set of ethical rules that you live by.
7300840	7306860	The lightsaber became the symbol of that humane way of conducting your life.
7306860	7311080	In this way, Star Wars is political because the progs view it as a vehicle to influence
7311080	7312600	political change in the next generation.
7312600	7316760	It's not valued by them for the artistry of the thing, but only for its real-world
7316760	7317760	impact.
7317760	7319320	In other words, it's the progressive skin suit.
7319320	7323080	Probably the greatest bulwark against the Gramsciate cultural subversives is literally
7323080	7324120	voting with your wallet.
7324120	7328520	A piece of media that lacks a soul and only exists to enact political or cultural change
7328520	7330300	is generally not of high quality.
7330340	7334140	This is the source of the get woke, go broke phenomenon, but it was identified by George
7334140	7337060	Lucas as an issue long before that phrase became popular.
7337060	7340780	When Star Wars came out, everybody said, oh, it's a silly movie.
7340780	7344660	It's just a bunch of space battles and stuff.
7344660	7345900	It's not real.
7345900	7347020	There's nothing behind it.
7347020	7349140	And I said, well, there is stuff behind it.
7349140	7350740	It's not just a space battle.
7350740	7352260	There's more to it than that.
7352260	7354560	It's much, much more complicated than that.
7354560	7360880	So the spaceships and that part of the science, fantasy, whatever, got terribly abused.
7360880	7365240	And of course, everybody went out and made spaceship movies and they were all horrible
7365240	7367160	and they all lost tons of money.
7367160	7369220	And you say, well, you know, there's more to it than that.
7369220	7371320	You can't just go out and do spaceships.
7371320	7375880	Earlier, when I alluded to just how many properties beyond Star Wars have been turned into subversive
7375880	7380380	vehicles, you should be able to notice intuitively that they all went through this process.
7380380	7383480	The stripping of initial meaning, co-opting of the aesthetic, and the replacement of the
7383480	7387900	core with politics and the fans almost always react negatively, which is why the new creators
7387900	7391640	attack their fans as a last ditch effort to try and get them in line, which only exacerbates
7391640	7392640	the problem.
7392640	7396100	But with something as big as popular as Star Wars, where legitimately bad movies still
7396100	7400000	turn a profit, the get woke, go broke effect takes some time to build up.
7400000	7403920	Unlike with, for example, American comics, which are getting absolutely dominated by
7403920	7407400	Japanese manga right now, to the point that the industry is collapsing because nobody's
7407400	7408480	reading them anymore.
7408480	7411520	Star Wars started with enough of a head start that it's going to take more than your average
7411520	7413240	failure to kill off the franchise.
7413240	7416240	But we've still seen those preliminary symptoms rear their heads.
7416240	7420080	Nobody's buying the Rose Tico action figure or whatever else because nobody likes these
7420080	7421080	characters.
7421080	7423640	The days of this stuff being collectible are over.
7423640	7428760	Just a few more strokes and all of the Bubba Fett action figures on Esau will be mine.
7428760	7429760	Auction closed.
7429760	7431180	Hello, success.
7431180	7433200	But there's also a more basic truth here.
7433200	7437240	Star Wars is obviously political, and it always was, long before the Prague sunk their hooks
7437240	7438240	into it.
7438240	7441880	The Star Wars story is about civil war, rebellion against the state, religious persecution,
7441880	7445260	persecution of people with immutable traits, economics and the effects of taxation, how
7445260	7449180	populism and dismantling bureaucracy can lead to a totalitarian nightmare state, how good
7449180	7453140	people are convinced to endorse such a state, and how a crisis can be used to seize political
7453140	7456160	power under the guise of temporary emergency measures.
7456160	7459640	There is this tendency, exemplified by the you made it political quartering meme, to
7459640	7463840	view what is culturally normal as apolitical and what is abnormal as political.
7463840	7465700	And some people really take this to the extreme.
7465700	7469760	You know, I'm not sure if your average black guy just existing as a political statement,
7469760	7470760	my man.
7470800	7474640	It's also a Gramscian idea that the dominant culture isn't actually neutral, it's simply
7474640	7479080	been normalized, and that a socialist centered culture, once it's normalized, would also
7479080	7481000	appear to be neutral to those living within it.
7481000	7482240	And you know, that's probably true.
7482240	7486440	The left's point of view is, when someone says you made it political, what they're actually
7486440	7489080	saying is, you made it a type of politics that I don't like.
7489080	7490080	And you know what?
7490080	7491080	They're correct.
7491080	7492080	This is absolutely the case.
7492080	7494120	But that's not necessarily a bad thing.
7494120	7497600	If you live in a liberal culture, and you value liberalism, and you see a story, like
7497600	7501960	say, Star Wars, about a rebellion striving for liberty against an oppressive totalitarian
7501960	7503920	empire, that is a liberal story.
7503920	7505720	On the surface level, it will appear to be apolitical.
7505720	7509240	A quick examination, though, will reveal it to be absolutely political.
7509240	7513800	The true complaint here is the subversion of liberal politics is turning Star Wars into
7513800	7515240	an anti-liberal story.
7515240	7516240	And you know what?
7516240	7517520	That's a legitimate complaint, at least to me.
7517520	7522800	I have no allegiance to the anti-liberal point of view, but I do object to them taking liberal-aligned
7522800	7527400	media and subverting it, even though, when they do, their ethics almost always collapse
7527400	7528400	in on themselves.
7528400	7529560	Here, let me give you an example.
7529560	7532600	One of the best moments in the Obi-Wan show, arguably, was Frak.
7532600	7534240	It's pretty clear that Frak's a good guy.
7534240	7537400	He likes the stability that the empire's institutions bring to his life.
7537400	7540080	His banter with the stormtroopers serves to humanize them both.
7540080	7543280	Despite the empire being that totalitarian nightmare state, your average person is just
7543280	7546240	doing their job in a system they can't control, and they're just trying to get on with their
7546240	7548120	lives and do what they think is the right thing.
7548120	7553280	To them, the empire represents security, order, law, trade, jobs, and a bulwark against the
7553280	7554740	religious zealotry of the Jedi.
7554740	7556840	This dude on Twitter almost gets it.
7556840	7559880	This moment was the most real and scary Star Wars has been in a long time.
7559880	7560880	Yeah, that's the point.
7560880	7562880	Obi-Wan is a wanted man undercover.
7562880	7565160	The symbol of the empire should serve to frighten him.
7565160	7568400	But the next part of the scene, where Frak and the stormtroopers are humanized, shows
7568400	7569400	us the point.
7569400	7571360	In a different world, these guys would be friends.
7571360	7572440	But then they blow it.
7572440	7576920	That's like having a Let's Go Brandon or a Don't Tread On Me bumper sticker on a pickup.
7576920	7578760	I mean, just surface level here.
7578760	7582920	Despite some of the problems with libertarianism, the libertarian creed of Don't Tread On Me
7582920	7585480	is still the exact opposite of the empire's ethics.
7585480	7587320	But there's a bigger issue here.
7587320	7591520	These people are explicitly ignoring the point of the scene, which is humanizing Obi-Wan's
7591520	7593040	enemies before he has to kill them.
7593040	7596840	Because they don't accept the idea that their own political opponents should ever
7596840	7597840	be humanized.
7597840	7601000	I know we're digging back into history now, but remember when Ben Shapiro hosted Mean
7601000	7602500	Review on PewDiePie's channel?
7602500	7604800	Or Donald Trump went on Jimmy Kimmel's show?
7604800	7608080	Progressives were screaming bloody murder that these right-leaning people were being
7608080	7611140	humanized as if they were not already humans.
7611140	7615040	The Prague's rejection of the humanizing moment of this scene shows that they don't
7615080	7617520	actually understand the larger Star Wars conflict.
7617520	7622060	In their evaluation, there's no moral content here, only the symbols of good and evil.
7622060	7626320	If Freck was flying a Pride Month variant of the empire flag off the truck and the narrator
7626320	7630200	called the rebellion transphobes or something while Darth Vader was going around choking
7630200	7634160	out right-wingers, these idiots would do a complete 180 on this shit.
7634160	7636520	They don't want a society free of totalitarianism.
7636520	7641360	They want their ideology to be the one enforced by the totalitarian government.
7641360	7643360	In fact, okay, Star Wars is political.
7643360	7644360	I'm on board.
7644680	7646960	What kind of political is Star Wars?
7646960	7649840	That question is best answered by going back to the source.
7649840	7651800	This line in A New Hope always bothered me.
7651800	7652800	It just isn't fair.
7652800	7653800	Oh, Biggs is right.
7653800	7656760	I'm never going to get out of here.
7656760	7660920	So most people know that the Biggs that Luke is referencing is this guy who gets blown
7660920	7662500	up during the attack on the Death Star.
7662500	7665560	In the original release of the movie, he appears to be just another rebel pilot.
7665560	7670200	But in the 1997 special edition, George Lucas added back in a deleted scene showing Luke
7670200	7673400	and Biggs reuniting before the battle, where they appear to be old friends who haven't
7673440	7674440	seen each other in a while.
7674440	7675440	Hey, Luke!
7675440	7676440	Biggs!
7676440	7677440	I don't believe it!
7677440	7678440	Hey!
7678440	7679440	How are you?
7679440	7680440	Great!
7680440	7681440	How'd you get here?
7681440	7682440	Hey, you coming up last?
7682440	7683440	I'll be right up there with you.
7683440	7684440	And have I got stories to tell you?
7684440	7687440	You sure you can handle this shit?
7687440	7690440	Sir, Luke is the best pushed pilot in the Outer Rim Territories.
7690440	7692440	You'll do all right.
7692440	7693440	Thank you, sir.
7693440	7694440	I'll try.
7694440	7695440	I gotta get aboard.
7695440	7697440	We'll hear all your stories when we get back, all right?
7697440	7698440	All right.
7698440	7700440	Hey, Biggs, I told you I'd make it someday.
7700440	7702440	It'll be like old times, Luke.
7702480	7703480	They'll never stop us.
7704480	7709480	Now, the 1997 release was the one that I saw when I was a kid, but even back then, it felt
7709480	7712480	like there was some missing setup for Biggs.
7712480	7713480	And there was.
7713480	7717480	There's a long deleted scene that takes place at Toshi Station, where Luke and his
7717480	7721480	group of friends, including Biggs, use binoculars to watch the fight between the Star Destroyer
7721480	7723480	and the Counselorship at the beginning of the movie.
7723480	7727480	Afterward, Luke has a pretty interesting conversation with Biggs about the trajectory of both of
7727480	7728480	their lives.
7728520	7730520	I was so close, I thought I was going to fly in my instruments.
7730520	7732520	Otherwise, I busted up the Skyhopper pretty bad.
7732520	7733520	And I'm all in?
7733520	7734520	Furious.
7734520	7736520	He wound up grounding me for the rest of the season.
7736520	7737520	You should have been there.
7737520	7738520	It was fantastic.
7738520	7740520	You ought to take it a little easy, Luke.
7740520	7745520	You may be the hottest bush pilot this side of Mars Isley, but those little Skyhoppers
7745520	7746520	are dangerous.
7746520	7747520	Keep it up.
7747520	7751520	One day, Whammo, you're going to end up a dark spot on the downside of a canyon wall.
7751520	7752520	Look who's talking.
7752520	7755520	You've been hanging around the Starfleet so long, you've been sounding like my uncle.
7755520	7757520	You know, you're getting a little soft in the city.
7757560	7761560	I've missed you, kid.
7761560	7765560	Yeah, well, things haven't been the same without you, Biggs.
7765560	7767560	It's been so quiet.
7767560	7772560	Luke, I didn't come back just to say goodbye.
7772560	7776560	I shouldn't tell you this, but you're the only one I can trust.
7776560	7780560	See, I may never come back, and I just want someone to know.
7780560	7783560	What are you talking about?
7783600	7786600	I made some friends at the Academy.
7786600	7790600	When our frigate leaves for one of the central systems, we're going to jump ship and join
7790600	7791600	the Alliance.
7791600	7792600	The Rebellion?
7792600	7793600	Quiet down.
7793600	7794600	You've got a mouth bigger than a meteor.
7794600	7795600	I'm quiet.
7795600	7796600	I'm quiet.
7796600	7797600	Listen to how quiet I am.
7797600	7799600	You can barely hear me.
7801600	7805600	My friend has a friend on Bestine who might help us make contact.
7805600	7806600	You're crazy.
7806600	7808600	You wander around forever trying to find them.
7808600	7812600	I know it's a long shot, but if I don't find them, I'll do what I can on my own.
7812640	7814640	It's what we always talked about, Luke.
7814640	7817640	I'm not going to wait around for the Empire to draft me into service.
7817640	7821640	The Rebellion is spreading, and I want to be on the side I believe in.
7821640	7823640	Yeah, meanwhile, I'm stuck here.
7823640	7825640	You'll get your chance to get off this rock.
7825640	7827640	You're going to the Academy next term, aren't you?
7827640	7828640	Not likely.
7828640	7830640	I had to cancel my application.
7830640	7831640	What for?
7831640	7832640	My uncle needs me.
7832640	7833640	Oh.
7833640	7834640	No, I'm serious.
7834640	7835640	The Sand People have been getting really crazy.
7835640	7837640	They've even raided the outskirts of Anchor Hunt.
7837640	7838640	Come on, Luke.
7838640	7841640	Your uncle could hold off a whole colony of Sand People with one blaster.
7841680	7842680	I know.
7842680	7845680	But we've got almost enough evaporators to make the place pay off.
7845680	7847680	I have to stay one more season.
7847680	7848680	I can't leave him now.
7848680	7851680	What good's all your uncle's work if the Empire takes it over?
7851680	7855680	You know they've already started to nationalize commerce in the central systems?
7855680	7858680	It won't be long before your uncle's just a tenant,
7858680	7860680	slaving for the greater glory of the Empire.
7860680	7862680	No, that's not going to happen here.
7862680	7864680	You said yourself the Empire won't even mess with this old rock.
7864680	7865680	Things can change.
7866680	7867680	I wish I was going.
7867680	7869680	Are you going to be around long?
7869680	7870680	No.
7870720	7871720	Leaving in the morning.
7872720	7874720	I guess I won't see you.
7874720	7875720	Maybe someday.
7877720	7878720	I'll keep a look at it.
7878720	7879720	Yeah.
7879720	7882720	I'll be at the Academy next season, and then who knows?
7882720	7885720	I won't be drafted into the Imperial Starfleet, that's for sure.
7886720	7888720	Well, take it easy, buddy.
7888720	7890720	You'll always be the best friend I've ever had.
7890720	7892720	So long, Luke.
7900720	7908720	Alright, weird ass-pad aside, there's two notable things about this scene.
7908720	7912720	First is that to understand Biggs' role in Luke's life, you kind of need this scene.
7912720	7916720	Luke's later frustration at Biggs' words now makes a lot more sense.
7916720	7920720	Luke's reunion with him at the end of the movie actually carries some weight,
7920720	7922720	and Biggs' death actually means something.
7922720	7927720	I'm guessing these scenes were left out because George Lucas wanted to tightly follow R2-D2 in C-3PO
7927720	7929720	until they joined up with Luke and Obi-Wan.
7929760	7935760	The first cut of the film had the intercuts of Luke on the planet with what was going on in space,
7935760	7938760	but it just wasn't the movie I wanted to make.
7938760	7943760	I wanted to make it about this kind of odd couple and tell the story from their point of view.
7943760	7946760	But man, working them in somehow would have improved the movie quite a bit.
7946760	7949760	But secondly, there's also the political component of Biggs' speech.
7949760	7952760	Biggs states that the Empire has been nationalizing businesses,
7952760	7956760	and that the former owners of those businesses become tenants of the Empire.
7956800	7961800	His dialogue crafts a link between the idea of nationalization and the idea of landlordship,
7961800	7964800	where being a renter is the same as being a government employee,
7964800	7968800	and the thing that links them is the lack of personal ownership.
7968800	7971800	Biggs also makes it sound like it's at least somewhat common
7971800	7974800	for young people to join the Imperial Academy to get training,
7974800	7976800	and then defect the Rebellion when they get a chance.
7976800	7979800	Now, the Empire is obviously supposed to be a stand-in for Nazi Germany.
7979800	7982800	The historical stormtroopers, from which the Imperial stormtroopers get their name,
7982840	7986840	were the Brownshirts, the Nazi Party's paramilitary wing in its early years.
7986840	7991840	Demographically, the Brownshirts were overwhelmingly young working-class communist-aligned men
7991840	7994840	who believed that national socialism could be an alternate path forward
7994840	7997840	for the socialist movement instead of the communist international.
7997840	8002840	Nowadays, the idea that fascism is capitalism in decay is one that the left clings to,
8002840	8004840	despite it being resoundingly false.
8004840	8007840	A fascist totalitarian government rolling in, pointing guns at you,
8007840	8010840	and telling you that you work for them now, that's not capitalism.
8010840	8011840	In fact, that's the opposite of it.
8011880	8015880	But back in 1977, when A New Hope came out, World War II wasn't so old,
8015880	8018880	and academia hadn't yet been completely subverted,
8018880	8021880	such that multiple generations of people no longer understood how politics worked.
8021880	8025880	People back then knew that fascism was socialism in decay,
8025880	8027880	even if they didn't use that language to say it.
8027880	8030880	And this knowledge was reflected in the political undertones of the pop culture of the time.
8030880	8032880	Here, let me use another example.
8032880	8034880	I don't commonly get into Archie comics on this channel.
8034880	8038880	He's not so popular now, but he was a pretty big deal in the early post-war period.
8038920	8042920	There's a story that was printed first in 1972 called Mark My Words,
8042920	8045920	where Archie has a brand new set of markers that are stolen from him,
8045920	8047920	and then graffiti is drawn all over the school with the markers.
8047920	8050920	This was back in 72, remember? Markers were invented in 1953.
8050920	8053920	Getting a hold of them was easy enough, but they were considered specialized tools,
8053920	8056920	not something that everyone would have just lying around their house like today.
8056920	8059920	So, Principal Weatherby naturally blames Archie for the graffiti,
8059920	8063920	and then in response, the other students casually declare Weatherby a fascist.
8063920	8066920	They then say that the downtrodden rising up
8066960	8069960	would require the student body to make more and worse graffiti.
8069960	8072960	Archie stops them and says that even if he didn't do it,
8072960	8074960	suspecting him isn't unreasonable given the evidence,
8074960	8076960	and if they really wanted to help fix the situation,
8076960	8078960	they should help him clean the mess.
8078960	8082960	And it's this show of virtue that convinces the principal that Archie is actually innocent.
8082960	8086960	Now, I'm not here telling you to get your serious political analysis from Archie comics,
8086960	8089960	nor am I saying that this comic presents the true fascism or whatever.
8089960	8092960	What I am saying is, when I first read this comic,
8092960	8094960	I was surprised at the use of the term.
8095000	8099000	In today's pop media, it's so often the case that if fascism is brought up,
8099000	8102000	it's done to point fingers at the right, even the libertarian right.
8102000	8104000	But here, that's clearly not the context.
8104000	8108000	Here, it's done to point fingers at legitimate authority that has made a mistake.
8108000	8110000	And their prescription for fixing the situation
8110000	8113000	is to actually do the thing they were mistaken for doing.
8113000	8115000	The ethic this story is exemplifying for the reader
8115000	8117000	is that even in the face of injustice,
8117000	8120000	the best thing you can do is act virtuous.
8120000	8124000	The people who wrongly call Weatherby a fascist aren't rewarded for doing so.
8124040	8126040	They're vilified for exacerbating the situation.
8126040	8130040	In a more general sense, there was a broad understanding by people of this era
8130040	8133040	that socialism and fascism were feuding brothers,
8133040	8136040	and that each of their reactions to the other made society worse.
8136040	8139040	While it was liberal democracy standing apart from the two
8139040	8141040	from a totally different political school of thought
8141040	8144040	that truly had an alternative, more constructive path forward.
8144040	8148040	And this can also be seen in the political science writing of this era as well.
8148040	8150040	Before the Soviets had begun infiltrating Western universities
8150040	8152040	with their active measures program,
8152080	8154080	you had papers like, for example,
8154080	8157080	A Premature Fascist, Sorelle and Mussolini by James Meisel,
8157080	8159080	which documents the clear ideological progression
8159080	8162080	from the socialism of French syndicalist George Sorelle
8162080	8165080	to the neo-socialism and later fascism of Benito Mussolini.
8165080	8168080	With this knowledge, let's return to the cut scenes from Star Wars and New Hope.
8168080	8172080	Biggs' assertion that nationalization leads to everyone becoming tenants
8172080	8174080	where nobody truly owns their own means of production
8174080	8176080	in an exclusive individualistic manner
8176080	8178080	and the collective dictates to the individual
8178080	8180080	what is the greater good for the people.
8180120	8183120	That principle is the handshake between socialism and fascism.
8183120	8186120	Meanwhile, in the Wild West environment that is Tatooine,
8186120	8188120	with all of its many problems,
8188120	8191120	there's still ultimately more freedom there than within the empire.
8191120	8194120	The small landowners and businessmen who exclusively own property,
8194120	8197120	they're less well-off materially than the citizens of the core worlds,
8197120	8199120	but they're free, at least for now,
8199120	8200120	and they want to keep it that way.
8200120	8203120	The rebellion is a liberal individualistic uprising
8203120	8205120	against a socialist system in decay
8205120	8207120	and George Lucas wrote that story
8207120	8209120	within the context of a larger cultural backdrop
8209160	8211160	that still understood the natural progression
8211160	8213160	between a socialist revolution and a fascist state.
8213160	8216160	Now, maybe you might say that deleted scenes don't count.
8216160	8218160	They don't really represent what Star Wars is all about
8218160	8220160	because they were, you know, deleted.
8220160	8223160	And so, not only their plot points but their underlying morals
8223160	8225160	should be disregarded.
8225160	8228160	The problem is, Biggs' speech slots in quite well
8228160	8230160	to what we know about the empire's economy,
8230160	8233160	as told on screen in The Empire Strikes Back.
8233160	8235160	So you see, since we're a small operation,
8235160	8238160	we don't fall into the jurisdiction of the empire.
8238200	8240200	So you're part of the mining guild then?
8240200	8241200	No, not actually.
8241200	8243200	Our operation is small enough not to be noticed.
8243200	8246200	Fascist political theory describes what they called
8246200	8247200	a corporative economy,
8247200	8250200	where guild-like bodies, called corporations,
8250200	8253200	would bring together the managers of government-led business
8253200	8255200	and representatives from nationalized unions
8255200	8258200	to determine how best to implement state policy.
8258200	8260200	In this scene, Lando is expressing gratitude
8260200	8263200	that his business is small enough not to be nationalized
8263200	8265200	in the way that Biggs described
8265200	8267200	under the jurisdiction of the mining guild.
8267240	8268240	And later in the movie,
8268240	8271240	the empire does actually roll in and take over the business
8271240	8274240	because Han and Leia's presence shines a spotlight on them,
8274240	8275240	just like how, in reality,
8275240	8278240	fascists would march into businesses, point guns at them,
8278240	8279240	and tell them that they work for the state now.
8279240	8282240	Again, this is not capitalism in decay.
8282240	8283240	It is, in fact, state socialism.
8283240	8286240	That idea is disproven on the very first page
8286240	8288240	of the book Hitler's Beneficiaries
8288240	8290240	by German historian Goetz Ali.
8290240	8292240	Ali describes the efforts of Stuart Elliot Eisenstadt,
8292240	8294240	an American who has spent much of his life
8294240	8296240	negotiating reparations for victims of the Holocaust.
8296280	8298280	In fact, he's been the federal government special advisor
8298280	8301280	on Holocaust issues under Obama, Trump, and Biden.
8301280	8304280	Part of Eisenstadt's work involved securing compensation
8304280	8306280	from private German businesses
8306280	8308280	that profited off of Nazi slave labor.
8308280	8309280	And Ali immediately agrees
8309280	8312280	that Eisenstadt was fully in the right to pursue damages.
8312280	8313280	But despite this,
8313280	8316280	Eisenstadt's highly public negotiations with these companies,
8316280	8319280	widely publicized in the media in the 1990s and early 2000s,
8319280	8321280	led to a distorted view
8321280	8324280	of just how complicit German captains of industry were
8324280	8325280	in the horrors of the Nazi regime.
8325320	8327320	The Nazis had no problem pointing their guns
8327320	8329320	and making demands of private owners of business
8329320	8330320	if it meant getting what they want,
8330320	8333320	a fact that first came out during the Nuremberg Trials.
8333320	8336320	And while German industry is responsible for what it did,
8336320	8338320	it's also important to recognize
8338320	8340320	how little of a choice the individuals involved had.
8340320	8343320	But that nuance doesn't work very well as a headline.
8343320	8345320	And even back then, headlines are all that people read.
8345320	8347320	But none of this context would be alien
8347320	8349320	to Star Wars viewers of the 1970s or 80s
8349320	8353320	who didn't exist within a wider culture of leftist academics,
8353360	8355360	successfully subverting the knowledge
8355360	8357360	of what fascism actually is,
8357360	8359360	and replacing it with that false notion
8359360	8361360	that fascism is capitalism in decay.
8361360	8364360	So, the idea that fascism is capitalism in decay
8364360	8367360	was ultimately spread by neo-Marxist academics,
8367360	8369360	following the cultural theory of Antonio Gramsci,
8369360	8372360	who successfully dismantled our previous cultural understanding
8372360	8375360	of the links between socialism and fascism
8375360	8378360	as a part of a multi-decade project of Soviet subversion.
8378360	8380360	They then replaced that previous knowledge
8380360	8381360	with a new theory
8381400	8383400	that corporations are themselves fascist,
8383400	8386400	relying on the modern definition of the word corporation
8386400	8389400	and ignoring the very different definition from the 1920s
8389400	8391400	when Mussolini was actually writing about the corporative state
8391400	8393400	as part of fascist political theory,
8393400	8395400	and then backed up their new construction
8395400	8397400	by misinterpreting Eisenstadt's good work.
8397400	8400400	Now then, because Star Wars is political,
8400400	8402400	we can go back to the original movies
8402400	8404400	where the broad cultural understanding
8404400	8406400	of the true nature of socialism is still intact
8406400	8408400	and see that understanding shine through in the narrative.
8408400	8410400	Afterward, we can go to the newest movies
8410440	8412440	witness the end result of progressive subversion
8412440	8415440	and notice how all the ethics, all the morals, all the heroism
8415440	8417440	has been entirely flipped on its head
8417440	8419440	and how that roughly corresponds
8419440	8421440	with the loss of broader political knowledge
8421440	8423440	regarding socialism's true nature.
8423440	8425440	But, if a progressive were to hear that analysis
8425440	8427440	about how Star Wars is political,
8427440	8429440	I would be labeled a racist, bigoted, boot-licking chud
8429440	8431440	who is too stupid to understand politics
8431440	8433440	and I'm taking Star Wars too seriously and...
8433440	8435440	Don't ask questions, just consume product
8435440	8437440	and then get excited for next product.
8437440	8439440	Yeah, that.
8439440	8441440	The honest truth is, everything can be political
8441440	8443440	Prague's are right about that
8443440	8445440	but it's an active choice to politicize something.
8445440	8447440	All of these political interpretations of Star Wars
8447440	8449440	they're all valid
8449440	8451440	but you can also just shut your brain off
8451440	8453440	and watch the movie if you like.
8453440	8455440	And that's just as valid a choice
8455440	8457440	because its purpose is entertainment, not cultural change
8457440	8459440	no matter what a gramtiate might tell you.
8459440	8461440	Let's say, for example, there was a Star Wars club
8461440	8463440	at your university or something.
8463440	8465440	I don't know what you kids do nowadays.
8465440	8467440	And let's say that there was a club rule to keep politics at the door.
8467440	8469440	And let's say some whining Prague
8469440	8471440	said this rule was unfair because Star Wars is political.
8471440	8473440	The correct response is to say
8473440	8475440	maybe so, but this space isn't.
8475440	8477440	Political neutrality cannot simply be assumed anymore.
8477440	8479440	There's too many subversives in the West right now.
8479440	8481440	It has to be actively enforced
8481440	8483440	as a moral good in its own right.
8483440	8485440	And the reason it is a good
8485440	8487440	is because a neutral space is the only place
8487440	8489440	where ideas can truly be explored
8489440	8491440	where new things can truly be invented.
8491440	8493440	In a world where every space is a socialist space
8493440	8495440	it wouldn't be possible to explore ideas
8495440	8497440	beyond socialism.
8497440	8499440	Which is, by the way, the point of what they're doing.
8499440	8501440	Building the cultural hegemony that I've been talking about
8501440	8503440	for the past half hour.
8503440	8505440	If you want to know what that process looks like
8505440	8507440	all you have to do is look around.
8507440	8509440	The subversion of Star Wars
8509440	8511440	the loss of old political knowledge
8511440	8513440	for the sake of the Left's expediency
8513440	8515440	that's only one symptom among many.
8515440	8517440	The bland, grey, lifeless, algorithmic sludge
8517440	8519440	is the product of that cultural hegemony.
8519440	8521440	Where because everyone's views are enshrined
8521440	8523440	no prescriptions can be made.
8523440	8525440	Nobody can get offended.
8525440	8527440	And there is only a facsimile of emotional impact.
8527440	8529440	With this understanding, let's look at the wider culture.
8529440	8531440	Here's an advertisement from a theatre back in the day.
8531440	8533440	Compare that to this schedule from an AMC in Times Square
8533440	8535440	showing 70 different screenings of Doctor Strange.
8535440	8537440	The Contemporary Music Super Study
8537440	8539440	has shown that overall
8539440	8541440	the number one song since 2017
8541440	8543440	has been Ed Sheeran's Shape of You
8543440	8545440	every single year for the past five years.
8545440	8547440	It's funny, but that song is generic as fuck.
8547440	8549440	UMG, Warner, and Sony
8549440	8551440	control the content on Spotify.
8551440	8553440	Every alt, counterculture, rebellious song
8553440	8555440	about smashing the system or raging against the machine
8555440	8557440	is now owned by a hedge fund.
8557440	8559440	The consolidation of news media
8559440	8561440	is continuing at a breakneck pace.
8561440	8563440	The biggest upcoming films are simply rehashes
8563440	8565440	of big films from the past
8565440	8567440	and elite awards for creativity
8567440	8569440	are dominated by these rehashes.
8569440	8571440	In online streaming, niche options are gradually pruned away
8571440	8573440	and suggestions push people towards the mainstream
8573440	8575440	including platforms like Netflix
8575440	8577440	and user-generated platforms like YouTube.
8577440	8579440	In book publishing, five companies control the market.
8579440	8581440	In all creative industries
8581440	8583440	the banal word of content
8583440	8585440	is used to describe every single type of creative work
8585440	8587440	with the implication that artistry
8587440	8589440	is generic and interchangeable.
8589440	8591440	It's no longer books and movies and TV shows and video games
8591440	8593440	and YouTube videos. It's all just content
8593440	8595440	something for you to consume.
8595440	8597440	Leftoids may look at this wider state of cultural affairs
8597440	8599440	and claim this is the natural end stage of capitalism
8599440	8601440	monopolies consolidating and corporate power
8601440	8603440	and making profit to the point of destroying the market.
8603440	8605440	And fair enough, that's probably part of it.
8605440	8607440	But the issue is, this is the Left's capitalism.
8607440	8609440	The thematic elements of all of this content
8609440	8611440	as I have gone to great pains to show in this video
8611440	8613440	is radically pro-left
8613440	8615440	pro-progressive, anti-capitalist
8615440	8617440	anti-cop, pro-revolution
8617440	8619440	academia is also radically pro-left
8619440	8621440	and out of that environment comes cultural studies
8621440	8623440	where the well-educated
8623440	8625440	left-leaning ivory tower elitist
8625440	8627440	is given the job of properly interpreting culture
8627440	8629440	so that the masses may consume it
8629440	8631440	in the correct progressive approved way
8631440	8633440	in much the same way that back in the day
8633440	8635440	only priests knew Latin and could read the Bible
8635440	8637440	while commoners simply had to listen to them.
8637440	8639440	Despite the claim that the Left's ethics
8639440	8641440	is centered on supporting the working class against the bourgeoisie
8641440	8643440	the Left's elitism shows that
8643440	8645440	they desire to be the bourgeoisie
8645440	8647440	that indoctrinates the working class
8647440	8649440	in the correct way of doing politics.
8649440	8651440	The Left's cultural victory as well as their continued
8651440	8653440	insistence that they are still the counter-culture
8653440	8655440	has created a very strange monoculture
8655440	8657440	where there is no real alt-culture
8657440	8659440	where action and reaction have been
8659440	8661440	synthesized into one amalgamation
8661440	8663440	where the cultural hegemony has expanded across everything
8663440	8665440	and become a totalizing ideology
8665440	8667440	the creative world feels bankrupt
8667440	8669440	there's a sense of sameness in everything
8669440	8671440	nobody can be offended so nothing can be interesting
8671440	8673440	and this perpetual limitation is rewarded
8673440	8675440	while some alternative voices might exist
8675440	8677440	they never truly break through anymore
8677440	8679440	their cultural impact is zero
8679440	8681440	we now exist under an overarching
8681440	8683440	totalitarian cultural hegemony
8683440	8685440	that actively pushes progressive politics
8685440	8687440	into every possible space
8687440	8689440	because neutral ground is viewed as simply
8689440	8691440	another opportunity to create the next
8691440	8693440	generation of young revolutionaries
8693440	8695440	it is for this reason that Progs treat
8695440	8697440	centrists or politically disengaged people
8697440	8699440	the same way they treat those who actively
8699440	8701440	hold different politics than they do
8701440	8703440	and Star Wars, having been stripped of all of its meaning
8703440	8705440	now only exists as a tool
8705440	8707440	of this process.
8707440	8709440	You know, I think this might be the end of
8709440	8711440	Star Wars for me.
8711440	8713440	Now that I've finally done this video
8713440	8715440	I've got four hours of recorded content for this video
8715440	8717440	I know it'll be trimmed down in post
8717440	8719440	but I've been here a while. But now that I'm done
8719440	8721440	I think I've said everything that I want
8721440	8723440	to say about Star Wars. It feels like
8723440	8725440	this is my goodbye. I really liked the original trilogy
8725440	8727440	as a kid, and I was young enough to not be able to see
8727440	8729440	the glaring flaws of the prequels. It was just
8729440	8731440	fun to be along for the ride, you know? I didn't understand
8731440	8733440	that Star Wars was, at its heart, a morality
8733440	8735440	play, but that's okay. We absorb ethics
8735440	8737440	even if we don't recognize them, and that's what
8737440	8739440	subversives are hoping for. I was hopeful
8739440	8741440	yet worried with The Force Awakens. I was
8741440	8743440	flexed and disgusted with The Last Jedi, and I was
8743440	8745440	resigned with The Rise of Skywalker. The first season
8745440	8747440	of The Mandalorian was legitimately good, but then
8747440	8749440	Disney desperately hitched like ten fucking
8749440	8751440	properties to the second season and ruined it.
8751440	8753440	And at this point, with Kenobi, my
8753440	8755440	grieving process is over. The soul
8755440	8757440	of Star Wars is gone, replaced by an
8757440	8759440	algorithm. I'll probably still watch some stuff
8759440	8761440	if only to make fun of it with my friends. I'll pirate
8761440	8763440	it, of course. But Star Wars is no
8763440	8765440	longer the once-in-a-generation cultural phenomenon
8765440	8767440	that it once was. At least not to me.
8767440	8769440	And it's because of what Disney has done to it.
8769440	8771440	They've stripped out what made Star Wars
8771440	8773440	Star Wars, and replaced it with progressive activism.
8773440	8775440	And I'm just not here for that. I'm getting older.
8775440	8777440	My time on this planet is running out. All of
8777440	8779440	ours is. And I just don't want to
8779440	8781440	waste my limited attention caring about
8781440	8783440	a thing that they clearly don't care about
8783440	8785440	themselves.
8799440	8801440	If you look at my channel's release schedule,
8801440	8803440	you should probably notice that I put out a video
8803440	8805440	or I did a stream or something for every day
8805440	8807440	in July. I committed myself to once a day
8807440	8809440	on SFO for a month, and I did it.
8809440	8811440	Even if a couple videos were jokey ones, like my
8811440	8813440	editor's a communist or whatever. There was still
8813440	8815440	one piece of SFO content every day.
8815440	8817440	But even while I was doing that, I was still spending
8817440	8819440	like an hour a day working on the Kenobi review.
8819440	8821440	As the end of July approached, I only had
8821440	8823440	like half the script written. And I realized if I didn't
8823440	8825440	knuckle down and devote some real time to this video,
8825440	8827440	it was just never going to come out. At least,
8827440	8829440	not in any timely way. So you
8829440	8831440	should also notice that my release schedule in August
8831440	8833440	has been absolutely nothing at all.
8833440	8835440	TUBCASTS and Weekly Sips came out, but
8835440	8837440	beyond that, I've been pretty much radio silence.
8837440	8839440	On Discord, on Twitter, everywhere.
8839440	8841440	I've done almost nothing but work on
8841440	8843440	Kenobi this whole time. Wake up, work,
8843440	8845440	eat, sleep. For nearly two weeks
8845440	8847440	now. We're talking like 12
8847440	8849440	to 16 hour days. And as I worked,
8849440	8851440	I realized this had to be about Star Wars, not
8851440	8853440	just Kenobi. I couldn't say what I wanted to say
8853440	8855440	using only Kenobi. It had to be broader than that.
8855440	8857440	Which is why the video opens up in the second half.
8857440	8859440	It was actually pretty grueling doing something
8859440	8861440	this big, I'm not going to lie. I don't think I'm going to
8861440	8863440	attempt anything quite so in-depth
8863440	8865440	again. Not without a sponsor for the video
8865440	8867440	or I have the money to hire support staff or
8867440	8869440	something. I enjoy doing it. I don't regret
8869440	8871440	doing it. But I do feel like it's taken a little bit out of
8871440	8873440	me. Also, I highly doubt that Disney's going to let
8873440	8875440	me keep a cent of this. So if you want to support the channel,
8875440	8877440	please consider my Patreon, my SubscribeStar,
8877440	8879440	my Twitch sub button, or the YouTube membership button.
8879440	8881440	Every little bit helps and I greatly appreciate the support.
8881440	8883440	I'm going to take a short SFO vacation
8883440	8885440	now that this is out. I will return to the daily video
8885440	8887440	grind on Monday, but I think I'm just going to relax with
8887440	8889440	some video streams for the next few days.
8889440	8891440	And yeah, I'll do the Minecraft server too now that I'm
8891440	8893440	finally free from the editing dungeon. But yes,
8893440	8895440	this was the fabled Kenobi review.
8895440	8897440	I hope you enjoyed it, because if you didn't, I just tortured
8897440	8899440	myself for weeks over nothing.
8899440	8901440	I'll see you guys next time.
8901440	8903440	I love you.
