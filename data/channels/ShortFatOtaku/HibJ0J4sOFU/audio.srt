1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,960
Hey, we're back in the movie studio.

2
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:34,040
This time to talk about the newest Star Wars property, well, slightly newest.

3
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,200
The Obi-Wan Kenobi show has been done for about a month.

4
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:40,560
I figure that's enough time for the fanboys to stop soying out over it and start soying

5
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,880
out over Star Wars andor instead.

6
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:45,520
These shows seem to have a particular life cycle.

7
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,680
When the name is quietly printed at one of those corporate meetings, fans begin to rapidly

8
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:57,040
speculate.

9
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:00,320
Once the trailer drops, everyone uploads their reaction video where they're screaming and

10
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,560
crying and clapping and talking about how they've done it again.

11
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:07,200
Oh my god, it's a cultural phenomenon.

12
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,160
Then as the movie or the show or whatever actually premieres, everyone gets into a competition

13
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:15,760
on social media to see who can give Disney the deepest, most full-throated blowey they

14
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,760
can.

15
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:20,640
And then a month later, everyone finally comes to their senses and realizes, yeah, that was

16
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,640
kind of shit, wasn't it?

17
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:25,700
I've got a lot to say about the Obi-Wan Kenobi show, so it goes without saying that I'm going

18
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:27,340
to spoil pretty much everything.

19
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:32,140
Therefore, if for some ungodly reason you plan to watch this series yourself, you may

20
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:33,860
want to step away from this video.

21
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:37,460
Also, I'm very aware that multiple channels have already gone over the show in depth,

22
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:40,640
including Red Letter Media, EFAP, and It's a Gundam, and I'll try not to say the same

23
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,940
things that they do, but you know how this reviewing stuff goes sometimes.

24
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:48,100
Don't worry though, at the very least, I won't be autistically analyzing the different eras

25
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:51,700
of Darth Vader's suit to find inconsistencies in the costume.

26
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,820
Geez, Gundam, that was a bit too much even for me.

27
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,460
Oh, Vader does look like a cosplayer this time around.

28
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:01,140
Additionally, even though this video is an in-depth review of the Obi-Wan Kenobi show,

29
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:05,500
it's also a wider discussion of Star Wars as a whole, including at the end a political

30
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,500
discussion.

31
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,700
If you're not here for that, that's fine with me.

32
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:11,780
The Kenobi review ends and the meta conversation begins at about the halfway mark.

33
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:20,500
But enough goofing around, let's get this show on the road.

34
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,780
The first episode of Obi-Wan Kenobi begins with the supercut of the original trilogy,

35
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:26,880
and I gotta say, they cut the shit out of these movies.

36
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:30,380
Just to let you really young Zoomers know, the internet did actually exist 20 years ago

37
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:34,540
when the prequel trilogy came out, and forum posts and later YouTube videos of the day

38
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:37,540
considered these three movies to be dogshit.

39
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:41,620
That's all it takes for Cypher to give up his whole life in service to some evil mastermind.

40
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:45,820
Honestly, is Cypher the most easily manipulated little worm on the planet or what?

41
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:50,320
Who's going to believe that a hero, young and reckless though he may be, is simply going

42
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:55,520
to abandon his entire life and his career in a prestigious, respected order of warrior

43
00:02:55,520 --> 00:03:00,080
knights just because some evil wizard challenges his feelings of powerlessness and impotence

44
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,640
and offers him the chance that power and respect he feels he's been denied.

45
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,280
You're not all powerful.

46
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,120
Well, I should be.

47
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,240
I will be the most powerful Jedi ever.

48
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:15,520
But at the very least, people are nostalgic for them, despite or perhaps because of their

49
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,520
flaws.

50
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:19,720
I think that's why the meme of shitting on the prequels versus the sequels caught

51
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,720
on for a while.

52
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,880
People know the prequels are bad, but they love them anyway.

53
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,880
They can take a joke.

54
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:28,660
Anyway, despite these being three shitty movies, this supercut makes them look amazing.

55
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:29,660
The music's great.

56
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:32,080
They show Anakin's life and his relationship with Obi-Wan.

57
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,080
It's justâ€¦

58
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,080
Mwah.

59
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,680
It was watching this when I realized that I think I love the idea of Star Wars more

60
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,920
than the execution of Star Wars at this point.

61
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,160
There's this rich universe full of lore and characters and organizations and conflicts

62
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,680
and all this history, and then we get shit like this.

63
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:55,960
The first actual scene of the Obi-Wan show has some Jedi younglings practicing Tai Chi

64
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,960
or something.

65
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:01,680
It looks all nice and serene and then suddenly Order 66 happens and the shaky cam begins.

66
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,680
Watch it.

67
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,680
This is laughable.

68
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,160
It looks like the cameraman was pulling back and then tripped over an apple box or something.

69
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:10,400
We get to witness Jedi fighting clone troopers during that historic moment, setting up Riva

70
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,400
in the process.

71
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:15,640
Yes, I am pretty sure that everybody and their mother knew that this was Riva on their first

72
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,640
viewing.

73
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,120
It's not exactly hard to figure out what they're doing here.

74
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:22,600
There's no reason to remake the Order 66 scene when you've already flashed back to

75
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,960
the original footage, unless you're going to add some new information.

76
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:29,400
We cut to the present day, which is ten years later, approximately halfway between Revenge

77
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,640
of the Sith and A New Hope.

78
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:34,560
The setting is Tatooine, specifically a reuse of the Tatooine set from The Mandalorian and

79
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,560
Boba Fett.

80
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,560
Hey, if you've got it, why not?

81
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,900
The Inquisitors have come to town, an elite group of Force-sensitives that hunt Jedi on

82
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:41,900
behalf of the Empire.

83
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:44,620
Oh, come on, dude, why'd you have to park in the middle of the road?

84
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,420
We've got a spaceport, you know.

85
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:50,580
The Grand Inquisitor, along with Umbrella Hat Man, are both characters from Star Wars

86
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:53,660
Rebels, with established personalities and story arcs.

87
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:57,620
Fun fact, the Grand Inquisitor in that show was played by Jason Isaacs, the guy who did

88
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:02,360
both Draco's dad in Harry Potter and Captain Lorca in Star Trek Discovery, the only legitimately

89
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,260
interesting thing about that show's first season.

90
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:07,940
Upon learning that his character was heading towards the live-action screen, Jason Isaacs

91
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,820
expressed interest in playing him there, too.

92
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:11,580
But alas, we got this guy instead.

93
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:15,060
I'm sorry, I don't know him for anything, but his filmography isn't nearly as extensive

94
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:18,540
or high-profile, and I am wondering if it was a budget issue, considering Kenobi feels

95
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:19,900
kind of cheap all around.

96
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:23,300
It turns out that Kenobi only had a $90 million budget.

97
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:27,540
That's actually not that much in comparison to the $100 million for a season of The Mandalorian

98
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:33,120
or Boba Fett, or the $150 million that Moon Knight and Ms. Marvel, or the non-Disney offerings

99
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,820
of Star Trek Picard and Star Trek Strange New Worlds all commanded.

100
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:40,460
I think that's why, despite the aesthetically impressive offerings of the slum planet of

101
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:45,820
Dayu and the underwater fortress Inquisitorius, overall the Kenobi show feels rather drab.

102
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:49,540
The other locations are the beige rocks of Tatooine, the red rocks of Jabiim, the brown

103
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:53,780
rocks of the nameless planet that only exists to duel on, and the black rocks of a quarry

104
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:54,780
in California.

105
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:58,700
Multiple ships use the same cockpit set, just recolored, in an attempt to make it look like

106
00:05:58,700 --> 00:05:59,700
it's a new place.

107
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:03,560
A lack of money is the only explanation I can think of as to why the show can make some

108
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,700
things look so good and other things look so cheap.

109
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:14,740
The thing that we really aspire to constantly is quality.

110
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:18,420
Maybe they couldn't afford to take on another big name beyond Owen McGregor, and it sucks

111
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:22,420
too because Jason Isaacs is great, and, more importantly, he's got the correct shaped

112
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:23,420
head.

113
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:27,160
No, really, the Grand Inquisitor is supposed to be a member of the Pau'an race, yeah these

114
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,160
guys from episode 3.

115
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,660
With the long skinny bald heads, these effects were made with a combination of prosthetics

116
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:33,780
with a little bit of CG to add a few extra touches.

117
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:36,280
But I guess they just didn't have the budget for all that in Kenobi.

118
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:38,160
It would have looked a little bit better on Isaacs, though.

119
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,960
They're also missing the full suite of cranial ridges, no no no I'm not going to go full

120
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,200
autist like Gundam did.

121
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:47,360
This scene serves to set up the Inquisitors, what they do, the Jedi in their current situation,

122
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,620
and the conflict between Riva and the Grand Inquisitor.

123
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:52,140
But it does it just so poorly.

124
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:53,600
Why is the dialogue so stilted?

125
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,320
We should be hunting bigger prey.

126
00:06:55,320 --> 00:07:00,640
He is not yours to find, we are past this third sister, I will not warn you again.

127
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:05,520
You will forget this fixation with Kenobi or I will relieve you of your duties, is that

128
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,520
clear?

129
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,480
Why do you just grimace menacingly at the Jedi and not stop him?

130
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:13,360
Why does a fallen tarp stop the chase, literally just go the fuck around it?

131
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,240
The catching up with Obi-Wan stuff has done pretty well.

132
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,680
There's a lot of good character moments here, and they do a good job of showing, not

133
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,680
telling.

134
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,320
The drudgery of Obi-Wan's daily job, butchering a rotting sand whale, especially compared

135
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,960
to the prestige of his previous life.

136
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,520
How he appears powerless and oppressed whenever injustice happens.

137
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:32,240
How he isolates himself in a cave and has flashbacks to the pre-cultural events in his

138
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,040
dreams, even events he wasn't even present for.

139
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,840
I guess we didn't need that pre-show recap after all.

140
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:41,000
During those lonely nights Obi-Wan spends time with his anteater face, hahaha don't

141
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
look that one up.

142
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,740
But in all seriousness this is a depressed Obi-Wan, and we spend like half the episode

143
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:46,740
setting it up.

144
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:49,600
This is legitimately good stuff, even if the writing is kinda shitty.

145
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,360
You have no idea what I've been through.

146
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,320
Uh, I might have an idea dude.

147
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:57,120
We also set up the conflict between Obi-Wan and Uncle Owen, something that is only lightly

148
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,120
touched on in A New Hope.

149
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,300
I wonder if he's related to Ben.

150
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,020
That wizard's just a crazy old man.

151
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:05,620
This is a natural plotline though, that Obi-Wan would be buzzing around like a weird stalker,

152
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:07,980
while Owen just wants to get on with his life and bury the past.

153
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:10,300
It's pretty easy to feel for both of these characters.

154
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:12,580
Owen truly does want what's best for Luke.

155
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:15,420
Meanwhile Obi-Wan's clearly having PTSD just looking at the kid.

156
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:33,500
Nonetheless, these two are truly quite stupid characters.

157
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:37,700
They have private conversations about Obi-Wan being a Jedi, Luke being a Jedi, etc. in the

158
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:44,500
open fucking street.

159
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,460
Can you guys take this shit inside maybe?

160
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:52,180
Ride Obi-Wan's farting anteater back home?

161
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:56,180
Seriously this guy says rewards will be given and you're just going to drop a thank you

162
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:58,680
in the crowd?

163
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,180
You think these people won't sell you out for money?

164
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:04,860
The show then cuts to Princess Leia Organa, future leader of a very well known asteroid

165
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:05,860
belt.

166
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:09,000
They do a lot of work setting her up too, with Bail Organa returning from episode 3.

167
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,120
Her life as a princess, there's a bunch of noble family stuff in there, but it's clear

168
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:16,280
she wants no part of it, opting to spend her time running away from the palace to hang

169
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,320
out in the woods with her droid, Lola.

170
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,200
Which by the way, was an idea originally from the prequels.

171
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,080
A vision of Padme having a hovering personal droid companion was something that didn't

172
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,740
make it out of the concept stage.

173
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:30,640
Also at one point she had a falcon too, I wouldn't mind seeing falconer Leia.

174
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,400
At this point I will ask the obvious question.

175
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,760
If you're going to do an Obi-Wan story, and it's not just going to be about his shitty

176
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:39,440
life in the desert, what do you do?

177
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,320
Do you have him butt heads with Uncle Owen?

178
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:44,800
I mean of course, that's a natural extension of already established stories.

179
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,800
But what else?

180
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,600
You can't make him go have a huge adventure with Luke.

181
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:52,100
A new hope firmly establishes that Luke knows of Obi-Wan as Ben Kenobi, but they're not

182
00:09:52,100 --> 00:10:01,160
friends or acquaintances.

183
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,160
So what do you do?

184
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,920
You include a Leia storyline instead I guess.

185
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,920
And you know what?

186
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:08,600
If you skim over a new hope, you'll realize that Leia and Obi-Wan don't actually share

187
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,640
any scenes together.

188
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:13,160
While Obi-Wan is spending his time kickstarting Luke's hero's journey, Leia is on the Death

189
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,160
Star.

190
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,640
By the time Luke, Han and Chewie rescue Leia, Obi-Wan has already gone off on his own.

191
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,600
So putting them together now is perfect right?

192
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,440
Well I'm pretty sure that the only thing the people making this show did was skim the

193
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,440
old content.

194
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:28,200
Because if Leia actually went on this huge epic adventure with Obi-Wan that we see in

195
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:35,960
the show, she'd probably be reacting just like Luke does when he dies.

196
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:39,080
Does this look like a woman who's just lost a close friend and mentor?

197
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:42,880
With whom she bopped around the galaxy a decade earlier during her most formative years?

198
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,040
This is the look of somebody who's like, are you fucking kidding me, did this kid just

199
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,040
blow our cover?

200
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:52,920
Yeah dude, Leia does not give a fuck that Obi-Wan's dead.

201
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:57,160
Anyway, we need to kick off this Obi-Wan and Leia adventure that totally happened somehow.

202
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,440
So Leia gets kidnapped.

203
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,960
But not before a tense chase scene through Alderaan's woods.

204
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:07,180
And by tense I mean cartoonish.

205
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:10,260
This is the sort of thing that you'd expect to see on a Disney Kids series, where the

206
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:13,900
adults are somehow slow and incompetent, and the tiny child keeps managing to get away.

207
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:18,160
In fact, there's like four running scenes with Leia, and they all follow this formula.

208
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,540
Somehow grown ass adults just can't keep up with her.

209
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:24,680
So Leia's kidnapped, and Bail Organa wants Obi-Wan to come out of hiding at great personal

210
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,500
risk to himself, and sort it out.

211
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,820
For some reason he's not going to ask the Empire for help.

212
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:32,300
Because remember, at this point in the timeline, Organa is an Imperial Senator for a planet

213
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,300
under the protection of the Empire.

214
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:37,100
And I know the Empire is evil and all, but it still ultimately values rule of law, and

215
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:40,900
considers abducting an Imperial Senator's daughter a grave offense, as the Grand Inquisitor

216
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:45,780
will tell us next episode.

217
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:48,100
Nor does Bail consider sending out his own personal guard.

218
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:51,780
Yeah, those guys in the background with funny hats, that get completely shot up and destroyed

219
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:53,260
in A New Hope and Rogue One.

220
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:55,900
Alderaan has its own security force, he could send those.

221
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:59,460
Hell, if for some reason, Organa wanted to keep it a secret, he could call it bounty

222
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:00,460
hunters.

223
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:01,620
That's literally their job in this universe.

224
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:04,180
Hired muscle for when you don't want the authorities finding out.

225
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:06,220
No, he just wants Obi-Wan.

226
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,220
But here's why.

227
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:10,700
Only you know how important she really is, Obi-Wan.

228
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:13,180
Wait a second, how important is she?

229
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:16,300
I mean, yeah, she's Anakin's daughter, and Luke's son.

230
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,300
That's pretty important.

231
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:21,520
But only insofar as Anakin's personal feelings, and maybe some sort of succession or legitimacy

232
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,700
thing down the line?

233
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:26,580
Yes, Bail loves his daughter, but they're acting like she's a child of destiny or something.

234
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:27,860
My duty is to the boy.

235
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:31,500
What about your duty to his sister?

236
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,440
She's as important as he is.

237
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,760
There was that whole stupid prophecy thing that George Lucas invented for the prequels

238
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:41,160
about Anakin bringing balance to the force, but his kids aren't named in the prophecy.

239
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:44,840
You refer to the prophecy of the one who will bring balance to the force.

240
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,160
Also in the end, Anakin didn't bring balance to the force.

241
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:53,040
You and the chosen one bring balance to the force, not leave it in darkness.

242
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,040
I know George Lucas later confirmed in an interview that it was Luke who fulfilled the

243
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,440
prophecy in episode 6.

244
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:02,440
The prophecy is that Anakin will bring balance to the force and destroy the Sith.

245
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:07,100
He becomes Darth Vader, Darth Vader does become the hero, Darth Vader does destroy

246
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:10,440
the Sith, meaning himself and the Emperor.

247
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:13,680
He does it because he is redeemed by his son.

248
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,640
But even that didn't matter because Luke's school fell apart, and by the end of the sequel

249
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,880
trilogy there's no Jedi or Sith anymore or anything.

250
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,080
Is that what balance meant?

251
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,920
I guess everyone's equal when they're dead.

252
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:27,840
Anyway, my point is, Leia is important politically, as both the Senator's daughter and secretly

253
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,840
Anakin's daughter.

254
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,700
But insofar as Bail Organa knows, that's it.

255
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:34,500
They're treating her like she's supremely important, and yeah she is to the future movies,

256
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,500
but these guys don't know that.

257
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,460
Are they reading the fucking scripts or something?

258
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:41,900
They're even treating her as more important than Luke, who actually does become the hero,

259
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:45,780
and who Obi-Wan is all too happy to abandon his watch over to go on this adventure.

260
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:48,500
Dude, hide your lightsaber, like what the fuck?

261
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,460
The blue tunic was actually a good look on you, man, Obi-Wan should have stayed in that

262
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:52,460
the whole adventure.

263
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:56,100
Why would you dig up the old dirty Jedi robes and then just hang the lightsaber off them

264
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,100
for all to see?

265
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:00,260
Is that what secretly gives a Jedi his powers, the unwashed robes?

266
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:03,060
So, Obi-Wan arrives in the Blade Runner planet of Dio.

267
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,060
And you know what?

268
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:06,220
They did a pretty good job with the art direction here, all things considered.

269
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:09,500
There's even that nice touch of bringing back Boba Fett's actor to play an aging

270
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,800
clone trooper who's now down on his luck.

271
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,020
You can see Obi-Wan getting flashbacks as soon as he sees him.

272
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:17,140
I have a feeling that maybe the clone trooper should have recognized Obi-Wan since, you

273
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:19,420
know, Order 66, but still, this is good stuff.

274
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:21,220
We're introduced to Haja, who's a scam artist.

275
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:24,580
He pretends to be a Jedi using tricks in sleight of hand to fleece people, which again, I

276
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:25,580
don't mind.

277
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:28,140
That's the kind of person you'd find in a scum bucket city like this.

278
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:30,300
He is what passes for this story's comic relief.

279
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:34,980
And, like most comedy written by nihilistic millennials, he's only really got one note.

280
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:35,980
Being sardonic.

281
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,860
And hey, to his credit, it's sometimes funny.

282
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:40,160
But for the most part, he overstays his welcome in every scene he's in.

283
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,900
Due to the usual hijinks, Haja ends up leading Obi-Wan to the drug operation the gangsters

284
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,820
who kidnapped Leia are operating out of.

285
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:50,520
Obi-Wan is taken prisoner, he breaks out, he breaks Leia out, Leia doesn't trust him,

286
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:53,860
she runs away, he catches up, Leia doesn't trust him again, she runs away again, this

287
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:57,960
time into a rooftop firefight against a punk rocker from that dinosaur show, and a robot

288
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:07,560
who is more stiff than Hayden Christensen's acting in Attack of the Clones.

289
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:12,040
I'm really skimming over this quickly, because every scene is extremely painful and contrived.

290
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:16,160
Awful dialogue, forced chase scenes, completely counterintuitive character moments.

291
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,800
It feels like a Disney executive said to the writers, this episode needs a rooftop shootout,

292
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:23,480
a street level chase scene, a drug lab, and a cargo port, because that's what the analytics

293
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,480
say will be good.

294
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,320
Then the writing department padded it out with really bad dialogue and scenes of Alan

295
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:44,640
McGregor playing with children.

296
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:47,920
But it's not only the props and the sets and the algorithms that they're writing around,

297
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,560
but also the phenomenon that I mentioned in my Boba Fett video, that I called Cool Scene

298
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,560
Itis.

299
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,720
That final shot of the previous episode, with the lightsaber hanging off Obi-Wan's belt,

300
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,060
that's a perfect example.

301
00:15:57,060 --> 00:16:00,520
Disney wanted that trailer bait shot, something that fanboys would shed tears over in their

302
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,620
reaction videos.

303
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:05,320
Even though it's literally the dumbest fucking thing, because walking around with a lightsaber

304
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:08,800
while Inquisitors are hunting Jedi is a fast track to getting your face shoved into the

305
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,800
meat grinder.

306
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:13,920
But it looks cool, you got the iconic imagery, the swelling orchestra, Obi-Wan's back baby!

307
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,760
They're pursuing these moments at the expense of the cohesiveness of the plot.

308
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:21,200
At this point in the story it's implied that Obi-Wan's connection to the Force has

309
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:25,800
withered away along with the rest of him.

310
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,120
Leia's hanging on by a thread and Obi-Wan's in a bind.

311
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,140
Either he uses the Force or she dies.

312
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:33,880
It's that pressure cooker moment where the hero finally steps up, and of course Obi-Wan

313
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:34,880
does.

314
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,600
Wait a second though, this isn't the first time Obi-Wan used the Force in the show, is

315
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,600
it?

316
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,880
Earlier in the episode, when Obi-Wan was breaking into the drug compound, he notices

317
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,040
that the door going into the back is locked.

318
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:47,040
His plan is to cause one of the drug beakers to over boil and explode, causing a commotion,

319
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,920
upon which he pickpockets the key from the guard and slips in while everyone's distracted.

320
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:54,320
But watch the scene again, he enters from the right and then faces the front wall, where

321
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,320
the camera is.

322
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,040
It's the blue beaker behind him that explodes.

323
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,400
He doesn't adjust any knobs with his hands or anything, not that there are any knobs

324
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,400
where he is.

325
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,360
It's just a shelf of materials and some chemical canisters that aren't hooked up

326
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,360
to anything.

327
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:08,520
And with his back turned to the beaker, it blows up all on its own, which is when he

328
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,520
slips in.

329
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,520
Am I crazy?

330
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:13,960
Because this seems like he used the Force to turn a knob over on the burner, or drastically

331
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,400
heat the liquid up or something.

332
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,520
And everyone that I was watching this with took it that way too, we were all confused

333
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:22,040
like, why are they doing a big Obi-Wan has to use the Force for the first time scene?

334
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,720
Didn't we just see him use it?

335
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:28,200
Meanwhile, it's revealed that Raeva is the one who hired the thugs to kidnap Leia, specifically

336
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:31,640
for the purpose of drawing Obi-Wan out, so that she can capture him and make a name for

337
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,640
herself.

338
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,360
The other Inquisitors are outraged because, you know, the Imperial Senator's daughter

339
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,360
thing.

340
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,000
And this is when we get handed this beauty of a scene.

341
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,440
I found a link between him and Organa in the archives.

342
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,000
I used the girl as bait.

343
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,420
You hear that line?

344
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:47,860
I found a link between him and Organa in the archives.

345
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:49,980
I used the girl as bait.

346
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:50,980
That is a redub.

347
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:52,140
I should know, I do them all the time.

348
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:54,580
If you've got a sharp enough ear, you've been doing this sort of thing long enough,

349
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:55,700
it's not hard to spot.

350
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,740
Every time you set up to do voice recording, even if it's the same location, the same

351
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:02,780
microphone, the same equipment, the same people, it always sounds just slightly different.

352
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:05,420
Maybe the mic is in just a slightly different position relative to your mouth.

353
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:06,500
Maybe you're sitting differently.

354
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,460
Maybe the moisture content in the air is a little different.

355
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:12,160
Whatever the case is, no two recording sessions sound exactly alike.

356
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,260
In fact, this video is so huge, I'm doing two recording sessions on two different days

357
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,260
just to get it all done.

358
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:19,680
Let me know in the comments if you can tell when day two starts.

359
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:22,700
So listen to that scene again and really open your ears.

360
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:26,140
I found a link between him and Organa in the archives.

361
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:28,020
I used the girl as bait.

362
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:32,460
They added the line, I found a link between him and Organa in the archives in post, presumably

363
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:36,740
because they realized after shooting that there is no way anybody should know about

364
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,300
a connection between Obi-Wan and Leia.

365
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:41,180
Hell, there's no way that anyone should know that Leia's adopted at all.

366
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:44,020
You know, my father says they never let you leave this planet.

367
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:51,140
Yeah, I know, Bail's wife probably didn't appear pregnant, but you can fake that shit.

368
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:52,140
Fake records and pictures?

369
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:53,140
It's the goddamn future.

370
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:57,300
If Stalin could airbrush literally everybody out of existence, surely wifey here could

371
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,260
have been given a baby bump in a picture.

372
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:03,380
Sure, there's no automatic reason to suspect that Bail's publicly adopted daughter is

373
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:07,660
actually the believed to be dead child of Padme Amidala, but why even leave the door

374
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:08,660
open?

375
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:12,340
So what is this connection that Riva dug up from the archives that is so important that

376
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:14,700
Obi-Wan would come out of hiding to rescue Leia?

377
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:17,500
Is it that Bail, Organa, and Obi-Wan knew each other back in the day?

378
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,500
That's not really enough.

379
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,740
Bail's a senator and Obi-Wan was a Jedi Master.

380
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:24,700
There's plenty of reason that both men would know any number of other state officials or

381
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,680
military officials or other important people.

382
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,740
They had a working relationship isn't enough.

383
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:32,220
Either the archives showed an extremely tenuous circumstantial connection between Obi-Wan

384
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:36,140
and Bail, and therefore Riva should be executed on the spot by the Grand Inquisitor for taking

385
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:40,820
such an insane and stupid gambit, or the archives showed a rock solid connection between Bail

386
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:44,740
and Obi-Wan, and therefore a garrison of stormtroopers should be en route to Alderaan

387
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:48,760
immediately to extract any Jedi information from the Organa family and then send them

388
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:51,380
off to concentration camps to be turned into Soylent drinks.

389
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:55,500
But the show won't commit to either of these possibilities, because the plot simultaneously

390
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:59,780
demands them both, plausible enough to kinda act on, but not plausible enough to really

391
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:00,780
act on.

392
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:02,420
Riva does get punished for this though.

393
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:05,840
The Grand Inquisitor benches her and takes over the pursuit of Kenobi himself, so she

394
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,980
decides to go do her best Batman impression by hanging out on the rooftops of the city,

395
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,940
hoping for some reason that Obi-Wan will show up there.

396
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:13,200
And of course, he does.

397
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,340
This leads to a completely meaningless set of scenes where Riva does some very slow,

398
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:21,140
poorly choreographed Force parkour to try and get to the gunfight in time.

399
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:22,980
Which she doesn't, so whatever.

400
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:27,020
Back on the ground, Haja tells Obi-Wan to take an automated cargo transport to bypass

401
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:28,720
the Empire shutting down all the shuttles.

402
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,620
It's pre-programmed to take them to a safehouse because it turns out he's part of the Rebellion.

403
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:36,500
It's at this point that I realize that I really, really hate Leia's character.

404
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:40,860
She's simultaneously the dumb, naive kid and the wise-beyond-her-years Serene Princess

405
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:44,620
and you can't be both of those things.

406
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:45,620
Who?

407
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:46,620
Fucking Jar Jar?

408
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:50,220
Riva shows up though, so Obi-Wan stays behind to give Leia time to get to safety.

409
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:52,340
Start a counter on this one kids, it happens a lot.

410
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:54,060
So Leia runs ahead to the cargo transport.

411
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:57,700
A transport made only for cargo, not designed for humans to be in it.

412
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,900
Okay, so why are there human-sized doors?

413
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,780
And human chairs for people to sit on?

414
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:04,460
Also, why can you breathe in the ship when it goes into space?

415
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:06,300
Ah whatever, we can't worry about that too much.

416
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:34,320
We have this monumentally stupid fucking scene to watch.

417
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:50,220
So Obi-Wan knows that Anakin Skywalker is Darth Vader.

418
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:53,160
Vader does keep his real identity a secret from the wider public.

419
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:56,320
There's a lot of stories out there where he kills people he used to know or who somehow

420
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,320
found out.

421
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:01,040
It's kind of the equivalent of Vader wanting his old Anakin Twitter account buried because

422
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,520
there's some edgy shit on there and he lost the password, you know?

423
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:07,360
But Vader himself isn't a secret, he's the public face of the Empire, that's the

424
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,360
point of the guy.

425
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:12,480
Darth Vader is the name whispered by the people as a cautionary tale to not fuck with the

426
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,480
Empire.

427
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:17,120
Are you seriously telling me that after ten fucking years, word never made it back to

428
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:21,920
Obi-Wan that there's a dude in a pressure sealed burn protective suit named Darth fucking

429
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:25,120
Vader running around acting as the Empire's front man?

430
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,760
Does the newspaper just not get delivered on Tatooine or what?

431
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,840
Anyway, Riva kills the Grand Inquisitor.

432
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,360
Everyone knew he was coming back because Star Wars Rebels takes place later in the timeline

433
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,360
and he's in that show.

434
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:38,160
Though, to be honest, some people genuinely believed that Disney would violate their own

435
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,800
new canon just for the hell of it, including me for a little bit.

436
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:44,100
This did lead to some funny moments of Internet salt, the best of which probably being this

437
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,100
post on Reddit.

438
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:47,600
I'm so tired of people complaining about stupid shit.

439
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,320
Obviously, the Grand Inquisitor isn't dead.

440
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:52,080
He's in Rebels and Pow-An have two stomachs.

441
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:56,020
Oh, is that the reason why he's not dead?

442
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:57,020
Get stabbed in the stomach.

443
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:58,020
Oh, it's no problem.

444
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:59,020
You got another one.

445
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:01,320
Yeah, if you're with the spine or the aorta or any of their surrounding organs, you got

446
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,320
two stomachs, buddy.

447
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,320
Just use the other one.

448
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,280
It'll be okay.

449
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,840
Obi-Wan manages to escape onto the cargo ship with Riva waving her sword menacingly.

450
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,600
But isn't there a garrison on the planet now?

451
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,520
Surely there's Imperial ships in orbit or something.

452
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,720
All Riva has to do is call it in and they'll stop the transport.

453
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,960
Okay, we know Riva's setting this up as a double-cross invader, so maybe she won't

454
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:18,960
do it.

455
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,800
But why not Umbrella Hat Man or Reptile Hijab Lady or any of the other soldiers?

456
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,320
Maybe the Grand Inquisitor could do it.

457
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,060
You know, before Vader puts him in the bacta tank?

458
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:30,200
I have to tell you, before I pass out, my lord, Obi-Wan is on that ship.

459
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,280
And there you go, right as rain.

460
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,440
I know Hijab's explanation is that it's an automated ship, so the Empire will ignore

461
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,440
it.

462
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,440
That's kind of stupid, isn't it?

463
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,440
It's a cargo port.

464
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,440
It's fully automated.

465
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,440
They won't be looking for you there.

466
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,840
Wouldn't they just stop it just to be sure?

467
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:43,880
Well, they didn't shoot C-3PO and Archer D-2's escape pod either.

468
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:44,880
Hold your fire.

469
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,880
There's no lifeforms.

470
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:46,880
They must have short-circuited.

471
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:51,260
Maybe the Empire really is just fucking dumb when it comes to letting important ships slip

472
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:53,520
by, because censors say no one's on board.

473
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,500
But wait, Obi-Wan and Leia aren't droids.

474
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,680
They would know someone's on board.

475
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:59,340
It doesn't matter, though, because they find out where Obi-Wan went anyway.

476
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:01,820
Because Riva mind-sucked the information out of Haja.

477
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:03,300
Wait a minute.

478
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,300
Mind-suck the information?

479
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:07,660
Yeah, I know that Kylo Ren did that to Poe, and that was justified because Vader kinda

480
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:09,240
did it to Luke in Return of the Jedi.

481
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:12,980
Though that scene seemed like less of a mind-suck and more of a sensing-his-feelings sort of

482
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:13,980
thing.

483
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:18,840
But if Jedis and Siths can actually mind-suck information out of people, why didn't Vader

484
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:22,580
just do that to Leia without resorting to the drug droid in Episode 4?

485
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:25,580
After Riva got the archives, why didn't she just go to Alderaan?

486
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:26,580
Okay, it's guarded.

487
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:30,380
Wait with Bail at some official Empire function, then, and mind-suck him there to find out

488
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:31,380
where Kenobi is.

489
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:34,180
Bail clearly knows, and Riva knows he knows.

490
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:38,320
And oh boy, if she did that, wouldn't that unearth a treasure trove of information.

491
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:42,620
At this point in the timeline, not any Legends retcon shit, but Disney's own lore, Bail

492
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:46,500
Organa is the secret leader of the Rebel Alliance in the Star Wars Rebels show.

493
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:49,900
That's one big fuckin' way to blow your cover, Bail, and risk the entirety of the

494
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:53,220
Rebel Alliance by sticking your neck out towards Obi-Wan stupidly.

495
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:56,700
Also, why didn't Bail ask any of the Jedi that are part of the Rebel Alliance at this

496
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:00,180
point, including Ahsoka Tano, who is Darth Vader's former Padawan?

497
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:03,800
You know, maybe Obi-Wan would want to know that she's alive, considering their mutual

498
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,300
familial bond with Anakin.

499
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:09,820
Hell, Bail would know that Darth Vader is still around, being a Senator himself.

500
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:13,860
And though we never see it on screen, presumably he knows that Darth Vader is Anakin, since

501
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:17,100
he's present at the secret meeting at the end of Revenge of the Sith.

502
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:20,540
Why wouldn't he tell Obi-Wan, hey if you're gonna go save Leia for me, just know that

503
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:21,980
Anakin still rang around out there?

504
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:24,820
Is it because he thinks Obi-Wan won't take the job if he knows?

505
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:26,220
What an asshole.

506
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:28,260
After arriving on the planet, I don't even remember what it's called, it's just

507
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,780
the mining planet, cause fuck it.

508
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:33,100
After learning that Anakin is still alive, Obi-Wan's having PTSD visions of him off

509
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,100
in the distance.

510
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,600
Well, actually, just one vision.

511
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,600
And they never bring it up again.

512
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,540
They could have done something really cool with this idea, but they just drop it.

513
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:43,580
Instead, we get more out-of-character dialogue between Obi-Wan and Leia again, and this time

514
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:45,060
it's really weird.

515
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:48,860
This is where he told us to come to.

516
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:51,000
Maybe they're just late?

517
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Maybe it was a lie.

518
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
I knew it.

519
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
I never should have trusted him.

520
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,460
We don't know his name.

521
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:57,400
No one is coming here, Leia.

522
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,820
Holy jeez, chill out dude, you just got here.

523
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:03,280
They hitch a ride with cloaca face here when a bunch of soldiers looking for a Jedi pile

524
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,280
in.

525
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,320
Shouldn't these guys recognize Obi-Wan?

526
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:09,120
This is no ordinary Jedi.

527
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:13,280
Kenobi is the last ember of a dying age.

528
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:16,880
Surely the Empire would have told them which Jedi they're hunting out here, right?

529
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,180
Are you sure he's even on this planet?

530
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:21,500
They know what they're doing, Leia.

531
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:24,460
You called her Leia.

532
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:28,160
Oh my god, dude, they also know that Leia is missing.

533
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:32,020
This is the kind of goof up that you'd see in Spaceballs or one of the Family Guy spoof

534
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:33,020
movies.

535
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:34,580
Not in an actual Star Wars show.

536
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:38,260
Anyway, the soldiers somehow don't recognize him, and they get off at their stop, giving

537
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:40,740
us space for another Obi-Wan-Leia bonding moment.

538
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:42,740
Are you my real father?

539
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:46,340
I wish I could say I was.

540
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:50,020
Dude, is this you admitting that you wanted to fuck pad me?

541
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:53,380
That makes this scene hit different.

542
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:57,580
But our guy Freck sells him out at the next Imperial checkpoint because, I don't know,

543
00:26:57,580 --> 00:27:07,900
you talked about being a Jedi in the back seat?

544
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:11,780
All throughout this show Obi-Wan has a bad fucking habit of spilling the beans in public,

545
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:12,780
let me tell you.

546
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:15,460
Obi-Wan is asked to step out of the vehicle and he complies.

547
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:17,700
Good move dude, never fight the cops, always get your day in court.

548
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:22,140
And the scanner droid is brought in to finally face ID him with the Empire's Facebook Chinese

549
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:25,900
algorithm shit, upon which Obi-Wan blasts it in the camera, completely destroying it.

550
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:28,980
Now we all remember in the original trilogy scanner droids being incredibly weak, and

551
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:32,380
every time they show up they get downed in one shot, but they're actually not that fragile.

552
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:35,820
Yeah, there's that scene in Empire where Han takes one out in two shots, but everyone always

553
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:36,820
forgets the next line.

554
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:39,380
I didn't hit it that hard, it must have had a self-destruct.

555
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:43,000
Yeah, it purposely destroyed itself after sending information back to the Empire so

556
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,920
that the Rebellion wouldn't get any intelligence.

557
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,680
But I guess they're all just made out of paper mache now.

558
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:50,640
In probably the second most notorious fight scene in the show, because a dude gratuitously

559
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,800
falls into the laser gate and gets fucking vivisected, jesus christ, Obi-Wan takes out

560
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,800
the stormtroopers but also takes out Freck.

561
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,800
What the hell man?

562
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:01,640
Obi-Wan doesn't know that Freck sold him out, he said that quietly to the stormtroopers.

563
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,520
Look at Obi-Wan's face.

564
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,280
It could have been just a routine check, it is a checkpoint you know.

565
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:08,800
And Obi-Wan's just like, well fuck you, bonk.

566
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,120
Dude just go around it.

567
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:13,400
Just go around the laser wall, you're literally outdoors, it's a hill, go around it.

568
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:17,160
Anyway, Tala, that chick from Game of Thrones, arrives and picks up Obi-Wan after slaughtering

569
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,160
her own unit.

570
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,160
Surprise!

571
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,920
She's a mole within the Empire working for the Rebellion.

572
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:24,320
And she reveals that if Obi-Wan was just a bit more patient, none of this would have

573
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,320
happened.

574
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,320
He gave you the right coordinates.

575
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,320
I was on my way when the probes arrived but you'd already gone.

576
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,520
I hadn't expected anyone to come.

577
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,560
Oh, imagine that Obi-Wan.

578
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:35,780
Look at just how many people died because you couldn't take a breather.

579
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:36,780
Look at poor Freck.

580
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:38,860
Also, guys, you're visible on the fucking street.

581
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:40,780
Why didn't you put on stormtrooper armor?

582
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:42,300
We know it comes off easy enough.

583
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:45,300
Why didn't you suit up for this instead of running around the town square on your Jedi

584
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:47,220
robes you should have left back on Tatooine?

585
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:51,060
Tala brings them into the Jedi Underground Railroad where, stupidly, everybody who's

586
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:53,060
passed through here has written their name on the wall.

587
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:55,060
Why would you let anybody do this?

588
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:58,860
If this place is ever discovered, the Empire now has a record of everybody who survived

589
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:01,380
Order 66 and they'll be keeping an eye out for them.

590
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:05,820
But there's no way that'll ever happen.

591
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:09,740
Also, how many times are we going to get an origin story for the Rebel Alliance starbird

592
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:10,740
symbol?

593
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:13,900
It was the family crest of the noble house of Merrick, which featured prominently in

594
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,020
The Force Unleashed.

595
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:17,940
That whole storyline has been thrown into the Legends shitter, though, and replaced

596
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:23,340
with this purple-haired chick who is a Mandalorian graffiti artist who started painting phoenixes

597
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:25,540
on TIE fighters as a way of fighting the power.

598
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:27,660
Also, maybe this dude from Rogue One did it.

599
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:32,020
The wiki's not exactly clear, but the Kenobi show implies that it was actually started

600
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:35,620
as an adaptation of the symbol of the Order of the Jedi, which was a lightsaber with wings.

601
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:39,580
And after the path turned into the Rebellion, they kept an altered version of that symbol.

602
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:43,980
In fact, it looks kind of like it fell prey to the corporate dumbing down of symbols,

603
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:45,740
making it look all sleek and simplistic.

604
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:55,580
Uh, you need to run.

605
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:01,740
Run Obi-Wan, he can sense you.

606
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:05,300
Obi-Wan, you're in the safehouse of the Underground Railroad and you're lit up like

607
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:07,220
a forced Christmas tree, run.

608
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:11,140
Obi-Wan stays behind to give Leia time to get the safety, but then Tala sends Leia ahead

609
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:12,540
to go back for Obi-Wan.

610
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:15,540
Everyone's just self-sacrificing all over the place, sending the little girl off on

611
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:17,220
her own hoping that she'll make it.

612
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:18,220
And she doesn't.

613
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:19,220
Wait.

614
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:20,220
How did Riva get ahead of her?

615
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:22,280
Riva enters the tunnel that Leia goes down.

616
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,660
How did she beat her there?

617
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:26,060
Okay, let's assume that the tunnel has a branching path.

618
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:30,140
That's the path that Obi-Wan and Tala go to attend the obligatory Vader confrontation.

619
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:34,240
Leia's still ahead of Riva, so for Riva to get ahead of Leia, Leia has to double back,

620
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,600
go down the other path, let Riva get ahead and then double back again.

621
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:42,440
Or alternatively, it's just a giant labyrinth down there and therefore it was wildly irresponsible

622
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,800
to let Leia go off on her own.

623
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:10,480
Okay, okay, I get it, Obi-Wan's terrified.

624
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,920
He's not ready to face Anakin again.

625
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:16,800
But the way they shot and cut that scene is like he ran behind a pile of gravel and then

626
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:17,960
came back out the same way.

627
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:20,380
Like oops, I dropped my keys back there or something.

628
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:21,960
The duel between them is kind of lame.

629
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:24,080
Shadaversi does a great job breaking down this fight and many others.

630
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,240
She should go check that shit out.

631
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:28,060
But there's a point in this fight where we just break one of the most fundamental Star

632
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:29,060
Wars rules.

633
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:31,600
Anakin uses the force on Obi-Wan during a duel.

634
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:35,320
Now this has never been directly confirmed except in, you know, video games where the

635
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:38,120
game prevents you from doing this exact thing for this exact reason.

636
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:41,800
But it's always been under everyone's impression that Jedis and Siths didn't use the force

637
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,120
on each other directly because it would just be a waste of energy.

638
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:47,480
You'd be able to counteract it, which is why Vader always force chokes at regular people,

639
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,480
not Jedi.

640
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,000
But I guess that's just not the case anymore, so I don't know.

641
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,840
I gotta say, I do like the idea that Vader wants to torture the fuck out of Obi-Wan for

642
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:58,800
revenge and just dunks him in the fire like he's a Dunkaroo cracker going into the plastic

643
00:31:58,800 --> 00:31:59,800
cheese sauce.

644
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:04,000
When I left you, I was but a learner, now I am the master.

645
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,840
Yeah, when you learned how to burn my fucking arm off.

646
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:11,240
Then Vader extinguishes the flames with the force, which I didn't know was a power but

647
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,240
alright.

648
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:16,240
And then Tala saves the day by shooting a random stormtrooper, which isn't shoot Vader,

649
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,240
no.

650
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,900
Also, Vader doesn't somehow censor there.

651
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:22,320
And everyone reacts like they have no idea where the shot came from despite her using

652
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:25,340
a blaster, even though you can see the bright flash of light from it.

653
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:29,680
So Tala reignites the fire with the blaster, creating an impenetrable barrier between Obi-Wan

654
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:34,200
and the stormtroopers, allowing Tala's loader to scoop Obi-Wan up and carry him to safety.

655
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:38,080
Vader doesn't extinguish the flames again, the stormtroopers don't, you know, walk around

656
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,440
the huge blaze, nope, nothing.

657
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:44,560
Obi-Wan just gets away, because fuck it, I guess we're not even trying anymore.

658
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:48,920
Episode 4 opens with Obi-Wan getting dunked into the bacta tank at the rebel base on Jabiim,

659
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:53,300
where we see his hallucinations about Anakin, intercut with Anakin himself, also in a bacta

660
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:54,300
tank.

661
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:57,880
I guess he has to sit in one because of his burns, which is a nice touch, um, thematically

662
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:58,880
I mean.

663
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:02,560
Meanwhile, Leia is held captive at the fortress inquisitorious, which is first shown in the

664
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:07,680
video game Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order, which, by the way, had a much hotter sister inquisitor

665
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,680
villain.

666
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,720
I guess that's why she's the second sister in Riva's the Third.

667
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:15,040
Almost immediately during the interrogation, Leia spills the beans.

668
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:18,640
The Empire doesn't take kindly to Jedi sympathizers.

669
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,240
He will come for me.

670
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:23,520
Yep, no plausible deniability, just Obi-Wan will come for me.

671
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,260
That's it, that's the end of the Organas.

672
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:27,880
The Empire should just liquidate the entire family at this point.

673
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:31,560
And yeah, I know, Riva's actually got ulterior motives, but how about these guys?

674
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:35,160
Do you think they're not going to tell their superiors about the link between Leia and

675
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:38,280
Obi-Wan after Riva goes off the Imperial Plantation?

676
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:41,080
How in the fuck did Leia ever become a senator after this?

677
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:43,360
Wait a minute, why did Leia become a senator?

678
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:46,700
Surely that kind of job would have brought her in contact with Vader and Palpatine plenty

679
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:47,700
of times.

680
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:52,080
Wasn't the whole point that the Sith could sense the kids, so they needed to be in isolation?

681
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:56,180
Hidden, safe, the children must be kept.

682
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:59,900
We must take them somewhere where the Sith will not sense their presence.

683
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:02,180
How did Vader not sense her on the Death Star?

684
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:05,940
Once Obi-Wan wakes up, he talks to the local leader of the Rebellion in order to try and

685
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:07,600
get some help retrieving Leia.

686
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,820
Which is when Tala drops this bomb.

687
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:13,940
She knows everything, where we are, what we're doing.

688
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:14,940
Why?

689
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:19,340
Why would you entrust a ten year old kid with all of your plans like... wait, when did you

690
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:20,340
entrust her?

691
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:21,340
Was it this scene?

692
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:23,940
We have safe houses like this throughout the galaxy.

693
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:26,180
It all leads to Jabin.

694
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:29,060
From there we give them new identities and get them out.

695
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:30,860
Does it look like Leia is listening?

696
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:33,100
I don't know anything about a path.

697
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:35,820
That's actually true, Leia knows literally nothing.

698
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:38,900
Actually this whole scene, every single line, is a bomb.

699
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:41,540
You've no idea what the Empire is capable of.

700
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:45,900
These people have been fighting for years, you've been in a fucking cave this whole time,

701
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:46,900
what do you know?

702
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:49,860
But this comment prompts the leader to give an emotionally hollow speech about his dead

703
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:50,860
wife.

704
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:52,860
I had a wife once.

705
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:56,500
So I know exactly what the Empire can do.

706
00:34:56,500 --> 00:35:00,580
This guy, he goes from not helping to helping in the span of about 30 seconds.

707
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:02,700
I'm sorry, but that's not my problem.

708
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:05,460
Look, if you want my help, you got it.

709
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:10,020
In fact he talks himself into it with the dead wife speech, it's not like Obi-Wan convinces

710
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:11,020
him.

711
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:14,420
So they begin to plan the assault of the fortress inquisitorious, and I swear this episode is

712
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:15,980
the worst of the bunch.

713
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:16,980
Listen in here.

714
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:17,980
I don't see any shields.

715
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:20,360
That's because no one would be stupid enough to attack me.

716
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,460
How does that make any sense?

717
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:23,780
Isn't that the opposite of how it works?

718
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:26,740
People would be too smart to attack if it was too heavily fortified?

719
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:30,500
But wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, five years earlier in the timeline, during

720
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:35,540
Jedi Fallen Order, a game which everybody, Disney, EA, went to great lengths to ensure

721
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:40,820
is actually canon, Cal Kestis goes to the fortress inquisitorious in the exact same

722
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:45,940
way that Obi-Wan does, but this time it has shields that need to be taken down.

723
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:48,620
I've disabled the shields on the outer sections of the fortress.

724
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:50,220
I don't see any shields.

725
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:52,440
That's because no one would be stupid enough to attack me.

726
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:55,860
With the defenses they got, our usual tricks just aren't going to cut it.

727
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:57,460
I don't see any shields.

728
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:59,860
That's because no one would be stupid enough to attack me.

729
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:01,100
It's impenetrable, Wade.

730
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:02,700
I don't see any shields.

731
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:05,020
That's because no one would be stupid enough to attack me.

732
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:10,460
Somehow, some fucking how, Tala's cover is still intact, even though she, you know, gunned

733
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:15,120
down her own squad at Imperial checkpoint, and the Empire was there that same evening

734
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,120
investigating the planet.

735
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,980
I guess they just missed that.

736
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:36,660
I know that when most people watch this scene, their knee-jerk response is to say that her

737
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:41,140
bullshitting and rank pulling wouldn't work, because people do have assigned posts, and

738
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:44,560
you can't just bull your way through somebody else's command, especially in a sensitive

739
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:48,180
area like this, which are all things that you would know if you talked to anybody with

740
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:49,800
any military experience.

741
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:54,320
But to me, the more pressing problem is that when he stuck her ID rod into the computer,

742
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:58,900
a big flashing screen should have popped up telling him that her own squad was found dead

743
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:03,940
and she was missing on a planet where Obi-Wan and Leia were sighted dealing with the Rebels.

744
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:06,540
The exact same Leia that's in their basement now.

745
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:11,260
And so begins the worst infiltration in probably all of cinema history.

746
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:15,540
Palla is just hanging out around other Imperials, openly talking to Obi-Wan on the mic.

747
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:19,740
In fact, this guy even notices her, and he's like, yeah, that's kind of weird, but it's

748
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:20,980
almost time for my break.

749
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:25,280
She is, of course, discovered, upon which she goes with the officer behind a large computer

750
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:30,320
in the same room and knocks him out, again, in the same room that all the other officers

751
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,320
are doing their work in.

752
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,040
Do these guys just not hear what's going on?

753
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:37,280
Do they not think it's weird she just comes back after getting told to report to security?

754
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:40,020
This is some Metal Gear Solid level of hide-the-guard shit.

755
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:59,480
At the deepest level of the fortress, down where Riva is torturing Leia, put a big pin

756
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:03,020
in that, we'll get back to it, Obi-Wan discovers the big secret of the facility.

757
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:06,460
It's actually a tomb for all the dead Jedi from Order 66.

758
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:09,040
At least, that's what Obi-Wan assumes it is.

759
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,800
But if it is a tomb, why does it look like they're frozen in place from the moment they

760
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:12,800
died?

761
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,800
Like, look at this kid.

762
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,680
It looks like he's been time-stopped right when he got shot.

763
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:19,480
The cynical part of me wants to say that Disney is going to come out in some future show and

764
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:22,520
say, oh, those guys down there weren't dead, they were just in stasis.

765
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:26,080
That's why they all look like that, and that's how they can bring back any character they

766
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,080
want.

767
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,080
You want a Mace Windu show?

768
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,080
It's okay, they put them back together after the fall.

769
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,720
You want an Aayla Secura show?

770
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:31,900
Everyone likes blue girls.

771
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:33,280
You want a Kit Fisto show?

772
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,040
With a name like that, pair them with Aayla.

773
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:38,260
So these guys can't be in stasis, can they?

774
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:40,580
That was the whole point of carbonite freezing in Empire.

775
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:44,060
Nobody had developed the technology to put people into stasis yet, or at least technology

776
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:45,620
that would reliably work on a Jedi.

777
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:50,000
The whole middle arc of Empire, on the Imperial side anyway, was Vader trying to find a way

778
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,620
to incapacitate Luke, and he finally settled on jerry-rigging Lando's gas-refining equipment.

779
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:56,540
We only use this facility for carbon freezing.

780
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:58,020
You put him in there, it might kill him.

781
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:00,620
I do not want the Emperor's prize damaged.

782
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:04,220
We will test it on Captain Solo.

783
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:09,440
The only logical conclusion is that this place is as Obi-Wan said.

784
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,560
But if that's the case, then this scene serves no purpose in the show.

785
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,240
They don't come back here and do anything.

786
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,440
This information never comes up again.

787
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:19,520
If it's meant to show how bad the Empire is that they're turning Jedi corpses into

788
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,720
trophies, I mean, yeah, alright.

789
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:27,640
But at this point we all already know how bad the Empire is.

790
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:28,640
Yes we do, Obi-Wan.

791
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:29,840
We always have.

792
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:34,540
The scene where Obi-Wan solid snakes into the torture chamber and saves Leia is actually

793
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:35,540
great.

794
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:39,460
The idea of a Jedi using darkness to his advantage by turning off his lightsaber so you can't

795
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:40,460
see him.

796
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:41,460
You haven't seen that before and I kinda like it.

797
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:43,900
Hey, shouldn't our helmets have night vi- ahhhh!

798
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:47,660
Meanwhile, Talib breaks free from her stormtrooper guard, yeah she got caught and brought to

799
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:50,740
security a second time, by slapping him in the face.

800
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:51,820
Yes, really.

801
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:55,620
At this point, stormtrooper armor seems to make people less defended when they put it

802
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:56,620
on.

803
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:59,320
Obi-Wan's first card, getting the Darth Maul treatment, is the second most notorious

804
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,580
action scene in Kenobi.

805
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:01,820
This one is the first.

806
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:06,240
As Obi-Wan and Leia escape, he accidentally deflects a blaster bolt into the pressurized

807
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:09,480
glass, causing the weight of the ocean to breach into the hallway.

808
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:13,560
Obi-Wan tells Tala to take Leia and escape while he uses his force powers to hold the

809
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:14,560
water back.

810
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:18,160
And the show presents this like it's a great magical moment, like this is when Obi-Wan

811
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,000
finally gets his force mojo back.

812
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,400
In fact, they even set it up earlier in the episode, where Obi-Wan is struggling to spin

813
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:27,540
a fidget spinner using the force, and Tala is like, you've got PTSD.

814
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:30,980
Like this hallway scene is the big moment where Obi-Wan re-communes with the force,

815
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:32,480
but we already had this moment.

816
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,980
We had it when Obi-Wan catches Leia on Daewoo.

817
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:39,780
Their final plan is to justâ€¦ walk right through the crowd, with Leia underneath Obi-Wan's

818
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:40,780
coat.

819
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:44,500
I've seen soy boys online defend this scene, saying that Star Wars should have comedy,

820
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:45,980
and yes I completely agree.

821
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:50,220
C-3PO, R2-D2, Chewie, Anakin's banter in the same movie he becomes one of cinema's

822
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:51,220
greatest villains.

823
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:59,440
Even the more questionable choices like the Ewoks or Jar Jar, fine, Star Wars should have

824
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:00,520
moments of comedy.

825
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:05,100
But just as this scene or this scene or this scene shouldn't be a moment of comedy, neither

826
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:06,380
should this scene.

827
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:10,800
In fact, one of the main reasons that this show rapes the old lore is because it actually

828
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:14,980
turns this scene into a farce with Leia's complete non-reaction.

829
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:20,080
You have to have a specific type of anti-talent to ruin genuinely good movies and turn serious

830
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:23,200
scenes into comedic scenes with your new incompetent additions.

831
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:26,440
Like I don't even know if I can overstate just how stupid this is, and the show just

832
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,440
lets it happen.

833
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,440
No one's blinking an eye.

834
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:32,120
For some reason, nobody can tell that Obi-Wan's coat is a fucking circus tent.

835
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:34,000
Nobody's stopping them, they just waltz right out into the hangar.

836
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,400
General Obi-Wan Kenobi, years ago you snuggled me out of the Imperial base underneath your

837
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,400
trench coat.

838
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:43,600
In fact, even after Riva actually stops them, people are still going about their business.

839
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:44,600
Guys, do you mind?

840
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:45,760
We're trying to do a scene here.

841
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,200
The Rebels show up in two snowspeeders to pick them up.

842
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,840
One speeder occupies Riva, while the other picks up the gang.

843
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:53,320
I guess all three of them fit into the back of a speeder now?

844
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:55,560
Y'all know those things only hold two people, right?

845
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:56,560
One pilot, one gunner?

846
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:59,880
Did Obi-Wan, Leia, and Tala just cram themselves in the back?

847
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:02,400
Is Leia's face squished up against the glass?

848
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,380
They never show them getting in it, so I guess we're just not supposed to think about it.

849
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:10,840
After the tragic death of Wade, oh no, that guy.

850
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:14,040
I guess he's wading in the ocean now.

851
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:16,120
They return back home to the Rebel base.

852
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,120
Wait a second, though.

853
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:19,320
The fortress Inquisitorius is on the planet Nur.

854
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,760
Nur is a water world.

855
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:22,000
It's a moon of Mustafar.

856
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,040
Mustafar is the infamous lava planet where Anakin got barbecued.

857
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:28,380
But more importantly, at this point, it's the place where Darth Vader has built his

858
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:31,680
upstate cottage, for when he needs a getaway from the everyday life of running the Empire.

859
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:35,760
Yes, I know, it's symbolic, because Vader's emotionally stuck at the point where he lost

860
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,440
everything and now he's also physically stuck there, too.

861
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:39,440
Fine, fine.

862
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:43,920
But how in the holy hell do the Rebels even get into Darth Vader's personal star system

863
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:44,920
without getting noticed?

864
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:45,920
It's in the Mustafar system.

865
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:51,400
Why isn't there star destroyers or something in orbit around both Vader's castle and the

866
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,600
fortress Inquisitorius?

867
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:53,600
And how did the Rebels get away?

868
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,400
Why didn't they scramble ships?

869
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:59,700
Even if there's, somehow, nobody in orbit, you've got ships in the hangar.

870
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:02,600
Episode 5 opens with a tribute to Wade, our fallen comrade.

871
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:06,600
All right, right behind you.

872
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:07,600
Wade!

873
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:10,880
I'm actually surprised they remembered to put him in the recap.

874
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:13,920
I figured something that sullen would have weighed the episode down.

875
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:14,920
Okay, I'm done.

876
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:15,920
I'm done.

877
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:16,920
That's the last one.

878
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:19,920
This episode is interspersed with flashbacks to Attack of the Clones, from when Anakin

879
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:22,960
was a Padawan and Obi-Wan was still training him in how to fight.

880
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:24,760
Using real lightsabers, though, for some reason.

881
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:28,240
And it looks like they kinda de-aged Hayden Christensen.

882
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:29,240
Not really, you know.

883
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:32,700
It looks like they cast a 40-year-old man to play a 20-year-old and used the latest

884
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:35,320
technology to de-age him to about 35.

885
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:39,080
In fact, we know this could have been done better because somebody did do it better.

886
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:40,080
Look at these two scenes.

887
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:43,280
Disney, how do you fuck up turning on a Snapchat filter?

888
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:47,600
Flash forward to the present day, where it turns out that Riva is being made Grand Inquisitor

889
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:48,880
because of her cunning plan.

890
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:52,540
You see, it was all a ploy on her part that Obi-Wan would escape, because she put a tracker

891
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:56,440
on him, and now they'll lead the Empire back to the Rebel base, where a hacked Lola

892
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:58,040
will disable their defenses from the inside.

893
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:01,920
A plan which requires Lola to have the ability to open a maintenance hatch without touching

894
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:02,920
it.

895
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:03,920
Must be some pretty strong magnets in there.

896
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:08,200
The tracker and hacker on Lola, by the way, is one of those restraining bolts that we've

897
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:09,200
seen previously.

898
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:13,100
In A New Hope, it didn't actually alter the personalities of R2-D2 or C-3PO.

899
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:15,580
It just let them be immobilized by a remote control.

900
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:18,460
But okay, let's assume that Lola's been turned evil by a restraining bolt.

901
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:21,660
Oh, if only you had noticed the Terminator eye sooner, Leia.

902
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:22,660
Wait a minute!

903
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,520
How did Leia even get Lola back?

904
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:28,220
Lola tried to attack Riva with her micro saw blade during the interrogation scene.

905
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:30,020
That's pretty dangerous for a kid's toy, by the way.

906
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:34,900
But Riva easily subdued Lola with the Force, and immediately after took Leia to the torture

907
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:35,900
chamber.

908
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:39,000
Riva was called away by Talos' distraction, and that's when Obi-Wan does the splinter

909
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,340
cell thing to rescue her.

910
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:44,620
At this point, the only other time Riva and Leia are even in the same room is during the

911
00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:46,460
escape, where Riva is a bit preoccupied.

912
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:50,660
And it's not like anybody else knew to give the droid back to her, because Vader and the

913
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:54,860
other Inquisitors are royally pissed off until Riva explains her gambit.

914
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:56,380
And yet, Leia's got Lola.

915
00:44:56,380 --> 00:45:00,860
Either Lola flew out of Riva's pocket into the speeder on her own, off screen, or were

916
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:05,420
being asked to believe that Riva, in between the interrogation scene where she first grabbed

917
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:09,300
Lola, and the immediate march down to the torture chamber, took a side detour to mess

918
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:12,460
with the droid and then give it back to Leia, also off screen.

919
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:16,620
Disney didn't rate this show with the intention that your brain be engaged while watching

920
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:17,620
it.

921
00:45:17,620 --> 00:45:20,360
But all the Defenders online are saying, hey, you see, this show is smart.

922
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:23,420
This explains how Leia knew they were being tracked in Episode 4.

923
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:24,420
They let us go.

924
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:27,180
It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape.

925
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:28,180
Easy.

926
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:29,180
You call that easy?

927
00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:30,180
They're tracking us.

928
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:33,060
It happened to Leia as a kid, so she can see it coming as an adult.

929
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:34,060
Smart writing.

930
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:37,460
Except it's not, because this makes Obi-Wan look like a complete fucking buffoon.

931
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:41,580
Obi-Wan did the very same thing to Jango Fett in Attack of the Clones.

932
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:44,140
Why didn't he see it coming, then, like Leia did?

933
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:47,160
Lola's there, I guess, and transmitting information back to the Empire.

934
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:50,860
The Rebels are planning to evacuate, because, you know, the Imperials are closing in.

935
00:45:50,860 --> 00:45:55,540
The reason that the Anakin-Obi-Wan training flashback is even in this episode is so that

936
00:45:55,540 --> 00:45:59,580
Obi-Wan can reflect on Anakin's fighting style and use that knowledge to make this

937
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:00,580
remark.

938
00:46:00,580 --> 00:46:01,580
He'll attack next.

939
00:46:01,580 --> 00:46:02,900
He has the patience for siege.

940
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:04,060
Okay, fair enough.

941
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:08,180
But this turns out to be a completely irrelevant insight, because the Empire could just bomb

942
00:46:08,180 --> 00:46:09,180
them from orbit.

943
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:13,060
And I don't know why they don't, because their only objective is to kill everyone there.

944
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:17,120
Instead, they opt to send troops down with a huge gun, which ends up being completely

945
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:18,760
useless against the blast doors.

946
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:22,900
It's okay, though, because the blast doors get instantly shredded by Riva's lightsaber

947
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:23,900
anyway.

948
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:26,660
I guess patience for a siege wasn't necessary after all, eh, Obi-Wan?

949
00:46:26,660 --> 00:46:32,240
Hey, remember when it took Qui-Gon Jinn several minutes of stern concentration with his lightsaber

950
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:34,680
to be able to melt a hole on a blast door?

951
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:39,400
Meanwhile, Bail Organa sends a completely unnecessary, traceable, and highly sensitive

952
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:42,440
message to Obi-Wan during the midst of all this, where he says,

953
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:47,440
I know he said no communication, but your silence worries me.

954
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:54,840
If he's found you, if he's learned of the children, if I don't hear from you soon, I'll

955
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:55,840
head to Tatooine.

956
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:58,640
Owen will need help with the boy.

957
00:46:58,640 --> 00:46:59,840
Oh, smart, dude.

958
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:01,560
The fucking brain's on this guy.

959
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:05,600
I think you've been found, so I'm going to send this message with secret info in it to

960
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:06,600
you, Obi-Wan.

961
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:09,400
Let's hope the Empire doesn't find it all.

962
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:13,480
Immediately after this, Tala gives her Death Flag speech, and then Obi-Wan goes to the

963
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:17,640
blast doors to buy the others time to escape, and to confront Riva, who also gives her Death

964
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:28,560
Flag speech.

965
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:32,520
The ensuing fight consists of stormtroopers pouring into the breach made by Riva's lightsaber,

966
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:34,480
all of them missing every single shot.

967
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:38,260
Okay, so I know you're stormtroopers, but Obi-Wan's the only target for a solid 10 seconds.

968
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:39,260
How are you guys missing?

969
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:40,260
Look at this dude.

970
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:41,260
Where are you shooting?

971
00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:42,260
Obi-Wan is right there.

972
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:43,260
What are you aiming at?

973
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:47,780
Also, at this point, Disney has retconned the Force, such that we know a Jedi can stop

974
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:50,940
blaster bolts in mid-air without having to deflect anything.

975
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:53,400
Why doesn't Obi-Wan just pull a Neo and hold them back?

976
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:56,800
I mean, we are going to see him do something equivalent by the end of the series, so why

977
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:57,800
the fuck not?

978
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:01,600
The fight is ended by Tala, who sacrifices herself by way of a thermal detonator.

979
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:05,480
I don't know why she didn't just throw it, it's a grenade, she probably could have survived,

980
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:07,520
but I guess Disney is hoping that you'll care.

981
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:10,120
So the breach is sealed by Tala's sacrifice.

982
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:13,840
Wait, not really, because Obi-Wan just walks back 15 seconds later.

983
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:15,360
So why did this explosion stop the fighting?

984
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:18,400
Yeah, it killed a bunch of people, but it didn't close the hole through the blast door,

985
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:21,480
and there's clearly more stormtroopers, and you know what, whatever, I don't care anymore.

986
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:25,360
Obi-Wan decides to go right back out there to sacrifice himself again, that's two times

987
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:29,360
now in the span of two minutes, where he has another sensitive conversation out in

988
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:32,800
the open, this time with Riva about her secret plan to kill Darth Vader.

989
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:38,480
You're not bringing him to me, I'm bringing him to you.

990
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:40,680
Jesus Christ, this time they're both retarded.

991
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:44,200
Dude, the stormtroopers are right there, do you think they don't hear you plotting the

992
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:46,280
assassination of Darth fucking Vader?

993
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:49,960
And it's at this point that Riva unveils her grand plan.

994
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:53,780
Okay so let me lay this out for you, you're going to want to get a drink for this.

995
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:58,460
Riva is apparently one of the many Jedi who survived Order 66 as a youngling, right?

996
00:48:58,460 --> 00:49:01,480
Afterward she devoted herself to hunting and killing Darth Vader.

997
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:04,220
Her plan was to become an Inquisitor, get close to Vader, and then knife him in the

998
00:49:04,220 --> 00:49:05,220
back.

999
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:08,820
At the start of the series we're told that Riva has a weird obsession with finding Obi-Wan

1000
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:09,820
Kenobi.

1001
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:12,920
Everyone else has given up the hunt and they find Riva's obsession to be a bit off-putting.

1002
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:14,740
Great way for her to blow her cover, but whatever.

1003
00:49:14,740 --> 00:49:18,420
Riva's plan is to, okay I gotta keep it together here.

1004
00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:24,420
Riva's plan is to hire drug dealers on the slum planet of Diu to fly to Alderaan, a prosperous

1005
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:29,920
core world, bypass all of their security, kidnap Princess Leia, daughter of an Imperial

1006
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:31,420
Senator and the Queen of the planet.

1007
00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:34,260
Wait a second, I thought Leia was a princess because Padme was Queen of Naboo.

1008
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:37,020
Oh but I guess that had to be kept secret because nobody's supposed to know about

1009
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:38,180
the Leia-Padme connection.

1010
00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:42,540
In retrospect it kind of feels like in episode 1 the only reason Padme is a queen is to hint

1011
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:46,420
at the future relationship with Anakin where their daughter turns out to be a princess.

1012
00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:49,860
But by episode 3 George Lucas realized this was supposed to be a secret so I guess she's

1013
00:49:49,860 --> 00:49:51,620
got two queen mothers now.

1014
00:49:51,620 --> 00:49:54,180
Jesus the fuckery that is Star Wars is getting to me.

1015
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:58,620
Riva's plan, okay hire the Diu drug dealers to kidnap Leia off the heavily fortified world

1016
00:49:58,620 --> 00:49:59,620
of Alderaan.

1017
00:49:59,620 --> 00:50:03,940
Then she hopes that Bail Organa calls up Obi-Wan for help rather than using any of his other

1018
00:50:03,940 --> 00:50:05,360
resources at his disposal.

1019
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:10,540
Because according to the fabled archive files Bail Organa knows where Obi-Wan is and rather

1020
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:14,660
than just extract that information out of him Riva would rather Obi-Wan resurface on

1021
00:50:14,660 --> 00:50:15,660
his own.

1022
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:17,700
If Obi-Wan takes the bait Riva will apprehend him.

1023
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:20,080
Or at least that's what she tells the other Inquisitors.

1024
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:25,180
Her actual plan, her actual plan is to get Obi-Wan in front of Vader so that he will

1025
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:27,300
be distracted enough that she can kill him.

1026
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:31,620
And when the first attempt to do that plan fails on Diu the second plan is to just do

1027
00:50:31,620 --> 00:50:34,580
the exact same thing again at the fortress Inquisitorius.

1028
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:38,700
And when that plan fails the third plan is to do the exact same thing again at the Rebel

1029
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:39,700
base.

1030
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:42,820
Only this time the plan really fails because Darth Vader is fucking Darth Vader.

1031
00:50:45,660 --> 00:50:53,540
He was wise to use you against me.

1032
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:54,540
Yeah that.

1033
00:50:54,540 --> 00:50:58,900
So Leia fixes the hangar doors in time, Obi-Wan slips away from the stormtroopers, Haja accidentally

1034
00:50:58,900 --> 00:51:01,580
drops Obi-Wan's secret message from Bail Organa.

1035
00:51:01,580 --> 00:51:04,620
Yeah Haja is here too when he had the message, don't worry it's really not important.

1036
00:51:04,620 --> 00:51:06,660
And everybody piles into the transport ready to go.

1037
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:10,180
Vader arrives just in time to pull the transport back with the force.

1038
00:51:10,180 --> 00:51:14,920
And it's at this point everybody and I mean everybody gave up on this fucking show.

1039
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:19,240
If this is what the force can do now, why does Vader even bother with the lightsaber

1040
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:20,240
shit?

1041
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:22,640
Why doesn't he just pop people's heads like that one chick from the boys?

1042
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:26,520
When he had Obi-Wan strung up why not just immediately dismember him?

1043
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:27,520
Fuck it.

1044
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:30,160
Why didn't Vader just slam Luke into the carbonite freezer?

1045
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:34,120
Hell why didn't Vader hold back the Millennium Falcon, an empire?

1046
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:37,260
When the force is this strong it breaks the fucking canon.

1047
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:40,920
People were complaining about Starkiller pulling star destroyers out of orbit and force unleashed

1048
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:41,920
back in the day.

1049
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:46,920
And rightfully so, they made that game non-canon, but they brought back its most egregious component

1050
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:48,680
because fuck me I guess.

1051
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:52,680
But it's all okay because it was a fake ship and the real one gets away immediately

1052
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:53,680
after.

1053
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:55,160
Why doesn't Vader just hold back that one too?

1054
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:57,180
This is the same problem with that fire extinguisher scene.

1055
00:51:57,180 --> 00:52:01,160
They establish a rule, an expectation in the viewer's mind of what can be done.

1056
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:04,860
And then they immediately violate it in the same scene because they've written themselves

1057
00:52:04,860 --> 00:52:05,860
into a corner.

1058
00:52:05,860 --> 00:52:08,280
Also, how did the Rebels know that Vader would do that?

1059
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:12,880
Is that another one of Obi-Wan's off-screen nuggets of wisdom based on Vader's personality?

1060
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:16,540
Or maybe Obi-Wan went on that When Disney World ride where Vader holds a ship back so

1061
00:52:16,540 --> 00:52:17,540
he knows what's coming.

1062
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:19,640
Also, where is that second ship?

1063
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:22,760
Seriously you can't see it when the first ship flies off.

1064
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:23,760
Is it this?

1065
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:25,520
This blurry blob deep in the background?

1066
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:26,920
Is that the ship they're all on?

1067
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:28,560
It's a hell of a lot bigger when it takes off.

1068
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:30,920
Also, there's a star destroyer in orbit.

1069
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:35,200
I hope they don't just let the ship get away again like on Dayu to the mining planet

1070
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:38,560
or the mining planet to the rebel base or leaving the fortress inquisitorious.

1071
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:42,120
It really feels like the Empire is severely undermanned in this show.

1072
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:45,460
Like they've got maybe a couple dozen guys at best to do all of this shit.

1073
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:48,560
The confrontation between Riva and Vader is actually really interesting.

1074
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:52,400
Where Riva is just hopelessly outmatched to the point that Vader doesn't even draw his

1075
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:53,400
lightsaber.

1076
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:55,360
He simply blocks her attacks with the force.

1077
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:57,720
It's a new way of fighting we haven't really seen before in Star Wars.

1078
00:52:57,720 --> 00:52:58,920
It almost feels like martial arts.

1079
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:03,320
But then the fight immediately dive bombs into what I can only describe as a Dark Souls

1080
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:04,320
role fight.

1081
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:07,140
Seriously, that's the only way to describe what Riva is doing here.

1082
00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:10,840
Was the original plan for Riva to do some kind of Capoeira shit and the actress just

1083
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:13,520
couldn't pull the moves off so it came out looking like this?

1084
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:15,260
Why would you leave this farce in?

1085
00:53:15,260 --> 00:53:17,280
Of course, the Grand Inquisitor is still alive.

1086
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:20,160
He survived getting stabbed in the gut just like Riva did as a child.

1087
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:22,880
Oh, and just like Riva did again as an adult.

1088
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:25,100
How many stomachs does Riva have, guys?

1089
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:27,440
And of course, they just leave her to bleed out.

1090
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:29,960
Riva manages to find the message that Haja dropped.

1091
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:32,800
It's damaged, but she fixes it enough to hear part of the message.

1092
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:37,960
If you've learned of the children, I'll hand them Tatooine.

1093
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:42,760
Owen, help the boy.

1094
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:48,280
Because Riva had that run-in with Uncle Owen in the first episode, when she hears that

1095
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:52,340
message that Bail Organa totally should not have sent, she recognizes that there's some

1096
00:53:52,340 --> 00:53:56,160
sort of connection between Owen, specifically his son, and the Organa family.

1097
00:53:56,160 --> 00:54:00,280
So she somehow manages to make her way to Tatooine, while wounded, and without any sort

1098
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:01,280
of interstellar transport.

1099
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:02,280
The Rebels have already left.

1100
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:03,280
The Imperials are gone.

1101
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:04,680
How the hell did she get off this rock?

1102
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:05,680
Are you okay?

1103
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:07,560
I just sensed a plot hole.

1104
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:11,400
Word gets back to Uncle Owen that an Inquisitor is coming, and the Lars family decides the

1105
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:14,520
best course of action isn't to skip town, go lay low.

1106
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:16,880
No, Aunt Beru wants to stand and fight.

1107
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:17,880
We need to leave, Beru.

1108
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:19,880
We need to take Luke and hide somewhere.

1109
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:20,880
Where?

1110
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:21,880
In the desert?

1111
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:23,280
I'm not leaving my home.

1112
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:24,800
At least here we have a chance.

1113
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:29,000
Remember, these guys don't know that Riva is injured and working alone and without the

1114
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,160
institutional backing of the Imperial State.

1115
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:34,040
Also, they know they're holding onto a child of destiny.

1116
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:36,800
I know it's stupid, but the show's acting this way, so let's just roll with it at this

1117
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:37,800
point.

1118
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:38,880
So surely they must have a plan.

1119
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:40,760
If the Empire ever came knocking.

1120
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:43,280
But nope, the plan is just castle doctrine.

1121
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:45,800
Get some rifles and fight them off from inside your own house.

1122
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:47,560
These people are fucking stupid.

1123
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:51,960
I expected this show to rape and butcher the characters of Obi-Wan and Darth Vader, but

1124
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:53,520
not Aunt fucking Beru.

1125
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:57,040
Obi-Wan stays behind to sacrifice himself and let the Rebels get away again.

1126
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:59,120
But this time, the gambit shouldn't work.

1127
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:01,720
The Empire is pursuing the Rebel ship and a Star Destroyer.

1128
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:05,340
You have more than enough resources to split them here and pursue both.

1129
00:55:05,340 --> 00:55:08,440
My lord, we must continue our pursuit of the insurgents.

1130
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:14,320
Now is our chance to wipe out this network in its entirety.

1131
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:18,480
We cannot prioritize one lone Jedi.

1132
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:22,680
He is not just any Jedi.

1133
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:23,680
Follow Kenobi.

1134
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:26,000
At once, Lord Vader.

1135
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,000
And you know, I get it.

1136
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:30,320
You're showing that Vader is obsessed with Obi-Wan and it's blinding him.

1137
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:32,840
But look at the Grand Inquisitor's face in this scene.

1138
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:36,560
This is the look you make when you know that your boss just made the biggest mistake of

1139
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:37,560
his career.

1140
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:39,720
But you can't say anything because if you do, he'll fire you.

1141
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:44,100
It doesn't even make sense because when they arrive at the obligatory deserted dueling

1142
00:55:44,100 --> 00:55:46,560
planet, Vader takes his personal shuttle down.

1143
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:49,140
These shuttles are capable of going into hyperdrive.

1144
00:55:49,140 --> 00:55:52,840
There's no reason Vader couldn't have taken his shuttle to pursue Obi-Wan and left the

1145
00:55:52,840 --> 00:56:00,700
pursuit of the rebels in the hands of the Grand Inquisitor on the Star Destroyer.

1146
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:03,720
Have you come to destroy me, Obi-Wan?

1147
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:05,480
Dude, you followed me here.

1148
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:08,520
Yeah, we're heading into the confrontation with Vader, which I know this show's been

1149
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:09,520
building up to.

1150
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:13,160
But it kind of deflates the emotional impact of their reuniting in A New Hope, doesn't

1151
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:14,160
it?

1152
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:15,160
I sense something.

1153
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:19,480
A presence I've not felt since Obi-Wan blasted my mask off nine years ago.

1154
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:23,200
And so begins the culmination of the emotional arc of the entire season, where Obi-Wan has

1155
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:27,120
faced his fears, he's got his mojo back, and he's ready to finally confront Vader.

1156
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:28,520
The fight is, again, actually pretty good.

1157
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:48,320
The music is even okay.

1158
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:51,600
So I have no idea why they didn't use Battle of the Heroes for Episode 3.

1159
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:53,560
The callback would be incredible, wouldn't it?

1160
00:56:53,560 --> 00:57:18,240
Like here, just check out the same scene with Episode 3's music.

1161
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:19,400
Isn't that fucking incredible?

1162
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:23,600
While all this is going on, Riva sneaks onto the Lars homestead under the cover of darkness,

1163
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:26,600
and immediately reveals herself by igniting her lightsaber.

1164
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:29,900
Uncle Owen, now knowing where she is, takes a shot.

1165
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:30,900
And misses.

1166
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:32,900
Jesus, what a comedy of errors.

1167
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:44,600
Uncle Owen does get one badass moment, though, with this exchange with Riva.

1168
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:46,160
You know, gotta hand it to the guy.

1169
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:47,920
He's fighting an Inquisitor with a pipe.

1170
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:52,640
But unfortunately for Riva, Luke does what they all should have done hours ago, run into

1171
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:54,640
the desert.

1172
00:57:54,640 --> 00:58:01,120
Meanwhile, back where the audience's focus and care actually resides, the Obi-Wan vs

1173
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:02,960
Anakin rematch is picking up the pace.

1174
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:04,500
A bit too much, actually.

1175
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:08,360
That really seems to be what's at the core of the cool-scene-itis problem with Disney's

1176
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:09,360
Star Wars.

1177
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:13,360
Even when they have a legitimately good idea, they turn it up so much it becomes entirely

1178
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:14,360
unbelievable.

1179
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:15,360
Check this bit out.

1180
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:20,200
Vader force throws a rock into Obi-Wan's leg so hard that the rock shatters and Obi-Wan

1181
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:21,200
goes down.

1182
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:23,800
Now, Obi-Wan shouldn't be getting up from that.

1183
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:26,080
That liquefied his fucking ankle, dude.

1184
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:31,680
Vader goes on to bury him in more rocks, while dropping the blandest possible one-liner.

1185
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:35,840
You have failed, master.

1186
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:36,840
Come on, man.

1187
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:40,640
At least say something like, I actually do have the high ground at Obi-Wan, would you

1188
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:41,640
look at that?

1189
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:45,280
Obi-Wan manages to hold out underneath the rock pile by creepily thinking of Luke and

1190
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:46,280
Leia.

1191
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:49,080
And this is clearly meant to be the moment where Obi-Wan is inspired by those who he

1192
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:50,960
has to protect to get his mojo back.

1193
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:51,960
For the 15th time.

1194
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:56,320
So Obi-Wan pulls himself out of the hole and oh come the fuck on.

1195
00:58:56,320 --> 00:59:00,600
Remember when master fucking Yoda had to struggle to move just a few rocks?

1196
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:04,100
Remember when lifting an X-wing out of the swamp was considered the maximum extent of

1197
00:59:04,100 --> 00:59:05,640
force levitation powers?

1198
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:09,700
Putting these kind of concrete restrictions on the use of the force makes Jedi more interesting.

1199
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:13,660
Because while they can do things others can't and they are extremely special, they're not

1200
00:59:13,660 --> 00:59:18,020
overpowered, they don't break the story, and therefore even a good Jedi can be overcome

1201
00:59:18,020 --> 00:59:19,780
if you come at the problem from the right angle.

1202
00:59:19,780 --> 00:59:22,780
That's the point of the Mandalorians and their anti-Jedi weaponry.

1203
00:59:22,780 --> 00:59:26,220
That's the point of Order 66 and overwhelming them with sheer numbers.

1204
00:59:26,220 --> 00:59:29,980
But if Obi-Wan can actually act as a one-man artillery unit, then fuck it dude, just go

1205
00:59:29,980 --> 00:59:30,980
home.

1206
00:59:30,980 --> 00:59:33,340
Why didn't he cause the mountain to collapse and all of his clone troopers?

1207
00:59:33,340 --> 00:59:36,780
Because the prequels, for all of their faults, weren't this stupid.

1208
00:59:36,860 --> 00:59:40,860
Obi-Wan strikes the decisive blow on Vader's helmet, dramatically revealing his scarred face.

1209
00:59:40,860 --> 00:59:44,140
His voice in this scene is a mixture of Anakin and Vader's, which is a nice touch.

1210
00:59:44,140 --> 00:59:46,140
Anakin's gone.

1211
00:59:46,140 --> 00:59:51,660
I am what remains.

1212
00:59:51,660 --> 00:59:55,580
The way the shots are framed, where you get that close-up of Anakin's disfigured, vulnerable

1213
00:59:55,580 --> 00:59:59,980
face beneath the terror-inducing Vader mask, how the scene is only lit by the glow of their

1214
00:59:59,980 --> 01:00:04,140
lightsabers, how Anakin's face flashes with 50 different emotions after Obi-Wan apologizes

1215
01:00:04,140 --> 01:00:05,140
to him.

1216
01:00:05,140 --> 01:00:06,940
Obi-Wan is a money shot at the entire show.

1217
01:00:06,940 --> 01:00:09,860
Every character moment has pushed Obi-Wan towards letting go of his guilt.

1218
01:00:09,860 --> 01:00:17,940
And when Obi-Wan says, I'm sorry Anakin, for all of it, he's taking responsibility.

1219
01:00:17,940 --> 01:00:21,020
Not just for what he did to Anakin in their fight, but for how he failed Anakin, for what

1220
01:00:21,020 --> 01:00:22,020
Anakin became.

1221
01:00:22,020 --> 01:00:25,940
Obi-Wan is saying, even for the things that he's not responsible for, he's sorry that

1222
01:00:25,940 --> 01:00:27,500
things turned out how they did.

1223
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:30,860
And Anakin, in a way, absolves him of all that responsibility.

1224
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:35,300
That tiny flash of an evil smile shows Obi-Wan that Anakin actually likes who he's become.

1225
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:40,060
I am absolutely convinced that this is the scene the writers base this entire show around.

1226
01:00:40,060 --> 01:00:41,540
The ultimate case of cool-scene-itis.

1227
01:00:41,540 --> 01:00:46,180
Dude, wouldn't it be fucking cool if Obi-Wan re-encountered Vader and learned just how

1228
01:00:46,180 --> 01:00:47,180
much of a monster he's become?

1229
01:00:47,180 --> 01:00:48,400
Yeah, it would be.

1230
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:50,480
But you need a narrative that supports that journey.

1231
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:54,380
You need a well-crafted story that will pick Obi-Wan up out of the desert where we left

1232
01:00:54,380 --> 01:00:58,300
him at the end of Episode 3, have that cool scene in a way that doesn't break the lore,

1233
01:00:58,300 --> 01:01:01,140
and then put him back down where he is in time for Episode 4.

1234
01:01:01,140 --> 01:01:02,140
And this show?

1235
01:01:02,140 --> 01:01:03,300
This show ain't that.

1236
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:07,140
That's why so many things happen at the end, for absolutely no reason at all, other than

1237
01:01:07,140 --> 01:01:10,460
the fact that we need to reset the game board in time for a new hope.

1238
01:01:10,460 --> 01:01:12,140
Obi-Wan has Vader beaten here.

1239
01:01:12,140 --> 01:01:13,860
It's over, and he just walks away.

1240
01:01:13,860 --> 01:01:14,860
Why?

1241
01:01:14,860 --> 01:01:15,860
Why are you leaving?

1242
01:01:15,860 --> 01:01:19,680
You even admit that Anakin is dead to you now, so why not make him actually dead?

1243
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:24,700
At this point, Obi-Wan knows he's seen what kind of monster Vader is, and he still lets

1244
01:01:24,700 --> 01:01:25,700
him live.

1245
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:28,060
To go on to, for example, blow up Alderaan.

1246
01:01:28,060 --> 01:01:29,940
Yeah, Obi-Wan, those millions of voices?

1247
01:01:29,940 --> 01:01:31,420
That's your fault now, buddy.

1248
01:01:31,420 --> 01:01:34,820
You just fucked up the homeworld of that little girl you apparently have a special bond with.

1249
01:01:34,820 --> 01:01:35,860
But that's okay, right?

1250
01:01:35,860 --> 01:01:39,060
Now you would think that we would end the show on the resolution of the most important

1251
01:01:39,060 --> 01:01:40,060
arc.

1252
01:01:40,060 --> 01:01:41,060
But no.

1253
01:01:41,060 --> 01:01:44,380
After Vader is beaten, Riva is still playing grab-ass in the desert with Luke.

1254
01:01:44,380 --> 01:01:45,860
Your father's lightsaber.

1255
01:01:45,860 --> 01:01:47,540
Yeah, I know.

1256
01:01:47,540 --> 01:01:51,100
Riva attacked my house ten years ago while you were off on an adventure with my sister.

1257
01:01:51,100 --> 01:01:52,820
Luke falls or something and gets knocked out.

1258
01:01:52,820 --> 01:01:53,820
I don't know.

1259
01:01:53,820 --> 01:01:56,620
I'm writing this part of the script at like 3am and I can't be arsed to go back and

1260
01:01:56,620 --> 01:01:57,620
check.

1261
01:01:58,180 --> 01:01:59,540
Riva is only able to catch up and get her revenge.

1262
01:01:59,540 --> 01:02:00,540
But she can't.

1263
01:02:00,540 --> 01:02:02,860
She sees herself in Luke and she just can't do it.

1264
01:02:02,860 --> 01:02:04,700
This is why everyone loves Riva, you guys.

1265
01:02:04,700 --> 01:02:05,700
She's just confused.

1266
01:02:05,700 --> 01:02:08,340
She's redeemed because she didn't kill the plot armor character.

1267
01:02:08,340 --> 01:02:10,140
And that is a load of horseshit.

1268
01:02:10,140 --> 01:02:12,540
What about all the other people Riva has killed?

1269
01:02:12,540 --> 01:02:14,700
What about all the other shit she's done over the years?

1270
01:02:14,700 --> 01:02:16,980
What about one-armed Sally back in Mos Eisley?

1271
01:02:16,980 --> 01:02:19,100
You think she's ever going to be able to masturbate normally again?

1272
01:02:19,100 --> 01:02:22,580
Doesn't she have some kind of moral consideration too, even though she's not a main character?

1273
01:02:22,580 --> 01:02:23,760
Hell, what about Leia?

1274
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:27,680
Why wasn't she having PTSD flashbacks preventing her from torturing Leia?

1275
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:30,320
It was only getting called away that stopped her in the end.

1276
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:33,320
Did she just critically fail her willpower role when it came to Luke?

1277
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:36,900
Here's what people don't seem to understand nowadays about a good redemption arc.

1278
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:40,980
If Darth Vader had survived the Empire's fall, he would have been put on trial for

1279
01:02:40,980 --> 01:02:43,320
war crimes, regardless of his redemption.

1280
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:47,560
Now if he's actually redeemed, he also would have accepted that fate and gone to his death

1281
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:48,560
peacefully.

1282
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:52,240
But the point is, suddenly saying, I'm the good guy now, even if you mean it, doesn't

1283
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:53,480
absolve you of what you did.

1284
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:56,280
That's the beginning point of the journey, not the end.

1285
01:02:56,280 --> 01:03:00,320
So when Riva walks back to the Owen family home, carrying an unconscious Luke, Obi-Wan

1286
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:03,300
â€“ yeah, he made it back to Tatooine just in time for the action, the Star Destroyer

1287
01:03:03,300 --> 01:03:06,440
in orbit gave him no trouble because of course it didn't â€“ Obi-Wan should immediately

1288
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:10,240
stick his lightsaber to her forehead and turn it on, but he doesn't because she's redeemed

1289
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:11,780
and she made the right choice.

1290
01:03:11,780 --> 01:03:15,480
And because, I'm guessing, Disney's hoping to parlay this appearance into a Riva spin-off

1291
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:16,480
show.

1292
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:19,240
The obligatory reset button scene pretends it's a character moment, but it's not.

1293
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:22,320
It's here to restore the status quo and not disrupt the lore.

1294
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:25,780
Though considering all the plot holes that is bitched about for over an hour, there's

1295
01:03:25,780 --> 01:03:29,160
no way one scene will repair all the damage the show has caused.

1296
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:45,900
But here is their attempt.

1297
01:03:45,900 --> 01:03:49,580
Even though it's already common knowledge, among the many stormtroopers and inquisitors

1298
01:03:49,580 --> 01:03:53,540
who saw it, the story ends with Obi-Wan deciding to move on with his life.

1299
01:03:53,540 --> 01:03:57,540
Even though we all know that moving on means from moving from a Tatooine cave to a Tatooine

1300
01:03:57,540 --> 01:03:58,540
hut.

1301
01:03:58,540 --> 01:04:02,340
Moreover, at this point he should be the most wanted fucking Jedi in the galaxy now that

1302
01:04:02,340 --> 01:04:06,300
it's confirmed he's still alive, having been a Jedi Master, a General of the Old Republic,

1303
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:09,420
his knowledge and dealings with the Rebel Alliance, his knowledge of Darth Vader's

1304
01:04:09,420 --> 01:04:13,340
true identity, the fact that he managed to humiliate Vader in single combat again.

1305
01:04:13,340 --> 01:04:16,360
His cover is entirely blown, but hey, it's okay.

1306
01:04:16,360 --> 01:04:20,460
As part of the reset button, Vader tells the Emperor he's not going to pursue Obi-Wan,

1307
01:04:20,460 --> 01:04:23,440
even though that goes against literally everything established about him.

1308
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:26,660
This is Ian McDiamond, whatever his name is, his one scene in the show.

1309
01:04:26,660 --> 01:04:32,620
I bet he literally phoned his lines in over at Discord.

1310
01:04:32,620 --> 01:04:33,620
No!

1311
01:04:33,620 --> 01:04:37,340
These events have proven that Luke desperately needs you around, Obi-Wan.

1312
01:04:37,340 --> 01:04:42,180
There are Imperial files somewhere that link you to Bail Organa and his daughter, and then

1313
01:04:42,180 --> 01:04:46,820
you dropped a top secret message linking Bail Organa to the young boy in Uncle Owen's

1314
01:04:46,820 --> 01:04:47,820
care.

1315
01:04:47,820 --> 01:04:51,160
Now, the audience knows that Riva got a hold of the message and nobody else, but you don't

1316
01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:52,220
know that, Obi-Wan.

1317
01:04:52,220 --> 01:04:56,260
From your point of view, there's a trail of breadcrumbs out there leading Vader to

1318
01:04:56,260 --> 01:04:58,480
Luke, just waiting for somebody to stumble upon it.

1319
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:02,880
And Obi-Wan is too fucking stupid to even recognize that it's the case.

1320
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:05,180
But that's okay, because you know who's equally stupid?

1321
01:05:05,180 --> 01:05:06,340
Darth Vader himself.

1322
01:05:13,180 --> 01:05:18,140
So, Darth Vader is a retard, and it's not solely because of the Obi-Wan Kenobi show,

1323
01:05:18,140 --> 01:05:22,460
but that does give us the final puzzle pieces that allow us to definitively declare him

1324
01:05:22,460 --> 01:05:23,460
retarded.

1325
01:05:23,460 --> 01:05:27,380
Like I said earlier, Leia's association with Obi-Wan should mean that a Star Destroyer

1326
01:05:27,380 --> 01:05:30,580
should immediately land on the Organa family house.

1327
01:05:30,580 --> 01:05:34,300
Riva told the Grand Inquisitor that there was a connection between Obi-Wan and Bail

1328
01:05:34,300 --> 01:05:35,300
in the archives.

1329
01:05:35,300 --> 01:05:37,900
The Grand Inquisitor has witnessed the result of that connection.

1330
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:39,100
Obi-Wan came out of hiding.

1331
01:05:39,100 --> 01:05:42,860
Yeah, Vader told the Emperor he wasn't going to obsess over Obi-Wan, which is this show's

1332
01:05:42,860 --> 01:05:45,020
hackneyed way of tying up the loose end.

1333
01:05:45,020 --> 01:05:49,040
But even with catching Obi-Wan off the table, surely the Grand Inquisitor is smart enough

1334
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:54,700
to think, hmm, maybe I should go down to the Imperial archives myself and retrace Riva's

1335
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:55,700
steps.

1336
01:05:55,700 --> 01:05:59,620
Not to find Kenobi himself, but maybe to find Bail's connection to him and the Rebels.

1337
01:05:59,620 --> 01:06:03,540
Even without Bail's incriminating message, Riva left the rest of the Imperial characters

1338
01:06:03,540 --> 01:06:04,880
enough clues to begin a hunt.

1339
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:09,040
We know that Darth Vader doesn't learn that Luke is his son until the middle of Empire

1340
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:10,040
Strikes Back.

1341
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:34,220
George Lucas added this scene in one of the 50 remastered editions.

1342
01:06:34,340 --> 01:06:46,020
The original also informs him of the news, in a more roundabout way.

1343
01:06:46,020 --> 01:06:50,780
Bail Organa, Yoda, and Obi-Wan plotted at the end of Episode III to hide the children

1344
01:06:50,780 --> 01:06:51,780
away.

1345
01:07:04,220 --> 01:07:16,220
Yeah, we've already talked about how the Sith won't sense the Maximination is kind

1346
01:07:16,220 --> 01:07:19,260
of shit, considering the job that Leia is being groomed into.

1347
01:07:19,260 --> 01:07:21,540
God, I hate that that word's been ruined.

1348
01:07:21,540 --> 01:07:24,300
This is actually how you're supposed to use it, that you groom a person for leadership

1349
01:07:24,300 --> 01:07:25,300
at a young age.

1350
01:07:25,300 --> 01:07:27,460
Get your minds out of the gutter, you weirdos.

1351
01:07:27,460 --> 01:07:29,460
Vader knows he has family on Tatooine.

1352
01:07:29,460 --> 01:07:33,820
He and Padme visited them in Episode II, where Owen and Beru have Ani's old protocol droids,

1353
01:07:33,820 --> 01:07:35,460
C-3PO, which they take with them.

1354
01:07:35,460 --> 01:07:40,180
And then Uncle Owen buys back the same protocol droid 20 years later, without recognizing

1355
01:07:40,180 --> 01:07:41,180
him.

1356
01:07:41,180 --> 01:07:42,180
Geez.

1357
01:07:42,180 --> 01:07:43,180
Maybe Owen always was an idiot.

1358
01:07:43,180 --> 01:07:47,020
Yeah, stolen from me.

1359
01:07:47,020 --> 01:07:50,060
But they drop off Luke with these people, whom Vader already knows about.

1360
01:07:50,060 --> 01:07:52,640
And they don't even bother to change his fucking name?

1361
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:54,820
Why does he call himself Luke Skywalker?

1362
01:07:54,820 --> 01:07:57,740
Why wouldn't it be Luke Lars to keep up the charade?

1363
01:07:57,740 --> 01:08:02,580
You know that it's supposed to be public record, that Padme lost her twins when she died, right?

1364
01:08:02,580 --> 01:08:05,200
That's why she's made to look pregnant during her funeral?

1365
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:06,700
Because they were faking this shit?

1366
01:08:06,700 --> 01:08:08,660
Why did they keep that last name for Luke?

1367
01:08:08,660 --> 01:08:09,660
Okay, fine.

1368
01:08:09,660 --> 01:08:10,660
He's Luke Skywalker.

1369
01:08:10,660 --> 01:08:14,960
Somehow, word didn't get back to the Empire that, on the moisture farm where Vader knows

1370
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:19,700
he has family, there's a young boy who looks and acts like him named Luke Skywalker.

1371
01:08:19,700 --> 01:08:20,700
Alright.

1372
01:08:20,700 --> 01:08:23,900
When the hunt for the Death Star plans in A New Hope brings Vader back to Tatooine,

1373
01:08:23,900 --> 01:08:26,380
do you think he's ever looking out the window and thinking like,

1374
01:08:26,380 --> 01:08:29,440
Hmm, I wonder how Owen and Beru are doing down there?

1375
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:31,620
And then the search goes forward like we see in the movie.

1376
01:08:31,620 --> 01:08:33,460
Later Stormtroopers find the escape pod.

1377
01:08:33,460 --> 01:08:35,220
They find evidence that there's droids.

1378
01:08:35,220 --> 01:08:37,460
They follow the droid tracks to Jawa tracks.

1379
01:08:37,460 --> 01:08:40,500
They catch up with the Jawas, torture them for information on who bought the droids,

1380
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:43,240
and then kill them, making it look like it was a Sand People attack.

1381
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:47,220
The information leads them to the Lars farm, where they fucking disintegrate Uncle Owen

1382
01:08:47,220 --> 01:08:48,220
and Aunt Beru.

1383
01:08:48,220 --> 01:08:51,700
How in the hell do you think that conversation went back on the Star Destroyer?

1384
01:08:51,700 --> 01:08:53,420
So how did it go down there?

1385
01:08:53,420 --> 01:08:56,980
Well the droids were sold to a moisture farmer named Owen Lars, but the trail ran cold.

1386
01:08:56,980 --> 01:08:59,020
Oh, that's a funny coincidence.

1387
01:08:59,020 --> 01:09:04,580
Yeah don't worry though, we killed him to keep it a secret.

1388
01:09:04,580 --> 01:09:06,380
The Stormtroopers are looking for droids, right?

1389
01:09:06,380 --> 01:09:11,340
So maybe after torching the Lars family, the smart thing to do is to ransack the farm looking

1390
01:09:11,340 --> 01:09:14,140
for the droids or maybe any other information that might help.

1391
01:09:14,140 --> 01:09:17,380
Maybe the Stormtroopers find evidence that there's actually a third member of the family,

1392
01:09:17,380 --> 01:09:21,620
like say a teenage boy, another bedroom, a third bed, a smaller set of clothes, maybe

1393
01:09:21,620 --> 01:09:24,260
a toy or two that it turns out Obi-Wan gave him.

1394
01:09:24,260 --> 01:09:28,140
Maybe they find paperwork or evidence that this boy's name is Luke fucking Skywalker.

1395
01:09:28,140 --> 01:09:32,260
Maybe before Owen and Beru die they say that the droids aren't here right now, that their

1396
01:09:32,260 --> 01:09:37,380
son Luke fucking Skywalker is taking them to get maintenance in Anchorhead or something.

1397
01:09:37,380 --> 01:09:40,580
Surely this news gets back to Vader eventually in a mission report or something.

1398
01:09:40,580 --> 01:09:45,020
You'd think he'd be interested in this mysterious new young relative of his who has gone missing

1399
01:09:45,020 --> 01:09:46,540
with the plans of the Death Star.

1400
01:09:46,540 --> 01:09:49,180
You'd think that when the Rebels attack the Death Star at the end of the movie and the

1401
01:09:49,180 --> 01:09:53,700
Imperials figure out that they use the plans to find a weakness, and then Vader notices

1402
01:09:53,700 --> 01:09:57,660
the pilot who eventually hits the bullseye.

1403
01:09:57,700 --> 01:10:00,220
You think he might put two and two together?

1404
01:10:00,220 --> 01:10:01,860
TIE fighters can't go faster than light.

1405
01:10:01,860 --> 01:10:02,860
They're support craft.

1406
01:10:02,860 --> 01:10:05,780
Vader's got several decades to mull it over on his way home.

1407
01:10:05,780 --> 01:10:07,380
Okay, put it together buddy.

1408
01:10:07,380 --> 01:10:10,060
Who do you think that this young hotshot Rebel pilot could be?

1409
01:10:10,060 --> 01:10:13,720
It doesn't matter though, because if the Rebellion was smart, they'd double back and pick his

1410
01:10:13,720 --> 01:10:14,900
lonesome ass off.

1411
01:10:14,900 --> 01:10:20,900
You should have killed me when you had the chance, sister.

1412
01:10:20,900 --> 01:10:27,100
Oh, so you have a twin sister.

1413
01:10:27,100 --> 01:10:30,940
Your feelings have now betrayed her too.

1414
01:10:30,940 --> 01:10:34,300
Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from me.

1415
01:10:34,300 --> 01:10:36,500
And surely you should have put this one together too?

1416
01:10:36,500 --> 01:10:39,100
Vader, who was it that Riva illegally kidnapped?

1417
01:10:39,100 --> 01:10:41,140
Did the Grand Inquisitor just not tell you?

1418
01:10:41,140 --> 01:10:45,100
Did no one look at the records of the holding cell, the interrogation room, whatever?

1419
01:10:45,100 --> 01:10:49,460
There may be motivation to keep Obi-Wan's involvement a secret, but not to keep Leia's

1420
01:10:49,460 --> 01:10:50,460
kidnapping.

1421
01:10:51,020 --> 01:10:53,900
If the Lord would have gotten back to Vader eventually, Anakin really is retarded that

1422
01:10:53,900 --> 01:10:55,260
he didn't figure all this stuff out.

1423
01:10:55,260 --> 01:10:58,020
You know, I'm starting to think that Star Wars was always stupid.

1424
01:10:58,020 --> 01:11:01,000
And I guess in that sense, the Obi-Wan Kenobi show fits right in.

1425
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,740
This is the quintessential cool scene-itis show.

1426
01:11:03,740 --> 01:11:06,860
It's so formulaic, it feels like it was written by an algorithm.

1427
01:11:06,860 --> 01:11:08,020
And here's what I mean by that.

1428
01:11:08,020 --> 01:11:11,940
George Lucas set it up at the end of Revenge of the Sith, such that all the pieces are

1429
01:11:11,940 --> 01:11:13,620
in place for Episode IV to begin.

1430
01:11:13,620 --> 01:11:14,740
Yoda's on Dagobah.

1431
01:11:14,740 --> 01:11:15,940
Bail adopts Leia.

1432
01:11:15,940 --> 01:11:17,260
Uncle Owen adopts Luke.

1433
01:11:17,260 --> 01:11:19,940
C-3PO's memory is wiped to protect Leia's identity.

1434
01:11:19,940 --> 01:11:23,900
But R2-D2's isn't, making him a colossal asshole who could have told anybody everything

1435
01:11:23,900 --> 01:11:25,560
at any time and he just didn't.

1436
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:30,460
So an Obi-Wan Kenobi show taking place in Episodes III and IV has to do a few things.

1437
01:11:30,460 --> 01:11:33,020
Firstly, it can't majorly disrupt the lore.

1438
01:11:33,020 --> 01:11:36,100
Whatever happens during the show, we have to end up back where we started, with the

1439
01:11:36,100 --> 01:11:38,120
pieces still in place for Episode IV.

1440
01:11:38,120 --> 01:11:39,960
Which means you have two options.

1441
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:43,600
Option A, it's a tiny character piece exploring Obi-Wan and his solitude.

1442
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:48,320
Option B, anything done that could mess up the lore, if left unresolved, has to be resolved

1443
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:50,600
such that the integrity of the story is maintained.

1444
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:54,440
Secondly, it can't betray the characterization of the people that the audience cares about.

1445
01:11:54,440 --> 01:11:57,900
There's a natural midpoint between who these people are in Episode III and who they become

1446
01:11:57,900 --> 01:12:01,160
in Episode IV, and that can be a very precise target to hit.

1447
01:12:01,160 --> 01:12:04,360
In other words, it has to respect the story and it has to respect the characters.

1448
01:12:04,360 --> 01:12:07,080
Does Obi-Wan Kenobi do either of these things?

1449
01:12:07,080 --> 01:12:08,320
Let's start with the characters.

1450
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:09,840
Obi-Wan is pretty much spot on.

1451
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:12,080
Uncle Owen's conflict with him is only natural.

1452
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:14,960
Leia seems about correct even though her actress isn't great.

1453
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:15,960
Vader?

1454
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:17,000
I don't know about this one.

1455
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:20,840
People tend to forget how tame Vader was in A New Hope, he was always a Saturday morning

1456
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:21,840
cartoon villain.

1457
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:22,840
We meet again at last.

1458
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:23,840
The circle is now complete.

1459
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:31,040
When I left you I was but the learner, now I am the master.

1460
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:35,940
I think that's why, when fans recreated the Vader-Obi-Wan fight from Episode IV, to make

1461
01:12:35,940 --> 01:12:40,640
it more line up with their physical abilities from Episode III, they also made Vader a lot

1462
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:41,640
angrier.

1463
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:43,280
Okay, how about the plot then?

1464
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:47,500
Well, you just listened to my over an hour long epic rant on how this one's an obvious

1465
01:12:47,500 --> 01:12:48,500
NO.

1466
01:12:48,500 --> 01:12:51,400
I don't think I've ever written anything this detailed for my channel in my entire

1467
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:52,400
life.

1468
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:54,680
This show has almost an infinite number of problems.

1469
01:12:54,680 --> 01:12:57,600
Firstly, it can't choose what kind of story it wants to be.

1470
01:12:57,600 --> 01:13:01,020
A tiny character piece or an epic adventure with a big reset button.

1471
01:13:01,020 --> 01:13:02,360
So it tries to do both.

1472
01:13:02,360 --> 01:13:05,880
One A and one B. The first episode, showing Obi-Wan's depression and the state of his

1473
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:06,880
life.

1474
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:07,880
That shit is great.

1475
01:13:07,880 --> 01:13:10,160
I know some fanboys were complaining that they made Obi-Wan a cuck, but I don't care.

1476
01:13:10,160 --> 01:13:11,160
It was good.

1477
01:13:11,160 --> 01:13:13,760
That's exactly what you should do if you're making this kind of show.

1478
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:18,080
Obi-Wan's lost, he's defeated, and billions of people are now suffering because he failed.

1479
01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:22,080
He should be a scarred character, and the triumphant hero story of how he gets his mojo

1480
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:24,440
back, that is exactly what this narrative needs.

1481
01:13:24,440 --> 01:13:26,440
This series also answers another question.

1482
01:13:26,440 --> 01:13:29,040
Why Obi-Wan doesn't think that Vader can be redeemed.

1483
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:31,360
There is still good in him.

1484
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:34,120
He's more machine now than man.

1485
01:13:34,120 --> 01:13:36,360
Twisted and evil.

1486
01:13:36,360 --> 01:13:39,680
I mean, you can kind of imply it from the prequels, but at least here it's spelled

1487
01:13:39,680 --> 01:13:40,680
out explicitly.

1488
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:44,560
Also, they kind of shoehorn in him, calling Anakin, Darth.

1489
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:48,880
Goodbye, Darth.

1490
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:50,840
Which I don't know, it doesn't really work, but fine.

1491
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:55,560
But all the character stuff from one A suffers from all the rebellion stuff from one B, and

1492
01:13:55,560 --> 01:13:57,800
that's all just pure garbage.

1493
01:13:57,800 --> 01:13:59,280
None of those characters are likable.

1494
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:02,840
None of them matter in the long run, except Leia, and she necessarily has plot armor the

1495
01:14:02,840 --> 01:14:03,840
whole show.

1496
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:05,360
How many plot holes are there in this story?

1497
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:06,740
How many unnecessary arcs?

1498
01:14:06,740 --> 01:14:08,040
How many unnecessary scenes?

1499
01:14:08,040 --> 01:14:10,400
How many lines of dialogue that just make no sense?

1500
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:12,440
I'm sorry, but that's not my problem.

1501
01:14:12,440 --> 01:14:15,360
Look, if you want my help, you got it.

1502
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:19,640
Soon the location of the network and Kenobi will be ours.

1503
01:14:19,640 --> 01:14:21,360
Kenobi is all that matters.

1504
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:22,800
You're in, die, you know.

1505
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:24,520
All signals in or out are blocked.

1506
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:26,400
I let your parents know you're safe.

1507
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:31,240
I know he said no communication, but your silence worries me.

1508
01:14:31,240 --> 01:14:35,040
I am what you made me.

1509
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:38,440
I am not your failure, Obi-Wan.

1510
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:43,480
No matter whether he dies or I do, this ends today.

1511
01:14:43,480 --> 01:14:48,280
Goodbye, Darth.

1512
01:14:48,280 --> 01:14:55,520
But there's always a teacher, someone who mentors the young hero in what his destiny

1513
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:56,520
is.

1514
01:14:56,520 --> 01:15:02,320
And in this case, it's an old Jedi who has been sitting out in the desert primarily waiting

1515
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:04,320
for this moment to happen.

1516
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:14,320
He served me well during the Clone Wars and has lived in hiding since the Emperor's Purge.

1517
01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:16,200
Yes, I will send for him.

1518
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:17,200
One last fight.

1519
01:15:17,200 --> 01:15:20,840
He's been sitting out in the desert primarily waiting for this moment to happen.

1520
01:15:20,840 --> 01:15:23,940
He's lived in hiding since the Emperor's Purge.

1521
01:15:23,940 --> 01:15:25,920
One last fight.

1522
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:30,000
Also, if you're telling a story and you want the audience to care, the rules have to be

1523
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,840
at least somewhat consistent.

1524
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:36,080
If Darth Vader can extinguish flames at the Force or pull a starship down from takeoff,

1525
01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:39,000
you can't just have him not be able to do it a second later.

1526
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,820
There has to be a consistent idea of what the stakes are.

1527
01:15:41,820 --> 01:15:45,940
If people keep surviving gut-stabbings, no matter how many fucking stomachs they have,

1528
01:15:45,940 --> 01:15:50,120
the audience's reaction to a scene like this isn't, oh my god, he's dead, it's, I wonder

1529
01:15:50,120 --> 01:15:51,280
if they'll bring him back or not.

1530
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:55,140
If anything, the moral lesson of Star Wars is at this point, when you kill somebody,

1531
01:15:55,140 --> 01:15:57,160
make sure to actually fucking finish the job.

1532
01:15:57,160 --> 01:16:01,560
The Grand Inquisitor comes back, Darth Maul's come back now, Riva came back twice.

1533
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:07,240
There's also just a bunch of small things that bug me about Kenobi too.

1534
01:16:07,240 --> 01:16:09,960
Yeah, the quality is all over the place like I mentioned at the start of the video.

1535
01:16:09,960 --> 01:16:12,080
But also, Vader looks weird in this show.

1536
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:16,360
I know it's not just Hayden Christensen's scrawny ass in that suit, but still, something's

1537
01:16:16,360 --> 01:16:17,360
off.

1538
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:20,320
They keep showing him in these wide shots far away from everyone else, so no one's making

1539
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:21,820
any comparisons about his size.

1540
01:16:21,820 --> 01:16:23,440
Look at the Riva Force choke scene.

1541
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:27,120
Riva is clearly his height, except when he gets closer and then it's like, whoops, he's

1542
01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:28,800
suddenly two feet taller than her.

1543
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:30,840
It's not just the visuals though, it's the writing too.

1544
01:16:30,840 --> 01:16:34,440
Riva's got like three scenes setting up her storyline in the first episode.

1545
01:16:34,440 --> 01:16:36,200
Leia goes running through the woods twice.

1546
01:16:36,200 --> 01:16:38,400
We've got three days at Obi-Wan's dreary job.

1547
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:41,400
And it's not just establishing scenes that repeat.

1548
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:44,220
How many times did Obi-Wan have private conversations in public?

1549
01:16:44,220 --> 01:16:46,360
Or how many times did he try to sacrifice himself?

1550
01:16:46,360 --> 01:16:49,560
Hell, the entirety of Episode 4 is just filler.

1551
01:16:49,560 --> 01:16:50,560
Think about it.

1552
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:55,240
The total arc of the show is, Leia's kidnapped, Obi-Wan goes to help, he rescues Leia on Daewoo,

1553
01:16:55,240 --> 01:16:59,000
he has to get smuggled by the Rebels off-world to some mining planet, I still don't know

1554
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:02,000
the name, I still don't care to look it up, where the Empire catches up and Obi-Wan has

1555
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:03,960
to confront Vader, the Ghost from his past.

1556
01:17:03,960 --> 01:17:06,720
Obi-Wan loses that fight, this is the low point of the story.

1557
01:17:06,720 --> 01:17:11,380
Leia's kidnapped a second time, Obi-Wan rescues her again, they go to the Rebel base on Jabiim,

1558
01:17:11,380 --> 01:17:15,580
the Empire lays siege to it, the Rebels escape just in time, Obi-Wan has his second showdown

1559
01:17:15,580 --> 01:17:16,580
and wins.

1560
01:17:16,580 --> 01:17:21,100
You can cut out the Leia re-kidnap and re-rescue bit from Episode 4 entirely and the story

1561
01:17:21,100 --> 01:17:22,360
is completely fine.

1562
01:17:22,360 --> 01:17:26,400
In fact, it's better because the lore-breaking scene where Leia reveals to agents of the

1563
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:29,600
Empire that she knows Obi-Wan is cut out along with that arc.

1564
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:34,160
In prep for this video, I think I've watched this show about 4 times now, God rest my soul,

1565
01:17:34,160 --> 01:17:39,040
and I've really begun to notice just how many times micro-arcs repeat only to pad out the

1566
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:40,880
runtime of what should have been a movie.

1567
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:44,840
We know that this story was originally supposed to be a movie, Kenobi the Balance of the Force.

1568
01:17:44,840 --> 01:17:48,920
Disney sees the writing on the wall when it comes to TV shows and miniseries versus movies,

1569
01:17:48,920 --> 01:17:53,040
especially after the success of The Mandalorian versus the failure of Solo A Star Wars Story.

1570
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:56,840
So they took their script for Kenobi A Star Wars Story and stretched it out to Kenobi

1571
01:17:56,840 --> 01:17:58,040
A 6 Episode Story.

1572
01:17:58,040 --> 01:18:01,600
In fact, several people have already re-cut it into a movie and as a movie it actually

1573
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:02,600
works pretty well.

1574
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:05,880
I mean it's not perfect, but if you only use the footage and the plot on hand, you

1575
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:08,360
can actually make an okay feature film out of this.

1576
01:18:08,360 --> 01:18:11,360
It still doesn't hold a candle to the Kenobi fan film though, which basically does the

1577
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:14,940
quiet Tatooine character story and does it 10,000 times better.

1578
01:18:14,940 --> 01:18:16,200
It's all the same beats.

1579
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:19,720
Obi-Wan is old and downtrodden, he's losing his connection to the Force, Uncle Owen wants

1580
01:18:19,720 --> 01:18:22,540
him to go away, and by the end Obi-Wan gets his mojo back.

1581
01:18:22,540 --> 01:18:24,140
But it's actually legitimately good.

1582
01:18:24,140 --> 01:18:27,580
The fans really do understand Star Wars in a way that Disney doesn't.

1583
01:18:27,580 --> 01:18:31,780
At this point, it's obvious to me just how much of Kenobi is a repeat of something we've

1584
01:18:31,780 --> 01:18:32,780
seen before.

1585
01:18:32,780 --> 01:18:37,060
Yeah, they repeat scenes, or they repeat whole arcs even just to fill the hour, but it's

1586
01:18:37,060 --> 01:18:38,420
not only that.

1587
01:18:38,420 --> 01:18:42,180
Pretty much everything noteworthy from this show is taken from something else.

1588
01:18:42,180 --> 01:18:45,100
This part's from the fan film, this part's from Return of the Jedi, this part's from

1589
01:18:45,100 --> 01:18:47,220
the video game, this part's from Rogue One.

1590
01:18:47,220 --> 01:18:54,700
And the linchpin moment of the show has already been done before, in Rebels with Ahsoka Tano.

1591
01:18:54,700 --> 01:18:58,580
I know, I know, it's just a TV show, stop caring Dev, why can't you just shut your

1592
01:18:58,580 --> 01:19:02,220
brain off and let the images enter through your eyes and have a mildly entertaining evening?

1593
01:19:02,220 --> 01:19:05,940
I understand that point of view, and there is some value in just liking something for

1594
01:19:05,940 --> 01:19:07,740
the spectacle, even if it is dumb.

1595
01:19:07,740 --> 01:19:13,160
But that has to be a choice that you as the viewer make, not they as the creator insist

1596
01:19:13,160 --> 01:19:14,160
that you choose.

1597
01:19:14,160 --> 01:19:17,060
Okay, here's a good example, this happened back in 2015.

1598
01:19:17,060 --> 01:19:18,740
Back when the video game Fallout 4 came out.

1599
01:19:18,740 --> 01:19:21,500
If you don't know anything about Fallout, here's the quick TLDR.

1600
01:19:21,500 --> 01:19:25,440
Nuclear war happens, Americans take shelter in vaults built by the Vault-Tec Corporation.

1601
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:29,140
Some of the vaults turn out to be weird social experiments set up to study human behavior.

1602
01:19:29,140 --> 01:19:33,060
Vault 95 was housed with only drug addicts, and there were no drugs in the vault.

1603
01:19:33,060 --> 01:19:37,240
Except, five years in, a massive stash of drugs would be revealed in a hidden location

1604
01:19:37,240 --> 01:19:38,240
in the vault.

1605
01:19:38,240 --> 01:19:41,480
The problem is, one of the logs the player can find is written by a delivery man, where

1606
01:19:41,480 --> 01:19:43,620
he says that he's delivering a shipment of Jet.

1607
01:19:43,620 --> 01:19:47,260
Jet is a fictional drug in Fallout, it's a weird cross between meth and jankum made

1608
01:19:47,260 --> 01:19:49,980
from the fumes of dung from irradiated cattle.

1609
01:19:49,980 --> 01:19:53,700
Jet was invented after the bombs dropped, so there was no way that a pre-war delivery

1610
01:19:53,700 --> 01:19:56,100
man was bringing a shipment to Vault 95.

1611
01:19:56,100 --> 01:19:59,020
Now this is a problem that's very easy to fix, especially in a video game.

1612
01:19:59,020 --> 01:20:02,660
You just say, oh sorry guys, my mistake, and then in the next patch just change the text

1613
01:20:02,660 --> 01:20:03,660
of the log.

1614
01:20:03,660 --> 01:20:04,660
One and done, right?

1615
01:20:04,660 --> 01:20:05,660
But that's not what happened.

1616
01:20:05,660 --> 01:20:10,020
The writer of that quest, Pete Hines, when the inconsistency went viral on Twitter, replied

1617
01:20:10,020 --> 01:20:14,160
with saying, doesn't say what year that was posted, implying that after the bombs

1618
01:20:14,160 --> 01:20:18,820
had dropped and Jet had been invented, Vault-Tec was somehow still around and still sending

1619
01:20:18,820 --> 01:20:21,140
out trucks of drugs to Vault 95.

1620
01:20:21,140 --> 01:20:25,380
When the fan pointed out the obvious flaw in that logic, as well as other consistency

1621
01:20:25,380 --> 01:20:30,060
problems, Pete Hines gave this response, not interested in discussing how realistic things

1622
01:20:30,060 --> 01:20:34,780
are in an alternate universe post-apocalyptic game with talking mutants and ghouls.

1623
01:20:34,780 --> 01:20:39,480
And of course, various game and tech-based news outlets backed him up, making fun of

1624
01:20:39,480 --> 01:20:45,240
fans who dared to complain about lore inconsistencies because of not taking the series seriously

1625
01:20:45,240 --> 01:20:49,960
enough that features aliens, a talking tree, invincible children, and guns that fire miniature

1626
01:20:49,960 --> 01:20:50,960
nuclear warheads.

1627
01:20:50,960 --> 01:20:54,840
And it's like, on some level, yeah, that actually makes sense.

1628
01:20:54,840 --> 01:20:56,200
It is just a story.

1629
01:20:56,200 --> 01:20:57,320
It's just a fictional world.

1630
01:20:57,320 --> 01:21:01,320
So if the new writers working on it make a mistake, on some level, you shouldn't take

1631
01:21:01,320 --> 01:21:02,460
it too seriously.

1632
01:21:02,460 --> 01:21:06,780
But the flip side of that, as part of not taking it seriously, is no longer consuming

1633
01:21:06,780 --> 01:21:07,780
it.

1634
01:21:07,780 --> 01:21:10,860
The game is created by Interplay, though the games are now made by Bethesda, which

1635
01:21:10,860 --> 01:21:13,420
is a whole other rabbit hole not worth going down for this video.

1636
01:21:13,420 --> 01:21:17,260
The point is, Bethesda is not the creator of Fallout, they're only its current owners.

1637
01:21:17,260 --> 01:21:20,660
The people who work at Bethesda might care to a point, but if push comes to shove, they

1638
01:21:20,660 --> 01:21:22,620
prioritize their own vision.

1639
01:21:22,620 --> 01:21:25,780
And stuff like this is ultimately how they view it.

1640
01:21:25,780 --> 01:21:29,440
Because while if you're a fan of Fallout, it means something to you, that's why you

1641
01:21:29,440 --> 01:21:33,200
enjoy it, that's why you're the superfan, but to them, it's only a vehicle for their

1642
01:21:33,200 --> 01:21:34,200
new story.

1643
01:21:34,200 --> 01:21:39,000
If they can get away with not respecting old lore, not simply just to save face in a Twitter

1644
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:43,440
fight, but also because the old lore gets in the way of the new story they want to tell,

1645
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:47,560
and they believe that you'll continue consuming the product, what incentive do they have to

1646
01:21:47,560 --> 01:21:48,800
respect the old lore?

1647
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:53,040
And through that lens, we can understand why Pete Hines took it as a personal attack, that

1648
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:57,840
fans pointed out there was inconsistencies between his writing and what came before.

1649
01:21:57,840 --> 01:22:01,040
Now how many times have you heard a story like this?

1650
01:22:01,040 --> 01:22:02,040
How many video games?

1651
01:22:02,040 --> 01:22:03,040
How many TV shows?

1652
01:22:03,040 --> 01:22:04,040
How many movies?

1653
01:22:04,880 --> 01:22:06,000
Something equivalent to this happened to.

1654
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,560
People take these things seriously because they love them.

1655
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:12,680
When they see inconsistencies, they're worried that the new stewards don't actually care.

1656
01:22:12,680 --> 01:22:16,300
And when those new stewards respond like this, it's a confirmation that they're really

1657
01:22:16,300 --> 01:22:20,560
only here to wear the progressive skin suit of the thing that you love, to ignore pre-established

1658
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:23,040
storylines and push whatever it is they want to push.

1659
01:22:23,040 --> 01:22:25,960
So apply this lens back to Star Wars, and what do you see?

1660
01:22:25,960 --> 01:22:30,040
When I watched that final scene with Riva crying in the sand, I had a sinking feeling

1661
01:22:30,040 --> 01:22:32,520
that this whole thing existed simply to set up her spin-off show.

1662
01:22:32,680 --> 01:22:36,360
They were taking a beloved character, this guy in the title, and using him as the opening

1663
01:22:36,360 --> 01:22:38,840
act for the story they actually wanted to tell.

1664
01:22:38,840 --> 01:22:41,640
This is like bait-and-switch Member Berries, where you think you're getting the Member

1665
01:22:41,640 --> 01:22:43,320
Berries you want and that's how they drag you in.

1666
01:22:43,320 --> 01:22:44,320
But it was me, Riva!

1667
01:22:44,320 --> 01:22:48,280
Jesus, we're this far into the video and I completely forgot to talk about the Qui-Gon

1668
01:22:48,280 --> 01:22:49,280
scene.

1669
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:50,960
I actually forgot about it, it's that forgettable.

1670
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:52,920
I'm re-recording this days later.

1671
01:22:52,920 --> 01:22:56,980
One of the big Member Berries scenes of Kenobi is in the very end, where Qui-Gon shows up

1672
01:22:56,980 --> 01:23:01,360
as a Force ghost and basically says, get ready for season two, you fucking nerds.

1673
01:23:01,400 --> 01:23:06,440
This scene serves no purpose whatsoever, other than to get fanboys to record reaction videos,

1674
01:23:06,440 --> 01:23:09,000
like how they reacted to Luke at the end of Mando season two.

1675
01:23:31,360 --> 01:23:47,520
A far better use of Qui-Gon would have been, in the scene where Obi-Wan is buried by rocks

1676
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:51,120
during the Vader fight, Qui-Gon whispers to him, it wasn't your fault.

1677
01:23:51,120 --> 01:23:52,220
And that would have made sense.

1678
01:23:52,220 --> 01:23:56,500
The whole story is, or should be, about Obi-Wan coming to grips with his guilt.

1679
01:23:56,500 --> 01:24:00,360
In A Phantom Menace, Obi-Wan didn't want to train Anakin, Qui-Gon did.

1680
01:24:00,360 --> 01:24:02,940
And Qui-Gon made Obi-Wan promise him to do it.

1681
01:24:02,940 --> 01:24:07,260
The rock Berries scene would have been far superior with Qui-Gon in it, than with Obi-Wan

1682
01:24:07,260 --> 01:24:11,640
fantasizing about kids, but it wouldn't have given us that reactable moment that Disney

1683
01:24:11,640 --> 01:24:12,640
wanted.

1684
01:24:12,640 --> 01:24:16,580
Yet again, they sacrificed the soul of the story for what looked cool.

1685
01:24:16,580 --> 01:24:21,640
The reason people originally liked Star Wars is because, despite the many flaws of these

1686
01:24:21,640 --> 01:24:24,160
movies, it had something to say about the human condition.

1687
01:24:24,160 --> 01:24:27,980
It's not really about stormtroopers and death stars and X-wings and lightsabers.

1688
01:24:27,980 --> 01:24:28,980
Those are the trappings.

1689
01:24:28,980 --> 01:24:29,980
That's the window dressing.

1690
01:24:30,020 --> 01:24:32,940
That's what you drape over top of what should be, a good solid story.

1691
01:24:32,940 --> 01:24:36,020
George Lucas has correctly identified that A New Hope is more of a fantasy film than

1692
01:24:36,020 --> 01:24:37,020
a sci-fi one.

1693
01:24:37,020 --> 01:24:43,740
My original inspiration on this film was really to use mythological motifs to create a whole

1694
01:24:43,740 --> 01:24:48,540
new kind of myth that was very updated and contemporary.

1695
01:24:48,540 --> 01:24:54,800
So I used the Saturday matinee serial as my vessel to put this barrel of mythological

1696
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:56,300
motifs together.

1697
01:24:56,340 --> 01:25:00,580
Since it's based on a very kind of old story and not a high-tech story, it's more of a

1698
01:25:00,580 --> 01:25:05,020
fantasy film than a science fiction film, I was able to use archetypes which helped

1699
01:25:05,020 --> 01:25:10,120
develop the characters and put them in a context where they could be easily grasped because

1700
01:25:10,120 --> 01:25:11,940
they are traditional characters.

1701
01:25:11,940 --> 01:25:18,260
And this is the same story that has been told a thousand times around the world for several

1702
01:25:18,260 --> 01:25:19,620
thousand years.

1703
01:25:19,620 --> 01:25:20,740
This is a mythic story.

1704
01:25:20,740 --> 01:25:24,180
It models for us what it means to be a hero in a very generic sense.

1705
01:25:24,380 --> 01:25:28,380
Luke Skywalker is a child of destiny given a magic sword by an old wizard and told to

1706
01:25:28,380 --> 01:25:31,700
storm a fortress guarded by the Black Knight in order to rescue a princess.

1707
01:25:31,700 --> 01:25:36,020
The scope and scale of the story, along with 4 1977 state-of-the-art effects, help cover

1708
01:25:36,020 --> 01:25:39,100
up the fact that Star Wars is a very basic hero's journey.

1709
01:25:39,100 --> 01:25:41,780
Meanwhile, The Empire Strikes Back turns us on its head.

1710
01:25:41,780 --> 01:25:45,160
It's a story about how the hero deals with his own failure, how it's his own heroism

1711
01:25:45,160 --> 01:25:48,980
that is the source of the failure, and how to come to grips with the terrible truth.

1712
01:25:48,980 --> 01:25:51,460
Luke's heroic traits are well-defined in A New Hope.

1713
01:25:51,460 --> 01:25:53,640
He's courageous, loyal, and impulsive.

1714
01:25:53,640 --> 01:25:57,800
All qualities well-suited for a young man leaping to the defense of the helpless.

1715
01:25:57,800 --> 01:26:01,880
But in Empire, these qualities lead him to a confrontation with Vader that he isn't

1716
01:26:01,880 --> 01:26:04,320
ready for and he loses badly.

1717
01:26:04,320 --> 01:26:07,280
Yoda tells him point blank before it even happens.

1718
01:26:07,280 --> 01:26:13,920
If you end your training now, if you choose the quick and easy path as Vader did, you

1719
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:15,780
will become an agent of evil.

1720
01:26:15,780 --> 01:26:19,520
But Luke has to experience it to truly understand the path that he's on.

1721
01:26:19,520 --> 01:26:21,960
Return of the Jedi is the culmination of this story.

1722
01:26:21,960 --> 01:26:25,480
Luke's first appearance in the movie, he's acting a little bit more Sith-like than the

1723
01:26:25,480 --> 01:26:29,040
audience should be comfortable with, but at the same time, he's also more patient.

1724
01:26:29,040 --> 01:26:33,740
He allows Jabba to make aggressive moves and mistakes while his own plan unfolds.

1725
01:26:33,740 --> 01:26:36,380
This is what integrating your dark side looks like.

1726
01:26:36,380 --> 01:26:39,040
By the end of the movie, Luke refuses to kill Vader.

1727
01:26:39,040 --> 01:26:43,320
In fact, at the end of all three movies, Luke gives up control and takes a leap of faith.

1728
01:26:43,320 --> 01:26:46,960
It's not a foregone conclusion that Vader will rescue him from the Emperor's forced

1729
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:47,960
lightning.

1730
01:26:47,960 --> 01:26:51,320
Luke is doing this knowing full well he might die, but the statement is clear.

1731
01:26:51,320 --> 01:26:54,600
Luke is not going to become his father, even if it kills him.

1732
01:26:54,600 --> 01:26:57,800
Yeah, sometimes George Lucas is caught huffing his farts a bit too much.

1733
01:26:57,800 --> 01:27:08,920
I said to George, you can type this stuff, but you can't say it.

1734
01:27:08,920 --> 01:27:12,920
Move your mouth while you're talking, while you're typing it.

1735
01:27:12,920 --> 01:27:14,240
I couldn't say it.

1736
01:27:14,240 --> 01:27:18,280
But even then, the point I'm making is when you strip away all the Star Wars stuff here

1737
01:27:18,280 --> 01:27:22,400
there's a soul, a moral and ethical through line that cuts right down the center of Luke

1738
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:23,400
and his journey.

1739
01:27:23,400 --> 01:27:26,780
The movies are trying to tell us something about what it means to be a hero, what quality

1740
01:27:26,780 --> 01:27:31,300
of character a hero has, where that might lead them astray sometimes, and ultimately

1741
01:27:31,300 --> 01:27:34,800
what somebody might have to sacrifice in order to live a good life.

1742
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:38,040
And George Lucas is okay with outright saying, yeah, this is what the movies are all about.

1743
01:27:38,040 --> 01:27:43,320
Are you saying I am trying to recreate the myths of old or are you saying I just want

1744
01:27:43,320 --> 01:27:46,240
to make a good action movie?

1745
01:27:46,240 --> 01:27:54,520
Well when I did Star Wars, I consciously set about to recreate myths and the classic mythological

1746
01:27:54,520 --> 01:28:00,520
motifs, because I think the core issues that I'm dealing with are if they were valid 2,000

1747
01:28:00,520 --> 01:28:04,640
years ago, they've got to still be valid today, even though they're not in fashion.

1748
01:28:04,640 --> 01:28:05,960
Why are they out of fashion?

1749
01:28:05,960 --> 01:28:07,960
The world we live in is more complex.

1750
01:28:07,960 --> 01:28:12,680
A lot of those moralities have gotten to be grayed to the point where they don't exist

1751
01:28:12,680 --> 01:28:15,920
anymore, but those issues are still there in most people's minds.

1752
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:21,560
The importance of, say, friendship and loyalty, most people look at that and say, how corny,

1753
01:28:21,560 --> 01:28:26,240
but the issues of friendship and loyalty are very, very important, but it's not common

1754
01:28:26,240 --> 01:28:27,760
knowledge among young people.

1755
01:28:27,760 --> 01:28:28,760
They're still learning.

1756
01:28:28,760 --> 01:28:29,920
They're still picking up ideas.

1757
01:28:29,920 --> 01:28:34,440
They're still using these ideas to shape the way they're going to conduct their life, and

1758
01:28:34,440 --> 01:28:38,560
you need to tell the same story over and over again every generation, so that generation

1759
01:28:38,560 --> 01:28:39,560
gets it.

1760
01:28:39,560 --> 01:28:44,880
And I think we've gone for a few generations where a lot of the more basic stories have

1761
01:28:44,880 --> 01:28:46,280
fallen by the wayside.

1762
01:28:46,280 --> 01:28:51,520
I hear so many young people today talk about a world that's emptied of heroism, where there

1763
01:28:51,520 --> 01:28:55,200
are no more noble things to do.

1764
01:28:55,200 --> 01:28:57,280
What do you say to them?

1765
01:28:57,280 --> 01:29:00,120
Everybody becomes, everybody has the choice of being a hero or not being a hero every

1766
01:29:00,120 --> 01:29:02,280
day of their lives.

1767
01:29:02,280 --> 01:29:06,960
And you can either help somebody be compassionate toward people, or you can treat some people

1768
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:09,040
with dignity or not.

1769
01:29:09,040 --> 01:29:14,240
And one way you become a hero, and the other way, you know, you're part of the problem.

1770
01:29:14,680 --> 01:29:17,000
And it's not a grand thing.

1771
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:22,920
You know, you don't have to get into a giant laser sword fight and blow up three spaceships

1772
01:29:22,920 --> 01:29:23,920
to become a hero.

1773
01:29:23,920 --> 01:29:27,400
I mean, it's a very small thing that happens every day of your life.

1774
01:29:27,400 --> 01:29:31,640
Though people don't like the prequel trilogy nearly as much, they're still remembered fondly

1775
01:29:31,640 --> 01:29:33,160
for being the mess that they are.

1776
01:29:33,160 --> 01:29:37,680
And Lucas is also quite insistent that these films also have something to say beyond just

1777
01:29:37,680 --> 01:29:38,680
Star Wars.

1778
01:29:38,680 --> 01:29:41,560
In fact, Padme even spotlights the message in case you don't get it.

1779
01:29:41,560 --> 01:29:46,840
So this is how liberty dies, with thunderous applause.

1780
01:29:46,840 --> 01:29:50,840
One of the reasons the prequel trilogy talks so much about politics and economics is because

1781
01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:55,240
it's showing what a fearless, well-meaning, impatient young hero, somebody very much like

1782
01:29:55,240 --> 01:29:59,640
Luke, in fact, can become if he doesn't take the sacrificial path that Luke did.

1783
01:29:59,640 --> 01:30:02,280
Take that scene from episode two where Padme and Anakin talk politics.

1784
01:30:02,280 --> 01:30:04,520
Yeah, that one that became a reaction meme for a while.

1785
01:30:04,520 --> 01:30:07,040
I don't think the system works.

1786
01:30:07,040 --> 01:30:10,080
How would you have it work?

1787
01:30:10,080 --> 01:30:14,680
We need a system where the politicians sit down and discuss the problem.

1788
01:30:14,680 --> 01:30:18,280
Agree what's in the best interest of all the people, and then do it.

1789
01:30:18,280 --> 01:30:20,640
That's exactly what we do.

1790
01:30:20,640 --> 01:30:22,520
The trouble is that people don't always agree.

1791
01:30:22,520 --> 01:30:24,720
Well, then they should be made to.

1792
01:30:24,720 --> 01:30:25,720
By whom?

1793
01:30:25,720 --> 01:30:26,720
Who's gonna make them?

1794
01:30:26,720 --> 01:30:27,720
I don't know.

1795
01:30:27,720 --> 01:30:28,720
Someone.

1796
01:30:28,720 --> 01:30:29,720
You?

1797
01:30:29,720 --> 01:30:30,720
Of course not me.

1798
01:30:30,720 --> 01:30:31,720
But someone.

1799
01:30:31,720 --> 01:30:32,720
Someone wise.

1800
01:30:32,720 --> 01:30:36,880
Sounds an awful lot like a dictatorship to me.

1801
01:30:36,880 --> 01:30:39,240
Well, if it works.

1802
01:30:39,240 --> 01:30:42,080
This is actually the monarchist argument against democracy.

1803
01:30:42,080 --> 01:30:46,520
If democracy really is just a bunch of squabbling, uneducated fools, all having their worthless

1804
01:30:46,520 --> 01:30:51,160
say while a crisis grows more desperate, why shouldn't a strong individual with the expertise

1805
01:30:51,160 --> 01:30:53,400
to solve the problem be in charge instead?

1806
01:30:53,400 --> 01:30:56,360
It's the benevolent dictator, philosopher king argument.

1807
01:30:56,360 --> 01:31:00,640
Palpatine's populist rhetoric during his rise to power, if you transplant it to real life,

1808
01:31:00,640 --> 01:31:03,800
is probably pretty popular with libertarians in how he wants to dismantle components of

1809
01:31:03,800 --> 01:31:06,000
the state and end corruption and shrink bureaucracy.

1810
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:09,800
There is no civility, only politics.

1811
01:31:09,800 --> 01:31:15,520
The senate is full of greedy, squabbling delegates.

1812
01:31:15,520 --> 01:31:18,120
There is no interest in the common good.

1813
01:31:18,120 --> 01:31:22,040
If I may say so, your majesty, the chancellor has little real power.

1814
01:31:22,040 --> 01:31:26,120
He is mired by baseless accusations of corruption.

1815
01:31:26,120 --> 01:31:28,400
The bureaucrats are in charge now.

1816
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:33,920
Our best choice would be to push for the election of a stronger supreme chancellor, one who

1817
01:31:33,920 --> 01:31:37,920
could control the bureaucrats and give us justice.

1818
01:31:37,920 --> 01:31:43,000
Any other choice would be to submit a plea to the courts.

1819
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:46,040
The courts take even longer to decide things than the senate.

1820
01:31:46,040 --> 01:31:50,200
Your majesty, if I am elected, I promise to put an end to corruption.

1821
01:31:50,200 --> 01:31:52,120
I will be, chancellor.

1822
01:31:52,120 --> 01:31:55,760
I fear by the time you have control of the bureaucrats, senator, there'll be nothing

1823
01:31:55,760 --> 01:31:58,560
left of our people, our way of life.

1824
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:02,280
It is clear to me now that the republic no longer functions.

1825
01:32:02,280 --> 01:32:05,920
I pray you will bring sanity and compassion back to the senate.

1826
01:32:05,920 --> 01:32:09,920
But what his supporters don't understand, and what he keenly recognizes, is that all

1827
01:32:09,920 --> 01:32:14,660
of those multiple levels of bureaucracy are what keeps political power decentralized.

1828
01:32:14,660 --> 01:32:18,600
That decentralization has led to their current problem, where there's too many interests,

1829
01:32:18,600 --> 01:32:21,960
nobody can agree on anything, and nothing gets done even in the face of a civil war.

1830
01:32:21,960 --> 01:32:25,480
But stripping away those bureaucratic layers, however popular a move it might initially

1831
01:32:25,480 --> 01:32:28,400
be, doesn't destroy the political power vested within them.

1832
01:32:28,400 --> 01:32:31,680
It simply centralizes that power within the remaining bureaucracy.

1833
01:32:31,680 --> 01:32:35,280
The rebellion will continue to gain us support in the imperial senate.

1834
01:32:35,280 --> 01:32:39,460
The imperial senate will no longer be of any concern to us.

1835
01:32:39,460 --> 01:32:43,960
I have just received word that the emperor has dissolved the council permanently.

1836
01:32:43,960 --> 01:32:47,560
The last remnants of the old republic have been swept away.

1837
01:32:47,560 --> 01:32:48,560
That's impossible.

1838
01:32:48,560 --> 01:32:52,400
How will the emperor maintain control without the bureaucracy?

1839
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:56,760
The regional governors now have direct control over their territories.

1840
01:32:56,760 --> 01:33:00,600
It may very well be the case that if the people within a state's apparatus are corrupt, you

1841
01:33:00,600 --> 01:33:01,600
might need to clean house.

1842
01:33:02,520 --> 01:33:03,520
It's not against that.

1843
01:33:03,520 --> 01:33:05,840
But contrary to what libertarians think, shrinking the state doesn't always shrink

1844
01:33:05,840 --> 01:33:06,840
its power.

1845
01:33:06,840 --> 01:33:10,880
Sometimes, it centralizes that power into a system with a single point of failure.

1846
01:33:10,880 --> 01:33:15,200
That's why the rebellion's decisive strikes, at just the right target, are so devastating

1847
01:33:15,200 --> 01:33:16,260
throughout the series.

1848
01:33:16,260 --> 01:33:20,040
Because when you weaken a state's bureaucracy, you monopolize the state's power into one

1849
01:33:20,040 --> 01:33:23,400
autocratic leader, and at that point, all you have to do is kill him.

1850
01:33:23,400 --> 01:33:25,080
That is the lesson of the prequels.

1851
01:33:25,080 --> 01:33:27,880
The dangers of seduction, both sexual and political.

1852
01:33:27,880 --> 01:33:31,400
It's tempting to think that you know all the answers, that you can handle the forbidden

1853
01:33:31,400 --> 01:33:32,400
fruit.

1854
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:33,400
But you don't.

1855
01:33:33,400 --> 01:33:34,400
And you can't.

1856
01:33:34,400 --> 01:33:36,000
Of course, the prequels have many problems.

1857
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,040
Like a lot of what the Jedi are don't really make sense.

1858
01:33:38,040 --> 01:33:39,960
For example, why do the Jedi wear these robes?

1859
01:33:39,960 --> 01:33:42,300
Well, because that's what Obi-Wan wore in the original trilogy.

1860
01:33:42,300 --> 01:33:45,800
But if Obi-Wan's in hiding, why would he specifically run around in the uniform of

1861
01:33:45,800 --> 01:33:47,100
a persecuted class of people?

1862
01:33:47,100 --> 01:33:49,080
Why do all the Jedi act like creepy cult members?

1863
01:33:49,080 --> 01:33:53,040
Well, because Luke's journey from regular kid to Jedi Knight saw him become serious

1864
01:33:53,040 --> 01:33:54,040
and somber.

1865
01:33:54,040 --> 01:33:56,040
But that's only because of what he was going through with his father.

1866
01:33:56,040 --> 01:34:00,080
That is the limitation of George Lucas's iconic hero's journey style of storytelling,

1867
01:34:00,080 --> 01:34:02,100
when it butts up against a cultural phenomenon.

1868
01:34:02,100 --> 01:34:05,880
Whatever becomes emblematic of an idea is what sticks, even if it doesn't really make

1869
01:34:05,880 --> 01:34:06,880
any sense.

1870
01:34:06,880 --> 01:34:10,400
But it's this rough-around-the-edges nature of Lucas's Star Wars that lead internet

1871
01:34:10,400 --> 01:34:15,300
soy boys nowadays to justify the moral bankruptcy of Disney's Star Wars.

1872
01:34:15,300 --> 01:34:19,240
So if the original story is telling us how to be a sacrificial hero, and the prequel

1873
01:34:19,240 --> 01:34:23,740
story is telling us what happens if you reject the call, what does the sequel trilogy tell

1874
01:34:23,740 --> 01:34:24,740
us?

1875
01:34:24,740 --> 01:34:28,360
As far as I can tell, The Force Awakens exists to tell us that Star Wars is really cool.

1876
01:34:28,360 --> 01:34:30,000
Everything is a reference or a callback.

1877
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:34,000
They exist not as trappings of a larger story, but as the larger story itself.

1878
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:37,760
Where before the movies would explain a political crisis and the various parties therein, or

1879
01:34:37,760 --> 01:34:41,240
a personal conflict between characters with a lot of history, now the movie goes out of

1880
01:34:41,240 --> 01:34:42,800
its way to not explain anything at all.

1881
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:45,240
J.J. Abrams said he wanted the Star Wars comedy back.

1882
01:34:45,240 --> 01:34:49,280
But where before comedy accentuated characterization, here it undercuts it.

1883
01:34:49,280 --> 01:34:52,480
The characters in the setting are reset back to the way things were in A New Hope, only

1884
01:34:52,480 --> 01:34:53,640
this time with less explanation.

1885
01:34:53,640 --> 01:34:56,000
There's an empire and a rebellion with different names.

1886
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:59,120
Luke is isolated from everyone, Leia is a political leader fighting the power.

1887
01:34:59,240 --> 01:35:02,880
Han Solo is a smooth talker desperately trying to hide the fact that he's a broke bum.

1888
01:35:02,880 --> 01:35:06,620
All of the growth and change is reversed, so we can do Star Wars again.

1889
01:35:06,620 --> 01:35:08,240
What does The Last Jedi have to tell us?

1890
01:35:08,240 --> 01:35:10,920
Well, pretty much the opposite of The Force Awakens.

1891
01:35:10,920 --> 01:35:12,040
Star Wars is bad.

1892
01:35:12,040 --> 01:35:15,700
Where in Empire, Luke would never abandon his friends, and in Return of the Jedi, Luke

1893
01:35:15,700 --> 01:35:17,960
chose not to kill the defenseless.

1894
01:35:17,960 --> 01:35:21,000
Here we discover that Luke did both of those things in his old age.

1895
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:24,440
Everyone talks about the phrase, subverting expectations with this movie, and yeah, fair

1896
01:35:24,440 --> 01:35:25,440
enough.

1897
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:35,280
I don't want to go into just how bad this movie is right now.

1898
01:35:35,280 --> 01:35:39,560
This video is long enough, but I don't think the phrase, subvert expectations, is the ethic

1899
01:35:39,560 --> 01:35:40,560
of this movie.

1900
01:35:40,560 --> 01:35:42,680
Instead, it can be summed up in these scenes.

1901
01:35:42,680 --> 01:35:45,920
It's time to let old things die.

1902
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:57,480
Snoke, Skywalker, the Sith, the Jedi, the Rebels, let it all die.

1903
01:35:57,480 --> 01:36:03,480
Let the past die, kill it if you have to.

1904
01:36:03,480 --> 01:36:06,320
We have what they grow beyond.

1905
01:36:06,320 --> 01:36:11,440
That is the true burden of all masters.

1906
01:36:11,440 --> 01:36:13,680
The idea here is that Star Wars is changing.

1907
01:36:13,680 --> 01:36:16,280
It doesn't have to be about Skywalkers and Kenobi's anymore.

1908
01:36:16,280 --> 01:36:17,280
It can be about anybody.

1909
01:36:17,280 --> 01:36:18,940
That's the point of the final shot of the movie.

1910
01:36:18,940 --> 01:36:21,480
This kid isn't anybody important, and yet he can use the Force.

1911
01:36:21,480 --> 01:36:23,760
It's a grand moral equalization.

1912
01:36:23,760 --> 01:36:25,260
The old institutions don't matter.

1913
01:36:25,260 --> 01:36:28,680
We can make things how we want them to be, and they don't need to be Star Wars.

1914
01:36:28,680 --> 01:36:31,560
So what is the rise of Skywalker telling us then?

1915
01:36:31,560 --> 01:36:35,200
Well, the lesson of The Force Awakens is that we can no longer make anything new.

1916
01:36:35,200 --> 01:36:37,600
We must remain tethered to what Star Wars was.

1917
01:36:37,600 --> 01:36:40,960
At the same time, the lesson of The Last Jedi is that we can no longer hold on to anything

1918
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:41,960
old.

1919
01:36:41,960 --> 01:36:43,000
The slate must be wiped clean.

1920
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:46,240
Despite how it sounds, these two ideas actually fit together.

1921
01:36:46,240 --> 01:36:50,180
In a Hegelian sense, if The Force Awakens is the thesis and The Last Jedi is the antithesis,

1922
01:36:50,180 --> 01:36:52,120
The Rise of Skywalker is the synthesis.

1923
01:36:52,120 --> 01:36:55,460
It's a movie that is simultaneously tethered to the past while rejecting it.

1924
01:36:55,460 --> 01:37:00,160
It wipes the slate clean and then uses that space to build a simulacrum of what came before.

1925
01:37:00,160 --> 01:37:03,880
The ethics of Star Wars at this point are gone, and what remains is only the window

1926
01:37:03,880 --> 01:37:04,880
dressing.

1927
01:37:04,880 --> 01:37:08,160
There are X-wings and lightsabers and stormtroopers and star destroyers, but the core has been

1928
01:37:08,160 --> 01:37:09,160
hollowed out.

1929
01:37:09,160 --> 01:37:11,560
That's why it rings so hollow when Carrie Fisher says

1930
01:37:11,560 --> 01:37:15,560
It's about family, and that's what's so powerful about it.

1931
01:37:15,560 --> 01:37:16,560
We know they're not.

1932
01:37:16,560 --> 01:37:19,200
They're about being about family, which is a very different idea.

1933
01:37:19,200 --> 01:37:22,880
At least Mark Hamill was a lot more honest about them.

1934
01:37:22,880 --> 01:37:28,360
I said to Ryan, I said, I think I fundamentally disagree with pretty much everything you've

1935
01:37:28,360 --> 01:37:29,560
decided for me.

1936
01:37:29,560 --> 01:37:35,760
Now, having said that, I have to accept it, get my mind around it, and do my best to realize

1937
01:37:35,760 --> 01:37:36,760
your vision.

1938
01:37:36,760 --> 01:37:39,600
But I said to Ryan, I said, Jedis don't give up.

1939
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:46,640
I mean, even if he had a problem, he would maybe take a year to try and regroup.

1940
01:37:46,640 --> 01:37:49,200
But if he made a mistake, he would try and right that wrong.

1941
01:37:49,200 --> 01:37:51,400
So right there, we had a fundamental difference.

1942
01:37:51,400 --> 01:37:53,960
But it's not my story anymore.

1943
01:37:53,960 --> 01:37:59,160
It's somebody else's story, and Ryan needed me to be a certain way to make the ending

1944
01:37:59,160 --> 01:38:00,860
effective.

1945
01:38:00,860 --> 01:38:04,600
That's the crux of my problem.

1946
01:38:04,600 --> 01:38:06,680
Luke would never say that.

1947
01:38:06,680 --> 01:38:07,680
I'm sorry.

1948
01:38:07,680 --> 01:38:11,800
Well, in this version, see, I'm talking about the George Lucas Star Wars.

1949
01:38:11,800 --> 01:38:13,800
This is the next generation of Star Wars.

1950
01:38:13,800 --> 01:38:17,320
So I almost had to think of Luke as another character.

1951
01:38:17,320 --> 01:38:18,800
Maybe he's Jake Skywalker.

1952
01:38:18,800 --> 01:38:21,200
He's not my Luke Skywalker.

1953
01:38:21,200 --> 01:38:26,680
But I had to do what Ryan wanted me to do because it serves the story well.

1954
01:38:26,680 --> 01:38:29,560
But listen, I still haven't accepted it completely.

1955
01:38:29,560 --> 01:38:30,940
But it's only a movie.

1956
01:38:30,940 --> 01:38:32,040
I hope people like it.

1957
01:38:32,040 --> 01:38:33,320
I hope they don't get upset.

1958
01:38:33,320 --> 01:38:38,280
In other words, the Star Wars sequel trilogy teaches us how you build a progressive skin

1959
01:38:38,280 --> 01:38:39,280
suit.

1960
01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:43,440
First, stagnation is celebrated by way of worshipping the aesthetics of the Thing.

1961
01:38:43,440 --> 01:38:47,340
Secondly, revolution is celebrated by way of discrediting all the old ethical achievements

1962
01:38:47,340 --> 01:38:48,340
of the Thing.

1963
01:38:48,340 --> 01:38:52,440
Finally, these two ideas are married into a creation that is simply mechanical in how

1964
01:38:52,440 --> 01:38:53,700
it operates.

1965
01:38:53,700 --> 01:38:56,760
Scenes happen only because they must happen to reach the next scene.

1966
01:38:56,760 --> 01:39:00,880
Conflicts or revelations or sacrifices occur not because they further anything, but because

1967
01:39:00,880 --> 01:39:03,980
this is around the point in time the audience expects to see one.

1968
01:39:03,980 --> 01:39:07,600
Nothing makes sense, but nothing needs to because we've deconstructed the idea of

1969
01:39:07,600 --> 01:39:08,760
cause and effect.

1970
01:39:08,760 --> 01:39:13,480
Things might be set up and then paid off like in an actual movie, but there's no underlying

1971
01:39:13,480 --> 01:39:14,940
action and reaction.

1972
01:39:14,940 --> 01:39:16,820
The progressive skin suit is complete.

1973
01:39:16,820 --> 01:39:21,040
It looks like Star Wars, but deep inside it is in fact anti-Star Wars.

1974
01:39:21,040 --> 01:39:24,080
You can't even make new films anymore, not without disregarding 7, 8, and 9.

1975
01:39:24,080 --> 01:39:25,600
Where would you go with the story?

1976
01:39:25,600 --> 01:39:28,900
Everything's already been ruined by people who didn't care that they were ruining it.

1977
01:39:28,900 --> 01:39:32,400
Which makes it pretty fucking hilarious that Kathleen Kennedy complained there was no

1978
01:39:32,400 --> 01:39:37,360
more Star Wars stories to make, considering that Lucasfilm de-canonized nearly everything

1979
01:39:37,360 --> 01:39:39,040
and then deconstructed the rest.

1980
01:39:39,040 --> 01:39:42,380
And by the way, it should be no surprise that George Lucas isn't all that happy with how

1981
01:39:42,380 --> 01:39:43,380
it's going either.

1982
01:39:43,380 --> 01:39:46,140
Bob Iger said, gee, if you really want to sell your company, if you're thinking about

1983
01:39:46,140 --> 01:39:48,660
selling it, because we were talking about retirement and what are you going to do after

1984
01:39:48,660 --> 01:39:49,660
all this.

1985
01:39:49,660 --> 01:39:52,660
And he said, well, you really want to sell it, you know, we're very interested.

1986
01:39:52,660 --> 01:40:02,380
I sold them to the white slavers that take these things and I made a decision to move

1987
01:40:02,380 --> 01:40:05,800
ahead on the next Star Wars series and we were starting to do that.

1988
01:40:05,800 --> 01:40:08,820
So you were starting to make the next Star Wars?

1989
01:40:08,820 --> 01:40:09,820
Yeah.

1990
01:40:09,820 --> 01:40:11,960
You as director, filmmaker?

1991
01:40:11,960 --> 01:40:13,800
They wanted to do a retro movie.

1992
01:40:13,800 --> 01:40:14,800
I don't like that.

1993
01:40:14,800 --> 01:40:19,420
I like every movie, I worked very hard to make them different and make them completely

1994
01:40:19,420 --> 01:40:24,140
different with different planets, with different spaceships, with different, you know, to make

1995
01:40:24,140 --> 01:40:25,420
it new.

1996
01:40:25,420 --> 01:40:27,740
They decided they didn't want to use those stories.

1997
01:40:27,740 --> 01:40:29,260
They decided they were going to go do their own thing.

1998
01:40:29,260 --> 01:40:36,060
And so I decided fine, but basically I'm not going to try to, they weren't that keen to

1999
01:40:36,060 --> 01:40:37,060
have me involved anyway.

2000
01:40:37,060 --> 01:40:39,700
But at the same time, I said, I'm not going to, if I get in there, I'm just going to cause

2001
01:40:39,700 --> 01:40:42,540
trouble because they're not going to do what I want them to do.

2002
01:40:42,540 --> 01:40:44,580
So I don't have the control to do that anymore.

2003
01:40:44,580 --> 01:40:46,240
And all I would do is muck everything up.

2004
01:40:46,240 --> 01:40:49,440
Now then, let's finally return to the Obi-Wan Kenobi show.

2005
01:40:49,440 --> 01:40:52,440
Remember earlier when I said that the plot feels like it was written by an algorithm,

2006
01:40:52,440 --> 01:40:56,520
like they had this idea for the one truly emotional moment where Vader absolves Obi-Wan

2007
01:40:56,520 --> 01:41:00,680
of his guilt, and then just had a machine write a bunch of stuff that served no purpose

2008
01:41:00,680 --> 01:41:04,040
other than to get us there and fill the allotted time in the Disney Plus schedule?

2009
01:41:04,040 --> 01:41:06,020
Now you know why it feels that way.

2010
01:41:06,020 --> 01:41:10,880
The way I like to work is you try and come up with visual milestones of like, well, I'd

2011
01:41:10,880 --> 01:41:13,360
love to see this, and I'd love to see this, and I'd love to see this.

2012
01:41:13,360 --> 01:41:14,840
I'm not sure how they all connect.

2013
01:41:14,840 --> 01:41:19,640
And then what you do is you create visuals of things that would be great, and then you

2014
01:41:19,640 --> 01:41:21,760
try and find a way of linking them all.

2015
01:41:21,760 --> 01:41:25,440
And using this mode of analysis, you can go back and rewatch the gradual decline of any

2016
01:41:25,440 --> 01:41:29,280
property that covered up its failings by claiming to subvert expectations, and you'll probably

2017
01:41:29,280 --> 01:41:34,320
see the exact same process underneath of how they built the progressive skin suit.

2018
01:41:34,320 --> 01:41:37,840
We're, uh, we're not re-going over Obi-Wan again using this lens.

2019
01:41:37,840 --> 01:41:39,800
No thank you, you can do that on your own fucking time.

2020
01:41:39,800 --> 01:41:42,800
But I do want to give you one solid example from the show.

2021
01:41:42,840 --> 01:41:45,000
Everyone is coming their pants over Riva.

2022
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:48,520
She's so complex and deep, because she didn't kill young Luke, you guys.

2023
01:41:48,520 --> 01:41:52,280
The truth is, no, she's confused, which only has the appearance of complexity.

2024
01:41:52,280 --> 01:41:56,000
And in order for us to get to this moment, where Riva is broken and has to put herself

2025
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:59,820
back together again, the writers have to directly violate her established character.

2026
01:41:59,820 --> 01:42:02,280
That doesn't matter, only getting to the end result does.

2027
01:42:02,280 --> 01:42:04,600
Now compare Riva to Luke in The Empire Strikes Back.

2028
01:42:04,600 --> 01:42:06,400
Luke isn't confused like Riva is.

2029
01:42:06,400 --> 01:42:11,100
Rather, Luke's heroic traits are the cause of his downfall, and the Force itself is trying

2030
01:42:11,100 --> 01:42:12,200
to warn him.

2031
01:42:12,200 --> 01:42:16,720
Luke may enter a self-destructive spiral and hit rock bottom, but at no point does he ever

2032
01:42:16,720 --> 01:42:18,160
act out of character.

2033
01:42:18,160 --> 01:42:22,760
His loyalty, his impulsivity, and his bravery, all heroic traits, are what Vader uses to

2034
01:42:22,760 --> 01:42:24,120
draw him into his trap.

2035
01:42:24,120 --> 01:42:25,120
That's the difference.

2036
01:42:25,120 --> 01:42:28,160
The culmination of Luke's arc happens because of who he is.

2037
01:42:28,160 --> 01:42:31,880
The culmination of Riva's arc happens in spite of who she is.

2038
01:42:31,880 --> 01:42:34,440
But if you squint your eyes, it kind of looks the same.

2039
01:42:34,440 --> 01:42:36,920
So this is what Disney is going to be doing going forward.

2040
01:42:36,920 --> 01:42:41,120
Kenobi, and almost everything else that Disney has done since taking over Lucasfilm, is a

2041
01:42:41,120 --> 01:42:43,160
Star Wars homunculus.

2042
01:42:43,160 --> 01:42:46,800
This is the progressive skin suit, and Disney is hoping that you won't look close enough

2043
01:42:46,800 --> 01:42:54,260
to notice.

2044
01:42:54,260 --> 01:42:57,360
Of course, if you complain about any of this, you're a bigot.

2045
01:42:57,360 --> 01:43:01,600
It's not that you're a diehard fan who's dismayed at the cultural rot encroaching on the stuff

2046
01:43:01,600 --> 01:43:02,600
you grew up with.

2047
01:43:02,600 --> 01:43:04,780
The problem has to be you, not them.

2048
01:43:04,780 --> 01:43:05,780
Only kinda, though.

2049
01:43:05,780 --> 01:43:08,640
If the show is pro-progressive and you complain, you're the problem.

2050
01:43:08,640 --> 01:43:12,860
But if the show does something that progressives don't like, then it's the show's problem.

2051
01:43:12,860 --> 01:43:17,480
For example, back in May, when the first two episodes of Obi-Wan Kenobi dropped to an auditorium

2052
01:43:17,480 --> 01:43:21,440
full of devoted fans, after the initial screening, the audience took to Twitter to complain about

2053
01:43:21,440 --> 01:43:22,520
how triggering it was.

2054
01:43:22,520 --> 01:43:26,560
Remember, the show opens on Order 66, and it just so happens that the Uvalde school

2055
01:43:26,560 --> 01:43:28,280
shooting went down the same day.

2056
01:43:28,280 --> 01:43:32,400
And oh boy, the internet had no problem talking about how it was Disney's fault that they

2057
01:43:32,400 --> 01:43:35,980
didn't see the shooting coming and reschedule their premiere.

2058
01:43:35,980 --> 01:43:36,980
Trigger warning!

2059
01:43:36,980 --> 01:43:38,900
Had to pause and literally sob.

2060
01:43:38,900 --> 01:43:39,900
Huge trigger warning.

2061
01:43:39,900 --> 01:43:44,920
It literally starts off with the attack on Jedi younglings in their temple slash school.

2062
01:43:44,920 --> 01:43:47,140
What the fuck was Disney thinking?

2063
01:43:47,140 --> 01:43:49,520
Obi-Wan should have had trigger warnings after Uvalde.

2064
01:43:49,520 --> 01:43:51,060
That nearly made me vomit.

2065
01:43:51,060 --> 01:43:56,260
The cold open of Obi-Wan is a bunch of Jedi kids getting gunned down by stormtroopers.

2066
01:43:56,260 --> 01:43:58,020
And it's super fucking triggering.

2067
01:43:58,020 --> 01:44:00,540
And I literally can't believe they released that right now.

2068
01:44:00,540 --> 01:44:04,820
Hey Disney, given current events, can we add a content warning to the first episode of

2069
01:44:04,820 --> 01:44:05,820
Obi-Wan?

2070
01:44:05,860 --> 01:44:07,900
I'm too sick to my stomach just reading about it.

2071
01:44:07,900 --> 01:44:11,820
These people are fully grown adults who feel like shows targeted at their demographic,

2072
01:44:11,820 --> 01:44:15,980
you know, adults, are somehow too violent, to the point that they're protesting online.

2073
01:44:15,980 --> 01:44:19,660
And the violence we're talking about isn't like gratuitous gore or something.

2074
01:44:19,660 --> 01:44:22,540
It's people getting shot and stabbed with laser weapons.

2075
01:44:22,540 --> 01:44:25,220
Kids were sneaking in to see R-rated films in the 90s.

2076
01:44:25,220 --> 01:44:30,880
Now those same kids are soy boy adults crying that PG-13 is too much for them to handle.

2077
01:44:30,880 --> 01:44:34,500
Part of the progressive skin suit is rounding the corners, sanding down the bumps, making

2078
01:44:34,500 --> 01:44:39,100
everything appear epic but have no actual stakes because we can't let anybody get

2079
01:44:39,100 --> 01:44:40,420
emotionally upset.

2080
01:44:40,420 --> 01:44:48,240
So when a bit of the old lore filters through from the before times, when tragedies actually

2081
01:44:48,240 --> 01:44:52,100
happened in a narrative, these padded room zoomers can't fucking take it.

2082
01:44:52,100 --> 01:44:57,120
However, when actual Star Wars fans voiced their actual opinions on the actual problems

2083
01:44:57,120 --> 01:44:59,980
with the Obi-Wan show, doesn't matter which problem, take your pick.

2084
01:44:59,980 --> 01:45:02,340
I've given you over 9000 of them at this point.

2085
01:45:02,340 --> 01:45:05,380
Disney falls back on ol' reliable, racism.

2086
01:45:05,380 --> 01:45:10,460
The Star Wars fandom's racism problem, Moses Ingram, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and ongoing racist

2087
01:45:10,460 --> 01:45:14,700
toxicity in the Star Wars community, Ingram plays the main villain in the new Star Wars

2088
01:45:14,700 --> 01:45:17,720
show Obi-Wan Kenobi, a Jedi hunter named Riva.

2089
01:45:17,720 --> 01:45:22,460
After the series' debut, the actress, who is capital B Black, revealed on Instagram

2090
01:45:22,460 --> 01:45:26,140
she's been bombarded with hundreds of racism threatening messages, with one telling her

2091
01:45:26,140 --> 01:45:28,500
her days are numbered, and another using the N-word.

2092
01:45:28,500 --> 01:45:32,500
Damn, well, alright, let's head over to her Instagram and take a look.

2093
01:45:32,500 --> 01:45:36,140
Jesus, holy hell girl, what the fuck, why is that your avatar?

2094
01:45:36,140 --> 01:45:39,420
Uh, give me, give me a second, guys.

2095
01:45:39,420 --> 01:45:41,220
Alright, here's her Instagram video.

2096
01:45:41,220 --> 01:45:43,500
You suck, loser, you're a diversity hire.

2097
01:45:43,500 --> 01:45:46,580
Operation Get Behind the Darkies is real, JESUS CHRIST.

2098
01:45:46,580 --> 01:45:49,860
Ayo, Kenobi, you ain't finna run forever, white boy.

2099
01:45:49,860 --> 01:45:54,180
You have now been converted into the Saint George of Floydium of Star Wars.

2100
01:45:54,180 --> 01:45:57,020
How the fuck does an alien know Ebonics?

2101
01:45:57,020 --> 01:46:00,500
Yeah, this is pretty shitty.

2102
01:46:00,500 --> 01:46:03,460
There are hundreds of those.

2103
01:46:03,460 --> 01:46:05,740
Hundreds.

2104
01:46:05,740 --> 01:46:11,560
And I also see those of you out there who put on a cape for me, and that really does

2105
01:46:11,560 --> 01:46:21,880
mean the world to me, because, you know, there's nothing anybody can do about this.

2106
01:46:21,880 --> 01:46:26,300
There's nothing anybody can do to stop this hate.

2107
01:46:26,300 --> 01:46:31,720
And so I question what my purpose is, and even being here in front of you, saying that

2108
01:46:31,720 --> 01:46:37,280
this is happening.

2109
01:46:37,280 --> 01:46:39,560
I don't really know.

2110
01:46:39,560 --> 01:46:43,920
I don't really know.

2111
01:46:43,920 --> 01:46:51,440
But I think the thing that bothers me is that, like, sort of this feeling that I've had inside

2112
01:46:51,440 --> 01:46:55,880
of myself, which no one has told me, but this feeling of like, I just got to shut

2113
01:46:55,880 --> 01:47:00,520
up and take it, you know, I just kind of got to bury it.

2114
01:47:00,520 --> 01:47:01,940
And I'm not built like that.

2115
01:47:01,940 --> 01:47:09,080
So I really just wanted to come on, I think, and say thank you to the people who show up

2116
01:47:09,080 --> 01:47:14,440
for me in the comments and the places that I'm not gonna put myself.

2117
01:47:14,440 --> 01:47:20,360
And to the rest of y'all, y'all weird.

2118
01:47:20,360 --> 01:47:23,920
Shiva is kind of a garbage character, but Moses Ingram was pretty good in the Queen's

2119
01:47:23,920 --> 01:47:24,920
Gambit.

2120
01:47:24,920 --> 01:47:26,240
She's probably a fine person in private.

2121
01:47:26,240 --> 01:47:27,240
It's not her fault.

2122
01:47:27,240 --> 01:47:30,740
I've never really liked the idea of attacking an actor or actress just because the character

2123
01:47:30,740 --> 01:47:35,600
they play is evil, or worse, badly written, or worse, badly acted.

2124
01:47:35,600 --> 01:47:39,640
Best case scenario on the side of the angry fans, it's not Moses Ingram's fault that Star

2125
01:47:39,640 --> 01:47:41,820
Wars writers were looking for a diversity hire.

2126
01:47:41,820 --> 01:47:42,820
That's Disney's fault.

2127
01:47:42,820 --> 01:47:45,640
She was just taking the job she was offered, like anybody reasonable would.

2128
01:47:45,640 --> 01:47:46,880
You gotta chase that paper.

2129
01:47:46,880 --> 01:47:49,180
Personally, I think she did an okay job with what she was given.

2130
01:47:49,180 --> 01:47:50,980
She was just given garbage.

2131
01:47:50,980 --> 01:47:55,340
After her video went viral, Owen McGregor recorded his own to show his support.

2132
01:47:55,340 --> 01:48:01,900
This weekend, Star Wars fans made Obi-Wan Kenobi the most watched Disney Plus original

2133
01:48:01,900 --> 01:48:04,360
series premiere of all time.

2134
01:48:04,360 --> 01:48:07,380
And for that, I would say a big thank you.

2135
01:48:07,380 --> 01:48:12,740
And it just goes to show what this family can do when we all pull together.

2136
01:48:12,740 --> 01:48:19,220
However, it seems that some of the fan base from this influential fan base have decided

2137
01:48:19,220 --> 01:48:25,400
to attack Moses Ingram online and send her the most horrendous racist DMs.

2138
01:48:25,400 --> 01:48:29,640
And I heard some of them this morning and it just broke my heart.

2139
01:48:29,640 --> 01:48:31,460
Moses is a brilliant actor.

2140
01:48:31,460 --> 01:48:33,020
She's a brilliant woman.

2141
01:48:33,020 --> 01:48:35,340
And she's absolutely amazing in this series.

2142
01:48:35,340 --> 01:48:39,260
She brings so much to the series, she brings so much to the franchise.

2143
01:48:39,260 --> 01:48:43,220
And it just sickened me to my stomach to hear that this had been happening.

2144
01:48:43,220 --> 01:48:49,020
I just want to say as the leading actor in the series, as the executive producer in the

2145
01:48:49,020 --> 01:48:52,260
series, that we stand with Moses.

2146
01:48:52,260 --> 01:48:53,540
We love Moses.

2147
01:48:53,540 --> 01:48:56,700
Again, mostly a completely reasonable response.

2148
01:48:56,700 --> 01:48:58,160
Anybody who's worked on a set will tell you.

2149
01:48:58,160 --> 01:49:01,340
The lead actor is like the informal dad of the set family.

2150
01:49:01,340 --> 01:49:03,580
He's probably feeling protective of Ingram right now.

2151
01:49:03,580 --> 01:49:06,100
However, where he goes off the rails is at the end.

2152
01:49:06,100 --> 01:49:11,140
And if you're sending her bullying messages, you're no Star Wars fan in my mind.

2153
01:49:11,140 --> 01:49:13,980
There's no place for racism in this world.

2154
01:49:13,980 --> 01:49:17,020
And I totally stand with Moses.

2155
01:49:17,020 --> 01:49:19,780
I'm not simping for the racists here, all right?

2156
01:49:19,780 --> 01:49:24,820
But as objectionable as I find them, you absolutely can like Star Wars and be a racist.

2157
01:49:24,820 --> 01:49:25,820
They're unrelated things.

2158
01:49:25,820 --> 01:49:26,940
Here's a funny thing, though.

2159
01:49:26,940 --> 01:49:29,280
Moses Ingram's video dropped on May 31st.

2160
01:49:29,280 --> 01:49:34,460
But on May 22nd, five days before parts one and two of the show were released, Moses Ingram

2161
01:49:34,460 --> 01:49:37,260
gave this interview with The Independent, where she said,

2162
01:49:37,260 --> 01:49:40,940
Obi-Wan is going to bring the most diversity I think we've seen in the galaxy before.

2163
01:49:40,940 --> 01:49:42,020
To me, it's long overdue.

2164
01:49:42,020 --> 01:49:45,740
If you've got talking droids and aliens, but no people of color, it doesn't make any sense.

2165
01:49:45,740 --> 01:49:46,740
It's 2022, you know.

2166
01:49:46,740 --> 01:49:48,780
So we're just at the beginning of that change.

2167
01:49:48,780 --> 01:49:51,300
But I think to start that change is better than never having started.

2168
01:49:51,300 --> 01:49:52,820
Are you butt fucking kidding me?

2169
01:49:52,820 --> 01:49:54,260
What about Lando Calrissian?

2170
01:49:54,260 --> 01:49:55,260
Mace Windu?

2171
01:49:55,260 --> 01:49:56,260
Jango Fett?

2172
01:49:56,260 --> 01:49:59,100
Maybe the problem isn't that Star Wars lacks people of color.

2173
01:49:59,100 --> 01:50:02,980
It's that the new people of color being brought on aren't actually very good at their jobs.

2174
01:50:02,980 --> 01:50:06,320
Hell, there's new people of color being brought on that are doing pretty good jobs.

2175
01:50:06,320 --> 01:50:08,360
So maybe the issue isn't race.

2176
01:50:08,360 --> 01:50:12,620
It's no secret that, for example, Jake Lloyd's life has completely fallen apart since the

2177
01:50:12,620 --> 01:50:16,860
Phantom Menace, and he lays at least part of the blame at the feet of Star Wars fans

2178
01:50:16,860 --> 01:50:19,660
who treated him exceptionally poorly when he was a child.

2179
01:50:19,660 --> 01:50:21,140
And you know, fair enough.

2180
01:50:21,140 --> 01:50:22,540
But Lloyd's white.

2181
01:50:22,540 --> 01:50:26,400
Maybe you can make an argument that some parts of the Star Wars fandom is toxic.

2182
01:50:26,400 --> 01:50:29,220
But is that problem based on race?

2183
01:50:29,220 --> 01:50:30,220
Absolutely not.

2184
01:50:30,460 --> 01:50:33,740
Billy Dee Williams was considered the smoothest dude in the original trilogy.

2185
01:50:33,740 --> 01:50:36,060
That guy broke out the Colt .45 after every scene.

2186
01:50:36,060 --> 01:50:41,420
She's pouring a Colt .45, and we all know what that means.

2187
01:50:41,420 --> 01:50:43,780
You mind if I join you?

2188
01:50:43,780 --> 01:50:46,220
You must have read my mind.

2189
01:50:46,220 --> 01:50:47,420
Something like that.

2190
01:50:47,420 --> 01:50:52,740
I find the idea that Star Wars fans are just blanket racist really hard to buy.

2191
01:50:52,740 --> 01:50:55,260
It just doesn't track with reality.

2192
01:50:55,260 --> 01:50:59,460
Here's some classic Star Wars fans on the eve of the release of The Return of the Jedi.

2193
01:50:59,580 --> 01:51:02,180
All I've got to say, the Jedi have returned.

2194
01:51:02,180 --> 01:51:05,140
We're just fanatics out here waiting on Return of the Jedi.

2195
01:51:05,140 --> 01:51:06,140
Three years in the making.

2196
01:51:06,140 --> 01:51:07,140
We're waiting for this.

2197
01:51:07,140 --> 01:51:10,180
Some people don't idolize Darth Vader like I do.

2198
01:51:10,180 --> 01:51:12,700
See, I want him to get Luke.

2199
01:51:12,700 --> 01:51:17,140
And I think that Luke will destroy Darth Vader.

2200
01:51:17,140 --> 01:51:18,420
I guess Darth Vader will die.

2201
01:51:18,420 --> 01:51:19,420
I'm not sure.

2202
01:51:19,420 --> 01:51:20,420
I hope he doesn't.

2203
01:51:20,420 --> 01:51:21,420
I love his black.

2204
01:51:21,420 --> 01:51:24,180
I think it's surprising to see all of them together at the end playing pinochle and having

2205
01:51:24,180 --> 01:51:25,180
a great time.

2206
01:51:25,180 --> 01:51:27,860
I wish I was there, and I'm going to try to get a part of the next movie myself.

2207
01:51:27,860 --> 01:51:31,460
This has left me practically utterly speechless, actually, you know, but it was the best one

2208
01:51:31,460 --> 01:51:32,460
ever.

2209
01:51:32,460 --> 01:51:36,980
The big surprise was seeing Darth Vader unveil himself to his son.

2210
01:51:36,980 --> 01:51:37,980
It was very exciting.

2211
01:51:37,980 --> 01:51:38,980
The biggest surprise?

2212
01:51:38,980 --> 01:51:40,980
Well, I don't want to give it away to anybody.

2213
01:51:40,980 --> 01:51:44,180
Do you think it was worth coming to this late at night?

2214
01:51:44,180 --> 01:51:45,180
Yeah.

2215
01:51:45,180 --> 01:51:46,660
Looks like it's straight out of a KKK meeting.

2216
01:51:46,660 --> 01:51:47,660
Am I right, guys?

2217
01:51:47,660 --> 01:51:51,660
Ingram also stated, This was something that Lucasfilm actually got in front of and said,

2218
01:51:51,660 --> 01:51:55,020
This is a thing that unfortunately likely will happen, but we are here to help you.

2219
01:51:55,020 --> 01:51:56,420
You can let us know when it happens.

2220
01:51:56,420 --> 01:51:58,740
Disney is referring to her getting racist DMS and stuff.

2221
01:51:58,740 --> 01:52:00,740
They knew this was going to happen before it did.

2222
01:52:00,740 --> 01:52:02,460
So good faith to Disney.

2223
01:52:02,460 --> 01:52:05,560
Everybody should recognize that some people online are just assholes.

2224
01:52:05,560 --> 01:52:06,560
That's it.

2225
01:52:06,560 --> 01:52:10,260
They are going to say racist shit in the DMS, even if you do an amazing job.

2226
01:52:10,260 --> 01:52:14,820
But if Disney knows the show is going to be bad, getting ahead of it might entail spinning

2227
01:52:14,820 --> 01:52:19,220
up a story of racism before any such racism even happens as a defense.

2228
01:52:19,220 --> 01:52:23,440
Therefore, the guy who's actually in Moses Ingram's DMS being a racist and the guy who

2229
01:52:23,440 --> 01:52:27,480
thinks the Obi Wan show sucks and has real complaints because Disney got out ahead of

2230
01:52:27,480 --> 01:52:28,480
the story.

2231
01:52:28,480 --> 01:52:29,800
They can spin it like those two are linked.

2232
01:52:29,800 --> 01:52:33,400
The most cynical part of my brain thinks they might have actually planned this, like, Oh,

2233
01:52:33,400 --> 01:52:35,480
thank God Moses Ingram got sent racist messages.

2234
01:52:35,480 --> 01:52:38,800
Now we can go to Twitter and activate the woke spin cycle and generate some press for

2235
01:52:38,800 --> 01:52:40,520
this god awful show of ours.

2236
01:52:40,520 --> 01:52:41,520
And you know what?

2237
01:52:41,520 --> 01:52:42,520
That's exactly what they did.

2238
01:52:42,520 --> 01:52:44,240
Here's the official Star Wars Twitter account.

2239
01:52:44,240 --> 01:52:48,400
We are proud to welcome Moses Ingram to the Star Wars family, and we're excited for Reeva's

2240
01:52:48,400 --> 01:52:49,500
story to unfold.

2241
01:52:49,500 --> 01:52:53,700
If anyone intends to make her feel in any way unwelcome, we have only one thing to say

2242
01:52:53,700 --> 01:52:55,020
we resist.

2243
01:52:55,020 --> 01:52:58,760
There are more than 20 million sentient species in the Star Wars galaxy.

2244
01:52:58,760 --> 01:53:00,280
Don't choose to be a racist.

2245
01:53:00,280 --> 01:53:01,940
Make it all about the controversy guys.

2246
01:53:01,940 --> 01:53:06,120
Don't talk about the show's shoddy writing or middling quality or awful new characters.

2247
01:53:06,120 --> 01:53:07,800
Make it all about racism.

2248
01:53:07,800 --> 01:53:12,440
Two black female Star Wars characters, one liked and the other disliked by fans, almost

2249
01:53:12,440 --> 01:53:14,860
as if it is less about demographics than quality.

2250
01:53:14,860 --> 01:53:17,820
This is literally the I have a black friend argument.

2251
01:53:17,820 --> 01:53:22,340
Being racist does not just refer to donning a white hood and being overtly racist.

2252
01:53:22,340 --> 01:53:26,420
It also includes things like implicit bias, you can like some black characters and still

2253
01:53:26,420 --> 01:53:27,420
be a racist.

2254
01:53:27,420 --> 01:53:28,840
Man, I've never understood this.

2255
01:53:28,840 --> 01:53:31,800
Why would a black person still be friends with somebody who's a racist?

2256
01:53:31,800 --> 01:53:34,460
Why would a racist still like black characters and actors?

2257
01:53:34,460 --> 01:53:38,160
Where's the implicit bias when you think that Reeva fucking sucks as a villain?

2258
01:53:38,160 --> 01:53:41,460
You know, I'm just not willing to take any fucking guff from the company that puts this

2259
01:53:41,460 --> 01:53:46,400
woke virtue signaling shit out on Twitter, while at the same time actually acting overtly

2260
01:53:46,400 --> 01:53:49,500
racist and homophobic themselves in the overseas markets.

2261
01:53:49,500 --> 01:53:53,300
If you're not willing to stand up for your values, where and when it matters, when you

2262
01:53:53,300 --> 01:53:57,340
have something to lose, then they're not values, and I'm not going to be preached at about

2263
01:53:57,340 --> 01:53:58,340
them by you.

2264
01:53:58,340 --> 01:54:02,400
I'm certainly not going to get preached at when the same fan backlash shit happened to

2265
01:54:02,400 --> 01:54:07,620
Mandalorian actress Gina Carano because she was anti-ACAB during the Summer of Love 2020

2266
01:54:07,620 --> 01:54:09,620
and she lost her fucking job over it.

2267
01:54:09,620 --> 01:54:10,620
Remember that shit?

2268
01:54:10,620 --> 01:54:14,620
Carano did all the things that you don't do as an arm of the Star Wars corporal progressive

2269
01:54:14,620 --> 01:54:15,860
subversion machine.

2270
01:54:15,860 --> 01:54:19,900
Make jokes about masks, talk about her belief in the 2020 election fraud, don't put pronouns

2271
01:54:19,900 --> 01:54:21,820
in your bio, oh my god.

2272
01:54:21,820 --> 01:54:25,340
I think the star that finally broke the camel's back was when she compared hating people for

2273
01:54:25,340 --> 01:54:29,120
their political views to the persecution of Jews from the Holocaust.

2274
01:54:29,120 --> 01:54:31,540
And fair enough, that's pretty fucking spicy, isn't it?

2275
01:54:31,540 --> 01:54:35,580
But hey, how does that one poem go that leftoids always like to cite?

2276
01:54:35,580 --> 01:54:37,420
First they came for the socialists.

2277
01:54:37,420 --> 01:54:42,540
Why isn't this a case of comparing a political affiliation to the persecution of the Jews?

2278
01:54:42,540 --> 01:54:45,540
This is, in fact, something that people on the left always do.

2279
01:54:45,540 --> 01:54:49,180
Compare the persecution of leftist activists to other historical horrors.

2280
01:54:49,180 --> 01:54:53,240
Even though there are just as many historical horrors where leftists come after who they

2281
01:54:53,240 --> 01:54:57,020
deem to be counter-revolutionary or reactionary or whatever.

2282
01:54:57,020 --> 01:55:01,540
It's almost like, despite the obvious hyperbole of Carano's claims, the ultimate issue is

2283
01:55:01,540 --> 01:55:05,800
that only one political camp is allowed the privilege associated with being a victim.

2284
01:55:05,800 --> 01:55:06,860
But you know what?

2285
01:55:06,860 --> 01:55:11,180
Not only did they have no problem at all with Gia Carano before she posted any of the spicy

2286
01:55:11,180 --> 01:55:15,940
stuff, they actually claimed the sexist, racist, toxic fanbase that was Star Wars was

2287
01:55:15,940 --> 01:55:18,940
triggered when she first joined up with the franchise.

2288
01:55:18,940 --> 01:55:19,940
Really?

2289
01:55:19,940 --> 01:55:23,780
The same people who you now claim are her most ardent alt-right supporters or whatever

2290
01:55:23,780 --> 01:55:24,780
the fuck?

2291
01:55:24,780 --> 01:55:26,580
There is nothing these people wouldn't say.

2292
01:55:26,580 --> 01:55:29,420
No lie they wouldn't tell to further their agenda.

2293
01:55:29,420 --> 01:55:31,140
By the way, that alt-right thing?

2294
01:55:31,140 --> 01:55:35,300
It turns out that most of the complaints about The Last Jedi came from the same Twitter accounts

2295
01:55:35,300 --> 01:55:39,740
that were considered Russian bots and plants during the 2016 election, making them all

2296
01:55:39,740 --> 01:55:40,740
part of the alt-right.

2297
01:55:40,740 --> 01:55:44,340
Or maybe average people are just fed up with your shit, Disney.

2298
01:55:44,340 --> 01:55:46,100
You're alt-right if you hate Star Wars.

2299
01:55:46,100 --> 01:55:47,980
It's the fans' fault that Star Wars sucks.

2300
01:55:47,980 --> 01:55:49,340
The Force is female.

2301
01:55:49,340 --> 01:55:52,100
Anakin Skywalker fell because of toxic masculinity.

2302
01:55:52,100 --> 01:55:54,500
Watch the all-female Star Wars or you're a bigot.

2303
01:55:54,500 --> 01:55:56,780
If you negatively review Star Wars, you're a bigot.

2304
01:55:56,780 --> 01:55:59,540
Except Obi-Wan is LGBT or you're a bigot.

2305
01:55:59,540 --> 01:56:01,580
I swear to fucking god.

2306
01:56:01,580 --> 01:56:06,360
Consume product to defeat my cultural enemies regardless of its quality or my personal enjoyment

2307
01:56:06,360 --> 01:56:09,540
of it is the greatest marketing gimmick ever conceived.

2308
01:56:09,540 --> 01:56:13,540
And now they want to do the same thing they did to Gia Carano to Rosario Dawson, the actress

2309
01:56:13,540 --> 01:56:18,180
playing Ahsoka Tano, despite her being quite left-leaning, because at one point a trans

2310
01:56:18,180 --> 01:56:24,900
man filed a lawsuit against her for discrimination, verbal abuse, physical assault, and misgendering.

2311
01:56:24,900 --> 01:56:26,760
I guess that's illegal in California.

2312
01:56:26,760 --> 01:56:30,300
Even though the lawsuit was dropped because there was just nothing fucking to it, people

2313
01:56:30,300 --> 01:56:32,700
still want her out of the Ahsoka show.

2314
01:56:32,700 --> 01:56:37,500
These people are so deep down the rabbit hole that even being innocent of the crime that

2315
01:56:37,500 --> 01:56:39,900
they're accused of is not enough for them.

2316
01:56:39,900 --> 01:56:44,140
Some people are saying that Obi-Wan was purposely brought low in order to pump Riva up and that

2317
01:56:44,140 --> 01:56:45,220
might be the case.

2318
01:56:45,220 --> 01:56:47,620
That doesn't bother me the way that it does a lot of other fans.

2319
01:56:47,620 --> 01:56:51,740
I don't mind a story where an old hero is taken down a peg or two and has to, you know,

2320
01:56:51,740 --> 01:56:52,940
get his mojo back.

2321
01:56:52,940 --> 01:56:54,620
But it has to be justified.

2322
01:56:54,620 --> 01:56:59,060
And in the Obi-Wan show, one of the only things going for it is that Obi-Wan's descent is

2323
01:56:59,060 --> 01:57:00,380
actually pretty justified.

2324
01:57:00,380 --> 01:57:02,660
He's lost everything here and it's all his fault.

2325
01:57:02,660 --> 01:57:06,300
Compare that to The Last Jedi, where with Luke they explicitly avoid fleshing out the

2326
01:57:06,300 --> 01:57:07,300
justification.

2327
01:57:07,300 --> 01:57:11,260
Compare it to Star Trek Discovery, where the beloved character of Spock plays second fiddle

2328
01:57:11,260 --> 01:57:14,900
to his secret until now unknown stepsister Michael Burnham.

2329
01:57:14,900 --> 01:57:18,020
There are many cases where this criticism makes sense, that in order to privilege the

2330
01:57:18,020 --> 01:57:21,860
new characters and stories they want to tell, they just shit all over the established characters.

2331
01:57:21,860 --> 01:57:23,260
But that doesn't work here.

2332
01:57:23,260 --> 01:57:25,120
Obi-Wan's downfall is actually believable.

2333
01:57:25,120 --> 01:57:28,280
I just wish that it was in the service of somebody better than Riva.

2334
01:57:28,280 --> 01:57:30,760
The Star Wars Twitter account is always doing shit like this.

2335
01:57:30,760 --> 01:57:34,900
For example, for Pride Month this year, they released this comic starring two gay chicks

2336
01:57:34,900 --> 01:57:35,900
as bounty hunters.

2337
01:57:35,900 --> 01:57:38,980
Now listen, you know I have no problem with lesbians, that's some pretty good shit.

2338
01:57:38,980 --> 01:57:41,700
But I also have no problem with casual incidental homosexuality.

2339
01:57:41,700 --> 01:57:45,340
Like recently, everyone was losing their mind over the lesbian couple in the Buzz Lightyear

2340
01:57:45,340 --> 01:57:46,700
movie and it's like, who cares?

2341
01:57:46,700 --> 01:57:48,460
They're just chilling, it's whatever.

2342
01:57:48,460 --> 01:57:53,020
I'm even fine with a story about homosexuality specifically, where it's not just incidental

2343
01:57:53,020 --> 01:57:55,820
gayness, but where gayness actually drives the plot.

2344
01:57:55,820 --> 01:58:00,620
One of my favorite anime of all time, the 1997 masterpiece Revolutionary Girl Utena,

2345
01:58:00,620 --> 01:58:04,000
is a show specifically about lesbianism and gender-bending.

2346
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:08,420
It is impossible to do this show's plot without the gay and queer aspects of it.

2347
01:58:08,420 --> 01:58:12,360
It is built from the foundation up to be that type of show, and it's done very well.

2348
01:58:12,360 --> 01:58:13,360
But that's the point.

2349
01:58:13,360 --> 01:58:16,200
Utena is designed to be that story, but Star Wars isn't.

2350
01:58:16,200 --> 01:58:19,560
There's nothing in the fabric of the Star Wars universe that demands queerness.

2351
01:58:19,560 --> 01:58:23,500
Meanwhile, this comic also isn't the incidental gayness of Lightyear either.

2352
01:58:23,500 --> 01:58:27,220
This is not a Star Wars story with Star Wars characters that just so happen to be gay.

2353
01:58:27,220 --> 01:58:30,640
This is a gay story wearing the Star Wars progressive skin suit.

2354
01:58:30,640 --> 01:58:34,360
So of course somebody replies with, don't make Star Wars political.

2355
01:58:34,360 --> 01:58:37,620
Oh, you poor brave soul, F's in the chat.

2356
01:58:37,620 --> 01:58:42,160
The Star Wars official Twitter account replied with, queer characters existing isn't political,

2357
01:58:42,160 --> 01:58:44,260
and Star Wars is literally in our name.

2358
01:58:44,260 --> 01:58:48,160
You know, for a political faction that talks about responsible platforming, use of social

2359
01:58:48,160 --> 01:58:51,960
media, punching down, a faction that I'm sure the Disney intern running the Star Wars

2360
01:58:51,960 --> 01:58:56,140
account is a part of, you'd think they'd know not to sic their huge following on a

2361
01:58:56,140 --> 01:58:57,520
smaller private account.

2362
01:58:57,520 --> 01:58:59,840
Though I'm sure they actually knew exactly what would happen.

2363
01:58:59,840 --> 01:59:02,240
Look at the fucking rage of all these replies.

2364
01:59:02,240 --> 01:59:05,380
Here's another one, calling all members of the Resistance, Billie Lourd and Kelly Marie

2365
01:59:05,380 --> 01:59:06,800
Trainor taking the stage now.

2366
01:59:06,800 --> 01:59:08,880
Respectfully, nobody likes either of them.

2367
01:59:08,880 --> 01:59:13,440
Respectfully, L plus ratio, geez, maybe the Disney intern is actually Kefls.

2368
01:59:13,440 --> 01:59:16,000
And the exact same thing happened to this poor bastard too.

2369
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,800
Get his ass, get his ass, get their ass, I guess this one's inclusive.

2370
01:59:18,800 --> 01:59:21,500
Get his ass, get his ass, yeah, let's go, get their ass.

2371
01:59:21,500 --> 01:59:26,040
It's often said by left-oid screeching about right-oid YouTubers or even apolitical YouTubers

2372
01:59:26,040 --> 01:59:30,480
that people in positions of influence online have a moral obligation to tilt their audiences

2373
01:59:30,480 --> 01:59:34,840
towards good behavior and that the harassment that pours out of right-wing communities reflects

2374
01:59:34,840 --> 01:59:37,900
on both the politics and the individuals within those communities.

2375
01:59:37,900 --> 01:59:41,560
If we accept this logic, what does it say about progressive communities that individuals

2376
01:59:41,560 --> 01:59:46,400
within them have no problem being grotesquely racist towards black people who aren't progressive?

2377
01:59:46,400 --> 01:59:49,880
You know, at this point, if you're anti-BLM or something, you're a member of the actual

2378
01:59:49,880 --> 01:59:50,880
Resistance.

2379
01:59:50,880 --> 01:59:52,360
These people are a fucking monolith.

2380
01:59:52,360 --> 01:59:56,760
The most important type of reply out of this officially sanctioned Star Wars dogpile, though,

2381
01:59:56,760 --> 01:59:59,800
were the people who were claiming that Star Wars is actually political.

2382
01:59:59,800 --> 02:00:04,080
And yes, the left-oid answer is the everything-is-political position, stemming out of Antonio Gramsci's

2383
02:00:04,080 --> 02:00:07,840
theory of cultural hegemony, describing how before the working class can revolt against

2384
02:00:07,840 --> 02:00:12,160
the bourgeoisie, first they must be indoctrinated within an alternate culture that is pro-revolution.

2385
02:00:12,160 --> 02:00:16,080
The crafting of that culture requires the subversion of mass media to deconstruct morality

2386
02:00:16,080 --> 02:00:20,360
and heroism for the masses, and within that resulting cultural vacuum, push pro-socialist

2387
02:00:20,360 --> 02:00:21,360
propaganda.

2388
02:00:21,360 --> 02:00:25,240
If you want to know why so many new properties are garbage that promote communism and progressivism,

2389
02:00:25,240 --> 02:00:29,160
while so many reinventions of old properties are simply lessons in how to subvert them,

2390
02:00:29,160 --> 02:00:30,160
this is why.

2391
02:00:30,160 --> 02:00:33,440
Gramsci's time will come on this channel eventually, but for our purposes here, Star

2392
02:00:33,440 --> 02:00:37,640
Wars is political because when George Lucas chose to base his stories on the specific

2393
02:00:37,640 --> 02:00:42,080
hero myths and morals that he did, to a reader of Gramsci, that choice was not a neutral

2394
02:00:42,080 --> 02:00:43,080
one.

2395
02:00:43,080 --> 02:00:45,080
It did not exist within a political or cultural vacuum.

2396
02:00:45,080 --> 02:00:49,920
Rather, it led new generations of people to idolize specific types of heroes, and as those

2397
02:00:49,920 --> 02:00:53,800
children became politically active adults, the particular cultural morality they grew

2398
02:00:53,800 --> 02:00:55,000
up with informed their politics.

2399
02:00:55,000 --> 02:01:01,080
One of the themes of the movie is high technology and romance.

2400
02:01:01,080 --> 02:01:03,560
They're romantic human.

2401
02:01:03,560 --> 02:01:09,280
One of the human qualities is that romantic quality, that quality of honor and justice

2402
02:01:09,280 --> 02:01:15,440
and everything that we equate as human in the way we focus and conduct our lives.

2403
02:01:15,440 --> 02:01:20,520
In this particular case, I was looking for a symbol of sort of a more humane, honorable

2404
02:01:20,520 --> 02:01:27,120
way of being a warrior, as opposed to the mechanical, heartless, machine-like approach

2405
02:01:27,120 --> 02:01:30,260
to killing and battle and war.

2406
02:01:30,260 --> 02:01:34,800
One of the main influences here was the samurai ethic and King Arthur and the King Arthur

2407
02:01:34,800 --> 02:01:40,840
ethic where you have a very strong set of ethical rules that you live by.

2408
02:01:40,840 --> 02:01:46,860
The lightsaber became the symbol of that humane way of conducting your life.

2409
02:01:46,860 --> 02:01:51,080
In this way, Star Wars is political because the progs view it as a vehicle to influence

2410
02:01:51,080 --> 02:01:52,600
political change in the next generation.

2411
02:01:52,600 --> 02:01:56,760
It's not valued by them for the artistry of the thing, but only for its real-world

2412
02:01:56,760 --> 02:01:57,760
impact.

2413
02:01:57,760 --> 02:01:59,320
In other words, it's the progressive skin suit.

2414
02:01:59,320 --> 02:02:03,080
Probably the greatest bulwark against the Gramsciate cultural subversives is literally

2415
02:02:03,080 --> 02:02:04,120
voting with your wallet.

2416
02:02:04,120 --> 02:02:08,520
A piece of media that lacks a soul and only exists to enact political or cultural change

2417
02:02:08,520 --> 02:02:10,300
is generally not of high quality.

2418
02:02:10,340 --> 02:02:14,140
This is the source of the get woke, go broke phenomenon, but it was identified by George

2419
02:02:14,140 --> 02:02:17,060
Lucas as an issue long before that phrase became popular.

2420
02:02:17,060 --> 02:02:20,780
When Star Wars came out, everybody said, oh, it's a silly movie.

2421
02:02:20,780 --> 02:02:24,660
It's just a bunch of space battles and stuff.

2422
02:02:24,660 --> 02:02:25,900
It's not real.

2423
02:02:25,900 --> 02:02:27,020
There's nothing behind it.

2424
02:02:27,020 --> 02:02:29,140
And I said, well, there is stuff behind it.

2425
02:02:29,140 --> 02:02:30,740
It's not just a space battle.

2426
02:02:30,740 --> 02:02:32,260
There's more to it than that.

2427
02:02:32,260 --> 02:02:34,560
It's much, much more complicated than that.

2428
02:02:34,560 --> 02:02:40,880
So the spaceships and that part of the science, fantasy, whatever, got terribly abused.

2429
02:02:40,880 --> 02:02:45,240
And of course, everybody went out and made spaceship movies and they were all horrible

2430
02:02:45,240 --> 02:02:47,160
and they all lost tons of money.

2431
02:02:47,160 --> 02:02:49,220
And you say, well, you know, there's more to it than that.

2432
02:02:49,220 --> 02:02:51,320
You can't just go out and do spaceships.

2433
02:02:51,320 --> 02:02:55,880
Earlier, when I alluded to just how many properties beyond Star Wars have been turned into subversive

2434
02:02:55,880 --> 02:03:00,380
vehicles, you should be able to notice intuitively that they all went through this process.

2435
02:03:00,380 --> 02:03:03,480
The stripping of initial meaning, co-opting of the aesthetic, and the replacement of the

2436
02:03:03,480 --> 02:03:07,900
core with politics and the fans almost always react negatively, which is why the new creators

2437
02:03:07,900 --> 02:03:11,640
attack their fans as a last ditch effort to try and get them in line, which only exacerbates

2438
02:03:11,640 --> 02:03:12,640
the problem.

2439
02:03:12,640 --> 02:03:16,100
But with something as big as popular as Star Wars, where legitimately bad movies still

2440
02:03:16,100 --> 02:03:20,000
turn a profit, the get woke, go broke effect takes some time to build up.

2441
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:23,920
Unlike with, for example, American comics, which are getting absolutely dominated by

2442
02:03:23,920 --> 02:03:27,400
Japanese manga right now, to the point that the industry is collapsing because nobody's

2443
02:03:27,400 --> 02:03:28,480
reading them anymore.

2444
02:03:28,480 --> 02:03:31,520
Star Wars started with enough of a head start that it's going to take more than your average

2445
02:03:31,520 --> 02:03:33,240
failure to kill off the franchise.

2446
02:03:33,240 --> 02:03:36,240
But we've still seen those preliminary symptoms rear their heads.

2447
02:03:36,240 --> 02:03:40,080
Nobody's buying the Rose Tico action figure or whatever else because nobody likes these

2448
02:03:40,080 --> 02:03:41,080
characters.

2449
02:03:41,080 --> 02:03:43,640
The days of this stuff being collectible are over.

2450
02:03:43,640 --> 02:03:48,760
Just a few more strokes and all of the Bubba Fett action figures on Esau will be mine.

2451
02:03:48,760 --> 02:03:49,760
Auction closed.

2452
02:03:49,760 --> 02:03:51,180
Hello, success.

2453
02:03:51,180 --> 02:03:53,200
But there's also a more basic truth here.

2454
02:03:53,200 --> 02:03:57,240
Star Wars is obviously political, and it always was, long before the Prague sunk their hooks

2455
02:03:57,240 --> 02:03:58,240
into it.

2456
02:03:58,240 --> 02:04:01,880
The Star Wars story is about civil war, rebellion against the state, religious persecution,

2457
02:04:01,880 --> 02:04:05,260
persecution of people with immutable traits, economics and the effects of taxation, how

2458
02:04:05,260 --> 02:04:09,180
populism and dismantling bureaucracy can lead to a totalitarian nightmare state, how good

2459
02:04:09,180 --> 02:04:13,140
people are convinced to endorse such a state, and how a crisis can be used to seize political

2460
02:04:13,140 --> 02:04:16,160
power under the guise of temporary emergency measures.

2461
02:04:16,160 --> 02:04:19,640
There is this tendency, exemplified by the you made it political quartering meme, to

2462
02:04:19,640 --> 02:04:23,840
view what is culturally normal as apolitical and what is abnormal as political.

2463
02:04:23,840 --> 02:04:25,700
And some people really take this to the extreme.

2464
02:04:25,700 --> 02:04:29,760
You know, I'm not sure if your average black guy just existing as a political statement,

2465
02:04:29,760 --> 02:04:30,760
my man.

2466
02:04:30,800 --> 02:04:34,640
It's also a Gramscian idea that the dominant culture isn't actually neutral, it's simply

2467
02:04:34,640 --> 02:04:39,080
been normalized, and that a socialist centered culture, once it's normalized, would also

2468
02:04:39,080 --> 02:04:41,000
appear to be neutral to those living within it.

2469
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:42,240
And you know, that's probably true.

2470
02:04:42,240 --> 02:04:46,440
The left's point of view is, when someone says you made it political, what they're actually

2471
02:04:46,440 --> 02:04:49,080
saying is, you made it a type of politics that I don't like.

2472
02:04:49,080 --> 02:04:50,080
And you know what?

2473
02:04:50,080 --> 02:04:51,080
They're correct.

2474
02:04:51,080 --> 02:04:52,080
This is absolutely the case.

2475
02:04:52,080 --> 02:04:54,120
But that's not necessarily a bad thing.

2476
02:04:54,120 --> 02:04:57,600
If you live in a liberal culture, and you value liberalism, and you see a story, like

2477
02:04:57,600 --> 02:05:01,960
say, Star Wars, about a rebellion striving for liberty against an oppressive totalitarian

2478
02:05:01,960 --> 02:05:03,920
empire, that is a liberal story.

2479
02:05:03,920 --> 02:05:05,720
On the surface level, it will appear to be apolitical.

2480
02:05:05,720 --> 02:05:09,240
A quick examination, though, will reveal it to be absolutely political.

2481
02:05:09,240 --> 02:05:13,800
The true complaint here is the subversion of liberal politics is turning Star Wars into

2482
02:05:13,800 --> 02:05:15,240
an anti-liberal story.

2483
02:05:15,240 --> 02:05:16,240
And you know what?

2484
02:05:16,240 --> 02:05:17,520
That's a legitimate complaint, at least to me.

2485
02:05:17,520 --> 02:05:22,800
I have no allegiance to the anti-liberal point of view, but I do object to them taking liberal-aligned

2486
02:05:22,800 --> 02:05:27,400
media and subverting it, even though, when they do, their ethics almost always collapse

2487
02:05:27,400 --> 02:05:28,400
in on themselves.

2488
02:05:28,400 --> 02:05:29,560
Here, let me give you an example.

2489
02:05:29,560 --> 02:05:32,600
One of the best moments in the Obi-Wan show, arguably, was Frak.

2490
02:05:32,600 --> 02:05:34,240
It's pretty clear that Frak's a good guy.

2491
02:05:34,240 --> 02:05:37,400
He likes the stability that the empire's institutions bring to his life.

2492
02:05:37,400 --> 02:05:40,080
His banter with the stormtroopers serves to humanize them both.

2493
02:05:40,080 --> 02:05:43,280
Despite the empire being that totalitarian nightmare state, your average person is just

2494
02:05:43,280 --> 02:05:46,240
doing their job in a system they can't control, and they're just trying to get on with their

2495
02:05:46,240 --> 02:05:48,120
lives and do what they think is the right thing.

2496
02:05:48,120 --> 02:05:53,280
To them, the empire represents security, order, law, trade, jobs, and a bulwark against the

2497
02:05:53,280 --> 02:05:54,740
religious zealotry of the Jedi.

2498
02:05:54,740 --> 02:05:56,840
This dude on Twitter almost gets it.

2499
02:05:56,840 --> 02:05:59,880
This moment was the most real and scary Star Wars has been in a long time.

2500
02:05:59,880 --> 02:06:00,880
Yeah, that's the point.

2501
02:06:00,880 --> 02:06:02,880
Obi-Wan is a wanted man undercover.

2502
02:06:02,880 --> 02:06:05,160
The symbol of the empire should serve to frighten him.

2503
02:06:05,160 --> 02:06:08,400
But the next part of the scene, where Frak and the stormtroopers are humanized, shows

2504
02:06:08,400 --> 02:06:09,400
us the point.

2505
02:06:09,400 --> 02:06:11,360
In a different world, these guys would be friends.

2506
02:06:11,360 --> 02:06:12,440
But then they blow it.

2507
02:06:12,440 --> 02:06:16,920
That's like having a Let's Go Brandon or a Don't Tread On Me bumper sticker on a pickup.

2508
02:06:16,920 --> 02:06:18,760
I mean, just surface level here.

2509
02:06:18,760 --> 02:06:22,920
Despite some of the problems with libertarianism, the libertarian creed of Don't Tread On Me

2510
02:06:22,920 --> 02:06:25,480
is still the exact opposite of the empire's ethics.

2511
02:06:25,480 --> 02:06:27,320
But there's a bigger issue here.

2512
02:06:27,320 --> 02:06:31,520
These people are explicitly ignoring the point of the scene, which is humanizing Obi-Wan's

2513
02:06:31,520 --> 02:06:33,040
enemies before he has to kill them.

2514
02:06:33,040 --> 02:06:36,840
Because they don't accept the idea that their own political opponents should ever

2515
02:06:36,840 --> 02:06:37,840
be humanized.

2516
02:06:37,840 --> 02:06:41,000
I know we're digging back into history now, but remember when Ben Shapiro hosted Mean

2517
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:42,500
Review on PewDiePie's channel?

2518
02:06:42,500 --> 02:06:44,800
Or Donald Trump went on Jimmy Kimmel's show?

2519
02:06:44,800 --> 02:06:48,080
Progressives were screaming bloody murder that these right-leaning people were being

2520
02:06:48,080 --> 02:06:51,140
humanized as if they were not already humans.

2521
02:06:51,140 --> 02:06:55,040
The Prague's rejection of the humanizing moment of this scene shows that they don't

2522
02:06:55,080 --> 02:06:57,520
actually understand the larger Star Wars conflict.

2523
02:06:57,520 --> 02:07:02,060
In their evaluation, there's no moral content here, only the symbols of good and evil.

2524
02:07:02,060 --> 02:07:06,320
If Freck was flying a Pride Month variant of the empire flag off the truck and the narrator

2525
02:07:06,320 --> 02:07:10,200
called the rebellion transphobes or something while Darth Vader was going around choking

2526
02:07:10,200 --> 02:07:14,160
out right-wingers, these idiots would do a complete 180 on this shit.

2527
02:07:14,160 --> 02:07:16,520
They don't want a society free of totalitarianism.

2528
02:07:16,520 --> 02:07:21,360
They want their ideology to be the one enforced by the totalitarian government.

2529
02:07:21,360 --> 02:07:23,360
In fact, okay, Star Wars is political.

2530
02:07:23,360 --> 02:07:24,360
I'm on board.

2531
02:07:24,680 --> 02:07:26,960
What kind of political is Star Wars?

2532
02:07:26,960 --> 02:07:29,840
That question is best answered by going back to the source.

2533
02:07:29,840 --> 02:07:31,800
This line in A New Hope always bothered me.

2534
02:07:31,800 --> 02:07:32,800
It just isn't fair.

2535
02:07:32,800 --> 02:07:33,800
Oh, Biggs is right.

2536
02:07:33,800 --> 02:07:36,760
I'm never going to get out of here.

2537
02:07:36,760 --> 02:07:40,920
So most people know that the Biggs that Luke is referencing is this guy who gets blown

2538
02:07:40,920 --> 02:07:42,500
up during the attack on the Death Star.

2539
02:07:42,500 --> 02:07:45,560
In the original release of the movie, he appears to be just another rebel pilot.

2540
02:07:45,560 --> 02:07:50,200
But in the 1997 special edition, George Lucas added back in a deleted scene showing Luke

2541
02:07:50,200 --> 02:07:53,400
and Biggs reuniting before the battle, where they appear to be old friends who haven't

2542
02:07:53,440 --> 02:07:54,440
seen each other in a while.

2543
02:07:54,440 --> 02:07:55,440
Hey, Luke!

2544
02:07:55,440 --> 02:07:56,440
Biggs!

2545
02:07:56,440 --> 02:07:57,440
I don't believe it!

2546
02:07:57,440 --> 02:07:58,440
Hey!

2547
02:07:58,440 --> 02:07:59,440
How are you?

2548
02:07:59,440 --> 02:08:00,440
Great!

2549
02:08:00,440 --> 02:08:01,440
How'd you get here?

2550
02:08:01,440 --> 02:08:02,440
Hey, you coming up last?

2551
02:08:02,440 --> 02:08:03,440
I'll be right up there with you.

2552
02:08:03,440 --> 02:08:04,440
And have I got stories to tell you?

2553
02:08:04,440 --> 02:08:07,440
You sure you can handle this shit?

2554
02:08:07,440 --> 02:08:10,440
Sir, Luke is the best pushed pilot in the Outer Rim Territories.

2555
02:08:10,440 --> 02:08:12,440
You'll do all right.

2556
02:08:12,440 --> 02:08:13,440
Thank you, sir.

2557
02:08:13,440 --> 02:08:14,440
I'll try.

2558
02:08:14,440 --> 02:08:15,440
I gotta get aboard.

2559
02:08:15,440 --> 02:08:17,440
We'll hear all your stories when we get back, all right?

2560
02:08:17,440 --> 02:08:18,440
All right.

2561
02:08:18,440 --> 02:08:20,440
Hey, Biggs, I told you I'd make it someday.

2562
02:08:20,440 --> 02:08:22,440
It'll be like old times, Luke.

2563
02:08:22,480 --> 02:08:23,480
They'll never stop us.

2564
02:08:24,480 --> 02:08:29,480
Now, the 1997 release was the one that I saw when I was a kid, but even back then, it felt

2565
02:08:29,480 --> 02:08:32,480
like there was some missing setup for Biggs.

2566
02:08:32,480 --> 02:08:33,480
And there was.

2567
02:08:33,480 --> 02:08:37,480
There's a long deleted scene that takes place at Toshi Station, where Luke and his

2568
02:08:37,480 --> 02:08:41,480
group of friends, including Biggs, use binoculars to watch the fight between the Star Destroyer

2569
02:08:41,480 --> 02:08:43,480
and the Counselorship at the beginning of the movie.

2570
02:08:43,480 --> 02:08:47,480
Afterward, Luke has a pretty interesting conversation with Biggs about the trajectory of both of

2571
02:08:47,480 --> 02:08:48,480
their lives.

2572
02:08:48,520 --> 02:08:50,520
I was so close, I thought I was going to fly in my instruments.

2573
02:08:50,520 --> 02:08:52,520
Otherwise, I busted up the Skyhopper pretty bad.

2574
02:08:52,520 --> 02:08:53,520
And I'm all in?

2575
02:08:53,520 --> 02:08:54,520
Furious.

2576
02:08:54,520 --> 02:08:56,520
He wound up grounding me for the rest of the season.

2577
02:08:56,520 --> 02:08:57,520
You should have been there.

2578
02:08:57,520 --> 02:08:58,520
It was fantastic.

2579
02:08:58,520 --> 02:09:00,520
You ought to take it a little easy, Luke.

2580
02:09:00,520 --> 02:09:05,520
You may be the hottest bush pilot this side of Mars Isley, but those little Skyhoppers

2581
02:09:05,520 --> 02:09:06,520
are dangerous.

2582
02:09:06,520 --> 02:09:07,520
Keep it up.

2583
02:09:07,520 --> 02:09:11,520
One day, Whammo, you're going to end up a dark spot on the downside of a canyon wall.

2584
02:09:11,520 --> 02:09:12,520
Look who's talking.

2585
02:09:12,520 --> 02:09:15,520
You've been hanging around the Starfleet so long, you've been sounding like my uncle.

2586
02:09:15,520 --> 02:09:17,520
You know, you're getting a little soft in the city.

2587
02:09:17,560 --> 02:09:21,560
I've missed you, kid.

2588
02:09:21,560 --> 02:09:25,560
Yeah, well, things haven't been the same without you, Biggs.

2589
02:09:25,560 --> 02:09:27,560
It's been so quiet.

2590
02:09:27,560 --> 02:09:32,560
Luke, I didn't come back just to say goodbye.

2591
02:09:32,560 --> 02:09:36,560
I shouldn't tell you this, but you're the only one I can trust.

2592
02:09:36,560 --> 02:09:40,560
See, I may never come back, and I just want someone to know.

2593
02:09:40,560 --> 02:09:43,560
What are you talking about?

2594
02:09:43,600 --> 02:09:46,600
I made some friends at the Academy.

2595
02:09:46,600 --> 02:09:50,600
When our frigate leaves for one of the central systems, we're going to jump ship and join

2596
02:09:50,600 --> 02:09:51,600
the Alliance.

2597
02:09:51,600 --> 02:09:52,600
The Rebellion?

2598
02:09:52,600 --> 02:09:53,600
Quiet down.

2599
02:09:53,600 --> 02:09:54,600
You've got a mouth bigger than a meteor.

2600
02:09:54,600 --> 02:09:55,600
I'm quiet.

2601
02:09:55,600 --> 02:09:56,600
I'm quiet.

2602
02:09:56,600 --> 02:09:57,600
Listen to how quiet I am.

2603
02:09:57,600 --> 02:09:59,600
You can barely hear me.

2604
02:10:01,600 --> 02:10:05,600
My friend has a friend on Bestine who might help us make contact.

2605
02:10:05,600 --> 02:10:06,600
You're crazy.

2606
02:10:06,600 --> 02:10:08,600
You wander around forever trying to find them.

2607
02:10:08,600 --> 02:10:12,600
I know it's a long shot, but if I don't find them, I'll do what I can on my own.

2608
02:10:12,640 --> 02:10:14,640
It's what we always talked about, Luke.

2609
02:10:14,640 --> 02:10:17,640
I'm not going to wait around for the Empire to draft me into service.

2610
02:10:17,640 --> 02:10:21,640
The Rebellion is spreading, and I want to be on the side I believe in.

2611
02:10:21,640 --> 02:10:23,640
Yeah, meanwhile, I'm stuck here.

2612
02:10:23,640 --> 02:10:25,640
You'll get your chance to get off this rock.

2613
02:10:25,640 --> 02:10:27,640
You're going to the Academy next term, aren't you?

2614
02:10:27,640 --> 02:10:28,640
Not likely.

2615
02:10:28,640 --> 02:10:30,640
I had to cancel my application.

2616
02:10:30,640 --> 02:10:31,640
What for?

2617
02:10:31,640 --> 02:10:32,640
My uncle needs me.

2618
02:10:32,640 --> 02:10:33,640
Oh.

2619
02:10:33,640 --> 02:10:34,640
No, I'm serious.

2620
02:10:34,640 --> 02:10:35,640
The Sand People have been getting really crazy.

2621
02:10:35,640 --> 02:10:37,640
They've even raided the outskirts of Anchor Hunt.

2622
02:10:37,640 --> 02:10:38,640
Come on, Luke.

2623
02:10:38,640 --> 02:10:41,640
Your uncle could hold off a whole colony of Sand People with one blaster.

2624
02:10:41,680 --> 02:10:42,680
I know.

2625
02:10:42,680 --> 02:10:45,680
But we've got almost enough evaporators to make the place pay off.

2626
02:10:45,680 --> 02:10:47,680
I have to stay one more season.

2627
02:10:47,680 --> 02:10:48,680
I can't leave him now.

2628
02:10:48,680 --> 02:10:51,680
What good's all your uncle's work if the Empire takes it over?

2629
02:10:51,680 --> 02:10:55,680
You know they've already started to nationalize commerce in the central systems?

2630
02:10:55,680 --> 02:10:58,680
It won't be long before your uncle's just a tenant,

2631
02:10:58,680 --> 02:11:00,680
slaving for the greater glory of the Empire.

2632
02:11:00,680 --> 02:11:02,680
No, that's not going to happen here.

2633
02:11:02,680 --> 02:11:04,680
You said yourself the Empire won't even mess with this old rock.

2634
02:11:04,680 --> 02:11:05,680
Things can change.

2635
02:11:06,680 --> 02:11:07,680
I wish I was going.

2636
02:11:07,680 --> 02:11:09,680
Are you going to be around long?

2637
02:11:09,680 --> 02:11:10,680
No.

2638
02:11:10,720 --> 02:11:11,720
Leaving in the morning.

2639
02:11:12,720 --> 02:11:14,720
I guess I won't see you.

2640
02:11:14,720 --> 02:11:15,720
Maybe someday.

2641
02:11:17,720 --> 02:11:18,720
I'll keep a look at it.

2642
02:11:18,720 --> 02:11:19,720
Yeah.

2643
02:11:19,720 --> 02:11:22,720
I'll be at the Academy next season, and then who knows?

2644
02:11:22,720 --> 02:11:25,720
I won't be drafted into the Imperial Starfleet, that's for sure.

2645
02:11:26,720 --> 02:11:28,720
Well, take it easy, buddy.

2646
02:11:28,720 --> 02:11:30,720
You'll always be the best friend I've ever had.

2647
02:11:30,720 --> 02:11:32,720
So long, Luke.

2648
02:11:40,720 --> 02:11:48,720
Alright, weird ass-pad aside, there's two notable things about this scene.

2649
02:11:48,720 --> 02:11:52,720
First is that to understand Biggs' role in Luke's life, you kind of need this scene.

2650
02:11:52,720 --> 02:11:56,720
Luke's later frustration at Biggs' words now makes a lot more sense.

2651
02:11:56,720 --> 02:12:00,720
Luke's reunion with him at the end of the movie actually carries some weight,

2652
02:12:00,720 --> 02:12:02,720
and Biggs' death actually means something.

2653
02:12:02,720 --> 02:12:07,720
I'm guessing these scenes were left out because George Lucas wanted to tightly follow R2-D2 in C-3PO

2654
02:12:07,720 --> 02:12:09,720
until they joined up with Luke and Obi-Wan.

2655
02:12:09,760 --> 02:12:15,760
The first cut of the film had the intercuts of Luke on the planet with what was going on in space,

2656
02:12:15,760 --> 02:12:18,760
but it just wasn't the movie I wanted to make.

2657
02:12:18,760 --> 02:12:23,760
I wanted to make it about this kind of odd couple and tell the story from their point of view.

2658
02:12:23,760 --> 02:12:26,760
But man, working them in somehow would have improved the movie quite a bit.

2659
02:12:26,760 --> 02:12:29,760
But secondly, there's also the political component of Biggs' speech.

2660
02:12:29,760 --> 02:12:32,760
Biggs states that the Empire has been nationalizing businesses,

2661
02:12:32,760 --> 02:12:36,760
and that the former owners of those businesses become tenants of the Empire.

2662
02:12:36,800 --> 02:12:41,800
His dialogue crafts a link between the idea of nationalization and the idea of landlordship,

2663
02:12:41,800 --> 02:12:44,800
where being a renter is the same as being a government employee,

2664
02:12:44,800 --> 02:12:48,800
and the thing that links them is the lack of personal ownership.

2665
02:12:48,800 --> 02:12:51,800
Biggs also makes it sound like it's at least somewhat common

2666
02:12:51,800 --> 02:12:54,800
for young people to join the Imperial Academy to get training,

2667
02:12:54,800 --> 02:12:56,800
and then defect the Rebellion when they get a chance.

2668
02:12:56,800 --> 02:12:59,800
Now, the Empire is obviously supposed to be a stand-in for Nazi Germany.

2669
02:12:59,800 --> 02:13:02,800
The historical stormtroopers, from which the Imperial stormtroopers get their name,

2670
02:13:02,840 --> 02:13:06,840
were the Brownshirts, the Nazi Party's paramilitary wing in its early years.

2671
02:13:06,840 --> 02:13:11,840
Demographically, the Brownshirts were overwhelmingly young working-class communist-aligned men

2672
02:13:11,840 --> 02:13:14,840
who believed that national socialism could be an alternate path forward

2673
02:13:14,840 --> 02:13:17,840
for the socialist movement instead of the communist international.

2674
02:13:17,840 --> 02:13:22,840
Nowadays, the idea that fascism is capitalism in decay is one that the left clings to,

2675
02:13:22,840 --> 02:13:24,840
despite it being resoundingly false.

2676
02:13:24,840 --> 02:13:27,840
A fascist totalitarian government rolling in, pointing guns at you,

2677
02:13:27,840 --> 02:13:30,840
and telling you that you work for them now, that's not capitalism.

2678
02:13:30,840 --> 02:13:31,840
In fact, that's the opposite of it.

2679
02:13:31,880 --> 02:13:35,880
But back in 1977, when A New Hope came out, World War II wasn't so old,

2680
02:13:35,880 --> 02:13:38,880
and academia hadn't yet been completely subverted,

2681
02:13:38,880 --> 02:13:41,880
such that multiple generations of people no longer understood how politics worked.

2682
02:13:41,880 --> 02:13:45,880
People back then knew that fascism was socialism in decay,

2683
02:13:45,880 --> 02:13:47,880
even if they didn't use that language to say it.

2684
02:13:47,880 --> 02:13:50,880
And this knowledge was reflected in the political undertones of the pop culture of the time.

2685
02:13:50,880 --> 02:13:52,880
Here, let me use another example.

2686
02:13:52,880 --> 02:13:54,880
I don't commonly get into Archie comics on this channel.

2687
02:13:54,880 --> 02:13:58,880
He's not so popular now, but he was a pretty big deal in the early post-war period.

2688
02:13:58,920 --> 02:14:02,920
There's a story that was printed first in 1972 called Mark My Words,

2689
02:14:02,920 --> 02:14:05,920
where Archie has a brand new set of markers that are stolen from him,

2690
02:14:05,920 --> 02:14:07,920
and then graffiti is drawn all over the school with the markers.

2691
02:14:07,920 --> 02:14:10,920
This was back in 72, remember? Markers were invented in 1953.

2692
02:14:10,920 --> 02:14:13,920
Getting a hold of them was easy enough, but they were considered specialized tools,

2693
02:14:13,920 --> 02:14:16,920
not something that everyone would have just lying around their house like today.

2694
02:14:16,920 --> 02:14:19,920
So, Principal Weatherby naturally blames Archie for the graffiti,

2695
02:14:19,920 --> 02:14:23,920
and then in response, the other students casually declare Weatherby a fascist.

2696
02:14:23,920 --> 02:14:26,920
They then say that the downtrodden rising up

2697
02:14:26,960 --> 02:14:29,960
would require the student body to make more and worse graffiti.

2698
02:14:29,960 --> 02:14:32,960
Archie stops them and says that even if he didn't do it,

2699
02:14:32,960 --> 02:14:34,960
suspecting him isn't unreasonable given the evidence,

2700
02:14:34,960 --> 02:14:36,960
and if they really wanted to help fix the situation,

2701
02:14:36,960 --> 02:14:38,960
they should help him clean the mess.

2702
02:14:38,960 --> 02:14:42,960
And it's this show of virtue that convinces the principal that Archie is actually innocent.

2703
02:14:42,960 --> 02:14:46,960
Now, I'm not here telling you to get your serious political analysis from Archie comics,

2704
02:14:46,960 --> 02:14:49,960
nor am I saying that this comic presents the true fascism or whatever.

2705
02:14:49,960 --> 02:14:52,960
What I am saying is, when I first read this comic,

2706
02:14:52,960 --> 02:14:54,960
I was surprised at the use of the term.

2707
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:59,000
In today's pop media, it's so often the case that if fascism is brought up,

2708
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:02,000
it's done to point fingers at the right, even the libertarian right.

2709
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:04,000
But here, that's clearly not the context.

2710
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:08,000
Here, it's done to point fingers at legitimate authority that has made a mistake.

2711
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:10,000
And their prescription for fixing the situation

2712
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:13,000
is to actually do the thing they were mistaken for doing.

2713
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:15,000
The ethic this story is exemplifying for the reader

2714
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:17,000
is that even in the face of injustice,

2715
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:20,000
the best thing you can do is act virtuous.

2716
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:24,000
The people who wrongly call Weatherby a fascist aren't rewarded for doing so.

2717
02:15:24,040 --> 02:15:26,040
They're vilified for exacerbating the situation.

2718
02:15:26,040 --> 02:15:30,040
In a more general sense, there was a broad understanding by people of this era

2719
02:15:30,040 --> 02:15:33,040
that socialism and fascism were feuding brothers,

2720
02:15:33,040 --> 02:15:36,040
and that each of their reactions to the other made society worse.

2721
02:15:36,040 --> 02:15:39,040
While it was liberal democracy standing apart from the two

2722
02:15:39,040 --> 02:15:41,040
from a totally different political school of thought

2723
02:15:41,040 --> 02:15:44,040
that truly had an alternative, more constructive path forward.

2724
02:15:44,040 --> 02:15:48,040
And this can also be seen in the political science writing of this era as well.

2725
02:15:48,040 --> 02:15:50,040
Before the Soviets had begun infiltrating Western universities

2726
02:15:50,040 --> 02:15:52,040
with their active measures program,

2727
02:15:52,080 --> 02:15:54,080
you had papers like, for example,

2728
02:15:54,080 --> 02:15:57,080
A Premature Fascist, Sorelle and Mussolini by James Meisel,

2729
02:15:57,080 --> 02:15:59,080
which documents the clear ideological progression

2730
02:15:59,080 --> 02:16:02,080
from the socialism of French syndicalist George Sorelle

2731
02:16:02,080 --> 02:16:05,080
to the neo-socialism and later fascism of Benito Mussolini.

2732
02:16:05,080 --> 02:16:08,080
With this knowledge, let's return to the cut scenes from Star Wars and New Hope.

2733
02:16:08,080 --> 02:16:12,080
Biggs' assertion that nationalization leads to everyone becoming tenants

2734
02:16:12,080 --> 02:16:14,080
where nobody truly owns their own means of production

2735
02:16:14,080 --> 02:16:16,080
in an exclusive individualistic manner

2736
02:16:16,080 --> 02:16:18,080
and the collective dictates to the individual

2737
02:16:18,080 --> 02:16:20,080
what is the greater good for the people.

2738
02:16:20,120 --> 02:16:23,120
That principle is the handshake between socialism and fascism.

2739
02:16:23,120 --> 02:16:26,120
Meanwhile, in the Wild West environment that is Tatooine,

2740
02:16:26,120 --> 02:16:28,120
with all of its many problems,

2741
02:16:28,120 --> 02:16:31,120
there's still ultimately more freedom there than within the empire.

2742
02:16:31,120 --> 02:16:34,120
The small landowners and businessmen who exclusively own property,

2743
02:16:34,120 --> 02:16:37,120
they're less well-off materially than the citizens of the core worlds,

2744
02:16:37,120 --> 02:16:39,120
but they're free, at least for now,

2745
02:16:39,120 --> 02:16:40,120
and they want to keep it that way.

2746
02:16:40,120 --> 02:16:43,120
The rebellion is a liberal individualistic uprising

2747
02:16:43,120 --> 02:16:45,120
against a socialist system in decay

2748
02:16:45,120 --> 02:16:47,120
and George Lucas wrote that story

2749
02:16:47,120 --> 02:16:49,120
within the context of a larger cultural backdrop

2750
02:16:49,160 --> 02:16:51,160
that still understood the natural progression

2751
02:16:51,160 --> 02:16:53,160
between a socialist revolution and a fascist state.

2752
02:16:53,160 --> 02:16:56,160
Now, maybe you might say that deleted scenes don't count.

2753
02:16:56,160 --> 02:16:58,160
They don't really represent what Star Wars is all about

2754
02:16:58,160 --> 02:17:00,160
because they were, you know, deleted.

2755
02:17:00,160 --> 02:17:03,160
And so, not only their plot points but their underlying morals

2756
02:17:03,160 --> 02:17:05,160
should be disregarded.

2757
02:17:05,160 --> 02:17:08,160
The problem is, Biggs' speech slots in quite well

2758
02:17:08,160 --> 02:17:10,160
to what we know about the empire's economy,

2759
02:17:10,160 --> 02:17:13,160
as told on screen in The Empire Strikes Back.

2760
02:17:13,160 --> 02:17:15,160
So you see, since we're a small operation,

2761
02:17:15,160 --> 02:17:18,160
we don't fall into the jurisdiction of the empire.

2762
02:17:18,200 --> 02:17:20,200
So you're part of the mining guild then?

2763
02:17:20,200 --> 02:17:21,200
No, not actually.

2764
02:17:21,200 --> 02:17:23,200
Our operation is small enough not to be noticed.

2765
02:17:23,200 --> 02:17:26,200
Fascist political theory describes what they called

2766
02:17:26,200 --> 02:17:27,200
a corporative economy,

2767
02:17:27,200 --> 02:17:30,200
where guild-like bodies, called corporations,

2768
02:17:30,200 --> 02:17:33,200
would bring together the managers of government-led business

2769
02:17:33,200 --> 02:17:35,200
and representatives from nationalized unions

2770
02:17:35,200 --> 02:17:38,200
to determine how best to implement state policy.

2771
02:17:38,200 --> 02:17:40,200
In this scene, Lando is expressing gratitude

2772
02:17:40,200 --> 02:17:43,200
that his business is small enough not to be nationalized

2773
02:17:43,200 --> 02:17:45,200
in the way that Biggs described

2774
02:17:45,200 --> 02:17:47,200
under the jurisdiction of the mining guild.

2775
02:17:47,240 --> 02:17:48,240
And later in the movie,

2776
02:17:48,240 --> 02:17:51,240
the empire does actually roll in and take over the business

2777
02:17:51,240 --> 02:17:54,240
because Han and Leia's presence shines a spotlight on them,

2778
02:17:54,240 --> 02:17:55,240
just like how, in reality,

2779
02:17:55,240 --> 02:17:58,240
fascists would march into businesses, point guns at them,

2780
02:17:58,240 --> 02:17:59,240
and tell them that they work for the state now.

2781
02:17:59,240 --> 02:18:02,240
Again, this is not capitalism in decay.

2782
02:18:02,240 --> 02:18:03,240
It is, in fact, state socialism.

2783
02:18:03,240 --> 02:18:06,240
That idea is disproven on the very first page

2784
02:18:06,240 --> 02:18:08,240
of the book Hitler's Beneficiaries

2785
02:18:08,240 --> 02:18:10,240
by German historian Goetz Ali.

2786
02:18:10,240 --> 02:18:12,240
Ali describes the efforts of Stuart Elliot Eisenstadt,

2787
02:18:12,240 --> 02:18:14,240
an American who has spent much of his life

2788
02:18:14,240 --> 02:18:16,240
negotiating reparations for victims of the Holocaust.

2789
02:18:16,280 --> 02:18:18,280
In fact, he's been the federal government special advisor

2790
02:18:18,280 --> 02:18:21,280
on Holocaust issues under Obama, Trump, and Biden.

2791
02:18:21,280 --> 02:18:24,280
Part of Eisenstadt's work involved securing compensation

2792
02:18:24,280 --> 02:18:26,280
from private German businesses

2793
02:18:26,280 --> 02:18:28,280
that profited off of Nazi slave labor.

2794
02:18:28,280 --> 02:18:29,280
And Ali immediately agrees

2795
02:18:29,280 --> 02:18:32,280
that Eisenstadt was fully in the right to pursue damages.

2796
02:18:32,280 --> 02:18:33,280
But despite this,

2797
02:18:33,280 --> 02:18:36,280
Eisenstadt's highly public negotiations with these companies,

2798
02:18:36,280 --> 02:18:39,280
widely publicized in the media in the 1990s and early 2000s,

2799
02:18:39,280 --> 02:18:41,280
led to a distorted view

2800
02:18:41,280 --> 02:18:44,280
of just how complicit German captains of industry were

2801
02:18:44,280 --> 02:18:45,280
in the horrors of the Nazi regime.

2802
02:18:45,320 --> 02:18:47,320
The Nazis had no problem pointing their guns

2803
02:18:47,320 --> 02:18:49,320
and making demands of private owners of business

2804
02:18:49,320 --> 02:18:50,320
if it meant getting what they want,

2805
02:18:50,320 --> 02:18:53,320
a fact that first came out during the Nuremberg Trials.

2806
02:18:53,320 --> 02:18:56,320
And while German industry is responsible for what it did,

2807
02:18:56,320 --> 02:18:58,320
it's also important to recognize

2808
02:18:58,320 --> 02:19:00,320
how little of a choice the individuals involved had.

2809
02:19:00,320 --> 02:19:03,320
But that nuance doesn't work very well as a headline.

2810
02:19:03,320 --> 02:19:05,320
And even back then, headlines are all that people read.

2811
02:19:05,320 --> 02:19:07,320
But none of this context would be alien

2812
02:19:07,320 --> 02:19:09,320
to Star Wars viewers of the 1970s or 80s

2813
02:19:09,320 --> 02:19:13,320
who didn't exist within a wider culture of leftist academics,

2814
02:19:13,360 --> 02:19:15,360
successfully subverting the knowledge

2815
02:19:15,360 --> 02:19:17,360
of what fascism actually is,

2816
02:19:17,360 --> 02:19:19,360
and replacing it with that false notion

2817
02:19:19,360 --> 02:19:21,360
that fascism is capitalism in decay.

2818
02:19:21,360 --> 02:19:24,360
So, the idea that fascism is capitalism in decay

2819
02:19:24,360 --> 02:19:27,360
was ultimately spread by neo-Marxist academics,

2820
02:19:27,360 --> 02:19:29,360
following the cultural theory of Antonio Gramsci,

2821
02:19:29,360 --> 02:19:32,360
who successfully dismantled our previous cultural understanding

2822
02:19:32,360 --> 02:19:35,360
of the links between socialism and fascism

2823
02:19:35,360 --> 02:19:38,360
as a part of a multi-decade project of Soviet subversion.

2824
02:19:38,360 --> 02:19:40,360
They then replaced that previous knowledge

2825
02:19:40,360 --> 02:19:41,360
with a new theory

2826
02:19:41,400 --> 02:19:43,400
that corporations are themselves fascist,

2827
02:19:43,400 --> 02:19:46,400
relying on the modern definition of the word corporation

2828
02:19:46,400 --> 02:19:49,400
and ignoring the very different definition from the 1920s

2829
02:19:49,400 --> 02:19:51,400
when Mussolini was actually writing about the corporative state

2830
02:19:51,400 --> 02:19:53,400
as part of fascist political theory,

2831
02:19:53,400 --> 02:19:55,400
and then backed up their new construction

2832
02:19:55,400 --> 02:19:57,400
by misinterpreting Eisenstadt's good work.

2833
02:19:57,400 --> 02:20:00,400
Now then, because Star Wars is political,

2834
02:20:00,400 --> 02:20:02,400
we can go back to the original movies

2835
02:20:02,400 --> 02:20:04,400
where the broad cultural understanding

2836
02:20:04,400 --> 02:20:06,400
of the true nature of socialism is still intact

2837
02:20:06,400 --> 02:20:08,400
and see that understanding shine through in the narrative.

2838
02:20:08,400 --> 02:20:10,400
Afterward, we can go to the newest movies

2839
02:20:10,440 --> 02:20:12,440
witness the end result of progressive subversion

2840
02:20:12,440 --> 02:20:15,440
and notice how all the ethics, all the morals, all the heroism

2841
02:20:15,440 --> 02:20:17,440
has been entirely flipped on its head

2842
02:20:17,440 --> 02:20:19,440
and how that roughly corresponds

2843
02:20:19,440 --> 02:20:21,440
with the loss of broader political knowledge

2844
02:20:21,440 --> 02:20:23,440
regarding socialism's true nature.

2845
02:20:23,440 --> 02:20:25,440
But, if a progressive were to hear that analysis

2846
02:20:25,440 --> 02:20:27,440
about how Star Wars is political,

2847
02:20:27,440 --> 02:20:29,440
I would be labeled a racist, bigoted, boot-licking chud

2848
02:20:29,440 --> 02:20:31,440
who is too stupid to understand politics

2849
02:20:31,440 --> 02:20:33,440
and I'm taking Star Wars too seriously and...

2850
02:20:33,440 --> 02:20:35,440
Don't ask questions, just consume product

2851
02:20:35,440 --> 02:20:37,440
and then get excited for next product.

2852
02:20:37,440 --> 02:20:39,440
Yeah, that.

2853
02:20:39,440 --> 02:20:41,440
The honest truth is, everything can be political

2854
02:20:41,440 --> 02:20:43,440
Prague's are right about that

2855
02:20:43,440 --> 02:20:45,440
but it's an active choice to politicize something.

2856
02:20:45,440 --> 02:20:47,440
All of these political interpretations of Star Wars

2857
02:20:47,440 --> 02:20:49,440
they're all valid

2858
02:20:49,440 --> 02:20:51,440
but you can also just shut your brain off

2859
02:20:51,440 --> 02:20:53,440
and watch the movie if you like.

2860
02:20:53,440 --> 02:20:55,440
And that's just as valid a choice

2861
02:20:55,440 --> 02:20:57,440
because its purpose is entertainment, not cultural change

2862
02:20:57,440 --> 02:20:59,440
no matter what a gramtiate might tell you.

2863
02:20:59,440 --> 02:21:01,440
Let's say, for example, there was a Star Wars club

2864
02:21:01,440 --> 02:21:03,440
at your university or something.

2865
02:21:03,440 --> 02:21:05,440
I don't know what you kids do nowadays.

2866
02:21:05,440 --> 02:21:07,440
And let's say that there was a club rule to keep politics at the door.

2867
02:21:07,440 --> 02:21:09,440
And let's say some whining Prague

2868
02:21:09,440 --> 02:21:11,440
said this rule was unfair because Star Wars is political.

2869
02:21:11,440 --> 02:21:13,440
The correct response is to say

2870
02:21:13,440 --> 02:21:15,440
maybe so, but this space isn't.

2871
02:21:15,440 --> 02:21:17,440
Political neutrality cannot simply be assumed anymore.

2872
02:21:17,440 --> 02:21:19,440
There's too many subversives in the West right now.

2873
02:21:19,440 --> 02:21:21,440
It has to be actively enforced

2874
02:21:21,440 --> 02:21:23,440
as a moral good in its own right.

2875
02:21:23,440 --> 02:21:25,440
And the reason it is a good

2876
02:21:25,440 --> 02:21:27,440
is because a neutral space is the only place

2877
02:21:27,440 --> 02:21:29,440
where ideas can truly be explored

2878
02:21:29,440 --> 02:21:31,440
where new things can truly be invented.

2879
02:21:31,440 --> 02:21:33,440
In a world where every space is a socialist space

2880
02:21:33,440 --> 02:21:35,440
it wouldn't be possible to explore ideas

2881
02:21:35,440 --> 02:21:37,440
beyond socialism.

2882
02:21:37,440 --> 02:21:39,440
Which is, by the way, the point of what they're doing.

2883
02:21:39,440 --> 02:21:41,440
Building the cultural hegemony that I've been talking about

2884
02:21:41,440 --> 02:21:43,440
for the past half hour.

2885
02:21:43,440 --> 02:21:45,440
If you want to know what that process looks like

2886
02:21:45,440 --> 02:21:47,440
all you have to do is look around.

2887
02:21:47,440 --> 02:21:49,440
The subversion of Star Wars

2888
02:21:49,440 --> 02:21:51,440
the loss of old political knowledge

2889
02:21:51,440 --> 02:21:53,440
for the sake of the Left's expediency

2890
02:21:53,440 --> 02:21:55,440
that's only one symptom among many.

2891
02:21:55,440 --> 02:21:57,440
The bland, grey, lifeless, algorithmic sludge

2892
02:21:57,440 --> 02:21:59,440
is the product of that cultural hegemony.

2893
02:21:59,440 --> 02:22:01,440
Where because everyone's views are enshrined

2894
02:22:01,440 --> 02:22:03,440
no prescriptions can be made.

2895
02:22:03,440 --> 02:22:05,440
Nobody can get offended.

2896
02:22:05,440 --> 02:22:07,440
And there is only a facsimile of emotional impact.

2897
02:22:07,440 --> 02:22:09,440
With this understanding, let's look at the wider culture.

2898
02:22:09,440 --> 02:22:11,440
Here's an advertisement from a theatre back in the day.

2899
02:22:11,440 --> 02:22:13,440
Compare that to this schedule from an AMC in Times Square

2900
02:22:13,440 --> 02:22:15,440
showing 70 different screenings of Doctor Strange.

2901
02:22:15,440 --> 02:22:17,440
The Contemporary Music Super Study

2902
02:22:17,440 --> 02:22:19,440
has shown that overall

2903
02:22:19,440 --> 02:22:21,440
the number one song since 2017

2904
02:22:21,440 --> 02:22:23,440
has been Ed Sheeran's Shape of You

2905
02:22:23,440 --> 02:22:25,440
every single year for the past five years.

2906
02:22:25,440 --> 02:22:27,440
It's funny, but that song is generic as fuck.

2907
02:22:27,440 --> 02:22:29,440
UMG, Warner, and Sony

2908
02:22:29,440 --> 02:22:31,440
control the content on Spotify.

2909
02:22:31,440 --> 02:22:33,440
Every alt, counterculture, rebellious song

2910
02:22:33,440 --> 02:22:35,440
about smashing the system or raging against the machine

2911
02:22:35,440 --> 02:22:37,440
is now owned by a hedge fund.

2912
02:22:37,440 --> 02:22:39,440
The consolidation of news media

2913
02:22:39,440 --> 02:22:41,440
is continuing at a breakneck pace.

2914
02:22:41,440 --> 02:22:43,440
The biggest upcoming films are simply rehashes

2915
02:22:43,440 --> 02:22:45,440
of big films from the past

2916
02:22:45,440 --> 02:22:47,440
and elite awards for creativity

2917
02:22:47,440 --> 02:22:49,440
are dominated by these rehashes.

2918
02:22:49,440 --> 02:22:51,440
In online streaming, niche options are gradually pruned away

2919
02:22:51,440 --> 02:22:53,440
and suggestions push people towards the mainstream

2920
02:22:53,440 --> 02:22:55,440
including platforms like Netflix

2921
02:22:55,440 --> 02:22:57,440
and user-generated platforms like YouTube.

2922
02:22:57,440 --> 02:22:59,440
In book publishing, five companies control the market.

2923
02:22:59,440 --> 02:23:01,440
In all creative industries

2924
02:23:01,440 --> 02:23:03,440
the banal word of content

2925
02:23:03,440 --> 02:23:05,440
is used to describe every single type of creative work

2926
02:23:05,440 --> 02:23:07,440
with the implication that artistry

2927
02:23:07,440 --> 02:23:09,440
is generic and interchangeable.

2928
02:23:09,440 --> 02:23:11,440
It's no longer books and movies and TV shows and video games

2929
02:23:11,440 --> 02:23:13,440
and YouTube videos. It's all just content

2930
02:23:13,440 --> 02:23:15,440
something for you to consume.

2931
02:23:15,440 --> 02:23:17,440
Leftoids may look at this wider state of cultural affairs

2932
02:23:17,440 --> 02:23:19,440
and claim this is the natural end stage of capitalism

2933
02:23:19,440 --> 02:23:21,440
monopolies consolidating and corporate power

2934
02:23:21,440 --> 02:23:23,440
and making profit to the point of destroying the market.

2935
02:23:23,440 --> 02:23:25,440
And fair enough, that's probably part of it.

2936
02:23:25,440 --> 02:23:27,440
But the issue is, this is the Left's capitalism.

2937
02:23:27,440 --> 02:23:29,440
The thematic elements of all of this content

2938
02:23:29,440 --> 02:23:31,440
as I have gone to great pains to show in this video

2939
02:23:31,440 --> 02:23:33,440
is radically pro-left

2940
02:23:33,440 --> 02:23:35,440
pro-progressive, anti-capitalist

2941
02:23:35,440 --> 02:23:37,440
anti-cop, pro-revolution

2942
02:23:37,440 --> 02:23:39,440
academia is also radically pro-left

2943
02:23:39,440 --> 02:23:41,440
and out of that environment comes cultural studies

2944
02:23:41,440 --> 02:23:43,440
where the well-educated

2945
02:23:43,440 --> 02:23:45,440
left-leaning ivory tower elitist

2946
02:23:45,440 --> 02:23:47,440
is given the job of properly interpreting culture

2947
02:23:47,440 --> 02:23:49,440
so that the masses may consume it

2948
02:23:49,440 --> 02:23:51,440
in the correct progressive approved way

2949
02:23:51,440 --> 02:23:53,440
in much the same way that back in the day

2950
02:23:53,440 --> 02:23:55,440
only priests knew Latin and could read the Bible

2951
02:23:55,440 --> 02:23:57,440
while commoners simply had to listen to them.

2952
02:23:57,440 --> 02:23:59,440
Despite the claim that the Left's ethics

2953
02:23:59,440 --> 02:24:01,440
is centered on supporting the working class against the bourgeoisie

2954
02:24:01,440 --> 02:24:03,440
the Left's elitism shows that

2955
02:24:03,440 --> 02:24:05,440
they desire to be the bourgeoisie

2956
02:24:05,440 --> 02:24:07,440
that indoctrinates the working class

2957
02:24:07,440 --> 02:24:09,440
in the correct way of doing politics.

2958
02:24:09,440 --> 02:24:11,440
The Left's cultural victory as well as their continued

2959
02:24:11,440 --> 02:24:13,440
insistence that they are still the counter-culture

2960
02:24:13,440 --> 02:24:15,440
has created a very strange monoculture

2961
02:24:15,440 --> 02:24:17,440
where there is no real alt-culture

2962
02:24:17,440 --> 02:24:19,440
where action and reaction have been

2963
02:24:19,440 --> 02:24:21,440
synthesized into one amalgamation

2964
02:24:21,440 --> 02:24:23,440
where the cultural hegemony has expanded across everything

2965
02:24:23,440 --> 02:24:25,440
and become a totalizing ideology

2966
02:24:25,440 --> 02:24:27,440
the creative world feels bankrupt

2967
02:24:27,440 --> 02:24:29,440
there's a sense of sameness in everything

2968
02:24:29,440 --> 02:24:31,440
nobody can be offended so nothing can be interesting

2969
02:24:31,440 --> 02:24:33,440
and this perpetual limitation is rewarded

2970
02:24:33,440 --> 02:24:35,440
while some alternative voices might exist

2971
02:24:35,440 --> 02:24:37,440
they never truly break through anymore

2972
02:24:37,440 --> 02:24:39,440
their cultural impact is zero

2973
02:24:39,440 --> 02:24:41,440
we now exist under an overarching

2974
02:24:41,440 --> 02:24:43,440
totalitarian cultural hegemony

2975
02:24:43,440 --> 02:24:45,440
that actively pushes progressive politics

2976
02:24:45,440 --> 02:24:47,440
into every possible space

2977
02:24:47,440 --> 02:24:49,440
because neutral ground is viewed as simply

2978
02:24:49,440 --> 02:24:51,440
another opportunity to create the next

2979
02:24:51,440 --> 02:24:53,440
generation of young revolutionaries

2980
02:24:53,440 --> 02:24:55,440
it is for this reason that Progs treat

2981
02:24:55,440 --> 02:24:57,440
centrists or politically disengaged people

2982
02:24:57,440 --> 02:24:59,440
the same way they treat those who actively

2983
02:24:59,440 --> 02:25:01,440
hold different politics than they do

2984
02:25:01,440 --> 02:25:03,440
and Star Wars, having been stripped of all of its meaning

2985
02:25:03,440 --> 02:25:05,440
now only exists as a tool

2986
02:25:05,440 --> 02:25:07,440
of this process.

2987
02:25:07,440 --> 02:25:09,440
You know, I think this might be the end of

2988
02:25:09,440 --> 02:25:11,440
Star Wars for me.

2989
02:25:11,440 --> 02:25:13,440
Now that I've finally done this video

2990
02:25:13,440 --> 02:25:15,440
I've got four hours of recorded content for this video

2991
02:25:15,440 --> 02:25:17,440
I know it'll be trimmed down in post

2992
02:25:17,440 --> 02:25:19,440
but I've been here a while. But now that I'm done

2993
02:25:19,440 --> 02:25:21,440
I think I've said everything that I want

2994
02:25:21,440 --> 02:25:23,440
to say about Star Wars. It feels like

2995
02:25:23,440 --> 02:25:25,440
this is my goodbye. I really liked the original trilogy

2996
02:25:25,440 --> 02:25:27,440
as a kid, and I was young enough to not be able to see

2997
02:25:27,440 --> 02:25:29,440
the glaring flaws of the prequels. It was just

2998
02:25:29,440 --> 02:25:31,440
fun to be along for the ride, you know? I didn't understand

2999
02:25:31,440 --> 02:25:33,440
that Star Wars was, at its heart, a morality

3000
02:25:33,440 --> 02:25:35,440
play, but that's okay. We absorb ethics

3001
02:25:35,440 --> 02:25:37,440
even if we don't recognize them, and that's what

3002
02:25:37,440 --> 02:25:39,440
subversives are hoping for. I was hopeful

3003
02:25:39,440 --> 02:25:41,440
yet worried with The Force Awakens. I was

3004
02:25:41,440 --> 02:25:43,440
flexed and disgusted with The Last Jedi, and I was

3005
02:25:43,440 --> 02:25:45,440
resigned with The Rise of Skywalker. The first season

3006
02:25:45,440 --> 02:25:47,440
of The Mandalorian was legitimately good, but then

3007
02:25:47,440 --> 02:25:49,440
Disney desperately hitched like ten fucking

3008
02:25:49,440 --> 02:25:51,440
properties to the second season and ruined it.

3009
02:25:51,440 --> 02:25:53,440
And at this point, with Kenobi, my

3010
02:25:53,440 --> 02:25:55,440
grieving process is over. The soul

3011
02:25:55,440 --> 02:25:57,440
of Star Wars is gone, replaced by an

3012
02:25:57,440 --> 02:25:59,440
algorithm. I'll probably still watch some stuff

3013
02:25:59,440 --> 02:26:01,440
if only to make fun of it with my friends. I'll pirate

3014
02:26:01,440 --> 02:26:03,440
it, of course. But Star Wars is no

3015
02:26:03,440 --> 02:26:05,440
longer the once-in-a-generation cultural phenomenon

3016
02:26:05,440 --> 02:26:07,440
that it once was. At least not to me.

3017
02:26:07,440 --> 02:26:09,440
And it's because of what Disney has done to it.

3018
02:26:09,440 --> 02:26:11,440
They've stripped out what made Star Wars

3019
02:26:11,440 --> 02:26:13,440
Star Wars, and replaced it with progressive activism.

3020
02:26:13,440 --> 02:26:15,440
And I'm just not here for that. I'm getting older.

3021
02:26:15,440 --> 02:26:17,440
My time on this planet is running out. All of

3022
02:26:17,440 --> 02:26:19,440
ours is. And I just don't want to

3023
02:26:19,440 --> 02:26:21,440
waste my limited attention caring about

3024
02:26:21,440 --> 02:26:23,440
a thing that they clearly don't care about

3025
02:26:23,440 --> 02:26:25,440
themselves.

3026
02:26:39,440 --> 02:26:41,440
If you look at my channel's release schedule,

3027
02:26:41,440 --> 02:26:43,440
you should probably notice that I put out a video

3028
02:26:43,440 --> 02:26:45,440
or I did a stream or something for every day

3029
02:26:45,440 --> 02:26:47,440
in July. I committed myself to once a day

3030
02:26:47,440 --> 02:26:49,440
on SFO for a month, and I did it.

3031
02:26:49,440 --> 02:26:51,440
Even if a couple videos were jokey ones, like my

3032
02:26:51,440 --> 02:26:53,440
editor's a communist or whatever. There was still

3033
02:26:53,440 --> 02:26:55,440
one piece of SFO content every day.

3034
02:26:55,440 --> 02:26:57,440
But even while I was doing that, I was still spending

3035
02:26:57,440 --> 02:26:59,440
like an hour a day working on the Kenobi review.

3036
02:26:59,440 --> 02:27:01,440
As the end of July approached, I only had

3037
02:27:01,440 --> 02:27:03,440
like half the script written. And I realized if I didn't

3038
02:27:03,440 --> 02:27:05,440
knuckle down and devote some real time to this video,

3039
02:27:05,440 --> 02:27:07,440
it was just never going to come out. At least,

3040
02:27:07,440 --> 02:27:09,440
not in any timely way. So you

3041
02:27:09,440 --> 02:27:11,440
should also notice that my release schedule in August

3042
02:27:11,440 --> 02:27:13,440
has been absolutely nothing at all.

3043
02:27:13,440 --> 02:27:15,440
TUBCASTS and Weekly Sips came out, but

3044
02:27:15,440 --> 02:27:17,440
beyond that, I've been pretty much radio silence.

3045
02:27:17,440 --> 02:27:19,440
On Discord, on Twitter, everywhere.

3046
02:27:19,440 --> 02:27:21,440
I've done almost nothing but work on

3047
02:27:21,440 --> 02:27:23,440
Kenobi this whole time. Wake up, work,

3048
02:27:23,440 --> 02:27:25,440
eat, sleep. For nearly two weeks

3049
02:27:25,440 --> 02:27:27,440
now. We're talking like 12

3050
02:27:27,440 --> 02:27:29,440
to 16 hour days. And as I worked,

3051
02:27:29,440 --> 02:27:31,440
I realized this had to be about Star Wars, not

3052
02:27:31,440 --> 02:27:33,440
just Kenobi. I couldn't say what I wanted to say

3053
02:27:33,440 --> 02:27:35,440
using only Kenobi. It had to be broader than that.

3054
02:27:35,440 --> 02:27:37,440
Which is why the video opens up in the second half.

3055
02:27:37,440 --> 02:27:39,440
It was actually pretty grueling doing something

3056
02:27:39,440 --> 02:27:41,440
this big, I'm not going to lie. I don't think I'm going to

3057
02:27:41,440 --> 02:27:43,440
attempt anything quite so in-depth

3058
02:27:43,440 --> 02:27:45,440
again. Not without a sponsor for the video

3059
02:27:45,440 --> 02:27:47,440
or I have the money to hire support staff or

3060
02:27:47,440 --> 02:27:49,440
something. I enjoy doing it. I don't regret

3061
02:27:49,440 --> 02:27:51,440
doing it. But I do feel like it's taken a little bit out of

3062
02:27:51,440 --> 02:27:53,440
me. Also, I highly doubt that Disney's going to let

3063
02:27:53,440 --> 02:27:55,440
me keep a cent of this. So if you want to support the channel,

3064
02:27:55,440 --> 02:27:57,440
please consider my Patreon, my SubscribeStar,

3065
02:27:57,440 --> 02:27:59,440
my Twitch sub button, or the YouTube membership button.

3066
02:27:59,440 --> 02:28:01,440
Every little bit helps and I greatly appreciate the support.

3067
02:28:01,440 --> 02:28:03,440
I'm going to take a short SFO vacation

3068
02:28:03,440 --> 02:28:05,440
now that this is out. I will return to the daily video

3069
02:28:05,440 --> 02:28:07,440
grind on Monday, but I think I'm just going to relax with

3070
02:28:07,440 --> 02:28:09,440
some video streams for the next few days.

3071
02:28:09,440 --> 02:28:11,440
And yeah, I'll do the Minecraft server too now that I'm

3072
02:28:11,440 --> 02:28:13,440
finally free from the editing dungeon. But yes,

3073
02:28:13,440 --> 02:28:15,440
this was the fabled Kenobi review.

3074
02:28:15,440 --> 02:28:17,440
I hope you enjoyed it, because if you didn't, I just tortured

3075
02:28:17,440 --> 02:28:19,440
myself for weeks over nothing.

3076
02:28:19,440 --> 02:28:21,440
I'll see you guys next time.

3077
02:28:21,440 --> 02:28:23,440
I love you.
