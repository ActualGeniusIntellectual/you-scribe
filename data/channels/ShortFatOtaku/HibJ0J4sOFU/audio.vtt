WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:29.960
Hey, we're back in the movie studio.

00:29.960 --> 00:34.040
This time to talk about the newest Star Wars property, well, slightly newest.

00:34.040 --> 00:36.200
The Obi-Wan Kenobi show has been done for about a month.

00:36.200 --> 00:40.560
I figure that's enough time for the fanboys to stop soying out over it and start soying

00:40.560 --> 00:42.880
out over Star Wars andor instead.

00:42.880 --> 00:45.520
These shows seem to have a particular life cycle.

00:45.520 --> 00:49.680
When the name is quietly printed at one of those corporate meetings, fans begin to rapidly

00:49.680 --> 00:57.040
speculate.

00:57.040 --> 01:00.320
Once the trailer drops, everyone uploads their reaction video where they're screaming and

01:00.320 --> 01:02.560
crying and clapping and talking about how they've done it again.

01:02.560 --> 01:07.200
Oh my god, it's a cultural phenomenon.

01:07.200 --> 01:11.160
Then as the movie or the show or whatever actually premieres, everyone gets into a competition

01:11.160 --> 01:15.760
on social media to see who can give Disney the deepest, most full-throated blowey they

01:15.760 --> 01:16.760
can.

01:16.760 --> 01:20.640
And then a month later, everyone finally comes to their senses and realizes, yeah, that was

01:20.640 --> 01:21.640
kind of shit, wasn't it?

01:21.640 --> 01:25.700
I've got a lot to say about the Obi-Wan Kenobi show, so it goes without saying that I'm going

01:25.700 --> 01:27.340
to spoil pretty much everything.

01:27.340 --> 01:32.140
Therefore, if for some ungodly reason you plan to watch this series yourself, you may

01:32.140 --> 01:33.860
want to step away from this video.

01:33.860 --> 01:37.460
Also, I'm very aware that multiple channels have already gone over the show in depth,

01:37.460 --> 01:40.640
including Red Letter Media, EFAP, and It's a Gundam, and I'll try not to say the same

01:40.640 --> 01:43.940
things that they do, but you know how this reviewing stuff goes sometimes.

01:43.940 --> 01:48.100
Don't worry though, at the very least, I won't be autistically analyzing the different eras

01:48.100 --> 01:51.700
of Darth Vader's suit to find inconsistencies in the costume.

01:51.700 --> 01:53.820
Geez, Gundam, that was a bit too much even for me.

01:53.820 --> 01:56.460
Oh, Vader does look like a cosplayer this time around.

01:56.460 --> 02:01.140
Additionally, even though this video is an in-depth review of the Obi-Wan Kenobi show,

02:01.140 --> 02:05.500
it's also a wider discussion of Star Wars as a whole, including at the end a political

02:05.500 --> 02:06.500
discussion.

02:06.500 --> 02:07.700
If you're not here for that, that's fine with me.

02:07.700 --> 02:11.780
The Kenobi review ends and the meta conversation begins at about the halfway mark.

02:11.780 --> 02:20.500
But enough goofing around, let's get this show on the road.

02:20.500 --> 02:23.780
The first episode of Obi-Wan Kenobi begins with the supercut of the original trilogy,

02:23.780 --> 02:26.880
and I gotta say, they cut the shit out of these movies.

02:26.880 --> 02:30.380
Just to let you really young Zoomers know, the internet did actually exist 20 years ago

02:30.380 --> 02:34.540
when the prequel trilogy came out, and forum posts and later YouTube videos of the day

02:34.540 --> 02:37.540
considered these three movies to be dogshit.

02:37.540 --> 02:41.620
That's all it takes for Cypher to give up his whole life in service to some evil mastermind.

02:41.620 --> 02:45.820
Honestly, is Cypher the most easily manipulated little worm on the planet or what?

02:45.820 --> 02:50.320
Who's going to believe that a hero, young and reckless though he may be, is simply going

02:50.320 --> 02:55.520
to abandon his entire life and his career in a prestigious, respected order of warrior

02:55.520 --> 03:00.080
knights just because some evil wizard challenges his feelings of powerlessness and impotence

03:00.080 --> 03:03.640
and offers him the chance that power and respect he feels he's been denied.

03:03.640 --> 03:05.280
You're not all powerful.

03:05.280 --> 03:07.120
Well, I should be.

03:07.120 --> 03:10.240
I will be the most powerful Jedi ever.

03:10.240 --> 03:15.520
But at the very least, people are nostalgic for them, despite or perhaps because of their

03:15.520 --> 03:16.520
flaws.

03:16.520 --> 03:19.720
I think that's why the meme of shitting on the prequels versus the sequels caught

03:19.720 --> 03:20.720
on for a while.

03:20.720 --> 03:22.880
People know the prequels are bad, but they love them anyway.

03:22.880 --> 03:23.880
They can take a joke.

03:23.880 --> 03:28.660
Anyway, despite these being three shitty movies, this supercut makes them look amazing.

03:28.660 --> 03:29.660
The music's great.

03:29.660 --> 03:32.080
They show Anakin's life and his relationship with Obi-Wan.

03:32.080 --> 03:33.080
It's justâ€¦

03:33.080 --> 03:34.080
Mwah.

03:34.080 --> 03:37.680
It was watching this when I realized that I think I love the idea of Star Wars more

03:37.680 --> 03:39.920
than the execution of Star Wars at this point.

03:39.920 --> 03:44.160
There's this rich universe full of lore and characters and organizations and conflicts

03:44.160 --> 03:47.680
and all this history, and then we get shit like this.

03:47.680 --> 03:55.960
The first actual scene of the Obi-Wan show has some Jedi younglings practicing Tai Chi

03:55.960 --> 03:56.960
or something.

03:56.960 --> 04:01.680
It looks all nice and serene and then suddenly Order 66 happens and the shaky cam begins.

04:01.680 --> 04:02.680
Watch it.

04:02.680 --> 04:03.680
This is laughable.

04:03.680 --> 04:06.160
It looks like the cameraman was pulling back and then tripped over an apple box or something.

04:06.160 --> 04:10.400
We get to witness Jedi fighting clone troopers during that historic moment, setting up Riva

04:10.400 --> 04:11.400
in the process.

04:11.640 --> 04:15.640
Yes, I am pretty sure that everybody and their mother knew that this was Riva on their first

04:15.640 --> 04:16.640
viewing.

04:16.640 --> 04:18.120
It's not exactly hard to figure out what they're doing here.

04:18.120 --> 04:22.600
There's no reason to remake the Order 66 scene when you've already flashed back to

04:22.600 --> 04:25.960
the original footage, unless you're going to add some new information.

04:25.960 --> 04:29.400
We cut to the present day, which is ten years later, approximately halfway between Revenge

04:29.400 --> 04:30.640
of the Sith and A New Hope.

04:30.640 --> 04:34.560
The setting is Tatooine, specifically a reuse of the Tatooine set from The Mandalorian and

04:34.560 --> 04:35.560
Boba Fett.

04:35.560 --> 04:36.560
Hey, if you've got it, why not?

04:36.560 --> 04:40.900
The Inquisitors have come to town, an elite group of Force-sensitives that hunt Jedi on

04:40.900 --> 04:41.900
behalf of the Empire.

04:41.900 --> 04:44.620
Oh, come on, dude, why'd you have to park in the middle of the road?

04:44.620 --> 04:46.420
We've got a spaceport, you know.

04:46.420 --> 04:50.580
The Grand Inquisitor, along with Umbrella Hat Man, are both characters from Star Wars

04:50.580 --> 04:53.660
Rebels, with established personalities and story arcs.

04:53.660 --> 04:57.620
Fun fact, the Grand Inquisitor in that show was played by Jason Isaacs, the guy who did

04:57.620 --> 05:02.360
both Draco's dad in Harry Potter and Captain Lorca in Star Trek Discovery, the only legitimately

05:02.360 --> 05:04.260
interesting thing about that show's first season.

05:04.260 --> 05:07.940
Upon learning that his character was heading towards the live-action screen, Jason Isaacs

05:07.940 --> 05:09.820
expressed interest in playing him there, too.

05:09.860 --> 05:11.580
But alas, we got this guy instead.

05:11.580 --> 05:15.060
I'm sorry, I don't know him for anything, but his filmography isn't nearly as extensive

05:15.060 --> 05:18.540
or high-profile, and I am wondering if it was a budget issue, considering Kenobi feels

05:18.540 --> 05:19.900
kind of cheap all around.

05:19.900 --> 05:23.300
It turns out that Kenobi only had a $90 million budget.

05:23.300 --> 05:27.540
That's actually not that much in comparison to the $100 million for a season of The Mandalorian

05:27.540 --> 05:33.120
or Boba Fett, or the $150 million that Moon Knight and Ms. Marvel, or the non-Disney offerings

05:33.120 --> 05:36.820
of Star Trek Picard and Star Trek Strange New Worlds all commanded.

05:36.820 --> 05:40.460
I think that's why, despite the aesthetically impressive offerings of the slum planet of

05:40.460 --> 05:45.820
Dayu and the underwater fortress Inquisitorius, overall the Kenobi show feels rather drab.

05:45.820 --> 05:49.540
The other locations are the beige rocks of Tatooine, the red rocks of Jabiim, the brown

05:49.540 --> 05:53.780
rocks of the nameless planet that only exists to duel on, and the black rocks of a quarry

05:53.780 --> 05:54.780
in California.

05:54.780 --> 05:58.700
Multiple ships use the same cockpit set, just recolored, in an attempt to make it look like

05:58.700 --> 05:59.700
it's a new place.

05:59.700 --> 06:03.560
A lack of money is the only explanation I can think of as to why the show can make some

06:03.560 --> 06:06.700
things look so good and other things look so cheap.

06:06.700 --> 06:14.740
The thing that we really aspire to constantly is quality.

06:14.740 --> 06:18.420
Maybe they couldn't afford to take on another big name beyond Owen McGregor, and it sucks

06:18.420 --> 06:22.420
too because Jason Isaacs is great, and, more importantly, he's got the correct shaped

06:22.420 --> 06:23.420
head.

06:23.420 --> 06:27.160
No, really, the Grand Inquisitor is supposed to be a member of the Pau'an race, yeah these

06:27.160 --> 06:28.160
guys from episode 3.

06:28.160 --> 06:31.660
With the long skinny bald heads, these effects were made with a combination of prosthetics

06:31.660 --> 06:33.780
with a little bit of CG to add a few extra touches.

06:33.780 --> 06:36.280
But I guess they just didn't have the budget for all that in Kenobi.

06:36.860 --> 06:38.160
It would have looked a little bit better on Isaacs, though.

06:38.160 --> 06:41.960
They're also missing the full suite of cranial ridges, no no no I'm not going to go full

06:41.960 --> 06:43.200
autist like Gundam did.

06:43.200 --> 06:47.360
This scene serves to set up the Inquisitors, what they do, the Jedi in their current situation,

06:47.360 --> 06:49.620
and the conflict between Riva and the Grand Inquisitor.

06:49.620 --> 06:52.140
But it does it just so poorly.

06:52.140 --> 06:53.600
Why is the dialogue so stilted?

06:53.600 --> 06:55.320
We should be hunting bigger prey.

06:55.320 --> 07:00.640
He is not yours to find, we are past this third sister, I will not warn you again.

07:00.640 --> 07:05.520
You will forget this fixation with Kenobi or I will relieve you of your duties, is that

07:05.520 --> 07:06.520
clear?

07:06.520 --> 07:09.480
Why do you just grimace menacingly at the Jedi and not stop him?

07:09.480 --> 07:13.360
Why does a fallen tarp stop the chase, literally just go the fuck around it?

07:13.360 --> 07:15.240
The catching up with Obi-Wan stuff has done pretty well.

07:15.240 --> 07:18.680
There's a lot of good character moments here, and they do a good job of showing, not

07:18.680 --> 07:19.680
telling.

07:19.680 --> 07:23.320
The drudgery of Obi-Wan's daily job, butchering a rotting sand whale, especially compared

07:23.320 --> 07:24.960
to the prestige of his previous life.

07:24.960 --> 07:28.520
How he appears powerless and oppressed whenever injustice happens.

07:28.520 --> 07:32.240
How he isolates himself in a cave and has flashbacks to the pre-cultural events in his

07:32.240 --> 07:34.040
dreams, even events he wasn't even present for.

07:34.080 --> 07:36.840
I guess we didn't need that pre-show recap after all.

07:36.840 --> 07:41.000
During those lonely nights Obi-Wan spends time with his anteater face, hahaha don't

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
look that one up.

07:42.000 --> 07:45.740
But in all seriousness this is a depressed Obi-Wan, and we spend like half the episode

07:45.740 --> 07:46.740
setting it up.

07:46.740 --> 07:49.600
This is legitimately good stuff, even if the writing is kinda shitty.

07:49.600 --> 07:51.360
You have no idea what I've been through.

07:51.360 --> 07:53.320
Uh, I might have an idea dude.

07:53.320 --> 07:57.120
We also set up the conflict between Obi-Wan and Uncle Owen, something that is only lightly

07:57.120 --> 07:58.120
touched on in A New Hope.

07:58.120 --> 08:00.300
I wonder if he's related to Ben.

08:00.300 --> 08:02.020
That wizard's just a crazy old man.

08:02.020 --> 08:05.620
This is a natural plotline though, that Obi-Wan would be buzzing around like a weird stalker,

08:05.620 --> 08:07.980
while Owen just wants to get on with his life and bury the past.

08:07.980 --> 08:10.300
It's pretty easy to feel for both of these characters.

08:10.300 --> 08:12.580
Owen truly does want what's best for Luke.

08:12.580 --> 08:15.420
Meanwhile Obi-Wan's clearly having PTSD just looking at the kid.

08:15.420 --> 08:33.500
Nonetheless, these two are truly quite stupid characters.

08:33.500 --> 08:37.700
They have private conversations about Obi-Wan being a Jedi, Luke being a Jedi, etc. in the

08:37.700 --> 08:44.500
open fucking street.

08:44.500 --> 08:46.460
Can you guys take this shit inside maybe?

08:46.460 --> 08:52.180
Ride Obi-Wan's farting anteater back home?

08:52.180 --> 08:56.180
Seriously this guy says rewards will be given and you're just going to drop a thank you

08:56.180 --> 08:58.680
in the crowd?

08:58.680 --> 09:01.180
You think these people won't sell you out for money?

09:01.180 --> 09:04.860
The show then cuts to Princess Leia Organa, future leader of a very well known asteroid

09:04.860 --> 09:05.860
belt.

09:05.860 --> 09:09.000
They do a lot of work setting her up too, with Bail Organa returning from episode 3.

09:09.000 --> 09:12.120
Her life as a princess, there's a bunch of noble family stuff in there, but it's clear

09:12.120 --> 09:16.280
she wants no part of it, opting to spend her time running away from the palace to hang

09:16.280 --> 09:18.320
out in the woods with her droid, Lola.

09:18.320 --> 09:21.200
Which by the way, was an idea originally from the prequels.

09:21.200 --> 09:25.080
A vision of Padme having a hovering personal droid companion was something that didn't

09:25.080 --> 09:26.740
make it out of the concept stage.

09:26.740 --> 09:30.640
Also at one point she had a falcon too, I wouldn't mind seeing falconer Leia.

09:30.640 --> 09:33.400
At this point I will ask the obvious question.

09:33.400 --> 09:36.760
If you're going to do an Obi-Wan story, and it's not just going to be about his shitty

09:36.760 --> 09:39.440
life in the desert, what do you do?

09:39.440 --> 09:41.320
Do you have him butt heads with Uncle Owen?

09:41.320 --> 09:44.800
I mean of course, that's a natural extension of already established stories.

09:44.800 --> 09:45.800
But what else?

09:45.800 --> 09:47.600
You can't make him go have a huge adventure with Luke.

09:47.600 --> 09:52.100
A new hope firmly establishes that Luke knows of Obi-Wan as Ben Kenobi, but they're not

09:52.100 --> 10:01.160
friends or acquaintances.

10:01.160 --> 10:02.160
So what do you do?

10:02.160 --> 10:03.920
You include a Leia storyline instead I guess.

10:03.920 --> 10:04.920
And you know what?

10:04.920 --> 10:08.600
If you skim over a new hope, you'll realize that Leia and Obi-Wan don't actually share

10:08.600 --> 10:09.640
any scenes together.

10:09.640 --> 10:13.160
While Obi-Wan is spending his time kickstarting Luke's hero's journey, Leia is on the Death

10:13.160 --> 10:14.160
Star.

10:14.160 --> 10:17.640
By the time Luke, Han and Chewie rescue Leia, Obi-Wan has already gone off on his own.

10:17.640 --> 10:19.600
So putting them together now is perfect right?

10:19.600 --> 10:23.440
Well I'm pretty sure that the only thing the people making this show did was skim the

10:23.440 --> 10:24.440
old content.

10:24.440 --> 10:28.200
Because if Leia actually went on this huge epic adventure with Obi-Wan that we see in

10:28.200 --> 10:35.960
the show, she'd probably be reacting just like Luke does when he dies.

10:35.960 --> 10:39.080
Does this look like a woman who's just lost a close friend and mentor?

10:39.080 --> 10:42.880
With whom she bopped around the galaxy a decade earlier during her most formative years?

10:42.880 --> 10:46.040
This is the look of somebody who's like, are you fucking kidding me, did this kid just

10:46.040 --> 10:47.040
blow our cover?

10:47.040 --> 10:52.920
Yeah dude, Leia does not give a fuck that Obi-Wan's dead.

10:52.920 --> 10:57.160
Anyway, we need to kick off this Obi-Wan and Leia adventure that totally happened somehow.

10:57.160 --> 10:58.440
So Leia gets kidnapped.

10:58.440 --> 11:00.960
But not before a tense chase scene through Alderaan's woods.

11:00.960 --> 11:07.180
And by tense I mean cartoonish.

11:07.180 --> 11:10.260
This is the sort of thing that you'd expect to see on a Disney Kids series, where the

11:10.260 --> 11:13.900
adults are somehow slow and incompetent, and the tiny child keeps managing to get away.

11:13.900 --> 11:18.160
In fact, there's like four running scenes with Leia, and they all follow this formula.

11:18.160 --> 11:20.540
Somehow grown ass adults just can't keep up with her.

11:20.540 --> 11:24.680
So Leia's kidnapped, and Bail Organa wants Obi-Wan to come out of hiding at great personal

11:24.680 --> 11:26.500
risk to himself, and sort it out.

11:26.500 --> 11:28.820
For some reason he's not going to ask the Empire for help.

11:28.820 --> 11:32.300
Because remember, at this point in the timeline, Organa is an Imperial Senator for a planet

11:32.300 --> 11:33.300
under the protection of the Empire.

11:33.300 --> 11:37.100
And I know the Empire is evil and all, but it still ultimately values rule of law, and

11:37.100 --> 11:40.900
considers abducting an Imperial Senator's daughter a grave offense, as the Grand Inquisitor

11:40.900 --> 11:45.780
will tell us next episode.

11:45.780 --> 11:48.100
Nor does Bail consider sending out his own personal guard.

11:48.100 --> 11:51.780
Yeah, those guys in the background with funny hats, that get completely shot up and destroyed

11:51.780 --> 11:53.260
in A New Hope and Rogue One.

11:53.260 --> 11:55.900
Alderaan has its own security force, he could send those.

11:55.900 --> 11:59.460
Hell, if for some reason, Organa wanted to keep it a secret, he could call it bounty

11:59.460 --> 12:00.460
hunters.

12:00.460 --> 12:01.620
That's literally their job in this universe.

12:01.620 --> 12:04.180
Hired muscle for when you don't want the authorities finding out.

12:04.180 --> 12:06.220
No, he just wants Obi-Wan.

12:06.220 --> 12:07.220
But here's why.

12:07.220 --> 12:10.700
Only you know how important she really is, Obi-Wan.

12:10.700 --> 12:13.180
Wait a second, how important is she?

12:13.180 --> 12:16.300
I mean, yeah, she's Anakin's daughter, and Luke's son.

12:16.300 --> 12:17.300
That's pretty important.

12:17.300 --> 12:21.520
But only insofar as Anakin's personal feelings, and maybe some sort of succession or legitimacy

12:21.520 --> 12:22.700
thing down the line?

12:22.700 --> 12:26.580
Yes, Bail loves his daughter, but they're acting like she's a child of destiny or something.

12:26.580 --> 12:27.860
My duty is to the boy.

12:27.860 --> 12:31.500
What about your duty to his sister?

12:31.500 --> 12:33.440
She's as important as he is.

12:33.440 --> 12:36.760
There was that whole stupid prophecy thing that George Lucas invented for the prequels

12:36.760 --> 12:41.160
about Anakin bringing balance to the force, but his kids aren't named in the prophecy.

12:41.160 --> 12:44.840
You refer to the prophecy of the one who will bring balance to the force.

12:44.840 --> 12:47.160
Also in the end, Anakin didn't bring balance to the force.

12:47.160 --> 12:53.040
You and the chosen one bring balance to the force, not leave it in darkness.

12:53.040 --> 12:56.040
I know George Lucas later confirmed in an interview that it was Luke who fulfilled the

12:56.040 --> 12:57.440
prophecy in episode 6.

12:57.440 --> 13:02.440
The prophecy is that Anakin will bring balance to the force and destroy the Sith.

13:02.440 --> 13:07.100
He becomes Darth Vader, Darth Vader does become the hero, Darth Vader does destroy

13:07.100 --> 13:10.440
the Sith, meaning himself and the Emperor.

13:10.440 --> 13:13.680
He does it because he is redeemed by his son.

13:13.680 --> 13:17.640
But even that didn't matter because Luke's school fell apart, and by the end of the sequel

13:17.640 --> 13:19.880
trilogy there's no Jedi or Sith anymore or anything.

13:19.880 --> 13:21.080
Is that what balance meant?

13:21.080 --> 13:22.920
I guess everyone's equal when they're dead.

13:22.920 --> 13:27.840
Anyway, my point is, Leia is important politically, as both the Senator's daughter and secretly

13:27.840 --> 13:28.840
Anakin's daughter.

13:28.840 --> 13:30.700
But insofar as Bail Organa knows, that's it.

13:30.740 --> 13:34.500
They're treating her like she's supremely important, and yeah she is to the future movies,

13:34.500 --> 13:35.500
but these guys don't know that.

13:35.500 --> 13:37.460
Are they reading the fucking scripts or something?

13:37.460 --> 13:41.900
They're even treating her as more important than Luke, who actually does become the hero,

13:41.900 --> 13:45.780
and who Obi-Wan is all too happy to abandon his watch over to go on this adventure.

13:45.780 --> 13:48.500
Dude, hide your lightsaber, like what the fuck?

13:48.500 --> 13:51.460
The blue tunic was actually a good look on you, man, Obi-Wan should have stayed in that

13:51.460 --> 13:52.460
the whole adventure.

13:52.460 --> 13:56.100
Why would you dig up the old dirty Jedi robes and then just hang the lightsaber off them

13:56.100 --> 13:57.100
for all to see?

13:57.100 --> 14:00.260
Is that what secretly gives a Jedi his powers, the unwashed robes?

14:00.300 --> 14:03.060
So, Obi-Wan arrives in the Blade Runner planet of Dio.

14:03.060 --> 14:04.060
And you know what?

14:04.060 --> 14:06.220
They did a pretty good job with the art direction here, all things considered.

14:06.220 --> 14:09.500
There's even that nice touch of bringing back Boba Fett's actor to play an aging

14:09.500 --> 14:11.800
clone trooper who's now down on his luck.

14:11.800 --> 14:14.020
You can see Obi-Wan getting flashbacks as soon as he sees him.

14:14.020 --> 14:17.140
I have a feeling that maybe the clone trooper should have recognized Obi-Wan since, you

14:17.140 --> 14:19.420
know, Order 66, but still, this is good stuff.

14:19.420 --> 14:21.220
We're introduced to Haja, who's a scam artist.

14:21.220 --> 14:24.580
He pretends to be a Jedi using tricks in sleight of hand to fleece people, which again, I

14:24.580 --> 14:25.580
don't mind.

14:25.580 --> 14:28.140
That's the kind of person you'd find in a scum bucket city like this.

14:28.140 --> 14:30.300
He is what passes for this story's comic relief.

14:30.300 --> 14:34.980
And, like most comedy written by nihilistic millennials, he's only really got one note.

14:34.980 --> 14:35.980
Being sardonic.

14:35.980 --> 14:37.860
And hey, to his credit, it's sometimes funny.

14:37.860 --> 14:40.160
But for the most part, he overstays his welcome in every scene he's in.

14:40.160 --> 14:44.900
Due to the usual hijinks, Haja ends up leading Obi-Wan to the drug operation the gangsters

14:44.900 --> 14:46.820
who kidnapped Leia are operating out of.

14:46.820 --> 14:50.520
Obi-Wan is taken prisoner, he breaks out, he breaks Leia out, Leia doesn't trust him,

14:50.520 --> 14:53.860
she runs away, he catches up, Leia doesn't trust him again, she runs away again, this

14:53.860 --> 14:57.960
time into a rooftop firefight against a punk rocker from that dinosaur show, and a robot

14:57.960 --> 15:07.560
who is more stiff than Hayden Christensen's acting in Attack of the Clones.

15:07.560 --> 15:12.040
I'm really skimming over this quickly, because every scene is extremely painful and contrived.

15:12.040 --> 15:16.160
Awful dialogue, forced chase scenes, completely counterintuitive character moments.

15:16.160 --> 15:19.800
It feels like a Disney executive said to the writers, this episode needs a rooftop shootout,

15:19.800 --> 15:23.480
a street level chase scene, a drug lab, and a cargo port, because that's what the analytics

15:23.480 --> 15:24.480
say will be good.

15:24.480 --> 15:28.320
Then the writing department padded it out with really bad dialogue and scenes of Alan

15:28.320 --> 15:44.640
McGregor playing with children.

15:44.640 --> 15:47.920
But it's not only the props and the sets and the algorithms that they're writing around,

15:47.920 --> 15:51.560
but also the phenomenon that I mentioned in my Boba Fett video, that I called Cool Scene

15:51.560 --> 15:52.560
Itis.

15:52.560 --> 15:55.720
That final shot of the previous episode, with the lightsaber hanging off Obi-Wan's belt,

15:55.720 --> 15:57.060
that's a perfect example.

15:57.060 --> 16:00.520
Disney wanted that trailer bait shot, something that fanboys would shed tears over in their

16:00.520 --> 16:01.620
reaction videos.

16:01.620 --> 16:05.320
Even though it's literally the dumbest fucking thing, because walking around with a lightsaber

16:05.320 --> 16:08.800
while Inquisitors are hunting Jedi is a fast track to getting your face shoved into the

16:08.800 --> 16:09.800
meat grinder.

16:09.800 --> 16:13.920
But it looks cool, you got the iconic imagery, the swelling orchestra, Obi-Wan's back baby!

16:13.920 --> 16:17.760
They're pursuing these moments at the expense of the cohesiveness of the plot.

16:17.760 --> 16:21.200
At this point in the story it's implied that Obi-Wan's connection to the Force has

16:21.200 --> 16:25.800
withered away along with the rest of him.

16:25.800 --> 16:28.120
Leia's hanging on by a thread and Obi-Wan's in a bind.

16:28.120 --> 16:30.140
Either he uses the Force or she dies.

16:30.140 --> 16:33.880
It's that pressure cooker moment where the hero finally steps up, and of course Obi-Wan

16:33.880 --> 16:34.880
does.

16:34.880 --> 16:37.600
Wait a second though, this isn't the first time Obi-Wan used the Force in the show, is

16:37.600 --> 16:38.600
it?

16:38.600 --> 16:40.880
Earlier in the episode, when Obi-Wan was breaking into the drug compound, he notices

16:40.880 --> 16:43.040
that the door going into the back is locked.

16:43.040 --> 16:47.040
His plan is to cause one of the drug beakers to over boil and explode, causing a commotion,

16:47.040 --> 16:50.920
upon which he pickpockets the key from the guard and slips in while everyone's distracted.

16:50.920 --> 16:54.320
But watch the scene again, he enters from the right and then faces the front wall, where

16:54.320 --> 16:55.320
the camera is.

16:55.320 --> 16:57.040
It's the blue beaker behind him that explodes.

16:57.040 --> 17:00.400
He doesn't adjust any knobs with his hands or anything, not that there are any knobs

17:00.400 --> 17:01.400
where he is.

17:01.400 --> 17:04.360
It's just a shelf of materials and some chemical canisters that aren't hooked up

17:04.360 --> 17:05.360
to anything.

17:05.360 --> 17:08.520
And with his back turned to the beaker, it blows up all on its own, which is when he

17:08.520 --> 17:09.520
slips in.

17:09.520 --> 17:10.520
Am I crazy?

17:10.520 --> 17:13.960
Because this seems like he used the Force to turn a knob over on the burner, or drastically

17:13.960 --> 17:15.400
heat the liquid up or something.

17:15.400 --> 17:18.520
And everyone that I was watching this with took it that way too, we were all confused

17:18.520 --> 17:22.040
like, why are they doing a big Obi-Wan has to use the Force for the first time scene?

17:22.040 --> 17:23.720
Didn't we just see him use it?

17:23.720 --> 17:28.200
Meanwhile, it's revealed that Raeva is the one who hired the thugs to kidnap Leia, specifically

17:28.200 --> 17:31.640
for the purpose of drawing Obi-Wan out, so that she can capture him and make a name for

17:31.640 --> 17:32.640
herself.

17:32.640 --> 17:35.360
The other Inquisitors are outraged because, you know, the Imperial Senator's daughter

17:35.360 --> 17:36.360
thing.

17:36.360 --> 17:38.000
And this is when we get handed this beauty of a scene.

17:38.000 --> 17:41.440
I found a link between him and Organa in the archives.

17:41.440 --> 17:43.000
I used the girl as bait.

17:43.000 --> 17:44.420
You hear that line?

17:44.420 --> 17:47.860
I found a link between him and Organa in the archives.

17:47.860 --> 17:49.980
I used the girl as bait.

17:49.980 --> 17:50.980
That is a redub.

17:50.980 --> 17:52.140
I should know, I do them all the time.

17:52.140 --> 17:54.580
If you've got a sharp enough ear, you've been doing this sort of thing long enough,

17:54.580 --> 17:55.700
it's not hard to spot.

17:55.700 --> 17:58.740
Every time you set up to do voice recording, even if it's the same location, the same

17:58.740 --> 18:02.780
microphone, the same equipment, the same people, it always sounds just slightly different.

18:02.780 --> 18:05.420
Maybe the mic is in just a slightly different position relative to your mouth.

18:05.420 --> 18:06.500
Maybe you're sitting differently.

18:06.500 --> 18:08.460
Maybe the moisture content in the air is a little different.

18:08.460 --> 18:12.160
Whatever the case is, no two recording sessions sound exactly alike.

18:12.160 --> 18:16.260
In fact, this video is so huge, I'm doing two recording sessions on two different days

18:16.260 --> 18:17.260
just to get it all done.

18:17.260 --> 18:19.680
Let me know in the comments if you can tell when day two starts.

18:19.680 --> 18:22.700
So listen to that scene again and really open your ears.

18:22.700 --> 18:26.140
I found a link between him and Organa in the archives.

18:26.140 --> 18:28.020
I used the girl as bait.

18:28.020 --> 18:32.460
They added the line, I found a link between him and Organa in the archives in post, presumably

18:32.460 --> 18:36.740
because they realized after shooting that there is no way anybody should know about

18:36.740 --> 18:38.300
a connection between Obi-Wan and Leia.

18:38.300 --> 18:41.180
Hell, there's no way that anyone should know that Leia's adopted at all.

18:41.180 --> 18:44.020
You know, my father says they never let you leave this planet.

18:44.020 --> 18:51.140
Yeah, I know, Bail's wife probably didn't appear pregnant, but you can fake that shit.

18:51.140 --> 18:52.140
Fake records and pictures?

18:52.140 --> 18:53.140
It's the goddamn future.

18:53.140 --> 18:57.300
If Stalin could airbrush literally everybody out of existence, surely wifey here could

18:57.300 --> 18:59.260
have been given a baby bump in a picture.

18:59.260 --> 19:03.380
Sure, there's no automatic reason to suspect that Bail's publicly adopted daughter is

19:03.380 --> 19:07.660
actually the believed to be dead child of Padme Amidala, but why even leave the door

19:07.660 --> 19:08.660
open?

19:08.660 --> 19:12.340
So what is this connection that Riva dug up from the archives that is so important that

19:12.340 --> 19:14.700
Obi-Wan would come out of hiding to rescue Leia?

19:14.700 --> 19:17.500
Is it that Bail, Organa, and Obi-Wan knew each other back in the day?

19:17.500 --> 19:18.500
That's not really enough.

19:18.500 --> 19:20.740
Bail's a senator and Obi-Wan was a Jedi Master.

19:20.740 --> 19:24.700
There's plenty of reason that both men would know any number of other state officials or

19:24.700 --> 19:26.680
military officials or other important people.

19:26.680 --> 19:28.740
They had a working relationship isn't enough.

19:28.740 --> 19:32.220
Either the archives showed an extremely tenuous circumstantial connection between Obi-Wan

19:32.220 --> 19:36.140
and Bail, and therefore Riva should be executed on the spot by the Grand Inquisitor for taking

19:36.140 --> 19:40.820
such an insane and stupid gambit, or the archives showed a rock solid connection between Bail

19:40.820 --> 19:44.740
and Obi-Wan, and therefore a garrison of stormtroopers should be en route to Alderaan

19:44.740 --> 19:48.760
immediately to extract any Jedi information from the Organa family and then send them

19:48.760 --> 19:51.380
off to concentration camps to be turned into Soylent drinks.

19:51.380 --> 19:55.500
But the show won't commit to either of these possibilities, because the plot simultaneously

19:55.500 --> 19:59.780
demands them both, plausible enough to kinda act on, but not plausible enough to really

19:59.780 --> 20:00.780
act on.

20:00.780 --> 20:02.420
Riva does get punished for this though.

20:02.420 --> 20:05.840
The Grand Inquisitor benches her and takes over the pursuit of Kenobi himself, so she

20:05.840 --> 20:09.980
decides to go do her best Batman impression by hanging out on the rooftops of the city,

20:09.980 --> 20:11.940
hoping for some reason that Obi-Wan will show up there.

20:11.940 --> 20:13.200
And of course, he does.

20:13.200 --> 20:17.340
This leads to a completely meaningless set of scenes where Riva does some very slow,

20:17.340 --> 20:21.140
poorly choreographed Force parkour to try and get to the gunfight in time.

20:21.140 --> 20:22.980
Which she doesn't, so whatever.

20:22.980 --> 20:27.020
Back on the ground, Haja tells Obi-Wan to take an automated cargo transport to bypass

20:27.020 --> 20:28.720
the Empire shutting down all the shuttles.

20:28.720 --> 20:32.620
It's pre-programmed to take them to a safehouse because it turns out he's part of the Rebellion.

20:32.620 --> 20:36.500
It's at this point that I realize that I really, really hate Leia's character.

20:36.500 --> 20:40.860
She's simultaneously the dumb, naive kid and the wise-beyond-her-years Serene Princess

20:40.860 --> 20:44.620
and you can't be both of those things.

20:44.620 --> 20:45.620
Who?

20:45.620 --> 20:46.620
Fucking Jar Jar?

20:46.620 --> 20:50.220
Riva shows up though, so Obi-Wan stays behind to give Leia time to get to safety.

20:50.220 --> 20:52.340
Start a counter on this one kids, it happens a lot.

20:52.340 --> 20:54.060
So Leia runs ahead to the cargo transport.

20:54.060 --> 20:57.700
A transport made only for cargo, not designed for humans to be in it.

20:57.700 --> 20:59.900
Okay, so why are there human-sized doors?

20:59.900 --> 21:01.780
And human chairs for people to sit on?

21:01.780 --> 21:04.460
Also, why can you breathe in the ship when it goes into space?

21:04.460 --> 21:06.300
Ah whatever, we can't worry about that too much.

21:06.300 --> 21:34.320
We have this monumentally stupid fucking scene to watch.

21:34.320 --> 21:50.220
So Obi-Wan knows that Anakin Skywalker is Darth Vader.

21:50.220 --> 21:53.160
Vader does keep his real identity a secret from the wider public.

21:53.160 --> 21:56.320
There's a lot of stories out there where he kills people he used to know or who somehow

21:56.320 --> 21:57.320
found out.

21:57.320 --> 22:01.040
It's kind of the equivalent of Vader wanting his old Anakin Twitter account buried because

22:01.040 --> 22:03.520
there's some edgy shit on there and he lost the password, you know?

22:03.520 --> 22:07.360
But Vader himself isn't a secret, he's the public face of the Empire, that's the

22:07.360 --> 22:08.360
point of the guy.

22:08.360 --> 22:12.480
Darth Vader is the name whispered by the people as a cautionary tale to not fuck with the

22:12.480 --> 22:13.480
Empire.

22:13.480 --> 22:17.120
Are you seriously telling me that after ten fucking years, word never made it back to

22:17.120 --> 22:21.920
Obi-Wan that there's a dude in a pressure sealed burn protective suit named Darth fucking

22:21.920 --> 22:25.120
Vader running around acting as the Empire's front man?

22:25.120 --> 22:27.760
Does the newspaper just not get delivered on Tatooine or what?

22:27.760 --> 22:30.840
Anyway, Riva kills the Grand Inquisitor.

22:30.840 --> 22:33.360
Everyone knew he was coming back because Star Wars Rebels takes place later in the timeline

22:33.360 --> 22:34.360
and he's in that show.

22:34.360 --> 22:38.160
Though, to be honest, some people genuinely believed that Disney would violate their own

22:38.160 --> 22:40.800
new canon just for the hell of it, including me for a little bit.

22:40.800 --> 22:44.100
This did lead to some funny moments of Internet salt, the best of which probably being this

22:44.100 --> 22:45.100
post on Reddit.

22:45.100 --> 22:47.600
I'm so tired of people complaining about stupid shit.

22:47.600 --> 22:49.320
Obviously, the Grand Inquisitor isn't dead.

22:49.320 --> 22:52.080
He's in Rebels and Pow-An have two stomachs.

22:52.080 --> 22:56.020
Oh, is that the reason why he's not dead?

22:56.020 --> 22:57.020
Get stabbed in the stomach.

22:57.020 --> 22:58.020
Oh, it's no problem.

22:58.020 --> 22:59.020
You got another one.

22:59.020 --> 23:01.320
Yeah, if you're with the spine or the aorta or any of their surrounding organs, you got

23:01.320 --> 23:02.320
two stomachs, buddy.

23:02.320 --> 23:03.320
Just use the other one.

23:04.280 --> 23:05.280
It'll be okay.

23:05.280 --> 23:08.840
Obi-Wan manages to escape onto the cargo ship with Riva waving her sword menacingly.

23:08.840 --> 23:10.600
But isn't there a garrison on the planet now?

23:10.600 --> 23:12.520
Surely there's Imperial ships in orbit or something.

23:12.520 --> 23:14.720
All Riva has to do is call it in and they'll stop the transport.

23:14.720 --> 23:17.960
Okay, we know Riva's setting this up as a double-cross invader, so maybe she won't

23:17.960 --> 23:18.960
do it.

23:18.960 --> 23:22.800
But why not Umbrella Hat Man or Reptile Hijab Lady or any of the other soldiers?

23:22.800 --> 23:24.320
Maybe the Grand Inquisitor could do it.

23:24.320 --> 23:26.060
You know, before Vader puts him in the bacta tank?

23:26.060 --> 23:30.200
I have to tell you, before I pass out, my lord, Obi-Wan is on that ship.

23:30.200 --> 23:31.280
And there you go, right as rain.

23:31.280 --> 23:34.440
I know Hijab's explanation is that it's an automated ship, so the Empire will ignore

23:34.440 --> 23:35.440
it.

23:35.440 --> 23:36.440
That's kind of stupid, isn't it?

23:36.440 --> 23:37.440
It's a cargo port.

23:37.440 --> 23:38.440
It's fully automated.

23:38.440 --> 23:39.440
They won't be looking for you there.

23:39.440 --> 23:40.840
Wouldn't they just stop it just to be sure?

23:40.840 --> 23:43.880
Well, they didn't shoot C-3PO and Archer D-2's escape pod either.

23:43.880 --> 23:44.880
Hold your fire.

23:44.880 --> 23:45.880
There's no lifeforms.

23:45.880 --> 23:46.880
They must have short-circuited.

23:46.880 --> 23:51.260
Maybe the Empire really is just fucking dumb when it comes to letting important ships slip

23:51.260 --> 23:53.520
by, because censors say no one's on board.

23:53.520 --> 23:55.500
But wait, Obi-Wan and Leia aren't droids.

23:55.500 --> 23:56.680
They would know someone's on board.

23:56.680 --> 23:59.340
It doesn't matter, though, because they find out where Obi-Wan went anyway.

23:59.340 --> 24:01.820
Because Riva mind-sucked the information out of Haja.

24:01.820 --> 24:03.300
Wait a minute.

24:03.300 --> 24:04.300
Mind-suck the information?

24:04.300 --> 24:07.660
Yeah, I know that Kylo Ren did that to Poe, and that was justified because Vader kinda

24:07.660 --> 24:09.240
did it to Luke in Return of the Jedi.

24:09.240 --> 24:12.980
Though that scene seemed like less of a mind-suck and more of a sensing-his-feelings sort of

24:12.980 --> 24:13.980
thing.

24:13.980 --> 24:18.840
But if Jedis and Siths can actually mind-suck information out of people, why didn't Vader

24:18.840 --> 24:22.580
just do that to Leia without resorting to the drug droid in Episode 4?

24:22.580 --> 24:25.580
After Riva got the archives, why didn't she just go to Alderaan?

24:25.580 --> 24:26.580
Okay, it's guarded.

24:26.580 --> 24:30.380
Wait with Bail at some official Empire function, then, and mind-suck him there to find out

24:30.380 --> 24:31.380
where Kenobi is.

24:31.380 --> 24:34.180
Bail clearly knows, and Riva knows he knows.

24:34.180 --> 24:38.320
And oh boy, if she did that, wouldn't that unearth a treasure trove of information.

24:38.320 --> 24:42.620
At this point in the timeline, not any Legends retcon shit, but Disney's own lore, Bail

24:42.620 --> 24:46.500
Organa is the secret leader of the Rebel Alliance in the Star Wars Rebels show.

24:46.500 --> 24:49.900
That's one big fuckin' way to blow your cover, Bail, and risk the entirety of the

24:49.900 --> 24:53.220
Rebel Alliance by sticking your neck out towards Obi-Wan stupidly.

24:53.220 --> 24:56.700
Also, why didn't Bail ask any of the Jedi that are part of the Rebel Alliance at this

24:56.700 --> 25:00.180
point, including Ahsoka Tano, who is Darth Vader's former Padawan?

25:00.180 --> 25:03.800
You know, maybe Obi-Wan would want to know that she's alive, considering their mutual

25:03.800 --> 25:05.300
familial bond with Anakin.

25:05.300 --> 25:09.820
Hell, Bail would know that Darth Vader is still around, being a Senator himself.

25:09.820 --> 25:13.860
And though we never see it on screen, presumably he knows that Darth Vader is Anakin, since

25:13.860 --> 25:17.100
he's present at the secret meeting at the end of Revenge of the Sith.

25:17.100 --> 25:20.540
Why wouldn't he tell Obi-Wan, hey if you're gonna go save Leia for me, just know that

25:20.540 --> 25:21.980
Anakin still rang around out there?

25:21.980 --> 25:24.820
Is it because he thinks Obi-Wan won't take the job if he knows?

25:24.820 --> 25:26.220
What an asshole.

25:26.220 --> 25:28.260
After arriving on the planet, I don't even remember what it's called, it's just

25:28.260 --> 25:29.780
the mining planet, cause fuck it.

25:29.780 --> 25:33.100
After learning that Anakin is still alive, Obi-Wan's having PTSD visions of him off

25:33.100 --> 25:34.100
in the distance.

25:34.100 --> 25:35.600
Well, actually, just one vision.

25:35.600 --> 25:36.600
And they never bring it up again.

25:36.600 --> 25:39.540
They could have done something really cool with this idea, but they just drop it.

25:39.540 --> 25:43.580
Instead, we get more out-of-character dialogue between Obi-Wan and Leia again, and this time

25:43.580 --> 25:45.060
it's really weird.

25:45.060 --> 25:48.860
This is where he told us to come to.

25:48.860 --> 25:51.000
Maybe they're just late?

25:51.000 --> 25:52.000
Maybe it was a lie.

25:52.000 --> 25:53.000
I knew it.

25:53.000 --> 25:54.000
I never should have trusted him.

25:54.000 --> 25:55.460
We don't know his name.

25:55.460 --> 25:57.400
No one is coming here, Leia.

25:57.400 --> 25:59.820
Holy jeez, chill out dude, you just got here.

25:59.820 --> 26:03.280
They hitch a ride with cloaca face here when a bunch of soldiers looking for a Jedi pile

26:03.280 --> 26:04.280
in.

26:04.280 --> 26:06.320
Shouldn't these guys recognize Obi-Wan?

26:06.320 --> 26:09.120
This is no ordinary Jedi.

26:09.120 --> 26:13.280
Kenobi is the last ember of a dying age.

26:13.280 --> 26:16.880
Surely the Empire would have told them which Jedi they're hunting out here, right?

26:16.880 --> 26:19.180
Are you sure he's even on this planet?

26:19.180 --> 26:21.500
They know what they're doing, Leia.

26:21.500 --> 26:24.460
You called her Leia.

26:24.460 --> 26:28.160
Oh my god, dude, they also know that Leia is missing.

26:28.160 --> 26:32.020
This is the kind of goof up that you'd see in Spaceballs or one of the Family Guy spoof

26:32.020 --> 26:33.020
movies.

26:33.020 --> 26:34.580
Not in an actual Star Wars show.

26:34.580 --> 26:38.260
Anyway, the soldiers somehow don't recognize him, and they get off at their stop, giving

26:38.260 --> 26:40.740
us space for another Obi-Wan-Leia bonding moment.

26:40.740 --> 26:42.740
Are you my real father?

26:42.740 --> 26:46.340
I wish I could say I was.

26:46.340 --> 26:50.020
Dude, is this you admitting that you wanted to fuck pad me?

26:50.020 --> 26:53.380
That makes this scene hit different.

26:53.380 --> 26:57.580
But our guy Freck sells him out at the next Imperial checkpoint because, I don't know,

26:57.580 --> 27:07.900
you talked about being a Jedi in the back seat?

27:07.900 --> 27:11.780
All throughout this show Obi-Wan has a bad fucking habit of spilling the beans in public,

27:11.780 --> 27:12.780
let me tell you.

27:12.780 --> 27:15.460
Obi-Wan is asked to step out of the vehicle and he complies.

27:15.460 --> 27:17.700
Good move dude, never fight the cops, always get your day in court.

27:17.700 --> 27:22.140
And the scanner droid is brought in to finally face ID him with the Empire's Facebook Chinese

27:22.140 --> 27:25.900
algorithm shit, upon which Obi-Wan blasts it in the camera, completely destroying it.

27:25.900 --> 27:28.980
Now we all remember in the original trilogy scanner droids being incredibly weak, and

27:28.980 --> 27:32.380
every time they show up they get downed in one shot, but they're actually not that fragile.

27:32.380 --> 27:35.820
Yeah, there's that scene in Empire where Han takes one out in two shots, but everyone always

27:35.820 --> 27:36.820
forgets the next line.

27:36.820 --> 27:39.380
I didn't hit it that hard, it must have had a self-destruct.

27:39.380 --> 27:43.000
Yeah, it purposely destroyed itself after sending information back to the Empire so

27:43.000 --> 27:44.920
that the Rebellion wouldn't get any intelligence.

27:44.920 --> 27:46.680
But I guess they're all just made out of paper mache now.

27:46.680 --> 27:50.640
In probably the second most notorious fight scene in the show, because a dude gratuitously

27:50.640 --> 27:54.800
falls into the laser gate and gets fucking vivisected, jesus christ, Obi-Wan takes out

27:54.800 --> 27:56.800
the stormtroopers but also takes out Freck.

27:56.800 --> 27:57.800
What the hell man?

27:57.800 --> 28:01.640
Obi-Wan doesn't know that Freck sold him out, he said that quietly to the stormtroopers.

28:01.640 --> 28:03.520
Look at Obi-Wan's face.

28:03.520 --> 28:06.280
It could have been just a routine check, it is a checkpoint you know.

28:06.280 --> 28:08.800
And Obi-Wan's just like, well fuck you, bonk.

28:08.800 --> 28:10.120
Dude just go around it.

28:10.120 --> 28:13.400
Just go around the laser wall, you're literally outdoors, it's a hill, go around it.

28:13.400 --> 28:17.160
Anyway, Tala, that chick from Game of Thrones, arrives and picks up Obi-Wan after slaughtering

28:17.160 --> 28:18.160
her own unit.

28:18.160 --> 28:19.160
Surprise!

28:19.160 --> 28:20.920
She's a mole within the Empire working for the Rebellion.

28:20.920 --> 28:24.320
And she reveals that if Obi-Wan was just a bit more patient, none of this would have

28:24.320 --> 28:25.320
happened.

28:25.320 --> 28:26.320
He gave you the right coordinates.

28:26.320 --> 28:28.320
I was on my way when the probes arrived but you'd already gone.

28:28.320 --> 28:30.520
I hadn't expected anyone to come.

28:30.520 --> 28:32.560
Oh, imagine that Obi-Wan.

28:32.560 --> 28:35.780
Look at just how many people died because you couldn't take a breather.

28:35.780 --> 28:36.780
Look at poor Freck.

28:36.780 --> 28:38.860
Also, guys, you're visible on the fucking street.

28:38.860 --> 28:40.780
Why didn't you put on stormtrooper armor?

28:40.780 --> 28:42.300
We know it comes off easy enough.

28:42.340 --> 28:45.300
Why didn't you suit up for this instead of running around the town square on your Jedi

28:45.300 --> 28:47.220
robes you should have left back on Tatooine?

28:47.220 --> 28:51.060
Tala brings them into the Jedi Underground Railroad where, stupidly, everybody who's

28:51.060 --> 28:53.060
passed through here has written their name on the wall.

28:53.060 --> 28:55.060
Why would you let anybody do this?

28:55.060 --> 28:58.860
If this place is ever discovered, the Empire now has a record of everybody who survived

28:58.860 --> 29:01.380
Order 66 and they'll be keeping an eye out for them.

29:01.380 --> 29:05.820
But there's no way that'll ever happen.

29:05.820 --> 29:09.740
Also, how many times are we going to get an origin story for the Rebel Alliance starbird

29:09.740 --> 29:10.740
symbol?

29:10.980 --> 29:13.900
It was the family crest of the noble house of Merrick, which featured prominently in

29:13.900 --> 29:15.020
The Force Unleashed.

29:15.020 --> 29:17.940
That whole storyline has been thrown into the Legends shitter, though, and replaced

29:17.940 --> 29:23.340
with this purple-haired chick who is a Mandalorian graffiti artist who started painting phoenixes

29:23.340 --> 29:25.540
on TIE fighters as a way of fighting the power.

29:25.540 --> 29:27.660
Also, maybe this dude from Rogue One did it.

29:27.660 --> 29:32.020
The wiki's not exactly clear, but the Kenobi show implies that it was actually started

29:32.020 --> 29:35.620
as an adaptation of the symbol of the Order of the Jedi, which was a lightsaber with wings.

29:35.620 --> 29:39.580
And after the path turned into the Rebellion, they kept an altered version of that symbol.

29:39.580 --> 29:43.980
In fact, it looks kind of like it fell prey to the corporate dumbing down of symbols,

29:43.980 --> 29:45.740
making it look all sleek and simplistic.

29:54.300 --> 29:55.580
Uh, you need to run.

29:59.900 --> 30:01.740
Run Obi-Wan, he can sense you.

30:01.740 --> 30:05.300
Obi-Wan, you're in the safehouse of the Underground Railroad and you're lit up like

30:05.300 --> 30:07.220
a forced Christmas tree, run.

30:07.260 --> 30:11.140
Obi-Wan stays behind to give Leia time to get the safety, but then Tala sends Leia ahead

30:11.140 --> 30:12.540
to go back for Obi-Wan.

30:12.540 --> 30:15.540
Everyone's just self-sacrificing all over the place, sending the little girl off on

30:15.540 --> 30:17.220
her own hoping that she'll make it.

30:17.220 --> 30:18.220
And she doesn't.

30:18.220 --> 30:19.220
Wait.

30:19.220 --> 30:20.220
How did Riva get ahead of her?

30:20.220 --> 30:22.280
Riva enters the tunnel that Leia goes down.

30:22.280 --> 30:23.660
How did she beat her there?

30:23.660 --> 30:26.060
Okay, let's assume that the tunnel has a branching path.

30:26.060 --> 30:30.140
That's the path that Obi-Wan and Tala go to attend the obligatory Vader confrontation.

30:30.140 --> 30:34.240
Leia's still ahead of Riva, so for Riva to get ahead of Leia, Leia has to double back,

30:34.240 --> 30:37.600
go down the other path, let Riva get ahead and then double back again.

30:37.600 --> 30:42.440
Or alternatively, it's just a giant labyrinth down there and therefore it was wildly irresponsible

30:42.440 --> 30:43.800
to let Leia go off on her own.

31:04.240 --> 31:10.480
Okay, okay, I get it, Obi-Wan's terrified.

31:10.480 --> 31:12.920
He's not ready to face Anakin again.

31:12.920 --> 31:16.800
But the way they shot and cut that scene is like he ran behind a pile of gravel and then

31:16.800 --> 31:17.960
came back out the same way.

31:17.960 --> 31:20.380
Like oops, I dropped my keys back there or something.

31:20.380 --> 31:21.960
The duel between them is kind of lame.

31:21.960 --> 31:24.080
Shadaversi does a great job breaking down this fight and many others.

31:24.080 --> 31:25.240
She should go check that shit out.

31:25.240 --> 31:28.060
But there's a point in this fight where we just break one of the most fundamental Star

31:28.060 --> 31:29.060
Wars rules.

31:29.060 --> 31:31.600
Anakin uses the force on Obi-Wan during a duel.

31:31.600 --> 31:35.320
Now this has never been directly confirmed except in, you know, video games where the

31:35.320 --> 31:38.120
game prevents you from doing this exact thing for this exact reason.

31:38.120 --> 31:41.800
But it's always been under everyone's impression that Jedis and Siths didn't use the force

31:41.800 --> 31:44.120
on each other directly because it would just be a waste of energy.

31:44.120 --> 31:47.480
You'd be able to counteract it, which is why Vader always force chokes at regular people,

31:47.480 --> 31:48.480
not Jedi.

31:48.480 --> 31:51.000
But I guess that's just not the case anymore, so I don't know.

31:51.000 --> 31:54.840
I gotta say, I do like the idea that Vader wants to torture the fuck out of Obi-Wan for

31:54.840 --> 31:58.800
revenge and just dunks him in the fire like he's a Dunkaroo cracker going into the plastic

31:58.800 --> 31:59.800
cheese sauce.

31:59.800 --> 32:04.000
When I left you, I was but a learner, now I am the master.

32:04.000 --> 32:06.840
Yeah, when you learned how to burn my fucking arm off.

32:06.840 --> 32:11.240
Then Vader extinguishes the flames with the force, which I didn't know was a power but

32:11.240 --> 32:12.240
alright.

32:12.240 --> 32:16.240
And then Tala saves the day by shooting a random stormtrooper, which isn't shoot Vader,

32:16.240 --> 32:17.240
no.

32:17.240 --> 32:18.900
Also, Vader doesn't somehow censor there.

32:18.900 --> 32:22.320
And everyone reacts like they have no idea where the shot came from despite her using

32:22.320 --> 32:25.340
a blaster, even though you can see the bright flash of light from it.

32:25.340 --> 32:29.680
So Tala reignites the fire with the blaster, creating an impenetrable barrier between Obi-Wan

32:29.680 --> 32:34.200
and the stormtroopers, allowing Tala's loader to scoop Obi-Wan up and carry him to safety.

32:34.200 --> 32:38.080
Vader doesn't extinguish the flames again, the stormtroopers don't, you know, walk around

32:38.080 --> 32:40.440
the huge blaze, nope, nothing.

32:40.440 --> 32:44.560
Obi-Wan just gets away, because fuck it, I guess we're not even trying anymore.

32:44.560 --> 32:48.920
Episode 4 opens with Obi-Wan getting dunked into the bacta tank at the rebel base on Jabiim,

32:48.920 --> 32:53.300
where we see his hallucinations about Anakin, intercut with Anakin himself, also in a bacta

32:53.300 --> 32:54.300
tank.

32:54.300 --> 32:57.880
I guess he has to sit in one because of his burns, which is a nice touch, um, thematically

32:57.880 --> 32:58.880
I mean.

32:59.080 --> 33:02.560
Meanwhile, Leia is held captive at the fortress inquisitorious, which is first shown in the

33:02.560 --> 33:07.680
video game Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order, which, by the way, had a much hotter sister inquisitor

33:07.680 --> 33:08.680
villain.

33:08.680 --> 33:10.720
I guess that's why she's the second sister in Riva's the Third.

33:10.720 --> 33:15.040
Almost immediately during the interrogation, Leia spills the beans.

33:15.040 --> 33:18.640
The Empire doesn't take kindly to Jedi sympathizers.

33:18.640 --> 33:20.240
He will come for me.

33:20.240 --> 33:23.520
Yep, no plausible deniability, just Obi-Wan will come for me.

33:23.520 --> 33:25.260
That's it, that's the end of the Organas.

33:25.260 --> 33:27.880
The Empire should just liquidate the entire family at this point.

33:27.880 --> 33:31.560
And yeah, I know, Riva's actually got ulterior motives, but how about these guys?

33:31.560 --> 33:35.160
Do you think they're not going to tell their superiors about the link between Leia and

33:35.160 --> 33:38.280
Obi-Wan after Riva goes off the Imperial Plantation?

33:38.280 --> 33:41.080
How in the fuck did Leia ever become a senator after this?

33:41.080 --> 33:43.360
Wait a minute, why did Leia become a senator?

33:43.360 --> 33:46.700
Surely that kind of job would have brought her in contact with Vader and Palpatine plenty

33:46.700 --> 33:47.700
of times.

33:47.700 --> 33:52.080
Wasn't the whole point that the Sith could sense the kids, so they needed to be in isolation?

33:52.080 --> 33:56.180
Hidden, safe, the children must be kept.

33:56.180 --> 33:59.900
We must take them somewhere where the Sith will not sense their presence.

33:59.900 --> 34:02.180
How did Vader not sense her on the Death Star?

34:02.180 --> 34:05.940
Once Obi-Wan wakes up, he talks to the local leader of the Rebellion in order to try and

34:05.940 --> 34:07.600
get some help retrieving Leia.

34:07.600 --> 34:09.820
Which is when Tala drops this bomb.

34:09.820 --> 34:13.940
She knows everything, where we are, what we're doing.

34:13.940 --> 34:14.940
Why?

34:14.940 --> 34:19.340
Why would you entrust a ten year old kid with all of your plans like... wait, when did you

34:19.340 --> 34:20.340
entrust her?

34:20.340 --> 34:21.340
Was it this scene?

34:21.340 --> 34:23.940
We have safe houses like this throughout the galaxy.

34:23.940 --> 34:26.180
It all leads to Jabin.

34:26.180 --> 34:29.060
From there we give them new identities and get them out.

34:29.060 --> 34:30.860
Does it look like Leia is listening?

34:30.860 --> 34:33.100
I don't know anything about a path.

34:33.100 --> 34:35.820
That's actually true, Leia knows literally nothing.

34:35.820 --> 34:38.900
Actually this whole scene, every single line, is a bomb.

34:38.900 --> 34:41.540
You've no idea what the Empire is capable of.

34:41.540 --> 34:45.900
These people have been fighting for years, you've been in a fucking cave this whole time,

34:45.900 --> 34:46.900
what do you know?

34:46.900 --> 34:49.860
But this comment prompts the leader to give an emotionally hollow speech about his dead

34:49.860 --> 34:50.860
wife.

34:50.860 --> 34:52.860
I had a wife once.

34:52.860 --> 34:56.500
So I know exactly what the Empire can do.

34:56.500 --> 35:00.580
This guy, he goes from not helping to helping in the span of about 30 seconds.

35:00.580 --> 35:02.700
I'm sorry, but that's not my problem.

35:02.700 --> 35:05.460
Look, if you want my help, you got it.

35:05.460 --> 35:10.020
In fact he talks himself into it with the dead wife speech, it's not like Obi-Wan convinces

35:10.020 --> 35:11.020
him.

35:11.020 --> 35:14.420
So they begin to plan the assault of the fortress inquisitorious, and I swear this episode is

35:14.420 --> 35:15.980
the worst of the bunch.

35:15.980 --> 35:16.980
Listen in here.

35:16.980 --> 35:17.980
I don't see any shields.

35:17.980 --> 35:20.360
That's because no one would be stupid enough to attack me.

35:20.360 --> 35:21.460
How does that make any sense?

35:21.460 --> 35:23.780
Isn't that the opposite of how it works?

35:23.780 --> 35:26.740
People would be too smart to attack if it was too heavily fortified?

35:26.740 --> 35:30.500
But wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, five years earlier in the timeline, during

35:30.500 --> 35:35.540
Jedi Fallen Order, a game which everybody, Disney, EA, went to great lengths to ensure

35:35.540 --> 35:40.820
is actually canon, Cal Kestis goes to the fortress inquisitorious in the exact same

35:40.820 --> 35:45.940
way that Obi-Wan does, but this time it has shields that need to be taken down.

35:45.940 --> 35:48.620
I've disabled the shields on the outer sections of the fortress.

35:48.620 --> 35:50.220
I don't see any shields.

35:50.220 --> 35:52.440
That's because no one would be stupid enough to attack me.

35:52.440 --> 35:55.860
With the defenses they got, our usual tricks just aren't going to cut it.

35:55.860 --> 35:57.460
I don't see any shields.

35:57.460 --> 35:59.860
That's because no one would be stupid enough to attack me.

35:59.860 --> 36:01.100
It's impenetrable, Wade.

36:01.100 --> 36:02.700
I don't see any shields.

36:02.700 --> 36:05.020
That's because no one would be stupid enough to attack me.

36:05.020 --> 36:10.460
Somehow, some fucking how, Tala's cover is still intact, even though she, you know, gunned

36:10.460 --> 36:15.120
down her own squad at Imperial checkpoint, and the Empire was there that same evening

36:15.120 --> 36:16.120
investigating the planet.

36:16.120 --> 36:17.980
I guess they just missed that.

36:17.980 --> 36:36.660
I know that when most people watch this scene, their knee-jerk response is to say that her

36:36.660 --> 36:41.140
bullshitting and rank pulling wouldn't work, because people do have assigned posts, and

36:41.140 --> 36:44.560
you can't just bull your way through somebody else's command, especially in a sensitive

36:44.560 --> 36:48.180
area like this, which are all things that you would know if you talked to anybody with

36:48.180 --> 36:49.800
any military experience.

36:49.800 --> 36:54.320
But to me, the more pressing problem is that when he stuck her ID rod into the computer,

36:54.320 --> 36:58.900
a big flashing screen should have popped up telling him that her own squad was found dead

36:58.900 --> 37:03.940
and she was missing on a planet where Obi-Wan and Leia were sighted dealing with the Rebels.

37:03.940 --> 37:06.540
The exact same Leia that's in their basement now.

37:06.540 --> 37:11.260
And so begins the worst infiltration in probably all of cinema history.

37:11.260 --> 37:15.540
Palla is just hanging out around other Imperials, openly talking to Obi-Wan on the mic.

37:15.540 --> 37:19.740
In fact, this guy even notices her, and he's like, yeah, that's kind of weird, but it's

37:19.740 --> 37:20.980
almost time for my break.

37:20.980 --> 37:25.280
She is, of course, discovered, upon which she goes with the officer behind a large computer

37:25.280 --> 37:30.320
in the same room and knocks him out, again, in the same room that all the other officers

37:30.320 --> 37:31.320
are doing their work in.

37:31.320 --> 37:33.040
Do these guys just not hear what's going on?

37:33.040 --> 37:37.280
Do they not think it's weird she just comes back after getting told to report to security?

37:37.300 --> 37:40.020
This is some Metal Gear Solid level of hide-the-guard shit.

37:55.720 --> 37:59.480
At the deepest level of the fortress, down where Riva is torturing Leia, put a big pin

37:59.480 --> 38:03.020
in that, we'll get back to it, Obi-Wan discovers the big secret of the facility.

38:03.020 --> 38:06.460
It's actually a tomb for all the dead Jedi from Order 66.

38:06.640 --> 38:09.040
At least, that's what Obi-Wan assumes it is.

38:09.040 --> 38:11.800
But if it is a tomb, why does it look like they're frozen in place from the moment they

38:11.800 --> 38:12.800
died?

38:12.800 --> 38:13.800
Like, look at this kid.

38:13.800 --> 38:15.680
It looks like he's been time-stopped right when he got shot.

38:15.680 --> 38:19.480
The cynical part of me wants to say that Disney is going to come out in some future show and

38:19.480 --> 38:22.520
say, oh, those guys down there weren't dead, they were just in stasis.

38:22.520 --> 38:26.080
That's why they all look like that, and that's how they can bring back any character they

38:26.080 --> 38:27.080
want.

38:27.080 --> 38:28.080
You want a Mace Windu show?

38:28.080 --> 38:29.080
It's okay, they put them back together after the fall.

38:29.080 --> 38:30.720
You want an Aayla Secura show?

38:30.720 --> 38:31.900
Everyone likes blue girls.

38:31.900 --> 38:33.280
You want a Kit Fisto show?

38:33.280 --> 38:35.040
With a name like that, pair them with Aayla.

38:35.040 --> 38:38.260
So these guys can't be in stasis, can they?

38:38.260 --> 38:40.580
That was the whole point of carbonite freezing in Empire.

38:40.580 --> 38:44.060
Nobody had developed the technology to put people into stasis yet, or at least technology

38:44.060 --> 38:45.620
that would reliably work on a Jedi.

38:45.620 --> 38:50.000
The whole middle arc of Empire, on the Imperial side anyway, was Vader trying to find a way

38:50.000 --> 38:54.620
to incapacitate Luke, and he finally settled on jerry-rigging Lando's gas-refining equipment.

38:54.620 --> 38:56.540
We only use this facility for carbon freezing.

38:56.540 --> 38:58.020
You put him in there, it might kill him.

38:58.020 --> 39:00.620
I do not want the Emperor's prize damaged.

39:00.620 --> 39:04.220
We will test it on Captain Solo.

39:04.220 --> 39:09.440
The only logical conclusion is that this place is as Obi-Wan said.

39:09.440 --> 39:12.560
But if that's the case, then this scene serves no purpose in the show.

39:12.560 --> 39:14.240
They don't come back here and do anything.

39:14.240 --> 39:15.440
This information never comes up again.

39:15.440 --> 39:19.520
If it's meant to show how bad the Empire is that they're turning Jedi corpses into

39:19.520 --> 39:21.720
trophies, I mean, yeah, alright.

39:21.720 --> 39:27.640
But at this point we all already know how bad the Empire is.

39:27.640 --> 39:28.640
Yes we do, Obi-Wan.

39:28.640 --> 39:29.840
We always have.

39:29.840 --> 39:34.540
The scene where Obi-Wan solid snakes into the torture chamber and saves Leia is actually

39:34.540 --> 39:35.540
great.

39:35.540 --> 39:39.460
The idea of a Jedi using darkness to his advantage by turning off his lightsaber so you can't

39:39.460 --> 39:40.460
see him.

39:40.460 --> 39:41.460
You haven't seen that before and I kinda like it.

39:41.460 --> 39:43.900
Hey, shouldn't our helmets have night vi- ahhhh!

39:43.900 --> 39:47.660
Meanwhile, Talib breaks free from her stormtrooper guard, yeah she got caught and brought to

39:47.660 --> 39:50.740
security a second time, by slapping him in the face.

39:50.740 --> 39:51.820
Yes, really.

39:51.820 --> 39:55.620
At this point, stormtrooper armor seems to make people less defended when they put it

39:55.620 --> 39:56.620
on.

39:56.620 --> 39:59.320
Obi-Wan's first card, getting the Darth Maul treatment, is the second most notorious

39:59.320 --> 40:00.580
action scene in Kenobi.

40:00.580 --> 40:01.820
This one is the first.

40:01.820 --> 40:06.240
As Obi-Wan and Leia escape, he accidentally deflects a blaster bolt into the pressurized

40:06.240 --> 40:09.480
glass, causing the weight of the ocean to breach into the hallway.

40:09.480 --> 40:13.560
Obi-Wan tells Tala to take Leia and escape while he uses his force powers to hold the

40:13.560 --> 40:14.560
water back.

40:14.560 --> 40:18.160
And the show presents this like it's a great magical moment, like this is when Obi-Wan

40:18.160 --> 40:20.000
finally gets his force mojo back.

40:20.000 --> 40:23.400
In fact, they even set it up earlier in the episode, where Obi-Wan is struggling to spin

40:23.400 --> 40:27.540
a fidget spinner using the force, and Tala is like, you've got PTSD.

40:27.540 --> 40:30.980
Like this hallway scene is the big moment where Obi-Wan re-communes with the force,

40:30.980 --> 40:32.480
but we already had this moment.

40:32.480 --> 40:34.980
We had it when Obi-Wan catches Leia on Daewoo.

40:34.980 --> 40:39.780
Their final plan is to justâ€¦ walk right through the crowd, with Leia underneath Obi-Wan's

40:39.780 --> 40:40.780
coat.

40:40.780 --> 40:44.500
I've seen soy boys online defend this scene, saying that Star Wars should have comedy,

40:44.500 --> 40:45.980
and yes I completely agree.

40:45.980 --> 40:50.220
C-3PO, R2-D2, Chewie, Anakin's banter in the same movie he becomes one of cinema's

40:50.220 --> 40:51.220
greatest villains.

40:52.220 --> 40:59.440
Even the more questionable choices like the Ewoks or Jar Jar, fine, Star Wars should have

40:59.440 --> 41:00.520
moments of comedy.

41:00.520 --> 41:05.100
But just as this scene or this scene or this scene shouldn't be a moment of comedy, neither

41:05.100 --> 41:06.380
should this scene.

41:06.380 --> 41:10.800
In fact, one of the main reasons that this show rapes the old lore is because it actually

41:10.800 --> 41:14.980
turns this scene into a farce with Leia's complete non-reaction.

41:14.980 --> 41:20.080
You have to have a specific type of anti-talent to ruin genuinely good movies and turn serious

41:20.080 --> 41:23.200
scenes into comedic scenes with your new incompetent additions.

41:23.200 --> 41:26.440
Like I don't even know if I can overstate just how stupid this is, and the show just

41:26.440 --> 41:27.440
lets it happen.

41:27.440 --> 41:28.440
No one's blinking an eye.

41:28.440 --> 41:32.120
For some reason, nobody can tell that Obi-Wan's coat is a fucking circus tent.

41:32.120 --> 41:34.000
Nobody's stopping them, they just waltz right out into the hangar.

41:34.000 --> 41:38.400
General Obi-Wan Kenobi, years ago you snuggled me out of the Imperial base underneath your

41:38.400 --> 41:39.400
trench coat.

41:39.400 --> 41:43.600
In fact, even after Riva actually stops them, people are still going about their business.

41:43.600 --> 41:44.600
Guys, do you mind?

41:44.600 --> 41:45.760
We're trying to do a scene here.

41:45.760 --> 41:48.200
The Rebels show up in two snowspeeders to pick them up.

41:48.200 --> 41:50.840
One speeder occupies Riva, while the other picks up the gang.

41:50.840 --> 41:53.320
I guess all three of them fit into the back of a speeder now?

41:53.320 --> 41:55.560
Y'all know those things only hold two people, right?

41:55.560 --> 41:56.560
One pilot, one gunner?

41:56.560 --> 41:59.880
Did Obi-Wan, Leia, and Tala just cram themselves in the back?

41:59.880 --> 42:02.400
Is Leia's face squished up against the glass?

42:02.400 --> 42:05.380
They never show them getting in it, so I guess we're just not supposed to think about it.

42:05.380 --> 42:10.840
After the tragic death of Wade, oh no, that guy.

42:10.840 --> 42:14.040
I guess he's wading in the ocean now.

42:14.040 --> 42:16.120
They return back home to the Rebel base.

42:16.120 --> 42:17.120
Wait a second, though.

42:17.120 --> 42:19.320
The fortress Inquisitorius is on the planet Nur.

42:19.320 --> 42:20.760
Nur is a water world.

42:20.760 --> 42:22.000
It's a moon of Mustafar.

42:22.000 --> 42:25.040
Mustafar is the infamous lava planet where Anakin got barbecued.

42:25.040 --> 42:28.380
But more importantly, at this point, it's the place where Darth Vader has built his

42:28.380 --> 42:31.680
upstate cottage, for when he needs a getaway from the everyday life of running the Empire.

42:31.680 --> 42:35.760
Yes, I know, it's symbolic, because Vader's emotionally stuck at the point where he lost

42:35.760 --> 42:38.440
everything and now he's also physically stuck there, too.

42:38.440 --> 42:39.440
Fine, fine.

42:39.440 --> 42:43.920
But how in the holy hell do the Rebels even get into Darth Vader's personal star system

42:43.920 --> 42:44.920
without getting noticed?

42:44.920 --> 42:45.920
It's in the Mustafar system.

42:46.920 --> 42:51.400
Why isn't there star destroyers or something in orbit around both Vader's castle and the

42:51.400 --> 42:52.600
fortress Inquisitorius?

42:52.600 --> 42:53.600
And how did the Rebels get away?

42:53.600 --> 42:55.400
Why didn't they scramble ships?

42:55.400 --> 42:59.700
Even if there's, somehow, nobody in orbit, you've got ships in the hangar.

42:59.700 --> 43:02.600
Episode 5 opens with a tribute to Wade, our fallen comrade.

43:02.600 --> 43:06.600
All right, right behind you.

43:06.600 --> 43:07.600
Wade!

43:07.600 --> 43:10.880
I'm actually surprised they remembered to put him in the recap.

43:10.880 --> 43:13.920
I figured something that sullen would have weighed the episode down.

43:13.920 --> 43:14.920
Okay, I'm done.

43:14.920 --> 43:15.920
I'm done.

43:15.920 --> 43:16.920
That's the last one.

43:16.920 --> 43:19.920
This episode is interspersed with flashbacks to Attack of the Clones, from when Anakin

43:19.920 --> 43:22.960
was a Padawan and Obi-Wan was still training him in how to fight.

43:22.960 --> 43:24.760
Using real lightsabers, though, for some reason.

43:24.760 --> 43:28.240
And it looks like they kinda de-aged Hayden Christensen.

43:28.240 --> 43:29.240
Not really, you know.

43:29.240 --> 43:32.700
It looks like they cast a 40-year-old man to play a 20-year-old and used the latest

43:32.700 --> 43:35.320
technology to de-age him to about 35.

43:35.320 --> 43:39.080
In fact, we know this could have been done better because somebody did do it better.

43:39.080 --> 43:40.080
Look at these two scenes.

43:40.080 --> 43:43.280
Disney, how do you fuck up turning on a Snapchat filter?

43:43.280 --> 43:47.600
Flash forward to the present day, where it turns out that Riva is being made Grand Inquisitor

43:47.600 --> 43:48.880
because of her cunning plan.

43:48.880 --> 43:52.540
You see, it was all a ploy on her part that Obi-Wan would escape, because she put a tracker

43:52.540 --> 43:56.440
on him, and now they'll lead the Empire back to the Rebel base, where a hacked Lola

43:56.440 --> 43:58.040
will disable their defenses from the inside.

43:58.040 --> 44:01.920
A plan which requires Lola to have the ability to open a maintenance hatch without touching

44:01.920 --> 44:02.920
it.

44:02.920 --> 44:03.920
Must be some pretty strong magnets in there.

44:03.920 --> 44:08.200
The tracker and hacker on Lola, by the way, is one of those restraining bolts that we've

44:08.200 --> 44:09.200
seen previously.

44:09.200 --> 44:13.100
In A New Hope, it didn't actually alter the personalities of R2-D2 or C-3PO.

44:13.100 --> 44:15.580
It just let them be immobilized by a remote control.

44:15.580 --> 44:18.460
But okay, let's assume that Lola's been turned evil by a restraining bolt.

44:18.460 --> 44:21.660
Oh, if only you had noticed the Terminator eye sooner, Leia.

44:21.660 --> 44:22.660
Wait a minute!

44:22.660 --> 44:24.520
How did Leia even get Lola back?

44:24.520 --> 44:28.220
Lola tried to attack Riva with her micro saw blade during the interrogation scene.

44:28.220 --> 44:30.020
That's pretty dangerous for a kid's toy, by the way.

44:30.020 --> 44:34.900
But Riva easily subdued Lola with the Force, and immediately after took Leia to the torture

44:34.900 --> 44:35.900
chamber.

44:35.900 --> 44:39.000
Riva was called away by Talos' distraction, and that's when Obi-Wan does the splinter

44:39.000 --> 44:40.340
cell thing to rescue her.

44:40.340 --> 44:44.620
At this point, the only other time Riva and Leia are even in the same room is during the

44:44.620 --> 44:46.460
escape, where Riva is a bit preoccupied.

44:46.460 --> 44:50.660
And it's not like anybody else knew to give the droid back to her, because Vader and the

44:50.660 --> 44:54.860
other Inquisitors are royally pissed off until Riva explains her gambit.

44:54.860 --> 44:56.380
And yet, Leia's got Lola.

44:56.380 --> 45:00.860
Either Lola flew out of Riva's pocket into the speeder on her own, off screen, or were

45:00.860 --> 45:05.420
being asked to believe that Riva, in between the interrogation scene where she first grabbed

45:05.420 --> 45:09.300
Lola, and the immediate march down to the torture chamber, took a side detour to mess

45:09.340 --> 45:12.460
with the droid and then give it back to Leia, also off screen.

45:12.460 --> 45:16.620
Disney didn't rate this show with the intention that your brain be engaged while watching

45:16.620 --> 45:17.620
it.

45:17.620 --> 45:20.360
But all the Defenders online are saying, hey, you see, this show is smart.

45:20.360 --> 45:23.420
This explains how Leia knew they were being tracked in Episode 4.

45:23.420 --> 45:24.420
They let us go.

45:24.420 --> 45:27.180
It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape.

45:27.180 --> 45:28.180
Easy.

45:28.180 --> 45:29.180
You call that easy?

45:29.180 --> 45:30.180
They're tracking us.

45:30.180 --> 45:33.060
It happened to Leia as a kid, so she can see it coming as an adult.

45:33.060 --> 45:34.060
Smart writing.

45:34.060 --> 45:37.460
Except it's not, because this makes Obi-Wan look like a complete fucking buffoon.

45:37.620 --> 45:41.580
Obi-Wan did the very same thing to Jango Fett in Attack of the Clones.

45:41.580 --> 45:44.140
Why didn't he see it coming, then, like Leia did?

45:44.140 --> 45:47.160
Lola's there, I guess, and transmitting information back to the Empire.

45:47.160 --> 45:50.860
The Rebels are planning to evacuate, because, you know, the Imperials are closing in.

45:50.860 --> 45:55.540
The reason that the Anakin-Obi-Wan training flashback is even in this episode is so that

45:55.540 --> 45:59.580
Obi-Wan can reflect on Anakin's fighting style and use that knowledge to make this

45:59.580 --> 46:00.580
remark.

46:00.580 --> 46:01.580
He'll attack next.

46:01.580 --> 46:02.900
He has the patience for siege.

46:02.900 --> 46:04.060
Okay, fair enough.

46:04.060 --> 46:08.180
But this turns out to be a completely irrelevant insight, because the Empire could just bomb

46:08.180 --> 46:09.180
them from orbit.

46:09.180 --> 46:13.060
And I don't know why they don't, because their only objective is to kill everyone there.

46:13.060 --> 46:17.120
Instead, they opt to send troops down with a huge gun, which ends up being completely

46:17.120 --> 46:18.760
useless against the blast doors.

46:18.760 --> 46:22.900
It's okay, though, because the blast doors get instantly shredded by Riva's lightsaber

46:22.900 --> 46:23.900
anyway.

46:23.900 --> 46:26.660
I guess patience for a siege wasn't necessary after all, eh, Obi-Wan?

46:26.660 --> 46:32.240
Hey, remember when it took Qui-Gon Jinn several minutes of stern concentration with his lightsaber

46:32.240 --> 46:34.680
to be able to melt a hole on a blast door?

46:34.680 --> 46:39.400
Meanwhile, Bail Organa sends a completely unnecessary, traceable, and highly sensitive

46:39.400 --> 46:42.440
message to Obi-Wan during the midst of all this, where he says,

46:42.440 --> 46:47.440
I know he said no communication, but your silence worries me.

46:47.440 --> 46:54.840
If he's found you, if he's learned of the children, if I don't hear from you soon, I'll

46:54.840 --> 46:55.840
head to Tatooine.

46:55.840 --> 46:58.640
Owen will need help with the boy.

46:58.640 --> 46:59.840
Oh, smart, dude.

46:59.840 --> 47:01.560
The fucking brain's on this guy.

47:01.560 --> 47:05.600
I think you've been found, so I'm going to send this message with secret info in it to

47:05.600 --> 47:06.600
you, Obi-Wan.

47:06.600 --> 47:09.400
Let's hope the Empire doesn't find it all.

47:09.400 --> 47:13.480
Immediately after this, Tala gives her Death Flag speech, and then Obi-Wan goes to the

47:13.480 --> 47:17.640
blast doors to buy the others time to escape, and to confront Riva, who also gives her Death

47:17.640 --> 47:28.560
Flag speech.

47:28.560 --> 47:32.520
The ensuing fight consists of stormtroopers pouring into the breach made by Riva's lightsaber,

47:32.520 --> 47:34.480
all of them missing every single shot.

47:34.480 --> 47:38.260
Okay, so I know you're stormtroopers, but Obi-Wan's the only target for a solid 10 seconds.

47:38.260 --> 47:39.260
How are you guys missing?

47:39.260 --> 47:40.260
Look at this dude.

47:40.260 --> 47:41.260
Where are you shooting?

47:41.260 --> 47:42.260
Obi-Wan is right there.

47:42.260 --> 47:43.260
What are you aiming at?

47:43.260 --> 47:47.780
Also, at this point, Disney has retconned the Force, such that we know a Jedi can stop

47:47.780 --> 47:50.940
blaster bolts in mid-air without having to deflect anything.

47:50.940 --> 47:53.400
Why doesn't Obi-Wan just pull a Neo and hold them back?

47:53.400 --> 47:56.800
I mean, we are going to see him do something equivalent by the end of the series, so why

47:56.800 --> 47:57.800
the fuck not?

47:58.040 --> 48:01.600
The fight is ended by Tala, who sacrifices herself by way of a thermal detonator.

48:01.600 --> 48:05.480
I don't know why she didn't just throw it, it's a grenade, she probably could have survived,

48:05.480 --> 48:07.520
but I guess Disney is hoping that you'll care.

48:07.520 --> 48:10.120
So the breach is sealed by Tala's sacrifice.

48:10.120 --> 48:13.840
Wait, not really, because Obi-Wan just walks back 15 seconds later.

48:13.840 --> 48:15.360
So why did this explosion stop the fighting?

48:15.360 --> 48:18.400
Yeah, it killed a bunch of people, but it didn't close the hole through the blast door,

48:18.400 --> 48:21.480
and there's clearly more stormtroopers, and you know what, whatever, I don't care anymore.

48:21.480 --> 48:25.360
Obi-Wan decides to go right back out there to sacrifice himself again, that's two times

48:25.360 --> 48:29.360
now in the span of two minutes, where he has another sensitive conversation out in

48:29.360 --> 48:32.800
the open, this time with Riva about her secret plan to kill Darth Vader.

48:32.800 --> 48:38.480
You're not bringing him to me, I'm bringing him to you.

48:38.480 --> 48:40.680
Jesus Christ, this time they're both retarded.

48:40.680 --> 48:44.200
Dude, the stormtroopers are right there, do you think they don't hear you plotting the

48:44.200 --> 48:46.280
assassination of Darth fucking Vader?

48:46.280 --> 48:49.960
And it's at this point that Riva unveils her grand plan.

48:49.960 --> 48:53.780
Okay so let me lay this out for you, you're going to want to get a drink for this.

48:53.940 --> 48:58.460
Riva is apparently one of the many Jedi who survived Order 66 as a youngling, right?

48:58.460 --> 49:01.480
Afterward she devoted herself to hunting and killing Darth Vader.

49:01.480 --> 49:04.220
Her plan was to become an Inquisitor, get close to Vader, and then knife him in the

49:04.220 --> 49:05.220
back.

49:05.220 --> 49:08.820
At the start of the series we're told that Riva has a weird obsession with finding Obi-Wan

49:08.820 --> 49:09.820
Kenobi.

49:09.820 --> 49:12.920
Everyone else has given up the hunt and they find Riva's obsession to be a bit off-putting.

49:12.920 --> 49:14.740
Great way for her to blow her cover, but whatever.

49:14.740 --> 49:18.420
Riva's plan is to, okay I gotta keep it together here.

49:18.420 --> 49:24.420
Riva's plan is to hire drug dealers on the slum planet of Diu to fly to Alderaan, a prosperous

49:24.420 --> 49:29.920
core world, bypass all of their security, kidnap Princess Leia, daughter of an Imperial

49:29.920 --> 49:31.420
Senator and the Queen of the planet.

49:31.420 --> 49:34.260
Wait a second, I thought Leia was a princess because Padme was Queen of Naboo.

49:34.260 --> 49:37.020
Oh but I guess that had to be kept secret because nobody's supposed to know about

49:37.020 --> 49:38.180
the Leia-Padme connection.

49:38.180 --> 49:42.540
In retrospect it kind of feels like in episode 1 the only reason Padme is a queen is to hint

49:42.540 --> 49:46.420
at the future relationship with Anakin where their daughter turns out to be a princess.

49:46.420 --> 49:49.860
But by episode 3 George Lucas realized this was supposed to be a secret so I guess she's

49:49.860 --> 49:51.620
got two queen mothers now.

49:51.620 --> 49:54.180
Jesus the fuckery that is Star Wars is getting to me.

49:54.180 --> 49:58.620
Riva's plan, okay hire the Diu drug dealers to kidnap Leia off the heavily fortified world

49:58.620 --> 49:59.620
of Alderaan.

49:59.620 --> 50:03.940
Then she hopes that Bail Organa calls up Obi-Wan for help rather than using any of his other

50:03.940 --> 50:05.360
resources at his disposal.

50:05.360 --> 50:10.540
Because according to the fabled archive files Bail Organa knows where Obi-Wan is and rather

50:10.540 --> 50:14.660
than just extract that information out of him Riva would rather Obi-Wan resurface on

50:14.660 --> 50:15.660
his own.

50:15.900 --> 50:17.700
If Obi-Wan takes the bait Riva will apprehend him.

50:17.700 --> 50:20.080
Or at least that's what she tells the other Inquisitors.

50:20.080 --> 50:25.180
Her actual plan, her actual plan is to get Obi-Wan in front of Vader so that he will

50:25.180 --> 50:27.300
be distracted enough that she can kill him.

50:27.300 --> 50:31.620
And when the first attempt to do that plan fails on Diu the second plan is to just do

50:31.620 --> 50:34.580
the exact same thing again at the fortress Inquisitorius.

50:34.580 --> 50:38.700
And when that plan fails the third plan is to do the exact same thing again at the Rebel

50:38.700 --> 50:39.700
base.

50:39.700 --> 50:42.820
Only this time the plan really fails because Darth Vader is fucking Darth Vader.

50:45.660 --> 50:53.540
He was wise to use you against me.

50:53.540 --> 50:54.540
Yeah that.

50:54.540 --> 50:58.900
So Leia fixes the hangar doors in time, Obi-Wan slips away from the stormtroopers, Haja accidentally

50:58.900 --> 51:01.580
drops Obi-Wan's secret message from Bail Organa.

51:01.580 --> 51:04.620
Yeah Haja is here too when he had the message, don't worry it's really not important.

51:04.620 --> 51:06.660
And everybody piles into the transport ready to go.

51:06.660 --> 51:10.180
Vader arrives just in time to pull the transport back with the force.

51:10.180 --> 51:14.920
And it's at this point everybody and I mean everybody gave up on this fucking show.

51:14.960 --> 51:19.240
If this is what the force can do now, why does Vader even bother with the lightsaber

51:19.240 --> 51:20.240
shit?

51:20.240 --> 51:22.640
Why doesn't he just pop people's heads like that one chick from the boys?

51:22.640 --> 51:26.520
When he had Obi-Wan strung up why not just immediately dismember him?

51:26.520 --> 51:27.520
Fuck it.

51:27.520 --> 51:30.160
Why didn't Vader just slam Luke into the carbonite freezer?

51:30.160 --> 51:34.120
Hell why didn't Vader hold back the Millennium Falcon, an empire?

51:34.120 --> 51:37.260
When the force is this strong it breaks the fucking canon.

51:37.260 --> 51:40.920
People were complaining about Starkiller pulling star destroyers out of orbit and force unleashed

51:40.920 --> 51:41.920
back in the day.

51:41.920 --> 51:46.920
And rightfully so, they made that game non-canon, but they brought back its most egregious component

51:46.920 --> 51:48.680
because fuck me I guess.

51:48.680 --> 51:52.680
But it's all okay because it was a fake ship and the real one gets away immediately

51:52.680 --> 51:53.680
after.

51:53.680 --> 51:55.160
Why doesn't Vader just hold back that one too?

51:55.160 --> 51:57.180
This is the same problem with that fire extinguisher scene.

51:57.180 --> 52:01.160
They establish a rule, an expectation in the viewer's mind of what can be done.

52:01.160 --> 52:04.860
And then they immediately violate it in the same scene because they've written themselves

52:04.860 --> 52:05.860
into a corner.

52:05.860 --> 52:08.280
Also, how did the Rebels know that Vader would do that?

52:08.280 --> 52:12.880
Is that another one of Obi-Wan's off-screen nuggets of wisdom based on Vader's personality?

52:12.880 --> 52:16.540
Or maybe Obi-Wan went on that When Disney World ride where Vader holds a ship back so

52:16.540 --> 52:17.540
he knows what's coming.

52:17.540 --> 52:19.640
Also, where is that second ship?

52:19.640 --> 52:22.760
Seriously you can't see it when the first ship flies off.

52:22.760 --> 52:23.760
Is it this?

52:23.760 --> 52:25.520
This blurry blob deep in the background?

52:25.520 --> 52:26.920
Is that the ship they're all on?

52:26.920 --> 52:28.560
It's a hell of a lot bigger when it takes off.

52:28.560 --> 52:30.920
Also, there's a star destroyer in orbit.

52:30.920 --> 52:35.200
I hope they don't just let the ship get away again like on Dayu to the mining planet

52:35.200 --> 52:38.560
or the mining planet to the rebel base or leaving the fortress inquisitorious.

52:38.560 --> 52:42.120
It really feels like the Empire is severely undermanned in this show.

52:42.120 --> 52:45.460
Like they've got maybe a couple dozen guys at best to do all of this shit.

52:45.460 --> 52:48.560
The confrontation between Riva and Vader is actually really interesting.

52:48.560 --> 52:52.400
Where Riva is just hopelessly outmatched to the point that Vader doesn't even draw his

52:52.400 --> 52:53.400
lightsaber.

52:53.400 --> 52:55.360
He simply blocks her attacks with the force.

52:55.360 --> 52:57.720
It's a new way of fighting we haven't really seen before in Star Wars.

52:57.720 --> 52:58.920
It almost feels like martial arts.

52:58.920 --> 53:03.320
But then the fight immediately dive bombs into what I can only describe as a Dark Souls

53:03.320 --> 53:04.320
role fight.

53:04.440 --> 53:07.140
Seriously, that's the only way to describe what Riva is doing here.

53:07.140 --> 53:10.840
Was the original plan for Riva to do some kind of Capoeira shit and the actress just

53:10.840 --> 53:13.520
couldn't pull the moves off so it came out looking like this?

53:13.520 --> 53:15.260
Why would you leave this farce in?

53:15.260 --> 53:17.280
Of course, the Grand Inquisitor is still alive.

53:17.280 --> 53:20.160
He survived getting stabbed in the gut just like Riva did as a child.

53:20.160 --> 53:22.880
Oh, and just like Riva did again as an adult.

53:22.880 --> 53:25.100
How many stomachs does Riva have, guys?

53:25.100 --> 53:27.440
And of course, they just leave her to bleed out.

53:27.440 --> 53:29.960
Riva manages to find the message that Haja dropped.

53:29.960 --> 53:32.800
It's damaged, but she fixes it enough to hear part of the message.

53:34.360 --> 53:37.960
If you've learned of the children, I'll hand them Tatooine.

53:40.280 --> 53:42.760
Owen, help the boy.

53:44.760 --> 53:48.280
Because Riva had that run-in with Uncle Owen in the first episode, when she hears that

53:48.280 --> 53:52.340
message that Bail Organa totally should not have sent, she recognizes that there's some

53:52.340 --> 53:56.160
sort of connection between Owen, specifically his son, and the Organa family.

53:56.160 --> 54:00.280
So she somehow manages to make her way to Tatooine, while wounded, and without any sort

54:00.280 --> 54:01.280
of interstellar transport.

54:01.280 --> 54:02.280
The Rebels have already left.

54:02.280 --> 54:03.280
The Imperials are gone.

54:03.280 --> 54:04.680
How the hell did she get off this rock?

54:04.680 --> 54:05.680
Are you okay?

54:05.680 --> 54:07.560
I just sensed a plot hole.

54:07.560 --> 54:11.400
Word gets back to Uncle Owen that an Inquisitor is coming, and the Lars family decides the

54:11.400 --> 54:14.520
best course of action isn't to skip town, go lay low.

54:14.520 --> 54:16.880
No, Aunt Beru wants to stand and fight.

54:16.880 --> 54:17.880
We need to leave, Beru.

54:17.880 --> 54:19.880
We need to take Luke and hide somewhere.

54:19.880 --> 54:20.880
Where?

54:20.880 --> 54:21.880
In the desert?

54:21.880 --> 54:23.280
I'm not leaving my home.

54:23.280 --> 54:24.800
At least here we have a chance.

54:24.800 --> 54:29.000
Remember, these guys don't know that Riva is injured and working alone and without the

54:29.000 --> 54:31.160
institutional backing of the Imperial State.

54:31.160 --> 54:34.040
Also, they know they're holding onto a child of destiny.

54:34.040 --> 54:36.800
I know it's stupid, but the show's acting this way, so let's just roll with it at this

54:36.800 --> 54:37.800
point.

54:37.800 --> 54:38.880
So surely they must have a plan.

54:38.880 --> 54:40.760
If the Empire ever came knocking.

54:40.760 --> 54:43.280
But nope, the plan is just castle doctrine.

54:43.280 --> 54:45.800
Get some rifles and fight them off from inside your own house.

54:45.800 --> 54:47.560
These people are fucking stupid.

54:47.560 --> 54:51.960
I expected this show to rape and butcher the characters of Obi-Wan and Darth Vader, but

54:51.960 --> 54:53.520
not Aunt fucking Beru.

54:53.520 --> 54:57.040
Obi-Wan stays behind to sacrifice himself and let the Rebels get away again.

54:57.040 --> 54:59.120
But this time, the gambit shouldn't work.

54:59.120 --> 55:01.720
The Empire is pursuing the Rebel ship and a Star Destroyer.

55:01.720 --> 55:05.340
You have more than enough resources to split them here and pursue both.

55:05.340 --> 55:08.440
My lord, we must continue our pursuit of the insurgents.

55:08.440 --> 55:14.320
Now is our chance to wipe out this network in its entirety.

55:14.320 --> 55:18.480
We cannot prioritize one lone Jedi.

55:18.480 --> 55:22.680
He is not just any Jedi.

55:22.680 --> 55:23.680
Follow Kenobi.

55:23.680 --> 55:26.000
At once, Lord Vader.

55:26.000 --> 55:27.000
And you know, I get it.

55:27.000 --> 55:30.320
You're showing that Vader is obsessed with Obi-Wan and it's blinding him.

55:30.320 --> 55:32.840
But look at the Grand Inquisitor's face in this scene.

55:32.840 --> 55:36.560
This is the look you make when you know that your boss just made the biggest mistake of

55:36.560 --> 55:37.560
his career.

55:37.560 --> 55:39.720
But you can't say anything because if you do, he'll fire you.

55:39.720 --> 55:44.100
It doesn't even make sense because when they arrive at the obligatory deserted dueling

55:44.100 --> 55:46.560
planet, Vader takes his personal shuttle down.

55:46.560 --> 55:49.140
These shuttles are capable of going into hyperdrive.

55:49.140 --> 55:52.840
There's no reason Vader couldn't have taken his shuttle to pursue Obi-Wan and left the

55:52.840 --> 56:00.700
pursuit of the rebels in the hands of the Grand Inquisitor on the Star Destroyer.

56:00.700 --> 56:03.720
Have you come to destroy me, Obi-Wan?

56:03.720 --> 56:05.480
Dude, you followed me here.

56:05.480 --> 56:08.520
Yeah, we're heading into the confrontation with Vader, which I know this show's been

56:08.520 --> 56:09.520
building up to.

56:09.520 --> 56:13.160
But it kind of deflates the emotional impact of their reuniting in A New Hope, doesn't

56:13.160 --> 56:14.160
it?

56:14.160 --> 56:15.160
I sense something.

56:15.160 --> 56:19.480
A presence I've not felt since Obi-Wan blasted my mask off nine years ago.

56:19.480 --> 56:23.200
And so begins the culmination of the emotional arc of the entire season, where Obi-Wan has

56:23.200 --> 56:27.120
faced his fears, he's got his mojo back, and he's ready to finally confront Vader.

56:27.120 --> 56:28.520
The fight is, again, actually pretty good.

56:28.520 --> 56:48.320
The music is even okay.

56:48.320 --> 56:51.600
So I have no idea why they didn't use Battle of the Heroes for Episode 3.

56:51.600 --> 56:53.560
The callback would be incredible, wouldn't it?

56:53.560 --> 57:18.240
Like here, just check out the same scene with Episode 3's music.

57:18.400 --> 57:19.400
Isn't that fucking incredible?

57:19.400 --> 57:23.600
While all this is going on, Riva sneaks onto the Lars homestead under the cover of darkness,

57:23.600 --> 57:26.600
and immediately reveals herself by igniting her lightsaber.

57:26.600 --> 57:29.900
Uncle Owen, now knowing where she is, takes a shot.

57:29.900 --> 57:30.900
And misses.

57:30.900 --> 57:32.900
Jesus, what a comedy of errors.

57:32.900 --> 57:44.600
Uncle Owen does get one badass moment, though, with this exchange with Riva.

57:44.600 --> 57:46.160
You know, gotta hand it to the guy.

57:46.160 --> 57:47.920
He's fighting an Inquisitor with a pipe.

57:47.920 --> 57:52.640
But unfortunately for Riva, Luke does what they all should have done hours ago, run into

57:52.640 --> 57:54.640
the desert.

57:54.640 --> 58:01.120
Meanwhile, back where the audience's focus and care actually resides, the Obi-Wan vs

58:01.120 --> 58:02.960
Anakin rematch is picking up the pace.

58:02.960 --> 58:04.500
A bit too much, actually.

58:04.500 --> 58:08.360
That really seems to be what's at the core of the cool-scene-itis problem with Disney's

58:08.360 --> 58:09.360
Star Wars.

58:09.360 --> 58:13.360
Even when they have a legitimately good idea, they turn it up so much it becomes entirely

58:13.360 --> 58:14.360
unbelievable.

58:14.360 --> 58:15.360
Check this bit out.

58:15.360 --> 58:20.200
Vader force throws a rock into Obi-Wan's leg so hard that the rock shatters and Obi-Wan

58:20.200 --> 58:21.200
goes down.

58:21.200 --> 58:23.800
Now, Obi-Wan shouldn't be getting up from that.

58:23.800 --> 58:26.080
That liquefied his fucking ankle, dude.

58:26.080 --> 58:31.680
Vader goes on to bury him in more rocks, while dropping the blandest possible one-liner.

58:31.680 --> 58:35.840
You have failed, master.

58:35.840 --> 58:36.840
Come on, man.

58:36.840 --> 58:40.640
At least say something like, I actually do have the high ground at Obi-Wan, would you

58:40.640 --> 58:41.640
look at that?

58:41.640 --> 58:45.280
Obi-Wan manages to hold out underneath the rock pile by creepily thinking of Luke and

58:45.280 --> 58:46.280
Leia.

58:46.280 --> 58:49.080
And this is clearly meant to be the moment where Obi-Wan is inspired by those who he

58:49.080 --> 58:50.960
has to protect to get his mojo back.

58:50.960 --> 58:51.960
For the 15th time.

58:51.960 --> 58:56.320
So Obi-Wan pulls himself out of the hole and oh come the fuck on.

58:56.320 --> 59:00.600
Remember when master fucking Yoda had to struggle to move just a few rocks?

59:00.600 --> 59:04.100
Remember when lifting an X-wing out of the swamp was considered the maximum extent of

59:04.100 --> 59:05.640
force levitation powers?

59:05.640 --> 59:09.700
Putting these kind of concrete restrictions on the use of the force makes Jedi more interesting.

59:09.700 --> 59:13.660
Because while they can do things others can't and they are extremely special, they're not

59:13.660 --> 59:18.020
overpowered, they don't break the story, and therefore even a good Jedi can be overcome

59:18.020 --> 59:19.780
if you come at the problem from the right angle.

59:19.780 --> 59:22.780
That's the point of the Mandalorians and their anti-Jedi weaponry.

59:22.780 --> 59:26.220
That's the point of Order 66 and overwhelming them with sheer numbers.

59:26.220 --> 59:29.980
But if Obi-Wan can actually act as a one-man artillery unit, then fuck it dude, just go

59:29.980 --> 59:30.980
home.

59:30.980 --> 59:33.340
Why didn't he cause the mountain to collapse and all of his clone troopers?

59:33.340 --> 59:36.780
Because the prequels, for all of their faults, weren't this stupid.

59:36.860 --> 59:40.860
Obi-Wan strikes the decisive blow on Vader's helmet, dramatically revealing his scarred face.

59:40.860 --> 59:44.140
His voice in this scene is a mixture of Anakin and Vader's, which is a nice touch.

59:44.140 --> 59:46.140
Anakin's gone.

59:46.140 --> 59:51.660
I am what remains.

59:51.660 --> 59:55.580
The way the shots are framed, where you get that close-up of Anakin's disfigured, vulnerable

59:55.580 --> 59:59.980
face beneath the terror-inducing Vader mask, how the scene is only lit by the glow of their

59:59.980 --> 01:00:04.140
lightsabers, how Anakin's face flashes with 50 different emotions after Obi-Wan apologizes

01:00:04.140 --> 01:00:05.140
to him.

01:00:05.140 --> 01:00:06.940
Obi-Wan is a money shot at the entire show.

01:00:06.940 --> 01:00:09.860
Every character moment has pushed Obi-Wan towards letting go of his guilt.

01:00:09.860 --> 01:00:17.940
And when Obi-Wan says, I'm sorry Anakin, for all of it, he's taking responsibility.

01:00:17.940 --> 01:00:21.020
Not just for what he did to Anakin in their fight, but for how he failed Anakin, for what

01:00:21.020 --> 01:00:22.020
Anakin became.

01:00:22.020 --> 01:00:25.940
Obi-Wan is saying, even for the things that he's not responsible for, he's sorry that

01:00:25.940 --> 01:00:27.500
things turned out how they did.

01:00:27.500 --> 01:00:30.860
And Anakin, in a way, absolves him of all that responsibility.

01:00:30.860 --> 01:00:35.300
That tiny flash of an evil smile shows Obi-Wan that Anakin actually likes who he's become.

01:00:35.300 --> 01:00:40.060
I am absolutely convinced that this is the scene the writers base this entire show around.

01:00:40.060 --> 01:00:41.540
The ultimate case of cool-scene-itis.

01:00:41.540 --> 01:00:46.180
Dude, wouldn't it be fucking cool if Obi-Wan re-encountered Vader and learned just how

01:00:46.180 --> 01:00:47.180
much of a monster he's become?

01:00:47.180 --> 01:00:48.400
Yeah, it would be.

01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:50.480
But you need a narrative that supports that journey.

01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:54.380
You need a well-crafted story that will pick Obi-Wan up out of the desert where we left

01:00:54.380 --> 01:00:58.300
him at the end of Episode 3, have that cool scene in a way that doesn't break the lore,

01:00:58.300 --> 01:01:01.140
and then put him back down where he is in time for Episode 4.

01:01:01.140 --> 01:01:02.140
And this show?

01:01:02.140 --> 01:01:03.300
This show ain't that.

01:01:03.300 --> 01:01:07.140
That's why so many things happen at the end, for absolutely no reason at all, other than

01:01:07.140 --> 01:01:10.460
the fact that we need to reset the game board in time for a new hope.

01:01:10.460 --> 01:01:12.140
Obi-Wan has Vader beaten here.

01:01:12.140 --> 01:01:13.860
It's over, and he just walks away.

01:01:13.860 --> 01:01:14.860
Why?

01:01:14.860 --> 01:01:15.860
Why are you leaving?

01:01:15.860 --> 01:01:19.680
You even admit that Anakin is dead to you now, so why not make him actually dead?

01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:24.700
At this point, Obi-Wan knows he's seen what kind of monster Vader is, and he still lets

01:01:24.700 --> 01:01:25.700
him live.

01:01:25.700 --> 01:01:28.060
To go on to, for example, blow up Alderaan.

01:01:28.060 --> 01:01:29.940
Yeah, Obi-Wan, those millions of voices?

01:01:29.940 --> 01:01:31.420
That's your fault now, buddy.

01:01:31.420 --> 01:01:34.820
You just fucked up the homeworld of that little girl you apparently have a special bond with.

01:01:34.820 --> 01:01:35.860
But that's okay, right?

01:01:35.860 --> 01:01:39.060
Now you would think that we would end the show on the resolution of the most important

01:01:39.060 --> 01:01:40.060
arc.

01:01:40.060 --> 01:01:41.060
But no.

01:01:41.060 --> 01:01:44.380
After Vader is beaten, Riva is still playing grab-ass in the desert with Luke.

01:01:44.380 --> 01:01:45.860
Your father's lightsaber.

01:01:45.860 --> 01:01:47.540
Yeah, I know.

01:01:47.540 --> 01:01:51.100
Riva attacked my house ten years ago while you were off on an adventure with my sister.

01:01:51.100 --> 01:01:52.820
Luke falls or something and gets knocked out.

01:01:52.820 --> 01:01:53.820
I don't know.

01:01:53.820 --> 01:01:56.620
I'm writing this part of the script at like 3am and I can't be arsed to go back and

01:01:56.620 --> 01:01:57.620
check.

01:01:58.180 --> 01:01:59.540
Riva is only able to catch up and get her revenge.

01:01:59.540 --> 01:02:00.540
But she can't.

01:02:00.540 --> 01:02:02.860
She sees herself in Luke and she just can't do it.

01:02:02.860 --> 01:02:04.700
This is why everyone loves Riva, you guys.

01:02:04.700 --> 01:02:05.700
She's just confused.

01:02:05.700 --> 01:02:08.340
She's redeemed because she didn't kill the plot armor character.

01:02:08.340 --> 01:02:10.140
And that is a load of horseshit.

01:02:10.140 --> 01:02:12.540
What about all the other people Riva has killed?

01:02:12.540 --> 01:02:14.700
What about all the other shit she's done over the years?

01:02:14.700 --> 01:02:16.980
What about one-armed Sally back in Mos Eisley?

01:02:16.980 --> 01:02:19.100
You think she's ever going to be able to masturbate normally again?

01:02:19.100 --> 01:02:22.580
Doesn't she have some kind of moral consideration too, even though she's not a main character?

01:02:22.580 --> 01:02:23.760
Hell, what about Leia?

01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:27.680
Why wasn't she having PTSD flashbacks preventing her from torturing Leia?

01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:30.320
It was only getting called away that stopped her in the end.

01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:33.320
Did she just critically fail her willpower role when it came to Luke?

01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:36.900
Here's what people don't seem to understand nowadays about a good redemption arc.

01:02:36.900 --> 01:02:40.980
If Darth Vader had survived the Empire's fall, he would have been put on trial for

01:02:40.980 --> 01:02:43.320
war crimes, regardless of his redemption.

01:02:43.320 --> 01:02:47.560
Now if he's actually redeemed, he also would have accepted that fate and gone to his death

01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:48.560
peacefully.

01:02:48.560 --> 01:02:52.240
But the point is, suddenly saying, I'm the good guy now, even if you mean it, doesn't

01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:53.480
absolve you of what you did.

01:02:53.480 --> 01:02:56.280
That's the beginning point of the journey, not the end.

01:02:56.280 --> 01:03:00.320
So when Riva walks back to the Owen family home, carrying an unconscious Luke, Obi-Wan

01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:03.300
â€“ yeah, he made it back to Tatooine just in time for the action, the Star Destroyer

01:03:03.300 --> 01:03:06.440
in orbit gave him no trouble because of course it didn't â€“ Obi-Wan should immediately

01:03:06.440 --> 01:03:10.240
stick his lightsaber to her forehead and turn it on, but he doesn't because she's redeemed

01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:11.780
and she made the right choice.

01:03:11.780 --> 01:03:15.480
And because, I'm guessing, Disney's hoping to parlay this appearance into a Riva spin-off

01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:16.480
show.

01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:19.240
The obligatory reset button scene pretends it's a character moment, but it's not.

01:03:19.240 --> 01:03:22.320
It's here to restore the status quo and not disrupt the lore.

01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:25.780
Though considering all the plot holes that is bitched about for over an hour, there's

01:03:25.780 --> 01:03:29.160
no way one scene will repair all the damage the show has caused.

01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:45.900
But here is their attempt.

01:03:45.900 --> 01:03:49.580
Even though it's already common knowledge, among the many stormtroopers and inquisitors

01:03:49.580 --> 01:03:53.540
who saw it, the story ends with Obi-Wan deciding to move on with his life.

01:03:53.540 --> 01:03:57.540
Even though we all know that moving on means from moving from a Tatooine cave to a Tatooine

01:03:57.540 --> 01:03:58.540
hut.

01:03:58.540 --> 01:04:02.340
Moreover, at this point he should be the most wanted fucking Jedi in the galaxy now that

01:04:02.340 --> 01:04:06.300
it's confirmed he's still alive, having been a Jedi Master, a General of the Old Republic,

01:04:06.300 --> 01:04:09.420
his knowledge and dealings with the Rebel Alliance, his knowledge of Darth Vader's

01:04:09.420 --> 01:04:13.340
true identity, the fact that he managed to humiliate Vader in single combat again.

01:04:13.340 --> 01:04:16.360
His cover is entirely blown, but hey, it's okay.

01:04:16.360 --> 01:04:20.460
As part of the reset button, Vader tells the Emperor he's not going to pursue Obi-Wan,

01:04:20.460 --> 01:04:23.440
even though that goes against literally everything established about him.

01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:26.660
This is Ian McDiamond, whatever his name is, his one scene in the show.

01:04:26.660 --> 01:04:32.620
I bet he literally phoned his lines in over at Discord.

01:04:32.620 --> 01:04:33.620
No!

01:04:33.620 --> 01:04:37.340
These events have proven that Luke desperately needs you around, Obi-Wan.

01:04:37.340 --> 01:04:42.180
There are Imperial files somewhere that link you to Bail Organa and his daughter, and then

01:04:42.180 --> 01:04:46.820
you dropped a top secret message linking Bail Organa to the young boy in Uncle Owen's

01:04:46.820 --> 01:04:47.820
care.

01:04:47.820 --> 01:04:51.160
Now, the audience knows that Riva got a hold of the message and nobody else, but you don't

01:04:51.160 --> 01:04:52.220
know that, Obi-Wan.

01:04:52.220 --> 01:04:56.260
From your point of view, there's a trail of breadcrumbs out there leading Vader to

01:04:56.260 --> 01:04:58.480
Luke, just waiting for somebody to stumble upon it.

01:04:58.480 --> 01:05:02.880
And Obi-Wan is too fucking stupid to even recognize that it's the case.

01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:05.180
But that's okay, because you know who's equally stupid?

01:05:05.180 --> 01:05:06.340
Darth Vader himself.

01:05:13.180 --> 01:05:18.140
So, Darth Vader is a retard, and it's not solely because of the Obi-Wan Kenobi show,

01:05:18.140 --> 01:05:22.460
but that does give us the final puzzle pieces that allow us to definitively declare him

01:05:22.460 --> 01:05:23.460
retarded.

01:05:23.460 --> 01:05:27.380
Like I said earlier, Leia's association with Obi-Wan should mean that a Star Destroyer

01:05:27.380 --> 01:05:30.580
should immediately land on the Organa family house.

01:05:30.580 --> 01:05:34.300
Riva told the Grand Inquisitor that there was a connection between Obi-Wan and Bail

01:05:34.300 --> 01:05:35.300
in the archives.

01:05:35.300 --> 01:05:37.900
The Grand Inquisitor has witnessed the result of that connection.

01:05:37.900 --> 01:05:39.100
Obi-Wan came out of hiding.

01:05:39.100 --> 01:05:42.860
Yeah, Vader told the Emperor he wasn't going to obsess over Obi-Wan, which is this show's

01:05:42.860 --> 01:05:45.020
hackneyed way of tying up the loose end.

01:05:45.020 --> 01:05:49.040
But even with catching Obi-Wan off the table, surely the Grand Inquisitor is smart enough

01:05:49.040 --> 01:05:54.700
to think, hmm, maybe I should go down to the Imperial archives myself and retrace Riva's

01:05:54.700 --> 01:05:55.700
steps.

01:05:55.700 --> 01:05:59.620
Not to find Kenobi himself, but maybe to find Bail's connection to him and the Rebels.

01:05:59.620 --> 01:06:03.540
Even without Bail's incriminating message, Riva left the rest of the Imperial characters

01:06:03.540 --> 01:06:04.880
enough clues to begin a hunt.

01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:09.040
We know that Darth Vader doesn't learn that Luke is his son until the middle of Empire

01:06:09.040 --> 01:06:10.040
Strikes Back.

01:06:10.040 --> 01:06:34.220
George Lucas added this scene in one of the 50 remastered editions.

01:06:34.340 --> 01:06:46.020
The original also informs him of the news, in a more roundabout way.

01:06:46.020 --> 01:06:50.780
Bail Organa, Yoda, and Obi-Wan plotted at the end of Episode III to hide the children

01:06:50.780 --> 01:06:51.780
away.

01:07:04.220 --> 01:07:16.220
Yeah, we've already talked about how the Sith won't sense the Maximination is kind

01:07:16.220 --> 01:07:19.260
of shit, considering the job that Leia is being groomed into.

01:07:19.260 --> 01:07:21.540
God, I hate that that word's been ruined.

01:07:21.540 --> 01:07:24.300
This is actually how you're supposed to use it, that you groom a person for leadership

01:07:24.300 --> 01:07:25.300
at a young age.

01:07:25.300 --> 01:07:27.460
Get your minds out of the gutter, you weirdos.

01:07:27.460 --> 01:07:29.460
Vader knows he has family on Tatooine.

01:07:29.460 --> 01:07:33.820
He and Padme visited them in Episode II, where Owen and Beru have Ani's old protocol droids,

01:07:33.820 --> 01:07:35.460
C-3PO, which they take with them.

01:07:35.460 --> 01:07:40.180
And then Uncle Owen buys back the same protocol droid 20 years later, without recognizing

01:07:40.180 --> 01:07:41.180
him.

01:07:41.180 --> 01:07:42.180
Geez.

01:07:42.180 --> 01:07:43.180
Maybe Owen always was an idiot.

01:07:43.180 --> 01:07:47.020
Yeah, stolen from me.

01:07:47.020 --> 01:07:50.060
But they drop off Luke with these people, whom Vader already knows about.

01:07:50.060 --> 01:07:52.640
And they don't even bother to change his fucking name?

01:07:52.640 --> 01:07:54.820
Why does he call himself Luke Skywalker?

01:07:54.820 --> 01:07:57.740
Why wouldn't it be Luke Lars to keep up the charade?

01:07:57.740 --> 01:08:02.580
You know that it's supposed to be public record, that Padme lost her twins when she died, right?

01:08:02.580 --> 01:08:05.200
That's why she's made to look pregnant during her funeral?

01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:06.700
Because they were faking this shit?

01:08:06.700 --> 01:08:08.660
Why did they keep that last name for Luke?

01:08:08.660 --> 01:08:09.660
Okay, fine.

01:08:09.660 --> 01:08:10.660
He's Luke Skywalker.

01:08:10.660 --> 01:08:14.960
Somehow, word didn't get back to the Empire that, on the moisture farm where Vader knows

01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:19.700
he has family, there's a young boy who looks and acts like him named Luke Skywalker.

01:08:19.700 --> 01:08:20.700
Alright.

01:08:20.700 --> 01:08:23.900
When the hunt for the Death Star plans in A New Hope brings Vader back to Tatooine,

01:08:23.900 --> 01:08:26.380
do you think he's ever looking out the window and thinking like,

01:08:26.380 --> 01:08:29.440
Hmm, I wonder how Owen and Beru are doing down there?

01:08:29.440 --> 01:08:31.620
And then the search goes forward like we see in the movie.

01:08:31.620 --> 01:08:33.460
Later Stormtroopers find the escape pod.

01:08:33.460 --> 01:08:35.220
They find evidence that there's droids.

01:08:35.220 --> 01:08:37.460
They follow the droid tracks to Jawa tracks.

01:08:37.460 --> 01:08:40.500
They catch up with the Jawas, torture them for information on who bought the droids,

01:08:40.500 --> 01:08:43.240
and then kill them, making it look like it was a Sand People attack.

01:08:43.240 --> 01:08:47.220
The information leads them to the Lars farm, where they fucking disintegrate Uncle Owen

01:08:47.220 --> 01:08:48.220
and Aunt Beru.

01:08:48.220 --> 01:08:51.700
How in the hell do you think that conversation went back on the Star Destroyer?

01:08:51.700 --> 01:08:53.420
So how did it go down there?

01:08:53.420 --> 01:08:56.980
Well the droids were sold to a moisture farmer named Owen Lars, but the trail ran cold.

01:08:56.980 --> 01:08:59.020
Oh, that's a funny coincidence.

01:08:59.020 --> 01:09:04.580
Yeah don't worry though, we killed him to keep it a secret.

01:09:04.580 --> 01:09:06.380
The Stormtroopers are looking for droids, right?

01:09:06.380 --> 01:09:11.340
So maybe after torching the Lars family, the smart thing to do is to ransack the farm looking

01:09:11.340 --> 01:09:14.140
for the droids or maybe any other information that might help.

01:09:14.140 --> 01:09:17.380
Maybe the Stormtroopers find evidence that there's actually a third member of the family,

01:09:17.380 --> 01:09:21.620
like say a teenage boy, another bedroom, a third bed, a smaller set of clothes, maybe

01:09:21.620 --> 01:09:24.260
a toy or two that it turns out Obi-Wan gave him.

01:09:24.260 --> 01:09:28.140
Maybe they find paperwork or evidence that this boy's name is Luke fucking Skywalker.

01:09:28.140 --> 01:09:32.260
Maybe before Owen and Beru die they say that the droids aren't here right now, that their

01:09:32.260 --> 01:09:37.380
son Luke fucking Skywalker is taking them to get maintenance in Anchorhead or something.

01:09:37.380 --> 01:09:40.580
Surely this news gets back to Vader eventually in a mission report or something.

01:09:40.580 --> 01:09:45.020
You'd think he'd be interested in this mysterious new young relative of his who has gone missing

01:09:45.020 --> 01:09:46.540
with the plans of the Death Star.

01:09:46.540 --> 01:09:49.180
You'd think that when the Rebels attack the Death Star at the end of the movie and the

01:09:49.180 --> 01:09:53.700
Imperials figure out that they use the plans to find a weakness, and then Vader notices

01:09:53.700 --> 01:09:57.660
the pilot who eventually hits the bullseye.

01:09:57.700 --> 01:10:00.220
You think he might put two and two together?

01:10:00.220 --> 01:10:01.860
TIE fighters can't go faster than light.

01:10:01.860 --> 01:10:02.860
They're support craft.

01:10:02.860 --> 01:10:05.780
Vader's got several decades to mull it over on his way home.

01:10:05.780 --> 01:10:07.380
Okay, put it together buddy.

01:10:07.380 --> 01:10:10.060
Who do you think that this young hotshot Rebel pilot could be?

01:10:10.060 --> 01:10:13.720
It doesn't matter though, because if the Rebellion was smart, they'd double back and pick his

01:10:13.720 --> 01:10:14.900
lonesome ass off.

01:10:14.900 --> 01:10:20.900
You should have killed me when you had the chance, sister.

01:10:20.900 --> 01:10:27.100
Oh, so you have a twin sister.

01:10:27.100 --> 01:10:30.940
Your feelings have now betrayed her too.

01:10:30.940 --> 01:10:34.300
Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from me.

01:10:34.300 --> 01:10:36.500
And surely you should have put this one together too?

01:10:36.500 --> 01:10:39.100
Vader, who was it that Riva illegally kidnapped?

01:10:39.100 --> 01:10:41.140
Did the Grand Inquisitor just not tell you?

01:10:41.140 --> 01:10:45.100
Did no one look at the records of the holding cell, the interrogation room, whatever?

01:10:45.100 --> 01:10:49.460
There may be motivation to keep Obi-Wan's involvement a secret, but not to keep Leia's

01:10:49.460 --> 01:10:50.460
kidnapping.

01:10:51.020 --> 01:10:53.900
If the Lord would have gotten back to Vader eventually, Anakin really is retarded that

01:10:53.900 --> 01:10:55.260
he didn't figure all this stuff out.

01:10:55.260 --> 01:10:58.020
You know, I'm starting to think that Star Wars was always stupid.

01:10:58.020 --> 01:11:01.000
And I guess in that sense, the Obi-Wan Kenobi show fits right in.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.740
This is the quintessential cool scene-itis show.

01:11:03.740 --> 01:11:06.860
It's so formulaic, it feels like it was written by an algorithm.

01:11:06.860 --> 01:11:08.020
And here's what I mean by that.

01:11:08.020 --> 01:11:11.940
George Lucas set it up at the end of Revenge of the Sith, such that all the pieces are

01:11:11.940 --> 01:11:13.620
in place for Episode IV to begin.

01:11:13.620 --> 01:11:14.740
Yoda's on Dagobah.

01:11:14.740 --> 01:11:15.940
Bail adopts Leia.

01:11:15.940 --> 01:11:17.260
Uncle Owen adopts Luke.

01:11:17.260 --> 01:11:19.940
C-3PO's memory is wiped to protect Leia's identity.

01:11:19.940 --> 01:11:23.900
But R2-D2's isn't, making him a colossal asshole who could have told anybody everything

01:11:23.900 --> 01:11:25.560
at any time and he just didn't.

01:11:25.560 --> 01:11:30.460
So an Obi-Wan Kenobi show taking place in Episodes III and IV has to do a few things.

01:11:30.460 --> 01:11:33.020
Firstly, it can't majorly disrupt the lore.

01:11:33.020 --> 01:11:36.100
Whatever happens during the show, we have to end up back where we started, with the

01:11:36.100 --> 01:11:38.120
pieces still in place for Episode IV.

01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:39.960
Which means you have two options.

01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:43.600
Option A, it's a tiny character piece exploring Obi-Wan and his solitude.

01:11:43.600 --> 01:11:48.320
Option B, anything done that could mess up the lore, if left unresolved, has to be resolved

01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:50.600
such that the integrity of the story is maintained.

01:11:50.600 --> 01:11:54.440
Secondly, it can't betray the characterization of the people that the audience cares about.

01:11:54.440 --> 01:11:57.900
There's a natural midpoint between who these people are in Episode III and who they become

01:11:57.900 --> 01:12:01.160
in Episode IV, and that can be a very precise target to hit.

01:12:01.160 --> 01:12:04.360
In other words, it has to respect the story and it has to respect the characters.

01:12:04.360 --> 01:12:07.080
Does Obi-Wan Kenobi do either of these things?

01:12:07.080 --> 01:12:08.320
Let's start with the characters.

01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:09.840
Obi-Wan is pretty much spot on.

01:12:09.840 --> 01:12:12.080
Uncle Owen's conflict with him is only natural.

01:12:12.080 --> 01:12:14.960
Leia seems about correct even though her actress isn't great.

01:12:14.960 --> 01:12:15.960
Vader?

01:12:15.960 --> 01:12:17.000
I don't know about this one.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:20.840
People tend to forget how tame Vader was in A New Hope, he was always a Saturday morning

01:12:20.840 --> 01:12:21.840
cartoon villain.

01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:22.840
We meet again at last.

01:12:22.840 --> 01:12:23.840
The circle is now complete.

01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:31.040
When I left you I was but the learner, now I am the master.

01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:35.940
I think that's why, when fans recreated the Vader-Obi-Wan fight from Episode IV, to make

01:12:35.940 --> 01:12:40.640
it more line up with their physical abilities from Episode III, they also made Vader a lot

01:12:40.640 --> 01:12:41.640
angrier.

01:12:41.640 --> 01:12:43.280
Okay, how about the plot then?

01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:47.500
Well, you just listened to my over an hour long epic rant on how this one's an obvious

01:12:47.500 --> 01:12:48.500
NO.

01:12:48.500 --> 01:12:51.400
I don't think I've ever written anything this detailed for my channel in my entire

01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:52.400
life.

01:12:52.400 --> 01:12:54.680
This show has almost an infinite number of problems.

01:12:54.680 --> 01:12:57.600
Firstly, it can't choose what kind of story it wants to be.

01:12:57.600 --> 01:13:01.020
A tiny character piece or an epic adventure with a big reset button.

01:13:01.020 --> 01:13:02.360
So it tries to do both.

01:13:02.360 --> 01:13:05.880
One A and one B. The first episode, showing Obi-Wan's depression and the state of his

01:13:05.880 --> 01:13:06.880
life.

01:13:06.880 --> 01:13:07.880
That shit is great.

01:13:07.880 --> 01:13:10.160
I know some fanboys were complaining that they made Obi-Wan a cuck, but I don't care.

01:13:10.160 --> 01:13:11.160
It was good.

01:13:11.160 --> 01:13:13.760
That's exactly what you should do if you're making this kind of show.

01:13:13.760 --> 01:13:18.080
Obi-Wan's lost, he's defeated, and billions of people are now suffering because he failed.

01:13:18.080 --> 01:13:22.080
He should be a scarred character, and the triumphant hero story of how he gets his mojo

01:13:22.080 --> 01:13:24.440
back, that is exactly what this narrative needs.

01:13:24.440 --> 01:13:26.440
This series also answers another question.

01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:29.040
Why Obi-Wan doesn't think that Vader can be redeemed.

01:13:29.040 --> 01:13:31.360
There is still good in him.

01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:34.120
He's more machine now than man.

01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:36.360
Twisted and evil.

01:13:36.360 --> 01:13:39.680
I mean, you can kind of imply it from the prequels, but at least here it's spelled

01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:40.680
out explicitly.

01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:44.560
Also, they kind of shoehorn in him, calling Anakin, Darth.

01:13:44.560 --> 01:13:48.880
Goodbye, Darth.

01:13:48.880 --> 01:13:50.840
Which I don't know, it doesn't really work, but fine.

01:13:50.840 --> 01:13:55.560
But all the character stuff from one A suffers from all the rebellion stuff from one B, and

01:13:55.560 --> 01:13:57.800
that's all just pure garbage.

01:13:57.800 --> 01:13:59.280
None of those characters are likable.

01:13:59.280 --> 01:14:02.840
None of them matter in the long run, except Leia, and she necessarily has plot armor the

01:14:02.840 --> 01:14:03.840
whole show.

01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:05.360
How many plot holes are there in this story?

01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:06.740
How many unnecessary arcs?

01:14:06.740 --> 01:14:08.040
How many unnecessary scenes?

01:14:08.040 --> 01:14:10.400
How many lines of dialogue that just make no sense?

01:14:10.400 --> 01:14:12.440
I'm sorry, but that's not my problem.

01:14:12.440 --> 01:14:15.360
Look, if you want my help, you got it.

01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:19.640
Soon the location of the network and Kenobi will be ours.

01:14:19.640 --> 01:14:21.360
Kenobi is all that matters.

01:14:21.360 --> 01:14:22.800
You're in, die, you know.

01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:24.520
All signals in or out are blocked.

01:14:24.520 --> 01:14:26.400
I let your parents know you're safe.

01:14:26.400 --> 01:14:31.240
I know he said no communication, but your silence worries me.

01:14:31.240 --> 01:14:35.040
I am what you made me.

01:14:35.040 --> 01:14:38.440
I am not your failure, Obi-Wan.

01:14:38.480 --> 01:14:43.480
No matter whether he dies or I do, this ends today.

01:14:43.480 --> 01:14:48.280
Goodbye, Darth.

01:14:48.280 --> 01:14:55.520
But there's always a teacher, someone who mentors the young hero in what his destiny

01:14:55.520 --> 01:14:56.520
is.

01:14:56.520 --> 01:15:02.320
And in this case, it's an old Jedi who has been sitting out in the desert primarily waiting

01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:04.320
for this moment to happen.

01:15:04.320 --> 01:15:14.320
He served me well during the Clone Wars and has lived in hiding since the Emperor's Purge.

01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:16.200
Yes, I will send for him.

01:15:16.200 --> 01:15:17.200
One last fight.

01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:20.840
He's been sitting out in the desert primarily waiting for this moment to happen.

01:15:20.840 --> 01:15:23.940
He's lived in hiding since the Emperor's Purge.

01:15:23.940 --> 01:15:25.920
One last fight.

01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:30.000
Also, if you're telling a story and you want the audience to care, the rules have to be

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:31.840
at least somewhat consistent.

01:15:31.840 --> 01:15:36.080
If Darth Vader can extinguish flames at the Force or pull a starship down from takeoff,

01:15:36.080 --> 01:15:39.000
you can't just have him not be able to do it a second later.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.820
There has to be a consistent idea of what the stakes are.

01:15:41.820 --> 01:15:45.940
If people keep surviving gut-stabbings, no matter how many fucking stomachs they have,

01:15:45.940 --> 01:15:50.120
the audience's reaction to a scene like this isn't, oh my god, he's dead, it's, I wonder

01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:51.280
if they'll bring him back or not.

01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:55.140
If anything, the moral lesson of Star Wars is at this point, when you kill somebody,

01:15:55.140 --> 01:15:57.160
make sure to actually fucking finish the job.

01:15:57.160 --> 01:16:01.560
The Grand Inquisitor comes back, Darth Maul's come back now, Riva came back twice.

01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:07.240
There's also just a bunch of small things that bug me about Kenobi too.

01:16:07.240 --> 01:16:09.960
Yeah, the quality is all over the place like I mentioned at the start of the video.

01:16:09.960 --> 01:16:12.080
But also, Vader looks weird in this show.

01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:16.360
I know it's not just Hayden Christensen's scrawny ass in that suit, but still, something's

01:16:16.360 --> 01:16:17.360
off.

01:16:17.360 --> 01:16:20.320
They keep showing him in these wide shots far away from everyone else, so no one's making

01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:21.820
any comparisons about his size.

01:16:21.820 --> 01:16:23.440
Look at the Riva Force choke scene.

01:16:23.440 --> 01:16:27.120
Riva is clearly his height, except when he gets closer and then it's like, whoops, he's

01:16:27.120 --> 01:16:28.800
suddenly two feet taller than her.

01:16:28.800 --> 01:16:30.840
It's not just the visuals though, it's the writing too.

01:16:30.840 --> 01:16:34.440
Riva's got like three scenes setting up her storyline in the first episode.

01:16:34.440 --> 01:16:36.200
Leia goes running through the woods twice.

01:16:36.200 --> 01:16:38.400
We've got three days at Obi-Wan's dreary job.

01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:41.400
And it's not just establishing scenes that repeat.

01:16:41.400 --> 01:16:44.220
How many times did Obi-Wan have private conversations in public?

01:16:44.220 --> 01:16:46.360
Or how many times did he try to sacrifice himself?

01:16:46.360 --> 01:16:49.560
Hell, the entirety of Episode 4 is just filler.

01:16:49.560 --> 01:16:50.560
Think about it.

01:16:50.560 --> 01:16:55.240
The total arc of the show is, Leia's kidnapped, Obi-Wan goes to help, he rescues Leia on Daewoo,

01:16:55.240 --> 01:16:59.000
he has to get smuggled by the Rebels off-world to some mining planet, I still don't know

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:02.000
the name, I still don't care to look it up, where the Empire catches up and Obi-Wan has

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:03.960
to confront Vader, the Ghost from his past.

01:17:03.960 --> 01:17:06.720
Obi-Wan loses that fight, this is the low point of the story.

01:17:06.720 --> 01:17:11.380
Leia's kidnapped a second time, Obi-Wan rescues her again, they go to the Rebel base on Jabiim,

01:17:11.380 --> 01:17:15.580
the Empire lays siege to it, the Rebels escape just in time, Obi-Wan has his second showdown

01:17:15.580 --> 01:17:16.580
and wins.

01:17:16.580 --> 01:17:21.100
You can cut out the Leia re-kidnap and re-rescue bit from Episode 4 entirely and the story

01:17:21.100 --> 01:17:22.360
is completely fine.

01:17:22.360 --> 01:17:26.400
In fact, it's better because the lore-breaking scene where Leia reveals to agents of the

01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:29.600
Empire that she knows Obi-Wan is cut out along with that arc.

01:17:29.600 --> 01:17:34.160
In prep for this video, I think I've watched this show about 4 times now, God rest my soul,

01:17:34.160 --> 01:17:39.040
and I've really begun to notice just how many times micro-arcs repeat only to pad out the

01:17:39.040 --> 01:17:40.880
runtime of what should have been a movie.

01:17:40.880 --> 01:17:44.840
We know that this story was originally supposed to be a movie, Kenobi the Balance of the Force.

01:17:44.840 --> 01:17:48.920
Disney sees the writing on the wall when it comes to TV shows and miniseries versus movies,

01:17:48.920 --> 01:17:53.040
especially after the success of The Mandalorian versus the failure of Solo A Star Wars Story.

01:17:53.040 --> 01:17:56.840
So they took their script for Kenobi A Star Wars Story and stretched it out to Kenobi

01:17:56.840 --> 01:17:58.040
A 6 Episode Story.

01:17:58.040 --> 01:18:01.600
In fact, several people have already re-cut it into a movie and as a movie it actually

01:18:01.600 --> 01:18:02.600
works pretty well.

01:18:02.600 --> 01:18:05.880
I mean it's not perfect, but if you only use the footage and the plot on hand, you

01:18:05.880 --> 01:18:08.360
can actually make an okay feature film out of this.

01:18:08.360 --> 01:18:11.360
It still doesn't hold a candle to the Kenobi fan film though, which basically does the

01:18:11.360 --> 01:18:14.940
quiet Tatooine character story and does it 10,000 times better.

01:18:14.940 --> 01:18:16.200
It's all the same beats.

01:18:16.200 --> 01:18:19.720
Obi-Wan is old and downtrodden, he's losing his connection to the Force, Uncle Owen wants

01:18:19.720 --> 01:18:22.540
him to go away, and by the end Obi-Wan gets his mojo back.

01:18:22.540 --> 01:18:24.140
But it's actually legitimately good.

01:18:24.140 --> 01:18:27.580
The fans really do understand Star Wars in a way that Disney doesn't.

01:18:27.580 --> 01:18:31.780
At this point, it's obvious to me just how much of Kenobi is a repeat of something we've

01:18:31.780 --> 01:18:32.780
seen before.

01:18:32.780 --> 01:18:37.060
Yeah, they repeat scenes, or they repeat whole arcs even just to fill the hour, but it's

01:18:37.060 --> 01:18:38.420
not only that.

01:18:38.420 --> 01:18:42.180
Pretty much everything noteworthy from this show is taken from something else.

01:18:42.180 --> 01:18:45.100
This part's from the fan film, this part's from Return of the Jedi, this part's from

01:18:45.100 --> 01:18:47.220
the video game, this part's from Rogue One.

01:18:47.220 --> 01:18:54.700
And the linchpin moment of the show has already been done before, in Rebels with Ahsoka Tano.

01:18:54.700 --> 01:18:58.580
I know, I know, it's just a TV show, stop caring Dev, why can't you just shut your

01:18:58.580 --> 01:19:02.220
brain off and let the images enter through your eyes and have a mildly entertaining evening?

01:19:02.220 --> 01:19:05.940
I understand that point of view, and there is some value in just liking something for

01:19:05.940 --> 01:19:07.740
the spectacle, even if it is dumb.

01:19:07.740 --> 01:19:13.160
But that has to be a choice that you as the viewer make, not they as the creator insist

01:19:13.160 --> 01:19:14.160
that you choose.

01:19:14.160 --> 01:19:17.060
Okay, here's a good example, this happened back in 2015.

01:19:17.060 --> 01:19:18.740
Back when the video game Fallout 4 came out.

01:19:18.740 --> 01:19:21.500
If you don't know anything about Fallout, here's the quick TLDR.

01:19:21.500 --> 01:19:25.440
Nuclear war happens, Americans take shelter in vaults built by the Vault-Tec Corporation.

01:19:25.440 --> 01:19:29.140
Some of the vaults turn out to be weird social experiments set up to study human behavior.

01:19:29.140 --> 01:19:33.060
Vault 95 was housed with only drug addicts, and there were no drugs in the vault.

01:19:33.060 --> 01:19:37.240
Except, five years in, a massive stash of drugs would be revealed in a hidden location

01:19:37.240 --> 01:19:38.240
in the vault.

01:19:38.240 --> 01:19:41.480
The problem is, one of the logs the player can find is written by a delivery man, where

01:19:41.480 --> 01:19:43.620
he says that he's delivering a shipment of Jet.

01:19:43.620 --> 01:19:47.260
Jet is a fictional drug in Fallout, it's a weird cross between meth and jankum made

01:19:47.260 --> 01:19:49.980
from the fumes of dung from irradiated cattle.

01:19:49.980 --> 01:19:53.700
Jet was invented after the bombs dropped, so there was no way that a pre-war delivery

01:19:53.700 --> 01:19:56.100
man was bringing a shipment to Vault 95.

01:19:56.100 --> 01:19:59.020
Now this is a problem that's very easy to fix, especially in a video game.

01:19:59.020 --> 01:20:02.660
You just say, oh sorry guys, my mistake, and then in the next patch just change the text

01:20:02.660 --> 01:20:03.660
of the log.

01:20:03.660 --> 01:20:04.660
One and done, right?

01:20:04.660 --> 01:20:05.660
But that's not what happened.

01:20:05.660 --> 01:20:10.020
The writer of that quest, Pete Hines, when the inconsistency went viral on Twitter, replied

01:20:10.020 --> 01:20:14.160
with saying, doesn't say what year that was posted, implying that after the bombs

01:20:14.160 --> 01:20:18.820
had dropped and Jet had been invented, Vault-Tec was somehow still around and still sending

01:20:18.820 --> 01:20:21.140
out trucks of drugs to Vault 95.

01:20:21.140 --> 01:20:25.380
When the fan pointed out the obvious flaw in that logic, as well as other consistency

01:20:25.380 --> 01:20:30.060
problems, Pete Hines gave this response, not interested in discussing how realistic things

01:20:30.060 --> 01:20:34.780
are in an alternate universe post-apocalyptic game with talking mutants and ghouls.

01:20:34.780 --> 01:20:39.480
And of course, various game and tech-based news outlets backed him up, making fun of

01:20:39.480 --> 01:20:45.240
fans who dared to complain about lore inconsistencies because of not taking the series seriously

01:20:45.240 --> 01:20:49.960
enough that features aliens, a talking tree, invincible children, and guns that fire miniature

01:20:49.960 --> 01:20:50.960
nuclear warheads.

01:20:50.960 --> 01:20:54.840
And it's like, on some level, yeah, that actually makes sense.

01:20:54.840 --> 01:20:56.200
It is just a story.

01:20:56.200 --> 01:20:57.320
It's just a fictional world.

01:20:57.320 --> 01:21:01.320
So if the new writers working on it make a mistake, on some level, you shouldn't take

01:21:01.320 --> 01:21:02.460
it too seriously.

01:21:02.460 --> 01:21:06.780
But the flip side of that, as part of not taking it seriously, is no longer consuming

01:21:06.780 --> 01:21:07.780
it.

01:21:07.780 --> 01:21:10.860
The game is created by Interplay, though the games are now made by Bethesda, which

01:21:10.860 --> 01:21:13.420
is a whole other rabbit hole not worth going down for this video.

01:21:13.420 --> 01:21:17.260
The point is, Bethesda is not the creator of Fallout, they're only its current owners.

01:21:17.260 --> 01:21:20.660
The people who work at Bethesda might care to a point, but if push comes to shove, they

01:21:20.660 --> 01:21:22.620
prioritize their own vision.

01:21:22.620 --> 01:21:25.780
And stuff like this is ultimately how they view it.

01:21:25.780 --> 01:21:29.440
Because while if you're a fan of Fallout, it means something to you, that's why you

01:21:29.440 --> 01:21:33.200
enjoy it, that's why you're the superfan, but to them, it's only a vehicle for their

01:21:33.200 --> 01:21:34.200
new story.

01:21:34.200 --> 01:21:39.000
If they can get away with not respecting old lore, not simply just to save face in a Twitter

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:43.440
fight, but also because the old lore gets in the way of the new story they want to tell,

01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:47.560
and they believe that you'll continue consuming the product, what incentive do they have to

01:21:47.560 --> 01:21:48.800
respect the old lore?

01:21:48.800 --> 01:21:53.040
And through that lens, we can understand why Pete Hines took it as a personal attack, that

01:21:53.040 --> 01:21:57.840
fans pointed out there was inconsistencies between his writing and what came before.

01:21:57.840 --> 01:22:01.040
Now how many times have you heard a story like this?

01:22:01.040 --> 01:22:02.040
How many video games?

01:22:02.040 --> 01:22:03.040
How many TV shows?

01:22:03.040 --> 01:22:04.040
How many movies?

01:22:04.880 --> 01:22:06.000
Something equivalent to this happened to.

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.560
People take these things seriously because they love them.

01:22:08.560 --> 01:22:12.680
When they see inconsistencies, they're worried that the new stewards don't actually care.

01:22:12.680 --> 01:22:16.300
And when those new stewards respond like this, it's a confirmation that they're really

01:22:16.300 --> 01:22:20.560
only here to wear the progressive skin suit of the thing that you love, to ignore pre-established

01:22:20.560 --> 01:22:23.040
storylines and push whatever it is they want to push.

01:22:23.040 --> 01:22:25.960
So apply this lens back to Star Wars, and what do you see?

01:22:25.960 --> 01:22:30.040
When I watched that final scene with Riva crying in the sand, I had a sinking feeling

01:22:30.040 --> 01:22:32.520
that this whole thing existed simply to set up her spin-off show.

01:22:32.680 --> 01:22:36.360
They were taking a beloved character, this guy in the title, and using him as the opening

01:22:36.360 --> 01:22:38.840
act for the story they actually wanted to tell.

01:22:38.840 --> 01:22:41.640
This is like bait-and-switch Member Berries, where you think you're getting the Member

01:22:41.640 --> 01:22:43.320
Berries you want and that's how they drag you in.

01:22:43.320 --> 01:22:44.320
But it was me, Riva!

01:22:44.320 --> 01:22:48.280
Jesus, we're this far into the video and I completely forgot to talk about the Qui-Gon

01:22:48.280 --> 01:22:49.280
scene.

01:22:49.280 --> 01:22:50.960
I actually forgot about it, it's that forgettable.

01:22:50.960 --> 01:22:52.920
I'm re-recording this days later.

01:22:52.920 --> 01:22:56.980
One of the big Member Berries scenes of Kenobi is in the very end, where Qui-Gon shows up

01:22:56.980 --> 01:23:01.360
as a Force ghost and basically says, get ready for season two, you fucking nerds.

01:23:01.400 --> 01:23:06.440
This scene serves no purpose whatsoever, other than to get fanboys to record reaction videos,

01:23:06.440 --> 01:23:09.000
like how they reacted to Luke at the end of Mando season two.

01:23:31.360 --> 01:23:47.520
A far better use of Qui-Gon would have been, in the scene where Obi-Wan is buried by rocks

01:23:47.520 --> 01:23:51.120
during the Vader fight, Qui-Gon whispers to him, it wasn't your fault.

01:23:51.120 --> 01:23:52.220
And that would have made sense.

01:23:52.220 --> 01:23:56.500
The whole story is, or should be, about Obi-Wan coming to grips with his guilt.

01:23:56.500 --> 01:24:00.360
In A Phantom Menace, Obi-Wan didn't want to train Anakin, Qui-Gon did.

01:24:00.360 --> 01:24:02.940
And Qui-Gon made Obi-Wan promise him to do it.

01:24:02.940 --> 01:24:07.260
The rock Berries scene would have been far superior with Qui-Gon in it, than with Obi-Wan

01:24:07.260 --> 01:24:11.640
fantasizing about kids, but it wouldn't have given us that reactable moment that Disney

01:24:11.640 --> 01:24:12.640
wanted.

01:24:12.640 --> 01:24:16.580
Yet again, they sacrificed the soul of the story for what looked cool.

01:24:16.580 --> 01:24:21.640
The reason people originally liked Star Wars is because, despite the many flaws of these

01:24:21.640 --> 01:24:24.160
movies, it had something to say about the human condition.

01:24:24.160 --> 01:24:27.980
It's not really about stormtroopers and death stars and X-wings and lightsabers.

01:24:27.980 --> 01:24:28.980
Those are the trappings.

01:24:28.980 --> 01:24:29.980
That's the window dressing.

01:24:30.020 --> 01:24:32.940
That's what you drape over top of what should be, a good solid story.

01:24:32.940 --> 01:24:36.020
George Lucas has correctly identified that A New Hope is more of a fantasy film than

01:24:36.020 --> 01:24:37.020
a sci-fi one.

01:24:37.020 --> 01:24:43.740
My original inspiration on this film was really to use mythological motifs to create a whole

01:24:43.740 --> 01:24:48.540
new kind of myth that was very updated and contemporary.

01:24:48.540 --> 01:24:54.800
So I used the Saturday matinee serial as my vessel to put this barrel of mythological

01:24:54.800 --> 01:24:56.300
motifs together.

01:24:56.340 --> 01:25:00.580
Since it's based on a very kind of old story and not a high-tech story, it's more of a

01:25:00.580 --> 01:25:05.020
fantasy film than a science fiction film, I was able to use archetypes which helped

01:25:05.020 --> 01:25:10.120
develop the characters and put them in a context where they could be easily grasped because

01:25:10.120 --> 01:25:11.940
they are traditional characters.

01:25:11.940 --> 01:25:18.260
And this is the same story that has been told a thousand times around the world for several

01:25:18.260 --> 01:25:19.620
thousand years.

01:25:19.620 --> 01:25:20.740
This is a mythic story.

01:25:20.740 --> 01:25:24.180
It models for us what it means to be a hero in a very generic sense.

01:25:24.380 --> 01:25:28.380
Luke Skywalker is a child of destiny given a magic sword by an old wizard and told to

01:25:28.380 --> 01:25:31.700
storm a fortress guarded by the Black Knight in order to rescue a princess.

01:25:31.700 --> 01:25:36.020
The scope and scale of the story, along with 4 1977 state-of-the-art effects, help cover

01:25:36.020 --> 01:25:39.100
up the fact that Star Wars is a very basic hero's journey.

01:25:39.100 --> 01:25:41.780
Meanwhile, The Empire Strikes Back turns us on its head.

01:25:41.780 --> 01:25:45.160
It's a story about how the hero deals with his own failure, how it's his own heroism

01:25:45.160 --> 01:25:48.980
that is the source of the failure, and how to come to grips with the terrible truth.

01:25:48.980 --> 01:25:51.460
Luke's heroic traits are well-defined in A New Hope.

01:25:51.460 --> 01:25:53.640
He's courageous, loyal, and impulsive.

01:25:53.640 --> 01:25:57.800
All qualities well-suited for a young man leaping to the defense of the helpless.

01:25:57.800 --> 01:26:01.880
But in Empire, these qualities lead him to a confrontation with Vader that he isn't

01:26:01.880 --> 01:26:04.320
ready for and he loses badly.

01:26:04.320 --> 01:26:07.280
Yoda tells him point blank before it even happens.

01:26:07.280 --> 01:26:13.920
If you end your training now, if you choose the quick and easy path as Vader did, you

01:26:13.920 --> 01:26:15.780
will become an agent of evil.

01:26:15.780 --> 01:26:19.520
But Luke has to experience it to truly understand the path that he's on.

01:26:19.520 --> 01:26:21.960
Return of the Jedi is the culmination of this story.

01:26:21.960 --> 01:26:25.480
Luke's first appearance in the movie, he's acting a little bit more Sith-like than the

01:26:25.480 --> 01:26:29.040
audience should be comfortable with, but at the same time, he's also more patient.

01:26:29.040 --> 01:26:33.740
He allows Jabba to make aggressive moves and mistakes while his own plan unfolds.

01:26:33.740 --> 01:26:36.380
This is what integrating your dark side looks like.

01:26:36.380 --> 01:26:39.040
By the end of the movie, Luke refuses to kill Vader.

01:26:39.040 --> 01:26:43.320
In fact, at the end of all three movies, Luke gives up control and takes a leap of faith.

01:26:43.320 --> 01:26:46.960
It's not a foregone conclusion that Vader will rescue him from the Emperor's forced

01:26:46.960 --> 01:26:47.960
lightning.

01:26:47.960 --> 01:26:51.320
Luke is doing this knowing full well he might die, but the statement is clear.

01:26:51.320 --> 01:26:54.600
Luke is not going to become his father, even if it kills him.

01:26:54.600 --> 01:26:57.800
Yeah, sometimes George Lucas is caught huffing his farts a bit too much.

01:26:57.800 --> 01:27:08.920
I said to George, you can type this stuff, but you can't say it.

01:27:08.920 --> 01:27:12.920
Move your mouth while you're talking, while you're typing it.

01:27:12.920 --> 01:27:14.240
I couldn't say it.

01:27:14.240 --> 01:27:18.280
But even then, the point I'm making is when you strip away all the Star Wars stuff here

01:27:18.280 --> 01:27:22.400
there's a soul, a moral and ethical through line that cuts right down the center of Luke

01:27:22.400 --> 01:27:23.400
and his journey.

01:27:23.400 --> 01:27:26.780
The movies are trying to tell us something about what it means to be a hero, what quality

01:27:26.780 --> 01:27:31.300
of character a hero has, where that might lead them astray sometimes, and ultimately

01:27:31.300 --> 01:27:34.800
what somebody might have to sacrifice in order to live a good life.

01:27:34.800 --> 01:27:38.040
And George Lucas is okay with outright saying, yeah, this is what the movies are all about.

01:27:38.040 --> 01:27:43.320
Are you saying I am trying to recreate the myths of old or are you saying I just want

01:27:43.320 --> 01:27:46.240
to make a good action movie?

01:27:46.240 --> 01:27:54.520
Well when I did Star Wars, I consciously set about to recreate myths and the classic mythological

01:27:54.520 --> 01:28:00.520
motifs, because I think the core issues that I'm dealing with are if they were valid 2,000

01:28:00.520 --> 01:28:04.640
years ago, they've got to still be valid today, even though they're not in fashion.

01:28:04.640 --> 01:28:05.960
Why are they out of fashion?

01:28:05.960 --> 01:28:07.960
The world we live in is more complex.

01:28:07.960 --> 01:28:12.680
A lot of those moralities have gotten to be grayed to the point where they don't exist

01:28:12.680 --> 01:28:15.920
anymore, but those issues are still there in most people's minds.

01:28:16.800 --> 01:28:21.560
The importance of, say, friendship and loyalty, most people look at that and say, how corny,

01:28:21.560 --> 01:28:26.240
but the issues of friendship and loyalty are very, very important, but it's not common

01:28:26.240 --> 01:28:27.760
knowledge among young people.

01:28:27.760 --> 01:28:28.760
They're still learning.

01:28:28.760 --> 01:28:29.920
They're still picking up ideas.

01:28:29.920 --> 01:28:34.440
They're still using these ideas to shape the way they're going to conduct their life, and

01:28:34.440 --> 01:28:38.560
you need to tell the same story over and over again every generation, so that generation

01:28:38.560 --> 01:28:39.560
gets it.

01:28:39.560 --> 01:28:44.880
And I think we've gone for a few generations where a lot of the more basic stories have

01:28:44.880 --> 01:28:46.280
fallen by the wayside.

01:28:46.280 --> 01:28:51.520
I hear so many young people today talk about a world that's emptied of heroism, where there

01:28:51.520 --> 01:28:55.200
are no more noble things to do.

01:28:55.200 --> 01:28:57.280
What do you say to them?

01:28:57.280 --> 01:29:00.120
Everybody becomes, everybody has the choice of being a hero or not being a hero every

01:29:00.120 --> 01:29:02.280
day of their lives.

01:29:02.280 --> 01:29:06.960
And you can either help somebody be compassionate toward people, or you can treat some people

01:29:06.960 --> 01:29:09.040
with dignity or not.

01:29:09.040 --> 01:29:14.240
And one way you become a hero, and the other way, you know, you're part of the problem.

01:29:14.680 --> 01:29:17.000
And it's not a grand thing.

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:22.920
You know, you don't have to get into a giant laser sword fight and blow up three spaceships

01:29:22.920 --> 01:29:23.920
to become a hero.

01:29:23.920 --> 01:29:27.400
I mean, it's a very small thing that happens every day of your life.

01:29:27.400 --> 01:29:31.640
Though people don't like the prequel trilogy nearly as much, they're still remembered fondly

01:29:31.640 --> 01:29:33.160
for being the mess that they are.

01:29:33.160 --> 01:29:37.680
And Lucas is also quite insistent that these films also have something to say beyond just

01:29:37.680 --> 01:29:38.680
Star Wars.

01:29:38.680 --> 01:29:41.560
In fact, Padme even spotlights the message in case you don't get it.

01:29:41.560 --> 01:29:46.840
So this is how liberty dies, with thunderous applause.

01:29:46.840 --> 01:29:50.840
One of the reasons the prequel trilogy talks so much about politics and economics is because

01:29:50.840 --> 01:29:55.240
it's showing what a fearless, well-meaning, impatient young hero, somebody very much like

01:29:55.240 --> 01:29:59.640
Luke, in fact, can become if he doesn't take the sacrificial path that Luke did.

01:29:59.640 --> 01:30:02.280
Take that scene from episode two where Padme and Anakin talk politics.

01:30:02.280 --> 01:30:04.520
Yeah, that one that became a reaction meme for a while.

01:30:04.520 --> 01:30:07.040
I don't think the system works.

01:30:07.040 --> 01:30:10.080
How would you have it work?

01:30:10.080 --> 01:30:14.680
We need a system where the politicians sit down and discuss the problem.

01:30:14.680 --> 01:30:18.280
Agree what's in the best interest of all the people, and then do it.

01:30:18.280 --> 01:30:20.640
That's exactly what we do.

01:30:20.640 --> 01:30:22.520
The trouble is that people don't always agree.

01:30:22.520 --> 01:30:24.720
Well, then they should be made to.

01:30:24.720 --> 01:30:25.720
By whom?

01:30:25.720 --> 01:30:26.720
Who's gonna make them?

01:30:26.720 --> 01:30:27.720
I don't know.

01:30:27.720 --> 01:30:28.720
Someone.

01:30:28.720 --> 01:30:29.720
You?

01:30:29.720 --> 01:30:30.720
Of course not me.

01:30:30.720 --> 01:30:31.720
But someone.

01:30:31.720 --> 01:30:32.720
Someone wise.

01:30:32.720 --> 01:30:36.880
Sounds an awful lot like a dictatorship to me.

01:30:36.880 --> 01:30:39.240
Well, if it works.

01:30:39.240 --> 01:30:42.080
This is actually the monarchist argument against democracy.

01:30:42.080 --> 01:30:46.520
If democracy really is just a bunch of squabbling, uneducated fools, all having their worthless

01:30:46.520 --> 01:30:51.160
say while a crisis grows more desperate, why shouldn't a strong individual with the expertise

01:30:51.160 --> 01:30:53.400
to solve the problem be in charge instead?

01:30:53.400 --> 01:30:56.360
It's the benevolent dictator, philosopher king argument.

01:30:56.360 --> 01:31:00.640
Palpatine's populist rhetoric during his rise to power, if you transplant it to real life,

01:31:00.640 --> 01:31:03.800
is probably pretty popular with libertarians in how he wants to dismantle components of

01:31:03.800 --> 01:31:06.000
the state and end corruption and shrink bureaucracy.

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:09.800
There is no civility, only politics.

01:31:09.800 --> 01:31:15.520
The senate is full of greedy, squabbling delegates.

01:31:15.520 --> 01:31:18.120
There is no interest in the common good.

01:31:18.120 --> 01:31:22.040
If I may say so, your majesty, the chancellor has little real power.

01:31:22.040 --> 01:31:26.120
He is mired by baseless accusations of corruption.

01:31:26.120 --> 01:31:28.400
The bureaucrats are in charge now.

01:31:28.400 --> 01:31:33.920
Our best choice would be to push for the election of a stronger supreme chancellor, one who

01:31:33.920 --> 01:31:37.920
could control the bureaucrats and give us justice.

01:31:37.920 --> 01:31:43.000
Any other choice would be to submit a plea to the courts.

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:46.040
The courts take even longer to decide things than the senate.

01:31:46.040 --> 01:31:50.200
Your majesty, if I am elected, I promise to put an end to corruption.

01:31:50.200 --> 01:31:52.120
I will be, chancellor.

01:31:52.120 --> 01:31:55.760
I fear by the time you have control of the bureaucrats, senator, there'll be nothing

01:31:55.760 --> 01:31:58.560
left of our people, our way of life.

01:31:58.560 --> 01:32:02.280
It is clear to me now that the republic no longer functions.

01:32:02.280 --> 01:32:05.920
I pray you will bring sanity and compassion back to the senate.

01:32:05.920 --> 01:32:09.920
But what his supporters don't understand, and what he keenly recognizes, is that all

01:32:09.920 --> 01:32:14.660
of those multiple levels of bureaucracy are what keeps political power decentralized.

01:32:14.660 --> 01:32:18.600
That decentralization has led to their current problem, where there's too many interests,

01:32:18.600 --> 01:32:21.960
nobody can agree on anything, and nothing gets done even in the face of a civil war.

01:32:21.960 --> 01:32:25.480
But stripping away those bureaucratic layers, however popular a move it might initially

01:32:25.480 --> 01:32:28.400
be, doesn't destroy the political power vested within them.

01:32:28.400 --> 01:32:31.680
It simply centralizes that power within the remaining bureaucracy.

01:32:31.680 --> 01:32:35.280
The rebellion will continue to gain us support in the imperial senate.

01:32:35.280 --> 01:32:39.460
The imperial senate will no longer be of any concern to us.

01:32:39.460 --> 01:32:43.960
I have just received word that the emperor has dissolved the council permanently.

01:32:43.960 --> 01:32:47.560
The last remnants of the old republic have been swept away.

01:32:47.560 --> 01:32:48.560
That's impossible.

01:32:48.560 --> 01:32:52.400
How will the emperor maintain control without the bureaucracy?

01:32:52.400 --> 01:32:56.760
The regional governors now have direct control over their territories.

01:32:56.760 --> 01:33:00.600
It may very well be the case that if the people within a state's apparatus are corrupt, you

01:33:00.600 --> 01:33:01.600
might need to clean house.

01:33:02.520 --> 01:33:03.520
It's not against that.

01:33:03.520 --> 01:33:05.840
But contrary to what libertarians think, shrinking the state doesn't always shrink

01:33:05.840 --> 01:33:06.840
its power.

01:33:06.840 --> 01:33:10.880
Sometimes, it centralizes that power into a system with a single point of failure.

01:33:10.880 --> 01:33:15.200
That's why the rebellion's decisive strikes, at just the right target, are so devastating

01:33:15.200 --> 01:33:16.260
throughout the series.

01:33:16.260 --> 01:33:20.040
Because when you weaken a state's bureaucracy, you monopolize the state's power into one

01:33:20.040 --> 01:33:23.400
autocratic leader, and at that point, all you have to do is kill him.

01:33:23.400 --> 01:33:25.080
That is the lesson of the prequels.

01:33:25.080 --> 01:33:27.880
The dangers of seduction, both sexual and political.

01:33:27.880 --> 01:33:31.400
It's tempting to think that you know all the answers, that you can handle the forbidden

01:33:31.400 --> 01:33:32.400
fruit.

01:33:32.400 --> 01:33:33.400
But you don't.

01:33:33.400 --> 01:33:34.400
And you can't.

01:33:34.400 --> 01:33:36.000
Of course, the prequels have many problems.

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.040
Like a lot of what the Jedi are don't really make sense.

01:33:38.040 --> 01:33:39.960
For example, why do the Jedi wear these robes?

01:33:39.960 --> 01:33:42.300
Well, because that's what Obi-Wan wore in the original trilogy.

01:33:42.300 --> 01:33:45.800
But if Obi-Wan's in hiding, why would he specifically run around in the uniform of

01:33:45.800 --> 01:33:47.100
a persecuted class of people?

01:33:47.100 --> 01:33:49.080
Why do all the Jedi act like creepy cult members?

01:33:49.080 --> 01:33:53.040
Well, because Luke's journey from regular kid to Jedi Knight saw him become serious

01:33:53.040 --> 01:33:54.040
and somber.

01:33:54.040 --> 01:33:56.040
But that's only because of what he was going through with his father.

01:33:56.040 --> 01:34:00.080
That is the limitation of George Lucas's iconic hero's journey style of storytelling,

01:34:00.080 --> 01:34:02.100
when it butts up against a cultural phenomenon.

01:34:02.100 --> 01:34:05.880
Whatever becomes emblematic of an idea is what sticks, even if it doesn't really make

01:34:05.880 --> 01:34:06.880
any sense.

01:34:06.880 --> 01:34:10.400
But it's this rough-around-the-edges nature of Lucas's Star Wars that lead internet

01:34:10.400 --> 01:34:15.300
soy boys nowadays to justify the moral bankruptcy of Disney's Star Wars.

01:34:15.300 --> 01:34:19.240
So if the original story is telling us how to be a sacrificial hero, and the prequel

01:34:19.240 --> 01:34:23.740
story is telling us what happens if you reject the call, what does the sequel trilogy tell

01:34:23.740 --> 01:34:24.740
us?

01:34:24.740 --> 01:34:28.360
As far as I can tell, The Force Awakens exists to tell us that Star Wars is really cool.

01:34:28.360 --> 01:34:30.000
Everything is a reference or a callback.

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:34.000
They exist not as trappings of a larger story, but as the larger story itself.

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:37.760
Where before the movies would explain a political crisis and the various parties therein, or

01:34:37.760 --> 01:34:41.240
a personal conflict between characters with a lot of history, now the movie goes out of

01:34:41.240 --> 01:34:42.800
its way to not explain anything at all.

01:34:42.800 --> 01:34:45.240
J.J. Abrams said he wanted the Star Wars comedy back.

01:34:45.240 --> 01:34:49.280
But where before comedy accentuated characterization, here it undercuts it.

01:34:49.280 --> 01:34:52.480
The characters in the setting are reset back to the way things were in A New Hope, only

01:34:52.480 --> 01:34:53.640
this time with less explanation.

01:34:53.640 --> 01:34:56.000
There's an empire and a rebellion with different names.

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:59.120
Luke is isolated from everyone, Leia is a political leader fighting the power.

01:34:59.240 --> 01:35:02.880
Han Solo is a smooth talker desperately trying to hide the fact that he's a broke bum.

01:35:02.880 --> 01:35:06.620
All of the growth and change is reversed, so we can do Star Wars again.

01:35:06.620 --> 01:35:08.240
What does The Last Jedi have to tell us?

01:35:08.240 --> 01:35:10.920
Well, pretty much the opposite of The Force Awakens.

01:35:10.920 --> 01:35:12.040
Star Wars is bad.

01:35:12.040 --> 01:35:15.700
Where in Empire, Luke would never abandon his friends, and in Return of the Jedi, Luke

01:35:15.700 --> 01:35:17.960
chose not to kill the defenseless.

01:35:17.960 --> 01:35:21.000
Here we discover that Luke did both of those things in his old age.

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:24.440
Everyone talks about the phrase, subverting expectations with this movie, and yeah, fair

01:35:24.440 --> 01:35:25.440
enough.

01:35:25.440 --> 01:35:35.280
I don't want to go into just how bad this movie is right now.

01:35:35.280 --> 01:35:39.560
This video is long enough, but I don't think the phrase, subvert expectations, is the ethic

01:35:39.560 --> 01:35:40.560
of this movie.

01:35:40.560 --> 01:35:42.680
Instead, it can be summed up in these scenes.

01:35:42.680 --> 01:35:45.920
It's time to let old things die.

01:35:45.920 --> 01:35:57.480
Snoke, Skywalker, the Sith, the Jedi, the Rebels, let it all die.

01:35:57.480 --> 01:36:03.480
Let the past die, kill it if you have to.

01:36:03.480 --> 01:36:06.320
We have what they grow beyond.

01:36:06.320 --> 01:36:11.440
That is the true burden of all masters.

01:36:11.440 --> 01:36:13.680
The idea here is that Star Wars is changing.

01:36:13.680 --> 01:36:16.280
It doesn't have to be about Skywalkers and Kenobi's anymore.

01:36:16.280 --> 01:36:17.280
It can be about anybody.

01:36:17.280 --> 01:36:18.940
That's the point of the final shot of the movie.

01:36:18.940 --> 01:36:21.480
This kid isn't anybody important, and yet he can use the Force.

01:36:21.480 --> 01:36:23.760
It's a grand moral equalization.

01:36:23.760 --> 01:36:25.260
The old institutions don't matter.

01:36:25.260 --> 01:36:28.680
We can make things how we want them to be, and they don't need to be Star Wars.

01:36:28.680 --> 01:36:31.560
So what is the rise of Skywalker telling us then?

01:36:31.560 --> 01:36:35.200
Well, the lesson of The Force Awakens is that we can no longer make anything new.

01:36:35.200 --> 01:36:37.600
We must remain tethered to what Star Wars was.

01:36:37.600 --> 01:36:40.960
At the same time, the lesson of The Last Jedi is that we can no longer hold on to anything

01:36:40.960 --> 01:36:41.960
old.

01:36:41.960 --> 01:36:43.000
The slate must be wiped clean.

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:46.240
Despite how it sounds, these two ideas actually fit together.

01:36:46.240 --> 01:36:50.180
In a Hegelian sense, if The Force Awakens is the thesis and The Last Jedi is the antithesis,

01:36:50.180 --> 01:36:52.120
The Rise of Skywalker is the synthesis.

01:36:52.120 --> 01:36:55.460
It's a movie that is simultaneously tethered to the past while rejecting it.

01:36:55.460 --> 01:37:00.160
It wipes the slate clean and then uses that space to build a simulacrum of what came before.

01:37:00.160 --> 01:37:03.880
The ethics of Star Wars at this point are gone, and what remains is only the window

01:37:03.880 --> 01:37:04.880
dressing.

01:37:04.880 --> 01:37:08.160
There are X-wings and lightsabers and stormtroopers and star destroyers, but the core has been

01:37:08.160 --> 01:37:09.160
hollowed out.

01:37:09.160 --> 01:37:11.560
That's why it rings so hollow when Carrie Fisher says

01:37:11.560 --> 01:37:15.560
It's about family, and that's what's so powerful about it.

01:37:15.560 --> 01:37:16.560
We know they're not.

01:37:16.560 --> 01:37:19.200
They're about being about family, which is a very different idea.

01:37:19.200 --> 01:37:22.880
At least Mark Hamill was a lot more honest about them.

01:37:22.880 --> 01:37:28.360
I said to Ryan, I said, I think I fundamentally disagree with pretty much everything you've

01:37:28.360 --> 01:37:29.560
decided for me.

01:37:29.560 --> 01:37:35.760
Now, having said that, I have to accept it, get my mind around it, and do my best to realize

01:37:35.760 --> 01:37:36.760
your vision.

01:37:36.760 --> 01:37:39.600
But I said to Ryan, I said, Jedis don't give up.

01:37:39.600 --> 01:37:46.640
I mean, even if he had a problem, he would maybe take a year to try and regroup.

01:37:46.640 --> 01:37:49.200
But if he made a mistake, he would try and right that wrong.

01:37:49.200 --> 01:37:51.400
So right there, we had a fundamental difference.

01:37:51.400 --> 01:37:53.960
But it's not my story anymore.

01:37:53.960 --> 01:37:59.160
It's somebody else's story, and Ryan needed me to be a certain way to make the ending

01:37:59.160 --> 01:38:00.860
effective.

01:38:00.860 --> 01:38:04.600
That's the crux of my problem.

01:38:04.600 --> 01:38:06.680
Luke would never say that.

01:38:06.680 --> 01:38:07.680
I'm sorry.

01:38:07.680 --> 01:38:11.800
Well, in this version, see, I'm talking about the George Lucas Star Wars.

01:38:11.800 --> 01:38:13.800
This is the next generation of Star Wars.

01:38:13.800 --> 01:38:17.320
So I almost had to think of Luke as another character.

01:38:17.320 --> 01:38:18.800
Maybe he's Jake Skywalker.

01:38:18.800 --> 01:38:21.200
He's not my Luke Skywalker.

01:38:21.200 --> 01:38:26.680
But I had to do what Ryan wanted me to do because it serves the story well.

01:38:26.680 --> 01:38:29.560
But listen, I still haven't accepted it completely.

01:38:29.560 --> 01:38:30.940
But it's only a movie.

01:38:30.940 --> 01:38:32.040
I hope people like it.

01:38:32.040 --> 01:38:33.320
I hope they don't get upset.

01:38:33.320 --> 01:38:38.280
In other words, the Star Wars sequel trilogy teaches us how you build a progressive skin

01:38:38.280 --> 01:38:39.280
suit.

01:38:39.280 --> 01:38:43.440
First, stagnation is celebrated by way of worshipping the aesthetics of the Thing.

01:38:43.440 --> 01:38:47.340
Secondly, revolution is celebrated by way of discrediting all the old ethical achievements

01:38:47.340 --> 01:38:48.340
of the Thing.

01:38:48.340 --> 01:38:52.440
Finally, these two ideas are married into a creation that is simply mechanical in how

01:38:52.440 --> 01:38:53.700
it operates.

01:38:53.700 --> 01:38:56.760
Scenes happen only because they must happen to reach the next scene.

01:38:56.760 --> 01:39:00.880
Conflicts or revelations or sacrifices occur not because they further anything, but because

01:39:00.880 --> 01:39:03.980
this is around the point in time the audience expects to see one.

01:39:03.980 --> 01:39:07.600
Nothing makes sense, but nothing needs to because we've deconstructed the idea of

01:39:07.600 --> 01:39:08.760
cause and effect.

01:39:08.760 --> 01:39:13.480
Things might be set up and then paid off like in an actual movie, but there's no underlying

01:39:13.480 --> 01:39:14.940
action and reaction.

01:39:14.940 --> 01:39:16.820
The progressive skin suit is complete.

01:39:16.820 --> 01:39:21.040
It looks like Star Wars, but deep inside it is in fact anti-Star Wars.

01:39:21.040 --> 01:39:24.080
You can't even make new films anymore, not without disregarding 7, 8, and 9.

01:39:24.080 --> 01:39:25.600
Where would you go with the story?

01:39:25.600 --> 01:39:28.900
Everything's already been ruined by people who didn't care that they were ruining it.

01:39:28.900 --> 01:39:32.400
Which makes it pretty fucking hilarious that Kathleen Kennedy complained there was no

01:39:32.400 --> 01:39:37.360
more Star Wars stories to make, considering that Lucasfilm de-canonized nearly everything

01:39:37.360 --> 01:39:39.040
and then deconstructed the rest.

01:39:39.040 --> 01:39:42.380
And by the way, it should be no surprise that George Lucas isn't all that happy with how

01:39:42.380 --> 01:39:43.380
it's going either.

01:39:43.380 --> 01:39:46.140
Bob Iger said, gee, if you really want to sell your company, if you're thinking about

01:39:46.140 --> 01:39:48.660
selling it, because we were talking about retirement and what are you going to do after

01:39:48.660 --> 01:39:49.660
all this.

01:39:49.660 --> 01:39:52.660
And he said, well, you really want to sell it, you know, we're very interested.

01:39:52.660 --> 01:40:02.380
I sold them to the white slavers that take these things and I made a decision to move

01:40:02.380 --> 01:40:05.800
ahead on the next Star Wars series and we were starting to do that.

01:40:05.800 --> 01:40:08.820
So you were starting to make the next Star Wars?

01:40:08.820 --> 01:40:09.820
Yeah.

01:40:09.820 --> 01:40:11.960
You as director, filmmaker?

01:40:11.960 --> 01:40:13.800
They wanted to do a retro movie.

01:40:13.800 --> 01:40:14.800
I don't like that.

01:40:14.800 --> 01:40:19.420
I like every movie, I worked very hard to make them different and make them completely

01:40:19.420 --> 01:40:24.140
different with different planets, with different spaceships, with different, you know, to make

01:40:24.140 --> 01:40:25.420
it new.

01:40:25.420 --> 01:40:27.740
They decided they didn't want to use those stories.

01:40:27.740 --> 01:40:29.260
They decided they were going to go do their own thing.

01:40:29.260 --> 01:40:36.060
And so I decided fine, but basically I'm not going to try to, they weren't that keen to

01:40:36.060 --> 01:40:37.060
have me involved anyway.

01:40:37.060 --> 01:40:39.700
But at the same time, I said, I'm not going to, if I get in there, I'm just going to cause

01:40:39.700 --> 01:40:42.540
trouble because they're not going to do what I want them to do.

01:40:42.540 --> 01:40:44.580
So I don't have the control to do that anymore.

01:40:44.580 --> 01:40:46.240
And all I would do is muck everything up.

01:40:46.240 --> 01:40:49.440
Now then, let's finally return to the Obi-Wan Kenobi show.

01:40:49.440 --> 01:40:52.440
Remember earlier when I said that the plot feels like it was written by an algorithm,

01:40:52.440 --> 01:40:56.520
like they had this idea for the one truly emotional moment where Vader absolves Obi-Wan

01:40:56.520 --> 01:41:00.680
of his guilt, and then just had a machine write a bunch of stuff that served no purpose

01:41:00.680 --> 01:41:04.040
other than to get us there and fill the allotted time in the Disney Plus schedule?

01:41:04.040 --> 01:41:06.020
Now you know why it feels that way.

01:41:06.020 --> 01:41:10.880
The way I like to work is you try and come up with visual milestones of like, well, I'd

01:41:10.880 --> 01:41:13.360
love to see this, and I'd love to see this, and I'd love to see this.

01:41:13.360 --> 01:41:14.840
I'm not sure how they all connect.

01:41:14.840 --> 01:41:19.640
And then what you do is you create visuals of things that would be great, and then you

01:41:19.640 --> 01:41:21.760
try and find a way of linking them all.

01:41:21.760 --> 01:41:25.440
And using this mode of analysis, you can go back and rewatch the gradual decline of any

01:41:25.440 --> 01:41:29.280
property that covered up its failings by claiming to subvert expectations, and you'll probably

01:41:29.280 --> 01:41:34.320
see the exact same process underneath of how they built the progressive skin suit.

01:41:34.320 --> 01:41:37.840
We're, uh, we're not re-going over Obi-Wan again using this lens.

01:41:37.840 --> 01:41:39.800
No thank you, you can do that on your own fucking time.

01:41:39.800 --> 01:41:42.800
But I do want to give you one solid example from the show.

01:41:42.840 --> 01:41:45.000
Everyone is coming their pants over Riva.

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:48.520
She's so complex and deep, because she didn't kill young Luke, you guys.

01:41:48.520 --> 01:41:52.280
The truth is, no, she's confused, which only has the appearance of complexity.

01:41:52.280 --> 01:41:56.000
And in order for us to get to this moment, where Riva is broken and has to put herself

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:59.820
back together again, the writers have to directly violate her established character.

01:41:59.820 --> 01:42:02.280
That doesn't matter, only getting to the end result does.

01:42:02.280 --> 01:42:04.600
Now compare Riva to Luke in The Empire Strikes Back.

01:42:04.600 --> 01:42:06.400
Luke isn't confused like Riva is.

01:42:06.400 --> 01:42:11.100
Rather, Luke's heroic traits are the cause of his downfall, and the Force itself is trying

01:42:11.100 --> 01:42:12.200
to warn him.

01:42:12.200 --> 01:42:16.720
Luke may enter a self-destructive spiral and hit rock bottom, but at no point does he ever

01:42:16.720 --> 01:42:18.160
act out of character.

01:42:18.160 --> 01:42:22.760
His loyalty, his impulsivity, and his bravery, all heroic traits, are what Vader uses to

01:42:22.760 --> 01:42:24.120
draw him into his trap.

01:42:24.120 --> 01:42:25.120
That's the difference.

01:42:25.120 --> 01:42:28.160
The culmination of Luke's arc happens because of who he is.

01:42:28.160 --> 01:42:31.880
The culmination of Riva's arc happens in spite of who she is.

01:42:31.880 --> 01:42:34.440
But if you squint your eyes, it kind of looks the same.

01:42:34.440 --> 01:42:36.920
So this is what Disney is going to be doing going forward.

01:42:36.920 --> 01:42:41.120
Kenobi, and almost everything else that Disney has done since taking over Lucasfilm, is a

01:42:41.120 --> 01:42:43.160
Star Wars homunculus.

01:42:43.160 --> 01:42:46.800
This is the progressive skin suit, and Disney is hoping that you won't look close enough

01:42:46.800 --> 01:42:54.260
to notice.

01:42:54.260 --> 01:42:57.360
Of course, if you complain about any of this, you're a bigot.

01:42:57.360 --> 01:43:01.600
It's not that you're a diehard fan who's dismayed at the cultural rot encroaching on the stuff

01:43:01.600 --> 01:43:02.600
you grew up with.

01:43:02.600 --> 01:43:04.780
The problem has to be you, not them.

01:43:04.780 --> 01:43:05.780
Only kinda, though.

01:43:05.780 --> 01:43:08.640
If the show is pro-progressive and you complain, you're the problem.

01:43:08.640 --> 01:43:12.860
But if the show does something that progressives don't like, then it's the show's problem.

01:43:12.860 --> 01:43:17.480
For example, back in May, when the first two episodes of Obi-Wan Kenobi dropped to an auditorium

01:43:17.480 --> 01:43:21.440
full of devoted fans, after the initial screening, the audience took to Twitter to complain about

01:43:21.440 --> 01:43:22.520
how triggering it was.

01:43:22.520 --> 01:43:26.560
Remember, the show opens on Order 66, and it just so happens that the Uvalde school

01:43:26.560 --> 01:43:28.280
shooting went down the same day.

01:43:28.280 --> 01:43:32.400
And oh boy, the internet had no problem talking about how it was Disney's fault that they

01:43:32.400 --> 01:43:35.980
didn't see the shooting coming and reschedule their premiere.

01:43:35.980 --> 01:43:36.980
Trigger warning!

01:43:36.980 --> 01:43:38.900
Had to pause and literally sob.

01:43:38.900 --> 01:43:39.900
Huge trigger warning.

01:43:39.900 --> 01:43:44.920
It literally starts off with the attack on Jedi younglings in their temple slash school.

01:43:44.920 --> 01:43:47.140
What the fuck was Disney thinking?

01:43:47.140 --> 01:43:49.520
Obi-Wan should have had trigger warnings after Uvalde.

01:43:49.520 --> 01:43:51.060
That nearly made me vomit.

01:43:51.060 --> 01:43:56.260
The cold open of Obi-Wan is a bunch of Jedi kids getting gunned down by stormtroopers.

01:43:56.260 --> 01:43:58.020
And it's super fucking triggering.

01:43:58.020 --> 01:44:00.540
And I literally can't believe they released that right now.

01:44:00.540 --> 01:44:04.820
Hey Disney, given current events, can we add a content warning to the first episode of

01:44:04.820 --> 01:44:05.820
Obi-Wan?

01:44:05.860 --> 01:44:07.900
I'm too sick to my stomach just reading about it.

01:44:07.900 --> 01:44:11.820
These people are fully grown adults who feel like shows targeted at their demographic,

01:44:11.820 --> 01:44:15.980
you know, adults, are somehow too violent, to the point that they're protesting online.

01:44:15.980 --> 01:44:19.660
And the violence we're talking about isn't like gratuitous gore or something.

01:44:19.660 --> 01:44:22.540
It's people getting shot and stabbed with laser weapons.

01:44:22.540 --> 01:44:25.220
Kids were sneaking in to see R-rated films in the 90s.

01:44:25.220 --> 01:44:30.880
Now those same kids are soy boy adults crying that PG-13 is too much for them to handle.

01:44:30.880 --> 01:44:34.500
Part of the progressive skin suit is rounding the corners, sanding down the bumps, making

01:44:34.500 --> 01:44:39.100
everything appear epic but have no actual stakes because we can't let anybody get

01:44:39.100 --> 01:44:40.420
emotionally upset.

01:44:40.420 --> 01:44:48.240
So when a bit of the old lore filters through from the before times, when tragedies actually

01:44:48.240 --> 01:44:52.100
happened in a narrative, these padded room zoomers can't fucking take it.

01:44:52.100 --> 01:44:57.120
However, when actual Star Wars fans voiced their actual opinions on the actual problems

01:44:57.120 --> 01:44:59.980
with the Obi-Wan show, doesn't matter which problem, take your pick.

01:44:59.980 --> 01:45:02.340
I've given you over 9000 of them at this point.

01:45:02.340 --> 01:45:05.380
Disney falls back on ol' reliable, racism.

01:45:05.380 --> 01:45:10.460
The Star Wars fandom's racism problem, Moses Ingram, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and ongoing racist

01:45:10.460 --> 01:45:14.700
toxicity in the Star Wars community, Ingram plays the main villain in the new Star Wars

01:45:14.700 --> 01:45:17.720
show Obi-Wan Kenobi, a Jedi hunter named Riva.

01:45:17.720 --> 01:45:22.460
After the series' debut, the actress, who is capital B Black, revealed on Instagram

01:45:22.460 --> 01:45:26.140
she's been bombarded with hundreds of racism threatening messages, with one telling her

01:45:26.140 --> 01:45:28.500
her days are numbered, and another using the N-word.

01:45:28.500 --> 01:45:32.500
Damn, well, alright, let's head over to her Instagram and take a look.

01:45:32.500 --> 01:45:36.140
Jesus, holy hell girl, what the fuck, why is that your avatar?

01:45:36.140 --> 01:45:39.420
Uh, give me, give me a second, guys.

01:45:39.420 --> 01:45:41.220
Alright, here's her Instagram video.

01:45:41.220 --> 01:45:43.500
You suck, loser, you're a diversity hire.

01:45:43.500 --> 01:45:46.580
Operation Get Behind the Darkies is real, JESUS CHRIST.

01:45:46.580 --> 01:45:49.860
Ayo, Kenobi, you ain't finna run forever, white boy.

01:45:49.860 --> 01:45:54.180
You have now been converted into the Saint George of Floydium of Star Wars.

01:45:54.180 --> 01:45:57.020
How the fuck does an alien know Ebonics?

01:45:57.020 --> 01:46:00.500
Yeah, this is pretty shitty.

01:46:00.500 --> 01:46:03.460
There are hundreds of those.

01:46:03.460 --> 01:46:05.740
Hundreds.

01:46:05.740 --> 01:46:11.560
And I also see those of you out there who put on a cape for me, and that really does

01:46:11.560 --> 01:46:21.880
mean the world to me, because, you know, there's nothing anybody can do about this.

01:46:21.880 --> 01:46:26.300
There's nothing anybody can do to stop this hate.

01:46:26.300 --> 01:46:31.720
And so I question what my purpose is, and even being here in front of you, saying that

01:46:31.720 --> 01:46:37.280
this is happening.

01:46:37.280 --> 01:46:39.560
I don't really know.

01:46:39.560 --> 01:46:43.920
I don't really know.

01:46:43.920 --> 01:46:51.440
But I think the thing that bothers me is that, like, sort of this feeling that I've had inside

01:46:51.440 --> 01:46:55.880
of myself, which no one has told me, but this feeling of like, I just got to shut

01:46:55.880 --> 01:47:00.520
up and take it, you know, I just kind of got to bury it.

01:47:00.520 --> 01:47:01.940
And I'm not built like that.

01:47:01.940 --> 01:47:09.080
So I really just wanted to come on, I think, and say thank you to the people who show up

01:47:09.080 --> 01:47:14.440
for me in the comments and the places that I'm not gonna put myself.

01:47:14.440 --> 01:47:20.360
And to the rest of y'all, y'all weird.

01:47:20.360 --> 01:47:23.920
Shiva is kind of a garbage character, but Moses Ingram was pretty good in the Queen's

01:47:23.920 --> 01:47:24.920
Gambit.

01:47:24.920 --> 01:47:26.240
She's probably a fine person in private.

01:47:26.240 --> 01:47:27.240
It's not her fault.

01:47:27.240 --> 01:47:30.740
I've never really liked the idea of attacking an actor or actress just because the character

01:47:30.740 --> 01:47:35.600
they play is evil, or worse, badly written, or worse, badly acted.

01:47:35.600 --> 01:47:39.640
Best case scenario on the side of the angry fans, it's not Moses Ingram's fault that Star

01:47:39.640 --> 01:47:41.820
Wars writers were looking for a diversity hire.

01:47:41.820 --> 01:47:42.820
That's Disney's fault.

01:47:42.820 --> 01:47:45.640
She was just taking the job she was offered, like anybody reasonable would.

01:47:45.640 --> 01:47:46.880
You gotta chase that paper.

01:47:46.880 --> 01:47:49.180
Personally, I think she did an okay job with what she was given.

01:47:49.180 --> 01:47:50.980
She was just given garbage.

01:47:50.980 --> 01:47:55.340
After her video went viral, Owen McGregor recorded his own to show his support.

01:47:55.340 --> 01:48:01.900
This weekend, Star Wars fans made Obi-Wan Kenobi the most watched Disney Plus original

01:48:01.900 --> 01:48:04.360
series premiere of all time.

01:48:04.360 --> 01:48:07.380
And for that, I would say a big thank you.

01:48:07.380 --> 01:48:12.740
And it just goes to show what this family can do when we all pull together.

01:48:12.740 --> 01:48:19.220
However, it seems that some of the fan base from this influential fan base have decided

01:48:19.220 --> 01:48:25.400
to attack Moses Ingram online and send her the most horrendous racist DMs.

01:48:25.400 --> 01:48:29.640
And I heard some of them this morning and it just broke my heart.

01:48:29.640 --> 01:48:31.460
Moses is a brilliant actor.

01:48:31.460 --> 01:48:33.020
She's a brilliant woman.

01:48:33.020 --> 01:48:35.340
And she's absolutely amazing in this series.

01:48:35.340 --> 01:48:39.260
She brings so much to the series, she brings so much to the franchise.

01:48:39.260 --> 01:48:43.220
And it just sickened me to my stomach to hear that this had been happening.

01:48:43.220 --> 01:48:49.020
I just want to say as the leading actor in the series, as the executive producer in the

01:48:49.020 --> 01:48:52.260
series, that we stand with Moses.

01:48:52.260 --> 01:48:53.540
We love Moses.

01:48:53.540 --> 01:48:56.700
Again, mostly a completely reasonable response.

01:48:56.700 --> 01:48:58.160
Anybody who's worked on a set will tell you.

01:48:58.160 --> 01:49:01.340
The lead actor is like the informal dad of the set family.

01:49:01.340 --> 01:49:03.580
He's probably feeling protective of Ingram right now.

01:49:03.580 --> 01:49:06.100
However, where he goes off the rails is at the end.

01:49:06.100 --> 01:49:11.140
And if you're sending her bullying messages, you're no Star Wars fan in my mind.

01:49:11.140 --> 01:49:13.980
There's no place for racism in this world.

01:49:13.980 --> 01:49:17.020
And I totally stand with Moses.

01:49:17.020 --> 01:49:19.780
I'm not simping for the racists here, all right?

01:49:19.780 --> 01:49:24.820
But as objectionable as I find them, you absolutely can like Star Wars and be a racist.

01:49:24.820 --> 01:49:25.820
They're unrelated things.

01:49:25.820 --> 01:49:26.940
Here's a funny thing, though.

01:49:26.940 --> 01:49:29.280
Moses Ingram's video dropped on May 31st.

01:49:29.280 --> 01:49:34.460
But on May 22nd, five days before parts one and two of the show were released, Moses Ingram

01:49:34.460 --> 01:49:37.260
gave this interview with The Independent, where she said,

01:49:37.260 --> 01:49:40.940
Obi-Wan is going to bring the most diversity I think we've seen in the galaxy before.

01:49:40.940 --> 01:49:42.020
To me, it's long overdue.

01:49:42.020 --> 01:49:45.740
If you've got talking droids and aliens, but no people of color, it doesn't make any sense.

01:49:45.740 --> 01:49:46.740
It's 2022, you know.

01:49:46.740 --> 01:49:48.780
So we're just at the beginning of that change.

01:49:48.780 --> 01:49:51.300
But I think to start that change is better than never having started.

01:49:51.300 --> 01:49:52.820
Are you butt fucking kidding me?

01:49:52.820 --> 01:49:54.260
What about Lando Calrissian?

01:49:54.260 --> 01:49:55.260
Mace Windu?

01:49:55.260 --> 01:49:56.260
Jango Fett?

01:49:56.260 --> 01:49:59.100
Maybe the problem isn't that Star Wars lacks people of color.

01:49:59.100 --> 01:50:02.980
It's that the new people of color being brought on aren't actually very good at their jobs.

01:50:02.980 --> 01:50:06.320
Hell, there's new people of color being brought on that are doing pretty good jobs.

01:50:06.320 --> 01:50:08.360
So maybe the issue isn't race.

01:50:08.360 --> 01:50:12.620
It's no secret that, for example, Jake Lloyd's life has completely fallen apart since the

01:50:12.620 --> 01:50:16.860
Phantom Menace, and he lays at least part of the blame at the feet of Star Wars fans

01:50:16.860 --> 01:50:19.660
who treated him exceptionally poorly when he was a child.

01:50:19.660 --> 01:50:21.140
And you know, fair enough.

01:50:21.140 --> 01:50:22.540
But Lloyd's white.

01:50:22.540 --> 01:50:26.400
Maybe you can make an argument that some parts of the Star Wars fandom is toxic.

01:50:26.400 --> 01:50:29.220
But is that problem based on race?

01:50:29.220 --> 01:50:30.220
Absolutely not.

01:50:30.460 --> 01:50:33.740
Billy Dee Williams was considered the smoothest dude in the original trilogy.

01:50:33.740 --> 01:50:36.060
That guy broke out the Colt .45 after every scene.

01:50:36.060 --> 01:50:41.420
She's pouring a Colt .45, and we all know what that means.

01:50:41.420 --> 01:50:43.780
You mind if I join you?

01:50:43.780 --> 01:50:46.220
You must have read my mind.

01:50:46.220 --> 01:50:47.420
Something like that.

01:50:47.420 --> 01:50:52.740
I find the idea that Star Wars fans are just blanket racist really hard to buy.

01:50:52.740 --> 01:50:55.260
It just doesn't track with reality.

01:50:55.260 --> 01:50:59.460
Here's some classic Star Wars fans on the eve of the release of The Return of the Jedi.

01:50:59.580 --> 01:51:02.180
All I've got to say, the Jedi have returned.

01:51:02.180 --> 01:51:05.140
We're just fanatics out here waiting on Return of the Jedi.

01:51:05.140 --> 01:51:06.140
Three years in the making.

01:51:06.140 --> 01:51:07.140
We're waiting for this.

01:51:07.140 --> 01:51:10.180
Some people don't idolize Darth Vader like I do.

01:51:10.180 --> 01:51:12.700
See, I want him to get Luke.

01:51:12.700 --> 01:51:17.140
And I think that Luke will destroy Darth Vader.

01:51:17.140 --> 01:51:18.420
I guess Darth Vader will die.

01:51:18.420 --> 01:51:19.420
I'm not sure.

01:51:19.420 --> 01:51:20.420
I hope he doesn't.

01:51:20.420 --> 01:51:21.420
I love his black.

01:51:21.420 --> 01:51:24.180
I think it's surprising to see all of them together at the end playing pinochle and having

01:51:24.180 --> 01:51:25.180
a great time.

01:51:25.180 --> 01:51:27.860
I wish I was there, and I'm going to try to get a part of the next movie myself.

01:51:27.860 --> 01:51:31.460
This has left me practically utterly speechless, actually, you know, but it was the best one

01:51:31.460 --> 01:51:32.460
ever.

01:51:32.460 --> 01:51:36.980
The big surprise was seeing Darth Vader unveil himself to his son.

01:51:36.980 --> 01:51:37.980
It was very exciting.

01:51:37.980 --> 01:51:38.980
The biggest surprise?

01:51:38.980 --> 01:51:40.980
Well, I don't want to give it away to anybody.

01:51:40.980 --> 01:51:44.180
Do you think it was worth coming to this late at night?

01:51:44.180 --> 01:51:45.180
Yeah.

01:51:45.180 --> 01:51:46.660
Looks like it's straight out of a KKK meeting.

01:51:46.660 --> 01:51:47.660
Am I right, guys?

01:51:47.660 --> 01:51:51.660
Ingram also stated, This was something that Lucasfilm actually got in front of and said,

01:51:51.660 --> 01:51:55.020
This is a thing that unfortunately likely will happen, but we are here to help you.

01:51:55.020 --> 01:51:56.420
You can let us know when it happens.

01:51:56.420 --> 01:51:58.740
Disney is referring to her getting racist DMS and stuff.

01:51:58.740 --> 01:52:00.740
They knew this was going to happen before it did.

01:52:00.740 --> 01:52:02.460
So good faith to Disney.

01:52:02.460 --> 01:52:05.560
Everybody should recognize that some people online are just assholes.

01:52:05.560 --> 01:52:06.560
That's it.

01:52:06.560 --> 01:52:10.260
They are going to say racist shit in the DMS, even if you do an amazing job.

01:52:10.260 --> 01:52:14.820
But if Disney knows the show is going to be bad, getting ahead of it might entail spinning

01:52:14.820 --> 01:52:19.220
up a story of racism before any such racism even happens as a defense.

01:52:19.220 --> 01:52:23.440
Therefore, the guy who's actually in Moses Ingram's DMS being a racist and the guy who

01:52:23.440 --> 01:52:27.480
thinks the Obi Wan show sucks and has real complaints because Disney got out ahead of

01:52:27.480 --> 01:52:28.480
the story.

01:52:28.480 --> 01:52:29.800
They can spin it like those two are linked.

01:52:29.800 --> 01:52:33.400
The most cynical part of my brain thinks they might have actually planned this, like, Oh,

01:52:33.400 --> 01:52:35.480
thank God Moses Ingram got sent racist messages.

01:52:35.480 --> 01:52:38.800
Now we can go to Twitter and activate the woke spin cycle and generate some press for

01:52:38.800 --> 01:52:40.520
this god awful show of ours.

01:52:40.520 --> 01:52:41.520
And you know what?

01:52:41.520 --> 01:52:42.520
That's exactly what they did.

01:52:42.520 --> 01:52:44.240
Here's the official Star Wars Twitter account.

01:52:44.240 --> 01:52:48.400
We are proud to welcome Moses Ingram to the Star Wars family, and we're excited for Reeva's

01:52:48.400 --> 01:52:49.500
story to unfold.

01:52:49.500 --> 01:52:53.700
If anyone intends to make her feel in any way unwelcome, we have only one thing to say

01:52:53.700 --> 01:52:55.020
we resist.

01:52:55.020 --> 01:52:58.760
There are more than 20 million sentient species in the Star Wars galaxy.

01:52:58.760 --> 01:53:00.280
Don't choose to be a racist.

01:53:00.280 --> 01:53:01.940
Make it all about the controversy guys.

01:53:01.940 --> 01:53:06.120
Don't talk about the show's shoddy writing or middling quality or awful new characters.

01:53:06.120 --> 01:53:07.800
Make it all about racism.

01:53:07.800 --> 01:53:12.440
Two black female Star Wars characters, one liked and the other disliked by fans, almost

01:53:12.440 --> 01:53:14.860
as if it is less about demographics than quality.

01:53:14.860 --> 01:53:17.820
This is literally the I have a black friend argument.

01:53:17.820 --> 01:53:22.340
Being racist does not just refer to donning a white hood and being overtly racist.

01:53:22.340 --> 01:53:26.420
It also includes things like implicit bias, you can like some black characters and still

01:53:26.420 --> 01:53:27.420
be a racist.

01:53:27.420 --> 01:53:28.840
Man, I've never understood this.

01:53:28.840 --> 01:53:31.800
Why would a black person still be friends with somebody who's a racist?

01:53:31.800 --> 01:53:34.460
Why would a racist still like black characters and actors?

01:53:34.460 --> 01:53:38.160
Where's the implicit bias when you think that Reeva fucking sucks as a villain?

01:53:38.160 --> 01:53:41.460
You know, I'm just not willing to take any fucking guff from the company that puts this

01:53:41.460 --> 01:53:46.400
woke virtue signaling shit out on Twitter, while at the same time actually acting overtly

01:53:46.400 --> 01:53:49.500
racist and homophobic themselves in the overseas markets.

01:53:49.500 --> 01:53:53.300
If you're not willing to stand up for your values, where and when it matters, when you

01:53:53.300 --> 01:53:57.340
have something to lose, then they're not values, and I'm not going to be preached at about

01:53:57.340 --> 01:53:58.340
them by you.

01:53:58.340 --> 01:54:02.400
I'm certainly not going to get preached at when the same fan backlash shit happened to

01:54:02.400 --> 01:54:07.620
Mandalorian actress Gina Carano because she was anti-ACAB during the Summer of Love 2020

01:54:07.620 --> 01:54:09.620
and she lost her fucking job over it.

01:54:09.620 --> 01:54:10.620
Remember that shit?

01:54:10.620 --> 01:54:14.620
Carano did all the things that you don't do as an arm of the Star Wars corporal progressive

01:54:14.620 --> 01:54:15.860
subversion machine.

01:54:15.860 --> 01:54:19.900
Make jokes about masks, talk about her belief in the 2020 election fraud, don't put pronouns

01:54:19.900 --> 01:54:21.820
in your bio, oh my god.

01:54:21.820 --> 01:54:25.340
I think the star that finally broke the camel's back was when she compared hating people for

01:54:25.340 --> 01:54:29.120
their political views to the persecution of Jews from the Holocaust.

01:54:29.120 --> 01:54:31.540
And fair enough, that's pretty fucking spicy, isn't it?

01:54:31.540 --> 01:54:35.580
But hey, how does that one poem go that leftoids always like to cite?

01:54:35.580 --> 01:54:37.420
First they came for the socialists.

01:54:37.420 --> 01:54:42.540
Why isn't this a case of comparing a political affiliation to the persecution of the Jews?

01:54:42.540 --> 01:54:45.540
This is, in fact, something that people on the left always do.

01:54:45.540 --> 01:54:49.180
Compare the persecution of leftist activists to other historical horrors.

01:54:49.180 --> 01:54:53.240
Even though there are just as many historical horrors where leftists come after who they

01:54:53.240 --> 01:54:57.020
deem to be counter-revolutionary or reactionary or whatever.

01:54:57.020 --> 01:55:01.540
It's almost like, despite the obvious hyperbole of Carano's claims, the ultimate issue is

01:55:01.540 --> 01:55:05.800
that only one political camp is allowed the privilege associated with being a victim.

01:55:05.800 --> 01:55:06.860
But you know what?

01:55:06.860 --> 01:55:11.180
Not only did they have no problem at all with Gia Carano before she posted any of the spicy

01:55:11.180 --> 01:55:15.940
stuff, they actually claimed the sexist, racist, toxic fanbase that was Star Wars was

01:55:15.940 --> 01:55:18.940
triggered when she first joined up with the franchise.

01:55:18.940 --> 01:55:19.940
Really?

01:55:19.940 --> 01:55:23.780
The same people who you now claim are her most ardent alt-right supporters or whatever

01:55:23.780 --> 01:55:24.780
the fuck?

01:55:24.780 --> 01:55:26.580
There is nothing these people wouldn't say.

01:55:26.580 --> 01:55:29.420
No lie they wouldn't tell to further their agenda.

01:55:29.420 --> 01:55:31.140
By the way, that alt-right thing?

01:55:31.140 --> 01:55:35.300
It turns out that most of the complaints about The Last Jedi came from the same Twitter accounts

01:55:35.300 --> 01:55:39.740
that were considered Russian bots and plants during the 2016 election, making them all

01:55:39.740 --> 01:55:40.740
part of the alt-right.

01:55:40.740 --> 01:55:44.340
Or maybe average people are just fed up with your shit, Disney.

01:55:44.340 --> 01:55:46.100
You're alt-right if you hate Star Wars.

01:55:46.100 --> 01:55:47.980
It's the fans' fault that Star Wars sucks.

01:55:47.980 --> 01:55:49.340
The Force is female.

01:55:49.340 --> 01:55:52.100
Anakin Skywalker fell because of toxic masculinity.

01:55:52.100 --> 01:55:54.500
Watch the all-female Star Wars or you're a bigot.

01:55:54.500 --> 01:55:56.780
If you negatively review Star Wars, you're a bigot.

01:55:56.780 --> 01:55:59.540
Except Obi-Wan is LGBT or you're a bigot.

01:55:59.540 --> 01:56:01.580
I swear to fucking god.

01:56:01.580 --> 01:56:06.360
Consume product to defeat my cultural enemies regardless of its quality or my personal enjoyment

01:56:06.360 --> 01:56:09.540
of it is the greatest marketing gimmick ever conceived.

01:56:09.540 --> 01:56:13.540
And now they want to do the same thing they did to Gia Carano to Rosario Dawson, the actress

01:56:13.540 --> 01:56:18.180
playing Ahsoka Tano, despite her being quite left-leaning, because at one point a trans

01:56:18.180 --> 01:56:24.900
man filed a lawsuit against her for discrimination, verbal abuse, physical assault, and misgendering.

01:56:24.900 --> 01:56:26.760
I guess that's illegal in California.

01:56:26.760 --> 01:56:30.300
Even though the lawsuit was dropped because there was just nothing fucking to it, people

01:56:30.300 --> 01:56:32.700
still want her out of the Ahsoka show.

01:56:32.700 --> 01:56:37.500
These people are so deep down the rabbit hole that even being innocent of the crime that

01:56:37.500 --> 01:56:39.900
they're accused of is not enough for them.

01:56:39.900 --> 01:56:44.140
Some people are saying that Obi-Wan was purposely brought low in order to pump Riva up and that

01:56:44.140 --> 01:56:45.220
might be the case.

01:56:45.220 --> 01:56:47.620
That doesn't bother me the way that it does a lot of other fans.

01:56:47.620 --> 01:56:51.740
I don't mind a story where an old hero is taken down a peg or two and has to, you know,

01:56:51.740 --> 01:56:52.940
get his mojo back.

01:56:52.940 --> 01:56:54.620
But it has to be justified.

01:56:54.620 --> 01:56:59.060
And in the Obi-Wan show, one of the only things going for it is that Obi-Wan's descent is

01:56:59.060 --> 01:57:00.380
actually pretty justified.

01:57:00.380 --> 01:57:02.660
He's lost everything here and it's all his fault.

01:57:02.660 --> 01:57:06.300
Compare that to The Last Jedi, where with Luke they explicitly avoid fleshing out the

01:57:06.300 --> 01:57:07.300
justification.

01:57:07.300 --> 01:57:11.260
Compare it to Star Trek Discovery, where the beloved character of Spock plays second fiddle

01:57:11.260 --> 01:57:14.900
to his secret until now unknown stepsister Michael Burnham.

01:57:14.900 --> 01:57:18.020
There are many cases where this criticism makes sense, that in order to privilege the

01:57:18.020 --> 01:57:21.860
new characters and stories they want to tell, they just shit all over the established characters.

01:57:21.860 --> 01:57:23.260
But that doesn't work here.

01:57:23.260 --> 01:57:25.120
Obi-Wan's downfall is actually believable.

01:57:25.120 --> 01:57:28.280
I just wish that it was in the service of somebody better than Riva.

01:57:28.280 --> 01:57:30.760
The Star Wars Twitter account is always doing shit like this.

01:57:30.760 --> 01:57:34.900
For example, for Pride Month this year, they released this comic starring two gay chicks

01:57:34.900 --> 01:57:35.900
as bounty hunters.

01:57:35.900 --> 01:57:38.980
Now listen, you know I have no problem with lesbians, that's some pretty good shit.

01:57:38.980 --> 01:57:41.700
But I also have no problem with casual incidental homosexuality.

01:57:41.700 --> 01:57:45.340
Like recently, everyone was losing their mind over the lesbian couple in the Buzz Lightyear

01:57:45.340 --> 01:57:46.700
movie and it's like, who cares?

01:57:46.700 --> 01:57:48.460
They're just chilling, it's whatever.

01:57:48.460 --> 01:57:53.020
I'm even fine with a story about homosexuality specifically, where it's not just incidental

01:57:53.020 --> 01:57:55.820
gayness, but where gayness actually drives the plot.

01:57:55.820 --> 01:58:00.620
One of my favorite anime of all time, the 1997 masterpiece Revolutionary Girl Utena,

01:58:00.620 --> 01:58:04.000
is a show specifically about lesbianism and gender-bending.

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:08.420
It is impossible to do this show's plot without the gay and queer aspects of it.

01:58:08.420 --> 01:58:12.360
It is built from the foundation up to be that type of show, and it's done very well.

01:58:12.360 --> 01:58:13.360
But that's the point.

01:58:13.360 --> 01:58:16.200
Utena is designed to be that story, but Star Wars isn't.

01:58:16.200 --> 01:58:19.560
There's nothing in the fabric of the Star Wars universe that demands queerness.

01:58:19.560 --> 01:58:23.500
Meanwhile, this comic also isn't the incidental gayness of Lightyear either.

01:58:23.500 --> 01:58:27.220
This is not a Star Wars story with Star Wars characters that just so happen to be gay.

01:58:27.220 --> 01:58:30.640
This is a gay story wearing the Star Wars progressive skin suit.

01:58:30.640 --> 01:58:34.360
So of course somebody replies with, don't make Star Wars political.

01:58:34.360 --> 01:58:37.620
Oh, you poor brave soul, F's in the chat.

01:58:37.620 --> 01:58:42.160
The Star Wars official Twitter account replied with, queer characters existing isn't political,

01:58:42.160 --> 01:58:44.260
and Star Wars is literally in our name.

01:58:44.260 --> 01:58:48.160
You know, for a political faction that talks about responsible platforming, use of social

01:58:48.160 --> 01:58:51.960
media, punching down, a faction that I'm sure the Disney intern running the Star Wars

01:58:51.960 --> 01:58:56.140
account is a part of, you'd think they'd know not to sic their huge following on a

01:58:56.140 --> 01:58:57.520
smaller private account.

01:58:57.520 --> 01:58:59.840
Though I'm sure they actually knew exactly what would happen.

01:58:59.840 --> 01:59:02.240
Look at the fucking rage of all these replies.

01:59:02.240 --> 01:59:05.380
Here's another one, calling all members of the Resistance, Billie Lourd and Kelly Marie

01:59:05.380 --> 01:59:06.800
Trainor taking the stage now.

01:59:06.800 --> 01:59:08.880
Respectfully, nobody likes either of them.

01:59:08.880 --> 01:59:13.440
Respectfully, L plus ratio, geez, maybe the Disney intern is actually Kefls.

01:59:13.440 --> 01:59:16.000
And the exact same thing happened to this poor bastard too.

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:18.800
Get his ass, get his ass, get their ass, I guess this one's inclusive.

01:59:18.800 --> 01:59:21.500
Get his ass, get his ass, yeah, let's go, get their ass.

01:59:21.500 --> 01:59:26.040
It's often said by left-oid screeching about right-oid YouTubers or even apolitical YouTubers

01:59:26.040 --> 01:59:30.480
that people in positions of influence online have a moral obligation to tilt their audiences

01:59:30.480 --> 01:59:34.840
towards good behavior and that the harassment that pours out of right-wing communities reflects

01:59:34.840 --> 01:59:37.900
on both the politics and the individuals within those communities.

01:59:37.900 --> 01:59:41.560
If we accept this logic, what does it say about progressive communities that individuals

01:59:41.560 --> 01:59:46.400
within them have no problem being grotesquely racist towards black people who aren't progressive?

01:59:46.400 --> 01:59:49.880
You know, at this point, if you're anti-BLM or something, you're a member of the actual

01:59:49.880 --> 01:59:50.880
Resistance.

01:59:50.880 --> 01:59:52.360
These people are a fucking monolith.

01:59:52.360 --> 01:59:56.760
The most important type of reply out of this officially sanctioned Star Wars dogpile, though,

01:59:56.760 --> 01:59:59.800
were the people who were claiming that Star Wars is actually political.

01:59:59.800 --> 02:00:04.080
And yes, the left-oid answer is the everything-is-political position, stemming out of Antonio Gramsci's

02:00:04.080 --> 02:00:07.840
theory of cultural hegemony, describing how before the working class can revolt against

02:00:07.840 --> 02:00:12.160
the bourgeoisie, first they must be indoctrinated within an alternate culture that is pro-revolution.

02:00:12.160 --> 02:00:16.080
The crafting of that culture requires the subversion of mass media to deconstruct morality

02:00:16.080 --> 02:00:20.360
and heroism for the masses, and within that resulting cultural vacuum, push pro-socialist

02:00:20.360 --> 02:00:21.360
propaganda.

02:00:21.360 --> 02:00:25.240
If you want to know why so many new properties are garbage that promote communism and progressivism,

02:00:25.240 --> 02:00:29.160
while so many reinventions of old properties are simply lessons in how to subvert them,

02:00:29.160 --> 02:00:30.160
this is why.

02:00:30.160 --> 02:00:33.440
Gramsci's time will come on this channel eventually, but for our purposes here, Star

02:00:33.440 --> 02:00:37.640
Wars is political because when George Lucas chose to base his stories on the specific

02:00:37.640 --> 02:00:42.080
hero myths and morals that he did, to a reader of Gramsci, that choice was not a neutral

02:00:42.080 --> 02:00:43.080
one.

02:00:43.080 --> 02:00:45.080
It did not exist within a political or cultural vacuum.

02:00:45.080 --> 02:00:49.920
Rather, it led new generations of people to idolize specific types of heroes, and as those

02:00:49.920 --> 02:00:53.800
children became politically active adults, the particular cultural morality they grew

02:00:53.800 --> 02:00:55.000
up with informed their politics.

02:00:55.000 --> 02:01:01.080
One of the themes of the movie is high technology and romance.

02:01:01.080 --> 02:01:03.560
They're romantic human.

02:01:03.560 --> 02:01:09.280
One of the human qualities is that romantic quality, that quality of honor and justice

02:01:09.280 --> 02:01:15.440
and everything that we equate as human in the way we focus and conduct our lives.

02:01:15.440 --> 02:01:20.520
In this particular case, I was looking for a symbol of sort of a more humane, honorable

02:01:20.520 --> 02:01:27.120
way of being a warrior, as opposed to the mechanical, heartless, machine-like approach

02:01:27.120 --> 02:01:30.260
to killing and battle and war.

02:01:30.260 --> 02:01:34.800
One of the main influences here was the samurai ethic and King Arthur and the King Arthur

02:01:34.800 --> 02:01:40.840
ethic where you have a very strong set of ethical rules that you live by.

02:01:40.840 --> 02:01:46.860
The lightsaber became the symbol of that humane way of conducting your life.

02:01:46.860 --> 02:01:51.080
In this way, Star Wars is political because the progs view it as a vehicle to influence

02:01:51.080 --> 02:01:52.600
political change in the next generation.

02:01:52.600 --> 02:01:56.760
It's not valued by them for the artistry of the thing, but only for its real-world

02:01:56.760 --> 02:01:57.760
impact.

02:01:57.760 --> 02:01:59.320
In other words, it's the progressive skin suit.

02:01:59.320 --> 02:02:03.080
Probably the greatest bulwark against the Gramsciate cultural subversives is literally

02:02:03.080 --> 02:02:04.120
voting with your wallet.

02:02:04.120 --> 02:02:08.520
A piece of media that lacks a soul and only exists to enact political or cultural change

02:02:08.520 --> 02:02:10.300
is generally not of high quality.

02:02:10.340 --> 02:02:14.140
This is the source of the get woke, go broke phenomenon, but it was identified by George

02:02:14.140 --> 02:02:17.060
Lucas as an issue long before that phrase became popular.

02:02:17.060 --> 02:02:20.780
When Star Wars came out, everybody said, oh, it's a silly movie.

02:02:20.780 --> 02:02:24.660
It's just a bunch of space battles and stuff.

02:02:24.660 --> 02:02:25.900
It's not real.

02:02:25.900 --> 02:02:27.020
There's nothing behind it.

02:02:27.020 --> 02:02:29.140
And I said, well, there is stuff behind it.

02:02:29.140 --> 02:02:30.740
It's not just a space battle.

02:02:30.740 --> 02:02:32.260
There's more to it than that.

02:02:32.260 --> 02:02:34.560
It's much, much more complicated than that.

02:02:34.560 --> 02:02:40.880
So the spaceships and that part of the science, fantasy, whatever, got terribly abused.

02:02:40.880 --> 02:02:45.240
And of course, everybody went out and made spaceship movies and they were all horrible

02:02:45.240 --> 02:02:47.160
and they all lost tons of money.

02:02:47.160 --> 02:02:49.220
And you say, well, you know, there's more to it than that.

02:02:49.220 --> 02:02:51.320
You can't just go out and do spaceships.

02:02:51.320 --> 02:02:55.880
Earlier, when I alluded to just how many properties beyond Star Wars have been turned into subversive

02:02:55.880 --> 02:03:00.380
vehicles, you should be able to notice intuitively that they all went through this process.

02:03:00.380 --> 02:03:03.480
The stripping of initial meaning, co-opting of the aesthetic, and the replacement of the

02:03:03.480 --> 02:03:07.900
core with politics and the fans almost always react negatively, which is why the new creators

02:03:07.900 --> 02:03:11.640
attack their fans as a last ditch effort to try and get them in line, which only exacerbates

02:03:11.640 --> 02:03:12.640
the problem.

02:03:12.640 --> 02:03:16.100
But with something as big as popular as Star Wars, where legitimately bad movies still

02:03:16.100 --> 02:03:20.000
turn a profit, the get woke, go broke effect takes some time to build up.

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:23.920
Unlike with, for example, American comics, which are getting absolutely dominated by

02:03:23.920 --> 02:03:27.400
Japanese manga right now, to the point that the industry is collapsing because nobody's

02:03:27.400 --> 02:03:28.480
reading them anymore.

02:03:28.480 --> 02:03:31.520
Star Wars started with enough of a head start that it's going to take more than your average

02:03:31.520 --> 02:03:33.240
failure to kill off the franchise.

02:03:33.240 --> 02:03:36.240
But we've still seen those preliminary symptoms rear their heads.

02:03:36.240 --> 02:03:40.080
Nobody's buying the Rose Tico action figure or whatever else because nobody likes these

02:03:40.080 --> 02:03:41.080
characters.

02:03:41.080 --> 02:03:43.640
The days of this stuff being collectible are over.

02:03:43.640 --> 02:03:48.760
Just a few more strokes and all of the Bubba Fett action figures on Esau will be mine.

02:03:48.760 --> 02:03:49.760
Auction closed.

02:03:49.760 --> 02:03:51.180
Hello, success.

02:03:51.180 --> 02:03:53.200
But there's also a more basic truth here.

02:03:53.200 --> 02:03:57.240
Star Wars is obviously political, and it always was, long before the Prague sunk their hooks

02:03:57.240 --> 02:03:58.240
into it.

02:03:58.240 --> 02:04:01.880
The Star Wars story is about civil war, rebellion against the state, religious persecution,

02:04:01.880 --> 02:04:05.260
persecution of people with immutable traits, economics and the effects of taxation, how

02:04:05.260 --> 02:04:09.180
populism and dismantling bureaucracy can lead to a totalitarian nightmare state, how good

02:04:09.180 --> 02:04:13.140
people are convinced to endorse such a state, and how a crisis can be used to seize political

02:04:13.140 --> 02:04:16.160
power under the guise of temporary emergency measures.

02:04:16.160 --> 02:04:19.640
There is this tendency, exemplified by the you made it political quartering meme, to

02:04:19.640 --> 02:04:23.840
view what is culturally normal as apolitical and what is abnormal as political.

02:04:23.840 --> 02:04:25.700
And some people really take this to the extreme.

02:04:25.700 --> 02:04:29.760
You know, I'm not sure if your average black guy just existing as a political statement,

02:04:29.760 --> 02:04:30.760
my man.

02:04:30.800 --> 02:04:34.640
It's also a Gramscian idea that the dominant culture isn't actually neutral, it's simply

02:04:34.640 --> 02:04:39.080
been normalized, and that a socialist centered culture, once it's normalized, would also

02:04:39.080 --> 02:04:41.000
appear to be neutral to those living within it.

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:42.240
And you know, that's probably true.

02:04:42.240 --> 02:04:46.440
The left's point of view is, when someone says you made it political, what they're actually

02:04:46.440 --> 02:04:49.080
saying is, you made it a type of politics that I don't like.

02:04:49.080 --> 02:04:50.080
And you know what?

02:04:50.080 --> 02:04:51.080
They're correct.

02:04:51.080 --> 02:04:52.080
This is absolutely the case.

02:04:52.080 --> 02:04:54.120
But that's not necessarily a bad thing.

02:04:54.120 --> 02:04:57.600
If you live in a liberal culture, and you value liberalism, and you see a story, like

02:04:57.600 --> 02:05:01.960
say, Star Wars, about a rebellion striving for liberty against an oppressive totalitarian

02:05:01.960 --> 02:05:03.920
empire, that is a liberal story.

02:05:03.920 --> 02:05:05.720
On the surface level, it will appear to be apolitical.

02:05:05.720 --> 02:05:09.240
A quick examination, though, will reveal it to be absolutely political.

02:05:09.240 --> 02:05:13.800
The true complaint here is the subversion of liberal politics is turning Star Wars into

02:05:13.800 --> 02:05:15.240
an anti-liberal story.

02:05:15.240 --> 02:05:16.240
And you know what?

02:05:16.240 --> 02:05:17.520
That's a legitimate complaint, at least to me.

02:05:17.520 --> 02:05:22.800
I have no allegiance to the anti-liberal point of view, but I do object to them taking liberal-aligned

02:05:22.800 --> 02:05:27.400
media and subverting it, even though, when they do, their ethics almost always collapse

02:05:27.400 --> 02:05:28.400
in on themselves.

02:05:28.400 --> 02:05:29.560
Here, let me give you an example.

02:05:29.560 --> 02:05:32.600
One of the best moments in the Obi-Wan show, arguably, was Frak.

02:05:32.600 --> 02:05:34.240
It's pretty clear that Frak's a good guy.

02:05:34.240 --> 02:05:37.400
He likes the stability that the empire's institutions bring to his life.

02:05:37.400 --> 02:05:40.080
His banter with the stormtroopers serves to humanize them both.

02:05:40.080 --> 02:05:43.280
Despite the empire being that totalitarian nightmare state, your average person is just

02:05:43.280 --> 02:05:46.240
doing their job in a system they can't control, and they're just trying to get on with their

02:05:46.240 --> 02:05:48.120
lives and do what they think is the right thing.

02:05:48.120 --> 02:05:53.280
To them, the empire represents security, order, law, trade, jobs, and a bulwark against the

02:05:53.280 --> 02:05:54.740
religious zealotry of the Jedi.

02:05:54.740 --> 02:05:56.840
This dude on Twitter almost gets it.

02:05:56.840 --> 02:05:59.880
This moment was the most real and scary Star Wars has been in a long time.

02:05:59.880 --> 02:06:00.880
Yeah, that's the point.

02:06:00.880 --> 02:06:02.880
Obi-Wan is a wanted man undercover.

02:06:02.880 --> 02:06:05.160
The symbol of the empire should serve to frighten him.

02:06:05.160 --> 02:06:08.400
But the next part of the scene, where Frak and the stormtroopers are humanized, shows

02:06:08.400 --> 02:06:09.400
us the point.

02:06:09.400 --> 02:06:11.360
In a different world, these guys would be friends.

02:06:11.360 --> 02:06:12.440
But then they blow it.

02:06:12.440 --> 02:06:16.920
That's like having a Let's Go Brandon or a Don't Tread On Me bumper sticker on a pickup.

02:06:16.920 --> 02:06:18.760
I mean, just surface level here.

02:06:18.760 --> 02:06:22.920
Despite some of the problems with libertarianism, the libertarian creed of Don't Tread On Me

02:06:22.920 --> 02:06:25.480
is still the exact opposite of the empire's ethics.

02:06:25.480 --> 02:06:27.320
But there's a bigger issue here.

02:06:27.320 --> 02:06:31.520
These people are explicitly ignoring the point of the scene, which is humanizing Obi-Wan's

02:06:31.520 --> 02:06:33.040
enemies before he has to kill them.

02:06:33.040 --> 02:06:36.840
Because they don't accept the idea that their own political opponents should ever

02:06:36.840 --> 02:06:37.840
be humanized.

02:06:37.840 --> 02:06:41.000
I know we're digging back into history now, but remember when Ben Shapiro hosted Mean

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:42.500
Review on PewDiePie's channel?

02:06:42.500 --> 02:06:44.800
Or Donald Trump went on Jimmy Kimmel's show?

02:06:44.800 --> 02:06:48.080
Progressives were screaming bloody murder that these right-leaning people were being

02:06:48.080 --> 02:06:51.140
humanized as if they were not already humans.

02:06:51.140 --> 02:06:55.040
The Prague's rejection of the humanizing moment of this scene shows that they don't

02:06:55.080 --> 02:06:57.520
actually understand the larger Star Wars conflict.

02:06:57.520 --> 02:07:02.060
In their evaluation, there's no moral content here, only the symbols of good and evil.

02:07:02.060 --> 02:07:06.320
If Freck was flying a Pride Month variant of the empire flag off the truck and the narrator

02:07:06.320 --> 02:07:10.200
called the rebellion transphobes or something while Darth Vader was going around choking

02:07:10.200 --> 02:07:14.160
out right-wingers, these idiots would do a complete 180 on this shit.

02:07:14.160 --> 02:07:16.520
They don't want a society free of totalitarianism.

02:07:16.520 --> 02:07:21.360
They want their ideology to be the one enforced by the totalitarian government.

02:07:21.360 --> 02:07:23.360
In fact, okay, Star Wars is political.

02:07:23.360 --> 02:07:24.360
I'm on board.

02:07:24.680 --> 02:07:26.960
What kind of political is Star Wars?

02:07:26.960 --> 02:07:29.840
That question is best answered by going back to the source.

02:07:29.840 --> 02:07:31.800
This line in A New Hope always bothered me.

02:07:31.800 --> 02:07:32.800
It just isn't fair.

02:07:32.800 --> 02:07:33.800
Oh, Biggs is right.

02:07:33.800 --> 02:07:36.760
I'm never going to get out of here.

02:07:36.760 --> 02:07:40.920
So most people know that the Biggs that Luke is referencing is this guy who gets blown

02:07:40.920 --> 02:07:42.500
up during the attack on the Death Star.

02:07:42.500 --> 02:07:45.560
In the original release of the movie, he appears to be just another rebel pilot.

02:07:45.560 --> 02:07:50.200
But in the 1997 special edition, George Lucas added back in a deleted scene showing Luke

02:07:50.200 --> 02:07:53.400
and Biggs reuniting before the battle, where they appear to be old friends who haven't

02:07:53.440 --> 02:07:54.440
seen each other in a while.

02:07:54.440 --> 02:07:55.440
Hey, Luke!

02:07:55.440 --> 02:07:56.440
Biggs!

02:07:56.440 --> 02:07:57.440
I don't believe it!

02:07:57.440 --> 02:07:58.440
Hey!

02:07:58.440 --> 02:07:59.440
How are you?

02:07:59.440 --> 02:08:00.440
Great!

02:08:00.440 --> 02:08:01.440
How'd you get here?

02:08:01.440 --> 02:08:02.440
Hey, you coming up last?

02:08:02.440 --> 02:08:03.440
I'll be right up there with you.

02:08:03.440 --> 02:08:04.440
And have I got stories to tell you?

02:08:04.440 --> 02:08:07.440
You sure you can handle this shit?

02:08:07.440 --> 02:08:10.440
Sir, Luke is the best pushed pilot in the Outer Rim Territories.

02:08:10.440 --> 02:08:12.440
You'll do all right.

02:08:12.440 --> 02:08:13.440
Thank you, sir.

02:08:13.440 --> 02:08:14.440
I'll try.

02:08:14.440 --> 02:08:15.440
I gotta get aboard.

02:08:15.440 --> 02:08:17.440
We'll hear all your stories when we get back, all right?

02:08:17.440 --> 02:08:18.440
All right.

02:08:18.440 --> 02:08:20.440
Hey, Biggs, I told you I'd make it someday.

02:08:20.440 --> 02:08:22.440
It'll be like old times, Luke.

02:08:22.480 --> 02:08:23.480
They'll never stop us.

02:08:24.480 --> 02:08:29.480
Now, the 1997 release was the one that I saw when I was a kid, but even back then, it felt

02:08:29.480 --> 02:08:32.480
like there was some missing setup for Biggs.

02:08:32.480 --> 02:08:33.480
And there was.

02:08:33.480 --> 02:08:37.480
There's a long deleted scene that takes place at Toshi Station, where Luke and his

02:08:37.480 --> 02:08:41.480
group of friends, including Biggs, use binoculars to watch the fight between the Star Destroyer

02:08:41.480 --> 02:08:43.480
and the Counselorship at the beginning of the movie.

02:08:43.480 --> 02:08:47.480
Afterward, Luke has a pretty interesting conversation with Biggs about the trajectory of both of

02:08:47.480 --> 02:08:48.480
their lives.

02:08:48.520 --> 02:08:50.520
I was so close, I thought I was going to fly in my instruments.

02:08:50.520 --> 02:08:52.520
Otherwise, I busted up the Skyhopper pretty bad.

02:08:52.520 --> 02:08:53.520
And I'm all in?

02:08:53.520 --> 02:08:54.520
Furious.

02:08:54.520 --> 02:08:56.520
He wound up grounding me for the rest of the season.

02:08:56.520 --> 02:08:57.520
You should have been there.

02:08:57.520 --> 02:08:58.520
It was fantastic.

02:08:58.520 --> 02:09:00.520
You ought to take it a little easy, Luke.

02:09:00.520 --> 02:09:05.520
You may be the hottest bush pilot this side of Mars Isley, but those little Skyhoppers

02:09:05.520 --> 02:09:06.520
are dangerous.

02:09:06.520 --> 02:09:07.520
Keep it up.

02:09:07.520 --> 02:09:11.520
One day, Whammo, you're going to end up a dark spot on the downside of a canyon wall.

02:09:11.520 --> 02:09:12.520
Look who's talking.

02:09:12.520 --> 02:09:15.520
You've been hanging around the Starfleet so long, you've been sounding like my uncle.

02:09:15.520 --> 02:09:17.520
You know, you're getting a little soft in the city.

02:09:17.560 --> 02:09:21.560
I've missed you, kid.

02:09:21.560 --> 02:09:25.560
Yeah, well, things haven't been the same without you, Biggs.

02:09:25.560 --> 02:09:27.560
It's been so quiet.

02:09:27.560 --> 02:09:32.560
Luke, I didn't come back just to say goodbye.

02:09:32.560 --> 02:09:36.560
I shouldn't tell you this, but you're the only one I can trust.

02:09:36.560 --> 02:09:40.560
See, I may never come back, and I just want someone to know.

02:09:40.560 --> 02:09:43.560
What are you talking about?

02:09:43.600 --> 02:09:46.600
I made some friends at the Academy.

02:09:46.600 --> 02:09:50.600
When our frigate leaves for one of the central systems, we're going to jump ship and join

02:09:50.600 --> 02:09:51.600
the Alliance.

02:09:51.600 --> 02:09:52.600
The Rebellion?

02:09:52.600 --> 02:09:53.600
Quiet down.

02:09:53.600 --> 02:09:54.600
You've got a mouth bigger than a meteor.

02:09:54.600 --> 02:09:55.600
I'm quiet.

02:09:55.600 --> 02:09:56.600
I'm quiet.

02:09:56.600 --> 02:09:57.600
Listen to how quiet I am.

02:09:57.600 --> 02:09:59.600
You can barely hear me.

02:10:01.600 --> 02:10:05.600
My friend has a friend on Bestine who might help us make contact.

02:10:05.600 --> 02:10:06.600
You're crazy.

02:10:06.600 --> 02:10:08.600
You wander around forever trying to find them.

02:10:08.600 --> 02:10:12.600
I know it's a long shot, but if I don't find them, I'll do what I can on my own.

02:10:12.640 --> 02:10:14.640
It's what we always talked about, Luke.

02:10:14.640 --> 02:10:17.640
I'm not going to wait around for the Empire to draft me into service.

02:10:17.640 --> 02:10:21.640
The Rebellion is spreading, and I want to be on the side I believe in.

02:10:21.640 --> 02:10:23.640
Yeah, meanwhile, I'm stuck here.

02:10:23.640 --> 02:10:25.640
You'll get your chance to get off this rock.

02:10:25.640 --> 02:10:27.640
You're going to the Academy next term, aren't you?

02:10:27.640 --> 02:10:28.640
Not likely.

02:10:28.640 --> 02:10:30.640
I had to cancel my application.

02:10:30.640 --> 02:10:31.640
What for?

02:10:31.640 --> 02:10:32.640
My uncle needs me.

02:10:32.640 --> 02:10:33.640
Oh.

02:10:33.640 --> 02:10:34.640
No, I'm serious.

02:10:34.640 --> 02:10:35.640
The Sand People have been getting really crazy.

02:10:35.640 --> 02:10:37.640
They've even raided the outskirts of Anchor Hunt.

02:10:37.640 --> 02:10:38.640
Come on, Luke.

02:10:38.640 --> 02:10:41.640
Your uncle could hold off a whole colony of Sand People with one blaster.

02:10:41.680 --> 02:10:42.680
I know.

02:10:42.680 --> 02:10:45.680
But we've got almost enough evaporators to make the place pay off.

02:10:45.680 --> 02:10:47.680
I have to stay one more season.

02:10:47.680 --> 02:10:48.680
I can't leave him now.

02:10:48.680 --> 02:10:51.680
What good's all your uncle's work if the Empire takes it over?

02:10:51.680 --> 02:10:55.680
You know they've already started to nationalize commerce in the central systems?

02:10:55.680 --> 02:10:58.680
It won't be long before your uncle's just a tenant,

02:10:58.680 --> 02:11:00.680
slaving for the greater glory of the Empire.

02:11:00.680 --> 02:11:02.680
No, that's not going to happen here.

02:11:02.680 --> 02:11:04.680
You said yourself the Empire won't even mess with this old rock.

02:11:04.680 --> 02:11:05.680
Things can change.

02:11:06.680 --> 02:11:07.680
I wish I was going.

02:11:07.680 --> 02:11:09.680
Are you going to be around long?

02:11:09.680 --> 02:11:10.680
No.

02:11:10.720 --> 02:11:11.720
Leaving in the morning.

02:11:12.720 --> 02:11:14.720
I guess I won't see you.

02:11:14.720 --> 02:11:15.720
Maybe someday.

02:11:17.720 --> 02:11:18.720
I'll keep a look at it.

02:11:18.720 --> 02:11:19.720
Yeah.

02:11:19.720 --> 02:11:22.720
I'll be at the Academy next season, and then who knows?

02:11:22.720 --> 02:11:25.720
I won't be drafted into the Imperial Starfleet, that's for sure.

02:11:26.720 --> 02:11:28.720
Well, take it easy, buddy.

02:11:28.720 --> 02:11:30.720
You'll always be the best friend I've ever had.

02:11:30.720 --> 02:11:32.720
So long, Luke.

02:11:40.720 --> 02:11:48.720
Alright, weird ass-pad aside, there's two notable things about this scene.

02:11:48.720 --> 02:11:52.720
First is that to understand Biggs' role in Luke's life, you kind of need this scene.

02:11:52.720 --> 02:11:56.720
Luke's later frustration at Biggs' words now makes a lot more sense.

02:11:56.720 --> 02:12:00.720
Luke's reunion with him at the end of the movie actually carries some weight,

02:12:00.720 --> 02:12:02.720
and Biggs' death actually means something.

02:12:02.720 --> 02:12:07.720
I'm guessing these scenes were left out because George Lucas wanted to tightly follow R2-D2 in C-3PO

02:12:07.720 --> 02:12:09.720
until they joined up with Luke and Obi-Wan.

02:12:09.760 --> 02:12:15.760
The first cut of the film had the intercuts of Luke on the planet with what was going on in space,

02:12:15.760 --> 02:12:18.760
but it just wasn't the movie I wanted to make.

02:12:18.760 --> 02:12:23.760
I wanted to make it about this kind of odd couple and tell the story from their point of view.

02:12:23.760 --> 02:12:26.760
But man, working them in somehow would have improved the movie quite a bit.

02:12:26.760 --> 02:12:29.760
But secondly, there's also the political component of Biggs' speech.

02:12:29.760 --> 02:12:32.760
Biggs states that the Empire has been nationalizing businesses,

02:12:32.760 --> 02:12:36.760
and that the former owners of those businesses become tenants of the Empire.

02:12:36.800 --> 02:12:41.800
His dialogue crafts a link between the idea of nationalization and the idea of landlordship,

02:12:41.800 --> 02:12:44.800
where being a renter is the same as being a government employee,

02:12:44.800 --> 02:12:48.800
and the thing that links them is the lack of personal ownership.

02:12:48.800 --> 02:12:51.800
Biggs also makes it sound like it's at least somewhat common

02:12:51.800 --> 02:12:54.800
for young people to join the Imperial Academy to get training,

02:12:54.800 --> 02:12:56.800
and then defect the Rebellion when they get a chance.

02:12:56.800 --> 02:12:59.800
Now, the Empire is obviously supposed to be a stand-in for Nazi Germany.

02:12:59.800 --> 02:13:02.800
The historical stormtroopers, from which the Imperial stormtroopers get their name,

02:13:02.840 --> 02:13:06.840
were the Brownshirts, the Nazi Party's paramilitary wing in its early years.

02:13:06.840 --> 02:13:11.840
Demographically, the Brownshirts were overwhelmingly young working-class communist-aligned men

02:13:11.840 --> 02:13:14.840
who believed that national socialism could be an alternate path forward

02:13:14.840 --> 02:13:17.840
for the socialist movement instead of the communist international.

02:13:17.840 --> 02:13:22.840
Nowadays, the idea that fascism is capitalism in decay is one that the left clings to,

02:13:22.840 --> 02:13:24.840
despite it being resoundingly false.

02:13:24.840 --> 02:13:27.840
A fascist totalitarian government rolling in, pointing guns at you,

02:13:27.840 --> 02:13:30.840
and telling you that you work for them now, that's not capitalism.

02:13:30.840 --> 02:13:31.840
In fact, that's the opposite of it.

02:13:31.880 --> 02:13:35.880
But back in 1977, when A New Hope came out, World War II wasn't so old,

02:13:35.880 --> 02:13:38.880
and academia hadn't yet been completely subverted,

02:13:38.880 --> 02:13:41.880
such that multiple generations of people no longer understood how politics worked.

02:13:41.880 --> 02:13:45.880
People back then knew that fascism was socialism in decay,

02:13:45.880 --> 02:13:47.880
even if they didn't use that language to say it.

02:13:47.880 --> 02:13:50.880
And this knowledge was reflected in the political undertones of the pop culture of the time.

02:13:50.880 --> 02:13:52.880
Here, let me use another example.

02:13:52.880 --> 02:13:54.880
I don't commonly get into Archie comics on this channel.

02:13:54.880 --> 02:13:58.880
He's not so popular now, but he was a pretty big deal in the early post-war period.

02:13:58.920 --> 02:14:02.920
There's a story that was printed first in 1972 called Mark My Words,

02:14:02.920 --> 02:14:05.920
where Archie has a brand new set of markers that are stolen from him,

02:14:05.920 --> 02:14:07.920
and then graffiti is drawn all over the school with the markers.

02:14:07.920 --> 02:14:10.920
This was back in 72, remember? Markers were invented in 1953.

02:14:10.920 --> 02:14:13.920
Getting a hold of them was easy enough, but they were considered specialized tools,

02:14:13.920 --> 02:14:16.920
not something that everyone would have just lying around their house like today.

02:14:16.920 --> 02:14:19.920
So, Principal Weatherby naturally blames Archie for the graffiti,

02:14:19.920 --> 02:14:23.920
and then in response, the other students casually declare Weatherby a fascist.

02:14:23.920 --> 02:14:26.920
They then say that the downtrodden rising up

02:14:26.960 --> 02:14:29.960
would require the student body to make more and worse graffiti.

02:14:29.960 --> 02:14:32.960
Archie stops them and says that even if he didn't do it,

02:14:32.960 --> 02:14:34.960
suspecting him isn't unreasonable given the evidence,

02:14:34.960 --> 02:14:36.960
and if they really wanted to help fix the situation,

02:14:36.960 --> 02:14:38.960
they should help him clean the mess.

02:14:38.960 --> 02:14:42.960
And it's this show of virtue that convinces the principal that Archie is actually innocent.

02:14:42.960 --> 02:14:46.960
Now, I'm not here telling you to get your serious political analysis from Archie comics,

02:14:46.960 --> 02:14:49.960
nor am I saying that this comic presents the true fascism or whatever.

02:14:49.960 --> 02:14:52.960
What I am saying is, when I first read this comic,

02:14:52.960 --> 02:14:54.960
I was surprised at the use of the term.

02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:59.000
In today's pop media, it's so often the case that if fascism is brought up,

02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:02.000
it's done to point fingers at the right, even the libertarian right.

02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:04.000
But here, that's clearly not the context.

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:08.000
Here, it's done to point fingers at legitimate authority that has made a mistake.

02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:10.000
And their prescription for fixing the situation

02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:13.000
is to actually do the thing they were mistaken for doing.

02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:15.000
The ethic this story is exemplifying for the reader

02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:17.000
is that even in the face of injustice,

02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:20.000
the best thing you can do is act virtuous.

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:24.000
The people who wrongly call Weatherby a fascist aren't rewarded for doing so.

02:15:24.040 --> 02:15:26.040
They're vilified for exacerbating the situation.

02:15:26.040 --> 02:15:30.040
In a more general sense, there was a broad understanding by people of this era

02:15:30.040 --> 02:15:33.040
that socialism and fascism were feuding brothers,

02:15:33.040 --> 02:15:36.040
and that each of their reactions to the other made society worse.

02:15:36.040 --> 02:15:39.040
While it was liberal democracy standing apart from the two

02:15:39.040 --> 02:15:41.040
from a totally different political school of thought

02:15:41.040 --> 02:15:44.040
that truly had an alternative, more constructive path forward.

02:15:44.040 --> 02:15:48.040
And this can also be seen in the political science writing of this era as well.

02:15:48.040 --> 02:15:50.040
Before the Soviets had begun infiltrating Western universities

02:15:50.040 --> 02:15:52.040
with their active measures program,

02:15:52.080 --> 02:15:54.080
you had papers like, for example,

02:15:54.080 --> 02:15:57.080
A Premature Fascist, Sorelle and Mussolini by James Meisel,

02:15:57.080 --> 02:15:59.080
which documents the clear ideological progression

02:15:59.080 --> 02:16:02.080
from the socialism of French syndicalist George Sorelle

02:16:02.080 --> 02:16:05.080
to the neo-socialism and later fascism of Benito Mussolini.

02:16:05.080 --> 02:16:08.080
With this knowledge, let's return to the cut scenes from Star Wars and New Hope.

02:16:08.080 --> 02:16:12.080
Biggs' assertion that nationalization leads to everyone becoming tenants

02:16:12.080 --> 02:16:14.080
where nobody truly owns their own means of production

02:16:14.080 --> 02:16:16.080
in an exclusive individualistic manner

02:16:16.080 --> 02:16:18.080
and the collective dictates to the individual

02:16:18.080 --> 02:16:20.080
what is the greater good for the people.

02:16:20.120 --> 02:16:23.120
That principle is the handshake between socialism and fascism.

02:16:23.120 --> 02:16:26.120
Meanwhile, in the Wild West environment that is Tatooine,

02:16:26.120 --> 02:16:28.120
with all of its many problems,

02:16:28.120 --> 02:16:31.120
there's still ultimately more freedom there than within the empire.

02:16:31.120 --> 02:16:34.120
The small landowners and businessmen who exclusively own property,

02:16:34.120 --> 02:16:37.120
they're less well-off materially than the citizens of the core worlds,

02:16:37.120 --> 02:16:39.120
but they're free, at least for now,

02:16:39.120 --> 02:16:40.120
and they want to keep it that way.

02:16:40.120 --> 02:16:43.120
The rebellion is a liberal individualistic uprising

02:16:43.120 --> 02:16:45.120
against a socialist system in decay

02:16:45.120 --> 02:16:47.120
and George Lucas wrote that story

02:16:47.120 --> 02:16:49.120
within the context of a larger cultural backdrop

02:16:49.160 --> 02:16:51.160
that still understood the natural progression

02:16:51.160 --> 02:16:53.160
between a socialist revolution and a fascist state.

02:16:53.160 --> 02:16:56.160
Now, maybe you might say that deleted scenes don't count.

02:16:56.160 --> 02:16:58.160
They don't really represent what Star Wars is all about

02:16:58.160 --> 02:17:00.160
because they were, you know, deleted.

02:17:00.160 --> 02:17:03.160
And so, not only their plot points but their underlying morals

02:17:03.160 --> 02:17:05.160
should be disregarded.

02:17:05.160 --> 02:17:08.160
The problem is, Biggs' speech slots in quite well

02:17:08.160 --> 02:17:10.160
to what we know about the empire's economy,

02:17:10.160 --> 02:17:13.160
as told on screen in The Empire Strikes Back.

02:17:13.160 --> 02:17:15.160
So you see, since we're a small operation,

02:17:15.160 --> 02:17:18.160
we don't fall into the jurisdiction of the empire.

02:17:18.200 --> 02:17:20.200
So you're part of the mining guild then?

02:17:20.200 --> 02:17:21.200
No, not actually.

02:17:21.200 --> 02:17:23.200
Our operation is small enough not to be noticed.

02:17:23.200 --> 02:17:26.200
Fascist political theory describes what they called

02:17:26.200 --> 02:17:27.200
a corporative economy,

02:17:27.200 --> 02:17:30.200
where guild-like bodies, called corporations,

02:17:30.200 --> 02:17:33.200
would bring together the managers of government-led business

02:17:33.200 --> 02:17:35.200
and representatives from nationalized unions

02:17:35.200 --> 02:17:38.200
to determine how best to implement state policy.

02:17:38.200 --> 02:17:40.200
In this scene, Lando is expressing gratitude

02:17:40.200 --> 02:17:43.200
that his business is small enough not to be nationalized

02:17:43.200 --> 02:17:45.200
in the way that Biggs described

02:17:45.200 --> 02:17:47.200
under the jurisdiction of the mining guild.

02:17:47.240 --> 02:17:48.240
And later in the movie,

02:17:48.240 --> 02:17:51.240
the empire does actually roll in and take over the business

02:17:51.240 --> 02:17:54.240
because Han and Leia's presence shines a spotlight on them,

02:17:54.240 --> 02:17:55.240
just like how, in reality,

02:17:55.240 --> 02:17:58.240
fascists would march into businesses, point guns at them,

02:17:58.240 --> 02:17:59.240
and tell them that they work for the state now.

02:17:59.240 --> 02:18:02.240
Again, this is not capitalism in decay.

02:18:02.240 --> 02:18:03.240
It is, in fact, state socialism.

02:18:03.240 --> 02:18:06.240
That idea is disproven on the very first page

02:18:06.240 --> 02:18:08.240
of the book Hitler's Beneficiaries

02:18:08.240 --> 02:18:10.240
by German historian Goetz Ali.

02:18:10.240 --> 02:18:12.240
Ali describes the efforts of Stuart Elliot Eisenstadt,

02:18:12.240 --> 02:18:14.240
an American who has spent much of his life

02:18:14.240 --> 02:18:16.240
negotiating reparations for victims of the Holocaust.

02:18:16.280 --> 02:18:18.280
In fact, he's been the federal government special advisor

02:18:18.280 --> 02:18:21.280
on Holocaust issues under Obama, Trump, and Biden.

02:18:21.280 --> 02:18:24.280
Part of Eisenstadt's work involved securing compensation

02:18:24.280 --> 02:18:26.280
from private German businesses

02:18:26.280 --> 02:18:28.280
that profited off of Nazi slave labor.

02:18:28.280 --> 02:18:29.280
And Ali immediately agrees

02:18:29.280 --> 02:18:32.280
that Eisenstadt was fully in the right to pursue damages.

02:18:32.280 --> 02:18:33.280
But despite this,

02:18:33.280 --> 02:18:36.280
Eisenstadt's highly public negotiations with these companies,

02:18:36.280 --> 02:18:39.280
widely publicized in the media in the 1990s and early 2000s,

02:18:39.280 --> 02:18:41.280
led to a distorted view

02:18:41.280 --> 02:18:44.280
of just how complicit German captains of industry were

02:18:44.280 --> 02:18:45.280
in the horrors of the Nazi regime.

02:18:45.320 --> 02:18:47.320
The Nazis had no problem pointing their guns

02:18:47.320 --> 02:18:49.320
and making demands of private owners of business

02:18:49.320 --> 02:18:50.320
if it meant getting what they want,

02:18:50.320 --> 02:18:53.320
a fact that first came out during the Nuremberg Trials.

02:18:53.320 --> 02:18:56.320
And while German industry is responsible for what it did,

02:18:56.320 --> 02:18:58.320
it's also important to recognize

02:18:58.320 --> 02:19:00.320
how little of a choice the individuals involved had.

02:19:00.320 --> 02:19:03.320
But that nuance doesn't work very well as a headline.

02:19:03.320 --> 02:19:05.320
And even back then, headlines are all that people read.

02:19:05.320 --> 02:19:07.320
But none of this context would be alien

02:19:07.320 --> 02:19:09.320
to Star Wars viewers of the 1970s or 80s

02:19:09.320 --> 02:19:13.320
who didn't exist within a wider culture of leftist academics,

02:19:13.360 --> 02:19:15.360
successfully subverting the knowledge

02:19:15.360 --> 02:19:17.360
of what fascism actually is,

02:19:17.360 --> 02:19:19.360
and replacing it with that false notion

02:19:19.360 --> 02:19:21.360
that fascism is capitalism in decay.

02:19:21.360 --> 02:19:24.360
So, the idea that fascism is capitalism in decay

02:19:24.360 --> 02:19:27.360
was ultimately spread by neo-Marxist academics,

02:19:27.360 --> 02:19:29.360
following the cultural theory of Antonio Gramsci,

02:19:29.360 --> 02:19:32.360
who successfully dismantled our previous cultural understanding

02:19:32.360 --> 02:19:35.360
of the links between socialism and fascism

02:19:35.360 --> 02:19:38.360
as a part of a multi-decade project of Soviet subversion.

02:19:38.360 --> 02:19:40.360
They then replaced that previous knowledge

02:19:40.360 --> 02:19:41.360
with a new theory

02:19:41.400 --> 02:19:43.400
that corporations are themselves fascist,

02:19:43.400 --> 02:19:46.400
relying on the modern definition of the word corporation

02:19:46.400 --> 02:19:49.400
and ignoring the very different definition from the 1920s

02:19:49.400 --> 02:19:51.400
when Mussolini was actually writing about the corporative state

02:19:51.400 --> 02:19:53.400
as part of fascist political theory,

02:19:53.400 --> 02:19:55.400
and then backed up their new construction

02:19:55.400 --> 02:19:57.400
by misinterpreting Eisenstadt's good work.

02:19:57.400 --> 02:20:00.400
Now then, because Star Wars is political,

02:20:00.400 --> 02:20:02.400
we can go back to the original movies

02:20:02.400 --> 02:20:04.400
where the broad cultural understanding

02:20:04.400 --> 02:20:06.400
of the true nature of socialism is still intact

02:20:06.400 --> 02:20:08.400
and see that understanding shine through in the narrative.

02:20:08.400 --> 02:20:10.400
Afterward, we can go to the newest movies

02:20:10.440 --> 02:20:12.440
witness the end result of progressive subversion

02:20:12.440 --> 02:20:15.440
and notice how all the ethics, all the morals, all the heroism

02:20:15.440 --> 02:20:17.440
has been entirely flipped on its head

02:20:17.440 --> 02:20:19.440
and how that roughly corresponds

02:20:19.440 --> 02:20:21.440
with the loss of broader political knowledge

02:20:21.440 --> 02:20:23.440
regarding socialism's true nature.

02:20:23.440 --> 02:20:25.440
But, if a progressive were to hear that analysis

02:20:25.440 --> 02:20:27.440
about how Star Wars is political,

02:20:27.440 --> 02:20:29.440
I would be labeled a racist, bigoted, boot-licking chud

02:20:29.440 --> 02:20:31.440
who is too stupid to understand politics

02:20:31.440 --> 02:20:33.440
and I'm taking Star Wars too seriously and...

02:20:33.440 --> 02:20:35.440
Don't ask questions, just consume product

02:20:35.440 --> 02:20:37.440
and then get excited for next product.

02:20:37.440 --> 02:20:39.440
Yeah, that.

02:20:39.440 --> 02:20:41.440
The honest truth is, everything can be political

02:20:41.440 --> 02:20:43.440
Prague's are right about that

02:20:43.440 --> 02:20:45.440
but it's an active choice to politicize something.

02:20:45.440 --> 02:20:47.440
All of these political interpretations of Star Wars

02:20:47.440 --> 02:20:49.440
they're all valid

02:20:49.440 --> 02:20:51.440
but you can also just shut your brain off

02:20:51.440 --> 02:20:53.440
and watch the movie if you like.

02:20:53.440 --> 02:20:55.440
And that's just as valid a choice

02:20:55.440 --> 02:20:57.440
because its purpose is entertainment, not cultural change

02:20:57.440 --> 02:20:59.440
no matter what a gramtiate might tell you.

02:20:59.440 --> 02:21:01.440
Let's say, for example, there was a Star Wars club

02:21:01.440 --> 02:21:03.440
at your university or something.

02:21:03.440 --> 02:21:05.440
I don't know what you kids do nowadays.

02:21:05.440 --> 02:21:07.440
And let's say that there was a club rule to keep politics at the door.

02:21:07.440 --> 02:21:09.440
And let's say some whining Prague

02:21:09.440 --> 02:21:11.440
said this rule was unfair because Star Wars is political.

02:21:11.440 --> 02:21:13.440
The correct response is to say

02:21:13.440 --> 02:21:15.440
maybe so, but this space isn't.

02:21:15.440 --> 02:21:17.440
Political neutrality cannot simply be assumed anymore.

02:21:17.440 --> 02:21:19.440
There's too many subversives in the West right now.

02:21:19.440 --> 02:21:21.440
It has to be actively enforced

02:21:21.440 --> 02:21:23.440
as a moral good in its own right.

02:21:23.440 --> 02:21:25.440
And the reason it is a good

02:21:25.440 --> 02:21:27.440
is because a neutral space is the only place

02:21:27.440 --> 02:21:29.440
where ideas can truly be explored

02:21:29.440 --> 02:21:31.440
where new things can truly be invented.

02:21:31.440 --> 02:21:33.440
In a world where every space is a socialist space

02:21:33.440 --> 02:21:35.440
it wouldn't be possible to explore ideas

02:21:35.440 --> 02:21:37.440
beyond socialism.

02:21:37.440 --> 02:21:39.440
Which is, by the way, the point of what they're doing.

02:21:39.440 --> 02:21:41.440
Building the cultural hegemony that I've been talking about

02:21:41.440 --> 02:21:43.440
for the past half hour.

02:21:43.440 --> 02:21:45.440
If you want to know what that process looks like

02:21:45.440 --> 02:21:47.440
all you have to do is look around.

02:21:47.440 --> 02:21:49.440
The subversion of Star Wars

02:21:49.440 --> 02:21:51.440
the loss of old political knowledge

02:21:51.440 --> 02:21:53.440
for the sake of the Left's expediency

02:21:53.440 --> 02:21:55.440
that's only one symptom among many.

02:21:55.440 --> 02:21:57.440
The bland, grey, lifeless, algorithmic sludge

02:21:57.440 --> 02:21:59.440
is the product of that cultural hegemony.

02:21:59.440 --> 02:22:01.440
Where because everyone's views are enshrined

02:22:01.440 --> 02:22:03.440
no prescriptions can be made.

02:22:03.440 --> 02:22:05.440
Nobody can get offended.

02:22:05.440 --> 02:22:07.440
And there is only a facsimile of emotional impact.

02:22:07.440 --> 02:22:09.440
With this understanding, let's look at the wider culture.

02:22:09.440 --> 02:22:11.440
Here's an advertisement from a theatre back in the day.

02:22:11.440 --> 02:22:13.440
Compare that to this schedule from an AMC in Times Square

02:22:13.440 --> 02:22:15.440
showing 70 different screenings of Doctor Strange.

02:22:15.440 --> 02:22:17.440
The Contemporary Music Super Study

02:22:17.440 --> 02:22:19.440
has shown that overall

02:22:19.440 --> 02:22:21.440
the number one song since 2017

02:22:21.440 --> 02:22:23.440
has been Ed Sheeran's Shape of You

02:22:23.440 --> 02:22:25.440
every single year for the past five years.

02:22:25.440 --> 02:22:27.440
It's funny, but that song is generic as fuck.

02:22:27.440 --> 02:22:29.440
UMG, Warner, and Sony

02:22:29.440 --> 02:22:31.440
control the content on Spotify.

02:22:31.440 --> 02:22:33.440
Every alt, counterculture, rebellious song

02:22:33.440 --> 02:22:35.440
about smashing the system or raging against the machine

02:22:35.440 --> 02:22:37.440
is now owned by a hedge fund.

02:22:37.440 --> 02:22:39.440
The consolidation of news media

02:22:39.440 --> 02:22:41.440
is continuing at a breakneck pace.

02:22:41.440 --> 02:22:43.440
The biggest upcoming films are simply rehashes

02:22:43.440 --> 02:22:45.440
of big films from the past

02:22:45.440 --> 02:22:47.440
and elite awards for creativity

02:22:47.440 --> 02:22:49.440
are dominated by these rehashes.

02:22:49.440 --> 02:22:51.440
In online streaming, niche options are gradually pruned away

02:22:51.440 --> 02:22:53.440
and suggestions push people towards the mainstream

02:22:53.440 --> 02:22:55.440
including platforms like Netflix

02:22:55.440 --> 02:22:57.440
and user-generated platforms like YouTube.

02:22:57.440 --> 02:22:59.440
In book publishing, five companies control the market.

02:22:59.440 --> 02:23:01.440
In all creative industries

02:23:01.440 --> 02:23:03.440
the banal word of content

02:23:03.440 --> 02:23:05.440
is used to describe every single type of creative work

02:23:05.440 --> 02:23:07.440
with the implication that artistry

02:23:07.440 --> 02:23:09.440
is generic and interchangeable.

02:23:09.440 --> 02:23:11.440
It's no longer books and movies and TV shows and video games

02:23:11.440 --> 02:23:13.440
and YouTube videos. It's all just content

02:23:13.440 --> 02:23:15.440
something for you to consume.

02:23:15.440 --> 02:23:17.440
Leftoids may look at this wider state of cultural affairs

02:23:17.440 --> 02:23:19.440
and claim this is the natural end stage of capitalism

02:23:19.440 --> 02:23:21.440
monopolies consolidating and corporate power

02:23:21.440 --> 02:23:23.440
and making profit to the point of destroying the market.

02:23:23.440 --> 02:23:25.440
And fair enough, that's probably part of it.

02:23:25.440 --> 02:23:27.440
But the issue is, this is the Left's capitalism.

02:23:27.440 --> 02:23:29.440
The thematic elements of all of this content

02:23:29.440 --> 02:23:31.440
as I have gone to great pains to show in this video

02:23:31.440 --> 02:23:33.440
is radically pro-left

02:23:33.440 --> 02:23:35.440
pro-progressive, anti-capitalist

02:23:35.440 --> 02:23:37.440
anti-cop, pro-revolution

02:23:37.440 --> 02:23:39.440
academia is also radically pro-left

02:23:39.440 --> 02:23:41.440
and out of that environment comes cultural studies

02:23:41.440 --> 02:23:43.440
where the well-educated

02:23:43.440 --> 02:23:45.440
left-leaning ivory tower elitist

02:23:45.440 --> 02:23:47.440
is given the job of properly interpreting culture

02:23:47.440 --> 02:23:49.440
so that the masses may consume it

02:23:49.440 --> 02:23:51.440
in the correct progressive approved way

02:23:51.440 --> 02:23:53.440
in much the same way that back in the day

02:23:53.440 --> 02:23:55.440
only priests knew Latin and could read the Bible

02:23:55.440 --> 02:23:57.440
while commoners simply had to listen to them.

02:23:57.440 --> 02:23:59.440
Despite the claim that the Left's ethics

02:23:59.440 --> 02:24:01.440
is centered on supporting the working class against the bourgeoisie

02:24:01.440 --> 02:24:03.440
the Left's elitism shows that

02:24:03.440 --> 02:24:05.440
they desire to be the bourgeoisie

02:24:05.440 --> 02:24:07.440
that indoctrinates the working class

02:24:07.440 --> 02:24:09.440
in the correct way of doing politics.

02:24:09.440 --> 02:24:11.440
The Left's cultural victory as well as their continued

02:24:11.440 --> 02:24:13.440
insistence that they are still the counter-culture

02:24:13.440 --> 02:24:15.440
has created a very strange monoculture

02:24:15.440 --> 02:24:17.440
where there is no real alt-culture

02:24:17.440 --> 02:24:19.440
where action and reaction have been

02:24:19.440 --> 02:24:21.440
synthesized into one amalgamation

02:24:21.440 --> 02:24:23.440
where the cultural hegemony has expanded across everything

02:24:23.440 --> 02:24:25.440
and become a totalizing ideology

02:24:25.440 --> 02:24:27.440
the creative world feels bankrupt

02:24:27.440 --> 02:24:29.440
there's a sense of sameness in everything

02:24:29.440 --> 02:24:31.440
nobody can be offended so nothing can be interesting

02:24:31.440 --> 02:24:33.440
and this perpetual limitation is rewarded

02:24:33.440 --> 02:24:35.440
while some alternative voices might exist

02:24:35.440 --> 02:24:37.440
they never truly break through anymore

02:24:37.440 --> 02:24:39.440
their cultural impact is zero

02:24:39.440 --> 02:24:41.440
we now exist under an overarching

02:24:41.440 --> 02:24:43.440
totalitarian cultural hegemony

02:24:43.440 --> 02:24:45.440
that actively pushes progressive politics

02:24:45.440 --> 02:24:47.440
into every possible space

02:24:47.440 --> 02:24:49.440
because neutral ground is viewed as simply

02:24:49.440 --> 02:24:51.440
another opportunity to create the next

02:24:51.440 --> 02:24:53.440
generation of young revolutionaries

02:24:53.440 --> 02:24:55.440
it is for this reason that Progs treat

02:24:55.440 --> 02:24:57.440
centrists or politically disengaged people

02:24:57.440 --> 02:24:59.440
the same way they treat those who actively

02:24:59.440 --> 02:25:01.440
hold different politics than they do

02:25:01.440 --> 02:25:03.440
and Star Wars, having been stripped of all of its meaning

02:25:03.440 --> 02:25:05.440
now only exists as a tool

02:25:05.440 --> 02:25:07.440
of this process.

02:25:07.440 --> 02:25:09.440
You know, I think this might be the end of

02:25:09.440 --> 02:25:11.440
Star Wars for me.

02:25:11.440 --> 02:25:13.440
Now that I've finally done this video

02:25:13.440 --> 02:25:15.440
I've got four hours of recorded content for this video

02:25:15.440 --> 02:25:17.440
I know it'll be trimmed down in post

02:25:17.440 --> 02:25:19.440
but I've been here a while. But now that I'm done

02:25:19.440 --> 02:25:21.440
I think I've said everything that I want

02:25:21.440 --> 02:25:23.440
to say about Star Wars. It feels like

02:25:23.440 --> 02:25:25.440
this is my goodbye. I really liked the original trilogy

02:25:25.440 --> 02:25:27.440
as a kid, and I was young enough to not be able to see

02:25:27.440 --> 02:25:29.440
the glaring flaws of the prequels. It was just

02:25:29.440 --> 02:25:31.440
fun to be along for the ride, you know? I didn't understand

02:25:31.440 --> 02:25:33.440
that Star Wars was, at its heart, a morality

02:25:33.440 --> 02:25:35.440
play, but that's okay. We absorb ethics

02:25:35.440 --> 02:25:37.440
even if we don't recognize them, and that's what

02:25:37.440 --> 02:25:39.440
subversives are hoping for. I was hopeful

02:25:39.440 --> 02:25:41.440
yet worried with The Force Awakens. I was

02:25:41.440 --> 02:25:43.440
flexed and disgusted with The Last Jedi, and I was

02:25:43.440 --> 02:25:45.440
resigned with The Rise of Skywalker. The first season

02:25:45.440 --> 02:25:47.440
of The Mandalorian was legitimately good, but then

02:25:47.440 --> 02:25:49.440
Disney desperately hitched like ten fucking

02:25:49.440 --> 02:25:51.440
properties to the second season and ruined it.

02:25:51.440 --> 02:25:53.440
And at this point, with Kenobi, my

02:25:53.440 --> 02:25:55.440
grieving process is over. The soul

02:25:55.440 --> 02:25:57.440
of Star Wars is gone, replaced by an

02:25:57.440 --> 02:25:59.440
algorithm. I'll probably still watch some stuff

02:25:59.440 --> 02:26:01.440
if only to make fun of it with my friends. I'll pirate

02:26:01.440 --> 02:26:03.440
it, of course. But Star Wars is no

02:26:03.440 --> 02:26:05.440
longer the once-in-a-generation cultural phenomenon

02:26:05.440 --> 02:26:07.440
that it once was. At least not to me.

02:26:07.440 --> 02:26:09.440
And it's because of what Disney has done to it.

02:26:09.440 --> 02:26:11.440
They've stripped out what made Star Wars

02:26:11.440 --> 02:26:13.440
Star Wars, and replaced it with progressive activism.

02:26:13.440 --> 02:26:15.440
And I'm just not here for that. I'm getting older.

02:26:15.440 --> 02:26:17.440
My time on this planet is running out. All of

02:26:17.440 --> 02:26:19.440
ours is. And I just don't want to

02:26:19.440 --> 02:26:21.440
waste my limited attention caring about

02:26:21.440 --> 02:26:23.440
a thing that they clearly don't care about

02:26:23.440 --> 02:26:25.440
themselves.

02:26:39.440 --> 02:26:41.440
If you look at my channel's release schedule,

02:26:41.440 --> 02:26:43.440
you should probably notice that I put out a video

02:26:43.440 --> 02:26:45.440
or I did a stream or something for every day

02:26:45.440 --> 02:26:47.440
in July. I committed myself to once a day

02:26:47.440 --> 02:26:49.440
on SFO for a month, and I did it.

02:26:49.440 --> 02:26:51.440
Even if a couple videos were jokey ones, like my

02:26:51.440 --> 02:26:53.440
editor's a communist or whatever. There was still

02:26:53.440 --> 02:26:55.440
one piece of SFO content every day.

02:26:55.440 --> 02:26:57.440
But even while I was doing that, I was still spending

02:26:57.440 --> 02:26:59.440
like an hour a day working on the Kenobi review.

02:26:59.440 --> 02:27:01.440
As the end of July approached, I only had

02:27:01.440 --> 02:27:03.440
like half the script written. And I realized if I didn't

02:27:03.440 --> 02:27:05.440
knuckle down and devote some real time to this video,

02:27:05.440 --> 02:27:07.440
it was just never going to come out. At least,

02:27:07.440 --> 02:27:09.440
not in any timely way. So you

02:27:09.440 --> 02:27:11.440
should also notice that my release schedule in August

02:27:11.440 --> 02:27:13.440
has been absolutely nothing at all.

02:27:13.440 --> 02:27:15.440
TUBCASTS and Weekly Sips came out, but

02:27:15.440 --> 02:27:17.440
beyond that, I've been pretty much radio silence.

02:27:17.440 --> 02:27:19.440
On Discord, on Twitter, everywhere.

02:27:19.440 --> 02:27:21.440
I've done almost nothing but work on

02:27:21.440 --> 02:27:23.440
Kenobi this whole time. Wake up, work,

02:27:23.440 --> 02:27:25.440
eat, sleep. For nearly two weeks

02:27:25.440 --> 02:27:27.440
now. We're talking like 12

02:27:27.440 --> 02:27:29.440
to 16 hour days. And as I worked,

02:27:29.440 --> 02:27:31.440
I realized this had to be about Star Wars, not

02:27:31.440 --> 02:27:33.440
just Kenobi. I couldn't say what I wanted to say

02:27:33.440 --> 02:27:35.440
using only Kenobi. It had to be broader than that.

02:27:35.440 --> 02:27:37.440
Which is why the video opens up in the second half.

02:27:37.440 --> 02:27:39.440
It was actually pretty grueling doing something

02:27:39.440 --> 02:27:41.440
this big, I'm not going to lie. I don't think I'm going to

02:27:41.440 --> 02:27:43.440
attempt anything quite so in-depth

02:27:43.440 --> 02:27:45.440
again. Not without a sponsor for the video

02:27:45.440 --> 02:27:47.440
or I have the money to hire support staff or

02:27:47.440 --> 02:27:49.440
something. I enjoy doing it. I don't regret

02:27:49.440 --> 02:27:51.440
doing it. But I do feel like it's taken a little bit out of

02:27:51.440 --> 02:27:53.440
me. Also, I highly doubt that Disney's going to let

02:27:53.440 --> 02:27:55.440
me keep a cent of this. So if you want to support the channel,

02:27:55.440 --> 02:27:57.440
please consider my Patreon, my SubscribeStar,

02:27:57.440 --> 02:27:59.440
my Twitch sub button, or the YouTube membership button.

02:27:59.440 --> 02:28:01.440
Every little bit helps and I greatly appreciate the support.

02:28:01.440 --> 02:28:03.440
I'm going to take a short SFO vacation

02:28:03.440 --> 02:28:05.440
now that this is out. I will return to the daily video

02:28:05.440 --> 02:28:07.440
grind on Monday, but I think I'm just going to relax with

02:28:07.440 --> 02:28:09.440
some video streams for the next few days.

02:28:09.440 --> 02:28:11.440
And yeah, I'll do the Minecraft server too now that I'm

02:28:11.440 --> 02:28:13.440
finally free from the editing dungeon. But yes,

02:28:13.440 --> 02:28:15.440
this was the fabled Kenobi review.

02:28:15.440 --> 02:28:17.440
I hope you enjoyed it, because if you didn't, I just tortured

02:28:17.440 --> 02:28:19.440
myself for weeks over nothing.

02:28:19.440 --> 02:28:21.440
I'll see you guys next time.

02:28:21.440 --> 02:28:23.440
I love you.
