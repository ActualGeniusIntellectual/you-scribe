0	1840	I have to run downstairs for just a second.
1840	2800	Sure, okay, go ahead.
2800	4600	If you want to respond to chat,
4600	5440	you're more than welcome to,
5440	7200	just don't say anything to us, all right?
7200	8320	Sure, okay, sure.
9280	11400	Well, the fact that Sanzil is 28 years old
11400	14020	and supports a senile child sniffer, Joe Biden,
14020	17520	who is obviously not any sort of strong young man
17520	19140	to guide the country in a right direction
19140	20600	is absolutely sad, pathetic,
20600	22440	and borderline criminal on his end.
22440	23920	Sanzil should be embarrassed.
23920	24800	He should be,
25800	27600	Biden doesn't want to do the right thing.
27600	28760	Biden is just,
28760	30480	doesn't care about the people of this country.
30480	32540	He cares more about people from other places.
32540	33640	That's very clear.
33640	37120	He's allowing for many people all across this country
37120	40480	to suffer in the broken systems and so forth.
40480	44080	And he's allays policies, especially regarding the border,
44080	46060	and he's trying to take people's guns,
46060	51060	and he's trying to get you to take the very suspect vaccine,
51280	52600	as well as many other things.
52600	57160	And so, Joe Biden is not to be trusted in the slightest.
57160	58640	He's just a criminal Democrat
59480	60360	that doesn't give a fuck about the people
60360	63400	and allows them to be fed slop for all time.
63400	64840	He won from fraud.
64840	67000	There's no way in hell he got 80 million votes.
67000	68240	He has no rallies.
68240	70880	He has nobody show up, nobody support him.
70880	72600	And basically people just voted for him,
72600	74280	not because they want what's right,
74280	76260	not because they want an actual country,
76260	78040	just because they want free stuff.
78040	80240	So that's the situation in America today.
80240	82560	It's, and Sanzil doesn't,
82560	85120	Sanzil would rather support these criminals
85120	86600	than actually do what's right
86600	89320	and understand that this whole motherfucking system,
89320	91840	this whole motherfucking country to some degree
91840	96240	needs to be re-evaluated, re-looked at and so forth.
96240	99000	Sanzil doesn't understand that we're just degrading
99000	100260	as time goes by.
101800	103320	Hello, sir, hi.
103320	104320	Hi.
104320	105920	So you sound like a lefty, dude.
107080	108960	Maybe, I mean, I can tell you
108960	112520	I'm just against the American government wholeheartedly.
112520	114440	Yeah, you sound like a revolutionary socialist
115320	117760	who, you know, wants to overthrow the government
117760	121960	and did you a lot of social spending to-
121960	123400	You happy with how America is today?
123400	124760	Okay, I'm back.
124760	125600	I'm not an American.
125600	126600	I don't care how America is today.
126600	128040	I don't give a fuck.
128040	132480	Okay, well, where are you?
132480	134280	I'm in Canada.
134280	136960	Okay, well, that's the state
136960	138960	maybe someone could argue even worse.
138960	140880	What, do you work for the government or something?
140880	142800	You and Sanzil, two best buddies,
142800	144360	one works for the Canadian government,
145240	146240	one works for the American government,
146240	147680	both corrupt, both evil,
147680	149520	both don't believe in the right thing.
149520	152280	Does Sanzil work for the American government?
152280	154840	In the loosest terms possible.
154840	156440	I'm like in education.
156440	158200	Sanzil looks connected to FBI agents.
158200	160520	He's convinced that I'm a CIA agent, but-
160520	161360	Oh, please.
161360	163280	Okay, well, what do you actually do?
163280	164200	I'm going to education.
164200	166600	So right now I'm working like it's a substitute teacher
166600	168800	and getting experience there.
168800	170840	Oh, okay, fair enough.
170840	174080	Didn't you get a degree for political science, bud?
174760	178120	I'm in school for political science, yeah.
178120	179560	Oh, okay, okay.
179560	181200	You're best friends with Destiny,
181200	185120	who's like a confirmed anti-extremist online federal agent
185120	186240	or something like that, right?
186240	188440	Well, I'm also anti-extremist, right?
188440	189840	But I just like engaging with them
189840	191440	because they're funny online.
191440	194800	You don't think this justifies a little bit of a-
194800	197120	I think that the only reason that these are extreme times
197120	199480	are because people like you buy into literally
199480	202720	every single fucking conspiracy that's ever been written
202720	205760	on the face of the planet and you warp them all into one
205760	209000	giant amalgamated fucking horrible conspiracy
209000	212880	where somehow 9-11 is tied in with flat earth,
212880	215000	is tied in with the JFK assassination,
215000	220000	is tied in with fucking Wuhan fucking China lab leaks
220720	221560	and shit.
221560	224440	Yeah, I think it's your group
224440	226440	that is making the world more extreme.
226440	231440	And then we see extremism in the early 2000s
233240	235040	after 9-11 from the right.
235040	237680	And then there was a massive backlash from the left on that.
237680	239560	It made a whole bunch of extremist lefties
239560	243000	because you'd expect extremists on one side
243000	244600	to breed extremists on the other side.
244600	245720	And then, oh, okay, bye.
245720	246560	Oh, okay, there you go.
246560	248680	It's not, yeah, no, my mic had just an issue.
248680	250040	It's not, no, it's not us.
250040	251160	I disagree wholeheartedly.
251160	252800	That's us making the extreme.
252800	255440	The extremists are generated
255440	258480	vis-a-vis failures of the American government.
258480	260280	The extremists are produced by-
260280	262400	But you always talk about the failures of the government,
262920	264280	but you never tell me like specifics
264280	266640	about what the government is failing us with.
266640	268520	Well, we just laid it out, man.
268520	269360	What about-
269360	270200	Hold on, I just got here
270200	272080	and I have a few questions for you.
272080	274440	Yeah, I'll let you guys talk for a second.
274440	275520	What do you want me to call you?
275520	277000	Will you work for the Canadian government
277000	278240	or what's the deal?
278240	279840	He's a YouTuber, dog.
279840	281520	I'm a YouTuber.
281520	283080	I work for myself.
283080	284080	That doesn't tell me anything.
284080	284920	Yeah, okay.
284920	288080	Okay, well, here, I'll tell you what.
288080	289880	Give him a little bit of a,
289880	291440	give him a little bit of a cut.
291480	293400	I don't support Trudeau, no, no.
293400	296160	I'm equal parts liberal and conservative.
296160	297400	I've voted for the liberals before.
297400	298480	I'm probably gonna vote conservative
298480	300720	in the next Canadian election.
300720	303400	I am definitely unaligned politically.
304640	306160	Okay, sure.
306160	309600	What do you think about Trudeau with his black face,
309600	310440	with all of his various,
310440	311840	have you seen all the costumes,
311840	314080	outfits, these pictures of him in?
314080	316080	Yeah, it's fucking hilarious.
316080	318080	Oh yeah, the black face one's really funny.
318080	319920	When he looks like Hitler in that other one,
319920	321200	that one's hilarious too, man.
321920	322760	That's a real joke.
322760	324560	I think that, I think he was doing some,
324560	327720	I think he was doing de Gaulle actually, but yeah.
327720	329480	Yeah, Trudeau's a fucking joke.
329480	331720	He's made Canada into a fucking joke.
331720	333160	I'm not a fan of Trudeau.
333160	335680	To be fair, I voted for him in 2015,
335680	338520	but if you listen to Trudeau's speeches in like 2013,
338520	340920	he was a significantly different person back then
340920	342120	than he is now.
342120	343320	I wouldn't vote for him again.
343320	345600	Look at what the poor truckers in Canada.
345600	347360	Imagine you're a trucker in Canada.
347360	349280	That's gotta be the worst experience ever.
349280	350720	Oh man, poor Canada truckers.
351360	352960	I actually want to talk to you about that a bit, okay?
352960	356320	So I don't want to put words in your mouth,
356320	359160	but I kind of have a feeling of what your position is
359160	360280	on this just by listening to you.
360280	362640	So I want you to confirm this, all right?
362640	365480	Were you one of the guys who, let's say a year ago,
365480	369440	maybe two years ago, you were saying that
369440	372080	the COVID lockdowns were going to be used by the government
372080	374960	as a way to seize power and take away liberty
374960	376680	from the people and that this was going to turn into
376680	379360	some kind of everlasting situation?
380320	382120	Well, it may not have turned,
382120	383920	I agree that that still could happen.
385120	387720	It's always possible that it could happen, yeah, but-
387720	389640	Yeah, I agree with all that, yeah.
389640	390600	Okay, yeah.
390600	393120	So the thing is, is that you're correct
393120	395760	in that there is a danger of that happening.
395760	399840	And there were some, let's say pretty bad politicians
399840	400920	who actually wanted to do that.
400920	402640	Maybe not in the States, but in Canada
402640	404640	and in the UK, definitely.
404640	406040	There were some politicians who said,
406040	407320	you know, this is the new normal.
407360	409600	We're going to have lockdowns and masks forever.
409600	411840	And you're going to have that VAX pass on your phone
411840	413040	for the rest of time.
413040	415280	And your liberties are gone and you're fucked
415280	417880	because it's going to be all in the name of safety.
417880	420240	And fair enough, there were some people out there
420240	423080	who seemed pretty evil, who were pushing for that stuff.
423080	427400	But here's the white pill, they all lost, all right?
427400	429640	Because the VAX pass is gone in Canada.
429640	431040	It's gone in the UK.
431040	432800	I think it's gone in the States.
432800	435400	None of these policies have actually come to fruition.
435880	437800	It's not gone in the States.
437800	440120	Really, so are you scanning a VAX pass
440120	441600	every time you have to go into a restaurant
441600	442760	like you did a few years ago?
442760	444720	Not me, but not me personally.
444720	446320	And I never, I got the VAX,
446320	448480	so I never have scanned any pass ever.
448480	450440	But not me personally, but I know people
450440	454360	that still are having to present their VAX, yeah.
454360	456200	100% that's still happening.
456200	457640	Like password, whatever.
457640	460760	In California that happens, I know for certain.
460760	463760	But it probably happens in other places in America too, yeah.
464760	467120	Now, to be fair, I don't know many Californians.
467120	470000	I do know one who says that the VAX pass,
470000	473000	she told me the VAX pass is gone in California.
473000	475680	So it's, well, it seems like
475680	478160	that all of these measures were temporary.
478160	480880	And though they could have been used to,
480880	483600	let's say, expand a government tyranny,
483600	485160	and there were some people who might have
485160	488800	even wanted to do it, they lost, all right?
488800	491420	And democracy actually won because those policies
491420	493340	were so unpopular they vanished.
494440	498760	Okay, but I agree that there's nothing really
498760	499600	that they could do.
499600	501560	I don't think it necessarily is about popularity
501560	504400	or unpopularity or anything of that nature.
504400	505240	I think-
505240	506060	Why do you say that?
506060	508640	I think to some degree, people just got tired of COVID
508640	511440	and they got, they refused to be locked down anymore.
511440	514240	Well, is that not popularity though?
514240	516000	The policies of keeping people locked down
516000	518840	became unpopular and so they vanished.
518840	520820	That's how it would work in a democracy, you know?
520820	522700	When the policies are popular, they happen.
522700	524660	And when they're not popular, they stop.
526340	528840	Yeah, but I don't, it's not about like,
529740	532180	I don't think COVID happened because it was popular
532180	534620	to shut everything down necessarily.
534620	536140	And that's why, you're saying that's like
536140	539860	kind of a warped view of like popular policy
539860	542000	will always prevail or something of that nature.
542000	543420	And that's just not the case.
543420	546340	Well, not always, but it often prevails, yes.
547340	551140	Okay, often is, I mean, it depends on the situation
551140	552860	I'd say, but-
552860	556060	Okay, so I don't know what your, hold on, hold on.
557060	558380	I have to ask you a question here.
558380	560180	It's gonna sound slightly insulting,
560180	561460	but I'm not meaning to be insulting.
561460	563580	I just wanna get to the heart of the matter, okay?
563580	565020	What's your education level
565020	566620	when it comes to this sort of thing?
568100	569660	Education level?
569660	572880	Yeah, how much do you know formally about politics?
573900	576500	Canadian politics, I don't know too much about,
576500	578300	but I can tell what they did with the trucker
578300	580060	shutting everything down was not good.
580100	581860	Like forcing them to get the vaccine
581860	584580	when there's the massive protests.
584580	587340	It's so, because they have to get the jab,
587340	588660	they don't even trust the government.
588660	590140	So why would the government,
590140	591780	how can they ask them to get that?
591780	593420	How can they require that?
593420	595260	I don't necessarily disagree with you on that because-
595260	597500	The threat of you can't feed your family.
597500	598740	I don't necessarily disagree with you,
598740	601220	but what I'm getting at though is,
601220	603100	are you an elite theory guy?
603100	604980	Is that like your framework that you're viewing
604980	607900	all these government actions through is through elite theory?
607900	609820	No, I don't, no, no, no, no.
610420	612380	It's just obvious the whole system's corrupt, man.
612380	614580	Biden's 400 years old sniffing kids.
614580	615980	Is that a leader you should have?
615980	618580	Is that what's right for the country?
618580	621500	Like it's just obvious that everything's broken.
621500	623900	Everybody's 400 pounds, yeah, through fraud, bud.
623900	626820	Everything's broken, everybody's 400 pounds.
626820	628520	The government's jack full of corrupt people
628520	630300	that don't care about what's right.
630300	631740	The systems are all broken.
631740	633380	They're not producing good people.
633380	635780	Their operation is horrible.
635780	636820	They don't know what they're doing.
636820	638180	They're not running correctly.
638220	640260	They're not running well.
640260	642460	I can't respond to everything, but-
642460	644380	Yeah, let him talk a little bit, all right?
644380	645500	I can't respond to all those points,
645500	646820	but there is one that I want to talk about
646820	648220	because you've mentioned a lot
648220	651140	about how you don't believe democracy is working, right?
652140	654680	100%, yes, absolutely.
654680	656140	So is this a case-
656140	657740	Look at where we are in America today
657740	659140	with so-called democracy.
659140	660820	Yeah, it's real beauty.
660820	664500	So is this a case of you think democracy itself,
664500	667000	like the practice of voting is just a bad practice,
667000	669800	or do you think that democracy could work,
669800	671920	but it's not working and it's been corrupted?
671920	675360	Well, you've got to do it correctly, I believe,
675360	676400	if you're going to do it,
676400	678960	but you have to have laws that make sense
678960	681640	and so forth in that regard.
681640	685480	Right, so you're not anti-democracy.
685480	686640	It's just that you think that democracy
686640	688600	right now isn't working.
688600	691300	Well, I'm not anti-democracy, not necessarily, no,
691300	695320	but whatever the best political structure
695360	699000	for any given country is, is whatever it is, I'd say.
699000	701000	So, certainly I don't believe
701000	703380	that every nation should ascribe to democracy,
705800	706840	but I think-
706840	708520	But America should?
708520	710860	Well, I think maybe there can be some regards
710860	712340	where it works, I guess,
712340	716680	but ultimately, by and large, I'd say I'm against it
716680	720600	because I think that you can produce
720600	722880	a better world without it.
723760	725840	It doesn't even make sense necessarily to me
725840	727960	that everybody gets a vote,
727960	729760	everybody gets treated as they're equal.
729760	733600	The government asks everybody's opinion on these matters.
733600	736480	I don't think that that even makes sense necessarily, so.
736480	737320	Go ahead.
737320	739000	So, wait, I just want to make this clear.
739000	741940	So, that sounds like that even if democracy
741940	743360	was perfectly functioning,
743360	745440	you still wouldn't want democracy
745440	747600	because you don't think democracy itself is good.
747600	749720	So, it's not that democracy is currently broken,
749720	752520	it's that democracy isn't good, even when it's working.
753400	754880	Is that what you think?
754880	757420	Like I said, I think maybe it can work in some regards,
757420	760080	but yeah, I'm generally by and large against it.
760080	761860	Yeah, especially in the U.S. more so,
761860	764560	but I can't really speak to other places that well.
764560	765400	Oh, that's fine.
765400	766900	We can talk about America, that's fine.
766900	769320	Why are you against democracy in the U.S.?
769320	771200	Well, because look at the situation, man.
771200	772680	Look at what it's been able to produce.
772680	774320	Look at what we're dealing with today.
774320	775800	It's produced-
775800	777200	What if it actually worked?
777200	779120	It wasn't rigged as you think.
780000	781600	Assume for a minute that the elections
781600	785760	were all actually not fraudulent, all right?
785760	786860	Even in that situation,
786860	789120	would you say that not democracy is not good?
790800	792800	Well, even, yeah, yeah, yes.
792800	794120	As for America, yeah.
794120	796300	Because look at what it's produced societally.
796300	799520	Look at what the point, look at what it's led us to, man.
799520	801320	The people in America are dying all over.
801320	802480	They're killing each other.
802480	803400	Nobody has anything.
803400	805040	Everybody's 400 pounds.
805040	806660	The government is shutting everything down.
806660	808400	The mad scientists have taken over.
808400	810800	Biden's 800 years old with a voice changer.
810840	812800	He's got an application for the illegal aliens
812800	814040	and he's sniffing the youth, man.
814040	815880	Okay, don't go on a whole monologue
815880	817640	because I don't know how much time he has, all right?
817640	818480	I don't want to-
818480	820200	To be fair, I kind of enjoy some of these.
820200	822320	Yeah, I don't want to make you feel like
822320	824240	you're wasting your time here.
824240	825200	There's no justice.
825200	826920	Nobody believes in what's right.
826920	829720	There's no, you have tremendous problems in all of this.
829720	830560	I know what you mean.
830560	831400	I know what you mean.
831400	835960	It's just that, so like, did you vote Trump in 2016?
835960	838300	Yeah, I voted for Trump twice, yeah.
838300	839320	Right, right, yeah.
839320	842640	And do you think that democracy worked in 2016 then?
846520	851280	Worked, I don't, to some degree, I guess, sure.
851280	852840	It's always working to some degree.
852840	854920	I don't know, that's kind of a weird question, worked.
854920	857040	Well, because it sounds like your problem
857040	859080	is not necessarily with democracy.
859080	861120	It's just with the outcome, right?
861120	863480	So if Trump actually won 2020,
863480	865120	you'd be a lot more cool with it.
867200	868680	I mean, it would be better,
868880	871120	but I don't know necessarily if I'd be cool with it.
871120	874920	I think there are problems that need, that are,
874920	876940	do you agree, do you think that democracy
876940	880000	always produces the best results for any given society?
880000	880880	No.
880880	881720	Okay, okay.
881720	884600	So you're not even for democracy necessarily.
884600	885520	I am in America.
885520	886400	I am in the West.
886400	889920	Oh, okay, so you, so do you, hold on, sir, sir, sir.
889920	891080	Has democracy produced,
891080	893360	has democracy in America produced better results
893360	894820	than a fascist state?
895720	896560	Yes.
896560	898560	How do you know that, you fucking idiot?
899920	901460	Tell me how, tell me, hey, stupid fuck.
901460	902760	Tell me how you know that.
902760	904360	You can't open your eyes all the way, tell me.
904360	906280	How do you know that, bud?
906280	908560	That democracy's produced better results
908560	909520	than a fascist state?
909520	910960	Yeah, yeah, tell me how you know that.
910960	912600	Or a fascist dictator would.
912600	913440	Tell me how you know that.
913440	914260	Tell me how you know that.
914260	916180	We'll look at, okay, I can tell you.
916180	918700	Look at the results of all the various fascist states
918700	920280	that we've seen in history.
920280	921860	That does, that says nothing to me.
921860	923280	That's absolutely retarded
923280	925560	and it's an unbelievably stupid take.
925600	927180	So I disagree totally.
927180	928840	So are you saying, hold on, hold on.
928840	930960	That as those, those would not necessarily
930960	932180	play out in America at all.
932180	934880	That would not be what happens 100%.
934880	935720	Just to be clear,
935720	939080	are you doing the real fascism has never been tried thing?
940140	942720	No, I'm saying that you are stupid, man.
942720	945280	If you don't believe that there are better systems
945280	948840	that could produce results superior than democracy.
948840	949680	Here's what I'll say.
949680	950760	Dude, that's just stupid.
950760	952880	I think that like, nobody's gonna ever say
952880	955720	that like we have like the perfect best system
955720	957880	like right now and nothing could ever be improved upon.
957880	961360	No, no person with like a half a fucking brain cell
961360	962280	would say that.
962280	964480	But what we're saying, I think this is what,
966560	968080	there's a lot of syllables.
968080	970200	Can I call you anything but.
970200	971040	I think you're my name.
971040	971860	My name's Dev.
971860	972700	Dev, okay.
972700	973540	My real name.
973540	975400	Two government agents, two government agents here.
975400	976400	I don't think that anybody.
976400	977720	I work for YouTube, baby.
977720	979640	I don't work for the government.
979640	982440	But I don't think that either of us are saying
983020	984480	that like this is a perfect system
984480	986480	and I've never fucking said that.
986480	989480	But like you can always like obviously improve
989480	993800	on the system, but you have to like improve on the system
993800	995140	and like fix the things that are broken.
995140	998600	But like why fix what's not broken, right?
999600	1002200	I guess my question is more that
1002200	1004760	why do you think an American fascist state
1004760	1006560	would be better than what you have now?
1006560	1007800	Why fix what's broken?
1007800	1011040	It's all, cause it's all broken to answer both of you guys.
1011040	1012000	Yeah, fix what's not.
1012560	1013400	It's all broken.
1013400	1015640	To answer both of you guys at once, it's all broken.
1015640	1018660	It's all not working how it should.
1018660	1022280	It's all, the corporations rule the country, man.
1022280	1023920	Nobody believes in what's right.
1023920	1026500	The people are like being turned into robots.
1026500	1027560	The people are being like.
1027560	1029400	Why would a fascist state fix that?
1030960	1033320	A fascist state could actually maybe, I believe,
1033320	1036960	produce better results than a democracy has produced.
1036960	1037780	But why?
1038880	1040720	Because I think it could be managed better.
1040800	1042440	I think that it could be altered.
1042440	1044000	It could be controlled better.
1044000	1046040	I think that you have problems that are,
1046040	1048840	people are, criminals are voting for.
1048840	1051720	Like our legal, our political system isn't about
1051720	1054240	necessarily the best and brightest rising to the top.
1054240	1056740	Most of these politicians are just front people
1056740	1060160	for their constituents or their financiers
1060160	1062480	or their backers and the likes.
1062480	1066680	So like they vote in ways that aren't,
1066680	1069880	like that they know are not necessarily the best.
1070680	1072760	Democrats vote illegal people in so they can get them
1072760	1075000	to vote for their party someday, potentially.
1077720	1079040	Okay, I understand the criticism.
1079040	1080880	And there's actually some decent criticism in there.
1080880	1083320	It's just, why do you think a fascist state
1083320	1085320	would manage that situation better?
1085320	1088120	Because I think it could be, you could easily control.
1088120	1091200	I think, oh man, because when you have that,
1091200	1094960	you have like a realm of possibility that's different
1094960	1098760	than there are gridlocked bureaucracy now.
1098760	1103760	Our gridlock bureaucracy that can't change anything
1103920	1105640	or takes forever to change it.
1107200	1109560	We live in the world of problems, man.
1109560	1111480	And it's like a fascist leader could come
1111480	1114880	and clean that up in, in my opinion, rather quickly
1114880	1117200	versus what we have now.
1117200	1118760	Like, you don't think so?
1118760	1120720	You don't think a fascist leader who believed
1120720	1122680	in the right thing, who wanted to do what's right,
1122680	1125120	could just come in and produce results like crazy?
1125120	1126440	You're skeptical of that?
1127400	1129680	You think democracy is producing better results
1129680	1131280	than a fascist leader could?
1131280	1133120	A fascist leader could give you a real cut?
1133120	1133960	I understand the point of view.
1133960	1136120	I understand the point of view because for example,
1136120	1137760	you know what NIMBYism is, right?
1139000	1141240	Oh no, NIMBYism?
1141240	1145080	N-I-M-B-Y, NIMBY means not in my backyard, all right?
1145080	1148040	NIMBYism is a problem unique to democracy.
1148040	1150000	So what the idea is, is, you know,
1150000	1152920	let's say that your country needs a nuclear power plant
1152920	1154880	or it needs a prison or it needs something
1154880	1157360	that is necessary, but it's unpopular
1157360	1160760	for the neighborhood that it's built in, right?
1160760	1162240	And so what you have is you have people
1162240	1165320	who are democratic voters, they turn around
1165320	1167120	and they say, well, you know what?
1167120	1168600	I know we need the nuclear power plant,
1168600	1170400	we need the prison, but I don't want it in my neighborhood
1170400	1172360	because I don't feel comfortable with that.
1172360	1175200	And so everyone votes to not have the necessary
1175200	1177200	infrastructure in their neighborhood,
1177200	1178680	so not in my backyard.
1178680	1180840	And so it gets built nowhere.
1180840	1183560	And that's a problem unique to democracy is that
1183600	1186560	people tend to vote in their own interests.
1186560	1188080	And when that interest doesn't line up
1188080	1191440	with the wider society, society tends to suffer.
1191440	1192280	So-
1193920	1197200	Yeah, when that interest doesn't do what's right
1197200	1199240	for the country, it doesn't produce the right result,
1199240	1201800	then yeah, there's a problem there, obviously.
1201800	1205440	You know, people are voting Democrats for free stuff
1205440	1207920	and illegal aliens are just pouring in our country
1207920	1209840	at this point in time.
1209840	1212360	So here's the thing, so you could have, for example,
1212360	1215600	a benevolent dictator who says, you know what?
1215600	1217880	We need the nuclear power plant and we need the prison.
1217880	1219000	It doesn't matter if it's unpopular.
1219000	1220120	I'm going to do what's necessary
1220120	1221440	and I'm going to build the infrastructure.
1221440	1223680	And if individual people don't like it,
1223680	1225440	well, they can suffer because fuck you,
1225440	1227600	we have to get what we have to get.
1227600	1230720	And that's a pretty reasonable critique,
1230720	1233800	a pretty reasonable authoritarian critique of democracy.
1234840	1237040	So I understand your point of view.
1237040	1240000	I've done a lot of reading of fascists recently
1240000	1241620	for some projects that I've have going on.
1241900	1243060	I know what's going on.
1244180	1246700	The reason that I brought up elite theory
1246700	1248420	is elite theory is basically,
1248420	1252180	it's a description of how governments operate.
1252180	1254500	It's a theory of how governments operate, right?
1254500	1258580	And the idea is that a small minority of people
1259480	1262280	and they consist of members of the economic elite
1262280	1265220	and people who make policy in government,
1265220	1267420	they hold the most power in society
1267420	1270700	and that that power operates independently
1270700	1272580	of democratic elections, all right?
1272580	1273740	So oftentimes-
1273740	1275380	I probably agree with that to some degree.
1275380	1277500	I mean, independently to some degree.
1277500	1279380	I mean, go ahead.
1279380	1282860	Right, so you've been talking about
1282860	1284500	an American fascist state
1284500	1287060	where a dictator could come in and clean everything up.
1287060	1289520	But at the same time, you've also been decrying
1289520	1291660	the very same use of that power
1291660	1294660	that you want to seize by other people.
1294660	1296180	It's a cabal of people
1296180	1298240	that don't necessarily have government control.
1298240	1300340	You're talking about elites in all different regards
1300860	1302100	that don't necessarily have anything to do
1302100	1303140	with the government, right?
1303140	1303960	I mean-
1303960	1304800	But here's the thing.
1304800	1307780	You would make the exact same elite structure.
1307780	1309440	That's what a fascist state is.
1311140	1313100	It's not some libertarian decentralized paradise.
1313100	1314740	It would be different elites.
1314740	1316860	It would be different elites.
1316860	1319460	The elites that you agree with is what he's saying.
1319460	1322240	Yes, so your problem isn't with the nature of power
1322240	1323700	as it currently exists.
1323700	1326220	Your problem is with who is currently wielding it.
1326220	1328340	You want the actual structure to be the same.
1328340	1330540	You just want somebody else in charge of it.
1330540	1333140	Well, those people don't have any power
1333140	1334860	akin to a fascist leader now.
1334860	1337980	So in that regard, you're comparing elitism
1337980	1340300	in two different guards that are not comparable,
1340300	1341140	in my opinion.
1341140	1343700	Oh, sure, you want more elitism, right?
1343700	1345340	Okay, here.
1345340	1347780	I'm gonna grab something real quick.
1347780	1349020	Okay, sure.
1349020	1351160	When it comes to elite theory, I'm gonna post this.
1351160	1354540	If you wanna bring it up on screen so and so, you can.
1354540	1355860	You agree that there are elites
1355860	1357560	that are controlling things, right?
1357640	1359240	Of course there are, of course there are, yes.
1359240	1361880	I don't think anyone can disagree with that.
1361880	1364580	Okay, and then these elites have more influence on,
1364580	1366440	they have a tremendous influence on society
1366440	1368340	compared to your average person, right?
1369200	1370360	Of course, yes, absolutely.
1370360	1371700	Okay, okay.
1371700	1373460	So this is a study.
1373460	1375480	This is what most people who believe
1375480	1377560	in this form of government lean on.
1377560	1378800	They lean on this study here.
1378800	1380400	It's from Cambridge University,
1381640	1383560	Testing Theories of American Politics,
1383560	1385920	Elites, Interest Groups, and Average Citizens.
1386240	1387560	Let me just tell you what this says, okay?
1387560	1388840	Real quick, real quick, okay?
1388840	1391520	So the data in the study is basically that
1392480	1395800	if you take, if you divide people by income,
1395800	1397560	income brackets, right?
1397560	1400980	And then you discover who they vote for
1400980	1403240	and why they vote for them.
1403240	1406260	If the person that they voted for wins,
1406260	1408600	the reason that they voted for them
1408600	1413600	is less likely to become policy the poorer that you are,
1413780	1414720	if that makes sense.
1414720	1419120	So basically, let's say poor people voted for Trump
1419120	1422880	in 2016 for policy A and rich people voted for Trump
1422880	1425760	in 2016 for policy B, all right?
1425760	1427660	Once Trump got into office,
1427660	1430000	the chance that he would implement policy A
1430000	1432640	for the poor people is around 0%.
1432640	1435840	Meanwhile, the chance that he would implement policy B
1435840	1439040	for the rich people is around 60%.
1439040	1440360	So, oh, he just took off.
1440360	1441200	Oh no, he's back.
1441200	1443400	Okay, well, I'd have to look at this.
1444360	1445680	That doesn't sound right to me
1445680	1448880	that just because of your financial situation,
1448880	1451560	you're more likely or unlikely to have a politician
1451560	1453920	do any given thing for you is,
1453920	1456280	I mean, I probably to some degree that's true,
1456280	1458000	but I don't think the way you're framing it
1458000	1460440	is very dishonest, I feel, but okay.
1460440	1461360	How do you mean?
1461360	1462200	I mean, it's-
1462200	1465580	Well, because it's the idea that like,
1465580	1467560	if you had large numbers of poor people
1467560	1472000	pushing for something like versus like rich people,
1472000	1474040	like I just don't, the way you said there
1474040	1475280	in regard to the poor people,
1475280	1476900	like it's just Trump's doesn't do anything
1476900	1477740	for the poor people,
1477740	1478920	it only does things for the rich people.
1478920	1481880	That's like laughably retarded, so.
1481880	1482720	Well, yeah, but I mean,
1482720	1484340	if we're talking about a cabal of people
1484340	1487320	who run the government, this is exactly how it would be.
1487320	1490200	It's not a cabal of people who run the government though,
1490200	1492160	the elites, like.
1492160	1493000	No.
1493000	1495080	Do you think elitism and fascism are the same thing?
1495080	1499900	Really quick, I'm gonna help you explain your point, okay?
1499900	1501980	So like, I think the way that he would describe things
1502800	1503640	is that the elites aren't necessarily
1503640	1505820	like in control of government directly.
1505820	1508460	They're also like pushing culture in such a way
1508460	1513460	as to like make people more subservient
1513740	1515060	or to make people, you know,
1515060	1516580	like he keeps on bringing the fact
1516580	1519780	that people are like fatter now than they used to be.
1519780	1522020	So like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
1522020	1525100	So you're going more down like a James Burnham
1525100	1527720	managerial revolution route, right?
1528820	1530460	No, sir, I believe in what's right
1530460	1532500	and I believe in fixing America, man.
1532500	1535100	I believe in stopping terrorism,
1535100	1537460	stopping doing what's right.
1537460	1539180	Yeah, that's what I want to happen, yeah.
1539180	1542340	I think a fascist leader could speed rocket that.
1542340	1545340	Right, so what I mean to say is James Burnham,
1545340	1546940	he theorized this idea.
1546940	1551940	And the idea was basically that Marx's analysis of classes,
1551940	1553660	the bourgeoisie and the proletariat
1553660	1558660	had been completely rendered useless by the post-war era.
1561020	1565940	And so he theorized of, he called it the managerial class.
1565940	1568520	And I think people like Moldbug came along later
1568520	1571060	and they talk about the cathedral in the same way, right?
1571060	1572380	But the idea of the managerial class,
1572380	1575060	the managerial class is a class of people
1575060	1579260	who they defy Marxist expectations because they own nothing.
1579260	1580780	They own no property,
1580780	1583720	but they control massive amounts of wealth and property
1583720	1585240	because they're managers, they're not owners,
1585240	1586080	they're managers.
1586080	1589380	So they have control without ownership.
1589380	1593300	And generally right-leaning people view the government
1593300	1596940	and view elites as being members of this managerial class
1596940	1598780	who don't actually own all that much,
1598780	1601180	but they wield tremendous amounts of power.
1603500	1604340	Is that?
1604340	1605180	Oh, he left again.
1605180	1607820	What you said was just like weird and confusing.
1607820	1609740	So what?
1609740	1612940	Managerial class, what's your point?
1612940	1615820	Well, does that sound like how you're viewing this?
1615820	1617460	Joe Biden isn't like super rich,
1617460	1619620	but he still wields all of this power, right?
1619620	1620880	And that's what the elites are.
1620880	1623060	They're not like the hyper wealthy.
1623060	1624580	They're just the-
1624580	1625900	I agree that you can have elites
1625900	1628940	in probably a lot of different regards, sure.
1628940	1631060	We were in terms of government and wealth.
1631060	1633740	And I mean, there's not many things beside that.
1633740	1634620	I mean, I guess that's it.
1634620	1636940	I mean, but yeah, you can have elites that have,
1636940	1638620	you know, financial backings.
1638620	1641180	And what are you talking about with the managerial class?
1641180	1642260	What was the point of saying that?
1642260	1644020	Like, I just don't understand.
1644020	1647820	So every time we've gone down a few rabbit holes now
1647820	1648660	in this conversation.
1648660	1652260	And it seems like every single time that we discuss this,
1652260	1655100	you don't actually want to change much about the way
1655100	1657020	that society is structured.
1657020	1659960	You just want to be, you want your guy to have the power.
1659960	1661140	That's it.
1661140	1664380	You know, cause like everything that you said.
1664380	1666380	It's not about, it's not about, it's not, sir.
1666380	1668380	It's not about my guy having the power.
1668380	1671160	It's about what's right and what's saying
1671160	1673140	and what's rational prevailing.
1673260	1677860	But you think that your people are the ones
1677860	1681020	that would be able to like do what is good.
1681020	1681860	Yeah, I do.
1683060	1684100	Leftists think that too.
1684100	1685420	Yeah, exactly.
1685420	1688020	Other people think that that's what's going on
1688020	1689420	with their side as well.
1689420	1691340	Like when I was a, when I was a socialist,
1691340	1695180	I tried so hard to find ways to like, you know,
1695180	1697980	like pretzel myself into a position that like,
1697980	1700900	or into like figuring out how like Joseph Stalin
1700900	1703740	wasn't like nearly as bad as he was, right?
1703740	1706020	But like, then I realized that that was fucking retarded
1706020	1708500	as fuck because he was a really bad dude.
1708500	1709580	I don't think he's so bad.
1709580	1710420	No.
1710420	1711980	I think he was a real bad,
1711980	1713980	he's a bad hombre in my opinion, but.
1714980	1718220	You hear guys like Vash and you listen to this guy talk
1718220	1720140	and he talks for like 15 minutes.
1720140	1722780	And what he's actually saying is good things are good
1722780	1723860	and bad things are bad.
1723860	1725900	And it's like, well, it doesn't tell you anything.
1725900	1727500	You know what I mean?
1727500	1730540	So you keep saying, I want to do what's right.
1731020	1732060	Well, what is what's right?
1732060	1733020	What is the good?
1733020	1735620	Like, what are you appealing to here beyond,
1735620	1738300	it just seems like you're just appealing to power.
1738300	1741060	Yeah, well, what's right is obviously not this, sir.
1741060	1742020	That's what it's to say.
1742020	1745820	I mean, you, you know, you say that it sounds complicated
1745820	1748700	to say what's right is right and what's bad is bad.
1748700	1750900	But I think that like, if people actually,
1750900	1752580	the thing is people don't know what's right
1752580	1754260	and what's wrong anymore in our society.
1754260	1757060	So they go, so that's how we have the society we do today.
1757060	1758260	People don't, quite frankly,
1758260	1760020	people don't care what's right anymore.
1760340	1761780	How did people know in the past what was right
1761780	1763460	and what was wrong?
1763460	1764620	I don't think that they,
1764620	1767420	I think maybe they had a different, I don't know.
1767420	1769140	Did they know in the past for certain?
1769140	1770420	I don't know if I think that they knew
1770420	1771580	in the past for certain.
1772820	1776860	But I think that it's obvious that things aren't right now
1776860	1780260	and you can't tell that democracy's not,
1780260	1782380	okay, but you think that it's going to be fixed
1782380	1783220	through democracy.
1783220	1785580	You think that what the best ideas are going to prevail.
1785580	1787500	Why haven't they prevailed already?
1787500	1789580	Why hasn't democracy led to a better results
1790060	1790900	than we have now?
1790900	1792500	Why is, because like-
1792500	1793900	I can answer that.
1793900	1796580	I don't think democracy is the problem, all right?
1796580	1800180	I think the reason that democracy is failing,
1800180	1801820	and I don't even think it's really failing that much,
1801820	1803380	but there are some problems with it, obviously.
1803380	1805060	The problem is the US government, sir.
1805060	1806860	The problem is the US government, go ahead.
1806860	1809220	Well, any problems that we're experiencing
1809220	1810780	regarding democracy right now,
1811740	1815540	it's not a problem of democracy or of liberal government
1815540	1817300	or of the types of governments that we have
1817300	1818700	or anything like that.
1818700	1821660	It's that there's something else going on with people
1821660	1824420	and that the cracks in democracy are a symptom
1824420	1825580	of a different problem
1825580	1827660	and changing government won't fix that.
1829460	1831660	Are you, how would it not fix that?
1832740	1834980	Because not everything comes from the state.
1835900	1838660	Okay, not everything, but the state could,
1838660	1840060	dude, if the state wanted to,
1840060	1842460	if the US government wanted to clean up the mess
1842460	1845420	that we are in today, they very easily could
1845420	1847180	if the right person was in office
1847180	1850380	and decided to do that, but they won't.
1850380	1851220	They won't fix it.
1851220	1852420	They don't care.
1852420	1854860	They're okay feeding the citizens slop
1854860	1857940	until revolution transpires, and that's who they are.
1857940	1859940	They don't care about you.
1860820	1863460	You've said slop a lot, but where's the slop?
1863460	1866740	In every regard, I've been laying it out.
1866740	1869380	Look at our society, you stupid dude.
1869380	1870460	It's filthy.
1871380	1873500	Okay, so you can't go to the grocery store
1873540	1875700	and buy broccoli instead of a hamburger?
1875700	1878980	Like you guys have broccoli in America, don't you?
1878980	1880860	Broccoli is good for you.
1880860	1884460	What, oh, sir, you don't have broccoli in Canada?
1884460	1885300	Yeah, we have broccoli.
1885300	1886140	I eat it every day.
1886140	1886960	It's good for you.
1886960	1887800	It's healthy.
1887800	1888740	It's not slop.
1888740	1890780	Oh, the broccoli is not slop, man.
1890780	1893140	Okay, that's obviously not what I'm talking about though.
1893140	1894700	What are you talking about?
1894700	1896900	Do you mean like cultural slop or not food?
1896900	1897740	Is that what you mean?
1897740	1900940	No, slop in all these different regards, man.
1900940	1902980	Like with the media as an example,
1903300	1904340	they feed you gray slop.
1904340	1906620	Our justice system, which isn't about justice,
1906620	1908500	feeds the citizens gray slop.
1908500	1911420	The government that's ran by a senile child sniffer
1911420	1915160	is in a sense feeding the citizens gray slop.
1915160	1920160	Like our economic system, which is tremendously unjust
1920780	1922460	in some degree, in my opinion.
1922460	1925200	Yeah, I think that's feeding the citizens gray slop.
1925200	1926040	Yeah.
1926040	1927720	Are you going for a socialist revolution now
1927720	1929380	or are you talking about the economic system?
1930680	1931520	Oh, I'm saying that.
1931960	1934600	I'm saying that if you've got, hold on, hold on, hold on.
1934600	1937440	I literally agree that if you've got mass wealth inequality
1937440	1939200	to the point where everything is horrible,
1939200	1941080	then yeah, that's a problem.
1941080	1944480	So, and obviously if you have mass wealth inequality
1944480	1946760	to the point where everybody is dying
1946760	1950440	and people have to like work like as slaves
1950440	1953440	and it's like the slaves are revolting
1953440	1956040	and it's like totally unjust and everybody knows it
1956040	1958400	and such, like that's obviously an issue.
1958400	1960380	That's obviously not gonna be productive for any nation.
1960380	1961220	Go ahead.
1961940	1964420	I figured a fascist doesn't mind inequality
1964420	1965720	as a general rule.
1966580	1967420	Well, sure.
1967420	1970780	Yeah, I mean, but I'm not a fascist necessarily, so.
1970780	1973300	You just advocated for a fascist government.
1973300	1975380	Okay, but again, I'm not a fascist necessarily.
1975380	1976980	I mean, you could advocate for a fascist government
1976980	1978620	and not be a fascist, right?
1978620	1979980	Here's the, here's where I-
1979980	1981180	Is it like your second choice?
1981180	1982740	Like, what do you mean?
1982740	1985340	This is the like breakdown in communication
1985340	1987380	every single time I have this conversation with them
1987380	1990860	because this isn't me and this guy's like first conversation.
1991660	1992480	Okay.
1992480	1993500	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1993500	1998500	So like, he doesn't have a holistic like worldview
2000220	2004460	that he wants to see like put out there necessarily.
2004460	2006660	He just doesn't like what's going on right now.
2006660	2010740	He doesn't have a form of government
2010740	2013920	that he particularly like enjoys,
2013920	2015340	but he just won like,
2015340	2017620	except for like some sort of authoritarian state.
2017620	2020580	Like he sucks off like current Russia
2020580	2023980	and like communist China pretty hardcore
2023980	2027020	because I, fuck, I don't know.
2027020	2031420	But like he claims to want freedom of speech,
2031420	2034780	but he also loves like the like tamping down
2034780	2037940	of political opposition like they do in Russia and China.
2037940	2041220	So like there's this like big amorphous political system
2041220	2044020	that he like kind of more enjoys,
2044020	2046100	but it's largely predicated on just like-
2046100	2048940	I want good things and I don't like bad things
2048940	2052060	and the bad things need to be like tamped out
2052060	2053740	with like brutal efficiency
2053740	2056340	and the good things need to be implemented
2056340	2061140	so that we can have whatever the good is.
2061140	2062740	I think I understand, I think I understand.
2062740	2064540	I mean, I don't know how you get the hyper efficiency
2064540	2066060	without any sort of competition, right?
2066060	2068860	Like any kind of command economy or command structure
2068860	2071060	generally leads to lack of inefficiency
2071060	2073460	because there's no competition pressure.
2073460	2074300	True.
2074300	2077060	Well, who's the competition for the US government?
2078380	2079820	Well, that is the problem.
2079820	2081420	It's the parties within
2081420	2084380	and the like sub factions within those parties
2084380	2085220	is the argument.
2085220	2088140	I don't know if Dev agrees with that, but.
2088140	2089860	There's no competition for that.
2089860	2091620	If there was a breakaway state
2091620	2093260	that actually competed with the government
2093260	2096460	and fixed the laws and like actually raised the children
2096460	2097300	and taught them good things.
2097300	2098860	Well, breakaway state would be like fixing
2098860	2100500	the like system itself.
2100500	2102340	It would just be, you know,
2102340	2104940	that you are advocating for revolution at that point.
2105820	2107580	I'm saying, well, then maybe that is
2107580	2108420	what I'm advocating for.
2108420	2110260	I mean, I'm advocating to,
2110260	2112300	I'm trying to make people's lives better.
2112300	2113700	And I'm saying that this,
2113700	2116580	the way we're living now is unacceptable.
2116580	2119500	The way we're living now is it doesn't even make sense.
2119500	2120340	It's horrible.
2120340	2121180	It's bizarre.
2121180	2123460	Everything is a land of injustice.
2123460	2124820	So many of the problems that you bring up,
2124820	2125940	I don't think are problems
2125940	2128620	that the average person actually deals with, right?
2128620	2129460	I feel like-
2129460	2131180	It is, I just dealt with injustice, man.
2131900	2133020	That's what I was about to say.
2133020	2134140	People that are fed through-
2134140	2135580	No, you are not the average person.
2135580	2137180	You are you, right?
2137180	2138220	But like the average person,
2138220	2140460	like in the past, you know,
2140460	2142380	ever since I stopped streaming full time,
2142380	2143940	like I've touched a lot of grass.
2143940	2145940	I've met a lot of people who are actual
2145940	2147580	like regular people, right?
2147580	2148620	And they don't talk about like
2148620	2149900	the government's feeding a slot.
2149900	2151460	They don't fucking like feel like
2151460	2153780	that's what the big issues in the country are, right?
2153780	2156340	They're worried about like the fact that
2156340	2157460	like if they're liberals,
2157460	2161060	they feel like the government is being,
2161060	2163980	like attempted to be taken over by like fascist factions.
2163980	2164820	Yeah, because-
2164820	2165660	If you're on the right wing,
2165660	2166500	if you're on the right wing,
2166500	2168900	then you believe that like the liberals
2168900	2173900	are using like bad intentions
2173900	2178700	to try and like circumvent the laws to steal elections.
2178700	2181020	But like more personally to them,
2181020	2183020	the average person is more concerned
2183020	2185220	with like the meat and potato issues,
2185220	2186500	as much as I hate to call them that.
2186500	2189420	Like, you know, inflation, cost of living,
2189460	2191900	you know, how expensive it is to afford a house,
2191900	2193220	how difficult it is to find a job.
2193220	2195580	They might not believe that revolution is possible.
2195580	2196420	I mean, I'm much younger than-
2196420	2199460	No, most people don't want revolution.
2199460	2201300	Yeah, that's true.
2201300	2202580	There's a lot of older people
2202580	2204140	that do not support revolution,
2204140	2206340	but I think you're gonna see really the young people.
2206340	2209940	Do you think I hang out with a bunch of like anti-communist
2209940	2213620	or anti-fascists, like 70 year olds?
2213620	2216060	Maybe people don't support, maybe people don't.
2216060	2217460	I do think there are a lot of people
2217460	2218740	that, more now so than ever,
2218900	2220060	that do support revolution.
2220060	2221700	But I think a lot of people might believe
2221700	2223900	revolution's unreasonable or can never happen
2223900	2224740	or these sort of things,
2224740	2226620	or they're just not capable of it
2226620	2227980	or things of like that nature.
2227980	2229540	So, you know, there's plenty of reasons
2229540	2232540	why they'd focus more on less substantial issues
2232540	2235220	than total revolution, but I'm going for it all
2235220	2238300	in the sense that I see everything broken with the US.
2238300	2241460	I can see this whole, the US government is an operation.
2241460	2244060	You have to view it like an operation.
2244060	2245240	Probably other countries too,
2245240	2246500	but especially the US government,
2246500	2247820	that's all I really know about.
2247820	2250780	And they're an operation that doesn't know how to,
2250780	2252820	like they're bad operators.
2252820	2254740	These operators are like taking the train
2254740	2258380	down the wrong railroad and I'm screaming at them,
2258380	2261020	do what's right, take it down the right path.
2261020	2261840	And they-
2261840	2262680	Hey, hold on, hold on.
2262680	2263600	I wanna drill down on this.
2263600	2266780	How do you know that what you think is right
2266780	2267980	is actually right?
2269980	2272820	Well, I think that, well, right is a,
2272820	2275220	we can go into the whole morality conversation
2275220	2276540	if you want to, but I think-
2276540	2278260	We have to, because you're saying,
2278260	2279700	do what's right over and over.
2279700	2281060	That's like your main point,
2281060	2282380	you have to live in that conversation.
2282380	2285780	Well, I mean, we do to some degree, I guess maybe,
2285780	2289100	but mostly I'm just talking about results being produced.
2289100	2291380	I'm talking about just like normal,
2291380	2293040	good things happening to people.
2293040	2295540	Like I'm not, I don't wanna go like nitty gritty
2295540	2296940	about moral issues.
2296940	2299940	It's good if people are living, people are prosperous,
2299940	2302500	people are successful, people are happy,
2302500	2306220	people trust the government and the government trusts them.
2306740	2307580	Like these sort of things.
2307580	2310460	Like people are, people feel like they're living in like a-
2310460	2311380	A utopia.
2313060	2315740	Honest place, I guess, to some degree, I'd say,
2315740	2317340	where it's not the core,
2317340	2320060	it's not McDonald's arches ruling the society
2320060	2322660	and mass injustice transpiring, but rather-
2322660	2325040	God is telling us to comment on this, holy fuck.
2325040	2325880	No, I get it.
2325880	2330360	So you want a return to like the 1950s high trust society
2330360	2332340	where you could walk down the streets of New York
2332340	2334340	and not get fucking mugged or like stop-
2334340	2337020	Well, I think there are countries
2337020	2338620	that have already erased crime.
2338620	2341100	There are countries where crime, there is no crime.
2341100	2343400	Our government isn't capable of erasing crime,
2343400	2345420	but it's already happened in other places.
2345420	2349060	And I believe it's possible to produce a society
2349060	2350860	where there is no crime.
2350860	2354260	Great, so you want that high trust society back
2354260	2358140	where it's like I said, you could walk down the road
2358140	2360260	in a city and not get mugged by a random person.
2360260	2362220	There's not random violence in the streets.
2362260	2365100	You see videos of random violence go viral all the time
2365100	2367300	on TikTok, that's what you're talking about, right?
2367300	2368140	Yeah, it's horrible.
2368140	2369220	Yeah, I think that's horrible.
2369220	2371060	So here's the thing,
2371060	2375000	authoritarian systems always destroy high trust societies
2375000	2377260	because everyone's an informant for the party.
2377260	2378720	A fascist state wouldn't do this.
2378720	2379940	It would do the opposite of it.
2379940	2382460	It would make everyone distrustful of everyone else
2382460	2384720	because that guy might be a snitch.
2387760	2390660	I disagree that that's what necessarily would happen.
2390660	2393020	Can you give an example of a fascist government
2393020	2394940	or like a highly authoritarian government
2394940	2396460	that that didn't happen in?
2396460	2399740	There wasn't like, I mean, to some degree,
2399740	2403400	there's always gonna be trust in an authoritarian country.
2403400	2407900	I mean, I'd probably argue, but I mean,
2407900	2410220	you're saying it's just less trust than,
2410220	2413100	you would literally argue that we, like,
2414580	2416140	I mean, within any government,
2416140	2418580	there's gonna be levels of trust.
2418580	2420620	If we're just talking about trust,
2420620	2424020	but you would argue that like a fascist state,
2424020	2426020	there would be less trust amongst the people
2426020	2427740	than what we have now?
2427740	2429020	Yes.
2429020	2431800	No, well, it's not necessarily about trust
2431800	2433460	within the government.
2433460	2434660	I mean, that's a different conversation,
2434660	2435700	but I think that you could produce,
2435700	2437660	I think there could be a fascist state
2437660	2438860	where people have trust in the government.
2438860	2440540	Probably people had trust in the government
2440540	2441640	in the Nazi state,
2443180	2446060	but it's more about the people's,
2446060	2448380	I'd say it's more about the people's trust in government
2449020	2449860	than anything, I think.
2449860	2450820	But even then, it would be destroyed,
2450820	2454620	because for example, it's very easy in Nazi Germany
2454620	2456640	for one person to just trust their neighbors,
2456640	2459100	because who knows if they're hiding something
2459100	2460380	that they should be reporting,
2460380	2462900	or if their neighbor's gonna report on them.
2462900	2464940	Who knows if that's happening in America today?
2464940	2467640	And you're talking about reporting, like what kind of,
2467640	2469540	yeah, that's, what are you talking about reporting?
2469540	2470900	Listen, listen, listen, okay, okay, so,
2470900	2473020	do you call back- What if somebody reports,
2473020	2473860	what if somebody reports,
2473860	2476780	what if I report my neighbor for being black,
2476780	2478300	or just cause I don't like him or something?
2479180	2480020	What are you talking about, reporting?
2480020	2480840	Well, nothing's gonna happen
2480840	2481940	because you live in a democracy, right?
2481940	2484780	But do you recall, hold on, do you recall back-
2484780	2486140	How do you know nothing's gonna happen?
2486140	2487300	What happened to George Floyd?
2487300	2488700	They pulled up and killed him,
2488700	2490540	and we live in a democracy, right?
2491460	2492660	Yeah, let's not get started on that one,
2492660	2495200	because I probably have a spicier take on that than you do.
2495200	2497780	But, but hold on, hold on.
2497780	2501100	So, do you recall back during the,
2501100	2504220	let's say the first third of the pandemic,
2504220	2507140	there was a big uproar because having,
2507180	2508460	at least in some countries, in some,
2508460	2509300	I don't know about the states,
2509300	2511180	but definitely in Canada, definitely in the UK,
2511180	2513940	having more than like six or five people in your house
2513940	2515420	was considered a crime.
2515420	2517760	And so you had people snitching on their neighbors,
2517760	2518600	being like, listen, officer-
2518600	2520300	That happened in the US too, yeah.
2520300	2521220	That happened in the US?
2521220	2522060	Yeah, for sure.
2522060	2523420	Yeah, see, but here's the thing.
2524380	2529300	A democracy like the US, like Canada, like the UK,
2529300	2531660	these democratic liberal countries
2531660	2534180	only started becoming low trust
2534180	2537300	to the point that you had neighbors snitching on neighbors
2537300	2539700	when the government became more authoritarian
2539700	2541480	to enforce these lockdown rules.
2545760	2547380	The neighbors only snitched on neighbors
2547380	2549060	when the government became more authoritarian
2549060	2550620	to support the lockdown rules?
2550620	2551440	Yes.
2553100	2555280	Well, people probably snitched on their neighbors
2555280	2556700	before that, but I mean,
2556700	2558900	these aren't authoritarian countries,
2558900	2562080	these are democracies where people are snitching.
2562080	2562920	Yeah, but here's the thing.
2562960	2564400	What is the argument exactly?
2564400	2565800	You're saying they're democracies
2565800	2568480	that operate as authoritarian style societies
2568480	2570440	and then people are snitching.
2570440	2572400	So therefore authoritarianism is bad?
2572400	2575120	Like how naive is, how retarded naive is that?
2575120	2578320	So the argument is that a lot of right-wing people,
2578320	2580240	correctly in my opinion,
2580240	2582080	said that democratic government-
2582080	2584760	The snitching, hold on, the snitching has nothing to do-
2584760	2585600	Hold on, just a sec.
2585600	2588420	The snitching has nothing to do with democracy
2588420	2591320	or any of it, authoritarianism or any of it.
2591320	2592160	It actually does.
2592240	2593080	It does not, sir.
2593080	2593920	It does not.
2593920	2594740	I'll explain it to you.
2594740	2595580	I'll explain how it does, okay?
2595580	2600580	So the right wing correctly criticized liberal governments
2600640	2602560	for becoming more authoritarian
2602560	2605620	as they implemented more harsh lockdown measures
2605620	2606920	during COVID.
2606920	2609320	That was a correct assessment of the situation.
2609320	2611680	And a lot of people who are, let's say,
2611680	2613420	more classically liberal, like me,
2613420	2615280	were worried for a time that some of this stuff
2615280	2618060	might actually remain in place for long periods.
2618060	2619720	Turns out it didn't, that's good.
2619760	2624520	But in a more free society,
2624520	2628660	there's no impetus to snitch on someone, right?
2628660	2631800	Like if you have a more authoritarian society
2631800	2633620	where the government can come in
2633620	2637840	and arrest people for mundane things
2637840	2638680	like having to-
2638680	2641640	You're not understanding what authoritarianism
2641640	2643560	actually is or means, but okay.
2644540	2647120	So real authoritarianism has never been tried?
2647120	2648600	When they're arresting those people,
2648640	2650600	that's on the back of democracy.
2650600	2652960	That's not on authoritarianism, right?
2652960	2654840	You're saying that, what are you saying?
2654840	2656200	I'm confused.
2656200	2657440	I mean, do you believe that,
2657440	2658800	why are they arresting those people?
2658800	2660320	You're saying because of fascism,
2660320	2662020	they're snitching on their neighbor?
2662020	2663560	Are you retarded?
2663560	2665880	Fascism doesn't produce snitching on their neighbor
2665880	2666720	necessarily. Hold on, let him speak
2666720	2667600	because you're not understanding a word he's saying
2667600	2668440	because everything he's saying-
2668440	2669360	No, fascism does not.
2669360	2672560	Oh, he's saying fascism produces this snitch style society.
2672560	2673400	And I'm saying that that is-
2673400	2675240	No, he said authoritarianism does.
2675240	2676080	Okay, whatever.
2676080	2676920	Okay, that's authoritarianism.
2676920	2677960	Because socialist governments do it too.
2678320	2679160	Socialist governments do it too.
2679160	2683320	So for example, I actually know a YouTuber in Romania
2683320	2686480	who has described the low trust society
2686480	2689800	he finds himself in after several generations
2689800	2690880	of communist rule.
2690880	2692560	Authoritarian societies,
2692560	2694580	because of the fact that they're authoritarian,
2694580	2695840	they have secret police,
2695840	2697960	they have very strict laws and regulations.
2697960	2701560	These societies produce a low trust society.
2701560	2705080	And the reason is, is because you have people
2705080	2707080	who are snitching on other people.
2707080	2709640	Citizens don't trust each other because-
2709640	2711080	Do we trust each other here?
2712120	2713600	No, you don't.
2713600	2715600	I think you could produce a fascist state
2715600	2717640	or authoritarian state where people trust each other
2717640	2720600	literally 20 times more than what we have now, sir.
2720600	2721840	I don't think it's possible.
2721840	2723920	I think that's very easily done.
2723920	2725800	You're so naive if you think that.
2725800	2727680	People don't trust each other now.
2727680	2731040	People don't trust each other with democracy right now.
2731040	2732760	People snitch on each other
2732760	2734520	because they think it's funny in our country.
2734520	2737320	Because in that kind of country,
2739520	2742000	some snitching is justified.
2742000	2743840	But I don't think there would necessarily be
2743840	2745600	these authoritarian style laws
2745600	2747400	where people would be snitching on each other
2747400	2749440	in a fascist state.
2749440	2751240	I just can't imagine.
2751240	2752240	If it's a fascist state,
2752240	2755240	how are they gonna produce those sort of things?
2755240	2756440	You would think that they would be running
2756440	2758360	a better operation than everybody going around
2758360	2760920	snitching on each other in these tiny regards.
2760920	2763040	Well, how do they get the information though?
2763040	2764680	How do they get the information?
2764680	2767080	Here, let's say that in fascist America,
2767080	2769120	let's say I'm living in fascist America, okay?
2769120	2770920	Your idealized fascist America.
2770920	2773000	And I'm running some sort of underground group.
2773000	2775720	I have like a secret liberal group where we get together
2775720	2777560	and maybe trade banned liberal books.
2777560	2779440	And we talk about one day
2779440	2780960	reinstituting a liberal government.
2780960	2785600	You would have to have a snitch in my operation
2785600	2787640	to actually come in and stop me.
2787640	2788480	Well, sure.
2788480	2790080	I mean, if it was a fascist state to the degree
2790080	2794600	where they're banning books and they're like, you know,
2794600	2797080	but I mean, I think that if the books are really bad,
2797080	2798560	then they probably should be banned.
2798560	2801200	So you probably do deserve to be snitched on.
2801200	2802760	I mean, to your degree,
2802760	2804480	some snitching is always justified.
2804480	2806880	Some snitching can be justified.
2806880	2809280	It depends what we're talking about,
2809280	2812160	but generally I think the answer to that is no.
2813400	2815400	Snitching can never be justified?
2815400	2817160	Not never, but generally.
2817160	2819800	So for example, I wouldn't snitch on my friend
2820400	2821240	if he managed-
2821240	2822080	You would have better laws where-
2822080	2822920	Hold on, hold on.
2822920	2823740	You could have better-
2823740	2824580	Hold on, hold on.
2824580	2825400	Hold on, hold on.
2825400	2826240	Holy shit.
2826240	2827080	No, no, no.
2827080	2827920	Cause he's not, cause he's not,
2827920	2828760	everything he says is retarded.
2828760	2829580	You could have better laws
2829580	2831480	where less snitching actually transpires
2831480	2833560	in an authoritarian style country.
2833560	2835080	Like you're saying,
2835080	2836520	because the laws could,
2836520	2838360	the kind of society, the operation-
2838360	2840880	Anti-snitching laws in a fucking fascist society?
2840880	2844560	An operation could be run where there is the snitch,
2844560	2847160	snitching isn't a thing where nobody wants to snitch,
2847160	2848760	where it doesn't even make sense to snitch.
2848760	2850320	There is nobody to snitch to.
2850320	2851160	And-
2851160	2853640	In an authoritarian government?
2853640	2855720	So how does the government get the information
2855720	2858120	that it needs then if no one's snitching?
2858120	2861560	What's, how do they get the information they need?
2861560	2862400	Yeah.
2862400	2863220	What kind of government?
2863220	2864700	The authoritarian government?
2864700	2865760	Yes.
2865760	2866880	In your idealized government.
2866880	2867720	Okay.
2867720	2868680	Your idealized system,
2868680	2869720	there's no snitching,
2869720	2870840	but it's a fascist state.
2870840	2871680	Okay.
2871680	2873620	How does the fascist state get the information
2873620	2874800	that it needs from people
2874800	2877160	if no one's telling them anything?
2877200	2880680	Well, I mean, obviously they have to talk about something.
2880680	2882840	Like if somebody breaks a law, man,
2882840	2884280	then snitching has to happen
2884280	2886200	no matter what country you're in, right?
2886200	2888020	You agree with that, right?
2888020	2888860	Sure.
2888860	2889920	And here's the thing, like, for example,
2889920	2891240	I would probably snitch on my friend
2891240	2892540	if he murdered someone.
2892540	2894600	But if my friend got away with a speeding ticket,
2894600	2895800	I wouldn't snitch on him.
2897320	2898840	If he got away with a speeding ticket,
2898840	2899680	or what do you mean got away?
2899680	2900520	As in, if he-
2900520	2902640	Or ran from the police and got away or something?
2902640	2905440	Yeah, like if it was like a misdemeanor crime
2905440	2906320	and he got away with it,
2906320	2908600	and there's no danger of him being caught,
2908600	2910000	I wouldn't tell the cops, no.
2911860	2913120	Oh, well, maybe you should then.
2913120	2914720	If it was a misdemeanor, maybe then.
2914720	2916600	Yeah, I mean, but that could easily happen
2916600	2917440	in an authoritarian state.
2917440	2918260	It depends on the crime, right?
2918260	2919100	It depends on the crime.
2919100	2920600	Why do you think, you know,
2920600	2923760	it could be more unlikely for somebody to snitch
2923760	2926260	in that exact example in an authoritarian state
2926260	2929780	because of, it could be more harsher and-
2929780	2930620	Go ahead.
2930620	2931440	I can describe it to you.
2931440	2936240	So the fundamental issue is that authoritarian states,
2937120	2941240	they have to take behavior that is relatively normal
2941240	2942960	and make it illegal.
2942960	2946160	And the reason that they have such wide,
2947440	2949520	like secret police apparatuses,
2949520	2954520	is because in order to get people to not do normal things,
2954880	2957640	you have to have some sort of,
2957640	2960520	well, here, this happened in East Germany.
2960520	2964820	Well, what kind of normal behavior has to be illegal
2964820	2965660	in a fascist state?
2965980	2970140	Tell me what exact normal, what exact normal behavior.
2970140	2972460	Yeah, harboring Jews is a big one.
2972460	2973700	But here's the thing,
2973700	2975300	I can give you an example from a communist.
2975300	2976860	It's normal to harbor Jews.
2976860	2978660	It's normal to harbor Jews.
2978660	2981420	If they're being exterminated, yes, you should do that.
2982560	2985660	Let's not go super down this rabbit hole
2985660	2987660	because I feel, I have a feeling I'm afraid here.
2987660	2989820	You don't think anything could justify their extermination?
2989820	2991480	Ah, let's be real.
2991480	2992320	Let's be real.
2992320	2993300	Let's move past.
2994300	2996080	Wait, are you talking about?
2997140	2998420	Yeah, he's full JQ.
3000100	3002540	Okay, listen, I can give you an example from East Germany.
3002540	3005740	Okay, communist state, just as authoritarian, okay?
3005740	3009820	So they had to outlaw ownership.
3009820	3013160	I think they had to outlaw ownership of multiple properties.
3013160	3015900	So for example, you couldn't own two houses, right?
3015900	3017720	And what they had to do is like,
3017720	3022180	well, how can you tell that this house is owned
3022220	3024940	by somebody else without someone informing, right?
3024940	3027620	One of the reasons that East Germany
3027620	3030620	had the most extensive secret police in the world
3030620	3032720	is because they were literally using it
3032720	3035180	to track people's purchases and discover,
3035180	3038020	hey, like, are you buying things
3038020	3041300	that you shouldn't be buying with your paycheck?
3041300	3043540	That's extremely authoritarian.
3043540	3046820	But that sort of authoritarian control of an economy
3046820	3049740	requires massive amounts of data collection.
3049740	3051580	So you have the secret police
3051860	3053700	and you have informants.
3053700	3055140	That's why something like in Romania,
3055140	3057940	something like one fourth of all citizens
3057940	3060860	at one point was a government informant, you know?
3060860	3064100	These top-down overarching systems
3064100	3067940	have to have such ridiculous secret police systems.
3067940	3070260	How many people work for the government in that regard?
3070260	3072500	Like 25% of people.
3072500	3075080	Yeah, 25%, one in four.
3075080	3079260	Yeah, like you're saying two houses in a fascist state
3079260	3081540	and then somebody snitches, like that's the least of them.
3082380	3084220	This would be a communist.
3084220	3086260	Or authoritarian state, whatever, communist state.
3086260	3089300	It's two houses and somebody snitches is like,
3089300	3091420	that means nothing to me, man.
3091420	3092740	True, but here's what it is though,
3092740	3095580	is that if you have enough money,
3095580	3098220	buying two houses is a pretty normal thing to do.
3098220	3099180	Who's to say that?
3099180	3103740	Just let me explain, let me explain this.
3103740	3107400	So what I was getting at is that authoritarian governments
3107400	3111020	have to make some normal behaviors illegal.
3111420	3112820	I disagree with that.
3112820	3113980	That's where we disagree.
3113980	3116260	I don't know where, can you give me an example?
3116260	3117580	You're saying harboring Jews,
3117580	3118940	but can you give me another example
3118940	3120340	because we're on YouTube?
3120340	3121860	Okay, so we're not gonna talk about the harboring Jews.
3121860	3124740	That's your one, like, okay, there's the freebie.
3124740	3127140	Okay, okay, because of YouTube, because of YouTube.
3127140	3130300	Otherwise I would be open to taking that on, but okay.
3130300	3131140	Okay, okay.
3131140	3133920	I disagree, normal behaviors have to be illegal.
3133920	3136600	I think you're naive to what a fascist state would be.
3136600	3138300	I think even you-
3138340	3141560	Would you make non-heterosexual sex illegal?
3143860	3146380	Now you're asking me what my personal ideal is.
3146380	3148500	Yes, your personal, because you're telling us
3148500	3149740	what the good is. Your fascist state.
3149740	3151300	Yeah, your fascist state.
3151300	3152920	You're the leader.
3152920	3153980	We're saying-
3153980	3156100	You're the Fuhrer of your own state.
3156100	3157620	Okay, okay.
3157620	3161300	Would you make non-heterosexual sex illegal?
3161300	3163420	I'm not saying I should be the Fuhrer.
3163420	3166980	I'm not necessarily, like I said, I'm not necessarily-
3167020	3171380	Would your ideal Fuhrer make non-heterosexual sex illegal?
3174820	3176900	Non-heterosexual sex illegal.
3176900	3179420	I think it's hard to say.
3181900	3184420	I don't think so, no, I don't think so, no.
3184420	3187620	Illegal is one thing,
3187620	3189540	but the punishment of a legality
3189540	3190860	is a whole other thing, right?
3190860	3194060	So I think it wouldn't be bad
3194060	3196020	if necessarily it was frowned upon.
3196060	3197900	I wouldn't necessarily be so much against that,
3197900	3202240	but illegal is, maybe you could say it's too far,
3202240	3205600	but maybe there's some punishment is just,
3205600	3207620	I mean, it depends.
3207620	3209820	If it's legal, how can there be punishment?
3214020	3215740	No, I'm not saying it to be legal.
3215740	3217180	I'm saying it can be illegal,
3217180	3218820	but maybe the punishment isn't,
3218820	3221180	you kill the person obviously or something.
3221180	3223580	But what's the punishment though?
3224580	3227300	I don't know, you have to take classes,
3227300	3229620	you have to figure out what's going on with you
3229620	3231700	that would make you wanna engage
3231700	3232660	in that type of behavior.
3232660	3234660	I mean, there are ways to mitigate that behavior
3234660	3236700	and however that can be best enacted in the law
3236700	3238420	probably should be.
3238420	3241900	Okay, so how would your government discover
3241900	3244220	if somebody is having gay sex?
3246300	3248040	I don't know, maybe somebody would inform
3248040	3250540	somebody else about it, but I'm not saying that-
3250540	3252020	So you'd have snitches.
3252020	3254860	In regard to the gay sex thing and sexual degeneracy,
3254860	3257460	I think that any amount of sexual degeneracy
3257460	3259820	is gonna be normal to some degree in a society.
3259820	3262420	And so, yeah, but if people were snitching,
3262420	3265700	I mean, people snitch about bestiality in our society now.
3265700	3267700	So snitching, you agreed to me earlier,
3267700	3271240	snitching can be okay, but you don't like snitching
3271240	3273440	when it conflates with your personal moral views
3273440	3274820	of the world.
3274820	3278060	And so- Yes, but it's the same thing with you though.
3278060	3282140	Sir, but sometimes your personal,
3282140	3283860	sometimes that snitching is justified
3283860	3287040	whether it's your personal view of the world or not.
3287040	3289500	And so- Okay, if that's the case,
3289500	3292540	how is snitching on a person having gay sex justified?
3293780	3296220	I'm not saying that that necessarily is justified.
3296220	3299780	I'm saying that maybe you need to look into that
3299780	3301420	to some degree and figure out what's going on
3301420	3302260	with the person.
3302260	3303660	And if somebody's got a snitch,
3303660	3305300	again, people snitch about bestiality.
3305300	3308620	People snitch about homosexuality now to others,
3308620	3310700	but it's just not to the legal system.
3310700	3312180	They snitch to their friends about it.
3312180	3314380	They snitch to whoever, they tell other people,
3314380	3315220	I don't know if you consider that,
3315220	3316300	I don't know if that's really snitching,
3316300	3318900	but they'll, you know, it's just not done
3318900	3319740	to the government. Not in terms of what
3319740	3320580	we're talking about, no, it's a different thing.
3320580	3321520	That's a different thing.
3321520	3323300	In this conversation, we're talking specifically
3323300	3327020	about how does the government get the accurate information.
3327020	3328360	No, no, what I'm talking about,
3328360	3329580	and I'm talking about how does the government
3329580	3331980	get the information necessary to implement its laws?
3331980	3333440	That's what I'm talking about.
3334440	3337000	Yeah, and it's the same way that it's done
3337000	3339080	in every other country, dude.
3339080	3340240	That's what my answer is.
3340240	3342080	It's the same way it's done now,
3342080	3345580	and I'm telling you it can be done even better, probably.
3345580	3347200	I mean, I don't necessarily think,
3347200	3349000	but I wouldn't necessarily,
3349000	3352960	like there wouldn't be punishments for homosexuals,
3352960	3356340	like you would believe, but I think, you know,
3356340	3358920	probably snitching to some degree on homosexual behavior
3358920	3360160	isn't necessarily a bad thing.
3360160	3361360	Do you think that's bad?
3361360	3363360	Depends what you mean.
3363360	3366360	Do you think it's bad if the government knows you're gay?
3368720	3370480	What if there is no punishment?
3370480	3373600	If the government does nothing with the information, no.
3373600	3374420	Okay.
3374420	3375260	Because I don't think there's anything wrong
3375260	3376100	with being gay.
3376100	3377960	But hey, you know, at least what this means
3377960	3379920	is that Nick Fuentes can have his catboys
3379920	3381080	in your society, right?
3382140	3383820	It's a bad, is it a bad thing
3383820	3386480	if everybody in the society is gay?
3386480	3388560	Is it a bad thing if homosexuality
3388560	3391000	is on the rise in a society?
3391520	3392360	Answer that question.
3392360	3393720	Is it a bad, answer that question.
3393720	3396000	Is it a bad thing if homosexuality-
3396000	3397880	I think it can actually reach a point
3397880	3398720	where it does become bad.
3398720	3400080	There's too many people who are gay, yeah.
3400080	3402220	Okay, so then you would even justify snitching
3402220	3403360	to some degree.
3403360	3404680	No, no, because here's the thing,
3404680	3405520	I wouldn't make it legal.
3405520	3406800	If there's too many people that are gay
3406800	3408440	and you're not having enough kids,
3408440	3410360	everybody's turning gay for some reason
3410360	3413380	and there's nobody being, no kids being produced,
3413380	3414220	then-
3414220	3415280	Because there's chemicals in the water, yeah.
3415280	3418200	It's, snitching is probably justified then to-
3418200	3420360	Well, hold on, hold on, hold on, because here's the thing.
3420360	3423400	Even in a society where being gay is on the rise,
3423400	3426440	I wouldn't make it illegal to be gay.
3426440	3428720	But what if you, what if it's on the rise
3428720	3431400	so much that your people are suffering
3431400	3433960	and living in hell because of it?
3433960	3435800	How are they suffering and living in hell?
3435800	3439160	Oh, sir, like you're not gonna answer the question?
3439160	3439980	Okay, I got it.
3439980	3440820	I need to know how they're suffering
3440820	3443160	and handling in hell specifically.
3443160	3445000	Oh, did he actually leave this time?
3446800	3447820	Oh, shit.
3447820	3449440	Earlier it was just because his microphone
3449440	3454380	was getting cut off, but, well, that was fun.
3457840	3459600	So you talk to this guy a lot?
3459600	3461480	I've talked to him a couple of times.
3461480	3466480	He, he's like this very strange combination
3468260	3470680	of like, groiper and socialist
3470680	3475680	that I've never quite encountered before in my entire life.
3476680	3481680	Do you know who Big Papa Fascist Andrew Wilson is?
3482940	3484860	Yes, I kinda do, yeah.
3484860	3488440	Yeah, he got me to talk to him first,
3488440	3491180	and then it's just been this ongoing saga
3491180	3495500	of every once in a while he'll come through and talk.
3495500	3500500	But yeah, this whole conversation started out with him
3502040	3505260	complaining about getting a stalking charge
3505820	3509340	that he had to plead guilty to, and now I know.
3509340	3511300	He's stuck.
3511300	3513380	Some girl he knew in real life, I guess,
3513380	3516620	but like he denied the allegations, obviously.
3516620	3519740	But yeah, it's been,
3523500	3525920	this conversation's been going on
3525920	3528660	for the longest time between me and him,
3528660	3531000	where like, I'll say like, wow, you sound like a lefty.
3531000	3533140	Well, maybe not a lefty now.
3534100	3538300	He doesn't really have a full understanding
3538300	3539740	of what his own positions are,
3539740	3542180	except for like right now everything is bad
3542180	3544220	and it needs to be fixed.
3544220	3546900	And because it's all bad right now
3546900	3549220	and it all needs to be fixed,
3549220	3554220	we have to like fix it by tearing everything down,
3554620	3558780	which sounds a lot like a lot of the like tankies
3558780	3561780	I've talked to, where they know what their end goal is,
3561780	3564300	which is some sort of like socialist fucking utopia,
3564300	3566180	but like they don't have any plans
3566180	3567280	on how to actually get there.
3567280	3569700	What their plans are are to just like
3569700	3573300	destroy the entire system and then we'll go from there.
3573300	3576060	It's destroy first, fix everything later,
3576060	3578700	instead of just trying to fix what we have,
3578700	3580000	where we're at, you know?
3580980	3582060	Yeah, yeah.
3582060	3585340	He sounds, to use one of my own terms,
3585340	3587180	he sounds very post-fascist
3587180	3588900	in a lot of the things he's been saying.
3588900	3591600	I'm actually like really blown away
3592360	3593200	because I watched your video
3593200	3596040	that you linked to me a while back about fascism,
3596040	3600480	but you actually sound like you know
3600480	3602880	what you're talking about compared to like 90%
3602880	3606880	of everyone that I've ever talked to about fascism.
3606880	3608120	That's just an illusion, to be honest.
3608120	3610080	That's just an illusion.
3610080	3614000	I mean, you were bringing up all the like scholars and shit,
3614000	3615880	so you know more than I do.
3615880	3619160	Most of everything that I've learned about is all
3619160	3623960	just watching other people's YouTube videos.
3623960	3627840	And I guess I've read Giovanni Gentile.
3627840	3629680	Well, I listened to the audio book.
3629680	3634320	But yeah, I don't know.
3634320	3636520	I don't even have any like thoughts afterwards.
3636520	3639240	Like what do you think about that whole?
3639240	3640960	Well, firstly, I just realized
3640960	3643480	that I advertised going on your stream
3643480	3645840	as talking to a post-fascist.
3645840	3647240	So people probably think that you're one.
3647240	3650800	Oh, yes, I am the fascist that he's talking about.
3650800	3653280	All right, guys, fuck.
3655200	3659800	The thing is, I could like recognize a lot of of more
3660560	3662920	coherent points in what he was talking about,
3663360	3666160	but he couldn't you couldn't get them out, you know, like.
3667240	3669320	So there's an essay that Sargon wrote
3670440	3672720	for his website, that for Lotus Eaters.
3672720	3675800	And I think it was just, hold on, let me just I want to credit the right guy.
3675800	3677560	He has like a dozen people working for him right now.
3682080	3684000	I think it was Sargon.
3686040	3687840	No, it wasn't Sargon.
3687840	3689960	It was it was one of the people working for his site.
3690680	3693040	You know, he doesn't he has like a news outlet now, right?
3693040	3695240	Like that's his thing is doing the news. Oh, really?
3695920	3698880	Yep. Lotus Eaters dot com is his news outlet.
3699560	3700200	She does that now.
3700200	3701640	I knew that there was a podcast.
3701640	3706040	I've never like my my foray into politics
3706040	3709800	online came basically after the fall of the like YouTube
3709800	3712000	skeptics and Sargon and all of those people.
3712200	3715560	So like, I never really watched any of his stuff from before.
3716760	3718040	I was going to really fell.
3718040	3720200	He like he he got kicked off Twitter.
3720200	3722520	Everyone thinks that that's the same thing as dying, but it's not.
3723400	3728440	And then his channel, he didn't upload there very much for a while, right?
3728760	3732400	He got like he's actively blacklisted
3732480	3735440	or sorry, shadow banned on the Sargon like official channel.
3735960	3739920	So what he did was he got together some people that he knew
3739920	3742080	and he started a news outlet.
3742080	3745200	And now he does like a daily podcast over there.
3745560	3747760	He's kind of abandoned the Sargon name.
3747760	3750960	No, but someone on his site wrote an article
3750960	3754000	called The Universal Acid of Liberalism.
3754160	3756400	OK, and this this also applies to socialism, too.
3756880	3759760	I think this person used liberalism just to mean the left,
3759760	3762040	but it applies to liberalism and it applies to socialism.
3762400	3766120	And the and this is where like the gray sludge is coming from,
3766600	3771000	because there is an argument to be made that the the left
3771000	3773280	tends to universalize everything.
3773280	3776400	The liberals do this and socialists do this and progressives do this.
3776600	3777280	They all do this.
3777280	3781280	The idea is like, well, the same framework can be used anywhere
3781360	3785320	in any time and place with with any people, with any culture, with with anything.
3785320	3787920	You know, you can have a functioning liberal society anywhere
3788240	3790440	and cultural differences don't mean anything.
3790440	3793040	And that leads to a universalization
3793440	3796000	of a lot of the core tenants of society.
3796320	3801120	Now, to visualize this, the right wing people will often appeal to architecture.
3801280	3804920	Right. So British architecture looks different from German architecture,
3805640	3807760	which looks different from Chinese architecture.
3807760	3812320	And then you go to a modern city and it's all the same glass skyscraper.
3812320	3814280	And they're like, look, look at what has been lost.
3814280	3817120	Look at look at the diversity that has been lost when everything
3817120	3821360	is universalized into into a more left wing way of living.
3822360	3827120	And I think there's something to that critique that if if the entire world
3827320	3831920	was actually a socialist utopia, you probably would lose a lot of diversity.
3831920	3835360	I think like a lot of things that are particular to one location
3835360	3838120	or to one language or to one people or to one cultural practice,
3838400	3841640	you would have to lose all that thing because when things are equal,
3841640	3843000	they are the same.
3843000	3845080	And so you have to lose difference.
3845080	3848680	But difference is what makes is what makes life fun, you know?
3849000	3851000	Yeah, no. So I think there's something to this point of view.
3851000	3856320	And so when he talks about the the gray sludge, there is like
3856680	3860160	I've heard people describe Marvel movies as gray sludge
3860800	3863960	because they're kind of like a facsimile of a good movie.
3864360	3867440	Yeah, they hit all the beats, but there's no reason for the beats to even happen.
3867440	3869160	Like there's no artistry there.
3869160	3873320	So it feels like a lot of of at least
3873520	3877280	cultural leftism is just kind of like manufactured and fake.
3877440	3878760	You know what I mean?
3878760	3881720	Yeah, I I don't disagree with that. I feel like.
3886080	3889080	Sorry, I don't have my ADD medicine, so I want to like try my best.
3889080	3892320	So I haven't I've been I've been without Vyvanse for way too long.
3893000	3896280	So I I feel like there's
3896840	3899920	this like general feeling
3899920	3903920	of lack of purpose that brings people to
3905280	3907560	certain to these like more extreme positions.
3907560	3909640	And this isn't a hot take. Everybody thinks this right.
3909880	3912240	But yeah, I feel like the.
3914760	3916960	The two paths you can go down, right,
3917720	3920640	like either becoming like an ultra fucking socialist
3920640	3925520	or an ultra fucking fascist is really depressing and it's extra depressing.
3926280	3930680	When. The person doesn't even have that
3931120	3935360	that full worldview because you can't even attack their worldview
3935360	3936680	because it's nonexistent.
3936680	3938760	That's what the deal is with this guy.
3939640	3944480	I can't attack his like positions on like fascism or
3945160	3948640	or socialism because he doesn't believe in either necessarily.
3948640	3952080	He just believes, well, this is more fascist than socialist.
3952080	3955360	He just believes in like by whatever means necessary. Right.
3955600	3959560	So he could he's like a very strict consequentialist. Yeah.
3959600	3963240	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And.
3964040	3966360	Oh, fuck me. Sorry, playing Minesweeper two.
3968600	3972040	So like, it's really hard having conversations with him about politics,
3972040	3974960	even though like it's very fun and he gets like ultra like
3974960	3978840	upsetty spaghetti about things, obviously, but it's like
3979880	3984080	I don't even know where to begin because like I've done my own research into
3985040	3987800	into fascism so that I can push back against fascists.
3988000	3992320	I used to be a socialist, so I can push back against socialist shit a lot.
3993400	3995440	But goddamn, when I can't
3996320	4001040	pinpoint exactly like how to start attacking someone's
4002120	4006040	like worldview, I don't know how we can like move forward in the conversation,
4006040	4008160	because like again, he says like Grace Ludge, right?
4008160	4011840	Like at first it was literal, like they're feeding us Grace Ludge. Right.
4012040	4014640	And then it moves to McDonald's. Yeah.
4014680	4018560	Yeah. And then it moves to like, no, I mean, metaphorical Grace Ludge.
4018720	4020640	OK, well, let's talk about the metaphorical Grace Ludge.
4020640	4024280	And there's no actual position there to attack
4024280	4026960	because he just doesn't like what's going on now.
4027240	4030400	What's going on now is the problem. Right. Yeah.
4030640	4034280	Yeah. So I think part of it, well, actually, first of all, before we
4034720	4037440	even write this down so I don't lose it, we get into that.
4037440	4041360	Did you say that you disagreed with with the universalization take that I gave?
4042840	4045320	No, I don't necessarily disagree with that.
4045320	4046840	OK. All right.
4046840	4050640	So the universalization in terms of like people being
4052320	4055960	like the the Marvel movies, like it's like the Grace Ludge, like nothing is
4056560	4060480	like we don't have like individual like areas that have their own unique culture,
4060720	4065320	like like yeah, yeah, unique cuisines, dialects, et cetera.
4065320	4068880	And the worst part about that is that that kind of leads to,
4068920	4070720	you know, more ethno state thinking,
4070720	4072720	which can obviously go down a different rabbit hole.
4072720	4076400	But you also just can't have every everything and everyone
4076400	4079600	and everywhere be the same and everything operates into the same system.
4079840	4081440	Everyone thinks the same way.
4081440	4083080	That's not going to work either. Right.
4083080	4085240	There has to be some there has to be some difference
4085240	4088800	between different places and different different people, you know.
4090200	4093520	There's there's a there's a proper there's a proper balance
4093520	4098000	to be struck here between like complete exclusion and exclusivity.
4098200	4101400	And everyone kind of siloed off into their own bunkers
4101400	4102840	where they don't interact with each other.
4102840	4107200	And also everything being mixed together into one giant pot
4107200	4109160	where nothing even stands out anymore.
4109160	4110840	There's some there's some middle ground
4110840	4113160	we can reach here between those two positions.
4113160	4118120	Yeah, I feel like there's a lot of like like nerd culture things
4118120	4122440	that I used to enjoy because there was like a certain level of exclusivity.
4122440	4124320	Like there was like its own culture.
4124320	4126760	Like I used to like when I was in high school,
4126760	4129880	Warhammer 40K and D&D are like the two things that I've seen,
4129880	4131400	like a massive shift in culture.
4131400	4135680	And I feel like they've lost something because they've tried to universalize
4135680	4138720	the experience so that everybody can enjoy it. Right.
4139480	4141760	Yeah. So like Warhammer is for everyone.
4141960	4143600	You've heard that a few times. Yeah.
4143600	4145720	And I've argued. Well, no, it's not. It's actually not.
4145880	4149000	Yeah, it really isn't like look at the fucking price point.
4149160	4156080	But like the they're like one of the jokes in like D&D circles
4156080	4159960	that you used to see were like the you know, someone would invite their girlfriend
4159960	4163760	and she wanted to be like, you know, a fucking vampire and a werewolf
4163760	4166320	and a fucking fairy and like
4168120	4170920	it like technically it's possible. Right.
4171720	4175000	And so like the people who like, I guess like what you're saying,
4175000	4177440	like the universalization of all these things, people would say,
4177560	4180520	well, it's it's technically like possible to happen in the game.
4180520	4182240	So there's nothing wrong with with that.
4182240	4185120	But it's like, OK, but it's kind of taking away some parts of the game
4185120	4189080	for like other people if like they can't if we have to like
4189320	4193400	find like all these esoteric rules to make this like very hyper specific thing happen
4193560	4196280	or in like Warhammer 40K like you like see people
4197160	4202160	like they've kind of taken the edge of the like actual like fucked up shit
4202160	4205240	that the entire setting is based off of. Right.
4207360	4210200	You kind of like push that to the background,
4210200	4212600	like they're not trying to like explicitly get rid of it,
4212600	4216600	but like kind of implicitly because like the there's like the huge push
4216600	4218840	for like female space Marines and all that stuff.
4218840	4221240	And, you know, like they,
4221240	4226920	you know, like all the Xeno like xenophobia, like literal xenophobia,
4226920	4231120	fear of like aliens and anything outside of the Imperium, like where like
4231120	4234520	it feels like they're trying to like pull back into like a.
4236640	4239440	Technically, like more
4239440	4243880	original Warhammer 40K aesthetic where they were like trading with aliens
4243880	4248080	a little bit, but then they kind of moved into like the extra grim, dark shit.
4249560	4251920	So like they're trying to like bring in like the like
4251920	4254880	maybe not all of the mutants are bad and, you know.
4255080	4258080	So I understand what you're talking about with that.
4258080	4260280	That's my my spiel on that.
4260280	4262440	80 D minded. Right. Right.
4262440	4263640	No, I get it.
4263640	4267560	There's like people there with Dark Souls, right? Mm hmm.
4267880	4269720	We got to make Dark Souls more accessible.
4269720	4270920	And it's like, well, actually, no, you don't,
4270920	4273600	because the whole point of it is to be hard and inaccessible.
4273600	4277360	And that's like if you if you make Dark Souls, but easy, what do you have?
4277840	4279880	Right. Like a pretty generic game, you know, like
4280880	4284680	inclusivity is not always a good thing.
4285080	4287680	It can often be a good thing, but it's not always a good thing.
4287680	4290960	And I think that's something that the left has to has to grapple with
4290960	4293800	because they think it's it's always good all the time to get more people
4293800	4295960	included and involved. And it's like, well, not necessarily.
4296240	4297720	Sometimes you have to gatekeep.
4297720	4300240	Sometimes gatekeeping is good, you know?
4300240	4301840	Yeah, for sure.
4301840	4304640	In terms of the gray sludge as food
4305760	4308280	conversation, that's like the bugs.
4308480	4309560	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
4309560	4311280	Well, to be fair, I've had bugs. I don't like them.
4311280	4313720	I'm not going to ever actually eat the bugs.
4314000	4318440	But like, there's this idea, especially in right wing spaces,
4318800	4321000	that things have become too easy.
4321400	4323920	You know, that that science and technological advancement
4323920	4325280	have made things too easy.
4325280	4327000	So he brought up fast food.
4327000	4329040	And the problem with fast food
4329040	4332200	is not just that you get fat and unhealthy while you eat it.
4332240	4334320	That's a pretty big problem, but it's not the only problem.
4334320	4339120	Another big problem with it is that it makes getting food too easy.
4339120	4341160	You know, people are too divorced
4341160	4344400	from the actual labor that creates the food and it makes them kind of feel
4345840	4347920	there. You know, there's like this there's this view
4347920	4350960	on the right of the liberal elite or the leftist elite, right?
4351120	4353400	The people who are
4353400	4356280	like kind of hypocritically very far left.
4356320	4360440	Therefore, they're very in favor of these of these redistribution schemes
4360440	4362040	or they want overt socialism.
4362040	4365560	But at the same time, they're also the elite that would be destroyed
4365560	4367040	by their own policies.
4367040	4369600	And the right kind of views them as this way. Well.
4370560	4375720	The right considers the reason that that that that that hypocrisy exists
4375720	4380520	to the right is because they've become so divorced
4380520	4383320	from the labor that actually keeps them around.
4383560	4387040	So you have like a modern society, you have specialization of labor.
4387320	4390960	So people, you know, I don't have to go out and grow my own food anymore.
4391040	4395320	I can do a very niche job and get very, very good at one specific thing
4395320	4397440	because somebody else's is growing more food.
4398400	4402600	Have you seen that graph where it showed the percentage of a country's workforce
4403200	4405000	in agriculture over time?
4405000	4407480	It's a very famous graph. Have you seen that?
4407480	4409800	It describes what now?
4409800	4413600	Killing percentage of people
4413600	4416840	in agriculture over time, as they can find it.
4417280	4419560	It's a very famous.
4419560	4421840	Like stark graft, is it here?
4424120	4426440	OK, here.
4426440	4429280	This is from our world and data, and I'll post this.
4429920	4431120	So check this out.
4432320	4435240	What you see. Is as.
4435240	4439920	Um. Basically, as countries modernize,
4440280	4443680	the number of people working in agriculture drops drastically
4443760	4447040	because you have fertilizer and you have you have farming equipment
4447520	4451600	and you have you have all these you have you have basically the infrastructure
4451600	4455400	to support less people growing way more food and also transporting it
4455400	4459320	around a whole bunch of factors and refrigeration and all that shit. Yeah.
4460200	4464200	Yeah. So basically what this means is you have you have an entire labor force
4464200	4465760	that isn't growing food anymore.
4465760	4469000	It's not involved in producing food in any way so they can specialize
4469000	4472240	so they can specialize in becoming whatever, you know.
4472440	4475280	And as soon as we had more advanced machines, we have more specializations.
4475280	4478280	That's why you have people being YouTubers now, the most useless job.
4478640	4482560	And yet I can make a living off of it because the essentials
4482760	4486920	in the workforce have been covered so efficiently that we can
4487320	4490280	people can just do almost whatever they want compared to 500 years ago.
4490360	4493240	You know, it's kind of it's insane how far we've come.
4493720	4496040	However, what this leads to is
4496720	4500880	a complete lack of knowledge or a lack of a lack of knowledge.
4501000	4504160	So, for example, like, have you heard this is a very common story.
4504400	4509000	You hear like the extremely intelligent university math professor
4509480	4511800	who says you don't need to hunt.
4511800	4512880	Why does anyone still hunt?
4512880	4514880	Just go buy your meat from the grocery store.
4514880	4516240	Why are we still killing animals?
4516240	4518160	It doesn't make any sense. Just get it from the store.
4518160	4519600	You hear that a lot, right? Yeah.
4519600	4523040	And it's that actually people do actually say that it's because they're so
4523080	4525320	specialized in one domain.
4525960	4528200	They have no clue where their food comes from. Right.
4529040	4533080	And so this kind of this being so divorced
4533080	4537160	from what keeps the underpinnings of what keeps society running
4537520	4542080	leads to the right wing thinks leads to a sort of liberal elite
4542080	4545480	class of people who are very domesticated.
4545880	4549880	They're very they're unable to really like do physical labor
4549880	4552000	for themselves, keep themselves alive if they had to.
4552000	4554600	And some in some sort of post-apocalyptic scenario.
4554960	4557880	But they're very specialized in one like technical skill. Right.
4557960	4561720	Yeah. And we've like that has always existed in some way, shape or form,
4561720	4563760	as long as we've had like cities and stuff.
4563760	4565640	But it's more and more pronounced.
4565640	4569280	The more industrialized we get, the more people can specialize
4569480	4571880	into like very, very hyper specific fields.
4572600	4575240	And so like the perception is that like we've become
4575360	4579040	a very weak society for sure. Yeah.
4579400	4582960	And so there's like I think it was Kierkegaard.
4583000	4584600	Kierkegaard said something like,
4584600	4587320	my job is to make everything worse for people,
4588000	4590200	which is a pretty extreme statement.
4590400	4596640	His entire like outlook on life is just like the like everything sucks.
4596680	4599320	My life sucks and I'm going to be very sad about it. Right.
4600080	4600880	Kind of. Yeah.
4600880	4604600	But but his point of view was that he believed we would reach a point
4604840	4607320	in our scientific development
4607360	4609600	that things would get too easy.
4609880	4614240	And in fact, it would be we would have a better time if things were harder.
4614680	4620040	And I think right wingers view that the modern era as being that tipping point.
4620240	4623400	And that's why a lot of them talk about fast food, because you can get people.
4624360	4627160	Who because people are, you know, they're dumb and they're weak
4627160	4630440	and they have shitty morals and they're not able to do what's right all the time.
4630680	4633120	So they're going to go get fast food whenever they're
4633280	4635600	whenever their willpower, you know, wanes.
4635920	4638080	They're going to take the path of least resistance
4638280	4642640	and they're going to literally eat slop because it's cheap and it's plentiful.
4643000	4646920	And like what kind of person is capable of not doing that?
4647240	4650240	Well, it does actually seem to be a reasonably special kind of person.
4650560	4654200	So there is almost like a a natural hierarchy
4654560	4658080	between people who have more willpower and people who have less willpower.
4658080	4662080	And a lot of a lot of the current right wing paradigm relies on this point of view
4662080	4665280	that society is has made things too easy.
4665520	4667760	And it's created a bunch of soft people.
4667760	4670320	And that kind of actually bears out in some of the data.
4670360	4673000	Yeah, it's probably not as harsh as they think, but there's something to it.
4673000	4675840	But I would also say that like a lot of people on the right, like they
4676520	4678320	this is something I said earlier, right?
4678320	4683240	Where they the right, especially like 2010 to 2019,
4683520	4686520	like their whole thing was like, I'm not going to be made a victim.
4686680	4688080	I'm not a victim of the system.
4688080	4691120	I picked myself up by the bootstraps, you know, like their entire thing
4691120	4693640	was like not being the fucking snowflake.
4693640	4697280	And I got about like four or four posts
4697280	4700280	into the Twitter files before he called me. But it.
4701280	4703880	But like my perception of the Twitter files,
4703880	4706520	and again, I haven't read very much of them at all.
4707040	4710800	I read the full first one when it was being released one sentence
4710800	4713160	at a fucking time and I didn't read any of the rest of them yet.
4713600	4718680	But like their their whole thing was like, well, now like
4719360	4722360	conservatives are seeing themselves like as the victim and like
4722680	4723840	rallying behind that.
4723840	4727960	I would say that like everybody everybody sees themselves as a victim,
4728760	4731880	but they the the people that they're saying
4731880	4735080	are like victimizing them are like very different.
4735280	4739400	And so they see themselves as being better as the other victims.
4739880	4742240	You know, does that make sense?
4742240	4744720	Yeah. Yeah. A lot of people tend to
4745600	4747320	this almost seems almost like a universal thing.
4747320	4748960	I'm not sure if it is, but it seems very common.
4748960	4752720	At least people tend to derive some sort of moral justification
4752720	4753760	from being a victim.
4753760	4759280	You know, if you if you go to like an like a very rigidly Islamic society,
4759280	4762840	you know, like I'm not talking like like your average state in the Middle East.
4762840	4763600	I mean, like ISIS.
4763600	4766680	I go to go to go to an ISIS controlled area if they still controlled locations.
4766680	4768920	Right. And you talk to them about what's going on.
4769120	4772360	They would often appeal to the fact that the West has victimized them
4772360	4775760	and therefore they are justified in, you know, implementing Sharia law.
4775960	4777400	They'll they'll have other.
4777400	4781960	They do that in China as well with the whole like opium wars and shit like that.
4782880	4784400	You know, we have been victimized.
4784400	4788480	Therefore, we can now, you know, push forward our ideas.
4788720	4790600	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
4790600	4796400	So I think there's because people I think I think this is actually
4796400	4800400	this might even just be a a human thing, like a naturalistic thing,
4800400	4803360	because people, you know, have have compassion.
4803720	4804880	They have pity.
4804880	4809280	I think there's definitely just a sense that if you can be a victim,
4809280	4812240	that gets you political power and the left does it, the right does it.
4812400	4814280	Everyone does it, you know?
4814280	4816400	Yeah, no, I think that everybody does it.
4816600	4818640	And that's something that like
4818640	4822760	I was trying to explain to him that like before he jumped in, like when
4822920	4825680	like I'm starting to get more into like real world politics,
4825680	4828560	especially as I like get further into my degree, political science.
4828560	4831120	Right. As I heard, I heard you talk about Georgia.
4831280	4832320	Did you join?
4832320	4834760	Did you go with destiny down to that?
4834760	4837320	By the time I actually decided I was going to go, they said,
4837320	4839880	like, please, no more people. We have too many people.
4839880	4844560	So there was a splinter like DGG group that was helping in Augusta.
4844960	4847120	And so I was there. So, yeah.
4849560	4853400	I was trying to explain to him, like, if you if you like want to
4853400	4857120	like do something like you can, there are things that you can do, right?
4857120	4862200	Like stop like sitting here in like boo hooing about how like mean the world is.
4862440	4867760	Right. How bad the the society that you live in is and actually like go and try
4867760	4871600	and, you know, advocate for like your hyper specific,
4871840	4875480	you know, like whatever policy that you think is like the most important to pass.
4875480	4879200	Right. But more and more, especially as like
4879440	4882800	people get like these grand narratives around politics
4882800	4886440	and as they like see the world around them in like a very specific way,
4886480	4888680	depending on who they're watching, like
4888680	4892880	Vaush viewers are fucking like super far lefties, people who are watching infrared.
4893080	4895720	They just feel like you have to tear down the whole fucking system.
4895960	4899840	Well, maybe not Vaush viewers like Vaush is at least smart enough to say
4899840	4902280	like we can like go incrementally.
4902560	4906160	Although I don't know why I watched that.
4906200	4909640	I watched that Vaush versus Rose Wriste from a few months ago,
4909640	4913200	and he was like straight up like, nope, it's time for a revolution.
4913640	4917440	Democracy has failed boys about like shooting conservatives out of the windows.
4917440	4919200	But I don't know, like
4919400	4923640	I haven't watched him since like, fuck, beginning of 2021.
4924200	4930000	But like at least back then, he was more like incrementalist
4930000	4933080	and like violence when like.
4934040	4937480	Absolutely necessary, or like when there's going to be some sort of,
4938080	4943160	you know, takeover of the government from a socialist revolution or in self-defense.
4943200	4947200	Now, he would make the argument that the trans genocide is going on right now
4947200	4950000	is like self-defense to start like doming
4950000	4953280	all the fucking Republicans that are in your in your vicinity.
4953280	4957400	But like stop being that fucking victim
4957400	4960920	and stop crying and whining about how the entire system needs to be brought down.
4961080	4965720	Look at what the situation actually is instead of like the grand narratives
4965720	4969640	about like the fucking Jews owning the fucking like means of production
4969640	4972880	and the fucking banking system and like pushing down white people
4973000	4975920	or stop looking at the world as if like there are like three people
4975920	4980080	who are like a shadowy cabal, like meeting in their like pedophile sex
4980080	4983560	dungeons to figure out what like a horrible piece of legislation
4983560	4987720	they're going to do to ruin poor people's lives and like actually go out there
4987720	4992280	and like do something and like advocate for some sort of like policy or some shit.
4992280	4995200	Right. But they don't want to hear that.
4995200	4999200	They don't want to hear like do something that is an actual solution to a problem.
4999360	5002680	They want to tear down literally everything and.
5003680	5006440	You know, like whatever happens afterwards,
5006440	5008640	that's when we'll start dealing with it, you know?
5009440	5014880	Yeah, a lot of them are taking the anti-democracy pill just because
5014880	5020480	and I do mean this simply and only because their ideas aren't popular.
5021400	5025240	Like if any of this shit on either side was actually popular,
5025240	5027160	it would win elections and it doesn't.
5027160	5028480	It's as simple as that.
5028480	5029840	It's not a failure of democracy.
5029840	5031560	It's not the system rigged against you.
5031600	5034200	You know, it's no one is stuffing the ballot boxes.
5034520	5038000	You know, it's not like it's not like judges are are somehow biased against you.
5038000	5039800	It's that no one likes your ideas.
5039800	5041760	Yeah, exactly. That's what I told him.
5041760	5044920	Like nobody wants to live in this fucking fascist, fascist,
5044920	5047800	theocratic fucking world where like
5048920	5051440	you have no choices about like what you're able to do.
5051600	5054080	Like look at all the things that liberalization has gotten us.
5054080	5057560	Like we have like cheaper consumer goods, cheaper electronics.
5057560	5060520	You can buy cars a lot cheaper, although maybe not in the past two years
5060520	5062320	because of supply chain shit.
5062320	5063960	Right. Like cars are cheaper.
5063960	5065000	Housing is not cheaper.
5065000	5066360	That is a failure of democracy.
5066360	5068600	And I was I was like, holy shit.
5068720	5072320	Yeah, it Dev knows way more about this shit than me
5072320	5076320	because I probably wouldn't have like thought to like bring up the
5076840	5081240	the failures of democracy to like explain how our system is still working
5081440	5083320	as intended. Right.
5083320	5086440	But like the the whole like.
5087320	5090640	The whole thing that like they.
5092040	5095600	They ignore all of the good that liberalization has gotten us. Right.
5095760	5099320	And they just want to like, yeah, imagine what like a utopia
5099320	5105000	would be under their hyper specific, you know, niche political ideal is.
5105280	5107960	Right. And it's really fucking blackpilling to me because.
5110120	5111840	I feel like.
5112360	5114880	I I tried to.
5114920	5118320	If I'm being like completely honest, I think I tried to force myself
5118320	5123000	to be a socialist when I've always been a like hyper liberal. Right.
5123200	5125760	Like, I've always believed that people should have like the right to own guns.
5125920	5127760	I've always believed that people should have the right to like
5127760	5129640	open up a business if they fucking want to.
5129640	5132880	Well, you know, I but like the.
5134640	5138240	Nicer talking points of socialism, where like everyone has the
5138360	5143360	the means to like live a good and happy life, you know, the you know,
5143360	5148480	like maybe we could like take care of utilities for people and like nationalize
5148480	5152920	those like the like soft socialism things are the things that kind of won me over.
5152920	5155320	And then, you know, as I learned about actual economics,
5155320	5159760	then I moved back over to where I was in high school. Yeah. Yeah. Like.
5162400	5164080	I kind of lost where I was going with that,
5164080	5169680	but like the overarching thing is like the the the liberalization of the world,
5169680	5173000	especially in the West, has gotten so much good shit.
5173000	5177960	It's just like I wouldn't have been able to afford the fucking computer that I have
5177960	5183360	right now if it wasn't for like, you know, globalized fucking trade,
5183360	5187600	being able to, you know, like Taiwan making the fucking computer chips
5187600	5192760	and they're mining the lithium and fucking what, Bolivia or whatever the fuck.
5192960	5197360	Like if that wasn't happening, then this computer would cost like four hundred
5197360	5201240	thousand dollars, right, because they would have to like source
5201240	5203920	like the three percent of the world's
5203920	5208880	lithium out of like four countries that still do trade with us. So, yeah.
5210640	5211520	No, I know what you mean.
5211520	5216240	I mean, Lord Tennyson's pipe in the chat, he says just because goods are cheaper
5216240	5218880	doesn't mean that we are living better, more meaningful lives.
5218880	5222080	A meaningless life is an unfree one because we're trapped with our desires.
5222360	5223440	There's some truth to that, right?
5223440	5227120	Like liberalism has unleashed this incredible productive power
5227680	5230160	and socialism would just destroy it.
5231240	5234960	But the issues that we're facing now, they aren't productive in nature.
5235320	5237880	And, you know, more capitalism won't won't fix it.
5238040	5240360	Socialism won't fix it either. Socialism will make it worse.
5240640	5242680	We're facing a different problem now.
5242680	5246360	But it's a problem that I don't think people on the left have any solution for.
5247360	5249720	Because now we're talking about metaphysics, right?
5249720	5251120	We're talking about meaning.
5251120	5255360	And this is a materialist analysis can't get you to the solution of this problem.
5255680	5259440	Right. If you're just focusing on, well, oh, number goes up, paycheck goes up.
5259440	5262840	More stuff. Everyone has has has better quality of living.
5262840	5264920	Well, it's like, OK, that's good.
5264920	5268120	It's not nothing, but it doesn't bring meaning.
5268160	5269320	Yeah, it doesn't get you.
5269320	5272320	It doesn't get you like the happiness of like hanging out with your friends
5272320	5275320	and having like those experiences with them or like meeting someone
5275320	5276480	and like settling down
5276480	5278720	and having like a life with them if that's what you choose. Right.
5278880	5280600	It doesn't get you that sort of thing.
5280600	5283760	But it certainly makes a lot of those things like easier
5283760	5285800	if you're able to afford to go out with your friends.
5285800	5289160	But I think that like the biggest thing
5289160	5293640	that is like lost us meaning is like how interconnected we are like.
5293760	5296240	And that's ironic coming from someone that likes to stream
5296240	5299480	and like post YouTube videos and argue with people about politics. Right.
5299480	5302320	And I'm talking to people from Australia and fucking.
5302480	5306720	I'm talking to you over fucking discord on in Canada and fucking like, you know,
5306720	5310880	like the hyper interconnectivity of everyone kind of
5311600	5315040	expands our social circles to such a degree
5315200	5318000	that we don't have like the like more personal
5319320	5321200	relationships in our everyday lives.
5321200	5323880	I think that so many people are lacking right now.
5324080	5327800	And I've like with that guy, I've talked to him like multiple times about this.
5327920	5331920	Like, hey, like, do you have friends in real life that you talk to
5332000	5335480	that like aren't online, like telling you that you need to like
5335640	5337640	kill all the Jews or some shit? Right.
5337640	5340280	Do you have people in your everyday life that would be like
5340920	5344080	sad if you like went and shot up a school like because like
5344440	5347720	it he's kind of like alluded to shit like that before.
5348640	5351200	Like it's like this.
5351200	5353760	Like, do you have these kinds of like
5353760	5357080	real life connections that you can actually feel happy with?
5357080	5359920	And I, I never got a straight answer for him.
5360040	5362880	But I know like I look at online and all the like,
5363680	5367280	like extreme like lefty, like trans people
5367280	5370200	that I have argued with, like and lost my twitch because of.
5370400	5373360	And it's like these people don't talk to people in real fucking life.
5373360	5375320	All of their friends are on fucking Discord.
5375320	5377640	And like, it's good to have friends on Discord.
5377640	5379760	I like talking to people on Discord. It's very fun.
5379760	5383760	But like I go out and I fucking, you know, like I go to my my friend's house.
5383760	5385160	I went to his house last night.
5385160	5388360	We fucking played music and we played fucking video games
5388360	5389680	like right there next to each other.
5389680	5392240	We didn't do it over the over fucking Discord.
5392240	5394240	So we actually have that human to human connection.
5394240	5397640	You know, I go out with my friends and I like we go bar hopping occasionally.
5397880	5400440	Like we invite people over to our house to,
5400440	5402920	you know, to socialize and actually, you know.
5404320	5407960	Have these like human experiences that people
5408800	5411000	I think took for granted,
5411000	5415320	and they think that it can be like one to one replicated online.
5415560	5418160	Right. Look at all the people who are doing long distance
5418160	5420920	dating and having like e-boyfriends and e-girlfriends.
5421200	5426320	Like it's it's not the same as having someone like that's there every day
5426320	5429760	with you and like like having the physical touch and shit like that, you know.
5431200	5432280	Yeah, yeah.
5432280	5437480	I you know, I'm an I'm an atheist, but at the same time, I do think that
5438040	5441840	now that I'm a little bit older than, you know, my my edgy 16 year old phase.
5441880	5445520	Yeah, I do think that something was probably lost
5445520	5449120	when church became not so popular anymore,
5449680	5452320	because even like, OK, you don't believe in God, you believe in God.
5452320	5455040	But like it was definitely a community that was there.
5455040	5457760	You know, you could go to a church, see everyone in the community
5457760	5459160	once a week, touch base.
5459160	5460200	You don't got to hang out with them every day,
5460200	5462480	but like maybe maybe there's a guy you don't normally see all that off.
5462680	5464000	You see him at church once a week.
5464000	5468240	You can connect with your community, get a little bit of moral instruction
5468360	5471880	from from the priest, you know, spend your Sunday morning like.
5472440	5474920	I've heard this take before and I grew up.
5474920	5480320	My dad was a pastor for most of my life, and I out of everyone in my family,
5480320	5483040	I've had like the least engagement with with church stuff.
5483200	5485440	But I see like my older and my younger brother.
5485480	5488440	They both have, you know, friends that they made in church
5488440	5492040	and they had, you know, like lasting friendships with people
5492040	5495600	that they met at like summer camp at the like church events and shit. Right.
5495800	5498760	Like my my dad is like organize all these youth groups
5498760	5502440	and like the the people from those youth groups still message them on Facebook.
5502440	5505760	And, you know, whenever they come into Texas and they
5506400	5507360	they'll come and visit them.
5507360	5510240	And like there are long lasting,
5510240	5513400	you know, connections that you can make with real life fucking people.
5513640	5515080	Right. Yeah. Through church.
5515080	5516520	And like I had never got that.
5516520	5519000	So like a lot of my friends came from online.
5519000	5522240	Right. But, you know.
5522240	5523880	Well, the thing is, it doesn't have to be church, right?
5523880	5526760	You have it like a community center, if you're like some sort like
5527320	5529760	there's like Italian centers, Ukrainian centers, you know,
5530000	5532600	there's there's these places for like immigrant groups.
5532840	5534920	There's you can get it in the military.
5535000	5536800	You can join boy scouts if you're a kid.
5536800	5540360	Like there's all of these institutions that exist in our society
5540840	5545480	that seem to be crumbling with with atomization.
5545960	5549000	And a materialist analysis will not help that.
5549000	5551240	And I don't think the left has a solution for this.
5552000	5554200	But but the right the right talks about community.
5554240	5555760	It talks about community building.
5555760	5558880	You know, it talks about all the stuff, you know,
5558880	5561880	the right's very community focused, is very local focused.
5562320	5565400	And I think they probably have solutions to the crisis
5565400	5567320	of meaning that are better than leftist solutions.
5569000	5572320	Yeah, I don't know how we like get people to
5573320	5579560	form those IRL connections, because like I know that there's like
5579560	5582520	two community centers that are walking distance from me. Right.
5582880	5587600	And I there's I don't ever see anybody there
5587600	5590960	unless it's like, you know, Election Day. Right.
5591880	5596600	So I don't know how we can like actually like pull people to go there
5597240	5599360	and like get those kinds of messages out.
5599360	5603400	Like, I know that they have little like luncheons and shit
5603400	5605120	and events and stuff like that.
5605120	5609240	But I don't I don't think I know a single fucking person has ever gone to
5611200	5613560	to like a community center for
5615160	5616440	anything other than voting.
5617960	5619080	So, yeah, I know what you mean.
5619080	5620720	Same. I think it's like an old person thing.
5620720	5623680	And, you know, in twenty five years when they're all dead,
5623680	5626560	it'll probably be something that's like sorely missing from society.
5627560	5633320	Yeah, I feel like a lot of the people that I want to like talk to,
5634200	5637320	especially because it's like all of the fucking content that's online right now.
5637480	5643360	But the red pill shit that's trying to give young men some meaning in life.
5644360	5647480	I'd love to talk to either like a supporter of like the like,
5647600	5650760	you know, Andrew Tate or fucking fresh and fit or like one of the
5651040	5654600	because there's no way I'm going to get into a conversation with any of like
5654600	5657720	the medium or larger size YouTubers unless I
5658960	5661400	just go like apeshit on them on Twitter and
5662840	5664560	somehow like pull a conversation.
5664560	5668040	But like, it'd be so interesting to like talk to them about that sort of thing.
5670600	5674640	Well, to be fair, Andrew Tate and Andrew Tate and fresh and fit,
5674640	5677160	there's a pretty big gap between those two.
5677160	5677840	I know what you mean.
5677840	5679600	But like, yeah, yeah, yeah.
5680560	5683600	Secondly, I saw not so erudite on fresh and fit,
5683640	5686200	and she did a pretty good job going back and forth with one of them.
5687080	5689640	So I think I know I think I know the kind of
5689640	5691600	I think I know the kind of conversation that you're looking for.
5691600	5694080	And I think she did a good job at that because she brought up
5694080	5697080	like traditional values and it kind of, you know, OK,
5697920	5699960	here's here's what I'll say about fresh and fit.
5699960	5701080	All right. They always say,
5701080	5704800	man, we are representative of what women actually think,
5704800	5707640	because we got all these women here, they're from different countries,
5707640	5710320	different classes, different education levels, different races,
5710680	5711920	all these different types of women.
5711920	5713200	So we get everyone's opinion.
5713200	5714840	And it's like, well, hold on.
5714840	5717560	You don't get opinions from women who wouldn't go on fresh and fit.
5718280	5720080	Yeah, it's a pretty big demographic.
5720080	5723800	People who wouldn't subject themselves to being on that fucking show,
5723800	5727720	you know, because Jesus Christ, like, mocked by like five like ultra
5727720	5730080	red pillars telling them that they're like roasties
5730080	5732560	who like slept with too many fucking men and shit.
5732760	5735040	You know, like, I, I wouldn't want to be a woman
5735040	5737440	and go on that fucking podcast for goddamn sure.
5737880	5742840	But but when when not so erudite walked into walked into the Wolf's Den,
5742840	5745760	you know, she did pretty well for herself because she she had the data.
5745760	5747720	She had she had her own experiences,
5747720	5749560	which are very different from everyone else's there.
5749560	5751400	She she's not a Miami girl, you know? Yeah.
5751400	5754200	So I think that was actually a very interesting conversation.
5754720	5758560	I actually all have to watch that thing because I
5759480	5763240	when they were first starting to go on to the fresh
5763240	5765280	and fit panels like Destiny and erudite and,
5766960	5769440	you know, all these things, Nico was there, too. Yes, Nico.
5769680	5771680	I cannot stand, Nico.
5771680	5777440	But my secret seems like a young lost guy who will come around eventually.
5777560	5782440	I hope so. I the only interaction I've ever had with him was bullying him
5782440	5785600	off of a panel on Destiny's stream, like one of those impromptu things
5785600	5787840	after a Mr. Girl conversation. But
5790240	5792920	yeah, like I was so like.
5792920	5797160	Uninterested in those conversations at the at the beginning,
5797160	5800880	but now it's like it's all fucking encompassing, right?
5800960	5803320	Like I can't escape it. It's everywhere.
5803680	5808800	And so now like now I'm interested because one of the one of the reasons
5808800	5813440	I started getting into like streaming on on Twitch and doing politics and stuff is
5814040	5818840	I knew a couple of people that were like relatively like normal dudes
5818840	5820320	in high school, right?
5820320	5824360	Like pretty chill dudes, nice guys, upstanding citizens.
5824560	5828840	And they like became like ultra far alt righty like neo Nazi.
5828840	5832280	I think one of them might have been at Charlottesville
5832280	5833800	or maybe he had friends at Charlottesville,
5833800	5837200	and maybe that's why he posted about it so much on Facebook. But he is.
5837240	5841480	Yeah, like they like went super, super, super far right afterwards.
5841480	5846280	And the the reason for that, as far as I can tell, based off of their posts
5846280	5849400	and the arguments I would get into with them, like in 20,
5849560	5852560	you know, 2017, 2018, 2019
5853560	5857080	before they blocked me was like they
5857400	5860840	they just had like nothing going for them, like despite everything
5860840	5865200	like being great for them and in high school and like all the life prospects
5865200	5868320	that they had, like going into
5868320	5873400	into adulthood, like all of that kind of just washed away.
5873400	5876240	Part of that is because they were like throwing their lot in with Nazis
5876240	5878320	and people knew who the fuck they were. But like,
5879560	5883640	like the the the lost young man
5883640	5889640	kind of, you know, stereotype is one of the reasons why I got into streaming.
5889920	5894040	And it's
5895640	5899840	I feel like a lot of people for I feel like part partly
5899840	5903600	because of like the coronavirus stuff in 2020 and then
5903800	5906480	21 came around and people kind of forgot about like,
5906800	5912320	you know, men's issues are like really, you know, fucked up right now. Right.
5913040	5916440	Now that it's coming back around now,
5916440	5918680	it it's piqued my interest.
5918680	5922400	And I I don't know, I
5922400	5924600	I feel like I want to have those conversations,
5924600	5927640	but they're like very difficult to
5928680	5932360	to find with the audience that I've kind of gathered
5932360	5938520	and then lost and then rebuilt after the switch from socialism to liberalism
5938520	5944040	and based trans advocate to genocide denier and all that shit. So.
5946240	5950160	Man, the trans genocide conversation is so fucking ridiculous.
5950160	5952680	I hate that one. It's insane.
5953640	5956800	But in terms of man, I do know what you mean.
5957320	5961880	Like it's not the left that caused all of these problems for men,
5961880	5963560	though they definitely caused some of them for sure.
5963560	5966400	However, the the main denial
5966600	5969920	that the problem even exists is 100 percent from the left.
5970320	5974080	And so I think there's an entire generation of young men
5974080	5976200	who are just never going to be left us because of that alone.
5976440	5979320	You know, when they were at their lowest point,
5979520	5982960	they were told by this group that all of their issues didn't exist.
5982960	5986640	And they're all just misogynists for having the issue in the first place.
5986640	5989960	And it's like, well, that you're not getting them back.
5989960	5991440	They're gone, you know?
5991440	5995040	Yeah. And I feel like
5995040	5998120	with me growing up, I never really
5998120	6001000	because I just like wasn't on the Internet until like twenty
6001920	6003960	twenty seventeen, twenty eighteen.
6003960	6008000	I didn't see any of like the like feminists,
6008000	6011240	like, you know, attacking men all the time. So I never
6012600	6015200	so I was like one of those liberals who was like, yeah,
6015200	6018320	what fucking problems do you have? Like, well,
6019000	6022280	I didn't understand that until I started,
6022520	6025320	probably until like I started streaming or watching people
6025320	6027480	that like got me into streaming. Right.
6029000	6031480	Because the the environment
6031480	6034440	that I grew up in was just like very chill.
6034600	6039280	I never like my my family have always been very, very liberal,
6039280	6042960	very, very, you know, pro LGBT
6042960	6046640	and like anti anti racist and all this shit, you know,
6047320	6050600	very not conservative in almost any way, shape or form.
6051840	6055480	So I grew up in that bubble and then like getting exposed to like.
6056640	6062080	The online sphere initially was like of a massive shock
6062080	6065120	because there are all these conversations that were being had online.
6065120	6067880	I was like, these are not real issues. Right.
6068760	6072520	And to a certain degree, I still think that like most of the things
6072520	6075240	that people talk about online are not real issues.
6075480	6079840	But there are some that either aren't an issue,
6079840	6082560	but there's a grain of truth in there or there's
6083680	6087240	there is an issue that's been like blown up by it,
6087240	6090960	like the like virulent fucking arguments
6090960	6094200	that happen on Twitter and on fucking the streams and shit
6094400	6096520	that people think that they're much more of an issue that they are.
6097640	6100680	So like, I think that there are there are issues
6100680	6103520	with men right now that need to be addressed.
6103520	6106000	Like they don't have very much meaning.
6106000	6110160	You know, women are outpacing them in like academic endeavors.
6111360	6114320	They're being out earned by women more and more and more.
6114840	6118800	And so like there's like that aspect of like trying to find a partner
6118800	6121240	that wants to be with you if they're earning,
6122040	6125480	you know, if they're earning more than you than like, are you like actually a man
6125480	6129200	or will they even date you if you if they have a bigger paycheck than you?
6129200	6132920	Because people generally want to like date up or date at their level,
6132920	6134520	not date down.
6135480	6138120	But yeah, it's just like
6138760	6142080	it was a very strange culture shock coming into the Internet
6142080	6144080	and seeing these conversations, especially like
6145520	6149520	revisiting older like destiny content or revisiting
6150000	6153520	like I've gone back and I've watched some of the old like skeptic videos
6153920	6157920	out of curiosity five years after the death of that, you know,
6158920	6162120	huge bubble online with all the Ransonas and stuff.
6163400	6165400	And it it.
6167000	6169000	It's just a very
6169560	6172160	strange thing to see, like how like I grew up
6172800	6176440	in in this area, never seeing these issues, then seeing everybody
6176440	6178560	talk about these issues like they were the biggest things in the world.
6178720	6182160	And then like now we're at this place where we're revisiting some of those issues.
6182880	6188720	And some of the like conversations about it have become this like ultra fucking
6188760	6193760	like weird MGTOW, like just fuck as many women as you as you can growing up.
6193760	6197840	And then, you know, like once you're ready to settle down, like find yourself
6197840	6201560	like a 19 year old woman who's never fucking had a relationship
6201560	6204200	in her entire life and marry her because she's pure.
6204200	6207920	And then on the on one side of the aisle
6208080	6211680	and then the other side of the aisle saying like men have no issues whatsoever.
6211680	6214400	And women are like the like most oppressed group on Earth.
6214400	6218240	And it's just very strange to see how the conversation has evolved.
6218240	6219080	You know.
6220000	6221760	Yep, that was long, so I don't know.
6221760	6223240	Sorry. Yeah, exactly.
6223240	6226960	Again, like no medicine, I hopefully inshallah tomorrow.
6227760	6229520	I do pretty much agree.
6229520	6232480	I mean, I was one of those skeptics back in like 2014.
6232480	6234000	I was I was in Gamergate.
6234000	6236080	I remember I'm old enough to remember that shit.
6236320	6240160	I mean, my first time on the Internet was like 1997.
6240160	6242760	I was a kid, but still, I'm I'm pretty old now, you know.
6242880	6245120	How old are you old enough?
6245360	6247040	Old enough. Old enough.
6247040	6248760	I was I was a 90s kid for sure.
6248760	6250920	And there are so many zoomers right now who don't remember
6250920	6253080	what it was like before 9-11, which is wild to me.
6253400	6255200	I guess this is what it's like getting older, you know?
6255200	6257040	Yeah, I was born in 95.
6257040	6262480	And like I I got just like the tail end of like the good times.
6262680	6267360	And then like everything since like 9-11 has just been like like a shit fest.
6267360	6270760	Like I feel really bad for my little brother because he was born in 99.
6271000	6274840	And so he doesn't remember before 9-11 and he missed all of it.
6274840	6277000	He missed all he missed all of the good shit.
6277200	6279600	And then like everything from then on, like
6280240	6282480	especially with my family being so politically active, like
6282720	6285800	it was like constant in the household, like arguing about this stuff
6285800	6289360	and seeing it happen on TV and all that shit. So.
6290400	6293880	So for me, the most striking thing
6293880	6297520	is how many of those old skeptic conversations
6298360	6300840	we were right about speaking as a former skeptic.
6300840	6302440	We were actually correct about a lot of them.
6302440	6306320	You know, back then, it wasn't it wasn't an alt right joke.
6306320	6310600	It was just one of our jokes was the attack helicopter gender thing.
6310600	6314360	Yeah. And then and then it became an alt right thing.
6314600	6317720	It's like, oh, my God, only only like racist Nazis make that joke.
6317720	6321360	And that and now now you have demon mama on stream
6321360	6324960	saying attack helicopter gender is legitimate. Yes.
6325280	6328880	It's like we we knew that
6329200	6332400	this philosophy was going to lead to this point eventually.
6332400	6335280	And we called it like almost a decade ago.
6335960	6339560	We knew it was going here and it went there, you know, like.
6340440	6345320	So I'm at some I've been I'm being urged by chud logic
6345520	6348800	to eventually compile all the information that I have
6349320	6353360	on why there seems to be a section of the left,
6353760	6357520	not all the left, but a section of the left that is extremely pro pedophile
6358400	6359640	and why that's the case.
6359640	6362360	Very strange. I have
6362360	6364560	and I'm going to I'm going to put that together
6364560	6368640	and put it out because there's a philosophical backing behind it.
6368800	6371400	There's a bunch of literature, a bunch of political science literature
6371400	6372000	that I can put out.
6372000	6374000	It's like, well, here's here's what this guy said.
6374000	6375560	And here's how how it influenced this guy.
6375560	6376960	And here's this guy.
6376960	6380760	And it runs directly down through the heart of postmodernism.
6381640	6385440	Yeah, because you have guys like Foucault and Derrida who are out there like
6386120	6389720	like fucking fucking boys and was in Tunisia or something.
6389720	6391120	And they're advocating for
6391120	6394160	age of consent to be revoked as part of the socialist project.
6394440	6398600	Because as it turns out, the class of adults and the class of children
6398600	6402280	also need to be equalized and have the power imbalances removed.
6402560	6404520	Like it's it's it's insane.
6404800	6406040	It's insane, right?
6406040	6410400	But there is like political science, texts and literature and essays
6410400	6413080	and books written about the stuff that I can put forward and be like, OK, well,
6413280	6416320	here's how this mindset might lead
6416320	6419520	and has led to this thinking in some people today.
6419960	6422520	And I think I can put together a pretty decent case.
6422520	6425000	So Chud, Chudlogic is like, you got to do this video at some point.
6425000	6425960	It's going to be spicy as fuck.
6425960	6427960	And I'm like, yeah, I know why you want me to do it, right?
6428800	6430040	I understand that.
6430040	6433400	Yeah, I'm I'm I'd actually be interested to see that.
6433400	6437480	I'm like 50 50 on like looking at
6438480	6442760	philosophers from like the like 1800s to the mid 20th century.
6443480	6447800	And trying to like follow like a direct line of
6449040	6451560	like secession to like see where we're at now.
6452920	6455120	Like especially like
6455120	6457680	being someone who's like interested in going into education.
6457680	6460160	I want to like like teach at the high school level.
6460960	6464280	I see all these people talking about like groomers in schools and stuff.
6464280	6468200	And do you know the Fabian Liberty guy? Yep.
6468320	6472520	Yeah, he has he seems like one of his like biggest issues is like
6473080	6476440	the the postmodernist, like socialist agenda
6476440	6479520	in in schools to groom children into being socialists.
6479800	6482400	And like you can.
6484160	6488200	Find like some parts of some philosophies
6488200	6491000	from postmodern thinkers in.
6491960	6496040	In some like initiatives like social, emotional learning,
6496040	6498360	which I need to learn more about
6498360	6500760	in these like initiatives.
6501000	6504160	But like I I don't know how much I'm sold on it,
6504160	6509440	like being like this like grand agenda that's been like spanned spanning.
6509520	6511360	And I don't think that's what you're saying.
6511360	6514040	But like there's like this like.
6514040	6516800	Thought right now, especially like James Lindsay and people like that
6517120	6520040	who are like saying like there's this grand
6520840	6524880	initiative from socialists to like make everybody into these
6525600	6527840	critical thinking
6527880	6530240	people who are.
6530240	6533440	You're talking like Biden's 1619 projects, stuff like that, right?
6533800	6536800	Yeah, like they're like, yeah, there's like critical race theory
6536800	6537720	and there's critical theory.
6537720	6540600	And like they're trying to like push this on to like young kids
6540600	6543200	to do like certain things
6543200	6546040	to like either like indoctrinate them
6546040	6548640	into gender theory or some shit like that.
6548880	6552760	And I don't I don't know how sold I am on that, like coming from
6553160	6556080	like working in elementary schools and like seeing
6556080	6558280	what is actually being taught in elementary schools.
6558880	6559920	Granted, I'm in Texas.
6559920	6562360	So like maybe that like skews my
6563240	6565080	maybe the things very like hard.
6565080	6567720	But so I don't see I think there's some of it.
6568160	6570160	Karl Marx and shit, you know.
6570160	6574000	I think there I think there's definitely some people who do that,
6574360	6576440	like there's going to be some individual teachers
6576440	6578720	who who are absolutely biased in that direction.
6578720	6580720	They absolutely want to do that sort of thing.
6582120	6584640	I don't think they constitute like a
6584640	6587640	they can actual conspiracy of an organized group
6587640	6589480	to actually do all this sort of stuff.
6589480	6592400	But I don't think they have to because they all have the
6593360	6594560	the same training, the same education.
6594560	6597320	They all kind of have the same ideas, so they do it in a decentralized way.
6597760	6600920	However, I do think something
6601400	6605520	I do think it's much more prevalent at the university level than it is at the.
6605560	6607560	Yeah, at the grade school level.
6607560	6609000	And the university level, it's all over the fucking place.
6609000	6610440	It's everywhere in the university level.
6610440	6612400	I don't think that it's common.
6612400	6616840	Like I've had out of all of my professors that I've had in Poli Sci,
6616840	6619200	I think I've had one conservative,
6619200	6622120	two centrists and all the rest of them seem to be like lefties.
6623000	6626280	So like, I definitely do agree that there's like a bias
6626280	6629360	in academia for like left leaning opinions.
6630960	6632840	But I don't think that it's
6632840	6634440	and again, this is like all anecdote.
6634440	6638040	I can't speak for every college campus or anything like I don't.
6638040	6641320	I don't feel like it's ever been to a point where people can't
6641320	6645080	think for themselves or like get low grades because they're conservative
6645080	6645840	or anything.
6645840	6650000	I but then again, I don't know what all the arguments about like academia being
6651320	6654520	skewed in one way or another are, so
6654520	6657520	I think the academia being skewed in one way or another, that's
6658040	6659800	that is an important conversation.
6659800	6663600	And yeah, I mean, even though I'm a bit older, I do remember seeing it happen
6663600	6665560	when I went when I went to university, you know,
6665560	6667600	people having the wrong opinions and getting less grades.
6667600	6671240	I did see that it was mainly in the gender studies courses.
6671240	6673080	I took, though, not in anything else.
6673080	6675800	Oh, really? Yeah, I haven't taken any of those.
6675800	6677960	So luckily,
6679360	6681840	but I think like when it comes to the whole groomer thing
6682400	6686800	is like the one that I like to talk about is the case in California
6686800	6688440	where there were two
6688440	6691480	there were two gender queer teachers at an elementary school
6692000	6696040	and they were using their authority to basically spy on students.
6696360	6699520	They would go in, they'd log in with with their administrative
6699520	6703080	and their administrator password or whatever into the schools
6703320	6704920	in the school computer system.
6704920	6709160	They would see they would like look at the key loggers of various student logins
6709520	6711840	and see what and see what these kids were talking like.
6711840	6716160	Probably grade two to grade six, you know, so reasonably young.
6717040	6719880	They would see what these kids were doing.
6719880	6722040	What they were searching on Google using the key logger.
6722360	6725080	They would pick out people who were searching about things
6725280	6728000	that might have been related to gender or trans stuff
6728160	6732400	or like like gay questioning or whatever things that could be construed in that way.
6732720	6735040	They would pick those people out, write down their names for later,
6735240	6738560	and then single them out at some point and invite them to
6739640	6741800	to a gender club.
6742320	6746520	And this club was not the school's normal, the normal pride club.
6746520	6748600	It was like their own thing that they had been running on the side.
6748960	6752720	And once in that club, these two teachers would convince these kids
6752720	6755920	that they're trans and tell them not to tell their parents, because if they
6756320	6759640	it because of the nasty Republicans in the government,
6759880	6763480	if you're if anyone learns that you're trans, you'll be taken away from your parents.
6763880	6766560	So the only person that you can tell is is us.
6766880	6768520	And like they would love bomb them.
6768520	6770720	But then they would also say, listen, it has to be a secret.
6770720	6773680	And it ended up getting to like there's this one.
6773960	6777440	There's this one little girl who they tried to convince very strongly
6777440	6779840	that she was that she was a trans man.
6779840	6781960	She was not she turned out just to be bisexual.
6782520	6784160	She found out a little bit later in life.
6784160	6786200	But eventually this all blew up and it was discovered.
6786480	6789920	And these two these two teachers are now being
6790280	6793400	dragged through the legal system as they should, because that's pretty monstrous
6793400	6795960	what they did. But here's the thing.
6795960	6797360	I can tell you that story.
6797360	6799640	And it's a it's a case of legitimate grooming
6800080	6803080	happening by by these two terrible teachers. Sure. All right.
6803320	6806720	And it had its 15 minutes of fame on lives of TikTok and all of it.
6807240	6812240	However, because that story is so sensationalist, it sticks in people's minds
6812240	6815120	and people think, oh, this is every time I see. Yeah.
6815120	6818480	Yes. Every time I see, you know, a blue haired person on Twitter
6818680	6821720	who hangs a Black Lives Matter flag in their in their
6822040	6824640	their classroom, regardless of whether or not that's appropriate.
6824840	6828000	The fact that they're doing they must also be secretly grooming kids, too.
6828080	6831320	And everyone that I see on lives of TikTok has to be secretly grooming kids.
6831480	6835040	And as soon as you see like even 20 legitimate stories of it happening,
6835200	6837200	you think it's happening everywhere.
6837200	6842080	But 20 stories in a nation of 330 million people isn't actually that many people.
6842400	6843920	You know, it's still bad,
6843920	6847280	but it's not happening at the rates that right wing people think it's happening.
6847280	6848400	One thousand percent.
6848400	6851080	That's exactly what I mean, because every single time this topic comes up,
6851240	6853800	I say, like, can you show me any example of this happening?
6853800	6857520	Like at like a district wide level where this is like some sort of policy
6857520	6861160	that they're like going forward and like, you know, having clubs
6861160	6863960	where like people come out as trans and give them hormones
6863960	6866520	or give them like the information of how to access hormones
6866920	6868160	without their parents knowledge.
6868160	6871520	Can you give me any like curriculum that's being implemented
6871520	6873880	in like either a state or a local level?
6873880	6878480	That's like like trying to like indoctrinate people into gender theory,
6878480	6882840	fucking, you know, critical theory, critical race theory shit.
6883040	6884480	Like, can you show me any of this shit?
6884480	6887160	And like, I might get like one example of like a teacher
6887160	6889240	going like a little bit too far or like doing something
6889240	6891760	that's like pretty objectively horrible, like
6892640	6894720	depends on like what the scale of it is. Right.
6896560	6899760	Or like a charter school, like an individual school
6899760	6903480	that does not like that is not beholden to like a whole school
6904280	6906120	school wide system
6906520	6909520	implementing something, but never something on like a grand scale.
6909520	6911920	And that's what I would have to see in order to be like, OK, yep,
6911920	6914200	we've gone too far. This is this is fucking crazy.
6914400	6916920	I think that individual teachers absolutely should be like
6917560	6922280	should use much greater discretion on when and where to talk about
6922280	6925360	like sexuality and shit like that, because there are like
6925520	6928440	there are some things like there are famous authors.
6928440	6930040	I don't know.
6930040	6932240	I can see his face, maybe Oscar Wilde,
6932440	6934920	who was a gay man or a bisexual man or something like that.
6935040	6936360	And that might have called you gay. Yeah.
6936360	6939040	Yeah. That might have colored some of his writing.
6939040	6942520	And maybe that's something that is relevant to bring up in a certain context.
6942520	6945680	Right. And that shouldn't be like off limits to talk about.
6945880	6949160	But like if you're like teaching fucking math, like there's no reason
6949160	6951440	to like talk about fucking like gender shit. Right.
6952200	6955480	Like even in biology, I don't think that that's necessarily
6956040	6958400	a good place to talk about it.
6958400	6962400	But if you're like taking a health class, that's probably like more appropriate
6963080	6965720	to talk about that, depending on what the age level is
6965720	6967880	and what the conversation is. Right.
6968040	6970680	It has to be like matched to like the appropriate age level
6970680	6973120	and the context of what it is, you know.
6974560	6978680	But yeah, like every time I ask for any kind of example of this
6978680	6982480	happening at mass scale, I never, ever, ever get examples of it
6982720	6985000	except for like a lives of TikTok tweet.
6985280	6988200	And that like bugs the fuck out of me.
6988400	6991960	That like we can't, you know, pass anecdote. Yeah.
6993040	6996320	Even if you assume that every single case
6996320	6999920	on lives of TikTok is exactly as she presents it,
7000400	7004720	that's still not enough to say like there's a huge problem in America.
7004760	7006200	That's still a minority of people.
7006200	7008560	You know, it's still bad, still has to be stopped.
7008600	7011320	But it's not like it's happening everywhere all the time.
7011560	7013960	And therefore, you need to pull your kids out of school immediately
7014240	7015400	or else they're going to turn gay.
7015400	7017400	Like that's that's a bit too far for me.
7018000	7020480	Yeah. What do you think about all the
7020480	7022480	the like conservative parents saying that we need to
7023400	7026040	pull all of our kids out of school and start homeschooling them?
7026880	7029080	Because it feels like if anybody is talking about
7030200	7033640	like actively politically grooming, even if we're not talking about
7033640	7036520	like sexually grooming, like politically grooming children
7037080	7040760	into some sort of ideology, it would be the people who are like, no, like the
7041200	7046120	like the the tested curriculums that are being taught in public schools
7046120	7047280	across the country.
7047280	7050240	That is that is way too far left.
7050400	7053480	We're going to teach people about like our version of history.
7053480	7055080	1776 project.
7055080	7060280	Let's fucking go at home and don't interact with anyone that disagrees with you.
7060880	7065280	To be honest, I actually don't necessarily mind the idea of 1776.
7065360	7068720	I mean, you should probably be taught the good things that America has done
7068720	7069520	in its history.
7069520	7072920	You don't need to be you don't need to be bludgeoning kids at five years old
7072920	7075280	or seven years old or something about all the negative stuff
7075480	7078000	that can wait until they have some more critical thinking skills.
7078000	7079120	You know, you should.
7079120	7081960	High school is probably where you should start talking about like
7082240	7085280	slavery in detail or like the yeah, yeah.
7085320	7088000	Native American genocide shit that happened, you know, like
7089640	7091680	but for me.
7093920	7097440	And again, like maybe I maybe I'm just old and this isn't what they taught us
7097440	7101960	and when I was in school, right, I'm 27 years old and I'm old and have arthritis.
7102160	7106760	But I don't feel like I was ever like bludgeoned
7106760	7110200	with how bad America was and like I graduated in 2014.
7110200	7112640	So like there was a lot of like the Tumblr shit going on.
7112640	7114640	Maybe it's changed a lot since then.
7114640	7119160	But yeah, it feels like people aren't being taught
7119440	7121560	just like how evil America is.
7122480	7125480	Maybe there are young people in chat that can.
7125480	7128920	Disagree with that, but it feels like there's a pretty like.
7129920	7132640	The slavery, slavery was bad
7132920	7137520	and it was bad to be a clan member, and like that's about as as like.
7137520	7140120	So I was in high school.
7140120	7142480	I was in high school in the mid 2000s.
7142480	7145280	And I remember.
7145280	7148520	I remember a teacher, it was in a civics class,
7148520	7152800	it was last year of high school for me in civics.
7153360	7156000	And a teacher says.
7156040	7159840	And she was in retrospect, she was she was very far left, even for the time.
7160200	7162760	And she said, well.
7162760	7165600	It's completely fine for black people to say
7166480	7169400	black pride, but white people can't say white pride.
7170240	7172640	And then she talked about the intersectional reason as to why
7172640	7176080	and you know, who has historically had power and all this stuff.
7176280	7178800	And I was like, well, that sounds kind of stupid, right?
7178800	7180280	And the entire class like that sounds stupid.
7180280	7181800	Shouldn't it be equal for everything?
7181800	7184840	We were all we're all like liberal normies, right?
7184880	7186520	So that that all sounds kind of stupid.
7186520	7188480	And she was like, no, that's how that's how it is.
7188480	7189480	And she was like,
7189480	7193040	she she got so much pushback from the entire class that she dropped it.
7193520	7195480	So this was mid 2000s.
7195480	7198880	So there was at least one person in my experience trying to push it
7198880	7200440	and it wasn't really sticking.
7200440	7203360	But then by the time I got to I went to university, dropped out,
7203440	7206880	went back to university on my second time through university.
7207400	7210880	It was completely it was completely
7211760	7214440	it was all intersectional and everyone was cool with it.
7214440	7218800	And if you if you gave a non intersectional take in a lot of these classes,
7218800	7221640	you would actually get punished for it by the professor. So
7222560	7226440	I have seen the progression of things and how things have changed over time.
7227320	7230920	So I do think it's probably gotten even more in
7231000	7234400	in that direction since we've both left school. Yeah.
7234680	7238120	If you were to go into into like a high school class right now,
7238120	7241080	they're probably actually here.
7241240	7243520	I I was searching this up.
7243520	7244880	I don't know if you've seen this.
7244880	7247080	You mentioned math, right?
7247080	7250680	Oh, is this going to be like the black kids can't learn unless they're dancing thing?
7251240	7255360	No, no, no. The the deconstructing racism in mathematics.
7257240	7260400	You see shit like this all the time, all the time.
7260400	7263360	And like, even if there's something of value in here,
7263680	7267360	the when something like this goes viral on Twitter, you're like,
7268160	7271160	you're like, what the what the fuck? Why is this?
7271560	7276040	You know, why is there a greater like this is like a criticism in regular math.
7276040	7278240	There is a greater focus on getting the right answer
7278240	7281240	than understanding concepts and reasoning. And it's like, well.
7282320	7283880	Talk about math here, you know?
7283880	7289200	Yeah, I do have to I could I could steel man that it's not necessarily wrong.
7289520	7293680	But fuck the framing of it, like as dismantling white supremacy
7293680	7298320	is so fucking dog shit like the the steel man of that that I would give is like
7299320	7303440	there are a lot of I was able to pass all of my math classes in high school,
7303440	7306000	but I did not understand the fucking concepts.
7306200	7308600	OK, I like memorize some of the fucking
7309600	7311440	formulas and I just,
7311440	7314720	you know, plugged and played and like prayed to get through it. But.
7316480	7320200	I feel like I would probably be like significantly better at math
7320200	7324360	and probably a smarter person overall, if I was able to understand the concepts
7324360	7327680	and the reasoning behind like why we get to this point, like I
7328640	7332280	I recently had to learn some of the oh, shit, what do they call it? The.
7333760	7337360	Oh, there's like a kind of like doing a way of doing math
7337360	7341360	that triggers the fuck out of conservatives and like older people nowadays.
7343440	7345400	It's going to kill me until I get
7345400	7350640	until someone says it, but I'm like, like seeing how like they're teaching math
7350640	7353960	now in elementary school, it's like, oh, that's how I do math in my head. Right.
7354880	7357720	And like this is like a really great way
7357920	7361560	to like teach people from a very, very young age. Right.
7362360	7365320	Well, Common Core, thank you, Sir Wolfgang based
7365880	7369080	like the Common Core thing is like actually super fucking base.
7369080	7370680	It's honestly super cool.
7370680	7375600	And the strategies that they're teaching kids using Common Core is really, really
7376240	7379600	like a great way to build those critical thinking skills at a very young age.
7379840	7384400	But like the the framing of the like picture that you sent,
7384400	7387560	like the dismantling white supremacy in math classrooms
7388120	7391560	is so unbelievably fucking cringy.
7391760	7395040	And like there's another streamer
7395880	7399840	that I've argued with in the past and that just argued with Kefle's poly people
7400120	7403600	who I've noticed this big trend with lefties where like
7404200	7408200	we can't argue like the the actual topic that we're arguing about
7408200	7412080	because I have to like move five or six layers of separation
7412080	7415040	away from that thing in order to argue about white supremacy.
7415240	7419280	And I feel like that is a dog shit way to explain the world to most people.
7419440	7424600	Right. Outside of like hyper academic circles that are trying to explain,
7424680	7429880	you know, like expansive sociological issues. Right.
7431600	7435160	So like I could I could understand what they're saying here,
7435160	7439320	but like to call it white supremacy, to get the right answer is so fucking stupid
7439640	7442680	and it makes the left look so fucking retarded.
7443680	7445480	Well, so you've seen this then, right?
7445480	7447680	Because this is kind of where that comes from.
7447680	7449880	This is from the Smithsonian in 2020.
7449880	7451880	This is a very well known thing that got pulled.
7451880	7454640	It was like a. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
7455240	7459360	So white culture is individualism and having a nuclear family.
7459360	7461040	Emphasis on the scientific method.
7461040	7464760	Predecent work, work ethic, hard work is the key to success.
7464960	7466200	Work before play.
7466200	7468320	If you didn't meet your goals, you didn't work hard enough.
7468520	7470240	Like how is that whiteness?
7470240	7472920	Are you saying that nonwhite people are lazy? Like what?
7473440	7476000	Yeah. Oh, my God. Messaging.
7476200	7479600	But because it like fits into the kind of
7481320	7484200	ideals that they're trying to push, like to try like
7484400	7487520	because I feel like when I started being a leftist, the critiques
7487520	7490560	that were being levied were relatively reasonable.
7490560	7492960	Maybe there were like a couple of things that might have been a stretch,
7493080	7495120	but they were like relatively reasonable.
7495120	7500880	But like over time, since, you know, like 20, fuck 2016
7501560	7504440	when I started getting Trump got elected and everyone went insane. Yeah.
7505000	7508200	Well, yeah, I hate to say it like that, but
7509280	7512240	like there was probably a lead up, especially online,
7512240	7515160	that I wasn't aware of because I just wasn't an online person.
7515360	7518760	But like when I was like watching YouTube videos,
7518760	7520960	it feels like so many of those things were like relatively reasonable.
7520960	7523120	Like, oh, we can look at like how,
7524800	7528760	you know, Jim Crow laws could still affect people nowadays. Right.
7528920	7531520	OK, that's pretty reasonable. I can understand how that happened. Right.
7531680	7535520	But then like it kept on going forward and kept on going forward. And.
7536560	7541120	You know, I can like see the through line of how people got to the position
7541120	7545480	that we're at now with like working hard as white culture. Right.
7545880	7549720	Or like being on time is white culture, like that thing says.
7549920	7554400	But it's just just a fucking insane way
7554400	7557960	to frame all of our conversations around white supremacy.
7560040	7563080	And it's because because of that
7563080	7567840	conversation was being had in 2015, 2016, 2017. Right.
7569960	7572680	People really know these arguments in and out. Right.
7573200	7576360	And that's all they can argue, because that's what they've been hearing
7576360	7579160	for the past, you know, nearly 10 years.
7579640	7581800	And so, yeah, because that's all they've heard.
7581960	7583440	That's all they know how to argue.
7583440	7585560	And that's because it's all they know how to argue.
7585720	7590040	Every conversation has to be brought back all those layers of separation
7590040	7593920	to the original like seed that was planted in your mind.
7593920	7598440	It's depressing as a left leaning person.
7599160	7600960	So so when I mentioned earlier
7600960	7605160	that that we saw this coming like eight, 10 years ago,
7605560	7607280	this is another one of those things that we saw coming.
7607280	7611320	We like we there you can probably go find like 2014, 2015
7611320	7616960	era Sargon videos where he says one day the left will just be openly anti white
7617480	7619000	and it will be because of this reason.
7619000	7620960	And they're not there yet, but it'll be because of this reason.
7621360	7623000	And it turns out that's where we are. Right.
7623000	7626000	And I'm reminded of.
7626000	7629480	To bring back the Internet's oldest boogeyman, Anita Sarkeesian,
7629880	7632520	I'm reminded of that lecture she gave in 2015,
7633120	7636480	where she talked about like linking up her feminism with socialism
7636760	7639360	and how there has to be a true anti capitalist revolution.
7639360	7641760	And I'm like, listen, no one watched this fucking thing
7641760	7643360	because no one actually cares.
7643360	7647320	But she was saying this in 2015 and no one was listening
7647400	7648800	and people weren't really doing it,
7648800	7650760	but they were eventually going to bring it there.
7650760	7652520	And they did eventually bring it there.
7652520	7654720	And it's like I said, with the attack helicopter thing,
7654920	7657720	it went from being a joke to something somebody's
7657720	7661440	actually advocating for because it's the natural end result of their logic.
7661720	7664320	And I think that that.
7665480	7668640	Modern leftism in its current form
7668960	7671440	that we're seeing right now in the English speaking world
7671880	7675360	was always going to lead here from where it was 10 years ago.
7676320	7679240	Because it's just the natural end result of that logic, you know, if.
7680280	7683960	You have intersectionality and then you have certain privileged groups
7683960	7686720	and they're privileged because they're historically been underprivileged.
7686720	7689240	And so we want to kind of equalize the playing field.
7689600	7693360	You just take that point of view to its natural end result and you get this.
7693360	7696680	You get all the shit that no one actually wants and no one actually believes in,
7696680	7699000	except for the most the most crazy ideologues
7699160	7701000	and also those people who benefit from it.
7701000	7703520	But like, it's it's not good. It's not good where we are.
7703520	7705640	The main reason one of the main reasons
7705640	7708560	that I'm not a leftist is because of this shit, right? Yeah.
7708800	7711720	The second a second big reason is because I was told a lot
7712040	7713800	that I'm a liberal, not a leftist.
7713800	7715200	And I was like, OK, fair enough.
7715200	7717480	If being a liberal means that I'm on the right, then fine, I'm on the right.
7717520	7718720	I don't care about that.
7718720	7720880	You know, I don't give a shit about the label of left.
7721080	7723440	Yeah, I for me, like.
7726080	7727360	I feel like.
7728600	7733360	Being being brought up as like a like a hardcore Democrat, right,
7733360	7737880	like family ran for Democratic office and shit and like.
7737920	7739560	So there was always those conversations,
7739560	7742200	like the the path to like becoming a socialist,
7742200	7745200	especially as like an ultra like young person
7746720	7749800	was like pretty clear, especially
7749800	7754600	like going back to the whole like lack of purpose in young men's life, like the.
7756360	7758520	Trying to find like solutions
7758520	7762040	for the the woes of the world was probably what got me there.
7764160	7766640	But I guess I had a lot of young people.
7766640	7768800	Yeah, a lot of people are like that. Yeah.
7768800	7772200	And I feel like I I had more faith
7772200	7776280	in people to like be reasonable about a lot of things
7777400	7779760	until like really recently.
7779960	7783240	I felt like eventually like, OK, well, this is really fucking stupid.
7783240	7785120	But most people don't think that.
7785120	7790120	I would I I think I would disagree that like the left is openly anti-white.
7790160	7793120	I think that that's still like an ultra contentious
7794240	7797240	topic in leftist circles.
7797240	7801280	But like the the further left you get, the more that you do see people
7801280	7804600	like actually just like actually being racist towards white people.
7804600	7806360	It's like actually fucking insane.
7806360	7808400	The kinds of shit that people will say.
7808400	7812960	I learned some racial slurs for white people I didn't even know fucking existed
7813160	7817680	until, you know, like I started arguing with people online, you know.
7819200	7823480	So. I think I know what you mean.
7823480	7825560	Yeah, I think I know what you mean.
7826560	7827560	Shit, what were you saying?
7827560	7829160	What do you say like three sentences ago?
7829160	7830600	Because I had something I want to jump in with.
7830600	7831600	I didn't jump in.
7831600	7836160	I talked about starting off as a as a like hardcore Democrat,
7836160	7839200	the obvious path to socialism. Yeah.
7840480	7842400	Was it before or after that?
7842400	7844040	I was after that. Yeah.
7844880	7847280	Talked about how. Fuck.
7847800	7852640	There's a the left is it's a contentious topic of being anti-white.
7853640	7855520	It was before that, it was right in the middle.
7855520	7858080	Oh, you know, here, I'll just go back and listen, I guess.
7858120	7860640	OK, I'll look at chat for a second.
7860920	7862640	I'll mute for a sec.
7864320	7865920	Let's see here.
7869640	7872400	If it's a white person would be late for an appointment,
7872400	7875840	I'd be oppressing people of color because it would be so fucking stupid.
7876920	7881320	Hey, guys, if you guys if you guys haven't already subscribed, you should.
7882640	7886320	I got banned off of Twitch because of really stupid reasons.
7886520	7888960	So this is now my only streaming platform
7889520	7892400	besides like comfy dot stream or whatever the fuck.
7892640	7895720	So subscribe, we're going to be putting out more videos.
7895720	7899800	I have a. An editor and all that shit.
7902720	7904200	Let me see here.
7907120	7909800	Man, I can't I can't re find it.
7909800	7911440	My brain's not bringing it back.
7911480	7913120	Oh, damn. Thanks. Sorry.
7913120	7915200	I guess this is just gone.
7915200	7916360	I guess it's just gone. All right.
7916360	7919440	P. Oh, shit.
7921720	7923880	Man, was there anything else?
7923880	7928440	Sure. I don't have anything unless there's
7929280	7931560	something specific that you want to ask me.
7932240	7935960	I know Stardust was she really wanted us to talk, but Stardust isn't even here.
7936720	7939040	Well, the reason for that was
7939040	7942000	on election night in November,
7943560	7947560	I was just like panel hopping, just like seeing what everybody was saying.
7948680	7952920	And we were going to be on the same panel, but then she jumped onto yours.
7952920	7957080	I was like, OK, well, if he's if he has an open spot, see if he'll have me on.
7957840	7960600	And she said that you thought that I hated you.
7960720	7963080	I was like, I don't I don't know who the fuck this guy is.
7964000	7967880	That was back from when you because I think in 2020 or something,
7968200	7972320	you were more of a socialist and we had had to get back and forth on Twitter.
7972800	7975840	Yeah, I know exactly what the back and forth was because like
7976000	7979160	I didn't know who the fuck you were, but you posted about like selling your website.
7979160	7982840	I was like, I should I should buy the I should buy the
7983520	7986680	domain name and have it linked back to my Twitch channel.
7987400	7990040	So I don't think I was it to sell in 2020.
7990800	7993520	Was it not that because that's the only time I've ever
7994400	7997840	in that's the only like thing that I remember interacting with you on.
7997840	8000280	But keep in mind, I've gone through like
8000600	8002680	I go through a new Twitter account every six months or so.
8002680	8003760	I always get banned.
8003760	8006080	Well, so it
8007240	8010320	yeah, no, it was definitely it was definitely something very socialist, though.
8010320	8013800	And I was like, oh, yeah, I've probably said some really fucking retarded shit on Twitter.
8013800	8018520	And but yeah, I've moved on.
8018520	8021720	I've grown as a person, as a political thinker, you know.
8022240	8025000	So, yeah, you've cucked out to the system.
8025000	8027240	You're not a true revolutionary anymore.
8027240	8030320	Yeah. No, you see, like as you get older, you
8030600	8033440	you start getting comfortable with all the things that the system gives you.
8033440	8037080	And then that's the only reason that I've gotten to this point is because I'm
8037520	8041840	exploiting the the proletariat with all my bourgeois money
8041840	8045600	that I'm making off of my YouTube, getting me sixty dollars a month. So
8048520	8050600	fuck. Oh, man.
8050600	8053560	So have you seen that that Trotsky bit about
8054880	8059400	small businessmen, small business owners being being fascists?
8060480	8061840	I have not.
8061840	8064680	I never got like so deep into socialism that I knew like
8064960	8068080	all of the different like thinkers positions on things.
8068280	8074000	I think that my that I was like a total vosh
8074360	8078480	brained, you know, market socialist for the longest time.
8079280	8082920	I just liked things that sounded nice to like the the most amount of people.
8083520	8088480	But then I started getting like as I started getting bigger on stream,
8089600	8091840	I started getting into conversations with people that were like
8092840	8094640	more and more difficult to argue against.
8094640	8098520	And as like those arguments started, like
8099160	8101920	I started getting blown the fuck out, especially like capitalism
8101920	8106360	versus socialism debates, because I didn't know anything about capitalism.
8106360	8111960	I had to do like more research into like specifically it was economics
8111960	8115920	and philosophy that those two topics
8116720	8120120	made me like understand like, oh, I can't do this.
8120120	8122440	Socialism stuff like I can't like
8124160	8127400	I have no basis for any of the things that I'm saying.
8127400	8129080	Like, I don't believe any of these things.
8129080	8131760	I didn't realize that this is what I was like talking about, you know?
8132600	8136240	Yeah. And yeah, I don't like market socialism.
8136240	8139680	Is is that philosophy that I know a lot of socialists
8139680	8142960	want to use market socialism just to back a door in like further
8143240	8145120	more crazy variants of socialism.
8145120	8149080	But even markets like it sounds it sounds good to the normies,
8149080	8150560	but it still doesn't work.
8150560	8152560	You know, it still just falls apart.
8153600	8155960	And, you know, the idea that, OK, you have a government
8156160	8160400	and the government is going to legally mandate that all businesses be worker
8160400	8163200	co-ops is the most basic form of market socialism, right?
8163600	8167600	So that doesn't actually work, because like, how do you expand a business?
8168000	8170520	Well, you don't because all the money is going to is being cut up,
8170520	8174520	like all the profits just being being divided up and given to workers. Right.
8174800	8177640	There's no extra profit to put into expansion of the business.
8178160	8179000	You can take a loan out.
8179000	8182600	OK, well, now the bank that you've loaned the money from,
8182920	8184960	they're going to want interest on their loan.
8184960	8188600	So now you're still going to be extracting some of the profit from the workers.
8188600	8190800	But instead of giving it to an owner, you're giving it to a bank.
8190840	8195560	Well, that bank in their argument would be a locally owned
8195560	8198800	like co-op that is not based
8199400	8202480	owned by either the government or by a private firm.
8202680	8206440	It would be a co-op of people in the community
8206440	8209600	that are looking to invest in a particular item.
8210200	8213080	So interest really, it's still extractive, though.
8213120	8215560	I mean, there's still the interest and it would still be extractive.
8215720	8217320	It doesn't work. It doesn't work.
8217320	8219000	Yeah, no, it's it's really dumb.
8219000	8221920	And like the the market socialists that I've argued with
8223000	8225440	since I've like moved into liberalism,
8226040	8230120	it feels like they're just kind of recreating capitalism,
8230240	8234240	but they don't want to call it capitalism and they don't want there to be like
8234800	8237040	like an individual owning a company.
8237320	8239440	And it's just a yeah. Yeah.
8240880	8245360	So with with Trotsky, his his view was that something like
8246240	8248080	a member of the working class
8248080	8251640	who has managed to work his way up to the point that he owns his own business.
8251640	8254880	He owns a small shop or he owns some kind of some kind of small business
8254880	8257440	that he that he he owns it, but he also works in it.
8257440	8259400	So he's both an owner and a laborer.
8260800	8264560	This person will always side against a socialist revolution
8264560	8268640	and therefore always with the fascists, because all non socialists
8268640	8270960	are fascists in the end, you know how it is. But.
8271960	8276200	But basically, this the small business owner, despite,
8276200	8279560	you know, literally being a worker who owns the means of production,
8279920	8282560	will always side against a socialist revolution
8282560	8286600	because he has built the means of production with his own labor.
8287040	8291360	And so he wants to keep the power structure in place that protects it
8292040	8294560	rather than rather than being part of a revolution
8294560	8296880	that seizes the means of production from someone else.
8297400	8301680	So if you are someone who who creates your own stuff,
8302080	8306000	there's always going to be, in Trotsky's view, an anti socialist streak in you
8306000	8307640	and you're always going to be the enemy.
8307640	8310800	And if you take that point of view to its natural conclusion,
8311040	8315400	that literally means that all socialists have to be like
8316000	8318320	literally the lowest common denominator of person.
8318520	8319680	They can't be creative.
8319680	8321720	They can't be hard working. They can't be innovative.
8322120	8325160	They they just have to be the ones who sees
8325320	8327680	what greater men have built.
8327680	8331960	And it's like, well, I don't know if this is the line of logic
8331960	8334720	you want to go down. It doesn't look very good. Yeah.
8335480	8339200	Yeah. I remember on my way out of there, I
8340040	8342680	he he won't watch anything on YouTube.
8342720	8345280	My one of my old head mods.
8345280	8346840	So F to Internet gas.
8346840	8352200	But he lives in like Romania or some shit, some ex-Soviet state. And
8353200	8355360	it I was like trying so hard.
8355360	8358240	I remember like there was there was
8359480	8361040	I can remember exactly what I was.
8361040	8363960	We were playing fucking Half-Life two and we were watching
8366160	8369360	documentaries about like Soviet style, like
8370600	8373040	economics and like history.
8373200	8375200	And I was like bending over backwards.
8375200	8377840	And like when it was pointed out to me, I was bending over backwards
8377840	8381840	to try and defend what was going on in Soviet Russia.
8381840	8383640	I was like, oh, this is so fucked.
8383640	8385000	Like, why am I doing this?
8385000	8386920	I just I need to learn.
8386920	8388240	And this is like one of the big lessons
8388240	8391640	I've learned since I've started streaming, like learn to just like take an L
8391640	8395760	and like figure out like when you're wrong and just like
8395760	8399400	accept that you were wrong and then like fix your position accordingly.
8399720	8401800	Right. Yeah. It's just.
8402960	8405560	And there is there is an inverse less past that
8406400	8409360	there's an inverse lesson, though, because my audience
8409600	8411320	was way more right leaning than me.
8411320	8413600	And for example, we disagree on whether or not
8414040	8416520	the 2020 election was rigged or not. Right. Right.
8416880	8418880	They they tend to think that it was.
8418880	8420840	I don't think that it was.
8420840	8424960	However, the issue is, is that if we're going just by like
8425400	8429280	popularity and feedback, I should be taking an L from them.
8429280	8430320	But I don't. All right.
8430320	8431800	I don't I don't give them that one.
8431800	8435480	I say, even though there's not be 500 of you in my stream
8435480	8438400	chat saying that I'm wrong, I'll be like, no, I think I'm correct on this one.
8438720	8440560	So sometimes you also have to learn
8440560	8445680	when to go against the popular criticism of you and say, hold on.
8445680	8448520	I don't think that even though it's popular, I don't think it's correct.
8448800	8451320	That's that's like something something that streamers also have to learn, too.
8451640	8454440	Yeah, no, for sure. And that was
8454440	8456560	someone asked how many of my friends have I lost since,
8457080	8458880	like, stop being a socialist.
8458880	8463280	It's like I probably like 90 percent of the people that I used to talk to
8463280	8467960	or were friends with, I'm no longer have contact with
8467960	8472440	because it's either a really bad optically for them to have me on stream
8472440	8475600	and like shitpost around because I've gotten to so many arguments
8475600	8480000	with lefties online and like the the more arguments I get into
8480320	8484160	with these people, like the the meaner I get, because it just
8484400	8487640	I get frustrated and say meaner and meaner things.
8487840	8491600	But like I've probably lost like 90 percent of my professional contacts
8491600	8495360	over the course of like streaming because of like.
8496360	8497880	Just who have you lost?
8497880	8499080	Like what's that?
8499080	8502480	I like I think me and shark three or zero are still cool,
8502480	8505120	but like I don't really like talk to him very much anymore,
8505120	8506520	even though like we used to be on each other's streams,
8506520	8508680	like almost all the fucking time.
8508680	8512280	A lot of people who have like dropped off and like stop streaming.
8513560	8516600	There is this one guy named Growl God.
8516600	8520000	I used to like be in the like Vasht sphere
8520000	8522120	and Vasht had come on my stream a couple of times
8522120	8529120	and like the like all the like smaller orbiters around that,
8529320	8532120	like demon mama and doe and people like that.
8533120	8535040	Who are the fucking insaneoids?
8535040	8538200	Yeah. Who I tried to like be like ultra charitable to,
8538200	8540600	even though like their position was completely untenable.
8541240	8544080	And like the second that you go against them, like it's like
8544080	8546920	you're literally a fascist now and you need to die.
8547920	8551720	So like most of the people like surrounding Vasht
8551720	8554600	are like the people that I had professional contact with
8554600	8559160	and like friendships with and like lost almost all of that,
8559160	8564600	like possible growth from the lefty crowd there, because just
8565960	8568880	either because like I've had a public disagreement with them
8569040	8575080	or because it's just like so like in terms of like Vasht viewers
8575080	8579000	and like people in the space that at least somewhat agree with Vasht.
8579200	8583120	It's like I'm radioactive because I,
8584720	8586320	you know, argued with them too much.
8586320	8589120	And they also tried to say that I was a destiny orbiter
8589120	8592960	before like I actually ever engaged with him, literally ever.
8593240	8595640	So like like that, Vasht does that.
8595760	8598640	He does that. He's like, these are destiny style arguments.
8598680	8600160	Is he feeding you information?
8600160	8603160	Oh, God, that shit is so fucking funny.
8603480	8604760	Oh, God. Yeah.
8604760	8608520	And see, like like Rosarest is like the last person that you could do that to,
8608520	8612880	because he's still like, you know, he I'm pretty sure he is still a socialist.
8612880	8615960	Right. But he's just like a there was a sock to him.
8616840	8618400	Maybe is a sock to him. I don't know.
8618400	8621440	He's made really good arguments for like market socialism
8622440	8625960	that like if I were to get into an argument with him about market socialism,
8626280	8629400	he would probably crush me just because he knows more about the topic
8629400	8631480	of like economics than I do. But.
8633960	8635680	Vasht would be nothing like that. Oh, yeah, of course.
8635680	8639400	But yeah, I remember like I was like simultaneously
8639400	8642920	I was like in this like Venn diagram, like right in the middle
8642920	8645120	between like Vasht and destiny viewers.
8645120	8647880	But like the second that I started like arguing with people on the left
8647880	8650560	for like doing like increasingly fucking crazy things.
8651240	8653040	It was just like it was all over.
8653040	8656160	Like there was no coming back.
8656160	8656960	Like the. Yeah.
8656960	8659040	They also just lean into being an orbiter now.
8659040	8663640	Just oh, yeah, no, I definitely I have I have leaned into that shit so hard.
8664480	8668960	I used to lean into it like way harder back when I was like extra mad
8668960	8672960	at the lefties, like like dog piling me
8673200	8677120	like the the destiny and couples drama like.
8678760	8681160	Oh, my God, couples is a fucking nightmare.
8681200	8683720	Yeah, she is so happy she's gone.
8683960	8686920	I'm so happy she's dropped off hardcore, although she got a W
8686920	8690760	against the poly people person the other day with the Finster drama.
8690760	8696640	But I like the the preamble to that started
8696640	8701520	because I called out demon mama for like calling destiny like
8702880	8705200	or like saying that destiny was hate rating couples.
8705400	8707600	And I was like, wait, is there evidence of that?
8707600	8709520	And she's like, I don't need to give you evidence.
8709520	8712920	So then I like went through and like with the help of like people in my chat
8712920	8716320	and like found like all like the screen caps of like
8716800	8719920	the like when clips were made of when hate rates were happening
8720080	8722360	versus what destiny was doing simultaneously.
8722360	8725200	He was like in a in a debate with someone or like playing
8726280	8728600	not Dark Souls, the other one, the the more recent one.
8729120	8733920	Yeah. And like because I posted that, I got like
8733920	8736880	that was probably like the worst fucking hate I've gotten online.
8736880	8739520	Holy fucking shit.
8739520	8741040	And I wasn't even like home.
8741040	8744280	I was like out of state, like visiting my girlfriend's family.
8744480	8748520	And it was it was just like really fucking that.
8748520	8751320	That's why I like every single
8752600	8755400	thing to do with like destiny and couples or destiny.
8755400	8758600	And demon mama like since then has like my name has come up
8758600	8761680	because the whole like thing started with me
8762480	8767560	like going ultra hard on demon mama because she questioned me.
8768400	8771400	You know, and
8771400	8775440	if you're too radioactive for these people, I definitely am.
8775680	8778760	If if they even know who I am, I'm still like reasonably small, right?
8778760	8779520	I'm not a huge channel.
8779520	8781600	I'm not I'm not I'm not small, but I'm not huge. Right.
8784200	8789840	I know at one point, Zandra Hall was pushing very hard to debate me there,
8789840	8794840	and I eventually I eventually I'm not much of a debater. Right.
8795080	8797440	But I eventually accepted that he vanished.
8797440	8799600	I think he didn't want to actually do it.
8799600	8802720	And also, I managed to get like Sargon to debate.
8802720	8803440	I was like Sargon.
8803480	8804960	Hey, then I'll say some things about you.
8804960	8805760	Do you want to debate?
8805760	8807200	Do you want to debate?
8807200	8810080	And so I was like, I'm such an Adam, right?
8811240	8813440	No, Chud Logic was going to host it. Oh, shit.
8813480	8818000	So Chud Logic was going to was going to moderate between Zandra Hall and Sargon.
8818440	8820480	And Chud was down and Chud was trying to set it up.
8820800	8824160	And at the same time, Zandra Hall wanted to debate me.
8824160	8825440	And I was like, OK, fine.
8825440	8828160	And then he just ghosted all of us.
8828160	8830400	He just vanished.
8830400	8832840	And now he acts like it never fucking happened.
8833440	8836040	Yeah. The only time I ever interacted with Zandra Hall, he
8837320	8841080	I was talking with Zandra Hall, Shark Three of Zero and Merrick.
8841280	8844760	And Zandra Hall just like told a story about him, like coming in his own shorts
8844760	8849040	all the time as a teenager because he didn't want to like get caught masturbating.
8849040	8851440	And he just like wallowed in the cum.
8851680	8853920	And so like, that's the only interaction I've ever had with him.
8853920	8857160	So was that on stream or? Yes, it was on stream.
8857320	8861920	It was hellish, actually, like him telling the story because it was it was so
8862000	8865560	there was so much detail about how the kind of just laid on his leg.
8865560	8867640	And it was like it went on for way too long.
8867640	8872800	And I was like, you don't want to be telling the story. OK, but yeah.
8873280	8877600	Merrick is somebody else that I've been like kind of friendly with over the years,
8877600	8879440	but not really, not anymore.
8879440	8880560	That's kind of kind of ended.
8880560	8883080	I think that's what happened with me, because I like
8884640	8888160	there was like, you know, the better discourse debates that Destiny's gone on.
8888200	8891680	He like argued with the Nico House guy.
8891960	8895480	About like Google owning everything.
8895480	8897360	I don't think I know this one. No, no.
8897360	8899000	It's like an event that happens in Dallas.
8899000	8902560	And I had gone to that in me, a shark, zero shark
8903960	8907560	socialism done left in Merrick, all roomed in an Airbnb together.
8907720	8910400	So I really like and I really like Merrick. Right.
8911000	8913840	And there were like really, really great people in person.
8914040	8918600	But like the online like discourse with these people are not still
8918600	8920960	SEO is like really, really chill.
8920960	8927520	But Merrick is online is way different than Merrick IRL.
8928360	8931600	Both of their policy prescriptions seem to be fucking insane.
8932000	8935320	Like nothing about how cool they are as people, but like their ideas.
8935320	8936960	Yeah, that's for both of them.
8936960	8939800	Like they're just holy fuck.
8940360	8945720	With Merrick, the last time I talked to her, I was basically I was steel
8945720	8951200	manning Destiny's position of replatforming Nick Fuentes, saying, listen.
8952520	8955800	Regardless, the point that Destiny seemed to be making was that,
8955800	8959440	one, it had been a long time, he didn't know if Nick Fuentes was was so extreme.
8959680	8961360	He was like 18 back in the day.
8961360	8963440	Now he's like 24 people's opinions change.
8963440	8964760	That's a long time.
8964760	8968640	And in a in a especially transformative period of your life,
8968840	8970760	maybe he's not as extreme as he used to be.
8970760	8973080	And two, I think this was the better argument.
8974080	8978720	Is that. It doesn't matter if Nick Fuentes is a fascist
8978720	8981440	or some other kind of, you know, insane ideology,
8981760	8983920	because the conversations are more interesting.
8983960	8987960	Nobody is talking about this stuff, so let's talk about the actual ideas
8987960	8990920	and forget about like, OK, you're a fascist, therefore you're evil, you know?
8991440	8994840	And I think those are actually two pretty good, pretty good reasons
8994840	8997840	as to why Destiny should have kept talking to Nick Fuentes
8997840	8999960	or at least should have started talking to him again.
9000200	9001400	Like that's fine.
9001440	9002360	I don't think like.
9002360	9005880	But she was going, no, Nick Fuentes is way too smart for Destiny.
9005960	9007840	He's way too smart for you.
9007840	9011440	He's going to fucking he's going to like convert everyone's audience
9011440	9013000	and you're all too stupid to know it.
9013000	9014640	And I was like, Merrick.
9014920	9017600	Is he is he too smart for you?
9018080	9021440	And she was like, no, no, I'm the only one who could outthink him.
9021600	9022720	And I'm like, why don't you talk to him?
9022720	9025760	Then, you know, and she like she just took off after that.
9025760	9027400	She wouldn't she wouldn't reply to that, right?
9027400	9029840	Yeah, I feel like.
9030520	9034400	There were there were some like critiques, like I felt like the like getting
9034680	9038040	getting dinner and like streaming that with Fuentes was like weird.
9038040	9039760	But like, I don't think I can tell.
9039760	9042960	Yeah, I don't feel like I can tell people who they can and can't
9043000	9045920	like do content with, so like I never really.
9049040	9050560	You know, I never really like went hard
9050560	9053000	into like saying Destiny should or shouldn't be
9054320	9056920	talking to him, you know,
9056920	9060240	but I, I have a good answer for that.
9060240	9062280	I have a really good answer for that.
9062280	9067560	I don't view it as my obligation to actually make the world better.
9068480	9071720	It'd be good if I did, but I'm not required to.
9071720	9074640	If I want to chill and hang out with someone who,
9074920	9078560	you know, even though he has really strange radical politics
9078800	9080960	in a nonpolitical way, he's a nice guy.
9080960	9082200	If I want to do that, I can do that.
9082200	9083800	You know, I can fucking do that.
9083800	9086680	I am under no obligation to platform anyone
9086840	9090880	or not platform anyone based on anybody else's moral intuitions.
9090880	9093040	I don't care about any of that shit.
9093040	9095400	The whole shouldn't you use your platform to be more?
9095520	9098200	No, I shouldn't. No, absolutely not.
9098560	9099720	I completely reject that logic.
9101520	9104280	Yeah, I don't like necessarily disagree.
9104280	9107400	Vash would call that super augatory.
9107400	9109640	But the God
9109640	9112040	I feel like when it comes to Fuentes,
9112040	9115400	I lost so much respect for him, like intellectually.
9115400	9118000	Like he used to be like a really scary person
9119240	9122080	just like because it was like ideology and shit, because like it's
9122680	9125320	like I do find like the
9125320	9129320	this might be a brave take, but I find like the Nazi stuff to be really disgusting.
9130160	9132280	But like a good job.
9132280	9136920	Yeah, good job with all the Kino casino fucking like cat boy
9136920	9140840	come hunting shit that he did with the America first people.
9141040	9143240	He's just like a fucking goon.
9143240	9145520	I'm not really I don't really see him as like a
9146480	9148920	super like spooky person as much anymore, you know?
9150480	9152720	Yeah, yeah, I completely agree with you.
9152760	9154560	I completely agree with you.
9155720	9158000	And if we're talking about like actual,
9158320	9161480	you know, influential right wing figures,
9161480	9163960	I mean, Nick Fuentes is very influential, especially in the United States. Right.
9164480	9167800	But he's he's running a political movement
9167800	9171000	that will probably fizzle out as he as he gets older. Right.
9171360	9175080	It's already gone through several iterations over the course of his online career.
9176560	9181520	You know, the epochs of people's life tend to not last more than a decade.
9181920	9184200	He'll probably be doing something different in 10 years. Right.
9184520	9187120	We all probably will be.
9188200	9192800	I'd be super curious to see what like a 30 year old Nick Fuentes is doing,
9192800	9195720	like given how fucking radioactive he is. But
9196720	9197920	I know I know what you mean.
9197920	9201960	Maybe he might he might like morph into an Alex Jones Rush
9201960	9204000	Limbaugh kind of a person where he does like radio instead.
9204560	9205520	He kind of does that now.
9205520	9208240	But he also does like real life activism, you know, but he might like
9208240	9210640	he might try to try to try to parlay that into some sort of a show,
9211200	9213360	like a grander scale show.
9213360	9216960	I do think his numbers are probably kind of inflated over on cozy. Oh, 100%.
9218680	9222320	But but no, like, have you have you heard about the act
9222320	9224920	like the whole academic agent present Sunday thing?
9226600	9228760	I don't know. Oh, wait.
9229480	9231600	I vaguely know about this.
9231800	9235360	He present Sunday before he like got big into like streaming.
9235360	9239400	He like doxed in, contacted academic agents
9239880	9242400	workplace, right, and got him fired. Yes.
9242880	9248600	He was a university professor in the UK and he got him fired. Jesus.
9249400	9254320	Yeah. And now here's here's what he got him fired for.
9254880	9258920	Academic agent was like your generic anti SJW YouTuber. Yeah. All right.
9259440	9261560	And the UK is pretty extreme when it comes to stuff
9261560	9264360	like this compared to compared to North America.
9264720	9269520	So he lost his job for daring to make fun of the SJWs in 2014.
9270760	9274920	And he this guy, he's like a university professor and he's he's pretty well
9274920	9276480	educated, he's pretty well read.
9276480	9278040	He's he's very sharp.
9278040	9281800	You don't want to debate him, even though I don't think he's correct generally.
9282160	9286440	But I do respect him and I do like I have his his his latest book.
9286920	9291480	That's something I'll probably be tackling soon, maybe depending on my time. But.
9293240	9296520	Even though I don't agree with him, I respect him because he's somebody
9296520	9299480	who is well read and he's well educated and he can he can write.
9299480	9301680	He can think he can speak.
9301680	9305240	And so this guy who is probably like a very generic conservative
9305560	9309960	or he was back in the day now, he's he after after losing his job
9309960	9312600	and having to like scrabble together enough money to survive
9312960	9315600	and, you know, being being treated by the system
9315600	9317800	that he views as being a left leaning system.
9317800	9322400	He's he's like a full, hardcore neo reactionary. Right. Right.
9322400	9325600	And now he's writing now he's writing political theory for the neo
9325600	9329720	reactionary camp, you know, and it's like Jesus. All right.
9330360	9334120	I don't know what you necessarily accomplished by getting this guy canceled
9334120	9336160	other than radicalizing him.
9336160	9338680	And he's also capable of of of writing,
9339080	9341840	you know, scathing political theory for your enemies.
9341840	9344720	So you've you've made things worse President Sunday.
9344760	9348120	I feel like it's the obvious like conclusion.
9348120	9351640	If you're going to like drive people out of like the like general
9351640	9354640	like spaces where everybody talks,
9354640	9357080	then you're going to push them into like spaces
9357080	9361760	where only like certain opinions are are accepted. Right.
9361920	9365280	And even if that person is like relatively like center,
9365560	9369400	like, you know, center leaning towards their politics,
9369400	9371520	maybe they're a little bit rightly, maybe they're a little bit leftly,
9371520	9373680	but they're relatively centrist. Right.
9373680	9377320	If you if you push it to where they only ever get to interact with people
9377320	9380280	that are like super far left or super far right, then
9381200	9383880	where do you think their positions are going to end up? You know?
9385320	9387480	Yeah, it's and it's not just that.
9387480	9393080	It's also I think academic agent really took like he got down.
9393400	9397040	Like you got like trampled by the system after he got fired
9397400	9400360	and he viewed it as a left leaning system, and that was a lot of it, too.
9400640	9402880	It's like so there's there's this theory on the right.
9403280	9405400	And I think it holds some some weight.
9405400	9408720	And it's this it's basically they call it
9410080	9412520	the best way to describe it is tyranny by red tape.
9413440	9416920	So the idea is that government can become so big
9416920	9419520	and so bloated and so bureaucratic
9420120	9424720	that you never even know when you're doing something wrong.
9424720	9428120	You know, the the common stereotype is if you walk down to the store,
9428120	9430200	you can violate a dozen laws and not even know it.
9430200	9432320	You know, you hear that story a lot. Yeah, for sure. And.
9433320	9438360	And the idea basically is a government that is that expansive can therefore
9438680	9443400	choose when to enforce a law and when not to enforce a law.
9443760	9446360	So you never know if you're if you're in trouble.
9446640	9448560	You never know if you're not in trouble.
9448560	9452720	And it might just be the whims of the people involved that you are in trouble,
9452720	9455280	you know, because maybe you could jaywalk and then get hit with a fine
9455280	9457480	and then the next day do it and then knock it up to get it with a fine,
9457680	9462760	depending on who's around what if the officer there likes you, if he doesn't.
9462960	9467360	So the way that society is currently structured, according to this view,
9467360	9472160	that's pretty common on the right right now, is that it's so it's so expansive
9472360	9476840	and also there's not enough resources to implement all of it at all times.
9477080	9479760	So it becomes necessarily arbitrary.
9480080	9487080	So it's it's it's something like a narco tyranny, if that makes sense. Yeah. Yeah.
9487160	9490040	And yeah, it is kind of related to to Franz Kafka's
9490640	9494960	Kafka, Kafka esque work, you know, the idea that you have these big
9494960	9498440	impersonal bureaucracies that just kind of crush you and there's nothing
9498440	9501440	you can do about it because there's no actual person to talk to, you know,
9501600	9505240	that like you hear this a lot when you complain, if you call up a business
9505240	9508040	and you only get like a phone message and there's no actual real person
9508040	9510680	to discuss or things like get a person.
9510680	9512200	They say, well, this isn't my department.
9512200	9513320	Talk to this person.
9513320	9516040	They say this is my department. They sit you off somewhere else.
9516600	9518400	Or this is my this is just store policy.
9518400	9519360	We can't do anything about it.
9519360	9522680	Like when you've hit a stone wall where it seems like
9522680	9525600	there's no actual way that being reasonable can help you.
9525920	9528320	You know, this this this is the tyranny of red tape.
9530160	9534480	And right wing people who talk about this, they pin a lot of it on the left
9534640	9536120	because someone in the chat mentions H.R.
9536120	9537120	departments, H.R.
9537120	9540160	departments are overwhelmingly run by left leaning people.
9540400	9542640	You know, a lot a lot of these standards are
9543120	9545840	overwhelmingly implemented by left leaning people in government.
9546160	9549520	So the right views the tyranny of red tape
9549520	9552480	as being a natural byproduct of leftist policy.
9553360	9556760	Yeah, I've heard a lot of like right wing critiques of the right wing
9556760	9560520	saying that they they kind of ceded so much cultural ground
9560520	9563640	to the to the left in so many different areas, whether it's
9564240	9566800	bureaucracy or whether it's,
9566800	9569360	you know, like everyone went into like financial systems
9569360	9573000	or into oil or some shit like that on the right that they built out
9573000	9574360	all these things there.
9574360	9578560	But like when it came to like Hollywood or when it came to like online stuff
9578560	9580520	or when it came to,
9580520	9582120	like you're saying, like H.R.
9582120	9586760	like psychology or basically anything there, philosophy, academia,
9587920	9591640	because they didn't like build out anybody like going into these areas
9591640	9593160	because they weren't seen as important.
9593160	9596600	Now it's all dominated by the left and it's really hard to get a foothold
9596600	9600520	because there's so much like a social pressure and like
9601040	9608040	inter like profession pressure to be within that head space
9608040	9612760	or like political space that like people that are right wing in those areas
9612760	9615760	end up like burning out or like just,
9616680	9618720	you know, not going into it at all, you know?
9619680	9623040	Yeah. And there's actually also an inverse effect, too.
9623480	9626680	And here's a great way so I can describe it. So.
9629480	9632040	If you want to become, hold on,
9632480	9635800	maybe I can find the video so I can show you exactly what I mean, OK?
9637680	9638880	Give me just a second.
9638880	9641680	After this video, I'm probably going to have to log off, by the way.
9641880	9642840	I've been streaming for all my time.
9642840	9645520	I mean, it's it's it is it is 10 p.m. for me.
9645520	9648320	I'll have to go in a few minutes, too.
9649800	9652120	OK, so I'll give you a video,
9652120	9655120	I'll give you the explanation of the theory, and then we can we can call it.
9655520	9657800	All right. It's a minute long. So just check this out. All right.
9662040	9664280	OK, so check out what this guy is doing, right?
9664280	9666360	I think this is the correct. Yes, it is. This is the correct video.
9666800	9671960	So this is a guy who's been a professional drywaller for 30 years,
9671960	9676280	and he's specialized exclusively in how to put up drywall
9676600	9679040	and like look at how he does his work right.
9679280	9680760	He doesn't need to measure.
9680760	9682640	He just he knows exactly where to cut.
9682640	9684240	You know exactly how to cut.
9684240	9686440	You can put in nails in one hammer.
9686640	9688640	You can slice these sheets, no problem.
9688640	9691840	Like this is this is like an unparalleled level of skill.
9691960	9694160	Yeah. Right. To do the to do the job like this.
9695640	9697960	And the thing is,
9697960	9703120	is that you can't learn this type of skill by reading a book on drywall.
9703640	9706320	It doesn't matter how many books on drywall that you read,
9706320	9708400	you'll never become as skilled solely by reading books.
9708640	9711280	Reading can help, but you have to do it
9712120	9714320	to become this good at something, right?
9714320	9717520	So there's a conservative political philosopher.
9717880	9720760	There's I think it's Michael Oakshot.
9720760	9723600	I think that's his name, Michael Oakshot.
9725120	9727800	Yes, Michael Oakshot, and he had a theory
9728360	9735000	and his theory is that knowledge can be split into two different things.
9735560	9738080	So you have intellectual knowledge,
9738080	9742320	which is the rational knowledge, reasonable knowledge, minded knowledge.
9742640	9744160	This is the stuff that you can write down.
9744160	9745760	This is theory. All right.
9745760	9748480	And then you have embodied knowledge.
9749040	9753160	And that is what you learn by actively practicing and doing a thing.
9753480	9757040	And you can't express embodied knowledge through theory.
9758080	9761160	So this is and this is something that, in his opinion,
9761360	9764080	the left has completely abandoned.
9765080	9768320	Is the practice of these sorts of things and getting knowledge
9768320	9771880	through doing rather than through academic means.
9771880	9776160	Yeah. And so, you know, you have a lot of leftists who who think that studying
9776160	9780920	should be very academic and and a lot of writing, a lot of theorizing,
9780920	9784520	a lot of thinking and almost no actual practice. That's that's why.
9784640	9787120	And in fact, you can see this in some of the conversations they have.
9787360	9790240	They'll say, well, that didn't that, you know, that wasn't real socialism.
9790240	9792120	Well, why not? Well, this is what Marx actually wrote.
9792120	9793080	It's like, well, hold on.
9793080	9796120	You can't rely on the theory if the practice is different, right?
9796120	9799000	They completely abandon the practice part of the thing.
9799360	9802480	Yes. So in the chat says you can't get better motor skills by reading theory.
9802480	9804920	Exactly. It's still a form of knowledge.
9804920	9807320	It's still stored in your brain like knowledges,
9807800	9811520	but it can't be accessed through rationalistic means.
9811760	9814600	It's more intuition than reason.
9814600	9817800	And fuck, I wish I saved the clip.
9817800	9818720	There was a clip there.
9818720	9822080	I tuned into one of his streams at one point, and he said something like,
9822440	9827480	Intuitional thinking is is the the foundation of fascist thinking.
9827680	9831400	And if you and if you ever go off your intuition, ever, you're a fascist
9831400	9833440	or like or you're leading into fascist territory.
9833440	9835640	And it's like, holy fuck, dude.
9835640	9838640	That plays into the fascist talking point that like, like,
9839240	9841400	fuck, it's been so long since I've like
9842520	9845880	read Genteelay, but
9845880	9849600	they they really hate people that like learn for the sake of learning.
9849600	9852080	They want they want men of action to like go out there.
9852080	9855680	Like, of course, there's going to be some it's like anti-intellectualism,
9855680	9859400	but like in a very specific way where they talk about like, oh, well,
9859960	9864120	of course, like we need people who are like good at like trigonometry and stuff
9864120	9867360	so that so that like we can figure out how to fire shells.
9867560	9871840	But like if you never like apply that knowledge, then you're just like learning
9871840	9872760	for the sake of learning.
9872760	9877040	And this leads to like, you know, weak men and weak societies.
9877040	9878800	Right. You have to do stuff. Right.
9879600	9882200	Yeah. Which would be embodied if you like look at the 14 points
9882200	9884600	like the the cult of action for action's sake.
9884840	9888200	But like it goes like so much deeper than the four, 14 points
9888960	9892680	because they they don't mean like don't learn anything.
9892680	9894680	Lol. Don't learn how to do math.
9894680	9897400	They mean like if you do math right.
9897520	9901000	Learn how to use that knowledge for the state in some way.
9901200	9902880	You know, so. Yeah.
9902880	9905800	And the worst part about that is that is that people on the left
9905800	9909680	tend to take that position that the fascists held and say,
9910160	9913520	therefore, that means the fascists were always irrational all the time.
9914040	9916120	It's like, well, no, that's not how that works.
9916120	9919320	But you're you're not you're not listening to what they're saying.
9919320	9922720	You see, you hear people say fascism is a fundamentally irrational position.
9922720	9923920	It's like, well, no, not really.
9923920	9927200	You know, they they have they had
9928360	9932600	they were at war against reason for solely for reason's sake.
9932840	9935040	That's true. But doesn't make them irrational.
9935040	9939960	You know, and I do think that there's obviously I'm definitely a golden mean
9940200	9943520	type of person when it comes to a lot of the things that I try to say and do.
9943800	9947160	I think that there's obviously a middle ground between theorizing and acting.
9947160	9949280	Right. Like you need both of it. You need both of it.
9949640	9952800	If you if you live in a in a in a realm of pure theory,
9952800	9955800	then you do end up being one of those left leaning elites
9955800	9958440	that the right leaning people think exist. You know,
9960040	9964120	I don't I don't like a lot of a lot of right wing solutions
9964160	9965200	to problems.
9965200	9967280	There are some good ones, but I generally don't like them.
9967280	9971360	But they have some very good critiques of of liberalism
9971360	9974920	and of socialism that I think they get ignored way too much.
9975160	9977120	You know, people don't read Oakshot.
9977120	9980440	People don't read, you know, these conservative political theorists.
9981120	9985920	They just listen to like whatever Matt Gates is spouting or something, you know?
9986120	9987960	Yeah, exactly.
9988640	9990720	All righty. Well, I'm going to in stream here.
9990960	9994000	I'll talk to chat for like probably a minute or so.
9994160	9997000	But yeah, that was that was that was a lot of fun.
9997000	9998640	I think I was here for like an hour or two.
9998640	10000800	Yeah. Something about something along those lines.
10001200	10003360	Really fun conversation.
10003360	10006320	I I think we watched your video on fascism
10006800	10009280	on stream a couple of months ago when I was still on Twitch.
10009280	10012240	But I'm probably going to revisit that again,
10012240	10015440	because it's probably one of the better videos on fascism scene.
10015440	10017600	So I'm making a second one.
10017840	10019440	Oh, fucking beast.
10019440	10023560	I'm doing I'm currently working on another video and it's called
10024640	10027480	Is fascism actually capitalism in decay?
10027960	10029720	Oh, that's that's stupid.
10029720	10032280	Yeah, I can't wait for that one.
10032280	10034520	But the answer to that is like 90 percent.
10034520	10036680	No, it's not. Yeah, it is not.
10037960	10039560	Well, hey, man, it's been a fun conversation.
10039560	10041160	I'll catch you later, right?
10041160	10042960	Yep. I'll see you later. All right. Bye.
