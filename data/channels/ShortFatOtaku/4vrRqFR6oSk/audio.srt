1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,840
I have to run downstairs for just a second.

2
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:02,800
Sure, okay, go ahead.

3
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,600
If you want to respond to chat,

4
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:05,440
you're more than welcome to,

5
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,200
just don't say anything to us, all right?

6
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,320
Sure, okay, sure.

7
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,400
Well, the fact that Sanzil is 28 years old

8
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,020
and supports a senile child sniffer, Joe Biden,

9
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:17,520
who is obviously not any sort of strong young man

10
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,140
to guide the country in a right direction

11
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:20,600
is absolutely sad, pathetic,

12
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,440
and borderline criminal on his end.

13
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,920
Sanzil should be embarrassed.

14
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:24,800
He should be,

15
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,600
Biden doesn't want to do the right thing.

16
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,760
Biden is just,

17
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,480
doesn't care about the people of this country.

18
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,540
He cares more about people from other places.

19
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:33,640
That's very clear.

20
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:37,120
He's allowing for many people all across this country

21
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,480
to suffer in the broken systems and so forth.

22
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,080
And he's allays policies, especially regarding the border,

23
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,060
and he's trying to take people's guns,

24
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:51,060
and he's trying to get you to take the very suspect vaccine,

25
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,600
as well as many other things.

26
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:57,160
And so, Joe Biden is not to be trusted in the slightest.

27
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,640
He's just a criminal Democrat

28
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,360
that doesn't give a fuck about the people

29
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,400
and allows them to be fed slop for all time.

30
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,840
He won from fraud.

31
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,000
There's no way in hell he got 80 million votes.

32
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,240
He has no rallies.

33
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,880
He has nobody show up, nobody support him.

34
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,600
And basically people just voted for him,

35
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,280
not because they want what's right,

36
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,260
not because they want an actual country,

37
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,040
just because they want free stuff.

38
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,240
So that's the situation in America today.

39
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,560
It's, and Sanzil doesn't,

40
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,120
Sanzil would rather support these criminals

41
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,600
than actually do what's right

42
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,320
and understand that this whole motherfucking system,

43
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,840
this whole motherfucking country to some degree

44
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,240
needs to be re-evaluated, re-looked at and so forth.

45
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,000
Sanzil doesn't understand that we're just degrading

46
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,260
as time goes by.

47
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,320
Hello, sir, hi.

48
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,320
Hi.

49
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,920
So you sound like a lefty, dude.

50
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,960
Maybe, I mean, I can tell you

51
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,520
I'm just against the American government wholeheartedly.

52
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,440
Yeah, you sound like a revolutionary socialist

53
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,760
who, you know, wants to overthrow the government

54
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:01,960
and did you a lot of social spending to-

55
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,400
You happy with how America is today?

56
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,760
Okay, I'm back.

57
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,600
I'm not an American.

58
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,600
I don't care how America is today.

59
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,040
I don't give a fuck.

60
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:12,480
Okay, well, where are you?

61
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,280
I'm in Canada.

62
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,960
Okay, well, that's the state

63
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,960
maybe someone could argue even worse.

64
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,880
What, do you work for the government or something?

65
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,800
You and Sanzil, two best buddies,

66
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,360
one works for the Canadian government,

67
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,240
one works for the American government,

68
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,680
both corrupt, both evil,

69
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,520
both don't believe in the right thing.

70
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,280
Does Sanzil work for the American government?

71
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,840
In the loosest terms possible.

72
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,440
I'm like in education.

73
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,200
Sanzil looks connected to FBI agents.

74
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,520
He's convinced that I'm a CIA agent, but-

75
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,360
Oh, please.

76
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,280
Okay, well, what do you actually do?

77
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,200
I'm going to education.

78
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,600
So right now I'm working like it's a substitute teacher

79
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,800
and getting experience there.

80
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,840
Oh, okay, fair enough.

81
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,080
Didn't you get a degree for political science, bud?

82
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:58,120
I'm in school for political science, yeah.

83
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,560
Oh, okay, okay.

84
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,200
You're best friends with Destiny,

85
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,120
who's like a confirmed anti-extremist online federal agent

86
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,240
or something like that, right?

87
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,440
Well, I'm also anti-extremist, right?

88
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,840
But I just like engaging with them

89
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,440
because they're funny online.

90
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,800
You don't think this justifies a little bit of a-

91
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,120
I think that the only reason that these are extreme times

92
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,480
are because people like you buy into literally

93
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:22,720
every single fucking conspiracy that's ever been written

94
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,760
on the face of the planet and you warp them all into one

95
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,000
giant amalgamated fucking horrible conspiracy

96
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,880
where somehow 9-11 is tied in with flat earth,

97
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,000
is tied in with the JFK assassination,

98
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
is tied in with fucking Wuhan fucking China lab leaks

99
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,560
and shit.

100
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,440
Yeah, I think it's your group

101
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,440
that is making the world more extreme.

102
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:51,440
And then we see extremism in the early 2000s

103
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,040
after 9-11 from the right.

104
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,680
And then there was a massive backlash from the left on that.

105
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,560
It made a whole bunch of extremist lefties

106
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:03,000
because you'd expect extremists on one side

107
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,600
to breed extremists on the other side.

108
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,720
And then, oh, okay, bye.

109
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,560
Oh, okay, there you go.

110
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,680
It's not, yeah, no, my mic had just an issue.

111
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,040
It's not, no, it's not us.

112
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,160
I disagree wholeheartedly.

113
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,800
That's us making the extreme.

114
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,440
The extremists are generated

115
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,480
vis-a-vis failures of the American government.

116
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,280
The extremists are produced by-

117
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,400
But you always talk about the failures of the government,

118
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,280
but you never tell me like specifics

119
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,640
about what the government is failing us with.

120
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,520
Well, we just laid it out, man.

121
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,360
What about-

122
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,200
Hold on, I just got here

123
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,080
and I have a few questions for you.

124
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,440
Yeah, I'll let you guys talk for a second.

125
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,520
What do you want me to call you?

126
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,000
Will you work for the Canadian government

127
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,240
or what's the deal?

128
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,840
He's a YouTuber, dog.

129
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,520
I'm a YouTuber.

130
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,080
I work for myself.

131
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,080
That doesn't tell me anything.

132
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:44,920
Yeah, okay.

133
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:48,080
Okay, well, here, I'll tell you what.

134
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,880
Give him a little bit of a,

135
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,440
give him a little bit of a cut.

136
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,400
I don't support Trudeau, no, no.

137
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,160
I'm equal parts liberal and conservative.

138
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,400
I've voted for the liberals before.

139
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,480
I'm probably gonna vote conservative

140
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,720
in the next Canadian election.

141
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,400
I am definitely unaligned politically.

142
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,160
Okay, sure.

143
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,600
What do you think about Trudeau with his black face,

144
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,440
with all of his various,

145
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,840
have you seen all the costumes,

146
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,080
outfits, these pictures of him in?

147
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,080
Yeah, it's fucking hilarious.

148
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,080
Oh yeah, the black face one's really funny.

149
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,920
When he looks like Hitler in that other one,

150
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,200
that one's hilarious too, man.

151
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,760
That's a real joke.

152
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,560
I think that, I think he was doing some,

153
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,720
I think he was doing de Gaulle actually, but yeah.

154
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,480
Yeah, Trudeau's a fucking joke.

155
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,720
He's made Canada into a fucking joke.

156
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,160
I'm not a fan of Trudeau.

157
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,680
To be fair, I voted for him in 2015,

158
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,520
but if you listen to Trudeau's speeches in like 2013,

159
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,920
he was a significantly different person back then

160
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,120
than he is now.

161
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,320
I wouldn't vote for him again.

162
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,600
Look at what the poor truckers in Canada.

163
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,360
Imagine you're a trucker in Canada.

164
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,280
That's gotta be the worst experience ever.

165
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,720
Oh man, poor Canada truckers.

166
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,960
I actually want to talk to you about that a bit, okay?

167
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,320
So I don't want to put words in your mouth,

168
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:59,160
but I kind of have a feeling of what your position is

169
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,280
on this just by listening to you.

170
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,640
So I want you to confirm this, all right?

171
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,480
Were you one of the guys who, let's say a year ago,

172
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:09,440
maybe two years ago, you were saying that

173
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,080
the COVID lockdowns were going to be used by the government

174
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,960
as a way to seize power and take away liberty

175
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,680
from the people and that this was going to turn into

176
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,360
some kind of everlasting situation?

177
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,120
Well, it may not have turned,

178
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,920
I agree that that still could happen.

179
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,720
It's always possible that it could happen, yeah, but-

180
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,640
Yeah, I agree with all that, yeah.

181
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,600
Okay, yeah.

182
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,120
So the thing is, is that you're correct

183
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,760
in that there is a danger of that happening.

184
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:39,840
And there were some, let's say pretty bad politicians

185
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,920
who actually wanted to do that.

186
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,640
Maybe not in the States, but in Canada

187
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,640
and in the UK, definitely.

188
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,040
There were some politicians who said,

189
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,320
you know, this is the new normal.

190
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,600
We're going to have lockdowns and masks forever.

191
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,840
And you're going to have that VAX pass on your phone

192
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,040
for the rest of time.

193
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,280
And your liberties are gone and you're fucked

194
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,880
because it's going to be all in the name of safety.

195
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,240
And fair enough, there were some people out there

196
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,080
who seemed pretty evil, who were pushing for that stuff.

197
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:07,400
But here's the white pill, they all lost, all right?

198
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,640
Because the VAX pass is gone in Canada.

199
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,040
It's gone in the UK.

200
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,800
I think it's gone in the States.

201
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,400
None of these policies have actually come to fruition.

202
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,800
It's not gone in the States.

203
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,120
Really, so are you scanning a VAX pass

204
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,600
every time you have to go into a restaurant

205
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,760
like you did a few years ago?

206
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,720
Not me, but not me personally.

207
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,320
And I never, I got the VAX,

208
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,480
so I never have scanned any pass ever.

209
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,440
But not me personally, but I know people

210
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:34,360
that still are having to present their VAX, yeah.

211
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,200
100% that's still happening.

212
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,640
Like password, whatever.

213
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:40,760
In California that happens, I know for certain.

214
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,760
But it probably happens in other places in America too, yeah.

215
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,120
Now, to be fair, I don't know many Californians.

216
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,000
I do know one who says that the VAX pass,

217
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
she told me the VAX pass is gone in California.

218
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,680
So it's, well, it seems like

219
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,160
that all of these measures were temporary.

220
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,880
And though they could have been used to,

221
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,600
let's say, expand a government tyranny,

222
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,160
and there were some people who might have

223
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:08,800
even wanted to do it, they lost, all right?

224
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,420
And democracy actually won because those policies

225
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:13,340
were so unpopular they vanished.

226
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:18,760
Okay, but I agree that there's nothing really

227
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,600
that they could do.

228
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,560
I don't think it necessarily is about popularity

229
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,400
or unpopularity or anything of that nature.

230
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,240
I think-

231
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,060
Why do you say that?

232
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:28,640
I think to some degree, people just got tired of COVID

233
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:31,440
and they got, they refused to be locked down anymore.

234
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,240
Well, is that not popularity though?

235
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,000
The policies of keeping people locked down

236
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,840
became unpopular and so they vanished.

237
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,820
That's how it would work in a democracy, you know?

238
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,700
When the policies are popular, they happen.

239
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,660
And when they're not popular, they stop.

240
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:48,840
Yeah, but I don't, it's not about like,

241
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:52,180
I don't think COVID happened because it was popular

242
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:54,620
to shut everything down necessarily.

243
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:56,140
And that's why, you're saying that's like

244
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:59,860
kind of a warped view of like popular policy

245
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:02,000
will always prevail or something of that nature.

246
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,420
And that's just not the case.

247
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:06,340
Well, not always, but it often prevails, yes.

248
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:11,140
Okay, often is, I mean, it depends on the situation

249
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:12,860
I'd say, but-

250
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:16,060
Okay, so I don't know what your, hold on, hold on.

251
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,380
I have to ask you a question here.

252
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:20,180
It's gonna sound slightly insulting,

253
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:21,460
but I'm not meaning to be insulting.

254
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,580
I just wanna get to the heart of the matter, okay?

255
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,020
What's your education level

256
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:26,620
when it comes to this sort of thing?

257
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,660
Education level?

258
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:32,880
Yeah, how much do you know formally about politics?

259
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:36,500
Canadian politics, I don't know too much about,

260
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,300
but I can tell what they did with the trucker

261
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,060
shutting everything down was not good.

262
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,860
Like forcing them to get the vaccine

263
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:44,580
when there's the massive protests.

264
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:47,340
It's so, because they have to get the jab,

265
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:48,660
they don't even trust the government.

266
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,140
So why would the government,

267
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:51,780
how can they ask them to get that?

268
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:53,420
How can they require that?

269
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:55,260
I don't necessarily disagree with you on that because-

270
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,500
The threat of you can't feed your family.

271
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,740
I don't necessarily disagree with you,

272
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:01,220
but what I'm getting at though is,

273
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:03,100
are you an elite theory guy?

274
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,980
Is that like your framework that you're viewing

275
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:07,900
all these government actions through is through elite theory?

276
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,820
No, I don't, no, no, no, no.

277
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:12,380
It's just obvious the whole system's corrupt, man.

278
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:14,580
Biden's 400 years old sniffing kids.

279
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,980
Is that a leader you should have?

280
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:18,580
Is that what's right for the country?

281
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:21,500
Like it's just obvious that everything's broken.

282
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,900
Everybody's 400 pounds, yeah, through fraud, bud.

283
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:26,820
Everything's broken, everybody's 400 pounds.

284
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,520
The government's jack full of corrupt people

285
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,300
that don't care about what's right.

286
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,740
The systems are all broken.

287
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,380
They're not producing good people.

288
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:35,780
Their operation is horrible.

289
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:36,820
They don't know what they're doing.

290
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,180
They're not running correctly.

291
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,260
They're not running well.

292
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:42,460
I can't respond to everything, but-

293
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:44,380
Yeah, let him talk a little bit, all right?

294
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:45,500
I can't respond to all those points,

295
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,820
but there is one that I want to talk about

296
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,220
because you've mentioned a lot

297
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:51,140
about how you don't believe democracy is working, right?

298
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:54,680
100%, yes, absolutely.

299
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,140
So is this a case-

300
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:57,740
Look at where we are in America today

301
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,140
with so-called democracy.

302
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,820
Yeah, it's real beauty.

303
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:04,500
So is this a case of you think democracy itself,

304
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,000
like the practice of voting is just a bad practice,

305
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,800
or do you think that democracy could work,

306
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,920
but it's not working and it's been corrupted?

307
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,360
Well, you've got to do it correctly, I believe,

308
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,400
if you're going to do it,

309
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,960
but you have to have laws that make sense

310
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,640
and so forth in that regard.

311
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:25,480
Right, so you're not anti-democracy.

312
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,640
It's just that you think that democracy

313
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,600
right now isn't working.

314
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,300
Well, I'm not anti-democracy, not necessarily, no,

315
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:35,320
but whatever the best political structure

316
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,000
for any given country is, is whatever it is, I'd say.

317
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
So, certainly I don't believe

318
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,380
that every nation should ascribe to democracy,

319
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,840
but I think-

320
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,520
But America should?

321
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,860
Well, I think maybe there can be some regards

322
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,340
where it works, I guess,

323
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:56,680
but ultimately, by and large, I'd say I'm against it

324
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:00,600
because I think that you can produce

325
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,880
a better world without it.

326
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,840
It doesn't even make sense necessarily to me

327
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,960
that everybody gets a vote,

328
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,760
everybody gets treated as they're equal.

329
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:13,600
The government asks everybody's opinion on these matters.

330
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,480
I don't think that that even makes sense necessarily, so.

331
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,320
Go ahead.

332
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,000
So, wait, I just want to make this clear.

333
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,940
So, that sounds like that even if democracy

334
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:23,360
was perfectly functioning,

335
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,440
you still wouldn't want democracy

336
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,600
because you don't think democracy itself is good.

337
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,720
So, it's not that democracy is currently broken,

338
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,520
it's that democracy isn't good, even when it's working.

339
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,880
Is that what you think?

340
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,420
Like I said, I think maybe it can work in some regards,

341
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:40,080
but yeah, I'm generally by and large against it.

342
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,860
Yeah, especially in the U.S. more so,

343
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:44,560
but I can't really speak to other places that well.

344
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,400
Oh, that's fine.

345
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,900
We can talk about America, that's fine.

346
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,320
Why are you against democracy in the U.S.?

347
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,200
Well, because look at the situation, man.

348
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,680
Look at what it's been able to produce.

349
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,320
Look at what we're dealing with today.

350
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,800
It's produced-

351
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,200
What if it actually worked?

352
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,120
It wasn't rigged as you think.

353
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,600
Assume for a minute that the elections

354
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,760
were all actually not fraudulent, all right?

355
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,860
Even in that situation,

356
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:09,120
would you say that not democracy is not good?

357
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,800
Well, even, yeah, yeah, yes.

358
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,120
As for America, yeah.

359
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,300
Because look at what it's produced societally.

360
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:19,520
Look at what the point, look at what it's led us to, man.

361
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,320
The people in America are dying all over.

362
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,480
They're killing each other.

363
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,400
Nobody has anything.

364
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,040
Everybody's 400 pounds.

365
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,660
The government is shutting everything down.

366
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:28,400
The mad scientists have taken over.

367
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,800
Biden's 800 years old with a voice changer.

368
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,800
He's got an application for the illegal aliens

369
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,040
and he's sniffing the youth, man.

370
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,880
Okay, don't go on a whole monologue

371
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,640
because I don't know how much time he has, all right?

372
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,480
I don't want to-

373
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,200
To be fair, I kind of enjoy some of these.

374
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,320
Yeah, I don't want to make you feel like

375
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,240
you're wasting your time here.

376
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,200
There's no justice.

377
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,920
Nobody believes in what's right.

378
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,720
There's no, you have tremendous problems in all of this.

379
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,560
I know what you mean.

380
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,400
I know what you mean.

381
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:55,960
It's just that, so like, did you vote Trump in 2016?

382
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,300
Yeah, I voted for Trump twice, yeah.

383
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,320
Right, right, yeah.

384
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:02,640
And do you think that democracy worked in 2016 then?

385
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:11,280
Worked, I don't, to some degree, I guess, sure.

386
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,840
It's always working to some degree.

387
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,920
I don't know, that's kind of a weird question, worked.

388
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,040
Well, because it sounds like your problem

389
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,080
is not necessarily with democracy.

390
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,120
It's just with the outcome, right?

391
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,480
So if Trump actually won 2020,

392
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,120
you'd be a lot more cool with it.

393
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,680
I mean, it would be better,

394
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,120
but I don't know necessarily if I'd be cool with it.

395
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,920
I think there are problems that need, that are,

396
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,940
do you agree, do you think that democracy

397
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:40,000
always produces the best results for any given society?

398
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,880
No.

399
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,720
Okay, okay.

400
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,600
So you're not even for democracy necessarily.

401
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,520
I am in America.

402
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,400
I am in the West.

403
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:49,920
Oh, okay, so you, so do you, hold on, sir, sir, sir.

404
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,080
Has democracy produced,

405
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,360
has democracy in America produced better results

406
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,820
than a fascist state?

407
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,560
Yes.

408
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,560
How do you know that, you fucking idiot?

409
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,460
Tell me how, tell me, hey, stupid fuck.

410
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:02,760
Tell me how you know that.

411
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,360
You can't open your eyes all the way, tell me.

412
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,280
How do you know that, bud?

413
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,560
That democracy's produced better results

414
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,520
than a fascist state?

415
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,960
Yeah, yeah, tell me how you know that.

416
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,600
Or a fascist dictator would.

417
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,440
Tell me how you know that.

418
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,260
Tell me how you know that.

419
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:16,180
We'll look at, okay, I can tell you.

420
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:18,700
Look at the results of all the various fascist states

421
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,280
that we've seen in history.

422
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,860
That does, that says nothing to me.

423
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,280
That's absolutely retarded

424
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,560
and it's an unbelievably stupid take.

425
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,180
So I disagree totally.

426
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:28,840
So are you saying, hold on, hold on.

427
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,960
That as those, those would not necessarily

428
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,180
play out in America at all.

429
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:34,880
That would not be what happens 100%.

430
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,720
Just to be clear,

431
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:39,080
are you doing the real fascism has never been tried thing?

432
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,720
No, I'm saying that you are stupid, man.

433
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,280
If you don't believe that there are better systems

434
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:48,840
that could produce results superior than democracy.

435
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,680
Here's what I'll say.

436
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,760
Dude, that's just stupid.

437
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,880
I think that like, nobody's gonna ever say

438
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,720
that like we have like the perfect best system

439
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,880
like right now and nothing could ever be improved upon.

440
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:01,360
No, no person with like a half a fucking brain cell

441
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,280
would say that.

442
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,480
But what we're saying, I think this is what,

443
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,080
there's a lot of syllables.

444
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,200
Can I call you anything but.

445
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,040
I think you're my name.

446
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:11,860
My name's Dev.

447
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:12,700
Dev, okay.

448
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:13,540
My real name.

449
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:15,400
Two government agents, two government agents here.

450
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,400
I don't think that anybody.

451
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,720
I work for YouTube, baby.

452
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,640
I don't work for the government.

453
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:22,440
But I don't think that either of us are saying

454
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:24,480
that like this is a perfect system

455
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,480
and I've never fucking said that.

456
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,480
But like you can always like obviously improve

457
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:33,800
on the system, but you have to like improve on the system

458
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,140
and like fix the things that are broken.

459
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:38,600
But like why fix what's not broken, right?

460
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,200
I guess my question is more that

461
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,760
why do you think an American fascist state

462
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,560
would be better than what you have now?

463
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,800
Why fix what's broken?

464
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:51,040
It's all, cause it's all broken to answer both of you guys.

465
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,000
Yeah, fix what's not.

466
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,400
It's all broken.

467
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,640
To answer both of you guys at once, it's all broken.

468
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,660
It's all not working how it should.

469
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:02,280
It's all, the corporations rule the country, man.

470
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,920
Nobody believes in what's right.

471
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,500
The people are like being turned into robots.

472
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,560
The people are being like.

473
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,400
Why would a fascist state fix that?

474
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:13,320
A fascist state could actually maybe, I believe,

475
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:16,960
produce better results than a democracy has produced.

476
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:17,780
But why?

477
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,720
Because I think it could be managed better.

478
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,440
I think that it could be altered.

479
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,000
It could be controlled better.

480
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,040
I think that you have problems that are,

481
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,840
people are, criminals are voting for.

482
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,720
Like our legal, our political system isn't about

483
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:34,240
necessarily the best and brightest rising to the top.

484
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,740
Most of these politicians are just front people

485
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:40,160
for their constituents or their financiers

486
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,480
or their backers and the likes.

487
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,680
So like they vote in ways that aren't,

488
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:49,880
like that they know are not necessarily the best.

489
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,760
Democrats vote illegal people in so they can get them

490
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:55,000
to vote for their party someday, potentially.

491
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,040
Okay, I understand the criticism.

492
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,880
And there's actually some decent criticism in there.

493
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,320
It's just, why do you think a fascist state

494
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,320
would manage that situation better?

495
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:08,120
Because I think it could be, you could easily control.

496
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:11,200
I think, oh man, because when you have that,

497
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,960
you have like a realm of possibility that's different

498
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,760
than there are gridlocked bureaucracy now.

499
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:23,760
Our gridlock bureaucracy that can't change anything

500
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,640
or takes forever to change it.

501
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,560
We live in the world of problems, man.

502
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,480
And it's like a fascist leader could come

503
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:34,880
and clean that up in, in my opinion, rather quickly

504
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,200
versus what we have now.

505
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,760
Like, you don't think so?

506
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,720
You don't think a fascist leader who believed

507
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,680
in the right thing, who wanted to do what's right,

508
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:45,120
could just come in and produce results like crazy?

509
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,440
You're skeptical of that?

510
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,680
You think democracy is producing better results

511
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,280
than a fascist leader could?

512
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,120
A fascist leader could give you a real cut?

513
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:53,960
I understand the point of view.

514
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:56,120
I understand the point of view because for example,

515
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,760
you know what NIMBYism is, right?

516
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,240
Oh no, NIMBYism?

517
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:05,080
N-I-M-B-Y, NIMBY means not in my backyard, all right?

518
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:08,040
NIMBYism is a problem unique to democracy.

519
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:10,000
So what the idea is, is, you know,

520
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,920
let's say that your country needs a nuclear power plant

521
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,880
or it needs a prison or it needs something

522
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,360
that is necessary, but it's unpopular

523
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,760
for the neighborhood that it's built in, right?

524
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,240
And so what you have is you have people

525
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,320
who are democratic voters, they turn around

526
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,120
and they say, well, you know what?

527
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,600
I know we need the nuclear power plant,

528
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,400
we need the prison, but I don't want it in my neighborhood

529
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,360
because I don't feel comfortable with that.

530
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:35,200
And so everyone votes to not have the necessary

531
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,200
infrastructure in their neighborhood,

532
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,680
so not in my backyard.

533
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,840
And so it gets built nowhere.

534
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,560
And that's a problem unique to democracy is that

535
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,560
people tend to vote in their own interests.

536
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,080
And when that interest doesn't line up

537
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,440
with the wider society, society tends to suffer.

538
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,280
So-

539
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:57,200
Yeah, when that interest doesn't do what's right

540
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,240
for the country, it doesn't produce the right result,

541
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,800
then yeah, there's a problem there, obviously.

542
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:05,440
You know, people are voting Democrats for free stuff

543
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,920
and illegal aliens are just pouring in our country

544
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,840
at this point in time.

545
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,360
So here's the thing, so you could have, for example,

546
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:15,600
a benevolent dictator who says, you know what?

547
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,880
We need the nuclear power plant and we need the prison.

548
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,000
It doesn't matter if it's unpopular.

549
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,120
I'm going to do what's necessary

550
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,440
and I'm going to build the infrastructure.

551
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,680
And if individual people don't like it,

552
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,440
well, they can suffer because fuck you,

553
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,600
we have to get what we have to get.

554
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,720
And that's a pretty reasonable critique,

555
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,800
a pretty reasonable authoritarian critique of democracy.

556
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,040
So I understand your point of view.

557
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:40,000
I've done a lot of reading of fascists recently

558
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,620
for some projects that I've have going on.

559
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,060
I know what's going on.

560
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:46,700
The reason that I brought up elite theory

561
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,420
is elite theory is basically,

562
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:52,180
it's a description of how governments operate.

563
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:54,500
It's a theory of how governments operate, right?

564
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:58,580
And the idea is that a small minority of people

565
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:02,280
and they consist of members of the economic elite

566
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:05,220
and people who make policy in government,

567
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:07,420
they hold the most power in society

568
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:10,700
and that that power operates independently

569
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,580
of democratic elections, all right?

570
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:13,740
So oftentimes-

571
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:15,380
I probably agree with that to some degree.

572
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:17,500
I mean, independently to some degree.

573
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,380
I mean, go ahead.

574
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:22,860
Right, so you've been talking about

575
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:24,500
an American fascist state

576
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,060
where a dictator could come in and clean everything up.

577
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:29,520
But at the same time, you've also been decrying

578
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,660
the very same use of that power

579
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:34,660
that you want to seize by other people.

580
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,180
It's a cabal of people

581
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:38,240
that don't necessarily have government control.

582
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,340
You're talking about elites in all different regards

583
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:42,100
that don't necessarily have anything to do

584
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,140
with the government, right?

585
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:43,960
I mean-

586
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:44,800
But here's the thing.

587
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,780
You would make the exact same elite structure.

588
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:49,440
That's what a fascist state is.

589
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:53,100
It's not some libertarian decentralized paradise.

590
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,740
It would be different elites.

591
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:56,860
It would be different elites.

592
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:59,460
The elites that you agree with is what he's saying.

593
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:02,240
Yes, so your problem isn't with the nature of power

594
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,700
as it currently exists.

595
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:06,220
Your problem is with who is currently wielding it.

596
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:08,340
You want the actual structure to be the same.

597
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:10,540
You just want somebody else in charge of it.

598
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:13,140
Well, those people don't have any power

599
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:14,860
akin to a fascist leader now.

600
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:17,980
So in that regard, you're comparing elitism

601
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:20,300
in two different guards that are not comparable,

602
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,140
in my opinion.

603
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:23,700
Oh, sure, you want more elitism, right?

604
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,340
Okay, here.

605
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:27,780
I'm gonna grab something real quick.

606
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,020
Okay, sure.

607
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:31,160
When it comes to elite theory, I'm gonna post this.

608
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:34,540
If you wanna bring it up on screen so and so, you can.

609
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:35,860
You agree that there are elites

610
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:37,560
that are controlling things, right?

611
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,240
Of course there are, of course there are, yes.

612
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,880
I don't think anyone can disagree with that.

613
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:44,580
Okay, and then these elites have more influence on,

614
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:46,440
they have a tremendous influence on society

615
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,340
compared to your average person, right?

616
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,360
Of course, yes, absolutely.

617
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,700
Okay, okay.

618
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,460
So this is a study.

619
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:55,480
This is what most people who believe

620
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,560
in this form of government lean on.

621
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:58,800
They lean on this study here.

622
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,400
It's from Cambridge University,

623
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,560
Testing Theories of American Politics,

624
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,920
Elites, Interest Groups, and Average Citizens.

625
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,560
Let me just tell you what this says, okay?

626
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,840
Real quick, real quick, okay?

627
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:11,520
So the data in the study is basically that

628
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,800
if you take, if you divide people by income,

629
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,560
income brackets, right?

630
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:20,980
And then you discover who they vote for

631
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:23,240
and why they vote for them.

632
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:26,260
If the person that they voted for wins,

633
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:28,600
the reason that they voted for them

634
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:33,600
is less likely to become policy the poorer that you are,

635
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:34,720
if that makes sense.

636
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:39,120
So basically, let's say poor people voted for Trump

637
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,880
in 2016 for policy A and rich people voted for Trump

638
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,760
in 2016 for policy B, all right?

639
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,660
Once Trump got into office,

640
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:50,000
the chance that he would implement policy A

641
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,640
for the poor people is around 0%.

642
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,840
Meanwhile, the chance that he would implement policy B

643
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:59,040
for the rich people is around 60%.

644
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,360
So, oh, he just took off.

645
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,200
Oh no, he's back.

646
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,400
Okay, well, I'd have to look at this.

647
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,680
That doesn't sound right to me

648
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:08,880
that just because of your financial situation,

649
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,560
you're more likely or unlikely to have a politician

650
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,920
do any given thing for you is,

651
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,280
I mean, I probably to some degree that's true,

652
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,000
but I don't think the way you're framing it

653
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,440
is very dishonest, I feel, but okay.

654
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,360
How do you mean?

655
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,200
I mean, it's-

656
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:25,580
Well, because it's the idea that like,

657
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:27,560
if you had large numbers of poor people

658
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:32,000
pushing for something like versus like rich people,

659
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,040
like I just don't, the way you said there

660
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,280
in regard to the poor people,

661
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,900
like it's just Trump's doesn't do anything

662
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:37,740
for the poor people,

663
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:38,920
it only does things for the rich people.

664
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:41,880
That's like laughably retarded, so.

665
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,720
Well, yeah, but I mean,

666
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,340
if we're talking about a cabal of people

667
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:47,320
who run the government, this is exactly how it would be.

668
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:50,200
It's not a cabal of people who run the government though,

669
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,160
the elites, like.

670
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,000
No.

671
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,080
Do you think elitism and fascism are the same thing?

672
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:59,900
Really quick, I'm gonna help you explain your point, okay?

673
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,980
So like, I think the way that he would describe things

674
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:03,640
is that the elites aren't necessarily

675
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,820
like in control of government directly.

676
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:08,460
They're also like pushing culture in such a way

677
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:13,460
as to like make people more subservient

678
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:15,060
or to make people, you know,

679
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:16,580
like he keeps on bringing the fact

680
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:19,780
that people are like fatter now than they used to be.

681
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:22,020
So like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

682
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:25,100
So you're going more down like a James Burnham

683
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:27,720
managerial revolution route, right?

684
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:30,460
No, sir, I believe in what's right

685
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:32,500
and I believe in fixing America, man.

686
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:35,100
I believe in stopping terrorism,

687
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,460
stopping doing what's right.

688
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:39,180
Yeah, that's what I want to happen, yeah.

689
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:42,340
I think a fascist leader could speed rocket that.

690
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:45,340
Right, so what I mean to say is James Burnham,

691
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:46,940
he theorized this idea.

692
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:51,940
And the idea was basically that Marx's analysis of classes,

693
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:53,660
the bourgeoisie and the proletariat

694
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:58,660
had been completely rendered useless by the post-war era.

695
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:05,940
And so he theorized of, he called it the managerial class.

696
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:08,520
And I think people like Moldbug came along later

697
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:11,060
and they talk about the cathedral in the same way, right?

698
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:12,380
But the idea of the managerial class,

699
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:15,060
the managerial class is a class of people

700
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:19,260
who they defy Marxist expectations because they own nothing.

701
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:20,780
They own no property,

702
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:23,720
but they control massive amounts of wealth and property

703
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,240
because they're managers, they're not owners,

704
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,080
they're managers.

705
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:29,380
So they have control without ownership.

706
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:33,300
And generally right-leaning people view the government

707
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:36,940
and view elites as being members of this managerial class

708
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:38,780
who don't actually own all that much,

709
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:41,180
but they wield tremendous amounts of power.

710
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,340
Is that?

711
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:45,180
Oh, he left again.

712
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:47,820
What you said was just like weird and confusing.

713
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:49,740
So what?

714
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:52,940
Managerial class, what's your point?

715
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:55,820
Well, does that sound like how you're viewing this?

716
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:57,460
Joe Biden isn't like super rich,

717
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:59,620
but he still wields all of this power, right?

718
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:00,880
And that's what the elites are.

719
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,060
They're not like the hyper wealthy.

720
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:04,580
They're just the-

721
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:05,900
I agree that you can have elites

722
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:08,940
in probably a lot of different regards, sure.

723
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:11,060
We were in terms of government and wealth.

724
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:13,740
And I mean, there's not many things beside that.

725
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:14,620
I mean, I guess that's it.

726
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:16,940
I mean, but yeah, you can have elites that have,

727
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:18,620
you know, financial backings.

728
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:21,180
And what are you talking about with the managerial class?

729
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:22,260
What was the point of saying that?

730
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:24,020
Like, I just don't understand.

731
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:27,820
So every time we've gone down a few rabbit holes now

732
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:28,660
in this conversation.

733
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:32,260
And it seems like every single time that we discuss this,

734
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:35,100
you don't actually want to change much about the way

735
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:37,020
that society is structured.

736
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:39,960
You just want to be, you want your guy to have the power.

737
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,140
That's it.

738
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:44,380
You know, cause like everything that you said.

739
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:46,380
It's not about, it's not about, it's not, sir.

740
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:48,380
It's not about my guy having the power.

741
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:51,160
It's about what's right and what's saying

742
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:53,140
and what's rational prevailing.

743
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:57,860
But you think that your people are the ones

744
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:01,020
that would be able to like do what is good.

745
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:01,860
Yeah, I do.

746
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:04,100
Leftists think that too.

747
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,420
Yeah, exactly.

748
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:08,020
Other people think that that's what's going on

749
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,420
with their side as well.

750
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:11,340
Like when I was a, when I was a socialist,

751
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:15,180
I tried so hard to find ways to like, you know,

752
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:17,980
like pretzel myself into a position that like,

753
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:20,900
or into like figuring out how like Joseph Stalin

754
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:23,740
wasn't like nearly as bad as he was, right?

755
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:26,020
But like, then I realized that that was fucking retarded

756
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:28,500
as fuck because he was a really bad dude.

757
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:29,580
I don't think he's so bad.

758
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:30,420
No.

759
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:31,980
I think he was a real bad,

760
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:33,980
he's a bad hombre in my opinion, but.

761
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:38,220
You hear guys like Vash and you listen to this guy talk

762
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:40,140
and he talks for like 15 minutes.

763
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:42,780
And what he's actually saying is good things are good

764
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:43,860
and bad things are bad.

765
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:45,900
And it's like, well, it doesn't tell you anything.

766
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,500
You know what I mean?

767
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:50,540
So you keep saying, I want to do what's right.

768
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,060
Well, what is what's right?

769
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:53,020
What is the good?

770
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:55,620
Like, what are you appealing to here beyond,

771
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:58,300
it just seems like you're just appealing to power.

772
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:01,060
Yeah, well, what's right is obviously not this, sir.

773
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:02,020
That's what it's to say.

774
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:05,820
I mean, you, you know, you say that it sounds complicated

775
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:08,700
to say what's right is right and what's bad is bad.

776
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,900
But I think that like, if people actually,

777
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,580
the thing is people don't know what's right

778
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:14,260
and what's wrong anymore in our society.

779
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:17,060
So they go, so that's how we have the society we do today.

780
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:18,260
People don't, quite frankly,

781
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:20,020
people don't care what's right anymore.

782
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:21,780
How did people know in the past what was right

783
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:23,460
and what was wrong?

784
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:24,620
I don't think that they,

785
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:27,420
I think maybe they had a different, I don't know.

786
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:29,140
Did they know in the past for certain?

787
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:30,420
I don't know if I think that they knew

788
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:31,580
in the past for certain.

789
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:36,860
But I think that it's obvious that things aren't right now

790
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:40,260
and you can't tell that democracy's not,

791
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:42,380
okay, but you think that it's going to be fixed

792
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:43,220
through democracy.

793
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:45,580
You think that what the best ideas are going to prevail.

794
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:47,500
Why haven't they prevailed already?

795
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:49,580
Why hasn't democracy led to a better results

796
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:50,900
than we have now?

797
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:52,500
Why is, because like-

798
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,900
I can answer that.

799
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:56,580
I don't think democracy is the problem, all right?

800
00:29:56,580 --> 00:30:00,180
I think the reason that democracy is failing,

801
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:01,820
and I don't even think it's really failing that much,

802
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:03,380
but there are some problems with it, obviously.

803
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:05,060
The problem is the US government, sir.

804
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:06,860
The problem is the US government, go ahead.

805
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:09,220
Well, any problems that we're experiencing

806
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:10,780
regarding democracy right now,

807
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:15,540
it's not a problem of democracy or of liberal government

808
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:17,300
or of the types of governments that we have

809
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:18,700
or anything like that.

810
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:21,660
It's that there's something else going on with people

811
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:24,420
and that the cracks in democracy are a symptom

812
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:25,580
of a different problem

813
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:27,660
and changing government won't fix that.

814
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:31,660
Are you, how would it not fix that?

815
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:34,980
Because not everything comes from the state.

816
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:38,660
Okay, not everything, but the state could,

817
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:40,060
dude, if the state wanted to,

818
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:42,460
if the US government wanted to clean up the mess

819
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:45,420
that we are in today, they very easily could

820
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:47,180
if the right person was in office

821
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:50,380
and decided to do that, but they won't.

822
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:51,220
They won't fix it.

823
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:52,420
They don't care.

824
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:54,860
They're okay feeding the citizens slop

825
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:57,940
until revolution transpires, and that's who they are.

826
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:59,940
They don't care about you.

827
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:03,460
You've said slop a lot, but where's the slop?

828
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:06,740
In every regard, I've been laying it out.

829
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:09,380
Look at our society, you stupid dude.

830
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:10,460
It's filthy.

831
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:13,500
Okay, so you can't go to the grocery store

832
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:15,700
and buy broccoli instead of a hamburger?

833
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:18,980
Like you guys have broccoli in America, don't you?

834
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:20,860
Broccoli is good for you.

835
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:24,460
What, oh, sir, you don't have broccoli in Canada?

836
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:25,300
Yeah, we have broccoli.

837
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,140
I eat it every day.

838
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:26,960
It's good for you.

839
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:27,800
It's healthy.

840
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,740
It's not slop.

841
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:30,780
Oh, the broccoli is not slop, man.

842
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:33,140
Okay, that's obviously not what I'm talking about though.

843
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:34,700
What are you talking about?

844
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:36,900
Do you mean like cultural slop or not food?

845
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:37,740
Is that what you mean?

846
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:40,940
No, slop in all these different regards, man.

847
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:42,980
Like with the media as an example,

848
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:44,340
they feed you gray slop.

849
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:46,620
Our justice system, which isn't about justice,

850
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:48,500
feeds the citizens gray slop.

851
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:51,420
The government that's ran by a senile child sniffer

852
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:55,160
is in a sense feeding the citizens gray slop.

853
00:31:55,160 --> 00:32:00,160
Like our economic system, which is tremendously unjust

854
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:02,460
in some degree, in my opinion.

855
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:05,200
Yeah, I think that's feeding the citizens gray slop.

856
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,040
Yeah.

857
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,720
Are you going for a socialist revolution now

858
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,380
or are you talking about the economic system?

859
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:11,520
Oh, I'm saying that.

860
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:14,600
I'm saying that if you've got, hold on, hold on, hold on.

861
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:17,440
I literally agree that if you've got mass wealth inequality

862
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,200
to the point where everything is horrible,

863
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,080
then yeah, that's a problem.

864
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:24,480
So, and obviously if you have mass wealth inequality

865
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,760
to the point where everybody is dying

866
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:30,440
and people have to like work like as slaves

867
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:33,440
and it's like the slaves are revolting

868
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:36,040
and it's like totally unjust and everybody knows it

869
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:38,400
and such, like that's obviously an issue.

870
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,380
That's obviously not gonna be productive for any nation.

871
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:41,220
Go ahead.

872
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:44,420
I figured a fascist doesn't mind inequality

873
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:45,720
as a general rule.

874
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:47,420
Well, sure.

875
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:50,780
Yeah, I mean, but I'm not a fascist necessarily, so.

876
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:53,300
You just advocated for a fascist government.

877
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:55,380
Okay, but again, I'm not a fascist necessarily.

878
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:56,980
I mean, you could advocate for a fascist government

879
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:58,620
and not be a fascist, right?

880
00:32:58,620 --> 00:32:59,980
Here's the, here's where I-

881
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:01,180
Is it like your second choice?

882
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:02,740
Like, what do you mean?

883
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:05,340
This is the like breakdown in communication

884
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:07,380
every single time I have this conversation with them

885
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:10,860
because this isn't me and this guy's like first conversation.

886
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:12,480
Okay.

887
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

888
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:18,500
So like, he doesn't have a holistic like worldview

889
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:24,460
that he wants to see like put out there necessarily.

890
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:26,660
He just doesn't like what's going on right now.

891
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:30,740
He doesn't have a form of government

892
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:33,920
that he particularly like enjoys,

893
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,340
but he just won like,

894
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:37,620
except for like some sort of authoritarian state.

895
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:40,580
Like he sucks off like current Russia

896
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:43,980
and like communist China pretty hardcore

897
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:47,020
because I, fuck, I don't know.

898
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:51,420
But like he claims to want freedom of speech,

899
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:54,780
but he also loves like the like tamping down

900
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:57,940
of political opposition like they do in Russia and China.

901
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:01,220
So like there's this like big amorphous political system

902
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:04,020
that he like kind of more enjoys,

903
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:06,100
but it's largely predicated on just like-

904
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:08,940
I want good things and I don't like bad things

905
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:12,060
and the bad things need to be like tamped out

906
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:13,740
with like brutal efficiency

907
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:16,340
and the good things need to be implemented

908
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:21,140
so that we can have whatever the good is.

909
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:22,740
I think I understand, I think I understand.

910
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:24,540
I mean, I don't know how you get the hyper efficiency

911
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:26,060
without any sort of competition, right?

912
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:28,860
Like any kind of command economy or command structure

913
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:31,060
generally leads to lack of inefficiency

914
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:33,460
because there's no competition pressure.

915
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:34,300
True.

916
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:37,060
Well, who's the competition for the US government?

917
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:39,820
Well, that is the problem.

918
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:41,420
It's the parties within

919
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:44,380
and the like sub factions within those parties

920
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:45,220
is the argument.

921
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:48,140
I don't know if Dev agrees with that, but.

922
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:49,860
There's no competition for that.

923
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:51,620
If there was a breakaway state

924
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:53,260
that actually competed with the government

925
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:56,460
and fixed the laws and like actually raised the children

926
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:57,300
and taught them good things.

927
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:58,860
Well, breakaway state would be like fixing

928
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:00,500
the like system itself.

929
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,340
It would just be, you know,

930
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:04,940
that you are advocating for revolution at that point.

931
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:07,580
I'm saying, well, then maybe that is

932
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:08,420
what I'm advocating for.

933
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:10,260
I mean, I'm advocating to,

934
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:12,300
I'm trying to make people's lives better.

935
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:13,700
And I'm saying that this,

936
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:16,580
the way we're living now is unacceptable.

937
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:19,500
The way we're living now is it doesn't even make sense.

938
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:20,340
It's horrible.

939
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:21,180
It's bizarre.

940
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:23,460
Everything is a land of injustice.

941
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:24,820
So many of the problems that you bring up,

942
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:25,940
I don't think are problems

943
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:28,620
that the average person actually deals with, right?

944
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:29,460
I feel like-

945
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,180
It is, I just dealt with injustice, man.

946
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:33,020
That's what I was about to say.

947
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:34,140
People that are fed through-

948
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:35,580
No, you are not the average person.

949
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:37,180
You are you, right?

950
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:38,220
But like the average person,

951
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:40,460
like in the past, you know,

952
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:42,380
ever since I stopped streaming full time,

953
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:43,940
like I've touched a lot of grass.

954
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:45,940
I've met a lot of people who are actual

955
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:47,580
like regular people, right?

956
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:48,620
And they don't talk about like

957
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:49,900
the government's feeding a slot.

958
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:51,460
They don't fucking like feel like

959
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:53,780
that's what the big issues in the country are, right?

960
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:56,340
They're worried about like the fact that

961
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:57,460
like if they're liberals,

962
00:35:57,460 --> 00:36:01,060
they feel like the government is being,

963
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:03,980
like attempted to be taken over by like fascist factions.

964
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:04,820
Yeah, because-

965
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:05,660
If you're on the right wing,

966
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:06,500
if you're on the right wing,

967
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,900
then you believe that like the liberals

968
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:13,900
are using like bad intentions

969
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:18,700
to try and like circumvent the laws to steal elections.

970
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:21,020
But like more personally to them,

971
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:23,020
the average person is more concerned

972
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:25,220
with like the meat and potato issues,

973
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:26,500
as much as I hate to call them that.

974
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:29,420
Like, you know, inflation, cost of living,

975
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:31,900
you know, how expensive it is to afford a house,

976
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:33,220
how difficult it is to find a job.

977
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:35,580
They might not believe that revolution is possible.

978
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:36,420
I mean, I'm much younger than-

979
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:39,460
No, most people don't want revolution.

980
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:41,300
Yeah, that's true.

981
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:42,580
There's a lot of older people

982
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:44,140
that do not support revolution,

983
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:46,340
but I think you're gonna see really the young people.

984
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:49,940
Do you think I hang out with a bunch of like anti-communist

985
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:53,620
or anti-fascists, like 70 year olds?

986
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:56,060
Maybe people don't support, maybe people don't.

987
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:57,460
I do think there are a lot of people

988
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:58,740
that, more now so than ever,

989
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:00,060
that do support revolution.

990
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:01,700
But I think a lot of people might believe

991
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:03,900
revolution's unreasonable or can never happen

992
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:04,740
or these sort of things,

993
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:06,620
or they're just not capable of it

994
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:07,980
or things of like that nature.

995
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:09,540
So, you know, there's plenty of reasons

996
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:12,540
why they'd focus more on less substantial issues

997
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:15,220
than total revolution, but I'm going for it all

998
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:18,300
in the sense that I see everything broken with the US.

999
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:21,460
I can see this whole, the US government is an operation.

1000
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:24,060
You have to view it like an operation.

1001
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:25,240
Probably other countries too,

1002
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,500
but especially the US government,

1003
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:27,820
that's all I really know about.

1004
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:30,780
And they're an operation that doesn't know how to,

1005
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:32,820
like they're bad operators.

1006
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:34,740
These operators are like taking the train

1007
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:38,380
down the wrong railroad and I'm screaming at them,

1008
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:41,020
do what's right, take it down the right path.

1009
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:41,840
And they-

1010
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:42,680
Hey, hold on, hold on.

1011
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:43,600
I wanna drill down on this.

1012
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:46,780
How do you know that what you think is right

1013
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:47,980
is actually right?

1014
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:52,820
Well, I think that, well, right is a,

1015
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:55,220
we can go into the whole morality conversation

1016
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:56,540
if you want to, but I think-

1017
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:58,260
We have to, because you're saying,

1018
00:37:58,260 --> 00:37:59,700
do what's right over and over.

1019
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:01,060
That's like your main point,

1020
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:02,380
you have to live in that conversation.

1021
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:05,780
Well, I mean, we do to some degree, I guess maybe,

1022
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:09,100
but mostly I'm just talking about results being produced.

1023
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:11,380
I'm talking about just like normal,

1024
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:13,040
good things happening to people.

1025
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,540
Like I'm not, I don't wanna go like nitty gritty

1026
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:16,940
about moral issues.

1027
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:19,940
It's good if people are living, people are prosperous,

1028
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:22,500
people are successful, people are happy,

1029
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:26,220
people trust the government and the government trusts them.

1030
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:27,580
Like these sort of things.

1031
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:30,460
Like people are, people feel like they're living in like a-

1032
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:31,380
A utopia.

1033
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:35,740
Honest place, I guess, to some degree, I'd say,

1034
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:37,340
where it's not the core,

1035
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:40,060
it's not McDonald's arches ruling the society

1036
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:42,660
and mass injustice transpiring, but rather-

1037
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:45,040
God is telling us to comment on this, holy fuck.

1038
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:45,880
No, I get it.

1039
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:50,360
So you want a return to like the 1950s high trust society

1040
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,340
where you could walk down the streets of New York

1041
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:54,340
and not get fucking mugged or like stop-

1042
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:57,020
Well, I think there are countries

1043
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:58,620
that have already erased crime.

1044
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:01,100
There are countries where crime, there is no crime.

1045
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:03,400
Our government isn't capable of erasing crime,

1046
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,420
but it's already happened in other places.

1047
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:09,060
And I believe it's possible to produce a society

1048
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:10,860
where there is no crime.

1049
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:14,260
Great, so you want that high trust society back

1050
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:18,140
where it's like I said, you could walk down the road

1051
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:20,260
in a city and not get mugged by a random person.

1052
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:22,220
There's not random violence in the streets.

1053
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:25,100
You see videos of random violence go viral all the time

1054
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:27,300
on TikTok, that's what you're talking about, right?

1055
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,140
Yeah, it's horrible.

1056
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:29,220
Yeah, I think that's horrible.

1057
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:31,060
So here's the thing,

1058
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:35,000
authoritarian systems always destroy high trust societies

1059
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,260
because everyone's an informant for the party.

1060
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:38,720
A fascist state wouldn't do this.

1061
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:39,940
It would do the opposite of it.

1062
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:42,460
It would make everyone distrustful of everyone else

1063
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:44,720
because that guy might be a snitch.

1064
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,660
I disagree that that's what necessarily would happen.

1065
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:53,020
Can you give an example of a fascist government

1066
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:54,940
or like a highly authoritarian government

1067
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:56,460
that that didn't happen in?

1068
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:59,740
There wasn't like, I mean, to some degree,

1069
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:03,400
there's always gonna be trust in an authoritarian country.

1070
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:07,900
I mean, I'd probably argue, but I mean,

1071
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:10,220
you're saying it's just less trust than,

1072
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:13,100
you would literally argue that we, like,

1073
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:16,140
I mean, within any government,

1074
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:18,580
there's gonna be levels of trust.

1075
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:20,620
If we're just talking about trust,

1076
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:24,020
but you would argue that like a fascist state,

1077
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:26,020
there would be less trust amongst the people

1078
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:27,740
than what we have now?

1079
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:29,020
Yes.

1080
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:31,800
No, well, it's not necessarily about trust

1081
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,460
within the government.

1082
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:34,660
I mean, that's a different conversation,

1083
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:35,700
but I think that you could produce,

1084
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:37,660
I think there could be a fascist state

1085
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:38,860
where people have trust in the government.

1086
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:40,540
Probably people had trust in the government

1087
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:41,640
in the Nazi state,

1088
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:46,060
but it's more about the people's,

1089
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:48,380
I'd say it's more about the people's trust in government

1090
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:49,860
than anything, I think.

1091
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:50,820
But even then, it would be destroyed,

1092
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:54,620
because for example, it's very easy in Nazi Germany

1093
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:56,640
for one person to just trust their neighbors,

1094
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:59,100
because who knows if they're hiding something

1095
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:00,380
that they should be reporting,

1096
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:02,900
or if their neighbor's gonna report on them.

1097
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:04,940
Who knows if that's happening in America today?

1098
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:07,640
And you're talking about reporting, like what kind of,

1099
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:09,540
yeah, that's, what are you talking about reporting?

1100
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:10,900
Listen, listen, listen, okay, okay, so,

1101
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:13,020
do you call back- What if somebody reports,

1102
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:13,860
what if somebody reports,

1103
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:16,780
what if I report my neighbor for being black,

1104
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:18,300
or just cause I don't like him or something?

1105
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:20,020
What are you talking about, reporting?

1106
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:20,840
Well, nothing's gonna happen

1107
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:21,940
because you live in a democracy, right?

1108
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:24,780
But do you recall, hold on, do you recall back-

1109
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:26,140
How do you know nothing's gonna happen?

1110
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:27,300
What happened to George Floyd?

1111
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:28,700
They pulled up and killed him,

1112
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:30,540
and we live in a democracy, right?

1113
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:32,660
Yeah, let's not get started on that one,

1114
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:35,200
because I probably have a spicier take on that than you do.

1115
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,780
But, but hold on, hold on.

1116
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:41,100
So, do you recall back during the,

1117
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:44,220
let's say the first third of the pandemic,

1118
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:47,140
there was a big uproar because having,

1119
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:48,460
at least in some countries, in some,

1120
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:49,300
I don't know about the states,

1121
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:51,180
but definitely in Canada, definitely in the UK,

1122
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:53,940
having more than like six or five people in your house

1123
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:55,420
was considered a crime.

1124
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:57,760
And so you had people snitching on their neighbors,

1125
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:58,600
being like, listen, officer-

1126
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,300
That happened in the US too, yeah.

1127
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:01,220
That happened in the US?

1128
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:02,060
Yeah, for sure.

1129
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:03,420
Yeah, see, but here's the thing.

1130
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:09,300
A democracy like the US, like Canada, like the UK,

1131
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:11,660
these democratic liberal countries

1132
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:14,180
only started becoming low trust

1133
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:17,300
to the point that you had neighbors snitching on neighbors

1134
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:19,700
when the government became more authoritarian

1135
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:21,480
to enforce these lockdown rules.

1136
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,380
The neighbors only snitched on neighbors

1137
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:29,060
when the government became more authoritarian

1138
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:30,620
to support the lockdown rules?

1139
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:31,440
Yes.

1140
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:35,280
Well, people probably snitched on their neighbors

1141
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,700
before that, but I mean,

1142
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:38,900
these aren't authoritarian countries,

1143
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:42,080
these are democracies where people are snitching.

1144
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:42,920
Yeah, but here's the thing.

1145
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,400
What is the argument exactly?

1146
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,800
You're saying they're democracies

1147
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:48,480
that operate as authoritarian style societies

1148
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,440
and then people are snitching.

1149
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:52,400
So therefore authoritarianism is bad?

1150
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:55,120
Like how naive is, how retarded naive is that?

1151
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:58,320
So the argument is that a lot of right-wing people,

1152
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:00,240
correctly in my opinion,

1153
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:02,080
said that democratic government-

1154
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:04,760
The snitching, hold on, the snitching has nothing to do-

1155
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:05,600
Hold on, just a sec.

1156
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:08,420
The snitching has nothing to do with democracy

1157
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:11,320
or any of it, authoritarianism or any of it.

1158
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:12,160
It actually does.

1159
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:13,080
It does not, sir.

1160
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:13,920
It does not.

1161
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:14,740
I'll explain it to you.

1162
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:15,580
I'll explain how it does, okay?

1163
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:20,580
So the right wing correctly criticized liberal governments

1164
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,560
for becoming more authoritarian

1165
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:25,620
as they implemented more harsh lockdown measures

1166
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:26,920
during COVID.

1167
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:29,320
That was a correct assessment of the situation.

1168
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:31,680
And a lot of people who are, let's say,

1169
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:33,420
more classically liberal, like me,

1170
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:35,280
were worried for a time that some of this stuff

1171
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:38,060
might actually remain in place for long periods.

1172
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:39,720
Turns out it didn't, that's good.

1173
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:44,520
But in a more free society,

1174
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:48,660
there's no impetus to snitch on someone, right?

1175
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:51,800
Like if you have a more authoritarian society

1176
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:53,620
where the government can come in

1177
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:57,840
and arrest people for mundane things

1178
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:58,680
like having to-

1179
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:01,640
You're not understanding what authoritarianism

1180
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:03,560
actually is or means, but okay.

1181
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:07,120
So real authoritarianism has never been tried?

1182
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:08,600
When they're arresting those people,

1183
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,600
that's on the back of democracy.

1184
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:12,960
That's not on authoritarianism, right?

1185
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,840
You're saying that, what are you saying?

1186
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:16,200
I'm confused.

1187
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:17,440
I mean, do you believe that,

1188
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:18,800
why are they arresting those people?

1189
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,320
You're saying because of fascism,

1190
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:22,020
they're snitching on their neighbor?

1191
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:23,560
Are you retarded?

1192
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:25,880
Fascism doesn't produce snitching on their neighbor

1193
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:26,720
necessarily. Hold on, let him speak

1194
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:27,600
because you're not understanding a word he's saying

1195
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:28,440
because everything he's saying-

1196
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:29,360
No, fascism does not.

1197
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:32,560
Oh, he's saying fascism produces this snitch style society.

1198
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:33,400
And I'm saying that that is-

1199
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:35,240
No, he said authoritarianism does.

1200
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:36,080
Okay, whatever.

1201
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:36,920
Okay, that's authoritarianism.

1202
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:37,960
Because socialist governments do it too.

1203
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:39,160
Socialist governments do it too.

1204
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:43,320
So for example, I actually know a YouTuber in Romania

1205
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:46,480
who has described the low trust society

1206
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:49,800
he finds himself in after several generations

1207
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:50,880
of communist rule.

1208
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,560
Authoritarian societies,

1209
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:54,580
because of the fact that they're authoritarian,

1210
00:44:54,580 --> 00:44:55,840
they have secret police,

1211
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:57,960
they have very strict laws and regulations.

1212
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:01,560
These societies produce a low trust society.

1213
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:05,080
And the reason is, is because you have people

1214
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:07,080
who are snitching on other people.

1215
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:09,640
Citizens don't trust each other because-

1216
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:11,080
Do we trust each other here?

1217
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:13,600
No, you don't.

1218
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:15,600
I think you could produce a fascist state

1219
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:17,640
or authoritarian state where people trust each other

1220
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:20,600
literally 20 times more than what we have now, sir.

1221
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:21,840
I don't think it's possible.

1222
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:23,920
I think that's very easily done.

1223
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:25,800
You're so naive if you think that.

1224
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:27,680
People don't trust each other now.

1225
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:31,040
People don't trust each other with democracy right now.

1226
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:32,760
People snitch on each other

1227
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:34,520
because they think it's funny in our country.

1228
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:37,320
Because in that kind of country,

1229
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:42,000
some snitching is justified.

1230
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,840
But I don't think there would necessarily be

1231
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:45,600
these authoritarian style laws

1232
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:47,400
where people would be snitching on each other

1233
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:49,440
in a fascist state.

1234
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,240
I just can't imagine.

1235
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:52,240
If it's a fascist state,

1236
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:55,240
how are they gonna produce those sort of things?

1237
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:56,440
You would think that they would be running

1238
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:58,360
a better operation than everybody going around

1239
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:00,920
snitching on each other in these tiny regards.

1240
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:03,040
Well, how do they get the information though?

1241
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:04,680
How do they get the information?

1242
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:07,080
Here, let's say that in fascist America,

1243
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:09,120
let's say I'm living in fascist America, okay?

1244
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:10,920
Your idealized fascist America.

1245
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:13,000
And I'm running some sort of underground group.

1246
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,720
I have like a secret liberal group where we get together

1247
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:17,560
and maybe trade banned liberal books.

1248
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:19,440
And we talk about one day

1249
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:20,960
reinstituting a liberal government.

1250
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:25,600
You would have to have a snitch in my operation

1251
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:27,640
to actually come in and stop me.

1252
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:28,480
Well, sure.

1253
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:30,080
I mean, if it was a fascist state to the degree

1254
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:34,600
where they're banning books and they're like, you know,

1255
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:37,080
but I mean, I think that if the books are really bad,

1256
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:38,560
then they probably should be banned.

1257
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:41,200
So you probably do deserve to be snitched on.

1258
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:42,760
I mean, to your degree,

1259
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:44,480
some snitching is always justified.

1260
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:46,880
Some snitching can be justified.

1261
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:49,280
It depends what we're talking about,

1262
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:52,160
but generally I think the answer to that is no.

1263
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:55,400
Snitching can never be justified?

1264
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:57,160
Not never, but generally.

1265
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:59,800
So for example, I wouldn't snitch on my friend

1266
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,240
if he managed-

1267
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:02,080
You would have better laws where-

1268
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:02,920
Hold on, hold on.

1269
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:03,740
You could have better-

1270
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:04,580
Hold on, hold on.

1271
00:47:04,580 --> 00:47:05,400
Hold on, hold on.

1272
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:06,240
Holy shit.

1273
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,080
No, no, no.

1274
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:07,920
Cause he's not, cause he's not,

1275
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:08,760
everything he says is retarded.

1276
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:09,580
You could have better laws

1277
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:11,480
where less snitching actually transpires

1278
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:13,560
in an authoritarian style country.

1279
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:15,080
Like you're saying,

1280
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:16,520
because the laws could,

1281
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:18,360
the kind of society, the operation-

1282
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:20,880
Anti-snitching laws in a fucking fascist society?

1283
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:24,560
An operation could be run where there is the snitch,

1284
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:27,160
snitching isn't a thing where nobody wants to snitch,

1285
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:28,760
where it doesn't even make sense to snitch.

1286
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:30,320
There is nobody to snitch to.

1287
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:31,160
And-

1288
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:33,640
In an authoritarian government?

1289
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:35,720
So how does the government get the information

1290
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:38,120
that it needs then if no one's snitching?

1291
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:41,560
What's, how do they get the information they need?

1292
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:42,400
Yeah.

1293
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:43,220
What kind of government?

1294
00:47:43,220 --> 00:47:44,700
The authoritarian government?

1295
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:45,760
Yes.

1296
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:46,880
In your idealized government.

1297
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:47,720
Okay.

1298
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:48,680
Your idealized system,

1299
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:49,720
there's no snitching,

1300
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:50,840
but it's a fascist state.

1301
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:51,680
Okay.

1302
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:53,620
How does the fascist state get the information

1303
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:54,800
that it needs from people

1304
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:57,160
if no one's telling them anything?

1305
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:00,680
Well, I mean, obviously they have to talk about something.

1306
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:02,840
Like if somebody breaks a law, man,

1307
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:04,280
then snitching has to happen

1308
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:06,200
no matter what country you're in, right?

1309
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:08,020
You agree with that, right?

1310
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:08,860
Sure.

1311
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:09,920
And here's the thing, like, for example,

1312
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:11,240
I would probably snitch on my friend

1313
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:12,540
if he murdered someone.

1314
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:14,600
But if my friend got away with a speeding ticket,

1315
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:15,800
I wouldn't snitch on him.

1316
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:18,840
If he got away with a speeding ticket,

1317
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:19,680
or what do you mean got away?

1318
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:20,520
As in, if he-

1319
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:22,640
Or ran from the police and got away or something?

1320
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:25,440
Yeah, like if it was like a misdemeanor crime

1321
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:26,320
and he got away with it,

1322
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,600
and there's no danger of him being caught,

1323
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:30,000
I wouldn't tell the cops, no.

1324
00:48:31,860 --> 00:48:33,120
Oh, well, maybe you should then.

1325
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:34,720
If it was a misdemeanor, maybe then.

1326
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:36,600
Yeah, I mean, but that could easily happen

1327
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:37,440
in an authoritarian state.

1328
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:38,260
It depends on the crime, right?

1329
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:39,100
It depends on the crime.

1330
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:40,600
Why do you think, you know,

1331
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:43,760
it could be more unlikely for somebody to snitch

1332
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:46,260
in that exact example in an authoritarian state

1333
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:49,780
because of, it could be more harsher and-

1334
00:48:49,780 --> 00:48:50,620
Go ahead.

1335
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:51,440
I can describe it to you.

1336
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:56,240
So the fundamental issue is that authoritarian states,

1337
00:48:57,120 --> 00:49:01,240
they have to take behavior that is relatively normal

1338
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:02,960
and make it illegal.

1339
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:06,160
And the reason that they have such wide,

1340
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:09,520
like secret police apparatuses,

1341
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:14,520
is because in order to get people to not do normal things,

1342
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:17,640
you have to have some sort of,

1343
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:20,520
well, here, this happened in East Germany.

1344
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:24,820
Well, what kind of normal behavior has to be illegal

1345
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:25,660
in a fascist state?

1346
00:49:25,980 --> 00:49:30,140
Tell me what exact normal, what exact normal behavior.

1347
00:49:30,140 --> 00:49:32,460
Yeah, harboring Jews is a big one.

1348
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:33,700
But here's the thing,

1349
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:35,300
I can give you an example from a communist.

1350
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:36,860
It's normal to harbor Jews.

1351
00:49:36,860 --> 00:49:38,660
It's normal to harbor Jews.

1352
00:49:38,660 --> 00:49:41,420
If they're being exterminated, yes, you should do that.

1353
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:45,660
Let's not go super down this rabbit hole

1354
00:49:45,660 --> 00:49:47,660
because I feel, I have a feeling I'm afraid here.

1355
00:49:47,660 --> 00:49:49,820
You don't think anything could justify their extermination?

1356
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:51,480
Ah, let's be real.

1357
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:52,320
Let's be real.

1358
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:53,300
Let's move past.

1359
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:56,080
Wait, are you talking about?

1360
00:49:57,140 --> 00:49:58,420
Yeah, he's full JQ.

1361
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:02,540
Okay, listen, I can give you an example from East Germany.

1362
00:50:02,540 --> 00:50:05,740
Okay, communist state, just as authoritarian, okay?

1363
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:09,820
So they had to outlaw ownership.

1364
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:13,160
I think they had to outlaw ownership of multiple properties.

1365
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:15,900
So for example, you couldn't own two houses, right?

1366
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:17,720
And what they had to do is like,

1367
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:22,180
well, how can you tell that this house is owned

1368
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:24,940
by somebody else without someone informing, right?

1369
00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:27,620
One of the reasons that East Germany

1370
00:50:27,620 --> 00:50:30,620
had the most extensive secret police in the world

1371
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:32,720
is because they were literally using it

1372
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:35,180
to track people's purchases and discover,

1373
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:38,020
hey, like, are you buying things

1374
00:50:38,020 --> 00:50:41,300
that you shouldn't be buying with your paycheck?

1375
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:43,540
That's extremely authoritarian.

1376
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:46,820
But that sort of authoritarian control of an economy

1377
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:49,740
requires massive amounts of data collection.

1378
00:50:49,740 --> 00:50:51,580
So you have the secret police

1379
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:53,700
and you have informants.

1380
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:55,140
That's why something like in Romania,

1381
00:50:55,140 --> 00:50:57,940
something like one fourth of all citizens

1382
00:50:57,940 --> 00:51:00,860
at one point was a government informant, you know?

1383
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:04,100
These top-down overarching systems

1384
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:07,940
have to have such ridiculous secret police systems.

1385
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:10,260
How many people work for the government in that regard?

1386
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:12,500
Like 25% of people.

1387
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:15,080
Yeah, 25%, one in four.

1388
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:19,260
Yeah, like you're saying two houses in a fascist state

1389
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:21,540
and then somebody snitches, like that's the least of them.

1390
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:24,220
This would be a communist.

1391
00:51:24,220 --> 00:51:26,260
Or authoritarian state, whatever, communist state.

1392
00:51:26,260 --> 00:51:29,300
It's two houses and somebody snitches is like,

1393
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:31,420
that means nothing to me, man.

1394
00:51:31,420 --> 00:51:32,740
True, but here's what it is though,

1395
00:51:32,740 --> 00:51:35,580
is that if you have enough money,

1396
00:51:35,580 --> 00:51:38,220
buying two houses is a pretty normal thing to do.

1397
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:39,180
Who's to say that?

1398
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:43,740
Just let me explain, let me explain this.

1399
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:47,400
So what I was getting at is that authoritarian governments

1400
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:51,020
have to make some normal behaviors illegal.

1401
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:52,820
I disagree with that.

1402
00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:53,980
That's where we disagree.

1403
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:56,260
I don't know where, can you give me an example?

1404
00:51:56,260 --> 00:51:57,580
You're saying harboring Jews,

1405
00:51:57,580 --> 00:51:58,940
but can you give me another example

1406
00:51:58,940 --> 00:52:00,340
because we're on YouTube?

1407
00:52:00,340 --> 00:52:01,860
Okay, so we're not gonna talk about the harboring Jews.

1408
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:04,740
That's your one, like, okay, there's the freebie.

1409
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:07,140
Okay, okay, because of YouTube, because of YouTube.

1410
00:52:07,140 --> 00:52:10,300
Otherwise I would be open to taking that on, but okay.

1411
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:11,140
Okay, okay.

1412
00:52:11,140 --> 00:52:13,920
I disagree, normal behaviors have to be illegal.

1413
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:16,600
I think you're naive to what a fascist state would be.

1414
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:18,300
I think even you-

1415
00:52:18,340 --> 00:52:21,560
Would you make non-heterosexual sex illegal?

1416
00:52:23,860 --> 00:52:26,380
Now you're asking me what my personal ideal is.

1417
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:28,500
Yes, your personal, because you're telling us

1418
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:29,740
what the good is. Your fascist state.

1419
00:52:29,740 --> 00:52:31,300
Yeah, your fascist state.

1420
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:32,920
You're the leader.

1421
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:33,980
We're saying-

1422
00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:36,100
You're the Fuhrer of your own state.

1423
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:37,620
Okay, okay.

1424
00:52:37,620 --> 00:52:41,300
Would you make non-heterosexual sex illegal?

1425
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:43,420
I'm not saying I should be the Fuhrer.

1426
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:46,980
I'm not necessarily, like I said, I'm not necessarily-

1427
00:52:47,020 --> 00:52:51,380
Would your ideal Fuhrer make non-heterosexual sex illegal?

1428
00:52:54,820 --> 00:52:56,900
Non-heterosexual sex illegal.

1429
00:52:56,900 --> 00:52:59,420
I think it's hard to say.

1430
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:04,420
I don't think so, no, I don't think so, no.

1431
00:53:04,420 --> 00:53:07,620
Illegal is one thing,

1432
00:53:07,620 --> 00:53:09,540
but the punishment of a legality

1433
00:53:09,540 --> 00:53:10,860
is a whole other thing, right?

1434
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:14,060
So I think it wouldn't be bad

1435
00:53:14,060 --> 00:53:16,020
if necessarily it was frowned upon.

1436
00:53:16,060 --> 00:53:17,900
I wouldn't necessarily be so much against that,

1437
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:22,240
but illegal is, maybe you could say it's too far,

1438
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:25,600
but maybe there's some punishment is just,

1439
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:27,620
I mean, it depends.

1440
00:53:27,620 --> 00:53:29,820
If it's legal, how can there be punishment?

1441
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:35,740
No, I'm not saying it to be legal.

1442
00:53:35,740 --> 00:53:37,180
I'm saying it can be illegal,

1443
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:38,820
but maybe the punishment isn't,

1444
00:53:38,820 --> 00:53:41,180
you kill the person obviously or something.

1445
00:53:41,180 --> 00:53:43,580
But what's the punishment though?

1446
00:53:44,580 --> 00:53:47,300
I don't know, you have to take classes,

1447
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:49,620
you have to figure out what's going on with you

1448
00:53:49,620 --> 00:53:51,700
that would make you wanna engage

1449
00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:52,660
in that type of behavior.

1450
00:53:52,660 --> 00:53:54,660
I mean, there are ways to mitigate that behavior

1451
00:53:54,660 --> 00:53:56,700
and however that can be best enacted in the law

1452
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:58,420
probably should be.

1453
00:53:58,420 --> 00:54:01,900
Okay, so how would your government discover

1454
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:04,220
if somebody is having gay sex?

1455
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:08,040
I don't know, maybe somebody would inform

1456
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:10,540
somebody else about it, but I'm not saying that-

1457
00:54:10,540 --> 00:54:12,020
So you'd have snitches.

1458
00:54:12,020 --> 00:54:14,860
In regard to the gay sex thing and sexual degeneracy,

1459
00:54:14,860 --> 00:54:17,460
I think that any amount of sexual degeneracy

1460
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:19,820
is gonna be normal to some degree in a society.

1461
00:54:19,820 --> 00:54:22,420
And so, yeah, but if people were snitching,

1462
00:54:22,420 --> 00:54:25,700
I mean, people snitch about bestiality in our society now.

1463
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:27,700
So snitching, you agreed to me earlier,

1464
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:31,240
snitching can be okay, but you don't like snitching

1465
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:33,440
when it conflates with your personal moral views

1466
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:34,820
of the world.

1467
00:54:34,820 --> 00:54:38,060
And so- Yes, but it's the same thing with you though.

1468
00:54:38,060 --> 00:54:42,140
Sir, but sometimes your personal,

1469
00:54:42,140 --> 00:54:43,860
sometimes that snitching is justified

1470
00:54:43,860 --> 00:54:47,040
whether it's your personal view of the world or not.

1471
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:49,500
And so- Okay, if that's the case,

1472
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:52,540
how is snitching on a person having gay sex justified?

1473
00:54:53,780 --> 00:54:56,220
I'm not saying that that necessarily is justified.

1474
00:54:56,220 --> 00:54:59,780
I'm saying that maybe you need to look into that

1475
00:54:59,780 --> 00:55:01,420
to some degree and figure out what's going on

1476
00:55:01,420 --> 00:55:02,260
with the person.

1477
00:55:02,260 --> 00:55:03,660
And if somebody's got a snitch,

1478
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:05,300
again, people snitch about bestiality.

1479
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:08,620
People snitch about homosexuality now to others,

1480
00:55:08,620 --> 00:55:10,700
but it's just not to the legal system.

1481
00:55:10,700 --> 00:55:12,180
They snitch to their friends about it.

1482
00:55:12,180 --> 00:55:14,380
They snitch to whoever, they tell other people,

1483
00:55:14,380 --> 00:55:15,220
I don't know if you consider that,

1484
00:55:15,220 --> 00:55:16,300
I don't know if that's really snitching,

1485
00:55:16,300 --> 00:55:18,900
but they'll, you know, it's just not done

1486
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:19,740
to the government. Not in terms of what

1487
00:55:19,740 --> 00:55:20,580
we're talking about, no, it's a different thing.

1488
00:55:20,580 --> 00:55:21,520
That's a different thing.

1489
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:23,300
In this conversation, we're talking specifically

1490
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:27,020
about how does the government get the accurate information.

1491
00:55:27,020 --> 00:55:28,360
No, no, what I'm talking about,

1492
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:29,580
and I'm talking about how does the government

1493
00:55:29,580 --> 00:55:31,980
get the information necessary to implement its laws?

1494
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:33,440
That's what I'm talking about.

1495
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:37,000
Yeah, and it's the same way that it's done

1496
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,080
in every other country, dude.

1497
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:40,240
That's what my answer is.

1498
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:42,080
It's the same way it's done now,

1499
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:45,580
and I'm telling you it can be done even better, probably.

1500
00:55:45,580 --> 00:55:47,200
I mean, I don't necessarily think,

1501
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:49,000
but I wouldn't necessarily,

1502
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:52,960
like there wouldn't be punishments for homosexuals,

1503
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:56,340
like you would believe, but I think, you know,

1504
00:55:56,340 --> 00:55:58,920
probably snitching to some degree on homosexual behavior

1505
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:00,160
isn't necessarily a bad thing.

1506
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:01,360
Do you think that's bad?

1507
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:03,360
Depends what you mean.

1508
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:06,360
Do you think it's bad if the government knows you're gay?

1509
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:10,480
What if there is no punishment?

1510
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:13,600
If the government does nothing with the information, no.

1511
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:14,420
Okay.

1512
00:56:14,420 --> 00:56:15,260
Because I don't think there's anything wrong

1513
00:56:15,260 --> 00:56:16,100
with being gay.

1514
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:17,960
But hey, you know, at least what this means

1515
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:19,920
is that Nick Fuentes can have his catboys

1516
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:21,080
in your society, right?

1517
00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:23,820
It's a bad, is it a bad thing

1518
00:56:23,820 --> 00:56:26,480
if everybody in the society is gay?

1519
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:28,560
Is it a bad thing if homosexuality

1520
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:31,000
is on the rise in a society?

1521
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:32,360
Answer that question.

1522
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:33,720
Is it a bad, answer that question.

1523
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:36,000
Is it a bad thing if homosexuality-

1524
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,880
I think it can actually reach a point

1525
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:38,720
where it does become bad.

1526
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:40,080
There's too many people who are gay, yeah.

1527
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:42,220
Okay, so then you would even justify snitching

1528
00:56:42,220 --> 00:56:43,360
to some degree.

1529
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:44,680
No, no, because here's the thing,

1530
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:45,520
I wouldn't make it legal.

1531
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:46,800
If there's too many people that are gay

1532
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:48,440
and you're not having enough kids,

1533
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:50,360
everybody's turning gay for some reason

1534
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:53,380
and there's nobody being, no kids being produced,

1535
00:56:53,380 --> 00:56:54,220
then-

1536
00:56:54,220 --> 00:56:55,280
Because there's chemicals in the water, yeah.

1537
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:58,200
It's, snitching is probably justified then to-

1538
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:00,360
Well, hold on, hold on, hold on, because here's the thing.

1539
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:03,400
Even in a society where being gay is on the rise,

1540
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:06,440
I wouldn't make it illegal to be gay.

1541
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:08,720
But what if you, what if it's on the rise

1542
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:11,400
so much that your people are suffering

1543
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:13,960
and living in hell because of it?

1544
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:15,800
How are they suffering and living in hell?

1545
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:19,160
Oh, sir, like you're not gonna answer the question?

1546
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:19,980
Okay, I got it.

1547
00:57:19,980 --> 00:57:20,820
I need to know how they're suffering

1548
00:57:20,820 --> 00:57:23,160
and handling in hell specifically.

1549
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:25,000
Oh, did he actually leave this time?

1550
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:27,820
Oh, shit.

1551
00:57:27,820 --> 00:57:29,440
Earlier it was just because his microphone

1552
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:34,380
was getting cut off, but, well, that was fun.

1553
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:39,600
So you talk to this guy a lot?

1554
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:41,480
I've talked to him a couple of times.

1555
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:46,480
He, he's like this very strange combination

1556
00:57:48,260 --> 00:57:50,680
of like, groiper and socialist

1557
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:55,680
that I've never quite encountered before in my entire life.

1558
00:57:56,680 --> 00:58:01,680
Do you know who Big Papa Fascist Andrew Wilson is?

1559
00:58:02,940 --> 00:58:04,860
Yes, I kinda do, yeah.

1560
00:58:04,860 --> 00:58:08,440
Yeah, he got me to talk to him first,

1561
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:11,180
and then it's just been this ongoing saga

1562
00:58:11,180 --> 00:58:15,500
of every once in a while he'll come through and talk.

1563
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:20,500
But yeah, this whole conversation started out with him

1564
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:25,260
complaining about getting a stalking charge

1565
00:58:25,820 --> 00:58:29,340
that he had to plead guilty to, and now I know.

1566
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:31,300
He's stuck.

1567
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:33,380
Some girl he knew in real life, I guess,

1568
00:58:33,380 --> 00:58:36,620
but like he denied the allegations, obviously.

1569
00:58:36,620 --> 00:58:39,740
But yeah, it's been,

1570
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:45,920
this conversation's been going on

1571
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:48,660
for the longest time between me and him,

1572
00:58:48,660 --> 00:58:51,000
where like, I'll say like, wow, you sound like a lefty.

1573
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,140
Well, maybe not a lefty now.

1574
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:58,300
He doesn't really have a full understanding

1575
00:58:58,300 --> 00:58:59,740
of what his own positions are,

1576
00:58:59,740 --> 00:59:02,180
except for like right now everything is bad

1577
00:59:02,180 --> 00:59:04,220
and it needs to be fixed.

1578
00:59:04,220 --> 00:59:06,900
And because it's all bad right now

1579
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:09,220
and it all needs to be fixed,

1580
00:59:09,220 --> 00:59:14,220
we have to like fix it by tearing everything down,

1581
00:59:14,620 --> 00:59:18,780
which sounds a lot like a lot of the like tankies

1582
00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:21,780
I've talked to, where they know what their end goal is,

1583
00:59:21,780 --> 00:59:24,300
which is some sort of like socialist fucking utopia,

1584
00:59:24,300 --> 00:59:26,180
but like they don't have any plans

1585
00:59:26,180 --> 00:59:27,280
on how to actually get there.

1586
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:29,700
What their plans are are to just like

1587
00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:33,300
destroy the entire system and then we'll go from there.

1588
00:59:33,300 --> 00:59:36,060
It's destroy first, fix everything later,

1589
00:59:36,060 --> 00:59:38,700
instead of just trying to fix what we have,

1590
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:40,000
where we're at, you know?

1591
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:42,060
Yeah, yeah.

1592
00:59:42,060 --> 00:59:45,340
He sounds, to use one of my own terms,

1593
00:59:45,340 --> 00:59:47,180
he sounds very post-fascist

1594
00:59:47,180 --> 00:59:48,900
in a lot of the things he's been saying.

1595
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:51,600
I'm actually like really blown away

1596
00:59:52,360 --> 00:59:53,200
because I watched your video

1597
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:56,040
that you linked to me a while back about fascism,

1598
00:59:56,040 --> 01:00:00,480
but you actually sound like you know

1599
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:02,880
what you're talking about compared to like 90%

1600
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:06,880
of everyone that I've ever talked to about fascism.

1601
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:08,120
That's just an illusion, to be honest.

1602
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:10,080
That's just an illusion.

1603
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:14,000
I mean, you were bringing up all the like scholars and shit,

1604
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,880
so you know more than I do.

1605
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:19,160
Most of everything that I've learned about is all

1606
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:23,960
just watching other people's YouTube videos.

1607
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:27,840
And I guess I've read Giovanni Gentile.

1608
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:29,680
Well, I listened to the audio book.

1609
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:34,320
But yeah, I don't know.

1610
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:36,520
I don't even have any like thoughts afterwards.

1611
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:39,240
Like what do you think about that whole?

1612
01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:40,960
Well, firstly, I just realized

1613
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:43,480
that I advertised going on your stream

1614
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:45,840
as talking to a post-fascist.

1615
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:47,240
So people probably think that you're one.

1616
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:50,800
Oh, yes, I am the fascist that he's talking about.

1617
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:53,280
All right, guys, fuck.

1618
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:59,800
The thing is, I could like recognize a lot of of more

1619
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:02,920
coherent points in what he was talking about,

1620
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:06,160
but he couldn't you couldn't get them out, you know, like.

1621
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:09,320
So there's an essay that Sargon wrote

1622
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:12,720
for his website, that for Lotus Eaters.

1623
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:15,800
And I think it was just, hold on, let me just I want to credit the right guy.

1624
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:17,560
He has like a dozen people working for him right now.

1625
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:24,000
I think it was Sargon.

1626
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:27,840
No, it wasn't Sargon.

1627
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:29,960
It was it was one of the people working for his site.

1628
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:33,040
You know, he doesn't he has like a news outlet now, right?

1629
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:35,240
Like that's his thing is doing the news. Oh, really?

1630
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:38,880
Yep. Lotus Eaters dot com is his news outlet.

1631
01:01:39,560 --> 01:01:40,200
She does that now.

1632
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:41,640
I knew that there was a podcast.

1633
01:01:41,640 --> 01:01:46,040
I've never like my my foray into politics

1634
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:49,800
online came basically after the fall of the like YouTube

1635
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:52,000
skeptics and Sargon and all of those people.

1636
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:55,560
So like, I never really watched any of his stuff from before.

1637
01:01:56,760 --> 01:01:58,040
I was going to really fell.

1638
01:01:58,040 --> 01:02:00,200
He like he he got kicked off Twitter.

1639
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:02,520
Everyone thinks that that's the same thing as dying, but it's not.

1640
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:08,440
And then his channel, he didn't upload there very much for a while, right?

1641
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:12,400
He got like he's actively blacklisted

1642
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:15,440
or sorry, shadow banned on the Sargon like official channel.

1643
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:19,920
So what he did was he got together some people that he knew

1644
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:22,080
and he started a news outlet.

1645
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:25,200
And now he does like a daily podcast over there.

1646
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:27,760
He's kind of abandoned the Sargon name.

1647
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:30,960
No, but someone on his site wrote an article

1648
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:34,000
called The Universal Acid of Liberalism.

1649
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:36,400
OK, and this this also applies to socialism, too.

1650
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:39,760
I think this person used liberalism just to mean the left,

1651
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:42,040
but it applies to liberalism and it applies to socialism.

1652
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:46,120
And the and this is where like the gray sludge is coming from,

1653
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:51,000
because there is an argument to be made that the the left

1654
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,280
tends to universalize everything.

1655
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:56,400
The liberals do this and socialists do this and progressives do this.

1656
01:02:56,600 --> 01:02:57,280
They all do this.

1657
01:02:57,280 --> 01:03:01,280
The idea is like, well, the same framework can be used anywhere

1658
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:05,320
in any time and place with with any people, with any culture, with with anything.

1659
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:07,920
You know, you can have a functioning liberal society anywhere

1660
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:10,440
and cultural differences don't mean anything.

1661
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:13,040
And that leads to a universalization

1662
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:16,000
of a lot of the core tenants of society.

1663
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:21,120
Now, to visualize this, the right wing people will often appeal to architecture.

1664
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:24,920
Right. So British architecture looks different from German architecture,

1665
01:03:25,640 --> 01:03:27,760
which looks different from Chinese architecture.

1666
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:32,320
And then you go to a modern city and it's all the same glass skyscraper.

1667
01:03:32,320 --> 01:03:34,280
And they're like, look, look at what has been lost.

1668
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:37,120
Look at look at the diversity that has been lost when everything

1669
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:41,360
is universalized into into a more left wing way of living.

1670
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:47,120
And I think there's something to that critique that if if the entire world

1671
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:51,920
was actually a socialist utopia, you probably would lose a lot of diversity.

1672
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:55,360
I think like a lot of things that are particular to one location

1673
01:03:55,360 --> 01:03:58,120
or to one language or to one people or to one cultural practice,

1674
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:01,640
you would have to lose all that thing because when things are equal,

1675
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:03,000
they are the same.

1676
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,080
And so you have to lose difference.

1677
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:08,680
But difference is what makes is what makes life fun, you know?

1678
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
Yeah, no. So I think there's something to this point of view.

1679
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:16,320
And so when he talks about the the gray sludge, there is like

1680
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:20,160
I've heard people describe Marvel movies as gray sludge

1681
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:23,960
because they're kind of like a facsimile of a good movie.

1682
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:27,440
Yeah, they hit all the beats, but there's no reason for the beats to even happen.

1683
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:29,160
Like there's no artistry there.

1684
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:33,320
So it feels like a lot of of at least

1685
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:37,280
cultural leftism is just kind of like manufactured and fake.

1686
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:38,760
You know what I mean?

1687
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:41,720
Yeah, I I don't disagree with that. I feel like.

1688
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:49,080
Sorry, I don't have my ADD medicine, so I want to like try my best.

1689
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:52,320
So I haven't I've been I've been without Vyvanse for way too long.

1690
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:56,280
So I I feel like there's

1691
01:04:56,840 --> 01:04:59,920
this like general feeling

1692
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:03,920
of lack of purpose that brings people to

1693
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:07,560
certain to these like more extreme positions.

1694
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:09,640
And this isn't a hot take. Everybody thinks this right.

1695
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:12,240
But yeah, I feel like the.

1696
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:16,960
The two paths you can go down, right,

1697
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:20,640
like either becoming like an ultra fucking socialist

1698
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:25,520
or an ultra fucking fascist is really depressing and it's extra depressing.

1699
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:30,680
When. The person doesn't even have that

1700
01:05:31,120 --> 01:05:35,360
that full worldview because you can't even attack their worldview

1701
01:05:35,360 --> 01:05:36,680
because it's nonexistent.

1702
01:05:36,680 --> 01:05:38,760
That's what the deal is with this guy.

1703
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:44,480
I can't attack his like positions on like fascism or

1704
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:48,640
or socialism because he doesn't believe in either necessarily.

1705
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:52,080
He just believes, well, this is more fascist than socialist.

1706
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:55,360
He just believes in like by whatever means necessary. Right.

1707
01:05:55,600 --> 01:05:59,560
So he could he's like a very strict consequentialist. Yeah.

1708
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:03,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And.

1709
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:06,360
Oh, fuck me. Sorry, playing Minesweeper two.

1710
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:12,040
So like, it's really hard having conversations with him about politics,

1711
01:06:12,040 --> 01:06:14,960
even though like it's very fun and he gets like ultra like

1712
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:18,840
upsetty spaghetti about things, obviously, but it's like

1713
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:24,080
I don't even know where to begin because like I've done my own research into

1714
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:27,800
into fascism so that I can push back against fascists.

1715
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:32,320
I used to be a socialist, so I can push back against socialist shit a lot.

1716
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:35,440
But goddamn, when I can't

1717
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:41,040
pinpoint exactly like how to start attacking someone's

1718
01:06:42,120 --> 01:06:46,040
like worldview, I don't know how we can like move forward in the conversation,

1719
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:48,160
because like again, he says like Grace Ludge, right?

1720
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:51,840
Like at first it was literal, like they're feeding us Grace Ludge. Right.

1721
01:06:52,040 --> 01:06:54,640
And then it moves to McDonald's. Yeah.

1722
01:06:54,680 --> 01:06:58,560
Yeah. And then it moves to like, no, I mean, metaphorical Grace Ludge.

1723
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:00,640
OK, well, let's talk about the metaphorical Grace Ludge.

1724
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:04,280
And there's no actual position there to attack

1725
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:06,960
because he just doesn't like what's going on now.

1726
01:07:07,240 --> 01:07:10,400
What's going on now is the problem. Right. Yeah.

1727
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:14,280
Yeah. So I think part of it, well, actually, first of all, before we

1728
01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:17,440
even write this down so I don't lose it, we get into that.

1729
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:21,360
Did you say that you disagreed with with the universalization take that I gave?

1730
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:25,320
No, I don't necessarily disagree with that.

1731
01:07:25,320 --> 01:07:26,840
OK. All right.

1732
01:07:26,840 --> 01:07:30,640
So the universalization in terms of like people being

1733
01:07:32,320 --> 01:07:35,960
like the the Marvel movies, like it's like the Grace Ludge, like nothing is

1734
01:07:36,560 --> 01:07:40,480
like we don't have like individual like areas that have their own unique culture,

1735
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:45,320
like like yeah, yeah, unique cuisines, dialects, et cetera.

1736
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:48,880
And the worst part about that is that that kind of leads to,

1737
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:50,720
you know, more ethno state thinking,

1738
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:52,720
which can obviously go down a different rabbit hole.

1739
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:56,400
But you also just can't have every everything and everyone

1740
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:59,600
and everywhere be the same and everything operates into the same system.

1741
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:01,440
Everyone thinks the same way.

1742
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:03,080
That's not going to work either. Right.

1743
01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:05,240
There has to be some there has to be some difference

1744
01:08:05,240 --> 01:08:08,800
between different places and different different people, you know.

1745
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:13,520
There's there's a there's a proper there's a proper balance

1746
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:18,000
to be struck here between like complete exclusion and exclusivity.

1747
01:08:18,200 --> 01:08:21,400
And everyone kind of siloed off into their own bunkers

1748
01:08:21,400 --> 01:08:22,840
where they don't interact with each other.

1749
01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:27,200
And also everything being mixed together into one giant pot

1750
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:29,160
where nothing even stands out anymore.

1751
01:08:29,160 --> 01:08:30,840
There's some there's some middle ground

1752
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:33,160
we can reach here between those two positions.

1753
01:08:33,160 --> 01:08:38,120
Yeah, I feel like there's a lot of like like nerd culture things

1754
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:42,440
that I used to enjoy because there was like a certain level of exclusivity.

1755
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:44,320
Like there was like its own culture.

1756
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:46,760
Like I used to like when I was in high school,

1757
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:49,880
Warhammer 40K and D&D are like the two things that I've seen,

1758
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:51,400
like a massive shift in culture.

1759
01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:55,680
And I feel like they've lost something because they've tried to universalize

1760
01:08:55,680 --> 01:08:58,720
the experience so that everybody can enjoy it. Right.

1761
01:08:59,480 --> 01:09:01,760
Yeah. So like Warhammer is for everyone.

1762
01:09:01,960 --> 01:09:03,600
You've heard that a few times. Yeah.

1763
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:05,720
And I've argued. Well, no, it's not. It's actually not.

1764
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:09,000
Yeah, it really isn't like look at the fucking price point.

1765
01:09:09,160 --> 01:09:16,080
But like the they're like one of the jokes in like D&D circles

1766
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:19,960
that you used to see were like the you know, someone would invite their girlfriend

1767
01:09:19,960 --> 01:09:23,760
and she wanted to be like, you know, a fucking vampire and a werewolf

1768
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:26,320
and a fucking fairy and like

1769
01:09:28,120 --> 01:09:30,920
it like technically it's possible. Right.

1770
01:09:31,720 --> 01:09:35,000
And so like the people who like, I guess like what you're saying,

1771
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,440
like the universalization of all these things, people would say,

1772
01:09:37,560 --> 01:09:40,520
well, it's it's technically like possible to happen in the game.

1773
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:42,240
So there's nothing wrong with with that.

1774
01:09:42,240 --> 01:09:45,120
But it's like, OK, but it's kind of taking away some parts of the game

1775
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:49,080
for like other people if like they can't if we have to like

1776
01:09:49,320 --> 01:09:53,400
find like all these esoteric rules to make this like very hyper specific thing happen

1777
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:56,280
or in like Warhammer 40K like you like see people

1778
01:09:57,160 --> 01:10:02,160
like they've kind of taken the edge of the like actual like fucked up shit

1779
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:05,240
that the entire setting is based off of. Right.

1780
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:10,200
You kind of like push that to the background,

1781
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:12,600
like they're not trying to like explicitly get rid of it,

1782
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:16,600
but like kind of implicitly because like the there's like the huge push

1783
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:18,840
for like female space Marines and all that stuff.

1784
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:21,240
And, you know, like they,

1785
01:10:21,240 --> 01:10:26,920
you know, like all the Xeno like xenophobia, like literal xenophobia,

1786
01:10:26,920 --> 01:10:31,120
fear of like aliens and anything outside of the Imperium, like where like

1787
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:34,520
it feels like they're trying to like pull back into like a.

1788
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:39,440
Technically, like more

1789
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:43,880
original Warhammer 40K aesthetic where they were like trading with aliens

1790
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:48,080
a little bit, but then they kind of moved into like the extra grim, dark shit.

1791
01:10:49,560 --> 01:10:51,920
So like they're trying to like bring in like the like

1792
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:54,880
maybe not all of the mutants are bad and, you know.

1793
01:10:55,080 --> 01:10:58,080
So I understand what you're talking about with that.

1794
01:10:58,080 --> 01:11:00,280
That's my my spiel on that.

1795
01:11:00,280 --> 01:11:02,440
80 D minded. Right. Right.

1796
01:11:02,440 --> 01:11:03,640
No, I get it.

1797
01:11:03,640 --> 01:11:07,560
There's like people there with Dark Souls, right? Mm hmm.

1798
01:11:07,880 --> 01:11:09,720
We got to make Dark Souls more accessible.

1799
01:11:09,720 --> 01:11:10,920
And it's like, well, actually, no, you don't,

1800
01:11:10,920 --> 01:11:13,600
because the whole point of it is to be hard and inaccessible.

1801
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:17,360
And that's like if you if you make Dark Souls, but easy, what do you have?

1802
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:19,880
Right. Like a pretty generic game, you know, like

1803
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:24,680
inclusivity is not always a good thing.

1804
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:27,680
It can often be a good thing, but it's not always a good thing.

1805
01:11:27,680 --> 01:11:30,960
And I think that's something that the left has to has to grapple with

1806
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:33,800
because they think it's it's always good all the time to get more people

1807
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:35,960
included and involved. And it's like, well, not necessarily.

1808
01:11:36,240 --> 01:11:37,720
Sometimes you have to gatekeep.

1809
01:11:37,720 --> 01:11:40,240
Sometimes gatekeeping is good, you know?

1810
01:11:40,240 --> 01:11:41,840
Yeah, for sure.

1811
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:44,640
In terms of the gray sludge as food

1812
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:48,280
conversation, that's like the bugs.

1813
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:49,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1814
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:51,280
Well, to be fair, I've had bugs. I don't like them.

1815
01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:53,720
I'm not going to ever actually eat the bugs.

1816
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:58,440
But like, there's this idea, especially in right wing spaces,

1817
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:01,000
that things have become too easy.

1818
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:03,920
You know, that that science and technological advancement

1819
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:05,280
have made things too easy.

1820
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:07,000
So he brought up fast food.

1821
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,040
And the problem with fast food

1822
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:12,200
is not just that you get fat and unhealthy while you eat it.

1823
01:12:12,240 --> 01:12:14,320
That's a pretty big problem, but it's not the only problem.

1824
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:19,120
Another big problem with it is that it makes getting food too easy.

1825
01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:21,160
You know, people are too divorced

1826
01:12:21,160 --> 01:12:24,400
from the actual labor that creates the food and it makes them kind of feel

1827
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:27,920
there. You know, there's like this there's this view

1828
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:30,960
on the right of the liberal elite or the leftist elite, right?

1829
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:33,400
The people who are

1830
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:36,280
like kind of hypocritically very far left.

1831
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:40,440
Therefore, they're very in favor of these of these redistribution schemes

1832
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:42,040
or they want overt socialism.

1833
01:12:42,040 --> 01:12:45,560
But at the same time, they're also the elite that would be destroyed

1834
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:47,040
by their own policies.

1835
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:49,600
And the right kind of views them as this way. Well.

1836
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:55,720
The right considers the reason that that that that that hypocrisy exists

1837
01:12:55,720 --> 01:13:00,520
to the right is because they've become so divorced

1838
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:03,320
from the labor that actually keeps them around.

1839
01:13:03,560 --> 01:13:07,040
So you have like a modern society, you have specialization of labor.

1840
01:13:07,320 --> 01:13:10,960
So people, you know, I don't have to go out and grow my own food anymore.

1841
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:15,320
I can do a very niche job and get very, very good at one specific thing

1842
01:13:15,320 --> 01:13:17,440
because somebody else's is growing more food.

1843
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:22,600
Have you seen that graph where it showed the percentage of a country's workforce

1844
01:13:23,200 --> 01:13:25,000
in agriculture over time?

1845
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,480
It's a very famous graph. Have you seen that?

1846
01:13:27,480 --> 01:13:29,800
It describes what now?

1847
01:13:29,800 --> 01:13:33,600
Killing percentage of people

1848
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:36,840
in agriculture over time, as they can find it.

1849
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:39,560
It's a very famous.

1850
01:13:39,560 --> 01:13:41,840
Like stark graft, is it here?

1851
01:13:44,120 --> 01:13:46,440
OK, here.

1852
01:13:46,440 --> 01:13:49,280
This is from our world and data, and I'll post this.

1853
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:51,120
So check this out.

1854
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:55,240
What you see. Is as.

1855
01:13:55,240 --> 01:13:59,920
Um. Basically, as countries modernize,

1856
01:14:00,280 --> 01:14:03,680
the number of people working in agriculture drops drastically

1857
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:07,040
because you have fertilizer and you have you have farming equipment

1858
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:11,600
and you have you have all these you have you have basically the infrastructure

1859
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:15,400
to support less people growing way more food and also transporting it

1860
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:19,320
around a whole bunch of factors and refrigeration and all that shit. Yeah.

1861
01:14:20,200 --> 01:14:24,200
Yeah. So basically what this means is you have you have an entire labor force

1862
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:25,760
that isn't growing food anymore.

1863
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:29,000
It's not involved in producing food in any way so they can specialize

1864
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:32,240
so they can specialize in becoming whatever, you know.

1865
01:14:32,440 --> 01:14:35,280
And as soon as we had more advanced machines, we have more specializations.

1866
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:38,280
That's why you have people being YouTubers now, the most useless job.

1867
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:42,560
And yet I can make a living off of it because the essentials

1868
01:14:42,760 --> 01:14:46,920
in the workforce have been covered so efficiently that we can

1869
01:14:47,320 --> 01:14:50,280
people can just do almost whatever they want compared to 500 years ago.

1870
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:53,240
You know, it's kind of it's insane how far we've come.

1871
01:14:53,720 --> 01:14:56,040
However, what this leads to is

1872
01:14:56,720 --> 01:15:00,880
a complete lack of knowledge or a lack of a lack of knowledge.

1873
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:04,160
So, for example, like, have you heard this is a very common story.

1874
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:09,000
You hear like the extremely intelligent university math professor

1875
01:15:09,480 --> 01:15:11,800
who says you don't need to hunt.

1876
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:12,880
Why does anyone still hunt?

1877
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:14,880
Just go buy your meat from the grocery store.

1878
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:16,240
Why are we still killing animals?

1879
01:15:16,240 --> 01:15:18,160
It doesn't make any sense. Just get it from the store.

1880
01:15:18,160 --> 01:15:19,600
You hear that a lot, right? Yeah.

1881
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:23,040
And it's that actually people do actually say that it's because they're so

1882
01:15:23,080 --> 01:15:25,320
specialized in one domain.

1883
01:15:25,960 --> 01:15:28,200
They have no clue where their food comes from. Right.

1884
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:33,080
And so this kind of this being so divorced

1885
01:15:33,080 --> 01:15:37,160
from what keeps the underpinnings of what keeps society running

1886
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:42,080
leads to the right wing thinks leads to a sort of liberal elite

1887
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:45,480
class of people who are very domesticated.

1888
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:49,880
They're very they're unable to really like do physical labor

1889
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:52,000
for themselves, keep themselves alive if they had to.

1890
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,600
And some in some sort of post-apocalyptic scenario.

1891
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:57,880
But they're very specialized in one like technical skill. Right.

1892
01:15:57,960 --> 01:16:01,720
Yeah. And we've like that has always existed in some way, shape or form,

1893
01:16:01,720 --> 01:16:03,760
as long as we've had like cities and stuff.

1894
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:05,640
But it's more and more pronounced.

1895
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:09,280
The more industrialized we get, the more people can specialize

1896
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:11,880
into like very, very hyper specific fields.

1897
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:15,240
And so like the perception is that like we've become

1898
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:19,040
a very weak society for sure. Yeah.

1899
01:16:19,400 --> 01:16:22,960
And so there's like I think it was Kierkegaard.

1900
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:24,600
Kierkegaard said something like,

1901
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:27,320
my job is to make everything worse for people,

1902
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,200
which is a pretty extreme statement.

1903
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:36,640
His entire like outlook on life is just like the like everything sucks.

1904
01:16:36,680 --> 01:16:39,320
My life sucks and I'm going to be very sad about it. Right.

1905
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:40,880
Kind of. Yeah.

1906
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:44,600
But but his point of view was that he believed we would reach a point

1907
01:16:44,840 --> 01:16:47,320
in our scientific development

1908
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:49,600
that things would get too easy.

1909
01:16:49,880 --> 01:16:54,240
And in fact, it would be we would have a better time if things were harder.

1910
01:16:54,680 --> 01:17:00,040
And I think right wingers view that the modern era as being that tipping point.

1911
01:17:00,240 --> 01:17:03,400
And that's why a lot of them talk about fast food, because you can get people.

1912
01:17:04,360 --> 01:17:07,160
Who because people are, you know, they're dumb and they're weak

1913
01:17:07,160 --> 01:17:10,440
and they have shitty morals and they're not able to do what's right all the time.

1914
01:17:10,680 --> 01:17:13,120
So they're going to go get fast food whenever they're

1915
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:15,600
whenever their willpower, you know, wanes.

1916
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:18,080
They're going to take the path of least resistance

1917
01:17:18,280 --> 01:17:22,640
and they're going to literally eat slop because it's cheap and it's plentiful.

1918
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:26,920
And like what kind of person is capable of not doing that?

1919
01:17:27,240 --> 01:17:30,240
Well, it does actually seem to be a reasonably special kind of person.

1920
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:34,200
So there is almost like a a natural hierarchy

1921
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:38,080
between people who have more willpower and people who have less willpower.

1922
01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:42,080
And a lot of a lot of the current right wing paradigm relies on this point of view

1923
01:17:42,080 --> 01:17:45,280
that society is has made things too easy.

1924
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:47,760
And it's created a bunch of soft people.

1925
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:50,320
And that kind of actually bears out in some of the data.

1926
01:17:50,360 --> 01:17:53,000
Yeah, it's probably not as harsh as they think, but there's something to it.

1927
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,840
But I would also say that like a lot of people on the right, like they

1928
01:17:56,520 --> 01:17:58,320
this is something I said earlier, right?

1929
01:17:58,320 --> 01:18:03,240
Where they the right, especially like 2010 to 2019,

1930
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:06,520
like their whole thing was like, I'm not going to be made a victim.

1931
01:18:06,680 --> 01:18:08,080
I'm not a victim of the system.

1932
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:11,120
I picked myself up by the bootstraps, you know, like their entire thing

1933
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:13,640
was like not being the fucking snowflake.

1934
01:18:13,640 --> 01:18:17,280
And I got about like four or four posts

1935
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:20,280
into the Twitter files before he called me. But it.

1936
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:23,880
But like my perception of the Twitter files,

1937
01:18:23,880 --> 01:18:26,520
and again, I haven't read very much of them at all.

1938
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:30,800
I read the full first one when it was being released one sentence

1939
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:33,160
at a fucking time and I didn't read any of the rest of them yet.

1940
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:38,680
But like their their whole thing was like, well, now like

1941
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:42,360
conservatives are seeing themselves like as the victim and like

1942
01:18:42,680 --> 01:18:43,840
rallying behind that.

1943
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:47,960
I would say that like everybody everybody sees themselves as a victim,

1944
01:18:48,760 --> 01:18:51,880
but they the the people that they're saying

1945
01:18:51,880 --> 01:18:55,080
are like victimizing them are like very different.

1946
01:18:55,280 --> 01:18:59,400
And so they see themselves as being better as the other victims.

1947
01:18:59,880 --> 01:19:02,240
You know, does that make sense?

1948
01:19:02,240 --> 01:19:04,720
Yeah. Yeah. A lot of people tend to

1949
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:07,320
this almost seems almost like a universal thing.

1950
01:19:07,320 --> 01:19:08,960
I'm not sure if it is, but it seems very common.

1951
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:12,720
At least people tend to derive some sort of moral justification

1952
01:19:12,720 --> 01:19:13,760
from being a victim.

1953
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:19,280
You know, if you if you go to like an like a very rigidly Islamic society,

1954
01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:22,840
you know, like I'm not talking like like your average state in the Middle East.

1955
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:23,600
I mean, like ISIS.

1956
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:26,680
I go to go to go to an ISIS controlled area if they still controlled locations.

1957
01:19:26,680 --> 01:19:28,920
Right. And you talk to them about what's going on.

1958
01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:32,360
They would often appeal to the fact that the West has victimized them

1959
01:19:32,360 --> 01:19:35,760
and therefore they are justified in, you know, implementing Sharia law.

1960
01:19:35,960 --> 01:19:37,400
They'll they'll have other.

1961
01:19:37,400 --> 01:19:41,960
They do that in China as well with the whole like opium wars and shit like that.

1962
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:44,400
You know, we have been victimized.

1963
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:48,480
Therefore, we can now, you know, push forward our ideas.

1964
01:19:48,720 --> 01:19:50,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1965
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:56,400
So I think there's because people I think I think this is actually

1966
01:19:56,400 --> 01:20:00,400
this might even just be a a human thing, like a naturalistic thing,

1967
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:03,360
because people, you know, have have compassion.

1968
01:20:03,720 --> 01:20:04,880
They have pity.

1969
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:09,280
I think there's definitely just a sense that if you can be a victim,

1970
01:20:09,280 --> 01:20:12,240
that gets you political power and the left does it, the right does it.

1971
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:14,280
Everyone does it, you know?

1972
01:20:14,280 --> 01:20:16,400
Yeah, no, I think that everybody does it.

1973
01:20:16,600 --> 01:20:18,640
And that's something that like

1974
01:20:18,640 --> 01:20:22,760
I was trying to explain to him that like before he jumped in, like when

1975
01:20:22,920 --> 01:20:25,680
like I'm starting to get more into like real world politics,

1976
01:20:25,680 --> 01:20:28,560
especially as I like get further into my degree, political science.

1977
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:31,120
Right. As I heard, I heard you talk about Georgia.

1978
01:20:31,280 --> 01:20:32,320
Did you join?

1979
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:34,760
Did you go with destiny down to that?

1980
01:20:34,760 --> 01:20:37,320
By the time I actually decided I was going to go, they said,

1981
01:20:37,320 --> 01:20:39,880
like, please, no more people. We have too many people.

1982
01:20:39,880 --> 01:20:44,560
So there was a splinter like DGG group that was helping in Augusta.

1983
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:47,120
And so I was there. So, yeah.

1984
01:20:49,560 --> 01:20:53,400
I was trying to explain to him, like, if you if you like want to

1985
01:20:53,400 --> 01:20:57,120
like do something like you can, there are things that you can do, right?

1986
01:20:57,120 --> 01:21:02,200
Like stop like sitting here in like boo hooing about how like mean the world is.

1987
01:21:02,440 --> 01:21:07,760
Right. How bad the the society that you live in is and actually like go and try

1988
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:11,600
and, you know, advocate for like your hyper specific,

1989
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:15,480
you know, like whatever policy that you think is like the most important to pass.

1990
01:21:15,480 --> 01:21:19,200
Right. But more and more, especially as like

1991
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:22,800
people get like these grand narratives around politics

1992
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:26,440
and as they like see the world around them in like a very specific way,

1993
01:21:26,480 --> 01:21:28,680
depending on who they're watching, like

1994
01:21:28,680 --> 01:21:32,880
Vaush viewers are fucking like super far lefties, people who are watching infrared.

1995
01:21:33,080 --> 01:21:35,720
They just feel like you have to tear down the whole fucking system.

1996
01:21:35,960 --> 01:21:39,840
Well, maybe not Vaush viewers like Vaush is at least smart enough to say

1997
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:42,280
like we can like go incrementally.

1998
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:46,160
Although I don't know why I watched that.

1999
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:49,640
I watched that Vaush versus Rose Wriste from a few months ago,

2000
01:21:49,640 --> 01:21:53,200
and he was like straight up like, nope, it's time for a revolution.

2001
01:21:53,640 --> 01:21:57,440
Democracy has failed boys about like shooting conservatives out of the windows.

2002
01:21:57,440 --> 01:21:59,200
But I don't know, like

2003
01:21:59,400 --> 01:22:03,640
I haven't watched him since like, fuck, beginning of 2021.

2004
01:22:04,200 --> 01:22:10,000
But like at least back then, he was more like incrementalist

2005
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:13,080
and like violence when like.

2006
01:22:14,040 --> 01:22:17,480
Absolutely necessary, or like when there's going to be some sort of,

2007
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:23,160
you know, takeover of the government from a socialist revolution or in self-defense.

2008
01:22:23,200 --> 01:22:27,200
Now, he would make the argument that the trans genocide is going on right now

2009
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:30,000
is like self-defense to start like doming

2010
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:33,280
all the fucking Republicans that are in your in your vicinity.

2011
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:37,400
But like stop being that fucking victim

2012
01:22:37,400 --> 01:22:40,920
and stop crying and whining about how the entire system needs to be brought down.

2013
01:22:41,080 --> 01:22:45,720
Look at what the situation actually is instead of like the grand narratives

2014
01:22:45,720 --> 01:22:49,640
about like the fucking Jews owning the fucking like means of production

2015
01:22:49,640 --> 01:22:52,880
and the fucking banking system and like pushing down white people

2016
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,920
or stop looking at the world as if like there are like three people

2017
01:22:55,920 --> 01:23:00,080
who are like a shadowy cabal, like meeting in their like pedophile sex

2018
01:23:00,080 --> 01:23:03,560
dungeons to figure out what like a horrible piece of legislation

2019
01:23:03,560 --> 01:23:07,720
they're going to do to ruin poor people's lives and like actually go out there

2020
01:23:07,720 --> 01:23:12,280
and like do something and like advocate for some sort of like policy or some shit.

2021
01:23:12,280 --> 01:23:15,200
Right. But they don't want to hear that.

2022
01:23:15,200 --> 01:23:19,200
They don't want to hear like do something that is an actual solution to a problem.

2023
01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:22,680
They want to tear down literally everything and.

2024
01:23:23,680 --> 01:23:26,440
You know, like whatever happens afterwards,

2025
01:23:26,440 --> 01:23:28,640
that's when we'll start dealing with it, you know?

2026
01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:34,880
Yeah, a lot of them are taking the anti-democracy pill just because

2027
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:40,480
and I do mean this simply and only because their ideas aren't popular.

2028
01:23:41,400 --> 01:23:45,240
Like if any of this shit on either side was actually popular,

2029
01:23:45,240 --> 01:23:47,160
it would win elections and it doesn't.

2030
01:23:47,160 --> 01:23:48,480
It's as simple as that.

2031
01:23:48,480 --> 01:23:49,840
It's not a failure of democracy.

2032
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:51,560
It's not the system rigged against you.

2033
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:54,200
You know, it's no one is stuffing the ballot boxes.

2034
01:23:54,520 --> 01:23:58,000
You know, it's not like it's not like judges are are somehow biased against you.

2035
01:23:58,000 --> 01:23:59,800
It's that no one likes your ideas.

2036
01:23:59,800 --> 01:24:01,760
Yeah, exactly. That's what I told him.

2037
01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:04,920
Like nobody wants to live in this fucking fascist, fascist,

2038
01:24:04,920 --> 01:24:07,800
theocratic fucking world where like

2039
01:24:08,920 --> 01:24:11,440
you have no choices about like what you're able to do.

2040
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:14,080
Like look at all the things that liberalization has gotten us.

2041
01:24:14,080 --> 01:24:17,560
Like we have like cheaper consumer goods, cheaper electronics.

2042
01:24:17,560 --> 01:24:20,520
You can buy cars a lot cheaper, although maybe not in the past two years

2043
01:24:20,520 --> 01:24:22,320
because of supply chain shit.

2044
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:23,960
Right. Like cars are cheaper.

2045
01:24:23,960 --> 01:24:25,000
Housing is not cheaper.

2046
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:26,360
That is a failure of democracy.

2047
01:24:26,360 --> 01:24:28,600
And I was I was like, holy shit.

2048
01:24:28,720 --> 01:24:32,320
Yeah, it Dev knows way more about this shit than me

2049
01:24:32,320 --> 01:24:36,320
because I probably wouldn't have like thought to like bring up the

2050
01:24:36,840 --> 01:24:41,240
the failures of democracy to like explain how our system is still working

2051
01:24:41,440 --> 01:24:43,320
as intended. Right.

2052
01:24:43,320 --> 01:24:46,440
But like the the whole like.

2053
01:24:47,320 --> 01:24:50,640
The whole thing that like they.

2054
01:24:52,040 --> 01:24:55,600
They ignore all of the good that liberalization has gotten us. Right.

2055
01:24:55,760 --> 01:24:59,320
And they just want to like, yeah, imagine what like a utopia

2056
01:24:59,320 --> 01:25:05,000
would be under their hyper specific, you know, niche political ideal is.

2057
01:25:05,280 --> 01:25:07,960
Right. And it's really fucking blackpilling to me because.

2058
01:25:10,120 --> 01:25:11,840
I feel like.

2059
01:25:12,360 --> 01:25:14,880
I I tried to.

2060
01:25:14,920 --> 01:25:18,320
If I'm being like completely honest, I think I tried to force myself

2061
01:25:18,320 --> 01:25:23,000
to be a socialist when I've always been a like hyper liberal. Right.

2062
01:25:23,200 --> 01:25:25,760
Like, I've always believed that people should have like the right to own guns.

2063
01:25:25,920 --> 01:25:27,760
I've always believed that people should have the right to like

2064
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:29,640
open up a business if they fucking want to.

2065
01:25:29,640 --> 01:25:32,880
Well, you know, I but like the.

2066
01:25:34,640 --> 01:25:38,240
Nicer talking points of socialism, where like everyone has the

2067
01:25:38,360 --> 01:25:43,360
the means to like live a good and happy life, you know, the you know,

2068
01:25:43,360 --> 01:25:48,480
like maybe we could like take care of utilities for people and like nationalize

2069
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:52,920
those like the like soft socialism things are the things that kind of won me over.

2070
01:25:52,920 --> 01:25:55,320
And then, you know, as I learned about actual economics,

2071
01:25:55,320 --> 01:25:59,760
then I moved back over to where I was in high school. Yeah. Yeah. Like.

2072
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:04,080
I kind of lost where I was going with that,

2073
01:26:04,080 --> 01:26:09,680
but like the overarching thing is like the the the liberalization of the world,

2074
01:26:09,680 --> 01:26:13,000
especially in the West, has gotten so much good shit.

2075
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:17,960
It's just like I wouldn't have been able to afford the fucking computer that I have

2076
01:26:17,960 --> 01:26:23,360
right now if it wasn't for like, you know, globalized fucking trade,

2077
01:26:23,360 --> 01:26:27,600
being able to, you know, like Taiwan making the fucking computer chips

2078
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:32,760
and they're mining the lithium and fucking what, Bolivia or whatever the fuck.

2079
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:37,360
Like if that wasn't happening, then this computer would cost like four hundred

2080
01:26:37,360 --> 01:26:41,240
thousand dollars, right, because they would have to like source

2081
01:26:41,240 --> 01:26:43,920
like the three percent of the world's

2082
01:26:43,920 --> 01:26:48,880
lithium out of like four countries that still do trade with us. So, yeah.

2083
01:26:50,640 --> 01:26:51,520
No, I know what you mean.

2084
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:56,240
I mean, Lord Tennyson's pipe in the chat, he says just because goods are cheaper

2085
01:26:56,240 --> 01:26:58,880
doesn't mean that we are living better, more meaningful lives.

2086
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:02,080
A meaningless life is an unfree one because we're trapped with our desires.

2087
01:27:02,360 --> 01:27:03,440
There's some truth to that, right?

2088
01:27:03,440 --> 01:27:07,120
Like liberalism has unleashed this incredible productive power

2089
01:27:07,680 --> 01:27:10,160
and socialism would just destroy it.

2090
01:27:11,240 --> 01:27:14,960
But the issues that we're facing now, they aren't productive in nature.

2091
01:27:15,320 --> 01:27:17,880
And, you know, more capitalism won't won't fix it.

2092
01:27:18,040 --> 01:27:20,360
Socialism won't fix it either. Socialism will make it worse.

2093
01:27:20,640 --> 01:27:22,680
We're facing a different problem now.

2094
01:27:22,680 --> 01:27:26,360
But it's a problem that I don't think people on the left have any solution for.

2095
01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:29,720
Because now we're talking about metaphysics, right?

2096
01:27:29,720 --> 01:27:31,120
We're talking about meaning.

2097
01:27:31,120 --> 01:27:35,360
And this is a materialist analysis can't get you to the solution of this problem.

2098
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:39,440
Right. If you're just focusing on, well, oh, number goes up, paycheck goes up.

2099
01:27:39,440 --> 01:27:42,840
More stuff. Everyone has has has better quality of living.

2100
01:27:42,840 --> 01:27:44,920
Well, it's like, OK, that's good.

2101
01:27:44,920 --> 01:27:48,120
It's not nothing, but it doesn't bring meaning.

2102
01:27:48,160 --> 01:27:49,320
Yeah, it doesn't get you.

2103
01:27:49,320 --> 01:27:52,320
It doesn't get you like the happiness of like hanging out with your friends

2104
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:55,320
and having like those experiences with them or like meeting someone

2105
01:27:55,320 --> 01:27:56,480
and like settling down

2106
01:27:56,480 --> 01:27:58,720
and having like a life with them if that's what you choose. Right.

2107
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:00,600
It doesn't get you that sort of thing.

2108
01:28:00,600 --> 01:28:03,760
But it certainly makes a lot of those things like easier

2109
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:05,800
if you're able to afford to go out with your friends.

2110
01:28:05,800 --> 01:28:09,160
But I think that like the biggest thing

2111
01:28:09,160 --> 01:28:13,640
that is like lost us meaning is like how interconnected we are like.

2112
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:16,240
And that's ironic coming from someone that likes to stream

2113
01:28:16,240 --> 01:28:19,480
and like post YouTube videos and argue with people about politics. Right.

2114
01:28:19,480 --> 01:28:22,320
And I'm talking to people from Australia and fucking.

2115
01:28:22,480 --> 01:28:26,720
I'm talking to you over fucking discord on in Canada and fucking like, you know,

2116
01:28:26,720 --> 01:28:30,880
like the hyper interconnectivity of everyone kind of

2117
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:35,040
expands our social circles to such a degree

2118
01:28:35,200 --> 01:28:38,000
that we don't have like the like more personal

2119
01:28:39,320 --> 01:28:41,200
relationships in our everyday lives.

2120
01:28:41,200 --> 01:28:43,880
I think that so many people are lacking right now.

2121
01:28:44,080 --> 01:28:47,800
And I've like with that guy, I've talked to him like multiple times about this.

2122
01:28:47,920 --> 01:28:51,920
Like, hey, like, do you have friends in real life that you talk to

2123
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:55,480
that like aren't online, like telling you that you need to like

2124
01:28:55,640 --> 01:28:57,640
kill all the Jews or some shit? Right.

2125
01:28:57,640 --> 01:29:00,280
Do you have people in your everyday life that would be like

2126
01:29:00,920 --> 01:29:04,080
sad if you like went and shot up a school like because like

2127
01:29:04,440 --> 01:29:07,720
it he's kind of like alluded to shit like that before.

2128
01:29:08,640 --> 01:29:11,200
Like it's like this.

2129
01:29:11,200 --> 01:29:13,760
Like, do you have these kinds of like

2130
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:17,080
real life connections that you can actually feel happy with?

2131
01:29:17,080 --> 01:29:19,920
And I, I never got a straight answer for him.

2132
01:29:20,040 --> 01:29:22,880
But I know like I look at online and all the like,

2133
01:29:23,680 --> 01:29:27,280
like extreme like lefty, like trans people

2134
01:29:27,280 --> 01:29:30,200
that I have argued with, like and lost my twitch because of.

2135
01:29:30,400 --> 01:29:33,360
And it's like these people don't talk to people in real fucking life.

2136
01:29:33,360 --> 01:29:35,320
All of their friends are on fucking Discord.

2137
01:29:35,320 --> 01:29:37,640
And like, it's good to have friends on Discord.

2138
01:29:37,640 --> 01:29:39,760
I like talking to people on Discord. It's very fun.

2139
01:29:39,760 --> 01:29:43,760
But like I go out and I fucking, you know, like I go to my my friend's house.

2140
01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:45,160
I went to his house last night.

2141
01:29:45,160 --> 01:29:48,360
We fucking played music and we played fucking video games

2142
01:29:48,360 --> 01:29:49,680
like right there next to each other.

2143
01:29:49,680 --> 01:29:52,240
We didn't do it over the over fucking Discord.

2144
01:29:52,240 --> 01:29:54,240
So we actually have that human to human connection.

2145
01:29:54,240 --> 01:29:57,640
You know, I go out with my friends and I like we go bar hopping occasionally.

2146
01:29:57,880 --> 01:30:00,440
Like we invite people over to our house to,

2147
01:30:00,440 --> 01:30:02,920
you know, to socialize and actually, you know.

2148
01:30:04,320 --> 01:30:07,960
Have these like human experiences that people

2149
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:11,000
I think took for granted,

2150
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:15,320
and they think that it can be like one to one replicated online.

2151
01:30:15,560 --> 01:30:18,160
Right. Look at all the people who are doing long distance

2152
01:30:18,160 --> 01:30:20,920
dating and having like e-boyfriends and e-girlfriends.

2153
01:30:21,200 --> 01:30:26,320
Like it's it's not the same as having someone like that's there every day

2154
01:30:26,320 --> 01:30:29,760
with you and like like having the physical touch and shit like that, you know.

2155
01:30:31,200 --> 01:30:32,280
Yeah, yeah.

2156
01:30:32,280 --> 01:30:37,480
I you know, I'm an I'm an atheist, but at the same time, I do think that

2157
01:30:38,040 --> 01:30:41,840
now that I'm a little bit older than, you know, my my edgy 16 year old phase.

2158
01:30:41,880 --> 01:30:45,520
Yeah, I do think that something was probably lost

2159
01:30:45,520 --> 01:30:49,120
when church became not so popular anymore,

2160
01:30:49,680 --> 01:30:52,320
because even like, OK, you don't believe in God, you believe in God.

2161
01:30:52,320 --> 01:30:55,040
But like it was definitely a community that was there.

2162
01:30:55,040 --> 01:30:57,760
You know, you could go to a church, see everyone in the community

2163
01:30:57,760 --> 01:30:59,160
once a week, touch base.

2164
01:30:59,160 --> 01:31:00,200
You don't got to hang out with them every day,

2165
01:31:00,200 --> 01:31:02,480
but like maybe maybe there's a guy you don't normally see all that off.

2166
01:31:02,680 --> 01:31:04,000
You see him at church once a week.

2167
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:08,240
You can connect with your community, get a little bit of moral instruction

2168
01:31:08,360 --> 01:31:11,880
from from the priest, you know, spend your Sunday morning like.

2169
01:31:12,440 --> 01:31:14,920
I've heard this take before and I grew up.

2170
01:31:14,920 --> 01:31:20,320
My dad was a pastor for most of my life, and I out of everyone in my family,

2171
01:31:20,320 --> 01:31:23,040
I've had like the least engagement with with church stuff.

2172
01:31:23,200 --> 01:31:25,440
But I see like my older and my younger brother.

2173
01:31:25,480 --> 01:31:28,440
They both have, you know, friends that they made in church

2174
01:31:28,440 --> 01:31:32,040
and they had, you know, like lasting friendships with people

2175
01:31:32,040 --> 01:31:35,600
that they met at like summer camp at the like church events and shit. Right.

2176
01:31:35,800 --> 01:31:38,760
Like my my dad is like organize all these youth groups

2177
01:31:38,760 --> 01:31:42,440
and like the the people from those youth groups still message them on Facebook.

2178
01:31:42,440 --> 01:31:45,760
And, you know, whenever they come into Texas and they

2179
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:47,360
they'll come and visit them.

2180
01:31:47,360 --> 01:31:50,240
And like there are long lasting,

2181
01:31:50,240 --> 01:31:53,400
you know, connections that you can make with real life fucking people.

2182
01:31:53,640 --> 01:31:55,080
Right. Yeah. Through church.

2183
01:31:55,080 --> 01:31:56,520
And like I had never got that.

2184
01:31:56,520 --> 01:31:59,000
So like a lot of my friends came from online.

2185
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:02,240
Right. But, you know.

2186
01:32:02,240 --> 01:32:03,880
Well, the thing is, it doesn't have to be church, right?

2187
01:32:03,880 --> 01:32:06,760
You have it like a community center, if you're like some sort like

2188
01:32:07,320 --> 01:32:09,760
there's like Italian centers, Ukrainian centers, you know,

2189
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,600
there's there's these places for like immigrant groups.

2190
01:32:12,840 --> 01:32:14,920
There's you can get it in the military.

2191
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:16,800
You can join boy scouts if you're a kid.

2192
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:20,360
Like there's all of these institutions that exist in our society

2193
01:32:20,840 --> 01:32:25,480
that seem to be crumbling with with atomization.

2194
01:32:25,960 --> 01:32:29,000
And a materialist analysis will not help that.

2195
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,240
And I don't think the left has a solution for this.

2196
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,200
But but the right the right talks about community.

2197
01:32:34,240 --> 01:32:35,760
It talks about community building.

2198
01:32:35,760 --> 01:32:38,880
You know, it talks about all the stuff, you know,

2199
01:32:38,880 --> 01:32:41,880
the right's very community focused, is very local focused.

2200
01:32:42,320 --> 01:32:45,400
And I think they probably have solutions to the crisis

2201
01:32:45,400 --> 01:32:47,320
of meaning that are better than leftist solutions.

2202
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:52,320
Yeah, I don't know how we like get people to

2203
01:32:53,320 --> 01:32:59,560
form those IRL connections, because like I know that there's like

2204
01:32:59,560 --> 01:33:02,520
two community centers that are walking distance from me. Right.

2205
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:07,600
And I there's I don't ever see anybody there

2206
01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:10,960
unless it's like, you know, Election Day. Right.

2207
01:33:11,880 --> 01:33:16,600
So I don't know how we can like actually like pull people to go there

2208
01:33:17,240 --> 01:33:19,360
and like get those kinds of messages out.

2209
01:33:19,360 --> 01:33:23,400
Like, I know that they have little like luncheons and shit

2210
01:33:23,400 --> 01:33:25,120
and events and stuff like that.

2211
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:29,240
But I don't I don't think I know a single fucking person has ever gone to

2212
01:33:31,200 --> 01:33:33,560
to like a community center for

2213
01:33:35,160 --> 01:33:36,440
anything other than voting.

2214
01:33:37,960 --> 01:33:39,080
So, yeah, I know what you mean.

2215
01:33:39,080 --> 01:33:40,720
Same. I think it's like an old person thing.

2216
01:33:40,720 --> 01:33:43,680
And, you know, in twenty five years when they're all dead,

2217
01:33:43,680 --> 01:33:46,560
it'll probably be something that's like sorely missing from society.

2218
01:33:47,560 --> 01:33:53,320
Yeah, I feel like a lot of the people that I want to like talk to,

2219
01:33:54,200 --> 01:33:57,320
especially because it's like all of the fucking content that's online right now.

2220
01:33:57,480 --> 01:34:03,360
But the red pill shit that's trying to give young men some meaning in life.

2221
01:34:04,360 --> 01:34:07,480
I'd love to talk to either like a supporter of like the like,

2222
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:10,760
you know, Andrew Tate or fucking fresh and fit or like one of the

2223
01:34:11,040 --> 01:34:14,600
because there's no way I'm going to get into a conversation with any of like

2224
01:34:14,600 --> 01:34:17,720
the medium or larger size YouTubers unless I

2225
01:34:18,960 --> 01:34:21,400
just go like apeshit on them on Twitter and

2226
01:34:22,840 --> 01:34:24,560
somehow like pull a conversation.

2227
01:34:24,560 --> 01:34:28,040
But like, it'd be so interesting to like talk to them about that sort of thing.

2228
01:34:30,600 --> 01:34:34,640
Well, to be fair, Andrew Tate and Andrew Tate and fresh and fit,

2229
01:34:34,640 --> 01:34:37,160
there's a pretty big gap between those two.

2230
01:34:37,160 --> 01:34:37,840
I know what you mean.

2231
01:34:37,840 --> 01:34:39,600
But like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2232
01:34:40,560 --> 01:34:43,600
Secondly, I saw not so erudite on fresh and fit,

2233
01:34:43,640 --> 01:34:46,200
and she did a pretty good job going back and forth with one of them.

2234
01:34:47,080 --> 01:34:49,640
So I think I know I think I know the kind of

2235
01:34:49,640 --> 01:34:51,600
I think I know the kind of conversation that you're looking for.

2236
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:54,080
And I think she did a good job at that because she brought up

2237
01:34:54,080 --> 01:34:57,080
like traditional values and it kind of, you know, OK,

2238
01:34:57,920 --> 01:34:59,960
here's here's what I'll say about fresh and fit.

2239
01:34:59,960 --> 01:35:01,080
All right. They always say,

2240
01:35:01,080 --> 01:35:04,800
man, we are representative of what women actually think,

2241
01:35:04,800 --> 01:35:07,640
because we got all these women here, they're from different countries,

2242
01:35:07,640 --> 01:35:10,320
different classes, different education levels, different races,

2243
01:35:10,680 --> 01:35:11,920
all these different types of women.

2244
01:35:11,920 --> 01:35:13,200
So we get everyone's opinion.

2245
01:35:13,200 --> 01:35:14,840
And it's like, well, hold on.

2246
01:35:14,840 --> 01:35:17,560
You don't get opinions from women who wouldn't go on fresh and fit.

2247
01:35:18,280 --> 01:35:20,080
Yeah, it's a pretty big demographic.

2248
01:35:20,080 --> 01:35:23,800
People who wouldn't subject themselves to being on that fucking show,

2249
01:35:23,800 --> 01:35:27,720
you know, because Jesus Christ, like, mocked by like five like ultra

2250
01:35:27,720 --> 01:35:30,080
red pillars telling them that they're like roasties

2251
01:35:30,080 --> 01:35:32,560
who like slept with too many fucking men and shit.

2252
01:35:32,760 --> 01:35:35,040
You know, like, I, I wouldn't want to be a woman

2253
01:35:35,040 --> 01:35:37,440
and go on that fucking podcast for goddamn sure.

2254
01:35:37,880 --> 01:35:42,840
But but when when not so erudite walked into walked into the Wolf's Den,

2255
01:35:42,840 --> 01:35:45,760
you know, she did pretty well for herself because she she had the data.

2256
01:35:45,760 --> 01:35:47,720
She had she had her own experiences,

2257
01:35:47,720 --> 01:35:49,560
which are very different from everyone else's there.

2258
01:35:49,560 --> 01:35:51,400
She she's not a Miami girl, you know? Yeah.

2259
01:35:51,400 --> 01:35:54,200
So I think that was actually a very interesting conversation.

2260
01:35:54,720 --> 01:35:58,560
I actually all have to watch that thing because I

2261
01:35:59,480 --> 01:36:03,240
when they were first starting to go on to the fresh

2262
01:36:03,240 --> 01:36:05,280
and fit panels like Destiny and erudite and,

2263
01:36:06,960 --> 01:36:09,440
you know, all these things, Nico was there, too. Yes, Nico.

2264
01:36:09,680 --> 01:36:11,680
I cannot stand, Nico.

2265
01:36:11,680 --> 01:36:17,440
But my secret seems like a young lost guy who will come around eventually.

2266
01:36:17,560 --> 01:36:22,440
I hope so. I the only interaction I've ever had with him was bullying him

2267
01:36:22,440 --> 01:36:25,600
off of a panel on Destiny's stream, like one of those impromptu things

2268
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:27,840
after a Mr. Girl conversation. But

2269
01:36:30,240 --> 01:36:32,920
yeah, like I was so like.

2270
01:36:32,920 --> 01:36:37,160
Uninterested in those conversations at the at the beginning,

2271
01:36:37,160 --> 01:36:40,880
but now it's like it's all fucking encompassing, right?

2272
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:43,320
Like I can't escape it. It's everywhere.

2273
01:36:43,680 --> 01:36:48,800
And so now like now I'm interested because one of the one of the reasons

2274
01:36:48,800 --> 01:36:53,440
I started getting into like streaming on on Twitch and doing politics and stuff is

2275
01:36:54,040 --> 01:36:58,840
I knew a couple of people that were like relatively like normal dudes

2276
01:36:58,840 --> 01:37:00,320
in high school, right?

2277
01:37:00,320 --> 01:37:04,360
Like pretty chill dudes, nice guys, upstanding citizens.

2278
01:37:04,560 --> 01:37:08,840
And they like became like ultra far alt righty like neo Nazi.

2279
01:37:08,840 --> 01:37:12,280
I think one of them might have been at Charlottesville

2280
01:37:12,280 --> 01:37:13,800
or maybe he had friends at Charlottesville,

2281
01:37:13,800 --> 01:37:17,200
and maybe that's why he posted about it so much on Facebook. But he is.

2282
01:37:17,240 --> 01:37:21,480
Yeah, like they like went super, super, super far right afterwards.

2283
01:37:21,480 --> 01:37:26,280
And the the reason for that, as far as I can tell, based off of their posts

2284
01:37:26,280 --> 01:37:29,400
and the arguments I would get into with them, like in 20,

2285
01:37:29,560 --> 01:37:32,560
you know, 2017, 2018, 2019

2286
01:37:33,560 --> 01:37:37,080
before they blocked me was like they

2287
01:37:37,400 --> 01:37:40,840
they just had like nothing going for them, like despite everything

2288
01:37:40,840 --> 01:37:45,200
like being great for them and in high school and like all the life prospects

2289
01:37:45,200 --> 01:37:48,320
that they had, like going into

2290
01:37:48,320 --> 01:37:53,400
into adulthood, like all of that kind of just washed away.

2291
01:37:53,400 --> 01:37:56,240
Part of that is because they were like throwing their lot in with Nazis

2292
01:37:56,240 --> 01:37:58,320
and people knew who the fuck they were. But like,

2293
01:37:59,560 --> 01:38:03,640
like the the the lost young man

2294
01:38:03,640 --> 01:38:09,640
kind of, you know, stereotype is one of the reasons why I got into streaming.

2295
01:38:09,920 --> 01:38:14,040
And it's

2296
01:38:15,640 --> 01:38:19,840
I feel like a lot of people for I feel like part partly

2297
01:38:19,840 --> 01:38:23,600
because of like the coronavirus stuff in 2020 and then

2298
01:38:23,800 --> 01:38:26,480
21 came around and people kind of forgot about like,

2299
01:38:26,800 --> 01:38:32,320
you know, men's issues are like really, you know, fucked up right now. Right.

2300
01:38:33,040 --> 01:38:36,440
Now that it's coming back around now,

2301
01:38:36,440 --> 01:38:38,680
it it's piqued my interest.

2302
01:38:38,680 --> 01:38:42,400
And I I don't know, I

2303
01:38:42,400 --> 01:38:44,600
I feel like I want to have those conversations,

2304
01:38:44,600 --> 01:38:47,640
but they're like very difficult to

2305
01:38:48,680 --> 01:38:52,360
to find with the audience that I've kind of gathered

2306
01:38:52,360 --> 01:38:58,520
and then lost and then rebuilt after the switch from socialism to liberalism

2307
01:38:58,520 --> 01:39:04,040
and based trans advocate to genocide denier and all that shit. So.

2308
01:39:06,240 --> 01:39:10,160
Man, the trans genocide conversation is so fucking ridiculous.

2309
01:39:10,160 --> 01:39:12,680
I hate that one. It's insane.

2310
01:39:13,640 --> 01:39:16,800
But in terms of man, I do know what you mean.

2311
01:39:17,320 --> 01:39:21,880
Like it's not the left that caused all of these problems for men,

2312
01:39:21,880 --> 01:39:23,560
though they definitely caused some of them for sure.

2313
01:39:23,560 --> 01:39:26,400
However, the the main denial

2314
01:39:26,600 --> 01:39:29,920
that the problem even exists is 100 percent from the left.

2315
01:39:30,320 --> 01:39:34,080
And so I think there's an entire generation of young men

2316
01:39:34,080 --> 01:39:36,200
who are just never going to be left us because of that alone.

2317
01:39:36,440 --> 01:39:39,320
You know, when they were at their lowest point,

2318
01:39:39,520 --> 01:39:42,960
they were told by this group that all of their issues didn't exist.

2319
01:39:42,960 --> 01:39:46,640
And they're all just misogynists for having the issue in the first place.

2320
01:39:46,640 --> 01:39:49,960
And it's like, well, that you're not getting them back.

2321
01:39:49,960 --> 01:39:51,440
They're gone, you know?

2322
01:39:51,440 --> 01:39:55,040
Yeah. And I feel like

2323
01:39:55,040 --> 01:39:58,120
with me growing up, I never really

2324
01:39:58,120 --> 01:40:01,000
because I just like wasn't on the Internet until like twenty

2325
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:03,960
twenty seventeen, twenty eighteen.

2326
01:40:03,960 --> 01:40:08,000
I didn't see any of like the like feminists,

2327
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:11,240
like, you know, attacking men all the time. So I never

2328
01:40:12,600 --> 01:40:15,200
so I was like one of those liberals who was like, yeah,

2329
01:40:15,200 --> 01:40:18,320
what fucking problems do you have? Like, well,

2330
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:22,280
I didn't understand that until I started,

2331
01:40:22,520 --> 01:40:25,320
probably until like I started streaming or watching people

2332
01:40:25,320 --> 01:40:27,480
that like got me into streaming. Right.

2333
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:31,480
Because the the environment

2334
01:40:31,480 --> 01:40:34,440
that I grew up in was just like very chill.

2335
01:40:34,600 --> 01:40:39,280
I never like my my family have always been very, very liberal,

2336
01:40:39,280 --> 01:40:42,960
very, very, you know, pro LGBT

2337
01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:46,640
and like anti anti racist and all this shit, you know,

2338
01:40:47,320 --> 01:40:50,600
very not conservative in almost any way, shape or form.

2339
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:55,480
So I grew up in that bubble and then like getting exposed to like.

2340
01:40:56,640 --> 01:41:02,080
The online sphere initially was like of a massive shock

2341
01:41:02,080 --> 01:41:05,120
because there are all these conversations that were being had online.

2342
01:41:05,120 --> 01:41:07,880
I was like, these are not real issues. Right.

2343
01:41:08,760 --> 01:41:12,520
And to a certain degree, I still think that like most of the things

2344
01:41:12,520 --> 01:41:15,240
that people talk about online are not real issues.

2345
01:41:15,480 --> 01:41:19,840
But there are some that either aren't an issue,

2346
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:22,560
but there's a grain of truth in there or there's

2347
01:41:23,680 --> 01:41:27,240
there is an issue that's been like blown up by it,

2348
01:41:27,240 --> 01:41:30,960
like the like virulent fucking arguments

2349
01:41:30,960 --> 01:41:34,200
that happen on Twitter and on fucking the streams and shit

2350
01:41:34,400 --> 01:41:36,520
that people think that they're much more of an issue that they are.

2351
01:41:37,640 --> 01:41:40,680
So like, I think that there are there are issues

2352
01:41:40,680 --> 01:41:43,520
with men right now that need to be addressed.

2353
01:41:43,520 --> 01:41:46,000
Like they don't have very much meaning.

2354
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:50,160
You know, women are outpacing them in like academic endeavors.

2355
01:41:51,360 --> 01:41:54,320
They're being out earned by women more and more and more.

2356
01:41:54,840 --> 01:41:58,800
And so like there's like that aspect of like trying to find a partner

2357
01:41:58,800 --> 01:42:01,240
that wants to be with you if they're earning,

2358
01:42:02,040 --> 01:42:05,480
you know, if they're earning more than you than like, are you like actually a man

2359
01:42:05,480 --> 01:42:09,200
or will they even date you if you if they have a bigger paycheck than you?

2360
01:42:09,200 --> 01:42:12,920
Because people generally want to like date up or date at their level,

2361
01:42:12,920 --> 01:42:14,520
not date down.

2362
01:42:15,480 --> 01:42:18,120
But yeah, it's just like

2363
01:42:18,760 --> 01:42:22,080
it was a very strange culture shock coming into the Internet

2364
01:42:22,080 --> 01:42:24,080
and seeing these conversations, especially like

2365
01:42:25,520 --> 01:42:29,520
revisiting older like destiny content or revisiting

2366
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:33,520
like I've gone back and I've watched some of the old like skeptic videos

2367
01:42:33,920 --> 01:42:37,920
out of curiosity five years after the death of that, you know,

2368
01:42:38,920 --> 01:42:42,120
huge bubble online with all the Ransonas and stuff.

2369
01:42:43,400 --> 01:42:45,400
And it it.

2370
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:49,000
It's just a very

2371
01:42:49,560 --> 01:42:52,160
strange thing to see, like how like I grew up

2372
01:42:52,800 --> 01:42:56,440
in in this area, never seeing these issues, then seeing everybody

2373
01:42:56,440 --> 01:42:58,560
talk about these issues like they were the biggest things in the world.

2374
01:42:58,720 --> 01:43:02,160
And then like now we're at this place where we're revisiting some of those issues.

2375
01:43:02,880 --> 01:43:08,720
And some of the like conversations about it have become this like ultra fucking

2376
01:43:08,760 --> 01:43:13,760
like weird MGTOW, like just fuck as many women as you as you can growing up.

2377
01:43:13,760 --> 01:43:17,840
And then, you know, like once you're ready to settle down, like find yourself

2378
01:43:17,840 --> 01:43:21,560
like a 19 year old woman who's never fucking had a relationship

2379
01:43:21,560 --> 01:43:24,200
in her entire life and marry her because she's pure.

2380
01:43:24,200 --> 01:43:27,920
And then on the on one side of the aisle

2381
01:43:28,080 --> 01:43:31,680
and then the other side of the aisle saying like men have no issues whatsoever.

2382
01:43:31,680 --> 01:43:34,400
And women are like the like most oppressed group on Earth.

2383
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:38,240
And it's just very strange to see how the conversation has evolved.

2384
01:43:38,240 --> 01:43:39,080
You know.

2385
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:41,760
Yep, that was long, so I don't know.

2386
01:43:41,760 --> 01:43:43,240
Sorry. Yeah, exactly.

2387
01:43:43,240 --> 01:43:46,960
Again, like no medicine, I hopefully inshallah tomorrow.

2388
01:43:47,760 --> 01:43:49,520
I do pretty much agree.

2389
01:43:49,520 --> 01:43:52,480
I mean, I was one of those skeptics back in like 2014.

2390
01:43:52,480 --> 01:43:54,000
I was I was in Gamergate.

2391
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,080
I remember I'm old enough to remember that shit.

2392
01:43:56,320 --> 01:44:00,160
I mean, my first time on the Internet was like 1997.

2393
01:44:00,160 --> 01:44:02,760
I was a kid, but still, I'm I'm pretty old now, you know.

2394
01:44:02,880 --> 01:44:05,120
How old are you old enough?

2395
01:44:05,360 --> 01:44:07,040
Old enough. Old enough.

2396
01:44:07,040 --> 01:44:08,760
I was I was a 90s kid for sure.

2397
01:44:08,760 --> 01:44:10,920
And there are so many zoomers right now who don't remember

2398
01:44:10,920 --> 01:44:13,080
what it was like before 9-11, which is wild to me.

2399
01:44:13,400 --> 01:44:15,200
I guess this is what it's like getting older, you know?

2400
01:44:15,200 --> 01:44:17,040
Yeah, I was born in 95.

2401
01:44:17,040 --> 01:44:22,480
And like I I got just like the tail end of like the good times.

2402
01:44:22,680 --> 01:44:27,360
And then like everything since like 9-11 has just been like like a shit fest.

2403
01:44:27,360 --> 01:44:30,760
Like I feel really bad for my little brother because he was born in 99.

2404
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:34,840
And so he doesn't remember before 9-11 and he missed all of it.

2405
01:44:34,840 --> 01:44:37,000
He missed all he missed all of the good shit.

2406
01:44:37,200 --> 01:44:39,600
And then like everything from then on, like

2407
01:44:40,240 --> 01:44:42,480
especially with my family being so politically active, like

2408
01:44:42,720 --> 01:44:45,800
it was like constant in the household, like arguing about this stuff

2409
01:44:45,800 --> 01:44:49,360
and seeing it happen on TV and all that shit. So.

2410
01:44:50,400 --> 01:44:53,880
So for me, the most striking thing

2411
01:44:53,880 --> 01:44:57,520
is how many of those old skeptic conversations

2412
01:44:58,360 --> 01:45:00,840
we were right about speaking as a former skeptic.

2413
01:45:00,840 --> 01:45:02,440
We were actually correct about a lot of them.

2414
01:45:02,440 --> 01:45:06,320
You know, back then, it wasn't it wasn't an alt right joke.

2415
01:45:06,320 --> 01:45:10,600
It was just one of our jokes was the attack helicopter gender thing.

2416
01:45:10,600 --> 01:45:14,360
Yeah. And then and then it became an alt right thing.

2417
01:45:14,600 --> 01:45:17,720
It's like, oh, my God, only only like racist Nazis make that joke.

2418
01:45:17,720 --> 01:45:21,360
And that and now now you have demon mama on stream

2419
01:45:21,360 --> 01:45:24,960
saying attack helicopter gender is legitimate. Yes.

2420
01:45:25,280 --> 01:45:28,880
It's like we we knew that

2421
01:45:29,200 --> 01:45:32,400
this philosophy was going to lead to this point eventually.

2422
01:45:32,400 --> 01:45:35,280
And we called it like almost a decade ago.

2423
01:45:35,960 --> 01:45:39,560
We knew it was going here and it went there, you know, like.

2424
01:45:40,440 --> 01:45:45,320
So I'm at some I've been I'm being urged by chud logic

2425
01:45:45,520 --> 01:45:48,800
to eventually compile all the information that I have

2426
01:45:49,320 --> 01:45:53,360
on why there seems to be a section of the left,

2427
01:45:53,760 --> 01:45:57,520
not all the left, but a section of the left that is extremely pro pedophile

2428
01:45:58,400 --> 01:45:59,640
and why that's the case.

2429
01:45:59,640 --> 01:46:02,360
Very strange. I have

2430
01:46:02,360 --> 01:46:04,560
and I'm going to I'm going to put that together

2431
01:46:04,560 --> 01:46:08,640
and put it out because there's a philosophical backing behind it.

2432
01:46:08,800 --> 01:46:11,400
There's a bunch of literature, a bunch of political science literature

2433
01:46:11,400 --> 01:46:12,000
that I can put out.

2434
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
It's like, well, here's here's what this guy said.

2435
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:15,560
And here's how how it influenced this guy.

2436
01:46:15,560 --> 01:46:16,960
And here's this guy.

2437
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:20,760
And it runs directly down through the heart of postmodernism.

2438
01:46:21,640 --> 01:46:25,440
Yeah, because you have guys like Foucault and Derrida who are out there like

2439
01:46:26,120 --> 01:46:29,720
like fucking fucking boys and was in Tunisia or something.

2440
01:46:29,720 --> 01:46:31,120
And they're advocating for

2441
01:46:31,120 --> 01:46:34,160
age of consent to be revoked as part of the socialist project.

2442
01:46:34,440 --> 01:46:38,600
Because as it turns out, the class of adults and the class of children

2443
01:46:38,600 --> 01:46:42,280
also need to be equalized and have the power imbalances removed.

2444
01:46:42,560 --> 01:46:44,520
Like it's it's it's insane.

2445
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:46,040
It's insane, right?

2446
01:46:46,040 --> 01:46:50,400
But there is like political science, texts and literature and essays

2447
01:46:50,400 --> 01:46:53,080
and books written about the stuff that I can put forward and be like, OK, well,

2448
01:46:53,280 --> 01:46:56,320
here's how this mindset might lead

2449
01:46:56,320 --> 01:46:59,520
and has led to this thinking in some people today.

2450
01:46:59,960 --> 01:47:02,520
And I think I can put together a pretty decent case.

2451
01:47:02,520 --> 01:47:05,000
So Chud, Chudlogic is like, you got to do this video at some point.

2452
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:05,960
It's going to be spicy as fuck.

2453
01:47:05,960 --> 01:47:07,960
And I'm like, yeah, I know why you want me to do it, right?

2454
01:47:08,800 --> 01:47:10,040
I understand that.

2455
01:47:10,040 --> 01:47:13,400
Yeah, I'm I'm I'd actually be interested to see that.

2456
01:47:13,400 --> 01:47:17,480
I'm like 50 50 on like looking at

2457
01:47:18,480 --> 01:47:22,760
philosophers from like the like 1800s to the mid 20th century.

2458
01:47:23,480 --> 01:47:27,800
And trying to like follow like a direct line of

2459
01:47:29,040 --> 01:47:31,560
like secession to like see where we're at now.

2460
01:47:32,920 --> 01:47:35,120
Like especially like

2461
01:47:35,120 --> 01:47:37,680
being someone who's like interested in going into education.

2462
01:47:37,680 --> 01:47:40,160
I want to like like teach at the high school level.

2463
01:47:40,960 --> 01:47:44,280
I see all these people talking about like groomers in schools and stuff.

2464
01:47:44,280 --> 01:47:48,200
And do you know the Fabian Liberty guy? Yep.

2465
01:47:48,320 --> 01:47:52,520
Yeah, he has he seems like one of his like biggest issues is like

2466
01:47:53,080 --> 01:47:56,440
the the postmodernist, like socialist agenda

2467
01:47:56,440 --> 01:47:59,520
in in schools to groom children into being socialists.

2468
01:47:59,800 --> 01:48:02,400
And like you can.

2469
01:48:04,160 --> 01:48:08,200
Find like some parts of some philosophies

2470
01:48:08,200 --> 01:48:11,000
from postmodern thinkers in.

2471
01:48:11,960 --> 01:48:16,040
In some like initiatives like social, emotional learning,

2472
01:48:16,040 --> 01:48:18,360
which I need to learn more about

2473
01:48:18,360 --> 01:48:20,760
in these like initiatives.

2474
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:24,160
But like I I don't know how much I'm sold on it,

2475
01:48:24,160 --> 01:48:29,440
like being like this like grand agenda that's been like spanned spanning.

2476
01:48:29,520 --> 01:48:31,360
And I don't think that's what you're saying.

2477
01:48:31,360 --> 01:48:34,040
But like there's like this like.

2478
01:48:34,040 --> 01:48:36,800
Thought right now, especially like James Lindsay and people like that

2479
01:48:37,120 --> 01:48:40,040
who are like saying like there's this grand

2480
01:48:40,840 --> 01:48:44,880
initiative from socialists to like make everybody into these

2481
01:48:45,600 --> 01:48:47,840
critical thinking

2482
01:48:47,880 --> 01:48:50,240
people who are.

2483
01:48:50,240 --> 01:48:53,440
You're talking like Biden's 1619 projects, stuff like that, right?

2484
01:48:53,800 --> 01:48:56,800
Yeah, like they're like, yeah, there's like critical race theory

2485
01:48:56,800 --> 01:48:57,720
and there's critical theory.

2486
01:48:57,720 --> 01:49:00,600
And like they're trying to like push this on to like young kids

2487
01:49:00,600 --> 01:49:03,200
to do like certain things

2488
01:49:03,200 --> 01:49:06,040
to like either like indoctrinate them

2489
01:49:06,040 --> 01:49:08,640
into gender theory or some shit like that.

2490
01:49:08,880 --> 01:49:12,760
And I don't I don't know how sold I am on that, like coming from

2491
01:49:13,160 --> 01:49:16,080
like working in elementary schools and like seeing

2492
01:49:16,080 --> 01:49:18,280
what is actually being taught in elementary schools.

2493
01:49:18,880 --> 01:49:19,920
Granted, I'm in Texas.

2494
01:49:19,920 --> 01:49:22,360
So like maybe that like skews my

2495
01:49:23,240 --> 01:49:25,080
maybe the things very like hard.

2496
01:49:25,080 --> 01:49:27,720
But so I don't see I think there's some of it.

2497
01:49:28,160 --> 01:49:30,160
Karl Marx and shit, you know.

2498
01:49:30,160 --> 01:49:34,000
I think there I think there's definitely some people who do that,

2499
01:49:34,360 --> 01:49:36,440
like there's going to be some individual teachers

2500
01:49:36,440 --> 01:49:38,720
who who are absolutely biased in that direction.

2501
01:49:38,720 --> 01:49:40,720
They absolutely want to do that sort of thing.

2502
01:49:42,120 --> 01:49:44,640
I don't think they constitute like a

2503
01:49:44,640 --> 01:49:47,640
they can actual conspiracy of an organized group

2504
01:49:47,640 --> 01:49:49,480
to actually do all this sort of stuff.

2505
01:49:49,480 --> 01:49:52,400
But I don't think they have to because they all have the

2506
01:49:53,360 --> 01:49:54,560
the same training, the same education.

2507
01:49:54,560 --> 01:49:57,320
They all kind of have the same ideas, so they do it in a decentralized way.

2508
01:49:57,760 --> 01:50:00,920
However, I do think something

2509
01:50:01,400 --> 01:50:05,520
I do think it's much more prevalent at the university level than it is at the.

2510
01:50:05,560 --> 01:50:07,560
Yeah, at the grade school level.

2511
01:50:07,560 --> 01:50:09,000
And the university level, it's all over the fucking place.

2512
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:10,440
It's everywhere in the university level.

2513
01:50:10,440 --> 01:50:12,400
I don't think that it's common.

2514
01:50:12,400 --> 01:50:16,840
Like I've had out of all of my professors that I've had in Poli Sci,

2515
01:50:16,840 --> 01:50:19,200
I think I've had one conservative,

2516
01:50:19,200 --> 01:50:22,120
two centrists and all the rest of them seem to be like lefties.

2517
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:26,280
So like, I definitely do agree that there's like a bias

2518
01:50:26,280 --> 01:50:29,360
in academia for like left leaning opinions.

2519
01:50:30,960 --> 01:50:32,840
But I don't think that it's

2520
01:50:32,840 --> 01:50:34,440
and again, this is like all anecdote.

2521
01:50:34,440 --> 01:50:38,040
I can't speak for every college campus or anything like I don't.

2522
01:50:38,040 --> 01:50:41,320
I don't feel like it's ever been to a point where people can't

2523
01:50:41,320 --> 01:50:45,080
think for themselves or like get low grades because they're conservative

2524
01:50:45,080 --> 01:50:45,840
or anything.

2525
01:50:45,840 --> 01:50:50,000
I but then again, I don't know what all the arguments about like academia being

2526
01:50:51,320 --> 01:50:54,520
skewed in one way or another are, so

2527
01:50:54,520 --> 01:50:57,520
I think the academia being skewed in one way or another, that's

2528
01:50:58,040 --> 01:50:59,800
that is an important conversation.

2529
01:50:59,800 --> 01:51:03,600
And yeah, I mean, even though I'm a bit older, I do remember seeing it happen

2530
01:51:03,600 --> 01:51:05,560
when I went when I went to university, you know,

2531
01:51:05,560 --> 01:51:07,600
people having the wrong opinions and getting less grades.

2532
01:51:07,600 --> 01:51:11,240
I did see that it was mainly in the gender studies courses.

2533
01:51:11,240 --> 01:51:13,080
I took, though, not in anything else.

2534
01:51:13,080 --> 01:51:15,800
Oh, really? Yeah, I haven't taken any of those.

2535
01:51:15,800 --> 01:51:17,960
So luckily,

2536
01:51:19,360 --> 01:51:21,840
but I think like when it comes to the whole groomer thing

2537
01:51:22,400 --> 01:51:26,800
is like the one that I like to talk about is the case in California

2538
01:51:26,800 --> 01:51:28,440
where there were two

2539
01:51:28,440 --> 01:51:31,480
there were two gender queer teachers at an elementary school

2540
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:36,040
and they were using their authority to basically spy on students.

2541
01:51:36,360 --> 01:51:39,520
They would go in, they'd log in with with their administrative

2542
01:51:39,520 --> 01:51:43,080
and their administrator password or whatever into the schools

2543
01:51:43,320 --> 01:51:44,920
in the school computer system.

2544
01:51:44,920 --> 01:51:49,160
They would see they would like look at the key loggers of various student logins

2545
01:51:49,520 --> 01:51:51,840
and see what and see what these kids were talking like.

2546
01:51:51,840 --> 01:51:56,160
Probably grade two to grade six, you know, so reasonably young.

2547
01:51:57,040 --> 01:51:59,880
They would see what these kids were doing.

2548
01:51:59,880 --> 01:52:02,040
What they were searching on Google using the key logger.

2549
01:52:02,360 --> 01:52:05,080
They would pick out people who were searching about things

2550
01:52:05,280 --> 01:52:08,000
that might have been related to gender or trans stuff

2551
01:52:08,160 --> 01:52:12,400
or like like gay questioning or whatever things that could be construed in that way.

2552
01:52:12,720 --> 01:52:15,040
They would pick those people out, write down their names for later,

2553
01:52:15,240 --> 01:52:18,560
and then single them out at some point and invite them to

2554
01:52:19,640 --> 01:52:21,800
to a gender club.

2555
01:52:22,320 --> 01:52:26,520
And this club was not the school's normal, the normal pride club.

2556
01:52:26,520 --> 01:52:28,600
It was like their own thing that they had been running on the side.

2557
01:52:28,960 --> 01:52:32,720
And once in that club, these two teachers would convince these kids

2558
01:52:32,720 --> 01:52:35,920
that they're trans and tell them not to tell their parents, because if they

2559
01:52:36,320 --> 01:52:39,640
it because of the nasty Republicans in the government,

2560
01:52:39,880 --> 01:52:43,480
if you're if anyone learns that you're trans, you'll be taken away from your parents.

2561
01:52:43,880 --> 01:52:46,560
So the only person that you can tell is is us.

2562
01:52:46,880 --> 01:52:48,520
And like they would love bomb them.

2563
01:52:48,520 --> 01:52:50,720
But then they would also say, listen, it has to be a secret.

2564
01:52:50,720 --> 01:52:53,680
And it ended up getting to like there's this one.

2565
01:52:53,960 --> 01:52:57,440
There's this one little girl who they tried to convince very strongly

2566
01:52:57,440 --> 01:52:59,840
that she was that she was a trans man.

2567
01:52:59,840 --> 01:53:01,960
She was not she turned out just to be bisexual.

2568
01:53:02,520 --> 01:53:04,160
She found out a little bit later in life.

2569
01:53:04,160 --> 01:53:06,200
But eventually this all blew up and it was discovered.

2570
01:53:06,480 --> 01:53:09,920
And these two these two teachers are now being

2571
01:53:10,280 --> 01:53:13,400
dragged through the legal system as they should, because that's pretty monstrous

2572
01:53:13,400 --> 01:53:15,960
what they did. But here's the thing.

2573
01:53:15,960 --> 01:53:17,360
I can tell you that story.

2574
01:53:17,360 --> 01:53:19,640
And it's a it's a case of legitimate grooming

2575
01:53:20,080 --> 01:53:23,080
happening by by these two terrible teachers. Sure. All right.

2576
01:53:23,320 --> 01:53:26,720
And it had its 15 minutes of fame on lives of TikTok and all of it.

2577
01:53:27,240 --> 01:53:32,240
However, because that story is so sensationalist, it sticks in people's minds

2578
01:53:32,240 --> 01:53:35,120
and people think, oh, this is every time I see. Yeah.

2579
01:53:35,120 --> 01:53:38,480
Yes. Every time I see, you know, a blue haired person on Twitter

2580
01:53:38,680 --> 01:53:41,720
who hangs a Black Lives Matter flag in their in their

2581
01:53:42,040 --> 01:53:44,640
their classroom, regardless of whether or not that's appropriate.

2582
01:53:44,840 --> 01:53:48,000
The fact that they're doing they must also be secretly grooming kids, too.

2583
01:53:48,080 --> 01:53:51,320
And everyone that I see on lives of TikTok has to be secretly grooming kids.

2584
01:53:51,480 --> 01:53:55,040
And as soon as you see like even 20 legitimate stories of it happening,

2585
01:53:55,200 --> 01:53:57,200
you think it's happening everywhere.

2586
01:53:57,200 --> 01:54:02,080
But 20 stories in a nation of 330 million people isn't actually that many people.

2587
01:54:02,400 --> 01:54:03,920
You know, it's still bad,

2588
01:54:03,920 --> 01:54:07,280
but it's not happening at the rates that right wing people think it's happening.

2589
01:54:07,280 --> 01:54:08,400
One thousand percent.

2590
01:54:08,400 --> 01:54:11,080
That's exactly what I mean, because every single time this topic comes up,

2591
01:54:11,240 --> 01:54:13,800
I say, like, can you show me any example of this happening?

2592
01:54:13,800 --> 01:54:17,520
Like at like a district wide level where this is like some sort of policy

2593
01:54:17,520 --> 01:54:21,160
that they're like going forward and like, you know, having clubs

2594
01:54:21,160 --> 01:54:23,960
where like people come out as trans and give them hormones

2595
01:54:23,960 --> 01:54:26,520
or give them like the information of how to access hormones

2596
01:54:26,920 --> 01:54:28,160
without their parents knowledge.

2597
01:54:28,160 --> 01:54:31,520
Can you give me any like curriculum that's being implemented

2598
01:54:31,520 --> 01:54:33,880
in like either a state or a local level?

2599
01:54:33,880 --> 01:54:38,480
That's like like trying to like indoctrinate people into gender theory,

2600
01:54:38,480 --> 01:54:42,840
fucking, you know, critical theory, critical race theory shit.

2601
01:54:43,040 --> 01:54:44,480
Like, can you show me any of this shit?

2602
01:54:44,480 --> 01:54:47,160
And like, I might get like one example of like a teacher

2603
01:54:47,160 --> 01:54:49,240
going like a little bit too far or like doing something

2604
01:54:49,240 --> 01:54:51,760
that's like pretty objectively horrible, like

2605
01:54:52,640 --> 01:54:54,720
depends on like what the scale of it is. Right.

2606
01:54:56,560 --> 01:54:59,760
Or like a charter school, like an individual school

2607
01:54:59,760 --> 01:55:03,480
that does not like that is not beholden to like a whole school

2608
01:55:04,280 --> 01:55:06,120
school wide system

2609
01:55:06,520 --> 01:55:09,520
implementing something, but never something on like a grand scale.

2610
01:55:09,520 --> 01:55:11,920
And that's what I would have to see in order to be like, OK, yep,

2611
01:55:11,920 --> 01:55:14,200
we've gone too far. This is this is fucking crazy.

2612
01:55:14,400 --> 01:55:16,920
I think that individual teachers absolutely should be like

2613
01:55:17,560 --> 01:55:22,280
should use much greater discretion on when and where to talk about

2614
01:55:22,280 --> 01:55:25,360
like sexuality and shit like that, because there are like

2615
01:55:25,520 --> 01:55:28,440
there are some things like there are famous authors.

2616
01:55:28,440 --> 01:55:30,040
I don't know.

2617
01:55:30,040 --> 01:55:32,240
I can see his face, maybe Oscar Wilde,

2618
01:55:32,440 --> 01:55:34,920
who was a gay man or a bisexual man or something like that.

2619
01:55:35,040 --> 01:55:36,360
And that might have called you gay. Yeah.

2620
01:55:36,360 --> 01:55:39,040
Yeah. That might have colored some of his writing.

2621
01:55:39,040 --> 01:55:42,520
And maybe that's something that is relevant to bring up in a certain context.

2622
01:55:42,520 --> 01:55:45,680
Right. And that shouldn't be like off limits to talk about.

2623
01:55:45,880 --> 01:55:49,160
But like if you're like teaching fucking math, like there's no reason

2624
01:55:49,160 --> 01:55:51,440
to like talk about fucking like gender shit. Right.

2625
01:55:52,200 --> 01:55:55,480
Like even in biology, I don't think that that's necessarily

2626
01:55:56,040 --> 01:55:58,400
a good place to talk about it.

2627
01:55:58,400 --> 01:56:02,400
But if you're like taking a health class, that's probably like more appropriate

2628
01:56:03,080 --> 01:56:05,720
to talk about that, depending on what the age level is

2629
01:56:05,720 --> 01:56:07,880
and what the conversation is. Right.

2630
01:56:08,040 --> 01:56:10,680
It has to be like matched to like the appropriate age level

2631
01:56:10,680 --> 01:56:13,120
and the context of what it is, you know.

2632
01:56:14,560 --> 01:56:18,680
But yeah, like every time I ask for any kind of example of this

2633
01:56:18,680 --> 01:56:22,480
happening at mass scale, I never, ever, ever get examples of it

2634
01:56:22,720 --> 01:56:25,000
except for like a lives of TikTok tweet.

2635
01:56:25,280 --> 01:56:28,200
And that like bugs the fuck out of me.

2636
01:56:28,400 --> 01:56:31,960
That like we can't, you know, pass anecdote. Yeah.

2637
01:56:33,040 --> 01:56:36,320
Even if you assume that every single case

2638
01:56:36,320 --> 01:56:39,920
on lives of TikTok is exactly as she presents it,

2639
01:56:40,400 --> 01:56:44,720
that's still not enough to say like there's a huge problem in America.

2640
01:56:44,760 --> 01:56:46,200
That's still a minority of people.

2641
01:56:46,200 --> 01:56:48,560
You know, it's still bad, still has to be stopped.

2642
01:56:48,600 --> 01:56:51,320
But it's not like it's happening everywhere all the time.

2643
01:56:51,560 --> 01:56:53,960
And therefore, you need to pull your kids out of school immediately

2644
01:56:54,240 --> 01:56:55,400
or else they're going to turn gay.

2645
01:56:55,400 --> 01:56:57,400
Like that's that's a bit too far for me.

2646
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,480
Yeah. What do you think about all the

2647
01:57:00,480 --> 01:57:02,480
the like conservative parents saying that we need to

2648
01:57:03,400 --> 01:57:06,040
pull all of our kids out of school and start homeschooling them?

2649
01:57:06,880 --> 01:57:09,080
Because it feels like if anybody is talking about

2650
01:57:10,200 --> 01:57:13,640
like actively politically grooming, even if we're not talking about

2651
01:57:13,640 --> 01:57:16,520
like sexually grooming, like politically grooming children

2652
01:57:17,080 --> 01:57:20,760
into some sort of ideology, it would be the people who are like, no, like the

2653
01:57:21,200 --> 01:57:26,120
like the the tested curriculums that are being taught in public schools

2654
01:57:26,120 --> 01:57:27,280
across the country.

2655
01:57:27,280 --> 01:57:30,240
That is that is way too far left.

2656
01:57:30,400 --> 01:57:33,480
We're going to teach people about like our version of history.

2657
01:57:33,480 --> 01:57:35,080
1776 project.

2658
01:57:35,080 --> 01:57:40,280
Let's fucking go at home and don't interact with anyone that disagrees with you.

2659
01:57:40,880 --> 01:57:45,280
To be honest, I actually don't necessarily mind the idea of 1776.

2660
01:57:45,360 --> 01:57:48,720
I mean, you should probably be taught the good things that America has done

2661
01:57:48,720 --> 01:57:49,520
in its history.

2662
01:57:49,520 --> 01:57:52,920
You don't need to be you don't need to be bludgeoning kids at five years old

2663
01:57:52,920 --> 01:57:55,280
or seven years old or something about all the negative stuff

2664
01:57:55,480 --> 01:57:58,000
that can wait until they have some more critical thinking skills.

2665
01:57:58,000 --> 01:57:59,120
You know, you should.

2666
01:57:59,120 --> 01:58:01,960
High school is probably where you should start talking about like

2667
01:58:02,240 --> 01:58:05,280
slavery in detail or like the yeah, yeah.

2668
01:58:05,320 --> 01:58:08,000
Native American genocide shit that happened, you know, like

2669
01:58:09,640 --> 01:58:11,680
but for me.

2670
01:58:13,920 --> 01:58:17,440
And again, like maybe I maybe I'm just old and this isn't what they taught us

2671
01:58:17,440 --> 01:58:21,960
and when I was in school, right, I'm 27 years old and I'm old and have arthritis.

2672
01:58:22,160 --> 01:58:26,760
But I don't feel like I was ever like bludgeoned

2673
01:58:26,760 --> 01:58:30,200
with how bad America was and like I graduated in 2014.

2674
01:58:30,200 --> 01:58:32,640
So like there was a lot of like the Tumblr shit going on.

2675
01:58:32,640 --> 01:58:34,640
Maybe it's changed a lot since then.

2676
01:58:34,640 --> 01:58:39,160
But yeah, it feels like people aren't being taught

2677
01:58:39,440 --> 01:58:41,560
just like how evil America is.

2678
01:58:42,480 --> 01:58:45,480
Maybe there are young people in chat that can.

2679
01:58:45,480 --> 01:58:48,920
Disagree with that, but it feels like there's a pretty like.

2680
01:58:49,920 --> 01:58:52,640
The slavery, slavery was bad

2681
01:58:52,920 --> 01:58:57,520
and it was bad to be a clan member, and like that's about as as like.

2682
01:58:57,520 --> 01:59:00,120
So I was in high school.

2683
01:59:00,120 --> 01:59:02,480
I was in high school in the mid 2000s.

2684
01:59:02,480 --> 01:59:05,280
And I remember.

2685
01:59:05,280 --> 01:59:08,520
I remember a teacher, it was in a civics class,

2686
01:59:08,520 --> 01:59:12,800
it was last year of high school for me in civics.

2687
01:59:13,360 --> 01:59:16,000
And a teacher says.

2688
01:59:16,040 --> 01:59:19,840
And she was in retrospect, she was she was very far left, even for the time.

2689
01:59:20,200 --> 01:59:22,760
And she said, well.

2690
01:59:22,760 --> 01:59:25,600
It's completely fine for black people to say

2691
01:59:26,480 --> 01:59:29,400
black pride, but white people can't say white pride.

2692
01:59:30,240 --> 01:59:32,640
And then she talked about the intersectional reason as to why

2693
01:59:32,640 --> 01:59:36,080
and you know, who has historically had power and all this stuff.

2694
01:59:36,280 --> 01:59:38,800
And I was like, well, that sounds kind of stupid, right?

2695
01:59:38,800 --> 01:59:40,280
And the entire class like that sounds stupid.

2696
01:59:40,280 --> 01:59:41,800
Shouldn't it be equal for everything?

2697
01:59:41,800 --> 01:59:44,840
We were all we're all like liberal normies, right?

2698
01:59:44,880 --> 01:59:46,520
So that that all sounds kind of stupid.

2699
01:59:46,520 --> 01:59:48,480
And she was like, no, that's how that's how it is.

2700
01:59:48,480 --> 01:59:49,480
And she was like,

2701
01:59:49,480 --> 01:59:53,040
she she got so much pushback from the entire class that she dropped it.

2702
01:59:53,520 --> 01:59:55,480
So this was mid 2000s.

2703
01:59:55,480 --> 01:59:58,880
So there was at least one person in my experience trying to push it

2704
01:59:58,880 --> 02:00:00,440
and it wasn't really sticking.

2705
02:00:00,440 --> 02:00:03,360
But then by the time I got to I went to university, dropped out,

2706
02:00:03,440 --> 02:00:06,880
went back to university on my second time through university.

2707
02:00:07,400 --> 02:00:10,880
It was completely it was completely

2708
02:00:11,760 --> 02:00:14,440
it was all intersectional and everyone was cool with it.

2709
02:00:14,440 --> 02:00:18,800
And if you if you gave a non intersectional take in a lot of these classes,

2710
02:00:18,800 --> 02:00:21,640
you would actually get punished for it by the professor. So

2711
02:00:22,560 --> 02:00:26,440
I have seen the progression of things and how things have changed over time.

2712
02:00:27,320 --> 02:00:30,920
So I do think it's probably gotten even more in

2713
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:34,400
in that direction since we've both left school. Yeah.

2714
02:00:34,680 --> 02:00:38,120
If you were to go into into like a high school class right now,

2715
02:00:38,120 --> 02:00:41,080
they're probably actually here.

2716
02:00:41,240 --> 02:00:43,520
I I was searching this up.

2717
02:00:43,520 --> 02:00:44,880
I don't know if you've seen this.

2718
02:00:44,880 --> 02:00:47,080
You mentioned math, right?

2719
02:00:47,080 --> 02:00:50,680
Oh, is this going to be like the black kids can't learn unless they're dancing thing?

2720
02:00:51,240 --> 02:00:55,360
No, no, no. The the deconstructing racism in mathematics.

2721
02:00:57,240 --> 02:01:00,400
You see shit like this all the time, all the time.

2722
02:01:00,400 --> 02:01:03,360
And like, even if there's something of value in here,

2723
02:01:03,680 --> 02:01:07,360
the when something like this goes viral on Twitter, you're like,

2724
02:01:08,160 --> 02:01:11,160
you're like, what the what the fuck? Why is this?

2725
02:01:11,560 --> 02:01:16,040
You know, why is there a greater like this is like a criticism in regular math.

2726
02:01:16,040 --> 02:01:18,240
There is a greater focus on getting the right answer

2727
02:01:18,240 --> 02:01:21,240
than understanding concepts and reasoning. And it's like, well.

2728
02:01:22,320 --> 02:01:23,880
Talk about math here, you know?

2729
02:01:23,880 --> 02:01:29,200
Yeah, I do have to I could I could steel man that it's not necessarily wrong.

2730
02:01:29,520 --> 02:01:33,680
But fuck the framing of it, like as dismantling white supremacy

2731
02:01:33,680 --> 02:01:38,320
is so fucking dog shit like the the steel man of that that I would give is like

2732
02:01:39,320 --> 02:01:43,440
there are a lot of I was able to pass all of my math classes in high school,

2733
02:01:43,440 --> 02:01:46,000
but I did not understand the fucking concepts.

2734
02:01:46,200 --> 02:01:48,600
OK, I like memorize some of the fucking

2735
02:01:49,600 --> 02:01:51,440
formulas and I just,

2736
02:01:51,440 --> 02:01:54,720
you know, plugged and played and like prayed to get through it. But.

2737
02:01:56,480 --> 02:02:00,200
I feel like I would probably be like significantly better at math

2738
02:02:00,200 --> 02:02:04,360
and probably a smarter person overall, if I was able to understand the concepts

2739
02:02:04,360 --> 02:02:07,680
and the reasoning behind like why we get to this point, like I

2740
02:02:08,640 --> 02:02:12,280
I recently had to learn some of the oh, shit, what do they call it? The.

2741
02:02:13,760 --> 02:02:17,360
Oh, there's like a kind of like doing a way of doing math

2742
02:02:17,360 --> 02:02:21,360
that triggers the fuck out of conservatives and like older people nowadays.

2743
02:02:23,440 --> 02:02:25,400
It's going to kill me until I get

2744
02:02:25,400 --> 02:02:30,640
until someone says it, but I'm like, like seeing how like they're teaching math

2745
02:02:30,640 --> 02:02:33,960
now in elementary school, it's like, oh, that's how I do math in my head. Right.

2746
02:02:34,880 --> 02:02:37,720
And like this is like a really great way

2747
02:02:37,920 --> 02:02:41,560
to like teach people from a very, very young age. Right.

2748
02:02:42,360 --> 02:02:45,320
Well, Common Core, thank you, Sir Wolfgang based

2749
02:02:45,880 --> 02:02:49,080
like the Common Core thing is like actually super fucking base.

2750
02:02:49,080 --> 02:02:50,680
It's honestly super cool.

2751
02:02:50,680 --> 02:02:55,600
And the strategies that they're teaching kids using Common Core is really, really

2752
02:02:56,240 --> 02:02:59,600
like a great way to build those critical thinking skills at a very young age.

2753
02:02:59,840 --> 02:03:04,400
But like the the framing of the like picture that you sent,

2754
02:03:04,400 --> 02:03:07,560
like the dismantling white supremacy in math classrooms

2755
02:03:08,120 --> 02:03:11,560
is so unbelievably fucking cringy.

2756
02:03:11,760 --> 02:03:15,040
And like there's another streamer

2757
02:03:15,880 --> 02:03:19,840
that I've argued with in the past and that just argued with Kefle's poly people

2758
02:03:20,120 --> 02:03:23,600
who I've noticed this big trend with lefties where like

2759
02:03:24,200 --> 02:03:28,200
we can't argue like the the actual topic that we're arguing about

2760
02:03:28,200 --> 02:03:32,080
because I have to like move five or six layers of separation

2761
02:03:32,080 --> 02:03:35,040
away from that thing in order to argue about white supremacy.

2762
02:03:35,240 --> 02:03:39,280
And I feel like that is a dog shit way to explain the world to most people.

2763
02:03:39,440 --> 02:03:44,600
Right. Outside of like hyper academic circles that are trying to explain,

2764
02:03:44,680 --> 02:03:49,880
you know, like expansive sociological issues. Right.

2765
02:03:51,600 --> 02:03:55,160
So like I could I could understand what they're saying here,

2766
02:03:55,160 --> 02:03:59,320
but like to call it white supremacy, to get the right answer is so fucking stupid

2767
02:03:59,640 --> 02:04:02,680
and it makes the left look so fucking retarded.

2768
02:04:03,680 --> 02:04:05,480
Well, so you've seen this then, right?

2769
02:04:05,480 --> 02:04:07,680
Because this is kind of where that comes from.

2770
02:04:07,680 --> 02:04:09,880
This is from the Smithsonian in 2020.

2771
02:04:09,880 --> 02:04:11,880
This is a very well known thing that got pulled.

2772
02:04:11,880 --> 02:04:14,640
It was like a. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

2773
02:04:15,240 --> 02:04:19,360
So white culture is individualism and having a nuclear family.

2774
02:04:19,360 --> 02:04:21,040
Emphasis on the scientific method.

2775
02:04:21,040 --> 02:04:24,760
Predecent work, work ethic, hard work is the key to success.

2776
02:04:24,960 --> 02:04:26,200
Work before play.

2777
02:04:26,200 --> 02:04:28,320
If you didn't meet your goals, you didn't work hard enough.

2778
02:04:28,520 --> 02:04:30,240
Like how is that whiteness?

2779
02:04:30,240 --> 02:04:32,920
Are you saying that nonwhite people are lazy? Like what?

2780
02:04:33,440 --> 02:04:36,000
Yeah. Oh, my God. Messaging.

2781
02:04:36,200 --> 02:04:39,600
But because it like fits into the kind of

2782
02:04:41,320 --> 02:04:44,200
ideals that they're trying to push, like to try like

2783
02:04:44,400 --> 02:04:47,520
because I feel like when I started being a leftist, the critiques

2784
02:04:47,520 --> 02:04:50,560
that were being levied were relatively reasonable.

2785
02:04:50,560 --> 02:04:52,960
Maybe there were like a couple of things that might have been a stretch,

2786
02:04:53,080 --> 02:04:55,120
but they were like relatively reasonable.

2787
02:04:55,120 --> 02:05:00,880
But like over time, since, you know, like 20, fuck 2016

2788
02:05:01,560 --> 02:05:04,440
when I started getting Trump got elected and everyone went insane. Yeah.

2789
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:08,200
Well, yeah, I hate to say it like that, but

2790
02:05:09,280 --> 02:05:12,240
like there was probably a lead up, especially online,

2791
02:05:12,240 --> 02:05:15,160
that I wasn't aware of because I just wasn't an online person.

2792
02:05:15,360 --> 02:05:18,760
But like when I was like watching YouTube videos,

2793
02:05:18,760 --> 02:05:20,960
it feels like so many of those things were like relatively reasonable.

2794
02:05:20,960 --> 02:05:23,120
Like, oh, we can look at like how,

2795
02:05:24,800 --> 02:05:28,760
you know, Jim Crow laws could still affect people nowadays. Right.

2796
02:05:28,920 --> 02:05:31,520
OK, that's pretty reasonable. I can understand how that happened. Right.

2797
02:05:31,680 --> 02:05:35,520
But then like it kept on going forward and kept on going forward. And.

2798
02:05:36,560 --> 02:05:41,120
You know, I can like see the through line of how people got to the position

2799
02:05:41,120 --> 02:05:45,480
that we're at now with like working hard as white culture. Right.

2800
02:05:45,880 --> 02:05:49,720
Or like being on time is white culture, like that thing says.

2801
02:05:49,920 --> 02:05:54,400
But it's just just a fucking insane way

2802
02:05:54,400 --> 02:05:57,960
to frame all of our conversations around white supremacy.

2803
02:06:00,040 --> 02:06:03,080
And it's because because of that

2804
02:06:03,080 --> 02:06:07,840
conversation was being had in 2015, 2016, 2017. Right.

2805
02:06:09,960 --> 02:06:12,680
People really know these arguments in and out. Right.

2806
02:06:13,200 --> 02:06:16,360
And that's all they can argue, because that's what they've been hearing

2807
02:06:16,360 --> 02:06:19,160
for the past, you know, nearly 10 years.

2808
02:06:19,640 --> 02:06:21,800
And so, yeah, because that's all they've heard.

2809
02:06:21,960 --> 02:06:23,440
That's all they know how to argue.

2810
02:06:23,440 --> 02:06:25,560
And that's because it's all they know how to argue.

2811
02:06:25,720 --> 02:06:30,040
Every conversation has to be brought back all those layers of separation

2812
02:06:30,040 --> 02:06:33,920
to the original like seed that was planted in your mind.

2813
02:06:33,920 --> 02:06:38,440
It's depressing as a left leaning person.

2814
02:06:39,160 --> 02:06:40,960
So so when I mentioned earlier

2815
02:06:40,960 --> 02:06:45,160
that that we saw this coming like eight, 10 years ago,

2816
02:06:45,560 --> 02:06:47,280
this is another one of those things that we saw coming.

2817
02:06:47,280 --> 02:06:51,320
We like we there you can probably go find like 2014, 2015

2818
02:06:51,320 --> 02:06:56,960
era Sargon videos where he says one day the left will just be openly anti white

2819
02:06:57,480 --> 02:06:59,000
and it will be because of this reason.

2820
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:00,960
And they're not there yet, but it'll be because of this reason.

2821
02:07:01,360 --> 02:07:03,000
And it turns out that's where we are. Right.

2822
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:06,000
And I'm reminded of.

2823
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:09,480
To bring back the Internet's oldest boogeyman, Anita Sarkeesian,

2824
02:07:09,880 --> 02:07:12,520
I'm reminded of that lecture she gave in 2015,

2825
02:07:13,120 --> 02:07:16,480
where she talked about like linking up her feminism with socialism

2826
02:07:16,760 --> 02:07:19,360
and how there has to be a true anti capitalist revolution.

2827
02:07:19,360 --> 02:07:21,760
And I'm like, listen, no one watched this fucking thing

2828
02:07:21,760 --> 02:07:23,360
because no one actually cares.

2829
02:07:23,360 --> 02:07:27,320
But she was saying this in 2015 and no one was listening

2830
02:07:27,400 --> 02:07:28,800
and people weren't really doing it,

2831
02:07:28,800 --> 02:07:30,760
but they were eventually going to bring it there.

2832
02:07:30,760 --> 02:07:32,520
And they did eventually bring it there.

2833
02:07:32,520 --> 02:07:34,720
And it's like I said, with the attack helicopter thing,

2834
02:07:34,920 --> 02:07:37,720
it went from being a joke to something somebody's

2835
02:07:37,720 --> 02:07:41,440
actually advocating for because it's the natural end result of their logic.

2836
02:07:41,720 --> 02:07:44,320
And I think that that.

2837
02:07:45,480 --> 02:07:48,640
Modern leftism in its current form

2838
02:07:48,960 --> 02:07:51,440
that we're seeing right now in the English speaking world

2839
02:07:51,880 --> 02:07:55,360
was always going to lead here from where it was 10 years ago.

2840
02:07:56,320 --> 02:07:59,240
Because it's just the natural end result of that logic, you know, if.

2841
02:08:00,280 --> 02:08:03,960
You have intersectionality and then you have certain privileged groups

2842
02:08:03,960 --> 02:08:06,720
and they're privileged because they're historically been underprivileged.

2843
02:08:06,720 --> 02:08:09,240
And so we want to kind of equalize the playing field.

2844
02:08:09,600 --> 02:08:13,360
You just take that point of view to its natural end result and you get this.

2845
02:08:13,360 --> 02:08:16,680
You get all the shit that no one actually wants and no one actually believes in,

2846
02:08:16,680 --> 02:08:19,000
except for the most the most crazy ideologues

2847
02:08:19,160 --> 02:08:21,000
and also those people who benefit from it.

2848
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:23,520
But like, it's it's not good. It's not good where we are.

2849
02:08:23,520 --> 02:08:25,640
The main reason one of the main reasons

2850
02:08:25,640 --> 02:08:28,560
that I'm not a leftist is because of this shit, right? Yeah.

2851
02:08:28,800 --> 02:08:31,720
The second a second big reason is because I was told a lot

2852
02:08:32,040 --> 02:08:33,800
that I'm a liberal, not a leftist.

2853
02:08:33,800 --> 02:08:35,200
And I was like, OK, fair enough.

2854
02:08:35,200 --> 02:08:37,480
If being a liberal means that I'm on the right, then fine, I'm on the right.

2855
02:08:37,520 --> 02:08:38,720
I don't care about that.

2856
02:08:38,720 --> 02:08:40,880
You know, I don't give a shit about the label of left.

2857
02:08:41,080 --> 02:08:43,440
Yeah, I for me, like.

2858
02:08:46,080 --> 02:08:47,360
I feel like.

2859
02:08:48,600 --> 02:08:53,360
Being being brought up as like a like a hardcore Democrat, right,

2860
02:08:53,360 --> 02:08:57,880
like family ran for Democratic office and shit and like.

2861
02:08:57,920 --> 02:08:59,560
So there was always those conversations,

2862
02:08:59,560 --> 02:09:02,200
like the the path to like becoming a socialist,

2863
02:09:02,200 --> 02:09:05,200
especially as like an ultra like young person

2864
02:09:06,720 --> 02:09:09,800
was like pretty clear, especially

2865
02:09:09,800 --> 02:09:14,600
like going back to the whole like lack of purpose in young men's life, like the.

2866
02:09:16,360 --> 02:09:18,520
Trying to find like solutions

2867
02:09:18,520 --> 02:09:22,040
for the the woes of the world was probably what got me there.

2868
02:09:24,160 --> 02:09:26,640
But I guess I had a lot of young people.

2869
02:09:26,640 --> 02:09:28,800
Yeah, a lot of people are like that. Yeah.

2870
02:09:28,800 --> 02:09:32,200
And I feel like I I had more faith

2871
02:09:32,200 --> 02:09:36,280
in people to like be reasonable about a lot of things

2872
02:09:37,400 --> 02:09:39,760
until like really recently.

2873
02:09:39,960 --> 02:09:43,240
I felt like eventually like, OK, well, this is really fucking stupid.

2874
02:09:43,240 --> 02:09:45,120
But most people don't think that.

2875
02:09:45,120 --> 02:09:50,120
I would I I think I would disagree that like the left is openly anti-white.

2876
02:09:50,160 --> 02:09:53,120
I think that that's still like an ultra contentious

2877
02:09:54,240 --> 02:09:57,240
topic in leftist circles.

2878
02:09:57,240 --> 02:10:01,280
But like the the further left you get, the more that you do see people

2879
02:10:01,280 --> 02:10:04,600
like actually just like actually being racist towards white people.

2880
02:10:04,600 --> 02:10:06,360
It's like actually fucking insane.

2881
02:10:06,360 --> 02:10:08,400
The kinds of shit that people will say.

2882
02:10:08,400 --> 02:10:12,960
I learned some racial slurs for white people I didn't even know fucking existed

2883
02:10:13,160 --> 02:10:17,680
until, you know, like I started arguing with people online, you know.

2884
02:10:19,200 --> 02:10:23,480
So. I think I know what you mean.

2885
02:10:23,480 --> 02:10:25,560
Yeah, I think I know what you mean.

2886
02:10:26,560 --> 02:10:27,560
Shit, what were you saying?

2887
02:10:27,560 --> 02:10:29,160
What do you say like three sentences ago?

2888
02:10:29,160 --> 02:10:30,600
Because I had something I want to jump in with.

2889
02:10:30,600 --> 02:10:31,600
I didn't jump in.

2890
02:10:31,600 --> 02:10:36,160
I talked about starting off as a as a like hardcore Democrat,

2891
02:10:36,160 --> 02:10:39,200
the obvious path to socialism. Yeah.

2892
02:10:40,480 --> 02:10:42,400
Was it before or after that?

2893
02:10:42,400 --> 02:10:44,040
I was after that. Yeah.

2894
02:10:44,880 --> 02:10:47,280
Talked about how. Fuck.

2895
02:10:47,800 --> 02:10:52,640
There's a the left is it's a contentious topic of being anti-white.

2896
02:10:53,640 --> 02:10:55,520
It was before that, it was right in the middle.

2897
02:10:55,520 --> 02:10:58,080
Oh, you know, here, I'll just go back and listen, I guess.

2898
02:10:58,120 --> 02:11:00,640
OK, I'll look at chat for a second.

2899
02:11:00,920 --> 02:11:02,640
I'll mute for a sec.

2900
02:11:04,320 --> 02:11:05,920
Let's see here.

2901
02:11:09,640 --> 02:11:12,400
If it's a white person would be late for an appointment,

2902
02:11:12,400 --> 02:11:15,840
I'd be oppressing people of color because it would be so fucking stupid.

2903
02:11:16,920 --> 02:11:21,320
Hey, guys, if you guys if you guys haven't already subscribed, you should.

2904
02:11:22,640 --> 02:11:26,320
I got banned off of Twitch because of really stupid reasons.

2905
02:11:26,520 --> 02:11:28,960
So this is now my only streaming platform

2906
02:11:29,520 --> 02:11:32,400
besides like comfy dot stream or whatever the fuck.

2907
02:11:32,640 --> 02:11:35,720
So subscribe, we're going to be putting out more videos.

2908
02:11:35,720 --> 02:11:39,800
I have a. An editor and all that shit.

2909
02:11:42,720 --> 02:11:44,200
Let me see here.

2910
02:11:47,120 --> 02:11:49,800
Man, I can't I can't re find it.

2911
02:11:49,800 --> 02:11:51,440
My brain's not bringing it back.

2912
02:11:51,480 --> 02:11:53,120
Oh, damn. Thanks. Sorry.

2913
02:11:53,120 --> 02:11:55,200
I guess this is just gone.

2914
02:11:55,200 --> 02:11:56,360
I guess it's just gone. All right.

2915
02:11:56,360 --> 02:11:59,440
P. Oh, shit.

2916
02:12:01,720 --> 02:12:03,880
Man, was there anything else?

2917
02:12:03,880 --> 02:12:08,440
Sure. I don't have anything unless there's

2918
02:12:09,280 --> 02:12:11,560
something specific that you want to ask me.

2919
02:12:12,240 --> 02:12:15,960
I know Stardust was she really wanted us to talk, but Stardust isn't even here.

2920
02:12:16,720 --> 02:12:19,040
Well, the reason for that was

2921
02:12:19,040 --> 02:12:22,000
on election night in November,

2922
02:12:23,560 --> 02:12:27,560
I was just like panel hopping, just like seeing what everybody was saying.

2923
02:12:28,680 --> 02:12:32,920
And we were going to be on the same panel, but then she jumped onto yours.

2924
02:12:32,920 --> 02:12:37,080
I was like, OK, well, if he's if he has an open spot, see if he'll have me on.

2925
02:12:37,840 --> 02:12:40,600
And she said that you thought that I hated you.

2926
02:12:40,720 --> 02:12:43,080
I was like, I don't I don't know who the fuck this guy is.

2927
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:47,880
That was back from when you because I think in 2020 or something,

2928
02:12:48,200 --> 02:12:52,320
you were more of a socialist and we had had to get back and forth on Twitter.

2929
02:12:52,800 --> 02:12:55,840
Yeah, I know exactly what the back and forth was because like

2930
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:59,160
I didn't know who the fuck you were, but you posted about like selling your website.

2931
02:12:59,160 --> 02:13:02,840
I was like, I should I should buy the I should buy the

2932
02:13:03,520 --> 02:13:06,680
domain name and have it linked back to my Twitch channel.

2933
02:13:07,400 --> 02:13:10,040
So I don't think I was it to sell in 2020.

2934
02:13:10,800 --> 02:13:13,520
Was it not that because that's the only time I've ever

2935
02:13:14,400 --> 02:13:17,840
in that's the only like thing that I remember interacting with you on.

2936
02:13:17,840 --> 02:13:20,280
But keep in mind, I've gone through like

2937
02:13:20,600 --> 02:13:22,680
I go through a new Twitter account every six months or so.

2938
02:13:22,680 --> 02:13:23,760
I always get banned.

2939
02:13:23,760 --> 02:13:26,080
Well, so it

2940
02:13:27,240 --> 02:13:30,320
yeah, no, it was definitely it was definitely something very socialist, though.

2941
02:13:30,320 --> 02:13:33,800
And I was like, oh, yeah, I've probably said some really fucking retarded shit on Twitter.

2942
02:13:33,800 --> 02:13:38,520
And but yeah, I've moved on.

2943
02:13:38,520 --> 02:13:41,720
I've grown as a person, as a political thinker, you know.

2944
02:13:42,240 --> 02:13:45,000
So, yeah, you've cucked out to the system.

2945
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:47,240
You're not a true revolutionary anymore.

2946
02:13:47,240 --> 02:13:50,320
Yeah. No, you see, like as you get older, you

2947
02:13:50,600 --> 02:13:53,440
you start getting comfortable with all the things that the system gives you.

2948
02:13:53,440 --> 02:13:57,080
And then that's the only reason that I've gotten to this point is because I'm

2949
02:13:57,520 --> 02:14:01,840
exploiting the the proletariat with all my bourgeois money

2950
02:14:01,840 --> 02:14:05,600
that I'm making off of my YouTube, getting me sixty dollars a month. So

2951
02:14:08,520 --> 02:14:10,600
fuck. Oh, man.

2952
02:14:10,600 --> 02:14:13,560
So have you seen that that Trotsky bit about

2953
02:14:14,880 --> 02:14:19,400
small businessmen, small business owners being being fascists?

2954
02:14:20,480 --> 02:14:21,840
I have not.

2955
02:14:21,840 --> 02:14:24,680
I never got like so deep into socialism that I knew like

2956
02:14:24,960 --> 02:14:28,080
all of the different like thinkers positions on things.

2957
02:14:28,280 --> 02:14:34,000
I think that my that I was like a total vosh

2958
02:14:34,360 --> 02:14:38,480
brained, you know, market socialist for the longest time.

2959
02:14:39,280 --> 02:14:42,920
I just liked things that sounded nice to like the the most amount of people.

2960
02:14:43,520 --> 02:14:48,480
But then I started getting like as I started getting bigger on stream,

2961
02:14:49,600 --> 02:14:51,840
I started getting into conversations with people that were like

2962
02:14:52,840 --> 02:14:54,640
more and more difficult to argue against.

2963
02:14:54,640 --> 02:14:58,520
And as like those arguments started, like

2964
02:14:59,160 --> 02:15:01,920
I started getting blown the fuck out, especially like capitalism

2965
02:15:01,920 --> 02:15:06,360
versus socialism debates, because I didn't know anything about capitalism.

2966
02:15:06,360 --> 02:15:11,960
I had to do like more research into like specifically it was economics

2967
02:15:11,960 --> 02:15:15,920
and philosophy that those two topics

2968
02:15:16,720 --> 02:15:20,120
made me like understand like, oh, I can't do this.

2969
02:15:20,120 --> 02:15:22,440
Socialism stuff like I can't like

2970
02:15:24,160 --> 02:15:27,400
I have no basis for any of the things that I'm saying.

2971
02:15:27,400 --> 02:15:29,080
Like, I don't believe any of these things.

2972
02:15:29,080 --> 02:15:31,760
I didn't realize that this is what I was like talking about, you know?

2973
02:15:32,600 --> 02:15:36,240
Yeah. And yeah, I don't like market socialism.

2974
02:15:36,240 --> 02:15:39,680
Is is that philosophy that I know a lot of socialists

2975
02:15:39,680 --> 02:15:42,960
want to use market socialism just to back a door in like further

2976
02:15:43,240 --> 02:15:45,120
more crazy variants of socialism.

2977
02:15:45,120 --> 02:15:49,080
But even markets like it sounds it sounds good to the normies,

2978
02:15:49,080 --> 02:15:50,560
but it still doesn't work.

2979
02:15:50,560 --> 02:15:52,560
You know, it still just falls apart.

2980
02:15:53,600 --> 02:15:55,960
And, you know, the idea that, OK, you have a government

2981
02:15:56,160 --> 02:16:00,400
and the government is going to legally mandate that all businesses be worker

2982
02:16:00,400 --> 02:16:03,200
co-ops is the most basic form of market socialism, right?

2983
02:16:03,600 --> 02:16:07,600
So that doesn't actually work, because like, how do you expand a business?

2984
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:10,520
Well, you don't because all the money is going to is being cut up,

2985
02:16:10,520 --> 02:16:14,520
like all the profits just being being divided up and given to workers. Right.

2986
02:16:14,800 --> 02:16:17,640
There's no extra profit to put into expansion of the business.

2987
02:16:18,160 --> 02:16:19,000
You can take a loan out.

2988
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:22,600
OK, well, now the bank that you've loaned the money from,

2989
02:16:22,920 --> 02:16:24,960
they're going to want interest on their loan.

2990
02:16:24,960 --> 02:16:28,600
So now you're still going to be extracting some of the profit from the workers.

2991
02:16:28,600 --> 02:16:30,800
But instead of giving it to an owner, you're giving it to a bank.

2992
02:16:30,840 --> 02:16:35,560
Well, that bank in their argument would be a locally owned

2993
02:16:35,560 --> 02:16:38,800
like co-op that is not based

2994
02:16:39,400 --> 02:16:42,480
owned by either the government or by a private firm.

2995
02:16:42,680 --> 02:16:46,440
It would be a co-op of people in the community

2996
02:16:46,440 --> 02:16:49,600
that are looking to invest in a particular item.

2997
02:16:50,200 --> 02:16:53,080
So interest really, it's still extractive, though.

2998
02:16:53,120 --> 02:16:55,560
I mean, there's still the interest and it would still be extractive.

2999
02:16:55,720 --> 02:16:57,320
It doesn't work. It doesn't work.

3000
02:16:57,320 --> 02:16:59,000
Yeah, no, it's it's really dumb.

3001
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:01,920
And like the the market socialists that I've argued with

3002
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:05,440
since I've like moved into liberalism,

3003
02:17:06,040 --> 02:17:10,120
it feels like they're just kind of recreating capitalism,

3004
02:17:10,240 --> 02:17:14,240
but they don't want to call it capitalism and they don't want there to be like

3005
02:17:14,800 --> 02:17:17,040
like an individual owning a company.

3006
02:17:17,320 --> 02:17:19,440
And it's just a yeah. Yeah.

3007
02:17:20,880 --> 02:17:25,360
So with with Trotsky, his his view was that something like

3008
02:17:26,240 --> 02:17:28,080
a member of the working class

3009
02:17:28,080 --> 02:17:31,640
who has managed to work his way up to the point that he owns his own business.

3010
02:17:31,640 --> 02:17:34,880
He owns a small shop or he owns some kind of some kind of small business

3011
02:17:34,880 --> 02:17:37,440
that he that he he owns it, but he also works in it.

3012
02:17:37,440 --> 02:17:39,400
So he's both an owner and a laborer.

3013
02:17:40,800 --> 02:17:44,560
This person will always side against a socialist revolution

3014
02:17:44,560 --> 02:17:48,640
and therefore always with the fascists, because all non socialists

3015
02:17:48,640 --> 02:17:50,960
are fascists in the end, you know how it is. But.

3016
02:17:51,960 --> 02:17:56,200
But basically, this the small business owner, despite,

3017
02:17:56,200 --> 02:17:59,560
you know, literally being a worker who owns the means of production,

3018
02:17:59,920 --> 02:18:02,560
will always side against a socialist revolution

3019
02:18:02,560 --> 02:18:06,600
because he has built the means of production with his own labor.

3020
02:18:07,040 --> 02:18:11,360
And so he wants to keep the power structure in place that protects it

3021
02:18:12,040 --> 02:18:14,560
rather than rather than being part of a revolution

3022
02:18:14,560 --> 02:18:16,880
that seizes the means of production from someone else.

3023
02:18:17,400 --> 02:18:21,680
So if you are someone who who creates your own stuff,

3024
02:18:22,080 --> 02:18:26,000
there's always going to be, in Trotsky's view, an anti socialist streak in you

3025
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:27,640
and you're always going to be the enemy.

3026
02:18:27,640 --> 02:18:30,800
And if you take that point of view to its natural conclusion,

3027
02:18:31,040 --> 02:18:35,400
that literally means that all socialists have to be like

3028
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:38,320
literally the lowest common denominator of person.

3029
02:18:38,520 --> 02:18:39,680
They can't be creative.

3030
02:18:39,680 --> 02:18:41,720
They can't be hard working. They can't be innovative.

3031
02:18:42,120 --> 02:18:45,160
They they just have to be the ones who sees

3032
02:18:45,320 --> 02:18:47,680
what greater men have built.

3033
02:18:47,680 --> 02:18:51,960
And it's like, well, I don't know if this is the line of logic

3034
02:18:51,960 --> 02:18:54,720
you want to go down. It doesn't look very good. Yeah.

3035
02:18:55,480 --> 02:18:59,200
Yeah. I remember on my way out of there, I

3036
02:19:00,040 --> 02:19:02,680
he he won't watch anything on YouTube.

3037
02:19:02,720 --> 02:19:05,280
My one of my old head mods.

3038
02:19:05,280 --> 02:19:06,840
So F to Internet gas.

3039
02:19:06,840 --> 02:19:12,200
But he lives in like Romania or some shit, some ex-Soviet state. And

3040
02:19:13,200 --> 02:19:15,360
it I was like trying so hard.

3041
02:19:15,360 --> 02:19:18,240
I remember like there was there was

3042
02:19:19,480 --> 02:19:21,040
I can remember exactly what I was.

3043
02:19:21,040 --> 02:19:23,960
We were playing fucking Half-Life two and we were watching

3044
02:19:26,160 --> 02:19:29,360
documentaries about like Soviet style, like

3045
02:19:30,600 --> 02:19:33,040
economics and like history.

3046
02:19:33,200 --> 02:19:35,200
And I was like bending over backwards.

3047
02:19:35,200 --> 02:19:37,840
And like when it was pointed out to me, I was bending over backwards

3048
02:19:37,840 --> 02:19:41,840
to try and defend what was going on in Soviet Russia.

3049
02:19:41,840 --> 02:19:43,640
I was like, oh, this is so fucked.

3050
02:19:43,640 --> 02:19:45,000
Like, why am I doing this?

3051
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:46,920
I just I need to learn.

3052
02:19:46,920 --> 02:19:48,240
And this is like one of the big lessons

3053
02:19:48,240 --> 02:19:51,640
I've learned since I've started streaming, like learn to just like take an L

3054
02:19:51,640 --> 02:19:55,760
and like figure out like when you're wrong and just like

3055
02:19:55,760 --> 02:19:59,400
accept that you were wrong and then like fix your position accordingly.

3056
02:19:59,720 --> 02:20:01,800
Right. Yeah. It's just.

3057
02:20:02,960 --> 02:20:05,560
And there is there is an inverse less past that

3058
02:20:06,400 --> 02:20:09,360
there's an inverse lesson, though, because my audience

3059
02:20:09,600 --> 02:20:11,320
was way more right leaning than me.

3060
02:20:11,320 --> 02:20:13,600
And for example, we disagree on whether or not

3061
02:20:14,040 --> 02:20:16,520
the 2020 election was rigged or not. Right. Right.

3062
02:20:16,880 --> 02:20:18,880
They they tend to think that it was.

3063
02:20:18,880 --> 02:20:20,840
I don't think that it was.

3064
02:20:20,840 --> 02:20:24,960
However, the issue is, is that if we're going just by like

3065
02:20:25,400 --> 02:20:29,280
popularity and feedback, I should be taking an L from them.

3066
02:20:29,280 --> 02:20:30,320
But I don't. All right.

3067
02:20:30,320 --> 02:20:31,800
I don't I don't give them that one.

3068
02:20:31,800 --> 02:20:35,480
I say, even though there's not be 500 of you in my stream

3069
02:20:35,480 --> 02:20:38,400
chat saying that I'm wrong, I'll be like, no, I think I'm correct on this one.

3070
02:20:38,720 --> 02:20:40,560
So sometimes you also have to learn

3071
02:20:40,560 --> 02:20:45,680
when to go against the popular criticism of you and say, hold on.

3072
02:20:45,680 --> 02:20:48,520
I don't think that even though it's popular, I don't think it's correct.

3073
02:20:48,800 --> 02:20:51,320
That's that's like something something that streamers also have to learn, too.

3074
02:20:51,640 --> 02:20:54,440
Yeah, no, for sure. And that was

3075
02:20:54,440 --> 02:20:56,560
someone asked how many of my friends have I lost since,

3076
02:20:57,080 --> 02:20:58,880
like, stop being a socialist.

3077
02:20:58,880 --> 02:21:03,280
It's like I probably like 90 percent of the people that I used to talk to

3078
02:21:03,280 --> 02:21:07,960
or were friends with, I'm no longer have contact with

3079
02:21:07,960 --> 02:21:12,440
because it's either a really bad optically for them to have me on stream

3080
02:21:12,440 --> 02:21:15,600
and like shitpost around because I've gotten to so many arguments

3081
02:21:15,600 --> 02:21:20,000
with lefties online and like the the more arguments I get into

3082
02:21:20,320 --> 02:21:24,160
with these people, like the the meaner I get, because it just

3083
02:21:24,400 --> 02:21:27,640
I get frustrated and say meaner and meaner things.

3084
02:21:27,840 --> 02:21:31,600
But like I've probably lost like 90 percent of my professional contacts

3085
02:21:31,600 --> 02:21:35,360
over the course of like streaming because of like.

3086
02:21:36,360 --> 02:21:37,880
Just who have you lost?

3087
02:21:37,880 --> 02:21:39,080
Like what's that?

3088
02:21:39,080 --> 02:21:42,480
I like I think me and shark three or zero are still cool,

3089
02:21:42,480 --> 02:21:45,120
but like I don't really like talk to him very much anymore,

3090
02:21:45,120 --> 02:21:46,520
even though like we used to be on each other's streams,

3091
02:21:46,520 --> 02:21:48,680
like almost all the fucking time.

3092
02:21:48,680 --> 02:21:52,280
A lot of people who have like dropped off and like stop streaming.

3093
02:21:53,560 --> 02:21:56,600
There is this one guy named Growl God.

3094
02:21:56,600 --> 02:22:00,000
I used to like be in the like Vasht sphere

3095
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:02,120
and Vasht had come on my stream a couple of times

3096
02:22:02,120 --> 02:22:09,120
and like the like all the like smaller orbiters around that,

3097
02:22:09,320 --> 02:22:12,120
like demon mama and doe and people like that.

3098
02:22:13,120 --> 02:22:15,040
Who are the fucking insaneoids?

3099
02:22:15,040 --> 02:22:18,200
Yeah. Who I tried to like be like ultra charitable to,

3100
02:22:18,200 --> 02:22:20,600
even though like their position was completely untenable.

3101
02:22:21,240 --> 02:22:24,080
And like the second that you go against them, like it's like

3102
02:22:24,080 --> 02:22:26,920
you're literally a fascist now and you need to die.

3103
02:22:27,920 --> 02:22:31,720
So like most of the people like surrounding Vasht

3104
02:22:31,720 --> 02:22:34,600
are like the people that I had professional contact with

3105
02:22:34,600 --> 02:22:39,160
and like friendships with and like lost almost all of that,

3106
02:22:39,160 --> 02:22:44,600
like possible growth from the lefty crowd there, because just

3107
02:22:45,960 --> 02:22:48,880
either because like I've had a public disagreement with them

3108
02:22:49,040 --> 02:22:55,080
or because it's just like so like in terms of like Vasht viewers

3109
02:22:55,080 --> 02:22:59,000
and like people in the space that at least somewhat agree with Vasht.

3110
02:22:59,200 --> 02:23:03,120
It's like I'm radioactive because I,

3111
02:23:04,720 --> 02:23:06,320
you know, argued with them too much.

3112
02:23:06,320 --> 02:23:09,120
And they also tried to say that I was a destiny orbiter

3113
02:23:09,120 --> 02:23:12,960
before like I actually ever engaged with him, literally ever.

3114
02:23:13,240 --> 02:23:15,640
So like like that, Vasht does that.

3115
02:23:15,760 --> 02:23:18,640
He does that. He's like, these are destiny style arguments.

3116
02:23:18,680 --> 02:23:20,160
Is he feeding you information?

3117
02:23:20,160 --> 02:23:23,160
Oh, God, that shit is so fucking funny.

3118
02:23:23,480 --> 02:23:24,760
Oh, God. Yeah.

3119
02:23:24,760 --> 02:23:28,520
And see, like like Rosarest is like the last person that you could do that to,

3120
02:23:28,520 --> 02:23:32,880
because he's still like, you know, he I'm pretty sure he is still a socialist.

3121
02:23:32,880 --> 02:23:35,960
Right. But he's just like a there was a sock to him.

3122
02:23:36,840 --> 02:23:38,400
Maybe is a sock to him. I don't know.

3123
02:23:38,400 --> 02:23:41,440
He's made really good arguments for like market socialism

3124
02:23:42,440 --> 02:23:45,960
that like if I were to get into an argument with him about market socialism,

3125
02:23:46,280 --> 02:23:49,400
he would probably crush me just because he knows more about the topic

3126
02:23:49,400 --> 02:23:51,480
of like economics than I do. But.

3127
02:23:53,960 --> 02:23:55,680
Vasht would be nothing like that. Oh, yeah, of course.

3128
02:23:55,680 --> 02:23:59,400
But yeah, I remember like I was like simultaneously

3129
02:23:59,400 --> 02:24:02,920
I was like in this like Venn diagram, like right in the middle

3130
02:24:02,920 --> 02:24:05,120
between like Vasht and destiny viewers.

3131
02:24:05,120 --> 02:24:07,880
But like the second that I started like arguing with people on the left

3132
02:24:07,880 --> 02:24:10,560
for like doing like increasingly fucking crazy things.

3133
02:24:11,240 --> 02:24:13,040
It was just like it was all over.

3134
02:24:13,040 --> 02:24:16,160
Like there was no coming back.

3135
02:24:16,160 --> 02:24:16,960
Like the. Yeah.

3136
02:24:16,960 --> 02:24:19,040
They also just lean into being an orbiter now.

3137
02:24:19,040 --> 02:24:23,640
Just oh, yeah, no, I definitely I have I have leaned into that shit so hard.

3138
02:24:24,480 --> 02:24:28,960
I used to lean into it like way harder back when I was like extra mad

3139
02:24:28,960 --> 02:24:32,960
at the lefties, like like dog piling me

3140
02:24:33,200 --> 02:24:37,120
like the the destiny and couples drama like.

3141
02:24:38,760 --> 02:24:41,160
Oh, my God, couples is a fucking nightmare.

3142
02:24:41,200 --> 02:24:43,720
Yeah, she is so happy she's gone.

3143
02:24:43,960 --> 02:24:46,920
I'm so happy she's dropped off hardcore, although she got a W

3144
02:24:46,920 --> 02:24:50,760
against the poly people person the other day with the Finster drama.

3145
02:24:50,760 --> 02:24:56,640
But I like the the preamble to that started

3146
02:24:56,640 --> 02:25:01,520
because I called out demon mama for like calling destiny like

3147
02:25:02,880 --> 02:25:05,200
or like saying that destiny was hate rating couples.

3148
02:25:05,400 --> 02:25:07,600
And I was like, wait, is there evidence of that?

3149
02:25:07,600 --> 02:25:09,520
And she's like, I don't need to give you evidence.

3150
02:25:09,520 --> 02:25:12,920
So then I like went through and like with the help of like people in my chat

3151
02:25:12,920 --> 02:25:16,320
and like found like all like the screen caps of like

3152
02:25:16,800 --> 02:25:19,920
the like when clips were made of when hate rates were happening

3153
02:25:20,080 --> 02:25:22,360
versus what destiny was doing simultaneously.

3154
02:25:22,360 --> 02:25:25,200
He was like in a in a debate with someone or like playing

3155
02:25:26,280 --> 02:25:28,600
not Dark Souls, the other one, the the more recent one.

3156
02:25:29,120 --> 02:25:33,920
Yeah. And like because I posted that, I got like

3157
02:25:33,920 --> 02:25:36,880
that was probably like the worst fucking hate I've gotten online.

3158
02:25:36,880 --> 02:25:39,520
Holy fucking shit.

3159
02:25:39,520 --> 02:25:41,040
And I wasn't even like home.

3160
02:25:41,040 --> 02:25:44,280
I was like out of state, like visiting my girlfriend's family.

3161
02:25:44,480 --> 02:25:48,520
And it was it was just like really fucking that.

3162
02:25:48,520 --> 02:25:51,320
That's why I like every single

3163
02:25:52,600 --> 02:25:55,400
thing to do with like destiny and couples or destiny.

3164
02:25:55,400 --> 02:25:58,600
And demon mama like since then has like my name has come up

3165
02:25:58,600 --> 02:26:01,680
because the whole like thing started with me

3166
02:26:02,480 --> 02:26:07,560
like going ultra hard on demon mama because she questioned me.

3167
02:26:08,400 --> 02:26:11,400
You know, and

3168
02:26:11,400 --> 02:26:15,440
if you're too radioactive for these people, I definitely am.

3169
02:26:15,680 --> 02:26:18,760
If if they even know who I am, I'm still like reasonably small, right?

3170
02:26:18,760 --> 02:26:19,520
I'm not a huge channel.

3171
02:26:19,520 --> 02:26:21,600
I'm not I'm not I'm not small, but I'm not huge. Right.

3172
02:26:24,200 --> 02:26:29,840
I know at one point, Zandra Hall was pushing very hard to debate me there,

3173
02:26:29,840 --> 02:26:34,840
and I eventually I eventually I'm not much of a debater. Right.

3174
02:26:35,080 --> 02:26:37,440
But I eventually accepted that he vanished.

3175
02:26:37,440 --> 02:26:39,600
I think he didn't want to actually do it.

3176
02:26:39,600 --> 02:26:42,720
And also, I managed to get like Sargon to debate.

3177
02:26:42,720 --> 02:26:43,440
I was like Sargon.

3178
02:26:43,480 --> 02:26:44,960
Hey, then I'll say some things about you.

3179
02:26:44,960 --> 02:26:45,760
Do you want to debate?

3180
02:26:45,760 --> 02:26:47,200
Do you want to debate?

3181
02:26:47,200 --> 02:26:50,080
And so I was like, I'm such an Adam, right?

3182
02:26:51,240 --> 02:26:53,440
No, Chud Logic was going to host it. Oh, shit.

3183
02:26:53,480 --> 02:26:58,000
So Chud Logic was going to was going to moderate between Zandra Hall and Sargon.

3184
02:26:58,440 --> 02:27:00,480
And Chud was down and Chud was trying to set it up.

3185
02:27:00,800 --> 02:27:04,160
And at the same time, Zandra Hall wanted to debate me.

3186
02:27:04,160 --> 02:27:05,440
And I was like, OK, fine.

3187
02:27:05,440 --> 02:27:08,160
And then he just ghosted all of us.

3188
02:27:08,160 --> 02:27:10,400
He just vanished.

3189
02:27:10,400 --> 02:27:12,840
And now he acts like it never fucking happened.

3190
02:27:13,440 --> 02:27:16,040
Yeah. The only time I ever interacted with Zandra Hall, he

3191
02:27:17,320 --> 02:27:21,080
I was talking with Zandra Hall, Shark Three of Zero and Merrick.

3192
02:27:21,280 --> 02:27:24,760
And Zandra Hall just like told a story about him, like coming in his own shorts

3193
02:27:24,760 --> 02:27:29,040
all the time as a teenager because he didn't want to like get caught masturbating.

3194
02:27:29,040 --> 02:27:31,440
And he just like wallowed in the cum.

3195
02:27:31,680 --> 02:27:33,920
And so like, that's the only interaction I've ever had with him.

3196
02:27:33,920 --> 02:27:37,160
So was that on stream or? Yes, it was on stream.

3197
02:27:37,320 --> 02:27:41,920
It was hellish, actually, like him telling the story because it was it was so

3198
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:45,560
there was so much detail about how the kind of just laid on his leg.

3199
02:27:45,560 --> 02:27:47,640
And it was like it went on for way too long.

3200
02:27:47,640 --> 02:27:52,800
And I was like, you don't want to be telling the story. OK, but yeah.

3201
02:27:53,280 --> 02:27:57,600
Merrick is somebody else that I've been like kind of friendly with over the years,

3202
02:27:57,600 --> 02:27:59,440
but not really, not anymore.

3203
02:27:59,440 --> 02:28:00,560
That's kind of kind of ended.

3204
02:28:00,560 --> 02:28:03,080
I think that's what happened with me, because I like

3205
02:28:04,640 --> 02:28:08,160
there was like, you know, the better discourse debates that Destiny's gone on.

3206
02:28:08,200 --> 02:28:11,680
He like argued with the Nico House guy.

3207
02:28:11,960 --> 02:28:15,480
About like Google owning everything.

3208
02:28:15,480 --> 02:28:17,360
I don't think I know this one. No, no.

3209
02:28:17,360 --> 02:28:19,000
It's like an event that happens in Dallas.

3210
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:22,560
And I had gone to that in me, a shark, zero shark

3211
02:28:23,960 --> 02:28:27,560
socialism done left in Merrick, all roomed in an Airbnb together.

3212
02:28:27,720 --> 02:28:30,400
So I really like and I really like Merrick. Right.

3213
02:28:31,000 --> 02:28:33,840
And there were like really, really great people in person.

3214
02:28:34,040 --> 02:28:38,600
But like the online like discourse with these people are not still

3215
02:28:38,600 --> 02:28:40,960
SEO is like really, really chill.

3216
02:28:40,960 --> 02:28:47,520
But Merrick is online is way different than Merrick IRL.

3217
02:28:48,360 --> 02:28:51,600
Both of their policy prescriptions seem to be fucking insane.

3218
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:55,320
Like nothing about how cool they are as people, but like their ideas.

3219
02:28:55,320 --> 02:28:56,960
Yeah, that's for both of them.

3220
02:28:56,960 --> 02:28:59,800
Like they're just holy fuck.

3221
02:29:00,360 --> 02:29:05,720
With Merrick, the last time I talked to her, I was basically I was steel

3222
02:29:05,720 --> 02:29:11,200
manning Destiny's position of replatforming Nick Fuentes, saying, listen.

3223
02:29:12,520 --> 02:29:15,800
Regardless, the point that Destiny seemed to be making was that,

3224
02:29:15,800 --> 02:29:19,440
one, it had been a long time, he didn't know if Nick Fuentes was was so extreme.

3225
02:29:19,680 --> 02:29:21,360
He was like 18 back in the day.

3226
02:29:21,360 --> 02:29:23,440
Now he's like 24 people's opinions change.

3227
02:29:23,440 --> 02:29:24,760
That's a long time.

3228
02:29:24,760 --> 02:29:28,640
And in a in a especially transformative period of your life,

3229
02:29:28,840 --> 02:29:30,760
maybe he's not as extreme as he used to be.

3230
02:29:30,760 --> 02:29:33,080
And two, I think this was the better argument.

3231
02:29:34,080 --> 02:29:38,720
Is that. It doesn't matter if Nick Fuentes is a fascist

3232
02:29:38,720 --> 02:29:41,440
or some other kind of, you know, insane ideology,

3233
02:29:41,760 --> 02:29:43,920
because the conversations are more interesting.

3234
02:29:43,960 --> 02:29:47,960
Nobody is talking about this stuff, so let's talk about the actual ideas

3235
02:29:47,960 --> 02:29:50,920
and forget about like, OK, you're a fascist, therefore you're evil, you know?

3236
02:29:51,440 --> 02:29:54,840
And I think those are actually two pretty good, pretty good reasons

3237
02:29:54,840 --> 02:29:57,840
as to why Destiny should have kept talking to Nick Fuentes

3238
02:29:57,840 --> 02:29:59,960
or at least should have started talking to him again.

3239
02:30:00,200 --> 02:30:01,400
Like that's fine.

3240
02:30:01,440 --> 02:30:02,360
I don't think like.

3241
02:30:02,360 --> 02:30:05,880
But she was going, no, Nick Fuentes is way too smart for Destiny.

3242
02:30:05,960 --> 02:30:07,840
He's way too smart for you.

3243
02:30:07,840 --> 02:30:11,440
He's going to fucking he's going to like convert everyone's audience

3244
02:30:11,440 --> 02:30:13,000
and you're all too stupid to know it.

3245
02:30:13,000 --> 02:30:14,640
And I was like, Merrick.

3246
02:30:14,920 --> 02:30:17,600
Is he is he too smart for you?

3247
02:30:18,080 --> 02:30:21,440
And she was like, no, no, I'm the only one who could outthink him.

3248
02:30:21,600 --> 02:30:22,720
And I'm like, why don't you talk to him?

3249
02:30:22,720 --> 02:30:25,760
Then, you know, and she like she just took off after that.

3250
02:30:25,760 --> 02:30:27,400
She wouldn't she wouldn't reply to that, right?

3251
02:30:27,400 --> 02:30:29,840
Yeah, I feel like.

3252
02:30:30,520 --> 02:30:34,400
There were there were some like critiques, like I felt like the like getting

3253
02:30:34,680 --> 02:30:38,040
getting dinner and like streaming that with Fuentes was like weird.

3254
02:30:38,040 --> 02:30:39,760
But like, I don't think I can tell.

3255
02:30:39,760 --> 02:30:42,960
Yeah, I don't feel like I can tell people who they can and can't

3256
02:30:43,000 --> 02:30:45,920
like do content with, so like I never really.

3257
02:30:49,040 --> 02:30:50,560
You know, I never really like went hard

3258
02:30:50,560 --> 02:30:53,000
into like saying Destiny should or shouldn't be

3259
02:30:54,320 --> 02:30:56,920
talking to him, you know,

3260
02:30:56,920 --> 02:31:00,240
but I, I have a good answer for that.

3261
02:31:00,240 --> 02:31:02,280
I have a really good answer for that.

3262
02:31:02,280 --> 02:31:07,560
I don't view it as my obligation to actually make the world better.

3263
02:31:08,480 --> 02:31:11,720
It'd be good if I did, but I'm not required to.

3264
02:31:11,720 --> 02:31:14,640
If I want to chill and hang out with someone who,

3265
02:31:14,920 --> 02:31:18,560
you know, even though he has really strange radical politics

3266
02:31:18,800 --> 02:31:20,960
in a nonpolitical way, he's a nice guy.

3267
02:31:20,960 --> 02:31:22,200
If I want to do that, I can do that.

3268
02:31:22,200 --> 02:31:23,800
You know, I can fucking do that.

3269
02:31:23,800 --> 02:31:26,680
I am under no obligation to platform anyone

3270
02:31:26,840 --> 02:31:30,880
or not platform anyone based on anybody else's moral intuitions.

3271
02:31:30,880 --> 02:31:33,040
I don't care about any of that shit.

3272
02:31:33,040 --> 02:31:35,400
The whole shouldn't you use your platform to be more?

3273
02:31:35,520 --> 02:31:38,200
No, I shouldn't. No, absolutely not.

3274
02:31:38,560 --> 02:31:39,720
I completely reject that logic.

3275
02:31:41,520 --> 02:31:44,280
Yeah, I don't like necessarily disagree.

3276
02:31:44,280 --> 02:31:47,400
Vash would call that super augatory.

3277
02:31:47,400 --> 02:31:49,640
But the God

3278
02:31:49,640 --> 02:31:52,040
I feel like when it comes to Fuentes,

3279
02:31:52,040 --> 02:31:55,400
I lost so much respect for him, like intellectually.

3280
02:31:55,400 --> 02:31:58,000
Like he used to be like a really scary person

3281
02:31:59,240 --> 02:32:02,080
just like because it was like ideology and shit, because like it's

3282
02:32:02,680 --> 02:32:05,320
like I do find like the

3283
02:32:05,320 --> 02:32:09,320
this might be a brave take, but I find like the Nazi stuff to be really disgusting.

3284
02:32:10,160 --> 02:32:12,280
But like a good job.

3285
02:32:12,280 --> 02:32:16,920
Yeah, good job with all the Kino casino fucking like cat boy

3286
02:32:16,920 --> 02:32:20,840
come hunting shit that he did with the America first people.

3287
02:32:21,040 --> 02:32:23,240
He's just like a fucking goon.

3288
02:32:23,240 --> 02:32:25,520
I'm not really I don't really see him as like a

3289
02:32:26,480 --> 02:32:28,920
super like spooky person as much anymore, you know?

3290
02:32:30,480 --> 02:32:32,720
Yeah, yeah, I completely agree with you.

3291
02:32:32,760 --> 02:32:34,560
I completely agree with you.

3292
02:32:35,720 --> 02:32:38,000
And if we're talking about like actual,

3293
02:32:38,320 --> 02:32:41,480
you know, influential right wing figures,

3294
02:32:41,480 --> 02:32:43,960
I mean, Nick Fuentes is very influential, especially in the United States. Right.

3295
02:32:44,480 --> 02:32:47,800
But he's he's running a political movement

3296
02:32:47,800 --> 02:32:51,000
that will probably fizzle out as he as he gets older. Right.

3297
02:32:51,360 --> 02:32:55,080
It's already gone through several iterations over the course of his online career.

3298
02:32:56,560 --> 02:33:01,520
You know, the epochs of people's life tend to not last more than a decade.

3299
02:33:01,920 --> 02:33:04,200
He'll probably be doing something different in 10 years. Right.

3300
02:33:04,520 --> 02:33:07,120
We all probably will be.

3301
02:33:08,200 --> 02:33:12,800
I'd be super curious to see what like a 30 year old Nick Fuentes is doing,

3302
02:33:12,800 --> 02:33:15,720
like given how fucking radioactive he is. But

3303
02:33:16,720 --> 02:33:17,920
I know I know what you mean.

3304
02:33:17,920 --> 02:33:21,960
Maybe he might he might like morph into an Alex Jones Rush

3305
02:33:21,960 --> 02:33:24,000
Limbaugh kind of a person where he does like radio instead.

3306
02:33:24,560 --> 02:33:25,520
He kind of does that now.

3307
02:33:25,520 --> 02:33:28,240
But he also does like real life activism, you know, but he might like

3308
02:33:28,240 --> 02:33:30,640
he might try to try to try to parlay that into some sort of a show,

3309
02:33:31,200 --> 02:33:33,360
like a grander scale show.

3310
02:33:33,360 --> 02:33:36,960
I do think his numbers are probably kind of inflated over on cozy. Oh, 100%.

3311
02:33:38,680 --> 02:33:42,320
But but no, like, have you have you heard about the act

3312
02:33:42,320 --> 02:33:44,920
like the whole academic agent present Sunday thing?

3313
02:33:46,600 --> 02:33:48,760
I don't know. Oh, wait.

3314
02:33:49,480 --> 02:33:51,600
I vaguely know about this.

3315
02:33:51,800 --> 02:33:55,360
He present Sunday before he like got big into like streaming.

3316
02:33:55,360 --> 02:33:59,400
He like doxed in, contacted academic agents

3317
02:33:59,880 --> 02:34:02,400
workplace, right, and got him fired. Yes.

3318
02:34:02,880 --> 02:34:08,600
He was a university professor in the UK and he got him fired. Jesus.

3319
02:34:09,400 --> 02:34:14,320
Yeah. And now here's here's what he got him fired for.

3320
02:34:14,880 --> 02:34:18,920
Academic agent was like your generic anti SJW YouTuber. Yeah. All right.

3321
02:34:19,440 --> 02:34:21,560
And the UK is pretty extreme when it comes to stuff

3322
02:34:21,560 --> 02:34:24,360
like this compared to compared to North America.

3323
02:34:24,720 --> 02:34:29,520
So he lost his job for daring to make fun of the SJWs in 2014.

3324
02:34:30,760 --> 02:34:34,920
And he this guy, he's like a university professor and he's he's pretty well

3325
02:34:34,920 --> 02:34:36,480
educated, he's pretty well read.

3326
02:34:36,480 --> 02:34:38,040
He's he's very sharp.

3327
02:34:38,040 --> 02:34:41,800
You don't want to debate him, even though I don't think he's correct generally.

3328
02:34:42,160 --> 02:34:46,440
But I do respect him and I do like I have his his his latest book.

3329
02:34:46,920 --> 02:34:51,480
That's something I'll probably be tackling soon, maybe depending on my time. But.

3330
02:34:53,240 --> 02:34:56,520
Even though I don't agree with him, I respect him because he's somebody

3331
02:34:56,520 --> 02:34:59,480
who is well read and he's well educated and he can he can write.

3332
02:34:59,480 --> 02:35:01,680
He can think he can speak.

3333
02:35:01,680 --> 02:35:05,240
And so this guy who is probably like a very generic conservative

3334
02:35:05,560 --> 02:35:09,960
or he was back in the day now, he's he after after losing his job

3335
02:35:09,960 --> 02:35:12,600
and having to like scrabble together enough money to survive

3336
02:35:12,960 --> 02:35:15,600
and, you know, being being treated by the system

3337
02:35:15,600 --> 02:35:17,800
that he views as being a left leaning system.

3338
02:35:17,800 --> 02:35:22,400
He's he's like a full, hardcore neo reactionary. Right. Right.

3339
02:35:22,400 --> 02:35:25,600
And now he's writing now he's writing political theory for the neo

3340
02:35:25,600 --> 02:35:29,720
reactionary camp, you know, and it's like Jesus. All right.

3341
02:35:30,360 --> 02:35:34,120
I don't know what you necessarily accomplished by getting this guy canceled

3342
02:35:34,120 --> 02:35:36,160
other than radicalizing him.

3343
02:35:36,160 --> 02:35:38,680
And he's also capable of of of writing,

3344
02:35:39,080 --> 02:35:41,840
you know, scathing political theory for your enemies.

3345
02:35:41,840 --> 02:35:44,720
So you've you've made things worse President Sunday.

3346
02:35:44,760 --> 02:35:48,120
I feel like it's the obvious like conclusion.

3347
02:35:48,120 --> 02:35:51,640
If you're going to like drive people out of like the like general

3348
02:35:51,640 --> 02:35:54,640
like spaces where everybody talks,

3349
02:35:54,640 --> 02:35:57,080
then you're going to push them into like spaces

3350
02:35:57,080 --> 02:36:01,760
where only like certain opinions are are accepted. Right.

3351
02:36:01,920 --> 02:36:05,280
And even if that person is like relatively like center,

3352
02:36:05,560 --> 02:36:09,400
like, you know, center leaning towards their politics,

3353
02:36:09,400 --> 02:36:11,520
maybe they're a little bit rightly, maybe they're a little bit leftly,

3354
02:36:11,520 --> 02:36:13,680
but they're relatively centrist. Right.

3355
02:36:13,680 --> 02:36:17,320
If you if you push it to where they only ever get to interact with people

3356
02:36:17,320 --> 02:36:20,280
that are like super far left or super far right, then

3357
02:36:21,200 --> 02:36:23,880
where do you think their positions are going to end up? You know?

3358
02:36:25,320 --> 02:36:27,480
Yeah, it's and it's not just that.

3359
02:36:27,480 --> 02:36:33,080
It's also I think academic agent really took like he got down.

3360
02:36:33,400 --> 02:36:37,040
Like you got like trampled by the system after he got fired

3361
02:36:37,400 --> 02:36:40,360
and he viewed it as a left leaning system, and that was a lot of it, too.

3362
02:36:40,640 --> 02:36:42,880
It's like so there's there's this theory on the right.

3363
02:36:43,280 --> 02:36:45,400
And I think it holds some some weight.

3364
02:36:45,400 --> 02:36:48,720
And it's this it's basically they call it

3365
02:36:50,080 --> 02:36:52,520
the best way to describe it is tyranny by red tape.

3366
02:36:53,440 --> 02:36:56,920
So the idea is that government can become so big

3367
02:36:56,920 --> 02:36:59,520
and so bloated and so bureaucratic

3368
02:37:00,120 --> 02:37:04,720
that you never even know when you're doing something wrong.

3369
02:37:04,720 --> 02:37:08,120
You know, the the common stereotype is if you walk down to the store,

3370
02:37:08,120 --> 02:37:10,200
you can violate a dozen laws and not even know it.

3371
02:37:10,200 --> 02:37:12,320
You know, you hear that story a lot. Yeah, for sure. And.

3372
02:37:13,320 --> 02:37:18,360
And the idea basically is a government that is that expansive can therefore

3373
02:37:18,680 --> 02:37:23,400
choose when to enforce a law and when not to enforce a law.

3374
02:37:23,760 --> 02:37:26,360
So you never know if you're if you're in trouble.

3375
02:37:26,640 --> 02:37:28,560
You never know if you're not in trouble.

3376
02:37:28,560 --> 02:37:32,720
And it might just be the whims of the people involved that you are in trouble,

3377
02:37:32,720 --> 02:37:35,280
you know, because maybe you could jaywalk and then get hit with a fine

3378
02:37:35,280 --> 02:37:37,480
and then the next day do it and then knock it up to get it with a fine,

3379
02:37:37,680 --> 02:37:42,760
depending on who's around what if the officer there likes you, if he doesn't.

3380
02:37:42,960 --> 02:37:47,360
So the way that society is currently structured, according to this view,

3381
02:37:47,360 --> 02:37:52,160
that's pretty common on the right right now, is that it's so it's so expansive

3382
02:37:52,360 --> 02:37:56,840
and also there's not enough resources to implement all of it at all times.

3383
02:37:57,080 --> 02:37:59,760
So it becomes necessarily arbitrary.

3384
02:38:00,080 --> 02:38:07,080
So it's it's it's something like a narco tyranny, if that makes sense. Yeah. Yeah.

3385
02:38:07,160 --> 02:38:10,040
And yeah, it is kind of related to to Franz Kafka's

3386
02:38:10,640 --> 02:38:14,960
Kafka, Kafka esque work, you know, the idea that you have these big

3387
02:38:14,960 --> 02:38:18,440
impersonal bureaucracies that just kind of crush you and there's nothing

3388
02:38:18,440 --> 02:38:21,440
you can do about it because there's no actual person to talk to, you know,

3389
02:38:21,600 --> 02:38:25,240
that like you hear this a lot when you complain, if you call up a business

3390
02:38:25,240 --> 02:38:28,040
and you only get like a phone message and there's no actual real person

3391
02:38:28,040 --> 02:38:30,680
to discuss or things like get a person.

3392
02:38:30,680 --> 02:38:32,200
They say, well, this isn't my department.

3393
02:38:32,200 --> 02:38:33,320
Talk to this person.

3394
02:38:33,320 --> 02:38:36,040
They say this is my department. They sit you off somewhere else.

3395
02:38:36,600 --> 02:38:38,400
Or this is my this is just store policy.

3396
02:38:38,400 --> 02:38:39,360
We can't do anything about it.

3397
02:38:39,360 --> 02:38:42,680
Like when you've hit a stone wall where it seems like

3398
02:38:42,680 --> 02:38:45,600
there's no actual way that being reasonable can help you.

3399
02:38:45,920 --> 02:38:48,320
You know, this this this is the tyranny of red tape.

3400
02:38:50,160 --> 02:38:54,480
And right wing people who talk about this, they pin a lot of it on the left

3401
02:38:54,640 --> 02:38:56,120
because someone in the chat mentions H.R.

3402
02:38:56,120 --> 02:38:57,120
departments, H.R.

3403
02:38:57,120 --> 02:39:00,160
departments are overwhelmingly run by left leaning people.

3404
02:39:00,400 --> 02:39:02,640
You know, a lot a lot of these standards are

3405
02:39:03,120 --> 02:39:05,840
overwhelmingly implemented by left leaning people in government.

3406
02:39:06,160 --> 02:39:09,520
So the right views the tyranny of red tape

3407
02:39:09,520 --> 02:39:12,480
as being a natural byproduct of leftist policy.

3408
02:39:13,360 --> 02:39:16,760
Yeah, I've heard a lot of like right wing critiques of the right wing

3409
02:39:16,760 --> 02:39:20,520
saying that they they kind of ceded so much cultural ground

3410
02:39:20,520 --> 02:39:23,640
to the to the left in so many different areas, whether it's

3411
02:39:24,240 --> 02:39:26,800
bureaucracy or whether it's,

3412
02:39:26,800 --> 02:39:29,360
you know, like everyone went into like financial systems

3413
02:39:29,360 --> 02:39:33,000
or into oil or some shit like that on the right that they built out

3414
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:34,360
all these things there.

3415
02:39:34,360 --> 02:39:38,560
But like when it came to like Hollywood or when it came to like online stuff

3416
02:39:38,560 --> 02:39:40,520
or when it came to,

3417
02:39:40,520 --> 02:39:42,120
like you're saying, like H.R.

3418
02:39:42,120 --> 02:39:46,760
like psychology or basically anything there, philosophy, academia,

3419
02:39:47,920 --> 02:39:51,640
because they didn't like build out anybody like going into these areas

3420
02:39:51,640 --> 02:39:53,160
because they weren't seen as important.

3421
02:39:53,160 --> 02:39:56,600
Now it's all dominated by the left and it's really hard to get a foothold

3422
02:39:56,600 --> 02:40:00,520
because there's so much like a social pressure and like

3423
02:40:01,040 --> 02:40:08,040
inter like profession pressure to be within that head space

3424
02:40:08,040 --> 02:40:12,760
or like political space that like people that are right wing in those areas

3425
02:40:12,760 --> 02:40:15,760
end up like burning out or like just,

3426
02:40:16,680 --> 02:40:18,720
you know, not going into it at all, you know?

3427
02:40:19,680 --> 02:40:23,040
Yeah. And there's actually also an inverse effect, too.

3428
02:40:23,480 --> 02:40:26,680
And here's a great way so I can describe it. So.

3429
02:40:29,480 --> 02:40:32,040
If you want to become, hold on,

3430
02:40:32,480 --> 02:40:35,800
maybe I can find the video so I can show you exactly what I mean, OK?

3431
02:40:37,680 --> 02:40:38,880
Give me just a second.

3432
02:40:38,880 --> 02:40:41,680
After this video, I'm probably going to have to log off, by the way.

3433
02:40:41,880 --> 02:40:42,840
I've been streaming for all my time.

3434
02:40:42,840 --> 02:40:45,520
I mean, it's it's it is it is 10 p.m. for me.

3435
02:40:45,520 --> 02:40:48,320
I'll have to go in a few minutes, too.

3436
02:40:49,800 --> 02:40:52,120
OK, so I'll give you a video,

3437
02:40:52,120 --> 02:40:55,120
I'll give you the explanation of the theory, and then we can we can call it.

3438
02:40:55,520 --> 02:40:57,800
All right. It's a minute long. So just check this out. All right.

3439
02:41:02,040 --> 02:41:04,280
OK, so check out what this guy is doing, right?

3440
02:41:04,280 --> 02:41:06,360
I think this is the correct. Yes, it is. This is the correct video.

3441
02:41:06,800 --> 02:41:11,960
So this is a guy who's been a professional drywaller for 30 years,

3442
02:41:11,960 --> 02:41:16,280
and he's specialized exclusively in how to put up drywall

3443
02:41:16,600 --> 02:41:19,040
and like look at how he does his work right.

3444
02:41:19,280 --> 02:41:20,760
He doesn't need to measure.

3445
02:41:20,760 --> 02:41:22,640
He just he knows exactly where to cut.

3446
02:41:22,640 --> 02:41:24,240
You know exactly how to cut.

3447
02:41:24,240 --> 02:41:26,440
You can put in nails in one hammer.

3448
02:41:26,640 --> 02:41:28,640
You can slice these sheets, no problem.

3449
02:41:28,640 --> 02:41:31,840
Like this is this is like an unparalleled level of skill.

3450
02:41:31,960 --> 02:41:34,160
Yeah. Right. To do the to do the job like this.

3451
02:41:35,640 --> 02:41:37,960
And the thing is,

3452
02:41:37,960 --> 02:41:43,120
is that you can't learn this type of skill by reading a book on drywall.

3453
02:41:43,640 --> 02:41:46,320
It doesn't matter how many books on drywall that you read,

3454
02:41:46,320 --> 02:41:48,400
you'll never become as skilled solely by reading books.

3455
02:41:48,640 --> 02:41:51,280
Reading can help, but you have to do it

3456
02:41:52,120 --> 02:41:54,320
to become this good at something, right?

3457
02:41:54,320 --> 02:41:57,520
So there's a conservative political philosopher.

3458
02:41:57,880 --> 02:42:00,760
There's I think it's Michael Oakshot.

3459
02:42:00,760 --> 02:42:03,600
I think that's his name, Michael Oakshot.

3460
02:42:05,120 --> 02:42:07,800
Yes, Michael Oakshot, and he had a theory

3461
02:42:08,360 --> 02:42:15,000
and his theory is that knowledge can be split into two different things.

3462
02:42:15,560 --> 02:42:18,080
So you have intellectual knowledge,

3463
02:42:18,080 --> 02:42:22,320
which is the rational knowledge, reasonable knowledge, minded knowledge.

3464
02:42:22,640 --> 02:42:24,160
This is the stuff that you can write down.

3465
02:42:24,160 --> 02:42:25,760
This is theory. All right.

3466
02:42:25,760 --> 02:42:28,480
And then you have embodied knowledge.

3467
02:42:29,040 --> 02:42:33,160
And that is what you learn by actively practicing and doing a thing.

3468
02:42:33,480 --> 02:42:37,040
And you can't express embodied knowledge through theory.

3469
02:42:38,080 --> 02:42:41,160
So this is and this is something that, in his opinion,

3470
02:42:41,360 --> 02:42:44,080
the left has completely abandoned.

3471
02:42:45,080 --> 02:42:48,320
Is the practice of these sorts of things and getting knowledge

3472
02:42:48,320 --> 02:42:51,880
through doing rather than through academic means.

3473
02:42:51,880 --> 02:42:56,160
Yeah. And so, you know, you have a lot of leftists who who think that studying

3474
02:42:56,160 --> 02:43:00,920
should be very academic and and a lot of writing, a lot of theorizing,

3475
02:43:00,920 --> 02:43:04,520
a lot of thinking and almost no actual practice. That's that's why.

3476
02:43:04,640 --> 02:43:07,120
And in fact, you can see this in some of the conversations they have.

3477
02:43:07,360 --> 02:43:10,240
They'll say, well, that didn't that, you know, that wasn't real socialism.

3478
02:43:10,240 --> 02:43:12,120
Well, why not? Well, this is what Marx actually wrote.

3479
02:43:12,120 --> 02:43:13,080
It's like, well, hold on.

3480
02:43:13,080 --> 02:43:16,120
You can't rely on the theory if the practice is different, right?

3481
02:43:16,120 --> 02:43:19,000
They completely abandon the practice part of the thing.

3482
02:43:19,360 --> 02:43:22,480
Yes. So in the chat says you can't get better motor skills by reading theory.

3483
02:43:22,480 --> 02:43:24,920
Exactly. It's still a form of knowledge.

3484
02:43:24,920 --> 02:43:27,320
It's still stored in your brain like knowledges,

3485
02:43:27,800 --> 02:43:31,520
but it can't be accessed through rationalistic means.

3486
02:43:31,760 --> 02:43:34,600
It's more intuition than reason.

3487
02:43:34,600 --> 02:43:37,800
And fuck, I wish I saved the clip.

3488
02:43:37,800 --> 02:43:38,720
There was a clip there.

3489
02:43:38,720 --> 02:43:42,080
I tuned into one of his streams at one point, and he said something like,

3490
02:43:42,440 --> 02:43:47,480
Intuitional thinking is is the the foundation of fascist thinking.

3491
02:43:47,680 --> 02:43:51,400
And if you and if you ever go off your intuition, ever, you're a fascist

3492
02:43:51,400 --> 02:43:53,440
or like or you're leading into fascist territory.

3493
02:43:53,440 --> 02:43:55,640
And it's like, holy fuck, dude.

3494
02:43:55,640 --> 02:43:58,640
That plays into the fascist talking point that like, like,

3495
02:43:59,240 --> 02:44:01,400
fuck, it's been so long since I've like

3496
02:44:02,520 --> 02:44:05,880
read Genteelay, but

3497
02:44:05,880 --> 02:44:09,600
they they really hate people that like learn for the sake of learning.

3498
02:44:09,600 --> 02:44:12,080
They want they want men of action to like go out there.

3499
02:44:12,080 --> 02:44:15,680
Like, of course, there's going to be some it's like anti-intellectualism,

3500
02:44:15,680 --> 02:44:19,400
but like in a very specific way where they talk about like, oh, well,

3501
02:44:19,960 --> 02:44:24,120
of course, like we need people who are like good at like trigonometry and stuff

3502
02:44:24,120 --> 02:44:27,360
so that so that like we can figure out how to fire shells.

3503
02:44:27,560 --> 02:44:31,840
But like if you never like apply that knowledge, then you're just like learning

3504
02:44:31,840 --> 02:44:32,760
for the sake of learning.

3505
02:44:32,760 --> 02:44:37,040
And this leads to like, you know, weak men and weak societies.

3506
02:44:37,040 --> 02:44:38,800
Right. You have to do stuff. Right.

3507
02:44:39,600 --> 02:44:42,200
Yeah. Which would be embodied if you like look at the 14 points

3508
02:44:42,200 --> 02:44:44,600
like the the cult of action for action's sake.

3509
02:44:44,840 --> 02:44:48,200
But like it goes like so much deeper than the four, 14 points

3510
02:44:48,960 --> 02:44:52,680
because they they don't mean like don't learn anything.

3511
02:44:52,680 --> 02:44:54,680
Lol. Don't learn how to do math.

3512
02:44:54,680 --> 02:44:57,400
They mean like if you do math right.

3513
02:44:57,520 --> 02:45:01,000
Learn how to use that knowledge for the state in some way.

3514
02:45:01,200 --> 02:45:02,880
You know, so. Yeah.

3515
02:45:02,880 --> 02:45:05,800
And the worst part about that is that is that people on the left

3516
02:45:05,800 --> 02:45:09,680
tend to take that position that the fascists held and say,

3517
02:45:10,160 --> 02:45:13,520
therefore, that means the fascists were always irrational all the time.

3518
02:45:14,040 --> 02:45:16,120
It's like, well, no, that's not how that works.

3519
02:45:16,120 --> 02:45:19,320
But you're you're not you're not listening to what they're saying.

3520
02:45:19,320 --> 02:45:22,720
You see, you hear people say fascism is a fundamentally irrational position.

3521
02:45:22,720 --> 02:45:23,920
It's like, well, no, not really.

3522
02:45:23,920 --> 02:45:27,200
You know, they they have they had

3523
02:45:28,360 --> 02:45:32,600
they were at war against reason for solely for reason's sake.

3524
02:45:32,840 --> 02:45:35,040
That's true. But doesn't make them irrational.

3525
02:45:35,040 --> 02:45:39,960
You know, and I do think that there's obviously I'm definitely a golden mean

3526
02:45:40,200 --> 02:45:43,520
type of person when it comes to a lot of the things that I try to say and do.

3527
02:45:43,800 --> 02:45:47,160
I think that there's obviously a middle ground between theorizing and acting.

3528
02:45:47,160 --> 02:45:49,280
Right. Like you need both of it. You need both of it.

3529
02:45:49,640 --> 02:45:52,800
If you if you live in a in a in a realm of pure theory,

3530
02:45:52,800 --> 02:45:55,800
then you do end up being one of those left leaning elites

3531
02:45:55,800 --> 02:45:58,440
that the right leaning people think exist. You know,

3532
02:46:00,040 --> 02:46:04,120
I don't I don't like a lot of a lot of right wing solutions

3533
02:46:04,160 --> 02:46:05,200
to problems.

3534
02:46:05,200 --> 02:46:07,280
There are some good ones, but I generally don't like them.

3535
02:46:07,280 --> 02:46:11,360
But they have some very good critiques of of liberalism

3536
02:46:11,360 --> 02:46:14,920
and of socialism that I think they get ignored way too much.

3537
02:46:15,160 --> 02:46:17,120
You know, people don't read Oakshot.

3538
02:46:17,120 --> 02:46:20,440
People don't read, you know, these conservative political theorists.

3539
02:46:21,120 --> 02:46:25,920
They just listen to like whatever Matt Gates is spouting or something, you know?

3540
02:46:26,120 --> 02:46:27,960
Yeah, exactly.

3541
02:46:28,640 --> 02:46:30,720
All righty. Well, I'm going to in stream here.

3542
02:46:30,960 --> 02:46:34,000
I'll talk to chat for like probably a minute or so.

3543
02:46:34,160 --> 02:46:37,000
But yeah, that was that was that was a lot of fun.

3544
02:46:37,000 --> 02:46:38,640
I think I was here for like an hour or two.

3545
02:46:38,640 --> 02:46:40,800
Yeah. Something about something along those lines.

3546
02:46:41,200 --> 02:46:43,360
Really fun conversation.

3547
02:46:43,360 --> 02:46:46,320
I I think we watched your video on fascism

3548
02:46:46,800 --> 02:46:49,280
on stream a couple of months ago when I was still on Twitch.

3549
02:46:49,280 --> 02:46:52,240
But I'm probably going to revisit that again,

3550
02:46:52,240 --> 02:46:55,440
because it's probably one of the better videos on fascism scene.

3551
02:46:55,440 --> 02:46:57,600
So I'm making a second one.

3552
02:46:57,840 --> 02:46:59,440
Oh, fucking beast.

3553
02:46:59,440 --> 02:47:03,560
I'm doing I'm currently working on another video and it's called

3554
02:47:04,640 --> 02:47:07,480
Is fascism actually capitalism in decay?

3555
02:47:07,960 --> 02:47:09,720
Oh, that's that's stupid.

3556
02:47:09,720 --> 02:47:12,280
Yeah, I can't wait for that one.

3557
02:47:12,280 --> 02:47:14,520
But the answer to that is like 90 percent.

3558
02:47:14,520 --> 02:47:16,680
No, it's not. Yeah, it is not.

3559
02:47:17,960 --> 02:47:19,560
Well, hey, man, it's been a fun conversation.

3560
02:47:19,560 --> 02:47:21,160
I'll catch you later, right?

3561
02:47:21,160 --> 02:47:22,960
Yep. I'll see you later. All right. Bye.
