WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.840
I have to run downstairs for just a second.

00:01.840 --> 00:02.800
Sure, okay, go ahead.

00:02.800 --> 00:04.600
If you want to respond to chat,

00:04.600 --> 00:05.440
you're more than welcome to,

00:05.440 --> 00:07.200
just don't say anything to us, all right?

00:07.200 --> 00:08.320
Sure, okay, sure.

00:09.280 --> 00:11.400
Well, the fact that Sanzil is 28 years old

00:11.400 --> 00:14.020
and supports a senile child sniffer, Joe Biden,

00:14.020 --> 00:17.520
who is obviously not any sort of strong young man

00:17.520 --> 00:19.140
to guide the country in a right direction

00:19.140 --> 00:20.600
is absolutely sad, pathetic,

00:20.600 --> 00:22.440
and borderline criminal on his end.

00:22.440 --> 00:23.920
Sanzil should be embarrassed.

00:23.920 --> 00:24.800
He should be,

00:25.800 --> 00:27.600
Biden doesn't want to do the right thing.

00:27.600 --> 00:28.760
Biden is just,

00:28.760 --> 00:30.480
doesn't care about the people of this country.

00:30.480 --> 00:32.540
He cares more about people from other places.

00:32.540 --> 00:33.640
That's very clear.

00:33.640 --> 00:37.120
He's allowing for many people all across this country

00:37.120 --> 00:40.480
to suffer in the broken systems and so forth.

00:40.480 --> 00:44.080
And he's allays policies, especially regarding the border,

00:44.080 --> 00:46.060
and he's trying to take people's guns,

00:46.060 --> 00:51.060
and he's trying to get you to take the very suspect vaccine,

00:51.280 --> 00:52.600
as well as many other things.

00:52.600 --> 00:57.160
And so, Joe Biden is not to be trusted in the slightest.

00:57.160 --> 00:58.640
He's just a criminal Democrat

00:59.480 --> 01:00.360
that doesn't give a fuck about the people

01:00.360 --> 01:03.400
and allows them to be fed slop for all time.

01:03.400 --> 01:04.840
He won from fraud.

01:04.840 --> 01:07.000
There's no way in hell he got 80 million votes.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.240
He has no rallies.

01:08.240 --> 01:10.880
He has nobody show up, nobody support him.

01:10.880 --> 01:12.600
And basically people just voted for him,

01:12.600 --> 01:14.280
not because they want what's right,

01:14.280 --> 01:16.260
not because they want an actual country,

01:16.260 --> 01:18.040
just because they want free stuff.

01:18.040 --> 01:20.240
So that's the situation in America today.

01:20.240 --> 01:22.560
It's, and Sanzil doesn't,

01:22.560 --> 01:25.120
Sanzil would rather support these criminals

01:25.120 --> 01:26.600
than actually do what's right

01:26.600 --> 01:29.320
and understand that this whole motherfucking system,

01:29.320 --> 01:31.840
this whole motherfucking country to some degree

01:31.840 --> 01:36.240
needs to be re-evaluated, re-looked at and so forth.

01:36.240 --> 01:39.000
Sanzil doesn't understand that we're just degrading

01:39.000 --> 01:40.260
as time goes by.

01:41.800 --> 01:43.320
Hello, sir, hi.

01:43.320 --> 01:44.320
Hi.

01:44.320 --> 01:45.920
So you sound like a lefty, dude.

01:47.080 --> 01:48.960
Maybe, I mean, I can tell you

01:48.960 --> 01:52.520
I'm just against the American government wholeheartedly.

01:52.520 --> 01:54.440
Yeah, you sound like a revolutionary socialist

01:55.320 --> 01:57.760
who, you know, wants to overthrow the government

01:57.760 --> 02:01.960
and did you a lot of social spending to-

02:01.960 --> 02:03.400
You happy with how America is today?

02:03.400 --> 02:04.760
Okay, I'm back.

02:04.760 --> 02:05.600
I'm not an American.

02:05.600 --> 02:06.600
I don't care how America is today.

02:06.600 --> 02:08.040
I don't give a fuck.

02:08.040 --> 02:12.480
Okay, well, where are you?

02:12.480 --> 02:14.280
I'm in Canada.

02:14.280 --> 02:16.960
Okay, well, that's the state

02:16.960 --> 02:18.960
maybe someone could argue even worse.

02:18.960 --> 02:20.880
What, do you work for the government or something?

02:20.880 --> 02:22.800
You and Sanzil, two best buddies,

02:22.800 --> 02:24.360
one works for the Canadian government,

02:25.240 --> 02:26.240
one works for the American government,

02:26.240 --> 02:27.680
both corrupt, both evil,

02:27.680 --> 02:29.520
both don't believe in the right thing.

02:29.520 --> 02:32.280
Does Sanzil work for the American government?

02:32.280 --> 02:34.840
In the loosest terms possible.

02:34.840 --> 02:36.440
I'm like in education.

02:36.440 --> 02:38.200
Sanzil looks connected to FBI agents.

02:38.200 --> 02:40.520
He's convinced that I'm a CIA agent, but-

02:40.520 --> 02:41.360
Oh, please.

02:41.360 --> 02:43.280
Okay, well, what do you actually do?

02:43.280 --> 02:44.200
I'm going to education.

02:44.200 --> 02:46.600
So right now I'm working like it's a substitute teacher

02:46.600 --> 02:48.800
and getting experience there.

02:48.800 --> 02:50.840
Oh, okay, fair enough.

02:50.840 --> 02:54.080
Didn't you get a degree for political science, bud?

02:54.760 --> 02:58.120
I'm in school for political science, yeah.

02:58.120 --> 02:59.560
Oh, okay, okay.

02:59.560 --> 03:01.200
You're best friends with Destiny,

03:01.200 --> 03:05.120
who's like a confirmed anti-extremist online federal agent

03:05.120 --> 03:06.240
or something like that, right?

03:06.240 --> 03:08.440
Well, I'm also anti-extremist, right?

03:08.440 --> 03:09.840
But I just like engaging with them

03:09.840 --> 03:11.440
because they're funny online.

03:11.440 --> 03:14.800
You don't think this justifies a little bit of a-

03:14.800 --> 03:17.120
I think that the only reason that these are extreme times

03:17.120 --> 03:19.480
are because people like you buy into literally

03:19.480 --> 03:22.720
every single fucking conspiracy that's ever been written

03:22.720 --> 03:25.760
on the face of the planet and you warp them all into one

03:25.760 --> 03:29.000
giant amalgamated fucking horrible conspiracy

03:29.000 --> 03:32.880
where somehow 9-11 is tied in with flat earth,

03:32.880 --> 03:35.000
is tied in with the JFK assassination,

03:35.000 --> 03:40.000
is tied in with fucking Wuhan fucking China lab leaks

03:40.720 --> 03:41.560
and shit.

03:41.560 --> 03:44.440
Yeah, I think it's your group

03:44.440 --> 03:46.440
that is making the world more extreme.

03:46.440 --> 03:51.440
And then we see extremism in the early 2000s

03:53.240 --> 03:55.040
after 9-11 from the right.

03:55.040 --> 03:57.680
And then there was a massive backlash from the left on that.

03:57.680 --> 03:59.560
It made a whole bunch of extremist lefties

03:59.560 --> 04:03.000
because you'd expect extremists on one side

04:03.000 --> 04:04.600
to breed extremists on the other side.

04:04.600 --> 04:05.720
And then, oh, okay, bye.

04:05.720 --> 04:06.560
Oh, okay, there you go.

04:06.560 --> 04:08.680
It's not, yeah, no, my mic had just an issue.

04:08.680 --> 04:10.040
It's not, no, it's not us.

04:10.040 --> 04:11.160
I disagree wholeheartedly.

04:11.160 --> 04:12.800
That's us making the extreme.

04:12.800 --> 04:15.440
The extremists are generated

04:15.440 --> 04:18.480
vis-a-vis failures of the American government.

04:18.480 --> 04:20.280
The extremists are produced by-

04:20.280 --> 04:22.400
But you always talk about the failures of the government,

04:22.920 --> 04:24.280
but you never tell me like specifics

04:24.280 --> 04:26.640
about what the government is failing us with.

04:26.640 --> 04:28.520
Well, we just laid it out, man.

04:28.520 --> 04:29.360
What about-

04:29.360 --> 04:30.200
Hold on, I just got here

04:30.200 --> 04:32.080
and I have a few questions for you.

04:32.080 --> 04:34.440
Yeah, I'll let you guys talk for a second.

04:34.440 --> 04:35.520
What do you want me to call you?

04:35.520 --> 04:37.000
Will you work for the Canadian government

04:37.000 --> 04:38.240
or what's the deal?

04:38.240 --> 04:39.840
He's a YouTuber, dog.

04:39.840 --> 04:41.520
I'm a YouTuber.

04:41.520 --> 04:43.080
I work for myself.

04:43.080 --> 04:44.080
That doesn't tell me anything.

04:44.080 --> 04:44.920
Yeah, okay.

04:44.920 --> 04:48.080
Okay, well, here, I'll tell you what.

04:48.080 --> 04:49.880
Give him a little bit of a,

04:49.880 --> 04:51.440
give him a little bit of a cut.

04:51.480 --> 04:53.400
I don't support Trudeau, no, no.

04:53.400 --> 04:56.160
I'm equal parts liberal and conservative.

04:56.160 --> 04:57.400
I've voted for the liberals before.

04:57.400 --> 04:58.480
I'm probably gonna vote conservative

04:58.480 --> 05:00.720
in the next Canadian election.

05:00.720 --> 05:03.400
I am definitely unaligned politically.

05:04.640 --> 05:06.160
Okay, sure.

05:06.160 --> 05:09.600
What do you think about Trudeau with his black face,

05:09.600 --> 05:10.440
with all of his various,

05:10.440 --> 05:11.840
have you seen all the costumes,

05:11.840 --> 05:14.080
outfits, these pictures of him in?

05:14.080 --> 05:16.080
Yeah, it's fucking hilarious.

05:16.080 --> 05:18.080
Oh yeah, the black face one's really funny.

05:18.080 --> 05:19.920
When he looks like Hitler in that other one,

05:19.920 --> 05:21.200
that one's hilarious too, man.

05:21.920 --> 05:22.760
That's a real joke.

05:22.760 --> 05:24.560
I think that, I think he was doing some,

05:24.560 --> 05:27.720
I think he was doing de Gaulle actually, but yeah.

05:27.720 --> 05:29.480
Yeah, Trudeau's a fucking joke.

05:29.480 --> 05:31.720
He's made Canada into a fucking joke.

05:31.720 --> 05:33.160
I'm not a fan of Trudeau.

05:33.160 --> 05:35.680
To be fair, I voted for him in 2015,

05:35.680 --> 05:38.520
but if you listen to Trudeau's speeches in like 2013,

05:38.520 --> 05:40.920
he was a significantly different person back then

05:40.920 --> 05:42.120
than he is now.

05:42.120 --> 05:43.320
I wouldn't vote for him again.

05:43.320 --> 05:45.600
Look at what the poor truckers in Canada.

05:45.600 --> 05:47.360
Imagine you're a trucker in Canada.

05:47.360 --> 05:49.280
That's gotta be the worst experience ever.

05:49.280 --> 05:50.720
Oh man, poor Canada truckers.

05:51.360 --> 05:52.960
I actually want to talk to you about that a bit, okay?

05:52.960 --> 05:56.320
So I don't want to put words in your mouth,

05:56.320 --> 05:59.160
but I kind of have a feeling of what your position is

05:59.160 --> 06:00.280
on this just by listening to you.

06:00.280 --> 06:02.640
So I want you to confirm this, all right?

06:02.640 --> 06:05.480
Were you one of the guys who, let's say a year ago,

06:05.480 --> 06:09.440
maybe two years ago, you were saying that

06:09.440 --> 06:12.080
the COVID lockdowns were going to be used by the government

06:12.080 --> 06:14.960
as a way to seize power and take away liberty

06:14.960 --> 06:16.680
from the people and that this was going to turn into

06:16.680 --> 06:19.360
some kind of everlasting situation?

06:20.320 --> 06:22.120
Well, it may not have turned,

06:22.120 --> 06:23.920
I agree that that still could happen.

06:25.120 --> 06:27.720
It's always possible that it could happen, yeah, but-

06:27.720 --> 06:29.640
Yeah, I agree with all that, yeah.

06:29.640 --> 06:30.600
Okay, yeah.

06:30.600 --> 06:33.120
So the thing is, is that you're correct

06:33.120 --> 06:35.760
in that there is a danger of that happening.

06:35.760 --> 06:39.840
And there were some, let's say pretty bad politicians

06:39.840 --> 06:40.920
who actually wanted to do that.

06:40.920 --> 06:42.640
Maybe not in the States, but in Canada

06:42.640 --> 06:44.640
and in the UK, definitely.

06:44.640 --> 06:46.040
There were some politicians who said,

06:46.040 --> 06:47.320
you know, this is the new normal.

06:47.360 --> 06:49.600
We're going to have lockdowns and masks forever.

06:49.600 --> 06:51.840
And you're going to have that VAX pass on your phone

06:51.840 --> 06:53.040
for the rest of time.

06:53.040 --> 06:55.280
And your liberties are gone and you're fucked

06:55.280 --> 06:57.880
because it's going to be all in the name of safety.

06:57.880 --> 07:00.240
And fair enough, there were some people out there

07:00.240 --> 07:03.080
who seemed pretty evil, who were pushing for that stuff.

07:03.080 --> 07:07.400
But here's the white pill, they all lost, all right?

07:07.400 --> 07:09.640
Because the VAX pass is gone in Canada.

07:09.640 --> 07:11.040
It's gone in the UK.

07:11.040 --> 07:12.800
I think it's gone in the States.

07:12.800 --> 07:15.400
None of these policies have actually come to fruition.

07:15.880 --> 07:17.800
It's not gone in the States.

07:17.800 --> 07:20.120
Really, so are you scanning a VAX pass

07:20.120 --> 07:21.600
every time you have to go into a restaurant

07:21.600 --> 07:22.760
like you did a few years ago?

07:22.760 --> 07:24.720
Not me, but not me personally.

07:24.720 --> 07:26.320
And I never, I got the VAX,

07:26.320 --> 07:28.480
so I never have scanned any pass ever.

07:28.480 --> 07:30.440
But not me personally, but I know people

07:30.440 --> 07:34.360
that still are having to present their VAX, yeah.

07:34.360 --> 07:36.200
100% that's still happening.

07:36.200 --> 07:37.640
Like password, whatever.

07:37.640 --> 07:40.760
In California that happens, I know for certain.

07:40.760 --> 07:43.760
But it probably happens in other places in America too, yeah.

07:44.760 --> 07:47.120
Now, to be fair, I don't know many Californians.

07:47.120 --> 07:50.000
I do know one who says that the VAX pass,

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
she told me the VAX pass is gone in California.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.680
So it's, well, it seems like

07:55.680 --> 07:58.160
that all of these measures were temporary.

07:58.160 --> 08:00.880
And though they could have been used to,

08:00.880 --> 08:03.600
let's say, expand a government tyranny,

08:03.600 --> 08:05.160
and there were some people who might have

08:05.160 --> 08:08.800
even wanted to do it, they lost, all right?

08:08.800 --> 08:11.420
And democracy actually won because those policies

08:11.420 --> 08:13.340
were so unpopular they vanished.

08:14.440 --> 08:18.760
Okay, but I agree that there's nothing really

08:18.760 --> 08:19.600
that they could do.

08:19.600 --> 08:21.560
I don't think it necessarily is about popularity

08:21.560 --> 08:24.400
or unpopularity or anything of that nature.

08:24.400 --> 08:25.240
I think-

08:25.240 --> 08:26.060
Why do you say that?

08:26.060 --> 08:28.640
I think to some degree, people just got tired of COVID

08:28.640 --> 08:31.440
and they got, they refused to be locked down anymore.

08:31.440 --> 08:34.240
Well, is that not popularity though?

08:34.240 --> 08:36.000
The policies of keeping people locked down

08:36.000 --> 08:38.840
became unpopular and so they vanished.

08:38.840 --> 08:40.820
That's how it would work in a democracy, you know?

08:40.820 --> 08:42.700
When the policies are popular, they happen.

08:42.700 --> 08:44.660
And when they're not popular, they stop.

08:46.340 --> 08:48.840
Yeah, but I don't, it's not about like,

08:49.740 --> 08:52.180
I don't think COVID happened because it was popular

08:52.180 --> 08:54.620
to shut everything down necessarily.

08:54.620 --> 08:56.140
And that's why, you're saying that's like

08:56.140 --> 08:59.860
kind of a warped view of like popular policy

08:59.860 --> 09:02.000
will always prevail or something of that nature.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.420
And that's just not the case.

09:03.420 --> 09:06.340
Well, not always, but it often prevails, yes.

09:07.340 --> 09:11.140
Okay, often is, I mean, it depends on the situation

09:11.140 --> 09:12.860
I'd say, but-

09:12.860 --> 09:16.060
Okay, so I don't know what your, hold on, hold on.

09:17.060 --> 09:18.380
I have to ask you a question here.

09:18.380 --> 09:20.180
It's gonna sound slightly insulting,

09:20.180 --> 09:21.460
but I'm not meaning to be insulting.

09:21.460 --> 09:23.580
I just wanna get to the heart of the matter, okay?

09:23.580 --> 09:25.020
What's your education level

09:25.020 --> 09:26.620
when it comes to this sort of thing?

09:28.100 --> 09:29.660
Education level?

09:29.660 --> 09:32.880
Yeah, how much do you know formally about politics?

09:33.900 --> 09:36.500
Canadian politics, I don't know too much about,

09:36.500 --> 09:38.300
but I can tell what they did with the trucker

09:38.300 --> 09:40.060
shutting everything down was not good.

09:40.100 --> 09:41.860
Like forcing them to get the vaccine

09:41.860 --> 09:44.580
when there's the massive protests.

09:44.580 --> 09:47.340
It's so, because they have to get the jab,

09:47.340 --> 09:48.660
they don't even trust the government.

09:48.660 --> 09:50.140
So why would the government,

09:50.140 --> 09:51.780
how can they ask them to get that?

09:51.780 --> 09:53.420
How can they require that?

09:53.420 --> 09:55.260
I don't necessarily disagree with you on that because-

09:55.260 --> 09:57.500
The threat of you can't feed your family.

09:57.500 --> 09:58.740
I don't necessarily disagree with you,

09:58.740 --> 10:01.220
but what I'm getting at though is,

10:01.220 --> 10:03.100
are you an elite theory guy?

10:03.100 --> 10:04.980
Is that like your framework that you're viewing

10:04.980 --> 10:07.900
all these government actions through is through elite theory?

10:07.900 --> 10:09.820
No, I don't, no, no, no, no.

10:10.420 --> 10:12.380
It's just obvious the whole system's corrupt, man.

10:12.380 --> 10:14.580
Biden's 400 years old sniffing kids.

10:14.580 --> 10:15.980
Is that a leader you should have?

10:15.980 --> 10:18.580
Is that what's right for the country?

10:18.580 --> 10:21.500
Like it's just obvious that everything's broken.

10:21.500 --> 10:23.900
Everybody's 400 pounds, yeah, through fraud, bud.

10:23.900 --> 10:26.820
Everything's broken, everybody's 400 pounds.

10:26.820 --> 10:28.520
The government's jack full of corrupt people

10:28.520 --> 10:30.300
that don't care about what's right.

10:30.300 --> 10:31.740
The systems are all broken.

10:31.740 --> 10:33.380
They're not producing good people.

10:33.380 --> 10:35.780
Their operation is horrible.

10:35.780 --> 10:36.820
They don't know what they're doing.

10:36.820 --> 10:38.180
They're not running correctly.

10:38.220 --> 10:40.260
They're not running well.

10:40.260 --> 10:42.460
I can't respond to everything, but-

10:42.460 --> 10:44.380
Yeah, let him talk a little bit, all right?

10:44.380 --> 10:45.500
I can't respond to all those points,

10:45.500 --> 10:46.820
but there is one that I want to talk about

10:46.820 --> 10:48.220
because you've mentioned a lot

10:48.220 --> 10:51.140
about how you don't believe democracy is working, right?

10:52.140 --> 10:54.680
100%, yes, absolutely.

10:54.680 --> 10:56.140
So is this a case-

10:56.140 --> 10:57.740
Look at where we are in America today

10:57.740 --> 10:59.140
with so-called democracy.

10:59.140 --> 11:00.820
Yeah, it's real beauty.

11:00.820 --> 11:04.500
So is this a case of you think democracy itself,

11:04.500 --> 11:07.000
like the practice of voting is just a bad practice,

11:07.000 --> 11:09.800
or do you think that democracy could work,

11:09.800 --> 11:11.920
but it's not working and it's been corrupted?

11:11.920 --> 11:15.360
Well, you've got to do it correctly, I believe,

11:15.360 --> 11:16.400
if you're going to do it,

11:16.400 --> 11:18.960
but you have to have laws that make sense

11:18.960 --> 11:21.640
and so forth in that regard.

11:21.640 --> 11:25.480
Right, so you're not anti-democracy.

11:25.480 --> 11:26.640
It's just that you think that democracy

11:26.640 --> 11:28.600
right now isn't working.

11:28.600 --> 11:31.300
Well, I'm not anti-democracy, not necessarily, no,

11:31.300 --> 11:35.320
but whatever the best political structure

11:35.360 --> 11:39.000
for any given country is, is whatever it is, I'd say.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
So, certainly I don't believe

11:41.000 --> 11:43.380
that every nation should ascribe to democracy,

11:45.800 --> 11:46.840
but I think-

11:46.840 --> 11:48.520
But America should?

11:48.520 --> 11:50.860
Well, I think maybe there can be some regards

11:50.860 --> 11:52.340
where it works, I guess,

11:52.340 --> 11:56.680
but ultimately, by and large, I'd say I'm against it

11:56.680 --> 12:00.600
because I think that you can produce

12:00.600 --> 12:02.880
a better world without it.

12:03.760 --> 12:05.840
It doesn't even make sense necessarily to me

12:05.840 --> 12:07.960
that everybody gets a vote,

12:07.960 --> 12:09.760
everybody gets treated as they're equal.

12:09.760 --> 12:13.600
The government asks everybody's opinion on these matters.

12:13.600 --> 12:16.480
I don't think that that even makes sense necessarily, so.

12:16.480 --> 12:17.320
Go ahead.

12:17.320 --> 12:19.000
So, wait, I just want to make this clear.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.940
So, that sounds like that even if democracy

12:21.940 --> 12:23.360
was perfectly functioning,

12:23.360 --> 12:25.440
you still wouldn't want democracy

12:25.440 --> 12:27.600
because you don't think democracy itself is good.

12:27.600 --> 12:29.720
So, it's not that democracy is currently broken,

12:29.720 --> 12:32.520
it's that democracy isn't good, even when it's working.

12:33.400 --> 12:34.880
Is that what you think?

12:34.880 --> 12:37.420
Like I said, I think maybe it can work in some regards,

12:37.420 --> 12:40.080
but yeah, I'm generally by and large against it.

12:40.080 --> 12:41.860
Yeah, especially in the U.S. more so,

12:41.860 --> 12:44.560
but I can't really speak to other places that well.

12:44.560 --> 12:45.400
Oh, that's fine.

12:45.400 --> 12:46.900
We can talk about America, that's fine.

12:46.900 --> 12:49.320
Why are you against democracy in the U.S.?

12:49.320 --> 12:51.200
Well, because look at the situation, man.

12:51.200 --> 12:52.680
Look at what it's been able to produce.

12:52.680 --> 12:54.320
Look at what we're dealing with today.

12:54.320 --> 12:55.800
It's produced-

12:55.800 --> 12:57.200
What if it actually worked?

12:57.200 --> 12:59.120
It wasn't rigged as you think.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.600
Assume for a minute that the elections

13:01.600 --> 13:05.760
were all actually not fraudulent, all right?

13:05.760 --> 13:06.860
Even in that situation,

13:06.860 --> 13:09.120
would you say that not democracy is not good?

13:10.800 --> 13:12.800
Well, even, yeah, yeah, yes.

13:12.800 --> 13:14.120
As for America, yeah.

13:14.120 --> 13:16.300
Because look at what it's produced societally.

13:16.300 --> 13:19.520
Look at what the point, look at what it's led us to, man.

13:19.520 --> 13:21.320
The people in America are dying all over.

13:21.320 --> 13:22.480
They're killing each other.

13:22.480 --> 13:23.400
Nobody has anything.

13:23.400 --> 13:25.040
Everybody's 400 pounds.

13:25.040 --> 13:26.660
The government is shutting everything down.

13:26.660 --> 13:28.400
The mad scientists have taken over.

13:28.400 --> 13:30.800
Biden's 800 years old with a voice changer.

13:30.840 --> 13:32.800
He's got an application for the illegal aliens

13:32.800 --> 13:34.040
and he's sniffing the youth, man.

13:34.040 --> 13:35.880
Okay, don't go on a whole monologue

13:35.880 --> 13:37.640
because I don't know how much time he has, all right?

13:37.640 --> 13:38.480
I don't want to-

13:38.480 --> 13:40.200
To be fair, I kind of enjoy some of these.

13:40.200 --> 13:42.320
Yeah, I don't want to make you feel like

13:42.320 --> 13:44.240
you're wasting your time here.

13:44.240 --> 13:45.200
There's no justice.

13:45.200 --> 13:46.920
Nobody believes in what's right.

13:46.920 --> 13:49.720
There's no, you have tremendous problems in all of this.

13:49.720 --> 13:50.560
I know what you mean.

13:50.560 --> 13:51.400
I know what you mean.

13:51.400 --> 13:55.960
It's just that, so like, did you vote Trump in 2016?

13:55.960 --> 13:58.300
Yeah, I voted for Trump twice, yeah.

13:58.300 --> 13:59.320
Right, right, yeah.

13:59.320 --> 14:02.640
And do you think that democracy worked in 2016 then?

14:06.520 --> 14:11.280
Worked, I don't, to some degree, I guess, sure.

14:11.280 --> 14:12.840
It's always working to some degree.

14:12.840 --> 14:14.920
I don't know, that's kind of a weird question, worked.

14:14.920 --> 14:17.040
Well, because it sounds like your problem

14:17.040 --> 14:19.080
is not necessarily with democracy.

14:19.080 --> 14:21.120
It's just with the outcome, right?

14:21.120 --> 14:23.480
So if Trump actually won 2020,

14:23.480 --> 14:25.120
you'd be a lot more cool with it.

14:27.200 --> 14:28.680
I mean, it would be better,

14:28.880 --> 14:31.120
but I don't know necessarily if I'd be cool with it.

14:31.120 --> 14:34.920
I think there are problems that need, that are,

14:34.920 --> 14:36.940
do you agree, do you think that democracy

14:36.940 --> 14:40.000
always produces the best results for any given society?

14:40.000 --> 14:40.880
No.

14:40.880 --> 14:41.720
Okay, okay.

14:41.720 --> 14:44.600
So you're not even for democracy necessarily.

14:44.600 --> 14:45.520
I am in America.

14:45.520 --> 14:46.400
I am in the West.

14:46.400 --> 14:49.920
Oh, okay, so you, so do you, hold on, sir, sir, sir.

14:49.920 --> 14:51.080
Has democracy produced,

14:51.080 --> 14:53.360
has democracy in America produced better results

14:53.360 --> 14:54.820
than a fascist state?

14:55.720 --> 14:56.560
Yes.

14:56.560 --> 14:58.560
How do you know that, you fucking idiot?

14:59.920 --> 15:01.460
Tell me how, tell me, hey, stupid fuck.

15:01.460 --> 15:02.760
Tell me how you know that.

15:02.760 --> 15:04.360
You can't open your eyes all the way, tell me.

15:04.360 --> 15:06.280
How do you know that, bud?

15:06.280 --> 15:08.560
That democracy's produced better results

15:08.560 --> 15:09.520
than a fascist state?

15:09.520 --> 15:10.960
Yeah, yeah, tell me how you know that.

15:10.960 --> 15:12.600
Or a fascist dictator would.

15:12.600 --> 15:13.440
Tell me how you know that.

15:13.440 --> 15:14.260
Tell me how you know that.

15:14.260 --> 15:16.180
We'll look at, okay, I can tell you.

15:16.180 --> 15:18.700
Look at the results of all the various fascist states

15:18.700 --> 15:20.280
that we've seen in history.

15:20.280 --> 15:21.860
That does, that says nothing to me.

15:21.860 --> 15:23.280
That's absolutely retarded

15:23.280 --> 15:25.560
and it's an unbelievably stupid take.

15:25.600 --> 15:27.180
So I disagree totally.

15:27.180 --> 15:28.840
So are you saying, hold on, hold on.

15:28.840 --> 15:30.960
That as those, those would not necessarily

15:30.960 --> 15:32.180
play out in America at all.

15:32.180 --> 15:34.880
That would not be what happens 100%.

15:34.880 --> 15:35.720
Just to be clear,

15:35.720 --> 15:39.080
are you doing the real fascism has never been tried thing?

15:40.140 --> 15:42.720
No, I'm saying that you are stupid, man.

15:42.720 --> 15:45.280
If you don't believe that there are better systems

15:45.280 --> 15:48.840
that could produce results superior than democracy.

15:48.840 --> 15:49.680
Here's what I'll say.

15:49.680 --> 15:50.760
Dude, that's just stupid.

15:50.760 --> 15:52.880
I think that like, nobody's gonna ever say

15:52.880 --> 15:55.720
that like we have like the perfect best system

15:55.720 --> 15:57.880
like right now and nothing could ever be improved upon.

15:57.880 --> 16:01.360
No, no person with like a half a fucking brain cell

16:01.360 --> 16:02.280
would say that.

16:02.280 --> 16:04.480
But what we're saying, I think this is what,

16:06.560 --> 16:08.080
there's a lot of syllables.

16:08.080 --> 16:10.200
Can I call you anything but.

16:10.200 --> 16:11.040
I think you're my name.

16:11.040 --> 16:11.860
My name's Dev.

16:11.860 --> 16:12.700
Dev, okay.

16:12.700 --> 16:13.540
My real name.

16:13.540 --> 16:15.400
Two government agents, two government agents here.

16:15.400 --> 16:16.400
I don't think that anybody.

16:16.400 --> 16:17.720
I work for YouTube, baby.

16:17.720 --> 16:19.640
I don't work for the government.

16:19.640 --> 16:22.440
But I don't think that either of us are saying

16:23.020 --> 16:24.480
that like this is a perfect system

16:24.480 --> 16:26.480
and I've never fucking said that.

16:26.480 --> 16:29.480
But like you can always like obviously improve

16:29.480 --> 16:33.800
on the system, but you have to like improve on the system

16:33.800 --> 16:35.140
and like fix the things that are broken.

16:35.140 --> 16:38.600
But like why fix what's not broken, right?

16:39.600 --> 16:42.200
I guess my question is more that

16:42.200 --> 16:44.760
why do you think an American fascist state

16:44.760 --> 16:46.560
would be better than what you have now?

16:46.560 --> 16:47.800
Why fix what's broken?

16:47.800 --> 16:51.040
It's all, cause it's all broken to answer both of you guys.

16:51.040 --> 16:52.000
Yeah, fix what's not.

16:52.560 --> 16:53.400
It's all broken.

16:53.400 --> 16:55.640
To answer both of you guys at once, it's all broken.

16:55.640 --> 16:58.660
It's all not working how it should.

16:58.660 --> 17:02.280
It's all, the corporations rule the country, man.

17:02.280 --> 17:03.920
Nobody believes in what's right.

17:03.920 --> 17:06.500
The people are like being turned into robots.

17:06.500 --> 17:07.560
The people are being like.

17:07.560 --> 17:09.400
Why would a fascist state fix that?

17:10.960 --> 17:13.320
A fascist state could actually maybe, I believe,

17:13.320 --> 17:16.960
produce better results than a democracy has produced.

17:16.960 --> 17:17.780
But why?

17:18.880 --> 17:20.720
Because I think it could be managed better.

17:20.800 --> 17:22.440
I think that it could be altered.

17:22.440 --> 17:24.000
It could be controlled better.

17:24.000 --> 17:26.040
I think that you have problems that are,

17:26.040 --> 17:28.840
people are, criminals are voting for.

17:28.840 --> 17:31.720
Like our legal, our political system isn't about

17:31.720 --> 17:34.240
necessarily the best and brightest rising to the top.

17:34.240 --> 17:36.740
Most of these politicians are just front people

17:36.740 --> 17:40.160
for their constituents or their financiers

17:40.160 --> 17:42.480
or their backers and the likes.

17:42.480 --> 17:46.680
So like they vote in ways that aren't,

17:46.680 --> 17:49.880
like that they know are not necessarily the best.

17:50.680 --> 17:52.760
Democrats vote illegal people in so they can get them

17:52.760 --> 17:55.000
to vote for their party someday, potentially.

17:57.720 --> 17:59.040
Okay, I understand the criticism.

17:59.040 --> 18:00.880
And there's actually some decent criticism in there.

18:00.880 --> 18:03.320
It's just, why do you think a fascist state

18:03.320 --> 18:05.320
would manage that situation better?

18:05.320 --> 18:08.120
Because I think it could be, you could easily control.

18:08.120 --> 18:11.200
I think, oh man, because when you have that,

18:11.200 --> 18:14.960
you have like a realm of possibility that's different

18:14.960 --> 18:18.760
than there are gridlocked bureaucracy now.

18:18.760 --> 18:23.760
Our gridlock bureaucracy that can't change anything

18:23.920 --> 18:25.640
or takes forever to change it.

18:27.200 --> 18:29.560
We live in the world of problems, man.

18:29.560 --> 18:31.480
And it's like a fascist leader could come

18:31.480 --> 18:34.880
and clean that up in, in my opinion, rather quickly

18:34.880 --> 18:37.200
versus what we have now.

18:37.200 --> 18:38.760
Like, you don't think so?

18:38.760 --> 18:40.720
You don't think a fascist leader who believed

18:40.720 --> 18:42.680
in the right thing, who wanted to do what's right,

18:42.680 --> 18:45.120
could just come in and produce results like crazy?

18:45.120 --> 18:46.440
You're skeptical of that?

18:47.400 --> 18:49.680
You think democracy is producing better results

18:49.680 --> 18:51.280
than a fascist leader could?

18:51.280 --> 18:53.120
A fascist leader could give you a real cut?

18:53.120 --> 18:53.960
I understand the point of view.

18:53.960 --> 18:56.120
I understand the point of view because for example,

18:56.120 --> 18:57.760
you know what NIMBYism is, right?

18:59.000 --> 19:01.240
Oh no, NIMBYism?

19:01.240 --> 19:05.080
N-I-M-B-Y, NIMBY means not in my backyard, all right?

19:05.080 --> 19:08.040
NIMBYism is a problem unique to democracy.

19:08.040 --> 19:10.000
So what the idea is, is, you know,

19:10.000 --> 19:12.920
let's say that your country needs a nuclear power plant

19:12.920 --> 19:14.880
or it needs a prison or it needs something

19:14.880 --> 19:17.360
that is necessary, but it's unpopular

19:17.360 --> 19:20.760
for the neighborhood that it's built in, right?

19:20.760 --> 19:22.240
And so what you have is you have people

19:22.240 --> 19:25.320
who are democratic voters, they turn around

19:25.320 --> 19:27.120
and they say, well, you know what?

19:27.120 --> 19:28.600
I know we need the nuclear power plant,

19:28.600 --> 19:30.400
we need the prison, but I don't want it in my neighborhood

19:30.400 --> 19:32.360
because I don't feel comfortable with that.

19:32.360 --> 19:35.200
And so everyone votes to not have the necessary

19:35.200 --> 19:37.200
infrastructure in their neighborhood,

19:37.200 --> 19:38.680
so not in my backyard.

19:38.680 --> 19:40.840
And so it gets built nowhere.

19:40.840 --> 19:43.560
And that's a problem unique to democracy is that

19:43.600 --> 19:46.560
people tend to vote in their own interests.

19:46.560 --> 19:48.080
And when that interest doesn't line up

19:48.080 --> 19:51.440
with the wider society, society tends to suffer.

19:51.440 --> 19:52.280
So-

19:53.920 --> 19:57.200
Yeah, when that interest doesn't do what's right

19:57.200 --> 19:59.240
for the country, it doesn't produce the right result,

19:59.240 --> 20:01.800
then yeah, there's a problem there, obviously.

20:01.800 --> 20:05.440
You know, people are voting Democrats for free stuff

20:05.440 --> 20:07.920
and illegal aliens are just pouring in our country

20:07.920 --> 20:09.840
at this point in time.

20:09.840 --> 20:12.360
So here's the thing, so you could have, for example,

20:12.360 --> 20:15.600
a benevolent dictator who says, you know what?

20:15.600 --> 20:17.880
We need the nuclear power plant and we need the prison.

20:17.880 --> 20:19.000
It doesn't matter if it's unpopular.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.120
I'm going to do what's necessary

20:20.120 --> 20:21.440
and I'm going to build the infrastructure.

20:21.440 --> 20:23.680
And if individual people don't like it,

20:23.680 --> 20:25.440
well, they can suffer because fuck you,

20:25.440 --> 20:27.600
we have to get what we have to get.

20:27.600 --> 20:30.720
And that's a pretty reasonable critique,

20:30.720 --> 20:33.800
a pretty reasonable authoritarian critique of democracy.

20:34.840 --> 20:37.040
So I understand your point of view.

20:37.040 --> 20:40.000
I've done a lot of reading of fascists recently

20:40.000 --> 20:41.620
for some projects that I've have going on.

20:41.900 --> 20:43.060
I know what's going on.

20:44.180 --> 20:46.700
The reason that I brought up elite theory

20:46.700 --> 20:48.420
is elite theory is basically,

20:48.420 --> 20:52.180
it's a description of how governments operate.

20:52.180 --> 20:54.500
It's a theory of how governments operate, right?

20:54.500 --> 20:58.580
And the idea is that a small minority of people

20:59.480 --> 21:02.280
and they consist of members of the economic elite

21:02.280 --> 21:05.220
and people who make policy in government,

21:05.220 --> 21:07.420
they hold the most power in society

21:07.420 --> 21:10.700
and that that power operates independently

21:10.700 --> 21:12.580
of democratic elections, all right?

21:12.580 --> 21:13.740
So oftentimes-

21:13.740 --> 21:15.380
I probably agree with that to some degree.

21:15.380 --> 21:17.500
I mean, independently to some degree.

21:17.500 --> 21:19.380
I mean, go ahead.

21:19.380 --> 21:22.860
Right, so you've been talking about

21:22.860 --> 21:24.500
an American fascist state

21:24.500 --> 21:27.060
where a dictator could come in and clean everything up.

21:27.060 --> 21:29.520
But at the same time, you've also been decrying

21:29.520 --> 21:31.660
the very same use of that power

21:31.660 --> 21:34.660
that you want to seize by other people.

21:34.660 --> 21:36.180
It's a cabal of people

21:36.180 --> 21:38.240
that don't necessarily have government control.

21:38.240 --> 21:40.340
You're talking about elites in all different regards

21:40.860 --> 21:42.100
that don't necessarily have anything to do

21:42.100 --> 21:43.140
with the government, right?

21:43.140 --> 21:43.960
I mean-

21:43.960 --> 21:44.800
But here's the thing.

21:44.800 --> 21:47.780
You would make the exact same elite structure.

21:47.780 --> 21:49.440
That's what a fascist state is.

21:51.140 --> 21:53.100
It's not some libertarian decentralized paradise.

21:53.100 --> 21:54.740
It would be different elites.

21:54.740 --> 21:56.860
It would be different elites.

21:56.860 --> 21:59.460
The elites that you agree with is what he's saying.

21:59.460 --> 22:02.240
Yes, so your problem isn't with the nature of power

22:02.240 --> 22:03.700
as it currently exists.

22:03.700 --> 22:06.220
Your problem is with who is currently wielding it.

22:06.220 --> 22:08.340
You want the actual structure to be the same.

22:08.340 --> 22:10.540
You just want somebody else in charge of it.

22:10.540 --> 22:13.140
Well, those people don't have any power

22:13.140 --> 22:14.860
akin to a fascist leader now.

22:14.860 --> 22:17.980
So in that regard, you're comparing elitism

22:17.980 --> 22:20.300
in two different guards that are not comparable,

22:20.300 --> 22:21.140
in my opinion.

22:21.140 --> 22:23.700
Oh, sure, you want more elitism, right?

22:23.700 --> 22:25.340
Okay, here.

22:25.340 --> 22:27.780
I'm gonna grab something real quick.

22:27.780 --> 22:29.020
Okay, sure.

22:29.020 --> 22:31.160
When it comes to elite theory, I'm gonna post this.

22:31.160 --> 22:34.540
If you wanna bring it up on screen so and so, you can.

22:34.540 --> 22:35.860
You agree that there are elites

22:35.860 --> 22:37.560
that are controlling things, right?

22:37.640 --> 22:39.240
Of course there are, of course there are, yes.

22:39.240 --> 22:41.880
I don't think anyone can disagree with that.

22:41.880 --> 22:44.580
Okay, and then these elites have more influence on,

22:44.580 --> 22:46.440
they have a tremendous influence on society

22:46.440 --> 22:48.340
compared to your average person, right?

22:49.200 --> 22:50.360
Of course, yes, absolutely.

22:50.360 --> 22:51.700
Okay, okay.

22:51.700 --> 22:53.460
So this is a study.

22:53.460 --> 22:55.480
This is what most people who believe

22:55.480 --> 22:57.560
in this form of government lean on.

22:57.560 --> 22:58.800
They lean on this study here.

22:58.800 --> 23:00.400
It's from Cambridge University,

23:01.640 --> 23:03.560
Testing Theories of American Politics,

23:03.560 --> 23:05.920
Elites, Interest Groups, and Average Citizens.

23:06.240 --> 23:07.560
Let me just tell you what this says, okay?

23:07.560 --> 23:08.840
Real quick, real quick, okay?

23:08.840 --> 23:11.520
So the data in the study is basically that

23:12.480 --> 23:15.800
if you take, if you divide people by income,

23:15.800 --> 23:17.560
income brackets, right?

23:17.560 --> 23:20.980
And then you discover who they vote for

23:20.980 --> 23:23.240
and why they vote for them.

23:23.240 --> 23:26.260
If the person that they voted for wins,

23:26.260 --> 23:28.600
the reason that they voted for them

23:28.600 --> 23:33.600
is less likely to become policy the poorer that you are,

23:33.780 --> 23:34.720
if that makes sense.

23:34.720 --> 23:39.120
So basically, let's say poor people voted for Trump

23:39.120 --> 23:42.880
in 2016 for policy A and rich people voted for Trump

23:42.880 --> 23:45.760
in 2016 for policy B, all right?

23:45.760 --> 23:47.660
Once Trump got into office,

23:47.660 --> 23:50.000
the chance that he would implement policy A

23:50.000 --> 23:52.640
for the poor people is around 0%.

23:52.640 --> 23:55.840
Meanwhile, the chance that he would implement policy B

23:55.840 --> 23:59.040
for the rich people is around 60%.

23:59.040 --> 24:00.360
So, oh, he just took off.

24:00.360 --> 24:01.200
Oh no, he's back.

24:01.200 --> 24:03.400
Okay, well, I'd have to look at this.

24:04.360 --> 24:05.680
That doesn't sound right to me

24:05.680 --> 24:08.880
that just because of your financial situation,

24:08.880 --> 24:11.560
you're more likely or unlikely to have a politician

24:11.560 --> 24:13.920
do any given thing for you is,

24:13.920 --> 24:16.280
I mean, I probably to some degree that's true,

24:16.280 --> 24:18.000
but I don't think the way you're framing it

24:18.000 --> 24:20.440
is very dishonest, I feel, but okay.

24:20.440 --> 24:21.360
How do you mean?

24:21.360 --> 24:22.200
I mean, it's-

24:22.200 --> 24:25.580
Well, because it's the idea that like,

24:25.580 --> 24:27.560
if you had large numbers of poor people

24:27.560 --> 24:32.000
pushing for something like versus like rich people,

24:32.000 --> 24:34.040
like I just don't, the way you said there

24:34.040 --> 24:35.280
in regard to the poor people,

24:35.280 --> 24:36.900
like it's just Trump's doesn't do anything

24:36.900 --> 24:37.740
for the poor people,

24:37.740 --> 24:38.920
it only does things for the rich people.

24:38.920 --> 24:41.880
That's like laughably retarded, so.

24:41.880 --> 24:42.720
Well, yeah, but I mean,

24:42.720 --> 24:44.340
if we're talking about a cabal of people

24:44.340 --> 24:47.320
who run the government, this is exactly how it would be.

24:47.320 --> 24:50.200
It's not a cabal of people who run the government though,

24:50.200 --> 24:52.160
the elites, like.

24:52.160 --> 24:53.000
No.

24:53.000 --> 24:55.080
Do you think elitism and fascism are the same thing?

24:55.080 --> 24:59.900
Really quick, I'm gonna help you explain your point, okay?

24:59.900 --> 25:01.980
So like, I think the way that he would describe things

25:02.800 --> 25:03.640
is that the elites aren't necessarily

25:03.640 --> 25:05.820
like in control of government directly.

25:05.820 --> 25:08.460
They're also like pushing culture in such a way

25:08.460 --> 25:13.460
as to like make people more subservient

25:13.740 --> 25:15.060
or to make people, you know,

25:15.060 --> 25:16.580
like he keeps on bringing the fact

25:16.580 --> 25:19.780
that people are like fatter now than they used to be.

25:19.780 --> 25:22.020
So like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

25:22.020 --> 25:25.100
So you're going more down like a James Burnham

25:25.100 --> 25:27.720
managerial revolution route, right?

25:28.820 --> 25:30.460
No, sir, I believe in what's right

25:30.460 --> 25:32.500
and I believe in fixing America, man.

25:32.500 --> 25:35.100
I believe in stopping terrorism,

25:35.100 --> 25:37.460
stopping doing what's right.

25:37.460 --> 25:39.180
Yeah, that's what I want to happen, yeah.

25:39.180 --> 25:42.340
I think a fascist leader could speed rocket that.

25:42.340 --> 25:45.340
Right, so what I mean to say is James Burnham,

25:45.340 --> 25:46.940
he theorized this idea.

25:46.940 --> 25:51.940
And the idea was basically that Marx's analysis of classes,

25:51.940 --> 25:53.660
the bourgeoisie and the proletariat

25:53.660 --> 25:58.660
had been completely rendered useless by the post-war era.

26:01.020 --> 26:05.940
And so he theorized of, he called it the managerial class.

26:05.940 --> 26:08.520
And I think people like Moldbug came along later

26:08.520 --> 26:11.060
and they talk about the cathedral in the same way, right?

26:11.060 --> 26:12.380
But the idea of the managerial class,

26:12.380 --> 26:15.060
the managerial class is a class of people

26:15.060 --> 26:19.260
who they defy Marxist expectations because they own nothing.

26:19.260 --> 26:20.780
They own no property,

26:20.780 --> 26:23.720
but they control massive amounts of wealth and property

26:23.720 --> 26:25.240
because they're managers, they're not owners,

26:25.240 --> 26:26.080
they're managers.

26:26.080 --> 26:29.380
So they have control without ownership.

26:29.380 --> 26:33.300
And generally right-leaning people view the government

26:33.300 --> 26:36.940
and view elites as being members of this managerial class

26:36.940 --> 26:38.780
who don't actually own all that much,

26:38.780 --> 26:41.180
but they wield tremendous amounts of power.

26:43.500 --> 26:44.340
Is that?

26:44.340 --> 26:45.180
Oh, he left again.

26:45.180 --> 26:47.820
What you said was just like weird and confusing.

26:47.820 --> 26:49.740
So what?

26:49.740 --> 26:52.940
Managerial class, what's your point?

26:52.940 --> 26:55.820
Well, does that sound like how you're viewing this?

26:55.820 --> 26:57.460
Joe Biden isn't like super rich,

26:57.460 --> 26:59.620
but he still wields all of this power, right?

26:59.620 --> 27:00.880
And that's what the elites are.

27:00.880 --> 27:03.060
They're not like the hyper wealthy.

27:03.060 --> 27:04.580
They're just the-

27:04.580 --> 27:05.900
I agree that you can have elites

27:05.900 --> 27:08.940
in probably a lot of different regards, sure.

27:08.940 --> 27:11.060
We were in terms of government and wealth.

27:11.060 --> 27:13.740
And I mean, there's not many things beside that.

27:13.740 --> 27:14.620
I mean, I guess that's it.

27:14.620 --> 27:16.940
I mean, but yeah, you can have elites that have,

27:16.940 --> 27:18.620
you know, financial backings.

27:18.620 --> 27:21.180
And what are you talking about with the managerial class?

27:21.180 --> 27:22.260
What was the point of saying that?

27:22.260 --> 27:24.020
Like, I just don't understand.

27:24.020 --> 27:27.820
So every time we've gone down a few rabbit holes now

27:27.820 --> 27:28.660
in this conversation.

27:28.660 --> 27:32.260
And it seems like every single time that we discuss this,

27:32.260 --> 27:35.100
you don't actually want to change much about the way

27:35.100 --> 27:37.020
that society is structured.

27:37.020 --> 27:39.960
You just want to be, you want your guy to have the power.

27:39.960 --> 27:41.140
That's it.

27:41.140 --> 27:44.380
You know, cause like everything that you said.

27:44.380 --> 27:46.380
It's not about, it's not about, it's not, sir.

27:46.380 --> 27:48.380
It's not about my guy having the power.

27:48.380 --> 27:51.160
It's about what's right and what's saying

27:51.160 --> 27:53.140
and what's rational prevailing.

27:53.260 --> 27:57.860
But you think that your people are the ones

27:57.860 --> 28:01.020
that would be able to like do what is good.

28:01.020 --> 28:01.860
Yeah, I do.

28:03.060 --> 28:04.100
Leftists think that too.

28:04.100 --> 28:05.420
Yeah, exactly.

28:05.420 --> 28:08.020
Other people think that that's what's going on

28:08.020 --> 28:09.420
with their side as well.

28:09.420 --> 28:11.340
Like when I was a, when I was a socialist,

28:11.340 --> 28:15.180
I tried so hard to find ways to like, you know,

28:15.180 --> 28:17.980
like pretzel myself into a position that like,

28:17.980 --> 28:20.900
or into like figuring out how like Joseph Stalin

28:20.900 --> 28:23.740
wasn't like nearly as bad as he was, right?

28:23.740 --> 28:26.020
But like, then I realized that that was fucking retarded

28:26.020 --> 28:28.500
as fuck because he was a really bad dude.

28:28.500 --> 28:29.580
I don't think he's so bad.

28:29.580 --> 28:30.420
No.

28:30.420 --> 28:31.980
I think he was a real bad,

28:31.980 --> 28:33.980
he's a bad hombre in my opinion, but.

28:34.980 --> 28:38.220
You hear guys like Vash and you listen to this guy talk

28:38.220 --> 28:40.140
and he talks for like 15 minutes.

28:40.140 --> 28:42.780
And what he's actually saying is good things are good

28:42.780 --> 28:43.860
and bad things are bad.

28:43.860 --> 28:45.900
And it's like, well, it doesn't tell you anything.

28:45.900 --> 28:47.500
You know what I mean?

28:47.500 --> 28:50.540
So you keep saying, I want to do what's right.

28:51.020 --> 28:52.060
Well, what is what's right?

28:52.060 --> 28:53.020
What is the good?

28:53.020 --> 28:55.620
Like, what are you appealing to here beyond,

28:55.620 --> 28:58.300
it just seems like you're just appealing to power.

28:58.300 --> 29:01.060
Yeah, well, what's right is obviously not this, sir.

29:01.060 --> 29:02.020
That's what it's to say.

29:02.020 --> 29:05.820
I mean, you, you know, you say that it sounds complicated

29:05.820 --> 29:08.700
to say what's right is right and what's bad is bad.

29:08.700 --> 29:10.900
But I think that like, if people actually,

29:10.900 --> 29:12.580
the thing is people don't know what's right

29:12.580 --> 29:14.260
and what's wrong anymore in our society.

29:14.260 --> 29:17.060
So they go, so that's how we have the society we do today.

29:17.060 --> 29:18.260
People don't, quite frankly,

29:18.260 --> 29:20.020
people don't care what's right anymore.

29:20.340 --> 29:21.780
How did people know in the past what was right

29:21.780 --> 29:23.460
and what was wrong?

29:23.460 --> 29:24.620
I don't think that they,

29:24.620 --> 29:27.420
I think maybe they had a different, I don't know.

29:27.420 --> 29:29.140
Did they know in the past for certain?

29:29.140 --> 29:30.420
I don't know if I think that they knew

29:30.420 --> 29:31.580
in the past for certain.

29:32.820 --> 29:36.860
But I think that it's obvious that things aren't right now

29:36.860 --> 29:40.260
and you can't tell that democracy's not,

29:40.260 --> 29:42.380
okay, but you think that it's going to be fixed

29:42.380 --> 29:43.220
through democracy.

29:43.220 --> 29:45.580
You think that what the best ideas are going to prevail.

29:45.580 --> 29:47.500
Why haven't they prevailed already?

29:47.500 --> 29:49.580
Why hasn't democracy led to a better results

29:50.060 --> 29:50.900
than we have now?

29:50.900 --> 29:52.500
Why is, because like-

29:52.500 --> 29:53.900
I can answer that.

29:53.900 --> 29:56.580
I don't think democracy is the problem, all right?

29:56.580 --> 30:00.180
I think the reason that democracy is failing,

30:00.180 --> 30:01.820
and I don't even think it's really failing that much,

30:01.820 --> 30:03.380
but there are some problems with it, obviously.

30:03.380 --> 30:05.060
The problem is the US government, sir.

30:05.060 --> 30:06.860
The problem is the US government, go ahead.

30:06.860 --> 30:09.220
Well, any problems that we're experiencing

30:09.220 --> 30:10.780
regarding democracy right now,

30:11.740 --> 30:15.540
it's not a problem of democracy or of liberal government

30:15.540 --> 30:17.300
or of the types of governments that we have

30:17.300 --> 30:18.700
or anything like that.

30:18.700 --> 30:21.660
It's that there's something else going on with people

30:21.660 --> 30:24.420
and that the cracks in democracy are a symptom

30:24.420 --> 30:25.580
of a different problem

30:25.580 --> 30:27.660
and changing government won't fix that.

30:29.460 --> 30:31.660
Are you, how would it not fix that?

30:32.740 --> 30:34.980
Because not everything comes from the state.

30:35.900 --> 30:38.660
Okay, not everything, but the state could,

30:38.660 --> 30:40.060
dude, if the state wanted to,

30:40.060 --> 30:42.460
if the US government wanted to clean up the mess

30:42.460 --> 30:45.420
that we are in today, they very easily could

30:45.420 --> 30:47.180
if the right person was in office

30:47.180 --> 30:50.380
and decided to do that, but they won't.

30:50.380 --> 30:51.220
They won't fix it.

30:51.220 --> 30:52.420
They don't care.

30:52.420 --> 30:54.860
They're okay feeding the citizens slop

30:54.860 --> 30:57.940
until revolution transpires, and that's who they are.

30:57.940 --> 30:59.940
They don't care about you.

31:00.820 --> 31:03.460
You've said slop a lot, but where's the slop?

31:03.460 --> 31:06.740
In every regard, I've been laying it out.

31:06.740 --> 31:09.380
Look at our society, you stupid dude.

31:09.380 --> 31:10.460
It's filthy.

31:11.380 --> 31:13.500
Okay, so you can't go to the grocery store

31:13.540 --> 31:15.700
and buy broccoli instead of a hamburger?

31:15.700 --> 31:18.980
Like you guys have broccoli in America, don't you?

31:18.980 --> 31:20.860
Broccoli is good for you.

31:20.860 --> 31:24.460
What, oh, sir, you don't have broccoli in Canada?

31:24.460 --> 31:25.300
Yeah, we have broccoli.

31:25.300 --> 31:26.140
I eat it every day.

31:26.140 --> 31:26.960
It's good for you.

31:26.960 --> 31:27.800
It's healthy.

31:27.800 --> 31:28.740
It's not slop.

31:28.740 --> 31:30.780
Oh, the broccoli is not slop, man.

31:30.780 --> 31:33.140
Okay, that's obviously not what I'm talking about though.

31:33.140 --> 31:34.700
What are you talking about?

31:34.700 --> 31:36.900
Do you mean like cultural slop or not food?

31:36.900 --> 31:37.740
Is that what you mean?

31:37.740 --> 31:40.940
No, slop in all these different regards, man.

31:40.940 --> 31:42.980
Like with the media as an example,

31:43.300 --> 31:44.340
they feed you gray slop.

31:44.340 --> 31:46.620
Our justice system, which isn't about justice,

31:46.620 --> 31:48.500
feeds the citizens gray slop.

31:48.500 --> 31:51.420
The government that's ran by a senile child sniffer

31:51.420 --> 31:55.160
is in a sense feeding the citizens gray slop.

31:55.160 --> 32:00.160
Like our economic system, which is tremendously unjust

32:00.780 --> 32:02.460
in some degree, in my opinion.

32:02.460 --> 32:05.200
Yeah, I think that's feeding the citizens gray slop.

32:05.200 --> 32:06.040
Yeah.

32:06.040 --> 32:07.720
Are you going for a socialist revolution now

32:07.720 --> 32:09.380
or are you talking about the economic system?

32:10.680 --> 32:11.520
Oh, I'm saying that.

32:11.960 --> 32:14.600
I'm saying that if you've got, hold on, hold on, hold on.

32:14.600 --> 32:17.440
I literally agree that if you've got mass wealth inequality

32:17.440 --> 32:19.200
to the point where everything is horrible,

32:19.200 --> 32:21.080
then yeah, that's a problem.

32:21.080 --> 32:24.480
So, and obviously if you have mass wealth inequality

32:24.480 --> 32:26.760
to the point where everybody is dying

32:26.760 --> 32:30.440
and people have to like work like as slaves

32:30.440 --> 32:33.440
and it's like the slaves are revolting

32:33.440 --> 32:36.040
and it's like totally unjust and everybody knows it

32:36.040 --> 32:38.400
and such, like that's obviously an issue.

32:38.400 --> 32:40.380
That's obviously not gonna be productive for any nation.

32:40.380 --> 32:41.220
Go ahead.

32:41.940 --> 32:44.420
I figured a fascist doesn't mind inequality

32:44.420 --> 32:45.720
as a general rule.

32:46.580 --> 32:47.420
Well, sure.

32:47.420 --> 32:50.780
Yeah, I mean, but I'm not a fascist necessarily, so.

32:50.780 --> 32:53.300
You just advocated for a fascist government.

32:53.300 --> 32:55.380
Okay, but again, I'm not a fascist necessarily.

32:55.380 --> 32:56.980
I mean, you could advocate for a fascist government

32:56.980 --> 32:58.620
and not be a fascist, right?

32:58.620 --> 32:59.980
Here's the, here's where I-

32:59.980 --> 33:01.180
Is it like your second choice?

33:01.180 --> 33:02.740
Like, what do you mean?

33:02.740 --> 33:05.340
This is the like breakdown in communication

33:05.340 --> 33:07.380
every single time I have this conversation with them

33:07.380 --> 33:10.860
because this isn't me and this guy's like first conversation.

33:11.660 --> 33:12.480
Okay.

33:12.480 --> 33:13.500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

33:13.500 --> 33:18.500
So like, he doesn't have a holistic like worldview

33:20.220 --> 33:24.460
that he wants to see like put out there necessarily.

33:24.460 --> 33:26.660
He just doesn't like what's going on right now.

33:26.660 --> 33:30.740
He doesn't have a form of government

33:30.740 --> 33:33.920
that he particularly like enjoys,

33:33.920 --> 33:35.340
but he just won like,

33:35.340 --> 33:37.620
except for like some sort of authoritarian state.

33:37.620 --> 33:40.580
Like he sucks off like current Russia

33:40.580 --> 33:43.980
and like communist China pretty hardcore

33:43.980 --> 33:47.020
because I, fuck, I don't know.

33:47.020 --> 33:51.420
But like he claims to want freedom of speech,

33:51.420 --> 33:54.780
but he also loves like the like tamping down

33:54.780 --> 33:57.940
of political opposition like they do in Russia and China.

33:57.940 --> 34:01.220
So like there's this like big amorphous political system

34:01.220 --> 34:04.020
that he like kind of more enjoys,

34:04.020 --> 34:06.100
but it's largely predicated on just like-

34:06.100 --> 34:08.940
I want good things and I don't like bad things

34:08.940 --> 34:12.060
and the bad things need to be like tamped out

34:12.060 --> 34:13.740
with like brutal efficiency

34:13.740 --> 34:16.340
and the good things need to be implemented

34:16.340 --> 34:21.140
so that we can have whatever the good is.

34:21.140 --> 34:22.740
I think I understand, I think I understand.

34:22.740 --> 34:24.540
I mean, I don't know how you get the hyper efficiency

34:24.540 --> 34:26.060
without any sort of competition, right?

34:26.060 --> 34:28.860
Like any kind of command economy or command structure

34:28.860 --> 34:31.060
generally leads to lack of inefficiency

34:31.060 --> 34:33.460
because there's no competition pressure.

34:33.460 --> 34:34.300
True.

34:34.300 --> 34:37.060
Well, who's the competition for the US government?

34:38.380 --> 34:39.820
Well, that is the problem.

34:39.820 --> 34:41.420
It's the parties within

34:41.420 --> 34:44.380
and the like sub factions within those parties

34:44.380 --> 34:45.220
is the argument.

34:45.220 --> 34:48.140
I don't know if Dev agrees with that, but.

34:48.140 --> 34:49.860
There's no competition for that.

34:49.860 --> 34:51.620
If there was a breakaway state

34:51.620 --> 34:53.260
that actually competed with the government

34:53.260 --> 34:56.460
and fixed the laws and like actually raised the children

34:56.460 --> 34:57.300
and taught them good things.

34:57.300 --> 34:58.860
Well, breakaway state would be like fixing

34:58.860 --> 35:00.500
the like system itself.

35:00.500 --> 35:02.340
It would just be, you know,

35:02.340 --> 35:04.940
that you are advocating for revolution at that point.

35:05.820 --> 35:07.580
I'm saying, well, then maybe that is

35:07.580 --> 35:08.420
what I'm advocating for.

35:08.420 --> 35:10.260
I mean, I'm advocating to,

35:10.260 --> 35:12.300
I'm trying to make people's lives better.

35:12.300 --> 35:13.700
And I'm saying that this,

35:13.700 --> 35:16.580
the way we're living now is unacceptable.

35:16.580 --> 35:19.500
The way we're living now is it doesn't even make sense.

35:19.500 --> 35:20.340
It's horrible.

35:20.340 --> 35:21.180
It's bizarre.

35:21.180 --> 35:23.460
Everything is a land of injustice.

35:23.460 --> 35:24.820
So many of the problems that you bring up,

35:24.820 --> 35:25.940
I don't think are problems

35:25.940 --> 35:28.620
that the average person actually deals with, right?

35:28.620 --> 35:29.460
I feel like-

35:29.460 --> 35:31.180
It is, I just dealt with injustice, man.

35:31.900 --> 35:33.020
That's what I was about to say.

35:33.020 --> 35:34.140
People that are fed through-

35:34.140 --> 35:35.580
No, you are not the average person.

35:35.580 --> 35:37.180
You are you, right?

35:37.180 --> 35:38.220
But like the average person,

35:38.220 --> 35:40.460
like in the past, you know,

35:40.460 --> 35:42.380
ever since I stopped streaming full time,

35:42.380 --> 35:43.940
like I've touched a lot of grass.

35:43.940 --> 35:45.940
I've met a lot of people who are actual

35:45.940 --> 35:47.580
like regular people, right?

35:47.580 --> 35:48.620
And they don't talk about like

35:48.620 --> 35:49.900
the government's feeding a slot.

35:49.900 --> 35:51.460
They don't fucking like feel like

35:51.460 --> 35:53.780
that's what the big issues in the country are, right?

35:53.780 --> 35:56.340
They're worried about like the fact that

35:56.340 --> 35:57.460
like if they're liberals,

35:57.460 --> 36:01.060
they feel like the government is being,

36:01.060 --> 36:03.980
like attempted to be taken over by like fascist factions.

36:03.980 --> 36:04.820
Yeah, because-

36:04.820 --> 36:05.660
If you're on the right wing,

36:05.660 --> 36:06.500
if you're on the right wing,

36:06.500 --> 36:08.900
then you believe that like the liberals

36:08.900 --> 36:13.900
are using like bad intentions

36:13.900 --> 36:18.700
to try and like circumvent the laws to steal elections.

36:18.700 --> 36:21.020
But like more personally to them,

36:21.020 --> 36:23.020
the average person is more concerned

36:23.020 --> 36:25.220
with like the meat and potato issues,

36:25.220 --> 36:26.500
as much as I hate to call them that.

36:26.500 --> 36:29.420
Like, you know, inflation, cost of living,

36:29.460 --> 36:31.900
you know, how expensive it is to afford a house,

36:31.900 --> 36:33.220
how difficult it is to find a job.

36:33.220 --> 36:35.580
They might not believe that revolution is possible.

36:35.580 --> 36:36.420
I mean, I'm much younger than-

36:36.420 --> 36:39.460
No, most people don't want revolution.

36:39.460 --> 36:41.300
Yeah, that's true.

36:41.300 --> 36:42.580
There's a lot of older people

36:42.580 --> 36:44.140
that do not support revolution,

36:44.140 --> 36:46.340
but I think you're gonna see really the young people.

36:46.340 --> 36:49.940
Do you think I hang out with a bunch of like anti-communist

36:49.940 --> 36:53.620
or anti-fascists, like 70 year olds?

36:53.620 --> 36:56.060
Maybe people don't support, maybe people don't.

36:56.060 --> 36:57.460
I do think there are a lot of people

36:57.460 --> 36:58.740
that, more now so than ever,

36:58.900 --> 37:00.060
that do support revolution.

37:00.060 --> 37:01.700
But I think a lot of people might believe

37:01.700 --> 37:03.900
revolution's unreasonable or can never happen

37:03.900 --> 37:04.740
or these sort of things,

37:04.740 --> 37:06.620
or they're just not capable of it

37:06.620 --> 37:07.980
or things of like that nature.

37:07.980 --> 37:09.540
So, you know, there's plenty of reasons

37:09.540 --> 37:12.540
why they'd focus more on less substantial issues

37:12.540 --> 37:15.220
than total revolution, but I'm going for it all

37:15.220 --> 37:18.300
in the sense that I see everything broken with the US.

37:18.300 --> 37:21.460
I can see this whole, the US government is an operation.

37:21.460 --> 37:24.060
You have to view it like an operation.

37:24.060 --> 37:25.240
Probably other countries too,

37:25.240 --> 37:26.500
but especially the US government,

37:26.500 --> 37:27.820
that's all I really know about.

37:27.820 --> 37:30.780
And they're an operation that doesn't know how to,

37:30.780 --> 37:32.820
like they're bad operators.

37:32.820 --> 37:34.740
These operators are like taking the train

37:34.740 --> 37:38.380
down the wrong railroad and I'm screaming at them,

37:38.380 --> 37:41.020
do what's right, take it down the right path.

37:41.020 --> 37:41.840
And they-

37:41.840 --> 37:42.680
Hey, hold on, hold on.

37:42.680 --> 37:43.600
I wanna drill down on this.

37:43.600 --> 37:46.780
How do you know that what you think is right

37:46.780 --> 37:47.980
is actually right?

37:49.980 --> 37:52.820
Well, I think that, well, right is a,

37:52.820 --> 37:55.220
we can go into the whole morality conversation

37:55.220 --> 37:56.540
if you want to, but I think-

37:56.540 --> 37:58.260
We have to, because you're saying,

37:58.260 --> 37:59.700
do what's right over and over.

37:59.700 --> 38:01.060
That's like your main point,

38:01.060 --> 38:02.380
you have to live in that conversation.

38:02.380 --> 38:05.780
Well, I mean, we do to some degree, I guess maybe,

38:05.780 --> 38:09.100
but mostly I'm just talking about results being produced.

38:09.100 --> 38:11.380
I'm talking about just like normal,

38:11.380 --> 38:13.040
good things happening to people.

38:13.040 --> 38:15.540
Like I'm not, I don't wanna go like nitty gritty

38:15.540 --> 38:16.940
about moral issues.

38:16.940 --> 38:19.940
It's good if people are living, people are prosperous,

38:19.940 --> 38:22.500
people are successful, people are happy,

38:22.500 --> 38:26.220
people trust the government and the government trusts them.

38:26.740 --> 38:27.580
Like these sort of things.

38:27.580 --> 38:30.460
Like people are, people feel like they're living in like a-

38:30.460 --> 38:31.380
A utopia.

38:33.060 --> 38:35.740
Honest place, I guess, to some degree, I'd say,

38:35.740 --> 38:37.340
where it's not the core,

38:37.340 --> 38:40.060
it's not McDonald's arches ruling the society

38:40.060 --> 38:42.660
and mass injustice transpiring, but rather-

38:42.660 --> 38:45.040
God is telling us to comment on this, holy fuck.

38:45.040 --> 38:45.880
No, I get it.

38:45.880 --> 38:50.360
So you want a return to like the 1950s high trust society

38:50.360 --> 38:52.340
where you could walk down the streets of New York

38:52.340 --> 38:54.340
and not get fucking mugged or like stop-

38:54.340 --> 38:57.020
Well, I think there are countries

38:57.020 --> 38:58.620
that have already erased crime.

38:58.620 --> 39:01.100
There are countries where crime, there is no crime.

39:01.100 --> 39:03.400
Our government isn't capable of erasing crime,

39:03.400 --> 39:05.420
but it's already happened in other places.

39:05.420 --> 39:09.060
And I believe it's possible to produce a society

39:09.060 --> 39:10.860
where there is no crime.

39:10.860 --> 39:14.260
Great, so you want that high trust society back

39:14.260 --> 39:18.140
where it's like I said, you could walk down the road

39:18.140 --> 39:20.260
in a city and not get mugged by a random person.

39:20.260 --> 39:22.220
There's not random violence in the streets.

39:22.260 --> 39:25.100
You see videos of random violence go viral all the time

39:25.100 --> 39:27.300
on TikTok, that's what you're talking about, right?

39:27.300 --> 39:28.140
Yeah, it's horrible.

39:28.140 --> 39:29.220
Yeah, I think that's horrible.

39:29.220 --> 39:31.060
So here's the thing,

39:31.060 --> 39:35.000
authoritarian systems always destroy high trust societies

39:35.000 --> 39:37.260
because everyone's an informant for the party.

39:37.260 --> 39:38.720
A fascist state wouldn't do this.

39:38.720 --> 39:39.940
It would do the opposite of it.

39:39.940 --> 39:42.460
It would make everyone distrustful of everyone else

39:42.460 --> 39:44.720
because that guy might be a snitch.

39:47.760 --> 39:50.660
I disagree that that's what necessarily would happen.

39:50.660 --> 39:53.020
Can you give an example of a fascist government

39:53.020 --> 39:54.940
or like a highly authoritarian government

39:54.940 --> 39:56.460
that that didn't happen in?

39:56.460 --> 39:59.740
There wasn't like, I mean, to some degree,

39:59.740 --> 40:03.400
there's always gonna be trust in an authoritarian country.

40:03.400 --> 40:07.900
I mean, I'd probably argue, but I mean,

40:07.900 --> 40:10.220
you're saying it's just less trust than,

40:10.220 --> 40:13.100
you would literally argue that we, like,

40:14.580 --> 40:16.140
I mean, within any government,

40:16.140 --> 40:18.580
there's gonna be levels of trust.

40:18.580 --> 40:20.620
If we're just talking about trust,

40:20.620 --> 40:24.020
but you would argue that like a fascist state,

40:24.020 --> 40:26.020
there would be less trust amongst the people

40:26.020 --> 40:27.740
than what we have now?

40:27.740 --> 40:29.020
Yes.

40:29.020 --> 40:31.800
No, well, it's not necessarily about trust

40:31.800 --> 40:33.460
within the government.

40:33.460 --> 40:34.660
I mean, that's a different conversation,

40:34.660 --> 40:35.700
but I think that you could produce,

40:35.700 --> 40:37.660
I think there could be a fascist state

40:37.660 --> 40:38.860
where people have trust in the government.

40:38.860 --> 40:40.540
Probably people had trust in the government

40:40.540 --> 40:41.640
in the Nazi state,

40:43.180 --> 40:46.060
but it's more about the people's,

40:46.060 --> 40:48.380
I'd say it's more about the people's trust in government

40:49.020 --> 40:49.860
than anything, I think.

40:49.860 --> 40:50.820
But even then, it would be destroyed,

40:50.820 --> 40:54.620
because for example, it's very easy in Nazi Germany

40:54.620 --> 40:56.640
for one person to just trust their neighbors,

40:56.640 --> 40:59.100
because who knows if they're hiding something

40:59.100 --> 41:00.380
that they should be reporting,

41:00.380 --> 41:02.900
or if their neighbor's gonna report on them.

41:02.900 --> 41:04.940
Who knows if that's happening in America today?

41:04.940 --> 41:07.640
And you're talking about reporting, like what kind of,

41:07.640 --> 41:09.540
yeah, that's, what are you talking about reporting?

41:09.540 --> 41:10.900
Listen, listen, listen, okay, okay, so,

41:10.900 --> 41:13.020
do you call back- What if somebody reports,

41:13.020 --> 41:13.860
what if somebody reports,

41:13.860 --> 41:16.780
what if I report my neighbor for being black,

41:16.780 --> 41:18.300
or just cause I don't like him or something?

41:19.180 --> 41:20.020
What are you talking about, reporting?

41:20.020 --> 41:20.840
Well, nothing's gonna happen

41:20.840 --> 41:21.940
because you live in a democracy, right?

41:21.940 --> 41:24.780
But do you recall, hold on, do you recall back-

41:24.780 --> 41:26.140
How do you know nothing's gonna happen?

41:26.140 --> 41:27.300
What happened to George Floyd?

41:27.300 --> 41:28.700
They pulled up and killed him,

41:28.700 --> 41:30.540
and we live in a democracy, right?

41:31.460 --> 41:32.660
Yeah, let's not get started on that one,

41:32.660 --> 41:35.200
because I probably have a spicier take on that than you do.

41:35.200 --> 41:37.780
But, but hold on, hold on.

41:37.780 --> 41:41.100
So, do you recall back during the,

41:41.100 --> 41:44.220
let's say the first third of the pandemic,

41:44.220 --> 41:47.140
there was a big uproar because having,

41:47.180 --> 41:48.460
at least in some countries, in some,

41:48.460 --> 41:49.300
I don't know about the states,

41:49.300 --> 41:51.180
but definitely in Canada, definitely in the UK,

41:51.180 --> 41:53.940
having more than like six or five people in your house

41:53.940 --> 41:55.420
was considered a crime.

41:55.420 --> 41:57.760
And so you had people snitching on their neighbors,

41:57.760 --> 41:58.600
being like, listen, officer-

41:58.600 --> 42:00.300
That happened in the US too, yeah.

42:00.300 --> 42:01.220
That happened in the US?

42:01.220 --> 42:02.060
Yeah, for sure.

42:02.060 --> 42:03.420
Yeah, see, but here's the thing.

42:04.380 --> 42:09.300
A democracy like the US, like Canada, like the UK,

42:09.300 --> 42:11.660
these democratic liberal countries

42:11.660 --> 42:14.180
only started becoming low trust

42:14.180 --> 42:17.300
to the point that you had neighbors snitching on neighbors

42:17.300 --> 42:19.700
when the government became more authoritarian

42:19.700 --> 42:21.480
to enforce these lockdown rules.

42:25.760 --> 42:27.380
The neighbors only snitched on neighbors

42:27.380 --> 42:29.060
when the government became more authoritarian

42:29.060 --> 42:30.620
to support the lockdown rules?

42:30.620 --> 42:31.440
Yes.

42:33.100 --> 42:35.280
Well, people probably snitched on their neighbors

42:35.280 --> 42:36.700
before that, but I mean,

42:36.700 --> 42:38.900
these aren't authoritarian countries,

42:38.900 --> 42:42.080
these are democracies where people are snitching.

42:42.080 --> 42:42.920
Yeah, but here's the thing.

42:42.960 --> 42:44.400
What is the argument exactly?

42:44.400 --> 42:45.800
You're saying they're democracies

42:45.800 --> 42:48.480
that operate as authoritarian style societies

42:48.480 --> 42:50.440
and then people are snitching.

42:50.440 --> 42:52.400
So therefore authoritarianism is bad?

42:52.400 --> 42:55.120
Like how naive is, how retarded naive is that?

42:55.120 --> 42:58.320
So the argument is that a lot of right-wing people,

42:58.320 --> 43:00.240
correctly in my opinion,

43:00.240 --> 43:02.080
said that democratic government-

43:02.080 --> 43:04.760
The snitching, hold on, the snitching has nothing to do-

43:04.760 --> 43:05.600
Hold on, just a sec.

43:05.600 --> 43:08.420
The snitching has nothing to do with democracy

43:08.420 --> 43:11.320
or any of it, authoritarianism or any of it.

43:11.320 --> 43:12.160
It actually does.

43:12.240 --> 43:13.080
It does not, sir.

43:13.080 --> 43:13.920
It does not.

43:13.920 --> 43:14.740
I'll explain it to you.

43:14.740 --> 43:15.580
I'll explain how it does, okay?

43:15.580 --> 43:20.580
So the right wing correctly criticized liberal governments

43:20.640 --> 43:22.560
for becoming more authoritarian

43:22.560 --> 43:25.620
as they implemented more harsh lockdown measures

43:25.620 --> 43:26.920
during COVID.

43:26.920 --> 43:29.320
That was a correct assessment of the situation.

43:29.320 --> 43:31.680
And a lot of people who are, let's say,

43:31.680 --> 43:33.420
more classically liberal, like me,

43:33.420 --> 43:35.280
were worried for a time that some of this stuff

43:35.280 --> 43:38.060
might actually remain in place for long periods.

43:38.060 --> 43:39.720
Turns out it didn't, that's good.

43:39.760 --> 43:44.520
But in a more free society,

43:44.520 --> 43:48.660
there's no impetus to snitch on someone, right?

43:48.660 --> 43:51.800
Like if you have a more authoritarian society

43:51.800 --> 43:53.620
where the government can come in

43:53.620 --> 43:57.840
and arrest people for mundane things

43:57.840 --> 43:58.680
like having to-

43:58.680 --> 44:01.640
You're not understanding what authoritarianism

44:01.640 --> 44:03.560
actually is or means, but okay.

44:04.540 --> 44:07.120
So real authoritarianism has never been tried?

44:07.120 --> 44:08.600
When they're arresting those people,

44:08.640 --> 44:10.600
that's on the back of democracy.

44:10.600 --> 44:12.960
That's not on authoritarianism, right?

44:12.960 --> 44:14.840
You're saying that, what are you saying?

44:14.840 --> 44:16.200
I'm confused.

44:16.200 --> 44:17.440
I mean, do you believe that,

44:17.440 --> 44:18.800
why are they arresting those people?

44:18.800 --> 44:20.320
You're saying because of fascism,

44:20.320 --> 44:22.020
they're snitching on their neighbor?

44:22.020 --> 44:23.560
Are you retarded?

44:23.560 --> 44:25.880
Fascism doesn't produce snitching on their neighbor

44:25.880 --> 44:26.720
necessarily. Hold on, let him speak

44:26.720 --> 44:27.600
because you're not understanding a word he's saying

44:27.600 --> 44:28.440
because everything he's saying-

44:28.440 --> 44:29.360
No, fascism does not.

44:29.360 --> 44:32.560
Oh, he's saying fascism produces this snitch style society.

44:32.560 --> 44:33.400
And I'm saying that that is-

44:33.400 --> 44:35.240
No, he said authoritarianism does.

44:35.240 --> 44:36.080
Okay, whatever.

44:36.080 --> 44:36.920
Okay, that's authoritarianism.

44:36.920 --> 44:37.960
Because socialist governments do it too.

44:38.320 --> 44:39.160
Socialist governments do it too.

44:39.160 --> 44:43.320
So for example, I actually know a YouTuber in Romania

44:43.320 --> 44:46.480
who has described the low trust society

44:46.480 --> 44:49.800
he finds himself in after several generations

44:49.800 --> 44:50.880
of communist rule.

44:50.880 --> 44:52.560
Authoritarian societies,

44:52.560 --> 44:54.580
because of the fact that they're authoritarian,

44:54.580 --> 44:55.840
they have secret police,

44:55.840 --> 44:57.960
they have very strict laws and regulations.

44:57.960 --> 45:01.560
These societies produce a low trust society.

45:01.560 --> 45:05.080
And the reason is, is because you have people

45:05.080 --> 45:07.080
who are snitching on other people.

45:07.080 --> 45:09.640
Citizens don't trust each other because-

45:09.640 --> 45:11.080
Do we trust each other here?

45:12.120 --> 45:13.600
No, you don't.

45:13.600 --> 45:15.600
I think you could produce a fascist state

45:15.600 --> 45:17.640
or authoritarian state where people trust each other

45:17.640 --> 45:20.600
literally 20 times more than what we have now, sir.

45:20.600 --> 45:21.840
I don't think it's possible.

45:21.840 --> 45:23.920
I think that's very easily done.

45:23.920 --> 45:25.800
You're so naive if you think that.

45:25.800 --> 45:27.680
People don't trust each other now.

45:27.680 --> 45:31.040
People don't trust each other with democracy right now.

45:31.040 --> 45:32.760
People snitch on each other

45:32.760 --> 45:34.520
because they think it's funny in our country.

45:34.520 --> 45:37.320
Because in that kind of country,

45:39.520 --> 45:42.000
some snitching is justified.

45:42.000 --> 45:43.840
But I don't think there would necessarily be

45:43.840 --> 45:45.600
these authoritarian style laws

45:45.600 --> 45:47.400
where people would be snitching on each other

45:47.400 --> 45:49.440
in a fascist state.

45:49.440 --> 45:51.240
I just can't imagine.

45:51.240 --> 45:52.240
If it's a fascist state,

45:52.240 --> 45:55.240
how are they gonna produce those sort of things?

45:55.240 --> 45:56.440
You would think that they would be running

45:56.440 --> 45:58.360
a better operation than everybody going around

45:58.360 --> 46:00.920
snitching on each other in these tiny regards.

46:00.920 --> 46:03.040
Well, how do they get the information though?

46:03.040 --> 46:04.680
How do they get the information?

46:04.680 --> 46:07.080
Here, let's say that in fascist America,

46:07.080 --> 46:09.120
let's say I'm living in fascist America, okay?

46:09.120 --> 46:10.920
Your idealized fascist America.

46:10.920 --> 46:13.000
And I'm running some sort of underground group.

46:13.000 --> 46:15.720
I have like a secret liberal group where we get together

46:15.720 --> 46:17.560
and maybe trade banned liberal books.

46:17.560 --> 46:19.440
And we talk about one day

46:19.440 --> 46:20.960
reinstituting a liberal government.

46:20.960 --> 46:25.600
You would have to have a snitch in my operation

46:25.600 --> 46:27.640
to actually come in and stop me.

46:27.640 --> 46:28.480
Well, sure.

46:28.480 --> 46:30.080
I mean, if it was a fascist state to the degree

46:30.080 --> 46:34.600
where they're banning books and they're like, you know,

46:34.600 --> 46:37.080
but I mean, I think that if the books are really bad,

46:37.080 --> 46:38.560
then they probably should be banned.

46:38.560 --> 46:41.200
So you probably do deserve to be snitched on.

46:41.200 --> 46:42.760
I mean, to your degree,

46:42.760 --> 46:44.480
some snitching is always justified.

46:44.480 --> 46:46.880
Some snitching can be justified.

46:46.880 --> 46:49.280
It depends what we're talking about,

46:49.280 --> 46:52.160
but generally I think the answer to that is no.

46:53.400 --> 46:55.400
Snitching can never be justified?

46:55.400 --> 46:57.160
Not never, but generally.

46:57.160 --> 46:59.800
So for example, I wouldn't snitch on my friend

47:00.400 --> 47:01.240
if he managed-

47:01.240 --> 47:02.080
You would have better laws where-

47:02.080 --> 47:02.920
Hold on, hold on.

47:02.920 --> 47:03.740
You could have better-

47:03.740 --> 47:04.580
Hold on, hold on.

47:04.580 --> 47:05.400
Hold on, hold on.

47:05.400 --> 47:06.240
Holy shit.

47:06.240 --> 47:07.080
No, no, no.

47:07.080 --> 47:07.920
Cause he's not, cause he's not,

47:07.920 --> 47:08.760
everything he says is retarded.

47:08.760 --> 47:09.580
You could have better laws

47:09.580 --> 47:11.480
where less snitching actually transpires

47:11.480 --> 47:13.560
in an authoritarian style country.

47:13.560 --> 47:15.080
Like you're saying,

47:15.080 --> 47:16.520
because the laws could,

47:16.520 --> 47:18.360
the kind of society, the operation-

47:18.360 --> 47:20.880
Anti-snitching laws in a fucking fascist society?

47:20.880 --> 47:24.560
An operation could be run where there is the snitch,

47:24.560 --> 47:27.160
snitching isn't a thing where nobody wants to snitch,

47:27.160 --> 47:28.760
where it doesn't even make sense to snitch.

47:28.760 --> 47:30.320
There is nobody to snitch to.

47:30.320 --> 47:31.160
And-

47:31.160 --> 47:33.640
In an authoritarian government?

47:33.640 --> 47:35.720
So how does the government get the information

47:35.720 --> 47:38.120
that it needs then if no one's snitching?

47:38.120 --> 47:41.560
What's, how do they get the information they need?

47:41.560 --> 47:42.400
Yeah.

47:42.400 --> 47:43.220
What kind of government?

47:43.220 --> 47:44.700
The authoritarian government?

47:44.700 --> 47:45.760
Yes.

47:45.760 --> 47:46.880
In your idealized government.

47:46.880 --> 47:47.720
Okay.

47:47.720 --> 47:48.680
Your idealized system,

47:48.680 --> 47:49.720
there's no snitching,

47:49.720 --> 47:50.840
but it's a fascist state.

47:50.840 --> 47:51.680
Okay.

47:51.680 --> 47:53.620
How does the fascist state get the information

47:53.620 --> 47:54.800
that it needs from people

47:54.800 --> 47:57.160
if no one's telling them anything?

47:57.200 --> 48:00.680
Well, I mean, obviously they have to talk about something.

48:00.680 --> 48:02.840
Like if somebody breaks a law, man,

48:02.840 --> 48:04.280
then snitching has to happen

48:04.280 --> 48:06.200
no matter what country you're in, right?

48:06.200 --> 48:08.020
You agree with that, right?

48:08.020 --> 48:08.860
Sure.

48:08.860 --> 48:09.920
And here's the thing, like, for example,

48:09.920 --> 48:11.240
I would probably snitch on my friend

48:11.240 --> 48:12.540
if he murdered someone.

48:12.540 --> 48:14.600
But if my friend got away with a speeding ticket,

48:14.600 --> 48:15.800
I wouldn't snitch on him.

48:17.320 --> 48:18.840
If he got away with a speeding ticket,

48:18.840 --> 48:19.680
or what do you mean got away?

48:19.680 --> 48:20.520
As in, if he-

48:20.520 --> 48:22.640
Or ran from the police and got away or something?

48:22.640 --> 48:25.440
Yeah, like if it was like a misdemeanor crime

48:25.440 --> 48:26.320
and he got away with it,

48:26.320 --> 48:28.600
and there's no danger of him being caught,

48:28.600 --> 48:30.000
I wouldn't tell the cops, no.

48:31.860 --> 48:33.120
Oh, well, maybe you should then.

48:33.120 --> 48:34.720
If it was a misdemeanor, maybe then.

48:34.720 --> 48:36.600
Yeah, I mean, but that could easily happen

48:36.600 --> 48:37.440
in an authoritarian state.

48:37.440 --> 48:38.260
It depends on the crime, right?

48:38.260 --> 48:39.100
It depends on the crime.

48:39.100 --> 48:40.600
Why do you think, you know,

48:40.600 --> 48:43.760
it could be more unlikely for somebody to snitch

48:43.760 --> 48:46.260
in that exact example in an authoritarian state

48:46.260 --> 48:49.780
because of, it could be more harsher and-

48:49.780 --> 48:50.620
Go ahead.

48:50.620 --> 48:51.440
I can describe it to you.

48:51.440 --> 48:56.240
So the fundamental issue is that authoritarian states,

48:57.120 --> 49:01.240
they have to take behavior that is relatively normal

49:01.240 --> 49:02.960
and make it illegal.

49:02.960 --> 49:06.160
And the reason that they have such wide,

49:07.440 --> 49:09.520
like secret police apparatuses,

49:09.520 --> 49:14.520
is because in order to get people to not do normal things,

49:14.880 --> 49:17.640
you have to have some sort of,

49:17.640 --> 49:20.520
well, here, this happened in East Germany.

49:20.520 --> 49:24.820
Well, what kind of normal behavior has to be illegal

49:24.820 --> 49:25.660
in a fascist state?

49:25.980 --> 49:30.140
Tell me what exact normal, what exact normal behavior.

49:30.140 --> 49:32.460
Yeah, harboring Jews is a big one.

49:32.460 --> 49:33.700
But here's the thing,

49:33.700 --> 49:35.300
I can give you an example from a communist.

49:35.300 --> 49:36.860
It's normal to harbor Jews.

49:36.860 --> 49:38.660
It's normal to harbor Jews.

49:38.660 --> 49:41.420
If they're being exterminated, yes, you should do that.

49:42.560 --> 49:45.660
Let's not go super down this rabbit hole

49:45.660 --> 49:47.660
because I feel, I have a feeling I'm afraid here.

49:47.660 --> 49:49.820
You don't think anything could justify their extermination?

49:49.820 --> 49:51.480
Ah, let's be real.

49:51.480 --> 49:52.320
Let's be real.

49:52.320 --> 49:53.300
Let's move past.

49:54.300 --> 49:56.080
Wait, are you talking about?

49:57.140 --> 49:58.420
Yeah, he's full JQ.

50:00.100 --> 50:02.540
Okay, listen, I can give you an example from East Germany.

50:02.540 --> 50:05.740
Okay, communist state, just as authoritarian, okay?

50:05.740 --> 50:09.820
So they had to outlaw ownership.

50:09.820 --> 50:13.160
I think they had to outlaw ownership of multiple properties.

50:13.160 --> 50:15.900
So for example, you couldn't own two houses, right?

50:15.900 --> 50:17.720
And what they had to do is like,

50:17.720 --> 50:22.180
well, how can you tell that this house is owned

50:22.220 --> 50:24.940
by somebody else without someone informing, right?

50:24.940 --> 50:27.620
One of the reasons that East Germany

50:27.620 --> 50:30.620
had the most extensive secret police in the world

50:30.620 --> 50:32.720
is because they were literally using it

50:32.720 --> 50:35.180
to track people's purchases and discover,

50:35.180 --> 50:38.020
hey, like, are you buying things

50:38.020 --> 50:41.300
that you shouldn't be buying with your paycheck?

50:41.300 --> 50:43.540
That's extremely authoritarian.

50:43.540 --> 50:46.820
But that sort of authoritarian control of an economy

50:46.820 --> 50:49.740
requires massive amounts of data collection.

50:49.740 --> 50:51.580
So you have the secret police

50:51.860 --> 50:53.700
and you have informants.

50:53.700 --> 50:55.140
That's why something like in Romania,

50:55.140 --> 50:57.940
something like one fourth of all citizens

50:57.940 --> 51:00.860
at one point was a government informant, you know?

51:00.860 --> 51:04.100
These top-down overarching systems

51:04.100 --> 51:07.940
have to have such ridiculous secret police systems.

51:07.940 --> 51:10.260
How many people work for the government in that regard?

51:10.260 --> 51:12.500
Like 25% of people.

51:12.500 --> 51:15.080
Yeah, 25%, one in four.

51:15.080 --> 51:19.260
Yeah, like you're saying two houses in a fascist state

51:19.260 --> 51:21.540
and then somebody snitches, like that's the least of them.

51:22.380 --> 51:24.220
This would be a communist.

51:24.220 --> 51:26.260
Or authoritarian state, whatever, communist state.

51:26.260 --> 51:29.300
It's two houses and somebody snitches is like,

51:29.300 --> 51:31.420
that means nothing to me, man.

51:31.420 --> 51:32.740
True, but here's what it is though,

51:32.740 --> 51:35.580
is that if you have enough money,

51:35.580 --> 51:38.220
buying two houses is a pretty normal thing to do.

51:38.220 --> 51:39.180
Who's to say that?

51:39.180 --> 51:43.740
Just let me explain, let me explain this.

51:43.740 --> 51:47.400
So what I was getting at is that authoritarian governments

51:47.400 --> 51:51.020
have to make some normal behaviors illegal.

51:51.420 --> 51:52.820
I disagree with that.

51:52.820 --> 51:53.980
That's where we disagree.

51:53.980 --> 51:56.260
I don't know where, can you give me an example?

51:56.260 --> 51:57.580
You're saying harboring Jews,

51:57.580 --> 51:58.940
but can you give me another example

51:58.940 --> 52:00.340
because we're on YouTube?

52:00.340 --> 52:01.860
Okay, so we're not gonna talk about the harboring Jews.

52:01.860 --> 52:04.740
That's your one, like, okay, there's the freebie.

52:04.740 --> 52:07.140
Okay, okay, because of YouTube, because of YouTube.

52:07.140 --> 52:10.300
Otherwise I would be open to taking that on, but okay.

52:10.300 --> 52:11.140
Okay, okay.

52:11.140 --> 52:13.920
I disagree, normal behaviors have to be illegal.

52:13.920 --> 52:16.600
I think you're naive to what a fascist state would be.

52:16.600 --> 52:18.300
I think even you-

52:18.340 --> 52:21.560
Would you make non-heterosexual sex illegal?

52:23.860 --> 52:26.380
Now you're asking me what my personal ideal is.

52:26.380 --> 52:28.500
Yes, your personal, because you're telling us

52:28.500 --> 52:29.740
what the good is. Your fascist state.

52:29.740 --> 52:31.300
Yeah, your fascist state.

52:31.300 --> 52:32.920
You're the leader.

52:32.920 --> 52:33.980
We're saying-

52:33.980 --> 52:36.100
You're the Fuhrer of your own state.

52:36.100 --> 52:37.620
Okay, okay.

52:37.620 --> 52:41.300
Would you make non-heterosexual sex illegal?

52:41.300 --> 52:43.420
I'm not saying I should be the Fuhrer.

52:43.420 --> 52:46.980
I'm not necessarily, like I said, I'm not necessarily-

52:47.020 --> 52:51.380
Would your ideal Fuhrer make non-heterosexual sex illegal?

52:54.820 --> 52:56.900
Non-heterosexual sex illegal.

52:56.900 --> 52:59.420
I think it's hard to say.

53:01.900 --> 53:04.420
I don't think so, no, I don't think so, no.

53:04.420 --> 53:07.620
Illegal is one thing,

53:07.620 --> 53:09.540
but the punishment of a legality

53:09.540 --> 53:10.860
is a whole other thing, right?

53:10.860 --> 53:14.060
So I think it wouldn't be bad

53:14.060 --> 53:16.020
if necessarily it was frowned upon.

53:16.060 --> 53:17.900
I wouldn't necessarily be so much against that,

53:17.900 --> 53:22.240
but illegal is, maybe you could say it's too far,

53:22.240 --> 53:25.600
but maybe there's some punishment is just,

53:25.600 --> 53:27.620
I mean, it depends.

53:27.620 --> 53:29.820
If it's legal, how can there be punishment?

53:34.020 --> 53:35.740
No, I'm not saying it to be legal.

53:35.740 --> 53:37.180
I'm saying it can be illegal,

53:37.180 --> 53:38.820
but maybe the punishment isn't,

53:38.820 --> 53:41.180
you kill the person obviously or something.

53:41.180 --> 53:43.580
But what's the punishment though?

53:44.580 --> 53:47.300
I don't know, you have to take classes,

53:47.300 --> 53:49.620
you have to figure out what's going on with you

53:49.620 --> 53:51.700
that would make you wanna engage

53:51.700 --> 53:52.660
in that type of behavior.

53:52.660 --> 53:54.660
I mean, there are ways to mitigate that behavior

53:54.660 --> 53:56.700
and however that can be best enacted in the law

53:56.700 --> 53:58.420
probably should be.

53:58.420 --> 54:01.900
Okay, so how would your government discover

54:01.900 --> 54:04.220
if somebody is having gay sex?

54:06.300 --> 54:08.040
I don't know, maybe somebody would inform

54:08.040 --> 54:10.540
somebody else about it, but I'm not saying that-

54:10.540 --> 54:12.020
So you'd have snitches.

54:12.020 --> 54:14.860
In regard to the gay sex thing and sexual degeneracy,

54:14.860 --> 54:17.460
I think that any amount of sexual degeneracy

54:17.460 --> 54:19.820
is gonna be normal to some degree in a society.

54:19.820 --> 54:22.420
And so, yeah, but if people were snitching,

54:22.420 --> 54:25.700
I mean, people snitch about bestiality in our society now.

54:25.700 --> 54:27.700
So snitching, you agreed to me earlier,

54:27.700 --> 54:31.240
snitching can be okay, but you don't like snitching

54:31.240 --> 54:33.440
when it conflates with your personal moral views

54:33.440 --> 54:34.820
of the world.

54:34.820 --> 54:38.060
And so- Yes, but it's the same thing with you though.

54:38.060 --> 54:42.140
Sir, but sometimes your personal,

54:42.140 --> 54:43.860
sometimes that snitching is justified

54:43.860 --> 54:47.040
whether it's your personal view of the world or not.

54:47.040 --> 54:49.500
And so- Okay, if that's the case,

54:49.500 --> 54:52.540
how is snitching on a person having gay sex justified?

54:53.780 --> 54:56.220
I'm not saying that that necessarily is justified.

54:56.220 --> 54:59.780
I'm saying that maybe you need to look into that

54:59.780 --> 55:01.420
to some degree and figure out what's going on

55:01.420 --> 55:02.260
with the person.

55:02.260 --> 55:03.660
And if somebody's got a snitch,

55:03.660 --> 55:05.300
again, people snitch about bestiality.

55:05.300 --> 55:08.620
People snitch about homosexuality now to others,

55:08.620 --> 55:10.700
but it's just not to the legal system.

55:10.700 --> 55:12.180
They snitch to their friends about it.

55:12.180 --> 55:14.380
They snitch to whoever, they tell other people,

55:14.380 --> 55:15.220
I don't know if you consider that,

55:15.220 --> 55:16.300
I don't know if that's really snitching,

55:16.300 --> 55:18.900
but they'll, you know, it's just not done

55:18.900 --> 55:19.740
to the government. Not in terms of what

55:19.740 --> 55:20.580
we're talking about, no, it's a different thing.

55:20.580 --> 55:21.520
That's a different thing.

55:21.520 --> 55:23.300
In this conversation, we're talking specifically

55:23.300 --> 55:27.020
about how does the government get the accurate information.

55:27.020 --> 55:28.360
No, no, what I'm talking about,

55:28.360 --> 55:29.580
and I'm talking about how does the government

55:29.580 --> 55:31.980
get the information necessary to implement its laws?

55:31.980 --> 55:33.440
That's what I'm talking about.

55:34.440 --> 55:37.000
Yeah, and it's the same way that it's done

55:37.000 --> 55:39.080
in every other country, dude.

55:39.080 --> 55:40.240
That's what my answer is.

55:40.240 --> 55:42.080
It's the same way it's done now,

55:42.080 --> 55:45.580
and I'm telling you it can be done even better, probably.

55:45.580 --> 55:47.200
I mean, I don't necessarily think,

55:47.200 --> 55:49.000
but I wouldn't necessarily,

55:49.000 --> 55:52.960
like there wouldn't be punishments for homosexuals,

55:52.960 --> 55:56.340
like you would believe, but I think, you know,

55:56.340 --> 55:58.920
probably snitching to some degree on homosexual behavior

55:58.920 --> 56:00.160
isn't necessarily a bad thing.

56:00.160 --> 56:01.360
Do you think that's bad?

56:01.360 --> 56:03.360
Depends what you mean.

56:03.360 --> 56:06.360
Do you think it's bad if the government knows you're gay?

56:08.720 --> 56:10.480
What if there is no punishment?

56:10.480 --> 56:13.600
If the government does nothing with the information, no.

56:13.600 --> 56:14.420
Okay.

56:14.420 --> 56:15.260
Because I don't think there's anything wrong

56:15.260 --> 56:16.100
with being gay.

56:16.100 --> 56:17.960
But hey, you know, at least what this means

56:17.960 --> 56:19.920
is that Nick Fuentes can have his catboys

56:19.920 --> 56:21.080
in your society, right?

56:22.140 --> 56:23.820
It's a bad, is it a bad thing

56:23.820 --> 56:26.480
if everybody in the society is gay?

56:26.480 --> 56:28.560
Is it a bad thing if homosexuality

56:28.560 --> 56:31.000
is on the rise in a society?

56:31.520 --> 56:32.360
Answer that question.

56:32.360 --> 56:33.720
Is it a bad, answer that question.

56:33.720 --> 56:36.000
Is it a bad thing if homosexuality-

56:36.000 --> 56:37.880
I think it can actually reach a point

56:37.880 --> 56:38.720
where it does become bad.

56:38.720 --> 56:40.080
There's too many people who are gay, yeah.

56:40.080 --> 56:42.220
Okay, so then you would even justify snitching

56:42.220 --> 56:43.360
to some degree.

56:43.360 --> 56:44.680
No, no, because here's the thing,

56:44.680 --> 56:45.520
I wouldn't make it legal.

56:45.520 --> 56:46.800
If there's too many people that are gay

56:46.800 --> 56:48.440
and you're not having enough kids,

56:48.440 --> 56:50.360
everybody's turning gay for some reason

56:50.360 --> 56:53.380
and there's nobody being, no kids being produced,

56:53.380 --> 56:54.220
then-

56:54.220 --> 56:55.280
Because there's chemicals in the water, yeah.

56:55.280 --> 56:58.200
It's, snitching is probably justified then to-

56:58.200 --> 57:00.360
Well, hold on, hold on, hold on, because here's the thing.

57:00.360 --> 57:03.400
Even in a society where being gay is on the rise,

57:03.400 --> 57:06.440
I wouldn't make it illegal to be gay.

57:06.440 --> 57:08.720
But what if you, what if it's on the rise

57:08.720 --> 57:11.400
so much that your people are suffering

57:11.400 --> 57:13.960
and living in hell because of it?

57:13.960 --> 57:15.800
How are they suffering and living in hell?

57:15.800 --> 57:19.160
Oh, sir, like you're not gonna answer the question?

57:19.160 --> 57:19.980
Okay, I got it.

57:19.980 --> 57:20.820
I need to know how they're suffering

57:20.820 --> 57:23.160
and handling in hell specifically.

57:23.160 --> 57:25.000
Oh, did he actually leave this time?

57:26.800 --> 57:27.820
Oh, shit.

57:27.820 --> 57:29.440
Earlier it was just because his microphone

57:29.440 --> 57:34.380
was getting cut off, but, well, that was fun.

57:37.840 --> 57:39.600
So you talk to this guy a lot?

57:39.600 --> 57:41.480
I've talked to him a couple of times.

57:41.480 --> 57:46.480
He, he's like this very strange combination

57:48.260 --> 57:50.680
of like, groiper and socialist

57:50.680 --> 57:55.680
that I've never quite encountered before in my entire life.

57:56.680 --> 58:01.680
Do you know who Big Papa Fascist Andrew Wilson is?

58:02.940 --> 58:04.860
Yes, I kinda do, yeah.

58:04.860 --> 58:08.440
Yeah, he got me to talk to him first,

58:08.440 --> 58:11.180
and then it's just been this ongoing saga

58:11.180 --> 58:15.500
of every once in a while he'll come through and talk.

58:15.500 --> 58:20.500
But yeah, this whole conversation started out with him

58:22.040 --> 58:25.260
complaining about getting a stalking charge

58:25.820 --> 58:29.340
that he had to plead guilty to, and now I know.

58:29.340 --> 58:31.300
He's stuck.

58:31.300 --> 58:33.380
Some girl he knew in real life, I guess,

58:33.380 --> 58:36.620
but like he denied the allegations, obviously.

58:36.620 --> 58:39.740
But yeah, it's been,

58:43.500 --> 58:45.920
this conversation's been going on

58:45.920 --> 58:48.660
for the longest time between me and him,

58:48.660 --> 58:51.000
where like, I'll say like, wow, you sound like a lefty.

58:51.000 --> 58:53.140
Well, maybe not a lefty now.

58:54.100 --> 58:58.300
He doesn't really have a full understanding

58:58.300 --> 58:59.740
of what his own positions are,

58:59.740 --> 59:02.180
except for like right now everything is bad

59:02.180 --> 59:04.220
and it needs to be fixed.

59:04.220 --> 59:06.900
And because it's all bad right now

59:06.900 --> 59:09.220
and it all needs to be fixed,

59:09.220 --> 59:14.220
we have to like fix it by tearing everything down,

59:14.620 --> 59:18.780
which sounds a lot like a lot of the like tankies

59:18.780 --> 59:21.780
I've talked to, where they know what their end goal is,

59:21.780 --> 59:24.300
which is some sort of like socialist fucking utopia,

59:24.300 --> 59:26.180
but like they don't have any plans

59:26.180 --> 59:27.280
on how to actually get there.

59:27.280 --> 59:29.700
What their plans are are to just like

59:29.700 --> 59:33.300
destroy the entire system and then we'll go from there.

59:33.300 --> 59:36.060
It's destroy first, fix everything later,

59:36.060 --> 59:38.700
instead of just trying to fix what we have,

59:38.700 --> 59:40.000
where we're at, you know?

59:40.980 --> 59:42.060
Yeah, yeah.

59:42.060 --> 59:45.340
He sounds, to use one of my own terms,

59:45.340 --> 59:47.180
he sounds very post-fascist

59:47.180 --> 59:48.900
in a lot of the things he's been saying.

59:48.900 --> 59:51.600
I'm actually like really blown away

59:52.360 --> 59:53.200
because I watched your video

59:53.200 --> 59:56.040
that you linked to me a while back about fascism,

59:56.040 --> 01:00:00.480
but you actually sound like you know

01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:02.880
what you're talking about compared to like 90%

01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:06.880
of everyone that I've ever talked to about fascism.

01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:08.120
That's just an illusion, to be honest.

01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:10.080
That's just an illusion.

01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:14.000
I mean, you were bringing up all the like scholars and shit,

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:15.880
so you know more than I do.

01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:19.160
Most of everything that I've learned about is all

01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:23.960
just watching other people's YouTube videos.

01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:27.840
And I guess I've read Giovanni Gentile.

01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:29.680
Well, I listened to the audio book.

01:00:29.680 --> 01:00:34.320
But yeah, I don't know.

01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:36.520
I don't even have any like thoughts afterwards.

01:00:36.520 --> 01:00:39.240
Like what do you think about that whole?

01:00:39.240 --> 01:00:40.960
Well, firstly, I just realized

01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:43.480
that I advertised going on your stream

01:00:43.480 --> 01:00:45.840
as talking to a post-fascist.

01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:47.240
So people probably think that you're one.

01:00:47.240 --> 01:00:50.800
Oh, yes, I am the fascist that he's talking about.

01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:53.280
All right, guys, fuck.

01:00:55.200 --> 01:00:59.800
The thing is, I could like recognize a lot of of more

01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:02.920
coherent points in what he was talking about,

01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:06.160
but he couldn't you couldn't get them out, you know, like.

01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:09.320
So there's an essay that Sargon wrote

01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:12.720
for his website, that for Lotus Eaters.

01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:15.800
And I think it was just, hold on, let me just I want to credit the right guy.

01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:17.560
He has like a dozen people working for him right now.

01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:24.000
I think it was Sargon.

01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:27.840
No, it wasn't Sargon.

01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:29.960
It was it was one of the people working for his site.

01:01:30.680 --> 01:01:33.040
You know, he doesn't he has like a news outlet now, right?

01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:35.240
Like that's his thing is doing the news. Oh, really?

01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:38.880
Yep. Lotus Eaters dot com is his news outlet.

01:01:39.560 --> 01:01:40.200
She does that now.

01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:41.640
I knew that there was a podcast.

01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:46.040
I've never like my my foray into politics

01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:49.800
online came basically after the fall of the like YouTube

01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:52.000
skeptics and Sargon and all of those people.

01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:55.560
So like, I never really watched any of his stuff from before.

01:01:56.760 --> 01:01:58.040
I was going to really fell.

01:01:58.040 --> 01:02:00.200
He like he he got kicked off Twitter.

01:02:00.200 --> 01:02:02.520
Everyone thinks that that's the same thing as dying, but it's not.

01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:08.440
And then his channel, he didn't upload there very much for a while, right?

01:02:08.760 --> 01:02:12.400
He got like he's actively blacklisted

01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:15.440
or sorry, shadow banned on the Sargon like official channel.

01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:19.920
So what he did was he got together some people that he knew

01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:22.080
and he started a news outlet.

01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:25.200
And now he does like a daily podcast over there.

01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:27.760
He's kind of abandoned the Sargon name.

01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:30.960
No, but someone on his site wrote an article

01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:34.000
called The Universal Acid of Liberalism.

01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:36.400
OK, and this this also applies to socialism, too.

01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:39.760
I think this person used liberalism just to mean the left,

01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:42.040
but it applies to liberalism and it applies to socialism.

01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:46.120
And the and this is where like the gray sludge is coming from,

01:02:46.600 --> 01:02:51.000
because there is an argument to be made that the the left

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.280
tends to universalize everything.

01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:56.400
The liberals do this and socialists do this and progressives do this.

01:02:56.600 --> 01:02:57.280
They all do this.

01:02:57.280 --> 01:03:01.280
The idea is like, well, the same framework can be used anywhere

01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:05.320
in any time and place with with any people, with any culture, with with anything.

01:03:05.320 --> 01:03:07.920
You know, you can have a functioning liberal society anywhere

01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:10.440
and cultural differences don't mean anything.

01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:13.040
And that leads to a universalization

01:03:13.440 --> 01:03:16.000
of a lot of the core tenants of society.

01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:21.120
Now, to visualize this, the right wing people will often appeal to architecture.

01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:24.920
Right. So British architecture looks different from German architecture,

01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:27.760
which looks different from Chinese architecture.

01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:32.320
And then you go to a modern city and it's all the same glass skyscraper.

01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:34.280
And they're like, look, look at what has been lost.

01:03:34.280 --> 01:03:37.120
Look at look at the diversity that has been lost when everything

01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:41.360
is universalized into into a more left wing way of living.

01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:47.120
And I think there's something to that critique that if if the entire world

01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:51.920
was actually a socialist utopia, you probably would lose a lot of diversity.

01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:55.360
I think like a lot of things that are particular to one location

01:03:55.360 --> 01:03:58.120
or to one language or to one people or to one cultural practice,

01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:01.640
you would have to lose all that thing because when things are equal,

01:04:01.640 --> 01:04:03.000
they are the same.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.080
And so you have to lose difference.

01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:08.680
But difference is what makes is what makes life fun, you know?

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
Yeah, no. So I think there's something to this point of view.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:16.320
And so when he talks about the the gray sludge, there is like

01:04:16.680 --> 01:04:20.160
I've heard people describe Marvel movies as gray sludge

01:04:20.800 --> 01:04:23.960
because they're kind of like a facsimile of a good movie.

01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:27.440
Yeah, they hit all the beats, but there's no reason for the beats to even happen.

01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:29.160
Like there's no artistry there.

01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:33.320
So it feels like a lot of of at least

01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:37.280
cultural leftism is just kind of like manufactured and fake.

01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:38.760
You know what I mean?

01:04:38.760 --> 01:04:41.720
Yeah, I I don't disagree with that. I feel like.

01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:49.080
Sorry, I don't have my ADD medicine, so I want to like try my best.

01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:52.320
So I haven't I've been I've been without Vyvanse for way too long.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:56.280
So I I feel like there's

01:04:56.840 --> 01:04:59.920
this like general feeling

01:04:59.920 --> 01:05:03.920
of lack of purpose that brings people to

01:05:05.280 --> 01:05:07.560
certain to these like more extreme positions.

01:05:07.560 --> 01:05:09.640
And this isn't a hot take. Everybody thinks this right.

01:05:09.880 --> 01:05:12.240
But yeah, I feel like the.

01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:16.960
The two paths you can go down, right,

01:05:17.720 --> 01:05:20.640
like either becoming like an ultra fucking socialist

01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:25.520
or an ultra fucking fascist is really depressing and it's extra depressing.

01:05:26.280 --> 01:05:30.680
When. The person doesn't even have that

01:05:31.120 --> 01:05:35.360
that full worldview because you can't even attack their worldview

01:05:35.360 --> 01:05:36.680
because it's nonexistent.

01:05:36.680 --> 01:05:38.760
That's what the deal is with this guy.

01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:44.480
I can't attack his like positions on like fascism or

01:05:45.160 --> 01:05:48.640
or socialism because he doesn't believe in either necessarily.

01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:52.080
He just believes, well, this is more fascist than socialist.

01:05:52.080 --> 01:05:55.360
He just believes in like by whatever means necessary. Right.

01:05:55.600 --> 01:05:59.560
So he could he's like a very strict consequentialist. Yeah.

01:05:59.600 --> 01:06:03.240
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And.

01:06:04.040 --> 01:06:06.360
Oh, fuck me. Sorry, playing Minesweeper two.

01:06:08.600 --> 01:06:12.040
So like, it's really hard having conversations with him about politics,

01:06:12.040 --> 01:06:14.960
even though like it's very fun and he gets like ultra like

01:06:14.960 --> 01:06:18.840
upsetty spaghetti about things, obviously, but it's like

01:06:19.880 --> 01:06:24.080
I don't even know where to begin because like I've done my own research into

01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:27.800
into fascism so that I can push back against fascists.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:32.320
I used to be a socialist, so I can push back against socialist shit a lot.

01:06:33.400 --> 01:06:35.440
But goddamn, when I can't

01:06:36.320 --> 01:06:41.040
pinpoint exactly like how to start attacking someone's

01:06:42.120 --> 01:06:46.040
like worldview, I don't know how we can like move forward in the conversation,

01:06:46.040 --> 01:06:48.160
because like again, he says like Grace Ludge, right?

01:06:48.160 --> 01:06:51.840
Like at first it was literal, like they're feeding us Grace Ludge. Right.

01:06:52.040 --> 01:06:54.640
And then it moves to McDonald's. Yeah.

01:06:54.680 --> 01:06:58.560
Yeah. And then it moves to like, no, I mean, metaphorical Grace Ludge.

01:06:58.720 --> 01:07:00.640
OK, well, let's talk about the metaphorical Grace Ludge.

01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:04.280
And there's no actual position there to attack

01:07:04.280 --> 01:07:06.960
because he just doesn't like what's going on now.

01:07:07.240 --> 01:07:10.400
What's going on now is the problem. Right. Yeah.

01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:14.280
Yeah. So I think part of it, well, actually, first of all, before we

01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:17.440
even write this down so I don't lose it, we get into that.

01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:21.360
Did you say that you disagreed with with the universalization take that I gave?

01:07:22.840 --> 01:07:25.320
No, I don't necessarily disagree with that.

01:07:25.320 --> 01:07:26.840
OK. All right.

01:07:26.840 --> 01:07:30.640
So the universalization in terms of like people being

01:07:32.320 --> 01:07:35.960
like the the Marvel movies, like it's like the Grace Ludge, like nothing is

01:07:36.560 --> 01:07:40.480
like we don't have like individual like areas that have their own unique culture,

01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:45.320
like like yeah, yeah, unique cuisines, dialects, et cetera.

01:07:45.320 --> 01:07:48.880
And the worst part about that is that that kind of leads to,

01:07:48.920 --> 01:07:50.720
you know, more ethno state thinking,

01:07:50.720 --> 01:07:52.720
which can obviously go down a different rabbit hole.

01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:56.400
But you also just can't have every everything and everyone

01:07:56.400 --> 01:07:59.600
and everywhere be the same and everything operates into the same system.

01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:01.440
Everyone thinks the same way.

01:08:01.440 --> 01:08:03.080
That's not going to work either. Right.

01:08:03.080 --> 01:08:05.240
There has to be some there has to be some difference

01:08:05.240 --> 01:08:08.800
between different places and different different people, you know.

01:08:10.200 --> 01:08:13.520
There's there's a there's a proper there's a proper balance

01:08:13.520 --> 01:08:18.000
to be struck here between like complete exclusion and exclusivity.

01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:21.400
And everyone kind of siloed off into their own bunkers

01:08:21.400 --> 01:08:22.840
where they don't interact with each other.

01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:27.200
And also everything being mixed together into one giant pot

01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:29.160
where nothing even stands out anymore.

01:08:29.160 --> 01:08:30.840
There's some there's some middle ground

01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:33.160
we can reach here between those two positions.

01:08:33.160 --> 01:08:38.120
Yeah, I feel like there's a lot of like like nerd culture things

01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:42.440
that I used to enjoy because there was like a certain level of exclusivity.

01:08:42.440 --> 01:08:44.320
Like there was like its own culture.

01:08:44.320 --> 01:08:46.760
Like I used to like when I was in high school,

01:08:46.760 --> 01:08:49.880
Warhammer 40K and D&D are like the two things that I've seen,

01:08:49.880 --> 01:08:51.400
like a massive shift in culture.

01:08:51.400 --> 01:08:55.680
And I feel like they've lost something because they've tried to universalize

01:08:55.680 --> 01:08:58.720
the experience so that everybody can enjoy it. Right.

01:08:59.480 --> 01:09:01.760
Yeah. So like Warhammer is for everyone.

01:09:01.960 --> 01:09:03.600
You've heard that a few times. Yeah.

01:09:03.600 --> 01:09:05.720
And I've argued. Well, no, it's not. It's actually not.

01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:09.000
Yeah, it really isn't like look at the fucking price point.

01:09:09.160 --> 01:09:16.080
But like the they're like one of the jokes in like D&D circles

01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:19.960
that you used to see were like the you know, someone would invite their girlfriend

01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:23.760
and she wanted to be like, you know, a fucking vampire and a werewolf

01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:26.320
and a fucking fairy and like

01:09:28.120 --> 01:09:30.920
it like technically it's possible. Right.

01:09:31.720 --> 01:09:35.000
And so like the people who like, I guess like what you're saying,

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.440
like the universalization of all these things, people would say,

01:09:37.560 --> 01:09:40.520
well, it's it's technically like possible to happen in the game.

01:09:40.520 --> 01:09:42.240
So there's nothing wrong with with that.

01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:45.120
But it's like, OK, but it's kind of taking away some parts of the game

01:09:45.120 --> 01:09:49.080
for like other people if like they can't if we have to like

01:09:49.320 --> 01:09:53.400
find like all these esoteric rules to make this like very hyper specific thing happen

01:09:53.560 --> 01:09:56.280
or in like Warhammer 40K like you like see people

01:09:57.160 --> 01:10:02.160
like they've kind of taken the edge of the like actual like fucked up shit

01:10:02.160 --> 01:10:05.240
that the entire setting is based off of. Right.

01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:10.200
You kind of like push that to the background,

01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:12.600
like they're not trying to like explicitly get rid of it,

01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:16.600
but like kind of implicitly because like the there's like the huge push

01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:18.840
for like female space Marines and all that stuff.

01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:21.240
And, you know, like they,

01:10:21.240 --> 01:10:26.920
you know, like all the Xeno like xenophobia, like literal xenophobia,

01:10:26.920 --> 01:10:31.120
fear of like aliens and anything outside of the Imperium, like where like

01:10:31.120 --> 01:10:34.520
it feels like they're trying to like pull back into like a.

01:10:36.640 --> 01:10:39.440
Technically, like more

01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:43.880
original Warhammer 40K aesthetic where they were like trading with aliens

01:10:43.880 --> 01:10:48.080
a little bit, but then they kind of moved into like the extra grim, dark shit.

01:10:49.560 --> 01:10:51.920
So like they're trying to like bring in like the like

01:10:51.920 --> 01:10:54.880
maybe not all of the mutants are bad and, you know.

01:10:55.080 --> 01:10:58.080
So I understand what you're talking about with that.

01:10:58.080 --> 01:11:00.280
That's my my spiel on that.

01:11:00.280 --> 01:11:02.440
80 D minded. Right. Right.

01:11:02.440 --> 01:11:03.640
No, I get it.

01:11:03.640 --> 01:11:07.560
There's like people there with Dark Souls, right? Mm hmm.

01:11:07.880 --> 01:11:09.720
We got to make Dark Souls more accessible.

01:11:09.720 --> 01:11:10.920
And it's like, well, actually, no, you don't,

01:11:10.920 --> 01:11:13.600
because the whole point of it is to be hard and inaccessible.

01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:17.360
And that's like if you if you make Dark Souls, but easy, what do you have?

01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:19.880
Right. Like a pretty generic game, you know, like

01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:24.680
inclusivity is not always a good thing.

01:11:25.080 --> 01:11:27.680
It can often be a good thing, but it's not always a good thing.

01:11:27.680 --> 01:11:30.960
And I think that's something that the left has to has to grapple with

01:11:30.960 --> 01:11:33.800
because they think it's it's always good all the time to get more people

01:11:33.800 --> 01:11:35.960
included and involved. And it's like, well, not necessarily.

01:11:36.240 --> 01:11:37.720
Sometimes you have to gatekeep.

01:11:37.720 --> 01:11:40.240
Sometimes gatekeeping is good, you know?

01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:41.840
Yeah, for sure.

01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:44.640
In terms of the gray sludge as food

01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:48.280
conversation, that's like the bugs.

01:11:48.480 --> 01:11:49.560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:11:49.560 --> 01:11:51.280
Well, to be fair, I've had bugs. I don't like them.

01:11:51.280 --> 01:11:53.720
I'm not going to ever actually eat the bugs.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:58.440
But like, there's this idea, especially in right wing spaces,

01:11:58.800 --> 01:12:01.000
that things have become too easy.

01:12:01.400 --> 01:12:03.920
You know, that that science and technological advancement

01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:05.280
have made things too easy.

01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:07.000
So he brought up fast food.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.040
And the problem with fast food

01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:12.200
is not just that you get fat and unhealthy while you eat it.

01:12:12.240 --> 01:12:14.320
That's a pretty big problem, but it's not the only problem.

01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:19.120
Another big problem with it is that it makes getting food too easy.

01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:21.160
You know, people are too divorced

01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:24.400
from the actual labor that creates the food and it makes them kind of feel

01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:27.920
there. You know, there's like this there's this view

01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:30.960
on the right of the liberal elite or the leftist elite, right?

01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:33.400
The people who are

01:12:33.400 --> 01:12:36.280
like kind of hypocritically very far left.

01:12:36.320 --> 01:12:40.440
Therefore, they're very in favor of these of these redistribution schemes

01:12:40.440 --> 01:12:42.040
or they want overt socialism.

01:12:42.040 --> 01:12:45.560
But at the same time, they're also the elite that would be destroyed

01:12:45.560 --> 01:12:47.040
by their own policies.

01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:49.600
And the right kind of views them as this way. Well.

01:12:50.560 --> 01:12:55.720
The right considers the reason that that that that that hypocrisy exists

01:12:55.720 --> 01:13:00.520
to the right is because they've become so divorced

01:13:00.520 --> 01:13:03.320
from the labor that actually keeps them around.

01:13:03.560 --> 01:13:07.040
So you have like a modern society, you have specialization of labor.

01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:10.960
So people, you know, I don't have to go out and grow my own food anymore.

01:13:11.040 --> 01:13:15.320
I can do a very niche job and get very, very good at one specific thing

01:13:15.320 --> 01:13:17.440
because somebody else's is growing more food.

01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:22.600
Have you seen that graph where it showed the percentage of a country's workforce

01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:25.000
in agriculture over time?

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.480
It's a very famous graph. Have you seen that?

01:13:27.480 --> 01:13:29.800
It describes what now?

01:13:29.800 --> 01:13:33.600
Killing percentage of people

01:13:33.600 --> 01:13:36.840
in agriculture over time, as they can find it.

01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:39.560
It's a very famous.

01:13:39.560 --> 01:13:41.840
Like stark graft, is it here?

01:13:44.120 --> 01:13:46.440
OK, here.

01:13:46.440 --> 01:13:49.280
This is from our world and data, and I'll post this.

01:13:49.920 --> 01:13:51.120
So check this out.

01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:55.240
What you see. Is as.

01:13:55.240 --> 01:13:59.920
Um. Basically, as countries modernize,

01:14:00.280 --> 01:14:03.680
the number of people working in agriculture drops drastically

01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:07.040
because you have fertilizer and you have you have farming equipment

01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:11.600
and you have you have all these you have you have basically the infrastructure

01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:15.400
to support less people growing way more food and also transporting it

01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:19.320
around a whole bunch of factors and refrigeration and all that shit. Yeah.

01:14:20.200 --> 01:14:24.200
Yeah. So basically what this means is you have you have an entire labor force

01:14:24.200 --> 01:14:25.760
that isn't growing food anymore.

01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:29.000
It's not involved in producing food in any way so they can specialize

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:32.240
so they can specialize in becoming whatever, you know.

01:14:32.440 --> 01:14:35.280
And as soon as we had more advanced machines, we have more specializations.

01:14:35.280 --> 01:14:38.280
That's why you have people being YouTubers now, the most useless job.

01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:42.560
And yet I can make a living off of it because the essentials

01:14:42.760 --> 01:14:46.920
in the workforce have been covered so efficiently that we can

01:14:47.320 --> 01:14:50.280
people can just do almost whatever they want compared to 500 years ago.

01:14:50.360 --> 01:14:53.240
You know, it's kind of it's insane how far we've come.

01:14:53.720 --> 01:14:56.040
However, what this leads to is

01:14:56.720 --> 01:15:00.880
a complete lack of knowledge or a lack of a lack of knowledge.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:04.160
So, for example, like, have you heard this is a very common story.

01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:09.000
You hear like the extremely intelligent university math professor

01:15:09.480 --> 01:15:11.800
who says you don't need to hunt.

01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:12.880
Why does anyone still hunt?

01:15:12.880 --> 01:15:14.880
Just go buy your meat from the grocery store.

01:15:14.880 --> 01:15:16.240
Why are we still killing animals?

01:15:16.240 --> 01:15:18.160
It doesn't make any sense. Just get it from the store.

01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:19.600
You hear that a lot, right? Yeah.

01:15:19.600 --> 01:15:23.040
And it's that actually people do actually say that it's because they're so

01:15:23.080 --> 01:15:25.320
specialized in one domain.

01:15:25.960 --> 01:15:28.200
They have no clue where their food comes from. Right.

01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:33.080
And so this kind of this being so divorced

01:15:33.080 --> 01:15:37.160
from what keeps the underpinnings of what keeps society running

01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:42.080
leads to the right wing thinks leads to a sort of liberal elite

01:15:42.080 --> 01:15:45.480
class of people who are very domesticated.

01:15:45.880 --> 01:15:49.880
They're very they're unable to really like do physical labor

01:15:49.880 --> 01:15:52.000
for themselves, keep themselves alive if they had to.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.600
And some in some sort of post-apocalyptic scenario.

01:15:54.960 --> 01:15:57.880
But they're very specialized in one like technical skill. Right.

01:15:57.960 --> 01:16:01.720
Yeah. And we've like that has always existed in some way, shape or form,

01:16:01.720 --> 01:16:03.760
as long as we've had like cities and stuff.

01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:05.640
But it's more and more pronounced.

01:16:05.640 --> 01:16:09.280
The more industrialized we get, the more people can specialize

01:16:09.480 --> 01:16:11.880
into like very, very hyper specific fields.

01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:15.240
And so like the perception is that like we've become

01:16:15.360 --> 01:16:19.040
a very weak society for sure. Yeah.

01:16:19.400 --> 01:16:22.960
And so there's like I think it was Kierkegaard.

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:24.600
Kierkegaard said something like,

01:16:24.600 --> 01:16:27.320
my job is to make everything worse for people,

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.200
which is a pretty extreme statement.

01:16:30.400 --> 01:16:36.640
His entire like outlook on life is just like the like everything sucks.

01:16:36.680 --> 01:16:39.320
My life sucks and I'm going to be very sad about it. Right.

01:16:40.080 --> 01:16:40.880
Kind of. Yeah.

01:16:40.880 --> 01:16:44.600
But but his point of view was that he believed we would reach a point

01:16:44.840 --> 01:16:47.320
in our scientific development

01:16:47.360 --> 01:16:49.600
that things would get too easy.

01:16:49.880 --> 01:16:54.240
And in fact, it would be we would have a better time if things were harder.

01:16:54.680 --> 01:17:00.040
And I think right wingers view that the modern era as being that tipping point.

01:17:00.240 --> 01:17:03.400
And that's why a lot of them talk about fast food, because you can get people.

01:17:04.360 --> 01:17:07.160
Who because people are, you know, they're dumb and they're weak

01:17:07.160 --> 01:17:10.440
and they have shitty morals and they're not able to do what's right all the time.

01:17:10.680 --> 01:17:13.120
So they're going to go get fast food whenever they're

01:17:13.280 --> 01:17:15.600
whenever their willpower, you know, wanes.

01:17:15.920 --> 01:17:18.080
They're going to take the path of least resistance

01:17:18.280 --> 01:17:22.640
and they're going to literally eat slop because it's cheap and it's plentiful.

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:26.920
And like what kind of person is capable of not doing that?

01:17:27.240 --> 01:17:30.240
Well, it does actually seem to be a reasonably special kind of person.

01:17:30.560 --> 01:17:34.200
So there is almost like a a natural hierarchy

01:17:34.560 --> 01:17:38.080
between people who have more willpower and people who have less willpower.

01:17:38.080 --> 01:17:42.080
And a lot of a lot of the current right wing paradigm relies on this point of view

01:17:42.080 --> 01:17:45.280
that society is has made things too easy.

01:17:45.520 --> 01:17:47.760
And it's created a bunch of soft people.

01:17:47.760 --> 01:17:50.320
And that kind of actually bears out in some of the data.

01:17:50.360 --> 01:17:53.000
Yeah, it's probably not as harsh as they think, but there's something to it.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.840
But I would also say that like a lot of people on the right, like they

01:17:56.520 --> 01:17:58.320
this is something I said earlier, right?

01:17:58.320 --> 01:18:03.240
Where they the right, especially like 2010 to 2019,

01:18:03.520 --> 01:18:06.520
like their whole thing was like, I'm not going to be made a victim.

01:18:06.680 --> 01:18:08.080
I'm not a victim of the system.

01:18:08.080 --> 01:18:11.120
I picked myself up by the bootstraps, you know, like their entire thing

01:18:11.120 --> 01:18:13.640
was like not being the fucking snowflake.

01:18:13.640 --> 01:18:17.280
And I got about like four or four posts

01:18:17.280 --> 01:18:20.280
into the Twitter files before he called me. But it.

01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:23.880
But like my perception of the Twitter files,

01:18:23.880 --> 01:18:26.520
and again, I haven't read very much of them at all.

01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:30.800
I read the full first one when it was being released one sentence

01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:33.160
at a fucking time and I didn't read any of the rest of them yet.

01:18:33.600 --> 01:18:38.680
But like their their whole thing was like, well, now like

01:18:39.360 --> 01:18:42.360
conservatives are seeing themselves like as the victim and like

01:18:42.680 --> 01:18:43.840
rallying behind that.

01:18:43.840 --> 01:18:47.960
I would say that like everybody everybody sees themselves as a victim,

01:18:48.760 --> 01:18:51.880
but they the the people that they're saying

01:18:51.880 --> 01:18:55.080
are like victimizing them are like very different.

01:18:55.280 --> 01:18:59.400
And so they see themselves as being better as the other victims.

01:18:59.880 --> 01:19:02.240
You know, does that make sense?

01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:04.720
Yeah. Yeah. A lot of people tend to

01:19:05.600 --> 01:19:07.320
this almost seems almost like a universal thing.

01:19:07.320 --> 01:19:08.960
I'm not sure if it is, but it seems very common.

01:19:08.960 --> 01:19:12.720
At least people tend to derive some sort of moral justification

01:19:12.720 --> 01:19:13.760
from being a victim.

01:19:13.760 --> 01:19:19.280
You know, if you if you go to like an like a very rigidly Islamic society,

01:19:19.280 --> 01:19:22.840
you know, like I'm not talking like like your average state in the Middle East.

01:19:22.840 --> 01:19:23.600
I mean, like ISIS.

01:19:23.600 --> 01:19:26.680
I go to go to go to an ISIS controlled area if they still controlled locations.

01:19:26.680 --> 01:19:28.920
Right. And you talk to them about what's going on.

01:19:29.120 --> 01:19:32.360
They would often appeal to the fact that the West has victimized them

01:19:32.360 --> 01:19:35.760
and therefore they are justified in, you know, implementing Sharia law.

01:19:35.960 --> 01:19:37.400
They'll they'll have other.

01:19:37.400 --> 01:19:41.960
They do that in China as well with the whole like opium wars and shit like that.

01:19:42.880 --> 01:19:44.400
You know, we have been victimized.

01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:48.480
Therefore, we can now, you know, push forward our ideas.

01:19:48.720 --> 01:19:50.600
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:19:50.600 --> 01:19:56.400
So I think there's because people I think I think this is actually

01:19:56.400 --> 01:20:00.400
this might even just be a a human thing, like a naturalistic thing,

01:20:00.400 --> 01:20:03.360
because people, you know, have have compassion.

01:20:03.720 --> 01:20:04.880
They have pity.

01:20:04.880 --> 01:20:09.280
I think there's definitely just a sense that if you can be a victim,

01:20:09.280 --> 01:20:12.240
that gets you political power and the left does it, the right does it.

01:20:12.400 --> 01:20:14.280
Everyone does it, you know?

01:20:14.280 --> 01:20:16.400
Yeah, no, I think that everybody does it.

01:20:16.600 --> 01:20:18.640
And that's something that like

01:20:18.640 --> 01:20:22.760
I was trying to explain to him that like before he jumped in, like when

01:20:22.920 --> 01:20:25.680
like I'm starting to get more into like real world politics,

01:20:25.680 --> 01:20:28.560
especially as I like get further into my degree, political science.

01:20:28.560 --> 01:20:31.120
Right. As I heard, I heard you talk about Georgia.

01:20:31.280 --> 01:20:32.320
Did you join?

01:20:32.320 --> 01:20:34.760
Did you go with destiny down to that?

01:20:34.760 --> 01:20:37.320
By the time I actually decided I was going to go, they said,

01:20:37.320 --> 01:20:39.880
like, please, no more people. We have too many people.

01:20:39.880 --> 01:20:44.560
So there was a splinter like DGG group that was helping in Augusta.

01:20:44.960 --> 01:20:47.120
And so I was there. So, yeah.

01:20:49.560 --> 01:20:53.400
I was trying to explain to him, like, if you if you like want to

01:20:53.400 --> 01:20:57.120
like do something like you can, there are things that you can do, right?

01:20:57.120 --> 01:21:02.200
Like stop like sitting here in like boo hooing about how like mean the world is.

01:21:02.440 --> 01:21:07.760
Right. How bad the the society that you live in is and actually like go and try

01:21:07.760 --> 01:21:11.600
and, you know, advocate for like your hyper specific,

01:21:11.840 --> 01:21:15.480
you know, like whatever policy that you think is like the most important to pass.

01:21:15.480 --> 01:21:19.200
Right. But more and more, especially as like

01:21:19.440 --> 01:21:22.800
people get like these grand narratives around politics

01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:26.440
and as they like see the world around them in like a very specific way,

01:21:26.480 --> 01:21:28.680
depending on who they're watching, like

01:21:28.680 --> 01:21:32.880
Vaush viewers are fucking like super far lefties, people who are watching infrared.

01:21:33.080 --> 01:21:35.720
They just feel like you have to tear down the whole fucking system.

01:21:35.960 --> 01:21:39.840
Well, maybe not Vaush viewers like Vaush is at least smart enough to say

01:21:39.840 --> 01:21:42.280
like we can like go incrementally.

01:21:42.560 --> 01:21:46.160
Although I don't know why I watched that.

01:21:46.200 --> 01:21:49.640
I watched that Vaush versus Rose Wriste from a few months ago,

01:21:49.640 --> 01:21:53.200
and he was like straight up like, nope, it's time for a revolution.

01:21:53.640 --> 01:21:57.440
Democracy has failed boys about like shooting conservatives out of the windows.

01:21:57.440 --> 01:21:59.200
But I don't know, like

01:21:59.400 --> 01:22:03.640
I haven't watched him since like, fuck, beginning of 2021.

01:22:04.200 --> 01:22:10.000
But like at least back then, he was more like incrementalist

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:13.080
and like violence when like.

01:22:14.040 --> 01:22:17.480
Absolutely necessary, or like when there's going to be some sort of,

01:22:18.080 --> 01:22:23.160
you know, takeover of the government from a socialist revolution or in self-defense.

01:22:23.200 --> 01:22:27.200
Now, he would make the argument that the trans genocide is going on right now

01:22:27.200 --> 01:22:30.000
is like self-defense to start like doming

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:33.280
all the fucking Republicans that are in your in your vicinity.

01:22:33.280 --> 01:22:37.400
But like stop being that fucking victim

01:22:37.400 --> 01:22:40.920
and stop crying and whining about how the entire system needs to be brought down.

01:22:41.080 --> 01:22:45.720
Look at what the situation actually is instead of like the grand narratives

01:22:45.720 --> 01:22:49.640
about like the fucking Jews owning the fucking like means of production

01:22:49.640 --> 01:22:52.880
and the fucking banking system and like pushing down white people

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.920
or stop looking at the world as if like there are like three people

01:22:55.920 --> 01:23:00.080
who are like a shadowy cabal, like meeting in their like pedophile sex

01:23:00.080 --> 01:23:03.560
dungeons to figure out what like a horrible piece of legislation

01:23:03.560 --> 01:23:07.720
they're going to do to ruin poor people's lives and like actually go out there

01:23:07.720 --> 01:23:12.280
and like do something and like advocate for some sort of like policy or some shit.

01:23:12.280 --> 01:23:15.200
Right. But they don't want to hear that.

01:23:15.200 --> 01:23:19.200
They don't want to hear like do something that is an actual solution to a problem.

01:23:19.360 --> 01:23:22.680
They want to tear down literally everything and.

01:23:23.680 --> 01:23:26.440
You know, like whatever happens afterwards,

01:23:26.440 --> 01:23:28.640
that's when we'll start dealing with it, you know?

01:23:29.440 --> 01:23:34.880
Yeah, a lot of them are taking the anti-democracy pill just because

01:23:34.880 --> 01:23:40.480
and I do mean this simply and only because their ideas aren't popular.

01:23:41.400 --> 01:23:45.240
Like if any of this shit on either side was actually popular,

01:23:45.240 --> 01:23:47.160
it would win elections and it doesn't.

01:23:47.160 --> 01:23:48.480
It's as simple as that.

01:23:48.480 --> 01:23:49.840
It's not a failure of democracy.

01:23:49.840 --> 01:23:51.560
It's not the system rigged against you.

01:23:51.600 --> 01:23:54.200
You know, it's no one is stuffing the ballot boxes.

01:23:54.520 --> 01:23:58.000
You know, it's not like it's not like judges are are somehow biased against you.

01:23:58.000 --> 01:23:59.800
It's that no one likes your ideas.

01:23:59.800 --> 01:24:01.760
Yeah, exactly. That's what I told him.

01:24:01.760 --> 01:24:04.920
Like nobody wants to live in this fucking fascist, fascist,

01:24:04.920 --> 01:24:07.800
theocratic fucking world where like

01:24:08.920 --> 01:24:11.440
you have no choices about like what you're able to do.

01:24:11.600 --> 01:24:14.080
Like look at all the things that liberalization has gotten us.

01:24:14.080 --> 01:24:17.560
Like we have like cheaper consumer goods, cheaper electronics.

01:24:17.560 --> 01:24:20.520
You can buy cars a lot cheaper, although maybe not in the past two years

01:24:20.520 --> 01:24:22.320
because of supply chain shit.

01:24:22.320 --> 01:24:23.960
Right. Like cars are cheaper.

01:24:23.960 --> 01:24:25.000
Housing is not cheaper.

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:26.360
That is a failure of democracy.

01:24:26.360 --> 01:24:28.600
And I was I was like, holy shit.

01:24:28.720 --> 01:24:32.320
Yeah, it Dev knows way more about this shit than me

01:24:32.320 --> 01:24:36.320
because I probably wouldn't have like thought to like bring up the

01:24:36.840 --> 01:24:41.240
the failures of democracy to like explain how our system is still working

01:24:41.440 --> 01:24:43.320
as intended. Right.

01:24:43.320 --> 01:24:46.440
But like the the whole like.

01:24:47.320 --> 01:24:50.640
The whole thing that like they.

01:24:52.040 --> 01:24:55.600
They ignore all of the good that liberalization has gotten us. Right.

01:24:55.760 --> 01:24:59.320
And they just want to like, yeah, imagine what like a utopia

01:24:59.320 --> 01:25:05.000
would be under their hyper specific, you know, niche political ideal is.

01:25:05.280 --> 01:25:07.960
Right. And it's really fucking blackpilling to me because.

01:25:10.120 --> 01:25:11.840
I feel like.

01:25:12.360 --> 01:25:14.880
I I tried to.

01:25:14.920 --> 01:25:18.320
If I'm being like completely honest, I think I tried to force myself

01:25:18.320 --> 01:25:23.000
to be a socialist when I've always been a like hyper liberal. Right.

01:25:23.200 --> 01:25:25.760
Like, I've always believed that people should have like the right to own guns.

01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:27.760
I've always believed that people should have the right to like

01:25:27.760 --> 01:25:29.640
open up a business if they fucking want to.

01:25:29.640 --> 01:25:32.880
Well, you know, I but like the.

01:25:34.640 --> 01:25:38.240
Nicer talking points of socialism, where like everyone has the

01:25:38.360 --> 01:25:43.360
the means to like live a good and happy life, you know, the you know,

01:25:43.360 --> 01:25:48.480
like maybe we could like take care of utilities for people and like nationalize

01:25:48.480 --> 01:25:52.920
those like the like soft socialism things are the things that kind of won me over.

01:25:52.920 --> 01:25:55.320
And then, you know, as I learned about actual economics,

01:25:55.320 --> 01:25:59.760
then I moved back over to where I was in high school. Yeah. Yeah. Like.

01:26:02.400 --> 01:26:04.080
I kind of lost where I was going with that,

01:26:04.080 --> 01:26:09.680
but like the overarching thing is like the the the liberalization of the world,

01:26:09.680 --> 01:26:13.000
especially in the West, has gotten so much good shit.

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:17.960
It's just like I wouldn't have been able to afford the fucking computer that I have

01:26:17.960 --> 01:26:23.360
right now if it wasn't for like, you know, globalized fucking trade,

01:26:23.360 --> 01:26:27.600
being able to, you know, like Taiwan making the fucking computer chips

01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:32.760
and they're mining the lithium and fucking what, Bolivia or whatever the fuck.

01:26:32.960 --> 01:26:37.360
Like if that wasn't happening, then this computer would cost like four hundred

01:26:37.360 --> 01:26:41.240
thousand dollars, right, because they would have to like source

01:26:41.240 --> 01:26:43.920
like the three percent of the world's

01:26:43.920 --> 01:26:48.880
lithium out of like four countries that still do trade with us. So, yeah.

01:26:50.640 --> 01:26:51.520
No, I know what you mean.

01:26:51.520 --> 01:26:56.240
I mean, Lord Tennyson's pipe in the chat, he says just because goods are cheaper

01:26:56.240 --> 01:26:58.880
doesn't mean that we are living better, more meaningful lives.

01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:02.080
A meaningless life is an unfree one because we're trapped with our desires.

01:27:02.360 --> 01:27:03.440
There's some truth to that, right?

01:27:03.440 --> 01:27:07.120
Like liberalism has unleashed this incredible productive power

01:27:07.680 --> 01:27:10.160
and socialism would just destroy it.

01:27:11.240 --> 01:27:14.960
But the issues that we're facing now, they aren't productive in nature.

01:27:15.320 --> 01:27:17.880
And, you know, more capitalism won't won't fix it.

01:27:18.040 --> 01:27:20.360
Socialism won't fix it either. Socialism will make it worse.

01:27:20.640 --> 01:27:22.680
We're facing a different problem now.

01:27:22.680 --> 01:27:26.360
But it's a problem that I don't think people on the left have any solution for.

01:27:27.360 --> 01:27:29.720
Because now we're talking about metaphysics, right?

01:27:29.720 --> 01:27:31.120
We're talking about meaning.

01:27:31.120 --> 01:27:35.360
And this is a materialist analysis can't get you to the solution of this problem.

01:27:35.680 --> 01:27:39.440
Right. If you're just focusing on, well, oh, number goes up, paycheck goes up.

01:27:39.440 --> 01:27:42.840
More stuff. Everyone has has has better quality of living.

01:27:42.840 --> 01:27:44.920
Well, it's like, OK, that's good.

01:27:44.920 --> 01:27:48.120
It's not nothing, but it doesn't bring meaning.

01:27:48.160 --> 01:27:49.320
Yeah, it doesn't get you.

01:27:49.320 --> 01:27:52.320
It doesn't get you like the happiness of like hanging out with your friends

01:27:52.320 --> 01:27:55.320
and having like those experiences with them or like meeting someone

01:27:55.320 --> 01:27:56.480
and like settling down

01:27:56.480 --> 01:27:58.720
and having like a life with them if that's what you choose. Right.

01:27:58.880 --> 01:28:00.600
It doesn't get you that sort of thing.

01:28:00.600 --> 01:28:03.760
But it certainly makes a lot of those things like easier

01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:05.800
if you're able to afford to go out with your friends.

01:28:05.800 --> 01:28:09.160
But I think that like the biggest thing

01:28:09.160 --> 01:28:13.640
that is like lost us meaning is like how interconnected we are like.

01:28:13.760 --> 01:28:16.240
And that's ironic coming from someone that likes to stream

01:28:16.240 --> 01:28:19.480
and like post YouTube videos and argue with people about politics. Right.

01:28:19.480 --> 01:28:22.320
And I'm talking to people from Australia and fucking.

01:28:22.480 --> 01:28:26.720
I'm talking to you over fucking discord on in Canada and fucking like, you know,

01:28:26.720 --> 01:28:30.880
like the hyper interconnectivity of everyone kind of

01:28:31.600 --> 01:28:35.040
expands our social circles to such a degree

01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:38.000
that we don't have like the like more personal

01:28:39.320 --> 01:28:41.200
relationships in our everyday lives.

01:28:41.200 --> 01:28:43.880
I think that so many people are lacking right now.

01:28:44.080 --> 01:28:47.800
And I've like with that guy, I've talked to him like multiple times about this.

01:28:47.920 --> 01:28:51.920
Like, hey, like, do you have friends in real life that you talk to

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:55.480
that like aren't online, like telling you that you need to like

01:28:55.640 --> 01:28:57.640
kill all the Jews or some shit? Right.

01:28:57.640 --> 01:29:00.280
Do you have people in your everyday life that would be like

01:29:00.920 --> 01:29:04.080
sad if you like went and shot up a school like because like

01:29:04.440 --> 01:29:07.720
it he's kind of like alluded to shit like that before.

01:29:08.640 --> 01:29:11.200
Like it's like this.

01:29:11.200 --> 01:29:13.760
Like, do you have these kinds of like

01:29:13.760 --> 01:29:17.080
real life connections that you can actually feel happy with?

01:29:17.080 --> 01:29:19.920
And I, I never got a straight answer for him.

01:29:20.040 --> 01:29:22.880
But I know like I look at online and all the like,

01:29:23.680 --> 01:29:27.280
like extreme like lefty, like trans people

01:29:27.280 --> 01:29:30.200
that I have argued with, like and lost my twitch because of.

01:29:30.400 --> 01:29:33.360
And it's like these people don't talk to people in real fucking life.

01:29:33.360 --> 01:29:35.320
All of their friends are on fucking Discord.

01:29:35.320 --> 01:29:37.640
And like, it's good to have friends on Discord.

01:29:37.640 --> 01:29:39.760
I like talking to people on Discord. It's very fun.

01:29:39.760 --> 01:29:43.760
But like I go out and I fucking, you know, like I go to my my friend's house.

01:29:43.760 --> 01:29:45.160
I went to his house last night.

01:29:45.160 --> 01:29:48.360
We fucking played music and we played fucking video games

01:29:48.360 --> 01:29:49.680
like right there next to each other.

01:29:49.680 --> 01:29:52.240
We didn't do it over the over fucking Discord.

01:29:52.240 --> 01:29:54.240
So we actually have that human to human connection.

01:29:54.240 --> 01:29:57.640
You know, I go out with my friends and I like we go bar hopping occasionally.

01:29:57.880 --> 01:30:00.440
Like we invite people over to our house to,

01:30:00.440 --> 01:30:02.920
you know, to socialize and actually, you know.

01:30:04.320 --> 01:30:07.960
Have these like human experiences that people

01:30:08.800 --> 01:30:11.000
I think took for granted,

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:15.320
and they think that it can be like one to one replicated online.

01:30:15.560 --> 01:30:18.160
Right. Look at all the people who are doing long distance

01:30:18.160 --> 01:30:20.920
dating and having like e-boyfriends and e-girlfriends.

01:30:21.200 --> 01:30:26.320
Like it's it's not the same as having someone like that's there every day

01:30:26.320 --> 01:30:29.760
with you and like like having the physical touch and shit like that, you know.

01:30:31.200 --> 01:30:32.280
Yeah, yeah.

01:30:32.280 --> 01:30:37.480
I you know, I'm an I'm an atheist, but at the same time, I do think that

01:30:38.040 --> 01:30:41.840
now that I'm a little bit older than, you know, my my edgy 16 year old phase.

01:30:41.880 --> 01:30:45.520
Yeah, I do think that something was probably lost

01:30:45.520 --> 01:30:49.120
when church became not so popular anymore,

01:30:49.680 --> 01:30:52.320
because even like, OK, you don't believe in God, you believe in God.

01:30:52.320 --> 01:30:55.040
But like it was definitely a community that was there.

01:30:55.040 --> 01:30:57.760
You know, you could go to a church, see everyone in the community

01:30:57.760 --> 01:30:59.160
once a week, touch base.

01:30:59.160 --> 01:31:00.200
You don't got to hang out with them every day,

01:31:00.200 --> 01:31:02.480
but like maybe maybe there's a guy you don't normally see all that off.

01:31:02.680 --> 01:31:04.000
You see him at church once a week.

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:08.240
You can connect with your community, get a little bit of moral instruction

01:31:08.360 --> 01:31:11.880
from from the priest, you know, spend your Sunday morning like.

01:31:12.440 --> 01:31:14.920
I've heard this take before and I grew up.

01:31:14.920 --> 01:31:20.320
My dad was a pastor for most of my life, and I out of everyone in my family,

01:31:20.320 --> 01:31:23.040
I've had like the least engagement with with church stuff.

01:31:23.200 --> 01:31:25.440
But I see like my older and my younger brother.

01:31:25.480 --> 01:31:28.440
They both have, you know, friends that they made in church

01:31:28.440 --> 01:31:32.040
and they had, you know, like lasting friendships with people

01:31:32.040 --> 01:31:35.600
that they met at like summer camp at the like church events and shit. Right.

01:31:35.800 --> 01:31:38.760
Like my my dad is like organize all these youth groups

01:31:38.760 --> 01:31:42.440
and like the the people from those youth groups still message them on Facebook.

01:31:42.440 --> 01:31:45.760
And, you know, whenever they come into Texas and they

01:31:46.400 --> 01:31:47.360
they'll come and visit them.

01:31:47.360 --> 01:31:50.240
And like there are long lasting,

01:31:50.240 --> 01:31:53.400
you know, connections that you can make with real life fucking people.

01:31:53.640 --> 01:31:55.080
Right. Yeah. Through church.

01:31:55.080 --> 01:31:56.520
And like I had never got that.

01:31:56.520 --> 01:31:59.000
So like a lot of my friends came from online.

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:02.240
Right. But, you know.

01:32:02.240 --> 01:32:03.880
Well, the thing is, it doesn't have to be church, right?

01:32:03.880 --> 01:32:06.760
You have it like a community center, if you're like some sort like

01:32:07.320 --> 01:32:09.760
there's like Italian centers, Ukrainian centers, you know,

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.600
there's there's these places for like immigrant groups.

01:32:12.840 --> 01:32:14.920
There's you can get it in the military.

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:16.800
You can join boy scouts if you're a kid.

01:32:16.800 --> 01:32:20.360
Like there's all of these institutions that exist in our society

01:32:20.840 --> 01:32:25.480
that seem to be crumbling with with atomization.

01:32:25.960 --> 01:32:29.000
And a materialist analysis will not help that.

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.240
And I don't think the left has a solution for this.

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.200
But but the right the right talks about community.

01:32:34.240 --> 01:32:35.760
It talks about community building.

01:32:35.760 --> 01:32:38.880
You know, it talks about all the stuff, you know,

01:32:38.880 --> 01:32:41.880
the right's very community focused, is very local focused.

01:32:42.320 --> 01:32:45.400
And I think they probably have solutions to the crisis

01:32:45.400 --> 01:32:47.320
of meaning that are better than leftist solutions.

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:52.320
Yeah, I don't know how we like get people to

01:32:53.320 --> 01:32:59.560
form those IRL connections, because like I know that there's like

01:32:59.560 --> 01:33:02.520
two community centers that are walking distance from me. Right.

01:33:02.880 --> 01:33:07.600
And I there's I don't ever see anybody there

01:33:07.600 --> 01:33:10.960
unless it's like, you know, Election Day. Right.

01:33:11.880 --> 01:33:16.600
So I don't know how we can like actually like pull people to go there

01:33:17.240 --> 01:33:19.360
and like get those kinds of messages out.

01:33:19.360 --> 01:33:23.400
Like, I know that they have little like luncheons and shit

01:33:23.400 --> 01:33:25.120
and events and stuff like that.

01:33:25.120 --> 01:33:29.240
But I don't I don't think I know a single fucking person has ever gone to

01:33:31.200 --> 01:33:33.560
to like a community center for

01:33:35.160 --> 01:33:36.440
anything other than voting.

01:33:37.960 --> 01:33:39.080
So, yeah, I know what you mean.

01:33:39.080 --> 01:33:40.720
Same. I think it's like an old person thing.

01:33:40.720 --> 01:33:43.680
And, you know, in twenty five years when they're all dead,

01:33:43.680 --> 01:33:46.560
it'll probably be something that's like sorely missing from society.

01:33:47.560 --> 01:33:53.320
Yeah, I feel like a lot of the people that I want to like talk to,

01:33:54.200 --> 01:33:57.320
especially because it's like all of the fucking content that's online right now.

01:33:57.480 --> 01:34:03.360
But the red pill shit that's trying to give young men some meaning in life.

01:34:04.360 --> 01:34:07.480
I'd love to talk to either like a supporter of like the like,

01:34:07.600 --> 01:34:10.760
you know, Andrew Tate or fucking fresh and fit or like one of the

01:34:11.040 --> 01:34:14.600
because there's no way I'm going to get into a conversation with any of like

01:34:14.600 --> 01:34:17.720
the medium or larger size YouTubers unless I

01:34:18.960 --> 01:34:21.400
just go like apeshit on them on Twitter and

01:34:22.840 --> 01:34:24.560
somehow like pull a conversation.

01:34:24.560 --> 01:34:28.040
But like, it'd be so interesting to like talk to them about that sort of thing.

01:34:30.600 --> 01:34:34.640
Well, to be fair, Andrew Tate and Andrew Tate and fresh and fit,

01:34:34.640 --> 01:34:37.160
there's a pretty big gap between those two.

01:34:37.160 --> 01:34:37.840
I know what you mean.

01:34:37.840 --> 01:34:39.600
But like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:34:40.560 --> 01:34:43.600
Secondly, I saw not so erudite on fresh and fit,

01:34:43.640 --> 01:34:46.200
and she did a pretty good job going back and forth with one of them.

01:34:47.080 --> 01:34:49.640
So I think I know I think I know the kind of

01:34:49.640 --> 01:34:51.600
I think I know the kind of conversation that you're looking for.

01:34:51.600 --> 01:34:54.080
And I think she did a good job at that because she brought up

01:34:54.080 --> 01:34:57.080
like traditional values and it kind of, you know, OK,

01:34:57.920 --> 01:34:59.960
here's here's what I'll say about fresh and fit.

01:34:59.960 --> 01:35:01.080
All right. They always say,

01:35:01.080 --> 01:35:04.800
man, we are representative of what women actually think,

01:35:04.800 --> 01:35:07.640
because we got all these women here, they're from different countries,

01:35:07.640 --> 01:35:10.320
different classes, different education levels, different races,

01:35:10.680 --> 01:35:11.920
all these different types of women.

01:35:11.920 --> 01:35:13.200
So we get everyone's opinion.

01:35:13.200 --> 01:35:14.840
And it's like, well, hold on.

01:35:14.840 --> 01:35:17.560
You don't get opinions from women who wouldn't go on fresh and fit.

01:35:18.280 --> 01:35:20.080
Yeah, it's a pretty big demographic.

01:35:20.080 --> 01:35:23.800
People who wouldn't subject themselves to being on that fucking show,

01:35:23.800 --> 01:35:27.720
you know, because Jesus Christ, like, mocked by like five like ultra

01:35:27.720 --> 01:35:30.080
red pillars telling them that they're like roasties

01:35:30.080 --> 01:35:32.560
who like slept with too many fucking men and shit.

01:35:32.760 --> 01:35:35.040
You know, like, I, I wouldn't want to be a woman

01:35:35.040 --> 01:35:37.440
and go on that fucking podcast for goddamn sure.

01:35:37.880 --> 01:35:42.840
But but when when not so erudite walked into walked into the Wolf's Den,

01:35:42.840 --> 01:35:45.760
you know, she did pretty well for herself because she she had the data.

01:35:45.760 --> 01:35:47.720
She had she had her own experiences,

01:35:47.720 --> 01:35:49.560
which are very different from everyone else's there.

01:35:49.560 --> 01:35:51.400
She she's not a Miami girl, you know? Yeah.

01:35:51.400 --> 01:35:54.200
So I think that was actually a very interesting conversation.

01:35:54.720 --> 01:35:58.560
I actually all have to watch that thing because I

01:35:59.480 --> 01:36:03.240
when they were first starting to go on to the fresh

01:36:03.240 --> 01:36:05.280
and fit panels like Destiny and erudite and,

01:36:06.960 --> 01:36:09.440
you know, all these things, Nico was there, too. Yes, Nico.

01:36:09.680 --> 01:36:11.680
I cannot stand, Nico.

01:36:11.680 --> 01:36:17.440
But my secret seems like a young lost guy who will come around eventually.

01:36:17.560 --> 01:36:22.440
I hope so. I the only interaction I've ever had with him was bullying him

01:36:22.440 --> 01:36:25.600
off of a panel on Destiny's stream, like one of those impromptu things

01:36:25.600 --> 01:36:27.840
after a Mr. Girl conversation. But

01:36:30.240 --> 01:36:32.920
yeah, like I was so like.

01:36:32.920 --> 01:36:37.160
Uninterested in those conversations at the at the beginning,

01:36:37.160 --> 01:36:40.880
but now it's like it's all fucking encompassing, right?

01:36:40.960 --> 01:36:43.320
Like I can't escape it. It's everywhere.

01:36:43.680 --> 01:36:48.800
And so now like now I'm interested because one of the one of the reasons

01:36:48.800 --> 01:36:53.440
I started getting into like streaming on on Twitch and doing politics and stuff is

01:36:54.040 --> 01:36:58.840
I knew a couple of people that were like relatively like normal dudes

01:36:58.840 --> 01:37:00.320
in high school, right?

01:37:00.320 --> 01:37:04.360
Like pretty chill dudes, nice guys, upstanding citizens.

01:37:04.560 --> 01:37:08.840
And they like became like ultra far alt righty like neo Nazi.

01:37:08.840 --> 01:37:12.280
I think one of them might have been at Charlottesville

01:37:12.280 --> 01:37:13.800
or maybe he had friends at Charlottesville,

01:37:13.800 --> 01:37:17.200
and maybe that's why he posted about it so much on Facebook. But he is.

01:37:17.240 --> 01:37:21.480
Yeah, like they like went super, super, super far right afterwards.

01:37:21.480 --> 01:37:26.280
And the the reason for that, as far as I can tell, based off of their posts

01:37:26.280 --> 01:37:29.400
and the arguments I would get into with them, like in 20,

01:37:29.560 --> 01:37:32.560
you know, 2017, 2018, 2019

01:37:33.560 --> 01:37:37.080
before they blocked me was like they

01:37:37.400 --> 01:37:40.840
they just had like nothing going for them, like despite everything

01:37:40.840 --> 01:37:45.200
like being great for them and in high school and like all the life prospects

01:37:45.200 --> 01:37:48.320
that they had, like going into

01:37:48.320 --> 01:37:53.400
into adulthood, like all of that kind of just washed away.

01:37:53.400 --> 01:37:56.240
Part of that is because they were like throwing their lot in with Nazis

01:37:56.240 --> 01:37:58.320
and people knew who the fuck they were. But like,

01:37:59.560 --> 01:38:03.640
like the the the lost young man

01:38:03.640 --> 01:38:09.640
kind of, you know, stereotype is one of the reasons why I got into streaming.

01:38:09.920 --> 01:38:14.040
And it's

01:38:15.640 --> 01:38:19.840
I feel like a lot of people for I feel like part partly

01:38:19.840 --> 01:38:23.600
because of like the coronavirus stuff in 2020 and then

01:38:23.800 --> 01:38:26.480
21 came around and people kind of forgot about like,

01:38:26.800 --> 01:38:32.320
you know, men's issues are like really, you know, fucked up right now. Right.

01:38:33.040 --> 01:38:36.440
Now that it's coming back around now,

01:38:36.440 --> 01:38:38.680
it it's piqued my interest.

01:38:38.680 --> 01:38:42.400
And I I don't know, I

01:38:42.400 --> 01:38:44.600
I feel like I want to have those conversations,

01:38:44.600 --> 01:38:47.640
but they're like very difficult to

01:38:48.680 --> 01:38:52.360
to find with the audience that I've kind of gathered

01:38:52.360 --> 01:38:58.520
and then lost and then rebuilt after the switch from socialism to liberalism

01:38:58.520 --> 01:39:04.040
and based trans advocate to genocide denier and all that shit. So.

01:39:06.240 --> 01:39:10.160
Man, the trans genocide conversation is so fucking ridiculous.

01:39:10.160 --> 01:39:12.680
I hate that one. It's insane.

01:39:13.640 --> 01:39:16.800
But in terms of man, I do know what you mean.

01:39:17.320 --> 01:39:21.880
Like it's not the left that caused all of these problems for men,

01:39:21.880 --> 01:39:23.560
though they definitely caused some of them for sure.

01:39:23.560 --> 01:39:26.400
However, the the main denial

01:39:26.600 --> 01:39:29.920
that the problem even exists is 100 percent from the left.

01:39:30.320 --> 01:39:34.080
And so I think there's an entire generation of young men

01:39:34.080 --> 01:39:36.200
who are just never going to be left us because of that alone.

01:39:36.440 --> 01:39:39.320
You know, when they were at their lowest point,

01:39:39.520 --> 01:39:42.960
they were told by this group that all of their issues didn't exist.

01:39:42.960 --> 01:39:46.640
And they're all just misogynists for having the issue in the first place.

01:39:46.640 --> 01:39:49.960
And it's like, well, that you're not getting them back.

01:39:49.960 --> 01:39:51.440
They're gone, you know?

01:39:51.440 --> 01:39:55.040
Yeah. And I feel like

01:39:55.040 --> 01:39:58.120
with me growing up, I never really

01:39:58.120 --> 01:40:01.000
because I just like wasn't on the Internet until like twenty

01:40:01.920 --> 01:40:03.960
twenty seventeen, twenty eighteen.

01:40:03.960 --> 01:40:08.000
I didn't see any of like the like feminists,

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:11.240
like, you know, attacking men all the time. So I never

01:40:12.600 --> 01:40:15.200
so I was like one of those liberals who was like, yeah,

01:40:15.200 --> 01:40:18.320
what fucking problems do you have? Like, well,

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:22.280
I didn't understand that until I started,

01:40:22.520 --> 01:40:25.320
probably until like I started streaming or watching people

01:40:25.320 --> 01:40:27.480
that like got me into streaming. Right.

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.480
Because the the environment

01:40:31.480 --> 01:40:34.440
that I grew up in was just like very chill.

01:40:34.600 --> 01:40:39.280
I never like my my family have always been very, very liberal,

01:40:39.280 --> 01:40:42.960
very, very, you know, pro LGBT

01:40:42.960 --> 01:40:46.640
and like anti anti racist and all this shit, you know,

01:40:47.320 --> 01:40:50.600
very not conservative in almost any way, shape or form.

01:40:51.840 --> 01:40:55.480
So I grew up in that bubble and then like getting exposed to like.

01:40:56.640 --> 01:41:02.080
The online sphere initially was like of a massive shock

01:41:02.080 --> 01:41:05.120
because there are all these conversations that were being had online.

01:41:05.120 --> 01:41:07.880
I was like, these are not real issues. Right.

01:41:08.760 --> 01:41:12.520
And to a certain degree, I still think that like most of the things

01:41:12.520 --> 01:41:15.240
that people talk about online are not real issues.

01:41:15.480 --> 01:41:19.840
But there are some that either aren't an issue,

01:41:19.840 --> 01:41:22.560
but there's a grain of truth in there or there's

01:41:23.680 --> 01:41:27.240
there is an issue that's been like blown up by it,

01:41:27.240 --> 01:41:30.960
like the like virulent fucking arguments

01:41:30.960 --> 01:41:34.200
that happen on Twitter and on fucking the streams and shit

01:41:34.400 --> 01:41:36.520
that people think that they're much more of an issue that they are.

01:41:37.640 --> 01:41:40.680
So like, I think that there are there are issues

01:41:40.680 --> 01:41:43.520
with men right now that need to be addressed.

01:41:43.520 --> 01:41:46.000
Like they don't have very much meaning.

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:50.160
You know, women are outpacing them in like academic endeavors.

01:41:51.360 --> 01:41:54.320
They're being out earned by women more and more and more.

01:41:54.840 --> 01:41:58.800
And so like there's like that aspect of like trying to find a partner

01:41:58.800 --> 01:42:01.240
that wants to be with you if they're earning,

01:42:02.040 --> 01:42:05.480
you know, if they're earning more than you than like, are you like actually a man

01:42:05.480 --> 01:42:09.200
or will they even date you if you if they have a bigger paycheck than you?

01:42:09.200 --> 01:42:12.920
Because people generally want to like date up or date at their level,

01:42:12.920 --> 01:42:14.520
not date down.

01:42:15.480 --> 01:42:18.120
But yeah, it's just like

01:42:18.760 --> 01:42:22.080
it was a very strange culture shock coming into the Internet

01:42:22.080 --> 01:42:24.080
and seeing these conversations, especially like

01:42:25.520 --> 01:42:29.520
revisiting older like destiny content or revisiting

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:33.520
like I've gone back and I've watched some of the old like skeptic videos

01:42:33.920 --> 01:42:37.920
out of curiosity five years after the death of that, you know,

01:42:38.920 --> 01:42:42.120
huge bubble online with all the Ransonas and stuff.

01:42:43.400 --> 01:42:45.400
And it it.

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000
It's just a very

01:42:49.560 --> 01:42:52.160
strange thing to see, like how like I grew up

01:42:52.800 --> 01:42:56.440
in in this area, never seeing these issues, then seeing everybody

01:42:56.440 --> 01:42:58.560
talk about these issues like they were the biggest things in the world.

01:42:58.720 --> 01:43:02.160
And then like now we're at this place where we're revisiting some of those issues.

01:43:02.880 --> 01:43:08.720
And some of the like conversations about it have become this like ultra fucking

01:43:08.760 --> 01:43:13.760
like weird MGTOW, like just fuck as many women as you as you can growing up.

01:43:13.760 --> 01:43:17.840
And then, you know, like once you're ready to settle down, like find yourself

01:43:17.840 --> 01:43:21.560
like a 19 year old woman who's never fucking had a relationship

01:43:21.560 --> 01:43:24.200
in her entire life and marry her because she's pure.

01:43:24.200 --> 01:43:27.920
And then on the on one side of the aisle

01:43:28.080 --> 01:43:31.680
and then the other side of the aisle saying like men have no issues whatsoever.

01:43:31.680 --> 01:43:34.400
And women are like the like most oppressed group on Earth.

01:43:34.400 --> 01:43:38.240
And it's just very strange to see how the conversation has evolved.

01:43:38.240 --> 01:43:39.080
You know.

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:41.760
Yep, that was long, so I don't know.

01:43:41.760 --> 01:43:43.240
Sorry. Yeah, exactly.

01:43:43.240 --> 01:43:46.960
Again, like no medicine, I hopefully inshallah tomorrow.

01:43:47.760 --> 01:43:49.520
I do pretty much agree.

01:43:49.520 --> 01:43:52.480
I mean, I was one of those skeptics back in like 2014.

01:43:52.480 --> 01:43:54.000
I was I was in Gamergate.

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.080
I remember I'm old enough to remember that shit.

01:43:56.320 --> 01:44:00.160
I mean, my first time on the Internet was like 1997.

01:44:00.160 --> 01:44:02.760
I was a kid, but still, I'm I'm pretty old now, you know.

01:44:02.880 --> 01:44:05.120
How old are you old enough?

01:44:05.360 --> 01:44:07.040
Old enough. Old enough.

01:44:07.040 --> 01:44:08.760
I was I was a 90s kid for sure.

01:44:08.760 --> 01:44:10.920
And there are so many zoomers right now who don't remember

01:44:10.920 --> 01:44:13.080
what it was like before 9-11, which is wild to me.

01:44:13.400 --> 01:44:15.200
I guess this is what it's like getting older, you know?

01:44:15.200 --> 01:44:17.040
Yeah, I was born in 95.

01:44:17.040 --> 01:44:22.480
And like I I got just like the tail end of like the good times.

01:44:22.680 --> 01:44:27.360
And then like everything since like 9-11 has just been like like a shit fest.

01:44:27.360 --> 01:44:30.760
Like I feel really bad for my little brother because he was born in 99.

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:34.840
And so he doesn't remember before 9-11 and he missed all of it.

01:44:34.840 --> 01:44:37.000
He missed all he missed all of the good shit.

01:44:37.200 --> 01:44:39.600
And then like everything from then on, like

01:44:40.240 --> 01:44:42.480
especially with my family being so politically active, like

01:44:42.720 --> 01:44:45.800
it was like constant in the household, like arguing about this stuff

01:44:45.800 --> 01:44:49.360
and seeing it happen on TV and all that shit. So.

01:44:50.400 --> 01:44:53.880
So for me, the most striking thing

01:44:53.880 --> 01:44:57.520
is how many of those old skeptic conversations

01:44:58.360 --> 01:45:00.840
we were right about speaking as a former skeptic.

01:45:00.840 --> 01:45:02.440
We were actually correct about a lot of them.

01:45:02.440 --> 01:45:06.320
You know, back then, it wasn't it wasn't an alt right joke.

01:45:06.320 --> 01:45:10.600
It was just one of our jokes was the attack helicopter gender thing.

01:45:10.600 --> 01:45:14.360
Yeah. And then and then it became an alt right thing.

01:45:14.600 --> 01:45:17.720
It's like, oh, my God, only only like racist Nazis make that joke.

01:45:17.720 --> 01:45:21.360
And that and now now you have demon mama on stream

01:45:21.360 --> 01:45:24.960
saying attack helicopter gender is legitimate. Yes.

01:45:25.280 --> 01:45:28.880
It's like we we knew that

01:45:29.200 --> 01:45:32.400
this philosophy was going to lead to this point eventually.

01:45:32.400 --> 01:45:35.280
And we called it like almost a decade ago.

01:45:35.960 --> 01:45:39.560
We knew it was going here and it went there, you know, like.

01:45:40.440 --> 01:45:45.320
So I'm at some I've been I'm being urged by chud logic

01:45:45.520 --> 01:45:48.800
to eventually compile all the information that I have

01:45:49.320 --> 01:45:53.360
on why there seems to be a section of the left,

01:45:53.760 --> 01:45:57.520
not all the left, but a section of the left that is extremely pro pedophile

01:45:58.400 --> 01:45:59.640
and why that's the case.

01:45:59.640 --> 01:46:02.360
Very strange. I have

01:46:02.360 --> 01:46:04.560
and I'm going to I'm going to put that together

01:46:04.560 --> 01:46:08.640
and put it out because there's a philosophical backing behind it.

01:46:08.800 --> 01:46:11.400
There's a bunch of literature, a bunch of political science literature

01:46:11.400 --> 01:46:12.000
that I can put out.

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.000
It's like, well, here's here's what this guy said.

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:15.560
And here's how how it influenced this guy.

01:46:15.560 --> 01:46:16.960
And here's this guy.

01:46:16.960 --> 01:46:20.760
And it runs directly down through the heart of postmodernism.

01:46:21.640 --> 01:46:25.440
Yeah, because you have guys like Foucault and Derrida who are out there like

01:46:26.120 --> 01:46:29.720
like fucking fucking boys and was in Tunisia or something.

01:46:29.720 --> 01:46:31.120
And they're advocating for

01:46:31.120 --> 01:46:34.160
age of consent to be revoked as part of the socialist project.

01:46:34.440 --> 01:46:38.600
Because as it turns out, the class of adults and the class of children

01:46:38.600 --> 01:46:42.280
also need to be equalized and have the power imbalances removed.

01:46:42.560 --> 01:46:44.520
Like it's it's it's insane.

01:46:44.800 --> 01:46:46.040
It's insane, right?

01:46:46.040 --> 01:46:50.400
But there is like political science, texts and literature and essays

01:46:50.400 --> 01:46:53.080
and books written about the stuff that I can put forward and be like, OK, well,

01:46:53.280 --> 01:46:56.320
here's how this mindset might lead

01:46:56.320 --> 01:46:59.520
and has led to this thinking in some people today.

01:46:59.960 --> 01:47:02.520
And I think I can put together a pretty decent case.

01:47:02.520 --> 01:47:05.000
So Chud, Chudlogic is like, you got to do this video at some point.

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:05.960
It's going to be spicy as fuck.

01:47:05.960 --> 01:47:07.960
And I'm like, yeah, I know why you want me to do it, right?

01:47:08.800 --> 01:47:10.040
I understand that.

01:47:10.040 --> 01:47:13.400
Yeah, I'm I'm I'd actually be interested to see that.

01:47:13.400 --> 01:47:17.480
I'm like 50 50 on like looking at

01:47:18.480 --> 01:47:22.760
philosophers from like the like 1800s to the mid 20th century.

01:47:23.480 --> 01:47:27.800
And trying to like follow like a direct line of

01:47:29.040 --> 01:47:31.560
like secession to like see where we're at now.

01:47:32.920 --> 01:47:35.120
Like especially like

01:47:35.120 --> 01:47:37.680
being someone who's like interested in going into education.

01:47:37.680 --> 01:47:40.160
I want to like like teach at the high school level.

01:47:40.960 --> 01:47:44.280
I see all these people talking about like groomers in schools and stuff.

01:47:44.280 --> 01:47:48.200
And do you know the Fabian Liberty guy? Yep.

01:47:48.320 --> 01:47:52.520
Yeah, he has he seems like one of his like biggest issues is like

01:47:53.080 --> 01:47:56.440
the the postmodernist, like socialist agenda

01:47:56.440 --> 01:47:59.520
in in schools to groom children into being socialists.

01:47:59.800 --> 01:48:02.400
And like you can.

01:48:04.160 --> 01:48:08.200
Find like some parts of some philosophies

01:48:08.200 --> 01:48:11.000
from postmodern thinkers in.

01:48:11.960 --> 01:48:16.040
In some like initiatives like social, emotional learning,

01:48:16.040 --> 01:48:18.360
which I need to learn more about

01:48:18.360 --> 01:48:20.760
in these like initiatives.

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:24.160
But like I I don't know how much I'm sold on it,

01:48:24.160 --> 01:48:29.440
like being like this like grand agenda that's been like spanned spanning.

01:48:29.520 --> 01:48:31.360
And I don't think that's what you're saying.

01:48:31.360 --> 01:48:34.040
But like there's like this like.

01:48:34.040 --> 01:48:36.800
Thought right now, especially like James Lindsay and people like that

01:48:37.120 --> 01:48:40.040
who are like saying like there's this grand

01:48:40.840 --> 01:48:44.880
initiative from socialists to like make everybody into these

01:48:45.600 --> 01:48:47.840
critical thinking

01:48:47.880 --> 01:48:50.240
people who are.

01:48:50.240 --> 01:48:53.440
You're talking like Biden's 1619 projects, stuff like that, right?

01:48:53.800 --> 01:48:56.800
Yeah, like they're like, yeah, there's like critical race theory

01:48:56.800 --> 01:48:57.720
and there's critical theory.

01:48:57.720 --> 01:49:00.600
And like they're trying to like push this on to like young kids

01:49:00.600 --> 01:49:03.200
to do like certain things

01:49:03.200 --> 01:49:06.040
to like either like indoctrinate them

01:49:06.040 --> 01:49:08.640
into gender theory or some shit like that.

01:49:08.880 --> 01:49:12.760
And I don't I don't know how sold I am on that, like coming from

01:49:13.160 --> 01:49:16.080
like working in elementary schools and like seeing

01:49:16.080 --> 01:49:18.280
what is actually being taught in elementary schools.

01:49:18.880 --> 01:49:19.920
Granted, I'm in Texas.

01:49:19.920 --> 01:49:22.360
So like maybe that like skews my

01:49:23.240 --> 01:49:25.080
maybe the things very like hard.

01:49:25.080 --> 01:49:27.720
But so I don't see I think there's some of it.

01:49:28.160 --> 01:49:30.160
Karl Marx and shit, you know.

01:49:30.160 --> 01:49:34.000
I think there I think there's definitely some people who do that,

01:49:34.360 --> 01:49:36.440
like there's going to be some individual teachers

01:49:36.440 --> 01:49:38.720
who who are absolutely biased in that direction.

01:49:38.720 --> 01:49:40.720
They absolutely want to do that sort of thing.

01:49:42.120 --> 01:49:44.640
I don't think they constitute like a

01:49:44.640 --> 01:49:47.640
they can actual conspiracy of an organized group

01:49:47.640 --> 01:49:49.480
to actually do all this sort of stuff.

01:49:49.480 --> 01:49:52.400
But I don't think they have to because they all have the

01:49:53.360 --> 01:49:54.560
the same training, the same education.

01:49:54.560 --> 01:49:57.320
They all kind of have the same ideas, so they do it in a decentralized way.

01:49:57.760 --> 01:50:00.920
However, I do think something

01:50:01.400 --> 01:50:05.520
I do think it's much more prevalent at the university level than it is at the.

01:50:05.560 --> 01:50:07.560
Yeah, at the grade school level.

01:50:07.560 --> 01:50:09.000
And the university level, it's all over the fucking place.

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:10.440
It's everywhere in the university level.

01:50:10.440 --> 01:50:12.400
I don't think that it's common.

01:50:12.400 --> 01:50:16.840
Like I've had out of all of my professors that I've had in Poli Sci,

01:50:16.840 --> 01:50:19.200
I think I've had one conservative,

01:50:19.200 --> 01:50:22.120
two centrists and all the rest of them seem to be like lefties.

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:26.280
So like, I definitely do agree that there's like a bias

01:50:26.280 --> 01:50:29.360
in academia for like left leaning opinions.

01:50:30.960 --> 01:50:32.840
But I don't think that it's

01:50:32.840 --> 01:50:34.440
and again, this is like all anecdote.

01:50:34.440 --> 01:50:38.040
I can't speak for every college campus or anything like I don't.

01:50:38.040 --> 01:50:41.320
I don't feel like it's ever been to a point where people can't

01:50:41.320 --> 01:50:45.080
think for themselves or like get low grades because they're conservative

01:50:45.080 --> 01:50:45.840
or anything.

01:50:45.840 --> 01:50:50.000
I but then again, I don't know what all the arguments about like academia being

01:50:51.320 --> 01:50:54.520
skewed in one way or another are, so

01:50:54.520 --> 01:50:57.520
I think the academia being skewed in one way or another, that's

01:50:58.040 --> 01:50:59.800
that is an important conversation.

01:50:59.800 --> 01:51:03.600
And yeah, I mean, even though I'm a bit older, I do remember seeing it happen

01:51:03.600 --> 01:51:05.560
when I went when I went to university, you know,

01:51:05.560 --> 01:51:07.600
people having the wrong opinions and getting less grades.

01:51:07.600 --> 01:51:11.240
I did see that it was mainly in the gender studies courses.

01:51:11.240 --> 01:51:13.080
I took, though, not in anything else.

01:51:13.080 --> 01:51:15.800
Oh, really? Yeah, I haven't taken any of those.

01:51:15.800 --> 01:51:17.960
So luckily,

01:51:19.360 --> 01:51:21.840
but I think like when it comes to the whole groomer thing

01:51:22.400 --> 01:51:26.800
is like the one that I like to talk about is the case in California

01:51:26.800 --> 01:51:28.440
where there were two

01:51:28.440 --> 01:51:31.480
there were two gender queer teachers at an elementary school

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:36.040
and they were using their authority to basically spy on students.

01:51:36.360 --> 01:51:39.520
They would go in, they'd log in with with their administrative

01:51:39.520 --> 01:51:43.080
and their administrator password or whatever into the schools

01:51:43.320 --> 01:51:44.920
in the school computer system.

01:51:44.920 --> 01:51:49.160
They would see they would like look at the key loggers of various student logins

01:51:49.520 --> 01:51:51.840
and see what and see what these kids were talking like.

01:51:51.840 --> 01:51:56.160
Probably grade two to grade six, you know, so reasonably young.

01:51:57.040 --> 01:51:59.880
They would see what these kids were doing.

01:51:59.880 --> 01:52:02.040
What they were searching on Google using the key logger.

01:52:02.360 --> 01:52:05.080
They would pick out people who were searching about things

01:52:05.280 --> 01:52:08.000
that might have been related to gender or trans stuff

01:52:08.160 --> 01:52:12.400
or like like gay questioning or whatever things that could be construed in that way.

01:52:12.720 --> 01:52:15.040
They would pick those people out, write down their names for later,

01:52:15.240 --> 01:52:18.560
and then single them out at some point and invite them to

01:52:19.640 --> 01:52:21.800
to a gender club.

01:52:22.320 --> 01:52:26.520
And this club was not the school's normal, the normal pride club.

01:52:26.520 --> 01:52:28.600
It was like their own thing that they had been running on the side.

01:52:28.960 --> 01:52:32.720
And once in that club, these two teachers would convince these kids

01:52:32.720 --> 01:52:35.920
that they're trans and tell them not to tell their parents, because if they

01:52:36.320 --> 01:52:39.640
it because of the nasty Republicans in the government,

01:52:39.880 --> 01:52:43.480
if you're if anyone learns that you're trans, you'll be taken away from your parents.

01:52:43.880 --> 01:52:46.560
So the only person that you can tell is is us.

01:52:46.880 --> 01:52:48.520
And like they would love bomb them.

01:52:48.520 --> 01:52:50.720
But then they would also say, listen, it has to be a secret.

01:52:50.720 --> 01:52:53.680
And it ended up getting to like there's this one.

01:52:53.960 --> 01:52:57.440
There's this one little girl who they tried to convince very strongly

01:52:57.440 --> 01:52:59.840
that she was that she was a trans man.

01:52:59.840 --> 01:53:01.960
She was not she turned out just to be bisexual.

01:53:02.520 --> 01:53:04.160
She found out a little bit later in life.

01:53:04.160 --> 01:53:06.200
But eventually this all blew up and it was discovered.

01:53:06.480 --> 01:53:09.920
And these two these two teachers are now being

01:53:10.280 --> 01:53:13.400
dragged through the legal system as they should, because that's pretty monstrous

01:53:13.400 --> 01:53:15.960
what they did. But here's the thing.

01:53:15.960 --> 01:53:17.360
I can tell you that story.

01:53:17.360 --> 01:53:19.640
And it's a it's a case of legitimate grooming

01:53:20.080 --> 01:53:23.080
happening by by these two terrible teachers. Sure. All right.

01:53:23.320 --> 01:53:26.720
And it had its 15 minutes of fame on lives of TikTok and all of it.

01:53:27.240 --> 01:53:32.240
However, because that story is so sensationalist, it sticks in people's minds

01:53:32.240 --> 01:53:35.120
and people think, oh, this is every time I see. Yeah.

01:53:35.120 --> 01:53:38.480
Yes. Every time I see, you know, a blue haired person on Twitter

01:53:38.680 --> 01:53:41.720
who hangs a Black Lives Matter flag in their in their

01:53:42.040 --> 01:53:44.640
their classroom, regardless of whether or not that's appropriate.

01:53:44.840 --> 01:53:48.000
The fact that they're doing they must also be secretly grooming kids, too.

01:53:48.080 --> 01:53:51.320
And everyone that I see on lives of TikTok has to be secretly grooming kids.

01:53:51.480 --> 01:53:55.040
And as soon as you see like even 20 legitimate stories of it happening,

01:53:55.200 --> 01:53:57.200
you think it's happening everywhere.

01:53:57.200 --> 01:54:02.080
But 20 stories in a nation of 330 million people isn't actually that many people.

01:54:02.400 --> 01:54:03.920
You know, it's still bad,

01:54:03.920 --> 01:54:07.280
but it's not happening at the rates that right wing people think it's happening.

01:54:07.280 --> 01:54:08.400
One thousand percent.

01:54:08.400 --> 01:54:11.080
That's exactly what I mean, because every single time this topic comes up,

01:54:11.240 --> 01:54:13.800
I say, like, can you show me any example of this happening?

01:54:13.800 --> 01:54:17.520
Like at like a district wide level where this is like some sort of policy

01:54:17.520 --> 01:54:21.160
that they're like going forward and like, you know, having clubs

01:54:21.160 --> 01:54:23.960
where like people come out as trans and give them hormones

01:54:23.960 --> 01:54:26.520
or give them like the information of how to access hormones

01:54:26.920 --> 01:54:28.160
without their parents knowledge.

01:54:28.160 --> 01:54:31.520
Can you give me any like curriculum that's being implemented

01:54:31.520 --> 01:54:33.880
in like either a state or a local level?

01:54:33.880 --> 01:54:38.480
That's like like trying to like indoctrinate people into gender theory,

01:54:38.480 --> 01:54:42.840
fucking, you know, critical theory, critical race theory shit.

01:54:43.040 --> 01:54:44.480
Like, can you show me any of this shit?

01:54:44.480 --> 01:54:47.160
And like, I might get like one example of like a teacher

01:54:47.160 --> 01:54:49.240
going like a little bit too far or like doing something

01:54:49.240 --> 01:54:51.760
that's like pretty objectively horrible, like

01:54:52.640 --> 01:54:54.720
depends on like what the scale of it is. Right.

01:54:56.560 --> 01:54:59.760
Or like a charter school, like an individual school

01:54:59.760 --> 01:55:03.480
that does not like that is not beholden to like a whole school

01:55:04.280 --> 01:55:06.120
school wide system

01:55:06.520 --> 01:55:09.520
implementing something, but never something on like a grand scale.

01:55:09.520 --> 01:55:11.920
And that's what I would have to see in order to be like, OK, yep,

01:55:11.920 --> 01:55:14.200
we've gone too far. This is this is fucking crazy.

01:55:14.400 --> 01:55:16.920
I think that individual teachers absolutely should be like

01:55:17.560 --> 01:55:22.280
should use much greater discretion on when and where to talk about

01:55:22.280 --> 01:55:25.360
like sexuality and shit like that, because there are like

01:55:25.520 --> 01:55:28.440
there are some things like there are famous authors.

01:55:28.440 --> 01:55:30.040
I don't know.

01:55:30.040 --> 01:55:32.240
I can see his face, maybe Oscar Wilde,

01:55:32.440 --> 01:55:34.920
who was a gay man or a bisexual man or something like that.

01:55:35.040 --> 01:55:36.360
And that might have called you gay. Yeah.

01:55:36.360 --> 01:55:39.040
Yeah. That might have colored some of his writing.

01:55:39.040 --> 01:55:42.520
And maybe that's something that is relevant to bring up in a certain context.

01:55:42.520 --> 01:55:45.680
Right. And that shouldn't be like off limits to talk about.

01:55:45.880 --> 01:55:49.160
But like if you're like teaching fucking math, like there's no reason

01:55:49.160 --> 01:55:51.440
to like talk about fucking like gender shit. Right.

01:55:52.200 --> 01:55:55.480
Like even in biology, I don't think that that's necessarily

01:55:56.040 --> 01:55:58.400
a good place to talk about it.

01:55:58.400 --> 01:56:02.400
But if you're like taking a health class, that's probably like more appropriate

01:56:03.080 --> 01:56:05.720
to talk about that, depending on what the age level is

01:56:05.720 --> 01:56:07.880
and what the conversation is. Right.

01:56:08.040 --> 01:56:10.680
It has to be like matched to like the appropriate age level

01:56:10.680 --> 01:56:13.120
and the context of what it is, you know.

01:56:14.560 --> 01:56:18.680
But yeah, like every time I ask for any kind of example of this

01:56:18.680 --> 01:56:22.480
happening at mass scale, I never, ever, ever get examples of it

01:56:22.720 --> 01:56:25.000
except for like a lives of TikTok tweet.

01:56:25.280 --> 01:56:28.200
And that like bugs the fuck out of me.

01:56:28.400 --> 01:56:31.960
That like we can't, you know, pass anecdote. Yeah.

01:56:33.040 --> 01:56:36.320
Even if you assume that every single case

01:56:36.320 --> 01:56:39.920
on lives of TikTok is exactly as she presents it,

01:56:40.400 --> 01:56:44.720
that's still not enough to say like there's a huge problem in America.

01:56:44.760 --> 01:56:46.200
That's still a minority of people.

01:56:46.200 --> 01:56:48.560
You know, it's still bad, still has to be stopped.

01:56:48.600 --> 01:56:51.320
But it's not like it's happening everywhere all the time.

01:56:51.560 --> 01:56:53.960
And therefore, you need to pull your kids out of school immediately

01:56:54.240 --> 01:56:55.400
or else they're going to turn gay.

01:56:55.400 --> 01:56:57.400
Like that's that's a bit too far for me.

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:00.480
Yeah. What do you think about all the

01:57:00.480 --> 01:57:02.480
the like conservative parents saying that we need to

01:57:03.400 --> 01:57:06.040
pull all of our kids out of school and start homeschooling them?

01:57:06.880 --> 01:57:09.080
Because it feels like if anybody is talking about

01:57:10.200 --> 01:57:13.640
like actively politically grooming, even if we're not talking about

01:57:13.640 --> 01:57:16.520
like sexually grooming, like politically grooming children

01:57:17.080 --> 01:57:20.760
into some sort of ideology, it would be the people who are like, no, like the

01:57:21.200 --> 01:57:26.120
like the the tested curriculums that are being taught in public schools

01:57:26.120 --> 01:57:27.280
across the country.

01:57:27.280 --> 01:57:30.240
That is that is way too far left.

01:57:30.400 --> 01:57:33.480
We're going to teach people about like our version of history.

01:57:33.480 --> 01:57:35.080
1776 project.

01:57:35.080 --> 01:57:40.280
Let's fucking go at home and don't interact with anyone that disagrees with you.

01:57:40.880 --> 01:57:45.280
To be honest, I actually don't necessarily mind the idea of 1776.

01:57:45.360 --> 01:57:48.720
I mean, you should probably be taught the good things that America has done

01:57:48.720 --> 01:57:49.520
in its history.

01:57:49.520 --> 01:57:52.920
You don't need to be you don't need to be bludgeoning kids at five years old

01:57:52.920 --> 01:57:55.280
or seven years old or something about all the negative stuff

01:57:55.480 --> 01:57:58.000
that can wait until they have some more critical thinking skills.

01:57:58.000 --> 01:57:59.120
You know, you should.

01:57:59.120 --> 01:58:01.960
High school is probably where you should start talking about like

01:58:02.240 --> 01:58:05.280
slavery in detail or like the yeah, yeah.

01:58:05.320 --> 01:58:08.000
Native American genocide shit that happened, you know, like

01:58:09.640 --> 01:58:11.680
but for me.

01:58:13.920 --> 01:58:17.440
And again, like maybe I maybe I'm just old and this isn't what they taught us

01:58:17.440 --> 01:58:21.960
and when I was in school, right, I'm 27 years old and I'm old and have arthritis.

01:58:22.160 --> 01:58:26.760
But I don't feel like I was ever like bludgeoned

01:58:26.760 --> 01:58:30.200
with how bad America was and like I graduated in 2014.

01:58:30.200 --> 01:58:32.640
So like there was a lot of like the Tumblr shit going on.

01:58:32.640 --> 01:58:34.640
Maybe it's changed a lot since then.

01:58:34.640 --> 01:58:39.160
But yeah, it feels like people aren't being taught

01:58:39.440 --> 01:58:41.560
just like how evil America is.

01:58:42.480 --> 01:58:45.480
Maybe there are young people in chat that can.

01:58:45.480 --> 01:58:48.920
Disagree with that, but it feels like there's a pretty like.

01:58:49.920 --> 01:58:52.640
The slavery, slavery was bad

01:58:52.920 --> 01:58:57.520
and it was bad to be a clan member, and like that's about as as like.

01:58:57.520 --> 01:59:00.120
So I was in high school.

01:59:00.120 --> 01:59:02.480
I was in high school in the mid 2000s.

01:59:02.480 --> 01:59:05.280
And I remember.

01:59:05.280 --> 01:59:08.520
I remember a teacher, it was in a civics class,

01:59:08.520 --> 01:59:12.800
it was last year of high school for me in civics.

01:59:13.360 --> 01:59:16.000
And a teacher says.

01:59:16.040 --> 01:59:19.840
And she was in retrospect, she was she was very far left, even for the time.

01:59:20.200 --> 01:59:22.760
And she said, well.

01:59:22.760 --> 01:59:25.600
It's completely fine for black people to say

01:59:26.480 --> 01:59:29.400
black pride, but white people can't say white pride.

01:59:30.240 --> 01:59:32.640
And then she talked about the intersectional reason as to why

01:59:32.640 --> 01:59:36.080
and you know, who has historically had power and all this stuff.

01:59:36.280 --> 01:59:38.800
And I was like, well, that sounds kind of stupid, right?

01:59:38.800 --> 01:59:40.280
And the entire class like that sounds stupid.

01:59:40.280 --> 01:59:41.800
Shouldn't it be equal for everything?

01:59:41.800 --> 01:59:44.840
We were all we're all like liberal normies, right?

01:59:44.880 --> 01:59:46.520
So that that all sounds kind of stupid.

01:59:46.520 --> 01:59:48.480
And she was like, no, that's how that's how it is.

01:59:48.480 --> 01:59:49.480
And she was like,

01:59:49.480 --> 01:59:53.040
she she got so much pushback from the entire class that she dropped it.

01:59:53.520 --> 01:59:55.480
So this was mid 2000s.

01:59:55.480 --> 01:59:58.880
So there was at least one person in my experience trying to push it

01:59:58.880 --> 02:00:00.440
and it wasn't really sticking.

02:00:00.440 --> 02:00:03.360
But then by the time I got to I went to university, dropped out,

02:00:03.440 --> 02:00:06.880
went back to university on my second time through university.

02:00:07.400 --> 02:00:10.880
It was completely it was completely

02:00:11.760 --> 02:00:14.440
it was all intersectional and everyone was cool with it.

02:00:14.440 --> 02:00:18.800
And if you if you gave a non intersectional take in a lot of these classes,

02:00:18.800 --> 02:00:21.640
you would actually get punished for it by the professor. So

02:00:22.560 --> 02:00:26.440
I have seen the progression of things and how things have changed over time.

02:00:27.320 --> 02:00:30.920
So I do think it's probably gotten even more in

02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:34.400
in that direction since we've both left school. Yeah.

02:00:34.680 --> 02:00:38.120
If you were to go into into like a high school class right now,

02:00:38.120 --> 02:00:41.080
they're probably actually here.

02:00:41.240 --> 02:00:43.520
I I was searching this up.

02:00:43.520 --> 02:00:44.880
I don't know if you've seen this.

02:00:44.880 --> 02:00:47.080
You mentioned math, right?

02:00:47.080 --> 02:00:50.680
Oh, is this going to be like the black kids can't learn unless they're dancing thing?

02:00:51.240 --> 02:00:55.360
No, no, no. The the deconstructing racism in mathematics.

02:00:57.240 --> 02:01:00.400
You see shit like this all the time, all the time.

02:01:00.400 --> 02:01:03.360
And like, even if there's something of value in here,

02:01:03.680 --> 02:01:07.360
the when something like this goes viral on Twitter, you're like,

02:01:08.160 --> 02:01:11.160
you're like, what the what the fuck? Why is this?

02:01:11.560 --> 02:01:16.040
You know, why is there a greater like this is like a criticism in regular math.

02:01:16.040 --> 02:01:18.240
There is a greater focus on getting the right answer

02:01:18.240 --> 02:01:21.240
than understanding concepts and reasoning. And it's like, well.

02:01:22.320 --> 02:01:23.880
Talk about math here, you know?

02:01:23.880 --> 02:01:29.200
Yeah, I do have to I could I could steel man that it's not necessarily wrong.

02:01:29.520 --> 02:01:33.680
But fuck the framing of it, like as dismantling white supremacy

02:01:33.680 --> 02:01:38.320
is so fucking dog shit like the the steel man of that that I would give is like

02:01:39.320 --> 02:01:43.440
there are a lot of I was able to pass all of my math classes in high school,

02:01:43.440 --> 02:01:46.000
but I did not understand the fucking concepts.

02:01:46.200 --> 02:01:48.600
OK, I like memorize some of the fucking

02:01:49.600 --> 02:01:51.440
formulas and I just,

02:01:51.440 --> 02:01:54.720
you know, plugged and played and like prayed to get through it. But.

02:01:56.480 --> 02:02:00.200
I feel like I would probably be like significantly better at math

02:02:00.200 --> 02:02:04.360
and probably a smarter person overall, if I was able to understand the concepts

02:02:04.360 --> 02:02:07.680
and the reasoning behind like why we get to this point, like I

02:02:08.640 --> 02:02:12.280
I recently had to learn some of the oh, shit, what do they call it? The.

02:02:13.760 --> 02:02:17.360
Oh, there's like a kind of like doing a way of doing math

02:02:17.360 --> 02:02:21.360
that triggers the fuck out of conservatives and like older people nowadays.

02:02:23.440 --> 02:02:25.400
It's going to kill me until I get

02:02:25.400 --> 02:02:30.640
until someone says it, but I'm like, like seeing how like they're teaching math

02:02:30.640 --> 02:02:33.960
now in elementary school, it's like, oh, that's how I do math in my head. Right.

02:02:34.880 --> 02:02:37.720
And like this is like a really great way

02:02:37.920 --> 02:02:41.560
to like teach people from a very, very young age. Right.

02:02:42.360 --> 02:02:45.320
Well, Common Core, thank you, Sir Wolfgang based

02:02:45.880 --> 02:02:49.080
like the Common Core thing is like actually super fucking base.

02:02:49.080 --> 02:02:50.680
It's honestly super cool.

02:02:50.680 --> 02:02:55.600
And the strategies that they're teaching kids using Common Core is really, really

02:02:56.240 --> 02:02:59.600
like a great way to build those critical thinking skills at a very young age.

02:02:59.840 --> 02:03:04.400
But like the the framing of the like picture that you sent,

02:03:04.400 --> 02:03:07.560
like the dismantling white supremacy in math classrooms

02:03:08.120 --> 02:03:11.560
is so unbelievably fucking cringy.

02:03:11.760 --> 02:03:15.040
And like there's another streamer

02:03:15.880 --> 02:03:19.840
that I've argued with in the past and that just argued with Kefle's poly people

02:03:20.120 --> 02:03:23.600
who I've noticed this big trend with lefties where like

02:03:24.200 --> 02:03:28.200
we can't argue like the the actual topic that we're arguing about

02:03:28.200 --> 02:03:32.080
because I have to like move five or six layers of separation

02:03:32.080 --> 02:03:35.040
away from that thing in order to argue about white supremacy.

02:03:35.240 --> 02:03:39.280
And I feel like that is a dog shit way to explain the world to most people.

02:03:39.440 --> 02:03:44.600
Right. Outside of like hyper academic circles that are trying to explain,

02:03:44.680 --> 02:03:49.880
you know, like expansive sociological issues. Right.

02:03:51.600 --> 02:03:55.160
So like I could I could understand what they're saying here,

02:03:55.160 --> 02:03:59.320
but like to call it white supremacy, to get the right answer is so fucking stupid

02:03:59.640 --> 02:04:02.680
and it makes the left look so fucking retarded.

02:04:03.680 --> 02:04:05.480
Well, so you've seen this then, right?

02:04:05.480 --> 02:04:07.680
Because this is kind of where that comes from.

02:04:07.680 --> 02:04:09.880
This is from the Smithsonian in 2020.

02:04:09.880 --> 02:04:11.880
This is a very well known thing that got pulled.

02:04:11.880 --> 02:04:14.640
It was like a. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

02:04:15.240 --> 02:04:19.360
So white culture is individualism and having a nuclear family.

02:04:19.360 --> 02:04:21.040
Emphasis on the scientific method.

02:04:21.040 --> 02:04:24.760
Predecent work, work ethic, hard work is the key to success.

02:04:24.960 --> 02:04:26.200
Work before play.

02:04:26.200 --> 02:04:28.320
If you didn't meet your goals, you didn't work hard enough.

02:04:28.520 --> 02:04:30.240
Like how is that whiteness?

02:04:30.240 --> 02:04:32.920
Are you saying that nonwhite people are lazy? Like what?

02:04:33.440 --> 02:04:36.000
Yeah. Oh, my God. Messaging.

02:04:36.200 --> 02:04:39.600
But because it like fits into the kind of

02:04:41.320 --> 02:04:44.200
ideals that they're trying to push, like to try like

02:04:44.400 --> 02:04:47.520
because I feel like when I started being a leftist, the critiques

02:04:47.520 --> 02:04:50.560
that were being levied were relatively reasonable.

02:04:50.560 --> 02:04:52.960
Maybe there were like a couple of things that might have been a stretch,

02:04:53.080 --> 02:04:55.120
but they were like relatively reasonable.

02:04:55.120 --> 02:05:00.880
But like over time, since, you know, like 20, fuck 2016

02:05:01.560 --> 02:05:04.440
when I started getting Trump got elected and everyone went insane. Yeah.

02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:08.200
Well, yeah, I hate to say it like that, but

02:05:09.280 --> 02:05:12.240
like there was probably a lead up, especially online,

02:05:12.240 --> 02:05:15.160
that I wasn't aware of because I just wasn't an online person.

02:05:15.360 --> 02:05:18.760
But like when I was like watching YouTube videos,

02:05:18.760 --> 02:05:20.960
it feels like so many of those things were like relatively reasonable.

02:05:20.960 --> 02:05:23.120
Like, oh, we can look at like how,

02:05:24.800 --> 02:05:28.760
you know, Jim Crow laws could still affect people nowadays. Right.

02:05:28.920 --> 02:05:31.520
OK, that's pretty reasonable. I can understand how that happened. Right.

02:05:31.680 --> 02:05:35.520
But then like it kept on going forward and kept on going forward. And.

02:05:36.560 --> 02:05:41.120
You know, I can like see the through line of how people got to the position

02:05:41.120 --> 02:05:45.480
that we're at now with like working hard as white culture. Right.

02:05:45.880 --> 02:05:49.720
Or like being on time is white culture, like that thing says.

02:05:49.920 --> 02:05:54.400
But it's just just a fucking insane way

02:05:54.400 --> 02:05:57.960
to frame all of our conversations around white supremacy.

02:06:00.040 --> 02:06:03.080
And it's because because of that

02:06:03.080 --> 02:06:07.840
conversation was being had in 2015, 2016, 2017. Right.

02:06:09.960 --> 02:06:12.680
People really know these arguments in and out. Right.

02:06:13.200 --> 02:06:16.360
And that's all they can argue, because that's what they've been hearing

02:06:16.360 --> 02:06:19.160
for the past, you know, nearly 10 years.

02:06:19.640 --> 02:06:21.800
And so, yeah, because that's all they've heard.

02:06:21.960 --> 02:06:23.440
That's all they know how to argue.

02:06:23.440 --> 02:06:25.560
And that's because it's all they know how to argue.

02:06:25.720 --> 02:06:30.040
Every conversation has to be brought back all those layers of separation

02:06:30.040 --> 02:06:33.920
to the original like seed that was planted in your mind.

02:06:33.920 --> 02:06:38.440
It's depressing as a left leaning person.

02:06:39.160 --> 02:06:40.960
So so when I mentioned earlier

02:06:40.960 --> 02:06:45.160
that that we saw this coming like eight, 10 years ago,

02:06:45.560 --> 02:06:47.280
this is another one of those things that we saw coming.

02:06:47.280 --> 02:06:51.320
We like we there you can probably go find like 2014, 2015

02:06:51.320 --> 02:06:56.960
era Sargon videos where he says one day the left will just be openly anti white

02:06:57.480 --> 02:06:59.000
and it will be because of this reason.

02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:00.960
And they're not there yet, but it'll be because of this reason.

02:07:01.360 --> 02:07:03.000
And it turns out that's where we are. Right.

02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:06.000
And I'm reminded of.

02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:09.480
To bring back the Internet's oldest boogeyman, Anita Sarkeesian,

02:07:09.880 --> 02:07:12.520
I'm reminded of that lecture she gave in 2015,

02:07:13.120 --> 02:07:16.480
where she talked about like linking up her feminism with socialism

02:07:16.760 --> 02:07:19.360
and how there has to be a true anti capitalist revolution.

02:07:19.360 --> 02:07:21.760
And I'm like, listen, no one watched this fucking thing

02:07:21.760 --> 02:07:23.360
because no one actually cares.

02:07:23.360 --> 02:07:27.320
But she was saying this in 2015 and no one was listening

02:07:27.400 --> 02:07:28.800
and people weren't really doing it,

02:07:28.800 --> 02:07:30.760
but they were eventually going to bring it there.

02:07:30.760 --> 02:07:32.520
And they did eventually bring it there.

02:07:32.520 --> 02:07:34.720
And it's like I said, with the attack helicopter thing,

02:07:34.920 --> 02:07:37.720
it went from being a joke to something somebody's

02:07:37.720 --> 02:07:41.440
actually advocating for because it's the natural end result of their logic.

02:07:41.720 --> 02:07:44.320
And I think that that.

02:07:45.480 --> 02:07:48.640
Modern leftism in its current form

02:07:48.960 --> 02:07:51.440
that we're seeing right now in the English speaking world

02:07:51.880 --> 02:07:55.360
was always going to lead here from where it was 10 years ago.

02:07:56.320 --> 02:07:59.240
Because it's just the natural end result of that logic, you know, if.

02:08:00.280 --> 02:08:03.960
You have intersectionality and then you have certain privileged groups

02:08:03.960 --> 02:08:06.720
and they're privileged because they're historically been underprivileged.

02:08:06.720 --> 02:08:09.240
And so we want to kind of equalize the playing field.

02:08:09.600 --> 02:08:13.360
You just take that point of view to its natural end result and you get this.

02:08:13.360 --> 02:08:16.680
You get all the shit that no one actually wants and no one actually believes in,

02:08:16.680 --> 02:08:19.000
except for the most the most crazy ideologues

02:08:19.160 --> 02:08:21.000
and also those people who benefit from it.

02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:23.520
But like, it's it's not good. It's not good where we are.

02:08:23.520 --> 02:08:25.640
The main reason one of the main reasons

02:08:25.640 --> 02:08:28.560
that I'm not a leftist is because of this shit, right? Yeah.

02:08:28.800 --> 02:08:31.720
The second a second big reason is because I was told a lot

02:08:32.040 --> 02:08:33.800
that I'm a liberal, not a leftist.

02:08:33.800 --> 02:08:35.200
And I was like, OK, fair enough.

02:08:35.200 --> 02:08:37.480
If being a liberal means that I'm on the right, then fine, I'm on the right.

02:08:37.520 --> 02:08:38.720
I don't care about that.

02:08:38.720 --> 02:08:40.880
You know, I don't give a shit about the label of left.

02:08:41.080 --> 02:08:43.440
Yeah, I for me, like.

02:08:46.080 --> 02:08:47.360
I feel like.

02:08:48.600 --> 02:08:53.360
Being being brought up as like a like a hardcore Democrat, right,

02:08:53.360 --> 02:08:57.880
like family ran for Democratic office and shit and like.

02:08:57.920 --> 02:08:59.560
So there was always those conversations,

02:08:59.560 --> 02:09:02.200
like the the path to like becoming a socialist,

02:09:02.200 --> 02:09:05.200
especially as like an ultra like young person

02:09:06.720 --> 02:09:09.800
was like pretty clear, especially

02:09:09.800 --> 02:09:14.600
like going back to the whole like lack of purpose in young men's life, like the.

02:09:16.360 --> 02:09:18.520
Trying to find like solutions

02:09:18.520 --> 02:09:22.040
for the the woes of the world was probably what got me there.

02:09:24.160 --> 02:09:26.640
But I guess I had a lot of young people.

02:09:26.640 --> 02:09:28.800
Yeah, a lot of people are like that. Yeah.

02:09:28.800 --> 02:09:32.200
And I feel like I I had more faith

02:09:32.200 --> 02:09:36.280
in people to like be reasonable about a lot of things

02:09:37.400 --> 02:09:39.760
until like really recently.

02:09:39.960 --> 02:09:43.240
I felt like eventually like, OK, well, this is really fucking stupid.

02:09:43.240 --> 02:09:45.120
But most people don't think that.

02:09:45.120 --> 02:09:50.120
I would I I think I would disagree that like the left is openly anti-white.

02:09:50.160 --> 02:09:53.120
I think that that's still like an ultra contentious

02:09:54.240 --> 02:09:57.240
topic in leftist circles.

02:09:57.240 --> 02:10:01.280
But like the the further left you get, the more that you do see people

02:10:01.280 --> 02:10:04.600
like actually just like actually being racist towards white people.

02:10:04.600 --> 02:10:06.360
It's like actually fucking insane.

02:10:06.360 --> 02:10:08.400
The kinds of shit that people will say.

02:10:08.400 --> 02:10:12.960
I learned some racial slurs for white people I didn't even know fucking existed

02:10:13.160 --> 02:10:17.680
until, you know, like I started arguing with people online, you know.

02:10:19.200 --> 02:10:23.480
So. I think I know what you mean.

02:10:23.480 --> 02:10:25.560
Yeah, I think I know what you mean.

02:10:26.560 --> 02:10:27.560
Shit, what were you saying?

02:10:27.560 --> 02:10:29.160
What do you say like three sentences ago?

02:10:29.160 --> 02:10:30.600
Because I had something I want to jump in with.

02:10:30.600 --> 02:10:31.600
I didn't jump in.

02:10:31.600 --> 02:10:36.160
I talked about starting off as a as a like hardcore Democrat,

02:10:36.160 --> 02:10:39.200
the obvious path to socialism. Yeah.

02:10:40.480 --> 02:10:42.400
Was it before or after that?

02:10:42.400 --> 02:10:44.040
I was after that. Yeah.

02:10:44.880 --> 02:10:47.280
Talked about how. Fuck.

02:10:47.800 --> 02:10:52.640
There's a the left is it's a contentious topic of being anti-white.

02:10:53.640 --> 02:10:55.520
It was before that, it was right in the middle.

02:10:55.520 --> 02:10:58.080
Oh, you know, here, I'll just go back and listen, I guess.

02:10:58.120 --> 02:11:00.640
OK, I'll look at chat for a second.

02:11:00.920 --> 02:11:02.640
I'll mute for a sec.

02:11:04.320 --> 02:11:05.920
Let's see here.

02:11:09.640 --> 02:11:12.400
If it's a white person would be late for an appointment,

02:11:12.400 --> 02:11:15.840
I'd be oppressing people of color because it would be so fucking stupid.

02:11:16.920 --> 02:11:21.320
Hey, guys, if you guys if you guys haven't already subscribed, you should.

02:11:22.640 --> 02:11:26.320
I got banned off of Twitch because of really stupid reasons.

02:11:26.520 --> 02:11:28.960
So this is now my only streaming platform

02:11:29.520 --> 02:11:32.400
besides like comfy dot stream or whatever the fuck.

02:11:32.640 --> 02:11:35.720
So subscribe, we're going to be putting out more videos.

02:11:35.720 --> 02:11:39.800
I have a. An editor and all that shit.

02:11:42.720 --> 02:11:44.200
Let me see here.

02:11:47.120 --> 02:11:49.800
Man, I can't I can't re find it.

02:11:49.800 --> 02:11:51.440
My brain's not bringing it back.

02:11:51.480 --> 02:11:53.120
Oh, damn. Thanks. Sorry.

02:11:53.120 --> 02:11:55.200
I guess this is just gone.

02:11:55.200 --> 02:11:56.360
I guess it's just gone. All right.

02:11:56.360 --> 02:11:59.440
P. Oh, shit.

02:12:01.720 --> 02:12:03.880
Man, was there anything else?

02:12:03.880 --> 02:12:08.440
Sure. I don't have anything unless there's

02:12:09.280 --> 02:12:11.560
something specific that you want to ask me.

02:12:12.240 --> 02:12:15.960
I know Stardust was she really wanted us to talk, but Stardust isn't even here.

02:12:16.720 --> 02:12:19.040
Well, the reason for that was

02:12:19.040 --> 02:12:22.000
on election night in November,

02:12:23.560 --> 02:12:27.560
I was just like panel hopping, just like seeing what everybody was saying.

02:12:28.680 --> 02:12:32.920
And we were going to be on the same panel, but then she jumped onto yours.

02:12:32.920 --> 02:12:37.080
I was like, OK, well, if he's if he has an open spot, see if he'll have me on.

02:12:37.840 --> 02:12:40.600
And she said that you thought that I hated you.

02:12:40.720 --> 02:12:43.080
I was like, I don't I don't know who the fuck this guy is.

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:47.880
That was back from when you because I think in 2020 or something,

02:12:48.200 --> 02:12:52.320
you were more of a socialist and we had had to get back and forth on Twitter.

02:12:52.800 --> 02:12:55.840
Yeah, I know exactly what the back and forth was because like

02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:59.160
I didn't know who the fuck you were, but you posted about like selling your website.

02:12:59.160 --> 02:13:02.840
I was like, I should I should buy the I should buy the

02:13:03.520 --> 02:13:06.680
domain name and have it linked back to my Twitch channel.

02:13:07.400 --> 02:13:10.040
So I don't think I was it to sell in 2020.

02:13:10.800 --> 02:13:13.520
Was it not that because that's the only time I've ever

02:13:14.400 --> 02:13:17.840
in that's the only like thing that I remember interacting with you on.

02:13:17.840 --> 02:13:20.280
But keep in mind, I've gone through like

02:13:20.600 --> 02:13:22.680
I go through a new Twitter account every six months or so.

02:13:22.680 --> 02:13:23.760
I always get banned.

02:13:23.760 --> 02:13:26.080
Well, so it

02:13:27.240 --> 02:13:30.320
yeah, no, it was definitely it was definitely something very socialist, though.

02:13:30.320 --> 02:13:33.800
And I was like, oh, yeah, I've probably said some really fucking retarded shit on Twitter.

02:13:33.800 --> 02:13:38.520
And but yeah, I've moved on.

02:13:38.520 --> 02:13:41.720
I've grown as a person, as a political thinker, you know.

02:13:42.240 --> 02:13:45.000
So, yeah, you've cucked out to the system.

02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:47.240
You're not a true revolutionary anymore.

02:13:47.240 --> 02:13:50.320
Yeah. No, you see, like as you get older, you

02:13:50.600 --> 02:13:53.440
you start getting comfortable with all the things that the system gives you.

02:13:53.440 --> 02:13:57.080
And then that's the only reason that I've gotten to this point is because I'm

02:13:57.520 --> 02:14:01.840
exploiting the the proletariat with all my bourgeois money

02:14:01.840 --> 02:14:05.600
that I'm making off of my YouTube, getting me sixty dollars a month. So

02:14:08.520 --> 02:14:10.600
fuck. Oh, man.

02:14:10.600 --> 02:14:13.560
So have you seen that that Trotsky bit about

02:14:14.880 --> 02:14:19.400
small businessmen, small business owners being being fascists?

02:14:20.480 --> 02:14:21.840
I have not.

02:14:21.840 --> 02:14:24.680
I never got like so deep into socialism that I knew like

02:14:24.960 --> 02:14:28.080
all of the different like thinkers positions on things.

02:14:28.280 --> 02:14:34.000
I think that my that I was like a total vosh

02:14:34.360 --> 02:14:38.480
brained, you know, market socialist for the longest time.

02:14:39.280 --> 02:14:42.920
I just liked things that sounded nice to like the the most amount of people.

02:14:43.520 --> 02:14:48.480
But then I started getting like as I started getting bigger on stream,

02:14:49.600 --> 02:14:51.840
I started getting into conversations with people that were like

02:14:52.840 --> 02:14:54.640
more and more difficult to argue against.

02:14:54.640 --> 02:14:58.520
And as like those arguments started, like

02:14:59.160 --> 02:15:01.920
I started getting blown the fuck out, especially like capitalism

02:15:01.920 --> 02:15:06.360
versus socialism debates, because I didn't know anything about capitalism.

02:15:06.360 --> 02:15:11.960
I had to do like more research into like specifically it was economics

02:15:11.960 --> 02:15:15.920
and philosophy that those two topics

02:15:16.720 --> 02:15:20.120
made me like understand like, oh, I can't do this.

02:15:20.120 --> 02:15:22.440
Socialism stuff like I can't like

02:15:24.160 --> 02:15:27.400
I have no basis for any of the things that I'm saying.

02:15:27.400 --> 02:15:29.080
Like, I don't believe any of these things.

02:15:29.080 --> 02:15:31.760
I didn't realize that this is what I was like talking about, you know?

02:15:32.600 --> 02:15:36.240
Yeah. And yeah, I don't like market socialism.

02:15:36.240 --> 02:15:39.680
Is is that philosophy that I know a lot of socialists

02:15:39.680 --> 02:15:42.960
want to use market socialism just to back a door in like further

02:15:43.240 --> 02:15:45.120
more crazy variants of socialism.

02:15:45.120 --> 02:15:49.080
But even markets like it sounds it sounds good to the normies,

02:15:49.080 --> 02:15:50.560
but it still doesn't work.

02:15:50.560 --> 02:15:52.560
You know, it still just falls apart.

02:15:53.600 --> 02:15:55.960
And, you know, the idea that, OK, you have a government

02:15:56.160 --> 02:16:00.400
and the government is going to legally mandate that all businesses be worker

02:16:00.400 --> 02:16:03.200
co-ops is the most basic form of market socialism, right?

02:16:03.600 --> 02:16:07.600
So that doesn't actually work, because like, how do you expand a business?

02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:10.520
Well, you don't because all the money is going to is being cut up,

02:16:10.520 --> 02:16:14.520
like all the profits just being being divided up and given to workers. Right.

02:16:14.800 --> 02:16:17.640
There's no extra profit to put into expansion of the business.

02:16:18.160 --> 02:16:19.000
You can take a loan out.

02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:22.600
OK, well, now the bank that you've loaned the money from,

02:16:22.920 --> 02:16:24.960
they're going to want interest on their loan.

02:16:24.960 --> 02:16:28.600
So now you're still going to be extracting some of the profit from the workers.

02:16:28.600 --> 02:16:30.800
But instead of giving it to an owner, you're giving it to a bank.

02:16:30.840 --> 02:16:35.560
Well, that bank in their argument would be a locally owned

02:16:35.560 --> 02:16:38.800
like co-op that is not based

02:16:39.400 --> 02:16:42.480
owned by either the government or by a private firm.

02:16:42.680 --> 02:16:46.440
It would be a co-op of people in the community

02:16:46.440 --> 02:16:49.600
that are looking to invest in a particular item.

02:16:50.200 --> 02:16:53.080
So interest really, it's still extractive, though.

02:16:53.120 --> 02:16:55.560
I mean, there's still the interest and it would still be extractive.

02:16:55.720 --> 02:16:57.320
It doesn't work. It doesn't work.

02:16:57.320 --> 02:16:59.000
Yeah, no, it's it's really dumb.

02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:01.920
And like the the market socialists that I've argued with

02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:05.440
since I've like moved into liberalism,

02:17:06.040 --> 02:17:10.120
it feels like they're just kind of recreating capitalism,

02:17:10.240 --> 02:17:14.240
but they don't want to call it capitalism and they don't want there to be like

02:17:14.800 --> 02:17:17.040
like an individual owning a company.

02:17:17.320 --> 02:17:19.440
And it's just a yeah. Yeah.

02:17:20.880 --> 02:17:25.360
So with with Trotsky, his his view was that something like

02:17:26.240 --> 02:17:28.080
a member of the working class

02:17:28.080 --> 02:17:31.640
who has managed to work his way up to the point that he owns his own business.

02:17:31.640 --> 02:17:34.880
He owns a small shop or he owns some kind of some kind of small business

02:17:34.880 --> 02:17:37.440
that he that he he owns it, but he also works in it.

02:17:37.440 --> 02:17:39.400
So he's both an owner and a laborer.

02:17:40.800 --> 02:17:44.560
This person will always side against a socialist revolution

02:17:44.560 --> 02:17:48.640
and therefore always with the fascists, because all non socialists

02:17:48.640 --> 02:17:50.960
are fascists in the end, you know how it is. But.

02:17:51.960 --> 02:17:56.200
But basically, this the small business owner, despite,

02:17:56.200 --> 02:17:59.560
you know, literally being a worker who owns the means of production,

02:17:59.920 --> 02:18:02.560
will always side against a socialist revolution

02:18:02.560 --> 02:18:06.600
because he has built the means of production with his own labor.

02:18:07.040 --> 02:18:11.360
And so he wants to keep the power structure in place that protects it

02:18:12.040 --> 02:18:14.560
rather than rather than being part of a revolution

02:18:14.560 --> 02:18:16.880
that seizes the means of production from someone else.

02:18:17.400 --> 02:18:21.680
So if you are someone who who creates your own stuff,

02:18:22.080 --> 02:18:26.000
there's always going to be, in Trotsky's view, an anti socialist streak in you

02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:27.640
and you're always going to be the enemy.

02:18:27.640 --> 02:18:30.800
And if you take that point of view to its natural conclusion,

02:18:31.040 --> 02:18:35.400
that literally means that all socialists have to be like

02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:38.320
literally the lowest common denominator of person.

02:18:38.520 --> 02:18:39.680
They can't be creative.

02:18:39.680 --> 02:18:41.720
They can't be hard working. They can't be innovative.

02:18:42.120 --> 02:18:45.160
They they just have to be the ones who sees

02:18:45.320 --> 02:18:47.680
what greater men have built.

02:18:47.680 --> 02:18:51.960
And it's like, well, I don't know if this is the line of logic

02:18:51.960 --> 02:18:54.720
you want to go down. It doesn't look very good. Yeah.

02:18:55.480 --> 02:18:59.200
Yeah. I remember on my way out of there, I

02:19:00.040 --> 02:19:02.680
he he won't watch anything on YouTube.

02:19:02.720 --> 02:19:05.280
My one of my old head mods.

02:19:05.280 --> 02:19:06.840
So F to Internet gas.

02:19:06.840 --> 02:19:12.200
But he lives in like Romania or some shit, some ex-Soviet state. And

02:19:13.200 --> 02:19:15.360
it I was like trying so hard.

02:19:15.360 --> 02:19:18.240
I remember like there was there was

02:19:19.480 --> 02:19:21.040
I can remember exactly what I was.

02:19:21.040 --> 02:19:23.960
We were playing fucking Half-Life two and we were watching

02:19:26.160 --> 02:19:29.360
documentaries about like Soviet style, like

02:19:30.600 --> 02:19:33.040
economics and like history.

02:19:33.200 --> 02:19:35.200
And I was like bending over backwards.

02:19:35.200 --> 02:19:37.840
And like when it was pointed out to me, I was bending over backwards

02:19:37.840 --> 02:19:41.840
to try and defend what was going on in Soviet Russia.

02:19:41.840 --> 02:19:43.640
I was like, oh, this is so fucked.

02:19:43.640 --> 02:19:45.000
Like, why am I doing this?

02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:46.920
I just I need to learn.

02:19:46.920 --> 02:19:48.240
And this is like one of the big lessons

02:19:48.240 --> 02:19:51.640
I've learned since I've started streaming, like learn to just like take an L

02:19:51.640 --> 02:19:55.760
and like figure out like when you're wrong and just like

02:19:55.760 --> 02:19:59.400
accept that you were wrong and then like fix your position accordingly.

02:19:59.720 --> 02:20:01.800
Right. Yeah. It's just.

02:20:02.960 --> 02:20:05.560
And there is there is an inverse less past that

02:20:06.400 --> 02:20:09.360
there's an inverse lesson, though, because my audience

02:20:09.600 --> 02:20:11.320
was way more right leaning than me.

02:20:11.320 --> 02:20:13.600
And for example, we disagree on whether or not

02:20:14.040 --> 02:20:16.520
the 2020 election was rigged or not. Right. Right.

02:20:16.880 --> 02:20:18.880
They they tend to think that it was.

02:20:18.880 --> 02:20:20.840
I don't think that it was.

02:20:20.840 --> 02:20:24.960
However, the issue is, is that if we're going just by like

02:20:25.400 --> 02:20:29.280
popularity and feedback, I should be taking an L from them.

02:20:29.280 --> 02:20:30.320
But I don't. All right.

02:20:30.320 --> 02:20:31.800
I don't I don't give them that one.

02:20:31.800 --> 02:20:35.480
I say, even though there's not be 500 of you in my stream

02:20:35.480 --> 02:20:38.400
chat saying that I'm wrong, I'll be like, no, I think I'm correct on this one.

02:20:38.720 --> 02:20:40.560
So sometimes you also have to learn

02:20:40.560 --> 02:20:45.680
when to go against the popular criticism of you and say, hold on.

02:20:45.680 --> 02:20:48.520
I don't think that even though it's popular, I don't think it's correct.

02:20:48.800 --> 02:20:51.320
That's that's like something something that streamers also have to learn, too.

02:20:51.640 --> 02:20:54.440
Yeah, no, for sure. And that was

02:20:54.440 --> 02:20:56.560
someone asked how many of my friends have I lost since,

02:20:57.080 --> 02:20:58.880
like, stop being a socialist.

02:20:58.880 --> 02:21:03.280
It's like I probably like 90 percent of the people that I used to talk to

02:21:03.280 --> 02:21:07.960
or were friends with, I'm no longer have contact with

02:21:07.960 --> 02:21:12.440
because it's either a really bad optically for them to have me on stream

02:21:12.440 --> 02:21:15.600
and like shitpost around because I've gotten to so many arguments

02:21:15.600 --> 02:21:20.000
with lefties online and like the the more arguments I get into

02:21:20.320 --> 02:21:24.160
with these people, like the the meaner I get, because it just

02:21:24.400 --> 02:21:27.640
I get frustrated and say meaner and meaner things.

02:21:27.840 --> 02:21:31.600
But like I've probably lost like 90 percent of my professional contacts

02:21:31.600 --> 02:21:35.360
over the course of like streaming because of like.

02:21:36.360 --> 02:21:37.880
Just who have you lost?

02:21:37.880 --> 02:21:39.080
Like what's that?

02:21:39.080 --> 02:21:42.480
I like I think me and shark three or zero are still cool,

02:21:42.480 --> 02:21:45.120
but like I don't really like talk to him very much anymore,

02:21:45.120 --> 02:21:46.520
even though like we used to be on each other's streams,

02:21:46.520 --> 02:21:48.680
like almost all the fucking time.

02:21:48.680 --> 02:21:52.280
A lot of people who have like dropped off and like stop streaming.

02:21:53.560 --> 02:21:56.600
There is this one guy named Growl God.

02:21:56.600 --> 02:22:00.000
I used to like be in the like Vasht sphere

02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:02.120
and Vasht had come on my stream a couple of times

02:22:02.120 --> 02:22:09.120
and like the like all the like smaller orbiters around that,

02:22:09.320 --> 02:22:12.120
like demon mama and doe and people like that.

02:22:13.120 --> 02:22:15.040
Who are the fucking insaneoids?

02:22:15.040 --> 02:22:18.200
Yeah. Who I tried to like be like ultra charitable to,

02:22:18.200 --> 02:22:20.600
even though like their position was completely untenable.

02:22:21.240 --> 02:22:24.080
And like the second that you go against them, like it's like

02:22:24.080 --> 02:22:26.920
you're literally a fascist now and you need to die.

02:22:27.920 --> 02:22:31.720
So like most of the people like surrounding Vasht

02:22:31.720 --> 02:22:34.600
are like the people that I had professional contact with

02:22:34.600 --> 02:22:39.160
and like friendships with and like lost almost all of that,

02:22:39.160 --> 02:22:44.600
like possible growth from the lefty crowd there, because just

02:22:45.960 --> 02:22:48.880
either because like I've had a public disagreement with them

02:22:49.040 --> 02:22:55.080
or because it's just like so like in terms of like Vasht viewers

02:22:55.080 --> 02:22:59.000
and like people in the space that at least somewhat agree with Vasht.

02:22:59.200 --> 02:23:03.120
It's like I'm radioactive because I,

02:23:04.720 --> 02:23:06.320
you know, argued with them too much.

02:23:06.320 --> 02:23:09.120
And they also tried to say that I was a destiny orbiter

02:23:09.120 --> 02:23:12.960
before like I actually ever engaged with him, literally ever.

02:23:13.240 --> 02:23:15.640
So like like that, Vasht does that.

02:23:15.760 --> 02:23:18.640
He does that. He's like, these are destiny style arguments.

02:23:18.680 --> 02:23:20.160
Is he feeding you information?

02:23:20.160 --> 02:23:23.160
Oh, God, that shit is so fucking funny.

02:23:23.480 --> 02:23:24.760
Oh, God. Yeah.

02:23:24.760 --> 02:23:28.520
And see, like like Rosarest is like the last person that you could do that to,

02:23:28.520 --> 02:23:32.880
because he's still like, you know, he I'm pretty sure he is still a socialist.

02:23:32.880 --> 02:23:35.960
Right. But he's just like a there was a sock to him.

02:23:36.840 --> 02:23:38.400
Maybe is a sock to him. I don't know.

02:23:38.400 --> 02:23:41.440
He's made really good arguments for like market socialism

02:23:42.440 --> 02:23:45.960
that like if I were to get into an argument with him about market socialism,

02:23:46.280 --> 02:23:49.400
he would probably crush me just because he knows more about the topic

02:23:49.400 --> 02:23:51.480
of like economics than I do. But.

02:23:53.960 --> 02:23:55.680
Vasht would be nothing like that. Oh, yeah, of course.

02:23:55.680 --> 02:23:59.400
But yeah, I remember like I was like simultaneously

02:23:59.400 --> 02:24:02.920
I was like in this like Venn diagram, like right in the middle

02:24:02.920 --> 02:24:05.120
between like Vasht and destiny viewers.

02:24:05.120 --> 02:24:07.880
But like the second that I started like arguing with people on the left

02:24:07.880 --> 02:24:10.560
for like doing like increasingly fucking crazy things.

02:24:11.240 --> 02:24:13.040
It was just like it was all over.

02:24:13.040 --> 02:24:16.160
Like there was no coming back.

02:24:16.160 --> 02:24:16.960
Like the. Yeah.

02:24:16.960 --> 02:24:19.040
They also just lean into being an orbiter now.

02:24:19.040 --> 02:24:23.640
Just oh, yeah, no, I definitely I have I have leaned into that shit so hard.

02:24:24.480 --> 02:24:28.960
I used to lean into it like way harder back when I was like extra mad

02:24:28.960 --> 02:24:32.960
at the lefties, like like dog piling me

02:24:33.200 --> 02:24:37.120
like the the destiny and couples drama like.

02:24:38.760 --> 02:24:41.160
Oh, my God, couples is a fucking nightmare.

02:24:41.200 --> 02:24:43.720
Yeah, she is so happy she's gone.

02:24:43.960 --> 02:24:46.920
I'm so happy she's dropped off hardcore, although she got a W

02:24:46.920 --> 02:24:50.760
against the poly people person the other day with the Finster drama.

02:24:50.760 --> 02:24:56.640
But I like the the preamble to that started

02:24:56.640 --> 02:25:01.520
because I called out demon mama for like calling destiny like

02:25:02.880 --> 02:25:05.200
or like saying that destiny was hate rating couples.

02:25:05.400 --> 02:25:07.600
And I was like, wait, is there evidence of that?

02:25:07.600 --> 02:25:09.520
And she's like, I don't need to give you evidence.

02:25:09.520 --> 02:25:12.920
So then I like went through and like with the help of like people in my chat

02:25:12.920 --> 02:25:16.320
and like found like all like the screen caps of like

02:25:16.800 --> 02:25:19.920
the like when clips were made of when hate rates were happening

02:25:20.080 --> 02:25:22.360
versus what destiny was doing simultaneously.

02:25:22.360 --> 02:25:25.200
He was like in a in a debate with someone or like playing

02:25:26.280 --> 02:25:28.600
not Dark Souls, the other one, the the more recent one.

02:25:29.120 --> 02:25:33.920
Yeah. And like because I posted that, I got like

02:25:33.920 --> 02:25:36.880
that was probably like the worst fucking hate I've gotten online.

02:25:36.880 --> 02:25:39.520
Holy fucking shit.

02:25:39.520 --> 02:25:41.040
And I wasn't even like home.

02:25:41.040 --> 02:25:44.280
I was like out of state, like visiting my girlfriend's family.

02:25:44.480 --> 02:25:48.520
And it was it was just like really fucking that.

02:25:48.520 --> 02:25:51.320
That's why I like every single

02:25:52.600 --> 02:25:55.400
thing to do with like destiny and couples or destiny.

02:25:55.400 --> 02:25:58.600
And demon mama like since then has like my name has come up

02:25:58.600 --> 02:26:01.680
because the whole like thing started with me

02:26:02.480 --> 02:26:07.560
like going ultra hard on demon mama because she questioned me.

02:26:08.400 --> 02:26:11.400
You know, and

02:26:11.400 --> 02:26:15.440
if you're too radioactive for these people, I definitely am.

02:26:15.680 --> 02:26:18.760
If if they even know who I am, I'm still like reasonably small, right?

02:26:18.760 --> 02:26:19.520
I'm not a huge channel.

02:26:19.520 --> 02:26:21.600
I'm not I'm not I'm not small, but I'm not huge. Right.

02:26:24.200 --> 02:26:29.840
I know at one point, Zandra Hall was pushing very hard to debate me there,

02:26:29.840 --> 02:26:34.840
and I eventually I eventually I'm not much of a debater. Right.

02:26:35.080 --> 02:26:37.440
But I eventually accepted that he vanished.

02:26:37.440 --> 02:26:39.600
I think he didn't want to actually do it.

02:26:39.600 --> 02:26:42.720
And also, I managed to get like Sargon to debate.

02:26:42.720 --> 02:26:43.440
I was like Sargon.

02:26:43.480 --> 02:26:44.960
Hey, then I'll say some things about you.

02:26:44.960 --> 02:26:45.760
Do you want to debate?

02:26:45.760 --> 02:26:47.200
Do you want to debate?

02:26:47.200 --> 02:26:50.080
And so I was like, I'm such an Adam, right?

02:26:51.240 --> 02:26:53.440
No, Chud Logic was going to host it. Oh, shit.

02:26:53.480 --> 02:26:58.000
So Chud Logic was going to was going to moderate between Zandra Hall and Sargon.

02:26:58.440 --> 02:27:00.480
And Chud was down and Chud was trying to set it up.

02:27:00.800 --> 02:27:04.160
And at the same time, Zandra Hall wanted to debate me.

02:27:04.160 --> 02:27:05.440
And I was like, OK, fine.

02:27:05.440 --> 02:27:08.160
And then he just ghosted all of us.

02:27:08.160 --> 02:27:10.400
He just vanished.

02:27:10.400 --> 02:27:12.840
And now he acts like it never fucking happened.

02:27:13.440 --> 02:27:16.040
Yeah. The only time I ever interacted with Zandra Hall, he

02:27:17.320 --> 02:27:21.080
I was talking with Zandra Hall, Shark Three of Zero and Merrick.

02:27:21.280 --> 02:27:24.760
And Zandra Hall just like told a story about him, like coming in his own shorts

02:27:24.760 --> 02:27:29.040
all the time as a teenager because he didn't want to like get caught masturbating.

02:27:29.040 --> 02:27:31.440
And he just like wallowed in the cum.

02:27:31.680 --> 02:27:33.920
And so like, that's the only interaction I've ever had with him.

02:27:33.920 --> 02:27:37.160
So was that on stream or? Yes, it was on stream.

02:27:37.320 --> 02:27:41.920
It was hellish, actually, like him telling the story because it was it was so

02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:45.560
there was so much detail about how the kind of just laid on his leg.

02:27:45.560 --> 02:27:47.640
And it was like it went on for way too long.

02:27:47.640 --> 02:27:52.800
And I was like, you don't want to be telling the story. OK, but yeah.

02:27:53.280 --> 02:27:57.600
Merrick is somebody else that I've been like kind of friendly with over the years,

02:27:57.600 --> 02:27:59.440
but not really, not anymore.

02:27:59.440 --> 02:28:00.560
That's kind of kind of ended.

02:28:00.560 --> 02:28:03.080
I think that's what happened with me, because I like

02:28:04.640 --> 02:28:08.160
there was like, you know, the better discourse debates that Destiny's gone on.

02:28:08.200 --> 02:28:11.680
He like argued with the Nico House guy.

02:28:11.960 --> 02:28:15.480
About like Google owning everything.

02:28:15.480 --> 02:28:17.360
I don't think I know this one. No, no.

02:28:17.360 --> 02:28:19.000
It's like an event that happens in Dallas.

02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:22.560
And I had gone to that in me, a shark, zero shark

02:28:23.960 --> 02:28:27.560
socialism done left in Merrick, all roomed in an Airbnb together.

02:28:27.720 --> 02:28:30.400
So I really like and I really like Merrick. Right.

02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:33.840
And there were like really, really great people in person.

02:28:34.040 --> 02:28:38.600
But like the online like discourse with these people are not still

02:28:38.600 --> 02:28:40.960
SEO is like really, really chill.

02:28:40.960 --> 02:28:47.520
But Merrick is online is way different than Merrick IRL.

02:28:48.360 --> 02:28:51.600
Both of their policy prescriptions seem to be fucking insane.

02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:55.320
Like nothing about how cool they are as people, but like their ideas.

02:28:55.320 --> 02:28:56.960
Yeah, that's for both of them.

02:28:56.960 --> 02:28:59.800
Like they're just holy fuck.

02:29:00.360 --> 02:29:05.720
With Merrick, the last time I talked to her, I was basically I was steel

02:29:05.720 --> 02:29:11.200
manning Destiny's position of replatforming Nick Fuentes, saying, listen.

02:29:12.520 --> 02:29:15.800
Regardless, the point that Destiny seemed to be making was that,

02:29:15.800 --> 02:29:19.440
one, it had been a long time, he didn't know if Nick Fuentes was was so extreme.

02:29:19.680 --> 02:29:21.360
He was like 18 back in the day.

02:29:21.360 --> 02:29:23.440
Now he's like 24 people's opinions change.

02:29:23.440 --> 02:29:24.760
That's a long time.

02:29:24.760 --> 02:29:28.640
And in a in a especially transformative period of your life,

02:29:28.840 --> 02:29:30.760
maybe he's not as extreme as he used to be.

02:29:30.760 --> 02:29:33.080
And two, I think this was the better argument.

02:29:34.080 --> 02:29:38.720
Is that. It doesn't matter if Nick Fuentes is a fascist

02:29:38.720 --> 02:29:41.440
or some other kind of, you know, insane ideology,

02:29:41.760 --> 02:29:43.920
because the conversations are more interesting.

02:29:43.960 --> 02:29:47.960
Nobody is talking about this stuff, so let's talk about the actual ideas

02:29:47.960 --> 02:29:50.920
and forget about like, OK, you're a fascist, therefore you're evil, you know?

02:29:51.440 --> 02:29:54.840
And I think those are actually two pretty good, pretty good reasons

02:29:54.840 --> 02:29:57.840
as to why Destiny should have kept talking to Nick Fuentes

02:29:57.840 --> 02:29:59.960
or at least should have started talking to him again.

02:30:00.200 --> 02:30:01.400
Like that's fine.

02:30:01.440 --> 02:30:02.360
I don't think like.

02:30:02.360 --> 02:30:05.880
But she was going, no, Nick Fuentes is way too smart for Destiny.

02:30:05.960 --> 02:30:07.840
He's way too smart for you.

02:30:07.840 --> 02:30:11.440
He's going to fucking he's going to like convert everyone's audience

02:30:11.440 --> 02:30:13.000
and you're all too stupid to know it.

02:30:13.000 --> 02:30:14.640
And I was like, Merrick.

02:30:14.920 --> 02:30:17.600
Is he is he too smart for you?

02:30:18.080 --> 02:30:21.440
And she was like, no, no, I'm the only one who could outthink him.

02:30:21.600 --> 02:30:22.720
And I'm like, why don't you talk to him?

02:30:22.720 --> 02:30:25.760
Then, you know, and she like she just took off after that.

02:30:25.760 --> 02:30:27.400
She wouldn't she wouldn't reply to that, right?

02:30:27.400 --> 02:30:29.840
Yeah, I feel like.

02:30:30.520 --> 02:30:34.400
There were there were some like critiques, like I felt like the like getting

02:30:34.680 --> 02:30:38.040
getting dinner and like streaming that with Fuentes was like weird.

02:30:38.040 --> 02:30:39.760
But like, I don't think I can tell.

02:30:39.760 --> 02:30:42.960
Yeah, I don't feel like I can tell people who they can and can't

02:30:43.000 --> 02:30:45.920
like do content with, so like I never really.

02:30:49.040 --> 02:30:50.560
You know, I never really like went hard

02:30:50.560 --> 02:30:53.000
into like saying Destiny should or shouldn't be

02:30:54.320 --> 02:30:56.920
talking to him, you know,

02:30:56.920 --> 02:31:00.240
but I, I have a good answer for that.

02:31:00.240 --> 02:31:02.280
I have a really good answer for that.

02:31:02.280 --> 02:31:07.560
I don't view it as my obligation to actually make the world better.

02:31:08.480 --> 02:31:11.720
It'd be good if I did, but I'm not required to.

02:31:11.720 --> 02:31:14.640
If I want to chill and hang out with someone who,

02:31:14.920 --> 02:31:18.560
you know, even though he has really strange radical politics

02:31:18.800 --> 02:31:20.960
in a nonpolitical way, he's a nice guy.

02:31:20.960 --> 02:31:22.200
If I want to do that, I can do that.

02:31:22.200 --> 02:31:23.800
You know, I can fucking do that.

02:31:23.800 --> 02:31:26.680
I am under no obligation to platform anyone

02:31:26.840 --> 02:31:30.880
or not platform anyone based on anybody else's moral intuitions.

02:31:30.880 --> 02:31:33.040
I don't care about any of that shit.

02:31:33.040 --> 02:31:35.400
The whole shouldn't you use your platform to be more?

02:31:35.520 --> 02:31:38.200
No, I shouldn't. No, absolutely not.

02:31:38.560 --> 02:31:39.720
I completely reject that logic.

02:31:41.520 --> 02:31:44.280
Yeah, I don't like necessarily disagree.

02:31:44.280 --> 02:31:47.400
Vash would call that super augatory.

02:31:47.400 --> 02:31:49.640
But the God

02:31:49.640 --> 02:31:52.040
I feel like when it comes to Fuentes,

02:31:52.040 --> 02:31:55.400
I lost so much respect for him, like intellectually.

02:31:55.400 --> 02:31:58.000
Like he used to be like a really scary person

02:31:59.240 --> 02:32:02.080
just like because it was like ideology and shit, because like it's

02:32:02.680 --> 02:32:05.320
like I do find like the

02:32:05.320 --> 02:32:09.320
this might be a brave take, but I find like the Nazi stuff to be really disgusting.

02:32:10.160 --> 02:32:12.280
But like a good job.

02:32:12.280 --> 02:32:16.920
Yeah, good job with all the Kino casino fucking like cat boy

02:32:16.920 --> 02:32:20.840
come hunting shit that he did with the America first people.

02:32:21.040 --> 02:32:23.240
He's just like a fucking goon.

02:32:23.240 --> 02:32:25.520
I'm not really I don't really see him as like a

02:32:26.480 --> 02:32:28.920
super like spooky person as much anymore, you know?

02:32:30.480 --> 02:32:32.720
Yeah, yeah, I completely agree with you.

02:32:32.760 --> 02:32:34.560
I completely agree with you.

02:32:35.720 --> 02:32:38.000
And if we're talking about like actual,

02:32:38.320 --> 02:32:41.480
you know, influential right wing figures,

02:32:41.480 --> 02:32:43.960
I mean, Nick Fuentes is very influential, especially in the United States. Right.

02:32:44.480 --> 02:32:47.800
But he's he's running a political movement

02:32:47.800 --> 02:32:51.000
that will probably fizzle out as he as he gets older. Right.

02:32:51.360 --> 02:32:55.080
It's already gone through several iterations over the course of his online career.

02:32:56.560 --> 02:33:01.520
You know, the epochs of people's life tend to not last more than a decade.

02:33:01.920 --> 02:33:04.200
He'll probably be doing something different in 10 years. Right.

02:33:04.520 --> 02:33:07.120
We all probably will be.

02:33:08.200 --> 02:33:12.800
I'd be super curious to see what like a 30 year old Nick Fuentes is doing,

02:33:12.800 --> 02:33:15.720
like given how fucking radioactive he is. But

02:33:16.720 --> 02:33:17.920
I know I know what you mean.

02:33:17.920 --> 02:33:21.960
Maybe he might he might like morph into an Alex Jones Rush

02:33:21.960 --> 02:33:24.000
Limbaugh kind of a person where he does like radio instead.

02:33:24.560 --> 02:33:25.520
He kind of does that now.

02:33:25.520 --> 02:33:28.240
But he also does like real life activism, you know, but he might like

02:33:28.240 --> 02:33:30.640
he might try to try to try to parlay that into some sort of a show,

02:33:31.200 --> 02:33:33.360
like a grander scale show.

02:33:33.360 --> 02:33:36.960
I do think his numbers are probably kind of inflated over on cozy. Oh, 100%.

02:33:38.680 --> 02:33:42.320
But but no, like, have you have you heard about the act

02:33:42.320 --> 02:33:44.920
like the whole academic agent present Sunday thing?

02:33:46.600 --> 02:33:48.760
I don't know. Oh, wait.

02:33:49.480 --> 02:33:51.600
I vaguely know about this.

02:33:51.800 --> 02:33:55.360
He present Sunday before he like got big into like streaming.

02:33:55.360 --> 02:33:59.400
He like doxed in, contacted academic agents

02:33:59.880 --> 02:34:02.400
workplace, right, and got him fired. Yes.

02:34:02.880 --> 02:34:08.600
He was a university professor in the UK and he got him fired. Jesus.

02:34:09.400 --> 02:34:14.320
Yeah. And now here's here's what he got him fired for.

02:34:14.880 --> 02:34:18.920
Academic agent was like your generic anti SJW YouTuber. Yeah. All right.

02:34:19.440 --> 02:34:21.560
And the UK is pretty extreme when it comes to stuff

02:34:21.560 --> 02:34:24.360
like this compared to compared to North America.

02:34:24.720 --> 02:34:29.520
So he lost his job for daring to make fun of the SJWs in 2014.

02:34:30.760 --> 02:34:34.920
And he this guy, he's like a university professor and he's he's pretty well

02:34:34.920 --> 02:34:36.480
educated, he's pretty well read.

02:34:36.480 --> 02:34:38.040
He's he's very sharp.

02:34:38.040 --> 02:34:41.800
You don't want to debate him, even though I don't think he's correct generally.

02:34:42.160 --> 02:34:46.440
But I do respect him and I do like I have his his his latest book.

02:34:46.920 --> 02:34:51.480
That's something I'll probably be tackling soon, maybe depending on my time. But.

02:34:53.240 --> 02:34:56.520
Even though I don't agree with him, I respect him because he's somebody

02:34:56.520 --> 02:34:59.480
who is well read and he's well educated and he can he can write.

02:34:59.480 --> 02:35:01.680
He can think he can speak.

02:35:01.680 --> 02:35:05.240
And so this guy who is probably like a very generic conservative

02:35:05.560 --> 02:35:09.960
or he was back in the day now, he's he after after losing his job

02:35:09.960 --> 02:35:12.600
and having to like scrabble together enough money to survive

02:35:12.960 --> 02:35:15.600
and, you know, being being treated by the system

02:35:15.600 --> 02:35:17.800
that he views as being a left leaning system.

02:35:17.800 --> 02:35:22.400
He's he's like a full, hardcore neo reactionary. Right. Right.

02:35:22.400 --> 02:35:25.600
And now he's writing now he's writing political theory for the neo

02:35:25.600 --> 02:35:29.720
reactionary camp, you know, and it's like Jesus. All right.

02:35:30.360 --> 02:35:34.120
I don't know what you necessarily accomplished by getting this guy canceled

02:35:34.120 --> 02:35:36.160
other than radicalizing him.

02:35:36.160 --> 02:35:38.680
And he's also capable of of of writing,

02:35:39.080 --> 02:35:41.840
you know, scathing political theory for your enemies.

02:35:41.840 --> 02:35:44.720
So you've you've made things worse President Sunday.

02:35:44.760 --> 02:35:48.120
I feel like it's the obvious like conclusion.

02:35:48.120 --> 02:35:51.640
If you're going to like drive people out of like the like general

02:35:51.640 --> 02:35:54.640
like spaces where everybody talks,

02:35:54.640 --> 02:35:57.080
then you're going to push them into like spaces

02:35:57.080 --> 02:36:01.760
where only like certain opinions are are accepted. Right.

02:36:01.920 --> 02:36:05.280
And even if that person is like relatively like center,

02:36:05.560 --> 02:36:09.400
like, you know, center leaning towards their politics,

02:36:09.400 --> 02:36:11.520
maybe they're a little bit rightly, maybe they're a little bit leftly,

02:36:11.520 --> 02:36:13.680
but they're relatively centrist. Right.

02:36:13.680 --> 02:36:17.320
If you if you push it to where they only ever get to interact with people

02:36:17.320 --> 02:36:20.280
that are like super far left or super far right, then

02:36:21.200 --> 02:36:23.880
where do you think their positions are going to end up? You know?

02:36:25.320 --> 02:36:27.480
Yeah, it's and it's not just that.

02:36:27.480 --> 02:36:33.080
It's also I think academic agent really took like he got down.

02:36:33.400 --> 02:36:37.040
Like you got like trampled by the system after he got fired

02:36:37.400 --> 02:36:40.360
and he viewed it as a left leaning system, and that was a lot of it, too.

02:36:40.640 --> 02:36:42.880
It's like so there's there's this theory on the right.

02:36:43.280 --> 02:36:45.400
And I think it holds some some weight.

02:36:45.400 --> 02:36:48.720
And it's this it's basically they call it

02:36:50.080 --> 02:36:52.520
the best way to describe it is tyranny by red tape.

02:36:53.440 --> 02:36:56.920
So the idea is that government can become so big

02:36:56.920 --> 02:36:59.520
and so bloated and so bureaucratic

02:37:00.120 --> 02:37:04.720
that you never even know when you're doing something wrong.

02:37:04.720 --> 02:37:08.120
You know, the the common stereotype is if you walk down to the store,

02:37:08.120 --> 02:37:10.200
you can violate a dozen laws and not even know it.

02:37:10.200 --> 02:37:12.320
You know, you hear that story a lot. Yeah, for sure. And.

02:37:13.320 --> 02:37:18.360
And the idea basically is a government that is that expansive can therefore

02:37:18.680 --> 02:37:23.400
choose when to enforce a law and when not to enforce a law.

02:37:23.760 --> 02:37:26.360
So you never know if you're if you're in trouble.

02:37:26.640 --> 02:37:28.560
You never know if you're not in trouble.

02:37:28.560 --> 02:37:32.720
And it might just be the whims of the people involved that you are in trouble,

02:37:32.720 --> 02:37:35.280
you know, because maybe you could jaywalk and then get hit with a fine

02:37:35.280 --> 02:37:37.480
and then the next day do it and then knock it up to get it with a fine,

02:37:37.680 --> 02:37:42.760
depending on who's around what if the officer there likes you, if he doesn't.

02:37:42.960 --> 02:37:47.360
So the way that society is currently structured, according to this view,

02:37:47.360 --> 02:37:52.160
that's pretty common on the right right now, is that it's so it's so expansive

02:37:52.360 --> 02:37:56.840
and also there's not enough resources to implement all of it at all times.

02:37:57.080 --> 02:37:59.760
So it becomes necessarily arbitrary.

02:38:00.080 --> 02:38:07.080
So it's it's it's something like a narco tyranny, if that makes sense. Yeah. Yeah.

02:38:07.160 --> 02:38:10.040
And yeah, it is kind of related to to Franz Kafka's

02:38:10.640 --> 02:38:14.960
Kafka, Kafka esque work, you know, the idea that you have these big

02:38:14.960 --> 02:38:18.440
impersonal bureaucracies that just kind of crush you and there's nothing

02:38:18.440 --> 02:38:21.440
you can do about it because there's no actual person to talk to, you know,

02:38:21.600 --> 02:38:25.240
that like you hear this a lot when you complain, if you call up a business

02:38:25.240 --> 02:38:28.040
and you only get like a phone message and there's no actual real person

02:38:28.040 --> 02:38:30.680
to discuss or things like get a person.

02:38:30.680 --> 02:38:32.200
They say, well, this isn't my department.

02:38:32.200 --> 02:38:33.320
Talk to this person.

02:38:33.320 --> 02:38:36.040
They say this is my department. They sit you off somewhere else.

02:38:36.600 --> 02:38:38.400
Or this is my this is just store policy.

02:38:38.400 --> 02:38:39.360
We can't do anything about it.

02:38:39.360 --> 02:38:42.680
Like when you've hit a stone wall where it seems like

02:38:42.680 --> 02:38:45.600
there's no actual way that being reasonable can help you.

02:38:45.920 --> 02:38:48.320
You know, this this this is the tyranny of red tape.

02:38:50.160 --> 02:38:54.480
And right wing people who talk about this, they pin a lot of it on the left

02:38:54.640 --> 02:38:56.120
because someone in the chat mentions H.R.

02:38:56.120 --> 02:38:57.120
departments, H.R.

02:38:57.120 --> 02:39:00.160
departments are overwhelmingly run by left leaning people.

02:39:00.400 --> 02:39:02.640
You know, a lot a lot of these standards are

02:39:03.120 --> 02:39:05.840
overwhelmingly implemented by left leaning people in government.

02:39:06.160 --> 02:39:09.520
So the right views the tyranny of red tape

02:39:09.520 --> 02:39:12.480
as being a natural byproduct of leftist policy.

02:39:13.360 --> 02:39:16.760
Yeah, I've heard a lot of like right wing critiques of the right wing

02:39:16.760 --> 02:39:20.520
saying that they they kind of ceded so much cultural ground

02:39:20.520 --> 02:39:23.640
to the to the left in so many different areas, whether it's

02:39:24.240 --> 02:39:26.800
bureaucracy or whether it's,

02:39:26.800 --> 02:39:29.360
you know, like everyone went into like financial systems

02:39:29.360 --> 02:39:33.000
or into oil or some shit like that on the right that they built out

02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:34.360
all these things there.

02:39:34.360 --> 02:39:38.560
But like when it came to like Hollywood or when it came to like online stuff

02:39:38.560 --> 02:39:40.520
or when it came to,

02:39:40.520 --> 02:39:42.120
like you're saying, like H.R.

02:39:42.120 --> 02:39:46.760
like psychology or basically anything there, philosophy, academia,

02:39:47.920 --> 02:39:51.640
because they didn't like build out anybody like going into these areas

02:39:51.640 --> 02:39:53.160
because they weren't seen as important.

02:39:53.160 --> 02:39:56.600
Now it's all dominated by the left and it's really hard to get a foothold

02:39:56.600 --> 02:40:00.520
because there's so much like a social pressure and like

02:40:01.040 --> 02:40:08.040
inter like profession pressure to be within that head space

02:40:08.040 --> 02:40:12.760
or like political space that like people that are right wing in those areas

02:40:12.760 --> 02:40:15.760
end up like burning out or like just,

02:40:16.680 --> 02:40:18.720
you know, not going into it at all, you know?

02:40:19.680 --> 02:40:23.040
Yeah. And there's actually also an inverse effect, too.

02:40:23.480 --> 02:40:26.680
And here's a great way so I can describe it. So.

02:40:29.480 --> 02:40:32.040
If you want to become, hold on,

02:40:32.480 --> 02:40:35.800
maybe I can find the video so I can show you exactly what I mean, OK?

02:40:37.680 --> 02:40:38.880
Give me just a second.

02:40:38.880 --> 02:40:41.680
After this video, I'm probably going to have to log off, by the way.

02:40:41.880 --> 02:40:42.840
I've been streaming for all my time.

02:40:42.840 --> 02:40:45.520
I mean, it's it's it is it is 10 p.m. for me.

02:40:45.520 --> 02:40:48.320
I'll have to go in a few minutes, too.

02:40:49.800 --> 02:40:52.120
OK, so I'll give you a video,

02:40:52.120 --> 02:40:55.120
I'll give you the explanation of the theory, and then we can we can call it.

02:40:55.520 --> 02:40:57.800
All right. It's a minute long. So just check this out. All right.

02:41:02.040 --> 02:41:04.280
OK, so check out what this guy is doing, right?

02:41:04.280 --> 02:41:06.360
I think this is the correct. Yes, it is. This is the correct video.

02:41:06.800 --> 02:41:11.960
So this is a guy who's been a professional drywaller for 30 years,

02:41:11.960 --> 02:41:16.280
and he's specialized exclusively in how to put up drywall

02:41:16.600 --> 02:41:19.040
and like look at how he does his work right.

02:41:19.280 --> 02:41:20.760
He doesn't need to measure.

02:41:20.760 --> 02:41:22.640
He just he knows exactly where to cut.

02:41:22.640 --> 02:41:24.240
You know exactly how to cut.

02:41:24.240 --> 02:41:26.440
You can put in nails in one hammer.

02:41:26.640 --> 02:41:28.640
You can slice these sheets, no problem.

02:41:28.640 --> 02:41:31.840
Like this is this is like an unparalleled level of skill.

02:41:31.960 --> 02:41:34.160
Yeah. Right. To do the to do the job like this.

02:41:35.640 --> 02:41:37.960
And the thing is,

02:41:37.960 --> 02:41:43.120
is that you can't learn this type of skill by reading a book on drywall.

02:41:43.640 --> 02:41:46.320
It doesn't matter how many books on drywall that you read,

02:41:46.320 --> 02:41:48.400
you'll never become as skilled solely by reading books.

02:41:48.640 --> 02:41:51.280
Reading can help, but you have to do it

02:41:52.120 --> 02:41:54.320
to become this good at something, right?

02:41:54.320 --> 02:41:57.520
So there's a conservative political philosopher.

02:41:57.880 --> 02:42:00.760
There's I think it's Michael Oakshot.

02:42:00.760 --> 02:42:03.600
I think that's his name, Michael Oakshot.

02:42:05.120 --> 02:42:07.800
Yes, Michael Oakshot, and he had a theory

02:42:08.360 --> 02:42:15.000
and his theory is that knowledge can be split into two different things.

02:42:15.560 --> 02:42:18.080
So you have intellectual knowledge,

02:42:18.080 --> 02:42:22.320
which is the rational knowledge, reasonable knowledge, minded knowledge.

02:42:22.640 --> 02:42:24.160
This is the stuff that you can write down.

02:42:24.160 --> 02:42:25.760
This is theory. All right.

02:42:25.760 --> 02:42:28.480
And then you have embodied knowledge.

02:42:29.040 --> 02:42:33.160
And that is what you learn by actively practicing and doing a thing.

02:42:33.480 --> 02:42:37.040
And you can't express embodied knowledge through theory.

02:42:38.080 --> 02:42:41.160
So this is and this is something that, in his opinion,

02:42:41.360 --> 02:42:44.080
the left has completely abandoned.

02:42:45.080 --> 02:42:48.320
Is the practice of these sorts of things and getting knowledge

02:42:48.320 --> 02:42:51.880
through doing rather than through academic means.

02:42:51.880 --> 02:42:56.160
Yeah. And so, you know, you have a lot of leftists who who think that studying

02:42:56.160 --> 02:43:00.920
should be very academic and and a lot of writing, a lot of theorizing,

02:43:00.920 --> 02:43:04.520
a lot of thinking and almost no actual practice. That's that's why.

02:43:04.640 --> 02:43:07.120
And in fact, you can see this in some of the conversations they have.

02:43:07.360 --> 02:43:10.240
They'll say, well, that didn't that, you know, that wasn't real socialism.

02:43:10.240 --> 02:43:12.120
Well, why not? Well, this is what Marx actually wrote.

02:43:12.120 --> 02:43:13.080
It's like, well, hold on.

02:43:13.080 --> 02:43:16.120
You can't rely on the theory if the practice is different, right?

02:43:16.120 --> 02:43:19.000
They completely abandon the practice part of the thing.

02:43:19.360 --> 02:43:22.480
Yes. So in the chat says you can't get better motor skills by reading theory.

02:43:22.480 --> 02:43:24.920
Exactly. It's still a form of knowledge.

02:43:24.920 --> 02:43:27.320
It's still stored in your brain like knowledges,

02:43:27.800 --> 02:43:31.520
but it can't be accessed through rationalistic means.

02:43:31.760 --> 02:43:34.600
It's more intuition than reason.

02:43:34.600 --> 02:43:37.800
And fuck, I wish I saved the clip.

02:43:37.800 --> 02:43:38.720
There was a clip there.

02:43:38.720 --> 02:43:42.080
I tuned into one of his streams at one point, and he said something like,

02:43:42.440 --> 02:43:47.480
Intuitional thinking is is the the foundation of fascist thinking.

02:43:47.680 --> 02:43:51.400
And if you and if you ever go off your intuition, ever, you're a fascist

02:43:51.400 --> 02:43:53.440
or like or you're leading into fascist territory.

02:43:53.440 --> 02:43:55.640
And it's like, holy fuck, dude.

02:43:55.640 --> 02:43:58.640
That plays into the fascist talking point that like, like,

02:43:59.240 --> 02:44:01.400
fuck, it's been so long since I've like

02:44:02.520 --> 02:44:05.880
read Genteelay, but

02:44:05.880 --> 02:44:09.600
they they really hate people that like learn for the sake of learning.

02:44:09.600 --> 02:44:12.080
They want they want men of action to like go out there.

02:44:12.080 --> 02:44:15.680
Like, of course, there's going to be some it's like anti-intellectualism,

02:44:15.680 --> 02:44:19.400
but like in a very specific way where they talk about like, oh, well,

02:44:19.960 --> 02:44:24.120
of course, like we need people who are like good at like trigonometry and stuff

02:44:24.120 --> 02:44:27.360
so that so that like we can figure out how to fire shells.

02:44:27.560 --> 02:44:31.840
But like if you never like apply that knowledge, then you're just like learning

02:44:31.840 --> 02:44:32.760
for the sake of learning.

02:44:32.760 --> 02:44:37.040
And this leads to like, you know, weak men and weak societies.

02:44:37.040 --> 02:44:38.800
Right. You have to do stuff. Right.

02:44:39.600 --> 02:44:42.200
Yeah. Which would be embodied if you like look at the 14 points

02:44:42.200 --> 02:44:44.600
like the the cult of action for action's sake.

02:44:44.840 --> 02:44:48.200
But like it goes like so much deeper than the four, 14 points

02:44:48.960 --> 02:44:52.680
because they they don't mean like don't learn anything.

02:44:52.680 --> 02:44:54.680
Lol. Don't learn how to do math.

02:44:54.680 --> 02:44:57.400
They mean like if you do math right.

02:44:57.520 --> 02:45:01.000
Learn how to use that knowledge for the state in some way.

02:45:01.200 --> 02:45:02.880
You know, so. Yeah.

02:45:02.880 --> 02:45:05.800
And the worst part about that is that is that people on the left

02:45:05.800 --> 02:45:09.680
tend to take that position that the fascists held and say,

02:45:10.160 --> 02:45:13.520
therefore, that means the fascists were always irrational all the time.

02:45:14.040 --> 02:45:16.120
It's like, well, no, that's not how that works.

02:45:16.120 --> 02:45:19.320
But you're you're not you're not listening to what they're saying.

02:45:19.320 --> 02:45:22.720
You see, you hear people say fascism is a fundamentally irrational position.

02:45:22.720 --> 02:45:23.920
It's like, well, no, not really.

02:45:23.920 --> 02:45:27.200
You know, they they have they had

02:45:28.360 --> 02:45:32.600
they were at war against reason for solely for reason's sake.

02:45:32.840 --> 02:45:35.040
That's true. But doesn't make them irrational.

02:45:35.040 --> 02:45:39.960
You know, and I do think that there's obviously I'm definitely a golden mean

02:45:40.200 --> 02:45:43.520
type of person when it comes to a lot of the things that I try to say and do.

02:45:43.800 --> 02:45:47.160
I think that there's obviously a middle ground between theorizing and acting.

02:45:47.160 --> 02:45:49.280
Right. Like you need both of it. You need both of it.

02:45:49.640 --> 02:45:52.800
If you if you live in a in a in a realm of pure theory,

02:45:52.800 --> 02:45:55.800
then you do end up being one of those left leaning elites

02:45:55.800 --> 02:45:58.440
that the right leaning people think exist. You know,

02:46:00.040 --> 02:46:04.120
I don't I don't like a lot of a lot of right wing solutions

02:46:04.160 --> 02:46:05.200
to problems.

02:46:05.200 --> 02:46:07.280
There are some good ones, but I generally don't like them.

02:46:07.280 --> 02:46:11.360
But they have some very good critiques of of liberalism

02:46:11.360 --> 02:46:14.920
and of socialism that I think they get ignored way too much.

02:46:15.160 --> 02:46:17.120
You know, people don't read Oakshot.

02:46:17.120 --> 02:46:20.440
People don't read, you know, these conservative political theorists.

02:46:21.120 --> 02:46:25.920
They just listen to like whatever Matt Gates is spouting or something, you know?

02:46:26.120 --> 02:46:27.960
Yeah, exactly.

02:46:28.640 --> 02:46:30.720
All righty. Well, I'm going to in stream here.

02:46:30.960 --> 02:46:34.000
I'll talk to chat for like probably a minute or so.

02:46:34.160 --> 02:46:37.000
But yeah, that was that was that was a lot of fun.

02:46:37.000 --> 02:46:38.640
I think I was here for like an hour or two.

02:46:38.640 --> 02:46:40.800
Yeah. Something about something along those lines.

02:46:41.200 --> 02:46:43.360
Really fun conversation.

02:46:43.360 --> 02:46:46.320
I I think we watched your video on fascism

02:46:46.800 --> 02:46:49.280
on stream a couple of months ago when I was still on Twitch.

02:46:49.280 --> 02:46:52.240
But I'm probably going to revisit that again,

02:46:52.240 --> 02:46:55.440
because it's probably one of the better videos on fascism scene.

02:46:55.440 --> 02:46:57.600
So I'm making a second one.

02:46:57.840 --> 02:46:59.440
Oh, fucking beast.

02:46:59.440 --> 02:47:03.560
I'm doing I'm currently working on another video and it's called

02:47:04.640 --> 02:47:07.480
Is fascism actually capitalism in decay?

02:47:07.960 --> 02:47:09.720
Oh, that's that's stupid.

02:47:09.720 --> 02:47:12.280
Yeah, I can't wait for that one.

02:47:12.280 --> 02:47:14.520
But the answer to that is like 90 percent.

02:47:14.520 --> 02:47:16.680
No, it's not. Yeah, it is not.

02:47:17.960 --> 02:47:19.560
Well, hey, man, it's been a fun conversation.

02:47:19.560 --> 02:47:21.160
I'll catch you later, right?

02:47:21.160 --> 02:47:22.960
Yep. I'll see you later. All right. Bye.
