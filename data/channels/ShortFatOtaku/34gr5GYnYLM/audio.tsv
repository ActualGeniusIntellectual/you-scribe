0	15320	I've got a lot of fond memories of E3, you know?
15320	20120	The Electronic Entertainment Expo, that once-a-year event generally held in May or June, where
20120	23720	all the various video game companies would come together and show off their upcoming
23720	25000	games for the next year.
25000	29880	Nintendo, Sega, Sony, Microsoft, Ubisoft, Capcom, Konami, pretty much all of the video
29880	34440	game developers that ever once had a period of being considered one of the big ones has
34440	37600	at one point or another had a presence at E3.
37600	41440	That presence tended to consist of a conference where a talking head would present their latest
41440	45920	products and a booth on the show floor where attendees could play demos of upcoming games.
45920	50200	Growing up as a 90s kid who loved video games, I enjoyed a Nintendo Power subscription, and
50200	53000	the E3 editions of those magazines were always great.
53000	56940	They'd always feature huge sections on upcoming games, and I vividly remember being a babby
56940	59440	dev vibrating with excitement over the whole thing.
59440	64200	It was around E3 2005 when the conferences began to be broadcast over the internet.
64200	67440	If there was live streams of them back then, I don't remember them, and they would have
67440	69800	been very low quality if they existed.
69800	74440	But websites like IGN did upload videos of the full conferences afterward for fans who
74440	75440	couldn't attend.
75440	80920	I remember there was a controversy during E3 2007 where the event was rebranded to focus
80920	85120	only on professional journalism, removing all the fun fan stuff.
85120	89640	This type of E3 lasted only two years, 2007 and 2008, before reverting to the original
89640	93800	format in 2009 due to the overwhelming unpopularity of that change.
93800	96940	It was around this time that I was watching the conferences along with a bunch of people
96940	99400	from 4chan's Vboard, and it was a lot of fun.
99400	102160	They'd always get so hyped and then ridiculously disappointed.
102160	106640	The history of E3 is one littered with incredible moments, from the memes that came out of the
106640	134560	PlayStation 3's horrendous announcement conference.
134560	162640	Whoops.
162640	176680	To Nintendo of America VP Reggie Fils-Aime's awkward and hilarious appearances over the
176680	198160	years.
198160	213320	To Peter Moore revealing Grand Theft Auto 4 and showing the audience he had the logo
213320	234800	tattooed on his arm.
264800	285680	To...
285680	301920	E3 always set the new memes the following year, at least in the gaming space.
301920	307260	In terms of total hype generated, the most successful E3 had to be 2015.
307260	309360	I know that may not be everyone else's choice.
309360	313440	You might choose the announcement of the 360 or the PS3 or the Wii, maybe the PS4.
313440	317880	Maybe not the Xbox One with its forced always online stuff that consumers boycotted so hard
343440	348160	And fortunately we have a product for people who aren't able to get some form of connectivity.
348160	349640	It's called Xbox 360.
349640	350640	Right.
350640	351640	So stick with 360, that's your message?
351640	352640	If you don't like it?
352640	357840	Well, if you have zero access to the internet, that is an offline device.
357840	374480	PlayStation 4 disc based games don't need to be connected online to play.
374480	377540	Or for any type of authentication.
377540	386040	If you enjoy playing single player games offline, PS4 won't require you to check in online periodically.
386040	387400	But hey, hear me out for a minute.
387400	390680	During E3 2015, some huge games were shown off.
390680	395400	Fallout 4, Mass Effect Andromeda, Horizon Zero Dawn, The Last Guardian, Nier Automata,
395400	398280	Kingdom Hearts 3, Deus Ex Mankind Divided, No Man's Sky.
398280	401200	Listen, I'm not making any statements about the quality of some of these games.
401200	405120	Only that they were high profile enough that gamers had their balls fucking blown off by
405120	406120	the news.
406120	410600	To me, probably the most iconic E3 clip of all time was the reaction of the guys at Game
410600	416020	Trailers Live to the Sony conferences one-two punch of announcing the Final Fantasy 7 remake.
416020	419100	Something that we all had a feeling was coming eventually, and the return of the Shenmue
419100	421220	franchise, which came completely out of left field.
506020	513500	E3 was at an all-time high, and it seemed like it could only go up from here.
513500	517600	By 2016, I had begun dating my current girlfriend, Naomi, who loves video games, but had never
517600	518600	heard of E3.
518600	521740	And when the time came for me to introduce it to her, unbeknownst to any of us, the expo
521740	524180	had begun its long, slow decline.
524180	529580	E3 2016 kicked off two days after the Orlando shooting at the gay nightclub Pulse.
529580	533260	Additionally, A Legend of Zelda YouTuber, Christina Grimmie, who was scheduled to be
533260	537660	a part of the expo, was killed three days earlier by an obsessed fan.
537660	540700	As a result, the event was changed drastically.
540700	544300	Flags were lowered to half-mast, each of the various conferences opened with tributes to
544300	548960	the victims of both events, and multiple moments of silence were observed during the presentations.
548960	553540	Many attendees chose to wear pride pins in remembrance of the Orlando nightclub shooting.
553540	555620	On the one hand, it is the appropriate thing to do.
555620	559580	The Pulse shooting is one of the most deadly mass shooting events in American history.
559580	563700	Furthermore, while E3 is about gaming, and not gay nightclubs, to the wider public, it
563700	567220	would look strange for them to not pay tribute to such a huge event that had just happened
567220	571220	while, at the same time, setting aside moments of silence for Grimmie, who died around the
571220	575740	same time and whose death was, outside of the gaming and YouTuber spaces, largely overshadowed
575740	576740	by Pulse.
576740	581060	However, while this was completely reasonable, at the same time, it was also the tragedy
581060	583180	that wokeoids exploited to worm their way in.
583180	587300	Now, I don't want to give you the impression that the downfall of E3 is as simple as get
587300	588300	woke go broke.
588300	589500	It's certainly not that.
589500	594420	They did get woke eventually, but they did so as a consequence of going broke first,
594420	597940	and they viewed wokeness as the final shot to pull themselves out of that hole.
597940	602280	That's not to say that the E3s between 2016 and 2020 were completely bereft of value.
602280	604620	They absolutely had their moments both based in cringe.
604620	607800	The final reveal of Zelda Breath of the Wild in Final Fantasy XV.
607800	612360	The rise of Josef Ferez as the next generation of conference meme maker, initially propelled
612360	614020	by his appearance at the Game Awards.
614020	638220	That one dude who constantly soid out over Jedi Fallen Order.
638220	642100	That one conference where Sony had announced almost no games and just had an elaborate
642100	643540	music performance instead.
643540	660700	That one YouTuber who shouted at Keanu Reeves.
660700	669320	And of course, we cannot forget the Ghostwire Tokyo waifu.
669320	673080	But it was during this period that E3 became massively bloated.
673080	675000	These magical moments were few and far between.
675000	678560	They were padded out with a combination of garbage games that nobody cared about, obnoxious
678560	684040	corpo ads that had almost nothing to do with gaming, an increasing emphasis on LGBTQ representation
684040	685360	and other woke nonsense.
685360	687840	E3 2020 was the real turning point.
687840	692300	This is when we all realized that the old E3 was finally dead and its corpse was being
692300	693880	piloted by Global Homo.
693880	698980	There was an absolutely atrocious E3 segment called Games for Change where it was only
698980	700720	about representation.
700720	705040	Hours upon hours of interviews with people where all they did was talk about intersectionality
705040	706300	in gaming.
706300	707300	Fucking shoot me.
707300	713020	Coronavirus had hamstrung E3 2020 quite a bit, but by 2021 it was entirely a virtual
713020	714600	conference due to the pandemic.
714600	718820	There was only the online presentations, no show floor, and they were even more bloated
718820	721720	with rainbow capitalist corpo woke nonsense.
721720	725880	And by 2022, the organization behind E3, the Entertainment Software Association, decided
725880	729220	to not hold E3 at all since at this point everyone could just stream their own thing
729220	730220	online anyway.
730220	732680	There was no physical show floor with booths that attendees could visit.
732680	733680	Was there even a point?
733680	737460	Yeah, all the companies did show off their own games all around the same time during
737460	741080	this not-E3 2020, but that was mainly at a convention at this point.
741080	744800	Everybody still had their shit ready to go, and with the advent of easy online streaming,
744800	748820	it wasn't hard for companies to hire some kid to just fire up OBS on their own and reveal
748820	750760	what they had on their own YouTube channels.
750760	754280	Nintendo had been doing this for nearly a decade at this point with their Nintendo Direct
754280	755280	format.
755280	759360	They stopped having physical conferences at E3 back in 2013, opting for their own live
759360	763780	show, only maintaining a physical presence on the show floor to present playable demos.
763780	768540	But the people behind E3 promised everyone that in 2023, with the various pandemic restrictions
768540	772500	safely in the rearview mirror, the Electronics Entertainment Expo would be back to full strength
772500	773500	once again.
773500	775300	But at this point, people just didn't care anymore.
775300	780420	E3 was shit for years, and moving all the important stuff to the online streams, broadcasted
780420	785180	by each individual company due to the coronavirus pandemic, was the final nail in the coffin
785180	786180	for the whole thing.
786180	790420	E3 came out of lockdowns, realizing that nobody wanted or needed it anymore.
790420	794880	Despite the grand proclamation that E3 was back, one by one each noteworthy company announced
794880	797400	that they were dropping out until there was nobody left.
797400	801120	That doesn't mean that the appetite for an E3-like event had vanished, though.
801120	805800	Geoff Keighley's Summer Games Fest and the German in-person event Gamescom are both booming
805800	806800	right now.
806800	807800	E3, though?
807800	808800	That's dead.
808800	809800	Nobody cares about it anymore.
809800	813240	The name E3 once made people think of an amazing event where the next big thing was going to
813240	814240	be announced.
814240	816420	The gaming mecha that every kid wanted to one day attend.
816420	820020	Now it just makes people think about drag queens who lecture you on stream about how
820020	823780	you're a bigot because you like jiggly boobs and fat asses in your video games.
823780	826460	People still want E3 at its core, the old E3.
826460	828180	They still want what it was.
828180	832820	But what it was is no longer contained within the institution that is known as E3.
832820	836340	That essence has moved on to other locations, and the audience has followed suit.
836340	841300	E3 will probably continue in some form, in some husk-like state, being worn as yet another
841300	842580	progressive skinsuit.
842580	846200	But unless there's some drastic shakeup at the top level, akin to Elon buying Twitter
846200	850140	or something, the E3 we all know and love is dead, and it won't be coming back.
850140	854740	We will never again see the ridiculousness of an eight-foot-tall, custom-sculpted Shadow
854740	859360	the Hedgehog statue hauled onto the floor of the LA Convention Center, a massive money
859360	862240	sink meant to advertise the shittiest of games.
862240	863800	I wonder where that thing ended up.
863800	865940	Is it at the back of a closet at Sega HQ?
865940	867080	Is it in somebody's living room?
867080	871520	We'll never know, and we will never see its like again.
871520	873320	Hey guys, I hope you enjoyed the video.
873320	876320	Thanks for watching, and of course, thanks for sticking around after everything else.
876320	881380	If you want to see more of me on my side channel, The Dev Kit, my girlfriend and I just watched
881380	884180	the Dungeons and Dragons Honor Among Thieves movie.
884180	887860	If you want to see us talk about it, click the link on screen, and I'll see you over
887860	888860	there.
888860	889860	Have a good one, guys.
889860	889880	I love you.
