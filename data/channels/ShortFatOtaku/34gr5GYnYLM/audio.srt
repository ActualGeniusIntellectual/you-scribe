1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,320
I've got a lot of fond memories of E3, you know?

2
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:20,120
The Electronic Entertainment Expo, that once-a-year event generally held in May or June, where

3
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,720
all the various video game companies would come together and show off their upcoming

4
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,000
games for the next year.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,880
Nintendo, Sega, Sony, Microsoft, Ubisoft, Capcom, Konami, pretty much all of the video

6
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:34,440
game developers that ever once had a period of being considered one of the big ones has

7
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,600
at one point or another had a presence at E3.

8
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,440
That presence tended to consist of a conference where a talking head would present their latest

9
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,920
products and a booth on the show floor where attendees could play demos of upcoming games.

10
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,200
Growing up as a 90s kid who loved video games, I enjoyed a Nintendo Power subscription, and

11
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,000
the E3 editions of those magazines were always great.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,940
They'd always feature huge sections on upcoming games, and I vividly remember being a babby

13
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,440
dev vibrating with excitement over the whole thing.

14
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:04,200
It was around E3 2005 when the conferences began to be broadcast over the internet.

15
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,440
If there was live streams of them back then, I don't remember them, and they would have

16
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,800
been very low quality if they existed.

17
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:14,440
But websites like IGN did upload videos of the full conferences afterward for fans who

18
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,440
couldn't attend.

19
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:20,920
I remember there was a controversy during E3 2007 where the event was rebranded to focus

20
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:25,120
only on professional journalism, removing all the fun fan stuff.

21
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:29,640
This type of E3 lasted only two years, 2007 and 2008, before reverting to the original

22
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,800
format in 2009 due to the overwhelming unpopularity of that change.

23
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,940
It was around this time that I was watching the conferences along with a bunch of people

24
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:39,400
from 4chan's Vboard, and it was a lot of fun.

25
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,160
They'd always get so hyped and then ridiculously disappointed.

26
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:46,640
The history of E3 is one littered with incredible moments, from the memes that came out of the

27
00:01:46,640 --> 00:02:14,560
PlayStation 3's horrendous announcement conference.

28
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:42,640
Whoops.

29
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:56,680
To Nintendo of America VP Reggie Fils-Aime's awkward and hilarious appearances over the

30
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:18,160
years.

31
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:33,320
To Peter Moore revealing Grand Theft Auto 4 and showing the audience he had the logo

32
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:54,800
tattooed on his arm.

33
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:45,680
To...

34
00:04:45,680 --> 00:05:01,920
E3 always set the new memes the following year, at least in the gaming space.

35
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:07,260
In terms of total hype generated, the most successful E3 had to be 2015.

36
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:09,360
I know that may not be everyone else's choice.

37
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,440
You might choose the announcement of the 360 or the PS3 or the Wii, maybe the PS4.

38
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,880
Maybe not the Xbox One with its forced always online stuff that consumers boycotted so hard

39
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:48,160
And fortunately we have a product for people who aren't able to get some form of connectivity.

40
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,640
It's called Xbox 360.

41
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,640
Right.

42
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,640
So stick with 360, that's your message?

43
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,640
If you don't like it?

44
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:57,840
Well, if you have zero access to the internet, that is an offline device.

45
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:14,480
PlayStation 4 disc based games don't need to be connected online to play.

46
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,540
Or for any type of authentication.

47
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:26,040
If you enjoy playing single player games offline, PS4 won't require you to check in online periodically.

48
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,400
But hey, hear me out for a minute.

49
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,680
During E3 2015, some huge games were shown off.

50
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:35,400
Fallout 4, Mass Effect Andromeda, Horizon Zero Dawn, The Last Guardian, Nier Automata,

51
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,280
Kingdom Hearts 3, Deus Ex Mankind Divided, No Man's Sky.

52
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:41,200
Listen, I'm not making any statements about the quality of some of these games.

53
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:45,120
Only that they were high profile enough that gamers had their balls fucking blown off by

54
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,120
the news.

55
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:50,600
To me, probably the most iconic E3 clip of all time was the reaction of the guys at Game

56
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:56,020
Trailers Live to the Sony conferences one-two punch of announcing the Final Fantasy 7 remake.

57
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:59,100
Something that we all had a feeling was coming eventually, and the return of the Shenmue

58
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,220
franchise, which came completely out of left field.

59
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:33,500
E3 was at an all-time high, and it seemed like it could only go up from here.

60
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:37,600
By 2016, I had begun dating my current girlfriend, Naomi, who loves video games, but had never

61
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,600
heard of E3.

62
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,740
And when the time came for me to introduce it to her, unbeknownst to any of us, the expo

63
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:44,180
had begun its long, slow decline.

64
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:49,580
E3 2016 kicked off two days after the Orlando shooting at the gay nightclub Pulse.

65
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:53,260
Additionally, A Legend of Zelda YouTuber, Christina Grimmie, who was scheduled to be

66
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:57,660
a part of the expo, was killed three days earlier by an obsessed fan.

67
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:00,700
As a result, the event was changed drastically.

68
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:04,300
Flags were lowered to half-mast, each of the various conferences opened with tributes to

69
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:08,960
the victims of both events, and multiple moments of silence were observed during the presentations.

70
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:13,540
Many attendees chose to wear pride pins in remembrance of the Orlando nightclub shooting.

71
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:15,620
On the one hand, it is the appropriate thing to do.

72
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:19,580
The Pulse shooting is one of the most deadly mass shooting events in American history.

73
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:23,700
Furthermore, while E3 is about gaming, and not gay nightclubs, to the wider public, it

74
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:27,220
would look strange for them to not pay tribute to such a huge event that had just happened

75
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:31,220
while, at the same time, setting aside moments of silence for Grimmie, who died around the

76
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:35,740
same time and whose death was, outside of the gaming and YouTuber spaces, largely overshadowed

77
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:36,740
by Pulse.

78
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:41,060
However, while this was completely reasonable, at the same time, it was also the tragedy

79
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:43,180
that wokeoids exploited to worm their way in.

80
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:47,300
Now, I don't want to give you the impression that the downfall of E3 is as simple as get

81
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,300
woke go broke.

82
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,500
It's certainly not that.

83
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:54,420
They did get woke eventually, but they did so as a consequence of going broke first,

84
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:57,940
and they viewed wokeness as the final shot to pull themselves out of that hole.

85
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:02,280
That's not to say that the E3s between 2016 and 2020 were completely bereft of value.

86
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,620
They absolutely had their moments both based in cringe.

87
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:07,800
The final reveal of Zelda Breath of the Wild in Final Fantasy XV.

88
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:12,360
The rise of Josef Ferez as the next generation of conference meme maker, initially propelled

89
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,020
by his appearance at the Game Awards.

90
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:38,220
That one dude who constantly soid out over Jedi Fallen Order.

91
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:42,100
That one conference where Sony had announced almost no games and just had an elaborate

92
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,540
music performance instead.

93
00:10:43,540 --> 00:11:00,700
That one YouTuber who shouted at Keanu Reeves.

94
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:09,320
And of course, we cannot forget the Ghostwire Tokyo waifu.

95
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:13,080
But it was during this period that E3 became massively bloated.

96
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,000
These magical moments were few and far between.

97
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,560
They were padded out with a combination of garbage games that nobody cared about, obnoxious

98
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:24,040
corpo ads that had almost nothing to do with gaming, an increasing emphasis on LGBTQ representation

99
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,360
and other woke nonsense.

100
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,840
E3 2020 was the real turning point.

101
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:32,300
This is when we all realized that the old E3 was finally dead and its corpse was being

102
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,880
piloted by Global Homo.

103
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:38,980
There was an absolutely atrocious E3 segment called Games for Change where it was only

104
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,720
about representation.

105
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:45,040
Hours upon hours of interviews with people where all they did was talk about intersectionality

106
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,300
in gaming.

107
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,300
Fucking shoot me.

108
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:53,020
Coronavirus had hamstrung E3 2020 quite a bit, but by 2021 it was entirely a virtual

109
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,600
conference due to the pandemic.

110
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:58,820
There was only the online presentations, no show floor, and they were even more bloated

111
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:01,720
with rainbow capitalist corpo woke nonsense.

112
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:05,880
And by 2022, the organization behind E3, the Entertainment Software Association, decided

113
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:09,220
to not hold E3 at all since at this point everyone could just stream their own thing

114
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:10,220
online anyway.

115
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:12,680
There was no physical show floor with booths that attendees could visit.

116
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,680
Was there even a point?

117
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,460
Yeah, all the companies did show off their own games all around the same time during

118
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:21,080
this not-E3 2020, but that was mainly at a convention at this point.

119
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:24,800
Everybody still had their shit ready to go, and with the advent of easy online streaming,

120
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,820
it wasn't hard for companies to hire some kid to just fire up OBS on their own and reveal

121
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,760
what they had on their own YouTube channels.

122
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:34,280
Nintendo had been doing this for nearly a decade at this point with their Nintendo Direct

123
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,280
format.

124
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:39,360
They stopped having physical conferences at E3 back in 2013, opting for their own live

125
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,780
show, only maintaining a physical presence on the show floor to present playable demos.

126
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:48,540
But the people behind E3 promised everyone that in 2023, with the various pandemic restrictions

127
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:52,500
safely in the rearview mirror, the Electronics Entertainment Expo would be back to full strength

128
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,500
once again.

129
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,300
But at this point, people just didn't care anymore.

130
00:12:55,300 --> 00:13:00,420
E3 was shit for years, and moving all the important stuff to the online streams, broadcasted

131
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:05,180
by each individual company due to the coronavirus pandemic, was the final nail in the coffin

132
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,180
for the whole thing.

133
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:10,420
E3 came out of lockdowns, realizing that nobody wanted or needed it anymore.

134
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:14,880
Despite the grand proclamation that E3 was back, one by one each noteworthy company announced

135
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,400
that they were dropping out until there was nobody left.

136
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:21,120
That doesn't mean that the appetite for an E3-like event had vanished, though.

137
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,800
Geoff Keighley's Summer Games Fest and the German in-person event Gamescom are both booming

138
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,800
right now.

139
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,800
E3, though?

140
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,800
That's dead.

141
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,800
Nobody cares about it anymore.

142
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:33,240
The name E3 once made people think of an amazing event where the next big thing was going to

143
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,240
be announced.

144
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,420
The gaming mecha that every kid wanted to one day attend.

145
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:40,020
Now it just makes people think about drag queens who lecture you on stream about how

146
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:43,780
you're a bigot because you like jiggly boobs and fat asses in your video games.

147
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:46,460
People still want E3 at its core, the old E3.

148
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:48,180
They still want what it was.

149
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:52,820
But what it was is no longer contained within the institution that is known as E3.

150
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:56,340
That essence has moved on to other locations, and the audience has followed suit.

151
00:13:56,340 --> 00:14:01,300
E3 will probably continue in some form, in some husk-like state, being worn as yet another

152
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,580
progressive skinsuit.

153
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:06,200
But unless there's some drastic shakeup at the top level, akin to Elon buying Twitter

154
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:10,140
or something, the E3 we all know and love is dead, and it won't be coming back.

155
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:14,740
We will never again see the ridiculousness of an eight-foot-tall, custom-sculpted Shadow

156
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:19,360
the Hedgehog statue hauled onto the floor of the LA Convention Center, a massive money

157
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,240
sink meant to advertise the shittiest of games.

158
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,800
I wonder where that thing ended up.

159
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,940
Is it at the back of a closet at Sega HQ?

160
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,080
Is it in somebody's living room?

161
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:31,520
We'll never know, and we will never see its like again.

162
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,320
