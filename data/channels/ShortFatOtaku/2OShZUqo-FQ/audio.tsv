0	6320	Hello, everyone.
6320	12240	As you can tell by the different thumbnail of this video, I've decided to do these every
12240	14320	single day for the rest of my channel.
14320	15320	No, I'm kidding.
15320	16320	Obviously not.
16320	19880	I am going to do, maybe we'll do like TikTok Tuesdays or something because it's a video
19880	24960	that I can shoot easily, which frees up time for me to do other more in-depth projects.
24960	27960	For example, tonight I'm going on Adam and Sitch.
27960	29420	We're talking more Moldbug.
29420	35280	And so rather than doing a longer video and kind of painstakingly editing it together,
35280	40740	I can just slap this together in half an hour or so, maybe an hour at most for those busier
40740	41740	days.
41740	43580	I know some of you were saying, but Dave, you hired an editor.
43580	44580	Yeah, I know.
44580	45580	Guess what?
45580	46840	Dave's computer is actually broken too.
46840	51240	So hey, if you feel like donating an extra few bucks, maybe we can get things back on
51240	52240	the road again.
52240	57280	But anyway, I have collected a number of ridiculous things we may watch yet again.
57280	58760	Let's have some fun, guys.
58800	63200	And by fun, I mean, let's turn our brains into melted cheese.
63200	67800	If you want my future, I'm gonna get you fast.
67800	71800	If you wanna get with me, turn your face into a mask.
71800	75800	You're not gonna be wasting this precious time.
75800	80800	I'll get you in the dark and then commit this crime.
80800	83800	Don't tell you what I want, but I really want my soul.
83800	85800	I really want your soul.
85800	86800	Your soul.
86800	87800	Your soul.
87840	88840	Your soul.
88840	89840	Your soul.
89840	92840	If you wanna be a corpse, I'll bring it to my basement.
92840	93840	That's right.
93840	95340	I won't feel no remorse.
95340	96840	This has to be a joke.
96840	97840	Nothing lasts.
97840	99900	Dude, this has to be...
99900	101900	This has to just be a joke.
101900	105400	I mean, if it is, they got me, but...
105400	111320	Man, imagine the last thing you see is this person coming at you.
111320	112320	I want...
112320	113320	I want your soul.
113320	116320	This one's got no sound to it.
116840	121320	It just appears to be a bunch of people ransacking a fucking target.
121320	124320	Oh my God.
124320	129320	They're just stealing everything out of the target.
129320	131320	Like fuck it, we're just taking it all.
131320	133320	You keep seeing videos of...
133320	136320	See, I know some people say black people, it's not all black people, there's a white
136320	137320	woman doing it.
137320	144660	But like, I know you keep seeing these videos go viral of just constant, rampant, unending
144680	151420	theft, and no one cares anymore, no one is interested in being part of the social contract
151420	158540	anymore, no one's a decent human being anymore, and you know what?
158540	161100	These stores, they will eventually close down, right?
161100	165020	They can't just operate like this forever, they can't operate at eternal losses.
165020	169660	Eventually these stores will close, and then these communities will have nowhere to actually
169660	172540	get anything, and they'll just all be fucked.
172540	174540	What a shit show.
174540	178740	I'm literally shaking right now, because I just had a man approach me in a parking lot,
178740	181820	and it went fine, and I'm going to tell you why it went fine and how to address it, because
181820	185780	it was in a book I read, and this is how you're supposed to address it, but it scared me.
185780	187180	I'm literally shaking.
187180	196420	So this guy, I'm alone with my son, by myself, a woman, and a male approached me in a parking
196420	197420	lot.
197420	200380	He's like, excuse me, miss, and I don't know why in the hell he was approaching me or what
200380	206300	he was trying to do, and he was probably 30 feet from me when he said, excuse me, ma'am,
206300	211500	and I turned around, and I literally yelled at him, and I said, do not approach me.
211500	212500	What?
212500	217020	And he immediately started going in the other direction, and I just kept saying it over
217020	218020	and over and over.
218020	225180	I said, do not approach me, do not approach me, and he, of course, got like, what the
225180	228380	eff, like, he started cussing and yelling, like, what's your problem?
228380	233940	And I looked at him, and he started, he actually then crossed a couple cars down from my car,
233940	236100	and he didn't come anywhere near me.
236100	241060	He crossed a couple cars down from my car, and was like, what's your problem, and I said,
241060	243300	you do not approach women in a parking lot.
243300	245440	I just kept saying, do not approach me.
245440	248820	You do not approach women in a parking lot, like, yelling it.
248820	254500	No male, no male should ever approach a woman in a parking lot, ever.
254500	258040	No male should ever approach a woman in a parking lot, and if a male does approach you,
258040	262600	you need to turn around and use the strongest voice that you can possibly use with them.
262600	263600	Don't be polite.
263600	264780	They need to literally screw off.
264780	266520	No male should be approaching you in a parking lot.
266520	267520	Wow.
267520	272520	Okay, so I guess if a woman, you know, drops her wallet or something, guys, it's fair game.
272520	275440	You can't approach women in a parking lot anymore for any reason.
275440	277320	If you left her son behind in the cart, nope.
277320	278800	You got to leave that kid there.
278800	279800	Sorry, kid.
279800	281800	It's a, it's a sexist for me to approach your mother.
281800	287520	There are a thousand innocent reasons as to why you might go up to a stranger in a park,
287520	289320	in a parking lot, and say something.
289320	291280	To just immediately react like this.
291280	297040	This is like, this is pure, I don't know what you, what you want to call it, like, it's,
297040	298040	it's kind of schizo.
298040	299680	It's not really conspiracy brain.
299680	304960	It's just like, assuming that every single person has it out for you at all times.
304960	305960	Sometimes they do.
305960	306960	A lot of times they don't, you know?
306960	308960	Oh, this one's an old one.
308960	310960	You guys Americans?
310960	314440	You guys here to spread sodomy or what?
315440	319040	Isn't that what America's number one export is?
319040	321320	So these are like American soldiers in Poland.
321320	323480	Is it George Floyd culture or is it sodomy?
323480	325280	George Floyd culture!
325280	328080	Yeah, these are American soldiers in Poland.
328080	331480	What do you guys think about your health secretary being a fucking tranny?
331480	334960	Jesus Christ, dude, you're gonna get me fucking demonetized.
334960	341000	So yeah, this guy is just like harassing random soldiers because they're soldiers stationed
341000	342000	in Poland.
342000	349240	Defending a country that has, there's no meaning to be a citizen, like any, any Mexican crossing
349240	353440	the border is literally one of you.
353440	357640	Like regardless of his complaints, they're mostly stupid complaints too, but like regardless
357640	364800	of any of them, what is harassing for anal sex to Poland?
364800	367560	Like even he's laughing how dumb it is.
368560	372760	Like, you're just bugging for random soldiers, dude.
372760	375560	He's lucky they don't just like knock him out, you know?
382560	385560	Jesus Christ, what a fucking asshole, dude.
385560	387880	Dude, what a fucking asshole, man.
387880	391160	Like regardless of how you feel about any of these issues, and in my opinion, a lot
391160	394880	of his views on these things were just fucking stupid, but regardless of how you feel about
394880	400320	any of these issues, man, harassing random ass soldiers, I guess that doesn't help your
400320	401320	case.
401320	402320	It doesn't help anyone.
402320	403320	It just makes people fucking hate you.
403320	405200	Oh, I remember this one.
405200	415400	This was like woke cards against humanity and more kinky queers just needs less subconscious
415400	420400	self sabotaging patterns and more magic mushrooms.
420920	423920	Oh my god, guys.
423920	425920	That's a really good one.
425920	428920	Less being ghosted and more accountability.
428920	429920	Wow.
429920	430920	Oh my god.
430920	435920	Less celery juice, more psychedelic.
435920	440920	Less overthinking absolutely everything, more polyamory.
440920	442920	Fucking hell.
442920	445920	Less love and light, more tearing down the patriarchy.
445920	447920	These are all really good.
448440	449440	Oh yeah, guys.
449440	450440	That sounds like a game that I want to break.
450440	451440	You know what?
451440	455440	I've only really played Cards Against Humanity like once or twice, and I didn't, like, not
455440	456440	my kind of game.
456440	457440	I didn't really like it.
457440	460440	I can see why people like it, though, because there's some edgy cards in there, right?
460440	464440	At least the original set, but like that just sounds un-fun.
464440	465440	There's no edginess there.
465440	468440	It's just constant reaffirmation of woke politics.
468440	473840	Like, I don't know if you guys remember, but yeah, this is like going way back like the
473880	476080	gamergate days, I think.
476080	480680	But Cards Against Humanity, you know, for those of you who don't know, it has some really
480680	482480	edgy cards in there, alright?
482480	488920	There's some stuff that's like pretty grotesque, pretty over the line, definitely shock value
488920	490600	humor in there, right?
490600	495640	However, the creators of the game, like around the time of gamergate, came out and they went
495640	500920	like full hardcore SJW in the gamergate era, and then they've gone like hyper woke since
500920	501920	then.
501920	502920	You know what I mean?
503000	507720	Like all of their old problematic cards have been taken out of the game and replaced with
507720	508720	shit like this.
508720	514960	Okay, so the heading for this is, being a fat person in a skinny capitalist society.
514960	515960	Oh, okay.
515960	518560	I'm also a fellow fat, so lay it on me.
518560	521920	Why don't they make things for fat people specifically?
521920	522920	This kid ain't fat.
522920	525000	Why aren't we included in shit, you know?
525000	529760	I got a knee brace a while ago because I really, really, really need a knee brace because my
529760	531400	knees are fucking awful, right?
531400	532400	Because you're fat.
532880	538080	You have to measure your calf and your thigh and shit like that so you can get the proper
538080	539080	size, okay?
539080	540840	Well, I got the proper size.
540840	545120	I got the size that fits my knee of the knee brace, right?
545120	551920	But they come with this little spandex knee sock thing, so you don't like hurt your fucking
551920	552920	knee.
552920	558960	You don't like mess up your skin and shit because it fucking hurts sometimes, right?
558960	560960	Put a thought together, buddy.
560960	561960	Guess what?
561960	565120	The knee sock doesn't fit right.
565120	571040	It rolls all the way down, and when I pull it up to where it needs to be, it's like he's
571040	573040	wearing thigh highs.
573040	577240	One size fits all only works if you're skinny.
577240	580480	Fat people can't find cute clothes that fit them.
580480	585360	Fat people can't get fucking knee braces that work correctly.
585360	587480	Why do you guys hate us so much?
587480	590680	What the fuck are we doing that's so wrong?
591400	592400	I'm just a fat man.
592400	594000	I'm just a fat guy.
594000	595000	That's it.
595000	596000	That's it.
596000	597000	I'm just a fat dude.
597000	601640	Why do you skinny people feel the need to, first of all, treat us like shit, and second
601640	607320	of all, not fucking allow us to have things we need or fucking wear things we want to
607320	608320	wear?
608320	612280	There's a lot of fat people in the world, like a lot of fat people.
612280	616600	It's a really common thing to be fat, and honestly, half the time it doesn't have anything
616600	619280	to do with your eating habits.
619280	620480	That's not true.
620480	621480	That's fucking false.
621480	623600	You know one of the big reasons people get fat because we're stressed out.
623600	624600	You want to know why?
624600	625600	Capitalism!
625600	629600	It all comes down to capitalism!
629600	631600	Oh my fucking god, guys.
631600	633120	You're fat because capitalism.
633120	634760	How retarded is that?
634760	636200	I mean, you know what?
636200	637360	Technically true.
637360	641720	Capitalism's extreme wealth and abundance has made it so that food is actually hyper
641720	646720	cheap compared to the way it was 1,000 years ago, and so poor people are actually more
646720	648920	fat rather than starving and skinny.
648920	652440	But no, the actual truth is, fat people aren't physically attractive.
652440	653440	Not usually.
653440	655160	I mean, hold on, it depends.
655160	658160	There's some girls out there with fat in the right places, but you know what I'm talking
658160	659160	about, right?
659160	663080	It's not that they don't make cute clothes for fat people, it's that once you hit a certain
663080	667320	level of fat, you don't look cute in any clothes.
667320	673400	And if you're sitting here blaming your fatness on capitalism or stress, hold on, where fat
673400	675480	is stressed, oh, does that mean you're eating?
675480	676480	Stop fucking eating!
676480	677900	Listen, I'm a fat guy.
677900	679180	I know how much I eat.
679180	680580	I know it's too much.
680580	682860	I know what's causing this, okay?
682860	683860	It is me.
683860	684860	Oh shit!
684860	685860	Antifa's out in the streets!
685860	688860	Washington, this is like a pride march, not Antifa.
688860	705860	Are they just like, yeah, they're just gonna block traffic, because fuck you, I guess.
705860	716060	Like, imagine being this guy.
716060	718120	You can't ride around in your car anymore.
718120	719120	Fuck you.
719120	727060	Look at this piece of shit, what the fuck?
727060	730940	Trans lives matter, so we're blocking you from driving around!
730940	737900	Like, what the fuck is this?
737900	743900	Man, if you ever want people to like hate the trans movement, this is how you do it.
743900	747340	You're just going along, you're driving to work, driving to the store or whatever, minding
747340	751340	your own business, suddenly a bunch of these people show up and start banging on your car
751340	752660	and screaming about transphobia.
752660	753660	What the fuck?
753660	756420	All right, after that, I need a palate cleanser.
756420	759180	And hey, this lady's got something for us to drink.
759180	777020	Oh my god, dude, okay, they're spilling it everywhere!
777020	783260	What is this, like the wine ant anthem, where you have like 40 year old aged hipsters drinking
783260	787540	wine out of mason jars, trying to get as drunk as possible because they're so desensitized
787540	789580	to alcohol, their liver's already like shot.
789580	791940	Jesus, this person's not very happy, are they?
791940	797700	So Tristan and Andrew Tate are now in house arrest, which is not quite out of jail, but
797700	801820	it's progress, which progress is good always, we take those.
801820	809100	I send a voice note to both him and Andrew, honestly I'm just very happy that the truth
809100	815700	actually eventually comes out, and it's just fucking unacceptable that all the, you know,
815700	819980	forget the jail time, forget the time there, ultimately people like Tristan and Andrew
819980	822140	will use this to their advantage.
822140	824360	This guy's like hardcore simping.
824360	832260	Now think about all these fucking worms and insects that spoke about them as if they committed
832260	837580	the crimes they're being said they committed, without any proof, okay?
837580	842340	And these people like Hasanabi, Destiny, I don't know what the truth is, I don't watch
842340	843340	any of it.
843340	866220	These guys, man, imagine simping for Andrew Tate this hard.
866220	868580	Would you say they're Gusano?
868580	873940	Dude, imagine sucking off the Tate brothers this hard.
873940	879660	This guy's got like a full mouthful right up to the brim of Tate semen just slurping
879660	881100	down right now.
881100	882900	Man, who cares?
882900	886740	I've done a few Andrew Tate videos, you know, it's a new story.
886740	889960	I personally don't actually care that much.
889960	894460	I don't know Andrew Tate, he's not part of my life, his business is not my business,
894460	900460	he exists for me in so far as I can make videos, talk about a story, but for me personally,
900460	903000	it doesn't actually matter.
903000	908320	Imagine being a fanboy this hard, or hating him this hard too, like fuck.
908320	914060	Just as you shouldn't simp for e-girls, do not simp for the Tates either, guys, alright?
914060	916260	My half hour's nearly up, let's do one more.
916260	920460	A short, attractive guy, or a tall, ugly guy?
920460	922460	Tall, ugly.
923460	926460	Who edited this?
926460	932460	It's just a pause in her face, in the actual video, just a pause in her face, for real.
932460	934460	Oh my god.
934460	942260	Listen, lady, I hope you understand here, but the question was tall and ugly versus
942260	947460	short and attractive, and the only thing I'll say is, you are neither tall nor attractive.
