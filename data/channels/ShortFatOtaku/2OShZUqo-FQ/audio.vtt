00:00.000 --> 00:06.320
Hello, everyone.

00:06.320 --> 00:12.240
As you can tell by the different thumbnail of this video, I've decided to do these every

00:12.240 --> 00:14.320
single day for the rest of my channel.

00:14.320 --> 00:15.320
No, I'm kidding.

00:15.320 --> 00:16.320
Obviously not.

00:16.320 --> 00:19.880
I am going to do, maybe we'll do like TikTok Tuesdays or something because it's a video

00:19.880 --> 00:24.960
that I can shoot easily, which frees up time for me to do other more in-depth projects.

00:24.960 --> 00:27.960
For example, tonight I'm going on Adam and Sitch.

00:27.960 --> 00:29.420
We're talking more Moldbug.

00:29.420 --> 00:35.280
And so rather than doing a longer video and kind of painstakingly editing it together,

00:35.280 --> 00:40.740
I can just slap this together in half an hour or so, maybe an hour at most for those busier

00:40.740 --> 00:41.740
days.

00:41.740 --> 00:43.580
I know some of you were saying, but Dave, you hired an editor.

00:43.580 --> 00:44.580
Yeah, I know.

00:44.580 --> 00:45.580
Guess what?

00:45.580 --> 00:46.840
Dave's computer is actually broken too.

00:46.840 --> 00:51.240
So hey, if you feel like donating an extra few bucks, maybe we can get things back on

00:51.240 --> 00:52.240
the road again.

00:52.240 --> 00:57.280
But anyway, I have collected a number of ridiculous things we may watch yet again.

00:57.280 --> 00:58.760
Let's have some fun, guys.

00:58.800 --> 01:03.200
And by fun, I mean, let's turn our brains into melted cheese.

01:03.200 --> 01:07.800
If you want my future, I'm gonna get you fast.

01:07.800 --> 01:11.800
If you wanna get with me, turn your face into a mask.

01:11.800 --> 01:15.800
You're not gonna be wasting this precious time.

01:15.800 --> 01:20.800
I'll get you in the dark and then commit this crime.

01:20.800 --> 01:23.800
Don't tell you what I want, but I really want my soul.

01:23.800 --> 01:25.800
I really want your soul.

01:25.800 --> 01:26.800
Your soul.

01:26.800 --> 01:27.800
Your soul.

01:27.840 --> 01:28.840
Your soul.

01:28.840 --> 01:29.840
Your soul.

01:29.840 --> 01:32.840
If you wanna be a corpse, I'll bring it to my basement.

01:32.840 --> 01:33.840
That's right.

01:33.840 --> 01:35.340
I won't feel no remorse.

01:35.340 --> 01:36.840
This has to be a joke.

01:36.840 --> 01:37.840
Nothing lasts.

01:37.840 --> 01:39.900
Dude, this has to be...

01:39.900 --> 01:41.900
This has to just be a joke.

01:41.900 --> 01:45.400
I mean, if it is, they got me, but...

01:45.400 --> 01:51.320
Man, imagine the last thing you see is this person coming at you.

01:51.320 --> 01:52.320
I want...

01:52.320 --> 01:53.320
I want your soul.

01:53.320 --> 01:56.320
This one's got no sound to it.

01:56.840 --> 02:01.320
It just appears to be a bunch of people ransacking a fucking target.

02:01.320 --> 02:04.320
Oh my God.

02:04.320 --> 02:09.320
They're just stealing everything out of the target.

02:09.320 --> 02:11.320
Like fuck it, we're just taking it all.

02:11.320 --> 02:13.320
You keep seeing videos of...

02:13.320 --> 02:16.320
See, I know some people say black people, it's not all black people, there's a white

02:16.320 --> 02:17.320
woman doing it.

02:17.320 --> 02:24.660
But like, I know you keep seeing these videos go viral of just constant, rampant, unending

02:24.680 --> 02:31.420
theft, and no one cares anymore, no one is interested in being part of the social contract

02:31.420 --> 02:38.540
anymore, no one's a decent human being anymore, and you know what?

02:38.540 --> 02:41.100
These stores, they will eventually close down, right?

02:41.100 --> 02:45.020
They can't just operate like this forever, they can't operate at eternal losses.

02:45.020 --> 02:49.660
Eventually these stores will close, and then these communities will have nowhere to actually

02:49.660 --> 02:52.540
get anything, and they'll just all be fucked.

02:52.540 --> 02:54.540
What a shit show.

02:54.540 --> 02:58.740
I'm literally shaking right now, because I just had a man approach me in a parking lot,

02:58.740 --> 03:01.820
and it went fine, and I'm going to tell you why it went fine and how to address it, because

03:01.820 --> 03:05.780
it was in a book I read, and this is how you're supposed to address it, but it scared me.

03:05.780 --> 03:07.180
I'm literally shaking.

03:07.180 --> 03:16.420
So this guy, I'm alone with my son, by myself, a woman, and a male approached me in a parking

03:16.420 --> 03:17.420
lot.

03:17.420 --> 03:20.380
He's like, excuse me, miss, and I don't know why in the hell he was approaching me or what

03:20.380 --> 03:26.300
he was trying to do, and he was probably 30 feet from me when he said, excuse me, ma'am,

03:26.300 --> 03:31.500
and I turned around, and I literally yelled at him, and I said, do not approach me.

03:31.500 --> 03:32.500
What?

03:32.500 --> 03:37.020
And he immediately started going in the other direction, and I just kept saying it over

03:37.020 --> 03:38.020
and over and over.

03:38.020 --> 03:45.180
I said, do not approach me, do not approach me, and he, of course, got like, what the

03:45.180 --> 03:48.380
eff, like, he started cussing and yelling, like, what's your problem?

03:48.380 --> 03:53.940
And I looked at him, and he started, he actually then crossed a couple cars down from my car,

03:53.940 --> 03:56.100
and he didn't come anywhere near me.

03:56.100 --> 04:01.060
He crossed a couple cars down from my car, and was like, what's your problem, and I said,

04:01.060 --> 04:03.300
you do not approach women in a parking lot.

04:03.300 --> 04:05.440
I just kept saying, do not approach me.

04:05.440 --> 04:08.820
You do not approach women in a parking lot, like, yelling it.

04:08.820 --> 04:14.500
No male, no male should ever approach a woman in a parking lot, ever.

04:14.500 --> 04:18.040
No male should ever approach a woman in a parking lot, and if a male does approach you,

04:18.040 --> 04:22.600
you need to turn around and use the strongest voice that you can possibly use with them.

04:22.600 --> 04:23.600
Don't be polite.

04:23.600 --> 04:24.780
They need to literally screw off.

04:24.780 --> 04:26.520
No male should be approaching you in a parking lot.

04:26.520 --> 04:27.520
Wow.

04:27.520 --> 04:32.520
Okay, so I guess if a woman, you know, drops her wallet or something, guys, it's fair game.

04:32.520 --> 04:35.440
You can't approach women in a parking lot anymore for any reason.

04:35.440 --> 04:37.320
If you left her son behind in the cart, nope.

04:37.320 --> 04:38.800
You got to leave that kid there.

04:38.800 --> 04:39.800
Sorry, kid.

04:39.800 --> 04:41.800
It's a, it's a sexist for me to approach your mother.

04:41.800 --> 04:47.520
There are a thousand innocent reasons as to why you might go up to a stranger in a park,

04:47.520 --> 04:49.320
in a parking lot, and say something.

04:49.320 --> 04:51.280
To just immediately react like this.

04:51.280 --> 04:57.040
This is like, this is pure, I don't know what you, what you want to call it, like, it's,

04:57.040 --> 04:58.040
it's kind of schizo.

04:58.040 --> 04:59.680
It's not really conspiracy brain.

04:59.680 --> 05:04.960
It's just like, assuming that every single person has it out for you at all times.

05:04.960 --> 05:05.960
Sometimes they do.

05:05.960 --> 05:06.960
A lot of times they don't, you know?

05:06.960 --> 05:08.960
Oh, this one's an old one.

05:08.960 --> 05:10.960
You guys Americans?

05:10.960 --> 05:14.440
You guys here to spread sodomy or what?

05:15.440 --> 05:19.040
Isn't that what America's number one export is?

05:19.040 --> 05:21.320
So these are like American soldiers in Poland.

05:21.320 --> 05:23.480
Is it George Floyd culture or is it sodomy?

05:23.480 --> 05:25.280
George Floyd culture!

05:25.280 --> 05:28.080
Yeah, these are American soldiers in Poland.

05:28.080 --> 05:31.480
What do you guys think about your health secretary being a fucking tranny?

05:31.480 --> 05:34.960
Jesus Christ, dude, you're gonna get me fucking demonetized.

05:34.960 --> 05:41.000
So yeah, this guy is just like harassing random soldiers because they're soldiers stationed

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
in Poland.

05:42.000 --> 05:49.240
Defending a country that has, there's no meaning to be a citizen, like any, any Mexican crossing

05:49.240 --> 05:53.440
the border is literally one of you.

05:53.440 --> 05:57.640
Like regardless of his complaints, they're mostly stupid complaints too, but like regardless

05:57.640 --> 06:04.800
of any of them, what is harassing for anal sex to Poland?

06:04.800 --> 06:07.560
Like even he's laughing how dumb it is.

06:08.560 --> 06:12.760
Like, you're just bugging for random soldiers, dude.

06:12.760 --> 06:15.560
He's lucky they don't just like knock him out, you know?

06:22.560 --> 06:25.560
Jesus Christ, what a fucking asshole, dude.

06:25.560 --> 06:27.880
Dude, what a fucking asshole, man.

06:27.880 --> 06:31.160
Like regardless of how you feel about any of these issues, and in my opinion, a lot

06:31.160 --> 06:34.880
of his views on these things were just fucking stupid, but regardless of how you feel about

06:34.880 --> 06:40.320
any of these issues, man, harassing random ass soldiers, I guess that doesn't help your

06:40.320 --> 06:41.320
case.

06:41.320 --> 06:42.320
It doesn't help anyone.

06:42.320 --> 06:43.320
It just makes people fucking hate you.

06:43.320 --> 06:45.200
Oh, I remember this one.

06:45.200 --> 06:55.400
This was like woke cards against humanity and more kinky queers just needs less subconscious

06:55.400 --> 07:00.400
self sabotaging patterns and more magic mushrooms.

07:00.920 --> 07:03.920
Oh my god, guys.

07:03.920 --> 07:05.920
That's a really good one.

07:05.920 --> 07:08.920
Less being ghosted and more accountability.

07:08.920 --> 07:09.920
Wow.

07:09.920 --> 07:10.920
Oh my god.

07:10.920 --> 07:15.920
Less celery juice, more psychedelic.

07:15.920 --> 07:20.920
Less overthinking absolutely everything, more polyamory.

07:20.920 --> 07:22.920
Fucking hell.

07:22.920 --> 07:25.920
Less love and light, more tearing down the patriarchy.

07:25.920 --> 07:27.920
These are all really good.

07:28.440 --> 07:29.440
Oh yeah, guys.

07:29.440 --> 07:30.440
That sounds like a game that I want to break.

07:30.440 --> 07:31.440
You know what?

07:31.440 --> 07:35.440
I've only really played Cards Against Humanity like once or twice, and I didn't, like, not

07:35.440 --> 07:36.440
my kind of game.

07:36.440 --> 07:37.440
I didn't really like it.

07:37.440 --> 07:40.440
I can see why people like it, though, because there's some edgy cards in there, right?

07:40.440 --> 07:44.440
At least the original set, but like that just sounds un-fun.

07:44.440 --> 07:45.440
There's no edginess there.

07:45.440 --> 07:48.440
It's just constant reaffirmation of woke politics.

07:48.440 --> 07:53.840
Like, I don't know if you guys remember, but yeah, this is like going way back like the

07:53.880 --> 07:56.080
gamergate days, I think.

07:56.080 --> 08:00.680
But Cards Against Humanity, you know, for those of you who don't know, it has some really

08:00.680 --> 08:02.480
edgy cards in there, alright?

08:02.480 --> 08:08.920
There's some stuff that's like pretty grotesque, pretty over the line, definitely shock value

08:08.920 --> 08:10.600
humor in there, right?

08:10.600 --> 08:15.640
However, the creators of the game, like around the time of gamergate, came out and they went

08:15.640 --> 08:20.920
like full hardcore SJW in the gamergate era, and then they've gone like hyper woke since

08:20.920 --> 08:21.920
then.

08:21.920 --> 08:22.920
You know what I mean?

08:23.000 --> 08:27.720
Like all of their old problematic cards have been taken out of the game and replaced with

08:27.720 --> 08:28.720
shit like this.

08:28.720 --> 08:34.960
Okay, so the heading for this is, being a fat person in a skinny capitalist society.

08:34.960 --> 08:35.960
Oh, okay.

08:35.960 --> 08:38.560
I'm also a fellow fat, so lay it on me.

08:38.560 --> 08:41.920
Why don't they make things for fat people specifically?

08:41.920 --> 08:42.920
This kid ain't fat.

08:42.920 --> 08:45.000
Why aren't we included in shit, you know?

08:45.000 --> 08:49.760
I got a knee brace a while ago because I really, really, really need a knee brace because my

08:49.760 --> 08:51.400
knees are fucking awful, right?

08:51.400 --> 08:52.400
Because you're fat.

08:52.880 --> 08:58.080
You have to measure your calf and your thigh and shit like that so you can get the proper

08:58.080 --> 08:59.080
size, okay?

08:59.080 --> 09:00.840
Well, I got the proper size.

09:00.840 --> 09:05.120
I got the size that fits my knee of the knee brace, right?

09:05.120 --> 09:11.920
But they come with this little spandex knee sock thing, so you don't like hurt your fucking

09:11.920 --> 09:12.920
knee.

09:12.920 --> 09:18.960
You don't like mess up your skin and shit because it fucking hurts sometimes, right?

09:18.960 --> 09:20.960
Put a thought together, buddy.

09:20.960 --> 09:21.960
Guess what?

09:21.960 --> 09:25.120
The knee sock doesn't fit right.

09:25.120 --> 09:31.040
It rolls all the way down, and when I pull it up to where it needs to be, it's like he's

09:31.040 --> 09:33.040
wearing thigh highs.

09:33.040 --> 09:37.240
One size fits all only works if you're skinny.

09:37.240 --> 09:40.480
Fat people can't find cute clothes that fit them.

09:40.480 --> 09:45.360
Fat people can't get fucking knee braces that work correctly.

09:45.360 --> 09:47.480
Why do you guys hate us so much?

09:47.480 --> 09:50.680
What the fuck are we doing that's so wrong?

09:51.400 --> 09:52.400
I'm just a fat man.

09:52.400 --> 09:54.000
I'm just a fat guy.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
That's it.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
That's it.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
I'm just a fat dude.

09:57.000 --> 10:01.640
Why do you skinny people feel the need to, first of all, treat us like shit, and second

10:01.640 --> 10:07.320
of all, not fucking allow us to have things we need or fucking wear things we want to

10:07.320 --> 10:08.320
wear?

10:08.320 --> 10:12.280
There's a lot of fat people in the world, like a lot of fat people.

10:12.280 --> 10:16.600
It's a really common thing to be fat, and honestly, half the time it doesn't have anything

10:16.600 --> 10:19.280
to do with your eating habits.

10:19.280 --> 10:20.480
That's not true.

10:20.480 --> 10:21.480
That's fucking false.

10:21.480 --> 10:23.600
You know one of the big reasons people get fat because we're stressed out.

10:23.600 --> 10:24.600
You want to know why?

10:24.600 --> 10:25.600
Capitalism!

10:25.600 --> 10:29.600
It all comes down to capitalism!

10:29.600 --> 10:31.600
Oh my fucking god, guys.

10:31.600 --> 10:33.120
You're fat because capitalism.

10:33.120 --> 10:34.760
How retarded is that?

10:34.760 --> 10:36.200
I mean, you know what?

10:36.200 --> 10:37.360
Technically true.

10:37.360 --> 10:41.720
Capitalism's extreme wealth and abundance has made it so that food is actually hyper

10:41.720 --> 10:46.720
cheap compared to the way it was 1,000 years ago, and so poor people are actually more

10:46.720 --> 10:48.920
fat rather than starving and skinny.

10:48.920 --> 10:52.440
But no, the actual truth is, fat people aren't physically attractive.

10:52.440 --> 10:53.440
Not usually.

10:53.440 --> 10:55.160
I mean, hold on, it depends.

10:55.160 --> 10:58.160
There's some girls out there with fat in the right places, but you know what I'm talking

10:58.160 --> 10:59.160
about, right?

10:59.160 --> 11:03.080
It's not that they don't make cute clothes for fat people, it's that once you hit a certain

11:03.080 --> 11:07.320
level of fat, you don't look cute in any clothes.

11:07.320 --> 11:13.400
And if you're sitting here blaming your fatness on capitalism or stress, hold on, where fat

11:13.400 --> 11:15.480
is stressed, oh, does that mean you're eating?

11:15.480 --> 11:16.480
Stop fucking eating!

11:16.480 --> 11:17.900
Listen, I'm a fat guy.

11:17.900 --> 11:19.180
I know how much I eat.

11:19.180 --> 11:20.580
I know it's too much.

11:20.580 --> 11:22.860
I know what's causing this, okay?

11:22.860 --> 11:23.860
It is me.

11:23.860 --> 11:24.860
Oh shit!

11:24.860 --> 11:25.860
Antifa's out in the streets!

11:25.860 --> 11:28.860
Washington, this is like a pride march, not Antifa.

11:28.860 --> 11:45.860
Are they just like, yeah, they're just gonna block traffic, because fuck you, I guess.

11:45.860 --> 11:56.060
Like, imagine being this guy.

11:56.060 --> 11:58.120
You can't ride around in your car anymore.

11:58.120 --> 11:59.120
Fuck you.

11:59.120 --> 12:07.060
Look at this piece of shit, what the fuck?

12:07.060 --> 12:10.940
Trans lives matter, so we're blocking you from driving around!

12:10.940 --> 12:17.900
Like, what the fuck is this?

12:17.900 --> 12:23.900
Man, if you ever want people to like hate the trans movement, this is how you do it.

12:23.900 --> 12:27.340
You're just going along, you're driving to work, driving to the store or whatever, minding

12:27.340 --> 12:31.340
your own business, suddenly a bunch of these people show up and start banging on your car

12:31.340 --> 12:32.660
and screaming about transphobia.

12:32.660 --> 12:33.660
What the fuck?

12:33.660 --> 12:36.420
All right, after that, I need a palate cleanser.

12:36.420 --> 12:39.180
And hey, this lady's got something for us to drink.

12:39.180 --> 12:57.020
Oh my god, dude, okay, they're spilling it everywhere!

12:57.020 --> 13:03.260
What is this, like the wine ant anthem, where you have like 40 year old aged hipsters drinking

13:03.260 --> 13:07.540
wine out of mason jars, trying to get as drunk as possible because they're so desensitized

13:07.540 --> 13:09.580
to alcohol, their liver's already like shot.

13:09.580 --> 13:11.940
Jesus, this person's not very happy, are they?

13:11.940 --> 13:17.700
So Tristan and Andrew Tate are now in house arrest, which is not quite out of jail, but

13:17.700 --> 13:21.820
it's progress, which progress is good always, we take those.

13:21.820 --> 13:29.100
I send a voice note to both him and Andrew, honestly I'm just very happy that the truth

13:29.100 --> 13:35.700
actually eventually comes out, and it's just fucking unacceptable that all the, you know,

13:35.700 --> 13:39.980
forget the jail time, forget the time there, ultimately people like Tristan and Andrew

13:39.980 --> 13:42.140
will use this to their advantage.

13:42.140 --> 13:44.360
This guy's like hardcore simping.

13:44.360 --> 13:52.260
Now think about all these fucking worms and insects that spoke about them as if they committed

13:52.260 --> 13:57.580
the crimes they're being said they committed, without any proof, okay?

13:57.580 --> 14:02.340
And these people like Hasanabi, Destiny, I don't know what the truth is, I don't watch

14:02.340 --> 14:03.340
any of it.

14:03.340 --> 14:26.220
These guys, man, imagine simping for Andrew Tate this hard.

14:26.220 --> 14:28.580
Would you say they're Gusano?

14:28.580 --> 14:33.940
Dude, imagine sucking off the Tate brothers this hard.

14:33.940 --> 14:39.660
This guy's got like a full mouthful right up to the brim of Tate semen just slurping

14:39.660 --> 14:41.100
down right now.

14:41.100 --> 14:42.900
Man, who cares?

14:42.900 --> 14:46.740
I've done a few Andrew Tate videos, you know, it's a new story.

14:46.740 --> 14:49.960
I personally don't actually care that much.

14:49.960 --> 14:54.460
I don't know Andrew Tate, he's not part of my life, his business is not my business,

14:54.460 --> 15:00.460
he exists for me in so far as I can make videos, talk about a story, but for me personally,

15:00.460 --> 15:03.000
it doesn't actually matter.

15:03.000 --> 15:08.320
Imagine being a fanboy this hard, or hating him this hard too, like fuck.

15:08.320 --> 15:14.060
Just as you shouldn't simp for e-girls, do not simp for the Tates either, guys, alright?

15:14.060 --> 15:16.260
My half hour's nearly up, let's do one more.

15:16.260 --> 15:20.460
A short, attractive guy, or a tall, ugly guy?

15:20.460 --> 15:22.460
Tall, ugly.

15:23.460 --> 15:26.460
Who edited this?

15:26.460 --> 15:32.460
It's just a pause in her face, in the actual video, just a pause in her face, for real.

15:32.460 --> 15:34.460
Oh my god.

15:34.460 --> 15:42.260
Listen, lady, I hope you understand here, but the question was tall and ugly versus

15:42.260 --> 15:47.460
short and attractive, and the only thing I'll say is, you are neither tall nor attractive.

15:47.460 --> 15:50.660
Okay, that about does it for me for today, thanks very much guys.

15:50.660 --> 15:55.160
I'll be on admin stitch tonight, I think pretty much when this comes out, if my speed

15:55.160 --> 15:59.260
at editing is normal, so I'll see you guys over there.

15:59.260 --> 16:00.260
Have a good one, okay?

16:00.260 --> 16:00.760
I love you.
