00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,320
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:12,240
As you can tell by the different thumbnail of this video, I've decided to do these every

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,320
single day for the rest of my channel.

4
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,320
No, I'm kidding.

5
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,320
Obviously not.

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,880
I am going to do, maybe we'll do like TikTok Tuesdays or something because it's a video

7
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:24,960
that I can shoot easily, which frees up time for me to do other more in-depth projects.

8
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,960
For example, tonight I'm going on Adam and Sitch.

9
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,420
We're talking more Moldbug.

10
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:35,280
And so rather than doing a longer video and kind of painstakingly editing it together,

11
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,740
I can just slap this together in half an hour or so, maybe an hour at most for those busier

12
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:41,740
days.

13
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:43,580
I know some of you were saying, but Dave, you hired an editor.

14
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:44,580
Yeah, I know.

15
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:45,580
Guess what?

16
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:46,840
Dave's computer is actually broken too.

17
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:51,240
So hey, if you feel like donating an extra few bucks, maybe we can get things back on

18
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,240
the road again.

19
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:57,280
But anyway, I have collected a number of ridiculous things we may watch yet again.

20
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,760
Let's have some fun, guys.

21
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,200
And by fun, I mean, let's turn our brains into melted cheese.

22
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:07,800
If you want my future, I'm gonna get you fast.

23
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:11,800
If you wanna get with me, turn your face into a mask.

24
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:15,800
You're not gonna be wasting this precious time.

25
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:20,800
I'll get you in the dark and then commit this crime.

26
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,800
Don't tell you what I want, but I really want my soul.

27
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,800
I really want your soul.

28
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,800
Your soul.

29
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,800
Your soul.

30
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,840
Your soul.

31
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:29,840
Your soul.

32
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,840
If you wanna be a corpse, I'll bring it to my basement.

33
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:33,840
That's right.

34
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,340
I won't feel no remorse.

35
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:36,840
This has to be a joke.

36
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,840
Nothing lasts.

37
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,900
Dude, this has to be...

38
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,900
This has to just be a joke.

39
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:45,400
I mean, if it is, they got me, but...

40
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:51,320
Man, imagine the last thing you see is this person coming at you.

41
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,320
I want...

42
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,320
I want your soul.

43
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:56,320
This one's got no sound to it.

44
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:01,320
It just appears to be a bunch of people ransacking a fucking target.

45
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:04,320
Oh my God.

46
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,320
They're just stealing everything out of the target.

47
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,320
Like fuck it, we're just taking it all.

48
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,320
You keep seeing videos of...

49
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:16,320
See, I know some people say black people, it's not all black people, there's a white

50
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,320
woman doing it.

51
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:24,660
But like, I know you keep seeing these videos go viral of just constant, rampant, unending

52
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:31,420
theft, and no one cares anymore, no one is interested in being part of the social contract

53
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:38,540
anymore, no one's a decent human being anymore, and you know what?

54
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:41,100
These stores, they will eventually close down, right?

55
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:45,020
They can't just operate like this forever, they can't operate at eternal losses.

56
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:49,660
Eventually these stores will close, and then these communities will have nowhere to actually

57
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:52,540
get anything, and they'll just all be fucked.

58
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,540
What a shit show.

59
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:58,740
I'm literally shaking right now, because I just had a man approach me in a parking lot,

60
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:01,820
and it went fine, and I'm going to tell you why it went fine and how to address it, because

61
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:05,780
it was in a book I read, and this is how you're supposed to address it, but it scared me.

62
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,180
I'm literally shaking.

63
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:16,420
So this guy, I'm alone with my son, by myself, a woman, and a male approached me in a parking

64
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:17,420
lot.

65
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:20,380
He's like, excuse me, miss, and I don't know why in the hell he was approaching me or what

66
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:26,300
he was trying to do, and he was probably 30 feet from me when he said, excuse me, ma'am,

67
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:31,500
and I turned around, and I literally yelled at him, and I said, do not approach me.

68
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,500
What?

69
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:37,020
And he immediately started going in the other direction, and I just kept saying it over

70
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:38,020
and over and over.

71
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:45,180
I said, do not approach me, do not approach me, and he, of course, got like, what the

72
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:48,380
eff, like, he started cussing and yelling, like, what's your problem?

73
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:53,940
And I looked at him, and he started, he actually then crossed a couple cars down from my car,

74
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:56,100
and he didn't come anywhere near me.

75
00:03:56,100 --> 00:04:01,060
He crossed a couple cars down from my car, and was like, what's your problem, and I said,

76
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:03,300
you do not approach women in a parking lot.

77
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,440
I just kept saying, do not approach me.

78
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,820
You do not approach women in a parking lot, like, yelling it.

79
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:14,500
No male, no male should ever approach a woman in a parking lot, ever.

80
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:18,040
No male should ever approach a woman in a parking lot, and if a male does approach you,

81
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:22,600
you need to turn around and use the strongest voice that you can possibly use with them.

82
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,600
Don't be polite.

83
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,780
They need to literally screw off.

84
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:26,520
No male should be approaching you in a parking lot.

85
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,520
Wow.

86
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:32,520
Okay, so I guess if a woman, you know, drops her wallet or something, guys, it's fair game.

87
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,440
You can't approach women in a parking lot anymore for any reason.

88
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,320
If you left her son behind in the cart, nope.

89
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,800
You got to leave that kid there.

90
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,800
Sorry, kid.

91
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,800
It's a, it's a sexist for me to approach your mother.

92
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:47,520
There are a thousand innocent reasons as to why you might go up to a stranger in a park,

93
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,320
in a parking lot, and say something.

94
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,280
To just immediately react like this.

95
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:57,040
This is like, this is pure, I don't know what you, what you want to call it, like, it's,

96
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,040
it's kind of schizo.

97
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,680
It's not really conspiracy brain.

98
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,960
It's just like, assuming that every single person has it out for you at all times.

99
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:05,960
Sometimes they do.

100
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:06,960
A lot of times they don't, you know?

101
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,960
Oh, this one's an old one.

102
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,960
You guys Americans?

103
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,440
You guys here to spread sodomy or what?

104
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,040
Isn't that what America's number one export is?

105
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,320
So these are like American soldiers in Poland.

106
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,480
Is it George Floyd culture or is it sodomy?

107
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,280
George Floyd culture!

108
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,080
Yeah, these are American soldiers in Poland.

109
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,480
What do you guys think about your health secretary being a fucking tranny?

110
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:34,960
Jesus Christ, dude, you're gonna get me fucking demonetized.

111
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:41,000
So yeah, this guy is just like harassing random soldiers because they're soldiers stationed

112
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
in Poland.

113
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:49,240
Defending a country that has, there's no meaning to be a citizen, like any, any Mexican crossing

114
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:53,440
the border is literally one of you.

115
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,640
Like regardless of his complaints, they're mostly stupid complaints too, but like regardless

116
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:04,800
of any of them, what is harassing for anal sex to Poland?

117
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,560
Like even he's laughing how dumb it is.

118
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,760
Like, you're just bugging for random soldiers, dude.

119
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,560
He's lucky they don't just like knock him out, you know?

120
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,560
Jesus Christ, what a fucking asshole, dude.

121
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,880
Dude, what a fucking asshole, man.

122
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:31,160
Like regardless of how you feel about any of these issues, and in my opinion, a lot

123
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,880
of his views on these things were just fucking stupid, but regardless of how you feel about

124
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:40,320
any of these issues, man, harassing random ass soldiers, I guess that doesn't help your

125
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,320
case.

126
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,320
It doesn't help anyone.

127
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,320
It just makes people fucking hate you.

128
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,200
Oh, I remember this one.

129
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:55,400
This was like woke cards against humanity and more kinky queers just needs less subconscious

130
00:06:55,400 --> 00:07:00,400
self sabotaging patterns and more magic mushrooms.

131
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,920
Oh my god, guys.

132
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,920
That's a really good one.

133
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,920
Less being ghosted and more accountability.

134
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,920
Wow.

135
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,920
Oh my god.

136
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:15,920
Less celery juice, more psychedelic.

137
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:20,920
Less overthinking absolutely everything, more polyamory.

138
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,920
Fucking hell.

139
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,920
Less love and light, more tearing down the patriarchy.

140
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,920
These are all really good.

141
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,440
Oh yeah, guys.

142
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,440
That sounds like a game that I want to break.

143
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,440
You know what?

144
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,440
I've only really played Cards Against Humanity like once or twice, and I didn't, like, not

145
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,440
my kind of game.

146
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,440
I didn't really like it.

147
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,440
I can see why people like it, though, because there's some edgy cards in there, right?

148
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:44,440
At least the original set, but like that just sounds un-fun.

149
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,440
There's no edginess there.

150
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,440
It's just constant reaffirmation of woke politics.

151
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:53,840
Like, I don't know if you guys remember, but yeah, this is like going way back like the

152
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,080
gamergate days, I think.

153
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:00,680
But Cards Against Humanity, you know, for those of you who don't know, it has some really

154
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,480
edgy cards in there, alright?

155
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:08,920
There's some stuff that's like pretty grotesque, pretty over the line, definitely shock value

156
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,600
humor in there, right?

157
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:15,640
However, the creators of the game, like around the time of gamergate, came out and they went

158
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:20,920
like full hardcore SJW in the gamergate era, and then they've gone like hyper woke since

159
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,920
then.

160
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,920
You know what I mean?

161
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,720
Like all of their old problematic cards have been taken out of the game and replaced with

162
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,720
shit like this.

163
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:34,960
Okay, so the heading for this is, being a fat person in a skinny capitalist society.

164
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,960
Oh, okay.

165
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,560
I'm also a fellow fat, so lay it on me.

166
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,920
Why don't they make things for fat people specifically?

167
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:42,920
This kid ain't fat.

168
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:45,000
Why aren't we included in shit, you know?

169
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,760
I got a knee brace a while ago because I really, really, really need a knee brace because my

170
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,400
knees are fucking awful, right?

171
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,400
Because you're fat.

172
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:58,080
You have to measure your calf and your thigh and shit like that so you can get the proper

173
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,080
size, okay?

174
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,840
Well, I got the proper size.

175
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:05,120
I got the size that fits my knee of the knee brace, right?

176
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:11,920
But they come with this little spandex knee sock thing, so you don't like hurt your fucking

177
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,920
knee.

178
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:18,960
You don't like mess up your skin and shit because it fucking hurts sometimes, right?

179
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,960
Put a thought together, buddy.

180
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,960
Guess what?

181
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:25,120
The knee sock doesn't fit right.

182
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:31,040
It rolls all the way down, and when I pull it up to where it needs to be, it's like he's

183
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,040
wearing thigh highs.

184
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,240
One size fits all only works if you're skinny.

185
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:40,480
Fat people can't find cute clothes that fit them.

186
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:45,360
Fat people can't get fucking knee braces that work correctly.

187
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,480
Why do you guys hate us so much?

188
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:50,680
What the fuck are we doing that's so wrong?

189
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,400
I'm just a fat man.

190
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,000
I'm just a fat guy.

191
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
That's it.

192
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
That's it.

193
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I'm just a fat dude.

194
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,640
Why do you skinny people feel the need to, first of all, treat us like shit, and second

195
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:07,320
of all, not fucking allow us to have things we need or fucking wear things we want to

196
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,320
wear?

197
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,280
There's a lot of fat people in the world, like a lot of fat people.

198
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:16,600
It's a really common thing to be fat, and honestly, half the time it doesn't have anything

199
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,280
to do with your eating habits.

200
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,480
That's not true.

201
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,480
That's fucking false.

202
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,600
You know one of the big reasons people get fat because we're stressed out.

203
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,600
You want to know why?

204
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,600
Capitalism!

205
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,600
It all comes down to capitalism!

206
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,600
Oh my fucking god, guys.

207
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,120
You're fat because capitalism.

208
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,760
How retarded is that?

209
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,200
I mean, you know what?

210
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,360
Technically true.

211
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,720
Capitalism's extreme wealth and abundance has made it so that food is actually hyper

212
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:46,720
cheap compared to the way it was 1,000 years ago, and so poor people are actually more

213
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,920
fat rather than starving and skinny.

214
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:52,440
But no, the actual truth is, fat people aren't physically attractive.

215
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,440
Not usually.

216
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,160
I mean, hold on, it depends.

217
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:58,160
There's some girls out there with fat in the right places, but you know what I'm talking

218
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,160
about, right?

219
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:03,080
It's not that they don't make cute clothes for fat people, it's that once you hit a certain

220
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:07,320
level of fat, you don't look cute in any clothes.

221
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:13,400
And if you're sitting here blaming your fatness on capitalism or stress, hold on, where fat

222
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,480
is stressed, oh, does that mean you're eating?

223
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,480
Stop fucking eating!

224
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,900
Listen, I'm a fat guy.

225
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,180
I know how much I eat.

226
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,580
I know it's too much.

227
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,860
I know what's causing this, okay?

228
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:23,860
It is me.

229
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:24,860
Oh shit!

230
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:25,860
Antifa's out in the streets!

231
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:28,860
Washington, this is like a pride march, not Antifa.

232
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:45,860
Are they just like, yeah, they're just gonna block traffic, because fuck you, I guess.

233
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:56,060
Like, imagine being this guy.

234
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:58,120
You can't ride around in your car anymore.

235
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,120
Fuck you.

236
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:07,060
Look at this piece of shit, what the fuck?

237
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:10,940
Trans lives matter, so we're blocking you from driving around!

238
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:17,900
Like, what the fuck is this?

239
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:23,900
Man, if you ever want people to like hate the trans movement, this is how you do it.

240
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:27,340
You're just going along, you're driving to work, driving to the store or whatever, minding

241
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:31,340
your own business, suddenly a bunch of these people show up and start banging on your car

242
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:32,660
and screaming about transphobia.

243
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:33,660
What the fuck?

244
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:36,420
All right, after that, I need a palate cleanser.

245
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:39,180
And hey, this lady's got something for us to drink.

246
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:57,020
Oh my god, dude, okay, they're spilling it everywhere!

247
00:12:57,020 --> 00:13:03,260
What is this, like the wine ant anthem, where you have like 40 year old aged hipsters drinking

248
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:07,540
wine out of mason jars, trying to get as drunk as possible because they're so desensitized

249
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:09,580
to alcohol, their liver's already like shot.

250
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,940
Jesus, this person's not very happy, are they?

251
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:17,700
So Tristan and Andrew Tate are now in house arrest, which is not quite out of jail, but

252
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:21,820
it's progress, which progress is good always, we take those.

253
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:29,100
I send a voice note to both him and Andrew, honestly I'm just very happy that the truth

254
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:35,700
actually eventually comes out, and it's just fucking unacceptable that all the, you know,

255
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:39,980
forget the jail time, forget the time there, ultimately people like Tristan and Andrew

256
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:42,140
will use this to their advantage.

257
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:44,360
This guy's like hardcore simping.

258
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:52,260
Now think about all these fucking worms and insects that spoke about them as if they committed

259
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:57,580
the crimes they're being said they committed, without any proof, okay?

260
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:02,340
And these people like Hasanabi, Destiny, I don't know what the truth is, I don't watch

261
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:03,340
any of it.

262
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:26,220
These guys, man, imagine simping for Andrew Tate this hard.

263
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:28,580
Would you say they're Gusano?

264
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:33,940
Dude, imagine sucking off the Tate brothers this hard.

265
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:39,660
This guy's got like a full mouthful right up to the brim of Tate semen just slurping

266
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,100
down right now.

267
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,900
Man, who cares?

268
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:46,740
I've done a few Andrew Tate videos, you know, it's a new story.

269
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:49,960
I personally don't actually care that much.

270
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:54,460
I don't know Andrew Tate, he's not part of my life, his business is not my business,

271
00:14:54,460 --> 00:15:00,460
he exists for me in so far as I can make videos, talk about a story, but for me personally,

272
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:03,000
it doesn't actually matter.

273
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,320
Imagine being a fanboy this hard, or hating him this hard too, like fuck.

274
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:14,060
Just as you shouldn't simp for e-girls, do not simp for the Tates either, guys, alright?

275
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:16,260
My half hour's nearly up, let's do one more.

276
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:20,460
A short, attractive guy, or a tall, ugly guy?

277
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:22,460
Tall, ugly.

278
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:26,460
Who edited this?

279
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:32,460
It's just a pause in her face, in the actual video, just a pause in her face, for real.

280
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:34,460
Oh my god.

281
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:42,260
Listen, lady, I hope you understand here, but the question was tall and ugly versus

282
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:47,460
short and attractive, and the only thing I'll say is, you are neither tall nor attractive.

283
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:50,660
Okay, that about does it for me for today, thanks very much guys.

284
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:55,160
I'll be on admin stitch tonight, I think pretty much when this comes out, if my speed

285
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:59,260
at editing is normal, so I'll see you guys over there.

286
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:00,260
Have a good one, okay?

287
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:00,760
I love you.
