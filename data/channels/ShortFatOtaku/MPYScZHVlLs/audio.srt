Hey guys, no video today, sorry. Here's a quick update for you though. This channel has grown to

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:08,560
the point that I'm actually able to take on a full-time employee, finally. Before I had a couple

3
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:12,240
of people working part-time, but now it's actually become a real business, so that's pretty cool.

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,760
He's gonna be handing a lot of backend stuff, and the first thing he's doing is uploading the

5
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:22,000
entire catalog of SFO videos to Bitchute, Rumble, Odyssey, Dailymotion, and Brightion. That last one,

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,720
Brightion, is important right now, because I need 20,000 views across the Brightion channel over

7
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:31,440
there, to be able to unlock the ability to upload unlimited videos. So, if you feel inclined to help

8
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:35,120
out, please consider heading over to the Brightion SFO channel and rewatching some of your old

9
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:40,560
favorites. And, now that SFO is actually becoming a real thing, and not just me subsisting on

10
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,320
licking algae off the rocks, if you want to support the channel, please consider dropping

11
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:49,520
a tip over at the SFO subscribe star, Patreon, PayPal, the memberships button on the SFO channel,

12
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,760
or the subscription button on my gaming channel over on Twitch, Game Boomers. Any and all works

13
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,520
for me, so pick your poison. Thank you very much for contributing and supporting the channel.

14
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,440
Even if you can't contribute, that's okay too. Thanks very much for watching and being here.

15
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,440
It's been an amazing ride to 100k, and it'll be an amazing ride beyond it too.

16
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,800
I appreciate everything you've given me, and I'll keep working hard in return.

17
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,440
Alright, that about does it for me. Have a good day. I love you.

18
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:16,080
Also, yes, my assistant is Dave. It's this guy. It was always gonna be this guy.
