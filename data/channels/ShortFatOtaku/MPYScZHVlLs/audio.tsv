0	4320	Hey guys, no video today, sorry. Here's a quick update for you though. This channel has grown to
4320	8560	the point that I'm actually able to take on a full-time employee, finally. Before I had a couple
8560	12240	of people working part-time, but now it's actually become a real business, so that's pretty cool.
12240	15760	He's gonna be handing a lot of backend stuff, and the first thing he's doing is uploading the
15760	22000	entire catalog of SFO videos to Bitchute, Rumble, Odyssey, Dailymotion, and Brightion. That last one,
22000	26720	Brightion, is important right now, because I need 20,000 views across the Brightion channel over
26720	31440	there, to be able to unlock the ability to upload unlimited videos. So, if you feel inclined to help
31440	35120	out, please consider heading over to the Brightion SFO channel and rewatching some of your old
35120	40560	favorites. And, now that SFO is actually becoming a real thing, and not just me subsisting on
40560	44320	licking algae off the rocks, if you want to support the channel, please consider dropping
44320	49520	a tip over at the SFO subscribe star, Patreon, PayPal, the memberships button on the SFO channel,
49520	53760	or the subscription button on my gaming channel over on Twitch, Game Boomers. Any and all works
53760	57520	for me, so pick your poison. Thank you very much for contributing and supporting the channel.
57520	61440	Even if you can't contribute, that's okay too. Thanks very much for watching and being here.
61440	65440	It's been an amazing ride to 100k, and it'll be an amazing ride beyond it too.
65440	68800	I appreciate everything you've given me, and I'll keep working hard in return.
68800	71440	Alright, that about does it for me. Have a good day. I love you.
72480	76080	Also, yes, my assistant is Dave. It's this guy. It was always gonna be this guy.
