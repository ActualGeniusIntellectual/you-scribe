Hey guys, no video today, sorry. Here's a quick update for you though. This channel has grown to

00:04.320 --> 00:08.560
the point that I'm actually able to take on a full-time employee, finally. Before I had a couple

00:08.560 --> 00:12.240
of people working part-time, but now it's actually become a real business, so that's pretty cool.

00:12.240 --> 00:15.760
He's gonna be handing a lot of backend stuff, and the first thing he's doing is uploading the

00:15.760 --> 00:22.000
entire catalog of SFO videos to Bitchute, Rumble, Odyssey, Dailymotion, and Brightion. That last one,

00:22.000 --> 00:26.720
Brightion, is important right now, because I need 20,000 views across the Brightion channel over

00:26.720 --> 00:31.440
there, to be able to unlock the ability to upload unlimited videos. So, if you feel inclined to help

00:31.440 --> 00:35.120
out, please consider heading over to the Brightion SFO channel and rewatching some of your old

00:35.120 --> 00:40.560
favorites. And, now that SFO is actually becoming a real thing, and not just me subsisting on

00:40.560 --> 00:44.320
licking algae off the rocks, if you want to support the channel, please consider dropping

00:44.320 --> 00:49.520
a tip over at the SFO subscribe star, Patreon, PayPal, the memberships button on the SFO channel,

00:49.520 --> 00:53.760
or the subscription button on my gaming channel over on Twitch, Game Boomers. Any and all works

00:53.760 --> 00:57.520
for me, so pick your poison. Thank you very much for contributing and supporting the channel.

00:57.520 --> 01:01.440
Even if you can't contribute, that's okay too. Thanks very much for watching and being here.

01:01.440 --> 01:05.440
It's been an amazing ride to 100k, and it'll be an amazing ride beyond it too.

01:05.440 --> 01:08.800
I appreciate everything you've given me, and I'll keep working hard in return.

01:08.800 --> 01:11.440
Alright, that about does it for me. Have a good day. I love you.

01:12.480 --> 01:16.080
Also, yes, my assistant is Dave. It's this guy. It was always gonna be this guy.
