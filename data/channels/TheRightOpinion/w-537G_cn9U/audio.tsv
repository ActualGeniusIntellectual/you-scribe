0	11720	Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time, and the past.
11720	16560	It's a strange thing, and one that in times like these we probably long for more than ever.
16560	23060	Although I do relate to this sentiment more than you can possibly know, I likely wouldn't take anyone other than the person I am today,
23060	25560	minus the chronic health issues of course.
25600	31720	Yes, if we could transpose the current version of ourselves to past scenarios, then that's the choice that many would probably take,
31720	36000	it would likely save me and others from unnecessary disputes and distress.
36000	41160	However, at the same time, without many of those past scenarios, we probably wouldn't be where we are today.
41160	46760	In many ways, it's a paradoxical conundrum, and the best you can do is be thankful for your present wisdom.
46760	54240	As internet dwellers, we tend not to talk about our possibly tainted backstories too much, because other people have a nature to be quite judgemental,
54240	58240	and if that's not who we are today, then what right do people really have to know?
58240	63840	However, it's almost always important we keep the past in mind, because if not, we may be destined to repeat it,
63840	66640	and for many people, that's the last thing that we want.
66640	71200	With that said, there are some who will repeat it regardless, whether they know it's wrong or not,
71200	75600	and for those individuals, well, we may have to be a bit more vocal in how we reprimand them.
75600	81520	This is especially true if those individuals hold a relative amount of influence as, say, I don't know, a YouTuber,
81520	85920	with dedicated fans probably serving as a role model for a fair proportion of them.
85920	89120	What about when said drama involves your followers?
89120	91680	Well then, let's discuss today's topic.
91680	94000	Dude, this movie is f***ing amazing.
94000	95840	God, these 3D special effects are so realistic.
95840	97120	Look how realistic it is, man.
97120	98160	Yeah, exactly.
98160	100160	When does Eddie Murphy show up? That's all I want to know.
100160	102880	He shows up right f***ing now, 3D f***ing now!
102880	105600	Hahahaha!
105600	107600	Gamers unite, yes.
107600	112480	Once more, we are heading back to that corner of YouTube to set the backdrop for today's discourse,
112480	117040	and we'll begin by talking about one of the titans of the gaming community, Vanoss.
117040	119040	Vanoss- I was born in the darkness.
119040	121040	I was born a bat.
121040	125280	But I didn't see the light until I saw a new man.
125280	129680	And by then, there was nothing to be populated.
129680	133680	Hahahaha!
133760	135760	Come on, Bane, fight me like a man!
135760	137760	Combo breaker!
137760	139760	Who are you? I don't know!
139760	141760	Hahahaha!
141760	144640	That's not fair, Bane was low on health.
144640	152000	Evan Fong, also known as VanossGaming, is a creator who posts montage-style content of him and his friends playing a variety of video games.
152000	158960	On paper, it sounds fairly unexceptional, but the editing and interplay between Fong and his comrades has garnered widespread attention from viewers,
158960	164240	establishing his channel as a cornerstone in the YouTube gaming subculture that has flourished in the past decade.
164240	169920	On his channel, he would feature a retinue of creators who would aid that back and forth energy that buoyed his content.
169920	178240	This roster would evolve over the years, but one individual who became a pretty regular fixture on the channel during the mid-2010s was a gentleman by the name of Minilad.
178240	179840	We must save Minilad.
179840	180560	We have to save him.
180560	181120	What?
181120	183120	We are going to save you!
183120	184240	Yeah!
184240	185520	Thank God!
185520	186720	But first...
186720	187280	What?
187280	188880	Let's play with this new Batmobile toy.
188880	191040	Oh yeah!
191040	191680	Not now!
191680	192320	Yeah!
192320	193520	Not now!
193520	195440	Yeah!
195440	203840	Craig Thompson, aka Minilad, is a British creator who, like many others from his era, amassed success through videos where he indulged his gamer tendencies.
203840	208480	He set up his channel in 2011 while still in school, uploading mostly gameplay footage.
208480	215760	He quickly made inroads into the gaming community, even being featured as the gamer of the week in iHasCupquake's discontinued series.
215760	224560	Nonetheless, it would be a couple years before he would achieve any significant prosperity, with ratings being to pick up at the turn of 2013, after which point his channel rarely lost momentum.
224560	231520	In this time, Minilad also became rather involved in Vanoss Gaming's Banana Bus squad, named after a vehicle in Grand Theft Auto V.
231520	240960	This was mostly composed of Vanoss' inner circle of collaborators, including many other prominent creators such as H2O Delirious, Moose Knuckle, Louis Caliber, and I Am Wildcats.
240960	248160	With such an entourage, there was little doubt that Craig was certainly amongst the stars, and like many of his colleagues, his growth came quickly and substantially.
248160	253120	As he passed each million milestone with increasing finesse, it appeared that he had mastered his niche.
253120	254160	What niche is that?
254160	256720	Well, to be honest, I'm not entirely sure.
256720	263200	When looking up what people enjoyed about Minilad's content, I wasn't met with an overwhelming deluge of answers.
263200	268960	He was sufficiently inoffensive, decent at the games themselves, and did conceive some very original ideas,
268960	278000	but most of his accomplishments appear to be based on intelligent networking and a persistent upload schedule in an era where some creators do seem a little stale in hindsight.
278000	279680	There's too much Italian in here.
279680	287600	It's fine. It's fine. Keep your eyes on the sky. Keep your eyes on the sky, I'm not on my mustache.
287600	295200	Now, this isn't to his discredit. In many ways, Vanoss Gaming was the archetype of an extremely effective business model,
295200	298480	and the fact that other people wanted to recreate it made complete sense.
298480	306400	And like many of his colleagues, Minilad represented a clique of YouTubers that intelligently generated cyclical views through association and collaboration,
306400	308800	which overall has worked out quite well for them.
308800	312560	Whereas many gamers from that era may have fallen from their distinguished pinnacles,
312560	318880	a multitude of creators involved with these squads have managed to retain a consistent viewer base, even if it's not quite what it used to be.
318880	325520	Hell, in 2017, Minilad had one of the best years on his channel, capitalizing on the pivot to facecam and reaction-based content,
325520	328560	likely acquiring a fair few new subscribers in the process.
328560	332080	I never want to lose that connection with you guys, if you know what I mean.
332080	335360	And with that, I mean, I want to be able to, like, give back, in a way.
335360	339920	And that's why I want to go to all these conventions to meet you guys, and I want to do as many signings as possible,
339920	346560	and I want to meet you guys and spend the most amount of time with everyone, and I don't know, I'll forever be thankful for everything you lads have gave me.
346880	348800	It's just, life is a crazy ride.
348800	354640	Although Minilad's personality may not have been the most distinct, he was still held in high esteem by many within the community,
354640	357280	most notably for the numerous charity drives he had hosted.
357280	365200	For many, in a time where power seemed so prone to being abused, it was refreshing that there were still people like Minilad out there using their influence for the good of the world.
365200	372320	He was a board member on the, interestingly named, Thirst Project, an organization focused on delivering clean water to deprived communities,
372320	378480	also raising $150,000 over the space of two streams in 2018, very admirable indeed.
378480	384960	Nevertheless, it seems that Craig here still had a few steps to take to truly define himself as an individual creator.
384960	387360	These steps were mostly taken in 2018.
387360	394240	With his distancing from VanossGaming a couple years prior, the launch of his personal vlog channel, and undertaking of more ambitious ventures,
394240	398800	it looked like Thompson wanted to alter his trajectory and be the master of his own destiny.
398800	406240	As a creator, he had the capacity to stand on his own two feet, and no one who was going to impede this, no one other than himself, of course.
406240	412160	But what was the chance of that happening? I think we were all ready to see what the true Minilad was capable of.
412160	418000	He is so good at manipulation, it is terrifying, it is so scary.
418000	426240	But there were a few complications, and what one may have hoped to be a new beginning gradually manifested into a spiral back down one's past,
426400	429200	one that may not even be worthy of escape.
429200	435520	So, my friends, I invite you to join me on a voyage which has many uncomfortable yet unnecessary steps,
435520	440320	and I think we need to begin this endeavor as soon as we can. Let us go.
440320	458160	In the gaming sphere, Vanoss felt often like the root nexus, and with the applied formula to accumulate viewers between creators,
458160	462320	an association was often formed. When many thought of Minilad, they thought of Vanoss.
462320	468000	It can't be a surprise with Minilad's numerous appearances on the channel, in many ways it seemed to create an inalienable connection.
468000	472960	Nonetheless, Minilad wanted to be his own creator, but to what extent would he go to achieve this?
472960	478160	As aforementioned, one of the first moves that Minilad took to delineate his route was leaving Vanoss Gaming.
478160	485040	Now, in some senses, this was unexceptional news, he's not the first, and he won't be the last to leave a channel that has a rotating ensemble.
485040	491200	He stopped appearing in their videos regularly around the turn of 2016, but still appeared friendly with many of their members,
491200	493680	even releasing videos with them throughout the following year.
493680	499360	It was generally accepted, at the time, he had left for reasons that were related to how he viewed himself in regards to the channel.
499360	505040	He had spoken about this on Twitter previously, and seemed insecure on how some people perceived him as Vanoss' friend,
505040	511360	rather than his own person. However, given how involved he had been, there were obviously some who were going to be a bit taken aback.
511360	516640	Not everyone was going to be aware of the assumed reasons, and eventually questions began to arise.
516640	523520	As time passed, he appeared to fraternize with his former brethren less and less, and as distance grows, so will the volume of questions.
523520	527840	With some even memeing those who were curious regarding MiniLad's newfound independence.
527840	533120	Now, nobody was entitled to further explanation, I'm sure there were many instances where someone had asked,
533120	538320	and Thompson had chosen to ignore the eager Inquisitor. However, on one fateful day in 2018,
538320	543760	our Mini friend felt compelled to clear up any ambiguity hanging over the outstanding situation.
543840	549360	The only thing I want to ask is how? Come, you don't play with VanossGaming?
549360	554800	Wow, because I don't play Gmod anymore. That's all he does. Question done.
554800	558080	Also, I'm also breaking off into a solo YouTuber, because it's a lot more fun.
558080	564880	Now, Garry's Mod was a game that MiniLad had found decent traction with back in the day, but by this point, it had been popular for a long time,
564880	570320	and although a lot of people still played it, it was understandable you may be a bit burnt out on such a pastime.
570320	576080	Now, MiniLad's statement was a hyperbole, Gmod isn't all they play, but at the same time, the implication was clear,
576080	581120	that they didn't share the same interests anymore. This was certainly a surprise given the prior hypotheses,
581120	588480	and some may have found his tone a little hostile, but that can equally be frustration or exhaustion at the continued questioning of a personal decision.
588480	593440	At the time, MiniLad was one of a substantial number of people to distance themselves from VanossGaming,
593440	599120	which had led some to theorize about the imminent decline of the channel, with a few speculative claims here and there.
599120	606240	Still, no matter how close-knit the crew appears to be, there have been some events that caused, and are still causing, its downfall,
606240	611040	so today we'll be looking into 10 reasons why the Vanoss crew is potentially falling apart.
611040	617520	The foundation of the Vanoss crew was shaken when Craig Thompson, aka MiniLad, decided to stop playing with Vanoss,
617520	619840	and dissociated himself from the crew.
619840	627200	There was really nothing to supplement people's theories here, there had always been this slight tension between creators that had been picked up by observant fans,
627280	634400	but disagreements happened, people could still be friends, there was a bit of drama being stirred up, and MiniLad came forward to dispel those claims
634400	638320	and affirm that he and Vanoss were still friends, and there was no bad blood between them.
638320	644000	With this in mind, the case went cold, and their bond at least seemed cordial, but how long would that last for?
644000	653520	Well, let's fast forward to 2019, and MiniLad was streaming, as he often does, but once again he is sidetracked by the fact that Vanoss are still uploading Gmod videos,
653520	657200	prompting him to go off on a bit of a rant, with a tone of exasperation.
657200	664640	I also have no idea, they're still playing Gmod. Damn. For all this time, they're still playing Gmod?
664640	670880	I mean, they kicked me out of all their chats, so I have no idea what the hell they're doing, so they're still playing that, damn.
670880	677680	But okay, maybe I'd be a bit bothered if I was kicked from a chat with a bunch of people who I thought were my friends, it does seem a bit personal,
677680	680720	but MiniLad then has a few clarifications to add.
680720	690320	Just to clear up some shit, I wasn't kicked, all they did was play Fortnite and Gmod and then talk shit about other YouTubers, so I said fuck that.
690320	699440	I broke away from that group, I'm doing my own thing, I've never felt better, my community's stronger than ever, I'm pulling more views than ever,
699440	704320	and I'm personally a lot more happy as a human, so that's what happened. Anyways.
704320	709440	So he wasn't kicked, in fact, he left of his own accord, because he wasn't happy with the direction of the chats.
709440	716800	He decided to take a stand for himself, and now he is thriving, he's never been better, and you can tell it's true because you have his word.
716800	724640	However, many would've found it strange he was once more saying this after all this time had elapsed, but this is what happens when distance grows between individuals,
724640	729360	most latter perceptions arise from how you reflect on situations as opposed to how they happened.
729360	735600	With that said, if MiniLad only held fond memories with the Vanoss crew, it would be unlikely he would ever feel the need to malign them.
735680	743200	It once more seemed like the surfacing of previously latent resentment towards his former posse, one that may have been around for longer than many assume.
743200	749360	In 2016, before any of this drama transpired, a post was made titled Some Things You Should Know About MiniLad.
749360	759280	It's presented through the eyes of a follower of Craig and the rest of the Vanoss crew, and recounts a convention story where Mini appeared to be exhibiting some pretty seething jaundice for his popular colleague.
759360	767600	The fan writes that not too long after the meetup, they overhear MiniLad vocally tearing into Vanoss for appearing late, while also making further comments concerning his status,
767600	774480	including the claim that he didn't even like video games, and didn't start playing them until Call of Duty 4, the absolute noob.
774480	781600	This person obviously defends Vanoss for a plethora of reasons, and goes on to observe other instances where MiniLad has decried an aspect of Vanoss,
781600	787600	the banana bus squad, or their dynamic. They state that it seems to be a pattern of distaste that he has displayed for the crew,
787600	792880	and that others should be cautious as to the reliability of what he says due to the underlying animosity.
792880	800720	Now, this is just a personal account, however, it is aged rather well due to details we'll discuss in a bit, so I doubt it was written with the intent to mislead,
800720	810240	and it would explain past and present behaviour pretty accurately, so let's bring it back to 2019, and Mini's newfound groove in doing better than ever has clearly made him more outspoken.
811840	815840	That poor man's never gonna let that down, poor bastard.
815840	821840	And to an extent, it was true, MiniLad had rarely been more successful than where he was in April 2019.
821840	829600	It seems his confidence had reached a point where he was ready to disconnect from the Vanoss crew altogether, and this diatribe served as the severing blow.
829600	838480	However, with his remarks, MiniLad, by all intents and purposes, ended any possible good faith between the two parties that may make him hesitant to speak out.
838480	844800	Nonetheless, this was just an aside comment, what could tangibly follow from such an inconsequential statement?
844800	847680	MiniLad- Why isn't Craig in the server?
847680	849680	Well...
857280	862640	Trash Talk doesn't go too far in the gaming community, given that it's part of the culture in many ways.
862640	868640	Now, of course, this isn't just in-game swordplay, this was an individual pretty savagely laying into his former friends.
868640	874160	At the same time, this was a comment on a stream, not a formal upload loaded with serious allegations.
874160	877680	It wouldn't really warrant a belated response on its own basis.
877680	881760	Besides, MiniLad had made similar comments the year before, and nothing had come of them.
881760	887840	Drama between creators in a community that doesn't really have a desire for it is seldom beneficial for either party involved.
887840	893440	However, just because it's not beneficial doesn't mean it's not going to happen if someone feels inclined to express themselves.
895120	897120	MiniLad- I think I'm in the f***ing vlog movie.
897120	902480	Everyone laughs.
902480	904800	This is Terrorizer, or Brine.
904800	910080	He's a creator who has played with Vanoss and many of his associates, but is also in part known for his voice impressions,
910080	917920	which range from celebrities such as Arnold Schwarzenegger to composite characters like Asian Guy, a Vanoss favourite, I'm sure.
917920	925280	But I digress, he had previously collaborated with MiniLad on videos, appearing to be on friendly terms with Craig up until 2018,
925280	929760	when like many others associated with Vanoss, he stopped appearing on the MiniLad channel.
929760	935680	Now, MiniLad wasn't the only individual questioned over the ostensible disintegration of the relationship between two parties,
935680	940960	but until June he had been the only person to really speak about it, in a passionate way.
940960	945360	As noted, many creators involved with Vanoss strike one as rather drama averse.
945360	950160	This is not the first time conflict has arisen between one of their colleagues, I'm sure it won't be the last,
950160	956160	but few had sought to leave their input up until that point, likely knowing the risk of unnecessary quarrels.
956160	961920	Someone like Vanoss, known to be quite withdrawn from public life, would certainly not be compelled to defend himself.
962000	965920	However, in one June stream, facing questions once again from eager fans,
965920	971040	Terrorizer made the decision that actually, he wasn't going to hold back his feelings any longer.
971040	978320	Why isn't Craig in the server? Because he doesn't play with us anymore. He went off and left us, and then started badmouthing us,
978320	984720	so he doesn't play with us anymore. He can't have it every way, so we play with people who have not left our chat.
984720	989920	We have a chat, he left it, and he doesn't want to play with us. That's a question for him, not us.
989920	998720	Now, his comments don't exactly contradict those by MiniLad, however, his tone and phrasing demonstrate a clear disdain for what Mini had purported in his stream.
998720	1005920	However, as I'm sure he was aware, such a comment would not quell many supporters angst, and would almost certainly lead to more questions than answers.
1005920	1012640	Given the now noticeable tension between the two, people's curiosity persisted, and in August 2019, when asked again,
1012640	1019120	Terrorizer resolved to elaborate on his previously expressed sentiments, however, they didn't appear to be any more affectionate.
1019120	1029680	Why not invite Mini? I'll tell you why. He doesn't play with us. He left, and then he decided on stream to badmouth myself and my friends,
1029680	1038080	well, mainly just my friends, and I didn't appreciate that. So, I don't play with the guy lately, because he's going on his meme streams,
1038080	1042640	talking shit about us. It's not cool. So, that's why.
1042640	1049440	In spite of this, however, it seems that Terrorizer didn't want to talk about it much further, declaring that he didn't want to stoop to Craig's level.
1049440	1055840	I think he said something on the livestream about our girlfriends, which I think is a bit of a cop-out.
1055840	1071120	Well, it's not a fair conversation to have when another person's not here, you know? You guys coming to me, I could give you a very biased opinion on stuff,
1071120	1082400	but he went off, and he said some things on his livestream which really kind of annoy me about our group of friends and stuff,
1082400	1097440	and I'm just like, I don't know. I don't like people doing that. He said some stuff, and I don't want to resort to start saying stuff on my livestream about stuff.
1097440	1112160	So, with respect to you guys, I'm not going to do that, but I don't want to go into it, man, honestly. No disrespect to you guys, but it's none of your business.
1112160	1121760	Now, honestly, I do not know what level I'd class Craig's comments as. They're nothing too defamatory, but I suppose as the person who made allegations about the nature of Banos and friends,
1121760	1129760	there was still a bar set, and at that point, Terrorizer hadn't really done anything other than present his own version of events, and chose not to take it further,
1129760	1138400	which is fair enough, but unfortunately, Mini-Lad had other plans. Yes, on August 29th of 2019, Craig released a statement to Twitter,
1138400	1144080	with the intent to clear the air, however, this post doesn't exactly tell the story that we've seen so far.
1144080	1150080	He starts off by announcing the intent of this post, that being to address the rumours that he hates everyone he used to play with,
1150080	1156160	but clearly turns his attention to the visible friction between him and Terrorizer. Craig explains that this was in part because,
1156160	1165040	at the 2018 E3 convention, Brian made disparaging remarks regarding Mini's mental health, and then reinforced his comments in spite of Mini-Lad's discernible anguish.
1165040	1171120	Since he had not apologised, Mini-Lad no longer considered them on friendly terms. However, Craig goes one step further,
1171120	1177840	alleging that Terrorizer had been disseminating misinformation on his streams about how Mini-Lad was now at odds with much of the Banos fleet.
1177840	1183520	He rebukes this, and provides anecdotal evidence which contradicts this narrative, and affirms that he is still affable with Evan,
1183520	1188640	and many others who are active on his channel. Although Mini is unhappy at having to publish his thoughts on the matter,
1188640	1194000	he knows that people will be better off for being aware of this, and still wishes the best for Brian on his endeavours.
1194000	1199600	With this, he signs off, a testament to Mini's class and maturity, I'm sure we can all agree.
1199600	1203120	But wait, wasn't that something we missed?
1203360	1215920	Mini-Lad admitted some pretty essential details which are necessary to understanding how the situation precipitated.
1215920	1224080	That being, he was the person who chastised Banos in his own streams, with his comments implying that they were at best elitist and at worst rather petty.
1224080	1230960	For him to suddenly frame Brian as the instigator as if he had attacked Mini unprovoked is dishonest and pretty slimy on his behalf,
1230960	1234960	particularly given how it could have affected Terrorized's friendships with the Banos circle.
1234960	1241360	I also found it interesting how Mini-Lad was more comfortable referring to Banos as a collective now that he was no longer part of the channel.
1241360	1245200	Minor observations aside, why would he frame it in such a way?
1245200	1255600	Now, of course, the obvious answer would be to shield his image, however, as a seasoned creator, he must have been aware of the ramifications when people found out that he had twisted much of the information, right?
1255600	1267680	Well, not entirely, because at the time there wasn't really much of a clear record of what had been said, and Mini-Lad could have easily just passed the responsibility of rumours onto viewers who presented him with a one-sided portrait.
1267680	1279280	Now, in due course, a compilation of Mini's comments would be uploaded to one place, chronicling the saga in rather clinical fashion, but until then, although the evidence could be unearthed in certain places on YouTube,
1279280	1288720	it was often overrun by Mini-Lad's rather smart tone, the reasonable voice. He knew that many people wouldn't want to pick a side, so in spite of the gross misrepresentations,
1288720	1294640	many felt sympathetic to him and his point of view, seeing his recent tone as an indicator of good faith.
1294640	1305200	On top of this, many felt that his reasons for distancing himself from Terrorizer were valid, after all, it's just not right that someone make such comments about mental adversity pertaining to another person's life,
1305200	1313200	and as a long-term advocate for mental health, it was understandable that Mini would take offence to that, especially if Brian hadn't subsequently butchered on his position.
1313200	1316000	But was this the full story, either?
1323040	1332640	With the flaws in Mini-Lad's statement, Terrorizer was quick to respond on his Twitter account, firstly, quote, tweeting it with his own retort, expressing discontent at many of Mini's aforementioned misrepresentations,
1332640	1339280	while also drawing attention to Craig's recollection of comments Brian had made towards him, asserting that our gamer friend's portrayal was pure slander.
1339280	1345520	Mini responded shortly after, stating that it was a near-quote, once again affirming it was the reason that he stopped speaking to Terrorizer.
1345520	1352000	He then says that if Brian wishes to resolve it, then they can talk over DMs, after all, he wouldn't want a spat in public for all the fans to see.
1352000	1361520	However, Brian once more calls Mini out on this, observing the hypocrisy of making a call-out post accessible to the community, before requesting the discretion that he couldn't previously provide his former friend.
1361520	1366320	Then, in quite a surprising twist, another one of the Vanoss crew decided to impart their thoughts on the matter.
1366320	1369120	You know that group that Mini-Lad claims to be on such good terms with.
1369120	1375600	Well, it seems that Dahi Denogla was not ecstatic about Mini's behaviour, and in a reply, also called Craig out on his double standards,
1375600	1380640	contending that if he wants to talk it out in private, then he should delete his tweets, a fairly valid point.
1380640	1385920	Mini responds that Brian's point of view is already on YouTube, and people deserve to hear his side as well.
1385920	1393600	Dahi then responds, requesting this evidence, and unfortunately, as Mini has deleted his tweets, I'm unsure of whether he ever obliged and subsequently provided,
1393600	1398160	but whether he did or not, it wouldn't have changed the fact that Mini had instigated this long before.
1398160	1403600	Dahi and others were picking up on this, and applying a reasonable amount of pressure to good ol' Mr. Lad over here.
1403600	1410080	A lot of fans, however, were clearly upset and disappointed that two people who they both greatly admired were squabbling on their timeline,
1410080	1416160	and in these situations, the easiest way to yield a resolution is to take it to the DMs, and many advised them to do so.
1416160	1422160	A lot of the audience did not want to pick size, and I empathise with that greatly, as a fan, I would be upset as well.
1422160	1427920	However, this wasn't a case of differing perspectives, this was a situation where one person had greatly misrepresented another,
1427920	1434560	and although I tend to use words like slander a bit more carefully, it was still a very smarmy post that morally postures a fabricated position,
1434560	1439600	embedding itself in subtly self-aggrandising narratives to distract from its actual lack of content.
1439600	1444560	One of those being the narrative of mental health, a topic so close to Mini Lad's heart.
1444560	1451200	Now, if Mini was as concerned about mental health as he claimed to be, he'd be aware of how such a post could affect another individual,
1451200	1457040	their fan base, and their working relationships, and as we'll find out later, he does know exactly how it operates.
1457040	1462400	Now, if he was genuinely under the impression that Terroriser had said everything he had claimed to unprovoked,
1462400	1468800	then maybe, maybe it would have justified a response, but it's very hard to circumvent the fact that Mini started this world before,
1468800	1471280	and there was no way he could not have been aware of that.
1471280	1476400	Terroriser was clearly upset at these claims, and subsequently published a very comprehensive Twitlonger,
1476400	1478560	responding to Craig's initial assertions.
1478560	1485520	Turn of the Post explains his position in a way that we would expect it to, framing his comments as a reaction to Mini's in-stream overtodictor.
1485520	1493600	This is all fairly unextraordinary, we know what transpired here, however, one question mark still lingered over the nature of their running at the convention the year before,
1493600	1498560	the one where Mini Lad alleges that Brian had made rather deprecating comments towards his mental state.
1498560	1503280	Terroriser wholeheartedly repudiates this though, not just rejecting the idea that he had hectered Craig,
1503280	1506800	but recalling the times that he had supported Mini in his mental hardship.
1506800	1513600	He expands on why he hadn't responded to Mini's messages regarding them as mostly inconsiderate attempts to elicit an apology.
1513600	1521360	He talks about the quote, Mini's subsequent backtracking, and the hypocrisy of Craig's expectation of private resolution after making it public himself,
1521360	1526480	stuff we've also discussed, but having Terroriser's testimony backed up with the corresponding evidence
1526480	1532560	only further entrenched the idea that Mini Lad had purposely distorted the circumstances surrounding their ongoing conflict.
1532560	1537440	However, on top of this, it implicated Mini as not merely insensitive to much of what he claimed to hold dear,
1537440	1542240	but as weaponising it, in an attempt to damage the reputation of someone he had bad blood with.
1542240	1549360	It was rather tasteless behaviour, and whether his fans were on his side or not, he had likely shot himself in the foot with many of his colleagues and collaborators
1549360	1551840	who would evaluate the happenings with a more critical eye.
1551840	1557200	The whole situation is kinda sad to be honest, and Terroriser himself was clearly troubled by the disputes.
1557200	1574240	Mini would later claim the drama had been patched up in another video.
1574240	1590640	However, Bryan denied this and stated that he felt Craig had made these comments to appease audience members who may feel uneasy about the incident.
1590640	1614080	It's a strangely deceptive practice on his part, and although he would eventually release a semi-apology,
1614080	1619600	his handling of the situation, even in representing the reconciliation, seems surprisingly insincere.
1619600	1624400	Mental wellbeing is an important part of everyone's lives, I don't think I can emphasise that enough.
1624400	1630320	We are often taught to do what's best for ourselves, which although true, may not always mean what a person thinks it means.
1630320	1635680	Mini Lad has spoken profusely about the topic of mental health, and the challenges it had regularly posed to him.
1635680	1640160	He had made multiple posts alluding to it, and raised money for charities that operated in the field,
1640160	1644960	but this behaviour seemed to not just discard, but abuse these principles, begging the question,
1644960	1649520	did mental health really matter to him, or was it just a vehicle to help him further his status,
1649520	1653040	and was this behaviour even exclusive to the subject of mental health?
1653040	1661120	It's all good to try and fix something in DMs, and then it just leaves, then what about the people who still think I make fun of mental health and don't care and I did that to them?
1661120	1670800	It's not going to go publicly and say, hey, actually, look, you know, maybe I was wrong or something? No, no, that's that situation, that sucks.
1670800	1672480	Well, we would soon find out.
1672480	1686960	In the following months, Mini would continue his charitable endeavours and selfless ventures, winning plaudits and even awards from across the board,
1686960	1691520	but you wouldn't be blamed if you'd been left with a slightly sour taste in your mouth from what we just discussed.
1691520	1697760	However, at the end of the day, it was one drama, and regardless of what can be said about Mini Lad's demeanour under those conditions,
1697760	1703760	you couldn't use it to define his legacy, no, you'd need something much more substantial for that, and after such a skirmish,
1703760	1710320	Mr Thompson would probably want to stay as far away from drama as possible, but maybe his fate had already been sealed.
1710320	1719120	The past is a funny thing, time may age it in the mind of some, but in the internet era, its significance is often only as relevant as the awareness of its existence.
1719120	1723200	Therefore, when you acknowledge it, you are in effect making the past the present.
1723200	1730560	This principle is what has yielded, for example, the contentious cancel culture, because although individuals involved may have progressed past the instant,
1730560	1739840	when it's uncovered, many feel inclined to judge it in the current context of today's ecosystem, which can often be starkly different to the environment that prevailed all those years ago.
1739840	1746480	However, some actions have always been wrong, and will likely continue to be wrong for the rest of time as long as we can possibly conceive,
1746480	1753680	and the surfacing of such allegations will often lead a creator to being held to account, whether they would have preferred to leave it behind or not.
1753680	1761840	So let's bring it forward to the present year, where like many other people, our good friend Mini-Lad had been struggling, even taking a break at the start of the new decade.
1761840	1779280	At this time, Mini-Lad had went through a rather tough breakup with his now ex-girlfriend, Sami, or Suni Day.
1779280	1785280	This became quite an emotional affair, and led Craig to take a hiatus from social media and uploading altogether.
1785280	1791600	They had been in a relationship for approximately two and a half years, so it was rational for him to be a little distraught over such misfortunes.
1791600	1799920	He published a tweet on the 4th of January informing people of their split, before posting another a week later apologising for the impulsivity of the former,
1799920	1806640	and any superfluous distress that it spawned amongst those close to him. This is then followed by the hiatus, lasting just over a month,
1806640	1812880	with a video posted on his main channel to celebrate his long way to return, and reflecting on the reasons behind this respite.
1812880	1821280	I struggle a lot with mental health issues. It's not something to just kind of brush aside, it's something you need to take seriously,
1821280	1829280	otherwise it's gonna catch up with you, and that's exactly what happened. So I was on tour, I was rushing videos out, I was just putting up anything I could,
1829280	1839520	I wasn't proud of the videos I was putting up, I was just, TAKE THIS! And then I came back from tour, and then Sami and I broke up.
1839600	1847520	In the video, he talks a lot about the developments in the previous months, the most notable being the separation, which he presents as difficult but amiable.
1847520	1854720	He also takes the time to clarify some of the uncertainty surrounding the circumstances of the breakup, not that the audiences were entitled to know,
1854720	1860560	but it seemed to be a better option than letting people draw their own less lenient conclusions, and perhaps voicing them as well.
1860560	1888800	As long as these were details that the pair were happy with divulging, then as uploads go, it was a mature, informative piece which handled the sensitivities of its subject with care and diplomacy,
1888800	1895440	and many paid him the due respect that such conduct would warrant, while respecting his will to share as much as he felt comfortable sharing,
1895440	1897680	this was the right time to clear the air.
1897680	1905920	I'm excited for this year! I can't tell you, I can't, but just trust me, this year's gonna be amazing.
1905920	1912640	Over the following months, Mini returned to his regular upload schedule, releasing the quality content that quenched his audience's desires,
1912720	1919840	however, there was trouble on the horizon. What did this trouble entail exactly? Well, let's go back to the old 2016 Tumblr post,
1919840	1924320	you know, the one that recounted MiniLad's slightly less than professional behaviours with Vanoss.
1924320	1930480	In the penultimate paragraph of the post, while continuing to document evidence of MiniLad's strained relationship with the Vanoss crew,
1930480	1936800	the author also observes that they had seen a pattern of Craig mingling with younger, and dare I say it, underage fans.
1936880	1941280	They say this isn't anything incriminating on its own, but it's worth noting given the trend.
1941280	1945840	With that said, this wasn't the first time that he had received a flack for his interaction with his fans,
1945840	1953760	in fact, in January of 2016, Mini partook in an exchange with the infamous Keemstar over comments he had made towards another Twitter user in the DM.
1953760	1961600	This was during Keem's internet crusade phase, which led to a lot of allegations, sometimes correct, sometimes not so correct,
1962240	1968400	so people took what he was saying with a pinch of salt. At some point after this, Keemstar deleted the tweets, and nobody archived them,
1968400	1977440	so I didn't think I was going to find anything here. However, I am a tenacious man, and I found some of the interactions alongside one tweet with the images in question,
1977440	1983920	and I must say they are something else, given that once again, this individual was alleged to be an underage fan.
1983920	1991680	I'll add alleged, his behaviour seems unbelievably inappropriate, framed through the lens of helping this person.
1991680	1998560	Ahaha, no don't be sad, you have nice boobs. Somehow he got off the hook here.
1998560	2006080	I think because people would be occupied with other controversies such as Lie Maker, Keemstar himself ended up in a controversy after running the infamous R.S. Lauren Gold story,
2006080	2012320	overshadowing many other situations at the time, and Mini's dismissive responses clearly worked in subduing any public arousal,
2012320	2020000	and he lived to fight another day. Nonetheless, it was clear that not everyone was ignorant to Mini's occasional improper fraternisation with younger audience members,
2020000	2026000	and although these rumours ever nested in the years succeeding, there was likely a suspicion that lingered within the pockets of the internet,
2026000	2030560	and come 2020, much of that misgiving would prove not entirely unfounded.
2030640	2039200	So let's bring back Craig's ex, Suni Day, of whom Mini had a rather extensive relationship with. In mid-June, the mistreatment and harassment of female Twitch streamers
2039200	2047040	became a pretty prevalent discussion in many online circles, and as a female Twitch streamer and victim herself, Sammy decided to impart her insight on the matter,
2047040	2055200	completely acceptable. However, this alarmed Craig, as from his perspective, given their rich history, many would assume that he was the person Suni was referring to,
2055200	2061360	and thus he anxiously reached out, requesting that his former partner clarify that he had not violated her in such a way.
2061360	2069600	Suni obliged, but in turn adding the caveat that this did not absolve him from other misdeeds that were present, including lies and manipulation,
2069600	2078880	even sharing some DMs, which although do not say too much on their own, certainly don't paint the split as friendly and mutual as Minilad had communicated in his video.
2079040	2088240	Yes, in clearing up one ambiguity, this tweet had revealed information that would inspire others to speak up, with much more damaging implications.
2088240	2098400	So allow me to introduce you to two individuals, this is Hallie, and this is Ash. Both of them were fans of Mini, and both have publicly confabulated with the YouTuber on numerous occasions,
2098400	2106400	Ash until the end of 2017, and Hallie right up to 2020, the latter having consistently lent her support to Craig in his online pursuits.
2106400	2111760	However, it seems that their experience with the award winning creator had a bit more background than one may expect,
2111760	2119440	and on June the 22nd, following Sami's all revealing tweets, both took to my favourite social media site to share their stories.
2129440	2134640	Publishing via Twitter longer again, Ash and Hallie lay out their less than stellar encounters with the creator,
2134640	2140240	alleging multiple accounts of improper behaviour with them, not just as fans, but as individuals who were not of age.
2140240	2150080	Now, this wasn't already the best look for our friend, however, it didn't stop there, in fact, it was barely the beginning, and that's not good when you're already 11 pages into a script.
2150080	2158320	Now, these stories tell a tale we are all too familiar with on this channel, presenting Minilad as a person who, burnt by the then recent collapse of another relationship,
2158320	2163040	turned his attention to those online to fill a void, specifically those from within his fanbase.
2163040	2170320	In this instance, the implication is that he specifically targeted younger fans, knowing their vulnerability, and the power he held over them as a creator.
2170320	2180240	We can't provide too many specific dates, but this appears to have transpired throughout 2016 mostly, and around the time he was reported on the Tumblr post to be socializing in many of these circles.
2180240	2185600	It's also alleged he had used his power to bargain for explicit content, which few would already condone,
2185600	2194240	but is particularly objectionable considering that Hallie and Ash were both around the age of 16 or 17, not being of legal standing to send such content in the first place.
2194240	2200560	However, these are elementary testimonies, and although it would be easy and justified to call Minilad out for such debauchery,
2200560	2206000	something that I will have no qualm in doing, I'd like to evaluate a few more details that would catch one's eye.
2206000	2212480	However, to take this discussion forward, or to even work from the premise of truth, we'd need a bit of substantiation behind these claims.
2212560	2220240	But Ash and Hallie were well equipped, dropping screenshots of DMs from multiple platforms, covering various points in their contact with the gaming icon.
2220240	2226800	In their Twitlongers, both individuals appear quite convinced that Minilad was consciously taking advantage of them for his own purpose.
2226800	2234320	Now, the word conscious there is pretty pivotal in the construction of that sentence, Minnie was not going to be treated gently with these revelations regardless,
2234320	2237520	but to be frank, the actual evidence made him look even worse.
2237600	2244000	Firstly, we'll turn to Ash, who released a series of screenshots dating from around the time where much of this misconduct is said to have occurred.
2244000	2248480	This not just helps in corroborating much of their assertions, but also many of the judgements.
2248480	2257520	Minilad's behaviour may merely be unbefitting in some, such as his messages to the group chat, but look beyond that and you'll see some pretty repulsive and manipulative behaviour,
2257520	2261920	which clearly shows Minnie's awareness of the rift in power between the two parties in question.
2261920	2268640	Probably the worst conversation captured is this one, where Ash clearly shows reluctance to share explicit images, understandably so,
2268640	2272880	and Minnie begins to encourage her in the way that a mentor would one of their students.
2272880	2278000	You can do it. I believe in you, take the leap and send me nudes.
2278000	2283440	It is preposterous, if someone doesn't feel comfortable, you respect that boundary, and as outlined in the Twitlonger,
2283440	2288320	this is not something that they would have done if it wasn't an individual with the clout that Minilad has,
2288320	2295200	and to me, it seems that Minnie was quite aware of this. It also doesn't help that Minnie holds what a person said when they were drunk over them,
2295200	2302640	as if it was some kind of ironclad pact. He also guiltbaits by saying that he's sad, which is another thing I've never been a fan of in general,
2302640	2310800	because it shows a lack of consideration for how the other person may feel. In certain circumstances, I can understand how it could be read in banterous fashion,
2310800	2318240	but not when it deals with the exchange of such matter. This is not mutual, it's nasty, coercive, and shows a prioritisation of personal
2318240	2324400	gratification over respect for the other party's autonomy. This is also supported by much of the individual testimony,
2324400	2329120	which focuses on how Minilad regularly used his depression as a means to acquire what he desired.
2329120	2335040	There's every trick in the book here, and I want you to keep this in mind going forward, not that it would be easy to forget.
2335120	2340880	There are multiple DMs on multiple platforms, and messaging services with the individuals involved that support these claims,
2340880	2347360	involving both parties where Minilad has sent and received explicit images, alongside video verification confirming the accounts
2347360	2354240	belonged to Minilad. This was already compelling. In a way, though, Minilad's 2016 antics were only half the story,
2354240	2359920	because when word of his behaviour began to make its way through these smaller communities, many sought to suppress these testimonies,
2359920	2365760	including Minilad himself, employing a plethora of strategies highlighted in screenshots posted by Hallie.
2365760	2372160	In these images, dating from the end of 2017, Hallie decides to confront Minnie about Ash, and the nature of their relationship,
2372160	2377920	asking some exploratory questions to gauge their connection. In his responses, Craig downplays any intimacy,
2377920	2383120	preventing inferences from being drawn regarding the content of their conversations. However, a few days later,
2383120	2388880	the tone of this discussion had shifted, and Minnie is pleading with Hallie to prevent this information from being publicised.
2388880	2396160	My favourite line here is when he says that there was nothing more than a specific message, before adding, and maybe a bit more of similar,
2396160	2403920	just to cover himself in case there were some additional exchanges exposed. Who knows, maybe there was? I don't know.
2403920	2411200	How would Minnie know? He barely remembers who Ash is. Hallie frames a lot of this dialogue as manipulation on Minnie's behalf,
2411200	2417440	and it's quite easy to see why. With the threat of incriminating evidence being released, he appeals to a lot of the consequences
2417440	2423840	that he will face. Now, his line of reasoning isn't incorrect here, there will be significant ramifications if these details
2423840	2429200	were to be dispersed, and he has a right to be worried about that, but it's an observation, not an argument,
2429200	2435280	and it can't really be used as a point against the publication of such content. Hallie makes it clear that she's aware of the
2435280	2441120	consequences, and Minnie reiterating again and again how awful it would be for him just seems to be an attempt to take
2441120	2446560	advantage of the good faith that Hallie shows him, and the sympathy that she may feel for the remorse he expresses.
2446560	2452480	This is a technique that is applied on multiple occasions when discussing the issue. A few days later, Minnie was caught in
2452480	2458080	another lie. When sent a screenshot from a snapchat conversation, he admits that he is one of the participants, but then
2458080	2465040	proceeds to claim that Ash had lied about her age. That would be a decent rebuttal if it was the truth, which it wasn't,
2465040	2471000	and a few days later, Hallie challenges Minnie once more on this fact, and this time he buckles, admitting that he knew she was
2471000	2480040	17, but that he was really depressed, and that he just thought if he was gonna end it there, he was gonna go out in a blaze of glory with lewd snapchat DMs.
2480040	2489680	Wow, real kamikaze mission there, Craig. It was rather desperate stuff on Minnie's part, however, Minnie Lad wasn't the only person attempting to conceal his wrongdoings.
2489680	2496280	In fact, some of the mods from his Discord server decided to take it upon themselves to defend their King's honor, some adopting the
2496280	2502640	there will be repercussions argument, others claiming that he had changed, both points of view espoused by Minnie Lad himself.
2502640	2509160	I found a lot of these explanations quite embarrassing given the additional context. With that said, it was clearly effective, as no one
2509160	2517680	ousted him publicly at that time, and many clearly did believe that he deserved a second chance. However, that second chance was all used up by the time
2517680	2524280	that Sun Yudai had informed the internet that Minnie Lad's antics were still prevalent throughout their relationship, which is what inspired
2524320	2531080	Ash and Halle to share their stories. Over the years, he had continuously pledged to improve, to seek help, and as it became clear that he had
2531080	2538960	merely used their pity to preserve his public image while not actively changing his ways, their charity had diminished, and this was the breaking point.
2538960	2545800	Beyond that, this was their ultimatum to Craig, and Minnie Lad could no longer postpone his judgement day.
2545800	2561160	Both Ash and Halle clearly had extremely unpleasant experiences with the creator at the centre of this debacle, but there's a real poignancy
2561160	2568240	in particular to Halle's testimony, because it's clear that she wanted to believe that Minnie had changed more than anyone else, and that really,
2568240	2575440	the most frustrating facet to her were all the lies that followed the scenario which she had taken at face value. She gave Minnie an opportunity
2575480	2582480	to improve, she provided her support to his endeavours, and he took advantage of it. These were their stories to tell, and they didn't tell them
2582480	2588880	with the intent to destroy his career. If they had felt Minnie had changed his ways, then I think they probably would have let him be.
2588880	2596320	However, to them, with the discovery that this behaviour had been present in his most recent relationship, even being instrumental to its demise,
2596320	2603440	it was more than ample evidence that his word could not be trusted. With it out in the open, Minnie Lad would have to convince a much less
2603440	2610240	sympathetic internet that he would rehabilitate himself, a harder sell for sure, and many who read the allegations didn't see a way back
2610240	2617280	for Minnie at all. To them, this was unforgivable, and to be honest, it's hard not to see it from that viewpoint when you look at how he
2617280	2624960	manipulated those around him. How could we trust what he says to anyone past this point if he can't even be honest with those closest to him?
2624960	2631360	Well, to be honest, the only way would be if he had actually practiced what he preached, and with the allegations garnering traction,
2631360	2638200	Minnie had no other option but to address them, releasing a statement, accepting full responsibility for his actions, and unreservedly
2638200	2645600	apologising for the hurt that he caused. Nonetheless, that was the easy part. It was going to be challenging for Minnie to deny the allegations
2645600	2652720	at this point given their substance, and even from a strategic standpoint, it was the sensible thing to do, so a confession doesn't warrant too much
2652720	2659600	kudos here. What really mattered were the steps that he was going to take to make amends. In Halley's Twitlonga, she said that she legitimately
2659640	2666840	thinks Craig is a good person, and that she really just wants him to take ownership of his actions, to seek help, to stop running, and lying to his audience.
2666840	2674000	The message was clear, and in his response, it seems that Minnie was receptive to this, committing to an indefinite hiatus, and using that time to build back
2674000	2681440	the trust of those he wronged. Now, of course, many were hesitant to buy into the sincerity of such a pledge, and with valid reason, but at the same time,
2681440	2687440	it was probably the best we were going to receive, and if he could at least heal some of the wounds that he had inflicted to those in question,
2687480	2696240	then that would be progress. Many people adopted this perspective, and wanted Minnie to be better, which is very merciful for the internet that I know.
2696240	2703920	So, what would Craig do with this time away? How would he use it to win back the faith lost from many disillusioned followers, and even friends?
2703920	2712320	Craig- Hi, how's it going? Hope you're doing good. First thing you probably notice is the background. I'm back in my old studio.
2712360	2719840	Well, turns out his break lasted shorter than one might anticipate. In fact, it was on par with the post-war break he took at the start of the year,
2719840	2726960	and most of this intermission appeared to be occupied with relocating back to Northern Ireland, which is also peculiar given that he'd already moved once
2726960	2730400	at the start of 2020. However, there was an explanation for this.
2730400	2740840	Craig- I went on this mental health journey, I realized that there's a lot going on in the world, and I know I just need to step away, and I know I just need to take care of myself.
2741720	2751160	My mental just took a turn for the worse, and I know I needed to get back. I needed to be around the ones who I love. I wanted to work on myself, my mental health journey.
2751160	2760040	I got myself into therapy for the last month, and it's been incredible. It really has. This has been something I've been putting off for years because I wanted to make sure work was okay,
2760040	2766520	and I kept up at work, and I just put myself on the back burner, and it made me finally realize that I can't do that anymore.
2766520	2776920	But it's been nice reconnecting with my roots, reconnecting with who I am, where I grew up. You know, I moved to Northern Ireland when I was 10, 9, 10 years old,
2776920	2787480	from whenever I was living in Singapore. I came over here, and this has been the place that I call home. I know I just left all of a sudden, but I just, I needed to do something about me.
2787520	2798560	Right, of course. Going back to his roots to clear his head, this mental health break had clearly revitalized him, and he was ready to start creating content again for his adoring audience.
2798560	2815320	Wait, didn't something happen? Oh right, yeah, he doesn't really talk about that. Like, at all. In fact, we are met with a 5 minute long slew of rhetoric about how important it is to take care of one's mental health,
2815320	2824200	that he's not perfect, he needed the time out to work on those imperfections, and that he's been improving himself with every passing day. How inspiring.
2824200	2830280	Like I said before, I'm back in therapy, and she has been incredible, being able to spell everything onto her, and-
2830280	2833120	Might want to reconsider the wording on that one, Craig.
2833120	2842280	Even though this is my first video back, this doesn't mean that I'm gonna just stop working on myself. I've come to realize that the journey of working on yourself isn't just,
2842320	2853960	I'll do it for a few months, and I'll be alright. It's a journey that never truly ends. As humans, there's no definitive amount of time that if you take this amount of time away and work on yourself, you'll be okay again.
2853960	2867160	The reality is, this is a journey that myself and all of us are just gonna continue to go through life, and you know, I've come to the realization that I'm never- no one is ever perfect.
2867160	2877160	People, you can strive for perfection, but as long as you know that no one is perfect, and no one will ever be perfect, the more you realize that, the better you're gonna be.
2877160	2884880	In summary, he completely avoids disclosing the reason why he took the hiatus in the first place, and decides that his viewers are better off not knowing.
2884880	2892760	The break was already insultingly short for someone of his status, he could've afforded to take much more time away from the platform that he had misused,
2892760	2902200	but even if we discount that, the fact that he doesn't even have the humility to be honest with his own audience is more than enough evidence that he hadn't learned from his misconduct.
2902200	2909440	He also posted a similar statement to Twitter, which although was less offensive given the fact that his previous apology was also just below it for context,
2909440	2916160	still completely neglected to address any reparations that he had made for his misdeeds, let alone the misdeeds themselves.
2916200	2923320	It was shady as hell, and almost implied that he had this expectation that it would just blow over if he didn't mention specifics.
2923320	2934320	I have receipts, and I'm gonna show them again, like maybe right here, where he was talking to his moderators about how in modchat, people are gonna see that this doesn't matter,
2934320	2939880	and it's gonna die, just gonna- he'll upload in a week, it'll be fine, nobody's gonna care.
2940880	2952080	You have to be some scumbag, some scumbag with a high enough ego to think that people in your discord, moderators who looked up to you,
2952080	2958560	are not gonna share those messages with me, who are just gonna let that slide, now.
2958560	2967680	Well, actually, it seems that's exactly what he expected after chat logs were sent to Halley, in which he states that once people realise that the majority of people don't care,
2967680	2974400	or don't know, and the brands continue to work with him, it'll all blow over, which is some high-grade arrogance on Minnie's front.
2974400	2981800	Much of this is revealed in a video uploaded by Halley, which served in part as a response to Sir Ladalot's glorious return to YouTube,
2981800	2988600	but also as means to provide her story across all platforms, and to make sure it wasn't overshadowed by Minnie's influence.
2988600	2995240	However, there are more than enough new developments which only tarnish his image further, some to astounding degrees.
2995800	3007680	She basically was told by Craig to go to Ash, one of the other girls who came out, who dealt with way worse, way worse,
3007680	3020720	to tell her about his suicide attempt, to make her feel some sort of pity, and then was saying to me, which you'll see now,
3020720	3030640	just how, if Ash ever came up about this, she would be killing, she would be the person who's responsible for killing thousands of people,
3030640	3038640	because if people found out who he was, and fans who count on his videos found out about him, they would kill themselves.
3038640	3047480	It is unbelievable the audacity of this man. So many of his leaked DMs didn't paint him as a person who wanted to know what he could do to atone for his actions,
3047520	3055720	but more what he would do if such evidence went public, it doesn't reflect remorse or regret, and Halley's video once again showed how manipulative
3055720	3063160	his hiatus and return had been, yet this time round, it wasn't even subtle, he was basically seeing what he could get away with.
3063160	3070760	It was a sign of an inflated ego which judged his fans as too stupid to hold him to account. On top of this though, it made his utilisation of points
3070760	3078120	surrounding mental health seem unbelievably contrived, and brought into question whether he ever believed anything that he said about it.
3078120	3094600	I appreciate every content creator that came out and spoke and just came out and shared my story, because he is getting away with this pretty easily.
3094600	3101640	His viewers, a lot of them do not know what's going on, it's not their fault.
3101640	3107880	Thanks to Halley's response, and other YouTubers covering the situation, publicity of me's antics began to amplify.
3107880	3115880	It became quite clear that he wasn't going to distance himself from the incidents like he had hoped, and he may have no other option but to talk about them.
3115880	3120760	But how would he with such damning receipts against him? Well, let's find out.
3120760	3144600	How much of a massive ego can you have? How much of a fucking disgusting human being can you be, to think you have a right on this platform?
3145560	3154040	With his first video back, it was initially received decently by those within his committed fanbase. However, with the limelight firmly on his transgressions,
3154040	3162280	the backlash began to augment into its own movement, with its purpose to remove Mini from the platform altogether, and to make him pay properly for what he had done.
3162280	3169720	His videos began to accumulate thousands of dislikes, as well as critical comments, ranging from disappointed devotees to outraged onlookers.
3169800	3171960	There was no way he could filter this out.
3183960	3189880	He would upload another regular video some 12 days later, without any recognition towards the mounting pressure against him.
3189880	3199240	However, this was met with even greater hostility from viewers than the previous release, and was indicative that he wasn't simply going to be able to escape this without offering up some explanation.
3199240	3205720	So come September, there was a new task on the Mini-Lad agenda, and that was to clear the air.
3205720	3212680	Now, he had done a similar thing with his upload, addressing the separation with Sammy. In hindsight, that video was also flagrantly dishonest,
3212680	3220920	but at a time where people were none the wiser, it served as a sufficient explanation for where he had been, and the tribulations that he had faced during this period.
3220920	3227240	This time around, the air was significantly murkier, and there was a lot of seemingly conclusive evidence to confront,
3227240	3234680	that even the most eloquent of individuals would have difficulty excusing. However, with few other options, Mini had to put his cards on the table.
3234680	3238840	But was he holding all the aces? Well, no.
3238840	3246280	Mini-Lad- Hey guys, I wanna talk about a lot of the stuff that's been going on online lately, whether it's through YouTube, or Twitter, or places like that.
3246280	3256920	I've been reading a lot of your guys' comments as well, and I wanted to formally address everything, but as well as address everything, I wanna talk about a lot of the rumours that are out there, and debunk some of them too.
3257000	3265800	The video is five minutes long, which is already quite brief given the magnitude of the allegations against him. Okay, sometimes there isn't too much to say, but to be honest,
3265800	3267800	Mini-Lad doesn't really say much at all.
3267800	3275160	Mini-Lad- Now that some time has passed, and I've had time to reflect on everything, and get a grand scope of everything that's been going on, I wanted to set the record straight.
3275160	3282200	After this all came out, I did make a statement on this over on my Twitter, but now I think it's the correct time to sit down and make a video addressing it.
3282200	3292120	He's quite sly in how he responds to the allegations, instead of focusing on what may be true or not, he turns his attention to what he believes is false, and chooses to quote debunk those,
3292120	3296040	many of these claims not really constituting the essence of the case against him.
3296040	3303720	Mini-Lad- The first thing that I wanted to talk about with these allegations is I've never physically met them before, nor have I physically abused anybody across the board.
3303720	3309000	I wanna make people aware of that, because those are serious allegations, and I wanted to put those rumours to bed.
3309080	3315880	There are minor admissions here and there, but in some capacities, it could be seen as quite a devious play by our miniature man here.
3315880	3323400	He's very selective in what he responds to, and although what he says may well be the truth in these specific circumstances, it's hardly the full picture.
3323400	3327720	For example, on the issue of leaked chat logs regarding some aspects of his hiatus.
3327720	3335720	Mini-Lad- Some of my old Twitch mods have been leaking and screenshotting messages that I put in the mod chat, where I say that after two weeks that I gave up on therapy.
3335800	3345800	I wanted to say that this is untrue. After two weeks, I did stop going to a certain therapist, because if you've been to therapy before, you'll know that some therapists just don't fit your needs.
3345800	3351240	So after two weeks, I changed to a different therapist, and that's someone who I've been going to see every single week since.
3351240	3360040	Now, once again, this may be the case, I do not know, however, this doesn't address the messages where Mini-Lad appears to dismiss the influence of the accusations against him,
3360040	3364200	and judges the severity of them on the basis of the impact they'd have on his career.
3364200	3373560	The hilarious thing is that this video would only be approximately two and a half minutes long if he hadn't added an extra section where he tackles another claim on Twitter, which he asserts to be false.
3373560	3379080	Mini- This person is accusing me of a few things, so I would like to go through each point individually and debunk them respectively.
3379080	3386120	The first one is a photo that has come out with me and the two other YouTubers that are there, where a picture of us holding her in the air has come out.
3386120	3393960	This is a photo taken during a meet and greet at the very end of the summer camp. This is a situation where people are able to come in, they're able to get a photo,
3393960	3399400	they're able to get one or two things signed, and then they move on. During this, she said that I asked to pick her up.
3399400	3405560	For the photo, she asked if myself and the other YouTubers could hold her up for the photo, so what she's saying here is untrue.
3405560	3415400	The second point she brings up is that I sat too close to her and her friends. This part's quite confusing because everyone sat next to everyone else as a part of regular scheduled programming.
3415400	3426600	At no point was any of us unmonitored as myself, the other YouTubers that were there, also the fans that were there, but there were also adults there and counselors there monitoring everything.
3426600	3430360	So at no point during this entire summer camp was anybody unsupervised.
3430360	3438120	The third point they bring up is they claim that I call them cute and pretty. This is completely fabricated and I did not say this. This is untrue.
3438120	3446200	Like I said in the previous point, at all times during this camp, we were surrounded by camp workers and counselors to ensure the safety of myself,
3446200	3454360	and ensure the safety of them, and ensure the safety of everyone else. At all times, they could hear everything that I was saying, so this could not have happened.
3454360	3461080	I cannot possibly comment on the verity of Minnie Ladd's retort here, because he has been shown at multiple times to have lied at his convenience,
3461080	3466360	so denying an allegation which doesn't have any physical proof would practically be second nature to the man.
3466440	3472520	However, the incident does give him one last chance to address his malfeasance with Halle, Ash, and many others as well.
3472520	3480920	The situation with the other two people that I said on Twitter was a situation where my behavior was unacceptable, and I understand that, and I will continue to strive to do better.
3480920	3486760	A very mature reflection, Minnie, you've really outdone yourself there, cracking introspection.
3486760	3492360	In spite of this, some people defending him on this point may say, well, Minnie Ladd did address this in his Twitter statement,
3492360	3498520	he does reference that as a whole here, we can't expect him to just continuously bring up what he's already admitted to.
3498520	3511000	Maybe this statement is meant to be on the new claims. I could formulate many responses to such perspective, however, probably the most irrefutable one would point towards the fact that he has ignored all new claims that are harder to respond to,
3511000	3517320	such as the dismissive DMs, or the screenshots where he basically places the lives of his fans on those he has maltreated.
3517320	3522520	This is extremely selective, and it doesn't clear the air whatsoever, he's just added smoke and mirrors.
3523400	3531400	I outlined it in my original tweet back in June at the bottom, saying that I will be working on myself, and I will be attending therapy from now on into the future,
3531400	3541240	and a lot of people deem that to be untrue, but I want to be here on record saying that since then, I have been going to therapy every single week, and I will continue to go to therapy every single week.
3541240	3549560	The video also doesn't contain any evidence either, it's just him smiling and asking you to trust him, which people don't.
3549560	3559880	That should have been at least part of the reason that you made the video in the first place, you need to restore people's faith in you, and you can't do that if you provide people with no substantiation to your attestations.
3559880	3565800	He opens the video talking about transparency and setting the record straight, but he fails to do so on every count.
3565800	3574040	This video underlines the main point that he failed to dispel, the pattern of manipulative behaviour that has been the driving force behind a lot of his worst offences,
3574040	3581480	as a matter of fact, it's pretty decisive evidence that his crooked propensities are alive and kicking, and people were fast to identify that.
3581480	3594680	It's pretty obvious this video is just here to save his career, I guess, and in order to do that, he has to not focus on the real problem, and address things that aren't even real, or just other allegations that just came out.
3594680	3601240	Many creators and individuals involved were fast to call Craig out on his manoeuvres, and inability to show growth in the situation.
3601240	3612360	It was a sign that he was prone to repeating this all over again, this was exasperating, and so many people were incensed that he could even use a video like this to once more try and find a way to evade confrontation.
3612360	3622120	Speaking of evasions, many were beginning to suspect he had other motives for moving back to Northern Ireland as well, allegedly he is in Texas now, but it's hard to trust anyone's word at this point.
3622120	3632520	For me, I've always wanted to use my platform for good, I've always wanted to portray a positive message here, and I know there's nothing I can say right now that will change your guys' minds, and that's okay.
3632520	3642760	But I hope, looking forward to the future, that whether it's in the coming weeks, or the coming months, or the coming years, that what I say right now, you can take as the truth.
3642760	3650200	Regardless, a lesson was being taught. These situations would only escalate with every poorly made response you put out,
3650280	3657800	with more and more attention being brought towards its actions, it was clear that Craig was too ignorant or too fragile to actually properly confront what he'd done,
3657800	3663880	and people weren't just gonna let him off the hook via rhetorical inertia. So what could Mini-Lad do under these circumstances?
3663880	3666360	Well, this is where it becomes quite bizarre.
3666360	3679560	In certain situations, there are no preferable options, and as a person who had been caught in a series of half-truths and outright lies,
3679560	3684360	there was no panacea for Mini-Lad's woes, every option had a variety of drawbacks.
3684360	3692280	Nonetheless, after the deluge of ubiquitous condemnation following his clearing the air video, the smart option would be to leave for a much longer spell,
3692280	3700760	and actually use that time to work on himself, or at least pretend to. He has a large subscriber base, and although he had his monetisation's complications here and there,
3700760	3707320	he's almost certainly made more than enough to live off. I hope his family would be happy to support him alleviating these glaring infirmities,
3707320	3712520	and if he was actually receiving therapy, then he could take the time out until those results began to show.
3712520	3719080	Nevertheless, he demonstrably had a deep connection to his YouTube channel, and wanted to upload again. He wanted this behind him,
3719080	3725960	which wouldn't be possible if he committed to another break, so another option would be to try his luck at addressing the allegations again,
3725960	3734440	this time in a more comprehensive manner. It was unlikely to win too many over, but it may curve some of the malaise that had persisted throughout the situation.
3734440	3740040	However, this would only work if he could make a somewhat coherent case for himself, and with the abundance of evidence against him,
3740040	3746840	many were doubtful of his prospects at effectively justifying or even explaining the mentality behind much of his exploits.
3746840	3753080	So out of these two, the first option did still seem more probable, but little did we know there was an option C,
3753080	3759400	which although not impractical, did seem rather foolish, even to someone of Minilad's present notoriety.
3759400	3766680	That option would be to resume an upload schedule like nothing had happened at all, yet this was the option that Mini exercised.
3766680	3771160	It's been ten months since the last video, I miss gaming, so that being said, shall we?
3771240	3777560	Yes, only eight days after his clone the Air Blunder, he uploads a video called Internet's craziest gaming glitches.
3777560	3786280	I'm not sure if the missed apostrophe is an oversight or a cry for help, but to summarise, in his video, he reacts to the popular subreddit r slash game physics,
3786280	3794040	imparting priceless insight with his reactions to the titular forum. This video appears to have been recorded while he was still in his previous accommodation,
3794040	3799800	and thus seems to be a planned release, but regardless of when it was made, the Minilad flare was shining through.
3801400	3802120	Okay.
3808360	3809160	Go on.
3810520	3815400	Big brain! Huge brain! That is 4000 IQ!
3815400	3819480	They bring care packages out on drones? Bro, future crazy!
3819480	3825320	I'm so glad that Mini has continued uploading, aren't you? What would we ever do with content like this?
3825320	3829880	Though I do sometimes wonder if he was inserting subliminal messages within his text.
3829960	3833560	In a nutshell, everyone I was growing up, whenever I was in school, I was always so afraid like,
3833560	3837080	adulthood seems so scary, like even like the year above you, you're like,
3837800	3844440	the older ones, God has forsaken you, I am but a mere squire compared to the year above,
3844440	3848680	and then you think of people when they're like 21, you're like, oh, they have their life together,
3848680	3853720	they're gonna have their own 401k pensions, they're gonna have a wife and kids,
3853720	3857880	and then you get there and you realise that the world has no idea what's going on
3857880	3863480	95% of the time. As a guy who's 25 years old right now, not a clue. Just remember that,
3863480	3866920	going forth in life, you're gonna take away anything from this video, take away this.
3866920	3868200	No one has a clue.
3868200	3872520	Now, as MiniLad videos go, this was nothing particularly different from the routine content
3872520	3876200	that many would have expected from his channel, but there was definitely an element of it which
3876200	3881000	seems strained given the state of affairs. Either Mini didn't actually care for the charges levied
3881000	3885080	against him, or he's contriving a persona to try and cover up the fact that it bothers him.
3885080	3890200	Both of these rationalisations imply that the happy-go-lucky attitude is a pretext for a very
3890200	3895320	cynical ploy to ride out the stigma he was facing. This philosophy was exhibited in the leaked DMs,
3895320	3899560	people forget, and move on. That's what he's hoping. When the critics forget,
3899560	3903720	you'll be left with your dedicated audience who are much more interested in your output,
3903720	3907640	rather than the actual moral conundrum of viewing someone of that character.
3907640	3912680	And who would want to miss out on the premium laughs like those supplied by MiniLad?
3913560	3931560	With that said, his plan didn't quite work out as intended. His reddit reaction video broke even
3931560	3936200	between likes and dislikes, and future uploads didn't fare much better. His next offering was
3936200	3940840	a let's play of Flight Simulator, which, although producing no exceptional in-game moments,
3940840	3944920	did stimulate some pretty hilarious comments, the sort that MiniLad would react to,
3944920	3951080	though he hasn't yet. Good idea, Craig, write that one down. That aside, his ratio was much worse on
3951080	3955720	this video, with the likes more than halving, and the dislikes actually increasing on the previous
3955720	3960120	upload. His next video didn't show signs of improvement either, although he did secure
3960120	3965320	a sponsorship for it. It was your job to bring the speaker. You go to your car and you realise
3965320	3969960	the speaker is dead. What are you going to do? Your friends are never going to trust you again.
3969960	3974360	You're never going to get invited out anywhere again. Your life is going to come spiralling down.
3975480	3980360	Jimmy, with the brand new Cove Commuter 2, you'll never have to worry about that again.
3980360	3985400	With its amazing seven hour battery life, a subwoofer on both hands to play bangers
3985400	3994520	with volume like this. What more do you need? However, once people made his partner's
3994520	3999080	Cove aware of MiniLad's capers, the video was removed on the company's request.
3999080	4004040	I almost want to give points for the sheer goal of finding a sponsor to work with, in spite of
4004040	4009000	knowing the inevitable backlash the business would face, but I won't because it's MiniLad, and MiniLad
4009000	4014760	deserves nil poi. It seems that with every attempt that Mini made to elude the critical masses,
4014760	4019400	it merely invigorated them more, predominantly because people saw it for what it was, and they
4019400	4025080	weren't going to forget it just because MiniLad wanted them to. This, ladies and gentlemen,
4025640	4030520	is a mistake. Every video since followed a similar trend, with users flooding his comments,
4030520	4034600	his ratings, and every conceivable route that may allow Mini back into the mainstream.
4034600	4038760	YouTube also took it upon themselves to punish him as well, revoking his AdSense partnership,
4038760	4042600	thus preventing him from generating revenue via commercials. The videos themselves are
4042600	4046360	pretty mediocre, the thumbnails make me feel like I'm living in some dystopian nightmare,
4046360	4049960	the shark in this one looks about as fed up as Craig shit as most people are. In his newest
4049960	4054120	video at the time of writing, which will be a long time ago at this point, the hot chip one,
4054120	4058840	the video literally opens with Comic Sans, and once again, not sure if to read that as a cry
4058840	4063960	for help, but MiniLad was the only one who could make that move. I wasn't sure how many videos it
4063960	4068040	was going to take for Mini to realise that the internet denizens weren't letting this one go,
4068040	4071960	and that he's actually suffered far more by putting on this scene, but it was rather awkward
4071960	4076280	and embarrassing for anyone who's aware of the situation, especially former fans, to watch this
4076280	4081720	man who was once respected reduced to an outcast who literally eat hot chip and lie. With every
4081720	4086040	upload, he besmirched his reputation further, and obscured his road to redemption. At first,
4086040	4090280	it seemed to be a calculated move to temper the odium towards him, but at a certain point,
4090280	4094200	it just seemed to be a desperate default to familiarity, because he couldn't think of
4094200	4101320	anything else. Everything that we once knew is now gone. It's tragic for all involved, many of whom
4101320	4105880	just want closure above all, but have to watch this man dance on the grave of his legacy because
4105880	4110840	he's too proud to actually face down his actions. But unfortunately, we can't be overly surprised at
4110840	4114280	this. It's been something present for longer than many have probably considered.
4133720	4138120	However, eventually, after numerous further failed attempts to shirk the situation at hand,
4138120	4148760	he had a sudden change of heart, and we finally had something to seriously discuss.
4153400	4157000	The original plan was to release this video at the end of December, as a way to depict
4157000	4161320	Mini Ladd's continuous failure to move past this controversy. However, before I could release it,
4161320	4165640	our friend Craig decided to defy expectations, dropping a video where he appears to tackle
4165640	4189400	the allegations head on. In this video, he addresses some of the messages in question,
4189400	4194360	explains his motives, and apologises profusely. Initially, this was well received by his intimate
4194360	4198680	fanbase, but once again, as other commentators caught wind of it, momentum turned once more
4198680	4217640	against him, for a variety of reasons that I'll briefly talk about now. Some of these people
4217640	4222280	responded to him by once more chastising his actions, which isn't wrong, but he's not
4222280	4226520	necessarily defending them in this circumstance, so saying he shouldn't have done it is somewhat
4226520	4231160	redundant because he's not disputing it. Others went in on the evidence that he admitted, such as
4231160	4235640	various comments we've discussed prior that really do not flatter his character in any way, and I
4235640	4239640	generally agree with this stance, given how the comments could definitely be indicative of his
4239640	4243800	own personal attitudes. If he wanted to be fully transparent, he should have included them.
4243800	4247720	However, it's also important to note those comments are primarily self-incriminating in
4247720	4251800	the fact that they are an inadequate way to address his misdeeds, and this video may serve
4251880	4256760	as a fresh attempt to try and reflect on his initial actions, like saving a new word document
4256760	4261080	over a previous one. I don't necessarily agree with it, but given how others have already pointed
4261080	4265560	it out, I figured I'd approach this upload from a different angle. Now, I'm aware that Minilad has
4265560	4269720	not been particularly honest in confronting his actions, and for many, there isn't much of an
4269720	4274440	incentive to believe the explanations he provides here. However, for the sake of discourse, I am
4274440	4278280	going to entertain that position and see what can be said for it, and if there are any points of
4278280	4282600	value that can be drawn from his long overdue apology, I am going to listen to Minilad, I am
4282600	4286760	even going to try and believe him, and attempt to impart some words of wisdom at least.
4308280	4320840	One of the first points that Craig goes in on is this one, the relationship between
4320840	4325240	himself and his accusers. This serves as some context to the discourse surrounding his intent,
4325240	4329400	his point being that he possessed a closer prior relationship with the other individuals involved
4329400	4333720	than many may have assumed in the past. In the context of his actions, if this was true, it would
4333720	4338840	serve to marginally reduce that power deficit between him and those his actions affected,
4338840	4342200	in comparison to that between him and a random fan for example.
4354680	4358680	It also serves as an indirect assertion for why he may have wrongfully assumed that the people
4358680	4362280	he shared these antics with were mentally prepared to interact with him on that level,
4362280	4364520	and appealed to his ignorance rather than malice.
4381480	4384440	The problem is that although this may be applicable with Hallie, he doesn't really
4384440	4389320	provide it with Ash, which points to one of the most pressing issues regarding this whole shambles.
4389320	4393080	However, Mini still has his explanations for his actions to convey.
4419880	4424040	Now, a lot of people gave him criticism for this comment, claiming that he was trying to use suicide
4424040	4428360	as a scapegoat, but that's a very shaky argument for me on its own. At the end of the day, we all
4428360	4432600	have mindsets that can affect our actions, and if that was the one that affected Mini Ladd's actions,
4432600	4437160	then so be it. Although what he did was extremely wrong, and his position assumes accountability,
4437160	4441320	being an adult does not make you an infallible being. There's no holy grail of wisdom that you
4441320	4445560	sit from, people do bad things, it doesn't mean they're eternally damned to be bad people.
4445560	4449560	However, the reasoning behind those actions is invaluable in my opinion, and this is where Mini
4449560	4453720	Ladd's perspective begins to buckle for certain audience members. There are many reasons that I
4453720	4458440	can understand why someone may behave out of order, desperation, deprivation, but I have to
4458440	4462840	admit that I find suicide to be a curious rationalisation, especially in the context
4462840	4467240	that Mini presents. He doesn't just present the thought as one's impending death as an explanation
4467240	4471480	for his actions, but as a motivation for his actions, this idea that if he was going to go out,
4471480	4476280	then he might as well go out with his greatest vice. But if your own mortality is the only thing
4476280	4480440	keeping you from behaving in such a way, then it just pays more testimony to this idea that
4480440	4484760	you're a self-interested charlatan. Your moral compass shouldn't be based on the consequences
4484760	4489000	that you personally have to face down for your actions, especially given their severity,
4489000	4493000	however at the same time, he does also acknowledge this not too long after.
4493000	4498200	Mini Ladd- The reality is I was being selfish, I wasn't thinking about repercussions, I wasn't
4498200	4503640	thinking about anything, I was just being stupid, and I really want to apologise for that. I just
4503640	4511160	wasn't thinking, and I regret it, I've regretted it since, and for that, for both Halle and Ash,
4511160	4512120	I'm really sorry.
4512120	4515800	As a matter of fact, he pretty much admits to having a completely crooked objective in the
4515800	4520120	interruptions, which may make some wonder why he tried to humanise it in the first place. The way
4520120	4525000	I see it is once again to mediate his actions, to try and distance himself from narratives that may
4525000	4530200	paint him in a more Austin Jones style predator light, which I don't think he is, although there
4530200	4534760	are some parallels. He wants to make his actions somewhat tangible to his viewers while being
4534760	4539400	suitably self-critical, it's the best balance for a video like this, but it doesn't feel completely
4539400	4543800	compatible, thus meaning it doesn't land for a majority of his detractors, and even those who
4543800	4546120	may be sympathetic towards him. Why?
4546120	4550760	Mini Ladd- Whenever I saw them coming out with my message I sent them, I sent them this,
4550760	4558360	this isn't me, that's not right, it's something that I completely regret. I panicked, I was
4558360	4564440	scared, I didn't know what to do, and I just, I love my job so much that I didn't want it to go
4564440	4575160	away, and I just wasn't right. So to Halle and to Ash here at the end up, and even to Laura for
4575240	4582680	bringing that up, I'm sorry guys, you were, you were my friends, I failed you, I was only thinking
4582680	4585960	of myself and I was being stupid, and I wish I could take it all back.
4585960	4589560	Well there's obviously the case of too little too late, but I think the greater point that it
4589560	4594360	represents is this personal change. As said, I don't think being an adult makes you invulnerable
4594360	4598360	to misconduct, and although it is exceptionally irresponsible given his level of influence,
4598360	4602040	and he is right to be called out for it, your relative size does not make you a fountain of
4602040	4606200	wisdom. I've always advocated a live and learn philosophy, if someone has demonstrated a change
4606200	4610440	in their behaviour, evolved and grown as a person, then I will be the first to back them. The issue
4610440	4614680	is that as a large creator, he already had a relatively small domain to prove growth that
4614680	4619000	may come with evolving life circumstances, but on top of that, he just failed to do so.
4619000	4623640	His failure was what provoked this in the first place, in fact he only cared when his income began
4623640	4628040	to suffer, and because he attempted to ignore it completely until that point, there's no trust in
4628040	4632760	his word, whether it was coincidence or not. I could believe that he was afraid and scared for
4632760	4637560	his career and everything he might lose, that's an understandable fear, but the fact of the matter is
4637560	4642520	that he lost more by continuing to take advantage of people's charity and showing that he had not
4642520	4653080	changed, whether he was scared or not. This is also why he couldn't afford to ignore his previous
4653080	4657240	failures to address it properly, and other rather dismissive comments. Now he does have an
4657240	4680680	explanation for his subpar responses, which he kinda slips in. This idea of the PR team,
4680680	4685080	now I've heard of these PR team's out of touch lawyers and the rest, and they can really provide
4685080	4689160	genuinely garbage guidance because they probably learn from the playbook of OJ Simpson,
4689160	4693800	which is a whole different arena. However, once again, it's hard to say if this is just a scapegoat,
4693800	4698200	and even if it isn't, you gotta have some strength of character to not rely on other people to get
4698200	4702840	you out of a mess you put yourself in. You didn't need a PR team to solicit explicit content,
4702840	4706760	so what is the difference here? I feel for many this illustrated the crux of the matter,
4706760	4711720	how much of it rode on how people interpreted Mini Ladd's own character in the sincerity of
4711720	4716360	his actions. He admits that he behaved terribly and manipulated many people whom he shouldn't
4716360	4720280	have. He's worked on himself, but I think his failure to address it has made his actions look
4720280	4725400	even more incriminating. People do shitty things, make bad decisions, enter toxic dynamics. The
4725400	4729080	thing is, many people do it because they either don't know better or their judgement has been
4729080	4733480	impaired by other factors to the point where they have a reduced capacity to understand the possible
4733480	4737960	ramifications that their behaviour may entail. However, there are key nuances here that do make
4737960	4742520	Mini Ladd's behaviour exceptional, and whether people can articulate it or not, they know it's
4742520	4747800	there. As a launch creator, he targeted and became involved with people who had a specific servitude
4747800	4753400	to him prior. Now, as expressed, he did have pre-existing friendships with these people in a
4753400	4758200	way, and I can understand why he wanted to clarify that, because that can yield attachments sometimes
4758200	4762760	that lose context of significant details, particularly online. It does challenge this idea
4762760	4767080	that he was pursuing people for the sole reason that they were underage. However, this explanation
4767080	4771640	is only really remotely sympathetic if it was based on genuine feelings he possessed, which as
4771640	4776360	much of the evidence and his own elaboration shows really wasn't. He didn't have feelings for these
4776360	4780840	people, he could have had anyone's attention for such images, which makes his actions seem even
4780840	4785720	more dirty and opportunistic. When it comes to his behaviour towards his victims, he basically
4785720	4790600	coerced what he needed out of them and dipped, that's conscious sexual exploitation. Their
4790600	4794280	judgement was already impacted by their own affection towards him, and his judgement,
4794280	4799080	although possibly limited by his then present mentality, was merely influenced to disregard
4799080	4803240	the wellbeing of those he affected. He often did speak down to them, and reading the DMs,
4803240	4807880	even without the rest of the context, it is somewhat discomforting. The fact that he behaved
4807880	4813160	in this way specifically undermines any possible context that friendship could provide. His video
4813160	4817880	also skirts around his most serious misdeeds, and frames it as mostly flirting, and although
4817880	4822840	his interactions may have primarily occupied that category, the more severe individual incidents
4822840	4828520	supersede any of the more minor ones. Frequency of occurrence in this case is a secondary factor.
4838520	4843720	Minilab was purposeful with intent, and that's the most damning feature. He manipulated people
4843720	4848120	for his own gratification, there was nothing sincere about his actions, so when he puts his
4848120	4852920	failures in responding down to a dysfunctional PR team, it's not trustworthy, because this PR
4852920	4857400	team appears to have advised him to maintain the same pattern of behaviour that landed himself
4857400	4861400	in this mess in the first place, a pattern of behaviour he should have corrected a long time
4861400	4866440	ago. He credits himself for defying his PR team by messaging apologies to those his actions
4866440	4870680	affected, but he can't say those messages were written with sincere intent when they were sent
4870680	4875480	months after he was first called out in August, and done while he continued to refuse to address
4875480	4880760	the apt requests of those he affected. Minilab's actions were exacerbated by his character,
4880760	4884920	an arrogant yet fragile ego which fed on the validation of people who were too blinded by
4884920	4889480	their own perception of him. If Craig had been similarly deluded and cleaned up his act, then
4889480	4894680	there may be a case for him, but as it is, it seemed indicative of his character. He may genuinely
4894680	4899960	be regretful now, but it also may be a case of not realising what he had until it was gone.
4899960	4904360	At the same time, it could just be another case of his manipulation, so let's talk about that.
4905480	4912120	The
4916280	4920280	YouTube is my life. I've been doing it full time for seven, eight years now. You know,
4920280	4926120	the Minilab channel is ten years old next year and it's all I know. It's what I love. It's my
4926120	4933240	passion. It's what I wake up every day and I love to do. And I realise over the last even few years
4933240	4939480	that I just haven't put the love and attention into it. And you know what I want. I want,
4939480	4944600	I want it to be like a portfolio of the cool things that I've done and I want to rekindle
4944600	4951080	myself. I want to find out who I am. Not Minilab, not anything like that. I want to find Craig.
4951080	4955480	In spite of your criticisms, when you finish watching his apology video, it's easy to feel
4955480	4961000	a bit more closure with regards to the situation, and many did. Even those involved, such as Halley,
4961000	4965960	asked those hawky Minilab to move on. After all, he has done what was asked of him by those his
4965960	4970440	actions affected. In some ways, the video may make you feel more inclined to trust that this time
4970440	4975400	he's genuine in his desire to change. From that perspective, it would be fair to leave it behind.
4975400	4979400	However, it could easily just be another calculated move, one that he's pulled before,
4979400	4983960	and I think it's fair to keep an eye on that for if he ever decides to return one day.
4983960	4990680	If there's one, if there's one thing from this that I want to be a flip is this. I am so fed up
4990680	4997880	and tired. Honestly, I'm so fed up and tired of seeing all these drama channels, uh, doing stories
4998680	5003800	and giving the wrong information in the story. On June the 10th, just a couple of weeks before much
5003800	5008680	of what would lead us to where we are today would transpire, Minilab had released another apology,
5008680	5013640	this one towards Terrorizer. In the statement, he expressed regret for what he said and desire
5013640	5018440	to rebuild the friendship they once had. This was met with praise from many within the community.
5018440	5023640	However, one person appeared to refrain from accepting this offering of peace, Terrorizer
5023640	5028360	himself. Following the rather heated exchange at the end of August, Brian had mostly rebuffed any
5028360	5032840	attempt at settlement between the two parties, in spite of many's pleas and claims that the hatchet
5032840	5036920	had been buried. At points, he'd even been characterised as stubborn or unreasonable due
5036920	5041400	to his unwillingness to reconcile with his former companion. However, I think he was completely
5041400	5045880	within his rights to decline any step towards reproachment, because this didn't seem to be a
5045880	5050120	case of differing perspectives, this was a situation where someone publicly and knowingly
5050120	5055480	attacked a person on a very sensitive subject in a way that could have harmed multiple relationships.
5055480	5059640	We all snap sometimes and say things that we probably shouldn't, however, our friends will
5059640	5063960	appreciate that they probably came from a place of emotion. Emotionally driven perspectives may
5063960	5067880	be irrational but will reflect what someone perceives in the moment. It was very hard to see
5067880	5072280	how Minilab could have interpreted the situation in the way he presented it, and therefore with
5072280	5076360	Brian's context, he couldn't read it as anything other than pernicious point scoring. It was
5076360	5081240	emotional manipulation because Minilab presented his case in calm, reasoned good faith, while
5081240	5085160	making multiple claims that were dubious at best and malicious at worst.
5085160	5087160	Just thinking about that whole thing pisses me off.
5088840	5093640	Alright, can we move on? Let's move on. Alright, let's not talk about stupid drama.
5094280	5098440	Terroriser was just another victim of this, but people didn't see it that way until the
5098440	5101000	extent of Mini's manipulation became clear.
5102040	5108040	I felt so fucking terrified. I was just trying to be a good friend. I was just trying to be a
5108040	5112760	good friend, and I thought that's what he thought I was, but all I was was a goddamn tool.
5114120	5119960	A goddamn tool to keep, to keep anybody from knowing who he truly was.
5119960	5124840	The allegations that preceded nearly a fortnight after his apology to Brian didn't just serve in
5124840	5129720	exposing Minilab's indecency, but also as further evidence for the degree of puppetry he was
5129720	5135080	employing to solicit what he desired, even if that material in question was illegal. He would argue
5135080	5140280	over the age of consent and so on, the differences in certain states and countries. Setting aside
5140280	5145240	the point that the age of consent doesn't parallel the laws regarding exchange of explicit images in
5145240	5150440	many places, it's not just that detail at play here, it's the fact that he actively pursued
5150440	5155800	younger fans who looked up to him and used his influence to acquire content that they otherwise
5155800	5160520	would not have consented to giving. A lot of people focus on the sexual nature of what he did,
5160520	5164280	which is definitely a factor, but I think his actions are also implicative, not in that he's
5164280	5169240	some serial pedo, but more that he exploited people to solicit something he desired, which is
5169240	5174680	aggravated by the nature of the content. Even the Twitlonga emphasises manipulation. Hell, what
5174680	5179240	further provoked people to come forward was the result of a consensual relationship with another
5179240	5184760	adult. The concern wasn't just that Minilab had a bad habit or a bad addiction, one that he may well
5184760	5190760	have left behind, but that he was a fundamentally broken person who refused to fix himself. He knew
5190760	5195640	he was doing that, and he knew exactly how to present himself in a way that would appeal to
5195640	5200760	various emotional fraities. When confronted, he once more appealed to their pity and sympathy,
5200760	5205800	pledging to seek help and support, and reinforcing the fact that he was a changed man. The saddest
5205800	5209960	thing is that people like Halle held off on going public because they genuinely believed this,
5209960	5214680	they knew the internet would be hostile, and they wanted to give Minilab a chance to have a career
5214680	5219240	in spite of his actions, but he manipulated them on this as well, and when it became apparent to
5219240	5223720	them that he had behaved no differently in his previous relationships, they knew there was no
5223720	5228600	other option. The internet was hostile, but when Minilab put out his response, admitting to his
5228600	5233800	malefaction, and promising the rectification that would be incumbent on him, many actually did
5233800	5238680	respond somewhat optimistically, stating that although his actions were terrible, they hoped he'd
5238680	5243880	receive the help he needed. However, this post would prove to be only the start of the greatest,
5243880	5249800	yet most transparent manipulation as of now, the largest proverbial middle finger to all those his
5249800	5250840	actions affected.
5250840	5255240	Minilab- If I leave the house, that means I'm not able to work on my videos, and I'm not able to work on this
5255240	5262680	thing and that thing, and it became such a mind game that I lost myself. And that's, it's hard to
5262680	5270680	admit, but it's the reality of it. I lost myself, but I'm happy to say that I'm regathering it, I'm
5270680	5272120	finding my roots again.
5272120	5276760	A pair of recorded statements that would attempt to deceive his fans into thinking that his hiatus
5276760	5281400	was actually inspired by the need to find himself, and that many of the allegations were misguided or
5281400	5286600	ill-founded, in spite of the fact that many of that which he focused on did not come close to aggregating
5286600	5292200	the crux of the matter, once more revealing his duplicitous nature, and provoking further backlash.
5293720	5303880	Minilab- It's terrible. And the fact that we got five minutes of no genuine, like, feelings through that whole
5303880	5311960	thing, as a person who knew him, or thought I did, uh, yeah, that didn't seem very goddamn genuine.
5312600	5318760	This led to what can only be regarded as a content implosion of unprecedented scale, consistently being
5318760	5323960	harangued from all angles, and growing more and more pathetic with the passage of time, highlighting
5323960	5329000	this desperation. Whether it was arrogance, ignorance, or something that we don't know, he was essentially
5329000	5334600	adding a coat of paint to a train wreck. Maybe manipulation is all he knew, maybe it's all he's ever
5334600	5339640	known. Watching him game and laugh like nothing was going on was arguably more annoying than anything
5339640	5343880	else for those he's wronged, and it brought into question all the times he's claimed to care, and the
5343880	5348520	times he's used those narratives to provide him with greater moral gravitas. Some people point
5348520	5352680	towards his charity work as if it defends his character, but with the current circumstances
5352680	5357320	considered, I think it only entrenches the fraud, it made every good action seem contrived for
5357320	5362360	self-serving purposes, it made Mini Ladd's existence seem manipulative. If Mini Ladd really
5362360	5366840	cared so much about the fans whose lives were on the line in those DMs, he would have gone out of
5366840	5370360	his way to prove he was a good person, and to rebuild that lost faith.
5375640	5381880	Let him know. Y'all thought you were done with me, huh? Yeah, enjoy that award, you prick. It's the last
5381880	5386840	one you're gonna get. I'm sorry. I've dealt with a lot of miscreants on this channel, and many of them
5386840	5391480	have done terrible things, but a lot of the time I don't find myself hating them for what they've
5391480	5396200	done, but more how they respond when finally having to confront their actions. The hubris,
5396200	5401800	the insolence, the absurdity. Mini Ladd is the epitome of moral desertion under fire.
5401800	5405640	If people showed that they had improved, or that they were working on themselves, although it may
5405640	5410120	be hard to look at them in the same way you did before, you can at least feel hope that they might
5410120	5414920	find themselves, or support them on that journey, and return to being a positive force in people's
5414920	5419160	lives at some point in the future. There's no hope here, only whatever you call this.
5429160	5434280	Mini Ladd says he's been seeing a therapist, and I'm genuinely glad. However, I hope his hiatus this
5434280	5439160	time will be more serious than any previous ones undertaken, and I hope his therapist and those
5439160	5443800	around him emphasise this, because it seems to me that he's still got a bit of a way to go on this
5443800	5449240	journey, and these videos are hardly instrumental to that. I say this with the proviso that his
5449240	5454120	therapist is real, and it's not just another story, but looking at his past, this can sometimes feel
5454120	5456120	like wishful thinking, and that's a shame.
5456120	5473080	...
5473080	5477800	Walking around casually, then you got these guys, you are my penis!
5477800	5482360	Being caught up in the past is like being caught in quicksand, the more struggling you do, the more it
5482360	5488520	seems to consume you, but you can't just escape it at your own convenience, you need someone to help you out.
5488520	5502920	...
5502920	5508440	Mini Ladd spent many years ascending the YouTube hierarchy, and amassing a loyal fan base. However,
5508440	5514280	his position below Banos always motivated him to aspire for a greater role as an independent creator.
5514280	5519560	In many ways, he wanted to disconnect from that association, he wanted to leave the past behind,
5519560	5525320	however, it wasn't just that, he wanted to enshrine his status as an individual, and in my opinion,
5525320	5530600	outshine his erstwhile colleagues. Now, in many regards, these two objectives aren't in opposition
5530600	5535720	to each other, many would argue that actually crafting your own identity is part of moving forward
5535720	5541000	as a creator. However, I think looking at his old comments, there was an insecurity, a desire to be
5541000	5547240	something greater for the sake of it, a necessity to prove himself at any expense. With many of his
5547240	5551640	accomplishments, Mini appeared to be heading in the direction of writing himself into the YouTube
5551640	5556440	history books as an unequivocal force for good, his work for charity receiving widespread
5556440	5562520	recognition and acclaim. However, whether due to circumstances or complacency, the mask began to slip.
5563160	5567320	All they did was play Fortnite and Gmod and then talk shit about other YouTubers.
5567320	5572600	In this reflection of his past, he showed that whether he had changed in status, his character hadn't really
5572600	5577560	followed. What many may perceive as trash talk may just have been another underhanded attempt to sway
5577560	5583000	audiences away from those he used to be close to. In a drama with Terrorizer that his comments subsequently
5583000	5587640	precipitated, he showed that he had a much greater interest in his image, rather than the truth,
5587640	5592200	using people's limited perspective on past circumstances to twist the version of events and
5592200	5596920	capitalize on people's sympathies. After being caught out in his ploy, he changed his tone,
5596920	5601720	switching to one about moving forward, in spite of his failure to sufficiently convince his old friend
5601720	5606760	that was really what he cared about. This is because, to move forward, you have to believe that the person
5606760	5611560	has changed from their past self, and the simple truth was that Mini-Lad hadn't, and in the following
5611560	5613160	year, this was proven time.
5613160	5615080	Mini-Lad- I went on this mental health journey.
5615080	5615800	And time.
5615800	5620280	Mini- She would be the person who's responsible for killing thousands of people.
5620280	5621080	And time.
5621080	5622440	Mini- I wanted to set the record straight.
5622440	5627480	Again. In his videos after the allegations, Mini tried to implant this narrative into the viewer's minds
5627480	5632840	about journeys, and personal progress, while simultaneously failing to acknowledge what he was meant to be
5632840	5638040	progressing from, using the general distaste of concepts like cancel culture in attempting to override the
5638040	5640840	shock value that detailing his actions may provoke.
5640840	5645400	At the start, I said that we all want to move on from our past, and we don't want it held over us.
5645400	5650040	That remains true, and I'll always defend someone who I legitimately believe has changed their ways,
5650040	5653800	but I also said if we don't acknowledge it, then we are prone to repeating it.
5653800	5658840	In many ways, Mini showed that the past was still present, and that he hadn't grown nor learned from his
5658840	5663240	previous abasement, utilizing the narratives, but failing to respect their meaning.
5663240	5666600	The allegations weren't just their own indictment of Mini-Lad's behaviour,
5666600	5670040	they were a test of his character, and he flunked them miserably.
5670040	5674360	This was a situation where he had used his power as a YouTuber in multiple ways.
5674360	5679400	It was crucial to his status as a public figure that he cleared the air, yet he failed to do so.
5679400	5681480	In fact, he only polluted it more.
5681480	5684600	This is why people didn't move on, this is why people were vocal.
5684600	5688680	There were so many willing to give Mini a second chance, including those close to him,
5688680	5692760	but he just tried to distance himself from the consequences while projecting the exact same
5692760	5695800	behaviour that screwed over so many people previously.
5695800	5699640	It seemed he was hoping he'd tire out all those who were trying to maintain the heat,
5699640	5703240	and possibly even provoke sympathy from those who may not have felt favourably
5703240	5706520	towards the continuing backlash, but it was all to no avail.
5706520	5710040	Eventually, he did address the allegations against him more directly,
5710040	5713960	but it was hard to trust his word because it felt like his hand was forced.
5713960	5718600	If no one had ever applied that pressure, would he have continued to ignore it?
5718920	5720840	That's a very important question.
5720840	5722600	I didn't know where I was going.
5722600	5724680	I didn't try and make anything of it.
5724680	5729800	Damn, my first, my only goal I ever had on YouTube is I wanted to hit 100 subscribers.
5729800	5731960	Now the channel's on nearly 6 million.
5731960	5733320	This one's on 1.3.
5733880	5735240	I wanted to hit 100.
5735800	5736760	That's all I wanted.
5736760	5741880	And you guys came along and you changed my life infinitely, and for that I'm forever grateful.
5742440	5746120	For every single person watching this video, that means you saw this video,
5746200	5749400	you clicked on it, and you support me in that, and I thank you for that.
5749400	5754440	If what's spoken about today makes you feel sad or disappointed as a former or present fan of his,
5754440	5755640	then that's okay.
5755640	5759880	You're not a bad person for having looked up to someone who you thought was a good person.
5759880	5763720	It's just important to not allow yourself to be trapped in that past romanticisation
5763720	5765560	of what you thought that person was.
5765560	5770120	Many has used his reputation and how people admired him to hold others hostage,
5770120	5774520	and you deserve to be more than ammunition for a narcissist's bloated ego.
5774520	5777320	At the same time, if you want to help him make that change,
5777320	5780840	like he says he wants to at this point, then I can't stop you on principle.
5780840	5785240	It's not my job as a viewer or spectator to tell you exactly what he thinks right now,
5785240	5789000	and I don't think anyone losing everything they have for the rest of their lives
5789000	5790760	is gonna help with rehabilitation,
5790760	5793400	but know that it has to be a highly cautious investment,
5793400	5798120	because his track record shows he's taken advantage of what he's been given far too often.
5798120	5801960	As for Mini, I'll leave the internet to decide what they want to do with him.
5801960	5804200	Many want him off the platform altogether.
5804280	5807800	Some want him to face charges, but to be honest, whatever the outcome,
5807800	5809960	the blame falls squarely at his feet.
5809960	5812280	It's not something he's going to be leaving behind.
5812280	5814040	Past, present, or future.
5814040	5818840	This reality reveals that Mini-Lad perhaps never cared about all those he claimed to,
5818840	5820760	and that may be the greatest letdown.
5820760	5824120	He tied himself to the point of mental health, claiming to be a friend,
5824120	5825880	doing all these wonderful things,
5825880	5829880	yet behind the scenes would use the association to merely protect the facade,
5829880	5832600	and silence those who wanted to tear it down.
5832600	5836040	The Mini-Lad saga is probably one of the most disheartening stories to cover,
5836040	5838920	because I think so many expected better,
5838920	5842840	and extended compassion towards him with the hope that he would be better.
5843480	5846600	But many only cared about what people thought,
5846600	5848440	rather than how they felt.
5848440	5852280	He recognised how many viewed him, and used it for his own gratification.
5852280	5855080	He saw those ready to speak out and engineered silence.
5855080	5856920	He exploited a sympathetic audience,
5856920	5860280	but failed to extend the same sympathy to those his actions affected.
5860280	5863080	The one thing he could never seem to do was the right thing,
5863080	5866280	and that's the single consistency I'll give him credit for.
5866280	5869160	Mini-Lad is the personification of 2020,
5869160	5872600	a continuous cycle of the open expectation of improvement,
5872600	5876440	followed by disappointment when we realise the true extent of the depravity.
5876440	5881960	It is depressing, and in times like these, it is easy for the stress to make one reminisce.
5881960	5885000	At the start, I spoke about returning to the bygone days,
5885000	5888280	a time where there were fewer worries, everything seemed simpler.
5888280	5894200	I want this space, this channel, this area to be somewhere that people can come in and feel welcome,
5894200	5898120	then they can leave with a smile on their face, and be happy.
5898120	5899400	That's all that I want.
5899400	5902680	In Mini-Lad's clearing the air video, and his subsequent apology,
5902680	5904840	he showed a yearning for that himself,
5904840	5907640	a desire to restore that ethos with his channel,
5907640	5911080	and in a way, this may have been followed through in certain uploads.
5911080	5912520	However, for audience members,
5912520	5917240	you can't do that until you've shown that you were the person that people thought you were before.
5917320	5921720	It changed the meaning of the content, they were no longer the feel-good escape for some,
5921720	5923160	they were part of the ordeal.
5923160	5927480	People weren't smiling, the facade was incontrovertible, and many had to drop the act,
5927480	5930920	and realise that this would not wash, it was no longer the same.
5931480	5936360	Times change, but it's not always the things around that change, more so our knowledge of them.
5936360	5942040	The past Mini-Lad was the present Mini-Lad, we unfortunately, or fortunately, just know more now,
5942040	5946360	and whether you still wish to go back to a time of blissful ignorance, you're at the end of the video.
5946360	5948440	So that's not an option. Apologies.
5951000	5954680	I don't expect daffodils and rainbows after this.
5955320	5956520	I want it to be raw.
5956520	5959160	I want you guys to build up trust in me over time, and
5960120	5962360	I want to be able to make videos that I'm proud of,
5962360	5965800	and I want to be able to be better, and that's what I wanted to say.
5968120	5969640	So that's the end of the video.
5969640	5972840	Woo, I'm here, I'm alive still.
5972840	5979800	I want to give a big thanks to my editors, they're probably somewhere in existence right now,
5979800	5985240	having a nice, maybe not so nice day, and send them some love if you can,
5985240	5987320	I'll leave their links in the pinned comments.
5987320	5991320	Big thanks to the Patrons, Patrons, I've got that word right now,

6031400	6035080	I don't really have too much else to add, my socials, as always, will be in the bottom
6035080	6039480	of the pinned comment, or somewhere around there, I don't know, depends what I'm doing,
6039480	6042120	but yes, I don't really have too much else to add.
6042120	6047400	I hope you guys have a good day, take care, I'm The Right Opinion, and I'll see you in the next one.
