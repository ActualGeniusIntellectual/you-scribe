0	5900	The big question, not just what happens to the parents, but also the children who benefited from the cheating scandal.
5900	10900	And well before the scandal broke, Olivia Giannulli was famous for her presence on social media.
10900	14100	Well now she's become target number one for public outrage.
19100	24100	Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time.
24100	29900	And today we are talking about the education system, and a YouTuber who cut a few corners.
29900	30700	Hooray.
30700	35800	You see my friends, I attend university, or college as the Americans love to call it.
35800	41600	Exciting I know, behind basically everything else in my life, education is my favourite activity.
41600	48600	However, I'm not here to discuss how much I definitely love my courses, because for all I know, the tutors might be watching.
48600	54600	But if you are, give me good grades, or else my next video might be on you, and I might just cross my arms.
54600	58300	As always, the subjects I cover have a YouTube twist thrown in,
58300	61700	and today is no exception, because we are going to university.
61700	64700	Hooray, get your degree, and come on in.
64700	67900	But more importantly to the University of Southern California,
67900	73900	to a situation that has garnered a lot of attention recently, and a YouTuber who has been at the centre of it.
73900	79500	Now to provide some background for you twats, the University of Southern California, abbreviated to USC,
79500	86100	is one of the more prestigious educational institutes in the world, which specialises in business, performing arts, and engineering.
86100	92100	And if I asked you, my audience, what you think it would take to obtain entry into such a coveted establishment,
92100	96700	you might say, I don't know, good grades, strong SATs.
96700	100900	According to court documents, she and Bella's father, designer Mossimo Giannulli,
100900	110100	resorted to bribes, because Bella's academic qualifications were at, or just below, the low end of USC's admission standards.
110100	113500	A willingness to learn, strong work ethic,
113500	120900	But I do want the experience of like, game days, partying, I don't really care about school, as you guys all know.
120900	125300	And of course, no meddling, and no corruption whatsoever.
125300	133500	Her famous parents, who live in this sprawling mansion in LA, are charged with spending half a million dollars in bribes to get their daughters into USC.
133500	137700	Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you, Olivia Jade.
137700	143300	Olivia Jade is a YouTuber, a beauty, fashion, and lifestyle YouTuber, to be more precise.
143300	148500	She makes videos, in which she sometimes buys expensive items, sometimes buys cheaper items,
148500	156300	does fun, quirky challenges, publishes tutorials for her adoring, loving fan base, and even more excitingly, collapse.
156300	162900	Sometimes with her friends, sometimes with more popular YouTubers, but sometimes, and most interestingly, with her mother,
162900	167300	who is also deeply involved in the topic today. Her mother is actress Lori Loughlin.
167300	171900	If you've watched any mid-tier TV show, then you'll probably be familiar with her face,
171900	174900	because that's the market that she has decided to dominate.
174900	179700	Lori's husband is Massimo Giannulli, the founder of the Massimo Fashion House.
179700	185100	So with all that talent in the genes, she must have success running through her veins, right?
185100	186300	Let's discuss that.
186300	191300	Because Olivia Jade was a student at the prolific University of Southern California,
191300	197100	and on top of this, it appears that she was a competitive rower, with athletic credentials to boot.
197100	203700	However, all was not as it seems, as in March 2019, she was involved in a huge scandal,
203700	209500	which alleged that certain families had been bribing various institutions to enable admission,
209500	211900	where they may not have obtained it otherwise.
211900	217500	In the midst of this, Olivia Jade's parents were amongst those indicted for their participation in the scandal.
217500	221300	Now, in the instance of many of these children, because they weren't public figures,
221300	227700	the attention was primarily and almost solely on their parents, as they were considerably higher profile,
227700	231900	the exception in this situation being our good friend here, Olivia Jade.
231900	236500	It seems that the only rowing Olivia Jade will be doing is up Shit Creek without the paddle.
236500	241300	The publication of this led to immediate backlash spilling all over onto her channel,
241300	245100	and subsequently causing her to practically disappear from social media,
245100	250700	disabling comments on her Instagram and YouTube account, and laying low throughout the public uproar.
250700	255500	On top of this, many sponsors who had worked with her in the past made the decision to cease relations,
255500	257700	including Sephora and Tresemme.
257700	261900	She has suffered, and many would argue justifiably so.
261900	265300	Unfortunately, when you're a public figure preaching on your content,
265300	269900	when people claim you're involved in a corrupt scheme, many don't just feel annoyed, but betrayed,
269900	273300	that a person who may have inspired them was not who they claim to be.
273300	276100	In the heat of the moment, and with the outrage brimming,
276100	281100	it was probably understandable that many people wanted to go in on her for the whole situation.
281100	285700	But as always, at The Right Opinion, we go deeper than I go in Primink.
285700	288700	Sorry, inside joke. Literally.
288700	292100	On the surface, this is a fairly cut and dry situation.
292100	296700	Bribery is bad, and I'm not just here to come to the conclusion that bribery is bad,
296700	301300	and we shouldn't participate in it, because that's bloody obvious, I think.
301300	302900	Damn you, contrarians.
302900	307500	But there is a bit more, because as the daughter, and as a YouTuber,
307500	312300	a person who has a closer relationship with their viewers than any of the actual celebrities,
312300	315100	she has faced unbelievable amounts of backlash.
315100	320900	And on top of that, many narratives that much of her content has been completely compromised due to the scandal.
320900	326900	However, on the other hand, many people have been criticised for jumping to conclusions too quickly.
326900	330100	And at the time, without information on Olivia Jade's involvement,
330100	333300	it seemed unfair to hone in all the criticism on her,
333300	337300	when it's clear there are other individuals who are much more conscious of their activity,
337300	341100	and are probably more responsible for the situation we observed in the headlines.
341100	346500	I want to take these narratives, exposit some cultural observations, conduct some investigative work,
346500	351300	gather some background, and hopefully really provide some evaluations of the actual case,
351300	355100	to see if we can come to a conclusion about Olivia Jade's involvement,
355100	360500	and subsequently state if the response that many have directed towards her has been justified.
360500	363100	And what is the best course of action for her?
363100	367300	Obviously, this won't be discussing the extreme responses, which are never really welcome,
367300	371700	but I do trust that a majority of responses did not reflect that mentality.
371700	376300	So now I've explained my plan, I think it's best we begin to carry it out.
376300	377300	Let's go.
385100	388700	Olivia Jade started out her channel in 2014.
388700	392700	She started it with a plan to have it as mostly beauty-oriented,
392700	395700	with her opening video sort of laying that out,
395700	401300	over the copyright-free ukulele music that definitely does not make me suffer or want to die.
401300	405900	I've been wanting to make this channel for so long now, and I'm so happy I've finally gotten around to doing it.
405900	407500	Please come down below!
407500	409500	These videos were generally harmless,
409500	413700	and it does legitimately seem like she has an interest in the content she's making.
413700	416100	Just someone talking about the stuff that she wants to do.
416100	419900	She had this early Q&A where she was asked why she started her YouTube channel.
419900	423500	Kelly257, what got you into YouTube?
423500	427100	Well, I don't know. I just wanted to make one so I did.
427100	429100	Clearly a sign of motivation.
429100	432700	Now, besides the god-awful musical choices that have become stuck in my ears
432700	435300	and will probably need hours of Elton John to cleanse it,
435300	438900	nothing particularly stood out to me as offensive in what she did at first.
438900	442900	She was your typical girl with a decent ability in the socialising area.
442900	446900	However, at the same time, she never really came across as anything more.
446900	450500	Although she was nothing offensive, she was also rather flavourless.
450500	453500	What do you want to be when you're older, and what college do you want to attend?
453500	455300	So I have no idea with college.
455300	457700	Well, that's Asia well.
457700	459500	Hi Jess, but my point stands.
459500	464100	She's just the sort of aimless vlogger with nothing particularly exceptional about her personally.
464100	469700	So how did she end up gathering the momentum that she has today, or at least prior to the beginning of March?
469700	472700	I mean, the short answer is that she's loaded like a mofo.
472700	474300	But I want to expand on this too.
474300	477100	Many vloggers are built on a fairly simple concept.
477100	479500	Their lifestyle has something we desire.
479500	483900	It often provides a window for many audience members to live through and aspire to,
483900	488500	and this gives the upper hand to many people who have at least some sort of step up.
488500	490500	Now let me make this absolutely clear.
490500	493500	Being rich does not predispose you to vlogging success.
493500	498300	As much as starting off with very little doesn't mean you can't gain a foothold in what you're doing.
498300	504700	But having a famous family member that you can parade on your channel is definitely an advantage that Olivia made the most of,
504700	505500	and it shows.
505500	510500	In her first videos, the best performing content were the videos where she featured her mother.
510500	516700	Out of the first set of uploads, these videos completely outshone all the other content in their performance,
516700	520100	because they offered something that other creators really couldn't.
520100	521500	Famous people. Wow!
521500	526700	You know these days how many people will complain that YouTube has essentially become a platform
526700	533700	that pushes already established celebrities over the wholesome grassroots content that anyone can support themselves with.
533700	537700	Well, it was 2014 when Olivia Jade set her channel up.
537700	540300	Is it not fair to ask what was different exactly?
540300	548500	Well, to completely understand that, we have to ask ourselves about the problem that many people have with celebrities who are currently dominating the platform.
548500	554500	In my opinion, the main problem that many people have with the current wave of creators is that philosophically speaking,
554500	562100	YouTube has an organic appeal that means to a lot of the audiences the idea that there's a playing field in which everyone starts on zero.
562100	567500	If someone joined YouTube and YouTube just gave them a million subscribers, people would be kind of pissed off.
567500	571300	And although that's not exactly what happens when other celebrities enter the platform,
571300	576500	it often feels like they bring such a reputation with them that it gives them an unfair advantage.
576500	584300	Now this is not something that I'm exactly concerned about because I don't believe that many of these celebrities can really adapt to the truly authentic environment.
584300	591100	I personally believe that there will always be an audience for creators who have constantly lived on the pedestal that stardom often brings.
591100	596700	However, I understand why it frustrates people that YouTube throws its weight behind such content like it's the future.
596700	603300	The thing about Olivia Jade is that she didn't piss people off because she hadn't established herself in any other industry at that point.
603300	609100	And therefore, even if she had both an advantage and a gimmick in the fact that her mother was relatively famous,
609100	613700	she hadn't established a reputation as a celebrity outside of the platform.
613700	621500	Celebrities are relatively alienated from the general public and therefore have to develop a top-down relationship when they construct these YouTube channels.
621500	626500	Whereas people like Olivia Jade were building relationships to the audience from the bottom up.
626500	631500	And although she definitely had a privilege in that she was more than ready to spend for cheeky giveaways,
631500	637900	she flew under the radar because many of these advantages were much more implicit and she wasn't known prior to the platform.
637900	644500	I've been there and every other YouTuber that you watch and that's your favorite has also been there, I can almost guarantee it.
644500	649300	No one starts out with a million subscribers, no one starts out with a hundred thousand, no one even starts out with ten subscribers.
649300	652100	You start from zero. You have to work yourself up that way.
652100	659500	So if it's something you're passionate about and something you actually like doing and you're not doing it to get famous or like whatever, become an influencer, make this your job.
659500	667000	If you're actually doing it because you like doing it, I think you're gonna get really far and you just have to be persistent and tell yourself like,
667000	668600	Okay, like I'm doing this because I like it.
668600	675100	Yet those subtle advantages allowed her to establish herself as a well-off beauty blogger that was also your girl next door.
675100	684300	A rather strange dynamic when you think about it, but one that works in these instances because we like people who we can relate to and even imagine ourselves in their position.
684300	690100	She's a laid-back kind of girl who's doing well for herself but can bond with people using universal topics.
690100	695300	That's the sort of balance you need for a protagonist and why someone like, for example, Bobby Misner doesn't work.
695300	699500	People who make a big deal out of their privilege are not particularly well liked.
699500	703500	At the end of the day, Olivia Jade is just a passive result of the system.
703500	708600	At first, the only real appeal that she seemed to pertain was the fact that she was related to famous people.
708600	714900	However, eventually the rest of her content began to perform well because the other key appeal that many people enjoy is the clout.
714900	723200	There's a reason that people who otherwise have nothing really going for them like Lance Stewart managed to acquire millions of views beyond just the clickbait.
723200	731600	When we watch vlogs, because they are a window into someone's life, once they gain some sort of momentum and fan base, it becomes appealing to want to interact with them,
731600	734700	even if the content that they're pumping out is fairly mindless.
734700	741000	With that said, I wouldn't say Olivia Jade's videos were anything particularly bad, and she did have some neat concepts that she played with.
741000	745800	If I was going to prom and wanted a lovely dress, maybe her suggestions would be useful.
745800	749800	A lot of her videos were fairly standard, but it's clear what her appeal is.
749800	758800	It's the juxtaposition between someone who's famous, but at the same time down-to-earth and not above-us plebeians, giving us some insight about what it's like to live that life.
758800	762300	It gives us the sort of impression that they are, just like us.
762300	771400	She's just a girl with a bit more money, and she's doing with that money what you do with that money as well, and she wants to help you right down that road too, right?
772400	777400	Mm-hmm. I think it's best we talk about the next spicy part.
780800	785800	Most YouTube audiences don't hate people for the sake of being rich.
785800	790800	Hell, in many instances, we welcome the diversity of the lifestyle that they can show to us.
790800	799800	It can provide us with some pretty great entertainment, and if that can help provide some escapism from people's often depressing daily lives, then who the hell am I to talk it down?
799800	808800	However, at the same time, we like to be under some perception that these guys are like us, have to answer to the same system as us, and play the same ballgame as us.
808800	817800	And although this is seldom actually the case, it would cause far too much stress to the average viewer to be picking apart every subtle privilege that many of these creators might have access to.
817800	827800	Equally, a creator in that position may be pretty ignorant to the political complexities that come with such discourse, and just want to entertain people, and that's also fair enough.
827800	835800	At the end of the day, we want to see the circumstance as not necessarily defining the person, even if it does, of course, influence them.
835800	842800	However, when these privileges are taken advantage of and do fall into the public eye, they cause a whirlwind of outrage,
842800	849800	because this creator, who has sold themselves on the platform that this lovely, relatable person has their platform undermined,
849800	856800	and today's situation is probably one of the worst examples of that. Let's indulge ourselves in the details then.
856800	861800	So at around the start of March, we became aware that there was a transpiring incident occurring,
861800	865800	with one of the people being involved our little vlog darling, Olivia Jade.
865800	875800	As explained earlier, the headlines read that Olivia Jade had been involved in a bribery scheme that had gained her admission to the prestigious University of Southern California,
875800	878800	and there was immediate backlash driven by very strong sentiments.
878800	883800	This is all important, and we'll definitely discuss the justification of that in a bit,
883800	888800	but for the moment, I want to actually lay down the details, because many of them have been filtered out by the media.
888800	894800	The golden question that matters to me is how complicit or aware was Olivia Jade in all of this.
894800	898800	To do that, we're pulling up the indictment documents and creating a timeline.
898800	906800	For those who are interested, I'll be leaving a link to the document amongst the references as usual, in case you would like to see the full context.
906800	909800	Olivia Jade's application begins around page 91.
909800	912800	We're in July 2017 right now.
912800	918800	Olivia Jade's sister had just been admitted to USC under similar bribery related pretenses,
918800	922800	and the family were prepared to go through the same system of application again.
922800	929800	The individual, named CW1 in this instance, is helping them create a fraudulent profile for their daughter,
929800	932800	that will enable them to gain entry to the university.
932800	934800	How are they going to do this?
934800	936800	Well, they're going to fabricate rowing credentials.
936800	940800	To do this, they need to send every single detail possible to make it look valid,
940800	943800	and this is where a very important element comes in,
943800	948800	because one of those details was a photo of Olivia Jade at an ergometer,
948800	953800	which can mean a few things, but in this instance, it is typically referring to an indoor rowing machine.
953800	959800	It seems that Olivia must have had some conscious knowledge that something, something may have been going on.
959800	966800	In some cases, children were excused as ignorant due to the fact that they may have been doing it under the pretense of a photoshoot,
966800	972800	and this is not an impossible defense here, but it's certainly something that Olivia would need to probably provide an explanation of
972800	975800	if she wanted to gain the empathy of her audience.
975800	978800	So she was approved through the subcommittee in November,
978800	983800	and there was a congratulatory email, and money was transferred, all fairly routine.
983800	987800	However, the testimony does contain another very curious detail.
987800	992800	The informant in this instance, CW1, claims that a guidance counselor at the high school
992800	997800	confronted Olivia about her and her sister's credentials for their application,
997800	1000800	as they did not believe they were legitimate.
1000800	1005800	What was said in that conversation, we cannot be certain, but if true, it is fairly incriminating.
1005800	1011800	This is just a testimony. However, what makes for even more compelling evidence further to this,
1011800	1017800	is that in November, the mother, Laurie, cc'd their younger daughter, Olivia Jade,
1017800	1021800	in an email to the informant, requesting help to complete the application,
1021800	1026800	without the attention of their quote, little friend at the high school.
1026800	1032800	This was subsequently resolved in a following email, stating that USC was surprised to hear that there was a concern.
1032800	1036800	This is complemented with another voicemail from one of the participants in the scheme,
1036800	1042800	Donna Hanel, the now former athletic director, to try and make sure the scheme wasn't found out.
1042800	1044800	So this is all going on right now.
1044800	1047800	The parents' participation was exposed through a sting operation,
1047800	1052800	the documented calls in which the parents make fairly candid admissions of their involvement.
1052800	1057800	The girls themselves aren't directly involved in these calls, but with everything considered,
1057800	1061800	it makes it hard to deny that there must be some awareness from Olivia Jade,
1061800	1067800	unless she really did not ask any questions, or make any assumptions at all.
1067800	1073800	But I doubt many people would buy that, in spite of the responses that she has made disassociating herself.
1073800	1079800	The whole situation has soured the perception towards her, and placed some statements in a new light.
1079800	1086800	But I do want the experience of like, game days, partying, I don't really care about school, as you guys all know.
1086800	1089800	Now normally, this would not be a big deal.
1089800	1093800	There are a lot of people who go to university without a great work ethic,
1093800	1100800	and in a way, if you were a popular YouTuber, maybe you would just want to get through and have a good time while you're at it.
1100800	1104800	But the thing is, this is not just an incredibly prestigious university,
1104800	1110800	but Jade also entered on the basis of athletic exceptionalism, something that would take immense effort,
1110800	1114800	and many of those admissions are typically done on a selective basis,
1114800	1118800	and if they obtained it, it is very possible that someone else was likely denied it,
1118800	1122800	someone else who firstly deserved it more, and probably needed it more as well.
1122800	1126800	Equally, it does compromise Olivia Jade's rhetoric at other points.
1126800	1133800	He's honestly really helpful, I can just look at that for inspiration, I guess, and seeing that hard work does pay off.
1133800	1137800	He didn't come from a lot, so it's cool to see that he built it all himself.
1137800	1141800	She's just ruined whatever perception people previously had of her.
1141800	1148800	If she was going for the party girl who wants to have a good time, then she shouldn't be cheating the system trying to portray herself as anything else,
1148800	1153800	and if she was going for the girl who's always on the grind, then she shouldn't be partaking in an elitist scheme
1153800	1157800	that is for people who are basically too lazy, too lazy or too unskilled,
1157800	1163800	and completely benefits off the back of the parent income, and none of her actual own work whatsoever.
1163800	1167800	And that's what is the worst about this situation, it is the pinnacle of laziness,
1167800	1172800	and I want to take this forward prior to providing some personal thoughts on the situation.
1172800	1178800	This is an issue that resonates with me a lot, because I applied for a very prestigious university,
1178800	1183800	and I made it through to the final interview stage before being rejected.
1183800	1187800	Given how hard I worked for it, and given how many hurdles I had faced,
1187800	1192800	not just to do with the application, but due to all the complications, real life interference, and so on,
1192800	1199800	it made me so bitter when they rejected me, and it made me even more bitter when I found out who had been accepted,
1199800	1204800	because it didn't make sense to me, and as the following year turned to be one of the worst years in my life,
1204800	1209800	I continuously linked it back to that stage and re-ran every single thing.
1209800	1214800	What went wrong? What could I have done better? Did I even do anything wrong? Was the system corrupt?
1214800	1219800	When this situation arose, it did not surprise me, because when you have people who know people,
1219800	1225800	and various other positions of power, it's very easily corrupted, because people want the best for their family,
1225800	1230800	often to the point where they're willing to pull a few strings, and when you're aware of the strings being pulled,
1230800	1234800	you want to pull them too, and then it becomes a string pulling contest,
1234800	1238800	and the only people who lose are the people who don't have the ability to pull the strings,
1238800	1245800	the people who don't have that privilege, many people who look towards you in the first place for that guidance.
1245800	1250800	There have been reports saying that it's unclear if Olivia Jade knew or not about the scheme.
1250800	1257800	To me, it's a bit clearer. It seems to me that Olivia Jade would have to have been extremely ignorant and unassuming,
1257800	1263800	if she didn't at least have some knowledge of this, and she's going to have to respond to a lot of the details
1263800	1266800	if she wants to gain back the fans that she's lost.
1266800	1272800	It seems incredible to me that she has a YouTube following, her own brand, successful parents,
1272800	1277800	and still, they wanted her to have more. With this in mind, it's very difficult for me to have sympathy,
1277800	1284800	because it was not an action justified by desperation at no other option, it was an action justified by greed.
1284800	1290800	And of course, her parents are definitely the greatest influencers in this, but when she's the prime beneficiary of the scheme,
1290800	1294800	she can't be surprised to have some responsibility at her doorstep.
1294800	1300800	She obviously doesn't deserve the cruel comments and so on, but I don't think it's fair for outlets to scope in on that,
1300800	1303800	as if it encompasses the situation or the criticism.
1303800	1308800	Most comments typically encompass a very snarky attitude to a lack of growing qualification,
1308800	1312800	and I'm one to have commented in the past when I think outrage can go too far,
1312800	1317800	but this is the stuff that many people have a personal connection with, because many of us have gone through the system,
1317800	1319800	and we want it to be fair.
1319800	1325800	It's a real shame we live in a world where many people will feel completely defined by the university they attend,
1325800	1328800	to the point that some are willing to play dirty just to get into them.
1328800	1330800	And it's not like I don't understand.
1330800	1336800	You look at many of the top performing people in certain areas, and many of them have attended the same circle of institutes,
1336800	1339800	but they are in that position for a reason, and you are not.
1339800	1341800	As for the parents, well...
1341800	1344800	Yeah, I did some really shady s*** when I was younger.
1344800	1349800	I don't know how I didn't get caught for it. I... lucky I'm alive and breathing.
1349800	1355800	Really, the only thing was for me was like about safety, like don't Uber by yourself, don't dah dah dah dah, like be classy,
1355800	1358800	you only get one reputation, like that whole sort of thing.
1358800	1362800	The mother in this instance started as the source of her daughter's success,
1362800	1367800	and ultimately was the source of this conflict that has caused the hiatus and damage to the channel.
1367800	1371800	And unfortunately, it's not like people are going to want to see her back on the channel.
1371800	1374800	Maybe for a quick jail cell interview, that might pull views.
1374800	1376800	But it wouldn't create prolonging credibility.
1376800	1381800	The parents tried to give the children an advantage, but now have actually impacted their chances,
1381800	1383800	because they're going to live with that stigma.
1383800	1387800	Especially Olivia Jade, as someone who is well known to many people.
1387800	1390800	Whether that's deserved or not, it's a legacy that will sting.
1390800	1396800	Olivia Jade is probably just a person who's used to receiving good things without asking questions,
1396800	1399800	and she thought she'd not ask questions and take what she can get.
1399800	1403800	However, as many of us have found, that is seldom the best route to take.
1403800	1406800	Olivia Jade is not just a public figure, but she's a YouTube figure.
1406800	1408800	She's not the same as your typical celebrity.
1408800	1412800	She has that close relationship, people look towards her for guidance.
1412800	1415800	We idolise these people, whether they want that or not.
1415800	1418800	These are clearly private matters in many ways,
1418800	1421800	however they spill over onto her public reputation,
1421800	1426800	as they compromise what she claimed to have stood for, and what many people saw her as.
1426800	1429800	When we see a public figure embroiled in these controversies,
1429800	1433800	although I don't think it should necessarily spell the end of their career,
1433800	1435800	because people can learn and grow,
1435800	1440800	it might be worth taking a few months away from YouTube to focus on the education side of things.
1440800	1443800	I personally think that she should withdraw from the university,
1443800	1445800	and she should rerun the application system,
1445800	1450800	because it's clear there need to be more repercussions for people who might consider this scheme in the future.
1450800	1453800	We shouldn't merely be at ease that this has been found out,
1453800	1455800	because it's likely just a fraction of it.
1455800	1458800	There is probably many more schemes going on.
1458800	1460800	I mean, it was reported at the time this transpired,
1460800	1466800	Olivia Jade was on the USC's Chairman of the Board of Trustees $100 million yacht.
1466800	1471800	Now, besides the question of how someone can spend $100 million on a bloody yacht,
1471800	1474800	it should really be a red flag that these elite links lie deep.
1474800	1479800	On top of this, the fact that Olivia Jade has now been proven to be at the university under false pretenses,
1479800	1481800	and given all the media attention,
1481800	1486800	it might be genuinely beneficial for her to drop out and actually demonstrate some self-sufficiency.
1486800	1489800	She's going to be alright regardless of the situation.
1489800	1493800	Her parents are clearly successful, and it may be somewhat validating for herself,
1493800	1496800	rather than having this reputation hang over her.
1496800	1500800	However, by the looks of it, the university will be keeping her in attendance,
1500800	1502800	so that will be down to her own decision,
1502800	1505800	and it will be down to other people to judge it on their own basis.
1505800	1508800	If she does choose to stay, and if she's allowed to stay,
1508800	1513800	I'd recommend working a bit harder, because you may well be standing in someone else's place.
1513800	1518800	I'm sure many people watching this video today have cheated in a test at some point in their life,
1518800	1521800	but the difference is, that's something that anyone can do,
1521800	1526800	and most people do on a much smaller scale, with a much lesser effect.
1526800	1529800	I said this at the start of the video, people have privileges.
1529800	1533800	Some are obtained within society's bounds that we can look past to her position,
1533800	1535800	due to her status as an entertainer,
1535800	1540800	but Olivia Jade benefited from a privilege that took advantage of the system,
1540800	1545800	and therefore, her chill, laid-back persona no longer seemed like it was just your rich girl
1545800	1548800	doing what anyone else would do, while still getting that bread.
1548800	1553800	It felt like it was a girl who didn't have to do anything, because her position was too secure.
1553800	1558800	Even if it's not on camera, we want to know that people are gonna go through the same system as us.
1558800	1561800	We would like the world to be balanced. It's not.
1561800	1567800	When people who preach it to their followers are showed to not stand by those principles themselves, it annoys us.
1567800	1570800	This isn't just a bad decision, this isn't just hypocritical,
1570800	1574800	this has been a long played-out scenario which was calculated and conducted.
1574800	1578800	It is bad. Olivia Jade has so much of her life ahead of her.
1578800	1581800	I take this as a serious learning experience,
1581800	1587800	and recommend getting in touch with the hard work that people actually do to get a position at the university,
1587800	1591800	because this seems like it's either an outcome of being seriously out of touch,
1591800	1594800	or lacking empathy for others who work far too hard.
1594800	1597800	That's sometimes what having copious amounts of money,
1597800	1602800	a fanbase who seldom challenge you, and parents who will go too far for your protection will foster,
1602800	1608800	and it's definitely something we should discuss if we want to create a world of people that actually look out for each other.
1608800	1611800	It sounds corny, but it's true, and it's what I believe in.
1611800	1615800	I hope she sorts herself out and manages to respond to some of the points discussed today,
1615800	1622800	because after this investigation, it does seem like what she established herself as is somewhat compromised,
1622800	1626800	and a lot of the upset from people who admired her is kinda justified.
1626800	1629800	I don't think her YouTube channel is an industry plant,
1629800	1633800	and it doesn't seem like she's just another celebrity trying to be relatable.
1633800	1636800	It seems like she does genuinely care about the videos she makes,
1636800	1640800	but she's certainly alienated a lot of her audience through this scheme,
1640800	1645800	because otherwise, we wouldn't picture her as the sort of person to be involved in that sort of stuff.
1645800	1647800	The sponsors will come back, the money will come back,
1647800	1650800	but I think it will be down to her to bring the integrity back,
1650800	1653800	and I think personally, that's the honourable thing to do.
1653800	1658800	Oh, and one more thing before I finish. Bribery is bad. Thank you.
1662800	1665800	So, that's the video. Hope you guys enjoyed.
1665800	1668800	Would love to hear your thoughts on the situation in the comments section below.
1668800	1673800	Really interesting one, and I hope that I've covered it in a bit more detail than some other people have.
1673800	1675800	I would like to give a big shoutout to the editors.
1675800	1681800	They have once again done a stellar, stellar, stellar, stellar, stellar, stellar, stellar, stellar, stellar job,
1681800	1683800	and I'm gonna link them in the pinned comment.
1683800	1688800	Go and check their channels out, or whatever links they put there, and send them some love.
1688800	1691800	They've done a fantastic job. Fantastic job.
1691800	1695800	Secondly, I wanna give big thanks to the Patreons, who've been very generous, as always.
1695800	1700800	Need to give personal thanks to Evening Steel, who's on $50.
1700800	1705800	Connor, who's also on $50, and Sumhala Baloo, who's also on $50.
1705800	1710800	And on $100 is Brandon again. What a mad lad.
1710800	1714800	You are truly a legend, and I appreciate you a lot. Thank you.
1714800	1720800	If you wanna just chat with me, you can hit me up on Twitter, at The Right Opinion, on Facebook, on Discord.
1720800	1723800	I do my best to be responsive there, too.
1723800	1728800	I don't really have too much else to say today, so I just hope you're having a fantastic week, whatever day this goes up.
1728800	1732800	I love you lots, and I appreciate you guys a lot. I will see you in the next one.
1735800	1753800	Thanks for watching!
