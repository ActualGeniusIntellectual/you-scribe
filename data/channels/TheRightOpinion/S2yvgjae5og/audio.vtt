00:00.000 --> 00:05.900
The big question, not just what happens to the parents, but also the children who benefited from the cheating scandal.

00:05.900 --> 00:10.900
And well before the scandal broke, Olivia Giannulli was famous for her presence on social media.

00:10.900 --> 00:14.100
Well now she's become target number one for public outrage.

00:19.100 --> 00:24.100
Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time.

00:24.100 --> 00:29.900
And today we are talking about the education system, and a YouTuber who cut a few corners.

00:29.900 --> 00:30.700
Hooray.

00:30.700 --> 00:35.800
You see my friends, I attend university, or college as the Americans love to call it.

00:35.800 --> 00:41.600
Exciting I know, behind basically everything else in my life, education is my favourite activity.

00:41.600 --> 00:48.600
However, I'm not here to discuss how much I definitely love my courses, because for all I know, the tutors might be watching.

00:48.600 --> 00:54.600
But if you are, give me good grades, or else my next video might be on you, and I might just cross my arms.

00:54.600 --> 00:58.300
As always, the subjects I cover have a YouTube twist thrown in,

00:58.300 --> 01:01.700
and today is no exception, because we are going to university.

01:01.700 --> 01:04.700
Hooray, get your degree, and come on in.

01:04.700 --> 01:07.900
But more importantly to the University of Southern California,

01:07.900 --> 01:13.900
to a situation that has garnered a lot of attention recently, and a YouTuber who has been at the centre of it.

01:13.900 --> 01:19.500
Now to provide some background for you twats, the University of Southern California, abbreviated to USC,

01:19.500 --> 01:26.100
is one of the more prestigious educational institutes in the world, which specialises in business, performing arts, and engineering.

01:26.100 --> 01:32.100
And if I asked you, my audience, what you think it would take to obtain entry into such a coveted establishment,

01:32.100 --> 01:36.700
you might say, I don't know, good grades, strong SATs.

01:36.700 --> 01:40.900
According to court documents, she and Bella's father, designer Mossimo Giannulli,

01:40.900 --> 01:50.100
resorted to bribes, because Bella's academic qualifications were at, or just below, the low end of USC's admission standards.

01:50.100 --> 01:53.500
A willingness to learn, strong work ethic,

01:53.500 --> 02:00.900
But I do want the experience of like, game days, partying, I don't really care about school, as you guys all know.

02:00.900 --> 02:05.300
And of course, no meddling, and no corruption whatsoever.

02:05.300 --> 02:13.500
Her famous parents, who live in this sprawling mansion in LA, are charged with spending half a million dollars in bribes to get their daughters into USC.

02:13.500 --> 02:17.700
Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you, Olivia Jade.

02:17.700 --> 02:23.300
Olivia Jade is a YouTuber, a beauty, fashion, and lifestyle YouTuber, to be more precise.

02:23.300 --> 02:28.500
She makes videos, in which she sometimes buys expensive items, sometimes buys cheaper items,

02:28.500 --> 02:36.300
does fun, quirky challenges, publishes tutorials for her adoring, loving fan base, and even more excitingly, collapse.

02:36.300 --> 02:42.900
Sometimes with her friends, sometimes with more popular YouTubers, but sometimes, and most interestingly, with her mother,

02:42.900 --> 02:47.300
who is also deeply involved in the topic today. Her mother is actress Lori Loughlin.

02:47.300 --> 02:51.900
If you've watched any mid-tier TV show, then you'll probably be familiar with her face,

02:51.900 --> 02:54.900
because that's the market that she has decided to dominate.

02:54.900 --> 02:59.700
Lori's husband is Massimo Giannulli, the founder of the Massimo Fashion House.

02:59.700 --> 03:05.100
So with all that talent in the genes, she must have success running through her veins, right?

03:05.100 --> 03:06.300
Let's discuss that.

03:06.300 --> 03:11.300
Because Olivia Jade was a student at the prolific University of Southern California,

03:11.300 --> 03:17.100
and on top of this, it appears that she was a competitive rower, with athletic credentials to boot.

03:17.100 --> 03:23.700
However, all was not as it seems, as in March 2019, she was involved in a huge scandal,

03:23.700 --> 03:29.500
which alleged that certain families had been bribing various institutions to enable admission,

03:29.500 --> 03:31.900
where they may not have obtained it otherwise.

03:31.900 --> 03:37.500
In the midst of this, Olivia Jade's parents were amongst those indicted for their participation in the scandal.

03:37.500 --> 03:41.300
Now, in the instance of many of these children, because they weren't public figures,

03:41.300 --> 03:47.700
the attention was primarily and almost solely on their parents, as they were considerably higher profile,

03:47.700 --> 03:51.900
the exception in this situation being our good friend here, Olivia Jade.

03:51.900 --> 03:56.500
It seems that the only rowing Olivia Jade will be doing is up Shit Creek without the paddle.

03:56.500 --> 04:01.300
The publication of this led to immediate backlash spilling all over onto her channel,

04:01.300 --> 04:05.100
and subsequently causing her to practically disappear from social media,

04:05.100 --> 04:10.700
disabling comments on her Instagram and YouTube account, and laying low throughout the public uproar.

04:10.700 --> 04:15.500
On top of this, many sponsors who had worked with her in the past made the decision to cease relations,

04:15.500 --> 04:17.700
including Sephora and Tresemme.

04:17.700 --> 04:21.900
She has suffered, and many would argue justifiably so.

04:21.900 --> 04:25.300
Unfortunately, when you're a public figure preaching on your content,

04:25.300 --> 04:29.900
when people claim you're involved in a corrupt scheme, many don't just feel annoyed, but betrayed,

04:29.900 --> 04:33.300
that a person who may have inspired them was not who they claim to be.

04:33.300 --> 04:36.100
In the heat of the moment, and with the outrage brimming,

04:36.100 --> 04:41.100
it was probably understandable that many people wanted to go in on her for the whole situation.

04:41.100 --> 04:45.700
But as always, at The Right Opinion, we go deeper than I go in Primink.

04:45.700 --> 04:48.700
Sorry, inside joke. Literally.

04:48.700 --> 04:52.100
On the surface, this is a fairly cut and dry situation.

04:52.100 --> 04:56.700
Bribery is bad, and I'm not just here to come to the conclusion that bribery is bad,

04:56.700 --> 05:01.300
and we shouldn't participate in it, because that's bloody obvious, I think.

05:01.300 --> 05:02.900
Damn you, contrarians.

05:02.900 --> 05:07.500
But there is a bit more, because as the daughter, and as a YouTuber,

05:07.500 --> 05:12.300
a person who has a closer relationship with their viewers than any of the actual celebrities,

05:12.300 --> 05:15.100
she has faced unbelievable amounts of backlash.

05:15.100 --> 05:20.900
And on top of that, many narratives that much of her content has been completely compromised due to the scandal.

05:20.900 --> 05:26.900
However, on the other hand, many people have been criticised for jumping to conclusions too quickly.

05:26.900 --> 05:30.100
And at the time, without information on Olivia Jade's involvement,

05:30.100 --> 05:33.300
it seemed unfair to hone in all the criticism on her,

05:33.300 --> 05:37.300
when it's clear there are other individuals who are much more conscious of their activity,

05:37.300 --> 05:41.100
and are probably more responsible for the situation we observed in the headlines.

05:41.100 --> 05:46.500
I want to take these narratives, exposit some cultural observations, conduct some investigative work,

05:46.500 --> 05:51.300
gather some background, and hopefully really provide some evaluations of the actual case,

05:51.300 --> 05:55.100
to see if we can come to a conclusion about Olivia Jade's involvement,

05:55.100 --> 06:00.500
and subsequently state if the response that many have directed towards her has been justified.

06:00.500 --> 06:03.100
And what is the best course of action for her?

06:03.100 --> 06:07.300
Obviously, this won't be discussing the extreme responses, which are never really welcome,

06:07.300 --> 06:11.700
but I do trust that a majority of responses did not reflect that mentality.

06:11.700 --> 06:16.300
So now I've explained my plan, I think it's best we begin to carry it out.

06:16.300 --> 06:17.300
Let's go.

06:25.100 --> 06:28.700
Olivia Jade started out her channel in 2014.

06:28.700 --> 06:32.700
She started it with a plan to have it as mostly beauty-oriented,

06:32.700 --> 06:35.700
with her opening video sort of laying that out,

06:35.700 --> 06:41.300
over the copyright-free ukulele music that definitely does not make me suffer or want to die.

06:41.300 --> 06:45.900
I've been wanting to make this channel for so long now, and I'm so happy I've finally gotten around to doing it.

06:45.900 --> 06:47.500
Please come down below!

06:47.500 --> 06:49.500
These videos were generally harmless,

06:49.500 --> 06:53.700
and it does legitimately seem like she has an interest in the content she's making.

06:53.700 --> 06:56.100
Just someone talking about the stuff that she wants to do.

06:56.100 --> 06:59.900
She had this early Q&A where she was asked why she started her YouTube channel.

06:59.900 --> 07:03.500
Kelly257, what got you into YouTube?

07:03.500 --> 07:07.100
Well, I don't know. I just wanted to make one so I did.

07:07.100 --> 07:09.100
Clearly a sign of motivation.

07:09.100 --> 07:12.700
Now, besides the god-awful musical choices that have become stuck in my ears

07:12.700 --> 07:15.300
and will probably need hours of Elton John to cleanse it,

07:15.300 --> 07:18.900
nothing particularly stood out to me as offensive in what she did at first.

07:18.900 --> 07:22.900
She was your typical girl with a decent ability in the socialising area.

07:22.900 --> 07:26.900
However, at the same time, she never really came across as anything more.

07:26.900 --> 07:30.500
Although she was nothing offensive, she was also rather flavourless.

07:30.500 --> 07:33.500
What do you want to be when you're older, and what college do you want to attend?

07:33.500 --> 07:35.300
So I have no idea with college.

07:35.300 --> 07:37.700
Well, that's Asia well.

07:37.700 --> 07:39.500
Hi Jess, but my point stands.

07:39.500 --> 07:44.100
She's just the sort of aimless vlogger with nothing particularly exceptional about her personally.

07:44.100 --> 07:49.700
So how did she end up gathering the momentum that she has today, or at least prior to the beginning of March?

07:49.700 --> 07:52.700
I mean, the short answer is that she's loaded like a mofo.

07:52.700 --> 07:54.300
But I want to expand on this too.

07:54.300 --> 07:57.100
Many vloggers are built on a fairly simple concept.

07:57.100 --> 07:59.500
Their lifestyle has something we desire.

07:59.500 --> 08:03.900
It often provides a window for many audience members to live through and aspire to,

08:03.900 --> 08:08.500
and this gives the upper hand to many people who have at least some sort of step up.

08:08.500 --> 08:10.500
Now let me make this absolutely clear.

08:10.500 --> 08:13.500
Being rich does not predispose you to vlogging success.

08:13.500 --> 08:18.300
As much as starting off with very little doesn't mean you can't gain a foothold in what you're doing.

08:18.300 --> 08:24.700
But having a famous family member that you can parade on your channel is definitely an advantage that Olivia made the most of,

08:24.700 --> 08:25.500
and it shows.

08:25.500 --> 08:30.500
In her first videos, the best performing content were the videos where she featured her mother.

08:30.500 --> 08:36.700
Out of the first set of uploads, these videos completely outshone all the other content in their performance,

08:36.700 --> 08:40.100
because they offered something that other creators really couldn't.

08:40.100 --> 08:41.500
Famous people. Wow!

08:41.500 --> 08:46.700
You know these days how many people will complain that YouTube has essentially become a platform

08:46.700 --> 08:53.700
that pushes already established celebrities over the wholesome grassroots content that anyone can support themselves with.

08:53.700 --> 08:57.700
Well, it was 2014 when Olivia Jade set her channel up.

08:57.700 --> 09:00.300
Is it not fair to ask what was different exactly?

09:00.300 --> 09:08.500
Well, to completely understand that, we have to ask ourselves about the problem that many people have with celebrities who are currently dominating the platform.

09:08.500 --> 09:14.500
In my opinion, the main problem that many people have with the current wave of creators is that philosophically speaking,

09:14.500 --> 09:22.100
YouTube has an organic appeal that means to a lot of the audiences the idea that there's a playing field in which everyone starts on zero.

09:22.100 --> 09:27.500
If someone joined YouTube and YouTube just gave them a million subscribers, people would be kind of pissed off.

09:27.500 --> 09:31.300
And although that's not exactly what happens when other celebrities enter the platform,

09:31.300 --> 09:36.500
it often feels like they bring such a reputation with them that it gives them an unfair advantage.

09:36.500 --> 09:44.300
Now this is not something that I'm exactly concerned about because I don't believe that many of these celebrities can really adapt to the truly authentic environment.

09:44.300 --> 09:51.100
I personally believe that there will always be an audience for creators who have constantly lived on the pedestal that stardom often brings.

09:51.100 --> 09:56.700
However, I understand why it frustrates people that YouTube throws its weight behind such content like it's the future.

09:56.700 --> 10:03.300
The thing about Olivia Jade is that she didn't piss people off because she hadn't established herself in any other industry at that point.

10:03.300 --> 10:09.100
And therefore, even if she had both an advantage and a gimmick in the fact that her mother was relatively famous,

10:09.100 --> 10:13.700
she hadn't established a reputation as a celebrity outside of the platform.

10:13.700 --> 10:21.500
Celebrities are relatively alienated from the general public and therefore have to develop a top-down relationship when they construct these YouTube channels.

10:21.500 --> 10:26.500
Whereas people like Olivia Jade were building relationships to the audience from the bottom up.

10:26.500 --> 10:31.500
And although she definitely had a privilege in that she was more than ready to spend for cheeky giveaways,

10:31.500 --> 10:37.900
she flew under the radar because many of these advantages were much more implicit and she wasn't known prior to the platform.

10:37.900 --> 10:44.500
I've been there and every other YouTuber that you watch and that's your favorite has also been there, I can almost guarantee it.

10:44.500 --> 10:49.300
No one starts out with a million subscribers, no one starts out with a hundred thousand, no one even starts out with ten subscribers.

10:49.300 --> 10:52.100
You start from zero. You have to work yourself up that way.

10:52.100 --> 10:59.500
So if it's something you're passionate about and something you actually like doing and you're not doing it to get famous or like whatever, become an influencer, make this your job.

10:59.500 --> 11:07.000
If you're actually doing it because you like doing it, I think you're gonna get really far and you just have to be persistent and tell yourself like,

11:07.000 --> 11:08.600
Okay, like I'm doing this because I like it.

11:08.600 --> 11:15.100
Yet those subtle advantages allowed her to establish herself as a well-off beauty blogger that was also your girl next door.

11:15.100 --> 11:24.300
A rather strange dynamic when you think about it, but one that works in these instances because we like people who we can relate to and even imagine ourselves in their position.

11:24.300 --> 11:30.100
She's a laid-back kind of girl who's doing well for herself but can bond with people using universal topics.

11:30.100 --> 11:35.300
That's the sort of balance you need for a protagonist and why someone like, for example, Bobby Misner doesn't work.

11:35.300 --> 11:39.500
People who make a big deal out of their privilege are not particularly well liked.

11:39.500 --> 11:43.500
At the end of the day, Olivia Jade is just a passive result of the system.

11:43.500 --> 11:48.600
At first, the only real appeal that she seemed to pertain was the fact that she was related to famous people.

11:48.600 --> 11:54.900
However, eventually the rest of her content began to perform well because the other key appeal that many people enjoy is the clout.

11:54.900 --> 12:03.200
There's a reason that people who otherwise have nothing really going for them like Lance Stewart managed to acquire millions of views beyond just the clickbait.

12:03.200 --> 12:11.600
When we watch vlogs, because they are a window into someone's life, once they gain some sort of momentum and fan base, it becomes appealing to want to interact with them,

12:11.600 --> 12:14.700
even if the content that they're pumping out is fairly mindless.

12:14.700 --> 12:21.000
With that said, I wouldn't say Olivia Jade's videos were anything particularly bad, and she did have some neat concepts that she played with.

12:21.000 --> 12:25.800
If I was going to prom and wanted a lovely dress, maybe her suggestions would be useful.

12:25.800 --> 12:29.800
A lot of her videos were fairly standard, but it's clear what her appeal is.

12:29.800 --> 12:38.800
It's the juxtaposition between someone who's famous, but at the same time down-to-earth and not above-us plebeians, giving us some insight about what it's like to live that life.

12:38.800 --> 12:42.300
It gives us the sort of impression that they are, just like us.

12:42.300 --> 12:51.400
She's just a girl with a bit more money, and she's doing with that money what you do with that money as well, and she wants to help you right down that road too, right?

12:52.400 --> 12:57.400
Mm-hmm. I think it's best we talk about the next spicy part.

13:00.800 --> 13:05.800
Most YouTube audiences don't hate people for the sake of being rich.

13:05.800 --> 13:10.800
Hell, in many instances, we welcome the diversity of the lifestyle that they can show to us.

13:10.800 --> 13:19.800
It can provide us with some pretty great entertainment, and if that can help provide some escapism from people's often depressing daily lives, then who the hell am I to talk it down?

13:19.800 --> 13:28.800
However, at the same time, we like to be under some perception that these guys are like us, have to answer to the same system as us, and play the same ballgame as us.

13:28.800 --> 13:37.800
And although this is seldom actually the case, it would cause far too much stress to the average viewer to be picking apart every subtle privilege that many of these creators might have access to.

13:37.800 --> 13:47.800
Equally, a creator in that position may be pretty ignorant to the political complexities that come with such discourse, and just want to entertain people, and that's also fair enough.

13:47.800 --> 13:55.800
At the end of the day, we want to see the circumstance as not necessarily defining the person, even if it does, of course, influence them.

13:55.800 --> 14:02.800
However, when these privileges are taken advantage of and do fall into the public eye, they cause a whirlwind of outrage,

14:02.800 --> 14:09.800
because this creator, who has sold themselves on the platform that this lovely, relatable person has their platform undermined,

14:09.800 --> 14:16.800
and today's situation is probably one of the worst examples of that. Let's indulge ourselves in the details then.

14:16.800 --> 14:21.800
So at around the start of March, we became aware that there was a transpiring incident occurring,

14:21.800 --> 14:25.800
with one of the people being involved our little vlog darling, Olivia Jade.

14:25.800 --> 14:35.800
As explained earlier, the headlines read that Olivia Jade had been involved in a bribery scheme that had gained her admission to the prestigious University of Southern California,

14:35.800 --> 14:38.800
and there was immediate backlash driven by very strong sentiments.

14:38.800 --> 14:43.800
This is all important, and we'll definitely discuss the justification of that in a bit,

14:43.800 --> 14:48.800
but for the moment, I want to actually lay down the details, because many of them have been filtered out by the media.

14:48.800 --> 14:54.800
The golden question that matters to me is how complicit or aware was Olivia Jade in all of this.

14:54.800 --> 14:58.800
To do that, we're pulling up the indictment documents and creating a timeline.

14:58.800 --> 15:06.800
For those who are interested, I'll be leaving a link to the document amongst the references as usual, in case you would like to see the full context.

15:06.800 --> 15:09.800
Olivia Jade's application begins around page 91.

15:09.800 --> 15:12.800
We're in July 2017 right now.

15:12.800 --> 15:18.800
Olivia Jade's sister had just been admitted to USC under similar bribery related pretenses,

15:18.800 --> 15:22.800
and the family were prepared to go through the same system of application again.

15:22.800 --> 15:29.800
The individual, named CW1 in this instance, is helping them create a fraudulent profile for their daughter,

15:29.800 --> 15:32.800
that will enable them to gain entry to the university.

15:32.800 --> 15:34.800
How are they going to do this?

15:34.800 --> 15:36.800
Well, they're going to fabricate rowing credentials.

15:36.800 --> 15:40.800
To do this, they need to send every single detail possible to make it look valid,

15:40.800 --> 15:43.800
and this is where a very important element comes in,

15:43.800 --> 15:48.800
because one of those details was a photo of Olivia Jade at an ergometer,

15:48.800 --> 15:53.800
which can mean a few things, but in this instance, it is typically referring to an indoor rowing machine.

15:53.800 --> 15:59.800
It seems that Olivia must have had some conscious knowledge that something, something may have been going on.

15:59.800 --> 16:06.800
In some cases, children were excused as ignorant due to the fact that they may have been doing it under the pretense of a photoshoot,

16:06.800 --> 16:12.800
and this is not an impossible defense here, but it's certainly something that Olivia would need to probably provide an explanation of

16:12.800 --> 16:15.800
if she wanted to gain the empathy of her audience.

16:15.800 --> 16:18.800
So she was approved through the subcommittee in November,

16:18.800 --> 16:23.800
and there was a congratulatory email, and money was transferred, all fairly routine.

16:23.800 --> 16:27.800
However, the testimony does contain another very curious detail.

16:27.800 --> 16:32.800
The informant in this instance, CW1, claims that a guidance counselor at the high school

16:32.800 --> 16:37.800
confronted Olivia about her and her sister's credentials for their application,

16:37.800 --> 16:40.800
as they did not believe they were legitimate.

16:40.800 --> 16:45.800
What was said in that conversation, we cannot be certain, but if true, it is fairly incriminating.

16:45.800 --> 16:51.800
This is just a testimony. However, what makes for even more compelling evidence further to this,

16:51.800 --> 16:57.800
is that in November, the mother, Laurie, cc'd their younger daughter, Olivia Jade,

16:57.800 --> 17:01.800
in an email to the informant, requesting help to complete the application,

17:01.800 --> 17:06.800
without the attention of their quote, little friend at the high school.

17:06.800 --> 17:12.800
This was subsequently resolved in a following email, stating that USC was surprised to hear that there was a concern.

17:12.800 --> 17:16.800
This is complemented with another voicemail from one of the participants in the scheme,

17:16.800 --> 17:22.800
Donna Hanel, the now former athletic director, to try and make sure the scheme wasn't found out.

17:22.800 --> 17:24.800
So this is all going on right now.

17:24.800 --> 17:27.800
The parents' participation was exposed through a sting operation,

17:27.800 --> 17:32.800
the documented calls in which the parents make fairly candid admissions of their involvement.

17:32.800 --> 17:37.800
The girls themselves aren't directly involved in these calls, but with everything considered,

17:37.800 --> 17:41.800
it makes it hard to deny that there must be some awareness from Olivia Jade,

17:41.800 --> 17:47.800
unless she really did not ask any questions, or make any assumptions at all.

17:47.800 --> 17:53.800
But I doubt many people would buy that, in spite of the responses that she has made disassociating herself.

17:53.800 --> 17:59.800
The whole situation has soured the perception towards her, and placed some statements in a new light.

17:59.800 --> 18:06.800
But I do want the experience of like, game days, partying, I don't really care about school, as you guys all know.

18:06.800 --> 18:09.800
Now normally, this would not be a big deal.

18:09.800 --> 18:13.800
There are a lot of people who go to university without a great work ethic,

18:13.800 --> 18:20.800
and in a way, if you were a popular YouTuber, maybe you would just want to get through and have a good time while you're at it.

18:20.800 --> 18:24.800
But the thing is, this is not just an incredibly prestigious university,

18:24.800 --> 18:30.800
but Jade also entered on the basis of athletic exceptionalism, something that would take immense effort,

18:30.800 --> 18:34.800
and many of those admissions are typically done on a selective basis,

18:34.800 --> 18:38.800
and if they obtained it, it is very possible that someone else was likely denied it,

18:38.800 --> 18:42.800
someone else who firstly deserved it more, and probably needed it more as well.

18:42.800 --> 18:46.800
Equally, it does compromise Olivia Jade's rhetoric at other points.

18:46.800 --> 18:53.800
He's honestly really helpful, I can just look at that for inspiration, I guess, and seeing that hard work does pay off.

18:53.800 --> 18:57.800
He didn't come from a lot, so it's cool to see that he built it all himself.

18:57.800 --> 19:01.800
She's just ruined whatever perception people previously had of her.

19:01.800 --> 19:08.800
If she was going for the party girl who wants to have a good time, then she shouldn't be cheating the system trying to portray herself as anything else,

19:08.800 --> 19:13.800
and if she was going for the girl who's always on the grind, then she shouldn't be partaking in an elitist scheme

19:13.800 --> 19:17.800
that is for people who are basically too lazy, too lazy or too unskilled,

19:17.800 --> 19:23.800
and completely benefits off the back of the parent income, and none of her actual own work whatsoever.

19:23.800 --> 19:27.800
And that's what is the worst about this situation, it is the pinnacle of laziness,

19:27.800 --> 19:32.800
and I want to take this forward prior to providing some personal thoughts on the situation.

19:32.800 --> 19:38.800
This is an issue that resonates with me a lot, because I applied for a very prestigious university,

19:38.800 --> 19:43.800
and I made it through to the final interview stage before being rejected.

19:43.800 --> 19:47.800
Given how hard I worked for it, and given how many hurdles I had faced,

19:47.800 --> 19:52.800
not just to do with the application, but due to all the complications, real life interference, and so on,

19:52.800 --> 19:59.800
it made me so bitter when they rejected me, and it made me even more bitter when I found out who had been accepted,

19:59.800 --> 20:04.800
because it didn't make sense to me, and as the following year turned to be one of the worst years in my life,

20:04.800 --> 20:09.800
I continuously linked it back to that stage and re-ran every single thing.

20:09.800 --> 20:14.800
What went wrong? What could I have done better? Did I even do anything wrong? Was the system corrupt?

20:14.800 --> 20:19.800
When this situation arose, it did not surprise me, because when you have people who know people,

20:19.800 --> 20:25.800
and various other positions of power, it's very easily corrupted, because people want the best for their family,

20:25.800 --> 20:30.800
often to the point where they're willing to pull a few strings, and when you're aware of the strings being pulled,

20:30.800 --> 20:34.800
you want to pull them too, and then it becomes a string pulling contest,

20:34.800 --> 20:38.800
and the only people who lose are the people who don't have the ability to pull the strings,

20:38.800 --> 20:45.800
the people who don't have that privilege, many people who look towards you in the first place for that guidance.

20:45.800 --> 20:50.800
There have been reports saying that it's unclear if Olivia Jade knew or not about the scheme.

20:50.800 --> 20:57.800
To me, it's a bit clearer. It seems to me that Olivia Jade would have to have been extremely ignorant and unassuming,

20:57.800 --> 21:03.800
if she didn't at least have some knowledge of this, and she's going to have to respond to a lot of the details

21:03.800 --> 21:06.800
if she wants to gain back the fans that she's lost.

21:06.800 --> 21:12.800
It seems incredible to me that she has a YouTube following, her own brand, successful parents,

21:12.800 --> 21:17.800
and still, they wanted her to have more. With this in mind, it's very difficult for me to have sympathy,

21:17.800 --> 21:24.800
because it was not an action justified by desperation at no other option, it was an action justified by greed.

21:24.800 --> 21:30.800
And of course, her parents are definitely the greatest influencers in this, but when she's the prime beneficiary of the scheme,

21:30.800 --> 21:34.800
she can't be surprised to have some responsibility at her doorstep.

21:34.800 --> 21:40.800
She obviously doesn't deserve the cruel comments and so on, but I don't think it's fair for outlets to scope in on that,

21:40.800 --> 21:43.800
as if it encompasses the situation or the criticism.

21:43.800 --> 21:48.800
Most comments typically encompass a very snarky attitude to a lack of growing qualification,

21:48.800 --> 21:52.800
and I'm one to have commented in the past when I think outrage can go too far,

21:52.800 --> 21:57.800
but this is the stuff that many people have a personal connection with, because many of us have gone through the system,

21:57.800 --> 21:59.800
and we want it to be fair.

21:59.800 --> 22:05.800
It's a real shame we live in a world where many people will feel completely defined by the university they attend,

22:05.800 --> 22:08.800
to the point that some are willing to play dirty just to get into them.

22:08.800 --> 22:10.800
And it's not like I don't understand.

22:10.800 --> 22:16.800
You look at many of the top performing people in certain areas, and many of them have attended the same circle of institutes,

22:16.800 --> 22:19.800
but they are in that position for a reason, and you are not.

22:19.800 --> 22:21.800
As for the parents, well...

22:21.800 --> 22:24.800
Yeah, I did some really shady s*** when I was younger.

22:24.800 --> 22:29.800
I don't know how I didn't get caught for it. I... lucky I'm alive and breathing.

22:29.800 --> 22:35.800
Really, the only thing was for me was like about safety, like don't Uber by yourself, don't dah dah dah dah, like be classy,

22:35.800 --> 22:38.800
you only get one reputation, like that whole sort of thing.

22:38.800 --> 22:42.800
The mother in this instance started as the source of her daughter's success,

22:42.800 --> 22:47.800
and ultimately was the source of this conflict that has caused the hiatus and damage to the channel.

22:47.800 --> 22:51.800
And unfortunately, it's not like people are going to want to see her back on the channel.

22:51.800 --> 22:54.800
Maybe for a quick jail cell interview, that might pull views.

22:54.800 --> 22:56.800
But it wouldn't create prolonging credibility.

22:56.800 --> 23:01.800
The parents tried to give the children an advantage, but now have actually impacted their chances,

23:01.800 --> 23:03.800
because they're going to live with that stigma.

23:03.800 --> 23:07.800
Especially Olivia Jade, as someone who is well known to many people.

23:07.800 --> 23:10.800
Whether that's deserved or not, it's a legacy that will sting.

23:10.800 --> 23:16.800
Olivia Jade is probably just a person who's used to receiving good things without asking questions,

23:16.800 --> 23:19.800
and she thought she'd not ask questions and take what she can get.

23:19.800 --> 23:23.800
However, as many of us have found, that is seldom the best route to take.

23:23.800 --> 23:26.800
Olivia Jade is not just a public figure, but she's a YouTube figure.

23:26.800 --> 23:28.800
She's not the same as your typical celebrity.

23:28.800 --> 23:32.800
She has that close relationship, people look towards her for guidance.

23:32.800 --> 23:35.800
We idolise these people, whether they want that or not.

23:35.800 --> 23:38.800
These are clearly private matters in many ways,

23:38.800 --> 23:41.800
however they spill over onto her public reputation,

23:41.800 --> 23:46.800
as they compromise what she claimed to have stood for, and what many people saw her as.

23:46.800 --> 23:49.800
When we see a public figure embroiled in these controversies,

23:49.800 --> 23:53.800
although I don't think it should necessarily spell the end of their career,

23:53.800 --> 23:55.800
because people can learn and grow,

23:55.800 --> 24:00.800
it might be worth taking a few months away from YouTube to focus on the education side of things.

24:00.800 --> 24:03.800
I personally think that she should withdraw from the university,

24:03.800 --> 24:05.800
and she should rerun the application system,

24:05.800 --> 24:10.800
because it's clear there need to be more repercussions for people who might consider this scheme in the future.

24:10.800 --> 24:13.800
We shouldn't merely be at ease that this has been found out,

24:13.800 --> 24:15.800
because it's likely just a fraction of it.

24:15.800 --> 24:18.800
There is probably many more schemes going on.

24:18.800 --> 24:20.800
I mean, it was reported at the time this transpired,

24:20.800 --> 24:26.800
Olivia Jade was on the USC's Chairman of the Board of Trustees $100 million yacht.

24:26.800 --> 24:31.800
Now, besides the question of how someone can spend $100 million on a bloody yacht,

24:31.800 --> 24:34.800
it should really be a red flag that these elite links lie deep.

24:34.800 --> 24:39.800
On top of this, the fact that Olivia Jade has now been proven to be at the university under false pretenses,

24:39.800 --> 24:41.800
and given all the media attention,

24:41.800 --> 24:46.800
it might be genuinely beneficial for her to drop out and actually demonstrate some self-sufficiency.

24:46.800 --> 24:49.800
She's going to be alright regardless of the situation.

24:49.800 --> 24:53.800
Her parents are clearly successful, and it may be somewhat validating for herself,

24:53.800 --> 24:56.800
rather than having this reputation hang over her.

24:56.800 --> 25:00.800
However, by the looks of it, the university will be keeping her in attendance,

25:00.800 --> 25:02.800
so that will be down to her own decision,

25:02.800 --> 25:05.800
and it will be down to other people to judge it on their own basis.

25:05.800 --> 25:08.800
If she does choose to stay, and if she's allowed to stay,

25:08.800 --> 25:13.800
I'd recommend working a bit harder, because you may well be standing in someone else's place.

25:13.800 --> 25:18.800
I'm sure many people watching this video today have cheated in a test at some point in their life,

25:18.800 --> 25:21.800
but the difference is, that's something that anyone can do,

25:21.800 --> 25:26.800
and most people do on a much smaller scale, with a much lesser effect.

25:26.800 --> 25:29.800
I said this at the start of the video, people have privileges.

25:29.800 --> 25:33.800
Some are obtained within society's bounds that we can look past to her position,

25:33.800 --> 25:35.800
due to her status as an entertainer,

25:35.800 --> 25:40.800
but Olivia Jade benefited from a privilege that took advantage of the system,

25:40.800 --> 25:45.800
and therefore, her chill, laid-back persona no longer seemed like it was just your rich girl

25:45.800 --> 25:48.800
doing what anyone else would do, while still getting that bread.

25:48.800 --> 25:53.800
It felt like it was a girl who didn't have to do anything, because her position was too secure.

25:53.800 --> 25:58.800
Even if it's not on camera, we want to know that people are gonna go through the same system as us.

25:58.800 --> 26:01.800
We would like the world to be balanced. It's not.

26:01.800 --> 26:07.800
When people who preach it to their followers are showed to not stand by those principles themselves, it annoys us.

26:07.800 --> 26:10.800
This isn't just a bad decision, this isn't just hypocritical,

26:10.800 --> 26:14.800
this has been a long played-out scenario which was calculated and conducted.

26:14.800 --> 26:18.800
It is bad. Olivia Jade has so much of her life ahead of her.

26:18.800 --> 26:21.800
I take this as a serious learning experience,

26:21.800 --> 26:27.800
and recommend getting in touch with the hard work that people actually do to get a position at the university,

26:27.800 --> 26:31.800
because this seems like it's either an outcome of being seriously out of touch,

26:31.800 --> 26:34.800
or lacking empathy for others who work far too hard.

26:34.800 --> 26:37.800
That's sometimes what having copious amounts of money,

26:37.800 --> 26:42.800
a fanbase who seldom challenge you, and parents who will go too far for your protection will foster,

26:42.800 --> 26:48.800
and it's definitely something we should discuss if we want to create a world of people that actually look out for each other.

26:48.800 --> 26:51.800
It sounds corny, but it's true, and it's what I believe in.

26:51.800 --> 26:55.800
I hope she sorts herself out and manages to respond to some of the points discussed today,

26:55.800 --> 27:02.800
because after this investigation, it does seem like what she established herself as is somewhat compromised,

27:02.800 --> 27:06.800
and a lot of the upset from people who admired her is kinda justified.

27:06.800 --> 27:09.800
I don't think her YouTube channel is an industry plant,

27:09.800 --> 27:13.800
and it doesn't seem like she's just another celebrity trying to be relatable.

27:13.800 --> 27:16.800
It seems like she does genuinely care about the videos she makes,

27:16.800 --> 27:20.800
but she's certainly alienated a lot of her audience through this scheme,

27:20.800 --> 27:25.800
because otherwise, we wouldn't picture her as the sort of person to be involved in that sort of stuff.

27:25.800 --> 27:27.800
The sponsors will come back, the money will come back,

27:27.800 --> 27:30.800
but I think it will be down to her to bring the integrity back,

27:30.800 --> 27:33.800
and I think personally, that's the honourable thing to do.

27:33.800 --> 27:38.800
Oh, and one more thing before I finish. Bribery is bad. Thank you.

27:42.800 --> 27:45.800
So, that's the video. Hope you guys enjoyed.

27:45.800 --> 27:48.800
Would love to hear your thoughts on the situation in the comments section below.

27:48.800 --> 27:53.800
Really interesting one, and I hope that I've covered it in a bit more detail than some other people have.

27:53.800 --> 27:55.800
I would like to give a big shoutout to the editors.

27:55.800 --> 28:01.800
They have once again done a stellar, stellar, stellar, stellar, stellar, stellar, stellar, stellar, stellar job,

28:01.800 --> 28:03.800
and I'm gonna link them in the pinned comment.

28:03.800 --> 28:08.800
Go and check their channels out, or whatever links they put there, and send them some love.

28:08.800 --> 28:11.800
They've done a fantastic job. Fantastic job.

28:11.800 --> 28:15.800
Secondly, I wanna give big thanks to the Patreons, who've been very generous, as always.

28:15.800 --> 28:20.800
Need to give personal thanks to Evening Steel, who's on $50.

28:20.800 --> 28:25.800
Connor, who's also on $50, and Sumhala Baloo, who's also on $50.

28:25.800 --> 28:30.800
And on $100 is Brandon again. What a mad lad.

28:30.800 --> 28:34.800
You are truly a legend, and I appreciate you a lot. Thank you.

28:34.800 --> 28:40.800
If you wanna just chat with me, you can hit me up on Twitter, at The Right Opinion, on Facebook, on Discord.

28:40.800 --> 28:43.800
I do my best to be responsive there, too.

28:43.800 --> 28:48.800
I don't really have too much else to say today, so I just hope you're having a fantastic week, whatever day this goes up.

28:48.800 --> 28:52.800
I love you lots, and I appreciate you guys a lot. I will see you in the next one.

28:55.800 --> 29:13.800
Thanks for watching!
