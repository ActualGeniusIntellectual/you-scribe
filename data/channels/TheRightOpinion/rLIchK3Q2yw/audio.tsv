0	8360	Hello ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the right opinion, the home of a twat with
8360	12480	too much free time, and today we talk about the madness that is Black Friday, well it
12480	16120	is in the US at least, in which people have been trampled, injured, and in some cases
16120	18440	shot because of the intensity of the event.
18440	22420	On face value it would be easy for me to rant about how this is representative of the worst
22420	25320	of humanity, and to an extent, it is.
25320	28440	But I'm gonna be defending Black Friday and I'm not sure why, but as I script I'm sure
28440	30680	the reasons will come to mind eventually.
30680	34280	Okay so this is how I view it, Black Friday is a good day for buying stuff that you'd
34280	37840	buy anyway, that's my perspective, and that's how I've always dealt with it.
37840	41760	I purchased an Xbox One a couple years back, for some damn reason, but I got it at a good
41760	45820	price and not one that I would have attained at any other time that year, and I was looking
45820	47160	to buy one at the time.
47160	50860	And yes, the primitive drive that it brings out in certain people is rather disgusting,
50860	54600	but this is a symptom of consumerism that has been pushed, a mentality that I've always
54600	59040	been against personally, but one that is unfortunately unstoppable in modern society.
59040	63560	Okay you say, but I criticised Apple when they exploited their consumerism very strongly,
63560	64560	and that is true.
64560	67680	But in the instance of the new iPhone, the only thing that their consumerism included
67680	70360	was basically hiking prices ridiculously.
70360	74160	The only winners from that situation that Apple presented were Apple themselves.
74160	78560	In the instances of Black Friday and Cyber Monday, you can actually win, because instead
78560	82280	of hiking prices, they're cutting prices, and although there are many idiots out there
82280	85920	who will buy a shit ton of stuff and then quickly regret it, you can actually buy certain
85920	88720	devices for better than standard expenditure.
88720	91000	Black Friday is an exercise in natural selection.
91000	94720	Those who know when to spend their money and how to spend their money survive and do well
94720	97160	out of it, even though there are exceptions.
97160	101120	With the thought of those exceptions, I'm going to pass over to the grumpy whelk to
101120	104880	demonstrate the correct utilisation of Black Friday.
104880	111560	Greetings, I am the grumpy whelk, so named because of my grumpiness and resemblance to
111560	113800	everyone's favourite boucan day.
113800	116240	No, that's not a category on Pornhub.
116240	120920	Today, I'm here to educate you about how to do Black Friday right.
120920	125280	It may surprise you to note that this is not another day where us oppressive white folk
125280	130000	direct our efforts to our darker-skinned compadres as penance for years of injustice.
130000	134960	No, in fact, Black Friday is for bargains, bargains, bargains.
134960	140080	It's a day for joy and celebration, and the purchasing of items for which you have no
140080	142040	godly purpose possessing.
142040	147200	I myself picked up a bow tie and a delightful pair of espadrilles.
147200	151740	Now tighten your bumpkins and follow these six easy steps, and maybe you can do Black
151740	152740	Friday right.
152740	158040	So you want a new jacket with tweed elbows or a new wife?
158040	159920	This is how you make it happen.
159920	162180	Step one, location.
162180	167080	Now you have two options, don't you brave the mad rush of consumerism and venture forth
167080	173320	to the march√© knowing the shop and item you wish to purchase, or do you peruse the interweb
173320	176320	using buzzwords to locate the best deals?
176320	178000	Take your time with this decision.
178000	182480	It really is location, location, location, but don't take too long.
182480	187000	Before you know it, Cyber Monday will have passed and you will be groveling to your mother
187000	193620	scraping two cents together to make a third, and besides, who goes out to shops anymore?
193620	196660	Step two, knowing the dangers.
196660	203340	Ensure you remain zen, there's no use engaging in a bout of fisticuffs over a half-off blender.
203340	208020	The only fighting you should be doing is with your wife when she burns the quiche.
208020	211120	Step three, put the kettle on.
211120	215340	These bargains are thirsty business, and what's a good deal without a good brew?
215340	220300	Besides, your sister just bought that new kettle on the eBay's after following these
220300	221860	six simple steps.
222220	224220	Link in the description.
224220	226820	Step four, purchase the item.
226820	231820	So now you've added the item or items to your basket, ensure the quantity is correct.
231820	236380	After all, who needs two chrome-plated dildos, aside from me of course.
236380	238700	Select checkout from the drop-down menu.
238700	243620	By now we've established none of you leave your house to shop, and if you do, well, aren't
243620	244620	you silly?
244620	249420	Input your card details ensuring there are no cat burglars or rapists looking over your
249420	254780	shoulder, and use your neighbour's address so that the MI5 or FBI remain in the dark
254780	258100	as to where you hang your jockstrap of an evening.
258100	263140	Be sure to select first-class delivery, you're not a peasant, and patiently wait with a good
263140	268980	Chaucer novel by the fire sipping your gin and vermouth as DPD do their thing.
268980	272460	Step five, enjoy.
272460	274180	Step six, profit.
274180	278780	Upon realising the item you purchased only seems desirable when discounted, like a shag
278780	284780	with a lowbrow hooker, wait for the market to come and sell your discounted item for profit.
284780	287820	Well, my work here is done.
287820	290700	Ta-ta, kids, and happy shopping.
290700	293100	Back to you, discount colossal.
293100	294620	Thank you, grumpy twat.
294620	298620	I appeared in a video with vanilla rice where I spoke about Patreon, and I said in it that
298620	302060	the responsibility lies with the person paying the money, and as long as they have received
302060	303820	what they pay for, then all is well.
303820	307820	That is the same with Black Friday, it's just a tactical cut in the prices that leaves the
307820	310060	individual to decide where to invest their money.
310060	314780	It's not anyone's job to nanny it and dictate people how to spend it, and if I can save
314780	318380	money on it, and you can save money on it, then I have no reason to complain.
318380	322020	Also, I've only mentioned it once, but my opinion on Cyber Monday is much alike.
322020	325820	I guess I like opportunities to save money, considering I barely spend any money anyway
325820	329820	because I'm a stingy twat, but it's nonetheless a great initiative in my opinion.
329820	333300	Big thanks to a grumpy cunt for featuring in my video, and his channel's going to be
333300	337500	up and running soon, hopefully, so go and sub to him in anticipation of the great content
337500	341460	that he will be pushing out, as my channel would not be anywhere without him.
341460	344640	Also would like to thank everyone, whenever you came across my channel, for helping me
344640	348080	to reach 500 subscribers, it wouldn't have been possible otherwise.
348080	351980	Also to Vanilla Rice, Jack Rami, and anyone else who has assisted my progress, it really
351980	352980	does mean a lot.
352980	357100	Anyway, I'll try and do something for 500, although I can't guarantee anything too soon,
357100	359700	as I've already put other videos on the conveyor belt first.
359700	362500	I'm The Right Opinion, and here's to 500 lads.
