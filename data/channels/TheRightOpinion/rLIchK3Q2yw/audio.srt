00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,360
Hello ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the right opinion, the home of a twat with

2
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:12,480
too much free time, and today we talk about the madness that is Black Friday, well it

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,120
is in the US at least, in which people have been trampled, injured, and in some cases

4
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,440
shot because of the intensity of the event.

5
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:22,420
On face value it would be easy for me to rant about how this is representative of the worst

6
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:25,320
of humanity, and to an extent, it is.

7
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,440
But I'm gonna be defending Black Friday and I'm not sure why, but as I script I'm sure

8
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,680
the reasons will come to mind eventually.

9
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:34,280
Okay so this is how I view it, Black Friday is a good day for buying stuff that you'd

10
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:37,840
buy anyway, that's my perspective, and that's how I've always dealt with it.

11
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,760
I purchased an Xbox One a couple years back, for some damn reason, but I got it at a good

12
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,820
price and not one that I would have attained at any other time that year, and I was looking

13
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,160
to buy one at the time.

14
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,860
And yes, the primitive drive that it brings out in certain people is rather disgusting,

15
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:54,600
but this is a symptom of consumerism that has been pushed, a mentality that I've always

16
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:59,040
been against personally, but one that is unfortunately unstoppable in modern society.

17
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:03,560
Okay you say, but I criticised Apple when they exploited their consumerism very strongly,

18
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,560
and that is true.

19
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,680
But in the instance of the new iPhone, the only thing that their consumerism included

20
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,360
was basically hiking prices ridiculously.

21
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:14,160
The only winners from that situation that Apple presented were Apple themselves.

22
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:18,560
In the instances of Black Friday and Cyber Monday, you can actually win, because instead

23
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,280
of hiking prices, they're cutting prices, and although there are many idiots out there

24
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:25,920
who will buy a shit ton of stuff and then quickly regret it, you can actually buy certain

25
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,720
devices for better than standard expenditure.

26
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,000
Black Friday is an exercise in natural selection.

27
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,720
Those who know when to spend their money and how to spend their money survive and do well

28
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,160
out of it, even though there are exceptions.

29
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:41,120
With the thought of those exceptions, I'm going to pass over to the grumpy whelk to

30
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,880
demonstrate the correct utilisation of Black Friday.

31
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:51,560
Greetings, I am the grumpy whelk, so named because of my grumpiness and resemblance to

32
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,800
everyone's favourite boucan day.

33
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,240
No, that's not a category on Pornhub.

34
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,920
Today, I'm here to educate you about how to do Black Friday right.

35
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:05,280
It may surprise you to note that this is not another day where us oppressive white folk

36
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,000
direct our efforts to our darker-skinned compadres as penance for years of injustice.

37
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,960
No, in fact, Black Friday is for bargains, bargains, bargains.

38
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:20,080
It's a day for joy and celebration, and the purchasing of items for which you have no

39
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,040
godly purpose possessing.

40
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:27,200
I myself picked up a bow tie and a delightful pair of espadrilles.

41
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,740
Now tighten your bumpkins and follow these six easy steps, and maybe you can do Black

42
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:32,740
Friday right.

43
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:38,040
So you want a new jacket with tweed elbows or a new wife?

44
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,920
This is how you make it happen.

45
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,180
Step one, location.

46
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:47,080
Now you have two options, don't you brave the mad rush of consumerism and venture forth

47
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:53,320
to the marchÃ© knowing the shop and item you wish to purchase, or do you peruse the interweb

48
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:56,320
using buzzwords to locate the best deals?

49
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,000
Take your time with this decision.

50
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,480
It really is location, location, location, but don't take too long.

51
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:07,000
Before you know it, Cyber Monday will have passed and you will be groveling to your mother

52
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,620
scraping two cents together to make a third, and besides, who goes out to shops anymore?

53
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:16,660
Step two, knowing the dangers.

54
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:23,340
Ensure you remain zen, there's no use engaging in a bout of fisticuffs over a half-off blender.

55
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:28,020
The only fighting you should be doing is with your wife when she burns the quiche.

56
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:31,120
Step three, put the kettle on.

57
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,340
These bargains are thirsty business, and what's a good deal without a good brew?

58
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:40,300
Besides, your sister just bought that new kettle on the eBay's after following these

59
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,860
six simple steps.

60
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:44,220
Link in the description.

61
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:46,820
Step four, purchase the item.

62
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:51,820
So now you've added the item or items to your basket, ensure the quantity is correct.

63
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:56,380
After all, who needs two chrome-plated dildos, aside from me of course.

64
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:58,700
Select checkout from the drop-down menu.

65
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:03,620
By now we've established none of you leave your house to shop, and if you do, well, aren't

66
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:04,620
you silly?

67
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:09,420
Input your card details ensuring there are no cat burglars or rapists looking over your

68
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:14,780
shoulder, and use your neighbour's address so that the MI5 or FBI remain in the dark

69
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:18,100
as to where you hang your jockstrap of an evening.

70
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:23,140
Be sure to select first-class delivery, you're not a peasant, and patiently wait with a good

71
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:28,980
Chaucer novel by the fire sipping your gin and vermouth as DPD do their thing.

72
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:32,460
Step five, enjoy.

73
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,180
Step six, profit.

74
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:38,780
Upon realising the item you purchased only seems desirable when discounted, like a shag

75
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:44,780
with a lowbrow hooker, wait for the market to come and sell your discounted item for profit.

76
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:47,820
Well, my work here is done.

77
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,700
Ta-ta, kids, and happy shopping.

78
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:53,100
Back to you, discount colossal.

79
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,620
Thank you, grumpy twat.

80
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:58,620
I appeared in a video with vanilla rice where I spoke about Patreon, and I said in it that

81
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:02,060
the responsibility lies with the person paying the money, and as long as they have received

82
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:03,820
what they pay for, then all is well.

83
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:07,820
That is the same with Black Friday, it's just a tactical cut in the prices that leaves the

84
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:10,060
individual to decide where to invest their money.

85
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:14,780
It's not anyone's job to nanny it and dictate people how to spend it, and if I can save

86
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:18,380
money on it, and you can save money on it, then I have no reason to complain.

87
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:22,020
Also, I've only mentioned it once, but my opinion on Cyber Monday is much alike.

88
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:25,820
I guess I like opportunities to save money, considering I barely spend any money anyway

89
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:29,820
because I'm a stingy twat, but it's nonetheless a great initiative in my opinion.

90
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:33,300
Big thanks to a grumpy cunt for featuring in my video, and his channel's going to be

91
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:37,500
up and running soon, hopefully, so go and sub to him in anticipation of the great content

92
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:41,460
that he will be pushing out, as my channel would not be anywhere without him.

93
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:44,640
Also would like to thank everyone, whenever you came across my channel, for helping me

94
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:48,080
to reach 500 subscribers, it wouldn't have been possible otherwise.

95
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,980
Also to Vanilla Rice, Jack Rami, and anyone else who has assisted my progress, it really

96
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:52,980
does mean a lot.

97
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:57,100
Anyway, I'll try and do something for 500, although I can't guarantee anything too soon,

98
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,700
as I've already put other videos on the conveyor belt first.

99
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:02,500
I'm The Right Opinion, and here's to 500 lads.
