Hello ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the right opinion, the home of a twat with

00:08.360 --> 00:12.480
too much free time, and today we talk about the madness that is Black Friday, well it

00:12.480 --> 00:16.120
is in the US at least, in which people have been trampled, injured, and in some cases

00:16.120 --> 00:18.440
shot because of the intensity of the event.

00:18.440 --> 00:22.420
On face value it would be easy for me to rant about how this is representative of the worst

00:22.420 --> 00:25.320
of humanity, and to an extent, it is.

00:25.320 --> 00:28.440
But I'm gonna be defending Black Friday and I'm not sure why, but as I script I'm sure

00:28.440 --> 00:30.680
the reasons will come to mind eventually.

00:30.680 --> 00:34.280
Okay so this is how I view it, Black Friday is a good day for buying stuff that you'd

00:34.280 --> 00:37.840
buy anyway, that's my perspective, and that's how I've always dealt with it.

00:37.840 --> 00:41.760
I purchased an Xbox One a couple years back, for some damn reason, but I got it at a good

00:41.760 --> 00:45.820
price and not one that I would have attained at any other time that year, and I was looking

00:45.820 --> 00:47.160
to buy one at the time.

00:47.160 --> 00:50.860
And yes, the primitive drive that it brings out in certain people is rather disgusting,

00:50.860 --> 00:54.600
but this is a symptom of consumerism that has been pushed, a mentality that I've always

00:54.600 --> 00:59.040
been against personally, but one that is unfortunately unstoppable in modern society.

00:59.040 --> 01:03.560
Okay you say, but I criticised Apple when they exploited their consumerism very strongly,

01:03.560 --> 01:04.560
and that is true.

01:04.560 --> 01:07.680
But in the instance of the new iPhone, the only thing that their consumerism included

01:07.680 --> 01:10.360
was basically hiking prices ridiculously.

01:10.360 --> 01:14.160
The only winners from that situation that Apple presented were Apple themselves.

01:14.160 --> 01:18.560
In the instances of Black Friday and Cyber Monday, you can actually win, because instead

01:18.560 --> 01:22.280
of hiking prices, they're cutting prices, and although there are many idiots out there

01:22.280 --> 01:25.920
who will buy a shit ton of stuff and then quickly regret it, you can actually buy certain

01:25.920 --> 01:28.720
devices for better than standard expenditure.

01:28.720 --> 01:31.000
Black Friday is an exercise in natural selection.

01:31.000 --> 01:34.720
Those who know when to spend their money and how to spend their money survive and do well

01:34.720 --> 01:37.160
out of it, even though there are exceptions.

01:37.160 --> 01:41.120
With the thought of those exceptions, I'm going to pass over to the grumpy whelk to

01:41.120 --> 01:44.880
demonstrate the correct utilisation of Black Friday.

01:44.880 --> 01:51.560
Greetings, I am the grumpy whelk, so named because of my grumpiness and resemblance to

01:51.560 --> 01:53.800
everyone's favourite boucan day.

01:53.800 --> 01:56.240
No, that's not a category on Pornhub.

01:56.240 --> 02:00.920
Today, I'm here to educate you about how to do Black Friday right.

02:00.920 --> 02:05.280
It may surprise you to note that this is not another day where us oppressive white folk

02:05.280 --> 02:10.000
direct our efforts to our darker-skinned compadres as penance for years of injustice.

02:10.000 --> 02:14.960
No, in fact, Black Friday is for bargains, bargains, bargains.

02:14.960 --> 02:20.080
It's a day for joy and celebration, and the purchasing of items for which you have no

02:20.080 --> 02:22.040
godly purpose possessing.

02:22.040 --> 02:27.200
I myself picked up a bow tie and a delightful pair of espadrilles.

02:27.200 --> 02:31.740
Now tighten your bumpkins and follow these six easy steps, and maybe you can do Black

02:31.740 --> 02:32.740
Friday right.

02:32.740 --> 02:38.040
So you want a new jacket with tweed elbows or a new wife?

02:38.040 --> 02:39.920
This is how you make it happen.

02:39.920 --> 02:42.180
Step one, location.

02:42.180 --> 02:47.080
Now you have two options, don't you brave the mad rush of consumerism and venture forth

02:47.080 --> 02:53.320
to the marchÃ© knowing the shop and item you wish to purchase, or do you peruse the interweb

02:53.320 --> 02:56.320
using buzzwords to locate the best deals?

02:56.320 --> 02:58.000
Take your time with this decision.

02:58.000 --> 03:02.480
It really is location, location, location, but don't take too long.

03:02.480 --> 03:07.000
Before you know it, Cyber Monday will have passed and you will be groveling to your mother

03:07.000 --> 03:13.620
scraping two cents together to make a third, and besides, who goes out to shops anymore?

03:13.620 --> 03:16.660
Step two, knowing the dangers.

03:16.660 --> 03:23.340
Ensure you remain zen, there's no use engaging in a bout of fisticuffs over a half-off blender.

03:23.340 --> 03:28.020
The only fighting you should be doing is with your wife when she burns the quiche.

03:28.020 --> 03:31.120
Step three, put the kettle on.

03:31.120 --> 03:35.340
These bargains are thirsty business, and what's a good deal without a good brew?

03:35.340 --> 03:40.300
Besides, your sister just bought that new kettle on the eBay's after following these

03:40.300 --> 03:41.860
six simple steps.

03:42.220 --> 03:44.220
Link in the description.

03:44.220 --> 03:46.820
Step four, purchase the item.

03:46.820 --> 03:51.820
So now you've added the item or items to your basket, ensure the quantity is correct.

03:51.820 --> 03:56.380
After all, who needs two chrome-plated dildos, aside from me of course.

03:56.380 --> 03:58.700
Select checkout from the drop-down menu.

03:58.700 --> 04:03.620
By now we've established none of you leave your house to shop, and if you do, well, aren't

04:03.620 --> 04:04.620
you silly?

04:04.620 --> 04:09.420
Input your card details ensuring there are no cat burglars or rapists looking over your

04:09.420 --> 04:14.780
shoulder, and use your neighbour's address so that the MI5 or FBI remain in the dark

04:14.780 --> 04:18.100
as to where you hang your jockstrap of an evening.

04:18.100 --> 04:23.140
Be sure to select first-class delivery, you're not a peasant, and patiently wait with a good

04:23.140 --> 04:28.980
Chaucer novel by the fire sipping your gin and vermouth as DPD do their thing.

04:28.980 --> 04:32.460
Step five, enjoy.

04:32.460 --> 04:34.180
Step six, profit.

04:34.180 --> 04:38.780
Upon realising the item you purchased only seems desirable when discounted, like a shag

04:38.780 --> 04:44.780
with a lowbrow hooker, wait for the market to come and sell your discounted item for profit.

04:44.780 --> 04:47.820
Well, my work here is done.

04:47.820 --> 04:50.700
Ta-ta, kids, and happy shopping.

04:50.700 --> 04:53.100
Back to you, discount colossal.

04:53.100 --> 04:54.620
Thank you, grumpy twat.

04:54.620 --> 04:58.620
I appeared in a video with vanilla rice where I spoke about Patreon, and I said in it that

04:58.620 --> 05:02.060
the responsibility lies with the person paying the money, and as long as they have received

05:02.060 --> 05:03.820
what they pay for, then all is well.

05:03.820 --> 05:07.820
That is the same with Black Friday, it's just a tactical cut in the prices that leaves the

05:07.820 --> 05:10.060
individual to decide where to invest their money.

05:10.060 --> 05:14.780
It's not anyone's job to nanny it and dictate people how to spend it, and if I can save

05:14.780 --> 05:18.380
money on it, and you can save money on it, then I have no reason to complain.

05:18.380 --> 05:22.020
Also, I've only mentioned it once, but my opinion on Cyber Monday is much alike.

05:22.020 --> 05:25.820
I guess I like opportunities to save money, considering I barely spend any money anyway

05:25.820 --> 05:29.820
because I'm a stingy twat, but it's nonetheless a great initiative in my opinion.

05:29.820 --> 05:33.300
Big thanks to a grumpy cunt for featuring in my video, and his channel's going to be

05:33.300 --> 05:37.500
up and running soon, hopefully, so go and sub to him in anticipation of the great content

05:37.500 --> 05:41.460
that he will be pushing out, as my channel would not be anywhere without him.

05:41.460 --> 05:44.640
Also would like to thank everyone, whenever you came across my channel, for helping me

05:44.640 --> 05:48.080
to reach 500 subscribers, it wouldn't have been possible otherwise.

05:48.080 --> 05:51.980
Also to Vanilla Rice, Jack Rami, and anyone else who has assisted my progress, it really

05:51.980 --> 05:52.980
does mean a lot.

05:52.980 --> 05:57.100
Anyway, I'll try and do something for 500, although I can't guarantee anything too soon,

05:57.100 --> 05:59.700
as I've already put other videos on the conveyor belt first.

05:59.700 --> 06:02.500
I'm The Right Opinion, and here's to 500 lads.
