0	10000	Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time.
10000	16000	And wow, do we have a great mess to cover today, because my my my, did it all not go down in the last few weeks.
16000	19000	And you know it's going to kick off when we have business to discuss.
19000	26000	And boy, do I love business, so you better grab your briefcases and suits and whatever you think you need to do to be in a business.
26000	31000	I don't know, maybe you're one of those progressive businesses and you get to wear jeans to work and do lines of coke.
31000	36000	Apologies, had a case of projection there. Anyhow, we were talking about business.
36000	41000	When we watch a YouTube channel, we enjoy their content, we are involved with them, we create a bond with them,
41000	44000	we don't tend to think about what goes on behind the scenes too much.
44000	51000	It's kinda strange to think that some of our favourite creators, as authentic as they may seem to us on screen, may just be well focused puppets.
51000	54000	But equally, being part of a business doesn't mean you're a puppet either.
54000	60000	Many relationships are forged on very mutual terms, and there are many benefits that come from business relationships.
60000	63000	But as viewers, either way, we don't really think about it.
63000	67000	We don't look for the exact ingredients for what creates the content we watch.
67000	73000	We just enjoy the recipe. Unless the recipe is for pineapple on pizza, then it's disgusting and you should never eat it, you cretins.
73000	79000	Anyways, back to the point, we don't speak about businesses like Defy Media because no one cares about them.
79000	81000	They're faceless corporations.
81000	88000	However, in many situations, they play a fundamental part in being the fabric of many of our favourite, most popular channels on the website.
88000	93000	One of those channels is Smosh, the channel founded by duo Ian Hecox and Anthony Padilla.
93000	96000	Now, there isn't too much to say about them otherwise.
96000	101000	They've been going on this platform for years now, and Smosh is a huge brand.
101000	105000	If you know YouTube, there is a high chance you know Smosh, even if it's just from the namesake.
105000	109000	Contrast that to Defy Media, well, they have less Twitter followers than me.
109000	111000	Irrelevant twats.
111000	117000	So it was only natural that many people's reaction when they heard the digital corporation Defy Media was shutting down was who?
117000	123000	Well, let me explain. Defy Media are firstly a multi-channel network, abbreviated to MCN,
123000	128000	and essentially that means they host creators for at least some financial cut of the channel's earnings.
128000	134000	So why on earth would you sign up to an MCN when all they're doing is reducing your profits?
134000	138000	Well, in the right environment, signing up to an MCN can really come with its perks.
138000	142000	If you're a creator who makes reviews, commentaries, and all sorts of content,
142000	147000	which often includes other people's material, you'll know how much of a nightmare the copyright system is.
147000	149000	Many networks claim to be able to alleviate that.
149000	152000	They have inside links to YouTube, and they will sort you out.
152000	154000	Another great example is monetisation.
154000	161000	We all know Susan Wojcicki struts around like Thanos, clicking her fingers and turning that green money tag to a yellow.
161000	166000	I know people who just give their network a buzz, and suddenly Susan's frosty grip has rescinded.
166000	170000	Praise those multi-channel networks for all the good charitable work they do.
170000	176000	They can also assist with sponsorships, finance, and merchandising, and pretty much anything to do with your channel.
176000	181000	Though, as we'll soon find, Defy Media definitely took a very hands-on approach.
181000	183000	And I'm not talking about Andy Signall.
183000	187000	Typically, the people who benefit most from the channel partnerships are large creators,
187000	193000	mainly because they can make the network more money, and thus they are seen as a more valuable financial asset.
193000	199000	Which is why, if you go on YouTube, search up networks like Freedom, and then look for rants on that network,
199000	203000	you'll find loads of angry, smaller YouTubers who felt completely neglected,
203000	207000	signed up under the premise that they would be offered something better than they actually received,
207000	210000	and then they were basically scammed out of 40% of their earnings.
210000	213000	That's not loose change if your videos blow up.
213000	216000	However, as a larger channel, typically you'll find more purpose,
216000	219000	and there are many benefits, which is probably why, like many networks,
219000	222000	Defy Media accumulated numerous clients who would seek their benefits.
222000	226000	On one hand, some of their relationships were merely normal partnerships,
226000	230000	where a creator would sign a contract and they would enter into a classic business association,
230000	232000	like most network creator contracts.
232000	236000	On the other hand, with Smosh, who will be one of the key topics today,
236000	242000	Ian and Anthony actually sold their channel to Defy Media, for the grand total of nothing.
242000	246000	Sold Smosh for zero dollars.
246000	251000	This essentially made Ian and Anthony employees of Defy Media, who then received a salary.
251000	255000	Now, an anonymous source told me that the salary that Ian and Anthony received
255000	259000	was actually rather small, especially when compared to the person who signed them.
259000	264000	That's just hearsay. But either way, these were the sorts of dynamics that Defy had with its creators.
264000	269000	It varied a lot. This meant that when this situation that we'll be discussing today transpired,
269000	273000	you had a load of differing accounts from multiple people, with none of them necessarily being false,
273000	277000	but each of them being different. However, each of these portraits can paint a picture of a company,
277000	280000	a brand, and channels that eventually succumb to a changing environment,
280000	284000	and one that there can definitely be cause for criticism, and perhaps a little more.
284000	288000	The thing about YouTube is that these things are always negotiated on an individual basis.
288000	291000	There isn't a level of wage equality when you sign a contract,
291000	294000	so everyone's experiences are gonna be different,
294000	298000	particularly when you suffer from the sort of business naivety like those we're going to discuss today.
298000	304000	In the wake of Defy Media's shutdown, a couple of its former creators, Chris Stutman and Smosh's Anthony Padilla,
304000	306000	came forward to voice their somewhat negative experiences.
306000	310000	Theirs will be the focus of today, along with other research outside of this sphere.
310000	314000	We'll be going the full mile to make sure there is no stone left unturned.
314000	319000	With light of this, creators like Shane Dawson have also been vocal in their criticism of Defy Media,
319000	323000	prompting many other creators to come forward with their individual experiences.
323000	325000	It's certainly interesting to read without a doubt.
325000	329000	It is clear from the lawyers who threatened Rylan Adams to the numerous unpaid creators,
329000	332000	that there was a significant lack of dignity in this business.
332000	335000	I've never been a fan of companies, so when all this occurred,
335000	341000	there was no possibility I was not going to use my platform to bash twats who I've never been fond of anyway.
341000	345000	And frankly, this definitely deserves a dissection dealt by the Doctor himself.
345000	348000	So today I'll be discussing Defy, Smosh, their relationship,
348000	352000	and many of the criticisms that can be wagered in the direction of the parties involved,
352000	355000	but equally harp on the ignorance of certain individuals,
355000	359000	and hopefully deal out some important life lessons for all of us to take forward.
359000	363000	I'll be using the story of Smosh to shape the narrative around Defy Media,
363000	365000	and then hone in on some key points.
365000	368000	Because the more of this is public, and the more people know about this,
368000	370000	the more people won't make the same mistakes.
370000	373000	As we'll soon find out, this is avoidable.
373000	376000	So, I suggest we dive straight in.
377000	382000	The original Smosh is the epitome of the YouTube dream.
382000	385000	Two creators, with nothing but an idea and a camera,
385000	388000	being able to chase something that in a way seems so impossible.
388000	392000	That's what I've always liked about YouTube, it's the ideal market in many ways.
392000	396000	Sure, there are certain setbacks that some people will always face when trying to access the market,
396000	401000	and there are still outside factors that make some people more likely to excel on the platform than others.
401000	407000	However, as a standalone platform, it is accessible to a diverse range of individuals looking to express themselves,
407000	414000	and it was through those early days of YouTube that Smosh really established themselves with a name that would inevitably last forever.
414000	418000	A bunch of punks screwing around in their dormitory or whatever room they could find,
418000	420000	and just running that sort of humour.
420000	423000	It was scrappy, it was messy, but it was organic.
423000	425000	And I guess that's what people liked.
425000	428000	Back then, YouTube didn't have to be a substitute for anything like TV,
428000	433000	like many allege it is trying to be now, because you go home, you check out a three minute video that someone uploaded,
433000	437000	and then you go and continue existing, maybe do some homework if you're a kid,
437000	440000	maybe watch the TV and cry about existence if you're an adult.
440000	445000	Either way, back then, there was no huge incentive to do anything particularly revolutionary with their content.
445000	449000	However, as said in the past, the platform became more competitive,
449000	451000	but Smosh did actually have a knack of keeping up.
451000	456000	They improved, and this was not just relative for the site, this was relative to their channel.
456000	460000	You could see the progression in quality, this is something that they had clearly invested in,
460000	466000	they were setting themselves up to be huge, as Defy Media or Alloy Digital soon noticed.
466000	470000	However, they were human beings, they had a knack for the comedy that captured the moment,
470000	474000	and they're clearly incredibly talented to have accumulated such an audience,
474000	478000	many of whom are around to this day, but they weren't business masterminds.
478000	481000	In 2018, YouTube is much more business oriented.
481000	486000	You can see that through someone like Jake Paul, and how ruthless, how ruthless his marketing is.
486000	490000	That was never the case for Smosh, they never had that huge financial interest,
490000	496000	but equally, this was what made them rather monetarily naive, which is where Defy Media entered the picture.
496000	500000	Now, I do not know the exact details of what happened in the negotiation stage.
500000	508000	I've heard things, as said, I can't confirm, it sounds pretty unfair on Smosh's side, but there's no necessary proof.
508000	514000	But through articles and Anthony's video, we can calculate that Defy Media, at that point named Alloy Digital,
514000	519000	prior to their merging with Break Media, obtained Smosh, with Ian and Anthony's consent,
519000	523000	in approximately July 2011, for the grand total of nothing.
523000	529000	Now, this isn't entirely accurate, as Anthony and Ian both received stock in the company in return.
529000	534000	However, this came with a catch, a pretty fucking significant catch, as any entrepreneur will tell you,
534000	537000	stock ain't worth jack shit if you don't go public.
537000	543000	And unfortunately for Anthony and Ian, you can see exactly why they feel a little mugged off,
543000	547000	they were taken advantage of, and that's because Ian and Anthony are just guys.
547000	551000	Jake Paul probably would have had five lawyers around the table to pick apart the contract word for word,
551000	556000	but this is 2011, some of the leading creators were just people who found themselves in that position,
556000	561000	rather than many of the manufactured public figures of today, they were normal people, in an exceptional position,
561000	565000	and a huge organisation comes forward and says they can do all these things for you,
565000	570000	and they'll give you a tonne of resources in the process, and probably a whole team, like they have now,
570000	572000	like this ownership would.
572000	577000	Who wouldn't want to take you up on that offer? Well, Harley Morenstein of Epic Meal Time wouldn't,
577000	584000	he disclosed to me that Alloy Digital also approached him, this time offering him $3 million on top of the proposed stock.
584000	588000	But in their meeting, the person who Morenstein regarded as the top dog,
588000	591000	posed the question of what Morenstein's channel actually did,
591000	597000	the sort of question you'd expect after responding to one of those stock emails of companies trying to sign your 4,000 subscriber channel.
597000	602000	You see, Defy or Alloy are a company, a business, trying to have a piece of the pie,
602000	605000	and once they have your channel, they're gonna get their money's worth.
605000	610000	Smosh were Ian and Anthony, you go around in 2011 and ask a Smosh fan who Smosh were,
610000	616000	and they'd say those two names, at that point, mostly making mere comedy videos on the internet.
616000	621000	Now, they weren't the most defined characters, but people knew them, no doubt about it.
621000	628000	But times change, and once Alloy had their hands on the business, they had a vision, a vision that changed entertainment.
628000	634000	But at what cost? To discuss that cost, I brought in my longtime friend and Smosh scholar, Pinely,
634000	641000	to lay out the influence of Defy, Alloy, or whatever they want to call themselves, on the beloved Ian and Anthony. Take it away.
641000	648000	Thanks babycakes. Hello, my name is Pinely the Box Boy, and as James mentioned earlier, I am in fact, a Smosh scholar.
648000	655000	For the past year, I've been sitting in my dark room, watching Smosh videos, studying every single frame. Mmm, yeah.
655000	662000	Not really, but I did make a video about them about a year ago. In the video, I brought out my problems with the, quote unquote, new Smosh.
662000	668000	I miss the old Smosh, a low blow fun Smosh, two people skit Smosh, good jokes and song Smosh.
668000	673000	I miss the old Smosh, four years ago, no, new Smosh, damn I miss the old Smosh.
673000	680000	Mainly focusing on the changes in their content. Now I was quite the genius, since I said almost exactly the same things Anthony brought up in his video,
680000	684000	only that I didn't know that Defy Media were the ones behind the problems in their content.
684000	689000	The last few months that I worked there, they started hiring new cast members.
689000	697000	The cast Anthony's talking about is the Smosh Crew, a group of ex-Viners and funny guys, Defy casted for Smosh a bit before Anthony left.
697000	704000	Now, do I want to be nice or nah, hey, I really don't like these guys. They suck. Like this guy, take a look at him.
704000	710000	Man, who farted in here? No one, I'm cooking dinner. What are you making? Fart lasagna?
710000	716000	What are you doing? Their jokes just fall flat. They're not the greatest actors and they're a bunch of uncharismatic losers.
716000	722000	Nah, that's way too mean. I'm just not a fan, what can I say? And why do we need so many of them? I can't even keep track of what's going on.
722000	731000	If you want to be number one, stop playing games just for fun. Give up your life so you can win and be the best at how it is.
731000	739000	I also kind of miss the charm old Smosh videos had. Where was this Ian and Anthony? They were just two homies having a good time, broing it out, fighting against Pokemon and stuff.
739000	746000	Hell yeah. Right now their videos just kind of feel like a not so great version of SNL for kids. And I'm a big boy.
747000	759000	And starting and stopping shows without consulting me first, which, you know, they had every right to. They owned the company, I was just an employee, but it hurt a little bit.
759000	768000	I felt like I, you know, I created this thing with my buddy and we should kind of be consulted about these things, but it was just a company.
768000	775000	That's another point both Anthony and I brought up in our videos, because we're so in sync. The two of us are actually soulmates. Give me a kiss, Padilla.
775000	784000	Since Smosh and Defy became homies, you can see a bunch of these bullshit series popping up. Like at the point of time when I made my old video last year, they had like four series going on constantly.
784000	790000	And I just found the whole thing a bit pointless. But now they managed to minimize it, so hey, that's cool.
790000	796000	Recently what they've been posting is either made out of every blank ever or sketches. We all love sketches.
796000	801000	Every blank ever is the most simple concept in the world. I don't know how they managed to make so many episodes of it.
801000	807000	It makes sense when it's about this kind of relatable thing like every dad ever. Dads are relatable, you know dads.
807000	812000	But now they're making every Harry Potter ever. Is that relatable?
812000	814000	Harry, you look tired.
814000	817000	Are you doing that mind connection thing with Voldemort again?
817000	818000	Maybe.
818000	820000	Well don't you see that that puts us in danger?
820000	821000	Yeah.
821000	826000	Oh, so it's just a Harry Potter parody. I see. Can't you just call it like Harry Potter parody or something like that?
826000	830000	Another thing they do is their good old sketches. Some of them are honestly not that awful.
830000	836000	I do have certain issues with them that I will discuss in my next bit, but some of them are actually scripted by the Smosh cast members.
836000	840000	So I think that's pretty cool. Keeps it authentic. No, they still made this.
856000	857000	Screw those dudes!
857000	859000	You just killed some art!
859000	861000	Ooh, that is... that is not so great.
861000	866000	Now my last problem in Smosh's change of content is that it all feels kind of... plastic.
866000	868000	And I'll explain exactly what I mean.
868000	873000	Smosh used to have that very homey kind of feeling. It was very authentic.
873000	878000	And at the beginning of them joining Defy, they still did some really cool stuff. Like all those hard ass songs.
887000	892000	Mmm, yeah bitch, that's my jam.
892000	897000	And that's the positive part of being bought by such a huge company. You have more money to do cool stuff.
897000	901000	But as you go on and on and on, you see that they kind of lost the original Smosh touch.
901000	907000	They opened all these random ass channels and kept posting more and more shit until they eventually just became a factory for skits for kids.
907000	910000	Which pretty much meant that they were... not fun.
910000	912000	Smosh used to mean Ian and Anthony.
912000	917000	But you can notice that the brand attached so far away from the two, that the fact that Anthony left wasn't even noticeable.
917000	922000	Watch a Smosh video from a week before Anthony left, and a Smosh video that was uploaded a few weeks ago.
922000	924000	And you'll get the completely same kind of vibe.
924000	928000	I'm gonna show you two clips and you'll have to tell me which one was made before and after Anthony left.
928000	929000	Check this shit out.
929000	938000	Before we open those doors, let us take a moment to remember the hardworking employees that lost their lives on Black Friday Past.
940000	943000	Hey, don't be nervous. You look so great.
943000	946000	I just, I really want your friends to like me.
946000	950000	Ah, yeah, you'll probably never guess it. No point in going on with this game.
950000	952000	It just kind of feels like a wet slice of bread.
952000	956000	It's not really interesting, it's not fun, and it's absolutely not tasty.
956000	961000	But since it's the Christmas-y, snowflake-y kind of time, I'm gonna be a really nice guy.
961000	964000	And I'm gonna finish this on a positive note.
964000	966000	I'm kind of optimistic about the future of Smosh.
966000	968000	Now that they're out of the Defy chains, they're finally free.
968000	972000	And looking at the way Anthony described it, Defy kind of screwed them over.
972000	975000	But now they can do whatever their smoshy heart desires.
975000	980000	Hopefully now, since this big bad corporation isn't behind them, that'll lead to them doing good stuff.
980000	984000	I was, um, given access to all the channels, so...
984000	985000	So we're just gonna...
985000	987000	Ian hacked the main frame.
987000	990000	So, we're just gonna be putting out some stuff.
990000	991000	It's gonna do it.
991000	992000	It's gonna be, uh, old school.
992000	993000	Yeah, it's...
993000	995000	I gotta say, this is, like, really fun.
996000	1000000	Wow, that is truly inspiring.
1000000	1001000	Good job.
1001000	1002000	Anyways, I'm done for the day.
1002000	1004000	Let's go back to James.
1004000	1005000	Subscribe to me.
1005000	1006000	Thank you, Pinely.
1006000	1008000	I'll leave his link in the pinned comment.
1008000	1009000	Go and check him out.
1009000	1014000	He makes fantastically unique content, which is definitely what we need more of on this platform.
1014000	1016000	Let's hope corporations don't get to him as well.
1016000	1019000	However, jokes aside, this is business in many ways.
1019000	1021000	Nothing more, nothing less.
1021000	1028000	But the control exercise over Smosh was not just a message of the relationships between the creator and the audience and the business,
1028000	1036000	but also what happens when you relinquish a control of an idea to people who may not have your own reputation at the heart of their concerns.
1036000	1041000	The thing is that a combination of a business and Smosh is probably not the worst combination possible.
1041000	1044000	As mentioned, Ian and Anthony weren't the most defiant people.
1044000	1049000	Alloy and subsequently Defy probably benefited greatly on the revenue from these creators.
1049000	1053000	However, the problem was, although Smosh was by no means a dead channel,
1053000	1059000	and in fact, in the months running up to the closure of Defy Media they were having some of their most successful months in a significant while,
1059000	1064000	there was no way to fully recapture that magic and the success of peak Smosh.
1064000	1069000	Even if Smosh was pulling in the revenue, their other projects owned by Defy Media just weren't.
1069000	1074000	Screen Junkies and The Escapists were both sold off for reasons that we'll probably cover very soon.
1074000	1079000	And Clevver TV, despite having four different channels with struggling with uploads and views alike,
1079000	1083000	there is still a market for the sort of middle-of-the-road content that many of these channels do.
1083000	1089000	But the clickbait is one of the main factors, and it is so competitive these days that you're competing with other businesses
1089000	1094000	who are more ruthless and know their audiences better and have corporation channels built from scratch,
1094000	1099000	not just ones that have undergone the treatments and have had to sacrifice something in the process.
1099000	1105000	Defy Media had confined their content to a streamlined business model, which wasn't really a good idea.
1105000	1109000	But Smosh, in spite of all this, as said, was still relatively successful.
1109000	1114000	It's hard to see how a media corporation would be losing revenue with something like Smosh.
1114000	1119000	At the end of the day, they were in control. They also had partnerships with other YouTubers like Chris Stutman,
1119000	1122000	who should have turned in money at no cost to them whatsoever.
1122000	1128000	They were probably making bank. How on earth could you be making a net negative income with so many ventures
1128000	1135000	and so much outreach? They should have had every exit covered, but they didn't.
1144000	1149000	Now I just criticised Defy Media for their business model that was set up for their content creators,
1149000	1154000	mainly because I felt it sacrificed a lot of the identity, and on top of that, it was very singular
1154000	1159000	and therefore made it fragile if the tides became rough. However, they did have some backup models
1159000	1165000	that they were utilising throughout their few years of operation, one of which was known as programmatic advertising.
1165000	1170000	Now, programmatic advertising is a very broad subject, so it becomes extremely hard to explain the model
1170000	1175000	that Defy may have been using. Typically, it's online advertising. It's a bit more targeted, basically.
1175000	1181000	They also had their foot in licensing and quote, video syndication operations, which is basically pushing content
1181000	1187000	on various sites. Basically, to summarise, they had additional business in promoting other people's content.
1187000	1191000	Not necessarily YouTube content, it could have been anything, but advertising.
1191000	1196000	Now, I'm not suggesting that there is anything wrong with that, but it appears that they weren't entirely happy
1196000	1201000	with the business it brought, and neither were their clients. Around the start to mid-2018,
1201000	1206000	they decided to close down that branch of their business, thus being able to focus on their content.
1206000	1212000	In a way, this should have given them more power to be able to focus on the content that may have been stagnating a tad,
1212000	1217000	but unfortunately, it brought new issues. As I mentioned, it's hard to see why a company like Defy Media,
1217000	1222000	with all its outlets and history of making great income, should ever be struggling with finance.
1222000	1227000	And anyhow, why is the fact that they had other businesses remotely relevant for discussing their failure?
1227000	1233000	Well, you see, after they decided to withdraw from these businesses, there were compadres who came after them,
1233000	1239000	for unpaid debt. Now, it's hard to say whether this debt was merely a symptom of their financial troubles,
1239000	1243000	however, whatever businesses they were involved in, they clearly hadn't ended well.
1243000	1247000	Despite the fact that they had basically swindled one of the largest YouTube channels in the world,
1247000	1252000	out of its creators for absolutely nothing, they were too incompetent to keep their head above water,
1252000	1255000	and their business dealings had clearly failed them.
1255000	1260000	There were even the targets of a lawsuit fired by some disgruntled partners for ads run on their website.
1260000	1266000	It was reaching that stage where people needed to abandon ship. Wherever the money was, no one out there knew,
1266000	1272000	or at least there was no transparency. In his video, Stutman detailed how he was made aware of the difficulties.
1272000	1277000	I saw a lot of behind the scenes things at Defy that just seemed wishy-washy.
1277000	1283000	On the other hand, Anthony and the clever TV host, Jocelyn Davis, seem to be fairly oblivious to the issues surrounding the company.
1283000	1287000	Did you know this was going to happen? Absolutely not.
1287000	1291000	Anthony was even under the impression that they were hiring people weeks before they closed their doors.
1291000	1294000	They were hiring people weeks ago.
1294000	1301000	It's quite sensational how in the dark many of these people seem to be, and I don't think they have any motivation to feign ignorance,
1301000	1303000	so I have no reason to disbelieve them.
1303000	1309000	And you know what? Maybe, just maybe, if the crime of non-informing their employees to their careers were going to be taken away from them
1309000	1318000	instantaneously, with no chance, no chance for a person to perhaps preemptively look up new occupations to fill so that they can pay their rent for next month.
1318000	1322000	Maybe, just maybe, I would have been able to say, you're not shitty people.
1322000	1331000	But, in the words of the philosopher, great philosopher Billy Mays, there's more, and I'm not happy about this, not one bit.
1331000	1339000	Firstly, given the company have had their assets frozen and their doors closed, as far as I can tell, no employee will be receiving substantial severance pay.
1339000	1346000	And to add to this, many creators who have been earning money for months through their videos received zilch from the last couple months of AdSense.
1346000	1359000	So, my entire Halloween special, all those massive videos I worked on, everything I worked on in September and October, I will probably not receive a dime for.
1359000	1363000	This is where the difference between Smosh and Chris Stutman comes into play.
1363000	1369000	With regards to Chris, when we partner with a multi-channel network, they become the prime beneficiaries of our AdSense revenue.
1369000	1374000	However, we typically sign a contract that will allocate the money predominantly back to us.
1374000	1384000	In Chris's case, the contract that he signed was so that he would receive 100% of the AdSense revenue, with the only income going to Defy through required sponsorships.
1384000	1394000	This changed when at the start of 2018, Defy approached Chris and requested that they change the AdSense split so that they can receive a 10% portion as they had hit financial difficulties.
1394000	1402000	Chris reluctantly agreed. This worsened when they carried on deferring its monthly ad revenue payments week after week after week.
1402000	1406000	This was an experience a lot of creators in Defy Media appeared to be having.
1406000	1410000	Creators just being completely ignored, despite the fact that they had earned that money.
1410000	1423000	We, as creators, work damn hard to accumulate any dollar we can, and when they're not obstructed by copyright claims, demonetisation, and various other obstacles, creators should be able to rely on receiving the money that they have earned.
1423000	1428000	Now, I haven't read a Defy Media contract. I don't know if they were legally allowed to do this.
1428000	1433000	However, whether legal or not, I'm making a moral call here and saying that it was shitty.
1433000	1439000	What you have here is a classic case of corporate denial. They have a problem where they think they're in debt and they don't know how to traverse it.
1439000	1445000	What they do is they think, well, we can invest some of our own creators' money into it and we'll reimburse them when we're out of this dark spell.
1445000	1450000	After all, how bad can it get? It gets bad. Worse and worse and worse.
1450000	1465000	Suddenly, you've left disenfranchised creators out of pocket for money that they earned through the creation of their content that has generated profits that you have claimed and subsequently refused to return, and you're in the grand total of $10 million of debt.
1465000	1467000	How the hell do you manage that?
1467000	1475000	This is what you have. A mess. An absolute mess in which Defy have completely screwed over their creators and their employees alike.
1475000	1481000	So what is the situation now? Where is the money? Well, many allege it is now with the bank who froze the assets.
1481000	1489000	No one knows what's gonna happen with it now. People might file disputes or claims against various parties, but if there's no money left, then there's a chance that no one will see any of it.
1489000	1496000	It's bloody annoying. The companies can do that. But at the end of the day, if the money isn't there, it isn't there.
1496000	1501000	It's clear that Defy Media were not ready for the changing environment, whether it was on YouTube or off YouTube.
1501000	1506000	They could not keep up, and when their investments caught up to them, they didn't know what to do.
1506000	1514000	And sometimes businesses fail. Sometimes people lose out. It is an inevitability in the society that we live in, because we do live in a society.
1514000	1522000	However, equally, when you're dealing with people's livelihoods, there can be no doubt in the irresponsibility in the handling of this company's demise.
1522000	1528000	If your company is failing, you shouldn't play such a gamble of other people's lives in some vain hope that it might just recover.
1528000	1537000	It was clear that this company was a dead business walking months ago, and the fact that the business appeared to refuse acknowledgement of these problems to people who relied on the business,
1537000	1543000	and then basically stole from the creators who had taken the plunge to share their income with them in the first place, it is disgusting.
1543000	1553000	They've taken so much and wasted it all. However, that is the system, and on that day, many established creators were subjected to the system.
1553000	1560000	Now we can try and change the system with regards to it, but that's much more deeply rooted in legality that is exceptionally complex and difficult.
1560000	1567000	What we can do is respond to this more astutely in the future with acknowledgement and awareness of the current system.
1568000	1577000	They've devoted so much of their life to making Smosh what it is, and they just completely betrayed it.
1577000	1583000	There are lessons that can be taken away for everyone. The business, the creator, and perhaps even the viewer.
1583000	1589000	When you're dealing with content, you're still dealing with people. Although Defy slash Alloy weren't necessarily lying,
1589000	1595000	it was still rather disingenuous that the business sold proverbial stock to the Smosh founders, which was basically useless.
1595000	1602000	It was useless. Selling away your own brainchild for nothing would have to be one of the worst experiences to me.
1602000	1609000	I don't think I'd ever be able to do something like that, so I do legitimately feel bad for Anthony and Ian, even if they should have known better.
1609000	1613000	It doesn't make it right their ignorance was exploited by people who did know better.
1613000	1620000	In whatever interactions I'm involved in, if someone's trying to make a decision that requires information they may not be aware of,
1620000	1627000	and additional context, then I will work to make sure that they are informed to the best of their ability before they make that decision.
1627000	1632000	I think that's something that we should all work with, especially in high state situations like this.
1632000	1639000	However, going forward, we should also acknowledge our responsibility to be better informed, to avoid exploitation.
1639000	1642000	Sure, if someone takes advantage of it, then they're still somewhat in the wrong.
1642000	1648000	But if you leave your door open to the house and someone burgles it, there has to be some sort of responsibility.
1648000	1652000	You can still think of ways to be better prepared. Does it vindicate the burglar?
1652000	1655000	No, of course not. He should be arrested and dealt with sufficiently.
1655000	1662000	However, you can see why these things are always a sign of mutual responsibility, because we're better off for it.
1662000	1668000	From this, you also have to acknowledge that if you're selling away a brand, then you're selling away its foreseeable future.
1668000	1672000	As Anthony acknowledged, they were essentially made employees of the company.
1673000	1680000	I felt like I created this thing with my buddy, and we should kind of be consulted about these things, but it was just a company.
1680000	1683000	Nothing more than that, and I was nothing more than an employee.
1683000	1690000	Employees can be fired. Part of the reason that Anthony and Ian weren't were because they were viewed as somewhat integral to the brand.
1690000	1695000	But it did mean that they were messed around a lot, completely left out of some decision making processes,
1695000	1698000	and then had their reputation smeared because of it.
1698000	1706000	The fact that Smosh was able to continue as a separate brand after Anthony left was a clear indication that Anthony was completely correct
1706000	1709000	in the fact that the brand had turned into something alien from him.
1709000	1714000	If one of them had left in 2010, then I'm sure the reaction would have been very different.
1714000	1718000	But I'm gonna put a pin in that, because I think that's a really interesting discussion for another time.
1718000	1727000	Point being, that if you're someone with a product that you care about, it's so easy to see what you love being gradually eroded into something you don't recognise,
1727000	1731000	and by then it's too late. If that's okay with you, then that's okay with you.
1731000	1737000	Sometimes we do need that extra backing to move forward as creators, but you have to anticipate the consequences.
1737000	1741000	As an employer, you need to be upfront with your employees. Businesses don't work out sometimes,
1741000	1744000	we've all had projects that just fall apart in front of our eyes,
1744000	1748000	but if it's not working, don't smile in people's face while you empty their pockets,
1748000	1751000	under the premise that you won't be reprimanded for it anyway.
1751000	1755000	They're just as human as you, and be ready for content that you make to lose its audiences,
1755000	1760000	especially when you change it in a way that its original audience no longer identify it as.
1760000	1767000	In a way, Defy Media were bound to go extinct because the way they acquired these little ventures in the first place was no longer viable.
1767000	1773000	The modern day and up and coming YouTubers would laugh in your face if you tried to do to them what Defy did to Smosh,
1773000	1779000	and they'd also probably make a 10 minute video on it so they can cash in on how low and pathetic you are,
1779000	1782000	with a few juicy mid-rolls in there too, insult to injury.
1782000	1788000	Still, there was no attempt to adapt, no attempt to reconcile the content, no attempt to grow out that money tree,
1788000	1794000	all while it was being uprooted elsewhere because your other business partakings had failed, miserably.
1794000	1799000	The whole demeanour of the company in dealing with its financial woes can be summarised as pathetic.
1799000	1805000	For any budding creators, do not partner unless you're confident that they can stay committed to your interests,
1805000	1808000	and aren't just gonna take the money and run. Equally, read the contract.
1808000	1812000	It's very easy for many of us to overlook terms and conditions when signing various things,
1812000	1816000	because 99% of terms and conditions are 100% trivial.
1816000	1820000	But this is the 1%. Being in a contract can be a huge step forward.
1820000	1825000	I'm not saying it doesn't have its benefits, but unless there's an element of trust, then you're risking it all.
1825000	1830000	One of the huge benefits for being in a network is the fact that given the current monetisation setup,
1830000	1836000	many people aren't eligible, and being eligible often takes months to apply for if you're not in the network.
1836000	1840000	And so, there is the notion of something being better than nothing, but I would really emphasise,
1840000	1844000	if they don't care enough to cater the contract at least somewhat to your preferences,
1844000	1850000	then they don't care enough to not exploit you. Even established creators have been fucked over here.
1850000	1854000	It may not always be the case, but in this instance I believe that patience is a virtue,
1854000	1857000	and that working hard and waiting for the right deal can pay off.
1857000	1862000	Equally, I think one of the most prominent problems with creators are those who sign themselves up to contracts
1862000	1868000	that they are bound to for a set amount of time. If you can obtain some sort of escape clause so you're not dragged down,
1868000	1873000	if the company nosedives, then do it. I honestly can't see myself signing up to a contract
1873000	1877000	that would not give me the option to leave if the circumstances change,
1877000	1880000	and I am no longer happy with the company's treatment of me as a creator.
1880000	1884000	It is a case of supply and demand. If people adopt that philosophy,
1884000	1888000	then companies will at least have to alter their approach to certain contracts.
1888000	1892000	We all know the nightmares of copyright, demonetisation, and algorithms,
1892000	1897000	but not every response is a solution. Don't just go from the oven into the frying pan.
1897000	1901000	You'll get burned either way. Obviously, I doubt any of this will have a huge impact,
1901000	1905000	but I hope the whole saga at least does influence people's perspective.
1905000	1909000	Companies are going to take advantage of people. I can call it shitty all I like,
1909000	1913000	but it's also a part of the competitive business that they take what they can get.
1913000	1919000	I guess what annoys me the most about Defy Media, then, is that in spite of all the conniving conduct
1919000	1925000	they participated in, in spite of all the business, in spite of all the shaking down of creators,
1925000	1931000	they still failed astronomically, and they went down dragging every other person down with them,
1931000	1936000	people who had worked for them, who had given them their time and money and creative energy.
1936000	1941000	It is shambolic, and everyone affected deserved better than that.
1941000	1945000	The business hides amongst the tall grass of content creators.
1945000	1949000	Very few people will know what Defy Media was in a few months time, nor will they care,
1949000	1955000	and yet their influence is just as, or even more powerful than the smiling host who is presented to you.
1955000	1960000	Just because they seem insignificant when they approach you, doesn't mean you should underestimate their power,
1960000	1964000	because the facelessness of an MCN arguably just makes them more powerful,
1964000	1970000	due to the lesser levels of accountability. It is unlikely that any of Defy Media will face consequences.
1970000	1974000	That's the way it is sometimes, but we can equip ourselves to know better,
1974000	1977000	and hopefully we will know better in the future.
1979000	1985000	So, that was the video. It was a passionate one, I tell you, but I care about these topics.
1985000	1991000	Please, once again, go and check out Pinely, he is a fantastic creator, and I love him very much.
1991000	1996000	We've known each other since we were whippersnappers, YouTube whippersnappers at least,
1996000	2000000	and he's still here, and he's still making content, and that's strong commitment.
2000000	2004000	I love him a lot, please check him out, and he's really attractive too.
2004000	2008000	No homo? I'm going to leave Pinely's link in the pinned comment below.
2008000	2012000	Also, I want to give a huge shoutout to the editors, they have once again done a great job,
2012000	2016000	please go and check them out, I'm going to leave their links in the pinned comment.
2016000	2020000	Alongside Pinely, it's like a little hall of fame down there.
2020000	2024000	The exceedingly generous Patreons are up on screen now, I cannot thank them enough,
2024000	2032000	and I would also like to personally thank Ryan, who once again, donating $100, amazing, sensational, beautiful man.
2032000	2038000	I give him a round of applause for that. However, if you're still here, if you're still listening to this lovely British voice,
2038000	2043000	make sure you go and check all those lads out, they're great, they do a top notch job, and I can't thank them enough.
2043000	2048000	And if you have any thoughts on this video, leave them in the comments below, it's always welcome.
2048000	2055000	I love discussion, and I'm proud to say that I'd say The Right Opinion has one of the most civil fan bases in modern history,
2055000	2060000	which is quite a positive thing. I don't really know what else to say, I love you guys, I'm really tired,
