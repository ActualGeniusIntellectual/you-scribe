00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,760
Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with

2
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:17,760
too much free time, and recently I have been the recipient of shocking allegations, that

3
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:24,420
I am frankly, astounded, anyone would suggest. These are, of course, the allegations that

4
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:31,740
I am, in fact, not a gamer. I know my friends, I am as outraged as you are, once again,

5
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:37,680
the pineapple on pizza loving heathens have the audacity to cast doubt on my gamer credentials,

6
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,080
needless to say, I would be crying at the club if it was open. So, I guess I will have

7
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:47,520
to debunk these claims by taking on another gamer topic, one which will serve as indisputable

8
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,720
evidence for my unflinching gamer status. But first, let's talk about another curious

9
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:54,680
video game that serves as the backdrop for today's subject.

10
00:00:54,680 --> 00:01:13,000
Half Life, it's a video game for gamers, like me, who wish to immerse themselves in

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,960
a first person shooter with a bit more depth, with the first being released in 1998, the

12
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:22,120
second in 2004, and further successive instalments being released in 2006 and 2007, as well

13
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:25,980
as some additional expansion packs in between. The first game focuses around an individual

14
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:30,040
by the name of Gordon Freeman, who like many people, triggers an alien invasion when an

15
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:34,120
experiment that he's running opens up a dimensional rift in time and space. Obviously, antics

16
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:38,860
ensue and he finds himself up against a diverse plethora of enemies in his mission to return

17
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:43,420
stability to this facility and the planet alike. Obviously, my synopsis of these games

18
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:47,060
will remain relatively short, so I don't spoil it for anyone planning to play it themselves,

19
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:50,940
but generally speaking, it's considered by many to be one of the greatest games ever

20
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:54,700
published, and this is the same story with its successor, Half Life 2, which follows

21
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:59,100
our good friend Gordon a couple decades on after the events of the first. It incorporates

22
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:03,040
many elements present in its predecessor, while adding new features and improving on

23
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,420
existing ones. In spite of their shooter status, the series was characterised by its heightened

24
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:11,620
sense of ambition, with Valve president Gabe Newell stating that if Half Life 2 isn't

25
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:15,740
viewed as the best PC game of all time, it's going to completely bum out most of the guys

26
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:20,820
on this team, but Gabe need not have feared. It was released to universal acclaim from

27
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:25,140
reviewers and audiences alike, and is also regarded as one of the greatest games of all

28
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:30,160
time. After the success of the first two games, the developers decided to further metamorphose

29
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,300
their approach, with the plan to release a trilogy of episodes, continuing the story

30
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:38,860
from the lens of our protagonist and a new non-player character by the name of Alex Vance,

31
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:42,540
a lovely young lady who was present in the previous game, who is now receiving a more

32
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:46,600
prominent role as a companion to Mr Freeman here. The first two episodes released a highly

33
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:50,460
positive reception, however, it wasn't quite equivalent to the rampant appraisal that the

34
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:54,660
previous games had received, though this did not appear to deter them. Episode 3 should

35
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:59,100
have completed this trilogy, and was planned for release in Christmas 2007, however was

36
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:03,500
initially postponed, and then cancelled following a sequence of delays and changes to company

37
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:07,500
trajectory. Since then, there has been a lot of speculation as to when the long anticipated

38
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,600
Half-Life 3 will be released, in fact, as I'm sure many of you know, there is an infamous

39
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:16,180
meme revolving around people's rather excitable nature to seek confirmation on the game's

40
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:19,780
announcement, indulged by many throughout the industry. On Wikipedia, there is a page

41
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:24,700
exclusively dedicated to documenting unreleased Half-Life games. It seems that in spite of

42
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:28,700
their revered status within gamer society, the hype surrounding prospective Half-Life

43
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:33,420
projects precedes them. The series had elevated itself to this cult level status, and wherever

44
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:37,480
there's a devoted fanbase, there's typically market potential. Combine this with the desire

45
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:41,660
for simply more Half-Life content, yet a significant lack of it in the decade following

46
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:46,240
the uncompleted trilogy, and people were longing for a saviour, holding out for a hero to give

47
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:51,080
them what they wanted. And from the darkness came an unlikely salvation, but was it the

48
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,680
one we needed, or the one we deserved?

49
00:03:53,680 --> 00:04:17,200
This is Hunt Down The Freeman, it is a fan made spin-off game of Half-Life, released

50
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:22,360
in 2018. It's plot, unlike other Half-Life releases, follows the character Mitchell Shepherd,

51
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:26,120
a member from one of the groups hostile to Freeman in the first instalment, as he attempts

52
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:30,800
to track down and subsequently slay our hero. It is a revenge-themed first person shooter

53
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:36,480
developed and published by Royal Rudious Entertainment, who's CEO is Joe Connors. However, the credit

54
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:42,640
really must go to the director, producer, and writer, Birkin de Nizarin, who also goes

55
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:47,320
by the name of Frank, presumably because his full title is a bit of a mouthful. The game's

56
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:52,360
release was met with denunciation and opprobrium from all ends of the industry spectrum, alongside

57
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:56,000
controversy surrounding many aspects of the game's development. However, that does not

58
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,320
make it particularly exceptional in the grand scheme of things, many video games are embroiled

59
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,860
in their fair share of for all. So why are we here today? The devs thought it'd be a

60
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:10,280
great idea to ask a bunch of YouTubers to voice for the game, and somehow, I wasn't

61
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:20,200
the worst. You see, Hunt Down The Freeman ran a very interesting marketing strategy,

62
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:25,040
which included the decision to take the daring step in casting YouTubers amongst their ensemble.

63
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:28,960
Obviously, given YouTube's performative nature, this may have made sense on paper,

64
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,720
however, it didn't quite translate in practice.

65
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:56,000
Following the release, this led to a tidal wave of publicity, where castigation was fused

66
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,060
with a peculiar amusement and curiosity at how such a disaster piece came into being.

67
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:05,540
It became the target of critics and commentators alike, whose coverage enshrined the game's

68
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:10,380
status amongst audiences, causing many to wonder exactly how this happened.

69
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:15,280
Well, today my friends, I attempt to unpack that mystery, and the controversy surrounding

70
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:20,260
the most ambitious crossover in modern history. Comrades, I suggest we waste no more time

71
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:26,020
on idle chatter and cut into the meat of this juicy, juicy joint. Friends, let's hunt

72
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:40,060
down that Freeman. To understand the beginnings of this curious case, we should probably go back to 2016,

73
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:45,020
because as I'm sure you're aware, a game can often take many years to grow from its humble roots,

74
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:50,420
and Hunt Down The Freeman was no exception. Nonetheless, its origins are a bit of a mystery in a way,

75
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:55,340
because they begin with the man Birkin, hailing from the glorious Turkey, initially not particularly

76
00:06:55,380 --> 00:07:01,340
proficient in English, although having active accounts only sprung into action in the latter half of the 2010s.

77
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:07,180
Not too much is known about him prior to then, the Tommy Wiseau of video games per se, and I'll tell you,

78
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:12,060
the similarities do not end there. When our good friend Birkin here had the idea for Hunt Down The Freeman,

79
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:18,100
he was motivated, he was driven, and he decided to assemble a crack team who could help bring his vision into fruition.

80
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:23,940
There was clear development going on behind the scenes in 2015. A tweet in August of that year has Birkin

81
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:29,260
announcing work on a new game, and although it's mostly quiet after that, we can pin the day that it was

82
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:35,660
officially announced to the 5th of July 2016, the day after American independence. People were going to be in

83
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:41,180
high spirits, and there was surely no better way to maintain this morale than to launch Hunt Down The Freeman's

84
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:47,420
IndieGoGo crowdfunding project. To garner further attention, it was also posted on Steam's Greenlight feature.

85
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:52,660
Greenlight is a now-retired system which allowed indie developers to pay a nominal fee to announce upcoming

86
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:58,500
projects, with users subsequently voting on their sentiments towards the game. In the IndieGoGo and Greenlight pages,

87
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:03,980
there were links to what we can assume was a trailer, some gameplay, and an interview that was posted a few days later,

88
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:08,820
accompanied by some screenshots. There is a version of the trailer still assessable on another channel,

89
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:11,300
which demonstrates the quality being displayed here.

90
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:29,300
When Hunt Down The Freeman's page was listed on Greenlight, the response could probably be evaluated as lukewarm at

91
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:34,580
best. The concept may have been interesting, but many people expressed reservations over various aspects of the

92
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:40,140
game, ranging from qualms with creative choices such as the cutscenes, an issue which I'll dissect in a bit, to

93
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:46,100
concerns encompassing the actual legality of such a game. Our good friend Birkin here was kind enough to open a Q&A

94
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:51,300
thread where he would discuss anybody's queries, however, almost immediately, he ended up in a rather obstinate

95
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:56,700
debate with a user over the liability of such a venture. They ask if our friend Frankie here has permission from

96
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:02,100
Valve to set up the game in the Half-Life universe, and he responds, stating that Valve lets people use their IP

97
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:07,940
source mods. The person then points out that he is marketing a standalone game, and Birkin responds with,

98
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:15,700
This back and forth continues until it is established that Hunt Down The Freeman is both a mod and a standalone game,

99
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:20,860
but this interaction would not have inspired faith in prospective investors. He was subsequently flooded by further

100
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:26,940
questions over the legality and soundness of the project in question, and shortly after, Birkin decided to make a post

101
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:33,420
addressing people's doubts. This post began by attempting to address misgivings surrounding the budget, as observed,

102
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:38,940
$100,000 was quite a lofty goal, and although that would be modest for many developments, people weren't exactly

103
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:45,260
expecting a AAA release here. However, it appears that there was a reason Birkin had expertly estimated the figure of

104
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:51,460
100 grand. You see, the trailer that we viewed was made with Half-Life 2 assets. The budget in question would allow

105
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:57,180
the developers to purchase their own assets, as well as licenses for the content. You see, Birkin didn't want this to

106
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:04,340
just be another mod, in his own words, he wanted it to be a professional game. Now, if you ignore the irony of

107
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:10,260
professional being spelled wrong, it is hard to deny that Birkin possessed a lot of ambition and faith in his idea,

108
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:15,620
and believed he could convince the audience that this was a worthwhile investment. He clearly believed it himself,

109
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:21,980
and he continued to advocate for it over the coming days in spite of the scoffers and the skeptics. He appeared to hold

110
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:27,340
that outlook that if you're dogged and persistent enough, then you could sell water to a drowning man. There was little

111
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:33,460
doubt about it, Birkin had confidence coming out of his ears. However, sales isn't just confidence, it's about having

112
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:38,620
knowledge of your product, and knowledge of the demographic you're going to be marketing it to, and first impressions

113
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:44,420
are a lot, so the fact that his post appeared uncertain on particular characteristics and technicalities of the game,

114
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:50,460
you did more questions than it did answers. One of the most acclaimed facets of the original Half-Life series were its

115
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:55,980
choice to diminish the use of cutscenes in favour of scripted sequences which allowed the player to maintain control of

116
00:10:55,980 --> 00:11:01,260
their character. This was a bold decision at the time, but it worked, creating a more seamless interrelation between the

117
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:06,380
plotline and the gameplay. With the previews of Hunt Down the Freeman, it seemed that they were going to be relying more

118
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:11,860
heavily on cutscenes to tell the story, which many seemed confused by. Now, obviously, a game can take the creative

119
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:17,420
liberties that it feels comfortable with, and on principle, if it helps create a better product, then so be it. However,

120
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:23,180
in the original, the lack of cutscenes wasn't just any old creative decision, it was a decision that for a long time was

121
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:29,500
identifiable with the series, and if a game alienates itself from a franchise's distinguishable elements, then what

122
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:33,340
appeal does it have to the consumer who is familiar with the established universe?

123
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:48,460
And these cutscenes have an opportunity to tell a story or tell an emotion that normally in gameplay cannot do.

124
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:54,380
There's nothing wrong with providing a new spin, with new features and new ideas, but for many fans, you also need to be

125
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:59,540
in touch with the spirit and the mantra of what made the original game successful, and Birkin was having trouble

126
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:05,260
latching onto that. This issue was most illuminated in an interview a few days later with a creator from the community.

127
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:11,060
Although passionate, driven with ample ability and experience with the Half-Life games, he had trouble justifying the

128
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:11,820
fundraising.

129
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:19,980
The heck is this guy? Now, it's quite possible that you could make the best game ever. I'm not saying that you can't do that,

130
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:25,500
I'm saying that people will say, well, I'm not going to give money to somebody that I've never heard of. How would you

131
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,500
address those people?

132
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:36,620
And now we have opportunity to give people something really, really beautiful. But that's the thing that people ask,

133
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:45,940
why it's $100,000? Oh my God, you want $100,000? People get really suspicious, like, why you want that much?

134
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:55,540
Firstly, 10% of the money goes to the tax and Indiegogo, so there's only $90,000 left. And $50,000 of that just goes to

135
00:12:55,540 --> 00:13:04,580
the licensing of the game. And there's only $40,000. With that $40,000, we have to make all the characters all over again.

136
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:10,180
And it's not like he doesn't have a point here. With the boldness of such objectives, you need a lot of money, but the

137
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:16,860
boldness here bordered on temerity for many prospective supporters, and for someone with no track record in publishing

138
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:23,260
game mods, let alone Half-Life mods, people needed more than his word, and even then, his word could have been a bit

139
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,260
more convincing.

140
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:30,420
And we have to get new textures, and we have to get voice acting. Like, voice acting is not really cheap.

141
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:36,100
It was clear that there was still lots of work to be done, but Birken was ready to put in the hours.

142
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:53,580
That's why I like to announce that we're gonna make a playable demo for Hunt Under Freeman. I was thinking about it,

143
00:13:53,580 --> 00:14:00,700
but I wasn't sure should I do it or not. I see that people didn't understand and question the cutscenes, and how it's

144
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:07,700
gonna work. Like, there's so much different, not like a Half-Life game, and it's not like a Half-Life game, to be

145
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:16,700
honest. I'm not telling it, oh, it's gonna be exact like Half-Life, because I'm not giving you just new levels. I'm

146
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,700
giving you a whole new game.

147
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:24,980
When you're fundraising for an idea which hasn't been fully manufactured yet, trust is a huge constituent. People are

148
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:30,780
giving you money on the back of what they believe you can do, rather than what you've done. Those with a reputation to

149
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:36,100
produce results may have a bit more success on this front. However, someone like Birken simply couldn't win over people

150
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:41,740
with a couple videos and screenshots, and even then, what was currently shown was unlikely to resemble the finished

151
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:48,180
product, as Birken intended to use the capital to purchase new engines, tools, and models, or the preview and trailer

152
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:54,660
for really gay fans was a look at the possible storyline and some design concepts. For many, that was simply not enough.

153
00:14:54,660 --> 00:15:00,340
However, Birken was conscious of this, and following the onslaught of audience concerns, announced the development of a

154
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:06,260
demo, to provide users with further confidence in his ability and potential. He discussed this in the days following

155
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:10,980
the initial Greenlight post, and even in the aforementioned interview, however, the official post declaring this was

156
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:16,980
made on the 11th of July, just under a week after the IndieGoGo page went live. Most responses to this were actually

157
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:22,420
pretty positive, with many expressing anticipation for the upcoming release. However, there were also very few

158
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:28,100
replies, and it was clear that at the time, general interest was dwindling, many had clicked onto the page,

159
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:34,260
saw that there was very little there for them, and moved on. Unfortunately, this was a major miscalculation on the

160
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:40,020
marketing front, you really need to put people in with the preview content to maintain interest, and what was there

161
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:46,540
simply was not sufficient, which led to a lot of users dropping by and not sticking around. They didn't seem to have a

162
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:52,340
plan beyond the immediate community either, appealing to a fan base is not the worst idea, but unless those you appeal

163
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:57,900
to aren't desperate, then they're unlikely to blindly throw their money at it. Even the most brainwashed individuals

164
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:03,420
may support the game or the developments, but as an outsider pledging to alter the fabric of what made the original

165
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:09,620
successful, Birken was barking up the wrong tree. At this point, the only possible vindication could be found in the

166
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:15,260
impending demo release. If it was high enough quality, then it could be used as a springboard to show the capacity of

167
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:21,580
the team behind this vision. So come September, the moment of truth was upon us, and Birken finally, finally had the

168
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:27,100
chance to show those who doubted him what he was really made of. In interviews, he had championed himself as a

169
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:33,100
perfectionist, even citing his chronic perfectionism as the reason that he hadn't released any previous mods.

170
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:39,900
So have you made any mods yourself? Have you created any maps or any mods before?

171
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:45,500
Yes, I did. Actually, I did this like last five years, but I'm a

172
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:50,500
person that when I create something, it has to be perfect, and if it's not perfect,

173
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:58,820
it cannot be outside. So finally, we were able to have a sample of Birken's perfection. What flavour had he achieved?

174
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,980
You think you're so cool with your stick,

175
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,900
bullying citizens.

176
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:13,880
You didn't see what I did. My brothers did. The captain did.

177
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:22,020
You couldn't know anything we lived through. To put it nicely, it was an acquired taste. Now,

178
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:25,460
it wasn't the worst thing ever witnessed to man. By many standards,

179
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:27,300
it was an average playthrough,

180
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:32,340
but that was that it was also not the saving grace of the project needed, and there were glaring gaps in the

181
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:36,620
competency which would have put off many people who may have approached the demo with an open mind.

182
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:39,420
We are under heavy fire.

183
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:44,140
Ally combine forces are dead.

184
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:49,540
The truth is that this content should have been released alongside the fundraiser.

185
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:55,300
This would have given them more time and allow them to iron out any blemishes that were too conspicuous. In too many places,

186
00:17:55,300 --> 00:18:00,580
the output just felt rushed, and maybe it was, given that they were struggling to hang on to subdued

187
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:03,260
interest from the gaming world. Even with that in mind,

188
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:09,520
it probably would have paid dividends to spend a bit more time touching up certain elements, because this is a long-term investment.

189
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:15,140
Users won't expect a demo to be perfect, but as a showcase of the talent behind Birkin's team,

190
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:21,660
there was very little content that would inspire hope in audiences, and certainly not enough to encourage them to give up their hard-earned cash.

191
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:24,900
And after a few months, the Indiegogo project sat at a measly

192
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:31,220
$12 of its 100,000 target, a number that, in spite of all the criticisms,

193
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:38,380
still surprised me, because I assumed that something of this scale and mild publicity would at least have some people donating for the hell

194
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:44,300
of it. But my assumption was incorrect, and in spite of all the names attached to this project, the time invested, and the

195
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:49,820
confidence of its lead, all progress was brought to a halt, and the team seemingly disbanded.

196
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:55,340
There was one silver lining to this cloud, though, and that was that the game had been green-lighted through Steam's process.

197
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:59,620
Nonetheless, if there was no team to take it forward, then this detail was frankly meaningless.

198
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:03,340
However, as I'm sure you know, this was far from the end of the story.

199
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:06,020
You see, some say you can't keep a good man down,

200
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:13,020
but that's not entirely true, because the moral content of one's character doesn't come into it if they're dogged enough, and regardless of

201
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:13,900
Birkin's nature,

202
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:19,620
he was a man on a mission, and was already preparing to renew his efforts once more. Enter stage left,

203
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:21,660
Royal Rudious Entertainment.

204
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:29,540
Royal Rudious Entertainment, or RRE, was the company set up to carry Hunt Down the Freeman forward from its previous shortcomings.

205
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:30,260
With that in mind,

206
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:36,060
it seems that it was being established shortly before the demo was published, and the crowdfunding campaign brought to an end.

207
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:42,460
The Twitter account was set up in August 2016, and although it would be a year until another promotional campaign would be launched,

208
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:47,660
Birkin was working hard, making sure that this time, Hunt Down the Freeman would be a resounding success.

209
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:54,740
A now deleted article published in a Turkish magazine, Technology, disclosed the development in January 2017,

210
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:58,980
which appeared to follow a tweet interaction where an employee stated that they were a part of the project.

211
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:03,500
Once again, bar the occasional tweet, it seems that Birkin chose to keep this venture predominantly under wraps,

212
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:08,780
likely causing it to fade from people's memory, and allowing them to return to their lives of blissful ignorance.

213
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:15,300
Alas, all good things must come to an end, and at the end of 2017, both Birkin and Royal Rudious Entertainment

214
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:20,940
ignited their social media presence to announce that Hunt Down the Freeman was back, and more powerful than ever.

215
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:34,900
But nobody was quite ready for the tricks that Birkin had been hiding up his sleeve, not even some of the tricks themselves.

216
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:39,540
Yes, it seems that they were in for a bit of a shock, but like much of this story,

217
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:44,540
even if you knew what was going to happen, it would still manage to subvert your expectations.

218
00:20:45,300 --> 00:21:00,540
In a way, the fact that Birkin's original fundraiser had flopped so terribly enabled him to move rather seamlessly

219
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:05,580
into what we can assume was his plan B. If the project had originally received moderate support,

220
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:10,100
with some people's expectations resting on it, then the outcome could have been very different.

221
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:13,660
The developers would have needed to keep public donors in the loop with the progress,

222
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:19,020
and this could have led to a consistent stream of scrutiny, which could have accrued the game some lasting notoriety

223
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:24,500
if people became dissatisfied with the product. Instead, by keeping financing and labor behind closed doors,

224
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:28,700
it allowed them to operate and recruit without their previous reputation hampering them.

225
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:34,140
This was particularly vital to their subsequent marketing strategy, which employed a fresh approach for what it was attempting to sell,

226
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:40,060
though at its core was a technique not unheard of. Yes, our good friend Birkin was working behind the scenes on a team

227
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:44,780
that would make the game a hit, but would it make the game good? Well...

228
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:56,460
Birkin's voice, after a few tweets foreshadowing the launch of the long awaited game,

229
00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:02,900
a teaser was posted on January 6th, 2018, with Agri the most infamous character from the original series,

230
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:06,060
G-Man providing exposition for the game's protagonist.

231
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:17,300
I do have to admit, I'm impressed that you made it back, alive from Black Mesa, even if it wasn't our intention to begin with.

232
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:20,940
Alongside came a few statuses from those involved promoting the game.

233
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:27,380
Now, a lot of developers and employers do not have the strongest social media presence, even Birkin's following was quite derisory.

234
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:33,860
However, the game received a significant signal boost from a few creators, many of whom had been recruited by Birkin to voice characters.

235
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:41,060
In fact, the cast appeared to include Pyrocynical, I Hate Everything, ColossusCrazy, and Keemstar,

236
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:45,940
some of whom posted rather roped comments about their involvement, accompanied by a link to the steam page.

237
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:51,580
This provided an extra helping of publicity for their operation, and audience reaction was broadly positive.

238
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:57,500
This is mainly because it focuses on one of the game's strongest assets, the G-Man, whose voice actor does a pretty good job

239
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:00,700
at emulating the original's inflections and intonation.

240
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:06,540
However, if you look beyond this, there were already a few cracks in the visage that should have been cause for concern.

241
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:09,620
Firstly, the scripting in general just felt a bit clunky.

242
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:17,100
Even if it wasn't our intention to begin with, yet you are still here.

243
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:21,500
You should have just died there, but here you are.

244
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:27,620
At this point, he goes from being this foreboding trailer narrator, to verbally tripping over himself in what appears to be

245
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:31,140
outward annoyance at the fact that our protagonist is still alive.

246
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:37,260
I don't think this was the intended tone, I think they were more over attempting to use repetition to engrain the message of the premise.

247
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:42,260
However, its usage is excessive, and comes across as rather graceless in its delivery.

248
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:48,660
Another less noticeable, yet probably more telling red flag, is the G-Man's pronunciation of Black Mesa.

249
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:52,100
Black, alive from Black Mesa.

250
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:57,460
Now, although a more subtle mistake, the fact that nobody involved had corrected the voice actor,

251
00:23:57,460 --> 00:24:03,180
and ensured another take of an otherwise simple line, to me seemed like a failure in elementary diligence.

252
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:07,940
They had more than ample time to prepare this, and they were still falling at basic hurdles.

253
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:13,540
All in all, this would understandably cause reservation amongst people more familiar with the Half-Life series.

254
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:17,940
However, whereas in the past, much of the fandom had controlled the general verdict on the game,

255
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:22,860
here they were outnumbered by those slightly less aware of the details and taken in by the hype,

256
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:25,180
and perhaps the inclusion of their favourite creators.

257
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:28,940
I don't think it's the audience's fault that these flaws may have been overlooked at the time,

258
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:32,180
it's easy to analyse it with the enlightened glory of hindsight.

259
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:34,980
If I was a casual viewer, I probably would have missed it as well.

260
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:40,740
What this does tell us, though, is that Birkin and his team hadn't become any more rigorous when it came to quality control,

261
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:44,100
they'd just found a new way to drown out the incoming criticism.

262
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:48,900
Not too long after the teaser, its Steam page was erected, with the previews posted there as well.

263
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:52,500
The forecast was sunshine and rainbows for the team behind the Half-Life spin-off,

264
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,700
as the music teaser was also released to audience anticipation.

265
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:58,020
However, it wasn't all plain sailing.

266
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:03,620
Yes, many detractors were still present amongst the community, most notably the Lambda Generation Twitter account,

267
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:06,620
representing the, quote, ultimate Half-Life community.

268
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:12,220
Over the next three weeks, Royal Rudeus faced down and addressed accusations regarding general quality control,

269
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:17,660
and more importantly, their use of stolen assets, in their newest trailer and in previous versions of the game,

270
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:19,900
most notably their 2016 demo.

271
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:25,660
One former team member made a public statement chastising Birkin and his management for the organisation of the game,

272
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:30,100
expressing fear that it could permanently damage the reputation of future Half-Life titles.

273
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:33,500
On the same day, Royal Rudeus posted a statement rebuffing these claims,

274
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:38,100
asserting that they had obtained all necessary licenses for assets used in the upcoming release,

275
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:43,780
and holding that although the 2016 demo had used unwarranted placeholders, they had since rectified this.

276
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:46,180
I'm going to save further discussion of this for later.

277
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:52,900
They ended up in a couple more unconvincing interactions where they attempted to distance themselves altogether from the 2016 demo,

278
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:57,700
as well as claiming that Birkin was not party to the inception of Royal Rudeus Entertainment.

279
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:03,140
However, most of this remained within the community, and RRE vowed to press on with the promotion of their game,

280
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:05,700
uploading an official trailer at the end of January.

281
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:07,220
I heard you're looking for a man.

282
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:11,140
A man in an orange suit.

283
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:15,620
A man with a crowbar.

284
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:18,700
Gordon Freeman.

285
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:25,340
It was this video that some issues began to appear more evident, mostly relating to the rather substandard audio mastering.

286
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:32,220
Was gone. Now it's back. A gift for the captain. Do you recognize it?

287
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:37,940
God help us. No. God will stay away from this one.

288
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:43,140
They had reused lines from the teaser, and the additional voice clips wouldn't have inspired much confidence either,

289
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:47,620
with IHG's phrases having vocal acoustics which did not remotely reflect the setting.

290
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:51,940
In fact, I question if anyone had even put his audio through a single filter.

291
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:56,380
I just don't understand why it's such an important thing. The captain needs to see it.

292
00:26:56,380 --> 00:27:01,940
These were schoolboy errors, which becomes even worse when you consider that the trailer is meant to show the good parts.

293
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:06,740
With this upload, the reception was strikingly more negative, and although some people were still excited,

294
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:11,100
there was a trace of reservation and straight up cynicism from many viewers.

295
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:15,460
However, the curiosities still remain, and with the release date set for February 2nd,

296
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:19,940
there was only a few days until the masses would finally have their say on this enigma.

297
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:24,060
However, Team Broken wasn't as ready as they said they were.

298
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:44,820
This was a triumph. I'm making a note here. Huge success.

299
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:46,300
Yeah, this game sucks.

300
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:51,380
It's hard to overstate my satisfaction.

301
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:53,580
Holy shit, the game does not work.

302
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:55,140
Yeah, but you're science.

303
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:57,340
Everything about the game is a huge mess.

304
00:27:57,340 --> 00:28:00,460
We do what we must because we can.

305
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:02,620
So fast forward to the game coming out, everyone hates it.

306
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:07,660
For the good of all of us, except the ones who are dead.

307
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:08,140
Who wrote this?

308
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:10,300
But there's no sense crying over any of this.

309
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:12,140
My fellow Americans.

310
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:16,100
You just keep on trying till you run out of cake.

311
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:26,340
And the science gets done and you make a neat run for the people who are still alive.

312
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:30,580
Ahem. What do you think you're doing?

313
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:37,820
Well, I literally just finished Portal two minutes ago and you can't just go barging into people's monitor, bro.

314
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:40,140
I won't when you finish your damn video.

315
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:42,420
Do you even know when the deadline is?

316
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,740
Yeah, it's a week from now, right?

317
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:47,620
No. The deadline was a week ago.

318
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:48,420
What?

319
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:52,100
Just finish the damn video. I already sent the audio.

320
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:55,500
I'll be watching you until then.

321
00:28:55,500 --> 00:29:25,260
Hello and again, welcome to the Aperture Science Computer Aided Enrichment Center Hunt Down The Response is edited by LuckyMeAndChloe.

322
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:29,620
As the date loomed, many waited with bated breath to see what this game would bring us.

323
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:33,820
However, on the 31st of January, just before the second trailer was uploaded,

324
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:38,140
an announcement was posted by a good amigo Birkin regarding the status of the game.

325
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:43,900
He thanked people for their support, but also acknowledged one of the prevalent concerns voiced by many regarding the file size.

326
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:47,380
He expresses sympathy and says that they have been working on a solution.

327
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:52,220
However, we'll need more time to implement this, and thus we'll be delaying the release by six days.

328
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:57,340
This has formalized the following day on the Steam page, with the date being moved back to February the 8th.

329
00:29:57,340 --> 00:30:02,260
Okay, so just under a week, gamers have seen far worse delays in their time,

330
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:07,300
and people were willing to wait a bit longer if it allowed the developers to make a game more accessible for users.

331
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:13,100
However, come February the 8th, another post was published stating that they will be deferring release once more,

332
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:17,180
this time to perfect the game, in hopes that it will be primed for application.

333
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:22,940
RRE also made the tangential comment that they didn't realize they had 50 levels until a few hours ago,

334
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:27,980
which I think is an attempt to hype up the game, but just makes them seem more incompetent.

335
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:31,660
Like, you didn't plan how many levels you were gonna have.

336
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:38,820
So although bemusing, it was also believable, given that some dips in quality had been seen in certain previews.

337
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:42,420
So people once more shrugged their shoulders and bided their time.

338
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:48,220
The new date was set for February the 15th, and as it came around, you can probably guess what happened.

339
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:52,940
Another delay. Oh, joy.

340
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:59,180
This time, it was bound for the cause of this postponement, as they were to test and approve the game before release.

341
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:00,740
How inconvenient.

342
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:04,460
It likely surprised many people that this had not been arranged in advance,

343
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,060
but given the organization of the project thus far,

344
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:12,220
I suppose it wasn't beyond belief that they had just tacked this onto the end of an already shambolic rigmarole.

345
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:27,220
🎵Music🎵

346
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:31,140
Nonetheless, the post in question seemed to be their flimsiest explanation yet,

347
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:35,380
and there were only so many times they could tantalise their patrons in such a way.

348
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:41,500
However, this time they pledged it would be their final delay, and that February the 21st would be the day of reckoning.

349
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:47,180
So the day came around, the time was upon us, the court of public opinion was in session,

350
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:50,220
we could finally find out- no, never mind, it was delayed again.

351
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:55,420
At the trajectory this game was on, this video wasn't going to be a retrospective.

352
00:31:55,420 --> 00:32:02,780
It was becoming such a circus that even members of the team were beginning to publicly vent their exasperation at the handling of the launch.

353
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:10,620
However, we were spared further suffering on the 23rd of February, when the game was finally unveiled on Steam to a triumphant fanfare.

354
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:12,460
Was it worth the wait?

355
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:16,860
It also fairly obviously nicked a lot of its new content, weapons and level architecture from asset stores and other mods,

356
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:18,700
as again, some of it looked competently made.

357
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:23,020
But it's all been dropped into the game with the care and precision with which turds are placed in the bottom of a budgie cage.

358
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:26,780
The kind of thing where you're walking to an over large room and there's just 12 zombies arranged in a neat row

359
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:30,300
because I guess the people in this room were doing the fucking hokey cokey when the aliens invaded.

360
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:33,100
I've never been so happy to see the ending screen of a video game,

361
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:37,580
and about the only positive takeaway I can see from this whole thing is that I'll never have to play it again.

362
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:41,260
And hopefully this video will serve as a warning to other Sunny Gems thinking about picking it up.

363
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:43,260
Hunt down the refund indeed.

364
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:46,300
Uh-uh. No, no, no, no.

365
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:50,620
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

366
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:53,820
Uh-uh! Nuh-uh!

367
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:59,180
You do not deserve to use this map!

368
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:01,180
No!

369
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:04,300
Fuuuuuuuck!

370
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:17,260
Unfortunately not, it was as awful as possibly feared, maybe even worse,

371
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:23,140
with the most embarrassing aspect being the excess of bugs, which many would have hoped parts of the extended

372
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:28,900
deadline were set aside for. The game would regularly crash, cutscenes were missing, audio levels were skewed.

373
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:35,020
It was practically unplayable on release. It was so bad you wouldn't be unreasonable in thinking it was all one big

374
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:40,340
ruse to hoodwink fans out of their money, and it wasn't just the unintended errors that were noticeable either.

375
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:43,540
Why don't, why don't they have textures on their eyes?

376
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:45,220
Hello captain, captain.

377
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:52,420
Why are they all voiced by me? I don't, I don't like the, hey shut, shut the game off, shut the game off, put, put the plot out of the shot.

378
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:57,380
You can tell me to calm down, there's a gas leak that can blow half of us all the way to hell with a fucking match.

379
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:59,380
Remember, no weapons.

380
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,660
Wait a minute, I thought you said no weapons.

381
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:11,060
Yeah, some, some gas leak, am I right guys?

382
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:18,020
There was lack of competence exhibited in multiple technical areas, including storyline, map design, controls, visual textures,

383
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:25,780
scripting, audio mastering, and voice acting. My god, the voice acting. Two words, President Keemstar.

384
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:42,100
My fellow Americans, as your president and commander-in-chief, it is with a heavy heart that I'm informing you that we have made a strategic decision.

385
00:34:42,100 --> 00:35:08,500
They even changed the plot to what was shown in the trailer, the guy who was originally Gordon Freeman was now a masked man,

386
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:16,020
so the plot has even less relevance to the original Half-Life series, undermining a fair bit of the intrigue behind the premise.

387
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:22,580
I mean, I could go on, but it was a terrible game, and it was wholly rejected by the community and casuals alike.

388
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:27,460
You didn't need to be a gaming connoisseur to recognize the absence of quality.

389
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:33,620
Royal Rudeus would make a few more posts responding to the issues present in their title, implementing a day one patch,

390
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:38,180
which allegedly fixed the in-game glitches, though many reviewers disputed this.

391
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:46,820
However, outrage didn't just end at the audience, with some members of the development team clearly upset by the hackneyed job carried out by RRE,

392
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:51,300
how their work was treated by the direction team, and more specifically, Birkin.

393
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:58,100
An interview with Kotaku, the head of PR, gave Sumner a claim that the wrong version of the game had been uploaded to Steam,

394
00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:00,260
but others had their own explanations.

395
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:07,140
The most outspoken advocate on this issue was an individual by the name of Telby, he was the sound designer on Hunt Down the Freeman,

396
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:11,300
like many others, a facet of the game which wasn't met with glowing praise.

397
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:16,980
He was also the person who had previously aired his annoyance at the numerous delays, however, had defended the game,

398
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:21,020
and even elements of the management, in spite of his recent criticisms.

399
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:37,860
This time, that nuanced perspective was buried six feet under, with him ripping into Birkin and the management from practically every angle,

400
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:41,860
telling a story of narcissism and ineptitude of the highest order.

401
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:49,380
It frames our director in chief as a guy with far more confidence than his ability permitted, and this is pretty in line with previous portrayals,

402
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:56,180
but here it's been to a dramatic detriment of the game, with many employees' work, like Telby's here, being completely compromised.

403
00:36:56,180 --> 00:37:05,380
Now, of course, this may be what a disgruntled employee says, but it fits in with Birkin's established reputation and would explain a lot of technical shortcomings.

404
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:14,020
Telby also alleges that many of the delays were publicity stunts, which once again may also explain why the game doesn't feel like it's been polished,

405
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:18,420
alongside some of the rather unconvincing excuses they put out in the past.

406
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:28,740
The creator of Hunt Down the Freeman, he acted upon that naivetivity, that naivetivity of thinking you could make a game like this and actually pull together investors and people and developers to work on it.

407
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:40,020
So all it really is is just an overestimation, an overextension of what one can meet his own goals with, and it created an interesting result, and I think it's something to take note of.

408
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:47,140
Another more emotionally reasoned insider response was that from a guy by the name of Dreadile, who had also worked on the game, contributing to some of the sound design as well.

409
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:57,460
God bless him, Birkin had an idea, and he tried to bring it to life. It doesn't always hit the mark, and there was a lot of external forces at play, I'm sure, both with investors and who knows what,

410
00:37:57,460 --> 00:38:06,020
but there still is a respect there for someone trying to create something and then also still getting to the point of releasing it, which most people don't even get to.

411
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:12,100
He had kind of worse to say about Birkin on a personal level, however also sincere concern to express given the state of the product.

412
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:18,900
When the customer's happy, the game makes money, you're able to pay off investors and etcetera, and they've come out and said that they have investors.

413
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:28,420
This game is not going to sell. It launched broken. It launched unplayable. This game is unplayable, and I'll talk a tiny bit about it as we go forward, but I'm actually a little scared for it.

414
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:33,940
I think that they might be in some serious trouble right now, like money wise, potentially, if they can't get these issues resolved.

415
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:41,860
Alongside that, he had seen criticism to bestow unto the creators behind the doomed enterprise, exposing the incompetence exhibited during much of the process.

416
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:47,220
There are a couple of things that keep you grounded when working on a game. One of them is a game design document.

417
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:54,900
Now, when I was approached to work on Hunt Down the Freeman a year and a half ago, Birkin was pitching me on the game and I didn't really understand what he was talking about.

418
00:38:54,900 --> 00:39:01,780
It didn't make too much sense to me in my head. I was just kind of going, yeah, yeah, yeah. And I had this weird feeling about everything.

419
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:08,820
Felt like something was not right. So when he was asking me to do some work for it, I was pretty adamant about getting the game design document.

420
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:20,500
And I will tell you that there was no game design document. All the ideas sort of came from the head of the creator with minimal, minimal, minimal scripting work done, I'm sure.

421
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:37,540
And so it reflects as such when you have 60 independent contractors all working for you and you have them each do once one piece without even knowing what it's going to contribute to the overall consistency and congeniality of the story.

422
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:40,260
You get a clusterfuck, you get this.

423
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:48,980
To be fair, he imparted some firm but pretty fair advice, still wishing the team the best, but also hoping they would act in the interest of those who had offered their money and time to the game.

424
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:57,060
There is only one way. That is to one, take down the game from Steam. It is unfortunately an unfinished game and a very poorly designed game.

425
00:39:57,060 --> 00:40:03,780
And if you want to create a product of value, you're going to have to take this down and completely redesign it. It just is not up to scratch.

426
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:19,620
Issue a statement with 100% honesty about the shortcomings, both with communication within the team and outside of the team, you know, to the community, and then spend a solid two years of hard development in order to get this game up to any kind of presentable state to the point where it's playable.

427
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:33,540
And at that point, you still probably might have a 10% chance of success. I mean, the damage is kind of already done, both to the reputation of the company, Rorudius Entertainment, and to the game itself, which has very negative reviews right now.

428
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:46,540
Would Birkin heed these words of wisdom? Well, not too long after, Birkin would make a post on the Steam page. I mean, it's signed RRE team, but I'm 99% sure it's Birkin, mainly because of how defensive it is.

429
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:57,540
Basically, the post claimed that towards the end of development, the team were hounded by false allegations from those within the community, which pressured them into pushing through production and releasing the unfinished game.

430
00:40:57,540 --> 00:41:05,780
Turns out, this only escalated the persecution they were facing, and this has upset them a lot, as no one has even asked them for their side.

431
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:16,220
This community is just concerned with drama, drama, drama, drama, disgusting. However, in spite of all this, they were committed to working on the game and continuing to improve it.

432
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:26,020
That's what this says about their character. They wanted to repair that lost trust. However, before they had the chance to do that, they were to be hunted down themselves.

433
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:38,540
That's it. I've been watching you all day, and all you do is play, play, play. I'm shutting all of this down right now.

434
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:53,540
You hear that over there? Yeah, they're very faint at this point in the story. You can barely hear them. That's because I'm a moron, and I don't see the biggest warning signs coming from a mile away.

435
00:41:53,540 --> 00:42:01,540
The call also sent me a thing like, every word equals this much money. Want your payment? I was like, I don't want your fucking payment.

436
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:10,540
What was it? You didn't take it? It allegedly uses assets stolen from the Garry's Mod workshop. It told Birkin, I was like, please delay this. Please delay this. Several months.

437
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:26,540
I haven't actually been paid as of now, so. I gotta just explain this to people. What it was like working on it. How much of a disaster it has turned out to be.

438
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:41,540
People don't tend to hold mods or fan made spin-offs to unreasonable standards. We're all aware that studios have a greater capacity to manufacture high production value content.

439
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:50,540
At the same time, we're also aware that funding doesn't solely dictate the quality of a game. There are many great indie games that were built off the back of budgets most moderate.

440
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:57,540
With this in mind, the indie developers who tend to succeed in this area are the ones who are aware of the limitations that such financial constraints may bring,

441
00:42:57,540 --> 00:43:06,540
and have the ability to work with mine to their pecuniary blueprint. Birkin was clearly not one for limitations, and his grasp far exceeded his reach.

442
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:15,540
The amount of money he was working with was still well below that of a proper corporate fund adventure, yet it was constantly hailed as the magnum opus of this budding businessman.

443
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:23,540
In this context, many considered him to be the Tommy Wiseau of gaming, attempting to create something that his ability clearly didn't enable him to.

444
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:34,540
Now, there are a lot of parallels that can be drawn to Tommy Wiseau and The Room in this intriguing tale. However, one of the stark differences that I would draw is that The Room is entertaining in its dreadfulness,

445
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:43,540
and Hunt Down the Freeman is considered by many to be painstakingly boring. Most people consider the cutscenes to be the most entertaining inclusion,

446
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:50,540
however, even then, it's just immensely cliched lines that will have you uprooting all the delicate follicles on your beautiful, beautiful scalp.

447
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:55,540
Your name. Who are you?

448
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:57,540
Mitchell.

449
00:43:57,540 --> 00:43:59,540
Mitchell, huh?

450
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:04,540
Yes, Mitchell. A name with many meanings.

451
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:12,540
For some, the meaning is a gift from God. For others, who is like God?

452
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:18,540
Which one are you, Mitchell? Are you a gift from God sent to save us?

453
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:24,540
Or perhaps you are God himself come to doom our worthless lives?

454
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:25,540
Perhaps.

455
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:27,540
He's cursed.

456
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:30,540
I always saw you as a hero after that day.

457
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:38,540
Hero? You're talking to a villain, my dear. The hero inside of me died many, many years ago when I was young.

458
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:44,540
The Room obtained its status by proxy of its own merit, even if that merit was its own catastrophe.

459
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:50,540
In comparison, Hunt Down the Freeman Millie used the fame of its YouTuber cast and employed a cunning marketing strategy,

460
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:56,540
which built hype within fan bases and managed to overcome any vocal descent from communities intimate to the series.

461
00:44:56,540 --> 00:45:02,540
Nonetheless, you can hype up the pudding all you want. The proof will always be in the eating.

462
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:08,540
Therefore, although the game was released to more publicity than would be expected for a title of that stature,

463
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:12,540
it was similarly berated by almost anyone able to formulate an opinion online,

464
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:15,540
bringing into question those associated with the project.

465
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:19,540
As with Telby, there'll always be some finger pointing when a game drastically underperforms,

466
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:24,540
but this will typically amount to a lot of conflicting testimonies that don't leave the inner circle of those invested.

467
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:29,540
However, at the same time, by giving prominent roles to creators who had large platforms and media followings,

468
00:45:29,540 --> 00:45:33,540
Birkin ran the risk of being publicly implicated if the project went haywire,

469
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:38,540
particularly given these were not just any old YouTubers, but the fabled commentator.

470
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:41,540
Commentators can be quite concerned with their public image,

471
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:44,540
given that their narratives are often loaded with moral principles and beliefs,

472
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:49,540
and therefore, in light of this failure, a couple sought to explain their position on the game,

473
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:51,540
while also sharing their thoughts on its caliber.

474
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:56,540
When I was approached by a guy telling me that he was making a Half-Life mod and that I could voice act in it,

475
00:45:56,540 --> 00:46:00,540
I thought, hey, what could possibly go wrong? Hello, captain.

476
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:04,540
Stories told were pretty similar. People were invited onto the project,

477
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:10,540
they thought, why not, and subsequently regretted it, while observing all the amateurish direction exhibited by management.

478
00:46:10,540 --> 00:46:15,540
Basically, it crescendoed from little tiny alarm bells just in the distance.

479
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:19,540
Can you hear that way back there? Can you hear that over there?

480
00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:24,540
Yeah, they're very faint at this point in the story. You can barely hear them.

481
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:29,540
That's because I'm a moron and I don't see the biggest warning signs coming from a mile away.

482
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:39,540
From the get-go, I had to sign a contract, which was a Gmail, or like an email,

483
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:46,540
with the details of the contract within the email, and signing it was replying to the email with my name.

484
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:50,540
The most informative video on this saga is the upload by I Hate Everything,

485
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:53,540
who documents some of the rather dodgy practices employed by Birkin,

486
00:46:53,540 --> 00:46:57,540
including out of context lines to be recorded that were sent over Skype,

487
00:46:57,540 --> 00:47:00,540
and a contract that was validated by replying with the person's name.

488
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:08,540
So my character was Asian, and at first, they were also supposed to be American, have an American accent.

489
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:12,540
So an American Asian. So the alarm bell's getting louder.

490
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:20,540
You do realize I'm English, right? I have a very, very noticeable English accent.

491
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:24,540
He was convinced I could do it, so I tried it for him.

492
00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:30,540
With none of this direction or context, I did the lines that I was given in this American accent.

493
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:34,540
Then weeks go by and I get some feedback.

494
00:47:34,540 --> 00:47:40,540
Yeah, we don't want to do the American accent anymore. Just do whatever you want, pretty much.

495
00:47:40,540 --> 00:47:44,540
And I'm like, oh, okay, then I'll just be English then. It's a lot easier for me.

496
00:47:44,540 --> 00:47:48,540
So then when it comes to the final product, and I'm skipping through the cutscenes,

497
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:57,540
like, what is this? And I find both the American and the English lines are in it.

498
00:47:57,540 --> 00:48:01,540
Do what the hell you gotta do, but I'm not going to be a part of this.

499
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:05,540
However, regardless of who was talking about it, the consensus was the same,

500
00:48:05,540 --> 00:48:10,540
that Birkin was in way over his head, and that he did not harness the creative skills to bring together such a vision.

501
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:14,540
And on top of the fact you're hiring YouTubers as voice actors,

502
00:48:14,540 --> 00:48:24,540
expecting this melancholy, overdramatic, dark, edgy drama kind of thing, kind of tone,

503
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:32,540
very serious tone that requires A, good writing and B, good actors to perform said writing.

504
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:36,540
The two biggest pillars are already, they've already collapsed.

505
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:40,540
And I don't know how that kind of oversight can be overlooked.

506
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:45,540
Unfortunately, in spite of the defiant steam post, Birkin had the cast stacked against him.

507
00:48:45,540 --> 00:48:49,540
It is, of course, very easy in these circumstances to blame the guy at the top,

508
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:52,540
and I'm sure there were oversights which went beyond his responsibility.

509
00:48:52,540 --> 00:48:57,540
But ultimately, when you credit yourself as the creator, writer, producer, director,

510
00:48:57,540 --> 00:49:03,540
and refer to it as a Birkin-Denise Aaron game, then you have to accept that at least some of the buck is going to stop at you.

511
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:09,540
False hope. I know the director. I mean, I told him I was making this video.

512
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:16,540
I was like, man, I got to just explain this to people, what it was like working on it,

513
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:22,540
how much of a disaster it has turned out to be, because it just seems weird otherwise.

514
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:27,540
Like, people are seeing or hearing my voice in this game, and they're like, wait, is that?

515
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:32,540
I'm like, what is he doing in this? I hate this game. I don't want to hear that.

516
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:38,540
And he was adamant that the game, it was the wrong version that released,

517
00:49:38,540 --> 00:49:44,540
and it was a broken version, and they have a better version that should have gone up,

518
00:49:44,540 --> 00:49:50,540
and I'm just like, well, that's even worse to do that.

519
00:49:50,540 --> 00:49:54,540
That's even more of an unprofessional move.

520
00:49:54,540 --> 00:49:58,540
Birkin had reached out to creators, begging them to hold off their videos,

521
00:49:58,540 --> 00:50:01,540
with the pledge that the game would be fixed as soon as possible.

522
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:05,540
But unfortunately, given that many of the changes he had already promised were not in place,

523
00:50:05,540 --> 00:50:09,540
there was little trust in his word, and those were the people he actually had contact with.

524
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:13,540
In the coming weeks, and even months, plenty of outsiders lined up,

525
00:50:13,540 --> 00:50:16,540
raring to rag on the game for the reputation it had acquired,

526
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:19,540
and using the information posted by his critics.

527
00:50:19,540 --> 00:50:22,540
The YouTube connection may have aided its marketing at first,

528
00:50:22,540 --> 00:50:24,540
and there was no denying the attention it was receiving,

529
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:29,540
but if Birkin was hoping to become the darling of the gamer world, he was gravely mistaken.

530
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:32,540
Initially, when I was making this video, I gave the developers fair warning,

531
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:35,540
and in response, they told me to not make this video,

532
00:50:35,540 --> 00:50:38,540
because they're bringing out a patch that would fix everything.

533
00:50:38,540 --> 00:50:43,540
He said it would drop, let's see, oh yeah, four fucking days ago.

534
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:47,540
I don't think these guys are scam artists, I just don't think they're artists at all.

535
00:50:47,540 --> 00:50:50,540
The consensus was clear, the creator burdened the blame,

536
00:50:50,540 --> 00:50:54,540
and after further updates, in one final attempt to curb the criticism,

537
00:50:54,540 --> 00:50:56,540
Birkin cut the steam price of the game.

538
00:50:56,540 --> 00:51:00,540
In many ways, in spite of the sheer incompetence and the publicity it spawned,

539
00:51:00,540 --> 00:51:04,540
Birkin appeared to care greatly about what people actually thought of the product,

540
00:51:04,540 --> 00:51:07,540
and even with its reputation thoroughly dragged through the mud,

541
00:51:07,540 --> 00:51:10,540
was attempting to find some sort of path back to redemption.

542
00:51:10,540 --> 00:51:14,540
Many acknowledged this, and even with the number of people bothered by the game,

543
00:51:14,540 --> 00:51:17,540
most creators tended to mitigate their criticism towards Birkin,

544
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:21,540
playing down the idea that he had acted maliciously in any capacity.

545
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:23,540
I can't say for certain in reading stories from the inside,

546
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:26,540
and watching one interview filmed just before the playable demo's release,

547
00:51:26,540 --> 00:51:31,540
whether Birkin Denizarian, the game's director and writer, is malicious or incompetent.

548
00:51:31,540 --> 00:51:35,540
So many people I work with on this progress,

549
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:40,540
only a couple people know the real, real concept of the game,

550
00:51:40,540 --> 00:51:44,540
because I didn't know who I can trust and who I can't.

551
00:51:44,540 --> 00:51:47,540
And I don't really like to bring it forward.

552
00:51:47,540 --> 00:51:51,540
One of the posts I will link to in the description states that they don't want things to get incendiary.

553
00:51:52,540 --> 00:51:55,540
So I'm leaning to saying that it's a case of stupidity rather than cruelty,

554
00:51:55,540 --> 00:51:58,540
if only because I like to believe that in people.

555
00:51:58,540 --> 00:52:00,540
However, not everyone subscribed to this point of view,

556
00:52:00,540 --> 00:52:04,540
stating that some details were simply not excusable by ignorance.

557
00:52:04,540 --> 00:52:06,540
What do these details entail?

558
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:08,540
Well, let's go there now.

559
00:52:11,540 --> 00:52:15,540
And I'm just looking at it, thinking,

560
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:19,540
Oh, you poor man. He's so nice. He's very nice, man.

561
00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:22,540
Just wanted to make a game, just wanted to make a fun game for people to enjoy.

562
00:52:37,540 --> 00:52:43,540
Poor old Birkin. All he wanted to do was bring a game to life for the adoring devotees.

563
00:52:43,540 --> 00:52:45,540
He's alive!

564
00:52:45,540 --> 00:52:49,540
And sure, maybe he didn't quite have the ability to fully realise his vision.

565
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:53,540
He still had the noblest of intentions, correct?

566
00:52:53,540 --> 00:52:57,540
Well, some would disagree, instead arguing that Birkin was a cynical charlatan,

567
00:52:57,540 --> 00:53:01,540
seeking to capitalise off a community's nostalgia for a revered franchise.

568
00:53:01,540 --> 00:53:03,540
How would one prove this?

569
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:07,540
Well, it's difficult to prove intent beyond a shadow of a doubt,

570
00:53:07,540 --> 00:53:11,540
and most people here clearly worked from the assumption that Birkin was not acting with malice,

571
00:53:11,540 --> 00:53:13,540
which is completely valid.

572
00:53:13,540 --> 00:53:18,540
However, if a person perpetrates various shady deeds with awareness of the possible consequences,

573
00:53:18,540 --> 00:53:22,540
then many would argue that they'd lose the benefit of the doubt we would typically grant them.

574
00:53:22,540 --> 00:53:24,540
This was the case some argued for Birkin.

575
00:53:24,540 --> 00:53:29,540
Now, producing and publishing a subpar game isn't sufficient evidence of a crooked character.

576
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:32,540
His bumbling approach can explain a lot of failures,

577
00:53:32,540 --> 00:53:35,540
but some felt that certain actions had crossed a line.

578
00:53:35,540 --> 00:53:39,540
Some felt that Birkin must have known how awful his game was before release,

579
00:53:39,540 --> 00:53:43,540
and pushed on with it in the pursuit of dollar, regardless of the cost.

580
00:53:43,540 --> 00:53:45,540
What would make people think that?

581
00:53:45,540 --> 00:53:48,540
Well, first of all, let's go back to Steam Greenlight,

582
00:53:48,540 --> 00:53:52,540
the former system to help indie developers release their game on the corresponding platform.

583
00:53:52,540 --> 00:53:54,540
In spite of some success stories,

584
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:59,540
there were also flaws which had made it pretty unpopular with a fair few from the gaming community,

585
00:53:59,540 --> 00:54:04,540
one of these being how easy it was for some bad actors to take advantage of the voting system,

586
00:54:04,540 --> 00:54:06,540
and the rather unscrupulous standards in place.

587
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:10,540
For example, you could implement bots to simulate the impression of more support

588
00:54:10,540 --> 00:54:13,540
than you were actually receiving, thus inflating your vote count

589
00:54:13,540 --> 00:54:15,540
and the possibility that your game would be approved.

590
00:54:15,540 --> 00:54:19,540
This is what some claimed that the team behind the game were attempting to carry out.

591
00:54:19,540 --> 00:54:24,540
In an archived link, numerous bots ascribed to the site csgo-happy.ru

592
00:54:24,540 --> 00:54:27,540
are listed as members of the game's Greenlight page,

593
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:30,540
implying that they had been bought by the team's management

594
00:54:30,540 --> 00:54:35,540
and used to inflate Hunt Down the Freeman's support, rather than earning it on its own merits.

595
00:54:35,540 --> 00:54:41,540
Now, Greenlight itself was discontinued in 2017, and replaced with a new system known as Steam Direct.

596
00:54:41,540 --> 00:54:45,540
Therefore, if this was the case, it would have likely happened in 2016

597
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:49,540
when they were attempting to cultivate publicity for their unsuccessful crowdfunding project.

598
00:54:49,540 --> 00:54:52,540
Nearly all these bots have since disappeared from the page,

599
00:54:52,540 --> 00:54:55,540
but their significance remains, as some concluded their presence

600
00:54:55,540 --> 00:54:58,540
was indicative of the campaign that Birkin was attempting to run.

601
00:54:58,540 --> 00:55:02,540
Another prominent controversy is relating to the use of their assets.

602
00:55:02,540 --> 00:55:06,540
Now, we've already discussed the unlicensed use of certain content in their 2016 demo,

603
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:11,540
and Royal Rudeus' rather futile attempts to distance themselves from that controversy,

604
00:55:11,540 --> 00:55:14,540
as well as their supposed vindication from other development teams.

605
00:55:14,540 --> 00:55:19,540
However, many contested that these dodgy dealings were still present in the official release,

606
00:55:19,540 --> 00:55:24,540
with one user going as far as to write up a whole list of all the alleged stolen assets used in the game.

607
00:55:24,540 --> 00:55:28,540
Once again, if true, it would show a conscious disregard for the profession,

608
00:55:28,540 --> 00:55:32,540
and other creators who work in the field, with little care as to what went into the game.

609
00:55:32,540 --> 00:55:36,540
It would also contradict the public statements that had been issued previously,

610
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:41,540
signifying additional dishonesty, and paying further credence into these cynical theories.

611
00:55:41,540 --> 00:55:44,540
To supplement this, it was also claimed that when brought up,

612
00:55:44,540 --> 00:55:47,540
people were being banned from the hunt down the Freeman Steam forums,

613
00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:52,540
with one user sharing an image in which he left a pretty harsh comment, and being banned for slander.

614
00:55:52,540 --> 00:55:55,540
Now, the comment was strong in its sentiments, but it's not slander,

615
00:55:55,540 --> 00:55:59,540
because as any culture's Spider-Man fan knows, in print, it's libel.

616
00:55:59,540 --> 00:56:02,540
Anyway, with that in mind, it's not really libelous either,

617
00:56:02,540 --> 00:56:08,540
the only possibly dubious comment is the claim that the developers have admitted that it's a cash grab themselves,

618
00:56:08,540 --> 00:56:10,540
something which I don't believe Birkin has done.

619
00:56:10,540 --> 00:56:16,540
Even then, they'd have to prove that some guy in a Steam forum trash-talking has damaged their reputation,

620
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:18,540
and I really don't think they needed any help with that.

621
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:23,540
So with these in mind, some began to draw the conclusion that Birkin wasn't just some sincere fool,

622
00:56:23,540 --> 00:56:29,540
but someone much more destructive and rapacious, with no concern for who he affected in the quest for success,

623
00:56:29,540 --> 00:56:31,540
including many of those he worked with.

624
00:56:31,540 --> 00:56:35,540
However, these allegations weren't exactly an open and shut case either.

625
00:56:35,540 --> 00:56:40,540
When it came to the stolen assets debacle, a pretty thorough response was published onto the hunt down the Freeman forums,

626
00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:44,540
going through each individual claim, either appearing to disprove the original poster,

627
00:56:44,540 --> 00:56:47,540
or placing the burden of proof back onto them.

628
00:56:47,540 --> 00:56:50,540
Although the dispute intercepts that much of the use in this game is lazy,

629
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:55,540
they assert that the developers likely had a license to use most of these assets in the official title,

630
00:56:55,540 --> 00:57:01,540
and in spite of the fact that there probably was illicitly acquired content in the 2016 demo,

631
00:57:01,540 --> 00:57:04,540
it couldn't really be attributed to them as it's a separate company.

632
00:57:04,540 --> 00:57:10,540
Now, as noted, I don't entirely agree with this, and think that accountability can be extended to previous projects,

633
00:57:10,540 --> 00:57:13,540
where there has been consistent involvement of certain individuals,

634
00:57:13,540 --> 00:57:17,540
but I also don't think it's the biggest deal if they have changed their ways,

635
00:57:17,540 --> 00:57:21,540
and although that's debatable, many didn't think it was fair to consider the assets stolen.

636
00:57:21,540 --> 00:57:24,540
This was echoed in Gabe Sumner's response to another post,

637
00:57:24,540 --> 00:57:28,540
where he also appears frustrated at the continued resurfacing of this claim.

638
00:57:28,540 --> 00:57:32,540
He also repudiates the notion that bots were used in the green light system,

639
00:57:32,540 --> 00:57:34,540
saying that it was probably someone trying to set them up.

640
00:57:34,540 --> 00:57:40,540
I'm not entirely sure what stake a person would have in buying bots for the hunt down the Freeman green light page,

641
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:46,540
but people have done stranger things to set others up, so I suppose it's not impossible, though somewhat suspicious.

642
00:57:46,540 --> 00:57:53,540
In fact, according to Gabe, the only illegal thing that RRE has done is not pay him, and other employees as well,

643
00:57:53,540 --> 00:57:55,540
but other than that, we're all good.

644
00:57:55,540 --> 00:57:58,540
Wait, what?

645
00:57:58,540 --> 00:58:02,540
I must admit, I am somewhat surprised by the nonchalance of such remark,

646
00:58:02,540 --> 00:58:07,540
but it seems these grievances could never impact a lot of the personnel's commitment to the game,

647
00:58:07,540 --> 00:58:09,540
and even its tainted honour.

648
00:58:09,540 --> 00:58:12,540
I do hold a mild level of admiration for that,

649
00:58:12,540 --> 00:58:15,540
but it's hard to ignore a lot of the criticisms that people raised,

650
00:58:15,540 --> 00:58:19,540
at the same time, with all the opinions of those actually involved in the game,

651
00:58:19,540 --> 00:58:24,540
almost all of them seemed hesitant to say that the project or its director were ill-natured.

652
00:58:24,540 --> 00:58:27,540
So what can be said about it?

653
00:58:27,540 --> 00:58:42,540
There is a story here, and a man at the centre of it.

654
00:58:42,540 --> 00:58:45,540
You see, while all the YouTubers and reviewers ragged on the game,

655
00:58:45,540 --> 00:58:49,540
obliterating its fragile reputation in front of the braying public,

656
00:58:49,540 --> 00:58:53,540
with those associated scrambling to salvage their personal investments,

657
00:58:53,540 --> 00:58:56,540
a certain individual had gone surprisingly quiet,

658
00:58:56,540 --> 00:58:58,540
Birken de Niziaren.

659
00:58:58,540 --> 00:59:01,540
Like, voice acting is not really cheap.

660
00:59:01,540 --> 00:59:03,540
I understand that.

661
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:08,540
Yeah, and I don't want a voice that, you know,

662
00:59:08,540 --> 00:59:13,540
I played some modes, and there was voices that the programmers and level designers did,

663
00:59:13,540 --> 00:59:16,540
and, I mean, it's okay, but, you know.

664
00:59:16,540 --> 00:59:18,540
You want the best, I understand that.

665
00:59:18,540 --> 00:59:20,540
I want it to be perfect.

666
00:59:20,540 --> 00:59:27,540
In a rather angry Steam post, the Half-Life YouTuber Bolloxed claimed to have invested $50,000 in this venture,

667
00:59:27,540 --> 00:59:32,540
which would at least explain the rather strange comments of support during the promotional operation.

668
00:59:32,540 --> 00:59:37,540
This was, however, disputed by Gabe, and looking at her positive comments, they do seem pretty ironic,

669
00:59:37,540 --> 00:59:41,540
though, once again, I'm not really sure of the point of all this,

670
00:59:41,540 --> 00:59:45,540
but it's a weird subplot that reflects the landscape.

671
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:49,540
In the server, some members of the team converged, waited, and vented,

672
00:59:49,540 --> 00:59:53,540
by the lack of game revisions and communications on Birken's part.

673
00:59:53,540 --> 00:59:56,540
Maybe it was out of shock, maybe it was out of embarrassment,

674
00:59:56,540 --> 01:00:01,540
maybe he'd come to the realisation there was little he could do to repair so much of the damage inflicted.

675
01:00:01,540 --> 01:00:05,540
At this point, Birken's world was only as good as his actions.

676
01:00:05,540 --> 01:00:09,540
If you look at the evidence, and accordingly compile a list of his errors slash misdeeds,

677
01:00:09,540 --> 01:00:12,540
it begins to look quite damning for our Turkish friend.

678
01:00:12,540 --> 01:00:16,540
Under his administration, people's work was misused or discarded.

679
01:00:16,540 --> 01:00:19,540
The organisation was on par with Tarnacon.

680
01:00:19,540 --> 01:00:22,540
His contributions in the script and direction were abysmal,

681
01:00:22,540 --> 01:00:25,540
the release was botched, and he continuously promised patches and updates,

682
01:00:25,540 --> 01:00:28,540
many of which people felt he didn't deliver.

683
01:00:28,540 --> 01:00:32,540
I don't know if it's been sorted out since, but some people weren't paid,

684
01:00:32,540 --> 01:00:35,540
and many felt ignored and mismanaged.

685
01:00:35,540 --> 01:00:40,540
In hindsight, this shouldn't be a surprise given how underqualified Birken was.

686
01:00:40,540 --> 01:00:44,540
Love him or hate him, he didn't have a clue on how to put a game together.

687
01:00:44,540 --> 01:00:49,540
Now, I think it'd be fair to conclude that in spite of the copious number of issues you could raise with his conduct,

688
01:00:49,540 --> 01:00:55,540
that he hadn't acted out of avarice or malice, in part because so many people who worked with him defended his character,

689
01:00:55,540 --> 01:01:00,540
and also because this would be one hell of a project to carry out just to make a quick buck,

690
01:01:00,540 --> 01:01:03,540
especially considering how you have to also pay Valve.

691
01:01:03,540 --> 01:01:07,540
I do think that Birken's will to accomplish his vision was at the expense of common sense,

692
01:01:07,540 --> 01:01:10,540
and subsequently those who fell victim to the reality.

693
01:01:10,540 --> 01:01:12,540
Many of them were upset with how their work was treated,

694
01:01:12,540 --> 01:01:15,540
many were harmed by the backlash of the game in general,

695
01:01:15,540 --> 01:01:17,540
many felt their reputation was on the line,

696
01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:22,540
and while Birken gave the workforce and the audience very little to appease the situation,

697
01:01:22,540 --> 01:01:24,540
these wounds only deepened.

698
01:01:24,540 --> 01:01:28,540
People who seek to criticize him on this basis have pretty strong grounding,

699
01:01:28,540 --> 01:01:30,540
and you can't really defend it.

700
01:01:30,540 --> 01:01:32,540
Birken's team deserved better.

701
01:01:32,540 --> 01:01:35,540
However, Birken clearly wasn't just some talentless hack,

702
01:01:35,540 --> 01:01:38,540
and to frame him as such would be a discredit to those who believed in him.

703
01:01:39,540 --> 01:01:43,540
Yes, Birken clearly didn't possess the skills to turn out a high quality game,

704
01:01:43,540 --> 01:01:48,540
but as noted, this should have been quite obvious when you look at the facts from a detached perspective.

705
01:01:48,540 --> 01:01:51,540
When put to the practical test, this was continuously exposed,

706
01:01:51,540 --> 01:01:55,540
the initial demo was rejected unanimously by fans with the series.

707
01:01:55,540 --> 01:02:00,540
Need I remind you, he raised $12 while courting for support of his concept.

708
01:02:00,540 --> 01:02:03,540
Virtually every preview was beset by multiple faults,

709
01:02:03,540 --> 01:02:08,540
and his attitudes towards workplace professionalism would probably raise a few eyebrows to say the least.

710
01:02:08,540 --> 01:02:12,540
However, in spite of all this, he managed to assemble a team of over 60 people,

711
01:02:12,540 --> 01:02:15,540
raise enough money to buy the necessary licenses,

712
01:02:15,540 --> 01:02:22,540
create and market a game by presenting others with a vision that persuaded them to give up their valuable time and money.

713
01:02:22,540 --> 01:02:26,540
He was essentially selling tickets to the Hindenburg after it had crashed,

714
01:02:26,540 --> 01:02:29,540
and it all came down to one thing, belief.

715
01:02:29,540 --> 01:02:33,540
It's by virtue of the fact that Birken had so little going for him on a technical level,

716
01:02:33,540 --> 01:02:38,540
which is a testament to his skills as a salesperson with a project he seemed to legitimately believe in.

717
01:02:38,540 --> 01:02:43,540
He started from a losing position, and argued his way into a winning one.

718
01:02:43,540 --> 01:02:47,540
A good salesman can sell a good product, a great salesman can sell a bad one.

719
01:02:47,540 --> 01:02:51,540
Whether that's justifiable amount of money is irrelevant.

720
01:02:51,540 --> 01:02:56,540
It doesn't matter whether it's 10k, 100k, or a million, nobody knows you,

721
01:02:56,540 --> 01:02:58,540
and I think that's one of the problems that people have got.

722
01:02:58,540 --> 01:03:01,540
But as you've already said, you're going to be releasing a mod now.

723
01:03:01,540 --> 01:03:07,540
Is that because of the kind of response you got from the community?

724
01:03:07,540 --> 01:03:14,540
Well, actually, I get the exact response I was thinking,

725
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:18,540
because some people love it, some people hate it,

726
01:03:18,540 --> 01:03:23,540
and these haters actually made the game more popular right now.

727
01:03:23,540 --> 01:03:29,540
Because hate is a fast way to make people know about it,

728
01:03:29,540 --> 01:03:31,540
because they just go around and tell everyone,

729
01:03:31,540 --> 01:03:38,540
hey, look, that dude made a Half-Life game, that's crazy, and it just makes it more popular.

730
01:03:38,540 --> 01:03:43,540
Facing the bombardment of Sencha, Birken was silent, probably for many reasons,

731
01:03:43,540 --> 01:03:46,540
most of them not positive, however, the truth remained,

732
01:03:46,540 --> 01:03:50,540
that Birken had probably done the best he could with his relative skillset,

733
01:03:50,540 --> 01:03:54,540
and in time, animosity fades, and your merits are noted.

734
01:03:54,540 --> 01:03:58,540
As much as Hunt Down the Freeman makes Birken accountable for its failure,

735
01:03:58,540 --> 01:04:02,540
his role as the driving force behind its inception is undeniable,

736
01:04:02,540 --> 01:04:06,540
and the credit his colleagues give him for his passion is also beyond doubt.

737
01:04:06,540 --> 01:04:09,540
It seems they weren't the only people who recognised this either,

738
01:04:09,540 --> 01:04:14,540
because in 2019, Birken was hired by Activision Blizzard as a production coordinator,

739
01:04:14,540 --> 01:04:17,540
with the company knowledgeable of his role in Hunt Down the Freeman.

740
01:04:17,540 --> 01:04:22,540
This announcement was met with shock from many, some still insistent that he wasn't fit for the job,

741
01:04:22,540 --> 01:04:26,540
others believing he had not atoned for his previous errors, such as payment,

742
01:04:26,540 --> 01:04:29,540
something which certain individuals claim is still outstanding.

743
01:04:29,540 --> 01:04:34,540
Nonetheless, that comes down to what those who actually worked on the project have to say,

744
01:04:34,540 --> 01:04:37,540
which right now isn't too much all in all.

745
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:41,540
With a few exceptions, I think many involved were almost embarrassed that they didn't know better,

746
01:04:41,540 --> 01:04:44,540
that they were won over by a dream rather than the reality,

747
01:04:45,540 --> 01:04:49,540
which is possibly why they were all so reluctant to lay into Birken's management,

748
01:04:49,540 --> 01:04:52,540
because they may have all felt somewhat complicit in that.

749
01:04:52,540 --> 01:04:54,540
With that said, Birken was a headstrong guy,

750
01:04:54,540 --> 01:04:59,540
and I think it would have taken more than a simple intervention to make him re-evaluate what he was creating.

751
01:04:59,540 --> 01:05:04,540
I believe that was shown up in the Steam post, where he basically blamed the haters for the resulting mess,

752
01:05:04,540 --> 01:05:08,540
because at that point, it was more than just a few people telling him it was a lost cause.

753
01:05:08,540 --> 01:05:13,540
In the Twitter replies of his announcement, he depicted Hunt Down the Freeman as a learning curve,

754
01:05:13,540 --> 01:05:16,540
which I think is fair, but it was also quite a costly one,

755
01:05:16,540 --> 01:05:21,540
and I hope he took any chances to clear the air with those he worked with and compensate where he could,

756
01:05:21,540 --> 01:05:25,540
because in spite of the mess it was, the game probably landed him his current job,

757
01:05:25,540 --> 01:05:30,540
and that was in part thanks to the fact that a lot of people who could have thrown him under the bus chose not to,

758
01:05:30,540 --> 01:05:34,540
and in all fairness, he didn't throw them under the bus either, and I respect that.

759
01:05:34,540 --> 01:05:38,540
However, whether colleagues have moved on to greener pastures or not,

760
01:05:39,540 --> 01:05:44,540
it will likely be a bittersweet experience for some, and just a bitter one for others.

761
01:05:44,540 --> 01:05:48,540
With this in mind, I think it's time to wrap up this tale for the ages.

762
01:05:48,540 --> 01:06:08,540
In many ways, it was true, Hunt Down the Freeman was an unmitigated disaster,

763
01:06:08,540 --> 01:06:13,540
yet at the same time, it was an unparalleled feat, it really shouldn't exist,

764
01:06:13,540 --> 01:06:16,540
and to be honest, people would probably be better off without it,

765
01:06:16,540 --> 01:06:21,540
but with what people were working with, the fact that the game happened at all is a borderline miracle,

766
01:06:21,540 --> 01:06:24,540
and I feel its failures have almost enlightened many in a way.

767
01:06:24,540 --> 01:06:30,540
The buyers, although inconvenient, were probably mildly entertained by the fever dream that such a game represented,

768
01:06:30,540 --> 01:06:33,540
while also being informed on bad financial decisions.

769
01:06:33,540 --> 01:06:38,540
The YouTuber's lives have since gone on, Colossal may have even uploaded a video since then,

770
01:06:38,540 --> 01:06:44,540
for them it's a funny, albeit slightly embarrassing story, no one really blames them for what was obviously bad casting,

771
01:06:44,540 --> 01:06:48,540
and I doubt it'll harm their career prospects if they ever wanted to dabble in acting again.

772
01:06:48,540 --> 01:06:52,540
The posse I feel most sympathy for is those who worked on the game,

773
01:06:52,540 --> 01:06:56,540
there are a lot of talented people who clearly felt that the title's representation of the work

774
01:06:56,540 --> 01:06:59,540
had distorted their efforts and besmirched their credentials.

775
01:06:59,540 --> 01:07:05,540
Add in the further issues that many of them complained about, I really wouldn't blame them for wanting to forget this dumpster fire.

776
01:07:05,540 --> 01:07:10,540
Nonetheless, hopefully enough time has elapsed and allowed those associated to find new opportunities.

777
01:07:10,540 --> 01:07:14,540
I guess the moral of the story is to ensure that even if a person talks a convincing game,

778
01:07:14,540 --> 01:07:18,540
that you sometimes have to look at their record to deliver on such commitments.

779
01:07:18,540 --> 01:07:22,540
The same advice can be passed to investors, whoever they are.

780
01:07:22,540 --> 01:07:28,540
Yet the man who had the most to learn was Birkin, but sometimes the best lesson is to know your limits.

781
01:07:28,540 --> 01:07:34,540
Birkin is clearly an enthusiastic guy with infectious energy, but that's not always enough,

782
01:07:34,540 --> 01:07:39,540
and he'd need to educate himself a bit if he ever wanted to enter the creative side of games production again.

783
01:07:39,540 --> 01:07:45,540
Hopefully his new position plays a bit more into his comfort zone while allowing him to pick up new skills along the way.

784
01:07:45,540 --> 01:07:51,540
Hunt Down the Freeman was a case of too much, too soon, but as a strange twist of fate,

785
01:07:51,540 --> 01:07:54,540
it worked out for him, and I hope he doesn't forget that.

786
01:07:54,540 --> 01:07:59,540
As mentioned, there are many similarities between The Room and Hunt Down the Freeman,

787
01:07:59,540 --> 01:08:04,540
particularly their respective architects, but Hunt Down the Freeman was unexceptional on paper,

788
01:08:04,540 --> 01:08:11,540
and most of the execution too, a substandard revenge shooter consisting of mostly mundane or repetitive gameplay,

789
01:08:11,540 --> 01:08:16,540
with somewhat cornerly written cutscenes spliced in between. It was destined to be a flash in the pan,

790
01:08:16,540 --> 01:08:23,540
but Birkin hyped it up in every way possible, with the YouTubers he brought in being front and centre over this elaborate plan.

791
01:08:23,540 --> 01:08:29,540
What he said to them, we may never know, but it quickly manifested itself into something greater.

792
01:08:29,540 --> 01:08:33,540
Incorporating famous names into your cast isn't some avant-garde strategy,

793
01:08:33,540 --> 01:08:37,540
but the inclusion of these creators just makes the experience all the more surreal,

794
01:08:37,540 --> 01:08:43,540
particularly commentators, many of whom are specifically known for their voices, it's hard to hear them as anyone else.

795
01:08:43,540 --> 01:08:46,540
The only YouTuber who should voice act at all, really, is me.

796
01:08:46,540 --> 01:08:48,540
Okay, what do you think?

797
01:08:48,540 --> 01:08:50,540
That's quite something.

798
01:08:50,540 --> 01:08:51,540
Come on!

799
01:08:51,540 --> 01:08:53,540
My clients will be very pleased.

800
01:08:53,540 --> 01:08:57,540
Okay, okay, okay. What do you say to 200k?

801
01:08:57,540 --> 01:09:04,540
That sounds acceptable. In fact, it's quite low. My rich buyer probably would have paid a lot more even.

802
01:09:04,540 --> 01:09:10,540
Fantastic! Yes! Hey! That's it!

803
01:09:10,540 --> 01:09:13,540
Okay, okay, I'm proud of it. Just leave me alone, I like it.

804
01:09:13,540 --> 01:09:17,540
Anyhow, the YouTube connection initiated a domino effect,

805
01:09:17,540 --> 01:09:21,540
inflating coverage with many people harping on its flagrant issues and meme potential,

806
01:09:21,540 --> 01:09:26,540
tarnishing yet immortalising its status within gaming and online cliques alike.

807
01:09:26,540 --> 01:09:32,540
In a way, it highlights how easily we are influenced sometimes, yet also highlights the strength of our own influence.

808
01:09:32,540 --> 01:09:36,540
At the end of the day, Hunt Down the Freeman certainly stuck in people's memories,

809
01:09:36,540 --> 01:09:39,540
you could go as far to say it has a pretty decent half-life.

810
01:09:40,540 --> 01:09:43,540
Oh, please spare me.

811
01:09:43,540 --> 01:09:48,540
Speaking of, there's a lot of questions as to what this means for the Half-Life series itself,

812
01:09:48,540 --> 01:09:54,540
and possibly other mods. I'd honestly say, not too much hopefully, though I do understand the concern.

813
01:09:54,540 --> 01:09:57,540
There was another Half-Life mod released a couple of years before Hunt Down the Freeman

814
01:09:57,540 --> 01:09:59,540
that received pretty mixed reviews from the community at the time.

815
01:09:59,540 --> 01:10:04,540
I think some were worried that it was outlining a pattern of people trying to haphazardly invent content

816
01:10:04,540 --> 01:10:06,540
to fill in gaps the previous games left.

817
01:10:06,540 --> 01:10:11,540
However, I think Hunt Down the Freeman's reputation as a bad game with YouTubers involved

818
01:10:11,540 --> 01:10:14,540
has superseded its reputation as a Half-Life spin-off.

819
01:10:14,540 --> 01:10:19,540
I can understand how it may make prospective developers more tentative to act on personal inspiration,

820
01:10:19,540 --> 01:10:23,540
but I don't think fans and gamers in general, who as noted at the start,

821
01:10:23,540 --> 01:10:27,540
probably welcome innovative projects, would be put off by this creation.

822
01:10:27,540 --> 01:10:31,540
I think it's a natural outcome with fan-made content, some of it's gonna be pretty good,

823
01:10:31,540 --> 01:10:34,540
and others will leave a bit to be desired.

824
01:10:34,540 --> 01:10:37,540
The difference with Hunt Down the Freeman was its scale, and with that,

825
01:10:37,540 --> 01:10:42,540
the game just transformed itself into a meme that transcends simple categorisation.

826
01:10:42,540 --> 01:10:47,540
At the centre of the story, a man who comparably rises above the realms of human understanding,

827
01:10:47,540 --> 01:10:52,540
embodying the purest form of dream-stimulated idealism, a driving force behind a vision.

828
01:10:52,540 --> 01:10:58,540
In spite of that vision's many imperfections, he made it happen, for better and for worse.

829
01:10:58,540 --> 01:11:01,540
Some may not acknowledge the true influence that he exhibited,

830
01:11:01,540 --> 01:11:05,540
but there is no way that this game would have existed without his presence.

831
01:11:05,540 --> 01:11:10,540
It seems quite improbable that the Hunt Down the Freeman franchise will bring us a sequel,

832
01:11:10,540 --> 01:11:13,540
and the developers have confirmed this also, many have moved on,

833
01:11:13,540 --> 01:11:16,540
and probably would be difficult to convince to return.

834
01:11:16,540 --> 01:11:20,540
There is a parody account that claims to be carrying the baton of the franchise forward,

835
01:11:20,540 --> 01:11:24,540
though I wouldn't hold my breath. Every now and then, the company Twitter will post a meme,

836
01:11:24,540 --> 01:11:29,540
or share an interaction, they even mention their community, which is an attainment in itself.

837
01:11:29,540 --> 01:11:34,540
I doubt there'll be many new updates, and it seems the team has embraced the meme status since,

838
01:11:34,540 --> 01:11:37,540
but if you really want to see where it is now, it's $8 on Steam,

839
01:11:37,540 --> 01:11:41,540
which may still be a bit overpriced, especially when you can buy Among Us,

840
01:11:41,540 --> 01:11:47,540
but it's your money. If you buy it after this video, and find out it's not the life-changing experience you'd hope for,

841
01:11:47,540 --> 01:11:49,540
then that may be on you.

842
01:11:49,540 --> 01:11:52,540
If you want to play a recently released critically acclaimed Half-Life game,

843
01:11:52,540 --> 01:11:57,540
and have the resources, then Half-Life Alyx came out this year for virtual reality consoles.

844
01:11:57,540 --> 01:12:00,540
It also covers events in between the first two games in the series,

845
01:12:00,540 --> 01:12:04,540
so clearly the developers must have been inspired by our good friend Birkin.

846
01:12:04,540 --> 01:12:08,540
I've expected Alyx to pop up in front of me, and save me from this shit game.

847
01:12:08,540 --> 01:12:12,540
It's hard to say exactly what Valve has in store for the Half-Life franchise,

848
01:12:12,540 --> 01:12:18,540
and with investment from many in its universe, it's natural that some want to offer their own contributions,

849
01:12:18,540 --> 01:12:22,540
but making a video game or a mod is more than just aspiration,

850
01:12:22,540 --> 01:12:25,540
it's about knowledge, ability, and experience,

851
01:12:25,540 --> 01:12:27,540
and filling your goals with mind to them.

852
01:12:27,540 --> 01:12:31,540
Equally, if it's just your mod, then have a blast, it's your life,

853
01:12:31,540 --> 01:12:34,540
but if you're going to involve other people, and make promises to them,

854
01:12:34,540 --> 01:12:36,540
remember what they're giving up as well,

855
01:12:36,540 --> 01:12:40,540
and do your best to honour it with your own talent and commitment.

856
01:12:40,540 --> 01:12:42,540
Otherwise, you may end up with this.

857
01:12:42,540 --> 01:12:46,540
And believe me, we will live to fight another day.

858
01:12:46,540 --> 01:12:49,540
We shall return.

859
01:12:49,540 --> 01:12:55,540
God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.

860
01:12:55,540 --> 01:12:58,540
Few things are certain in the story of Half-Life.

861
01:12:58,540 --> 01:13:01,540
However, there is one thing I can guarantee.

862
01:13:01,540 --> 01:13:05,540
That being, that I am a gamer.

863
01:13:05,540 --> 01:13:07,540
So stop doubting my credentials for fun-

864
01:13:07,540 --> 01:13:09,540
CLAP

865
01:13:09,540 --> 01:13:10,540
CLAP

866
01:13:10,540 --> 01:13:13,540
So yes, that was the video, I hope you enjoyed,

867
01:13:13,540 --> 01:13:16,540
I want to give a big thanks to my editors,

868
01:13:16,540 --> 01:13:19,540
who've done a fantastic job, thank you so much,

869
01:13:19,540 --> 01:13:22,540
I love you all a lot, really makes a difference

870
01:13:22,540 --> 01:13:25,540
when you have such reliable people working for you,

871
01:13:25,540 --> 01:13:28,540
thank you guys, they'll all be in the pinned comment,

872
01:13:28,540 --> 01:13:31,540
go and check them out, we support them, we support them.

873
01:13:31,540 --> 01:13:33,540
I suppose I have to mention my patrons,

874
01:13:33,540 --> 01:13:38,540
I want to give a big thanks to $10 patrons up on screen right now,

875
01:13:38,540 --> 01:13:40,540
I also have to thank my $50 patrons,

876
01:13:40,540 --> 01:13:45,540
we have Devan, Shirochigo, Amanda and Hypercube,

877
01:13:45,540 --> 01:13:49,540
Caroline and somehullablue, Tree and Poki-san,

878
01:13:49,540 --> 01:13:52,540
and the $100 patrons, Christopher Karas,

879
01:13:52,540 --> 01:13:56,540
such charming names, thank you so much guys,

880
01:13:56,540 --> 01:13:58,540
you really make a difference.

881
01:13:58,540 --> 01:14:00,540
Just thank you from the bottom of my heart.

882
01:14:00,540 --> 01:14:03,540
Hey, we're doing alright, we're almost at the end of 2020,

883
01:14:03,540 --> 01:14:07,540
it's almost over, we just gotta get through a couple,

884
01:14:07,540 --> 01:14:11,540
more hurdles, election, woo.

885
01:14:11,540 --> 01:14:15,540
It hasn't been the most fun for me personally at points,

886
01:14:15,540 --> 01:14:19,540
and obviously if you've been following my posts on Instagram

887
01:14:19,540 --> 01:14:21,540
or my YouTube community posts,

888
01:14:21,540 --> 01:14:23,540
you'll know that I've been having a few health issues,

889
01:14:23,540 --> 01:14:26,540
and I want to thank anyone who's sent me messages of support,

890
01:14:26,540 --> 01:14:30,540
it really makes a difference, and it keeps you going,

891
01:14:30,540 --> 01:14:32,540
it keeps you pushing forward, and that's what I plan to do,

892
01:14:32,540 --> 01:14:36,540
so thank you guys, and I hope everyone else is taking care of themselves

893
01:14:36,540 --> 01:14:40,540
too, and social medias, they'll be in the pinned comment,

894
01:14:40,540 --> 01:14:42,540
you know that by now, if you got this far at least.

895
01:14:42,540 --> 01:14:45,540
Okay guys, I'm gonna wrap this one up here,

896
01:14:45,540 --> 01:14:49,540
take care of yourselves, I'm The Right Opinion,

897
01:14:49,540 --> 01:14:52,540
and I'll see you in the next one.

898
01:15:06,540 --> 01:15:08,540
you
