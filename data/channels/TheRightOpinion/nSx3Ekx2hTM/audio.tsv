0	11760	Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with
11760	17760	too much free time, and recently I have been the recipient of shocking allegations, that
17760	24420	I am frankly, astounded, anyone would suggest. These are, of course, the allegations that
24420	31740	I am, in fact, not a gamer. I know my friends, I am as outraged as you are, once again,
31740	37680	the pineapple on pizza loving heathens have the audacity to cast doubt on my gamer credentials,
37680	42080	needless to say, I would be crying at the club if it was open. So, I guess I will have
42080	47520	to debunk these claims by taking on another gamer topic, one which will serve as indisputable
47520	51720	evidence for my unflinching gamer status. But first, let's talk about another curious
51720	54680	video game that serves as the backdrop for today's subject.
54680	73000	Half Life, it's a video game for gamers, like me, who wish to immerse themselves in
73000	76960	a first person shooter with a bit more depth, with the first being released in 1998, the
76960	82120	second in 2004, and further successive instalments being released in 2006 and 2007, as well
82120	85980	as some additional expansion packs in between. The first game focuses around an individual
85980	90040	by the name of Gordon Freeman, who like many people, triggers an alien invasion when an
90040	94120	experiment that he's running opens up a dimensional rift in time and space. Obviously, antics
94120	98860	ensue and he finds himself up against a diverse plethora of enemies in his mission to return
98860	103420	stability to this facility and the planet alike. Obviously, my synopsis of these games
103420	107060	will remain relatively short, so I don't spoil it for anyone planning to play it themselves,
107060	110940	but generally speaking, it's considered by many to be one of the greatest games ever
110940	114700	published, and this is the same story with its successor, Half Life 2, which follows
114700	119100	our good friend Gordon a couple decades on after the events of the first. It incorporates
119100	123040	many elements present in its predecessor, while adding new features and improving on
123040	127420	existing ones. In spite of their shooter status, the series was characterised by its heightened
127420	131620	sense of ambition, with Valve president Gabe Newell stating that if Half Life 2 isn't
131620	135740	viewed as the best PC game of all time, it's going to completely bum out most of the guys
135740	140820	on this team, but Gabe need not have feared. It was released to universal acclaim from
140820	145140	reviewers and audiences alike, and is also regarded as one of the greatest games of all
145140	150160	time. After the success of the first two games, the developers decided to further metamorphose
150160	154300	their approach, with the plan to release a trilogy of episodes, continuing the story
154300	158860	from the lens of our protagonist and a new non-player character by the name of Alex Vance,
158860	162540	a lovely young lady who was present in the previous game, who is now receiving a more
162540	166600	prominent role as a companion to Mr Freeman here. The first two episodes released a highly
166600	170460	positive reception, however, it wasn't quite equivalent to the rampant appraisal that the
170460	174660	previous games had received, though this did not appear to deter them. Episode 3 should
174660	179100	have completed this trilogy, and was planned for release in Christmas 2007, however was
179100	183500	initially postponed, and then cancelled following a sequence of delays and changes to company
183500	187500	trajectory. Since then, there has been a lot of speculation as to when the long anticipated
187500	191600	Half-Life 3 will be released, in fact, as I'm sure many of you know, there is an infamous
191600	196180	meme revolving around people's rather excitable nature to seek confirmation on the game's
196180	199780	announcement, indulged by many throughout the industry. On Wikipedia, there is a page
199780	204700	exclusively dedicated to documenting unreleased Half-Life games. It seems that in spite of
204700	208700	their revered status within gamer society, the hype surrounding prospective Half-Life
208700	213420	projects precedes them. The series had elevated itself to this cult level status, and wherever
213420	217480	there's a devoted fanbase, there's typically market potential. Combine this with the desire
217480	221660	for simply more Half-Life content, yet a significant lack of it in the decade following
221660	226240	the uncompleted trilogy, and people were longing for a saviour, holding out for a hero to give
226240	231080	them what they wanted. And from the darkness came an unlikely salvation, but was it the
231080	233680	one we needed, or the one we deserved?
233680	257200	This is Hunt Down The Freeman, it is a fan made spin-off game of Half-Life, released
257200	262360	in 2018. It's plot, unlike other Half-Life releases, follows the character Mitchell Shepherd,
262360	266120	a member from one of the groups hostile to Freeman in the first instalment, as he attempts
266120	270800	to track down and subsequently slay our hero. It is a revenge-themed first person shooter
270800	276480	developed and published by Royal Rudious Entertainment, who's CEO is Joe Connors. However, the credit
276480	282640	really must go to the director, producer, and writer, Birkin de Nizarin, who also goes
282640	287320	by the name of Frank, presumably because his full title is a bit of a mouthful. The game's
287320	292360	release was met with denunciation and opprobrium from all ends of the industry spectrum, alongside
292360	296000	controversy surrounding many aspects of the game's development. However, that does not
296000	300320	make it particularly exceptional in the grand scheme of things, many video games are embroiled
300320	304860	in their fair share of for all. So why are we here today? The devs thought it'd be a
304860	310280	great idea to ask a bunch of YouTubers to voice for the game, and somehow, I wasn't
310280	320200	the worst. You see, Hunt Down The Freeman ran a very interesting marketing strategy,
320200	325040	which included the decision to take the daring step in casting YouTubers amongst their ensemble.
325040	328960	Obviously, given YouTube's performative nature, this may have made sense on paper,
328960	331720	however, it didn't quite translate in practice.
331720	356000	Following the release, this led to a tidal wave of publicity, where castigation was fused
356000	361060	with a peculiar amusement and curiosity at how such a disaster piece came into being.
361060	365540	It became the target of critics and commentators alike, whose coverage enshrined the game's
365540	370380	status amongst audiences, causing many to wonder exactly how this happened.
370380	375280	Well, today my friends, I attempt to unpack that mystery, and the controversy surrounding
375280	380260	the most ambitious crossover in modern history. Comrades, I suggest we waste no more time
380260	386020	on idle chatter and cut into the meat of this juicy, juicy joint. Friends, let's hunt
386020	400060	down that Freeman. To understand the beginnings of this curious case, we should probably go back to 2016,
400060	405020	because as I'm sure you're aware, a game can often take many years to grow from its humble roots,
405020	410420	and Hunt Down The Freeman was no exception. Nonetheless, its origins are a bit of a mystery in a way,
410420	415340	because they begin with the man Birkin, hailing from the glorious Turkey, initially not particularly
415380	421340	proficient in English, although having active accounts only sprung into action in the latter half of the 2010s.
421340	427180	Not too much is known about him prior to then, the Tommy Wiseau of video games per se, and I'll tell you,
427180	432060	the similarities do not end there. When our good friend Birkin here had the idea for Hunt Down The Freeman,
432060	438100	he was motivated, he was driven, and he decided to assemble a crack team who could help bring his vision into fruition.
438100	443940	There was clear development going on behind the scenes in 2015. A tweet in August of that year has Birkin
443940	449260	announcing work on a new game, and although it's mostly quiet after that, we can pin the day that it was
449260	455660	officially announced to the 5th of July 2016, the day after American independence. People were going to be in
455660	461180	high spirits, and there was surely no better way to maintain this morale than to launch Hunt Down The Freeman's
461180	467420	IndieGoGo crowdfunding project. To garner further attention, it was also posted on Steam's Greenlight feature.
467420	472660	Greenlight is a now-retired system which allowed indie developers to pay a nominal fee to announce upcoming
472700	478500	projects, with users subsequently voting on their sentiments towards the game. In the IndieGoGo and Greenlight pages,
478500	483980	there were links to what we can assume was a trailer, some gameplay, and an interview that was posted a few days later,
483980	488820	accompanied by some screenshots. There is a version of the trailer still assessable on another channel,
488820	491300	which demonstrates the quality being displayed here.
491300	509300	When Hunt Down The Freeman's page was listed on Greenlight, the response could probably be evaluated as lukewarm at
509300	514580	best. The concept may have been interesting, but many people expressed reservations over various aspects of the
514580	520140	game, ranging from qualms with creative choices such as the cutscenes, an issue which I'll dissect in a bit, to
520140	526100	concerns encompassing the actual legality of such a game. Our good friend Birkin here was kind enough to open a Q&A
526100	531300	thread where he would discuss anybody's queries, however, almost immediately, he ended up in a rather obstinate
531300	536700	debate with a user over the liability of such a venture. They ask if our friend Frankie here has permission from
536700	542100	Valve to set up the game in the Half-Life universe, and he responds, stating that Valve lets people use their IP
542100	547940	source mods. The person then points out that he is marketing a standalone game, and Birkin responds with,
547940	555700	This back and forth continues until it is established that Hunt Down The Freeman is both a mod and a standalone game,
555700	560860	but this interaction would not have inspired faith in prospective investors. He was subsequently flooded by further
560860	566940	questions over the legality and soundness of the project in question, and shortly after, Birkin decided to make a post
566940	573420	addressing people's doubts. This post began by attempting to address misgivings surrounding the budget, as observed,
573420	578940	$100,000 was quite a lofty goal, and although that would be modest for many developments, people weren't exactly
578940	585260	expecting a AAA release here. However, it appears that there was a reason Birkin had expertly estimated the figure of
585260	591460	100 grand. You see, the trailer that we viewed was made with Half-Life 2 assets. The budget in question would allow
591460	597180	the developers to purchase their own assets, as well as licenses for the content. You see, Birkin didn't want this to
597180	604340	just be another mod, in his own words, he wanted it to be a professional game. Now, if you ignore the irony of
604340	610260	professional being spelled wrong, it is hard to deny that Birkin possessed a lot of ambition and faith in his idea,
610260	615620	and believed he could convince the audience that this was a worthwhile investment. He clearly believed it himself,
615620	621980	and he continued to advocate for it over the coming days in spite of the scoffers and the skeptics. He appeared to hold
621980	627340	that outlook that if you're dogged and persistent enough, then you could sell water to a drowning man. There was little
627340	633460	doubt about it, Birkin had confidence coming out of his ears. However, sales isn't just confidence, it's about having
633460	638620	knowledge of your product, and knowledge of the demographic you're going to be marketing it to, and first impressions
638620	644420	are a lot, so the fact that his post appeared uncertain on particular characteristics and technicalities of the game,
644420	650460	you did more questions than it did answers. One of the most acclaimed facets of the original Half-Life series were its
650460	655980	choice to diminish the use of cutscenes in favour of scripted sequences which allowed the player to maintain control of
655980	661260	their character. This was a bold decision at the time, but it worked, creating a more seamless interrelation between the
661260	666380	plotline and the gameplay. With the previews of Hunt Down the Freeman, it seemed that they were going to be relying more
666380	671860	heavily on cutscenes to tell the story, which many seemed confused by. Now, obviously, a game can take the creative
671860	677420	liberties that it feels comfortable with, and on principle, if it helps create a better product, then so be it. However,
677460	683180	in the original, the lack of cutscenes wasn't just any old creative decision, it was a decision that for a long time was
683180	689500	identifiable with the series, and if a game alienates itself from a franchise's distinguishable elements, then what
689500	693340	appeal does it have to the consumer who is familiar with the established universe?
693340	708460	And these cutscenes have an opportunity to tell a story or tell an emotion that normally in gameplay cannot do.
708460	714380	There's nothing wrong with providing a new spin, with new features and new ideas, but for many fans, you also need to be
714380	719540	in touch with the spirit and the mantra of what made the original game successful, and Birkin was having trouble
719540	725260	latching onto that. This issue was most illuminated in an interview a few days later with a creator from the community.
725260	731060	Although passionate, driven with ample ability and experience with the Half-Life games, he had trouble justifying the
731060	731820	fundraising.
731820	739980	The heck is this guy? Now, it's quite possible that you could make the best game ever. I'm not saying that you can't do that,
739980	745500	I'm saying that people will say, well, I'm not going to give money to somebody that I've never heard of. How would you
745500	746500	address those people?
746500	756620	And now we have opportunity to give people something really, really beautiful. But that's the thing that people ask,
756620	765940	why it's $100,000? Oh my God, you want $100,000? People get really suspicious, like, why you want that much?
765940	775540	Firstly, 10% of the money goes to the tax and Indiegogo, so there's only $90,000 left. And $50,000 of that just goes to
775540	784580	the licensing of the game. And there's only $40,000. With that $40,000, we have to make all the characters all over again.
784620	790180	And it's not like he doesn't have a point here. With the boldness of such objectives, you need a lot of money, but the
790180	796860	boldness here bordered on temerity for many prospective supporters, and for someone with no track record in publishing
796860	803260	game mods, let alone Half-Life mods, people needed more than his word, and even then, his word could have been a bit
803260	804260	more convincing.
804260	810420	And we have to get new textures, and we have to get voice acting. Like, voice acting is not really cheap.
810580	816100	It was clear that there was still lots of work to be done, but Birken was ready to put in the hours.
824420	833580	That's why I like to announce that we're gonna make a playable demo for Hunt Under Freeman. I was thinking about it,
833580	840700	but I wasn't sure should I do it or not. I see that people didn't understand and question the cutscenes, and how it's
840700	847700	gonna work. Like, there's so much different, not like a Half-Life game, and it's not like a Half-Life game, to be
847700	856700	honest. I'm not telling it, oh, it's gonna be exact like Half-Life, because I'm not giving you just new levels. I'm
856700	858700	giving you a whole new game.
858940	864980	When you're fundraising for an idea which hasn't been fully manufactured yet, trust is a huge constituent. People are
864980	870780	giving you money on the back of what they believe you can do, rather than what you've done. Those with a reputation to
870780	876100	produce results may have a bit more success on this front. However, someone like Birken simply couldn't win over people
876100	881740	with a couple videos and screenshots, and even then, what was currently shown was unlikely to resemble the finished
881740	888180	product, as Birken intended to use the capital to purchase new engines, tools, and models, or the preview and trailer
888180	894660	for really gay fans was a look at the possible storyline and some design concepts. For many, that was simply not enough.
894660	900340	However, Birken was conscious of this, and following the onslaught of audience concerns, announced the development of a
900340	906260	demo, to provide users with further confidence in his ability and potential. He discussed this in the days following
906260	910980	the initial Greenlight post, and even in the aforementioned interview, however, the official post declaring this was
910980	916980	made on the 11th of July, just under a week after the IndieGoGo page went live. Most responses to this were actually
916980	922420	pretty positive, with many expressing anticipation for the upcoming release. However, there were also very few
922420	928100	replies, and it was clear that at the time, general interest was dwindling, many had clicked onto the page,
928100	934260	saw that there was very little there for them, and moved on. Unfortunately, this was a major miscalculation on the
934260	940020	marketing front, you really need to put people in with the preview content to maintain interest, and what was there
940020	946540	simply was not sufficient, which led to a lot of users dropping by and not sticking around. They didn't seem to have a
946580	952340	plan beyond the immediate community either, appealing to a fan base is not the worst idea, but unless those you appeal
952340	957900	to aren't desperate, then they're unlikely to blindly throw their money at it. Even the most brainwashed individuals
957900	963420	may support the game or the developments, but as an outsider pledging to alter the fabric of what made the original
963420	969620	successful, Birken was barking up the wrong tree. At this point, the only possible vindication could be found in the
969620	975260	impending demo release. If it was high enough quality, then it could be used as a springboard to show the capacity of
975300	981580	the team behind this vision. So come September, the moment of truth was upon us, and Birken finally, finally had the
981580	987100	chance to show those who doubted him what he was really made of. In interviews, he had championed himself as a
987100	993100	perfectionist, even citing his chronic perfectionism as the reason that he hadn't released any previous mods.
993460	999900	So have you made any mods yourself? Have you created any maps or any mods before?
999900	1005500	Yes, I did. Actually, I did this like last five years, but I'm a
1006620	1010500	person that when I create something, it has to be perfect, and if it's not perfect,
1011060	1018820	it cannot be outside. So finally, we were able to have a sample of Birken's perfection. What flavour had he achieved?
1023300	1025980	You think you're so cool with your stick,
1026900	1028900	bullying citizens.
1029140	1033880	You didn't see what I did. My brothers did. The captain did.
1034960	1042020	You couldn't know anything we lived through. To put it nicely, it was an acquired taste. Now,
1042020	1045460	it wasn't the worst thing ever witnessed to man. By many standards,
1045460	1047300	it was an average playthrough,
1047300	1052340	but that was that it was also not the saving grace of the project needed, and there were glaring gaps in the
1052500	1056620	competency which would have put off many people who may have approached the demo with an open mind.
1057420	1059420	We are under heavy fire.
1062060	1064140	Ally combine forces are dead.
1065700	1069540	The truth is that this content should have been released alongside the fundraiser.
1069540	1075300	This would have given them more time and allow them to iron out any blemishes that were too conspicuous. In too many places,
1075300	1080580	the output just felt rushed, and maybe it was, given that they were struggling to hang on to subdued
1080580	1083260	interest from the gaming world. Even with that in mind,
1083260	1089520	it probably would have paid dividends to spend a bit more time touching up certain elements, because this is a long-term investment.
1090040	1095140	Users won't expect a demo to be perfect, but as a showcase of the talent behind Birkin's team,
1095140	1101660	there was very little content that would inspire hope in audiences, and certainly not enough to encourage them to give up their hard-earned cash.
1101660	1104900	And after a few months, the Indiegogo project sat at a measly
1105900	1111220	$12 of its 100,000 target, a number that, in spite of all the criticisms,
1111460	1118380	still surprised me, because I assumed that something of this scale and mild publicity would at least have some people donating for the hell
1118380	1124300	of it. But my assumption was incorrect, and in spite of all the names attached to this project, the time invested, and the
1124660	1129820	confidence of its lead, all progress was brought to a halt, and the team seemingly disbanded.
1129980	1135340	There was one silver lining to this cloud, though, and that was that the game had been green-lighted through Steam's process.
1135540	1139620	Nonetheless, if there was no team to take it forward, then this detail was frankly meaningless.
1139860	1143340	However, as I'm sure you know, this was far from the end of the story.
1143340	1146020	You see, some say you can't keep a good man down,
1146180	1153020	but that's not entirely true, because the moral content of one's character doesn't come into it if they're dogged enough, and regardless of
1153020	1153900	Birkin's nature,
1153900	1159620	he was a man on a mission, and was already preparing to renew his efforts once more. Enter stage left,
1159660	1161660	Royal Rudious Entertainment.
1162020	1169540	Royal Rudious Entertainment, or RRE, was the company set up to carry Hunt Down the Freeman forward from its previous shortcomings.
1169540	1170260	With that in mind,
1170260	1176060	it seems that it was being established shortly before the demo was published, and the crowdfunding campaign brought to an end.
1176060	1182460	The Twitter account was set up in August 2016, and although it would be a year until another promotional campaign would be launched,
1182460	1187660	Birkin was working hard, making sure that this time, Hunt Down the Freeman would be a resounding success.
1187860	1194740	A now deleted article published in a Turkish magazine, Technology, disclosed the development in January 2017,
1194740	1198980	which appeared to follow a tweet interaction where an employee stated that they were a part of the project.
1198980	1203500	Once again, bar the occasional tweet, it seems that Birkin chose to keep this venture predominantly under wraps,
1203500	1208780	likely causing it to fade from people's memory, and allowing them to return to their lives of blissful ignorance.
1208780	1215300	Alas, all good things must come to an end, and at the end of 2017, both Birkin and Royal Rudious Entertainment
1215340	1220940	ignited their social media presence to announce that Hunt Down the Freeman was back, and more powerful than ever.
1229460	1234900	But nobody was quite ready for the tricks that Birkin had been hiding up his sleeve, not even some of the tricks themselves.
1235260	1239540	Yes, it seems that they were in for a bit of a shock, but like much of this story,
1239540	1244540	even if you knew what was going to happen, it would still manage to subvert your expectations.
1245300	1260540	In a way, the fact that Birkin's original fundraiser had flopped so terribly enabled him to move rather seamlessly
1260540	1265580	into what we can assume was his plan B. If the project had originally received moderate support,
1265580	1270100	with some people's expectations resting on it, then the outcome could have been very different.
1270140	1273660	The developers would have needed to keep public donors in the loop with the progress,
1273660	1279020	and this could have led to a consistent stream of scrutiny, which could have accrued the game some lasting notoriety
1279020	1284500	if people became dissatisfied with the product. Instead, by keeping financing and labor behind closed doors,
1284500	1288700	it allowed them to operate and recruit without their previous reputation hampering them.
1288700	1294140	This was particularly vital to their subsequent marketing strategy, which employed a fresh approach for what it was attempting to sell,
1294140	1300060	though at its core was a technique not unheard of. Yes, our good friend Birkin was working behind the scenes on a team
1300060	1304780	that would make the game a hit, but would it make the game good? Well...
1304780	1316460	Birkin's voice, after a few tweets foreshadowing the launch of the long awaited game,
1316460	1322900	a teaser was posted on January 6th, 2018, with Agri the most infamous character from the original series,
1322900	1326060	G-Man providing exposition for the game's protagonist.
1326260	1337300	I do have to admit, I'm impressed that you made it back, alive from Black Mesa, even if it wasn't our intention to begin with.
1337300	1340940	Alongside came a few statuses from those involved promoting the game.
1340940	1347380	Now, a lot of developers and employers do not have the strongest social media presence, even Birkin's following was quite derisory.
1347380	1353860	However, the game received a significant signal boost from a few creators, many of whom had been recruited by Birkin to voice characters.
1353860	1361060	In fact, the cast appeared to include Pyrocynical, I Hate Everything, ColossusCrazy, and Keemstar,
1361060	1365940	some of whom posted rather roped comments about their involvement, accompanied by a link to the steam page.
1365940	1371580	This provided an extra helping of publicity for their operation, and audience reaction was broadly positive.
1371580	1377500	This is mainly because it focuses on one of the game's strongest assets, the G-Man, whose voice actor does a pretty good job
1377500	1380700	at emulating the original's inflections and intonation.
1380740	1386540	However, if you look beyond this, there were already a few cracks in the visage that should have been cause for concern.
1386540	1389620	Firstly, the scripting in general just felt a bit clunky.
1389620	1397100	Even if it wasn't our intention to begin with, yet you are still here.
1397100	1401500	You should have just died there, but here you are.
1401500	1407620	At this point, he goes from being this foreboding trailer narrator, to verbally tripping over himself in what appears to be
1407660	1411140	outward annoyance at the fact that our protagonist is still alive.
1411140	1417260	I don't think this was the intended tone, I think they were more over attempting to use repetition to engrain the message of the premise.
1417260	1422260	However, its usage is excessive, and comes across as rather graceless in its delivery.
1422260	1428660	Another less noticeable, yet probably more telling red flag, is the G-Man's pronunciation of Black Mesa.
1428660	1432100	Black, alive from Black Mesa.
1432140	1437460	Now, although a more subtle mistake, the fact that nobody involved had corrected the voice actor,
1437460	1443180	and ensured another take of an otherwise simple line, to me seemed like a failure in elementary diligence.
1443180	1447940	They had more than ample time to prepare this, and they were still falling at basic hurdles.
1447940	1453540	All in all, this would understandably cause reservation amongst people more familiar with the Half-Life series.
1453540	1457940	However, whereas in the past, much of the fandom had controlled the general verdict on the game,
1457940	1462860	here they were outnumbered by those slightly less aware of the details and taken in by the hype,
1462860	1465180	and perhaps the inclusion of their favourite creators.
1465180	1468940	I don't think it's the audience's fault that these flaws may have been overlooked at the time,
1468940	1472180	it's easy to analyse it with the enlightened glory of hindsight.
1472180	1474980	If I was a casual viewer, I probably would have missed it as well.
1474980	1480740	What this does tell us, though, is that Birkin and his team hadn't become any more rigorous when it came to quality control,
1480740	1484100	they'd just found a new way to drown out the incoming criticism.
1484180	1488900	Not too long after the teaser, its Steam page was erected, with the previews posted there as well.
1488900	1492500	The forecast was sunshine and rainbows for the team behind the Half-Life spin-off,
1492500	1495700	as the music teaser was also released to audience anticipation.
1495700	1498020	However, it wasn't all plain sailing.
1498020	1503620	Yes, many detractors were still present amongst the community, most notably the Lambda Generation Twitter account,
1503620	1506620	representing the, quote, ultimate Half-Life community.
1506620	1512220	Over the next three weeks, Royal Rudeus faced down and addressed accusations regarding general quality control,
1512220	1517660	and more importantly, their use of stolen assets, in their newest trailer and in previous versions of the game,
1517660	1519900	most notably their 2016 demo.
1519900	1525660	One former team member made a public statement chastising Birkin and his management for the organisation of the game,
1525660	1530100	expressing fear that it could permanently damage the reputation of future Half-Life titles.
1530100	1533500	On the same day, Royal Rudeus posted a statement rebuffing these claims,
1533500	1538100	asserting that they had obtained all necessary licenses for assets used in the upcoming release,
1538100	1543780	and holding that although the 2016 demo had used unwarranted placeholders, they had since rectified this.
1543780	1546180	I'm going to save further discussion of this for later.
1546180	1552900	They ended up in a couple more unconvincing interactions where they attempted to distance themselves altogether from the 2016 demo,
1552900	1557700	as well as claiming that Birkin was not party to the inception of Royal Rudeus Entertainment.
1557700	1563140	However, most of this remained within the community, and RRE vowed to press on with the promotion of their game,
1563140	1565700	uploading an official trailer at the end of January.
1565780	1567220	I heard you're looking for a man.
1569780	1571140	A man in an orange suit.
1574020	1575620	A man with a crowbar.
1577380	1578700	Gordon Freeman.
1578980	1585340	It was this video that some issues began to appear more evident, mostly relating to the rather substandard audio mastering.
1586620	1592220	Was gone. Now it's back. A gift for the captain. Do you recognize it?
1593220	1597940	God help us. No. God will stay away from this one.
1597940	1603140	They had reused lines from the teaser, and the additional voice clips wouldn't have inspired much confidence either,
1603140	1607620	with IHG's phrases having vocal acoustics which did not remotely reflect the setting.
1607620	1611940	In fact, I question if anyone had even put his audio through a single filter.
1611940	1616380	I just don't understand why it's such an important thing. The captain needs to see it.
1616380	1621940	These were schoolboy errors, which becomes even worse when you consider that the trailer is meant to show the good parts.
1621940	1626740	With this upload, the reception was strikingly more negative, and although some people were still excited,
1626740	1631100	there was a trace of reservation and straight up cynicism from many viewers.
1631100	1635460	However, the curiosities still remain, and with the release date set for February 2nd,
1635460	1639940	there was only a few days until the masses would finally have their say on this enigma.
1639940	1644060	However, Team Broken wasn't as ready as they said they were.
1651940	1664820	This was a triumph. I'm making a note here. Huge success.
1664820	1666300	Yeah, this game sucks.
1666300	1671380	It's hard to overstate my satisfaction.
1671380	1673580	Holy shit, the game does not work.
1673580	1675140	Yeah, but you're science.
1675140	1677340	Everything about the game is a huge mess.
1677340	1680460	We do what we must because we can.
1680460	1682620	So fast forward to the game coming out, everyone hates it.
1682620	1687660	For the good of all of us, except the ones who are dead.
1687660	1688140	Who wrote this?
1688140	1690300	But there's no sense crying over any of this.
1690300	1692140	My fellow Americans.
1692140	1696100	You just keep on trying till you run out of cake.
1696100	1706340	And the science gets done and you make a neat run for the people who are still alive.
1706340	1710580	Ahem. What do you think you're doing?
1710580	1717820	Well, I literally just finished Portal two minutes ago and you can't just go barging into people's monitor, bro.
1717820	1720140	I won't when you finish your damn video.
1720140	1722420	Do you even know when the deadline is?
1722420	1724740	Yeah, it's a week from now, right?
1724740	1727620	No. The deadline was a week ago.
1727620	1728420	What?
1728420	1732100	Just finish the damn video. I already sent the audio.
1732100	1735500	I'll be watching you until then.
1735500	1765260	Hello and again, welcome to the Aperture Science Computer Aided Enrichment Center Hunt Down The Response is edited by LuckyMeAndChloe.
1765300	1769620	As the date loomed, many waited with bated breath to see what this game would bring us.
1769620	1773820	However, on the 31st of January, just before the second trailer was uploaded,
1773820	1778140	an announcement was posted by a good amigo Birkin regarding the status of the game.
1778140	1783900	He thanked people for their support, but also acknowledged one of the prevalent concerns voiced by many regarding the file size.
1783900	1787380	He expresses sympathy and says that they have been working on a solution.
1787380	1792220	However, we'll need more time to implement this, and thus we'll be delaying the release by six days.
1792260	1797340	This has formalized the following day on the Steam page, with the date being moved back to February the 8th.
1797340	1802260	Okay, so just under a week, gamers have seen far worse delays in their time,
1802260	1807300	and people were willing to wait a bit longer if it allowed the developers to make a game more accessible for users.
1807300	1813100	However, come February the 8th, another post was published stating that they will be deferring release once more,
1813100	1817180	this time to perfect the game, in hopes that it will be primed for application.
1817220	1822940	RRE also made the tangential comment that they didn't realize they had 50 levels until a few hours ago,
1822940	1827980	which I think is an attempt to hype up the game, but just makes them seem more incompetent.
1827980	1831660	Like, you didn't plan how many levels you were gonna have.
1831660	1838820	So although bemusing, it was also believable, given that some dips in quality had been seen in certain previews.
1838820	1842420	So people once more shrugged their shoulders and bided their time.
1842460	1848220	The new date was set for February the 15th, and as it came around, you can probably guess what happened.
1851220	1852940	Another delay. Oh, joy.
1853500	1859180	This time, it was bound for the cause of this postponement, as they were to test and approve the game before release.
1859180	1860740	How inconvenient.
1860740	1864460	It likely surprised many people that this had not been arranged in advance,
1864480	1867060	but given the organization of the project thus far,
1867060	1872220	I suppose it wasn't beyond belief that they had just tacked this onto the end of an already shambolic rigmarole.
1872420	1887220	🎵Music🎵
1887220	1891140	Nonetheless, the post in question seemed to be their flimsiest explanation yet,
1891140	1895380	and there were only so many times they could tantalise their patrons in such a way.
1895380	1901500	However, this time they pledged it would be their final delay, and that February the 21st would be the day of reckoning.
1901500	1907180	So the day came around, the time was upon us, the court of public opinion was in session,
1907180	1910220	we could finally find out- no, never mind, it was delayed again.
1910220	1915420	At the trajectory this game was on, this video wasn't going to be a retrospective.
1915420	1922780	It was becoming such a circus that even members of the team were beginning to publicly vent their exasperation at the handling of the launch.
1922780	1930620	However, we were spared further suffering on the 23rd of February, when the game was finally unveiled on Steam to a triumphant fanfare.
1930700	1932460	Was it worth the wait?
1932460	1936860	It also fairly obviously nicked a lot of its new content, weapons and level architecture from asset stores and other mods,
1936860	1938700	as again, some of it looked competently made.
1938700	1943020	But it's all been dropped into the game with the care and precision with which turds are placed in the bottom of a budgie cage.
1943020	1946780	The kind of thing where you're walking to an over large room and there's just 12 zombies arranged in a neat row
1946780	1950300	because I guess the people in this room were doing the fucking hokey cokey when the aliens invaded.
1950300	1953100	I've never been so happy to see the ending screen of a video game,
1953100	1957580	and about the only positive takeaway I can see from this whole thing is that I'll never have to play it again.
1957580	1961260	And hopefully this video will serve as a warning to other Sunny Gems thinking about picking it up.
1961260	1963260	Hunt down the refund indeed.
1963260	1966300	Uh-uh. No, no, no, no.
1966300	1970620	No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
1970620	1973820	Uh-uh! Nuh-uh!
1973820	1979180	You do not deserve to use this map!
1979180	1981180	No!
1982860	1984300	Fuuuuuuuck!
1987580	1997260	Unfortunately not, it was as awful as possibly feared, maybe even worse,
1997260	2003140	with the most embarrassing aspect being the excess of bugs, which many would have hoped parts of the extended
2003140	2008900	deadline were set aside for. The game would regularly crash, cutscenes were missing, audio levels were skewed.
2008900	2015020	It was practically unplayable on release. It was so bad you wouldn't be unreasonable in thinking it was all one big
2015020	2020340	ruse to hoodwink fans out of their money, and it wasn't just the unintended errors that were noticeable either.
2020340	2023540	Why don't, why don't they have textures on their eyes?
2023540	2025220	Hello captain, captain.
2025220	2032420	Why are they all voiced by me? I don't, I don't like the, hey shut, shut the game off, shut the game off, put, put the plot out of the shot.
2032420	2037380	You can tell me to calm down, there's a gas leak that can blow half of us all the way to hell with a fucking match.
2037380	2039380	Remember, no weapons.
2042500	2044660	Wait a minute, I thought you said no weapons.
2044660	2051060	Yeah, some, some gas leak, am I right guys?
2051060	2058020	There was lack of competence exhibited in multiple technical areas, including storyline, map design, controls, visual textures,
2058020	2065780	scripting, audio mastering, and voice acting. My god, the voice acting. Two words, President Keemstar.
2065780	2082100	My fellow Americans, as your president and commander-in-chief, it is with a heavy heart that I'm informing you that we have made a strategic decision.
2082100	2108500	They even changed the plot to what was shown in the trailer, the guy who was originally Gordon Freeman was now a masked man,
2108500	2116020	so the plot has even less relevance to the original Half-Life series, undermining a fair bit of the intrigue behind the premise.
2116020	2122580	I mean, I could go on, but it was a terrible game, and it was wholly rejected by the community and casuals alike.
2122580	2127460	You didn't need to be a gaming connoisseur to recognize the absence of quality.
2127460	2133620	Royal Rudeus would make a few more posts responding to the issues present in their title, implementing a day one patch,
2133620	2138180	which allegedly fixed the in-game glitches, though many reviewers disputed this.
2138180	2146820	However, outrage didn't just end at the audience, with some members of the development team clearly upset by the hackneyed job carried out by RRE,
2146820	2151300	how their work was treated by the direction team, and more specifically, Birkin.
2151300	2158100	An interview with Kotaku, the head of PR, gave Sumner a claim that the wrong version of the game had been uploaded to Steam,
2158180	2160260	but others had their own explanations.
2160700	2167140	The most outspoken advocate on this issue was an individual by the name of Telby, he was the sound designer on Hunt Down the Freeman,
2167140	2171300	like many others, a facet of the game which wasn't met with glowing praise.
2171300	2176980	He was also the person who had previously aired his annoyance at the numerous delays, however, had defended the game,
2176980	2181020	and even elements of the management, in spite of his recent criticisms.
2188100	2197860	This time, that nuanced perspective was buried six feet under, with him ripping into Birkin and the management from practically every angle,
2197860	2201860	telling a story of narcissism and ineptitude of the highest order.
2201860	2209380	It frames our director in chief as a guy with far more confidence than his ability permitted, and this is pretty in line with previous portrayals,
2209380	2216180	but here it's been to a dramatic detriment of the game, with many employees' work, like Telby's here, being completely compromised.
2216180	2225380	Now, of course, this may be what a disgruntled employee says, but it fits in with Birkin's established reputation and would explain a lot of technical shortcomings.
2225380	2234020	Telby also alleges that many of the delays were publicity stunts, which once again may also explain why the game doesn't feel like it's been polished,
2234020	2238420	alongside some of the rather unconvincing excuses they put out in the past.
2238580	2248740	The creator of Hunt Down the Freeman, he acted upon that naivetivity, that naivetivity of thinking you could make a game like this and actually pull together investors and people and developers to work on it.
2248740	2260020	So all it really is is just an overestimation, an overextension of what one can meet his own goals with, and it created an interesting result, and I think it's something to take note of.
2260020	2267140	Another more emotionally reasoned insider response was that from a guy by the name of Dreadile, who had also worked on the game, contributing to some of the sound design as well.
2267140	2277460	God bless him, Birkin had an idea, and he tried to bring it to life. It doesn't always hit the mark, and there was a lot of external forces at play, I'm sure, both with investors and who knows what,
2277460	2286020	but there still is a respect there for someone trying to create something and then also still getting to the point of releasing it, which most people don't even get to.
2286020	2292100	He had kind of worse to say about Birkin on a personal level, however also sincere concern to express given the state of the product.
2292100	2298900	When the customer's happy, the game makes money, you're able to pay off investors and etcetera, and they've come out and said that they have investors.
2298900	2308420	This game is not going to sell. It launched broken. It launched unplayable. This game is unplayable, and I'll talk a tiny bit about it as we go forward, but I'm actually a little scared for it.
2308420	2313940	I think that they might be in some serious trouble right now, like money wise, potentially, if they can't get these issues resolved.
2313940	2321860	Alongside that, he had seen criticism to bestow unto the creators behind the doomed enterprise, exposing the incompetence exhibited during much of the process.
2321860	2327220	There are a couple of things that keep you grounded when working on a game. One of them is a game design document.
2327220	2334900	Now, when I was approached to work on Hunt Down the Freeman a year and a half ago, Birkin was pitching me on the game and I didn't really understand what he was talking about.
2334900	2341780	It didn't make too much sense to me in my head. I was just kind of going, yeah, yeah, yeah. And I had this weird feeling about everything.
2341780	2348820	Felt like something was not right. So when he was asking me to do some work for it, I was pretty adamant about getting the game design document.
2349780	2360500	And I will tell you that there was no game design document. All the ideas sort of came from the head of the creator with minimal, minimal, minimal scripting work done, I'm sure.
2360500	2377540	And so it reflects as such when you have 60 independent contractors all working for you and you have them each do once one piece without even knowing what it's going to contribute to the overall consistency and congeniality of the story.
2377700	2380260	You get a clusterfuck, you get this.
2380260	2388980	To be fair, he imparted some firm but pretty fair advice, still wishing the team the best, but also hoping they would act in the interest of those who had offered their money and time to the game.
2388980	2397060	There is only one way. That is to one, take down the game from Steam. It is unfortunately an unfinished game and a very poorly designed game.
2397060	2403780	And if you want to create a product of value, you're going to have to take this down and completely redesign it. It just is not up to scratch.
2403780	2419620	Issue a statement with 100% honesty about the shortcomings, both with communication within the team and outside of the team, you know, to the community, and then spend a solid two years of hard development in order to get this game up to any kind of presentable state to the point where it's playable.
2419620	2433540	And at that point, you still probably might have a 10% chance of success. I mean, the damage is kind of already done, both to the reputation of the company, Rorudius Entertainment, and to the game itself, which has very negative reviews right now.
2433540	2446540	Would Birkin heed these words of wisdom? Well, not too long after, Birkin would make a post on the Steam page. I mean, it's signed RRE team, but I'm 99% sure it's Birkin, mainly because of how defensive it is.
2446540	2457540	Basically, the post claimed that towards the end of development, the team were hounded by false allegations from those within the community, which pressured them into pushing through production and releasing the unfinished game.
2457540	2465780	Turns out, this only escalated the persecution they were facing, and this has upset them a lot, as no one has even asked them for their side.
2465780	2476220	This community is just concerned with drama, drama, drama, drama, disgusting. However, in spite of all this, they were committed to working on the game and continuing to improve it.
2476220	2486020	That's what this says about their character. They wanted to repair that lost trust. However, before they had the chance to do that, they were to be hunted down themselves.
2487540	2498540	That's it. I've been watching you all day, and all you do is play, play, play. I'm shutting all of this down right now.
2498540	2513540	You hear that over there? Yeah, they're very faint at this point in the story. You can barely hear them. That's because I'm a moron, and I don't see the biggest warning signs coming from a mile away.
2513540	2521540	The call also sent me a thing like, every word equals this much money. Want your payment? I was like, I don't want your fucking payment.
2521540	2530540	What was it? You didn't take it? It allegedly uses assets stolen from the Garry's Mod workshop. It told Birkin, I was like, please delay this. Please delay this. Several months.
2530540	2546540	I haven't actually been paid as of now, so. I gotta just explain this to people. What it was like working on it. How much of a disaster it has turned out to be.
2546540	2561540	People don't tend to hold mods or fan made spin-offs to unreasonable standards. We're all aware that studios have a greater capacity to manufacture high production value content.
2561540	2570540	At the same time, we're also aware that funding doesn't solely dictate the quality of a game. There are many great indie games that were built off the back of budgets most moderate.
2570540	2577540	With this in mind, the indie developers who tend to succeed in this area are the ones who are aware of the limitations that such financial constraints may bring,
2577540	2586540	and have the ability to work with mine to their pecuniary blueprint. Birkin was clearly not one for limitations, and his grasp far exceeded his reach.
2586540	2595540	The amount of money he was working with was still well below that of a proper corporate fund adventure, yet it was constantly hailed as the magnum opus of this budding businessman.
2596540	2603540	In this context, many considered him to be the Tommy Wiseau of gaming, attempting to create something that his ability clearly didn't enable him to.
2603540	2614540	Now, there are a lot of parallels that can be drawn to Tommy Wiseau and The Room in this intriguing tale. However, one of the stark differences that I would draw is that The Room is entertaining in its dreadfulness,
2614540	2623540	and Hunt Down the Freeman is considered by many to be painstakingly boring. Most people consider the cutscenes to be the most entertaining inclusion,
2623540	2630540	however, even then, it's just immensely cliched lines that will have you uprooting all the delicate follicles on your beautiful, beautiful scalp.
2631540	2635540	Your name. Who are you?
2635540	2637540	Mitchell.
2637540	2639540	Mitchell, huh?
2639540	2644540	Yes, Mitchell. A name with many meanings.
2644540	2652540	For some, the meaning is a gift from God. For others, who is like God?
2652540	2658540	Which one are you, Mitchell? Are you a gift from God sent to save us?
2658540	2664540	Or perhaps you are God himself come to doom our worthless lives?
2664540	2665540	Perhaps.
2665540	2667540	He's cursed.
2667540	2670540	I always saw you as a hero after that day.
2670540	2678540	Hero? You're talking to a villain, my dear. The hero inside of me died many, many years ago when I was young.
2678540	2684540	The Room obtained its status by proxy of its own merit, even if that merit was its own catastrophe.
2684540	2690540	In comparison, Hunt Down the Freeman Millie used the fame of its YouTuber cast and employed a cunning marketing strategy,
2690540	2696540	which built hype within fan bases and managed to overcome any vocal descent from communities intimate to the series.
2696540	2702540	Nonetheless, you can hype up the pudding all you want. The proof will always be in the eating.
2702540	2708540	Therefore, although the game was released to more publicity than would be expected for a title of that stature,
2708540	2712540	it was similarly berated by almost anyone able to formulate an opinion online,
2712540	2715540	bringing into question those associated with the project.
2715540	2719540	As with Telby, there'll always be some finger pointing when a game drastically underperforms,
2719540	2724540	but this will typically amount to a lot of conflicting testimonies that don't leave the inner circle of those invested.
2724540	2729540	However, at the same time, by giving prominent roles to creators who had large platforms and media followings,
2729540	2733540	Birkin ran the risk of being publicly implicated if the project went haywire,
2733540	2738540	particularly given these were not just any old YouTubers, but the fabled commentator.
2738540	2741540	Commentators can be quite concerned with their public image,
2741540	2744540	given that their narratives are often loaded with moral principles and beliefs,
2744540	2749540	and therefore, in light of this failure, a couple sought to explain their position on the game,
2749540	2751540	while also sharing their thoughts on its caliber.
2751540	2756540	When I was approached by a guy telling me that he was making a Half-Life mod and that I could voice act in it,
2756540	2760540	I thought, hey, what could possibly go wrong? Hello, captain.
2760540	2764540	Stories told were pretty similar. People were invited onto the project,
2764540	2770540	they thought, why not, and subsequently regretted it, while observing all the amateurish direction exhibited by management.
2770540	2775540	Basically, it crescendoed from little tiny alarm bells just in the distance.
2775540	2779540	Can you hear that way back there? Can you hear that over there?
2779540	2784540	Yeah, they're very faint at this point in the story. You can barely hear them.
2784540	2789540	That's because I'm a moron and I don't see the biggest warning signs coming from a mile away.
2789540	2799540	From the get-go, I had to sign a contract, which was a Gmail, or like an email,
2799540	2806540	with the details of the contract within the email, and signing it was replying to the email with my name.
2806540	2810540	The most informative video on this saga is the upload by I Hate Everything,
2810540	2813540	who documents some of the rather dodgy practices employed by Birkin,
2813540	2817540	including out of context lines to be recorded that were sent over Skype,
2817540	2820540	and a contract that was validated by replying with the person's name.
2820540	2828540	So my character was Asian, and at first, they were also supposed to be American, have an American accent.
2828540	2832540	So an American Asian. So the alarm bell's getting louder.
2832540	2840540	You do realize I'm English, right? I have a very, very noticeable English accent.
2840540	2844540	He was convinced I could do it, so I tried it for him.
2844540	2850540	With none of this direction or context, I did the lines that I was given in this American accent.
2850540	2854540	Then weeks go by and I get some feedback.
2854540	2860540	Yeah, we don't want to do the American accent anymore. Just do whatever you want, pretty much.
2860540	2864540	And I'm like, oh, okay, then I'll just be English then. It's a lot easier for me.
2864540	2868540	So then when it comes to the final product, and I'm skipping through the cutscenes,
2868540	2877540	like, what is this? And I find both the American and the English lines are in it.
2877540	2881540	Do what the hell you gotta do, but I'm not going to be a part of this.
2881540	2885540	However, regardless of who was talking about it, the consensus was the same,
2885540	2890540	that Birkin was in way over his head, and that he did not harness the creative skills to bring together such a vision.
2890540	2894540	And on top of the fact you're hiring YouTubers as voice actors,
2894540	2904540	expecting this melancholy, overdramatic, dark, edgy drama kind of thing, kind of tone,
2904540	2912540	very serious tone that requires A, good writing and B, good actors to perform said writing.
2912540	2916540	The two biggest pillars are already, they've already collapsed.
2916540	2920540	And I don't know how that kind of oversight can be overlooked.
2920540	2925540	Unfortunately, in spite of the defiant steam post, Birkin had the cast stacked against him.
2925540	2929540	It is, of course, very easy in these circumstances to blame the guy at the top,
2929540	2932540	and I'm sure there were oversights which went beyond his responsibility.
2932540	2937540	But ultimately, when you credit yourself as the creator, writer, producer, director,
2937540	2943540	and refer to it as a Birkin-Denise Aaron game, then you have to accept that at least some of the buck is going to stop at you.
2943540	2949540	False hope. I know the director. I mean, I told him I was making this video.
2949540	2956540	I was like, man, I got to just explain this to people, what it was like working on it,
2956540	2962540	how much of a disaster it has turned out to be, because it just seems weird otherwise.
2962540	2967540	Like, people are seeing or hearing my voice in this game, and they're like, wait, is that?
2967540	2972540	I'm like, what is he doing in this? I hate this game. I don't want to hear that.
2972540	2978540	And he was adamant that the game, it was the wrong version that released,
2978540	2984540	and it was a broken version, and they have a better version that should have gone up,
2984540	2990540	and I'm just like, well, that's even worse to do that.
2990540	2994540	That's even more of an unprofessional move.
2994540	2998540	Birkin had reached out to creators, begging them to hold off their videos,
2998540	3001540	with the pledge that the game would be fixed as soon as possible.
3001540	3005540	But unfortunately, given that many of the changes he had already promised were not in place,
3005540	3009540	there was little trust in his word, and those were the people he actually had contact with.
3009540	3013540	In the coming weeks, and even months, plenty of outsiders lined up,
3013540	3016540	raring to rag on the game for the reputation it had acquired,
3016540	3019540	and using the information posted by his critics.
3019540	3022540	The YouTube connection may have aided its marketing at first,
3022540	3024540	and there was no denying the attention it was receiving,
3024540	3029540	but if Birkin was hoping to become the darling of the gamer world, he was gravely mistaken.
3029540	3032540	Initially, when I was making this video, I gave the developers fair warning,
3032540	3035540	and in response, they told me to not make this video,
3035540	3038540	because they're bringing out a patch that would fix everything.
3038540	3043540	He said it would drop, let's see, oh yeah, four fucking days ago.
3043540	3047540	I don't think these guys are scam artists, I just don't think they're artists at all.
3047540	3050540	The consensus was clear, the creator burdened the blame,
3050540	3054540	and after further updates, in one final attempt to curb the criticism,
3054540	3056540	Birkin cut the steam price of the game.
3056540	3060540	In many ways, in spite of the sheer incompetence and the publicity it spawned,
3060540	3064540	Birkin appeared to care greatly about what people actually thought of the product,
3064540	3067540	and even with its reputation thoroughly dragged through the mud,
3067540	3070540	was attempting to find some sort of path back to redemption.
3070540	3074540	Many acknowledged this, and even with the number of people bothered by the game,
3074540	3077540	most creators tended to mitigate their criticism towards Birkin,
3077540	3081540	playing down the idea that he had acted maliciously in any capacity.
3081540	3083540	I can't say for certain in reading stories from the inside,
3083540	3086540	and watching one interview filmed just before the playable demo's release,
3086540	3091540	whether Birkin Denizarian, the game's director and writer, is malicious or incompetent.
3091540	3095540	So many people I work with on this progress,
3095540	3100540	only a couple people know the real, real concept of the game,
3100540	3104540	because I didn't know who I can trust and who I can't.
3104540	3107540	And I don't really like to bring it forward.
3107540	3111540	One of the posts I will link to in the description states that they don't want things to get incendiary.
3112540	3115540	So I'm leaning to saying that it's a case of stupidity rather than cruelty,
3115540	3118540	if only because I like to believe that in people.
3118540	3120540	However, not everyone subscribed to this point of view,
3120540	3124540	stating that some details were simply not excusable by ignorance.
3124540	3126540	What do these details entail?
3126540	3128540	Well, let's go there now.
3131540	3135540	And I'm just looking at it, thinking,
3135540	3139540	Oh, you poor man. He's so nice. He's very nice, man.
3139540	3142540	Just wanted to make a game, just wanted to make a fun game for people to enjoy.
3157540	3163540	Poor old Birkin. All he wanted to do was bring a game to life for the adoring devotees.
3163540	3165540	He's alive!
3165540	3169540	And sure, maybe he didn't quite have the ability to fully realise his vision.
3169540	3173540	He still had the noblest of intentions, correct?
3173540	3177540	Well, some would disagree, instead arguing that Birkin was a cynical charlatan,
3177540	3181540	seeking to capitalise off a community's nostalgia for a revered franchise.
3181540	3183540	How would one prove this?
3183540	3187540	Well, it's difficult to prove intent beyond a shadow of a doubt,
3187540	3191540	and most people here clearly worked from the assumption that Birkin was not acting with malice,
3191540	3193540	which is completely valid.
3193540	3198540	However, if a person perpetrates various shady deeds with awareness of the possible consequences,
3198540	3202540	then many would argue that they'd lose the benefit of the doubt we would typically grant them.
3202540	3204540	This was the case some argued for Birkin.
3204540	3209540	Now, producing and publishing a subpar game isn't sufficient evidence of a crooked character.
3209540	3212540	His bumbling approach can explain a lot of failures,
3212540	3215540	but some felt that certain actions had crossed a line.
3215540	3219540	Some felt that Birkin must have known how awful his game was before release,
3219540	3223540	and pushed on with it in the pursuit of dollar, regardless of the cost.
3223540	3225540	What would make people think that?
3225540	3228540	Well, first of all, let's go back to Steam Greenlight,
3228540	3232540	the former system to help indie developers release their game on the corresponding platform.
3232540	3234540	In spite of some success stories,
3234540	3239540	there were also flaws which had made it pretty unpopular with a fair few from the gaming community,
3239540	3244540	one of these being how easy it was for some bad actors to take advantage of the voting system,
3244540	3246540	and the rather unscrupulous standards in place.
3246540	3250540	For example, you could implement bots to simulate the impression of more support
3250540	3253540	than you were actually receiving, thus inflating your vote count
3253540	3255540	and the possibility that your game would be approved.
3255540	3259540	This is what some claimed that the team behind the game were attempting to carry out.
3259540	3264540	In an archived link, numerous bots ascribed to the site csgo-happy.ru
3264540	3267540	are listed as members of the game's Greenlight page,
3267540	3270540	implying that they had been bought by the team's management
3270540	3275540	and used to inflate Hunt Down the Freeman's support, rather than earning it on its own merits.
3275540	3281540	Now, Greenlight itself was discontinued in 2017, and replaced with a new system known as Steam Direct.
3281540	3285540	Therefore, if this was the case, it would have likely happened in 2016
3285540	3289540	when they were attempting to cultivate publicity for their unsuccessful crowdfunding project.
3289540	3292540	Nearly all these bots have since disappeared from the page,
3292540	3295540	but their significance remains, as some concluded their presence
3295540	3298540	was indicative of the campaign that Birkin was attempting to run.
3298540	3302540	Another prominent controversy is relating to the use of their assets.
3302540	3306540	Now, we've already discussed the unlicensed use of certain content in their 2016 demo,
3306540	3311540	and Royal Rudeus' rather futile attempts to distance themselves from that controversy,
3311540	3314540	as well as their supposed vindication from other development teams.
3314540	3319540	However, many contested that these dodgy dealings were still present in the official release,
3319540	3324540	with one user going as far as to write up a whole list of all the alleged stolen assets used in the game.
3324540	3328540	Once again, if true, it would show a conscious disregard for the profession,
3328540	3332540	and other creators who work in the field, with little care as to what went into the game.
3332540	3336540	It would also contradict the public statements that had been issued previously,
3336540	3341540	signifying additional dishonesty, and paying further credence into these cynical theories.
3341540	3344540	To supplement this, it was also claimed that when brought up,
3344540	3347540	people were being banned from the hunt down the Freeman Steam forums,
3347540	3352540	with one user sharing an image in which he left a pretty harsh comment, and being banned for slander.
3352540	3355540	Now, the comment was strong in its sentiments, but it's not slander,
3355540	3359540	because as any culture's Spider-Man fan knows, in print, it's libel.
3359540	3362540	Anyway, with that in mind, it's not really libelous either,
3362540	3368540	the only possibly dubious comment is the claim that the developers have admitted that it's a cash grab themselves,
3368540	3370540	something which I don't believe Birkin has done.
3370540	3376540	Even then, they'd have to prove that some guy in a Steam forum trash-talking has damaged their reputation,
3376540	3378540	and I really don't think they needed any help with that.
3378540	3383540	So with these in mind, some began to draw the conclusion that Birkin wasn't just some sincere fool,
3383540	3389540	but someone much more destructive and rapacious, with no concern for who he affected in the quest for success,
3389540	3391540	including many of those he worked with.
3391540	3395540	However, these allegations weren't exactly an open and shut case either.
3395540	3400540	When it came to the stolen assets debacle, a pretty thorough response was published onto the hunt down the Freeman forums,
3400540	3404540	going through each individual claim, either appearing to disprove the original poster,
3404540	3407540	or placing the burden of proof back onto them.
3407540	3410540	Although the dispute intercepts that much of the use in this game is lazy,
3410540	3415540	they assert that the developers likely had a license to use most of these assets in the official title,
3415540	3421540	and in spite of the fact that there probably was illicitly acquired content in the 2016 demo,
3421540	3424540	it couldn't really be attributed to them as it's a separate company.
3424540	3430540	Now, as noted, I don't entirely agree with this, and think that accountability can be extended to previous projects,
3430540	3433540	where there has been consistent involvement of certain individuals,
3433540	3437540	but I also don't think it's the biggest deal if they have changed their ways,
3437540	3441540	and although that's debatable, many didn't think it was fair to consider the assets stolen.
3441540	3444540	This was echoed in Gabe Sumner's response to another post,
3444540	3448540	where he also appears frustrated at the continued resurfacing of this claim.
3448540	3452540	He also repudiates the notion that bots were used in the green light system,
3452540	3454540	saying that it was probably someone trying to set them up.
3454540	3460540	I'm not entirely sure what stake a person would have in buying bots for the hunt down the Freeman green light page,
3460540	3466540	but people have done stranger things to set others up, so I suppose it's not impossible, though somewhat suspicious.
3466540	3473540	In fact, according to Gabe, the only illegal thing that RRE has done is not pay him, and other employees as well,
3473540	3475540	but other than that, we're all good.
3475540	3478540	Wait, what?
3478540	3482540	I must admit, I am somewhat surprised by the nonchalance of such remark,
3482540	3487540	but it seems these grievances could never impact a lot of the personnel's commitment to the game,
3487540	3489540	and even its tainted honour.
3489540	3492540	I do hold a mild level of admiration for that,
3492540	3495540	but it's hard to ignore a lot of the criticisms that people raised,
3495540	3499540	at the same time, with all the opinions of those actually involved in the game,
3499540	3504540	almost all of them seemed hesitant to say that the project or its director were ill-natured.
3504540	3507540	So what can be said about it?
3507540	3522540	There is a story here, and a man at the centre of it.
3522540	3525540	You see, while all the YouTubers and reviewers ragged on the game,
3525540	3529540	obliterating its fragile reputation in front of the braying public,
3529540	3533540	with those associated scrambling to salvage their personal investments,
3533540	3536540	a certain individual had gone surprisingly quiet,
3536540	3538540	Birken de Niziaren.
3538540	3541540	Like, voice acting is not really cheap.
3541540	3543540	I understand that.
3543540	3548540	Yeah, and I don't want a voice that, you know,
3548540	3553540	I played some modes, and there was voices that the programmers and level designers did,
3553540	3556540	and, I mean, it's okay, but, you know.
3556540	3558540	You want the best, I understand that.
3558540	3560540	I want it to be perfect.
3560540	3567540	In a rather angry Steam post, the Half-Life YouTuber Bolloxed claimed to have invested $50,000 in this venture,
3567540	3572540	which would at least explain the rather strange comments of support during the promotional operation.
3572540	3577540	This was, however, disputed by Gabe, and looking at her positive comments, they do seem pretty ironic,
3577540	3581540	though, once again, I'm not really sure of the point of all this,
3581540	3585540	but it's a weird subplot that reflects the landscape.
3585540	3589540	In the server, some members of the team converged, waited, and vented,
3589540	3593540	by the lack of game revisions and communications on Birken's part.
3593540	3596540	Maybe it was out of shock, maybe it was out of embarrassment,
3596540	3601540	maybe he'd come to the realisation there was little he could do to repair so much of the damage inflicted.
3601540	3605540	At this point, Birken's world was only as good as his actions.
3605540	3609540	If you look at the evidence, and accordingly compile a list of his errors slash misdeeds,
3609540	3612540	it begins to look quite damning for our Turkish friend.
3612540	3616540	Under his administration, people's work was misused or discarded.
3616540	3619540	The organisation was on par with Tarnacon.
3619540	3622540	His contributions in the script and direction were abysmal,
3622540	3625540	the release was botched, and he continuously promised patches and updates,
3625540	3628540	many of which people felt he didn't deliver.
3628540	3632540	I don't know if it's been sorted out since, but some people weren't paid,
3632540	3635540	and many felt ignored and mismanaged.
3635540	3640540	In hindsight, this shouldn't be a surprise given how underqualified Birken was.
3640540	3644540	Love him or hate him, he didn't have a clue on how to put a game together.
3644540	3649540	Now, I think it'd be fair to conclude that in spite of the copious number of issues you could raise with his conduct,
3649540	3655540	that he hadn't acted out of avarice or malice, in part because so many people who worked with him defended his character,
3655540	3660540	and also because this would be one hell of a project to carry out just to make a quick buck,
3660540	3663540	especially considering how you have to also pay Valve.
3663540	3667540	I do think that Birken's will to accomplish his vision was at the expense of common sense,
3667540	3670540	and subsequently those who fell victim to the reality.
3670540	3672540	Many of them were upset with how their work was treated,
3672540	3675540	many were harmed by the backlash of the game in general,
3675540	3677540	many felt their reputation was on the line,
3677540	3682540	and while Birken gave the workforce and the audience very little to appease the situation,
3682540	3684540	these wounds only deepened.
3684540	3688540	People who seek to criticize him on this basis have pretty strong grounding,
3688540	3690540	and you can't really defend it.
3690540	3692540	Birken's team deserved better.
3692540	3695540	However, Birken clearly wasn't just some talentless hack,
3695540	3698540	and to frame him as such would be a discredit to those who believed in him.
3699540	3703540	Yes, Birken clearly didn't possess the skills to turn out a high quality game,
3703540	3708540	but as noted, this should have been quite obvious when you look at the facts from a detached perspective.
3708540	3711540	When put to the practical test, this was continuously exposed,
3711540	3715540	the initial demo was rejected unanimously by fans with the series.
3715540	3720540	Need I remind you, he raised $12 while courting for support of his concept.
3720540	3723540	Virtually every preview was beset by multiple faults,
3723540	3728540	and his attitudes towards workplace professionalism would probably raise a few eyebrows to say the least.
3728540	3732540	However, in spite of all this, he managed to assemble a team of over 60 people,
3732540	3735540	raise enough money to buy the necessary licenses,
3735540	3742540	create and market a game by presenting others with a vision that persuaded them to give up their valuable time and money.
3742540	3746540	He was essentially selling tickets to the Hindenburg after it had crashed,
3746540	3749540	and it all came down to one thing, belief.
3749540	3753540	It's by virtue of the fact that Birken had so little going for him on a technical level,
3753540	3758540	which is a testament to his skills as a salesperson with a project he seemed to legitimately believe in.
3758540	3763540	He started from a losing position, and argued his way into a winning one.
3763540	3767540	A good salesman can sell a good product, a great salesman can sell a bad one.
3767540	3771540	Whether that's justifiable amount of money is irrelevant.
3771540	3776540	It doesn't matter whether it's 10k, 100k, or a million, nobody knows you,
3776540	3778540	and I think that's one of the problems that people have got.
3778540	3781540	But as you've already said, you're going to be releasing a mod now.
3781540	3787540	Is that because of the kind of response you got from the community?
3787540	3794540	Well, actually, I get the exact response I was thinking,
3794540	3798540	because some people love it, some people hate it,
3798540	3803540	and these haters actually made the game more popular right now.
3803540	3809540	Because hate is a fast way to make people know about it,
3809540	3811540	because they just go around and tell everyone,
3811540	3818540	hey, look, that dude made a Half-Life game, that's crazy, and it just makes it more popular.
3818540	3823540	Facing the bombardment of Sencha, Birken was silent, probably for many reasons,
3823540	3826540	most of them not positive, however, the truth remained,
3826540	3830540	that Birken had probably done the best he could with his relative skillset,
3830540	3834540	and in time, animosity fades, and your merits are noted.
3834540	3838540	As much as Hunt Down the Freeman makes Birken accountable for its failure,
3838540	3842540	his role as the driving force behind its inception is undeniable,
3842540	3846540	and the credit his colleagues give him for his passion is also beyond doubt.
3846540	3849540	It seems they weren't the only people who recognised this either,
3849540	3854540	because in 2019, Birken was hired by Activision Blizzard as a production coordinator,
3854540	3857540	with the company knowledgeable of his role in Hunt Down the Freeman.
3857540	3862540	This announcement was met with shock from many, some still insistent that he wasn't fit for the job,
3862540	3866540	others believing he had not atoned for his previous errors, such as payment,
3866540	3869540	something which certain individuals claim is still outstanding.
3869540	3874540	Nonetheless, that comes down to what those who actually worked on the project have to say,
3874540	3877540	which right now isn't too much all in all.
3877540	3881540	With a few exceptions, I think many involved were almost embarrassed that they didn't know better,
3881540	3884540	that they were won over by a dream rather than the reality,
3885540	3889540	which is possibly why they were all so reluctant to lay into Birken's management,
3889540	3892540	because they may have all felt somewhat complicit in that.
3892540	3894540	With that said, Birken was a headstrong guy,
3894540	3899540	and I think it would have taken more than a simple intervention to make him re-evaluate what he was creating.
3899540	3904540	I believe that was shown up in the Steam post, where he basically blamed the haters for the resulting mess,
3904540	3908540	because at that point, it was more than just a few people telling him it was a lost cause.
3908540	3913540	In the Twitter replies of his announcement, he depicted Hunt Down the Freeman as a learning curve,
3913540	3916540	which I think is fair, but it was also quite a costly one,
3916540	3921540	and I hope he took any chances to clear the air with those he worked with and compensate where he could,
3921540	3925540	because in spite of the mess it was, the game probably landed him his current job,
3925540	3930540	and that was in part thanks to the fact that a lot of people who could have thrown him under the bus chose not to,
3930540	3934540	and in all fairness, he didn't throw them under the bus either, and I respect that.
3934540	3938540	However, whether colleagues have moved on to greener pastures or not,
3939540	3944540	it will likely be a bittersweet experience for some, and just a bitter one for others.
3944540	3948540	With this in mind, I think it's time to wrap up this tale for the ages.
3948540	3968540	In many ways, it was true, Hunt Down the Freeman was an unmitigated disaster,
3968540	3973540	yet at the same time, it was an unparalleled feat, it really shouldn't exist,
3973540	3976540	and to be honest, people would probably be better off without it,
3976540	3981540	but with what people were working with, the fact that the game happened at all is a borderline miracle,
3981540	3984540	and I feel its failures have almost enlightened many in a way.
3984540	3990540	The buyers, although inconvenient, were probably mildly entertained by the fever dream that such a game represented,
3990540	3993540	while also being informed on bad financial decisions.
3993540	3998540	The YouTuber's lives have since gone on, Colossal may have even uploaded a video since then,
3998540	4004540	for them it's a funny, albeit slightly embarrassing story, no one really blames them for what was obviously bad casting,
4004540	4008540	and I doubt it'll harm their career prospects if they ever wanted to dabble in acting again.
4008540	4012540	The posse I feel most sympathy for is those who worked on the game,
4012540	4016540	there are a lot of talented people who clearly felt that the title's representation of the work
4016540	4019540	had distorted their efforts and besmirched their credentials.
4019540	4025540	Add in the further issues that many of them complained about, I really wouldn't blame them for wanting to forget this dumpster fire.
4025540	4030540	Nonetheless, hopefully enough time has elapsed and allowed those associated to find new opportunities.
4030540	4034540	I guess the moral of the story is to ensure that even if a person talks a convincing game,
4034540	4038540	that you sometimes have to look at their record to deliver on such commitments.
4038540	4042540	The same advice can be passed to investors, whoever they are.
4042540	4048540	Yet the man who had the most to learn was Birkin, but sometimes the best lesson is to know your limits.
4048540	4054540	Birkin is clearly an enthusiastic guy with infectious energy, but that's not always enough,
4054540	4059540	and he'd need to educate himself a bit if he ever wanted to enter the creative side of games production again.
4059540	4065540	Hopefully his new position plays a bit more into his comfort zone while allowing him to pick up new skills along the way.
4065540	4071540	Hunt Down the Freeman was a case of too much, too soon, but as a strange twist of fate,
4071540	4074540	it worked out for him, and I hope he doesn't forget that.
4074540	4079540	As mentioned, there are many similarities between The Room and Hunt Down the Freeman,
4079540	4084540	particularly their respective architects, but Hunt Down the Freeman was unexceptional on paper,
4084540	4091540	and most of the execution too, a substandard revenge shooter consisting of mostly mundane or repetitive gameplay,
4091540	4096540	with somewhat cornerly written cutscenes spliced in between. It was destined to be a flash in the pan,
4096540	4103540	but Birkin hyped it up in every way possible, with the YouTubers he brought in being front and centre over this elaborate plan.
4103540	4109540	What he said to them, we may never know, but it quickly manifested itself into something greater.
4109540	4113540	Incorporating famous names into your cast isn't some avant-garde strategy,
4113540	4117540	but the inclusion of these creators just makes the experience all the more surreal,
4117540	4123540	particularly commentators, many of whom are specifically known for their voices, it's hard to hear them as anyone else.
4123540	4126540	The only YouTuber who should voice act at all, really, is me.
4126540	4128540	Okay, what do you think?
4128540	4130540	That's quite something.
4130540	4131540	Come on!
4131540	4133540	My clients will be very pleased.
4133540	4137540	Okay, okay, okay. What do you say to 200k?
4137540	4144540	That sounds acceptable. In fact, it's quite low. My rich buyer probably would have paid a lot more even.
4144540	4150540	Fantastic! Yes! Hey! That's it!
4150540	4153540	Okay, okay, I'm proud of it. Just leave me alone, I like it.
4153540	4157540	Anyhow, the YouTube connection initiated a domino effect,
4157540	4161540	inflating coverage with many people harping on its flagrant issues and meme potential,
4161540	4166540	tarnishing yet immortalising its status within gaming and online cliques alike.
4166540	4172540	In a way, it highlights how easily we are influenced sometimes, yet also highlights the strength of our own influence.
4172540	4176540	At the end of the day, Hunt Down the Freeman certainly stuck in people's memories,
4176540	4179540	you could go as far to say it has a pretty decent half-life.
4180540	4183540	Oh, please spare me.
4183540	4188540	Speaking of, there's a lot of questions as to what this means for the Half-Life series itself,
4188540	4194540	and possibly other mods. I'd honestly say, not too much hopefully, though I do understand the concern.
4194540	4197540	There was another Half-Life mod released a couple of years before Hunt Down the Freeman
4197540	4199540	that received pretty mixed reviews from the community at the time.
4199540	4204540	I think some were worried that it was outlining a pattern of people trying to haphazardly invent content
4204540	4206540	to fill in gaps the previous games left.
4206540	4211540	However, I think Hunt Down the Freeman's reputation as a bad game with YouTubers involved
4211540	4214540	has superseded its reputation as a Half-Life spin-off.
4214540	4219540	I can understand how it may make prospective developers more tentative to act on personal inspiration,
4219540	4223540	but I don't think fans and gamers in general, who as noted at the start,
4223540	4227540	probably welcome innovative projects, would be put off by this creation.
4227540	4231540	I think it's a natural outcome with fan-made content, some of it's gonna be pretty good,
4231540	4234540	and others will leave a bit to be desired.
4234540	4237540	The difference with Hunt Down the Freeman was its scale, and with that,
4237540	4242540	the game just transformed itself into a meme that transcends simple categorisation.
4242540	4247540	At the centre of the story, a man who comparably rises above the realms of human understanding,
4247540	4252540	embodying the purest form of dream-stimulated idealism, a driving force behind a vision.
4252540	4258540	In spite of that vision's many imperfections, he made it happen, for better and for worse.
4258540	4261540	Some may not acknowledge the true influence that he exhibited,
4261540	4265540	but there is no way that this game would have existed without his presence.
4265540	4270540	It seems quite improbable that the Hunt Down the Freeman franchise will bring us a sequel,
4270540	4273540	and the developers have confirmed this also, many have moved on,
4273540	4276540	and probably would be difficult to convince to return.
4276540	4280540	There is a parody account that claims to be carrying the baton of the franchise forward,
4280540	4284540	though I wouldn't hold my breath. Every now and then, the company Twitter will post a meme,
4284540	4289540	or share an interaction, they even mention their community, which is an attainment in itself.
4289540	4294540	I doubt there'll be many new updates, and it seems the team has embraced the meme status since,
4294540	4297540	but if you really want to see where it is now, it's $8 on Steam,
4297540	4301540	which may still be a bit overpriced, especially when you can buy Among Us,
4301540	4307540	but it's your money. If you buy it after this video, and find out it's not the life-changing experience you'd hope for,
4307540	4309540	then that may be on you.
4309540	4312540	If you want to play a recently released critically acclaimed Half-Life game,
4312540	4317540	and have the resources, then Half-Life Alyx came out this year for virtual reality consoles.
4317540	4320540	It also covers events in between the first two games in the series,
4320540	4324540	so clearly the developers must have been inspired by our good friend Birkin.
4324540	4328540	I've expected Alyx to pop up in front of me, and save me from this shit game.
4328540	4332540	It's hard to say exactly what Valve has in store for the Half-Life franchise,
4332540	4338540	and with investment from many in its universe, it's natural that some want to offer their own contributions,
4338540	4342540	but making a video game or a mod is more than just aspiration,
4342540	4345540	it's about knowledge, ability, and experience,
4345540	4347540	and filling your goals with mind to them.
4347540	4351540	Equally, if it's just your mod, then have a blast, it's your life,
4351540	4354540	but if you're going to involve other people, and make promises to them,
4354540	4356540	remember what they're giving up as well,
4356540	4360540	and do your best to honour it with your own talent and commitment.
4360540	4362540	Otherwise, you may end up with this.
4362540	4366540	And believe me, we will live to fight another day.
4366540	4369540	We shall return.
4369540	4375540	God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.
4375540	4378540	Few things are certain in the story of Half-Life.
4378540	4381540	However, there is one thing I can guarantee.
4381540	4385540	That being, that I am a gamer.
4385540	4387540	So stop doubting my credentials for fun-
4387540	4389540	CLAP
4389540	4390540	CLAP
4390540	4393540	So yes, that was the video, I hope you enjoyed,
4393540	4396540	I want to give a big thanks to my editors,
