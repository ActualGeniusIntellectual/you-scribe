00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,680
Have you guys ever browsed Instagram and wondered why everyone looks so beautiful?

2
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,880
Why does everyone have such a perfect life?

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,540
I'll tell you why!

4
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:16,040
Because they're faking it!

5
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:17,040
No!

6
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,040
No!

7
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:21,360
That cannot be the same person!

8
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,440
Dude Coachella versus open casket funeral.

9
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:27,320
You said I look like a corpse in like an open casket funeral.

10
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,320
Yeah, you did!

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,560
Well, my friends, here we are.

12
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:37,480
They said it would never happen, me and Trisha making a podcast and frankly, I thought they

13
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:38,480
were right.

14
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:44,000
But let me explain, first of all, how what brings us to here, which is a pairing of very

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
bizarre.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,200
I've been wanting to make a podcast with like another comedian for a while and I don't mean

17
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,520
that to compliment you.

18
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,520
I think I mean like two big personalities and in my mind, when I kept trying to think

19
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,300
of people to do it with, I always thought, you know, me and Trisha have a really funny

20
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:03,560
chemistry and I thought, well, you know, fuck it, let's just do it like that.

21
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,560
Let's do a live.

22
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,560
Fuck it!

23
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,560
All right, we're done.

24
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:12,760
Thank you guys.

25
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,640
We shouldn't have got pizza.

26
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:20,780
Hello, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the right opinion, the home of a twat with

27
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:25,660
too much free time and podcasts, something that I have a bit of a patchy record on.

28
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:29,320
In principle, there's always something enjoyable about being able to present a more raw version

29
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:33,460
of yourself, being able to speak casually without having to filter your mind so rigorously.

30
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:37,360
It's also a less demanding job in many regards, and although the result is never identical,

31
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,860
you can go into recording with a clear idea of who you're presenting to the audience.

32
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:44,820
For me, I guess I'll always be someone who requires the rehearsed nature of scripts to

33
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,220
maximize my full potential.

34
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:50,480
And although I'm not adverse to making appearances on podcasts here and there, I think I need

35
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:54,440
to focus my efforts on my content first and foremost, given how I have regularly failed

36
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,680
to do that of recent.

37
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,160
However, it is a thought that has taken up residence in my psyche.

38
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,640
What if I was to drop everything I was doing now, set up a new channel with the resources

39
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,740
I currently possess, and do something that doesn't require me tearing my hair out?

40
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:10,920
In a way, it's a decision that Ethan and Eda Klein, also known as H3H3 Productions,

41
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:14,980
made a few years ago when they decided to launch the H3 podcast, but let's rewind for

42
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:19,740
just a moment in case anyone here is not fully equated with the YouTuber Viathan that is

43
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:20,740
H3H3 Productions.

44
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:25,100
Game assassins out there, you think I was born looking this cool?

45
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:29,380
No, I used to look like you, losing to noobs every day.

46
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:34,540
That is until I discovered gamer gear that got my fashion on point, and I never lose

47
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:36,100
to noobs anymore.

48
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:40,500
Gamer gear glasses, help you see the game and look cooler than ever.

49
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,220
And our trademark item, gamer water.

50
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:44,900
Dude, fuck yeah, man.

51
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:49,180
H3H3 Productions is the YouTube channel run by the aforementioned Klein couple.

52
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:53,020
They established a presence on YouTube for content that often parodied their subjects,

53
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:57,180
usually utilising Ethan's offbeat sense of humour, alongside editing that put a somewhat

54
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:00,020
amusingly absurdist twist on the content they were lampooning.

55
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:03,780
Nonetheless, many of these videos also had an underlying moral message that resonated

56
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:07,660
with many viewers, often calling out many of the creators of their time for their often

57
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,780
shallow exploitation of YouTube culture.

58
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:13,780
They're funny, they're well made, and many of them are still relevant to this day.

59
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:17,540
They're videos I grew up with and will always find a place in my heart for, however a few

60
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:20,900
years ago, as many of you probably know, they themselves became the centre of attention

61
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:24,300
after one of the subjects of their videos, a gentleman by the name of Matt Hoss, decided

62
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,820
to sue them for copyright infringement.

63
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:30,140
It had been regularly debated on how much commentary constituted fair use, and with

64
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:34,380
H3's videos there was an uneasy trepidation that maybe, if the ruling went in favour of

65
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:39,340
the plaintiff, that a new gauntlet would be set down for further lawsuits in this domain.

66
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:42,780
Fortunately the case was won by our protagonists here, and they triumphantly returned to the

67
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:46,980
platform, cheered on by the platform itself and many creators whose livelihoods seemed

68
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:50,820
to depend on the verdict, however you can't really undo the stress that such a case would

69
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:54,380
cause you, and in the aftermath it seemed difficult to return to that content with the

70
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:57,820
same sort of gusto that they'd previously bought, and it's hard to blame them.

71
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:01,260
If anything, a lawsuit which required such an investment would inevitably sap the fun

72
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:05,220
out of the content that in many ways served as an escape at one point, so over time they

73
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:08,940
seemed to distance themselves further from the formula they had once been inseparable

74
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:12,560
from, venturing into new pastures, including the one we mentioned earlier.

75
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,560
The Podcast

76
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:36,840
The H3 Podcast was founded on the 8th of April 2017, with the first episode being broadcast

77
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:40,240
on the same day, a few months before the lawsuit was settled.

78
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,680
This format seemed rather unexceptional on the surface, Ethan would bring on a guest,

79
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,060
often someone with a pretty well established media presence, sometimes a real A-list celebrity,

80
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,060
and they would shoot the shit.

81
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:52,440
It's a concept that's been tried and tested over and over again, and although not always

82
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:57,400
yielding groundbreaking results, you'd typically expect it to be a mostly uncontroversial formula,

83
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,560
and at the start it certainly was, but then something began to happen.

84
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:27,160
I think in a way it's a peril with any commentator that has a tendency to say what's on their

85
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:31,940
mind at a specific moment, but something about H3 in the podcast environment didn't

86
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:35,240
always hit the best notes for certain viewers, and fellow creators.

87
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:38,100
There were moments that just seemed a bit out of step for his image, and eventually

88
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:41,960
people began to express their frustration which generated controversy in itself.

89
00:05:41,960 --> 00:06:09,880
Now, H3 often did take time to address specific dramas, even occasionally admitting their

90
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:13,520
flaws and shortcomings, and pledging to do better, however they seemed to also have

91
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,940
an inexorable nature to be drawn towards the flame of conflict, and this is where we introduce

92
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:20,560
the second character in this convoluted story.

93
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,840
I feel like such a DIY right now.

94
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:29,000
If we can make this fattuccini pink I will be so happy.

95
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,120
So I'm just gonna go ahead and, hopefully don't get this all over me.

96
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,840
I don't know what food coloring really tastes like.

97
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,060
I don't think it's supposed to have a taste?

98
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:42,080
Whoa, first of all, it's sporting literally everywhere.

99
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,320
Can't relate.

100
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:48,600
This looks more red, but the cap is pink.

101
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:54,860
Okay, we're gonna try and not... This looks like... not appetizing.

102
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:58,740
This is Trisha Paytas, they are a veteran creator and no stranger to this channel.

103
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:03,860
It's difficult to talk about what they do at length, because they tend to be more of a YouTube socialite at this point,

104
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:09,260
renowned for their own involvement with the platformer elites and dramas that these dynamics occasionally precipitate.

105
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:12,860
They're outspoken, often unapologetic, and quite unpredictable.

106
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:18,220
In many ways, they're not the prime candidate for the co-host of a podcast that seems to be trying to clean up its act.

107
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:24,560
In many ways, they were the polar opposite of someone like Ethan who seemed to care deeply about his public image, and yet...

108
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,900
Ethan- Well, my friends, here we are. They said it would never happen.

109
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:35,460
It happened. In fact, its life cycle was longer than many probably predicted, with a total episode count just shy of 40.

110
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:40,740
However, to nobody's surprise, there was still no lack of fireworks, and even when the podcast soared to its highest peaks,

111
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:44,720
it could only have forebode its inevitable demise, and yet it didn't even end there.

112
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,300
In fact, it seems to have only escalated.

113
00:07:47,300 --> 00:08:13,420
There's a lot more to the story of H3 and Trish's relationship that underlines the characters of both parties involved,

114
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:17,180
a few that long existed and will long outlive many other dramas.

115
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:22,820
If you're interested in the story, then I suggest we follow it a little further, but to unravel the story in its entirety,

116
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:30,060
we need to first head back to 2019, where these two strangers first became acquainted, and sowed the seeds for their ill-fated podcasts.

117
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:34,060
Let's see how these frenemies became, well, friends and enemies.

118
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:41,940
But first, ad time. The following ad is region and age specific, so if you're under 21 or live outside the United States,

119
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:47,740
then this is unlikely to apply to you. The following ad also contains depictions of recreational drug use,

120
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:53,460
so if that's not your jam, you may want to skip to part two. For those who are still here, I hope you enjoy.

121
00:08:53,460 --> 00:09:14,060
Okay, guys. I need a video done by tomorrow. Does anyone have an idea right now? Anyone?

122
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:17,100
Lenuski. I need an idea now, Lenuski.

123
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:25,060
All right, yeah, that's cool. I have like a few dozen of them. All right, so because kale is like a superfood and we want to like lean into that element,

124
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:30,820
since, you know, the product is kale, I feel like we could capitalize off of like the Marvel Cinematic Universe,

125
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:37,820
so like induce like a lot of the super based puns and whatnot. And then that way we can appeal to all the children and their dads who never grew up.

126
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:44,740
Do you seriously think we're going to do a video about kale?

127
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:49,540
Will you hit me again if I say yes? Shut the fuck up and get out.

128
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:57,540
What the fuck do you think you're doing? Get the fuck out, right? I need more ideas. Aubrey, give me an idea now.

129
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:03,460
An idea for the video. Aubrey, idea now. Video idea.

130
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:09,380
Okay, so hear me out. So the Minecraft dream, right? So he's green, like the product for the sponsor.

131
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:15,060
So they kind of tie in together. Dream, green, kind of rhyme. So we got the green, green fans and the dream fans.

132
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:19,980
You know, a lot of people like dream and the color green. So I think it ties in together nicely, wouldn't you say?

133
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:27,380
Yeah, yeah. Do you think that's a good idea? It's a shit idea, right?

134
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:33,900
Yeah. Do you want to say that idea again? I don't think I do.

135
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:42,780
Okay, so I was thinking we could make a video on experimental cloud rapper, Blady, because he smokes weed all the time.

136
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:48,500
I don't have a fucking clue what the fuck you're talking about. Does anyone know what he's talking about?

137
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:55,900
It's Blady. Blade. Blade. Blade. It's a strange game, guys.

138
00:10:55,900 --> 00:11:03,380
Another idea, now. Alright, so we make a video on experimental cloud rapper Echo2K.

139
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:10,860
Who the fuck is 2K Mecco? I don't want any more SoundCloud rappers from your mouth.

140
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:25,380
We make a video on experimental hip hop.

141
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:31,580
Coach, you better fucking have an idea. It's now you.

142
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:37,380
Oh, make it good. Please make it good. A lot of the stuff we get is like shit that happens on Twitter.

143
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:41,060
Like if someone getting canceled, maybe you could go with that. You know, people need that.

144
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:50,100
And who should we cancel? Alright, hear me out. Maybe, maybe, maybe Tro gets into some shit and like,

145
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:59,100
what's the contents around that? I feel like this is out of my, like, I might kill someone right now.

146
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:05,100
I don't think you should go that far. We kind of need him. It's Tro. Okay.

147
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:18,100
Hello? Yeah. Yeah, okay. Cold. Yeah. Basement.

148
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:27,100
Okay. Kind of you. Thank you. You're off in there!

149
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:35,100
Five minutes. Five minutes.

150
00:12:48,100 --> 00:13:17,100
You know what? I think I got it.

151
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:28,100
Oh yeah? What about a four hour video on Frenemies?

152
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:35,100
Whether you're looking for a good time with friends, creatively drained like my indentured servants, or just looking to relax,

I love you too, Deckard. I'm sorry.

160
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:31,100
2019 was a curious year for H3. Emerging from the drama of the previous 12 months, they had maintained a pretty strong

161
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:36,100
upload schedule on both their podcast and their main channel. These videos certainly didn't evoke the energy of the

162
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:41,100
main channel's supposed heyday, but the truth is that times have changed, and so have they. However, one video

163
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:46,100
seemed to be a departure from not only their previous content, but in my opinion, their channel as a whole.

164
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:51,100
Comedy has certainly evolved on YouTube, particularly in the last few years. There's a lot of talk about what jokes one

165
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:55,100
can and can't make these days, and although there's definitely been a clamp down on certain creators in the

166
00:14:55,100 --> 00:15:01,100
commentary genre, there are still liberties you can take, and on the 8th of May 2019, I'd say H3H3 Productions

167
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:05,100
exercised those with a video named Instagram vs Reality.

168
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:11,100
Have you ever browsed Instagram and wondered why everyone looks so beautiful? Why does everyone have such a perfect life?

169
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:16,100
Why is everyone having so much fun, has perfect skin, is always laughing and smiling?

170
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:23,100
Why is my life so boring as I sit here in my underwear covered in breadcrumbs, sad and alone?

171
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:28,100
Why? I'll tell you why. Because they're faking it. That is not you.

172
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:32,100
The one on the left is on the beach, the one on the right just washed up on the beach.

173
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,100
Oh damn, Tana's looking pretty good these days.

174
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,100
Oh.

175
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:42,100
I can't believe it's the same day. She looks like a Twinkie.

176
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:47,100
Now as the title implies, it's about how many individuals tend to airbrush and edit their content to make it conform

177
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:52,100
more with society's superficial standards surrounding beauty. On the surface, this is quite a progressive message,

178
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:57,100
and there's nothing overtly wrong with calling that out. The video itself doesn't pull any punches when addressing

179
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:03,100
these individuals who are thought to be participating in these shenanigans, one of those in particular being Trisha Paytas.

180
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:09,100
This girl tried to use a face filter on Instagram and her phone blew up. There's another one of her.

181
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:15,100
Ah, she is the best. Isn't she not the best? Would people even recognize her if they saw her on the street?

182
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:21,100
I mean, she is unrecognizable. This is Coachella vs throwing down in the McDonald's parking lot at 3am.

183
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:29,100
This is Coachella vs World Star Hip Hop. No, that cannot be the same person.

184
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:33,100
Dude, Coachella vs open casket funeral.

185
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:38,100
I have a lot of thoughts on this video as a whole, but I don't think it's necessary to the story we're constructing.

186
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:43,100
All I will say is that at the time, regardless of Trisha's own reputation, this video did draw a bit of backlash.

187
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:48,100
I think the main reason is because although it is completely fair to attack society's beauty standards and those who prop it up,

188
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:52,100
attacking that person's appearance somewhat undermines the message in people's eyes,

189
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:56,100
because then you yourself are using those standards as a stepping stone for your own point against it,

190
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,100
which seems somewhat contradictory.

191
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:02,100
How you interrupt the video ultimately comes down to what you think of these people's intent,

192
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:07,100
whether they are just another victim of unattainable beauty standards or they're knowingly contributing to that toxicity.

193
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:14,100
If we want commentary on Trisha's own intent, however, we are guaranteed to at least receive it from one source, Trisha themselves.

194
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:21,100
Don't understand that there's so many more things that go into it than just stop eating, start exercising, stop being lazy.

195
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,100
That is so much more to it.

196
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:30,100
Oh my God, if people could even understand 10% of the mental struggles that a lot of overweight people go through.

197
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:35,100
And I'm going to speak on myself, like, if you could even be inside this head for like a minute, a minute,

198
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:41,100
and to see why I use food as like a coping mechanism, like, and it sucks.

199
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:46,100
Now, Trisha had already responded once to Ethan's comments the previous year relating to society's beauty standards

200
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:49,100
when H3 had made comments surrounding the model test holiday.

201
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:55,100
It was clear that there was some disparity between the opinions each held about how they think the matter should be approached,

202
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:59,100
but with the crosshairs shifted towards Trisha, the spotlight was firmly on them to respond.

203
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:04,100
Trisha first put out a series of tweets that attacked H3H3 for their video, calling it predatory and harmful,

204
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:07,100
and labelling Klein a disgusting piece of shysa.

205
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:12,100
Nevertheless, of the belief that such tweets were not sufficient retribution for the Klein's misdemeanors,

206
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:19,100
Trisha uploaded a video, further chastising H3H3 for their comments and depiction of sensitive issues that could impact many young girls growing up.

207
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:36,100
In very typical Trisha fashion, it takes whatever valid criticism or responses could be made

208
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:40,100
and blows them wildly out of proportion. Additionally, it meshes a variety of points together,

209
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:44,100
including technical points about whether the photos Ethan compared were taken on the same day,

210
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:48,100
or more emotional points about how this has affected them and other vulnerable individuals.

211
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:55,100
You're not taking something from that day and showing it from a video clip in the same hair and makeup,

212
00:18:55,100 --> 00:19:02,100
you're taking all my photos he showed. One he showed a side by side was one I posted myself to show how different

213
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:09,100
My whole point of that post was to be like, yes, I can be glam and I feel good about myself and also I can be like how I was looking and just like selfie down,

214
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:16,100
like not the most attractive and I was doing that to show like, yes, to show what I guess he was trying to prove,

215
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:22,100
but he did that in such a way of like, it was bullying. It really, really upset me. It really upset me.

216
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:28,100
It's not that I don't understand how such comments could upset someone like Trisha if they feel as vulnerable about their appearance as they present.

217
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:33,100
However, as a public figure, you're going to be the butt of these jokes, and Ethan's point, whether you agree with it or not,

218
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:37,100
is that all of our appearances are flawed, and that trying to cover it up is only going to do more harm.

219
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:41,100
This was a difference in perspective that neither side was going to compromise on,

220
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:44,100
because they both seemed to believe that they were starting from the righteous premise.

221
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:49,100
Trisha in empowering girls to post pictures of themselves online free from stigma from judgemental parties,

222
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:54,100
and Ethan in tearing down the unrealistic thresholds of natural beauty pushed by many of these people.

223
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:59,100
There was never going to be a compromise, yet it could have just ended here.

224
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:03,100
Instead though, not happy with the response their video was receiving, Trisha pursued the feud online,

225
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:07,100
once again escalating the comments, now directing them at Ethan's wife and child,

226
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:10,100
providing some invaluable couples counselling on their marriage as well.

227
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:15,100
Ethan, unfazed by these comments, continued to dunk on Trisha and the photoshop employing their content.

228
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:20,100
At this point, Ethan took the W, because he avoided taking the comments to the personal level that Trisha did,

229
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:25,100
and maintained his stance pretty staunchly. This is where the direct interaction appeared to end though,

230
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:29,100
with Ethan delivering a final address to it on his podcast a few days later.

231
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:56,100
First is, why are you on your kitchen floor? There's gotta be a better setting for this.

232
00:20:56,100 --> 00:21:00,100
Although brief, this exchange highlighted the contrasting dynamic shared between the two.

233
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:05,100
Trisha, a person who really behaves on that emotional whim, the person who will readily bear their teeth at those

234
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:08,100
that they wish to, and take their comments to places that many would consider beneath them.

235
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:13,100
Ethan, on the other hand, may make provocative content from time to time, but also has a grasp on his own opinions,

236
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:18,100
and in this case, maintain control of the conversation, not falling for the outrage base set by Trisha.

237
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:23,100
Trisha pages said before that they will often chase the behaviour that guards them the most attention,

238
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:28,100
but in this instance, they kinda hit that brick wall, where they didn't manage to elicit a rise out of their opponent.

239
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:33,100
With this in mind, barely a couple days after their explosive rage, their tune changed, and they began posting somewhat

240
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:37,100
strangely worded praise for Ethan, even asking if they could make an appearance on their podcast.

241
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:42,100
As far as I'm aware, at this point they had not collaborated, so this tweet may have been a bit tongue in cheek,

242
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:46,100
though I have to say I'm not sure where the tongue or the cheek are, but I digress.

243
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:51,100
This was the first time that Trisha had signaled interest in collaborating on the podcast with H3H3,

244
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:55,100
however this interest wasn't initially reciprocated by the clients who didn't respond to these tweets,

245
00:21:55,100 --> 00:22:00,100
and continued with their routine podcast schedule, seemingly paying no mind to Trisha and their antics.

246
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:04,100
However, if anyone thought this quarrel in question was quite quelled, well, they were in for a little shock.

247
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:10,100
That was an epic collab, I totally didn't anticipate it, like this came so out of left field,

248
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:15,100
but I think I enjoyed it, I think deep down she enjoyed it as well.

249
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:20,100
Something about Ethan's comedy and Trisha's desire for attention seemed to bring them together,

250
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:25,100
and as the capers continued to increment, these characters were set on a collision course that could not be averted.

251
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:41,100
Over the next few months, not too much of note happened, there was the occasional acknowledgement or mention of either party,

252
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:47,100
but otherwise it seemed that this had mostly cooled, however all this changed when Trish decided to post a video coming out as transgender.

253
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:54,100
So, in my head I feel like I'm a transgender female to male, but also like a drag queen.

254
00:22:54,100 --> 00:23:02,100
That's kind of how I've like rationalised it in my head, because like, okay, let me just tell you why I identify as a boy more so,

255
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:10,100
and from an early age. I don't like to be centre of attention, except when I want to be centre of attention.

256
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:16,100
Once again, I think we can keep this relatively brief, but this video was met with a lot of controversy for how it handled the subject matter

257
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:20,100
and the communities that it references, regardless of whether Trisha truly was transgender.

258
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:25,100
The day after, in light of the less than supportive response, Trisha posted an apology video,

259
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:27,100
which unfortunately seems to have been lost to the sands of time.

260
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:32,100
This was once again received fairly poorly, and provoked another response on the 8th Street Podcast.

261
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:40,100
She just kind of describes like a lot of people, she says, I don't know, some days I don't wear makeup and I just wear comfy clothes.

262
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:42,100
Trans, that means she's trans.

263
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:49,100
I really relate to men, and I like to hang out with men more than women, and so therefore she thinks she's a guy.

264
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:53,100
So take a guess what happens next, I'm telling you, it will shock you.

265
00:23:53,100 --> 00:24:01,100
Trisha took to Twitter to insult Ethan, however in a twist, this time posting some rather sensitive images that we shan't go into detail about.

266
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:05,100
Ethan responds fairly unamused, and then Trisha brings up Ela like clockwork.

267
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:08,100
Oh, and what would a situation be without a Trisha video?

268
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:16,100
Apparently she came out recently as a trans male, so I guess she would know something about s**t.

269
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:19,100
Although I bet you Trisha's got a large s**t that's bigger than my s**t.

270
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,100
Hell yeah I do.

271
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:24,100
She's got one of those weird girls, she's got like an engorged s**t.

272
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:28,100
It is a meaty, I have a meaty ass s**t.

273
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:35,100
It is so meaty and tight, it's like biting into an Arby's roast beef sandwich without the beef curtains.

274
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:39,100
However this time, instead of the dispute dying a death like the previous altercation,

275
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:45,100
Ethan responded to the Twitter publication of the video by inviting them on the podcast, if they were man enough.

276
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:50,100
At first Trisha, seeming hesitant to commit, requests an advance payment of $18 million,

277
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:53,100
a fairly regular sum for most H3 guests, I'm sure.

278
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:56,100
However, Ethan calls Trisha on their bluff, stating that they'll do it for free.

279
00:24:56,100 --> 00:25:03,100
Chief negotiator Trisha then makes a minor amendment to the condition, stating that they may appear if Ethan apologizes for all his dumbass trolling,

280
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:06,100
something which Trisha is obviously a stranger to.

281
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:11,100
A few days later, on the 16th of October, Ethan uploads another video which includes a parody apology to Trisha,

282
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:16,100
mocking their often melodramatic setup, providing the implication that negotiations had perhaps broken down.

283
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:25,100
I wanted to basically apologize to Trisha Paytas, who is such a sweet, genuine person,

284
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:33,100
and I just really, like, I wanted to first of all apologize for saying that she looked like she was at an open casket funeral,

285
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:36,100
like she was the corpse inside of a casket.

286
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:41,100
That's not true, that's just not what I meant at all, you're so beautiful, you're such a queen.

287
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:49,100
And I also wanted to apologize for saying that you have, like, a 5 to 10 inch engorged clit that's bigger than my dick.

288
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:55,100
I mean, that would basically make you a guy, that would basically mean you had a penis,

289
00:25:55,100 --> 00:26:02,100
and, well, I guess I'm kind of confused because you said you're trans, I don't know, I just am sorry, I don't want to offend you.

290
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:13,100
I'm sorry for saying that you're not trans, man, even though you have, like, cup f jugs that are always on display.

291
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:19,100
With the unpredictability of Trisha, it would be normal to assume that this interaction would fizzle out like many others had.

292
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:24,100
However, in a surprise turn of events, approximately a fortnight later, a photo was posted on Twitter

293
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:29,100
that showed the two parties together alongside a link to Trisha's debut on the H3 podcast.

294
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:34,100
Well, first of all, Trisha Paytas is here, are we here to squash the beef or roast the beef?

295
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:42,100
Ooh, I would love to squash it, but I like you guys talking about me, so maybe we'll roast more.

296
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,100
That's what I figured, thank you for saying that.

297
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:48,100
It's now a half of the two parties addressing and appearing to mostly settle their differences.

298
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:54,100
On the one hand, Trisha handles themselves pretty well, in fact responding to certain questions with a degree of eloquence not typically associated with them,

299
00:26:54,100 --> 00:27:00,100
such as certain gender-related queries, where their responses actually add a lot of nuance to their prior content on the matter.

300
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:06,100
A lot of people are transphobic, me coming out transgender is not gonna help my dating life, it's not gonna, why would I put that on myself?

301
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:12,100
I'm trying to date, I'm trying to get married, why would I put that out there just so people can look up that I'm a transgender if I truly don't believe that?

302
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:17,100
It always fascinates me how the internet can be surprisingly hostile to those who may just be expressing confusion,

303
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:22,100
and although Trisha did make some insensitive comments, their confusion was nothing to write off on their own basis.

304
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:25,100
In fact, I think many only responded the way they did because it's Trisha.

305
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:29,100
The podcast allowed them to make their own defence, and I think that was a positive thing.

306
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:33,100
On the other hand though, it kinda reminds me of James Merritt's interview with Nikocado Avocado.

307
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:39,100
You appear to have two parties engaging in casual conversation, however when you know both parties relatively well,

308
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:43,100
particularly Trisha, you begin to pick up on certain details that others may overlook.

309
00:27:43,100 --> 00:28:01,100
In this part Trisha says they go to Israel all the time, which just isn't true.

310
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:07,100
It's such a trivial detail to lie about, so trivial that you don't feel like it's worth even pulling them up on it.

311
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:11,100
When it comes to other points though, Trisha was caught with their trousers down.

312
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:15,100
I'm not trying to expose anything that's private, but...

313
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:17,100
It's all demonetised.

314
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:24,100
Hold on, hold on, hold on. Where is it? Apology, and then it's coming up regarding my...

315
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:31,100
I am transgender, 3 million views, green icon, monetised, and I'm gonna tell you exactly how much money she made.

316
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:34,100
She made $8,000 for that video!

317
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:39,100
It's a fascinating watch in many ways because it outlined that character that Trisha Paytas has cultivated,

318
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:42,100
and places it in an environment where it can receive direct scrutiny.

319
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:48,100
I do want to save some analysis for the end of the video, but it certainly illuminates how differently Trisha views the consequence

320
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:51,100
of their own language and behaviour in comparison to a lot of other creators.

321
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:56,100
However, this podcast appearance wouldn't be possible without two people, namely Ethan and Hila.

322
00:28:57,100 --> 00:29:01,100
I mean, clearly not all men are violent, I mean, like that.

323
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:02,100
But some are.

324
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:08,100
And a lot are cheaters, a lot are perverts, a lot of underage girls, like, yeah.

325
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:16,100
So do you, are you ever afraid that it might be that your choices drive these bad characters into your life?

326
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:18,100
My choices is how?

327
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:20,100
And men. The men you're attracted to.

328
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:23,100
I feel like I date everybody, like anybody who wants to date me, I'll date them.

329
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:27,100
So I feel like I don't, I'm not picky, I just date whoever wants to date me.

330
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:33,100
So maybe the image you put out to the world attracts the wrong kind of guy.

331
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:36,100
I've heard that. Oh my god, this is like therapy now.

332
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:37,100
Oh my god, it's so deep.

333
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:40,100
You are like a dad, even though you're only 34, you're like a 45 year old dad.

334
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:41,100
I am a dad.

335
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:46,100
Ethan has the energy of an accommodating yet critical host, and although patronising and slightly presumptive at points,

336
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:49,100
he doesn't just endlessly grill Trisha like some probably would.

337
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:53,100
He lets them say their peace and challenges when he feels necessary, catching them out a few times.

338
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:57,100
At the same time, there's this still somewhat standoffish nature between the two parties,

339
00:29:57,100 --> 00:30:01,100
particularly with Ela's presence, who still seems somewhat sceptical towards Trisha,

340
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:04,100
and their nature to fluctuate between flirtatious and insulting towards Ethan.

341
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:07,100
I love that we're on a three-way date right now, we're like eating and talking.

342
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:11,100
We're like coffee. Ethan is the worst, I have to say that.

343
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,100
You're kind of just the worst. I think Ela...

344
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:18,100
Wait, hold on, so you hated me, you came in liking me more, but now you hate me again.

345
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:22,100
It's a mesmerising experience, these two internet veterans dissecting an individual

346
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:27,100
who has in many ways occupied the spotlight for so long, yet seldom been understood by those attacking them.

347
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:31,100
By the end of the podcast, although it felt like any dispute had been placated,

348
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:34,100
you weren't really sure if there were seeds for a future relationship.

349
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:39,100
Some tension in the air still lingered, and with everything in mind, that was to be expected.

350
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:45,100
But somewhere deep down, there was the potential for something truly great, and I think people knew that.

351
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:53,100
As I mentioned at the start, Klein had been involved in a fair bit of drama relating to how he handled himself on the podcast,

352
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:55,100
but also how he interacted with guests.

353
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:58,100
And he also had a zillion kids, so I mean, yeah.

354
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,100
Really? How many siblings do you have?

355
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:02,100
I don't know, dude. The internet's too fucking weird to give out all that information.

356
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:06,100
Oh, you don't even want to say how many, because you're afraid that it will not compromise your privacy.

357
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:09,100
Yeah, by all means, keep talking about it. Is there anybody who can cut this out?

358
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,100
I'm honest, dude.

359
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:11,100
Seriously?

360
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:13,100
Yeah, no, dude. Yeah, there's fucking lunatics out there.

361
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:14,100
Okay.

362
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,100
Well...

363
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:16,100
Off the air, off the air, I'll tell you.

364
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:17,100
Alright.

365
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,100
Jeez.

366
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:25,100
There were a lot of theories as to why this was, but many at the time were under the impression that he was not a naturally talented podcast host,

367
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:28,100
particularly when he appeared with certain people, and that's completely fine.

368
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:35,100
The transfer from video content that can be scripted and edited to a podcast where you really have to devote your full attention towards each and every moment

369
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:37,100
can be an exceptionally difficult one.

370
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:44,100
However, sometimes it's about who you're doing the podcast with, and Trisha Paytas was someone that you never ran out of questions for,

371
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:49,100
and if you're an inquisitive person like Klein is in a way, then it was quite easy to maintain and engage in conversation,

372
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:52,100
even if it does seem more like a case study at points.

373
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:56,100
It doesn't taste like anything to me. The squid I got is like a transparent squid, so it just doesn't taste like anything.

374
00:31:56,100 --> 00:32:01,100
It was a wild goal. I mean, I used to eat like goldfish as a kid, I used to like swallow goldfish, so I don't think you're supposed to do that either.

375
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:03,100
But I would just eat the fish out of the bowl.

376
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:04,100
Why would you do that?

377
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:07,100
I don't know, I thought it was honestly food. I was young, I was like five.

378
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:13,100
For a while it seemed like this was the most confab we were going to see, as the two turned back towards their own ventures over the following months,

379
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:18,100
until the start of 2020 that is, when they returned to the podcast for another session of antics.

380
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:19,100
I love this.

381
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:21,100
So it is like a throuple.

382
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:24,100
It's not a throuple. It's definitely not a throuple.

383
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:26,100
I think of it like parents, but now I think of it like a throuple.

384
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:28,100
I feel like this because me and Hila are getting along good.

385
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:30,100
Please don't think of it as a throuple.

386
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:32,100
It's like a little date right now.

387
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:34,100
Definitely not a date.

388
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:40,100
One of the constant struggles that Trisha has been quite open about on her channel is their often fruitless endeavour to find a relationship,

389
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:48,100
and during their appearances on the two episodes of the podcast, Trisha had a nature to make certain comments that seemed to seek validation for intimacy with those they were around.

390
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:55,100
These include the numerous rather pointed flirtatious remarks towards Ethan, and referring to the podcast's collective presence as a throuple.

391
00:32:55,100 --> 00:33:00,100
Ethan and Hila weren't completely sold in this dynamic though, and had their own plans for Trisha going forward.

392
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:05,100
The year prior, the clients had conducted a dating game of sorts with an individual known as Ian the Intern,

393
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:09,100
where they would peruse dating profiles and attempt to set him up with some lovely ladies.

394
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:16,100
They compared this setup to the show The Bachelor, a show that I am unfortunately completely oblivious to, and have very little interest in learning about.

395
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:22,100
Unfortunately, Ian seemed to undermine the show when he messaged one of the participants, and then decided that he didn't want her to come on the show.

396
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:27,100
Nonetheless, the concept was a hit with the audience, so clearly the clients thought they would bring it back for season two,

397
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:31,100
this time branding it as The Bachelorette with You Know Who in the starring role.

398
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:42,100
I brought Trisha back here, and the reason that Trisha's joining us today is, as you all know, Ian's had a season of The Bachelor, with an H3 instead of a...

399
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:45,100
It's a capital H in a three, Bachelor.

400
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:49,100
And so Ian actually found true love on his season.

401
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:56,100
We had some ups and downs, we had some controversies, but in the end, Ian has been dating a girl for how long, Ian?

402
00:33:57,100 --> 00:34:00,100
For about, since last September around there, October.

403
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:02,100
Since last September, Hila came through.

404
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,100
Wow.

405
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:05,100
So he's in love.

406
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:06,100
And he met up on the show?

407
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:08,100
Yes. So the show worked.

408
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:10,100
Wow, I didn't know this.

409
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:11,100
The show worked.

410
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:12,100
Oh, I had no idea this was a thing.

411
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:24,100
And so we take this very seriously, love is very important to me and Hila, and our community, and we thought, Trisha Paytas, now that's the next season of The Bachelorette.

412
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:29,100
With so many eligible young gentlemen falling at their feet, it was clear that Trisha was spoiled for choice.

413
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:32,100
However, Trisha seemed to have eyes for one person in particular.

414
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:39,100
I thought, I don't know if I can say this, and you can cut it if I'm not supposed to say this, but I was low-key hoping,

415
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:44,100
because originally I was expecting the idea to come on as a contestant, and Hila's brother is going to be The Bachelor,

416
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:46,100
and then I thought maybe he would apply to be on My Bachelorette.

417
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:48,100
He was supposed to, I don't know what happened.

418
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:50,100
He said that he wanted to apply.

419
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,100
I found it on Instagram, it's fine.

420
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:53,100
We could take a last minute submission.

421
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:56,100
He said he wanted to, I think he's honestly super busy.

422
00:34:56,100 --> 00:35:02,100
He's like a fucking mega, hard, he's like a, he should make time though, right?

423
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,100
He should make time.

424
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,100
He should make time.

425
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:06,100
He looks so hot, I was like low-key impressed.

426
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:07,100
I was like, holy shit.

427
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:09,100
Like he's strikingly hot.

428
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:10,100
Okay, we'll make sure.

429
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:11,100
This is Moses Ackman.

430
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:17,100
He's an Israeli-born artist and architect who is relevant enough to have his own Wikipedia page, so that must mean something.

431
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:22,100
He is best known for his work Faces of Water which uses an artistic technique involving liquid iron,

432
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:28,100
all in all he seems like a reasonably talented artist who possesses some prestige in his field of operation.

433
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:34,100
However, he is also the brother of Hila Klein, and a Bachelorette entrant that Trisha seemed quite drawn towards.

434
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:39,100
Trisha had been known to have a somewhat strange interest towards humans of Jewish background,

435
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:44,100
and therefore it was probably not particularly surprising given their reputation that they liked Moses.

436
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:49,100
However, it was still a strange dynamic, and one that Hila at least didn't seem too eager to foster.

437
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:16,100
We'll get- we'll get Moses in here too.

438
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:16,600
Now-

439
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,100
Moses!

440
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:18,100
That's his name, yeah.

441
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:20,100
Fuck that name, that's crazy.

442
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:22,100
You better fucking Moses, holy shit.

443
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:23,100
And he looks like Jesus.

444
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:24,100
The hell of a thing.

445
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:26,100
Like, write the three commandments on my pussy.

446
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:28,100
Sorry, what was that?

447
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:29,100
What did she say?

448
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:30,100
I don't know.

449
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:32,100
Like, nevermind.

450
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:34,100
Nevermind, it's fine.

451
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:38,100
His name is Moses, he might spread your red seed.

452
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:39,100
Ooh!

453
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:40,100
Is he into that?

454
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:42,100
Yeah, he'll eat you out when you're on your period.

455
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:43,100
He's into that.

456
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:46,100
I don't want to see him right now, I wouldn't want to deal with him today.

457
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:52,100
The rules of The Bachelorette were set so that Trisha was advised against contacting any of the participants privately,

458
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:54,100
particularly with the season one incident in mind.

459
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:58,100
However, if they were to do so, there would be full disclosure with Ethan and Hila.

460
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:02,100
It seemed there was some understanding between everyone that would help make the show a success.

461
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:04,100
But then it happened.

462
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:05,100
Yes, lockdown.

463
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:07,100
Caused by our good old pathogenic friend.

464
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:13,100
And the H3 podcast was put on hold while they worked out a new arrangement compatible with the then present restrictions.

465
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:18,100
However, even if the H3 podcast was on hold, there was no stopping the Trisha show,

466
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:21,100
who decided that they had to take matters into their own hands.

467
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:26,100
And just over a month after the launch of The Bachelorette season two, it came to an abrupt end.

468
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:33,100
On her Instagram stories, in bed with somebody, and we see a hand, and I'm like...

469
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:37,100
Again, cryptic. I think that's his, I think it's his arm.

470
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:39,100
It looks like it.

471
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:40,100
It could be.

472
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:42,100
It definitely is.

473
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:46,100
But the evidence piles on as we continue forth here.

474
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:50,100
She posts pictures of, she says, quarantine date night.

475
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:53,100
Okay, now.

476
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:54,100
Okay.

477
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:55,100
So let's just, so okay.

478
00:37:55,100 --> 00:38:00,100
This is a separate day, so whoever this is, has come back to her house, a date night.

479
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:03,100
She calls it a date night, and whoever it is brought dinner.

480
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:07,100
Yes, on March the 23rd, Trisha posted pictures of them with Moses,

481
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:11,100
with the somewhat oxymoronic statement that they were social distancing together.

482
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:15,100
Ethan did not see the funny side of this, but Trisha continued to openly flaunt their rendezvous,

483
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:18,100
much to the dismay of Ackman's sister and her husband,

484
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:21,100
with them asserting that Trisha had ruined the show with their mischief.

485
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:26,100
I have to tell you that I don't know what he's up to.

486
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:27,100
Right.

487
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:29,100
This isn't some inside joke.

488
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:32,100
Look at the way he's looking at, so this is what Trisha posted.

489
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:33,100
Look at his face.

490
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:34,100
What is he doing?

491
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:36,100
It's like he's goofing on us.

492
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,100
Like, look.

493
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:38,100
Well, it's hard to tell.

494
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:40,100
Nice place, by the way, for Trisha.

495
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:41,100
Nice view.

496
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:42,100
You can't tell.

497
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:43,100
Hollywood Hills, by the way.

498
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:45,100
It could be just him smiling.

499
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:49,100
Bro, what are you doing?

500
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:51,100
What are you doing?

501
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:53,100
You know what's my biggest fear right now?

502
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:55,100
Is that this actually becomes serious.

503
00:38:55,100 --> 00:39:01,100
So both of these people promise me to keep bit 100 billion with me.

504
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:02,100
Yes, they promise.

505
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:04,100
Like, I'm most disappointed in your brother.

506
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:05,100
Trisha, whatever.

507
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:08,100
You know, we serve at her pleasure.

508
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:11,100
I mean, you don't know which personality you're showing up from which day.

509
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:13,100
I'm just happy when she comes in.

510
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:19,100
I mean, I expected her to work within the guidelines, too.

511
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:23,100
Your brother, though, is on our side, and now I don't know whose side he's on.

512
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:26,100
Needless to say, I can understand why the two were frustrated.

513
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:29,100
Notably, given that this was the second time this had happened.

514
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:32,100
However, when you're dealing with love, you can't really put a contract on it.

515
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:38,100
And this was going to be inevitable with something as loosely structured as The Bachelorette, and with someone like Trisha.

516
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:43,100
This was just not a great idea from the start, and the circumstances only exacerbated that.

517
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:48,100
Although in many ways Trisha was the perfect podcast guest, their appeal was also your Achilles heel.

518
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:51,100
They were not a person who was going to play by your rules.

519
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:56,100
So when you impose these sorts of expectations on them, then you need to manage your own expectations as well.

520
00:39:56,100 --> 00:40:02,100
That doesn't mean you can't find it frustrating, but it's somewhat inevitable when you deal with someone who you know is notoriously unpredictable.

521
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:07,100
H3 needed to think about this, but in the meantime, chaos reigned once more.

522
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:28,100
Although in a way it felt like Trisha was closer to the Klein's than they had ever been,

523
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:34,100
this only really intensified the tension between the creators, who openly criticised each other over the coming months.

524
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:40,100
In the meantime, to cement their commitment to the relationship, Trisha began learning Hebrew, and yes, uploading videos on the matter.

525
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:46,100
When the relationship was good, it was great, and the Klein's were trying to break an inseparable bond between soulmates,

526
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:51,100
and when the relationship wasn't working out, the Klein's were the cause of its demise. They really couldn't win.

527
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:21,100
Ethan and Hila seem to display some semblance of disapproval,

528
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:27,100
though I think there was a point where you have to begrudgingly accept that there is very little you can do to control a person like Trisha.

529
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:33,100
Trisha is someone who will put their own impulsive desires first, and will only play your game when they have a chance of winning,

530
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:36,100
and as Trisha said themselves, they won.

531
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:42,100
Of course so many people are like Trisha, you're not Jewish, and to that I say I was not born Jewish,

532
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:47,100
but I tend to gravitate towards Jewish people in my life, that have taught me a lot.

533
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:52,100
Once more, it went rather quiet for the next few months as the stalemates seemed to persist between the parties.

534
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:55,100
However, with everybody involved still one degree away from each other,

535
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:59,100
there was that sense that the dating show was far from the last we'd see of them together.

536
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:04,100
However, they'd really need a catalyst to bring them together. Who or what on earth could do that?

537
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:09,100
But the internet, there's nothing going on on the internet, so I decided to have you on anyways.

538
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:11,100
Sounds good to me.

539
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:15,100
Allow me to introduce two new guests to this very fun little house party.

540
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:18,100
Gabbie Hanna and our beloved Keemstar.

541
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:23,100
Gabbie Hanna is no stranger to controversy herself, and is a common talking boy for many commentators.

542
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:28,100
Her feud with Trisha Paytas is no less contentious, with Trisha accusing Gabbie of slander and harassment,

543
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:34,100
even threatening to take a restraining order out on her after she allegedly told Trisha's boyfriend Jason Nash that Trisha had herpes,

544
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:39,100
as explained in their now deleted video, Why I Don't Trust Gabbie Hanna.

545
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:43,100
When me and Jason started hooking up in 2017, I did a video called YouTubers I've Hooked Up With.

546
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:47,100
She, by the clues, guessed that I was hooking up with Jason. I was.

547
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:52,100
She texted Jason, and she told Jason, or I guess, I don't know if she texted him or told him in person,

548
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:58,100
but basically she told him, hey, be careful, Trisha has herpes and you're sleeping with her and blah blah blah.

549
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:14,100
Gabbie, have we slept together? Did I show you my STD results? Are you my doctor? Did you swab my vagina?

550
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:18,100
Gabbie did not debate that she had told Nash about the possibility of herpes,

551
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:21,100
and testified that she was merely warning a friend about certain health risks,

552
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:26,100
however she challenged the claims of harassment and stated Trisha was attempting to blackmail their mutual friends,

553
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:29,100
and since then any spirit of friendliness has been extinguished,

554
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:32,100
with Trisha making further videos asking Gabbie to leave them alone.

555
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:37,100
But it likely they're not chums, though some may be forgiven for thinking it's just another Pater's drama,

556
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:39,100
and there's nothing particularly exceptional about it.

557
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:45,100
Keemstar on the other hand, well honestly I would describe Ethan's attitude towards Keem quite exceptional,

558
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:46,100
at least for Ethan.

559
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:52,100
Keem, uh, clownstar, I know you're watching this because you're obsessed with me,

560
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:58,100
you're on every word and your blood is boiling, you're thinking to yourself, how am I going to destroy him?

561
00:43:58,100 --> 00:44:01,100
How am I going to make a Twitter rant and then find some shit?

562
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:04,100
This guy literally got it, I don't need to keep going on about Keemstar,

563
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:11,100
it's not the first time he's just made actually slanderous lies about me, but that is that.

564
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:17,100
Ethan and Keem have a long history on YouTube, mostly hostile, with the occasional ceasefire when a greater cause united them.

565
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:23,100
But at the start of 2020, H3 released three videos that sought to malign Keemstar from the platform once and for all,

566
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:26,100
even criticizing those who willingly associated with him.

567
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:30,100
Keemstar's got a bottle of G-Fuel somewhere in his house that's actually a horcrux.

568
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:32,100
How is G-Fuel still sponsored by this guy by the way?

569
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:37,100
G-Fuel brought to you by false pedophilia accusations!

570
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:38,100
Check out G-Fuel!

571
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:40,100
Get it now at Gfuel.com

572
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:46,100
Keemstar responded to these videos with his own perspective, framing Ethan as a dishonest opportunist hack and all-round hypocrite

573
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:49,100
who didn't really care about the issues that he was speaking about.

574
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:52,100
There are a lot of valid opinions that one can have about this mess of a drama,

575
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:56,100
however one thing I would probably say is that if you were familiar with either of the creators,

576
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:59,100
it was unlikely to change your opinion on them.

577
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:04,100
At its core, the videos were a showcase of how much these guys truly detested each other,

578
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:09,100
and this continued over the next few months, with nobody really emerging as a clear victor.

579
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:11,100
So what is the relevance to these two people?

580
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:15,100
Well you see, in September, bored as hell at the fact that there was no news,

581
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:20,100
Keemstar decided to invite Gabbie Hanna onto Drama Alert to talk about writing a diss track on Trish,

582
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:23,100
which as you can assume went down like a lead balloon with our good friend,

583
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:28,100
who sent multiple tweets to Keemstar for platforming those who they had deemed pieces of f***,

584
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:31,100
even going as far to imply that their life could be on the line over this matter.

585
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:36,100
Hey Keemstar, from one fat f*** to another, get your f*** together.

586
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:41,100
Don't blame Gabbie Hanna for my death because she's mentally ill, you have no idea why I had to hire 24 hour security,

587
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:47,100
you sick f***, you think bringing up drama is all fun and games until you're egging on a mentally ill person,

588
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:52,100
saying I'm star d***, saying I'm insatiation, I'm f***ing scared for my life, you dumb son of a b****.

589
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:57,100
Now it's hard to really establish a motive for why exactly Keemstar decided to have Gabbie come on Drama Alert,

590
00:45:57,100 --> 00:46:03,100
maybe he was genuinely bored, but Ethan appeared to back Trish's response, while continuing to speak ill of Keem.

591
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:06,100
Keemstar noticed these and subsequently went off on Twitter about it himself.

592
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:12,100
After this went nowhere, Keemstar reached out to Ethan offering a truce, framing it as the smartest thing to do.

593
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:19,100
In the coming months, more people were educated and they realised, oh wait, Keemstar's right, H3H3's a bad guy,

594
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:27,100
and now you're losing, and I'm winning, but the truth of the matter is that there's no winner, right?

595
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:34,100
We both lost, the lesser of the loser is not the winner. This is stupid.

596
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:39,100
And we're both going to continue to lose the more we fight.

597
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:43,100
And the smart thing to do is to make peace.

598
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:50,100
I'm inviting you, I'm Moms Basement, my podcast, to attempt to talk this out and to make peace,

599
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:56,100
if you don't want to come on my show, I'll go on your show, but we need to make peace.

600
00:46:56,100 --> 00:47:04,100
This is affecting our companies, our careers, and not really my mental health,

601
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:11,100
but you said that it affected your mental health, so it's time to make peace.

602
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:14,100
Hypothetically, you can understand why Keemstar wanted to do this,

603
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:18,100
but logically it was something that H3 was very unlikely to agree to.

604
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:21,100
Maybe Keem knew that, and he wanted to appear to be the reasonable party,

605
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:25,100
but Ethan wasn't one to negotiate with someone he wanted to truly present as a terrible person,

606
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:29,100
given the lengths that he had gone to emphasise how bad a person Keemstar was,

607
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:34,100
and still was at that point, he had more to lose by patching up the drama with our bearded buddy.

608
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:37,100
However, what happened next seemed to cement his position.

609
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:43,100
Ethan- I've been wanting to make a podcast with another comedian for a while, and I don't mean that to compliment you.

610
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:49,100
I think I mean two big personalities, and in my mind when I kept trying to think of people to do it with,

611
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:56,100
I always thought, you know, me and Trisha have a really funny chemistry on all of your visits,

612
00:47:56,100 --> 00:48:03,100
and I thought, well, you know, fuck it, let's just do it like that, let's do it live, fuck it!

613
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:05,100
Trisha- Oh, but this isn't live though.

614
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:06,100
Ethan- No, it's just still.

615
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:12,100
On September the 15th, Trisha made their return to the H3 podcast, however this wasn't just any old appearance,

616
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:15,100
and the way this was presented and discussed, this was the start of a new era,

617
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:21,100
a series featuring both Ethan and Trisha, where they discuss various dramatic and miscellaneous content,

618
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:25,100
whatever took their interest, based on that core appeal that had worked so naturally before.

619
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:29,100
Although many hypothesise this had been brought on by their mutual dislike of Keem,

620
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:32,100
they refrain from mentioning him until the end of the show.

621
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:36,100
Ethan- We can talk about Keemstar, whatever you want.

622
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:40,100
Trisha- Love you, much drama alert? Should we shout it out, promo?

623
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:41,100
Ethan- Drama alert?

624
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:42,100
Trisha- Yeah, what up?

625
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:44,100
Ethan- You wanna give a shout out to drama alert?

626
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:47,100
Trisha- Nothing but love, we're all peace and positive here.

627
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:48,100
Ethan- Yeah, Keemstar's the best.

628
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:53,100
It was welcomed with opened arms by their audience, but with circumstances and characters in mind,

629
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:56,100
I'm sure many wondered if it was going to survive beyond a couple episodes.

630
00:48:56,100 --> 00:49:00,100
Ethan and Trisha's working relationship often seemed borne out of a mutual cause,

631
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:03,100
and it's not that a cause like that can't be worthwhile,

632
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:06,100
but the question is what happens when that cause is ultimately fulfilled,

633
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:08,100
like it was with The Bachelorette?

634
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:11,100
If this podcast was the result of other factors like Keemstar,

635
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:14,100
what happens when the influence of those factors inevitably lessens?

636
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:17,100
There had to be something deeper between Trisha and Ethan,

637
00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:19,100
but could they ever find it?

638
00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:23,100
Well, let's talk about the centrepiece of Ethan and Trisha's tumultuous relationship.

639
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:35,100
In a way, Frenemies was a concept that was constructed of Trisha and Ethan's established rapport.

640
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:38,100
The fact that on one hand they'd had friendly conversations,

641
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:40,100
they'd had productive discourse on certain matters,

642
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:44,100
but they'd also had their fair share of drama and fallings out after they had seemingly record-styled.

643
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:47,100
The question on many people's minds was how do you keep a podcast going

644
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:50,100
with two people who may hate each other on a certain day,

645
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:52,100
who may not talk for months?

646
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:55,100
Well, money maybe, but even then, if you're not really committed to something,

647
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:57,100
it tends to shift.

648
00:49:57,100 --> 00:50:01,100
Even then, if you're not really committed to something, it tends to show.

649
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:26,100
However, in the first episode, there clearly was a commitment involved.

650
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:30,100
They even had their impersonalised set to contrast between the two creators,

651
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:34,100
Ethan on that brooding dark side, and Trisha with their pink-spirited jollity.

652
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:37,100
I mean, to be honest, that's not an accurate representation of their style,

653
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:41,100
but I suppose that is the sort of energy they tend to emanate at least.

654
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:46,100
In that introduction, Ethan emphasised that these two were drawn together for that unique chemistry,

655
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:49,100
seemingly debunking the idea that this was a tactical decision on his part.

656
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:52,100
There was acknowledgement that this could go pear-shaped very quickly,

657
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:55,100
but both seemed to have an understanding of the potential outcomes,

658
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:58,100
intrepidly embracing them, and from the first minute of the first episode,

659
00:50:58,100 --> 00:51:02,100
that quirky chemistry that everyone seemed to identify was on exhibit.

660
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:26,100
In a way, though, this time it was intended.

661
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:29,100
It's not like Trisha didn't mean what they had said in the past.

662
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:34,100
It meant that this environment was actively fostered in acknowledgement of its subsequent public release.

663
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:39,100
A friend of his episodes is basically a compilation of the conversations you have with your friend.

664
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:42,100
In all honesty, you'd be afraid to ever provide a public platform.

665
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:47,100
But Trisha was that friend who already had the platform, so in a way, people almost felt more permitting,

666
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:49,100
because it wasn't like they had much to gain from it.

667
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:55,100
In return, Ethan Handel gallantly found an aspect for his podcast that he had been desperately missing in the past.

668
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:57,100
That raw chemistry.

669
00:51:57,100 --> 00:52:25,100
He'd finally shown his critics that he could actually do something that many doubted he could.

670
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:31,100
I think the problem with his previous intues was that Ethan and Hila aren't the best at starting conversation,

671
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:35,100
and when dealing with more stoic guests, this tended to lead to some awkward interactions.

672
00:52:35,100 --> 00:52:38,100
Trisha was probably the most world-curious guest they had,

673
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:42,100
and Trisha always provided Ethan with at least ten zany comments to find one response to,

674
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:44,100
which Ethan could always do.

675
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:49,100
The highs yielded quality banter, excellent repartee, and chemistry for the ages.

676
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:52,100
However, with the sunshine came the rain.

677
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:05,100
Surprisingly, the first four episodes went without major incident.

678
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:11,100
However, the fifth build as a Halloween special is where the greasy wheels appear to detach from the ramshackle machine.

679
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:15,100
Trisha has a habit of going nuclear rather quickly, and I'll discuss why in a moment,

680
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:22,100
but whenever they feel slightly attacked, they seem to fight back with a thousand times the ferocity of that which was initially launched on them.

681
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:29,100
In this case, during a discussion on transparency, Trisha brings up the subject of Ethan's substance abuse to prove that he's not as open as he claims.

682
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:34,100
Ethan, feeling blindsided by this comment, accuses Trisha of weaponizing his problems against him.

683
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:37,100
This strikes a nerve with Trisha, and it quickly goes downhill from there.

684
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:48,100
I've never said anything like that to him.

685
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:50,100
I've seen your group chats. I literally see his phone.

686
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:54,100
Well, you bragging about looking through his phone isn't exactly the best look.

687
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:56,100
I'm not bragging about it. I'm stating something because, once again, I'm open.

688
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:59,100
Well, I've never said anything like that. I'm trying to resolve this because-

689
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:02,100
The more we talk about it, the worse it's going to be. Like, good luck. Honestly, good luck.

690
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:06,100
Thanks for having me on five episodes. Love it. It was so much fun, and I'm over it.

691
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:10,100
Good luck, and I'm sorry about your family situation. I'm sorry about your situation.

692
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:11,100
I know you're miserable.

693
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:12,100
No, it's not true.

694
00:54:12,100 --> 00:54:14,100
You are. I can tell. I can tell, and it's sadness.

695
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:16,100
And I see you when I was around your family that you have sadness in you, and it's sad.

696
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:17,100
Okay.

697
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:19,100
And that's why you're so mean to people on the internet, and I get it,

698
00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:22,100
but also don't take it out on people and call them crazy and shit.

699
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:27,100
Well, we're going out on a high note here, folks, all for your viewing pleasure.

700
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:30,100
Just wire me for this later, and we'll talk never.

701
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:35,100
Because I just- I hate people just like- that are you. You're the person I hate in this world.

702
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:36,100
Really?

703
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:38,100
That's so just offensive, but they do nothing wrong.

704
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:41,100
And when people are provoked, oh, they're crazy, calling girls crazy and stuff like that.

705
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:45,100
It's like- but taking no accountability, no responsibility.

706
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:47,100
You think everything's just an attack against you, everyone's against Ethan.

707
00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:49,100
Like, oh my gosh, I'm always right.

708
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:52,100
It's like, ugh, you and Jax won't serve each other, so.

709
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:55,100
Jax? I can't believe you're going after Jax. He's such a sweet guy.

710
00:54:55,100 --> 00:54:57,100
Bye, love you.

711
00:54:57,100 --> 00:54:58,100
All right, Trisha.

712
00:54:58,100 --> 00:55:00,100
All right, bye. Thanks for the great episode.

713
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:04,100
It's quite a sight to behold Ethan perched there in his Uncle Fester costume.

714
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:08,100
But visuals aside, this did spawn a situation that clearly troubled those involved.

715
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:10,100
For some, this would be drama, this would be funny.

716
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:15,100
But for the podcast, this was the surfacing of a problem that has been present with Trisha for years,

717
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:18,100
and it definitely brought into question whether this dynamic was healthy.

718
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:23,100
I'm gonna try to do a post-mortem on this.

719
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:27,100
I don't know, maybe she's just having a bad day.

720
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:31,100
I haven't spoken about it too much yet, and I don't want to speak about it too much in general,

721
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:35,100
but Trisha has been quite open about their struggles with Borderline Personality Disorder,

722
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:42,100
a condition that alongside other symptoms can cause intense emotional instability and impulsivity in individuals affected by it.

723
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:45,100
This has obviously been demonstrated in certain scenes of the podcast,

724
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:50,100
and when you see Trisha storm off, some would draw that what you're actually witnessing is an episode of BPD,

725
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:54,100
and question whether it's actually ethical that we're even witnessing what's going on.

726
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:59,100
Everyone accepted that this time around these sorts of interactions were a very real possibility,

727
00:55:59,100 --> 00:56:03,100
and in an attempt to preserve that raw nature to make sure that we're receiving the full picture,

728
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:05,100
even the ugliest parts are left in.

729
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:09,100
Yet, although that rawness was in itself an appeal for many viewers,

730
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:14,100
it also led some to question whether this was really fair given Trisha's own personality disorders,

731
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:18,100
given that these outbursts were thought to be a symptom of the condition in question.

732
00:56:18,100 --> 00:56:23,100
It's a commonplace discussion because on one hand, you never want to rob an individual of their agency,

733
00:56:23,100 --> 00:56:28,100
and let me make it crystal clear, Trisha consented to be on the podcast from its inception to its cessation,

734
00:56:28,100 --> 00:56:31,100
however at the same time when you're walking around topics that could trigger someone,

735
00:56:31,100 --> 00:56:35,100
when you're on a podcast that actively acknowledges that it could become nasty pretty quickly,

736
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:39,100
you also have to make sure you're not just carelessly exploiting that.

737
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:43,100
Although I think anyone would be pressed to say that Ethan ever went out of his way to torment Trisha,

738
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:49,100
also doing nothing about that sort of dysfunctional environment could be seen as passively allowing that toxicity to thrive,

739
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:54,100
which although spectacular points, doesn't really do much good for you, Trisha, or anyone else who works on the podcast,

740
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:59,100
and the moment you stop taking those outbursts seriously, then you risk enabling that behaviour as well.

741
00:56:59,100 --> 00:57:05,100
This was an emergent problem that was going to cause a very imminent demise if something wasn't done about it.

742
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:14,100
If these were normal podcast episodes, then these disruptions would have likely been the end of Trisha and Ethan's friendship

743
00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:18,100
for at least another few months, and at first it did seem like Trisha was not going to be returning to the podcast,

744
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:22,100
however given that they had this partnership going, this was something that worked to an extent,

745
00:57:22,100 --> 00:57:26,100
I think it gave both parties a greater impetus to try and maintain it.

746
00:57:26,100 --> 00:57:29,100
At the same time, doing nothing wasn't the best option either, and in the episode following,

747
00:57:29,100 --> 00:57:35,100
the tension between the two was still palpable, with Trisha reluctant to open up to Ethan again after their heated exchange.

748
00:57:43,100 --> 00:57:49,100
Although there was progress throughout the episode, it felt like something more needed to be done to keep this alliance healthy and productive,

749
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:52,100
and by the next show it seemed like Ethan had found the solution.

750
00:57:58,100 --> 00:58:03,100
Allow me to introduce you to this man then, his name is Drew Pinsky, but is more informally known as Dr Drew.

751
00:58:03,100 --> 00:58:09,100
He has a renowned media personality and internist, which basically means that you specialise in treating a variety of elements

752
00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:14,100
of the body without the need for surgery. Some people use the term physician interchangeably with it,

753
00:58:14,100 --> 00:58:16,100
in case you're more familiar with that term.

754
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:21,100
Dr Drew is recognised for a plethora of programs, most notably Loveline, a phone-in show where he would provide

755
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:25,100
relationship, medical, and miscellaneous advice to listeners and callers alike.

756
00:58:25,100 --> 00:58:31,100
At its peak, it was incredibly popular, and Dr Drew was generally perceived as offering pretty decent guidance to those who requested it.

757
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:36,100
Since his discontinuation in 2016, he's continued to make appearances on a variety of broadcasts,

758
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:42,100
and has established himself online and on YouTube. On the surface, it seemed like he was a man with fairly solid credentials,

759
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:48,100
so with all this in mind, he was the sort of person who may be able to resolve, or at least ease the conflicts between Trish and Ethan.

760
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:54,100
So, on the 27th October, he was brought on for enemies to help address that rift that had grown between the two hosts.

761
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:56,100
Would he be up to the test?

762
00:59:03,100 --> 00:59:08,100
On one hand, the discussion appeared to go pretty well. Drew showed an interest in Trisha that allowed them to open up,

763
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:12,100
and they appeared to make progress on perhaps patching up old wounds. There's discourse on drug abuse,

764
00:59:12,100 --> 00:59:18,100
and as an expert on that front, Dr Drew really comes into his element. In many ways, I can see that this was useful for the two.

765
00:59:18,100 --> 00:59:23,100
On the other hand, there is a glaring issue. Dr Drew is not a therapist, and although he's knowledgeable,

766
00:59:23,100 --> 00:59:27,100
he lacks the tact that is typically aspired for by those in that profession.

767
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:34,100
I feel like we have amazing chemistry, and I see the goodness in you, and I know that you're always fighting to bring that out,

768
00:59:34,100 --> 00:59:40,100
more than when you get upset, or you do this and that, and the stuff you regret. I don't ever see that as who you are,

769
00:59:40,100 --> 00:59:43,100
I know who you are, and I love that person as a friend of mine.

770
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:45,100
Okay, well thank you.

771
00:59:45,100 --> 00:59:50,100
I said it was Ethan's idea to bring Dr Drew on because he seems to take credit for bringing him on at the start of the video.

772
00:59:50,100 --> 00:59:55,100
However, if this hadn't been explained, you would be forgiven for thinking that this individual was drafted in by Trisha.

773
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:58,100
I don't want to do that, I don't want to hurt anyone, even in my relationship now.

774
00:59:58,100 --> 01:00:02,100
I am trying to sabotage it to not make it last, because I don't want to be harmful to anybody,

775
01:00:02,100 --> 01:00:05,100
and I am, I'm dangerous to myself, I'm dangerous to other people, and it's bad.

776
01:00:05,100 --> 01:00:10,100
Okay, so Ethan, can you see how when you say something like this is a weaponized, you're attacking me,

777
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:14,100
that's tough territory for her right now. You got it?

778
01:00:14,100 --> 01:00:15,100
Yeah, no.

779
01:00:15,100 --> 01:00:16,100
You understand? Okay.

780
01:00:16,100 --> 01:00:17,100
Yeah, for sure.

781
01:00:17,100 --> 01:00:18,100
So here's the deal.

782
01:00:18,100 --> 01:00:22,100
Now I don't want to necessarily place all the responsibility onto Plinsky immediately,

783
01:00:22,100 --> 01:00:29,100
because I accept that there was the possibility that Ethan briefed the Doctor in a specific way that would make him more drawn to sympathy on Trisha's end.

784
01:00:29,100 --> 01:00:34,100
However, even some of the comments that he makes seem to be slanted or strangely passive aggressive.

785
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:36,100
Oh damn, Tana's looking pretty good.

786
01:00:36,100 --> 01:00:37,100
Okay, stop it, stop it.

787
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:38,100
Okay.

788
01:00:38,100 --> 01:00:39,100
Oh my goodness.

789
01:00:39,100 --> 01:00:44,100
So, so, Immerse, so, I didn't know her at all, I didn't even know her name, and then I did that.

790
01:00:44,100 --> 01:00:47,100
You're one of those people on the internet, my man.

791
01:00:47,100 --> 01:00:48,100
Wait, me?

792
01:00:48,100 --> 01:00:49,100
No, no, he is.

793
01:00:49,100 --> 01:00:50,100
Oh, thank you.

794
01:00:51,100 --> 01:00:53,100
Feeling free to attack people he doesn't know.

795
01:00:53,100 --> 01:00:54,100
Exactly.

796
01:00:54,100 --> 01:00:56,100
Wait, what do you mean one of those people?

797
01:00:57,100 --> 01:01:05,100
One of those people that I'm swatting off every day, that doesn't understand that people that are out there on the internet are actually people.

798
01:01:05,100 --> 01:01:11,100
I will preface by saying that I'm not a therapist, but I have experienced therapy, and I'd like to think I know a thing or two about working with people,

799
01:01:11,100 --> 01:01:16,100
and one of the things that you should be doing as a therapist is helping someone open up.

800
01:01:16,100 --> 01:01:21,100
Immediately antagonising someone publicly, even in semi-jest, is not going to do that.

801
01:01:21,100 --> 01:01:28,100
It's not the only snarky remark he makes, and it really feels out of place for what he's been asked to do, however my issues don't end there.

802
01:01:28,100 --> 01:01:34,100
One of the endless problems with Dr Drew are these closed statements that fail to explore a person's feelings.

803
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:40,100
I really don't want to go too much on a tangent here, but it's really important that a patient can find closure in their own judgement,

804
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:42,100
even if you've directed them there in a way.

805
01:01:42,100 --> 01:01:48,100
The problem is, when you end the discussion of a particular topic prematurely, even if you think you've wrapped it up,

806
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:53,100
the discomfort in that person will linger, whether it's discomfort with your judgement, or doubt of their own judgement.

807
01:01:53,100 --> 01:01:57,100
It's not a healthy place to leave someone, particularly if you directly conflicted with their own opinion.

808
01:01:57,100 --> 01:02:00,100
Drew, you could tell me if I need to apologise or not on this one.

809
01:02:00,100 --> 01:02:01,100
She looks like a Twinkie!

810
01:02:01,100 --> 01:02:03,100
Alright, this is what Bonnicon was promoted as.

811
01:02:03,100 --> 01:02:05,100
Apology warranted?

812
01:02:05,100 --> 01:02:06,100
Um...

813
01:02:06,100 --> 01:02:08,100
The yellow outfit was the...

814
01:02:08,100 --> 01:02:13,100
In a weird way, that's making too much of nothing, which is, guess what, photographs lie.

815
01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:18,100
And if we don't know that by now, then caveat emptor, you know what I mean?

816
01:02:18,100 --> 01:02:22,100
And I think, I don't know that woman, I mean if you feel like you hurt her feelings, you should apologise.

817
01:02:22,100 --> 01:02:24,100
You don't want to hurt her, I'd assume.

818
01:02:24,100 --> 01:02:26,100
I don't think I've hurt her feelings, I think you just...

819
01:02:26,100 --> 01:02:28,100
Yeah, I don't think she cares.

820
01:02:28,100 --> 01:02:35,100
Right, so I don't think it's a big deal, but there is something to be learned from that, which is that photos lie, videos lie too.

821
01:02:35,100 --> 01:02:42,100
Dr Drew kinda establishes himself as an authority in providing opinions on topics throughout the episode, and that's not really right.

822
01:02:42,100 --> 01:02:47,100
Ethan doesn't handle this the best admittedly by thrusting the emphasis on whether he should apologise to Pinsky,

823
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:50,100
but at that point you as a therapist need to step in and say,

824
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:57,100
hey, it's not my job to arbitrate these specific situations, it's my job to help you arbitrate them yourselves.

825
01:02:57,100 --> 01:03:01,100
Nobody needs to know Dr Drew's opinion on this subject to find resolution.

826
01:03:01,100 --> 01:03:04,100
This isn't to say that he can't express feelings about certain matters,

827
01:03:04,100 --> 01:03:07,100
and in many places he speaks with power to subjects that are helpful,

828
01:03:07,100 --> 01:03:11,100
but he often seems too driven to make a judgement before all the facts are on the table.

829
01:03:11,100 --> 01:03:12,100
Case in points?

830
01:03:12,100 --> 01:03:16,100
Okay, there was an issue, this is a whole different issue, but I had an issue with my boyfriend, which is his brother-in-law,

831
01:03:16,100 --> 01:03:20,100
with private DMs, he exposed all these private things, so there's no boundaries when it comes to me.

832
01:03:20,100 --> 01:03:21,100
No, I get it.

833
01:03:21,100 --> 01:03:25,100
But as soon as I bring up something private with him, then what triggered me was his like,

834
01:03:25,100 --> 01:03:27,100
whoa, you're weaponising, oh my god, you're being abused and crazy now.

835
01:03:27,100 --> 01:03:29,100
Yeah, I never weaponised anything against him.

836
01:03:29,100 --> 01:03:32,100
No, no, no, you told me I was weaponising when all of a sudden I thought that was our relationship,

837
01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:35,100
just saying whatever, just everything's out in the open, so I was like, okay.

838
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:36,100
That's what I thought, so she's confused.

839
01:03:36,100 --> 01:03:40,100
It confuses her to not know where you're supposed to draw the line, right?

840
01:03:40,100 --> 01:03:41,100
Yeah, I was shocked.

841
01:03:41,100 --> 01:03:47,100
Okay, but don't you see why me now would never say anything like that to you in private?

842
01:03:47,100 --> 01:03:51,100
I can see that, but the same thing, you read private text messages I sent only to you.

843
01:03:51,100 --> 01:03:59,100
Hold on, hold on, Ethan, Ethan, not saying things in private to her because of that does not make you an open person, right?

844
01:03:59,100 --> 01:04:04,100
You can't say, I'm totally open about everything, but I can't trust you, so I'm not going to be open.

845
01:04:04,100 --> 01:04:09,100
It's okay, you don't have to tell everybody everything, but don't claim that you're wide open and telling everybody everything.

846
01:04:09,100 --> 01:04:12,100
She's the one that's really wide open, too much, too much so, right?

847
01:04:12,100 --> 01:04:14,100
I agree, I do agree with that.

848
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:18,100
Ethan has expressed a direct disagreement with what Trisha's recalling.

849
01:04:18,100 --> 01:04:24,100
At that point, you have to unravel that, otherwise you can't be certain that the image that is being projected is an accurate one.

850
01:04:24,100 --> 01:04:28,100
Instead, Dr Drew takes Trisha's word as gospel and moves in with his thoughts,

851
01:04:28,100 --> 01:04:32,100
but without addressing the fact that this judgement may be based on presuppositions that aren't exactly true,

852
01:04:32,100 --> 01:04:36,100
there's no guaranteed validity, and once again, no guaranteed closure.

853
01:04:36,100 --> 01:04:43,100
If there's a sensitive personal subject that had previously been publicly revealed, that's very different to one being exposed for the first time.

854
01:04:43,100 --> 01:04:47,100
In a way, Dr Drew is somewhat disadvantaged in judging these situations.

855
01:04:47,100 --> 01:04:53,100
He is unfamiliar with the podcast, he clearly hadn't watched the situation transpire as he is approaching it with fresh eyes.

856
01:04:53,100 --> 01:04:58,100
However, when you do that, you also need to know that someone's word may not be completely accurate,

857
01:04:58,100 --> 01:05:02,100
and if you assume it to be right, you risk never bridging that divide.

858
01:05:06,100 --> 01:05:12,100
Oh, and I've gotten help for the past year because I had two mental hospital stays where I was put on a 5150.

859
01:05:12,100 --> 01:05:15,100
So like, I go into these, like...

860
01:05:15,100 --> 01:05:16,100
These states.

861
01:05:16,100 --> 01:05:20,100
Yeah, like, it's like a blackout where I'm like, not that person.

862
01:05:20,100 --> 01:05:21,100
Yes.

863
01:05:21,100 --> 01:05:24,100
And like, that was the first time that happened, so now that that's out there on the internet,

864
01:05:24,100 --> 01:05:29,100
like everyone thinks that's just me, that I just like, abuse people, and it's like, it's never been that far.

865
01:05:29,100 --> 01:05:33,100
It's difficult when dealing with Trisha because you don't want to risk triggering an episode,

866
01:05:33,100 --> 01:05:38,100
but at the same time, you also want to be careful when dealing with someone whose narratives can be somewhat unreliable.

867
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:43,100
You could be providing life-changing advice, but it wouldn't matter if it's under false pretenses.

868
01:05:43,100 --> 01:05:49,100
The presentation of this is couples counselling, but by the end it has really transformed into Trisha's counselling,

869
01:05:49,100 --> 01:05:53,100
with the occasional input from Klein, and maybe it makes sense given that Trisha has more issues,

870
01:05:53,100 --> 01:05:58,100
but when you're trying to repair that bond, there has to be some semblance that you're keeping a couple on even footing.

871
01:05:58,100 --> 01:06:00,100
They have to be in this together.

872
01:06:01,100 --> 01:06:04,100
Yeah, I can see why your relationships don't work out.

873
01:06:04,100 --> 01:06:06,100
I can see why you've been with the same person for 12 years.

874
01:06:06,100 --> 01:06:07,100
Thank you.

875
01:06:07,100 --> 01:06:10,100
You have no other options, and quite frankly, I don't blame you.

876
01:06:10,100 --> 01:06:13,100
Ethan may have had problems in how he interacted with Trisha.

877
01:06:13,100 --> 01:06:16,100
He knew that friendlies needed conflict, but it's a fine line to walk,

878
01:06:16,100 --> 01:06:20,100
and it's fair to say that at points he may have crossed a few sensitive boundaries.

879
01:06:20,100 --> 01:06:23,100
However, it was a shared change that needed to be undertaken,

880
01:06:23,100 --> 01:06:26,100
and even with the understanding that Trisha was working on themself,

881
01:06:26,100 --> 01:06:30,100
they still had a commitment to the podcast as well if they wanted to maintain it.

882
01:06:30,100 --> 01:06:33,100
Nonetheless, towards the end we appear to be moving in that direction,

883
01:06:33,100 --> 01:06:36,100
as there seem to be heartfelt comments from both co-hosts,

884
01:06:36,100 --> 01:06:40,100
expressing remorse for previous hostility, and expressing desire to build from that.

885
01:06:40,100 --> 01:06:42,100
I do, I feel horrible.

886
01:06:42,100 --> 01:06:46,100
I do apologise for being so nasty, like from the pill thing,

887
01:06:46,100 --> 01:06:50,100
because I know how that feels, and I apologise for trying to be tough and badass,

888
01:06:50,100 --> 01:06:52,100
and talking about Ela and everything.

889
01:06:52,100 --> 01:06:54,100
I always feel bad, like I feel bad about it,

890
01:06:54,100 --> 01:06:57,100
when it's not in a joking mode, when it wasn't, when you triggered me, I felt bad.

891
01:06:57,100 --> 01:06:59,100
When I was like, good luck, trying to get your wife pregnant,

892
01:06:59,100 --> 01:07:01,100
it was just a mean thing, I don't know what it was, and I'm sorry,

893
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:03,100
and I feel bad, like that's not me.

894
01:07:03,100 --> 01:07:07,100
It's not the last time you'll do it.

895
01:07:07,100 --> 01:07:12,100
At the end, you may have been given the impression that this was actually a proper reconciliation,

896
01:07:12,100 --> 01:07:16,100
with Klein and Paytas thanking Dr Drew, committing to another episode with him in the future,

897
01:07:16,100 --> 01:07:19,100
and the podcast ending on a considerably triumphant note,

898
01:07:19,100 --> 01:07:21,100
but it all felt a bit hollow to me.

899
01:07:21,100 --> 01:07:23,100
Maybe that's with the context of where we are right now,

900
01:07:23,100 --> 01:07:26,100
but even then it's very difficult to take anything at face value,

901
01:07:26,100 --> 01:07:31,100
because even becoming invested in this progression requires an assurance that we wouldn't end back in this place

902
01:07:31,100 --> 01:07:33,100
that caused this episode to occur,

903
01:07:33,100 --> 01:07:36,100
and I wouldn't think that everyone was prepared to invest themselves in that,

904
01:07:36,100 --> 01:07:38,100
especially given the difficulty of acquiring the truth,

905
01:07:38,100 --> 01:07:41,100
and how Trisha even presented that in the podcast.

906
01:07:41,100 --> 01:07:43,100
It felt like we could end up here again,

907
01:07:43,100 --> 01:07:45,100
and lo and behold, we did.

908
01:07:45,100 --> 01:07:47,100
Yeah, Hila was watching and she said,

909
01:07:47,100 --> 01:07:50,100
why didn't you tell her that she had powder on her lips?

910
01:07:50,100 --> 01:07:54,100
I was like, I mean, I was staring at it the whole time.

911
01:07:54,100 --> 01:07:56,100
You're so mean.

912
01:07:56,100 --> 01:07:59,100
On my screen it just looked like a glint on your lip gloss.

913
01:07:59,100 --> 01:08:01,100
In the beginning I said you have powder on your lips,

914
01:08:01,100 --> 01:08:04,100
but then you didn't get it all off, and the whole episode I was just staring at.

915
01:08:04,100 --> 01:08:06,100
Can we have Hila as a guest on our podcast?

916
01:08:06,100 --> 01:08:08,100
No. She's busy. Don't talk about Hila.

917
01:08:08,100 --> 01:08:11,100
We're cutting this part out. She doesn't want to be talked about.

918
01:08:11,100 --> 01:08:13,100
Are you fucking serious?

919
01:08:13,100 --> 01:08:15,100
We have to cut this.

920
01:08:15,100 --> 01:08:17,100
That's fucking crazy.

921
01:08:17,100 --> 01:08:19,100
Like, what's even the point in the one we talked about?

922
01:08:19,100 --> 01:08:21,100
Because she doesn't like that you're always bringing her up

923
01:08:21,100 --> 01:08:23,100
and saying how she doesn't like you and all this shit

924
01:08:23,100 --> 01:08:25,100
because it's not true and she finds it annoying

925
01:08:25,100 --> 01:08:29,100
because she doesn't want people to start thinking that she doesn't actually like you.

926
01:08:29,100 --> 01:08:31,100
Well, she doesn't. Whatever. It's so fake,

927
01:08:31,100 --> 01:08:33,100
and that's why H3 is not what it was,

928
01:08:33,100 --> 01:08:35,100
because you guys are fake as fuck and cut things out.

929
01:08:35,100 --> 01:08:37,100
Okay, you're like on a thing now.

930
01:08:37,100 --> 01:08:39,100
I'm not. I just think it's so fake. It's so bullshit.

931
01:08:39,100 --> 01:08:41,100
It's like, oh, let's talk about everything.

932
01:08:41,100 --> 01:08:43,100
Ask not to be included.

933
01:08:43,100 --> 01:08:45,100
And I'm respecting her request.

934
01:08:45,100 --> 01:08:47,100
Ben, I'm not talking about anything personal anymore.

935
01:08:47,100 --> 01:08:49,100
I won't talk about Moses. I won't talk about me.

936
01:08:49,100 --> 01:08:51,100
Like, it's just, whatever. Who cares?

937
01:08:51,100 --> 01:08:53,100
Should we...

938
01:08:53,100 --> 01:08:55,100
Cut it. I didn't cut all of it. I literally couldn't kill us.

939
01:08:55,100 --> 01:08:57,100
It was approaching Christmas when another frack has occurred,

940
01:08:57,100 --> 01:09:01,100
this time over the topic of Hila not wishing to be spoken about on the podcast.

941
01:09:01,100 --> 01:09:05,100
Both involved seem to try and fail to de-escalate the situation at different points,

942
01:09:05,100 --> 01:09:07,100
causing discussion to rapidly intensify,

943
01:09:07,100 --> 01:09:09,100
culminating in Trisha storming out

944
01:09:09,100 --> 01:09:11,100
and making some exceptionally strong comments.

945
01:09:39,100 --> 01:10:03,100
Over the next few days, Trisha put out videos elucidating on their feelings.

946
01:10:03,100 --> 01:10:05,100
These videos were long-winded and not the clearest.

947
01:10:05,100 --> 01:10:07,100
Some of them are very angry, some of them are sad,

948
01:10:07,100 --> 01:10:09,100
but they all highlighted one thing,

949
01:10:09,100 --> 01:10:11,100
that Trisha was struggling with their identity,

950
01:10:11,100 --> 01:10:13,100
and often didn't know what portrait they wanted portrayed on the podcast,

951
01:10:13,100 --> 01:10:17,100
yet they didn't feel like they had a choice in many capacities.

952
01:10:17,100 --> 01:10:23,100
I don't like pushing myself for the sake of drama for the show.

953
01:10:23,100 --> 01:10:25,100
I don't mind it to be.

954
01:10:25,100 --> 01:10:29,100
I don't mind, obviously, I love Ethan and find Ethan funny.

955
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:31,100
I like our dynamic.

956
01:10:31,100 --> 01:10:35,100
You know, it's very similar to when I was friends with David Dobrik.

957
01:10:35,100 --> 01:10:39,100
I liked the poking.

958
01:10:39,100 --> 01:10:41,100
I think it's fun.

959
01:10:41,100 --> 01:10:43,100
I think it's entertaining, obviously.

960
01:10:43,100 --> 01:10:45,100
People find it entertaining.

961
01:10:45,100 --> 01:10:47,100
And I like it.

962
01:10:47,100 --> 01:10:51,100
I find it somewhat stimulating to have an opponent, if you will.

963
01:10:51,100 --> 01:10:57,100
But I do think Ethan pushes me to get this reaction of me walking out.

964
01:10:57,100 --> 01:10:59,100
Me walking out is something I don't like.

965
01:10:59,100 --> 01:11:01,100
This seemingly caused a lot of anguish within them,

966
01:11:01,100 --> 01:11:03,100
and in many ways it looked like the only solution was to quit,

967
01:11:03,100 --> 01:11:05,100
with Trisha even acknowledging it as a viable option.

968
01:11:05,100 --> 01:11:07,100
However, after the success of Dr Drew's first appearance,

969
01:11:07,100 --> 01:11:11,100
our expert was once more called in to settle their feud,

970
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:13,100
this time alongside Dr Mark Young,

971
01:11:13,100 --> 01:11:15,100
an expert on entertainment and business.

972
01:11:15,100 --> 01:11:19,100
Well, Dr Drew was already pre-booked for this appearance,

973
01:11:19,100 --> 01:11:21,100
it just coincided with the pair falling out,

974
01:11:21,100 --> 01:11:23,100
so I guess it all fell into place.

975
01:11:23,100 --> 01:11:27,100
However, this episode was definitely more contentious than the last.

976
01:11:27,100 --> 01:11:29,100
There are obviously tonal issues that I've previously discussed,

977
01:11:29,100 --> 01:11:33,100
but many of people's problems come down to the core message of the episode.

978
01:11:33,100 --> 01:11:35,100
It's two hours, and I'm not going to be talking about all of it.

979
01:11:35,100 --> 01:11:37,100
Watch it yourself if you dare.

980
01:11:59,100 --> 01:12:05,100
Arriving a wedge between Moses and his family.

981
01:12:05,100 --> 01:12:07,100
There's one more piece that I think is important.

982
01:12:07,100 --> 01:12:11,100
When I ask Moses, when Hila asks Moses about it,

983
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:15,100
Moses says, I didn't say that.

984
01:12:15,100 --> 01:12:17,100
Yeah, that's actually not important.

985
01:12:17,100 --> 01:12:21,100
The main question posed is how these two should be dealing with Trisha's outburst.

986
01:12:21,100 --> 01:12:25,100
Now on Trisha's front this is a difficult question for sure,

987
01:12:25,100 --> 01:12:28,100
but this is why you need someone who's actually an expert in this field.

988
01:12:28,100 --> 01:12:32,100
Dr. Drew for all his abilities and qualifications is not,

989
01:12:32,100 --> 01:12:34,100
so the focus often turns to Ethan,

990
01:12:34,100 --> 01:12:37,100
where the discourse quickly becomes focused around how he should deal with Trisha,

991
01:12:37,100 --> 01:12:40,100
but Dr. Drew's advice on this front also falls short.

992
01:12:40,100 --> 01:12:41,100
You just will.

993
01:12:41,100 --> 01:12:44,100
And Ethan, your job is to not respond to splitting.

994
01:12:44,100 --> 01:12:50,100
Yeah, but she's driving, but I can't, if she's my wife.

995
01:12:50,100 --> 01:12:53,100
I gotta get on your case for this one.

996
01:12:53,100 --> 01:12:56,100
You are allowing the wedge to be put in the place.

997
01:12:56,100 --> 01:12:58,100
She is doing what she does.

998
01:12:58,100 --> 01:13:02,100
She is doing her splitting thing, and your job is to go, uh-huh.

999
01:13:02,100 --> 01:13:08,100
You know also, Trisha, that one of your things is unregulated aggression, hostility.

1000
01:13:08,100 --> 01:13:10,100
Once it gets going, it goes, right?

1001
01:13:10,100 --> 01:13:11,100
Yeah.

1002
01:13:11,100 --> 01:13:14,100
And then Ethan somehow can't handle that when that happens.

1003
01:13:14,100 --> 01:13:15,100
I can handle it.

1004
01:13:15,100 --> 01:13:19,100
Well, no, you escalate it, as opposed to just containing it.

1005
01:13:19,100 --> 01:13:21,100
You gotta watch the clip.

1006
01:13:21,100 --> 01:13:25,100
The whole mantra of merely moving on from inflammatory behaviour seems rather disagreeable.

1007
01:13:25,100 --> 01:13:30,100
Maybe if they were both 10, it would be some wise old parenting adage, but they're not.

1008
01:13:30,100 --> 01:13:33,100
You are allowed to assert boundaries at this stage of a supposed friendship.

1009
01:13:33,100 --> 01:13:38,100
It's almost like Drew believes that any other action other than rolling over is innately provocative,

1010
01:13:38,100 --> 01:13:40,100
and that's just not true.

1011
01:13:40,100 --> 01:13:44,100
As a matter of fact, you could well be enabling toxic behaviour by not at least challenging it.

1012
01:13:44,100 --> 01:13:48,100
Personality disorders may make you more predisposed to certain behaviours,

1013
01:13:48,100 --> 01:13:51,100
and it may help understand and explain actions,

1014
01:13:51,100 --> 01:13:54,100
which is why it's important to approach these situations with sympathy,

1015
01:13:54,100 --> 01:13:56,100
but it is never an entire explanation,

1016
01:13:56,100 --> 01:14:01,100
because the moment it becomes that you're not only painting all those people with personality disorders in a bad light,

1017
01:14:01,100 --> 01:14:04,100
but you are giving a person a blank check to let it happen again.

1018
01:14:04,100 --> 01:14:08,100
So you shouldn't take offence when you don't know what's what.

1019
01:14:08,100 --> 01:14:12,100
You just can't take offence to stuff when people are just talking.

1020
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:19,100
Later, if you're able to substantiate these things and find out that Moses is not trustworthy,

1021
01:14:19,100 --> 01:14:23,100
or does feel the way that Trisha's telling you, well then it's something to talk about.

1022
01:14:23,100 --> 01:14:26,100
But in the meantime, it's just whatever, don't react.

1023
01:14:26,100 --> 01:14:31,100
In a way, I think the problem comes down to the fact that Dr Drew has been brought on to save the podcast,

1024
01:14:31,100 --> 01:14:35,100
and maybe the only viable option in their mind is for Ethan to appease Trisha,

1025
01:14:35,100 --> 01:14:37,100
but it's not a healthy option long term,

1026
01:14:37,100 --> 01:14:41,100
and maybe in this scenario, the only way to save their actual substantive friendship

1027
01:14:41,100 --> 01:14:43,100
is to seek real therapy for each other,

1028
01:14:43,100 --> 01:14:47,100
and maybe not have every single interaction be a public spectacle.

1029
01:14:47,100 --> 01:14:51,100
I think, first of all, I'm willing to admit my mistake.

1030
01:14:51,100 --> 01:14:56,100
I should have definitely talked to you about this before we started recording.

1031
01:14:56,100 --> 01:14:57,100
I should have said, hey-

1032
01:14:57,100 --> 01:15:00,100
Can I stop you right there? That does not feel like you mean it.

1033
01:15:00,100 --> 01:15:03,100
Oh, it doesn't? I do mean it.

1034
01:15:03,100 --> 01:15:05,100
Make it really clear that you mean it,

1035
01:15:05,100 --> 01:15:09,100
because this will come back around to hurt you if she isn't convinced that you mean it.

1036
01:15:09,100 --> 01:15:13,100
One of the greatest issues of this generation of Hollywood experts and wannabe therapists

1037
01:15:13,100 --> 01:15:17,100
is that they are better at being media personalities than they are at dealing with real people

1038
01:15:17,100 --> 01:15:20,100
who wouldn't typically deal with their issues in the public spotlight.

1039
01:15:20,100 --> 01:15:23,100
I think it's completely acceptable to provide live advice in a format

1040
01:15:23,100 --> 01:15:25,100
that allows you to keep the person seeking advice anonymous,

1041
01:15:25,100 --> 01:15:28,100
or at least not make them the centre of the matter at hand.

1042
01:15:28,100 --> 01:15:31,100
However, when you're applying a very personal type of therapy,

1043
01:15:31,100 --> 01:15:34,100
you need more than charisma to make sure that what you're saying is actually helpful

1044
01:15:34,100 --> 01:15:37,100
for those who will inevitably take those words to heart.

1045
01:15:37,100 --> 01:15:38,100
Especially someone like Trisha.

1046
01:15:38,100 --> 01:15:41,100
What we were watching wasn't therapy, it was theatre,

1047
01:15:41,100 --> 01:15:44,100
and it was questioned whether the people involved were better off for it.

1048
01:15:44,100 --> 01:15:47,100
But I feel like with each of these blowups, you guys get,

1049
01:15:47,100 --> 01:15:52,100
I wouldn't say closer together, but it helps you guys manage your relationship better.

1050
01:15:52,100 --> 01:15:55,100
Also, this is the bullying builds character of 2020.

1051
01:15:55,100 --> 01:15:57,100
What a ridiculous statement.

1052
01:16:08,100 --> 01:16:10,100
Tell me what you think about the truth about what I mean by that.

1053
01:16:10,100 --> 01:16:11,100
You're asking me right now.

1054
01:16:11,100 --> 01:16:12,100
Because you're not being honest.

1055
01:16:12,100 --> 01:16:14,100
Okay, but do you want me to reply? I will be honest,

1056
01:16:14,100 --> 01:16:16,100
but I don't want you to be like, you're attacking my parenting.

1057
01:16:16,100 --> 01:16:17,100
Do you want my honest opinion?

1058
01:16:17,100 --> 01:16:19,100
No, because you said, well, okay.

1059
01:16:19,100 --> 01:16:21,100
You say, okay, well, your mom should be here then.

1060
01:16:21,100 --> 01:16:24,100
I do think I would have my mom watch over a nanny.

1061
01:16:24,100 --> 01:16:26,100
I don't trust strangers with my personal experience.

1062
01:16:26,100 --> 01:16:28,100
I don't think your nanny's the worst.

1063
01:16:28,100 --> 01:16:29,100
I'm just saying my personal experience.

1064
01:16:29,100 --> 01:16:33,100
This is not the exact conversation that happened,

1065
01:16:33,100 --> 01:16:35,100
and I don't think it's productive to go over it now.

1066
01:16:35,100 --> 01:16:36,100
Well, you just asked me.

1067
01:16:36,100 --> 01:16:38,100
Did you not just ask me to give you my opinion on this?

1068
01:16:38,100 --> 01:16:39,100
And that's what I'm saying.

1069
01:16:39,100 --> 01:16:40,100
Do you really want me to tell you?

1070
01:16:40,100 --> 01:16:41,100
I will.

1071
01:16:41,100 --> 01:16:42,100
I have no problem with it.

1072
01:16:42,100 --> 01:16:43,100
We already talked about this.

1073
01:16:43,100 --> 01:16:46,100
Okay, but you just asked me to give you an opinion again about it.

1074
01:16:46,100 --> 01:16:47,100
I heard your opinion.

1075
01:16:47,100 --> 01:16:48,100
I heard it.

1076
01:16:48,100 --> 01:16:49,100
I don't care to share it again.

1077
01:16:49,100 --> 01:16:51,100
I'm just saying like, if he wants me to reply, I will.

1078
01:16:51,100 --> 01:16:58,100
Because it's very obvious that she was in that moment digging as deep as possible.

1079
01:16:58,100 --> 01:16:59,100
I was not digging it.

1080
01:16:59,100 --> 01:17:00,100
He was pushing it.

1081
01:17:00,100 --> 01:17:01,100
Okay.

1082
01:17:01,100 --> 01:17:02,100
Okay.

1083
01:17:02,100 --> 01:17:05,100
Now, a lot of Frenemy's audience really resented Trisha immediately after this episode,

1084
01:17:05,100 --> 01:17:09,100
particularly given that Dr Drew's advice seems slanted in their favour,

1085
01:17:09,100 --> 01:17:12,100
but I find it hard to blame them in many ways for the actual advice they received.

1086
01:17:12,100 --> 01:17:15,100
The buck stops at self-proclaimed experts in this case,

1087
01:17:15,100 --> 01:17:17,100
and it's not like they're completely in the wrong.

1088
01:17:17,100 --> 01:17:22,100
Trisha does deserve sympathy, but just not in a way that invalidates how Ethan feels.

1089
01:17:22,100 --> 01:17:27,100
If Ethan was the therapist type, then maybe he'd be able to handle Trisha in a way that doesn't affect him,

1090
01:17:27,100 --> 01:17:31,100
but he's clearly bothered by Trisha's behaviour because Ethan is not a therapist.

1091
01:17:31,100 --> 01:17:33,100
In fact, sometimes he can be quite the opposite.

1092
01:17:33,100 --> 01:17:37,100
H3 is a hypocrite, because he said n***a on his podcast.

1093
01:17:37,100 --> 01:17:42,100
It's like, dude, you are fucking, you call yourself a news source, like get fucking real.

1094
01:17:42,100 --> 01:17:47,100
You know what, if you think I'm wrong, if you think that I'm a racist and a hypocrite,

1095
01:17:47,100 --> 01:17:51,100
if you didn't bother to watch the podcast and you downvoted and you left a mean comment

1096
01:17:51,100 --> 01:17:54,100
and you called me a hypocrite, fuck off.

1097
01:17:54,100 --> 01:17:56,100
Unsubscribe.

1098
01:17:56,100 --> 01:17:58,100
Don't watch.

1099
01:17:58,100 --> 01:18:01,100
Because we'll have a lot less of that shit to deal with in the future.

1100
01:18:01,100 --> 01:18:04,100
Team Star, the pinnacle of logic and sanity on YouTube.

1101
01:18:04,100 --> 01:18:06,100
I have a strange relationship with Ethan Klein.

1102
01:18:06,100 --> 01:18:09,100
I was always a massive fan of his work with H3H3 Productions,

1103
01:18:09,100 --> 01:18:13,100
and I don't think my appreciation for his content has ever fully dissipated,

1104
01:18:13,100 --> 01:18:18,100
but I do think the podcast kinda revealed to me that he had a few more layers than those which were displayed on the original channel,

1105
01:18:18,100 --> 01:18:21,100
and in a way, it's not exactly a massive surprise.

1106
01:18:21,100 --> 01:18:24,100
He always had the ability to be quite pointed towards people,

1107
01:18:24,100 --> 01:18:26,100
I mean, that's how he first came into conflict with Trisha,

1108
01:18:26,100 --> 01:18:29,100
but when it's in that environment, you can always write it off as comedy.

1109
01:18:29,100 --> 01:18:34,100
On the podcast, it didn't always feel like that, it can come across as quite cynical and trenchant.

1110
01:18:34,100 --> 01:18:37,100
I think sometimes that can provoke people, mostly people who aren't there,

1111
01:18:37,100 --> 01:18:40,100
but still, if you're doing a podcast with a person who is easily provoked,

1112
01:18:40,100 --> 01:18:42,100
then maybe you should be more considerate,

1113
01:18:42,100 --> 01:18:46,100
but at the same time, you also need to retain some sort of sense of self,

1114
01:18:46,100 --> 01:18:48,100
otherwise you're gonna be holding yourself back,

1115
01:18:48,100 --> 01:18:52,100
and I think the challenge posed to Ethan after this episode was one of great magnitude,

1116
01:18:52,100 --> 01:18:55,100
yet although I've made it clear that I think Dr Drew's advice was subpar,

1117
01:18:55,100 --> 01:18:59,100
I think Ethan seemed to find his own resolution that worked quite well for a bit.

1118
01:19:00,100 --> 01:19:06,100
What we have here today is the steamies, as if drinking the piping hot steamy tea.

1119
01:19:06,100 --> 01:19:08,100
Oh, I thought it was like a steamy dump.

1120
01:19:08,100 --> 01:19:11,100
Yeah, that also went through my head.

1121
01:19:11,100 --> 01:19:14,100
You can think of it either way, it's a steamy dump, it's a steamy tea.

1122
01:19:14,100 --> 01:19:20,100
What it is, is the real award show of 2020 that you wish was here,

1123
01:19:20,100 --> 01:19:24,100
but the steamies are too much cowards to actually cover what matters.

1124
01:19:24,100 --> 01:19:29,100
The next episode after Dr Drew was the steamies, a self acclaimed honest spin on the streamies,

1125
01:19:29,100 --> 01:19:33,100
an award show where all the fantastic influencers celebrate their successes.

1126
01:19:33,100 --> 01:19:36,100
However, in the steamies, these awards were a bit more ironic,

1127
01:19:36,100 --> 01:19:41,100
with Trisha even being in attendance to pick out their award for the most dramatic creator,

1128
01:19:41,100 --> 01:19:42,100
what a coincidence.

1129
01:19:43,100 --> 01:19:48,100
47.1% Trisha Banks!

1130
01:19:48,100 --> 01:19:51,100
Wow, you won, here it is.

1131
01:19:51,100 --> 01:19:58,100
Most dramatic creator of the year, they love you, they really love you.

1132
01:19:59,100 --> 01:20:13,100
And we have a very own Frenemies styled rhinestones steamies presented to you.

1133
01:20:13,100 --> 01:20:20,100
We're going to have to get this engraved for Trisha Paytas, most dramatic creator of 2020.

1134
01:20:20,100 --> 01:20:21,100
Congratulations.

1135
01:20:21,100 --> 01:20:24,100
Their first video of the new year seemed to follow in a similar direction,

1136
01:20:24,100 --> 01:20:26,100
and it helped they have the substance to work with.

1137
01:20:26,100 --> 01:20:29,100
Frenemies is under attack, that's going to be the title, it's going to be really good.

1138
01:20:29,100 --> 01:20:31,100
Frenemies is under attack, okay I like that.

1139
01:20:31,100 --> 01:20:33,100
It's true though, it's true.

1140
01:20:33,100 --> 01:20:37,100
Most two of YouTube's most controversial personalities is creating new conversations about mental health.

1141
01:20:37,100 --> 01:20:39,100
That sounds good, right?

1142
01:20:39,100 --> 01:20:44,100
I don't like being a poster child for like mental health, all of a sudden it's like BPG and mental health.

1143
01:20:44,100 --> 01:20:47,100
I agree, I don't like it either, we're just two friends doing a podcast.

1144
01:20:47,100 --> 01:20:50,100
I did watch your H3 live a little bit about someone saying like,

1145
01:20:50,100 --> 01:20:55,100
I just hate that that's what it's about, like how dare he collab with a girl with a mental health issues.

1146
01:20:55,100 --> 01:20:58,100
It's not like I killed somebody and I should be like locked in prison forever.

1147
01:20:58,100 --> 01:21:02,100
You see, over the Christmas parade, their squabbles and subsequent attempts to patch it up

1148
01:21:02,100 --> 01:21:04,100
had caught the eye of certain publications and creators,

1149
01:21:04,100 --> 01:21:08,100
who felt that the content published on the Frenemies podcast bordered on exploited.

1150
01:21:08,100 --> 01:21:13,100
Ethan as the chief organiser of topics comes in with the spin that Frenemies is under attack,

1151
01:21:13,100 --> 01:21:17,100
maybe a bit hyperbolic, but it provides a springboard for them to reinforce their bond.

1152
01:21:17,100 --> 01:21:20,100
I think in this case it works, uniting them around a cause.

1153
01:21:20,100 --> 01:21:23,100
Ethan also goes out of his way to reassure and support Trisha.

1154
01:21:23,100 --> 01:21:25,100
A lot of people really appreciated this,

1155
01:21:25,100 --> 01:21:30,100
they used this momentum to transition into a really good segment in it where they just watch old clips of Trisha on TV,

1156
01:21:30,100 --> 01:21:35,100
something that I absolutely adore, maybe it's just my love of game shows, but it's really wholesome.

1157
01:21:35,100 --> 01:21:37,100
The entire episode is actually quite great,

1158
01:21:37,100 --> 01:21:41,100
and many people commented how refreshing it was that they genuinely seemed like friends here,

1159
01:21:41,100 --> 01:21:46,100
and I began to think, maybe Dr Drew's advice wasn't the best, maybe his tone was too blase for most,

1160
01:21:46,100 --> 01:21:51,100
but maybe it's what made Trisha the happiest, maybe it's what made them the most confident going into the podcast,

1161
01:21:51,100 --> 01:21:56,100
and maybe it provided a sense of resolution on that identity issue that they had expressed conflict over.

1162
01:21:56,100 --> 01:22:01,100
Therapy isn't a one-size-fits-all method, and if Ethan's main goal was to keep the podcast going,

1163
01:22:01,100 --> 01:22:06,100
and he still seemed to have a good time, then who was I to judge? Maybe I was being too critical.

1164
01:22:06,100 --> 01:22:09,100
Yeah, they're like, if you touch her, you'll be escorted off, like mid-show, we don't care.

1165
01:22:09,100 --> 01:22:12,100
I was like, okay, and then I touched your own ass, and I was like, oh no!

1166
01:22:12,100 --> 01:22:16,100
What a diva, you're just Ellen, you're just a TV host, you're not the fucking queen.

1167
01:22:16,100 --> 01:22:17,100
I know, I was so nervous.

1168
01:22:17,100 --> 01:22:20,100
Wait, I didn't, okay, see, this is great, I'm glad we're doing this.

1169
01:22:20,100 --> 01:22:25,100
The episodes after this seem to be continuing in this vein, and people actually seem to be preferring this style.

1170
01:22:25,100 --> 01:22:28,100
It still seemed pretty sharp and witty, but what a change.

1171
01:22:28,100 --> 01:22:29,100
What about all the Beatles?

1172
01:22:29,100 --> 01:22:32,100
Well, I think John Lennon's the only one that said that they're bigger than God.

1173
01:22:32,100 --> 01:22:34,100
They all corroborate with it.

1174
01:22:34,100 --> 01:22:36,100
To be honest, they kinda are bigger than God.

1175
01:22:36,100 --> 01:22:40,100
I think God is the biggest.

1176
01:22:40,100 --> 01:22:43,100
Okay, name one song he's made.

1177
01:22:43,100 --> 01:22:45,100
Well, not much on the surface.

1178
01:22:45,100 --> 01:22:51,100
Ethan didn't seem to become a shell of himself like some were probably worried, and Trisha seemed a lot more optimistic going into the new year.

1179
01:22:51,100 --> 01:22:56,100
However, I do think the awards show illustrated one of Ethan and Trisha's greatest combined strengths,

1180
01:22:56,100 --> 01:23:02,100
that although their spontaneity had its own appeal, they worked their best when they were building off and reacting to other material.

1181
01:23:02,100 --> 01:23:09,100
It's a very simple observation at its core, but all of the worst arguments seem to begin when Ethan and Trisha become too fixated on themselves,

1182
01:23:09,100 --> 01:23:14,100
and their own conduct, procedure, and sometimes that of the podcast and those close to them in the moment,

1183
01:23:14,100 --> 01:23:16,100
typically when one of them took it personally.

1184
01:23:16,100 --> 01:23:21,100
Sometimes it's a hard discussion to avoid, given Trisha's nature to go off on tangents about their personal life.

1185
01:23:21,100 --> 01:23:25,100
Nonetheless, I think that Ethan came into 2021 with a refreshed sense of focus.

1186
01:23:25,100 --> 01:23:30,100
Although they both were still somewhat easily distracted, he would often bring the video back to the core thesis.

1187
01:23:30,100 --> 01:23:36,100
He didn't allow himself to be pulled away towards subjects that could lead down a problematic path, and I think that was definitely beneficial.

1188
01:23:36,100 --> 01:23:41,100
I also think that with the new year and the new drama, there was a new purpose.

1189
01:23:41,100 --> 01:23:46,100
Things seemed to be looking up for once, and whoever was responsible for it should have given themselves a pat on the back.

1190
01:23:46,100 --> 01:23:52,100
Maybe Dr Drew was the therapist we didn't want, or the therapist we needed, but were we missing something?

1191
01:24:04,100 --> 01:24:09,100
Here's the thing, there were a lot of theories at the time that Trisha and Ethan played up that drama for the camera,

1192
01:24:09,100 --> 01:24:12,100
which is in a way what they were responding to that episode.

1193
01:24:12,100 --> 01:24:17,100
Some believed there was a financial incentive to do so, and it's not like that theory holds no water,

1194
01:24:17,100 --> 01:24:20,100
those moments did tend to receive more publicity from the podcast and other sources,

1195
01:24:20,100 --> 01:24:25,100
but they were so successful without that conflict, it wasn't necessary for their collaboration subsistence,

1196
01:24:25,100 --> 01:24:32,100
and often with the fate of the podcast on the line, it's not a boundary worth pushing, the long term trade-off was not worth it.

1197
01:24:32,100 --> 01:24:38,100
If anything, the content at the start of 2021 showed that frenemies have the ability to be just as successful without hostility,

1198
01:24:38,100 --> 01:24:45,100
and I think this movement towards a more cemented friendship was almost enough in itself, and very satisfying for audience members to watch.

1199
01:24:45,100 --> 01:24:52,100
Now make no mistake, they were also helped by an influx of drama which covered creators that Trisha and Ethan both had interactions and history with,

1200
01:24:52,100 --> 01:24:58,100
ranging from Shane to David Dobrik to James Charles, and when pickings were this plentiful, they didn't have to skimp out on topics.

1201
01:24:59,100 --> 01:25:02,100
She was upset that I was going to make out with Seth, and so I flipped out.

1202
01:25:02,100 --> 01:25:10,100
You being mad about the Seth make out thing is crazy. It's crazy. It's crazy.

1203
01:25:10,100 --> 01:25:11,100
Is it?

1204
01:25:12,100 --> 01:25:15,100
Was that real? Like him saying it's crazy three times, or is that edited?

1205
01:25:15,100 --> 01:25:17,100
No, that's the clip, unedited.

1206
01:25:20,100 --> 01:25:24,100
Not being comfortable with it, and here's the footage, and not only you saying you're not comfortable with it,

1207
01:25:24,100 --> 01:25:30,100
but David was, I mean, look, people misuse gaslighting all the time, this is gaslighting.

1208
01:25:30,100 --> 01:25:31,100
Right, right, right.

1209
01:25:31,100 --> 01:25:34,100
Because you know something's wrong, and he's trying to convince you that you're crazy.

1210
01:25:34,100 --> 01:25:35,100
Right.

1211
01:25:35,100 --> 01:25:40,100
However, this didn't mean that they didn't share more personal moments or tackle difficult subjects.

1212
01:25:40,100 --> 01:25:43,100
In fact, as I've shown, Ethan really went out of his way to support Trisha.

1213
01:25:43,100 --> 01:25:49,100
They even had an episode where Trisha spoke about many of their struggles growing up, which at the time seemed pretty riveting.

1214
01:25:49,100 --> 01:25:56,100
We weren't close. My dad was in California when we lived in Illinois, and my mom, I had issues with my stepdad, so that was my main focus.

1215
01:25:56,100 --> 01:26:02,100
Well, not my stepdad, one of her boyfriends, and so that was my main focus at home, and then I tried to say stuff, and then I was like, oh, I'm not going to say anything.

1216
01:26:02,100 --> 01:26:05,100
My mom worked for a job, so we were by ourselves all the time.

1217
01:26:05,100 --> 01:26:08,100
She worked at the country club. She was a bus driver. She was a substitute teacher.

1218
01:26:08,100 --> 01:26:13,100
She worked so much, and so her boyfriends would be home or whatever, but it was bad.

1219
01:26:13,100 --> 01:26:18,100
It was, you know, I thought if my own principal doesn't believe me, no one's going to believe me.

1220
01:26:18,100 --> 01:26:21,100
You're not a pathological liar anymore.

1221
01:26:21,100 --> 01:26:23,100
Pathological? What's that?

1222
01:26:23,100 --> 01:26:25,100
You said you're a chronic liar.

1223
01:26:25,100 --> 01:26:28,100
Oh, like you think I'm lying about this now? No, I'm not lying about it.

1224
01:26:28,100 --> 01:26:33,100
I just am asking because I know people are going to be like, she admits she's a pathological liar, and you can't trust anything she says.

1225
01:26:33,100 --> 01:26:37,100
Um, like when I was younger, but I'm not now. I don't lie. I make a really conscious effort to not...

1226
01:26:37,100 --> 01:26:39,100
I believe everything you say. I don't think you're a liar.

1227
01:26:39,100 --> 01:26:44,100
Many people really felt like Trisha was beginning to change as a person, and in a way, they definitely were.

1228
01:26:44,100 --> 01:26:51,100
They were being nice to Ethan, tolerating his assertive comments, saying a lot of genuinely sweet things that many viewers found legitimately endearing.

1229
01:26:51,100 --> 01:26:55,100
However, I'll bring it back to Dr Drew, and the notion of mutual change that I felt was a bit neglected.

1230
01:26:55,100 --> 01:26:59,100
At the end of the day, Ethan certainly was capable of doing more to accommodate Trisha,

1231
01:26:59,100 --> 01:27:04,100
and if you would rather cater to Trish than ask more of them to keep the podcast going, then I think that's justified.

1232
01:27:04,100 --> 01:27:08,100
But there was still one element that I think Trish needed to provide, and that was trust.

1233
01:27:09,100 --> 01:27:15,100
I think my trust with, like, influencers in general, like, I really thought they were my friends, so when you kept being like,

1234
01:27:15,100 --> 01:27:20,100
I'm here for you, I'm your friend, and I was like, uh, you know what I mean? I feel like maybe a lot of that is...

1235
01:27:20,100 --> 01:27:24,100
I think there's plenty of other things that caused trauma in your life before that, though.

1236
01:27:24,100 --> 01:27:28,100
I think that they really... I went to a mental hospital for the first time in my life after David and Jason.

1237
01:27:28,100 --> 01:27:34,100
It should be no surprise that with their history and their dispositions, Trisha isn't a very trusting person,

1238
01:27:34,100 --> 01:27:41,100
and in a way, it's not like I blame them. I think it's very difficult to trust people when you've had that trust abused in the way that Trisha seems to express it.

1239
01:27:41,100 --> 01:27:46,100
However, Ethan isn't like those other people, and I have my problems with Ethan, make no mistake,

1240
01:27:46,100 --> 01:27:52,100
but sometimes a weakness can also be a strength, and one of my criticisms is that Ethan can play favourites a little too much.

1241
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:58,100
Now everyone is biased, however, I think Ethan is unreasonably harsh towards some people, and far too lenient with others.

1242
01:27:58,100 --> 01:28:05,100
Particularly in the episodes where they were covering drama, Ethan really used an aspect of himself to go at many people Trisha had expressed issues with,

1243
01:28:05,100 --> 01:28:12,100
really asserting his loyalty, but Pater's reaction often showed there was still an inkling of doubters to Ethan's sincerity.

1244
01:28:12,100 --> 01:28:20,100
It always just fell short of the heartfelt moment, at which point you began to wonder if there was anything Ethan could do to break through.

1245
01:28:20,100 --> 01:28:39,100
Trisha isn't a stranger to making sassy comments, but they always seemed like a way to shift the tone of a conversation

1246
01:28:39,100 --> 01:28:44,100
and prevent themselves from showing that vulnerability and trust that may allow someone like Klein in.

1247
01:28:44,100 --> 01:28:49,100
You could tell their wall was built high, and in a normal world, many would say that this is profoundly illogical.

1248
01:28:49,100 --> 01:28:56,100
Even if you loathe Ethan, all logical roots would point towards his desire to maintain good terms with Trisha, beyond the podcast as well.

1249
01:28:56,100 --> 01:29:01,100
The personal investment was significant, especially given Trisha was now Moses's fiance.

1250
01:29:01,100 --> 01:29:05,100
Hell, they even did a whole couples episode, with Hila making an appearance as well.

1251
01:29:05,100 --> 01:29:08,100
Alright, Ethan and Trisha first.

1252
01:29:35,100 --> 01:29:45,100
In many senses, Ethan was bending over backwards to stand up for Trisha.

1253
01:29:45,100 --> 01:29:50,100
He gave them a platform to speak on certain matters, he believed them, he advocated for them at every opportunity.

1254
01:29:50,100 --> 01:29:55,100
This caused backlash of points, particularly when he went toe to toe with other creators over dramatic matters,

1255
01:29:55,100 --> 01:30:02,100
particularly when people didn't believe Trisha's testimonies, which outside of the H3 fanbase was still a significant online presence.

1256
01:30:02,100 --> 01:30:07,100
In numerous episodes where David Debrick and the Vlog Squad are addressed, Trisha has a lot of history and baggage with them,

1257
01:30:07,100 --> 01:30:11,100
and much of that is aired to the point where Trisha claimed that lawyers were becoming evil.

1258
01:30:33,100 --> 01:30:48,100
Ethan was prepared to antagonise himself to certain audiences if it meant backing his partners,

1259
01:30:48,100 --> 01:30:54,100
with Skep soon billing him as opportunistic and only siding with Trisha because of their status and the revenue it brought.

1260
01:30:54,100 --> 01:30:59,100
Now, I'll give my own subjective opinion on it in due time, but it was divisive then,

1261
01:30:59,100 --> 01:31:05,100
but between that divide, Ethan sided with Trisha. Was Trisha completely on Ethan's side?

1262
01:31:05,100 --> 01:31:22,100
Well, in episode 29 there's this interesting interaction where Ethan makes a comment directed towards Trisha about their weight.

1263
01:31:22,100 --> 01:31:28,100
Trisha then retorts by insulting his hair, this then leads into a rather elongated discussion about which one of them is fatter,

1264
01:31:28,100 --> 01:31:37,100
all in all it seems like a pretty inconsequential conversation, until around 40 minutes later when Trisha decides to retract their statement and apologise for their previous comment.

1265
01:31:58,100 --> 01:32:04,100
At that moment it seems like quite a nice gesture, but there's a catch.

1266
01:32:29,100 --> 01:32:33,100
Now, if you believe that Ethan should have apologised for his comment then fair enough,

1267
01:32:33,100 --> 01:32:37,100
but it's a strange situation because those sorts of jokes never seemed off-limit prior,

1268
01:32:37,100 --> 01:32:43,100
and as Ethan points out, the expectation that someone else should apologise for something isn't a good motive for an apology.

1269
01:32:43,100 --> 01:32:48,100
The point is though that he didn't apologise, and there's a moment of awkwardness while Trisha processes Ethan's response,

1270
01:32:48,100 --> 01:32:52,100
and you just have this feeling that something still isn't quite there for them.

1271
01:32:52,100 --> 01:32:58,100
Ethan was only prepared to compromise on so much, and it was unclear whether Trisha was fully satisfied with that.

1272
01:32:58,100 --> 01:33:02,100
The End

1273
01:33:15,100 --> 01:33:18,100
With acknowledgement to the previous part and everything life said in it,

1274
01:33:18,100 --> 01:33:23,100
The Frenemies episode still seemed headed in the right direction, with an energy that did become more positive.

1275
01:33:23,100 --> 01:33:27,100
It still seemed viable that Trisha would finally settle in the place that they were,

1276
01:33:27,100 --> 01:33:33,100
with the people they were with. The absence of those more large-scale conflicts would make many believe we were perhaps

1277
01:33:33,100 --> 01:33:38,100
approaching calmer waters, and no one could really be blamed for expecting anything else.

1278
01:33:38,100 --> 01:33:42,100
At the start of episode 37, Trisha seems in rather high spirits.

1279
01:33:42,100 --> 01:33:47,100
They mention that there had been an argument with Klein, but both parties express reluctance to delve into details,

1280
01:33:47,100 --> 01:33:52,100
and they seem happy to move on from it. Maybe people noted how exuberant Trisha was during this episode,

1281
01:33:52,100 --> 01:33:54,100
maybe even a bit too exuberant.

1282
01:33:55,100 --> 01:34:00,100
So anyway guys, head on over to Trisha, or sadboy2005.com

1283
01:34:00,100 --> 01:34:05,100
This is our first collab, we have four more collabs coming out this year, and then we're gonna start our own in-house stuff.

1284
01:34:05,100 --> 01:34:11,100
Daddy First is definitely an inspiration. I've always wanted to do a clothing line, but I never saw anyone do it.

1285
01:34:11,100 --> 01:34:15,100
Not that it's easy, but seeing you guys do it, I was like, this could be attainable. You know what I mean?

1286
01:34:15,100 --> 01:34:20,100
I feel like, I don't know. Anyways, I'm really excited. I feel like the quality is good.

1287
01:34:20,100 --> 01:34:25,100
Everything's hand stitched, hand printed, like this is hand dyed, this is hand sprayed on, yeah.

1288
01:34:25,100 --> 01:34:28,100
They dyed this, this purple and blue.

1289
01:34:30,100 --> 01:34:35,100
Someone questioned a few of the comments made during this podcast on whether they were completely alright,

1290
01:34:35,100 --> 01:34:38,100
with someone wondering if they were having a manic episode.

1291
01:34:38,100 --> 01:34:44,100
Regardless, as good as their mood appeared to be, there was one talking point they did briefly stop on.

1292
01:34:45,100 --> 01:34:49,100
They're about they're about equal kind of a point for me. Oh, my God.

1293
01:34:52,100 --> 01:35:05,100
Technically, we because you didn't actually anyways, you know, I pay logistic, but you get a little extra from front of me said to pay the crew. So we pay them for Mondays. You did tell me that. Oh, so I pay them to from our earnings of interesting.

1294
01:35:06,100 --> 01:35:14,100
The arrangement between the two split the podcast profits 55% to 45% in Ethan's favour, with 5% going towards production costs.

1295
01:35:14,100 --> 01:35:19,100
In exchange, Ethan also claims that he organises the episodes and does the rest of the work.

1296
01:35:19,100 --> 01:35:27,100
Trisha decides that this isn't really a topic for discussion right now, and although Ethan persists a little longer, the conversation subsides shortly after.

1297
01:35:27,100 --> 01:35:32,100
It seems like a mostly trifling detour, one of many, but I'll put a pin in it for future reference.

1298
01:35:32,100 --> 01:35:40,100
The next episode is a mostly entertaining, albeit uneventful vlog, where Trisha continues to impress people with their encyclopedic knowledge of Hollywood.

1299
01:35:50,100 --> 01:35:59,100
They're actually right, fair play. Anyhow, I digress, though once again Trisha does scold Ethan for not coming in costume, it all seems fairly friendly, and I shan't dwell on it.

1300
01:35:59,100 --> 01:36:02,100
I think we should turn our attention to the next episode.

1301
01:36:16,100 --> 01:36:22,100
In this episode there is a pretty significant development in the client's personal life, that being that Hila is now pregnant.

1302
01:36:22,100 --> 01:36:30,100
The podcast's reaction seems fairly elated, and Trisha seems equally excited for the both of them, even being surprisingly self-aware about their emotional response to the news.

1303
01:36:30,100 --> 01:36:52,100
I think a lot of people have retrospectively tried to read into Trisha's response here, but honestly nothing seems particularly out of the ordinary.

1304
01:36:52,100 --> 01:36:59,100
Trisha seems pretty hyped about the release of their new music video, which is an homage to My Chemical Romance, and it was Pride Month as well.

1305
01:37:00,100 --> 01:37:07,100
Maybe everything was turning out just as we had hoped, two couples, both happy and healthy, making their way in the world and rooting for each other.

1306
01:37:07,100 --> 01:37:14,100
In spite of all the uncertainty, this may have been the completion of the arc that we had followed, but not all endings are as happy as we'd like them to be.

1307
01:37:14,100 --> 01:37:19,100
It's difficult when you're watching these videos at that moment to really know exactly what's going on between them,

1308
01:37:19,100 --> 01:37:24,100
and it was completely understandable that people had the impression that Ethan and Trisha were consolidating their friendship.

1309
01:37:24,100 --> 01:37:28,100
The topics yielded a lot of unifying moments, and they seemed closer than ever in many ways.

1310
01:37:28,100 --> 01:37:32,100
The incidents that I have picked out in the previous part didn't happen on a rather regular basis,

1311
01:37:32,100 --> 01:37:37,100
but they still underlined that failure to take the final step to put that trust in Ethan's hand.

1312
01:37:37,100 --> 01:37:43,100
There was still that doubt as to whether Ethan could give Trisha what they wanted, but what did Trisha want?

1313
01:37:43,100 --> 01:37:58,100
One point that I've covered a while back was one of Trisha's first appearances on the podcast.

1314
01:37:58,100 --> 01:38:08,100
They've always had a slightly strange dynamic with Ethan often switching between an I hate you stick and an off-puttingly flirtatious vibe that wasn't always met with approval by those who interacted with it.

1315
01:38:13,100 --> 01:38:40,100
Now, I'm not here to say that I think Trisha ever hailed strong feelings for Ethan, although some people hypothesised it.

1316
01:38:40,100 --> 01:38:44,100
I think their often quirky behaviour in that domain could be put down to past interactions.

1317
01:38:44,100 --> 01:38:51,100
At the same time, I think there was definitely an expectation that at that point of the podcast, they would be the priority.

1318
01:38:51,100 --> 01:38:56,100
I don't mean this in a romantic sense, but I think as they became more and more familiar with each other,

1319
01:38:56,100 --> 01:39:01,100
Trisha seemed to develop a belief that they would have more influence on the general identity of the podcast itself,

1320
01:39:01,100 --> 01:39:05,100
and they would be able to direct it rather than being this guest for hire.

1321
01:39:05,100 --> 01:39:11,100
Trisha is an extremely distrusting person, and wherever there was something that seemed to bother them, some discrepancy in their mind,

1322
01:39:11,100 --> 01:39:16,100
they would use it to fuel their own doubts, and to cut themselves loose from the person that they believed to be the source of that.

1323
01:39:16,100 --> 01:39:23,100
I think Trisha, like many people, almost became enslaved by their own expectation, that expectation for the podcast to crash and burn.

1324
01:39:23,100 --> 01:39:28,100
Every now and then they'd make these comments that invited Ethan to rise to the insult, or escalate them even,

1325
01:39:28,100 --> 01:39:34,100
in a way that would provide them with some justification of completely severing that tie, freeing them from the obligation.

1326
01:39:34,100 --> 01:39:38,100
It was a technique that often died down, and was even sometimes resolved shortly after,

1327
01:39:38,100 --> 01:39:45,100
but if the mood was right, or wrong even, it was the sort of thing that could spiral, and in episode 39, it did.

1328
01:39:45,100 --> 01:39:51,100
Alright, so anyway, I mentioned the name of the person who's finally ready to talk about Gabbie Hanna today.

1329
01:39:51,100 --> 01:39:54,100
Talking about Gabbie Hanna, what could possibly go wrong?

1330
01:39:56,100 --> 01:40:02,100
Unlike other episodes with instants, what we were about to witness wasn't immediately apparent judging by the thumbnail and title.

1331
01:40:02,100 --> 01:40:06,100
This may be due to the fact that Ethan didn't want to make it seem like he was cashing in on the conflict,

1332
01:40:06,100 --> 01:40:12,100
or perhaps because Ethan didn't view it as second to the much more prominent conversation relating to the titular subject,

1333
01:40:12,100 --> 01:40:16,100
Gabbie Hanna, a person who may have helped bring Trisha and Ethan together in the first place.

1334
01:40:16,100 --> 01:40:20,100
Episode 39 starts like many episodes do, unexceptionally.

1335
01:40:20,100 --> 01:40:25,100
Trisha doesn't seem to be quite as energised as previous episodes, but it's not out of the realms of normality.

1336
01:40:25,100 --> 01:40:28,100
Ethan is ominously dressed in an unconfessed costume again,

1337
01:40:28,100 --> 01:40:33,100
have barely a few minutes in, and Trisha is already dissatisfied at the affairs relating to their costumes,

1338
01:40:33,100 --> 01:40:36,100
seemingly frustrated by the lack of control they have over its selection.

1339
01:40:59,100 --> 01:41:05,100
This goes on for a couple minutes before they reach some sort of resolution where Ethan commits to doing more Trisha's costume suggestions,

1340
01:41:05,100 --> 01:41:08,100
and the next half an hour passes without major incident,

1341
01:41:08,100 --> 01:41:12,100
though Trisha does make a few comments towards Ethan about the procedure of the podcast.

1342
01:41:23,100 --> 01:41:26,100
However, one comment in particular that should have set up some red flags was this one.

1343
01:41:29,100 --> 01:41:44,100
Here Trisha is setting a mark up, they are not in a good mood, they have a lot of hate in their hearts,

1344
01:41:44,100 --> 01:41:48,100
and at that point Ethan tries to ease any tension by jovially reassuring Trisha,

1345
01:41:48,100 --> 01:41:51,100
though they don't seem particularly heartened by his attempts.

1346
01:41:51,100 --> 01:41:54,100
There's a skit shortly after which seems to cut through any agitation in the moment,

1347
01:41:54,100 --> 01:41:58,100
but the topic of Gabbie Hanna, someone who Trisha has only stated they do not really like to discuss typically,

1348
01:41:58,100 --> 01:42:01,100
given they believe Gabbie is stalking them, is a bold choice.

1349
01:42:01,100 --> 01:42:04,100
It certainly seems to play into their sense of paranoia,

1350
01:42:15,100 --> 01:42:21,100
how the conversation manages to tangentially end up at the ever-popular topic of pizza, and they bond over that.

1351
01:42:21,100 --> 01:42:24,100
It seems the mood has been restored, and all is well once more,

1352
01:42:24,100 --> 01:42:29,100
but then we cut to the ad segment, and we notice an empty chair alongside our festery friend.

1353
01:42:29,100 --> 01:42:32,100
He explains the situation, and he doesn't seem too distraught about it,

1354
01:42:32,100 --> 01:42:36,100
describing the incident as a little blowout, and proceeding with the routine ad reads.

1355
01:42:36,100 --> 01:42:41,100
However, regardless of the scale of this clash, it was obviously a departure from the conflict-free record,

1356
01:42:41,100 --> 01:42:44,100
and many were left anticipating the inevitable, and what exactly would spawn it.

1357
01:42:44,100 --> 01:42:49,100
While the topic of Gabbie Hanna continues, and while they both seem to have some sort of rational grasp on the topic,

1358
01:42:49,100 --> 01:42:52,100
they do venture through some subjects that Trisha clearly finds triggering,

1359
01:42:52,100 --> 01:42:56,100
particularly regarding an interview which they felt wasn't completely in good faith.

1360
01:42:56,100 --> 01:42:59,100
Trisha seems to take this quite seriously, but also quite soberly,

1361
01:42:59,100 --> 01:43:01,100
and Ethan provides his standard support,

1362
01:43:01,100 --> 01:43:06,100
though they do seem to dwell on points that may be considered a little morbid for someone of Trisha's paranoid disposition,

1363
01:43:06,100 --> 01:43:08,100
perhaps not the best choice.

1364
01:43:08,100 --> 01:43:11,100
We can't, there's no steamy nomination for her either, we cannot mention her ever again.

1365
01:43:11,100 --> 01:43:13,100
Most likely to assassinate Trisha Paytas.

1366
01:43:13,100 --> 01:43:14,100
Stop!

1367
01:43:14,100 --> 01:43:15,100
And the winner is...

1368
01:43:15,100 --> 01:43:18,100
And then we invite her up, and we give her a knife as a reward.

1369
01:43:18,100 --> 01:43:22,100
Stop! That's why I bring security, I have security guards that come with me everywhere, I'm not kidding.

1370
01:43:22,100 --> 01:43:24,100
She will show up.

1371
01:43:24,100 --> 01:43:27,100
Most likely to kill Trisha with this knife.

1372
01:43:27,100 --> 01:43:28,100
So scary.

1373
01:43:28,100 --> 01:43:33,100
With all that said, there is the idea that Trisha being able to vent may have been able to lift that weight off their shoulders,

1374
01:43:33,100 --> 01:43:36,100
and they seem to express this sentiment of greater stability as well,

1375
01:43:36,100 --> 01:43:38,100
since cutting certain toxic people out of their life.

1376
01:43:38,100 --> 01:43:43,100
Even my aura, my stability in my mind, the fact that I can handle triggers.

1377
01:43:43,100 --> 01:43:44,100
Good auras.

1378
01:43:44,100 --> 01:43:48,100
Do you know what I mean? Yeah, and I've gone to therapy, I've been going to therapy since 2019, so you could say therapy,

1379
01:43:48,100 --> 01:43:53,100
but at the same time, I'm like, I really think since I really left that, everything's been so much better.

1380
01:43:53,100 --> 01:43:54,100
Very interesting.

1381
01:43:54,100 --> 01:43:57,100
Yeah, everything, like health, like money, like everything just flows friendships.

1382
01:43:57,100 --> 01:44:01,100
But then, not too soon after the pizzas arrived, there were signs of discontent.

1383
01:44:01,100 --> 01:44:06,100
No, I got black olives, pineapple, and jalapeno, and it's insane. So good.

1384
01:44:06,100 --> 01:44:11,100
Wait, no, not my discontent, Trisha's discontent, though we are gonna have words about those pineapples, Ethan.

1385
01:44:11,100 --> 01:44:15,100
No, the real problem arises when Trisha begins to talk about Brokeback Mountain,

1386
01:44:15,100 --> 01:44:20,100
a romantic drama about two cowboys who've become romantically intertwined in a rather unaccepting environment.

1387
01:44:20,100 --> 01:44:25,100
Trisha was clearly very invested in the plotline, and also the narratives that were still relevant to this day in their mind.

1388
01:44:25,100 --> 01:44:30,100
Ethan, however, becomes a little distracted by the pizza, and the awkwardness radiates through the screen.

1389
01:44:30,100 --> 01:44:33,100
There's still, people are still like that, like trans people arguing feet in their face to death.

1390
01:44:33,100 --> 01:44:35,100
Oh, I'm so over that shit.

1391
01:44:35,100 --> 01:44:43,100
And so like watching it, I was just like holy shit, and like Heath Ledger, Jake Gyllenhaal said Heath Ledger refused to make like gay jokes about it like during the Oscars, and I don't know.

1392
01:44:43,100 --> 01:44:44,100
Is there a third pizza?

1393
01:44:44,100 --> 01:44:46,100
You're so not good about this.

1394
01:44:46,100 --> 01:44:48,100
I just want to make sure that everyone got pizza.

1395
01:44:48,100 --> 01:44:50,100
I don't like this segment, just for the record, fan advice is so stupid.

1396
01:44:50,100 --> 01:44:54,100
It's a little rude on Ethan's part given the subject, but it's nothing that needs to escalate.

1397
01:44:54,100 --> 01:44:57,100
How Patricia, clearly feeling wronged, decides to go in.

1398
01:44:57,100 --> 01:45:02,100
I never pick the costumes, I never do the vlogs, I give so many ideas, I say dancing for the vlogs, I give all these ideas, and you don't.

1399
01:45:02,100 --> 01:45:03,100
What's wrong with the advice?

1400
01:45:03,100 --> 01:45:04,100
I don't think it's a good segment.

1401
01:45:04,100 --> 01:45:05,100
The people want to hear from us.

1402
01:45:05,100 --> 01:45:06,100
Okay, do it.

1403
01:45:06,100 --> 01:45:11,100
I'm telling you my opinion and all the vlogs we've done, I've suggested other vlogs and like that never does.

1404
01:45:11,100 --> 01:45:13,100
Well if you don't like it, then we shouldn't do it.

1405
01:45:13,100 --> 01:45:14,100
Okay.

1406
01:45:14,100 --> 01:45:15,100
In terms of the show about me and you.

1407
01:45:15,100 --> 01:45:17,100
No, but you're saying I do all the work, but I'm telling you I don't like all the stuff you do.

1408
01:45:17,100 --> 01:45:22,100
I'm just kind of go with it because I'm like, okay, I guess this is what you want to do, but I have to start saying no, because some things are just not good ideas.

1409
01:45:22,100 --> 01:45:29,100
Although this feels like a rather dramatic change in tone, you can tell that these are frustrations that have been boiling up, particularly given their prior mentions.

1410
01:45:30,100 --> 01:45:36,100
Although Ethan feels like he does the heavy lifting, Trisha clearly doesn't feel like they've been given the chance to, and is quite blunt about it.

1411
01:45:36,100 --> 01:45:39,100
They also don't think the material for the podcast is original enough.

1412
01:45:39,100 --> 01:45:41,100
But you're asking like, we do all the work.

1413
01:45:41,100 --> 01:45:47,100
It's like we spent one friend of me rehashing all the stuff you said about Keemstar and H3 Live, which was two days prior.

1414
01:45:47,100 --> 01:45:48,100
Okay, it happened one time.

1415
01:45:48,100 --> 01:45:52,100
No, it's happened before where you just like bring up stuff that you already mentioned and it's fine.

1416
01:45:52,100 --> 01:45:53,100
Why are you attacking me?

1417
01:45:53,100 --> 01:45:57,100
You asked me, you said tell me, and I'm telling you like all your, just because you guys come up with everything doesn't mean it's good.

1418
01:45:57,100 --> 01:45:59,100
It's recycled, a lot of it, so it's like I can come up with new ideas.

1419
01:45:59,100 --> 01:46:00,100
Not a lot of it.

1420
01:46:00,100 --> 01:46:01,100
A lot of it.

1421
01:46:01,100 --> 01:46:02,100
No.

1422
01:46:02,100 --> 01:46:03,100
Mm-hmm.

1423
01:46:03,100 --> 01:46:04,100
If you have ideas, I'm all ears.

1424
01:46:04,100 --> 01:46:06,100
I watch H3 Live and we talk about the same thing, and I'm happy to talk about it.

1425
01:46:06,100 --> 01:46:07,100
It's not always like that.

1426
01:46:07,100 --> 01:46:08,100
It's happened before, I agree.

1427
01:46:08,100 --> 01:46:09,100
It happened last time.

1428
01:46:09,100 --> 01:46:10,100
It's happened a lot.

1429
01:46:10,100 --> 01:46:12,100
Sometimes I forget what I've talked about, honestly.

1430
01:46:12,100 --> 01:46:17,100
But you're saying you have all this crew that does all this work for you, and nobody could remember that you talked about that two days prior?

1431
01:46:17,100 --> 01:46:18,100
I agree.

1432
01:46:18,100 --> 01:46:19,100
Somebody should have said something.

1433
01:46:19,100 --> 01:46:22,100
I was like, guys, why don't you tell me when I'm talking about the same shit over and over?

1434
01:46:22,100 --> 01:46:24,100
Because I tell to them, I go, yo, make sure to include this.

1435
01:46:24,100 --> 01:46:27,100
And they go, okay, but I go, oh shit, I talked about the same thing.

1436
01:46:27,100 --> 01:46:33,100
Ethan defends himself on this front, though conceding on one point, while asking Trisha to be a bit more honest with their emotions,

1437
01:46:33,100 --> 01:46:38,100
something which then prolongs this tension, eventually leading into the dreaded discussion surrounding revenue split,

1438
01:46:38,100 --> 01:46:40,100
which once again comes back to the notion of control.

1439
01:46:40,100 --> 01:46:42,100
But I feel like you're so angry about this.

1440
01:46:42,100 --> 01:46:44,100
I'm literally not, but it's so funny.

1441
01:46:44,100 --> 01:46:45,100
At least you are.

1442
01:46:45,100 --> 01:46:46,100
I'm not, I'm angry when you say something.

1443
01:46:46,100 --> 01:46:47,100
You need to admit when you're angry.

1444
01:46:47,100 --> 01:46:49,100
Ethan, I promise you, this really is gaslighting.

1445
01:46:49,100 --> 01:46:51,100
I go to a lot of therapy right now, and this really is.

1446
01:46:51,100 --> 01:46:53,100
When I say I'm not angry, I'm not.

1447
01:46:53,100 --> 01:46:57,100
I'm just trying to tell you that you're like, oh, we do everything for the show, and I'm saying it's not always good.

1448
01:46:57,100 --> 01:46:58,100
I'm not angry.

1449
01:46:58,100 --> 01:47:00,100
If I was angry, I would leave or something, but I'm not.

1450
01:47:00,100 --> 01:47:01,100
But you're telling me I'm angry?

1451
01:47:01,100 --> 01:47:02,100
You're upset or something.

1452
01:47:02,100 --> 01:47:03,100
I'm not.

1453
01:47:03,100 --> 01:47:04,100
People we hire.

1454
01:47:04,100 --> 01:47:06,100
Why would I ask you about people I hire?

1455
01:47:06,100 --> 01:47:08,100
Because it's front of me, and you take the budget for paying for the crew.

1456
01:47:08,100 --> 01:47:09,100
That's what you told me.

1457
01:47:09,100 --> 01:47:11,100
You take highlights, you take 5% to pay the crew.

1458
01:47:11,100 --> 01:47:14,100
So why don't I get any input on the crew or what we do?

1459
01:47:14,100 --> 01:47:16,100
These are employees of our production company.

1460
01:47:16,100 --> 01:47:18,100
So why are you taking highlights and 5% in front of me?

1461
01:47:18,100 --> 01:47:20,100
You told me that it was to pay them.

1462
01:47:20,100 --> 01:47:22,100
It's for production costs.

1463
01:47:22,100 --> 01:47:27,100
Okay, but you told me at the beginning, it's like they could be working on other things.

1464
01:47:27,100 --> 01:47:28,100
So I made that argument, too.

1465
01:47:28,100 --> 01:47:29,100
I'm like, well, they're already age 3.

1466
01:47:29,100 --> 01:47:30,100
Oh, they could be working on other things.

1467
01:47:30,100 --> 01:47:31,100
So I'm like, okay, in that case-

1468
01:47:31,100 --> 01:47:32,100
It's for production costs.

1469
01:47:32,100 --> 01:47:41,100
I take 5% extra from the podcast revenue, and I take the highlights revenue, and everything else we split.

1470
01:47:41,100 --> 01:47:43,100
Right, so for production costs.

1471
01:47:43,100 --> 01:47:45,100
Yeah, and so we had to buy-

1472
01:47:45,100 --> 01:47:47,100
But that was the first time we ever spent money on production costs.

1473
01:47:47,100 --> 01:47:49,100
It's not about that, dude.

1474
01:47:49,100 --> 01:47:52,100
It's literally about we are producing the show, and I'm taking a cut.

1475
01:47:52,100 --> 01:47:54,100
I feel like that's beyond reasonable.

1476
01:47:54,100 --> 01:47:55,100
All the highlights.

1477
01:47:55,100 --> 01:47:56,100
Beyond reasonable.

1478
01:47:56,100 --> 01:47:57,100
5%.

1479
01:47:57,100 --> 01:47:58,100
5%.

1480
01:47:58,100 --> 01:47:59,100
Do you realize how much 5% was of our last one?

1481
01:47:59,100 --> 01:48:00,100
That should be enough.

1482
01:48:00,100 --> 01:48:04,100
But also highlights, and then you weren't the membership I had to fight for because you weren't-

1483
01:48:04,100 --> 01:48:05,100
Oh, I forgot to tell you about the members.

1484
01:48:05,100 --> 01:48:06,100
It's crazy.

1485
01:48:06,100 --> 01:48:08,100
I'm giving you 50% of all the members.

1486
01:48:08,100 --> 01:48:11,100
Trisha seems rather irritated, despite proclaiming that they're not.

1487
01:48:11,100 --> 01:48:16,100
And when Ethan expresses this, it only seems to worsen their mood, with Trisha believing they're being gaslit.

1488
01:48:16,100 --> 01:48:19,100
This then causes them to express doubt regarding Ethan's intentions.

1489
01:48:19,100 --> 01:48:23,100
And then Ethan, once again giving up, concedes that he must have gaslit her.

1490
01:48:23,100 --> 01:48:25,100
Because you can be upset and still show up.

1491
01:48:25,100 --> 01:48:28,100
But I'm not upset, and that's what gaslighting is, because you're saying I'm gaslighting you by saying-

1492
01:48:28,100 --> 01:48:30,100
I'm gaslighting you. You're not upset. You're perfectly-

1493
01:48:30,100 --> 01:48:31,100
Oh, wow.

1494
01:48:31,100 --> 01:48:32,100
You're in a perfect condition right now.

1495
01:48:32,100 --> 01:48:34,100
But this was a great mistake.

1496
01:48:34,100 --> 01:48:36,100
Wow. Holy cow, that's crazy.

1497
01:48:36,100 --> 01:48:40,100
I mean, I don't know how you- I just don't see what you just did. That's really crazy.

1498
01:48:40,100 --> 01:48:41,100
What did I do?

1499
01:48:41,100 --> 01:48:43,100
We have to end it now. Like, really.

1500
01:48:43,100 --> 01:48:45,100
What did I do?

1501
01:48:45,100 --> 01:48:47,100
I'm gonna stop for real. Really.

1502
01:48:47,100 --> 01:48:49,100
Okay.

1503
01:48:49,100 --> 01:48:51,100
Please. Please.

1504
01:48:53,100 --> 01:48:55,100
Trisha, let me just say, I'm sorry.

1505
01:48:55,100 --> 01:48:57,100
The fact, Ethan, that you just did that, you're right.

1506
01:48:57,100 --> 01:48:59,100
You're right. Nothing's wrong with you.

1507
01:48:59,100 --> 01:49:01,100
That's- but I go- you don't know how much therapy I go to a week.

1508
01:49:01,100 --> 01:49:03,100
I go to four Zoom sessions a week.

1509
01:49:03,100 --> 01:49:05,100
I understand, but-

1510
01:49:05,100 --> 01:49:07,100
Ethan, what you just said was, you're right, Trisha.

1511
01:49:07,100 --> 01:49:09,100
Everything's fine. That's insane.

1512
01:49:09,100 --> 01:49:11,100
The fact that you did that to me is like-

1513
01:49:16,100 --> 01:49:19,100
This is one of the problems with the rollover strategy.

1514
01:49:19,100 --> 01:49:21,100
Sometimes it's completely the wrong thing to do.

1515
01:49:21,100 --> 01:49:25,100
In this case, Trisha is expressing a doubt, a product of paranoid thinking.

1516
01:49:25,100 --> 01:49:28,100
There is no doubt in my mind that Ethan was not trying to gaslight them.

1517
01:49:28,100 --> 01:49:30,100
He just wanted clarity on how they are feeling.

1518
01:49:30,100 --> 01:49:32,100
But Trisha continued to push that theory,

1519
01:49:32,100 --> 01:49:36,100
and in the hopes that admitting it would make it die down, Ethan does just that.

1520
01:49:36,100 --> 01:49:38,100
The problem is that Trisha doesn't want that.

1521
01:49:38,100 --> 01:49:41,100
They didn't want to be right in that case, because what they were expressing is something that

1522
01:49:41,100 --> 01:49:45,100
represents their worst fears, that Ethan is just taking advantage of them and reaping the rewards,

1523
01:49:45,100 --> 01:49:48,100
and psychologically deceiving them whenever they bring it up.

1524
01:49:48,100 --> 01:49:52,100
In this case, their thoughts were that by framing their behaviour as angry or frustrated,

1525
01:49:52,100 --> 01:49:56,100
Ethan was trying to use their emotional response to discredit their legitimate criticism.

1526
01:49:56,100 --> 01:49:59,100
Although in a difficult spot, Ethan should have stood his ground,

1527
01:49:59,100 --> 01:50:03,100
explained his perception, and tried to calm the situation through a rational de-escalation.

1528
01:50:03,100 --> 01:50:07,100
But he did seem tired, and his concession, despite perhaps being a mistake,

1529
01:50:07,100 --> 01:50:12,100
may have been a reflection of his own mental exhaustion of trying to upkeep a podcast that was taking its toll.

1530
01:50:12,100 --> 01:50:17,100
With that said, given his sponsor segment, he clearly expected this to be resolved by the next episode.

1531
01:50:17,100 --> 01:50:21,100
After all, we had seen Trisha evolve a lot as a person in her time on the podcast.

1532
01:50:21,100 --> 01:50:24,100
Alas, this appeared to actually be the podcast's final episode,

1533
01:50:24,100 --> 01:50:29,100
as the following morning Trisha announced that they were stepping down from Frenemies indefinitely.

1534
01:50:29,100 --> 01:50:34,100
Trisha- I get it, I get now he's saying that H3O produces, and he deserves that as a producer,

1535
01:50:34,100 --> 01:50:39,100
but it's like I would have loved the opportunity to pitch in half for the set to, you know,

1536
01:50:39,100 --> 01:50:43,100
because I really do feel like I built this show like with them, like at 50-50,

1537
01:50:43,100 --> 01:50:46,100
like I don't think I'm the main reason because God knows my channel

1538
01:50:46,100 --> 01:50:50,100
and my podcast doesn't do like what Frenemies does, you know what I mean?

1539
01:50:50,100 --> 01:50:55,100
But at the same time, like H3O, it wasn't doing what it's doing now either.

1540
01:50:55,100 --> 01:50:59,100
I feel like I helped build that, like I thought Frenemies, we were building together,

1541
01:50:59,100 --> 01:51:04,100
like from the beginning was like 5% goes to the, to help the crew,

1542
01:51:04,100 --> 01:51:07,100
and then the other goes to production class, so I thought we were like building something,

1543
01:51:07,100 --> 01:51:11,100
like building, it was going to be like a bigger set, bigger things, bigger vlogs,

1544
01:51:11,100 --> 01:51:15,100
but it's just like, if I knew I was coming in as a third H3O show,

1545
01:51:15,100 --> 01:51:19,100
like I swear hand to God would not have done it.

1546
01:51:19,100 --> 01:51:23,100
And then yesterday just, you know, hearing that like, you know, he's the producer

1547
01:51:23,100 --> 01:51:26,100
and he does everything when I just, I really tried hard to contribute

1548
01:51:26,100 --> 01:51:30,100
and I really tried hard to like bring my own stuff every week and I feel like I did,

1549
01:51:30,100 --> 01:51:35,100
I feel like I had topics and stuff and it's just like, it hurt me.

1550
01:51:35,100 --> 01:51:38,100
As a video, it is extremely incoherent, but it's not hostile.

1551
01:51:38,100 --> 01:51:41,100
Trisha expressed great regret over the decision they're taking

1552
01:51:41,100 --> 01:51:46,100
and vents many of the frustrations that seem to be creeping up on them in the final podcast episodes.

1553
01:51:46,100 --> 01:51:49,100
They felt that Frenemies had become such an independent force of content

1554
01:51:49,100 --> 01:51:52,100
that they deserved a balanced input, something they didn't have.

1555
01:51:53,100 --> 01:51:57,100
They in hindsight admit that they were frustrated, but didn't feel like they were in that moment,

1556
01:51:57,100 --> 01:51:59,100
and obviously didn't respond well to Ethan's comments.

1557
01:51:59,100 --> 01:52:04,100
They've also felt generally uncomfortable with the crew, and certain incidents have certainly underlined that.

1558
01:52:04,100 --> 01:52:09,100
With the knowledge that this feeling is mutual, they don't want to return to that environment with anyone walking on eggshells.

1559
01:52:09,100 --> 01:52:13,100
Although they stand by their gripes, they're clearly upset with how they handled it,

1560
01:52:13,100 --> 01:52:18,100
and they wish it hadn't ended like that, and they hope they can remain firm friends with Ethan and Hila.

1561
01:52:19,100 --> 01:52:25,100
I will say for the record, Ethan and Hila have been so freaking kind to me.

1562
01:52:25,100 --> 01:52:30,100
And I hope it doesn't affect our personal relationship.

1563
01:52:30,100 --> 01:52:37,100
Because obviously, they are, like, gotta be family.

1564
01:52:37,100 --> 01:52:40,100
I really love them.

1565
01:52:40,100 --> 01:52:44,100
But at the same time, I always say, don't work with family, don't work with people you're close with.

1566
01:52:44,100 --> 01:52:47,100
I kind of feel that, you know, right?

1567
01:52:47,100 --> 01:52:52,100
As a video, I can understand why some may have issues with its presentation and maybe its message too,

1568
01:52:52,100 --> 01:52:56,100
but I honestly think that maybe stepping down was the best thing to do here,

1569
01:52:56,100 --> 01:52:59,100
and Ethan seemed to reluctantly yet graciously accept their resignation,

1570
01:52:59,100 --> 01:53:02,100
putting out a couple tweets on the matter which expressed disappointment,

1571
01:53:02,100 --> 01:53:05,100
yet acceptance, stating that he had done all he could.

1572
01:53:05,100 --> 01:53:07,100
Anyway, it was a bittersweet moment.

1573
01:53:07,100 --> 01:53:10,100
With this in mind, we could finally bring the Frenemy saga to a close.

1574
01:53:10,100 --> 01:53:15,100
A nice, peaceful close where everyone remains friends and we can all move forward together.

1575
01:53:15,100 --> 01:53:19,100
This crazy yet flawed experiment was finally over.

1576
01:53:19,100 --> 01:53:22,100
May it rest in peace.

1577
01:53:22,100 --> 01:53:25,100
Yeah, right.

1578
01:53:25,100 --> 01:53:27,100
There ain't no rest for the wicker though,

1579
01:53:27,100 --> 01:53:32,100
and as quickly as it seemed the drama came to a peaceful conclusion, it reignited once again.

1580
01:53:32,100 --> 01:53:36,100
Ethan was clearly unhappy that Trisha announced publicly that they were stepping back from the podcast

1581
01:53:36,100 --> 01:53:38,100
before speaking to him, which I can understand,

1582
01:53:38,100 --> 01:53:40,100
and he reached out expressing his own frustrations.

1583
01:53:40,100 --> 01:53:44,100
Trisha responded to this by posting another video called One More Thing,

1584
01:53:44,100 --> 01:53:47,100
not the title of their new sad boy song, admittedly.

1585
01:53:47,100 --> 01:53:53,100
The H3 employees have nothing to do with Frenemies as far as our 5% salary.

1586
01:53:53,100 --> 01:53:55,100
The 5% thing.

1587
01:53:55,100 --> 01:53:59,100
Yes, Ethan gets an extra 5% from the main channel, but he also gets 100% of the highlights,

1588
01:53:59,100 --> 01:54:02,100
so technically 105%, and the highlights make a shit ton of money.

1589
01:54:02,100 --> 01:54:04,100
I add up the views of our Frenemies highlights,

1590
01:54:04,100 --> 01:54:06,100
I'm not talking about the H3 highlights, I have our Frenemy highlights,

1591
01:54:06,100 --> 01:54:08,100
and that's like, it's literally probably half of what we make.

1592
01:54:08,100 --> 01:54:10,100
It's a lot, I would guess.

1593
01:54:11,100 --> 01:54:14,100
Anywhere from $50,000 to like $80,000 a month, that's just a guess.

1594
01:54:14,100 --> 01:54:16,100
I don't know, I don't see the numbers, I never do.

1595
01:54:16,100 --> 01:54:19,100
And I'm not asking for the crew to be fired, the crew have been so great to me,

1596
01:54:19,100 --> 01:54:22,100
I'm asking, and Ethan and I came to terms with it last night to have a producer,

1597
01:54:22,100 --> 01:54:25,100
even if they had a new hire, I would love my sister.

1598
01:54:25,100 --> 01:54:29,100
There's a couple couples working on a show or whatever,

1599
01:54:29,100 --> 01:54:32,100
or people related to each other, the 5%, and talking about their salary,

1600
01:54:32,100 --> 01:54:35,100
and the crew only gets 5%, I have no idea what the group gets paid,

1601
01:54:35,100 --> 01:54:38,100
I lashed out that I didn't like the ideas, and I lashed out on Ethan,

1602
01:54:39,100 --> 01:54:41,100
because Ethan is the one that presents me the ideas.

1603
01:54:41,100 --> 01:54:44,100
I don't know how it works with them, I don't know who comes up with it,

1604
01:54:44,100 --> 01:54:47,100
I don't know how they brainstorm, I don't know any of that,

1605
01:54:47,100 --> 01:54:49,100
because I'm not included in any of that.

1606
01:54:49,100 --> 01:54:52,100
The video is meant to be a clarification on the money matter,

1607
01:54:52,100 --> 01:54:54,100
though once again, Trisha goes off on various tangents,

1608
01:54:54,100 --> 01:54:57,100
and it seems mostly unexceptional as Trisha videos go,

1609
01:54:57,100 --> 01:55:00,100
certainly a departure from the angry Trisha that we had seen before.

1610
01:55:00,100 --> 01:55:03,100
Ethan, however, feeling that Trisha's responses were quite unsporting,

1611
01:55:03,100 --> 01:55:07,100
tweeted his frustration, claiming that the video was causing undue hate towards the crew.

1612
01:55:07,100 --> 01:55:10,100
Now, as a video, it's more defensive than aggressive,

1613
01:55:10,100 --> 01:55:12,100
and I would be surprised if it changed that much,

1614
01:55:12,100 --> 01:55:14,100
but once again, that was their experience.

1615
01:55:14,100 --> 01:55:17,100
Trisha, however, obviously felt hard done by because they believed

1616
01:55:17,100 --> 01:55:20,100
that Ethan was using the crew as a shield to try and attack their voice.

1617
01:55:20,100 --> 01:55:23,100
I can understand why this may have bothered them in the moment,

1618
01:55:23,100 --> 01:55:27,100
but the best thing they could do in that case was to make sure they didn't prove Ethan's point.

1619
01:55:27,100 --> 01:55:31,100
We all know that when Trisha feels Ethan isn't being just, it will spiral,

1620
01:55:31,100 --> 01:55:34,100
and from here there were a series of tweets by both parties,

1621
01:55:34,100 --> 01:55:36,100
mostly Trisha, arguing their case.

1622
01:55:36,100 --> 01:55:39,100
Many people were urging Trisha in particular to take a step back,

1623
01:55:39,100 --> 01:55:41,100
especially after DMs began to be published,

1624
01:55:41,100 --> 01:55:45,100
which actually ended backfiring when people pointed out Trisha's curious use of certain terms.

1625
01:55:45,100 --> 01:55:48,100
In this case, both sides seemed to relent momentarily,

1626
01:55:48,100 --> 01:55:51,100
with H3 stating that he needs to take a step back on the night

1627
01:55:51,100 --> 01:55:53,100
and expressing regret over his tweets,

1628
01:55:53,100 --> 01:55:55,100
and Trisha doing the same the following morning.

1629
01:55:55,100 --> 01:55:57,100
Many wanted them to hash this out in private,

1630
01:55:57,100 --> 01:56:00,100
and with both sides seeming to warp back their conduct a little,

1631
01:56:00,100 --> 01:56:02,100
it was thought that maybe this would be the opportunity.

1632
01:56:03,100 --> 01:56:07,100
The problem is that I think Trisha did legitimately feel like they were being treated poorly,

1633
01:56:07,100 --> 01:56:11,100
and when they're trapped in an environment with someone who they feel is acting without the best intentions,

1634
01:56:11,100 --> 01:56:14,100
they don't want to combine themselves to that space.

1635
01:56:14,100 --> 01:56:17,100
Yet, instead of consulting a friend or a reliable third party,

1636
01:56:17,100 --> 01:56:20,100
they decide to make the internet their trusted confidant,

1637
01:56:20,100 --> 01:56:22,100
a generally bad decision, not just for yourself,

1638
01:56:22,100 --> 01:56:27,100
but for the other person who feels that you're betraying their trust by taking it to such a public platform.

1639
01:56:27,100 --> 01:56:31,100
Social media for Trisha was event space, and not one that was very healthy.

1640
01:56:31,100 --> 01:56:55,100
The following morning, though, Trisha posted a video titled I'm Sorry,

1641
01:56:55,100 --> 01:56:57,100
where they channel those regretful sentiments,

1642
01:56:57,100 --> 01:57:00,100
they apologise a lot and believe it was a misunderstanding,

1643
01:57:00,100 --> 01:57:05,100
and insist they don't want to be viewed as that hateful monster that they may have appeared as the day before.

1644
01:57:05,100 --> 01:57:08,100
This is something that they genuinely felt bad about.

1645
01:57:08,100 --> 01:57:13,100
With both sides back to a more sympathetic stance after a brief moment where emotions overflowed,

1646
01:57:13,100 --> 01:57:16,100
it seemed that maybe both parties could find closure on this matter.

1647
01:57:16,100 --> 01:57:19,100
This was the conclusion that we needed.

1648
01:57:19,100 --> 01:57:22,100
However, it was not the conclusion that we deserved.

1649
01:57:22,100 --> 01:57:24,100
Why did we forsake God?

1650
01:57:24,100 --> 01:57:26,100
Hello everybody.

1651
01:57:26,100 --> 01:57:30,100
Not a typical episode, obviously.

1652
01:57:35,100 --> 01:57:41,100
Now, for many, episode 39 is technically regarded as the last episode of Frenemies.

1653
01:57:41,100 --> 01:57:44,100
However, there is one more video in the Frenemies playlist,

1654
01:57:44,100 --> 01:57:47,100
a video uploaded on the 10th of June 2021,

1655
01:57:47,100 --> 01:57:49,100
two days after Trisha officially quit,

1656
01:57:49,100 --> 01:57:52,100
by then addressing much of the drama that had been occurring.

1657
01:57:52,100 --> 01:57:55,100
He comes into this video with the intent of correcting the record,

1658
01:57:55,100 --> 01:57:58,100
given that Trisha had been making a variety of public statements.

1659
01:57:58,100 --> 01:58:01,100
Ethan seemed to be approaching this with the signature peace and love,

1660
01:58:01,100 --> 01:58:03,100
and not wishing to burn any bridges.

1661
01:58:03,100 --> 01:58:08,100
So I say with peace and love that, you know, as a friend,

1662
01:58:08,100 --> 01:58:13,100
I have come to love and appreciate Trisha.

1663
01:58:13,100 --> 01:58:19,100
You know, as a partner, I think she's one of the funniest people I've ever known,

1664
01:58:20,100 --> 01:58:24,100
you know, one of the most dynamic and entertaining people I've ever known.

1665
01:58:24,100 --> 01:58:27,100
She puts me in these tough situations where it's like,

1666
01:58:27,100 --> 01:58:29,100
I'm losing no matter what.

1667
01:58:29,100 --> 01:58:34,100
She can say whatever she wants, you know, what she puts out publicly,

1668
01:58:34,100 --> 01:58:38,100
and then, you know, if I just sit and take it, everything's distorted.

1669
01:58:38,100 --> 01:58:43,100
And if I say anything, then I'm the bad guy for, you know,

1670
01:58:43,100 --> 01:58:46,100
coming after something, which is not my intention at all.

1671
01:58:46,100 --> 01:58:48,100
This, just for the record, is not.

1672
01:58:48,100 --> 01:58:51,100
The video seems to seek to clarify certain points that were made,

1673
01:58:51,100 --> 01:58:52,100
first being the employment one.

1674
01:58:52,100 --> 01:58:56,100
Ethan states that they actually discussed this after the argument on episode 39,

1675
01:58:56,100 --> 01:59:01,100
and Ethan had agreed to let Trisha bring on a producer to try and ease Trisha's discomfort with the current arrangements.

1676
01:59:01,100 --> 01:59:06,100
So the day after we shot, after we had like broken up,

1677
01:59:06,100 --> 01:59:13,100
we had a conversation for the first time ever about her wanting to hire new staff

1678
01:59:13,100 --> 01:59:16,100
that she would look for and hire to work on Frenemies.

1679
01:59:16,100 --> 01:59:19,100
That was the first time we had ever discussed that.

1680
01:59:19,100 --> 01:59:22,100
And after talking it out with her, I agreed.

1681
01:59:22,100 --> 01:59:24,100
I said, okay, we can, you know what?

1682
01:59:24,100 --> 01:59:28,100
Again, because I just want to make everything smooth and manageable.

1683
01:59:28,100 --> 01:59:31,100
We had this big blowout. We talked the evening afterwards.

1684
01:59:31,100 --> 01:59:33,100
I said, you know what? Let's hire a producer.

1685
01:59:33,100 --> 01:59:36,100
You tell me who you want to hire, and I'll hire him.

1686
01:59:36,100 --> 01:59:40,100
His only stipulation was that the situation would be left to settle for a few days.

1687
01:59:40,100 --> 01:59:43,100
However, the following day, he was blindsided by Trisha's video,

1688
01:59:43,100 --> 01:59:46,100
which in his opinion undermined the agreements previously made

1689
01:59:46,100 --> 01:59:48,100
and framed the situation uncharitably,

1690
01:59:48,100 --> 01:59:53,100
especially given what Trisha had asked for initially was rather unreasonable and disrespectful in his mind.

1691
01:59:53,100 --> 01:59:56,100
I don't know, from a business partner perspective and a friend perspective,

1692
01:59:56,100 --> 01:59:58,100
that video really rubbed me the wrong way,

1693
01:59:58,100 --> 02:00:04,100
because I woke up after having a conversation with her where I agreed that everything she wanted to do,

1694
02:00:06,100 --> 02:00:12,100
and I wake up to her being like saying all this stuff about private conversations we had,

1695
02:00:12,100 --> 02:00:19,100
and saying, oh, it's the crew's fault, people on the crew were unhappy, you know?

1696
02:00:19,100 --> 02:00:26,100
And like, I don't know, I just felt like that video was just so unnecessary,

1697
02:00:26,100 --> 02:00:32,100
and I just didn't get it, because I had done everything possible.

1698
02:00:32,100 --> 02:00:36,100
He also clears up some misconceptions as to why the crew were reluctant to shoot the day after,

1699
02:00:36,100 --> 02:00:38,100
citing that it wasn't due to Trisha's behaviour on set,

1700
02:00:38,100 --> 02:00:41,100
but actually him feeding comments back to them about Trisha's requests,

1701
02:00:41,100 --> 02:00:43,100
which he concedes was his fault,

1702
02:00:43,100 --> 02:00:47,100
or with him taking the final decision to not shoot despite the crew's openness to do so.

1703
02:00:47,100 --> 02:00:51,100
She told me that she wanted a whole new crew for Frenemies,

1704
02:00:51,100 --> 02:00:53,100
because she didn't feel comfortable with them,

1705
02:00:55,100 --> 02:00:56,100
she wanted a whole new space,

1706
02:00:57,100 --> 02:00:58,100
she wanted a whole new crew,

1707
02:01:02,100 --> 02:01:03,100
and it just...

1708
02:01:06,100 --> 02:01:08,100
I don't know, it's like she couldn't meet me halfway.

1709
02:01:08,100 --> 02:01:14,100
A whole new crew, we need to essentially fire everybody that's worked on this show from the beginning,

1710
02:01:14,100 --> 02:01:18,100
find a new space, and change everything.

1711
02:01:18,100 --> 02:01:21,100
This is where maybe I fucked up, okay?

1712
02:01:21,100 --> 02:01:25,100
Is that I was talking to the crew, like, Trisha wants to,

1713
02:01:25,100 --> 02:01:29,100
I was like, listen, Trisha wants to hire a new crew.

1714
02:01:29,100 --> 02:01:32,100
When the crew found out she wanted to fire them all,

1715
02:01:32,100 --> 02:01:38,100
they were, first of all, they've always been down to go work and do the shoot as we scheduled.

1716
02:01:38,100 --> 02:01:45,100
They are good, loyal, you know, hardworking employees that are down to get the job done no matter what.

1717
02:01:45,100 --> 02:01:50,100
I had done a temperature check, like, how do you guys feel about going to do this?

1718
02:01:50,100 --> 02:01:54,100
Because there was some, there was just people like, you know,

1719
02:01:54,100 --> 02:01:58,100
the vibe was like, Trisha wants to fire you guys and hire new people to do Frenemies.

1720
02:01:58,100 --> 02:02:01,100
And also, do you want to go meet with her and shoot tomorrow?

1721
02:02:01,100 --> 02:02:06,100
And so obviously, they were like, well, it's a little awkward, right?

1722
02:02:06,100 --> 02:02:09,100
But, of course, I'm willing to do it.

1723
02:02:09,100 --> 02:02:15,100
So I made the executive decision as their boss, trying to foster a healthy work environment,

1724
02:02:15,100 --> 02:02:19,100
that let's just not do the shoot tomorrow, bearing everything that's happened,

1725
02:02:19,100 --> 02:02:22,100
and take a few days to chill off.

1726
02:02:22,100 --> 02:02:26,100
He states that Trisha's comments about certain things alongside DMs that were leaked

1727
02:02:26,100 --> 02:02:29,100
had caused people to go out of their way to harass individuals who had not done anything wrong.

1728
02:02:30,100 --> 02:02:32,100
He expresses solidarity for the people he works with,

1729
02:02:32,100 --> 02:02:36,100
and reaffirms the stance that Trisha's behaviour was unprofessional in his eyes.

1730
02:02:36,100 --> 02:02:38,100
I don't think it really matters whose idea it was.

1731
02:02:38,100 --> 02:02:43,100
The fact that Trisha was just going to sit there and trash their work was kind of unacceptable to me,

1732
02:02:43,100 --> 02:02:47,100
because ultimately, I have to create a safe work environment for my employees.

1733
02:02:47,100 --> 02:02:50,100
And it's just kind of toxic to sit there and shit on their work.

1734
02:02:50,100 --> 02:02:52,100
Whoever did it, it doesn't matter who did it.

1735
02:02:52,100 --> 02:02:55,100
But the thing is, she keeps harping that in all of her videos to the point where

1736
02:02:55,100 --> 02:02:59,100
not only is Sam now getting shit on on her social medias,

1737
02:02:59,100 --> 02:03:01,100
people have gone out of their way and been like,

1738
02:03:01,100 --> 02:03:03,100
you're the reason Frenemies is over,

1739
02:03:03,100 --> 02:03:06,100
people are going to AB's wife,

1740
02:03:06,100 --> 02:03:08,100
people are going to Dan's girlfriend,

1741
02:03:08,100 --> 02:03:12,100
and just like random spit-firing shit at them

1742
02:03:12,100 --> 02:03:15,100
with the chance that that's the person Trisha was talking about.

1743
02:03:15,100 --> 02:03:18,100
And that's just, it's just not acceptable, you know.

1744
02:03:18,100 --> 02:03:22,100
And this was part of a private conversation that she made public to try to justify

1745
02:03:25,100 --> 02:03:26,100
why she wanted to leave the show.

1746
02:03:26,100 --> 02:03:28,100
The crew did nothing wrong.

1747
02:03:28,100 --> 02:03:30,100
I misunderstood the situation.

1748
02:03:30,100 --> 02:03:33,100
I told Trisha that people were upset,

1749
02:03:33,100 --> 02:03:35,100
that she didn't like this segment, okay?

1750
02:03:35,100 --> 02:03:36,100
I take the blame for that.

1751
02:03:36,100 --> 02:03:39,100
The reason they were upset that I misunderstood

1752
02:03:39,100 --> 02:03:42,100
is because she said she wanted to fire them all.

1753
02:03:42,100 --> 02:03:45,100
They were always willing to do their job, period.

1754
02:03:45,100 --> 02:03:47,100
They have done nothing wrong.

1755
02:03:47,100 --> 02:03:50,100
This is all fairly anecdotal, with his own perspective thrown in there.

1756
02:03:50,100 --> 02:03:51,100
However, the tone changes to the next part,

1757
02:03:51,100 --> 02:03:54,100
where he seems to address the inherent problem with how Frenemies have become.

1758
02:03:54,100 --> 02:03:57,100
This idea that Ethan had become a quote emotional punching bag,

1759
02:03:57,100 --> 02:04:00,100
and while he often had to show restraint in those moments,

1760
02:04:00,100 --> 02:04:01,100
Trisha had free reign,

1761
02:04:01,100 --> 02:04:03,100
a double standard in his mind that he lost patience for,

1762
02:04:03,100 --> 02:04:06,100
venting many of his own frustrations surrounding Trisha's behaviour,

1763
02:04:06,100 --> 02:04:08,100
including claims about their contributions,

1764
02:04:08,100 --> 02:04:10,100
their conduct while they were creating content,

1765
02:04:10,100 --> 02:04:12,100
and their nature to publicise drama.

1766
02:04:12,100 --> 02:04:14,100
She called my wife like the C-word.

1767
02:04:14,100 --> 02:04:17,100
She called me, you know, she said the most horrible thing.

1768
02:04:17,100 --> 02:04:18,100
She said I'm a terrible parent.

1769
02:04:18,100 --> 02:04:19,100
Hila's a terrible parent.

1770
02:04:19,100 --> 02:04:21,100
And for me, it's like, okay.

1771
02:04:21,100 --> 02:04:25,100
And I understand, again, that she has mental health,

1772
02:04:25,100 --> 02:04:27,100
she has mental, like, health issues,

1773
02:04:27,100 --> 02:04:30,100
but at the end of the day, it's just not,

1774
02:04:30,100 --> 02:04:33,100
I don't feel like it's fair.

1775
02:04:33,100 --> 02:04:35,100
Even though she has those issues, it's just,

1776
02:04:35,100 --> 02:04:38,100
I can't be her emotional punching bag,

1777
02:04:38,100 --> 02:04:41,100
and then the minute I speak up for myself,

1778
02:04:41,100 --> 02:04:44,100
it turns into another, like, show-ending fight.

1779
02:04:44,100 --> 02:04:46,100
It's just not a fair relationship.

1780
02:04:46,100 --> 02:04:50,100
I texted her, trying to be mature and handle it personally,

1781
02:04:50,100 --> 02:04:54,100
like, off the internet.

1782
02:04:54,100 --> 02:04:57,100
I said, you know, I just want to be honest with you

1783
02:04:57,100 --> 02:04:59,100
and say I felt it was really unfair

1784
02:04:59,100 --> 02:05:02,100
how you put that video out, you know,

1785
02:05:02,100 --> 02:05:05,100
after we worked to try to resolve this.

1786
02:05:05,100 --> 02:05:07,100
And she ignores my texts,

1787
02:05:07,100 --> 02:05:11,100
and she posts another 20-minute video 30 minutes later

1788
02:05:11,100 --> 02:05:15,100
that was in response to my texts that was more like,

1789
02:05:15,100 --> 02:05:17,100
oh, the crews, the reason why this happened,

1790
02:05:17,100 --> 02:05:19,100
and sending even more hate to their fucking Instagrams.

1791
02:05:19,100 --> 02:05:22,100
I don't have, I'm a patient man,

1792
02:05:22,100 --> 02:05:24,100
but I'm not, like, superhuman.

1793
02:05:24,100 --> 02:05:26,100
Another problem he communicates is Trisha's nature

1794
02:05:26,100 --> 02:05:28,100
to not actually confront their problems.

1795
02:05:28,100 --> 02:05:29,100
Now, we've known this for a while,

1796
02:05:29,100 --> 02:05:31,100
but in this case, he shows that Trisha did not indicate

1797
02:05:31,100 --> 02:05:32,100
there were any problems with ideas

1798
02:05:32,100 --> 02:05:34,100
that they had subsequently trashed on the podcast

1799
02:05:34,100 --> 02:05:36,100
and after the podcast,

1800
02:05:36,100 --> 02:05:38,100
including that of the costume and the segment.

1801
02:05:38,100 --> 02:05:40,100
And it's like, imagine how confusing it is,

1802
02:05:40,100 --> 02:05:44,100
because she goes on the show, and she says,

1803
02:05:44,100 --> 02:05:47,100
oh, this questions is so dumb.

1804
02:05:47,100 --> 02:05:49,100
It's lazy. It's crap. I hate it.

1805
02:05:49,100 --> 02:05:53,100
I mean, the day before, she retweeted it unprompted.

1806
02:05:53,100 --> 02:05:55,100
I did not even ask her.

1807
02:05:55,100 --> 02:06:01,100
That's just really, really difficult.

1808
02:06:01,100 --> 02:06:04,100
Like, how much she hated the costumes.

1809
02:06:04,100 --> 02:06:06,100
It was my idea. She never wanted to do it.

1810
02:06:06,100 --> 02:06:07,100
She doesn't even know the character.

1811
02:06:07,100 --> 02:06:10,100
She says, I never, I don't even know this character.

1812
02:06:10,100 --> 02:06:13,100
I sent her this picture. I said, costume idea?

1813
02:06:13,100 --> 02:06:15,100
She says, laugh my ass off.

1814
02:06:15,100 --> 02:06:16,100
Oh my God. Oh my God.

1815
02:06:16,100 --> 02:06:18,100
This is one of my all time favorite movies.

1816
02:06:18,100 --> 02:06:20,100
Can we? I love her.

1817
02:06:20,100 --> 02:06:22,100
I don't understand. What am I supposed to do?

1818
02:06:22,100 --> 02:06:24,100
That's what I mean.

1819
02:06:24,100 --> 02:06:26,100
It's like, I can't humanly do more.

1820
02:06:26,100 --> 02:06:28,100
She expects superhuman care.

1821
02:06:28,100 --> 02:06:30,100
He then continues to explain his justification

1822
02:06:30,100 --> 02:06:32,100
between the 5% gap between shares

1823
02:06:32,100 --> 02:06:33,100
and the profit from the podcast,

1824
02:06:33,100 --> 02:06:35,100
something that he clearly feels

1825
02:06:35,100 --> 02:06:37,100
he's been quite generous and transparent about.

1826
02:06:37,100 --> 02:06:39,100
He addresses the DMs that Trisha shared,

1827
02:06:39,100 --> 02:06:41,100
the investment he made on merchandise,

1828
02:06:41,100 --> 02:06:43,100
with an escalating tone of exasperation,

1829
02:06:43,100 --> 02:06:45,100
conveying the frustration at the investment he lost.

1830
02:06:45,100 --> 02:06:47,100
We pay for the set.

1831
02:06:47,100 --> 02:06:49,100
We rent the space. We film it.

1832
02:06:49,100 --> 02:06:51,100
We use our equipment. We employ the people.

1833
02:06:51,100 --> 02:06:53,100
We edit it. We upload it. We post it.

1834
02:06:53,100 --> 02:06:55,100
We get that. Sponsors.

1835
02:06:55,100 --> 02:06:57,100
We develop the concepts.

1836
02:06:57,100 --> 02:06:59,100
We work all week to prep the segments.

1837
02:06:59,100 --> 02:07:01,100
We pay for the insurance.

1838
02:07:01,100 --> 02:07:03,100
We do the accounting and the payroll.

1839
02:07:03,100 --> 02:07:05,100
I send her a fully itemized report every month

1840
02:07:05,100 --> 02:07:07,100
of literally everything

1841
02:07:07,100 --> 02:07:09,100
and how the expenses break down and her cut.

1842
02:07:09,100 --> 02:07:11,100
And the fact that she would even accuse

1843
02:07:11,100 --> 02:07:13,100
me of not being transparent is

1844
02:07:13,100 --> 02:07:15,100
honestly very hurtful

1845
02:07:15,100 --> 02:07:17,100
because I've gone so far out of my way

1846
02:07:17,100 --> 02:07:19,100
to be as transparent

1847
02:07:19,100 --> 02:07:21,100
as possible. I show her literally everything.

1848
02:07:21,100 --> 02:07:23,100
And then she starts going,

1849
02:07:23,100 --> 02:07:25,100
I want an itemized breakdown of how that

1850
02:07:25,100 --> 02:07:27,100
5% is spent. And I'm like, dude,

1851
02:07:27,100 --> 02:07:29,100
it's not like that. It's just

1852
02:07:29,100 --> 02:07:31,100
a feat. It's a production feat.

1853
02:07:31,100 --> 02:07:33,100
I'm not giving you an itemized deduction

1854
02:07:33,100 --> 02:07:35,100
of the entire business.

1855
02:07:35,100 --> 02:07:37,100
It's like

1856
02:07:37,100 --> 02:07:39,100
these absolutely unreasonable,

1857
02:07:39,100 --> 02:07:41,100
unimaginable bars

1858
02:07:41,100 --> 02:07:43,100
that I could never reach.

1859
02:07:43,100 --> 02:07:45,100
She posted a screenshot of herself calling me

1860
02:07:45,100 --> 02:07:47,100
Julie.

1861
02:07:47,100 --> 02:07:49,100
For wanting

1862
02:07:49,100 --> 02:07:51,100
5% to cover the

1863
02:07:51,100 --> 02:07:53,100
massiveness of this

1864
02:07:53,100 --> 02:07:55,100
production. We spent $30,000

1865
02:07:55,100 --> 02:07:57,100
buying all new equipment,

1866
02:07:57,100 --> 02:07:59,100
cameras, switching board,

1867
02:07:59,100 --> 02:08:01,100
audio equipment,

1868
02:08:01,100 --> 02:08:03,100
microphones, everything

1869
02:08:03,100 --> 02:08:05,100
so that we can continue to do it

1870
02:08:05,100 --> 02:08:07,100
at the house for her. And she keeps

1871
02:08:07,100 --> 02:08:09,100
bringing up this like, well, you get 5%.

1872
02:08:09,100 --> 02:08:11,100
So you should be like, what is that for? You need to be

1873
02:08:11,100 --> 02:08:13,100
paying. And I say, okay, you know what?

1874
02:08:13,100 --> 02:08:15,100
Let's keep the show going. Let's do it

1875
02:08:15,100 --> 02:08:17,100
at the house. I'm going to spend another

1876
02:08:17,100 --> 02:08:19,100
$30,000 on the already

1877
02:08:19,100 --> 02:08:21,100
$50,000 I spent on the set.

1878
02:08:21,100 --> 02:08:23,100
Circles, we are splitting the 30%,

1879
02:08:23,100 --> 02:08:25,100
which is typically our profit margin. It's like

1880
02:08:25,100 --> 02:08:27,100
Trisha, just read what I wrote

1881
02:08:27,100 --> 02:08:29,100
to you. The profit margin

1882
02:08:29,100 --> 02:08:31,100
is 30%. I'm giving you

1883
02:08:31,100 --> 02:08:33,100
half of the profits.

1884
02:08:33,100 --> 02:08:35,100
Do you want 50% of all the

1885
02:08:35,100 --> 02:08:37,100
revenue? Because I will lose money again.

1886
02:08:37,100 --> 02:08:39,100
Apparently, you're the only one that's allowed to

1887
02:08:39,100 --> 02:08:41,100
make money in this relationship.

1888
02:08:41,100 --> 02:08:43,100
I really don't understand. Although he came into

1889
02:08:43,100 --> 02:08:45,100
the video with peace and love, it kind of felt that

1890
02:08:45,100 --> 02:08:47,100
mood waned after the first 20 minutes.

1891
02:08:47,100 --> 02:08:49,100
If everything he's saying is true, then it's

1892
02:08:49,100 --> 02:08:51,100
not hard to understand why he feels the way

1893
02:08:51,100 --> 02:08:53,100
he does. But given what we know, it was not

1894
02:08:53,100 --> 02:08:55,100
going to temper the situation. Every penny

1895
02:08:55,100 --> 02:08:57,100
I've made from Frenemies, by the way, if she wants

1896
02:08:57,100 --> 02:08:59,100
to talk about money, is tied up in this

1897
02:08:59,100 --> 02:09:01,100
merch that doesn't come out for another month.

1898
02:09:01,100 --> 02:09:03,100
I don't even know if we're going to

1899
02:09:03,100 --> 02:09:05,100
sell. So it's like for all the complaining she

1900
02:09:05,100 --> 02:09:07,100
does for money, she's the only one, as far as

1901
02:09:07,100 --> 02:09:09,100
I'm concerned, that's actually making money from this thing.

1902
02:09:09,100 --> 02:09:11,100
Because I've spent pretty much every fucking penny

1903
02:09:11,100 --> 02:09:13,100
I've made from Frenemies into the show,

1904
02:09:13,100 --> 02:09:15,100
on merch, into the own resources,

1905
02:09:15,100 --> 02:09:17,100
buying more equipment for the fucking studio,

1906
02:09:17,100 --> 02:09:19,100
building the set. It's like

1907
02:09:19,100 --> 02:09:21,100
it's so easy for her to complain. She

1908
02:09:21,100 --> 02:09:23,100
shows up, she gets a guaranteed check

1909
02:09:23,100 --> 02:09:25,100
every fucking month,

1910
02:09:25,100 --> 02:09:27,100
and I'm putting all

1911
02:09:27,100 --> 02:09:29,100
my money on the line. And now, I have

1912
02:09:29,100 --> 02:09:31,100
hundreds of thousands of dollars tied up in merch

1913
02:09:31,100 --> 02:09:33,100
and I'm probably not going to be able to fucking sell,

1914
02:09:33,100 --> 02:09:35,100
that my wife works super hard on,

1915
02:09:35,100 --> 02:09:37,100
her staff works super hard on, and now it's like

1916
02:09:37,100 --> 02:09:39,100
tough luck, dude. Trisha got paid

1917
02:09:39,100 --> 02:09:41,100
and she's complaining about 5%. It blows

1918
02:09:41,100 --> 02:09:43,100
my mind, and I'm upset about it.

1919
02:09:43,100 --> 02:09:45,100
I am. I can't hide it. I just am.

1920
02:09:45,100 --> 02:09:47,100
It's just not fair. 5%, when I'm

1921
02:09:47,100 --> 02:09:49,100
literally not making a fucking penny

1922
02:09:49,100 --> 02:09:51,100
at this point,

1923
02:09:51,100 --> 02:09:53,100
it's just, it's just, it's just

1924
02:09:53,100 --> 02:09:55,100
so disrespectful. It disregards

1925
02:09:55,100 --> 02:09:57,100
all the hard work we do, not only

1926
02:09:57,100 --> 02:09:59,100
on the crew, but now on my wife, and all the

1927
02:09:59,100 --> 02:10:01,100
people that worked on the merch.

1928
02:10:01,100 --> 02:10:03,100
It's like, okay, well, you know, fuck you.

1929
02:10:03,100 --> 02:10:05,100
In a way, his own confusion may appear

1930
02:10:05,100 --> 02:10:07,100
contradictory, because on the one hand,

1931
02:10:07,100 --> 02:10:09,100
he expresses the fact that he did not want to overhaul

1932
02:10:09,100 --> 02:10:11,100
the structure of the show to cater to Trisha's needs

1933
02:10:11,100 --> 02:10:13,100
with the possibility that they could quit any minute.

1934
02:10:13,100 --> 02:10:15,100
At the same time, he is still frustrated

1935
02:10:15,100 --> 02:10:17,100
that he has lost all these investments, particularly

1936
02:10:17,100 --> 02:10:19,100
on the merchandise front. I think it fundamentally

1937
02:10:19,100 --> 02:10:21,100
comes down to trust. Although

1938
02:10:21,100 --> 02:10:23,100
Ethan's vexation is to be expected,

1939
02:10:23,100 --> 02:10:25,100
it was clear that he had still expected this to

1940
02:10:25,100 --> 02:10:27,100
happen inevitably. He was the producer

1941
02:10:27,100 --> 02:10:29,100
and the owner, and when you're in that position, you have

1942
02:10:29,100 --> 02:10:31,100
to be prepared for someone to walk out on a project,

1943
02:10:31,100 --> 02:10:33,100
and Ethan certainly expected as much.

1944
02:10:33,100 --> 02:10:35,100
With this in mind, ending the podcast was

1945
02:10:35,100 --> 02:10:37,100
probably for the best, and although visibly frustrated,

1946
02:10:37,100 --> 02:10:39,100
he shows resolve in his final decision.

1947
02:10:39,100 --> 02:10:41,100
I mean, we've gone out of our way

1948
02:10:41,100 --> 02:10:43,100
in every imaginable way

1949
02:10:43,100 --> 02:10:45,100
to make her feel welcome, accommodated, listened

1950
02:10:45,100 --> 02:10:47,100
to, appreciated to, and

1951
02:10:47,100 --> 02:10:49,100
the truth is

1952
02:10:49,100 --> 02:10:51,100
that I'm very grateful for

1953
02:10:51,100 --> 02:10:53,100
the experience we've had with Frenemies,

1954
02:10:53,100 --> 02:10:55,100
and all the learning, and growing, and

1955
02:10:55,100 --> 02:10:57,100
helping, and the amazing growth

1956
02:10:57,100 --> 02:10:59,100
that our channel has seen as the result

1957
02:10:59,100 --> 02:11:01,100
of that show. I mean, it's been

1958
02:11:01,100 --> 02:11:03,100
popular and successful

1959
02:11:03,100 --> 02:11:05,100
beyond what either of us anticipated.

1960
02:11:05,100 --> 02:11:07,100
And I have so much

1961
02:11:07,100 --> 02:11:09,100
to thank Trisha for.

1962
02:11:09,100 --> 02:11:11,100
It is with a heavy heart, you know,

1963
02:11:11,100 --> 02:11:13,100
that we end the show, and

1964
02:11:15,100 --> 02:11:17,100
it sucks.

1965
02:11:17,100 --> 02:11:19,100
It does suck, but

1966
02:11:19,100 --> 02:11:21,100
you know what?

1967
02:11:21,100 --> 02:11:23,100
Life goes on,

1968
02:11:23,100 --> 02:11:25,100
right? We're not stopping,

1969
02:11:25,100 --> 02:11:27,100
we're only getting started, and

1970
02:11:27,100 --> 02:11:29,100
I'm sure that Trisha's got

1971
02:11:29,100 --> 02:11:31,100
a lot of good stuff up her sleeve

1972
02:11:31,100 --> 02:11:33,100
for you guys as well, so.

1973
02:11:33,100 --> 02:11:35,100
However, Ethan's video did not sit well with Trisha,

1974
02:11:35,100 --> 02:11:37,100
and maybe they felt offended by his expectations,

1975
02:11:37,100 --> 02:11:39,100
maybe they didn't like the framing, but as always

1976
02:11:39,100 --> 02:11:41,100
they responded, and what we received was

1977
02:11:41,100 --> 02:11:43,100
a lot of content, but not a lot of substance.

1978
02:11:43,100 --> 02:11:45,100
I'll add a little note here that when

1979
02:11:45,100 --> 02:11:47,100
working on research, I was disappointed

1980
02:11:47,100 --> 02:11:49,100
at reading a part one, as that meant

1981
02:11:49,100 --> 02:11:51,100
there would be a part two. What I didn't account

1982
02:11:51,100 --> 02:11:53,100
for was the part three, leaving

1983
02:11:53,100 --> 02:11:55,100
these response videos at two hours and fifteen

1984
02:11:55,100 --> 02:11:57,100
minutes in total.

1985
02:12:13,100 --> 02:12:15,100
It's a clip and response style video where essentially

1986
02:12:15,100 --> 02:12:17,100
Trisha replies to Ethan's points as he makes them in

1987
02:12:17,100 --> 02:12:19,100
the video, but responding to the clips as they

1988
02:12:19,100 --> 02:12:21,100
happen wasn't a good idea, because you need

1989
02:12:21,100 --> 02:12:23,100
to know what points Ethan is at least going

1990
02:12:23,100 --> 02:12:25,100
to make before you make your own points.

1991
02:12:25,100 --> 02:12:27,100
Case in points?

1992
02:12:41,100 --> 02:12:43,100
Here Trisha reasserts the idea that it's the crew that refused

1993
02:12:43,100 --> 02:12:45,100
to film. Now with the DMs, we can see why

1994
02:12:45,100 --> 02:12:47,100
Trisha may have received this impression. With the

1995
02:12:47,100 --> 02:12:49,100
context that Ethan has provided, we now know

1996
02:12:49,100 --> 02:12:51,100
that that's not the case, and he doesn't explicitly

1997
02:12:51,100 --> 02:12:53,100
say that the crew was what was stopping them

1998
02:12:53,100 --> 02:12:55,100
from filming, more that he thinks they shouldn't

1999
02:12:55,100 --> 02:12:57,100
film given the situation with the crew.

2000
02:12:57,100 --> 02:12:59,100
It's a misunderstanding, they happen,

2001
02:12:59,100 --> 02:13:01,100
but there's no need to perpetuate it when it's

2002
02:13:01,100 --> 02:13:03,100
cleared up, but these misunderstandings

2003
02:13:03,100 --> 02:13:05,100
only go further unfortunately.

2004
02:13:17,100 --> 02:13:45,100
I'm not going to dissect these videos the way I dissected Ethan's video, mainly because Trisha makes a lot of points they'd already made on other platforms, however I will try to give a brief outline.

2005
02:13:47,100 --> 02:14:07,100
I think Trisha's video ultimately comes

2006
02:14:07,100 --> 02:14:09,100
down to them wanting to step back because they

2007
02:14:09,100 --> 02:14:11,100
fundamentally don't understand what they did

2008
02:14:11,100 --> 02:14:13,100
wrong, and therefore unless they can come to some

2009
02:14:13,100 --> 02:14:15,100
personal reconciliation, they can't compromise

2010
02:14:15,100 --> 02:14:17,100
on the belief that they didn't act out of line.

2011
02:14:17,100 --> 02:14:19,100
They don't think they're demanding, they don't think

2012
02:14:19,100 --> 02:14:21,100
they're unreasonable, they're not trying to force

2013
02:14:21,100 --> 02:14:23,100
people to walk on eggshells.

2014
02:14:23,100 --> 02:14:25,100
But again, this kind of thing, I have to walk

2015
02:14:25,100 --> 02:14:27,100
on eggshells with you, I have to keep you happy,

2016
02:14:27,100 --> 02:14:29,100
that's not another reason I don't

2017
02:14:29,100 --> 02:14:31,100
want to be there, I don't want that work environment,

2018
02:14:31,100 --> 02:14:33,100
I'm trying to keep you happy, because I don't think

2019
02:14:33,100 --> 02:14:35,100
I make that many demands.

2020
02:14:35,100 --> 02:14:37,100
We don't, anything

2021
02:14:37,100 --> 02:14:39,100
anything they've ever talked to me about

2022
02:14:39,100 --> 02:14:41,100
I'm just like, yes, yes, yes.

2023
02:14:41,100 --> 02:14:43,100
It's grown so

2024
02:14:43,100 --> 02:14:45,100
much, and I'm obviously

2025
02:14:45,100 --> 02:14:47,100
appreciative of everything he

2026
02:14:47,100 --> 02:14:49,100
put in to start, but

2027
02:14:49,100 --> 02:14:51,100
now that that's obviously

2028
02:14:51,100 --> 02:14:53,100
recouped times a hundred, it's like, can we

2029
02:14:53,100 --> 02:14:55,100
use some of it, like I get that you're still the

2030
02:14:55,100 --> 02:14:57,100
producer, or whatever,

2031
02:14:57,100 --> 02:14:59,100
but like can we use some of it towards

2032
02:14:59,100 --> 02:15:01,100
you know, building

2033
02:15:01,100 --> 02:15:03,100
this thing for like, us.

2034
02:15:03,100 --> 02:15:05,100
They believed the fact that their cut went to production

2035
02:15:05,100 --> 02:15:07,100
costs should have given them some sort of say in the

2036
02:15:07,100 --> 02:15:09,100
actual business, and they felt Ethan was unfairly

2037
02:15:09,100 --> 02:15:11,100
representing the tone of some of their

2038
02:15:11,100 --> 02:15:13,100
gripes they had with the production. It's clear

2039
02:15:13,100 --> 02:15:15,100
they wanted for enemies to become more independent

2040
02:15:15,100 --> 02:15:17,100
from the H3 podcast, a commitment that Ethan

2041
02:15:17,100 --> 02:15:19,100
didn't want to make, because as previously

2042
02:15:19,100 --> 02:15:21,100
explored, he didn't have the belief that Trisha was

2043
02:15:21,100 --> 02:15:23,100
going to stick around. The five percent is

2044
02:15:23,100 --> 02:15:25,100
brought up, but Trisha also asserts this is in the

2045
02:15:25,100 --> 02:15:27,100
context that H3 keeps a hundred percent of the

2046
02:15:27,100 --> 02:15:29,100
highlights profit, something which Ethan doesn't

2047
02:15:29,100 --> 02:15:31,100
mention in his response video.

2048
02:15:31,100 --> 02:15:33,100
If some percentage is a hundred percent of the

2049
02:15:33,100 --> 02:15:35,100
highlights and five percent of the thing is allowed,

2050
02:15:35,100 --> 02:15:37,100
is allotted for staff, like it would be cool

2051
02:15:37,100 --> 02:15:39,100
again, to get part time somebody,

2052
02:15:39,100 --> 02:15:41,100
and if people are hiring their

2053
02:15:41,100 --> 02:15:43,100
girlfriends, like why not hire my sister?

2054
02:15:43,100 --> 02:15:45,100
She's like, amazing.

2055
02:15:45,100 --> 02:15:47,100
From the beginning, he said a hundred percent of the highlights

2056
02:15:47,100 --> 02:15:49,100
go towards production costs, so I thought

2057
02:15:49,100 --> 02:15:51,100
that meant, let's get new buildings, let's get new

2058
02:15:51,100 --> 02:15:53,100
sets, let's get, you know, because that initial

2059
02:15:53,100 --> 02:15:55,100
investment of 37,000 is a lot,

2060
02:15:55,100 --> 02:15:57,100
but now that we're like making it,

2061
02:15:57,100 --> 02:15:59,100
because it's also money that

2062
02:15:59,100 --> 02:16:01,100
I'm also contributing.

2063
02:16:01,100 --> 02:16:03,100
Trisha does downplay their message to Ethan

2064
02:16:03,100 --> 02:16:05,100
about the crew that they had unwittingly

2065
02:16:05,100 --> 02:16:07,100
exposed the night before, but solidly contends

2066
02:16:07,100 --> 02:16:09,100
this idea that they wanted the crew fired.

2067
02:16:09,100 --> 02:16:11,100
You know,

2068
02:16:11,100 --> 02:16:13,100
there was kind of like a non-starter,

2069
02:16:13,100 --> 02:16:15,100
is she told me that she

2070
02:16:15,100 --> 02:16:17,100
wanted a whole new crew for Frenemies

2071
02:16:17,100 --> 02:16:19,100
because she didn't feel comfortable with them,

2072
02:16:19,100 --> 02:16:21,100
she wanted

2073
02:16:21,100 --> 02:16:23,100
a whole new space,

2074
02:16:23,100 --> 02:16:25,100
she wanted a whole new crew.

2075
02:16:25,100 --> 02:16:27,100
Okay, so, I honestly,

2076
02:16:27,100 --> 02:16:29,100
I'm not saying this just to be gaslight, I really don't

2077
02:16:29,100 --> 02:16:31,100
remember saying I want a whole new crew

2078
02:16:31,100 --> 02:16:33,100
at all, I

2079
02:16:33,100 --> 02:16:35,100
like, because I don't have any, I wouldn't

2080
02:16:35,100 --> 02:16:37,100
have, because he's, the first thing he said to me when I wanted

2081
02:16:37,100 --> 02:16:39,100
was like a producer for Frenemies, like to focus on

2082
02:16:39,100 --> 02:16:41,100
Frenemies, he's like, who do you have in mind? I had someone right away.

2083
02:16:41,100 --> 02:16:43,100
It wasn't a whole new crew to

2084
02:16:43,100 --> 02:16:45,100
replace people, it was like, let's get a

2085
02:16:45,100 --> 02:16:47,100
camera guy, like, for our one-off

2086
02:16:47,100 --> 02:16:49,100
segments on the thing, and they don't do

2087
02:16:49,100 --> 02:16:51,100
any of that, which is, again, fine, because they're very

2088
02:16:51,100 --> 02:16:53,100
casual and relaxed, and they're all kind of like this like

2089
02:16:53,100 --> 02:16:55,100
friend vibe, but it's like, it would be nice to

2090
02:16:55,100 --> 02:16:57,100
have a producer to be able to like this, this, and this.

2091
02:16:57,100 --> 02:16:59,100
One person I asked, I didn't say, fire

2092
02:16:59,100 --> 02:17:01,100
the crew, I didn't, like, I've never

2093
02:17:01,100 --> 02:17:03,100
ever said that.

2094
02:17:03,100 --> 02:17:05,100
This is a real sticking point for Trisha, and in a

2095
02:17:05,100 --> 02:17:07,100
way, it is almost a central narrative to

2096
02:17:07,100 --> 02:17:09,100
understanding what exactly transpired, because

2097
02:17:09,100 --> 02:17:11,100
Ethan obviously fed back that notion that

2098
02:17:11,100 --> 02:17:13,100
Trisha wanted a new crew, and that was what

2099
02:17:13,100 --> 02:17:15,100
provoked the response from them, that eventually

2100
02:17:15,100 --> 02:17:17,100
led up to Trisha losing their call in the DMs

2101
02:17:17,100 --> 02:17:19,100
and quitting the podcast the following morning.

2102
02:17:19,100 --> 02:17:21,100
If Trisha didn't say that, then Ethan may well

2103
02:17:21,100 --> 02:17:23,100
have unfairly framed comments they made,

2104
02:17:23,100 --> 02:17:25,100
even if they weren't very pleasant to begin with.

2105
02:17:25,100 --> 02:17:27,100
We know Trisha wanted someone in their corner,

2106
02:17:27,100 --> 02:17:29,100
but that's different to a complete upheaval,

2107
02:17:29,100 --> 02:17:31,100
and although the DMs certainly don't help their case,

2108
02:17:31,100 --> 02:17:33,100
there is this unresolved detail that does decide

2109
02:17:33,100 --> 02:17:35,100
the tone.

2110
02:17:35,100 --> 02:17:37,100
I want to fire all of them, and get rid of them, and hire a new

2111
02:17:37,100 --> 02:17:39,100
man, and it's like, okay, well that's not a starter for me.

2112
02:17:39,100 --> 02:17:41,100
Fuck off, Ethan, fuck off, like this is exactly why I can't

2113
02:17:41,100 --> 02:17:43,100
even talk to him, because he is, he's such a liar,

2114
02:17:43,100 --> 02:17:45,100
and he's, like, this is such

2115
02:17:45,100 --> 02:17:47,100
a lie, and that he keeps perpetuating

2116
02:17:47,100 --> 02:17:49,100
this, this is what he keeps saying.

2117
02:17:49,100 --> 02:17:51,100
I've never

2118
02:17:51,100 --> 02:17:53,100
once said, let's fire the crew, never

2119
02:17:53,100 --> 02:17:55,100
once said that, on my

2120
02:17:55,100 --> 02:17:57,100
grave. Now I struggle to comment on this

2121
02:17:57,100 --> 02:17:59,100
specifically, but going off the evidence, I can't

2122
02:17:59,100 --> 02:18:01,100
say that Trisha wanted to fire the crew,

2123
02:18:01,100 --> 02:18:03,100
and I don't think they said that explicitly, but

2124
02:18:03,100 --> 02:18:05,100
I think given the comments that we have read, Ethan

2125
02:18:05,100 --> 02:18:07,100
may well have interpreted it that way,

2126
02:18:07,100 --> 02:18:09,100
especially given how they seem to demean the work the crew

2127
02:18:09,100 --> 02:18:11,100
had done, and Trisha has a record of trying

2128
02:18:11,100 --> 02:18:13,100
to push for a particular result without openly

2129
02:18:13,100 --> 02:18:15,100
stating it, they were clearly unhappy with the

2130
02:18:15,100 --> 02:18:17,100
current crew. Once again, it seems like a possible

2131
02:18:17,100 --> 02:18:19,100
miscommunication that could be cleared up,

2132
02:18:19,100 --> 02:18:21,100
but Trisha takes anything like that as a bad faith

2133
02:18:21,100 --> 02:18:23,100
personal attack, and although I could understand

2134
02:18:23,100 --> 02:18:25,100
why they would feel a bit taken out of context,

2135
02:18:25,100 --> 02:18:27,100
this isn't a gossip forum, you're appealing to

2136
02:18:27,100 --> 02:18:29,100
fans of the show, and if you want the audience to not

2137
02:18:29,100 --> 02:18:31,100
view you through that cynical lens, then you have to

2138
02:18:31,100 --> 02:18:33,100
at least lend some charity, especially with what

2139
02:18:33,100 --> 02:18:35,100
you've said, but it's Trisha's choice,

2140
02:18:35,100 --> 02:18:37,100
and after this point in particular, they're clearly

2141
02:18:37,100 --> 02:18:39,100
driven to view Ethan as a liar and a manipulator.

2142
02:18:43,100 --> 02:18:45,100
Trisha, you already did.

2143
02:19:03,100 --> 02:19:09,100
Now, once again, here is where

2144
02:19:09,100 --> 02:19:11,100
the uncharitable perspectives really go

2145
02:19:11,100 --> 02:19:13,100
into gear. Trisha says if Ethan had a problem,

2146
02:19:13,100 --> 02:19:15,100
then he should have ended the podcast, this may

2147
02:19:15,100 --> 02:19:17,100
be a valid point, but you could also argue that

2148
02:19:17,100 --> 02:19:19,100
he wasn't sure of the best way to de-escalate,

2149
02:19:19,100 --> 02:19:21,100
and there's no guarantee that Trisha would have responded

2150
02:19:21,100 --> 02:19:23,100
better to him ending the podcast early,

2151
02:19:23,100 --> 02:19:25,100
regardless, it could have been a mistake on his part.

2152
02:19:25,100 --> 02:19:27,100
However, Trisha interprets this as him wanting

2153
02:19:27,100 --> 02:19:29,100
to get a rise out of them, and to have that

2154
02:19:29,100 --> 02:19:31,100
dramatic walkout moment. Trisha believes

2155
02:19:31,100 --> 02:19:33,100
that Ethan is weaponising their previous meltdowns

2156
02:19:33,100 --> 02:19:35,100
by trying to use them to illustrate

2157
02:19:35,100 --> 02:19:37,100
a double standard. As Trisha's perception of Ethan

2158
02:19:37,100 --> 02:19:39,100
changes, their perception of the whole instant

2159
02:19:39,100 --> 02:19:41,100
changes. Everything is now a manipulative

2160
02:19:41,100 --> 02:19:43,100
tactic on Ethan's part.

2161
02:19:43,100 --> 02:19:45,100
Ultimately, I have to create a safe work environment for my employees.

2162
02:19:45,100 --> 02:19:47,100
So don't err. Why?

2163
02:19:47,100 --> 02:19:49,100
Why? Oh my god.

2164
02:19:49,100 --> 02:19:51,100
This is, it's so, but again, I don't care,

2165
02:19:51,100 --> 02:19:53,100
people call me crazy, I'm used to it, call me crazy,

2166
02:19:53,100 --> 02:19:55,100
it's so manipulative, like, I have to

2167
02:19:55,100 --> 02:19:57,100
create a safe workplace for my employees, it's like,

2168
02:19:57,100 --> 02:19:59,100
you're using this thing, like, I, you know what I mean,

2169
02:19:59,100 --> 02:20:01,100
I mean, you're using these employees,

2170
02:20:01,100 --> 02:20:03,100
I had, you said I disrespected them,

2171
02:20:03,100 --> 02:20:05,100
that was the extent of the issue, like...

2172
02:20:05,100 --> 02:20:07,100
I think the problem is that when Trisha

2173
02:20:07,100 --> 02:20:09,100
vents, it's Trisha, it's what you expect,

2174
02:20:09,100 --> 02:20:11,100
and yet when Ethan vents, it suddenly becomes a personal

2175
02:20:11,100 --> 02:20:13,100
attack to them. I think there are some things that

2176
02:20:13,100 --> 02:20:15,100
Ethan could have been clear about, maybe you could even

2177
02:20:15,100 --> 02:20:17,100
say that as a large public creator, he shouldn't have

2178
02:20:17,100 --> 02:20:19,100
said it, but it's not like I watched Ethan's

2179
02:20:19,100 --> 02:20:21,100
video and didn't understand where he was coming

2180
02:20:21,100 --> 02:20:23,100
from a human perspective. When you lose

2181
02:20:23,100 --> 02:20:25,100
patience with someone, you might say these things

2182
02:20:25,100 --> 02:20:27,100
publicly, and it's not like they come from an invalid

2183
02:20:27,100 --> 02:20:29,100
place.

2184
02:20:29,100 --> 02:20:31,100
...a piece of garbage that, like, I swear

2185
02:20:31,100 --> 02:20:33,100
on my life, like, before this started, I was like, damn,

2186
02:20:33,100 --> 02:20:35,100
I lost a really good friend, but you are such

2187
02:20:35,100 --> 02:20:37,100
a liar, it's so fucked up

2188
02:20:37,100 --> 02:20:39,100
to lie on that, that I, show

2189
02:20:39,100 --> 02:20:41,100
me, like, show me a text where I'm like,

2190
02:20:41,100 --> 02:20:43,100
fire the crew, a conversation, like, that's

2191
02:20:43,100 --> 02:20:45,100
so fucked and twisted,

2192
02:20:45,100 --> 02:20:47,100
just because I've had issues with them, just

2193
02:20:47,100 --> 02:20:49,100
because I've said, like, I don't vibe with them, I don't like their sense

2194
02:20:49,100 --> 02:20:51,100
of humor, I've never said fire

2195
02:20:51,100 --> 02:20:53,100
people, are you fucking kidding me right now?

2196
02:20:53,100 --> 02:20:55,100
Trisha has this concept of

2197
02:20:55,100 --> 02:20:57,100
if you're not with them, you're against them.

2198
02:20:57,100 --> 02:20:59,100
It's like a basic survival instinct, and they

2199
02:20:59,100 --> 02:21:01,100
can't control themselves when responding to these

2200
02:21:01,100 --> 02:21:03,100
videos, so any point of validity they may

2201
02:21:03,100 --> 02:21:05,100
have, and I will try and make a case of them later,

2202
02:21:05,100 --> 02:21:07,100
is lost amongst the anger that someone

2203
02:21:07,100 --> 02:21:09,100
would ever say these things to you in the first place.

2204
02:21:09,100 --> 02:21:11,100
I really...

2205
02:21:11,100 --> 02:21:13,100
I really tried my

2206
02:21:13,100 --> 02:21:15,100
best, like, obviously we have banter

2207
02:21:15,100 --> 02:21:17,100
on the show, but, like, I really don't feel like

2208
02:21:17,100 --> 02:21:19,100
I've been disrespectful,

2209
02:21:19,100 --> 02:21:21,100
like, the idea of shooting that segment down,

2210
02:21:21,100 --> 02:21:23,100
like, that was the disrespectful thing, like, yes, it

2211
02:21:23,100 --> 02:21:25,100
was rude, I'm sorry about it, but, like,

2212
02:21:25,100 --> 02:21:27,100
damn, like, the whole crew,

2213
02:21:27,100 --> 02:21:29,100
you're making up lies, and I want them to be

2214
02:21:29,100 --> 02:21:31,100
fired over that instance, and taking

2215
02:21:31,100 --> 02:21:33,100
this thing that everyone's pissed at me about, and snowballing it,

2216
02:21:33,100 --> 02:21:35,100
and creating this monster thing, and bringing this back up

2217
02:21:35,100 --> 02:21:37,100
in my face, like,

2218
02:21:37,100 --> 02:21:39,100
then why forgive me in the first place?

2219
02:21:39,100 --> 02:21:41,100
Like, don't forgive me, like, just end it

2220
02:21:41,100 --> 02:21:43,100
there. Trisha claims that they're in a pretty good

2221
02:21:43,100 --> 02:21:45,100
place mentally, and they may well be comparatively,

2222
02:21:45,100 --> 02:21:47,100
but they're not adjusted enough to the YouTube

2223
02:21:47,100 --> 02:21:49,100
environment, and these videos are just proof

2224
02:21:49,100 --> 02:21:51,100
of that. It sucks, because once again, I do believe

2225
02:21:51,100 --> 02:21:53,100
I can make sense of Trisha's qualms,

2226
02:21:53,100 --> 02:21:55,100
but these videos did not help.

2227
02:21:55,100 --> 02:21:57,100
I feel like both Trisha and Ethan felt betrayed

2228
02:21:57,100 --> 02:21:59,100
by each other, how Ethan views Trisha's nature

2229
02:21:59,100 --> 02:22:01,100
to take everything public, and impose on reasonable

2230
02:22:01,100 --> 02:22:03,100
standards, and how Trisha views Ethan's

2231
02:22:03,100 --> 02:22:05,100
prejudice towards the situation, and how they

2232
02:22:05,100 --> 02:22:07,100
feel they're trying to mislead their audience.

2233
02:22:07,100 --> 02:22:09,100
Once betrayal becomes that central focus,

2234
02:22:09,100 --> 02:22:11,100
these perspectives are only going to diverge

2235
02:22:11,100 --> 02:22:13,100
further, which is exactly

2236
02:22:13,100 --> 02:22:15,100
what happened next.

2237
02:22:21,100 --> 02:22:25,100
...

2238
02:22:25,100 --> 02:22:27,100
...

2239
02:22:27,100 --> 02:22:29,100
...

2240
02:22:29,100 --> 02:22:31,100
...

2241
02:22:31,100 --> 02:22:33,100
...

2242
02:22:33,100 --> 02:22:35,100
...

2243
02:22:35,100 --> 02:22:37,100
...

2244
02:22:37,100 --> 02:22:39,100
...

2245
02:22:39,100 --> 02:22:41,100
...

2246
02:22:41,100 --> 02:22:43,100
...

2247
02:22:43,100 --> 02:22:45,100
...

2248
02:22:45,100 --> 02:22:47,100
...

2249
02:22:47,100 --> 02:22:49,100
...

2250
02:22:49,100 --> 02:22:51,100
Trisha's videos aren't particularly helpful.

2251
02:22:51,100 --> 02:22:53,100
I think the problem with this sort of content

2252
02:22:53,100 --> 02:22:55,100
is that it focuses on a person's reaction

2253
02:22:55,100 --> 02:22:57,100
in the moment, which when you're dealing with a

2254
02:22:57,100 --> 02:22:59,100
dispute, is obviously going to be more heated

2255
02:22:59,100 --> 02:23:01,100
than if you would give them time to see the bigger

2256
02:23:01,100 --> 02:23:03,100
picture. However, one thing that you could at least

2257
02:23:03,100 --> 02:23:05,100
say is that they were reactions, and therefore

2258
02:23:05,100 --> 02:23:07,100
they should be taken with a pinch of salt,

2259
02:23:07,100 --> 02:23:09,100
even if someone felt the drama was being played

2260
02:23:09,100 --> 02:23:11,100
up by Trisha. They may have been overreactions,

2261
02:23:11,100 --> 02:23:13,100
but they were reactions all the same.

2262
02:23:13,100 --> 02:23:15,100
However, Trisha clearly felt like

2263
02:23:15,100 --> 02:23:17,100
they hadn't quite made their point.

2264
02:23:17,100 --> 02:23:19,100
After a couple days of what some may have

2265
02:23:19,100 --> 02:23:21,100
hoped to be a return to regular content

2266
02:23:21,100 --> 02:23:23,100
for them, Trisha once more uploaded another

2267
02:23:23,100 --> 02:23:25,100
video. This time, though, it wasn't a reaction

2268
02:23:25,100 --> 02:23:27,100
or a response. In fact, its title

2269
02:23:27,100 --> 02:23:29,100
appeared to imply something much more serious,

2270
02:23:29,100 --> 02:23:31,100
with a trigger warning clearly expressed in the

2271
02:23:31,100 --> 02:23:33,100
title. What is the video about itself?

2272
02:23:33,100 --> 02:23:35,100
I put up

2273
02:23:35,100 --> 02:23:37,100
with Ethan purposely

2274
02:23:37,100 --> 02:23:39,100
trying to trigger me

2275
02:23:39,100 --> 02:23:41,100
on multiple occasions.

2276
02:23:41,100 --> 02:23:43,100
I always put up with the triggers,

2277
02:23:43,100 --> 02:23:45,100
and I allowed myself to be triggered

2278
02:23:45,100 --> 02:23:47,100
um,

2279
02:23:47,100 --> 02:23:49,100
and this is beyond, this is not

2280
02:23:49,100 --> 02:23:51,100
walking on eggshells. It's like, oh, I say one wrong

2281
02:23:51,100 --> 02:23:53,100
thing. No, no, no. This is times where I'm like,

2282
02:23:53,100 --> 02:23:55,100
don't share the private messages from episode one

2283
02:23:55,100 --> 02:23:57,100
where he shared messages I sent to him,

2284
02:23:57,100 --> 02:23:59,100
where he shared Moses' private

2285
02:23:59,100 --> 02:24:01,100
messages, and we ask him on the show

2286
02:24:01,100 --> 02:24:03,100
not to. Well, as it's a Trisha

2287
02:24:03,100 --> 02:24:05,100
video, there are a fair few clashing narratives.

2288
02:24:05,100 --> 02:24:07,100
However, the one I'd say is probably

2289
02:24:07,100 --> 02:24:09,100
the most prominent here is that Trisha believes they

2290
02:24:09,100 --> 02:24:11,100
were much more lenient than Ethan gave them

2291
02:24:11,100 --> 02:24:13,100
credit for, despite the fact that they believe Ethan

2292
02:24:13,100 --> 02:24:15,100
attempted to rattle them up on multiple occasions.

2293
02:24:15,100 --> 02:24:17,100
They believe their hand was forced by Ethan's

2294
02:24:17,100 --> 02:24:19,100
persistent provocation, listing a few examples.

2295
02:24:19,100 --> 02:24:21,100
A fair few of these seem to be rather

2296
02:24:21,100 --> 02:24:23,100
insignificant, but the main incident seems

2297
02:24:23,100 --> 02:24:25,100
to resolve around a trip that Ethan, Hila, Trisha,

2298
02:24:25,100 --> 02:24:27,100
and their family took to Disney. This was

2299
02:24:27,100 --> 02:24:29,100
recorded and uploaded in vlog form to

2300
02:24:29,100 --> 02:24:31,100
the H3 Podcast channel, and it was

2301
02:24:31,100 --> 02:24:33,100
pretty well received at the time. However, Trisha

2302
02:24:33,100 --> 02:24:35,100
seems rather perturbed by a comment Ethan made

2303
02:24:35,100 --> 02:24:37,100
during this trip about an incident they had also

2304
02:24:37,100 --> 02:24:39,100
briefly spoken about on the podcast.

2305
02:24:39,100 --> 02:24:41,100
I want to talk about it. The first things that come to

2306
02:24:41,100 --> 02:24:43,100
mind obviously are talking to my mom

2307
02:24:43,100 --> 02:24:45,100
about my sexual assault on

2308
02:24:45,100 --> 02:24:47,100
a trip from Disneyland, a trip

2309
02:24:47,100 --> 02:24:49,100
that my mom, sister, and Moses had planned for my birthday

2310
02:24:49,100 --> 02:24:51,100
and then we did invite

2311
02:24:51,100 --> 02:24:53,100
Ethan and Hila to come

2312
02:24:53,100 --> 02:24:55,100
willingly and graciously because I

2313
02:24:55,100 --> 02:24:57,100
I enjoyed

2314
02:24:57,100 --> 02:24:59,100
spending time with them there, you know.

2315
02:24:59,100 --> 02:25:01,100
Okay, let me at least explain myself.

2316
02:25:01,100 --> 02:25:03,100
No! Let me at least explain

2317
02:25:03,100 --> 02:25:05,100
myself. Okay.

2318
02:25:05,100 --> 02:25:07,100
We're on the party bus, and

2319
02:25:07,100 --> 02:25:09,100
I, we all got our own pizzas.

2320
02:25:09,100 --> 02:25:11,100
I had my, you know, I love the

2321
02:25:11,100 --> 02:25:13,100
pineapple, uh,

2322
02:25:13,100 --> 02:25:15,100
black olive, uh, nobody

2323
02:25:15,100 --> 02:25:17,100
else wanted it, so I started picking the cheese

2324
02:25:17,100 --> 02:25:19,100
off. Okay? And I was

2325
02:25:19,100 --> 02:25:21,100
just eating the toppings, and the pizza looked like

2326
02:25:21,100 --> 02:25:23,100
a burn victim, it was all disgusting.

2327
02:25:23,100 --> 02:25:25,100
So anyway, you looked at it and you're like, that is so

2328
02:25:25,100 --> 02:25:27,100
disgusting, I can't look at it, like that's just the

2329
02:25:27,100 --> 02:25:29,100
grossest thing I've ever seen. Yeah, it was really gross, I

2330
02:25:29,100 --> 02:25:31,100
physically had to lay down after it. And I said,

2331
02:25:31,100 --> 02:25:33,100
I said, Trisha, who are

2332
02:25:33,100 --> 02:25:35,100
you to talk about gross

2333
02:25:35,100 --> 02:25:37,100
things? You've shoved a candlestick

2334
02:25:37,100 --> 02:25:39,100
up your ass. Uh-huh. But the reason

2335
02:25:39,100 --> 02:25:41,100
I said it is because they

2336
02:25:41,100 --> 02:25:43,100
literally know everything

2337
02:25:43,100 --> 02:25:45,100
about this show. Why would I? Which

2338
02:25:45,100 --> 02:25:47,100
means that I know that they

2339
02:25:47,100 --> 02:25:49,100
know the meme. It's not something they want to talk about

2340
02:25:49,100 --> 02:25:51,100
or you want to bring up in front of your family. Okay, fine, fine, fine,

2341
02:25:51,100 --> 02:25:53,100
but like, well, they were looking

2342
02:25:53,100 --> 02:25:55,100
at me like, ugh,

2343
02:25:55,100 --> 02:25:57,100
okay, maybe I fucked up.

2344
02:25:57,100 --> 02:25:59,100
Alongside the other

2345
02:25:59,100 --> 02:26:01,100
examples, it feels like Trisha is having one

2346
02:26:01,100 --> 02:26:03,100
of their revelations in rationalizing

2347
02:26:03,100 --> 02:26:05,100
their own behavior, crafting this narrative

2348
02:26:05,100 --> 02:26:07,100
that their reaction was actually the result of continuous

2349
02:26:07,100 --> 02:26:09,100
comments and incidents that they failed to

2350
02:26:09,100 --> 02:26:11,100
address themselves, and therefore let boil over

2351
02:26:11,100 --> 02:26:13,100
in the eventual meltdown that occurred in that

2352
02:26:13,100 --> 02:26:15,100
fateful episode. However, one really has to

2353
02:26:15,100 --> 02:26:17,100
question what motivated them to use such a

2354
02:26:17,100 --> 02:26:19,100
provocative title, when the topic, although

2355
02:26:19,100 --> 02:26:21,100
somewhat sensitive, isn't exactly communicated

2356
02:26:21,100 --> 02:26:23,100
with the same sense of pertinence to the actual

2357
02:26:23,100 --> 02:26:25,100
subject being discussed. I'm not trying to say a

2358
02:26:25,100 --> 02:26:27,100
trigger warning was unnecessary, or that it makes

2359
02:26:27,100 --> 02:26:29,100
any discourse of it less valid, but in the

2360
02:26:29,100 --> 02:26:31,100
established canon of Trisha's upload history on

2361
02:26:31,100 --> 02:26:33,100
Frenemies, the video advertises itself as much

2362
02:26:33,100 --> 02:26:35,100
more serious than other content that they have produced

2363
02:26:35,100 --> 02:26:37,100
on this specific matter, despite the fact that this

2364
02:26:37,100 --> 02:26:39,100
was once more an analysis of the often fractured

2365
02:26:39,100 --> 02:26:41,100
dynamic between the two. However, it is

2366
02:26:41,100 --> 02:26:43,100
a bit more accusatory given that Trisha alleges

2367
02:26:43,100 --> 02:26:45,100
that Ethan's provocation of them was intentional.

2368
02:26:45,100 --> 02:26:47,100
Like, all of that was like

2369
02:26:47,100 --> 02:26:49,100
triggers, right? When I asked to the very last

2370
02:26:49,100 --> 02:26:51,100
episode, like, we need to stop, we need

2371
02:26:51,100 --> 02:26:53,100
to stop, and he's like, yes, you can go up and leave

2372
02:26:53,100 --> 02:26:55,100
whenever you want, you know what I mean? Like, up until

2373
02:26:55,100 --> 02:26:57,100
even that point, he wanted me to do that thing, and

2374
02:26:57,100 --> 02:26:59,100
I'm like, I just want to end this. This represents

2375
02:26:59,100 --> 02:27:01,100
this increasingly cynical perspective

2376
02:27:01,100 --> 02:27:03,100
that each party held of each other, and in his

2377
02:27:03,100 --> 02:27:05,100
response, Ethan followed suit. Now,

2378
02:27:05,100 --> 02:27:07,100
given his relevance to the situation, it's

2379
02:27:07,100 --> 02:27:09,100
no surprise that Ethan wasn't too flattered

2380
02:27:09,100 --> 02:27:11,100
by how the video was publicised.

2381
02:27:11,100 --> 02:27:13,100
However, he decided to go one step further, stating

2382
02:27:13,100 --> 02:27:15,100
that Trisha's video on the matter goes as

2383
02:27:15,100 --> 02:27:17,100
far to accuse him of sexual harassment,

2384
02:27:17,100 --> 02:27:19,100
specifically referring to the comments

2385
02:27:19,100 --> 02:27:21,100
that Trisha made about his commentary on their new

2386
02:27:21,100 --> 02:27:23,100
skin product.

2387
02:27:23,100 --> 02:27:25,100
And then up until, like, the last

2388
02:27:25,100 --> 02:27:27,100
episode, like, everyone was like, it's clear Trisha

2389
02:27:27,100 --> 02:27:29,100
was in a bad mood, but

2390
02:27:29,100 --> 02:27:31,100
it was a lot of things from sexualising

2391
02:27:31,100 --> 02:27:33,100
my skincare product, like, you know, I was just like

2392
02:27:33,100 --> 02:27:35,100
that, I was like, you know,

2393
02:27:35,100 --> 02:27:37,100
because it's not just my line.

2394
02:27:37,100 --> 02:27:39,100
I would stop short of saying that Trish was trying to

2395
02:27:39,100 --> 02:27:41,100
accuse him of sexual harassment, but I also don't

2396
02:27:41,100 --> 02:27:43,100
really understand why Ethan's observation

2397
02:27:43,100 --> 02:27:45,100
had to be construed as sexual, as they

2398
02:27:45,100 --> 02:27:47,100
say in the episode, it's childish humour,

2399
02:27:47,100 --> 02:27:49,100
seeing something perhaps rude in an otherwise

2400
02:27:49,100 --> 02:27:51,100
unassuming scene.

2401
02:27:51,100 --> 02:27:53,100
This is the secret, I'm so happy to finally

2402
02:27:53,100 --> 02:27:55,100
Also kind of phallic. What?

2403
02:27:55,100 --> 02:27:57,100
You say, Trish, what's the secret? And then you show

2404
02:27:57,100 --> 02:27:59,100
It looks like a cock, balls

2405
02:27:59,100 --> 02:28:01,100
and cock. What are you talking about?

2406
02:28:01,100 --> 02:28:03,100
Look, two balls and a cock, it's like

2407
02:28:03,100 --> 02:28:05,100
a giant phallic. Oh my god, it's the

2408
02:28:05,100 --> 02:28:07,100
products in the thing. Bro, it's literally

2409
02:28:07,100 --> 02:28:09,100
a penis.

2410
02:28:09,100 --> 02:28:11,100
You are so, so

2411
02:28:11,100 --> 02:28:13,100
annihilated. With that in mind, I can

2412
02:28:13,100 --> 02:28:15,100
understand why Ethan feels like he's being misrepresented.

2413
02:28:15,100 --> 02:28:17,100
How the draw towards a discussion

2414
02:28:17,100 --> 02:28:19,100
surrounding the semantics of sexual harassment

2415
02:28:19,100 --> 02:28:21,100
feels a bit sudden, and Trisha once

2416
02:28:21,100 --> 02:28:23,100
more jumps on that to quickly defend themselves

2417
02:28:23,100 --> 02:28:25,100
and say they weren't accusing anyone of such

2418
02:28:25,100 --> 02:28:27,100
a claim. Harking on Ethan's previous comments

2419
02:28:27,100 --> 02:28:29,100
about them wanting to fire the crew suggests

2420
02:28:29,100 --> 02:28:31,100
that he has a bit of a habit of strawmanning

2421
02:28:31,100 --> 02:28:33,100
Trisha's comments. At this point, Trisha

2422
02:28:33,100 --> 02:28:35,100
and Ethan couldn't even agree on what each other

2423
02:28:35,100 --> 02:28:37,100
were saying, but some felt like Trisha blurred the

2424
02:28:37,100 --> 02:28:39,100
line in their comments with the intent of taking advantage

2425
02:28:39,100 --> 02:28:41,100
of Ethan's defensive response, while critics

2426
02:28:41,100 --> 02:28:43,100
of Ethan thought he was trying to stir up emotion against

2427
02:28:43,100 --> 02:28:45,100
Trisha by making their claim seem stronger than

2428
02:28:45,100 --> 02:28:47,100
they were. Ethan

2429
02:28:47,100 --> 02:28:49,100
incidentally invited

2430
02:28:49,100 --> 02:28:51,100
himself to

2431
02:28:51,100 --> 02:28:53,100
our family's surprise.

2432
02:28:53,100 --> 02:28:55,100
And

2433
02:28:55,100 --> 02:28:57,100
we paid

2434
02:28:57,100 --> 02:28:59,100
for him. Ethan and Hila did not

2435
02:28:59,100 --> 02:29:01,100
pay for their VIP ticket to Disneyland.

2436
02:29:01,100 --> 02:29:03,100
We ended up

2437
02:29:03,100 --> 02:29:05,100
paying for Ethan and Hila,

2438
02:29:05,100 --> 02:29:07,100
which is crazy

2439
02:29:07,100 --> 02:29:09,100
because he takes that 5%

2440
02:29:09,100 --> 02:29:11,100
and VIP tickets

2441
02:29:11,100 --> 02:29:13,100
to Disneyland is not cheap.

2442
02:29:13,100 --> 02:29:15,100
And I don't know why he felt compelled

2443
02:29:15,100 --> 02:29:17,100
to ask me

2444
02:29:17,100 --> 02:29:19,100
and my mom or bring it up

2445
02:29:19,100 --> 02:29:21,100
in the situation that

2446
02:29:21,100 --> 02:29:23,100
how we felt about her

2447
02:29:23,100 --> 02:29:25,100
having a candlestick

2448
02:29:25,100 --> 02:29:27,100
up her you know what

2449
02:29:27,100 --> 02:29:29,100
it made us very uncomfortable, especially

2450
02:29:29,100 --> 02:29:31,100
we had just such a fun day

2451
02:29:31,100 --> 02:29:33,100
and

2452
02:29:33,100 --> 02:29:35,100
it was really disgusting.

2453
02:29:35,100 --> 02:29:37,100
I think that he wanted

2454
02:29:37,100 --> 02:29:39,100
the shock value, but I think that

2455
02:29:39,100 --> 02:29:41,100
he forgets that we're

2456
02:29:41,100 --> 02:29:43,100
family at the end of the day

2457
02:29:43,100 --> 02:29:45,100
and I was not appreciative

2458
02:29:45,100 --> 02:29:47,100
of that. The next few days though

2459
02:29:47,100 --> 02:29:49,100
were just pure chaos. Trisha's sister

2460
02:29:49,100 --> 02:29:51,100
decided to weigh in, supporting Trisha's statement

2461
02:29:51,100 --> 02:29:53,100
and alleging that Ethan and Hila invited

2462
02:29:53,100 --> 02:29:55,100
themselves to Disney and had their tickets paid

2463
02:29:55,100 --> 02:29:57,100
for. Ethan then responds to this sister

2464
02:29:57,100 --> 02:29:59,100
Carly on the After Dark podcast,

2465
02:29:59,100 --> 02:30:01,100
trying to take a more jocular outlook on the whole

2466
02:30:01,100 --> 02:30:03,100
situation, but still visibly irritated.

2467
02:30:03,100 --> 02:30:05,100
And to be honest with you guys,

2468
02:30:05,100 --> 02:30:07,100
I'm just trying to make the best

2469
02:30:07,100 --> 02:30:09,100
of this situation that is quite

2470
02:30:09,100 --> 02:30:11,100
sour to be frank.

2471
02:30:11,100 --> 02:30:13,100
And so, I watched this

2472
02:30:13,100 --> 02:30:15,100
with peace and love. So she's

2473
02:30:15,100 --> 02:30:17,100
first of all saying we invited ourselves

2474
02:30:17,100 --> 02:30:19,100
for a surprise party.

2475
02:30:19,100 --> 02:30:21,100
This is where

2476
02:30:21,100 --> 02:30:23,100
it's just so frustrating for me.

2477
02:30:23,100 --> 02:30:25,100
You know, we obviously

2478
02:30:25,100 --> 02:30:27,100
didn't invite ourselves.

2479
02:30:27,100 --> 02:30:29,100
We were invited,

2480
02:30:29,100 --> 02:30:31,100
as Trisha even says in her

2481
02:30:31,100 --> 02:30:33,100
video. It's like they can't even keep their stories

2482
02:30:33,100 --> 02:30:35,100
straight. Trisha then responds to H3

2483
02:30:35,100 --> 02:30:37,100
calling them out for this and saying that the sister

2484
02:30:37,100 --> 02:30:39,100
isn't involved, but also being sufficiently

2485
02:30:39,100 --> 02:30:41,100
passive aggressive to boot, and it just felt like

2486
02:30:41,100 --> 02:30:43,100
this endless cycle of people trying to have the

2487
02:30:43,100 --> 02:30:45,100
final word. When everyone wants the final word,

2488
02:30:45,100 --> 02:30:47,100
no one's gonna have it.

2489
02:30:47,100 --> 02:30:49,100
Ethan has this thing where he punched down on people, right?

2490
02:30:49,100 --> 02:30:51,100
Like, he obviously knows he has a really loyal

2491
02:30:51,100 --> 02:30:53,100
fanbase, and they're a really loud fanbase.

2492
02:30:53,100 --> 02:30:55,100
I'm obviously the one getting all the hate. They see

2493
02:30:55,100 --> 02:30:57,100
that. So for them to do this video like defending themselves

2494
02:30:57,100 --> 02:30:59,100
when I'm the one getting all the hate, it's like

2495
02:30:59,100 --> 02:31:01,100
it's really just punching down. It's just punching, punching,

2496
02:31:01,100 --> 02:31:03,100
punching when it's low. My sister deleted that TikTok

2497
02:31:03,100 --> 02:31:05,100
within an hour. Trisha's newest video

2498
02:31:05,100 --> 02:31:07,100
had further sought to justify their own perspective by

2499
02:31:07,100 --> 02:31:09,100
making Ethan look more unreasonable than he

2500
02:31:09,100 --> 02:31:11,100
believed himself to be. Allegations that

2501
02:31:11,100 --> 02:31:13,100
although he tried to laugh at, he clearly construed

2502
02:31:13,100 --> 02:31:15,100
as very serious, and similarly hit back

2503
02:31:15,100 --> 02:31:17,100
at Trisha, and as they took to social media

2504
02:31:17,100 --> 02:31:19,100
to relentlessly attack each other, it began to

2505
02:31:19,100 --> 02:31:21,100
feel like there may be no way back.

2506
02:31:21,100 --> 02:31:23,100
However, if one fact is indisputable,

2507
02:31:23,100 --> 02:31:25,100
Trisha is consistently

2508
02:31:25,100 --> 02:31:27,100
inconsistent, and although that would

2509
02:31:27,100 --> 02:31:29,100
once again change their tone,

2510
02:31:29,100 --> 02:31:31,100
this time, it didn't quite

2511
02:31:31,100 --> 02:31:33,100
heal the wound.

2512
02:31:35,100 --> 02:31:37,100
With each of Trisha's videos,

2513
02:31:37,100 --> 02:31:39,100
it felt strange, because in spite of the fact that they were

2514
02:31:39,100 --> 02:31:41,100
clearly unhappy with Ethan Klein, there also

2515
02:31:41,100 --> 02:31:43,100
appeared to be this expectation that by the

2516
02:31:43,100 --> 02:31:45,100
next Tuesday, they'd be back at the studio,

2517
02:31:45,100 --> 02:31:47,100
and this would all be water under the bridge.

2518
02:31:47,100 --> 02:31:49,100
Trisha even eludes to this themself in a tweet,

2519
02:31:49,100 --> 02:31:51,100
one which Ethan very quickly rebuked.

2520
02:31:51,100 --> 02:31:53,100
I'm not a subscriber to the school of philosophy

2521
02:31:53,100 --> 02:31:55,100
that believed Trisha was only upset about the money,

2522
02:31:55,100 --> 02:31:57,100
and it's not that I don't think there were no legitimate

2523
02:31:57,100 --> 02:31:59,100
qualms, but it felt like Trisha's videos

2524
02:31:59,100 --> 02:32:01,100
from a certain point were designed to elicit a

2525
02:32:01,100 --> 02:32:03,100
reaction from Ethan, and I don't think they did

2526
02:32:03,100 --> 02:32:05,100
because they loathed Ethan or they wanted to hurt

2527
02:32:05,100 --> 02:32:07,100
him. I think it's because they almost wanted to play

2528
02:32:07,100 --> 02:32:09,100
out the situation so that there could be some

2529
02:32:09,100 --> 02:32:11,100
degree of mutual responsibility spread

2530
02:32:11,100 --> 02:32:13,100
to the point where they would be inclined to

2531
02:32:13,100 --> 02:32:15,100
patch it up on the podcast.

2532
02:32:15,100 --> 02:32:17,100
Although leaving with the usual fireworks, it's

2533
02:32:17,100 --> 02:32:19,100
clear that Trisha still had a part of them tied

2534
02:32:19,100 --> 02:32:21,100
to the podcast, even at one point starting

2535
02:32:21,100 --> 02:32:23,100
their own show called Enemies, which as you can

2536
02:32:23,100 --> 02:32:25,100
assume was Frenemies without Ethan,

2537
02:32:25,100 --> 02:32:27,100
something they referred to a few times.

2538
02:32:27,100 --> 02:32:29,100
So, yeah, this is the podcast

2539
02:32:29,100 --> 02:32:31,100
Enemies, so I just

2540
02:32:31,100 --> 02:32:33,100
make enemies, because

2541
02:32:33,100 --> 02:32:35,100
that's just what I do, and I guess

2542
02:32:35,100 --> 02:32:37,100
I own up to it.

2543
02:32:37,600 --> 02:32:39,600
I actually don't want enemies. I will speak the

2544
02:32:39,600 --> 02:32:41,600
same truth I spoke on Frenemies, but people

2545
02:32:41,600 --> 02:32:43,600
don't care if there's not a man next to me.

2546
02:32:43,600 --> 02:32:45,600
And that's just the world we live in.

2547
02:32:45,600 --> 02:32:47,600
I'm not trying to be over here like a feminist, whatever.

2548
02:32:47,600 --> 02:32:49,600
I'm fine with that. I'm happy to leech on to

2549
02:32:49,600 --> 02:32:51,600
another dude for my next

2550
02:32:51,600 --> 02:32:53,600
venture. That's just how it has to

2551
02:32:53,600 --> 02:32:55,600
be if my voice is going to be heard.

2552
02:32:55,600 --> 02:32:57,600
I have an apology to

2553
02:32:57,600 --> 02:32:59,600
Ethan and the staff

2554
02:32:59,600 --> 02:33:01,600
coming out this week.

2555
02:33:01,600 --> 02:33:03,600
Ethan.

2556
02:33:03,600 --> 02:33:05,600
Go watch

2557
02:33:05,600 --> 02:33:07,600
Frenemies. I support

2558
02:33:07,600 --> 02:33:09,600
him having a new co-host

2559
02:33:09,600 --> 02:33:11,600
or co-hosts if he has multiple.

2560
02:33:11,600 --> 02:33:13,600
We had ad reads for the whole year, so

2561
02:33:13,600 --> 02:33:15,600
you know, get that bag, get that coin.

2562
02:33:15,600 --> 02:33:17,600
In the past, this sort of outburst

2563
02:33:17,600 --> 02:33:19,600
had motivated Ethan to bring on Dr. Drew,

2564
02:33:19,600 --> 02:33:21,600
discuss their differences, and find some

2565
02:33:21,600 --> 02:33:23,600
sort of compromise on how to move forward,

2566
02:33:23,600 --> 02:33:25,600
something that once again Trisha references

2567
02:33:25,600 --> 02:33:27,600
in one of their response videos. However, this time

2568
02:33:27,600 --> 02:33:29,600
Ethan didn't really change his tune, and wasn't

2569
02:33:29,600 --> 02:33:31,600
interested in resolving any differences between

2570
02:33:31,600 --> 02:33:33,600
himself and Trisha with their relationship in the

2571
02:33:33,600 --> 02:33:35,600
state that it was. In less than 24 hours

2572
02:33:35,600 --> 02:33:37,600
after the launch of Trisha's new podcast, where

2573
02:33:37,600 --> 02:33:39,600
they take multiple jabs at Ethan, there is

2574
02:33:39,600 --> 02:33:41,600
once more a change of message.

2575
02:34:03,600 --> 02:34:29,600
Yes. In this video

2576
02:34:29,600 --> 02:34:31,600
called Apology to Ethan, Trisha reveals

2577
02:34:31,600 --> 02:34:33,600
that they've been taking better care of

2578
02:34:33,600 --> 02:34:35,600
themselves, and have come to the conclusion that they

2579
02:34:35,600 --> 02:34:37,600
actually have some apologising to do.

2580
02:34:37,600 --> 02:34:39,600
Fantastic.

2581
02:35:01,600 --> 02:35:19,600
After a rather meandering menaces

2582
02:35:19,600 --> 02:35:21,600
of their mental health, they speak about how

2583
02:35:21,600 --> 02:35:23,600
much they have messed up. They don't really speak about

2584
02:35:23,600 --> 02:35:25,600
too many of the issues in depth, but they try

2585
02:35:25,600 --> 02:35:27,600
to elaborate on their mindset, and how this

2586
02:35:27,600 --> 02:35:29,600
impacted their behaviour towards the clients,

2587
02:35:29,600 --> 02:35:31,600
and how they felt responsible for sabotaging

2588
02:35:31,600 --> 02:35:33,600
the podcast because of their feelings. Of the

2589
02:35:33,600 --> 02:35:35,600
incidents in question, they do apologise for the

2590
02:35:35,600 --> 02:35:37,600
distasteful jokes they made in the DMs that they

2591
02:35:37,600 --> 02:35:39,600
leaked. They also apologise for not going to Ethan

2592
02:35:39,600 --> 02:35:41,600
privately, and just generally their demeanour in

2593
02:35:41,600 --> 02:35:43,600
how it impacted those around them. Frame those

2594
02:35:43,600 --> 02:35:45,600
actions as ones yielded from an unhealthy

2595
02:35:45,600 --> 02:35:47,600
mindset.

2596
02:35:59,600 --> 02:36:01,600
I see exactly

2597
02:36:01,600 --> 02:36:03,600
how it came

2598
02:36:03,600 --> 02:36:05,600
across, and I see it very clearly

2599
02:36:05,600 --> 02:36:07,600
and I'm so embarrassed

2600
02:36:07,600 --> 02:36:09,600
because, again, I'm

2601
02:36:09,600 --> 02:36:11,600
a mess. I'm a messy person. I'm drama.

2602
02:36:11,600 --> 02:36:13,600
I have issues, as everyone

2603
02:36:13,600 --> 02:36:15,600
does, but I've always prided myself

2604
02:36:15,600 --> 02:36:17,600
on being a nice person.

2605
02:36:17,600 --> 02:36:19,600
I apologise for bringing up money. I apologise

2606
02:36:19,600 --> 02:36:21,600
for just really, again, poor

2607
02:36:21,600 --> 02:36:23,600
communication. I feel like I've worked on communication

2608
02:36:23,600 --> 02:36:25,600
so much in my relationship that I've neglected

2609
02:36:25,600 --> 02:36:27,600
to work on communication on

2610
02:36:27,600 --> 02:36:29,600
other ways, like speaking up when

2611
02:36:29,600 --> 02:36:31,600
even little things, speaking up if I don't like

2612
02:36:31,600 --> 02:36:33,600
something or don't think, you know, I'm such a hype person

2613
02:36:33,600 --> 02:36:35,600
I like to, like, hype everything. I love it,

2614
02:36:35,600 --> 02:36:37,600
love it, love it, and then, like, it got me in trouble

2615
02:36:37,600 --> 02:36:39,600
with Nikocado and I was like, yes, let's hang out

2616
02:36:39,600 --> 02:36:41,600
and then I hype, hype, hype, and then ghost because

2617
02:36:41,600 --> 02:36:43,600
I love to hype. I don't ever

2618
02:36:43,600 --> 02:36:45,600
like to shoot down ideas. I don't, you know what I mean, but

2619
02:36:45,600 --> 02:36:47,600
I really need to

2620
02:36:47,600 --> 02:36:49,600
be better at communicating when I don't

2621
02:36:49,600 --> 02:36:51,600
like something. I don't want to do something and just be

2622
02:36:51,600 --> 02:36:53,600
better at it and just grow a pair

2623
02:36:53,600 --> 02:36:55,600
of balls and talk about it.

2624
02:36:55,600 --> 02:36:57,600
I'm really sorry. I really am.

2625
02:36:57,600 --> 02:36:59,600
It's, it's now

2626
02:36:59,600 --> 02:37:01,600
the stages of

2627
02:37:01,600 --> 02:37:03,600
a Trish freak out and

2628
02:37:07,600 --> 02:37:09,600
like, I feel

2629
02:37:09,600 --> 02:37:11,600
good, I feel strong, I feel like

2630
02:37:11,600 --> 02:37:13,600
loved and cared

2631
02:37:13,600 --> 02:37:15,600
for over here. Even the

2632
02:37:15,600 --> 02:37:17,600
crew and Hila, that

2633
02:37:17,600 --> 02:37:19,600
I'm sorry

2634
02:37:19,600 --> 02:37:21,600
and I hope

2635
02:37:21,600 --> 02:37:23,600
in time that we

2636
02:37:23,600 --> 02:37:25,600
will be able to

2637
02:37:25,600 --> 02:37:27,600
talk again. Like,

2638
02:37:27,600 --> 02:37:29,600
I know once Trish is broken, like,

2639
02:37:29,600 --> 02:37:31,600
it's nearly impossible

2640
02:37:33,600 --> 02:37:35,600
to gain back, but

2641
02:37:35,600 --> 02:37:37,600
I'm willing

2642
02:37:37,600 --> 02:37:39,600
to put an effort.

2643
02:37:39,600 --> 02:37:41,600
I don't think it's necessarily the wrong way to

2644
02:37:41,600 --> 02:37:43,600
go about it. It's important that you make people understand

2645
02:37:43,600 --> 02:37:45,600
where you're coming from, and how a mindset may have

2646
02:37:45,600 --> 02:37:47,600
caused you to act out in a particular way,

2647
02:37:47,600 --> 02:37:49,600
and some appear to praise him for this. However,

2648
02:37:49,600 --> 02:37:51,600
some also question whether this should have been done privately

2649
02:37:51,600 --> 02:37:53,600
first, and not too long after, Ethan

2650
02:37:53,600 --> 02:37:55,600
Klein replied, echoing other people's issues

2651
02:37:55,600 --> 02:37:57,600
and emphasising the damage he believed they had caused

2652
02:37:57,600 --> 02:37:59,600
with their prior content.

2653
02:37:59,600 --> 02:38:01,600
She said in her video,

2654
02:38:01,600 --> 02:38:03,600
I'm gonna make this apology, and

2655
02:38:03,600 --> 02:38:05,600
Ethan doesn't have to accept it.

2656
02:38:05,600 --> 02:38:07,600
It's not

2657
02:38:07,600 --> 02:38:09,600
that I don't accept her apology,

2658
02:38:09,600 --> 02:38:11,600
it's that I just,

2659
02:38:11,600 --> 02:38:13,600
I don't wanna gloss over

2660
02:38:13,600 --> 02:38:15,600
too much what went down.

2661
02:38:15,600 --> 02:38:17,600
I mean,

2662
02:38:17,600 --> 02:38:19,600
it's a lot for me to forgive this

2663
02:38:19,600 --> 02:38:21,600
fast. Now, I think a public apology for a

2664
02:38:21,600 --> 02:38:23,600
public issue is always useful, because viewers

2665
02:38:23,600 --> 02:38:25,600
know where you stand, but Trisha had reached a stage

2666
02:38:25,600 --> 02:38:27,600
where so much of themselves was online that

2667
02:38:27,600 --> 02:38:29,600
each public video felt performative,

2668
02:38:29,600 --> 02:38:31,600
and therefore Ethan was going to be suspicious of

2669
02:38:31,600 --> 02:38:33,600
this sudden about turn, even for Trisha.

2670
02:38:33,600 --> 02:38:35,600
I think the problem, and this

2671
02:38:35,600 --> 02:38:37,600
once again ties back to Dr. Drew, with the previous

2672
02:38:37,600 --> 02:38:39,600
onset of disputes, it became an established

2673
02:38:39,600 --> 02:38:41,600
solution to almost use other things as a

2674
02:38:41,600 --> 02:38:43,600
medium to channel frustrations that they weren't

2675
02:38:43,600 --> 02:38:45,600
prepared to express. Let things escalate, and

2676
02:38:45,600 --> 02:38:47,600
then rely on the other party's recognition of that matter.

2677
02:38:47,600 --> 02:38:49,600
I don't doubt that Trisha likely had qualms with the

2678
02:38:49,600 --> 02:38:51,600
process of the podcast, and didn't know how to express

2679
02:38:51,600 --> 02:38:53,600
them at first, or lashed out unnecessarily.

2680
02:38:53,600 --> 02:38:55,600
However, with the context of the subsequent videos

2681
02:38:55,600 --> 02:38:57,600
and the apology, the initial departure didn't

2682
02:38:57,600 --> 02:38:59,600
actually feel like a genuine expression of intent.

2683
02:38:59,600 --> 02:39:01,600
It felt like a way to once again make a statement

2684
02:39:01,600 --> 02:39:03,600
on a problem that they perceived. In many of

2685
02:39:03,600 --> 02:39:05,600
these videos, Trisha would emphasise how their

2686
02:39:05,600 --> 02:39:07,600
sound of mind now, either due to therapy,

2687
02:39:07,600 --> 02:39:09,600
or changes to their lifestyle, as a way to

2688
02:39:09,600 --> 02:39:11,600
justify how this was them now speaking

2689
02:39:11,600 --> 02:39:13,600
with clarity. It was a way to

2690
02:39:13,600 --> 02:39:15,600
frame their past behaviour as impulsive,

2691
02:39:15,600 --> 02:39:17,600
not the real them, but with this, it was

2692
02:39:17,600 --> 02:39:19,600
difficult to know when we were ever receiving

2693
02:39:19,600 --> 02:39:21,600
the real Trisha. It felt like Trisha was trying

2694
02:39:21,600 --> 02:39:23,600
different techniques for the same result, trying

2695
02:39:23,600 --> 02:39:25,600
to present each one as their real

2696
02:39:25,600 --> 02:39:27,600
findings, and then gauging reaction.

2697
02:39:27,600 --> 02:39:29,600
Despite my criticisms though, I will say

2698
02:39:29,600 --> 02:39:31,600
one thing. It showed that regardless of the defensive

2699
02:39:31,600 --> 02:39:33,600
fronts, that Trisha still clearly

2700
02:39:33,600 --> 02:39:35,600
cared about their friendship with Ethan. Really,

2701
02:39:35,600 --> 02:39:37,600
all these methods screamed to me that this was

2702
02:39:37,600 --> 02:39:39,600
someone who wanted something, but didn't know how

2703
02:39:39,600 --> 02:39:41,600
to get it. Unfortunately, because of previous

2704
02:39:41,600 --> 02:39:43,600
instances, it seemed that the easiest route was

2705
02:39:43,600 --> 02:39:45,600
to be somewhat hostile. This time, however,

2706
02:39:45,600 --> 02:39:47,600
Ethan drew a line, and in spite of what may have

2707
02:39:47,600 --> 02:39:49,600
been an apology, Ethan couldn't accept

2708
02:39:49,600 --> 02:39:51,600
it. He acknowledged, and even

2709
02:39:51,600 --> 02:39:53,600
appreciated it, but he stopped short of accepting

2710
02:39:53,600 --> 02:39:55,600
it. The apology may have

2711
02:39:55,600 --> 02:39:57,600
come from a genuine place, who knows,

2712
02:39:57,600 --> 02:39:59,600
but it couldn't overshadow the fact that it

2713
02:39:59,600 --> 02:40:01,600
followed two weeks of continuous public

2714
02:40:01,600 --> 02:40:03,600
mudsling. It felt like Trisha was looking

2715
02:40:03,600 --> 02:40:05,600
for the ends, but didn't understand

2716
02:40:05,600 --> 02:40:07,600
the means. If this was 20 days earlier,

2717
02:40:07,600 --> 02:40:09,600
then maybe it would have started rebuilding

2718
02:40:09,600 --> 02:40:11,600
that bridge, but at this point, the ravine

2719
02:40:11,600 --> 02:40:13,600
between the two was just far too wide.

2720
02:40:13,600 --> 02:40:15,600
How was Ethan to know that this wasn't just

2721
02:40:15,600 --> 02:40:17,600
another vehicle in an attempt to

2722
02:40:17,600 --> 02:40:19,600
relaunch Frenemies? There were lots of

2723
02:40:19,600 --> 02:40:21,600
points that could have marked the firm end of Frenemies,

2724
02:40:21,600 --> 02:40:23,600
but I think Ethan's tepid response to

2725
02:40:23,600 --> 02:40:25,600
Trisha's apology indicated the return

2726
02:40:25,600 --> 02:40:27,600
of the podcast was beyond hope.

2727
02:40:27,600 --> 02:40:29,600
I think Ethan had come to terms with this end

2728
02:40:29,600 --> 02:40:31,600
not too long after Trisha had announced they were

2729
02:40:31,600 --> 02:40:33,600
stepping down, and this was his ultimatum

2730
02:40:33,600 --> 02:40:35,600
to Trisha to accept it as well.

2731
02:40:35,600 --> 02:40:37,600
How would they move forward from this?

2732
02:40:37,600 --> 02:40:39,600
Well, sometimes Frenemy ships

2733
02:40:39,600 --> 02:40:41,600
aren't built to last.

2734
02:40:49,600 --> 02:40:51,600
Ethan addressed Trisha's apology one more time

2735
02:40:51,600 --> 02:40:53,600
in a segment on Off The Rails. In this, he echoed

2736
02:40:53,600 --> 02:40:55,600
many of the sentiments that he had expressed on Twitter

2737
02:40:55,600 --> 02:40:57,600
in a much more discernible tone of frustrated

2738
02:40:57,600 --> 02:40:59,600
exasperation, asserting that although

2739
02:40:59,600 --> 02:41:01,600
he wasn't opposed to an eventual reconciliation,

2740
02:41:01,600 --> 02:41:03,600
he wasn't prepared to forgive so quickly

2741
02:41:03,600 --> 02:41:05,600
and needed time. He also wasn't prepared

2742
02:41:05,600 --> 02:41:07,600
to let someone like Trisha close again,

2743
02:41:07,600 --> 02:41:09,600
when that in mind was not interested in reviving

2744
02:41:09,600 --> 02:41:11,600
the podcast, yet this was far

2745
02:41:11,600 --> 02:41:13,600
from the end.

2746
02:41:37,600 --> 02:41:39,600
Trisha was saying everything she could

2747
02:41:39,600 --> 02:41:41,600
to attack me personally, to attack

2748
02:41:41,600 --> 02:41:43,600
the business. If this is an apology

2749
02:41:43,600 --> 02:41:45,600
to me, why do I have to watch it on her

2750
02:41:45,600 --> 02:41:47,600
YouTube channel with 10 mid-rolls?

2751
02:41:47,600 --> 02:41:49,600
A phone call would have been nice. She has my

2752
02:41:49,600 --> 02:41:51,600
number, she knows that I'm open to talk

2753
02:41:51,600 --> 02:41:53,600
anytime, she missed, you know what I mean?

2754
02:41:53,600 --> 02:41:55,600
And she apologized to the crew, she said

2755
02:41:55,600 --> 02:41:57,600
previously she doesn't have any of the crew's contact

2756
02:41:57,600 --> 02:41:59,600
information, I'm sorry, but that's not true.

2757
02:41:59,600 --> 02:42:01,600
We're all in a group chat on WhatsApp,

2758
02:42:01,600 --> 02:42:03,600
she has everybody's phone number.

2759
02:42:03,600 --> 02:42:05,600
Around a week and a half after, Trisha uploaded a video

2760
02:42:05,600 --> 02:42:07,600
claiming there was an unaired episode of

2761
02:42:07,600 --> 02:42:09,600
Friendemies which featured a greater reconciliation

2762
02:42:09,600 --> 02:42:11,600
between the two parties, including an

2763
02:42:11,600 --> 02:42:13,600
apology from Ethan. You may seem to believe

2764
02:42:13,600 --> 02:42:15,600
this was filmed to promote their post-breakup merchandise

2765
02:42:15,600 --> 02:42:17,600
release that was being dropped around the same time.

2766
02:42:17,600 --> 02:42:19,600
However, after the merch sold out nearly

2767
02:42:19,600 --> 02:42:21,600
instantaneously, the motive to upload the

2768
02:42:21,600 --> 02:42:23,600
video was assumedly diminished.

2769
02:42:23,600 --> 02:42:25,600
After Trisha's video covering this, many podcast

2770
02:42:25,600 --> 02:42:27,600
fans requested that Ethan not upload

2771
02:42:27,600 --> 02:42:29,600
the video as they didn't want the drama prolonged,

2772
02:42:29,600 --> 02:42:31,600
and the episode, whatever its contents,

2773
02:42:31,600 --> 02:42:33,600
was never released. Following this,

2774
02:42:33,600 --> 02:42:35,600
there was a moment of respite, as it seemed

2775
02:42:35,600 --> 02:42:37,600
that both had just grown apart, and even

2776
02:42:37,600 --> 02:42:39,600
if reconciliation wasn't possible, the

2777
02:42:39,600 --> 02:42:41,600
absence of conflict was a welcome break for most

2778
02:42:41,600 --> 02:42:43,600
viewers. However, it always felt like a ceasefire

2779
02:42:43,600 --> 02:42:45,600
as opposed to a peace treaty, mainly

2780
02:42:45,600 --> 02:42:47,600
due to this suggested rapprochement on

2781
02:42:47,600 --> 02:42:49,600
Trisha's video. It's very hard for me to speculate

2782
02:42:49,600 --> 02:42:51,600
on what may or may not have been said,

2783
02:42:51,600 --> 02:42:53,600
because the only source is Trisha, and they do

2784
02:42:53,600 --> 02:42:55,600
have their biases, but if this video

2785
02:42:55,600 --> 02:42:57,600
marked some sort of understanding between the

2786
02:42:57,600 --> 02:42:59,600
two, then it wasn't to be recognized by

2787
02:42:59,600 --> 02:43:01,600
anyone outside, and in future videos

2788
02:43:01,600 --> 02:43:03,600
the underlying message was that there was still

2789
02:43:03,600 --> 02:43:05,600
unresolved tension.

2790
02:43:25,600 --> 02:43:27,600
For a while this seemed like Trisha's angle,

2791
02:43:27,600 --> 02:43:29,600
and maybe if this philosophy had sustained itself,

2792
02:43:29,600 --> 02:43:31,600
an eventual modification would have been

2793
02:43:31,600 --> 02:43:33,600
reached, but unfortunately this was not

2794
02:43:33,600 --> 02:43:35,600
the case. As I noted earlier, regardless

2795
02:43:35,600 --> 02:43:37,600
of what you think of the apology, it felt more

2796
02:43:37,600 --> 02:43:39,600
like another momentary decision rather than

2797
02:43:39,600 --> 02:43:41,600
a concrete resolution. For many people,

2798
02:43:41,600 --> 02:43:43,600
an apology normally marks the end of something,

2799
02:43:43,600 --> 02:43:45,600
a concession that you'd be foolish

2800
02:43:45,600 --> 02:43:47,600
to walk back on. At the same time,

2801
02:43:47,600 --> 02:43:49,600
sometimes as people feel they've been manipulated into

2802
02:43:49,600 --> 02:43:51,600
making a confession, they may retract it,

2803
02:43:51,600 --> 02:43:53,600
and as time transpired, Trisha seemed

2804
02:43:53,600 --> 02:43:55,600
to walk back their narrative once more,

2805
02:43:55,600 --> 02:43:57,600
slowly returning to their former position,

2806
02:43:57,600 --> 02:43:59,600
that they really had done nothing wrong, and

2807
02:43:59,600 --> 02:44:01,600
that responsibility primarily lay with Ethan.

2808
02:44:19,600 --> 02:44:21,600
It felt like the situation ultimately wasn't resolved,

2809
02:44:21,600 --> 02:44:23,600
Trisha felt inclined to continuously make these

2810
02:44:23,600 --> 02:44:25,600
statements to try and keep it alive, while making

2811
02:44:25,600 --> 02:44:27,600
it look like they weren't necessarily going

2812
02:44:27,600 --> 02:44:29,600
out of their way to talk about it, coincidentally

2813
02:44:29,600 --> 02:44:31,600
appearing on these podcasts who just seem

2814
02:44:31,600 --> 02:44:33,600
to be interested in discussing the latest

2815
02:44:33,600 --> 02:44:35,600
tea. Throughout all this, Ethan really

2816
02:44:35,600 --> 02:44:37,600
didn't say much, and whether that influenced

2817
02:44:37,600 --> 02:44:39,600
Trisha's next move is your judgement to make.

2818
02:44:39,600 --> 02:44:41,600
What move was that, I hear you ask?

2819
02:44:41,600 --> 02:44:43,600
Well, as I mentioned

2820
02:44:43,600 --> 02:44:45,600
a while back, Ethan's often quite

2821
02:44:45,600 --> 02:44:47,600
vocal with who he despises,

2822
02:44:47,600 --> 02:44:49,600
and one person who definitely fits that bill is

2823
02:44:49,600 --> 02:44:51,600
Keemstar, who Ethan has waged war against for

2824
02:44:51,600 --> 02:44:53,600
a good few years. Trisha in many ways

2825
02:44:53,600 --> 02:44:55,600
also seemed to be vocally critical

2826
02:44:55,600 --> 02:44:57,600
of Keemstar, attacking him for a variety

2827
02:44:57,600 --> 02:44:59,600
of reasons over the years, but if Trisha's

2828
02:44:59,600 --> 02:45:01,600
relationship with Ethan taught us anything

2829
02:45:01,600 --> 02:45:03,600
is that Trisha's sentiments can be known to

2830
02:45:03,600 --> 02:45:05,600
fluctuate a little. At that time, Keemstar

2831
02:45:05,600 --> 02:45:07,600
had found himself in some controversy due to

2832
02:45:07,600 --> 02:45:09,600
the age gap in his relationship with a

2833
02:45:09,600 --> 02:45:11,600
20-year-old female. At the same time, both

2834
02:45:11,600 --> 02:45:13,600
Ethan and Trisha had separately taken to YouTube

2835
02:45:13,600 --> 02:45:15,600
to criticise him, Ethan on his After

2836
02:45:15,600 --> 02:45:17,600
Dark podcast, and Trisha on their third

2837
02:45:17,600 --> 02:45:18,600
episode of Enemies.

2838
02:45:18,600 --> 02:45:20,600
And she doesn't know that I played

2839
02:45:20,600 --> 02:45:22,600
bad guy Keem online. Okay, if you're

2840
02:45:22,600 --> 02:45:24,600
bad guy Keem online and that's a character you're

2841
02:45:24,600 --> 02:45:26,600
playing, Daniel Keem, then you're an actual

2842
02:45:26,600 --> 02:45:28,600
creep in real life, like you are actually

2843
02:45:28,600 --> 02:45:30,600
a real-life perv, a real-life

2844
02:45:30,600 --> 02:45:32,600
just creep, just evil, just nasty,

2845
02:45:32,600 --> 02:45:34,600
just a nasty old man that's like

2846
02:45:34,600 --> 02:45:36,600
hurting this girl in ways that she may

2847
02:45:36,600 --> 02:45:38,600
not know, but you know,

2848
02:45:38,600 --> 02:45:40,600
you know, because I know he knows because

2849
02:45:40,600 --> 02:45:42,600
he's constantly bringing up things people are gonna

2850
02:45:42,600 --> 02:45:44,600
say, the power play, the this, but she's not

2851
02:45:44,600 --> 02:45:46,600
a fan. Trying to rationalise it on

2852
02:45:46,600 --> 02:45:48,600
this show, on Spotify, on his podcast

2853
02:45:48,600 --> 02:45:50,600
is like mind-blowing

2854
02:45:51,600 --> 02:45:53,600
Keemstar played this off with the usual

2855
02:45:53,600 --> 02:45:55,600
bombast that many expected from him, leaning

2856
02:45:55,600 --> 02:45:57,600
into the stereotype rather than running away

2857
02:45:57,600 --> 02:45:59,600
from it, if anything it showed that neither side

2858
02:45:59,600 --> 02:46:01,600
was willing to yield, yet for some fans it may have

2859
02:46:01,600 --> 02:46:03,600
been refreshing that Ethan and Trisha finally agreed

2860
02:46:03,600 --> 02:46:05,600
on something once more, but this moment of blissful

2861
02:46:05,600 --> 02:46:07,600
harmony was short-lived, as less than a week

2862
02:46:07,600 --> 02:46:09,600
after this Keemstar tweeted a picture of him

2863
02:46:09,600 --> 02:46:11,600
with FaZe Banks alongside, lo and behold,

2864
02:46:11,600 --> 02:46:13,600
Trisha Paytas, all looking

2865
02:46:13,600 --> 02:46:15,600
rather pleased with themselves, I wonder

2866
02:46:15,600 --> 02:46:17,600
why. This of course provoked a response

2867
02:46:17,600 --> 02:46:19,600
from Ethan who expressed disappointment of Trisha's

2868
02:46:19,600 --> 02:46:21,600
newfound allegiance, Trisha responded

2869
02:46:21,600 --> 02:46:23,600
over a variety of mediums, but we're gonna skip

2870
02:46:23,600 --> 02:46:25,600
over those for now. However, what would

2871
02:46:25,600 --> 02:46:27,600
the podcast actually be about?

2872
02:46:27,600 --> 02:46:29,600
After all, you can't just judge a book by

2873
02:46:29,600 --> 02:46:31,600
its cover, and Trish requested that everyone

2874
02:46:31,600 --> 02:46:33,600
give the episode a chance.

2875
02:46:49,600 --> 02:46:55,600
In the podcast,

2876
02:46:55,600 --> 02:46:57,600
Keemstar explains how it reached out to Trisha

2877
02:46:57,600 --> 02:46:59,600
offering a truce, and Trisha had agreed.

2878
02:46:59,600 --> 02:47:01,600
Trisha is fast to clarify that they're not

2879
02:47:01,600 --> 02:47:03,600
necessarily befriending Keemstar, and they're

2880
02:47:03,600 --> 02:47:05,600
actually still more pro-Ethan than pro-Keem,

2881
02:47:05,600 --> 02:47:07,600
though they definitely don't hold back in

2882
02:47:07,600 --> 02:47:09,600
analysing Ethan's behaviour over the previous

2883
02:47:09,600 --> 02:47:11,600
months.

2884
02:47:19,600 --> 02:47:21,600
Like, never aired, right?

2885
02:47:21,600 --> 02:47:23,600
Can I say that publicly?

2886
02:47:23,600 --> 02:47:25,600
There's an unaired last episode?

2887
02:47:25,600 --> 02:47:27,600
Yeah, we shot

2888
02:47:27,600 --> 02:47:29,600
one more for closure, and it was really

2889
02:47:29,600 --> 02:47:31,600
good, because I do feel

2890
02:47:31,600 --> 02:47:33,600
like I'd fucked up a lot, but it was the first

2891
02:47:33,600 --> 02:47:35,600
time Ethan admitted to screenshotting

2892
02:47:35,600 --> 02:47:37,600
my text, and I was like, oh perfect, this

2893
02:47:37,600 --> 02:47:39,600
will give me some redeeming qualities, because

2894
02:47:39,600 --> 02:47:41,600
he admitted in that that I never said fire to the crew, and I was like, perfect,

2895
02:47:41,600 --> 02:47:43,600
people are gonna know, they're gonna stop hating on me.

2896
02:47:43,600 --> 02:47:45,600
But then, yeah, he didn't post it, because he's like,

2897
02:47:45,600 --> 02:47:47,600
well, I don't want more hate to the crew, and it's gonna

2898
02:47:47,600 --> 02:47:49,600
pass out this person, and I was just like,

2899
02:47:49,600 --> 02:47:51,600
you posted all my breakdowns, but you're not gonna post this one

2900
02:47:51,600 --> 02:47:53,600
where I kinda look like, at least we're

2901
02:47:53,600 --> 02:47:55,600
balanced in being in the wrong, yeah.

2902
02:47:55,600 --> 02:47:57,600
So I have a little animosity towards him, like, I still

2903
02:47:57,600 --> 02:47:59,600
obviously love Ethan, but I do

2904
02:47:59,600 --> 02:48:01,600
have a little bit of that, I get what you're saying.

2905
02:48:01,600 --> 02:48:03,600
I think being sat down with two people who have a history

2906
02:48:03,600 --> 02:48:05,600
of conflict with Ethan kind of draws Trisha into this

2907
02:48:05,600 --> 02:48:07,600
discussion about him more than they probably

2908
02:48:07,600 --> 02:48:09,600
plan to be. The conversation isn't just about

2909
02:48:09,600 --> 02:48:11,600
Ethan, but it regularly returns to him.

2910
02:48:11,600 --> 02:48:13,600
Keemstar driving home the point that in his opinion,

2911
02:48:13,600 --> 02:48:15,600
Ethan is a moral weatherbane, and

2912
02:48:15,600 --> 02:48:17,600
sends the popular opinions to garner a social

2913
02:48:17,600 --> 02:48:19,600
advantage, while receiving special treatment

2914
02:48:19,600 --> 02:48:21,600
from YouTube. Trisha often plays off this

2915
02:48:21,600 --> 02:48:23,600
narrative with their own personal experiences,

2916
02:48:23,600 --> 02:48:25,600
talking about many of the previous incidents that still

2917
02:48:25,600 --> 02:48:27,600
seem unresolved to them.

2918
02:48:27,600 --> 02:48:29,600
He's a walking, talking hypocrite.

2919
02:48:29,600 --> 02:48:31,600
Oh, for sure, I don't think there's anything wrong with that,

2920
02:48:31,600 --> 02:48:33,600
because I'm also a walking, talking hypocrite.

2921
02:48:33,600 --> 02:48:35,600
I think, again, it's just the lack of, like, admitting

2922
02:48:35,600 --> 02:48:37,600
that, like, I feel like if you could admit it,

2923
02:48:37,600 --> 02:48:39,600
because I, 100%, like, even me sitting here,

2924
02:48:39,600 --> 02:48:41,600
people are like, she's so hypocritical, whatever, you know what I mean?

2925
02:48:41,600 --> 02:48:43,600
But I don't think it is that either, I honestly think

2926
02:48:43,600 --> 02:48:45,600
it's just, like, having a discussion, but...

2927
02:49:13,600 --> 02:49:15,600
I mean, I think it's, like, gross when people do make fun

2928
02:49:15,600 --> 02:49:17,600
of people's, like, looks, or small penises, or whatever.

2929
02:49:17,600 --> 02:49:19,600
I don't like when people make fun

2930
02:49:19,600 --> 02:49:21,600
of people's, like, aesthetic, but I'm telling you

2931
02:49:21,600 --> 02:49:23,600
that's how me and Ethan first met, he made a whole video

2932
02:49:23,600 --> 02:49:25,600
calling me, like, a whale, like, a corpse,

2933
02:49:25,600 --> 02:49:27,600
like, all this stuff, saying how, like, I photoshopped my pictures,

2934
02:49:27,600 --> 02:49:29,600
so, like, he did the same thing to me, so it is

2935
02:49:29,600 --> 02:49:31,600
a little hypocritical, but I do think it, I mean,

2936
02:49:31,600 --> 02:49:33,600
that was... It was ironic that this was

2937
02:49:33,600 --> 02:49:35,600
approximately a year after Keem had offered a truce

2938
02:49:35,600 --> 02:49:37,600
to Ethan, who started framing me shortly after.

2939
02:49:37,600 --> 02:49:39,600
This time, it was Keem's turn to platform

2940
02:49:39,600 --> 02:49:41,600
Trisha, though. It seems that Keem had worked

2941
02:49:41,600 --> 02:49:43,600
out that although Trisha talked to Big Game,

2942
02:49:43,600 --> 02:49:45,600
they were regularly swayed, and in this case

2943
02:49:45,600 --> 02:49:47,600
it worked out almost exactly as

2944
02:49:47,600 --> 02:49:49,600
envisioned, well, for Keem at least.

2945
02:49:49,600 --> 02:49:51,600
This wasn't out of the ordinary for Trisha,

2946
02:49:51,600 --> 02:49:53,600
they're known to go on podcasts for people they have

2947
02:49:53,600 --> 02:49:55,600
grievances with, that's why they appeared on the H3 podcast

2948
02:49:55,600 --> 02:49:57,600
in the first place. However, given how the

2949
02:49:57,600 --> 02:49:59,600
discussion does tend to pivot towards

2950
02:49:59,600 --> 02:50:01,600
Ethan, and given how Ethan doesn't quite

2951
02:50:01,600 --> 02:50:03,600
share the same philosophy, people weren't

2952
02:50:03,600 --> 02:50:05,600
entirely happy, and neither

2953
02:50:05,600 --> 02:50:07,600
was Ethan.

2954
02:50:11,600 --> 02:50:13,600
In

2955
02:50:13,600 --> 02:50:15,600
this situation, even the

2956
02:50:15,600 --> 02:50:17,600
photo of Trisha with Keemstar had provoked

2957
02:50:17,600 --> 02:50:19,600
a bit of uproar from the Clines, however, there was

2958
02:50:19,600 --> 02:50:21,600
also a bit more context that makes the

2959
02:50:21,600 --> 02:50:23,600
circumstances more primed for hostility.

2960
02:50:23,600 --> 02:50:25,600
The girl is not to blame for

2961
02:50:25,600 --> 02:50:27,600
anything. The girl is

2962
02:50:27,600 --> 02:50:29,600
only 20 years old, she's a child,

2963
02:50:29,600 --> 02:50:31,600
we love, I mean, well, I don't know anything about

2964
02:50:31,600 --> 02:50:33,600
her, but I'm not going after her at all, I was never gonna

2965
02:50:33,600 --> 02:50:35,600
criticise her or say anything bad about her,

2966
02:50:35,600 --> 02:50:37,600
this is just about a 39 year old creep

2967
02:50:37,600 --> 02:50:39,600
preying on a young girl.

2968
02:50:39,600 --> 02:50:41,600
In the video covering Keemstar's new girlfriend,

2969
02:50:41,600 --> 02:50:43,600
Ethan included a segment which

2970
02:50:43,600 --> 02:50:45,600
entailed an individual calling in and claiming

2971
02:50:45,600 --> 02:50:47,600
to be this lady, and going into rather explicit

2972
02:50:47,600 --> 02:50:49,600
detail about the relationship.

2973
02:50:49,600 --> 02:50:51,600
Keemstar felt that there was a double standard being

2974
02:50:51,600 --> 02:50:53,600
operated here, and tweeted a video tagging

2975
02:50:53,600 --> 02:50:55,600
Team YouTube and talking about the situation

2976
02:50:55,600 --> 02:50:57,600
at hand.

2977
02:51:09,600 --> 02:51:11,600
The emails here threatening me that that's

2978
02:51:11,600 --> 02:51:13,600
gonna happen, can't do creator on creator

2979
02:51:13,600 --> 02:51:15,600
harassment, but Ethan Cline

2980
02:51:15,600 --> 02:51:17,600
has made about 50 fucking

2981
02:51:17,600 --> 02:51:19,600
videos breaking

2982
02:51:19,600 --> 02:51:21,600
TOS, breaking the bullying and harassment

2983
02:51:21,600 --> 02:51:23,600
thing, he uploaded a fucking

2984
02:51:23,600 --> 02:51:25,600
video of a Keemstar puppet and he's like

2985
02:51:25,600 --> 02:51:27,600
fucking it, how is that not

2986
02:51:27,600 --> 02:51:29,600
breaking YouTube TOS,

2987
02:51:29,600 --> 02:51:31,600
how is that not breaking the bullying and

2988
02:51:31,600 --> 02:51:33,600
harassment thing, now he uploads this video

2989
02:51:33,600 --> 02:51:35,600
with someone that's supposed to be my new girlfriend,

2990
02:51:35,600 --> 02:51:37,600
it's like a fake person calling

2991
02:51:37,600 --> 02:51:39,600
in, and they're like, yeah Keem's got a

2992
02:51:39,600 --> 02:51:41,600
little dick, Keem's dick doesn't

2993
02:51:41,600 --> 02:51:43,600
work, and am I over here crying

2994
02:51:43,600 --> 02:51:45,600
about it? Absolutely not.

2995
02:51:45,600 --> 02:51:47,600
But let me talk shit back.

2996
02:51:47,600 --> 02:51:49,600
I really wanna fucking know

2997
02:51:49,600 --> 02:51:51,600
Susan, Team YouTube,

2998
02:51:51,600 --> 02:51:53,600
everybody at YouTube, why is it

2999
02:51:53,600 --> 02:51:55,600
Keemstar versus H3H3,

3000
02:51:55,600 --> 02:51:57,600
I have sent emails

3001
02:51:57,600 --> 02:51:59,600
when he broke TOS saying, hey look

3002
02:51:59,600 --> 02:52:01,600
he's doing the same thing that you threatened to kick me

3003
02:52:01,600 --> 02:52:03,600
out of the partnership program, and it gets

3004
02:52:03,600 --> 02:52:05,600
ignored. Explain the blatant

3005
02:52:05,600 --> 02:52:07,600
fucking bias, because all

3006
02:52:07,600 --> 02:52:09,600
these fucking YouTubers, David Dobrik,

3007
02:52:09,600 --> 02:52:11,600
everyone else has dealt with this bullshit

3008
02:52:11,600 --> 02:52:13,600
with Ethan Klein, why is it other

3009
02:52:13,600 --> 02:52:15,600
YouTubers versus Ethan Klein

3010
02:52:15,600 --> 02:52:17,600
and YouTube staff, please explain

3011
02:52:17,600 --> 02:52:19,600
it to all of us right now,

3012
02:52:19,600 --> 02:52:21,600
why he's getting special privileges.

3013
02:52:21,600 --> 02:52:23,600
Not too long after this, the H3 After

3014
02:52:23,600 --> 02:52:25,600
Dark video on the matter was removed for violating

3015
02:52:25,600 --> 02:52:27,600
YouTube's TOS, with many assuming

3016
02:52:27,600 --> 02:52:29,600
that Keemstar played a hand in this.

3017
02:52:29,600 --> 02:52:31,600
Though he denied direct involvement in the removal

3018
02:52:31,600 --> 02:52:33,600
of the video, it was hard to completely buy

3019
02:52:33,600 --> 02:52:35,600
this idea that his vocal outcries hadn't

3020
02:52:35,600 --> 02:52:37,600
influenced YouTube in some sort of way,

3021
02:52:37,600 --> 02:52:39,600
with many requesting to see his flag history.

3022
02:52:39,600 --> 02:52:41,600
For someone like Ethan, who already vehemently loathes

3023
02:52:41,600 --> 02:52:43,600
Keemstar, there was no two ways about

3024
02:52:43,600 --> 02:52:45,600
it. Keemstar had committed an attack on the podcast,

3025
02:52:45,600 --> 02:52:47,600
and a form of friends alliance at a time

3026
02:52:47,600 --> 02:52:49,600
of heightened conflict was a stonewall

3027
02:52:49,600 --> 02:52:51,600
betrayal. With this in mind, in his first

3028
02:52:51,600 --> 02:52:53,600
H3 Off the Rails back, Ethan decides

3029
02:52:53,600 --> 02:52:55,600
to address Trisha Paytas one last

3030
02:52:55,600 --> 02:52:56,600
time.

3031
02:52:56,600 --> 02:52:58,600
So basically what this is to me,

3032
02:52:58,600 --> 02:53:00,600
she is uh,

3033
02:53:00,600 --> 02:53:02,600
what's the name of that famous turncoat

3034
02:53:02,600 --> 02:53:04,600
during the revolutionary Benedict

3035
02:53:04,600 --> 02:53:06,600
Benedict Arnold? Yeah, she Benedict

3036
02:53:06,600 --> 02:53:08,600
Arnold'd me big time.

3037
02:53:08,600 --> 02:53:10,600
This is an unforgivable

3038
02:53:10,600 --> 02:53:12,600
traitorous act. And I'm going to explain

3039
02:53:12,600 --> 02:53:14,600
in great detail why.

3040
02:53:14,600 --> 02:53:16,600
And I'm going to be totally honest with you guys,

3041
02:53:16,600 --> 02:53:18,600
a part of me wanted to take the high road

3042
02:53:18,600 --> 02:53:20,600
on this and just ignore it.

3043
02:53:20,600 --> 02:53:22,600
Uh, but at the same time, I'm

3044
02:53:22,600 --> 02:53:24,600
so sick of her disrespecting

3045
02:53:24,600 --> 02:53:26,600
me, and my family,

3046
02:53:26,600 --> 02:53:28,600
and causing shit,

3047
02:53:28,600 --> 02:53:30,600
and just being so toxic, lying,

3048
02:53:30,600 --> 02:53:32,600
and I'm just so

3049
02:53:32,600 --> 02:53:34,600
freaking over her.

3050
02:53:34,600 --> 02:53:36,600
Now as I've noted, it's not exactly

3051
02:53:36,600 --> 02:53:38,600
surprising taking a perfunctory look

3052
02:53:38,600 --> 02:53:40,600
at Trisha's history. They wanted to go on

3053
02:53:40,600 --> 02:53:42,600
Keem's podcast, though Ethan certainly compiles

3054
02:53:42,600 --> 02:53:44,600
a fair assembly of clips that make even

3055
02:53:44,600 --> 02:53:46,600
this decision look a bit inconsistent

3056
02:53:46,600 --> 02:53:48,600
on Trisha's part, especially given

3057
02:53:48,600 --> 02:53:50,600
their familial relation, throwing some shade

3058
02:53:50,600 --> 02:53:52,600
towards Moses as well. Trisha's even

3059
02:53:52,600 --> 02:53:54,600
gone on podcast with Gabbie Hanna previously,

3060
02:53:54,600 --> 02:53:56,600
so it's clear that they're not entirely hostile

3061
02:53:56,600 --> 02:53:58,600
to anyone. But in a way, although it makes

3062
02:53:58,600 --> 02:54:00,600
sense that Trisha would do this, the question

3063
02:54:00,600 --> 02:54:02,600
Ethan wants to ask is, should she?

3064
02:54:28,600 --> 02:54:30,600
Can this story get blown out of proportion?

3065
02:54:30,600 --> 02:54:32,600
Girl, what?

3066
02:54:58,600 --> 02:55:00,600
serious, serious help. So don't even think

3067
02:55:00,600 --> 02:55:02,600
for a second that you're trolling, or ruining, or

3068
02:55:02,600 --> 02:55:04,600
anyone thinks around it.

3069
02:55:04,600 --> 02:55:06,600
So she has that much energy

3070
02:55:06,600 --> 02:55:08,600
for our word apologist,

3071
02:55:08,600 --> 02:55:10,600
but keep the same energy

3072
02:55:10,600 --> 02:55:12,600
because, um,

3073
02:55:12,600 --> 02:55:14,600
Keemstar,

3074
02:55:14,600 --> 02:55:16,600
on the same exact situation,

3075
02:55:16,600 --> 02:55:18,600
said way worse things, and if you care

3076
02:55:18,600 --> 02:55:20,600
about Jessie Smiles, she

3077
02:55:20,600 --> 02:55:22,600
seemed to have been way more

3078
02:55:22,600 --> 02:55:24,600
offended by what Keemstar said than

3079
02:55:24,600 --> 02:55:26,600
Gabbie, of the

3080
02:55:26,600 --> 02:55:28,600
protecting.

3081
02:55:28,600 --> 02:55:30,600
You have handled this situation with such poor taste.

3082
02:55:30,600 --> 02:55:32,600
You're right, you don't know what happened.

3083
02:55:32,600 --> 02:55:34,600
But you sure felt like you did all these years

3084
02:55:34,600 --> 02:55:36,600
when you consistently called me a liar,

3085
02:55:36,600 --> 02:55:38,600
mocked my accusations. Sorry

3086
02:55:38,600 --> 02:55:40,600
you hate all these r-word cases. By the way,

3087
02:55:40,600 --> 02:55:42,600
must be hard on you. And she included

3088
02:55:42,600 --> 02:55:44,600
a screenshot of Keemstar saying, sorry,

3089
02:55:44,600 --> 02:55:46,600
Jessie Smiles tagged her on

3090
02:55:46,600 --> 02:55:48,600
Twitter, only has 140

3091
02:55:48,600 --> 02:55:50,600
characters. Please don't accuse me

3092
02:55:50,600 --> 02:55:52,600
of r-word. He's making a joke out of it.

3093
02:55:52,600 --> 02:55:54,600
Basically accusing her of making

3094
02:55:54,600 --> 02:55:56,600
false allegations.

3095
02:55:56,600 --> 02:55:58,600
This is just one specific

3096
02:55:58,600 --> 02:56:00,600
example of Keemstar's

3097
02:56:00,600 --> 02:56:02,600
continued

3098
02:56:04,600 --> 02:56:06,600
history of

3099
02:56:06,600 --> 02:56:08,600
not believing victims.

3100
02:56:08,600 --> 02:56:10,600
In part, he does respond to the

3101
02:56:10,600 --> 02:56:12,600
narratives espoused throughout the podcast,

3102
02:56:12,600 --> 02:56:14,600
but more tries take a holistic standpoint that this

3103
02:56:14,600 --> 02:56:16,600
is Keemstar taking advantage of Trisha

3104
02:56:16,600 --> 02:56:18,600
for his own gain, showing a variety of tweets

3105
02:56:18,600 --> 02:56:20,600
and clips that seem to imply that Keemstar is

3106
02:56:20,600 --> 02:56:22,600
enjoying the situation much more than anyone

3107
02:56:22,600 --> 02:56:24,600
else's. Even supposedly inviting

3108
02:56:24,600 --> 02:56:26,600
Gabbie Hanna on the same day they were hosting

3109
02:56:26,600 --> 02:56:28,600
Trisha and joking about it with FaZe Banks

3110
02:56:28,600 --> 02:56:30,600
on the podcast.

3111
02:56:52,600 --> 02:56:54,600
Jorts on.

3112
02:56:54,600 --> 02:56:56,600
Legends. Legend.

3113
02:56:56,600 --> 02:56:58,600
Here, now, again, she's

3114
02:56:58,600 --> 02:57:00,600
a free speech advocate all the sudden

3115
02:57:00,600 --> 02:57:02,600
and she believes in

3116
02:57:02,600 --> 02:57:04,600
talking to anyone about anything, right?

3117
02:57:04,600 --> 02:57:06,600
So here is, here they, they're kind

3118
02:57:06,600 --> 02:57:08,600
of teasing her a little bit. They're kind of making a fool

3119
02:57:08,600 --> 02:57:10,600
out of her. Listen to this.

3120
02:57:10,600 --> 02:57:12,600
He was here. Imagine- I swear I thought you were gonna do that.

3121
02:57:12,600 --> 02:57:14,600
No, but listen, listen. Imagine if Gabbie was here

3122
02:57:14,600 --> 02:57:16,600
and we posted a picture, FaZe Banks

3123
02:57:16,600 --> 02:57:18,600
Keemstar, Trisha, Gabbie.

3124
02:57:18,600 --> 02:57:20,600
I'd bolt.

3125
02:57:20,600 --> 02:57:22,600
She'd bolt.

3126
02:57:22,600 --> 02:57:24,600
She's there. Gabbie's there.

3127
02:57:24,600 --> 02:57:26,600
Or at least she's on her way there.

3128
02:57:26,600 --> 02:57:28,600
So Keemstar starts being like, can you imagine

3129
02:57:28,600 --> 02:57:30,600
if Gabbie was here?

3130
02:57:30,600 --> 02:57:32,600
She's testing the water a little bit.

3131
02:57:32,600 --> 02:57:34,600
I'd bolt.

3132
02:57:34,600 --> 02:57:36,600
Interesting.

3133
02:57:36,600 --> 02:57:38,600
I wouldn't do that to you.

3134
02:57:38,600 --> 02:57:40,600
I wouldn't do that to you.

3135
02:57:40,600 --> 02:57:42,600
On the whole though, this video is designed to be the final nail

3136
02:57:42,600 --> 02:57:44,600
in the coffin for Ethan and Trisha's working

3137
02:57:44,600 --> 02:57:46,600
relationship, and dare I say it, friendship.

3138
02:57:46,600 --> 02:57:48,600
Even goes on to discuss the unaired

3139
02:57:48,600 --> 02:57:50,600
episode which Trisha had been bringing up over the last

3140
02:57:50,600 --> 02:57:52,600
month, and explains that the reason it wasn't released

3141
02:57:52,600 --> 02:57:54,600
was because he didn't feel like it gave anyone

3142
02:57:54,600 --> 02:57:56,600
the closure Trisha claims it did, and it was actually

3143
02:57:56,600 --> 02:57:58,600
quite an uncomfortable recording which he rather

3144
02:57:58,600 --> 02:58:00,600
regrets. He also notes that Trisha

3145
02:58:00,600 --> 02:58:02,600
claims to have recorded the episode, and has been

3146
02:58:02,600 --> 02:58:04,600
alluding to it in the DMs, stating that he is

3147
02:58:04,600 --> 02:58:06,600
not fazed by the implication that they may release it.

3148
02:58:06,600 --> 02:58:08,600
How everything had gone

3149
02:58:08,600 --> 02:58:10,600
down, I was feeling bad about

3150
02:58:10,600 --> 02:58:12,600
the rift that it had caused

3151
02:58:12,600 --> 02:58:14,600
in the family and everything, and

3152
02:58:14,600 --> 02:58:16,600
I wanted to make amends,

3153
02:58:16,600 --> 02:58:18,600
and in my heart, I thought

3154
02:58:18,600 --> 02:58:20,600
what would be great is if we could just

3155
02:58:20,600 --> 02:58:22,600
come together for one final episode

3156
02:58:22,600 --> 02:58:24,600
for it to be wholesome,

3157
02:58:24,600 --> 02:58:26,600
for it to be just a beautiful experience

3158
02:58:26,600 --> 02:58:28,600
where we just reflect on the nice

3159
02:58:28,600 --> 02:58:30,600
experience we have and part ways

3160
02:58:30,600 --> 02:58:32,600
amicably. As soon as we sat

3161
02:58:32,600 --> 02:58:34,600
down, basically almost immediately

3162
02:58:34,600 --> 02:58:36,600
it just went sideways. It just went

3163
02:58:36,600 --> 02:58:38,600
off the rails,

3164
02:58:38,600 --> 02:58:40,600
it just turned into more accusations

3165
02:58:40,600 --> 02:58:42,600
and it just got really icky.

3166
02:58:42,600 --> 02:58:44,600
And I was like immediately

3167
02:58:44,600 --> 02:58:46,600
regretting it, because it was just

3168
02:58:46,600 --> 02:58:48,600
it was just

3169
02:58:48,600 --> 02:58:50,600
not at all what I wanted or expected.

3170
02:58:50,600 --> 02:58:52,600
This whole claim that like

3171
02:58:52,600 --> 02:58:54,600
I had never apologized to her, she keeps saying like

3172
02:58:54,600 --> 02:58:56,600
he apologized, I proved

3173
02:58:56,600 --> 02:58:58,600
that he, that the, that

3174
02:58:58,600 --> 02:59:00,600
I never said I wanted to fire the crew.

3175
02:59:00,600 --> 02:59:02,600
Um, you know, I admitted

3176
02:59:02,600 --> 02:59:04,600
in my first video, about

3177
02:59:04,600 --> 02:59:06,600
Trisha leaving for enemies, that I

3178
02:59:06,600 --> 02:59:08,600
messed up in showing the crew the text.

3179
02:59:08,600 --> 02:59:10,600
They secretly recorded us,

3180
02:59:10,600 --> 02:59:12,600
which was like

3181
02:59:12,600 --> 02:59:14,600
kind of devastating to me.

3182
02:59:14,600 --> 02:59:16,600
That they came into the house,

3183
02:59:16,600 --> 02:59:18,600
secretly

3184
02:59:18,600 --> 02:59:20,600
recorded our conversations

3185
02:59:20,600 --> 02:59:22,600
before and after the podcast

3186
02:59:22,600 --> 02:59:24,600
and during. The thing is I'm not

3187
02:59:24,600 --> 02:59:26,600
I don't care if they release it, so it's not like a

3188
02:59:26,600 --> 02:59:28,600
I think they think, I don't know why they

3189
02:59:28,600 --> 02:59:30,600
think it's such a big deal, it's just a messy

3190
02:59:30,600 --> 02:59:32,600
episode. But I

3191
02:59:32,600 --> 02:59:34,600
guess in their mind they think they've been

3192
02:59:34,600 --> 02:59:36,600
threatening us with like, well we recorded

3193
02:59:36,600 --> 02:59:38,600
it, here it is,

3194
02:59:38,600 --> 02:59:40,600
we're going to release it,

3195
02:59:40,600 --> 02:59:42,600
you know, I'm listening to it back, it's like

3196
02:59:42,600 --> 02:59:44,600
I just found that like

3197
02:59:44,600 --> 02:59:46,600
such a violation

3198
02:59:46,600 --> 02:59:48,600
to come into our house and secretly

3199
02:59:48,600 --> 02:59:50,600
record us. I was like, wow.

3200
02:59:50,600 --> 02:59:52,600
This may not be closure

3201
02:59:52,600 --> 02:59:54,600
per se, but it is the closest that people

3202
02:59:54,600 --> 02:59:56,600
were going to have. Two contrasting yet

3203
02:59:56,600 --> 02:59:58,600
affirmative perspectives. From this, people

3204
02:59:58,600 --> 03:00:00,600
could draw their own conclusions. However, beyond

3205
03:00:00,600 --> 03:00:02,600
the basic allegations of hypocrisy, there

3206
03:00:02,600 --> 03:00:04,600
was a more troubling allegation. Hypocrisy

3207
03:00:04,600 --> 03:00:06,600
is when you say something in the moment

3208
03:00:06,600 --> 03:00:08,600
and contradict that at a later time, and

3209
03:00:08,600 --> 03:00:10,600
although it can be problematic, it's not particularly

3210
03:00:10,600 --> 03:00:12,600
exceptional, especially in this industry,

3211
03:00:12,600 --> 03:00:14,600
particularly as you often can't decipher

3212
03:00:14,600 --> 03:00:16,600
intent. However, Ethan once more chose to

3213
03:00:16,600 --> 03:00:18,600
go in on Trisha, accusing them of lying over

3214
03:00:18,600 --> 03:00:20,600
a variety of issues relating to the podcast,

3215
03:00:20,600 --> 03:00:22,600
including statements they had made since.

3216
03:00:38,600 --> 03:00:40,600
Uh,

3217
03:00:40,600 --> 03:00:42,600
yeah.

3218
03:01:02,600 --> 03:01:04,600
Wait, how many followers

3219
03:01:04,600 --> 03:01:06,600
does this account have? Oh my god!

3220
03:01:08,600 --> 03:01:10,600
He also gave some attention to

3221
03:01:10,600 --> 03:01:12,600
accounts that seem dedicated to showing these rather

3222
03:01:12,600 --> 03:01:14,600
conscious contradictions, particularly

3223
03:01:14,600 --> 03:01:16,600
those on TikTok. He seems quite amused by

3224
03:01:16,600 --> 03:01:18,600
most of these clips, and although you can understand

3225
03:01:18,600 --> 03:01:20,600
why they would have irked him, often after the collapse

3226
03:01:20,600 --> 03:01:22,600
of a working relationship, you are prone

3227
03:01:22,600 --> 03:01:24,600
to trash talk your former colleague a little,

3228
03:01:24,600 --> 03:01:26,600
so these aren't exactly surprising.

3229
03:01:26,600 --> 03:01:28,600
However, there is one clip that he seems to take slightly

3230
03:01:28,600 --> 03:01:30,600
more seriously, relating to an anecdote

3231
03:01:30,600 --> 03:01:32,600
that Trisha shared while the podcast was still operating

3232
03:01:32,600 --> 03:01:34,600
fairly smoothly.

3233
03:01:38,600 --> 03:01:40,600
That actually

3234
03:01:40,600 --> 03:01:42,600
really disturbed me.

3235
03:02:08,600 --> 03:02:10,600
I wanted a Pomeranian for a long time.

3236
03:02:10,600 --> 03:02:12,600
Both me and my mom have wanted a puppy

3237
03:02:12,600 --> 03:02:14,600
for so long. I live alone.

3238
03:02:14,600 --> 03:02:16,600
My mom is alone.

3239
03:02:16,600 --> 03:02:18,600
Yeah, he's adorable.

3240
03:02:18,600 --> 03:02:20,600
This color is just perfect.

3241
03:02:20,600 --> 03:02:22,600
Everyone who meets him falls in love with him.

3242
03:02:22,600 --> 03:02:24,600
They just surprised me with it for our vlog and made me keep it.

3243
03:02:24,600 --> 03:02:26,600
We're gonna try and get some houses because we honestly want

3244
03:02:26,600 --> 03:02:28,600
more. We just love this little guy so,

3245
03:02:28,600 --> 03:02:30,600
so much. We just love him so much,

3246
03:02:30,600 --> 03:02:32,600
and hopefully that'll show in here.

3247
03:02:32,600 --> 03:02:34,600
We want two more. We want a little black one,

3248
03:02:34,600 --> 03:02:36,600
and possibly a white one.

3249
03:02:36,600 --> 03:02:38,600
I never asked for a dog. Oh my god, let's go get a dog.

3250
03:02:38,600 --> 03:02:40,600
You wanna go what? You wanna go buy a dog today?

3251
03:02:40,600 --> 03:02:42,600
I never asked for a dog. Can we get a dog? Oh my god.

3252
03:02:42,600 --> 03:02:44,600
My dog was because of David and Jason.

3253
03:02:44,600 --> 03:02:46,600
They just surprised me with it for our vlog and made me...

3254
03:02:46,600 --> 03:02:48,600
Dude, it's so disturbing

3255
03:02:48,600 --> 03:02:50,600
to me how she's openly lying.

3256
03:02:50,600 --> 03:02:52,600
In this clip, Trisha's prior behavior

3257
03:02:52,600 --> 03:02:54,600
appears to directly refute all available

3258
03:02:54,600 --> 03:02:56,600
testimony that they articulated

3259
03:02:56,600 --> 03:02:58,600
off enemies, leaving Ethan rather bemused,

3260
03:02:58,600 --> 03:03:00,600
and even concerned as to Trisha's capability

3261
03:03:00,600 --> 03:03:02,600
to expound mistruths.

3262
03:03:02,600 --> 03:03:04,600
So disturbing to me

3263
03:03:04,600 --> 03:03:06,600
how she's openly lying.

3264
03:03:06,600 --> 03:03:08,600
She really convinced me

3265
03:03:08,600 --> 03:03:10,600
of this dog lie.

3266
03:03:10,600 --> 03:03:12,600
And she really successfully

3267
03:03:12,600 --> 03:03:14,600
assassinated their character. Now, I mean

3268
03:03:14,600 --> 03:03:16,600
this specifically has me questioning

3269
03:03:16,600 --> 03:03:18,600
everything. And I

3270
03:03:18,600 --> 03:03:20,600
can't help but wonder if I've just been a

3271
03:03:20,600 --> 03:03:22,600
useful idiot to her this whole time.

3272
03:03:22,600 --> 03:03:24,600
And the essay allegation about Dom, like

3273
03:03:24,600 --> 03:03:26,600
all that stuff that was made publicly separate of her

3274
03:03:26,600 --> 03:03:28,600
is like, you know, 100%

3275
03:03:28,600 --> 03:03:30,600
believable. But like this dog thing

3276
03:03:30,600 --> 03:03:32,600
like, I just feel like I've been the useful

3277
03:03:32,600 --> 03:03:34,600
idiot to her the whole time to

3278
03:03:34,600 --> 03:03:36,600
smear these people that she hates, because

3279
03:03:36,600 --> 03:03:38,600
this is a flat out

3280
03:03:38,600 --> 03:03:40,600
horrific lie to

3281
03:03:40,600 --> 03:03:42,600
make about someone.

3282
03:03:42,600 --> 03:03:44,600
In a way, this was the only significant

3283
03:03:44,600 --> 03:03:46,600
development on the situation. Trisha's appearance

3284
03:03:46,600 --> 03:03:48,600
on Mum's basement didn't really change the

3285
03:03:48,600 --> 03:03:50,600
narratives too much. We knew what each party

3286
03:03:50,600 --> 03:03:52,600
would probably say. We know where these people

3287
03:03:52,600 --> 03:03:54,600
stand on each other. How this moment seemed to

3288
03:03:54,600 --> 03:03:56,600
at least prompt a brief reassessment of the

3289
03:03:56,600 --> 03:03:58,600
podcast by Ethan, and this reassessment

3290
03:03:58,600 --> 03:04:00,600
would only yield more questions in the coming

3291
03:04:00,600 --> 03:04:02,600
month. Trisha has commented on

3292
03:04:02,600 --> 03:04:04,600
countless issues, and shared many anecdotes

3293
03:04:04,600 --> 03:04:06,600
in extensive detail, often more detailed

3294
03:04:06,600 --> 03:04:08,600
than a majority of people would ever be expected

3295
03:04:08,600 --> 03:04:10,600
to recall. Some of these were related to

3296
03:04:10,600 --> 03:04:12,600
YouTube dramas like the David de Brix saga,

3297
03:04:12,600 --> 03:04:14,600
but there were also a lot of personal stories

3298
03:04:14,600 --> 03:04:16,600
which they opened up about, and as a person with

3299
03:04:16,600 --> 03:04:18,600
their own trauma, they would share some of these stories

3300
03:04:18,600 --> 03:04:20,600
to an often very sympathetic audience.

3301
03:04:20,600 --> 03:04:22,600
One of these stories that was particularly harrowing

3302
03:04:22,600 --> 03:04:24,600
was about a teacher who had violated them while

3303
03:04:24,600 --> 03:04:26,600
they were in school, an experience unfortunately

3304
03:04:26,600 --> 03:04:28,600
a lot more common than we'd like it to be.

3305
03:04:28,600 --> 03:04:30,600
At the time, it was a very powerful moment

3306
03:04:30,600 --> 03:04:32,600
on the podcast, and they had a set of people

3307
03:04:32,600 --> 03:04:34,600
surrounding them who were ready to support them.

3308
03:04:34,600 --> 03:04:36,600
However, with some questions beginning to

3309
03:04:36,600 --> 03:04:38,600
arise about Trisha's accuracy in delivering

3310
03:04:38,600 --> 03:04:40,600
information, a new light was shone

3311
03:04:40,600 --> 03:04:42,600
onto some of these allegations.

3312
03:04:51,600 --> 03:04:54,600
September 2021 was a rough month.

3313
03:04:54,600 --> 03:04:56,600
Trisha's decision to appear on mum's basement

3314
03:04:56,600 --> 03:04:58,600
had already put a further strain on the family

3315
03:04:58,600 --> 03:05:00,600
relationship, under burden from numerous

3316
03:05:00,600 --> 03:05:02,600
incidents, some of which were documented on the H3 podcast.

3317
03:05:22,600 --> 03:05:24,600
This had continuously manifested

3318
03:05:24,600 --> 03:05:26,600
with other family members involving themselves,

3319
03:05:26,600 --> 03:05:28,600
one of them being Moses Ackman,

3320
03:05:28,600 --> 03:05:30,600
the individual who served as the keystone in the

3321
03:05:30,600 --> 03:05:32,600
connection between the Klines and Patus.

3322
03:05:32,600 --> 03:05:34,600
He had recently become more vocal in his

3323
03:05:34,600 --> 03:05:36,600
participation after certain claims were made about

3324
03:05:36,600 --> 03:05:38,600
his conduct, defending himself while also

3325
03:05:38,600 --> 03:05:40,600
criticising Ethan for his behaviour.

3326
03:05:40,600 --> 03:05:42,600
As both parties stewed in the fallout of the latest

3327
03:05:42,600 --> 03:05:44,600
strife, questions were being raised about the story

3328
03:05:44,600 --> 03:05:46,600
that Trisha had told on episode 17,

3329
03:05:46,600 --> 03:05:48,600
the violation story.

3330
03:05:54,600 --> 03:06:12,600
One of the details

3331
03:06:12,600 --> 03:06:14,600
Trisha had divulged during this anecdote was that

3332
03:06:14,600 --> 03:06:16,600
this teacher was eventually arrested on charges

3333
03:06:16,600 --> 03:06:18,600
of CP. However, with some digging, certain

3334
03:06:18,600 --> 03:06:20,600
people began to uncover information that disputed

3335
03:06:20,600 --> 03:06:22,600
this claim. As a matter of fact, it was discovered

3336
03:06:22,600 --> 03:06:24,600
that the teacher mentioned had retired from his role,

3337
03:06:24,600 --> 03:06:26,600
passing on from this world in 2019.

3338
03:06:26,600 --> 03:06:28,600
Along with other supposed inconsistencies,

3339
03:06:28,600 --> 03:06:30,600
this was covered in a one and a half hour video

3340
03:06:30,600 --> 03:06:32,600
uploaded by a creator called mysterious.

3341
03:06:32,600 --> 03:06:34,600
Then the fourth time

3342
03:06:34,600 --> 03:06:36,600
she mentions this same story is on

3343
03:06:36,600 --> 03:06:38,600
TikTok on March 19th

3344
03:06:38,600 --> 03:06:40,600
2021. This time, Trisha

3345
03:06:40,600 --> 03:06:42,600
encourages her followers

3346
03:06:42,600 --> 03:06:44,600
to search the teacher and look up his

3347
03:06:44,600 --> 03:06:46,600
arrest. So Trisha specifically

3348
03:06:46,600 --> 03:06:48,600
says that this teacher has been arrested.

3349
03:06:48,600 --> 03:06:50,600
It seems legit, right? Surely if

3350
03:06:50,600 --> 03:06:52,600
Trisha is encouraging their audience to

3351
03:06:52,600 --> 03:06:54,600
look this up, it would pop right up when you

3352
03:06:54,600 --> 03:06:56,600
search it. That isn't the case at all. In fact,

3353
03:06:56,600 --> 03:06:58,600
when you Google exactly what Trisha says,

3354
03:06:58,600 --> 03:07:00,600
this teacher does pop up under the

3355
03:07:00,600 --> 03:07:02,600
top results, but it isn't because he was

3356
03:07:02,600 --> 03:07:04,600
arrested. It was because he passed away

3357
03:07:04,600 --> 03:07:06,600
in 2019 and his obituary

3358
03:07:06,600 --> 03:07:08,600
pops up when you Google what she

3359
03:07:08,600 --> 03:07:10,600
says. This observation began to

3360
03:07:10,600 --> 03:07:12,600
garner traction in forums and comment sections

3361
03:07:12,600 --> 03:07:14,600
with some calling on Ethan to amend the story

3362
03:07:14,600 --> 03:07:16,600
with minor information available, and on the

3363
03:07:16,600 --> 03:07:18,600
11th of September, he released a statement.

3364
03:07:18,600 --> 03:07:20,600
This echoed much of what the concerned

3365
03:07:20,600 --> 03:07:22,600
parties at the time were professing, that

3366
03:07:22,600 --> 03:07:24,600
although it was not necessarily his place to

3367
03:07:24,600 --> 03:07:26,600
discredit a survivor's story, he also couldn't

3368
03:07:26,600 --> 03:07:28,600
keep that story up in good faith knowing the

3369
03:07:28,600 --> 03:07:30,600
elements of it simply weren't true. Now

3370
03:07:30,600 --> 03:07:32,600
it's completely fair to acknowledge that given how

3371
03:07:32,600 --> 03:07:34,600
trauma affects memory and recalls certain

3372
03:07:34,600 --> 03:07:36,600
events, it's possible that Trisha may have confused

3373
03:07:36,600 --> 03:07:38,600
the details and names related to these

3374
03:07:38,600 --> 03:07:40,600
accounts. However, with the previous contradictions

3375
03:07:40,600 --> 03:07:42,600
in mind, it obviously occurred to

3376
03:07:42,600 --> 03:07:44,600
Ethan that maybe there was the possibility

3377
03:07:44,600 --> 03:07:46,600
that this version of events had been somewhat

3378
03:07:46,600 --> 03:07:48,600
fabricated, and in that case, especially

3379
03:07:48,600 --> 03:07:50,600
when dealing with criminal allegations, it's fair

3380
03:07:50,600 --> 03:07:52,600
to err on the side of caution. Ethan had

3381
03:07:52,600 --> 03:07:54,600
also followed up privately with Trisha,

3382
03:07:54,600 --> 03:07:56,600
seeking clarification of these claims, with many

3383
03:07:56,600 --> 03:07:58,600
audience members also publicly stating their

3384
03:07:58,600 --> 03:08:00,600
desire for this to be addressed. How did they

3385
03:08:00,600 --> 03:08:02,600
respond to this inquiry? Well, Trisha

3386
03:08:02,600 --> 03:08:04,600
first found a deluge of tweets defending

3387
03:08:04,600 --> 03:08:06,600
their mimosas from those who they felt were applying

3388
03:08:06,600 --> 03:08:08,600
pressure, and feeling threatened by

3389
03:08:08,600 --> 03:08:10,600
Ethan's turn, the DMs decided to share the messages

3390
03:08:10,600 --> 03:08:12,600
themselves, and let people decide on

3391
03:08:12,600 --> 03:08:14,600
who was behaving with the most decorum,

3392
03:08:14,600 --> 03:08:16,600
and honestly, it's a dumpster fire, with

3393
03:08:16,600 --> 03:08:18,600
everyone throwing blame at each other's feet.

3394
03:08:18,600 --> 03:08:20,600
Ethan compels Trisha to make a public statement,

3395
03:08:20,600 --> 03:08:22,600
and Trisha shares many posts that they believe

3396
03:08:22,600 --> 03:08:24,600
were contributing to unnecessary harassment.

3397
03:08:24,600 --> 03:08:26,600
Both Trisha and Ethan seem to use this

3398
03:08:26,600 --> 03:08:28,600
accused individual's family in their narrative,

3399
03:08:28,600 --> 03:08:30,600
Ethan in his post, and Trisha in the messages.

3400
03:08:30,600 --> 03:08:32,600
It's hard to know what the family themselves

3401
03:08:32,600 --> 03:08:34,600
want, but I'm not sure this is it.

3402
03:08:34,600 --> 03:08:36,600
In the end, they become secondary to

3403
03:08:36,600 --> 03:08:38,600
further allegations levelled towards Trisha's

3404
03:08:38,600 --> 03:08:40,600
fiancé, Moses, which had been circulating

3405
03:08:40,600 --> 03:08:42,600
recently as well. These allegations included

3406
03:08:42,600 --> 03:08:44,600
stealthing, which, as I understand it, is the

3407
03:08:44,600 --> 03:08:46,600
removal of the contraceptive device during

3408
03:08:46,600 --> 03:08:48,600
sex, without the consent of the partner.

3409
03:08:48,600 --> 03:08:50,600
Allegations also resurface surrounding

3410
03:08:50,600 --> 03:08:52,600
Moses's intent to date Trisha in the first

3411
03:08:52,600 --> 03:08:54,600
place, with some still wondering if he was just there

3412
03:08:54,600 --> 03:08:56,600
for the money. He responds to some of these claims in a

3413
03:08:56,600 --> 03:08:58,600
tweet longer where he asserts that the main complainant

3414
03:08:58,600 --> 03:09:00,600
had an unhealthy obsession with him, which has

3415
03:09:00,600 --> 03:09:02,600
subsequently warped their view, sharing

3416
03:09:02,600 --> 03:09:04,600
DMs to supposedly substantiate this.

3417
03:09:04,600 --> 03:09:06,600
It brings one person's motive into

3418
03:09:06,600 --> 03:09:08,600
question, but it doesn't disprove the

3419
03:09:08,600 --> 03:09:10,600
claims themselves, especially the ones made

3420
03:09:10,600 --> 03:09:12,600
by others. With that said, it's hard to

3421
03:09:12,600 --> 03:09:14,600
comment further when you don't know these people

3422
03:09:14,600 --> 03:09:16,600
involved, and I honestly don't.

3423
03:09:16,600 --> 03:09:18,600
However, in the DMs, Ethan

3424
03:09:18,600 --> 03:09:20,600
expresses belief in the person levelling these

3425
03:09:20,600 --> 03:09:22,600
accusations, and seems to imply that Trisha

3426
03:09:22,600 --> 03:09:24,600
is being rather hypocritical in their stance.

3427
03:09:24,600 --> 03:09:26,600
They express visible distress to the situation.

3428
03:09:41,600 --> 03:09:43,600
This was clearly having a negative

3429
03:09:43,600 --> 03:09:45,600
impact on others as well though, with Ethan

3430
03:09:45,600 --> 03:09:47,600
announcing that he and Hila would be taking a week

3431
03:09:47,600 --> 03:09:49,600
off the podcast in light of everything. The stress

3432
03:09:49,600 --> 03:09:51,600
has just become too much for them to bear.

3433
03:09:51,600 --> 03:09:53,600
At this point, although I think everyone was exhausted,

3434
03:09:53,600 --> 03:09:55,600
people were by no means appeased, and

3435
03:09:55,600 --> 03:09:57,600
remnants of the feud persisted over the following

3436
03:09:57,600 --> 03:09:59,600
weeks, with a variety of people and media sources

3437
03:09:59,600 --> 03:10:01,600
contributing their think pieces.

3438
03:10:01,600 --> 03:10:03,600
Much of this occurred on fan forums, where

3439
03:10:03,600 --> 03:10:05,600
one person shared a message from someone who claimed

3440
03:10:05,600 --> 03:10:07,600
to be a former student at Trisha's school. They

3441
03:10:07,600 --> 03:10:09,600
attested that although the teacher in question had

3442
03:10:09,600 --> 03:10:11,600
been dismissed from their role for possibly

3443
03:10:11,600 --> 03:10:13,600
disreputable behaviour, it wasn't related to his

3444
03:10:13,600 --> 03:10:15,600
conduct towards the students specifically. Once again,

3445
03:10:15,600 --> 03:10:17,600
this wasn't verified, and to be honest, it's quite

3446
03:10:17,600 --> 03:10:19,600
hard to verify without people revealing private

3447
03:10:19,600 --> 03:10:21,600
details, which most people aren't, but

3448
03:10:21,600 --> 03:10:23,600
it was more food for thought. In response

3449
03:10:23,600 --> 03:10:25,600
to Ethan's request and pressure from the public sphere,

3450
03:10:25,600 --> 03:10:27,600
Trisha responded on the 15th of September,

3451
03:10:27,600 --> 03:10:29,600
with a video titled Addressing Everything.

3452
03:10:29,600 --> 03:10:31,600
I'm not going to go over the details

3453
03:10:31,600 --> 03:10:33,600
specifically, but Trisha maintains their stories

3454
03:10:33,600 --> 03:10:35,600
and in response to the new form narrative

3455
03:10:35,600 --> 03:10:37,600
of their supposed lying, contends that

3456
03:10:37,600 --> 03:10:39,600
knowingly lying is not the same as misspeaking,

3457
03:10:39,600 --> 03:10:41,600
which is what they feel they did. They say

3458
03:10:41,600 --> 03:10:43,600
they don't fact check and have a tendency to spew

3459
03:10:43,600 --> 03:10:45,600
second hand information without actually

3460
03:10:45,600 --> 03:10:47,600
understanding it themselves. They take responsibility

3461
03:10:47,600 --> 03:10:49,600
for that, but they don't agree with the characterisations

3462
03:10:49,600 --> 03:10:51,600
presented by many of their critics,

3463
03:10:51,600 --> 03:10:53,600
especially those in the forums.

3464
03:10:53,600 --> 03:10:55,600
There's a difference between misspeaking,

3465
03:10:55,600 --> 03:10:57,600
hearing things, and not getting all the facts right, not fact

3466
03:10:57,600 --> 03:10:59,600
checking, and

3467
03:10:59,600 --> 03:11:01,600
versus sharing

3468
03:11:01,600 --> 03:11:03,600
something you know to not be true for

3469
03:11:03,600 --> 03:11:05,600
the malicious intent of tricking someone or

3470
03:11:05,600 --> 03:11:07,600
making someone look bad.

3471
03:11:07,600 --> 03:11:09,600
And so,

3472
03:11:09,600 --> 03:11:11,600
I get stories

3473
03:11:11,600 --> 03:11:13,600
mixed up, I hear things from people, and I don't fact check, and that

3474
03:11:13,600 --> 03:11:15,600
was ultimately why I should never have had a podcast,

3475
03:11:15,600 --> 03:11:17,600
I should never have been in front of me, but

3476
03:11:17,600 --> 03:11:19,600
I'm not the only person in the world to

3477
03:11:19,600 --> 03:11:21,600
do that. Having said that,

3478
03:11:21,600 --> 03:11:23,600
I have never lied

3479
03:11:23,600 --> 03:11:25,600
about

3480
03:11:25,600 --> 03:11:27,600
any things that have happened to me.

3481
03:11:27,600 --> 03:11:29,600
The truth is difficult sometimes,

3482
03:11:29,600 --> 03:11:31,600
and sometimes we have to accept that we'll never

3483
03:11:31,600 --> 03:11:33,600
know the truth fully. What you ultimately had was

3484
03:11:33,600 --> 03:11:35,600
two very vehement factions, and when that

3485
03:11:35,600 --> 03:11:37,600
arises, it can be difficult to deal with.

3486
03:11:37,600 --> 03:11:39,600
It was certainly fostered in environments like Reddit

3487
03:11:39,600 --> 03:11:41,600
where fans of one side tended to convene.

3488
03:11:41,600 --> 03:11:43,600
I don't think it's completely fair to say that because

3489
03:11:43,600 --> 03:11:45,600
someone misplaced details, the whole

3490
03:11:45,600 --> 03:11:47,600
story is false, but at the same time,

3491
03:11:47,600 --> 03:11:49,600
Trisha's response still didn't placate the criticism

3492
03:11:49,600 --> 03:11:51,600
relating to stories where there was contradictory

3493
03:11:51,600 --> 03:11:53,600
evidence available. In a way,

3494
03:11:53,600 --> 03:11:55,600
no two situations are the same, and

3495
03:11:55,600 --> 03:11:57,600
they shouldn't be treated as such, even if

3496
03:11:57,600 --> 03:11:59,600
someone is an unreliable narrator, but when

3497
03:11:59,600 --> 03:12:01,600
the accusations at hand were becoming so

3498
03:12:01,600 --> 03:12:03,600
sensitive, the tensions were only flaring

3499
03:12:03,600 --> 03:12:05,600
further. As Trisha said while defending

3500
03:12:05,600 --> 03:12:07,600
Moses, people can lie,

3501
03:12:07,600 --> 03:12:09,600
and the question was whether that person

3502
03:12:09,600 --> 03:12:11,600
was Trisha.

3503
03:12:17,600 --> 03:12:19,600
In the week after their video,

3504
03:12:19,600 --> 03:12:21,600
Trisha removed over 1000 videos

3505
03:12:21,600 --> 03:12:23,600
from their channel, cleansing approximately

3506
03:12:23,600 --> 03:12:25,600
1 billion views of their work, and the week

3507
03:12:25,600 --> 03:12:27,600
after, Ethan announced the start of their new

3508
03:12:27,600 --> 03:12:29,600
collaborative project with the less controversial

3509
03:12:29,600 --> 03:12:31,600
Hassan Piker. Less controversial.

3510
03:12:37,600 --> 03:12:39,600
With the family connection also firmly

3511
03:12:39,600 --> 03:12:41,600
intact, as it would be fair to assume that this

3512
03:12:41,600 --> 03:12:43,600
would end the drama, especially with Ethan

3513
03:12:43,600 --> 03:12:45,600
seemingly making a commitment to withdraw from

3514
03:12:45,600 --> 03:12:47,600
discussing Trisha, and Trisha seemingly wanting

3515
03:12:47,600 --> 03:12:49,600
the drama to be over. However, a lot of

3516
03:12:49,600 --> 03:12:51,600
internet criticism persisted, particularly

3517
03:12:51,600 --> 03:12:53,600
the two sides who wanted to portray

3518
03:12:53,600 --> 03:12:55,600
the other side as dishonest, because what we

3519
03:12:55,600 --> 03:12:57,600
saw was a stalemate, which meant

3520
03:12:57,600 --> 03:12:59,600
fans felt completely free to make assumptions

3521
03:12:59,600 --> 03:13:01,600
about the characters of people they were criticising.

3522
03:13:01,600 --> 03:13:03,600
After being referenced in Ethan's stream, accounts

3523
03:13:03,600 --> 03:13:05,600
dedicated to publicising alleged inconsistencies

3524
03:13:05,600 --> 03:13:07,600
such as contradictions of Trish

3525
03:13:07,600 --> 03:13:09,600
on TikTok began to pick up traction,

3526
03:13:09,600 --> 03:13:11,600
only further creating groundswell around these

3527
03:13:11,600 --> 03:13:13,600
narratives. The account raises interesting points,

3528
03:13:13,600 --> 03:13:15,600
though at the same time, some of these clips

3529
03:13:15,600 --> 03:13:17,600
are a decade apart and are considerate of the fact

3530
03:13:17,600 --> 03:13:19,600
that people's perspectives change, but

3531
03:13:19,600 --> 03:13:21,600
we'll come to that in a moment.

3532
03:13:21,600 --> 03:13:23,600
Besides that, there were still occasional illusions

3533
03:13:23,600 --> 03:13:25,600
to each other's existence, and with Trisha's upcoming

3534
03:13:25,600 --> 03:13:27,600
marriage to Moses, it was hard to keep them both

3535
03:13:27,600 --> 03:13:29,600
out of mind too much, particularly when such

3536
03:13:29,600 --> 03:13:31,600
an event would usually bring the family together.

3537
03:13:47,600 --> 03:13:49,600
On December 10th, in a stream the day before

3538
03:13:49,600 --> 03:13:51,600
Trisha's wedding, Ethan made a comment in passing

3539
03:13:51,600 --> 03:13:53,600
that tomorrow was Hila's birthday,

3540
03:13:53,600 --> 03:13:55,600
which would have been the 11th. However,

3541
03:13:55,600 --> 03:13:57,600
Hila's birthday is actually on the 12th. This caused

3542
03:13:57,600 --> 03:13:59,600
some of Trisha's fandom to claim that Ethan and

3543
03:13:59,600 --> 03:14:01,600
Hila were lying about their birthday, to purposely

3544
03:14:01,600 --> 03:14:03,600
draw more hate towards Trisha, as some

3545
03:14:03,600 --> 03:14:05,600
other fans had also been claiming that Trisha was

3546
03:14:05,600 --> 03:14:07,600
purposely mimicking impactful dates of the

3547
03:14:07,600 --> 03:14:09,600
clients in a continued attempt to provoke them.

3548
03:14:15,600 --> 03:14:17,600
Going over the stream, it seems that Ethan may be

3549
03:14:17,600 --> 03:14:19,600
celebrating Hila's birthday on a Saturday, as he

3550
03:14:19,600 --> 03:14:21,600
declares that he's recording another episode of Leftovers,

3551
03:14:21,600 --> 03:14:23,600
the one with Hasan Biker, on the Sunday.

3552
03:14:23,600 --> 03:14:25,600
It'd be one hell of a way to try and rile

3553
03:14:25,600 --> 03:14:27,600
his fans up, though as shown, many audience

3554
03:14:27,600 --> 03:14:29,600
members' perspectives were so cynical that

3555
03:14:29,600 --> 03:14:31,600
they couldn't help but theorise if every comment

3556
03:14:31,600 --> 03:14:33,600
had an underlying meaning. It's unsure whether

3557
03:14:33,600 --> 03:14:35,600
either party believed that the other was taking

3558
03:14:35,600 --> 03:14:37,600
backhanded jabs at them, but this all seemed to

3559
03:14:37,600 --> 03:14:39,600
boil over when Trisha posted a rather tone-deaf

3560
03:14:39,600 --> 03:14:41,600
TikTok barely a few days after the wedding.

3561
03:14:41,600 --> 03:14:51,600
I mean, tone-deaf

3562
03:14:51,600 --> 03:14:53,600
is one way to put it, but it is just ridiculous

3563
03:14:53,600 --> 03:14:55,600
that they thought this was a good idea.

3564
03:14:55,600 --> 03:14:57,600
I mean, it's not an active admission that it's

3565
03:14:57,600 --> 03:14:59,600
what they did, but it's a pretty heavy inference.

3566
03:14:59,600 --> 03:15:01,600
I can't really see any other punchline

3567
03:15:01,600 --> 03:15:03,600
there, I'm pretty sure those dance moves

3568
03:15:03,600 --> 03:15:05,600
don't directly relate to Judaism, unless

3569
03:15:05,600 --> 03:15:07,600
they're implying that such seductive dance moves

3570
03:15:07,600 --> 03:15:09,600
are payment, but I have to admit I'm not familiar

3571
03:15:09,600 --> 03:15:11,600
with that currency either. Either way, it's

3572
03:15:11,600 --> 03:15:13,600
anti-Semitic, and Ethan, displeased with this,

3573
03:15:13,600 --> 03:15:15,600
decided to break his vow of silence and directly

3574
03:15:15,600 --> 03:15:17,600
address Trisha in a response.

3575
03:15:17,600 --> 03:15:19,600
So you say you couldn't finish your

3576
03:15:19,600 --> 03:15:21,600
conversion classes, which

3577
03:15:21,600 --> 03:15:23,600
tells me that you don't care

3578
03:15:23,600 --> 03:15:25,600
enough about the culture to put in the

3579
03:15:25,600 --> 03:15:27,600
actual work to do it the right way,

3580
03:15:27,600 --> 03:15:29,600
and then you say that you just paid off a

3581
03:15:29,600 --> 03:15:31,600
rabbi to just say you're

3582
03:15:31,600 --> 03:15:33,600
Jewish, which is, first of all, a lie,

3583
03:15:33,600 --> 03:15:35,600
no rabbi would do that, and second of all,

3584
03:15:35,600 --> 03:15:37,600
anti-Semitic, because it just propagates

3585
03:15:37,600 --> 03:15:39,600
the notion that Jews only care about

3586
03:15:39,600 --> 03:15:41,600
money, and that's very

3587
03:15:41,600 --> 03:15:43,600
serious, you know, the whole

3588
03:15:43,600 --> 03:15:45,600
thing is just disgusting,

3589
03:15:45,600 --> 03:15:47,600
frankly, and if you don't want me to

3590
03:15:47,600 --> 03:15:49,600
stitch your anti-Semitic TikToks,

3591
03:15:49,600 --> 03:15:51,600
then turn Stitch off, I don't want to hear you

3592
03:15:51,600 --> 03:15:53,600
bitch about that, and the worst thing

3593
03:15:53,600 --> 03:15:55,600
about all this is that there's people

3594
03:15:55,600 --> 03:15:57,600
around you that know better.

3595
03:15:57,600 --> 03:15:59,600
One of these was done on TikTok where it explains how

3596
03:15:59,600 --> 03:16:01,600
Trisha was harmfully stereotyping those from his

3597
03:16:01,600 --> 03:16:03,600
religion, have a clearly feeling like he had not

3598
03:16:03,600 --> 03:16:05,600
contributed enough to the discourse, decided to

3599
03:16:05,600 --> 03:16:07,600
dedicate a section of his off-the-rails soundbite

3600
03:16:07,600 --> 03:16:09,600
stream to Trisha's comments, explaining

3601
03:16:09,600 --> 03:16:11,600
that with the wedding behind them, he had no reason

3602
03:16:11,600 --> 03:16:13,600
to hold back, attacking both Trisha,

3603
03:16:13,600 --> 03:16:15,600
Moses, and everyone else in the blast radius.

3604
03:16:15,600 --> 03:16:17,600
It seemed like a pretty cathartic experience

3605
03:16:17,600 --> 03:16:19,600
for him all in all. The soundbite of Trisha's

3606
03:16:19,600 --> 03:16:21,600
sister discussing the 5%

3607
03:16:21,600 --> 03:16:23,600
subsequently won the bitterly fought knockout

3608
03:16:23,600 --> 03:16:25,600
tournament, seemingly becoming immortalised

3609
03:16:25,600 --> 03:16:27,600
in H3 history.

3610
03:16:27,600 --> 03:16:29,600
Oh!

3611
03:16:29,600 --> 03:16:31,600
Oh!

3612
03:16:31,600 --> 03:16:33,600
17,000 votes

3613
03:16:33,600 --> 03:16:35,600
take that 5%, has gained

3614
03:16:35,600 --> 03:16:37,600
the lead, 51% take that

3615
03:16:37,600 --> 03:16:39,600
5%, it's all

3616
03:16:39,600 --> 03:16:41,600
unfolding. It is all

3617
03:16:41,600 --> 03:16:43,600
unfolding here at the

3618
03:16:43,600 --> 03:16:45,600
2021 H3.

3619
03:16:45,600 --> 03:16:47,600
He takes that 5%.

3620
03:16:47,600 --> 03:16:49,600
I'm speechless folks. It's clear that

3621
03:16:49,600 --> 03:16:51,600
although he hadn't spoke about the matter publicly for a

3622
03:16:51,600 --> 03:16:53,600
couple months, he hadn't stopped thinking about it.

3623
03:16:53,600 --> 03:16:55,600
As he had come equipped with a plethora of evidence

3624
03:16:55,600 --> 03:16:57,600
and anecdotes to combat the narrative

3625
03:16:57,600 --> 03:16:59,600
propounded by Trish and those around them.

3626
03:16:59,600 --> 03:17:01,600
In fact, this is arguably his most ruthless

3627
03:17:01,600 --> 03:17:03,600
stream of them all, showing very little regard

3628
03:17:03,600 --> 03:17:05,600
for the backlash that he may instigate, and revealing

3629
03:17:05,600 --> 03:17:07,600
some rather personal details about

3630
03:17:07,600 --> 03:17:09,600
Trisha.

3631
03:17:25,600 --> 03:17:27,600
I don't owe any

3632
03:17:27,600 --> 03:17:29,600
shit to anybody. And actually the

3633
03:17:29,600 --> 03:17:31,600
worst part is that Moses knows better.

3634
03:17:31,600 --> 03:17:33,600
I mean, he's f***ing enabling

3635
03:17:33,600 --> 03:17:35,600
straight up anti-Semitic

3636
03:17:35,600 --> 03:17:37,600
harmful tropes, making

3637
03:17:37,600 --> 03:17:39,600
a mockery of the religion, and

3638
03:17:39,600 --> 03:17:41,600
it's f***ing disgusting and they should both be

3639
03:17:41,600 --> 03:17:43,600
deeply ashamed and f*** them both. Peace

3640
03:17:43,600 --> 03:17:45,600
and love. By the way, this is coming

3641
03:17:45,600 --> 03:17:47,600
from the girl who did like

3642
03:17:47,600 --> 03:17:49,600
has done OF videos with her

3643
03:17:49,600 --> 03:17:51,600
whole f***ing family. So don't

3644
03:17:51,600 --> 03:17:53,600
feign like that you're so outraged

3645
03:17:53,600 --> 03:17:55,600
by this candle story.

3646
03:17:55,600 --> 03:17:57,600
You know, I mean, Kaylee,

3647
03:17:57,600 --> 03:17:59,600
if you were so worried about your mom

3648
03:17:59,600 --> 03:18:01,600
not knowing the intimate details of your

3649
03:18:01,600 --> 03:18:03,600
sex life, don't make

3650
03:18:03,600 --> 03:18:05,600
OF videos with her, you

3651
03:18:05,600 --> 03:18:07,600
f***ing freak.

3652
03:18:07,600 --> 03:18:09,600
And by the way,

3653
03:18:09,600 --> 03:18:11,600
people have dug up so many videos of Trisha

3654
03:18:11,600 --> 03:18:13,600
and Kaylee talking

3655
03:18:13,600 --> 03:18:15,600
with like really

3656
03:18:15,600 --> 03:18:17,600
detailed questions

3657
03:18:17,600 --> 03:18:19,600
about sex

3658
03:18:19,600 --> 03:18:21,600
with their mom.

3659
03:18:21,600 --> 03:18:23,600
Like disgusting, weird

3660
03:18:23,600 --> 03:18:25,600
shit that I would never in a million years

3661
03:18:25,600 --> 03:18:27,600
want to discuss. So you know what, Kaylee?

3662
03:18:29,600 --> 03:18:31,600
That wedding is over.

3663
03:18:31,600 --> 03:18:33,600
F*** you and your whole family.

3664
03:18:33,600 --> 03:18:35,600
How about that?

3665
03:18:35,600 --> 03:18:37,600
F*** you and the womb you came

3666
03:18:37,600 --> 03:18:39,600
out of.

3667
03:18:39,600 --> 03:18:41,600
How

3668
03:18:41,600 --> 03:18:43,600
about that, Kaylee?

3669
03:18:43,600 --> 03:18:45,600
And once I asked

3670
03:18:45,600 --> 03:18:47,600
once I

3671
03:18:47,600 --> 03:18:49,600
asked Moses if

3672
03:18:49,600 --> 03:18:51,600
she ever asked him to pretend

3673
03:18:51,600 --> 03:18:53,600
like he's Hila, and he said

3674
03:18:53,600 --> 03:18:55,600
yes, but he refuses to.

3675
03:18:55,600 --> 03:18:57,600
Well, if you ask Moses, they're all

3676
03:18:57,600 --> 03:18:59,600
water, so incest is fine.

3677
03:18:59,600 --> 03:19:01,600
All sex is the best to Moses

3678
03:19:01,600 --> 03:19:03,600
when everyone's water. He's like, hey, it's

3679
03:19:03,600 --> 03:19:05,600
all good, baby. Defense of like why-

3680
03:19:05,600 --> 03:19:07,600
I deleted it after I was up, after

3681
03:19:07,600 --> 03:19:09,600
everyone was telling me how f***ing dumb of a

3682
03:19:09,600 --> 03:19:11,600
take it was, but it was-

3683
03:19:11,600 --> 03:19:13,600
but everybody already downloaded it.

3684
03:19:13,600 --> 03:19:15,600
You already said it, and you tried some shit.

3685
03:19:15,600 --> 03:19:17,600
It ain't my f***ing

3686
03:19:17,600 --> 03:19:19,600
fault. You're an influencer. Don't act like you're not.

3687
03:19:19,600 --> 03:19:21,600
She is. She's been on the

3688
03:19:21,600 --> 03:19:23,600
videos. She has her own OF

3689
03:19:23,600 --> 03:19:25,600
account. She's

3690
03:19:25,600 --> 03:19:27,600
she's an internet personality. I don't give up.

3691
03:19:27,600 --> 03:19:29,600
So

3692
03:19:29,600 --> 03:19:35,600
got 5% of an operating brain.

3693
03:19:35,600 --> 03:19:37,600
Oh boy.

3694
03:19:39,600 --> 03:19:41,600
I was bottled up. What can I do?

3695
03:19:41,600 --> 03:19:43,600
Ethan isn't a person who necessarily

3696
03:19:43,600 --> 03:19:45,600
abides by the internet's code of honour

3697
03:19:45,600 --> 03:19:47,600
for the time, and whereas the milder individuals

3698
03:19:47,600 --> 03:19:49,600
who spectate this may find its savagery

3699
03:19:49,600 --> 03:19:51,600
a bit disconcerting, Ethan seems to be

3700
03:19:51,600 --> 03:19:53,600
under the impression that this is his justice

3701
03:19:53,600 --> 03:19:55,600
for all the times he has felt wronged by

3702
03:19:55,600 --> 03:19:57,600
Trisha's behaviour, their lies, their manipulation.

3703
03:19:57,600 --> 03:19:59,600
This was his chance to deliver that

3704
03:19:59,600 --> 03:20:01,600
blow. However, Trisha obviously didn't

3705
03:20:01,600 --> 03:20:03,600
respond well, releasing a video pleading with him

3706
03:20:03,600 --> 03:20:05,600
to leave her alone, calling both Ethan and

3707
03:20:05,600 --> 03:20:07,600
Ela obsessed, and basically every other word under

3708
03:20:07,600 --> 03:20:09,600
the sun that would frame them as a victim to the client's

3709
03:20:09,600 --> 03:20:11,600
endless tirade of abuse.

3710
03:20:11,600 --> 03:20:13,600
Every little jab,

3711
03:20:13,600 --> 03:20:15,600
every video

3712
03:20:15,600 --> 03:20:17,600
he's made obsessing about me.

3713
03:20:17,600 --> 03:20:19,600
It always

3714
03:20:19,600 --> 03:20:21,600
scares me.

3715
03:20:21,600 --> 03:20:23,600
The backlash I receive from

3716
03:20:23,600 --> 03:20:25,600
their subreddit and their fans

3717
03:20:25,600 --> 03:20:27,600
to Ethan himself just

3718
03:20:27,600 --> 03:20:29,600
obsessing over

3719
03:20:29,600 --> 03:20:31,600
every little thing I do.

3720
03:20:31,600 --> 03:20:33,600
Meanwhile, Ethan can't stop talking about

3721
03:20:33,600 --> 03:20:35,600
me. Can't stop getting

3722
03:20:35,600 --> 03:20:37,600
bans and strikes going off on Twitter

3723
03:20:37,600 --> 03:20:39,600
on just random people blocking his

3724
03:20:39,600 --> 03:20:41,600
content and just being so angry

3725
03:20:41,600 --> 03:20:43,600
and

3726
03:20:43,600 --> 03:20:45,600
lawsuits and all this stuff like that.

3727
03:20:45,600 --> 03:20:47,600
And I get it.

3728
03:20:47,600 --> 03:20:49,600
I get he's probably himself

3729
03:20:49,600 --> 03:20:51,600
in a dark place right now. Like, I really could

3730
03:20:51,600 --> 03:20:53,600
see that. I was like, I know he's in a dark

3731
03:20:53,600 --> 03:20:55,600
place, so OK, I'll take a couple jabs.

3732
03:20:55,600 --> 03:20:57,600
But this F them and

3733
03:20:57,600 --> 03:20:59,600
anti-Semitic and Moses enabling, talking

3734
03:20:59,600 --> 03:21:01,600
about Moses, talking about my sister, people

3735
03:21:01,600 --> 03:21:03,600
who literally did nothing in

3736
03:21:03,600 --> 03:21:05,600
this situation and bringing my

3737
03:21:05,600 --> 03:21:07,600
sister again, just

3738
03:21:07,600 --> 03:21:09,600
knowing he's inciting

3739
03:21:09,600 --> 03:21:11,600
all of this.

3740
03:21:11,600 --> 03:21:13,600
It went from having the

3741
03:21:13,600 --> 03:21:15,600
absolute best weekend

3742
03:21:15,600 --> 03:21:17,600
of my life

3743
03:21:17,600 --> 03:21:19,600
to this and everyone,

3744
03:21:19,600 --> 03:21:21,600
my family and Moses and

3745
03:21:21,600 --> 03:21:23,600
oh, he wants a reaction. Don't let him

3746
03:21:23,600 --> 03:21:25,600
get this reaction. And I'm like,

3747
03:21:25,600 --> 03:21:27,600
don't let him know that he ruined your

3748
03:21:27,600 --> 03:21:29,600
best weekend. I said, but he did.

3749
03:21:29,600 --> 03:21:31,600
He won. Like, can you

3750
03:21:31,600 --> 03:21:33,600
stop now? Please.

3751
03:21:33,600 --> 03:21:35,600
Like, please.

3752
03:21:35,600 --> 03:21:37,600
In this case, unlike previous

3753
03:21:37,600 --> 03:21:39,600
videos, Ethan relented and cut out

3754
03:21:39,600 --> 03:21:41,600
a large proportion of his Trisha rant.

3755
03:21:41,600 --> 03:21:43,600
It's also important to note that Ethan

3756
03:21:43,600 --> 03:21:45,600
was facing a pretty harsh set of characterisations

3757
03:21:45,600 --> 03:21:47,600
from an individual known as Ryan

3758
03:21:47,600 --> 03:21:49,600
Cavanagh, who had initiated a lawsuit against

3759
03:21:49,600 --> 03:21:51,600
the client. His lawsuit mentions Trisha by

3760
03:21:51,600 --> 03:21:53,600
name and frames them as a victim of

3761
03:21:53,600 --> 03:21:55,600
Ethan's actions. Ethan had been vocal about

3762
03:21:55,600 --> 03:21:57,600
the stress this lawsuit had caused him and may

3763
03:21:57,600 --> 03:21:59,600
have not wanted to increase any risk of

3764
03:21:59,600 --> 03:22:01,600
defeat, given that the case explicitly

3765
03:22:01,600 --> 03:22:03,600
mentions defamation on multiple

3766
03:22:03,600 --> 03:22:05,600
occasions. Ryan had also been blocking

3767
03:22:05,600 --> 03:22:07,600
many of Ethan's videos which he had tweeted

3768
03:22:07,600 --> 03:22:09,600
about around the time, and not too long after

3769
03:22:09,600 --> 03:22:11,600
he was again blocked from uploading after an

3770
03:22:11,600 --> 03:22:13,600
old video was supposedly mass reported

3771
03:22:13,600 --> 03:22:15,600
by trolls. Once more,

3772
03:22:15,600 --> 03:22:17,600
Ethan announced that he would take another break

3773
03:22:17,600 --> 03:22:19,600
even after having the strike removed.

3774
03:22:19,600 --> 03:22:21,600
It seemed that his attempt to close out this story

3775
03:22:21,600 --> 03:22:23,600
was opening more new wounds.

3776
03:22:23,600 --> 03:22:25,600
But why? Well,

3777
03:22:25,600 --> 03:22:27,600
because there's no situation

3778
03:22:27,600 --> 03:22:29,600
with Trisha in which you can win.

3779
03:22:35,600 --> 03:22:37,600
If

3780
03:22:37,600 --> 03:22:39,600
the contradictions of Trish's

3781
03:22:39,600 --> 03:22:41,600
TikTok account and other commentators

3782
03:22:41,600 --> 03:22:43,600
highlighted something, it's that Trisha

3783
03:22:43,600 --> 03:22:45,600
is probably the most inconsistent person

3784
03:22:45,600 --> 03:22:47,600
online. Now I divide these

3785
03:22:47,600 --> 03:22:49,600
inconsistencies into three components,

3786
03:22:49,600 --> 03:22:51,600
personal evolution, small

3787
03:22:51,600 --> 03:22:53,600
talk disparities, and inexplicable

3788
03:22:53,600 --> 03:22:55,600
lies. For example,

3789
03:22:55,600 --> 03:22:57,600
People asking about nanny and a bar mitzvah,

3790
03:22:57,600 --> 03:22:59,600
you know it's hard to say, it's hard to say until it happens,

3791
03:22:59,600 --> 03:23:01,600
like I would like to try

3792
03:23:01,600 --> 03:23:03,600
obviously without a nanny, I really

3793
03:23:03,600 --> 03:23:05,600
don't judge anyone that has them. When I have a kid,

3794
03:23:05,600 --> 03:23:07,600
I'm not gonna have nannies, that's pretty damn sure. What does that mean?

3795
03:23:07,600 --> 03:23:09,600
You're trying to attack our parental

3796
03:23:09,600 --> 03:23:11,600
abilities? There's something wrong with having a nanny?

3797
03:23:11,600 --> 03:23:13,600
My eyes, yes.

3798
03:23:13,600 --> 03:23:15,600
This one isn't really a direct contradiction,

3799
03:23:15,600 --> 03:23:17,600
especially with the context that at the time

3800
03:23:17,600 --> 03:23:19,600
they were trying to spite Ethan. It could just

3801
03:23:19,600 --> 03:23:21,600
be Trisha coming round to the idea of a nanny

3802
03:23:21,600 --> 03:23:23,600
and the possible merits to it, especially as

3803
03:23:23,600 --> 03:23:25,600
they are now pregnant. Small talk

3804
03:23:25,600 --> 03:23:27,600
disparity, on the other hand, doesn't really

3805
03:23:27,600 --> 03:23:29,600
show much growth between conflicting

3806
03:23:29,600 --> 03:23:31,600
statements, but also could be explained

3807
03:23:31,600 --> 03:23:33,600
by the fact that Trisha is someone who talks a lot

3808
03:23:33,600 --> 03:23:35,600
and their opinions seem to fluctuate

3809
03:23:35,600 --> 03:23:37,600
rather turbulently, but also ultimately

3810
03:23:37,600 --> 03:23:39,600
too inconsequential to care about.

3811
03:23:39,600 --> 03:23:41,600
The content people seemed most alarmed by

3812
03:23:41,600 --> 03:23:43,600
was the inexplicable lies, statements

3813
03:23:43,600 --> 03:23:45,600
that seemed impossible to make sense of

3814
03:23:45,600 --> 03:23:47,600
in the context of how the truth appeared.

3815
03:23:47,600 --> 03:23:49,600
My dog was because of David and Jason, they just surprised me

3816
03:23:49,600 --> 03:23:51,600
with it for a vlog and made me keep it even though I never asked

3817
03:23:51,600 --> 03:23:53,600
for a dog. And yes, we did talk about this,

3818
03:23:53,600 --> 03:23:55,600
but everyone was like, oh my god, you can't just surprise me with a

3819
03:23:55,600 --> 03:23:57,600
puppy, I have been wanting a puppy for a

3820
03:23:57,600 --> 03:23:59,600
really long time. We had talked about it for

3821
03:23:59,600 --> 03:24:01,600
a while that I wanted a Pomeranian, that my mom

3822
03:24:01,600 --> 03:24:03,600
would help me take care of it. Just to be clear, we did

3823
03:24:03,600 --> 03:24:05,600
talk about this and the plan was to

3824
03:24:05,600 --> 03:24:07,600
maybe give the dog to Trisha's

3825
03:24:07,600 --> 03:24:09,600
mom who really wants a Pomeranian. This was first brought into

3826
03:24:09,600 --> 03:24:11,600
context by the puppy clip, and although

3827
03:24:11,600 --> 03:24:13,600
certain falsehoods like the allegations against

3828
03:24:13,600 --> 03:24:15,600
a schoolteacher could be put down to confusion,

3829
03:24:15,600 --> 03:24:17,600
others like that relating to the puppy

3830
03:24:17,600 --> 03:24:19,600
are much harder to explain. Where's the

3831
03:24:19,600 --> 03:24:21,600
ambiguity there? Trisha said something

3832
03:24:21,600 --> 03:24:23,600
that was just apparently objectively

3833
03:24:23,600 --> 03:24:25,600
false, and that's far from the only example.

3834
03:24:25,600 --> 03:24:27,600
I said earlier that Trisha was most at ease

3835
03:24:27,600 --> 03:24:29,600
when firing off information and stories about topics

3836
03:24:29,600 --> 03:24:31,600
that interest them. That was when the

3837
03:24:31,600 --> 03:24:33,600
podcast ran at its smoothest, but it was only

3838
03:24:33,600 --> 03:24:35,600
because it was what made viewers and colleagues

3839
03:24:35,600 --> 03:24:37,600
feel most comfortable.

3840
03:24:49,600 --> 03:24:51,600
It's confusing and hard to really

3841
03:24:51,600 --> 03:24:53,600
understand, because you're often left thinking

3842
03:24:53,600 --> 03:24:55,600
why would you even need to lie about something

3843
03:24:55,600 --> 03:24:57,600
as trivial as that, but it's very difficult

3844
03:24:57,600 --> 03:24:59,600
to come to any other conclusion than that

3845
03:24:59,600 --> 03:25:01,600
this was intentional, but then the question

3846
03:25:01,600 --> 03:25:03,600
comes down to what motive causes

3847
03:25:03,600 --> 03:25:05,600
a person to state inaccuracies like

3848
03:25:05,600 --> 03:25:07,600
Trisha does, not just about one detail

3849
03:25:07,600 --> 03:25:09,600
or the other, but in general. Well, a simple

3850
03:25:09,600 --> 03:25:11,600
response would be that Trisha is a troll,

3851
03:25:11,600 --> 03:25:13,600
and they have been trolling long throughout their YouTube

3852
03:25:13,600 --> 03:25:15,600
career. On one hand, yes, this is

3853
03:25:15,600 --> 03:25:17,600
true, Trisha has been a notorious troll

3854
03:25:17,600 --> 03:25:19,600
since the early days of this platform, but on the other

3855
03:25:19,600 --> 03:25:21,600
hand, it seemed that trolling was a bit

3856
03:25:21,600 --> 03:25:23,600
more identifiable, particularly in the

3857
03:25:23,600 --> 03:25:25,600
narratives and the tone. It was also something that

3858
03:25:25,600 --> 03:25:27,600
Trisha claimed to have left behind them on a fair

3859
03:25:27,600 --> 03:25:29,600
few occasions when discussing it.

3860
03:25:53,600 --> 03:26:13,600
This was not

3861
03:26:13,600 --> 03:26:15,600
just a relationship that enabled Trisha

3862
03:26:15,600 --> 03:26:17,600
to post a few videos, this was a

3863
03:26:17,600 --> 03:26:19,600
fully fledged business partnership that generated

3864
03:26:19,600 --> 03:26:21,600
significant income for our prima

3865
03:26:21,600 --> 03:26:23,600
donna. It precipitated a romantic bond

3866
03:26:23,600 --> 03:26:25,600
that produced a marriage and a pregnancy

3867
03:26:25,600 --> 03:26:27,600
for all that to be a troll would require some

3868
03:26:27,600 --> 03:26:29,600
mastermind level preparation and

3869
03:26:29,600 --> 03:26:31,600
emotional robustness, that even Trisha

3870
03:26:31,600 --> 03:26:33,600
in all their longevity and fortitude

3871
03:26:33,600 --> 03:26:35,600
may not be capable of. What's the

3872
03:26:35,600 --> 03:26:37,600
alternative explanation then?

3873
03:26:37,600 --> 03:26:39,600
Well, I think the idea of Trisha being a troll

3874
03:26:39,600 --> 03:26:41,600
is reductionist. A troll is known to actively

3875
03:26:41,600 --> 03:26:43,600
carry out undesirable actions for attention,

3876
03:26:43,600 --> 03:26:45,600
and although Trisha has done that, they're not

3877
03:26:45,600 --> 03:26:47,600
just a lover of negative attention.

3878
03:26:47,600 --> 03:26:49,600
Trisha has a way of inserting themselves into

3879
03:26:49,600 --> 03:26:51,600
stories that makes them relevant to the situation

3880
03:26:51,600 --> 03:26:53,600
at hand. I think if any of the perceived

3881
03:26:53,600 --> 03:26:55,600
contradictions highlight a common factor,

3882
03:26:55,600 --> 03:26:57,600
these are often situations where the people who Trisha

3883
03:26:57,600 --> 03:26:59,600
may be commenting on are unlikely to respond

3884
03:26:59,600 --> 03:27:01,600
on a public platform in a way that may

3885
03:27:01,600 --> 03:27:03,600
illuminate these lies, either because they are

3886
03:27:03,600 --> 03:27:05,600
broad in drama that contains valid criticisms

3887
03:27:05,600 --> 03:27:07,600
so they struggle to respond in general, or they

3888
03:27:07,600 --> 03:27:09,600
literally can't respond. Trisha's

3889
03:27:09,600 --> 03:27:11,600
stories always seem to be rooted in

3890
03:27:11,600 --> 03:27:13,600
some grain of truth, but it's hard to know

3891
03:27:13,600 --> 03:27:15,600
exactly what followed.

3892
03:27:19,600 --> 03:27:35,600
One of the curious stories Trisha told back

3893
03:27:35,600 --> 03:27:37,600
in the day was about an interaction with

3894
03:27:37,600 --> 03:27:39,600
famous actor Robin Williams, who passed

3895
03:27:39,600 --> 03:27:41,600
on from this world far too soon. Trisha

3896
03:27:41,600 --> 03:27:43,600
stated that when they worked as a courtesan,

3897
03:27:43,600 --> 03:27:45,600
they'd pass across. This story was

3898
03:27:45,600 --> 03:27:47,600
recounted on their channel not too long after

3899
03:27:47,600 --> 03:27:49,600
Robin's passing, and repeated on the podcast

3900
03:27:49,600 --> 03:27:51,600
where Trisha brings it up, and then seems

3901
03:27:51,600 --> 03:27:53,600
hesitant to elaborate further.

3902
03:28:17,600 --> 03:28:25,600
Now once again with the

3903
03:28:25,600 --> 03:28:27,600
legacy of Robin Williams, and the awareness

3904
03:28:27,600 --> 03:28:29,600
that we have of his often complicated

3905
03:28:29,600 --> 03:28:31,600
and problematic character, it's not

3906
03:28:31,600 --> 03:28:33,600
in the realms of impossibility. At the

3907
03:28:33,600 --> 03:28:35,600
same time, it's another situation which

3908
03:28:35,600 --> 03:28:37,600
involves an admittedly rather unlikely

3909
03:28:37,600 --> 03:28:39,600
scenario with only one available source.

3910
03:28:39,600 --> 03:28:41,600
This is the case with a fair few

3911
03:28:41,600 --> 03:28:43,600
other public figures, and even private

3912
03:28:43,600 --> 03:28:45,600
ones. Although in many cases these stories

3913
03:28:45,600 --> 03:28:47,600
are mostly inconsequential, the discomfort

3914
03:28:47,600 --> 03:28:49,600
from Ethan's perspective was that he believed

3915
03:28:49,600 --> 03:28:51,600
he was used to prop up a false

3916
03:28:51,600 --> 03:28:53,600
portrait of someone, and it's not

3917
03:28:53,600 --> 03:28:55,600
hard to see why. It's important

3918
03:28:55,600 --> 03:28:57,600
not to understate the more sophisticated

3919
03:28:57,600 --> 03:28:59,600
aspect relating to Trisha's understanding

3920
03:28:59,600 --> 03:29:01,600
of internet culture. Trisha isn't

3921
03:29:01,600 --> 03:29:03,600
someone who just exists to lie, they

3922
03:29:03,600 --> 03:29:05,600
have desires and aspirations. I think

3923
03:29:05,600 --> 03:29:07,600
in this case the podcast provided platform

3924
03:29:07,600 --> 03:29:09,600
for Trisha to tell a new story that would

3925
03:29:09,600 --> 03:29:11,600
contextualise their behaviour, that would almost

3926
03:29:11,600 --> 03:29:13,600
be this new chapter in their life.

3927
03:29:13,600 --> 03:29:15,600
Trisha knows what to do to maximise

3928
03:29:15,600 --> 03:29:17,600
their attention, and although in the past the

3929
03:29:17,600 --> 03:29:19,600
best way to do this was through often

3930
03:29:19,600 --> 03:29:21,600
shallow provocation, here it was

3931
03:29:21,600 --> 03:29:23,600
actually to create a deeper, more sympathetic

3932
03:29:23,600 --> 03:29:25,600
portrait, one that would make them look

3933
03:29:25,600 --> 03:29:27,600
more human and have the audience rooting for

3934
03:29:27,600 --> 03:29:29,600
them. Many people would have that naturally

3935
03:29:29,600 --> 03:29:31,600
within their character, but with Trisha it's

3936
03:29:31,600 --> 03:29:33,600
like another persona for each moment.

3937
03:29:33,600 --> 03:29:35,600
Trisha nature to adapt to situations

3938
03:29:35,600 --> 03:29:37,600
and bring themselves to the forefront of conversation

3939
03:29:37,600 --> 03:29:39,600
is so prominent that they couldn't help

3940
03:29:39,600 --> 03:29:41,600
but misrepresent certain situations, while

3941
03:29:41,600 --> 03:29:43,600
spectators looked on and nodded their head.

3942
03:29:43,600 --> 03:29:45,600
When Trisha was caught up in lies before

3943
03:29:45,600 --> 03:29:47,600
in their first appearance on the H3

3944
03:29:47,600 --> 03:29:49,600
podcast, when the lies were quite

3945
03:29:49,600 --> 03:29:51,600
obvious, people didn't feel so threatened

3946
03:29:51,600 --> 03:29:53,600
by them, but as people bought into

3947
03:29:53,600 --> 03:29:55,600
the greater story in its entirety

3948
03:29:55,600 --> 03:29:57,600
the impact clearly affected people

3949
03:29:57,600 --> 03:29:59,600
more significantly. While the

3950
03:29:59,600 --> 03:30:01,600
podcast was running smoothly, everything

3951
03:30:01,600 --> 03:30:03,600
went well for them, their platform was used

3952
03:30:03,600 --> 03:30:05,600
and it's clear that many began to fall in

3953
03:30:05,600 --> 03:30:07,600
love with the Trisha they thought they were becoming

3954
03:30:07,600 --> 03:30:09,600
familiar with, and because they deemed Trisha

3955
03:30:09,600 --> 03:30:11,600
a likeable individual, very few

3956
03:30:11,600 --> 03:30:13,600
questioned these stories. I don't know

3957
03:30:13,600 --> 03:30:15,600
Trisha inside out to say without a shadow

3958
03:30:15,600 --> 03:30:17,600
of a doubt that they actively, intently

3959
03:30:17,600 --> 03:30:19,600
lied, but they

3960
03:30:19,600 --> 03:30:21,600
did not tell the truth, and in the months

3961
03:30:21,600 --> 03:30:23,600
following it was clear that Ethan grew bitter

3962
03:30:23,600 --> 03:30:25,600
believing that he had been duped into providing

3963
03:30:25,600 --> 03:30:27,600
a platform for someone to speak so carelessly

3964
03:30:27,600 --> 03:30:29,600
and using his trust to provide an

3965
03:30:29,600 --> 03:30:31,600
extra veneer of credibility,

3966
03:30:31,600 --> 03:30:33,600
but that's only one perspective.

3967
03:30:33,600 --> 03:30:35,600
What's the other? How much blame

3968
03:30:35,600 --> 03:30:37,600
can we assign to Trisha

3969
03:30:37,600 --> 03:30:39,600
and how much can we assign elsewhere?

3970
03:31:07,600 --> 03:31:17,600
In the kind of months after their

3971
03:31:17,600 --> 03:31:19,600
pre-Christmas battle, though Ethan and Hila

3972
03:31:19,600 --> 03:31:21,600
had mostly cleaned up their legal obligations

3973
03:31:21,600 --> 03:31:23,600
relating to Ryan Cavanagh, the release of certain

3974
03:31:23,600 --> 03:31:25,600
pressures didn't draw them back to the topic of

3975
03:31:25,600 --> 03:31:27,600
Trisha, other than a few subtweets,

3976
03:31:27,600 --> 03:31:29,600
likely because Ethan going full mask off wasn't

3977
03:31:29,600 --> 03:31:31,600
actually a rewarding experience.

3978
03:31:31,600 --> 03:31:33,600
Trisha did what many expect, and put Ethan in a

3979
03:31:33,600 --> 03:31:35,600
position where if he said any more, he'd be the

3980
03:31:35,600 --> 03:31:37,600
aggressor, he'd be the one unduly

3981
03:31:37,600 --> 03:31:39,600
ruining a person's honeymoon, yet

3982
03:31:39,600 --> 03:31:41,600
many were still frustrated, pointing towards

3983
03:31:41,600 --> 03:31:43,600
all the times that Trisha had spoken endlessly

3984
03:31:43,600 --> 03:31:45,600
about Frenemies after they broke up,

3985
03:31:45,600 --> 03:31:47,600
but unfortunately, they're not quite

3986
03:31:47,600 --> 03:31:49,600
the same, are they? One is

3987
03:31:49,600 --> 03:31:51,600
Ethan, and one is Trisha.

3988
03:31:51,600 --> 03:31:53,600
Many of the accounts that we've used today,

3989
03:31:53,600 --> 03:31:55,600
and many of the people who've taken to call Trisha

3990
03:31:55,600 --> 03:31:57,600
out for their behaviour during Frenemies, were

3991
03:31:57,600 --> 03:31:59,600
completely on board only months before,

3992
03:31:59,600 --> 03:32:01,600
despite the fact that many of Trisha's comments

3993
03:32:01,600 --> 03:32:03,600
were firstly made on Frenemies, and made long

3994
03:32:03,600 --> 03:32:05,600
before Frenemies, statements that were well known

3995
03:32:05,600 --> 03:32:07,600
and acknowledged at the time.

3996
03:32:07,600 --> 03:32:09,600
In many ways, Trisha's demeanour always strangled

3997
03:32:09,600 --> 03:32:11,600
the line of trolling master seriousness,

3998
03:32:11,600 --> 03:32:13,600
and people expressing outrage at this shouldn't

3999
03:32:13,600 --> 03:32:15,600
necessarily be that surprised.

4000
03:32:15,600 --> 03:32:17,600
Trisha did exactly what they normally do.

4001
03:32:17,600 --> 03:32:19,600
Isn't this what we expected to happen

4002
03:32:19,600 --> 03:32:21,600
anyway? In Trisha's first collaboration

4003
03:32:21,600 --> 03:32:23,600
with the clients, they were called out for specifically

4004
03:32:23,600 --> 03:32:25,600
lying about a rather important detail

4005
03:32:25,600 --> 03:32:27,600
relating to drama. Surely, it was obvious

4006
03:32:27,600 --> 03:32:29,600
that this was a pattern.

4007
03:32:29,600 --> 03:32:31,600
This channel called

4008
03:32:31,600 --> 03:32:33,600
Psych In Real Life, they did how Frenemies

4009
03:32:33,600 --> 03:32:35,600
reveals a mental health misconception

4010
03:32:35,600 --> 03:32:37,600
perpetuated by the internet. This was a really good one.

4011
03:32:37,600 --> 03:32:39,600
This was someone who was in our favour.

4012
03:32:39,600 --> 03:32:41,600
Some people are in our favour that we

4013
03:32:41,600 --> 03:32:43,600
show the ugly side of BBT.

4014
03:32:43,600 --> 03:32:45,600
They're like, you know what? Everyone's a mental health

4015
03:32:45,600 --> 03:32:47,600
advocate until it's ugly, and so...

4016
03:32:47,600 --> 03:32:49,600
So another theory

4017
03:32:49,600 --> 03:32:51,600
began to arise, and although I don't think

4018
03:32:51,600 --> 03:32:53,600
it's the most popular one, I think it's worth

4019
03:32:53,600 --> 03:32:55,600
addressing nonetheless, particularly given the

4020
03:32:55,600 --> 03:32:57,600
undercurrents of mental health. As discussed

4021
03:32:57,600 --> 03:32:59,600
earlier, many felt that given Trisha's noted

4022
03:32:59,600 --> 03:33:01,600
instability, responsibility ultimately fell on

4023
03:33:01,600 --> 03:33:03,600
Ethan for platforming them in the first place.

4024
03:33:03,600 --> 03:33:05,600
While the initial appeals of Frenemies was

4025
03:33:05,600 --> 03:33:07,600
that Trisha Paytas was such an interesting

4026
03:33:07,600 --> 03:33:09,600
character, and that they often lacked a filter,

4027
03:33:09,600 --> 03:33:11,600
and would say stuff that people do deem offensive,

4028
03:33:11,600 --> 03:33:13,600
Trisha never deviated from how they were

4029
03:33:13,600 --> 03:33:15,600
known to behave, so why was it fair to

4030
03:33:15,600 --> 03:33:17,600
treat them any other way? I think the

4031
03:33:17,600 --> 03:33:19,600
problem is that this ultimately arose

4032
03:33:19,600 --> 03:33:21,600
from the desire to keep the podcast together.

4033
03:33:21,600 --> 03:33:23,600
Friendly bias, and some of Dr. Drew's

4034
03:33:23,600 --> 03:33:25,600
less helpful advice. Ethan did obviously

4035
03:33:25,600 --> 03:33:27,600
treat Trisha differently when they were a part

4036
03:33:27,600 --> 03:33:29,600
of the podcast. Although he was no pushover,

4037
03:33:29,600 --> 03:33:31,600
he didn't really treat Trisha's worst

4038
03:33:31,600 --> 03:33:33,600
comments with the seriousness that they could have

4039
03:33:33,600 --> 03:33:35,600
been treated as a critic, or even

4040
03:33:35,600 --> 03:33:37,600
as a friend, and some would even say that

4041
03:33:37,600 --> 03:33:39,600
he almost left people to observe it like a

4042
03:33:39,600 --> 03:33:41,600
specimen under a microscope. It was

4043
03:33:41,600 --> 03:33:43,600
part of the theatre, it could easily blur

4044
03:33:43,600 --> 03:33:45,600
the lines between melodrama and serious

4045
03:33:45,600 --> 03:33:47,600
disputes. In the months after, it

4046
03:33:47,600 --> 03:33:49,600
became easy to view what seemed like

4047
03:33:49,600 --> 03:33:51,600
melodrama at the time in a much more serious

4048
03:33:51,600 --> 03:33:53,600
light, and many did, but losing

4049
03:33:53,600 --> 03:33:55,600
perspective of the original context they were

4050
03:33:55,600 --> 03:33:57,600
viewed in. Exposing Trisha Paytas

4051
03:33:57,600 --> 03:33:59,600
is such a strange concept because everyone

4052
03:33:59,600 --> 03:34:01,600
knows so much

4053
03:34:01,600 --> 03:34:03,600
and so little about them at the same time,

4054
03:34:03,600 --> 03:34:05,600
and I don't know what you

4055
03:34:05,600 --> 03:34:07,600
could say about Trisha Paytas

4056
03:34:07,600 --> 03:34:09,600
that would surprise me. I spoke

4057
03:34:09,600 --> 03:34:11,600
earlier about Ethan's bias, and I think it's

4058
03:34:11,600 --> 03:34:13,600
what made him a contentious figure.

4059
03:34:13,600 --> 03:34:15,600
During the Keemstar Girlfriend drama, a clip

4060
03:34:15,600 --> 03:34:17,600
began to circulate of what he said to Boogie,

4061
03:34:17,600 --> 03:34:19,600
another creator on the older side who'd had

4062
03:34:19,600 --> 03:34:21,600
an interaction with a younger girl, and Ethan's

4063
03:34:21,600 --> 03:34:23,600
supposedly differing perspective.

4064
03:34:51,600 --> 03:34:59,600
Now this

4065
03:34:59,600 --> 03:35:01,600
once again harkens back to the hypocrisy

4066
03:35:01,600 --> 03:35:03,600
narrative that many assert, however I think

4067
03:35:03,600 --> 03:35:05,600
it more shows how often Ethan projects his

4068
03:35:05,600 --> 03:35:07,600
judgement of character onto an action

4069
03:35:07,600 --> 03:35:09,600
that many others may refrain from making assumptions

4070
03:35:09,600 --> 03:35:11,600
about. Ethan believes that Keemstar

4071
03:35:11,600 --> 03:35:13,600
is an inherently opportunistic, shady

4072
03:35:13,600 --> 03:35:15,600
individual, probably many worse words,

4073
03:35:15,600 --> 03:35:17,600
and therefore, from Ethan's perspective,

4074
03:35:17,600 --> 03:35:19,600
Keem's attraction to younger adults

4075
03:35:19,600 --> 03:35:21,600
is based on something more insidious than if it

4076
03:35:21,600 --> 03:35:23,600
was an action carried out by someone he had more

4077
03:35:23,600 --> 03:35:25,600
respect for. The only issue is that Ethan

4078
03:35:25,600 --> 03:35:27,600
often doesn't elaborate on this himself

4079
03:35:27,600 --> 03:35:29,600
and uses general logic that could be

4080
03:35:29,600 --> 03:35:31,600
applied to any of these situations, and

4081
03:35:31,600 --> 03:35:33,600
therefore, for people who don't think it's fair to

4082
03:35:33,600 --> 03:35:35,600
cross-apply those assumptions, these positions

4083
03:35:35,600 --> 03:35:37,600
will seem conflicting. I think

4084
03:35:37,600 --> 03:35:39,600
the Trisha fallout showed that friend-enemy

4085
03:35:39,600 --> 03:35:41,600
dichotomy that Ethan clearly experienced,

4086
03:35:41,600 --> 03:35:43,600
and in a way, it makes sense,

4087
03:35:43,600 --> 03:35:45,600
someone who you may perceive charitably may have

4088
03:35:45,600 --> 03:35:47,600
their faux pas viewed as requiring

4089
03:35:47,600 --> 03:35:49,600
education. However, if you come to the conclusion

4090
03:35:49,600 --> 03:35:51,600
that actually that person is not well-meaning,

4091
03:35:51,600 --> 03:35:53,600
then you may think that they already have the

4092
03:35:53,600 --> 03:35:55,600
education, they're just discarding it.

4093
03:35:55,600 --> 03:35:57,600
With that said, it is a distinct polarity,

4094
03:35:57,600 --> 03:35:59,600
and although some would say that Trisha

4095
03:35:59,600 --> 03:36:01,600
certainly poked Ethan until he bit back,

4096
03:36:01,600 --> 03:36:03,600
others would argue he unquestionably gave a platform

4097
03:36:03,600 --> 03:36:05,600
for a person who was known for their falsehoods

4098
03:36:05,600 --> 03:36:07,600
and then adopted a victimhood narrative

4099
03:36:07,600 --> 03:36:09,600
when those falsehoods were turned against him.

4100
03:36:09,600 --> 03:36:11,600
It's not hard to wonder if the famous

4101
03:36:11,600 --> 03:36:13,600
episode 17 would have even been

4102
03:36:13,600 --> 03:36:15,600
considered for deletion if friend-enemies never

4103
03:36:15,600 --> 03:36:17,600
split up. As we've seen, it's very difficult

4104
03:36:17,600 --> 03:36:19,600
to use Trisha's words against them

4105
03:36:19,600 --> 03:36:21,600
because you don't know what's real and what isn't.

4106
03:36:21,600 --> 03:36:23,600
The truth is, no viewer or audience member

4107
03:36:23,600 --> 03:36:25,600
will ever truly know who Trisha

4108
03:36:25,600 --> 03:36:27,600
Paytas is or what they believe, because they

4109
03:36:27,600 --> 03:36:29,600
throw out so many statements that makes me question

4110
03:36:29,600 --> 03:36:31,600
if they know what they believe themselves

4111
03:36:31,600 --> 03:36:33,600
half the time. With this in mind, I think

4112
03:36:33,600 --> 03:36:35,600
some commentators and critics of

4113
03:36:35,600 --> 03:36:37,600
Klein and their fanbase found the long-term

4114
03:36:37,600 --> 03:36:39,600
reaction to the collapse of friend-enemies

4115
03:36:39,600 --> 03:36:41,600
slightly inauthentic. Trisha had

4116
03:36:41,600 --> 03:36:43,600
alluded to this narrative as well, regularly

4117
03:36:43,600 --> 03:36:45,600
claiming people only cared about certain

4118
03:36:45,600 --> 03:36:47,600
actions after they were antagonized by

4119
03:36:47,600 --> 03:36:49,600
the audience, and although somewhat inaccurate

4120
03:36:49,600 --> 03:36:51,600
I can understand the gist of it.

4121
03:36:51,600 --> 03:36:53,600
In essence, they're saying people like Ethan

4122
03:36:53,600 --> 03:36:55,600
only wanted the drama, only wanted

4123
03:36:55,600 --> 03:36:57,600
the controversy, only wanted

4124
03:36:57,600 --> 03:36:59,600
the tea and the hot takes as long as

4125
03:36:59,600 --> 03:37:01,600
Trisha was part of the podcast. Ethan

4126
03:37:01,600 --> 03:37:03,600
isn't stupid, and he's very outspoken about

4127
03:37:03,600 --> 03:37:05,600
the people he doesn't like and thinks should probably

4128
03:37:05,600 --> 03:37:07,600
be deplatformed for their behaviour, such as

4129
03:37:07,600 --> 03:37:09,600
Keemstar. Although these two did one

4130
03:37:09,600 --> 03:37:11,600
episode actually a very long time ago, Ethan

4131
03:37:11,600 --> 03:37:13,600
has repeatedly refused to share a

4132
03:37:13,600 --> 03:37:15,600
platform with him since, citing Keem's

4133
03:37:15,600 --> 03:37:17,600
behaviour as examples for why.

4134
03:37:17,600 --> 03:37:19,600
Some would argue that much of the stuff

4135
03:37:19,600 --> 03:37:21,600
that Trisha had done prior to the podcast

4136
03:37:21,600 --> 03:37:23,600
was no less concerning, yet they were

4137
03:37:23,600 --> 03:37:25,600
still taken on. How come?

4138
03:37:41,600 --> 03:37:43,600
Like, I get why he would think

4139
03:37:43,600 --> 03:37:45,600
that, you know what I mean? Because it's like

4140
03:37:45,600 --> 03:37:47,600
every week, you know, it's like I

4141
03:37:47,600 --> 03:37:49,600
have, I'm transgender, I'm just

4142
03:37:49,600 --> 03:37:51,600
I have personality disorder

4143
03:37:51,600 --> 03:37:53,600
and so people start to

4144
03:37:53,600 --> 03:37:55,600
think like, what is

4145
03:37:55,600 --> 03:37:57,600
really going on here? I get it.

4146
03:37:57,600 --> 03:37:59,600
I'm not mad about it, but Anthony Padilla of all

4147
03:37:59,600 --> 03:38:01,600
people, Mr. Fucking Woke, if there's

4148
03:38:01,600 --> 03:38:03,600
something wrong with someone, which there clearly is, let's say

4149
03:38:03,600 --> 03:38:05,600
I am, let's say I have a pathological liar

4150
03:38:05,600 --> 03:38:07,600
and there's some fucking disorder where I'm just like always needing

4151
03:38:07,600 --> 03:38:09,600
attention, like I have something wrong with me,

4152
03:38:09,600 --> 03:38:11,600
don't fucking attack someone because something's wrong, how about

4153
03:38:11,600 --> 03:38:13,600
get that person fucking help? How about butt out

4154
03:38:13,600 --> 03:38:15,600
because there's probably other people helping. People don't know

4155
03:38:15,600 --> 03:38:17,600
fucking shit when it comes to this stuff.

4156
03:38:17,600 --> 03:38:19,600
Well, I suppose more cynical viewers would assume

4157
03:38:19,600 --> 03:38:21,600
that once again it comes down in part

4158
03:38:21,600 --> 03:38:23,600
to control. Unlike a collaboration

4159
03:38:23,600 --> 03:38:25,600
with Keemstar, for example, Ethan had

4160
03:38:25,600 --> 03:38:27,600
an idea of how a podcast with Trisha could

4161
03:38:27,600 --> 03:38:29,600
go. He had relative control of it on his

4162
03:38:29,600 --> 03:38:31,600
platform, and at the time there was a notion

4163
03:38:31,600 --> 03:38:33,600
of that greater evil for both parties

4164
03:38:33,600 --> 03:38:35,600
to combat. Trisha did what Trisha was

4165
03:38:35,600 --> 03:38:37,600
brought on to do, and people catered to them,

4166
03:38:37,600 --> 03:38:39,600
and supported them, and although there were conflicts,

4167
03:38:39,600 --> 03:38:41,600
they were regularly brought back not too long after

4168
03:38:41,600 --> 03:38:43,600
with the expectation that if Trisha could be

4169
03:38:43,600 --> 03:38:45,600
kept happy, the podcast would continue.

4170
03:38:45,600 --> 03:38:47,600
Some might even say that Trisha's behaviour

4171
03:38:47,600 --> 03:38:49,600
was enabled by an environment that valued

4172
03:38:49,600 --> 03:38:51,600
their presence over the actual truth,

4173
03:38:51,600 --> 03:38:53,600
despite the fact that this contradictory evidence

4174
03:38:53,600 --> 03:38:55,600
was available during many of the discussions

4175
03:38:55,600 --> 03:38:57,600
they held. Trisha is an

4176
03:38:57,600 --> 03:38:59,600
autonomous adult, and therefore has to bear some

4177
03:38:59,600 --> 03:39:01,600
responsibilities for their statements. However,

4178
03:39:01,600 --> 03:39:03,600
if their inconsistency has been as consistent

4179
03:39:03,600 --> 03:39:05,600
as it's made out to be, some would claim

4180
03:39:05,600 --> 03:39:07,600
that Ethan isn't as innocent as people

4181
03:39:07,600 --> 03:39:09,600
might assume, that he must have had some awareness

4182
03:39:09,600 --> 03:39:11,600
of what he signed himself up for,

4183
03:39:11,600 --> 03:39:13,600
but didn't mind as long as he had control

4184
03:39:13,600 --> 03:39:15,600
of the environment that Trisha existed in,

4185
03:39:15,600 --> 03:39:17,600
as long as the narrative was on his side.

4186
03:39:17,600 --> 03:39:19,600
I do have a premonition

4187
03:39:19,600 --> 03:39:21,600
that I'm like, I feel like I'm gonna be like a Jimmy Fallon

4188
03:39:21,600 --> 03:39:23,600
and I'm gonna just have to leave this show and I feel bad

4189
03:39:23,600 --> 03:39:25,600
because you're so nice to me.

4190
03:39:25,600 --> 03:39:27,600
You're gonna move up,

4191
03:39:27,600 --> 03:39:29,600
you're gonna ascend to late night

4192
03:39:29,600 --> 03:39:31,600
and say, Ethan, I'm sorry,

4193
03:39:33,600 --> 03:39:35,600
we've had a good thing,

4194
03:39:35,600 --> 03:39:37,600
but I have to leave you behind.

4195
03:39:37,600 --> 03:39:39,600
Eventually we're gonna have to part ways, and when is that gonna happen

4196
03:39:39,600 --> 03:39:41,600
and what's gonna happen, like I'll feel bad if that's you

4197
03:39:41,600 --> 03:39:43,600
like what if, you know what I mean?

4198
03:39:43,600 --> 03:39:45,600
I'm pretty content,

4199
03:39:45,600 --> 03:39:47,600
I'm not looking to move up anywhere.

4200
03:39:47,600 --> 03:39:49,600
That's the problem with me,

4201
03:39:49,600 --> 03:39:51,600
I'm never content, I always think I'm gonna be doing better

4202
03:39:51,600 --> 03:39:53,600
and bigger things.

4203
03:39:53,600 --> 03:39:55,600
Some would always believe that Ethan just wanted to use

4204
03:39:55,600 --> 03:39:57,600
Trisha's controversial persona for the click based on the views,

4205
03:39:57,600 --> 03:39:59,600
without real regard for the place

4206
03:39:59,600 --> 03:40:01,600
that Trisha's inconsistencies and outbursts

4207
03:40:01,600 --> 03:40:03,600
came from. And although Trisha did consent,

4208
03:40:03,600 --> 03:40:05,600
was Trisha too in love with the attention

4209
03:40:05,600 --> 03:40:07,600
to even process the situation rationally?

4210
03:40:07,600 --> 03:40:09,600
Was it really responsible to provide

4211
03:40:09,600 --> 03:40:11,600
them with that space anyway?

4212
03:40:11,600 --> 03:40:13,600
Maybe Ethan only wanted Trisha for as long

4213
03:40:13,600 --> 03:40:15,600
as they played the part they wanted,

4214
03:40:15,600 --> 03:40:17,600
and the moment they attempted to take more control

4215
03:40:17,600 --> 03:40:19,600
was the moment they were no longer useful.

4216
03:40:19,600 --> 03:40:21,600
This is all just speculation,

4217
03:40:21,600 --> 03:40:23,600
and a reflection of how people view

4218
03:40:23,600 --> 03:40:25,600
the situation quite cynically.

4219
03:40:25,600 --> 03:40:27,600
And I want to make that click,

4220
03:40:27,600 --> 03:40:29,600
but it often did latch onto one key factor

4221
03:40:29,600 --> 03:40:31,600
of the podcast, particularly one with

4222
03:40:31,600 --> 03:40:33,600
such notable personalities,

4223
03:40:33,600 --> 03:40:35,600
and that is control.

4224
03:40:35,600 --> 03:40:37,600
So what did that control come down to?

4225
03:40:37,600 --> 03:40:39,600
Well, one statistic springs

4226
03:40:39,600 --> 03:40:41,600
to mind.

4227
03:41:09,600 --> 03:41:11,600
Okay, fine. And so we had to buy

4228
03:41:11,600 --> 03:41:13,600
But that was the first time we ever spent money on production costs.

4229
03:41:13,600 --> 03:41:15,600
It's not about that, dude.

4230
03:41:15,600 --> 03:41:17,600
It's literally about we are producing the show

4231
03:41:17,600 --> 03:41:19,600
and I'm taking a cut. I feel like that's

4232
03:41:19,600 --> 03:41:21,600
beyond reasonable.

4233
03:41:21,600 --> 03:41:23,600
Beyond reasonable.

4234
03:41:23,600 --> 03:41:25,600
5%. Do you realize how much 5% was of our last one?

4235
03:41:25,600 --> 03:41:43,600
As said, it's very hard to distinguish Trisha's true beliefs from the ones they push for provocative purposes.

4236
03:41:43,600 --> 03:41:47,600
There was one situation which I do feel represented Trisha's opinions from a fairly genuine perspective,

4237
03:41:47,600 --> 03:41:51,600
as it was one where their behaviour didn't benefit this arc of attention.

4238
03:41:51,600 --> 03:41:53,600
That is arguably the most memed issue of it all,

4239
03:41:53,600 --> 03:41:55,600
the 5% and what it represented.

4240
03:41:55,600 --> 03:41:59,600
Although Trisha is a person who often isn't completely honest with what they think or how they feel,

4241
03:41:59,600 --> 03:42:01,600
it's never without a greater motive,

4242
03:42:01,600 --> 03:42:03,600
and in absence of a trolling motive,

4243
03:42:03,600 --> 03:42:05,600
we have to ask ourselves,

4244
03:42:05,600 --> 03:42:07,600
what is so important about 5%?

4245
03:42:07,600 --> 03:42:09,600
In her whole family,

4246
03:42:09,600 --> 03:42:11,600
it's like they're all just sitting there counting the 5%.

4247
03:42:11,600 --> 03:42:13,600
It takes that 5%.

4248
03:42:13,600 --> 03:42:15,600
You got her whole family, you're just like,

4249
03:42:15,600 --> 03:42:17,600
the 5%.

4250
03:42:17,600 --> 03:42:19,600
That's a small number!

4251
03:42:19,600 --> 03:42:21,600
1, 2, 3, 4, 5!

4252
03:42:21,600 --> 03:42:23,600
Out of 100!

4253
03:42:23,600 --> 03:42:25,600
So 100 numbers, that's 5 of them!

4254
03:42:25,600 --> 03:42:29,600
Now the quotes and jokes run deep, and rightfully so.

4255
03:42:29,600 --> 03:42:31,600
I don't think there's anyone who believes that with the production costs,

4256
03:42:31,600 --> 03:42:35,600
Trisha and Ethan's profits should have been split completely evenly.

4257
03:42:35,600 --> 03:42:39,600
However, I do think the banter has often clouded the core points that were trying to be made,

4258
03:42:39,600 --> 03:42:41,600
but weren't completely unfounded.

4259
03:42:41,600 --> 03:42:43,600
It also reflects the ultimate flaw in the structure of Frenemies,

4260
03:42:43,600 --> 03:42:45,600
and the dynamic between Ethan and Trisha.

4261
03:42:45,600 --> 03:42:49,600
Both parties purported a sense of betrayal when discussing the capitulation of the partnership,

4262
03:42:49,600 --> 03:42:53,600
but they both gave a lot to be on the podcast before being thrown under the bus by the other,

4263
03:42:53,600 --> 03:42:58,600
and maybe this was because that in later episodes they seemed to become much more comfortable with each other.

4264
03:42:58,600 --> 03:43:00,600
Trisha was invited on the podcast by Ethan,

4265
03:43:00,600 --> 03:43:03,600
with Ethan owning all the production resources and investing in it himself.

4266
03:43:03,600 --> 03:43:05,600
Therefore, although it was hosted by both of them,

4267
03:43:05,600 --> 03:43:09,600
there was the steadying hand of Ethan to keep the show afloat under all circumstances,

4268
03:43:09,600 --> 03:43:12,600
which made sense given Trisha's unpredictable tendencies,

4269
03:43:12,600 --> 03:43:16,600
however it also meant that Trisha was almost always a guest on their own podcast.

4270
03:43:16,600 --> 03:43:19,600
Although their outbursts often resulted in certain concessions,

4271
03:43:19,600 --> 03:43:22,600
it also reminded people that their presence was still unreliable,

4272
03:43:22,600 --> 03:43:25,600
and didn't give them any stead to expect more control over production.

4273
03:43:25,600 --> 03:43:29,600
However, 35 episodes in, and half a year since the last serious quarrel,

4274
03:43:29,600 --> 03:43:35,600
I think Trisha believed that they had become enough of a mainstay to expect a bit more authority over the direction of the podcast.

4275
03:43:35,600 --> 03:43:37,600
The girl that he cheated on with is Ava Louise Girl.

4276
03:43:37,600 --> 03:43:40,600
He called her a gremlin. It's like, you fucked her.

4277
03:43:40,600 --> 03:43:41,600
Go off, Queen.

4278
03:43:41,600 --> 03:43:42,600
You can't fuck- I hate- I hate-

4279
03:43:42,600 --> 03:43:43,600
Go the fuck off.

4280
03:43:43,600 --> 03:43:45,600
Guys fuck girls, and because they got caught or whatever,

4281
03:43:45,600 --> 03:43:47,600
then they call the girl the gremlin and stuff like that,

4282
03:43:47,600 --> 03:43:51,600
like, oh, she was good enough to suck your dick, like what are you talk- Mike is such a woman hater,

4283
03:43:51,600 --> 03:43:52,600
and he hates sex workers.

4284
03:43:52,600 --> 03:43:53,600
Go off. Go off.

4285
03:43:53,600 --> 03:43:55,600
You can see this by Lana, he's cheated on her,

4286
03:43:55,600 --> 03:43:58,600
he's like publicly admitted to it in a game, saying he got head from people,

4287
03:43:58,600 --> 03:43:59,600
like he's so- he-

4288
03:43:59,600 --> 03:44:00,600
Oh, you know what?

4289
03:44:00,600 --> 03:44:04,600
This is the kind of guy that virtual reality has to get head from somebody

4290
03:44:04,600 --> 03:44:06,600
over in fucking Florida or wherever the fuck they are.

4291
03:44:06,600 --> 03:44:07,600
Go off.

4292
03:44:07,600 --> 03:44:10,600
And thinking that's cool, like, oh yeah, baby, give me- like, you are such a loser.

4293
03:44:10,600 --> 03:44:11,600
You fucked up, Mike.

4294
03:44:11,600 --> 03:44:14,600
You are some perfect example of small dick energy that you need a virtual person to suck your dick.

4295
03:44:14,600 --> 03:44:16,600
You psychopath.

4296
03:44:16,600 --> 03:44:20,600
It's no secret that they read the comments, and reception had really turned in the prior months.

4297
03:44:20,600 --> 03:44:21,600
One issue remained, though.

4298
03:44:21,600 --> 03:44:23,600
How are they to bring up this point of discourse?

4299
03:44:23,600 --> 03:44:27,600
Well, Trisha has a way of not bringing up specifically what they want,

4300
03:44:27,600 --> 03:44:32,600
rather pushing discussion in a direction that will eventually result in their desirable proposition.

4301
03:44:32,600 --> 03:44:35,600
In that final episode, it was a problem that clearly bothered them,

4302
03:44:35,600 --> 03:44:37,600
which is why they attacked the production aspect,

4303
03:44:37,600 --> 03:44:41,600
eventually escalating the situation to the point where the episode ended prematurely.

4304
03:44:41,600 --> 03:44:46,600
However, the 5% narrative in my mind was Trisha's logical entry point to this discussion,

4305
03:44:46,600 --> 03:44:48,600
and a clear signifier of what they wanted.

4306
03:44:48,600 --> 03:44:52,600
Basically, Trisha's point was that, as it wasn't 50-50 exactly,

4307
03:44:52,600 --> 03:44:57,600
because that 5% came from their own share, they deserved more influence in the decisions being made.

4308
03:44:57,600 --> 03:45:00,600
Ultimately, I disagree with this specific line of logic,

4309
03:45:00,600 --> 03:45:05,600
and I think you have to look more at the share from the perspective that this 5% was nobody's money to begin with.

4310
03:45:05,600 --> 03:45:09,600
However, I also think there was a case to be made for Trisha to have more of a say in certain decisions,

4311
03:45:09,600 --> 03:45:12,600
regardless of the money, because Frenemies was presented as a joint project,

4312
03:45:12,600 --> 03:45:14,600
and they were part of the appeal,

4313
03:45:14,600 --> 03:45:18,600
but that discussion didn't happen because of how Trisha subsequently handled it.

4314
03:45:18,600 --> 03:45:22,600
Now, the tinfoil hat guy in me would question how much of Trisha's outburst was calculated,

4315
03:45:22,600 --> 03:45:25,600
and I really can't say for certain in that case.

4316
03:45:25,600 --> 03:45:30,600
However, I would go as far to say that I think their announcement to step down was done with almost the opposite intent.

4317
03:45:30,600 --> 03:45:34,600
With people's desire to keep the podcast together, and the result of previous tantrums,

4318
03:45:34,600 --> 03:45:40,600
Trisha had every reason to believe that actually them standing down would prompt Ethan to do everything he could to keep the podcast together,

4319
03:45:40,600 --> 03:45:46,600
possibly having another Dr Drew episode which results in Drew recommending Trisha has more representation on the podcast,

4320
03:45:46,600 --> 03:45:50,600
and Ethan abiding by the expert advice. However, that did not happen.

4321
03:45:50,600 --> 03:45:56,600
The 5%, as amusing as it was, became that primary narrative to show that from Trisha's perspective,

4322
03:45:56,600 --> 03:46:01,600
they never really had any control, and for a podcast that they featured on, in their eyes that wasn't fair.

4323
03:46:01,600 --> 03:46:06,600
In my opinion, Trisha didn't want the extra 5%, they just wanted what it represented.

4324
03:46:06,600 --> 03:46:11,600
In the videos following the collapse of the podcast, Trisha emphasised that from their perspective their input wasn't valued enough,

4325
03:46:11,600 --> 03:46:17,600
and although certain points they made were contradicted pretty directly, once again bringing that intent into question,

4326
03:46:17,600 --> 03:46:22,600
I do think there was a tension that neither of them wanted to address until after they didn't have an obligation to each other.

4327
03:46:22,600 --> 03:46:27,600
Both Trisha and Ethan sought to emphasise how much they cared about each other, and I don't doubt that's true,

4328
03:46:27,600 --> 03:46:30,600
but I guess the question would be how much did they trust each other?

4329
03:46:30,600 --> 03:46:33,600
One clip from Ethan's video in particular seems quite relevant.

4330
03:46:33,600 --> 03:46:43,600
So she wants me to hire people, lease in industrial space, of which, by the way, the leases are usually 3 plus years on industrial spaces,

4331
03:46:43,600 --> 03:46:51,600
for something that she's inevitably gonna quit. Like, I mean, it's happened 3 times already, so like,

4332
03:46:51,600 --> 03:46:55,600
and guess who's gonna take all the risk on that? Me. I'm gonna risk my ass.

4333
03:46:55,600 --> 03:47:00,600
Here he states he didn't want to hand over more authority to Trisha in the say of the staff because from his perspective,

4334
03:47:00,600 --> 03:47:04,600
he was the anchor, and Trisha could walk out at any time without experiencing any repercussions.

4335
03:47:04,600 --> 03:47:11,600
This is true, but in a way he walks himself into cyclical reasoning, because what he says is only true because Trisha walked out

4336
03:47:11,600 --> 03:47:16,600
because of that specific reason, in which case Trisha would just reply, well that's where the 5% of my cut comes in.

4337
03:47:16,600 --> 03:47:21,600
Now as said, I don't necessarily agree with Trisha that a cut should give them a stronger say, necessarily,

4338
03:47:21,600 --> 03:47:26,600
I think it's much more to do with trust, but in this case all you do is prove that you ultimately didn't trust them,

4339
03:47:26,600 --> 03:47:31,600
and you can turn around and say, well they walked out, which proves that I shouldn't have given them a greater input anyway,

4340
03:47:31,600 --> 03:47:36,600
but if they walked out on the basis of that specific issue, then it doesn't really prove your point,

4341
03:47:36,600 --> 03:47:40,600
because Trisha would continuously push the idea that they were prepared to take more responsibility,

4342
03:47:40,600 --> 03:47:45,600
and that Klein would not grant them that. That was the significance of the 5% in their mind.

4343
03:47:45,600 --> 03:47:50,600
As noted earlier, there were some who found Trisha's nature to compare themselves with Ila Klein concerting,

4344
03:47:50,600 --> 03:47:53,600
some even going as far to suggest that Trisha was concealing feelings for Ethan themselves.

4345
03:47:54,600 --> 03:48:00,600
I wouldn't say that, but what I would say is that Ethan and Ila were able to launch the H3 podcast with the mutual trust

4346
03:48:00,600 --> 03:48:05,600
that a married couple would invest in themselves. I think Trisha wanted that feeling of partnership as well,

4347
03:48:05,600 --> 03:48:10,600
they wanted that even split, even leadership, even management, even power, ultimately though deep down

4348
03:48:10,600 --> 03:48:15,600
they knew that wasn't something that Ethan would ever be prepared to provide, and that just exposed those doubts once more,

4349
03:48:15,600 --> 03:48:21,600
and how they interpreted them. The core disagreement was this, Trisha clearly believed that Frenemies had outgrown

4350
03:48:21,600 --> 03:48:26,600
the platform of H3, and that it ultimately needed its own space to blossom. This was a discussion that needed

4351
03:48:26,600 --> 03:48:32,600
to be had openly and honestly, instead it came down to one number. That number wasn't important as a singular statistic,

4352
03:48:32,600 --> 03:48:37,600
but more for what it meant to Trisha, the fact that there would always be that difference between them,

4353
03:48:37,600 --> 03:48:42,600
that neither party was completely ready to trust the other, neither quite possessed that faith.

4354
03:48:51,600 --> 03:49:05,600
This is a serious message to everybody watching my update right now, peace and love, peace and love.

4355
03:49:05,600 --> 03:49:11,600
Again, with peace and love, and I mean this with peace and love, peace and love, peace and love, peace and love,

4356
03:49:11,600 --> 03:49:15,600
can you um, can you soundbite, I'm warning you with peace and love?

4357
03:49:15,600 --> 03:49:19,600
Peace and love, it's a phrase you heard a lot on the H3 Podcast and Frenemies.

4358
03:49:19,600 --> 03:49:23,600
It was first said by Ringo Starr, but quickly garnered meme status on the H3 Podcast.

4359
03:49:23,600 --> 03:49:27,600
At first it merely held meme status, but eventually it evolved into something greater.

4360
03:49:27,600 --> 03:49:30,600
Just don't eat the crust, why are you hating on the end?

4361
03:49:30,600 --> 03:49:35,600
Mmm, I think it's a way to keep skinny, Dolly Parton once said she only eats the first bite and not the last bite.

4362
03:49:35,600 --> 03:49:37,600
With peace and love it's not working.

4363
03:49:37,600 --> 03:49:44,600
I have lost three pounds this week, thank you very much, and guess what, I just ate the last bite.

4364
03:49:45,600 --> 03:49:49,600
With peace and love it's not working for you either, whatever you're doing, and you're working out.

4365
03:49:49,600 --> 03:49:51,600
I'm not even working out, and I'm skinnier than you.

4366
03:49:51,600 --> 03:49:55,600
Listen, I'm not calling you fat, I'm just saying.

4367
03:49:55,600 --> 03:50:02,600
Over time peace and love became a way to contextualise or mitigate a possible disparaging remark or negative statement in good faith.

4368
03:50:02,600 --> 03:50:08,600
Although not a method I would typically employ, I understand that some, especially Trisha, may have found that reassuring.

4369
03:50:08,600 --> 03:50:13,600
The problem is that eventually it begins to tire as a technique, particularly when sometimes it feels difficult to fully present something

4370
03:50:13,600 --> 03:50:16,600
as coming from a place of peace and love.

4371
03:50:16,600 --> 03:50:26,600
And so I say with peace and love that, you know, as a friend I have come to love and appreciate Trisha.

4372
03:50:26,600 --> 03:50:31,600
It's hard to do that when reflecting on her falling out publicly, and Trisha immediately uploading videos, tweets,

4373
03:50:31,600 --> 03:50:35,600
and everything under the sun about how they felt placed everyone else on the back foot.

4374
03:50:35,600 --> 03:50:39,600
Ethan was completely in his right to respond. Although it was a solid response in many ways,

4375
03:50:39,600 --> 03:50:44,600
there was also a sense of vexation at the fact that he had tolerated so much of Trisha's behaviour this time round,

4376
03:50:44,600 --> 03:50:46,600
and yet still ended up in the same position.

4377
03:50:46,600 --> 03:50:52,600
The problem is that when you have that building up, your narrative begins to spiral into that cynical perception of a person's actions.

4378
03:50:52,600 --> 03:50:55,600
Take the issue of Trisha wanting to fire the crew.

4379
03:50:55,600 --> 03:51:02,600
Is that I was talking to the crew like, Trisha wants to, I was like, listen, Trisha wants to hire a new crew.

4380
03:51:02,600 --> 03:51:08,600
Now as noted, Trisha did not say this directly, but I can understand why you'd seem to think that they are implying it.

4381
03:51:08,600 --> 03:51:13,600
Ethan admits he handled this situation incorrectly by paraphrasing Trisha's comments to the crew.

4382
03:51:13,600 --> 03:51:18,600
Javi doesn't actually walk back the notion of Trisha wanting to fire the crew, in fact continuing to mention it throughout the video,

4383
03:51:18,600 --> 03:51:22,600
even stating that Trisha had directly said they wanted to fire the crew.

4384
03:51:22,600 --> 03:51:31,600
If anyone was upset, it's because she said that she wanted to fire everybody and get a new staff that made people uncomfortable.

4385
03:51:31,600 --> 03:51:36,600
The reason they were upset that I misunderstood is because she said she wanted to fire them all.

4386
03:51:36,600 --> 03:51:43,600
Now Ethan is completely entitled to his interpretation of Trisha's comments, and Trisha hadn't done themselves any favours in the previous days,

4387
03:51:43,600 --> 03:51:46,600
but once again, it exuded a lack of faith in Trisha's intent.

4388
03:51:46,600 --> 03:51:51,600
Although Trisha had been unnecessarily rude about the crew, they hadn't explicitly stated that they wanted them fired,

4389
03:51:51,600 --> 03:51:58,600
and continuing to assert this interpretation cements your stance that you believe that their expression of these feelings didn't come from a genuine place.

4390
03:51:58,600 --> 03:52:03,600
Some may say, well he only has this interpretation because of how Trisha had been in the previous days,

4391
03:52:03,600 --> 03:52:07,600
but he asserts that this was his understanding before Frenemies had disbanded.

4392
03:52:07,600 --> 03:52:12,600
The wording of firing is also going to be quite evocative, because it often implies that people are going to be losing their jobs,

4393
03:52:12,600 --> 03:52:19,600
however in this case, as Ethan notes himself, these are people who work other jobs for the podcast, and therefore it was unlikely that this would be the case.

4394
03:52:19,600 --> 03:52:26,600
How did you hire Sam without consulting me? It's like, I'm sorry, this is our business, she's not just working on Frenemies.

4395
03:52:26,600 --> 03:52:30,600
Why do I need to consult you who I hire for my business?

4396
03:52:30,600 --> 03:52:37,600
I don't think his point is completely invalid, but I think it conveys a restrained bitterness that was never spoken about while the podcast felt redeemable,

4397
03:52:37,600 --> 03:52:43,600
which then skews the perspective of that specific case, and obviously causes more subsequent anger from Trisha in their responses.

4398
03:52:43,600 --> 03:52:45,600
He's bringing up running the whole crew list again.

4399
03:52:45,600 --> 03:52:47,600
We fronted the money, we-

4400
03:52:47,600 --> 03:52:50,600
In what world? You have all these receipts, show the fucking receipts Ethan.

4401
03:52:50,600 --> 03:52:55,600
Now, I think its presentation is clearly clouded by Ethan's own feelings about the situation,

4402
03:52:55,600 --> 03:52:59,600
but I do think it does represent that sort of thing that a peace and love tone cannot offset,

4403
03:52:59,600 --> 03:53:04,600
and although I think he had decent grounds to believe that Trisha may have been hinting at hiring a new crew for the podcast,

4404
03:53:04,600 --> 03:53:09,600
I think his representation just showed he hadn't progressed his opinion of Trisha as much as the viewers thought he had.

4405
03:53:09,600 --> 03:53:11,600
It was clear that he still harbored great doubts.

4406
03:53:11,600 --> 03:53:17,600
Trisha was no different either, even though they opened their video expressing love for Ethan that soon disappeared.

4407
03:53:17,600 --> 03:53:22,600
It's interesting he'll show all the DMs except the ones where I say fire the crew or what he said to me the night of things that happened,

4408
03:53:22,600 --> 03:53:24,600
in the order it happened.

4409
03:53:24,600 --> 03:53:29,600
Trisha's video is not the easiest to follow because it's Trisha, but even amongst the numerous anecdotes they can fire off,

4410
03:53:29,600 --> 03:53:33,600
you can tell that these are evident problems, and they've been evident problems for the longest time.

4411
03:53:33,600 --> 03:53:36,600
The whole leaving frenemies situation in itself was a good example,

4412
03:53:36,600 --> 03:53:41,600
but in all honesty, if you just watch back the episodes, there are so many moments where they clearly express hesitancy

4413
03:53:41,600 --> 03:53:47,600
to accept support or the peace and love vibe, likely because they weren't entirely happy with the podcast as it was.

4414
03:53:47,600 --> 03:54:14,600
As noted, I personally find it difficult to write off the idea that Trisha's departure was actually a stunt,

4415
03:54:14,600 --> 03:54:18,600
intended to result in further negotiations for an issue they viewed as present,

4416
03:54:18,600 --> 03:54:24,600
but if anything, they proved that they didn't believe that being honest with Ethan would actually bring about the desired result.

4417
03:54:24,600 --> 03:54:30,600
Instead of patiently talking it out, they believed they had to generate negative attention because they believed that was what Ethan would respond to.

4418
03:54:30,600 --> 03:54:36,600
They didn't trust Ethan, Ethan didn't trust Trisha, and they both clearly had issues but didn't have that open discussion

4419
03:54:36,600 --> 03:54:39,600
because they thought holding it back would prevent more harm.

4420
03:54:40,600 --> 03:55:03,600
In actuality, this only yields further frustration because then the other person has to consider the fact that you never really trusted them as a friend

4421
03:55:03,600 --> 03:55:07,600
and that they were just tolerating your presence for the maintenance of a business partnership.

4422
03:55:08,600 --> 03:55:13,600
Trisha was the worst person to experience that because they often seemed to seek justification for why people hated them,

4423
03:55:13,600 --> 03:55:16,600
which inevitably implanted the narrative that they were only used for views.

4424
03:55:16,600 --> 03:55:20,600
This then spirals and only furthers the bad faith interpretations they have of each other,

4425
03:55:20,600 --> 03:55:27,600
and in the remainder of 2021 we saw attempts from both sides to really twist the knife in because they believed it was the only justified response

4426
03:55:27,600 --> 03:55:31,600
when the other willfully tried to hurt them, far from that peace and love we'd seen before.

4427
03:55:32,600 --> 03:55:36,600
A 40's hour philosophy can only work as much as it's what a person positively responds to,

4428
03:55:36,600 --> 03:55:42,600
and to be honest, sometimes I think Trisha needed more than peace and love, or at least they required a tougher version of it.

4429
03:55:42,600 --> 03:55:49,600
It often represented the eggshells that Ethan felt like he walked on, something that Trisha specifically said they didn't want in messages and later videos.

4430
03:55:49,600 --> 03:55:55,600
However, if it wasn't what they wanted, why did they support it when it was first mentioned by the expert himself?

4431
03:56:01,600 --> 03:56:30,600
Trisha and Ethan really needed, with some private sessions, to talk about what frustrated them with a paid professional to make sure these problems didn't fall over,

4432
03:56:30,600 --> 03:56:33,600
and instead, what they received was this,

4433
03:56:39,600 --> 03:56:41,600
and the podcast suffered for it.

4434
03:56:42,600 --> 03:56:46,600
There's one video that I've refrained from talking about yet, because it may just be the worst of them all.

4435
03:56:46,600 --> 03:56:51,600
During the era where Trisha was attempting to talk about frenemies without doing it on their own channel,

4436
03:56:51,600 --> 03:56:53,600
they went onto a podcast with many people.

4437
03:56:53,600 --> 03:56:58,600
One of these people, though, was Dr. Drew, the former mediating party of previous therapy episodes.

4438
03:56:58,600 --> 03:57:04,600
In this video, when discussing the demise of frenemies, Drew continues to repeat previous narratives that he had imparted so helpfully

4439
03:57:04,600 --> 03:57:10,600
during his appearances on the defunct podcast in question, just with more confidence now that the two had actually parted.

4440
03:57:10,600 --> 03:57:16,600
It's really strange watching the man who was meant to help resolve it almost play into it, and the questionable narratives at hand.

4441
03:57:16,600 --> 03:57:22,600
In a way, I don't think Dr. Drew's core advice is of no use, but the problem is that he takes a lot of what Trisha says at face value,

4442
03:57:22,600 --> 03:57:25,600
and that ultimately nullifies a lot of his conclusions.

4443
03:57:25,600 --> 03:57:30,600
I was repeating them to him to help him understand them, and trying to frame his response to them,

4444
03:57:30,600 --> 03:57:38,600
because he's not the one struggling, although he's in the thing with you, he was evoked by what was going on with you.

4445
03:57:38,600 --> 03:57:43,600
I've already delivered a fair few criticisms of Dr. Drew, but I think with the full context of the face of the podcast,

4446
03:57:43,600 --> 03:57:50,600
we can now see the ramifications of clumsily handled relationship advice by fully understanding the actual problems that Trisha and Ethan seem to perceive.

4447
03:57:51,600 --> 03:57:58,600
The truth is that I'm very grateful for the experience we've had with Frenemies, and all the learning and growing and developing,

4448
03:57:58,600 --> 03:58:02,600
and the amazing growth that our channel has seen as the result of that show.

4449
03:58:02,600 --> 03:58:08,600
I mean, it's been popular and successful beyond what either of us anticipated.

4450
03:58:08,600 --> 03:58:15,600
Trisha wanted to transform the podcast, both they and Kline acknowledged its astounding success and view count in comparison to similar series on the channel.

4451
03:58:15,600 --> 03:58:20,600
Frenemies clearly had a presence in an audience of its own, and Trisha's interpretation to me seemed almost like a child,

4452
03:58:20,600 --> 03:58:25,600
wondering how long they would have to behave before Kline entrusted more responsibility onto them,

4453
03:58:25,600 --> 03:58:29,600
but Kline didn't want to move on that because he didn't want to rely on someone who may not stick around.

4454
03:58:29,600 --> 03:58:32,600
Why is that? Well, Ethan still didn't trust Trisha enough.

4455
03:58:32,600 --> 03:58:37,600
Ethan couldn't predict what Trisha would do and wasn't prepared to put that faith in his own judgement alone,

4456
03:58:37,600 --> 03:58:41,600
and that was something that should have been at least worked on during the two pivotal episodes with Dr. Drew.

4457
03:58:41,600 --> 03:58:47,600
In a perfect world, counselling would enable both parties to find closure, yet acceptance in the differences they hold.

4458
03:58:47,600 --> 03:58:53,600
This doesn't always happen, and for two people as diametrically opposed as Ethan and Trisha, maybe that could never happen.

4459
03:58:53,600 --> 03:58:56,600
However, the insight they received was probably the least helpful it could be.

4460
03:58:56,600 --> 03:59:01,600
It created this normal where problems were swept under the rug in the hope that ultimately the strength of the podcast would prevail,

4461
03:59:01,600 --> 03:59:05,600
but tensions boil over, and bottling up problems will eventually break bonds down.

4462
03:59:05,600 --> 03:59:08,600
There were eggshells that everyone was walking on, too afraid to address them.

4463
03:59:09,600 --> 03:59:12,600
From the beginning, we've always been combative, as opposed to you.

4464
03:59:12,600 --> 03:59:17,600
I know you're always team Trish, as opposed to, again, it's fine, but I know it was to exploit me, right?

4465
03:59:17,600 --> 03:59:21,600
He wanted me to walk off that set that day, so my attitude's different, which is fine.

4466
03:59:21,600 --> 03:59:26,600
I exploit myself, like I said, that's my one entertaining quality for the internet, so I was like, fine, that's fine.

4467
03:59:26,600 --> 03:59:31,600
But it's like, I knew that going into it that he was always trying to do another walk off, you know what I mean?

4468
03:59:31,600 --> 03:59:33,600
So it's a little different as opposed to you.

4469
03:59:33,600 --> 03:59:38,600
In many ways, it told Ethan to essentially seek appeasement for the sake of the podcast's longevity.

4470
03:59:38,600 --> 03:59:43,600
Repression isn't resolution, though, and if you have these apprehensions that persist, you should talk about them,

4471
03:59:43,600 --> 03:59:46,600
even if Trisha may find it upsetting or offensive in the moment.

4472
03:59:46,600 --> 03:59:51,600
In this case, longevity itself is still temporary because eventually these things break down,

4473
03:59:51,600 --> 03:59:57,600
because eventually you lose your patience or the other person picks up on the fact that you're still unsure of where you stand with them,

4474
03:59:57,600 --> 04:00:01,600
and begins to unravel themselves in an attempt to change that, that rollover mentality.

4475
04:00:01,600 --> 04:00:07,600
It showed itself as demonstrably detrimental when Trisha was trying to assert those worst expectations in that final episode,

4476
04:00:07,600 --> 04:00:11,600
because Ethan just went ahead and confirmed it to try and end the argument, to try and move on,

4477
04:00:11,600 --> 04:00:16,600
but sometimes people don't move on until they've cleared something up, until they've repaired that trust.

4478
04:00:16,600 --> 04:00:23,600
Thank you for giving me a third wave. I feel like I've gone through, Shane gave me the first wave, then David, then, oh, we're not falling out.

4479
04:00:23,600 --> 04:00:27,600
Well, we almost did, but we pulled through.

4480
04:00:27,600 --> 04:00:30,600
You're marrying my brother-in-law, so.

4481
04:00:30,600 --> 04:00:31,600
It's like we're stuck.

4482
04:00:31,600 --> 04:00:33,600
Kind of removing the options.

4483
04:00:33,600 --> 04:00:35,600
You haven't f'd your cat or anything.

4484
04:00:35,600 --> 04:00:40,600
I'm not the kind of dude who, like, holds grudges. I like to sell squash beef, especially with people like in my family.

4485
04:00:40,600 --> 04:00:44,600
Trust starts with transparency. Understanding boundaries is an important building block to that.

4486
04:00:44,600 --> 04:00:50,600
Trisha is wildly inconsistent, and hell, it may have been a lost cause to even try and understand what lines they would hypothetically draw,

4487
04:00:50,600 --> 04:00:56,600
but it would have been better than doing nothing at all. At the worst, it would have allowed the podcast to end on a note of mutual agreement,

4488
04:00:56,600 --> 04:01:03,600
something that proved impossible in the current environment, and was only illuminated by their conflicting interpretations of the unaired episode

4489
04:01:03,600 --> 04:01:07,600
where they attempted to settle those. But it wasn't just about Trisha's boundaries.

4490
04:01:07,600 --> 04:01:11,600
I think every single person, every group I've been with, Shane Dawson, David Dobrik, Ethan and his crew,

4491
04:01:11,600 --> 04:01:17,600
like, they're all these guys that are like, oh my god, Trisha's so crazy. Like, what the fuck? She says this crazy stuff, her crazy life.

4492
04:01:17,600 --> 04:01:23,600
Like, candlesticks up her ass, all this stuff. And then as soon as, like, I get triggered by it, it's like, oh, too much.

4493
04:01:23,600 --> 04:01:28,600
Oh, like, she's just a bad person. She uses, like, mental health. It's like, all of a sudden, it's like, you know, it's like, if it's too much,

4494
04:01:28,600 --> 04:01:30,600
they're like, disengage, disengage. It's weird. I don't know.

4495
04:01:30,600 --> 04:01:36,600
There are no two ways about it. The infamous December episode where Trisha loses their temper at Ethan and the absent Eli

4496
04:01:36,600 --> 04:01:42,600
was unacceptable behaviour for anyone, and although their conduct never approached that specific degree of volatility again,

4497
04:01:42,600 --> 04:01:46,600
it should have been outlined that they wouldn't receive the same treatment if that happened next time.

4498
04:01:46,600 --> 04:01:51,600
I think Trisha almost believed their loyalty to the podcast was assumed because drama was naturally inbuilt.

4499
04:01:51,600 --> 04:01:58,600
They repeat this on the Dr Drew podcast, but they continue to focus on that one event, the storming out, and not actually what followed.

4500
04:01:58,600 --> 04:02:03,600
I'm good about this. Okay, let's go through your stupid, I don't like this segment, just for the record, fan advice is a stupid segment.

4501
04:02:04,600 --> 04:02:09,600
I don't think Ethan's greatest issue with Trisha was their on-podcast behaviour in the final episode.

4502
04:02:09,600 --> 04:02:15,600
I think what more pushed him towards the conclusion that the partnership was beyond saving was the DMs that Trisha leaked themselves,

4503
04:02:15,600 --> 04:02:20,600
where they once more lose their cool, and Trisha announcing that they were leaving. However, this probably wouldn't have happened

4504
04:02:20,600 --> 04:02:26,600
if Trisha knew it wasn't going to work. In a couple of other notable instances, Trisha's explosive behaviour had been rewarded

4505
04:02:26,600 --> 04:02:30,600
with a seat at the negotiation table, with a therapist by their side. That didn't happen.

4506
04:02:30,600 --> 04:02:35,600
From my perspective, Ethan felt like he'd done everything to keep Trisha happy, and it still wasn't enough,

4507
04:02:35,600 --> 04:02:40,600
and at that point he decided that there was nothing else he could do, and concluded that accepting Trisha's resignation from the podcast

4508
04:02:40,600 --> 04:02:46,600
was the smartest route. This wasn't the first time that Trisha had said they were quitting, but it was the first time that Ethan rubber-stamped it.

4509
04:02:46,600 --> 04:02:51,600
If there had been an established method in problem resolution beyond just pushing it towards the backburner,

4510
04:02:51,600 --> 04:02:56,600
Trisha may never have considered leaving the podcast as an acceptable course to having their qualms recognised.

4511
04:02:56,600 --> 04:03:01,600
They needed a system for these problems that was mutually acknowledged that if breached, would bring about the show's termination.

4512
04:03:01,600 --> 04:03:07,600
If Trisha did have some form of rationale to their behaviour, then this would at least serve as greater motivation to not act in a way

4513
04:03:07,600 --> 04:03:09,600
that they did after the show's downfall.

4514
04:03:09,600 --> 04:03:32,600
It's very easy to point fingers at people directly involved in the drama, and to be honest, I think there is some responsibility that can be attributed there,

4515
04:03:32,600 --> 04:03:37,600
but I also think that sometimes you need the right guidance, and in this case that could only be provided by a professional therapist

4516
04:03:38,600 --> 04:03:42,600
who didn't have any biases, any priorities, or a public personality to maintain.

4517
04:03:42,600 --> 04:03:47,600
If you put the survival of a podcast above the survival of your friendship, and the openness that you can express in it,

4518
04:03:47,600 --> 04:03:53,600
then the podcast will suffer nonetheless. It is built from that friendship, or frenemyship, not vice versa.

4519
04:03:54,600 --> 04:04:14,600
As much as we can assign blame to subpar vice, it was also Ethan and Trisha's decision to bring Dr Drew on and abide by his wisdom.

4520
04:04:14,600 --> 04:04:19,600
If anything, the presence of a personality like Dr Drew showed that although the drama was personal,

4521
04:04:19,600 --> 04:04:23,600
frenemys were still just a spectacle, and it needed to be more than that to survive.

4522
04:04:34,600 --> 04:04:41,600
When Ethan started the H3 Podcast channel, I think he hoped that it would allow him to present a more unfiltered, authentic version of himself,

4523
04:04:41,600 --> 04:04:45,600
and in a way, he achieved that. However, he also experienced issues expressing that natural self,

4524
04:04:45,600 --> 04:04:50,600
and working it into conversations with other guests, and often getting into drama himself.

4525
04:04:50,600 --> 04:04:55,600
Drama and conflict aside, there was definitely a need to surround himself with people who would play off his best parts,

4526
04:04:55,600 --> 04:05:02,600
and ameliorate his worst. Nowadays he does that pretty successfully with his crew, but back then Trisha was the catalyst to bring H3 into a new era.

4527
04:05:07,600 --> 04:05:12,600
Who would have guessed that a few select comments could spawn such a tumultuous and memorable partnership in the YouTube history books,

4528
04:05:12,600 --> 04:05:16,600
and in many ways they did create something timeless, an experience that many were grateful for.

4529
04:05:16,600 --> 04:05:21,600
Given their characters at the start of the podcast, people really didn't believe it would last more than a few episodes,

4530
04:05:21,600 --> 04:05:25,600
but over time that expectation changed, and the investment manifested as well.

4531
04:05:25,600 --> 04:05:30,600
And for much of the time, the show appeared to undergo an evolution that transformed both Ethan and Trisha,

4532
04:05:30,600 --> 04:05:34,600
moving from a dynamic of tense rivalry to strong camaraderie.

4533
04:05:34,600 --> 04:05:38,600
With that in mind, there was a potential sadness that the podcast couldn't be something greater,

4534
04:05:38,600 --> 04:05:41,600
as it seemed to be progressing in that direction for so long.

4535
04:05:41,600 --> 04:05:47,600
I keep saying I love this show, and everyone just stopped the podcast, I'm like please don't stop this podcast, that's all I got going for.

4536
04:05:47,600 --> 04:05:49,600
Well let me read you what they said.

4537
04:05:49,600 --> 04:05:52,600
Without context, the episodes constructed a poignant story,

4538
04:05:52,600 --> 04:05:57,600
one where Trisha had experienced so much maltreatment and desertion that their own responses were a product of their reception.

4539
04:05:57,600 --> 04:06:02,600
In some ways it seemed like a believable account, particularly given the cannibalistic nature of internet culture,

4540
04:06:02,600 --> 04:06:05,600
and the conviction that Trisha spoke with made it all the more convincing.

4541
04:06:06,600 --> 04:06:12,600
It was an occasionally difficult but very sympathetic portrait of a person who was often judged quite harshly by the internet.

4542
04:06:12,600 --> 04:06:17,600
Additionally, it was a sobering moment for a lot of viewers, and maybe prompted a fair bit of reflection on their behalf.

4543
04:06:17,600 --> 04:06:20,600
However, often the problem with the internet is that it's a pendulum,

4544
04:06:20,600 --> 04:06:23,600
it judges it individually either far too harshly or not at all,

4545
04:06:23,600 --> 04:06:27,600
and in the deluge of sentimentality, some left their better judgement at the door.

4546
04:06:27,600 --> 04:06:31,600
So many were sold on it, and maybe if some had detached themselves a little more,

4547
04:06:31,600 --> 04:06:34,600
they would have picked up on certain lies designed to play up this story.

4548
04:06:34,600 --> 04:06:38,600
I don't think this means that Trisha hasn't suffered in their life, I want to make that clear,

4549
04:06:38,600 --> 04:06:43,600
but I do think they were too committed to it, too committed to a vision in their head that wasn't going to happen.

4550
04:06:43,600 --> 04:06:50,600
Trisha is a person whose words have often held very little impact online because of how notably unreliable and melodramatic they are,

4551
04:06:50,600 --> 04:06:54,600
but Frenemies changed the game for them due to the assumed realism of that podcast environment.

4552
04:06:54,600 --> 04:06:58,600
Unfortunately, although it was in a new format, it was the same old Trish,

4553
04:06:58,600 --> 04:07:01,600
and given they had proven to have lied a fair few times prior,

4554
04:07:01,600 --> 04:07:07,600
including during their debut appearance on the H3 podcast, it was almost impressive they managed to rope people in once more.

4555
04:07:07,600 --> 04:07:14,600
I think in this story, Ethan saw himself in a position where he could be the start of a healthier online relationship for Trisha.

4556
04:07:14,600 --> 04:07:19,600
He really did try to make that difference in their life, but they weren't quite ready to let Ethan in,

4557
04:07:19,600 --> 04:07:24,600
and I think Ethan picked up on that because Trisha knew that the podcast wasn't quite where they wanted it to be.

4558
04:07:24,600 --> 04:07:27,600
Trisha had greater plans for this story, and Ethan didn't.

4559
04:07:27,600 --> 04:07:33,600
I think deep down they both apprehended its collapse, either due to Trisha's own nature or Ethan's response to it,

4560
04:07:33,600 --> 04:07:38,600
and in a way, Ethan's subsequent reaction to Trisha's lashing out helped preserve the abandonment narrative in their mind.

4561
04:07:38,600 --> 04:07:43,600
I think every single person, every group I've been with, Shane Dawson, David Dobrik, Ethan and his crew,

4562
04:07:43,600 --> 04:07:49,600
they're all these guys that are like, oh my gosh, you're just so crazy, what the fuck, she says this crazy stuff, her crazy life,

4563
04:07:49,600 --> 04:07:54,600
like candlesticks up her ass, all this stuff, and then as soon as I get triggered by it, it's like, oh, too much,

4564
04:07:54,600 --> 04:07:59,600
oh, she's just a bad person, she's just mental, it's like, all of a sudden, it's like, you know, if it's too much,

4565
04:07:59,600 --> 04:08:02,600
they're like, disengage, disengage, it's weird, I don't know.

4566
04:08:02,600 --> 04:08:03,600
Right, yeah.

4567
04:08:03,600 --> 04:08:04,600
Then they abandoned it.

4568
04:08:04,600 --> 04:08:05,600
Yeah, exactly.

4569
04:08:05,600 --> 04:08:08,600
The difference is, at that stage, it was Trisha who left the podcast.

4570
04:08:08,600 --> 04:08:14,600
It wasn't Ethan's fault. The one thing that I would say Ethan was unequivocally right to do, though, was to accept the end of the podcast.

4571
04:08:14,600 --> 04:08:20,600
I have my problems with Ethan's reaction and response, I think I've made that clear, and I don't know the exact reasons behind his decision,

4572
04:08:20,600 --> 04:08:24,600
but he couldn't have maintained it in good faith with the then-present arrangements.

4573
04:08:24,600 --> 04:08:28,600
It was the best thing to do, not just for him, but for Trisha as well, and everyone around them,

4574
04:08:28,600 --> 04:08:31,600
and honestly could have helped preserve a good friendship.

4575
04:08:31,600 --> 04:08:34,600
To do so much in public, on one hand, can be raw and powerful.

4576
04:08:34,600 --> 04:08:39,600
On the other hand, it blurs the line between persona and person, and Trisha is so bad with that.

4577
04:08:39,600 --> 04:08:43,600
I know I've probably said that before, but it doesn't become any less true,

4578
04:08:43,600 --> 04:08:46,600
and as the personal relationships become more and more intertwined,

4579
04:08:46,600 --> 04:08:52,600
it was clear that these moments of conflict were only going to cause more harm to Trisha, Ethan, crew, friends, and family.

4580
04:08:52,600 --> 04:08:57,600
At the start, I noted that a podcast sometimes could only run as long as there is a motivation,

4581
04:08:57,600 --> 04:09:02,600
but in the case of Frenemies, the motivation to start the podcast was ultimately the motivation taken to end it,

4582
04:09:02,600 --> 04:09:08,600
because what initially benefited them became a detriment as they grew closer, that friendship.

4583
04:09:08,600 --> 04:09:11,600
Unfortunately, that friendship couldn't be saved because of what followed.

4584
04:09:11,600 --> 04:09:14,600
Trisha's phase distinguished between that public and private aspect of Frenemies,

4585
04:09:14,600 --> 04:09:17,600
and Ethan being pushed past breaking point when reflecting on it.

4586
04:09:17,600 --> 04:09:20,600
If you had a time machine, you could probably change a few things,

4587
04:09:20,600 --> 04:09:25,600
and maybe it would have kept the podcast alive a little longer, but maybe it would have imploded even sooner.

4588
04:09:25,600 --> 04:09:29,600
Who knows, I think the one element that may have been worth saving was the friendship itself,

4589
04:09:29,600 --> 04:09:33,600
removing that betrayal and reflecting on the intent of the parties on that podcast,

4590
04:09:33,600 --> 04:09:37,600
and with the family involved, maybe it would have been a more peaceful conclusion for all.

4591
04:09:37,600 --> 04:09:41,600
Instead we had one which dragged in other parties, over-invested fans to an extreme degree,

4592
04:09:41,600 --> 04:09:45,600
and always ended up exhausting everyone actually involved because they couldn't say anything final.

4593
04:09:45,600 --> 04:09:50,600
As much as it's entertaining for audience members and possibly cathartic for yourself to go mask off in a stream,

4594
04:09:50,600 --> 04:09:55,600
Stalemate is never satisfying, and when you pit yourself against each other in such a way that's all you're ever going to end up with.

4595
04:09:55,600 --> 04:09:58,600
As we've seen, if you wrong Ethan, he's often not afraid to hold back.

4596
04:09:58,600 --> 04:10:00,600
That's for better and for worse with him,

4597
04:10:00,600 --> 04:10:04,600
particularly when he wants to rip into someone the way he would occasionally advise against.

4598
04:10:04,600 --> 04:10:06,600
We're pretty PC in general, too.

4599
04:10:06,600 --> 04:10:14,600
Like it's a comedy podcast, but I feel like we're pretty respectful at the same time.

4600
04:10:14,600 --> 04:10:19,600
Um, so, I don't know. I think some of y'all are just too sensitive.

4601
04:10:19,600 --> 04:10:21,600
You're not a politician.

4602
04:10:21,600 --> 04:10:23,600
Yeah, exactly, and thank God for that.

4603
04:10:23,600 --> 04:10:25,600
Thank you, by the way, for defending me.

4604
04:10:27,600 --> 04:10:32,600
I feel like, you know, if you're watching this show and you're perpetually offended by things I'm saying,

4605
04:10:32,600 --> 04:10:35,600
you may want to just stop watching, like genuinely.

4606
04:10:35,600 --> 04:10:38,600
And I'm trying my best to learn when I can,

4607
04:10:38,600 --> 04:10:44,600
and I did take and learn what I could from Matt, and I listened respectfully.

4608
04:10:45,600 --> 04:10:51,600
But, um, to say it's gross and disappointing, which is a comment I'm reading specifically,

4609
04:10:51,600 --> 04:10:59,600
uh, is just, I think you're too sensitive for the show. I really do. I'm sorry.

4610
04:10:59,600 --> 04:11:03,600
Ethan is a regularly cynical guy who tries to be socially conscious, but often fails,

4611
04:11:03,600 --> 04:11:06,600
and will draw criticism for supposed pandering and double standards due to it.

4612
04:11:06,600 --> 04:11:11,600
Trisha and their loyal fans clearly possess this impression that Ethan still only cared about the podcast for its content,

4613
04:11:11,600 --> 04:11:15,600
and not for them, and maybe at the start when some people raised that concern it was a valid point,

4614
04:11:15,600 --> 04:11:20,600
but over time I do think Ethan's intentions evolved, which I think is what made him so bitter at the end.

4615
04:11:20,600 --> 04:11:23,600
I think he did care, and I think he was embarrassed at himself for caring.

4616
04:11:23,600 --> 04:11:27,600
You see me as a troll and a trickster and nothing's true.

4617
04:11:27,600 --> 04:11:30,600
You see me as that way because you see through your own lens.

4618
04:11:30,600 --> 04:11:35,600
You yourself are only seeing your own kind of shadow being cast on the world.

4619
04:11:35,600 --> 04:11:36,600
That's not true, I don't...

4620
04:11:36,600 --> 04:11:37,600
Trisha has a problem with the public sphere.

4621
04:11:37,600 --> 04:11:43,600
As acknowledged early on, there's evidently an issue with the fact that they don't value the consequences their words can hold,

4622
04:11:43,600 --> 04:11:46,600
and the implications they may have in a socially sensitive environment.

4623
04:11:46,600 --> 04:11:49,600
Even if the comments didn't directly affect the people that were being referred to,

4624
04:11:49,600 --> 04:11:54,600
there were others in those circles, and even on the podcast, that did feel that impact.

4625
04:11:54,600 --> 04:11:59,600
Whether Trisha cared too much about themselves or not enough about others is judgement I'll leave down to you,

4626
04:11:59,600 --> 04:12:04,600
but whatever the reason, it ultimately wasn't one made for a podcast, or the podcast.

4627
04:12:04,600 --> 04:12:09,600
I know some will probably be disappointed that I didn't comment on Trisha's personal life more,

4628
04:12:09,600 --> 04:12:13,600
particularly their contentious marriage to Moses, but simply put, I don't know enough about it.

4629
04:12:13,600 --> 04:12:18,600
All I'll say is that I think Trisha needs people around them who don't condone their behaviour just because it's Trisha.

4630
04:12:18,600 --> 04:12:24,600
Give Trisha a reason to be better. Trisha can get better, it's just a shame that that wasn't the result of the podcast.

4631
04:12:24,600 --> 04:12:30,600
It was a project that yielded so much for Ethan and Trisha, but also left the feeling that there could have been so much more,

4632
04:12:30,600 --> 04:12:36,600
and it had long overreaching personal implications, leaving some questioning whether it was ever worth it.

4633
04:12:36,600 --> 04:12:42,600
For what it is worth though, one thing I've learned from reading too many comments was that even if it wasn't quite what it appeared to be,

4634
04:12:42,600 --> 04:12:45,600
Frenemies was still a moment of divine escapism for many.

4635
04:12:45,600 --> 04:12:50,600
Those who came home on a Monday night, tired and daunted by the week ahead, had something to look forward to.

4636
04:12:50,600 --> 04:12:58,600
Two of YouTube's most recognisable and polarising figures providing their informed and occasionally uninformed takes on YouTube drama.

4637
04:12:59,600 --> 04:13:07,600
Frenemies was chaotic, problematic, and deeply flawed, but it was also a compelling story that many followed closely and wanted that fairytale ending from.

4638
04:13:07,600 --> 04:13:12,600
Sometimes fiction is more fanciful than reality, and this was one of those times.

4639
04:13:12,600 --> 04:13:19,600
Yet, even if its legacy has been tainted, in many people's hearts, Trisha and Ethan will always be Frenemies.
