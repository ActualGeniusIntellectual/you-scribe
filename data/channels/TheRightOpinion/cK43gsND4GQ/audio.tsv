0	10680	Have you guys ever browsed Instagram and wondered why everyone looks so beautiful?
10680	12880	Why does everyone have such a perfect life?
12880	14540	I'll tell you why!
14540	16040	Because they're faking it!
16040	17040	No!
17040	18040	No!
18040	21360	That cannot be the same person!
21360	24440	Dude Coachella versus open casket funeral.
24440	27320	You said I look like a corpse in like an open casket funeral.
27320	28320	Yeah, you did!
28320	30560	Well, my friends, here we are.
30560	37480	They said it would never happen, me and Trisha making a podcast and frankly, I thought they
37480	38480	were right.
38480	44000	But let me explain, first of all, how what brings us to here, which is a pairing of very
44000	45000	bizarre.
45000	49200	I've been wanting to make a podcast with like another comedian for a while and I don't mean
49200	51520	that to compliment you.
51520	55520	I think I mean like two big personalities and in my mind, when I kept trying to think
55520	59300	of people to do it with, I always thought, you know, me and Trisha have a really funny
59300	63560	chemistry and I thought, well, you know, fuck it, let's just do it like that.
63560	64560	Let's do a live.
64560	65560	Fuck it!
65560	66560	All right, we're done.
66560	72760	Thank you guys.
72760	74640	We shouldn't have got pizza.
74640	80780	Hello, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the right opinion, the home of a twat with
80780	85660	too much free time and podcasts, something that I have a bit of a patchy record on.
85660	89320	In principle, there's always something enjoyable about being able to present a more raw version
89320	93460	of yourself, being able to speak casually without having to filter your mind so rigorously.
93460	97360	It's also a less demanding job in many regards, and although the result is never identical,
97360	100860	you can go into recording with a clear idea of who you're presenting to the audience.
100860	104820	For me, I guess I'll always be someone who requires the rehearsed nature of scripts to
104820	106220	maximize my full potential.
106220	110480	And although I'm not adverse to making appearances on podcasts here and there, I think I need
110480	114440	to focus my efforts on my content first and foremost, given how I have regularly failed
114440	115680	to do that of recent.
115680	119160	However, it is a thought that has taken up residence in my psyche.
119160	122640	What if I was to drop everything I was doing now, set up a new channel with the resources
122640	126740	I currently possess, and do something that doesn't require me tearing my hair out?
126740	130920	In a way, it's a decision that Ethan and Eda Klein, also known as H3H3 Productions,
130920	134980	made a few years ago when they decided to launch the H3 podcast, but let's rewind for
134980	139740	just a moment in case anyone here is not fully equated with the YouTuber Viathan that is
139740	140740	H3H3 Productions.
140740	145100	Game assassins out there, you think I was born looking this cool?
145100	149380	No, I used to look like you, losing to noobs every day.
149380	154540	That is until I discovered gamer gear that got my fashion on point, and I never lose
154540	156100	to noobs anymore.
156100	160500	Gamer gear glasses, help you see the game and look cooler than ever.
160500	163220	And our trademark item, gamer water.
163220	164900	Dude, fuck yeah, man.
164900	169180	H3H3 Productions is the YouTube channel run by the aforementioned Klein couple.
169180	173020	They established a presence on YouTube for content that often parodied their subjects,
173020	177180	usually utilising Ethan's offbeat sense of humour, alongside editing that put a somewhat
177180	180020	amusingly absurdist twist on the content they were lampooning.
180020	183780	Nonetheless, many of these videos also had an underlying moral message that resonated
183780	187660	with many viewers, often calling out many of the creators of their time for their often
187660	189780	shallow exploitation of YouTube culture.
189780	193780	They're funny, they're well made, and many of them are still relevant to this day.
193780	197540	They're videos I grew up with and will always find a place in my heart for, however a few
197540	200900	years ago, as many of you probably know, they themselves became the centre of attention
200900	204300	after one of the subjects of their videos, a gentleman by the name of Matt Hoss, decided
204300	205820	to sue them for copyright infringement.
205820	210140	It had been regularly debated on how much commentary constituted fair use, and with
210140	214380	H3's videos there was an uneasy trepidation that maybe, if the ruling went in favour of
214380	219340	the plaintiff, that a new gauntlet would be set down for further lawsuits in this domain.
219340	222780	Fortunately the case was won by our protagonists here, and they triumphantly returned to the
222780	226980	platform, cheered on by the platform itself and many creators whose livelihoods seemed
226980	230820	to depend on the verdict, however you can't really undo the stress that such a case would
230820	234380	cause you, and in the aftermath it seemed difficult to return to that content with the
234380	237820	same sort of gusto that they'd previously bought, and it's hard to blame them.
237820	241260	If anything, a lawsuit which required such an investment would inevitably sap the fun
241260	245220	out of the content that in many ways served as an escape at one point, so over time they
245220	248940	seemed to distance themselves further from the formula they had once been inseparable
248940	252560	from, venturing into new pastures, including the one we mentioned earlier.
252560	253560	The Podcast
253560	276840	The H3 Podcast was founded on the 8th of April 2017, with the first episode being broadcast
276840	280240	on the same day, a few months before the lawsuit was settled.
280240	283680	This format seemed rather unexceptional on the surface, Ethan would bring on a guest,
283680	288060	often someone with a pretty well established media presence, sometimes a real A-list celebrity,
288060	289060	and they would shoot the shit.
289060	292440	It's a concept that's been tried and tested over and over again, and although not always
292440	297400	yielding groundbreaking results, you'd typically expect it to be a mostly uncontroversial formula,
297400	300560	and at the start it certainly was, but then something began to happen.
300560	327160	I think in a way it's a peril with any commentator that has a tendency to say what's on their
327160	331940	mind at a specific moment, but something about H3 in the podcast environment didn't
331940	335240	always hit the best notes for certain viewers, and fellow creators.
335240	338100	There were moments that just seemed a bit out of step for his image, and eventually
338100	341960	people began to express their frustration which generated controversy in itself.
341960	369880	Now, H3 often did take time to address specific dramas, even occasionally admitting their
369880	373520	flaws and shortcomings, and pledging to do better, however they seemed to also have
373520	377940	an inexorable nature to be drawn towards the flame of conflict, and this is where we introduce
377940	380560	the second character in this convoluted story.
380560	384840	I feel like such a DIY right now.
384840	389000	If we can make this fattuccini pink I will be so happy.
389000	394120	So I'm just gonna go ahead and, hopefully don't get this all over me.
394120	395840	I don't know what food coloring really tastes like.
395840	399060	I don't think it's supposed to have a taste?
399060	402080	Whoa, first of all, it's sporting literally everywhere.
402080	403320	Can't relate.
403320	408600	This looks more red, but the cap is pink.
408600	414860	Okay, we're gonna try and not... This looks like... not appetizing.
414860	418740	This is Trisha Paytas, they are a veteran creator and no stranger to this channel.
418740	423860	It's difficult to talk about what they do at length, because they tend to be more of a YouTube socialite at this point,
423860	429260	renowned for their own involvement with the platformer elites and dramas that these dynamics occasionally precipitate.
429260	432860	They're outspoken, often unapologetic, and quite unpredictable.
432860	438220	In many ways, they're not the prime candidate for the co-host of a podcast that seems to be trying to clean up its act.
438220	444560	In many ways, they were the polar opposite of someone like Ethan who seemed to care deeply about his public image, and yet...
444560	448900	Ethan- Well, my friends, here we are. They said it would never happen.
448900	455460	It happened. In fact, its life cycle was longer than many probably predicted, with a total episode count just shy of 40.
455460	460740	However, to nobody's surprise, there was still no lack of fireworks, and even when the podcast soared to its highest peaks,
460740	464720	it could only have forebode its inevitable demise, and yet it didn't even end there.
464720	467300	In fact, it seems to have only escalated.
467300	493420	There's a lot more to the story of H3 and Trish's relationship that underlines the characters of both parties involved,
493420	497180	a few that long existed and will long outlive many other dramas.
497180	502820	If you're interested in the story, then I suggest we follow it a little further, but to unravel the story in its entirety,
502820	510060	we need to first head back to 2019, where these two strangers first became acquainted, and sowed the seeds for their ill-fated podcasts.
510060	514060	Let's see how these frenemies became, well, friends and enemies.
514060	521940	But first, ad time. The following ad is region and age specific, so if you're under 21 or live outside the United States,
521940	527740	then this is unlikely to apply to you. The following ad also contains depictions of recreational drug use,
527740	533460	so if that's not your jam, you may want to skip to part two. For those who are still here, I hope you enjoy.
533460	554060	Okay, guys. I need a video done by tomorrow. Does anyone have an idea right now? Anyone?
554060	557100	Lenuski. I need an idea now, Lenuski.
557100	565060	All right, yeah, that's cool. I have like a few dozen of them. All right, so because kale is like a superfood and we want to like lean into that element,
565060	570820	since, you know, the product is kale, I feel like we could capitalize off of like the Marvel Cinematic Universe,
570820	577820	so like induce like a lot of the super based puns and whatnot. And then that way we can appeal to all the children and their dads who never grew up.
577820	584740	Do you seriously think we're going to do a video about kale?
584740	589540	Will you hit me again if I say yes? Shut the fuck up and get out.
589540	597540	What the fuck do you think you're doing? Get the fuck out, right? I need more ideas. Aubrey, give me an idea now.
597540	603460	An idea for the video. Aubrey, idea now. Video idea.
603460	609380	Okay, so hear me out. So the Minecraft dream, right? So he's green, like the product for the sponsor.
609380	615060	So they kind of tie in together. Dream, green, kind of rhyme. So we got the green, green fans and the dream fans.
615060	619980	You know, a lot of people like dream and the color green. So I think it ties in together nicely, wouldn't you say?
619980	627380	Yeah, yeah. Do you think that's a good idea? It's a shit idea, right?
627380	633900	Yeah. Do you want to say that idea again? I don't think I do.
633900	642780	Okay, so I was thinking we could make a video on experimental cloud rapper, Blady, because he smokes weed all the time.
642780	648500	I don't have a fucking clue what the fuck you're talking about. Does anyone know what he's talking about?
648500	655900	It's Blady. Blade. Blade. Blade. It's a strange game, guys.
655900	663380	Another idea, now. Alright, so we make a video on experimental cloud rapper Echo2K.
663380	670860	Who the fuck is 2K Mecco? I don't want any more SoundCloud rappers from your mouth.
670860	685380	We make a video on experimental hip hop.
685380	691580	Coach, you better fucking have an idea. It's now you.
691580	697380	Oh, make it good. Please make it good. A lot of the stuff we get is like shit that happens on Twitter.
697380	701060	Like if someone getting canceled, maybe you could go with that. You know, people need that.
701060	710100	And who should we cancel? Alright, hear me out. Maybe, maybe, maybe Tro gets into some shit and like,
710100	719100	what's the contents around that? I feel like this is out of my, like, I might kill someone right now.
719100	725100	I don't think you should go that far. We kind of need him. It's Tro. Okay.
725100	738100	Hello? Yeah. Yeah, okay. Cold. Yeah. Basement.
738100	747100	Okay. Kind of you. Thank you. You're off in there!
747100	755100	Five minutes. Five minutes.
768100	797100	You know what? I think I got it.
798100	808100	Oh yeah? What about a four hour video on Frenemies?

850100	859100	Aubrey, I'm sorry man. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. I love you.
859100	864100	I love you too, Deckard. I'm sorry.
864100	871100	2019 was a curious year for H3. Emerging from the drama of the previous 12 months, they had maintained a pretty strong
871100	876100	upload schedule on both their podcast and their main channel. These videos certainly didn't evoke the energy of the
876100	881100	main channel's supposed heyday, but the truth is that times have changed, and so have they. However, one video
881100	886100	seemed to be a departure from not only their previous content, but in my opinion, their channel as a whole.
886100	891100	Comedy has certainly evolved on YouTube, particularly in the last few years. There's a lot of talk about what jokes one
891100	895100	can and can't make these days, and although there's definitely been a clamp down on certain creators in the
895100	901100	commentary genre, there are still liberties you can take, and on the 8th of May 2019, I'd say H3H3 Productions
901100	905100	exercised those with a video named Instagram vs Reality.
905100	911100	Have you ever browsed Instagram and wondered why everyone looks so beautiful? Why does everyone have such a perfect life?
911100	916100	Why is everyone having so much fun, has perfect skin, is always laughing and smiling?
916100	923100	Why is my life so boring as I sit here in my underwear covered in breadcrumbs, sad and alone?
923100	928100	Why? I'll tell you why. Because they're faking it. That is not you.
928100	932100	The one on the left is on the beach, the one on the right just washed up on the beach.
932100	934100	Oh damn, Tana's looking pretty good these days.
934100	935100	Oh.
938100	942100	I can't believe it's the same day. She looks like a Twinkie.
942100	947100	Now as the title implies, it's about how many individuals tend to airbrush and edit their content to make it conform
947100	952100	more with society's superficial standards surrounding beauty. On the surface, this is quite a progressive message,
952100	957100	and there's nothing overtly wrong with calling that out. The video itself doesn't pull any punches when addressing
957100	963100	these individuals who are thought to be participating in these shenanigans, one of those in particular being Trisha Paytas.
963100	969100	This girl tried to use a face filter on Instagram and her phone blew up. There's another one of her.
969100	975100	Ah, she is the best. Isn't she not the best? Would people even recognize her if they saw her on the street?
975100	981100	I mean, she is unrecognizable. This is Coachella vs throwing down in the McDonald's parking lot at 3am.
981100	989100	This is Coachella vs World Star Hip Hop. No, that cannot be the same person.
989100	993100	Dude, Coachella vs open casket funeral.
993100	998100	I have a lot of thoughts on this video as a whole, but I don't think it's necessary to the story we're constructing.
998100	1003100	All I will say is that at the time, regardless of Trisha's own reputation, this video did draw a bit of backlash.
1003100	1008100	I think the main reason is because although it is completely fair to attack society's beauty standards and those who prop it up,
1008100	1012100	attacking that person's appearance somewhat undermines the message in people's eyes,
1012100	1016100	because then you yourself are using those standards as a stepping stone for your own point against it,
1016100	1018100	which seems somewhat contradictory.
1018100	1022100	How you interrupt the video ultimately comes down to what you think of these people's intent,
1022100	1027100	whether they are just another victim of unattainable beauty standards or they're knowingly contributing to that toxicity.
1027100	1034100	If we want commentary on Trisha's own intent, however, we are guaranteed to at least receive it from one source, Trisha themselves.
1034100	1041100	Don't understand that there's so many more things that go into it than just stop eating, start exercising, stop being lazy.
1041100	1043100	That is so much more to it.
1043100	1050100	Oh my God, if people could even understand 10% of the mental struggles that a lot of overweight people go through.
1050100	1055100	And I'm going to speak on myself, like, if you could even be inside this head for like a minute, a minute,
1055100	1061100	and to see why I use food as like a coping mechanism, like, and it sucks.
1061100	1066100	Now, Trisha had already responded once to Ethan's comments the previous year relating to society's beauty standards
1066100	1069100	when H3 had made comments surrounding the model test holiday.
1069100	1075100	It was clear that there was some disparity between the opinions each held about how they think the matter should be approached,
1075100	1079100	but with the crosshairs shifted towards Trisha, the spotlight was firmly on them to respond.
1079100	1084100	Trisha first put out a series of tweets that attacked H3H3 for their video, calling it predatory and harmful,
1084100	1087100	and labelling Klein a disgusting piece of shysa.
1087100	1092100	Nevertheless, of the belief that such tweets were not sufficient retribution for the Klein's misdemeanors,
1092100	1099100	Trisha uploaded a video, further chastising H3H3 for their comments and depiction of sensitive issues that could impact many young girls growing up.
1112100	1116100	In very typical Trisha fashion, it takes whatever valid criticism or responses could be made
1116100	1120100	and blows them wildly out of proportion. Additionally, it meshes a variety of points together,
1120100	1124100	including technical points about whether the photos Ethan compared were taken on the same day,
1124100	1128100	or more emotional points about how this has affected them and other vulnerable individuals.
1128100	1135100	You're not taking something from that day and showing it from a video clip in the same hair and makeup,
1135100	1142100	you're taking all my photos he showed. One he showed a side by side was one I posted myself to show how different
1142100	1149100	My whole point of that post was to be like, yes, I can be glam and I feel good about myself and also I can be like how I was looking and just like selfie down,
1149100	1156100	like not the most attractive and I was doing that to show like, yes, to show what I guess he was trying to prove,
1156100	1162100	but he did that in such a way of like, it was bullying. It really, really upset me. It really upset me.
1162100	1168100	It's not that I don't understand how such comments could upset someone like Trisha if they feel as vulnerable about their appearance as they present.
1168100	1173100	However, as a public figure, you're going to be the butt of these jokes, and Ethan's point, whether you agree with it or not,
1173100	1177100	is that all of our appearances are flawed, and that trying to cover it up is only going to do more harm.
1177100	1181100	This was a difference in perspective that neither side was going to compromise on,
1181100	1184100	because they both seemed to believe that they were starting from the righteous premise.
1184100	1189100	Trisha in empowering girls to post pictures of themselves online free from stigma from judgemental parties,
1189100	1194100	and Ethan in tearing down the unrealistic thresholds of natural beauty pushed by many of these people.
1194100	1199100	There was never going to be a compromise, yet it could have just ended here.
1199100	1203100	Instead though, not happy with the response their video was receiving, Trisha pursued the feud online,
1203100	1207100	once again escalating the comments, now directing them at Ethan's wife and child,
1207100	1210100	providing some invaluable couples counselling on their marriage as well.
1210100	1215100	Ethan, unfazed by these comments, continued to dunk on Trisha and the photoshop employing their content.
1215100	1220100	At this point, Ethan took the W, because he avoided taking the comments to the personal level that Trisha did,
1220100	1225100	and maintained his stance pretty staunchly. This is where the direct interaction appeared to end though,
1225100	1229100	with Ethan delivering a final address to it on his podcast a few days later.
1251100	1256100	First is, why are you on your kitchen floor? There's gotta be a better setting for this.
1256100	1260100	Although brief, this exchange highlighted the contrasting dynamic shared between the two.
1260100	1265100	Trisha, a person who really behaves on that emotional whim, the person who will readily bear their teeth at those
1265100	1268100	that they wish to, and take their comments to places that many would consider beneath them.
1268100	1273100	Ethan, on the other hand, may make provocative content from time to time, but also has a grasp on his own opinions,
1273100	1278100	and in this case, maintain control of the conversation, not falling for the outrage base set by Trisha.
1278100	1283100	Trisha pages said before that they will often chase the behaviour that guards them the most attention,
1283100	1288100	but in this instance, they kinda hit that brick wall, where they didn't manage to elicit a rise out of their opponent.
1288100	1293100	With this in mind, barely a couple days after their explosive rage, their tune changed, and they began posting somewhat
1293100	1297100	strangely worded praise for Ethan, even asking if they could make an appearance on their podcast.
1297100	1302100	As far as I'm aware, at this point they had not collaborated, so this tweet may have been a bit tongue in cheek,
1302100	1306100	though I have to say I'm not sure where the tongue or the cheek are, but I digress.
1306100	1311100	This was the first time that Trisha had signaled interest in collaborating on the podcast with H3H3,
1311100	1315100	however this interest wasn't initially reciprocated by the clients who didn't respond to these tweets,
1315100	1320100	and continued with their routine podcast schedule, seemingly paying no mind to Trisha and their antics.
1320100	1324100	However, if anyone thought this quarrel in question was quite quelled, well, they were in for a little shock.
1324100	1330100	That was an epic collab, I totally didn't anticipate it, like this came so out of left field,
1330100	1335100	but I think I enjoyed it, I think deep down she enjoyed it as well.
1335100	1340100	Something about Ethan's comedy and Trisha's desire for attention seemed to bring them together,
1340100	1345100	and as the capers continued to increment, these characters were set on a collision course that could not be averted.
1356100	1361100	Over the next few months, not too much of note happened, there was the occasional acknowledgement or mention of either party,
1361100	1367100	but otherwise it seemed that this had mostly cooled, however all this changed when Trish decided to post a video coming out as transgender.
1367100	1374100	So, in my head I feel like I'm a transgender female to male, but also like a drag queen.
1374100	1382100	That's kind of how I've like rationalised it in my head, because like, okay, let me just tell you why I identify as a boy more so,
1382100	1390100	and from an early age. I don't like to be centre of attention, except when I want to be centre of attention.
1390100	1396100	Once again, I think we can keep this relatively brief, but this video was met with a lot of controversy for how it handled the subject matter
1396100	1400100	and the communities that it references, regardless of whether Trisha truly was transgender.
1400100	1405100	The day after, in light of the less than supportive response, Trisha posted an apology video,
1405100	1407100	which unfortunately seems to have been lost to the sands of time.
1407100	1412100	This was once again received fairly poorly, and provoked another response on the 8th Street Podcast.
1412100	1420100	She just kind of describes like a lot of people, she says, I don't know, some days I don't wear makeup and I just wear comfy clothes.
1420100	1422100	Trans, that means she's trans.
1422100	1429100	I really relate to men, and I like to hang out with men more than women, and so therefore she thinks she's a guy.
1429100	1433100	So take a guess what happens next, I'm telling you, it will shock you.
1433100	1441100	Trisha took to Twitter to insult Ethan, however in a twist, this time posting some rather sensitive images that we shan't go into detail about.
1441100	1445100	Ethan responds fairly unamused, and then Trisha brings up Ela like clockwork.
1445100	1448100	Oh, and what would a situation be without a Trisha video?
1448100	1456100	Apparently she came out recently as a trans male, so I guess she would know something about s**t.
1456100	1459100	Although I bet you Trisha's got a large s**t that's bigger than my s**t.
1459100	1460100	Hell yeah I do.
1460100	1464100	She's got one of those weird girls, she's got like an engorged s**t.
1465100	1468100	It is a meaty, I have a meaty ass s**t.
1468100	1475100	It is so meaty and tight, it's like biting into an Arby's roast beef sandwich without the beef curtains.
1475100	1479100	However this time, instead of the dispute dying a death like the previous altercation,
1479100	1485100	Ethan responded to the Twitter publication of the video by inviting them on the podcast, if they were man enough.
1485100	1490100	At first Trisha, seeming hesitant to commit, requests an advance payment of $18 million,
1490100	1493100	a fairly regular sum for most H3 guests, I'm sure.
1493100	1496100	However, Ethan calls Trisha on their bluff, stating that they'll do it for free.
1496100	1503100	Chief negotiator Trisha then makes a minor amendment to the condition, stating that they may appear if Ethan apologizes for all his dumbass trolling,
1503100	1506100	something which Trisha is obviously a stranger to.
1506100	1511100	A few days later, on the 16th of October, Ethan uploads another video which includes a parody apology to Trisha,
1511100	1516100	mocking their often melodramatic setup, providing the implication that negotiations had perhaps broken down.
1517100	1525100	I wanted to basically apologize to Trisha Paytas, who is such a sweet, genuine person,
1525100	1533100	and I just really, like, I wanted to first of all apologize for saying that she looked like she was at an open casket funeral,
1533100	1536100	like she was the corpse inside of a casket.
1536100	1541100	That's not true, that's just not what I meant at all, you're so beautiful, you're such a queen.
1541100	1549100	And I also wanted to apologize for saying that you have, like, a 5 to 10 inch engorged clit that's bigger than my dick.
1549100	1555100	I mean, that would basically make you a guy, that would basically mean you had a penis,
1555100	1562100	and, well, I guess I'm kind of confused because you said you're trans, I don't know, I just am sorry, I don't want to offend you.
1563100	1573100	I'm sorry for saying that you're not trans, man, even though you have, like, cup f jugs that are always on display.
1573100	1579100	With the unpredictability of Trisha, it would be normal to assume that this interaction would fizzle out like many others had.
1579100	1584100	However, in a surprise turn of events, approximately a fortnight later, a photo was posted on Twitter
1584100	1589100	that showed the two parties together alongside a link to Trisha's debut on the H3 podcast.
1589100	1594100	Well, first of all, Trisha Paytas is here, are we here to squash the beef or roast the beef?
1594100	1602100	Ooh, I would love to squash it, but I like you guys talking about me, so maybe we'll roast more.
1602100	1604100	That's what I figured, thank you for saying that.
1604100	1608100	It's now a half of the two parties addressing and appearing to mostly settle their differences.
1608100	1614100	On the one hand, Trisha handles themselves pretty well, in fact responding to certain questions with a degree of eloquence not typically associated with them,
1614100	1620100	such as certain gender-related queries, where their responses actually add a lot of nuance to their prior content on the matter.
1620100	1626100	A lot of people are transphobic, me coming out transgender is not gonna help my dating life, it's not gonna, why would I put that on myself?
1626100	1632100	I'm trying to date, I'm trying to get married, why would I put that out there just so people can look up that I'm a transgender if I truly don't believe that?
1632100	1637100	It always fascinates me how the internet can be surprisingly hostile to those who may just be expressing confusion,
1637100	1642100	and although Trisha did make some insensitive comments, their confusion was nothing to write off on their own basis.
1642100	1645100	In fact, I think many only responded the way they did because it's Trisha.
1645100	1649100	The podcast allowed them to make their own defence, and I think that was a positive thing.
1649100	1653100	On the other hand though, it kinda reminds me of James Merritt's interview with Nikocado Avocado.
1653100	1659100	You appear to have two parties engaging in casual conversation, however when you know both parties relatively well,
1659100	1663100	particularly Trisha, you begin to pick up on certain details that others may overlook.
1663100	1681100	In this part Trisha says they go to Israel all the time, which just isn't true.
1681100	1687100	It's such a trivial detail to lie about, so trivial that you don't feel like it's worth even pulling them up on it.
1687100	1691100	When it comes to other points though, Trisha was caught with their trousers down.
1692100	1695100	I'm not trying to expose anything that's private, but...
1695100	1697100	It's all demonetised.
1697100	1704100	Hold on, hold on, hold on. Where is it? Apology, and then it's coming up regarding my...
1704100	1711100	I am transgender, 3 million views, green icon, monetised, and I'm gonna tell you exactly how much money she made.
1711100	1714100	She made $8,000 for that video!
1714100	1719100	It's a fascinating watch in many ways because it outlined that character that Trisha Paytas has cultivated,
1719100	1722100	and places it in an environment where it can receive direct scrutiny.
1722100	1728100	I do want to save some analysis for the end of the video, but it certainly illuminates how differently Trisha views the consequence
1728100	1731100	of their own language and behaviour in comparison to a lot of other creators.
1731100	1736100	However, this podcast appearance wouldn't be possible without two people, namely Ethan and Hila.
1737100	1741100	I mean, clearly not all men are violent, I mean, like that.
1741100	1742100	But some are.
1742100	1748100	And a lot are cheaters, a lot are perverts, a lot of underage girls, like, yeah.
1748100	1756100	So do you, are you ever afraid that it might be that your choices drive these bad characters into your life?
1756100	1758100	My choices is how?
1758100	1760100	And men. The men you're attracted to.
1760100	1763100	I feel like I date everybody, like anybody who wants to date me, I'll date them.
1763100	1767100	So I feel like I don't, I'm not picky, I just date whoever wants to date me.
1767100	1773100	So maybe the image you put out to the world attracts the wrong kind of guy.
1773100	1776100	I've heard that. Oh my god, this is like therapy now.
1776100	1777100	Oh my god, it's so deep.
1777100	1780100	You are like a dad, even though you're only 34, you're like a 45 year old dad.
1780100	1781100	I am a dad.
1781100	1786100	Ethan has the energy of an accommodating yet critical host, and although patronising and slightly presumptive at points,
1786100	1789100	he doesn't just endlessly grill Trisha like some probably would.
1789100	1793100	He lets them say their peace and challenges when he feels necessary, catching them out a few times.
1793100	1797100	At the same time, there's this still somewhat standoffish nature between the two parties,
1797100	1801100	particularly with Ela's presence, who still seems somewhat sceptical towards Trisha,
1801100	1804100	and their nature to fluctuate between flirtatious and insulting towards Ethan.
1804100	1807100	I love that we're on a three-way date right now, we're like eating and talking.
1807100	1811100	We're like coffee. Ethan is the worst, I have to say that.
1811100	1813100	You're kind of just the worst. I think Ela...
1813100	1818100	Wait, hold on, so you hated me, you came in liking me more, but now you hate me again.
1818100	1822100	It's a mesmerising experience, these two internet veterans dissecting an individual
1822100	1827100	who has in many ways occupied the spotlight for so long, yet seldom been understood by those attacking them.
1827100	1831100	By the end of the podcast, although it felt like any dispute had been placated,
1831100	1834100	you weren't really sure if there were seeds for a future relationship.
1834100	1839100	Some tension in the air still lingered, and with everything in mind, that was to be expected.
1839100	1845100	But somewhere deep down, there was the potential for something truly great, and I think people knew that.
1848100	1853100	As I mentioned at the start, Klein had been involved in a fair bit of drama relating to how he handled himself on the podcast,
1853100	1855100	but also how he interacted with guests.
1855100	1858100	And he also had a zillion kids, so I mean, yeah.
1858100	1859100	Really? How many siblings do you have?
1859100	1862100	I don't know, dude. The internet's too fucking weird to give out all that information.
1862100	1866100	Oh, you don't even want to say how many, because you're afraid that it will not compromise your privacy.
1866100	1869100	Yeah, by all means, keep talking about it. Is there anybody who can cut this out?
1869100	1870100	I'm honest, dude.
1870100	1871100	Seriously?
1871100	1873100	Yeah, no, dude. Yeah, there's fucking lunatics out there.
1873100	1874100	Okay.
1874100	1875100	Well...
1875100	1876100	Off the air, off the air, I'll tell you.
1876100	1877100	Alright.
1878100	1879100	Jeez.
1879100	1885100	There were a lot of theories as to why this was, but many at the time were under the impression that he was not a naturally talented podcast host,
1885100	1888100	particularly when he appeared with certain people, and that's completely fine.
1888100	1895100	The transfer from video content that can be scripted and edited to a podcast where you really have to devote your full attention towards each and every moment
1895100	1897100	can be an exceptionally difficult one.
1897100	1904100	However, sometimes it's about who you're doing the podcast with, and Trisha Paytas was someone that you never ran out of questions for,
1904100	1909100	and if you're an inquisitive person like Klein is in a way, then it was quite easy to maintain and engage in conversation,
1909100	1912100	even if it does seem more like a case study at points.
1912100	1916100	It doesn't taste like anything to me. The squid I got is like a transparent squid, so it just doesn't taste like anything.
1916100	1921100	It was a wild goal. I mean, I used to eat like goldfish as a kid, I used to like swallow goldfish, so I don't think you're supposed to do that either.
1921100	1923100	But I would just eat the fish out of the bowl.
1923100	1924100	Why would you do that?
1924100	1927100	I don't know, I thought it was honestly food. I was young, I was like five.
1927100	1933100	For a while it seemed like this was the most confab we were going to see, as the two turned back towards their own ventures over the following months,
1933100	1938100	until the start of 2020 that is, when they returned to the podcast for another session of antics.
1938100	1939100	I love this.
1939100	1941100	So it is like a throuple.
1941100	1944100	It's not a throuple. It's definitely not a throuple.
1944100	1946100	I think of it like parents, but now I think of it like a throuple.
1946100	1948100	I feel like this because me and Hila are getting along good.
1948100	1950100	Please don't think of it as a throuple.
1950100	1952100	It's like a little date right now.
1952100	1954100	Definitely not a date.
1954100	1960100	One of the constant struggles that Trisha has been quite open about on her channel is their often fruitless endeavour to find a relationship,
1960100	1968100	and during their appearances on the two episodes of the podcast, Trisha had a nature to make certain comments that seemed to seek validation for intimacy with those they were around.
1968100	1975100	These include the numerous rather pointed flirtatious remarks towards Ethan, and referring to the podcast's collective presence as a throuple.
1975100	1980100	Ethan and Hila weren't completely sold in this dynamic though, and had their own plans for Trisha going forward.
1980100	1985100	The year prior, the clients had conducted a dating game of sorts with an individual known as Ian the Intern,
1985100	1989100	where they would peruse dating profiles and attempt to set him up with some lovely ladies.
1989100	1996100	They compared this setup to the show The Bachelor, a show that I am unfortunately completely oblivious to, and have very little interest in learning about.
1996100	2002100	Unfortunately, Ian seemed to undermine the show when he messaged one of the participants, and then decided that he didn't want her to come on the show.
2002100	2007100	Nonetheless, the concept was a hit with the audience, so clearly the clients thought they would bring it back for season two,
2007100	2011100	this time branding it as The Bachelorette with You Know Who in the starring role.
2011100	2022100	I brought Trisha back here, and the reason that Trisha's joining us today is, as you all know, Ian's had a season of The Bachelor, with an H3 instead of a...
2022100	2025100	It's a capital H in a three, Bachelor.
2025100	2029100	And so Ian actually found true love on his season.
2029100	2036100	We had some ups and downs, we had some controversies, but in the end, Ian has been dating a girl for how long, Ian?
2037100	2040100	For about, since last September around there, October.
2040100	2042100	Since last September, Hila came through.
2042100	2043100	Wow.
2043100	2045100	So he's in love.
2045100	2046100	And he met up on the show?
2046100	2048100	Yes. So the show worked.
2048100	2050100	Wow, I didn't know this.
2050100	2051100	The show worked.
2051100	2052100	Oh, I had no idea this was a thing.
2052100	2064100	And so we take this very seriously, love is very important to me and Hila, and our community, and we thought, Trisha Paytas, now that's the next season of The Bachelorette.
2064100	2069100	With so many eligible young gentlemen falling at their feet, it was clear that Trisha was spoiled for choice.
2069100	2072100	However, Trisha seemed to have eyes for one person in particular.
2072100	2079100	I thought, I don't know if I can say this, and you can cut it if I'm not supposed to say this, but I was low-key hoping,
2079100	2084100	because originally I was expecting the idea to come on as a contestant, and Hila's brother is going to be The Bachelor,
2084100	2086100	and then I thought maybe he would apply to be on My Bachelorette.
2086100	2088100	He was supposed to, I don't know what happened.
2088100	2090100	He said that he wanted to apply.
2090100	2091100	I found it on Instagram, it's fine.
2091100	2093100	We could take a last minute submission.
2093100	2096100	He said he wanted to, I think he's honestly super busy.
2096100	2102100	He's like a fucking mega, hard, he's like a, he should make time though, right?
2102100	2103100	He should make time.
2103100	2104100	He should make time.
2104100	2106100	He looks so hot, I was like low-key impressed.
2106100	2107100	I was like, holy shit.
2107100	2109100	Like he's strikingly hot.
2109100	2110100	Okay, we'll make sure.
2110100	2111100	This is Moses Ackman.
2111100	2117100	He's an Israeli-born artist and architect who is relevant enough to have his own Wikipedia page, so that must mean something.
2117100	2122100	He is best known for his work Faces of Water which uses an artistic technique involving liquid iron,
2122100	2128100	all in all he seems like a reasonably talented artist who possesses some prestige in his field of operation.
2128100	2134100	However, he is also the brother of Hila Klein, and a Bachelorette entrant that Trisha seemed quite drawn towards.
2134100	2139100	Trisha had been known to have a somewhat strange interest towards humans of Jewish background,
2139100	2144100	and therefore it was probably not particularly surprising given their reputation that they liked Moses.
2144100	2149100	However, it was still a strange dynamic, and one that Hila at least didn't seem too eager to foster.
2174100	2176100	We'll get- we'll get Moses in here too.
2176100	2176600	Now-
2176600	2177100	Moses!
2177100	2178100	That's his name, yeah.
2178100	2180100	Fuck that name, that's crazy.
2180100	2182100	You better fucking Moses, holy shit.
2182100	2183100	And he looks like Jesus.
2183100	2184100	The hell of a thing.
2184100	2186100	Like, write the three commandments on my pussy.
2187100	2188100	Sorry, what was that?
2188100	2189100	What did she say?
2189100	2190100	I don't know.
2191100	2192100	Like, nevermind.
2192100	2194100	Nevermind, it's fine.
2194100	2198100	His name is Moses, he might spread your red seed.
2198100	2199100	Ooh!
2199100	2200100	Is he into that?
2200100	2202100	Yeah, he'll eat you out when you're on your period.
2202100	2203100	He's into that.
2203100	2206100	I don't want to see him right now, I wouldn't want to deal with him today.
2206100	2212100	The rules of The Bachelorette were set so that Trisha was advised against contacting any of the participants privately,
2212100	2214100	particularly with the season one incident in mind.
2214100	2218100	However, if they were to do so, there would be full disclosure with Ethan and Hila.
2218100	2222100	It seemed there was some understanding between everyone that would help make the show a success.
2222100	2224100	But then it happened.
2224100	2225100	Yes, lockdown.
2225100	2227100	Caused by our good old pathogenic friend.
2228100	2233100	And the H3 podcast was put on hold while they worked out a new arrangement compatible with the then present restrictions.
2233100	2238100	However, even if the H3 podcast was on hold, there was no stopping the Trisha show,
2238100	2241100	who decided that they had to take matters into their own hands.
2241100	2246100	And just over a month after the launch of The Bachelorette season two, it came to an abrupt end.
2246100	2253100	On her Instagram stories, in bed with somebody, and we see a hand, and I'm like...
2254100	2257100	Again, cryptic. I think that's his, I think it's his arm.
2258100	2259100	It looks like it.
2259100	2260100	It could be.
2260100	2262100	It definitely is.
2262100	2266100	But the evidence piles on as we continue forth here.
2266100	2270100	She posts pictures of, she says, quarantine date night.
2272100	2273100	Okay, now.
2273100	2274100	Okay.
2274100	2275100	So let's just, so okay.
2275100	2280100	This is a separate day, so whoever this is, has come back to her house, a date night.
2280100	2283100	She calls it a date night, and whoever it is brought dinner.
2283100	2287100	Yes, on March the 23rd, Trisha posted pictures of them with Moses,
2287100	2291100	with the somewhat oxymoronic statement that they were social distancing together.
2291100	2295100	Ethan did not see the funny side of this, but Trisha continued to openly flaunt their rendezvous,
2295100	2298100	much to the dismay of Ackman's sister and her husband,
2298100	2301100	with them asserting that Trisha had ruined the show with their mischief.
2301100	2306100	I have to tell you that I don't know what he's up to.
2306100	2307100	Right.
2307100	2309100	This isn't some inside joke.
2309100	2312100	Look at the way he's looking at, so this is what Trisha posted.
2312100	2313100	Look at his face.
2313100	2314100	What is he doing?
2314100	2316100	It's like he's goofing on us.
2316100	2317100	Like, look.
2317100	2318100	Well, it's hard to tell.
2318100	2320100	Nice place, by the way, for Trisha.
2320100	2321100	Nice view.
2321100	2322100	You can't tell.
2322100	2323100	Hollywood Hills, by the way.
2323100	2325100	It could be just him smiling.
2328100	2329100	Bro, what are you doing?
2329100	2331100	What are you doing?
2331100	2333100	You know what's my biggest fear right now?
2333100	2335100	Is that this actually becomes serious.
2335100	2341100	So both of these people promise me to keep bit 100 billion with me.
2341100	2342100	Yes, they promise.
2342100	2344100	Like, I'm most disappointed in your brother.
2344100	2345100	Trisha, whatever.
2345100	2348100	You know, we serve at her pleasure.
2348100	2351100	I mean, you don't know which personality you're showing up from which day.
2351100	2353100	I'm just happy when she comes in.
2353100	2359100	I mean, I expected her to work within the guidelines, too.
2359100	2363100	Your brother, though, is on our side, and now I don't know whose side he's on.
2363100	2366100	Needless to say, I can understand why the two were frustrated.
2366100	2369100	Notably, given that this was the second time this had happened.
2369100	2372100	However, when you're dealing with love, you can't really put a contract on it.
2372100	2378100	And this was going to be inevitable with something as loosely structured as The Bachelorette, and with someone like Trisha.
2378100	2383100	This was just not a great idea from the start, and the circumstances only exacerbated that.
2383100	2388100	Although in many ways Trisha was the perfect podcast guest, their appeal was also your Achilles heel.
2388100	2391100	They were not a person who was going to play by your rules.
2391100	2396100	So when you impose these sorts of expectations on them, then you need to manage your own expectations as well.
2396100	2402100	That doesn't mean you can't find it frustrating, but it's somewhat inevitable when you deal with someone who you know is notoriously unpredictable.
2402100	2407100	H3 needed to think about this, but in the meantime, chaos reigned once more.
2422100	2428100	Although in a way it felt like Trisha was closer to the Klein's than they had ever been,
2428100	2434100	this only really intensified the tension between the creators, who openly criticised each other over the coming months.
2434100	2440100	In the meantime, to cement their commitment to the relationship, Trisha began learning Hebrew, and yes, uploading videos on the matter.
2440100	2446100	When the relationship was good, it was great, and the Klein's were trying to break an inseparable bond between soulmates,
2446100	2451100	and when the relationship wasn't working out, the Klein's were the cause of its demise. They really couldn't win.
2477100	2481100	Ethan and Hila seem to display some semblance of disapproval,
2481100	2487100	though I think there was a point where you have to begrudgingly accept that there is very little you can do to control a person like Trisha.
2487100	2493100	Trisha is someone who will put their own impulsive desires first, and will only play your game when they have a chance of winning,
2493100	2496100	and as Trisha said themselves, they won.
2496100	2502100	Of course so many people are like Trisha, you're not Jewish, and to that I say I was not born Jewish,
2502100	2507100	but I tend to gravitate towards Jewish people in my life, that have taught me a lot.
2507100	2512100	Once more, it went rather quiet for the next few months as the stalemates seemed to persist between the parties.
2512100	2515100	However, with everybody involved still one degree away from each other,
2515100	2519100	there was that sense that the dating show was far from the last we'd see of them together.
2519100	2524100	However, they'd really need a catalyst to bring them together. Who or what on earth could do that?
2524100	2529100	But the internet, there's nothing going on on the internet, so I decided to have you on anyways.
2529100	2531100	Sounds good to me.
2531100	2535100	Allow me to introduce two new guests to this very fun little house party.
2535100	2538100	Gabbie Hanna and our beloved Keemstar.
2538100	2543100	Gabbie Hanna is no stranger to controversy herself, and is a common talking boy for many commentators.
2543100	2548100	Her feud with Trisha Paytas is no less contentious, with Trisha accusing Gabbie of slander and harassment,
2548100	2554100	even threatening to take a restraining order out on her after she allegedly told Trisha's boyfriend Jason Nash that Trisha had herpes,
2554100	2559100	as explained in their now deleted video, Why I Don't Trust Gabbie Hanna.
2559100	2563100	When me and Jason started hooking up in 2017, I did a video called YouTubers I've Hooked Up With.
2563100	2567100	She, by the clues, guessed that I was hooking up with Jason. I was.
2567100	2572100	She texted Jason, and she told Jason, or I guess, I don't know if she texted him or told him in person,
2572100	2578100	but basically she told him, hey, be careful, Trisha has herpes and you're sleeping with her and blah blah blah.
2578100	2594100	Gabbie, have we slept together? Did I show you my STD results? Are you my doctor? Did you swab my vagina?
2594100	2598100	Gabbie did not debate that she had told Nash about the possibility of herpes,
2598100	2601100	and testified that she was merely warning a friend about certain health risks,
2601100	2606100	however she challenged the claims of harassment and stated Trisha was attempting to blackmail their mutual friends,
2606100	2609100	and since then any spirit of friendliness has been extinguished,
2609100	2612100	with Trisha making further videos asking Gabbie to leave them alone.
2612100	2617100	But it likely they're not chums, though some may be forgiven for thinking it's just another Pater's drama,
2617100	2619100	and there's nothing particularly exceptional about it.
2619100	2625100	Keemstar on the other hand, well honestly I would describe Ethan's attitude towards Keem quite exceptional,
2625100	2626100	at least for Ethan.
2627100	2632100	Keem, uh, clownstar, I know you're watching this because you're obsessed with me,
2632100	2638100	you're on every word and your blood is boiling, you're thinking to yourself, how am I going to destroy him?
2638100	2641100	How am I going to make a Twitter rant and then find some shit?
2641100	2644100	This guy literally got it, I don't need to keep going on about Keemstar,
2644100	2651100	it's not the first time he's just made actually slanderous lies about me, but that is that.
2651100	2657100	Ethan and Keem have a long history on YouTube, mostly hostile, with the occasional ceasefire when a greater cause united them.
2657100	2663100	But at the start of 2020, H3 released three videos that sought to malign Keemstar from the platform once and for all,
2663100	2666100	even criticizing those who willingly associated with him.
2666100	2670100	Keemstar's got a bottle of G-Fuel somewhere in his house that's actually a horcrux.
2670100	2672100	How is G-Fuel still sponsored by this guy by the way?
2672100	2677100	G-Fuel brought to you by false pedophilia accusations!
2677100	2678100	Check out G-Fuel!
2678100	2680100	Get it now at Gfuel.com
2680100	2686100	Keemstar responded to these videos with his own perspective, framing Ethan as a dishonest opportunist hack and all-round hypocrite
2686100	2689100	who didn't really care about the issues that he was speaking about.
2689100	2692100	There are a lot of valid opinions that one can have about this mess of a drama,
2692100	2696100	however one thing I would probably say is that if you were familiar with either of the creators,
2696100	2699100	it was unlikely to change your opinion on them.
2699100	2704100	At its core, the videos were a showcase of how much these guys truly detested each other,
2704100	2709100	and this continued over the next few months, with nobody really emerging as a clear victor.
2709100	2711100	So what is the relevance to these two people?
2711100	2715100	Well you see, in September, bored as hell at the fact that there was no news,
2715100	2720100	Keemstar decided to invite Gabbie Hanna onto Drama Alert to talk about writing a diss track on Trish,
2720100	2723100	which as you can assume went down like a lead balloon with our good friend,
2723100	2728100	who sent multiple tweets to Keemstar for platforming those who they had deemed pieces of f***,
2728100	2731100	even going as far to imply that their life could be on the line over this matter.
2731100	2736100	Hey Keemstar, from one fat f*** to another, get your f*** together.
2736100	2741100	Don't blame Gabbie Hanna for my death because she's mentally ill, you have no idea why I had to hire 24 hour security,
2741100	2747100	you sick f***, you think bringing up drama is all fun and games until you're egging on a mentally ill person,
2747100	2752100	saying I'm star d***, saying I'm insatiation, I'm f***ing scared for my life, you dumb son of a b****.
2752100	2757100	Now it's hard to really establish a motive for why exactly Keemstar decided to have Gabbie come on Drama Alert,
2757100	2763100	maybe he was genuinely bored, but Ethan appeared to back Trish's response, while continuing to speak ill of Keem.
2763100	2766100	Keemstar noticed these and subsequently went off on Twitter about it himself.
2766100	2772100	After this went nowhere, Keemstar reached out to Ethan offering a truce, framing it as the smartest thing to do.
2772100	2779100	In the coming months, more people were educated and they realised, oh wait, Keemstar's right, H3H3's a bad guy,
2779100	2787100	and now you're losing, and I'm winning, but the truth of the matter is that there's no winner, right?
2787100	2794100	We both lost, the lesser of the loser is not the winner. This is stupid.
2794100	2799100	And we're both going to continue to lose the more we fight.
2799100	2803100	And the smart thing to do is to make peace.
2803100	2810100	I'm inviting you, I'm Moms Basement, my podcast, to attempt to talk this out and to make peace,
2810100	2816100	if you don't want to come on my show, I'll go on your show, but we need to make peace.
2816100	2824100	This is affecting our companies, our careers, and not really my mental health,
2824100	2831100	but you said that it affected your mental health, so it's time to make peace.
2831100	2834100	Hypothetically, you can understand why Keemstar wanted to do this,
2834100	2838100	but logically it was something that H3 was very unlikely to agree to.
2838100	2841100	Maybe Keem knew that, and he wanted to appear to be the reasonable party,
2841100	2845100	but Ethan wasn't one to negotiate with someone he wanted to truly present as a terrible person,
2845100	2849100	given the lengths that he had gone to emphasise how bad a person Keemstar was,
2849100	2854100	and still was at that point, he had more to lose by patching up the drama with our bearded buddy.
2854100	2857100	However, what happened next seemed to cement his position.
2857100	2863100	Ethan- I've been wanting to make a podcast with another comedian for a while, and I don't mean that to compliment you.
2863100	2869100	I think I mean two big personalities, and in my mind when I kept trying to think of people to do it with,
2869100	2876100	I always thought, you know, me and Trisha have a really funny chemistry on all of your visits,
2876100	2883100	and I thought, well, you know, fuck it, let's just do it like that, let's do it live, fuck it!
2883100	2885100	Trisha- Oh, but this isn't live though.
2885100	2886100	Ethan- No, it's just still.
2886100	2892100	On September the 15th, Trisha made their return to the H3 podcast, however this wasn't just any old appearance,
2892100	2895100	and the way this was presented and discussed, this was the start of a new era,
2895100	2901100	a series featuring both Ethan and Trisha, where they discuss various dramatic and miscellaneous content,
2901100	2905100	whatever took their interest, based on that core appeal that had worked so naturally before.
2905100	2909100	Although many hypothesise this had been brought on by their mutual dislike of Keem,
2909100	2912100	they refrain from mentioning him until the end of the show.
2913100	2916100	Ethan- We can talk about Keemstar, whatever you want.
2916100	2920100	Trisha- Love you, much drama alert? Should we shout it out, promo?
2920100	2921100	Ethan- Drama alert?
2921100	2922100	Trisha- Yeah, what up?
2922100	2924100	Ethan- You wanna give a shout out to drama alert?
2924100	2927100	Trisha- Nothing but love, we're all peace and positive here.
2927100	2928100	Ethan- Yeah, Keemstar's the best.
2928100	2933100	It was welcomed with opened arms by their audience, but with circumstances and characters in mind,
2933100	2936100	I'm sure many wondered if it was going to survive beyond a couple episodes.
2936100	2940100	Ethan and Trisha's working relationship often seemed borne out of a mutual cause,
2940100	2943100	and it's not that a cause like that can't be worthwhile,
2943100	2946100	but the question is what happens when that cause is ultimately fulfilled,
2946100	2948100	like it was with The Bachelorette?
2948100	2951100	If this podcast was the result of other factors like Keemstar,
2951100	2954100	what happens when the influence of those factors inevitably lessens?
2954100	2957100	There had to be something deeper between Trisha and Ethan,
2957100	2959100	but could they ever find it?
2959100	2963100	Well, let's talk about the centrepiece of Ethan and Trisha's tumultuous relationship.
2971100	2975100	In a way, Frenemies was a concept that was constructed of Trisha and Ethan's established rapport.
2975100	2978100	The fact that on one hand they'd had friendly conversations,
2978100	2980100	they'd had productive discourse on certain matters,
2980100	2984100	but they'd also had their fair share of drama and fallings out after they had seemingly record-styled.
2984100	2987100	The question on many people's minds was how do you keep a podcast going
2987100	2990100	with two people who may hate each other on a certain day,
2990100	2992100	who may not talk for months?
2992100	2995100	Well, money maybe, but even then, if you're not really committed to something,
2995100	2997100	it tends to shift.
2997100	3001100	Even then, if you're not really committed to something, it tends to show.
3023100	3026100	However, in the first episode, there clearly was a commitment involved.
3026100	3030100	They even had their impersonalised set to contrast between the two creators,
3030100	3034100	Ethan on that brooding dark side, and Trisha with their pink-spirited jollity.
3034100	3037100	I mean, to be honest, that's not an accurate representation of their style,
3037100	3041100	but I suppose that is the sort of energy they tend to emanate at least.
3041100	3046100	In that introduction, Ethan emphasised that these two were drawn together for that unique chemistry,
3046100	3049100	seemingly debunking the idea that this was a tactical decision on his part.
3049100	3052100	There was acknowledgement that this could go pear-shaped very quickly,
3052100	3055100	but both seemed to have an understanding of the potential outcomes,
3055100	3058100	intrepidly embracing them, and from the first minute of the first episode,
3058100	3062100	that quirky chemistry that everyone seemed to identify was on exhibit.
3062100	3086100	In a way, though, this time it was intended.
3086100	3089100	It's not like Trisha didn't mean what they had said in the past.
3089100	3094100	It meant that this environment was actively fostered in acknowledgement of its subsequent public release.
3094100	3099100	A friend of his episodes is basically a compilation of the conversations you have with your friend.
3099100	3102100	In all honesty, you'd be afraid to ever provide a public platform.
3102100	3107100	But Trisha was that friend who already had the platform, so in a way, people almost felt more permitting,
3107100	3109100	because it wasn't like they had much to gain from it.
3109100	3115100	In return, Ethan Handel gallantly found an aspect for his podcast that he had been desperately missing in the past.
3115100	3117100	That raw chemistry.
3117100	3145100	He'd finally shown his critics that he could actually do something that many doubted he could.
3145100	3151100	I think the problem with his previous intues was that Ethan and Hila aren't the best at starting conversation,
3151100	3155100	and when dealing with more stoic guests, this tended to lead to some awkward interactions.
3155100	3158100	Trisha was probably the most world-curious guest they had,
3158100	3162100	and Trisha always provided Ethan with at least ten zany comments to find one response to,
3162100	3164100	which Ethan could always do.
3164100	3169100	The highs yielded quality banter, excellent repartee, and chemistry for the ages.
3169100	3172100	However, with the sunshine came the rain.
3182100	3185100	Surprisingly, the first four episodes went without major incident.
3185100	3191100	However, the fifth build as a Halloween special is where the greasy wheels appear to detach from the ramshackle machine.
3191100	3195100	Trisha has a habit of going nuclear rather quickly, and I'll discuss why in a moment,
3195100	3202100	but whenever they feel slightly attacked, they seem to fight back with a thousand times the ferocity of that which was initially launched on them.
3202100	3209100	In this case, during a discussion on transparency, Trisha brings up the subject of Ethan's substance abuse to prove that he's not as open as he claims.
3209100	3214100	Ethan, feeling blindsided by this comment, accuses Trisha of weaponizing his problems against him.
3214100	3217100	This strikes a nerve with Trisha, and it quickly goes downhill from there.
3226100	3228100	I've never said anything like that to him.
3228100	3230100	I've seen your group chats. I literally see his phone.
3230100	3234100	Well, you bragging about looking through his phone isn't exactly the best look.
3234100	3236100	I'm not bragging about it. I'm stating something because, once again, I'm open.
3236100	3239100	Well, I've never said anything like that. I'm trying to resolve this because-
3239100	3242100	The more we talk about it, the worse it's going to be. Like, good luck. Honestly, good luck.
3242100	3246100	Thanks for having me on five episodes. Love it. It was so much fun, and I'm over it.
3246100	3250100	Good luck, and I'm sorry about your family situation. I'm sorry about your situation.
3250100	3251100	I know you're miserable.
3251100	3252100	No, it's not true.
3252100	3254100	You are. I can tell. I can tell, and it's sadness.
3254100	3256100	And I see you when I was around your family that you have sadness in you, and it's sad.
3256100	3257100	Okay.
3257100	3259100	And that's why you're so mean to people on the internet, and I get it,
3259100	3262100	but also don't take it out on people and call them crazy and shit.
3262100	3267100	Well, we're going out on a high note here, folks, all for your viewing pleasure.
3267100	3270100	Just wire me for this later, and we'll talk never.
3270100	3275100	Because I just- I hate people just like- that are you. You're the person I hate in this world.
3275100	3276100	Really?
3276100	3278100	That's so just offensive, but they do nothing wrong.
3278100	3281100	And when people are provoked, oh, they're crazy, calling girls crazy and stuff like that.
3281100	3285100	It's like- but taking no accountability, no responsibility.
3285100	3287100	You think everything's just an attack against you, everyone's against Ethan.
3287100	3289100	Like, oh my gosh, I'm always right.
3289100	3292100	It's like, ugh, you and Jax won't serve each other, so.
3292100	3295100	Jax? I can't believe you're going after Jax. He's such a sweet guy.
3295100	3297100	Bye, love you.
3297100	3298100	All right, Trisha.
3298100	3300100	All right, bye. Thanks for the great episode.
3300100	3304100	It's quite a sight to behold Ethan perched there in his Uncle Fester costume.
3304100	3308100	But visuals aside, this did spawn a situation that clearly troubled those involved.
3308100	3310100	For some, this would be drama, this would be funny.
3310100	3315100	But for the podcast, this was the surfacing of a problem that has been present with Trisha for years,
3315100	3318100	and it definitely brought into question whether this dynamic was healthy.
3320100	3323100	I'm gonna try to do a post-mortem on this.
3325100	3327100	I don't know, maybe she's just having a bad day.
3327100	3331100	I haven't spoken about it too much yet, and I don't want to speak about it too much in general,
3331100	3335100	but Trisha has been quite open about their struggles with Borderline Personality Disorder,
3335100	3342100	a condition that alongside other symptoms can cause intense emotional instability and impulsivity in individuals affected by it.
3342100	3345100	This has obviously been demonstrated in certain scenes of the podcast,
3345100	3350100	and when you see Trisha storm off, some would draw that what you're actually witnessing is an episode of BPD,
3350100	3354100	and question whether it's actually ethical that we're even witnessing what's going on.
3354100	3359100	Everyone accepted that this time around these sorts of interactions were a very real possibility,
3359100	3363100	and in an attempt to preserve that raw nature to make sure that we're receiving the full picture,
3363100	3365100	even the ugliest parts are left in.
3365100	3369100	Yet, although that rawness was in itself an appeal for many viewers,
3369100	3374100	it also led some to question whether this was really fair given Trisha's own personality disorders,
3374100	3378100	given that these outbursts were thought to be a symptom of the condition in question.
3378100	3383100	It's a commonplace discussion because on one hand, you never want to rob an individual of their agency,
3383100	3388100	and let me make it crystal clear, Trisha consented to be on the podcast from its inception to its cessation,
3388100	3391100	however at the same time when you're walking around topics that could trigger someone,
3391100	3395100	when you're on a podcast that actively acknowledges that it could become nasty pretty quickly,
3395100	3399100	you also have to make sure you're not just carelessly exploiting that.
3399100	3403100	Although I think anyone would be pressed to say that Ethan ever went out of his way to torment Trisha,
3403100	3409100	also doing nothing about that sort of dysfunctional environment could be seen as passively allowing that toxicity to thrive,
3409100	3414100	which although spectacular points, doesn't really do much good for you, Trisha, or anyone else who works on the podcast,
3414100	3419100	and the moment you stop taking those outbursts seriously, then you risk enabling that behaviour as well.
3419100	3425100	This was an emergent problem that was going to cause a very imminent demise if something wasn't done about it.
3428100	3434100	If these were normal podcast episodes, then these disruptions would have likely been the end of Trisha and Ethan's friendship
3434100	3438100	for at least another few months, and at first it did seem like Trisha was not going to be returning to the podcast,
3438100	3442100	however given that they had this partnership going, this was something that worked to an extent,
3442100	3446100	I think it gave both parties a greater impetus to try and maintain it.
3446100	3449100	At the same time, doing nothing wasn't the best option either, and in the episode following,
3449100	3455100	the tension between the two was still palpable, with Trisha reluctant to open up to Ethan again after their heated exchange.
3463100	3469100	Although there was progress throughout the episode, it felt like something more needed to be done to keep this alliance healthy and productive,
3469100	3472100	and by the next show it seemed like Ethan had found the solution.
3478100	3483100	Allow me to introduce you to this man then, his name is Drew Pinsky, but is more informally known as Dr Drew.
3483100	3489100	He has a renowned media personality and internist, which basically means that you specialise in treating a variety of elements
3489100	3494100	of the body without the need for surgery. Some people use the term physician interchangeably with it,
3494100	3496100	in case you're more familiar with that term.
3496100	3501100	Dr Drew is recognised for a plethora of programs, most notably Loveline, a phone-in show where he would provide
3501100	3505100	relationship, medical, and miscellaneous advice to listeners and callers alike.
3505100	3511100	At its peak, it was incredibly popular, and Dr Drew was generally perceived as offering pretty decent guidance to those who requested it.
3511100	3516100	Since his discontinuation in 2016, he's continued to make appearances on a variety of broadcasts,
3516100	3522100	and has established himself online and on YouTube. On the surface, it seemed like he was a man with fairly solid credentials,
3522100	3528100	so with all this in mind, he was the sort of person who may be able to resolve, or at least ease the conflicts between Trish and Ethan.
3528100	3534100	So, on the 27th October, he was brought on for enemies to help address that rift that had grown between the two hosts.
3534100	3536100	Would he be up to the test?
3543100	3548100	On one hand, the discussion appeared to go pretty well. Drew showed an interest in Trisha that allowed them to open up,
3548100	3552100	and they appeared to make progress on perhaps patching up old wounds. There's discourse on drug abuse,
3552100	3558100	and as an expert on that front, Dr Drew really comes into his element. In many ways, I can see that this was useful for the two.
3558100	3563100	On the other hand, there is a glaring issue. Dr Drew is not a therapist, and although he's knowledgeable,
3563100	3567100	he lacks the tact that is typically aspired for by those in that profession.
3567100	3574100	I feel like we have amazing chemistry, and I see the goodness in you, and I know that you're always fighting to bring that out,
3574100	3580100	more than when you get upset, or you do this and that, and the stuff you regret. I don't ever see that as who you are,
3580100	3583100	I know who you are, and I love that person as a friend of mine.
3583100	3585100	Okay, well thank you.
3585100	3590100	I said it was Ethan's idea to bring Dr Drew on because he seems to take credit for bringing him on at the start of the video.
3590100	3595100	However, if this hadn't been explained, you would be forgiven for thinking that this individual was drafted in by Trisha.
3595100	3598100	I don't want to do that, I don't want to hurt anyone, even in my relationship now.
3598100	3602100	I am trying to sabotage it to not make it last, because I don't want to be harmful to anybody,
3602100	3605100	and I am, I'm dangerous to myself, I'm dangerous to other people, and it's bad.
3605100	3610100	Okay, so Ethan, can you see how when you say something like this is a weaponized, you're attacking me,
3610100	3614100	that's tough territory for her right now. You got it?
3614100	3615100	Yeah, no.
3615100	3616100	You understand? Okay.
3616100	3617100	Yeah, for sure.
3617100	3618100	So here's the deal.
3618100	3622100	Now I don't want to necessarily place all the responsibility onto Plinsky immediately,
3622100	3629100	because I accept that there was the possibility that Ethan briefed the Doctor in a specific way that would make him more drawn to sympathy on Trisha's end.
3629100	3634100	However, even some of the comments that he makes seem to be slanted or strangely passive aggressive.
3634100	3636100	Oh damn, Tana's looking pretty good.
3636100	3637100	Okay, stop it, stop it.
3637100	3638100	Okay.
3638100	3639100	Oh my goodness.
3639100	3644100	So, so, Immerse, so, I didn't know her at all, I didn't even know her name, and then I did that.
3644100	3647100	You're one of those people on the internet, my man.
3647100	3648100	Wait, me?
3648100	3649100	No, no, he is.
3649100	3650100	Oh, thank you.
3651100	3653100	Feeling free to attack people he doesn't know.
3653100	3654100	Exactly.
3654100	3656100	Wait, what do you mean one of those people?
3657100	3665100	One of those people that I'm swatting off every day, that doesn't understand that people that are out there on the internet are actually people.
3665100	3671100	I will preface by saying that I'm not a therapist, but I have experienced therapy, and I'd like to think I know a thing or two about working with people,
3671100	3676100	and one of the things that you should be doing as a therapist is helping someone open up.
3676100	3681100	Immediately antagonising someone publicly, even in semi-jest, is not going to do that.
3681100	3688100	It's not the only snarky remark he makes, and it really feels out of place for what he's been asked to do, however my issues don't end there.
3688100	3694100	One of the endless problems with Dr Drew are these closed statements that fail to explore a person's feelings.
3694100	3700100	I really don't want to go too much on a tangent here, but it's really important that a patient can find closure in their own judgement,
3700100	3702100	even if you've directed them there in a way.
3702100	3708100	The problem is, when you end the discussion of a particular topic prematurely, even if you think you've wrapped it up,
3708100	3713100	the discomfort in that person will linger, whether it's discomfort with your judgement, or doubt of their own judgement.
3713100	3717100	It's not a healthy place to leave someone, particularly if you directly conflicted with their own opinion.
3717100	3720100	Drew, you could tell me if I need to apologise or not on this one.
3720100	3721100	She looks like a Twinkie!
3721100	3723100	Alright, this is what Bonnicon was promoted as.
3723100	3725100	Apology warranted?
3725100	3726100	Um...
3726100	3728100	The yellow outfit was the...
3728100	3733100	In a weird way, that's making too much of nothing, which is, guess what, photographs lie.
3733100	3738100	And if we don't know that by now, then caveat emptor, you know what I mean?
3738100	3742100	And I think, I don't know that woman, I mean if you feel like you hurt her feelings, you should apologise.
3742100	3744100	You don't want to hurt her, I'd assume.
3744100	3746100	I don't think I've hurt her feelings, I think you just...
3746100	3748100	Yeah, I don't think she cares.
3748100	3755100	Right, so I don't think it's a big deal, but there is something to be learned from that, which is that photos lie, videos lie too.
3755100	3762100	Dr Drew kinda establishes himself as an authority in providing opinions on topics throughout the episode, and that's not really right.
3762100	3767100	Ethan doesn't handle this the best admittedly by thrusting the emphasis on whether he should apologise to Pinsky,
3767100	3770100	but at that point you as a therapist need to step in and say,
3770100	3777100	hey, it's not my job to arbitrate these specific situations, it's my job to help you arbitrate them yourselves.
3777100	3781100	Nobody needs to know Dr Drew's opinion on this subject to find resolution.
3781100	3784100	This isn't to say that he can't express feelings about certain matters,
3784100	3787100	and in many places he speaks with power to subjects that are helpful,
3787100	3791100	but he often seems too driven to make a judgement before all the facts are on the table.
3791100	3792100	Case in points?
3792100	3796100	Okay, there was an issue, this is a whole different issue, but I had an issue with my boyfriend, which is his brother-in-law,
3796100	3800100	with private DMs, he exposed all these private things, so there's no boundaries when it comes to me.
3800100	3801100	No, I get it.
3801100	3805100	But as soon as I bring up something private with him, then what triggered me was his like,
3805100	3807100	whoa, you're weaponising, oh my god, you're being abused and crazy now.
3807100	3809100	Yeah, I never weaponised anything against him.
3809100	3812100	No, no, no, you told me I was weaponising when all of a sudden I thought that was our relationship,
3812100	3815100	just saying whatever, just everything's out in the open, so I was like, okay.
3815100	3816100	That's what I thought, so she's confused.
3816100	3820100	It confuses her to not know where you're supposed to draw the line, right?
3820100	3821100	Yeah, I was shocked.
3821100	3827100	Okay, but don't you see why me now would never say anything like that to you in private?
3827100	3831100	I can see that, but the same thing, you read private text messages I sent only to you.
3831100	3839100	Hold on, hold on, Ethan, Ethan, not saying things in private to her because of that does not make you an open person, right?
3839100	3844100	You can't say, I'm totally open about everything, but I can't trust you, so I'm not going to be open.
3844100	3849100	It's okay, you don't have to tell everybody everything, but don't claim that you're wide open and telling everybody everything.
3849100	3852100	She's the one that's really wide open, too much, too much so, right?
3852100	3854100	I agree, I do agree with that.
3854100	3858100	Ethan has expressed a direct disagreement with what Trisha's recalling.
3858100	3864100	At that point, you have to unravel that, otherwise you can't be certain that the image that is being projected is an accurate one.
3864100	3868100	Instead, Dr Drew takes Trisha's word as gospel and moves in with his thoughts,
3868100	3872100	but without addressing the fact that this judgement may be based on presuppositions that aren't exactly true,
3872100	3876100	there's no guaranteed validity, and once again, no guaranteed closure.
3876100	3883100	If there's a sensitive personal subject that had previously been publicly revealed, that's very different to one being exposed for the first time.
3883100	3887100	In a way, Dr Drew is somewhat disadvantaged in judging these situations.
3887100	3893100	He is unfamiliar with the podcast, he clearly hadn't watched the situation transpire as he is approaching it with fresh eyes.
3893100	3898100	However, when you do that, you also need to know that someone's word may not be completely accurate,
3898100	3902100	and if you assume it to be right, you risk never bridging that divide.
3906100	3912100	Oh, and I've gotten help for the past year because I had two mental hospital stays where I was put on a 5150.
3912100	3915100	So like, I go into these, like...
3915100	3916100	These states.
3916100	3920100	Yeah, like, it's like a blackout where I'm like, not that person.
3920100	3921100	Yes.
3921100	3924100	And like, that was the first time that happened, so now that that's out there on the internet,
3924100	3929100	like everyone thinks that's just me, that I just like, abuse people, and it's like, it's never been that far.
3929100	3933100	It's difficult when dealing with Trisha because you don't want to risk triggering an episode,
3933100	3938100	but at the same time, you also want to be careful when dealing with someone whose narratives can be somewhat unreliable.
3938100	3943100	You could be providing life-changing advice, but it wouldn't matter if it's under false pretenses.
3943100	3949100	The presentation of this is couples counselling, but by the end it has really transformed into Trisha's counselling,
3949100	3953100	with the occasional input from Klein, and maybe it makes sense given that Trisha has more issues,
3953100	3958100	but when you're trying to repair that bond, there has to be some semblance that you're keeping a couple on even footing.
3958100	3960100	They have to be in this together.
3961100	3964100	Yeah, I can see why your relationships don't work out.
3964100	3966100	I can see why you've been with the same person for 12 years.
3966100	3967100	Thank you.
3967100	3970100	You have no other options, and quite frankly, I don't blame you.
3970100	3973100	Ethan may have had problems in how he interacted with Trisha.
3973100	3976100	He knew that friendlies needed conflict, but it's a fine line to walk,
3976100	3980100	and it's fair to say that at points he may have crossed a few sensitive boundaries.
3980100	3983100	However, it was a shared change that needed to be undertaken,
3983100	3986100	and even with the understanding that Trisha was working on themself,
3986100	3990100	they still had a commitment to the podcast as well if they wanted to maintain it.
3990100	3993100	Nonetheless, towards the end we appear to be moving in that direction,
3993100	3996100	as there seem to be heartfelt comments from both co-hosts,
3996100	4000100	expressing remorse for previous hostility, and expressing desire to build from that.
4000100	4002100	I do, I feel horrible.
4002100	4006100	I do apologise for being so nasty, like from the pill thing,
4006100	4010100	because I know how that feels, and I apologise for trying to be tough and badass,
4010100	4012100	and talking about Ela and everything.
4012100	4014100	I always feel bad, like I feel bad about it,
4014100	4017100	when it's not in a joking mode, when it wasn't, when you triggered me, I felt bad.
4017100	4019100	When I was like, good luck, trying to get your wife pregnant,
4019100	4021100	it was just a mean thing, I don't know what it was, and I'm sorry,
4021100	4023100	and I feel bad, like that's not me.
4023100	4027100	It's not the last time you'll do it.
4027100	4032100	At the end, you may have been given the impression that this was actually a proper reconciliation,
4032100	4036100	with Klein and Paytas thanking Dr Drew, committing to another episode with him in the future,
4036100	4039100	and the podcast ending on a considerably triumphant note,
4039100	4041100	but it all felt a bit hollow to me.
4041100	4043100	Maybe that's with the context of where we are right now,
4043100	4046100	but even then it's very difficult to take anything at face value,
4046100	4051100	because even becoming invested in this progression requires an assurance that we wouldn't end back in this place
4051100	4053100	that caused this episode to occur,
4053100	4056100	and I wouldn't think that everyone was prepared to invest themselves in that,
4056100	4058100	especially given the difficulty of acquiring the truth,
4058100	4061100	and how Trisha even presented that in the podcast.
4061100	4063100	It felt like we could end up here again,
4063100	4065100	and lo and behold, we did.
4065100	4067100	Yeah, Hila was watching and she said,
4067100	4070100	why didn't you tell her that she had powder on her lips?
4070100	4074100	I was like, I mean, I was staring at it the whole time.
4074100	4076100	You're so mean.
4076100	4079100	On my screen it just looked like a glint on your lip gloss.
4079100	4081100	In the beginning I said you have powder on your lips,
4081100	4084100	but then you didn't get it all off, and the whole episode I was just staring at.
4084100	4086100	Can we have Hila as a guest on our podcast?
4086100	4088100	No. She's busy. Don't talk about Hila.
4088100	4091100	We're cutting this part out. She doesn't want to be talked about.
4091100	4093100	Are you fucking serious?
4093100	4095100	We have to cut this.
4095100	4097100	That's fucking crazy.
4097100	4099100	Like, what's even the point in the one we talked about?
4099100	4101100	Because she doesn't like that you're always bringing her up
4101100	4103100	and saying how she doesn't like you and all this shit
4103100	4105100	because it's not true and she finds it annoying
4105100	4109100	because she doesn't want people to start thinking that she doesn't actually like you.
4109100	4111100	Well, she doesn't. Whatever. It's so fake,
4111100	4113100	and that's why H3 is not what it was,
4113100	4115100	because you guys are fake as fuck and cut things out.
4115100	4117100	Okay, you're like on a thing now.
4117100	4119100	I'm not. I just think it's so fake. It's so bullshit.
4119100	4121100	It's like, oh, let's talk about everything.
4121100	4123100	Ask not to be included.
4123100	4125100	And I'm respecting her request.
4125100	4127100	Ben, I'm not talking about anything personal anymore.
4127100	4129100	I won't talk about Moses. I won't talk about me.
4129100	4131100	Like, it's just, whatever. Who cares?
4131100	4133100	Should we...
4133100	4135100	Cut it. I didn't cut all of it. I literally couldn't kill us.
4135100	4137100	It was approaching Christmas when another frack has occurred,
4137100	4141100	this time over the topic of Hila not wishing to be spoken about on the podcast.
4141100	4145100	Both involved seem to try and fail to de-escalate the situation at different points,
4145100	4147100	causing discussion to rapidly intensify,
4147100	4149100	culminating in Trisha storming out
4149100	4151100	and making some exceptionally strong comments.
4179100	4203100	Over the next few days, Trisha put out videos elucidating on their feelings.
4203100	4205100	These videos were long-winded and not the clearest.
4205100	4207100	Some of them are very angry, some of them are sad,
4207100	4209100	but they all highlighted one thing,
4209100	4211100	that Trisha was struggling with their identity,
4211100	4213100	and often didn't know what portrait they wanted portrayed on the podcast,
4213100	4217100	yet they didn't feel like they had a choice in many capacities.
4217100	4223100	I don't like pushing myself for the sake of drama for the show.
4223100	4225100	I don't mind it to be.
4225100	4229100	I don't mind, obviously, I love Ethan and find Ethan funny.
4229100	4231100	I like our dynamic.
4231100	4235100	You know, it's very similar to when I was friends with David Dobrik.
4235100	4239100	I liked the poking.
4239100	4241100	I think it's fun.
4241100	4243100	I think it's entertaining, obviously.
4243100	4245100	People find it entertaining.
4245100	4247100	And I like it.
4247100	4251100	I find it somewhat stimulating to have an opponent, if you will.
4251100	4257100	But I do think Ethan pushes me to get this reaction of me walking out.
4257100	4259100	Me walking out is something I don't like.
4259100	4261100	This seemingly caused a lot of anguish within them,
4261100	4263100	and in many ways it looked like the only solution was to quit,
4263100	4265100	with Trisha even acknowledging it as a viable option.
4265100	4267100	However, after the success of Dr Drew's first appearance,
4267100	4271100	our expert was once more called in to settle their feud,
4271100	4273100	this time alongside Dr Mark Young,
4273100	4275100	an expert on entertainment and business.
4275100	4279100	Well, Dr Drew was already pre-booked for this appearance,
4279100	4281100	it just coincided with the pair falling out,
4281100	4283100	so I guess it all fell into place.
4283100	4287100	However, this episode was definitely more contentious than the last.
4287100	4289100	There are obviously tonal issues that I've previously discussed,
4289100	4293100	but many of people's problems come down to the core message of the episode.
4293100	4295100	It's two hours, and I'm not going to be talking about all of it.
4295100	4297100	Watch it yourself if you dare.
4319100	4325100	Arriving a wedge between Moses and his family.
4325100	4327100	There's one more piece that I think is important.
4327100	4331100	When I ask Moses, when Hila asks Moses about it,
4331100	4335100	Moses says, I didn't say that.
4335100	4337100	Yeah, that's actually not important.
4337100	4341100	The main question posed is how these two should be dealing with Trisha's outburst.
4341100	4345100	Now on Trisha's front this is a difficult question for sure,
4345100	4348100	but this is why you need someone who's actually an expert in this field.
4348100	4352100	Dr. Drew for all his abilities and qualifications is not,
4352100	4354100	so the focus often turns to Ethan,
4354100	4357100	where the discourse quickly becomes focused around how he should deal with Trisha,
4357100	4360100	but Dr. Drew's advice on this front also falls short.
4360100	4361100	You just will.
4361100	4364100	And Ethan, your job is to not respond to splitting.
4364100	4370100	Yeah, but she's driving, but I can't, if she's my wife.
4370100	4373100	I gotta get on your case for this one.
4373100	4376100	You are allowing the wedge to be put in the place.
4376100	4378100	She is doing what she does.
4378100	4382100	She is doing her splitting thing, and your job is to go, uh-huh.
4382100	4388100	You know also, Trisha, that one of your things is unregulated aggression, hostility.
4388100	4390100	Once it gets going, it goes, right?
4390100	4391100	Yeah.
4391100	4394100	And then Ethan somehow can't handle that when that happens.
4394100	4395100	I can handle it.
4395100	4399100	Well, no, you escalate it, as opposed to just containing it.
4399100	4401100	You gotta watch the clip.
4401100	4405100	The whole mantra of merely moving on from inflammatory behaviour seems rather disagreeable.
4405100	4410100	Maybe if they were both 10, it would be some wise old parenting adage, but they're not.
4410100	4413100	You are allowed to assert boundaries at this stage of a supposed friendship.
4413100	4418100	It's almost like Drew believes that any other action other than rolling over is innately provocative,
4418100	4420100	and that's just not true.
4420100	4424100	As a matter of fact, you could well be enabling toxic behaviour by not at least challenging it.
4424100	4428100	Personality disorders may make you more predisposed to certain behaviours,
4428100	4431100	and it may help understand and explain actions,
4431100	4434100	which is why it's important to approach these situations with sympathy,
4434100	4436100	but it is never an entire explanation,
4436100	4441100	because the moment it becomes that you're not only painting all those people with personality disorders in a bad light,
4441100	4444100	but you are giving a person a blank check to let it happen again.
4444100	4448100	So you shouldn't take offence when you don't know what's what.
4448100	4452100	You just can't take offence to stuff when people are just talking.
4452100	4459100	Later, if you're able to substantiate these things and find out that Moses is not trustworthy,
4459100	4463100	or does feel the way that Trisha's telling you, well then it's something to talk about.
4463100	4466100	But in the meantime, it's just whatever, don't react.
4466100	4471100	In a way, I think the problem comes down to the fact that Dr Drew has been brought on to save the podcast,
4471100	4475100	and maybe the only viable option in their mind is for Ethan to appease Trisha,
4475100	4477100	but it's not a healthy option long term,
4477100	4481100	and maybe in this scenario, the only way to save their actual substantive friendship
4481100	4483100	is to seek real therapy for each other,
4483100	4487100	and maybe not have every single interaction be a public spectacle.
4487100	4491100	I think, first of all, I'm willing to admit my mistake.
4491100	4496100	I should have definitely talked to you about this before we started recording.
4496100	4497100	I should have said, hey-
4497100	4500100	Can I stop you right there? That does not feel like you mean it.
4500100	4503100	Oh, it doesn't? I do mean it.
4503100	4505100	Make it really clear that you mean it,
4505100	4509100	because this will come back around to hurt you if she isn't convinced that you mean it.
4509100	4513100	One of the greatest issues of this generation of Hollywood experts and wannabe therapists
4513100	4517100	is that they are better at being media personalities than they are at dealing with real people
4517100	4520100	who wouldn't typically deal with their issues in the public spotlight.
4520100	4523100	I think it's completely acceptable to provide live advice in a format
4523100	4525100	that allows you to keep the person seeking advice anonymous,
4525100	4528100	or at least not make them the centre of the matter at hand.
4528100	4531100	However, when you're applying a very personal type of therapy,
4531100	4534100	you need more than charisma to make sure that what you're saying is actually helpful
4534100	4537100	for those who will inevitably take those words to heart.
4537100	4538100	Especially someone like Trisha.
4538100	4541100	What we were watching wasn't therapy, it was theatre,
4541100	4544100	and it was questioned whether the people involved were better off for it.
4544100	4547100	But I feel like with each of these blowups, you guys get,
4547100	4552100	I wouldn't say closer together, but it helps you guys manage your relationship better.
4552100	4555100	Also, this is the bullying builds character of 2020.
4555100	4557100	What a ridiculous statement.
4568100	4570100	Tell me what you think about the truth about what I mean by that.
4570100	4571100	You're asking me right now.
4571100	4572100	Because you're not being honest.
4572100	4574100	Okay, but do you want me to reply? I will be honest,
4574100	4576100	but I don't want you to be like, you're attacking my parenting.
4576100	4577100	Do you want my honest opinion?
4577100	4579100	No, because you said, well, okay.
4579100	4581100	You say, okay, well, your mom should be here then.
4581100	4584100	I do think I would have my mom watch over a nanny.
4584100	4586100	I don't trust strangers with my personal experience.
4586100	4588100	I don't think your nanny's the worst.
4588100	4589100	I'm just saying my personal experience.
4589100	4593100	This is not the exact conversation that happened,
4593100	4595100	and I don't think it's productive to go over it now.
4595100	4596100	Well, you just asked me.
4596100	4598100	Did you not just ask me to give you my opinion on this?
4598100	4599100	And that's what I'm saying.
4599100	4600100	Do you really want me to tell you?
4600100	4601100	I will.
4601100	4602100	I have no problem with it.
4602100	4603100	We already talked about this.
4603100	4606100	Okay, but you just asked me to give you an opinion again about it.
4606100	4607100	I heard your opinion.
4607100	4608100	I heard it.
4608100	4609100	I don't care to share it again.
4609100	4611100	I'm just saying like, if he wants me to reply, I will.
4611100	4618100	Because it's very obvious that she was in that moment digging as deep as possible.
4618100	4619100	I was not digging it.
4619100	4620100	He was pushing it.
4620100	4621100	Okay.
4621100	4622100	Okay.
4622100	4625100	Now, a lot of Frenemy's audience really resented Trisha immediately after this episode,
4625100	4629100	particularly given that Dr Drew's advice seems slanted in their favour,
4629100	4632100	but I find it hard to blame them in many ways for the actual advice they received.
4632100	4635100	The buck stops at self-proclaimed experts in this case,
4635100	4637100	and it's not like they're completely in the wrong.
4637100	4642100	Trisha does deserve sympathy, but just not in a way that invalidates how Ethan feels.
4642100	4647100	If Ethan was the therapist type, then maybe he'd be able to handle Trisha in a way that doesn't affect him,
4647100	4651100	but he's clearly bothered by Trisha's behaviour because Ethan is not a therapist.
4651100	4653100	In fact, sometimes he can be quite the opposite.
4653100	4657100	H3 is a hypocrite, because he said n***a on his podcast.
4657100	4662100	It's like, dude, you are fucking, you call yourself a news source, like get fucking real.
4662100	4667100	You know what, if you think I'm wrong, if you think that I'm a racist and a hypocrite,
4667100	4671100	if you didn't bother to watch the podcast and you downvoted and you left a mean comment
4671100	4674100	and you called me a hypocrite, fuck off.
4674100	4676100	Unsubscribe.
4676100	4678100	Don't watch.
4678100	4681100	Because we'll have a lot less of that shit to deal with in the future.
4681100	4684100	Team Star, the pinnacle of logic and sanity on YouTube.
4684100	4686100	I have a strange relationship with Ethan Klein.
4686100	4689100	I was always a massive fan of his work with H3H3 Productions,
4689100	4693100	and I don't think my appreciation for his content has ever fully dissipated,
4693100	4698100	but I do think the podcast kinda revealed to me that he had a few more layers than those which were displayed on the original channel,
4698100	4701100	and in a way, it's not exactly a massive surprise.
4701100	4704100	He always had the ability to be quite pointed towards people,
4704100	4706100	I mean, that's how he first came into conflict with Trisha,
4706100	4709100	but when it's in that environment, you can always write it off as comedy.
4709100	4714100	On the podcast, it didn't always feel like that, it can come across as quite cynical and trenchant.
4714100	4717100	I think sometimes that can provoke people, mostly people who aren't there,
4717100	4720100	but still, if you're doing a podcast with a person who is easily provoked,
4720100	4722100	then maybe you should be more considerate,
4722100	4726100	but at the same time, you also need to retain some sort of sense of self,
4726100	4728100	otherwise you're gonna be holding yourself back,
4728100	4732100	and I think the challenge posed to Ethan after this episode was one of great magnitude,
4732100	4735100	yet although I've made it clear that I think Dr Drew's advice was subpar,
4735100	4739100	I think Ethan seemed to find his own resolution that worked quite well for a bit.
4740100	4746100	What we have here today is the steamies, as if drinking the piping hot steamy tea.
4746100	4748100	Oh, I thought it was like a steamy dump.
4748100	4751100	Yeah, that also went through my head.
4751100	4754100	You can think of it either way, it's a steamy dump, it's a steamy tea.
4754100	4760100	What it is, is the real award show of 2020 that you wish was here,
4760100	4764100	but the steamies are too much cowards to actually cover what matters.
4764100	4769100	The next episode after Dr Drew was the steamies, a self acclaimed honest spin on the streamies,
4769100	4773100	an award show where all the fantastic influencers celebrate their successes.
4773100	4776100	However, in the steamies, these awards were a bit more ironic,
4776100	4781100	with Trisha even being in attendance to pick out their award for the most dramatic creator,
4781100	4782100	what a coincidence.
4783100	4788100	47.1% Trisha Banks!
4788100	4791100	Wow, you won, here it is.
4791100	4798100	Most dramatic creator of the year, they love you, they really love you.
4799100	4813100	And we have a very own Frenemies styled rhinestones steamies presented to you.
4813100	4820100	We're going to have to get this engraved for Trisha Paytas, most dramatic creator of 2020.
4820100	4821100	Congratulations.
4821100	4824100	Their first video of the new year seemed to follow in a similar direction,
4824100	4826100	and it helped they have the substance to work with.
4826100	4829100	Frenemies is under attack, that's going to be the title, it's going to be really good.
4829100	4831100	Frenemies is under attack, okay I like that.
4831100	4833100	It's true though, it's true.
4833100	4837100	Most two of YouTube's most controversial personalities is creating new conversations about mental health.
4837100	4839100	That sounds good, right?
4839100	4844100	I don't like being a poster child for like mental health, all of a sudden it's like BPG and mental health.
4844100	4847100	I agree, I don't like it either, we're just two friends doing a podcast.
4847100	4850100	I did watch your H3 live a little bit about someone saying like,
4850100	4855100	I just hate that that's what it's about, like how dare he collab with a girl with a mental health issues.
4855100	4858100	It's not like I killed somebody and I should be like locked in prison forever.
4858100	4862100	You see, over the Christmas parade, their squabbles and subsequent attempts to patch it up
4862100	4864100	had caught the eye of certain publications and creators,
4864100	4868100	who felt that the content published on the Frenemies podcast bordered on exploited.
4868100	4873100	Ethan as the chief organiser of topics comes in with the spin that Frenemies is under attack,
4873100	4877100	maybe a bit hyperbolic, but it provides a springboard for them to reinforce their bond.
4877100	4880100	I think in this case it works, uniting them around a cause.
4880100	4883100	Ethan also goes out of his way to reassure and support Trisha.
4883100	4885100	A lot of people really appreciated this,
4885100	4890100	they used this momentum to transition into a really good segment in it where they just watch old clips of Trisha on TV,
4890100	4895100	something that I absolutely adore, maybe it's just my love of game shows, but it's really wholesome.
4895100	4897100	The entire episode is actually quite great,
4897100	4901100	and many people commented how refreshing it was that they genuinely seemed like friends here,
4901100	4906100	and I began to think, maybe Dr Drew's advice wasn't the best, maybe his tone was too blase for most,
4906100	4911100	but maybe it's what made Trisha the happiest, maybe it's what made them the most confident going into the podcast,
4911100	4916100	and maybe it provided a sense of resolution on that identity issue that they had expressed conflict over.
4916100	4921100	Therapy isn't a one-size-fits-all method, and if Ethan's main goal was to keep the podcast going,
4921100	4926100	and he still seemed to have a good time, then who was I to judge? Maybe I was being too critical.
4926100	4929100	Yeah, they're like, if you touch her, you'll be escorted off, like mid-show, we don't care.
4929100	4932100	I was like, okay, and then I touched your own ass, and I was like, oh no!
4932100	4936100	What a diva, you're just Ellen, you're just a TV host, you're not the fucking queen.
4936100	4937100	I know, I was so nervous.
4937100	4940100	Wait, I didn't, okay, see, this is great, I'm glad we're doing this.
4940100	4945100	The episodes after this seem to be continuing in this vein, and people actually seem to be preferring this style.
4945100	4948100	It still seemed pretty sharp and witty, but what a change.
4948100	4949100	What about all the Beatles?
4949100	4952100	Well, I think John Lennon's the only one that said that they're bigger than God.
4952100	4954100	They all corroborate with it.
4954100	4956100	To be honest, they kinda are bigger than God.
4956100	4960100	I think God is the biggest.
4960100	4963100	Okay, name one song he's made.
4963100	4965100	Well, not much on the surface.
4965100	4971100	Ethan didn't seem to become a shell of himself like some were probably worried, and Trisha seemed a lot more optimistic going into the new year.
4971100	4976100	However, I do think the awards show illustrated one of Ethan and Trisha's greatest combined strengths,
4976100	4982100	that although their spontaneity had its own appeal, they worked their best when they were building off and reacting to other material.
4982100	4989100	It's a very simple observation at its core, but all of the worst arguments seem to begin when Ethan and Trisha become too fixated on themselves,
4989100	4994100	and their own conduct, procedure, and sometimes that of the podcast and those close to them in the moment,
4994100	4996100	typically when one of them took it personally.
4996100	5001100	Sometimes it's a hard discussion to avoid, given Trisha's nature to go off on tangents about their personal life.
5001100	5005100	Nonetheless, I think that Ethan came into 2021 with a refreshed sense of focus.
5005100	5010100	Although they both were still somewhat easily distracted, he would often bring the video back to the core thesis.
5010100	5016100	He didn't allow himself to be pulled away towards subjects that could lead down a problematic path, and I think that was definitely beneficial.
5016100	5021100	I also think that with the new year and the new drama, there was a new purpose.
5021100	5026100	Things seemed to be looking up for once, and whoever was responsible for it should have given themselves a pat on the back.
5026100	5032100	Maybe Dr Drew was the therapist we didn't want, or the therapist we needed, but were we missing something?
5044100	5049100	Here's the thing, there were a lot of theories at the time that Trisha and Ethan played up that drama for the camera,
5049100	5052100	which is in a way what they were responding to that episode.
5052100	5057100	Some believed there was a financial incentive to do so, and it's not like that theory holds no water,
5057100	5060100	those moments did tend to receive more publicity from the podcast and other sources,
5060100	5065100	but they were so successful without that conflict, it wasn't necessary for their collaboration subsistence,
5065100	5072100	and often with the fate of the podcast on the line, it's not a boundary worth pushing, the long term trade-off was not worth it.
5072100	5078100	If anything, the content at the start of 2021 showed that frenemies have the ability to be just as successful without hostility,
5078100	5085100	and I think this movement towards a more cemented friendship was almost enough in itself, and very satisfying for audience members to watch.
5085100	5092100	Now make no mistake, they were also helped by an influx of drama which covered creators that Trisha and Ethan both had interactions and history with,
5092100	5098100	ranging from Shane to David Dobrik to James Charles, and when pickings were this plentiful, they didn't have to skimp out on topics.
5099100	5102100	She was upset that I was going to make out with Seth, and so I flipped out.
5102100	5110100	You being mad about the Seth make out thing is crazy. It's crazy. It's crazy.
5110100	5111100	Is it?
5112100	5115100	Was that real? Like him saying it's crazy three times, or is that edited?
5115100	5117100	No, that's the clip, unedited.
5120100	5124100	Not being comfortable with it, and here's the footage, and not only you saying you're not comfortable with it,
5124100	5130100	but David was, I mean, look, people misuse gaslighting all the time, this is gaslighting.
5130100	5131100	Right, right, right.
5131100	5134100	Because you know something's wrong, and he's trying to convince you that you're crazy.
5134100	5135100	Right.
5135100	5140100	However, this didn't mean that they didn't share more personal moments or tackle difficult subjects.
5140100	5143100	In fact, as I've shown, Ethan really went out of his way to support Trisha.
5143100	5149100	They even had an episode where Trisha spoke about many of their struggles growing up, which at the time seemed pretty riveting.
5149100	5156100	We weren't close. My dad was in California when we lived in Illinois, and my mom, I had issues with my stepdad, so that was my main focus.
5156100	5162100	Well, not my stepdad, one of her boyfriends, and so that was my main focus at home, and then I tried to say stuff, and then I was like, oh, I'm not going to say anything.
5162100	5165100	My mom worked for a job, so we were by ourselves all the time.
5165100	5168100	She worked at the country club. She was a bus driver. She was a substitute teacher.
5168100	5173100	She worked so much, and so her boyfriends would be home or whatever, but it was bad.
5173100	5178100	It was, you know, I thought if my own principal doesn't believe me, no one's going to believe me.
5178100	5181100	You're not a pathological liar anymore.
5181100	5183100	Pathological? What's that?
5183100	5185100	You said you're a chronic liar.
5185100	5188100	Oh, like you think I'm lying about this now? No, I'm not lying about it.
5188100	5193100	I just am asking because I know people are going to be like, she admits she's a pathological liar, and you can't trust anything she says.
5193100	5197100	Um, like when I was younger, but I'm not now. I don't lie. I make a really conscious effort to not...
5197100	5199100	I believe everything you say. I don't think you're a liar.
5199100	5204100	Many people really felt like Trisha was beginning to change as a person, and in a way, they definitely were.
5204100	5211100	They were being nice to Ethan, tolerating his assertive comments, saying a lot of genuinely sweet things that many viewers found legitimately endearing.
5211100	5215100	However, I'll bring it back to Dr Drew, and the notion of mutual change that I felt was a bit neglected.
5215100	5219100	At the end of the day, Ethan certainly was capable of doing more to accommodate Trisha,
5219100	5224100	and if you would rather cater to Trish than ask more of them to keep the podcast going, then I think that's justified.
5224100	5228100	But there was still one element that I think Trish needed to provide, and that was trust.
5229100	5235100	I think my trust with, like, influencers in general, like, I really thought they were my friends, so when you kept being like,
5235100	5240100	I'm here for you, I'm your friend, and I was like, uh, you know what I mean? I feel like maybe a lot of that is...
5240100	5244100	I think there's plenty of other things that caused trauma in your life before that, though.
5244100	5248100	I think that they really... I went to a mental hospital for the first time in my life after David and Jason.
5248100	5254100	It should be no surprise that with their history and their dispositions, Trisha isn't a very trusting person,
5254100	5261100	and in a way, it's not like I blame them. I think it's very difficult to trust people when you've had that trust abused in the way that Trisha seems to express it.
5261100	5266100	However, Ethan isn't like those other people, and I have my problems with Ethan, make no mistake,
5266100	5272100	but sometimes a weakness can also be a strength, and one of my criticisms is that Ethan can play favourites a little too much.
5272100	5278100	Now everyone is biased, however, I think Ethan is unreasonably harsh towards some people, and far too lenient with others.
5278100	5285100	Particularly in the episodes where they were covering drama, Ethan really used an aspect of himself to go at many people Trisha had expressed issues with,
5285100	5292100	really asserting his loyalty, but Pater's reaction often showed there was still an inkling of doubters to Ethan's sincerity.
5292100	5300100	It always just fell short of the heartfelt moment, at which point you began to wonder if there was anything Ethan could do to break through.
5300100	5319100	Trisha isn't a stranger to making sassy comments, but they always seemed like a way to shift the tone of a conversation
5319100	5324100	and prevent themselves from showing that vulnerability and trust that may allow someone like Klein in.
5324100	5329100	You could tell their wall was built high, and in a normal world, many would say that this is profoundly illogical.
5329100	5336100	Even if you loathe Ethan, all logical roots would point towards his desire to maintain good terms with Trisha, beyond the podcast as well.
5336100	5341100	The personal investment was significant, especially given Trisha was now Moses's fiance.
5341100	5345100	Hell, they even did a whole couples episode, with Hila making an appearance as well.
5345100	5348100	Alright, Ethan and Trisha first.
5375100	5385100	In many senses, Ethan was bending over backwards to stand up for Trisha.
5385100	5390100	He gave them a platform to speak on certain matters, he believed them, he advocated for them at every opportunity.
5390100	5395100	This caused backlash of points, particularly when he went toe to toe with other creators over dramatic matters,
5395100	5402100	particularly when people didn't believe Trisha's testimonies, which outside of the H3 fanbase was still a significant online presence.
5402100	5407100	In numerous episodes where David Debrick and the Vlog Squad are addressed, Trisha has a lot of history and baggage with them,
5407100	5411100	and much of that is aired to the point where Trisha claimed that lawyers were becoming evil.
5433100	5448100	Ethan was prepared to antagonise himself to certain audiences if it meant backing his partners,
5448100	5454100	with Skep soon billing him as opportunistic and only siding with Trisha because of their status and the revenue it brought.
5454100	5459100	Now, I'll give my own subjective opinion on it in due time, but it was divisive then,
5459100	5465100	but between that divide, Ethan sided with Trisha. Was Trisha completely on Ethan's side?
5465100	5482100	Well, in episode 29 there's this interesting interaction where Ethan makes a comment directed towards Trisha about their weight.
5482100	5488100	Trisha then retorts by insulting his hair, this then leads into a rather elongated discussion about which one of them is fatter,
5488100	5497100	all in all it seems like a pretty inconsequential conversation, until around 40 minutes later when Trisha decides to retract their statement and apologise for their previous comment.
5518100	5524100	At that moment it seems like quite a nice gesture, but there's a catch.
5549100	5553100	Now, if you believe that Ethan should have apologised for his comment then fair enough,
5553100	5557100	but it's a strange situation because those sorts of jokes never seemed off-limit prior,
5557100	5563100	and as Ethan points out, the expectation that someone else should apologise for something isn't a good motive for an apology.
5563100	5568100	The point is though that he didn't apologise, and there's a moment of awkwardness while Trisha processes Ethan's response,
5568100	5572100	and you just have this feeling that something still isn't quite there for them.
5572100	5578100	Ethan was only prepared to compromise on so much, and it was unclear whether Trisha was fully satisfied with that.
5578100	5582100	The End
5595100	5598100	With acknowledgement to the previous part and everything life said in it,
5598100	5603100	The Frenemies episode still seemed headed in the right direction, with an energy that did become more positive.
5603100	5607100	It still seemed viable that Trisha would finally settle in the place that they were,
5607100	5613100	with the people they were with. The absence of those more large-scale conflicts would make many believe we were perhaps
5613100	5618100	approaching calmer waters, and no one could really be blamed for expecting anything else.
5618100	5622100	At the start of episode 37, Trisha seems in rather high spirits.
5622100	5627100	They mention that there had been an argument with Klein, but both parties express reluctance to delve into details,
5627100	5632100	and they seem happy to move on from it. Maybe people noted how exuberant Trisha was during this episode,
5632100	5634100	maybe even a bit too exuberant.
5635100	5640100	So anyway guys, head on over to Trisha, or sadboy2005.com
5640100	5645100	This is our first collab, we have four more collabs coming out this year, and then we're gonna start our own in-house stuff.
5645100	5651100	Daddy First is definitely an inspiration. I've always wanted to do a clothing line, but I never saw anyone do it.
5651100	5655100	Not that it's easy, but seeing you guys do it, I was like, this could be attainable. You know what I mean?
5655100	5660100	I feel like, I don't know. Anyways, I'm really excited. I feel like the quality is good.
5660100	5665100	Everything's hand stitched, hand printed, like this is hand dyed, this is hand sprayed on, yeah.
5665100	5668100	They dyed this, this purple and blue.
5670100	5675100	Someone questioned a few of the comments made during this podcast on whether they were completely alright,
5675100	5678100	with someone wondering if they were having a manic episode.
5678100	5684100	Regardless, as good as their mood appeared to be, there was one talking point they did briefly stop on.
5685100	5689100	They're about they're about equal kind of a point for me. Oh, my God.
5692100	5705100	Technically, we because you didn't actually anyways, you know, I pay logistic, but you get a little extra from front of me said to pay the crew. So we pay them for Mondays. You did tell me that. Oh, so I pay them to from our earnings of interesting.
5706100	5714100	The arrangement between the two split the podcast profits 55% to 45% in Ethan's favour, with 5% going towards production costs.
5714100	5719100	In exchange, Ethan also claims that he organises the episodes and does the rest of the work.
5719100	5727100	Trisha decides that this isn't really a topic for discussion right now, and although Ethan persists a little longer, the conversation subsides shortly after.
5727100	5732100	It seems like a mostly trifling detour, one of many, but I'll put a pin in it for future reference.
5732100	5740100	The next episode is a mostly entertaining, albeit uneventful vlog, where Trisha continues to impress people with their encyclopedic knowledge of Hollywood.
5750100	5759100	They're actually right, fair play. Anyhow, I digress, though once again Trisha does scold Ethan for not coming in costume, it all seems fairly friendly, and I shan't dwell on it.
5759100	5762100	I think we should turn our attention to the next episode.
5776100	5782100	In this episode there is a pretty significant development in the client's personal life, that being that Hila is now pregnant.
5782100	5790100	The podcast's reaction seems fairly elated, and Trisha seems equally excited for the both of them, even being surprisingly self-aware about their emotional response to the news.
5790100	5812100	I think a lot of people have retrospectively tried to read into Trisha's response here, but honestly nothing seems particularly out of the ordinary.
5812100	5819100	Trisha seems pretty hyped about the release of their new music video, which is an homage to My Chemical Romance, and it was Pride Month as well.
5820100	5827100	Maybe everything was turning out just as we had hoped, two couples, both happy and healthy, making their way in the world and rooting for each other.
5827100	5834100	In spite of all the uncertainty, this may have been the completion of the arc that we had followed, but not all endings are as happy as we'd like them to be.
5834100	5839100	It's difficult when you're watching these videos at that moment to really know exactly what's going on between them,
5839100	5844100	and it was completely understandable that people had the impression that Ethan and Trisha were consolidating their friendship.
5844100	5848100	The topics yielded a lot of unifying moments, and they seemed closer than ever in many ways.
5848100	5852100	The incidents that I have picked out in the previous part didn't happen on a rather regular basis,
5852100	5857100	but they still underlined that failure to take the final step to put that trust in Ethan's hand.
5857100	5863100	There was still that doubt as to whether Ethan could give Trisha what they wanted, but what did Trisha want?
5863100	5878100	One point that I've covered a while back was one of Trisha's first appearances on the podcast.
5878100	5888100	They've always had a slightly strange dynamic with Ethan often switching between an I hate you stick and an off-puttingly flirtatious vibe that wasn't always met with approval by those who interacted with it.
5893100	5920100	Now, I'm not here to say that I think Trisha ever hailed strong feelings for Ethan, although some people hypothesised it.
5920100	5924100	I think their often quirky behaviour in that domain could be put down to past interactions.
5924100	5931100	At the same time, I think there was definitely an expectation that at that point of the podcast, they would be the priority.
5931100	5936100	I don't mean this in a romantic sense, but I think as they became more and more familiar with each other,
5936100	5941100	Trisha seemed to develop a belief that they would have more influence on the general identity of the podcast itself,
5941100	5945100	and they would be able to direct it rather than being this guest for hire.
5945100	5951100	Trisha is an extremely distrusting person, and wherever there was something that seemed to bother them, some discrepancy in their mind,
5951100	5956100	they would use it to fuel their own doubts, and to cut themselves loose from the person that they believed to be the source of that.
5956100	5963100	I think Trisha, like many people, almost became enslaved by their own expectation, that expectation for the podcast to crash and burn.
5963100	5968100	Every now and then they'd make these comments that invited Ethan to rise to the insult, or escalate them even,
5968100	5974100	in a way that would provide them with some justification of completely severing that tie, freeing them from the obligation.
5974100	5978100	It was a technique that often died down, and was even sometimes resolved shortly after,
5978100	5985100	but if the mood was right, or wrong even, it was the sort of thing that could spiral, and in episode 39, it did.
5985100	5991100	Alright, so anyway, I mentioned the name of the person who's finally ready to talk about Gabbie Hanna today.
5991100	5994100	Talking about Gabbie Hanna, what could possibly go wrong?
5996100	6002100	Unlike other episodes with instants, what we were about to witness wasn't immediately apparent judging by the thumbnail and title.
6002100	6006100	This may be due to the fact that Ethan didn't want to make it seem like he was cashing in on the conflict,
6006100	6012100	or perhaps because Ethan didn't view it as second to the much more prominent conversation relating to the titular subject,
6012100	6016100	Gabbie Hanna, a person who may have helped bring Trisha and Ethan together in the first place.
6016100	6020100	Episode 39 starts like many episodes do, unexceptionally.
6020100	6025100	Trisha doesn't seem to be quite as energised as previous episodes, but it's not out of the realms of normality.
6025100	6028100	Ethan is ominously dressed in an unconfessed costume again,
6028100	6033100	have barely a few minutes in, and Trisha is already dissatisfied at the affairs relating to their costumes,
6033100	6036100	seemingly frustrated by the lack of control they have over its selection.
6059100	6065100	This goes on for a couple minutes before they reach some sort of resolution where Ethan commits to doing more Trisha's costume suggestions,
6065100	6068100	and the next half an hour passes without major incident,
6068100	6072100	though Trisha does make a few comments towards Ethan about the procedure of the podcast.
6083100	6086100	However, one comment in particular that should have set up some red flags was this one.
6089100	6104100	Here Trisha is setting a mark up, they are not in a good mood, they have a lot of hate in their hearts,
6104100	6108100	and at that point Ethan tries to ease any tension by jovially reassuring Trisha,
6108100	6111100	though they don't seem particularly heartened by his attempts.
6111100	6114100	There's a skit shortly after which seems to cut through any agitation in the moment,
6114100	6118100	but the topic of Gabbie Hanna, someone who Trisha has only stated they do not really like to discuss typically,
6118100	6121100	given they believe Gabbie is stalking them, is a bold choice.
6121100	6124100	It certainly seems to play into their sense of paranoia,
6135100	6141100	how the conversation manages to tangentially end up at the ever-popular topic of pizza, and they bond over that.
6141100	6144100	It seems the mood has been restored, and all is well once more,
6144100	6149100	but then we cut to the ad segment, and we notice an empty chair alongside our festery friend.
6149100	6152100	He explains the situation, and he doesn't seem too distraught about it,
6152100	6156100	describing the incident as a little blowout, and proceeding with the routine ad reads.
6156100	6161100	However, regardless of the scale of this clash, it was obviously a departure from the conflict-free record,
6161100	6164100	and many were left anticipating the inevitable, and what exactly would spawn it.
6164100	6169100	While the topic of Gabbie Hanna continues, and while they both seem to have some sort of rational grasp on the topic,
6169100	6172100	they do venture through some subjects that Trisha clearly finds triggering,
6172100	6176100	particularly regarding an interview which they felt wasn't completely in good faith.
6176100	6179100	Trisha seems to take this quite seriously, but also quite soberly,
6179100	6181100	and Ethan provides his standard support,
6181100	6186100	though they do seem to dwell on points that may be considered a little morbid for someone of Trisha's paranoid disposition,
6186100	6188100	perhaps not the best choice.
6188100	6191100	We can't, there's no steamy nomination for her either, we cannot mention her ever again.
6191100	6193100	Most likely to assassinate Trisha Paytas.
6193100	6194100	Stop!
6194100	6195100	And the winner is...
6195100	6198100	And then we invite her up, and we give her a knife as a reward.
6198100	6202100	Stop! That's why I bring security, I have security guards that come with me everywhere, I'm not kidding.
6202100	6204100	She will show up.
6204100	6207100	Most likely to kill Trisha with this knife.
6207100	6208100	So scary.
6208100	6213100	With all that said, there is the idea that Trisha being able to vent may have been able to lift that weight off their shoulders,
6213100	6216100	and they seem to express this sentiment of greater stability as well,
6216100	6218100	since cutting certain toxic people out of their life.
6218100	6223100	Even my aura, my stability in my mind, the fact that I can handle triggers.
6223100	6224100	Good auras.
6224100	6228100	Do you know what I mean? Yeah, and I've gone to therapy, I've been going to therapy since 2019, so you could say therapy,
6228100	6233100	but at the same time, I'm like, I really think since I really left that, everything's been so much better.
6233100	6234100	Very interesting.
6234100	6237100	Yeah, everything, like health, like money, like everything just flows friendships.
6237100	6241100	But then, not too soon after the pizzas arrived, there were signs of discontent.
6241100	6246100	No, I got black olives, pineapple, and jalapeno, and it's insane. So good.
6246100	6251100	Wait, no, not my discontent, Trisha's discontent, though we are gonna have words about those pineapples, Ethan.
6251100	6255100	No, the real problem arises when Trisha begins to talk about Brokeback Mountain,
6255100	6260100	a romantic drama about two cowboys who've become romantically intertwined in a rather unaccepting environment.
6260100	6265100	Trisha was clearly very invested in the plotline, and also the narratives that were still relevant to this day in their mind.
6265100	6270100	Ethan, however, becomes a little distracted by the pizza, and the awkwardness radiates through the screen.
6270100	6273100	There's still, people are still like that, like trans people arguing feet in their face to death.
6273100	6275100	Oh, I'm so over that shit.
6275100	6283100	And so like watching it, I was just like holy shit, and like Heath Ledger, Jake Gyllenhaal said Heath Ledger refused to make like gay jokes about it like during the Oscars, and I don't know.
6283100	6284100	Is there a third pizza?
6284100	6286100	You're so not good about this.
6286100	6288100	I just want to make sure that everyone got pizza.
6288100	6290100	I don't like this segment, just for the record, fan advice is so stupid.
6290100	6294100	It's a little rude on Ethan's part given the subject, but it's nothing that needs to escalate.
6294100	6297100	How Patricia, clearly feeling wronged, decides to go in.
6297100	6302100	I never pick the costumes, I never do the vlogs, I give so many ideas, I say dancing for the vlogs, I give all these ideas, and you don't.
6302100	6303100	What's wrong with the advice?
6303100	6304100	I don't think it's a good segment.
6304100	6305100	The people want to hear from us.
6305100	6306100	Okay, do it.
6306100	6311100	I'm telling you my opinion and all the vlogs we've done, I've suggested other vlogs and like that never does.
6311100	6313100	Well if you don't like it, then we shouldn't do it.
6313100	6314100	Okay.
6314100	6315100	In terms of the show about me and you.
6315100	6317100	No, but you're saying I do all the work, but I'm telling you I don't like all the stuff you do.
6317100	6322100	I'm just kind of go with it because I'm like, okay, I guess this is what you want to do, but I have to start saying no, because some things are just not good ideas.
6322100	6329100	Although this feels like a rather dramatic change in tone, you can tell that these are frustrations that have been boiling up, particularly given their prior mentions.
6330100	6336100	Although Ethan feels like he does the heavy lifting, Trisha clearly doesn't feel like they've been given the chance to, and is quite blunt about it.
6336100	6339100	They also don't think the material for the podcast is original enough.
6339100	6341100	But you're asking like, we do all the work.
6341100	6347100	It's like we spent one friend of me rehashing all the stuff you said about Keemstar and H3 Live, which was two days prior.
6347100	6348100	Okay, it happened one time.
6348100	6352100	No, it's happened before where you just like bring up stuff that you already mentioned and it's fine.
6352100	6353100	Why are you attacking me?
6353100	6357100	You asked me, you said tell me, and I'm telling you like all your, just because you guys come up with everything doesn't mean it's good.
6357100	6359100	It's recycled, a lot of it, so it's like I can come up with new ideas.
6359100	6360100	Not a lot of it.
6360100	6361100	A lot of it.
6361100	6362100	No.
6362100	6363100	Mm-hmm.
6363100	6364100	If you have ideas, I'm all ears.
6364100	6366100	I watch H3 Live and we talk about the same thing, and I'm happy to talk about it.
6366100	6367100	It's not always like that.
6367100	6368100	It's happened before, I agree.
6368100	6369100	It happened last time.
6369100	6370100	It's happened a lot.
6370100	6372100	Sometimes I forget what I've talked about, honestly.
6372100	6377100	But you're saying you have all this crew that does all this work for you, and nobody could remember that you talked about that two days prior?
6377100	6378100	I agree.
6378100	6379100	Somebody should have said something.
6379100	6382100	I was like, guys, why don't you tell me when I'm talking about the same shit over and over?
6382100	6384100	Because I tell to them, I go, yo, make sure to include this.
6384100	6387100	And they go, okay, but I go, oh shit, I talked about the same thing.
6387100	6393100	Ethan defends himself on this front, though conceding on one point, while asking Trisha to be a bit more honest with their emotions,
6393100	6398100	something which then prolongs this tension, eventually leading into the dreaded discussion surrounding revenue split,
6398100	6400100	which once again comes back to the notion of control.
6400100	6402100	But I feel like you're so angry about this.
6402100	6404100	I'm literally not, but it's so funny.
6404100	6405100	At least you are.
6405100	6406100	I'm not, I'm angry when you say something.
6406100	6407100	You need to admit when you're angry.
6407100	6409100	Ethan, I promise you, this really is gaslighting.
6409100	6411100	I go to a lot of therapy right now, and this really is.
6411100	6413100	When I say I'm not angry, I'm not.
6413100	6417100	I'm just trying to tell you that you're like, oh, we do everything for the show, and I'm saying it's not always good.
6417100	6418100	I'm not angry.
6418100	6420100	If I was angry, I would leave or something, but I'm not.
6420100	6421100	But you're telling me I'm angry?
6421100	6422100	You're upset or something.
6422100	6423100	I'm not.
6423100	6424100	People we hire.
6424100	6426100	Why would I ask you about people I hire?
6426100	6428100	Because it's front of me, and you take the budget for paying for the crew.
6428100	6429100	That's what you told me.
6429100	6431100	You take highlights, you take 5% to pay the crew.
6431100	6434100	So why don't I get any input on the crew or what we do?
6434100	6436100	These are employees of our production company.
6436100	6438100	So why are you taking highlights and 5% in front of me?
6438100	6440100	You told me that it was to pay them.
6440100	6442100	It's for production costs.
6442100	6447100	Okay, but you told me at the beginning, it's like they could be working on other things.
6447100	6448100	So I made that argument, too.
6448100	6449100	I'm like, well, they're already age 3.
6449100	6450100	Oh, they could be working on other things.
6450100	6451100	So I'm like, okay, in that case-
6451100	6452100	It's for production costs.
6452100	6461100	I take 5% extra from the podcast revenue, and I take the highlights revenue, and everything else we split.
6461100	6463100	Right, so for production costs.
6463100	6465100	Yeah, and so we had to buy-
6465100	6467100	But that was the first time we ever spent money on production costs.
6467100	6469100	It's not about that, dude.
6469100	6472100	It's literally about we are producing the show, and I'm taking a cut.
6472100	6474100	I feel like that's beyond reasonable.
6474100	6475100	All the highlights.
6475100	6476100	Beyond reasonable.
6476100	6477100	5%.
6477100	6478100	5%.
6478100	6479100	Do you realize how much 5% was of our last one?
6479100	6480100	That should be enough.
6480100	6484100	But also highlights, and then you weren't the membership I had to fight for because you weren't-
6484100	6485100	Oh, I forgot to tell you about the members.
6485100	6486100	It's crazy.
6486100	6488100	I'm giving you 50% of all the members.
6488100	6491100	Trisha seems rather irritated, despite proclaiming that they're not.
6491100	6496100	And when Ethan expresses this, it only seems to worsen their mood, with Trisha believing they're being gaslit.
6496100	6499100	This then causes them to express doubt regarding Ethan's intentions.
6499100	6503100	And then Ethan, once again giving up, concedes that he must have gaslit her.
6503100	6505100	Because you can be upset and still show up.
6505100	6508100	But I'm not upset, and that's what gaslighting is, because you're saying I'm gaslighting you by saying-
6508100	6510100	I'm gaslighting you. You're not upset. You're perfectly-
6510100	6511100	Oh, wow.
6511100	6512100	You're in a perfect condition right now.
6512100	6514100	But this was a great mistake.
6514100	6516100	Wow. Holy cow, that's crazy.
6516100	6520100	I mean, I don't know how you- I just don't see what you just did. That's really crazy.
6520100	6521100	What did I do?
6521100	6523100	We have to end it now. Like, really.
6523100	6525100	What did I do?
6525100	6527100	I'm gonna stop for real. Really.
6527100	6529100	Okay.
6529100	6531100	Please. Please.
6533100	6535100	Trisha, let me just say, I'm sorry.
6535100	6537100	The fact, Ethan, that you just did that, you're right.
6537100	6539100	You're right. Nothing's wrong with you.
6539100	6541100	That's- but I go- you don't know how much therapy I go to a week.
6541100	6543100	I go to four Zoom sessions a week.
6543100	6545100	I understand, but-
6545100	6547100	Ethan, what you just said was, you're right, Trisha.
6547100	6549100	Everything's fine. That's insane.
6549100	6551100	The fact that you did that to me is like-
6556100	6559100	This is one of the problems with the rollover strategy.
6559100	6561100	Sometimes it's completely the wrong thing to do.
6561100	6565100	In this case, Trisha is expressing a doubt, a product of paranoid thinking.
6565100	6568100	There is no doubt in my mind that Ethan was not trying to gaslight them.
6568100	6570100	He just wanted clarity on how they are feeling.
6570100	6572100	But Trisha continued to push that theory,
6572100	6576100	and in the hopes that admitting it would make it die down, Ethan does just that.
6576100	6578100	The problem is that Trisha doesn't want that.
6578100	6581100	They didn't want to be right in that case, because what they were expressing is something that
6581100	6585100	represents their worst fears, that Ethan is just taking advantage of them and reaping the rewards,
6585100	6588100	and psychologically deceiving them whenever they bring it up.
6588100	6592100	In this case, their thoughts were that by framing their behaviour as angry or frustrated,
6592100	6596100	Ethan was trying to use their emotional response to discredit their legitimate criticism.
6596100	6599100	Although in a difficult spot, Ethan should have stood his ground,
6599100	6603100	explained his perception, and tried to calm the situation through a rational de-escalation.
6603100	6607100	But he did seem tired, and his concession, despite perhaps being a mistake,
6607100	6612100	may have been a reflection of his own mental exhaustion of trying to upkeep a podcast that was taking its toll.
6612100	6617100	With that said, given his sponsor segment, he clearly expected this to be resolved by the next episode.
6617100	6621100	After all, we had seen Trisha evolve a lot as a person in her time on the podcast.
6621100	6624100	Alas, this appeared to actually be the podcast's final episode,
6624100	6629100	as the following morning Trisha announced that they were stepping down from Frenemies indefinitely.
6629100	6634100	Trisha- I get it, I get now he's saying that H3O produces, and he deserves that as a producer,
6634100	6639100	but it's like I would have loved the opportunity to pitch in half for the set to, you know,
6639100	6643100	because I really do feel like I built this show like with them, like at 50-50,
6643100	6646100	like I don't think I'm the main reason because God knows my channel
6646100	6650100	and my podcast doesn't do like what Frenemies does, you know what I mean?
6650100	6655100	But at the same time, like H3O, it wasn't doing what it's doing now either.
6655100	6659100	I feel like I helped build that, like I thought Frenemies, we were building together,
6659100	6664100	like from the beginning was like 5% goes to the, to help the crew,
6664100	6667100	and then the other goes to production class, so I thought we were like building something,
6667100	6671100	like building, it was going to be like a bigger set, bigger things, bigger vlogs,
6671100	6675100	but it's just like, if I knew I was coming in as a third H3O show,
6675100	6679100	like I swear hand to God would not have done it.
6679100	6683100	And then yesterday just, you know, hearing that like, you know, he's the producer
6683100	6686100	and he does everything when I just, I really tried hard to contribute
6686100	6690100	and I really tried hard to like bring my own stuff every week and I feel like I did,
6690100	6695100	I feel like I had topics and stuff and it's just like, it hurt me.
6695100	6698100	As a video, it is extremely incoherent, but it's not hostile.
6698100	6701100	Trisha expressed great regret over the decision they're taking
6701100	6706100	and vents many of the frustrations that seem to be creeping up on them in the final podcast episodes.
6706100	6709100	They felt that Frenemies had become such an independent force of content
6709100	6712100	that they deserved a balanced input, something they didn't have.
6713100	6717100	They in hindsight admit that they were frustrated, but didn't feel like they were in that moment,
6717100	6719100	and obviously didn't respond well to Ethan's comments.
6719100	6724100	They've also felt generally uncomfortable with the crew, and certain incidents have certainly underlined that.
6724100	6729100	With the knowledge that this feeling is mutual, they don't want to return to that environment with anyone walking on eggshells.
6729100	6733100	Although they stand by their gripes, they're clearly upset with how they handled it,
6733100	6738100	and they wish it hadn't ended like that, and they hope they can remain firm friends with Ethan and Hila.
6739100	6745100	I will say for the record, Ethan and Hila have been so freaking kind to me.
6745100	6750100	And I hope it doesn't affect our personal relationship.
6750100	6757100	Because obviously, they are, like, gotta be family.
6757100	6760100	I really love them.
6760100	6764100	But at the same time, I always say, don't work with family, don't work with people you're close with.
6764100	6767100	I kind of feel that, you know, right?
6767100	6772100	As a video, I can understand why some may have issues with its presentation and maybe its message too,
6772100	6776100	but I honestly think that maybe stepping down was the best thing to do here,
6776100	6779100	and Ethan seemed to reluctantly yet graciously accept their resignation,
6779100	6782100	putting out a couple tweets on the matter which expressed disappointment,
6782100	6785100	yet acceptance, stating that he had done all he could.
6785100	6787100	Anyway, it was a bittersweet moment.
6787100	6790100	With this in mind, we could finally bring the Frenemy saga to a close.
6790100	6795100	A nice, peaceful close where everyone remains friends and we can all move forward together.
6795100	6799100	This crazy yet flawed experiment was finally over.
6799100	6802100	May it rest in peace.
6802100	6805100	Yeah, right.
6805100	6807100	There ain't no rest for the wicker though,
6807100	6812100	and as quickly as it seemed the drama came to a peaceful conclusion, it reignited once again.
6812100	6816100	Ethan was clearly unhappy that Trisha announced publicly that they were stepping back from the podcast
6816100	6818100	before speaking to him, which I can understand,
6818100	6820100	and he reached out expressing his own frustrations.
6820100	6824100	Trisha responded to this by posting another video called One More Thing,
6824100	6827100	not the title of their new sad boy song, admittedly.
6827100	6833100	The H3 employees have nothing to do with Frenemies as far as our 5% salary.
6833100	6835100	The 5% thing.
6835100	6839100	Yes, Ethan gets an extra 5% from the main channel, but he also gets 100% of the highlights,
6839100	6842100	so technically 105%, and the highlights make a shit ton of money.
6842100	6844100	I add up the views of our Frenemies highlights,
6844100	6846100	I'm not talking about the H3 highlights, I have our Frenemy highlights,
6846100	6848100	and that's like, it's literally probably half of what we make.
6848100	6850100	It's a lot, I would guess.
6851100	6854100	Anywhere from $50,000 to like $80,000 a month, that's just a guess.
6854100	6856100	I don't know, I don't see the numbers, I never do.
6856100	6859100	And I'm not asking for the crew to be fired, the crew have been so great to me,
6859100	6862100	I'm asking, and Ethan and I came to terms with it last night to have a producer,
6862100	6865100	even if they had a new hire, I would love my sister.
6865100	6869100	There's a couple couples working on a show or whatever,
6869100	6872100	or people related to each other, the 5%, and talking about their salary,
6872100	6875100	and the crew only gets 5%, I have no idea what the group gets paid,
6875100	6878100	I lashed out that I didn't like the ideas, and I lashed out on Ethan,
6879100	6881100	because Ethan is the one that presents me the ideas.
6881100	6884100	I don't know how it works with them, I don't know who comes up with it,
6884100	6887100	I don't know how they brainstorm, I don't know any of that,
6887100	6889100	because I'm not included in any of that.
6889100	6892100	The video is meant to be a clarification on the money matter,
6892100	6894100	though once again, Trisha goes off on various tangents,
6894100	6897100	and it seems mostly unexceptional as Trisha videos go,
6897100	6900100	certainly a departure from the angry Trisha that we had seen before.
6900100	6903100	Ethan, however, feeling that Trisha's responses were quite unsporting,
6903100	6907100	tweeted his frustration, claiming that the video was causing undue hate towards the crew.
6907100	6910100	Now, as a video, it's more defensive than aggressive,
6910100	6912100	and I would be surprised if it changed that much,
6912100	6914100	but once again, that was their experience.
6914100	6917100	Trisha, however, obviously felt hard done by because they believed
6917100	6920100	that Ethan was using the crew as a shield to try and attack their voice.
6920100	6923100	I can understand why this may have bothered them in the moment,
6923100	6927100	but the best thing they could do in that case was to make sure they didn't prove Ethan's point.
6927100	6931100	We all know that when Trisha feels Ethan isn't being just, it will spiral,
6931100	6934100	and from here there were a series of tweets by both parties,
6934100	6936100	mostly Trisha, arguing their case.
6936100	6939100	Many people were urging Trisha in particular to take a step back,
6939100	6941100	especially after DMs began to be published,
6941100	6945100	which actually ended backfiring when people pointed out Trisha's curious use of certain terms.
6945100	6948100	In this case, both sides seemed to relent momentarily,
6948100	6951100	with H3 stating that he needs to take a step back on the night
6951100	6953100	and expressing regret over his tweets,
6953100	6955100	and Trisha doing the same the following morning.
6955100	6957100	Many wanted them to hash this out in private,
6957100	6960100	and with both sides seeming to warp back their conduct a little,
6960100	6962100	it was thought that maybe this would be the opportunity.
6963100	6967100	The problem is that I think Trisha did legitimately feel like they were being treated poorly,
6967100	6971100	and when they're trapped in an environment with someone who they feel is acting without the best intentions,
6971100	6974100	they don't want to combine themselves to that space.
6974100	6977100	Yet, instead of consulting a friend or a reliable third party,
6977100	6980100	they decide to make the internet their trusted confidant,
6980100	6982100	a generally bad decision, not just for yourself,
6982100	6987100	but for the other person who feels that you're betraying their trust by taking it to such a public platform.
6987100	6991100	Social media for Trisha was event space, and not one that was very healthy.
6991100	7015100	The following morning, though, Trisha posted a video titled I'm Sorry,
7015100	7017100	where they channel those regretful sentiments,
7017100	7020100	they apologise a lot and believe it was a misunderstanding,
7020100	7025100	and insist they don't want to be viewed as that hateful monster that they may have appeared as the day before.
7025100	7028100	This is something that they genuinely felt bad about.
7028100	7033100	With both sides back to a more sympathetic stance after a brief moment where emotions overflowed,
7033100	7036100	it seemed that maybe both parties could find closure on this matter.
7036100	7039100	This was the conclusion that we needed.
7039100	7042100	However, it was not the conclusion that we deserved.
7042100	7044100	Why did we forsake God?
7044100	7046100	Hello everybody.
7046100	7050100	Not a typical episode, obviously.
7055100	7061100	Now, for many, episode 39 is technically regarded as the last episode of Frenemies.
7061100	7064100	However, there is one more video in the Frenemies playlist,
7064100	7067100	a video uploaded on the 10th of June 2021,
7067100	7069100	two days after Trisha officially quit,
7069100	7072100	by then addressing much of the drama that had been occurring.
7072100	7075100	He comes into this video with the intent of correcting the record,
7075100	7078100	given that Trisha had been making a variety of public statements.
7078100	7081100	Ethan seemed to be approaching this with the signature peace and love,
7081100	7083100	and not wishing to burn any bridges.
7083100	7088100	So I say with peace and love that, you know, as a friend,
7088100	7093100	I have come to love and appreciate Trisha.
7093100	7099100	You know, as a partner, I think she's one of the funniest people I've ever known,
7100100	7104100	you know, one of the most dynamic and entertaining people I've ever known.
7104100	7107100	She puts me in these tough situations where it's like,
7107100	7109100	I'm losing no matter what.
7109100	7114100	She can say whatever she wants, you know, what she puts out publicly,
7114100	7118100	and then, you know, if I just sit and take it, everything's distorted.
7118100	7123100	And if I say anything, then I'm the bad guy for, you know,
7123100	7126100	coming after something, which is not my intention at all.
7126100	7128100	This, just for the record, is not.
7128100	7131100	The video seems to seek to clarify certain points that were made,
7131100	7132100	first being the employment one.
7132100	7136100	Ethan states that they actually discussed this after the argument on episode 39,
7136100	7141100	and Ethan had agreed to let Trisha bring on a producer to try and ease Trisha's discomfort with the current arrangements.
7141100	7146100	So the day after we shot, after we had like broken up,
7146100	7153100	we had a conversation for the first time ever about her wanting to hire new staff
7153100	7156100	that she would look for and hire to work on Frenemies.
7156100	7159100	That was the first time we had ever discussed that.
7159100	7162100	And after talking it out with her, I agreed.
7162100	7164100	I said, okay, we can, you know what?
7164100	7168100	Again, because I just want to make everything smooth and manageable.
7168100	7171100	We had this big blowout. We talked the evening afterwards.
7171100	7173100	I said, you know what? Let's hire a producer.
7173100	7176100	You tell me who you want to hire, and I'll hire him.
7176100	7180100	His only stipulation was that the situation would be left to settle for a few days.
7180100	7183100	However, the following day, he was blindsided by Trisha's video,
7183100	7186100	which in his opinion undermined the agreements previously made
7186100	7188100	and framed the situation uncharitably,
7188100	7193100	especially given what Trisha had asked for initially was rather unreasonable and disrespectful in his mind.
7193100	7196100	I don't know, from a business partner perspective and a friend perspective,
7196100	7198100	that video really rubbed me the wrong way,
7198100	7204100	because I woke up after having a conversation with her where I agreed that everything she wanted to do,
7206100	7212100	and I wake up to her being like saying all this stuff about private conversations we had,
7212100	7219100	and saying, oh, it's the crew's fault, people on the crew were unhappy, you know?
7219100	7226100	And like, I don't know, I just felt like that video was just so unnecessary,
7226100	7232100	and I just didn't get it, because I had done everything possible.
7232100	7236100	He also clears up some misconceptions as to why the crew were reluctant to shoot the day after,
7236100	7238100	citing that it wasn't due to Trisha's behaviour on set,
7238100	7241100	but actually him feeding comments back to them about Trisha's requests,
7241100	7243100	which he concedes was his fault,
7243100	7247100	or with him taking the final decision to not shoot despite the crew's openness to do so.
7247100	7251100	She told me that she wanted a whole new crew for Frenemies,
7251100	7253100	because she didn't feel comfortable with them,
7255100	7256100	she wanted a whole new space,
7257100	7258100	she wanted a whole new crew,
7262100	7263100	and it just...
7266100	7268100	I don't know, it's like she couldn't meet me halfway.
7268100	7274100	A whole new crew, we need to essentially fire everybody that's worked on this show from the beginning,
7274100	7278100	find a new space, and change everything.
7278100	7281100	This is where maybe I fucked up, okay?
7281100	7285100	Is that I was talking to the crew, like, Trisha wants to,
7285100	7289100	I was like, listen, Trisha wants to hire a new crew.
7289100	7292100	When the crew found out she wanted to fire them all,
7292100	7298100	they were, first of all, they've always been down to go work and do the shoot as we scheduled.
7298100	7305100	They are good, loyal, you know, hardworking employees that are down to get the job done no matter what.
7305100	7310100	I had done a temperature check, like, how do you guys feel about going to do this?
7310100	7314100	Because there was some, there was just people like, you know,
7314100	7318100	the vibe was like, Trisha wants to fire you guys and hire new people to do Frenemies.
7318100	7321100	And also, do you want to go meet with her and shoot tomorrow?
7321100	7326100	And so obviously, they were like, well, it's a little awkward, right?
7326100	7329100	But, of course, I'm willing to do it.
7329100	7335100	So I made the executive decision as their boss, trying to foster a healthy work environment,
7335100	7339100	that let's just not do the shoot tomorrow, bearing everything that's happened,
7339100	7342100	and take a few days to chill off.
7342100	7346100	He states that Trisha's comments about certain things alongside DMs that were leaked
7346100	7349100	had caused people to go out of their way to harass individuals who had not done anything wrong.
7350100	7352100	He expresses solidarity for the people he works with,
7352100	7356100	and reaffirms the stance that Trisha's behaviour was unprofessional in his eyes.
7356100	7358100	I don't think it really matters whose idea it was.
7358100	7363100	The fact that Trisha was just going to sit there and trash their work was kind of unacceptable to me,
7363100	7367100	because ultimately, I have to create a safe work environment for my employees.
7367100	7370100	And it's just kind of toxic to sit there and shit on their work.
7370100	7372100	Whoever did it, it doesn't matter who did it.
7372100	7375100	But the thing is, she keeps harping that in all of her videos to the point where
7375100	7379100	not only is Sam now getting shit on on her social medias,
7379100	7381100	people have gone out of their way and been like,
7381100	7383100	you're the reason Frenemies is over,
7383100	7386100	people are going to AB's wife,
7386100	7388100	people are going to Dan's girlfriend,
7388100	7392100	and just like random spit-firing shit at them
7392100	7395100	with the chance that that's the person Trisha was talking about.
7395100	7398100	And that's just, it's just not acceptable, you know.
7398100	7402100	And this was part of a private conversation that she made public to try to justify
7405100	7406100	why she wanted to leave the show.
7406100	7408100	The crew did nothing wrong.
7408100	7410100	I misunderstood the situation.
7410100	7413100	I told Trisha that people were upset,
7413100	7415100	that she didn't like this segment, okay?
7415100	7416100	I take the blame for that.
7416100	7419100	The reason they were upset that I misunderstood
7419100	7422100	is because she said she wanted to fire them all.
7422100	7425100	They were always willing to do their job, period.
7425100	7427100	They have done nothing wrong.
7427100	7430100	This is all fairly anecdotal, with his own perspective thrown in there.
7430100	7431100	However, the tone changes to the next part,
7431100	7434100	where he seems to address the inherent problem with how Frenemies have become.
7434100	7437100	This idea that Ethan had become a quote emotional punching bag,
7437100	7440100	and while he often had to show restraint in those moments,
7440100	7441100	Trisha had free reign,
7441100	7443100	a double standard in his mind that he lost patience for,
7443100	7446100	venting many of his own frustrations surrounding Trisha's behaviour,
7446100	7448100	including claims about their contributions,
7448100	7450100	their conduct while they were creating content,
7450100	7452100	and their nature to publicise drama.
7452100	7454100	She called my wife like the C-word.
7454100	7457100	She called me, you know, she said the most horrible thing.
7457100	7458100	She said I'm a terrible parent.
7458100	7459100	Hila's a terrible parent.
7459100	7461100	And for me, it's like, okay.
7461100	7465100	And I understand, again, that she has mental health,
7465100	7467100	she has mental, like, health issues,
7467100	7470100	but at the end of the day, it's just not,
7470100	7473100	I don't feel like it's fair.
7473100	7475100	Even though she has those issues, it's just,
7475100	7478100	I can't be her emotional punching bag,
7478100	7481100	and then the minute I speak up for myself,
7481100	7484100	it turns into another, like, show-ending fight.
7484100	7486100	It's just not a fair relationship.
7486100	7490100	I texted her, trying to be mature and handle it personally,
7490100	7494100	like, off the internet.
7494100	7497100	I said, you know, I just want to be honest with you
7497100	7499100	and say I felt it was really unfair
7499100	7502100	how you put that video out, you know,
7502100	7505100	after we worked to try to resolve this.
7505100	7507100	And she ignores my texts,
7507100	7511100	and she posts another 20-minute video 30 minutes later
7511100	7515100	that was in response to my texts that was more like,
7515100	7517100	oh, the crews, the reason why this happened,
7517100	7519100	and sending even more hate to their fucking Instagrams.
7519100	7522100	I don't have, I'm a patient man,
7522100	7524100	but I'm not, like, superhuman.
7524100	7526100	Another problem he communicates is Trisha's nature
7526100	7528100	to not actually confront their problems.
7528100	7529100	Now, we've known this for a while,
7529100	7531100	but in this case, he shows that Trisha did not indicate
7531100	7532100	there were any problems with ideas
7532100	7534100	that they had subsequently trashed on the podcast
7534100	7536100	and after the podcast,
7536100	7538100	including that of the costume and the segment.
7538100	7540100	And it's like, imagine how confusing it is,
7540100	7544100	because she goes on the show, and she says,
7544100	7547100	oh, this questions is so dumb.
7547100	7549100	It's lazy. It's crap. I hate it.
7549100	7553100	I mean, the day before, she retweeted it unprompted.
7553100	7555100	I did not even ask her.
7555100	7561100	That's just really, really difficult.
7561100	7564100	Like, how much she hated the costumes.
7564100	7566100	It was my idea. She never wanted to do it.
7566100	7567100	She doesn't even know the character.
7567100	7570100	She says, I never, I don't even know this character.
7570100	7573100	I sent her this picture. I said, costume idea?
7573100	7575100	She says, laugh my ass off.
7575100	7576100	Oh my God. Oh my God.
7576100	7578100	This is one of my all time favorite movies.
7578100	7580100	Can we? I love her.
7580100	7582100	I don't understand. What am I supposed to do?
7582100	7584100	That's what I mean.
7584100	7586100	It's like, I can't humanly do more.
7586100	7588100	She expects superhuman care.
7588100	7590100	He then continues to explain his justification
7590100	7592100	between the 5% gap between shares
7592100	7593100	and the profit from the podcast,
7593100	7595100	something that he clearly feels
7595100	7597100	he's been quite generous and transparent about.
7597100	7599100	He addresses the DMs that Trisha shared,
7599100	7601100	the investment he made on merchandise,
7601100	7603100	with an escalating tone of exasperation,
7603100	7605100	conveying the frustration at the investment he lost.
7605100	7607100	We pay for the set.
7607100	7609100	We rent the space. We film it.
7609100	7611100	We use our equipment. We employ the people.
7611100	7613100	We edit it. We upload it. We post it.
7613100	7615100	We get that. Sponsors.
7615100	7617100	We develop the concepts.
7617100	7619100	We work all week to prep the segments.
7619100	7621100	We pay for the insurance.
7621100	7623100	We do the accounting and the payroll.
7623100	7625100	I send her a fully itemized report every month
7625100	7627100	of literally everything
7627100	7629100	and how the expenses break down and her cut.
7629100	7631100	And the fact that she would even accuse
7631100	7633100	me of not being transparent is
7633100	7635100	honestly very hurtful
7635100	7637100	because I've gone so far out of my way
7637100	7639100	to be as transparent
7639100	7641100	as possible. I show her literally everything.
7641100	7643100	And then she starts going,
7643100	7645100	I want an itemized breakdown of how that
7645100	7647100	5% is spent. And I'm like, dude,
7647100	7649100	it's not like that. It's just
7649100	7651100	a feat. It's a production feat.
7651100	7653100	I'm not giving you an itemized deduction
7653100	7655100	of the entire business.
7655100	7657100	It's like
7657100	7659100	these absolutely unreasonable,
7659100	7661100	unimaginable bars
7661100	7663100	that I could never reach.
7663100	7665100	She posted a screenshot of herself calling me
7665100	7667100	Julie.
7667100	7669100	For wanting
7669100	7671100	5% to cover the
7671100	7673100	massiveness of this
7673100	7675100	production. We spent $30,000
7675100	7677100	buying all new equipment,
7677100	7679100	cameras, switching board,
7679100	7681100	audio equipment,
7681100	7683100	microphones, everything
7683100	7685100	so that we can continue to do it
7685100	7687100	at the house for her. And she keeps
7687100	7689100	bringing up this like, well, you get 5%.
7689100	7691100	So you should be like, what is that for? You need to be
7691100	7693100	paying. And I say, okay, you know what?
7693100	7695100	Let's keep the show going. Let's do it
7695100	7697100	at the house. I'm going to spend another
7697100	7699100	$30,000 on the already
7699100	7701100	$50,000 I spent on the set.
7701100	7703100	Circles, we are splitting the 30%,
7703100	7705100	which is typically our profit margin. It's like
7705100	7707100	Trisha, just read what I wrote
7707100	7709100	to you. The profit margin
7709100	7711100	is 30%. I'm giving you
7711100	7713100	half of the profits.
7713100	7715100	Do you want 50% of all the
7715100	7717100	revenue? Because I will lose money again.
7717100	7719100	Apparently, you're the only one that's allowed to
7719100	7721100	make money in this relationship.
7721100	7723100	I really don't understand. Although he came into
7723100	7725100	the video with peace and love, it kind of felt that
7725100	7727100	mood waned after the first 20 minutes.
7727100	7729100	If everything he's saying is true, then it's
7729100	7731100	not hard to understand why he feels the way
7731100	7733100	he does. But given what we know, it was not
7733100	7735100	going to temper the situation. Every penny
7735100	7737100	I've made from Frenemies, by the way, if she wants
7737100	7739100	to talk about money, is tied up in this
7739100	7741100	merch that doesn't come out for another month.
7741100	7743100	I don't even know if we're going to
7743100	7745100	sell. So it's like for all the complaining she
7745100	7747100	does for money, she's the only one, as far as
7747100	7749100	I'm concerned, that's actually making money from this thing.
7749100	7751100	Because I've spent pretty much every fucking penny
7751100	7753100	I've made from Frenemies into the show,
7753100	7755100	on merch, into the own resources,
7755100	7757100	buying more equipment for the fucking studio,
7757100	7759100	building the set. It's like
7759100	7761100	it's so easy for her to complain. She
7761100	7763100	shows up, she gets a guaranteed check
7763100	7765100	every fucking month,
7765100	7767100	and I'm putting all
7767100	7769100	my money on the line. And now, I have
7769100	7771100	hundreds of thousands of dollars tied up in merch
7771100	7773100	and I'm probably not going to be able to fucking sell,
7773100	7775100	that my wife works super hard on,
7775100	7777100	her staff works super hard on, and now it's like
7777100	7779100	tough luck, dude. Trisha got paid
7779100	7781100	and she's complaining about 5%. It blows
7781100	7783100	my mind, and I'm upset about it.
7783100	7785100	I am. I can't hide it. I just am.
7785100	7787100	It's just not fair. 5%, when I'm
7787100	7789100	literally not making a fucking penny
7789100	7791100	at this point,
7791100	7793100	it's just, it's just, it's just
7793100	7795100	so disrespectful. It disregards
7795100	7797100	all the hard work we do, not only
7797100	7799100	on the crew, but now on my wife, and all the
7799100	7801100	people that worked on the merch.
7801100	7803100	It's like, okay, well, you know, fuck you.
7803100	7805100	In a way, his own confusion may appear
7805100	7807100	contradictory, because on the one hand,
7807100	7809100	he expresses the fact that he did not want to overhaul
7809100	7811100	the structure of the show to cater to Trisha's needs
7811100	7813100	with the possibility that they could quit any minute.
7813100	7815100	At the same time, he is still frustrated
7815100	7817100	that he has lost all these investments, particularly
7817100	7819100	on the merchandise front. I think it fundamentally
7819100	7821100	comes down to trust. Although
7821100	7823100	Ethan's vexation is to be expected,
7823100	7825100	it was clear that he had still expected this to
7825100	7827100	happen inevitably. He was the producer
7827100	7829100	and the owner, and when you're in that position, you have
7829100	7831100	to be prepared for someone to walk out on a project,
7831100	7833100	and Ethan certainly expected as much.
7833100	7835100	With this in mind, ending the podcast was
7835100	7837100	probably for the best, and although visibly frustrated,
7837100	7839100	he shows resolve in his final decision.
7839100	7841100	I mean, we've gone out of our way
7841100	7843100	in every imaginable way
7843100	7845100	to make her feel welcome, accommodated, listened
7845100	7847100	to, appreciated to, and
7847100	7849100	the truth is
7849100	7851100	that I'm very grateful for
7851100	7853100	the experience we've had with Frenemies,
7853100	7855100	and all the learning, and growing, and
7855100	7857100	helping, and the amazing growth
7857100	7859100	that our channel has seen as the result
7859100	7861100	of that show. I mean, it's been
7861100	7863100	popular and successful
7863100	7865100	beyond what either of us anticipated.
7865100	7867100	And I have so much
7867100	7869100	to thank Trisha for.
7869100	7871100	It is with a heavy heart, you know,
7871100	7873100	that we end the show, and
7875100	7877100	it sucks.
7877100	7879100	It does suck, but
7879100	7881100	you know what?
7881100	7883100	Life goes on,
7883100	7885100	right? We're not stopping,
7885100	7887100	we're only getting started, and
7887100	7889100	I'm sure that Trisha's got
7889100	7891100	a lot of good stuff up her sleeve
7891100	7893100	for you guys as well, so.
7893100	7895100	However, Ethan's video did not sit well with Trisha,
7895100	7897100	and maybe they felt offended by his expectations,
7897100	7899100	maybe they didn't like the framing, but as always
7899100	7901100	they responded, and what we received was
7901100	7903100	a lot of content, but not a lot of substance.
7903100	7905100	I'll add a little note here that when
7905100	7907100	working on research, I was disappointed
7907100	7909100	at reading a part one, as that meant
7909100	7911100	there would be a part two. What I didn't account
7911100	7913100	for was the part three, leaving
7913100	7915100	these response videos at two hours and fifteen
7915100	7917100	minutes in total.
7933100	7935100	It's a clip and response style video where essentially
7935100	7937100	Trisha replies to Ethan's points as he makes them in
7937100	7939100	the video, but responding to the clips as they
7939100	7941100	happen wasn't a good idea, because you need
7941100	7943100	to know what points Ethan is at least going
7943100	7945100	to make before you make your own points.
7945100	7947100	Case in points?
7961100	7963100	Here Trisha reasserts the idea that it's the crew that refused
7963100	7965100	to film. Now with the DMs, we can see why
7965100	7967100	Trisha may have received this impression. With the
7967100	7969100	context that Ethan has provided, we now know
7969100	7971100	that that's not the case, and he doesn't explicitly
7971100	7973100	say that the crew was what was stopping them
7973100	7975100	from filming, more that he thinks they shouldn't
7975100	7977100	film given the situation with the crew.
7977100	7979100	It's a misunderstanding, they happen,
7979100	7981100	but there's no need to perpetuate it when it's
7981100	7983100	cleared up, but these misunderstandings
7983100	7985100	only go further unfortunately.
7997100	8025100	I'm not going to dissect these videos the way I dissected Ethan's video, mainly because Trisha makes a lot of points they'd already made on other platforms, however I will try to give a brief outline.
8027100	8047100	I think Trisha's video ultimately comes
8047100	8049100	down to them wanting to step back because they
8049100	8051100	fundamentally don't understand what they did
8051100	8053100	wrong, and therefore unless they can come to some
8053100	8055100	personal reconciliation, they can't compromise
8055100	8057100	on the belief that they didn't act out of line.
8057100	8059100	They don't think they're demanding, they don't think
8059100	8061100	they're unreasonable, they're not trying to force
8061100	8063100	people to walk on eggshells.
8063100	8065100	But again, this kind of thing, I have to walk
8065100	8067100	on eggshells with you, I have to keep you happy,
8067100	8069100	that's not another reason I don't
8069100	8071100	want to be there, I don't want that work environment,
8071100	8073100	I'm trying to keep you happy, because I don't think
8073100	8075100	I make that many demands.
8075100	8077100	We don't, anything
8077100	8079100	anything they've ever talked to me about
8079100	8081100	I'm just like, yes, yes, yes.
8081100	8083100	It's grown so
8083100	8085100	much, and I'm obviously
8085100	8087100	appreciative of everything he
8087100	8089100	put in to start, but
8089100	8091100	now that that's obviously
8091100	8093100	recouped times a hundred, it's like, can we
8093100	8095100	use some of it, like I get that you're still the
8095100	8097100	producer, or whatever,
8097100	8099100	but like can we use some of it towards
8099100	8101100	you know, building
8101100	8103100	this thing for like, us.
8103100	8105100	They believed the fact that their cut went to production
8105100	8107100	costs should have given them some sort of say in the
8107100	8109100	actual business, and they felt Ethan was unfairly
8109100	8111100	representing the tone of some of their
8111100	8113100	gripes they had with the production. It's clear
8113100	8115100	they wanted for enemies to become more independent
8115100	8117100	from the H3 podcast, a commitment that Ethan
8117100	8119100	didn't want to make, because as previously
8119100	8121100	explored, he didn't have the belief that Trisha was
8121100	8123100	going to stick around. The five percent is
8123100	8125100	brought up, but Trisha also asserts this is in the
8125100	8127100	context that H3 keeps a hundred percent of the
8127100	8129100	highlights profit, something which Ethan doesn't
8129100	8131100	mention in his response video.
8131100	8133100	If some percentage is a hundred percent of the
8133100	8135100	highlights and five percent of the thing is allowed,
8135100	8137100	is allotted for staff, like it would be cool
8137100	8139100	again, to get part time somebody,
8139100	8141100	and if people are hiring their
8141100	8143100	girlfriends, like why not hire my sister?
8143100	8145100	She's like, amazing.
8145100	8147100	From the beginning, he said a hundred percent of the highlights
8147100	8149100	go towards production costs, so I thought
8149100	8151100	that meant, let's get new buildings, let's get new
8151100	8153100	sets, let's get, you know, because that initial
8153100	8155100	investment of 37,000 is a lot,
8155100	8157100	but now that we're like making it,
8157100	8159100	because it's also money that
8159100	8161100	I'm also contributing.
8161100	8163100	Trisha does downplay their message to Ethan
8163100	8165100	about the crew that they had unwittingly
8165100	8167100	exposed the night before, but solidly contends
8167100	8169100	this idea that they wanted the crew fired.
8169100	8171100	You know,
8171100	8173100	there was kind of like a non-starter,
8173100	8175100	is she told me that she
8175100	8177100	wanted a whole new crew for Frenemies
8177100	8179100	because she didn't feel comfortable with them,
8179100	8181100	she wanted
8181100	8183100	a whole new space,
8183100	8185100	she wanted a whole new crew.
8185100	8187100	Okay, so, I honestly,
8187100	8189100	I'm not saying this just to be gaslight, I really don't
8189100	8191100	remember saying I want a whole new crew
8191100	8193100	at all, I
8193100	8195100	like, because I don't have any, I wouldn't
8195100	8197100	have, because he's, the first thing he said to me when I wanted
8197100	8199100	was like a producer for Frenemies, like to focus on
8199100	8201100	Frenemies, he's like, who do you have in mind? I had someone right away.
8201100	8203100	It wasn't a whole new crew to
8203100	8205100	replace people, it was like, let's get a
8205100	8207100	camera guy, like, for our one-off
8207100	8209100	segments on the thing, and they don't do
8209100	8211100	any of that, which is, again, fine, because they're very
8211100	8213100	casual and relaxed, and they're all kind of like this like
8213100	8215100	friend vibe, but it's like, it would be nice to
8215100	8217100	have a producer to be able to like this, this, and this.
8217100	8219100	One person I asked, I didn't say, fire
8219100	8221100	the crew, I didn't, like, I've never
8221100	8223100	ever said that.
8223100	8225100	This is a real sticking point for Trisha, and in a
8225100	8227100	way, it is almost a central narrative to
8227100	8229100	understanding what exactly transpired, because
8229100	8231100	Ethan obviously fed back that notion that
8231100	8233100	Trisha wanted a new crew, and that was what
8233100	8235100	provoked the response from them, that eventually
8235100	8237100	led up to Trisha losing their call in the DMs
8237100	8239100	and quitting the podcast the following morning.
8239100	8241100	If Trisha didn't say that, then Ethan may well
8241100	8243100	have unfairly framed comments they made,
8243100	8245100	even if they weren't very pleasant to begin with.
8245100	8247100	We know Trisha wanted someone in their corner,
8247100	8249100	but that's different to a complete upheaval,
8249100	8251100	and although the DMs certainly don't help their case,
8251100	8253100	there is this unresolved detail that does decide
8253100	8255100	the tone.
8255100	8257100	I want to fire all of them, and get rid of them, and hire a new
8257100	8259100	man, and it's like, okay, well that's not a starter for me.
8259100	8261100	Fuck off, Ethan, fuck off, like this is exactly why I can't
8261100	8263100	even talk to him, because he is, he's such a liar,
8263100	8265100	and he's, like, this is such
8265100	8267100	a lie, and that he keeps perpetuating
8267100	8269100	this, this is what he keeps saying.
8269100	8271100	I've never
8271100	8273100	once said, let's fire the crew, never
8273100	8275100	once said that, on my
8275100	8277100	grave. Now I struggle to comment on this
8277100	8279100	specifically, but going off the evidence, I can't
8279100	8281100	say that Trisha wanted to fire the crew,
8281100	8283100	and I don't think they said that explicitly, but
8283100	8285100	I think given the comments that we have read, Ethan
8285100	8287100	may well have interpreted it that way,
8287100	8289100	especially given how they seem to demean the work the crew
8289100	8291100	had done, and Trisha has a record of trying
8291100	8293100	to push for a particular result without openly
8293100	8295100	stating it, they were clearly unhappy with the
8295100	8297100	current crew. Once again, it seems like a possible
8297100	8299100	miscommunication that could be cleared up,
8299100	8301100	but Trisha takes anything like that as a bad faith
8301100	8303100	personal attack, and although I could understand
8303100	8305100	why they would feel a bit taken out of context,
8305100	8307100	this isn't a gossip forum, you're appealing to
8307100	8309100	fans of the show, and if you want the audience to not
8309100	8311100	view you through that cynical lens, then you have to
8311100	8313100	at least lend some charity, especially with what
8313100	8315100	you've said, but it's Trisha's choice,
8315100	8317100	and after this point in particular, they're clearly
8317100	8319100	driven to view Ethan as a liar and a manipulator.
8323100	8325100	Trisha, you already did.
8343100	8349100	Now, once again, here is where
8349100	8351100	the uncharitable perspectives really go
8351100	8353100	into gear. Trisha says if Ethan had a problem,
8353100	8355100	then he should have ended the podcast, this may
8355100	8357100	be a valid point, but you could also argue that
8357100	8359100	he wasn't sure of the best way to de-escalate,
8359100	8361100	and there's no guarantee that Trisha would have responded
8361100	8363100	better to him ending the podcast early,
8363100	8365100	regardless, it could have been a mistake on his part.
8365100	8367100	However, Trisha interprets this as him wanting
8367100	8369100	to get a rise out of them, and to have that
8369100	8371100	dramatic walkout moment. Trisha believes
8371100	8373100	that Ethan is weaponising their previous meltdowns
8373100	8375100	by trying to use them to illustrate
8375100	8377100	a double standard. As Trisha's perception of Ethan
8377100	8379100	changes, their perception of the whole instant
8379100	8381100	changes. Everything is now a manipulative
8381100	8383100	tactic on Ethan's part.
8383100	8385100	Ultimately, I have to create a safe work environment for my employees.
8385100	8387100	So don't err. Why?
8387100	8389100	Why? Oh my god.
8389100	8391100	This is, it's so, but again, I don't care,
8391100	8393100	people call me crazy, I'm used to it, call me crazy,
8393100	8395100	it's so manipulative, like, I have to
8395100	8397100	create a safe workplace for my employees, it's like,
8397100	8399100	you're using this thing, like, I, you know what I mean,
8399100	8401100	I mean, you're using these employees,
8401100	8403100	I had, you said I disrespected them,
8403100	8405100	that was the extent of the issue, like...
8405100	8407100	I think the problem is that when Trisha
8407100	8409100	vents, it's Trisha, it's what you expect,
8409100	8411100	and yet when Ethan vents, it suddenly becomes a personal
8411100	8413100	attack to them. I think there are some things that
8413100	8415100	Ethan could have been clear about, maybe you could even
8415100	8417100	say that as a large public creator, he shouldn't have
8417100	8419100	said it, but it's not like I watched Ethan's
8419100	8421100	video and didn't understand where he was coming
8421100	8423100	from a human perspective. When you lose
8423100	8425100	patience with someone, you might say these things
8425100	8427100	publicly, and it's not like they come from an invalid
8427100	8429100	place.
8429100	8431100	...a piece of garbage that, like, I swear
8431100	8433100	on my life, like, before this started, I was like, damn,
8433100	8435100	I lost a really good friend, but you are such
8435100	8437100	a liar, it's so fucked up
8437100	8439100	to lie on that, that I, show
8439100	8441100	me, like, show me a text where I'm like,
8441100	8443100	fire the crew, a conversation, like, that's
8443100	8445100	so fucked and twisted,
8445100	8447100	just because I've had issues with them, just
8447100	8449100	because I've said, like, I don't vibe with them, I don't like their sense
8449100	8451100	of humor, I've never said fire
8451100	8453100	people, are you fucking kidding me right now?
8453100	8455100	Trisha has this concept of
8455100	8457100	if you're not with them, you're against them.
8457100	8459100	It's like a basic survival instinct, and they
8459100	8461100	can't control themselves when responding to these
8461100	8463100	videos, so any point of validity they may
8463100	8465100	have, and I will try and make a case of them later,
8465100	8467100	is lost amongst the anger that someone
8467100	8469100	would ever say these things to you in the first place.
8469100	8471100	I really...
8471100	8473100	I really tried my
8473100	8475100	best, like, obviously we have banter
8475100	8477100	on the show, but, like, I really don't feel like
8477100	8479100	I've been disrespectful,
8479100	8481100	like, the idea of shooting that segment down,
8481100	8483100	like, that was the disrespectful thing, like, yes, it
8483100	8485100	was rude, I'm sorry about it, but, like,
8485100	8487100	damn, like, the whole crew,
8487100	8489100	you're making up lies, and I want them to be
8489100	8491100	fired over that instance, and taking
8491100	8493100	this thing that everyone's pissed at me about, and snowballing it,
8493100	8495100	and creating this monster thing, and bringing this back up
8495100	8497100	in my face, like,
8497100	8499100	then why forgive me in the first place?
8499100	8501100	Like, don't forgive me, like, just end it
8501100	8503100	there. Trisha claims that they're in a pretty good
8503100	8505100	place mentally, and they may well be comparatively,
8505100	8507100	but they're not adjusted enough to the YouTube
8507100	8509100	environment, and these videos are just proof
8509100	8511100	of that. It sucks, because once again, I do believe
8511100	8513100	I can make sense of Trisha's qualms,
8513100	8515100	but these videos did not help.
8515100	8517100	I feel like both Trisha and Ethan felt betrayed
8517100	8519100	by each other, how Ethan views Trisha's nature
8519100	8521100	to take everything public, and impose on reasonable
8521100	8523100	standards, and how Trisha views Ethan's
8523100	8525100	prejudice towards the situation, and how they
8525100	8527100	feel they're trying to mislead their audience.
8527100	8529100	Once betrayal becomes that central focus,
8529100	8531100	these perspectives are only going to diverge
8531100	8533100	further, which is exactly
8533100	8535100	what happened next.
8541100	8545100	...
8545100	8547100	...
8547100	8549100	...
8549100	8551100	...
8551100	8553100	...
8553100	8555100	...
8555100	8557100	...
8557100	8559100	...
8559100	8561100	...
8561100	8563100	...
8563100	8565100	...
8565100	8567100	...
8567100	8569100	...
8569100	8571100	Trisha's videos aren't particularly helpful.
8571100	8573100	I think the problem with this sort of content
8573100	8575100	is that it focuses on a person's reaction
8575100	8577100	in the moment, which when you're dealing with a
8577100	8579100	dispute, is obviously going to be more heated
8579100	8581100	than if you would give them time to see the bigger
8581100	8583100	picture. However, one thing that you could at least
8583100	8585100	say is that they were reactions, and therefore
8585100	8587100	they should be taken with a pinch of salt,
8587100	8589100	even if someone felt the drama was being played
8589100	8591100	up by Trisha. They may have been overreactions,
8591100	8593100	but they were reactions all the same.
8593100	8595100	However, Trisha clearly felt like
8595100	8597100	they hadn't quite made their point.
8597100	8599100	After a couple days of what some may have
8599100	8601100	hoped to be a return to regular content
8601100	8603100	for them, Trisha once more uploaded another
8603100	8605100	video. This time, though, it wasn't a reaction
8605100	8607100	or a response. In fact, its title
8607100	8609100	appeared to imply something much more serious,
8609100	8611100	with a trigger warning clearly expressed in the
8611100	8613100	title. What is the video about itself?
8613100	8615100	I put up
8615100	8617100	with Ethan purposely
8617100	8619100	trying to trigger me
8619100	8621100	on multiple occasions.
8621100	8623100	I always put up with the triggers,
8623100	8625100	and I allowed myself to be triggered
8625100	8627100	um,
8627100	8629100	and this is beyond, this is not
8629100	8631100	walking on eggshells. It's like, oh, I say one wrong
8631100	8633100	thing. No, no, no. This is times where I'm like,
8633100	8635100	don't share the private messages from episode one
8635100	8637100	where he shared messages I sent to him,
8637100	8639100	where he shared Moses' private
8639100	8641100	messages, and we ask him on the show
8641100	8643100	not to. Well, as it's a Trisha
8643100	8645100	video, there are a fair few clashing narratives.
8645100	8647100	However, the one I'd say is probably
8647100	8649100	the most prominent here is that Trisha believes they
8649100	8651100	were much more lenient than Ethan gave them
8651100	8653100	credit for, despite the fact that they believe Ethan
8653100	8655100	attempted to rattle them up on multiple occasions.
8655100	8657100	They believe their hand was forced by Ethan's
8657100	8659100	persistent provocation, listing a few examples.
8659100	8661100	A fair few of these seem to be rather
8661100	8663100	insignificant, but the main incident seems
8663100	8665100	to resolve around a trip that Ethan, Hila, Trisha,
8665100	8667100	and their family took to Disney. This was
8667100	8669100	recorded and uploaded in vlog form to
8669100	8671100	the H3 Podcast channel, and it was
8671100	8673100	pretty well received at the time. However, Trisha
8673100	8675100	seems rather perturbed by a comment Ethan made
8675100	8677100	during this trip about an incident they had also
8677100	8679100	briefly spoken about on the podcast.
8679100	8681100	I want to talk about it. The first things that come to
8681100	8683100	mind obviously are talking to my mom
8683100	8685100	about my sexual assault on
8685100	8687100	a trip from Disneyland, a trip
8687100	8689100	that my mom, sister, and Moses had planned for my birthday
8689100	8691100	and then we did invite
8691100	8693100	Ethan and Hila to come
8693100	8695100	willingly and graciously because I
8695100	8697100	I enjoyed
8697100	8699100	spending time with them there, you know.
8699100	8701100	Okay, let me at least explain myself.
8701100	8703100	No! Let me at least explain
8703100	8705100	myself. Okay.
8705100	8707100	We're on the party bus, and
8707100	8709100	I, we all got our own pizzas.
8709100	8711100	I had my, you know, I love the
8711100	8713100	pineapple, uh,
8713100	8715100	black olive, uh, nobody
8715100	8717100	else wanted it, so I started picking the cheese
8717100	8719100	off. Okay? And I was
8719100	8721100	just eating the toppings, and the pizza looked like
8721100	8723100	a burn victim, it was all disgusting.
8723100	8725100	So anyway, you looked at it and you're like, that is so
8725100	8727100	disgusting, I can't look at it, like that's just the
8727100	8729100	grossest thing I've ever seen. Yeah, it was really gross, I
8729100	8731100	physically had to lay down after it. And I said,
8731100	8733100	I said, Trisha, who are
8733100	8735100	you to talk about gross
8735100	8737100	things? You've shoved a candlestick
8737100	8739100	up your ass. Uh-huh. But the reason
8739100	8741100	I said it is because they
8741100	8743100	literally know everything
8743100	8745100	about this show. Why would I? Which
8745100	8747100	means that I know that they
8747100	8749100	know the meme. It's not something they want to talk about
8749100	8751100	or you want to bring up in front of your family. Okay, fine, fine, fine,
8751100	8753100	but like, well, they were looking
8753100	8755100	at me like, ugh,
8755100	8757100	okay, maybe I fucked up.
8757100	8759100	Alongside the other
8759100	8761100	examples, it feels like Trisha is having one
8761100	8763100	of their revelations in rationalizing
8763100	8765100	their own behavior, crafting this narrative
8765100	8767100	that their reaction was actually the result of continuous
8767100	8769100	comments and incidents that they failed to
8769100	8771100	address themselves, and therefore let boil over
8771100	8773100	in the eventual meltdown that occurred in that
8773100	8775100	fateful episode. However, one really has to
8775100	8777100	question what motivated them to use such a
8777100	8779100	provocative title, when the topic, although
8779100	8781100	somewhat sensitive, isn't exactly communicated
8781100	8783100	with the same sense of pertinence to the actual
8783100	8785100	subject being discussed. I'm not trying to say a
8785100	8787100	trigger warning was unnecessary, or that it makes
8787100	8789100	any discourse of it less valid, but in the
8789100	8791100	established canon of Trisha's upload history on
8791100	8793100	Frenemies, the video advertises itself as much
8793100	8795100	more serious than other content that they have produced
8795100	8797100	on this specific matter, despite the fact that this
8797100	8799100	was once more an analysis of the often fractured
8799100	8801100	dynamic between the two. However, it is
8801100	8803100	a bit more accusatory given that Trisha alleges
8803100	8805100	that Ethan's provocation of them was intentional.
8805100	8807100	Like, all of that was like
8807100	8809100	triggers, right? When I asked to the very last
8809100	8811100	episode, like, we need to stop, we need
8811100	8813100	to stop, and he's like, yes, you can go up and leave
8813100	8815100	whenever you want, you know what I mean? Like, up until
8815100	8817100	even that point, he wanted me to do that thing, and
8817100	8819100	I'm like, I just want to end this. This represents
8819100	8821100	this increasingly cynical perspective
8821100	8823100	that each party held of each other, and in his
8823100	8825100	response, Ethan followed suit. Now,
8825100	8827100	given his relevance to the situation, it's
8827100	8829100	no surprise that Ethan wasn't too flattered
8829100	8831100	by how the video was publicised.
8831100	8833100	However, he decided to go one step further, stating
8833100	8835100	that Trisha's video on the matter goes as
8835100	8837100	far to accuse him of sexual harassment,
8837100	8839100	specifically referring to the comments
8839100	8841100	that Trisha made about his commentary on their new
8841100	8843100	skin product.
8843100	8845100	And then up until, like, the last
8845100	8847100	episode, like, everyone was like, it's clear Trisha
8847100	8849100	was in a bad mood, but
8849100	8851100	it was a lot of things from sexualising
8851100	8853100	my skincare product, like, you know, I was just like
8853100	8855100	that, I was like, you know,
8855100	8857100	because it's not just my line.
8857100	8859100	I would stop short of saying that Trish was trying to
8859100	8861100	accuse him of sexual harassment, but I also don't
8861100	8863100	really understand why Ethan's observation
8863100	8865100	had to be construed as sexual, as they
8865100	8867100	say in the episode, it's childish humour,
8867100	8869100	seeing something perhaps rude in an otherwise
8869100	8871100	unassuming scene.
8871100	8873100	This is the secret, I'm so happy to finally
8873100	8875100	Also kind of phallic. What?
8875100	8877100	You say, Trish, what's the secret? And then you show
8877100	8879100	It looks like a cock, balls
8879100	8881100	and cock. What are you talking about?
8881100	8883100	Look, two balls and a cock, it's like
8883100	8885100	a giant phallic. Oh my god, it's the
8885100	8887100	products in the thing. Bro, it's literally
8887100	8889100	a penis.
8889100	8891100	You are so, so
8891100	8893100	annihilated. With that in mind, I can
8893100	8895100	understand why Ethan feels like he's being misrepresented.
8895100	8897100	How the draw towards a discussion
8897100	8899100	surrounding the semantics of sexual harassment
8899100	8901100	feels a bit sudden, and Trisha once
8901100	8903100	more jumps on that to quickly defend themselves
8903100	8905100	and say they weren't accusing anyone of such
8905100	8907100	a claim. Harking on Ethan's previous comments
8907100	8909100	about them wanting to fire the crew suggests
8909100	8911100	that he has a bit of a habit of strawmanning
8911100	8913100	Trisha's comments. At this point, Trisha
8913100	8915100	and Ethan couldn't even agree on what each other
8915100	8917100	were saying, but some felt like Trisha blurred the
8917100	8919100	line in their comments with the intent of taking advantage
8919100	8921100	of Ethan's defensive response, while critics
8921100	8923100	of Ethan thought he was trying to stir up emotion against
8923100	8925100	Trisha by making their claim seem stronger than
8925100	8927100	they were. Ethan
8927100	8929100	incidentally invited
8929100	8931100	himself to
8931100	8933100	our family's surprise.
8933100	8935100	And
8935100	8937100	we paid
8937100	8939100	for him. Ethan and Hila did not
8939100	8941100	pay for their VIP ticket to Disneyland.
8941100	8943100	We ended up
8943100	8945100	paying for Ethan and Hila,
8945100	8947100	which is crazy
8947100	8949100	because he takes that 5%
8949100	8951100	and VIP tickets
8951100	8953100	to Disneyland is not cheap.
8953100	8955100	And I don't know why he felt compelled
8955100	8957100	to ask me
8957100	8959100	and my mom or bring it up
8959100	8961100	in the situation that
8961100	8963100	how we felt about her
8963100	8965100	having a candlestick
8965100	8967100	up her you know what
8967100	8969100	it made us very uncomfortable, especially
8969100	8971100	we had just such a fun day
8971100	8973100	and
8973100	8975100	it was really disgusting.
8975100	8977100	I think that he wanted
8977100	8979100	the shock value, but I think that
8979100	8981100	he forgets that we're
8981100	8983100	family at the end of the day
8983100	8985100	and I was not appreciative
8985100	8987100	of that. The next few days though
8987100	8989100	were just pure chaos. Trisha's sister
8989100	8991100	decided to weigh in, supporting Trisha's statement
8991100	8993100	and alleging that Ethan and Hila invited
8993100	8995100	themselves to Disney and had their tickets paid
8995100	8997100	for. Ethan then responds to this sister
8997100	8999100	Carly on the After Dark podcast,
8999100	9001100	trying to take a more jocular outlook on the whole
9001100	9003100	situation, but still visibly irritated.
9003100	9005100	And to be honest with you guys,
9005100	9007100	I'm just trying to make the best
9007100	9009100	of this situation that is quite
9009100	9011100	sour to be frank.
9011100	9013100	And so, I watched this
9013100	9015100	with peace and love. So she's
9015100	9017100	first of all saying we invited ourselves
9017100	9019100	for a surprise party.
9019100	9021100	This is where
9021100	9023100	it's just so frustrating for me.
9023100	9025100	You know, we obviously
9025100	9027100	didn't invite ourselves.
9027100	9029100	We were invited,
9029100	9031100	as Trisha even says in her
9031100	9033100	video. It's like they can't even keep their stories
9033100	9035100	straight. Trisha then responds to H3
9035100	9037100	calling them out for this and saying that the sister
9037100	9039100	isn't involved, but also being sufficiently
9039100	9041100	passive aggressive to boot, and it just felt like
9041100	9043100	this endless cycle of people trying to have the
9043100	9045100	final word. When everyone wants the final word,
9045100	9047100	no one's gonna have it.
9047100	9049100	Ethan has this thing where he punched down on people, right?
9049100	9051100	Like, he obviously knows he has a really loyal
9051100	9053100	fanbase, and they're a really loud fanbase.
9053100	9055100	I'm obviously the one getting all the hate. They see
9055100	9057100	that. So for them to do this video like defending themselves
9057100	9059100	when I'm the one getting all the hate, it's like
9059100	9061100	it's really just punching down. It's just punching, punching,
9061100	9063100	punching when it's low. My sister deleted that TikTok
9063100	9065100	within an hour. Trisha's newest video
9065100	9067100	had further sought to justify their own perspective by
9067100	9069100	making Ethan look more unreasonable than he
9069100	9071100	believed himself to be. Allegations that
9071100	9073100	although he tried to laugh at, he clearly construed
9073100	9075100	as very serious, and similarly hit back
9075100	9077100	at Trisha, and as they took to social media
9077100	9079100	to relentlessly attack each other, it began to
9079100	9081100	feel like there may be no way back.
9081100	9083100	However, if one fact is indisputable,
9083100	9085100	Trisha is consistently
9085100	9087100	inconsistent, and although that would
9087100	9089100	once again change their tone,
9089100	9091100	this time, it didn't quite
9091100	9093100	heal the wound.
9095100	9097100	With each of Trisha's videos,
9097100	9099100	it felt strange, because in spite of the fact that they were
9099100	9101100	clearly unhappy with Ethan Klein, there also
9101100	9103100	appeared to be this expectation that by the
9103100	9105100	next Tuesday, they'd be back at the studio,
9105100	9107100	and this would all be water under the bridge.
9107100	9109100	Trisha even eludes to this themself in a tweet,
9109100	9111100	one which Ethan very quickly rebuked.
9111100	9113100	I'm not a subscriber to the school of philosophy
9113100	9115100	that believed Trisha was only upset about the money,
9115100	9117100	and it's not that I don't think there were no legitimate
9117100	9119100	qualms, but it felt like Trisha's videos
9119100	9121100	from a certain point were designed to elicit a
9121100	9123100	reaction from Ethan, and I don't think they did
9123100	9125100	because they loathed Ethan or they wanted to hurt
9125100	9127100	him. I think it's because they almost wanted to play
9127100	9129100	out the situation so that there could be some
9129100	9131100	degree of mutual responsibility spread
9131100	9133100	to the point where they would be inclined to
9133100	9135100	patch it up on the podcast.
9135100	9137100	Although leaving with the usual fireworks, it's
9137100	9139100	clear that Trisha still had a part of them tied
9139100	9141100	to the podcast, even at one point starting
9141100	9143100	their own show called Enemies, which as you can
9143100	9145100	assume was Frenemies without Ethan,
9145100	9147100	something they referred to a few times.
9147100	9149100	So, yeah, this is the podcast
9149100	9151100	Enemies, so I just
9151100	9153100	make enemies, because
9153100	9155100	that's just what I do, and I guess
9155100	9157100	I own up to it.
9157600	9159600	I actually don't want enemies. I will speak the
9159600	9161600	same truth I spoke on Frenemies, but people
9161600	9163600	don't care if there's not a man next to me.
9163600	9165600	And that's just the world we live in.
9165600	9167600	I'm not trying to be over here like a feminist, whatever.
9167600	9169600	I'm fine with that. I'm happy to leech on to
9169600	9171600	another dude for my next
9171600	9173600	venture. That's just how it has to
9173600	9175600	be if my voice is going to be heard.
9175600	9177600	I have an apology to
9177600	9179600	Ethan and the staff
9179600	9181600	coming out this week.
9181600	9183600	Ethan.
9183600	9185600	Go watch
9185600	9187600	Frenemies. I support
9187600	9189600	him having a new co-host
9189600	9191600	or co-hosts if he has multiple.
9191600	9193600	We had ad reads for the whole year, so
9193600	9195600	you know, get that bag, get that coin.
9195600	9197600	In the past, this sort of outburst
9197600	9199600	had motivated Ethan to bring on Dr. Drew,
9199600	9201600	discuss their differences, and find some
9201600	9203600	sort of compromise on how to move forward,
9203600	9205600	something that once again Trisha references
9205600	9207600	in one of their response videos. However, this time
9207600	9209600	Ethan didn't really change his tune, and wasn't
9209600	9211600	interested in resolving any differences between
9211600	9213600	himself and Trisha with their relationship in the
9213600	9215600	state that it was. In less than 24 hours
9215600	9217600	after the launch of Trisha's new podcast, where
9217600	9219600	they take multiple jabs at Ethan, there is
9219600	9221600	once more a change of message.
9243600	9269600	Yes. In this video
9269600	9271600	called Apology to Ethan, Trisha reveals
9271600	9273600	that they've been taking better care of
9273600	9275600	themselves, and have come to the conclusion that they
9275600	9277600	actually have some apologising to do.
9277600	9279600	Fantastic.
9301600	9319600	After a rather meandering menaces
9319600	9321600	of their mental health, they speak about how
9321600	9323600	much they have messed up. They don't really speak about
9323600	9325600	too many of the issues in depth, but they try
9325600	9327600	to elaborate on their mindset, and how this
9327600	9329600	impacted their behaviour towards the clients,
9329600	9331600	and how they felt responsible for sabotaging
9331600	9333600	the podcast because of their feelings. Of the
9333600	9335600	incidents in question, they do apologise for the
9335600	9337600	distasteful jokes they made in the DMs that they
9337600	9339600	leaked. They also apologise for not going to Ethan
9339600	9341600	privately, and just generally their demeanour in
9341600	9343600	how it impacted those around them. Frame those
9343600	9345600	actions as ones yielded from an unhealthy
9345600	9347600	mindset.
9359600	9361600	I see exactly
9361600	9363600	how it came
9363600	9365600	across, and I see it very clearly
9365600	9367600	and I'm so embarrassed
9367600	9369600	because, again, I'm
9369600	9371600	a mess. I'm a messy person. I'm drama.
9371600	9373600	I have issues, as everyone
9373600	9375600	does, but I've always prided myself
9375600	9377600	on being a nice person.
9377600	9379600	I apologise for bringing up money. I apologise
9379600	9381600	for just really, again, poor
9381600	9383600	communication. I feel like I've worked on communication
9383600	9385600	so much in my relationship that I've neglected
9385600	9387600	to work on communication on
9387600	9389600	other ways, like speaking up when
9389600	9391600	even little things, speaking up if I don't like
9391600	9393600	something or don't think, you know, I'm such a hype person
9393600	9395600	I like to, like, hype everything. I love it,
9395600	9397600	love it, love it, and then, like, it got me in trouble
9397600	9399600	with Nikocado and I was like, yes, let's hang out
9399600	9401600	and then I hype, hype, hype, and then ghost because
9401600	9403600	I love to hype. I don't ever
9403600	9405600	like to shoot down ideas. I don't, you know what I mean, but
9405600	9407600	I really need to
9407600	9409600	be better at communicating when I don't
9409600	9411600	like something. I don't want to do something and just be
9411600	9413600	better at it and just grow a pair
9413600	9415600	of balls and talk about it.
9415600	9417600	I'm really sorry. I really am.
9417600	9419600	It's, it's now
9419600	9421600	the stages of
9421600	9423600	a Trish freak out and
9427600	9429600	like, I feel
9429600	9431600	good, I feel strong, I feel like
9431600	9433600	loved and cared
9433600	9435600	for over here. Even the
9435600	9437600	crew and Hila, that
9437600	9439600	I'm sorry
9439600	9441600	and I hope
9441600	9443600	in time that we
9443600	9445600	will be able to
9445600	9447600	talk again. Like,
9447600	9449600	I know once Trish is broken, like,
9449600	9451600	it's nearly impossible
9453600	9455600	to gain back, but
9455600	9457600	I'm willing
9457600	9459600	to put an effort.
9459600	9461600	I don't think it's necessarily the wrong way to
9461600	9463600	go about it. It's important that you make people understand
9463600	9465600	where you're coming from, and how a mindset may have
9465600	9467600	caused you to act out in a particular way,
9467600	9469600	and some appear to praise him for this. However,
9469600	9471600	some also question whether this should have been done privately
9471600	9473600	first, and not too long after, Ethan
9473600	9475600	Klein replied, echoing other people's issues
9475600	9477600	and emphasising the damage he believed they had caused
9477600	9479600	with their prior content.
9479600	9481600	She said in her video,
9481600	9483600	I'm gonna make this apology, and
9483600	9485600	Ethan doesn't have to accept it.
9485600	9487600	It's not
9487600	9489600	that I don't accept her apology,
9489600	9491600	it's that I just,
9491600	9493600	I don't wanna gloss over
9493600	9495600	too much what went down.
9495600	9497600	I mean,
9497600	9499600	it's a lot for me to forgive this
9499600	9501600	fast. Now, I think a public apology for a
9501600	9503600	public issue is always useful, because viewers
9503600	9505600	know where you stand, but Trisha had reached a stage
9505600	9507600	where so much of themselves was online that
9507600	9509600	each public video felt performative,
9509600	9511600	and therefore Ethan was going to be suspicious of
9511600	9513600	this sudden about turn, even for Trisha.
9513600	9515600	I think the problem, and this
9515600	9517600	once again ties back to Dr. Drew, with the previous
9517600	9519600	onset of disputes, it became an established
9519600	9521600	solution to almost use other things as a
9521600	9523600	medium to channel frustrations that they weren't
9523600	9525600	prepared to express. Let things escalate, and
9525600	9527600	then rely on the other party's recognition of that matter.
9527600	9529600	I don't doubt that Trisha likely had qualms with the
9529600	9531600	process of the podcast, and didn't know how to express
9531600	9533600	them at first, or lashed out unnecessarily.
9533600	9535600	However, with the context of the subsequent videos
9535600	9537600	and the apology, the initial departure didn't
9537600	9539600	actually feel like a genuine expression of intent.
9539600	9541600	It felt like a way to once again make a statement
9541600	9543600	on a problem that they perceived. In many of
9543600	9545600	these videos, Trisha would emphasise how their
9545600	9547600	sound of mind now, either due to therapy,
9547600	9549600	or changes to their lifestyle, as a way to
9549600	9551600	justify how this was them now speaking
9551600	9553600	with clarity. It was a way to
9553600	9555600	frame their past behaviour as impulsive,
9555600	9557600	not the real them, but with this, it was
9557600	9559600	difficult to know when we were ever receiving
9559600	9561600	the real Trisha. It felt like Trisha was trying
9561600	9563600	different techniques for the same result, trying
9563600	9565600	to present each one as their real
9565600	9567600	findings, and then gauging reaction.
9567600	9569600	Despite my criticisms though, I will say
9569600	9571600	one thing. It showed that regardless of the defensive
9571600	9573600	fronts, that Trisha still clearly
9573600	9575600	cared about their friendship with Ethan. Really,
9575600	9577600	all these methods screamed to me that this was
9577600	9579600	someone who wanted something, but didn't know how
9579600	9581600	to get it. Unfortunately, because of previous
9581600	9583600	instances, it seemed that the easiest route was
9583600	9585600	to be somewhat hostile. This time, however,
9585600	9587600	Ethan drew a line, and in spite of what may have
9587600	9589600	been an apology, Ethan couldn't accept
9589600	9591600	it. He acknowledged, and even
9591600	9593600	appreciated it, but he stopped short of accepting
9593600	9595600	it. The apology may have
9595600	9597600	come from a genuine place, who knows,
9597600	9599600	but it couldn't overshadow the fact that it
9599600	9601600	followed two weeks of continuous public
9601600	9603600	mudsling. It felt like Trisha was looking
9603600	9605600	for the ends, but didn't understand
9605600	9607600	the means. If this was 20 days earlier,
9607600	9609600	then maybe it would have started rebuilding
9609600	9611600	that bridge, but at this point, the ravine
9611600	9613600	between the two was just far too wide.
9613600	9615600	How was Ethan to know that this wasn't just
9615600	9617600	another vehicle in an attempt to
9617600	9619600	relaunch Frenemies? There were lots of
9619600	9621600	points that could have marked the firm end of Frenemies,
9621600	9623600	but I think Ethan's tepid response to
9623600	9625600	Trisha's apology indicated the return
9625600	9627600	of the podcast was beyond hope.
9627600	9629600	I think Ethan had come to terms with this end
9629600	9631600	not too long after Trisha had announced they were
9631600	9633600	stepping down, and this was his ultimatum
9633600	9635600	to Trisha to accept it as well.
9635600	9637600	How would they move forward from this?
9637600	9639600	Well, sometimes Frenemy ships
9639600	9641600	aren't built to last.
9649600	9651600	Ethan addressed Trisha's apology one more time
9651600	9653600	in a segment on Off The Rails. In this, he echoed
9653600	9655600	many of the sentiments that he had expressed on Twitter
9655600	9657600	in a much more discernible tone of frustrated
9657600	9659600	exasperation, asserting that although
9659600	9661600	he wasn't opposed to an eventual reconciliation,
9661600	9663600	he wasn't prepared to forgive so quickly
9663600	9665600	and needed time. He also wasn't prepared
9665600	9667600	to let someone like Trisha close again,
9667600	9669600	when that in mind was not interested in reviving
9669600	9671600	the podcast, yet this was far
9671600	9673600	from the end.
9697600	9699600	Trisha was saying everything she could
9699600	9701600	to attack me personally, to attack
9701600	9703600	the business. If this is an apology
9703600	9705600	to me, why do I have to watch it on her
9705600	9707600	YouTube channel with 10 mid-rolls?
9707600	9709600	A phone call would have been nice. She has my
9709600	9711600	number, she knows that I'm open to talk
9711600	9713600	anytime, she missed, you know what I mean?
9713600	9715600	And she apologized to the crew, she said
9715600	9717600	previously she doesn't have any of the crew's contact
9717600	9719600	information, I'm sorry, but that's not true.
9719600	9721600	We're all in a group chat on WhatsApp,
9721600	9723600	she has everybody's phone number.
9723600	9725600	Around a week and a half after, Trisha uploaded a video
9725600	9727600	claiming there was an unaired episode of
9727600	9729600	Friendemies which featured a greater reconciliation
9729600	9731600	between the two parties, including an
9731600	9733600	apology from Ethan. You may seem to believe
9733600	9735600	this was filmed to promote their post-breakup merchandise
9735600	9737600	release that was being dropped around the same time.
9737600	9739600	However, after the merch sold out nearly
9739600	9741600	instantaneously, the motive to upload the
9741600	9743600	video was assumedly diminished.
9743600	9745600	After Trisha's video covering this, many podcast
9745600	9747600	fans requested that Ethan not upload
9747600	9749600	the video as they didn't want the drama prolonged,
9749600	9751600	and the episode, whatever its contents,
9751600	9753600	was never released. Following this,
9753600	9755600	there was a moment of respite, as it seemed
9755600	9757600	that both had just grown apart, and even
9757600	9759600	if reconciliation wasn't possible, the
9759600	9761600	absence of conflict was a welcome break for most
9761600	9763600	viewers. However, it always felt like a ceasefire
9763600	9765600	as opposed to a peace treaty, mainly
9765600	9767600	due to this suggested rapprochement on
9767600	9769600	Trisha's video. It's very hard for me to speculate
9769600	9771600	on what may or may not have been said,
9771600	9773600	because the only source is Trisha, and they do
9773600	9775600	have their biases, but if this video
9775600	9777600	marked some sort of understanding between the
9777600	9779600	two, then it wasn't to be recognized by
9779600	9781600	anyone outside, and in future videos
9781600	9783600	the underlying message was that there was still
9783600	9785600	unresolved tension.
9805600	9807600	For a while this seemed like Trisha's angle,
9807600	9809600	and maybe if this philosophy had sustained itself,
9809600	9811600	an eventual modification would have been
9811600	9813600	reached, but unfortunately this was not
9813600	9815600	the case. As I noted earlier, regardless
9815600	9817600	of what you think of the apology, it felt more
9817600	9819600	like another momentary decision rather than
9819600	9821600	a concrete resolution. For many people,
9821600	9823600	an apology normally marks the end of something,
9823600	9825600	a concession that you'd be foolish
9825600	9827600	to walk back on. At the same time,
9827600	9829600	sometimes as people feel they've been manipulated into
9829600	9831600	making a confession, they may retract it,
9831600	9833600	and as time transpired, Trisha seemed
9833600	9835600	to walk back their narrative once more,
9835600	9837600	slowly returning to their former position,
9837600	9839600	that they really had done nothing wrong, and
9839600	9841600	that responsibility primarily lay with Ethan.
9859600	9861600	It felt like the situation ultimately wasn't resolved,
9861600	9863600	Trisha felt inclined to continuously make these
9863600	9865600	statements to try and keep it alive, while making
9865600	9867600	it look like they weren't necessarily going
9867600	9869600	out of their way to talk about it, coincidentally
9869600	9871600	appearing on these podcasts who just seem
9871600	9873600	to be interested in discussing the latest
9873600	9875600	tea. Throughout all this, Ethan really
9875600	9877600	didn't say much, and whether that influenced
9877600	9879600	Trisha's next move is your judgement to make.
9879600	9881600	What move was that, I hear you ask?
9881600	9883600	Well, as I mentioned
9883600	9885600	a while back, Ethan's often quite
9885600	9887600	vocal with who he despises,
9887600	9889600	and one person who definitely fits that bill is
9889600	9891600	Keemstar, who Ethan has waged war against for
9891600	9893600	a good few years. Trisha in many ways
9893600	9895600	also seemed to be vocally critical
9895600	9897600	of Keemstar, attacking him for a variety
9897600	9899600	of reasons over the years, but if Trisha's
9899600	9901600	relationship with Ethan taught us anything
9901600	9903600	is that Trisha's sentiments can be known to
9903600	9905600	fluctuate a little. At that time, Keemstar
9905600	9907600	had found himself in some controversy due to
9907600	9909600	the age gap in his relationship with a
9909600	9911600	20-year-old female. At the same time, both
9911600	9913600	Ethan and Trisha had separately taken to YouTube
9913600	9915600	to criticise him, Ethan on his After
9915600	9917600	Dark podcast, and Trisha on their third
9917600	9918600	episode of Enemies.
9918600	9920600	And she doesn't know that I played
9920600	9922600	bad guy Keem online. Okay, if you're
9922600	9924600	bad guy Keem online and that's a character you're
9924600	9926600	playing, Daniel Keem, then you're an actual
9926600	9928600	creep in real life, like you are actually
9928600	9930600	a real-life perv, a real-life
9930600	9932600	just creep, just evil, just nasty,
9932600	9934600	just a nasty old man that's like
9934600	9936600	hurting this girl in ways that she may
9936600	9938600	not know, but you know,
9938600	9940600	you know, because I know he knows because
9940600	9942600	he's constantly bringing up things people are gonna
9942600	9944600	say, the power play, the this, but she's not
9944600	9946600	a fan. Trying to rationalise it on
9946600	9948600	this show, on Spotify, on his podcast
9948600	9950600	is like mind-blowing
9951600	9953600	Keemstar played this off with the usual
9953600	9955600	bombast that many expected from him, leaning
9955600	9957600	into the stereotype rather than running away
9957600	9959600	from it, if anything it showed that neither side
9959600	9961600	was willing to yield, yet for some fans it may have
9961600	9963600	been refreshing that Ethan and Trisha finally agreed
9963600	9965600	on something once more, but this moment of blissful
9965600	9967600	harmony was short-lived, as less than a week
9967600	9969600	after this Keemstar tweeted a picture of him
9969600	9971600	with FaZe Banks alongside, lo and behold,
9971600	9973600	Trisha Paytas, all looking
9973600	9975600	rather pleased with themselves, I wonder
9975600	9977600	why. This of course provoked a response
9977600	9979600	from Ethan who expressed disappointment of Trisha's
9979600	9981600	newfound allegiance, Trisha responded
9981600	9983600	over a variety of mediums, but we're gonna skip
9983600	9985600	over those for now. However, what would
9985600	9987600	the podcast actually be about?
9987600	9989600	After all, you can't just judge a book by
9989600	9991600	its cover, and Trish requested that everyone
9991600	9993600	give the episode a chance.
10009600	10015600	In the podcast,
10015600	10017600	Keemstar explains how it reached out to Trisha
10017600	10019600	offering a truce, and Trisha had agreed.
10019600	10021600	Trisha is fast to clarify that they're not
10021600	10023600	necessarily befriending Keemstar, and they're
10023600	10025600	actually still more pro-Ethan than pro-Keem,
10025600	10027600	though they definitely don't hold back in
10027600	10029600	analysing Ethan's behaviour over the previous
10029600	10031600	months.
10039600	10041600	Like, never aired, right?
10041600	10043600	Can I say that publicly?
10043600	10045600	There's an unaired last episode?
10045600	10047600	Yeah, we shot
10047600	10049600	one more for closure, and it was really
10049600	10051600	good, because I do feel
10051600	10053600	like I'd fucked up a lot, but it was the first
10053600	10055600	time Ethan admitted to screenshotting
10055600	10057600	my text, and I was like, oh perfect, this
10057600	10059600	will give me some redeeming qualities, because
10059600	10061600	he admitted in that that I never said fire to the crew, and I was like, perfect,
10061600	10063600	people are gonna know, they're gonna stop hating on me.
10063600	10065600	But then, yeah, he didn't post it, because he's like,
10065600	10067600	well, I don't want more hate to the crew, and it's gonna
10067600	10069600	pass out this person, and I was just like,
10069600	10071600	you posted all my breakdowns, but you're not gonna post this one
10071600	10073600	where I kinda look like, at least we're
10073600	10075600	balanced in being in the wrong, yeah.
10075600	10077600	So I have a little animosity towards him, like, I still
10077600	10079600	obviously love Ethan, but I do
10079600	10081600	have a little bit of that, I get what you're saying.
10081600	10083600	I think being sat down with two people who have a history
10083600	10085600	of conflict with Ethan kind of draws Trisha into this
10085600	10087600	discussion about him more than they probably
10087600	10089600	plan to be. The conversation isn't just about
10089600	10091600	Ethan, but it regularly returns to him.
10091600	10093600	Keemstar driving home the point that in his opinion,
10093600	10095600	Ethan is a moral weatherbane, and
10095600	10097600	sends the popular opinions to garner a social
10097600	10099600	advantage, while receiving special treatment
10099600	10101600	from YouTube. Trisha often plays off this
10101600	10103600	narrative with their own personal experiences,
10103600	10105600	talking about many of the previous incidents that still
10105600	10107600	seem unresolved to them.
10107600	10109600	He's a walking, talking hypocrite.
10109600	10111600	Oh, for sure, I don't think there's anything wrong with that,
10111600	10113600	because I'm also a walking, talking hypocrite.
10113600	10115600	I think, again, it's just the lack of, like, admitting
10115600	10117600	that, like, I feel like if you could admit it,
10117600	10119600	because I, 100%, like, even me sitting here,
10119600	10121600	people are like, she's so hypocritical, whatever, you know what I mean?
10121600	10123600	But I don't think it is that either, I honestly think
10123600	10125600	it's just, like, having a discussion, but...
10153600	10155600	I mean, I think it's, like, gross when people do make fun
10155600	10157600	of people's, like, looks, or small penises, or whatever.
10157600	10159600	I don't like when people make fun
10159600	10161600	of people's, like, aesthetic, but I'm telling you
10161600	10163600	that's how me and Ethan first met, he made a whole video
10163600	10165600	calling me, like, a whale, like, a corpse,
10165600	10167600	like, all this stuff, saying how, like, I photoshopped my pictures,
10167600	10169600	so, like, he did the same thing to me, so it is
10169600	10171600	a little hypocritical, but I do think it, I mean,
10171600	10173600	that was... It was ironic that this was
10173600	10175600	approximately a year after Keem had offered a truce
10175600	10177600	to Ethan, who started framing me shortly after.
10177600	10179600	This time, it was Keem's turn to platform
10179600	10181600	Trisha, though. It seems that Keem had worked
10181600	10183600	out that although Trisha talked to Big Game,
10183600	10185600	they were regularly swayed, and in this case
10185600	10187600	it worked out almost exactly as
10187600	10189600	envisioned, well, for Keem at least.
10189600	10191600	This wasn't out of the ordinary for Trisha,
10191600	10193600	they're known to go on podcasts for people they have
10193600	10195600	grievances with, that's why they appeared on the H3 podcast
10195600	10197600	in the first place. However, given how the
10197600	10199600	discussion does tend to pivot towards
10199600	10201600	Ethan, and given how Ethan doesn't quite
10201600	10203600	share the same philosophy, people weren't
10203600	10205600	entirely happy, and neither
10205600	10207600	was Ethan.
10211600	10213600	In
10213600	10215600	this situation, even the
10215600	10217600	photo of Trisha with Keemstar had provoked
10217600	10219600	a bit of uproar from the Clines, however, there was
10219600	10221600	also a bit more context that makes the
10221600	10223600	circumstances more primed for hostility.
10223600	10225600	The girl is not to blame for
10225600	10227600	anything. The girl is
10227600	10229600	only 20 years old, she's a child,
10229600	10231600	we love, I mean, well, I don't know anything about
10231600	10233600	her, but I'm not going after her at all, I was never gonna
10233600	10235600	criticise her or say anything bad about her,
10235600	10237600	this is just about a 39 year old creep
10237600	10239600	preying on a young girl.
10239600	10241600	In the video covering Keemstar's new girlfriend,
10241600	10243600	Ethan included a segment which
10243600	10245600	entailed an individual calling in and claiming
10245600	10247600	to be this lady, and going into rather explicit
10247600	10249600	detail about the relationship.
10249600	10251600	Keemstar felt that there was a double standard being
10251600	10253600	operated here, and tweeted a video tagging
10253600	10255600	Team YouTube and talking about the situation
10255600	10257600	at hand.
10269600	10271600	The emails here threatening me that that's
10271600	10273600	gonna happen, can't do creator on creator
10273600	10275600	harassment, but Ethan Cline
10275600	10277600	has made about 50 fucking
10277600	10279600	videos breaking
10279600	10281600	TOS, breaking the bullying and harassment
10281600	10283600	thing, he uploaded a fucking
10283600	10285600	video of a Keemstar puppet and he's like
10285600	10287600	fucking it, how is that not
10287600	10289600	breaking YouTube TOS,
10289600	10291600	how is that not breaking the bullying and
10291600	10293600	harassment thing, now he uploads this video
10293600	10295600	with someone that's supposed to be my new girlfriend,
10295600	10297600	it's like a fake person calling
10297600	10299600	in, and they're like, yeah Keem's got a
10299600	10301600	little dick, Keem's dick doesn't
10301600	10303600	work, and am I over here crying
10303600	10305600	about it? Absolutely not.
10305600	10307600	But let me talk shit back.
10307600	10309600	I really wanna fucking know
10309600	10311600	Susan, Team YouTube,
10311600	10313600	everybody at YouTube, why is it
10313600	10315600	Keemstar versus H3H3,
10315600	10317600	I have sent emails
10317600	10319600	when he broke TOS saying, hey look
10319600	10321600	he's doing the same thing that you threatened to kick me
10321600	10323600	out of the partnership program, and it gets
10323600	10325600	ignored. Explain the blatant
10325600	10327600	fucking bias, because all
10327600	10329600	these fucking YouTubers, David Dobrik,
10329600	10331600	everyone else has dealt with this bullshit
10331600	10333600	with Ethan Klein, why is it other
10333600	10335600	YouTubers versus Ethan Klein
10335600	10337600	and YouTube staff, please explain
10337600	10339600	it to all of us right now,
10339600	10341600	why he's getting special privileges.
10341600	10343600	Not too long after this, the H3 After
10343600	10345600	Dark video on the matter was removed for violating
10345600	10347600	YouTube's TOS, with many assuming
10347600	10349600	that Keemstar played a hand in this.
10349600	10351600	Though he denied direct involvement in the removal
10351600	10353600	of the video, it was hard to completely buy
10353600	10355600	this idea that his vocal outcries hadn't
10355600	10357600	influenced YouTube in some sort of way,
10357600	10359600	with many requesting to see his flag history.
10359600	10361600	For someone like Ethan, who already vehemently loathes
10361600	10363600	Keemstar, there was no two ways about
10363600	10365600	it. Keemstar had committed an attack on the podcast,
10365600	10367600	and a form of friends alliance at a time
10367600	10369600	of heightened conflict was a stonewall
10369600	10371600	betrayal. With this in mind, in his first
10371600	10373600	H3 Off the Rails back, Ethan decides
10373600	10375600	to address Trisha Paytas one last
10375600	10376600	time.
10376600	10378600	So basically what this is to me,
10378600	10380600	she is uh,
10380600	10382600	what's the name of that famous turncoat
10382600	10384600	during the revolutionary Benedict
10384600	10386600	Benedict Arnold? Yeah, she Benedict
10386600	10388600	Arnold'd me big time.
10388600	10390600	This is an unforgivable
10390600	10392600	traitorous act. And I'm going to explain
10392600	10394600	in great detail why.
10394600	10396600	And I'm going to be totally honest with you guys,
10396600	10398600	a part of me wanted to take the high road
10398600	10400600	on this and just ignore it.
10400600	10402600	Uh, but at the same time, I'm
10402600	10404600	so sick of her disrespecting
10404600	10406600	me, and my family,
10406600	10408600	and causing shit,
10408600	10410600	and just being so toxic, lying,
10410600	10412600	and I'm just so
10412600	10414600	freaking over her.
10414600	10416600	Now as I've noted, it's not exactly
10416600	10418600	surprising taking a perfunctory look
10418600	10420600	at Trisha's history. They wanted to go on
10420600	10422600	Keem's podcast, though Ethan certainly compiles
10422600	10424600	a fair assembly of clips that make even
10424600	10426600	this decision look a bit inconsistent
10426600	10428600	on Trisha's part, especially given
10428600	10430600	their familial relation, throwing some shade
10430600	10432600	towards Moses as well. Trisha's even
10432600	10434600	gone on podcast with Gabbie Hanna previously,
10434600	10436600	so it's clear that they're not entirely hostile
10436600	10438600	to anyone. But in a way, although it makes
10438600	10440600	sense that Trisha would do this, the question
10440600	10442600	Ethan wants to ask is, should she?
10468600	10470600	Can this story get blown out of proportion?
10470600	10472600	Girl, what?
10498600	10500600	serious, serious help. So don't even think
10500600	10502600	for a second that you're trolling, or ruining, or
10502600	10504600	anyone thinks around it.
10504600	10506600	So she has that much energy
10506600	10508600	for our word apologist,
10508600	10510600	but keep the same energy
10510600	10512600	because, um,
10512600	10514600	Keemstar,
10514600	10516600	on the same exact situation,
10516600	10518600	said way worse things, and if you care
10518600	10520600	about Jessie Smiles, she
10520600	10522600	seemed to have been way more
10522600	10524600	offended by what Keemstar said than
10524600	10526600	Gabbie, of the
10526600	10528600	protecting.
10528600	10530600	You have handled this situation with such poor taste.
10530600	10532600	You're right, you don't know what happened.
10532600	10534600	But you sure felt like you did all these years
10534600	10536600	when you consistently called me a liar,
10536600	10538600	mocked my accusations. Sorry
10538600	10540600	you hate all these r-word cases. By the way,
10540600	10542600	must be hard on you. And she included
10542600	10544600	a screenshot of Keemstar saying, sorry,
10544600	10546600	Jessie Smiles tagged her on
10546600	10548600	Twitter, only has 140
10548600	10550600	characters. Please don't accuse me
10550600	10552600	of r-word. He's making a joke out of it.
10552600	10554600	Basically accusing her of making
10554600	10556600	false allegations.
10556600	10558600	This is just one specific
10558600	10560600	example of Keemstar's
10560600	10562600	continued
10564600	10566600	history of
10566600	10568600	not believing victims.
10568600	10570600	In part, he does respond to the
10570600	10572600	narratives espoused throughout the podcast,
10572600	10574600	but more tries take a holistic standpoint that this
10574600	10576600	is Keemstar taking advantage of Trisha
10576600	10578600	for his own gain, showing a variety of tweets
10578600	10580600	and clips that seem to imply that Keemstar is
10580600	10582600	enjoying the situation much more than anyone
10582600	10584600	else's. Even supposedly inviting
10584600	10586600	Gabbie Hanna on the same day they were hosting
10586600	10588600	Trisha and joking about it with FaZe Banks
10588600	10590600	on the podcast.
10612600	10614600	Jorts on.
10614600	10616600	Legends. Legend.
10616600	10618600	Here, now, again, she's
10618600	10620600	a free speech advocate all the sudden
10620600	10622600	and she believes in
10622600	10624600	talking to anyone about anything, right?
10624600	10626600	So here is, here they, they're kind
10626600	10628600	of teasing her a little bit. They're kind of making a fool
10628600	10630600	out of her. Listen to this.
10630600	10632600	He was here. Imagine- I swear I thought you were gonna do that.
10632600	10634600	No, but listen, listen. Imagine if Gabbie was here
10634600	10636600	and we posted a picture, FaZe Banks
10636600	10638600	Keemstar, Trisha, Gabbie.
10638600	10640600	I'd bolt.
10640600	10642600	She'd bolt.
10642600	10644600	She's there. Gabbie's there.
10644600	10646600	Or at least she's on her way there.
10646600	10648600	So Keemstar starts being like, can you imagine
10648600	10650600	if Gabbie was here?
10650600	10652600	She's testing the water a little bit.
10652600	10654600	I'd bolt.
10654600	10656600	Interesting.
10656600	10658600	I wouldn't do that to you.
10658600	10660600	I wouldn't do that to you.
10660600	10662600	On the whole though, this video is designed to be the final nail
10662600	10664600	in the coffin for Ethan and Trisha's working
10664600	10666600	relationship, and dare I say it, friendship.
10666600	10668600	Even goes on to discuss the unaired
10668600	10670600	episode which Trisha had been bringing up over the last
10670600	10672600	month, and explains that the reason it wasn't released
10672600	10674600	was because he didn't feel like it gave anyone
10674600	10676600	the closure Trisha claims it did, and it was actually
10676600	10678600	quite an uncomfortable recording which he rather
10678600	10680600	regrets. He also notes that Trisha
10680600	10682600	claims to have recorded the episode, and has been
10682600	10684600	alluding to it in the DMs, stating that he is
10684600	10686600	not fazed by the implication that they may release it.
10686600	10688600	How everything had gone
10688600	10690600	down, I was feeling bad about
10690600	10692600	the rift that it had caused
10692600	10694600	in the family and everything, and
10694600	10696600	I wanted to make amends,
10696600	10698600	and in my heart, I thought
10698600	10700600	what would be great is if we could just
10700600	10702600	come together for one final episode
10702600	10704600	for it to be wholesome,
10704600	10706600	for it to be just a beautiful experience
10706600	10708600	where we just reflect on the nice
10708600	10710600	experience we have and part ways
10710600	10712600	amicably. As soon as we sat
10712600	10714600	down, basically almost immediately
10714600	10716600	it just went sideways. It just went
10716600	10718600	off the rails,
10718600	10720600	it just turned into more accusations
10720600	10722600	and it just got really icky.
10722600	10724600	And I was like immediately
10724600	10726600	regretting it, because it was just
10726600	10728600	it was just
10728600	10730600	not at all what I wanted or expected.
10730600	10732600	This whole claim that like
10732600	10734600	I had never apologized to her, she keeps saying like
10734600	10736600	he apologized, I proved
10736600	10738600	that he, that the, that
10738600	10740600	I never said I wanted to fire the crew.
10740600	10742600	Um, you know, I admitted
10742600	10744600	in my first video, about
10744600	10746600	Trisha leaving for enemies, that I
10746600	10748600	messed up in showing the crew the text.
10748600	10750600	They secretly recorded us,
10750600	10752600	which was like
10752600	10754600	kind of devastating to me.
10754600	10756600	That they came into the house,
10756600	10758600	secretly
10758600	10760600	recorded our conversations
10760600	10762600	before and after the podcast
10762600	10764600	and during. The thing is I'm not
10764600	10766600	I don't care if they release it, so it's not like a
10766600	10768600	I think they think, I don't know why they
10768600	10770600	think it's such a big deal, it's just a messy
10770600	10772600	episode. But I
10772600	10774600	guess in their mind they think they've been
10774600	10776600	threatening us with like, well we recorded
10776600	10778600	it, here it is,
10778600	10780600	we're going to release it,
10780600	10782600	you know, I'm listening to it back, it's like
10782600	10784600	I just found that like
10784600	10786600	such a violation
10786600	10788600	to come into our house and secretly
10788600	10790600	record us. I was like, wow.
10790600	10792600	This may not be closure
10792600	10794600	per se, but it is the closest that people
10794600	10796600	were going to have. Two contrasting yet
10796600	10798600	affirmative perspectives. From this, people
10798600	10800600	could draw their own conclusions. However, beyond
10800600	10802600	the basic allegations of hypocrisy, there
10802600	10804600	was a more troubling allegation. Hypocrisy
10804600	10806600	is when you say something in the moment
10806600	10808600	and contradict that at a later time, and
10808600	10810600	although it can be problematic, it's not particularly
10810600	10812600	exceptional, especially in this industry,
10812600	10814600	particularly as you often can't decipher
10814600	10816600	intent. However, Ethan once more chose to
10816600	10818600	go in on Trisha, accusing them of lying over
10818600	10820600	a variety of issues relating to the podcast,
10820600	10822600	including statements they had made since.
10838600	10840600	Uh,
10840600	10842600	yeah.
10862600	10864600	Wait, how many followers
10864600	10866600	does this account have? Oh my god!
10868600	10870600	He also gave some attention to
10870600	10872600	accounts that seem dedicated to showing these rather
10872600	10874600	conscious contradictions, particularly
10874600	10876600	those on TikTok. He seems quite amused by
10876600	10878600	most of these clips, and although you can understand
10878600	10880600	why they would have irked him, often after the collapse
10880600	10882600	of a working relationship, you are prone
10882600	10884600	to trash talk your former colleague a little,
10884600	10886600	so these aren't exactly surprising.
10886600	10888600	However, there is one clip that he seems to take slightly
10888600	10890600	more seriously, relating to an anecdote
10890600	10892600	that Trisha shared while the podcast was still operating
10892600	10894600	fairly smoothly.
10898600	10900600	That actually
10900600	10902600	really disturbed me.
10928600	10930600	I wanted a Pomeranian for a long time.
10930600	10932600	Both me and my mom have wanted a puppy
10932600	10934600	for so long. I live alone.
10934600	10936600	My mom is alone.
10936600	10938600	Yeah, he's adorable.
10938600	10940600	This color is just perfect.
10940600	10942600	Everyone who meets him falls in love with him.
10942600	10944600	They just surprised me with it for our vlog and made me keep it.
10944600	10946600	We're gonna try and get some houses because we honestly want
10946600	10948600	more. We just love this little guy so,
10948600	10950600	so much. We just love him so much,
10950600	10952600	and hopefully that'll show in here.
10952600	10954600	We want two more. We want a little black one,
10954600	10956600	and possibly a white one.
10956600	10958600	I never asked for a dog. Oh my god, let's go get a dog.
10958600	10960600	You wanna go what? You wanna go buy a dog today?
10960600	10962600	I never asked for a dog. Can we get a dog? Oh my god.
10962600	10964600	My dog was because of David and Jason.
10964600	10966600	They just surprised me with it for our vlog and made me...
10966600	10968600	Dude, it's so disturbing
10968600	10970600	to me how she's openly lying.
10970600	10972600	In this clip, Trisha's prior behavior
10972600	10974600	appears to directly refute all available
10974600	10976600	testimony that they articulated
10976600	10978600	off enemies, leaving Ethan rather bemused,
10978600	10980600	and even concerned as to Trisha's capability
10980600	10982600	to expound mistruths.
10982600	10984600	So disturbing to me
10984600	10986600	how she's openly lying.
10986600	10988600	She really convinced me
10988600	10990600	of this dog lie.
10990600	10992600	And she really successfully
10992600	10994600	assassinated their character. Now, I mean
10994600	10996600	this specifically has me questioning
10996600	10998600	everything. And I
10998600	11000600	can't help but wonder if I've just been a
11000600	11002600	useful idiot to her this whole time.
11002600	11004600	And the essay allegation about Dom, like
11004600	11006600	all that stuff that was made publicly separate of her
11006600	11008600	is like, you know, 100%
11008600	11010600	believable. But like this dog thing
11010600	11012600	like, I just feel like I've been the useful
11012600	11014600	idiot to her the whole time to
11014600	11016600	smear these people that she hates, because
11016600	11018600	this is a flat out
11018600	11020600	horrific lie to
11020600	11022600	make about someone.
11022600	11024600	In a way, this was the only significant
11024600	11026600	development on the situation. Trisha's appearance
11026600	11028600	on Mum's basement didn't really change the
11028600	11030600	narratives too much. We knew what each party
11030600	11032600	would probably say. We know where these people
11032600	11034600	stand on each other. How this moment seemed to
11034600	11036600	at least prompt a brief reassessment of the
11036600	11038600	podcast by Ethan, and this reassessment
11038600	11040600	would only yield more questions in the coming
11040600	11042600	month. Trisha has commented on
11042600	11044600	countless issues, and shared many anecdotes
11044600	11046600	in extensive detail, often more detailed
11046600	11048600	than a majority of people would ever be expected
11048600	11050600	to recall. Some of these were related to
11050600	11052600	YouTube dramas like the David de Brix saga,
11052600	11054600	but there were also a lot of personal stories
11054600	11056600	which they opened up about, and as a person with
11056600	11058600	their own trauma, they would share some of these stories
11058600	11060600	to an often very sympathetic audience.
11060600	11062600	One of these stories that was particularly harrowing
11062600	11064600	was about a teacher who had violated them while
11064600	11066600	they were in school, an experience unfortunately
11066600	11068600	a lot more common than we'd like it to be.
11068600	11070600	At the time, it was a very powerful moment
11070600	11072600	on the podcast, and they had a set of people
11072600	11074600	surrounding them who were ready to support them.
11074600	11076600	However, with some questions beginning to
11076600	11078600	arise about Trisha's accuracy in delivering
11078600	11080600	information, a new light was shone
11080600	11082600	onto some of these allegations.
11091600	11094600	September 2021 was a rough month.
11094600	11096600	Trisha's decision to appear on mum's basement
11096600	11098600	had already put a further strain on the family
11098600	11100600	relationship, under burden from numerous
11100600	11102600	incidents, some of which were documented on the H3 podcast.
11122600	11124600	This had continuously manifested
11124600	11126600	with other family members involving themselves,
11126600	11128600	one of them being Moses Ackman,
11128600	11130600	the individual who served as the keystone in the
11130600	11132600	connection between the Klines and Patus.
11132600	11134600	He had recently become more vocal in his
11134600	11136600	participation after certain claims were made about
11136600	11138600	his conduct, defending himself while also
11138600	11140600	criticising Ethan for his behaviour.
11140600	11142600	As both parties stewed in the fallout of the latest
11142600	11144600	strife, questions were being raised about the story
11144600	11146600	that Trisha had told on episode 17,
11146600	11148600	the violation story.
11154600	11172600	One of the details
11172600	11174600	Trisha had divulged during this anecdote was that
11174600	11176600	this teacher was eventually arrested on charges
11176600	11178600	of CP. However, with some digging, certain
11178600	11180600	people began to uncover information that disputed
11180600	11182600	this claim. As a matter of fact, it was discovered
11182600	11184600	that the teacher mentioned had retired from his role,
11184600	11186600	passing on from this world in 2019.
11186600	11188600	Along with other supposed inconsistencies,
11188600	11190600	this was covered in a one and a half hour video
11190600	11192600	uploaded by a creator called mysterious.
11192600	11194600	Then the fourth time
11194600	11196600	she mentions this same story is on
11196600	11198600	TikTok on March 19th
11198600	11200600	2021. This time, Trisha
11200600	11202600	encourages her followers
11202600	11204600	to search the teacher and look up his
11204600	11206600	arrest. So Trisha specifically
11206600	11208600	says that this teacher has been arrested.
11208600	11210600	It seems legit, right? Surely if
11210600	11212600	Trisha is encouraging their audience to
11212600	11214600	look this up, it would pop right up when you
11214600	11216600	search it. That isn't the case at all. In fact,
11216600	11218600	when you Google exactly what Trisha says,
11218600	11220600	this teacher does pop up under the
11220600	11222600	top results, but it isn't because he was
11222600	11224600	arrested. It was because he passed away
11224600	11226600	in 2019 and his obituary
11226600	11228600	pops up when you Google what she
11228600	11230600	says. This observation began to
11230600	11232600	garner traction in forums and comment sections
11232600	11234600	with some calling on Ethan to amend the story
11234600	11236600	with minor information available, and on the
11236600	11238600	11th of September, he released a statement.
11238600	11240600	This echoed much of what the concerned
11240600	11242600	parties at the time were professing, that
11242600	11244600	although it was not necessarily his place to
11244600	11246600	discredit a survivor's story, he also couldn't
11246600	11248600	keep that story up in good faith knowing the
11248600	11250600	elements of it simply weren't true. Now
11250600	11252600	it's completely fair to acknowledge that given how
11252600	11254600	trauma affects memory and recalls certain
11254600	11256600	events, it's possible that Trisha may have confused
11256600	11258600	the details and names related to these
11258600	11260600	accounts. However, with the previous contradictions
11260600	11262600	in mind, it obviously occurred to
11262600	11264600	Ethan that maybe there was the possibility
11264600	11266600	that this version of events had been somewhat
11266600	11268600	fabricated, and in that case, especially
11268600	11270600	when dealing with criminal allegations, it's fair
11270600	11272600	to err on the side of caution. Ethan had
11272600	11274600	also followed up privately with Trisha,
11274600	11276600	seeking clarification of these claims, with many
11276600	11278600	audience members also publicly stating their
11278600	11280600	desire for this to be addressed. How did they
11280600	11282600	respond to this inquiry? Well, Trisha
11282600	11284600	first found a deluge of tweets defending
11284600	11286600	their mimosas from those who they felt were applying
11286600	11288600	pressure, and feeling threatened by
11288600	11290600	Ethan's turn, the DMs decided to share the messages
11290600	11292600	themselves, and let people decide on
11292600	11294600	who was behaving with the most decorum,
11294600	11296600	and honestly, it's a dumpster fire, with
11296600	11298600	everyone throwing blame at each other's feet.
11298600	11300600	Ethan compels Trisha to make a public statement,
11300600	11302600	and Trisha shares many posts that they believe
11302600	11304600	were contributing to unnecessary harassment.
11304600	11306600	Both Trisha and Ethan seem to use this
11306600	11308600	accused individual's family in their narrative,
11308600	11310600	Ethan in his post, and Trisha in the messages.
11310600	11312600	It's hard to know what the family themselves
11312600	11314600	want, but I'm not sure this is it.
11314600	11316600	In the end, they become secondary to
11316600	11318600	further allegations levelled towards Trisha's
11318600	11320600	fiancé, Moses, which had been circulating
11320600	11322600	recently as well. These allegations included
11322600	11324600	stealthing, which, as I understand it, is the
11324600	11326600	removal of the contraceptive device during
11326600	11328600	sex, without the consent of the partner.
11328600	11330600	Allegations also resurface surrounding
11330600	11332600	Moses's intent to date Trisha in the first
11332600	11334600	place, with some still wondering if he was just there
11334600	11336600	for the money. He responds to some of these claims in a
11336600	11338600	tweet longer where he asserts that the main complainant
11338600	11340600	had an unhealthy obsession with him, which has
11340600	11342600	subsequently warped their view, sharing
11342600	11344600	DMs to supposedly substantiate this.
11344600	11346600	It brings one person's motive into
11346600	11348600	question, but it doesn't disprove the
11348600	11350600	claims themselves, especially the ones made
11350600	11352600	by others. With that said, it's hard to
11352600	11354600	comment further when you don't know these people
11354600	11356600	involved, and I honestly don't.
11356600	11358600	However, in the DMs, Ethan
11358600	11360600	expresses belief in the person levelling these
11360600	11362600	accusations, and seems to imply that Trisha
11362600	11364600	is being rather hypocritical in their stance.
11364600	11366600	They express visible distress to the situation.
11381600	11383600	This was clearly having a negative
11383600	11385600	impact on others as well though, with Ethan
11385600	11387600	announcing that he and Hila would be taking a week
11387600	11389600	off the podcast in light of everything. The stress
11389600	11391600	has just become too much for them to bear.
11391600	11393600	At this point, although I think everyone was exhausted,
11393600	11395600	people were by no means appeased, and
11395600	11397600	remnants of the feud persisted over the following
11397600	11399600	weeks, with a variety of people and media sources
11399600	11401600	contributing their think pieces.
11401600	11403600	Much of this occurred on fan forums, where
11403600	11405600	one person shared a message from someone who claimed
11405600	11407600	to be a former student at Trisha's school. They
11407600	11409600	attested that although the teacher in question had
11409600	11411600	been dismissed from their role for possibly
11411600	11413600	disreputable behaviour, it wasn't related to his
11413600	11415600	conduct towards the students specifically. Once again,
11415600	11417600	this wasn't verified, and to be honest, it's quite
11417600	11419600	hard to verify without people revealing private
11419600	11421600	details, which most people aren't, but
11421600	11423600	it was more food for thought. In response
11423600	11425600	to Ethan's request and pressure from the public sphere,
11425600	11427600	Trisha responded on the 15th of September,
11427600	11429600	with a video titled Addressing Everything.
11429600	11431600	I'm not going to go over the details
11431600	11433600	specifically, but Trisha maintains their stories
11433600	11435600	and in response to the new form narrative
11435600	11437600	of their supposed lying, contends that
11437600	11439600	knowingly lying is not the same as misspeaking,
11439600	11441600	which is what they feel they did. They say
11441600	11443600	they don't fact check and have a tendency to spew
11443600	11445600	second hand information without actually
11445600	11447600	understanding it themselves. They take responsibility
11447600	11449600	for that, but they don't agree with the characterisations
11449600	11451600	presented by many of their critics,
11451600	11453600	especially those in the forums.
11453600	11455600	There's a difference between misspeaking,
11455600	11457600	hearing things, and not getting all the facts right, not fact
11457600	11459600	checking, and
11459600	11461600	versus sharing
11461600	11463600	something you know to not be true for
11463600	11465600	the malicious intent of tricking someone or
11465600	11467600	making someone look bad.
11467600	11469600	And so,
11469600	11471600	I get stories
11471600	11473600	mixed up, I hear things from people, and I don't fact check, and that
11473600	11475600	was ultimately why I should never have had a podcast,
11475600	11477600	I should never have been in front of me, but
11477600	11479600	I'm not the only person in the world to
11479600	11481600	do that. Having said that,
11481600	11483600	I have never lied
11483600	11485600	about
11485600	11487600	any things that have happened to me.
11487600	11489600	The truth is difficult sometimes,
11489600	11491600	and sometimes we have to accept that we'll never
11491600	11493600	know the truth fully. What you ultimately had was
11493600	11495600	two very vehement factions, and when that
11495600	11497600	arises, it can be difficult to deal with.
11497600	11499600	It was certainly fostered in environments like Reddit
11499600	11501600	where fans of one side tended to convene.
11501600	11503600	I don't think it's completely fair to say that because
11503600	11505600	someone misplaced details, the whole
11505600	11507600	story is false, but at the same time,
11507600	11509600	Trisha's response still didn't placate the criticism
11509600	11511600	relating to stories where there was contradictory
11511600	11513600	evidence available. In a way,
11513600	11515600	no two situations are the same, and
11515600	11517600	they shouldn't be treated as such, even if
11517600	11519600	someone is an unreliable narrator, but when
11519600	11521600	the accusations at hand were becoming so
11521600	11523600	sensitive, the tensions were only flaring
11523600	11525600	further. As Trisha said while defending
11525600	11527600	Moses, people can lie,
11527600	11529600	and the question was whether that person
11529600	11531600	was Trisha.
11537600	11539600	In the week after their video,
11539600	11541600	Trisha removed over 1000 videos
11541600	11543600	from their channel, cleansing approximately
11543600	11545600	1 billion views of their work, and the week
11545600	11547600	after, Ethan announced the start of their new
11547600	11549600	collaborative project with the less controversial
11549600	11551600	Hassan Piker. Less controversial.
11557600	11559600	With the family connection also firmly
11559600	11561600	intact, as it would be fair to assume that this
11561600	11563600	would end the drama, especially with Ethan
11563600	11565600	seemingly making a commitment to withdraw from
11565600	11567600	discussing Trisha, and Trisha seemingly wanting
11567600	11569600	the drama to be over. However, a lot of
11569600	11571600	internet criticism persisted, particularly
11571600	11573600	the two sides who wanted to portray
11573600	11575600	the other side as dishonest, because what we
11575600	11577600	saw was a stalemate, which meant
11577600	11579600	fans felt completely free to make assumptions
11579600	11581600	about the characters of people they were criticising.
11581600	11583600	After being referenced in Ethan's stream, accounts
11583600	11585600	dedicated to publicising alleged inconsistencies
11585600	11587600	such as contradictions of Trish
11587600	11589600	on TikTok began to pick up traction,
11589600	11591600	only further creating groundswell around these
11591600	11593600	narratives. The account raises interesting points,
11593600	11595600	though at the same time, some of these clips
11595600	11597600	are a decade apart and are considerate of the fact
11597600	11599600	that people's perspectives change, but
11599600	11601600	we'll come to that in a moment.
11601600	11603600	Besides that, there were still occasional illusions
11603600	11605600	to each other's existence, and with Trisha's upcoming
11605600	11607600	marriage to Moses, it was hard to keep them both
11607600	11609600	out of mind too much, particularly when such
11609600	11611600	an event would usually bring the family together.
11627600	11629600	On December 10th, in a stream the day before
11629600	11631600	Trisha's wedding, Ethan made a comment in passing
11631600	11633600	that tomorrow was Hila's birthday,
11633600	11635600	which would have been the 11th. However,
11635600	11637600	Hila's birthday is actually on the 12th. This caused
11637600	11639600	some of Trisha's fandom to claim that Ethan and
11639600	11641600	Hila were lying about their birthday, to purposely
11641600	11643600	draw more hate towards Trisha, as some
11643600	11645600	other fans had also been claiming that Trisha was
11645600	11647600	purposely mimicking impactful dates of the
11647600	11649600	clients in a continued attempt to provoke them.
11655600	11657600	Going over the stream, it seems that Ethan may be
11657600	11659600	celebrating Hila's birthday on a Saturday, as he
11659600	11661600	declares that he's recording another episode of Leftovers,
11661600	11663600	the one with Hasan Biker, on the Sunday.
11663600	11665600	It'd be one hell of a way to try and rile
11665600	11667600	his fans up, though as shown, many audience
11667600	11669600	members' perspectives were so cynical that
11669600	11671600	they couldn't help but theorise if every comment
11671600	11673600	had an underlying meaning. It's unsure whether
11673600	11675600	either party believed that the other was taking
11675600	11677600	backhanded jabs at them, but this all seemed to
11677600	11679600	boil over when Trisha posted a rather tone-deaf
11679600	11681600	TikTok barely a few days after the wedding.
11681600	11691600	I mean, tone-deaf
11691600	11693600	is one way to put it, but it is just ridiculous
11693600	11695600	that they thought this was a good idea.
11695600	11697600	I mean, it's not an active admission that it's
11697600	11699600	what they did, but it's a pretty heavy inference.
11699600	11701600	I can't really see any other punchline
11701600	11703600	there, I'm pretty sure those dance moves
11703600	11705600	don't directly relate to Judaism, unless
11705600	11707600	they're implying that such seductive dance moves
11707600	11709600	are payment, but I have to admit I'm not familiar
11709600	11711600	with that currency either. Either way, it's
11711600	11713600	anti-Semitic, and Ethan, displeased with this,
11713600	11715600	decided to break his vow of silence and directly
11715600	11717600	address Trisha in a response.
11717600	11719600	So you say you couldn't finish your
11719600	11721600	conversion classes, which
11721600	11723600	tells me that you don't care
11723600	11725600	enough about the culture to put in the
11725600	11727600	actual work to do it the right way,
11727600	11729600	and then you say that you just paid off a
11729600	11731600	rabbi to just say you're
11731600	11733600	Jewish, which is, first of all, a lie,
11733600	11735600	no rabbi would do that, and second of all,
11735600	11737600	anti-Semitic, because it just propagates
11737600	11739600	the notion that Jews only care about
11739600	11741600	money, and that's very
11741600	11743600	serious, you know, the whole
11743600	11745600	thing is just disgusting,
11745600	11747600	frankly, and if you don't want me to
11747600	11749600	stitch your anti-Semitic TikToks,
11749600	11751600	then turn Stitch off, I don't want to hear you
11751600	11753600	bitch about that, and the worst thing
11753600	11755600	about all this is that there's people
11755600	11757600	around you that know better.
11757600	11759600	One of these was done on TikTok where it explains how
11759600	11761600	Trisha was harmfully stereotyping those from his
11761600	11763600	religion, have a clearly feeling like he had not
11763600	11765600	contributed enough to the discourse, decided to
11765600	11767600	dedicate a section of his off-the-rails soundbite
11767600	11769600	stream to Trisha's comments, explaining
11769600	11771600	that with the wedding behind them, he had no reason
11771600	11773600	to hold back, attacking both Trisha,
11773600	11775600	Moses, and everyone else in the blast radius.
11775600	11777600	It seemed like a pretty cathartic experience
11777600	11779600	for him all in all. The soundbite of Trisha's
11779600	11781600	sister discussing the 5%
11781600	11783600	subsequently won the bitterly fought knockout
11783600	11785600	tournament, seemingly becoming immortalised
11785600	11787600	in H3 history.
11787600	11789600	Oh!
11789600	11791600	Oh!
11791600	11793600	17,000 votes
11793600	11795600	take that 5%, has gained
11795600	11797600	the lead, 51% take that
11797600	11799600	5%, it's all
11799600	11801600	unfolding. It is all
11801600	11803600	unfolding here at the
11803600	11805600	2021 H3.
11805600	11807600	He takes that 5%.
11807600	11809600	I'm speechless folks. It's clear that
11809600	11811600	although he hadn't spoke about the matter publicly for a
11811600	11813600	couple months, he hadn't stopped thinking about it.
11813600	11815600	As he had come equipped with a plethora of evidence
11815600	11817600	and anecdotes to combat the narrative
11817600	11819600	propounded by Trish and those around them.
11819600	11821600	In fact, this is arguably his most ruthless
11821600	11823600	stream of them all, showing very little regard
11823600	11825600	for the backlash that he may instigate, and revealing
11825600	11827600	some rather personal details about
11827600	11829600	Trisha.
11845600	11847600	I don't owe any
11847600	11849600	shit to anybody. And actually the
11849600	11851600	worst part is that Moses knows better.
11851600	11853600	I mean, he's f***ing enabling
11853600	11855600	straight up anti-Semitic
11855600	11857600	harmful tropes, making
11857600	11859600	a mockery of the religion, and
11859600	11861600	it's f***ing disgusting and they should both be
11861600	11863600	deeply ashamed and f*** them both. Peace
11863600	11865600	and love. By the way, this is coming
11865600	11867600	from the girl who did like
11867600	11869600	has done OF videos with her
11869600	11871600	whole f***ing family. So don't
11871600	11873600	feign like that you're so outraged
11873600	11875600	by this candle story.
11875600	11877600	You know, I mean, Kaylee,
11877600	11879600	if you were so worried about your mom
11879600	11881600	not knowing the intimate details of your
11881600	11883600	sex life, don't make
11883600	11885600	OF videos with her, you
11885600	11887600	f***ing freak.
11887600	11889600	And by the way,
11889600	11891600	people have dug up so many videos of Trisha
11891600	11893600	and Kaylee talking
11893600	11895600	with like really
11895600	11897600	detailed questions
11897600	11899600	about sex
11899600	11901600	with their mom.
11901600	11903600	Like disgusting, weird
11903600	11905600	shit that I would never in a million years
11905600	11907600	want to discuss. So you know what, Kaylee?
11909600	11911600	That wedding is over.
11911600	11913600	F*** you and your whole family.
11913600	11915600	How about that?
11915600	11917600	F*** you and the womb you came
11917600	11919600	out of.
11919600	11921600	How
11921600	11923600	about that, Kaylee?
11923600	11925600	And once I asked
11925600	11927600	once I
11927600	11929600	asked Moses if
11929600	11931600	she ever asked him to pretend
11931600	11933600	like he's Hila, and he said
11933600	11935600	yes, but he refuses to.
11935600	11937600	Well, if you ask Moses, they're all
11937600	11939600	water, so incest is fine.
11939600	11941600	All sex is the best to Moses
11941600	11943600	when everyone's water. He's like, hey, it's
11943600	11945600	all good, baby. Defense of like why-
11945600	11947600	I deleted it after I was up, after
11947600	11949600	everyone was telling me how f***ing dumb of a
11949600	11951600	take it was, but it was-
11951600	11953600	but everybody already downloaded it.
11953600	11955600	You already said it, and you tried some shit.
11955600	11957600	It ain't my f***ing
11957600	11959600	fault. You're an influencer. Don't act like you're not.
11959600	11961600	She is. She's been on the
11961600	11963600	videos. She has her own OF
11963600	11965600	account. She's
11965600	11967600	she's an internet personality. I don't give up.
11967600	11969600	So
11969600	11975600	got 5% of an operating brain.
11975600	11977600	Oh boy.
11979600	11981600	I was bottled up. What can I do?
11981600	11983600	Ethan isn't a person who necessarily
11983600	11985600	abides by the internet's code of honour
11985600	11987600	for the time, and whereas the milder individuals
11987600	11989600	who spectate this may find its savagery
11989600	11991600	a bit disconcerting, Ethan seems to be
11991600	11993600	under the impression that this is his justice
11993600	11995600	for all the times he has felt wronged by
11995600	11997600	Trisha's behaviour, their lies, their manipulation.
11997600	11999600	This was his chance to deliver that
11999600	12001600	blow. However, Trisha obviously didn't
12001600	12003600	respond well, releasing a video pleading with him
12003600	12005600	to leave her alone, calling both Ethan and
12005600	12007600	Ela obsessed, and basically every other word under
12007600	12009600	the sun that would frame them as a victim to the client's
12009600	12011600	endless tirade of abuse.
12011600	12013600	Every little jab,
12013600	12015600	every video
12015600	12017600	he's made obsessing about me.
12017600	12019600	It always
12019600	12021600	scares me.
12021600	12023600	The backlash I receive from
12023600	12025600	their subreddit and their fans
12025600	12027600	to Ethan himself just
12027600	12029600	obsessing over
12029600	12031600	every little thing I do.
12031600	12033600	Meanwhile, Ethan can't stop talking about
12033600	12035600	me. Can't stop getting
12035600	12037600	bans and strikes going off on Twitter
12037600	12039600	on just random people blocking his
12039600	12041600	content and just being so angry
12041600	12043600	and
12043600	12045600	lawsuits and all this stuff like that.
12045600	12047600	And I get it.
12047600	12049600	I get he's probably himself
12049600	12051600	in a dark place right now. Like, I really could
12051600	12053600	see that. I was like, I know he's in a dark
12053600	12055600	place, so OK, I'll take a couple jabs.
12055600	12057600	But this F them and
12057600	12059600	anti-Semitic and Moses enabling, talking
12059600	12061600	about Moses, talking about my sister, people
12061600	12063600	who literally did nothing in
12063600	12065600	this situation and bringing my
12065600	12067600	sister again, just
12067600	12069600	knowing he's inciting
12069600	12071600	all of this.
12071600	12073600	It went from having the
12073600	12075600	absolute best weekend
12075600	12077600	of my life
12077600	12079600	to this and everyone,
12079600	12081600	my family and Moses and
12081600	12083600	oh, he wants a reaction. Don't let him
12083600	12085600	get this reaction. And I'm like,
12085600	12087600	don't let him know that he ruined your
12087600	12089600	best weekend. I said, but he did.
12089600	12091600	He won. Like, can you
12091600	12093600	stop now? Please.
12093600	12095600	Like, please.
12095600	12097600	In this case, unlike previous
12097600	12099600	videos, Ethan relented and cut out
12099600	12101600	a large proportion of his Trisha rant.
12101600	12103600	It's also important to note that Ethan
12103600	12105600	was facing a pretty harsh set of characterisations
12105600	12107600	from an individual known as Ryan
12107600	12109600	Cavanagh, who had initiated a lawsuit against
12109600	12111600	the client. His lawsuit mentions Trisha by
12111600	12113600	name and frames them as a victim of
12113600	12115600	Ethan's actions. Ethan had been vocal about
12115600	12117600	the stress this lawsuit had caused him and may
12117600	12119600	have not wanted to increase any risk of
12119600	12121600	defeat, given that the case explicitly
12121600	12123600	mentions defamation on multiple
12123600	12125600	occasions. Ryan had also been blocking
12125600	12127600	many of Ethan's videos which he had tweeted
12127600	12129600	about around the time, and not too long after
12129600	12131600	he was again blocked from uploading after an
12131600	12133600	old video was supposedly mass reported
12133600	12135600	by trolls. Once more,
12135600	12137600	Ethan announced that he would take another break
12137600	12139600	even after having the strike removed.
12139600	12141600	It seemed that his attempt to close out this story
12141600	12143600	was opening more new wounds.
12143600	12145600	But why? Well,
12145600	12147600	because there's no situation
12147600	12149600	with Trisha in which you can win.
12155600	12157600	If
12157600	12159600	the contradictions of Trish's
12159600	12161600	TikTok account and other commentators
12161600	12163600	highlighted something, it's that Trisha
12163600	12165600	is probably the most inconsistent person
12165600	12167600	online. Now I divide these
12167600	12169600	inconsistencies into three components,
12169600	12171600	personal evolution, small
12171600	12173600	talk disparities, and inexplicable
12173600	12175600	lies. For example,
12175600	12177600	People asking about nanny and a bar mitzvah,
12177600	12179600	you know it's hard to say, it's hard to say until it happens,
12179600	12181600	like I would like to try
12181600	12183600	obviously without a nanny, I really
12183600	12185600	don't judge anyone that has them. When I have a kid,
12185600	12187600	I'm not gonna have nannies, that's pretty damn sure. What does that mean?
12187600	12189600	You're trying to attack our parental
12189600	12191600	abilities? There's something wrong with having a nanny?
12191600	12193600	My eyes, yes.
12193600	12195600	This one isn't really a direct contradiction,
12195600	12197600	especially with the context that at the time
12197600	12199600	they were trying to spite Ethan. It could just
12199600	12201600	be Trisha coming round to the idea of a nanny
12201600	12203600	and the possible merits to it, especially as
12203600	12205600	they are now pregnant. Small talk
12205600	12207600	disparity, on the other hand, doesn't really
12207600	12209600	show much growth between conflicting
12209600	12211600	statements, but also could be explained
12211600	12213600	by the fact that Trisha is someone who talks a lot
12213600	12215600	and their opinions seem to fluctuate
12215600	12217600	rather turbulently, but also ultimately
12217600	12219600	too inconsequential to care about.
12219600	12221600	The content people seemed most alarmed by
12221600	12223600	was the inexplicable lies, statements
12223600	12225600	that seemed impossible to make sense of
12225600	12227600	in the context of how the truth appeared.
12227600	12229600	My dog was because of David and Jason, they just surprised me
12229600	12231600	with it for a vlog and made me keep it even though I never asked
12231600	12233600	for a dog. And yes, we did talk about this,
12233600	12235600	but everyone was like, oh my god, you can't just surprise me with a
12235600	12237600	puppy, I have been wanting a puppy for a
12237600	12239600	really long time. We had talked about it for
12239600	12241600	a while that I wanted a Pomeranian, that my mom
12241600	12243600	would help me take care of it. Just to be clear, we did
12243600	12245600	talk about this and the plan was to
12245600	12247600	maybe give the dog to Trisha's
12247600	12249600	mom who really wants a Pomeranian. This was first brought into
12249600	12251600	context by the puppy clip, and although
12251600	12253600	certain falsehoods like the allegations against
12253600	12255600	a schoolteacher could be put down to confusion,
12255600	12257600	others like that relating to the puppy
12257600	12259600	are much harder to explain. Where's the
12259600	12261600	ambiguity there? Trisha said something
12261600	12263600	that was just apparently objectively
12263600	12265600	false, and that's far from the only example.
12265600	12267600	I said earlier that Trisha was most at ease
12267600	12269600	when firing off information and stories about topics
12269600	12271600	that interest them. That was when the
12271600	12273600	podcast ran at its smoothest, but it was only
12273600	12275600	because it was what made viewers and colleagues
12275600	12277600	feel most comfortable.
12289600	12291600	It's confusing and hard to really
12291600	12293600	understand, because you're often left thinking
12293600	12295600	why would you even need to lie about something
12295600	12297600	as trivial as that, but it's very difficult
12297600	12299600	to come to any other conclusion than that
12299600	12301600	this was intentional, but then the question
12301600	12303600	comes down to what motive causes
12303600	12305600	a person to state inaccuracies like
12305600	12307600	Trisha does, not just about one detail
12307600	12309600	or the other, but in general. Well, a simple
12309600	12311600	response would be that Trisha is a troll,
12311600	12313600	and they have been trolling long throughout their YouTube
12313600	12315600	career. On one hand, yes, this is
12315600	12317600	true, Trisha has been a notorious troll
12317600	12319600	since the early days of this platform, but on the other
12319600	12321600	hand, it seemed that trolling was a bit
12321600	12323600	more identifiable, particularly in the
12323600	12325600	narratives and the tone. It was also something that
12325600	12327600	Trisha claimed to have left behind them on a fair
12327600	12329600	few occasions when discussing it.
12353600	12373600	This was not
12373600	12375600	just a relationship that enabled Trisha
12375600	12377600	to post a few videos, this was a
12377600	12379600	fully fledged business partnership that generated
12379600	12381600	significant income for our prima
12381600	12383600	donna. It precipitated a romantic bond
12383600	12385600	that produced a marriage and a pregnancy
12385600	12387600	for all that to be a troll would require some
12387600	12389600	mastermind level preparation and
12389600	12391600	emotional robustness, that even Trisha
12391600	12393600	in all their longevity and fortitude
12393600	12395600	may not be capable of. What's the
12395600	12397600	alternative explanation then?
12397600	12399600	Well, I think the idea of Trisha being a troll
12399600	12401600	is reductionist. A troll is known to actively
12401600	12403600	carry out undesirable actions for attention,
12403600	12405600	and although Trisha has done that, they're not
12405600	12407600	just a lover of negative attention.
12407600	12409600	Trisha has a way of inserting themselves into
12409600	12411600	stories that makes them relevant to the situation
12411600	12413600	at hand. I think if any of the perceived
12413600	12415600	contradictions highlight a common factor,
12415600	12417600	these are often situations where the people who Trisha
12417600	12419600	may be commenting on are unlikely to respond
12419600	12421600	on a public platform in a way that may
12421600	12423600	illuminate these lies, either because they are
12423600	12425600	broad in drama that contains valid criticisms
12425600	12427600	so they struggle to respond in general, or they
12427600	12429600	literally can't respond. Trisha's
12429600	12431600	stories always seem to be rooted in
12431600	12433600	some grain of truth, but it's hard to know
12433600	12435600	exactly what followed.
12439600	12455600	One of the curious stories Trisha told back
12455600	12457600	in the day was about an interaction with
12457600	12459600	famous actor Robin Williams, who passed
12459600	12461600	on from this world far too soon. Trisha
12461600	12463600	stated that when they worked as a courtesan,
12463600	12465600	they'd pass across. This story was
12465600	12467600	recounted on their channel not too long after
12467600	12469600	Robin's passing, and repeated on the podcast
12469600	12471600	where Trisha brings it up, and then seems
12471600	12473600	hesitant to elaborate further.
12497600	12505600	Now once again with the
12505600	12507600	legacy of Robin Williams, and the awareness
12507600	12509600	that we have of his often complicated
12509600	12511600	and problematic character, it's not
12511600	12513600	in the realms of impossibility. At the
12513600	12515600	same time, it's another situation which
12515600	12517600	involves an admittedly rather unlikely
12517600	12519600	scenario with only one available source.
12519600	12521600	This is the case with a fair few
12521600	12523600	other public figures, and even private
12523600	12525600	ones. Although in many cases these stories
12525600	12527600	are mostly inconsequential, the discomfort
12527600	12529600	from Ethan's perspective was that he believed
12529600	12531600	he was used to prop up a false
12531600	12533600	portrait of someone, and it's not
12533600	12535600	hard to see why. It's important
12535600	12537600	not to understate the more sophisticated
12537600	12539600	aspect relating to Trisha's understanding
12539600	12541600	of internet culture. Trisha isn't
12541600	12543600	someone who just exists to lie, they
12543600	12545600	have desires and aspirations. I think
12545600	12547600	in this case the podcast provided platform
12547600	12549600	for Trisha to tell a new story that would
12549600	12551600	contextualise their behaviour, that would almost
12551600	12553600	be this new chapter in their life.
12553600	12555600	Trisha knows what to do to maximise
12555600	12557600	their attention, and although in the past the
12557600	12559600	best way to do this was through often
12559600	12561600	shallow provocation, here it was
12561600	12563600	actually to create a deeper, more sympathetic
12563600	12565600	portrait, one that would make them look
12565600	12567600	more human and have the audience rooting for
12567600	12569600	them. Many people would have that naturally
12569600	12571600	within their character, but with Trisha it's
12571600	12573600	like another persona for each moment.
12573600	12575600	Trisha nature to adapt to situations
12575600	12577600	and bring themselves to the forefront of conversation
12577600	12579600	is so prominent that they couldn't help
12579600	12581600	but misrepresent certain situations, while
12581600	12583600	spectators looked on and nodded their head.
12583600	12585600	When Trisha was caught up in lies before
12585600	12587600	in their first appearance on the H3
12587600	12589600	podcast, when the lies were quite
12589600	12591600	obvious, people didn't feel so threatened
12591600	12593600	by them, but as people bought into
12593600	12595600	the greater story in its entirety
12595600	12597600	the impact clearly affected people
12597600	12599600	more significantly. While the
12599600	12601600	podcast was running smoothly, everything
12601600	12603600	went well for them, their platform was used
12603600	12605600	and it's clear that many began to fall in
12605600	12607600	love with the Trisha they thought they were becoming
12607600	12609600	familiar with, and because they deemed Trisha
12609600	12611600	a likeable individual, very few
12611600	12613600	questioned these stories. I don't know
12613600	12615600	Trisha inside out to say without a shadow
12615600	12617600	of a doubt that they actively, intently
12617600	12619600	lied, but they
12619600	12621600	did not tell the truth, and in the months
12621600	12623600	following it was clear that Ethan grew bitter
12623600	12625600	believing that he had been duped into providing
12625600	12627600	a platform for someone to speak so carelessly
12627600	12629600	and using his trust to provide an
12629600	12631600	extra veneer of credibility,
12631600	12633600	but that's only one perspective.
12633600	12635600	What's the other? How much blame
12635600	12637600	can we assign to Trisha
12637600	12639600	and how much can we assign elsewhere?
12667600	12677600	In the kind of months after their
12677600	12679600	pre-Christmas battle, though Ethan and Hila
12679600	12681600	had mostly cleaned up their legal obligations
12681600	12683600	relating to Ryan Cavanagh, the release of certain
12683600	12685600	pressures didn't draw them back to the topic of
12685600	12687600	Trisha, other than a few subtweets,
12687600	12689600	likely because Ethan going full mask off wasn't
12689600	12691600	actually a rewarding experience.
12691600	12693600	Trisha did what many expect, and put Ethan in a
12693600	12695600	position where if he said any more, he'd be the
12695600	12697600	aggressor, he'd be the one unduly
12697600	12699600	ruining a person's honeymoon, yet
12699600	12701600	many were still frustrated, pointing towards
12701600	12703600	all the times that Trisha had spoken endlessly
12703600	12705600	about Frenemies after they broke up,
12705600	12707600	but unfortunately, they're not quite
12707600	12709600	the same, are they? One is
12709600	12711600	Ethan, and one is Trisha.
12711600	12713600	Many of the accounts that we've used today,
12713600	12715600	and many of the people who've taken to call Trisha
12715600	12717600	out for their behaviour during Frenemies, were
12717600	12719600	completely on board only months before,
12719600	12721600	despite the fact that many of Trisha's comments
12721600	12723600	were firstly made on Frenemies, and made long
12723600	12725600	before Frenemies, statements that were well known
12725600	12727600	and acknowledged at the time.
12727600	12729600	In many ways, Trisha's demeanour always strangled
12729600	12731600	the line of trolling master seriousness,
12731600	12733600	and people expressing outrage at this shouldn't
12733600	12735600	necessarily be that surprised.
12735600	12737600	Trisha did exactly what they normally do.
12737600	12739600	Isn't this what we expected to happen
12739600	12741600	anyway? In Trisha's first collaboration
12741600	12743600	with the clients, they were called out for specifically
12743600	12745600	lying about a rather important detail
12745600	12747600	relating to drama. Surely, it was obvious
12747600	12749600	that this was a pattern.
12749600	12751600	This channel called
12751600	12753600	Psych In Real Life, they did how Frenemies
12753600	12755600	reveals a mental health misconception
12755600	12757600	perpetuated by the internet. This was a really good one.
12757600	12759600	This was someone who was in our favour.
12759600	12761600	Some people are in our favour that we
12761600	12763600	show the ugly side of BBT.
12763600	12765600	They're like, you know what? Everyone's a mental health
12765600	12767600	advocate until it's ugly, and so...
12767600	12769600	So another theory
12769600	12771600	began to arise, and although I don't think
12771600	12773600	it's the most popular one, I think it's worth
12773600	12775600	addressing nonetheless, particularly given the
12775600	12777600	undercurrents of mental health. As discussed
12777600	12779600	earlier, many felt that given Trisha's noted
12779600	12781600	instability, responsibility ultimately fell on
12781600	12783600	Ethan for platforming them in the first place.
12783600	12785600	While the initial appeals of Frenemies was
12785600	12787600	that Trisha Paytas was such an interesting
12787600	12789600	character, and that they often lacked a filter,
12789600	12791600	and would say stuff that people do deem offensive,
12791600	12793600	Trisha never deviated from how they were
12793600	12795600	known to behave, so why was it fair to
12795600	12797600	treat them any other way? I think the
12797600	12799600	problem is that this ultimately arose
12799600	12801600	from the desire to keep the podcast together.
12801600	12803600	Friendly bias, and some of Dr. Drew's
12803600	12805600	less helpful advice. Ethan did obviously
12805600	12807600	treat Trisha differently when they were a part
12807600	12809600	of the podcast. Although he was no pushover,
12809600	12811600	he didn't really treat Trisha's worst
12811600	12813600	comments with the seriousness that they could have
12813600	12815600	been treated as a critic, or even
12815600	12817600	as a friend, and some would even say that
12817600	12819600	he almost left people to observe it like a
12819600	12821600	specimen under a microscope. It was
12821600	12823600	part of the theatre, it could easily blur
12823600	12825600	the lines between melodrama and serious
12825600	12827600	disputes. In the months after, it
12827600	12829600	became easy to view what seemed like
12829600	12831600	melodrama at the time in a much more serious
12831600	12833600	light, and many did, but losing
12833600	12835600	perspective of the original context they were
12835600	12837600	viewed in. Exposing Trisha Paytas
12837600	12839600	is such a strange concept because everyone
12839600	12841600	knows so much
12841600	12843600	and so little about them at the same time,
12843600	12845600	and I don't know what you
12845600	12847600	could say about Trisha Paytas
12847600	12849600	that would surprise me. I spoke
12849600	12851600	earlier about Ethan's bias, and I think it's
12851600	12853600	what made him a contentious figure.
12853600	12855600	During the Keemstar Girlfriend drama, a clip
12855600	12857600	began to circulate of what he said to Boogie,
12857600	12859600	another creator on the older side who'd had
12859600	12861600	an interaction with a younger girl, and Ethan's
12861600	12863600	supposedly differing perspective.
12891600	12899600	Now this
12899600	12901600	once again harkens back to the hypocrisy
12901600	12903600	narrative that many assert, however I think
12903600	12905600	it more shows how often Ethan projects his
12905600	12907600	judgement of character onto an action
12907600	12909600	that many others may refrain from making assumptions
12909600	12911600	about. Ethan believes that Keemstar
12911600	12913600	is an inherently opportunistic, shady
12913600	12915600	individual, probably many worse words,
12915600	12917600	and therefore, from Ethan's perspective,
12917600	12919600	Keem's attraction to younger adults
12919600	12921600	is based on something more insidious than if it
12921600	12923600	was an action carried out by someone he had more
12923600	12925600	respect for. The only issue is that Ethan
12925600	12927600	often doesn't elaborate on this himself
12927600	12929600	and uses general logic that could be
12929600	12931600	applied to any of these situations, and
12931600	12933600	therefore, for people who don't think it's fair to
12933600	12935600	cross-apply those assumptions, these positions
12935600	12937600	will seem conflicting. I think
12937600	12939600	the Trisha fallout showed that friend-enemy
12939600	12941600	dichotomy that Ethan clearly experienced,
12941600	12943600	and in a way, it makes sense,
12943600	12945600	someone who you may perceive charitably may have
12945600	12947600	their faux pas viewed as requiring
12947600	12949600	education. However, if you come to the conclusion
12949600	12951600	that actually that person is not well-meaning,
12951600	12953600	then you may think that they already have the
12953600	12955600	education, they're just discarding it.
12955600	12957600	With that said, it is a distinct polarity,
12957600	12959600	and although some would say that Trisha
12959600	12961600	certainly poked Ethan until he bit back,
12961600	12963600	others would argue he unquestionably gave a platform
12963600	12965600	for a person who was known for their falsehoods
12965600	12967600	and then adopted a victimhood narrative
12967600	12969600	when those falsehoods were turned against him.
12969600	12971600	It's not hard to wonder if the famous
12971600	12973600	episode 17 would have even been
12973600	12975600	considered for deletion if friend-enemies never
12975600	12977600	split up. As we've seen, it's very difficult
12977600	12979600	to use Trisha's words against them
12979600	12981600	because you don't know what's real and what isn't.
12981600	12983600	The truth is, no viewer or audience member
12983600	12985600	will ever truly know who Trisha
12985600	12987600	Paytas is or what they believe, because they
12987600	12989600	throw out so many statements that makes me question
12989600	12991600	if they know what they believe themselves
12991600	12993600	half the time. With this in mind, I think
12993600	12995600	some commentators and critics of
12995600	12997600	Klein and their fanbase found the long-term
12997600	12999600	reaction to the collapse of friend-enemies
12999600	13001600	slightly inauthentic. Trisha had
13001600	13003600	alluded to this narrative as well, regularly
13003600	13005600	claiming people only cared about certain
13005600	13007600	actions after they were antagonized by
13007600	13009600	the audience, and although somewhat inaccurate
13009600	13011600	I can understand the gist of it.
13011600	13013600	In essence, they're saying people like Ethan
13013600	13015600	only wanted the drama, only wanted
13015600	13017600	the controversy, only wanted
13017600	13019600	the tea and the hot takes as long as
13019600	13021600	Trisha was part of the podcast. Ethan
13021600	13023600	isn't stupid, and he's very outspoken about
13023600	13025600	the people he doesn't like and thinks should probably
13025600	13027600	be deplatformed for their behaviour, such as
13027600	13029600	Keemstar. Although these two did one
13029600	13031600	episode actually a very long time ago, Ethan
13031600	13033600	has repeatedly refused to share a
13033600	13035600	platform with him since, citing Keem's
13035600	13037600	behaviour as examples for why.
13037600	13039600	Some would argue that much of the stuff
13039600	13041600	that Trisha had done prior to the podcast
13041600	13043600	was no less concerning, yet they were
13043600	13045600	still taken on. How come?
13061600	13063600	Like, I get why he would think
13063600	13065600	that, you know what I mean? Because it's like
13065600	13067600	every week, you know, it's like I
13067600	13069600	have, I'm transgender, I'm just
13069600	13071600	I have personality disorder
13071600	13073600	and so people start to
13073600	13075600	think like, what is
13075600	13077600	really going on here? I get it.
13077600	13079600	I'm not mad about it, but Anthony Padilla of all
13079600	13081600	people, Mr. Fucking Woke, if there's
13081600	13083600	something wrong with someone, which there clearly is, let's say
13083600	13085600	I am, let's say I have a pathological liar
13085600	13087600	and there's some fucking disorder where I'm just like always needing
13087600	13089600	attention, like I have something wrong with me,
13089600	13091600	don't fucking attack someone because something's wrong, how about
13091600	13093600	get that person fucking help? How about butt out
13093600	13095600	because there's probably other people helping. People don't know
13095600	13097600	fucking shit when it comes to this stuff.
13097600	13099600	Well, I suppose more cynical viewers would assume
13099600	13101600	that once again it comes down in part
13101600	13103600	to control. Unlike a collaboration
13103600	13105600	with Keemstar, for example, Ethan had
13105600	13107600	an idea of how a podcast with Trisha could
13107600	13109600	go. He had relative control of it on his
13109600	13111600	platform, and at the time there was a notion
13111600	13113600	of that greater evil for both parties
13113600	13115600	to combat. Trisha did what Trisha was
13115600	13117600	brought on to do, and people catered to them,
13117600	13119600	and supported them, and although there were conflicts,
13119600	13121600	they were regularly brought back not too long after
13121600	13123600	with the expectation that if Trisha could be
13123600	13125600	kept happy, the podcast would continue.
13125600	13127600	Some might even say that Trisha's behaviour
13127600	13129600	was enabled by an environment that valued
13129600	13131600	their presence over the actual truth,
13131600	13133600	despite the fact that this contradictory evidence
13133600	13135600	was available during many of the discussions
13135600	13137600	they held. Trisha is an
13137600	13139600	autonomous adult, and therefore has to bear some
13139600	13141600	responsibilities for their statements. However,
13141600	13143600	if their inconsistency has been as consistent
13143600	13145600	as it's made out to be, some would claim
13145600	13147600	that Ethan isn't as innocent as people
13147600	13149600	might assume, that he must have had some awareness
13149600	13151600	of what he signed himself up for,
13151600	13153600	but didn't mind as long as he had control
13153600	13155600	of the environment that Trisha existed in,
13155600	13157600	as long as the narrative was on his side.
13157600	13159600	I do have a premonition
13159600	13161600	that I'm like, I feel like I'm gonna be like a Jimmy Fallon
13161600	13163600	and I'm gonna just have to leave this show and I feel bad
13163600	13165600	because you're so nice to me.
13165600	13167600	You're gonna move up,
13167600	13169600	you're gonna ascend to late night
13169600	13171600	and say, Ethan, I'm sorry,
13173600	13175600	we've had a good thing,
13175600	13177600	but I have to leave you behind.
13177600	13179600	Eventually we're gonna have to part ways, and when is that gonna happen
13179600	13181600	and what's gonna happen, like I'll feel bad if that's you
13181600	13183600	like what if, you know what I mean?
13183600	13185600	I'm pretty content,
13185600	13187600	I'm not looking to move up anywhere.
13187600	13189600	That's the problem with me,
13189600	13191600	I'm never content, I always think I'm gonna be doing better
13191600	13193600	and bigger things.
13193600	13195600	Some would always believe that Ethan just wanted to use
13195600	13197600	Trisha's controversial persona for the click based on the views,
13197600	13199600	without real regard for the place
13199600	13201600	that Trisha's inconsistencies and outbursts
13201600	13203600	came from. And although Trisha did consent,
13203600	13205600	was Trisha too in love with the attention
13205600	13207600	to even process the situation rationally?
13207600	13209600	Was it really responsible to provide
13209600	13211600	them with that space anyway?
13211600	13213600	Maybe Ethan only wanted Trisha for as long
13213600	13215600	as they played the part they wanted,
13215600	13217600	and the moment they attempted to take more control
13217600	13219600	was the moment they were no longer useful.
13219600	13221600	This is all just speculation,
13221600	13223600	and a reflection of how people view
13223600	13225600	the situation quite cynically.
13225600	13227600	And I want to make that click,
13227600	13229600	but it often did latch onto one key factor
13229600	13231600	of the podcast, particularly one with
13231600	13233600	such notable personalities,
13233600	13235600	and that is control.
13235600	13237600	So what did that control come down to?
13237600	13239600	Well, one statistic springs
13239600	13241600	to mind.
13269600	13271600	Okay, fine. And so we had to buy
13271600	13273600	But that was the first time we ever spent money on production costs.
13273600	13275600	It's not about that, dude.
13275600	13277600	It's literally about we are producing the show
13277600	13279600	and I'm taking a cut. I feel like that's
13279600	13281600	beyond reasonable.
13281600	13283600	Beyond reasonable.
13283600	13285600	5%. Do you realize how much 5% was of our last one?
13285600	13303600	As said, it's very hard to distinguish Trisha's true beliefs from the ones they push for provocative purposes.
13303600	13307600	There was one situation which I do feel represented Trisha's opinions from a fairly genuine perspective,
13307600	13311600	as it was one where their behaviour didn't benefit this arc of attention.
13311600	13313600	That is arguably the most memed issue of it all,
13313600	13315600	the 5% and what it represented.
13315600	13319600	Although Trisha is a person who often isn't completely honest with what they think or how they feel,
13319600	13321600	it's never without a greater motive,
13321600	13323600	and in absence of a trolling motive,
13323600	13325600	we have to ask ourselves,
13325600	13327600	what is so important about 5%?
13327600	13329600	In her whole family,
13329600	13331600	it's like they're all just sitting there counting the 5%.
13331600	13333600	It takes that 5%.
13333600	13335600	You got her whole family, you're just like,
13335600	13337600	the 5%.
13337600	13339600	That's a small number!
13339600	13341600	1, 2, 3, 4, 5!
13341600	13343600	Out of 100!
13343600	13345600	So 100 numbers, that's 5 of them!
13345600	13349600	Now the quotes and jokes run deep, and rightfully so.
13349600	13351600	I don't think there's anyone who believes that with the production costs,
13351600	13355600	Trisha and Ethan's profits should have been split completely evenly.
13355600	13359600	However, I do think the banter has often clouded the core points that were trying to be made,
13359600	13361600	but weren't completely unfounded.
13361600	13363600	It also reflects the ultimate flaw in the structure of Frenemies,
13363600	13365600	and the dynamic between Ethan and Trisha.
13365600	13369600	Both parties purported a sense of betrayal when discussing the capitulation of the partnership,
13369600	13373600	but they both gave a lot to be on the podcast before being thrown under the bus by the other,
13373600	13378600	and maybe this was because that in later episodes they seemed to become much more comfortable with each other.
13378600	13380600	Trisha was invited on the podcast by Ethan,
13380600	13383600	with Ethan owning all the production resources and investing in it himself.
13383600	13385600	Therefore, although it was hosted by both of them,
13385600	13389600	there was the steadying hand of Ethan to keep the show afloat under all circumstances,
13389600	13392600	which made sense given Trisha's unpredictable tendencies,
13392600	13396600	however it also meant that Trisha was almost always a guest on their own podcast.
13396600	13399600	Although their outbursts often resulted in certain concessions,
13399600	13402600	it also reminded people that their presence was still unreliable,
13402600	13405600	and didn't give them any stead to expect more control over production.
13405600	13409600	However, 35 episodes in, and half a year since the last serious quarrel,
13409600	13415600	I think Trisha believed that they had become enough of a mainstay to expect a bit more authority over the direction of the podcast.
13415600	13417600	The girl that he cheated on with is Ava Louise Girl.
13417600	13420600	He called her a gremlin. It's like, you fucked her.
13420600	13421600	Go off, Queen.
13421600	13422600	You can't fuck- I hate- I hate-
13422600	13423600	Go the fuck off.
13423600	13425600	Guys fuck girls, and because they got caught or whatever,
13425600	13427600	then they call the girl the gremlin and stuff like that,
13427600	13431600	like, oh, she was good enough to suck your dick, like what are you talk- Mike is such a woman hater,
13431600	13432600	and he hates sex workers.
13432600	13433600	Go off. Go off.
13433600	13435600	You can see this by Lana, he's cheated on her,
13435600	13438600	he's like publicly admitted to it in a game, saying he got head from people,
13438600	13439600	like he's so- he-
13439600	13440600	Oh, you know what?
13440600	13444600	This is the kind of guy that virtual reality has to get head from somebody
13444600	13446600	over in fucking Florida or wherever the fuck they are.
13446600	13447600	Go off.
13447600	13450600	And thinking that's cool, like, oh yeah, baby, give me- like, you are such a loser.
13450600	13451600	You fucked up, Mike.
13451600	13454600	You are some perfect example of small dick energy that you need a virtual person to suck your dick.
13454600	13456600	You psychopath.
13456600	13460600	It's no secret that they read the comments, and reception had really turned in the prior months.
13460600	13461600	One issue remained, though.
13461600	13463600	How are they to bring up this point of discourse?
13463600	13467600	Well, Trisha has a way of not bringing up specifically what they want,
13467600	13472600	rather pushing discussion in a direction that will eventually result in their desirable proposition.
13472600	13475600	In that final episode, it was a problem that clearly bothered them,
13475600	13477600	which is why they attacked the production aspect,
13477600	13481600	eventually escalating the situation to the point where the episode ended prematurely.
13481600	13486600	However, the 5% narrative in my mind was Trisha's logical entry point to this discussion,
13486600	13488600	and a clear signifier of what they wanted.
13488600	13492600	Basically, Trisha's point was that, as it wasn't 50-50 exactly,
13492600	13497600	because that 5% came from their own share, they deserved more influence in the decisions being made.
13497600	13500600	Ultimately, I disagree with this specific line of logic,
13500600	13505600	and I think you have to look more at the share from the perspective that this 5% was nobody's money to begin with.
13505600	13509600	However, I also think there was a case to be made for Trisha to have more of a say in certain decisions,
13509600	13512600	regardless of the money, because Frenemies was presented as a joint project,
13512600	13514600	and they were part of the appeal,
13514600	13518600	but that discussion didn't happen because of how Trisha subsequently handled it.
13518600	13522600	Now, the tinfoil hat guy in me would question how much of Trisha's outburst was calculated,
13522600	13525600	and I really can't say for certain in that case.
13525600	13530600	However, I would go as far to say that I think their announcement to step down was done with almost the opposite intent.
13530600	13534600	With people's desire to keep the podcast together, and the result of previous tantrums,
13534600	13540600	Trisha had every reason to believe that actually them standing down would prompt Ethan to do everything he could to keep the podcast together,
13540600	13546600	possibly having another Dr Drew episode which results in Drew recommending Trisha has more representation on the podcast,
13546600	13550600	and Ethan abiding by the expert advice. However, that did not happen.
13550600	13556600	The 5%, as amusing as it was, became that primary narrative to show that from Trisha's perspective,
13556600	13561600	they never really had any control, and for a podcast that they featured on, in their eyes that wasn't fair.
13561600	13566600	In my opinion, Trisha didn't want the extra 5%, they just wanted what it represented.
13566600	13571600	In the videos following the collapse of the podcast, Trisha emphasised that from their perspective their input wasn't valued enough,
13571600	13577600	and although certain points they made were contradicted pretty directly, once again bringing that intent into question,
13577600	13582600	I do think there was a tension that neither of them wanted to address until after they didn't have an obligation to each other.
13582600	13587600	Both Trisha and Ethan sought to emphasise how much they cared about each other, and I don't doubt that's true,
13587600	13590600	but I guess the question would be how much did they trust each other?
13590600	13593600	One clip from Ethan's video in particular seems quite relevant.
13593600	13603600	So she wants me to hire people, lease in industrial space, of which, by the way, the leases are usually 3 plus years on industrial spaces,
13603600	13611600	for something that she's inevitably gonna quit. Like, I mean, it's happened 3 times already, so like,
13611600	13615600	and guess who's gonna take all the risk on that? Me. I'm gonna risk my ass.
13615600	13620600	Here he states he didn't want to hand over more authority to Trisha in the say of the staff because from his perspective,
13620600	13624600	he was the anchor, and Trisha could walk out at any time without experiencing any repercussions.
13624600	13631600	This is true, but in a way he walks himself into cyclical reasoning, because what he says is only true because Trisha walked out
13631600	13636600	because of that specific reason, in which case Trisha would just reply, well that's where the 5% of my cut comes in.
13636600	13641600	Now as said, I don't necessarily agree with Trisha that a cut should give them a stronger say, necessarily,
13641600	13646600	I think it's much more to do with trust, but in this case all you do is prove that you ultimately didn't trust them,
13646600	13651600	and you can turn around and say, well they walked out, which proves that I shouldn't have given them a greater input anyway,
13651600	13656600	but if they walked out on the basis of that specific issue, then it doesn't really prove your point,
13656600	13660600	because Trisha would continuously push the idea that they were prepared to take more responsibility,
13660600	13665600	and that Klein would not grant them that. That was the significance of the 5% in their mind.
13665600	13670600	As noted earlier, there were some who found Trisha's nature to compare themselves with Ila Klein concerting,
13670600	13673600	some even going as far to suggest that Trisha was concealing feelings for Ethan themselves.
13674600	13680600	I wouldn't say that, but what I would say is that Ethan and Ila were able to launch the H3 podcast with the mutual trust
13680600	13685600	that a married couple would invest in themselves. I think Trisha wanted that feeling of partnership as well,
13685600	13690600	they wanted that even split, even leadership, even management, even power, ultimately though deep down
13690600	13695600	they knew that wasn't something that Ethan would ever be prepared to provide, and that just exposed those doubts once more,
13695600	13701600	and how they interpreted them. The core disagreement was this, Trisha clearly believed that Frenemies had outgrown
13701600	13706600	the platform of H3, and that it ultimately needed its own space to blossom. This was a discussion that needed
13706600	13712600	to be had openly and honestly, instead it came down to one number. That number wasn't important as a singular statistic,
13712600	13717600	but more for what it meant to Trisha, the fact that there would always be that difference between them,
13717600	13722600	that neither party was completely ready to trust the other, neither quite possessed that faith.
13731600	13745600	This is a serious message to everybody watching my update right now, peace and love, peace and love.
13745600	13751600	Again, with peace and love, and I mean this with peace and love, peace and love, peace and love, peace and love,
13751600	13755600	can you um, can you soundbite, I'm warning you with peace and love?
13755600	13759600	Peace and love, it's a phrase you heard a lot on the H3 Podcast and Frenemies.
13759600	13763600	It was first said by Ringo Starr, but quickly garnered meme status on the H3 Podcast.
13763600	13767600	At first it merely held meme status, but eventually it evolved into something greater.
13767600	13770600	Just don't eat the crust, why are you hating on the end?
13770600	13775600	Mmm, I think it's a way to keep skinny, Dolly Parton once said she only eats the first bite and not the last bite.
13775600	13777600	With peace and love it's not working.
13777600	13784600	I have lost three pounds this week, thank you very much, and guess what, I just ate the last bite.
13785600	13789600	With peace and love it's not working for you either, whatever you're doing, and you're working out.
13789600	13791600	I'm not even working out, and I'm skinnier than you.
13791600	13795600	Listen, I'm not calling you fat, I'm just saying.
13795600	13802600	Over time peace and love became a way to contextualise or mitigate a possible disparaging remark or negative statement in good faith.
13802600	13808600	Although not a method I would typically employ, I understand that some, especially Trisha, may have found that reassuring.
13808600	13813600	The problem is that eventually it begins to tire as a technique, particularly when sometimes it feels difficult to fully present something
13813600	13816600	as coming from a place of peace and love.
13816600	13826600	And so I say with peace and love that, you know, as a friend I have come to love and appreciate Trisha.
13826600	13831600	It's hard to do that when reflecting on her falling out publicly, and Trisha immediately uploading videos, tweets,
13831600	13835600	and everything under the sun about how they felt placed everyone else on the back foot.
13835600	13839600	Ethan was completely in his right to respond. Although it was a solid response in many ways,
13839600	13844600	there was also a sense of vexation at the fact that he had tolerated so much of Trisha's behaviour this time round,
13844600	13846600	and yet still ended up in the same position.
13846600	13852600	The problem is that when you have that building up, your narrative begins to spiral into that cynical perception of a person's actions.
13852600	13855600	Take the issue of Trisha wanting to fire the crew.
13855600	13862600	Is that I was talking to the crew like, Trisha wants to, I was like, listen, Trisha wants to hire a new crew.
13862600	13868600	Now as noted, Trisha did not say this directly, but I can understand why you'd seem to think that they are implying it.
13868600	13873600	Ethan admits he handled this situation incorrectly by paraphrasing Trisha's comments to the crew.
13873600	13878600	Javi doesn't actually walk back the notion of Trisha wanting to fire the crew, in fact continuing to mention it throughout the video,
13878600	13882600	even stating that Trisha had directly said they wanted to fire the crew.
13882600	13891600	If anyone was upset, it's because she said that she wanted to fire everybody and get a new staff that made people uncomfortable.
13891600	13896600	The reason they were upset that I misunderstood is because she said she wanted to fire them all.
13896600	13903600	Now Ethan is completely entitled to his interpretation of Trisha's comments, and Trisha hadn't done themselves any favours in the previous days,
13903600	13906600	but once again, it exuded a lack of faith in Trisha's intent.
13906600	13911600	Although Trisha had been unnecessarily rude about the crew, they hadn't explicitly stated that they wanted them fired,
13911600	13918600	and continuing to assert this interpretation cements your stance that you believe that their expression of these feelings didn't come from a genuine place.
13918600	13923600	Some may say, well he only has this interpretation because of how Trisha had been in the previous days,
13923600	13927600	but he asserts that this was his understanding before Frenemies had disbanded.
13927600	13932600	The wording of firing is also going to be quite evocative, because it often implies that people are going to be losing their jobs,
13932600	13939600	however in this case, as Ethan notes himself, these are people who work other jobs for the podcast, and therefore it was unlikely that this would be the case.
13939600	13946600	How did you hire Sam without consulting me? It's like, I'm sorry, this is our business, she's not just working on Frenemies.
13946600	13950600	Why do I need to consult you who I hire for my business?
13950600	13957600	I don't think his point is completely invalid, but I think it conveys a restrained bitterness that was never spoken about while the podcast felt redeemable,
13957600	13963600	which then skews the perspective of that specific case, and obviously causes more subsequent anger from Trisha in their responses.
13963600	13965600	He's bringing up running the whole crew list again.
13965600	13967600	We fronted the money, we-
13967600	13970600	In what world? You have all these receipts, show the fucking receipts Ethan.
13970600	13975600	Now, I think its presentation is clearly clouded by Ethan's own feelings about the situation,
13975600	13979600	but I do think it does represent that sort of thing that a peace and love tone cannot offset,
13979600	13984600	and although I think he had decent grounds to believe that Trisha may have been hinting at hiring a new crew for the podcast,
13984600	13989600	I think his representation just showed he hadn't progressed his opinion of Trisha as much as the viewers thought he had.
13989600	13991600	It was clear that he still harbored great doubts.
13991600	13997600	Trisha was no different either, even though they opened their video expressing love for Ethan that soon disappeared.
13997600	14002600	It's interesting he'll show all the DMs except the ones where I say fire the crew or what he said to me the night of things that happened,
14002600	14004600	in the order it happened.
14004600	14009600	Trisha's video is not the easiest to follow because it's Trisha, but even amongst the numerous anecdotes they can fire off,
14009600	14013600	you can tell that these are evident problems, and they've been evident problems for the longest time.
14013600	14016600	The whole leaving frenemies situation in itself was a good example,
14016600	14021600	but in all honesty, if you just watch back the episodes, there are so many moments where they clearly express hesitancy
14021600	14027600	to accept support or the peace and love vibe, likely because they weren't entirely happy with the podcast as it was.
14027600	14054600	As noted, I personally find it difficult to write off the idea that Trisha's departure was actually a stunt,
14054600	14058600	intended to result in further negotiations for an issue they viewed as present,
14058600	14064600	but if anything, they proved that they didn't believe that being honest with Ethan would actually bring about the desired result.
14064600	14070600	Instead of patiently talking it out, they believed they had to generate negative attention because they believed that was what Ethan would respond to.
14070600	14076600	They didn't trust Ethan, Ethan didn't trust Trisha, and they both clearly had issues but didn't have that open discussion
14076600	14079600	because they thought holding it back would prevent more harm.
14080600	14103600	In actuality, this only yields further frustration because then the other person has to consider the fact that you never really trusted them as a friend
14103600	14107600	and that they were just tolerating your presence for the maintenance of a business partnership.
14108600	14113600	Trisha was the worst person to experience that because they often seemed to seek justification for why people hated them,
14113600	14116600	which inevitably implanted the narrative that they were only used for views.
14116600	14120600	This then spirals and only furthers the bad faith interpretations they have of each other,
14120600	14127600	and in the remainder of 2021 we saw attempts from both sides to really twist the knife in because they believed it was the only justified response
14127600	14131600	when the other willfully tried to hurt them, far from that peace and love we'd seen before.
14132600	14136600	A 40's hour philosophy can only work as much as it's what a person positively responds to,
14136600	14142600	and to be honest, sometimes I think Trisha needed more than peace and love, or at least they required a tougher version of it.
14142600	14149600	It often represented the eggshells that Ethan felt like he walked on, something that Trisha specifically said they didn't want in messages and later videos.
14149600	14155600	However, if it wasn't what they wanted, why did they support it when it was first mentioned by the expert himself?
14161600	14190600	Trisha and Ethan really needed, with some private sessions, to talk about what frustrated them with a paid professional to make sure these problems didn't fall over,
14190600	14193600	and instead, what they received was this,
14199600	14201600	and the podcast suffered for it.
14202600	14206600	There's one video that I've refrained from talking about yet, because it may just be the worst of them all.
14206600	14211600	During the era where Trisha was attempting to talk about frenemies without doing it on their own channel,
14211600	14213600	they went onto a podcast with many people.
14213600	14218600	One of these people, though, was Dr. Drew, the former mediating party of previous therapy episodes.
14218600	14224600	In this video, when discussing the demise of frenemies, Drew continues to repeat previous narratives that he had imparted so helpfully
14224600	14230600	during his appearances on the defunct podcast in question, just with more confidence now that the two had actually parted.
14230600	14236600	It's really strange watching the man who was meant to help resolve it almost play into it, and the questionable narratives at hand.
14236600	14242600	In a way, I don't think Dr. Drew's core advice is of no use, but the problem is that he takes a lot of what Trisha says at face value,
14242600	14245600	and that ultimately nullifies a lot of his conclusions.
14245600	14250600	I was repeating them to him to help him understand them, and trying to frame his response to them,
14250600	14258600	because he's not the one struggling, although he's in the thing with you, he was evoked by what was going on with you.
14258600	14263600	I've already delivered a fair few criticisms of Dr. Drew, but I think with the full context of the face of the podcast,
14263600	14270600	we can now see the ramifications of clumsily handled relationship advice by fully understanding the actual problems that Trisha and Ethan seem to perceive.
14271600	14278600	The truth is that I'm very grateful for the experience we've had with Frenemies, and all the learning and growing and developing,
14278600	14282600	and the amazing growth that our channel has seen as the result of that show.
14282600	14288600	I mean, it's been popular and successful beyond what either of us anticipated.
14288600	14295600	Trisha wanted to transform the podcast, both they and Kline acknowledged its astounding success and view count in comparison to similar series on the channel.
14295600	14300600	Frenemies clearly had a presence in an audience of its own, and Trisha's interpretation to me seemed almost like a child,
14300600	14305600	wondering how long they would have to behave before Kline entrusted more responsibility onto them,
14305600	14309600	but Kline didn't want to move on that because he didn't want to rely on someone who may not stick around.
14309600	14312600	Why is that? Well, Ethan still didn't trust Trisha enough.
14312600	14317600	Ethan couldn't predict what Trisha would do and wasn't prepared to put that faith in his own judgement alone,
14317600	14321600	and that was something that should have been at least worked on during the two pivotal episodes with Dr. Drew.
14321600	14327600	In a perfect world, counselling would enable both parties to find closure, yet acceptance in the differences they hold.
14327600	14333600	This doesn't always happen, and for two people as diametrically opposed as Ethan and Trisha, maybe that could never happen.
14333600	14336600	However, the insight they received was probably the least helpful it could be.
14336600	14341600	It created this normal where problems were swept under the rug in the hope that ultimately the strength of the podcast would prevail,
14341600	14345600	but tensions boil over, and bottling up problems will eventually break bonds down.
14345600	14348600	There were eggshells that everyone was walking on, too afraid to address them.
14349600	14352600	From the beginning, we've always been combative, as opposed to you.
14352600	14357600	I know you're always team Trish, as opposed to, again, it's fine, but I know it was to exploit me, right?
14357600	14361600	He wanted me to walk off that set that day, so my attitude's different, which is fine.
14361600	14366600	I exploit myself, like I said, that's my one entertaining quality for the internet, so I was like, fine, that's fine.
14366600	14371600	But it's like, I knew that going into it that he was always trying to do another walk off, you know what I mean?
14371600	14373600	So it's a little different as opposed to you.
14373600	14378600	In many ways, it told Ethan to essentially seek appeasement for the sake of the podcast's longevity.
14378600	14383600	Repression isn't resolution, though, and if you have these apprehensions that persist, you should talk about them,
14383600	14386600	even if Trisha may find it upsetting or offensive in the moment.
14386600	14391600	In this case, longevity itself is still temporary because eventually these things break down,
14391600	14397600	because eventually you lose your patience or the other person picks up on the fact that you're still unsure of where you stand with them,
14397600	14401600	and begins to unravel themselves in an attempt to change that, that rollover mentality.
14401600	14407600	It showed itself as demonstrably detrimental when Trisha was trying to assert those worst expectations in that final episode,
14407600	14411600	because Ethan just went ahead and confirmed it to try and end the argument, to try and move on,
14411600	14416600	but sometimes people don't move on until they've cleared something up, until they've repaired that trust.
14416600	14423600	Thank you for giving me a third wave. I feel like I've gone through, Shane gave me the first wave, then David, then, oh, we're not falling out.
14423600	14427600	Well, we almost did, but we pulled through.
14427600	14430600	You're marrying my brother-in-law, so.
14430600	14431600	It's like we're stuck.
14431600	14433600	Kind of removing the options.
14433600	14435600	You haven't f'd your cat or anything.
14435600	14440600	I'm not the kind of dude who, like, holds grudges. I like to sell squash beef, especially with people like in my family.
14440600	14444600	Trust starts with transparency. Understanding boundaries is an important building block to that.
14444600	14450600	Trisha is wildly inconsistent, and hell, it may have been a lost cause to even try and understand what lines they would hypothetically draw,
14450600	14456600	but it would have been better than doing nothing at all. At the worst, it would have allowed the podcast to end on a note of mutual agreement,
14456600	14463600	something that proved impossible in the current environment, and was only illuminated by their conflicting interpretations of the unaired episode
14463600	14467600	where they attempted to settle those. But it wasn't just about Trisha's boundaries.
14467600	14471600	I think every single person, every group I've been with, Shane Dawson, David Dobrik, Ethan and his crew,
14471600	14477600	like, they're all these guys that are like, oh my god, Trisha's so crazy. Like, what the fuck? She says this crazy stuff, her crazy life.
14477600	14483600	Like, candlesticks up her ass, all this stuff. And then as soon as, like, I get triggered by it, it's like, oh, too much.
14483600	14488600	Oh, like, she's just a bad person. She uses, like, mental health. It's like, all of a sudden, it's like, you know, it's like, if it's too much,
14488600	14490600	they're like, disengage, disengage. It's weird. I don't know.
14490600	14496600	There are no two ways about it. The infamous December episode where Trisha loses their temper at Ethan and the absent Eli
14496600	14502600	was unacceptable behaviour for anyone, and although their conduct never approached that specific degree of volatility again,
14502600	14506600	it should have been outlined that they wouldn't receive the same treatment if that happened next time.
14506600	14511600	I think Trisha almost believed their loyalty to the podcast was assumed because drama was naturally inbuilt.
14511600	14518600	They repeat this on the Dr Drew podcast, but they continue to focus on that one event, the storming out, and not actually what followed.
14518600	14523600	I'm good about this. Okay, let's go through your stupid, I don't like this segment, just for the record, fan advice is a stupid segment.
14524600	14529600	I don't think Ethan's greatest issue with Trisha was their on-podcast behaviour in the final episode.
14529600	14535600	I think what more pushed him towards the conclusion that the partnership was beyond saving was the DMs that Trisha leaked themselves,
14535600	14540600	where they once more lose their cool, and Trisha announcing that they were leaving. However, this probably wouldn't have happened
14540600	14546600	if Trisha knew it wasn't going to work. In a couple of other notable instances, Trisha's explosive behaviour had been rewarded
14546600	14550600	with a seat at the negotiation table, with a therapist by their side. That didn't happen.
14550600	14555600	From my perspective, Ethan felt like he'd done everything to keep Trisha happy, and it still wasn't enough,
14555600	14560600	and at that point he decided that there was nothing else he could do, and concluded that accepting Trisha's resignation from the podcast
14560600	14566600	was the smartest route. This wasn't the first time that Trisha had said they were quitting, but it was the first time that Ethan rubber-stamped it.
14566600	14571600	If there had been an established method in problem resolution beyond just pushing it towards the backburner,
14571600	14576600	Trisha may never have considered leaving the podcast as an acceptable course to having their qualms recognised.
14576600	14581600	They needed a system for these problems that was mutually acknowledged that if breached, would bring about the show's termination.
14581600	14587600	If Trisha did have some form of rationale to their behaviour, then this would at least serve as greater motivation to not act in a way
14587600	14589600	that they did after the show's downfall.
14589600	14612600	It's very easy to point fingers at people directly involved in the drama, and to be honest, I think there is some responsibility that can be attributed there,
14612600	14617600	but I also think that sometimes you need the right guidance, and in this case that could only be provided by a professional therapist
14618600	14622600	who didn't have any biases, any priorities, or a public personality to maintain.
14622600	14627600	If you put the survival of a podcast above the survival of your friendship, and the openness that you can express in it,
14627600	14633600	then the podcast will suffer nonetheless. It is built from that friendship, or frenemyship, not vice versa.
14634600	14654600	As much as we can assign blame to subpar vice, it was also Ethan and Trisha's decision to bring Dr Drew on and abide by his wisdom.
14654600	14659600	If anything, the presence of a personality like Dr Drew showed that although the drama was personal,
14659600	14663600	frenemys were still just a spectacle, and it needed to be more than that to survive.
14674600	14681600	When Ethan started the H3 Podcast channel, I think he hoped that it would allow him to present a more unfiltered, authentic version of himself,
14681600	14685600	and in a way, he achieved that. However, he also experienced issues expressing that natural self,
14685600	14690600	and working it into conversations with other guests, and often getting into drama himself.
14690600	14695600	Drama and conflict aside, there was definitely a need to surround himself with people who would play off his best parts,
14695600	14702600	and ameliorate his worst. Nowadays he does that pretty successfully with his crew, but back then Trisha was the catalyst to bring H3 into a new era.
14707600	14712600	Who would have guessed that a few select comments could spawn such a tumultuous and memorable partnership in the YouTube history books,
14712600	14716600	and in many ways they did create something timeless, an experience that many were grateful for.
14716600	14721600	Given their characters at the start of the podcast, people really didn't believe it would last more than a few episodes,
14721600	14725600	but over time that expectation changed, and the investment manifested as well.
14725600	14730600	And for much of the time, the show appeared to undergo an evolution that transformed both Ethan and Trisha,
14730600	14734600	moving from a dynamic of tense rivalry to strong camaraderie.
14734600	14738600	With that in mind, there was a potential sadness that the podcast couldn't be something greater,
14738600	14741600	as it seemed to be progressing in that direction for so long.
14741600	14747600	I keep saying I love this show, and everyone just stopped the podcast, I'm like please don't stop this podcast, that's all I got going for.
14747600	14749600	Well let me read you what they said.
14749600	14752600	Without context, the episodes constructed a poignant story,
14752600	14757600	one where Trisha had experienced so much maltreatment and desertion that their own responses were a product of their reception.
14757600	14762600	In some ways it seemed like a believable account, particularly given the cannibalistic nature of internet culture,
14762600	14765600	and the conviction that Trisha spoke with made it all the more convincing.
14766600	14772600	It was an occasionally difficult but very sympathetic portrait of a person who was often judged quite harshly by the internet.
14772600	14777600	Additionally, it was a sobering moment for a lot of viewers, and maybe prompted a fair bit of reflection on their behalf.
14777600	14780600	However, often the problem with the internet is that it's a pendulum,
14780600	14783600	it judges it individually either far too harshly or not at all,
14783600	14787600	and in the deluge of sentimentality, some left their better judgement at the door.
14787600	14791600	So many were sold on it, and maybe if some had detached themselves a little more,
14791600	14794600	they would have picked up on certain lies designed to play up this story.
14794600	14798600	I don't think this means that Trisha hasn't suffered in their life, I want to make that clear,
14798600	14803600	but I do think they were too committed to it, too committed to a vision in their head that wasn't going to happen.
14803600	14810600	Trisha is a person whose words have often held very little impact online because of how notably unreliable and melodramatic they are,
14810600	14814600	but Frenemies changed the game for them due to the assumed realism of that podcast environment.
14814600	14818600	Unfortunately, although it was in a new format, it was the same old Trish,
14818600	14821600	and given they had proven to have lied a fair few times prior,
14821600	14827600	including during their debut appearance on the H3 podcast, it was almost impressive they managed to rope people in once more.
14827600	14834600	I think in this story, Ethan saw himself in a position where he could be the start of a healthier online relationship for Trisha.
14834600	14839600	He really did try to make that difference in their life, but they weren't quite ready to let Ethan in,
14839600	14844600	and I think Ethan picked up on that because Trisha knew that the podcast wasn't quite where they wanted it to be.
14844600	14847600	Trisha had greater plans for this story, and Ethan didn't.
14847600	14853600	I think deep down they both apprehended its collapse, either due to Trisha's own nature or Ethan's response to it,
14853600	14858600	and in a way, Ethan's subsequent reaction to Trisha's lashing out helped preserve the abandonment narrative in their mind.
14858600	14863600	I think every single person, every group I've been with, Shane Dawson, David Dobrik, Ethan and his crew,
14863600	14869600	they're all these guys that are like, oh my gosh, you're just so crazy, what the fuck, she says this crazy stuff, her crazy life,
14869600	14874600	like candlesticks up her ass, all this stuff, and then as soon as I get triggered by it, it's like, oh, too much,
14874600	14879600	oh, she's just a bad person, she's just mental, it's like, all of a sudden, it's like, you know, if it's too much,
14879600	14882600	they're like, disengage, disengage, it's weird, I don't know.
14882600	14883600	Right, yeah.
14883600	14884600	Then they abandoned it.
14884600	14885600	Yeah, exactly.
14885600	14888600	The difference is, at that stage, it was Trisha who left the podcast.
14888600	14894600	It wasn't Ethan's fault. The one thing that I would say Ethan was unequivocally right to do, though, was to accept the end of the podcast.
14894600	14900600	I have my problems with Ethan's reaction and response, I think I've made that clear, and I don't know the exact reasons behind his decision,
14900600	14904600	but he couldn't have maintained it in good faith with the then-present arrangements.
14904600	14908600	It was the best thing to do, not just for him, but for Trisha as well, and everyone around them,
14908600	14911600	and honestly could have helped preserve a good friendship.
14911600	14914600	To do so much in public, on one hand, can be raw and powerful.
14914600	14919600	On the other hand, it blurs the line between persona and person, and Trisha is so bad with that.
14919600	14923600	I know I've probably said that before, but it doesn't become any less true,
14923600	14926600	and as the personal relationships become more and more intertwined,
14926600	14932600	it was clear that these moments of conflict were only going to cause more harm to Trisha, Ethan, crew, friends, and family.
14932600	14937600	At the start, I noted that a podcast sometimes could only run as long as there is a motivation,
14937600	14942600	but in the case of Frenemies, the motivation to start the podcast was ultimately the motivation taken to end it,
14942600	14948600	because what initially benefited them became a detriment as they grew closer, that friendship.
14948600	14951600	Unfortunately, that friendship couldn't be saved because of what followed.
14951600	14954600	Trisha's phase distinguished between that public and private aspect of Frenemies,
14954600	14957600	and Ethan being pushed past breaking point when reflecting on it.
14957600	14960600	If you had a time machine, you could probably change a few things,
14960600	14965600	and maybe it would have kept the podcast alive a little longer, but maybe it would have imploded even sooner.
14965600	14969600	Who knows, I think the one element that may have been worth saving was the friendship itself,
14969600	14973600	removing that betrayal and reflecting on the intent of the parties on that podcast,
14973600	14977600	and with the family involved, maybe it would have been a more peaceful conclusion for all.
14977600	14981600	Instead we had one which dragged in other parties, over-invested fans to an extreme degree,
14981600	14985600	and always ended up exhausting everyone actually involved because they couldn't say anything final.
14985600	14990600	As much as it's entertaining for audience members and possibly cathartic for yourself to go mask off in a stream,
14990600	14995600	Stalemate is never satisfying, and when you pit yourself against each other in such a way that's all you're ever going to end up with.
14995600	14998600	As we've seen, if you wrong Ethan, he's often not afraid to hold back.
14998600	15000600	That's for better and for worse with him,
15000600	15004600	particularly when he wants to rip into someone the way he would occasionally advise against.
15004600	15006600	We're pretty PC in general, too.
15006600	15014600	Like it's a comedy podcast, but I feel like we're pretty respectful at the same time.
15014600	15019600	Um, so, I don't know. I think some of y'all are just too sensitive.
15019600	15021600	You're not a politician.
15021600	15023600	Yeah, exactly, and thank God for that.
15023600	15025600	Thank you, by the way, for defending me.
15027600	15032600	I feel like, you know, if you're watching this show and you're perpetually offended by things I'm saying,
15032600	15035600	you may want to just stop watching, like genuinely.
15035600	15038600	And I'm trying my best to learn when I can,
15038600	15044600	and I did take and learn what I could from Matt, and I listened respectfully.
15045600	15051600	But, um, to say it's gross and disappointing, which is a comment I'm reading specifically,
15051600	15059600	uh, is just, I think you're too sensitive for the show. I really do. I'm sorry.
15059600	15063600	Ethan is a regularly cynical guy who tries to be socially conscious, but often fails,
15063600	15066600	and will draw criticism for supposed pandering and double standards due to it.
15066600	15071600	Trisha and their loyal fans clearly possess this impression that Ethan still only cared about the podcast for its content,
15071600	15075600	and not for them, and maybe at the start when some people raised that concern it was a valid point,
15075600	15080600	but over time I do think Ethan's intentions evolved, which I think is what made him so bitter at the end.
15080600	15083600	I think he did care, and I think he was embarrassed at himself for caring.
15083600	15087600	You see me as a troll and a trickster and nothing's true.
15087600	15090600	You see me as that way because you see through your own lens.
15090600	15095600	You yourself are only seeing your own kind of shadow being cast on the world.
15095600	15096600	That's not true, I don't...
15096600	15097600	Trisha has a problem with the public sphere.
15097600	15103600	As acknowledged early on, there's evidently an issue with the fact that they don't value the consequences their words can hold,
15103600	15106600	and the implications they may have in a socially sensitive environment.
15106600	15109600	Even if the comments didn't directly affect the people that were being referred to,
15109600	15114600	there were others in those circles, and even on the podcast, that did feel that impact.
15114600	15119600	Whether Trisha cared too much about themselves or not enough about others is judgement I'll leave down to you,
15119600	15124600	but whatever the reason, it ultimately wasn't one made for a podcast, or the podcast.
15124600	15129600	I know some will probably be disappointed that I didn't comment on Trisha's personal life more,
15129600	15133600	particularly their contentious marriage to Moses, but simply put, I don't know enough about it.
15133600	15138600	All I'll say is that I think Trisha needs people around them who don't condone their behaviour just because it's Trisha.
15138600	15144600	Give Trisha a reason to be better. Trisha can get better, it's just a shame that that wasn't the result of the podcast.
15144600	15150600	It was a project that yielded so much for Ethan and Trisha, but also left the feeling that there could have been so much more,
15150600	15156600	and it had long overreaching personal implications, leaving some questioning whether it was ever worth it.
15156600	15162600	For what it is worth though, one thing I've learned from reading too many comments was that even if it wasn't quite what it appeared to be,
15162600	15165600	Frenemies was still a moment of divine escapism for many.
15165600	15170600	Those who came home on a Monday night, tired and daunted by the week ahead, had something to look forward to.
15170600	15178600	Two of YouTube's most recognisable and polarising figures providing their informed and occasionally uninformed takes on YouTube drama.
15179600	15187600	Frenemies was chaotic, problematic, and deeply flawed, but it was also a compelling story that many followed closely and wanted that fairytale ending from.
15187600	15192600	Sometimes fiction is more fanciful than reality, and this was one of those times.
15192600	15199600	Yet, even if its legacy has been tainted, in many people's hearts, Trisha and Ethan will always be Frenemies.
