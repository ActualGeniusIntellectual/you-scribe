00:00.000 --> 00:10.680
Have you guys ever browsed Instagram and wondered why everyone looks so beautiful?

00:10.680 --> 00:12.880
Why does everyone have such a perfect life?

00:12.880 --> 00:14.540
I'll tell you why!

00:14.540 --> 00:16.040
Because they're faking it!

00:16.040 --> 00:17.040
No!

00:17.040 --> 00:18.040
No!

00:18.040 --> 00:21.360
That cannot be the same person!

00:21.360 --> 00:24.440
Dude Coachella versus open casket funeral.

00:24.440 --> 00:27.320
You said I look like a corpse in like an open casket funeral.

00:27.320 --> 00:28.320
Yeah, you did!

00:28.320 --> 00:30.560
Well, my friends, here we are.

00:30.560 --> 00:37.480
They said it would never happen, me and Trisha making a podcast and frankly, I thought they

00:37.480 --> 00:38.480
were right.

00:38.480 --> 00:44.000
But let me explain, first of all, how what brings us to here, which is a pairing of very

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
bizarre.

00:45.000 --> 00:49.200
I've been wanting to make a podcast with like another comedian for a while and I don't mean

00:49.200 --> 00:51.520
that to compliment you.

00:51.520 --> 00:55.520
I think I mean like two big personalities and in my mind, when I kept trying to think

00:55.520 --> 00:59.300
of people to do it with, I always thought, you know, me and Trisha have a really funny

00:59.300 --> 01:03.560
chemistry and I thought, well, you know, fuck it, let's just do it like that.

01:03.560 --> 01:04.560
Let's do a live.

01:04.560 --> 01:05.560
Fuck it!

01:05.560 --> 01:06.560
All right, we're done.

01:06.560 --> 01:12.760
Thank you guys.

01:12.760 --> 01:14.640
We shouldn't have got pizza.

01:14.640 --> 01:20.780
Hello, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the right opinion, the home of a twat with

01:20.780 --> 01:25.660
too much free time and podcasts, something that I have a bit of a patchy record on.

01:25.660 --> 01:29.320
In principle, there's always something enjoyable about being able to present a more raw version

01:29.320 --> 01:33.460
of yourself, being able to speak casually without having to filter your mind so rigorously.

01:33.460 --> 01:37.360
It's also a less demanding job in many regards, and although the result is never identical,

01:37.360 --> 01:40.860
you can go into recording with a clear idea of who you're presenting to the audience.

01:40.860 --> 01:44.820
For me, I guess I'll always be someone who requires the rehearsed nature of scripts to

01:44.820 --> 01:46.220
maximize my full potential.

01:46.220 --> 01:50.480
And although I'm not adverse to making appearances on podcasts here and there, I think I need

01:50.480 --> 01:54.440
to focus my efforts on my content first and foremost, given how I have regularly failed

01:54.440 --> 01:55.680
to do that of recent.

01:55.680 --> 01:59.160
However, it is a thought that has taken up residence in my psyche.

01:59.160 --> 02:02.640
What if I was to drop everything I was doing now, set up a new channel with the resources

02:02.640 --> 02:06.740
I currently possess, and do something that doesn't require me tearing my hair out?

02:06.740 --> 02:10.920
In a way, it's a decision that Ethan and Eda Klein, also known as H3H3 Productions,

02:10.920 --> 02:14.980
made a few years ago when they decided to launch the H3 podcast, but let's rewind for

02:14.980 --> 02:19.740
just a moment in case anyone here is not fully equated with the YouTuber Viathan that is

02:19.740 --> 02:20.740
H3H3 Productions.

02:20.740 --> 02:25.100
Game assassins out there, you think I was born looking this cool?

02:25.100 --> 02:29.380
No, I used to look like you, losing to noobs every day.

02:29.380 --> 02:34.540
That is until I discovered gamer gear that got my fashion on point, and I never lose

02:34.540 --> 02:36.100
to noobs anymore.

02:36.100 --> 02:40.500
Gamer gear glasses, help you see the game and look cooler than ever.

02:40.500 --> 02:43.220
And our trademark item, gamer water.

02:43.220 --> 02:44.900
Dude, fuck yeah, man.

02:44.900 --> 02:49.180
H3H3 Productions is the YouTube channel run by the aforementioned Klein couple.

02:49.180 --> 02:53.020
They established a presence on YouTube for content that often parodied their subjects,

02:53.020 --> 02:57.180
usually utilising Ethan's offbeat sense of humour, alongside editing that put a somewhat

02:57.180 --> 03:00.020
amusingly absurdist twist on the content they were lampooning.

03:00.020 --> 03:03.780
Nonetheless, many of these videos also had an underlying moral message that resonated

03:03.780 --> 03:07.660
with many viewers, often calling out many of the creators of their time for their often

03:07.660 --> 03:09.780
shallow exploitation of YouTube culture.

03:09.780 --> 03:13.780
They're funny, they're well made, and many of them are still relevant to this day.

03:13.780 --> 03:17.540
They're videos I grew up with and will always find a place in my heart for, however a few

03:17.540 --> 03:20.900
years ago, as many of you probably know, they themselves became the centre of attention

03:20.900 --> 03:24.300
after one of the subjects of their videos, a gentleman by the name of Matt Hoss, decided

03:24.300 --> 03:25.820
to sue them for copyright infringement.

03:25.820 --> 03:30.140
It had been regularly debated on how much commentary constituted fair use, and with

03:30.140 --> 03:34.380
H3's videos there was an uneasy trepidation that maybe, if the ruling went in favour of

03:34.380 --> 03:39.340
the plaintiff, that a new gauntlet would be set down for further lawsuits in this domain.

03:39.340 --> 03:42.780
Fortunately the case was won by our protagonists here, and they triumphantly returned to the

03:42.780 --> 03:46.980
platform, cheered on by the platform itself and many creators whose livelihoods seemed

03:46.980 --> 03:50.820
to depend on the verdict, however you can't really undo the stress that such a case would

03:50.820 --> 03:54.380
cause you, and in the aftermath it seemed difficult to return to that content with the

03:54.380 --> 03:57.820
same sort of gusto that they'd previously bought, and it's hard to blame them.

03:57.820 --> 04:01.260
If anything, a lawsuit which required such an investment would inevitably sap the fun

04:01.260 --> 04:05.220
out of the content that in many ways served as an escape at one point, so over time they

04:05.220 --> 04:08.940
seemed to distance themselves further from the formula they had once been inseparable

04:08.940 --> 04:12.560
from, venturing into new pastures, including the one we mentioned earlier.

04:12.560 --> 04:13.560
The Podcast

04:13.560 --> 04:36.840
The H3 Podcast was founded on the 8th of April 2017, with the first episode being broadcast

04:36.840 --> 04:40.240
on the same day, a few months before the lawsuit was settled.

04:40.240 --> 04:43.680
This format seemed rather unexceptional on the surface, Ethan would bring on a guest,

04:43.680 --> 04:48.060
often someone with a pretty well established media presence, sometimes a real A-list celebrity,

04:48.060 --> 04:49.060
and they would shoot the shit.

04:49.060 --> 04:52.440
It's a concept that's been tried and tested over and over again, and although not always

04:52.440 --> 04:57.400
yielding groundbreaking results, you'd typically expect it to be a mostly uncontroversial formula,

04:57.400 --> 05:00.560
and at the start it certainly was, but then something began to happen.

05:00.560 --> 05:27.160
I think in a way it's a peril with any commentator that has a tendency to say what's on their

05:27.160 --> 05:31.940
mind at a specific moment, but something about H3 in the podcast environment didn't

05:31.940 --> 05:35.240
always hit the best notes for certain viewers, and fellow creators.

05:35.240 --> 05:38.100
There were moments that just seemed a bit out of step for his image, and eventually

05:38.100 --> 05:41.960
people began to express their frustration which generated controversy in itself.

05:41.960 --> 06:09.880
Now, H3 often did take time to address specific dramas, even occasionally admitting their

06:09.880 --> 06:13.520
flaws and shortcomings, and pledging to do better, however they seemed to also have

06:13.520 --> 06:17.940
an inexorable nature to be drawn towards the flame of conflict, and this is where we introduce

06:17.940 --> 06:20.560
the second character in this convoluted story.

06:20.560 --> 06:24.840
I feel like such a DIY right now.

06:24.840 --> 06:29.000
If we can make this fattuccini pink I will be so happy.

06:29.000 --> 06:34.120
So I'm just gonna go ahead and, hopefully don't get this all over me.

06:34.120 --> 06:35.840
I don't know what food coloring really tastes like.

06:35.840 --> 06:39.060
I don't think it's supposed to have a taste?

06:39.060 --> 06:42.080
Whoa, first of all, it's sporting literally everywhere.

06:42.080 --> 06:43.320
Can't relate.

06:43.320 --> 06:48.600
This looks more red, but the cap is pink.

06:48.600 --> 06:54.860
Okay, we're gonna try and not... This looks like... not appetizing.

06:54.860 --> 06:58.740
This is Trisha Paytas, they are a veteran creator and no stranger to this channel.

06:58.740 --> 07:03.860
It's difficult to talk about what they do at length, because they tend to be more of a YouTube socialite at this point,

07:03.860 --> 07:09.260
renowned for their own involvement with the platformer elites and dramas that these dynamics occasionally precipitate.

07:09.260 --> 07:12.860
They're outspoken, often unapologetic, and quite unpredictable.

07:12.860 --> 07:18.220
In many ways, they're not the prime candidate for the co-host of a podcast that seems to be trying to clean up its act.

07:18.220 --> 07:24.560
In many ways, they were the polar opposite of someone like Ethan who seemed to care deeply about his public image, and yet...

07:24.560 --> 07:28.900
Ethan- Well, my friends, here we are. They said it would never happen.

07:28.900 --> 07:35.460
It happened. In fact, its life cycle was longer than many probably predicted, with a total episode count just shy of 40.

07:35.460 --> 07:40.740
However, to nobody's surprise, there was still no lack of fireworks, and even when the podcast soared to its highest peaks,

07:40.740 --> 07:44.720
it could only have forebode its inevitable demise, and yet it didn't even end there.

07:44.720 --> 07:47.300
In fact, it seems to have only escalated.

07:47.300 --> 08:13.420
There's a lot more to the story of H3 and Trish's relationship that underlines the characters of both parties involved,

08:13.420 --> 08:17.180
a few that long existed and will long outlive many other dramas.

08:17.180 --> 08:22.820
If you're interested in the story, then I suggest we follow it a little further, but to unravel the story in its entirety,

08:22.820 --> 08:30.060
we need to first head back to 2019, where these two strangers first became acquainted, and sowed the seeds for their ill-fated podcasts.

08:30.060 --> 08:34.060
Let's see how these frenemies became, well, friends and enemies.

08:34.060 --> 08:41.940
But first, ad time. The following ad is region and age specific, so if you're under 21 or live outside the United States,

08:41.940 --> 08:47.740
then this is unlikely to apply to you. The following ad also contains depictions of recreational drug use,

08:47.740 --> 08:53.460
so if that's not your jam, you may want to skip to part two. For those who are still here, I hope you enjoy.

08:53.460 --> 09:14.060
Okay, guys. I need a video done by tomorrow. Does anyone have an idea right now? Anyone?

09:14.060 --> 09:17.100
Lenuski. I need an idea now, Lenuski.

09:17.100 --> 09:25.060
All right, yeah, that's cool. I have like a few dozen of them. All right, so because kale is like a superfood and we want to like lean into that element,

09:25.060 --> 09:30.820
since, you know, the product is kale, I feel like we could capitalize off of like the Marvel Cinematic Universe,

09:30.820 --> 09:37.820
so like induce like a lot of the super based puns and whatnot. And then that way we can appeal to all the children and their dads who never grew up.

09:37.820 --> 09:44.740
Do you seriously think we're going to do a video about kale?

09:44.740 --> 09:49.540
Will you hit me again if I say yes? Shut the fuck up and get out.

09:49.540 --> 09:57.540
What the fuck do you think you're doing? Get the fuck out, right? I need more ideas. Aubrey, give me an idea now.

09:57.540 --> 10:03.460
An idea for the video. Aubrey, idea now. Video idea.

10:03.460 --> 10:09.380
Okay, so hear me out. So the Minecraft dream, right? So he's green, like the product for the sponsor.

10:09.380 --> 10:15.060
So they kind of tie in together. Dream, green, kind of rhyme. So we got the green, green fans and the dream fans.

10:15.060 --> 10:19.980
You know, a lot of people like dream and the color green. So I think it ties in together nicely, wouldn't you say?

10:19.980 --> 10:27.380
Yeah, yeah. Do you think that's a good idea? It's a shit idea, right?

10:27.380 --> 10:33.900
Yeah. Do you want to say that idea again? I don't think I do.

10:33.900 --> 10:42.780
Okay, so I was thinking we could make a video on experimental cloud rapper, Blady, because he smokes weed all the time.

10:42.780 --> 10:48.500
I don't have a fucking clue what the fuck you're talking about. Does anyone know what he's talking about?

10:48.500 --> 10:55.900
It's Blady. Blade. Blade. Blade. It's a strange game, guys.

10:55.900 --> 11:03.380
Another idea, now. Alright, so we make a video on experimental cloud rapper Echo2K.

11:03.380 --> 11:10.860
Who the fuck is 2K Mecco? I don't want any more SoundCloud rappers from your mouth.

11:10.860 --> 11:25.380
We make a video on experimental hip hop.

11:25.380 --> 11:31.580
Coach, you better fucking have an idea. It's now you.

11:31.580 --> 11:37.380
Oh, make it good. Please make it good. A lot of the stuff we get is like shit that happens on Twitter.

11:37.380 --> 11:41.060
Like if someone getting canceled, maybe you could go with that. You know, people need that.

11:41.060 --> 11:50.100
And who should we cancel? Alright, hear me out. Maybe, maybe, maybe Tro gets into some shit and like,

11:50.100 --> 11:59.100
what's the contents around that? I feel like this is out of my, like, I might kill someone right now.

11:59.100 --> 12:05.100
I don't think you should go that far. We kind of need him. It's Tro. Okay.

12:05.100 --> 12:18.100
Hello? Yeah. Yeah, okay. Cold. Yeah. Basement.

12:18.100 --> 12:27.100
Okay. Kind of you. Thank you. You're off in there!

12:27.100 --> 12:35.100
Five minutes. Five minutes.

12:48.100 --> 13:17.100
You know what? I think I got it.

13:18.100 --> 13:28.100
Oh yeah? What about a four hour video on Frenemies?

13:28.100 --> 13:35.100

this is a region and age specific deal. For those living outside the US or under the age of 21, this does not apply to you.

14:10.100 --> 14:19.100
Aubrey, I'm sorry man. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. I love you.

14:19.100 --> 14:24.100
I love you too, Deckard. I'm sorry.

14:24.100 --> 14:31.100
2019 was a curious year for H3. Emerging from the drama of the previous 12 months, they had maintained a pretty strong

14:31.100 --> 14:36.100
upload schedule on both their podcast and their main channel. These videos certainly didn't evoke the energy of the

14:36.100 --> 14:41.100
main channel's supposed heyday, but the truth is that times have changed, and so have they. However, one video

14:41.100 --> 14:46.100
seemed to be a departure from not only their previous content, but in my opinion, their channel as a whole.

14:46.100 --> 14:51.100
Comedy has certainly evolved on YouTube, particularly in the last few years. There's a lot of talk about what jokes one

14:51.100 --> 14:55.100
can and can't make these days, and although there's definitely been a clamp down on certain creators in the

14:55.100 --> 15:01.100
commentary genre, there are still liberties you can take, and on the 8th of May 2019, I'd say H3H3 Productions

15:01.100 --> 15:05.100
exercised those with a video named Instagram vs Reality.

15:05.100 --> 15:11.100
Have you ever browsed Instagram and wondered why everyone looks so beautiful? Why does everyone have such a perfect life?

15:11.100 --> 15:16.100
Why is everyone having so much fun, has perfect skin, is always laughing and smiling?

15:16.100 --> 15:23.100
Why is my life so boring as I sit here in my underwear covered in breadcrumbs, sad and alone?

15:23.100 --> 15:28.100
Why? I'll tell you why. Because they're faking it. That is not you.

15:28.100 --> 15:32.100
The one on the left is on the beach, the one on the right just washed up on the beach.

15:32.100 --> 15:34.100
Oh damn, Tana's looking pretty good these days.

15:34.100 --> 15:35.100
Oh.

15:38.100 --> 15:42.100
I can't believe it's the same day. She looks like a Twinkie.

15:42.100 --> 15:47.100
Now as the title implies, it's about how many individuals tend to airbrush and edit their content to make it conform

15:47.100 --> 15:52.100
more with society's superficial standards surrounding beauty. On the surface, this is quite a progressive message,

15:52.100 --> 15:57.100
and there's nothing overtly wrong with calling that out. The video itself doesn't pull any punches when addressing

15:57.100 --> 16:03.100
these individuals who are thought to be participating in these shenanigans, one of those in particular being Trisha Paytas.

16:03.100 --> 16:09.100
This girl tried to use a face filter on Instagram and her phone blew up. There's another one of her.

16:09.100 --> 16:15.100
Ah, she is the best. Isn't she not the best? Would people even recognize her if they saw her on the street?

16:15.100 --> 16:21.100
I mean, she is unrecognizable. This is Coachella vs throwing down in the McDonald's parking lot at 3am.

16:21.100 --> 16:29.100
This is Coachella vs World Star Hip Hop. No, that cannot be the same person.

16:29.100 --> 16:33.100
Dude, Coachella vs open casket funeral.

16:33.100 --> 16:38.100
I have a lot of thoughts on this video as a whole, but I don't think it's necessary to the story we're constructing.

16:38.100 --> 16:43.100
All I will say is that at the time, regardless of Trisha's own reputation, this video did draw a bit of backlash.

16:43.100 --> 16:48.100
I think the main reason is because although it is completely fair to attack society's beauty standards and those who prop it up,

16:48.100 --> 16:52.100
attacking that person's appearance somewhat undermines the message in people's eyes,

16:52.100 --> 16:56.100
because then you yourself are using those standards as a stepping stone for your own point against it,

16:56.100 --> 16:58.100
which seems somewhat contradictory.

16:58.100 --> 17:02.100
How you interrupt the video ultimately comes down to what you think of these people's intent,

17:02.100 --> 17:07.100
whether they are just another victim of unattainable beauty standards or they're knowingly contributing to that toxicity.

17:07.100 --> 17:14.100
If we want commentary on Trisha's own intent, however, we are guaranteed to at least receive it from one source, Trisha themselves.

17:14.100 --> 17:21.100
Don't understand that there's so many more things that go into it than just stop eating, start exercising, stop being lazy.

17:21.100 --> 17:23.100
That is so much more to it.

17:23.100 --> 17:30.100
Oh my God, if people could even understand 10% of the mental struggles that a lot of overweight people go through.

17:30.100 --> 17:35.100
And I'm going to speak on myself, like, if you could even be inside this head for like a minute, a minute,

17:35.100 --> 17:41.100
and to see why I use food as like a coping mechanism, like, and it sucks.

17:41.100 --> 17:46.100
Now, Trisha had already responded once to Ethan's comments the previous year relating to society's beauty standards

17:46.100 --> 17:49.100
when H3 had made comments surrounding the model test holiday.

17:49.100 --> 17:55.100
It was clear that there was some disparity between the opinions each held about how they think the matter should be approached,

17:55.100 --> 17:59.100
but with the crosshairs shifted towards Trisha, the spotlight was firmly on them to respond.

17:59.100 --> 18:04.100
Trisha first put out a series of tweets that attacked H3H3 for their video, calling it predatory and harmful,

18:04.100 --> 18:07.100
and labelling Klein a disgusting piece of shysa.

18:07.100 --> 18:12.100
Nevertheless, of the belief that such tweets were not sufficient retribution for the Klein's misdemeanors,

18:12.100 --> 18:19.100
Trisha uploaded a video, further chastising H3H3 for their comments and depiction of sensitive issues that could impact many young girls growing up.

18:32.100 --> 18:36.100
In very typical Trisha fashion, it takes whatever valid criticism or responses could be made

18:36.100 --> 18:40.100
and blows them wildly out of proportion. Additionally, it meshes a variety of points together,

18:40.100 --> 18:44.100
including technical points about whether the photos Ethan compared were taken on the same day,

18:44.100 --> 18:48.100
or more emotional points about how this has affected them and other vulnerable individuals.

18:48.100 --> 18:55.100
You're not taking something from that day and showing it from a video clip in the same hair and makeup,

18:55.100 --> 19:02.100
you're taking all my photos he showed. One he showed a side by side was one I posted myself to show how different

19:02.100 --> 19:09.100
My whole point of that post was to be like, yes, I can be glam and I feel good about myself and also I can be like how I was looking and just like selfie down,

19:09.100 --> 19:16.100
like not the most attractive and I was doing that to show like, yes, to show what I guess he was trying to prove,

19:16.100 --> 19:22.100
but he did that in such a way of like, it was bullying. It really, really upset me. It really upset me.

19:22.100 --> 19:28.100
It's not that I don't understand how such comments could upset someone like Trisha if they feel as vulnerable about their appearance as they present.

19:28.100 --> 19:33.100
However, as a public figure, you're going to be the butt of these jokes, and Ethan's point, whether you agree with it or not,

19:33.100 --> 19:37.100
is that all of our appearances are flawed, and that trying to cover it up is only going to do more harm.

19:37.100 --> 19:41.100
This was a difference in perspective that neither side was going to compromise on,

19:41.100 --> 19:44.100
because they both seemed to believe that they were starting from the righteous premise.

19:44.100 --> 19:49.100
Trisha in empowering girls to post pictures of themselves online free from stigma from judgemental parties,

19:49.100 --> 19:54.100
and Ethan in tearing down the unrealistic thresholds of natural beauty pushed by many of these people.

19:54.100 --> 19:59.100
There was never going to be a compromise, yet it could have just ended here.

19:59.100 --> 20:03.100
Instead though, not happy with the response their video was receiving, Trisha pursued the feud online,

20:03.100 --> 20:07.100
once again escalating the comments, now directing them at Ethan's wife and child,

20:07.100 --> 20:10.100
providing some invaluable couples counselling on their marriage as well.

20:10.100 --> 20:15.100
Ethan, unfazed by these comments, continued to dunk on Trisha and the photoshop employing their content.

20:15.100 --> 20:20.100
At this point, Ethan took the W, because he avoided taking the comments to the personal level that Trisha did,

20:20.100 --> 20:25.100
and maintained his stance pretty staunchly. This is where the direct interaction appeared to end though,

20:25.100 --> 20:29.100
with Ethan delivering a final address to it on his podcast a few days later.

20:51.100 --> 20:56.100
First is, why are you on your kitchen floor? There's gotta be a better setting for this.

20:56.100 --> 21:00.100
Although brief, this exchange highlighted the contrasting dynamic shared between the two.

21:00.100 --> 21:05.100
Trisha, a person who really behaves on that emotional whim, the person who will readily bear their teeth at those

21:05.100 --> 21:08.100
that they wish to, and take their comments to places that many would consider beneath them.

21:08.100 --> 21:13.100
Ethan, on the other hand, may make provocative content from time to time, but also has a grasp on his own opinions,

21:13.100 --> 21:18.100
and in this case, maintain control of the conversation, not falling for the outrage base set by Trisha.

21:18.100 --> 21:23.100
Trisha pages said before that they will often chase the behaviour that guards them the most attention,

21:23.100 --> 21:28.100
but in this instance, they kinda hit that brick wall, where they didn't manage to elicit a rise out of their opponent.

21:28.100 --> 21:33.100
With this in mind, barely a couple days after their explosive rage, their tune changed, and they began posting somewhat

21:33.100 --> 21:37.100
strangely worded praise for Ethan, even asking if they could make an appearance on their podcast.

21:37.100 --> 21:42.100
As far as I'm aware, at this point they had not collaborated, so this tweet may have been a bit tongue in cheek,

21:42.100 --> 21:46.100
though I have to say I'm not sure where the tongue or the cheek are, but I digress.

21:46.100 --> 21:51.100
This was the first time that Trisha had signaled interest in collaborating on the podcast with H3H3,

21:51.100 --> 21:55.100
however this interest wasn't initially reciprocated by the clients who didn't respond to these tweets,

21:55.100 --> 22:00.100
and continued with their routine podcast schedule, seemingly paying no mind to Trisha and their antics.

22:00.100 --> 22:04.100
However, if anyone thought this quarrel in question was quite quelled, well, they were in for a little shock.

22:04.100 --> 22:10.100
That was an epic collab, I totally didn't anticipate it, like this came so out of left field,

22:10.100 --> 22:15.100
but I think I enjoyed it, I think deep down she enjoyed it as well.

22:15.100 --> 22:20.100
Something about Ethan's comedy and Trisha's desire for attention seemed to bring them together,

22:20.100 --> 22:25.100
and as the capers continued to increment, these characters were set on a collision course that could not be averted.

22:36.100 --> 22:41.100
Over the next few months, not too much of note happened, there was the occasional acknowledgement or mention of either party,

22:41.100 --> 22:47.100
but otherwise it seemed that this had mostly cooled, however all this changed when Trish decided to post a video coming out as transgender.

22:47.100 --> 22:54.100
So, in my head I feel like I'm a transgender female to male, but also like a drag queen.

22:54.100 --> 23:02.100
That's kind of how I've like rationalised it in my head, because like, okay, let me just tell you why I identify as a boy more so,

23:02.100 --> 23:10.100
and from an early age. I don't like to be centre of attention, except when I want to be centre of attention.

23:10.100 --> 23:16.100
Once again, I think we can keep this relatively brief, but this video was met with a lot of controversy for how it handled the subject matter

23:16.100 --> 23:20.100
and the communities that it references, regardless of whether Trisha truly was transgender.

23:20.100 --> 23:25.100
The day after, in light of the less than supportive response, Trisha posted an apology video,

23:25.100 --> 23:27.100
which unfortunately seems to have been lost to the sands of time.

23:27.100 --> 23:32.100
This was once again received fairly poorly, and provoked another response on the 8th Street Podcast.

23:32.100 --> 23:40.100
She just kind of describes like a lot of people, she says, I don't know, some days I don't wear makeup and I just wear comfy clothes.

23:40.100 --> 23:42.100
Trans, that means she's trans.

23:42.100 --> 23:49.100
I really relate to men, and I like to hang out with men more than women, and so therefore she thinks she's a guy.

23:49.100 --> 23:53.100
So take a guess what happens next, I'm telling you, it will shock you.

23:53.100 --> 24:01.100
Trisha took to Twitter to insult Ethan, however in a twist, this time posting some rather sensitive images that we shan't go into detail about.

24:01.100 --> 24:05.100
Ethan responds fairly unamused, and then Trisha brings up Ela like clockwork.

24:05.100 --> 24:08.100
Oh, and what would a situation be without a Trisha video?

24:08.100 --> 24:16.100
Apparently she came out recently as a trans male, so I guess she would know something about s**t.

24:16.100 --> 24:19.100
Although I bet you Trisha's got a large s**t that's bigger than my s**t.

24:19.100 --> 24:20.100
Hell yeah I do.

24:20.100 --> 24:24.100
She's got one of those weird girls, she's got like an engorged s**t.

24:25.100 --> 24:28.100
It is a meaty, I have a meaty ass s**t.

24:28.100 --> 24:35.100
It is so meaty and tight, it's like biting into an Arby's roast beef sandwich without the beef curtains.

24:35.100 --> 24:39.100
However this time, instead of the dispute dying a death like the previous altercation,

24:39.100 --> 24:45.100
Ethan responded to the Twitter publication of the video by inviting them on the podcast, if they were man enough.

24:45.100 --> 24:50.100
At first Trisha, seeming hesitant to commit, requests an advance payment of $18 million,

24:50.100 --> 24:53.100
a fairly regular sum for most H3 guests, I'm sure.

24:53.100 --> 24:56.100
However, Ethan calls Trisha on their bluff, stating that they'll do it for free.

24:56.100 --> 25:03.100
Chief negotiator Trisha then makes a minor amendment to the condition, stating that they may appear if Ethan apologizes for all his dumbass trolling,

25:03.100 --> 25:06.100
something which Trisha is obviously a stranger to.

25:06.100 --> 25:11.100
A few days later, on the 16th of October, Ethan uploads another video which includes a parody apology to Trisha,

25:11.100 --> 25:16.100
mocking their often melodramatic setup, providing the implication that negotiations had perhaps broken down.

25:17.100 --> 25:25.100
I wanted to basically apologize to Trisha Paytas, who is such a sweet, genuine person,

25:25.100 --> 25:33.100
and I just really, like, I wanted to first of all apologize for saying that she looked like she was at an open casket funeral,

25:33.100 --> 25:36.100
like she was the corpse inside of a casket.

25:36.100 --> 25:41.100
That's not true, that's just not what I meant at all, you're so beautiful, you're such a queen.

25:41.100 --> 25:49.100
And I also wanted to apologize for saying that you have, like, a 5 to 10 inch engorged clit that's bigger than my dick.

25:49.100 --> 25:55.100
I mean, that would basically make you a guy, that would basically mean you had a penis,

25:55.100 --> 26:02.100
and, well, I guess I'm kind of confused because you said you're trans, I don't know, I just am sorry, I don't want to offend you.

26:03.100 --> 26:13.100
I'm sorry for saying that you're not trans, man, even though you have, like, cup f jugs that are always on display.

26:13.100 --> 26:19.100
With the unpredictability of Trisha, it would be normal to assume that this interaction would fizzle out like many others had.

26:19.100 --> 26:24.100
However, in a surprise turn of events, approximately a fortnight later, a photo was posted on Twitter

26:24.100 --> 26:29.100
that showed the two parties together alongside a link to Trisha's debut on the H3 podcast.

26:29.100 --> 26:34.100
Well, first of all, Trisha Paytas is here, are we here to squash the beef or roast the beef?

26:34.100 --> 26:42.100
Ooh, I would love to squash it, but I like you guys talking about me, so maybe we'll roast more.

26:42.100 --> 26:44.100
That's what I figured, thank you for saying that.

26:44.100 --> 26:48.100
It's now a half of the two parties addressing and appearing to mostly settle their differences.

26:48.100 --> 26:54.100
On the one hand, Trisha handles themselves pretty well, in fact responding to certain questions with a degree of eloquence not typically associated with them,

26:54.100 --> 27:00.100
such as certain gender-related queries, where their responses actually add a lot of nuance to their prior content on the matter.

27:00.100 --> 27:06.100
A lot of people are transphobic, me coming out transgender is not gonna help my dating life, it's not gonna, why would I put that on myself?

27:06.100 --> 27:12.100
I'm trying to date, I'm trying to get married, why would I put that out there just so people can look up that I'm a transgender if I truly don't believe that?

27:12.100 --> 27:17.100
It always fascinates me how the internet can be surprisingly hostile to those who may just be expressing confusion,

27:17.100 --> 27:22.100
and although Trisha did make some insensitive comments, their confusion was nothing to write off on their own basis.

27:22.100 --> 27:25.100
In fact, I think many only responded the way they did because it's Trisha.

27:25.100 --> 27:29.100
The podcast allowed them to make their own defence, and I think that was a positive thing.

27:29.100 --> 27:33.100
On the other hand though, it kinda reminds me of James Merritt's interview with Nikocado Avocado.

27:33.100 --> 27:39.100
You appear to have two parties engaging in casual conversation, however when you know both parties relatively well,

27:39.100 --> 27:43.100
particularly Trisha, you begin to pick up on certain details that others may overlook.

27:43.100 --> 28:01.100
In this part Trisha says they go to Israel all the time, which just isn't true.

28:01.100 --> 28:07.100
It's such a trivial detail to lie about, so trivial that you don't feel like it's worth even pulling them up on it.

28:07.100 --> 28:11.100
When it comes to other points though, Trisha was caught with their trousers down.

28:12.100 --> 28:15.100
I'm not trying to expose anything that's private, but...

28:15.100 --> 28:17.100
It's all demonetised.

28:17.100 --> 28:24.100
Hold on, hold on, hold on. Where is it? Apology, and then it's coming up regarding my...

28:24.100 --> 28:31.100
I am transgender, 3 million views, green icon, monetised, and I'm gonna tell you exactly how much money she made.

28:31.100 --> 28:34.100
She made $8,000 for that video!

28:34.100 --> 28:39.100
It's a fascinating watch in many ways because it outlined that character that Trisha Paytas has cultivated,

28:39.100 --> 28:42.100
and places it in an environment where it can receive direct scrutiny.

28:42.100 --> 28:48.100
I do want to save some analysis for the end of the video, but it certainly illuminates how differently Trisha views the consequence

28:48.100 --> 28:51.100
of their own language and behaviour in comparison to a lot of other creators.

28:51.100 --> 28:56.100
However, this podcast appearance wouldn't be possible without two people, namely Ethan and Hila.

28:57.100 --> 29:01.100
I mean, clearly not all men are violent, I mean, like that.

29:01.100 --> 29:02.100
But some are.

29:02.100 --> 29:08.100
And a lot are cheaters, a lot are perverts, a lot of underage girls, like, yeah.

29:08.100 --> 29:16.100
So do you, are you ever afraid that it might be that your choices drive these bad characters into your life?

29:16.100 --> 29:18.100
My choices is how?

29:18.100 --> 29:20.100
And men. The men you're attracted to.

29:20.100 --> 29:23.100
I feel like I date everybody, like anybody who wants to date me, I'll date them.

29:23.100 --> 29:27.100
So I feel like I don't, I'm not picky, I just date whoever wants to date me.

29:27.100 --> 29:33.100
So maybe the image you put out to the world attracts the wrong kind of guy.

29:33.100 --> 29:36.100
I've heard that. Oh my god, this is like therapy now.

29:36.100 --> 29:37.100
Oh my god, it's so deep.

29:37.100 --> 29:40.100
You are like a dad, even though you're only 34, you're like a 45 year old dad.

29:40.100 --> 29:41.100
I am a dad.

29:41.100 --> 29:46.100
Ethan has the energy of an accommodating yet critical host, and although patronising and slightly presumptive at points,

29:46.100 --> 29:49.100
he doesn't just endlessly grill Trisha like some probably would.

29:49.100 --> 29:53.100
He lets them say their peace and challenges when he feels necessary, catching them out a few times.

29:53.100 --> 29:57.100
At the same time, there's this still somewhat standoffish nature between the two parties,

29:57.100 --> 30:01.100
particularly with Ela's presence, who still seems somewhat sceptical towards Trisha,

30:01.100 --> 30:04.100
and their nature to fluctuate between flirtatious and insulting towards Ethan.

30:04.100 --> 30:07.100
I love that we're on a three-way date right now, we're like eating and talking.

30:07.100 --> 30:11.100
We're like coffee. Ethan is the worst, I have to say that.

30:11.100 --> 30:13.100
You're kind of just the worst. I think Ela...

30:13.100 --> 30:18.100
Wait, hold on, so you hated me, you came in liking me more, but now you hate me again.

30:18.100 --> 30:22.100
It's a mesmerising experience, these two internet veterans dissecting an individual

30:22.100 --> 30:27.100
who has in many ways occupied the spotlight for so long, yet seldom been understood by those attacking them.

30:27.100 --> 30:31.100
By the end of the podcast, although it felt like any dispute had been placated,

30:31.100 --> 30:34.100
you weren't really sure if there were seeds for a future relationship.

30:34.100 --> 30:39.100
Some tension in the air still lingered, and with everything in mind, that was to be expected.

30:39.100 --> 30:45.100
But somewhere deep down, there was the potential for something truly great, and I think people knew that.

30:48.100 --> 30:53.100
As I mentioned at the start, Klein had been involved in a fair bit of drama relating to how he handled himself on the podcast,

30:53.100 --> 30:55.100
but also how he interacted with guests.

30:55.100 --> 30:58.100
And he also had a zillion kids, so I mean, yeah.

30:58.100 --> 30:59.100
Really? How many siblings do you have?

30:59.100 --> 31:02.100
I don't know, dude. The internet's too fucking weird to give out all that information.

31:02.100 --> 31:06.100
Oh, you don't even want to say how many, because you're afraid that it will not compromise your privacy.

31:06.100 --> 31:09.100
Yeah, by all means, keep talking about it. Is there anybody who can cut this out?

31:09.100 --> 31:10.100
I'm honest, dude.

31:10.100 --> 31:11.100
Seriously?

31:11.100 --> 31:13.100
Yeah, no, dude. Yeah, there's fucking lunatics out there.

31:13.100 --> 31:14.100
Okay.

31:14.100 --> 31:15.100
Well...

31:15.100 --> 31:16.100
Off the air, off the air, I'll tell you.

31:16.100 --> 31:17.100
Alright.

31:18.100 --> 31:19.100
Jeez.

31:19.100 --> 31:25.100
There were a lot of theories as to why this was, but many at the time were under the impression that he was not a naturally talented podcast host,

31:25.100 --> 31:28.100
particularly when he appeared with certain people, and that's completely fine.

31:28.100 --> 31:35.100
The transfer from video content that can be scripted and edited to a podcast where you really have to devote your full attention towards each and every moment

31:35.100 --> 31:37.100
can be an exceptionally difficult one.

31:37.100 --> 31:44.100
However, sometimes it's about who you're doing the podcast with, and Trisha Paytas was someone that you never ran out of questions for,

31:44.100 --> 31:49.100
and if you're an inquisitive person like Klein is in a way, then it was quite easy to maintain and engage in conversation,

31:49.100 --> 31:52.100
even if it does seem more like a case study at points.

31:52.100 --> 31:56.100
It doesn't taste like anything to me. The squid I got is like a transparent squid, so it just doesn't taste like anything.

31:56.100 --> 32:01.100
It was a wild goal. I mean, I used to eat like goldfish as a kid, I used to like swallow goldfish, so I don't think you're supposed to do that either.

32:01.100 --> 32:03.100
But I would just eat the fish out of the bowl.

32:03.100 --> 32:04.100
Why would you do that?

32:04.100 --> 32:07.100
I don't know, I thought it was honestly food. I was young, I was like five.

32:07.100 --> 32:13.100
For a while it seemed like this was the most confab we were going to see, as the two turned back towards their own ventures over the following months,

32:13.100 --> 32:18.100
until the start of 2020 that is, when they returned to the podcast for another session of antics.

32:18.100 --> 32:19.100
I love this.

32:19.100 --> 32:21.100
So it is like a throuple.

32:21.100 --> 32:24.100
It's not a throuple. It's definitely not a throuple.

32:24.100 --> 32:26.100
I think of it like parents, but now I think of it like a throuple.

32:26.100 --> 32:28.100
I feel like this because me and Hila are getting along good.

32:28.100 --> 32:30.100
Please don't think of it as a throuple.

32:30.100 --> 32:32.100
It's like a little date right now.

32:32.100 --> 32:34.100
Definitely not a date.

32:34.100 --> 32:40.100
One of the constant struggles that Trisha has been quite open about on her channel is their often fruitless endeavour to find a relationship,

32:40.100 --> 32:48.100
and during their appearances on the two episodes of the podcast, Trisha had a nature to make certain comments that seemed to seek validation for intimacy with those they were around.

32:48.100 --> 32:55.100
These include the numerous rather pointed flirtatious remarks towards Ethan, and referring to the podcast's collective presence as a throuple.

32:55.100 --> 33:00.100
Ethan and Hila weren't completely sold in this dynamic though, and had their own plans for Trisha going forward.

33:00.100 --> 33:05.100
The year prior, the clients had conducted a dating game of sorts with an individual known as Ian the Intern,

33:05.100 --> 33:09.100
where they would peruse dating profiles and attempt to set him up with some lovely ladies.

33:09.100 --> 33:16.100
They compared this setup to the show The Bachelor, a show that I am unfortunately completely oblivious to, and have very little interest in learning about.

33:16.100 --> 33:22.100
Unfortunately, Ian seemed to undermine the show when he messaged one of the participants, and then decided that he didn't want her to come on the show.

33:22.100 --> 33:27.100
Nonetheless, the concept was a hit with the audience, so clearly the clients thought they would bring it back for season two,

33:27.100 --> 33:31.100
this time branding it as The Bachelorette with You Know Who in the starring role.

33:31.100 --> 33:42.100
I brought Trisha back here, and the reason that Trisha's joining us today is, as you all know, Ian's had a season of The Bachelor, with an H3 instead of a...

33:42.100 --> 33:45.100
It's a capital H in a three, Bachelor.

33:45.100 --> 33:49.100
And so Ian actually found true love on his season.

33:49.100 --> 33:56.100
We had some ups and downs, we had some controversies, but in the end, Ian has been dating a girl for how long, Ian?

33:57.100 --> 34:00.100
For about, since last September around there, October.

34:00.100 --> 34:02.100
Since last September, Hila came through.

34:02.100 --> 34:03.100
Wow.

34:03.100 --> 34:05.100
So he's in love.

34:05.100 --> 34:06.100
And he met up on the show?

34:06.100 --> 34:08.100
Yes. So the show worked.

34:08.100 --> 34:10.100
Wow, I didn't know this.

34:10.100 --> 34:11.100
The show worked.

34:11.100 --> 34:12.100
Oh, I had no idea this was a thing.

34:12.100 --> 34:24.100
And so we take this very seriously, love is very important to me and Hila, and our community, and we thought, Trisha Paytas, now that's the next season of The Bachelorette.

34:24.100 --> 34:29.100
With so many eligible young gentlemen falling at their feet, it was clear that Trisha was spoiled for choice.

34:29.100 --> 34:32.100
However, Trisha seemed to have eyes for one person in particular.

34:32.100 --> 34:39.100
I thought, I don't know if I can say this, and you can cut it if I'm not supposed to say this, but I was low-key hoping,

34:39.100 --> 34:44.100
because originally I was expecting the idea to come on as a contestant, and Hila's brother is going to be The Bachelor,

34:44.100 --> 34:46.100
and then I thought maybe he would apply to be on My Bachelorette.

34:46.100 --> 34:48.100
He was supposed to, I don't know what happened.

34:48.100 --> 34:50.100
He said that he wanted to apply.

34:50.100 --> 34:51.100
I found it on Instagram, it's fine.

34:51.100 --> 34:53.100
We could take a last minute submission.

34:53.100 --> 34:56.100
He said he wanted to, I think he's honestly super busy.

34:56.100 --> 35:02.100
He's like a fucking mega, hard, he's like a, he should make time though, right?

35:02.100 --> 35:03.100
He should make time.

35:03.100 --> 35:04.100
He should make time.

35:04.100 --> 35:06.100
He looks so hot, I was like low-key impressed.

35:06.100 --> 35:07.100
I was like, holy shit.

35:07.100 --> 35:09.100
Like he's strikingly hot.

35:09.100 --> 35:10.100
Okay, we'll make sure.

35:10.100 --> 35:11.100
This is Moses Ackman.

35:11.100 --> 35:17.100
He's an Israeli-born artist and architect who is relevant enough to have his own Wikipedia page, so that must mean something.

35:17.100 --> 35:22.100
He is best known for his work Faces of Water which uses an artistic technique involving liquid iron,

35:22.100 --> 35:28.100
all in all he seems like a reasonably talented artist who possesses some prestige in his field of operation.

35:28.100 --> 35:34.100
However, he is also the brother of Hila Klein, and a Bachelorette entrant that Trisha seemed quite drawn towards.

35:34.100 --> 35:39.100
Trisha had been known to have a somewhat strange interest towards humans of Jewish background,

35:39.100 --> 35:44.100
and therefore it was probably not particularly surprising given their reputation that they liked Moses.

35:44.100 --> 35:49.100
However, it was still a strange dynamic, and one that Hila at least didn't seem too eager to foster.

36:14.100 --> 36:16.100
We'll get- we'll get Moses in here too.

36:16.100 --> 36:16.600
Now-

36:16.600 --> 36:17.100
Moses!

36:17.100 --> 36:18.100
That's his name, yeah.

36:18.100 --> 36:20.100
Fuck that name, that's crazy.

36:20.100 --> 36:22.100
You better fucking Moses, holy shit.

36:22.100 --> 36:23.100
And he looks like Jesus.

36:23.100 --> 36:24.100
The hell of a thing.

36:24.100 --> 36:26.100
Like, write the three commandments on my pussy.

36:27.100 --> 36:28.100
Sorry, what was that?

36:28.100 --> 36:29.100
What did she say?

36:29.100 --> 36:30.100
I don't know.

36:31.100 --> 36:32.100
Like, nevermind.

36:32.100 --> 36:34.100
Nevermind, it's fine.

36:34.100 --> 36:38.100
His name is Moses, he might spread your red seed.

36:38.100 --> 36:39.100
Ooh!

36:39.100 --> 36:40.100
Is he into that?

36:40.100 --> 36:42.100
Yeah, he'll eat you out when you're on your period.

36:42.100 --> 36:43.100
He's into that.

36:43.100 --> 36:46.100
I don't want to see him right now, I wouldn't want to deal with him today.

36:46.100 --> 36:52.100
The rules of The Bachelorette were set so that Trisha was advised against contacting any of the participants privately,

36:52.100 --> 36:54.100
particularly with the season one incident in mind.

36:54.100 --> 36:58.100
However, if they were to do so, there would be full disclosure with Ethan and Hila.

36:58.100 --> 37:02.100
It seemed there was some understanding between everyone that would help make the show a success.

37:02.100 --> 37:04.100
But then it happened.

37:04.100 --> 37:05.100
Yes, lockdown.

37:05.100 --> 37:07.100
Caused by our good old pathogenic friend.

37:08.100 --> 37:13.100
And the H3 podcast was put on hold while they worked out a new arrangement compatible with the then present restrictions.

37:13.100 --> 37:18.100
However, even if the H3 podcast was on hold, there was no stopping the Trisha show,

37:18.100 --> 37:21.100
who decided that they had to take matters into their own hands.

37:21.100 --> 37:26.100
And just over a month after the launch of The Bachelorette season two, it came to an abrupt end.

37:26.100 --> 37:33.100
On her Instagram stories, in bed with somebody, and we see a hand, and I'm like...

37:34.100 --> 37:37.100
Again, cryptic. I think that's his, I think it's his arm.

37:38.100 --> 37:39.100
It looks like it.

37:39.100 --> 37:40.100
It could be.

37:40.100 --> 37:42.100
It definitely is.

37:42.100 --> 37:46.100
But the evidence piles on as we continue forth here.

37:46.100 --> 37:50.100
She posts pictures of, she says, quarantine date night.

37:52.100 --> 37:53.100
Okay, now.

37:53.100 --> 37:54.100
Okay.

37:54.100 --> 37:55.100
So let's just, so okay.

37:55.100 --> 38:00.100
This is a separate day, so whoever this is, has come back to her house, a date night.

38:00.100 --> 38:03.100
She calls it a date night, and whoever it is brought dinner.

38:03.100 --> 38:07.100
Yes, on March the 23rd, Trisha posted pictures of them with Moses,

38:07.100 --> 38:11.100
with the somewhat oxymoronic statement that they were social distancing together.

38:11.100 --> 38:15.100
Ethan did not see the funny side of this, but Trisha continued to openly flaunt their rendezvous,

38:15.100 --> 38:18.100
much to the dismay of Ackman's sister and her husband,

38:18.100 --> 38:21.100
with them asserting that Trisha had ruined the show with their mischief.

38:21.100 --> 38:26.100
I have to tell you that I don't know what he's up to.

38:26.100 --> 38:27.100
Right.

38:27.100 --> 38:29.100
This isn't some inside joke.

38:29.100 --> 38:32.100
Look at the way he's looking at, so this is what Trisha posted.

38:32.100 --> 38:33.100
Look at his face.

38:33.100 --> 38:34.100
What is he doing?

38:34.100 --> 38:36.100
It's like he's goofing on us.

38:36.100 --> 38:37.100
Like, look.

38:37.100 --> 38:38.100
Well, it's hard to tell.

38:38.100 --> 38:40.100
Nice place, by the way, for Trisha.

38:40.100 --> 38:41.100
Nice view.

38:41.100 --> 38:42.100
You can't tell.

38:42.100 --> 38:43.100
Hollywood Hills, by the way.

38:43.100 --> 38:45.100
It could be just him smiling.

38:48.100 --> 38:49.100
Bro, what are you doing?

38:49.100 --> 38:51.100
What are you doing?

38:51.100 --> 38:53.100
You know what's my biggest fear right now?

38:53.100 --> 38:55.100
Is that this actually becomes serious.

38:55.100 --> 39:01.100
So both of these people promise me to keep bit 100 billion with me.

39:01.100 --> 39:02.100
Yes, they promise.

39:02.100 --> 39:04.100
Like, I'm most disappointed in your brother.

39:04.100 --> 39:05.100
Trisha, whatever.

39:05.100 --> 39:08.100
You know, we serve at her pleasure.

39:08.100 --> 39:11.100
I mean, you don't know which personality you're showing up from which day.

39:11.100 --> 39:13.100
I'm just happy when she comes in.

39:13.100 --> 39:19.100
I mean, I expected her to work within the guidelines, too.

39:19.100 --> 39:23.100
Your brother, though, is on our side, and now I don't know whose side he's on.

39:23.100 --> 39:26.100
Needless to say, I can understand why the two were frustrated.

39:26.100 --> 39:29.100
Notably, given that this was the second time this had happened.

39:29.100 --> 39:32.100
However, when you're dealing with love, you can't really put a contract on it.

39:32.100 --> 39:38.100
And this was going to be inevitable with something as loosely structured as The Bachelorette, and with someone like Trisha.

39:38.100 --> 39:43.100
This was just not a great idea from the start, and the circumstances only exacerbated that.

39:43.100 --> 39:48.100
Although in many ways Trisha was the perfect podcast guest, their appeal was also your Achilles heel.

39:48.100 --> 39:51.100
They were not a person who was going to play by your rules.

39:51.100 --> 39:56.100
So when you impose these sorts of expectations on them, then you need to manage your own expectations as well.

39:56.100 --> 40:02.100
That doesn't mean you can't find it frustrating, but it's somewhat inevitable when you deal with someone who you know is notoriously unpredictable.

40:02.100 --> 40:07.100
H3 needed to think about this, but in the meantime, chaos reigned once more.

40:22.100 --> 40:28.100
Although in a way it felt like Trisha was closer to the Klein's than they had ever been,

40:28.100 --> 40:34.100
this only really intensified the tension between the creators, who openly criticised each other over the coming months.

40:34.100 --> 40:40.100
In the meantime, to cement their commitment to the relationship, Trisha began learning Hebrew, and yes, uploading videos on the matter.

40:40.100 --> 40:46.100
When the relationship was good, it was great, and the Klein's were trying to break an inseparable bond between soulmates,

40:46.100 --> 40:51.100
and when the relationship wasn't working out, the Klein's were the cause of its demise. They really couldn't win.

41:17.100 --> 41:21.100
Ethan and Hila seem to display some semblance of disapproval,

41:21.100 --> 41:27.100
though I think there was a point where you have to begrudgingly accept that there is very little you can do to control a person like Trisha.

41:27.100 --> 41:33.100
Trisha is someone who will put their own impulsive desires first, and will only play your game when they have a chance of winning,

41:33.100 --> 41:36.100
and as Trisha said themselves, they won.

41:36.100 --> 41:42.100
Of course so many people are like Trisha, you're not Jewish, and to that I say I was not born Jewish,

41:42.100 --> 41:47.100
but I tend to gravitate towards Jewish people in my life, that have taught me a lot.

41:47.100 --> 41:52.100
Once more, it went rather quiet for the next few months as the stalemates seemed to persist between the parties.

41:52.100 --> 41:55.100
However, with everybody involved still one degree away from each other,

41:55.100 --> 41:59.100
there was that sense that the dating show was far from the last we'd see of them together.

41:59.100 --> 42:04.100
However, they'd really need a catalyst to bring them together. Who or what on earth could do that?

42:04.100 --> 42:09.100
But the internet, there's nothing going on on the internet, so I decided to have you on anyways.

42:09.100 --> 42:11.100
Sounds good to me.

42:11.100 --> 42:15.100
Allow me to introduce two new guests to this very fun little house party.

42:15.100 --> 42:18.100
Gabbie Hanna and our beloved Keemstar.

42:18.100 --> 42:23.100
Gabbie Hanna is no stranger to controversy herself, and is a common talking boy for many commentators.

42:23.100 --> 42:28.100
Her feud with Trisha Paytas is no less contentious, with Trisha accusing Gabbie of slander and harassment,

42:28.100 --> 42:34.100
even threatening to take a restraining order out on her after she allegedly told Trisha's boyfriend Jason Nash that Trisha had herpes,

42:34.100 --> 42:39.100
as explained in their now deleted video, Why I Don't Trust Gabbie Hanna.

42:39.100 --> 42:43.100
When me and Jason started hooking up in 2017, I did a video called YouTubers I've Hooked Up With.

42:43.100 --> 42:47.100
She, by the clues, guessed that I was hooking up with Jason. I was.

42:47.100 --> 42:52.100
She texted Jason, and she told Jason, or I guess, I don't know if she texted him or told him in person,

42:52.100 --> 42:58.100
but basically she told him, hey, be careful, Trisha has herpes and you're sleeping with her and blah blah blah.

42:58.100 --> 43:14.100
Gabbie, have we slept together? Did I show you my STD results? Are you my doctor? Did you swab my vagina?

43:14.100 --> 43:18.100
Gabbie did not debate that she had told Nash about the possibility of herpes,

43:18.100 --> 43:21.100
and testified that she was merely warning a friend about certain health risks,

43:21.100 --> 43:26.100
however she challenged the claims of harassment and stated Trisha was attempting to blackmail their mutual friends,

43:26.100 --> 43:29.100
and since then any spirit of friendliness has been extinguished,

43:29.100 --> 43:32.100
with Trisha making further videos asking Gabbie to leave them alone.

43:32.100 --> 43:37.100
But it likely they're not chums, though some may be forgiven for thinking it's just another Pater's drama,

43:37.100 --> 43:39.100
and there's nothing particularly exceptional about it.

43:39.100 --> 43:45.100
Keemstar on the other hand, well honestly I would describe Ethan's attitude towards Keem quite exceptional,

43:45.100 --> 43:46.100
at least for Ethan.

43:47.100 --> 43:52.100
Keem, uh, clownstar, I know you're watching this because you're obsessed with me,

43:52.100 --> 43:58.100
you're on every word and your blood is boiling, you're thinking to yourself, how am I going to destroy him?

43:58.100 --> 44:01.100
How am I going to make a Twitter rant and then find some shit?

44:01.100 --> 44:04.100
This guy literally got it, I don't need to keep going on about Keemstar,

44:04.100 --> 44:11.100
it's not the first time he's just made actually slanderous lies about me, but that is that.

44:11.100 --> 44:17.100
Ethan and Keem have a long history on YouTube, mostly hostile, with the occasional ceasefire when a greater cause united them.

44:17.100 --> 44:23.100
But at the start of 2020, H3 released three videos that sought to malign Keemstar from the platform once and for all,

44:23.100 --> 44:26.100
even criticizing those who willingly associated with him.

44:26.100 --> 44:30.100
Keemstar's got a bottle of G-Fuel somewhere in his house that's actually a horcrux.

44:30.100 --> 44:32.100
How is G-Fuel still sponsored by this guy by the way?

44:32.100 --> 44:37.100

Keemstar responded to these videos with his own perspective, framing Ethan as a dishonest opportunist hack and all-round hypocrite

44:46.100 --> 44:49.100
who didn't really care about the issues that he was speaking about.

44:49.100 --> 44:52.100
There are a lot of valid opinions that one can have about this mess of a drama,

44:52.100 --> 44:56.100
however one thing I would probably say is that if you were familiar with either of the creators,

44:56.100 --> 44:59.100
it was unlikely to change your opinion on them.

44:59.100 --> 45:04.100
At its core, the videos were a showcase of how much these guys truly detested each other,

45:04.100 --> 45:09.100
and this continued over the next few months, with nobody really emerging as a clear victor.

45:09.100 --> 45:11.100
So what is the relevance to these two people?

45:11.100 --> 45:15.100
Well you see, in September, bored as hell at the fact that there was no news,

45:15.100 --> 45:20.100
Keemstar decided to invite Gabbie Hanna onto Drama Alert to talk about writing a diss track on Trish,

45:20.100 --> 45:23.100
which as you can assume went down like a lead balloon with our good friend,

45:23.100 --> 45:28.100
who sent multiple tweets to Keemstar for platforming those who they had deemed pieces of f***,

45:28.100 --> 45:31.100
even going as far to imply that their life could be on the line over this matter.

45:31.100 --> 45:36.100
Hey Keemstar, from one fat f*** to another, get your f*** together.

45:36.100 --> 45:41.100
Don't blame Gabbie Hanna for my death because she's mentally ill, you have no idea why I had to hire 24 hour security,

45:41.100 --> 45:47.100
you sick f***, you think bringing up drama is all fun and games until you're egging on a mentally ill person,

45:47.100 --> 45:52.100
saying I'm star d***, saying I'm insatiation, I'm f***ing scared for my life, you dumb son of a b****.

45:52.100 --> 45:57.100
Now it's hard to really establish a motive for why exactly Keemstar decided to have Gabbie come on Drama Alert,

45:57.100 --> 46:03.100
maybe he was genuinely bored, but Ethan appeared to back Trish's response, while continuing to speak ill of Keem.

46:03.100 --> 46:06.100
Keemstar noticed these and subsequently went off on Twitter about it himself.

46:06.100 --> 46:12.100
After this went nowhere, Keemstar reached out to Ethan offering a truce, framing it as the smartest thing to do.

46:12.100 --> 46:19.100
In the coming months, more people were educated and they realised, oh wait, Keemstar's right, H3H3's a bad guy,

46:19.100 --> 46:27.100
and now you're losing, and I'm winning, but the truth of the matter is that there's no winner, right?

46:27.100 --> 46:34.100
We both lost, the lesser of the loser is not the winner. This is stupid.

46:34.100 --> 46:39.100
And we're both going to continue to lose the more we fight.

46:39.100 --> 46:43.100
And the smart thing to do is to make peace.

46:43.100 --> 46:50.100
I'm inviting you, I'm Moms Basement, my podcast, to attempt to talk this out and to make peace,

46:50.100 --> 46:56.100
if you don't want to come on my show, I'll go on your show, but we need to make peace.

46:56.100 --> 47:04.100
This is affecting our companies, our careers, and not really my mental health,

47:04.100 --> 47:11.100
but you said that it affected your mental health, so it's time to make peace.

47:11.100 --> 47:14.100
Hypothetically, you can understand why Keemstar wanted to do this,

47:14.100 --> 47:18.100
but logically it was something that H3 was very unlikely to agree to.

47:18.100 --> 47:21.100
Maybe Keem knew that, and he wanted to appear to be the reasonable party,

47:21.100 --> 47:25.100
but Ethan wasn't one to negotiate with someone he wanted to truly present as a terrible person,

47:25.100 --> 47:29.100
given the lengths that he had gone to emphasise how bad a person Keemstar was,

47:29.100 --> 47:34.100
and still was at that point, he had more to lose by patching up the drama with our bearded buddy.

47:34.100 --> 47:37.100
However, what happened next seemed to cement his position.

47:37.100 --> 47:43.100
Ethan- I've been wanting to make a podcast with another comedian for a while, and I don't mean that to compliment you.

47:43.100 --> 47:49.100
I think I mean two big personalities, and in my mind when I kept trying to think of people to do it with,

47:49.100 --> 47:56.100
I always thought, you know, me and Trisha have a really funny chemistry on all of your visits,

47:56.100 --> 48:03.100
and I thought, well, you know, fuck it, let's just do it like that, let's do it live, fuck it!

48:03.100 --> 48:05.100
Trisha- Oh, but this isn't live though.

48:05.100 --> 48:06.100
Ethan- No, it's just still.

48:06.100 --> 48:12.100
On September the 15th, Trisha made their return to the H3 podcast, however this wasn't just any old appearance,

48:12.100 --> 48:15.100
and the way this was presented and discussed, this was the start of a new era,

48:15.100 --> 48:21.100
a series featuring both Ethan and Trisha, where they discuss various dramatic and miscellaneous content,

48:21.100 --> 48:25.100
whatever took their interest, based on that core appeal that had worked so naturally before.

48:25.100 --> 48:29.100
Although many hypothesise this had been brought on by their mutual dislike of Keem,

48:29.100 --> 48:32.100
they refrain from mentioning him until the end of the show.

48:33.100 --> 48:36.100
Ethan- We can talk about Keemstar, whatever you want.

48:36.100 --> 48:40.100
Trisha- Love you, much drama alert? Should we shout it out, promo?

48:40.100 --> 48:41.100
Ethan- Drama alert?

48:41.100 --> 48:42.100
Trisha- Yeah, what up?

48:42.100 --> 48:44.100
Ethan- You wanna give a shout out to drama alert?

48:44.100 --> 48:47.100
Trisha- Nothing but love, we're all peace and positive here.

48:47.100 --> 48:48.100
Ethan- Yeah, Keemstar's the best.

48:48.100 --> 48:53.100
It was welcomed with opened arms by their audience, but with circumstances and characters in mind,

48:53.100 --> 48:56.100
I'm sure many wondered if it was going to survive beyond a couple episodes.

48:56.100 --> 49:00.100
Ethan and Trisha's working relationship often seemed borne out of a mutual cause,

49:00.100 --> 49:03.100
and it's not that a cause like that can't be worthwhile,

49:03.100 --> 49:06.100
but the question is what happens when that cause is ultimately fulfilled,

49:06.100 --> 49:08.100
like it was with The Bachelorette?

49:08.100 --> 49:11.100
If this podcast was the result of other factors like Keemstar,

49:11.100 --> 49:14.100
what happens when the influence of those factors inevitably lessens?

49:14.100 --> 49:17.100
There had to be something deeper between Trisha and Ethan,

49:17.100 --> 49:19.100
but could they ever find it?

49:19.100 --> 49:23.100
Well, let's talk about the centrepiece of Ethan and Trisha's tumultuous relationship.

49:31.100 --> 49:35.100
In a way, Frenemies was a concept that was constructed of Trisha and Ethan's established rapport.

49:35.100 --> 49:38.100
The fact that on one hand they'd had friendly conversations,

49:38.100 --> 49:40.100
they'd had productive discourse on certain matters,

49:40.100 --> 49:44.100
but they'd also had their fair share of drama and fallings out after they had seemingly record-styled.

49:44.100 --> 49:47.100
The question on many people's minds was how do you keep a podcast going

49:47.100 --> 49:50.100
with two people who may hate each other on a certain day,

49:50.100 --> 49:52.100
who may not talk for months?

49:52.100 --> 49:55.100
Well, money maybe, but even then, if you're not really committed to something,

49:55.100 --> 49:57.100
it tends to shift.

49:57.100 --> 50:01.100
Even then, if you're not really committed to something, it tends to show.

50:23.100 --> 50:26.100
However, in the first episode, there clearly was a commitment involved.

50:26.100 --> 50:30.100
They even had their impersonalised set to contrast between the two creators,

50:30.100 --> 50:34.100
Ethan on that brooding dark side, and Trisha with their pink-spirited jollity.

50:34.100 --> 50:37.100
I mean, to be honest, that's not an accurate representation of their style,

50:37.100 --> 50:41.100
but I suppose that is the sort of energy they tend to emanate at least.

50:41.100 --> 50:46.100
In that introduction, Ethan emphasised that these two were drawn together for that unique chemistry,

50:46.100 --> 50:49.100
seemingly debunking the idea that this was a tactical decision on his part.

50:49.100 --> 50:52.100
There was acknowledgement that this could go pear-shaped very quickly,

50:52.100 --> 50:55.100
but both seemed to have an understanding of the potential outcomes,

50:55.100 --> 50:58.100
intrepidly embracing them, and from the first minute of the first episode,

50:58.100 --> 51:02.100
that quirky chemistry that everyone seemed to identify was on exhibit.

51:02.100 --> 51:26.100
In a way, though, this time it was intended.

51:26.100 --> 51:29.100
It's not like Trisha didn't mean what they had said in the past.

51:29.100 --> 51:34.100
It meant that this environment was actively fostered in acknowledgement of its subsequent public release.

51:34.100 --> 51:39.100
A friend of his episodes is basically a compilation of the conversations you have with your friend.

51:39.100 --> 51:42.100
In all honesty, you'd be afraid to ever provide a public platform.

51:42.100 --> 51:47.100
But Trisha was that friend who already had the platform, so in a way, people almost felt more permitting,

51:47.100 --> 51:49.100
because it wasn't like they had much to gain from it.

51:49.100 --> 51:55.100
In return, Ethan Handel gallantly found an aspect for his podcast that he had been desperately missing in the past.

51:55.100 --> 51:57.100
That raw chemistry.

51:57.100 --> 52:25.100
He'd finally shown his critics that he could actually do something that many doubted he could.

52:25.100 --> 52:31.100
I think the problem with his previous intues was that Ethan and Hila aren't the best at starting conversation,

52:31.100 --> 52:35.100
and when dealing with more stoic guests, this tended to lead to some awkward interactions.

52:35.100 --> 52:38.100
Trisha was probably the most world-curious guest they had,

52:38.100 --> 52:42.100
and Trisha always provided Ethan with at least ten zany comments to find one response to,

52:42.100 --> 52:44.100
which Ethan could always do.

52:44.100 --> 52:49.100
The highs yielded quality banter, excellent repartee, and chemistry for the ages.

52:49.100 --> 52:52.100
However, with the sunshine came the rain.

53:02.100 --> 53:05.100
Surprisingly, the first four episodes went without major incident.

53:05.100 --> 53:11.100
However, the fifth build as a Halloween special is where the greasy wheels appear to detach from the ramshackle machine.

53:11.100 --> 53:15.100
Trisha has a habit of going nuclear rather quickly, and I'll discuss why in a moment,

53:15.100 --> 53:22.100
but whenever they feel slightly attacked, they seem to fight back with a thousand times the ferocity of that which was initially launched on them.

53:22.100 --> 53:29.100
In this case, during a discussion on transparency, Trisha brings up the subject of Ethan's substance abuse to prove that he's not as open as he claims.

53:29.100 --> 53:34.100
Ethan, feeling blindsided by this comment, accuses Trisha of weaponizing his problems against him.

53:34.100 --> 53:37.100
This strikes a nerve with Trisha, and it quickly goes downhill from there.

53:46.100 --> 53:48.100
I've never said anything like that to him.

53:48.100 --> 53:50.100
I've seen your group chats. I literally see his phone.

53:50.100 --> 53:54.100
Well, you bragging about looking through his phone isn't exactly the best look.

53:54.100 --> 53:56.100
I'm not bragging about it. I'm stating something because, once again, I'm open.

53:56.100 --> 53:59.100
Well, I've never said anything like that. I'm trying to resolve this because-

53:59.100 --> 54:02.100
The more we talk about it, the worse it's going to be. Like, good luck. Honestly, good luck.

54:02.100 --> 54:06.100
Thanks for having me on five episodes. Love it. It was so much fun, and I'm over it.

54:06.100 --> 54:10.100
Good luck, and I'm sorry about your family situation. I'm sorry about your situation.

54:10.100 --> 54:11.100
I know you're miserable.

54:11.100 --> 54:12.100
No, it's not true.

54:12.100 --> 54:14.100
You are. I can tell. I can tell, and it's sadness.

54:14.100 --> 54:16.100
And I see you when I was around your family that you have sadness in you, and it's sad.

54:16.100 --> 54:17.100
Okay.

54:17.100 --> 54:19.100
And that's why you're so mean to people on the internet, and I get it,

54:19.100 --> 54:22.100
but also don't take it out on people and call them crazy and shit.

54:22.100 --> 54:27.100
Well, we're going out on a high note here, folks, all for your viewing pleasure.

54:27.100 --> 54:30.100
Just wire me for this later, and we'll talk never.

54:30.100 --> 54:35.100
Because I just- I hate people just like- that are you. You're the person I hate in this world.

54:35.100 --> 54:36.100
Really?

54:36.100 --> 54:38.100
That's so just offensive, but they do nothing wrong.

54:38.100 --> 54:41.100
And when people are provoked, oh, they're crazy, calling girls crazy and stuff like that.

54:41.100 --> 54:45.100
It's like- but taking no accountability, no responsibility.

54:45.100 --> 54:47.100
You think everything's just an attack against you, everyone's against Ethan.

54:47.100 --> 54:49.100
Like, oh my gosh, I'm always right.

54:49.100 --> 54:52.100
It's like, ugh, you and Jax won't serve each other, so.

54:52.100 --> 54:55.100
Jax? I can't believe you're going after Jax. He's such a sweet guy.

54:55.100 --> 54:57.100
Bye, love you.

54:57.100 --> 54:58.100
All right, Trisha.

54:58.100 --> 55:00.100
All right, bye. Thanks for the great episode.

55:00.100 --> 55:04.100
It's quite a sight to behold Ethan perched there in his Uncle Fester costume.

55:04.100 --> 55:08.100
But visuals aside, this did spawn a situation that clearly troubled those involved.

55:08.100 --> 55:10.100
For some, this would be drama, this would be funny.

55:10.100 --> 55:15.100
But for the podcast, this was the surfacing of a problem that has been present with Trisha for years,

55:15.100 --> 55:18.100
and it definitely brought into question whether this dynamic was healthy.

55:20.100 --> 55:23.100
I'm gonna try to do a post-mortem on this.

55:25.100 --> 55:27.100
I don't know, maybe she's just having a bad day.

55:27.100 --> 55:31.100
I haven't spoken about it too much yet, and I don't want to speak about it too much in general,

55:31.100 --> 55:35.100
but Trisha has been quite open about their struggles with Borderline Personality Disorder,

55:35.100 --> 55:42.100
a condition that alongside other symptoms can cause intense emotional instability and impulsivity in individuals affected by it.

55:42.100 --> 55:45.100
This has obviously been demonstrated in certain scenes of the podcast,

55:45.100 --> 55:50.100
and when you see Trisha storm off, some would draw that what you're actually witnessing is an episode of BPD,

55:50.100 --> 55:54.100
and question whether it's actually ethical that we're even witnessing what's going on.

55:54.100 --> 55:59.100
Everyone accepted that this time around these sorts of interactions were a very real possibility,

55:59.100 --> 56:03.100
and in an attempt to preserve that raw nature to make sure that we're receiving the full picture,

56:03.100 --> 56:05.100
even the ugliest parts are left in.

56:05.100 --> 56:09.100
Yet, although that rawness was in itself an appeal for many viewers,

56:09.100 --> 56:14.100
it also led some to question whether this was really fair given Trisha's own personality disorders,

56:14.100 --> 56:18.100
given that these outbursts were thought to be a symptom of the condition in question.

56:18.100 --> 56:23.100
It's a commonplace discussion because on one hand, you never want to rob an individual of their agency,

56:23.100 --> 56:28.100
and let me make it crystal clear, Trisha consented to be on the podcast from its inception to its cessation,

56:28.100 --> 56:31.100
however at the same time when you're walking around topics that could trigger someone,

56:31.100 --> 56:35.100
when you're on a podcast that actively acknowledges that it could become nasty pretty quickly,

56:35.100 --> 56:39.100
you also have to make sure you're not just carelessly exploiting that.

56:39.100 --> 56:43.100
Although I think anyone would be pressed to say that Ethan ever went out of his way to torment Trisha,

56:43.100 --> 56:49.100
also doing nothing about that sort of dysfunctional environment could be seen as passively allowing that toxicity to thrive,

56:49.100 --> 56:54.100
which although spectacular points, doesn't really do much good for you, Trisha, or anyone else who works on the podcast,

56:54.100 --> 56:59.100
and the moment you stop taking those outbursts seriously, then you risk enabling that behaviour as well.

56:59.100 --> 57:05.100
This was an emergent problem that was going to cause a very imminent demise if something wasn't done about it.

57:08.100 --> 57:14.100
If these were normal podcast episodes, then these disruptions would have likely been the end of Trisha and Ethan's friendship

57:14.100 --> 57:18.100
for at least another few months, and at first it did seem like Trisha was not going to be returning to the podcast,

57:18.100 --> 57:22.100
however given that they had this partnership going, this was something that worked to an extent,

57:22.100 --> 57:26.100
I think it gave both parties a greater impetus to try and maintain it.

57:26.100 --> 57:29.100
At the same time, doing nothing wasn't the best option either, and in the episode following,

57:29.100 --> 57:35.100
the tension between the two was still palpable, with Trisha reluctant to open up to Ethan again after their heated exchange.

57:43.100 --> 57:49.100
Although there was progress throughout the episode, it felt like something more needed to be done to keep this alliance healthy and productive,

57:49.100 --> 57:52.100
and by the next show it seemed like Ethan had found the solution.

57:58.100 --> 58:03.100
Allow me to introduce you to this man then, his name is Drew Pinsky, but is more informally known as Dr Drew.

58:03.100 --> 58:09.100
He has a renowned media personality and internist, which basically means that you specialise in treating a variety of elements

58:09.100 --> 58:14.100
of the body without the need for surgery. Some people use the term physician interchangeably with it,

58:14.100 --> 58:16.100
in case you're more familiar with that term.

58:16.100 --> 58:21.100
Dr Drew is recognised for a plethora of programs, most notably Loveline, a phone-in show where he would provide

58:21.100 --> 58:25.100
relationship, medical, and miscellaneous advice to listeners and callers alike.

58:25.100 --> 58:31.100
At its peak, it was incredibly popular, and Dr Drew was generally perceived as offering pretty decent guidance to those who requested it.

58:31.100 --> 58:36.100
Since his discontinuation in 2016, he's continued to make appearances on a variety of broadcasts,

58:36.100 --> 58:42.100
and has established himself online and on YouTube. On the surface, it seemed like he was a man with fairly solid credentials,

58:42.100 --> 58:48.100
so with all this in mind, he was the sort of person who may be able to resolve, or at least ease the conflicts between Trish and Ethan.

58:48.100 --> 58:54.100
So, on the 27th October, he was brought on for enemies to help address that rift that had grown between the two hosts.

58:54.100 --> 58:56.100
Would he be up to the test?

59:03.100 --> 59:08.100
On one hand, the discussion appeared to go pretty well. Drew showed an interest in Trisha that allowed them to open up,

59:08.100 --> 59:12.100
and they appeared to make progress on perhaps patching up old wounds. There's discourse on drug abuse,

59:12.100 --> 59:18.100
and as an expert on that front, Dr Drew really comes into his element. In many ways, I can see that this was useful for the two.

59:18.100 --> 59:23.100
On the other hand, there is a glaring issue. Dr Drew is not a therapist, and although he's knowledgeable,

59:23.100 --> 59:27.100
he lacks the tact that is typically aspired for by those in that profession.

59:27.100 --> 59:34.100
I feel like we have amazing chemistry, and I see the goodness in you, and I know that you're always fighting to bring that out,

59:34.100 --> 59:40.100
more than when you get upset, or you do this and that, and the stuff you regret. I don't ever see that as who you are,

59:40.100 --> 59:43.100
I know who you are, and I love that person as a friend of mine.

59:43.100 --> 59:45.100
Okay, well thank you.

59:45.100 --> 59:50.100
I said it was Ethan's idea to bring Dr Drew on because he seems to take credit for bringing him on at the start of the video.

59:50.100 --> 59:55.100
However, if this hadn't been explained, you would be forgiven for thinking that this individual was drafted in by Trisha.

59:55.100 --> 59:58.100
I don't want to do that, I don't want to hurt anyone, even in my relationship now.

59:58.100 --> 01:00:02.100
I am trying to sabotage it to not make it last, because I don't want to be harmful to anybody,

01:00:02.100 --> 01:00:05.100
and I am, I'm dangerous to myself, I'm dangerous to other people, and it's bad.

01:00:05.100 --> 01:00:10.100
Okay, so Ethan, can you see how when you say something like this is a weaponized, you're attacking me,

01:00:10.100 --> 01:00:14.100
that's tough territory for her right now. You got it?

01:00:14.100 --> 01:00:15.100
Yeah, no.

01:00:15.100 --> 01:00:16.100
You understand? Okay.

01:00:16.100 --> 01:00:17.100
Yeah, for sure.

01:00:17.100 --> 01:00:18.100
So here's the deal.

01:00:18.100 --> 01:00:22.100
Now I don't want to necessarily place all the responsibility onto Plinsky immediately,

01:00:22.100 --> 01:00:29.100
because I accept that there was the possibility that Ethan briefed the Doctor in a specific way that would make him more drawn to sympathy on Trisha's end.

01:00:29.100 --> 01:00:34.100
However, even some of the comments that he makes seem to be slanted or strangely passive aggressive.

01:00:34.100 --> 01:00:36.100
Oh damn, Tana's looking pretty good.

01:00:36.100 --> 01:00:37.100
Okay, stop it, stop it.

01:00:37.100 --> 01:00:38.100
Okay.

01:00:38.100 --> 01:00:39.100
Oh my goodness.

01:00:39.100 --> 01:00:44.100
So, so, Immerse, so, I didn't know her at all, I didn't even know her name, and then I did that.

01:00:44.100 --> 01:00:47.100
You're one of those people on the internet, my man.

01:00:47.100 --> 01:00:48.100
Wait, me?

01:00:48.100 --> 01:00:49.100
No, no, he is.

01:00:49.100 --> 01:00:50.100
Oh, thank you.

01:00:51.100 --> 01:00:53.100
Feeling free to attack people he doesn't know.

01:00:53.100 --> 01:00:54.100
Exactly.

01:00:54.100 --> 01:00:56.100
Wait, what do you mean one of those people?

01:00:57.100 --> 01:01:05.100
One of those people that I'm swatting off every day, that doesn't understand that people that are out there on the internet are actually people.

01:01:05.100 --> 01:01:11.100
I will preface by saying that I'm not a therapist, but I have experienced therapy, and I'd like to think I know a thing or two about working with people,

01:01:11.100 --> 01:01:16.100
and one of the things that you should be doing as a therapist is helping someone open up.

01:01:16.100 --> 01:01:21.100
Immediately antagonising someone publicly, even in semi-jest, is not going to do that.

01:01:21.100 --> 01:01:28.100
It's not the only snarky remark he makes, and it really feels out of place for what he's been asked to do, however my issues don't end there.

01:01:28.100 --> 01:01:34.100
One of the endless problems with Dr Drew are these closed statements that fail to explore a person's feelings.

01:01:34.100 --> 01:01:40.100
I really don't want to go too much on a tangent here, but it's really important that a patient can find closure in their own judgement,

01:01:40.100 --> 01:01:42.100
even if you've directed them there in a way.

01:01:42.100 --> 01:01:48.100
The problem is, when you end the discussion of a particular topic prematurely, even if you think you've wrapped it up,

01:01:48.100 --> 01:01:53.100
the discomfort in that person will linger, whether it's discomfort with your judgement, or doubt of their own judgement.

01:01:53.100 --> 01:01:57.100
It's not a healthy place to leave someone, particularly if you directly conflicted with their own opinion.

01:01:57.100 --> 01:02:00.100
Drew, you could tell me if I need to apologise or not on this one.

01:02:00.100 --> 01:02:01.100
She looks like a Twinkie!

01:02:01.100 --> 01:02:03.100
Alright, this is what Bonnicon was promoted as.

01:02:03.100 --> 01:02:05.100
Apology warranted?

01:02:05.100 --> 01:02:06.100
Um...

01:02:06.100 --> 01:02:08.100
The yellow outfit was the...

01:02:08.100 --> 01:02:13.100
In a weird way, that's making too much of nothing, which is, guess what, photographs lie.

01:02:13.100 --> 01:02:18.100
And if we don't know that by now, then caveat emptor, you know what I mean?

01:02:18.100 --> 01:02:22.100
And I think, I don't know that woman, I mean if you feel like you hurt her feelings, you should apologise.

01:02:22.100 --> 01:02:24.100
You don't want to hurt her, I'd assume.

01:02:24.100 --> 01:02:26.100
I don't think I've hurt her feelings, I think you just...

01:02:26.100 --> 01:02:28.100
Yeah, I don't think she cares.

01:02:28.100 --> 01:02:35.100
Right, so I don't think it's a big deal, but there is something to be learned from that, which is that photos lie, videos lie too.

01:02:35.100 --> 01:02:42.100
Dr Drew kinda establishes himself as an authority in providing opinions on topics throughout the episode, and that's not really right.

01:02:42.100 --> 01:02:47.100
Ethan doesn't handle this the best admittedly by thrusting the emphasis on whether he should apologise to Pinsky,

01:02:47.100 --> 01:02:50.100
but at that point you as a therapist need to step in and say,

01:02:50.100 --> 01:02:57.100
hey, it's not my job to arbitrate these specific situations, it's my job to help you arbitrate them yourselves.

01:02:57.100 --> 01:03:01.100
Nobody needs to know Dr Drew's opinion on this subject to find resolution.

01:03:01.100 --> 01:03:04.100
This isn't to say that he can't express feelings about certain matters,

01:03:04.100 --> 01:03:07.100
and in many places he speaks with power to subjects that are helpful,

01:03:07.100 --> 01:03:11.100
but he often seems too driven to make a judgement before all the facts are on the table.

01:03:11.100 --> 01:03:12.100
Case in points?

01:03:12.100 --> 01:03:16.100
Okay, there was an issue, this is a whole different issue, but I had an issue with my boyfriend, which is his brother-in-law,

01:03:16.100 --> 01:03:20.100
with private DMs, he exposed all these private things, so there's no boundaries when it comes to me.

01:03:20.100 --> 01:03:21.100
No, I get it.

01:03:21.100 --> 01:03:25.100
But as soon as I bring up something private with him, then what triggered me was his like,

01:03:25.100 --> 01:03:27.100
whoa, you're weaponising, oh my god, you're being abused and crazy now.

01:03:27.100 --> 01:03:29.100
Yeah, I never weaponised anything against him.

01:03:29.100 --> 01:03:32.100
No, no, no, you told me I was weaponising when all of a sudden I thought that was our relationship,

01:03:32.100 --> 01:03:35.100
just saying whatever, just everything's out in the open, so I was like, okay.

01:03:35.100 --> 01:03:36.100
That's what I thought, so she's confused.

01:03:36.100 --> 01:03:40.100
It confuses her to not know where you're supposed to draw the line, right?

01:03:40.100 --> 01:03:41.100
Yeah, I was shocked.

01:03:41.100 --> 01:03:47.100
Okay, but don't you see why me now would never say anything like that to you in private?

01:03:47.100 --> 01:03:51.100
I can see that, but the same thing, you read private text messages I sent only to you.

01:03:51.100 --> 01:03:59.100
Hold on, hold on, Ethan, Ethan, not saying things in private to her because of that does not make you an open person, right?

01:03:59.100 --> 01:04:04.100
You can't say, I'm totally open about everything, but I can't trust you, so I'm not going to be open.

01:04:04.100 --> 01:04:09.100
It's okay, you don't have to tell everybody everything, but don't claim that you're wide open and telling everybody everything.

01:04:09.100 --> 01:04:12.100
She's the one that's really wide open, too much, too much so, right?

01:04:12.100 --> 01:04:14.100
I agree, I do agree with that.

01:04:14.100 --> 01:04:18.100
Ethan has expressed a direct disagreement with what Trisha's recalling.

01:04:18.100 --> 01:04:24.100
At that point, you have to unravel that, otherwise you can't be certain that the image that is being projected is an accurate one.

01:04:24.100 --> 01:04:28.100
Instead, Dr Drew takes Trisha's word as gospel and moves in with his thoughts,

01:04:28.100 --> 01:04:32.100
but without addressing the fact that this judgement may be based on presuppositions that aren't exactly true,

01:04:32.100 --> 01:04:36.100
there's no guaranteed validity, and once again, no guaranteed closure.

01:04:36.100 --> 01:04:43.100
If there's a sensitive personal subject that had previously been publicly revealed, that's very different to one being exposed for the first time.

01:04:43.100 --> 01:04:47.100
In a way, Dr Drew is somewhat disadvantaged in judging these situations.

01:04:47.100 --> 01:04:53.100
He is unfamiliar with the podcast, he clearly hadn't watched the situation transpire as he is approaching it with fresh eyes.

01:04:53.100 --> 01:04:58.100
However, when you do that, you also need to know that someone's word may not be completely accurate,

01:04:58.100 --> 01:05:02.100
and if you assume it to be right, you risk never bridging that divide.

01:05:06.100 --> 01:05:12.100
Oh, and I've gotten help for the past year because I had two mental hospital stays where I was put on a 5150.

01:05:12.100 --> 01:05:15.100
So like, I go into these, like...

01:05:15.100 --> 01:05:16.100
These states.

01:05:16.100 --> 01:05:20.100
Yeah, like, it's like a blackout where I'm like, not that person.

01:05:20.100 --> 01:05:21.100
Yes.

01:05:21.100 --> 01:05:24.100
And like, that was the first time that happened, so now that that's out there on the internet,

01:05:24.100 --> 01:05:29.100
like everyone thinks that's just me, that I just like, abuse people, and it's like, it's never been that far.

01:05:29.100 --> 01:05:33.100
It's difficult when dealing with Trisha because you don't want to risk triggering an episode,

01:05:33.100 --> 01:05:38.100
but at the same time, you also want to be careful when dealing with someone whose narratives can be somewhat unreliable.

01:05:38.100 --> 01:05:43.100
You could be providing life-changing advice, but it wouldn't matter if it's under false pretenses.

01:05:43.100 --> 01:05:49.100
The presentation of this is couples counselling, but by the end it has really transformed into Trisha's counselling,

01:05:49.100 --> 01:05:53.100
with the occasional input from Klein, and maybe it makes sense given that Trisha has more issues,

01:05:53.100 --> 01:05:58.100
but when you're trying to repair that bond, there has to be some semblance that you're keeping a couple on even footing.

01:05:58.100 --> 01:06:00.100
They have to be in this together.

01:06:01.100 --> 01:06:04.100
Yeah, I can see why your relationships don't work out.

01:06:04.100 --> 01:06:06.100
I can see why you've been with the same person for 12 years.

01:06:06.100 --> 01:06:07.100
Thank you.

01:06:07.100 --> 01:06:10.100
You have no other options, and quite frankly, I don't blame you.

01:06:10.100 --> 01:06:13.100
Ethan may have had problems in how he interacted with Trisha.

01:06:13.100 --> 01:06:16.100
He knew that friendlies needed conflict, but it's a fine line to walk,

01:06:16.100 --> 01:06:20.100
and it's fair to say that at points he may have crossed a few sensitive boundaries.

01:06:20.100 --> 01:06:23.100
However, it was a shared change that needed to be undertaken,

01:06:23.100 --> 01:06:26.100
and even with the understanding that Trisha was working on themself,

01:06:26.100 --> 01:06:30.100
they still had a commitment to the podcast as well if they wanted to maintain it.

01:06:30.100 --> 01:06:33.100
Nonetheless, towards the end we appear to be moving in that direction,

01:06:33.100 --> 01:06:36.100
as there seem to be heartfelt comments from both co-hosts,

01:06:36.100 --> 01:06:40.100
expressing remorse for previous hostility, and expressing desire to build from that.

01:06:40.100 --> 01:06:42.100
I do, I feel horrible.

01:06:42.100 --> 01:06:46.100
I do apologise for being so nasty, like from the pill thing,

01:06:46.100 --> 01:06:50.100
because I know how that feels, and I apologise for trying to be tough and badass,

01:06:50.100 --> 01:06:52.100
and talking about Ela and everything.

01:06:52.100 --> 01:06:54.100
I always feel bad, like I feel bad about it,

01:06:54.100 --> 01:06:57.100
when it's not in a joking mode, when it wasn't, when you triggered me, I felt bad.

01:06:57.100 --> 01:06:59.100
When I was like, good luck, trying to get your wife pregnant,

01:06:59.100 --> 01:07:01.100
it was just a mean thing, I don't know what it was, and I'm sorry,

01:07:01.100 --> 01:07:03.100
and I feel bad, like that's not me.

01:07:03.100 --> 01:07:07.100
It's not the last time you'll do it.

01:07:07.100 --> 01:07:12.100
At the end, you may have been given the impression that this was actually a proper reconciliation,

01:07:12.100 --> 01:07:16.100
with Klein and Paytas thanking Dr Drew, committing to another episode with him in the future,

01:07:16.100 --> 01:07:19.100
and the podcast ending on a considerably triumphant note,

01:07:19.100 --> 01:07:21.100
but it all felt a bit hollow to me.

01:07:21.100 --> 01:07:23.100
Maybe that's with the context of where we are right now,

01:07:23.100 --> 01:07:26.100
but even then it's very difficult to take anything at face value,

01:07:26.100 --> 01:07:31.100
because even becoming invested in this progression requires an assurance that we wouldn't end back in this place

01:07:31.100 --> 01:07:33.100
that caused this episode to occur,

01:07:33.100 --> 01:07:36.100
and I wouldn't think that everyone was prepared to invest themselves in that,

01:07:36.100 --> 01:07:38.100
especially given the difficulty of acquiring the truth,

01:07:38.100 --> 01:07:41.100
and how Trisha even presented that in the podcast.

01:07:41.100 --> 01:07:43.100
It felt like we could end up here again,

01:07:43.100 --> 01:07:45.100
and lo and behold, we did.

01:07:45.100 --> 01:07:47.100
Yeah, Hila was watching and she said,

01:07:47.100 --> 01:07:50.100
why didn't you tell her that she had powder on her lips?

01:07:50.100 --> 01:07:54.100
I was like, I mean, I was staring at it the whole time.

01:07:54.100 --> 01:07:56.100
You're so mean.

01:07:56.100 --> 01:07:59.100
On my screen it just looked like a glint on your lip gloss.

01:07:59.100 --> 01:08:01.100
In the beginning I said you have powder on your lips,

01:08:01.100 --> 01:08:04.100
but then you didn't get it all off, and the whole episode I was just staring at.

01:08:04.100 --> 01:08:06.100
Can we have Hila as a guest on our podcast?

01:08:06.100 --> 01:08:08.100
No. She's busy. Don't talk about Hila.

01:08:08.100 --> 01:08:11.100
We're cutting this part out. She doesn't want to be talked about.

01:08:11.100 --> 01:08:13.100
Are you fucking serious?

01:08:13.100 --> 01:08:15.100
We have to cut this.

01:08:15.100 --> 01:08:17.100
That's fucking crazy.

01:08:17.100 --> 01:08:19.100
Like, what's even the point in the one we talked about?

01:08:19.100 --> 01:08:21.100
Because she doesn't like that you're always bringing her up

01:08:21.100 --> 01:08:23.100
and saying how she doesn't like you and all this shit

01:08:23.100 --> 01:08:25.100
because it's not true and she finds it annoying

01:08:25.100 --> 01:08:29.100
because she doesn't want people to start thinking that she doesn't actually like you.

01:08:29.100 --> 01:08:31.100
Well, she doesn't. Whatever. It's so fake,

01:08:31.100 --> 01:08:33.100
and that's why H3 is not what it was,

01:08:33.100 --> 01:08:35.100
because you guys are fake as fuck and cut things out.

01:08:35.100 --> 01:08:37.100
Okay, you're like on a thing now.

01:08:37.100 --> 01:08:39.100
I'm not. I just think it's so fake. It's so bullshit.

01:08:39.100 --> 01:08:41.100
It's like, oh, let's talk about everything.

01:08:41.100 --> 01:08:43.100
Ask not to be included.

01:08:43.100 --> 01:08:45.100
And I'm respecting her request.

01:08:45.100 --> 01:08:47.100
Ben, I'm not talking about anything personal anymore.

01:08:47.100 --> 01:08:49.100
I won't talk about Moses. I won't talk about me.

01:08:49.100 --> 01:08:51.100
Like, it's just, whatever. Who cares?

01:08:51.100 --> 01:08:53.100
Should we...

01:08:53.100 --> 01:08:55.100
Cut it. I didn't cut all of it. I literally couldn't kill us.

01:08:55.100 --> 01:08:57.100
It was approaching Christmas when another frack has occurred,

01:08:57.100 --> 01:09:01.100
this time over the topic of Hila not wishing to be spoken about on the podcast.

01:09:01.100 --> 01:09:05.100
Both involved seem to try and fail to de-escalate the situation at different points,

01:09:05.100 --> 01:09:07.100
causing discussion to rapidly intensify,

01:09:07.100 --> 01:09:09.100
culminating in Trisha storming out

01:09:09.100 --> 01:09:11.100
and making some exceptionally strong comments.

01:09:39.100 --> 01:10:03.100
Over the next few days, Trisha put out videos elucidating on their feelings.

01:10:03.100 --> 01:10:05.100
These videos were long-winded and not the clearest.

01:10:05.100 --> 01:10:07.100
Some of them are very angry, some of them are sad,

01:10:07.100 --> 01:10:09.100
but they all highlighted one thing,

01:10:09.100 --> 01:10:11.100
that Trisha was struggling with their identity,

01:10:11.100 --> 01:10:13.100
and often didn't know what portrait they wanted portrayed on the podcast,

01:10:13.100 --> 01:10:17.100
yet they didn't feel like they had a choice in many capacities.

01:10:17.100 --> 01:10:23.100
I don't like pushing myself for the sake of drama for the show.

01:10:23.100 --> 01:10:25.100
I don't mind it to be.

01:10:25.100 --> 01:10:29.100
I don't mind, obviously, I love Ethan and find Ethan funny.

01:10:29.100 --> 01:10:31.100
I like our dynamic.

01:10:31.100 --> 01:10:35.100
You know, it's very similar to when I was friends with David Dobrik.

01:10:35.100 --> 01:10:39.100
I liked the poking.

01:10:39.100 --> 01:10:41.100
I think it's fun.

01:10:41.100 --> 01:10:43.100
I think it's entertaining, obviously.

01:10:43.100 --> 01:10:45.100
People find it entertaining.

01:10:45.100 --> 01:10:47.100
And I like it.

01:10:47.100 --> 01:10:51.100
I find it somewhat stimulating to have an opponent, if you will.

01:10:51.100 --> 01:10:57.100
But I do think Ethan pushes me to get this reaction of me walking out.

01:10:57.100 --> 01:10:59.100
Me walking out is something I don't like.

01:10:59.100 --> 01:11:01.100
This seemingly caused a lot of anguish within them,

01:11:01.100 --> 01:11:03.100
and in many ways it looked like the only solution was to quit,

01:11:03.100 --> 01:11:05.100
with Trisha even acknowledging it as a viable option.

01:11:05.100 --> 01:11:07.100
However, after the success of Dr Drew's first appearance,

01:11:07.100 --> 01:11:11.100
our expert was once more called in to settle their feud,

01:11:11.100 --> 01:11:13.100
this time alongside Dr Mark Young,

01:11:13.100 --> 01:11:15.100
an expert on entertainment and business.

01:11:15.100 --> 01:11:19.100
Well, Dr Drew was already pre-booked for this appearance,

01:11:19.100 --> 01:11:21.100
it just coincided with the pair falling out,

01:11:21.100 --> 01:11:23.100
so I guess it all fell into place.

01:11:23.100 --> 01:11:27.100
However, this episode was definitely more contentious than the last.

01:11:27.100 --> 01:11:29.100
There are obviously tonal issues that I've previously discussed,

01:11:29.100 --> 01:11:33.100
but many of people's problems come down to the core message of the episode.

01:11:33.100 --> 01:11:35.100
It's two hours, and I'm not going to be talking about all of it.

01:11:35.100 --> 01:11:37.100
Watch it yourself if you dare.

01:11:59.100 --> 01:12:05.100
Arriving a wedge between Moses and his family.

01:12:05.100 --> 01:12:07.100
There's one more piece that I think is important.

01:12:07.100 --> 01:12:11.100
When I ask Moses, when Hila asks Moses about it,

01:12:11.100 --> 01:12:15.100
Moses says, I didn't say that.

01:12:15.100 --> 01:12:17.100
Yeah, that's actually not important.

01:12:17.100 --> 01:12:21.100
The main question posed is how these two should be dealing with Trisha's outburst.

01:12:21.100 --> 01:12:25.100
Now on Trisha's front this is a difficult question for sure,

01:12:25.100 --> 01:12:28.100
but this is why you need someone who's actually an expert in this field.

01:12:28.100 --> 01:12:32.100
Dr. Drew for all his abilities and qualifications is not,

01:12:32.100 --> 01:12:34.100
so the focus often turns to Ethan,

01:12:34.100 --> 01:12:37.100
where the discourse quickly becomes focused around how he should deal with Trisha,

01:12:37.100 --> 01:12:40.100
but Dr. Drew's advice on this front also falls short.

01:12:40.100 --> 01:12:41.100
You just will.

01:12:41.100 --> 01:12:44.100
And Ethan, your job is to not respond to splitting.

01:12:44.100 --> 01:12:50.100
Yeah, but she's driving, but I can't, if she's my wife.

01:12:50.100 --> 01:12:53.100
I gotta get on your case for this one.

01:12:53.100 --> 01:12:56.100
You are allowing the wedge to be put in the place.

01:12:56.100 --> 01:12:58.100
She is doing what she does.

01:12:58.100 --> 01:13:02.100
She is doing her splitting thing, and your job is to go, uh-huh.

01:13:02.100 --> 01:13:08.100
You know also, Trisha, that one of your things is unregulated aggression, hostility.

01:13:08.100 --> 01:13:10.100
Once it gets going, it goes, right?

01:13:10.100 --> 01:13:11.100
Yeah.

01:13:11.100 --> 01:13:14.100
And then Ethan somehow can't handle that when that happens.

01:13:14.100 --> 01:13:15.100
I can handle it.

01:13:15.100 --> 01:13:19.100
Well, no, you escalate it, as opposed to just containing it.

01:13:19.100 --> 01:13:21.100
You gotta watch the clip.

01:13:21.100 --> 01:13:25.100
The whole mantra of merely moving on from inflammatory behaviour seems rather disagreeable.

01:13:25.100 --> 01:13:30.100
Maybe if they were both 10, it would be some wise old parenting adage, but they're not.

01:13:30.100 --> 01:13:33.100
You are allowed to assert boundaries at this stage of a supposed friendship.

01:13:33.100 --> 01:13:38.100
It's almost like Drew believes that any other action other than rolling over is innately provocative,

01:13:38.100 --> 01:13:40.100
and that's just not true.

01:13:40.100 --> 01:13:44.100
As a matter of fact, you could well be enabling toxic behaviour by not at least challenging it.

01:13:44.100 --> 01:13:48.100
Personality disorders may make you more predisposed to certain behaviours,

01:13:48.100 --> 01:13:51.100
and it may help understand and explain actions,

01:13:51.100 --> 01:13:54.100
which is why it's important to approach these situations with sympathy,

01:13:54.100 --> 01:13:56.100
but it is never an entire explanation,

01:13:56.100 --> 01:14:01.100
because the moment it becomes that you're not only painting all those people with personality disorders in a bad light,

01:14:01.100 --> 01:14:04.100
but you are giving a person a blank check to let it happen again.

01:14:04.100 --> 01:14:08.100
So you shouldn't take offence when you don't know what's what.

01:14:08.100 --> 01:14:12.100
You just can't take offence to stuff when people are just talking.

01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:19.100
Later, if you're able to substantiate these things and find out that Moses is not trustworthy,

01:14:19.100 --> 01:14:23.100
or does feel the way that Trisha's telling you, well then it's something to talk about.

01:14:23.100 --> 01:14:26.100
But in the meantime, it's just whatever, don't react.

01:14:26.100 --> 01:14:31.100
In a way, I think the problem comes down to the fact that Dr Drew has been brought on to save the podcast,

01:14:31.100 --> 01:14:35.100
and maybe the only viable option in their mind is for Ethan to appease Trisha,

01:14:35.100 --> 01:14:37.100
but it's not a healthy option long term,

01:14:37.100 --> 01:14:41.100
and maybe in this scenario, the only way to save their actual substantive friendship

01:14:41.100 --> 01:14:43.100
is to seek real therapy for each other,

01:14:43.100 --> 01:14:47.100
and maybe not have every single interaction be a public spectacle.

01:14:47.100 --> 01:14:51.100
I think, first of all, I'm willing to admit my mistake.

01:14:51.100 --> 01:14:56.100
I should have definitely talked to you about this before we started recording.

01:14:56.100 --> 01:14:57.100
I should have said, hey-

01:14:57.100 --> 01:15:00.100
Can I stop you right there? That does not feel like you mean it.

01:15:00.100 --> 01:15:03.100
Oh, it doesn't? I do mean it.

01:15:03.100 --> 01:15:05.100
Make it really clear that you mean it,

01:15:05.100 --> 01:15:09.100
because this will come back around to hurt you if she isn't convinced that you mean it.

01:15:09.100 --> 01:15:13.100
One of the greatest issues of this generation of Hollywood experts and wannabe therapists

01:15:13.100 --> 01:15:17.100
is that they are better at being media personalities than they are at dealing with real people

01:15:17.100 --> 01:15:20.100
who wouldn't typically deal with their issues in the public spotlight.

01:15:20.100 --> 01:15:23.100
I think it's completely acceptable to provide live advice in a format

01:15:23.100 --> 01:15:25.100
that allows you to keep the person seeking advice anonymous,

01:15:25.100 --> 01:15:28.100
or at least not make them the centre of the matter at hand.

01:15:28.100 --> 01:15:31.100
However, when you're applying a very personal type of therapy,

01:15:31.100 --> 01:15:34.100
you need more than charisma to make sure that what you're saying is actually helpful

01:15:34.100 --> 01:15:37.100
for those who will inevitably take those words to heart.

01:15:37.100 --> 01:15:38.100
Especially someone like Trisha.

01:15:38.100 --> 01:15:41.100
What we were watching wasn't therapy, it was theatre,

01:15:41.100 --> 01:15:44.100
and it was questioned whether the people involved were better off for it.

01:15:44.100 --> 01:15:47.100
But I feel like with each of these blowups, you guys get,

01:15:47.100 --> 01:15:52.100
I wouldn't say closer together, but it helps you guys manage your relationship better.

01:15:52.100 --> 01:15:55.100
Also, this is the bullying builds character of 2020.

01:15:55.100 --> 01:15:57.100
What a ridiculous statement.

01:16:08.100 --> 01:16:10.100
Tell me what you think about the truth about what I mean by that.

01:16:10.100 --> 01:16:11.100
You're asking me right now.

01:16:11.100 --> 01:16:12.100
Because you're not being honest.

01:16:12.100 --> 01:16:14.100
Okay, but do you want me to reply? I will be honest,

01:16:14.100 --> 01:16:16.100
but I don't want you to be like, you're attacking my parenting.

01:16:16.100 --> 01:16:17.100
Do you want my honest opinion?

01:16:17.100 --> 01:16:19.100
No, because you said, well, okay.

01:16:19.100 --> 01:16:21.100
You say, okay, well, your mom should be here then.

01:16:21.100 --> 01:16:24.100
I do think I would have my mom watch over a nanny.

01:16:24.100 --> 01:16:26.100
I don't trust strangers with my personal experience.

01:16:26.100 --> 01:16:28.100
I don't think your nanny's the worst.

01:16:28.100 --> 01:16:29.100
I'm just saying my personal experience.

01:16:29.100 --> 01:16:33.100
This is not the exact conversation that happened,

01:16:33.100 --> 01:16:35.100
and I don't think it's productive to go over it now.

01:16:35.100 --> 01:16:36.100
Well, you just asked me.

01:16:36.100 --> 01:16:38.100
Did you not just ask me to give you my opinion on this?

01:16:38.100 --> 01:16:39.100
And that's what I'm saying.

01:16:39.100 --> 01:16:40.100
Do you really want me to tell you?

01:16:40.100 --> 01:16:41.100
I will.

01:16:41.100 --> 01:16:42.100
I have no problem with it.

01:16:42.100 --> 01:16:43.100
We already talked about this.

01:16:43.100 --> 01:16:46.100
Okay, but you just asked me to give you an opinion again about it.

01:16:46.100 --> 01:16:47.100
I heard your opinion.

01:16:47.100 --> 01:16:48.100
I heard it.

01:16:48.100 --> 01:16:49.100
I don't care to share it again.

01:16:49.100 --> 01:16:51.100
I'm just saying like, if he wants me to reply, I will.

01:16:51.100 --> 01:16:58.100
Because it's very obvious that she was in that moment digging as deep as possible.

01:16:58.100 --> 01:16:59.100
I was not digging it.

01:16:59.100 --> 01:17:00.100
He was pushing it.

01:17:00.100 --> 01:17:01.100
Okay.

01:17:01.100 --> 01:17:02.100
Okay.

01:17:02.100 --> 01:17:05.100
Now, a lot of Frenemy's audience really resented Trisha immediately after this episode,

01:17:05.100 --> 01:17:09.100
particularly given that Dr Drew's advice seems slanted in their favour,

01:17:09.100 --> 01:17:12.100
but I find it hard to blame them in many ways for the actual advice they received.

01:17:12.100 --> 01:17:15.100
The buck stops at self-proclaimed experts in this case,

01:17:15.100 --> 01:17:17.100
and it's not like they're completely in the wrong.

01:17:17.100 --> 01:17:22.100
Trisha does deserve sympathy, but just not in a way that invalidates how Ethan feels.

01:17:22.100 --> 01:17:27.100
If Ethan was the therapist type, then maybe he'd be able to handle Trisha in a way that doesn't affect him,

01:17:27.100 --> 01:17:31.100
but he's clearly bothered by Trisha's behaviour because Ethan is not a therapist.

01:17:31.100 --> 01:17:33.100
In fact, sometimes he can be quite the opposite.

01:17:33.100 --> 01:17:37.100
H3 is a hypocrite, because he said n***a on his podcast.

01:17:37.100 --> 01:17:42.100
It's like, dude, you are fucking, you call yourself a news source, like get fucking real.

01:17:42.100 --> 01:17:47.100
You know what, if you think I'm wrong, if you think that I'm a racist and a hypocrite,

01:17:47.100 --> 01:17:51.100
if you didn't bother to watch the podcast and you downvoted and you left a mean comment

01:17:51.100 --> 01:17:54.100
and you called me a hypocrite, fuck off.

01:17:54.100 --> 01:17:56.100
Unsubscribe.

01:17:56.100 --> 01:17:58.100
Don't watch.

01:17:58.100 --> 01:18:01.100
Because we'll have a lot less of that shit to deal with in the future.

01:18:01.100 --> 01:18:04.100
Team Star, the pinnacle of logic and sanity on YouTube.

01:18:04.100 --> 01:18:06.100
I have a strange relationship with Ethan Klein.

01:18:06.100 --> 01:18:09.100
I was always a massive fan of his work with H3H3 Productions,

01:18:09.100 --> 01:18:13.100
and I don't think my appreciation for his content has ever fully dissipated,

01:18:13.100 --> 01:18:18.100
but I do think the podcast kinda revealed to me that he had a few more layers than those which were displayed on the original channel,

01:18:18.100 --> 01:18:21.100
and in a way, it's not exactly a massive surprise.

01:18:21.100 --> 01:18:24.100
He always had the ability to be quite pointed towards people,

01:18:24.100 --> 01:18:26.100
I mean, that's how he first came into conflict with Trisha,

01:18:26.100 --> 01:18:29.100
but when it's in that environment, you can always write it off as comedy.

01:18:29.100 --> 01:18:34.100
On the podcast, it didn't always feel like that, it can come across as quite cynical and trenchant.

01:18:34.100 --> 01:18:37.100
I think sometimes that can provoke people, mostly people who aren't there,

01:18:37.100 --> 01:18:40.100
but still, if you're doing a podcast with a person who is easily provoked,

01:18:40.100 --> 01:18:42.100
then maybe you should be more considerate,

01:18:42.100 --> 01:18:46.100
but at the same time, you also need to retain some sort of sense of self,

01:18:46.100 --> 01:18:48.100
otherwise you're gonna be holding yourself back,

01:18:48.100 --> 01:18:52.100
and I think the challenge posed to Ethan after this episode was one of great magnitude,

01:18:52.100 --> 01:18:55.100
yet although I've made it clear that I think Dr Drew's advice was subpar,

01:18:55.100 --> 01:18:59.100
I think Ethan seemed to find his own resolution that worked quite well for a bit.

01:19:00.100 --> 01:19:06.100
What we have here today is the steamies, as if drinking the piping hot steamy tea.

01:19:06.100 --> 01:19:08.100
Oh, I thought it was like a steamy dump.

01:19:08.100 --> 01:19:11.100
Yeah, that also went through my head.

01:19:11.100 --> 01:19:14.100
You can think of it either way, it's a steamy dump, it's a steamy tea.

01:19:14.100 --> 01:19:20.100
What it is, is the real award show of 2020 that you wish was here,

01:19:20.100 --> 01:19:24.100
but the steamies are too much cowards to actually cover what matters.

01:19:24.100 --> 01:19:29.100
The next episode after Dr Drew was the steamies, a self acclaimed honest spin on the streamies,

01:19:29.100 --> 01:19:33.100
an award show where all the fantastic influencers celebrate their successes.

01:19:33.100 --> 01:19:36.100
However, in the steamies, these awards were a bit more ironic,

01:19:36.100 --> 01:19:41.100
with Trisha even being in attendance to pick out their award for the most dramatic creator,

01:19:41.100 --> 01:19:42.100
what a coincidence.

01:19:43.100 --> 01:19:48.100
47.1% Trisha Banks!

01:19:48.100 --> 01:19:51.100
Wow, you won, here it is.

01:19:51.100 --> 01:19:58.100
Most dramatic creator of the year, they love you, they really love you.

01:19:59.100 --> 01:20:13.100
And we have a very own Frenemies styled rhinestones steamies presented to you.

01:20:13.100 --> 01:20:20.100
We're going to have to get this engraved for Trisha Paytas, most dramatic creator of 2020.

01:20:20.100 --> 01:20:21.100
Congratulations.

01:20:21.100 --> 01:20:24.100
Their first video of the new year seemed to follow in a similar direction,

01:20:24.100 --> 01:20:26.100
and it helped they have the substance to work with.

01:20:26.100 --> 01:20:29.100
Frenemies is under attack, that's going to be the title, it's going to be really good.

01:20:29.100 --> 01:20:31.100
Frenemies is under attack, okay I like that.

01:20:31.100 --> 01:20:33.100
It's true though, it's true.

01:20:33.100 --> 01:20:37.100
Most two of YouTube's most controversial personalities is creating new conversations about mental health.

01:20:37.100 --> 01:20:39.100
That sounds good, right?

01:20:39.100 --> 01:20:44.100
I don't like being a poster child for like mental health, all of a sudden it's like BPG and mental health.

01:20:44.100 --> 01:20:47.100
I agree, I don't like it either, we're just two friends doing a podcast.

01:20:47.100 --> 01:20:50.100
I did watch your H3 live a little bit about someone saying like,

01:20:50.100 --> 01:20:55.100
I just hate that that's what it's about, like how dare he collab with a girl with a mental health issues.

01:20:55.100 --> 01:20:58.100
It's not like I killed somebody and I should be like locked in prison forever.

01:20:58.100 --> 01:21:02.100
You see, over the Christmas parade, their squabbles and subsequent attempts to patch it up

01:21:02.100 --> 01:21:04.100
had caught the eye of certain publications and creators,

01:21:04.100 --> 01:21:08.100
who felt that the content published on the Frenemies podcast bordered on exploited.

01:21:08.100 --> 01:21:13.100
Ethan as the chief organiser of topics comes in with the spin that Frenemies is under attack,

01:21:13.100 --> 01:21:17.100
maybe a bit hyperbolic, but it provides a springboard for them to reinforce their bond.

01:21:17.100 --> 01:21:20.100
I think in this case it works, uniting them around a cause.

01:21:20.100 --> 01:21:23.100
Ethan also goes out of his way to reassure and support Trisha.

01:21:23.100 --> 01:21:25.100
A lot of people really appreciated this,

01:21:25.100 --> 01:21:30.100
they used this momentum to transition into a really good segment in it where they just watch old clips of Trisha on TV,

01:21:30.100 --> 01:21:35.100
something that I absolutely adore, maybe it's just my love of game shows, but it's really wholesome.

01:21:35.100 --> 01:21:37.100
The entire episode is actually quite great,

01:21:37.100 --> 01:21:41.100
and many people commented how refreshing it was that they genuinely seemed like friends here,

01:21:41.100 --> 01:21:46.100
and I began to think, maybe Dr Drew's advice wasn't the best, maybe his tone was too blase for most,

01:21:46.100 --> 01:21:51.100
but maybe it's what made Trisha the happiest, maybe it's what made them the most confident going into the podcast,

01:21:51.100 --> 01:21:56.100
and maybe it provided a sense of resolution on that identity issue that they had expressed conflict over.

01:21:56.100 --> 01:22:01.100
Therapy isn't a one-size-fits-all method, and if Ethan's main goal was to keep the podcast going,

01:22:01.100 --> 01:22:06.100
and he still seemed to have a good time, then who was I to judge? Maybe I was being too critical.

01:22:06.100 --> 01:22:09.100
Yeah, they're like, if you touch her, you'll be escorted off, like mid-show, we don't care.

01:22:09.100 --> 01:22:12.100
I was like, okay, and then I touched your own ass, and I was like, oh no!

01:22:12.100 --> 01:22:16.100
What a diva, you're just Ellen, you're just a TV host, you're not the fucking queen.

01:22:16.100 --> 01:22:17.100
I know, I was so nervous.

01:22:17.100 --> 01:22:20.100
Wait, I didn't, okay, see, this is great, I'm glad we're doing this.

01:22:20.100 --> 01:22:25.100
The episodes after this seem to be continuing in this vein, and people actually seem to be preferring this style.

01:22:25.100 --> 01:22:28.100
It still seemed pretty sharp and witty, but what a change.

01:22:28.100 --> 01:22:29.100
What about all the Beatles?

01:22:29.100 --> 01:22:32.100
Well, I think John Lennon's the only one that said that they're bigger than God.

01:22:32.100 --> 01:22:34.100
They all corroborate with it.

01:22:34.100 --> 01:22:36.100
To be honest, they kinda are bigger than God.

01:22:36.100 --> 01:22:40.100
I think God is the biggest.

01:22:40.100 --> 01:22:43.100
Okay, name one song he's made.

01:22:43.100 --> 01:22:45.100
Well, not much on the surface.

01:22:45.100 --> 01:22:51.100
Ethan didn't seem to become a shell of himself like some were probably worried, and Trisha seemed a lot more optimistic going into the new year.

01:22:51.100 --> 01:22:56.100
However, I do think the awards show illustrated one of Ethan and Trisha's greatest combined strengths,

01:22:56.100 --> 01:23:02.100
that although their spontaneity had its own appeal, they worked their best when they were building off and reacting to other material.

01:23:02.100 --> 01:23:09.100
It's a very simple observation at its core, but all of the worst arguments seem to begin when Ethan and Trisha become too fixated on themselves,

01:23:09.100 --> 01:23:14.100
and their own conduct, procedure, and sometimes that of the podcast and those close to them in the moment,

01:23:14.100 --> 01:23:16.100
typically when one of them took it personally.

01:23:16.100 --> 01:23:21.100
Sometimes it's a hard discussion to avoid, given Trisha's nature to go off on tangents about their personal life.

01:23:21.100 --> 01:23:25.100
Nonetheless, I think that Ethan came into 2021 with a refreshed sense of focus.

01:23:25.100 --> 01:23:30.100
Although they both were still somewhat easily distracted, he would often bring the video back to the core thesis.

01:23:30.100 --> 01:23:36.100
He didn't allow himself to be pulled away towards subjects that could lead down a problematic path, and I think that was definitely beneficial.

01:23:36.100 --> 01:23:41.100
I also think that with the new year and the new drama, there was a new purpose.

01:23:41.100 --> 01:23:46.100
Things seemed to be looking up for once, and whoever was responsible for it should have given themselves a pat on the back.

01:23:46.100 --> 01:23:52.100
Maybe Dr Drew was the therapist we didn't want, or the therapist we needed, but were we missing something?

01:24:04.100 --> 01:24:09.100
Here's the thing, there were a lot of theories at the time that Trisha and Ethan played up that drama for the camera,

01:24:09.100 --> 01:24:12.100
which is in a way what they were responding to that episode.

01:24:12.100 --> 01:24:17.100
Some believed there was a financial incentive to do so, and it's not like that theory holds no water,

01:24:17.100 --> 01:24:20.100
those moments did tend to receive more publicity from the podcast and other sources,

01:24:20.100 --> 01:24:25.100
but they were so successful without that conflict, it wasn't necessary for their collaboration subsistence,

01:24:25.100 --> 01:24:32.100
and often with the fate of the podcast on the line, it's not a boundary worth pushing, the long term trade-off was not worth it.

01:24:32.100 --> 01:24:38.100
If anything, the content at the start of 2021 showed that frenemies have the ability to be just as successful without hostility,

01:24:38.100 --> 01:24:45.100
and I think this movement towards a more cemented friendship was almost enough in itself, and very satisfying for audience members to watch.

01:24:45.100 --> 01:24:52.100
Now make no mistake, they were also helped by an influx of drama which covered creators that Trisha and Ethan both had interactions and history with,

01:24:52.100 --> 01:24:58.100
ranging from Shane to David Dobrik to James Charles, and when pickings were this plentiful, they didn't have to skimp out on topics.

01:24:59.100 --> 01:25:02.100
She was upset that I was going to make out with Seth, and so I flipped out.

01:25:02.100 --> 01:25:10.100
You being mad about the Seth make out thing is crazy. It's crazy. It's crazy.

01:25:10.100 --> 01:25:11.100
Is it?

01:25:12.100 --> 01:25:15.100
Was that real? Like him saying it's crazy three times, or is that edited?

01:25:15.100 --> 01:25:17.100
No, that's the clip, unedited.

01:25:20.100 --> 01:25:24.100
Not being comfortable with it, and here's the footage, and not only you saying you're not comfortable with it,

01:25:24.100 --> 01:25:30.100
but David was, I mean, look, people misuse gaslighting all the time, this is gaslighting.

01:25:30.100 --> 01:25:31.100
Right, right, right.

01:25:31.100 --> 01:25:34.100
Because you know something's wrong, and he's trying to convince you that you're crazy.

01:25:34.100 --> 01:25:35.100
Right.

01:25:35.100 --> 01:25:40.100
However, this didn't mean that they didn't share more personal moments or tackle difficult subjects.

01:25:40.100 --> 01:25:43.100
In fact, as I've shown, Ethan really went out of his way to support Trisha.

01:25:43.100 --> 01:25:49.100
They even had an episode where Trisha spoke about many of their struggles growing up, which at the time seemed pretty riveting.

01:25:49.100 --> 01:25:56.100
We weren't close. My dad was in California when we lived in Illinois, and my mom, I had issues with my stepdad, so that was my main focus.

01:25:56.100 --> 01:26:02.100
Well, not my stepdad, one of her boyfriends, and so that was my main focus at home, and then I tried to say stuff, and then I was like, oh, I'm not going to say anything.

01:26:02.100 --> 01:26:05.100
My mom worked for a job, so we were by ourselves all the time.

01:26:05.100 --> 01:26:08.100
She worked at the country club. She was a bus driver. She was a substitute teacher.

01:26:08.100 --> 01:26:13.100
She worked so much, and so her boyfriends would be home or whatever, but it was bad.

01:26:13.100 --> 01:26:18.100
It was, you know, I thought if my own principal doesn't believe me, no one's going to believe me.

01:26:18.100 --> 01:26:21.100
You're not a pathological liar anymore.

01:26:21.100 --> 01:26:23.100
Pathological? What's that?

01:26:23.100 --> 01:26:25.100
You said you're a chronic liar.

01:26:25.100 --> 01:26:28.100
Oh, like you think I'm lying about this now? No, I'm not lying about it.

01:26:28.100 --> 01:26:33.100
I just am asking because I know people are going to be like, she admits she's a pathological liar, and you can't trust anything she says.

01:26:33.100 --> 01:26:37.100
Um, like when I was younger, but I'm not now. I don't lie. I make a really conscious effort to not...

01:26:37.100 --> 01:26:39.100
I believe everything you say. I don't think you're a liar.

01:26:39.100 --> 01:26:44.100
Many people really felt like Trisha was beginning to change as a person, and in a way, they definitely were.

01:26:44.100 --> 01:26:51.100
They were being nice to Ethan, tolerating his assertive comments, saying a lot of genuinely sweet things that many viewers found legitimately endearing.

01:26:51.100 --> 01:26:55.100
However, I'll bring it back to Dr Drew, and the notion of mutual change that I felt was a bit neglected.

01:26:55.100 --> 01:26:59.100
At the end of the day, Ethan certainly was capable of doing more to accommodate Trisha,

01:26:59.100 --> 01:27:04.100
and if you would rather cater to Trish than ask more of them to keep the podcast going, then I think that's justified.

01:27:04.100 --> 01:27:08.100
But there was still one element that I think Trish needed to provide, and that was trust.

01:27:09.100 --> 01:27:15.100
I think my trust with, like, influencers in general, like, I really thought they were my friends, so when you kept being like,

01:27:15.100 --> 01:27:20.100
I'm here for you, I'm your friend, and I was like, uh, you know what I mean? I feel like maybe a lot of that is...

01:27:20.100 --> 01:27:24.100
I think there's plenty of other things that caused trauma in your life before that, though.

01:27:24.100 --> 01:27:28.100
I think that they really... I went to a mental hospital for the first time in my life after David and Jason.

01:27:28.100 --> 01:27:34.100
It should be no surprise that with their history and their dispositions, Trisha isn't a very trusting person,

01:27:34.100 --> 01:27:41.100
and in a way, it's not like I blame them. I think it's very difficult to trust people when you've had that trust abused in the way that Trisha seems to express it.

01:27:41.100 --> 01:27:46.100
However, Ethan isn't like those other people, and I have my problems with Ethan, make no mistake,

01:27:46.100 --> 01:27:52.100
but sometimes a weakness can also be a strength, and one of my criticisms is that Ethan can play favourites a little too much.

01:27:52.100 --> 01:27:58.100
Now everyone is biased, however, I think Ethan is unreasonably harsh towards some people, and far too lenient with others.

01:27:58.100 --> 01:28:05.100
Particularly in the episodes where they were covering drama, Ethan really used an aspect of himself to go at many people Trisha had expressed issues with,

01:28:05.100 --> 01:28:12.100
really asserting his loyalty, but Pater's reaction often showed there was still an inkling of doubters to Ethan's sincerity.

01:28:12.100 --> 01:28:20.100
It always just fell short of the heartfelt moment, at which point you began to wonder if there was anything Ethan could do to break through.

01:28:20.100 --> 01:28:39.100
Trisha isn't a stranger to making sassy comments, but they always seemed like a way to shift the tone of a conversation

01:28:39.100 --> 01:28:44.100
and prevent themselves from showing that vulnerability and trust that may allow someone like Klein in.

01:28:44.100 --> 01:28:49.100
You could tell their wall was built high, and in a normal world, many would say that this is profoundly illogical.

01:28:49.100 --> 01:28:56.100
Even if you loathe Ethan, all logical roots would point towards his desire to maintain good terms with Trisha, beyond the podcast as well.

01:28:56.100 --> 01:29:01.100
The personal investment was significant, especially given Trisha was now Moses's fiance.

01:29:01.100 --> 01:29:05.100
Hell, they even did a whole couples episode, with Hila making an appearance as well.

01:29:05.100 --> 01:29:08.100
Alright, Ethan and Trisha first.

01:29:35.100 --> 01:29:45.100
In many senses, Ethan was bending over backwards to stand up for Trisha.

01:29:45.100 --> 01:29:50.100
He gave them a platform to speak on certain matters, he believed them, he advocated for them at every opportunity.

01:29:50.100 --> 01:29:55.100
This caused backlash of points, particularly when he went toe to toe with other creators over dramatic matters,

01:29:55.100 --> 01:30:02.100
particularly when people didn't believe Trisha's testimonies, which outside of the H3 fanbase was still a significant online presence.

01:30:02.100 --> 01:30:07.100
In numerous episodes where David Debrick and the Vlog Squad are addressed, Trisha has a lot of history and baggage with them,

01:30:07.100 --> 01:30:11.100
and much of that is aired to the point where Trisha claimed that lawyers were becoming evil.

01:30:33.100 --> 01:30:48.100
Ethan was prepared to antagonise himself to certain audiences if it meant backing his partners,

01:30:48.100 --> 01:30:54.100
with Skep soon billing him as opportunistic and only siding with Trisha because of their status and the revenue it brought.

01:30:54.100 --> 01:30:59.100
Now, I'll give my own subjective opinion on it in due time, but it was divisive then,

01:30:59.100 --> 01:31:05.100
but between that divide, Ethan sided with Trisha. Was Trisha completely on Ethan's side?

01:31:05.100 --> 01:31:22.100
Well, in episode 29 there's this interesting interaction where Ethan makes a comment directed towards Trisha about their weight.

01:31:22.100 --> 01:31:28.100
Trisha then retorts by insulting his hair, this then leads into a rather elongated discussion about which one of them is fatter,

01:31:28.100 --> 01:31:37.100
all in all it seems like a pretty inconsequential conversation, until around 40 minutes later when Trisha decides to retract their statement and apologise for their previous comment.

01:31:58.100 --> 01:32:04.100
At that moment it seems like quite a nice gesture, but there's a catch.

01:32:29.100 --> 01:32:33.100
Now, if you believe that Ethan should have apologised for his comment then fair enough,

01:32:33.100 --> 01:32:37.100
but it's a strange situation because those sorts of jokes never seemed off-limit prior,

01:32:37.100 --> 01:32:43.100
and as Ethan points out, the expectation that someone else should apologise for something isn't a good motive for an apology.

01:32:43.100 --> 01:32:48.100
The point is though that he didn't apologise, and there's a moment of awkwardness while Trisha processes Ethan's response,

01:32:48.100 --> 01:32:52.100
and you just have this feeling that something still isn't quite there for them.

01:32:52.100 --> 01:32:58.100
Ethan was only prepared to compromise on so much, and it was unclear whether Trisha was fully satisfied with that.

01:32:58.100 --> 01:33:02.100
The End

01:33:15.100 --> 01:33:18.100
With acknowledgement to the previous part and everything life said in it,

01:33:18.100 --> 01:33:23.100
The Frenemies episode still seemed headed in the right direction, with an energy that did become more positive.

01:33:23.100 --> 01:33:27.100
It still seemed viable that Trisha would finally settle in the place that they were,

01:33:27.100 --> 01:33:33.100
with the people they were with. The absence of those more large-scale conflicts would make many believe we were perhaps

01:33:33.100 --> 01:33:38.100
approaching calmer waters, and no one could really be blamed for expecting anything else.

01:33:38.100 --> 01:33:42.100
At the start of episode 37, Trisha seems in rather high spirits.

01:33:42.100 --> 01:33:47.100
They mention that there had been an argument with Klein, but both parties express reluctance to delve into details,

01:33:47.100 --> 01:33:52.100
and they seem happy to move on from it. Maybe people noted how exuberant Trisha was during this episode,

01:33:52.100 --> 01:33:54.100
maybe even a bit too exuberant.

01:33:55.100 --> 01:34:00.100
So anyway guys, head on over to Trisha, or sadboy2005.com

01:34:00.100 --> 01:34:05.100
This is our first collab, we have four more collabs coming out this year, and then we're gonna start our own in-house stuff.

01:34:05.100 --> 01:34:11.100
Daddy First is definitely an inspiration. I've always wanted to do a clothing line, but I never saw anyone do it.

01:34:11.100 --> 01:34:15.100
Not that it's easy, but seeing you guys do it, I was like, this could be attainable. You know what I mean?

01:34:15.100 --> 01:34:20.100
I feel like, I don't know. Anyways, I'm really excited. I feel like the quality is good.

01:34:20.100 --> 01:34:25.100
Everything's hand stitched, hand printed, like this is hand dyed, this is hand sprayed on, yeah.

01:34:25.100 --> 01:34:28.100
They dyed this, this purple and blue.

01:34:30.100 --> 01:34:35.100
Someone questioned a few of the comments made during this podcast on whether they were completely alright,

01:34:35.100 --> 01:34:38.100
with someone wondering if they were having a manic episode.

01:34:38.100 --> 01:34:44.100
Regardless, as good as their mood appeared to be, there was one talking point they did briefly stop on.

01:34:45.100 --> 01:34:49.100
They're about they're about equal kind of a point for me. Oh, my God.

01:34:52.100 --> 01:35:05.100
Technically, we because you didn't actually anyways, you know, I pay logistic, but you get a little extra from front of me said to pay the crew. So we pay them for Mondays. You did tell me that. Oh, so I pay them to from our earnings of interesting.

01:35:06.100 --> 01:35:14.100
The arrangement between the two split the podcast profits 55% to 45% in Ethan's favour, with 5% going towards production costs.

01:35:14.100 --> 01:35:19.100
In exchange, Ethan also claims that he organises the episodes and does the rest of the work.

01:35:19.100 --> 01:35:27.100
Trisha decides that this isn't really a topic for discussion right now, and although Ethan persists a little longer, the conversation subsides shortly after.

01:35:27.100 --> 01:35:32.100
It seems like a mostly trifling detour, one of many, but I'll put a pin in it for future reference.

01:35:32.100 --> 01:35:40.100
The next episode is a mostly entertaining, albeit uneventful vlog, where Trisha continues to impress people with their encyclopedic knowledge of Hollywood.

01:35:50.100 --> 01:35:59.100
They're actually right, fair play. Anyhow, I digress, though once again Trisha does scold Ethan for not coming in costume, it all seems fairly friendly, and I shan't dwell on it.

01:35:59.100 --> 01:36:02.100
I think we should turn our attention to the next episode.

01:36:16.100 --> 01:36:22.100
In this episode there is a pretty significant development in the client's personal life, that being that Hila is now pregnant.

01:36:22.100 --> 01:36:30.100
The podcast's reaction seems fairly elated, and Trisha seems equally excited for the both of them, even being surprisingly self-aware about their emotional response to the news.

01:36:30.100 --> 01:36:52.100
I think a lot of people have retrospectively tried to read into Trisha's response here, but honestly nothing seems particularly out of the ordinary.

01:36:52.100 --> 01:36:59.100
Trisha seems pretty hyped about the release of their new music video, which is an homage to My Chemical Romance, and it was Pride Month as well.

01:37:00.100 --> 01:37:07.100
Maybe everything was turning out just as we had hoped, two couples, both happy and healthy, making their way in the world and rooting for each other.

01:37:07.100 --> 01:37:14.100
In spite of all the uncertainty, this may have been the completion of the arc that we had followed, but not all endings are as happy as we'd like them to be.

01:37:14.100 --> 01:37:19.100
It's difficult when you're watching these videos at that moment to really know exactly what's going on between them,

01:37:19.100 --> 01:37:24.100
and it was completely understandable that people had the impression that Ethan and Trisha were consolidating their friendship.

01:37:24.100 --> 01:37:28.100
The topics yielded a lot of unifying moments, and they seemed closer than ever in many ways.

01:37:28.100 --> 01:37:32.100
The incidents that I have picked out in the previous part didn't happen on a rather regular basis,

01:37:32.100 --> 01:37:37.100
but they still underlined that failure to take the final step to put that trust in Ethan's hand.

01:37:37.100 --> 01:37:43.100
There was still that doubt as to whether Ethan could give Trisha what they wanted, but what did Trisha want?

01:37:43.100 --> 01:37:58.100
One point that I've covered a while back was one of Trisha's first appearances on the podcast.

01:37:58.100 --> 01:38:08.100
They've always had a slightly strange dynamic with Ethan often switching between an I hate you stick and an off-puttingly flirtatious vibe that wasn't always met with approval by those who interacted with it.

01:38:13.100 --> 01:38:40.100
Now, I'm not here to say that I think Trisha ever hailed strong feelings for Ethan, although some people hypothesised it.

01:38:40.100 --> 01:38:44.100
I think their often quirky behaviour in that domain could be put down to past interactions.

01:38:44.100 --> 01:38:51.100
At the same time, I think there was definitely an expectation that at that point of the podcast, they would be the priority.

01:38:51.100 --> 01:38:56.100
I don't mean this in a romantic sense, but I think as they became more and more familiar with each other,

01:38:56.100 --> 01:39:01.100
Trisha seemed to develop a belief that they would have more influence on the general identity of the podcast itself,

01:39:01.100 --> 01:39:05.100
and they would be able to direct it rather than being this guest for hire.

01:39:05.100 --> 01:39:11.100
Trisha is an extremely distrusting person, and wherever there was something that seemed to bother them, some discrepancy in their mind,

01:39:11.100 --> 01:39:16.100
they would use it to fuel their own doubts, and to cut themselves loose from the person that they believed to be the source of that.

01:39:16.100 --> 01:39:23.100
I think Trisha, like many people, almost became enslaved by their own expectation, that expectation for the podcast to crash and burn.

01:39:23.100 --> 01:39:28.100
Every now and then they'd make these comments that invited Ethan to rise to the insult, or escalate them even,

01:39:28.100 --> 01:39:34.100
in a way that would provide them with some justification of completely severing that tie, freeing them from the obligation.

01:39:34.100 --> 01:39:38.100
It was a technique that often died down, and was even sometimes resolved shortly after,

01:39:38.100 --> 01:39:45.100
but if the mood was right, or wrong even, it was the sort of thing that could spiral, and in episode 39, it did.

01:39:45.100 --> 01:39:51.100
Alright, so anyway, I mentioned the name of the person who's finally ready to talk about Gabbie Hanna today.

01:39:51.100 --> 01:39:54.100
Talking about Gabbie Hanna, what could possibly go wrong?

01:39:56.100 --> 01:40:02.100
Unlike other episodes with instants, what we were about to witness wasn't immediately apparent judging by the thumbnail and title.

01:40:02.100 --> 01:40:06.100
This may be due to the fact that Ethan didn't want to make it seem like he was cashing in on the conflict,

01:40:06.100 --> 01:40:12.100
or perhaps because Ethan didn't view it as second to the much more prominent conversation relating to the titular subject,

01:40:12.100 --> 01:40:16.100
Gabbie Hanna, a person who may have helped bring Trisha and Ethan together in the first place.

01:40:16.100 --> 01:40:20.100
Episode 39 starts like many episodes do, unexceptionally.

01:40:20.100 --> 01:40:25.100
Trisha doesn't seem to be quite as energised as previous episodes, but it's not out of the realms of normality.

01:40:25.100 --> 01:40:28.100
Ethan is ominously dressed in an unconfessed costume again,

01:40:28.100 --> 01:40:33.100
have barely a few minutes in, and Trisha is already dissatisfied at the affairs relating to their costumes,

01:40:33.100 --> 01:40:36.100
seemingly frustrated by the lack of control they have over its selection.

01:40:59.100 --> 01:41:05.100
This goes on for a couple minutes before they reach some sort of resolution where Ethan commits to doing more Trisha's costume suggestions,

01:41:05.100 --> 01:41:08.100
and the next half an hour passes without major incident,

01:41:08.100 --> 01:41:12.100
though Trisha does make a few comments towards Ethan about the procedure of the podcast.

01:41:23.100 --> 01:41:26.100
However, one comment in particular that should have set up some red flags was this one.

01:41:29.100 --> 01:41:44.100
Here Trisha is setting a mark up, they are not in a good mood, they have a lot of hate in their hearts,

01:41:44.100 --> 01:41:48.100
and at that point Ethan tries to ease any tension by jovially reassuring Trisha,

01:41:48.100 --> 01:41:51.100
though they don't seem particularly heartened by his attempts.

01:41:51.100 --> 01:41:54.100
There's a skit shortly after which seems to cut through any agitation in the moment,

01:41:54.100 --> 01:41:58.100
but the topic of Gabbie Hanna, someone who Trisha has only stated they do not really like to discuss typically,

01:41:58.100 --> 01:42:01.100
given they believe Gabbie is stalking them, is a bold choice.

01:42:01.100 --> 01:42:04.100
It certainly seems to play into their sense of paranoia,

01:42:15.100 --> 01:42:21.100
how the conversation manages to tangentially end up at the ever-popular topic of pizza, and they bond over that.

01:42:21.100 --> 01:42:24.100
It seems the mood has been restored, and all is well once more,

01:42:24.100 --> 01:42:29.100
but then we cut to the ad segment, and we notice an empty chair alongside our festery friend.

01:42:29.100 --> 01:42:32.100
He explains the situation, and he doesn't seem too distraught about it,

01:42:32.100 --> 01:42:36.100
describing the incident as a little blowout, and proceeding with the routine ad reads.

01:42:36.100 --> 01:42:41.100
However, regardless of the scale of this clash, it was obviously a departure from the conflict-free record,

01:42:41.100 --> 01:42:44.100
and many were left anticipating the inevitable, and what exactly would spawn it.

01:42:44.100 --> 01:42:49.100
While the topic of Gabbie Hanna continues, and while they both seem to have some sort of rational grasp on the topic,

01:42:49.100 --> 01:42:52.100
they do venture through some subjects that Trisha clearly finds triggering,

01:42:52.100 --> 01:42:56.100
particularly regarding an interview which they felt wasn't completely in good faith.

01:42:56.100 --> 01:42:59.100
Trisha seems to take this quite seriously, but also quite soberly,

01:42:59.100 --> 01:43:01.100
and Ethan provides his standard support,

01:43:01.100 --> 01:43:06.100
though they do seem to dwell on points that may be considered a little morbid for someone of Trisha's paranoid disposition,

01:43:06.100 --> 01:43:08.100
perhaps not the best choice.

01:43:08.100 --> 01:43:11.100
We can't, there's no steamy nomination for her either, we cannot mention her ever again.

01:43:11.100 --> 01:43:13.100
Most likely to assassinate Trisha Paytas.

01:43:13.100 --> 01:43:14.100
Stop!

01:43:14.100 --> 01:43:15.100
And the winner is...

01:43:15.100 --> 01:43:18.100
And then we invite her up, and we give her a knife as a reward.

01:43:18.100 --> 01:43:22.100
Stop! That's why I bring security, I have security guards that come with me everywhere, I'm not kidding.

01:43:22.100 --> 01:43:24.100
She will show up.

01:43:24.100 --> 01:43:27.100
Most likely to kill Trisha with this knife.

01:43:27.100 --> 01:43:28.100
So scary.

01:43:28.100 --> 01:43:33.100
With all that said, there is the idea that Trisha being able to vent may have been able to lift that weight off their shoulders,

01:43:33.100 --> 01:43:36.100
and they seem to express this sentiment of greater stability as well,

01:43:36.100 --> 01:43:38.100
since cutting certain toxic people out of their life.

01:43:38.100 --> 01:43:43.100
Even my aura, my stability in my mind, the fact that I can handle triggers.

01:43:43.100 --> 01:43:44.100
Good auras.

01:43:44.100 --> 01:43:48.100
Do you know what I mean? Yeah, and I've gone to therapy, I've been going to therapy since 2019, so you could say therapy,

01:43:48.100 --> 01:43:53.100
but at the same time, I'm like, I really think since I really left that, everything's been so much better.

01:43:53.100 --> 01:43:54.100
Very interesting.

01:43:54.100 --> 01:43:57.100
Yeah, everything, like health, like money, like everything just flows friendships.

01:43:57.100 --> 01:44:01.100
But then, not too soon after the pizzas arrived, there were signs of discontent.

01:44:01.100 --> 01:44:06.100
No, I got black olives, pineapple, and jalapeno, and it's insane. So good.

01:44:06.100 --> 01:44:11.100
Wait, no, not my discontent, Trisha's discontent, though we are gonna have words about those pineapples, Ethan.

01:44:11.100 --> 01:44:15.100
No, the real problem arises when Trisha begins to talk about Brokeback Mountain,

01:44:15.100 --> 01:44:20.100
a romantic drama about two cowboys who've become romantically intertwined in a rather unaccepting environment.

01:44:20.100 --> 01:44:25.100
Trisha was clearly very invested in the plotline, and also the narratives that were still relevant to this day in their mind.

01:44:25.100 --> 01:44:30.100
Ethan, however, becomes a little distracted by the pizza, and the awkwardness radiates through the screen.

01:44:30.100 --> 01:44:33.100
There's still, people are still like that, like trans people arguing feet in their face to death.

01:44:33.100 --> 01:44:35.100
Oh, I'm so over that shit.

01:44:35.100 --> 01:44:43.100
And so like watching it, I was just like holy shit, and like Heath Ledger, Jake Gyllenhaal said Heath Ledger refused to make like gay jokes about it like during the Oscars, and I don't know.

01:44:43.100 --> 01:44:44.100
Is there a third pizza?

01:44:44.100 --> 01:44:46.100
You're so not good about this.

01:44:46.100 --> 01:44:48.100
I just want to make sure that everyone got pizza.

01:44:48.100 --> 01:44:50.100
I don't like this segment, just for the record, fan advice is so stupid.

01:44:50.100 --> 01:44:54.100
It's a little rude on Ethan's part given the subject, but it's nothing that needs to escalate.

01:44:54.100 --> 01:44:57.100
How Patricia, clearly feeling wronged, decides to go in.

01:44:57.100 --> 01:45:02.100
I never pick the costumes, I never do the vlogs, I give so many ideas, I say dancing for the vlogs, I give all these ideas, and you don't.

01:45:02.100 --> 01:45:03.100
What's wrong with the advice?

01:45:03.100 --> 01:45:04.100
I don't think it's a good segment.

01:45:04.100 --> 01:45:05.100
The people want to hear from us.

01:45:05.100 --> 01:45:06.100
Okay, do it.

01:45:06.100 --> 01:45:11.100
I'm telling you my opinion and all the vlogs we've done, I've suggested other vlogs and like that never does.

01:45:11.100 --> 01:45:13.100
Well if you don't like it, then we shouldn't do it.

01:45:13.100 --> 01:45:14.100
Okay.

01:45:14.100 --> 01:45:15.100
In terms of the show about me and you.

01:45:15.100 --> 01:45:17.100
No, but you're saying I do all the work, but I'm telling you I don't like all the stuff you do.

01:45:17.100 --> 01:45:22.100
I'm just kind of go with it because I'm like, okay, I guess this is what you want to do, but I have to start saying no, because some things are just not good ideas.

01:45:22.100 --> 01:45:29.100
Although this feels like a rather dramatic change in tone, you can tell that these are frustrations that have been boiling up, particularly given their prior mentions.

01:45:30.100 --> 01:45:36.100
Although Ethan feels like he does the heavy lifting, Trisha clearly doesn't feel like they've been given the chance to, and is quite blunt about it.

01:45:36.100 --> 01:45:39.100
They also don't think the material for the podcast is original enough.

01:45:39.100 --> 01:45:41.100
But you're asking like, we do all the work.

01:45:41.100 --> 01:45:47.100
It's like we spent one friend of me rehashing all the stuff you said about Keemstar and H3 Live, which was two days prior.

01:45:47.100 --> 01:45:48.100
Okay, it happened one time.

01:45:48.100 --> 01:45:52.100
No, it's happened before where you just like bring up stuff that you already mentioned and it's fine.

01:45:52.100 --> 01:45:53.100
Why are you attacking me?

01:45:53.100 --> 01:45:57.100
You asked me, you said tell me, and I'm telling you like all your, just because you guys come up with everything doesn't mean it's good.

01:45:57.100 --> 01:45:59.100
It's recycled, a lot of it, so it's like I can come up with new ideas.

01:45:59.100 --> 01:46:00.100
Not a lot of it.

01:46:00.100 --> 01:46:01.100
A lot of it.

01:46:01.100 --> 01:46:02.100
No.

01:46:02.100 --> 01:46:03.100
Mm-hmm.

01:46:03.100 --> 01:46:04.100
If you have ideas, I'm all ears.

01:46:04.100 --> 01:46:06.100
I watch H3 Live and we talk about the same thing, and I'm happy to talk about it.

01:46:06.100 --> 01:46:07.100
It's not always like that.

01:46:07.100 --> 01:46:08.100
It's happened before, I agree.

01:46:08.100 --> 01:46:09.100
It happened last time.

01:46:09.100 --> 01:46:10.100
It's happened a lot.

01:46:10.100 --> 01:46:12.100
Sometimes I forget what I've talked about, honestly.

01:46:12.100 --> 01:46:17.100
But you're saying you have all this crew that does all this work for you, and nobody could remember that you talked about that two days prior?

01:46:17.100 --> 01:46:18.100
I agree.

01:46:18.100 --> 01:46:19.100
Somebody should have said something.

01:46:19.100 --> 01:46:22.100
I was like, guys, why don't you tell me when I'm talking about the same shit over and over?

01:46:22.100 --> 01:46:24.100
Because I tell to them, I go, yo, make sure to include this.

01:46:24.100 --> 01:46:27.100
And they go, okay, but I go, oh shit, I talked about the same thing.

01:46:27.100 --> 01:46:33.100
Ethan defends himself on this front, though conceding on one point, while asking Trisha to be a bit more honest with their emotions,

01:46:33.100 --> 01:46:38.100
something which then prolongs this tension, eventually leading into the dreaded discussion surrounding revenue split,

01:46:38.100 --> 01:46:40.100
which once again comes back to the notion of control.

01:46:40.100 --> 01:46:42.100
But I feel like you're so angry about this.

01:46:42.100 --> 01:46:44.100
I'm literally not, but it's so funny.

01:46:44.100 --> 01:46:45.100
At least you are.

01:46:45.100 --> 01:46:46.100
I'm not, I'm angry when you say something.

01:46:46.100 --> 01:46:47.100
You need to admit when you're angry.

01:46:47.100 --> 01:46:49.100
Ethan, I promise you, this really is gaslighting.

01:46:49.100 --> 01:46:51.100
I go to a lot of therapy right now, and this really is.

01:46:51.100 --> 01:46:53.100
When I say I'm not angry, I'm not.

01:46:53.100 --> 01:46:57.100
I'm just trying to tell you that you're like, oh, we do everything for the show, and I'm saying it's not always good.

01:46:57.100 --> 01:46:58.100
I'm not angry.

01:46:58.100 --> 01:47:00.100
If I was angry, I would leave or something, but I'm not.

01:47:00.100 --> 01:47:01.100
But you're telling me I'm angry?

01:47:01.100 --> 01:47:02.100
You're upset or something.

01:47:02.100 --> 01:47:03.100
I'm not.

01:47:03.100 --> 01:47:04.100
People we hire.

01:47:04.100 --> 01:47:06.100
Why would I ask you about people I hire?

01:47:06.100 --> 01:47:08.100
Because it's front of me, and you take the budget for paying for the crew.

01:47:08.100 --> 01:47:09.100
That's what you told me.

01:47:09.100 --> 01:47:11.100
You take highlights, you take 5% to pay the crew.

01:47:11.100 --> 01:47:14.100
So why don't I get any input on the crew or what we do?

01:47:14.100 --> 01:47:16.100
These are employees of our production company.

01:47:16.100 --> 01:47:18.100
So why are you taking highlights and 5% in front of me?

01:47:18.100 --> 01:47:20.100
You told me that it was to pay them.

01:47:20.100 --> 01:47:22.100
It's for production costs.

01:47:22.100 --> 01:47:27.100
Okay, but you told me at the beginning, it's like they could be working on other things.

01:47:27.100 --> 01:47:28.100
So I made that argument, too.

01:47:28.100 --> 01:47:29.100
I'm like, well, they're already age 3.

01:47:29.100 --> 01:47:30.100
Oh, they could be working on other things.

01:47:30.100 --> 01:47:31.100
So I'm like, okay, in that case-

01:47:31.100 --> 01:47:32.100
It's for production costs.

01:47:32.100 --> 01:47:41.100
I take 5% extra from the podcast revenue, and I take the highlights revenue, and everything else we split.

01:47:41.100 --> 01:47:43.100
Right, so for production costs.

01:47:43.100 --> 01:47:45.100
Yeah, and so we had to buy-

01:47:45.100 --> 01:47:47.100
But that was the first time we ever spent money on production costs.

01:47:47.100 --> 01:47:49.100
It's not about that, dude.

01:47:49.100 --> 01:47:52.100
It's literally about we are producing the show, and I'm taking a cut.

01:47:52.100 --> 01:47:54.100
I feel like that's beyond reasonable.

01:47:54.100 --> 01:47:55.100
All the highlights.

01:47:55.100 --> 01:47:56.100
Beyond reasonable.

01:47:56.100 --> 01:47:57.100
5%.

01:47:57.100 --> 01:47:58.100
5%.

01:47:58.100 --> 01:47:59.100
Do you realize how much 5% was of our last one?

01:47:59.100 --> 01:48:00.100
That should be enough.

01:48:00.100 --> 01:48:04.100
But also highlights, and then you weren't the membership I had to fight for because you weren't-

01:48:04.100 --> 01:48:05.100
Oh, I forgot to tell you about the members.

01:48:05.100 --> 01:48:06.100
It's crazy.

01:48:06.100 --> 01:48:08.100
I'm giving you 50% of all the members.

01:48:08.100 --> 01:48:11.100
Trisha seems rather irritated, despite proclaiming that they're not.

01:48:11.100 --> 01:48:16.100
And when Ethan expresses this, it only seems to worsen their mood, with Trisha believing they're being gaslit.

01:48:16.100 --> 01:48:19.100
This then causes them to express doubt regarding Ethan's intentions.

01:48:19.100 --> 01:48:23.100
And then Ethan, once again giving up, concedes that he must have gaslit her.

01:48:23.100 --> 01:48:25.100
Because you can be upset and still show up.

01:48:25.100 --> 01:48:28.100
But I'm not upset, and that's what gaslighting is, because you're saying I'm gaslighting you by saying-

01:48:28.100 --> 01:48:30.100
I'm gaslighting you. You're not upset. You're perfectly-

01:48:30.100 --> 01:48:31.100
Oh, wow.

01:48:31.100 --> 01:48:32.100
You're in a perfect condition right now.

01:48:32.100 --> 01:48:34.100
But this was a great mistake.

01:48:34.100 --> 01:48:36.100
Wow. Holy cow, that's crazy.

01:48:36.100 --> 01:48:40.100
I mean, I don't know how you- I just don't see what you just did. That's really crazy.

01:48:40.100 --> 01:48:41.100
What did I do?

01:48:41.100 --> 01:48:43.100
We have to end it now. Like, really.

01:48:43.100 --> 01:48:45.100
What did I do?

01:48:45.100 --> 01:48:47.100
I'm gonna stop for real. Really.

01:48:47.100 --> 01:48:49.100
Okay.

01:48:49.100 --> 01:48:51.100
Please. Please.

01:48:53.100 --> 01:48:55.100
Trisha, let me just say, I'm sorry.

01:48:55.100 --> 01:48:57.100
The fact, Ethan, that you just did that, you're right.

01:48:57.100 --> 01:48:59.100
You're right. Nothing's wrong with you.

01:48:59.100 --> 01:49:01.100
That's- but I go- you don't know how much therapy I go to a week.

01:49:01.100 --> 01:49:03.100
I go to four Zoom sessions a week.

01:49:03.100 --> 01:49:05.100
I understand, but-

01:49:05.100 --> 01:49:07.100
Ethan, what you just said was, you're right, Trisha.

01:49:07.100 --> 01:49:09.100
Everything's fine. That's insane.

01:49:09.100 --> 01:49:11.100
The fact that you did that to me is like-

01:49:16.100 --> 01:49:19.100
This is one of the problems with the rollover strategy.

01:49:19.100 --> 01:49:21.100
Sometimes it's completely the wrong thing to do.

01:49:21.100 --> 01:49:25.100
In this case, Trisha is expressing a doubt, a product of paranoid thinking.

01:49:25.100 --> 01:49:28.100
There is no doubt in my mind that Ethan was not trying to gaslight them.

01:49:28.100 --> 01:49:30.100
He just wanted clarity on how they are feeling.

01:49:30.100 --> 01:49:32.100
But Trisha continued to push that theory,

01:49:32.100 --> 01:49:36.100
and in the hopes that admitting it would make it die down, Ethan does just that.

01:49:36.100 --> 01:49:38.100
The problem is that Trisha doesn't want that.

01:49:38.100 --> 01:49:41.100
They didn't want to be right in that case, because what they were expressing is something that

01:49:41.100 --> 01:49:45.100
represents their worst fears, that Ethan is just taking advantage of them and reaping the rewards,

01:49:45.100 --> 01:49:48.100
and psychologically deceiving them whenever they bring it up.

01:49:48.100 --> 01:49:52.100
In this case, their thoughts were that by framing their behaviour as angry or frustrated,

01:49:52.100 --> 01:49:56.100
Ethan was trying to use their emotional response to discredit their legitimate criticism.

01:49:56.100 --> 01:49:59.100
Although in a difficult spot, Ethan should have stood his ground,

01:49:59.100 --> 01:50:03.100
explained his perception, and tried to calm the situation through a rational de-escalation.

01:50:03.100 --> 01:50:07.100
But he did seem tired, and his concession, despite perhaps being a mistake,

01:50:07.100 --> 01:50:12.100
may have been a reflection of his own mental exhaustion of trying to upkeep a podcast that was taking its toll.

01:50:12.100 --> 01:50:17.100
With that said, given his sponsor segment, he clearly expected this to be resolved by the next episode.

01:50:17.100 --> 01:50:21.100
After all, we had seen Trisha evolve a lot as a person in her time on the podcast.

01:50:21.100 --> 01:50:24.100
Alas, this appeared to actually be the podcast's final episode,

01:50:24.100 --> 01:50:29.100
as the following morning Trisha announced that they were stepping down from Frenemies indefinitely.

01:50:29.100 --> 01:50:34.100
Trisha- I get it, I get now he's saying that H3O produces, and he deserves that as a producer,

01:50:34.100 --> 01:50:39.100
but it's like I would have loved the opportunity to pitch in half for the set to, you know,

01:50:39.100 --> 01:50:43.100
because I really do feel like I built this show like with them, like at 50-50,

01:50:43.100 --> 01:50:46.100
like I don't think I'm the main reason because God knows my channel

01:50:46.100 --> 01:50:50.100
and my podcast doesn't do like what Frenemies does, you know what I mean?

01:50:50.100 --> 01:50:55.100
But at the same time, like H3O, it wasn't doing what it's doing now either.

01:50:55.100 --> 01:50:59.100
I feel like I helped build that, like I thought Frenemies, we were building together,

01:50:59.100 --> 01:51:04.100
like from the beginning was like 5% goes to the, to help the crew,

01:51:04.100 --> 01:51:07.100
and then the other goes to production class, so I thought we were like building something,

01:51:07.100 --> 01:51:11.100
like building, it was going to be like a bigger set, bigger things, bigger vlogs,

01:51:11.100 --> 01:51:15.100
but it's just like, if I knew I was coming in as a third H3O show,

01:51:15.100 --> 01:51:19.100
like I swear hand to God would not have done it.

01:51:19.100 --> 01:51:23.100
And then yesterday just, you know, hearing that like, you know, he's the producer

01:51:23.100 --> 01:51:26.100
and he does everything when I just, I really tried hard to contribute

01:51:26.100 --> 01:51:30.100
and I really tried hard to like bring my own stuff every week and I feel like I did,

01:51:30.100 --> 01:51:35.100
I feel like I had topics and stuff and it's just like, it hurt me.

01:51:35.100 --> 01:51:38.100
As a video, it is extremely incoherent, but it's not hostile.

01:51:38.100 --> 01:51:41.100
Trisha expressed great regret over the decision they're taking

01:51:41.100 --> 01:51:46.100
and vents many of the frustrations that seem to be creeping up on them in the final podcast episodes.

01:51:46.100 --> 01:51:49.100
They felt that Frenemies had become such an independent force of content

01:51:49.100 --> 01:51:52.100
that they deserved a balanced input, something they didn't have.

01:51:53.100 --> 01:51:57.100
They in hindsight admit that they were frustrated, but didn't feel like they were in that moment,

01:51:57.100 --> 01:51:59.100
and obviously didn't respond well to Ethan's comments.

01:51:59.100 --> 01:52:04.100
They've also felt generally uncomfortable with the crew, and certain incidents have certainly underlined that.

01:52:04.100 --> 01:52:09.100
With the knowledge that this feeling is mutual, they don't want to return to that environment with anyone walking on eggshells.

01:52:09.100 --> 01:52:13.100
Although they stand by their gripes, they're clearly upset with how they handled it,

01:52:13.100 --> 01:52:18.100
and they wish it hadn't ended like that, and they hope they can remain firm friends with Ethan and Hila.

01:52:19.100 --> 01:52:25.100
I will say for the record, Ethan and Hila have been so freaking kind to me.

01:52:25.100 --> 01:52:30.100
And I hope it doesn't affect our personal relationship.

01:52:30.100 --> 01:52:37.100
Because obviously, they are, like, gotta be family.

01:52:37.100 --> 01:52:40.100
I really love them.

01:52:40.100 --> 01:52:44.100
But at the same time, I always say, don't work with family, don't work with people you're close with.

01:52:44.100 --> 01:52:47.100
I kind of feel that, you know, right?

01:52:47.100 --> 01:52:52.100
As a video, I can understand why some may have issues with its presentation and maybe its message too,

01:52:52.100 --> 01:52:56.100
but I honestly think that maybe stepping down was the best thing to do here,

01:52:56.100 --> 01:52:59.100
and Ethan seemed to reluctantly yet graciously accept their resignation,

01:52:59.100 --> 01:53:02.100
putting out a couple tweets on the matter which expressed disappointment,

01:53:02.100 --> 01:53:05.100
yet acceptance, stating that he had done all he could.

01:53:05.100 --> 01:53:07.100
Anyway, it was a bittersweet moment.

01:53:07.100 --> 01:53:10.100
With this in mind, we could finally bring the Frenemy saga to a close.

01:53:10.100 --> 01:53:15.100
A nice, peaceful close where everyone remains friends and we can all move forward together.

01:53:15.100 --> 01:53:19.100
This crazy yet flawed experiment was finally over.

01:53:19.100 --> 01:53:22.100
May it rest in peace.

01:53:22.100 --> 01:53:25.100
Yeah, right.

01:53:25.100 --> 01:53:27.100
There ain't no rest for the wicker though,

01:53:27.100 --> 01:53:32.100
and as quickly as it seemed the drama came to a peaceful conclusion, it reignited once again.

01:53:32.100 --> 01:53:36.100
Ethan was clearly unhappy that Trisha announced publicly that they were stepping back from the podcast

01:53:36.100 --> 01:53:38.100
before speaking to him, which I can understand,

01:53:38.100 --> 01:53:40.100
and he reached out expressing his own frustrations.

01:53:40.100 --> 01:53:44.100
Trisha responded to this by posting another video called One More Thing,

01:53:44.100 --> 01:53:47.100
not the title of their new sad boy song, admittedly.

01:53:47.100 --> 01:53:53.100
The H3 employees have nothing to do with Frenemies as far as our 5% salary.

01:53:53.100 --> 01:53:55.100
The 5% thing.

01:53:55.100 --> 01:53:59.100
Yes, Ethan gets an extra 5% from the main channel, but he also gets 100% of the highlights,

01:53:59.100 --> 01:54:02.100
so technically 105%, and the highlights make a shit ton of money.

01:54:02.100 --> 01:54:04.100
I add up the views of our Frenemies highlights,

01:54:04.100 --> 01:54:06.100
I'm not talking about the H3 highlights, I have our Frenemy highlights,

01:54:06.100 --> 01:54:08.100
and that's like, it's literally probably half of what we make.

01:54:08.100 --> 01:54:10.100
It's a lot, I would guess.

01:54:11.100 --> 01:54:14.100
Anywhere from $50,000 to like $80,000 a month, that's just a guess.

01:54:14.100 --> 01:54:16.100
I don't know, I don't see the numbers, I never do.

01:54:16.100 --> 01:54:19.100
And I'm not asking for the crew to be fired, the crew have been so great to me,

01:54:19.100 --> 01:54:22.100
I'm asking, and Ethan and I came to terms with it last night to have a producer,

01:54:22.100 --> 01:54:25.100
even if they had a new hire, I would love my sister.

01:54:25.100 --> 01:54:29.100
There's a couple couples working on a show or whatever,

01:54:29.100 --> 01:54:32.100
or people related to each other, the 5%, and talking about their salary,

01:54:32.100 --> 01:54:35.100
and the crew only gets 5%, I have no idea what the group gets paid,

01:54:35.100 --> 01:54:38.100
I lashed out that I didn't like the ideas, and I lashed out on Ethan,

01:54:39.100 --> 01:54:41.100
because Ethan is the one that presents me the ideas.

01:54:41.100 --> 01:54:44.100
I don't know how it works with them, I don't know who comes up with it,

01:54:44.100 --> 01:54:47.100
I don't know how they brainstorm, I don't know any of that,

01:54:47.100 --> 01:54:49.100
because I'm not included in any of that.

01:54:49.100 --> 01:54:52.100
The video is meant to be a clarification on the money matter,

01:54:52.100 --> 01:54:54.100
though once again, Trisha goes off on various tangents,

01:54:54.100 --> 01:54:57.100
and it seems mostly unexceptional as Trisha videos go,

01:54:57.100 --> 01:55:00.100
certainly a departure from the angry Trisha that we had seen before.

01:55:00.100 --> 01:55:03.100
Ethan, however, feeling that Trisha's responses were quite unsporting,

01:55:03.100 --> 01:55:07.100
tweeted his frustration, claiming that the video was causing undue hate towards the crew.

01:55:07.100 --> 01:55:10.100
Now, as a video, it's more defensive than aggressive,

01:55:10.100 --> 01:55:12.100
and I would be surprised if it changed that much,

01:55:12.100 --> 01:55:14.100
but once again, that was their experience.

01:55:14.100 --> 01:55:17.100
Trisha, however, obviously felt hard done by because they believed

01:55:17.100 --> 01:55:20.100
that Ethan was using the crew as a shield to try and attack their voice.

01:55:20.100 --> 01:55:23.100
I can understand why this may have bothered them in the moment,

01:55:23.100 --> 01:55:27.100
but the best thing they could do in that case was to make sure they didn't prove Ethan's point.

01:55:27.100 --> 01:55:31.100
We all know that when Trisha feels Ethan isn't being just, it will spiral,

01:55:31.100 --> 01:55:34.100
and from here there were a series of tweets by both parties,

01:55:34.100 --> 01:55:36.100
mostly Trisha, arguing their case.

01:55:36.100 --> 01:55:39.100
Many people were urging Trisha in particular to take a step back,

01:55:39.100 --> 01:55:41.100
especially after DMs began to be published,

01:55:41.100 --> 01:55:45.100
which actually ended backfiring when people pointed out Trisha's curious use of certain terms.

01:55:45.100 --> 01:55:48.100
In this case, both sides seemed to relent momentarily,

01:55:48.100 --> 01:55:51.100
with H3 stating that he needs to take a step back on the night

01:55:51.100 --> 01:55:53.100
and expressing regret over his tweets,

01:55:53.100 --> 01:55:55.100
and Trisha doing the same the following morning.

01:55:55.100 --> 01:55:57.100
Many wanted them to hash this out in private,

01:55:57.100 --> 01:56:00.100
and with both sides seeming to warp back their conduct a little,

01:56:00.100 --> 01:56:02.100
it was thought that maybe this would be the opportunity.

01:56:03.100 --> 01:56:07.100
The problem is that I think Trisha did legitimately feel like they were being treated poorly,

01:56:07.100 --> 01:56:11.100
and when they're trapped in an environment with someone who they feel is acting without the best intentions,

01:56:11.100 --> 01:56:14.100
they don't want to combine themselves to that space.

01:56:14.100 --> 01:56:17.100
Yet, instead of consulting a friend or a reliable third party,

01:56:17.100 --> 01:56:20.100
they decide to make the internet their trusted confidant,

01:56:20.100 --> 01:56:22.100
a generally bad decision, not just for yourself,

01:56:22.100 --> 01:56:27.100
but for the other person who feels that you're betraying their trust by taking it to such a public platform.

01:56:27.100 --> 01:56:31.100
Social media for Trisha was event space, and not one that was very healthy.

01:56:31.100 --> 01:56:55.100
The following morning, though, Trisha posted a video titled I'm Sorry,

01:56:55.100 --> 01:56:57.100
where they channel those regretful sentiments,

01:56:57.100 --> 01:57:00.100
they apologise a lot and believe it was a misunderstanding,

01:57:00.100 --> 01:57:05.100
and insist they don't want to be viewed as that hateful monster that they may have appeared as the day before.

01:57:05.100 --> 01:57:08.100
This is something that they genuinely felt bad about.

01:57:08.100 --> 01:57:13.100
With both sides back to a more sympathetic stance after a brief moment where emotions overflowed,

01:57:13.100 --> 01:57:16.100
it seemed that maybe both parties could find closure on this matter.

01:57:16.100 --> 01:57:19.100
This was the conclusion that we needed.

01:57:19.100 --> 01:57:22.100
However, it was not the conclusion that we deserved.

01:57:22.100 --> 01:57:24.100
Why did we forsake God?

01:57:24.100 --> 01:57:26.100
Hello everybody.

01:57:26.100 --> 01:57:30.100
Not a typical episode, obviously.

01:57:35.100 --> 01:57:41.100
Now, for many, episode 39 is technically regarded as the last episode of Frenemies.

01:57:41.100 --> 01:57:44.100
However, there is one more video in the Frenemies playlist,

01:57:44.100 --> 01:57:47.100
a video uploaded on the 10th of June 2021,

01:57:47.100 --> 01:57:49.100
two days after Trisha officially quit,

01:57:49.100 --> 01:57:52.100
by then addressing much of the drama that had been occurring.

01:57:52.100 --> 01:57:55.100
He comes into this video with the intent of correcting the record,

01:57:55.100 --> 01:57:58.100
given that Trisha had been making a variety of public statements.

01:57:58.100 --> 01:58:01.100
Ethan seemed to be approaching this with the signature peace and love,

01:58:01.100 --> 01:58:03.100
and not wishing to burn any bridges.

01:58:03.100 --> 01:58:08.100
So I say with peace and love that, you know, as a friend,

01:58:08.100 --> 01:58:13.100
I have come to love and appreciate Trisha.

01:58:13.100 --> 01:58:19.100
You know, as a partner, I think she's one of the funniest people I've ever known,

01:58:20.100 --> 01:58:24.100
you know, one of the most dynamic and entertaining people I've ever known.

01:58:24.100 --> 01:58:27.100
She puts me in these tough situations where it's like,

01:58:27.100 --> 01:58:29.100
I'm losing no matter what.

01:58:29.100 --> 01:58:34.100
She can say whatever she wants, you know, what she puts out publicly,

01:58:34.100 --> 01:58:38.100
and then, you know, if I just sit and take it, everything's distorted.

01:58:38.100 --> 01:58:43.100
And if I say anything, then I'm the bad guy for, you know,

01:58:43.100 --> 01:58:46.100
coming after something, which is not my intention at all.

01:58:46.100 --> 01:58:48.100
This, just for the record, is not.

01:58:48.100 --> 01:58:51.100
The video seems to seek to clarify certain points that were made,

01:58:51.100 --> 01:58:52.100
first being the employment one.

01:58:52.100 --> 01:58:56.100
Ethan states that they actually discussed this after the argument on episode 39,

01:58:56.100 --> 01:59:01.100
and Ethan had agreed to let Trisha bring on a producer to try and ease Trisha's discomfort with the current arrangements.

01:59:01.100 --> 01:59:06.100
So the day after we shot, after we had like broken up,

01:59:06.100 --> 01:59:13.100
we had a conversation for the first time ever about her wanting to hire new staff

01:59:13.100 --> 01:59:16.100
that she would look for and hire to work on Frenemies.

01:59:16.100 --> 01:59:19.100
That was the first time we had ever discussed that.

01:59:19.100 --> 01:59:22.100
And after talking it out with her, I agreed.

01:59:22.100 --> 01:59:24.100
I said, okay, we can, you know what?

01:59:24.100 --> 01:59:28.100
Again, because I just want to make everything smooth and manageable.

01:59:28.100 --> 01:59:31.100
We had this big blowout. We talked the evening afterwards.

01:59:31.100 --> 01:59:33.100
I said, you know what? Let's hire a producer.

01:59:33.100 --> 01:59:36.100
You tell me who you want to hire, and I'll hire him.

01:59:36.100 --> 01:59:40.100
His only stipulation was that the situation would be left to settle for a few days.

01:59:40.100 --> 01:59:43.100
However, the following day, he was blindsided by Trisha's video,

01:59:43.100 --> 01:59:46.100
which in his opinion undermined the agreements previously made

01:59:46.100 --> 01:59:48.100
and framed the situation uncharitably,

01:59:48.100 --> 01:59:53.100
especially given what Trisha had asked for initially was rather unreasonable and disrespectful in his mind.

01:59:53.100 --> 01:59:56.100
I don't know, from a business partner perspective and a friend perspective,

01:59:56.100 --> 01:59:58.100
that video really rubbed me the wrong way,

01:59:58.100 --> 02:00:04.100
because I woke up after having a conversation with her where I agreed that everything she wanted to do,

02:00:06.100 --> 02:00:12.100
and I wake up to her being like saying all this stuff about private conversations we had,

02:00:12.100 --> 02:00:19.100
and saying, oh, it's the crew's fault, people on the crew were unhappy, you know?

02:00:19.100 --> 02:00:26.100
And like, I don't know, I just felt like that video was just so unnecessary,

02:00:26.100 --> 02:00:32.100
and I just didn't get it, because I had done everything possible.

02:00:32.100 --> 02:00:36.100
He also clears up some misconceptions as to why the crew were reluctant to shoot the day after,

02:00:36.100 --> 02:00:38.100
citing that it wasn't due to Trisha's behaviour on set,

02:00:38.100 --> 02:00:41.100
but actually him feeding comments back to them about Trisha's requests,

02:00:41.100 --> 02:00:43.100
which he concedes was his fault,

02:00:43.100 --> 02:00:47.100
or with him taking the final decision to not shoot despite the crew's openness to do so.

02:00:47.100 --> 02:00:51.100
She told me that she wanted a whole new crew for Frenemies,

02:00:51.100 --> 02:00:53.100
because she didn't feel comfortable with them,

02:00:55.100 --> 02:00:56.100
she wanted a whole new space,

02:00:57.100 --> 02:00:58.100
she wanted a whole new crew,

02:01:02.100 --> 02:01:03.100
and it just...

02:01:06.100 --> 02:01:08.100
I don't know, it's like she couldn't meet me halfway.

02:01:08.100 --> 02:01:14.100
A whole new crew, we need to essentially fire everybody that's worked on this show from the beginning,

02:01:14.100 --> 02:01:18.100
find a new space, and change everything.

02:01:18.100 --> 02:01:21.100
This is where maybe I fucked up, okay?

02:01:21.100 --> 02:01:25.100
Is that I was talking to the crew, like, Trisha wants to,

02:01:25.100 --> 02:01:29.100
I was like, listen, Trisha wants to hire a new crew.

02:01:29.100 --> 02:01:32.100
When the crew found out she wanted to fire them all,

02:01:32.100 --> 02:01:38.100
they were, first of all, they've always been down to go work and do the shoot as we scheduled.

02:01:38.100 --> 02:01:45.100
They are good, loyal, you know, hardworking employees that are down to get the job done no matter what.

02:01:45.100 --> 02:01:50.100
I had done a temperature check, like, how do you guys feel about going to do this?

02:01:50.100 --> 02:01:54.100
Because there was some, there was just people like, you know,

02:01:54.100 --> 02:01:58.100
the vibe was like, Trisha wants to fire you guys and hire new people to do Frenemies.

02:01:58.100 --> 02:02:01.100
And also, do you want to go meet with her and shoot tomorrow?

02:02:01.100 --> 02:02:06.100
And so obviously, they were like, well, it's a little awkward, right?

02:02:06.100 --> 02:02:09.100
But, of course, I'm willing to do it.

02:02:09.100 --> 02:02:15.100
So I made the executive decision as their boss, trying to foster a healthy work environment,

02:02:15.100 --> 02:02:19.100
that let's just not do the shoot tomorrow, bearing everything that's happened,

02:02:19.100 --> 02:02:22.100
and take a few days to chill off.

02:02:22.100 --> 02:02:26.100
He states that Trisha's comments about certain things alongside DMs that were leaked

02:02:26.100 --> 02:02:29.100
had caused people to go out of their way to harass individuals who had not done anything wrong.

02:02:30.100 --> 02:02:32.100
He expresses solidarity for the people he works with,

02:02:32.100 --> 02:02:36.100
and reaffirms the stance that Trisha's behaviour was unprofessional in his eyes.

02:02:36.100 --> 02:02:38.100
I don't think it really matters whose idea it was.

02:02:38.100 --> 02:02:43.100
The fact that Trisha was just going to sit there and trash their work was kind of unacceptable to me,

02:02:43.100 --> 02:02:47.100
because ultimately, I have to create a safe work environment for my employees.

02:02:47.100 --> 02:02:50.100
And it's just kind of toxic to sit there and shit on their work.

02:02:50.100 --> 02:02:52.100
Whoever did it, it doesn't matter who did it.

02:02:52.100 --> 02:02:55.100
But the thing is, she keeps harping that in all of her videos to the point where

02:02:55.100 --> 02:02:59.100
not only is Sam now getting shit on on her social medias,

02:02:59.100 --> 02:03:01.100
people have gone out of their way and been like,

02:03:01.100 --> 02:03:03.100
you're the reason Frenemies is over,

02:03:03.100 --> 02:03:06.100
people are going to AB's wife,

02:03:06.100 --> 02:03:08.100
people are going to Dan's girlfriend,

02:03:08.100 --> 02:03:12.100
and just like random spit-firing shit at them

02:03:12.100 --> 02:03:15.100
with the chance that that's the person Trisha was talking about.

02:03:15.100 --> 02:03:18.100
And that's just, it's just not acceptable, you know.

02:03:18.100 --> 02:03:22.100
And this was part of a private conversation that she made public to try to justify

02:03:25.100 --> 02:03:26.100
why she wanted to leave the show.

02:03:26.100 --> 02:03:28.100
The crew did nothing wrong.

02:03:28.100 --> 02:03:30.100
I misunderstood the situation.

02:03:30.100 --> 02:03:33.100
I told Trisha that people were upset,

02:03:33.100 --> 02:03:35.100
that she didn't like this segment, okay?

02:03:35.100 --> 02:03:36.100
I take the blame for that.

02:03:36.100 --> 02:03:39.100
The reason they were upset that I misunderstood

02:03:39.100 --> 02:03:42.100
is because she said she wanted to fire them all.

02:03:42.100 --> 02:03:45.100
They were always willing to do their job, period.

02:03:45.100 --> 02:03:47.100
They have done nothing wrong.

02:03:47.100 --> 02:03:50.100
This is all fairly anecdotal, with his own perspective thrown in there.

02:03:50.100 --> 02:03:51.100
However, the tone changes to the next part,

02:03:51.100 --> 02:03:54.100
where he seems to address the inherent problem with how Frenemies have become.

02:03:54.100 --> 02:03:57.100
This idea that Ethan had become a quote emotional punching bag,

02:03:57.100 --> 02:04:00.100
and while he often had to show restraint in those moments,

02:04:00.100 --> 02:04:01.100
Trisha had free reign,

02:04:01.100 --> 02:04:03.100
a double standard in his mind that he lost patience for,

02:04:03.100 --> 02:04:06.100
venting many of his own frustrations surrounding Trisha's behaviour,

02:04:06.100 --> 02:04:08.100
including claims about their contributions,

02:04:08.100 --> 02:04:10.100
their conduct while they were creating content,

02:04:10.100 --> 02:04:12.100
and their nature to publicise drama.

02:04:12.100 --> 02:04:14.100
She called my wife like the C-word.

02:04:14.100 --> 02:04:17.100
She called me, you know, she said the most horrible thing.

02:04:17.100 --> 02:04:18.100
She said I'm a terrible parent.

02:04:18.100 --> 02:04:19.100
Hila's a terrible parent.

02:04:19.100 --> 02:04:21.100
And for me, it's like, okay.

02:04:21.100 --> 02:04:25.100
And I understand, again, that she has mental health,

02:04:25.100 --> 02:04:27.100
she has mental, like, health issues,

02:04:27.100 --> 02:04:30.100
but at the end of the day, it's just not,

02:04:30.100 --> 02:04:33.100
I don't feel like it's fair.

02:04:33.100 --> 02:04:35.100
Even though she has those issues, it's just,

02:04:35.100 --> 02:04:38.100
I can't be her emotional punching bag,

02:04:38.100 --> 02:04:41.100
and then the minute I speak up for myself,

02:04:41.100 --> 02:04:44.100
it turns into another, like, show-ending fight.

02:04:44.100 --> 02:04:46.100
It's just not a fair relationship.

02:04:46.100 --> 02:04:50.100
I texted her, trying to be mature and handle it personally,

02:04:50.100 --> 02:04:54.100
like, off the internet.

02:04:54.100 --> 02:04:57.100
I said, you know, I just want to be honest with you

02:04:57.100 --> 02:04:59.100
and say I felt it was really unfair

02:04:59.100 --> 02:05:02.100
how you put that video out, you know,

02:05:02.100 --> 02:05:05.100
after we worked to try to resolve this.

02:05:05.100 --> 02:05:07.100
And she ignores my texts,

02:05:07.100 --> 02:05:11.100
and she posts another 20-minute video 30 minutes later

02:05:11.100 --> 02:05:15.100
that was in response to my texts that was more like,

02:05:15.100 --> 02:05:17.100
oh, the crews, the reason why this happened,

02:05:17.100 --> 02:05:19.100
and sending even more hate to their fucking Instagrams.

02:05:19.100 --> 02:05:22.100
I don't have, I'm a patient man,

02:05:22.100 --> 02:05:24.100
but I'm not, like, superhuman.

02:05:24.100 --> 02:05:26.100
Another problem he communicates is Trisha's nature

02:05:26.100 --> 02:05:28.100
to not actually confront their problems.

02:05:28.100 --> 02:05:29.100
Now, we've known this for a while,

02:05:29.100 --> 02:05:31.100
but in this case, he shows that Trisha did not indicate

02:05:31.100 --> 02:05:32.100
there were any problems with ideas

02:05:32.100 --> 02:05:34.100
that they had subsequently trashed on the podcast

02:05:34.100 --> 02:05:36.100
and after the podcast,

02:05:36.100 --> 02:05:38.100
including that of the costume and the segment.

02:05:38.100 --> 02:05:40.100
And it's like, imagine how confusing it is,

02:05:40.100 --> 02:05:44.100
because she goes on the show, and she says,

02:05:44.100 --> 02:05:47.100
oh, this questions is so dumb.

02:05:47.100 --> 02:05:49.100
It's lazy. It's crap. I hate it.

02:05:49.100 --> 02:05:53.100
I mean, the day before, she retweeted it unprompted.

02:05:53.100 --> 02:05:55.100
I did not even ask her.

02:05:55.100 --> 02:06:01.100
That's just really, really difficult.

02:06:01.100 --> 02:06:04.100
Like, how much she hated the costumes.

02:06:04.100 --> 02:06:06.100
It was my idea. She never wanted to do it.

02:06:06.100 --> 02:06:07.100
She doesn't even know the character.

02:06:07.100 --> 02:06:10.100
She says, I never, I don't even know this character.

02:06:10.100 --> 02:06:13.100
I sent her this picture. I said, costume idea?

02:06:13.100 --> 02:06:15.100
She says, laugh my ass off.

02:06:15.100 --> 02:06:16.100
Oh my God. Oh my God.

02:06:16.100 --> 02:06:18.100
This is one of my all time favorite movies.

02:06:18.100 --> 02:06:20.100
Can we? I love her.

02:06:20.100 --> 02:06:22.100
I don't understand. What am I supposed to do?

02:06:22.100 --> 02:06:24.100
That's what I mean.

02:06:24.100 --> 02:06:26.100
It's like, I can't humanly do more.

02:06:26.100 --> 02:06:28.100
She expects superhuman care.

02:06:28.100 --> 02:06:30.100
He then continues to explain his justification

02:06:30.100 --> 02:06:32.100
between the 5% gap between shares

02:06:32.100 --> 02:06:33.100
and the profit from the podcast,

02:06:33.100 --> 02:06:35.100
something that he clearly feels

02:06:35.100 --> 02:06:37.100
he's been quite generous and transparent about.

02:06:37.100 --> 02:06:39.100
He addresses the DMs that Trisha shared,

02:06:39.100 --> 02:06:41.100
the investment he made on merchandise,

02:06:41.100 --> 02:06:43.100
with an escalating tone of exasperation,

02:06:43.100 --> 02:06:45.100
conveying the frustration at the investment he lost.

02:06:45.100 --> 02:06:47.100
We pay for the set.

02:06:47.100 --> 02:06:49.100
We rent the space. We film it.

02:06:49.100 --> 02:06:51.100
We use our equipment. We employ the people.

02:06:51.100 --> 02:06:53.100
We edit it. We upload it. We post it.

02:06:53.100 --> 02:06:55.100
We get that. Sponsors.

02:06:55.100 --> 02:06:57.100
We develop the concepts.

02:06:57.100 --> 02:06:59.100
We work all week to prep the segments.

02:06:59.100 --> 02:07:01.100
We pay for the insurance.

02:07:01.100 --> 02:07:03.100
We do the accounting and the payroll.

02:07:03.100 --> 02:07:05.100
I send her a fully itemized report every month

02:07:05.100 --> 02:07:07.100
of literally everything

02:07:07.100 --> 02:07:09.100
and how the expenses break down and her cut.

02:07:09.100 --> 02:07:11.100
And the fact that she would even accuse

02:07:11.100 --> 02:07:13.100
me of not being transparent is

02:07:13.100 --> 02:07:15.100
honestly very hurtful

02:07:15.100 --> 02:07:17.100
because I've gone so far out of my way

02:07:17.100 --> 02:07:19.100
to be as transparent

02:07:19.100 --> 02:07:21.100
as possible. I show her literally everything.

02:07:21.100 --> 02:07:23.100
And then she starts going,

02:07:23.100 --> 02:07:25.100
I want an itemized breakdown of how that

02:07:25.100 --> 02:07:27.100
5% is spent. And I'm like, dude,

02:07:27.100 --> 02:07:29.100
it's not like that. It's just

02:07:29.100 --> 02:07:31.100
a feat. It's a production feat.

02:07:31.100 --> 02:07:33.100
I'm not giving you an itemized deduction

02:07:33.100 --> 02:07:35.100
of the entire business.

02:07:35.100 --> 02:07:37.100
It's like

02:07:37.100 --> 02:07:39.100
these absolutely unreasonable,

02:07:39.100 --> 02:07:41.100
unimaginable bars

02:07:41.100 --> 02:07:43.100
that I could never reach.

02:07:43.100 --> 02:07:45.100
She posted a screenshot of herself calling me

02:07:45.100 --> 02:07:47.100
Julie.

02:07:47.100 --> 02:07:49.100
For wanting

02:07:49.100 --> 02:07:51.100
5% to cover the

02:07:51.100 --> 02:07:53.100
massiveness of this

02:07:53.100 --> 02:07:55.100
production. We spent $30,000

02:07:55.100 --> 02:07:57.100
buying all new equipment,

02:07:57.100 --> 02:07:59.100
cameras, switching board,

02:07:59.100 --> 02:08:01.100
audio equipment,

02:08:01.100 --> 02:08:03.100
microphones, everything

02:08:03.100 --> 02:08:05.100
so that we can continue to do it

02:08:05.100 --> 02:08:07.100
at the house for her. And she keeps

02:08:07.100 --> 02:08:09.100
bringing up this like, well, you get 5%.

02:08:09.100 --> 02:08:11.100
So you should be like, what is that for? You need to be

02:08:11.100 --> 02:08:13.100
paying. And I say, okay, you know what?

02:08:13.100 --> 02:08:15.100
Let's keep the show going. Let's do it

02:08:15.100 --> 02:08:17.100
at the house. I'm going to spend another

02:08:17.100 --> 02:08:19.100
$30,000 on the already

02:08:19.100 --> 02:08:21.100
$50,000 I spent on the set.

02:08:21.100 --> 02:08:23.100
Circles, we are splitting the 30%,

02:08:23.100 --> 02:08:25.100
which is typically our profit margin. It's like

02:08:25.100 --> 02:08:27.100
Trisha, just read what I wrote

02:08:27.100 --> 02:08:29.100
to you. The profit margin

02:08:29.100 --> 02:08:31.100
is 30%. I'm giving you

02:08:31.100 --> 02:08:33.100
half of the profits.

02:08:33.100 --> 02:08:35.100
Do you want 50% of all the

02:08:35.100 --> 02:08:37.100
revenue? Because I will lose money again.

02:08:37.100 --> 02:08:39.100
Apparently, you're the only one that's allowed to

02:08:39.100 --> 02:08:41.100
make money in this relationship.

02:08:41.100 --> 02:08:43.100
I really don't understand. Although he came into

02:08:43.100 --> 02:08:45.100
the video with peace and love, it kind of felt that

02:08:45.100 --> 02:08:47.100
mood waned after the first 20 minutes.

02:08:47.100 --> 02:08:49.100
If everything he's saying is true, then it's

02:08:49.100 --> 02:08:51.100
not hard to understand why he feels the way

02:08:51.100 --> 02:08:53.100
he does. But given what we know, it was not

02:08:53.100 --> 02:08:55.100
going to temper the situation. Every penny

02:08:55.100 --> 02:08:57.100
I've made from Frenemies, by the way, if she wants

02:08:57.100 --> 02:08:59.100
to talk about money, is tied up in this

02:08:59.100 --> 02:09:01.100
merch that doesn't come out for another month.

02:09:01.100 --> 02:09:03.100
I don't even know if we're going to

02:09:03.100 --> 02:09:05.100
sell. So it's like for all the complaining she

02:09:05.100 --> 02:09:07.100
does for money, she's the only one, as far as

02:09:07.100 --> 02:09:09.100
I'm concerned, that's actually making money from this thing.

02:09:09.100 --> 02:09:11.100
Because I've spent pretty much every fucking penny

02:09:11.100 --> 02:09:13.100
I've made from Frenemies into the show,

02:09:13.100 --> 02:09:15.100
on merch, into the own resources,

02:09:15.100 --> 02:09:17.100
buying more equipment for the fucking studio,

02:09:17.100 --> 02:09:19.100
building the set. It's like

02:09:19.100 --> 02:09:21.100
it's so easy for her to complain. She

02:09:21.100 --> 02:09:23.100
shows up, she gets a guaranteed check

02:09:23.100 --> 02:09:25.100
every fucking month,

02:09:25.100 --> 02:09:27.100
and I'm putting all

02:09:27.100 --> 02:09:29.100
my money on the line. And now, I have

02:09:29.100 --> 02:09:31.100
hundreds of thousands of dollars tied up in merch

02:09:31.100 --> 02:09:33.100
and I'm probably not going to be able to fucking sell,

02:09:33.100 --> 02:09:35.100
that my wife works super hard on,

02:09:35.100 --> 02:09:37.100
her staff works super hard on, and now it's like

02:09:37.100 --> 02:09:39.100
tough luck, dude. Trisha got paid

02:09:39.100 --> 02:09:41.100
and she's complaining about 5%. It blows

02:09:41.100 --> 02:09:43.100
my mind, and I'm upset about it.

02:09:43.100 --> 02:09:45.100
I am. I can't hide it. I just am.

02:09:45.100 --> 02:09:47.100
It's just not fair. 5%, when I'm

02:09:47.100 --> 02:09:49.100
literally not making a fucking penny

02:09:49.100 --> 02:09:51.100
at this point,

02:09:51.100 --> 02:09:53.100
it's just, it's just, it's just

02:09:53.100 --> 02:09:55.100
so disrespectful. It disregards

02:09:55.100 --> 02:09:57.100
all the hard work we do, not only

02:09:57.100 --> 02:09:59.100
on the crew, but now on my wife, and all the

02:09:59.100 --> 02:10:01.100
people that worked on the merch.

02:10:01.100 --> 02:10:03.100
It's like, okay, well, you know, fuck you.

02:10:03.100 --> 02:10:05.100
In a way, his own confusion may appear

02:10:05.100 --> 02:10:07.100
contradictory, because on the one hand,

02:10:07.100 --> 02:10:09.100
he expresses the fact that he did not want to overhaul

02:10:09.100 --> 02:10:11.100
the structure of the show to cater to Trisha's needs

02:10:11.100 --> 02:10:13.100
with the possibility that they could quit any minute.

02:10:13.100 --> 02:10:15.100
At the same time, he is still frustrated

02:10:15.100 --> 02:10:17.100
that he has lost all these investments, particularly

02:10:17.100 --> 02:10:19.100
on the merchandise front. I think it fundamentally

02:10:19.100 --> 02:10:21.100
comes down to trust. Although

02:10:21.100 --> 02:10:23.100
Ethan's vexation is to be expected,

02:10:23.100 --> 02:10:25.100
it was clear that he had still expected this to

02:10:25.100 --> 02:10:27.100
happen inevitably. He was the producer

02:10:27.100 --> 02:10:29.100
and the owner, and when you're in that position, you have

02:10:29.100 --> 02:10:31.100
to be prepared for someone to walk out on a project,

02:10:31.100 --> 02:10:33.100
and Ethan certainly expected as much.

02:10:33.100 --> 02:10:35.100
With this in mind, ending the podcast was

02:10:35.100 --> 02:10:37.100
probably for the best, and although visibly frustrated,

02:10:37.100 --> 02:10:39.100
he shows resolve in his final decision.

02:10:39.100 --> 02:10:41.100
I mean, we've gone out of our way

02:10:41.100 --> 02:10:43.100
in every imaginable way

02:10:43.100 --> 02:10:45.100
to make her feel welcome, accommodated, listened

02:10:45.100 --> 02:10:47.100
to, appreciated to, and

02:10:47.100 --> 02:10:49.100
the truth is

02:10:49.100 --> 02:10:51.100
that I'm very grateful for

02:10:51.100 --> 02:10:53.100
the experience we've had with Frenemies,

02:10:53.100 --> 02:10:55.100
and all the learning, and growing, and

02:10:55.100 --> 02:10:57.100
helping, and the amazing growth

02:10:57.100 --> 02:10:59.100
that our channel has seen as the result

02:10:59.100 --> 02:11:01.100
of that show. I mean, it's been

02:11:01.100 --> 02:11:03.100
popular and successful

02:11:03.100 --> 02:11:05.100
beyond what either of us anticipated.

02:11:05.100 --> 02:11:07.100
And I have so much

02:11:07.100 --> 02:11:09.100
to thank Trisha for.

02:11:09.100 --> 02:11:11.100
It is with a heavy heart, you know,

02:11:11.100 --> 02:11:13.100
that we end the show, and

02:11:15.100 --> 02:11:17.100
it sucks.

02:11:17.100 --> 02:11:19.100
It does suck, but

02:11:19.100 --> 02:11:21.100
you know what?

02:11:21.100 --> 02:11:23.100
Life goes on,

02:11:23.100 --> 02:11:25.100
right? We're not stopping,

02:11:25.100 --> 02:11:27.100
we're only getting started, and

02:11:27.100 --> 02:11:29.100
I'm sure that Trisha's got

02:11:29.100 --> 02:11:31.100
a lot of good stuff up her sleeve

02:11:31.100 --> 02:11:33.100
for you guys as well, so.

02:11:33.100 --> 02:11:35.100
However, Ethan's video did not sit well with Trisha,

02:11:35.100 --> 02:11:37.100
and maybe they felt offended by his expectations,

02:11:37.100 --> 02:11:39.100
maybe they didn't like the framing, but as always

02:11:39.100 --> 02:11:41.100
they responded, and what we received was

02:11:41.100 --> 02:11:43.100
a lot of content, but not a lot of substance.

02:11:43.100 --> 02:11:45.100
I'll add a little note here that when

02:11:45.100 --> 02:11:47.100
working on research, I was disappointed

02:11:47.100 --> 02:11:49.100
at reading a part one, as that meant

02:11:49.100 --> 02:11:51.100
there would be a part two. What I didn't account

02:11:51.100 --> 02:11:53.100
for was the part three, leaving

02:11:53.100 --> 02:11:55.100
these response videos at two hours and fifteen

02:11:55.100 --> 02:11:57.100
minutes in total.

02:12:13.100 --> 02:12:15.100
It's a clip and response style video where essentially

02:12:15.100 --> 02:12:17.100
Trisha replies to Ethan's points as he makes them in

02:12:17.100 --> 02:12:19.100
the video, but responding to the clips as they

02:12:19.100 --> 02:12:21.100
happen wasn't a good idea, because you need

02:12:21.100 --> 02:12:23.100
to know what points Ethan is at least going

02:12:23.100 --> 02:12:25.100
to make before you make your own points.

02:12:25.100 --> 02:12:27.100
Case in points?

02:12:41.100 --> 02:12:43.100
Here Trisha reasserts the idea that it's the crew that refused

02:12:43.100 --> 02:12:45.100
to film. Now with the DMs, we can see why

02:12:45.100 --> 02:12:47.100
Trisha may have received this impression. With the

02:12:47.100 --> 02:12:49.100
context that Ethan has provided, we now know

02:12:49.100 --> 02:12:51.100
that that's not the case, and he doesn't explicitly

02:12:51.100 --> 02:12:53.100
say that the crew was what was stopping them

02:12:53.100 --> 02:12:55.100
from filming, more that he thinks they shouldn't

02:12:55.100 --> 02:12:57.100
film given the situation with the crew.

02:12:57.100 --> 02:12:59.100
It's a misunderstanding, they happen,

02:12:59.100 --> 02:13:01.100
but there's no need to perpetuate it when it's

02:13:01.100 --> 02:13:03.100
cleared up, but these misunderstandings

02:13:03.100 --> 02:13:05.100
only go further unfortunately.

02:13:17.100 --> 02:13:45.100
I'm not going to dissect these videos the way I dissected Ethan's video, mainly because Trisha makes a lot of points they'd already made on other platforms, however I will try to give a brief outline.

02:13:47.100 --> 02:14:07.100
I think Trisha's video ultimately comes

02:14:07.100 --> 02:14:09.100
down to them wanting to step back because they

02:14:09.100 --> 02:14:11.100
fundamentally don't understand what they did

02:14:11.100 --> 02:14:13.100
wrong, and therefore unless they can come to some

02:14:13.100 --> 02:14:15.100
personal reconciliation, they can't compromise

02:14:15.100 --> 02:14:17.100
on the belief that they didn't act out of line.

02:14:17.100 --> 02:14:19.100
They don't think they're demanding, they don't think

02:14:19.100 --> 02:14:21.100
they're unreasonable, they're not trying to force

02:14:21.100 --> 02:14:23.100
people to walk on eggshells.

02:14:23.100 --> 02:14:25.100
But again, this kind of thing, I have to walk

02:14:25.100 --> 02:14:27.100
on eggshells with you, I have to keep you happy,

02:14:27.100 --> 02:14:29.100
that's not another reason I don't

02:14:29.100 --> 02:14:31.100
want to be there, I don't want that work environment,

02:14:31.100 --> 02:14:33.100
I'm trying to keep you happy, because I don't think

02:14:33.100 --> 02:14:35.100
I make that many demands.

02:14:35.100 --> 02:14:37.100
We don't, anything

02:14:37.100 --> 02:14:39.100
anything they've ever talked to me about

02:14:39.100 --> 02:14:41.100
I'm just like, yes, yes, yes.

02:14:41.100 --> 02:14:43.100
It's grown so

02:14:43.100 --> 02:14:45.100
much, and I'm obviously

02:14:45.100 --> 02:14:47.100
appreciative of everything he

02:14:47.100 --> 02:14:49.100
put in to start, but

02:14:49.100 --> 02:14:51.100
now that that's obviously

02:14:51.100 --> 02:14:53.100
recouped times a hundred, it's like, can we

02:14:53.100 --> 02:14:55.100
use some of it, like I get that you're still the

02:14:55.100 --> 02:14:57.100
producer, or whatever,

02:14:57.100 --> 02:14:59.100
but like can we use some of it towards

02:14:59.100 --> 02:15:01.100
you know, building

02:15:01.100 --> 02:15:03.100
this thing for like, us.

02:15:03.100 --> 02:15:05.100
They believed the fact that their cut went to production

02:15:05.100 --> 02:15:07.100
costs should have given them some sort of say in the

02:15:07.100 --> 02:15:09.100
actual business, and they felt Ethan was unfairly

02:15:09.100 --> 02:15:11.100
representing the tone of some of their

02:15:11.100 --> 02:15:13.100
gripes they had with the production. It's clear

02:15:13.100 --> 02:15:15.100
they wanted for enemies to become more independent

02:15:15.100 --> 02:15:17.100
from the H3 podcast, a commitment that Ethan

02:15:17.100 --> 02:15:19.100
didn't want to make, because as previously

02:15:19.100 --> 02:15:21.100
explored, he didn't have the belief that Trisha was

02:15:21.100 --> 02:15:23.100
going to stick around. The five percent is

02:15:23.100 --> 02:15:25.100
brought up, but Trisha also asserts this is in the

02:15:25.100 --> 02:15:27.100
context that H3 keeps a hundred percent of the

02:15:27.100 --> 02:15:29.100
highlights profit, something which Ethan doesn't

02:15:29.100 --> 02:15:31.100
mention in his response video.

02:15:31.100 --> 02:15:33.100
If some percentage is a hundred percent of the

02:15:33.100 --> 02:15:35.100
highlights and five percent of the thing is allowed,

02:15:35.100 --> 02:15:37.100
is allotted for staff, like it would be cool

02:15:37.100 --> 02:15:39.100
again, to get part time somebody,

02:15:39.100 --> 02:15:41.100
and if people are hiring their

02:15:41.100 --> 02:15:43.100
girlfriends, like why not hire my sister?

02:15:43.100 --> 02:15:45.100
She's like, amazing.

02:15:45.100 --> 02:15:47.100
From the beginning, he said a hundred percent of the highlights

02:15:47.100 --> 02:15:49.100
go towards production costs, so I thought

02:15:49.100 --> 02:15:51.100
that meant, let's get new buildings, let's get new

02:15:51.100 --> 02:15:53.100
sets, let's get, you know, because that initial

02:15:53.100 --> 02:15:55.100
investment of 37,000 is a lot,

02:15:55.100 --> 02:15:57.100
but now that we're like making it,

02:15:57.100 --> 02:15:59.100
because it's also money that

02:15:59.100 --> 02:16:01.100
I'm also contributing.

02:16:01.100 --> 02:16:03.100
Trisha does downplay their message to Ethan

02:16:03.100 --> 02:16:05.100
about the crew that they had unwittingly

02:16:05.100 --> 02:16:07.100
exposed the night before, but solidly contends

02:16:07.100 --> 02:16:09.100
this idea that they wanted the crew fired.

02:16:09.100 --> 02:16:11.100
You know,

02:16:11.100 --> 02:16:13.100
there was kind of like a non-starter,

02:16:13.100 --> 02:16:15.100
is she told me that she

02:16:15.100 --> 02:16:17.100
wanted a whole new crew for Frenemies

02:16:17.100 --> 02:16:19.100
because she didn't feel comfortable with them,

02:16:19.100 --> 02:16:21.100
she wanted

02:16:21.100 --> 02:16:23.100
a whole new space,

02:16:23.100 --> 02:16:25.100
she wanted a whole new crew.

02:16:25.100 --> 02:16:27.100
Okay, so, I honestly,

02:16:27.100 --> 02:16:29.100
I'm not saying this just to be gaslight, I really don't

02:16:29.100 --> 02:16:31.100
remember saying I want a whole new crew

02:16:31.100 --> 02:16:33.100
at all, I

02:16:33.100 --> 02:16:35.100
like, because I don't have any, I wouldn't

02:16:35.100 --> 02:16:37.100
have, because he's, the first thing he said to me when I wanted

02:16:37.100 --> 02:16:39.100
was like a producer for Frenemies, like to focus on

02:16:39.100 --> 02:16:41.100
Frenemies, he's like, who do you have in mind? I had someone right away.

02:16:41.100 --> 02:16:43.100
It wasn't a whole new crew to

02:16:43.100 --> 02:16:45.100
replace people, it was like, let's get a

02:16:45.100 --> 02:16:47.100
camera guy, like, for our one-off

02:16:47.100 --> 02:16:49.100
segments on the thing, and they don't do

02:16:49.100 --> 02:16:51.100
any of that, which is, again, fine, because they're very

02:16:51.100 --> 02:16:53.100
casual and relaxed, and they're all kind of like this like

02:16:53.100 --> 02:16:55.100
friend vibe, but it's like, it would be nice to

02:16:55.100 --> 02:16:57.100
have a producer to be able to like this, this, and this.

02:16:57.100 --> 02:16:59.100
One person I asked, I didn't say, fire

02:16:59.100 --> 02:17:01.100
the crew, I didn't, like, I've never

02:17:01.100 --> 02:17:03.100
ever said that.

02:17:03.100 --> 02:17:05.100
This is a real sticking point for Trisha, and in a

02:17:05.100 --> 02:17:07.100
way, it is almost a central narrative to

02:17:07.100 --> 02:17:09.100
understanding what exactly transpired, because

02:17:09.100 --> 02:17:11.100
Ethan obviously fed back that notion that

02:17:11.100 --> 02:17:13.100
Trisha wanted a new crew, and that was what

02:17:13.100 --> 02:17:15.100
provoked the response from them, that eventually

02:17:15.100 --> 02:17:17.100
led up to Trisha losing their call in the DMs

02:17:17.100 --> 02:17:19.100
and quitting the podcast the following morning.

02:17:19.100 --> 02:17:21.100
If Trisha didn't say that, then Ethan may well

02:17:21.100 --> 02:17:23.100
have unfairly framed comments they made,

02:17:23.100 --> 02:17:25.100
even if they weren't very pleasant to begin with.

02:17:25.100 --> 02:17:27.100
We know Trisha wanted someone in their corner,

02:17:27.100 --> 02:17:29.100
but that's different to a complete upheaval,

02:17:29.100 --> 02:17:31.100
and although the DMs certainly don't help their case,

02:17:31.100 --> 02:17:33.100
there is this unresolved detail that does decide

02:17:33.100 --> 02:17:35.100
the tone.

02:17:35.100 --> 02:17:37.100
I want to fire all of them, and get rid of them, and hire a new

02:17:37.100 --> 02:17:39.100
man, and it's like, okay, well that's not a starter for me.

02:17:39.100 --> 02:17:41.100
Fuck off, Ethan, fuck off, like this is exactly why I can't

02:17:41.100 --> 02:17:43.100
even talk to him, because he is, he's such a liar,

02:17:43.100 --> 02:17:45.100
and he's, like, this is such

02:17:45.100 --> 02:17:47.100
a lie, and that he keeps perpetuating

02:17:47.100 --> 02:17:49.100
this, this is what he keeps saying.

02:17:49.100 --> 02:17:51.100
I've never

02:17:51.100 --> 02:17:53.100
once said, let's fire the crew, never

02:17:53.100 --> 02:17:55.100
once said that, on my

02:17:55.100 --> 02:17:57.100
grave. Now I struggle to comment on this

02:17:57.100 --> 02:17:59.100
specifically, but going off the evidence, I can't

02:17:59.100 --> 02:18:01.100
say that Trisha wanted to fire the crew,

02:18:01.100 --> 02:18:03.100
and I don't think they said that explicitly, but

02:18:03.100 --> 02:18:05.100
I think given the comments that we have read, Ethan

02:18:05.100 --> 02:18:07.100
may well have interpreted it that way,

02:18:07.100 --> 02:18:09.100
especially given how they seem to demean the work the crew

02:18:09.100 --> 02:18:11.100
had done, and Trisha has a record of trying

02:18:11.100 --> 02:18:13.100
to push for a particular result without openly

02:18:13.100 --> 02:18:15.100
stating it, they were clearly unhappy with the

02:18:15.100 --> 02:18:17.100
current crew. Once again, it seems like a possible

02:18:17.100 --> 02:18:19.100
miscommunication that could be cleared up,

02:18:19.100 --> 02:18:21.100
but Trisha takes anything like that as a bad faith

02:18:21.100 --> 02:18:23.100
personal attack, and although I could understand

02:18:23.100 --> 02:18:25.100
why they would feel a bit taken out of context,

02:18:25.100 --> 02:18:27.100
this isn't a gossip forum, you're appealing to

02:18:27.100 --> 02:18:29.100
fans of the show, and if you want the audience to not

02:18:29.100 --> 02:18:31.100
view you through that cynical lens, then you have to

02:18:31.100 --> 02:18:33.100
at least lend some charity, especially with what

02:18:33.100 --> 02:18:35.100
you've said, but it's Trisha's choice,

02:18:35.100 --> 02:18:37.100
and after this point in particular, they're clearly

02:18:37.100 --> 02:18:39.100
driven to view Ethan as a liar and a manipulator.

02:18:43.100 --> 02:18:45.100
Trisha, you already did.

02:19:03.100 --> 02:19:09.100
Now, once again, here is where

02:19:09.100 --> 02:19:11.100
the uncharitable perspectives really go

02:19:11.100 --> 02:19:13.100
into gear. Trisha says if Ethan had a problem,

02:19:13.100 --> 02:19:15.100
then he should have ended the podcast, this may

02:19:15.100 --> 02:19:17.100
be a valid point, but you could also argue that

02:19:17.100 --> 02:19:19.100
he wasn't sure of the best way to de-escalate,

02:19:19.100 --> 02:19:21.100
and there's no guarantee that Trisha would have responded

02:19:21.100 --> 02:19:23.100
better to him ending the podcast early,

02:19:23.100 --> 02:19:25.100
regardless, it could have been a mistake on his part.

02:19:25.100 --> 02:19:27.100
However, Trisha interprets this as him wanting

02:19:27.100 --> 02:19:29.100
to get a rise out of them, and to have that

02:19:29.100 --> 02:19:31.100
dramatic walkout moment. Trisha believes

02:19:31.100 --> 02:19:33.100
that Ethan is weaponising their previous meltdowns

02:19:33.100 --> 02:19:35.100
by trying to use them to illustrate

02:19:35.100 --> 02:19:37.100
a double standard. As Trisha's perception of Ethan

02:19:37.100 --> 02:19:39.100
changes, their perception of the whole instant

02:19:39.100 --> 02:19:41.100
changes. Everything is now a manipulative

02:19:41.100 --> 02:19:43.100
tactic on Ethan's part.

02:19:43.100 --> 02:19:45.100
Ultimately, I have to create a safe work environment for my employees.

02:19:45.100 --> 02:19:47.100
So don't err. Why?

02:19:47.100 --> 02:19:49.100
Why? Oh my god.

02:19:49.100 --> 02:19:51.100
This is, it's so, but again, I don't care,

02:19:51.100 --> 02:19:53.100
people call me crazy, I'm used to it, call me crazy,

02:19:53.100 --> 02:19:55.100
it's so manipulative, like, I have to

02:19:55.100 --> 02:19:57.100
create a safe workplace for my employees, it's like,

02:19:57.100 --> 02:19:59.100
you're using this thing, like, I, you know what I mean,

02:19:59.100 --> 02:20:01.100
I mean, you're using these employees,

02:20:01.100 --> 02:20:03.100
I had, you said I disrespected them,

02:20:03.100 --> 02:20:05.100
that was the extent of the issue, like...

02:20:05.100 --> 02:20:07.100
I think the problem is that when Trisha

02:20:07.100 --> 02:20:09.100
vents, it's Trisha, it's what you expect,

02:20:09.100 --> 02:20:11.100
and yet when Ethan vents, it suddenly becomes a personal

02:20:11.100 --> 02:20:13.100
attack to them. I think there are some things that

02:20:13.100 --> 02:20:15.100
Ethan could have been clear about, maybe you could even

02:20:15.100 --> 02:20:17.100
say that as a large public creator, he shouldn't have

02:20:17.100 --> 02:20:19.100
said it, but it's not like I watched Ethan's

02:20:19.100 --> 02:20:21.100
video and didn't understand where he was coming

02:20:21.100 --> 02:20:23.100
from a human perspective. When you lose

02:20:23.100 --> 02:20:25.100
patience with someone, you might say these things

02:20:25.100 --> 02:20:27.100
publicly, and it's not like they come from an invalid

02:20:27.100 --> 02:20:29.100
place.

02:20:29.100 --> 02:20:31.100
...a piece of garbage that, like, I swear

02:20:31.100 --> 02:20:33.100
on my life, like, before this started, I was like, damn,

02:20:33.100 --> 02:20:35.100
I lost a really good friend, but you are such

02:20:35.100 --> 02:20:37.100
a liar, it's so fucked up

02:20:37.100 --> 02:20:39.100
to lie on that, that I, show

02:20:39.100 --> 02:20:41.100
me, like, show me a text where I'm like,

02:20:41.100 --> 02:20:43.100
fire the crew, a conversation, like, that's

02:20:43.100 --> 02:20:45.100
so fucked and twisted,

02:20:45.100 --> 02:20:47.100
just because I've had issues with them, just

02:20:47.100 --> 02:20:49.100
because I've said, like, I don't vibe with them, I don't like their sense

02:20:49.100 --> 02:20:51.100
of humor, I've never said fire

02:20:51.100 --> 02:20:53.100
people, are you fucking kidding me right now?

02:20:53.100 --> 02:20:55.100
Trisha has this concept of

02:20:55.100 --> 02:20:57.100
if you're not with them, you're against them.

02:20:57.100 --> 02:20:59.100
It's like a basic survival instinct, and they

02:20:59.100 --> 02:21:01.100
can't control themselves when responding to these

02:21:01.100 --> 02:21:03.100
videos, so any point of validity they may

02:21:03.100 --> 02:21:05.100
have, and I will try and make a case of them later,

02:21:05.100 --> 02:21:07.100
is lost amongst the anger that someone

02:21:07.100 --> 02:21:09.100
would ever say these things to you in the first place.

02:21:09.100 --> 02:21:11.100
I really...

02:21:11.100 --> 02:21:13.100
I really tried my

02:21:13.100 --> 02:21:15.100
best, like, obviously we have banter

02:21:15.100 --> 02:21:17.100
on the show, but, like, I really don't feel like

02:21:17.100 --> 02:21:19.100
I've been disrespectful,

02:21:19.100 --> 02:21:21.100
like, the idea of shooting that segment down,

02:21:21.100 --> 02:21:23.100
like, that was the disrespectful thing, like, yes, it

02:21:23.100 --> 02:21:25.100
was rude, I'm sorry about it, but, like,

02:21:25.100 --> 02:21:27.100
damn, like, the whole crew,

02:21:27.100 --> 02:21:29.100
you're making up lies, and I want them to be

02:21:29.100 --> 02:21:31.100
fired over that instance, and taking

02:21:31.100 --> 02:21:33.100
this thing that everyone's pissed at me about, and snowballing it,

02:21:33.100 --> 02:21:35.100
and creating this monster thing, and bringing this back up

02:21:35.100 --> 02:21:37.100
in my face, like,

02:21:37.100 --> 02:21:39.100
then why forgive me in the first place?

02:21:39.100 --> 02:21:41.100
Like, don't forgive me, like, just end it

02:21:41.100 --> 02:21:43.100
there. Trisha claims that they're in a pretty good

02:21:43.100 --> 02:21:45.100
place mentally, and they may well be comparatively,

02:21:45.100 --> 02:21:47.100
but they're not adjusted enough to the YouTube

02:21:47.100 --> 02:21:49.100
environment, and these videos are just proof

02:21:49.100 --> 02:21:51.100
of that. It sucks, because once again, I do believe

02:21:51.100 --> 02:21:53.100
I can make sense of Trisha's qualms,

02:21:53.100 --> 02:21:55.100
but these videos did not help.

02:21:55.100 --> 02:21:57.100
I feel like both Trisha and Ethan felt betrayed

02:21:57.100 --> 02:21:59.100
by each other, how Ethan views Trisha's nature

02:21:59.100 --> 02:22:01.100
to take everything public, and impose on reasonable

02:22:01.100 --> 02:22:03.100
standards, and how Trisha views Ethan's

02:22:03.100 --> 02:22:05.100
prejudice towards the situation, and how they

02:22:05.100 --> 02:22:07.100
feel they're trying to mislead their audience.

02:22:07.100 --> 02:22:09.100
Once betrayal becomes that central focus,

02:22:09.100 --> 02:22:11.100
these perspectives are only going to diverge

02:22:11.100 --> 02:22:13.100
further, which is exactly

02:22:13.100 --> 02:22:15.100
what happened next.

02:22:21.100 --> 02:22:25.100
...

02:22:25.100 --> 02:22:27.100
...

02:22:27.100 --> 02:22:29.100
...

02:22:29.100 --> 02:22:31.100
...

02:22:31.100 --> 02:22:33.100
...

02:22:33.100 --> 02:22:35.100
...

02:22:35.100 --> 02:22:37.100
...

02:22:37.100 --> 02:22:39.100
...

02:22:39.100 --> 02:22:41.100
...

02:22:41.100 --> 02:22:43.100
...

02:22:43.100 --> 02:22:45.100
...

02:22:45.100 --> 02:22:47.100
...

02:22:47.100 --> 02:22:49.100
...

02:22:49.100 --> 02:22:51.100
Trisha's videos aren't particularly helpful.

02:22:51.100 --> 02:22:53.100
I think the problem with this sort of content

02:22:53.100 --> 02:22:55.100
is that it focuses on a person's reaction

02:22:55.100 --> 02:22:57.100
in the moment, which when you're dealing with a

02:22:57.100 --> 02:22:59.100
dispute, is obviously going to be more heated

02:22:59.100 --> 02:23:01.100
than if you would give them time to see the bigger

02:23:01.100 --> 02:23:03.100
picture. However, one thing that you could at least

02:23:03.100 --> 02:23:05.100
say is that they were reactions, and therefore

02:23:05.100 --> 02:23:07.100
they should be taken with a pinch of salt,

02:23:07.100 --> 02:23:09.100
even if someone felt the drama was being played

02:23:09.100 --> 02:23:11.100
up by Trisha. They may have been overreactions,

02:23:11.100 --> 02:23:13.100
but they were reactions all the same.

02:23:13.100 --> 02:23:15.100
However, Trisha clearly felt like

02:23:15.100 --> 02:23:17.100
they hadn't quite made their point.

02:23:17.100 --> 02:23:19.100
After a couple days of what some may have

02:23:19.100 --> 02:23:21.100
hoped to be a return to regular content

02:23:21.100 --> 02:23:23.100
for them, Trisha once more uploaded another

02:23:23.100 --> 02:23:25.100
video. This time, though, it wasn't a reaction

02:23:25.100 --> 02:23:27.100
or a response. In fact, its title

02:23:27.100 --> 02:23:29.100
appeared to imply something much more serious,

02:23:29.100 --> 02:23:31.100
with a trigger warning clearly expressed in the

02:23:31.100 --> 02:23:33.100
title. What is the video about itself?

02:23:33.100 --> 02:23:35.100
I put up

02:23:35.100 --> 02:23:37.100
with Ethan purposely

02:23:37.100 --> 02:23:39.100
trying to trigger me

02:23:39.100 --> 02:23:41.100
on multiple occasions.

02:23:41.100 --> 02:23:43.100
I always put up with the triggers,

02:23:43.100 --> 02:23:45.100
and I allowed myself to be triggered

02:23:45.100 --> 02:23:47.100
um,

02:23:47.100 --> 02:23:49.100
and this is beyond, this is not

02:23:49.100 --> 02:23:51.100
walking on eggshells. It's like, oh, I say one wrong

02:23:51.100 --> 02:23:53.100
thing. No, no, no. This is times where I'm like,

02:23:53.100 --> 02:23:55.100
don't share the private messages from episode one

02:23:55.100 --> 02:23:57.100
where he shared messages I sent to him,

02:23:57.100 --> 02:23:59.100
where he shared Moses' private

02:23:59.100 --> 02:24:01.100
messages, and we ask him on the show

02:24:01.100 --> 02:24:03.100
not to. Well, as it's a Trisha

02:24:03.100 --> 02:24:05.100
video, there are a fair few clashing narratives.

02:24:05.100 --> 02:24:07.100
However, the one I'd say is probably

02:24:07.100 --> 02:24:09.100
the most prominent here is that Trisha believes they

02:24:09.100 --> 02:24:11.100
were much more lenient than Ethan gave them

02:24:11.100 --> 02:24:13.100
credit for, despite the fact that they believe Ethan

02:24:13.100 --> 02:24:15.100
attempted to rattle them up on multiple occasions.

02:24:15.100 --> 02:24:17.100
They believe their hand was forced by Ethan's

02:24:17.100 --> 02:24:19.100
persistent provocation, listing a few examples.

02:24:19.100 --> 02:24:21.100
A fair few of these seem to be rather

02:24:21.100 --> 02:24:23.100
insignificant, but the main incident seems

02:24:23.100 --> 02:24:25.100
to resolve around a trip that Ethan, Hila, Trisha,

02:24:25.100 --> 02:24:27.100
and their family took to Disney. This was

02:24:27.100 --> 02:24:29.100
recorded and uploaded in vlog form to

02:24:29.100 --> 02:24:31.100
the H3 Podcast channel, and it was

02:24:31.100 --> 02:24:33.100
pretty well received at the time. However, Trisha

02:24:33.100 --> 02:24:35.100
seems rather perturbed by a comment Ethan made

02:24:35.100 --> 02:24:37.100
during this trip about an incident they had also

02:24:37.100 --> 02:24:39.100
briefly spoken about on the podcast.

02:24:39.100 --> 02:24:41.100
I want to talk about it. The first things that come to

02:24:41.100 --> 02:24:43.100
mind obviously are talking to my mom

02:24:43.100 --> 02:24:45.100
about my sexual assault on

02:24:45.100 --> 02:24:47.100
a trip from Disneyland, a trip

02:24:47.100 --> 02:24:49.100
that my mom, sister, and Moses had planned for my birthday

02:24:49.100 --> 02:24:51.100
and then we did invite

02:24:51.100 --> 02:24:53.100
Ethan and Hila to come

02:24:53.100 --> 02:24:55.100
willingly and graciously because I

02:24:55.100 --> 02:24:57.100
I enjoyed

02:24:57.100 --> 02:24:59.100
spending time with them there, you know.

02:24:59.100 --> 02:25:01.100
Okay, let me at least explain myself.

02:25:01.100 --> 02:25:03.100
No! Let me at least explain

02:25:03.100 --> 02:25:05.100
myself. Okay.

02:25:05.100 --> 02:25:07.100
We're on the party bus, and

02:25:07.100 --> 02:25:09.100
I, we all got our own pizzas.

02:25:09.100 --> 02:25:11.100
I had my, you know, I love the

02:25:11.100 --> 02:25:13.100
pineapple, uh,

02:25:13.100 --> 02:25:15.100
black olive, uh, nobody

02:25:15.100 --> 02:25:17.100
else wanted it, so I started picking the cheese

02:25:17.100 --> 02:25:19.100
off. Okay? And I was

02:25:19.100 --> 02:25:21.100
just eating the toppings, and the pizza looked like

02:25:21.100 --> 02:25:23.100
a burn victim, it was all disgusting.

02:25:23.100 --> 02:25:25.100
So anyway, you looked at it and you're like, that is so

02:25:25.100 --> 02:25:27.100
disgusting, I can't look at it, like that's just the

02:25:27.100 --> 02:25:29.100
grossest thing I've ever seen. Yeah, it was really gross, I

02:25:29.100 --> 02:25:31.100
physically had to lay down after it. And I said,

02:25:31.100 --> 02:25:33.100
I said, Trisha, who are

02:25:33.100 --> 02:25:35.100
you to talk about gross

02:25:35.100 --> 02:25:37.100
things? You've shoved a candlestick

02:25:37.100 --> 02:25:39.100
up your ass. Uh-huh. But the reason

02:25:39.100 --> 02:25:41.100
I said it is because they

02:25:41.100 --> 02:25:43.100
literally know everything

02:25:43.100 --> 02:25:45.100
about this show. Why would I? Which

02:25:45.100 --> 02:25:47.100
means that I know that they

02:25:47.100 --> 02:25:49.100
know the meme. It's not something they want to talk about

02:25:49.100 --> 02:25:51.100
or you want to bring up in front of your family. Okay, fine, fine, fine,

02:25:51.100 --> 02:25:53.100
but like, well, they were looking

02:25:53.100 --> 02:25:55.100
at me like, ugh,

02:25:55.100 --> 02:25:57.100
okay, maybe I fucked up.

02:25:57.100 --> 02:25:59.100
Alongside the other

02:25:59.100 --> 02:26:01.100
examples, it feels like Trisha is having one

02:26:01.100 --> 02:26:03.100
of their revelations in rationalizing

02:26:03.100 --> 02:26:05.100
their own behavior, crafting this narrative

02:26:05.100 --> 02:26:07.100
that their reaction was actually the result of continuous

02:26:07.100 --> 02:26:09.100
comments and incidents that they failed to

02:26:09.100 --> 02:26:11.100
address themselves, and therefore let boil over

02:26:11.100 --> 02:26:13.100
in the eventual meltdown that occurred in that

02:26:13.100 --> 02:26:15.100
fateful episode. However, one really has to

02:26:15.100 --> 02:26:17.100
question what motivated them to use such a

02:26:17.100 --> 02:26:19.100
provocative title, when the topic, although

02:26:19.100 --> 02:26:21.100
somewhat sensitive, isn't exactly communicated

02:26:21.100 --> 02:26:23.100
with the same sense of pertinence to the actual

02:26:23.100 --> 02:26:25.100
subject being discussed. I'm not trying to say a

02:26:25.100 --> 02:26:27.100
trigger warning was unnecessary, or that it makes

02:26:27.100 --> 02:26:29.100
any discourse of it less valid, but in the

02:26:29.100 --> 02:26:31.100
established canon of Trisha's upload history on

02:26:31.100 --> 02:26:33.100
Frenemies, the video advertises itself as much

02:26:33.100 --> 02:26:35.100
more serious than other content that they have produced

02:26:35.100 --> 02:26:37.100
on this specific matter, despite the fact that this

02:26:37.100 --> 02:26:39.100
was once more an analysis of the often fractured

02:26:39.100 --> 02:26:41.100
dynamic between the two. However, it is

02:26:41.100 --> 02:26:43.100
a bit more accusatory given that Trisha alleges

02:26:43.100 --> 02:26:45.100
that Ethan's provocation of them was intentional.

02:26:45.100 --> 02:26:47.100
Like, all of that was like

02:26:47.100 --> 02:26:49.100
triggers, right? When I asked to the very last

02:26:49.100 --> 02:26:51.100
episode, like, we need to stop, we need

02:26:51.100 --> 02:26:53.100
to stop, and he's like, yes, you can go up and leave

02:26:53.100 --> 02:26:55.100
whenever you want, you know what I mean? Like, up until

02:26:55.100 --> 02:26:57.100
even that point, he wanted me to do that thing, and

02:26:57.100 --> 02:26:59.100
I'm like, I just want to end this. This represents

02:26:59.100 --> 02:27:01.100
this increasingly cynical perspective

02:27:01.100 --> 02:27:03.100
that each party held of each other, and in his

02:27:03.100 --> 02:27:05.100
response, Ethan followed suit. Now,

02:27:05.100 --> 02:27:07.100
given his relevance to the situation, it's

02:27:07.100 --> 02:27:09.100
no surprise that Ethan wasn't too flattered

02:27:09.100 --> 02:27:11.100
by how the video was publicised.

02:27:11.100 --> 02:27:13.100
However, he decided to go one step further, stating

02:27:13.100 --> 02:27:15.100
that Trisha's video on the matter goes as

02:27:15.100 --> 02:27:17.100
far to accuse him of sexual harassment,

02:27:17.100 --> 02:27:19.100
specifically referring to the comments

02:27:19.100 --> 02:27:21.100
that Trisha made about his commentary on their new

02:27:21.100 --> 02:27:23.100
skin product.

02:27:23.100 --> 02:27:25.100
And then up until, like, the last

02:27:25.100 --> 02:27:27.100
episode, like, everyone was like, it's clear Trisha

02:27:27.100 --> 02:27:29.100
was in a bad mood, but

02:27:29.100 --> 02:27:31.100
it was a lot of things from sexualising

02:27:31.100 --> 02:27:33.100
my skincare product, like, you know, I was just like

02:27:33.100 --> 02:27:35.100
that, I was like, you know,

02:27:35.100 --> 02:27:37.100
because it's not just my line.

02:27:37.100 --> 02:27:39.100
I would stop short of saying that Trish was trying to

02:27:39.100 --> 02:27:41.100
accuse him of sexual harassment, but I also don't

02:27:41.100 --> 02:27:43.100
really understand why Ethan's observation

02:27:43.100 --> 02:27:45.100
had to be construed as sexual, as they

02:27:45.100 --> 02:27:47.100
say in the episode, it's childish humour,

02:27:47.100 --> 02:27:49.100
seeing something perhaps rude in an otherwise

02:27:49.100 --> 02:27:51.100
unassuming scene.

02:27:51.100 --> 02:27:53.100
This is the secret, I'm so happy to finally

02:27:53.100 --> 02:27:55.100
Also kind of phallic. What?

02:27:55.100 --> 02:27:57.100
You say, Trish, what's the secret? And then you show

02:27:57.100 --> 02:27:59.100
It looks like a cock, balls

02:27:59.100 --> 02:28:01.100
and cock. What are you talking about?

02:28:01.100 --> 02:28:03.100
Look, two balls and a cock, it's like

02:28:03.100 --> 02:28:05.100
a giant phallic. Oh my god, it's the

02:28:05.100 --> 02:28:07.100
products in the thing. Bro, it's literally

02:28:07.100 --> 02:28:09.100
a penis.

02:28:09.100 --> 02:28:11.100
You are so, so

02:28:11.100 --> 02:28:13.100
annihilated. With that in mind, I can

02:28:13.100 --> 02:28:15.100
understand why Ethan feels like he's being misrepresented.

02:28:15.100 --> 02:28:17.100
How the draw towards a discussion

02:28:17.100 --> 02:28:19.100
surrounding the semantics of sexual harassment

02:28:19.100 --> 02:28:21.100
feels a bit sudden, and Trisha once

02:28:21.100 --> 02:28:23.100
more jumps on that to quickly defend themselves

02:28:23.100 --> 02:28:25.100
and say they weren't accusing anyone of such

02:28:25.100 --> 02:28:27.100
a claim. Harking on Ethan's previous comments

02:28:27.100 --> 02:28:29.100
about them wanting to fire the crew suggests

02:28:29.100 --> 02:28:31.100
that he has a bit of a habit of strawmanning

02:28:31.100 --> 02:28:33.100
Trisha's comments. At this point, Trisha

02:28:33.100 --> 02:28:35.100
and Ethan couldn't even agree on what each other

02:28:35.100 --> 02:28:37.100
were saying, but some felt like Trisha blurred the

02:28:37.100 --> 02:28:39.100
line in their comments with the intent of taking advantage

02:28:39.100 --> 02:28:41.100
of Ethan's defensive response, while critics

02:28:41.100 --> 02:28:43.100
of Ethan thought he was trying to stir up emotion against

02:28:43.100 --> 02:28:45.100
Trisha by making their claim seem stronger than

02:28:45.100 --> 02:28:47.100
they were. Ethan

02:28:47.100 --> 02:28:49.100
incidentally invited

02:28:49.100 --> 02:28:51.100
himself to

02:28:51.100 --> 02:28:53.100
our family's surprise.

02:28:53.100 --> 02:28:55.100
And

02:28:55.100 --> 02:28:57.100
we paid

02:28:57.100 --> 02:28:59.100
for him. Ethan and Hila did not

02:28:59.100 --> 02:29:01.100
pay for their VIP ticket to Disneyland.

02:29:01.100 --> 02:29:03.100
We ended up

02:29:03.100 --> 02:29:05.100
paying for Ethan and Hila,

02:29:05.100 --> 02:29:07.100
which is crazy

02:29:07.100 --> 02:29:09.100
because he takes that 5%

02:29:09.100 --> 02:29:11.100
and VIP tickets

02:29:11.100 --> 02:29:13.100
to Disneyland is not cheap.

02:29:13.100 --> 02:29:15.100
And I don't know why he felt compelled

02:29:15.100 --> 02:29:17.100
to ask me

02:29:17.100 --> 02:29:19.100
and my mom or bring it up

02:29:19.100 --> 02:29:21.100
in the situation that

02:29:21.100 --> 02:29:23.100
how we felt about her

02:29:23.100 --> 02:29:25.100
having a candlestick

02:29:25.100 --> 02:29:27.100
up her you know what

02:29:27.100 --> 02:29:29.100
it made us very uncomfortable, especially

02:29:29.100 --> 02:29:31.100
we had just such a fun day

02:29:31.100 --> 02:29:33.100
and

02:29:33.100 --> 02:29:35.100
it was really disgusting.

02:29:35.100 --> 02:29:37.100
I think that he wanted

02:29:37.100 --> 02:29:39.100
the shock value, but I think that

02:29:39.100 --> 02:29:41.100
he forgets that we're

02:29:41.100 --> 02:29:43.100
family at the end of the day

02:29:43.100 --> 02:29:45.100
and I was not appreciative

02:29:45.100 --> 02:29:47.100
of that. The next few days though

02:29:47.100 --> 02:29:49.100
were just pure chaos. Trisha's sister

02:29:49.100 --> 02:29:51.100
decided to weigh in, supporting Trisha's statement

02:29:51.100 --> 02:29:53.100
and alleging that Ethan and Hila invited

02:29:53.100 --> 02:29:55.100
themselves to Disney and had their tickets paid

02:29:55.100 --> 02:29:57.100
for. Ethan then responds to this sister

02:29:57.100 --> 02:29:59.100
Carly on the After Dark podcast,

02:29:59.100 --> 02:30:01.100
trying to take a more jocular outlook on the whole

02:30:01.100 --> 02:30:03.100
situation, but still visibly irritated.

02:30:03.100 --> 02:30:05.100
And to be honest with you guys,

02:30:05.100 --> 02:30:07.100
I'm just trying to make the best

02:30:07.100 --> 02:30:09.100
of this situation that is quite

02:30:09.100 --> 02:30:11.100
sour to be frank.

02:30:11.100 --> 02:30:13.100
And so, I watched this

02:30:13.100 --> 02:30:15.100
with peace and love. So she's

02:30:15.100 --> 02:30:17.100
first of all saying we invited ourselves

02:30:17.100 --> 02:30:19.100
for a surprise party.

02:30:19.100 --> 02:30:21.100
This is where

02:30:21.100 --> 02:30:23.100
it's just so frustrating for me.

02:30:23.100 --> 02:30:25.100
You know, we obviously

02:30:25.100 --> 02:30:27.100
didn't invite ourselves.

02:30:27.100 --> 02:30:29.100
We were invited,

02:30:29.100 --> 02:30:31.100
as Trisha even says in her

02:30:31.100 --> 02:30:33.100
video. It's like they can't even keep their stories

02:30:33.100 --> 02:30:35.100
straight. Trisha then responds to H3

02:30:35.100 --> 02:30:37.100
calling them out for this and saying that the sister

02:30:37.100 --> 02:30:39.100
isn't involved, but also being sufficiently

02:30:39.100 --> 02:30:41.100
passive aggressive to boot, and it just felt like

02:30:41.100 --> 02:30:43.100
this endless cycle of people trying to have the

02:30:43.100 --> 02:30:45.100
final word. When everyone wants the final word,

02:30:45.100 --> 02:30:47.100
no one's gonna have it.

02:30:47.100 --> 02:30:49.100
Ethan has this thing where he punched down on people, right?

02:30:49.100 --> 02:30:51.100
Like, he obviously knows he has a really loyal

02:30:51.100 --> 02:30:53.100
fanbase, and they're a really loud fanbase.

02:30:53.100 --> 02:30:55.100
I'm obviously the one getting all the hate. They see

02:30:55.100 --> 02:30:57.100
that. So for them to do this video like defending themselves

02:30:57.100 --> 02:30:59.100
when I'm the one getting all the hate, it's like

02:30:59.100 --> 02:31:01.100
it's really just punching down. It's just punching, punching,

02:31:01.100 --> 02:31:03.100
punching when it's low. My sister deleted that TikTok

02:31:03.100 --> 02:31:05.100
within an hour. Trisha's newest video

02:31:05.100 --> 02:31:07.100
had further sought to justify their own perspective by

02:31:07.100 --> 02:31:09.100
making Ethan look more unreasonable than he

02:31:09.100 --> 02:31:11.100
believed himself to be. Allegations that

02:31:11.100 --> 02:31:13.100
although he tried to laugh at, he clearly construed

02:31:13.100 --> 02:31:15.100
as very serious, and similarly hit back

02:31:15.100 --> 02:31:17.100
at Trisha, and as they took to social media

02:31:17.100 --> 02:31:19.100
to relentlessly attack each other, it began to

02:31:19.100 --> 02:31:21.100
feel like there may be no way back.

02:31:21.100 --> 02:31:23.100
However, if one fact is indisputable,

02:31:23.100 --> 02:31:25.100
Trisha is consistently

02:31:25.100 --> 02:31:27.100
inconsistent, and although that would

02:31:27.100 --> 02:31:29.100
once again change their tone,

02:31:29.100 --> 02:31:31.100
this time, it didn't quite

02:31:31.100 --> 02:31:33.100
heal the wound.

02:31:35.100 --> 02:31:37.100
With each of Trisha's videos,

02:31:37.100 --> 02:31:39.100
it felt strange, because in spite of the fact that they were

02:31:39.100 --> 02:31:41.100
clearly unhappy with Ethan Klein, there also

02:31:41.100 --> 02:31:43.100
appeared to be this expectation that by the

02:31:43.100 --> 02:31:45.100
next Tuesday, they'd be back at the studio,

02:31:45.100 --> 02:31:47.100
and this would all be water under the bridge.

02:31:47.100 --> 02:31:49.100
Trisha even eludes to this themself in a tweet,

02:31:49.100 --> 02:31:51.100
one which Ethan very quickly rebuked.

02:31:51.100 --> 02:31:53.100
I'm not a subscriber to the school of philosophy

02:31:53.100 --> 02:31:55.100
that believed Trisha was only upset about the money,

02:31:55.100 --> 02:31:57.100
and it's not that I don't think there were no legitimate

02:31:57.100 --> 02:31:59.100
qualms, but it felt like Trisha's videos

02:31:59.100 --> 02:32:01.100
from a certain point were designed to elicit a

02:32:01.100 --> 02:32:03.100
reaction from Ethan, and I don't think they did

02:32:03.100 --> 02:32:05.100
because they loathed Ethan or they wanted to hurt

02:32:05.100 --> 02:32:07.100
him. I think it's because they almost wanted to play

02:32:07.100 --> 02:32:09.100
out the situation so that there could be some

02:32:09.100 --> 02:32:11.100
degree of mutual responsibility spread

02:32:11.100 --> 02:32:13.100
to the point where they would be inclined to

02:32:13.100 --> 02:32:15.100
patch it up on the podcast.

02:32:15.100 --> 02:32:17.100
Although leaving with the usual fireworks, it's

02:32:17.100 --> 02:32:19.100
clear that Trisha still had a part of them tied

02:32:19.100 --> 02:32:21.100
to the podcast, even at one point starting

02:32:21.100 --> 02:32:23.100
their own show called Enemies, which as you can

02:32:23.100 --> 02:32:25.100
assume was Frenemies without Ethan,

02:32:25.100 --> 02:32:27.100
something they referred to a few times.

02:32:27.100 --> 02:32:29.100
So, yeah, this is the podcast

02:32:29.100 --> 02:32:31.100
Enemies, so I just

02:32:31.100 --> 02:32:33.100
make enemies, because

02:32:33.100 --> 02:32:35.100
that's just what I do, and I guess

02:32:35.100 --> 02:32:37.100
I own up to it.

02:32:37.600 --> 02:32:39.600
I actually don't want enemies. I will speak the

02:32:39.600 --> 02:32:41.600
same truth I spoke on Frenemies, but people

02:32:41.600 --> 02:32:43.600
don't care if there's not a man next to me.

02:32:43.600 --> 02:32:45.600
And that's just the world we live in.

02:32:45.600 --> 02:32:47.600
I'm not trying to be over here like a feminist, whatever.

02:32:47.600 --> 02:32:49.600
I'm fine with that. I'm happy to leech on to

02:32:49.600 --> 02:32:51.600
another dude for my next

02:32:51.600 --> 02:32:53.600
venture. That's just how it has to

02:32:53.600 --> 02:32:55.600
be if my voice is going to be heard.

02:32:55.600 --> 02:32:57.600
I have an apology to

02:32:57.600 --> 02:32:59.600
Ethan and the staff

02:32:59.600 --> 02:33:01.600
coming out this week.

02:33:01.600 --> 02:33:03.600
Ethan.

02:33:03.600 --> 02:33:05.600
Go watch

02:33:05.600 --> 02:33:07.600
Frenemies. I support

02:33:07.600 --> 02:33:09.600
him having a new co-host

02:33:09.600 --> 02:33:11.600
or co-hosts if he has multiple.

02:33:11.600 --> 02:33:13.600
We had ad reads for the whole year, so

02:33:13.600 --> 02:33:15.600
you know, get that bag, get that coin.

02:33:15.600 --> 02:33:17.600
In the past, this sort of outburst

02:33:17.600 --> 02:33:19.600
had motivated Ethan to bring on Dr. Drew,

02:33:19.600 --> 02:33:21.600
discuss their differences, and find some

02:33:21.600 --> 02:33:23.600
sort of compromise on how to move forward,

02:33:23.600 --> 02:33:25.600
something that once again Trisha references

02:33:25.600 --> 02:33:27.600
in one of their response videos. However, this time

02:33:27.600 --> 02:33:29.600
Ethan didn't really change his tune, and wasn't

02:33:29.600 --> 02:33:31.600
interested in resolving any differences between

02:33:31.600 --> 02:33:33.600
himself and Trisha with their relationship in the

02:33:33.600 --> 02:33:35.600
state that it was. In less than 24 hours

02:33:35.600 --> 02:33:37.600
after the launch of Trisha's new podcast, where

02:33:37.600 --> 02:33:39.600
they take multiple jabs at Ethan, there is

02:33:39.600 --> 02:33:41.600
once more a change of message.

02:34:03.600 --> 02:34:29.600
Yes. In this video

02:34:29.600 --> 02:34:31.600
called Apology to Ethan, Trisha reveals

02:34:31.600 --> 02:34:33.600
that they've been taking better care of

02:34:33.600 --> 02:34:35.600
themselves, and have come to the conclusion that they

02:34:35.600 --> 02:34:37.600
actually have some apologising to do.

02:34:37.600 --> 02:34:39.600
Fantastic.

02:35:01.600 --> 02:35:19.600
After a rather meandering menaces

02:35:19.600 --> 02:35:21.600
of their mental health, they speak about how

02:35:21.600 --> 02:35:23.600
much they have messed up. They don't really speak about

02:35:23.600 --> 02:35:25.600
too many of the issues in depth, but they try

02:35:25.600 --> 02:35:27.600
to elaborate on their mindset, and how this

02:35:27.600 --> 02:35:29.600
impacted their behaviour towards the clients,

02:35:29.600 --> 02:35:31.600
and how they felt responsible for sabotaging

02:35:31.600 --> 02:35:33.600
the podcast because of their feelings. Of the

02:35:33.600 --> 02:35:35.600
incidents in question, they do apologise for the

02:35:35.600 --> 02:35:37.600
distasteful jokes they made in the DMs that they

02:35:37.600 --> 02:35:39.600
leaked. They also apologise for not going to Ethan

02:35:39.600 --> 02:35:41.600
privately, and just generally their demeanour in

02:35:41.600 --> 02:35:43.600
how it impacted those around them. Frame those

02:35:43.600 --> 02:35:45.600
actions as ones yielded from an unhealthy

02:35:45.600 --> 02:35:47.600
mindset.

02:35:59.600 --> 02:36:01.600
I see exactly

02:36:01.600 --> 02:36:03.600
how it came

02:36:03.600 --> 02:36:05.600
across, and I see it very clearly

02:36:05.600 --> 02:36:07.600
and I'm so embarrassed

02:36:07.600 --> 02:36:09.600
because, again, I'm

02:36:09.600 --> 02:36:11.600
a mess. I'm a messy person. I'm drama.

02:36:11.600 --> 02:36:13.600
I have issues, as everyone

02:36:13.600 --> 02:36:15.600
does, but I've always prided myself

02:36:15.600 --> 02:36:17.600
on being a nice person.

02:36:17.600 --> 02:36:19.600
I apologise for bringing up money. I apologise

02:36:19.600 --> 02:36:21.600
for just really, again, poor

02:36:21.600 --> 02:36:23.600
communication. I feel like I've worked on communication

02:36:23.600 --> 02:36:25.600
so much in my relationship that I've neglected

02:36:25.600 --> 02:36:27.600
to work on communication on

02:36:27.600 --> 02:36:29.600
other ways, like speaking up when

02:36:29.600 --> 02:36:31.600
even little things, speaking up if I don't like

02:36:31.600 --> 02:36:33.600
something or don't think, you know, I'm such a hype person

02:36:33.600 --> 02:36:35.600
I like to, like, hype everything. I love it,

02:36:35.600 --> 02:36:37.600
love it, love it, and then, like, it got me in trouble

02:36:37.600 --> 02:36:39.600
with Nikocado and I was like, yes, let's hang out

02:36:39.600 --> 02:36:41.600
and then I hype, hype, hype, and then ghost because

02:36:41.600 --> 02:36:43.600
I love to hype. I don't ever

02:36:43.600 --> 02:36:45.600
like to shoot down ideas. I don't, you know what I mean, but

02:36:45.600 --> 02:36:47.600
I really need to

02:36:47.600 --> 02:36:49.600
be better at communicating when I don't

02:36:49.600 --> 02:36:51.600
like something. I don't want to do something and just be

02:36:51.600 --> 02:36:53.600
better at it and just grow a pair

02:36:53.600 --> 02:36:55.600
of balls and talk about it.

02:36:55.600 --> 02:36:57.600
I'm really sorry. I really am.

02:36:57.600 --> 02:36:59.600
It's, it's now

02:36:59.600 --> 02:37:01.600
the stages of

02:37:01.600 --> 02:37:03.600
a Trish freak out and

02:37:07.600 --> 02:37:09.600
like, I feel

02:37:09.600 --> 02:37:11.600
good, I feel strong, I feel like

02:37:11.600 --> 02:37:13.600
loved and cared

02:37:13.600 --> 02:37:15.600
for over here. Even the

02:37:15.600 --> 02:37:17.600
crew and Hila, that

02:37:17.600 --> 02:37:19.600
I'm sorry

02:37:19.600 --> 02:37:21.600
and I hope

02:37:21.600 --> 02:37:23.600
in time that we

02:37:23.600 --> 02:37:25.600
will be able to

02:37:25.600 --> 02:37:27.600
talk again. Like,

02:37:27.600 --> 02:37:29.600
I know once Trish is broken, like,

02:37:29.600 --> 02:37:31.600
it's nearly impossible

02:37:33.600 --> 02:37:35.600
to gain back, but

02:37:35.600 --> 02:37:37.600
I'm willing

02:37:37.600 --> 02:37:39.600
to put an effort.

02:37:39.600 --> 02:37:41.600
I don't think it's necessarily the wrong way to

02:37:41.600 --> 02:37:43.600
go about it. It's important that you make people understand

02:37:43.600 --> 02:37:45.600
where you're coming from, and how a mindset may have

02:37:45.600 --> 02:37:47.600
caused you to act out in a particular way,

02:37:47.600 --> 02:37:49.600
and some appear to praise him for this. However,

02:37:49.600 --> 02:37:51.600
some also question whether this should have been done privately

02:37:51.600 --> 02:37:53.600
first, and not too long after, Ethan

02:37:53.600 --> 02:37:55.600
Klein replied, echoing other people's issues

02:37:55.600 --> 02:37:57.600
and emphasising the damage he believed they had caused

02:37:57.600 --> 02:37:59.600
with their prior content.

02:37:59.600 --> 02:38:01.600
She said in her video,

02:38:01.600 --> 02:38:03.600
I'm gonna make this apology, and

02:38:03.600 --> 02:38:05.600
Ethan doesn't have to accept it.

02:38:05.600 --> 02:38:07.600
It's not

02:38:07.600 --> 02:38:09.600
that I don't accept her apology,

02:38:09.600 --> 02:38:11.600
it's that I just,

02:38:11.600 --> 02:38:13.600
I don't wanna gloss over

02:38:13.600 --> 02:38:15.600
too much what went down.

02:38:15.600 --> 02:38:17.600
I mean,

02:38:17.600 --> 02:38:19.600
it's a lot for me to forgive this

02:38:19.600 --> 02:38:21.600
fast. Now, I think a public apology for a

02:38:21.600 --> 02:38:23.600
public issue is always useful, because viewers

02:38:23.600 --> 02:38:25.600
know where you stand, but Trisha had reached a stage

02:38:25.600 --> 02:38:27.600
where so much of themselves was online that

02:38:27.600 --> 02:38:29.600
each public video felt performative,

02:38:29.600 --> 02:38:31.600
and therefore Ethan was going to be suspicious of

02:38:31.600 --> 02:38:33.600
this sudden about turn, even for Trisha.

02:38:33.600 --> 02:38:35.600
I think the problem, and this

02:38:35.600 --> 02:38:37.600
once again ties back to Dr. Drew, with the previous

02:38:37.600 --> 02:38:39.600
onset of disputes, it became an established

02:38:39.600 --> 02:38:41.600
solution to almost use other things as a

02:38:41.600 --> 02:38:43.600
medium to channel frustrations that they weren't

02:38:43.600 --> 02:38:45.600
prepared to express. Let things escalate, and

02:38:45.600 --> 02:38:47.600
then rely on the other party's recognition of that matter.

02:38:47.600 --> 02:38:49.600
I don't doubt that Trisha likely had qualms with the

02:38:49.600 --> 02:38:51.600
process of the podcast, and didn't know how to express

02:38:51.600 --> 02:38:53.600
them at first, or lashed out unnecessarily.

02:38:53.600 --> 02:38:55.600
However, with the context of the subsequent videos

02:38:55.600 --> 02:38:57.600
and the apology, the initial departure didn't

02:38:57.600 --> 02:38:59.600
actually feel like a genuine expression of intent.

02:38:59.600 --> 02:39:01.600
It felt like a way to once again make a statement

02:39:01.600 --> 02:39:03.600
on a problem that they perceived. In many of

02:39:03.600 --> 02:39:05.600
these videos, Trisha would emphasise how their

02:39:05.600 --> 02:39:07.600
sound of mind now, either due to therapy,

02:39:07.600 --> 02:39:09.600
or changes to their lifestyle, as a way to

02:39:09.600 --> 02:39:11.600
justify how this was them now speaking

02:39:11.600 --> 02:39:13.600
with clarity. It was a way to

02:39:13.600 --> 02:39:15.600
frame their past behaviour as impulsive,

02:39:15.600 --> 02:39:17.600
not the real them, but with this, it was

02:39:17.600 --> 02:39:19.600
difficult to know when we were ever receiving

02:39:19.600 --> 02:39:21.600
the real Trisha. It felt like Trisha was trying

02:39:21.600 --> 02:39:23.600
different techniques for the same result, trying

02:39:23.600 --> 02:39:25.600
to present each one as their real

02:39:25.600 --> 02:39:27.600
findings, and then gauging reaction.

02:39:27.600 --> 02:39:29.600
Despite my criticisms though, I will say

02:39:29.600 --> 02:39:31.600
one thing. It showed that regardless of the defensive

02:39:31.600 --> 02:39:33.600
fronts, that Trisha still clearly

02:39:33.600 --> 02:39:35.600
cared about their friendship with Ethan. Really,

02:39:35.600 --> 02:39:37.600
all these methods screamed to me that this was

02:39:37.600 --> 02:39:39.600
someone who wanted something, but didn't know how

02:39:39.600 --> 02:39:41.600
to get it. Unfortunately, because of previous

02:39:41.600 --> 02:39:43.600
instances, it seemed that the easiest route was

02:39:43.600 --> 02:39:45.600
to be somewhat hostile. This time, however,

02:39:45.600 --> 02:39:47.600
Ethan drew a line, and in spite of what may have

02:39:47.600 --> 02:39:49.600
been an apology, Ethan couldn't accept

02:39:49.600 --> 02:39:51.600
it. He acknowledged, and even

02:39:51.600 --> 02:39:53.600
appreciated it, but he stopped short of accepting

02:39:53.600 --> 02:39:55.600
it. The apology may have

02:39:55.600 --> 02:39:57.600
come from a genuine place, who knows,

02:39:57.600 --> 02:39:59.600
but it couldn't overshadow the fact that it

02:39:59.600 --> 02:40:01.600
followed two weeks of continuous public

02:40:01.600 --> 02:40:03.600
mudsling. It felt like Trisha was looking

02:40:03.600 --> 02:40:05.600
for the ends, but didn't understand

02:40:05.600 --> 02:40:07.600
the means. If this was 20 days earlier,

02:40:07.600 --> 02:40:09.600
then maybe it would have started rebuilding

02:40:09.600 --> 02:40:11.600
that bridge, but at this point, the ravine

02:40:11.600 --> 02:40:13.600
between the two was just far too wide.

02:40:13.600 --> 02:40:15.600
How was Ethan to know that this wasn't just

02:40:15.600 --> 02:40:17.600
another vehicle in an attempt to

02:40:17.600 --> 02:40:19.600
relaunch Frenemies? There were lots of

02:40:19.600 --> 02:40:21.600
points that could have marked the firm end of Frenemies,

02:40:21.600 --> 02:40:23.600
but I think Ethan's tepid response to

02:40:23.600 --> 02:40:25.600
Trisha's apology indicated the return

02:40:25.600 --> 02:40:27.600
of the podcast was beyond hope.

02:40:27.600 --> 02:40:29.600
I think Ethan had come to terms with this end

02:40:29.600 --> 02:40:31.600
not too long after Trisha had announced they were

02:40:31.600 --> 02:40:33.600
stepping down, and this was his ultimatum

02:40:33.600 --> 02:40:35.600
to Trisha to accept it as well.

02:40:35.600 --> 02:40:37.600
How would they move forward from this?

02:40:37.600 --> 02:40:39.600
Well, sometimes Frenemy ships

02:40:39.600 --> 02:40:41.600
aren't built to last.

02:40:49.600 --> 02:40:51.600
Ethan addressed Trisha's apology one more time

02:40:51.600 --> 02:40:53.600
in a segment on Off The Rails. In this, he echoed

02:40:53.600 --> 02:40:55.600
many of the sentiments that he had expressed on Twitter

02:40:55.600 --> 02:40:57.600
in a much more discernible tone of frustrated

02:40:57.600 --> 02:40:59.600
exasperation, asserting that although

02:40:59.600 --> 02:41:01.600
he wasn't opposed to an eventual reconciliation,

02:41:01.600 --> 02:41:03.600
he wasn't prepared to forgive so quickly

02:41:03.600 --> 02:41:05.600
and needed time. He also wasn't prepared

02:41:05.600 --> 02:41:07.600
to let someone like Trisha close again,

02:41:07.600 --> 02:41:09.600
when that in mind was not interested in reviving

02:41:09.600 --> 02:41:11.600
the podcast, yet this was far

02:41:11.600 --> 02:41:13.600
from the end.

02:41:37.600 --> 02:41:39.600
Trisha was saying everything she could

02:41:39.600 --> 02:41:41.600
to attack me personally, to attack

02:41:41.600 --> 02:41:43.600
the business. If this is an apology

02:41:43.600 --> 02:41:45.600
to me, why do I have to watch it on her

02:41:45.600 --> 02:41:47.600
YouTube channel with 10 mid-rolls?

02:41:47.600 --> 02:41:49.600
A phone call would have been nice. She has my

02:41:49.600 --> 02:41:51.600
number, she knows that I'm open to talk

02:41:51.600 --> 02:41:53.600
anytime, she missed, you know what I mean?

02:41:53.600 --> 02:41:55.600
And she apologized to the crew, she said

02:41:55.600 --> 02:41:57.600
previously she doesn't have any of the crew's contact

02:41:57.600 --> 02:41:59.600
information, I'm sorry, but that's not true.

02:41:59.600 --> 02:42:01.600
We're all in a group chat on WhatsApp,

02:42:01.600 --> 02:42:03.600
she has everybody's phone number.

02:42:03.600 --> 02:42:05.600
Around a week and a half after, Trisha uploaded a video

02:42:05.600 --> 02:42:07.600
claiming there was an unaired episode of

02:42:07.600 --> 02:42:09.600
Friendemies which featured a greater reconciliation

02:42:09.600 --> 02:42:11.600
between the two parties, including an

02:42:11.600 --> 02:42:13.600
apology from Ethan. You may seem to believe

02:42:13.600 --> 02:42:15.600
this was filmed to promote their post-breakup merchandise

02:42:15.600 --> 02:42:17.600
release that was being dropped around the same time.

02:42:17.600 --> 02:42:19.600
However, after the merch sold out nearly

02:42:19.600 --> 02:42:21.600
instantaneously, the motive to upload the

02:42:21.600 --> 02:42:23.600
video was assumedly diminished.

02:42:23.600 --> 02:42:25.600
After Trisha's video covering this, many podcast

02:42:25.600 --> 02:42:27.600
fans requested that Ethan not upload

02:42:27.600 --> 02:42:29.600
the video as they didn't want the drama prolonged,

02:42:29.600 --> 02:42:31.600
and the episode, whatever its contents,

02:42:31.600 --> 02:42:33.600
was never released. Following this,

02:42:33.600 --> 02:42:35.600
there was a moment of respite, as it seemed

02:42:35.600 --> 02:42:37.600
that both had just grown apart, and even

02:42:37.600 --> 02:42:39.600
if reconciliation wasn't possible, the

02:42:39.600 --> 02:42:41.600
absence of conflict was a welcome break for most

02:42:41.600 --> 02:42:43.600
viewers. However, it always felt like a ceasefire

02:42:43.600 --> 02:42:45.600
as opposed to a peace treaty, mainly

02:42:45.600 --> 02:42:47.600
due to this suggested rapprochement on

02:42:47.600 --> 02:42:49.600
Trisha's video. It's very hard for me to speculate

02:42:49.600 --> 02:42:51.600
on what may or may not have been said,

02:42:51.600 --> 02:42:53.600
because the only source is Trisha, and they do

02:42:53.600 --> 02:42:55.600
have their biases, but if this video

02:42:55.600 --> 02:42:57.600
marked some sort of understanding between the

02:42:57.600 --> 02:42:59.600
two, then it wasn't to be recognized by

02:42:59.600 --> 02:43:01.600
anyone outside, and in future videos

02:43:01.600 --> 02:43:03.600
the underlying message was that there was still

02:43:03.600 --> 02:43:05.600
unresolved tension.

02:43:25.600 --> 02:43:27.600
For a while this seemed like Trisha's angle,

02:43:27.600 --> 02:43:29.600
and maybe if this philosophy had sustained itself,

02:43:29.600 --> 02:43:31.600
an eventual modification would have been

02:43:31.600 --> 02:43:33.600
reached, but unfortunately this was not

02:43:33.600 --> 02:43:35.600
the case. As I noted earlier, regardless

02:43:35.600 --> 02:43:37.600
of what you think of the apology, it felt more

02:43:37.600 --> 02:43:39.600
like another momentary decision rather than

02:43:39.600 --> 02:43:41.600
a concrete resolution. For many people,

02:43:41.600 --> 02:43:43.600
an apology normally marks the end of something,

02:43:43.600 --> 02:43:45.600
a concession that you'd be foolish

02:43:45.600 --> 02:43:47.600
to walk back on. At the same time,

02:43:47.600 --> 02:43:49.600
sometimes as people feel they've been manipulated into

02:43:49.600 --> 02:43:51.600
making a confession, they may retract it,

02:43:51.600 --> 02:43:53.600
and as time transpired, Trisha seemed

02:43:53.600 --> 02:43:55.600
to walk back their narrative once more,

02:43:55.600 --> 02:43:57.600
slowly returning to their former position,

02:43:57.600 --> 02:43:59.600
that they really had done nothing wrong, and

02:43:59.600 --> 02:44:01.600
that responsibility primarily lay with Ethan.

02:44:19.600 --> 02:44:21.600
It felt like the situation ultimately wasn't resolved,

02:44:21.600 --> 02:44:23.600
Trisha felt inclined to continuously make these

02:44:23.600 --> 02:44:25.600
statements to try and keep it alive, while making

02:44:25.600 --> 02:44:27.600
it look like they weren't necessarily going

02:44:27.600 --> 02:44:29.600
out of their way to talk about it, coincidentally

02:44:29.600 --> 02:44:31.600
appearing on these podcasts who just seem

02:44:31.600 --> 02:44:33.600
to be interested in discussing the latest

02:44:33.600 --> 02:44:35.600
tea. Throughout all this, Ethan really

02:44:35.600 --> 02:44:37.600
didn't say much, and whether that influenced

02:44:37.600 --> 02:44:39.600
Trisha's next move is your judgement to make.

02:44:39.600 --> 02:44:41.600
What move was that, I hear you ask?

02:44:41.600 --> 02:44:43.600
Well, as I mentioned

02:44:43.600 --> 02:44:45.600
a while back, Ethan's often quite

02:44:45.600 --> 02:44:47.600
vocal with who he despises,

02:44:47.600 --> 02:44:49.600
and one person who definitely fits that bill is

02:44:49.600 --> 02:44:51.600
Keemstar, who Ethan has waged war against for

02:44:51.600 --> 02:44:53.600
a good few years. Trisha in many ways

02:44:53.600 --> 02:44:55.600
also seemed to be vocally critical

02:44:55.600 --> 02:44:57.600
of Keemstar, attacking him for a variety

02:44:57.600 --> 02:44:59.600
of reasons over the years, but if Trisha's

02:44:59.600 --> 02:45:01.600
relationship with Ethan taught us anything

02:45:01.600 --> 02:45:03.600
is that Trisha's sentiments can be known to

02:45:03.600 --> 02:45:05.600
fluctuate a little. At that time, Keemstar

02:45:05.600 --> 02:45:07.600
had found himself in some controversy due to

02:45:07.600 --> 02:45:09.600
the age gap in his relationship with a

02:45:09.600 --> 02:45:11.600
20-year-old female. At the same time, both

02:45:11.600 --> 02:45:13.600
Ethan and Trisha had separately taken to YouTube

02:45:13.600 --> 02:45:15.600
to criticise him, Ethan on his After

02:45:15.600 --> 02:45:17.600
Dark podcast, and Trisha on their third

02:45:17.600 --> 02:45:18.600
episode of Enemies.

02:45:18.600 --> 02:45:20.600
And she doesn't know that I played

02:45:20.600 --> 02:45:22.600
bad guy Keem online. Okay, if you're

02:45:22.600 --> 02:45:24.600
bad guy Keem online and that's a character you're

02:45:24.600 --> 02:45:26.600
playing, Daniel Keem, then you're an actual

02:45:26.600 --> 02:45:28.600
creep in real life, like you are actually

02:45:28.600 --> 02:45:30.600
a real-life perv, a real-life

02:45:30.600 --> 02:45:32.600
just creep, just evil, just nasty,

02:45:32.600 --> 02:45:34.600
just a nasty old man that's like

02:45:34.600 --> 02:45:36.600
hurting this girl in ways that she may

02:45:36.600 --> 02:45:38.600
not know, but you know,

02:45:38.600 --> 02:45:40.600
you know, because I know he knows because

02:45:40.600 --> 02:45:42.600
he's constantly bringing up things people are gonna

02:45:42.600 --> 02:45:44.600
say, the power play, the this, but she's not

02:45:44.600 --> 02:45:46.600
a fan. Trying to rationalise it on

02:45:46.600 --> 02:45:48.600
this show, on Spotify, on his podcast

02:45:48.600 --> 02:45:50.600
is like mind-blowing

02:45:51.600 --> 02:45:53.600
Keemstar played this off with the usual

02:45:53.600 --> 02:45:55.600
bombast that many expected from him, leaning

02:45:55.600 --> 02:45:57.600
into the stereotype rather than running away

02:45:57.600 --> 02:45:59.600
from it, if anything it showed that neither side

02:45:59.600 --> 02:46:01.600
was willing to yield, yet for some fans it may have

02:46:01.600 --> 02:46:03.600
been refreshing that Ethan and Trisha finally agreed

02:46:03.600 --> 02:46:05.600
on something once more, but this moment of blissful

02:46:05.600 --> 02:46:07.600
harmony was short-lived, as less than a week

02:46:07.600 --> 02:46:09.600
after this Keemstar tweeted a picture of him

02:46:09.600 --> 02:46:11.600
with FaZe Banks alongside, lo and behold,

02:46:11.600 --> 02:46:13.600
Trisha Paytas, all looking

02:46:13.600 --> 02:46:15.600
rather pleased with themselves, I wonder

02:46:15.600 --> 02:46:17.600
why. This of course provoked a response

02:46:17.600 --> 02:46:19.600
from Ethan who expressed disappointment of Trisha's

02:46:19.600 --> 02:46:21.600
newfound allegiance, Trisha responded

02:46:21.600 --> 02:46:23.600
over a variety of mediums, but we're gonna skip

02:46:23.600 --> 02:46:25.600
over those for now. However, what would

02:46:25.600 --> 02:46:27.600
the podcast actually be about?

02:46:27.600 --> 02:46:29.600
After all, you can't just judge a book by

02:46:29.600 --> 02:46:31.600
its cover, and Trish requested that everyone

02:46:31.600 --> 02:46:33.600
give the episode a chance.

02:46:49.600 --> 02:46:55.600
In the podcast,

02:46:55.600 --> 02:46:57.600
Keemstar explains how it reached out to Trisha

02:46:57.600 --> 02:46:59.600
offering a truce, and Trisha had agreed.

02:46:59.600 --> 02:47:01.600
Trisha is fast to clarify that they're not

02:47:01.600 --> 02:47:03.600
necessarily befriending Keemstar, and they're

02:47:03.600 --> 02:47:05.600
actually still more pro-Ethan than pro-Keem,

02:47:05.600 --> 02:47:07.600
though they definitely don't hold back in

02:47:07.600 --> 02:47:09.600
analysing Ethan's behaviour over the previous

02:47:09.600 --> 02:47:11.600
months.

02:47:19.600 --> 02:47:21.600
Like, never aired, right?

02:47:21.600 --> 02:47:23.600
Can I say that publicly?

02:47:23.600 --> 02:47:25.600
There's an unaired last episode?

02:47:25.600 --> 02:47:27.600
Yeah, we shot

02:47:27.600 --> 02:47:29.600
one more for closure, and it was really

02:47:29.600 --> 02:47:31.600
good, because I do feel

02:47:31.600 --> 02:47:33.600
like I'd fucked up a lot, but it was the first

02:47:33.600 --> 02:47:35.600
time Ethan admitted to screenshotting

02:47:35.600 --> 02:47:37.600
my text, and I was like, oh perfect, this

02:47:37.600 --> 02:47:39.600
will give me some redeeming qualities, because

02:47:39.600 --> 02:47:41.600
he admitted in that that I never said fire to the crew, and I was like, perfect,

02:47:41.600 --> 02:47:43.600
people are gonna know, they're gonna stop hating on me.

02:47:43.600 --> 02:47:45.600
But then, yeah, he didn't post it, because he's like,

02:47:45.600 --> 02:47:47.600
well, I don't want more hate to the crew, and it's gonna

02:47:47.600 --> 02:47:49.600
pass out this person, and I was just like,

02:47:49.600 --> 02:47:51.600
you posted all my breakdowns, but you're not gonna post this one

02:47:51.600 --> 02:47:53.600
where I kinda look like, at least we're

02:47:53.600 --> 02:47:55.600
balanced in being in the wrong, yeah.

02:47:55.600 --> 02:47:57.600
So I have a little animosity towards him, like, I still

02:47:57.600 --> 02:47:59.600
obviously love Ethan, but I do

02:47:59.600 --> 02:48:01.600
have a little bit of that, I get what you're saying.

02:48:01.600 --> 02:48:03.600
I think being sat down with two people who have a history

02:48:03.600 --> 02:48:05.600
of conflict with Ethan kind of draws Trisha into this

02:48:05.600 --> 02:48:07.600
discussion about him more than they probably

02:48:07.600 --> 02:48:09.600
plan to be. The conversation isn't just about

02:48:09.600 --> 02:48:11.600
Ethan, but it regularly returns to him.

02:48:11.600 --> 02:48:13.600
Keemstar driving home the point that in his opinion,

02:48:13.600 --> 02:48:15.600
Ethan is a moral weatherbane, and

02:48:15.600 --> 02:48:17.600
sends the popular opinions to garner a social

02:48:17.600 --> 02:48:19.600
advantage, while receiving special treatment

02:48:19.600 --> 02:48:21.600
from YouTube. Trisha often plays off this

02:48:21.600 --> 02:48:23.600
narrative with their own personal experiences,

02:48:23.600 --> 02:48:25.600
talking about many of the previous incidents that still

02:48:25.600 --> 02:48:27.600
seem unresolved to them.

02:48:27.600 --> 02:48:29.600
He's a walking, talking hypocrite.

02:48:29.600 --> 02:48:31.600
Oh, for sure, I don't think there's anything wrong with that,

02:48:31.600 --> 02:48:33.600
because I'm also a walking, talking hypocrite.

02:48:33.600 --> 02:48:35.600
I think, again, it's just the lack of, like, admitting

02:48:35.600 --> 02:48:37.600
that, like, I feel like if you could admit it,

02:48:37.600 --> 02:48:39.600
because I, 100%, like, even me sitting here,

02:48:39.600 --> 02:48:41.600
people are like, she's so hypocritical, whatever, you know what I mean?

02:48:41.600 --> 02:48:43.600
But I don't think it is that either, I honestly think

02:48:43.600 --> 02:48:45.600
it's just, like, having a discussion, but...

02:49:13.600 --> 02:49:15.600
I mean, I think it's, like, gross when people do make fun

02:49:15.600 --> 02:49:17.600
of people's, like, looks, or small penises, or whatever.

02:49:17.600 --> 02:49:19.600
I don't like when people make fun

02:49:19.600 --> 02:49:21.600
of people's, like, aesthetic, but I'm telling you

02:49:21.600 --> 02:49:23.600
that's how me and Ethan first met, he made a whole video

02:49:23.600 --> 02:49:25.600
calling me, like, a whale, like, a corpse,

02:49:25.600 --> 02:49:27.600
like, all this stuff, saying how, like, I photoshopped my pictures,

02:49:27.600 --> 02:49:29.600
so, like, he did the same thing to me, so it is

02:49:29.600 --> 02:49:31.600
a little hypocritical, but I do think it, I mean,

02:49:31.600 --> 02:49:33.600
that was... It was ironic that this was

02:49:33.600 --> 02:49:35.600
approximately a year after Keem had offered a truce

02:49:35.600 --> 02:49:37.600
to Ethan, who started framing me shortly after.

02:49:37.600 --> 02:49:39.600
This time, it was Keem's turn to platform

02:49:39.600 --> 02:49:41.600
Trisha, though. It seems that Keem had worked

02:49:41.600 --> 02:49:43.600
out that although Trisha talked to Big Game,

02:49:43.600 --> 02:49:45.600
they were regularly swayed, and in this case

02:49:45.600 --> 02:49:47.600
it worked out almost exactly as

02:49:47.600 --> 02:49:49.600
envisioned, well, for Keem at least.

02:49:49.600 --> 02:49:51.600
This wasn't out of the ordinary for Trisha,

02:49:51.600 --> 02:49:53.600
they're known to go on podcasts for people they have

02:49:53.600 --> 02:49:55.600
grievances with, that's why they appeared on the H3 podcast

02:49:55.600 --> 02:49:57.600
in the first place. However, given how the

02:49:57.600 --> 02:49:59.600
discussion does tend to pivot towards

02:49:59.600 --> 02:50:01.600
Ethan, and given how Ethan doesn't quite

02:50:01.600 --> 02:50:03.600
share the same philosophy, people weren't

02:50:03.600 --> 02:50:05.600
entirely happy, and neither

02:50:05.600 --> 02:50:07.600
was Ethan.

02:50:11.600 --> 02:50:13.600
In

02:50:13.600 --> 02:50:15.600
this situation, even the

02:50:15.600 --> 02:50:17.600
photo of Trisha with Keemstar had provoked

02:50:17.600 --> 02:50:19.600
a bit of uproar from the Clines, however, there was

02:50:19.600 --> 02:50:21.600
also a bit more context that makes the

02:50:21.600 --> 02:50:23.600
circumstances more primed for hostility.

02:50:23.600 --> 02:50:25.600
The girl is not to blame for

02:50:25.600 --> 02:50:27.600
anything. The girl is

02:50:27.600 --> 02:50:29.600
only 20 years old, she's a child,

02:50:29.600 --> 02:50:31.600
we love, I mean, well, I don't know anything about

02:50:31.600 --> 02:50:33.600
her, but I'm not going after her at all, I was never gonna

02:50:33.600 --> 02:50:35.600
criticise her or say anything bad about her,

02:50:35.600 --> 02:50:37.600
this is just about a 39 year old creep

02:50:37.600 --> 02:50:39.600
preying on a young girl.

02:50:39.600 --> 02:50:41.600
In the video covering Keemstar's new girlfriend,

02:50:41.600 --> 02:50:43.600
Ethan included a segment which

02:50:43.600 --> 02:50:45.600
entailed an individual calling in and claiming

02:50:45.600 --> 02:50:47.600
to be this lady, and going into rather explicit

02:50:47.600 --> 02:50:49.600
detail about the relationship.

02:50:49.600 --> 02:50:51.600
Keemstar felt that there was a double standard being

02:50:51.600 --> 02:50:53.600
operated here, and tweeted a video tagging

02:50:53.600 --> 02:50:55.600
Team YouTube and talking about the situation

02:50:55.600 --> 02:50:57.600
at hand.

02:51:09.600 --> 02:51:11.600
The emails here threatening me that that's

02:51:11.600 --> 02:51:13.600
gonna happen, can't do creator on creator

02:51:13.600 --> 02:51:15.600
harassment, but Ethan Cline

02:51:15.600 --> 02:51:17.600
has made about 50 fucking

02:51:17.600 --> 02:51:19.600
videos breaking

02:51:19.600 --> 02:51:21.600
TOS, breaking the bullying and harassment

02:51:21.600 --> 02:51:23.600
thing, he uploaded a fucking

02:51:23.600 --> 02:51:25.600
video of a Keemstar puppet and he's like

02:51:25.600 --> 02:51:27.600
fucking it, how is that not

02:51:27.600 --> 02:51:29.600
breaking YouTube TOS,

02:51:29.600 --> 02:51:31.600
how is that not breaking the bullying and

02:51:31.600 --> 02:51:33.600
harassment thing, now he uploads this video

02:51:33.600 --> 02:51:35.600
with someone that's supposed to be my new girlfriend,

02:51:35.600 --> 02:51:37.600
it's like a fake person calling

02:51:37.600 --> 02:51:39.600
in, and they're like, yeah Keem's got a

02:51:39.600 --> 02:51:41.600
little dick, Keem's dick doesn't

02:51:41.600 --> 02:51:43.600
work, and am I over here crying

02:51:43.600 --> 02:51:45.600
about it? Absolutely not.

02:51:45.600 --> 02:51:47.600
But let me talk shit back.

02:51:47.600 --> 02:51:49.600
I really wanna fucking know

02:51:49.600 --> 02:51:51.600
Susan, Team YouTube,

02:51:51.600 --> 02:51:53.600
everybody at YouTube, why is it

02:51:53.600 --> 02:51:55.600
Keemstar versus H3H3,

02:51:55.600 --> 02:51:57.600
I have sent emails

02:51:57.600 --> 02:51:59.600
when he broke TOS saying, hey look

02:51:59.600 --> 02:52:01.600
he's doing the same thing that you threatened to kick me

02:52:01.600 --> 02:52:03.600
out of the partnership program, and it gets

02:52:03.600 --> 02:52:05.600
ignored. Explain the blatant

02:52:05.600 --> 02:52:07.600
fucking bias, because all

02:52:07.600 --> 02:52:09.600
these fucking YouTubers, David Dobrik,

02:52:09.600 --> 02:52:11.600
everyone else has dealt with this bullshit

02:52:11.600 --> 02:52:13.600
with Ethan Klein, why is it other

02:52:13.600 --> 02:52:15.600
YouTubers versus Ethan Klein

02:52:15.600 --> 02:52:17.600
and YouTube staff, please explain

02:52:17.600 --> 02:52:19.600
it to all of us right now,

02:52:19.600 --> 02:52:21.600
why he's getting special privileges.

02:52:21.600 --> 02:52:23.600
Not too long after this, the H3 After

02:52:23.600 --> 02:52:25.600
Dark video on the matter was removed for violating

02:52:25.600 --> 02:52:27.600
YouTube's TOS, with many assuming

02:52:27.600 --> 02:52:29.600
that Keemstar played a hand in this.

02:52:29.600 --> 02:52:31.600
Though he denied direct involvement in the removal

02:52:31.600 --> 02:52:33.600
of the video, it was hard to completely buy

02:52:33.600 --> 02:52:35.600
this idea that his vocal outcries hadn't

02:52:35.600 --> 02:52:37.600
influenced YouTube in some sort of way,

02:52:37.600 --> 02:52:39.600
with many requesting to see his flag history.

02:52:39.600 --> 02:52:41.600
For someone like Ethan, who already vehemently loathes

02:52:41.600 --> 02:52:43.600
Keemstar, there was no two ways about

02:52:43.600 --> 02:52:45.600
it. Keemstar had committed an attack on the podcast,

02:52:45.600 --> 02:52:47.600
and a form of friends alliance at a time

02:52:47.600 --> 02:52:49.600
of heightened conflict was a stonewall

02:52:49.600 --> 02:52:51.600
betrayal. With this in mind, in his first

02:52:51.600 --> 02:52:53.600
H3 Off the Rails back, Ethan decides

02:52:53.600 --> 02:52:55.600
to address Trisha Paytas one last

02:52:55.600 --> 02:52:56.600
time.

02:52:56.600 --> 02:52:58.600
So basically what this is to me,

02:52:58.600 --> 02:53:00.600
she is uh,

02:53:00.600 --> 02:53:02.600
what's the name of that famous turncoat

02:53:02.600 --> 02:53:04.600
during the revolutionary Benedict

02:53:04.600 --> 02:53:06.600
Benedict Arnold? Yeah, she Benedict

02:53:06.600 --> 02:53:08.600
Arnold'd me big time.

02:53:08.600 --> 02:53:10.600
This is an unforgivable

02:53:10.600 --> 02:53:12.600
traitorous act. And I'm going to explain

02:53:12.600 --> 02:53:14.600
in great detail why.

02:53:14.600 --> 02:53:16.600
And I'm going to be totally honest with you guys,

02:53:16.600 --> 02:53:18.600
a part of me wanted to take the high road

02:53:18.600 --> 02:53:20.600
on this and just ignore it.

02:53:20.600 --> 02:53:22.600
Uh, but at the same time, I'm

02:53:22.600 --> 02:53:24.600
so sick of her disrespecting

02:53:24.600 --> 02:53:26.600
me, and my family,

02:53:26.600 --> 02:53:28.600
and causing shit,

02:53:28.600 --> 02:53:30.600
and just being so toxic, lying,

02:53:30.600 --> 02:53:32.600
and I'm just so

02:53:32.600 --> 02:53:34.600
freaking over her.

02:53:34.600 --> 02:53:36.600
Now as I've noted, it's not exactly

02:53:36.600 --> 02:53:38.600
surprising taking a perfunctory look

02:53:38.600 --> 02:53:40.600
at Trisha's history. They wanted to go on

02:53:40.600 --> 02:53:42.600
Keem's podcast, though Ethan certainly compiles

02:53:42.600 --> 02:53:44.600
a fair assembly of clips that make even

02:53:44.600 --> 02:53:46.600
this decision look a bit inconsistent

02:53:46.600 --> 02:53:48.600
on Trisha's part, especially given

02:53:48.600 --> 02:53:50.600
their familial relation, throwing some shade

02:53:50.600 --> 02:53:52.600
towards Moses as well. Trisha's even

02:53:52.600 --> 02:53:54.600
gone on podcast with Gabbie Hanna previously,

02:53:54.600 --> 02:53:56.600
so it's clear that they're not entirely hostile

02:53:56.600 --> 02:53:58.600
to anyone. But in a way, although it makes

02:53:58.600 --> 02:54:00.600
sense that Trisha would do this, the question

02:54:00.600 --> 02:54:02.600
Ethan wants to ask is, should she?

02:54:28.600 --> 02:54:30.600
Can this story get blown out of proportion?

02:54:30.600 --> 02:54:32.600
Girl, what?

02:54:58.600 --> 02:55:00.600
serious, serious help. So don't even think

02:55:00.600 --> 02:55:02.600
for a second that you're trolling, or ruining, or

02:55:02.600 --> 02:55:04.600
anyone thinks around it.

02:55:04.600 --> 02:55:06.600
So she has that much energy

02:55:06.600 --> 02:55:08.600
for our word apologist,

02:55:08.600 --> 02:55:10.600
but keep the same energy

02:55:10.600 --> 02:55:12.600
because, um,

02:55:12.600 --> 02:55:14.600
Keemstar,

02:55:14.600 --> 02:55:16.600
on the same exact situation,

02:55:16.600 --> 02:55:18.600
said way worse things, and if you care

02:55:18.600 --> 02:55:20.600
about Jessie Smiles, she

02:55:20.600 --> 02:55:22.600
seemed to have been way more

02:55:22.600 --> 02:55:24.600
offended by what Keemstar said than

02:55:24.600 --> 02:55:26.600
Gabbie, of the

02:55:26.600 --> 02:55:28.600
protecting.

02:55:28.600 --> 02:55:30.600
You have handled this situation with such poor taste.

02:55:30.600 --> 02:55:32.600
You're right, you don't know what happened.

02:55:32.600 --> 02:55:34.600
But you sure felt like you did all these years

02:55:34.600 --> 02:55:36.600
when you consistently called me a liar,

02:55:36.600 --> 02:55:38.600
mocked my accusations. Sorry

02:55:38.600 --> 02:55:40.600
you hate all these r-word cases. By the way,

02:55:40.600 --> 02:55:42.600
must be hard on you. And she included

02:55:42.600 --> 02:55:44.600
a screenshot of Keemstar saying, sorry,

02:55:44.600 --> 02:55:46.600
Jessie Smiles tagged her on

02:55:46.600 --> 02:55:48.600
Twitter, only has 140

02:55:48.600 --> 02:55:50.600
characters. Please don't accuse me

02:55:50.600 --> 02:55:52.600
of r-word. He's making a joke out of it.

02:55:52.600 --> 02:55:54.600
Basically accusing her of making

02:55:54.600 --> 02:55:56.600
false allegations.

02:55:56.600 --> 02:55:58.600
This is just one specific

02:55:58.600 --> 02:56:00.600
example of Keemstar's

02:56:00.600 --> 02:56:02.600
continued

02:56:04.600 --> 02:56:06.600
history of

02:56:06.600 --> 02:56:08.600
not believing victims.

02:56:08.600 --> 02:56:10.600
In part, he does respond to the

02:56:10.600 --> 02:56:12.600
narratives espoused throughout the podcast,

02:56:12.600 --> 02:56:14.600
but more tries take a holistic standpoint that this

02:56:14.600 --> 02:56:16.600
is Keemstar taking advantage of Trisha

02:56:16.600 --> 02:56:18.600
for his own gain, showing a variety of tweets

02:56:18.600 --> 02:56:20.600
and clips that seem to imply that Keemstar is

02:56:20.600 --> 02:56:22.600
enjoying the situation much more than anyone

02:56:22.600 --> 02:56:24.600
else's. Even supposedly inviting

02:56:24.600 --> 02:56:26.600
Gabbie Hanna on the same day they were hosting

02:56:26.600 --> 02:56:28.600
Trisha and joking about it with FaZe Banks

02:56:28.600 --> 02:56:30.600
on the podcast.

02:56:52.600 --> 02:56:54.600
Jorts on.

02:56:54.600 --> 02:56:56.600
Legends. Legend.

02:56:56.600 --> 02:56:58.600
Here, now, again, she's

02:56:58.600 --> 02:57:00.600
a free speech advocate all the sudden

02:57:00.600 --> 02:57:02.600
and she believes in

02:57:02.600 --> 02:57:04.600
talking to anyone about anything, right?

02:57:04.600 --> 02:57:06.600
So here is, here they, they're kind

02:57:06.600 --> 02:57:08.600
of teasing her a little bit. They're kind of making a fool

02:57:08.600 --> 02:57:10.600
out of her. Listen to this.

02:57:10.600 --> 02:57:12.600
He was here. Imagine- I swear I thought you were gonna do that.

02:57:12.600 --> 02:57:14.600
No, but listen, listen. Imagine if Gabbie was here

02:57:14.600 --> 02:57:16.600
and we posted a picture, FaZe Banks

02:57:16.600 --> 02:57:18.600
Keemstar, Trisha, Gabbie.

02:57:18.600 --> 02:57:20.600
I'd bolt.

02:57:20.600 --> 02:57:22.600
She'd bolt.

02:57:22.600 --> 02:57:24.600
She's there. Gabbie's there.

02:57:24.600 --> 02:57:26.600
Or at least she's on her way there.

02:57:26.600 --> 02:57:28.600
So Keemstar starts being like, can you imagine

02:57:28.600 --> 02:57:30.600
if Gabbie was here?

02:57:30.600 --> 02:57:32.600
She's testing the water a little bit.

02:57:32.600 --> 02:57:34.600
I'd bolt.

02:57:34.600 --> 02:57:36.600
Interesting.

02:57:36.600 --> 02:57:38.600
I wouldn't do that to you.

02:57:38.600 --> 02:57:40.600
I wouldn't do that to you.

02:57:40.600 --> 02:57:42.600
On the whole though, this video is designed to be the final nail

02:57:42.600 --> 02:57:44.600
in the coffin for Ethan and Trisha's working

02:57:44.600 --> 02:57:46.600
relationship, and dare I say it, friendship.

02:57:46.600 --> 02:57:48.600
Even goes on to discuss the unaired

02:57:48.600 --> 02:57:50.600
episode which Trisha had been bringing up over the last

02:57:50.600 --> 02:57:52.600
month, and explains that the reason it wasn't released

02:57:52.600 --> 02:57:54.600
was because he didn't feel like it gave anyone

02:57:54.600 --> 02:57:56.600
the closure Trisha claims it did, and it was actually

02:57:56.600 --> 02:57:58.600
quite an uncomfortable recording which he rather

02:57:58.600 --> 02:58:00.600
regrets. He also notes that Trisha

02:58:00.600 --> 02:58:02.600
claims to have recorded the episode, and has been

02:58:02.600 --> 02:58:04.600
alluding to it in the DMs, stating that he is

02:58:04.600 --> 02:58:06.600
not fazed by the implication that they may release it.

02:58:06.600 --> 02:58:08.600
How everything had gone

02:58:08.600 --> 02:58:10.600
down, I was feeling bad about

02:58:10.600 --> 02:58:12.600
the rift that it had caused

02:58:12.600 --> 02:58:14.600
in the family and everything, and

02:58:14.600 --> 02:58:16.600
I wanted to make amends,

02:58:16.600 --> 02:58:18.600
and in my heart, I thought

02:58:18.600 --> 02:58:20.600
what would be great is if we could just

02:58:20.600 --> 02:58:22.600
come together for one final episode

02:58:22.600 --> 02:58:24.600
for it to be wholesome,

02:58:24.600 --> 02:58:26.600
for it to be just a beautiful experience

02:58:26.600 --> 02:58:28.600
where we just reflect on the nice

02:58:28.600 --> 02:58:30.600
experience we have and part ways

02:58:30.600 --> 02:58:32.600
amicably. As soon as we sat

02:58:32.600 --> 02:58:34.600
down, basically almost immediately

02:58:34.600 --> 02:58:36.600
it just went sideways. It just went

02:58:36.600 --> 02:58:38.600
off the rails,

02:58:38.600 --> 02:58:40.600
it just turned into more accusations

02:58:40.600 --> 02:58:42.600
and it just got really icky.

02:58:42.600 --> 02:58:44.600
And I was like immediately

02:58:44.600 --> 02:58:46.600
regretting it, because it was just

02:58:46.600 --> 02:58:48.600
it was just

02:58:48.600 --> 02:58:50.600
not at all what I wanted or expected.

02:58:50.600 --> 02:58:52.600
This whole claim that like

02:58:52.600 --> 02:58:54.600
I had never apologized to her, she keeps saying like

02:58:54.600 --> 02:58:56.600
he apologized, I proved

02:58:56.600 --> 02:58:58.600
that he, that the, that

02:58:58.600 --> 02:59:00.600
I never said I wanted to fire the crew.

02:59:00.600 --> 02:59:02.600
Um, you know, I admitted

02:59:02.600 --> 02:59:04.600
in my first video, about

02:59:04.600 --> 02:59:06.600
Trisha leaving for enemies, that I

02:59:06.600 --> 02:59:08.600
messed up in showing the crew the text.

02:59:08.600 --> 02:59:10.600
They secretly recorded us,

02:59:10.600 --> 02:59:12.600
which was like

02:59:12.600 --> 02:59:14.600
kind of devastating to me.

02:59:14.600 --> 02:59:16.600
That they came into the house,

02:59:16.600 --> 02:59:18.600
secretly

02:59:18.600 --> 02:59:20.600
recorded our conversations

02:59:20.600 --> 02:59:22.600
before and after the podcast

02:59:22.600 --> 02:59:24.600
and during. The thing is I'm not

02:59:24.600 --> 02:59:26.600
I don't care if they release it, so it's not like a

02:59:26.600 --> 02:59:28.600
I think they think, I don't know why they

02:59:28.600 --> 02:59:30.600
think it's such a big deal, it's just a messy

02:59:30.600 --> 02:59:32.600
episode. But I

02:59:32.600 --> 02:59:34.600
guess in their mind they think they've been

02:59:34.600 --> 02:59:36.600
threatening us with like, well we recorded

02:59:36.600 --> 02:59:38.600
it, here it is,

02:59:38.600 --> 02:59:40.600
we're going to release it,

02:59:40.600 --> 02:59:42.600
you know, I'm listening to it back, it's like

02:59:42.600 --> 02:59:44.600
I just found that like

02:59:44.600 --> 02:59:46.600
such a violation

02:59:46.600 --> 02:59:48.600
to come into our house and secretly

02:59:48.600 --> 02:59:50.600
record us. I was like, wow.

02:59:50.600 --> 02:59:52.600
This may not be closure

02:59:52.600 --> 02:59:54.600
per se, but it is the closest that people

02:59:54.600 --> 02:59:56.600
were going to have. Two contrasting yet

02:59:56.600 --> 02:59:58.600
affirmative perspectives. From this, people

02:59:58.600 --> 03:00:00.600
could draw their own conclusions. However, beyond

03:00:00.600 --> 03:00:02.600
the basic allegations of hypocrisy, there

03:00:02.600 --> 03:00:04.600
was a more troubling allegation. Hypocrisy

03:00:04.600 --> 03:00:06.600
is when you say something in the moment

03:00:06.600 --> 03:00:08.600
and contradict that at a later time, and

03:00:08.600 --> 03:00:10.600
although it can be problematic, it's not particularly

03:00:10.600 --> 03:00:12.600
exceptional, especially in this industry,

03:00:12.600 --> 03:00:14.600
particularly as you often can't decipher

03:00:14.600 --> 03:00:16.600
intent. However, Ethan once more chose to

03:00:16.600 --> 03:00:18.600
go in on Trisha, accusing them of lying over

03:00:18.600 --> 03:00:20.600
a variety of issues relating to the podcast,

03:00:20.600 --> 03:00:22.600
including statements they had made since.

03:00:38.600 --> 03:00:40.600
Uh,

03:00:40.600 --> 03:00:42.600
yeah.

03:01:02.600 --> 03:01:04.600
Wait, how many followers

03:01:04.600 --> 03:01:06.600
does this account have? Oh my god!

03:01:08.600 --> 03:01:10.600
He also gave some attention to

03:01:10.600 --> 03:01:12.600
accounts that seem dedicated to showing these rather

03:01:12.600 --> 03:01:14.600
conscious contradictions, particularly

03:01:14.600 --> 03:01:16.600
those on TikTok. He seems quite amused by

03:01:16.600 --> 03:01:18.600
most of these clips, and although you can understand

03:01:18.600 --> 03:01:20.600
why they would have irked him, often after the collapse

03:01:20.600 --> 03:01:22.600
of a working relationship, you are prone

03:01:22.600 --> 03:01:24.600
to trash talk your former colleague a little,

03:01:24.600 --> 03:01:26.600
so these aren't exactly surprising.

03:01:26.600 --> 03:01:28.600
However, there is one clip that he seems to take slightly

03:01:28.600 --> 03:01:30.600
more seriously, relating to an anecdote

03:01:30.600 --> 03:01:32.600
that Trisha shared while the podcast was still operating

03:01:32.600 --> 03:01:34.600
fairly smoothly.

03:01:38.600 --> 03:01:40.600
That actually

03:01:40.600 --> 03:01:42.600
really disturbed me.

03:02:08.600 --> 03:02:10.600
I wanted a Pomeranian for a long time.

03:02:10.600 --> 03:02:12.600
Both me and my mom have wanted a puppy

03:02:12.600 --> 03:02:14.600
for so long. I live alone.

03:02:14.600 --> 03:02:16.600
My mom is alone.

03:02:16.600 --> 03:02:18.600
Yeah, he's adorable.

03:02:18.600 --> 03:02:20.600
This color is just perfect.

03:02:20.600 --> 03:02:22.600
Everyone who meets him falls in love with him.

03:02:22.600 --> 03:02:24.600
They just surprised me with it for our vlog and made me keep it.

03:02:24.600 --> 03:02:26.600
We're gonna try and get some houses because we honestly want

03:02:26.600 --> 03:02:28.600
more. We just love this little guy so,

03:02:28.600 --> 03:02:30.600
so much. We just love him so much,

03:02:30.600 --> 03:02:32.600
and hopefully that'll show in here.

03:02:32.600 --> 03:02:34.600
We want two more. We want a little black one,

03:02:34.600 --> 03:02:36.600
and possibly a white one.

03:02:36.600 --> 03:02:38.600
I never asked for a dog. Oh my god, let's go get a dog.

03:02:38.600 --> 03:02:40.600
You wanna go what? You wanna go buy a dog today?

03:02:40.600 --> 03:02:42.600
I never asked for a dog. Can we get a dog? Oh my god.

03:02:42.600 --> 03:02:44.600
My dog was because of David and Jason.

03:02:44.600 --> 03:02:46.600
They just surprised me with it for our vlog and made me...

03:02:46.600 --> 03:02:48.600
Dude, it's so disturbing

03:02:48.600 --> 03:02:50.600
to me how she's openly lying.

03:02:50.600 --> 03:02:52.600
In this clip, Trisha's prior behavior

03:02:52.600 --> 03:02:54.600
appears to directly refute all available

03:02:54.600 --> 03:02:56.600
testimony that they articulated

03:02:56.600 --> 03:02:58.600
off enemies, leaving Ethan rather bemused,

03:02:58.600 --> 03:03:00.600
and even concerned as to Trisha's capability

03:03:00.600 --> 03:03:02.600
to expound mistruths.

03:03:02.600 --> 03:03:04.600
So disturbing to me

03:03:04.600 --> 03:03:06.600
how she's openly lying.

03:03:06.600 --> 03:03:08.600
She really convinced me

03:03:08.600 --> 03:03:10.600
of this dog lie.

03:03:10.600 --> 03:03:12.600
And she really successfully

03:03:12.600 --> 03:03:14.600
assassinated their character. Now, I mean

03:03:14.600 --> 03:03:16.600
this specifically has me questioning

03:03:16.600 --> 03:03:18.600
everything. And I

03:03:18.600 --> 03:03:20.600
can't help but wonder if I've just been a

03:03:20.600 --> 03:03:22.600
useful idiot to her this whole time.

03:03:22.600 --> 03:03:24.600
And the essay allegation about Dom, like

03:03:24.600 --> 03:03:26.600
all that stuff that was made publicly separate of her

03:03:26.600 --> 03:03:28.600
is like, you know, 100%

03:03:28.600 --> 03:03:30.600
believable. But like this dog thing

03:03:30.600 --> 03:03:32.600
like, I just feel like I've been the useful

03:03:32.600 --> 03:03:34.600
idiot to her the whole time to

03:03:34.600 --> 03:03:36.600
smear these people that she hates, because

03:03:36.600 --> 03:03:38.600
this is a flat out

03:03:38.600 --> 03:03:40.600
horrific lie to

03:03:40.600 --> 03:03:42.600
make about someone.

03:03:42.600 --> 03:03:44.600
In a way, this was the only significant

03:03:44.600 --> 03:03:46.600
development on the situation. Trisha's appearance

03:03:46.600 --> 03:03:48.600
on Mum's basement didn't really change the

03:03:48.600 --> 03:03:50.600
narratives too much. We knew what each party

03:03:50.600 --> 03:03:52.600
would probably say. We know where these people

03:03:52.600 --> 03:03:54.600
stand on each other. How this moment seemed to

03:03:54.600 --> 03:03:56.600
at least prompt a brief reassessment of the

03:03:56.600 --> 03:03:58.600
podcast by Ethan, and this reassessment

03:03:58.600 --> 03:04:00.600
would only yield more questions in the coming

03:04:00.600 --> 03:04:02.600
month. Trisha has commented on

03:04:02.600 --> 03:04:04.600
countless issues, and shared many anecdotes

03:04:04.600 --> 03:04:06.600
in extensive detail, often more detailed

03:04:06.600 --> 03:04:08.600
than a majority of people would ever be expected

03:04:08.600 --> 03:04:10.600
to recall. Some of these were related to

03:04:10.600 --> 03:04:12.600
YouTube dramas like the David de Brix saga,

03:04:12.600 --> 03:04:14.600
but there were also a lot of personal stories

03:04:14.600 --> 03:04:16.600
which they opened up about, and as a person with

03:04:16.600 --> 03:04:18.600
their own trauma, they would share some of these stories

03:04:18.600 --> 03:04:20.600
to an often very sympathetic audience.

03:04:20.600 --> 03:04:22.600
One of these stories that was particularly harrowing

03:04:22.600 --> 03:04:24.600
was about a teacher who had violated them while

03:04:24.600 --> 03:04:26.600
they were in school, an experience unfortunately

03:04:26.600 --> 03:04:28.600
a lot more common than we'd like it to be.

03:04:28.600 --> 03:04:30.600
At the time, it was a very powerful moment

03:04:30.600 --> 03:04:32.600
on the podcast, and they had a set of people

03:04:32.600 --> 03:04:34.600
surrounding them who were ready to support them.

03:04:34.600 --> 03:04:36.600
However, with some questions beginning to

03:04:36.600 --> 03:04:38.600
arise about Trisha's accuracy in delivering

03:04:38.600 --> 03:04:40.600
information, a new light was shone

03:04:40.600 --> 03:04:42.600
onto some of these allegations.

03:04:51.600 --> 03:04:54.600
September 2021 was a rough month.

03:04:54.600 --> 03:04:56.600
Trisha's decision to appear on mum's basement

03:04:56.600 --> 03:04:58.600
had already put a further strain on the family

03:04:58.600 --> 03:05:00.600
relationship, under burden from numerous

03:05:00.600 --> 03:05:02.600
incidents, some of which were documented on the H3 podcast.

03:05:22.600 --> 03:05:24.600
This had continuously manifested

03:05:24.600 --> 03:05:26.600
with other family members involving themselves,

03:05:26.600 --> 03:05:28.600
one of them being Moses Ackman,

03:05:28.600 --> 03:05:30.600
the individual who served as the keystone in the

03:05:30.600 --> 03:05:32.600
connection between the Klines and Patus.

03:05:32.600 --> 03:05:34.600
He had recently become more vocal in his

03:05:34.600 --> 03:05:36.600
participation after certain claims were made about

03:05:36.600 --> 03:05:38.600
his conduct, defending himself while also

03:05:38.600 --> 03:05:40.600
criticising Ethan for his behaviour.

03:05:40.600 --> 03:05:42.600
As both parties stewed in the fallout of the latest

03:05:42.600 --> 03:05:44.600
strife, questions were being raised about the story

03:05:44.600 --> 03:05:46.600
that Trisha had told on episode 17,

03:05:46.600 --> 03:05:48.600
the violation story.

03:05:54.600 --> 03:06:12.600
One of the details

03:06:12.600 --> 03:06:14.600
Trisha had divulged during this anecdote was that

03:06:14.600 --> 03:06:16.600
this teacher was eventually arrested on charges

03:06:16.600 --> 03:06:18.600
of CP. However, with some digging, certain

03:06:18.600 --> 03:06:20.600
people began to uncover information that disputed

03:06:20.600 --> 03:06:22.600
this claim. As a matter of fact, it was discovered

03:06:22.600 --> 03:06:24.600
that the teacher mentioned had retired from his role,

03:06:24.600 --> 03:06:26.600
passing on from this world in 2019.

03:06:26.600 --> 03:06:28.600
Along with other supposed inconsistencies,

03:06:28.600 --> 03:06:30.600
this was covered in a one and a half hour video

03:06:30.600 --> 03:06:32.600
uploaded by a creator called mysterious.

03:06:32.600 --> 03:06:34.600
Then the fourth time

03:06:34.600 --> 03:06:36.600
she mentions this same story is on

03:06:36.600 --> 03:06:38.600
TikTok on March 19th

03:06:38.600 --> 03:06:40.600
2021. This time, Trisha

03:06:40.600 --> 03:06:42.600
encourages her followers

03:06:42.600 --> 03:06:44.600
to search the teacher and look up his

03:06:44.600 --> 03:06:46.600
arrest. So Trisha specifically

03:06:46.600 --> 03:06:48.600
says that this teacher has been arrested.

03:06:48.600 --> 03:06:50.600
It seems legit, right? Surely if

03:06:50.600 --> 03:06:52.600
Trisha is encouraging their audience to

03:06:52.600 --> 03:06:54.600
look this up, it would pop right up when you

03:06:54.600 --> 03:06:56.600
search it. That isn't the case at all. In fact,

03:06:56.600 --> 03:06:58.600
when you Google exactly what Trisha says,

03:06:58.600 --> 03:07:00.600
this teacher does pop up under the

03:07:00.600 --> 03:07:02.600
top results, but it isn't because he was

03:07:02.600 --> 03:07:04.600
arrested. It was because he passed away

03:07:04.600 --> 03:07:06.600
in 2019 and his obituary

03:07:06.600 --> 03:07:08.600
pops up when you Google what she

03:07:08.600 --> 03:07:10.600
says. This observation began to

03:07:10.600 --> 03:07:12.600
garner traction in forums and comment sections

03:07:12.600 --> 03:07:14.600
with some calling on Ethan to amend the story

03:07:14.600 --> 03:07:16.600
with minor information available, and on the

03:07:16.600 --> 03:07:18.600
11th of September, he released a statement.

03:07:18.600 --> 03:07:20.600
This echoed much of what the concerned

03:07:20.600 --> 03:07:22.600
parties at the time were professing, that

03:07:22.600 --> 03:07:24.600
although it was not necessarily his place to

03:07:24.600 --> 03:07:26.600
discredit a survivor's story, he also couldn't

03:07:26.600 --> 03:07:28.600
keep that story up in good faith knowing the

03:07:28.600 --> 03:07:30.600
elements of it simply weren't true. Now

03:07:30.600 --> 03:07:32.600
it's completely fair to acknowledge that given how

03:07:32.600 --> 03:07:34.600
trauma affects memory and recalls certain

03:07:34.600 --> 03:07:36.600
events, it's possible that Trisha may have confused

03:07:36.600 --> 03:07:38.600
the details and names related to these

03:07:38.600 --> 03:07:40.600
accounts. However, with the previous contradictions

03:07:40.600 --> 03:07:42.600
in mind, it obviously occurred to

03:07:42.600 --> 03:07:44.600
Ethan that maybe there was the possibility

03:07:44.600 --> 03:07:46.600
that this version of events had been somewhat

03:07:46.600 --> 03:07:48.600
fabricated, and in that case, especially

03:07:48.600 --> 03:07:50.600
when dealing with criminal allegations, it's fair

03:07:50.600 --> 03:07:52.600
to err on the side of caution. Ethan had

03:07:52.600 --> 03:07:54.600
also followed up privately with Trisha,

03:07:54.600 --> 03:07:56.600
seeking clarification of these claims, with many

03:07:56.600 --> 03:07:58.600
audience members also publicly stating their

03:07:58.600 --> 03:08:00.600
desire for this to be addressed. How did they

03:08:00.600 --> 03:08:02.600
respond to this inquiry? Well, Trisha

03:08:02.600 --> 03:08:04.600
first found a deluge of tweets defending

03:08:04.600 --> 03:08:06.600
their mimosas from those who they felt were applying

03:08:06.600 --> 03:08:08.600
pressure, and feeling threatened by

03:08:08.600 --> 03:08:10.600
Ethan's turn, the DMs decided to share the messages

03:08:10.600 --> 03:08:12.600
themselves, and let people decide on

03:08:12.600 --> 03:08:14.600
who was behaving with the most decorum,

03:08:14.600 --> 03:08:16.600
and honestly, it's a dumpster fire, with

03:08:16.600 --> 03:08:18.600
everyone throwing blame at each other's feet.

03:08:18.600 --> 03:08:20.600
Ethan compels Trisha to make a public statement,

03:08:20.600 --> 03:08:22.600
and Trisha shares many posts that they believe

03:08:22.600 --> 03:08:24.600
were contributing to unnecessary harassment.

03:08:24.600 --> 03:08:26.600
Both Trisha and Ethan seem to use this

03:08:26.600 --> 03:08:28.600
accused individual's family in their narrative,

03:08:28.600 --> 03:08:30.600
Ethan in his post, and Trisha in the messages.

03:08:30.600 --> 03:08:32.600
It's hard to know what the family themselves

03:08:32.600 --> 03:08:34.600
want, but I'm not sure this is it.

03:08:34.600 --> 03:08:36.600
In the end, they become secondary to

03:08:36.600 --> 03:08:38.600
further allegations levelled towards Trisha's

03:08:38.600 --> 03:08:40.600
fiancé, Moses, which had been circulating

03:08:40.600 --> 03:08:42.600
recently as well. These allegations included

03:08:42.600 --> 03:08:44.600
stealthing, which, as I understand it, is the

03:08:44.600 --> 03:08:46.600
removal of the contraceptive device during

03:08:46.600 --> 03:08:48.600
sex, without the consent of the partner.

03:08:48.600 --> 03:08:50.600
Allegations also resurface surrounding

03:08:50.600 --> 03:08:52.600
Moses's intent to date Trisha in the first

03:08:52.600 --> 03:08:54.600
place, with some still wondering if he was just there

03:08:54.600 --> 03:08:56.600
for the money. He responds to some of these claims in a

03:08:56.600 --> 03:08:58.600
tweet longer where he asserts that the main complainant

03:08:58.600 --> 03:09:00.600
had an unhealthy obsession with him, which has

03:09:00.600 --> 03:09:02.600
subsequently warped their view, sharing

03:09:02.600 --> 03:09:04.600
DMs to supposedly substantiate this.

03:09:04.600 --> 03:09:06.600
It brings one person's motive into

03:09:06.600 --> 03:09:08.600
question, but it doesn't disprove the

03:09:08.600 --> 03:09:10.600
claims themselves, especially the ones made

03:09:10.600 --> 03:09:12.600
by others. With that said, it's hard to

03:09:12.600 --> 03:09:14.600
comment further when you don't know these people

03:09:14.600 --> 03:09:16.600
involved, and I honestly don't.

03:09:16.600 --> 03:09:18.600
However, in the DMs, Ethan

03:09:18.600 --> 03:09:20.600
expresses belief in the person levelling these

03:09:20.600 --> 03:09:22.600
accusations, and seems to imply that Trisha

03:09:22.600 --> 03:09:24.600
is being rather hypocritical in their stance.

03:09:24.600 --> 03:09:26.600
They express visible distress to the situation.

03:09:41.600 --> 03:09:43.600
This was clearly having a negative

03:09:43.600 --> 03:09:45.600
impact on others as well though, with Ethan

03:09:45.600 --> 03:09:47.600
announcing that he and Hila would be taking a week

03:09:47.600 --> 03:09:49.600
off the podcast in light of everything. The stress

03:09:49.600 --> 03:09:51.600
has just become too much for them to bear.

03:09:51.600 --> 03:09:53.600
At this point, although I think everyone was exhausted,

03:09:53.600 --> 03:09:55.600
people were by no means appeased, and

03:09:55.600 --> 03:09:57.600
remnants of the feud persisted over the following

03:09:57.600 --> 03:09:59.600
weeks, with a variety of people and media sources

03:09:59.600 --> 03:10:01.600
contributing their think pieces.

03:10:01.600 --> 03:10:03.600
Much of this occurred on fan forums, where

03:10:03.600 --> 03:10:05.600
one person shared a message from someone who claimed

03:10:05.600 --> 03:10:07.600
to be a former student at Trisha's school. They

03:10:07.600 --> 03:10:09.600
attested that although the teacher in question had

03:10:09.600 --> 03:10:11.600
been dismissed from their role for possibly

03:10:11.600 --> 03:10:13.600
disreputable behaviour, it wasn't related to his

03:10:13.600 --> 03:10:15.600
conduct towards the students specifically. Once again,

03:10:15.600 --> 03:10:17.600
this wasn't verified, and to be honest, it's quite

03:10:17.600 --> 03:10:19.600
hard to verify without people revealing private

03:10:19.600 --> 03:10:21.600
details, which most people aren't, but

03:10:21.600 --> 03:10:23.600
it was more food for thought. In response

03:10:23.600 --> 03:10:25.600
to Ethan's request and pressure from the public sphere,

03:10:25.600 --> 03:10:27.600
Trisha responded on the 15th of September,

03:10:27.600 --> 03:10:29.600
with a video titled Addressing Everything.

03:10:29.600 --> 03:10:31.600
I'm not going to go over the details

03:10:31.600 --> 03:10:33.600
specifically, but Trisha maintains their stories

03:10:33.600 --> 03:10:35.600
and in response to the new form narrative

03:10:35.600 --> 03:10:37.600
of their supposed lying, contends that

03:10:37.600 --> 03:10:39.600
knowingly lying is not the same as misspeaking,

03:10:39.600 --> 03:10:41.600
which is what they feel they did. They say

03:10:41.600 --> 03:10:43.600
they don't fact check and have a tendency to spew

03:10:43.600 --> 03:10:45.600
second hand information without actually

03:10:45.600 --> 03:10:47.600
understanding it themselves. They take responsibility

03:10:47.600 --> 03:10:49.600
for that, but they don't agree with the characterisations

03:10:49.600 --> 03:10:51.600
presented by many of their critics,

03:10:51.600 --> 03:10:53.600
especially those in the forums.

03:10:53.600 --> 03:10:55.600
There's a difference between misspeaking,

03:10:55.600 --> 03:10:57.600
hearing things, and not getting all the facts right, not fact

03:10:57.600 --> 03:10:59.600
checking, and

03:10:59.600 --> 03:11:01.600
versus sharing

03:11:01.600 --> 03:11:03.600
something you know to not be true for

03:11:03.600 --> 03:11:05.600
the malicious intent of tricking someone or

03:11:05.600 --> 03:11:07.600
making someone look bad.

03:11:07.600 --> 03:11:09.600
And so,

03:11:09.600 --> 03:11:11.600
I get stories

03:11:11.600 --> 03:11:13.600
mixed up, I hear things from people, and I don't fact check, and that

03:11:13.600 --> 03:11:15.600
was ultimately why I should never have had a podcast,

03:11:15.600 --> 03:11:17.600
I should never have been in front of me, but

03:11:17.600 --> 03:11:19.600
I'm not the only person in the world to

03:11:19.600 --> 03:11:21.600
do that. Having said that,

03:11:21.600 --> 03:11:23.600
I have never lied

03:11:23.600 --> 03:11:25.600
about

03:11:25.600 --> 03:11:27.600
any things that have happened to me.

03:11:27.600 --> 03:11:29.600
The truth is difficult sometimes,

03:11:29.600 --> 03:11:31.600
and sometimes we have to accept that we'll never

03:11:31.600 --> 03:11:33.600
know the truth fully. What you ultimately had was

03:11:33.600 --> 03:11:35.600
two very vehement factions, and when that

03:11:35.600 --> 03:11:37.600
arises, it can be difficult to deal with.

03:11:37.600 --> 03:11:39.600
It was certainly fostered in environments like Reddit

03:11:39.600 --> 03:11:41.600
where fans of one side tended to convene.

03:11:41.600 --> 03:11:43.600
I don't think it's completely fair to say that because

03:11:43.600 --> 03:11:45.600
someone misplaced details, the whole

03:11:45.600 --> 03:11:47.600
story is false, but at the same time,

03:11:47.600 --> 03:11:49.600
Trisha's response still didn't placate the criticism

03:11:49.600 --> 03:11:51.600
relating to stories where there was contradictory

03:11:51.600 --> 03:11:53.600
evidence available. In a way,

03:11:53.600 --> 03:11:55.600
no two situations are the same, and

03:11:55.600 --> 03:11:57.600
they shouldn't be treated as such, even if

03:11:57.600 --> 03:11:59.600
someone is an unreliable narrator, but when

03:11:59.600 --> 03:12:01.600
the accusations at hand were becoming so

03:12:01.600 --> 03:12:03.600
sensitive, the tensions were only flaring

03:12:03.600 --> 03:12:05.600
further. As Trisha said while defending

03:12:05.600 --> 03:12:07.600
Moses, people can lie,

03:12:07.600 --> 03:12:09.600
and the question was whether that person

03:12:09.600 --> 03:12:11.600
was Trisha.

03:12:17.600 --> 03:12:19.600
In the week after their video,

03:12:19.600 --> 03:12:21.600
Trisha removed over 1000 videos

03:12:21.600 --> 03:12:23.600
from their channel, cleansing approximately

03:12:23.600 --> 03:12:25.600
1 billion views of their work, and the week

03:12:25.600 --> 03:12:27.600
after, Ethan announced the start of their new

03:12:27.600 --> 03:12:29.600
collaborative project with the less controversial

03:12:29.600 --> 03:12:31.600
Hassan Piker. Less controversial.

03:12:37.600 --> 03:12:39.600
With the family connection also firmly

03:12:39.600 --> 03:12:41.600
intact, as it would be fair to assume that this

03:12:41.600 --> 03:12:43.600
would end the drama, especially with Ethan

03:12:43.600 --> 03:12:45.600
seemingly making a commitment to withdraw from

03:12:45.600 --> 03:12:47.600
discussing Trisha, and Trisha seemingly wanting

03:12:47.600 --> 03:12:49.600
the drama to be over. However, a lot of

03:12:49.600 --> 03:12:51.600
internet criticism persisted, particularly

03:12:51.600 --> 03:12:53.600
the two sides who wanted to portray

03:12:53.600 --> 03:12:55.600
the other side as dishonest, because what we

03:12:55.600 --> 03:12:57.600
saw was a stalemate, which meant

03:12:57.600 --> 03:12:59.600
fans felt completely free to make assumptions

03:12:59.600 --> 03:13:01.600
about the characters of people they were criticising.

03:13:01.600 --> 03:13:03.600
After being referenced in Ethan's stream, accounts

03:13:03.600 --> 03:13:05.600
dedicated to publicising alleged inconsistencies

03:13:05.600 --> 03:13:07.600
such as contradictions of Trish

03:13:07.600 --> 03:13:09.600
on TikTok began to pick up traction,

03:13:09.600 --> 03:13:11.600
only further creating groundswell around these

03:13:11.600 --> 03:13:13.600
narratives. The account raises interesting points,

03:13:13.600 --> 03:13:15.600
though at the same time, some of these clips

03:13:15.600 --> 03:13:17.600
are a decade apart and are considerate of the fact

03:13:17.600 --> 03:13:19.600
that people's perspectives change, but

03:13:19.600 --> 03:13:21.600
we'll come to that in a moment.

03:13:21.600 --> 03:13:23.600
Besides that, there were still occasional illusions

03:13:23.600 --> 03:13:25.600
to each other's existence, and with Trisha's upcoming

03:13:25.600 --> 03:13:27.600
marriage to Moses, it was hard to keep them both

03:13:27.600 --> 03:13:29.600
out of mind too much, particularly when such

03:13:29.600 --> 03:13:31.600
an event would usually bring the family together.

03:13:47.600 --> 03:13:49.600
On December 10th, in a stream the day before

03:13:49.600 --> 03:13:51.600
Trisha's wedding, Ethan made a comment in passing

03:13:51.600 --> 03:13:53.600
that tomorrow was Hila's birthday,

03:13:53.600 --> 03:13:55.600
which would have been the 11th. However,

03:13:55.600 --> 03:13:57.600
Hila's birthday is actually on the 12th. This caused

03:13:57.600 --> 03:13:59.600
some of Trisha's fandom to claim that Ethan and

03:13:59.600 --> 03:14:01.600
Hila were lying about their birthday, to purposely

03:14:01.600 --> 03:14:03.600
draw more hate towards Trisha, as some

03:14:03.600 --> 03:14:05.600
other fans had also been claiming that Trisha was

03:14:05.600 --> 03:14:07.600
purposely mimicking impactful dates of the

03:14:07.600 --> 03:14:09.600
clients in a continued attempt to provoke them.

03:14:15.600 --> 03:14:17.600
Going over the stream, it seems that Ethan may be

03:14:17.600 --> 03:14:19.600
celebrating Hila's birthday on a Saturday, as he

03:14:19.600 --> 03:14:21.600
declares that he's recording another episode of Leftovers,

03:14:21.600 --> 03:14:23.600
the one with Hasan Biker, on the Sunday.

03:14:23.600 --> 03:14:25.600
It'd be one hell of a way to try and rile

03:14:25.600 --> 03:14:27.600
his fans up, though as shown, many audience

03:14:27.600 --> 03:14:29.600
members' perspectives were so cynical that

03:14:29.600 --> 03:14:31.600
they couldn't help but theorise if every comment

03:14:31.600 --> 03:14:33.600
had an underlying meaning. It's unsure whether

03:14:33.600 --> 03:14:35.600
either party believed that the other was taking

03:14:35.600 --> 03:14:37.600
backhanded jabs at them, but this all seemed to

03:14:37.600 --> 03:14:39.600
boil over when Trisha posted a rather tone-deaf

03:14:39.600 --> 03:14:41.600
TikTok barely a few days after the wedding.

03:14:41.600 --> 03:14:51.600
I mean, tone-deaf

03:14:51.600 --> 03:14:53.600
is one way to put it, but it is just ridiculous

03:14:53.600 --> 03:14:55.600
that they thought this was a good idea.

03:14:55.600 --> 03:14:57.600
I mean, it's not an active admission that it's

03:14:57.600 --> 03:14:59.600
what they did, but it's a pretty heavy inference.

03:14:59.600 --> 03:15:01.600
I can't really see any other punchline

03:15:01.600 --> 03:15:03.600
there, I'm pretty sure those dance moves

03:15:03.600 --> 03:15:05.600
don't directly relate to Judaism, unless

03:15:05.600 --> 03:15:07.600
they're implying that such seductive dance moves

03:15:07.600 --> 03:15:09.600
are payment, but I have to admit I'm not familiar

03:15:09.600 --> 03:15:11.600
with that currency either. Either way, it's

03:15:11.600 --> 03:15:13.600
anti-Semitic, and Ethan, displeased with this,

03:15:13.600 --> 03:15:15.600
decided to break his vow of silence and directly

03:15:15.600 --> 03:15:17.600
address Trisha in a response.

03:15:17.600 --> 03:15:19.600
So you say you couldn't finish your

03:15:19.600 --> 03:15:21.600
conversion classes, which

03:15:21.600 --> 03:15:23.600
tells me that you don't care

03:15:23.600 --> 03:15:25.600
enough about the culture to put in the

03:15:25.600 --> 03:15:27.600
actual work to do it the right way,

03:15:27.600 --> 03:15:29.600
and then you say that you just paid off a

03:15:29.600 --> 03:15:31.600
rabbi to just say you're

03:15:31.600 --> 03:15:33.600
Jewish, which is, first of all, a lie,

03:15:33.600 --> 03:15:35.600
no rabbi would do that, and second of all,

03:15:35.600 --> 03:15:37.600
anti-Semitic, because it just propagates

03:15:37.600 --> 03:15:39.600
the notion that Jews only care about

03:15:39.600 --> 03:15:41.600
money, and that's very

03:15:41.600 --> 03:15:43.600
serious, you know, the whole

03:15:43.600 --> 03:15:45.600
thing is just disgusting,

03:15:45.600 --> 03:15:47.600
frankly, and if you don't want me to

03:15:47.600 --> 03:15:49.600
stitch your anti-Semitic TikToks,

03:15:49.600 --> 03:15:51.600
then turn Stitch off, I don't want to hear you

03:15:51.600 --> 03:15:53.600
bitch about that, and the worst thing

03:15:53.600 --> 03:15:55.600
about all this is that there's people

03:15:55.600 --> 03:15:57.600
around you that know better.

03:15:57.600 --> 03:15:59.600
One of these was done on TikTok where it explains how

03:15:59.600 --> 03:16:01.600
Trisha was harmfully stereotyping those from his

03:16:01.600 --> 03:16:03.600
religion, have a clearly feeling like he had not

03:16:03.600 --> 03:16:05.600
contributed enough to the discourse, decided to

03:16:05.600 --> 03:16:07.600
dedicate a section of his off-the-rails soundbite

03:16:07.600 --> 03:16:09.600
stream to Trisha's comments, explaining

03:16:09.600 --> 03:16:11.600
that with the wedding behind them, he had no reason

03:16:11.600 --> 03:16:13.600
to hold back, attacking both Trisha,

03:16:13.600 --> 03:16:15.600
Moses, and everyone else in the blast radius.

03:16:15.600 --> 03:16:17.600
It seemed like a pretty cathartic experience

03:16:17.600 --> 03:16:19.600
for him all in all. The soundbite of Trisha's

03:16:19.600 --> 03:16:21.600
sister discussing the 5%

03:16:21.600 --> 03:16:23.600
subsequently won the bitterly fought knockout

03:16:23.600 --> 03:16:25.600
tournament, seemingly becoming immortalised

03:16:25.600 --> 03:16:27.600
in H3 history.

03:16:27.600 --> 03:16:29.600
Oh!

03:16:29.600 --> 03:16:31.600
Oh!

03:16:31.600 --> 03:16:33.600
17,000 votes

03:16:33.600 --> 03:16:35.600
take that 5%, has gained

03:16:35.600 --> 03:16:37.600
the lead, 51% take that

03:16:37.600 --> 03:16:39.600
5%, it's all

03:16:39.600 --> 03:16:41.600
unfolding. It is all

03:16:41.600 --> 03:16:43.600
unfolding here at the

03:16:43.600 --> 03:16:45.600
2021 H3.

03:16:45.600 --> 03:16:47.600
He takes that 5%.

03:16:47.600 --> 03:16:49.600
I'm speechless folks. It's clear that

03:16:49.600 --> 03:16:51.600
although he hadn't spoke about the matter publicly for a

03:16:51.600 --> 03:16:53.600
couple months, he hadn't stopped thinking about it.

03:16:53.600 --> 03:16:55.600
As he had come equipped with a plethora of evidence

03:16:55.600 --> 03:16:57.600
and anecdotes to combat the narrative

03:16:57.600 --> 03:16:59.600
propounded by Trish and those around them.

03:16:59.600 --> 03:17:01.600
In fact, this is arguably his most ruthless

03:17:01.600 --> 03:17:03.600
stream of them all, showing very little regard

03:17:03.600 --> 03:17:05.600
for the backlash that he may instigate, and revealing

03:17:05.600 --> 03:17:07.600
some rather personal details about

03:17:07.600 --> 03:17:09.600
Trisha.

03:17:25.600 --> 03:17:27.600
I don't owe any

03:17:27.600 --> 03:17:29.600
shit to anybody. And actually the

03:17:29.600 --> 03:17:31.600
worst part is that Moses knows better.

03:17:31.600 --> 03:17:33.600
I mean, he's f***ing enabling

03:17:33.600 --> 03:17:35.600
straight up anti-Semitic

03:17:35.600 --> 03:17:37.600
harmful tropes, making

03:17:37.600 --> 03:17:39.600
a mockery of the religion, and

03:17:39.600 --> 03:17:41.600
it's f***ing disgusting and they should both be

03:17:41.600 --> 03:17:43.600
deeply ashamed and f*** them both. Peace

03:17:43.600 --> 03:17:45.600
and love. By the way, this is coming

03:17:45.600 --> 03:17:47.600
from the girl who did like

03:17:47.600 --> 03:17:49.600
has done OF videos with her

03:17:49.600 --> 03:17:51.600
whole f***ing family. So don't

03:17:51.600 --> 03:17:53.600
feign like that you're so outraged

03:17:53.600 --> 03:17:55.600
by this candle story.

03:17:55.600 --> 03:17:57.600
You know, I mean, Kaylee,

03:17:57.600 --> 03:17:59.600
if you were so worried about your mom

03:17:59.600 --> 03:18:01.600
not knowing the intimate details of your

03:18:01.600 --> 03:18:03.600
sex life, don't make

03:18:03.600 --> 03:18:05.600
OF videos with her, you

03:18:05.600 --> 03:18:07.600
f***ing freak.

03:18:07.600 --> 03:18:09.600
And by the way,

03:18:09.600 --> 03:18:11.600
people have dug up so many videos of Trisha

03:18:11.600 --> 03:18:13.600
and Kaylee talking

03:18:13.600 --> 03:18:15.600
with like really

03:18:15.600 --> 03:18:17.600
detailed questions

03:18:17.600 --> 03:18:19.600
about sex

03:18:19.600 --> 03:18:21.600
with their mom.

03:18:21.600 --> 03:18:23.600
Like disgusting, weird

03:18:23.600 --> 03:18:25.600
shit that I would never in a million years

03:18:25.600 --> 03:18:27.600
want to discuss. So you know what, Kaylee?

03:18:29.600 --> 03:18:31.600
That wedding is over.

03:18:31.600 --> 03:18:33.600
F*** you and your whole family.

03:18:33.600 --> 03:18:35.600
How about that?

03:18:35.600 --> 03:18:37.600
F*** you and the womb you came

03:18:37.600 --> 03:18:39.600
out of.

03:18:39.600 --> 03:18:41.600
How

03:18:41.600 --> 03:18:43.600
about that, Kaylee?

03:18:43.600 --> 03:18:45.600
And once I asked

03:18:45.600 --> 03:18:47.600
once I

03:18:47.600 --> 03:18:49.600
asked Moses if

03:18:49.600 --> 03:18:51.600
she ever asked him to pretend

03:18:51.600 --> 03:18:53.600
like he's Hila, and he said

03:18:53.600 --> 03:18:55.600
yes, but he refuses to.

03:18:55.600 --> 03:18:57.600
Well, if you ask Moses, they're all

03:18:57.600 --> 03:18:59.600
water, so incest is fine.

03:18:59.600 --> 03:19:01.600
All sex is the best to Moses

03:19:01.600 --> 03:19:03.600
when everyone's water. He's like, hey, it's

03:19:03.600 --> 03:19:05.600
all good, baby. Defense of like why-

03:19:05.600 --> 03:19:07.600
I deleted it after I was up, after

03:19:07.600 --> 03:19:09.600
everyone was telling me how f***ing dumb of a

03:19:09.600 --> 03:19:11.600
take it was, but it was-

03:19:11.600 --> 03:19:13.600
but everybody already downloaded it.

03:19:13.600 --> 03:19:15.600
You already said it, and you tried some shit.

03:19:15.600 --> 03:19:17.600
It ain't my f***ing

03:19:17.600 --> 03:19:19.600
fault. You're an influencer. Don't act like you're not.

03:19:19.600 --> 03:19:21.600
She is. She's been on the

03:19:21.600 --> 03:19:23.600
videos. She has her own OF

03:19:23.600 --> 03:19:25.600
account. She's

03:19:25.600 --> 03:19:27.600
she's an internet personality. I don't give up.

03:19:27.600 --> 03:19:29.600
So

03:19:29.600 --> 03:19:35.600
got 5% of an operating brain.

03:19:35.600 --> 03:19:37.600
Oh boy.

03:19:39.600 --> 03:19:41.600
I was bottled up. What can I do?

03:19:41.600 --> 03:19:43.600
Ethan isn't a person who necessarily

03:19:43.600 --> 03:19:45.600
abides by the internet's code of honour

03:19:45.600 --> 03:19:47.600
for the time, and whereas the milder individuals

03:19:47.600 --> 03:19:49.600
who spectate this may find its savagery

03:19:49.600 --> 03:19:51.600
a bit disconcerting, Ethan seems to be

03:19:51.600 --> 03:19:53.600
under the impression that this is his justice

03:19:53.600 --> 03:19:55.600
for all the times he has felt wronged by

03:19:55.600 --> 03:19:57.600
Trisha's behaviour, their lies, their manipulation.

03:19:57.600 --> 03:19:59.600
This was his chance to deliver that

03:19:59.600 --> 03:20:01.600
blow. However, Trisha obviously didn't

03:20:01.600 --> 03:20:03.600
respond well, releasing a video pleading with him

03:20:03.600 --> 03:20:05.600
to leave her alone, calling both Ethan and

03:20:05.600 --> 03:20:07.600
Ela obsessed, and basically every other word under

03:20:07.600 --> 03:20:09.600
the sun that would frame them as a victim to the client's

03:20:09.600 --> 03:20:11.600
endless tirade of abuse.

03:20:11.600 --> 03:20:13.600
Every little jab,

03:20:13.600 --> 03:20:15.600
every video

03:20:15.600 --> 03:20:17.600
he's made obsessing about me.

03:20:17.600 --> 03:20:19.600
It always

03:20:19.600 --> 03:20:21.600
scares me.

03:20:21.600 --> 03:20:23.600
The backlash I receive from

03:20:23.600 --> 03:20:25.600
their subreddit and their fans

03:20:25.600 --> 03:20:27.600
to Ethan himself just

03:20:27.600 --> 03:20:29.600
obsessing over

03:20:29.600 --> 03:20:31.600
every little thing I do.

03:20:31.600 --> 03:20:33.600
Meanwhile, Ethan can't stop talking about

03:20:33.600 --> 03:20:35.600
me. Can't stop getting

03:20:35.600 --> 03:20:37.600
bans and strikes going off on Twitter

03:20:37.600 --> 03:20:39.600
on just random people blocking his

03:20:39.600 --> 03:20:41.600
content and just being so angry

03:20:41.600 --> 03:20:43.600
and

03:20:43.600 --> 03:20:45.600
lawsuits and all this stuff like that.

03:20:45.600 --> 03:20:47.600
And I get it.

03:20:47.600 --> 03:20:49.600
I get he's probably himself

03:20:49.600 --> 03:20:51.600
in a dark place right now. Like, I really could

03:20:51.600 --> 03:20:53.600
see that. I was like, I know he's in a dark

03:20:53.600 --> 03:20:55.600
place, so OK, I'll take a couple jabs.

03:20:55.600 --> 03:20:57.600
But this F them and

03:20:57.600 --> 03:20:59.600
anti-Semitic and Moses enabling, talking

03:20:59.600 --> 03:21:01.600
about Moses, talking about my sister, people

03:21:01.600 --> 03:21:03.600
who literally did nothing in

03:21:03.600 --> 03:21:05.600
this situation and bringing my

03:21:05.600 --> 03:21:07.600
sister again, just

03:21:07.600 --> 03:21:09.600
knowing he's inciting

03:21:09.600 --> 03:21:11.600
all of this.

03:21:11.600 --> 03:21:13.600
It went from having the

03:21:13.600 --> 03:21:15.600
absolute best weekend

03:21:15.600 --> 03:21:17.600
of my life

03:21:17.600 --> 03:21:19.600
to this and everyone,

03:21:19.600 --> 03:21:21.600
my family and Moses and

03:21:21.600 --> 03:21:23.600
oh, he wants a reaction. Don't let him

03:21:23.600 --> 03:21:25.600
get this reaction. And I'm like,

03:21:25.600 --> 03:21:27.600
don't let him know that he ruined your

03:21:27.600 --> 03:21:29.600
best weekend. I said, but he did.

03:21:29.600 --> 03:21:31.600
He won. Like, can you

03:21:31.600 --> 03:21:33.600
stop now? Please.

03:21:33.600 --> 03:21:35.600
Like, please.

03:21:35.600 --> 03:21:37.600
In this case, unlike previous

03:21:37.600 --> 03:21:39.600
videos, Ethan relented and cut out

03:21:39.600 --> 03:21:41.600
a large proportion of his Trisha rant.

03:21:41.600 --> 03:21:43.600
It's also important to note that Ethan

03:21:43.600 --> 03:21:45.600
was facing a pretty harsh set of characterisations

03:21:45.600 --> 03:21:47.600
from an individual known as Ryan

03:21:47.600 --> 03:21:49.600
Cavanagh, who had initiated a lawsuit against

03:21:49.600 --> 03:21:51.600
the client. His lawsuit mentions Trisha by

03:21:51.600 --> 03:21:53.600
name and frames them as a victim of

03:21:53.600 --> 03:21:55.600
Ethan's actions. Ethan had been vocal about

03:21:55.600 --> 03:21:57.600
the stress this lawsuit had caused him and may

03:21:57.600 --> 03:21:59.600
have not wanted to increase any risk of

03:21:59.600 --> 03:22:01.600
defeat, given that the case explicitly

03:22:01.600 --> 03:22:03.600
mentions defamation on multiple

03:22:03.600 --> 03:22:05.600
occasions. Ryan had also been blocking

03:22:05.600 --> 03:22:07.600
many of Ethan's videos which he had tweeted

03:22:07.600 --> 03:22:09.600
about around the time, and not too long after

03:22:09.600 --> 03:22:11.600
he was again blocked from uploading after an

03:22:11.600 --> 03:22:13.600
old video was supposedly mass reported

03:22:13.600 --> 03:22:15.600
by trolls. Once more,

03:22:15.600 --> 03:22:17.600
Ethan announced that he would take another break

03:22:17.600 --> 03:22:19.600
even after having the strike removed.

03:22:19.600 --> 03:22:21.600
It seemed that his attempt to close out this story

03:22:21.600 --> 03:22:23.600
was opening more new wounds.

03:22:23.600 --> 03:22:25.600
But why? Well,

03:22:25.600 --> 03:22:27.600
because there's no situation

03:22:27.600 --> 03:22:29.600
with Trisha in which you can win.

03:22:35.600 --> 03:22:37.600
If

03:22:37.600 --> 03:22:39.600
the contradictions of Trish's

03:22:39.600 --> 03:22:41.600
TikTok account and other commentators

03:22:41.600 --> 03:22:43.600
highlighted something, it's that Trisha

03:22:43.600 --> 03:22:45.600
is probably the most inconsistent person

03:22:45.600 --> 03:22:47.600
online. Now I divide these

03:22:47.600 --> 03:22:49.600
inconsistencies into three components,

03:22:49.600 --> 03:22:51.600
personal evolution, small

03:22:51.600 --> 03:22:53.600
talk disparities, and inexplicable

03:22:53.600 --> 03:22:55.600
lies. For example,

03:22:55.600 --> 03:22:57.600
People asking about nanny and a bar mitzvah,

03:22:57.600 --> 03:22:59.600
you know it's hard to say, it's hard to say until it happens,

03:22:59.600 --> 03:23:01.600
like I would like to try

03:23:01.600 --> 03:23:03.600
obviously without a nanny, I really

03:23:03.600 --> 03:23:05.600
don't judge anyone that has them. When I have a kid,

03:23:05.600 --> 03:23:07.600
I'm not gonna have nannies, that's pretty damn sure. What does that mean?

03:23:07.600 --> 03:23:09.600
You're trying to attack our parental

03:23:09.600 --> 03:23:11.600
abilities? There's something wrong with having a nanny?

03:23:11.600 --> 03:23:13.600
My eyes, yes.

03:23:13.600 --> 03:23:15.600
This one isn't really a direct contradiction,

03:23:15.600 --> 03:23:17.600
especially with the context that at the time

03:23:17.600 --> 03:23:19.600
they were trying to spite Ethan. It could just

03:23:19.600 --> 03:23:21.600
be Trisha coming round to the idea of a nanny

03:23:21.600 --> 03:23:23.600
and the possible merits to it, especially as

03:23:23.600 --> 03:23:25.600
they are now pregnant. Small talk

03:23:25.600 --> 03:23:27.600
disparity, on the other hand, doesn't really

03:23:27.600 --> 03:23:29.600
show much growth between conflicting

03:23:29.600 --> 03:23:31.600
statements, but also could be explained

03:23:31.600 --> 03:23:33.600
by the fact that Trisha is someone who talks a lot

03:23:33.600 --> 03:23:35.600
and their opinions seem to fluctuate

03:23:35.600 --> 03:23:37.600
rather turbulently, but also ultimately

03:23:37.600 --> 03:23:39.600
too inconsequential to care about.

03:23:39.600 --> 03:23:41.600
The content people seemed most alarmed by

03:23:41.600 --> 03:23:43.600
was the inexplicable lies, statements

03:23:43.600 --> 03:23:45.600
that seemed impossible to make sense of

03:23:45.600 --> 03:23:47.600
in the context of how the truth appeared.

03:23:47.600 --> 03:23:49.600
My dog was because of David and Jason, they just surprised me

03:23:49.600 --> 03:23:51.600
with it for a vlog and made me keep it even though I never asked

03:23:51.600 --> 03:23:53.600
for a dog. And yes, we did talk about this,

03:23:53.600 --> 03:23:55.600
but everyone was like, oh my god, you can't just surprise me with a

03:23:55.600 --> 03:23:57.600
puppy, I have been wanting a puppy for a

03:23:57.600 --> 03:23:59.600
really long time. We had talked about it for

03:23:59.600 --> 03:24:01.600
a while that I wanted a Pomeranian, that my mom

03:24:01.600 --> 03:24:03.600
would help me take care of it. Just to be clear, we did

03:24:03.600 --> 03:24:05.600
talk about this and the plan was to

03:24:05.600 --> 03:24:07.600
maybe give the dog to Trisha's

03:24:07.600 --> 03:24:09.600
mom who really wants a Pomeranian. This was first brought into

03:24:09.600 --> 03:24:11.600
context by the puppy clip, and although

03:24:11.600 --> 03:24:13.600
certain falsehoods like the allegations against

03:24:13.600 --> 03:24:15.600
a schoolteacher could be put down to confusion,

03:24:15.600 --> 03:24:17.600
others like that relating to the puppy

03:24:17.600 --> 03:24:19.600
are much harder to explain. Where's the

03:24:19.600 --> 03:24:21.600
ambiguity there? Trisha said something

03:24:21.600 --> 03:24:23.600
that was just apparently objectively

03:24:23.600 --> 03:24:25.600
false, and that's far from the only example.

03:24:25.600 --> 03:24:27.600
I said earlier that Trisha was most at ease

03:24:27.600 --> 03:24:29.600
when firing off information and stories about topics

03:24:29.600 --> 03:24:31.600
that interest them. That was when the

03:24:31.600 --> 03:24:33.600
podcast ran at its smoothest, but it was only

03:24:33.600 --> 03:24:35.600
because it was what made viewers and colleagues

03:24:35.600 --> 03:24:37.600
feel most comfortable.

03:24:49.600 --> 03:24:51.600
It's confusing and hard to really

03:24:51.600 --> 03:24:53.600
understand, because you're often left thinking

03:24:53.600 --> 03:24:55.600
why would you even need to lie about something

03:24:55.600 --> 03:24:57.600
as trivial as that, but it's very difficult

03:24:57.600 --> 03:24:59.600
to come to any other conclusion than that

03:24:59.600 --> 03:25:01.600
this was intentional, but then the question

03:25:01.600 --> 03:25:03.600
comes down to what motive causes

03:25:03.600 --> 03:25:05.600
a person to state inaccuracies like

03:25:05.600 --> 03:25:07.600
Trisha does, not just about one detail

03:25:07.600 --> 03:25:09.600
or the other, but in general. Well, a simple

03:25:09.600 --> 03:25:11.600
response would be that Trisha is a troll,

03:25:11.600 --> 03:25:13.600
and they have been trolling long throughout their YouTube

03:25:13.600 --> 03:25:15.600
career. On one hand, yes, this is

03:25:15.600 --> 03:25:17.600
true, Trisha has been a notorious troll

03:25:17.600 --> 03:25:19.600
since the early days of this platform, but on the other

03:25:19.600 --> 03:25:21.600
hand, it seemed that trolling was a bit

03:25:21.600 --> 03:25:23.600
more identifiable, particularly in the

03:25:23.600 --> 03:25:25.600
narratives and the tone. It was also something that

03:25:25.600 --> 03:25:27.600
Trisha claimed to have left behind them on a fair

03:25:27.600 --> 03:25:29.600
few occasions when discussing it.

03:25:53.600 --> 03:26:13.600
This was not

03:26:13.600 --> 03:26:15.600
just a relationship that enabled Trisha

03:26:15.600 --> 03:26:17.600
to post a few videos, this was a

03:26:17.600 --> 03:26:19.600
fully fledged business partnership that generated

03:26:19.600 --> 03:26:21.600
significant income for our prima

03:26:21.600 --> 03:26:23.600
donna. It precipitated a romantic bond

03:26:23.600 --> 03:26:25.600
that produced a marriage and a pregnancy

03:26:25.600 --> 03:26:27.600
for all that to be a troll would require some

03:26:27.600 --> 03:26:29.600
mastermind level preparation and

03:26:29.600 --> 03:26:31.600
emotional robustness, that even Trisha

03:26:31.600 --> 03:26:33.600
in all their longevity and fortitude

03:26:33.600 --> 03:26:35.600
may not be capable of. What's the

03:26:35.600 --> 03:26:37.600
alternative explanation then?

03:26:37.600 --> 03:26:39.600
Well, I think the idea of Trisha being a troll

03:26:39.600 --> 03:26:41.600
is reductionist. A troll is known to actively

03:26:41.600 --> 03:26:43.600
carry out undesirable actions for attention,

03:26:43.600 --> 03:26:45.600
and although Trisha has done that, they're not

03:26:45.600 --> 03:26:47.600
just a lover of negative attention.

03:26:47.600 --> 03:26:49.600
Trisha has a way of inserting themselves into

03:26:49.600 --> 03:26:51.600
stories that makes them relevant to the situation

03:26:51.600 --> 03:26:53.600
at hand. I think if any of the perceived

03:26:53.600 --> 03:26:55.600
contradictions highlight a common factor,

03:26:55.600 --> 03:26:57.600
these are often situations where the people who Trisha

03:26:57.600 --> 03:26:59.600
may be commenting on are unlikely to respond

03:26:59.600 --> 03:27:01.600
on a public platform in a way that may

03:27:01.600 --> 03:27:03.600
illuminate these lies, either because they are

03:27:03.600 --> 03:27:05.600
broad in drama that contains valid criticisms

03:27:05.600 --> 03:27:07.600
so they struggle to respond in general, or they

03:27:07.600 --> 03:27:09.600
literally can't respond. Trisha's

03:27:09.600 --> 03:27:11.600
stories always seem to be rooted in

03:27:11.600 --> 03:27:13.600
some grain of truth, but it's hard to know

03:27:13.600 --> 03:27:15.600
exactly what followed.

03:27:19.600 --> 03:27:35.600
One of the curious stories Trisha told back

03:27:35.600 --> 03:27:37.600
in the day was about an interaction with

03:27:37.600 --> 03:27:39.600
famous actor Robin Williams, who passed

03:27:39.600 --> 03:27:41.600
on from this world far too soon. Trisha

03:27:41.600 --> 03:27:43.600
stated that when they worked as a courtesan,

03:27:43.600 --> 03:27:45.600
they'd pass across. This story was

03:27:45.600 --> 03:27:47.600
recounted on their channel not too long after

03:27:47.600 --> 03:27:49.600
Robin's passing, and repeated on the podcast

03:27:49.600 --> 03:27:51.600
where Trisha brings it up, and then seems

03:27:51.600 --> 03:27:53.600
hesitant to elaborate further.

03:28:17.600 --> 03:28:25.600
Now once again with the

03:28:25.600 --> 03:28:27.600
legacy of Robin Williams, and the awareness

03:28:27.600 --> 03:28:29.600
that we have of his often complicated

03:28:29.600 --> 03:28:31.600
and problematic character, it's not

03:28:31.600 --> 03:28:33.600
in the realms of impossibility. At the

03:28:33.600 --> 03:28:35.600
same time, it's another situation which

03:28:35.600 --> 03:28:37.600
involves an admittedly rather unlikely

03:28:37.600 --> 03:28:39.600
scenario with only one available source.

03:28:39.600 --> 03:28:41.600
This is the case with a fair few

03:28:41.600 --> 03:28:43.600
other public figures, and even private

03:28:43.600 --> 03:28:45.600
ones. Although in many cases these stories

03:28:45.600 --> 03:28:47.600
are mostly inconsequential, the discomfort

03:28:47.600 --> 03:28:49.600
from Ethan's perspective was that he believed

03:28:49.600 --> 03:28:51.600
he was used to prop up a false

03:28:51.600 --> 03:28:53.600
portrait of someone, and it's not

03:28:53.600 --> 03:28:55.600
hard to see why. It's important

03:28:55.600 --> 03:28:57.600
not to understate the more sophisticated

03:28:57.600 --> 03:28:59.600
aspect relating to Trisha's understanding

03:28:59.600 --> 03:29:01.600
of internet culture. Trisha isn't

03:29:01.600 --> 03:29:03.600
someone who just exists to lie, they

03:29:03.600 --> 03:29:05.600
have desires and aspirations. I think

03:29:05.600 --> 03:29:07.600
in this case the podcast provided platform

03:29:07.600 --> 03:29:09.600
for Trisha to tell a new story that would

03:29:09.600 --> 03:29:11.600
contextualise their behaviour, that would almost

03:29:11.600 --> 03:29:13.600
be this new chapter in their life.

03:29:13.600 --> 03:29:15.600
Trisha knows what to do to maximise

03:29:15.600 --> 03:29:17.600
their attention, and although in the past the

03:29:17.600 --> 03:29:19.600
best way to do this was through often

03:29:19.600 --> 03:29:21.600
shallow provocation, here it was

03:29:21.600 --> 03:29:23.600
actually to create a deeper, more sympathetic

03:29:23.600 --> 03:29:25.600
portrait, one that would make them look

03:29:25.600 --> 03:29:27.600
more human and have the audience rooting for

03:29:27.600 --> 03:29:29.600
them. Many people would have that naturally

03:29:29.600 --> 03:29:31.600
within their character, but with Trisha it's

03:29:31.600 --> 03:29:33.600
like another persona for each moment.

03:29:33.600 --> 03:29:35.600
Trisha nature to adapt to situations

03:29:35.600 --> 03:29:37.600
and bring themselves to the forefront of conversation

03:29:37.600 --> 03:29:39.600
is so prominent that they couldn't help

03:29:39.600 --> 03:29:41.600
but misrepresent certain situations, while

03:29:41.600 --> 03:29:43.600
spectators looked on and nodded their head.

03:29:43.600 --> 03:29:45.600
When Trisha was caught up in lies before

03:29:45.600 --> 03:29:47.600
in their first appearance on the H3

03:29:47.600 --> 03:29:49.600
podcast, when the lies were quite

03:29:49.600 --> 03:29:51.600
obvious, people didn't feel so threatened

03:29:51.600 --> 03:29:53.600
by them, but as people bought into

03:29:53.600 --> 03:29:55.600
the greater story in its entirety

03:29:55.600 --> 03:29:57.600
the impact clearly affected people

03:29:57.600 --> 03:29:59.600
more significantly. While the

03:29:59.600 --> 03:30:01.600
podcast was running smoothly, everything

03:30:01.600 --> 03:30:03.600
went well for them, their platform was used

03:30:03.600 --> 03:30:05.600
and it's clear that many began to fall in

03:30:05.600 --> 03:30:07.600
love with the Trisha they thought they were becoming

03:30:07.600 --> 03:30:09.600
familiar with, and because they deemed Trisha

03:30:09.600 --> 03:30:11.600
a likeable individual, very few

03:30:11.600 --> 03:30:13.600
questioned these stories. I don't know

03:30:13.600 --> 03:30:15.600
Trisha inside out to say without a shadow

03:30:15.600 --> 03:30:17.600
of a doubt that they actively, intently

03:30:17.600 --> 03:30:19.600
lied, but they

03:30:19.600 --> 03:30:21.600
did not tell the truth, and in the months

03:30:21.600 --> 03:30:23.600
following it was clear that Ethan grew bitter

03:30:23.600 --> 03:30:25.600
believing that he had been duped into providing

03:30:25.600 --> 03:30:27.600
a platform for someone to speak so carelessly

03:30:27.600 --> 03:30:29.600
and using his trust to provide an

03:30:29.600 --> 03:30:31.600
extra veneer of credibility,

03:30:31.600 --> 03:30:33.600
but that's only one perspective.

03:30:33.600 --> 03:30:35.600
What's the other? How much blame

03:30:35.600 --> 03:30:37.600
can we assign to Trisha

03:30:37.600 --> 03:30:39.600
and how much can we assign elsewhere?

03:31:07.600 --> 03:31:17.600
In the kind of months after their

03:31:17.600 --> 03:31:19.600
pre-Christmas battle, though Ethan and Hila

03:31:19.600 --> 03:31:21.600
had mostly cleaned up their legal obligations

03:31:21.600 --> 03:31:23.600
relating to Ryan Cavanagh, the release of certain

03:31:23.600 --> 03:31:25.600
pressures didn't draw them back to the topic of

03:31:25.600 --> 03:31:27.600
Trisha, other than a few subtweets,

03:31:27.600 --> 03:31:29.600
likely because Ethan going full mask off wasn't

03:31:29.600 --> 03:31:31.600
actually a rewarding experience.

03:31:31.600 --> 03:31:33.600
Trisha did what many expect, and put Ethan in a

03:31:33.600 --> 03:31:35.600
position where if he said any more, he'd be the

03:31:35.600 --> 03:31:37.600
aggressor, he'd be the one unduly

03:31:37.600 --> 03:31:39.600
ruining a person's honeymoon, yet

03:31:39.600 --> 03:31:41.600
many were still frustrated, pointing towards

03:31:41.600 --> 03:31:43.600
all the times that Trisha had spoken endlessly

03:31:43.600 --> 03:31:45.600
about Frenemies after they broke up,

03:31:45.600 --> 03:31:47.600
but unfortunately, they're not quite

03:31:47.600 --> 03:31:49.600
the same, are they? One is

03:31:49.600 --> 03:31:51.600
Ethan, and one is Trisha.

03:31:51.600 --> 03:31:53.600
Many of the accounts that we've used today,

03:31:53.600 --> 03:31:55.600
and many of the people who've taken to call Trisha

03:31:55.600 --> 03:31:57.600
out for their behaviour during Frenemies, were

03:31:57.600 --> 03:31:59.600
completely on board only months before,

03:31:59.600 --> 03:32:01.600
despite the fact that many of Trisha's comments

03:32:01.600 --> 03:32:03.600
were firstly made on Frenemies, and made long

03:32:03.600 --> 03:32:05.600
before Frenemies, statements that were well known

03:32:05.600 --> 03:32:07.600
and acknowledged at the time.

03:32:07.600 --> 03:32:09.600
In many ways, Trisha's demeanour always strangled

03:32:09.600 --> 03:32:11.600
the line of trolling master seriousness,

03:32:11.600 --> 03:32:13.600
and people expressing outrage at this shouldn't

03:32:13.600 --> 03:32:15.600
necessarily be that surprised.

03:32:15.600 --> 03:32:17.600
Trisha did exactly what they normally do.

03:32:17.600 --> 03:32:19.600
Isn't this what we expected to happen

03:32:19.600 --> 03:32:21.600
anyway? In Trisha's first collaboration

03:32:21.600 --> 03:32:23.600
with the clients, they were called out for specifically

03:32:23.600 --> 03:32:25.600
lying about a rather important detail

03:32:25.600 --> 03:32:27.600
relating to drama. Surely, it was obvious

03:32:27.600 --> 03:32:29.600
that this was a pattern.

03:32:29.600 --> 03:32:31.600
This channel called

03:32:31.600 --> 03:32:33.600
Psych In Real Life, they did how Frenemies

03:32:33.600 --> 03:32:35.600
reveals a mental health misconception

03:32:35.600 --> 03:32:37.600
perpetuated by the internet. This was a really good one.

03:32:37.600 --> 03:32:39.600
This was someone who was in our favour.

03:32:39.600 --> 03:32:41.600
Some people are in our favour that we

03:32:41.600 --> 03:32:43.600
show the ugly side of BBT.

03:32:43.600 --> 03:32:45.600
They're like, you know what? Everyone's a mental health

03:32:45.600 --> 03:32:47.600
advocate until it's ugly, and so...

03:32:47.600 --> 03:32:49.600
So another theory

03:32:49.600 --> 03:32:51.600
began to arise, and although I don't think

03:32:51.600 --> 03:32:53.600
it's the most popular one, I think it's worth

03:32:53.600 --> 03:32:55.600
addressing nonetheless, particularly given the

03:32:55.600 --> 03:32:57.600
undercurrents of mental health. As discussed

03:32:57.600 --> 03:32:59.600
earlier, many felt that given Trisha's noted

03:32:59.600 --> 03:33:01.600
instability, responsibility ultimately fell on

03:33:01.600 --> 03:33:03.600
Ethan for platforming them in the first place.

03:33:03.600 --> 03:33:05.600
While the initial appeals of Frenemies was

03:33:05.600 --> 03:33:07.600
that Trisha Paytas was such an interesting

03:33:07.600 --> 03:33:09.600
character, and that they often lacked a filter,

03:33:09.600 --> 03:33:11.600
and would say stuff that people do deem offensive,

03:33:11.600 --> 03:33:13.600
Trisha never deviated from how they were

03:33:13.600 --> 03:33:15.600
known to behave, so why was it fair to

03:33:15.600 --> 03:33:17.600
treat them any other way? I think the

03:33:17.600 --> 03:33:19.600
problem is that this ultimately arose

03:33:19.600 --> 03:33:21.600
from the desire to keep the podcast together.

03:33:21.600 --> 03:33:23.600
Friendly bias, and some of Dr. Drew's

03:33:23.600 --> 03:33:25.600
less helpful advice. Ethan did obviously

03:33:25.600 --> 03:33:27.600
treat Trisha differently when they were a part

03:33:27.600 --> 03:33:29.600
of the podcast. Although he was no pushover,

03:33:29.600 --> 03:33:31.600
he didn't really treat Trisha's worst

03:33:31.600 --> 03:33:33.600
comments with the seriousness that they could have

03:33:33.600 --> 03:33:35.600
been treated as a critic, or even

03:33:35.600 --> 03:33:37.600
as a friend, and some would even say that

03:33:37.600 --> 03:33:39.600
he almost left people to observe it like a

03:33:39.600 --> 03:33:41.600
specimen under a microscope. It was

03:33:41.600 --> 03:33:43.600
part of the theatre, it could easily blur

03:33:43.600 --> 03:33:45.600
the lines between melodrama and serious

03:33:45.600 --> 03:33:47.600
disputes. In the months after, it

03:33:47.600 --> 03:33:49.600
became easy to view what seemed like

03:33:49.600 --> 03:33:51.600
melodrama at the time in a much more serious

03:33:51.600 --> 03:33:53.600
light, and many did, but losing

03:33:53.600 --> 03:33:55.600
perspective of the original context they were

03:33:55.600 --> 03:33:57.600
viewed in. Exposing Trisha Paytas

03:33:57.600 --> 03:33:59.600
is such a strange concept because everyone

03:33:59.600 --> 03:34:01.600
knows so much

03:34:01.600 --> 03:34:03.600
and so little about them at the same time,

03:34:03.600 --> 03:34:05.600
and I don't know what you

03:34:05.600 --> 03:34:07.600
could say about Trisha Paytas

03:34:07.600 --> 03:34:09.600
that would surprise me. I spoke

03:34:09.600 --> 03:34:11.600
earlier about Ethan's bias, and I think it's

03:34:11.600 --> 03:34:13.600
what made him a contentious figure.

03:34:13.600 --> 03:34:15.600
During the Keemstar Girlfriend drama, a clip

03:34:15.600 --> 03:34:17.600
began to circulate of what he said to Boogie,

03:34:17.600 --> 03:34:19.600
another creator on the older side who'd had

03:34:19.600 --> 03:34:21.600
an interaction with a younger girl, and Ethan's

03:34:21.600 --> 03:34:23.600
supposedly differing perspective.

03:34:51.600 --> 03:34:59.600
Now this

03:34:59.600 --> 03:35:01.600
once again harkens back to the hypocrisy

03:35:01.600 --> 03:35:03.600
narrative that many assert, however I think

03:35:03.600 --> 03:35:05.600
it more shows how often Ethan projects his

03:35:05.600 --> 03:35:07.600
judgement of character onto an action

03:35:07.600 --> 03:35:09.600
that many others may refrain from making assumptions

03:35:09.600 --> 03:35:11.600
about. Ethan believes that Keemstar

03:35:11.600 --> 03:35:13.600
is an inherently opportunistic, shady

03:35:13.600 --> 03:35:15.600
individual, probably many worse words,

03:35:15.600 --> 03:35:17.600
and therefore, from Ethan's perspective,

03:35:17.600 --> 03:35:19.600
Keem's attraction to younger adults

03:35:19.600 --> 03:35:21.600
is based on something more insidious than if it

03:35:21.600 --> 03:35:23.600
was an action carried out by someone he had more

03:35:23.600 --> 03:35:25.600
respect for. The only issue is that Ethan

03:35:25.600 --> 03:35:27.600
often doesn't elaborate on this himself

03:35:27.600 --> 03:35:29.600
and uses general logic that could be

03:35:29.600 --> 03:35:31.600
applied to any of these situations, and

03:35:31.600 --> 03:35:33.600
therefore, for people who don't think it's fair to

03:35:33.600 --> 03:35:35.600
cross-apply those assumptions, these positions

03:35:35.600 --> 03:35:37.600
will seem conflicting. I think

03:35:37.600 --> 03:35:39.600
the Trisha fallout showed that friend-enemy

03:35:39.600 --> 03:35:41.600
dichotomy that Ethan clearly experienced,

03:35:41.600 --> 03:35:43.600
and in a way, it makes sense,

03:35:43.600 --> 03:35:45.600
someone who you may perceive charitably may have

03:35:45.600 --> 03:35:47.600
their faux pas viewed as requiring

03:35:47.600 --> 03:35:49.600
education. However, if you come to the conclusion

03:35:49.600 --> 03:35:51.600
that actually that person is not well-meaning,

03:35:51.600 --> 03:35:53.600
then you may think that they already have the

03:35:53.600 --> 03:35:55.600
education, they're just discarding it.

03:35:55.600 --> 03:35:57.600
With that said, it is a distinct polarity,

03:35:57.600 --> 03:35:59.600
and although some would say that Trisha

03:35:59.600 --> 03:36:01.600
certainly poked Ethan until he bit back,

03:36:01.600 --> 03:36:03.600
others would argue he unquestionably gave a platform

03:36:03.600 --> 03:36:05.600
for a person who was known for their falsehoods

03:36:05.600 --> 03:36:07.600
and then adopted a victimhood narrative

03:36:07.600 --> 03:36:09.600
when those falsehoods were turned against him.

03:36:09.600 --> 03:36:11.600
It's not hard to wonder if the famous

03:36:11.600 --> 03:36:13.600
episode 17 would have even been

03:36:13.600 --> 03:36:15.600
considered for deletion if friend-enemies never

03:36:15.600 --> 03:36:17.600
split up. As we've seen, it's very difficult

03:36:17.600 --> 03:36:19.600
to use Trisha's words against them

03:36:19.600 --> 03:36:21.600
because you don't know what's real and what isn't.

03:36:21.600 --> 03:36:23.600
The truth is, no viewer or audience member

03:36:23.600 --> 03:36:25.600
will ever truly know who Trisha

03:36:25.600 --> 03:36:27.600
Paytas is or what they believe, because they

03:36:27.600 --> 03:36:29.600
throw out so many statements that makes me question

03:36:29.600 --> 03:36:31.600
if they know what they believe themselves

03:36:31.600 --> 03:36:33.600
half the time. With this in mind, I think

03:36:33.600 --> 03:36:35.600
some commentators and critics of

03:36:35.600 --> 03:36:37.600
Klein and their fanbase found the long-term

03:36:37.600 --> 03:36:39.600
reaction to the collapse of friend-enemies

03:36:39.600 --> 03:36:41.600
slightly inauthentic. Trisha had

03:36:41.600 --> 03:36:43.600
alluded to this narrative as well, regularly

03:36:43.600 --> 03:36:45.600
claiming people only cared about certain

03:36:45.600 --> 03:36:47.600
actions after they were antagonized by

03:36:47.600 --> 03:36:49.600
the audience, and although somewhat inaccurate

03:36:49.600 --> 03:36:51.600
I can understand the gist of it.

03:36:51.600 --> 03:36:53.600
In essence, they're saying people like Ethan

03:36:53.600 --> 03:36:55.600
only wanted the drama, only wanted

03:36:55.600 --> 03:36:57.600
the controversy, only wanted

03:36:57.600 --> 03:36:59.600
the tea and the hot takes as long as

03:36:59.600 --> 03:37:01.600
Trisha was part of the podcast. Ethan

03:37:01.600 --> 03:37:03.600
isn't stupid, and he's very outspoken about

03:37:03.600 --> 03:37:05.600
the people he doesn't like and thinks should probably

03:37:05.600 --> 03:37:07.600
be deplatformed for their behaviour, such as

03:37:07.600 --> 03:37:09.600
Keemstar. Although these two did one

03:37:09.600 --> 03:37:11.600
episode actually a very long time ago, Ethan

03:37:11.600 --> 03:37:13.600
has repeatedly refused to share a

03:37:13.600 --> 03:37:15.600
platform with him since, citing Keem's

03:37:15.600 --> 03:37:17.600
behaviour as examples for why.

03:37:17.600 --> 03:37:19.600
Some would argue that much of the stuff

03:37:19.600 --> 03:37:21.600
that Trisha had done prior to the podcast

03:37:21.600 --> 03:37:23.600
was no less concerning, yet they were

03:37:23.600 --> 03:37:25.600
still taken on. How come?

03:37:41.600 --> 03:37:43.600
Like, I get why he would think

03:37:43.600 --> 03:37:45.600
that, you know what I mean? Because it's like

03:37:45.600 --> 03:37:47.600
every week, you know, it's like I

03:37:47.600 --> 03:37:49.600
have, I'm transgender, I'm just

03:37:49.600 --> 03:37:51.600
I have personality disorder

03:37:51.600 --> 03:37:53.600
and so people start to

03:37:53.600 --> 03:37:55.600
think like, what is

03:37:55.600 --> 03:37:57.600
really going on here? I get it.

03:37:57.600 --> 03:37:59.600
I'm not mad about it, but Anthony Padilla of all

03:37:59.600 --> 03:38:01.600
people, Mr. Fucking Woke, if there's

03:38:01.600 --> 03:38:03.600
something wrong with someone, which there clearly is, let's say

03:38:03.600 --> 03:38:05.600
I am, let's say I have a pathological liar

03:38:05.600 --> 03:38:07.600
and there's some fucking disorder where I'm just like always needing

03:38:07.600 --> 03:38:09.600
attention, like I have something wrong with me,

03:38:09.600 --> 03:38:11.600
don't fucking attack someone because something's wrong, how about

03:38:11.600 --> 03:38:13.600
get that person fucking help? How about butt out

03:38:13.600 --> 03:38:15.600
because there's probably other people helping. People don't know

03:38:15.600 --> 03:38:17.600
fucking shit when it comes to this stuff.

03:38:17.600 --> 03:38:19.600
Well, I suppose more cynical viewers would assume

03:38:19.600 --> 03:38:21.600
that once again it comes down in part

03:38:21.600 --> 03:38:23.600
to control. Unlike a collaboration

03:38:23.600 --> 03:38:25.600
with Keemstar, for example, Ethan had

03:38:25.600 --> 03:38:27.600
an idea of how a podcast with Trisha could

03:38:27.600 --> 03:38:29.600
go. He had relative control of it on his

03:38:29.600 --> 03:38:31.600
platform, and at the time there was a notion

03:38:31.600 --> 03:38:33.600
of that greater evil for both parties

03:38:33.600 --> 03:38:35.600
to combat. Trisha did what Trisha was

03:38:35.600 --> 03:38:37.600
brought on to do, and people catered to them,

03:38:37.600 --> 03:38:39.600
and supported them, and although there were conflicts,

03:38:39.600 --> 03:38:41.600
they were regularly brought back not too long after

03:38:41.600 --> 03:38:43.600
with the expectation that if Trisha could be

03:38:43.600 --> 03:38:45.600
kept happy, the podcast would continue.

03:38:45.600 --> 03:38:47.600
Some might even say that Trisha's behaviour

03:38:47.600 --> 03:38:49.600
was enabled by an environment that valued

03:38:49.600 --> 03:38:51.600
their presence over the actual truth,

03:38:51.600 --> 03:38:53.600
despite the fact that this contradictory evidence

03:38:53.600 --> 03:38:55.600
was available during many of the discussions

03:38:55.600 --> 03:38:57.600
they held. Trisha is an

03:38:57.600 --> 03:38:59.600
autonomous adult, and therefore has to bear some

03:38:59.600 --> 03:39:01.600
responsibilities for their statements. However,

03:39:01.600 --> 03:39:03.600
if their inconsistency has been as consistent

03:39:03.600 --> 03:39:05.600
as it's made out to be, some would claim

03:39:05.600 --> 03:39:07.600
that Ethan isn't as innocent as people

03:39:07.600 --> 03:39:09.600
might assume, that he must have had some awareness

03:39:09.600 --> 03:39:11.600
of what he signed himself up for,

03:39:11.600 --> 03:39:13.600
but didn't mind as long as he had control

03:39:13.600 --> 03:39:15.600
of the environment that Trisha existed in,

03:39:15.600 --> 03:39:17.600
as long as the narrative was on his side.

03:39:17.600 --> 03:39:19.600
I do have a premonition

03:39:19.600 --> 03:39:21.600
that I'm like, I feel like I'm gonna be like a Jimmy Fallon

03:39:21.600 --> 03:39:23.600
and I'm gonna just have to leave this show and I feel bad

03:39:23.600 --> 03:39:25.600
because you're so nice to me.

03:39:25.600 --> 03:39:27.600
You're gonna move up,

03:39:27.600 --> 03:39:29.600
you're gonna ascend to late night

03:39:29.600 --> 03:39:31.600
and say, Ethan, I'm sorry,

03:39:33.600 --> 03:39:35.600
we've had a good thing,

03:39:35.600 --> 03:39:37.600
but I have to leave you behind.

03:39:37.600 --> 03:39:39.600
Eventually we're gonna have to part ways, and when is that gonna happen

03:39:39.600 --> 03:39:41.600
and what's gonna happen, like I'll feel bad if that's you

03:39:41.600 --> 03:39:43.600
like what if, you know what I mean?

03:39:43.600 --> 03:39:45.600
I'm pretty content,

03:39:45.600 --> 03:39:47.600
I'm not looking to move up anywhere.

03:39:47.600 --> 03:39:49.600
That's the problem with me,

03:39:49.600 --> 03:39:51.600
I'm never content, I always think I'm gonna be doing better

03:39:51.600 --> 03:39:53.600
and bigger things.

03:39:53.600 --> 03:39:55.600
Some would always believe that Ethan just wanted to use

03:39:55.600 --> 03:39:57.600
Trisha's controversial persona for the click based on the views,

03:39:57.600 --> 03:39:59.600
without real regard for the place

03:39:59.600 --> 03:40:01.600
that Trisha's inconsistencies and outbursts

03:40:01.600 --> 03:40:03.600
came from. And although Trisha did consent,

03:40:03.600 --> 03:40:05.600
was Trisha too in love with the attention

03:40:05.600 --> 03:40:07.600
to even process the situation rationally?

03:40:07.600 --> 03:40:09.600
Was it really responsible to provide

03:40:09.600 --> 03:40:11.600
them with that space anyway?

03:40:11.600 --> 03:40:13.600
Maybe Ethan only wanted Trisha for as long

03:40:13.600 --> 03:40:15.600
as they played the part they wanted,

03:40:15.600 --> 03:40:17.600
and the moment they attempted to take more control

03:40:17.600 --> 03:40:19.600
was the moment they were no longer useful.

03:40:19.600 --> 03:40:21.600
This is all just speculation,

03:40:21.600 --> 03:40:23.600
and a reflection of how people view

03:40:23.600 --> 03:40:25.600
the situation quite cynically.

03:40:25.600 --> 03:40:27.600
And I want to make that click,

03:40:27.600 --> 03:40:29.600
but it often did latch onto one key factor

03:40:29.600 --> 03:40:31.600
of the podcast, particularly one with

03:40:31.600 --> 03:40:33.600
such notable personalities,

03:40:33.600 --> 03:40:35.600
and that is control.

03:40:35.600 --> 03:40:37.600
So what did that control come down to?

03:40:37.600 --> 03:40:39.600
Well, one statistic springs

03:40:39.600 --> 03:40:41.600
to mind.

03:41:09.600 --> 03:41:11.600
Okay, fine. And so we had to buy

03:41:11.600 --> 03:41:13.600
But that was the first time we ever spent money on production costs.

03:41:13.600 --> 03:41:15.600
It's not about that, dude.

03:41:15.600 --> 03:41:17.600
It's literally about we are producing the show

03:41:17.600 --> 03:41:19.600
and I'm taking a cut. I feel like that's

03:41:19.600 --> 03:41:21.600
beyond reasonable.

03:41:21.600 --> 03:41:23.600
Beyond reasonable.

03:41:23.600 --> 03:41:25.600
5%. Do you realize how much 5% was of our last one?

03:41:25.600 --> 03:41:43.600
As said, it's very hard to distinguish Trisha's true beliefs from the ones they push for provocative purposes.

03:41:43.600 --> 03:41:47.600
There was one situation which I do feel represented Trisha's opinions from a fairly genuine perspective,

03:41:47.600 --> 03:41:51.600
as it was one where their behaviour didn't benefit this arc of attention.

03:41:51.600 --> 03:41:53.600
That is arguably the most memed issue of it all,

03:41:53.600 --> 03:41:55.600
the 5% and what it represented.

03:41:55.600 --> 03:41:59.600
Although Trisha is a person who often isn't completely honest with what they think or how they feel,

03:41:59.600 --> 03:42:01.600
it's never without a greater motive,

03:42:01.600 --> 03:42:03.600
and in absence of a trolling motive,

03:42:03.600 --> 03:42:05.600
we have to ask ourselves,

03:42:05.600 --> 03:42:07.600
what is so important about 5%?

03:42:07.600 --> 03:42:09.600
In her whole family,

03:42:09.600 --> 03:42:11.600
it's like they're all just sitting there counting the 5%.

03:42:11.600 --> 03:42:13.600
It takes that 5%.

03:42:13.600 --> 03:42:15.600
You got her whole family, you're just like,

03:42:15.600 --> 03:42:17.600
the 5%.

03:42:17.600 --> 03:42:19.600
That's a small number!

03:42:19.600 --> 03:42:21.600
1, 2, 3, 4, 5!

03:42:21.600 --> 03:42:23.600
Out of 100!

03:42:23.600 --> 03:42:25.600
So 100 numbers, that's 5 of them!

03:42:25.600 --> 03:42:29.600
Now the quotes and jokes run deep, and rightfully so.

03:42:29.600 --> 03:42:31.600
I don't think there's anyone who believes that with the production costs,

03:42:31.600 --> 03:42:35.600
Trisha and Ethan's profits should have been split completely evenly.

03:42:35.600 --> 03:42:39.600
However, I do think the banter has often clouded the core points that were trying to be made,

03:42:39.600 --> 03:42:41.600
but weren't completely unfounded.

03:42:41.600 --> 03:42:43.600
It also reflects the ultimate flaw in the structure of Frenemies,

03:42:43.600 --> 03:42:45.600
and the dynamic between Ethan and Trisha.

03:42:45.600 --> 03:42:49.600
Both parties purported a sense of betrayal when discussing the capitulation of the partnership,

03:42:49.600 --> 03:42:53.600
but they both gave a lot to be on the podcast before being thrown under the bus by the other,

03:42:53.600 --> 03:42:58.600
and maybe this was because that in later episodes they seemed to become much more comfortable with each other.

03:42:58.600 --> 03:43:00.600
Trisha was invited on the podcast by Ethan,

03:43:00.600 --> 03:43:03.600
with Ethan owning all the production resources and investing in it himself.

03:43:03.600 --> 03:43:05.600
Therefore, although it was hosted by both of them,

03:43:05.600 --> 03:43:09.600
there was the steadying hand of Ethan to keep the show afloat under all circumstances,

03:43:09.600 --> 03:43:12.600
which made sense given Trisha's unpredictable tendencies,

03:43:12.600 --> 03:43:16.600
however it also meant that Trisha was almost always a guest on their own podcast.

03:43:16.600 --> 03:43:19.600
Although their outbursts often resulted in certain concessions,

03:43:19.600 --> 03:43:22.600
it also reminded people that their presence was still unreliable,

03:43:22.600 --> 03:43:25.600
and didn't give them any stead to expect more control over production.

03:43:25.600 --> 03:43:29.600
However, 35 episodes in, and half a year since the last serious quarrel,

03:43:29.600 --> 03:43:35.600
I think Trisha believed that they had become enough of a mainstay to expect a bit more authority over the direction of the podcast.

03:43:35.600 --> 03:43:37.600
The girl that he cheated on with is Ava Louise Girl.

03:43:37.600 --> 03:43:40.600
He called her a gremlin. It's like, you fucked her.

03:43:40.600 --> 03:43:41.600
Go off, Queen.

03:43:41.600 --> 03:43:42.600
You can't fuck- I hate- I hate-

03:43:42.600 --> 03:43:43.600
Go the fuck off.

03:43:43.600 --> 03:43:45.600
Guys fuck girls, and because they got caught or whatever,

03:43:45.600 --> 03:43:47.600
then they call the girl the gremlin and stuff like that,

03:43:47.600 --> 03:43:51.600
like, oh, she was good enough to suck your dick, like what are you talk- Mike is such a woman hater,

03:43:51.600 --> 03:43:52.600
and he hates sex workers.

03:43:52.600 --> 03:43:53.600
Go off. Go off.

03:43:53.600 --> 03:43:55.600
You can see this by Lana, he's cheated on her,

03:43:55.600 --> 03:43:58.600
he's like publicly admitted to it in a game, saying he got head from people,

03:43:58.600 --> 03:43:59.600
like he's so- he-

03:43:59.600 --> 03:44:00.600
Oh, you know what?

03:44:00.600 --> 03:44:04.600
This is the kind of guy that virtual reality has to get head from somebody

03:44:04.600 --> 03:44:06.600
over in fucking Florida or wherever the fuck they are.

03:44:06.600 --> 03:44:07.600
Go off.

03:44:07.600 --> 03:44:10.600
And thinking that's cool, like, oh yeah, baby, give me- like, you are such a loser.

03:44:10.600 --> 03:44:11.600
You fucked up, Mike.

03:44:11.600 --> 03:44:14.600
You are some perfect example of small dick energy that you need a virtual person to suck your dick.

03:44:14.600 --> 03:44:16.600
You psychopath.

03:44:16.600 --> 03:44:20.600
It's no secret that they read the comments, and reception had really turned in the prior months.

03:44:20.600 --> 03:44:21.600
One issue remained, though.

03:44:21.600 --> 03:44:23.600
How are they to bring up this point of discourse?

03:44:23.600 --> 03:44:27.600
Well, Trisha has a way of not bringing up specifically what they want,

03:44:27.600 --> 03:44:32.600
rather pushing discussion in a direction that will eventually result in their desirable proposition.

03:44:32.600 --> 03:44:35.600
In that final episode, it was a problem that clearly bothered them,

03:44:35.600 --> 03:44:37.600
which is why they attacked the production aspect,

03:44:37.600 --> 03:44:41.600
eventually escalating the situation to the point where the episode ended prematurely.

03:44:41.600 --> 03:44:46.600
However, the 5% narrative in my mind was Trisha's logical entry point to this discussion,

03:44:46.600 --> 03:44:48.600
and a clear signifier of what they wanted.

03:44:48.600 --> 03:44:52.600
Basically, Trisha's point was that, as it wasn't 50-50 exactly,

03:44:52.600 --> 03:44:57.600
because that 5% came from their own share, they deserved more influence in the decisions being made.

03:44:57.600 --> 03:45:00.600
Ultimately, I disagree with this specific line of logic,

03:45:00.600 --> 03:45:05.600
and I think you have to look more at the share from the perspective that this 5% was nobody's money to begin with.

03:45:05.600 --> 03:45:09.600
However, I also think there was a case to be made for Trisha to have more of a say in certain decisions,

03:45:09.600 --> 03:45:12.600
regardless of the money, because Frenemies was presented as a joint project,

03:45:12.600 --> 03:45:14.600
and they were part of the appeal,

03:45:14.600 --> 03:45:18.600
but that discussion didn't happen because of how Trisha subsequently handled it.

03:45:18.600 --> 03:45:22.600
Now, the tinfoil hat guy in me would question how much of Trisha's outburst was calculated,

03:45:22.600 --> 03:45:25.600
and I really can't say for certain in that case.

03:45:25.600 --> 03:45:30.600
However, I would go as far to say that I think their announcement to step down was done with almost the opposite intent.

03:45:30.600 --> 03:45:34.600
With people's desire to keep the podcast together, and the result of previous tantrums,

03:45:34.600 --> 03:45:40.600
Trisha had every reason to believe that actually them standing down would prompt Ethan to do everything he could to keep the podcast together,

03:45:40.600 --> 03:45:46.600
possibly having another Dr Drew episode which results in Drew recommending Trisha has more representation on the podcast,

03:45:46.600 --> 03:45:50.600
and Ethan abiding by the expert advice. However, that did not happen.

03:45:50.600 --> 03:45:56.600
The 5%, as amusing as it was, became that primary narrative to show that from Trisha's perspective,

03:45:56.600 --> 03:46:01.600
they never really had any control, and for a podcast that they featured on, in their eyes that wasn't fair.

03:46:01.600 --> 03:46:06.600
In my opinion, Trisha didn't want the extra 5%, they just wanted what it represented.

03:46:06.600 --> 03:46:11.600
In the videos following the collapse of the podcast, Trisha emphasised that from their perspective their input wasn't valued enough,

03:46:11.600 --> 03:46:17.600
and although certain points they made were contradicted pretty directly, once again bringing that intent into question,

03:46:17.600 --> 03:46:22.600
I do think there was a tension that neither of them wanted to address until after they didn't have an obligation to each other.

03:46:22.600 --> 03:46:27.600
Both Trisha and Ethan sought to emphasise how much they cared about each other, and I don't doubt that's true,

03:46:27.600 --> 03:46:30.600
but I guess the question would be how much did they trust each other?

03:46:30.600 --> 03:46:33.600
One clip from Ethan's video in particular seems quite relevant.

03:46:33.600 --> 03:46:43.600
So she wants me to hire people, lease in industrial space, of which, by the way, the leases are usually 3 plus years on industrial spaces,

03:46:43.600 --> 03:46:51.600
for something that she's inevitably gonna quit. Like, I mean, it's happened 3 times already, so like,

03:46:51.600 --> 03:46:55.600
and guess who's gonna take all the risk on that? Me. I'm gonna risk my ass.

03:46:55.600 --> 03:47:00.600
Here he states he didn't want to hand over more authority to Trisha in the say of the staff because from his perspective,

03:47:00.600 --> 03:47:04.600
he was the anchor, and Trisha could walk out at any time without experiencing any repercussions.

03:47:04.600 --> 03:47:11.600
This is true, but in a way he walks himself into cyclical reasoning, because what he says is only true because Trisha walked out

03:47:11.600 --> 03:47:16.600
because of that specific reason, in which case Trisha would just reply, well that's where the 5% of my cut comes in.

03:47:16.600 --> 03:47:21.600
Now as said, I don't necessarily agree with Trisha that a cut should give them a stronger say, necessarily,

03:47:21.600 --> 03:47:26.600
I think it's much more to do with trust, but in this case all you do is prove that you ultimately didn't trust them,

03:47:26.600 --> 03:47:31.600
and you can turn around and say, well they walked out, which proves that I shouldn't have given them a greater input anyway,

03:47:31.600 --> 03:47:36.600
but if they walked out on the basis of that specific issue, then it doesn't really prove your point,

03:47:36.600 --> 03:47:40.600
because Trisha would continuously push the idea that they were prepared to take more responsibility,

03:47:40.600 --> 03:47:45.600
and that Klein would not grant them that. That was the significance of the 5% in their mind.

03:47:45.600 --> 03:47:50.600
As noted earlier, there were some who found Trisha's nature to compare themselves with Ila Klein concerting,

03:47:50.600 --> 03:47:53.600
some even going as far to suggest that Trisha was concealing feelings for Ethan themselves.

03:47:54.600 --> 03:48:00.600
I wouldn't say that, but what I would say is that Ethan and Ila were able to launch the H3 podcast with the mutual trust

03:48:00.600 --> 03:48:05.600
that a married couple would invest in themselves. I think Trisha wanted that feeling of partnership as well,

03:48:05.600 --> 03:48:10.600
they wanted that even split, even leadership, even management, even power, ultimately though deep down

03:48:10.600 --> 03:48:15.600
they knew that wasn't something that Ethan would ever be prepared to provide, and that just exposed those doubts once more,

03:48:15.600 --> 03:48:21.600
and how they interpreted them. The core disagreement was this, Trisha clearly believed that Frenemies had outgrown

03:48:21.600 --> 03:48:26.600
the platform of H3, and that it ultimately needed its own space to blossom. This was a discussion that needed

03:48:26.600 --> 03:48:32.600
to be had openly and honestly, instead it came down to one number. That number wasn't important as a singular statistic,

03:48:32.600 --> 03:48:37.600
but more for what it meant to Trisha, the fact that there would always be that difference between them,

03:48:37.600 --> 03:48:42.600
that neither party was completely ready to trust the other, neither quite possessed that faith.

03:48:51.600 --> 03:49:05.600
This is a serious message to everybody watching my update right now, peace and love, peace and love.

03:49:05.600 --> 03:49:11.600
Again, with peace and love, and I mean this with peace and love, peace and love, peace and love, peace and love,

03:49:11.600 --> 03:49:15.600
can you um, can you soundbite, I'm warning you with peace and love?

03:49:15.600 --> 03:49:19.600
Peace and love, it's a phrase you heard a lot on the H3 Podcast and Frenemies.

03:49:19.600 --> 03:49:23.600
It was first said by Ringo Starr, but quickly garnered meme status on the H3 Podcast.

03:49:23.600 --> 03:49:27.600
At first it merely held meme status, but eventually it evolved into something greater.

03:49:27.600 --> 03:49:30.600
Just don't eat the crust, why are you hating on the end?

03:49:30.600 --> 03:49:35.600
Mmm, I think it's a way to keep skinny, Dolly Parton once said she only eats the first bite and not the last bite.

03:49:35.600 --> 03:49:37.600
With peace and love it's not working.

03:49:37.600 --> 03:49:44.600
I have lost three pounds this week, thank you very much, and guess what, I just ate the last bite.

03:49:45.600 --> 03:49:49.600
With peace and love it's not working for you either, whatever you're doing, and you're working out.

03:49:49.600 --> 03:49:51.600
I'm not even working out, and I'm skinnier than you.

03:49:51.600 --> 03:49:55.600
Listen, I'm not calling you fat, I'm just saying.

03:49:55.600 --> 03:50:02.600
Over time peace and love became a way to contextualise or mitigate a possible disparaging remark or negative statement in good faith.

03:50:02.600 --> 03:50:08.600
Although not a method I would typically employ, I understand that some, especially Trisha, may have found that reassuring.

03:50:08.600 --> 03:50:13.600
The problem is that eventually it begins to tire as a technique, particularly when sometimes it feels difficult to fully present something

03:50:13.600 --> 03:50:16.600
as coming from a place of peace and love.

03:50:16.600 --> 03:50:26.600
And so I say with peace and love that, you know, as a friend I have come to love and appreciate Trisha.

03:50:26.600 --> 03:50:31.600
It's hard to do that when reflecting on her falling out publicly, and Trisha immediately uploading videos, tweets,

03:50:31.600 --> 03:50:35.600
and everything under the sun about how they felt placed everyone else on the back foot.

03:50:35.600 --> 03:50:39.600
Ethan was completely in his right to respond. Although it was a solid response in many ways,

03:50:39.600 --> 03:50:44.600
there was also a sense of vexation at the fact that he had tolerated so much of Trisha's behaviour this time round,

03:50:44.600 --> 03:50:46.600
and yet still ended up in the same position.

03:50:46.600 --> 03:50:52.600
The problem is that when you have that building up, your narrative begins to spiral into that cynical perception of a person's actions.

03:50:52.600 --> 03:50:55.600
Take the issue of Trisha wanting to fire the crew.

03:50:55.600 --> 03:51:02.600
Is that I was talking to the crew like, Trisha wants to, I was like, listen, Trisha wants to hire a new crew.

03:51:02.600 --> 03:51:08.600
Now as noted, Trisha did not say this directly, but I can understand why you'd seem to think that they are implying it.

03:51:08.600 --> 03:51:13.600
Ethan admits he handled this situation incorrectly by paraphrasing Trisha's comments to the crew.

03:51:13.600 --> 03:51:18.600
Javi doesn't actually walk back the notion of Trisha wanting to fire the crew, in fact continuing to mention it throughout the video,

03:51:18.600 --> 03:51:22.600
even stating that Trisha had directly said they wanted to fire the crew.

03:51:22.600 --> 03:51:31.600
If anyone was upset, it's because she said that she wanted to fire everybody and get a new staff that made people uncomfortable.

03:51:31.600 --> 03:51:36.600
The reason they were upset that I misunderstood is because she said she wanted to fire them all.

03:51:36.600 --> 03:51:43.600
Now Ethan is completely entitled to his interpretation of Trisha's comments, and Trisha hadn't done themselves any favours in the previous days,

03:51:43.600 --> 03:51:46.600
but once again, it exuded a lack of faith in Trisha's intent.

03:51:46.600 --> 03:51:51.600
Although Trisha had been unnecessarily rude about the crew, they hadn't explicitly stated that they wanted them fired,

03:51:51.600 --> 03:51:58.600
and continuing to assert this interpretation cements your stance that you believe that their expression of these feelings didn't come from a genuine place.

03:51:58.600 --> 03:52:03.600
Some may say, well he only has this interpretation because of how Trisha had been in the previous days,

03:52:03.600 --> 03:52:07.600
but he asserts that this was his understanding before Frenemies had disbanded.

03:52:07.600 --> 03:52:12.600
The wording of firing is also going to be quite evocative, because it often implies that people are going to be losing their jobs,

03:52:12.600 --> 03:52:19.600
however in this case, as Ethan notes himself, these are people who work other jobs for the podcast, and therefore it was unlikely that this would be the case.

03:52:19.600 --> 03:52:26.600
How did you hire Sam without consulting me? It's like, I'm sorry, this is our business, she's not just working on Frenemies.

03:52:26.600 --> 03:52:30.600
Why do I need to consult you who I hire for my business?

03:52:30.600 --> 03:52:37.600
I don't think his point is completely invalid, but I think it conveys a restrained bitterness that was never spoken about while the podcast felt redeemable,

03:52:37.600 --> 03:52:43.600
which then skews the perspective of that specific case, and obviously causes more subsequent anger from Trisha in their responses.

03:52:43.600 --> 03:52:45.600
He's bringing up running the whole crew list again.

03:52:45.600 --> 03:52:47.600
We fronted the money, we-

03:52:47.600 --> 03:52:50.600
In what world? You have all these receipts, show the fucking receipts Ethan.

03:52:50.600 --> 03:52:55.600
Now, I think its presentation is clearly clouded by Ethan's own feelings about the situation,

03:52:55.600 --> 03:52:59.600
but I do think it does represent that sort of thing that a peace and love tone cannot offset,

03:52:59.600 --> 03:53:04.600
and although I think he had decent grounds to believe that Trisha may have been hinting at hiring a new crew for the podcast,

03:53:04.600 --> 03:53:09.600
I think his representation just showed he hadn't progressed his opinion of Trisha as much as the viewers thought he had.

03:53:09.600 --> 03:53:11.600
It was clear that he still harbored great doubts.

03:53:11.600 --> 03:53:17.600
Trisha was no different either, even though they opened their video expressing love for Ethan that soon disappeared.

03:53:17.600 --> 03:53:22.600
It's interesting he'll show all the DMs except the ones where I say fire the crew or what he said to me the night of things that happened,

03:53:22.600 --> 03:53:24.600
in the order it happened.

03:53:24.600 --> 03:53:29.600
Trisha's video is not the easiest to follow because it's Trisha, but even amongst the numerous anecdotes they can fire off,

03:53:29.600 --> 03:53:33.600
you can tell that these are evident problems, and they've been evident problems for the longest time.

03:53:33.600 --> 03:53:36.600
The whole leaving frenemies situation in itself was a good example,

03:53:36.600 --> 03:53:41.600
but in all honesty, if you just watch back the episodes, there are so many moments where they clearly express hesitancy

03:53:41.600 --> 03:53:47.600
to accept support or the peace and love vibe, likely because they weren't entirely happy with the podcast as it was.

03:53:47.600 --> 03:54:14.600
As noted, I personally find it difficult to write off the idea that Trisha's departure was actually a stunt,

03:54:14.600 --> 03:54:18.600
intended to result in further negotiations for an issue they viewed as present,

03:54:18.600 --> 03:54:24.600
but if anything, they proved that they didn't believe that being honest with Ethan would actually bring about the desired result.

03:54:24.600 --> 03:54:30.600
Instead of patiently talking it out, they believed they had to generate negative attention because they believed that was what Ethan would respond to.

03:54:30.600 --> 03:54:36.600
They didn't trust Ethan, Ethan didn't trust Trisha, and they both clearly had issues but didn't have that open discussion

03:54:36.600 --> 03:54:39.600
because they thought holding it back would prevent more harm.

03:54:40.600 --> 03:55:03.600
In actuality, this only yields further frustration because then the other person has to consider the fact that you never really trusted them as a friend

03:55:03.600 --> 03:55:07.600
and that they were just tolerating your presence for the maintenance of a business partnership.

03:55:08.600 --> 03:55:13.600
Trisha was the worst person to experience that because they often seemed to seek justification for why people hated them,

03:55:13.600 --> 03:55:16.600
which inevitably implanted the narrative that they were only used for views.

03:55:16.600 --> 03:55:20.600
This then spirals and only furthers the bad faith interpretations they have of each other,

03:55:20.600 --> 03:55:27.600
and in the remainder of 2021 we saw attempts from both sides to really twist the knife in because they believed it was the only justified response

03:55:27.600 --> 03:55:31.600
when the other willfully tried to hurt them, far from that peace and love we'd seen before.

03:55:32.600 --> 03:55:36.600
A 40's hour philosophy can only work as much as it's what a person positively responds to,

03:55:36.600 --> 03:55:42.600
and to be honest, sometimes I think Trisha needed more than peace and love, or at least they required a tougher version of it.

03:55:42.600 --> 03:55:49.600
It often represented the eggshells that Ethan felt like he walked on, something that Trisha specifically said they didn't want in messages and later videos.

03:55:49.600 --> 03:55:55.600
However, if it wasn't what they wanted, why did they support it when it was first mentioned by the expert himself?

03:56:01.600 --> 03:56:30.600
Trisha and Ethan really needed, with some private sessions, to talk about what frustrated them with a paid professional to make sure these problems didn't fall over,

03:56:30.600 --> 03:56:33.600
and instead, what they received was this,

03:56:39.600 --> 03:56:41.600
and the podcast suffered for it.

03:56:42.600 --> 03:56:46.600
There's one video that I've refrained from talking about yet, because it may just be the worst of them all.

03:56:46.600 --> 03:56:51.600
During the era where Trisha was attempting to talk about frenemies without doing it on their own channel,

03:56:51.600 --> 03:56:53.600
they went onto a podcast with many people.

03:56:53.600 --> 03:56:58.600
One of these people, though, was Dr. Drew, the former mediating party of previous therapy episodes.

03:56:58.600 --> 03:57:04.600
In this video, when discussing the demise of frenemies, Drew continues to repeat previous narratives that he had imparted so helpfully

03:57:04.600 --> 03:57:10.600
during his appearances on the defunct podcast in question, just with more confidence now that the two had actually parted.

03:57:10.600 --> 03:57:16.600
It's really strange watching the man who was meant to help resolve it almost play into it, and the questionable narratives at hand.

03:57:16.600 --> 03:57:22.600
In a way, I don't think Dr. Drew's core advice is of no use, but the problem is that he takes a lot of what Trisha says at face value,

03:57:22.600 --> 03:57:25.600
and that ultimately nullifies a lot of his conclusions.

03:57:25.600 --> 03:57:30.600
I was repeating them to him to help him understand them, and trying to frame his response to them,

03:57:30.600 --> 03:57:38.600
because he's not the one struggling, although he's in the thing with you, he was evoked by what was going on with you.

03:57:38.600 --> 03:57:43.600
I've already delivered a fair few criticisms of Dr. Drew, but I think with the full context of the face of the podcast,

03:57:43.600 --> 03:57:50.600
we can now see the ramifications of clumsily handled relationship advice by fully understanding the actual problems that Trisha and Ethan seem to perceive.

03:57:51.600 --> 03:57:58.600
The truth is that I'm very grateful for the experience we've had with Frenemies, and all the learning and growing and developing,

03:57:58.600 --> 03:58:02.600
and the amazing growth that our channel has seen as the result of that show.

03:58:02.600 --> 03:58:08.600
I mean, it's been popular and successful beyond what either of us anticipated.

03:58:08.600 --> 03:58:15.600
Trisha wanted to transform the podcast, both they and Kline acknowledged its astounding success and view count in comparison to similar series on the channel.

03:58:15.600 --> 03:58:20.600
Frenemies clearly had a presence in an audience of its own, and Trisha's interpretation to me seemed almost like a child,

03:58:20.600 --> 03:58:25.600
wondering how long they would have to behave before Kline entrusted more responsibility onto them,

03:58:25.600 --> 03:58:29.600
but Kline didn't want to move on that because he didn't want to rely on someone who may not stick around.

03:58:29.600 --> 03:58:32.600
Why is that? Well, Ethan still didn't trust Trisha enough.

03:58:32.600 --> 03:58:37.600
Ethan couldn't predict what Trisha would do and wasn't prepared to put that faith in his own judgement alone,

03:58:37.600 --> 03:58:41.600
and that was something that should have been at least worked on during the two pivotal episodes with Dr. Drew.

03:58:41.600 --> 03:58:47.600
In a perfect world, counselling would enable both parties to find closure, yet acceptance in the differences they hold.

03:58:47.600 --> 03:58:53.600
This doesn't always happen, and for two people as diametrically opposed as Ethan and Trisha, maybe that could never happen.

03:58:53.600 --> 03:58:56.600
However, the insight they received was probably the least helpful it could be.

03:58:56.600 --> 03:59:01.600
It created this normal where problems were swept under the rug in the hope that ultimately the strength of the podcast would prevail,

03:59:01.600 --> 03:59:05.600
but tensions boil over, and bottling up problems will eventually break bonds down.

03:59:05.600 --> 03:59:08.600
There were eggshells that everyone was walking on, too afraid to address them.

03:59:09.600 --> 03:59:12.600
From the beginning, we've always been combative, as opposed to you.

03:59:12.600 --> 03:59:17.600
I know you're always team Trish, as opposed to, again, it's fine, but I know it was to exploit me, right?

03:59:17.600 --> 03:59:21.600
He wanted me to walk off that set that day, so my attitude's different, which is fine.

03:59:21.600 --> 03:59:26.600
I exploit myself, like I said, that's my one entertaining quality for the internet, so I was like, fine, that's fine.

03:59:26.600 --> 03:59:31.600
But it's like, I knew that going into it that he was always trying to do another walk off, you know what I mean?

03:59:31.600 --> 03:59:33.600
So it's a little different as opposed to you.

03:59:33.600 --> 03:59:38.600
In many ways, it told Ethan to essentially seek appeasement for the sake of the podcast's longevity.

03:59:38.600 --> 03:59:43.600
Repression isn't resolution, though, and if you have these apprehensions that persist, you should talk about them,

03:59:43.600 --> 03:59:46.600
even if Trisha may find it upsetting or offensive in the moment.

03:59:46.600 --> 03:59:51.600
In this case, longevity itself is still temporary because eventually these things break down,

03:59:51.600 --> 03:59:57.600
because eventually you lose your patience or the other person picks up on the fact that you're still unsure of where you stand with them,

03:59:57.600 --> 04:00:01.600
and begins to unravel themselves in an attempt to change that, that rollover mentality.

04:00:01.600 --> 04:00:07.600
It showed itself as demonstrably detrimental when Trisha was trying to assert those worst expectations in that final episode,

04:00:07.600 --> 04:00:11.600
because Ethan just went ahead and confirmed it to try and end the argument, to try and move on,

04:00:11.600 --> 04:00:16.600
but sometimes people don't move on until they've cleared something up, until they've repaired that trust.

04:00:16.600 --> 04:00:23.600
Thank you for giving me a third wave. I feel like I've gone through, Shane gave me the first wave, then David, then, oh, we're not falling out.

04:00:23.600 --> 04:00:27.600
Well, we almost did, but we pulled through.

04:00:27.600 --> 04:00:30.600
You're marrying my brother-in-law, so.

04:00:30.600 --> 04:00:31.600
It's like we're stuck.

04:00:31.600 --> 04:00:33.600
Kind of removing the options.

04:00:33.600 --> 04:00:35.600
You haven't f'd your cat or anything.

04:00:35.600 --> 04:00:40.600
I'm not the kind of dude who, like, holds grudges. I like to sell squash beef, especially with people like in my family.

04:00:40.600 --> 04:00:44.600
Trust starts with transparency. Understanding boundaries is an important building block to that.

04:00:44.600 --> 04:00:50.600
Trisha is wildly inconsistent, and hell, it may have been a lost cause to even try and understand what lines they would hypothetically draw,

04:00:50.600 --> 04:00:56.600
but it would have been better than doing nothing at all. At the worst, it would have allowed the podcast to end on a note of mutual agreement,

04:00:56.600 --> 04:01:03.600
something that proved impossible in the current environment, and was only illuminated by their conflicting interpretations of the unaired episode

04:01:03.600 --> 04:01:07.600
where they attempted to settle those. But it wasn't just about Trisha's boundaries.

04:01:07.600 --> 04:01:11.600
I think every single person, every group I've been with, Shane Dawson, David Dobrik, Ethan and his crew,

04:01:11.600 --> 04:01:17.600
like, they're all these guys that are like, oh my god, Trisha's so crazy. Like, what the fuck? She says this crazy stuff, her crazy life.

04:01:17.600 --> 04:01:23.600
Like, candlesticks up her ass, all this stuff. And then as soon as, like, I get triggered by it, it's like, oh, too much.

04:01:23.600 --> 04:01:28.600
Oh, like, she's just a bad person. She uses, like, mental health. It's like, all of a sudden, it's like, you know, it's like, if it's too much,

04:01:28.600 --> 04:01:30.600
they're like, disengage, disengage. It's weird. I don't know.

04:01:30.600 --> 04:01:36.600
There are no two ways about it. The infamous December episode where Trisha loses their temper at Ethan and the absent Eli

04:01:36.600 --> 04:01:42.600
was unacceptable behaviour for anyone, and although their conduct never approached that specific degree of volatility again,

04:01:42.600 --> 04:01:46.600
it should have been outlined that they wouldn't receive the same treatment if that happened next time.

04:01:46.600 --> 04:01:51.600
I think Trisha almost believed their loyalty to the podcast was assumed because drama was naturally inbuilt.

04:01:51.600 --> 04:01:58.600
They repeat this on the Dr Drew podcast, but they continue to focus on that one event, the storming out, and not actually what followed.

04:01:58.600 --> 04:02:03.600
I'm good about this. Okay, let's go through your stupid, I don't like this segment, just for the record, fan advice is a stupid segment.

04:02:04.600 --> 04:02:09.600
I don't think Ethan's greatest issue with Trisha was their on-podcast behaviour in the final episode.

04:02:09.600 --> 04:02:15.600
I think what more pushed him towards the conclusion that the partnership was beyond saving was the DMs that Trisha leaked themselves,

04:02:15.600 --> 04:02:20.600
where they once more lose their cool, and Trisha announcing that they were leaving. However, this probably wouldn't have happened

04:02:20.600 --> 04:02:26.600
if Trisha knew it wasn't going to work. In a couple of other notable instances, Trisha's explosive behaviour had been rewarded

04:02:26.600 --> 04:02:30.600
with a seat at the negotiation table, with a therapist by their side. That didn't happen.

04:02:30.600 --> 04:02:35.600
From my perspective, Ethan felt like he'd done everything to keep Trisha happy, and it still wasn't enough,

04:02:35.600 --> 04:02:40.600
and at that point he decided that there was nothing else he could do, and concluded that accepting Trisha's resignation from the podcast

04:02:40.600 --> 04:02:46.600
was the smartest route. This wasn't the first time that Trisha had said they were quitting, but it was the first time that Ethan rubber-stamped it.

04:02:46.600 --> 04:02:51.600
If there had been an established method in problem resolution beyond just pushing it towards the backburner,

04:02:51.600 --> 04:02:56.600
Trisha may never have considered leaving the podcast as an acceptable course to having their qualms recognised.

04:02:56.600 --> 04:03:01.600
They needed a system for these problems that was mutually acknowledged that if breached, would bring about the show's termination.

04:03:01.600 --> 04:03:07.600
If Trisha did have some form of rationale to their behaviour, then this would at least serve as greater motivation to not act in a way

04:03:07.600 --> 04:03:09.600
that they did after the show's downfall.

04:03:09.600 --> 04:03:32.600
It's very easy to point fingers at people directly involved in the drama, and to be honest, I think there is some responsibility that can be attributed there,

04:03:32.600 --> 04:03:37.600
but I also think that sometimes you need the right guidance, and in this case that could only be provided by a professional therapist

04:03:38.600 --> 04:03:42.600
who didn't have any biases, any priorities, or a public personality to maintain.

04:03:42.600 --> 04:03:47.600
If you put the survival of a podcast above the survival of your friendship, and the openness that you can express in it,

04:03:47.600 --> 04:03:53.600
then the podcast will suffer nonetheless. It is built from that friendship, or frenemyship, not vice versa.

04:03:54.600 --> 04:04:14.600
As much as we can assign blame to subpar vice, it was also Ethan and Trisha's decision to bring Dr Drew on and abide by his wisdom.

04:04:14.600 --> 04:04:19.600
If anything, the presence of a personality like Dr Drew showed that although the drama was personal,

04:04:19.600 --> 04:04:23.600
frenemys were still just a spectacle, and it needed to be more than that to survive.

04:04:34.600 --> 04:04:41.600
When Ethan started the H3 Podcast channel, I think he hoped that it would allow him to present a more unfiltered, authentic version of himself,

04:04:41.600 --> 04:04:45.600
and in a way, he achieved that. However, he also experienced issues expressing that natural self,

04:04:45.600 --> 04:04:50.600
and working it into conversations with other guests, and often getting into drama himself.

04:04:50.600 --> 04:04:55.600
Drama and conflict aside, there was definitely a need to surround himself with people who would play off his best parts,

04:04:55.600 --> 04:05:02.600
and ameliorate his worst. Nowadays he does that pretty successfully with his crew, but back then Trisha was the catalyst to bring H3 into a new era.

04:05:07.600 --> 04:05:12.600
Who would have guessed that a few select comments could spawn such a tumultuous and memorable partnership in the YouTube history books,

04:05:12.600 --> 04:05:16.600
and in many ways they did create something timeless, an experience that many were grateful for.

04:05:16.600 --> 04:05:21.600
Given their characters at the start of the podcast, people really didn't believe it would last more than a few episodes,

04:05:21.600 --> 04:05:25.600
but over time that expectation changed, and the investment manifested as well.

04:05:25.600 --> 04:05:30.600
And for much of the time, the show appeared to undergo an evolution that transformed both Ethan and Trisha,

04:05:30.600 --> 04:05:34.600
moving from a dynamic of tense rivalry to strong camaraderie.

04:05:34.600 --> 04:05:38.600
With that in mind, there was a potential sadness that the podcast couldn't be something greater,

04:05:38.600 --> 04:05:41.600
as it seemed to be progressing in that direction for so long.

04:05:41.600 --> 04:05:47.600
I keep saying I love this show, and everyone just stopped the podcast, I'm like please don't stop this podcast, that's all I got going for.

04:05:47.600 --> 04:05:49.600
Well let me read you what they said.

04:05:49.600 --> 04:05:52.600
Without context, the episodes constructed a poignant story,

04:05:52.600 --> 04:05:57.600
one where Trisha had experienced so much maltreatment and desertion that their own responses were a product of their reception.

04:05:57.600 --> 04:06:02.600
In some ways it seemed like a believable account, particularly given the cannibalistic nature of internet culture,

04:06:02.600 --> 04:06:05.600
and the conviction that Trisha spoke with made it all the more convincing.

04:06:06.600 --> 04:06:12.600
It was an occasionally difficult but very sympathetic portrait of a person who was often judged quite harshly by the internet.

04:06:12.600 --> 04:06:17.600
Additionally, it was a sobering moment for a lot of viewers, and maybe prompted a fair bit of reflection on their behalf.

04:06:17.600 --> 04:06:20.600
However, often the problem with the internet is that it's a pendulum,

04:06:20.600 --> 04:06:23.600
it judges it individually either far too harshly or not at all,

04:06:23.600 --> 04:06:27.600
and in the deluge of sentimentality, some left their better judgement at the door.

04:06:27.600 --> 04:06:31.600
So many were sold on it, and maybe if some had detached themselves a little more,

04:06:31.600 --> 04:06:34.600
they would have picked up on certain lies designed to play up this story.

04:06:34.600 --> 04:06:38.600
I don't think this means that Trisha hasn't suffered in their life, I want to make that clear,

04:06:38.600 --> 04:06:43.600
but I do think they were too committed to it, too committed to a vision in their head that wasn't going to happen.

04:06:43.600 --> 04:06:50.600
Trisha is a person whose words have often held very little impact online because of how notably unreliable and melodramatic they are,

04:06:50.600 --> 04:06:54.600
but Frenemies changed the game for them due to the assumed realism of that podcast environment.

04:06:54.600 --> 04:06:58.600
Unfortunately, although it was in a new format, it was the same old Trish,

04:06:58.600 --> 04:07:01.600
and given they had proven to have lied a fair few times prior,

04:07:01.600 --> 04:07:07.600
including during their debut appearance on the H3 podcast, it was almost impressive they managed to rope people in once more.

04:07:07.600 --> 04:07:14.600
I think in this story, Ethan saw himself in a position where he could be the start of a healthier online relationship for Trisha.

04:07:14.600 --> 04:07:19.600
He really did try to make that difference in their life, but they weren't quite ready to let Ethan in,

04:07:19.600 --> 04:07:24.600
and I think Ethan picked up on that because Trisha knew that the podcast wasn't quite where they wanted it to be.

04:07:24.600 --> 04:07:27.600
Trisha had greater plans for this story, and Ethan didn't.

04:07:27.600 --> 04:07:33.600
I think deep down they both apprehended its collapse, either due to Trisha's own nature or Ethan's response to it,

04:07:33.600 --> 04:07:38.600
and in a way, Ethan's subsequent reaction to Trisha's lashing out helped preserve the abandonment narrative in their mind.

04:07:38.600 --> 04:07:43.600
I think every single person, every group I've been with, Shane Dawson, David Dobrik, Ethan and his crew,

04:07:43.600 --> 04:07:49.600
they're all these guys that are like, oh my gosh, you're just so crazy, what the fuck, she says this crazy stuff, her crazy life,

04:07:49.600 --> 04:07:54.600
like candlesticks up her ass, all this stuff, and then as soon as I get triggered by it, it's like, oh, too much,

04:07:54.600 --> 04:07:59.600
oh, she's just a bad person, she's just mental, it's like, all of a sudden, it's like, you know, if it's too much,

04:07:59.600 --> 04:08:02.600
they're like, disengage, disengage, it's weird, I don't know.

04:08:02.600 --> 04:08:03.600
Right, yeah.

04:08:03.600 --> 04:08:04.600
Then they abandoned it.

04:08:04.600 --> 04:08:05.600
Yeah, exactly.

04:08:05.600 --> 04:08:08.600
The difference is, at that stage, it was Trisha who left the podcast.

04:08:08.600 --> 04:08:14.600
It wasn't Ethan's fault. The one thing that I would say Ethan was unequivocally right to do, though, was to accept the end of the podcast.

04:08:14.600 --> 04:08:20.600
I have my problems with Ethan's reaction and response, I think I've made that clear, and I don't know the exact reasons behind his decision,

04:08:20.600 --> 04:08:24.600
but he couldn't have maintained it in good faith with the then-present arrangements.

04:08:24.600 --> 04:08:28.600
It was the best thing to do, not just for him, but for Trisha as well, and everyone around them,

04:08:28.600 --> 04:08:31.600
and honestly could have helped preserve a good friendship.

04:08:31.600 --> 04:08:34.600
To do so much in public, on one hand, can be raw and powerful.

04:08:34.600 --> 04:08:39.600
On the other hand, it blurs the line between persona and person, and Trisha is so bad with that.

04:08:39.600 --> 04:08:43.600
I know I've probably said that before, but it doesn't become any less true,

04:08:43.600 --> 04:08:46.600
and as the personal relationships become more and more intertwined,

04:08:46.600 --> 04:08:52.600
it was clear that these moments of conflict were only going to cause more harm to Trisha, Ethan, crew, friends, and family.

04:08:52.600 --> 04:08:57.600
At the start, I noted that a podcast sometimes could only run as long as there is a motivation,

04:08:57.600 --> 04:09:02.600
but in the case of Frenemies, the motivation to start the podcast was ultimately the motivation taken to end it,

04:09:02.600 --> 04:09:08.600
because what initially benefited them became a detriment as they grew closer, that friendship.

04:09:08.600 --> 04:09:11.600
Unfortunately, that friendship couldn't be saved because of what followed.

04:09:11.600 --> 04:09:14.600
Trisha's phase distinguished between that public and private aspect of Frenemies,

04:09:14.600 --> 04:09:17.600
and Ethan being pushed past breaking point when reflecting on it.

04:09:17.600 --> 04:09:20.600
If you had a time machine, you could probably change a few things,

04:09:20.600 --> 04:09:25.600
and maybe it would have kept the podcast alive a little longer, but maybe it would have imploded even sooner.

04:09:25.600 --> 04:09:29.600
Who knows, I think the one element that may have been worth saving was the friendship itself,

04:09:29.600 --> 04:09:33.600
removing that betrayal and reflecting on the intent of the parties on that podcast,

04:09:33.600 --> 04:09:37.600
and with the family involved, maybe it would have been a more peaceful conclusion for all.

04:09:37.600 --> 04:09:41.600
Instead we had one which dragged in other parties, over-invested fans to an extreme degree,

04:09:41.600 --> 04:09:45.600
and always ended up exhausting everyone actually involved because they couldn't say anything final.

04:09:45.600 --> 04:09:50.600
As much as it's entertaining for audience members and possibly cathartic for yourself to go mask off in a stream,

04:09:50.600 --> 04:09:55.600
Stalemate is never satisfying, and when you pit yourself against each other in such a way that's all you're ever going to end up with.

04:09:55.600 --> 04:09:58.600
As we've seen, if you wrong Ethan, he's often not afraid to hold back.

04:09:58.600 --> 04:10:00.600
That's for better and for worse with him,

04:10:00.600 --> 04:10:04.600
particularly when he wants to rip into someone the way he would occasionally advise against.

04:10:04.600 --> 04:10:06.600
We're pretty PC in general, too.

04:10:06.600 --> 04:10:14.600
Like it's a comedy podcast, but I feel like we're pretty respectful at the same time.

04:10:14.600 --> 04:10:19.600
Um, so, I don't know. I think some of y'all are just too sensitive.

04:10:19.600 --> 04:10:21.600
You're not a politician.

04:10:21.600 --> 04:10:23.600
Yeah, exactly, and thank God for that.

04:10:23.600 --> 04:10:25.600
Thank you, by the way, for defending me.

04:10:27.600 --> 04:10:32.600
I feel like, you know, if you're watching this show and you're perpetually offended by things I'm saying,

04:10:32.600 --> 04:10:35.600
you may want to just stop watching, like genuinely.

04:10:35.600 --> 04:10:38.600
And I'm trying my best to learn when I can,

04:10:38.600 --> 04:10:44.600
and I did take and learn what I could from Matt, and I listened respectfully.

04:10:45.600 --> 04:10:51.600
But, um, to say it's gross and disappointing, which is a comment I'm reading specifically,

04:10:51.600 --> 04:10:59.600
uh, is just, I think you're too sensitive for the show. I really do. I'm sorry.

04:10:59.600 --> 04:11:03.600
Ethan is a regularly cynical guy who tries to be socially conscious, but often fails,

04:11:03.600 --> 04:11:06.600
and will draw criticism for supposed pandering and double standards due to it.

04:11:06.600 --> 04:11:11.600
Trisha and their loyal fans clearly possess this impression that Ethan still only cared about the podcast for its content,

04:11:11.600 --> 04:11:15.600
and not for them, and maybe at the start when some people raised that concern it was a valid point,

04:11:15.600 --> 04:11:20.600
but over time I do think Ethan's intentions evolved, which I think is what made him so bitter at the end.

04:11:20.600 --> 04:11:23.600
I think he did care, and I think he was embarrassed at himself for caring.

04:11:23.600 --> 04:11:27.600
You see me as a troll and a trickster and nothing's true.

04:11:27.600 --> 04:11:30.600
You see me as that way because you see through your own lens.

04:11:30.600 --> 04:11:35.600
You yourself are only seeing your own kind of shadow being cast on the world.

04:11:35.600 --> 04:11:36.600
That's not true, I don't...

04:11:36.600 --> 04:11:37.600
Trisha has a problem with the public sphere.

04:11:37.600 --> 04:11:43.600
As acknowledged early on, there's evidently an issue with the fact that they don't value the consequences their words can hold,

04:11:43.600 --> 04:11:46.600
and the implications they may have in a socially sensitive environment.

04:11:46.600 --> 04:11:49.600
Even if the comments didn't directly affect the people that were being referred to,

04:11:49.600 --> 04:11:54.600
there were others in those circles, and even on the podcast, that did feel that impact.

04:11:54.600 --> 04:11:59.600
Whether Trisha cared too much about themselves or not enough about others is judgement I'll leave down to you,

04:11:59.600 --> 04:12:04.600
but whatever the reason, it ultimately wasn't one made for a podcast, or the podcast.

04:12:04.600 --> 04:12:09.600
I know some will probably be disappointed that I didn't comment on Trisha's personal life more,

04:12:09.600 --> 04:12:13.600
particularly their contentious marriage to Moses, but simply put, I don't know enough about it.

04:12:13.600 --> 04:12:18.600
All I'll say is that I think Trisha needs people around them who don't condone their behaviour just because it's Trisha.

04:12:18.600 --> 04:12:24.600
Give Trisha a reason to be better. Trisha can get better, it's just a shame that that wasn't the result of the podcast.

04:12:24.600 --> 04:12:30.600
It was a project that yielded so much for Ethan and Trisha, but also left the feeling that there could have been so much more,

04:12:30.600 --> 04:12:36.600
and it had long overreaching personal implications, leaving some questioning whether it was ever worth it.

04:12:36.600 --> 04:12:42.600
For what it is worth though, one thing I've learned from reading too many comments was that even if it wasn't quite what it appeared to be,

04:12:42.600 --> 04:12:45.600
Frenemies was still a moment of divine escapism for many.

04:12:45.600 --> 04:12:50.600
Those who came home on a Monday night, tired and daunted by the week ahead, had something to look forward to.

04:12:50.600 --> 04:12:58.600
Two of YouTube's most recognisable and polarising figures providing their informed and occasionally uninformed takes on YouTube drama.

04:12:59.600 --> 04:13:07.600
Frenemies was chaotic, problematic, and deeply flawed, but it was also a compelling story that many followed closely and wanted that fairytale ending from.

04:13:07.600 --> 04:13:12.600
Sometimes fiction is more fanciful than reality, and this was one of those times.

04:13:12.600 --> 04:13:19.600
Yet, even if its legacy has been tainted, in many people's hearts, Trisha and Ethan will always be Frenemies.
