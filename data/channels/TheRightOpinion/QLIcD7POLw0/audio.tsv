0	8360	Cut the head in half have your halves cut these pieces into smaller pieces
30000	47000	Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the right minion, haha, the home of an epic gamer with too much free time.
47000	55000	I'm running on like 4 hours of sleep and my life is misery, how are you today? That was a rhetorical question, you can't answer it because this is pre-recorded,
55000	58000	though obviously you can comment it so I wasn't thinking that far ahead.
58000	65000	Some of you may be asking, but Trove, James, my mate, why is your life misery? Well a multitude of reasons,
65000	72000	but I tell you recently, all this drama has had my brain fried, so much going on in the world that I need to catch up on,
72000	80000	which honestly, with all my other commitments, does not electrify me with enthusiasm. It drove me insane to the point where I decided to relax by playing a video game,
80000	85000	but in the end I just stayed up until 8am, letting my sanity further deteriorates.
85000	92000	Though I did complete the game, so you know what? I thought, who needs trending topics anyway? How about we do something a bit more out of left field,
92000	100000	a bit more fun? Hey, I like fun, that's the sort of thing that gets me up in the morning on top of my parents' crippling expectations.
100000	108000	Haha, now many of you may be wondering why I'm in such a hilarious mood today, well it's because we're going to the ever hilarious genre of pranksters.
108000	117000	Pranksters are a legendary genre on YouTube, if you are not at least familiar with one prankster out of the countless controversies that they have brought us,
117000	124000	then you're either not looking hard enough, or you might even have a life. But either way, they reigned supreme for a few years throughout the mid 2010s,
124000	132000	and there are many still going to this day. The thing is that although the golden era may be long behind us, those pranksters still made a lot of money,
132000	140000	and we're not talking about loose change here, some of the most viewed videos have over 100 million views. It was repulsive in a way, but that's what people wanted.
140000	147000	Now being a YouTuber isn't just about creating videos, for some of us it is, because we get turned off by all the additional business work,
147000	156000	I know it's always a gruel for me, but when you're a prankster, there is a very fine craft. You see, although these videos may get you millions on top of millions,
156000	163000	and in some instances even billions of views while you're making it big in the game, there is basically no longevity.
163000	170000	Eventually, once you've milked every single idea dry, people will begin to see that there's nothing really to stick around for.
170000	178000	And on principle, this isn't inherently true, just because someone makes prank videos doesn't mean they suddenly have an inability to make videos in other genres,
178000	187000	I mean someone who did manage to sensationally transfer their skill set was Roman Atwood, a person who really did incredibly well considering how moronic much of his content was.
187000	195000	However, that's the thing, prank videos didn't blow off the real connection between the audience and the prankster, the closest you might have got was FusiTube maybe,
195000	202000	but that's only because he loaded his content with ham-fisted social messages that won over audiences with fairly low bars of expectation.
202000	210000	Most other pranksters either became extremely infamous very quickly and then quickly lost it, or were mostly invisible behind their inane pranks.
210000	214000	This is likely because some of them don't really have much going for them otherwise.
214000	222000	Make no mistake, I almost do have a grudging respect for how much they put themselves through to turn out content for the sake of views,
222000	228000	you need to have an incredible amount of drive to do that. But that's all it is a lot of the time, drive,
228000	232000	and the ability to pick out the most provocative topics that will interest people.
232000	236000	One of the people who certainly embodies this idea is Joey Salads.
236000	241000	Joey Salads, or Joey Saladino, is one of the more politically charged pranksters.
241000	246000	His pranks, or quote social experiments, have caused him controversy over time.
246000	251000	He's been on and off the grid for a while, you probably know him for his multiple run-ins with H3.
251000	256000	However, he is more than just a prankster, he is now a politician in waiting.
256000	262000	Now some of my friends interacted with Joey at last year's VidCon, which I was at, but I never got the chance to have a conversation.
262000	268000	But either way, they received the big Joey Salads follow, and since then, they have been keeping up with what he's doing,
268000	274000	and obviously this little stunt being one of the newest, most interesting developments to be going on in his life.
274000	280000	Also, for the record, I will again be at VidCon this year, July the 10th to the 13th, definitely recommend coming.
280000	285000	You see, as a prankster, as long as you didn't do anything too criminal, you should be able to rebrand.
285000	291000	But the problem is, although you may have made a fat stack of dollar, you're somewhat limited in your scope,
291000	295000	particularly when it was established that most pranks were completely fabricated.
295000	303000	With social experiments, that was an important revelation, because a lot of the points that could be drawn from those videos had genuine social repercussions.
303000	308000	Therefore, it made sense for a lot of pranksters to take three routes, either move into a different genre,
308000	318000	one not heavily reputation-based like Roman Atwood did with his family blogging, smile more, oh yeah be happy, be nice, do pranks in the hood,
318000	321000	actually scratch that part, I'll save that for another time.
321000	327000	The other option is to milk the pranks dry and run them into the ground, a perfect example of this would be someone like Prank Invasion,
327000	333000	who has recently taken to pranks that are basically incestuous and questionable in whether they're even pranks.
333000	342000	It basically boils down YouTube pranks to what they are, their core essence, clickbait, and all other considerations for what even qualifies as a prank can go out the window,
342000	347000	some people just like weird stuff and branding it under a prank makes them feel better about it.
347000	357000	The third option is just to carry on hustling but out of the public eye, maybe you'd go into some business, maybe you'll invest your money into Bitcoin and turn 2 million into 35,
357000	363000	buy a nice mansion in LA and settle down with a lovely lady or gentleman depending on who you are and what you like of course.
363000	366000	Or the fourth option of course, be FouseyTube.
376000	385000	However, one option that we don't see touched on is public service, in the internet age it's difficult to go from the public internet platform into politics,
385000	389000	because of all the history you leave on it, as shown by people like Sargon.
389000	396000	When you're online you have a mindset that many of the things you say and do are much less consequential than they might be in real life,
396000	401000	and they are to an extent, but at the same time you can still break it down to its individual conduct,
401000	406000	and when you go into politics one of the hard truths is that the media will completely be at your throats,
406000	413000	regardless of how virtuous you truly are, the media love drama and anything they can twist their way they will,
413000	419000	so it seems bonkers that a prankster would run for Congress, but that is what Joey Salads has chosen to do,
419000	421000	with his announcement coming in late April.
421000	427000	So what exactly is Joey doing? Does he have a chance? How might his past affect his campaign?
427000	433000	And should it affect his campaign? And will he receive an endorsement from the mighty right opinion?
433000	438000	These are all questions that I plan to answer over the process of the next half an hour to an ample degree.
438000	440000	I hope you'll accompany me for this journey.
444000	453000	So yeah, this is Joey Saladino. As said, many people probably know him for his pranks, but we'll be discussing them very soon.
453000	459000	Let's lay down the basic facts, let's have a look at his biography, and see if we can get to know him as a person,
459000	461000	because that's what matters isn't it?
461000	468000	Now looking at his bios, it's clear that either the authors of the pages have a deep adoration for our macho hero here,
468000	471000	or that he might just have had a hand in creating these bios.
471000	478000	Famous birthdays credit him as the video creating phenomenon on YouTube who is known for creating funny prank videos.
478000	480000	Such a great sentence.
480000	484000	And heightline are even more flattering, branding Joey as a household name,
484000	489000	known for uploading mind-blowing social media experiments and pranks.
489000	493000	So what is beyond the aggrandizing, and what do we actually know?
493000	499000	Well, Joey was born in Staten Island in the suburb of New York, I like how they had to clarify that makes him part of the US,
499000	501000	clearly they know Joey's demographic well.
501000	506000	He grew up, attended a Catholic school, he proceeded to college, he became a pizza delivery boy,
506000	510000	a fairly ordinary life of a guy from a New York borough.
510000	517000	However, Joseph had bigger dreams, and quickly transferred from pizza delivery boy to the humor delivery boy.
517000	520000	You see what they did there? Hey, life is suffering.
520000	527000	So basically Joey's catchphrase is, it's bashing time, which obviously calls back to the fact that he loves a good wank, I jest.
527000	534000	It's anti-relating to the fact that when he started, he used to bash various items as pranks, such as his sister's laptop,
534000	537000	his sister's door, his sister's computer.
537000	539000	Honestly, his sister had it pretty rough.
539000	542000	Please don't read into that comment, you sick, sick person.
542000	545000	I know what you're thinking, that's disgusting, shame on you.
545000	546000	That's not how I meant it.
546000	550000	Leave comments below on what I should bash next, and maybe I'll pick one.
550000	552000	This is the first content that he gained traction from.
552000	559000	There was information about a speech he did regarding the deterioration of social values allegedly going viral,
559000	561000	but I cannot find that, I wish I could.
561000	567000	He gradually moved towards more mainstream pranks, and obviously into the content that he became infamous for.
567000	571000	This content was rather typical of the prankster comedy around then.
571000	578000	Cheap clickbait, hijinks, huge reaction, not exactly what I'd brand as funny, but hey, comedy is subjective.
578000	583000	Now in defence of this article's rather slanted tone, it does highlight that Mr Saladino's YouTube career
583000	588000	has been ridden with pitfalls, particularly relating to some of his more distasteful pranks.
588000	592000	As noted here, the three that receive a bit more attention than the others,
592000	597000	though there's more to discuss later, are the Muslim vs Christian terror video,
597000	601000	the transgender person in women's bathroom, and the infamous trump car.
601000	604000	They're not just controversial because they're provocative topics,
604000	607000	they're controversial because they are actually terrible.
607000	611000	Let's start with the Muslim vs Christian one, which basically presents an imminent terror threat.
611000	614000	Now if we set aside the fact that this is almost certainly fake,
614000	619000	one of the biggest issues is that the Muslim is dressed in such stereotypically Arab clothing
619000	624000	that it falsely pushes a pretense that Islamic terrorism can be identified by a fashion choice.
624000	629000	It also doesn't help that the person acting as the Muslim ran in a much more aggressive fashion
629000	631000	and moved with much greater intent.
631000	636000	This video was actually removed at the start of 2019 for violating YouTube's terms of service.
636000	641000	Then you have the transgender person in women's bathroom, which is just incredibly uncomfortable to watch.
641000	645000	He spends the first minute and a half trying to validate this rather awful idea
645000	651000	by appealing to the authority of his quote transgender friend whose identity I shall not question
651000	655000	because I do not know and it would be distasteful of me to do so if they are indeed transgender.
656000	659000	Looks good. Is it transgender approved?
659000	663000	It's 100% transgender approved.
663000	664000	Alright.
664000	670000	I also found out through the transgender community that some of them actually keep their voice the same way.
670000	677000	So going through the requirement checklist, penis, you're allowed to have voice, you're allowed to have
677000	683000	technically speaking I would be considered somebody just starting their transgender transformation.
683000	686000	Let's go into some girls' bathrooms and see what they think.
686000	691000	The point is that speaking to one transgender person does not count as validation for a prank.
691000	696000	And listen mate, if you want to do this and let people judge you then I'm not going to stop you.
696000	700000	But don't try and commodify the support of a transgender person as a deflection from criticism.
700000	706000	As said, it was obviously a stupid idea for multiple reasons and left people once again pretty annoyed,
706000	709000	even receiving a reaction video from H3.
709000	714000	Now let me make it clear, these videos were bad, but they were just a drop in the ocean.
714000	719000	In many regards, plenty of pranksters forced quote social experiments to try and prove something,
719000	724000	and needless to say, the numerous quote hilarious pranks in the hood have not aged well.
724000	727000	I do not think Joey would have stood out if he weren't such a character in a way,
727000	732000	the fact that he was at the forefront of a lot of his videos and he often seemed completely oblivious
732000	734000	on how to justify such content.
734000	740000	A lot of creators were smart enough not to bother trying to explain why it existed, because it shouldn't.
740000	745000	But Joey is a stubborn man, he loved to explain why this important social experiment meant something,
745000	750000	and by loading it with meaning he immediately opened it up to greater social discourse,
750000	753000	and involving himself in it explaining what the study could mean.
753000	756000	This is particularly important with his Trump card video.
756000	760000	What's up guys, Joey Salads here, and you may have seen on the internet and through the polls
760000	764000	that a lot of black people don't like Trump, and they don't even like his supporters in some cases.
764000	769000	So what I did was, I got a car, put some Trump apparel on it,
769000	772000	and we're gonna park it in a black neighbourhood and see what happens.
772000	777000	In this video, Joey parks a car in an allegedly African American community,
777000	782000	as many polls had shown that African American support for Trump had been rather derisory.
782000	785000	In the video, an African American gentleman turns up and calls his friends,
785000	788000	who then proceed to vandalise and ransack the vehicle.
788000	790000	Here's what Joey Salads concludes.
790000	794000	As you can see from this video, the black community is very violent towards Trump and his supporters.
794000	798000	Now, when I was filming this video, there were people out the window yelling,
798000	802000	F Trump. And after filming, I talked to some of the spectators who were black,
802000	807000	and said that they did low-key support Trump, but they're afraid of the backlash from their community.
807000	812000	This is in a way what makes them stand out, because although many pranksters went into the hood
812000	815000	to conduct their pranks in a rather insensitive fashion,
815000	819000	many of them acted in a provocative way that would justify reaction from anyone,
819000	823000	such as stepping on shoes or running at them, or stating some provocative slang with double meaning.
823000	828000	Joey's initial action of parking a car with Trump logos on it is not inherently provocative,
828000	832000	and therefore the implication about communities was much more politically inflammatory,
832000	836000	and given that it was fake, many people rightfully called him out for it.
836000	839000	The dangerous stereotypes that could have been enforced were quite concerning.
839000	844000	He has been confronted by creators such as H3, and has apologised since.
844000	848000	But the video is still up, and must I mention, still monetised,
848000	850000	so YouTube better treat this video right.
850000	854000	Joey's content since then has touched on many politically charged topics again,
854000	859000	and tried to provide takeaways. In a way, this should explain what has driven Joey into politics.
859000	862000	He's clearly very passionate about the modern political landscape,
862000	865000	and wants to use his content to drive a message.
865000	869000	But at the same time, given how controversial a lot of his old actions were,
869000	872000	it seems bizarre that he would involve himself in the political sphere.
872000	877000	People have been torn apart for a lot less, and he's still making this brand of videos.
877000	882000	What I'm gonna be doing today is going undercover at one of these campuses, the University of Maryland,
882000	889000	and I'm gonna be going undercover to see what they think about the LGBT treatment in Palestine.
889000	895000	Yo, Joe, one question. If you're a household name, how come you can go undercover with a hat?
895000	898000	Let's talk about his political campaign.
903000	906000	In case it isn't clear yet, Joey is a Republican.
906000	911000	He registered as a candidate in New York's 11th district on April the 30th.
911000	916000	Now for those who wonder what the hell the 11th district means, don't worry guys, I've got your back.
916000	921000	I'll explain in a bit, but for now we should really try and nail down what sort of platform Joey is running on.
921000	926000	Now like any person who's running for Congress, Joey has a page with all his political positions on it.
926000	930000	As comprehensive as ever, he covers five issues.
930000	934000	Economics, the seawall, immigration, New York, and national defense.
934000	938000	Now I'm not going to go into details, as I feel that would be unnecessary.
938000	942000	As always, I leave my links in the pinned comment if you want to read more into it.
942000	947000	He seems to come across as a rather traditional Republican with a local populist streak,
947000	952000	saying that he'll fight the current mayor, Bill de Blasio's quote IVD tyranny.
952000	955000	Ooh, that's rhetoric.
955000	959000	Essentially, as New York's 11th district covers Joey's birthplace in Staten Island,
959000	963000	Staten Island is often considered the quote forgotten borough.
963000	965000	Joey's slogan is forgotten no more.
965000	970000	It's a tactic commonly used by many people, particularly when these elections cover rather local areas,
970000	975000	a lot of problems that people encounter will be local, or at least feel local,
975000	977000	even if they derive from something more national.
977000	982000	When you see where you grew up deteriorating, and just wish it would be like it was 10 years ago,
982000	985000	that's a potent feeling that resonates with a lot of people,
986000	989000	so it's understandable why Joey would adopt such a narrative.
989000	995000	So the reason why I'm running for Congress is because I am sick and tired of seeing Staten Island
995000	1000000	and the New York City Republicans that get tossed to the side when it comes to policy
1000000	1005000	in that state, in that city, and even up to the federal level.
1005000	1009000	Too many times is the voice of Staten Island and South Brooklyn
1009000	1014000	completely ignored by de Blasio and the other Democrats in the city.
1014000	1020000	This was from his announcement video, which certainly contained some entertaining statements.
1020000	1027000	I want to start a revolution, I want to start an ideological war against Democrats.
1027000	1030000	Not a physical one, a figurative one.
1030000	1034000	We need to fight back with facts, we need to fight back with raising our voices,
1034000	1037000	we need to fight back with our influence.
1037000	1040000	The new generation will come up and they will start voting Democrat.
1040000	1043000	We need to reach the younger generation now.
1043000	1048000	So this way when they're of voting age or even coming into the voting bracket right now,
1048000	1051000	we get them voting Republican for their entire life.
1051000	1056000	I had to hire the best of the best employees because I had to pay them the minimum wage
1056000	1060000	which was draining my business account drive for that particular business.
1060000	1065000	Overall though, he speaks about how his journey has led him to this point of view,
1065000	1069000	that his business drive really makes him qualified and that he has a vision.
1069000	1071000	But I'm here to tell you, you set your own worth.
1071000	1075000	As long as you have the tools to set your own worth,
1075000	1080000	as long as the government stays out of your business, you can set your own worth.
1080000	1083000	And I want to get that message across to the youth growing up
1083000	1086000	to let them know anything's possible as long as they set their mind to it.
1086000	1090000	If you're growing up in the ghetto, if you set your mind to a specific goal
1090000	1092000	and you work towards it every day, you have the internet now,
1092000	1096000	you have the source of the knowledge of the world at the palm of your hand
1096000	1099000	where you can actually teach yourself anything you want.
1099000	1103000	His campaign has been interesting, mostly running on social media.
1103000	1108000	Alongside his prank channel, he has a personal channel which is much more opinion based
1108000	1112000	but basically just mocking a lot of political mishaps, particularly related to Democrats.
1112000	1114000	She was pandering.
1114000	1116000	She was nervous.
1116000	1121000	No, because I think she's not being honest with herself and I think she's trying to pander.
1121000	1124000	It's like when Hillary Clinton was like, I put hot sauce on everything.
1124000	1127000	And that's what she was doing, she was trying to pander to the minority.
1127000	1131000	It's fairly uneventful, but you do get to see more of his views.
1131000	1135000	One of the things that Joey constantly faces down are the allegations
1135000	1139000	that he's not informed to speak on certain issues, or that he's against a demographic.
1139000	1142000	He often responds, much like his appeal to his transgender friend,
1142000	1145000	to an appeal to the relevant demographic.
1145000	1150000	For example, Saladino alleged his Democratic opponent, I assume Max Rose in this instance,
1150000	1154000	the current representative of the district, alluded to the fact that Joey mocked the disabled.
1154000	1157000	Joey's response was, look at my disabled friend.
1157000	1160000	Joey, that's not how it works, and you know that.
1160000	1164000	Near more recent conflict on his Twitter timeline, one of Joey's tweets about his opinion
1164000	1167000	on the pro-choice, pro-life debate gained some traction,
1167000	1171000	but also quickly received backlash because of how it opened with the statement
1171000	1173000	that he had had sex thousands of times.
1174000	1177000	How much money for Bang Bang?
1177000	1180000	No? Okay. I didn't speak English.
1184000	1187000	Now I'm not here to question whether he has had sex thousands of times,
1187000	1190000	particularly given his chad-like features,
1190000	1194000	but this braggadocious way to open up a statement on a serious political discourse
1194000	1195000	rightfully attracted mockery.
1195000	1198000	When people mocked him, he turned it on them by saying,
1198000	1201000	oh I'm sorry, what's wrong with having sex?
1201000	1204000	Of course, he could just be using it as an example of experience,
1204000	1207000	but equally, aside from being a rather invalid point,
1207000	1210000	having sex does not give you experience to speak on these issues,
1210000	1213000	he must have known how his statement would have been interpreted.
1213000	1216000	After telling people that they should be having sex or they're just sad,
1216000	1221000	he remembers that one of his key voter demographics are devout Christians who wait until marriage,
1221000	1223000	and promptly backtracks on that point.
1223000	1228000	To finish this off, he then appealed to his girlfriend, who provided a woman's perspective on the issue.
1228000	1229000	Oh dear.
1229000	1234000	From a girl's perspective, I want to know, maybe it's not your perspective,
1234000	1237000	maybe it's a perspective of people that you know,
1237000	1243000	their thoughts on abortion and the selfishness that goes through their heads when thinking about abortion.
1243000	1247000	It's just kind of like a safety net you have in the back of your mind,
1247000	1252000	saying like if I do, let's say have sex one night at a club,
1252000	1257000	I do have a safety net of getting the abortion if something were to happen.
1257000	1263000	So it's kind of like an unconscious, but in the back of your mind safety net.
1263000	1269000	Now looking at this, it might seem kinda bizarre that we're even having a discussion about this political hopeful.
1269000	1274000	Well, Joey's got no chance, I see American politics on the news every day,
1274000	1277000	and you gotta establish yourself as a reputable figure, surely,
1277000	1280000	and New York is one of the democratic strongholds.
1280000	1282000	Yes, but no.
1283000	1291000	As noted here, Joey has a questionable past, most well-remembered through H3H3,
1291000	1296000	particularly when he did a run of pranks depicting the African-American community in a very negative light,
1296000	1301000	eventually escalating to the Trump car and subsequent interview with Ethan Klein regarding that,
1301000	1305000	where he was pretty much held down for the entirety of the interview.
1305000	1311000	Don't let this video judge the entire race, the entire culture off the acts of very few individuals.
1311000	1314000	You kind of specifically say the opposite of that.
1314000	1317000	As you can see, black people got really emotional.
1317000	1320000	You can see from this video, the black community is very violent towards Trump and his supporters.
1320000	1327000	You don't say black lives matter activists, you say black people in general are very hostile towards Trump supporters.
1328000	1331000	See, that's more of just a mistake on my end.
1331000	1333000	That's not something that I purposely went out like.
1333000	1338000	I meant it, the video even says black lives matter versus all lives matter supporters.
1338000	1342000	I meant it to be specific to the people who support black lives matter.
1342000	1347000	Now, as many articles on him have been quick to point out, he has made these pranks with very political intent,
1347000	1355000	and therefore, it's not completely irrelevant that they're brought forward when his eligibility to be an actual serving representative of people is considered.
1355000	1360000	Now, in his announcement video, he decides to allude to this, referring to it as his controversial past,
1360000	1362000	and here's what he had to say.
1363000	1366000	But on screen, I was a jackass, I ain't gonna lie.
1366000	1370000	I did a lot of jackass things and at the time, I never thought that I would run for Congress.
1370000	1373000	So do I regret anything I ever did in the past?
1373000	1375000	No, I don't regret a damn thing.
1375000	1376000	You wanna know why?
1376000	1383000	Because without those experiences, without me making mistakes, without me doing these particular things,
1383000	1385000	I would have never grown as a person.
1385000	1391000	You gotta take every negative thing in your life and take it as a lesson learned.
1391000	1394000	Now, on first glance, this sort of comment isn't particularly bad.
1394000	1399000	Alright, he knows what he did was wrong, he doesn't regret it, which I probably would,
1399000	1404000	but he makes up some rhetorical reason for how he's grown and I guess it's part of a politician to be stubborn.
1404000	1409000	So, okay, maybe we'll let him off, but then there's this one comment that really stuck to me.
1409000	1415000	I was a jackass, I ain't gonna lie. I did a lot of jackass things and at the time, I never thought that I would run for Congress.
1415000	1420000	At the time, he never knew he'd be running for Congress, which to me is an amusing statement to make.
1420000	1426000	You have the platform, right there, in that moment to make a sincere apology, and instead we got,
1426000	1430000	well if I'd known I'd run for Congress in the future, I'd never have done it.
1430000	1434000	Implying that he wouldn't feel the same if he wasn't running for Congress?
1434000	1440000	It's just such a terrible arrangement of words, and it perfectly encapsulates the issue with Joey Salads.
1440000	1445000	I know I said at the start we don't think about consequences sometimes when we're online,
1445000	1447000	but that's not how you express it.
1447000	1454000	Joey Salads has such a surface level understanding of many of the concepts that most people resonate with.
1454000	1459000	When you make an apology, you have to understand why you're apologising, or else even if it was an error,
1459000	1464000	even if it was a misinformed call, you're prone to making the exact same mistake again
1464000	1468000	because you're demonstrating that you don't understand why you made that mistake in the first place.
1468000	1472000	You have to understand the harm that it creates, not say, oh I'm sorry guys, please vote for me,
1472000	1476000	I didn't realise I'd be running for a job where understanding much of the social tensions is key.
1476000	1480000	Joey Salads mindlessly exploited those social tensions for personal gain,
1480000	1483000	which is hard to look past, so he has to do better.
1483000	1487000	I don't think a hokey apology should be means for cancellation completely,
1487000	1492000	people word things poorly, and you can't expect someone like Joey who's admitted he's gone off the script
1492000	1498000	to be completely clear in this instance, that I would encourage him to have a somewhat decent idea of what he's doing.
1498000	1502000	Generally, most people justifiably take a stance against cancel culture,
1502000	1506000	because we want to believe in people's ability to improve as human beings,
1506000	1509000	and we want to see them succeed under that new philosophy.
1509000	1512000	However, on the other hand, what Joey did was incredibly irresponsible,
1512000	1517000	and as someone running for public office who's going to be dealing with those specific issues,
1517000	1522000	it just seems mad that he has an expectation that people are gonna be able to let it slide,
1522000	1524000	because it was really quite terrible.
1524000	1527000	He refers to his entrepreneurial spirit with a tone of pride,
1527000	1533000	yet it was his entrepreneurial spirit that drove him to making racist social experiments.
1533000	1538000	It wasn't like someone spontaneously saying a slur or a joke that went too far, it was a business move.
1538000	1543000	Those pranks didn't materialise for any other reason, it was calculated.
1543000	1546000	The environment for pranksters back then was incredibly toxic,
1546000	1551000	and it is not impossible that the macro mindset took him over and he lost sight of what was moral,
1551000	1554000	but unfortunately that shows a weakness for financial gain.
1554000	1558000	Now, there are many politicians who've done worse things and survived scandal,
1558000	1560000	I mean, they're notorious sex pests,
1560000	1565000	but then again, Joey did stick his manhood in a plate of food on Snapchat asking fans to touch it,
1565000	1568000	so actually, on second thoughts, he might be perfect for the job.
1568000	1570000	It really is bashing time.
1570000	1572000	Once again, he's apologised for this,
1572000	1576000	but it seems it advised that he'd enter into politics without taking a break
1576000	1579000	and giving him a chance to let his character progress.
1580000	1585000	So there's pictures of him putting his dick in a hot dog bun, putting his dick in spaghetti,
1585000	1590000	he's just a lot of homoerotic stuff to be quite frank.
1590000	1593000	I think that's the final point for me.
1593000	1598000	If Joey had taken some time off YouTube, come back, a changed man, had a new philosophy,
1598000	1600000	then I think I'd be more inclined to defend him,
1600000	1605000	but he has continued with his brand of clickbait, melodramatic videos that push slanted ideology
1605000	1609000	on the basis of a few interviews or experiments that just seem uninspired,
1609000	1613000	and tell me that he really hasn't learned anything other than don't get caught,
1613000	1616000	which really isn't what you should be taking away.
1616000	1619000	Do I think he should have his career ended now for what happened?
1619000	1622000	No, he can continue doing whatever he wants to do,
1622000	1627000	but I personally don't think he's completely proved himself ready to take on public office,
1627000	1629000	regardless of the party that he identifies with.
1629000	1633000	I think that will require some additional time and self-reflection.
1633000	1639000	He speaks about how his come up is so fantastic, and yet being completely aware of its immorality.
1639000	1644000	In his campaign video, Joey Salads brands himself as the embodiment of the American Dream.
1644000	1648000	I am a living embodiment of what you can achieve with the American Dream,
1648000	1650000	and I want to share that with everybody else.
1650000	1652000	That is why I'm running.
1652000	1657000	And for me, maybe that outlines the ultimate problem with the American Dream, and Joey's campaign.
1657000	1662000	We become so fixated on wealth and success, and not about how it's achieved.
1662000	1666000	Joey may have achieved his wealth, and I can't take that away from him,
1666000	1672000	but as a public figure running for Congress, you can't pick and choose what parts of your career you want to discard
1672000	1676000	when they've been so tightly intertwined with constructing that wealth in the first place.
1676000	1681000	Joey can say that he's making moves behind the scenes, and that's what makes him eligible,
1681000	1685000	but he's still running on the platform that he established in front of the scenes,
1685000	1692000	a platform which everyone knows is a platform which he openly portrays himself and his behaviour on camera,
1692000	1695000	and he has done that in the past, and in ways that have been very destructive.
1695000	1698000	You can't deny that, and you can't really avoid that.
1698000	1703000	And unfortunately, that's why I can't provide my endorsement to Joey Salads this election cycle.
1703000	1707000	Although I don't think his past should cast an eternal shadow over his prospects,
1707000	1713000	it seems to me that he's still in the shade, and he has a way to go before he should consider running for office.
1713000	1720000	I doubt he will be elected, but in the scenario that he is, I hope he undertakes the proper responsibility of an elected official,
1720000	1722000	and is a voice for those he feels has lost it.
1722000	1728000	But you know what? Maybe this is all just Joey's most elaborate prank yet, and we've all been trolled.
1728000	1733000	Who knows? I would never put it past someone who's so successful already.
1733000	1737000	Okay, so there's the video, I hope you guys enjoyed, I hope you took something away from it,
1737000	1741000	I'd love to hear your thoughts on the topic in the comments section below.
