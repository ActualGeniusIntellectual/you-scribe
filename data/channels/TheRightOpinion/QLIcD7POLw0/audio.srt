1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,360
Cut the head in half have your halves cut these pieces into smaller pieces

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the right minion, haha, the home of an epic gamer with too much free time.

3
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm running on like 4 hours of sleep and my life is misery, how are you today? That was a rhetorical question, you can't answer it because this is pre-recorded,

4
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
though obviously you can comment it so I wasn't thinking that far ahead.

5
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Some of you may be asking, but Trove, James, my mate, why is your life misery? Well a multitude of reasons,

6
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,000
but I tell you recently, all this drama has had my brain fried, so much going on in the world that I need to catch up on,

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:20,000
which honestly, with all my other commitments, does not electrify me with enthusiasm. It drove me insane to the point where I decided to relax by playing a video game,

8
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
but in the end I just stayed up until 8am, letting my sanity further deteriorates.

9
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Though I did complete the game, so you know what? I thought, who needs trending topics anyway? How about we do something a bit more out of left field,

10
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:40,000
a bit more fun? Hey, I like fun, that's the sort of thing that gets me up in the morning on top of my parents' crippling expectations.

11
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Haha, now many of you may be wondering why I'm in such a hilarious mood today, well it's because we're going to the ever hilarious genre of pranksters.

12
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Pranksters are a legendary genre on YouTube, if you are not at least familiar with one prankster out of the countless controversies that they have brought us,

13
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:04,000
then you're either not looking hard enough, or you might even have a life. But either way, they reigned supreme for a few years throughout the mid 2010s,

14
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:12,000
and there are many still going to this day. The thing is that although the golden era may be long behind us, those pranksters still made a lot of money,

15
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:20,000
and we're not talking about loose change here, some of the most viewed videos have over 100 million views. It was repulsive in a way, but that's what people wanted.

16
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Now being a YouTuber isn't just about creating videos, for some of us it is, because we get turned off by all the additional business work,

17
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I know it's always a gruel for me, but when you're a prankster, there is a very fine craft. You see, although these videos may get you millions on top of millions,

18
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:43,000
and in some instances even billions of views while you're making it big in the game, there is basically no longevity.

19
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Eventually, once you've milked every single idea dry, people will begin to see that there's nothing really to stick around for.

20
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:58,000
And on principle, this isn't inherently true, just because someone makes prank videos doesn't mean they suddenly have an inability to make videos in other genres,

21
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I mean someone who did manage to sensationally transfer their skill set was Roman Atwood, a person who really did incredibly well considering how moronic much of his content was.

22
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:15,000
However, that's the thing, prank videos didn't blow off the real connection between the audience and the prankster, the closest you might have got was FusiTube maybe,

23
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:22,000
but that's only because he loaded his content with ham-fisted social messages that won over audiences with fairly low bars of expectation.

24
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Most other pranksters either became extremely infamous very quickly and then quickly lost it, or were mostly invisible behind their inane pranks.

25
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
This is likely because some of them don't really have much going for them otherwise.

26
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Make no mistake, I almost do have a grudging respect for how much they put themselves through to turn out content for the sake of views,

27
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,000
you need to have an incredible amount of drive to do that. But that's all it is a lot of the time, drive,

28
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
and the ability to pick out the most provocative topics that will interest people.

29
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
One of the people who certainly embodies this idea is Joey Salads.

30
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Joey Salads, or Joey Saladino, is one of the more politically charged pranksters.

31
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
His pranks, or quote social experiments, have caused him controversy over time.

32
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
He's been on and off the grid for a while, you probably know him for his multiple run-ins with H3.

33
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
However, he is more than just a prankster, he is now a politician in waiting.

34
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Now some of my friends interacted with Joey at last year's VidCon, which I was at, but I never got the chance to have a conversation.

35
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,000
But either way, they received the big Joey Salads follow, and since then, they have been keeping up with what he's doing,

36
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,000
and obviously this little stunt being one of the newest, most interesting developments to be going on in his life.

37
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Also, for the record, I will again be at VidCon this year, July the 10th to the 13th, definitely recommend coming.

38
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
You see, as a prankster, as long as you didn't do anything too criminal, you should be able to rebrand.

39
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:51,000
But the problem is, although you may have made a fat stack of dollar, you're somewhat limited in your scope,

40
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
particularly when it was established that most pranks were completely fabricated.

41
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:03,000
With social experiments, that was an important revelation, because a lot of the points that could be drawn from those videos had genuine social repercussions.

42
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Therefore, it made sense for a lot of pranksters to take three routes, either move into a different genre,

43
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:18,000
one not heavily reputation-based like Roman Atwood did with his family blogging, smile more, oh yeah be happy, be nice, do pranks in the hood,

44
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
actually scratch that part, I'll save that for another time.

45
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,000
The other option is to milk the pranks dry and run them into the ground, a perfect example of this would be someone like Prank Invasion,

46
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:33,000
who has recently taken to pranks that are basically incestuous and questionable in whether they're even pranks.

47
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:42,000
It basically boils down YouTube pranks to what they are, their core essence, clickbait, and all other considerations for what even qualifies as a prank can go out the window,

48
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
some people just like weird stuff and branding it under a prank makes them feel better about it.

49
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:57,000
The third option is just to carry on hustling but out of the public eye, maybe you'd go into some business, maybe you'll invest your money into Bitcoin and turn 2 million into 35,

50
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:03,000
buy a nice mansion in LA and settle down with a lovely lady or gentleman depending on who you are and what you like of course.

51
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Or the fourth option of course, be FouseyTube.

52
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:25,000
However, one option that we don't see touched on is public service, in the internet age it's difficult to go from the public internet platform into politics,

53
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
because of all the history you leave on it, as shown by people like Sargon.

54
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:36,000
When you're online you have a mindset that many of the things you say and do are much less consequential than they might be in real life,

55
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
and they are to an extent, but at the same time you can still break it down to its individual conduct,

56
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
and when you go into politics one of the hard truths is that the media will completely be at your throats,

57
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:53,000
regardless of how virtuous you truly are, the media love drama and anything they can twist their way they will,

58
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:59,000
so it seems bonkers that a prankster would run for Congress, but that is what Joey Salads has chosen to do,

59
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
with his announcement coming in late April.

60
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:07,000
So what exactly is Joey doing? Does he have a chance? How might his past affect his campaign?

61
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:13,000
And should it affect his campaign? And will he receive an endorsement from the mighty right opinion?

62
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
These are all questions that I plan to answer over the process of the next half an hour to an ample degree.

63
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I hope you'll accompany me for this journey.

64
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:33,000
So yeah, this is Joey Saladino. As said, many people probably know him for his pranks, but we'll be discussing them very soon.

65
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Let's lay down the basic facts, let's have a look at his biography, and see if we can get to know him as a person,

66
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
because that's what matters isn't it?

67
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Now looking at his bios, it's clear that either the authors of the pages have a deep adoration for our macho hero here,

68
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
or that he might just have had a hand in creating these bios.

69
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Famous birthdays credit him as the video creating phenomenon on YouTube who is known for creating funny prank videos.

70
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Such a great sentence.

71
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
And heightline are even more flattering, branding Joey as a household name,

72
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
known for uploading mind-blowing social media experiments and pranks.

73
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
So what is beyond the aggrandizing, and what do we actually know?

74
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Well, Joey was born in Staten Island in the suburb of New York, I like how they had to clarify that makes him part of the US,

75
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
clearly they know Joey's demographic well.

76
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
He grew up, attended a Catholic school, he proceeded to college, he became a pizza delivery boy,

77
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
a fairly ordinary life of a guy from a New York borough.

78
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:37,000
However, Joseph had bigger dreams, and quickly transferred from pizza delivery boy to the humor delivery boy.

79
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You see what they did there? Hey, life is suffering.

80
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:47,000
So basically Joey's catchphrase is, it's bashing time, which obviously calls back to the fact that he loves a good wank, I jest.

81
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:54,000
It's anti-relating to the fact that when he started, he used to bash various items as pranks, such as his sister's laptop,

82
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
his sister's door, his sister's computer.

83
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Honestly, his sister had it pretty rough.

84
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Please don't read into that comment, you sick, sick person.

85
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I know what you're thinking, that's disgusting, shame on you.

86
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
That's not how I meant it.

87
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Leave comments below on what I should bash next, and maybe I'll pick one.

88
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
This is the first content that he gained traction from.

89
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:19,000
There was information about a speech he did regarding the deterioration of social values allegedly going viral,

90
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
but I cannot find that, I wish I could.

91
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:27,000
He gradually moved towards more mainstream pranks, and obviously into the content that he became infamous for.

92
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
This content was rather typical of the prankster comedy around then.

93
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Cheap clickbait, hijinks, huge reaction, not exactly what I'd brand as funny, but hey, comedy is subjective.

94
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Now in defence of this article's rather slanted tone, it does highlight that Mr Saladino's YouTube career

95
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
has been ridden with pitfalls, particularly relating to some of his more distasteful pranks.

96
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
As noted here, the three that receive a bit more attention than the others,

97
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,000
though there's more to discuss later, are the Muslim vs Christian terror video,

98
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
the transgender person in women's bathroom, and the infamous trump car.

99
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
They're not just controversial because they're provocative topics,

100
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
they're controversial because they are actually terrible.

101
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Let's start with the Muslim vs Christian one, which basically presents an imminent terror threat.

102
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Now if we set aside the fact that this is almost certainly fake,

103
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,000
one of the biggest issues is that the Muslim is dressed in such stereotypically Arab clothing

104
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
that it falsely pushes a pretense that Islamic terrorism can be identified by a fashion choice.

105
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
It also doesn't help that the person acting as the Muslim ran in a much more aggressive fashion

106
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
and moved with much greater intent.

107
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,000
This video was actually removed at the start of 2019 for violating YouTube's terms of service.

108
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Then you have the transgender person in women's bathroom, which is just incredibly uncomfortable to watch.

109
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
He spends the first minute and a half trying to validate this rather awful idea

110
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:51,000
by appealing to the authority of his quote transgender friend whose identity I shall not question

111
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
because I do not know and it would be distasteful of me to do so if they are indeed transgender.

112
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Looks good. Is it transgender approved?

113
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
It's 100% transgender approved.

114
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Alright.

115
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I also found out through the transgender community that some of them actually keep their voice the same way.

116
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:17,000
So going through the requirement checklist, penis, you're allowed to have voice, you're allowed to have

117
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:23,000
technically speaking I would be considered somebody just starting their transgender transformation.

118
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Let's go into some girls' bathrooms and see what they think.

119
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,000
The point is that speaking to one transgender person does not count as validation for a prank.

120
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,000
And listen mate, if you want to do this and let people judge you then I'm not going to stop you.

121
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
But don't try and commodify the support of a transgender person as a deflection from criticism.

122
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:46,000
As said, it was obviously a stupid idea for multiple reasons and left people once again pretty annoyed,

123
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
even receiving a reaction video from H3.

124
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Now let me make it clear, these videos were bad, but they were just a drop in the ocean.

125
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,000
In many regards, plenty of pranksters forced quote social experiments to try and prove something,

126
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
and needless to say, the numerous quote hilarious pranks in the hood have not aged well.

127
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I do not think Joey would have stood out if he weren't such a character in a way,

128
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,000
the fact that he was at the forefront of a lot of his videos and he often seemed completely oblivious

129
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
on how to justify such content.

130
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:20,000
A lot of creators were smart enough not to bother trying to explain why it existed, because it shouldn't.

131
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,000
But Joey is a stubborn man, he loved to explain why this important social experiment meant something,

132
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,000
and by loading it with meaning he immediately opened it up to greater social discourse,

133
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
and involving himself in it explaining what the study could mean.

134
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
This is particularly important with his Trump card video.

135
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
What's up guys, Joey Salads here, and you may have seen on the internet and through the polls

136
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
that a lot of black people don't like Trump, and they don't even like his supporters in some cases.

137
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,000
So what I did was, I got a car, put some Trump apparel on it,

138
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
and we're gonna park it in a black neighbourhood and see what happens.

139
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,000
In this video, Joey parks a car in an allegedly African American community,

140
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:02,000
as many polls had shown that African American support for Trump had been rather derisory.

141
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
In the video, an African American gentleman turns up and calls his friends,

142
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
who then proceed to vandalise and ransack the vehicle.

143
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Here's what Joey Salads concludes.

144
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
As you can see from this video, the black community is very violent towards Trump and his supporters.

145
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Now, when I was filming this video, there were people out the window yelling,

146
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
F Trump. And after filming, I talked to some of the spectators who were black,

147
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,000
and said that they did low-key support Trump, but they're afraid of the backlash from their community.

148
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,000
This is in a way what makes them stand out, because although many pranksters went into the hood

149
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
to conduct their pranks in a rather insensitive fashion,

150
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
many of them acted in a provocative way that would justify reaction from anyone,

151
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
such as stepping on shoes or running at them, or stating some provocative slang with double meaning.

152
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Joey's initial action of parking a car with Trump logos on it is not inherently provocative,

153
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
and therefore the implication about communities was much more politically inflammatory,

154
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
and given that it was fake, many people rightfully called him out for it.

155
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
The dangerous stereotypes that could have been enforced were quite concerning.

156
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,000
He has been confronted by creators such as H3, and has apologised since.

157
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
But the video is still up, and must I mention, still monetised,

158
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
so YouTube better treat this video right.

159
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Joey's content since then has touched on many politically charged topics again,

160
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,000
and tried to provide takeaways. In a way, this should explain what has driven Joey into politics.

161
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
He's clearly very passionate about the modern political landscape,

162
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
and wants to use his content to drive a message.

163
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
But at the same time, given how controversial a lot of his old actions were,

164
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
it seems bizarre that he would involve himself in the political sphere.

165
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,000
People have been torn apart for a lot less, and he's still making this brand of videos.

166
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:42,000
What I'm gonna be doing today is going undercover at one of these campuses, the University of Maryland,

167
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:49,000
and I'm gonna be going undercover to see what they think about the LGBT treatment in Palestine.

168
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Yo, Joe, one question. If you're a household name, how come you can go undercover with a hat?

169
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Let's talk about his political campaign.

170
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
In case it isn't clear yet, Joey is a Republican.

171
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,000
He registered as a candidate in New York's 11th district on April the 30th.

172
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Now for those who wonder what the hell the 11th district means, don't worry guys, I've got your back.

173
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I'll explain in a bit, but for now we should really try and nail down what sort of platform Joey is running on.

174
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Now like any person who's running for Congress, Joey has a page with all his political positions on it.

175
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
As comprehensive as ever, he covers five issues.

176
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Economics, the seawall, immigration, New York, and national defense.

177
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Now I'm not going to go into details, as I feel that would be unnecessary.

178
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
As always, I leave my links in the pinned comment if you want to read more into it.

179
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,000
He seems to come across as a rather traditional Republican with a local populist streak,

180
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,000
saying that he'll fight the current mayor, Bill de Blasio's quote IVD tyranny.

181
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Ooh, that's rhetoric.

182
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Essentially, as New York's 11th district covers Joey's birthplace in Staten Island,

183
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Staten Island is often considered the quote forgotten borough.

184
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Joey's slogan is forgotten no more.

185
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,000
It's a tactic commonly used by many people, particularly when these elections cover rather local areas,

186
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,000
a lot of problems that people encounter will be local, or at least feel local,

187
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
even if they derive from something more national.

188
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,000
When you see where you grew up deteriorating, and just wish it would be like it was 10 years ago,

189
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
that's a potent feeling that resonates with a lot of people,

190
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
so it's understandable why Joey would adopt such a narrative.

191
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:35,000
So the reason why I'm running for Congress is because I am sick and tired of seeing Staten Island

192
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:40,000
and the New York City Republicans that get tossed to the side when it comes to policy

193
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,000
in that state, in that city, and even up to the federal level.

194
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Too many times is the voice of Staten Island and South Brooklyn

195
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:54,000
completely ignored by de Blasio and the other Democrats in the city.

196
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:00,000
This was from his announcement video, which certainly contained some entertaining statements.

197
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I want to start a revolution, I want to start an ideological war against Democrats.

198
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Not a physical one, a figurative one.

199
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
We need to fight back with facts, we need to fight back with raising our voices,

200
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
we need to fight back with our influence.

201
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
The new generation will come up and they will start voting Democrat.

202
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
We need to reach the younger generation now.

203
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,000
So this way when they're of voting age or even coming into the voting bracket right now,

204
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
we get them voting Republican for their entire life.

205
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I had to hire the best of the best employees because I had to pay them the minimum wage

206
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
which was draining my business account drive for that particular business.

207
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Overall though, he speaks about how his journey has led him to this point of view,

208
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
that his business drive really makes him qualified and that he has a vision.

209
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
But I'm here to tell you, you set your own worth.

210
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
As long as you have the tools to set your own worth,

211
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:00,000
as long as the government stays out of your business, you can set your own worth.

212
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
And I want to get that message across to the youth growing up

213
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
to let them know anything's possible as long as they set their mind to it.

214
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
If you're growing up in the ghetto, if you set your mind to a specific goal

215
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
and you work towards it every day, you have the internet now,

216
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
you have the source of the knowledge of the world at the palm of your hand

217
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
where you can actually teach yourself anything you want.

218
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,000
His campaign has been interesting, mostly running on social media.

219
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Alongside his prank channel, he has a personal channel which is much more opinion based

220
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
but basically just mocking a lot of political mishaps, particularly related to Democrats.

221
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
She was pandering.

222
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
She was nervous.

223
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,000
No, because I think she's not being honest with herself and I think she's trying to pander.

224
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
It's like when Hillary Clinton was like, I put hot sauce on everything.

225
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
And that's what she was doing, she was trying to pander to the minority.

226
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
It's fairly uneventful, but you do get to see more of his views.

227
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,000
One of the things that Joey constantly faces down are the allegations

228
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
that he's not informed to speak on certain issues, or that he's against a demographic.

229
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
He often responds, much like his appeal to his transgender friend,

230
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
to an appeal to the relevant demographic.

231
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,000
For example, Saladino alleged his Democratic opponent, I assume Max Rose in this instance,

232
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
the current representative of the district, alluded to the fact that Joey mocked the disabled.

233
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Joey's response was, look at my disabled friend.

234
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Joey, that's not how it works, and you know that.

235
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Near more recent conflict on his Twitter timeline, one of Joey's tweets about his opinion

236
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
on the pro-choice, pro-life debate gained some traction,

237
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
but also quickly received backlash because of how it opened with the statement

238
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
that he had had sex thousands of times.

239
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
How much money for Bang Bang?

240
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
No? Okay. I didn't speak English.

241
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Now I'm not here to question whether he has had sex thousands of times,

242
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
particularly given his chad-like features,

243
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
but this braggadocious way to open up a statement on a serious political discourse

244
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
rightfully attracted mockery.

245
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
When people mocked him, he turned it on them by saying,

246
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
oh I'm sorry, what's wrong with having sex?

247
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Of course, he could just be using it as an example of experience,

248
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
but equally, aside from being a rather invalid point,

249
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
having sex does not give you experience to speak on these issues,

250
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
he must have known how his statement would have been interpreted.

251
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
After telling people that they should be having sex or they're just sad,

252
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,000
he remembers that one of his key voter demographics are devout Christians who wait until marriage,

253
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
and promptly backtracks on that point.

254
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,000
To finish this off, he then appealed to his girlfriend, who provided a woman's perspective on the issue.

255
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Oh dear.

256
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,000
From a girl's perspective, I want to know, maybe it's not your perspective,

257
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
maybe it's a perspective of people that you know,

258
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:43,000
their thoughts on abortion and the selfishness that goes through their heads when thinking about abortion.

259
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
It's just kind of like a safety net you have in the back of your mind,

260
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:52,000
saying like if I do, let's say have sex one night at a club,

261
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I do have a safety net of getting the abortion if something were to happen.

262
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:03,000
So it's kind of like an unconscious, but in the back of your mind safety net.

263
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Now looking at this, it might seem kinda bizarre that we're even having a discussion about this political hopeful.

264
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Well, Joey's got no chance, I see American politics on the news every day,

265
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
and you gotta establish yourself as a reputable figure, surely,

266
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
and New York is one of the democratic strongholds.

267
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Yes, but no.

268
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:31,000
As noted here, Joey has a questionable past, most well-remembered through H3H3,

269
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:36,000
particularly when he did a run of pranks depicting the African-American community in a very negative light,

270
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,000
eventually escalating to the Trump car and subsequent interview with Ethan Klein regarding that,

271
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,000
where he was pretty much held down for the entirety of the interview.

272
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Don't let this video judge the entire race, the entire culture off the acts of very few individuals.

273
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
You kind of specifically say the opposite of that.

274
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
As you can see, black people got really emotional.

275
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
You can see from this video, the black community is very violent towards Trump and his supporters.

276
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:07,000
You don't say black lives matter activists, you say black people in general are very hostile towards Trump supporters.

277
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
See, that's more of just a mistake on my end.

278
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
That's not something that I purposely went out like.

279
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I meant it, the video even says black lives matter versus all lives matter supporters.

280
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I meant it to be specific to the people who support black lives matter.

281
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Now, as many articles on him have been quick to point out, he has made these pranks with very political intent,

282
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:35,000
and therefore, it's not completely irrelevant that they're brought forward when his eligibility to be an actual serving representative of people is considered.

283
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Now, in his announcement video, he decides to allude to this, referring to it as his controversial past,

284
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
and here's what he had to say.

285
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
But on screen, I was a jackass, I ain't gonna lie.

286
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I did a lot of jackass things and at the time, I never thought that I would run for Congress.

287
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
So do I regret anything I ever did in the past?

288
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
No, I don't regret a damn thing.

289
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
You wanna know why?

290
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Because without those experiences, without me making mistakes, without me doing these particular things,

291
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I would have never grown as a person.

292
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:11,000
You gotta take every negative thing in your life and take it as a lesson learned.

293
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Now, on first glance, this sort of comment isn't particularly bad.

294
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Alright, he knows what he did was wrong, he doesn't regret it, which I probably would,

295
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:24,000
but he makes up some rhetorical reason for how he's grown and I guess it's part of a politician to be stubborn.

296
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,000
So, okay, maybe we'll let him off, but then there's this one comment that really stuck to me.

297
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I was a jackass, I ain't gonna lie. I did a lot of jackass things and at the time, I never thought that I would run for Congress.

298
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,000
At the time, he never knew he'd be running for Congress, which to me is an amusing statement to make.

299
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:46,000
You have the platform, right there, in that moment to make a sincere apology, and instead we got,

300
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,000
well if I'd known I'd run for Congress in the future, I'd never have done it.

301
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Implying that he wouldn't feel the same if he wasn't running for Congress?

302
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:00,000
It's just such a terrible arrangement of words, and it perfectly encapsulates the issue with Joey Salads.

303
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,000
I know I said at the start we don't think about consequences sometimes when we're online,

304
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
but that's not how you express it.

305
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Joey Salads has such a surface level understanding of many of the concepts that most people resonate with.

306
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,000
When you make an apology, you have to understand why you're apologising, or else even if it was an error,

307
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:24,000
even if it was a misinformed call, you're prone to making the exact same mistake again

308
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
because you're demonstrating that you don't understand why you made that mistake in the first place.

309
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,000
You have to understand the harm that it creates, not say, oh I'm sorry guys, please vote for me,

310
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,000
I didn't realise I'd be running for a job where understanding much of the social tensions is key.

311
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Joey Salads mindlessly exploited those social tensions for personal gain,

312
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
which is hard to look past, so he has to do better.

313
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,000
I don't think a hokey apology should be means for cancellation completely,

314
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:52,000
people word things poorly, and you can't expect someone like Joey who's admitted he's gone off the script

315
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:58,000
to be completely clear in this instance, that I would encourage him to have a somewhat decent idea of what he's doing.

316
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Generally, most people justifiably take a stance against cancel culture,

317
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,000
because we want to believe in people's ability to improve as human beings,

318
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
and we want to see them succeed under that new philosophy.

319
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
However, on the other hand, what Joey did was incredibly irresponsible,

320
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:17,000
and as someone running for public office who's going to be dealing with those specific issues,

321
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:22,000
it just seems mad that he has an expectation that people are gonna be able to let it slide,

322
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
because it was really quite terrible.

323
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
He refers to his entrepreneurial spirit with a tone of pride,

324
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:33,000
yet it was his entrepreneurial spirit that drove him to making racist social experiments.

325
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:38,000
It wasn't like someone spontaneously saying a slur or a joke that went too far, it was a business move.

326
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Those pranks didn't materialise for any other reason, it was calculated.

327
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
The environment for pranksters back then was incredibly toxic,

328
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:51,000
and it is not impossible that the macro mindset took him over and he lost sight of what was moral,

329
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
but unfortunately that shows a weakness for financial gain.

330
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Now, there are many politicians who've done worse things and survived scandal,

331
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
I mean, they're notorious sex pests,

332
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:05,000
but then again, Joey did stick his manhood in a plate of food on Snapchat asking fans to touch it,

333
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
so actually, on second thoughts, he might be perfect for the job.

334
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
It really is bashing time.

335
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Once again, he's apologised for this,

336
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
but it seems it advised that he'd enter into politics without taking a break

337
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
and giving him a chance to let his character progress.

338
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,000
So there's pictures of him putting his dick in a hot dog bun, putting his dick in spaghetti,

339
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:30,000
he's just a lot of homoerotic stuff to be quite frank.

340
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
I think that's the final point for me.

341
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:38,000
If Joey had taken some time off YouTube, come back, a changed man, had a new philosophy,

342
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
then I think I'd be more inclined to defend him,

343
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,000
but he has continued with his brand of clickbait, melodramatic videos that push slanted ideology

344
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,000
on the basis of a few interviews or experiments that just seem uninspired,

345
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,000
and tell me that he really hasn't learned anything other than don't get caught,

346
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
which really isn't what you should be taking away.

347
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Do I think he should have his career ended now for what happened?

348
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
No, he can continue doing whatever he wants to do,

349
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:07,000
but I personally don't think he's completely proved himself ready to take on public office,

350
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
regardless of the party that he identifies with.

351
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,000
I think that will require some additional time and self-reflection.

352
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:19,000
He speaks about how his come up is so fantastic, and yet being completely aware of its immorality.

353
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:24,000
In his campaign video, Joey Salads brands himself as the embodiment of the American Dream.

354
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,000
I am a living embodiment of what you can achieve with the American Dream,

355
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
and I want to share that with everybody else.

356
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
That is why I'm running.

357
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,000
And for me, maybe that outlines the ultimate problem with the American Dream, and Joey's campaign.

358
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:42,000
We become so fixated on wealth and success, and not about how it's achieved.

359
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Joey may have achieved his wealth, and I can't take that away from him,

360
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:52,000
but as a public figure running for Congress, you can't pick and choose what parts of your career you want to discard

361
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
when they've been so tightly intertwined with constructing that wealth in the first place.

362
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Joey can say that he's making moves behind the scenes, and that's what makes him eligible,

363
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,000
but he's still running on the platform that he established in front of the scenes,

364
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:12,000
a platform which everyone knows is a platform which he openly portrays himself and his behaviour on camera,

365
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
and he has done that in the past, and in ways that have been very destructive.

366
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
You can't deny that, and you can't really avoid that.

367
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,000
And unfortunately, that's why I can't provide my endorsement to Joey Salads this election cycle.

368
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Although I don't think his past should cast an eternal shadow over his prospects,

369
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:33,000
it seems to me that he's still in the shade, and he has a way to go before he should consider running for office.

370
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:40,000
I doubt he will be elected, but in the scenario that he is, I hope he undertakes the proper responsibility of an elected official,

371
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
and is a voice for those he feels has lost it.

372
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:48,000
But you know what? Maybe this is all just Joey's most elaborate prank yet, and we've all been trolled.

373
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Who knows? I would never put it past someone who's so successful already.

374
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Okay, so there's the video, I hope you guys enjoyed, I hope you took something away from it,

375
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,000
I'd love to hear your thoughts on the topic in the comments section below.

376
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,000
I'd love to give a big shoutout to the editors, they've once again done a fantastic job,

377
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:10,000
I really can't express how thankful I am for them, I'm gonna leave their links in the pinned comment,

378
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
definitely go and check them out if you have the time, send them some love,

379
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
they really do deserve it, they're great people.

380
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Also, I wanna give a big thanks to my Patreons, $10 patreons up on the screen right now, thank you so much guys,

381
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,000
and also individual mentions to some hullabaloo on $50.

382
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Also, cheeky thank you to my other $50 patreon, Dual Angel One, they donated towards the end of last month,

383
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:38,000
and therefore I got them in the initial draft, but they are here now, so thank you very very much.

384
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:46,000
And Evening Steel and Brandon on $100, you guys are mad, fantastic, I'm genuinely astounded by your commitment,

385
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:53,000
it means so much to me, if you wanna reach me, you can get me on Twitter, at The Right Opinion, on Facebook, on Discord too,

386
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,000
all those links will be in the pinned comment, I do not really have too much else to add,

387
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
apart from the fact that I hope you enjoyed this video, and I hope your week is going ok,

388
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:06,000
mine's a bit mental, but we'll get through. Until then, I'm The Right Opinion, and I'll see you in the next one.

389
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Bye!
