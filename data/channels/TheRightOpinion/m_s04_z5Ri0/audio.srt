00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,340
Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time,

2
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:15,740
and who is the man behind this channel, who am I? Well, to be honest, it's not really of great importance,

3
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:21,680
and I'd prefer to keep my identity mostly private, although at this point it's a bit late for that, big shout out to the news website

4
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:27,280
who published my name. However, it doesn't have much significance in the general discussion, because I'm just one person

5
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:33,200
presenting what they know and what they think, and honestly, people behind respective YouTube channels aren't that important

6
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:39,440
in the grand scheme of things, and therefore it seems so bizarre in a way that today's situation comes across as much more

7
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:46,920
important to many creators than it would appear on the surface. But let's go back to the Tea community, because what's wrong with a bit of tea?

8
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:55,120
The Tea community has a lot of players in its complex game, firstly the large beauty creators who produce content for millions of individuals.

9
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:01,640
This content is fairly unproblematic on principle, but as observed, their demeanour can be quite melodramatic,

10
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:07,800
and there's a reason why the word melodramatic has the word drama in it. Along with drama came people with opinions on that drama,

11
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:13,520
and people who would look at the drama and analyse the drama. Who would have thought? You might even say that some of these channels

12
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:19,880
provided commentary. Now, typically the people who provided commentary were individuals with some level of proficiency

13
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:26,280
in the reporting of this drama. Their style may not exactly be for everyone, but they have an audience, and it seems that many of them

14
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:33,840
are legitimately invested in the outcome of this drama. Many of these creators are quite tabloid, and some are as dramatic as the genre they cover,

15
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:40,800
and honestly, that's alright, as long as people don't come to expect anything more from those channels, that's what commentary is,

16
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:48,400
opinion based ideas, and if you disagree with that person, that's okay too. However, at the same time, some people may want a more in-depth

17
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:55,280
perspective on YouTube drama. A lot of commentators aren't the most involved in that, and that's perfectly normal too, not everyone has the time

18
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:02,200
to sit down for a 30 minute summary of something that really isn't the most consequential in their life. Nonetheless, there is a demand,

19
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:08,800
and that demand exists in every genre, so as natural within the beauty community, eventually a channel would emerge with a bit more focus

20
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:15,920
on creating long-form content that focuses on the delivery and the depth of the information rather than merely the gut reaction to it.

21
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,320
The channel that appeared to answer these prayers was a creator by the name of Spill. Like the fairly simplistic name, their content never

22
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:29,360
assumes too much about the subjects that they're covering, and focuses more on the delivery of this information in a journalistic and well-cited way,

23
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:36,800
with the conclusions often being well informed and providing some sort of additional insight. They started their channel on the 5th of September 2018,

24
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:44,160
and in the following year have accumulated a pretty healthy 930,000 subscribers. They often receive praise from many audiences and creators

25
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:50,720
who were representing information in an unbiased and thorough fashion. Spill also appeared to be creating this more deeply rooted nexus,

26
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:58,800
which is our word of the day by the way. This was represented by three additional channels, Brew, Grill, and On The Hill, which all have their own dynamic,

27
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:07,520
they were good at what they did. However, perhaps a little too good. In the last couple months, suspicions have been aroused regarding Spill's existence,

28
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:15,120
and if everything is as you would typically assume it would be. What do I mean? Well, as said, many people have expectations for these channels,

29
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:22,560
and commentary channels are typically expected to be a bit more personal, because it's hard to exactly represent opinions of a corporation.

30
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:29,280
With that said, Spill walked the line of actual opinions, and now estrayed too far from the safety of what they could present as actual evidence.

31
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:37,120
However, some felt that their content, although of good quality, was not what should be representing a community, for reasons that we will debate in due time.

32
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:44,480
A few YouTubers, including D'Angelo and Petty Page published videos where they expressed concerns regarding Spill's channel origins,

33
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:50,800
and the idea that they actually represented this corporatisation of even YouTube's most independent genres.

34
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:58,800
Their sanitary, family-friendly nature was somewhat discomforting, and people then began to create further hypotheses about the nature of their existence.

35
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:04,000
Were they being planted by YouTube themselves to deal with these pesky independent creators?

36
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,600
Or to create the perception that YouTube is just this squeaky clean platform for advertisers, or the media?

37
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:16,080
Given their incredible growth, it was an unsettling thought, and this led many to theorise about the origins of such a channel.

38
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:21,440
Paired with the demonetisation and censorship that has been vented by frustrated creators within this community,

39
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,200
this led many to believe that there may be a greater agenda at stake.

40
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:30,960
However, with all the uncertainty swelling, Spill decided to explain their origins in a video themselves.

41
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,080
Spill started out as a two-person passion project.

42
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:39,120
One of us has a background in journalism, the other has a background in illustration and video editing.

43
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,160
We both love YouTube news and drama. Who doesn't?

44
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,480
We wanted to create a channel that had a more journalistic approach to YouTube drama,

45
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:50,560
a thorough recap of all sides of a story, with proper citations.

46
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,760
On top of that, we wanted to give something back to the community,

47
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:57,120
by contributing to the conversation with an educational approach.

48
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:01,280
Keeping tabs on celebrities and influencers is something many of us like to do.

49
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:07,760
It's a guilty pleasure, but it can get toxic, so that's why we discussed the big issues and opened the conversation.

50
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:11,840
In this video, they state that Spill originated as a two-person passion project,

51
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,280
which is more focused on presenting drama from a neutral perspective.

52
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:20,320
This meant that often when covering these topics, given the immense workload they would have to go through to create this,

53
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,560
when they realised that they were actually ascertaining a significant level of success,

54
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,240
they decided that more people would be necessary to help expand on this project,

55
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,720
and eventually this led to their own side projects, including Brew, Grill, and On The Hill.

56
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,040
Ultimately, the core principle that they started off believing in still stood true,

57
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:41,280
their commitment to delivering content from those principles had not changed.

58
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,840
They note that they have incorporated themselves,

59
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,040
however this was only from the perspective that they would have a lot of people,

60
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:50,400
and that it was easier to incorporate themselves for tax purposes.

61
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:55,520
It initially started as a side project, but once Spill started to grow, the team grew too.

62
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,360
This way, we can put out more high-quality videos at a faster pace.

63
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,880
But at the end of the day, we're still individual content creators,

64
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,560
who love what we do and are proud of the work we put into our videos.

65
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,160
As soon as more than one person is working on a big project together,

66
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,600
it's legally the best option to register as a corporation.

67
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,480
In Canada, there are three types of business structures.

68
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:19,520
Sole Proprietorship, Partnership, and Corporation.

69
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:24,240
A Sole Proprietorship is an unincorporated business owned by one person, like a graphic

70
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:29,200
designer. A Partnership is a joint relationship between two or more individuals working on a

71
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:33,760
business together, but each person is personally responsible for profits and losses.

72
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:39,040
The final option, the Corporation, tends to be the best option for teams of more than one person

73
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:43,600
because, among other reasons, it offers limited risk for the owners of the company.

74
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,960
Basically, you're only on the hook for what you invest in the company,

75
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,600
rather than everything you own as an individual.

76
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,720
So for many self-employed people or small businesses,

77
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,440
it makes more sense to incorporate for tax reasons.

78
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,960
They provide a few sources that justify their reasoning, and state they have no

79
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,160
contacts at YouTube, and there's no evidence to disprove this.

80
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,560
It all seems very reasonable on the surface, and in a regular, surface-level world,

81
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,040
we would be able to continue with our daily lives.

82
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:12,880
But behind the scenes, something was brewing, and it wasn't just tea.

83
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,800
Join me today as I tell you an interesting little story about a child that wasn't quite

84
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,800
as crystal clear as they could have been, and exactly why that might have been,

85
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,560
and if it even matters at all.

86
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,000
But I wouldn't begin to make such a video if it didn't matter, would I?

87
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,280
Well, there's only one way to find out.

88
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,160
Let us begin.

89
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,040
On the surface, it seems bizarre that someone would not be entirely honest about their channel's

90
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,920
origin unless they were money laundering or something.

91
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:47,520
So you'd really need the evidence that things aren't as they seem.

92
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,600
However, one of the people I mentioned earlier, Petty Page, released another video rebutting

93
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:55,200
this reveal video, and presenting some interesting information herself.

94
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:59,680
In her video, she outlines how in fact the corporation that Spill appears to be registered

95
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:05,920
under is not their own, but in fact another corporation named AWED, whose existence seems

96
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,560
to have been conceived around 2013.

97
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,280
This evidence can be found on the Canadian website.

98
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,120
What makes Petty think that this specific corporation is the one in charge of Spill?

99
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,960
Well, there is a lot of considerable evidence relating to the employees, and most notably

100
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,240
those who have themselves as working for both Spill and AWED.

101
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,880
Arguably the most incriminating factor was the fact that the voice of Spill, a person

102
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:30,720
named Taylor Barrett, had Spill listed under AWED Corp.

103
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,280
There was also some pretty compelling circumstantial observations, such as the fact that in the

104
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:39,680
time that Brew was set up, there was a decrease in posting on other AWED owned sites, such

105
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,080
as GoodGood and their relative Facebook pages.

106
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,560
That energy must have been going into something.

107
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,000
However, that didn't necessarily prove that AWED set up the channel.

108
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
A few months ago, I covered a situation regarding Smosh, and how they were bought out by another

109
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,560
network.

110
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,320
If that was the case, why did they claim in their video that they had incorporated themselves

111
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,920
with emphasis on tax perspectives, rather than just saying they had contracted with

112
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,520
the larger corporation?

113
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:05,360
The corporation that Spill is listed under is called AWED Corp.

114
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:10,640
Now, I looked online and found out that AWED Corp became incorporated in 2013.

115
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:15,360
I even paid the Canadian government to get AWED Corp's Certificate of Incorporation,

116
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:20,800
meaning that the person behind Spill, Taylor, would have been 17-18 years old when it became

117
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,320
a corporation, so something wasn't adding up.

118
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,680
On top of this, the fact that the two people who were alleged to have founded the channel

119
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:32,320
were still working side jobs to suffice income, on a channel that could prospectively be making

120
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,640
hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, told people that it had to be some main beneficiary,

121
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,800
because it really didn't make sense otherwise.

122
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,960
And I'm not one to overstate the potential right now, but these people are throwing money

123
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,120
away, but we'll get to that in a bit.

124
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,280
Regardless of outcome, whether AWED had involved themselves prior or after, many believed this

125
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:55,680
would still go against the general tone of their video, which framed them as being rather

126
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,280
in control of their channels.

127
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:02,800
Canadian small businesses who want limited risk need to register as a corporation.

128
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,760
And we aren't the only YouTubers to be incorporated.

129
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:11,840
Many other individual creators and small teams are registered as either corporations or LLCs,

130
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:16,960
like Shane Dawson, Simply Nailogical, The Try Guys, and Philip DeFranco.

131
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:20,560
So you can see, registering as a corporation is complicated.

132
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,520
You may be thinking, that all sounds really boring.

133
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:26,080
Well, the truth is, it is.

134
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,640
Legal stuff is boring, even for me.

135
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,680
Even for you?

136
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,160
Are you the one who did the legal work to incorporate?

137
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:36,960
It doesn't seem like it, and I really wanted to give Spill the benefit of the doubt.

138
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,360
But this isn't mutually ambiguous language.

139
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,200
If you watched the original video, you received the impression that they, as individuals,

140
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,920
started the channel and then incorporated it afterwards, themselves, something that just

141
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:48,960
isn't true.

142
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,640
But it wasn't quite over.

143
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:55,680
You see, Spill responded, in a second video which was much more comprehensive, they open

144
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:00,400
up stating that they did not feel the details they had left out of their original video

145
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:04,960
were completely relevant to the Spill story, and honestly, this video does clear up a fair

146
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:09,280
few things, but at the same time, I think it's right to take a few issues.

147
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:14,400
They follow their intro by showing us a man known as Roland, or as Spill refers to him

148
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:19,680
as the man who made this all possible, what happens next is an inspiring rags to riches

149
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,080
story.

150
00:11:49,680 --> 00:12:10,480
I mean, it's very lovely to hear, but it doesn't really change much.

151
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:15,200
Although privilege does pervade the upper echelons of many industries, there are many

152
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,440
people with rags to riches stories as well.

153
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:22,480
It doesn't necessarily make you a great person, but good for you at least, I hated

154
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,760
having bosses too, but it doesn't make a company less corporate.

155
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:30,080
It's good to know there's a human at the centre, but that's also why it can be a problem,

156
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,520
and I'll discuss that later.

157
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:36,640
With all that in mind, it's a pretty inspiring story if it is sincere, and I'm happy that

158
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:41,200
Spill has provided Roland with levels of success, but let's get back to the grit.

159
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:46,480
Throughout the video, there is this tone that kind of tries to undercut the notion of incorporating,

160
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,640
as this fairly normal, regular thing, and it feels like they're trying to combat the

161
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:54,080
negative stigma that comes with the process of incorporation.

162
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:58,640
The three of them were sure they would outshine Reddit, so Roland incorporated Favorize.

163
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:02,000
We incorporated Favorize because we thought it was gonna be the next big thing, so why

164
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,160
wait, let's just do it right away.

165
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:08,080
We were a team of three, obviously like as a partner, you know, with partners you have

166
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:12,480
to make sure that everything is disclosed, so we did it at incorporation.

167
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,840
I actually don't think there's a problem with incorporating.

168
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,160
If you wanna do that, fine by me.

169
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,720
But I think the problem is, and Spill knows this, that how people define corporation-run

170
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:27,040
channels is very different to a channel that has been started up by an individual slash

171
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:32,240
individuals and incorporated after, otherwise they wouldn't have framed it as the latter

172
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,280
in the original video when it clearly wasn't the case.

173
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:40,000
And while a lot of people choose to do creative projects while being self-employed, as soon

174
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,720
as more than one person is working on a big project together, it's legally the best option

175
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,640
to register as a corporation.

176
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:51,440
In Canada, there are three types of business structures, sole proprietorship, partnership,

177
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,560
and corporation.

178
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:57,280
A sole proprietorship is an unincorporated business owned by one person, like a graphic

179
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:57,920
designer.

180
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:02,640
A partnership is a joint relationship between two or more individuals working on a business

181
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:06,800
together, but each person is personally responsible for profits and losses.

182
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:11,280
The final option, the corporation, tends to be the best option for teams of more than

183
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:16,000
one person because, among other reasons, it offers limited risk for the owners of the

184
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,640
company.

185
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:20,960
Basically, you're only on the hook for what you invest in the company rather than everything

186
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,640
you own as an individual.

187
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:27,360
So for many self-employed people or small businesses, it makes more sense to incorporate

188
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,320
for tax reasons.

189
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:33,760
This is something that I would say was still dishonest, even with the new information.

190
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,560
That's what was relevant to be upfront about.

191
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:41,200
I'll discuss why this distinction is important and how Spill does fall into these traps for

192
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:45,040
very soon, but Spill's video is a nice story for the origins of a channel.

193
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:49,840
However, it is mostly about Roland, who as a person, I never had an issue with.

194
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:54,480
I'd rather have a channel like Spill than most, but it doesn't mean that I can't take

195
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,560
a fair few problems with their dealings and how they represented those dealings.

196
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:04,160
You can say that the information wasn't viewed as relevant to you, but the fact remains that

197
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:08,480
it wasn't really a case of additional information that doesn't change the context of your channel

198
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:08,880
at all.

199
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:13,440
The additional information here does change the context, but being the smart creators

200
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:18,080
they are, Bill or Roland knew how to embed it in such a load of additional information

201
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:22,080
that honestly wasn't the most relevant, you kinda just forget that they even implied a

202
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,240
different story in the first place.

203
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,480
It's the polar opposite of going from not enough information to too much information,

204
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,000
but honestly, I'd rather have too much than not enough, because at least people with a

205
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,640
critical eye can extract the information that they need.

206
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:40,800
So you can see, Spill and all our other projects were self-made and started from scratch.

207
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,320
There was a lot of experimenting before we got to where we are today.

208
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:48,960
So by the end of this story, I became quite confused by this comment, because sure, they've

209
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:54,160
definitely put to bed some of the more out there ideas that they were funded by YouTube,

210
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:58,640
which were on the more conspiratorial side, and I personally wasn't persuaded by them

211
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:02,880
for reasons that I'll state later, but if you're going to go into depth about all the

212
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,800
processes that led up to the creation of the channel and the company behind it, to

213
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:11,760
suddenly say, see, it was made from scratch guys, seems rather defensive in a tonal shift

214
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,440
that hasn't really been earned.

215
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:18,720
Before this video, I totally accounted for this being a situation, being a possibility,

216
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,640
and although I will defend them on some behalfs, I also feel like they're trying to dance

217
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:27,600
out of some untruths and avoid being the centre of a discussion that is quite important.

218
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,880
What is that discussion?

219
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,240
Well, let's go there now.

220
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:38,160
After some deep thought, I really can't buy the fact that they omitted certain details

221
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,240
because they didn't believe it was relevant.

222
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:45,120
Obviously, we have the real elephant in the room that was the misleading notion of incorporation.

223
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,720
I don't want to go into too much more detail about that, because hopefully it's quite

224
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:54,080
self explanatory at this point where the contradiction comes, but also the framing of a two person

225
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:57,440
passion project did irk some people.

226
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,600
Now if what they're saying is true, the people working on this project certainly had an interest

227
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:06,000
in the topic themselves, but once again that doesn't necessarily undermine all the points

228
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,040
being made against them.

229
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:10,560
I would say that they certainly have more character than many of the corporate channels,

230
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:14,560
and to completely say they're the same would be unreasonable, but I'd also argue that there

231
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:18,720
is an element of corporate cluelessness that pervades what they do sometimes.

232
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:23,280
People's concerns about corporations is that given their pre-existing status as a business,

233
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:27,840
they may obtain unfair advantages, and lack the genuine investment in what they're doing,

234
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:32,400
and thus lead to takes that aren't in completely good faith, or partially had that, and I'm

235
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,960
going to go through all of these factors in this video, but I want to start by focusing

236
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,320
on their foundation.

237
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:43,280
As Roland explained earlier, everything started with one person and no outside help.

238
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:48,880
We had no financial support then, and we don't have financial support now, and yes, demonetisation

239
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,160
affects us a lot.

240
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,080
We make just enough to run the company and slowly grow the Spill Universe.

241
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:58,560
Whether you would consider Spill's channel made from quote scratch, I personally don't

242
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:03,840
know many YouTubers who started their channel on the back of a business specifically committed

243
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,720
to that channel with a salary already supporting them.

244
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,040
That is definitely the design of a company.

245
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:13,360
For many people, they start making content because they're interested in a topic, even

246
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:17,120
with the personal interests of the individuals in the video noted.

247
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:21,920
The story that Spill tells us, as genuinely told, it is still one of sourcing a channel

248
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24,560
for the purpose of greater company-based interest.

249
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:28,240
They obviously frame it very earnestly, talking about employee morale.

250
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:46,240
And although I respect that, I feel that there has been a bit of sugar coating in the motives

251
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:50,640
here, particularly given in the previous video they had spoken about Spill as if it was the

252
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,880
main controlling factor, which seems to be no longer true, and obviously to take into

253
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,960
consideration the fact that other Ord pages weren't the most successful at the point

254
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,280
of those other channels starting up either.

255
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:05,120
And I'll talk about that in a bit, but I feel that their story is still rooted in the

256
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:05,760
industry.

257
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:10,560
When people see that, I can understand the concern, and their behaviour hasn't exactly

258
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:13,440
embraced the from scratch approach.

259
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:18,160
The individual at the top of Ord, our good friend Roland Umarin, seems to have a history

260
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,600
of running these sorts of businesses.

261
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:24,240
He has multiple businesses to do with networking and presentation set up in the past, and it's

262
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:28,960
understandable why someone would want to include his expertise, although some have been more

263
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,880
successful than others, but alas, that is the business life after all.

264
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:37,520
I personally felt that whatever had happened, the current set up was quite reflective of

265
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:41,760
corporate involvement, rather than the two person passion project.

266
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,440
In fact, in many ways they were behaving exactly like a corporation.

267
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,360
What many of these businesses do, including Ord's good good friend, is that they have

268
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:53,040
one successful page or channel, and then begin to extend that brand.

269
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,440
That is something they even cover in the video.

270
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,920
In good good's instance, they would just stick a new suffix on the end to outline what topic

271
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:05,360
they would be covering, good good food, good good gifts, good good dildos, I don't know.

272
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:09,920
What they're doing in this bill universe is much of the same, creating these new brands

273
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,320
that are different, but also the same.

274
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:18,160
Same style, same approach, same cross promotion, and even the same ballpark of personality,

275
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:22,080
as they let that hot beverage brew up, and talk about the topic that they just can't

276
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:22,880
get enough of.

277
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,240
There's something somewhat unsettling about it to be honest.

278
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:30,560
With that noted, it does seem that Grill is slightly different in his approach, though

279
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,720
honestly, I'm not sure if I like it.

280
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:46,960
I personally don't really see the appeal, though it does give me an insight into what

281
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:50,240
roast content would be like if it was done by a Canadian.

282
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:54,720
However, I am sure though, I definitely dislike On The Hill, which seems to be the sort of

283
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:59,200
thing that a corporation would undoubtedly greenlight and produce.

284
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,480
They're not doing themselves any favours, I mean, that voice acting.

285
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:22,640
Hello fellow YouTubers, I do YouTube, my parents do not want me to do YouTube, I am defying

286
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:27,520
my parents, I am definitely a three dimensional fleshed out character, did I mention I want

287
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,640
to be a YouTuber?

288
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,600
Please help me, please.

289
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:37,200
Also, I really despise, strong word I know, how all the characters resemble pop vinyls.

290
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,520
Pop vinyls are bad and emotionless enough as they are, they're even less effective when

291
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:46,560
you try to actually give them personalities that contrast with that vacuum of a face.

292
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:51,360
I'm going off piece here, but what I mean is that it all seems to me in its current

293
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:55,760
form to be a bit too corporate for my liking, and I'll go into more detail about that

294
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,260
in a bit.

295
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:01,760
Now, of course, it is possible that that behaviour has developed from the individuals working

296
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:06,080
with the corporation, and their experience has taught them how to develop such a network,

297
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:10,160
but even then that doesn't really counteract the other points that have been brought up,

298
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:14,480
and at best they've omitted information to paint a misleading image of their business,

299
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:19,680
at worst they've actively lied, but that's why we should move to our next few questions.

300
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,880
Why would they?

301
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,840
Would anyone have cared if they were a corporation?

302
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,920
Would anyone have cared if they were working for a corporation?

303
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,360
Should anyone have cared?

304
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:33,360
Well, these are all interesting questions, and I want to talk about all of them too.

305
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:39,680
I'm going to play you a clip that was found in research for another video that isn't happening

306
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,280
now, which is a great shame.

307
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:45,520
It's unfair to even consider T-Series a big YouTuber, and this has been a huge problem

308
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:49,680
on YouTube for so long, corporations and businesses essentially taking over YouTube.

309
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:53,040
I don't think there's anything inherently wrong with businesses being on YouTube.

310
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,000
It's smart.

311
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,920
YouTube is a huge platform.

312
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,920
Why not take advantage of its insane reach?

313
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:02,800
Plus, as a fan of TV shows, I really like being able to rewatch interviews, sketches,

314
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:05,280
and performances after the show airs.

315
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:09,440
That being said, the increasing presence of major corporations forces out independent

316
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,240
creators, the people who made YouTube what it is today.

317
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,920
This has become increasingly stressful for independent creators because they can't keep

318
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,800
up with YouTube.

319
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:20,400
That's why we've been seeing more and more YouTubers leaving or going on a break.

320
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,520
They're burnt out.

321
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,360
And that's not the only discouraging thing.

322
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,960
Take a scroll through the trending page.

323
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,320
The majority of it is late night shows, companies, and music videos.

324
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,360
And have you noticed celebrities are taking over the platform too?

325
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,480
It's so smart.

326
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:36,240
Corporations know we love celebrities, so they make stars seem more accessible to us

327
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,680
by putting them on YouTube.

328
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:40,640
But in reality, there's a huge production team behind it.

329
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:45,040
So you can see, T-Series taking over as a top YouTube channel is really more symbolic

330
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:48,800
of how YouTube has become more corporation friendly, hurting the independent creators

331
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,000
who made it big.

332
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,000
It's not hard to be somewhat amused at the irony of such a statement, and honestly, I

333
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,720
feel that this is one of the key problems straight out the gate.

334
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:01,520
As said, on principle, bar exceptional circumstances, it doesn't matter the foundations that I

335
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:05,120
founded this channel on, it's the journey that has led me here today, and I'd hoped

336
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,000
that people would be able to judge me on the basis of that.

337
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,880
But if I was to make a story about my origins, and I left out certain details that were kinda

338
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:16,960
important, and it painted a picture that was very different to the one that was the actual

339
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,480
case, then I think people would have reason to feel misled or annoyed.

340
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:25,920
However, it does go deeper than that, because when we create a channel often based off our

341
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:30,560
own personality, we do create a connection, and as a principle, as a case of morality

342
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:35,680
here, I would expect people to create connections of genuine information, of genuine beliefs.

343
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:40,000
Now there is a stigma around corporations, which we'll discuss in a moment, but I would

344
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,400
have rather still make it clear what the picture resembles first time round rather than being

345
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:49,600
selected with the information that they presented, especially their channel which prides themselves

346
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,680
on presenting all sides.

347
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:55,520
As a principle, being straight with your audience about such information will follow through

348
00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:00,000
into statements on general integrity as they are underlined by the same principles.

349
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,600
It's clear to me that Spill were aware of the problems that presenting themselves as

350
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:08,640
more corporate than many assume may have brought, but with that said, I can understand why they

351
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,920
may have been hesitant to be forthcoming about that information.

352
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:15,280
Nonetheless, people are persistent twats, and whether you tell them or not, they're

353
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,800
gonna find out for themselves.

354
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,160
So what are the problems?

355
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:23,120
Obviously, there has been a narrative of recent that corporations are taking over YouTube,

356
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,520
and that has caused concern within many communities.

357
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:29,840
In certain communities, creators have been completely ejected by the big machine, with

358
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:34,800
YouTube channels like Jimmy Kimmel Live basically monopolising the YouTube homepage, and pushing

359
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:39,120
out more independent creators whose content may be less wholesome or family friendly,

360
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,360
but no less quality in its content.

361
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:45,680
The corporate creators have great production values and everything looks shiny and nice,

362
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:49,440
and people may be distracted by that, but it ultimately doesn't change the fact that

363
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:53,760
the smaller creator with more emphasis on the actual comedy may be a lot funnier and

364
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,880
provide audiences with a lot more entertainment.

365
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:01,200
We like to think that YouTube is somewhat of an equal playing field, and although that's

366
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,360
far from the truth, it's when creators are just unconditionally pushed with no means

367
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,920
to compete that people become frustrated.

368
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,040
Understandably so.

369
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:13,760
In their first video, at a certain point, Spill shows a list of videos that were demonetised

370
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:18,480
in an attempt to show that they go through the same BS that other creators do, but none

371
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,240
of them are appealed.

372
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:24,480
That led many to believe that they might just have a separate arrangement with YouTube that

373
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:29,280
they're promoted regardless of monetisation, but I think it's a much simpler explanation.

374
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:33,440
I think that corporations just don't think sometimes about their monetisation status,

375
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,920
because corporations often don't think about that stuff.

376
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:40,000
If you've ever gone over some mainstream news channels on YouTube, many videos will

377
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,760
not have ads on them at all, and it's not because they couldn't be monetised on appeal,

378
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:47,440
it's probably because they've never appealed them, which sounds bizarre because it's a

379
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:51,760
lot of monetary difference, but for a lot of these channels it's a publicity game that

380
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:55,040
will ultimately create the most bona fide long-term income.

381
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:59,040
However, that's one of the biggest things that bothers people too about corporations,

382
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:04,080
they can withstand the demonetisation BS because they have money and investments elsewhere.

383
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:08,080
With new corporate channels taking the place of independent creators, it gives YouTube

384
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:12,400
grounds to roll out harsher demonetisation prerequisites because corporate channels couldn't

385
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,960
survive that while still being the face of the platform.

386
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:19,520
This has led to a lot of controversy, particularly on certain topics that many feel should be

387
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:23,680
open to independent commentary, and yet many of those topics are so frustrating if you

388
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:28,480
don't have that monetisation, not just on money but on views too, that it deters the

389
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,920
independent creators.

390
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:35,280
It has been researched and shown that demonetisation has a negative effect on views, and corporations

391
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,440
are a lot more resilient to that system.

392
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,960
One of the genres that have been constantly affected is drag content, in fact another

393
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:47,360
creator Jake Yonsei, I think it's Beyonce, but with Jake, he was completely demonetised,

394
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:51,360
and without community attention on it, probably would have remained demonetised too.

395
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:56,880
People perceive corporations as having a main goal of maximising monetary income, as opposed

396
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,880
to the independent creator who just wants to express themselves, and although not always

397
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:06,000
necessarily true, and although obviously not done to the most efficient extent as shown

398
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,240
by my previous comments about appeals, there are certain factors that do often cause this

399
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13,920
perspective to be somewhat accurate, emphasis on the somewhat.

400
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:17,680
The problem is that we don't want a creator's opinion to be based on the amount of money

401
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:21,600
it can make them, we want a creator's opinion to be based on what they genuinely feel at

402
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:26,800
the time, whether that feeling is popular or unpopular, well backed up or far fetched.

403
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:30,960
When they put up videos that they hadn't even appealed to the sentiment of hello fellow

404
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,960
YouTubers, it is unsettling.

405
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:38,080
Now I'm not saying that Spill is exactly stating the most monetarily popular option, or even

406
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:42,480
pandering, in fact I'd argue that they appeal less to people's reactionary emotions than

407
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,520
many other channels.

408
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:47,040
However, if they're willing to bend the truth about some of these matters for the sake of

409
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:51,600
their own reputational protection, some may say, well, what else could they be influenced

410
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,080
by?

411
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:56,400
And that's the thing about corporate involvement, vested interests, it's the same with politics,

412
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:00,160
it's the same with mainstream media, people aren't saying what they genuinely think,

413
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,240
and I understand why that bothers people.

414
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:06,720
The corporate takeover of YouTube isn't just about corporations competing with creators,

415
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:10,560
it's about how sanitized many of these creators appear because they know they're appealing

416
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:14,720
to the YouTube guidelines to gain a foot up, while still trying to maintain the masquerade

417
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,640
of relatable creator things.

418
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:21,040
This is what frustrates me because I like what Spill do, in many ways I don't have a

419
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:25,600
problem with them having ties to corporations because I know that a single person really

420
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:29,280
couldn't do what they're doing, and they are filling a gap that no one else has been

421
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:32,240
prepared to fill, which is why they're probably doing so well.

422
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:36,080
However, they have to be aware of the fact that they're in a community that values being

423
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:40,800
upfront about those ties rather than actually not having those ties, even if those ties

424
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:45,120
have some stigma, because it underlies a greater integral principle, and that's something

425
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,520
not worth betraying, even for the dollar.

426
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:51,440
But let's talk about that dollar, and how Spill are kinda messing up too.

427
00:29:55,280 --> 00:30:00,320
Spill as a channel is not working as well as it could, and I know that sounds crazy

428
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:04,000
to people because they have gained almost a million subscribers in around a year, and

429
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,240
after a year I had barely cracked a thousand, but this is one of the greater problems about

430
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:12,480
corporate channels that is overlooked because it's not exactly relevant to the content,

431
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,720
but more to the people behind it and the socio-political environment that surrounds it.

432
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:20,960
It seems sad to me that a channel with that many subscribers and views has their main

433
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:25,440
creators, the people who claim to take credit for this production, still on other jobs,

434
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,640
still claiming to struggle to make a living from time to time.

435
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:33,440
Now from the video, Roland seems like a lovely great guy, and I'm going to assume he is,

436
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,640
for the sake of the video.

437
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:39,680
But even with that noted, if he is making the money that he can and he should, then

438
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:42,800
he could be offering a lot more to his employees.

439
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:47,200
We're a small group of people without a lot of money, or the most ideal setup, space,

440
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:51,280
or tools, but we care about the quality of the work we put out, and we put all of our

441
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:54,480
effort into making sure each video is the best we've ever done.

442
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:58,960
That is a channel not functioning properly, or a channel where far too much money is going

443
00:30:58,960 --> 00:30:59,760
to the top.

444
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:03,440
Now, it could be the case that actually, the Spill voiceover and artists don't spend

445
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:07,040
too much time on the channel, but that's definitely not how they framed it, and if

446
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:10,800
they're lying, they're lying, but it also doesn't change the amount of wasted potential

447
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,840
that is occurring here.

448
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:15,920
They are not just behaving like a corporation in how they create this network of channels,

449
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:19,920
but they are behaving like a corporation in the idea that they are so distant from the

450
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:24,560
actual sources of income, they only reference it when people begin to doubt their credentials

451
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:28,960
as creators, and ultimately that's what gives me the opinion that Spill is a pretty corporate

452
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:32,960
venture, because I personally believe that if it started off as a two-person passion

453
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:37,120
project with a genuine investment, well, they would've been much more familiar with the

454
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:41,360
actual technical cogs of YouTube, and how to maximise income, because when you're a

455
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:45,600
struggling student, that sort of stuff matters to you, unless you're really complacent,

456
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:49,840
which I don't think they are, they're probably lovely people too, but I have to stress, you're

457
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:54,000
missing out on a lot right now, and you're definitely worth more than the payroll that

458
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,480
you're on at this moment in time, because people value the voice of the channel, that's

459
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:02,400
the other thing about corporations, it's just people placed here and there, and they

460
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:06,560
generate income for the person at the top who owns this idea, but that person at the top

461
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:12,000
may not necessarily be that familiar with the inner workings of YouTube channels, and it's

462
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:18,160
soulless, and can be quite inefficient. Spill barely has any alternative social media presence,

463
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:23,840
their twitter is a wasteland, they have 6,000 followers for a 930,000 subscriber channel,

464
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:28,000
and their posts are basically restricted to video publications, there's no additional

465
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,480
attempt to branch out any personality, their channel doesn't have any linked social media

466
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:36,800
accounts, they have merch I think, stickers of sorts, but they were a task to find. Looking

467
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:40,720
over their videos, I think they've only done a few sponsorships in the last 6 months,

468
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:45,840
two with Skillshare, and two with Clue, which considering their output, content, and popularity

469
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:50,640
is strikingly low, especially given how tight on money they frame themselves as. Their last

470
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:55,680
sponsorship was over 3 months ago, and since then they've uploaded almost 30 videos, sponsorships

471
00:32:55,680 --> 00:33:00,000
for a channel that size could easily equate a month's salary, they might have their reasons,

472
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,640
but it seems like a missed opportunity. How people expect these people to be in contact with YouTube

473
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:09,600
when they can't even contact Raid Shadow Legends is beyond me. I understand why I might not get

474
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:14,640
many sponsors, but I still receive offers, and Spill are much more advertiser friendly. And once

475
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:19,600
again, I stress, if this is a real personal venture of two passionate people who are invested in the

476
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:24,320
YouTube community, which I'm more than willing to take on board that it is, you gotta know how

477
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:28,960
these initiatives work, by seeing them in other creators videos, and why they would benefit you

478
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:33,440
from taking some inspiration. At the end of the day, one fact we know is that they are currently

479
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:38,480
involved in corporate business, regardless of the circumstances, and if they are, employing people,

480
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:42,720
and therefore they should want to make money not just for themselves, but for the people working

481
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:47,600
around them. These aren't just freelance individuals on one time payments, maybe a business

482
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:52,640
can afford that, but you know, a lot of employees can't, they're creating a whole universe over here,

483
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:58,000
but don't have some basics of YouTube 101 down. When corporations don't work best for the people

484
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,160
involved, it's not just a detriment to the communities they identify with, it's a detriment

485
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:06,880
to everyone who is working for them, and wasting precious opportunities to do more, and I like to

486
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:11,600
think that the person associated with the delivery of that information, and the delivery of those

487
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:16,400
opinions could make a living off that, especially when that's the appeal of the channel. I'd hate

488
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:20,960
for someone else to own my means of production, and that's just a general qualm of why I don't

489
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:24,640
like too many corporate channels, because ultimately their core is so disconnected that

490
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:29,360
even if their content is good, I wouldn't trust it on the basis of credibility alone, who is

491
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:34,080
accountable when a story is wrong. That's another important reason why people prefer transparency,

492
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:38,560
people want the right person to hold accountable, and that's especially important in a genre like

493
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:43,120
commentary. I think Spill is an interesting charm, because although they behave like a business in

494
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:47,760
many capacities, they definitely have more personality than the average corporate channel,

495
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:52,080
and I think that's what's allowed them to pass without scrutiny for such a long time.

496
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:56,720
At the same time, I can understand why this may be more threatening if businesses are now being

497
00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:01,760
able to pose as regular individuals, appealing to audiences that previously were beyond their grip,

498
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:06,720
while simultaneously pandering to YouTube's selective algorithms, while taking demonetisation

499
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:11,280
in places that many other creators could not withstand. I understand why people are worried

500
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:16,240
that eventually every genre will be orchestrated in this corporate way, and nothing that anyone

501
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:20,560
watches will be remotely real. With that said, that's also the detail that has planted a seed

502
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:23,920
of doubt in my mind about the centre of control of this channel, because someone like Taylor

503
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:28,080
Barrett must understand the amount of control that she has right now over her character,

504
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:32,320
due to that personality, to the point where it couldn't really belong to anyone else,

505
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:36,880
she's in a powerful position whether she has control of the channel or not. I could be wrong,

506
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:41,680
but she does seem to be a pretty integral element, to the point where on the unassuming surface,

507
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:46,880
their origin story made sense, it's just the details didn't quite add up beyond that.

508
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:50,880
It's why I feel it's important to tread carefully here, because although there are clearly some

509
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:55,680
disparities in their story, and honestly content that they should have been more transparent about,

510
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:59,840
they may well be happy with what they're doing and be pretty invested, because they haven't

511
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:05,120
conducted a siege on Roland, and they seem to be on good terms, that gives me some faith in their

512
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:09,600
content. However, it's important to note that they are missing out on a lot of money that could

513
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:14,320
probably help out individuals working for them, and even themselves, there does seem to be this

514
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:18,800
level of corporate disengagement in the way that they behave, and I'm sure that everyone could

515
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:24,240
benefit from some re-evaluation of that, and that's all I'm suggesting, just take a look into

516
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:29,040
it. However, this is a problem much more resonant to their actual channel, themselves, and not

517
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:34,080
exactly what other creators who are the competitors rather than the employees are concerned about,

518
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:38,080
what threat do they pose in that regard? Well, let's wrap this up.

519
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:48,560
In many ways recently YouTube has been screwing over a lot of their independent creators who

520
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:54,960
can't afford it, whether that's demonetisation, censorship, unnecessary termination, corporations

521
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:59,120
can afford it, apart from termination, though they could probably just sue YouTube at that point,

522
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:04,960
and they can circumvent it in many ways, and we know those rules impact us more than them.

523
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:09,360
I don't think Spill are a plant by YouTube themselves, I'm sure YouTube would give them much

524
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:14,000
easier treatment than the one they have allegedly been receiving, and honestly, I think a channel

525
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:19,680
like Spill would be a bit of an elaborate plan, I think it's just another company trying to get a

526
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:25,120
piece of the pie, for better and for worse. However, I don't think corporations can ever

527
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:29,840
recreate the sort of personality that an individual in front of the microphone can capture,

528
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:34,480
because it requires levels of consistency and understanding of the actual communities that

529
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:39,120
out of touch businesses filled with employees would have trouble capturing, and the fact that

530
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:44,800
Spill tried to spin their origin story in such a way originally is proof that they are not as in

531
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:49,920
touch as they like to present themselves as, and I do think audiences identify that. I don't think

532
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:54,880
corporations can ever wholly replace individual creators, fortunately because they don't have

533
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:59,680
a monopoly on the means of production in many genres, a lot of people have access to a semi-decent

534
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:04,320
microphone or camera that will enable them for content creation. That's the strange thing about

535
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:08,560
Spill, although they could be a concern in that they reflect the fact that a corporate owned

536
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:14,080
entity has more access to behave in a more human fashion, I also think that underlines their

537
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:18,480
weakness. The fact that the creation of a persona relies often so much on an individual that the

538
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:23,760
individual could then just say, well you give me more control or else I leave, seems to be an

539
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:29,120
important bargaining chip for channels that are more persona oriented. Therefore, corporations

540
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:33,040
always have to be somewhat restrained in the relationships that they create with their audience

541
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:37,360
in ways that independent creators can work around. Corporations have to make sure their ingredients

542
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:41,600
are somewhat replaceable, because if the creation of that character comes from anything unique to a

543
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:45,840
person surrounding that channel, then that person could perceptively gain more control than the

544
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:50,400
actual corporation. There's a lot of things businesses can switch in and switch out, but

545
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:55,680
persona is a tough one. Spill does great research and great formulation of content, they have neat

546
00:38:55,680 --> 00:39:00,640
animations, but that's not what audiences are looking for alone. There will always be an appeal

547
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:05,520
for people with a bit more sass, a bit more personality, a bit more edge to them, and YouTube

548
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:10,560
can pull all the algorithmic strings to give that sort of content an advantage, but I compare

549
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:15,600
YouTube's behaviours to the metaphor of taking a horse to water. They can put a load of family

550
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:21,120
friendly mediocre mainstream content on people's homepage, but that will not satisfy some. For every

551
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:27,040
Troom Troom, Bright Side, Looper, WatchMojo, there'll be a MrBeast, an iDubbbz, an I Hate Everything,

552
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:31,840
someone to represent that more organic vision of YouTube. I wouldn't say that they're all

553
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:36,320
tour de forces of personality in what they do, but the connections that they create with their

554
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:42,160
audiences are much more direct and genuine, and audiences recognise that. I think in many ways

555
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:47,840
that's what people come on YouTube for. YouTube could take away every means of support, and I

556
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:52,720
think we'd find a way to persevere, and although we should always fight for fair treatment, we

557
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:57,360
should have some confidence in our own self-sufficiency. Let's conclude this tale then. I do

558
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:01,440
think it's pretty clear that Spill weren't completely honest with how they presented themselves

559
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:06,400
in their origins, and I do understand why they wanted to downplay certain elements of their story.

560
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:11,120
You know corporation is a word with a lot of negative connotations within the YouTube community,

561
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:15,440
but all the video did was show that they were kind of out of touch with what the community

562
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:20,640
wanted. The way they utilised certain common creator struggles as ways to boost those credentials

563
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:25,040
felt surface level, and I think if they'd just provided a bit more context to their story,

564
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:29,920
people would have been okay with that. Instead it seemed like an attempt to cover up those ties,

565
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:34,800
which led to more anxiety within the community, with people wondering what ulterior motives they

566
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:40,320
had to hide it. I feel it was just a clumsy attempt to retain an image that they may not have earned,

567
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:44,640
though I understand that given the recent situation regarding YouTube's treatment of creators,

568
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:49,440
people may be a bit more on edge. And as noted, it's clear to me that Spill isn't quite as

569
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:54,240
masterful with the game as YouTube as they might appear, and are quite clunky in certain aspects

570
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:59,360
of management, which can have negative effects on their own and is completely viable for criticism.

571
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:03,680
However, with my previous points in mind, I'd also like to say that they might be running quite a

572
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:07,440
good business. The fact that the voice of the channel Taylor seems to be happily working on

573
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:11,920
the project despite having heavy negotiating power over the brand tells me that maybe they're

574
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:16,160
just doing something good for themselves and those around them. However, I'd also emphasise that

575
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:20,640
currently they do seem to be a bit out of touch, and are probably missing out on a lot of potential

576
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:25,760
income. You can all do better, and if you need any thoughts, my DMs are open. As for the effects on

577
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:29,840
the community, Spill clearly have a way of contributing positively to the discussion,

578
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:34,400
and I really do rate that. It's nice to have someone who uses citations and research to the

579
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:39,120
maximum effect, and there were a couple of instances in the past where Spill were interacting

580
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:43,280
positively with those in the community, but recently people who've been calling them out for

581
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:48,400
this escapade have been framed more antagonistically by certain followers of Spill. People have been

582
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:53,120
head-estalling them and stating that these critics are just upset they're not as good or successful,

583
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:57,760
and I don't think it's about that. As stated in this video, I think it's about that people feel

584
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:02,320
that their careers are threatened by this empty shell, and they don't have the resources to stand

585
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:07,200
up in that capacity, and it just gives YouTube more power to steamroll out harsher changes that

586
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:12,480
don't affect these large conglomerates and create this completely sanitized website. It is a worrying

587
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:16,960
thought. At the same time, I don't think Spill pertain those specific intentions, though it would

588
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:21,360
be cool if they were a bit more involved in the community. I think the alienation has built up

589
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:25,680
some disconnect between them and other creators which has probably led to this situation, and we

590
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:30,320
don't want that. I don't think audience demand for other people in the community will decrease,

591
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:34,400
and I am hopeful that YouTube will be able to recognize the contribution that independent

592
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:38,960
creators do make, and how many viewers they bring in. I think it's a principle of YouTube that they

593
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:43,120
would cripple themselves in attempting to wipe out, they wouldn't want to take that risk in my

594
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:48,240
opinion, and I don't think there's any way to fully plant corporations in the place of the individual

595
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:52,880
creator, although they have given many people rough treatment of recent, but that's also gonna

596
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:57,680
be a topic for another time. For the moment, keep making the content you love, and try and be honest

597
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:01,680
about who you are. People don't mind that much as long as you haven't spat on any docks.

598
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:08,720
So yes, that was the video, I hope you enjoyed, my lateral battery is almost dead now, and I left the

599
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:13,840
charger upstairs, so I need to get through this as quickly as possible. I want to give a big shout

600
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:18,160
out to my editors who've done a fantastic job, please go and check them out, they're beautiful

601
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:24,720
people, and I also want to give a big shout out to my Patreons, $10 Patreons are on screen right now,

602
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:32,560
$50 Patreons, somehullabaloo, Spector Angel, Rocket Ralph, Sarah Elizabeth Caroline, thank you so much,

603
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:39,040
and my $100 Patreons, Brandon, Adam Michael, and Christopher Caress, they mean a lot to me, you know,

604
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:44,560
you guys are fantastic, please keep up the great work. If you want to contact me, socials, Twitter

605
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:48,800
at The Right Opinion, Facebook The Right Official, I really need to check my DMs there actually, I probably

606
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:54,960
haven't done that for a long time, and Discord in the pinned comment, you can find all the links
