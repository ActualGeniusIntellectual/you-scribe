0	10340	Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time,
10340	15740	and who is the man behind this channel, who am I? Well, to be honest, it's not really of great importance,
15740	21680	and I'd prefer to keep my identity mostly private, although at this point it's a bit late for that, big shout out to the news website
21680	27280	who published my name. However, it doesn't have much significance in the general discussion, because I'm just one person
27320	33200	presenting what they know and what they think, and honestly, people behind respective YouTube channels aren't that important
33200	39440	in the grand scheme of things, and therefore it seems so bizarre in a way that today's situation comes across as much more
39440	46920	important to many creators than it would appear on the surface. But let's go back to the Tea community, because what's wrong with a bit of tea?
46920	55120	The Tea community has a lot of players in its complex game, firstly the large beauty creators who produce content for millions of individuals.
55120	61640	This content is fairly unproblematic on principle, but as observed, their demeanour can be quite melodramatic,
61640	67800	and there's a reason why the word melodramatic has the word drama in it. Along with drama came people with opinions on that drama,
67800	73520	and people who would look at the drama and analyse the drama. Who would have thought? You might even say that some of these channels
73520	79880	provided commentary. Now, typically the people who provided commentary were individuals with some level of proficiency
79880	86280	in the reporting of this drama. Their style may not exactly be for everyone, but they have an audience, and it seems that many of them
86280	93840	are legitimately invested in the outcome of this drama. Many of these creators are quite tabloid, and some are as dramatic as the genre they cover,
93840	100800	and honestly, that's alright, as long as people don't come to expect anything more from those channels, that's what commentary is,
100800	108400	opinion based ideas, and if you disagree with that person, that's okay too. However, at the same time, some people may want a more in-depth
108440	115280	perspective on YouTube drama. A lot of commentators aren't the most involved in that, and that's perfectly normal too, not everyone has the time
115280	122200	to sit down for a 30 minute summary of something that really isn't the most consequential in their life. Nonetheless, there is a demand,
122200	128800	and that demand exists in every genre, so as natural within the beauty community, eventually a channel would emerge with a bit more focus
128800	135920	on creating long-form content that focuses on the delivery and the depth of the information rather than merely the gut reaction to it.
136000	142320	The channel that appeared to answer these prayers was a creator by the name of Spill. Like the fairly simplistic name, their content never
142320	149360	assumes too much about the subjects that they're covering, and focuses more on the delivery of this information in a journalistic and well-cited way,
149360	156800	with the conclusions often being well informed and providing some sort of additional insight. They started their channel on the 5th of September 2018,
156800	164160	and in the following year have accumulated a pretty healthy 930,000 subscribers. They often receive praise from many audiences and creators
164160	170720	who were representing information in an unbiased and thorough fashion. Spill also appeared to be creating this more deeply rooted nexus,
170720	178800	which is our word of the day by the way. This was represented by three additional channels, Brew, Grill, and On The Hill, which all have their own dynamic,
178800	187520	they were good at what they did. However, perhaps a little too good. In the last couple months, suspicions have been aroused regarding Spill's existence,
187520	195120	and if everything is as you would typically assume it would be. What do I mean? Well, as said, many people have expectations for these channels,
195120	202560	and commentary channels are typically expected to be a bit more personal, because it's hard to exactly represent opinions of a corporation.
202560	209280	With that said, Spill walked the line of actual opinions, and now estrayed too far from the safety of what they could present as actual evidence.
209280	217120	However, some felt that their content, although of good quality, was not what should be representing a community, for reasons that we will debate in due time.
217200	224480	A few YouTubers, including D'Angelo and Petty Page published videos where they expressed concerns regarding Spill's channel origins,
224480	230800	and the idea that they actually represented this corporatisation of even YouTube's most independent genres.
230800	238800	Their sanitary, family-friendly nature was somewhat discomforting, and people then began to create further hypotheses about the nature of their existence.
238800	244000	Were they being planted by YouTube themselves to deal with these pesky independent creators?
244000	249600	Or to create the perception that YouTube is just this squeaky clean platform for advertisers, or the media?
249600	256080	Given their incredible growth, it was an unsettling thought, and this led many to theorise about the origins of such a channel.
256080	261440	Paired with the demonetisation and censorship that has been vented by frustrated creators within this community,
261440	265200	this led many to believe that there may be a greater agenda at stake.
265200	270960	However, with all the uncertainty swelling, Spill decided to explain their origins in a video themselves.
271040	274080	Spill started out as a two-person passion project.
274080	279120	One of us has a background in journalism, the other has a background in illustration and video editing.
279120	282160	We both love YouTube news and drama. Who doesn't?
282160	286480	We wanted to create a channel that had a more journalistic approach to YouTube drama,
286480	290560	a thorough recap of all sides of a story, with proper citations.
290560	293760	On top of that, we wanted to give something back to the community,
293760	297120	by contributing to the conversation with an educational approach.
297200	301280	Keeping tabs on celebrities and influencers is something many of us like to do.
301280	307760	It's a guilty pleasure, but it can get toxic, so that's why we discussed the big issues and opened the conversation.
307760	311840	In this video, they state that Spill originated as a two-person passion project,
311840	315280	which is more focused on presenting drama from a neutral perspective.
315280	320320	This meant that often when covering these topics, given the immense workload they would have to go through to create this,
320320	324560	when they realised that they were actually ascertaining a significant level of success,
324560	328240	they decided that more people would be necessary to help expand on this project,
328240	332720	and eventually this led to their own side projects, including Brew, Grill, and On The Hill.
332720	337040	Ultimately, the core principle that they started off believing in still stood true,
337040	341280	their commitment to delivering content from those principles had not changed.
341280	343840	They note that they have incorporated themselves,
343840	347040	however this was only from the perspective that they would have a lot of people,
347040	350400	and that it was easier to incorporate themselves for tax purposes.
350400	355520	It initially started as a side project, but once Spill started to grow, the team grew too.
355520	359360	This way, we can put out more high-quality videos at a faster pace.
359360	362880	But at the end of the day, we're still individual content creators,
362880	366560	who love what we do and are proud of the work we put into our videos.
366560	370160	As soon as more than one person is working on a big project together,
370160	373600	it's legally the best option to register as a corporation.
373600	376480	In Canada, there are three types of business structures.
376480	379520	Sole Proprietorship, Partnership, and Corporation.
379520	384240	A Sole Proprietorship is an unincorporated business owned by one person, like a graphic
384240	389200	designer. A Partnership is a joint relationship between two or more individuals working on a
389200	393760	business together, but each person is personally responsible for profits and losses.
393760	399040	The final option, the Corporation, tends to be the best option for teams of more than one person
399040	403600	because, among other reasons, it offers limited risk for the owners of the company.
403600	406960	Basically, you're only on the hook for what you invest in the company,
406960	409600	rather than everything you own as an individual.
409600	412720	So for many self-employed people or small businesses,
412720	415440	it makes more sense to incorporate for tax reasons.
415440	418960	They provide a few sources that justify their reasoning, and state they have no
418960	422160	contacts at YouTube, and there's no evidence to disprove this.
422160	426560	It all seems very reasonable on the surface, and in a regular, surface-level world,
426560	429040	we would be able to continue with our daily lives.
429040	432880	But behind the scenes, something was brewing, and it wasn't just tea.
432880	436800	Join me today as I tell you an interesting little story about a child that wasn't quite
436800	440800	as crystal clear as they could have been, and exactly why that might have been,
440800	442560	and if it even matters at all.
442560	446000	But I wouldn't begin to make such a video if it didn't matter, would I?
446800	449280	Well, there's only one way to find out.
449280	450160	Let us begin.
456800	461040	On the surface, it seems bizarre that someone would not be entirely honest about their channel's
461040	463920	origin unless they were money laundering or something.
463920	467520	So you'd really need the evidence that things aren't as they seem.
467520	471600	However, one of the people I mentioned earlier, Petty Page, released another video rebutting
471600	475200	this reveal video, and presenting some interesting information herself.
475200	479680	In her video, she outlines how in fact the corporation that Spill appears to be registered
479680	485920	under is not their own, but in fact another corporation named AWED, whose existence seems
485920	488560	to have been conceived around 2013.
488560	491280	This evidence can be found on the Canadian website.
491280	495120	What makes Petty think that this specific corporation is the one in charge of Spill?
495120	498960	Well, there is a lot of considerable evidence relating to the employees, and most notably
498960	502240	those who have themselves as working for both Spill and AWED.
502800	506880	Arguably the most incriminating factor was the fact that the voice of Spill, a person
506880	510720	named Taylor Barrett, had Spill listed under AWED Corp.
510720	515280	There was also some pretty compelling circumstantial observations, such as the fact that in the
515280	519680	time that Brew was set up, there was a decrease in posting on other AWED owned sites, such
519680	522080	as GoodGood and their relative Facebook pages.
522080	524560	That energy must have been going into something.
524560	528000	However, that didn't necessarily prove that AWED set up the channel.
528000	532000	A few months ago, I covered a situation regarding Smosh, and how they were bought out by another
532000	532560	network.
532560	536320	If that was the case, why did they claim in their video that they had incorporated themselves
536320	539920	with emphasis on tax perspectives, rather than just saying they had contracted with
539920	541520	the larger corporation?
541520	545360	The corporation that Spill is listed under is called AWED Corp.
545360	550640	Now, I looked online and found out that AWED Corp became incorporated in 2013.
550640	555360	I even paid the Canadian government to get AWED Corp's Certificate of Incorporation,
555360	560800	meaning that the person behind Spill, Taylor, would have been 17-18 years old when it became
560800	564320	a corporation, so something wasn't adding up.
564320	567680	On top of this, the fact that the two people who were alleged to have founded the channel
567680	572320	were still working side jobs to suffice income, on a channel that could prospectively be making
572320	576640	hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, told people that it had to be some main beneficiary,
576640	578800	because it really didn't make sense otherwise.
578800	582960	And I'm not one to overstate the potential right now, but these people are throwing money
582960	585120	away, but we'll get to that in a bit.
586000	591280	Regardless of outcome, whether AWED had involved themselves prior or after, many believed this
591280	595680	would still go against the general tone of their video, which framed them as being rather
595680	597280	in control of their channels.
597840	602800	Canadian small businesses who want limited risk need to register as a corporation.
602800	605760	And we aren't the only YouTubers to be incorporated.
605760	611840	Many other individual creators and small teams are registered as either corporations or LLCs,
611840	616960	like Shane Dawson, Simply Nailogical, The Try Guys, and Philip DeFranco.
616960	620560	So you can see, registering as a corporation is complicated.
620560	623520	You may be thinking, that all sounds really boring.
623520	626080	Well, the truth is, it is.
626080	628640	Legal stuff is boring, even for me.
628640	629680	Even for you?
629680	632160	Are you the one who did the legal work to incorporate?
632160	636960	It doesn't seem like it, and I really wanted to give Spill the benefit of the doubt.
636960	639360	But this isn't mutually ambiguous language.
639360	643200	If you watched the original video, you received the impression that they, as individuals,
643200	647920	started the channel and then incorporated it afterwards, themselves, something that just
647920	648960	isn't true.
648960	650640	But it wasn't quite over.
650720	655680	You see, Spill responded, in a second video which was much more comprehensive, they open
655680	660400	up stating that they did not feel the details they had left out of their original video
660400	664960	were completely relevant to the Spill story, and honestly, this video does clear up a fair
664960	669280	few things, but at the same time, I think it's right to take a few issues.
669280	674400	They follow their intro by showing us a man known as Roland, or as Spill refers to him
674400	679680	as the man who made this all possible, what happens next is an inspiring rags to riches
679680	680080	story.
709680	730480	I mean, it's very lovely to hear, but it doesn't really change much.
730480	735200	Although privilege does pervade the upper echelons of many industries, there are many
735200	737440	people with rags to riches stories as well.
737440	742480	It doesn't necessarily make you a great person, but good for you at least, I hated
742480	745760	having bosses too, but it doesn't make a company less corporate.
745760	750080	It's good to know there's a human at the centre, but that's also why it can be a problem,
750080	751520	and I'll discuss that later.
751520	756640	With all that in mind, it's a pretty inspiring story if it is sincere, and I'm happy that
756640	761200	Spill has provided Roland with levels of success, but let's get back to the grit.
761840	766480	Throughout the video, there is this tone that kind of tries to undercut the notion of incorporating,
766480	770640	as this fairly normal, regular thing, and it feels like they're trying to combat the
770640	774080	negative stigma that comes with the process of incorporation.
774080	778640	The three of them were sure they would outshine Reddit, so Roland incorporated Favorize.
778640	782000	We incorporated Favorize because we thought it was gonna be the next big thing, so why
782000	784160	wait, let's just do it right away.
784160	788080	We were a team of three, obviously like as a partner, you know, with partners you have
788080	792480	to make sure that everything is disclosed, so we did it at incorporation.
792480	795840	I actually don't think there's a problem with incorporating.
795840	798160	If you wanna do that, fine by me.
798160	802720	But I think the problem is, and Spill knows this, that how people define corporation-run
802720	807040	channels is very different to a channel that has been started up by an individual slash
807040	812240	individuals and incorporated after, otherwise they wouldn't have framed it as the latter
812240	815280	in the original video when it clearly wasn't the case.
815280	820000	And while a lot of people choose to do creative projects while being self-employed, as soon
820000	824720	as more than one person is working on a big project together, it's legally the best option
824720	826640	to register as a corporation.
826640	831440	In Canada, there are three types of business structures, sole proprietorship, partnership,
831440	832560	and corporation.
832560	837280	A sole proprietorship is an unincorporated business owned by one person, like a graphic
837280	837920	designer.
837920	842640	A partnership is a joint relationship between two or more individuals working on a business
842640	846800	together, but each person is personally responsible for profits and losses.
846800	851280	The final option, the corporation, tends to be the best option for teams of more than
851280	856000	one person because, among other reasons, it offers limited risk for the owners of the
856000	856640	company.
856640	860960	Basically, you're only on the hook for what you invest in the company rather than everything
860960	862640	you own as an individual.
862640	867360	So for many self-employed people or small businesses, it makes more sense to incorporate
867360	868320	for tax reasons.
869280	873760	This is something that I would say was still dishonest, even with the new information.
873760	876560	That's what was relevant to be upfront about.
876560	881200	I'll discuss why this distinction is important and how Spill does fall into these traps for
881200	885040	very soon, but Spill's video is a nice story for the origins of a channel.
885040	889840	However, it is mostly about Roland, who as a person, I never had an issue with.
889840	894480	I'd rather have a channel like Spill than most, but it doesn't mean that I can't take
894480	898560	a fair few problems with their dealings and how they represented those dealings.
899520	904160	You can say that the information wasn't viewed as relevant to you, but the fact remains that
904160	908480	it wasn't really a case of additional information that doesn't change the context of your channel
908480	908880	at all.
908880	913440	The additional information here does change the context, but being the smart creators
913440	918080	they are, Bill or Roland knew how to embed it in such a load of additional information
918080	922080	that honestly wasn't the most relevant, you kinda just forget that they even implied a
922080	924240	different story in the first place.
924240	928480	It's the polar opposite of going from not enough information to too much information,
928480	932000	but honestly, I'd rather have too much than not enough, because at least people with a
932000	934640	critical eye can extract the information that they need.
935280	940800	So you can see, Spill and all our other projects were self-made and started from scratch.
940800	944320	There was a lot of experimenting before we got to where we are today.
944320	948960	So by the end of this story, I became quite confused by this comment, because sure, they've
948960	954160	definitely put to bed some of the more out there ideas that they were funded by YouTube,
954160	958640	which were on the more conspiratorial side, and I personally wasn't persuaded by them
958640	962880	for reasons that I'll state later, but if you're going to go into depth about all the
962880	966800	processes that led up to the creation of the channel and the company behind it, to
966800	971760	suddenly say, see, it was made from scratch guys, seems rather defensive in a tonal shift
971760	973440	that hasn't really been earned.
973440	978720	Before this video, I totally accounted for this being a situation, being a possibility,
978720	982640	and although I will defend them on some behalfs, I also feel like they're trying to dance
982640	987600	out of some untruths and avoid being the centre of a discussion that is quite important.
987600	988880	What is that discussion?
988880	990240	Well, let's go there now.
993680	998160	After some deep thought, I really can't buy the fact that they omitted certain details
998160	1000240	because they didn't believe it was relevant.
1000240	1005120	Obviously, we have the real elephant in the room that was the misleading notion of incorporation.
1005120	1008720	I don't want to go into too much more detail about that, because hopefully it's quite
1008720	1014080	self explanatory at this point where the contradiction comes, but also the framing of a two person
1014080	1017440	passion project did irk some people.
1017440	1021600	Now if what they're saying is true, the people working on this project certainly had an interest
1021600	1026000	in the topic themselves, but once again that doesn't necessarily undermine all the points
1026000	1027040	being made against them.
1027040	1030560	I would say that they certainly have more character than many of the corporate channels,
1030560	1034560	and to completely say they're the same would be unreasonable, but I'd also argue that there
1034560	1038720	is an element of corporate cluelessness that pervades what they do sometimes.
1038720	1043280	People's concerns about corporations is that given their pre-existing status as a business,
1043280	1047840	they may obtain unfair advantages, and lack the genuine investment in what they're doing,
1047840	1052400	and thus lead to takes that aren't in completely good faith, or partially had that, and I'm
1052400	1056960	going to go through all of these factors in this video, but I want to start by focusing
1056960	1058320	on their foundation.
1058320	1063280	As Roland explained earlier, everything started with one person and no outside help.
1063280	1068880	We had no financial support then, and we don't have financial support now, and yes, demonetisation
1068880	1070160	affects us a lot.
1070160	1074080	We make just enough to run the company and slowly grow the Spill Universe.
1074080	1078560	Whether you would consider Spill's channel made from quote scratch, I personally don't
1078560	1083840	know many YouTubers who started their channel on the back of a business specifically committed
1083840	1086720	to that channel with a salary already supporting them.
1086720	1089040	That is definitely the design of a company.
1089040	1093360	For many people, they start making content because they're interested in a topic, even
1093360	1097120	with the personal interests of the individuals in the video noted.
1097120	1101920	The story that Spill tells us, as genuinely told, it is still one of sourcing a channel
1101920	1104560	for the purpose of greater company-based interest.
1104560	1108240	They obviously frame it very earnestly, talking about employee morale.
1108240	1126240	And although I respect that, I feel that there has been a bit of sugar coating in the motives
1126240	1130640	here, particularly given in the previous video they had spoken about Spill as if it was the
1130640	1134880	main controlling factor, which seems to be no longer true, and obviously to take into
1134880	1138960	consideration the fact that other Ord pages weren't the most successful at the point
1138960	1141280	of those other channels starting up either.
1141280	1145120	And I'll talk about that in a bit, but I feel that their story is still rooted in the
1145120	1145760	industry.
1145760	1150560	When people see that, I can understand the concern, and their behaviour hasn't exactly
1150560	1153440	embraced the from scratch approach.
1153440	1158160	The individual at the top of Ord, our good friend Roland Umarin, seems to have a history
1158160	1159600	of running these sorts of businesses.
1159600	1164240	He has multiple businesses to do with networking and presentation set up in the past, and it's
1164240	1168960	understandable why someone would want to include his expertise, although some have been more
1168960	1172880	successful than others, but alas, that is the business life after all.
1172880	1177520	I personally felt that whatever had happened, the current set up was quite reflective of
1177520	1181760	corporate involvement, rather than the two person passion project.
1181760	1185440	In fact, in many ways they were behaving exactly like a corporation.
1185440	1189360	What many of these businesses do, including Ord's good good friend, is that they have
1189360	1193040	one successful page or channel, and then begin to extend that brand.
1193040	1195440	That is something they even cover in the video.
1195440	1199920	In good good's instance, they would just stick a new suffix on the end to outline what topic
1199920	1205360	they would be covering, good good food, good good gifts, good good dildos, I don't know.
1205360	1209920	What they're doing in this bill universe is much of the same, creating these new brands
1209920	1212320	that are different, but also the same.
1212320	1218160	Same style, same approach, same cross promotion, and even the same ballpark of personality,
1218160	1222080	as they let that hot beverage brew up, and talk about the topic that they just can't
1222080	1222880	get enough of.
1223520	1226240	There's something somewhat unsettling about it to be honest.
1226240	1230560	With that noted, it does seem that Grill is slightly different in his approach, though
1230560	1232720	honestly, I'm not sure if I like it.
1242800	1246960	I personally don't really see the appeal, though it does give me an insight into what
1247040	1250240	roast content would be like if it was done by a Canadian.
1250240	1254720	However, I am sure though, I definitely dislike On The Hill, which seems to be the sort of
1254720	1259200	thing that a corporation would undoubtedly greenlight and produce.
1272480	1276480	They're not doing themselves any favours, I mean, that voice acting.
1276960	1282640	Hello fellow YouTubers, I do YouTube, my parents do not want me to do YouTube, I am defying
1282640	1287520	my parents, I am definitely a three dimensional fleshed out character, did I mention I want
1287520	1288640	to be a YouTuber?
1289280	1291600	Please help me, please.
1291600	1297200	Also, I really despise, strong word I know, how all the characters resemble pop vinyls.
1297200	1301520	Pop vinyls are bad and emotionless enough as they are, they're even less effective when
1301520	1306560	you try to actually give them personalities that contrast with that vacuum of a face.
1306560	1311360	I'm going off piece here, but what I mean is that it all seems to me in its current
1311360	1315760	form to be a bit too corporate for my liking, and I'll go into more detail about that
1315760	1316260	in a bit.
1316880	1321760	Now, of course, it is possible that that behaviour has developed from the individuals working
1321760	1326080	with the corporation, and their experience has taught them how to develop such a network,
1326080	1330160	but even then that doesn't really counteract the other points that have been brought up,
1330160	1334480	and at best they've omitted information to paint a misleading image of their business,
1334480	1339680	at worst they've actively lied, but that's why we should move to our next few questions.
1339680	1340880	Why would they?
1340880	1343840	Would anyone have cared if they were a corporation?
1344480	1347920	Would anyone have cared if they were working for a corporation?
1347920	1349360	Should anyone have cared?
1349360	1353360	Well, these are all interesting questions, and I want to talk about all of them too.
1355840	1359680	I'm going to play you a clip that was found in research for another video that isn't happening
1359680	1361280	now, which is a great shame.
1361280	1365520	It's unfair to even consider T-Series a big YouTuber, and this has been a huge problem
1365520	1369680	on YouTube for so long, corporations and businesses essentially taking over YouTube.
1369680	1373040	I don't think there's anything inherently wrong with businesses being on YouTube.
1373040	1374000	It's smart.
1374000	1375920	YouTube is a huge platform.
1375920	1377920	Why not take advantage of its insane reach?
1378720	1382800	Plus, as a fan of TV shows, I really like being able to rewatch interviews, sketches,
1382800	1385280	and performances after the show airs.
1385280	1389440	That being said, the increasing presence of major corporations forces out independent
1389440	1392240	creators, the people who made YouTube what it is today.
1392240	1395920	This has become increasingly stressful for independent creators because they can't keep
1395920	1396800	up with YouTube.
1396800	1400400	That's why we've been seeing more and more YouTubers leaving or going on a break.
1400400	1401520	They're burnt out.
1401520	1403360	And that's not the only discouraging thing.
1403360	1404960	Take a scroll through the trending page.
1404960	1408320	The majority of it is late night shows, companies, and music videos.
1408320	1411360	And have you noticed celebrities are taking over the platform too?
1411360	1412480	It's so smart.
1412480	1416240	Corporations know we love celebrities, so they make stars seem more accessible to us
1416240	1417680	by putting them on YouTube.
1417680	1420640	But in reality, there's a huge production team behind it.
1420640	1425040	So you can see, T-Series taking over as a top YouTube channel is really more symbolic
1425040	1428800	of how YouTube has become more corporation friendly, hurting the independent creators
1428800	1430000	who made it big.
1430000	1434000	It's not hard to be somewhat amused at the irony of such a statement, and honestly, I
1434000	1436720	feel that this is one of the key problems straight out the gate.
1436720	1441520	As said, on principle, bar exceptional circumstances, it doesn't matter the foundations that I
1441520	1445120	founded this channel on, it's the journey that has led me here today, and I'd hoped
1445120	1448000	that people would be able to judge me on the basis of that.
1448000	1452880	But if I was to make a story about my origins, and I left out certain details that were kinda
1452880	1456960	important, and it painted a picture that was very different to the one that was the actual
1456960	1460480	case, then I think people would have reason to feel misled or annoyed.
1461040	1465920	However, it does go deeper than that, because when we create a channel often based off our
1465920	1470560	own personality, we do create a connection, and as a principle, as a case of morality
1470560	1475680	here, I would expect people to create connections of genuine information, of genuine beliefs.
1475680	1480000	Now there is a stigma around corporations, which we'll discuss in a moment, but I would
1480000	1484400	have rather still make it clear what the picture resembles first time round rather than being
1484400	1489600	selected with the information that they presented, especially their channel which prides themselves
1489600	1491680	on presenting all sides.
1491680	1495520	As a principle, being straight with your audience about such information will follow through
1495520	1500000	into statements on general integrity as they are underlined by the same principles.
1500080	1503600	It's clear to me that Spill were aware of the problems that presenting themselves as
1503600	1508640	more corporate than many assume may have brought, but with that said, I can understand why they
1508640	1511920	may have been hesitant to be forthcoming about that information.
1511920	1515280	Nonetheless, people are persistent twats, and whether you tell them or not, they're
1515280	1516800	gonna find out for themselves.
1516800	1518160	So what are the problems?
1518960	1523120	Obviously, there has been a narrative of recent that corporations are taking over YouTube,
1523120	1525520	and that has caused concern within many communities.
1525520	1529840	In certain communities, creators have been completely ejected by the big machine, with
1529840	1534800	YouTube channels like Jimmy Kimmel Live basically monopolising the YouTube homepage, and pushing
1534800	1539120	out more independent creators whose content may be less wholesome or family friendly,
1539120	1541360	but no less quality in its content.
1541360	1545680	The corporate creators have great production values and everything looks shiny and nice,
1545680	1549440	and people may be distracted by that, but it ultimately doesn't change the fact that
1549440	1553760	the smaller creator with more emphasis on the actual comedy may be a lot funnier and
1553760	1556880	provide audiences with a lot more entertainment.
1556880	1561200	We like to think that YouTube is somewhat of an equal playing field, and although that's
1561200	1565360	far from the truth, it's when creators are just unconditionally pushed with no means
1565360	1567920	to compete that people become frustrated.
1567920	1569040	Understandably so.
1569040	1573760	In their first video, at a certain point, Spill shows a list of videos that were demonetised
1573760	1578480	in an attempt to show that they go through the same BS that other creators do, but none
1578480	1580240	of them are appealed.
1580320	1584480	That led many to believe that they might just have a separate arrangement with YouTube that
1584480	1589280	they're promoted regardless of monetisation, but I think it's a much simpler explanation.
1589280	1593440	I think that corporations just don't think sometimes about their monetisation status,
1593440	1595920	because corporations often don't think about that stuff.
1595920	1600000	If you've ever gone over some mainstream news channels on YouTube, many videos will
1600000	1603760	not have ads on them at all, and it's not because they couldn't be monetised on appeal,
1603760	1607440	it's probably because they've never appealed them, which sounds bizarre because it's a
1607440	1611760	lot of monetary difference, but for a lot of these channels it's a publicity game that
1611760	1615040	will ultimately create the most bona fide long-term income.
1615040	1619040	However, that's one of the biggest things that bothers people too about corporations,
1619040	1624080	they can withstand the demonetisation BS because they have money and investments elsewhere.
1624080	1628080	With new corporate channels taking the place of independent creators, it gives YouTube
1628080	1632400	grounds to roll out harsher demonetisation prerequisites because corporate channels couldn't
1632400	1634960	survive that while still being the face of the platform.
1634960	1639520	This has led to a lot of controversy, particularly on certain topics that many feel should be
1639520	1643680	open to independent commentary, and yet many of those topics are so frustrating if you
1643680	1648480	don't have that monetisation, not just on money but on views too, that it deters the
1648480	1649920	independent creators.
1649920	1655280	It has been researched and shown that demonetisation has a negative effect on views, and corporations
1655280	1657440	are a lot more resilient to that system.
1657440	1660960	One of the genres that have been constantly affected is drag content, in fact another
1660960	1667360	creator Jake Yonsei, I think it's Beyonce, but with Jake, he was completely demonetised,
1667360	1671360	and without community attention on it, probably would have remained demonetised too.
1671360	1676880	People perceive corporations as having a main goal of maximising monetary income, as opposed
1676880	1680880	to the independent creator who just wants to express themselves, and although not always
1680880	1686000	necessarily true, and although obviously not done to the most efficient extent as shown
1686000	1690240	by my previous comments about appeals, there are certain factors that do often cause this
1690240	1693920	perspective to be somewhat accurate, emphasis on the somewhat.
1693920	1697680	The problem is that we don't want a creator's opinion to be based on the amount of money
1697680	1701600	it can make them, we want a creator's opinion to be based on what they genuinely feel at
1701600	1706800	the time, whether that feeling is popular or unpopular, well backed up or far fetched.
1706800	1710960	When they put up videos that they hadn't even appealed to the sentiment of hello fellow
1710960	1712960	YouTubers, it is unsettling.
1712960	1718080	Now I'm not saying that Spill is exactly stating the most monetarily popular option, or even
1718080	1722480	pandering, in fact I'd argue that they appeal less to people's reactionary emotions than
1722480	1723520	many other channels.
1723520	1727040	However, if they're willing to bend the truth about some of these matters for the sake of
1727040	1731600	their own reputational protection, some may say, well, what else could they be influenced
1731600	1732080	by?
1732080	1736400	And that's the thing about corporate involvement, vested interests, it's the same with politics,
1736400	1740160	it's the same with mainstream media, people aren't saying what they genuinely think,
1740160	1742240	and I understand why that bothers people.
1742240	1746720	The corporate takeover of YouTube isn't just about corporations competing with creators,
1746720	1750560	it's about how sanitized many of these creators appear because they know they're appealing
1750560	1754720	to the YouTube guidelines to gain a foot up, while still trying to maintain the masquerade
1754720	1756640	of relatable creator things.
1756640	1761040	This is what frustrates me because I like what Spill do, in many ways I don't have a
1761040	1765600	problem with them having ties to corporations because I know that a single person really
1765600	1769280	couldn't do what they're doing, and they are filling a gap that no one else has been
1769280	1772240	prepared to fill, which is why they're probably doing so well.
1772240	1776080	However, they have to be aware of the fact that they're in a community that values being
1776080	1780800	upfront about those ties rather than actually not having those ties, even if those ties
1780800	1785120	have some stigma, because it underlies a greater integral principle, and that's something
1785120	1787520	not worth betraying, even for the dollar.
1787520	1791440	But let's talk about that dollar, and how Spill are kinda messing up too.
1795280	1800320	Spill as a channel is not working as well as it could, and I know that sounds crazy
1800320	1804000	to people because they have gained almost a million subscribers in around a year, and
1804000	1808240	after a year I had barely cracked a thousand, but this is one of the greater problems about
1808240	1812480	corporate channels that is overlooked because it's not exactly relevant to the content,
1812480	1816720	but more to the people behind it and the socio-political environment that surrounds it.
1816720	1820960	It seems sad to me that a channel with that many subscribers and views has their main
1820960	1825440	creators, the people who claim to take credit for this production, still on other jobs,
1825440	1828640	still claiming to struggle to make a living from time to time.
1828640	1833440	Now from the video, Roland seems like a lovely great guy, and I'm going to assume he is,
1833440	1834640	for the sake of the video.
1834640	1839680	But even with that noted, if he is making the money that he can and he should, then
1839680	1842800	he could be offering a lot more to his employees.
1842800	1847200	We're a small group of people without a lot of money, or the most ideal setup, space,
1847200	1851280	or tools, but we care about the quality of the work we put out, and we put all of our
1851280	1854480	effort into making sure each video is the best we've ever done.
1854480	1858960	That is a channel not functioning properly, or a channel where far too much money is going
1858960	1859760	to the top.
1859760	1863440	Now, it could be the case that actually, the Spill voiceover and artists don't spend
1863440	1867040	too much time on the channel, but that's definitely not how they framed it, and if
1867040	1870800	they're lying, they're lying, but it also doesn't change the amount of wasted potential
1870800	1871840	that is occurring here.
1871840	1875920	They are not just behaving like a corporation in how they create this network of channels,
1875920	1879920	but they are behaving like a corporation in the idea that they are so distant from the
1879920	1884560	actual sources of income, they only reference it when people begin to doubt their credentials
1884560	1888960	as creators, and ultimately that's what gives me the opinion that Spill is a pretty corporate
1888960	1892960	venture, because I personally believe that if it started off as a two-person passion
1892960	1897120	project with a genuine investment, well, they would've been much more familiar with the
1897120	1901360	actual technical cogs of YouTube, and how to maximise income, because when you're a
1901360	1905600	struggling student, that sort of stuff matters to you, unless you're really complacent,
1905600	1909840	which I don't think they are, they're probably lovely people too, but I have to stress, you're
1909840	1914000	missing out on a lot right now, and you're definitely worth more than the payroll that
1914000	1918480	you're on at this moment in time, because people value the voice of the channel, that's
1918560	1922400	the other thing about corporations, it's just people placed here and there, and they
1922400	1926560	generate income for the person at the top who owns this idea, but that person at the top
1926560	1932000	may not necessarily be that familiar with the inner workings of YouTube channels, and it's
1932000	1938160	soulless, and can be quite inefficient. Spill barely has any alternative social media presence,
1938160	1943840	their twitter is a wasteland, they have 6,000 followers for a 930,000 subscriber channel,
1943840	1948000	and their posts are basically restricted to video publications, there's no additional
1948000	1952480	attempt to branch out any personality, their channel doesn't have any linked social media
1952480	1956800	accounts, they have merch I think, stickers of sorts, but they were a task to find. Looking
1956800	1960720	over their videos, I think they've only done a few sponsorships in the last 6 months,
1960720	1965840	two with Skillshare, and two with Clue, which considering their output, content, and popularity
1965840	1970640	is strikingly low, especially given how tight on money they frame themselves as. Their last
1970640	1975680	sponsorship was over 3 months ago, and since then they've uploaded almost 30 videos, sponsorships
1975680	1980000	for a channel that size could easily equate a month's salary, they might have their reasons,
1980000	1984640	but it seems like a missed opportunity. How people expect these people to be in contact with YouTube
1984640	1989600	when they can't even contact Raid Shadow Legends is beyond me. I understand why I might not get
1989600	1994640	many sponsors, but I still receive offers, and Spill are much more advertiser friendly. And once
1994640	1999600	again, I stress, if this is a real personal venture of two passionate people who are invested in the
1999600	2004320	YouTube community, which I'm more than willing to take on board that it is, you gotta know how
2004320	2008960	these initiatives work, by seeing them in other creators videos, and why they would benefit you
2008960	2013440	from taking some inspiration. At the end of the day, one fact we know is that they are currently
2013440	2018480	involved in corporate business, regardless of the circumstances, and if they are, employing people,
2018480	2022720	and therefore they should want to make money not just for themselves, but for the people working
2022720	2027600	around them. These aren't just freelance individuals on one time payments, maybe a business
2027600	2032640	can afford that, but you know, a lot of employees can't, they're creating a whole universe over here,
2032640	2038000	but don't have some basics of YouTube 101 down. When corporations don't work best for the people
2038000	2042160	involved, it's not just a detriment to the communities they identify with, it's a detriment
2042160	2046880	to everyone who is working for them, and wasting precious opportunities to do more, and I like to
2046880	2051600	think that the person associated with the delivery of that information, and the delivery of those
2051600	2056400	opinions could make a living off that, especially when that's the appeal of the channel. I'd hate
2056400	2060960	for someone else to own my means of production, and that's just a general qualm of why I don't
2060960	2064640	like too many corporate channels, because ultimately their core is so disconnected that
2064640	2069360	even if their content is good, I wouldn't trust it on the basis of credibility alone, who is
2069360	2074080	accountable when a story is wrong. That's another important reason why people prefer transparency,
2074080	2078560	people want the right person to hold accountable, and that's especially important in a genre like
2078560	2083120	commentary. I think Spill is an interesting charm, because although they behave like a business in
2083120	2087760	many capacities, they definitely have more personality than the average corporate channel,
2087760	2092080	and I think that's what's allowed them to pass without scrutiny for such a long time.
2092080	2096720	At the same time, I can understand why this may be more threatening if businesses are now being
2096720	2101760	able to pose as regular individuals, appealing to audiences that previously were beyond their grip,
2101760	2106720	while simultaneously pandering to YouTube's selective algorithms, while taking demonetisation
2106720	2111280	in places that many other creators could not withstand. I understand why people are worried
2111280	2116240	that eventually every genre will be orchestrated in this corporate way, and nothing that anyone
2116240	2120560	watches will be remotely real. With that said, that's also the detail that has planted a seed
2120560	2123920	of doubt in my mind about the centre of control of this channel, because someone like Taylor
2123920	2128080	Barrett must understand the amount of control that she has right now over her character,
2128080	2132320	due to that personality, to the point where it couldn't really belong to anyone else,
2132320	2136880	she's in a powerful position whether she has control of the channel or not. I could be wrong,
2136880	2141680	but she does seem to be a pretty integral element, to the point where on the unassuming surface,
2141760	2146880	their origin story made sense, it's just the details didn't quite add up beyond that.
2146880	2150880	It's why I feel it's important to tread carefully here, because although there are clearly some
2150880	2155680	disparities in their story, and honestly content that they should have been more transparent about,
2155680	2159840	they may well be happy with what they're doing and be pretty invested, because they haven't
2159840	2165120	conducted a siege on Roland, and they seem to be on good terms, that gives me some faith in their
2165120	2169600	content. However, it's important to note that they are missing out on a lot of money that could
2169600	2174320	probably help out individuals working for them, and even themselves, there does seem to be this
2174320	2178800	level of corporate disengagement in the way that they behave, and I'm sure that everyone could
2178800	2184240	benefit from some re-evaluation of that, and that's all I'm suggesting, just take a look into
2184240	2189040	it. However, this is a problem much more resonant to their actual channel, themselves, and not
2189040	2194080	exactly what other creators who are the competitors rather than the employees are concerned about,
2194080	2198080	what threat do they pose in that regard? Well, let's wrap this up.
2204480	2208560	In many ways recently YouTube has been screwing over a lot of their independent creators who
2208560	2214960	can't afford it, whether that's demonetisation, censorship, unnecessary termination, corporations
2214960	2219120	can afford it, apart from termination, though they could probably just sue YouTube at that point,
2219120	2224960	and they can circumvent it in many ways, and we know those rules impact us more than them.
2224960	2229360	I don't think Spill are a plant by YouTube themselves, I'm sure YouTube would give them much
2229360	2234000	easier treatment than the one they have allegedly been receiving, and honestly, I think a channel
2234000	2239680	like Spill would be a bit of an elaborate plan, I think it's just another company trying to get a
2239680	2245120	piece of the pie, for better and for worse. However, I don't think corporations can ever
2245120	2249840	recreate the sort of personality that an individual in front of the microphone can capture,
2249840	2254480	because it requires levels of consistency and understanding of the actual communities that
2254480	2259120	out of touch businesses filled with employees would have trouble capturing, and the fact that
2259120	2264800	Spill tried to spin their origin story in such a way originally is proof that they are not as in
2264800	2269920	touch as they like to present themselves as, and I do think audiences identify that. I don't think
2269920	2274880	corporations can ever wholly replace individual creators, fortunately because they don't have
2274880	2279680	a monopoly on the means of production in many genres, a lot of people have access to a semi-decent
2279680	2284320	microphone or camera that will enable them for content creation. That's the strange thing about
2284320	2288560	Spill, although they could be a concern in that they reflect the fact that a corporate owned
2288560	2294080	entity has more access to behave in a more human fashion, I also think that underlines their
2294080	2298480	weakness. The fact that the creation of a persona relies often so much on an individual that the
2298480	2303760	individual could then just say, well you give me more control or else I leave, seems to be an
2303760	2309120	important bargaining chip for channels that are more persona oriented. Therefore, corporations
2309120	2313040	always have to be somewhat restrained in the relationships that they create with their audience
2313040	2317360	in ways that independent creators can work around. Corporations have to make sure their ingredients
2317360	2321600	are somewhat replaceable, because if the creation of that character comes from anything unique to a
2321600	2325840	person surrounding that channel, then that person could perceptively gain more control than the
2325840	2330400	actual corporation. There's a lot of things businesses can switch in and switch out, but
2330400	2335680	persona is a tough one. Spill does great research and great formulation of content, they have neat
2335680	2340640	animations, but that's not what audiences are looking for alone. There will always be an appeal
2340640	2345520	for people with a bit more sass, a bit more personality, a bit more edge to them, and YouTube
2345520	2350560	can pull all the algorithmic strings to give that sort of content an advantage, but I compare
2350560	2355600	YouTube's behaviours to the metaphor of taking a horse to water. They can put a load of family
2355600	2361120	friendly mediocre mainstream content on people's homepage, but that will not satisfy some. For every
2361120	2367040	Troom Troom, Bright Side, Looper, WatchMojo, there'll be a MrBeast, an iDubbbz, an I Hate Everything,
2367040	2371840	someone to represent that more organic vision of YouTube. I wouldn't say that they're all
2371840	2376320	tour de forces of personality in what they do, but the connections that they create with their
2376320	2382160	audiences are much more direct and genuine, and audiences recognise that. I think in many ways
2382160	2387840	that's what people come on YouTube for. YouTube could take away every means of support, and I
2387840	2392720	think we'd find a way to persevere, and although we should always fight for fair treatment, we
2392720	2397360	should have some confidence in our own self-sufficiency. Let's conclude this tale then. I do
2397360	2401440	think it's pretty clear that Spill weren't completely honest with how they presented themselves
2401440	2406400	in their origins, and I do understand why they wanted to downplay certain elements of their story.
2406400	2411120	You know corporation is a word with a lot of negative connotations within the YouTube community,
2411120	2415440	but all the video did was show that they were kind of out of touch with what the community
2415440	2420640	wanted. The way they utilised certain common creator struggles as ways to boost those credentials
2420640	2425040	felt surface level, and I think if they'd just provided a bit more context to their story,
2425040	2429920	people would have been okay with that. Instead it seemed like an attempt to cover up those ties,
2429920	2434800	which led to more anxiety within the community, with people wondering what ulterior motives they
2434800	2440320	had to hide it. I feel it was just a clumsy attempt to retain an image that they may not have earned,
2440320	2444640	though I understand that given the recent situation regarding YouTube's treatment of creators,
2444640	2449440	people may be a bit more on edge. And as noted, it's clear to me that Spill isn't quite as
2449440	2454240	masterful with the game as YouTube as they might appear, and are quite clunky in certain aspects
2454240	2459360	of management, which can have negative effects on their own and is completely viable for criticism.
2459360	2463680	However, with my previous points in mind, I'd also like to say that they might be running quite a
2463680	2467440	good business. The fact that the voice of the channel Taylor seems to be happily working on
2467440	2471920	the project despite having heavy negotiating power over the brand tells me that maybe they're
2471920	2476160	just doing something good for themselves and those around them. However, I'd also emphasise that
2476160	2480640	currently they do seem to be a bit out of touch, and are probably missing out on a lot of potential
2480640	2485760	income. You can all do better, and if you need any thoughts, my DMs are open. As for the effects on
2485760	2489840	the community, Spill clearly have a way of contributing positively to the discussion,
2489840	2494400	and I really do rate that. It's nice to have someone who uses citations and research to the
2494400	2499120	maximum effect, and there were a couple of instances in the past where Spill were interacting
2499120	2503280	positively with those in the community, but recently people who've been calling them out for
2503280	2508400	this escapade have been framed more antagonistically by certain followers of Spill. People have been
2508400	2513120	head-estalling them and stating that these critics are just upset they're not as good or successful,
2513120	2517760	and I don't think it's about that. As stated in this video, I think it's about that people feel
2517760	2522320	that their careers are threatened by this empty shell, and they don't have the resources to stand
2522320	2527200	up in that capacity, and it just gives YouTube more power to steamroll out harsher changes that
2527200	2532480	don't affect these large conglomerates and create this completely sanitized website. It is a worrying
2532480	2536960	thought. At the same time, I don't think Spill pertain those specific intentions, though it would
2536960	2541360	be cool if they were a bit more involved in the community. I think the alienation has built up
2541360	2545680	some disconnect between them and other creators which has probably led to this situation, and we
2545680	2550320	don't want that. I don't think audience demand for other people in the community will decrease,
2550320	2554400	and I am hopeful that YouTube will be able to recognize the contribution that independent
2554400	2558960	creators do make, and how many viewers they bring in. I think it's a principle of YouTube that they
2558960	2563120	would cripple themselves in attempting to wipe out, they wouldn't want to take that risk in my
2563120	2568240	opinion, and I don't think there's any way to fully plant corporations in the place of the individual
2568240	2572880	creator, although they have given many people rough treatment of recent, but that's also gonna
2572880	2577680	be a topic for another time. For the moment, keep making the content you love, and try and be honest
2577760	2581680	about who you are. People don't mind that much as long as you haven't spat on any docks.
2583920	2588720	So yes, that was the video, I hope you enjoyed, my lateral battery is almost dead now, and I left the
2588720	2593840	charger upstairs, so I need to get through this as quickly as possible. I want to give a big shout
2593840	2598160	out to my editors who've done a fantastic job, please go and check them out, they're beautiful
2598160	2604720	people, and I also want to give a big shout out to my Patreons, $10 Patreons are on screen right now,
2604720	2612560	$50 Patreons, somehullabaloo, Spector Angel, Rocket Ralph, Sarah Elizabeth Caroline, thank you so much,
2612560	2619040	and my $100 Patreons, Brandon, Adam Michael, and Christopher Caress, they mean a lot to me, you know,
2619040	2624560	you guys are fantastic, please keep up the great work. If you want to contact me, socials, Twitter
2624560	2628800	at The Right Opinion, Facebook The Right Official, I really need to check my DMs there actually, I probably
2628800	2634960	haven't done that for a long time, and Discord in the pinned comment, you can find all the links
2634960	2639280	there. I don't think I have too much else to add, hopefully, you know, we'll be having a good time
2639280	2644800	when this video comes out, I guess we'll see, but until then, take care my friends, I'm The Right Opinion,
2644800	2646800	and I'll see you in the next one.
