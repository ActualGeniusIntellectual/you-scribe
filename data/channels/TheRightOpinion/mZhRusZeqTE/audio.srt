00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,680
Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with

2
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:12,720
too much free time, and today we need to take a meme and go behind it.

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:19,160
Wow, I'm so excited, no fuck you, Pyro and M both already did that joke, today's topic

4
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:23,840
is not going to make you enthusiastic or happy, or anything like Kyle or behind the meme seems

5
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,400
to attempt to or attempted to convey through his videos, no today we're dealing with topics

6
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,120
that aren't inherently happy, so I'm sorry to anyone who came to my channel looking for

7
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:36,500
a happy smiley person, my life is misery, soon yours will be too.

8
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:40,800
Because today we're dealing with the tragic tale of behind the meme, and issues surrounding

9
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,640
semantics regarding that, and boy do we have a lot to discuss, because I'm going to be

10
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:50,320
talking about a lot of concepts, some of them a bit more philosophical even, because I think

11
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,840
it encompasses an interesting element of content creation, and we'll get to that in a bit,

12
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,220
the first behind the meme, who is he to all those who may not be aware of his infamy.

13
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:04,180
So essentially behind the meme is a meme channel set up by creator Kyle Bryce, don't worry

14
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:09,000
his name is public, but he brands it as having the intention of educating those who are unfamiliar

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
with memes, providing the audience with a relatively light explanation of the origin

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,220
of the meme and applications of it.

17
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:19,400
To take a quick example, Harambe, Harambe is a deceased gorilla who eventually became

18
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:23,280
a meme after the meme connoisseurs decided it would be, and in this instance behind the

19
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,040
meme explains how Harambe has came to be, you know, whole enclosure incident, satirisation

20
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,120
of people's reaction, and so on.

21
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:34,200
These videos rapidly picked up steam, with views coming in from the first upload.

22
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,520
This wasn't Kyle's first channel, so he knew how to make his video semi-competent, he quickly

23
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,680
upgraded and realised the business opportunity, it was all going right, video after video

24
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:46,920
was a hit with the audience, and he was flying high with a group of people who had his back.

25
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,760
Yet fast forward less than 2 and a half years later, and it's almost like we've stepped

26
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:54,840
into a different dimension, the happy colourful behind the meme is gone, and in its place

27
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:00,200
is a shell, a shell that is the draw of multiple controversies over the span of just over a year.

28
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:04,320
Well, after a spell where his videos were performing abysmally with views and ratings

29
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,040
alike, he took a break.

30
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:10,040
Now we'll delve into the details of why this flatlined in a bit, stay patient my friends,

31
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:14,160
however with every break came the return, and behind the meme came back to a fanfare

32
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,520
of broken brass, however the video he posted, what happened to behind the meme, seemed to

33
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:23,280
represent a perspective of hope, one in which he had been dragged down by so much, but now

34
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,800
he was in a better place, ready not to fumble this situation.

35
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,360
But I have done a tremendous amount of growing over the last few months while away from this

36
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,340
channel, growing that has only been able to happen thanks to the luxuries YouTube has

37
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:35,380
afforded me.

38
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:39,160
This personal development wouldn't have happened had I not taken a bit of time to myself to

39
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:42,520
attempt to discover who I am and what happiness means to me.

40
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:46,840
He had almost 800,000 subscribers, most of us will never receive that opportunity, he

41
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:50,240
was a new man, ready to take on the world.

42
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:55,080
But then he posted his 5 part series, which were dark in their presentation and disturbing

43
00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:00,040
in their context, with mental breakdowns, vague foreshadowing language, a far cry from

44
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:04,960
his initially rather innocent child friendly content of his meme synopsis videos.

45
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:09,040
This understandably had people concerned, eventually at the end of this 5 part series,

46
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,880
a fellow to say he was staged.

47
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:14,740
This has understandably caused a whirlwind of reactions within the community, ranging

48
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,600
from sympathy to criticism.

49
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:20,360
What we're going to do today is break it all down, because honestly, it is an absolute

50
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:24,980
clusterfuck and it's hard to work out who's right, who's wrong, and if anyone is right

51
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:25,980
to be honest.

52
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:29,700
Today I have a lot of questions that many people have, why did this happen, why did

53
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:34,520
the innocent meme reviewer end up in what must be some sort of delusional state of mind,

54
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:38,480
what were the causes of this, were these causes justified, how could such a cheerful person

55
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,960
so intent on spreading knowledge turn into one of the most twisted characters online?

56
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,560
I also want to precursor with the usual statement, that although it's important to be sympathetic

57
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,720
to anyone's mental conditions as they may influence their behaviour, it equally doesn't

58
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:55,960
alleviate actions, as a public figure, they ensure responsibility that is enabled by their

59
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,960
fan base.

60
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:01,600
I will be criticising the actions on an observational basis, what I see, and what I think, I don't

61
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,880
think I have too much to add, but there's a lot to discuss, so we might as well get

62
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,120
into it.

63
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,480
Do you ever wonder the meaning of today's popular memes?

64
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,160
Do you wonder about the history of some of the classics?

65
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:17,680
Do you sometimes feel left out when you see others using a term you've never heard before?

66
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,840
Don't worry, we have you covered.

67
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:24,080
In his Draw My Life video, Kyle, which is what I'll call him when addressing him personally,

68
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:29,140
noted that he was drawn to make a meme review channel during the Harambe craze, where people

69
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:34,060
were wondering what the meme was about exactly, something that crossed all of our minds undoubtedly

70
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:35,600
during the discovery of memes.

71
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,980
I think this is an interesting element, his channel was born out of something innate,

72
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:44,340
a curiosity that was found in many other people, which is arguably why it rose so quickly,

73
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:47,340
because his videos almost encompassed a growing curiosity.

74
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:52,200
Now if we are to pull up the Google trend mechanism, we can see that if we date behind

75
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:57,420
the memes channel inception at around August 2016, as a trend, memes were about to reach

76
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:58,420
their peak.

77
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:02,560
Now trends themselves encompass information very interestingly, because for me, a trend

78
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,460
like anything has phases.

79
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:08,420
Now there may be a scientific theory behind this, but let me just formulate my own hypothesis

80
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:09,700
to simplify it.

81
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:13,180
We have a phase of ignorance where we don't know anything about the topic, the discovery

82
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:17,780
phase where we're exposed to the topic, and then we have the rejection or assimilation

83
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:22,060
phase, where we either choose not to pursue such culture, or we throw ourselves in there.

84
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:26,420
What may follow afterwards, which isn't really documented here, is the forgetting phase,

85
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:28,900
which is where people begin to withdraw from such a topic.

86
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:34,080
Now memes is such a general culture that it's unlikely to die soon, however the specific

87
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,220
memes do have that.

88
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:40,060
These are all important factors to consider, because at the time that behind the memes

89
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:44,580
started up, we can see that the trend search for memes was heading in an upward projection.

90
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:49,900
If we were to apply my theory, an upward trend can only occur if more people are in the discovery

91
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:50,900
phase.

92
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:55,180
Now the discovery phase is marked by the transition from ignorance to knowledge, and people being

93
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:58,220
interested, but not really knowing where to start.

94
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:02,520
Now at that stage, many people need entry level understandings of memes, and I know

95
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:06,560
I'm talking about it like it's a fine art, but there is a craft to it, and these things

96
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,200
often exist on tiers, even when they're particularly subtle, so we're witnessing an influx of

97
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:15,740
people into this culture, and that's partly why behind the meme works so well, it was

98
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:19,800
aided by the fact that he started his channel during one of the most fertile periods for

99
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:24,160
these memes, and honestly, I watched the Harambe video, and although the production values

100
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:30,560
were fairly cheap, as videos in general go, it didn't seem bad, it was a fairly easy

101
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,280
video to open with, he was dealing with something that he knew people felt, and as channels

102
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:40,240
go that aid the discovery phase, it was tonally consistent in its presentation, it was simple,

103
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,280
it was straightforward, it had a demographic, and it knew its demographic like the back

104
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:48,560
of its hand, bright colours, a high energy voice, which we'll discuss more later, he

105
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,720
knew exactly who he was appealing to, the sort of people who wanted an explanation in

106
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:58,000
the most reduced fashion, we're not necessarily interested in dissecting the intricacies.

107
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,960
The other thing that we noticed by looking at Google Trends is that even though its gradient

108
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:07,000
was going upwards, it was already a strongly established genre, with a committed fanbase,

109
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
now memes differ in their size and longevity on the platform, and there are some memes

110
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,680
that still have relevance today in our conversations, some memes that outlast the rest, I want you

111
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,880
to hold this thought. Going back to the discovery phase, typically the memes that we discover

112
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:23,820
are the most popular rather than the most modern, now it's true that a modern meme

113
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:27,920
may be popular at the same time, but there will always be ones that are more iconic,

114
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:32,120
this is important as what behind the meme tended to do was go back to a lot of popular

115
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:36,740
old memes that may have existed before Harambe and cover them while the landscape was a tad

116
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:41,920
dry, whether it was Dat Boi, a meme from May 2016 a few months before, or even ones that

117
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:47,880
were a few years before, like Doge, which I'm not gonna call Doge, I think that's

118
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:53,460
frankly disgraceful, thank you, pronounce it Doge, don't put pineapples on pizza, two

119
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:59,340
simple principles, and I don't wanna hear it again Mr Bryce. Anyhow, Doge came from

120
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:03,980
2013 and he was covering it, this was a smart business move on his behalf, he knew which

121
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:08,180
topics to choose to keep the fans coming back for more, and how to draw in people who had

122
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:12,620
just discovered the wondrous concept of the meme. As mentioned earlier, behind the meme

123
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:17,460
was as inoffensive as the channels came, in fact Kyle seemed a fairly harmless person

124
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:21,700
just trying to provide an insight on the source of a meme, and this was an inherently positive

125
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:26,500
facet for a channel like his, he was completely out of the drama, how could someone like behind

126
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:30,940
the meme end up in drama? He also distanced himself from any other form of commentary

127
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:35,580
and didn't think to comment on such affairs. Now I will explain why this eventually came

128
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:39,580
back to hurt him, but being an independent creator allowed him to just hustle away on

129
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:44,780
his own, spreading memes to people who were probably drifting too with regards to content.

130
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:49,160
Behind the meme almost branded himself as a semi-commercial channel, many people compared

131
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:55,420
Kyle to a WatchMojo, as epitomised by that energetic commercial voice, and this is definitely

132
00:08:55,420 --> 00:09:00,600
not an unwarranted comparison, but he did attempt to build a closer brand with his viewers,

133
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,080
whereas WatchMojo kind of accepted that most of their viewers are gonna be in and out,

134
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,600
he did attempt to build a stronger bond, often trying to integrate a few more jokes, even

135
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:12,500
though they were a bit shit, and side comments that would establish his character, almost

136
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:17,840
trying to mimic Matthew Santoro, another creator who tried to integrate fairly generic ideas

137
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:21,980
with his own persona. Admittedly he didn't quite do it as well, lacking facecam just

138
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:25,940
kind of mutes the delivery on such expressive comments, but I can understand what he was

139
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:30,240
going for, and for a while it definitely worked for some people, his first video on Harambe

140
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:35,260
was just a basic explanation, with every video he tried to extend it and make it a bit longer

141
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:38,680
and taking the moments to add those extra bits of banter.

142
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:44,440
Fast food, America's favourite pastime, next to apple pie, baseball, and watching

143
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:48,480
porn, you better clear your search history before your mom comes into the room.

144
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:53,220
We have this channel that had this huge backlog of timeless memes, and a consistent style

145
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:58,460
and presentation and clear theme, it was an algorithms dream, so it jumped from strength

146
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:02,920
to strength, while at the same time you had this guy at the helm, although not overflowing

147
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:06,800
with personality, quirky enough, he could bring an audience back, and he had tapped

148
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:11,240
in trends that were on the rise, all of these things carried him forward, and by being a

149
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:15,500
very placid fellow, it seemed impossible that anyone would want to hate him for what

150
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:19,640
he was doing, I mean, it was completely harmless, was it not?

151
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:24,120
The content may have been simple, but who cares, it was helping people discover memes,

152
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:28,920
how could anyone ever stop someone when all they're doing is entertaining others?

153
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:33,840
Well let's talk about culture, MOTHERFUCKERS, right, so how on earth could someone like

154
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:40,240
behind the meme ever attract hate, he's wholesome, friendly, and completely harmless, or is he?

155
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:45,120
Now he hasn't touched any kids, hasn't made any racist tweets, and he certainly hasn't

156
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:50,080
sold any unreasonably priced Christmas calendars, so what the hell happened?

157
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:55,920
One word, commentary, you see, in commentary, we're a bunch of judgemental bastards, that's

158
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:00,880
not always a bad thing, but oh my god was behind the meme the epitome behind the notion

159
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:05,500
that no channel is beyond the concept of criticism, and that you can't just masquerade yourself

160
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:09,960
with a friendly persona to escape it, but how did people root out criticism out of something

161
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,800
so perceptively objective?

162
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:16,480
Well to do that we have to understand culture, without fundamental concepts of value, everything

163
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:21,600
is subjective, and as abstracts they still are to an extent, however once culture embeds

164
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,920
ideas with them, they can obtain relative levels of success, to take an example is maths,

165
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,680
or math as you american twats call it.

166
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:34,160
Maths make sense because we have assigned clear values to numbers, we have rationalised

167
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,200
them through culture, and this is important.

168
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,760
Now I'm not saying that culture is just this completely social construct, it may come from

169
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:46,960
evolutionary traits, but the point is that from these basic fundamental premises yield

170
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:51,080
many different cultures, and each of them are based in different ideas that set up what

171
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:56,000
is viewed as acceptable and what isn't, and that's typically a good thing, however this

172
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,860
competition does create something more objective, and that's how successful a culture is, with

173
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:07,260
regards to its premises, how well the people are doing in it, relative to not just themselves

174
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,780
but to other cultures.

175
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:13,620
In Emplemon's video you can see how clearly he contrasts the culture of what he calls

176
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:18,780
outsiders, people who are well educated in the notion of the meme, with normies, the

177
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,060
people who aren't.

178
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:25,180
The normies are, and have always been, the majority, the mainstream, the hump of the

179
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:26,180
bell curve.

180
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:30,380
The outsiders include anyone who rejects mainstream media in favour of content which matches their

181
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:33,260
more niche and unconventional tastes.

182
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:37,700
In the 80s, the outsiders were mocked and outcast by the normies, only able to seek

183
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:41,060
safety in the odd comic book store or sci-fi convention.

184
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:46,400
Now based on this, quote outsider culture as a generality probably has its aims.

185
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:51,220
These aims are subjective to the normies, however these are the aims that unite people

186
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:56,020
into this culture, and this is the one thing that behind the meme didn't understand, that

187
00:12:56,020 --> 00:13:01,060
there was a culture, and that to many people his videos contradicted that culture.

188
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:05,460
To the casual observer, it was just a guy talking about memes, to someone like Emplemon

189
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:10,180
it was an assault on everything that he stood for as a proud memer, and he had to send a

190
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:14,660
message to everyone who didn't understand what he felt, so he made that video.

191
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:18,400
So I just want to take these last few minutes to tie up some loose ends.

192
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:22,900
First of all I want to say that I do not hate behind the meme, I just hate this idea that

193
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:27,580
what he's doing is perfectly okay, and that we have some sort of obligation to make sure

194
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:32,660
that no normie gets left behind, no, he has to understand that there are negative consequences

195
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:33,660
to what he's doing.

196
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:39,740
This represents what I'd brand meme patriotism, which sounds kinda bizarre, but let me explain,

197
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:44,020
there's a culture that many people believe is the best way to go, it creates the best

198
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:49,260
memes, creates the best banter in a majority of their opinions, and people are happy with

199
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:50,260
it.

200
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:53,800
And then you have someone like behind the meme coming in and executing the ideas in

201
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:58,140
a different way that contradicts how people view it, and it's an affront to them, but

202
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:02,440
most of all it's an affront to the culture in general, and those memers who have always

203
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:07,380
been ostracised from the normie world now have the same normie world turning up and

204
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:12,740
trying to co-opt their sacred memes, which is what is part of their identity.

205
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:17,060
Basically it's meme cultural appropriation, can't believe I just said that, and I'm definitely

206
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:20,920
exaggerating there, but you get what I'm saying, and because these people entered this

207
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:24,840
culture and were counter-productive to these values, people felt that their memes were

208
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,340
being affected.

209
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:29,640
Emblemen's concern was that the quality of these memes was being degraded, and their

210
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:34,380
lifespan decreased, now I don't think behind the meme as an individual was front and centre

211
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:38,660
to that idea, and honestly the thought that this guy could somehow ruin the length and

212
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:44,120
trend of memes seems a bit far-fetched, particularly given how memes had a variability, but I can

213
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:48,440
see when applying these standards that behind the meme does run counter-intuitively to those

214
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,960
cultural fundamentals.

215
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:55,000
Emblemen's video arguably did over dramatise the implications, but as a comprehensive criticism

216
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,120
of content it served its purpose fairly well, and that's what commentary is, it was the

217
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,400
same with Jinx, same with Lele Pons, on the surface they never did anything obscenely

218
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:08,600
awful, but make content that by our standards was bad, but when you look deeper people feel

219
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:13,920
that content like that, behind the meme included, has implications on how culture is viewed,

220
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:18,200
how people engage with it themselves, and how that conflicts with their views, and how

221
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,900
that affects their enjoyment.

222
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:24,320
The commentary community is a savage bunch, and if there's a set of creators who make

223
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:29,160
what many commentators view as subpar content, and they don't receive criticism, which there

224
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:33,380
are a few, it's only because those creators have ties to the community, and half the commentators

225
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:37,040
are also cowardly hypocrites who don't want to upset ties to the creators who they may

226
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,080
be associated with, but don't tell them I said that.

227
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:45,040
Anyhow, my point is, don't ever believe that the community merely goes after the criminals,

228
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,720
behind the meme is a prime example of that, they went against what had been established

229
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,360
culture and they were torn apart for that.

230
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,080
On top of this, it didn't help that behind the meme's content was as safe and commercial

231
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:59,520
as it could be, something that meme content is antithetic to, so suddenly the idea that

232
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:04,260
he used stock photos became an insult, and so many other elements, it's not offensive,

233
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:08,820
but it's unoriginal, uninspired, generic cookie cutter content, which would make someone who's

234
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:11,940
ingrained in the culture feel insulted by.

235
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:15,900
These people who are discovering memes are gonna be introduced to this guy, as some sort

236
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:25,140
of quote teacher as he likes to brand himself, it's like fraud to some of his harshest critics,

237
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:29,340
he's selling himself as a connoisseur, but the truth is far from that pitch.

238
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:33,380
So instead of really having this person who made wholesome, harmless content, people felt

239
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:37,420
suddenly their meme culture was under attack from people like behind the meme who were

240
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:42,620
simplifying and misrepresenting their work, commercialising it and essentially normifying

241
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:43,620
it.

242
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:48,860
And as many of these people on the website found themselves there because they were alienated

243
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:53,900
by the same mainstream culture, it was like a kick in the face, it's sentimentally based

244
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:58,740
argumentation, but I understand it, so what would be a content critique was turned into

245
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:04,580
an actual movement against a creator for what he represents, the selling out of memes.

246
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:14,700
And boy, does that open a whole new can of worms for Mr Bryce here.

247
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:19,200
Now as said, behind the meme so desperately tried to avoid involving himself in anything

248
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:24,340
drama related, so when the drama did finally transpire, he had no clue how to react properly.

249
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:28,360
M Lemon's video was extremely influential, but he wasn't the first prominent creator

250
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,360
to cover him.

251
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:33,500
As the Fantano host of the now defunct That Is The Plan, another meme review channel,

252
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:37,780
made a video satirising behind the meme, touching on its commercialism and lack of

253
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:55,880
originality and personality.

254
00:17:55,880 --> 00:18:00,420
It was pretty funny, and exactly the sort of bait that only an insecure fool would fall

255
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:01,420
for.

256
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:05,780
However, behind the meme is an insecure fool, and trying to respond, placing him in a position

257
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:07,860
that was completely out of his comfort zone.

258
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:12,580
Now this already compromised two core elements of him and left him savagely exposed.

259
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:16,140
As mentioned earlier, he had always tried to create a more personal connection with

260
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:20,020
his audience, now when combining this with his content, although his personality was

261
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:24,240
definitely contrived, it was passable, it kinda came with the territory.

262
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,260
When you're stepping out of your comfort zone and responding to someone in a way where

263
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:30,600
you're not just providing information like your other content, and you're actually

264
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:34,620
trying to express legitimate argumentative points, you can't just do it in a happy,

265
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:39,820
jolly tone, especially when trying to convey other emotions, it sounds unhealthy.

266
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:41,900
So why on earth did he respond like this?

267
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:45,700
It's the classic problem of being a stranger to criticism for so long.

268
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:49,680
When we all receive harsh criticism for the first time round, it feels huge, it takes

269
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:53,580
a massive toll on us, like everything, it just knocks us back, and whenever we face

270
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:57,100
it down, everything in the moment just seems bigger than it actually is.

271
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:01,220
We feel it's coming for our reputation and our standing, and we feel the need to defend

272
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:02,220
ourselves.

273
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:06,140
With that said, responding to a satire is pretty far-fetched, and through this, Carl

274
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:10,700
exhibited extensive insecurity in the content that he was making, possibly validating the

275
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:13,760
criticisms being levelled at him by Fantano.

276
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:17,420
When you watch a serious Matthew Santoro vid, it's not done with the tone,

277
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:22,060
Welcome back guys, Matthew Santoro, and today we have to talk about domestic abuse, which

278
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:25,220
makes me very sad.

279
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:29,300
The videos are a completely different tone, and they allow Santoro to open up a new side

280
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:34,140
to the audience, which more successfully builds a relationship than any transfer of persona.

281
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:38,740
That's what Bryce needed to do, and instead we got this.

282
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:43,340
In all seriousness, this video was all in good fun, I just had to respond to Anthony's

283
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:47,820
video because he randomly decided to attack me and my viewers, and I didn't like that.

284
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:52,600
Jesus Christ, and once M. Lemon and videos that followed from other creators showed up

285
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,800
how fragile his persona was, it put him on borrowed time.

286
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,800
The problem was, he hit a characteristic contradiction.

287
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:03,100
His tone was too much like a WatchMojo host, as mentioned earlier, and you can't create

288
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,800
a deeper persona for that.

289
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:08,220
In fact, watching the videos, although he did attempt to deepen his character in ways

290
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:13,120
we'll address soon, one of the very awkward changes was he progressively upped his persona

291
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,120
to 11.

292
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,720
If we go from one of his first videos...

293
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:19,760
Hello internet, and welcome to Behind The Meme, where we take a look at the meaning

294
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,460
and the origin of your favourite memes.

295
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:23,960
Today we have a look at Dodge.

296
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:24,960
To this...

297
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:29,960
Hello internet, and welcome to Behind The Meme.

298
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:33,140
Today we have a look at Gru's plan.

299
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:37,040
The only change is the increasingly insipid tone.

300
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:41,640
He seems to have wrongly attributed his quirky persona to the success of the channel, and

301
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:47,080
he so continues to up the gears, and it becomes nauseating and so transparently fake.

302
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,960
This will become particularly problematic for your viewer base, who are going to be

303
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:54,200
drawn in by your rather juvenile tone, because they'll inevitably grow out of it.

304
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:57,680
In spite of the criticisms, the least you could say is that your Harambe video could

305
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:00,000
be watched by people of all ages.

306
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,800
Any of the newer stuff seems specifically aimed at the youngest denomination who will

307
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,680
never stick around anyway.

308
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:09,860
What inflames this scenario is the zeitgeist, as said multiple times before, this was the

309
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:13,960
era where happy-go-lucky personas died.

310
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:18,380
We want brooding, deeper characters, and his persona became outdated very quickly.

311
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:22,260
Equally, when trying to develop character, he often turned to a very sensitive topic

312
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:26,700
like Stefan Karl, and once again, I can't look into a person's mind and decipher their

313
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:30,620
motivations for making a video like that, but it seemed more of a way to prove that

314
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:34,700
he was a good guy, and although I don't necessarily think showing that you're a kind person is

315
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:39,660
a bad thing, if you go out of your way to make videos that divert from your normal style,

316
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:45,340
and on top of it, immediately after you receive criticism, as documented by my best mate Pyro,

317
00:21:45,340 --> 00:22:08,020
it seems rather insincere.

318
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:12,140
It doesn't seem like character development, it seems like a construction of what he wants

319
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:17,460
people to see, the topics of your videos should not solely be dictating your character, however,

320
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:20,900
none of this mattered as long as he was still pulling views.

321
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:25,780
As noted on my Zoe Burger video, providing you have a positive like to dislike ratio,

322
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:29,860
your video typically tends to maintain rotation with the YouTube algorithms, if it's on

323
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:32,220
a trending meme, we're all quids in.

324
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:37,100
You see, in a way, behind the meme situation, Ag created a very strange dynamic, the criticism

325
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:41,980
from commentators like Emp, Fantano, and Pyro, meant that there was this sway of the

326
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:47,100
people who were completely out for blood whenever he uploaded, he gained a level of infamy,

327
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:50,980
equally though, if he could reach beyond there and hit a demographic of casual viewers, he'd

328
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:54,780
probably be able to alleviate the hatred, as those people aren't really concerned

329
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:58,420
with the culture, and at first, this seemed to be the case, he seemed to be able to scrape

330
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:03,220
the views to keep a positive ratio over those who were vehemently against him.

331
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:08,420
However, barely a year after all this had began, in August, the dislikes began to win

332
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:11,540
out, and it began to kill him.

333
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:15,660
Probably one of the most ironic tales to this is that people who he introduced memes to,

334
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:20,000
who provided him the views and support at the initial stage, then likely were the ones

335
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,980
who became more educated, and were then the ones to come back and contribute to his channel's

336
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:25,980
demise.

337
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:29,260
That's the thing, if you're an unassuming citizen discovering memes, then behind the

338
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:33,140
meme is perfect, once you're in the culture, you don't need him, and in fact, you may

339
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:34,700
come to loathe him.

340
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:39,820
Equally, as the popularity of the meme stopped its ascension, he had less people to introduce

341
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:44,660
it to, and increased accessibility online to memes further meant that he had even less

342
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:46,280
utility than before.

343
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:51,060
On top of this, he used his get out of jail free meme cards early on, by covering old

344
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:55,900
popular more timeless memes already, he had nothing left, and he had to rely on the modern

345
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:57,520
memes to be popular.

346
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,820
And as Emp rightfully noted, although we've definitely experienced an increase in the

347
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:05,060
number of memes, and some of them do seem popular in the moment, they're not lasting

348
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:09,140
the way that many of the older ones did, and that just doesn't bode well for a channel

349
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:14,240
like behind the meme, the markets had been flooded, his time was up, there was nothing,

350
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,900
his personality gave us nothing, his content gave us nothing, and the audience response

351
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:22,320
had soured, and the demand had plateaued.

352
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:27,240
It was a timely death, and eventually after a run with diminishing returns, behind the

353
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:30,740
meme stopped.

354
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:32,840
But it wasn't over.

355
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:43,720
As said, Kyle clearly viewed himself as being able to rebrand, his meme review was dead,

356
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:48,040
but what if he changed his content, did something else he was passionate about, there were so

357
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:51,280
many opportunities out there for him that he could pursue.

358
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:55,560
He made the return video we spoke about, there made a tribute video to Stefan Karl

359
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:58,480
after his passing, and then came his little series.

360
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:03,920
Now, I'm not going to detail every single thing, but I am going to give a quick summary,

361
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:06,940
just so people know what this is about, if you wanna watch the videos, they're still

362
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:07,940
up on his channel.

363
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:12,360
It begins with a trip to the store in which he buys the most familiar brand of vodka,

364
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:15,640
Smirnoff, implying that there will be intoxicated antics occurring.

365
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:19,960
In his second video he has consumed some vodka, shoots the shit, talks vaguely about the future

366
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:24,500
of his channel, showing you around his house and making random comments, and so on.

367
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:28,920
The third episode includes him driving intoxicated, and then talking about some deep stuff while

368
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:29,920
contemplating.

369
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:33,240
So here is the character development, we're getting a bit deeper, a bit darker.

370
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:36,160
Now there are some details that I'm going to leave out, because I think they're important

371
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:40,880
for the judgement, but you can tell that his tone is changing, and becoming more disturbed.

372
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:45,920
The fourth episode is more of this, just him back in an indoor environment, crying, drinking

373
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,280
more, and so on.

374
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:52,200
And the final episode is the fateful moment where he takes his own life, truly tragic.

375
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:57,420
Of course, it was a ruse, but why did he do something like this, well to prove a point,

376
00:25:57,420 --> 00:26:01,020
he was telling his story of how he felt, and the hate he received.

377
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:05,400
But through my experience, it caused me to take a step back and have a look at our society

378
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,620
as a whole.

379
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:11,020
How we treat each other unfairly, how quick we are to turn our backs on another human,

380
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:15,220
how easily it is to forget we're all in the same boat just trying to get by.

381
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:19,500
Sadly, all these negative characteristics seem to be amplified on the internet where

382
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,660
people think they are anonymous.

383
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:25,860
It sucks, but that is how our society seems to conduct itself lately.

384
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:30,540
It's clear through this, he felt a lot of it was unwarranted, and yielded unnecessary

385
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:31,780
consequences.

386
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:32,780
So how do I feel?

387
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:34,220
Is he right?

388
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:36,380
Was the hate too much?

389
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:38,380
Well I think it's a double edged sword.

390
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:42,100
The problem is, we as public figures have to be prepared to take criticism.

391
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:45,540
The thing about behind the meme is that he never really dealt criticism.

392
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:48,020
As he said, he was just spreading positivity.

393
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:50,580
How can you hate someone for spreading love?

394
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:55,120
And on one hand, I don't think the hate messages, cruel comments, and so on are justified.

395
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:59,300
If they're directed in a personal fashion, they're very seldom justified, and I'll stand

396
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:00,300
by that.

397
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:03,480
And if you want to challenge them and take them on, then more power to you.

398
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:08,300
Things like doxing also absolutely terrible, and I think calling out people like that is

399
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:09,300
reasonable.

400
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:14,660
And the sort of vague narrative that was constructed through this seems to encompass all the culture

401
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:18,820
as hate, and whether you meant it to come across that way, the sort of very forced comments

402
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:22,860
that were inserted in the build up was the one identifiably fake element, although it

403
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:25,940
was implausible, it was otherwise well done.

404
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:30,980
Here's the point, as a guy, you may be lovely, you may be delightful, and although some of

405
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:31,980
M.P.

406
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:36,680
Lemon's criticism seems slightly doubtful to me, they weren't based in impossible outcomes,

407
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:41,440
and they were delivered in a way that separated the creator from the content, and they weren't

408
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:45,240
particularly harsh, although they did imply some strong consequences.

409
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:49,540
At the end of the video, M.P. even says this himself, that he's not there to hate on behind

410
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:54,060
the meme of the person, not hate on Kyle, so whether it was Kyle's intention to turn

411
00:27:54,060 --> 00:28:00,280
criticism onto M.P. or Pyro, or anyone else who kind of led this cultural war, or not,

412
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:04,680
the fans who are interpreting it that way right now really need to think about this.

413
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:08,920
As creators, we can have a responsibility with how we deal our message.

414
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:13,440
If we feel someone is making bad content or can do better, we shouldn't hold our tongues.

415
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,280
If we can turn it into a good video, then hell, we should go for it.

416
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:21,280
I don't know why we wouldn't, and equally, there will always be people who take up a

417
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,280
cause with the sole purpose of hating.

418
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:28,640
What we need to make sure is that we don't rile people up unnecessarily, I don't think

419
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,860
any of the critics that we spoke about today did that.

420
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:36,040
Equally M.P. did actually see behind the memes channel as an actual threat to a culture

421
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:40,460
very intimate to him, of course he was going to make a video on it, he wants to see his

422
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:45,140
community thrive, behind the meme stood against that to him, and so of course it became a

423
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:49,720
discourse of what's best for a community, and that's a complex conversation, and people

424
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:53,740
misinterpret it, but it didn't make his points less valid.

425
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:58,180
Equally I find the notion of why can't we all just be positive, utterly pretentious,

426
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:02,660
and everyone knows I've never liked it, criticism isn't always meant to be positive,

427
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:07,180
imagine that being the case for movies, the transformers films entertained a lot of people,

428
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:10,860
made a lot of people happy, doesn't mean that people can't find reasonable explanations

429
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:16,260
to bash on it and deal out criticism, Ray Sremmurd, I am not a fan, but some people

430
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:20,900
really enjoy it, but it doesn't mean I shouldn't hate it, do I endorse sending hate messages

431
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:21,900
to the lads?

432
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:26,520
No, not at all, they're making music, but you have to separate those two elements, or

433
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:31,520
else it just seems like you're using suicide to get back at your critic, which is never

434
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,100
a good look.

435
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:36,800
Positivity can be a dangerous fail for very sketchy behaviour, and if you don't go after

436
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:40,620
someone simply because they seem nice on the surface, you may be looking over some very

437
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:44,640
seedy business, which there have been many examples of.

438
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:48,740
Criticism doesn't always make us feel good, but we're not entitled to a bubble of happiness

439
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:52,760
and smiles, and when I deal criticism, I'll do my best to be honest and fair, but at the

440
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:58,040
same time, I know someone might still be offended by it, it's down to them to harness that criticism,

441
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:01,520
and that's something Behind The Meme never did, he never changed his content for the

442
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:05,120
better, he never listened to what people were saying, and he paid the price for that in

443
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,720
the subsequent ratings.

444
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:11,020
I can't really feel bad for him on that behalf, at the end of the day, someone made a better

445
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:15,880
argument for why his content wasn't that good, regardless of who it pleased, or how positive

446
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:16,880
it was.

447
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,720
Khan was Behind The Meme mostly in the past, and I think that's sensible, it's had its

448
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:26,120
day, and as concepts, his channel was on its way out regardless, even without the hate.

449
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:29,880
I don't know if he's gonna have trouble restarting, as I feel like a lot of his critics will stick

450
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:33,760
around, but maybe we can become familiarised with a different side of a person who we've

451
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,840
really only gone after that one persona in the past.

452
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:37,880
I feel it's time.

453
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,520
Is Behind The Meme a victim?

454
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:43,680
It depends how you define victimhood, if being subject to disproportionate hate makes him

455
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:48,500
a victim, then yeah, he might well be, it seemed unnecessary, but at the same time it's

456
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:52,300
a consistent principle applied across all realms of commentary.

457
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:56,180
We've all received death threats, and looking at the actual creators who've criticised

458
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:59,780
them, they haven't been particularly harsh, and attacking them for merely having narratives

459
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:02,060
that contradict your image doesn't wash with me.

460
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:06,580
At the end of the day, they're just creators who wanted you to do your genre more justice,

461
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:11,460
and I hope that you will keep that in mind when taking your content in a future direction.

462
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:16,500
So yeah, those are my fairly extensive thoughts on Behind The Meme, interesting bloke, I would

463
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:19,780
love to hear your thoughts in the comments below, please tell me what you think.

464
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:23,740
Also I wanna give a big shoutout to the editors as always, I'm going to leave their links

465
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:27,620
in the pinned comment, go check them out, have a subscribe, they do a lot of good work

466
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:28,660
for me.

467
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:33,540
These videos would not be as top notch as they are without the help of these editors,

468
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:34,940
so definitely check them out if you can.

469
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:41,180
If you wanna reach me on Twitter, at TheRightOpinion, Facebook, I'll leave my links there, in the

470
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:45,660
pinned comment too, Discord, also in the pinned comment, everything's in the pinned comment.

471
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:48,100
I wanna give everyone some love.

472
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:51,860
Anyhow, I don't think I really have too much else to add, I don't know exactly when this

473
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:56,620
is gonna be out, but I hope it's out in time to at least maintain some of your interest.

474
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:58,620
Anyhow, we'll just have to find that out.

475
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:01,980
Until then, I'm TheRightOpinion, and I'll see you in the next one.
