Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with

00:08.680 --> 00:12.720
too much free time, and today we need to take a meme and go behind it.

00:12.720 --> 00:19.160
Wow, I'm so excited, no fuck you, Pyro and M both already did that joke, today's topic

00:19.160 --> 00:23.840
is not going to make you enthusiastic or happy, or anything like Kyle or behind the meme seems

00:23.840 --> 00:28.400
to attempt to or attempted to convey through his videos, no today we're dealing with topics

00:28.400 --> 00:32.120
that aren't inherently happy, so I'm sorry to anyone who came to my channel looking for

00:32.120 --> 00:36.500
a happy smiley person, my life is misery, soon yours will be too.

00:36.500 --> 00:40.800
Because today we're dealing with the tragic tale of behind the meme, and issues surrounding

00:40.800 --> 00:45.640
semantics regarding that, and boy do we have a lot to discuss, because I'm going to be

00:45.640 --> 00:50.320
talking about a lot of concepts, some of them a bit more philosophical even, because I think

00:50.320 --> 00:54.840
it encompasses an interesting element of content creation, and we'll get to that in a bit,

00:54.840 --> 00:59.220
the first behind the meme, who is he to all those who may not be aware of his infamy.

00:59.220 --> 01:04.180
So essentially behind the meme is a meme channel set up by creator Kyle Bryce, don't worry

01:04.180 --> 01:09.000
his name is public, but he brands it as having the intention of educating those who are unfamiliar

01:09.000 --> 01:13.000
with memes, providing the audience with a relatively light explanation of the origin

01:13.000 --> 01:15.220
of the meme and applications of it.

01:15.220 --> 01:19.400
To take a quick example, Harambe, Harambe is a deceased gorilla who eventually became

01:19.400 --> 01:23.280
a meme after the meme connoisseurs decided it would be, and in this instance behind the

01:23.280 --> 01:28.040
meme explains how Harambe has came to be, you know, whole enclosure incident, satirisation

01:28.040 --> 01:30.120
of people's reaction, and so on.

01:30.120 --> 01:34.200
These videos rapidly picked up steam, with views coming in from the first upload.

01:34.200 --> 01:38.520
This wasn't Kyle's first channel, so he knew how to make his video semi-competent, he quickly

01:38.520 --> 01:42.680
upgraded and realised the business opportunity, it was all going right, video after video

01:42.680 --> 01:46.920
was a hit with the audience, and he was flying high with a group of people who had his back.

01:46.920 --> 01:50.760
Yet fast forward less than 2 and a half years later, and it's almost like we've stepped

01:50.760 --> 01:54.840
into a different dimension, the happy colourful behind the meme is gone, and in its place

01:54.840 --> 02:00.200
is a shell, a shell that is the draw of multiple controversies over the span of just over a year.

02:00.200 --> 02:04.320
Well, after a spell where his videos were performing abysmally with views and ratings

02:04.320 --> 02:06.040
alike, he took a break.

02:06.040 --> 02:10.040
Now we'll delve into the details of why this flatlined in a bit, stay patient my friends,

02:10.040 --> 02:14.160
however with every break came the return, and behind the meme came back to a fanfare

02:14.160 --> 02:18.520
of broken brass, however the video he posted, what happened to behind the meme, seemed to

02:18.520 --> 02:23.280
represent a perspective of hope, one in which he had been dragged down by so much, but now

02:23.280 --> 02:26.800
he was in a better place, ready not to fumble this situation.

02:26.800 --> 02:30.360
But I have done a tremendous amount of growing over the last few months while away from this

02:30.360 --> 02:34.340
channel, growing that has only been able to happen thanks to the luxuries YouTube has

02:34.340 --> 02:35.380
afforded me.

02:35.380 --> 02:39.160
This personal development wouldn't have happened had I not taken a bit of time to myself to

02:39.160 --> 02:42.520
attempt to discover who I am and what happiness means to me.

02:42.520 --> 02:46.840
He had almost 800,000 subscribers, most of us will never receive that opportunity, he

02:46.840 --> 02:50.240
was a new man, ready to take on the world.

02:50.240 --> 02:55.080
But then he posted his 5 part series, which were dark in their presentation and disturbing

02:55.080 --> 03:00.040
in their context, with mental breakdowns, vague foreshadowing language, a far cry from

03:00.040 --> 03:04.960
his initially rather innocent child friendly content of his meme synopsis videos.

03:04.960 --> 03:09.040
This understandably had people concerned, eventually at the end of this 5 part series,

03:09.040 --> 03:10.880
a fellow to say he was staged.

03:10.880 --> 03:14.740
This has understandably caused a whirlwind of reactions within the community, ranging

03:14.740 --> 03:16.600
from sympathy to criticism.

03:16.600 --> 03:20.360
What we're going to do today is break it all down, because honestly, it is an absolute

03:20.360 --> 03:24.980
clusterfuck and it's hard to work out who's right, who's wrong, and if anyone is right

03:24.980 --> 03:25.980
to be honest.

03:25.980 --> 03:29.700
Today I have a lot of questions that many people have, why did this happen, why did

03:29.700 --> 03:34.520
the innocent meme reviewer end up in what must be some sort of delusional state of mind,

03:34.520 --> 03:38.480
what were the causes of this, were these causes justified, how could such a cheerful person

03:38.480 --> 03:42.960
so intent on spreading knowledge turn into one of the most twisted characters online?

03:43.280 --> 03:47.560
I also want to precursor with the usual statement, that although it's important to be sympathetic

03:47.560 --> 03:51.720
to anyone's mental conditions as they may influence their behaviour, it equally doesn't

03:51.720 --> 03:55.960
alleviate actions, as a public figure, they ensure responsibility that is enabled by their

03:55.960 --> 03:56.960
fan base.

03:56.960 --> 04:01.600
I will be criticising the actions on an observational basis, what I see, and what I think, I don't

04:01.600 --> 04:04.880
think I have too much to add, but there's a lot to discuss, so we might as well get

04:04.880 --> 04:07.120
into it.

04:07.120 --> 04:10.480
Do you ever wonder the meaning of today's popular memes?

04:10.480 --> 04:13.160
Do you wonder about the history of some of the classics?

04:13.160 --> 04:17.680
Do you sometimes feel left out when you see others using a term you've never heard before?

04:17.680 --> 04:19.840
Don't worry, we have you covered.

04:19.840 --> 04:24.080
In his Draw My Life video, Kyle, which is what I'll call him when addressing him personally,

04:24.080 --> 04:29.140
noted that he was drawn to make a meme review channel during the Harambe craze, where people

04:29.140 --> 04:34.060
were wondering what the meme was about exactly, something that crossed all of our minds undoubtedly

04:34.060 --> 04:35.600
during the discovery of memes.

04:35.600 --> 04:39.980
I think this is an interesting element, his channel was born out of something innate,

04:39.980 --> 04:44.340
a curiosity that was found in many other people, which is arguably why it rose so quickly,

04:44.340 --> 04:47.340
because his videos almost encompassed a growing curiosity.

04:47.340 --> 04:52.200
Now if we are to pull up the Google trend mechanism, we can see that if we date behind

04:52.200 --> 04:57.420
the memes channel inception at around August 2016, as a trend, memes were about to reach

04:57.420 --> 04:58.420
their peak.

04:58.420 --> 05:02.560
Now trends themselves encompass information very interestingly, because for me, a trend

05:02.560 --> 05:04.460
like anything has phases.

05:04.460 --> 05:08.420
Now there may be a scientific theory behind this, but let me just formulate my own hypothesis

05:08.420 --> 05:09.700
to simplify it.

05:09.700 --> 05:13.180
We have a phase of ignorance where we don't know anything about the topic, the discovery

05:13.180 --> 05:17.780
phase where we're exposed to the topic, and then we have the rejection or assimilation

05:17.780 --> 05:22.060
phase, where we either choose not to pursue such culture, or we throw ourselves in there.

05:22.060 --> 05:26.420
What may follow afterwards, which isn't really documented here, is the forgetting phase,

05:26.420 --> 05:28.900
which is where people begin to withdraw from such a topic.

05:28.900 --> 05:34.080
Now memes is such a general culture that it's unlikely to die soon, however the specific

05:34.080 --> 05:36.220
memes do have that.

05:36.220 --> 05:40.060
These are all important factors to consider, because at the time that behind the memes

05:40.060 --> 05:44.580
started up, we can see that the trend search for memes was heading in an upward projection.

05:44.580 --> 05:49.900
If we were to apply my theory, an upward trend can only occur if more people are in the discovery

05:49.900 --> 05:50.900
phase.

05:50.900 --> 05:55.180
Now the discovery phase is marked by the transition from ignorance to knowledge, and people being

05:55.180 --> 05:58.220
interested, but not really knowing where to start.

05:58.220 --> 06:02.520
Now at that stage, many people need entry level understandings of memes, and I know

06:02.520 --> 06:06.560
I'm talking about it like it's a fine art, but there is a craft to it, and these things

06:06.560 --> 06:11.200
often exist on tiers, even when they're particularly subtle, so we're witnessing an influx of

06:11.200 --> 06:15.740
people into this culture, and that's partly why behind the meme works so well, it was

06:15.740 --> 06:19.800
aided by the fact that he started his channel during one of the most fertile periods for

06:19.800 --> 06:24.160
these memes, and honestly, I watched the Harambe video, and although the production values

06:24.160 --> 06:30.560
were fairly cheap, as videos in general go, it didn't seem bad, it was a fairly easy

06:30.560 --> 06:35.280
video to open with, he was dealing with something that he knew people felt, and as channels

06:35.280 --> 06:40.240
go that aid the discovery phase, it was tonally consistent in its presentation, it was simple,

06:40.240 --> 06:44.280
it was straightforward, it had a demographic, and it knew its demographic like the back

06:44.280 --> 06:48.560
of its hand, bright colours, a high energy voice, which we'll discuss more later, he

06:48.560 --> 06:52.720
knew exactly who he was appealing to, the sort of people who wanted an explanation in

06:52.720 --> 06:58.000
the most reduced fashion, we're not necessarily interested in dissecting the intricacies.

06:58.000 --> 07:01.960
The other thing that we noticed by looking at Google Trends is that even though its gradient

07:01.960 --> 07:07.000
was going upwards, it was already a strongly established genre, with a committed fanbase,

07:07.000 --> 07:11.000
now memes differ in their size and longevity on the platform, and there are some memes

07:11.000 --> 07:15.680
that still have relevance today in our conversations, some memes that outlast the rest, I want you

07:15.680 --> 07:19.880
to hold this thought. Going back to the discovery phase, typically the memes that we discover

07:19.880 --> 07:23.820
are the most popular rather than the most modern, now it's true that a modern meme

07:23.820 --> 07:27.920
may be popular at the same time, but there will always be ones that are more iconic,

07:27.920 --> 07:32.120
this is important as what behind the meme tended to do was go back to a lot of popular

07:32.120 --> 07:36.740
old memes that may have existed before Harambe and cover them while the landscape was a tad

07:36.740 --> 07:41.920
dry, whether it was Dat Boi, a meme from May 2016 a few months before, or even ones that

07:41.920 --> 07:47.880
were a few years before, like Doge, which I'm not gonna call Doge, I think that's

07:47.880 --> 07:53.460
frankly disgraceful, thank you, pronounce it Doge, don't put pineapples on pizza, two

07:53.460 --> 07:59.340
simple principles, and I don't wanna hear it again Mr Bryce. Anyhow, Doge came from

07:59.340 --> 08:03.980
2013 and he was covering it, this was a smart business move on his behalf, he knew which

08:03.980 --> 08:08.180
topics to choose to keep the fans coming back for more, and how to draw in people who had

08:08.180 --> 08:12.620
just discovered the wondrous concept of the meme. As mentioned earlier, behind the meme

08:12.620 --> 08:17.460
was as inoffensive as the channels came, in fact Kyle seemed a fairly harmless person

08:17.460 --> 08:21.700
just trying to provide an insight on the source of a meme, and this was an inherently positive

08:21.700 --> 08:26.500
facet for a channel like his, he was completely out of the drama, how could someone like behind

08:26.500 --> 08:30.940
the meme end up in drama? He also distanced himself from any other form of commentary

08:30.940 --> 08:35.580
and didn't think to comment on such affairs. Now I will explain why this eventually came

08:35.580 --> 08:39.580
back to hurt him, but being an independent creator allowed him to just hustle away on

08:39.580 --> 08:44.780
his own, spreading memes to people who were probably drifting too with regards to content.

08:44.780 --> 08:49.160
Behind the meme almost branded himself as a semi-commercial channel, many people compared

08:49.160 --> 08:55.420
Kyle to a WatchMojo, as epitomised by that energetic commercial voice, and this is definitely

08:55.420 --> 09:00.600
not an unwarranted comparison, but he did attempt to build a closer brand with his viewers,

09:00.600 --> 09:04.080
whereas WatchMojo kind of accepted that most of their viewers are gonna be in and out,

09:04.080 --> 09:08.600
he did attempt to build a stronger bond, often trying to integrate a few more jokes, even

09:08.600 --> 09:12.500
though they were a bit shit, and side comments that would establish his character, almost

09:12.500 --> 09:17.840
trying to mimic Matthew Santoro, another creator who tried to integrate fairly generic ideas

09:17.840 --> 09:21.980
with his own persona. Admittedly he didn't quite do it as well, lacking facecam just

09:21.980 --> 09:25.940
kind of mutes the delivery on such expressive comments, but I can understand what he was

09:25.940 --> 09:30.240
going for, and for a while it definitely worked for some people, his first video on Harambe

09:30.240 --> 09:35.260
was just a basic explanation, with every video he tried to extend it and make it a bit longer

09:35.260 --> 09:38.680
and taking the moments to add those extra bits of banter.

09:38.680 --> 09:44.440
Fast food, America's favourite pastime, next to apple pie, baseball, and watching

09:44.440 --> 09:48.480
porn, you better clear your search history before your mom comes into the room.

09:48.480 --> 09:53.220
We have this channel that had this huge backlog of timeless memes, and a consistent style

09:53.220 --> 09:58.460
and presentation and clear theme, it was an algorithms dream, so it jumped from strength

09:58.460 --> 10:02.920
to strength, while at the same time you had this guy at the helm, although not overflowing

10:02.920 --> 10:06.800
with personality, quirky enough, he could bring an audience back, and he had tapped

10:06.800 --> 10:11.240
in trends that were on the rise, all of these things carried him forward, and by being a

10:11.240 --> 10:15.500
very placid fellow, it seemed impossible that anyone would want to hate him for what

10:15.500 --> 10:19.640
he was doing, I mean, it was completely harmless, was it not?

10:19.640 --> 10:24.120
The content may have been simple, but who cares, it was helping people discover memes,

10:24.120 --> 10:28.920
how could anyone ever stop someone when all they're doing is entertaining others?

10:28.920 --> 10:33.840
Well let's talk about culture, MOTHERFUCKERS, right, so how on earth could someone like

10:33.840 --> 10:40.240
behind the meme ever attract hate, he's wholesome, friendly, and completely harmless, or is he?

10:40.240 --> 10:45.120
Now he hasn't touched any kids, hasn't made any racist tweets, and he certainly hasn't

10:45.120 --> 10:50.080
sold any unreasonably priced Christmas calendars, so what the hell happened?

10:50.080 --> 10:55.920
One word, commentary, you see, in commentary, we're a bunch of judgemental bastards, that's

10:55.920 --> 11:00.880
not always a bad thing, but oh my god was behind the meme the epitome behind the notion

11:00.880 --> 11:05.500
that no channel is beyond the concept of criticism, and that you can't just masquerade yourself

11:05.500 --> 11:09.960
with a friendly persona to escape it, but how did people root out criticism out of something

11:09.960 --> 11:11.800
so perceptively objective?

11:11.800 --> 11:16.480
Well to do that we have to understand culture, without fundamental concepts of value, everything

11:16.480 --> 11:21.600
is subjective, and as abstracts they still are to an extent, however once culture embeds

11:21.600 --> 11:26.920
ideas with them, they can obtain relative levels of success, to take an example is maths,

11:26.920 --> 11:29.680
or math as you american twats call it.

11:29.680 --> 11:34.160
Maths make sense because we have assigned clear values to numbers, we have rationalised

11:34.160 --> 11:37.200
them through culture, and this is important.

11:37.200 --> 11:41.760
Now I'm not saying that culture is just this completely social construct, it may come from

11:41.760 --> 11:46.960
evolutionary traits, but the point is that from these basic fundamental premises yield

11:46.960 --> 11:51.080
many different cultures, and each of them are based in different ideas that set up what

11:51.080 --> 11:56.000
is viewed as acceptable and what isn't, and that's typically a good thing, however this

11:56.000 --> 12:01.860
competition does create something more objective, and that's how successful a culture is, with

12:01.860 --> 12:07.260
regards to its premises, how well the people are doing in it, relative to not just themselves

12:07.260 --> 12:08.780
but to other cultures.

12:08.780 --> 12:13.620
In Emplemon's video you can see how clearly he contrasts the culture of what he calls

12:13.620 --> 12:18.780
outsiders, people who are well educated in the notion of the meme, with normies, the

12:18.780 --> 12:20.060
people who aren't.

12:20.060 --> 12:25.180
The normies are, and have always been, the majority, the mainstream, the hump of the

12:25.180 --> 12:26.180
bell curve.

12:26.180 --> 12:30.380
The outsiders include anyone who rejects mainstream media in favour of content which matches their

12:30.380 --> 12:33.260
more niche and unconventional tastes.

12:33.260 --> 12:37.700
In the 80s, the outsiders were mocked and outcast by the normies, only able to seek

12:37.700 --> 12:41.060
safety in the odd comic book store or sci-fi convention.

12:41.060 --> 12:46.400
Now based on this, quote outsider culture as a generality probably has its aims.

12:46.400 --> 12:51.220
These aims are subjective to the normies, however these are the aims that unite people

12:51.220 --> 12:56.020
into this culture, and this is the one thing that behind the meme didn't understand, that

12:56.020 --> 13:01.060
there was a culture, and that to many people his videos contradicted that culture.

13:01.060 --> 13:05.460
To the casual observer, it was just a guy talking about memes, to someone like Emplemon

13:05.460 --> 13:10.180
it was an assault on everything that he stood for as a proud memer, and he had to send a

13:10.180 --> 13:14.660
message to everyone who didn't understand what he felt, so he made that video.

13:14.660 --> 13:18.400
So I just want to take these last few minutes to tie up some loose ends.

13:18.400 --> 13:22.900
First of all I want to say that I do not hate behind the meme, I just hate this idea that

13:22.900 --> 13:27.580
what he's doing is perfectly okay, and that we have some sort of obligation to make sure

13:27.580 --> 13:32.660
that no normie gets left behind, no, he has to understand that there are negative consequences

13:32.660 --> 13:33.660
to what he's doing.

13:33.660 --> 13:39.740
This represents what I'd brand meme patriotism, which sounds kinda bizarre, but let me explain,

13:39.740 --> 13:44.020
there's a culture that many people believe is the best way to go, it creates the best

13:44.020 --> 13:49.260
memes, creates the best banter in a majority of their opinions, and people are happy with

13:49.260 --> 13:50.260
it.

13:50.260 --> 13:53.800
And then you have someone like behind the meme coming in and executing the ideas in

13:53.800 --> 13:58.140
a different way that contradicts how people view it, and it's an affront to them, but

13:58.140 --> 14:02.440
most of all it's an affront to the culture in general, and those memers who have always

14:02.440 --> 14:07.380
been ostracised from the normie world now have the same normie world turning up and

14:07.380 --> 14:12.740
trying to co-opt their sacred memes, which is what is part of their identity.

14:12.740 --> 14:17.060
Basically it's meme cultural appropriation, can't believe I just said that, and I'm definitely

14:17.060 --> 14:20.920
exaggerating there, but you get what I'm saying, and because these people entered this

14:20.920 --> 14:24.840
culture and were counter-productive to these values, people felt that their memes were

14:24.840 --> 14:26.340
being affected.

14:26.340 --> 14:29.640
Emblemen's concern was that the quality of these memes was being degraded, and their

14:29.640 --> 14:34.380
lifespan decreased, now I don't think behind the meme as an individual was front and centre

14:34.380 --> 14:38.660
to that idea, and honestly the thought that this guy could somehow ruin the length and

14:38.660 --> 14:44.120
trend of memes seems a bit far-fetched, particularly given how memes had a variability, but I can

14:44.120 --> 14:48.440
see when applying these standards that behind the meme does run counter-intuitively to those

14:48.440 --> 14:49.960
cultural fundamentals.

14:49.960 --> 14:55.000
Emblemen's video arguably did over dramatise the implications, but as a comprehensive criticism

14:55.000 --> 14:59.120
of content it served its purpose fairly well, and that's what commentary is, it was the

14:59.120 --> 15:03.400
same with Jinx, same with Lele Pons, on the surface they never did anything obscenely

15:03.400 --> 15:08.600
awful, but make content that by our standards was bad, but when you look deeper people feel

15:08.600 --> 15:13.920
that content like that, behind the meme included, has implications on how culture is viewed,

15:13.920 --> 15:18.200
how people engage with it themselves, and how that conflicts with their views, and how

15:18.200 --> 15:19.900
that affects their enjoyment.

15:19.900 --> 15:24.320
The commentary community is a savage bunch, and if there's a set of creators who make

15:24.320 --> 15:29.160
what many commentators view as subpar content, and they don't receive criticism, which there

15:29.160 --> 15:33.380
are a few, it's only because those creators have ties to the community, and half the commentators

15:33.380 --> 15:37.040
are also cowardly hypocrites who don't want to upset ties to the creators who they may

15:37.040 --> 15:40.080
be associated with, but don't tell them I said that.

15:40.120 --> 15:45.040
Anyhow, my point is, don't ever believe that the community merely goes after the criminals,

15:45.040 --> 15:48.720
behind the meme is a prime example of that, they went against what had been established

15:48.720 --> 15:51.360
culture and they were torn apart for that.

15:51.360 --> 15:55.080
On top of this, it didn't help that behind the meme's content was as safe and commercial

15:55.080 --> 15:59.520
as it could be, something that meme content is antithetic to, so suddenly the idea that

15:59.520 --> 16:04.260
he used stock photos became an insult, and so many other elements, it's not offensive,

16:04.260 --> 16:08.820
but it's unoriginal, uninspired, generic cookie cutter content, which would make someone who's

16:08.820 --> 16:11.940
ingrained in the culture feel insulted by.

16:11.940 --> 16:15.900
These people who are discovering memes are gonna be introduced to this guy, as some sort

16:15.900 --> 16:25.140
of quote teacher as he likes to brand himself, it's like fraud to some of his harshest critics,

16:25.140 --> 16:29.340
he's selling himself as a connoisseur, but the truth is far from that pitch.

16:29.340 --> 16:33.380
So instead of really having this person who made wholesome, harmless content, people felt

16:33.380 --> 16:37.420
suddenly their meme culture was under attack from people like behind the meme who were

16:37.420 --> 16:42.620
simplifying and misrepresenting their work, commercialising it and essentially normifying

16:42.620 --> 16:43.620
it.

16:43.620 --> 16:48.860
And as many of these people on the website found themselves there because they were alienated

16:48.860 --> 16:53.900
by the same mainstream culture, it was like a kick in the face, it's sentimentally based

16:53.900 --> 16:58.740
argumentation, but I understand it, so what would be a content critique was turned into

16:58.740 --> 17:04.580
an actual movement against a creator for what he represents, the selling out of memes.

17:04.580 --> 17:14.700
And boy, does that open a whole new can of worms for Mr Bryce here.

17:14.700 --> 17:19.200
Now as said, behind the meme so desperately tried to avoid involving himself in anything

17:19.200 --> 17:24.340
drama related, so when the drama did finally transpire, he had no clue how to react properly.

17:24.340 --> 17:28.360
M Lemon's video was extremely influential, but he wasn't the first prominent creator

17:28.360 --> 17:29.360
to cover him.

17:29.360 --> 17:33.500
As the Fantano host of the now defunct That Is The Plan, another meme review channel,

17:33.500 --> 17:37.780
made a video satirising behind the meme, touching on its commercialism and lack of

17:37.780 --> 17:55.880
originality and personality.

17:55.880 --> 18:00.420
It was pretty funny, and exactly the sort of bait that only an insecure fool would fall

18:00.420 --> 18:01.420
for.

18:01.420 --> 18:05.780
However, behind the meme is an insecure fool, and trying to respond, placing him in a position

18:05.780 --> 18:07.860
that was completely out of his comfort zone.

18:07.860 --> 18:12.580
Now this already compromised two core elements of him and left him savagely exposed.

18:12.580 --> 18:16.140
As mentioned earlier, he had always tried to create a more personal connection with

18:16.140 --> 18:20.020
his audience, now when combining this with his content, although his personality was

18:20.020 --> 18:24.240
definitely contrived, it was passable, it kinda came with the territory.

18:24.240 --> 18:27.260
When you're stepping out of your comfort zone and responding to someone in a way where

18:27.260 --> 18:30.600
you're not just providing information like your other content, and you're actually

18:30.600 --> 18:34.620
trying to express legitimate argumentative points, you can't just do it in a happy,

18:34.620 --> 18:39.820
jolly tone, especially when trying to convey other emotions, it sounds unhealthy.

18:39.820 --> 18:41.900
So why on earth did he respond like this?

18:41.900 --> 18:45.700
It's the classic problem of being a stranger to criticism for so long.

18:45.700 --> 18:49.680
When we all receive harsh criticism for the first time round, it feels huge, it takes

18:49.680 --> 18:53.580
a massive toll on us, like everything, it just knocks us back, and whenever we face

18:53.580 --> 18:57.100
it down, everything in the moment just seems bigger than it actually is.

18:57.100 --> 19:01.220
We feel it's coming for our reputation and our standing, and we feel the need to defend

19:01.220 --> 19:02.220
ourselves.

19:02.220 --> 19:06.140
With that said, responding to a satire is pretty far-fetched, and through this, Carl

19:06.140 --> 19:10.700
exhibited extensive insecurity in the content that he was making, possibly validating the

19:10.700 --> 19:13.760
criticisms being levelled at him by Fantano.

19:13.760 --> 19:17.420
When you watch a serious Matthew Santoro vid, it's not done with the tone,

19:17.420 --> 19:22.060
Welcome back guys, Matthew Santoro, and today we have to talk about domestic abuse, which

19:22.060 --> 19:25.220
makes me very sad.

19:25.220 --> 19:29.300
The videos are a completely different tone, and they allow Santoro to open up a new side

19:29.300 --> 19:34.140
to the audience, which more successfully builds a relationship than any transfer of persona.

19:34.140 --> 19:38.740
That's what Bryce needed to do, and instead we got this.

19:38.740 --> 19:43.340
In all seriousness, this video was all in good fun, I just had to respond to Anthony's

19:43.340 --> 19:47.820
video because he randomly decided to attack me and my viewers, and I didn't like that.

19:47.820 --> 19:52.600
Jesus Christ, and once M. Lemon and videos that followed from other creators showed up

19:52.600 --> 19:55.800
how fragile his persona was, it put him on borrowed time.

19:55.800 --> 19:58.800
The problem was, he hit a characteristic contradiction.

19:58.800 --> 20:03.100
His tone was too much like a WatchMojo host, as mentioned earlier, and you can't create

20:03.100 --> 20:04.800
a deeper persona for that.

20:04.800 --> 20:08.220
In fact, watching the videos, although he did attempt to deepen his character in ways

20:08.220 --> 20:13.120
we'll address soon, one of the very awkward changes was he progressively upped his persona

20:13.120 --> 20:14.120
to 11.

20:14.120 --> 20:15.720
If we go from one of his first videos...

20:15.720 --> 20:19.760
Hello internet, and welcome to Behind The Meme, where we take a look at the meaning

20:19.760 --> 20:22.460
and the origin of your favourite memes.

20:22.460 --> 20:23.960
Today we have a look at Dodge.

20:23.960 --> 20:24.960
To this...

20:24.960 --> 20:29.960
Hello internet, and welcome to Behind The Meme.

20:29.960 --> 20:33.140
Today we have a look at Gru's plan.

20:33.140 --> 20:37.040
The only change is the increasingly insipid tone.

20:37.040 --> 20:41.640
He seems to have wrongly attributed his quirky persona to the success of the channel, and

20:41.640 --> 20:47.080
he so continues to up the gears, and it becomes nauseating and so transparently fake.

20:47.080 --> 20:49.960
This will become particularly problematic for your viewer base, who are going to be

20:49.960 --> 20:54.200
drawn in by your rather juvenile tone, because they'll inevitably grow out of it.

20:54.200 --> 20:57.680
In spite of the criticisms, the least you could say is that your Harambe video could

20:57.680 --> 21:00.000
be watched by people of all ages.

21:00.000 --> 21:03.800
Any of the newer stuff seems specifically aimed at the youngest denomination who will

21:03.800 --> 21:05.680
never stick around anyway.

21:05.680 --> 21:09.860
What inflames this scenario is the zeitgeist, as said multiple times before, this was the

21:09.860 --> 21:13.960
era where happy-go-lucky personas died.

21:13.960 --> 21:18.380
We want brooding, deeper characters, and his persona became outdated very quickly.

21:18.380 --> 21:22.260
Equally, when trying to develop character, he often turned to a very sensitive topic

21:22.260 --> 21:26.700
like Stefan Karl, and once again, I can't look into a person's mind and decipher their

21:26.700 --> 21:30.620
motivations for making a video like that, but it seemed more of a way to prove that

21:30.620 --> 21:34.700
he was a good guy, and although I don't necessarily think showing that you're a kind person is

21:34.700 --> 21:39.660
a bad thing, if you go out of your way to make videos that divert from your normal style,

21:39.660 --> 21:45.340
and on top of it, immediately after you receive criticism, as documented by my best mate Pyro,

21:45.340 --> 22:08.020
it seems rather insincere.

22:08.020 --> 22:12.140
It doesn't seem like character development, it seems like a construction of what he wants

22:12.140 --> 22:17.460
people to see, the topics of your videos should not solely be dictating your character, however,

22:17.460 --> 22:20.900
none of this mattered as long as he was still pulling views.

22:20.900 --> 22:25.780
As noted on my Zoe Burger video, providing you have a positive like to dislike ratio,

22:25.780 --> 22:29.860
your video typically tends to maintain rotation with the YouTube algorithms, if it's on

22:29.860 --> 22:32.220
a trending meme, we're all quids in.

22:32.220 --> 22:37.100
You see, in a way, behind the meme situation, Ag created a very strange dynamic, the criticism

22:37.100 --> 22:41.980
from commentators like Emp, Fantano, and Pyro, meant that there was this sway of the

22:41.980 --> 22:47.100
people who were completely out for blood whenever he uploaded, he gained a level of infamy,

22:47.100 --> 22:50.980
equally though, if he could reach beyond there and hit a demographic of casual viewers, he'd

22:50.980 --> 22:54.780
probably be able to alleviate the hatred, as those people aren't really concerned

22:54.780 --> 22:58.420
with the culture, and at first, this seemed to be the case, he seemed to be able to scrape

22:58.420 --> 23:03.220
the views to keep a positive ratio over those who were vehemently against him.

23:03.220 --> 23:08.420
However, barely a year after all this had began, in August, the dislikes began to win

23:08.420 --> 23:11.540
out, and it began to kill him.

23:11.540 --> 23:15.660
Probably one of the most ironic tales to this is that people who he introduced memes to,

23:15.660 --> 23:20.000
who provided him the views and support at the initial stage, then likely were the ones

23:20.000 --> 23:24.980
who became more educated, and were then the ones to come back and contribute to his channel's

23:24.980 --> 23:25.980
demise.

23:25.980 --> 23:29.260
That's the thing, if you're an unassuming citizen discovering memes, then behind the

23:29.260 --> 23:33.140
meme is perfect, once you're in the culture, you don't need him, and in fact, you may

23:33.140 --> 23:34.700
come to loathe him.

23:34.700 --> 23:39.820
Equally, as the popularity of the meme stopped its ascension, he had less people to introduce

23:39.820 --> 23:44.660
it to, and increased accessibility online to memes further meant that he had even less

23:44.660 --> 23:46.280
utility than before.

23:46.280 --> 23:51.060
On top of this, he used his get out of jail free meme cards early on, by covering old

23:51.060 --> 23:55.900
popular more timeless memes already, he had nothing left, and he had to rely on the modern

23:55.900 --> 23:57.520
memes to be popular.

23:57.520 --> 24:00.820
And as Emp rightfully noted, although we've definitely experienced an increase in the

24:00.820 --> 24:05.060
number of memes, and some of them do seem popular in the moment, they're not lasting

24:05.060 --> 24:09.140
the way that many of the older ones did, and that just doesn't bode well for a channel

24:09.140 --> 24:14.240
like behind the meme, the markets had been flooded, his time was up, there was nothing,

24:14.240 --> 24:18.900
his personality gave us nothing, his content gave us nothing, and the audience response

24:18.900 --> 24:22.320
had soured, and the demand had plateaued.

24:22.320 --> 24:27.240
It was a timely death, and eventually after a run with diminishing returns, behind the

24:27.240 --> 24:30.740
meme stopped.

24:30.740 --> 24:32.840
But it wasn't over.

24:37.840 --> 24:43.720
As said, Kyle clearly viewed himself as being able to rebrand, his meme review was dead,

24:43.720 --> 24:48.040
but what if he changed his content, did something else he was passionate about, there were so

24:48.040 --> 24:51.280
many opportunities out there for him that he could pursue.

24:51.280 --> 24:55.560
He made the return video we spoke about, there made a tribute video to Stefan Karl

24:55.560 --> 24:58.480
after his passing, and then came his little series.

24:58.480 --> 25:03.920
Now, I'm not going to detail every single thing, but I am going to give a quick summary,

25:03.920 --> 25:06.940
just so people know what this is about, if you wanna watch the videos, they're still

25:06.940 --> 25:07.940
up on his channel.

25:07.940 --> 25:12.360
It begins with a trip to the store in which he buys the most familiar brand of vodka,

25:12.360 --> 25:15.640
Smirnoff, implying that there will be intoxicated antics occurring.

25:15.640 --> 25:19.960
In his second video he has consumed some vodka, shoots the shit, talks vaguely about the future

25:19.960 --> 25:24.500
of his channel, showing you around his house and making random comments, and so on.

25:24.500 --> 25:28.920
The third episode includes him driving intoxicated, and then talking about some deep stuff while

25:28.920 --> 25:29.920
contemplating.

25:29.920 --> 25:33.240
So here is the character development, we're getting a bit deeper, a bit darker.

25:33.240 --> 25:36.160
Now there are some details that I'm going to leave out, because I think they're important

25:36.160 --> 25:40.880
for the judgement, but you can tell that his tone is changing, and becoming more disturbed.

25:40.880 --> 25:45.920
The fourth episode is more of this, just him back in an indoor environment, crying, drinking

25:45.920 --> 25:47.280
more, and so on.

25:47.560 --> 25:52.200
And the final episode is the fateful moment where he takes his own life, truly tragic.

25:52.200 --> 25:57.420
Of course, it was a ruse, but why did he do something like this, well to prove a point,

25:57.420 --> 26:01.020
he was telling his story of how he felt, and the hate he received.

26:01.020 --> 26:05.400
But through my experience, it caused me to take a step back and have a look at our society

26:05.400 --> 26:06.620
as a whole.

26:06.620 --> 26:11.020
How we treat each other unfairly, how quick we are to turn our backs on another human,

26:11.020 --> 26:15.220
how easily it is to forget we're all in the same boat just trying to get by.

26:15.220 --> 26:19.500
Sadly, all these negative characteristics seem to be amplified on the internet where

26:19.500 --> 26:21.660
people think they are anonymous.

26:21.660 --> 26:25.860
It sucks, but that is how our society seems to conduct itself lately.

26:25.860 --> 26:30.540
It's clear through this, he felt a lot of it was unwarranted, and yielded unnecessary

26:30.540 --> 26:31.780
consequences.

26:31.780 --> 26:32.780
So how do I feel?

26:32.780 --> 26:34.220
Is he right?

26:34.220 --> 26:36.380
Was the hate too much?

26:36.380 --> 26:38.380
Well I think it's a double edged sword.

26:38.380 --> 26:42.100
The problem is, we as public figures have to be prepared to take criticism.

26:42.100 --> 26:45.540
The thing about behind the meme is that he never really dealt criticism.

26:45.540 --> 26:48.020
As he said, he was just spreading positivity.

26:48.020 --> 26:50.580
How can you hate someone for spreading love?

26:50.580 --> 26:55.120
And on one hand, I don't think the hate messages, cruel comments, and so on are justified.

26:55.120 --> 26:59.300
If they're directed in a personal fashion, they're very seldom justified, and I'll stand

26:59.300 --> 27:00.300
by that.

27:00.300 --> 27:03.480
And if you want to challenge them and take them on, then more power to you.

27:03.480 --> 27:08.300
Things like doxing also absolutely terrible, and I think calling out people like that is

27:08.300 --> 27:09.300
reasonable.

27:09.500 --> 27:14.660
And the sort of vague narrative that was constructed through this seems to encompass all the culture

27:14.660 --> 27:18.820
as hate, and whether you meant it to come across that way, the sort of very forced comments

27:18.820 --> 27:22.860
that were inserted in the build up was the one identifiably fake element, although it

27:22.860 --> 27:25.940
was implausible, it was otherwise well done.

27:25.940 --> 27:30.980
Here's the point, as a guy, you may be lovely, you may be delightful, and although some of

27:30.980 --> 27:31.980
M.P.

27:31.980 --> 27:36.680
Lemon's criticism seems slightly doubtful to me, they weren't based in impossible outcomes,

27:36.680 --> 27:41.440
and they were delivered in a way that separated the creator from the content, and they weren't

27:41.440 --> 27:45.240
particularly harsh, although they did imply some strong consequences.

27:45.240 --> 27:49.540
At the end of the video, M.P. even says this himself, that he's not there to hate on behind

27:49.540 --> 27:54.060
the meme of the person, not hate on Kyle, so whether it was Kyle's intention to turn

27:54.060 --> 28:00.280
criticism onto M.P. or Pyro, or anyone else who kind of led this cultural war, or not,

28:00.280 --> 28:04.680
the fans who are interpreting it that way right now really need to think about this.

28:04.680 --> 28:08.920
As creators, we can have a responsibility with how we deal our message.

28:08.920 --> 28:13.440
If we feel someone is making bad content or can do better, we shouldn't hold our tongues.

28:13.440 --> 28:17.280
If we can turn it into a good video, then hell, we should go for it.

28:17.280 --> 28:21.280
I don't know why we wouldn't, and equally, there will always be people who take up a

28:21.280 --> 28:23.280
cause with the sole purpose of hating.

28:23.280 --> 28:28.640
What we need to make sure is that we don't rile people up unnecessarily, I don't think

28:28.640 --> 28:31.860
any of the critics that we spoke about today did that.

28:31.860 --> 28:36.040
Equally M.P. did actually see behind the memes channel as an actual threat to a culture

28:36.040 --> 28:40.460
very intimate to him, of course he was going to make a video on it, he wants to see his

28:40.460 --> 28:45.140
community thrive, behind the meme stood against that to him, and so of course it became a

28:45.140 --> 28:49.720
discourse of what's best for a community, and that's a complex conversation, and people

28:49.720 --> 28:53.740
misinterpret it, but it didn't make his points less valid.

28:53.740 --> 28:58.180
Equally I find the notion of why can't we all just be positive, utterly pretentious,

28:58.180 --> 29:02.660
and everyone knows I've never liked it, criticism isn't always meant to be positive,

29:02.660 --> 29:07.180
imagine that being the case for movies, the transformers films entertained a lot of people,

29:07.180 --> 29:10.860
made a lot of people happy, doesn't mean that people can't find reasonable explanations

29:10.860 --> 29:16.260
to bash on it and deal out criticism, Ray Sremmurd, I am not a fan, but some people

29:16.260 --> 29:20.900
really enjoy it, but it doesn't mean I shouldn't hate it, do I endorse sending hate messages

29:20.900 --> 29:21.900
to the lads?

29:21.900 --> 29:26.520
No, not at all, they're making music, but you have to separate those two elements, or

29:26.520 --> 29:31.520
else it just seems like you're using suicide to get back at your critic, which is never

29:31.520 --> 29:33.100
a good look.

29:33.100 --> 29:36.800
Positivity can be a dangerous fail for very sketchy behaviour, and if you don't go after

29:36.800 --> 29:40.620
someone simply because they seem nice on the surface, you may be looking over some very

29:40.620 --> 29:44.640
seedy business, which there have been many examples of.

29:44.640 --> 29:48.740
Criticism doesn't always make us feel good, but we're not entitled to a bubble of happiness

29:48.740 --> 29:52.760
and smiles, and when I deal criticism, I'll do my best to be honest and fair, but at the

29:52.760 --> 29:58.040
same time, I know someone might still be offended by it, it's down to them to harness that criticism,

29:58.040 --> 30:01.520
and that's something Behind The Meme never did, he never changed his content for the

30:01.520 --> 30:05.120
better, he never listened to what people were saying, and he paid the price for that in

30:05.120 --> 30:06.720
the subsequent ratings.

30:06.720 --> 30:11.020
I can't really feel bad for him on that behalf, at the end of the day, someone made a better

30:11.020 --> 30:15.880
argument for why his content wasn't that good, regardless of who it pleased, or how positive

30:15.880 --> 30:16.880
it was.

30:16.880 --> 30:20.720
Khan was Behind The Meme mostly in the past, and I think that's sensible, it's had its

30:20.720 --> 30:26.120
day, and as concepts, his channel was on its way out regardless, even without the hate.

30:26.120 --> 30:29.880
I don't know if he's gonna have trouble restarting, as I feel like a lot of his critics will stick

30:29.880 --> 30:33.760
around, but maybe we can become familiarised with a different side of a person who we've

30:33.760 --> 30:36.840
really only gone after that one persona in the past.

30:36.840 --> 30:37.880
I feel it's time.

30:37.880 --> 30:39.520
Is Behind The Meme a victim?

30:39.520 --> 30:43.680
It depends how you define victimhood, if being subject to disproportionate hate makes him

30:43.680 --> 30:48.500
a victim, then yeah, he might well be, it seemed unnecessary, but at the same time it's

30:48.500 --> 30:52.300
a consistent principle applied across all realms of commentary.

30:52.300 --> 30:56.180
We've all received death threats, and looking at the actual creators who've criticised

30:56.180 --> 30:59.780
them, they haven't been particularly harsh, and attacking them for merely having narratives

30:59.780 --> 31:02.060
that contradict your image doesn't wash with me.

31:02.060 --> 31:06.580
At the end of the day, they're just creators who wanted you to do your genre more justice,

31:06.580 --> 31:11.460
and I hope that you will keep that in mind when taking your content in a future direction.

31:11.460 --> 31:16.500
So yeah, those are my fairly extensive thoughts on Behind The Meme, interesting bloke, I would

31:16.500 --> 31:19.780

for me.

31:28.660 --> 31:33.540

31:33.540 --> 31:34.940

Anyhow, I don't think I really have too much else to add, I don't know exactly when this

31:51.860 --> 31:56.620
is gonna be out, but I hope it's out in time to at least maintain some of your interest.

31:56.620 --> 31:58.620
Anyhow, we'll just have to find that out.
