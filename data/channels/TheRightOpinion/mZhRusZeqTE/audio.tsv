0	8680	Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with
8680	12720	too much free time, and today we need to take a meme and go behind it.
12720	19160	Wow, I'm so excited, no fuck you, Pyro and M both already did that joke, today's topic
19160	23840	is not going to make you enthusiastic or happy, or anything like Kyle or behind the meme seems
23840	28400	to attempt to or attempted to convey through his videos, no today we're dealing with topics
28400	32120	that aren't inherently happy, so I'm sorry to anyone who came to my channel looking for
32120	36500	a happy smiley person, my life is misery, soon yours will be too.
36500	40800	Because today we're dealing with the tragic tale of behind the meme, and issues surrounding
40800	45640	semantics regarding that, and boy do we have a lot to discuss, because I'm going to be
45640	50320	talking about a lot of concepts, some of them a bit more philosophical even, because I think
50320	54840	it encompasses an interesting element of content creation, and we'll get to that in a bit,
54840	59220	the first behind the meme, who is he to all those who may not be aware of his infamy.
59220	64180	So essentially behind the meme is a meme channel set up by creator Kyle Bryce, don't worry
64180	69000	his name is public, but he brands it as having the intention of educating those who are unfamiliar
69000	73000	with memes, providing the audience with a relatively light explanation of the origin
73000	75220	of the meme and applications of it.
75220	79400	To take a quick example, Harambe, Harambe is a deceased gorilla who eventually became
79400	83280	a meme after the meme connoisseurs decided it would be, and in this instance behind the
83280	88040	meme explains how Harambe has came to be, you know, whole enclosure incident, satirisation
88040	90120	of people's reaction, and so on.
90120	94200	These videos rapidly picked up steam, with views coming in from the first upload.
94200	98520	This wasn't Kyle's first channel, so he knew how to make his video semi-competent, he quickly
98520	102680	upgraded and realised the business opportunity, it was all going right, video after video
102680	106920	was a hit with the audience, and he was flying high with a group of people who had his back.
106920	110760	Yet fast forward less than 2 and a half years later, and it's almost like we've stepped
110760	114840	into a different dimension, the happy colourful behind the meme is gone, and in its place
114840	120200	is a shell, a shell that is the draw of multiple controversies over the span of just over a year.
120200	124320	Well, after a spell where his videos were performing abysmally with views and ratings
124320	126040	alike, he took a break.
126040	130040	Now we'll delve into the details of why this flatlined in a bit, stay patient my friends,
130040	134160	however with every break came the return, and behind the meme came back to a fanfare
134160	138520	of broken brass, however the video he posted, what happened to behind the meme, seemed to
138520	143280	represent a perspective of hope, one in which he had been dragged down by so much, but now
143280	146800	he was in a better place, ready not to fumble this situation.
146800	150360	But I have done a tremendous amount of growing over the last few months while away from this
150360	154340	channel, growing that has only been able to happen thanks to the luxuries YouTube has
154340	155380	afforded me.
155380	159160	This personal development wouldn't have happened had I not taken a bit of time to myself to
159160	162520	attempt to discover who I am and what happiness means to me.
162520	166840	He had almost 800,000 subscribers, most of us will never receive that opportunity, he
166840	170240	was a new man, ready to take on the world.
170240	175080	But then he posted his 5 part series, which were dark in their presentation and disturbing
175080	180040	in their context, with mental breakdowns, vague foreshadowing language, a far cry from
180040	184960	his initially rather innocent child friendly content of his meme synopsis videos.
184960	189040	This understandably had people concerned, eventually at the end of this 5 part series,
189040	190880	a fellow to say he was staged.
190880	194740	This has understandably caused a whirlwind of reactions within the community, ranging
194740	196600	from sympathy to criticism.
196600	200360	What we're going to do today is break it all down, because honestly, it is an absolute
200360	204980	clusterfuck and it's hard to work out who's right, who's wrong, and if anyone is right
204980	205980	to be honest.
205980	209700	Today I have a lot of questions that many people have, why did this happen, why did
209700	214520	the innocent meme reviewer end up in what must be some sort of delusional state of mind,
214520	218480	what were the causes of this, were these causes justified, how could such a cheerful person
218480	222960	so intent on spreading knowledge turn into one of the most twisted characters online?
223280	227560	I also want to precursor with the usual statement, that although it's important to be sympathetic
227560	231720	to anyone's mental conditions as they may influence their behaviour, it equally doesn't
231720	235960	alleviate actions, as a public figure, they ensure responsibility that is enabled by their
235960	236960	fan base.
236960	241600	I will be criticising the actions on an observational basis, what I see, and what I think, I don't
241600	244880	think I have too much to add, but there's a lot to discuss, so we might as well get
244880	247120	into it.
247120	250480	Do you ever wonder the meaning of today's popular memes?
250480	253160	Do you wonder about the history of some of the classics?
253160	257680	Do you sometimes feel left out when you see others using a term you've never heard before?
257680	259840	Don't worry, we have you covered.
259840	264080	In his Draw My Life video, Kyle, which is what I'll call him when addressing him personally,
264080	269140	noted that he was drawn to make a meme review channel during the Harambe craze, where people
269140	274060	were wondering what the meme was about exactly, something that crossed all of our minds undoubtedly
274060	275600	during the discovery of memes.
275600	279980	I think this is an interesting element, his channel was born out of something innate,
279980	284340	a curiosity that was found in many other people, which is arguably why it rose so quickly,
284340	287340	because his videos almost encompassed a growing curiosity.
287340	292200	Now if we are to pull up the Google trend mechanism, we can see that if we date behind
292200	297420	the memes channel inception at around August 2016, as a trend, memes were about to reach
297420	298420	their peak.
298420	302560	Now trends themselves encompass information very interestingly, because for me, a trend
302560	304460	like anything has phases.
304460	308420	Now there may be a scientific theory behind this, but let me just formulate my own hypothesis
308420	309700	to simplify it.
309700	313180	We have a phase of ignorance where we don't know anything about the topic, the discovery
313180	317780	phase where we're exposed to the topic, and then we have the rejection or assimilation
317780	322060	phase, where we either choose not to pursue such culture, or we throw ourselves in there.
322060	326420	What may follow afterwards, which isn't really documented here, is the forgetting phase,
326420	328900	which is where people begin to withdraw from such a topic.
328900	334080	Now memes is such a general culture that it's unlikely to die soon, however the specific
334080	336220	memes do have that.
336220	340060	These are all important factors to consider, because at the time that behind the memes
340060	344580	started up, we can see that the trend search for memes was heading in an upward projection.
344580	349900	If we were to apply my theory, an upward trend can only occur if more people are in the discovery
349900	350900	phase.
350900	355180	Now the discovery phase is marked by the transition from ignorance to knowledge, and people being
355180	358220	interested, but not really knowing where to start.
358220	362520	Now at that stage, many people need entry level understandings of memes, and I know
362520	366560	I'm talking about it like it's a fine art, but there is a craft to it, and these things
366560	371200	often exist on tiers, even when they're particularly subtle, so we're witnessing an influx of
371200	375740	people into this culture, and that's partly why behind the meme works so well, it was
375740	379800	aided by the fact that he started his channel during one of the most fertile periods for
379800	384160	these memes, and honestly, I watched the Harambe video, and although the production values
384160	390560	were fairly cheap, as videos in general go, it didn't seem bad, it was a fairly easy
390560	395280	video to open with, he was dealing with something that he knew people felt, and as channels
395280	400240	go that aid the discovery phase, it was tonally consistent in its presentation, it was simple,
400240	404280	it was straightforward, it had a demographic, and it knew its demographic like the back
404280	408560	of its hand, bright colours, a high energy voice, which we'll discuss more later, he
408560	412720	knew exactly who he was appealing to, the sort of people who wanted an explanation in
412720	418000	the most reduced fashion, we're not necessarily interested in dissecting the intricacies.
418000	421960	The other thing that we noticed by looking at Google Trends is that even though its gradient
421960	427000	was going upwards, it was already a strongly established genre, with a committed fanbase,
427000	431000	now memes differ in their size and longevity on the platform, and there are some memes
431000	435680	that still have relevance today in our conversations, some memes that outlast the rest, I want you
435680	439880	to hold this thought. Going back to the discovery phase, typically the memes that we discover
439880	443820	are the most popular rather than the most modern, now it's true that a modern meme
443820	447920	may be popular at the same time, but there will always be ones that are more iconic,
447920	452120	this is important as what behind the meme tended to do was go back to a lot of popular
452120	456740	old memes that may have existed before Harambe and cover them while the landscape was a tad
456740	461920	dry, whether it was Dat Boi, a meme from May 2016 a few months before, or even ones that
461920	467880	were a few years before, like Doge, which I'm not gonna call Doge, I think that's
467880	473460	frankly disgraceful, thank you, pronounce it Doge, don't put pineapples on pizza, two
473460	479340	simple principles, and I don't wanna hear it again Mr Bryce. Anyhow, Doge came from
479340	483980	2013 and he was covering it, this was a smart business move on his behalf, he knew which
483980	488180	topics to choose to keep the fans coming back for more, and how to draw in people who had
488180	492620	just discovered the wondrous concept of the meme. As mentioned earlier, behind the meme
492620	497460	was as inoffensive as the channels came, in fact Kyle seemed a fairly harmless person
497460	501700	just trying to provide an insight on the source of a meme, and this was an inherently positive
501700	506500	facet for a channel like his, he was completely out of the drama, how could someone like behind
506500	510940	the meme end up in drama? He also distanced himself from any other form of commentary
510940	515580	and didn't think to comment on such affairs. Now I will explain why this eventually came
515580	519580	back to hurt him, but being an independent creator allowed him to just hustle away on
519580	524780	his own, spreading memes to people who were probably drifting too with regards to content.
524780	529160	Behind the meme almost branded himself as a semi-commercial channel, many people compared
529160	535420	Kyle to a WatchMojo, as epitomised by that energetic commercial voice, and this is definitely
535420	540600	not an unwarranted comparison, but he did attempt to build a closer brand with his viewers,
540600	544080	whereas WatchMojo kind of accepted that most of their viewers are gonna be in and out,
544080	548600	he did attempt to build a stronger bond, often trying to integrate a few more jokes, even
548600	552500	though they were a bit shit, and side comments that would establish his character, almost
552500	557840	trying to mimic Matthew Santoro, another creator who tried to integrate fairly generic ideas
557840	561980	with his own persona. Admittedly he didn't quite do it as well, lacking facecam just
561980	565940	kind of mutes the delivery on such expressive comments, but I can understand what he was
565940	570240	going for, and for a while it definitely worked for some people, his first video on Harambe
570240	575260	was just a basic explanation, with every video he tried to extend it and make it a bit longer
575260	578680	and taking the moments to add those extra bits of banter.
578680	584440	Fast food, America's favourite pastime, next to apple pie, baseball, and watching
584440	588480	porn, you better clear your search history before your mom comes into the room.
588480	593220	We have this channel that had this huge backlog of timeless memes, and a consistent style
593220	598460	and presentation and clear theme, it was an algorithms dream, so it jumped from strength
598460	602920	to strength, while at the same time you had this guy at the helm, although not overflowing
602920	606800	with personality, quirky enough, he could bring an audience back, and he had tapped
606800	611240	in trends that were on the rise, all of these things carried him forward, and by being a
611240	615500	very placid fellow, it seemed impossible that anyone would want to hate him for what
615500	619640	he was doing, I mean, it was completely harmless, was it not?
619640	624120	The content may have been simple, but who cares, it was helping people discover memes,
624120	628920	how could anyone ever stop someone when all they're doing is entertaining others?
628920	633840	Well let's talk about culture, MOTHERFUCKERS, right, so how on earth could someone like
633840	640240	behind the meme ever attract hate, he's wholesome, friendly, and completely harmless, or is he?
640240	645120	Now he hasn't touched any kids, hasn't made any racist tweets, and he certainly hasn't
645120	650080	sold any unreasonably priced Christmas calendars, so what the hell happened?
650080	655920	One word, commentary, you see, in commentary, we're a bunch of judgemental bastards, that's
655920	660880	not always a bad thing, but oh my god was behind the meme the epitome behind the notion
660880	665500	that no channel is beyond the concept of criticism, and that you can't just masquerade yourself
665500	669960	with a friendly persona to escape it, but how did people root out criticism out of something
669960	671800	so perceptively objective?
671800	676480	Well to do that we have to understand culture, without fundamental concepts of value, everything
676480	681600	is subjective, and as abstracts they still are to an extent, however once culture embeds
681600	686920	ideas with them, they can obtain relative levels of success, to take an example is maths,
686920	689680	or math as you american twats call it.
689680	694160	Maths make sense because we have assigned clear values to numbers, we have rationalised
694160	697200	them through culture, and this is important.
697200	701760	Now I'm not saying that culture is just this completely social construct, it may come from
701760	706960	evolutionary traits, but the point is that from these basic fundamental premises yield
706960	711080	many different cultures, and each of them are based in different ideas that set up what
711080	716000	is viewed as acceptable and what isn't, and that's typically a good thing, however this
716000	721860	competition does create something more objective, and that's how successful a culture is, with
721860	727260	regards to its premises, how well the people are doing in it, relative to not just themselves
727260	728780	but to other cultures.
728780	733620	In Emplemon's video you can see how clearly he contrasts the culture of what he calls
733620	738780	outsiders, people who are well educated in the notion of the meme, with normies, the
738780	740060	people who aren't.
740060	745180	The normies are, and have always been, the majority, the mainstream, the hump of the
745180	746180	bell curve.
746180	750380	The outsiders include anyone who rejects mainstream media in favour of content which matches their
750380	753260	more niche and unconventional tastes.
753260	757700	In the 80s, the outsiders were mocked and outcast by the normies, only able to seek
757700	761060	safety in the odd comic book store or sci-fi convention.
761060	766400	Now based on this, quote outsider culture as a generality probably has its aims.
766400	771220	These aims are subjective to the normies, however these are the aims that unite people
771220	776020	into this culture, and this is the one thing that behind the meme didn't understand, that
776020	781060	there was a culture, and that to many people his videos contradicted that culture.
781060	785460	To the casual observer, it was just a guy talking about memes, to someone like Emplemon
785460	790180	it was an assault on everything that he stood for as a proud memer, and he had to send a
790180	794660	message to everyone who didn't understand what he felt, so he made that video.
794660	798400	So I just want to take these last few minutes to tie up some loose ends.
798400	802900	First of all I want to say that I do not hate behind the meme, I just hate this idea that
802900	807580	what he's doing is perfectly okay, and that we have some sort of obligation to make sure
807580	812660	that no normie gets left behind, no, he has to understand that there are negative consequences
812660	813660	to what he's doing.
813660	819740	This represents what I'd brand meme patriotism, which sounds kinda bizarre, but let me explain,
819740	824020	there's a culture that many people believe is the best way to go, it creates the best
824020	829260	memes, creates the best banter in a majority of their opinions, and people are happy with
829260	830260	it.
830260	833800	And then you have someone like behind the meme coming in and executing the ideas in
833800	838140	a different way that contradicts how people view it, and it's an affront to them, but
838140	842440	most of all it's an affront to the culture in general, and those memers who have always
842440	847380	been ostracised from the normie world now have the same normie world turning up and
847380	852740	trying to co-opt their sacred memes, which is what is part of their identity.
852740	857060	Basically it's meme cultural appropriation, can't believe I just said that, and I'm definitely
857060	860920	exaggerating there, but you get what I'm saying, and because these people entered this
860920	864840	culture and were counter-productive to these values, people felt that their memes were
864840	866340	being affected.
866340	869640	Emblemen's concern was that the quality of these memes was being degraded, and their
869640	874380	lifespan decreased, now I don't think behind the meme as an individual was front and centre
874380	878660	to that idea, and honestly the thought that this guy could somehow ruin the length and
878660	884120	trend of memes seems a bit far-fetched, particularly given how memes had a variability, but I can
884120	888440	see when applying these standards that behind the meme does run counter-intuitively to those
888440	889960	cultural fundamentals.
889960	895000	Emblemen's video arguably did over dramatise the implications, but as a comprehensive criticism
895000	899120	of content it served its purpose fairly well, and that's what commentary is, it was the
899120	903400	same with Jinx, same with Lele Pons, on the surface they never did anything obscenely
903400	908600	awful, but make content that by our standards was bad, but when you look deeper people feel
908600	913920	that content like that, behind the meme included, has implications on how culture is viewed,
913920	918200	how people engage with it themselves, and how that conflicts with their views, and how
918200	919900	that affects their enjoyment.
919900	924320	The commentary community is a savage bunch, and if there's a set of creators who make
924320	929160	what many commentators view as subpar content, and they don't receive criticism, which there
929160	933380	are a few, it's only because those creators have ties to the community, and half the commentators
933380	937040	are also cowardly hypocrites who don't want to upset ties to the creators who they may
937040	940080	be associated with, but don't tell them I said that.
940120	945040	Anyhow, my point is, don't ever believe that the community merely goes after the criminals,
945040	948720	behind the meme is a prime example of that, they went against what had been established
948720	951360	culture and they were torn apart for that.
951360	955080	On top of this, it didn't help that behind the meme's content was as safe and commercial
955080	959520	as it could be, something that meme content is antithetic to, so suddenly the idea that
959520	964260	he used stock photos became an insult, and so many other elements, it's not offensive,
964260	968820	but it's unoriginal, uninspired, generic cookie cutter content, which would make someone who's
968820	971940	ingrained in the culture feel insulted by.
971940	975900	These people who are discovering memes are gonna be introduced to this guy, as some sort
975900	985140	of quote teacher as he likes to brand himself, it's like fraud to some of his harshest critics,
985140	989340	he's selling himself as a connoisseur, but the truth is far from that pitch.
989340	993380	So instead of really having this person who made wholesome, harmless content, people felt
993380	997420	suddenly their meme culture was under attack from people like behind the meme who were
997420	1002620	simplifying and misrepresenting their work, commercialising it and essentially normifying
1002620	1003620	it.
1003620	1008860	And as many of these people on the website found themselves there because they were alienated
1008860	1013900	by the same mainstream culture, it was like a kick in the face, it's sentimentally based
1013900	1018740	argumentation, but I understand it, so what would be a content critique was turned into
1018740	1024580	an actual movement against a creator for what he represents, the selling out of memes.
1024580	1034700	And boy, does that open a whole new can of worms for Mr Bryce here.
1034700	1039200	Now as said, behind the meme so desperately tried to avoid involving himself in anything
1039200	1044340	drama related, so when the drama did finally transpire, he had no clue how to react properly.
1044340	1048360	M Lemon's video was extremely influential, but he wasn't the first prominent creator
1048360	1049360	to cover him.
1049360	1053500	As the Fantano host of the now defunct That Is The Plan, another meme review channel,
1053500	1057780	made a video satirising behind the meme, touching on its commercialism and lack of
1057780	1075880	originality and personality.
1075880	1080420	It was pretty funny, and exactly the sort of bait that only an insecure fool would fall
1080420	1081420	for.
1081420	1085780	However, behind the meme is an insecure fool, and trying to respond, placing him in a position
1085780	1087860	that was completely out of his comfort zone.
1087860	1092580	Now this already compromised two core elements of him and left him savagely exposed.
1092580	1096140	As mentioned earlier, he had always tried to create a more personal connection with
1096140	1100020	his audience, now when combining this with his content, although his personality was
1100020	1104240	definitely contrived, it was passable, it kinda came with the territory.
1104240	1107260	When you're stepping out of your comfort zone and responding to someone in a way where
1107260	1110600	you're not just providing information like your other content, and you're actually
1110600	1114620	trying to express legitimate argumentative points, you can't just do it in a happy,
1114620	1119820	jolly tone, especially when trying to convey other emotions, it sounds unhealthy.
1119820	1121900	So why on earth did he respond like this?
1121900	1125700	It's the classic problem of being a stranger to criticism for so long.
1125700	1129680	When we all receive harsh criticism for the first time round, it feels huge, it takes
1129680	1133580	a massive toll on us, like everything, it just knocks us back, and whenever we face
1133580	1137100	it down, everything in the moment just seems bigger than it actually is.
1137100	1141220	We feel it's coming for our reputation and our standing, and we feel the need to defend
1141220	1142220	ourselves.
1142220	1146140	With that said, responding to a satire is pretty far-fetched, and through this, Carl
1146140	1150700	exhibited extensive insecurity in the content that he was making, possibly validating the
1150700	1153760	criticisms being levelled at him by Fantano.
1153760	1157420	When you watch a serious Matthew Santoro vid, it's not done with the tone,
1157420	1162060	Welcome back guys, Matthew Santoro, and today we have to talk about domestic abuse, which
1162060	1165220	makes me very sad.
1165220	1169300	The videos are a completely different tone, and they allow Santoro to open up a new side
1169300	1174140	to the audience, which more successfully builds a relationship than any transfer of persona.
1174140	1178740	That's what Bryce needed to do, and instead we got this.
1178740	1183340	In all seriousness, this video was all in good fun, I just had to respond to Anthony's
1183340	1187820	video because he randomly decided to attack me and my viewers, and I didn't like that.
1187820	1192600	Jesus Christ, and once M. Lemon and videos that followed from other creators showed up
1192600	1195800	how fragile his persona was, it put him on borrowed time.
1195800	1198800	The problem was, he hit a characteristic contradiction.
1198800	1203100	His tone was too much like a WatchMojo host, as mentioned earlier, and you can't create
1203100	1204800	a deeper persona for that.
1204800	1208220	In fact, watching the videos, although he did attempt to deepen his character in ways
1208220	1213120	we'll address soon, one of the very awkward changes was he progressively upped his persona
1213120	1214120	to 11.
1214120	1215720	If we go from one of his first videos...
1215720	1219760	Hello internet, and welcome to Behind The Meme, where we take a look at the meaning
1219760	1222460	and the origin of your favourite memes.
1222460	1223960	Today we have a look at Dodge.
1223960	1224960	To this...
1224960	1229960	Hello internet, and welcome to Behind The Meme.
1229960	1233140	Today we have a look at Gru's plan.
1233140	1237040	The only change is the increasingly insipid tone.
1237040	1241640	He seems to have wrongly attributed his quirky persona to the success of the channel, and
1241640	1247080	he so continues to up the gears, and it becomes nauseating and so transparently fake.
1247080	1249960	This will become particularly problematic for your viewer base, who are going to be
1249960	1254200	drawn in by your rather juvenile tone, because they'll inevitably grow out of it.
1254200	1257680	In spite of the criticisms, the least you could say is that your Harambe video could
1257680	1260000	be watched by people of all ages.
1260000	1263800	Any of the newer stuff seems specifically aimed at the youngest denomination who will
1263800	1265680	never stick around anyway.
1265680	1269860	What inflames this scenario is the zeitgeist, as said multiple times before, this was the
1269860	1273960	era where happy-go-lucky personas died.
1273960	1278380	We want brooding, deeper characters, and his persona became outdated very quickly.
1278380	1282260	Equally, when trying to develop character, he often turned to a very sensitive topic
1282260	1286700	like Stefan Karl, and once again, I can't look into a person's mind and decipher their
1286700	1290620	motivations for making a video like that, but it seemed more of a way to prove that
1290620	1294700	he was a good guy, and although I don't necessarily think showing that you're a kind person is
1294700	1299660	a bad thing, if you go out of your way to make videos that divert from your normal style,
1299660	1305340	and on top of it, immediately after you receive criticism, as documented by my best mate Pyro,
1305340	1328020	it seems rather insincere.
1328020	1332140	It doesn't seem like character development, it seems like a construction of what he wants
1332140	1337460	people to see, the topics of your videos should not solely be dictating your character, however,
1337460	1340900	none of this mattered as long as he was still pulling views.
1340900	1345780	As noted on my Zoe Burger video, providing you have a positive like to dislike ratio,
1345780	1349860	your video typically tends to maintain rotation with the YouTube algorithms, if it's on
1349860	1352220	a trending meme, we're all quids in.
1352220	1357100	You see, in a way, behind the meme situation, Ag created a very strange dynamic, the criticism
1357100	1361980	from commentators like Emp, Fantano, and Pyro, meant that there was this sway of the
1361980	1367100	people who were completely out for blood whenever he uploaded, he gained a level of infamy,
1367100	1370980	equally though, if he could reach beyond there and hit a demographic of casual viewers, he'd
1370980	1374780	probably be able to alleviate the hatred, as those people aren't really concerned
1374780	1378420	with the culture, and at first, this seemed to be the case, he seemed to be able to scrape
1378420	1383220	the views to keep a positive ratio over those who were vehemently against him.
1383220	1388420	However, barely a year after all this had began, in August, the dislikes began to win
1388420	1391540	out, and it began to kill him.
1391540	1395660	Probably one of the most ironic tales to this is that people who he introduced memes to,
1395660	1400000	who provided him the views and support at the initial stage, then likely were the ones
1400000	1404980	who became more educated, and were then the ones to come back and contribute to his channel's
1404980	1405980	demise.
1405980	1409260	That's the thing, if you're an unassuming citizen discovering memes, then behind the
1409260	1413140	meme is perfect, once you're in the culture, you don't need him, and in fact, you may
1413140	1414700	come to loathe him.
1414700	1419820	Equally, as the popularity of the meme stopped its ascension, he had less people to introduce
1419820	1424660	it to, and increased accessibility online to memes further meant that he had even less
1424660	1426280	utility than before.
1426280	1431060	On top of this, he used his get out of jail free meme cards early on, by covering old
1431060	1435900	popular more timeless memes already, he had nothing left, and he had to rely on the modern
1435900	1437520	memes to be popular.
1437520	1440820	And as Emp rightfully noted, although we've definitely experienced an increase in the
1440820	1445060	number of memes, and some of them do seem popular in the moment, they're not lasting
1445060	1449140	the way that many of the older ones did, and that just doesn't bode well for a channel
1449140	1454240	like behind the meme, the markets had been flooded, his time was up, there was nothing,
1454240	1458900	his personality gave us nothing, his content gave us nothing, and the audience response
1458900	1462320	had soured, and the demand had plateaued.
1462320	1467240	It was a timely death, and eventually after a run with diminishing returns, behind the
1467240	1470740	meme stopped.
1470740	1472840	But it wasn't over.
1477840	1483720	As said, Kyle clearly viewed himself as being able to rebrand, his meme review was dead,
1483720	1488040	but what if he changed his content, did something else he was passionate about, there were so
1488040	1491280	many opportunities out there for him that he could pursue.
1491280	1495560	He made the return video we spoke about, there made a tribute video to Stefan Karl
1495560	1498480	after his passing, and then came his little series.
1498480	1503920	Now, I'm not going to detail every single thing, but I am going to give a quick summary,
1503920	1506940	just so people know what this is about, if you wanna watch the videos, they're still
1506940	1507940	up on his channel.
1507940	1512360	It begins with a trip to the store in which he buys the most familiar brand of vodka,
1512360	1515640	Smirnoff, implying that there will be intoxicated antics occurring.
1515640	1519960	In his second video he has consumed some vodka, shoots the shit, talks vaguely about the future
1519960	1524500	of his channel, showing you around his house and making random comments, and so on.
1524500	1528920	The third episode includes him driving intoxicated, and then talking about some deep stuff while
1528920	1529920	contemplating.
1529920	1533240	So here is the character development, we're getting a bit deeper, a bit darker.
1533240	1536160	Now there are some details that I'm going to leave out, because I think they're important
1536160	1540880	for the judgement, but you can tell that his tone is changing, and becoming more disturbed.
1540880	1545920	The fourth episode is more of this, just him back in an indoor environment, crying, drinking
1545920	1547280	more, and so on.
1547560	1552200	And the final episode is the fateful moment where he takes his own life, truly tragic.
1552200	1557420	Of course, it was a ruse, but why did he do something like this, well to prove a point,
1557420	1561020	he was telling his story of how he felt, and the hate he received.
1561020	1565400	But through my experience, it caused me to take a step back and have a look at our society
1565400	1566620	as a whole.
1566620	1571020	How we treat each other unfairly, how quick we are to turn our backs on another human,
1571020	1575220	how easily it is to forget we're all in the same boat just trying to get by.
1575220	1579500	Sadly, all these negative characteristics seem to be amplified on the internet where
1579500	1581660	people think they are anonymous.
1581660	1585860	It sucks, but that is how our society seems to conduct itself lately.
1585860	1590540	It's clear through this, he felt a lot of it was unwarranted, and yielded unnecessary
1590540	1591780	consequences.
1591780	1592780	So how do I feel?
1592780	1594220	Is he right?
1594220	1596380	Was the hate too much?
1596380	1598380	Well I think it's a double edged sword.
1598380	1602100	The problem is, we as public figures have to be prepared to take criticism.
1602100	1605540	The thing about behind the meme is that he never really dealt criticism.
1605540	1608020	As he said, he was just spreading positivity.
1608020	1610580	How can you hate someone for spreading love?
1610580	1615120	And on one hand, I don't think the hate messages, cruel comments, and so on are justified.
1615120	1619300	If they're directed in a personal fashion, they're very seldom justified, and I'll stand
1619300	1620300	by that.
1620300	1623480	And if you want to challenge them and take them on, then more power to you.
1623480	1628300	Things like doxing also absolutely terrible, and I think calling out people like that is
1628300	1629300	reasonable.
1629500	1634660	And the sort of vague narrative that was constructed through this seems to encompass all the culture
1634660	1638820	as hate, and whether you meant it to come across that way, the sort of very forced comments
1638820	1642860	that were inserted in the build up was the one identifiably fake element, although it
1642860	1645940	was implausible, it was otherwise well done.
1645940	1650980	Here's the point, as a guy, you may be lovely, you may be delightful, and although some of
1650980	1651980	M.P.
1651980	1656680	Lemon's criticism seems slightly doubtful to me, they weren't based in impossible outcomes,
1656680	1661440	and they were delivered in a way that separated the creator from the content, and they weren't
1661440	1665240	particularly harsh, although they did imply some strong consequences.
1665240	1669540	At the end of the video, M.P. even says this himself, that he's not there to hate on behind
1669540	1674060	the meme of the person, not hate on Kyle, so whether it was Kyle's intention to turn
1674060	1680280	criticism onto M.P. or Pyro, or anyone else who kind of led this cultural war, or not,
1680280	1684680	the fans who are interpreting it that way right now really need to think about this.
1684680	1688920	As creators, we can have a responsibility with how we deal our message.
1688920	1693440	If we feel someone is making bad content or can do better, we shouldn't hold our tongues.
1693440	1697280	If we can turn it into a good video, then hell, we should go for it.
1697280	1701280	I don't know why we wouldn't, and equally, there will always be people who take up a
1701280	1703280	cause with the sole purpose of hating.
1703280	1708640	What we need to make sure is that we don't rile people up unnecessarily, I don't think
1708640	1711860	any of the critics that we spoke about today did that.
1711860	1716040	Equally M.P. did actually see behind the memes channel as an actual threat to a culture
1716040	1720460	very intimate to him, of course he was going to make a video on it, he wants to see his
1720460	1725140	community thrive, behind the meme stood against that to him, and so of course it became a
1725140	1729720	discourse of what's best for a community, and that's a complex conversation, and people
1729720	1733740	misinterpret it, but it didn't make his points less valid.
1733740	1738180	Equally I find the notion of why can't we all just be positive, utterly pretentious,
1738180	1742660	and everyone knows I've never liked it, criticism isn't always meant to be positive,
1742660	1747180	imagine that being the case for movies, the transformers films entertained a lot of people,
1747180	1750860	made a lot of people happy, doesn't mean that people can't find reasonable explanations
1750860	1756260	to bash on it and deal out criticism, Ray Sremmurd, I am not a fan, but some people
1756260	1760900	really enjoy it, but it doesn't mean I shouldn't hate it, do I endorse sending hate messages
1760900	1761900	to the lads?
1761900	1766520	No, not at all, they're making music, but you have to separate those two elements, or
1766520	1771520	else it just seems like you're using suicide to get back at your critic, which is never
1771520	1773100	a good look.
1773100	1776800	Positivity can be a dangerous fail for very sketchy behaviour, and if you don't go after
1776800	1780620	someone simply because they seem nice on the surface, you may be looking over some very
1780620	1784640	seedy business, which there have been many examples of.
1784640	1788740	Criticism doesn't always make us feel good, but we're not entitled to a bubble of happiness
1788740	1792760	and smiles, and when I deal criticism, I'll do my best to be honest and fair, but at the
1792760	1798040	same time, I know someone might still be offended by it, it's down to them to harness that criticism,
1798040	1801520	and that's something Behind The Meme never did, he never changed his content for the
1801520	1805120	better, he never listened to what people were saying, and he paid the price for that in
1805120	1806720	the subsequent ratings.
1806720	1811020	I can't really feel bad for him on that behalf, at the end of the day, someone made a better
1811020	1815880	argument for why his content wasn't that good, regardless of who it pleased, or how positive
1815880	1816880	it was.
1816880	1820720	Khan was Behind The Meme mostly in the past, and I think that's sensible, it's had its
1820720	1826120	day, and as concepts, his channel was on its way out regardless, even without the hate.
1826120	1829880	I don't know if he's gonna have trouble restarting, as I feel like a lot of his critics will stick
1829880	1833760	around, but maybe we can become familiarised with a different side of a person who we've
1833760	1836840	really only gone after that one persona in the past.
1836840	1837880	I feel it's time.
1837880	1839520	Is Behind The Meme a victim?
1839520	1843680	It depends how you define victimhood, if being subject to disproportionate hate makes him
1843680	1848500	a victim, then yeah, he might well be, it seemed unnecessary, but at the same time it's
1848500	1852300	a consistent principle applied across all realms of commentary.
1852300	1856180	We've all received death threats, and looking at the actual creators who've criticised
1856180	1859780	them, they haven't been particularly harsh, and attacking them for merely having narratives
1859780	1862060	that contradict your image doesn't wash with me.
1862060	1866580	At the end of the day, they're just creators who wanted you to do your genre more justice,
1866580	1871460	and I hope that you will keep that in mind when taking your content in a future direction.
1871460	1876500	So yeah, those are my fairly extensive thoughts on Behind The Meme, interesting bloke, I would
1876500	1879780	love to hear your thoughts in the comments below, please tell me what you think.
1879780	1883740	Also I wanna give a big shoutout to the editors as always, I'm going to leave their links
1883740	1887620	in the pinned comment, go check them out, have a subscribe, they do a lot of good work
1887620	1888660	for me.
1888660	1893540	These videos would not be as top notch as they are without the help of these editors,
1893540	1894940	so definitely check them out if you can.
1894940	1901180	If you wanna reach me on Twitter, at TheRightOpinion, Facebook, I'll leave my links there, in the
1901180	1905660	pinned comment too, Discord, also in the pinned comment, everything's in the pinned comment.
1905700	1908100	I wanna give everyone some love.
1908100	1911860	Anyhow, I don't think I really have too much else to add, I don't know exactly when this
1911860	1916620	is gonna be out, but I hope it's out in time to at least maintain some of your interest.
1916620	1918620	Anyhow, we'll just have to find that out.
1918620	1921980	Until then, I'm TheRightOpinion, and I'll see you in the next one.
