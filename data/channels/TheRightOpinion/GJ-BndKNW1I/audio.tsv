0	1680	Let's get to the bottom of this.
6680	10580	Hello ladies and gentlemen, welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time.
10580	13780	And in case you haven't noticed, I'm not a very ceremonial person.
13780	17660	While many people were pumping out Christmas-themed contents, the Grinch Opinion over here
17660	21300	hadn't even changed his Twitter AVI or name to something mildly festive.
21300	24300	Nor have I really done videos on any other joyous periods.
24300	28860	However, now and then a period may invoke me to do something that I would not typically do otherwise.
28860	30980	Today's topic is one of those very few.
30980	35860	So on the 1st of February, I was reminded of something that had gathered dust in the back of my brain.
35860	37860	That is LGBT History Month.
37860	41180	Twitter were kind enough to remind me with a cheeky hashtag slapped in the trends for me.
41180	45540	So being the nosy bugger that I am, I decided to click on it and see what mostly people were saying.
45540	50780	Now, it was the usual positivity stuff, and it's vacuous but mostly harmless, so who am I to judge?
50780	54500	No, the spicy stuff that caught my eye was this one very provocative tweet,
54500	57820	nicely tucked in amongst all the self-affirmative content.
57820	59580	What does the tweet say, I hear you ask?
59580	62740	Not that actually anyone's asking that and I'm pre-recording my voice,
62740	66980	and that's a fucking stupid concept and idiotic thing to think at all, but yeah.
66980	71140	Going off on a bit of a tangent, here is the tweet, essentially noting the clear disparity
71140	76100	between the HIV contraction rate between the homosexual male community and the heterosexual community.
76100	78300	Sprinkled at the end is the colloquial phrase,
78300	82580	figures don't lie, folks, giving us a nudge about what he's trying to imply.
82580	85860	He then cites a link, allowing him to back up his factual statement.
85900	90020	This man is good ol' Benjamin Disraeli, and he said there are three types of lies.
90020	92500	Lies, damn lies, and statistics.
92500	93700	What did he mean by that?
93700	96820	Well, he didn't mean that statistics don't reflect legitimate information,
96820	100380	but the way they can be used without proper context can push an agenda
100380	104100	that the statistics, when placed under scrutiny, may not properly represent.
104100	107580	Now, after some searching, I did find the statistics that he was referring to.
107580	111500	What I find curious is how he chose the two most contrasting percentages.
111500	114300	The fruit from the cherry tree was picked very carefully indeed.
114300	117420	Now, of course, 66% of new diagnoses a year is no good,
117420	119700	but the volume of diagnoses is what matters.
119700	123740	For example, if I was to say 100% of people who suffer from the common cold are of Asian descent,
123740	128860	it wouldn't validate my argument if only one person out of the whole Asian peninsula was actually diagnosed.
128860	131460	It's about the proportion of persons within that demographic,
131460	135540	and ignoring that certainly wouldn't be compatible with any argument without further context.
135540	140220	What he has done here has introduced conditional probabilities, but disregarded prior probabilities.
140220	145460	What would be more accurate is to say that just under 5% of homosexual males in the UK are HIV positive,
145460	151300	because if you want to make a general point against homosexuality as a whole, that's the only way to be fully relevant.
151300	154420	With that said, from my perspective, 5% is still far too high,
154420	158260	mainly because it's still being spread unknowingly, and sometimes knowingly.
158260	163540	But once again, you can't make HIV out to be this death machine cutting through the LGBT community when it's not,
163540	167060	and you certainly can't then say, this is why people need to stop being gay.
167060	168140	Whenever challenged, he says,
168140	169900	Oh, I was just stating a fact.
169900	174900	But a fact is not always conducive to the implication, especially when you confuse the demographic with a disease.
174900	178020	I'm more than prepared to admit that there's an issue surrounding unprotected sex,
178020	182540	but unfortunately, it's just a fact that a certain type of intercourse particularly associated with homosexuality
182540	184980	is a lot more likely to spread sexual disease.
184980	191020	However, just because being gay is more likely to lead to HIV or AIDS doesn't mean that homosexuality presupposes it.
191020	195300	As proven, currently approximately half of those diagnosed with AIDS are heterosexual.
195300	199220	A highly disproportionate figure does not give him the right to destroy the exception.
199220	204340	Many walks of life will put us at knowing risk, an occupation, a hobby, it doesn't mean that we shouldn't do them,
204340	208980	and I believe that sexuality is not a choice, so there is even less accountability on that behalf.
208980	211020	Another exemplar for the model would be this,
211020	213900	a majority of people who suffer from Ebola are from Africa.
213900	216620	It does not lead that being African presupposes Ebola,
216620	219820	nor does it mean that we should focus on stopping people from being African.
219820	222540	Now, from a more traditionalist viewpoint, there are two responses.
222540	225580	Some would argue that there is more responsibility bestowed with HIV.
225580	228300	It is a different disease and can be handled better with more control.
228300	231020	Something like Ebola is a lot more random and hard to handle.
231020	233100	I agree, but that's not the point of the analogy.
233100	234980	I am pointing out the issue of the focus.
234980	238860	Telling people to stop being gay would not prevent the spread of an indiscriminate disease,
238860	241500	just because it's more prevalent in one demographic.
241500	245380	Now, the other argument is that race is more biologically decided than sexuality.
245380	249500	This is also true, but once again, it's the inference that follows which is arguably false.
249500	253020	Sexuality definitely has social influence, as proven by twin studies,
253020	255220	but that doesn't mean that it is a choice,
255220	259140	nor does it imply that you can educate people out of it, as this tweeter seems to claim.
259140	263660	It is a very philosophical grey area, because research cannot say too much definitively.
263660	266260	Speaking from experience, so please take this with a pinch of salt,
266260	271020	sexuality was a realization, in spite of the fact that I had never been educated about it at all.
271020	272420	No one taught me to be gay.
272420	276020	I went to a Christian school, I was waiting to be attracted to women, basically,
276020	278420	until I wasn't, in the spirit of Destiny 2.
278420	281620	In modern society, more people have access to that realization.
281620	283500	I don't believe it's something that I could have chosen,
283500	286620	because in spite of my eccentricities, I am a rational being,
286620	290900	and in a rational situation like that, I would have, quote, chosen to be straight.
290900	294700	There needs to be better education for heterosexual and homosexual people.
294700	299740	Many don't know the risk of contracting asexual diseases 18 times higher when done through the rectum.
299740	304860	Many don't understand that not every type of sex is the same, and this, in fact, leads to a higher risk.
304860	307380	Those are the serious solutions that we need to be talking about.
307380	312060	His whole argument comes down to more gay people suffer from HIV-related illnesses, so let's stop them.
312060	316740	If you want to stop it, I don't know why the logical step to preventing an indiscriminate disease
316740	319540	that affects straight people too, is to stop being gay.
319540	323180	The whole AIDS-HIV argument shouldn't be weaponized like it has been.
323180	327780	It should be time to look and say, how can we make it that more people are clued up?
327780	331420	This sort of position is what I call the veil of vested interest.
331420	337220	Don't do this, kids, you might deal with a problem that we so badly care about, but don't care about enough to solve.
337220	342460	Not to mention that you can choose to do all these other things that will entail risk, but just not this thing.
342460	343860	This thing's too bad.
343860	347140	For me, this is the sort of stuff that's masqueraded in the common good,
347140	351020	but really just reflects a very personally idealistic vision of society,
351020	356500	and his comments later, regarding it as perverse, just say to me that it's more of a social order issue to him,
356500	358860	and I always find that rather snowflake-like.
358860	364740	HIV is shit, AIDS is shit, and all that is shit, but I don't understand why it reflects any sort of degeneracy.
364740	370180	Maybe an ignorance, maybe a habitual oversexualization, which is a knowledge, but it's one of those things.
370180	375420	It's just important that with that sexualization doesn't come a carelessness, and that's what we need to work on.
375420	378020	Now that's not to say the gay community shouldn't pay attention to it.
378020	381980	On the contrary, to all you fags out there, I get it, it's easy, spur of the moment,
381980	386060	you don't have to worry about impregnating a dude, but please, either you get some protection,
386060	388780	or you make sure they get some protection, or both preferably.
388780	392100	Although research into HIV and AIDS has come a mighty long way,
392100	397620	it would be much better to spare the hassle, and to make sure that you're not a victim of a horrible, horrible disease.
397620	402780	Do it for me, think of the right opinion when you're having sex, and think about all the things that I've said.
402780	406500	And that advice goes to anyone else out there. Kids, wear protection.
406500	411900	Parents, ask yourself why your kids are watching my videos. Cunts. Oops. Anyway.
411900	416740	What are your thoughts? I'm mixing up a bit this time around, but I have to have some variation from time to time.
416740	419100	I'd love to hear what you think in the comments below.
419100	422140	Until then, I'm The Right Opinion, and I'll see you in the next one.
