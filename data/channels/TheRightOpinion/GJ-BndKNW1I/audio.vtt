00:00.000 --> 00:01.680
Let's get to the bottom of this.

00:06.680 --> 00:10.580
Hello ladies and gentlemen, welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time.

00:10.580 --> 00:13.780
And in case you haven't noticed, I'm not a very ceremonial person.

00:13.780 --> 00:17.660
While many people were pumping out Christmas-themed contents, the Grinch Opinion over here

00:17.660 --> 00:21.300
hadn't even changed his Twitter AVI or name to something mildly festive.

00:21.300 --> 00:24.300
Nor have I really done videos on any other joyous periods.

00:24.300 --> 00:28.860
However, now and then a period may invoke me to do something that I would not typically do otherwise.

00:28.860 --> 00:30.980
Today's topic is one of those very few.

00:30.980 --> 00:35.860
So on the 1st of February, I was reminded of something that had gathered dust in the back of my brain.

00:35.860 --> 00:37.860
That is LGBT History Month.

00:37.860 --> 00:41.180
Twitter were kind enough to remind me with a cheeky hashtag slapped in the trends for me.

00:41.180 --> 00:45.540
So being the nosy bugger that I am, I decided to click on it and see what mostly people were saying.

00:45.540 --> 00:50.780
Now, it was the usual positivity stuff, and it's vacuous but mostly harmless, so who am I to judge?

00:50.780 --> 00:54.500
No, the spicy stuff that caught my eye was this one very provocative tweet,

00:54.500 --> 00:57.820
nicely tucked in amongst all the self-affirmative content.

00:57.820 --> 00:59.580
What does the tweet say, I hear you ask?

00:59.580 --> 01:02.740
Not that actually anyone's asking that and I'm pre-recording my voice,

01:02.740 --> 01:06.980
and that's a fucking stupid concept and idiotic thing to think at all, but yeah.

01:06.980 --> 01:11.140
Going off on a bit of a tangent, here is the tweet, essentially noting the clear disparity

01:11.140 --> 01:16.100
between the HIV contraction rate between the homosexual male community and the heterosexual community.

01:16.100 --> 01:18.300
Sprinkled at the end is the colloquial phrase,

01:18.300 --> 01:22.580
figures don't lie, folks, giving us a nudge about what he's trying to imply.

01:22.580 --> 01:25.860
He then cites a link, allowing him to back up his factual statement.

01:25.900 --> 01:30.020
This man is good ol' Benjamin Disraeli, and he said there are three types of lies.

01:30.020 --> 01:32.500
Lies, damn lies, and statistics.

01:32.500 --> 01:33.700
What did he mean by that?

01:33.700 --> 01:36.820
Well, he didn't mean that statistics don't reflect legitimate information,

01:36.820 --> 01:40.380
but the way they can be used without proper context can push an agenda

01:40.380 --> 01:44.100
that the statistics, when placed under scrutiny, may not properly represent.

01:44.100 --> 01:47.580
Now, after some searching, I did find the statistics that he was referring to.

01:47.580 --> 01:51.500
What I find curious is how he chose the two most contrasting percentages.

01:51.500 --> 01:54.300
The fruit from the cherry tree was picked very carefully indeed.

01:54.300 --> 01:57.420
Now, of course, 66% of new diagnoses a year is no good,

01:57.420 --> 01:59.700
but the volume of diagnoses is what matters.

01:59.700 --> 02:03.740
For example, if I was to say 100% of people who suffer from the common cold are of Asian descent,

02:03.740 --> 02:08.860
it wouldn't validate my argument if only one person out of the whole Asian peninsula was actually diagnosed.

02:08.860 --> 02:11.460
It's about the proportion of persons within that demographic,

02:11.460 --> 02:15.540
and ignoring that certainly wouldn't be compatible with any argument without further context.

02:15.540 --> 02:20.220
What he has done here has introduced conditional probabilities, but disregarded prior probabilities.

02:20.220 --> 02:25.460
What would be more accurate is to say that just under 5% of homosexual males in the UK are HIV positive,

02:25.460 --> 02:31.300
because if you want to make a general point against homosexuality as a whole, that's the only way to be fully relevant.

02:31.300 --> 02:34.420
With that said, from my perspective, 5% is still far too high,

02:34.420 --> 02:38.260
mainly because it's still being spread unknowingly, and sometimes knowingly.

02:38.260 --> 02:43.540
But once again, you can't make HIV out to be this death machine cutting through the LGBT community when it's not,

02:43.540 --> 02:47.060
and you certainly can't then say, this is why people need to stop being gay.

02:47.060 --> 02:48.140
Whenever challenged, he says,

02:48.140 --> 02:49.900
Oh, I was just stating a fact.

02:49.900 --> 02:54.900
But a fact is not always conducive to the implication, especially when you confuse the demographic with a disease.

02:54.900 --> 02:58.020
I'm more than prepared to admit that there's an issue surrounding unprotected sex,

02:58.020 --> 03:02.540
but unfortunately, it's just a fact that a certain type of intercourse particularly associated with homosexuality

03:02.540 --> 03:04.980
is a lot more likely to spread sexual disease.

03:04.980 --> 03:11.020
However, just because being gay is more likely to lead to HIV or AIDS doesn't mean that homosexuality presupposes it.

03:11.020 --> 03:15.300
As proven, currently approximately half of those diagnosed with AIDS are heterosexual.

03:15.300 --> 03:19.220
A highly disproportionate figure does not give him the right to destroy the exception.

03:19.220 --> 03:24.340
Many walks of life will put us at knowing risk, an occupation, a hobby, it doesn't mean that we shouldn't do them,

03:24.340 --> 03:28.980
and I believe that sexuality is not a choice, so there is even less accountability on that behalf.

03:28.980 --> 03:31.020
Another exemplar for the model would be this,

03:31.020 --> 03:33.900
a majority of people who suffer from Ebola are from Africa.

03:33.900 --> 03:36.620
It does not lead that being African presupposes Ebola,

03:36.620 --> 03:39.820
nor does it mean that we should focus on stopping people from being African.

03:39.820 --> 03:42.540
Now, from a more traditionalist viewpoint, there are two responses.

03:42.540 --> 03:45.580
Some would argue that there is more responsibility bestowed with HIV.

03:45.580 --> 03:48.300
It is a different disease and can be handled better with more control.

03:48.300 --> 03:51.020
Something like Ebola is a lot more random and hard to handle.

03:51.020 --> 03:53.100
I agree, but that's not the point of the analogy.

03:53.100 --> 03:54.980
I am pointing out the issue of the focus.

03:54.980 --> 03:58.860
Telling people to stop being gay would not prevent the spread of an indiscriminate disease,

03:58.860 --> 04:01.500
just because it's more prevalent in one demographic.

04:01.500 --> 04:05.380
Now, the other argument is that race is more biologically decided than sexuality.

04:05.380 --> 04:09.500
This is also true, but once again, it's the inference that follows which is arguably false.

04:09.500 --> 04:13.020
Sexuality definitely has social influence, as proven by twin studies,

04:13.020 --> 04:15.220
but that doesn't mean that it is a choice,

04:15.220 --> 04:19.140
nor does it imply that you can educate people out of it, as this tweeter seems to claim.

04:19.140 --> 04:23.660
It is a very philosophical grey area, because research cannot say too much definitively.

04:23.660 --> 04:26.260
Speaking from experience, so please take this with a pinch of salt,

04:26.260 --> 04:31.020
sexuality was a realization, in spite of the fact that I had never been educated about it at all.

04:31.020 --> 04:32.420
No one taught me to be gay.

04:32.420 --> 04:36.020
I went to a Christian school, I was waiting to be attracted to women, basically,

04:36.020 --> 04:38.420
until I wasn't, in the spirit of Destiny 2.

04:38.420 --> 04:41.620
In modern society, more people have access to that realization.

04:41.620 --> 04:43.500
I don't believe it's something that I could have chosen,

04:43.500 --> 04:46.620
because in spite of my eccentricities, I am a rational being,

04:46.620 --> 04:50.900
and in a rational situation like that, I would have, quote, chosen to be straight.

04:50.900 --> 04:54.700
There needs to be better education for heterosexual and homosexual people.

04:54.700 --> 04:59.740
Many don't know the risk of contracting asexual diseases 18 times higher when done through the rectum.

04:59.740 --> 05:04.860
Many don't understand that not every type of sex is the same, and this, in fact, leads to a higher risk.

05:04.860 --> 05:07.380
Those are the serious solutions that we need to be talking about.

05:07.380 --> 05:12.060
His whole argument comes down to more gay people suffer from HIV-related illnesses, so let's stop them.

05:12.060 --> 05:16.740
If you want to stop it, I don't know why the logical step to preventing an indiscriminate disease

05:16.740 --> 05:19.540
that affects straight people too, is to stop being gay.

05:19.540 --> 05:23.180
The whole AIDS-HIV argument shouldn't be weaponized like it has been.

05:23.180 --> 05:27.780
It should be time to look and say, how can we make it that more people are clued up?

05:27.780 --> 05:31.420
This sort of position is what I call the veil of vested interest.

05:31.420 --> 05:37.220
Don't do this, kids, you might deal with a problem that we so badly care about, but don't care about enough to solve.

05:37.220 --> 05:42.460
Not to mention that you can choose to do all these other things that will entail risk, but just not this thing.

05:42.460 --> 05:43.860
This thing's too bad.

05:43.860 --> 05:47.140
For me, this is the sort of stuff that's masqueraded in the common good,

05:47.140 --> 05:51.020
but really just reflects a very personally idealistic vision of society,

05:51.020 --> 05:56.500
and his comments later, regarding it as perverse, just say to me that it's more of a social order issue to him,

05:56.500 --> 05:58.860
and I always find that rather snowflake-like.

05:58.860 --> 06:04.740
HIV is shit, AIDS is shit, and all that is shit, but I don't understand why it reflects any sort of degeneracy.

06:04.740 --> 06:10.180
Maybe an ignorance, maybe a habitual oversexualization, which is a knowledge, but it's one of those things.

06:10.180 --> 06:15.420
It's just important that with that sexualization doesn't come a carelessness, and that's what we need to work on.

06:15.420 --> 06:18.020
Now that's not to say the gay community shouldn't pay attention to it.

06:18.020 --> 06:21.980
On the contrary, to all you fags out there, I get it, it's easy, spur of the moment,

06:21.980 --> 06:26.060
you don't have to worry about impregnating a dude, but please, either you get some protection,

06:26.060 --> 06:28.780
or you make sure they get some protection, or both preferably.

06:28.780 --> 06:32.100
Although research into HIV and AIDS has come a mighty long way,

06:32.100 --> 06:37.620
it would be much better to spare the hassle, and to make sure that you're not a victim of a horrible, horrible disease.

06:37.620 --> 06:42.780
Do it for me, think of the right opinion when you're having sex, and think about all the things that I've said.

06:42.780 --> 06:46.500
And that advice goes to anyone else out there. Kids, wear protection.

06:46.500 --> 06:51.900
Parents, ask yourself why your kids are watching my videos. Cunts. Oops. Anyway.

06:51.900 --> 06:56.740
What are your thoughts? I'm mixing up a bit this time around, but I have to have some variation from time to time.

06:56.740 --> 06:59.100
I'd love to hear what you think in the comments below.

06:59.100 --> 07:02.140
Until then, I'm The Right Opinion, and I'll see you in the next one.
