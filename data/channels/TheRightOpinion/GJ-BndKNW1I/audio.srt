1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,680
Let's get to the bottom of this.

2
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:10,580
Hello ladies and gentlemen, welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time.

3
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:13,780
And in case you haven't noticed, I'm not a very ceremonial person.

4
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:17,660
While many people were pumping out Christmas-themed contents, the Grinch Opinion over here

5
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:21,300
hadn't even changed his Twitter AVI or name to something mildly festive.

6
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,300
Nor have I really done videos on any other joyous periods.

7
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,860
However, now and then a period may invoke me to do something that I would not typically do otherwise.

8
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:30,980
Today's topic is one of those very few.

9
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:35,860
So on the 1st of February, I was reminded of something that had gathered dust in the back of my brain.

10
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:37,860
That is LGBT History Month.

11
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:41,180
Twitter were kind enough to remind me with a cheeky hashtag slapped in the trends for me.

12
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:45,540
So being the nosy bugger that I am, I decided to click on it and see what mostly people were saying.

13
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:50,780
Now, it was the usual positivity stuff, and it's vacuous but mostly harmless, so who am I to judge?

14
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:54,500
No, the spicy stuff that caught my eye was this one very provocative tweet,

15
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,820
nicely tucked in amongst all the self-affirmative content.

16
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:59,580
What does the tweet say, I hear you ask?

17
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:02,740
Not that actually anyone's asking that and I'm pre-recording my voice,

18
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:06,980
and that's a fucking stupid concept and idiotic thing to think at all, but yeah.

19
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:11,140
Going off on a bit of a tangent, here is the tweet, essentially noting the clear disparity

20
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:16,100
between the HIV contraction rate between the homosexual male community and the heterosexual community.

21
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:18,300
Sprinkled at the end is the colloquial phrase,

22
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:22,580
figures don't lie, folks, giving us a nudge about what he's trying to imply.

23
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:25,860
He then cites a link, allowing him to back up his factual statement.

24
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:30,020
This man is good ol' Benjamin Disraeli, and he said there are three types of lies.

25
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:32,500
Lies, damn lies, and statistics.

26
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:33,700
What did he mean by that?

27
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:36,820
Well, he didn't mean that statistics don't reflect legitimate information,

28
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:40,380
but the way they can be used without proper context can push an agenda

29
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:44,100
that the statistics, when placed under scrutiny, may not properly represent.

30
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:47,580
Now, after some searching, I did find the statistics that he was referring to.

31
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:51,500
What I find curious is how he chose the two most contrasting percentages.

32
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,300
The fruit from the cherry tree was picked very carefully indeed.

33
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:57,420
Now, of course, 66% of new diagnoses a year is no good,

34
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,700
but the volume of diagnoses is what matters.

35
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:03,740
For example, if I was to say 100% of people who suffer from the common cold are of Asian descent,

36
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:08,860
it wouldn't validate my argument if only one person out of the whole Asian peninsula was actually diagnosed.

37
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:11,460
It's about the proportion of persons within that demographic,

38
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:15,540
and ignoring that certainly wouldn't be compatible with any argument without further context.

39
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:20,220
What he has done here has introduced conditional probabilities, but disregarded prior probabilities.

40
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:25,460
What would be more accurate is to say that just under 5% of homosexual males in the UK are HIV positive,

41
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:31,300
because if you want to make a general point against homosexuality as a whole, that's the only way to be fully relevant.

42
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:34,420
With that said, from my perspective, 5% is still far too high,

43
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:38,260
mainly because it's still being spread unknowingly, and sometimes knowingly.

44
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:43,540
But once again, you can't make HIV out to be this death machine cutting through the LGBT community when it's not,

45
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:47,060
and you certainly can't then say, this is why people need to stop being gay.

46
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:48,140
Whenever challenged, he says,

47
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:49,900
Oh, I was just stating a fact.

48
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:54,900
But a fact is not always conducive to the implication, especially when you confuse the demographic with a disease.

49
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:58,020
I'm more than prepared to admit that there's an issue surrounding unprotected sex,

50
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:02,540
but unfortunately, it's just a fact that a certain type of intercourse particularly associated with homosexuality

51
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:04,980
is a lot more likely to spread sexual disease.

52
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:11,020
However, just because being gay is more likely to lead to HIV or AIDS doesn't mean that homosexuality presupposes it.

53
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:15,300
As proven, currently approximately half of those diagnosed with AIDS are heterosexual.

54
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:19,220
A highly disproportionate figure does not give him the right to destroy the exception.

55
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:24,340
Many walks of life will put us at knowing risk, an occupation, a hobby, it doesn't mean that we shouldn't do them,

56
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:28,980
and I believe that sexuality is not a choice, so there is even less accountability on that behalf.

57
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:31,020
Another exemplar for the model would be this,

58
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:33,900
a majority of people who suffer from Ebola are from Africa.

59
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,620
It does not lead that being African presupposes Ebola,

60
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:39,820
nor does it mean that we should focus on stopping people from being African.

61
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:42,540
Now, from a more traditionalist viewpoint, there are two responses.

62
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:45,580
Some would argue that there is more responsibility bestowed with HIV.

63
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:48,300
It is a different disease and can be handled better with more control.

64
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:51,020
Something like Ebola is a lot more random and hard to handle.

65
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:53,100
I agree, but that's not the point of the analogy.

66
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,980
I am pointing out the issue of the focus.

67
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:58,860
Telling people to stop being gay would not prevent the spread of an indiscriminate disease,

68
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:01,500
just because it's more prevalent in one demographic.

69
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:05,380
Now, the other argument is that race is more biologically decided than sexuality.

70
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:09,500
This is also true, but once again, it's the inference that follows which is arguably false.

71
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:13,020
Sexuality definitely has social influence, as proven by twin studies,

72
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:15,220
but that doesn't mean that it is a choice,

73
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:19,140
nor does it imply that you can educate people out of it, as this tweeter seems to claim.

74
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:23,660
It is a very philosophical grey area, because research cannot say too much definitively.

75
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:26,260
Speaking from experience, so please take this with a pinch of salt,

76
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:31,020
sexuality was a realization, in spite of the fact that I had never been educated about it at all.

77
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,420
No one taught me to be gay.

78
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:36,020
I went to a Christian school, I was waiting to be attracted to women, basically,

79
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:38,420
until I wasn't, in the spirit of Destiny 2.

80
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:41,620
In modern society, more people have access to that realization.

81
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,500
I don't believe it's something that I could have chosen,

82
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,620
because in spite of my eccentricities, I am a rational being,

83
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:50,900
and in a rational situation like that, I would have, quote, chosen to be straight.

84
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:54,700
There needs to be better education for heterosexual and homosexual people.

85
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:59,740
Many don't know the risk of contracting asexual diseases 18 times higher when done through the rectum.

86
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:04,860
Many don't understand that not every type of sex is the same, and this, in fact, leads to a higher risk.

87
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:07,380
Those are the serious solutions that we need to be talking about.

88
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:12,060
His whole argument comes down to more gay people suffer from HIV-related illnesses, so let's stop them.

89
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:16,740
If you want to stop it, I don't know why the logical step to preventing an indiscriminate disease

90
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:19,540
that affects straight people too, is to stop being gay.

91
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:23,180
The whole AIDS-HIV argument shouldn't be weaponized like it has been.

92
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:27,780
It should be time to look and say, how can we make it that more people are clued up?

93
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:31,420
This sort of position is what I call the veil of vested interest.

94
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:37,220
Don't do this, kids, you might deal with a problem that we so badly care about, but don't care about enough to solve.

95
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:42,460
Not to mention that you can choose to do all these other things that will entail risk, but just not this thing.

96
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,860
This thing's too bad.

97
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:47,140
For me, this is the sort of stuff that's masqueraded in the common good,

98
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:51,020
but really just reflects a very personally idealistic vision of society,

99
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:56,500
and his comments later, regarding it as perverse, just say to me that it's more of a social order issue to him,

100
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,860
and I always find that rather snowflake-like.

101
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:04,740
HIV is shit, AIDS is shit, and all that is shit, but I don't understand why it reflects any sort of degeneracy.

102
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:10,180
Maybe an ignorance, maybe a habitual oversexualization, which is a knowledge, but it's one of those things.

103
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:15,420
It's just important that with that sexualization doesn't come a carelessness, and that's what we need to work on.

104
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:18,020
Now that's not to say the gay community shouldn't pay attention to it.

105
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:21,980
On the contrary, to all you fags out there, I get it, it's easy, spur of the moment,

106
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:26,060
you don't have to worry about impregnating a dude, but please, either you get some protection,

107
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:28,780
or you make sure they get some protection, or both preferably.

108
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:32,100
Although research into HIV and AIDS has come a mighty long way,

109
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:37,620
it would be much better to spare the hassle, and to make sure that you're not a victim of a horrible, horrible disease.

110
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:42,780
Do it for me, think of the right opinion when you're having sex, and think about all the things that I've said.

111
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:46,500
And that advice goes to anyone else out there. Kids, wear protection.

112
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:51,900
Parents, ask yourself why your kids are watching my videos. Cunts. Oops. Anyway.

113
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:56,740
What are your thoughts? I'm mixing up a bit this time around, but I have to have some variation from time to time.

114
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:59,100
I'd love to hear what you think in the comments below.

115
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:02,140
Until then, I'm The Right Opinion, and I'll see you in the next one.
