WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:26.160
If we don't do this, we're done for.

00:26.160 --> 00:27.160
I can't get in.

00:27.160 --> 00:28.760
Okay, we have to try something different.

00:28.760 --> 00:29.760
I just sent you a link.

00:29.760 --> 00:30.760
Have you got it?

00:30.760 --> 00:31.760
I got it.

00:31.760 --> 00:32.760
There's only 90 seconds left.

00:32.760 --> 00:33.760
We are running out of time.

00:33.760 --> 00:34.760
Okay, open it.

00:34.760 --> 00:39.760
Set location to Ashburn and click continue.

00:39.760 --> 00:40.760
Done.

00:40.760 --> 00:44.080
Quickly reload the page and we should be in.

00:44.080 --> 00:45.080
They know.

00:45.080 --> 00:46.080
What?

00:46.080 --> 00:47.080
They know we're on a proxy.

00:47.080 --> 00:48.080
Try another server.

00:48.080 --> 00:49.080
There isn't one.

00:49.080 --> 00:50.080
Are you sure?

00:50.080 --> 00:51.080
There's nothing.

00:51.080 --> 00:52.080
60 seconds left.

00:52.080 --> 00:53.080
60 seconds, Gabe.

00:53.080 --> 00:57.080
All right, we're going to need to try something else here.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
Have you tried Surfshark?

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
Surfshark?

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
Surfshark?

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
Yes.

01:02.000 --> 01:05.120
You've got the link now.

01:05.120 --> 01:06.120
It's downloading.

01:06.120 --> 01:07.120
What is it?

01:07.120 --> 01:08.120
It's a VPN service.

01:08.120 --> 01:11.080
When things are geo-blocked right now, we can circumvent it.

01:11.080 --> 01:14.160
We can virtually appear like we are in any one of a hundred countries.

01:14.160 --> 01:17.640
If a Netflix show isn't available in your region, just change your location.

01:17.640 --> 01:19.100
And it encrypts your traffic.

01:19.100 --> 01:22.360
Your internet service provider can't see what you've been up to online.

01:22.360 --> 01:24.960
And Surfshark doesn't keep logs of what you're doing either.

01:24.960 --> 01:26.960
I've got it.

01:27.840 --> 01:28.840
Open it.

01:28.840 --> 01:29.840
Type Boston.

01:29.840 --> 01:30.840
Hit connect.

01:30.840 --> 01:31.840
That's all I have to do?

01:31.840 --> 01:32.840
Just hit connect?

01:32.840 --> 01:33.840
It's that simple?

01:33.840 --> 01:35.480
It really is that simple.

01:35.480 --> 01:36.480
This doesn't work.

01:36.480 --> 01:42.800
We are out of time.

01:42.800 --> 01:45.440
It's still blocked.

01:45.440 --> 01:47.760
They have over 3200 different servers.

01:47.760 --> 01:49.760
Connect to a different one.

01:57.760 --> 02:01.760
Did we get it?

02:05.760 --> 02:07.760
We got it.

02:07.760 --> 02:13.440
If you use Code Opinion or click the link in the description box, you can get an extra

02:13.440 --> 02:15.760
three months of Surfshark for free.

02:26.960 --> 02:37.760
2017.

02:37.760 --> 02:41.760
So that first story we're going to talk about today is about a family that has garnered

02:41.760 --> 02:43.760
a lot of negative attention in the past week.

02:43.760 --> 02:45.760
2017 was an interesting year on YouTube.

02:45.760 --> 02:51.760
You poured molten lava on a phone and a cockroach.

02:51.760 --> 02:55.760
A year of evolution, restlessness, and scandal.

02:56.560 --> 03:03.760
Hello, I wanted to make a statement on what I said in my previous livestream.

03:03.760 --> 03:07.360
The platform reached new heights, but there were many lows.

03:07.360 --> 03:11.760
The website's ecosystem was irreparably changed, and creators were forced to adapt to it.

03:11.760 --> 03:16.560
A bunch of advertisers, fearing backlash, removed their ads entirely from YouTube, and

03:16.560 --> 03:19.760
during this period, every YouTuber saw a decrease in revenue.

03:19.760 --> 03:23.760
Yet, amongst this all, the year mostly belonged to a creator by the name of Jake Paul, and

03:23.760 --> 03:27.760
his motley crew of vagabonds known as Team 10, who had burst onto the scene with all

03:27.760 --> 03:31.760
the bombast of the showbiz world's most notorious figures.

03:35.760 --> 03:39.760
The colossal rise of Team 10 was attributed to a combination of pranks, music videos,

03:39.760 --> 03:43.760
and controversies that all drew attention, criticism, and even anger from fellow content

03:43.760 --> 03:47.760
creators and the general public alike, barely taking them a month to go from just another

03:47.760 --> 03:51.760
YouTube ensemble to public enemy number one.

03:51.760 --> 03:55.760
They continued to participate in escalating antics that would redefine content on YouTube

03:55.760 --> 03:59.760
as many perceived at the time, cementing their status as YouTube royalty, for better and

03:59.760 --> 04:01.760
for worse.

04:05.760 --> 04:09.760
Fast forward a few years, and their YouTube channel is gone, many of their videos are

04:09.760 --> 04:13.760
gone, and their presence online is left behind little more than a brief summary on their

04:13.760 --> 04:17.760
website, and the commitment that a new era is coming soon.

04:17.760 --> 04:21.760
They're carved out on the platform, lost.

04:21.760 --> 04:25.760
Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of

04:25.760 --> 04:29.760
a twat with too much free time, and Team 10, what happened

04:29.760 --> 04:33.760
to them? Let's find out.

04:47.760 --> 04:51.760
As I'm sure you're aware, we all know who Team 10

04:51.760 --> 04:55.760
started with. However,

04:55.760 --> 04:59.760
the origin story is somewhat more intriguing than one might assume it was, because before

04:59.760 --> 05:03.760
Team 10 burst onto the scene, Jake Paul was a relatively popular teen actor and influencer,

05:03.760 --> 05:07.760
posting with his brother Logan, don't know if you've heard of him, on Vine. They garnered

05:07.760 --> 05:11.760
a multi-million following from posting short clips that capitalised on pantomime humour

05:11.760 --> 05:15.760
in the mid-2010s. The content obviously hasn't dated particularly well,

05:18.760 --> 05:22.760
but for what it's worth,

05:22.760 --> 05:26.760
Logan and Jake were strong physical actors who could manipulate their bodies pretty successfully

05:26.760 --> 05:30.760
to enable effective slapstick comedy. Now, Vine didn't last too long,

05:30.760 --> 05:34.760
but the dreams that Jake Paul possessed persisted, and not too long after, he moved to LA

05:34.760 --> 05:38.760
in pursuit of a greater goal, celebrity stardom. This appeared to be materialising

05:38.760 --> 05:42.760
as soon as he acquired a role on the Disney Channel show Bizaardvark, alongside

05:42.760 --> 05:46.760
Madison Hu and Olivia Rodrigo. Jake Paul played the role of a character who would partake

05:46.760 --> 05:50.760
in a variety of days for social media clout, which was touted by Disney as an appropriate role

05:50.760 --> 05:54.760
for such a creator. The show revolved around the concept of reality online, which was fitting

05:54.760 --> 05:58.760
given that at the time Jake Paul was working on his own YouTube projects.

05:58.760 --> 06:02.760
This included a channel called Jake Paul Productions, which appeared to alternate between

06:02.760 --> 06:06.760
the genres of vlogging, comedy, and music. It had been running since May 2014,

06:06.760 --> 06:11.760
and it accumulated a few hundred thousand subscribers by the time Jake's big Disney break came around.

06:11.760 --> 06:15.760
However, not satisfied with a career in acting and a relatively fruitful YouTube channel,

06:15.760 --> 06:19.760
something was brewing behind the scenes, a little project that Jake had been working on

06:19.760 --> 06:24.760
with a few of his buddies, a syndicate known as Team 10. Team 10 had clearly been an idea

06:24.760 --> 06:28.760
conceived by Paul as he was moving to Los Angeles. The Twitter appeared in September 2015

06:28.760 --> 06:32.760
and the official website not too long after. In its formative era, there wasn't too much known

06:32.760 --> 06:36.760
about its ethos or its aims, as its members were still not a major presence online.

06:36.760 --> 06:40.760
However, this would gradually change over the following year as they worked to expand their influence.

06:40.760 --> 06:45.760
Team 10's YouTube channel was launched around May 2016, a couple days before his two-year

06:45.760 --> 06:49.760
upload anniversary on the video sharing platform. Although they were establishing a YouTube

06:49.760 --> 06:53.760
presence, their marketing clearly presented something else, that this was an agency looking to

06:53.760 --> 06:57.760
maximise the potential of future influencers. The advertising heralded it as the first ever

06:57.760 --> 07:02.760
social media for the talent, by the talent. And although channel syndicates and collaborative

07:02.760 --> 07:06.760
groups had existed long before Team 10, there was an air of formality about this arrangement

07:06.760 --> 07:10.760
that appeared to set these creators apart. Being part of Team 10 granted you immediate benefits.

07:10.760 --> 07:14.760
First of all, you'd have a slot on the Team 10 social medias, you'd be listed on their running

07:14.760 --> 07:18.760
Twitter feed, you'd have access to uploading on their YouTube channel, and you'd likely be in the

07:18.760 --> 07:22.760
proximity of the then up-and-coming Jake Paul, who was quickly becoming an overnight sensation,

07:22.760 --> 07:26.760
and would regularly invite other members of the team onto his main channel. Most impressively

07:26.760 --> 07:31.760
though, you'd have a spot in the Team 10 house, a sizable mansion which boasted a basketball hoop

07:31.760 --> 07:35.760
in the kitchen and its own DJ booth. It seems that at its inception, Team 10 was going for a slightly

07:35.760 --> 07:40.760
more diverse assemblage of talent. The early roster featured a young AJ Mitchell who would go on

07:40.760 --> 07:44.760
to find considerable success as a solo musician, Alex Lang who would go on to find work as an actor,

07:44.760 --> 07:49.760
and Nils Visser who was an aspiring DJ at the time. However, in spite of the marketing of Team 10

07:49.760 --> 07:53.760
as a network to bolster individual success, there was a much greater motive that would become very

07:53.760 --> 07:57.760
apparent if you read any of their blog posts from this time. We'll focus on this little excerpt,

07:57.760 --> 08:02.760
that describes their new crib. After listing out all the cool aspects of the Team 10 house,

08:02.760 --> 08:05.760
they share one additional detail, that quote,

08:24.760 --> 08:28.760
Of course, this isn't a great revelation, nor is it some grand deception, but it is a tactic that reveals

08:28.760 --> 08:33.760
what Jake's true intent with Team 10 was, and how it was capable of doing something that he alone

08:33.760 --> 08:38.760
could not, and that was to capitalise on the fandom. You can have a teen idol who will be loved by

08:38.760 --> 08:42.760
swathes of adoring fans, but put them in a group, and you have a dynamic that allows audiences to pick

08:42.760 --> 08:46.760
favourites, play characters off each other, and be invested in the interweaving storylines that existed

08:46.760 --> 08:51.760
in their lives. By then it was pretty clear that Jake Paul knew his appeal to younger teen audiences,

08:51.760 --> 08:55.760
and if you didn't think he was explicit enough with his intentions, then you didn't have to look beyond

08:55.760 --> 09:00.760
the interviews he gave for a more direct explanation of where his goals lay. As you get more and more popular

09:00.760 --> 09:05.760
and start to build a brand name for yourself in the space, you start working with big Fortune 500 companies,

09:05.760 --> 09:09.760
merchandising deals, you can tour, there are lots of ways to monetise, but if you have millions of fans,

09:09.760 --> 09:14.760
and you can convert even 5% of them to pay for something of yours, you are in the 7 figure range.

09:14.760 --> 09:19.760
Jake Paul was doing what a lot of corporate and record label executives had done before, he was manufacturing

09:19.760 --> 09:23.760
Teen Appeal, but whereas many of those who had come before worked within the bounds that corporations

09:23.760 --> 09:28.760
granted them, Jake seemed much more involved in the brand image than the teen idols who had come before him,

09:28.760 --> 09:33.760
and possessed no shame in doing so. Jake Paul crafted a very polarised marketing strategy, on one hand

09:33.760 --> 09:38.760
he placed himself as the nexus of youth stardom, priming a parasocial relationship with audiences who

09:38.760 --> 09:43.760
wanted to feel like they were a part of his life, but conversely also playing to the crowd of entrepreneurs

09:43.760 --> 09:48.760
who wanted a taste of that lifestyle. In another interview with Entertainment Tonight, Paul branded himself

09:49.760 --> 09:54.760
in that he wanted to not just be a creator himself, but he wanted to raise the next generation of influencers,

09:54.760 --> 10:00.760
and that's what Team 10 represented to him, sowing the seeds of talent and reaping the rewards when they came to fruition.

10:00.760 --> 10:04.760
However, although he had amassed a decent number of subscribers on their YouTube channels, and was building

10:04.760 --> 10:10.760
a substantial relationship with audiences, it was hard to say that Jake Paul or Team 10 had quite made the big leagues yet,

10:10.760 --> 10:14.760
there was still a formula waiting to be perfected, but if they wanted to do that, they would have to continue

10:14.760 --> 10:19.760
pushing the boundaries of their content into new realms. How would they manage?

10:24.760 --> 10:25.760
Well.

10:29.760 --> 10:35.760
Although 2016 marked the online establishment of Team 10, 2017 was definitely the year it began to take off,

10:35.760 --> 10:39.760
particularly on Jake Paul's main channel which featured many of the members and the shenanigans that occurred

10:39.760 --> 10:41.760
in the four walls of the Squads Humbler boat.

10:47.760 --> 10:52.760
Paul obviously had a penchant for doing it large, the sort of formula that Mr Beast refined in recent years,

10:52.760 --> 10:57.760
of investing a lot to make a lot. This often led to rather high-budget stunts, pranks, and trips that would regularly

10:57.760 --> 11:02.760
capture the imagination of prospective audiences. His actions were presented in the light of a brash frat boy

11:02.760 --> 11:07.760
who was living it up, pushing the envelope to the extreme. However, unlike the platform's now largest individual creator,

11:07.760 --> 11:12.760
the younger Paul brother also integrated elements of Team 10's personal lives into the content, and this formed

11:12.760 --> 11:17.760
a more sequential narrative within the uploads. Even though these videos would work as standalone clip baiting content,

11:17.760 --> 11:22.760
you could easily be drawn into the interpersonal relationships that these creators would have between each other,

11:22.760 --> 11:27.760
and Jake would regularly alternate between silly and serious, even if it was just through whether he used up or lower case

11:27.760 --> 11:32.760
in the titles, or punctuation marks like ellipses. There was an emotion that would be elicited from a user,

11:32.760 --> 11:37.760
like excitement or fear. There was drama, drama that we'll talk about in a bit, but even when it seemed negative,

11:37.760 --> 11:42.760
it served some sort of purpose in appearing real to those who watched it. Jake Paul knew exactly how he wanted

11:42.760 --> 11:47.760
a video to be marketed, and the daily vlogging style allowed for a constant schedule that made the most of an algorithm

11:47.760 --> 11:52.760
that often rewarded a strong upload schedule. This position Jake Paul's channel in particular is one of the fastest growing channels

11:52.760 --> 11:57.760
on the platform, however many of his Team 10 colleagues also experienced unprecedented prosperity, especially Erica

11:57.760 --> 12:02.760
Costell, the then girlfriend of Paul, whose romantic involvement with Jake was one of the centrepieces of the channel,

12:02.760 --> 12:07.760
and would regularly be used as a selling point for a variety of commodities. All of these demonstrated the components

12:07.760 --> 12:12.760
of the very successful channel that Jake had spoken about in interviews, one that progressed with its viewership's investment

12:12.760 --> 12:17.760
in it. They had a loyal following from their fandom, but it also felt they had yet to become the colossus that Jake likely

12:17.760 --> 12:22.760
envisioned during the conception of the channel. Not that many people were speaking about their content outside their audience,

12:22.760 --> 12:27.760
and there was probably a question about where they would hit that ceiling, but that was about to change.

12:27.760 --> 12:33.760
2017 was not just an interesting year in general, but an interesting year for music.

12:39.760 --> 12:44.760
Particularly on YouTube, we're just seeing a rise in popularity for creator-performed diss tracks, most famously

12:44.760 --> 12:49.760
by the likes of creators like RiceGum. The popularity of general rap music on YouTube had been bolstered by the fact

12:49.760 --> 12:54.760
that reaction content in the musical domain was often oriented towards hip-hop, which seemed to inspire creators

12:54.760 --> 12:59.760
to chance their own arm. These diss tracks were not particularly exceptional, but they were a goofy source of entertainment,

12:59.760 --> 13:05.760
and a new spin on the then pretty exhaustive reaction commentary genre as a whole. However, no creator had properly made

13:05.760 --> 13:10.760
an actual diss track to the rest of YouTube, and why would they? It would be an incredibly braggadocious thing for any creator

13:10.760 --> 13:16.760
to do, and you could easily end up alienating your audience by insulting them. After all, they are part of the YouTube

13:16.760 --> 13:24.760
network as much as anyone. You'd have to have confidence-bordering arrogance to do it, and well, one man, or one team, did.

13:27.760 --> 13:32.760
Now, brag rappers long existed in the music industry, as a matter of fact, its existence underpins many modern

13:32.760 --> 13:38.760
cornerstones of hip-hop music. However, brag rap worked because the brags were either impressive, challenging, or amusing,

13:38.760 --> 13:43.760
and the artists actually had the charisma to back up what they were saying. Jake Paul, on the other hand, does not.

13:43.760 --> 13:48.760
He had attempted a diss track against Ricegum in 2016, which was no better, but you'd think he would have learned something

13:48.760 --> 13:51.760
in the year since, but alas.

13:55.760 --> 14:00.760
There is this degree of ineptitude that is almost fascinating when watching the music video. It exhibits a near elementary

14:00.760 --> 14:05.760
understanding of how rhyming and wordplay operates within music, the number of couplets that just fall flat on their face,

14:05.760 --> 14:11.760
the similes that are so basic they feel like they were written by someone with the talent of a grapefruit. They have a team of people,

14:11.760 --> 14:18.760
this is the best they could come up with. There were so many inconceivable moments, Jake Paul's merch selling like a God Church,

14:18.760 --> 14:24.760
Nick Crompton hailing from the city of England, and using the word litting, unironically. It was pure, unadulterated trash,

14:24.760 --> 14:26.760
and everyone knew.

14:31.760 --> 14:36.760
The thing about virally bad music is that it often has the potential to be more successful than virally good music.

14:36.760 --> 14:42.760
This started all the way back in 2010 with Justin Bieber's Baby, which for a long time was the most disliked video on YouTube,

14:42.760 --> 14:47.760
and persisted over the years with songs like Friday. Whereas in the case of Rebecca Black and Justin Bieber, there was a sense

14:47.760 --> 14:52.760
that they were trying to perform a musical number, Jake Paul and his colleagues possessed none of that, especially given the subject

14:52.760 --> 14:58.760
of their rap song was how much better they were than all of you. Accordingly, they were afforded even less charity by the

14:58.760 --> 15:04.760
already savage internet dwellers who wasted no time in going at Team 10's attempts to establish themselves online.

15:04.760 --> 15:10.760
I heard it in one day, they came out with that. I'm not saying it's easy to write music at all, I know it's tough,

15:10.760 --> 15:13.760
but I think I could come up with a better song in one day.

15:13.760 --> 15:18.760
The criticism came thick and fast, with many people pointing out the obvious, that Jake Paul was a subpar rapper,

15:18.760 --> 15:24.760
and with such a popular and easy target, it wasn't long before even the platform's largest creators were chiming in on the platform's

15:24.760 --> 15:25.760
personality.

15:25.760 --> 15:30.760
I think this song has killed me. I wanna die more than I've ever died before.

15:30.760 --> 15:37.760
Jake Paul was right in one sense, the PewDiePie was indeed next, and in doing that, Team 10 did what they were probably

15:37.760 --> 15:40.760
setting out to do, establishing themselves.

15:53.760 --> 15:58.760
Now, why did I include this part when I'm talking about the demise? Well, I think it very aptly describes Jake Paul's

15:58.760 --> 16:03.760
relationship with Team 10. Jake Paul, on one hand, seemed like a very financially astute individual.

16:03.760 --> 16:10.760
Um, yeah, so we're in a company called Teamdom, you can think of it as a modern day media conglomerate,

16:10.760 --> 16:20.760
where we use social media and content marketing to drive products, talent, make viral videos, and we work with brands,

16:20.760 --> 16:23.760
and develop products, and that sort of stuff, yeah.

16:23.760 --> 16:25.760
On the other hand, he wrote this.

16:26.760 --> 16:31.760
Now, there isn't a direct overlap between business acumen and songwriting capability, but it wouldn't have been

16:31.760 --> 16:35.760
hard for him to hire a ghostwriter who probably would have assisted him with some pretty fire bars.

16:35.760 --> 16:40.760
There was very little stopping Jake from writing a perfectly serviceable song, but he ultimately chose not to,

16:40.760 --> 16:45.760
and he was also heavily involved in writing other people's verses as well, which seems strange given that they all

16:45.760 --> 16:49.760
have talent in the musical vicinity, at least on par with their wringling.

16:49.760 --> 16:53.760
The truth was that Jake assumed he knew better than everyone else, and maybe he did.

16:53.760 --> 16:57.760
Jake Paul knew that the most easily exploited market was a younger child with an internet connection,

16:57.760 --> 17:01.760
and an interest in modern culture and glamorous lifestyles, people who want to live like them,

17:01.760 --> 17:06.760
so why wouldn't he produce content that is intentionally juvenile in its presentation, yet confident in its messaging?

17:06.760 --> 17:10.760
It's the easiest way to tell a young person that, this is how you live like me.

17:10.760 --> 17:14.760
If anything, It's Everyday Bro was a statement of transparency to everyone else online,

17:14.760 --> 17:18.760
they were going to make a shit ton of money off their viewers, and there was nothing you could do about it.

17:18.760 --> 17:25.760
Barely days after people started responding to his video, he dropped God Church merch that probably did sell like a God Church.

17:25.760 --> 17:29.760
Despite his atrociousness, It's Everyday Bro quickly accumulated over 100 million views on YouTube,

17:29.760 --> 17:34.760
charted in multiple countries, and ascended to number 3 in the weekly American iTunes chart.

17:34.760 --> 17:39.760
Everyone was talking about Team 10, and nearly every member experienced exponential growth during this period,

17:39.760 --> 17:42.760
many of whom appearing on the list of YouTube's fastest growing channels.

17:42.760 --> 17:47.760
Commentators could say whatever they wanted, but it did not change the reality that Team 10 had arrived.

17:47.760 --> 17:51.760
The question is though, what do you do now all eyes are on you?

17:51.760 --> 17:55.760
My older brother, Logan Paul, probably never heard of him. He basically, um...

17:55.760 --> 17:58.760
dissed, if you could even call us that, in his YouTube video.

17:58.760 --> 18:01.760
He dissed, he dissed, It's Everyday Bro, the song, badly.

18:01.760 --> 18:03.760
Let's talk about the concept of beef.

18:03.760 --> 18:07.760
By now it was pretty clear that Team 10 were not in many people's good books,

18:07.760 --> 18:11.760
but it wasn't necessarily bad for business, particularly given there was potential for conflict between groups.

18:11.760 --> 18:14.760
Now, most of these people are not the most relevant to today's discourse,

18:14.760 --> 18:18.760
and to be frank, a lot of the drama after the song's popularity was pretty manufactured,

18:18.760 --> 18:21.760
including Jake's short-lived beef with his brother and the pop group Why Don't We,

18:21.760 --> 18:24.760
but there was something brewing beneath the surface.

18:24.760 --> 18:29.760
At the end of Logan's rather short response, you see, there is the apparent reveal of someone who is known to Jake.

18:29.760 --> 18:31.760
Who is that person?

18:45.760 --> 18:48.760
Anyway, there was this tribal element about It's Everyday Bro,

18:48.760 --> 18:51.760
and it's relationship to Team 10, a sort of chest-beating moment.

18:51.760 --> 18:56.760
And I say it's a diss to the whole of YouTube, and it is, but it was also a diss to a variety of people.

18:56.760 --> 19:01.760
Nevertheless, there is what many assume to be a very real reference to a person by the name of Alyssa Violet,

19:01.760 --> 19:03.760
and the relationship that she had with Team 10.

19:03.760 --> 19:07.760
Let's go back to 2016 briefly, when Team 10 was still in its infancy.

19:07.760 --> 19:12.760
As noted, there were a fair few members who were in and out of the house before a solid roster was assembled,

19:12.760 --> 19:15.760
but none that were likely closer to Jake than Alyssa herself.

19:15.760 --> 19:24.760
Alyssa and Jake went back, and I mean back in this sense, actually back to Jake Paul's home state of Ohio.

19:24.760 --> 19:28.760
They met at 18, both fresh out of high school, when Jake moved to LA, as did Alyssa,

19:28.760 --> 19:30.760
signing a five-year contract with Team 10.

19:30.760 --> 19:33.760
And at first, real rumours swirled about her and Jake's romantic potential,

19:33.760 --> 19:39.760
with many speculating on their relationship status, and Team 10 even marketing merchandise related to the couple's connection.

19:39.760 --> 19:44.760
However, at the start of 2017, this soured when Alyssa was abruptly removed from the Team 10 group,

19:44.760 --> 19:47.760
with Jake releasing a distraught statement alleging that she cheated on him.

19:47.760 --> 19:53.760
Alyssa adamantly denied this, and put out her own statement saying that she couldn't have cheated because they were never a legitimate couple,

19:53.760 --> 19:56.760
expressing a sentiment of betrayal that he couldn't even make such claims.

19:56.760 --> 20:02.760
One thing was for certain though, it concluded the will they, won't they saga, with a rather definite they won't.

20:02.760 --> 20:07.760
This tension persisted over the following months, with Hollywood Gossip Magazines continuing to cover the story.

20:07.760 --> 20:13.760
However, It's Everyday Bro, and the lyrics relating to what was sent at 4.52, once more placed this breakup underneath the spotlight

20:13.760 --> 20:16.760
as they appeared to be an indirect reference to their breakup.

20:16.760 --> 20:21.760
At this point, Team 10 were rather widely hated by the online world for their godawful music,

20:21.760 --> 20:25.760
but Alyssa was about to give them one more reason, or a few more at least.

20:25.760 --> 20:30.760
Alyssa- I just don't understand how someone could do that to someone. I really don't.

20:30.760 --> 20:35.760
On the 9th of June, Alyssa Viola uploaded a video entitled, What You've Been Waiting For.

20:35.760 --> 20:40.760
This video is a much more personal dissertation on her relationship with Jake, expressing that she legitimately loved him,

20:40.760 --> 20:45.760
and that she experienced serious emotional turmoil due to the fact that he regularly played with her expectations,

20:45.760 --> 20:48.760
including asking her to leave the bedroom so he could sleep with other girls.

20:48.760 --> 20:54.760
Alyssa- I'd move in with him, sleeping in the same bed, basically together at this point, but without a title.

20:54.760 --> 20:58.760
But then he would always have girls over in front of me, and I was just like, what the frick?

20:58.760 --> 21:02.760
So then we're not together. But then he would play all these mind games with me and just be like, yo, don't get mad,

21:02.760 --> 21:09.760
having a girl over. Can you do that 25,000 times? I would be in our room editing or doing something,

21:09.760 --> 21:15.760
and then all of a sudden he'd walk in and be like, yo, can you leave, please, for two hours? Can you go upstairs?

21:15.760 --> 21:19.760
Can you leave for a little bit? And I was like, why? He was like, oh, I'm having a girl over.

21:19.760 --> 21:23.760
We're gonna hang out in here. Okay. It was heartbroken. Legit heartbroken.

21:23.760 --> 21:27.760
This was a significant detail in the video, given that some of Team 10's most successful uploads at that point

21:27.760 --> 21:31.760
were content that clickbaited the speculative aspect of Jake and Alyssa's relationship.

21:31.760 --> 21:36.760
In essence, she felt used for content, and then cast aside when she wouldn't play Jake Paul's game.

21:36.760 --> 21:42.760
I finally treated him the way that he was treating me, and he didn't like it. He got pissed and kicked me out.

21:42.760 --> 21:49.760
Like, the one time I decided to be savage like him, and it ended with me being homeless.

21:49.760 --> 21:54.760
Although a footnote in a lengthy rebuke to Jake Paul, it seemed to illuminate the idea that Team 10 was living

21:54.760 --> 21:58.760
a much more manufactured lifestyle, the one that was portrayed over YouTube.

21:58.760 --> 22:03.760
The video as a whole reflected the sort of control that Jake also exerted over people who were bound to him,

22:03.760 --> 22:07.760
metaphorically and contractually, but it wasn't over yet.

22:17.760 --> 22:21.760
At the end of the day, you can't just say I'm sorry and take everything back.

22:21.760 --> 22:25.760
I'm hurt still, and you've hurt a lot of people. The damage is already done.

22:25.760 --> 22:29.760
You can't just kill someone and bring them back to life. It doesn't work like that in the real world.

22:29.760 --> 22:35.760
And I know a lot of you will be like, Alyssa, don't release that track like you're such a b****. Be the bigger person.

22:35.760 --> 22:40.760
No, I'm sorry, guys. I've been wanting to make this video for so long now. I'm very honest.

22:40.760 --> 22:43.760
If I got a boob job, I would tell you guys I got a boob job.

22:43.760 --> 22:49.760
Rice and I have been working on the song, and we put our blood, sweat, and tears into this, and I'm proud of it. I want to put it out there.

22:49.760 --> 22:54.760
Alyssa Violet's video is a bit strange in the sense that the first 14 minutes contain a lot of seemingly sincere criticism

22:54.760 --> 22:58.760
of Jake Paul and the Team 10 dynamic. However, she concludes the video with the promise of a diss rap of her own,

22:58.760 --> 23:02.760
a collaboration with then extremely popular creator and YouTube rapper RiceGum.

23:02.760 --> 23:07.760
She announced a final verse and music video would be dropping in a few days, but releases a majority of the lyrical content

23:07.760 --> 23:12.760
for the viewers to enjoy. This seemed like a strange contrast to the rest of the video, and felt more like an indulgence

23:12.760 --> 23:15.760
to the performative content that Team 10 had been participating in.

23:15.760 --> 23:20.760
Barely a day after, Jake Paul had released a response to Alyssa Violet's video where he had mostly been

23:20.760 --> 23:24.760
invasive of divulging any intimate information, dancing around subjects as a whole.

23:24.760 --> 23:29.760
He also recorded this alongside a monologue where he talks about decreasing online hate and being kinder to each other,

23:29.760 --> 23:34.760
a complete coincidence I'm sure. However, he said regardless of what came next, he would not be responding

23:34.760 --> 23:39.760
as he didn't want to deal with the drama publicly, likely aware that any engagement could bring the rest of his crew

23:39.760 --> 23:43.760
into the drama, and the possible questions it could attract about the nature of Team 10 itself.

23:43.760 --> 23:48.760
On the 11th of June, the song and music video for RiceGum and Alyssa Violet's diss track, It's Every Night Sis,

23:48.760 --> 23:53.760
dropped on Rice's YouTube channel, and, well, the least I can say is that it was better than it's everyday bro.

23:59.760 --> 24:05.760
The flow in the bars were a stark improvement on Team 10's offering, although by lyrical standards it still left a lot to be desired,

24:05.760 --> 24:10.760
with a lot of thematic repetition and couplets that didn't quite rhyme as well as they probably could.

24:10.760 --> 24:15.760
However, it was definitely designed to be a more personal attack as they harp on Jake Paul's high school history,

24:15.760 --> 24:19.760
which had been portrayed by some ex-students as being mired by ruffian and bully boy behaviour.

24:24.760 --> 24:29.760
Following this, a lot of people took the side of Alyssa, with many criticising Jake harshly in his comments section.

24:29.760 --> 24:34.760
However, the aspect of this once more being projected onto a YouTube diss rap tended to reinforce the facade

24:34.760 --> 24:39.760
of Team 10 rather than actually undermining it. Jake Paul operated over the medium of performance,

24:39.760 --> 24:44.760
and ultimately regardless of what you said over a music video, it was only going to more deeply invest people

24:44.760 --> 24:50.760
than actually rip the mask off, which is what Alyssa appeared to be trying to do throughout the majority of her initial upload.

24:50.760 --> 24:55.760
I don't know how I could love a person that treats someone like that. I don't know if I was in love with him,

24:55.760 --> 25:04.760
or the idea of him, or who I thought he was. I think I was just addicted to the pain of wanting someone so unattainable.

25:04.760 --> 25:09.760
Ultimately, in spite of the massive view count this drama generated, and testimony from a believable source,

25:09.760 --> 25:14.760
Team 10 remained largely unscathed, and continued to pump out content on a daily basis.

25:14.760 --> 25:18.760
Although Alyssa's video walked the line of tearing down the pretense of Team 10's content,

25:18.760 --> 25:24.760
it only stopped short of doing so, and instead of looking at this video of how Jake had used a person to create a reality

25:24.760 --> 25:29.760
for their channel, they tended to look at it from the context of how Jake had treated a former member of Team 10.

25:29.760 --> 25:33.760
What their image was at that time didn't matter, as long as they had the tools to pull it off,

25:33.760 --> 25:38.760
and in the coming month it became clear that there was to be an embrace of the villainous status that had been bestowed

25:38.760 --> 25:43.760
onto them by their critics. This meant more emotional, serious videos, more content addressing their own friendships

25:43.760 --> 25:48.760
and relationships, and more pranks and stunts that promised even higher stakes than the last.

25:48.760 --> 25:53.760
Eventually, the scope of what Team 10 were aspiring for in their little fantasy world began to have implications

25:53.760 --> 25:54.760
for the rest of planet Earth.

25:54.760 --> 25:55.760
I'm cramping!

25:55.760 --> 25:56.760
Yo, I don't know who won.

25:56.760 --> 25:57.760
I need help, Chance!

25:57.760 --> 25:58.760
You gotta hand me!

25:58.760 --> 26:00.760
I don't know, bro, we need to fix it!

26:00.760 --> 26:01.760
We need to replay!

26:01.760 --> 26:02.760
Cut it! Call for it! Call for it!

26:02.760 --> 26:03.760
Replay!

26:03.760 --> 26:09.760
As you're likely aware, Team 10 had a house. Unlike many houses, it was in a neighbourhood, which unsurprisingly,

26:10.760 --> 26:16.760
was not full of young people looking to party, and as Team 10's antics gradually escalated, so did the negative aspect

26:16.760 --> 26:21.760
of those in the real world. In the month following, their house hosted a multitude of stunts that generated multiple

26:21.760 --> 26:26.760
complaints about his behaviour, as many online maligned him, Team 10 seemed to lean into its status,

26:26.760 --> 26:31.760
with Jake being the main spokesperson for them, continuing to be a nuisance even when other people in the real world

26:31.760 --> 26:33.760
tried to consult him about it.

26:33.760 --> 26:37.760
Jake, I wouldn't do that. I wouldn't crawl up there.

26:37.760 --> 26:38.760
Why?

26:38.760 --> 26:39.760
I just wouldn't do that.

26:39.760 --> 26:42.760
A lot of the neighbours are complaining, they're very upset.

26:42.760 --> 26:43.760
No, why?

26:43.760 --> 26:49.760
They say that you've created a living hell out here, that it's like a circus.

26:49.760 --> 26:50.760
Yeah, it is.

26:50.760 --> 26:51.760
All the fans.

26:51.760 --> 26:53.760
I mean, but people like going to circuses, right?

26:53.760 --> 26:57.760
Interviews with the mainstream media had gone from these relaxed dialogues to borderline bedlam.

26:57.760 --> 27:01.760
Drama that had previously been contained within the YouTube platform was spilling over in all directions,

27:01.760 --> 27:05.760
and everyone continued to amplify its coverage over the entirety of social media.

27:05.760 --> 27:10.760
Team 10 obviously enjoyed continued strong viewership over this period, however, there were real world

27:10.760 --> 27:15.760
consequences for this publicity, the most notable being Disney's decision to sever ties with Jake Paul,

27:15.760 --> 27:21.760
ending his work on Bizaardvark, further enshrining this image as this out of control celebrity with a gang of hooligans.

27:21.760 --> 27:28.760
He's just going around like a wrecking ball, being an absolute douchebag to people in public,

27:28.760 --> 27:35.760
and everything that he does, he's just like this fucking ego-brained, just has no perception of what it's like

27:35.760 --> 27:39.760
to be a respectful, decent human being in society.

27:39.760 --> 27:45.760
And, you know, Jake Paulers would call that savage, you know, dab on those motherfucking haters,

27:45.760 --> 27:47.760
I call it being a fucking loser.

27:47.760 --> 27:50.760
That's just how I was raised.

27:50.760 --> 27:55.760
Jake Paul said there wouldn't be a response to Alyssa Violet, but in a way, the heightened stunts and the consequences

27:55.760 --> 27:58.760
that resulted from Team 10's involvement in them were just that.

27:58.760 --> 28:02.760
It was a statement of legitimacy that sought to invalidate the criticism that Team 10 were just another

28:02.760 --> 28:08.760
flash in the pan collective coasting off their 15 minutes of fame, but could they ever fully avert that?

28:08.760 --> 28:14.760
Not everything that you see in the media on a day-to-day basis is real, and that you could basically fake anything

28:14.760 --> 28:17.760
and twist everything the way you want.

28:19.760 --> 28:23.760
Understanding what made Team 10 tick requires an understanding of the actual power dynamics between Jake

28:23.760 --> 28:28.760
and the rest of the crew members. By that should have been apparent, the Team 10 didn't exist because they were all besties.

28:28.760 --> 28:33.760
This was a business venture, and led at the helm by an intrepid influencer who was willing to put everything at stake

28:33.760 --> 28:38.760
for the success of it. Jake Paul had outwardly stated his intent multiple times to create a network which would

28:38.760 --> 28:43.760
maintain a hierarchy of younger talent beneath him, and at the time Team 10 appeared to be a model that would

28:43.760 --> 28:46.760
optimise that. However, were the cracks starting to show?

28:46.760 --> 28:50.760
As aforementioned, there are many benefits to working within a group, particularly when curating fandoms

28:50.760 --> 28:54.760
who want to see personalities building off each other, the monetisation of such networks is incredibly

28:54.760 --> 28:59.760
lucrative for all those involved. This income is typically a motivator to keep these sets of people together,

28:59.760 --> 29:04.760
but at the same time, if a collective becomes too popular, then individual members may feel that it is in their best interest

29:04.760 --> 29:09.760
to go solo. Jake Paul had to walk a tightrope of making Team 10 famous enough to be a worthy investment,

29:09.760 --> 29:14.760
but also reliant on him for that fame to the extent that people wouldn't just walk out. The members themselves

29:14.760 --> 29:19.760
would have felt empowered by the success of Team 10, but also somewhat hesitant to change the status quo,

29:19.760 --> 29:24.760
out of fear that their prosperity may not carry over into their solo ventures, and who can blame them given the many

29:24.760 --> 29:26.760
techniques that Jake himself employed.

29:26.760 --> 29:54.760
Although he obviously wanted the presence of Team 10 for his many antics, in interviews he would still be quite

29:54.760 --> 30:00.760
possessive over the fandom, even when surrounded by his peers, you'd hear the term Jake Paulers rather than Team Teners.

30:00.760 --> 30:06.760
Now, the former does roll off the tongue better, but that's not the reason why he uses the term, in this case it's all about

30:06.760 --> 30:11.760
control. It's the same reason he used his main personal channel to upload a significant amount of Team 10 content,

30:11.760 --> 30:17.760
he wanted to conflate the success of Team 10 with his own, so there was a sense of dependency on Jake.

30:17.760 --> 30:22.760
He didn't want people to just join, acquire success, and leave, but now as someone who did just that, and being

30:22.760 --> 30:28.760
noticeably vocal about it, there was a sense that maybe this structure that Paul had set up was looking somewhat fragile.

30:28.760 --> 30:33.760
Although simultaneously being the public and private face of a business may have seemed like an advantageous position

30:33.760 --> 30:38.760
at the start of Team 10, as it enabled a close relationship with the public perception, it also eventually made him

30:38.760 --> 30:43.760
quite vulnerable, particularly when he became infamous amongst online communities, and it became beneficial for people

30:43.760 --> 30:48.760
to talk shit about him. There are many managers in the industry who are real disciplinarians, for many it's seen as a

30:48.760 --> 30:54.760
standard for them to maintain a public image, I'm sure there are some who are quite unpopular for it, but for Jake,

30:54.760 --> 31:00.760
when his public image was skewered, so was his private enterprise, influencers are far less likely to go on record and

31:00.760 --> 31:04.760
complain about a corporate executive. Jake Paul on the other hand was a prime target.

31:04.760 --> 31:09.760
By making a video on the matter and the subsequent diss track with RiceGum, Alyssa Violet seems to set a precedent for the

31:09.760 --> 31:16.760
attention that could be generated just by leaving, and aligning herself with those who may be hostile to Team 10 and Jake Paul.

31:16.760 --> 31:21.760
At the same time, she also had reduced the novelty of such an action, and actually appeared to possess legitimate

31:21.760 --> 31:26.760
justification for it, so even though there may be some who seem tempted to walk away, Jake's newfound commitment

31:26.760 --> 31:31.760
to the image of Team 10 may have won them over for the moment, but how much could Jake do to convince them that

31:31.760 --> 31:32.760
they were better together?

31:37.760 --> 31:42.760
Well let's talk about loyalty, it's clearly a trait that Jake Paul values in a team member, provided that the loyalty

31:42.760 --> 31:47.760
is to him and not from him. Generally, that was presented as the reason that Alyssa Violet had been ejected from

31:47.760 --> 31:52.760
the house in the first place. Come August, it appeared she had properly moved on from Team 10, and had entered into a

31:52.760 --> 31:57.760
relationship with the content creator FaZe Banks, who was also heavily enshrined in the Los Angeles scene.

31:57.760 --> 32:02.760
Despite supposedly referring to her in It's Everyday Bro, Jake has since made a point of not addressing her,

32:02.760 --> 32:08.760
leading with a peace and love philosophy that was always evident in his content. On August 18th, he put out a post

32:08.760 --> 32:13.760
on his Twitter, appearing to show remorse for his actions over the past few months. He stated that he had learned

32:13.760 --> 32:18.760
that words could indeed be very powerful, and that he would be more mindful of his words going forward.

32:18.760 --> 32:23.760
What was his reason for doing this? Was it a heavy issue weighing on his conscience?

32:23.760 --> 32:24.760
Well.

32:24.760 --> 32:35.760
Long story short of it is that Meg was assaulted by a man last night, who is in the same community and space as us.

32:35.760 --> 32:40.760
And it's not like, if you guys see, she literally has a bruise, I don't know if you can see on camera, like here,

32:40.760 --> 32:44.760
not to be like dramatic, but like she literally has a bruise on the side of the whole entire neck.

32:44.760 --> 32:50.760
The same day, you see, Jake released a video titled, My Assistant Was Assaulted. A pretty serious accusation,

32:50.760 --> 32:55.760
once again it was embedded in a standard vlog, so there's lots of typical shenanigans before this sobering sit down

32:55.760 --> 33:00.760
with the solemn faces and the still camera, where Jake discloses more details relating to this incident,

33:00.760 --> 33:02.760
including the alleged perpetrator.

33:02.760 --> 33:10.760
When I was leaving, he sort of clotheslined me and put their arm out in front of me, and tried to like pull me

33:10.760 --> 33:16.760
into the place that they were, into his table. I was looking up at him and our faces were really close,

33:16.760 --> 33:18.760
and he sort of like was right here.

33:18.760 --> 33:23.760
I feel like it was more extreme. He didn't know you, doesn't know you.

33:23.760 --> 33:28.760
I've never met him before, I just know who he is because he's well known in our same community.

33:28.760 --> 33:32.760
In this video, Jake and his peers explain that during his assistant's outing to the club,

33:32.760 --> 33:37.760
she'd spotted FaZe Banks making out with a girl who wasn't Alyssa, and then while on her way back from the bathroom,

33:37.760 --> 33:42.760
she'd run into Banks who clotheslined her, leaving a very noticeable bruise on her neck.

33:42.760 --> 33:47.760
The thing is though, it's not even internet beef. He doesn't even know who Meg is.

33:47.760 --> 33:48.760
Meg is behind the scenes.

33:48.760 --> 33:54.760
Literally, it just so happens that she is my assistant and works here.

33:54.760 --> 34:00.760
And so, what's crazy about this is that if it wasn't her, this message would have never been spread.

34:00.760 --> 34:05.760
This type of thing could have kept on happening. It could have spiralled into a lot worse things.

34:05.760 --> 34:09.760
It just sickens me, but I don't know if there's more to the story.

34:10.760 --> 34:15.760
Jake quickly dismisses ideas that this has anything to do with Team 10's ongoing disputes with Banks and Alyssa,

34:15.760 --> 34:19.760
stating there was no way that Banks could have even recognised his assistant to the club,

34:19.760 --> 34:21.760
and that this could have happened to any female.

34:21.760 --> 34:26.760
Jake Paul was just standing up for women all around the world.

34:26.760 --> 34:31.760
This video isn't meant to retaliate or target anyone.

34:31.760 --> 34:36.760
It's not about that. It's not about revenge or starting a drama or beef or anything.

34:36.760 --> 34:42.760
It's about how important this message is to get out there, and we're trying to figure out the situation.

34:42.760 --> 34:44.760
But what was he really doing?

35:03.760 --> 35:05.760
This was a very serious charge being made about a public figure.

35:05.760 --> 35:12.760
Nick DM'd the person, police are involved, there's proof, thankfully there's cameras at this club,

35:12.760 --> 35:19.760
and we are going to stop this and have justice and let the police take it from here,

35:19.760 --> 35:24.760
and they're the professionals, they can handle it, but overall this situation just sucks.

35:24.760 --> 35:29.760
It was provided even more credibility by the fact that it had come from number one feminist Jake Paul.

35:29.760 --> 35:32.760
Additionally, Nick Crompton tweeted a screenshot to substantiate this,

35:33.760 --> 35:37.760
adding that the police had been informed that Team 10 would never, ever lie to their fans.

35:37.760 --> 35:40.760
However, this statement would be brought into question by FaZe Banks himself,

35:40.760 --> 35:43.760
who would soon post a video response the following day.

35:43.760 --> 35:47.760
With the title My Girlfriend Was Assaulted, he elaborates on the screenshot that Nick Crompton had posted,

35:47.760 --> 35:49.760
showing that there was missing context to the message.

35:49.760 --> 35:52.760
He said to me somewhere along the lines of,

35:52.760 --> 35:56.760
she said she knows you didn't do it on purpose, so she doesn't think you did it on purpose,

35:56.760 --> 35:59.760
but my assistant was at Warwick last night, it's a club in LA,

35:59.760 --> 36:03.760
and you were there as well, and she walked by your table, and you like clotheslined her,

36:03.760 --> 36:06.760
or did something, and you left this bruise on her neck.

36:06.760 --> 36:09.760
So right here, Nick has lost all credibility.

36:09.760 --> 36:14.760
Now, of course, it's very possible that a person can reflect on an event and change their mind about an individual's intentions,

36:14.760 --> 36:17.760
but with all the intersecting factors, including Jake's ongoing feud with Melissa,

36:17.760 --> 36:22.760
and the rather ham-fisted narrative surrounding women's rights, and being more considerate in general,

36:22.760 --> 36:28.760
it felt like this was another rather calculated move to vilify a person who was finding success outside of Jake's incubator project.

36:28.760 --> 36:31.760
Additionally, given that it was completely separate to the allegation of the clothesline,

36:31.760 --> 36:35.760
the detail of FaZe Banks supposedly making out with a woman who wasn't Alyssa,

36:35.760 --> 36:39.760
seemed like a twist of the knife into a person who had not been loyal to their beloved team.

36:39.760 --> 36:44.760
There was no real way to avoid the fact that this seemed much more personally motivated than it had been presented.

36:44.760 --> 36:51.760
If there was genuine concern, why would you air out that information in a public forum before talking to the affected party first?

36:51.760 --> 36:54.760
I never thought that anybody could lie about something like this.

36:54.760 --> 36:58.760
So initially, I responded with, wait, what? Who is that? I've never seen this person ever.

36:58.760 --> 37:04.760
I don't remember having any interaction with this person, and this is the first time I have ever seen this human being in my life,

37:04.760 --> 37:07.760
and it's a picture of a bruise on her neck, and I'm being told that I caused the bruise.

37:07.760 --> 37:12.760
So I responded, I said, oh my God, holy shit, I don't remember doing that.

37:12.760 --> 37:19.760
I don't think, I never saw her, but obviously if I did do it, it was on accident, 100% on accident, and I'm sorry.

37:19.760 --> 37:23.760
And I asked for her on Twitter, and I tried to get in touch with her, to which Nick didn't respond to any of that.

37:23.760 --> 37:28.760
In Banks' video, he goes into more details about this incident, explaining that he had attempted to reconcile

37:28.760 --> 37:33.760
nearly immediately, but was not given any route to do this. Banks also provided eyewitness testimony from two of his friends

37:33.760 --> 37:39.760
who were also at the establishment that night, which were both very differing accounts to the one presented by Jake Paul in his video,

37:39.760 --> 37:44.760
both of whom confirmed there was no way that he would have ever made out with another girl, and that any physical incident

37:44.760 --> 37:48.760
with Jake Paul's assistant was completely unintentional, though he doubts whether it even happened now.

37:48.760 --> 37:54.760
I suggest that it was a possibility that members of Team 10 had spiked his drinks in an attempt to engineer the situation.

37:54.760 --> 37:58.760
I'm sitting there minding my own business, I'm speaking to Naija, which you've seen, you're talking to Naija.

37:58.760 --> 38:04.760
I look over at Naija, and I look back behind me, and the kid, they have you up, and you're not even paying attention to who you're making eye contact to,

38:04.760 --> 38:09.760
and you're drinking out of the thing, and they're like, keep, keep, keep, for the next five minutes, keep feeding you alcohol.

38:09.760 --> 38:11.760
And they were trying to just get you.

38:11.760 --> 38:12.760
They were trying to get you complete.

38:12.760 --> 38:13.760
Kids from Team 10, by the way.

38:13.760 --> 38:14.760
Blacked out.

38:15.760 --> 38:17.760
These kids actually did something to me.

38:17.760 --> 38:23.760
Like, I really truly, in my heart, believe that these kids drugged me, or just got me way beyond drunk,

38:23.760 --> 38:26.760
and obviously with intent, they told you they were trying to get me blacked out.

38:26.760 --> 38:32.760
As you're likely aware, the video didn't end there, and Banks and Alissa proceeded to go into more depth about the relationship with Jake and Alissa,

38:32.760 --> 38:36.760
revealing details that even many neutral parties would label as abusive.

38:36.760 --> 38:40.760
Honestly, he did assault me a few times.

38:40.760 --> 38:46.760
If we never agreed on something, or if something happened, he would spit in my face, and this has happened multiple times.

38:46.760 --> 38:49.760
He would, like, spit at, like, my feet, the ground that I walk on.

38:49.760 --> 38:51.760
Another time, he threw my phone.

38:51.760 --> 38:55.760
Neil's was there, too, at this one, too, and surprisingly enough, Alex Lane was there at this one, too.

38:55.760 --> 39:00.760
When I was living in his apartment, he took my phone, threw it at the wall, we got into a fight, I ran upstairs,

39:00.760 --> 39:04.760
he dragged me down the f***ing stairs, and I actually have-

39:04.760 --> 39:06.760
Yeah, that's been on your leg since I met you.

39:06.760 --> 39:09.760
This has been here for, like, two f***ing years, dude.

39:09.760 --> 39:14.760
Today's Banks concludes the response, stating that he will be suing Jake Paul and Team 10 for defamation of character.

39:14.760 --> 39:18.760
In the coming days, there were further responses from all sides trying to shield their reputations,

39:18.760 --> 39:22.760
including Logan as well, who sat down with his brother to go over their side of the story.

39:22.760 --> 39:27.760
Eventually, Jake walked back his statements and expressed how he was actually all about positivity now,

39:27.760 --> 39:29.760
and that this would be resolved in private.

39:29.760 --> 39:35.760
...to handle the situation, and so I reached out to Banks directly, over text message, and we're communicating now,

39:35.760 --> 39:40.760
and we are going to meet up, figure out how to solve this situation, we're stopping the drama, guys.

39:40.760 --> 39:45.760
However, this was not the end for Banks, who decided to release another video titled Proof I'm Innocent.

39:45.760 --> 39:48.760
This included an interview with a person by the name of Max Beaumont.

39:48.760 --> 39:53.760
Max Beaumont was a member of Team 10 who had been speculated as the individual who may or may not have spiked

39:53.760 --> 39:58.760
FaZe Banks' drink. However, amidst all the conjecture, he abruptly decided to leave the Team 10 house,

39:58.760 --> 40:01.760
stating that he would be returning to college for a normal life.

40:01.760 --> 40:06.760
After calling his departure, he sat down with FaZe Banks over a phone call to help clear up the events of the night.

40:06.760 --> 40:10.760
Do you, as a person who has seen this all go down, as somebody who was there that night,

40:10.760 --> 40:16.760
between me and you, everything that you've consumed about the situation thus far, do you believe that I did this?

40:16.760 --> 40:20.760
I do not believe that you intentionally assaulted this girl.

40:20.760 --> 40:25.760
I believe that, if anything, you accidentally bumped into her.

40:25.760 --> 40:30.760
I can't explain the bruise, and she's my best friend for seven years, so it's so hard for me to say this,

40:30.760 --> 40:36.760
but the way that I saw you that night, I do not see how it was a possibility that you went from this nice guy

40:36.760 --> 40:40.760
who came over and gave me a hug to someone who started swinging at her afterwards.

40:40.760 --> 40:42.760
That's my personal opinion.

40:42.760 --> 40:45.760
And just one more thing, do you believe that I kissed somebody that night?

40:45.760 --> 40:46.760
No.

40:46.760 --> 40:49.760
He echoes Banks' retelling, stating that he did not see Banks cheat on anyone,

40:49.760 --> 40:53.760
and that he also did not witness any physical incident occur with Jake Paul's assistant,

40:53.760 --> 40:57.760
writing additional third-party testimony contradictory to that of Jake Paul and his crew.

40:57.760 --> 41:00.760
Now, some probably said that he was trying to ease any tensions with Banks,

41:00.760 --> 41:02.760
given that his name had been brought up in relation to the incident.

41:02.760 --> 41:05.760
Declaring Banks' name was the best way to clear his own name.

41:05.760 --> 41:08.760
At the same time, Beaumont was one of the founding members of the team,

41:08.760 --> 41:13.760
he had been there for a very long time, and he seemed to lose a lot more from walking away from Team 10,

41:13.760 --> 41:17.760
and repudiating the testimony of someone who he clearly considered to be a close friend.

41:17.760 --> 41:21.760
Everyone knows how fleeting drama is online, and his name was only brought up in passing.

41:22.760 --> 41:27.760
Hey man, I'm Max, I'm from Team 10, and his Instagram, it'll pop up right now, it's whoismax, right?

41:27.760 --> 41:28.760
Whoismax, his name's whoismax.

41:28.760 --> 41:32.760
This and the prior video did make a dent in the subscriber count of Paul and co,

41:32.760 --> 41:34.760
with many siding against the infamous squad,

41:34.760 --> 41:39.760
which is such a shock after Jake Paul was so determined to drop the issue and be all about peace and love.

41:39.760 --> 41:42.760
We weren't handling the situation the right way.

41:42.760 --> 41:44.760
But the truth is, it's not an issue of being positive.

41:44.760 --> 41:47.760
If someone was assaulted, it would be quite a pressing matter,

41:47.760 --> 41:50.760
and the police would be contacted if you felt it needed to be addressed.

41:50.760 --> 41:53.760
It's an issue of honesty, and actually making sure that if an incident has occurred,

41:53.760 --> 41:57.760
the facts are established so all relevant and proportionate action can be taken.

41:57.760 --> 42:01.760
I don't think the video's existence was unjustified if Paul believed what he was saying,

42:01.760 --> 42:05.760
but as the situation continued to transpire, and more details were revealed,

42:05.760 --> 42:07.760
it became increasingly difficult to believe.

42:07.760 --> 42:09.760
So what was the reason behind all of this?

42:09.760 --> 42:14.760
We can assume it was personally motivated, but what would that personal motivation be?

42:14.760 --> 42:16.760
I didn't really know whether or not it was him at first,

42:16.760 --> 42:22.760
because he has a girlfriend, and he was making out with this other girl that I knew wasn't his girlfriend.

42:22.760 --> 42:25.760
So at first I was confused, but then I realised it was definitely him.

42:25.760 --> 42:27.760
Well, let's talk about it.

42:33.760 --> 42:36.760
There are loads of self-interested reasons to start drama with a person.

42:36.760 --> 42:41.760
Most of the time it doesn't happen because the cons of manufactured drama sufficiently outweigh the pros.

42:41.760 --> 42:44.760
But in the case of Jake Paul, whether the allegations were true or false,

42:44.760 --> 42:46.760
he had more than enough motive to stir the pot.

42:46.760 --> 42:51.760
Part of it is factualism, Jake Paul's prime directive is to appeal to his audience and Team 10.

42:51.760 --> 42:56.760
Outside the women's rights narrative, him speaking up makes it look like he is standing up for someone close to him.

42:56.760 --> 43:01.760
Not only is this demonstrative loyalty to the people in his life, but also for those who trust his intentions.

43:01.760 --> 43:04.760
This is the most notable thing a guy can do for his friends and colleagues,

43:04.760 --> 43:07.760
so on one hand he has demonstrated his allegiance to his team.

43:07.760 --> 43:10.760
However, that wasn't the only reason, and I call back to the question I asked earlier.

43:10.760 --> 43:16.760
Why would you include the detail of your ex's boyfriend cheating on her if it doesn't actually substantiate your initial allegation?

43:16.760 --> 43:20.760
Sure, the clothesline incident was good motivation for a video addressing this issue at hand,

43:20.760 --> 43:22.760
but I think there's one big reason that detail existed.

43:25.760 --> 43:31.760
We call back to Jake's plans of creating a major creator network where he works as a quasi-mentor for many creators,

43:31.760 --> 43:33.760
facilitating their success on YouTube.

43:33.760 --> 43:37.760
It's not an uncommon position to aspire for, but I don't think he does it out of altruism.

43:37.760 --> 43:43.760
For a person who likely gives himself a lot more credit than he should, he always expects something in return, that loyalty.

43:43.760 --> 43:49.760
What looked like an act of loyalty for Team 10 was actually an attempted punishment of disloyalty to Alyssa Violet,

43:49.760 --> 43:54.760
provoking an aspect of factualism to show that those who did leave Team 10 would not just be joining the enemy,

43:54.760 --> 43:57.760
but an enemy that had actively sought to harm Jake and his friends.

43:57.760 --> 44:02.760
That's a difficult position for any member of Team 10 to come to terms with, but now it is significantly backfired,

44:02.760 --> 44:06.760
and there was a sense that this situation had been used for much more insidious reasons.

44:06.760 --> 44:10.760
A member of Team 10 had walked out of the house, and their credibility was wearing thin.

44:10.760 --> 44:14.760
On the surface, Jake may have been trying to show more loyalty and commitment to Team 10,

44:14.760 --> 44:18.760
but the contrience of this drama could not masquerade itself behind the very apparent truth,

44:18.760 --> 44:23.760
that Jake was playing Game of Thrones, and its schtick was beginning to tie.

44:23.760 --> 44:26.760
Jake, what do you think about the It's Every Night Sis song?

44:26.760 --> 44:27.760
What is it?

44:27.760 --> 44:30.760
It's Every Night Sis with rice gum?

44:30.760 --> 44:32.760
Oh, I think it's great, man.

44:35.760 --> 44:39.760
I just claimed the views on it, I'm gonna buy a new car with it.

44:39.760 --> 44:45.760
Jake's continued anger towards people who left Team 10, yet inability to change or prevent it would confuse many reasonable onlookers,

44:45.760 --> 44:50.760
but unfortunately most of the people who actually cared enough to spectate were not in a reasonable frame of mind.

44:50.760 --> 44:54.760
Over August and September, there was this sense once again that Jake Paul was trying to be real.

44:54.760 --> 44:58.760
This began with a diss track to himself, which on the surface may have seemed like a legitimate self-reflection,

44:58.760 --> 45:02.760
but more just included him presenting his own perspective on recent matters,

45:02.760 --> 45:05.760
and once more taking passing shots of former members.

45:15.760 --> 45:18.760
It began very hard to almost hide the fragility of one man,

45:18.760 --> 45:24.760
and how his fame as an individual, Crater, and his greater aspirations were continuously compromised by the actions of others.

45:24.760 --> 45:29.760
This is a man who had given these people everything, and yet time and time again people kept walking away,

45:29.760 --> 45:31.760
despite the fact that he treated them like family.

45:31.760 --> 45:34.760
And when reflecting on where many of the founding members were now,

45:34.760 --> 45:38.760
there seemed to be this growing list of alumni who had just vanished from the crew's vlogs.

45:38.760 --> 45:42.760
No big thank yous, no glorious send off, even the people who had supposedly left on amicable terms,

45:42.760 --> 45:45.760
one day they were there, the next day they weren't.

45:45.760 --> 45:50.760
Most of the time you'd find out from a video on their own channel, or if Jake Paul dropped a diss on them somewhere.

45:50.760 --> 45:54.760
If Jake treated these people like family, I'd hate to see how he treated his family.

45:54.760 --> 45:58.760
In a way, when someone left the house for good, Jake seemed too embarrassed to even admit that it happened.

45:58.760 --> 46:04.760
Team 10 had to look like this indomitable frat house fortress to any outsider's sources, where the banter never ends.

46:04.760 --> 46:08.760
He was also aware of how the media would latch onto an exit en masse,

46:08.760 --> 46:13.760
how one person leaving could easily provoke copycat incidents, and how he had to do everything to prevent it.

46:13.760 --> 46:19.760
However, he couldn't help letting his personal biases seep into the content because that's also how he maximised the potential of his personality.

46:19.760 --> 46:24.760
Jake Paul was allowed to be weak, he was allowed to be human, that's what made him appeal to the viewers,

46:24.760 --> 46:28.760
talking about peace and love and his own personal struggles and being a decent person,

46:28.760 --> 46:33.760
but when Team 10 activities ensued, it could never truly fail, even when cars were smashed,

46:37.760 --> 46:39.760
even when fires were sent,

46:43.760 --> 46:45.760
even when members were injured.

46:57.760 --> 47:04.760
It could not afford to fail, but in doing so, Jake Paul split his persona down the middle and created a recipe for disaster.

47:04.760 --> 47:10.760
What do I mean? Well, not too long after the loss of founding member Max Beaumont, a more fiery exit would follow.

47:11.760 --> 47:16.760
So, let's talk about two very curious characters, known as the Martinez Twins.

47:16.760 --> 47:22.760
The Martinez Twins joined Team 10 in early 2017, appearing to serve as a proxy replacement to the Dolan Twins,

47:22.760 --> 47:25.760
who some had speculated on Jake's relationship with after they had collaborated.

47:25.760 --> 47:29.760
In many ways, given their unique background to the rest of the team and their brotherly camaraderie,

47:29.760 --> 47:33.760
the Martinez Twins quickly became fan favourites in the hearts of many Jake Paulers.

47:33.760 --> 47:39.760
They had this sort of wide-eyed innocence and energy that complemented the edgier presence of people like Jake and Piers,

47:39.760 --> 47:43.760
more seasoned with these group antics. On the surface, they seemed to be living their dream,

47:43.760 --> 47:47.760
but it did beckon one question, what happens when you're not in on the joke?

47:53.760 --> 47:57.760
The Martinez Twins were sort of at the forefront of the new era of Team 10,

47:57.760 --> 48:01.760
making a rather notable appearance on It's Everyday Bro, and spinning super hot fire lyrics.

48:01.760 --> 48:05.760
They appeared to be a part and parcel of the team's pranks and japes, however, around September,

48:05.760 --> 48:07.760
they began to act a little out of character.

48:10.760 --> 48:17.760
First came a diss track that appeared to be directed at some of their comrades,

48:17.760 --> 48:20.760
however, you could easily perceive that as a joke and move on.

48:20.760 --> 48:23.760
Not too long after, in October though, they flew back to Spain,

48:23.760 --> 48:27.760
and their future with Team 10 appeared uncertain while they struggled to obtain visas.

48:27.760 --> 48:29.760
They were designed to return regardless at the start of November,

48:29.760 --> 48:33.760
but accompanied by a video that revealed that they would not be residing in the Team 10 house anymore.

48:33.760 --> 48:38.760
Many Team 10 fans seemed disappointed by this, expressing that they would be most welcome there,

48:38.760 --> 48:41.760
but more perceptive viewers probably realised something was up,

48:41.760 --> 48:45.760
and barely a week after came a further video that was posted on their channel titled,

48:45.760 --> 48:46.760
We Left Jake Paul's Team.

48:46.760 --> 48:50.760
On the surface, this video could have a plethora of interpretations,

48:50.760 --> 48:53.760
by now, clickbait was so second nature to the genre of content,

48:53.760 --> 48:56.760
that they could have just been going on a day trip to Disney without the rest of the crew.

48:56.760 --> 49:01.760
Once the video starts, you realise that this title actually does exactly what it says on the tin.

49:01.760 --> 49:08.760
So, guys, we're no longer with Team 10.

49:08.760 --> 49:13.760
In this unmonetised upload, they reveal that they have indeed departed the notorious posse,

49:13.760 --> 49:15.760
but are seemingly vague about the details behind this.

49:15.760 --> 49:19.760
With that said, from what one can gleam, the message of the video was that they had joined Team 10

49:19.760 --> 49:23.760
under the pretense that it would be a very different experience to the one they subsequently received.

49:23.760 --> 49:28.760
They felt that their naivety was taken advantage of by many of those in the team who found them an easy target to pick on,

49:28.760 --> 49:30.760
deeply given how they were not fluent with their language.

49:30.760 --> 49:33.760
However, as they became more familiar with the world in LA,

49:33.760 --> 49:36.760
they became more disillusioned with what was offered to them.

49:36.760 --> 49:40.760
And we went there, and it was like Team 10.

49:40.760 --> 49:42.760
We didn't know about Team 10 before that.

49:42.760 --> 49:45.760
We were like, yo, they're the same people like us.

49:45.760 --> 49:49.760
They do the same as we do, and we can make content together.

49:49.760 --> 49:51.760
We can have fun together.

49:51.760 --> 49:56.760
We thought they could be our family, but not anymore.

49:57.760 --> 49:58.760
You wake us up.

49:58.760 --> 50:00.760
You just wake us up.

50:00.760 --> 50:01.760
We're awake now.

50:01.760 --> 50:02.760
We know everything.

50:02.760 --> 50:04.760
We know we're used.

50:04.760 --> 50:05.760
He's awake.

50:05.760 --> 50:06.760
I'm awake too.

50:06.760 --> 50:07.760
And we're pissed.

50:07.760 --> 50:08.760
We're really pissed.

50:08.760 --> 50:09.760
Yeah, bro.

50:09.760 --> 50:10.760
Okay?

50:10.760 --> 50:11.760
Because you're a bully.

50:11.760 --> 50:13.760
If this video gets just one like.

50:13.760 --> 50:14.760
One like?

50:14.760 --> 50:15.760
Take.

50:15.760 --> 50:17.760
I used to love you.

50:17.760 --> 50:18.760
For real.

50:18.760 --> 50:19.760
I will do the like.

50:19.760 --> 50:20.760
I will do the like.

50:20.760 --> 50:21.760
No, you don't have to.

50:21.760 --> 50:23.760
If this video gets just one like.

50:23.760 --> 50:24.760
One like.

50:24.760 --> 50:25.760
I will tell them.

50:25.760 --> 50:26.760
Just one like.

50:26.760 --> 50:28.760
I will tell them.

50:28.760 --> 50:30.760
Everything about you.

50:30.760 --> 50:34.760
They conclude the upload with a firm commitment that if the video received one like, they

50:34.760 --> 50:37.760
intended to reveal everything about their experience with Team 10 and Jake Paul.

50:37.760 --> 50:41.760
Before they could, however, Team 10 posted a response to their Twitter, claiming that

50:41.760 --> 50:46.060
what the Martinez Twins had alleged in their upload was simply not true, along with numerous

50:46.060 --> 50:48.760
other comments expressing bemusement at this sudden betrayal.

50:48.760 --> 50:53.560
A series of responses from members followed over the coming days, expressing similar sentiments,

50:53.560 --> 50:57.260
including Jake Paul's parents, in what looked to be a blitz of uploads in an attempt to

50:57.260 --> 50:59.060
discredit their claim.

50:59.060 --> 51:04.160
We all love the Martinez Twins, we all are just shocked, no team member that I've talked

51:04.160 --> 51:10.760
to understands what's going on, and it's quite devastated.

51:10.760 --> 51:13.880
They were an integral part of the team.

51:13.880 --> 51:17.440
The Martinez Twins then hit back, alluding to the idea that there would be more on the

51:17.440 --> 51:18.940
way, and indeed there was.

51:18.940 --> 51:22.400
On November the 14th, we were blessed with another longer upload that went into more

51:22.400 --> 51:25.920
depth about the Martinez Twins ordeal at the hands of Jake Paul and the rest of Team

51:25.920 --> 51:30.480
10, supported by video evidence posted by Team 10 and Jake Paul themselves.

51:30.480 --> 51:36.040
Like Jake started to prank us every single day, we were in a room, so he started to prank

51:36.040 --> 51:37.840
us every single day.

51:37.840 --> 51:45.880
Like we felt so bad, like we were the only ones getting pranked, like the other ones,

51:45.880 --> 51:51.000
they didn't get pranked at all, and we were getting pranked every single day because we

51:51.000 --> 51:56.840
didn't say anything bad to him, we were like, okay yeah, fine, fine, fine, but when you're

51:56.840 --> 52:01.440
like fine, fine, fine, all the time, they can do whatever you want, they can do whatever

52:01.440 --> 52:02.440
you want to you.

52:02.440 --> 52:05.440
When the aforementioned clips were originally uploaded, I think viewers always assume that

52:05.440 --> 52:08.900
there is some sort of balance that ensures that nobody is disproportionately subject

52:08.900 --> 52:12.980
to Team 10's pranks, and there is this sort of understood respect and consent to those

52:12.980 --> 52:14.040
things happening.

52:14.040 --> 52:17.120
Have the Martinez Twins assert that they were just too inexperienced with the culture to

52:17.120 --> 52:20.720
actually have a choice in what was going on with their lives, they had met Jake, he had

52:20.760 --> 52:24.560
encouraged them to come over to the United States to LA, a place thousands of miles away,

52:24.560 --> 52:28.320
of which they didn't even speak the language, just to turn them into routine punching bags

52:28.320 --> 52:29.320
for channel view.

52:29.320 --> 52:35.860
And it was like the first month on Team 10, it started getting worse, they started talking

52:35.860 --> 52:42.120
bad about us, because it was funny for them, he said to us, he was saying to us all the

52:42.120 --> 52:50.160
time, Binner, like, we found out what was Binner, and we were like, how he's joking

52:50.160 --> 52:56.400
about that, like, he cannot joke about that, he was saying to us, Binner, and there's in

52:56.400 --> 53:05.220
blogs that he's calling us Martinez, Martinez, no Martinez, Martinez, so Martinez is like

53:05.220 --> 53:10.840
Binner, but Martinez, if you can tell, our brain was like, what the hell is going on,

53:10.840 --> 53:15.200
and we start thinking, are they joking, are they not joking, what the hell is going on,

53:15.200 --> 53:17.760
and they say bad words, like, way worse.

53:17.760 --> 53:21.200
This behaviour routinely involved waking them up unannounced, something that the Martinez

53:21.200 --> 53:24.860
twins felt they were subjected to far more than any other member in the house, how they

53:24.860 --> 53:28.220
also revealed that they were made to do some pretty uncomfortable actions under the guise

53:28.220 --> 53:32.480
of content which they didn't really understand, and felt under pressure due to the overbearing

53:32.480 --> 53:34.860
environment that Jake Paul had manifested.

53:34.860 --> 53:38.640
This was particularly concerning when Jake tried to make the Martinez twins perform something

53:38.640 --> 53:42.160
unsavoury on each other, which the Martinez twins documented.

54:08.640 --> 54:27.620
Their treatment didn't appear dissimilar to the extremely controversial, and often

54:27.620 --> 54:31.620
illegal hazing rituals that many frat houses employ on newer members, there's a sense

54:31.620 --> 54:35.420
that the Martinez twins, although struggling to find their feet, wanted to be accepted,

54:35.420 --> 54:38.520
and therefore would tolerate and do a lot more than most people would do in a normal

54:38.520 --> 54:42.640
environment, and Jake was aware of that and used it as leverage to behave pretty terribly

54:42.640 --> 54:45.440
towards them, because he knew they wouldn't say anything back.

54:45.440 --> 54:49.400
Whenever they tried to take countermeasures, like locking the door or finding new accommodation,

54:49.400 --> 54:53.000
Jake would become visibly angered, seemingly worried about the consequences it could incur

54:53.000 --> 54:54.600
on the group's image or content.

54:54.600 --> 55:00.060
But he was so mad when we tried to lock the door, he was like yo yo open open open, yeah

55:00.060 --> 55:06.720
we were like okay, so and then we were like okay let's try to move to another house just

55:06.720 --> 55:11.820
to have our privacy, to take a shower, Jake found out that he was, that we were getting

55:11.820 --> 55:16.700
an apartment or something like that, because someone told him, so we had the meeting, Jake

55:16.700 --> 55:22.720
was really mad to us, he was like yelling at us because we wanted to move, that he only

55:22.720 --> 55:28.400
cared about the paparazzi that were outside, like if we move, they're gonna say all the

55:28.400 --> 55:33.260
Martinez twins move out, oh my god Jake Paul, he didn't care about our privacy, he only

55:33.260 --> 55:38.540
cared about himself, he used his name, himself.

55:38.540 --> 55:42.780
He also supposedly refused them an English tutor, likely concerned they may dare to feel

55:42.780 --> 55:43.780
empowered.

55:43.780 --> 55:46.860
In spite of all this, they chose to remain and try their best, but the cracks were obviously

55:46.860 --> 55:50.560
beginning to show, and this ultimately bored over when they realised that in spite of all

55:50.560 --> 55:54.600
the bullshit they were subjected to, Team 10 were hoarding all the profits for themselves,

55:54.600 --> 55:57.460
and lying to the Martinez twins about how they could transfer it.

55:57.460 --> 56:04.320
I asked them about a bank account in LA, and they're like you guys don't have visas,

56:04.320 --> 56:09.160
so you guys can- and then I found out now you can have a bank account in LA without

56:09.160 --> 56:15.720
any permission, when you make your own money, and they took everything, they were holding

56:15.720 --> 56:21.120
more than a Lambo, and that's the reason, like I could send that money, and I'm gonna

56:21.120 --> 56:26.560
try to get it, but I could send that money back to Spain, and have it with my family,

56:26.560 --> 56:30.200
and all the stuff that they wanna do, and that's the reason that it pissed me off.

56:30.200 --> 56:33.800
They finish the video with a request, that when Jake Paul inevitably finds more members

56:33.800 --> 56:37.640
for the Team 10 house, he should treat them better than he treated the Martinez twins,

56:37.640 --> 56:41.280
or else he'll be stuck in a cycle doomed to repeat itself, one that would inevitably

56:41.280 --> 56:42.960
leave him worse for wear.

56:42.960 --> 56:48.240
You're gonna have more members on Team 10, okay? I want you to treat them right, I want

56:48.240 --> 56:55.120
you to treat them not like us, because if you treat them like us, you're gonna be

56:55.120 --> 56:58.240
alone always, and I don't want you to be alone.

56:58.240 --> 57:02.760
The Martinez Twins video was a fiery departure from Team 10, and added them to the growing

57:02.760 --> 57:06.480
roster of members who had left on unfavourable terms with the squad's ringleader.

57:06.480 --> 57:10.720
By this point, you could create a whole new Team 10 with people no longer in Team 10,

57:10.720 --> 57:14.620
and like clockwork, many jumped on this to know what it said about the once more under

57:14.620 --> 57:15.620
fire ensemble.

57:15.620 --> 57:20.200
You just have to look at Team 10's history to know, this is a recurring theme.

57:20.200 --> 57:22.400
But what did it say about Jake?

57:22.400 --> 57:35.640
When you react to this, you're not gonna say anything on your social media, because

57:35.640 --> 57:40.720
you know, we're right, we're right, we're saying the truth, and when you say the truth,

57:40.720 --> 57:44.000
you don't have words to say something.

57:44.000 --> 57:47.800
In their video, the Martinez Twins hypothesised that Jake would decline to comment on their

57:47.800 --> 57:51.960
video because he knew it to be true, however, they would be surprised as barely a couple

57:51.960 --> 57:55.240
days after, Jake would upload a video response to Twitter.

57:55.240 --> 58:02.240
What's up everybody, I wanna address the Martinez Twins situation, and let me start

58:02.240 --> 58:09.640
off by saying, first of all, I'm so sorry to the Martinez Twins, nobody should ever

58:09.640 --> 58:16.040
feel bullied, and I truly apologise for not doing a better job as a leader and as a friend,

58:16.040 --> 58:18.800
pure and simple, I owe you guys an apology.

58:18.800 --> 58:22.720
In this video, Jake elaborates on his feelings, and explains Team 10's previous response

58:22.720 --> 58:26.760
as one that was a result of offence and upset that anyone could interpret his actions in

58:26.760 --> 58:27.760
such a way.

58:27.760 --> 58:31.440
It was bizarre that Team 10 attempted to respond before the Martinez Twins had uploaded a follow

58:31.440 --> 58:36.480
up video and their evidence, it made Jake's walking back rather awkward, but he continued.

58:36.480 --> 58:41.320
Jake says, I'm happy they took the time to share their feelings in the second video,

58:41.320 --> 58:50.440
which makes things clear, but they never came to me or anyone and shared how they were feeling,

58:50.440 --> 58:53.880
which would have resolved the situation immediately.

58:53.880 --> 58:57.720
He states that the Martinez Twins had never come to him directly and expressed these concerns,

58:57.720 --> 59:01.200
and that if they had, they would have been resolved immediately, although not presenting

59:01.200 --> 59:05.000
this as a direct counter to what the Martinez Twins were saying, it does contradict their

59:05.000 --> 59:15.440
account pretty significantly, in their video the Martinez Twins openly state that they

59:15.440 --> 59:19.360
added a lock to the door and expressed intent to move house, both of which Jake didn't

59:19.360 --> 59:20.360
seem to appreciate.

59:20.360 --> 59:24.400
I know they're not overt expressions of discomfort necessarily, but if Jake is anything

59:24.400 --> 59:28.000
like we've understood him to be thus far, he's certainly a man who can read some text,

59:28.000 --> 59:31.160
and if you're playing pranks on someone, and then they just happen to ask if they can

59:31.160 --> 59:35.520
move out, there's probably a reason for it, so Jake here is either denying that this request

59:35.520 --> 59:39.880
was made, or implying that he could not draw a parallel between the two situations, something

59:39.880 --> 59:43.800
that a lot of people found implausible, not least the Martinez Twins themselves, who found

59:43.800 --> 59:47.300
this sudden change of tone quite surprising considering that he and the rest of the team

59:47.300 --> 59:50.000
had flatly denied all claims at first.

59:50.000 --> 59:55.200
We had a conversation so many times, I knew that we were feeling that way, that we were

59:55.200 --> 59:56.200
feeling bad.

59:56.200 --> 59:59.260
Additionally, they didn't appreciate the fact that he still declined to comment on

59:59.260 --> 01:00:03.240
any of their other claims, including the racism, and the withholding of funds which they felt

01:00:03.240 --> 01:00:04.240
entitled to.

01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:10.440
It means that you hold our money, and you only apologise about the pranks, you said

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:18.080
racist things to us, and one thing, you hold my money, you hold my mom's money, I don't

01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:25.280
even care if it's my money, I care if I can give the money to my mom.

01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:28.640
Beyond that, though, they seemed insulted by the fact that before they'd even released

01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:32.520
their second video, Team 10 had rushed to brand them as liars, including Jake's own

01:00:32.520 --> 01:00:36.200
father, Greg Paul, who believed this move was orchestrated by their manager.

01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:43.800
That Jake brought those guys to a whole other level, and they would not be anywhere near

01:00:43.800 --> 01:00:50.400
where they are without Jake, without Team 10, and without the love and support that

01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:51.760
they gave those guys.

01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:55.920
In this case, it was a conflict of words, but the truth was that most evidence was readily

01:00:55.920 --> 01:00:59.560
available on Jake Paul and Team 10's channel, which may have turned into a compilation that

01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:01.520
for viewers, spoke for themselves.

01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:10.960
Jake, you apologise, because you were so many times bullying us on camera, and even worse

01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:15.920
off camera, and you said in your video that the problem was our English, and that's

01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:21.000
why we felt more bullied, so we posted a video saying the truth, that all the things that

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.760
you did to us, that's bullying in any language.

01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:27.640
This was not the first time that Jake had been accused of emotional abuse, and there

01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:29.360
were definitely similarities in the cases.

01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:32.960
Both Alyssa Violet and the Martinez Twins had been invited out to LA with the promise

01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:37.000
of success, views, and support from Jake Paul, and in both scenarios, they found themselves

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:40.760
merely as cannon fodder for that content, outside of which they were often isolated

01:01:40.760 --> 01:01:43.420
to keep them primed for future Team 10 uploads.

01:01:43.420 --> 01:01:46.400
In the case of the Martinez Twins, however, it definitely seemed more sinister, given

01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:49.320
that their isolation didn't just come from the fact that they were in a place they weren't

01:01:49.320 --> 01:01:52.760
familiar with, but they were actively disadvantaged in how they could interact with others.

01:01:52.760 --> 01:01:56.480
One of the most concerning details was the fact that Jake and others allegedly refused

01:01:56.480 --> 01:01:59.680
them an English teacher, although I cannot look into Jake's mind and tell you the exact

01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:03.400
reason that he might have done this, for many it almost seemed self-explanatory.

01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:06.280
If they learned English, then they would wise up to the context of what he was doing and

01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:08.600
probably undermine his plans for content creation.

01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:12.520
At its heart, Team 10 was a well-oiled machine, and there were obviously people who were aware

01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:15.160
of its integral nature, nobody more than Jake himself.

01:02:15.160 --> 01:02:19.160
There was no way a lot of content like that would just happen naturally, however, if everyone

01:02:19.160 --> 01:02:22.280
was in on it, then its contrivances would likely become quite obvious.

01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:26.000
There were theories that Team 10 was fake in the sense that everyone knew exactly what

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:29.260
was going on, but these videos tended to tell a different story.

01:02:29.260 --> 01:02:32.920
That story was that Jake enjoyed people who were not entirely in on the joke, he enjoyed

01:02:32.920 --> 01:02:36.240
people who were somewhat innocent and naive, not only because fans found those sorts of

01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:39.920
characters endearing, but he also likely knew that their desire for acceptance amongst a

01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:44.120
popular social group would drive them to be more enthusiastic and involved in the antics

01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:48.160
they may not have fully understood, and tolerate more Team 10 bullshit which would allow Jake

01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:49.640
to push the content further.

01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:53.120
It's by the allegations of Jake holding people back though, I don't doubt he knew

01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:57.080
that eventually they would acclimatise to his shenanigans, however, in his head he believed

01:02:57.080 --> 01:03:00.480
the growth and success that he offered would serve as a fair trade for being subjected

01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:01.480
to the pranks he pulled.

01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:05.800
That was one continuous miscalculation that he made, although hazing is pretty awful for

01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:10.600
a lot of people, it does result in the induction of an individual into a group or organisation,

01:03:10.600 --> 01:03:13.720
with some of him viewing that reward as completely worthwhile.

01:03:13.720 --> 01:03:17.480
Yet Jake appeared to conflate statistical reward with emotional reward, maybe because

01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:21.520
of his own perspective on the matter, maybe in his mind somewhere he believed the Martinez

01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:25.400
Twins should just be grateful for what he did to them, he gave them clout and attention,

01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:28.880
pranks were just part of the deal you make for being in that house, however, he fundamentally

01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:32.920
misunderstood how people would interact with that behaviour, the fact that many also want

01:03:32.920 --> 01:03:36.920
emotional validation for such actions, something that the Martinez Twins emphasised.

01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:42.520
Prank someone, you can prank someone and then say, sorry, I'm so sorry, I'm gonna clean

01:03:42.520 --> 01:03:46.560
it up, sorry, you can prank me back, like I pranked my brother in my blocks, and you

01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:52.040
can see, I pranked my brother, and we pranked back, so it's fine, but like, I will say sorry,

01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:58.800
I will say, if I messed up, or if I, so if I messed up, I'm gonna clean it, like, don't

01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:04.760
worry, I'm gonna do it, like, I'm sorry, but he didn't, he punched me in my face, in a

01:04:04.760 --> 01:04:11.160
prank, but like, how you feel when you wake up, you wake up, and you have someone, someone

01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:15.500
next to you just ready to do something, I don't want this in my life.

01:04:15.500 --> 01:04:19.200
He never offered that reward to people who tolerated his bullshit, he never gave them

01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:23.160
that induction, he kept that admission into his inner circle at arm's length of many of

01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:27.680
those he tormented, and for the Martinez Twins, that became too much of an ordeal to manage,

01:04:27.680 --> 01:04:31.360
the psychological damage was palpable, these people not really knowing where they stood

01:04:31.360 --> 01:04:34.980
with their supposed leader, being scared of going to sleep every night, what Jake was

01:04:34.980 --> 01:04:40.080
doing had a marked negative effect, and what was it for? Well, to maintain a dynamic that

01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:43.720
he was happy with, however in doing so he raised serious ethical questions that many

01:04:43.720 --> 01:04:47.520
would justifiably take issue with. Jake's response was that he assumed that this was

01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:51.240
all a septal banter between people who would be considered friends, but the problem was

01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:54.740
that to them they weren't friends, they were just fuel, and that was illustrated by their

01:04:54.740 --> 01:04:58.920
perception of Jake Paul on and off camera, and the social engineering that was manufactured

01:04:58.920 --> 01:05:02.440
by Jake Paul himself. Was this cycle doomed to repeat itself?

01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:11.480
Over the next couple of months, this whole situation was addressed a few times by separate

01:05:11.480 --> 01:05:14.840
people, probably the most interesting example of this was Nick Crompton, who was able to

01:05:14.840 --> 01:05:17.040
handle himself pretty professionally on camera.

01:05:17.040 --> 01:05:22.120
Nick Crompton- One minute everything was fine, and the next it wasn't, and I don't think

01:05:22.120 --> 01:05:24.840
I'm ever going to know the reason behind that.

01:05:24.840 --> 01:05:28.480
He repeated the same message that Jake did, that ultimately he wasn't sure where this

01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:32.120
information was coming from, and once again, although not directly accusing the Martinez

01:05:32.120 --> 01:05:35.480
twins of lying, still contradicting their claims that this was a serious problem in

01:05:35.480 --> 01:05:36.480
their minds.

01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:40.560
Nick Crompton- I, along with everyone else, when it happened, and even before it was happening,

01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:45.800
I've been messaging them, and trying to figure out what's wrong, what's going on, and there's

01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:46.800
just been no response.

01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:50.520
When someone conveys themselves well, it's very easy to look at the situation and go,

01:05:50.520 --> 01:05:55.200
well, maybe this was one big misunderstanding, even in spite of the compelling evidence presented.

01:05:55.240 --> 01:05:58.840
Nonetheless, even if it was, there's still a reason why they felt they had to leave,

01:05:58.840 --> 01:06:02.400
there must have been a reason why they thought the grass was greener, there had to be a reason

01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:03.400
this kept happening.

01:06:03.400 --> 01:06:06.360
What was going on, and what could be done about it?

01:06:06.360 --> 01:06:07.360
Let's have a little flashback.

01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:11.960
Jake- And good morning, Jake Paulers, I hope you guys are having a great day, we're gonna

01:06:11.960 --> 01:06:16.320
kill it, make sure you're smiling, make sure you're dabbing on them haters, make sure you're

01:06:16.320 --> 01:06:21.240
working hard, baby, and if you're new here, I'm Jake Paul, these are the Jake Paulers,

01:06:21.240 --> 01:06:24.240
and it is lit every single day, bruh.

01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:28.240
When the team burst onto the scene in May 2017, everyone was against him, they had something

01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:32.400
to work towards, a goal of sorts, to cement their reputation in spite of their detractors,

01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:36.000
there was this energy pulling the group together, this idea that there was a struggle, walking

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:39.500
away from a group at any point around them would have made you a traitor, especially

01:06:39.500 --> 01:06:41.680
during the Alyssa Violet and FaZe Banks era.

01:06:41.680 --> 01:06:45.120
At the same time, there was this sense of commitment and loyalty, people had been offered

01:06:45.120 --> 01:06:48.800
a space and a luxurious house, they had been promised fame and followers, and that's what

01:06:48.800 --> 01:06:50.360
they wanted to work towards.

01:06:50.360 --> 01:06:53.760
Jake put himself out there, made himself the villain of the internet to spread their message

01:06:53.800 --> 01:06:58.040
worldwide, and it worked extremely effectively at the time, at the start their growth would

01:06:58.040 --> 01:07:02.220
have been rewarded in itself, but as the months passed, and the growth stagnated a little,

01:07:02.220 --> 01:07:05.700
there was this lingering question of where Team 10 could even go from the dramatic heights

01:07:05.700 --> 01:07:10.280
they descended throughout the mid-year, earlier I spoke about how Jake conceptualised Team

01:07:10.280 --> 01:07:13.920
10 from a more professional perspective, and how that was somewhat abandoned as he became

01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:18.280
more notorious as a celebrity himself, however it also began to desert what ultimately kept

01:07:18.280 --> 01:07:21.120
Team 10 together, that notion of progression.

01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:25.240
Alyssa Violet's departure was strictly personal, whereas the Martinez twins felt

01:07:25.240 --> 01:07:29.080
more like a mesh between personal and professional, they had experienced all these pranks that

01:07:29.080 --> 01:07:33.000
caused significant psychological upset, and practically received nothing in return, and

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:36.760
as the team's online reputation fell into the minds of disinterest amongst many online

01:07:36.760 --> 01:07:41.180
viewers, that dissatisfaction over diminishing dividends was likely exacerbated, this was

01:07:41.180 --> 01:07:45.360
fundamentally because Jake Paul had shifted the window of what he sought to achieve himself,

01:07:45.360 --> 01:07:47.040
and tried to take Team 10 with it.

01:07:47.040 --> 01:07:49.680
Jake Paul's

01:07:49.680 --> 01:07:58.200
Initially, Team 10 was presented as a social incubator for talent, Jake Paul marketed it

01:07:58.200 --> 01:08:01.600
as that, that he would be at the helm of the creative side, but would also be managing

01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:05.600
these individuals as well, and making sure their full potential was realised, particularly

01:08:05.600 --> 01:08:09.520
with the application of his business, Teamdom. The problem is that when someone feels they've

01:08:09.520 --> 01:08:13.160
reached their full potential within the team, there is that question of what now? What was

01:08:13.160 --> 01:08:16.880
Jake going to offer them now they've felt more confident in themselves? Jake seemed

01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:20.480
to want to take up the Royal Talent Manager, the promoter, but because he had become so

01:08:20.480 --> 01:08:24.260
heavily involved as a public figure, and one desperate to enshrine his status as the bad

01:08:24.260 --> 01:08:28.640
boy of YouTube, his desire to be taken seriously as a businessman began to flounder, and this

01:08:28.640 --> 01:08:33.240
idea of an infinite career progression inside Team 10 began to appear less and less available

01:08:33.240 --> 01:08:37.680
to its members. Furthermore, the fame that Team 10 had generated its members, likely

01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:41.520
more than any had ever envisioned, allowed them to establish themselves as individual

01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:45.500
creators. No longer was the clout and the luxurious house a valid form of compensation

01:08:45.500 --> 01:08:49.320
for one's troubles, as you become more defined as individual creators, as you find yourself

01:08:49.320 --> 01:08:53.360
with more dedicated fans, you find yourself realising that you can bargain more. And when

01:08:53.360 --> 01:08:56.840
people tried to do that, it seemed that this was just not really an option to Jake, who

01:08:56.840 --> 01:09:00.880
still wanted that collective under very tight management. So what Jake was really conjuring

01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:04.880
was a revolving door system of talent management, where people would join, grow their channel,

01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:08.440
and then realise that there wasn't much else that Jake or Team 10 could offer them, and

01:09:08.440 --> 01:09:11.800
walk away. Further to this, the trend of posting departure videos on the collective

01:09:11.800 --> 01:09:15.380
made leaving the group a more notable thing, and likely made some people feel more empowered

01:09:15.380 --> 01:09:19.440
to do so. Although possibly risking status as a traitor, Team 10's image had become

01:09:19.440 --> 01:09:22.840
so toxic that for every person who might call you a snake, there were 10 more willing to

01:09:22.840 --> 01:09:26.920
back you. In trying to make Team 10 bigger than anything else, Jake had unintentionally

01:09:26.920 --> 01:09:30.820
created a leaving culture, and had done nothing to actually counteract it. It seemed that

01:09:30.820 --> 01:09:35.280
Team 10 was on the brink, and this truth would only be proven further as the new year approached.

01:09:35.640 --> 01:09:39.520
By Christmas 2017, although Jake had lost some pretty significant names, the core membership

01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:43.760
of Team 10 were still intact, but every passing day that appeared more shaky, especially given

01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:47.960
Alex Lang's choir departure at the start of December, and at the turn of 2018, they

01:09:47.960 --> 01:09:52.080
lost two more members, Tristan, an American vlogger, and Tessa Brooks, another person

01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:54.640
who had a verse in the notorious It's Everyday Bro.

01:09:54.640 --> 01:09:58.560
Tessa Brooks- It's just that we've grown apart, and we're heading in different directions,

01:09:58.560 --> 01:10:03.840
and that's totally okay, it's not something that is right for me anymore, and we just

01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:08.720
disagree on a lot of things, and that's okay, everyone has their disagreements, I don't

01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:12.400
regret being a part of Team 10, I don't take it back, I wish everyone had Team 10 the best,

01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:15.520
but it's just not for me anymore.

01:10:15.520 --> 01:10:18.960
Both of them appeared to not harbour animosity towards the team, but the message was clear,

01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:22.480
that what was being offered to them was not anything that they felt they needed anymore,

01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:25.920
and additionally, the fact that they probably did not move into the new place had cemented

01:10:25.920 --> 01:10:27.760
this idea that their paths were diverging.

01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:32.040
Alex- We had our differences, but most of all, my goals are just going in a different

01:10:32.040 --> 01:10:33.160
direction than Team 10.

01:10:33.160 --> 01:10:36.520
This year, I want to be working towards the goals that I set for myself when I first started

01:10:36.520 --> 01:10:37.240
social media.

01:10:37.240 --> 01:10:40.760
In many ways, these departures were more cutting to Team 10's image, although the

01:10:40.760 --> 01:10:44.360
modernized twins allegations concern more serious breaches of behaviour, it gave them

01:10:44.360 --> 01:10:48.920
something to respond to, this was just two people stating that Team 10 was not offering

01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:49.960
them what they needed.

01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:53.720
And if Team 10 couldn't offer two young and capable individuals a route to advance

01:10:53.720 --> 01:10:55.720
their career, what could they offer?

01:10:56.280 --> 01:10:58.120
Where could Team 10 go from here?

01:11:02.040 --> 01:11:13.480
January 2018 was a rather uneventful month for Team 10, Jake tried to push viewership

01:11:13.480 --> 01:11:17.880
with the typical on-brand hijinks, and uploaded videos that I'd call landmark content, where

01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:20.360
Jake announces something huge that has happened in his life.

01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:23.400
Unfortunately, he'd been through so many breakups and relationships at this point that

01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:27.160
he was scraping the bottom of the barrel, which produced gems such as the now-deleted

01:11:27.160 --> 01:11:31.720
I Lost My Virginity, which one can only hypothesize about the cause of the deletion of such

01:11:31.720 --> 01:11:32.920
precious content.

01:11:32.920 --> 01:11:36.680
In spite of all his attempts to provoke the internet, nobody was really biting that hard,

01:11:36.680 --> 01:11:40.120
and you could put it down to inertia, but there was another reason too.

01:11:40.120 --> 01:11:44.600
Now I can't talk about this too much because YouTube won't be very happy, at the start

01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:49.880
of January there was an instant where Redacted Redacted went into a known Redacted Redacted

01:11:49.880 --> 01:11:53.720
where people Redacted Redacted, and Redacted Redacted Redacted.

01:11:53.720 --> 01:11:58.120
This mystery individual was related to Jake Paul, and apparently people's attention spans

01:11:58.120 --> 01:12:01.000
could only sustain themselves on one Paul at a time.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:04.280
And now that this had occurred, everyone's attention was elsewhere, and there was no

01:12:04.280 --> 01:12:08.520
amount of clickbait that could supersede the outrage that Jake Paul's relative generated.

01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:12.600
After the loss of Tessa and Tristan, Team 10 were looking noticeably leaner on the line

01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:16.360
up front, and barely a couple days after the incident with Jake Paul's relative, and Tristan

01:12:16.360 --> 01:12:20.680
Tessa's departure from the channel, Jake launched a new plan, something called Edfluence.

01:12:20.680 --> 01:12:25.960
Edfluence is a course that you guys can take right now, online, how to do social media,

01:12:25.960 --> 01:12:31.720
secrets, tips, tricks, how to be a YouTuber, how to grow your channel, all things that

01:12:31.720 --> 01:12:36.840
have taken me years to master, you could even potentially be able to join Team 10 if you

01:12:36.840 --> 01:12:38.040
take this course.

01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:42.520
This was a campaign designed to create what he branded as his Team 1000, possibly of future

01:12:42.520 --> 01:12:46.120
influencers who would be able to use the tricks that Jake Paul had used to have their own

01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:46.920
shot at stardom.

01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:50.200
This appeared to be Jake Paul's solution to losing some of his business credibility

01:12:50.760 --> 01:12:54.920
on social media, and was met with anticipation by a lot of his followers, and even some aspiring

01:12:54.920 --> 01:12:56.040
influencers.

01:12:56.040 --> 01:12:59.560
How nearly immediately after the launch, the site was mired with technical issues and pricing

01:12:59.560 --> 01:13:02.040
complaints, leading many to brand it a complete scam.

01:13:02.040 --> 01:13:05.560
There was no denying its slapdash release, especially given that a community section

01:13:05.560 --> 01:13:09.160
that Jake Paul vocally advertises in these videos didn't actually exist.

01:13:09.160 --> 01:13:12.120
For all the time Edfluence had been in the works, the Twitter account had been active

01:13:12.120 --> 01:13:15.080
since mid-2017, this seemed surprisingly rushed.

01:13:15.080 --> 01:13:18.280
Was Jake aware that Team 10 was struggling, and this was a quick cash-in?

01:13:18.280 --> 01:13:22.520
Was he trying to use it as a proxy recruitment site, or was he just trying to take advantage

01:13:22.520 --> 01:13:24.040
of his relative's misdeeds?

01:13:24.040 --> 01:13:28.040
One can only guess, but it felt like Team 10's membership was becoming increasingly

01:13:28.040 --> 01:13:32.600
unstable, and on the 2nd of February, Jake decided to finally address it once and for

01:13:32.600 --> 01:13:32.920
all.

01:13:32.920 --> 01:13:36.760
Jake Paul- And like this video isn't meant to stir up drama, however, like, I never talk

01:13:36.760 --> 01:13:41.640
about drama, and I never like snap back to any like haters or whatever, but I feel like

01:13:41.640 --> 01:13:43.160
this is good to get off our chest.

01:13:43.160 --> 01:13:47.160
As per usual, it's at the end of the video, but still somewhat significant as Jake had

01:13:47.160 --> 01:13:50.600
often avoided even acknowledging people who had left the crew on his main channel.

01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:55.640
He expresses his desire to clear the air and tell the truth, two phrases heavily associated

01:13:55.640 --> 01:13:56.440
with him.

01:13:56.440 --> 01:13:57.400
What was that truth?

01:13:57.400 --> 01:14:02.440
Well that, surprise suckers, this was actually what he had intended all along.

01:14:02.440 --> 01:14:06.680
Jake- But the point is, is that it is an incubator, and if you guys don't know what an incubator

01:14:06.680 --> 01:14:07.800
is, think of a duck egg.

01:14:07.800 --> 01:14:13.000
A duck egg gets put into an incubator, it gets warmed up, a couple months later it hatches,

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.480
and then the duck goes off on its own and lives its duck life.

01:14:15.480 --> 01:14:20.120
Jake opens by talking about the incubator theory, and comparing it to ducklings hatching

01:14:20.120 --> 01:14:20.760
from an egg.

01:14:20.760 --> 01:14:24.440
When they hatch from an egg, they venture off into the world, and are no longer kept

01:14:24.440 --> 01:14:26.280
within that Team 10 incubator.

01:14:26.280 --> 01:14:30.280
Javi then goes on to say that these ducklings do not just go out into the world, in fact,

01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:35.800
they are kicked out by the Team 10 High Council, who evaluate which members are worthy of staying,

01:14:35.800 --> 01:14:37.160
and which members are not.

01:14:37.160 --> 01:14:41.080
Jake even gets statistical, estimating that approximately three quarters of members who

01:14:41.080 --> 01:14:44.200
had left the Team 10 house, and made videos on the matter claiming that they had left

01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:47.560
by their own volition, were actually jumping before they were pushed.

01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:52.760
The truth is, Team 10 is a family, and a lot of the times, the family makes a decision

01:14:52.760 --> 01:14:58.440
as a pact on who is going to be in the team, and who isn't going to be in the team.

01:14:59.240 --> 01:15:03.800
But the majority of the time, it's the internal members making a decision to tell another

01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:07.880
member that like, hey, we don't think this is right, and we should go our separate ways,

01:15:07.880 --> 01:15:09.480
that we let them do whatever they want.

01:15:09.480 --> 01:15:15.160
They make videos saying that they're leaving Team 10, when I just am putting this out there

01:15:15.160 --> 01:15:18.360
into the air, that 75% of the time, that is not the truth.

01:15:18.360 --> 01:15:22.120
Jake will have you know he is very happy with the departures, and thinks that their videos

01:15:22.120 --> 01:15:26.280
serve Team 10 excellent publicity, while also allowing him to focus more closely on the

01:15:26.280 --> 01:15:27.640
people that he can trust.

01:15:27.640 --> 01:15:31.400
Even if the circle had become a bit smaller, from Jake's perspective, it had only grown

01:15:31.400 --> 01:15:36.040
stronger, and for him, this just represented a new beginning, something that he branded

01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:37.000
Phase 2.

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:41.240
I think this is just the start for Team 10 as an empire, and I call this Phase 2.

01:15:41.240 --> 01:15:45.160
As you can see, although numerous members had upped and left, some under extremely hostile

01:15:45.160 --> 01:15:49.640
terms, everything was going according to plan, and Jake was merely separating the wheat from

01:15:49.640 --> 01:15:50.280
the chaff.

01:15:50.280 --> 01:15:53.800
Smash that subscribe button, join the strongest team on YouTube, and I will see y'all tomorrow

01:15:53.800 --> 01:15:55.480
because it's everyday bro.

01:15:55.480 --> 01:16:00.520
Jake has this incredible talent of taking an L, and presenting it as a W to his followers.

01:16:00.520 --> 01:16:04.440
Some likely left this video feeling like they had a better understanding of his perspective,

01:16:04.440 --> 01:16:08.600
but the truth was that even if the incubator system worked as Jake intended it to, it meant

01:16:08.600 --> 01:16:12.920
that Team 10 had to constantly find exemplary talent, or else they would not be able to

01:16:12.920 --> 01:16:15.000
create a long-term connection with audience members.

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:19.240
Jake was notably fragile about the image that members leaving would project onto Team 10,

01:16:19.240 --> 01:16:22.200
and how that may affect their own prospects for recruiting other people.

01:16:22.200 --> 01:16:26.360
Not all publicity is good publicity when it makes your space look like an unattractive

01:16:26.360 --> 01:16:27.560
place to spend time.

01:16:27.560 --> 01:16:31.160
Many members who left cited they thought this would be the place of their dreams, but were

01:16:31.160 --> 01:16:32.520
deeply disappointed.

01:16:32.520 --> 01:16:35.240
That is not going to look enticing to outsiders.

01:16:35.800 --> 01:16:39.400
Additionally, all these fans created connections with certain members who left, and when they

01:16:39.400 --> 01:16:44.120
left they had to deal with the emotional disappointment, and decide whether they could really invest

01:16:44.120 --> 01:16:45.000
themselves again.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:48.680
There was no way that system could work effectively on a long-term basis.

01:16:48.680 --> 01:16:52.840
Jake presents these members leaving as just him trial and error testing people until he

01:16:52.840 --> 01:16:56.520
finds the right ones, and that this was actually the start of a new era with better members

01:16:56.520 --> 01:17:00.840
than ever, but how many of these new members at this point had actually stuck around?

01:17:00.840 --> 01:17:03.080
What could Phase 2 even consist of?

01:17:08.520 --> 01:17:12.200
So that's the reason why you guys see some of these videos online, that's the reason

01:17:12.200 --> 01:17:17.080
why people make those videos, and that's the reason why Team 10 sometimes gets smaller

01:17:17.080 --> 01:17:21.880
and smaller and smaller, but internally we just get happier, happier, closer and closer

01:17:21.880 --> 01:17:23.720
and closer, and stronger and stronger.

01:17:23.720 --> 01:17:27.080
We can look over the first year of Team 10 and talk about what worked and what didn't,

01:17:27.160 --> 01:17:31.640
but Jake did make one good point, that ultimately he had a few core members who were identifiable

01:17:31.640 --> 01:17:35.160
to many online audiences, and had a strong connection with that audience.

01:17:35.160 --> 01:17:38.680
Jake Paul's argument was shaky, but ultimately could be perceived as valid in the way that

01:17:38.680 --> 01:17:42.680
a lot of the people who were long-term members appeared to be actually part of Jake's inner

01:17:42.680 --> 01:17:45.800
circle, and very few within the inner circle had ever left.

01:17:45.800 --> 01:17:50.840
I'd say this inner circle consisted primarily of Erika Costell, Johnson Anthony, Chad Tepper,

01:17:50.840 --> 01:17:51.800
and Nick Crompton.

01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:55.080
Us in the group still held influence, but these were the ones who seemed to draw the

01:17:55.080 --> 01:17:57.080
most collective presence for the team online.

01:17:57.080 --> 01:18:00.520
They were the ones who would probably spring to mind when you mentioned those who were

01:18:00.520 --> 01:18:01.720
actually part of the posse.

01:18:01.720 --> 01:18:05.320
In early formats of the group, the Team 10 page was often split between the squad and

01:18:05.320 --> 01:18:09.880
the team, the team often concerning themselves with the logistical side of operations, which

01:18:09.880 --> 01:18:11.880
inevitably brought them closer to Jake.

01:18:11.880 --> 01:18:25.800
Uh, I'm sorry, um, I don't know, like, how to say this, um, but it's been, like, I just,

01:18:25.800 --> 01:18:28.040
like, wanted to call everyone here.

01:18:28.040 --> 01:18:39.160
Sorry, uh, this whole Team 10 thing has been such an incredible journey, a year and a half

01:18:39.240 --> 01:18:43.400
or so of, you know, family.

01:18:43.400 --> 01:18:47.880
They had been there since 2017 at the latest, who had often been alongside Jake during many

01:18:47.880 --> 01:18:48.920
of his controversies.

01:18:48.920 --> 01:18:52.840
They signified a loyalty to the team that many fans would identify with.

01:18:52.840 --> 01:18:56.360
These individuals also seemed more involved in Jake's business side, and they didn't

01:18:56.360 --> 01:18:58.200
necessarily make a great secret of it.

01:18:58.200 --> 01:19:01.640
With this in mind, they probably received a more personal side of Jake Paul that certain

01:19:01.640 --> 01:19:05.800
creators who had felt bruised by his behaviour didn't, and felt like they knew him better

01:19:05.800 --> 01:19:09.240
and could take his behaviour in a context that helped him understand it.

01:19:09.240 --> 01:19:12.680
With that said, there were definitely aspects of the business partners in Team 10 that made

01:19:12.680 --> 01:19:14.040
them extremely influential.

01:19:14.040 --> 01:19:18.040
They likely knew their worth to the audience, and they knew their image was something that

01:19:18.040 --> 01:19:19.720
couldn't necessarily be replaced.

01:19:19.720 --> 01:19:23.400
With that in mind, they were still essential to Team 10's second phase, and none of them

01:19:23.400 --> 01:19:25.480
seemed to be going anywhere, at first.

01:19:26.040 --> 01:19:30.120
Team 10's monthly viewership statistics have been on a downward trend since 2017.

01:19:30.120 --> 01:19:34.200
At their peak, they were averaging around 15 or 16 million views per day, and although

01:19:34.200 --> 01:19:38.120
most people wouldn't turn down the viewership they were pulling at the start of 2018, it

01:19:38.120 --> 01:19:42.440
would regularly dip to 3 or 4 million, less than a quarter of their most successful months.

01:19:42.440 --> 01:19:46.360
Particularly for an incubator, people liked the idea that they can take enterprise from

01:19:46.360 --> 01:19:50.200
strength to strength, and there was this sense that maybe there were not many places for

01:19:50.200 --> 01:19:53.160
Team 10 to go after the frenzy of 2017.

01:19:53.160 --> 01:19:57.480
Although Jake had promised a new era, the months in early 2018 were surprisingly tame,

01:19:57.480 --> 01:20:01.800
with Jake decidedly going for a more tortured anti-hero image, launching a Team 10 tour,

01:20:01.800 --> 01:20:05.160
and hosting interviews where he reflected on the character that he created.

01:20:05.160 --> 01:20:08.760
Jake- I look at myself as a role model, but like an imperfect role model.

01:20:08.760 --> 01:20:10.280
I'm gonna be real, I'm gonna make mistakes.

01:20:10.280 --> 01:20:14.440
I think that's more realistic for kids to have a role model like that, versus someone

01:20:14.440 --> 01:20:18.760
who just seems perfect from the outside, because these kids in school are going through a lot,

01:20:18.760 --> 01:20:21.800
they're gonna get bullied, they're gonna maybe get a detention.

01:20:21.800 --> 01:20:25.400
They need to be shown how to deal with that, and just always think positively, and to keep

01:20:25.400 --> 01:20:28.360
your head up, and that's what I try to put out there.

01:20:28.360 --> 01:20:32.920
Overall, this image was appealing to some devotees, but rather boring to others.

01:20:32.920 --> 01:20:37.080
Probably the most notable news in early 2018 was that his former landlord sued him, claiming

01:20:37.080 --> 01:20:39.800
excessive damages to the previous property he'd resided in.

01:20:39.800 --> 01:20:43.560
When the news reported on this, many people in the comments seemed rather disinterested

01:20:43.560 --> 01:20:47.160
in the affairs of Jake, some even saying that they'd forgotten about his existence.

01:20:47.160 --> 01:20:51.240
After 2017, it just felt like there was nothing that could be done to change the trajectory

01:20:51.240 --> 01:20:54.920
of the channel, it didn't stop them from trying, including new content, new members,

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:58.680
and even what appeared to be a mass deletion of videos that did briefly spike the channel

01:20:58.680 --> 01:21:01.160
viewership, but ultimately to no avail.

01:21:01.160 --> 01:21:03.640
However, everyone was still in for the long run, right?

01:21:04.440 --> 01:21:10.440
Well, on the 4th of May 2018, Team 10's COO Nick Crompton posted a statement to Twitter,

01:21:10.440 --> 01:21:12.840
entitled, It's time to move on from Team 10.

01:21:12.840 --> 01:21:16.760
He briefly details his reason for leaving, stating that the channel is headed in a direction

01:21:16.760 --> 01:21:19.880
that doesn't make sense to him, chalking it up to internal differences.

01:21:19.880 --> 01:21:23.480
He openly expresses his affection for the team and Jake Paul, and states that this has

01:21:23.480 --> 01:21:26.600
been part of his dream, and that he's extremely grateful for the opportunity.

01:21:26.600 --> 01:21:30.520
Overall, it seems quite a nice departure as departures go, but it wouldn't undermine the

01:21:30.520 --> 01:21:34.040
fact that Team 10 just lost one of their most influential figures, and it wasn't going to

01:21:34.040 --> 01:21:36.200
become any easier in the coming days.

01:21:36.200 --> 01:21:41.800
But as time goes on, and you know, things change, people change, like my goals and views

01:21:41.800 --> 01:21:46.440
changed, I've just decided my path is a little bit different from what the team's path is,

01:21:46.440 --> 01:21:50.360
and that was the main reason, that was like my deciding factor in leaving.

01:21:50.920 --> 01:21:55.400
On the 8th of May, Chance Sutton announced his departure in another Twitter post titled,

01:21:55.400 --> 01:21:57.640
Thank you Team 10, love heart.

01:21:57.640 --> 01:22:01.160
Once again, there were a lot of platitudes for Team 10 and Jake, but ultimately Chance

01:22:01.160 --> 01:22:04.840
had decided that he needed to focus on his own career and bid the group adieu.

01:22:04.840 --> 01:22:08.680
As an additional note, the head of engineering also announced his departure on the same day,

01:22:08.680 --> 01:22:12.920
which once more marked a rather strange simultaneous exodus of a few pretty high profile

01:22:12.920 --> 01:22:13.400
members.

01:22:13.400 --> 01:22:17.880
As a matter of fact, every performer other than Jake on It's Everyday Bro had now left.

01:22:17.960 --> 01:22:22.200
Rumours surrounding it would have provoked multiple exits in such a short period of time.

01:22:22.200 --> 01:22:27.000
Something about Phase 2 had clearly rattled a fair few people, but without further information,

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:28.600
one could only speculate.

01:22:28.600 --> 01:22:32.920
Fortunately, we didn't need speculation, and the culprit decided to make himself known,

01:22:32.920 --> 01:22:38.280
and it was none other than Jake's father, Greg Paul, who claimed to have uncovered the truth.

01:22:38.280 --> 01:22:42.760
Yo, what's going on people? GP coming at you.

01:22:42.760 --> 01:22:47.000
According to his subtweet, he had conducted an internal audit, and that he had seemingly

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:51.800
uncovered details of financial recklessness, even implying some form of embezzlement?

01:22:51.800 --> 01:22:55.880
Nick Crompton wasn't happy with this, and angrily tweeted back that it wasn't the audit that people

01:22:55.880 --> 01:22:59.960
had a problem with, it was about that Greg Paul was an all-round extremely unpleasant person to

01:22:59.960 --> 01:23:02.360
deal with, and had next to no communication skills.

01:23:02.360 --> 01:23:07.160
Greg was an interesting person to draft in, maybe because he would fundamentally run perpendicular

01:23:07.160 --> 01:23:09.080
to those of Jake's loyal inner circle.

01:23:09.080 --> 01:23:13.080
His only stakes are his son's wellbeing, and if he felt that people weren't doing their jobs right,

01:23:13.080 --> 01:23:15.720
then he has very little to lose in being cutthroats.

01:23:15.720 --> 01:23:20.840
But Jake Paul did. I don't know Team 10, I don't know if Greg had a point, but regardless of the

01:23:20.840 --> 01:23:25.560
fingers and the pies, he had just fundamentally caused a departure of at least two of the team's

01:23:25.560 --> 01:23:29.960
most influential figures. Regardless of their business practice, they still meant a lot to the

01:23:29.960 --> 01:23:33.960
image of the team, and Nick Crompton's swift smackdown of Greg was probably the most indicative

01:23:33.960 --> 01:23:36.360
of where public sentiment lay on it.

01:23:36.360 --> 01:23:40.840
Greg may be an excellent businessman, but he is not a public figure, and his indirect gusting of

01:23:40.840 --> 01:23:45.320
the team may have been a financially frugal move short term, but it had just jeopardised the future

01:23:45.320 --> 01:23:47.720
of this phase, and one person knew it.

01:23:47.720 --> 01:23:54.520
So, over the past couple of days, I'm sure you guys have seen, there's been members leaving Team 10.

01:23:54.520 --> 01:24:01.960
INTRO

01:24:01.960 --> 01:24:06.360
On the 13th of May, Jake Paul took to YouTube once more to upload a response to the sudden

01:24:06.360 --> 01:24:11.800
departures of individuals, entitled, My Response and the Truth About Members Leaving Team 10.

01:24:11.800 --> 01:24:16.680
As usual, it's placed on the typical vlogging escapades, however, unlike other responses and

01:24:16.680 --> 01:24:20.840
sections, this part takes up two thirds of the video's runtime, and seems to have a rather

01:24:20.840 --> 01:24:24.200
disparate tone to the rest of the content addressing these matters.

01:24:24.200 --> 01:24:31.640
People's goals and things change, and sometimes that change causes people to grow apart from each

01:24:31.640 --> 01:24:39.160
other, and for me, the way that I'm changing is I had bigger vision.

01:24:39.160 --> 01:24:43.080
At a glance, his message doesn't seem particularly different, he goes for the spin that these people

01:24:43.080 --> 01:24:47.080
leaving was actually a favourable outcome, it signified growth and progression for those

01:24:47.080 --> 01:24:51.560
involved, and he personally welcomed that as, to him, change was an inherently positive force.

01:24:51.560 --> 01:24:55.000
His explanation on the departure of certain members appears to align with that of Nick

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:58.520
Crompton, that ultimately the trajectory of the team had been adjusted, and some members

01:24:58.520 --> 01:25:02.520
felt like they didn't identify with those goals anymore. To him that was an acceptable discord,

01:25:02.520 --> 01:25:07.480
but it was also irreconcilable in his mind, so the only option was to go their separate ways.

01:25:07.480 --> 01:25:11.880
As the video, it once again plays into this idea that Jake Paul has all this planned out and under

01:25:11.880 --> 01:25:16.360
control, his vision has become greater than that of those around him, and he is satisfied with the

01:25:16.360 --> 01:25:21.400
outcome, even if he is sad to lose the company of some old friends. Jake Paul-"All of my energy

01:25:22.440 --> 01:25:28.840
is focused on changing right now, and building the new, and going in a new direction, and

01:25:28.840 --> 01:25:34.600
innovating, and being on top of the game." Nevertheless, this video was distinctly different

01:25:34.680 --> 01:25:38.360
to other content that tackled disputes between the team and other creators. First of all,

01:25:38.360 --> 01:25:42.440
gone were those who often flanked Jake, providing that sort of strength and reinforcement to what

01:25:42.440 --> 01:25:46.280
he was saying. Second, gone were the cuts and edits that allowed Jake to make his narrative

01:25:46.280 --> 01:25:49.720
as short and efficient as possible. However, most telling was the fact that although Jake

01:25:49.720 --> 01:25:54.360
presented his perspective as one of the sepsis of confidence, his tone seemed surprisingly unsure

01:25:54.360 --> 01:26:00.120
of itself and vulnerable. Jake-"Some of the people didn't necessarily agree with where I wanted to go,

01:26:00.760 --> 01:26:09.240
or what my vision was. I totally respect that. I didn't want to persuade anybody into believing

01:26:09.240 --> 01:26:18.200
in my vision. Sometimes my visions and ideas scare people because of how crazy they are."

01:26:18.200 --> 01:26:22.200
Now, in a way, it makes some semblance of sense if Jake wishes to present a more authentic version

01:26:22.200 --> 01:26:25.720
of himself when responding to this, but the uncertainty present as Jake rambles for

01:26:25.720 --> 01:26:29.800
approximately 20 minutes is far more disconcerting than reassuring. At the same time,

01:26:29.800 --> 01:26:33.800
as someone who's always seemed calculated with his content, there had to be something symbolic

01:26:33.800 --> 01:26:37.960
about his choice to go it alone. He still has members of his team, and even a couple of his

01:26:37.960 --> 01:26:42.360
inner circle that would readily back him up with these decisions. But maybe the truth was that

01:26:42.360 --> 01:26:47.480
after such disruption, he didn't know who to trust anymore. Jake-"And as I was bringing on these

01:26:47.480 --> 01:26:54.200
older business advisors and people to help me with my company, a couple of them advised me to

01:26:54.840 --> 01:26:59.560
bring somebody on into my corner who wanted nothing else but to protect me,

01:26:59.560 --> 01:27:06.120
who didn't care about my money, who I could 100% trust no matter what. And so the only person I

01:27:06.120 --> 01:27:12.040
could think of, the only person that is right for that job was my dad. Not to run my businesses and

01:27:12.040 --> 01:27:22.120
be in charge, but to simply look over the shoulders of other people who were in my businesses,

01:27:22.120 --> 01:27:29.320
who I'm entrusting to run my business, because I knew my dad would have my best interests at heart."

01:27:29.320 --> 01:27:33.400
The video was a rather futile show of strength. He emphasized the need to have people who shared

01:27:33.400 --> 01:27:37.320
his vision around him, but the problem was, if he didn't have enough people supporting that vision,

01:27:37.320 --> 01:27:41.720
how was he going to make it there? I don't think he knew exactly. Jake-"I have big goals. Like,

01:27:42.840 --> 01:27:49.160
I really, really have found recently that I am so passionate about music. And again,

01:27:49.160 --> 01:27:55.960
I just want to surround myself with people, again, who have way more experience than me,

01:27:55.960 --> 01:28:02.200
who have way more relationships than me, who have tasted victory and business success in this

01:28:02.200 --> 01:28:07.080
industry." In June, Jake attempted to launch a live show fittingly called Team 10 Live. However,

01:28:07.080 --> 01:28:11.000
by now it was clear that the team was looking rather emaciated. Although no announcement of

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:15.000
departure had been made, brothers Nathan and Cade Spicer were not present at any of these shows,

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:19.000
causing many to assume that they had also made their exits, and leaving Jake Paul's squad with

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:23.080
six members, which other commentators were more than happy to point out. The narrative

01:28:23.080 --> 01:28:26.760
was no longer that Team 10 were the worst collective to grace people's computer screens,

01:28:26.760 --> 01:28:29.880
it was that they were dying, and they were not sure what to do about it.

01:28:31.080 --> 01:28:37.320
There's a pretty beautiful irony in the fact that more than half of Team 10's most iconic song

01:28:37.320 --> 01:28:42.840
is performed by people that are no longer in Team 10. For some reason on the website it says,

01:28:42.840 --> 01:28:48.200
Team 10 tour 2018, as if to suggest that there will be more tours in the future.

01:28:49.080 --> 01:28:55.560
I just can't imagine a world where that happens. I think this was a one and done kind of deal,

01:28:55.560 --> 01:28:59.000
and if it is, I guess I'm happy I got to be a part of history.

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:03.000
Over the next few months, Team 10 continued to falter and stagnate, and although Jake expressed

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:07.400
no hostility towards former members in his May upload, as summer 2018 approached its end,

01:29:07.400 --> 01:29:11.400
Paul's attitude towards those who had left Team 10 behind appeared increasingly bitter.

01:29:11.400 --> 01:29:16.520
No, I think if you think about it, if Team 10 were together right now,

01:29:18.040 --> 01:29:21.640
it would be bigger than the Kardashians.

01:29:21.640 --> 01:29:25.320
First of all, on True Geordie's podcast where he claimed that Team 10 had the potential to be as

01:29:25.320 --> 01:29:29.080
big as the Kardashians, which is a strange statement to make about a group of people

01:29:29.080 --> 01:29:33.000
who you insisted that its whole purpose was to incubate towns and let people go whenever

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:37.240
you felt like it, and yet in spite of all this, Jake still had a spin, claiming that it was those

01:29:37.240 --> 01:29:39.320
who left who were the real failures.

01:29:39.320 --> 01:29:45.240
Till this day, I haven't made a single dollar off of Team 10. I've only invested my own money

01:29:45.240 --> 01:29:50.520
into it to make it successful. And they're like, oh, like, you owe me this, you dah, dah, dah,

01:29:50.520 --> 01:29:59.000
like, dah, dah, dah. Like, there's so much like back and forth, and it's all I wanted to do is

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:05.640
create a platform for people to like accomplish their dreams. And a lot of them have, but they

01:30:05.640 --> 01:30:11.240
still don't, they don't, I don't think they realize like what they had until it was gone.

01:30:11.240 --> 01:30:16.200
Those people needed Jake to succeed, and now he's sure they're realizing the errors of their ways.

01:30:16.200 --> 01:30:18.520
Why don't they just come crawling back already?

01:30:18.520 --> 01:30:27.160
And I think like, as we've seen like members leave Team 10, you see them all turn into nothing,

01:30:27.160 --> 01:30:34.680
and make mistakes, and fumble, and then I think they're like, oh shit, like,

01:30:35.800 --> 01:30:39.800
maybe what I had was amazing.

01:30:39.800 --> 01:30:43.080
This perspective was reiterated in Shane Dawson's Jake Paul series,

01:30:43.080 --> 01:30:46.040
where Jake once again claims that those who left had used him.

01:30:46.040 --> 01:30:48.920
I'd say like everyone who's left has used us.

01:30:48.920 --> 01:30:52.920
Yeah, because they think they can go on and do something better, and then it's like...

01:30:52.920 --> 01:30:58.040
I don't think they realize that they like used us, but when these people come into Team 10,

01:30:58.040 --> 01:30:59.480
I give them everything.

01:30:59.480 --> 01:31:03.480
Now, maybe they did, maybe they didn't, but the truth of the matter was that Jake Paul's shift

01:31:03.480 --> 01:31:07.560
in tone signified that his perspective had shifted, before he was looking for reasons

01:31:07.560 --> 01:31:11.880
why Team 10 would still be successful, and how actually everything was going according to plan.

01:31:11.880 --> 01:31:15.480
Now, though he's too proud to admit it at the time, he had clearly come to terms with the fact

01:31:15.480 --> 01:31:19.640
that Team 10 was failing, and he was looking for people to blame, but as the person who proclaimed

01:31:19.640 --> 01:31:24.120
that they had the final say, the buck stopped at him, and he seemed incapable of tending to

01:31:24.120 --> 01:31:28.600
the continued bleeding of numbers, some of whom even warned him that this scenario would repeat

01:31:28.600 --> 01:31:33.400
itself. At first Jake lost a couple members he was able to replace fairly easily, even perhaps

01:31:33.400 --> 01:31:37.240
enhancing the crew, then he lost a few more members who ultimately left a mark with viewers

01:31:37.240 --> 01:31:42.120
who cared about them and invested their emotions and finances into the group, but finally he lost

01:31:42.120 --> 01:31:46.600
integral members who he cared about and trusted more than he was prepared to admit, and members

01:31:46.600 --> 01:31:50.920
that he was unable to replenish and admit back into his inner circle. Jake's team remained at

01:31:50.920 --> 01:31:55.080
a roster of six for the summer, and the start of autumn, but come mid-October during Shane

01:31:55.080 --> 01:31:59.640
Dawson's documentary series, the fate of Team 10 would be decided once and for all.

01:31:59.640 --> 01:32:17.480
I suppose we should talk about the Shane Dawson documentary for a moment,

01:32:17.480 --> 01:32:20.120
as there is the significance of its relationship with Team 10.

01:32:20.120 --> 01:32:26.840
I just feel like I was like a pawn in like their game like they're always trying to one-up

01:32:26.840 --> 01:32:33.320
each other always like so like I was just like a goal like I was

01:32:34.680 --> 01:32:41.720
just used the whole time in Team 10 in videos and Logan's videos and everyone's I was just like

01:32:42.920 --> 01:32:46.600
I don't know it was like they're playing a game and they're like the chess masters or whatever

01:32:46.680 --> 01:32:48.680
and I was just a little fun.

01:32:50.920 --> 01:32:53.800
Throughout the series, there were a variety of interviews with former members who had left under

01:32:53.800 --> 01:32:58.520
certain circumstances, and there were occasional revelations that added context to past situations,

01:32:58.520 --> 01:33:02.760
including that Alyssa Violet had slept with Logan Paul, Nick Crompton claiming all the pranks were

01:33:02.760 --> 01:33:06.920
fake, and Jake alleging that Chance Sutton had stolen a joint account from him. These potentially

01:33:06.920 --> 01:33:11.240
added context to previous scenarios and maybe gave Jake more footing to respond to them. Throughout

01:33:11.240 --> 01:33:15.080
the series, there had been emphasis on Jake's relationship with past and present members within

01:33:15.080 --> 01:33:19.000
Team 10. There were many questions swirling on how the depleted team were going to emerge from

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:23.480
this. While so many rumours surrounded their future, they would receive an answer very soon.

01:33:23.480 --> 01:33:28.280
On October 18th, although no formal announcement was made, all of Team 10's socials were wiped

01:33:28.280 --> 01:33:32.840
completely, with a message posted on their now inactive Instagram that a new team would be coming

01:33:32.840 --> 01:33:37.160
soon. At the time, this news was taken with a grain of salt by many following the situation at hand,

01:33:37.160 --> 01:33:41.400
partly because this coincided with the climax of Shane Dawson's documentary series, with many

01:33:41.400 --> 01:33:45.240
assuming it to be a marketing plot to promote whatever Jake had planned. It's a reasonable

01:33:45.240 --> 01:33:49.240
theory, because it almost certainly would have worked, and Jake seemed to be taking aim at former

01:33:49.240 --> 01:33:53.000
members of the house again on social media. But as the final episode of this show aired,

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:57.000
people didn't exactly receive what they expected. It featured Shane sitting down with Jake,

01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:01.160
asking the questions, and allowing Mr Paul to respond to nearly every major controversy

01:34:01.160 --> 01:34:05.080
that featured himself in Team 10, many of which he never fully addressed at the time,

01:34:05.080 --> 01:34:07.560
including those involving present and former members.

01:34:25.640 --> 01:34:29.080
There are a lot of ways to interpret his responses, some of which you will not find

01:34:29.080 --> 01:34:33.560
satisfactory, as he does hold steadfast on points that many people feel strongly about,

01:34:33.560 --> 01:34:37.400
such as the claims made by the Martinez twins, which Jake dismisses as banter.

01:34:37.960 --> 01:34:42.200
On other situations, like his relationship with Alyssa Violet, Jake seems more contrite,

01:34:42.200 --> 01:34:46.120
admitting that her affair with Logan was only a response to their own toxic relationship.

01:34:46.120 --> 01:34:50.040
He navigates a variety of situations with different levels of defiance and remorse,

01:34:50.040 --> 01:34:53.240
even making a statement by deleting their face bank to upload on video.

01:34:53.240 --> 01:35:06.120
However, probably the most relevant details are the plans that Jake has for his future.

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:12.920
For me, that's why I want to completely disconnect from all of this social media shit right now,

01:35:12.920 --> 01:35:17.720
is to figure that out. What do I really like to do? What do I really want to do?

01:35:17.720 --> 01:35:21.640
What's next for me? It's like you said, it's like starting over.

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:27.320
There is a sense that, at this moment, Jake had already made up his mind on the fate of Team 10,

01:35:27.320 --> 01:35:30.280
and although this upload followed the wiping of their social media presence,

01:35:30.280 --> 01:35:34.440
it was recorded before and almost served as a retrospective justification of itself.

01:35:34.440 --> 01:35:38.680
The only significant detail that seemed to imply otherwise was this idea that a new Team 10 was in

01:35:38.680 --> 01:35:42.920
the works. How could Jake walk away from something saying he didn't want another Leaving Team 10

01:35:42.920 --> 01:35:47.240
video, but still wanted another Team 10? How could you have one without the other?

01:35:47.240 --> 01:35:50.760
It was hard to look at this and not expect another Team 10 almost immediately after the

01:35:50.760 --> 01:35:54.600
conclusion of this series, and barely a month after the disbandment of Team 10,

01:35:54.600 --> 01:35:59.720
Jake Paul posted a tweet that read, Season 3, November 25th. This led to many online

01:35:59.720 --> 01:36:03.400
concluding that this was the next roster. It made sense as Jake had retained ownership of

01:36:03.400 --> 01:36:07.320
the Team 10 house, with a few people even moving in. However, when the date came around,

01:36:07.320 --> 01:36:09.800
people got something very different to what they were expecting.

01:36:10.440 --> 01:36:15.000
For the past, like, month or so, Erika and I's relationship has been, like, super rocky.

01:36:15.560 --> 01:36:19.400
Like I said, it turned into this, like, downward spiral where we were just, like,

01:36:19.400 --> 01:36:23.960
super super toxic for each other, and we, like, know everything about each other,

01:36:23.960 --> 01:36:30.520
and, like, we know how to hurt each other, and it's so sad that it got to that point, but it did.

01:36:33.480 --> 01:36:38.120
Season 3 was, in fact, another documentary-style series which covered Jake Paul himself,

01:36:38.120 --> 01:36:42.440
his personal life, and his relationship with Erika Costell. It had been announced a few weeks

01:36:42.440 --> 01:36:45.960
prior that they had broken up, and Jake had teased the reasons for this on his channel,

01:36:45.960 --> 01:36:49.400
but in the end, what people received was a two-episode drama fest which Jake Paul

01:36:49.400 --> 01:36:53.960
discontinued for being too real. There was no prominent mention of Team 10, just Jake and a

01:36:53.960 --> 01:36:58.200
bunch of his friends trying to navigate the waters, a relationship that was beyond saving.

01:36:58.200 --> 01:37:01.640
Over the next few months, it's seen that Jake Paul was quietly taking apart the constructs

01:37:01.640 --> 01:37:05.640
that he had built Team 10 on previously, and had something else in mind, but nobody was sure what

01:37:05.640 --> 01:37:10.120
at this point. Jake Paul himself was in and out of the news, but for no particular reason other than

01:37:10.120 --> 01:37:11.480
it being Jake Paul.

01:37:11.480 --> 01:37:15.640
Jake Paul- Go to mysterybrand.net if you want to win some mystery boxes,

01:37:15.640 --> 01:37:18.120
this video was so much fun, thank you so much for watching, I love you guys,

01:37:18.120 --> 01:37:19.800
and I will see you tomorrow with another video, peace!

01:37:19.800 --> 01:37:22.840
Jake Paul- This has got to be one of the worst things I've seen on YouTube, simply because his

01:37:22.840 --> 01:37:25.320
fans are so young and so impressionable.

01:37:25.320 --> 01:37:28.120
There were crickets for months until a February vlog titled

01:37:28.120 --> 01:37:32.520
Dear YouTube, I've Been Hiding This From You, when Jake began opening up on the reasons why

01:37:32.520 --> 01:37:34.280
Team 10 was brought to an end.

01:37:34.280 --> 01:37:38.120
Jake Paul- A lot of the reason why Team 10 started to fall apart is because I wasn't able to connect

01:37:38.120 --> 01:37:44.200
with a lot of the members as people, and so I didn't understand or I wasn't able to judge

01:37:44.200 --> 01:37:47.640
whether they were good people or not, because I just was like, business, business, everyone's

01:37:47.640 --> 01:37:51.800
gonna win, everyone's gonna grow and do amazing stuff, and then you come to find out and you see

01:37:51.800 --> 01:37:58.040
bad traits and bad qualities in people. I also wasn't mature enough to be able to understand

01:37:58.040 --> 01:38:03.960
feelings and love and emotions and stuff like that, because I just got looped into business

01:38:03.960 --> 01:38:05.960
when I was 16 years old.

01:38:05.960 --> 01:38:09.480
What was said in this video wasn't necessarily a surprise, and seemed to line up with the

01:38:09.480 --> 01:38:13.400
observations that could be made towards the end of its time in the spotlight. Jake possessed

01:38:13.400 --> 01:38:17.400
serious trust issues with members and couldn't reconcile them. He felt like he couldn't continue

01:38:17.400 --> 01:38:21.720
this knowing who people really were, and thus he felt the only option was to bring the famous

01:38:21.720 --> 01:38:26.520
and infamous crew to an end. It appeared that this time there was no grand scheme, no immediate

01:38:26.520 --> 01:38:33.080
reboot, no hilarious prank, this is the way that Team 10 had ended. Not with a bang, but a whimper.

01:38:33.080 --> 01:38:37.240
And to be honest, I think that's always how Jake Paul saw it as ending, he never enjoyed the

01:38:37.240 --> 01:38:41.960
narrative of a dramatic collapse, he'd much prefer to end a project quietly and move on to the next

01:38:41.960 --> 01:38:46.440
one. Maybe that was the play, to leave everyone expecting something that wasn't coming.

01:38:46.440 --> 01:38:51.240
Jake Paul-"And that's like where there was kind of like a disconnect with a lot of the Team 10

01:38:51.240 --> 01:38:55.640
members, and even with like my best friend like Chance for example, it was just like this weird

01:38:55.640 --> 01:38:59.800
thing for all of us to get used to, and we weren't able to get used to it, so that's where a lot of

01:38:59.800 --> 01:39:04.920
like weird stuff came from." But of course, he doesn't normally talk about something without reason,

01:39:04.920 --> 01:39:09.240
and at this point, the conversation takes a turn once more towards Jake's future plans,

01:39:09.240 --> 01:39:11.480
revealing what was indeed coming up.

01:39:17.160 --> 01:39:23.000
Jake Paul-"I'm in a position, I'm 22 years old now, and who I want to be and where I see myself being

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:27.240
a couple years from now is very different than what I'm doing now." In his video, Jake seemed to

01:39:27.240 --> 01:39:31.880
reflect on the failure of Team 10 as a result of too many emotionally immature people under one

01:39:31.880 --> 01:39:36.200
roof. It's hard to know how exactly he's grown from this, but one might say that age and experience

01:39:36.200 --> 01:39:40.760
is its own form of maturity. Responding to a question asked by a fan, he seems confident that

01:39:40.760 --> 01:39:45.080
the next Team 10 will not be caught by the pitfalls that the previous one was, promising that

01:39:45.080 --> 01:39:50.760
it will be bigger and better than ever. Jake Paul-"We are working on a new Team 10 guys, we're still

01:39:50.760 --> 01:39:56.200
figuring it out, it's still very early stages, but I love Team 10, it's a genius idea, it creates like

01:39:56.200 --> 01:40:01.960
such an amazing vibe in the videos, and I want to bring that vibe back, and know that when I do

01:40:01.960 --> 01:40:06.040
bring it back, it's going to be better than ever, and it will be bigger than ever, and it's just

01:40:06.040 --> 01:40:10.520
gonna be smarter and well done, and I learned from my mistakes in the past, and I want you guys to

01:40:10.520 --> 01:40:15.480
just trust me as I rebuild the Team 10 that it's gonna be dope." However, otherwise, it didn't seem

01:40:15.480 --> 01:40:19.640
like Jake was planning on changing too much, committing to the vibes that had made the previous

01:40:19.640 --> 01:40:23.480
one a success. As you noted in this video, it was still in its early stages, and other than

01:40:23.480 --> 01:40:28.920
Jake Paul offering an internment, I mean internship, that would be paid in fun, there wouldn't be much

01:40:28.920 --> 01:40:33.240
public development on this until the end of May, where a trailer was posted on Jake Paul's channel

01:40:33.240 --> 01:40:40.040
foreshadowing the new Team 10, and how they would be presented. Jake Paul-"People don't understand

01:40:40.040 --> 01:40:44.360
how hard it is to rebuild this company, the pressures, the shit that's on my plate, I don't have

01:40:44.360 --> 01:40:50.280
a roadmap in front of me of how to do this shit, and it's fucking stressful." This seemed to take

01:40:50.280 --> 01:40:54.680
inspiration from the cancelled Jake Paul and Cut series from November, and they also mostly erased

01:40:54.680 --> 01:40:59.240
from the internet to Team 10 TV, which involved the original members. It seemed to focus more on

01:40:59.240 --> 01:41:04.280
this dramatic portrayal of Team 10 under the guise of reality. It was a bit unclear what exactly the

01:41:04.280 --> 01:41:08.680
show was going to be at this point, but there was a focus on Jake Paul and his then girlfriend Tana

01:41:08.680 --> 01:41:13.000
Moncho, who had recently gone public with their relationship. Tana's involvement would be confirmed

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:17.800
a week later with a video posted onto Team 10's channel titled, Tana is joining Team 10.

01:41:17.800 --> 01:41:21.560
Unfortunately, I can't say too much else about the video because it seems to be lost to time.

01:41:21.560 --> 01:41:26.840
However, on June the 1st, Jake Paul posted Meet The New Team 10, introducing his new entourage to

01:41:26.840 --> 01:41:37.320
the entire world. Jake Paul-"The problem is, it's hard to find actual good Team 10 talent

01:41:38.280 --> 01:41:46.280
who work hard, want to be here, don't have egos, have a talent, have the right look, are the right

01:41:46.280 --> 01:41:52.440
age. It's like there's almost like no way to find them." There are a variety of intro reels for these

01:41:52.440 --> 01:41:56.760
people who many will know barely anything about. Lots of clips of them going about their lives in

01:41:56.760 --> 01:42:01.160
the sort of shaky cam drama that many people who are interested in reality TV will be all too

01:42:01.160 --> 01:42:19.640
familiar with. It seems Jake wants to embrace the chaos and make it part of what Team 10 is known

01:42:19.640 --> 01:42:23.480
for. Whereas in the past, Jake attempted to control the narrative surrounding his squad,

01:42:23.480 --> 01:42:27.800
here he wants the narratives to create themselves from the authentic interactions between figures

01:42:27.800 --> 01:42:32.040
within the house. The roster of members appeared to be more mature this time, including the couple

01:42:32.040 --> 01:42:36.440
Tram and Core, whose son Tidus would regularly make appearances on Jake Paul's channel as well.

01:42:36.440 --> 01:42:40.440
In his February video, Jake stated he was trying to reconcile his maturing audience,

01:42:40.440 --> 01:42:45.000
the reality show style seemed to be the solution. On principle, it seemed like a good idea. One of

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:49.400
the greatest conflicts from within Team 10 was that the group often appeared blindsided by drama

01:42:49.400 --> 01:42:53.720
and tension. Team 10's proclamations of strength and good vibes were often undermined by people

01:42:53.720 --> 01:42:58.520
stating otherwise in exit videos. In this case, the drama would be integrated into Team 10,

01:42:58.520 --> 01:43:02.840
there would be negativity and suspense, and if someone left and said the atmosphere was toxic,

01:43:02.840 --> 01:43:07.640
people would just say, well we've been new, we've watched the episode. This was Jake Paul's attempt

01:43:07.640 --> 01:43:12.360
to reclaim the drama that had taken so much from him, it was the chance to have a say on his own

01:43:12.360 --> 01:43:17.400
character before other people did, and he was successful in that way, but it was still a very,

01:43:17.400 --> 01:43:18.840
very mixed blessing.

01:43:18.840 --> 01:43:23.640
You know that like, I'm business oriented, and I'm just getting straight to the fucking facts, like,

01:43:23.640 --> 01:43:27.800
yeah we're friends, but like with that shit, it's just straight to the facts, like, that's disgusting,

01:43:27.800 --> 01:43:32.920
like, you need to delete it, and here's why, and I don't want this drama, I don't have time for this

01:43:32.920 --> 01:43:39.080
drama, like, I hate having to babysit, but it's part of what we need to do with this new Team 10,

01:43:39.080 --> 01:43:44.760
because in the old one, there was no communication, and no, no one really actually managing what was

01:43:44.920 --> 01:43:45.640
going on.

01:43:45.640 --> 01:43:51.320
Jake's attempts to blend the personal and the business side on a public forum made sense in a way,

01:43:51.320 --> 01:43:55.400
because it allowed people to see the often flawed process that individuals have as humans, and the

01:43:55.400 --> 01:44:00.120
failings that occur along the way. How that perspective was at the expense of any actual interest

01:44:00.120 --> 01:44:04.680
from most people outside the immediate audience, it played out more like something you'd see on a rather

01:44:04.680 --> 01:44:09.320
tabloid cable channel rather than actual YouTube content. Viewership on each of these videos was a

01:44:09.320 --> 01:44:14.120
few million, and although many of these viewers seemed interested, a lot just weren't even bothering

01:44:14.120 --> 01:44:18.600
to click on them. Jake having full control of these aspects made the content unappealing, and

01:44:18.600 --> 01:44:23.240
dampened the conflict, limiting the actual reach of videos. In fact, the only major drama that was

01:44:23.240 --> 01:44:27.320
reported on by sources outside of Jake Paul in the first month of this airing was when a pair

01:44:27.320 --> 01:44:31.320
of transgender women revealed they were kicked out of the house for their gender identity. You didn't

01:44:31.320 --> 01:44:35.960
see that in the Team 10 uncut, did you? It played into this perception that this was still highly

01:44:35.960 --> 01:44:37.240
processed content.

01:44:38.200 --> 01:44:42.920
So do you want your room, or do you want to finish the conversation? Where do you want to go? Do you

01:44:42.920 --> 01:44:46.440
want to end this on a good communicative term, or what?

01:44:46.440 --> 01:44:51.960
It's over, Jake. I've got an argument with you. We're on Team 10 uncut. I don't give a fuck. I'm

01:44:51.960 --> 01:44:54.920
hooked by sin, but we're letting you on the new land.

01:44:54.920 --> 01:44:59.000
People didn't trust this sort of candid media from Jake, because people didn't trust him.

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:02.760
Additionally, it lacked the chemistry and dynamics that the original Team 10 possessed. There was

01:45:02.760 --> 01:45:06.600
nothing wrong with these people, but at the same time, the reality style aspect really

01:45:06.600 --> 01:45:10.840
sapped the personality from these individuals, many of whom could never recreate the energy of

01:45:10.840 --> 01:45:15.240
a Martinez or a Chance, and I can't believe I'm even saying that. Almost as soon as Jake Paul

01:45:15.240 --> 01:45:20.040
went back to posting normal content with Tana and a few others, his views jumped up significantly.

01:45:20.040 --> 01:45:24.120
This led them to try merging these two together with a video clip baiting a couple's fight,

01:45:24.120 --> 01:45:28.600
but even that couldn't inspire mass viewership. Episode 11 was released over a month and a half

01:45:28.600 --> 01:45:33.560
later to a rather underwhelming response, and despite the promise of season 2, Team 10 uncut

01:45:33.560 --> 01:45:38.360
was quietly ushered off the channel after 11 episodes, with normal content resuming soon

01:45:38.360 --> 01:45:42.920
after. The last video uploaded to the Team 10 channel was on the 21st July 2019, which

01:45:42.920 --> 01:45:47.400
appears to feature a reduced roster and an energy that was somewhat subdued. Maybe Jake knew that

01:45:47.400 --> 01:45:58.680
finally, this time, it was the end of the line. Jake Paul had taken an extensive break to

01:45:58.680 --> 01:46:03.000
recalibrate and rebuild Team 10 from the ground up. He had invested a lot of time and energy into

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:08.120
making this one of his most finely tuned ventures on his channel yet, but people weren't fighting.

01:46:08.120 --> 01:46:12.600
I doubt many people even knew there was a second Team 10. Although Jake never officially brought

01:46:12.600 --> 01:46:16.920
it to an end, stating in interviews that more would be coming soon, his plans for the crew

01:46:16.920 --> 01:46:21.800
never really re-emerged, and although he kept some members around, Team 10 itself

01:46:22.360 --> 01:46:25.640
was effectively over. Team 10 was dead.

01:46:33.080 --> 01:46:37.480
There were continued hints and allusions by Jake Paul that Team 10 would eventually return,

01:46:37.480 --> 01:46:41.320
but as I mentioned earlier, there has been no follow through on such, and any social media

01:46:41.320 --> 01:46:45.560
presence they previously possessed has been mostly erased, including their channel which Jake has

01:46:45.560 --> 01:46:50.920
now transformed into his Boxing Center podcast, BS with Jake Paul. Probably the most indicative

01:46:50.920 --> 01:46:55.400
sign that Team 10 was a done deal was the fact that Jake Paul sold his house in 2021,

01:46:55.400 --> 01:46:59.720
stating that he intended to move out of LA and focus on his mission to become the greatest

01:46:59.720 --> 01:47:04.520
prize fighter in the world. In that sense, such an entourage may hold him back. It also didn't help

01:47:04.520 --> 01:47:09.000
that in the years following its cessation, Team 10's legacy has been marred by continued claims

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:13.240
of extremely improper and unprofessional behaviour, coming from people who were formerly associated

01:47:13.240 --> 01:47:17.640
with the group, and even people who weren't. These are not like claims, and in certain industries

01:47:17.720 --> 01:47:22.440
would be taken very seriously, but Jake Paul is like a proverbial steamroller for his brand,

01:47:22.440 --> 01:47:27.880
and his responses either amount to no response or threatening to sue. Jake doesn't care, I doubt he

01:47:27.880 --> 01:47:33.000
ever will, but as far as Team 10 is concerned, he seems happier without them now, and I have a hunch

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:37.320
the feeling is mutual. Most former members appear to have found some success in the careers they've

01:47:37.320 --> 01:47:41.480
decided to pursue, with a couple like the Dobres even staying in the clickbait game.

01:47:41.480 --> 01:47:45.800
It's a testament to the sort of environment that we were living in 2017 that Team 10 existed,

01:47:45.800 --> 01:47:49.400
and how they were treated by the public in general. It made sense there was this contempt

01:47:49.400 --> 01:47:53.640
for them given their behaviour, but very few people really looked beyond that at the time.

01:47:53.640 --> 01:47:58.520
I've heard people say that they missed the 2017 drama when it felt less serious, but the claims

01:47:58.520 --> 01:48:02.600
weren't less serious, it's just the way people treated them were. The prevailing narrative was

01:48:02.600 --> 01:48:06.600
that Team 10 is annoying, obnoxious, and therefore bad, and don't get me wrong, they're not good

01:48:06.600 --> 01:48:11.080
things to be, but over time, the concerns relating to a group like that became greater and greater,

01:48:11.080 --> 01:48:15.160
and their reputation, although not given much thought since, would likely sour in the public

01:48:15.240 --> 01:48:19.160
mind or review. Is there anything vaguely positive at all that one can say about them?

01:48:19.160 --> 01:48:22.760
Jake, it's every day bro, peace, peace bro, we're all dead.

01:48:22.760 --> 01:48:27.240
There have been creator houses before, but none popularised the idea like Team 10,

01:48:27.240 --> 01:48:31.160
and I don't believe it was just the luck of the draw, it was obviously highly calculated,

01:48:31.160 --> 01:48:35.400
and at the core was a strong business mind who knew how to market himself and others in the form

01:48:35.400 --> 01:48:40.280
of Jake Paul, an individual simultaneously able to be a successful public figure and a business one

01:48:40.280 --> 01:48:44.360
required a lot of skills, and Jake Paul demonstrated that he could do either in creating

01:48:44.360 --> 01:48:48.600
Team 10. The challenge came with actually balancing them, and trying to navigate interpersonal

01:48:48.600 --> 01:48:52.440
relationships alongside them, which was a challenge given that Jake Paul seems like a bit

01:48:52.440 --> 01:48:57.080
of a toxic person, an observation that became evident to many over time. We'll talk more about

01:48:57.080 --> 01:49:02.360
him personally in a bit, but for the team itself to succeed, it needed a lot more than it had.

01:49:02.360 --> 01:49:06.520
Hey, hey, this is my vlog channel, get the f*** out of the camera. Hey man, this is my vlog channel.

01:49:06.520 --> 01:49:11.400
On the surface, Team 10's real success was lasting as long as they did, from the It's Every Day Bro

01:49:11.400 --> 01:49:15.480
music video, and all the uploads, drum, and controversy that followed it. I have not been

01:49:15.480 --> 01:49:19.160
able to go into detail about a lot of it because this video would have been so much longer than

01:49:19.160 --> 01:49:23.560
planned, but the group was a ticking time bomb that could have resulted in much worse than it did.

01:49:23.560 --> 01:49:28.040
Nick Crompton would dismiss prank content as fake to try and make it seem more inconsequential,

01:49:28.040 --> 01:49:31.960
and to possibly counter those claims that these japes cause visible harm, but regardless of how

01:49:31.960 --> 01:49:36.200
much of it was planned, there was tangibly a real element to it, and in trying to fulfil that sort

01:49:36.200 --> 01:49:40.280
of YouTube insanity image, there were multiple times when the project could have just imploded

01:49:40.280 --> 01:49:45.320
dramatically and given Jake the PR nightmare that he dreaded, so many close calls. Team 10

01:49:45.320 --> 01:49:49.640
delicately walked the line of what was acceptable content to upload onto YouTube, and one can't help

01:49:49.640 --> 01:49:53.560
but wonder if they would have crossed it if Jake's brother hadn't done so before. The off-camera

01:49:53.560 --> 01:49:57.800
lifestyle of Team 10 was often reported in a rather unflattering light too, and yes, in a way

01:49:57.800 --> 01:50:01.560
it can't be surprising that Jake Paul seemingly created a frat house environment, but a lot of

01:50:01.560 --> 01:50:06.040
members didn't sign up to that, especially considering factors like background and age.

01:50:06.040 --> 01:50:10.040
It was not something that everyone would have been happy to be a part of, but they didn't feel like

01:50:10.040 --> 01:50:14.440
they had a say. Additionally, the general claims of individual maltreatment of those within the

01:50:14.440 --> 01:50:18.760
house after they left were damning in their own right. It's obviously hard to evaluate the verity

01:50:18.760 --> 01:50:23.240
of every last claim, but Jake seldom sought to deny a lot of them, he often dismissed or downplayed

01:50:23.240 --> 01:50:27.800
them as misunderstandings and banter that had gone wrong, yet even if that was the case, it underlined

01:50:27.800 --> 01:50:31.960
a fundamental problem of having something like Team 10 and what they offered, this idea that they

01:50:31.960 --> 01:50:36.520
could take a smaller, inexperienced, often younger creator and grow their channel, but with one

01:50:36.600 --> 01:50:39.960
massive condition, which is that you have to tolerate this group of people who are more

01:50:39.960 --> 01:50:43.800
influential than you. You have to live in their house, and you have to deal with their antics.

01:50:43.800 --> 01:50:48.120
Maybe nothing was designed with malice or intent to exploit, but Jake implicitly created an

01:50:48.120 --> 01:50:52.600
environment that individuals would inherently feel rather trapped in. A brief read of a psychological

01:50:52.600 --> 01:50:56.440
study on conformity and compliance would have told you that what they were creating could never

01:50:56.440 --> 01:51:00.920
function healthily, but it kept happening. The greater problem with this environment is when

01:51:00.920 --> 01:51:05.240
someone does decide to depart, it's always more dramatic. Leaving Team 10 videos didn't just

01:51:05.240 --> 01:51:09.240
manifest as a trend because they were a fun thing to make, they existed because individuals

01:51:09.240 --> 01:51:13.480
found their personal feelings caught up in this space that they felt trapped in, they'd crafted

01:51:13.480 --> 01:51:17.560
a relationship with an audience who felt like they were a part of the team and that leaving would be

01:51:17.560 --> 01:51:21.960
a betrayal of sorts, something that core members would occasionally refer to. These videos weren't

01:51:21.960 --> 01:51:26.680
solely created as a way to attack Team 10, it was a way to rationalise their own decision to the

01:51:26.680 --> 01:51:31.480
outside world. Every exit video felt like a stab to the Team 10 image, and yet every time they

01:51:31.480 --> 01:51:35.000
persisted, while proclaiming that they knew exactly what they were doing. If they knew what

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:38.680
they were doing, then they'd know that they were trying to trap smaller creators in a collective

01:51:38.680 --> 01:51:42.520
by offering them more influence and making it contingent on living in a house with a commitment

01:51:42.520 --> 01:51:47.640
to millions of fans. But maybe Jake did know what he was doing, maybe he wanted to create a Team 10

01:51:47.640 --> 01:51:51.720
that was fully submissive and under his thumb. Some people had noted his controlling nature,

01:51:51.720 --> 01:51:56.760
he's a businessman and clearly has the ability to be methodical. He knew that if he had a consistent

01:51:56.760 --> 01:52:01.320
roster that didn't feel like they could or should leave, then he should have a cash cow for at least

01:52:01.320 --> 01:52:05.960
a few years, and yet in less than a year and a half it was practically over. A year and a half

01:52:05.960 --> 01:52:10.920
was impressive innings given how catastrophic it could have been, but Jake always wanted Team 10

01:52:10.920 --> 01:52:15.880
to be more, as shown by his presentation of it in interviews and messaging. He wanted to make as

01:52:15.880 --> 01:52:21.480
much money from the concept as possible, and by failing to ensure their longevity, he fell short

01:52:21.480 --> 01:52:28.280
of that goal. So, why does someone as supposedly successful as Jake Paul fail so miserably?

01:52:31.320 --> 01:52:41.160
Jake Paul appeared to have a plan for Team 10. That plan was to bring a load of smaller craters

01:52:41.160 --> 01:52:45.880
into one space and use Team 10 as a way to gradually grow their channels, and in return he would have a

01:52:45.880 --> 01:52:51.240
share of their success. Some people go and want to go off on their own, but it doesn't necessarily

01:52:51.240 --> 01:52:56.280
mean they're not a part of the Team 10 family. We've still got percentages though, lonesome, and

01:52:56.280 --> 01:53:00.120
precision. Although this wasn't spoken about too much, there were general allusions to contracts

01:53:00.120 --> 01:53:03.880
that would provide Jake Paul with a cut of a person's revenue, even if they left the YouTube

01:53:03.880 --> 01:53:08.200
collective. However, I don't think the intention of that contract was just to let Jake Paul have a

01:53:08.200 --> 01:53:12.840
share of income after someone left. Jake had more than enough money. Moreover, it was to encourage

01:53:12.840 --> 01:53:16.680
people to stay and make money with him, because deep down Jake Paul knew that a continuously

01:53:16.680 --> 01:53:21.000
changing roster of creators would not be good for brand identity, and he had to create something

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:25.880
that was successful enough to make a person stay, but not successful enough to make a person leave.

01:53:25.880 --> 01:53:30.920
In essence, Team 10 was conceptualised as a honeypot for smaller creators. Jake Paul knew

01:53:30.920 --> 01:53:35.800
that he had to make Team 10 an internet presence to guarantee his success, but he always seemed

01:53:35.800 --> 01:53:39.640
cautious about how much power he was willing to grant them, from the simple decision of uploading

01:53:39.640 --> 01:53:44.280
a significant portion of Team 10 content onto his own channel, calling the fans Jake Paulers,

01:53:44.280 --> 01:53:48.040
to having an inner circle that oversaw a large majority of creative decisions. When people

01:53:48.040 --> 01:53:52.280
raised certain concerns, he would supposedly reference PR, and how it would look if people left,

01:53:52.280 --> 01:53:55.880
but it's also possible he didn't want people to live anywhere else than the house, because

01:53:55.880 --> 01:54:00.280
that removal might give them some independence to make decisions about their future. He wanted fans

01:54:00.280 --> 01:54:05.080
to be devoted to the holistic idea of Team 10 first, and any members other than himself second,

01:54:05.080 --> 01:54:10.120
to maintain that threat of financial consequence if they did walk out, this idea that the fans

01:54:10.120 --> 01:54:14.760
would not follow them out the door. The English Tudor story illustrated that although Jake may

01:54:14.760 --> 01:54:19.400
have wanted to lift people up in a way, he wanted to keep them beneath him all the same, he wanted

01:54:19.400 --> 01:54:23.160
to be their lifeline, if they walked away then they would be out of that spotlight he had provided

01:54:23.160 --> 01:54:27.000
them with, and he was a well connected industry individual with roles on mainstream television.

01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:31.320
During the first months, this plan appeared to work, and even when it was tested by a situation

01:54:31.320 --> 01:54:35.480
such as Alyssa Violet's departure, it didn't seem to dent the brand too much because a majority of

01:54:35.480 --> 01:54:40.520
fans were more interested in what Jake and Team 10 had to say about it than the situation itself.

01:54:40.520 --> 01:54:43.400
This all changed, however, when they released It's Everyday Bro.

01:54:43.400 --> 01:54:57.240
It's Everyday Bro was a stroke of marketing genius that I have no doubt was as intentionally

01:54:57.240 --> 01:55:01.560
eye catching as many people found it, but at the same time, it was too eye catching for what

01:55:01.560 --> 01:55:06.200
Jake Paul had intended, because it gave the members of Team 10 a never before known presence within

01:55:06.200 --> 01:55:10.920
the online world. There was no real way to predict this level of virality, sure, songs in the past

01:55:10.920 --> 01:55:15.160
would become popular for being particularly bad, but really I think Jake was just more interested

01:55:15.160 --> 01:55:19.800
in making a simple track with immature lyrics that his target demographic would consume.

01:55:19.800 --> 01:55:24.440
Before Jake, Paul was just known as this businessman influencer at the helm of Team 10 who

01:55:24.440 --> 01:55:29.080
would draw attention for his occasional wild antics. You ask the average netizen before the 31st of

01:55:29.080 --> 01:55:33.480
May about any of the members in Team 10 and you would receive a blank stare, but after there was

01:55:33.480 --> 01:55:37.560
this sense that these individuals had possessed their own status, and even if that status were

01:55:37.560 --> 01:55:41.800
treated negatively, it was still a power of sorts that could be wielded in a way that Jake Paul

01:55:41.800 --> 01:55:46.920
didn't like, it was associated with the brand. The winds of change were indicated by a list of

01:55:46.920 --> 01:55:50.920
violence video, even though she had left months prior, she clearly sensed that public opinion was

01:55:50.920 --> 01:55:55.080
turning against Team 10, and felt like she had a space to release an impactful video on her

01:55:55.080 --> 01:55:59.240
experience with Jake Paul. This was obviously exacerbated by the supposition that Jake was

01:55:59.240 --> 01:56:04.520
referring to her in It's Everyday Bro, but even if he wasn't, she clearly felt empowered in that moment.

01:56:04.520 --> 01:56:09.960
Something clicks in your head, like you want to kill someone, but you want to cry, and you want to

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:14.520
get revenge, but you can't. It's like so hard to explain.

01:56:14.520 --> 01:56:19.080
Her video undermined this likely prevailing narrative from within Team 10, that if you walked away,

01:56:19.080 --> 01:56:23.880
you'd lose everything that Jake had given you, that you'd be cut off from industry and a future within it.

01:56:23.880 --> 01:56:28.600
As Team 10 became public enemy number one, Jake appeared to be losing his grasp on what he had

01:56:28.600 --> 01:56:33.080
created. His behaviour became increasingly controversial and irrational, some might say they

01:56:33.240 --> 01:56:36.680
were pushing the boundaries of content for entertainment and attention, but in doing this and

01:56:36.680 --> 01:56:40.840
landing himself with a ton of negative publicity, he began to lose the credibility within the

01:56:40.840 --> 01:56:45.000
industry that he held before, including his Disney show. It was hard to tell whether he thought that

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:48.920
this behaviour would cement his status amongst the remaining members, but really, it just made him

01:56:48.920 --> 01:56:53.080
less and less powerful, to the point that even his supposedly serious moments were challenged

01:56:53.080 --> 01:56:57.640
fervently from all those outside his echo chamber. When he tried to play his hand against Alyssa,

01:56:57.640 --> 01:57:01.800
attempting to punish her for leaving, he showed that he really possessed very little.

01:57:01.800 --> 01:57:06.920
Alright guys, so I'm in a Skype call right now with someone who is a part of Team 10, as well as

01:57:06.920 --> 01:57:12.360
was there, present, a witness to everything that happened on the night that I allegedly assaulted

01:57:12.360 --> 01:57:16.920
Megan Zelli, who is the assistant of Jake Paul. The tide was turning, and Jake no longer had the

01:57:16.920 --> 01:57:21.400
credentials to back up this idea that he could be a decisive figure in a person's career, and over

01:57:21.400 --> 01:57:25.640
time, members began to peel off gradually, some more quietly than others. There was far less at

01:57:25.640 --> 01:57:30.120
stake for one's reputation to disassociate from Jake Paul and Team 10, arguably it became the

01:57:30.120 --> 01:57:34.600
smarter thing to do to move on from the team that had become so ubiquitously maligned.

01:57:34.600 --> 01:57:38.840
When your reputation is in the gutter like that, your power is reduced, and whether or not Jake

01:57:38.840 --> 01:57:42.840
realised that, he didn't appear to adjust his behaviour with mind to it. However, one of the

01:57:42.840 --> 01:57:47.160
more pivotal moments that appeared to influence Jake's power over many of those around him was

01:57:47.160 --> 01:57:51.560
one that is often overlooked, the moving of the Team 10 house. In this case, the accommodation

01:57:51.560 --> 01:57:55.560
was clearly a means to control those within the four walls of the Team 10 residence, however,

01:57:55.560 --> 01:57:59.800
when they moved house, four people did not move with them, and none of those four people

01:57:59.800 --> 01:58:04.040
returned. Firstly, Martinez Twins, who formally left in November, followed by Tristan Tessa,

01:58:04.040 --> 01:58:07.640
who left in the new year, Tessa moving in with Tristan, who had never resided with the rest of

01:58:07.640 --> 01:58:12.200
the crew anyway. It once again seemed to prove that once members were out of that sphere of power,

01:58:12.200 --> 01:58:16.440
they would feel more comfortable walking away. The only people who appeared to stay longer for

01:58:16.440 --> 01:58:20.200
a year at this point were those in his inner circle, this made sense as these people appeared

01:58:20.200 --> 01:58:24.520
to have some control over the direction of the team. Nevertheless, they were also prominent

01:58:24.520 --> 01:58:29.480
members in the group's image, and therefore had to be treated with extreme care. Yet, in a final

01:58:29.480 --> 01:58:34.520
massive faux pas, Jake involved his father, who was either ignorant or dismissive to the role that

01:58:34.520 --> 01:58:39.160
these people played, and his supposedly aggressive auditing style pushed critical members out of the

01:58:39.160 --> 01:58:43.880
circle who had shared that control with Jake, leaving him with full control but a depleted

01:58:43.880 --> 01:58:49.720
group, and a fate practically sealed. In barely a year, Jake had lost complete control, from the

01:58:49.720 --> 01:58:54.040
businessman whose members relied on him to develop their skills and influence, to the laughing stock

01:58:54.040 --> 01:58:59.240
of a frat boy who called their father in when the pressure got too much, and paid the price for it.

01:58:59.240 --> 01:59:04.280
Although it was true that Team 10 couldn't exist without Jake Paul, it couldn't exist with Jake Paul

01:59:04.280 --> 01:59:07.160
either, and maybe it's fate was sealed from the start.

01:59:14.600 --> 01:59:18.680
In the February 2018 video that Jake Paul published covering Team 10's demise,

01:59:18.680 --> 01:59:23.400
he reflects on how he struggled to get a read on members, and to really trust their intent,

01:59:23.400 --> 01:59:28.200
and that makes sense to me, but I don't think it came down to the issue that he was unable to trust

01:59:28.200 --> 01:59:32.600
these people, I think it came down to the fact that he was unable to understand people's needs

01:59:32.600 --> 01:59:36.600
and actually look out for them. I don't have a doubt that if Jake Paul believed that he had an

01:59:36.600 --> 01:59:41.320
option to keep members at Team 10 that didn't involve the tactics he executed, then he may well

01:59:41.320 --> 01:59:45.720
have just done that, but it could well be an issue of being raised in an environment where the only

01:59:45.720 --> 01:59:51.080
way to get what you want was through emotionally manipulative stratagems. He would regularly try

01:59:51.080 --> 01:59:55.720
to keep people under the Team 10 roof, would become hostile if his plans were challenged,

01:59:55.720 --> 02:00:00.120
would attempt to punish those who left, even if he claimed to be all about peace and love,

02:00:00.120 --> 02:00:05.320
he had to show what would happen if they left to make sure they remained, but he lost that power

02:00:05.320 --> 02:00:10.200
to keep people in his life. Jake set up Team 10 with the goal of making as much money as possible

02:00:10.200 --> 02:00:14.440
essentially, but sometimes you have to invest in people to keep them around rather than just try

02:00:14.440 --> 02:00:18.760
to keep them under your thumb, but for a person who wanted to create an incubator for future talent,

02:00:18.840 --> 02:00:22.440
Jake didn't trust those people enough to support them in ways that they needed,

02:00:22.440 --> 02:00:27.000
he was more comfortable holding them hostage in Team 10 purgatory which made them feel the need

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:31.880
to escape. To me, I think of the dichotomy between a rich servant and a poor master,

02:00:31.880 --> 02:00:36.280
what Jake offered all of the members of Team 10 would inevitably make them a lot of money at some

02:00:36.280 --> 02:00:40.920
point, even if they never derived any actual income from Jake Paul himself, but value isn't

02:00:40.920 --> 02:00:45.240
singly derived from what's in your bank account, it's an intersection of a lot of aspects and

02:00:45.240 --> 02:00:50.120
assets of one's life, and there's a point as well where someone will be happy with what they've made,

02:00:50.120 --> 02:00:54.920
different people have different meanings of enough. For Jake Paul, I don't think anything

02:00:54.920 --> 02:00:58.680
was ever enough for him, and so he struggled to empathise with people who actually did want

02:00:58.680 --> 02:01:03.480
something simpler. Jake saw what he was giving as the ultimate sign of commitment and investment,

02:01:03.480 --> 02:01:07.000
that he was growing these people's channels and providing them with a route to stardom,

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:11.480
and in return they just had to relinquish some form of control over their lives, which he was

02:01:11.480 --> 02:01:15.560
more than ready to make the most of. He always seemed to think that anything he gave to people

02:01:15.560 --> 02:01:19.880
should be returned in a transactional sense with emotional loyalty, but the moment you do a favour

02:01:19.880 --> 02:01:24.920
with the expectation of something in return, well it's no longer a favour. Those people didn't use

02:01:24.920 --> 02:01:27.920
you, you tried to use them and failed.

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:32.000
If Adam is a talent manager and he's going to be helping you get deals, he's going to be helping you

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:40.000
protect your brand, I didn't even know he was your talent manager, I thought he was in team 10 with us,

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:46.960
so that's another issue of this communication, that I thought he's a homie that's in team 10 with us,

02:01:46.960 --> 02:01:50.000
that's dating Lauren, a part of team 10 as well.

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:54.400
There's this episode of Team 10 Uncut where Jake Paul has this rather awkward exchange with a member

02:01:54.400 --> 02:01:59.120
regarding a situation, and many observed in the comments how he seemed to be incapable of balancing

02:01:59.120 --> 02:02:03.440
his personal capacities with his professional capacities. This was always one of the key problems,

02:02:03.440 --> 02:02:07.280
because whenever he did something that may have negatively affected someone or upset them,

02:02:07.280 --> 02:02:10.960
it was business to him, but whenever someone did something in return that bothered him,

02:02:10.960 --> 02:02:15.120
it was personal. It was the case when people left and he said it was business, but clearly felt like

02:02:15.120 --> 02:02:18.960
he was used because they didn't reciprocate his investment, and it was the case with a list of

02:02:18.960 --> 02:02:22.640
sleeping with Logan after Jake had seemingly slept with multiple women during an emotionally

02:02:22.640 --> 02:02:28.160
dysfunctional and abusive relationship. He was so robust, and yet so fragile, so methodic,

02:02:28.160 --> 02:02:33.920
and yet so unnecessarily vindictive. It's strange to think how different this timeline may be if

02:02:33.920 --> 02:02:38.560
Jake didn't think to scatter the verses of his breakout hit with excessive references to the

02:02:38.560 --> 02:02:43.200
person he had evicted a few months before. Alyssa may never have made that video.

02:02:43.200 --> 02:02:49.680
Alyssa- I decided to be savage like him, and it ended with me being homeless.

02:02:49.680 --> 02:02:54.080
In the end, it just led to very unhealthy dynamics between himself and other members,

02:02:54.080 --> 02:02:58.640
who had a lot less influence than him. It made the Team 10 house a very exhausting atmosphere

02:02:58.640 --> 02:03:02.400
for some, and create a relationship with Jake Paul where people never really knew where they

02:03:02.400 --> 02:03:07.120
stood. It wasn't just a case of Jake Paul being unable to trust other people, it was a case of

02:03:07.120 --> 02:03:11.280
other people being unable to trust Jake Paul, and when you have a large group with a defined

02:03:11.280 --> 02:03:15.280
ringleader, then you need to be able to put your faith in that person. To me, Jake Paul's claims

02:03:15.280 --> 02:03:19.040
that everything was fake was a way to cope with the fact that he didn't know where to set the

02:03:19.040 --> 02:03:22.880
boundaries of reality in his interpersonal relationships with his colleagues and friends.

02:03:22.880 --> 02:03:27.280
His commitment to maximising Team 10's profits while trying to use his personal self created

02:03:27.280 --> 02:03:31.680
a conflict where his supposed friends didn't know who he was. This was demonstrated when he tried

02:03:31.680 --> 02:03:36.640
to revive Team 10 with a show that operates in a genre where a lot of content is often fabricated,

02:03:36.640 --> 02:03:41.200
seemingly under the expectation that that's what people wanted to see. They wanted the drama, sure,

02:03:41.200 --> 02:03:45.120
they wanted the fight, sure, Jake wanted to give them that, but without any of the actual stakes

02:03:45.120 --> 02:03:49.680
outside of the channel. Unfortunately for Jake, that aspect of realism was what made the original

02:03:49.680 --> 02:03:54.080
Team 10 so interesting and fascinating for viewers. What makes YouTube successful in that way

02:03:54.080 --> 02:03:58.560
is that people do feel involved and closer to these creators, the drama, responses, uploads,

02:03:58.560 --> 02:04:02.640
commentary. It made people feel close to the action and gave them this affinity to those

02:04:02.640 --> 02:04:06.720
involved, whether they were on Jake's side or not. It is ironic that even after being shunned by much

02:04:06.720 --> 02:04:11.120
of the mainstream industry, Jake still wanted to give people a Disney Channel version of Team 10

02:04:11.120 --> 02:04:15.760
drama. Jake's desire for complete control of a narrative ultimately compromised the reason why

02:04:15.760 --> 02:04:20.400
Team 10 was so successful in the first place though, this was only Team 10 by name, very few

02:04:20.400 --> 02:04:25.040
people will ever think of that name and think of these people. No offence to them, but maybe it's

02:04:25.040 --> 02:04:29.440
not a name you want to be associated with anyway. Jake Paul will always be the first name that comes

02:04:29.440 --> 02:04:34.720
to people's minds, and that's what Jake Paul wanted. He was the founder, he was the innovator,

02:04:34.720 --> 02:04:40.160
he was the communicator, and so much more, but he was never everything. Even if Jake Paul was

02:04:40.160 --> 02:04:45.280
the centrepiece of Team 10, even if he was the secret sauce, as he called it. The reason that a

02:04:45.280 --> 02:04:49.680
secret sauce can remain secret is the presence of other ingredients, and when something comes

02:04:49.680 --> 02:04:53.840
together, and when something works, you make sure you keep those ingredients there. Most people

02:04:53.840 --> 02:04:58.240
don't leave squads because they don't like drama, they're musicians that remained together for decades

02:04:58.240 --> 02:05:02.720
despite hating each other. If there was something worth staying for, then many of those who left

02:05:02.720 --> 02:05:07.440
would, but Jake's ego was too big to give people a reason to stay, continuously claiming that it was

02:05:07.440 --> 02:05:12.720
all under control while watching the ship sink, involving people incapable of resolving the glaring

02:05:12.720 --> 02:05:17.040
flaws and maintaining a personal environment where others wanted to be, discarding the mantra

02:05:17.040 --> 02:05:23.760
that he started the team under, for the talent, by the talent. What sort of talent is your father?

02:05:23.760 --> 02:05:39.040
Crowd Cheers

02:05:39.040 --> 02:05:43.920
The success of Team 10 was a recipe that captured the imagination of youngsters all over the world,

02:05:43.920 --> 02:05:48.640
alongside the ire of many creators and commentators who wondered what their appeal even was.

02:05:48.640 --> 02:05:53.200
Well, it appealed to the most primitive idea of success, the freedom to just live as recklessly

02:05:53.200 --> 02:05:57.440
as you wish every day and hit a reset button before the next one starts. Do whatever the hell

02:05:57.440 --> 02:06:01.760
you want, however you want. With the power of producing and editing, they successfully crafted

02:06:01.760 --> 02:06:06.400
that image for millions of people. However, there are a fair few reasons why we don't live like that

02:06:06.400 --> 02:06:11.280
most of the time, and as Team 10 became more notorious and unstable, those reasons became clear.

02:06:11.280 --> 02:06:15.440
You can't hit a reset button at the end of the day, the reckless behaviour will stick with people

02:06:15.440 --> 02:06:19.680
to the point where they won't want to be a part of that life anymore. It's not something they'll

02:06:19.680 --> 02:06:24.320
want to do, they came to that house with massive dreams, but all they received was an early wakeup

02:06:24.320 --> 02:06:29.360
call. Most people can't and won't live like that, and I don't think Jake ever properly comprehended

02:06:29.360 --> 02:06:33.520
that. Maybe he just didn't want to, and would have rather continued to live in his fantasy of

02:06:33.520 --> 02:06:37.840
excess, but his failure to address the fact that sometimes people just want a bit of their life to

02:06:37.840 --> 02:06:42.320
themselves was what cost him their company, it served as a reminder that there are some things

02:06:42.320 --> 02:06:48.160
you can never fully control. For all the highs and lows, Team 10 lived like it died, at the hands of

02:06:48.160 --> 02:06:53.600
a man who's ego was too great for one, but not enough for ten. Whether it could have amounted to

02:06:53.600 --> 02:06:58.400
something greater is a question that will never likely be answered, but perhaps that's for the best.

02:06:59.200 --> 02:07:04.960
It's over now, and to be honest I can't ever see it coming back, but for a few months in 2017,

02:07:05.760 --> 02:07:10.960
for better and for worse, it really was every day. Bro.

02:07:18.960 --> 02:07:37.680
So yeah, that was the video, I hope you enjoyed it, it was certainly an experience for me. I'd like to

02:07:37.680 --> 02:07:43.280
give a big thanks to the editors as always, they've done a great job, and I appreciate all their work,

02:07:43.280 --> 02:07:47.520
and there are some really really good edits in this one, so I hope you appreciated that too. I'd

02:07:47.520 --> 02:07:53.360
like to give a big thanks to the post editor, Kojak, person on audio, who I assume will be

02:07:53.360 --> 02:07:59.760
Linuski, but we can change this bit if it's not. Thumbnail artist, Staffo, fantastic work as always,

02:07:59.760 --> 02:08:04.720
big shout out to my patrons, $10 plus patrons on the screen now, but also have to give a special

02:08:04.720 --> 02:08:10.720
shout out to the $50 patrons, Seri Tisch, Esther Bedoya, and Hypercube, thank you as always for

02:08:10.720 --> 02:08:15.680
your support, I really appreciate it. Big shout out to the artists, all their credits will be in

02:08:15.680 --> 02:08:21.120
the pinned comment alongside editors and so on. If your art appears in this video and you want

02:08:21.120 --> 02:08:26.160
the credit for it, then just let me know. Also a big shout out to the sponsor Surfshark, it's been

02:08:26.160 --> 02:08:30.960
a pleasure working with you as always, and I look forward to doing it again very soon. And just a

02:08:30.960 --> 02:08:36.560
reminder that it is code opinion you need, code opinion for 3 months free. I don't really know

02:08:36.560 --> 02:08:41.680
if I have too much else to add, but I hope you guys are taking care of yourselves and looking

02:08:41.680 --> 02:08:46.960
after yourself as it finally begins to cool down up here for the winter. So I hope you guys have

02:08:46.960 --> 02:08:53.680
a good day, good week, good month, but until then, I'm The Right Opinion, and I will see you in the next one. Thank you.

02:09:11.680 --> 02:09:19.920
Bye.
