1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:26,160
If we don't do this, we're done for.

2
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,160
I can't get in.

3
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,760
Okay, we have to try something different.

4
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:29,760
I just sent you a link.

5
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:30,760
Have you got it?

6
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:31,760
I got it.

7
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:32,760
There's only 90 seconds left.

8
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:33,760
We are running out of time.

9
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:34,760
Okay, open it.

10
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:39,760
Set location to Ashburn and click continue.

11
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:40,760
Done.

12
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:44,080
Quickly reload the page and we should be in.

13
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,080
They know.

14
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,080
What?

15
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,080
They know we're on a proxy.

16
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,080
Try another server.

17
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,080
There isn't one.

18
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,080
Are you sure?

19
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,080
There's nothing.

20
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,080
60 seconds left.

21
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,080
60 seconds, Gabe.

22
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:57,080
All right, we're going to need to try something else here.

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Have you tried Surfshark?

24
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Surfshark?

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Surfshark?

26
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Yes.

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,120
You've got the link now.

28
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,120
It's downloading.

29
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,120
What is it?

30
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,120
It's a VPN service.

31
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:11,080
When things are geo-blocked right now, we can circumvent it.

32
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:14,160
We can virtually appear like we are in any one of a hundred countries.

33
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:17,640
If a Netflix show isn't available in your region, just change your location.

34
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,100
And it encrypts your traffic.

35
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:22,360
Your internet service provider can't see what you've been up to online.

36
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,960
And Surfshark doesn't keep logs of what you're doing either.

37
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,960
I've got it.

38
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,840
Open it.

39
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:29,840
Type Boston.

40
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,840
Hit connect.

41
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,840
That's all I have to do?

42
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,840
Just hit connect?

43
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:33,840
It's that simple?

44
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,480
It really is that simple.

45
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,480
This doesn't work.

46
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:42,800
We are out of time.

47
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,440
It's still blocked.

48
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,760
They have over 3200 different servers.

49
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,760
Connect to a different one.

50
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:01,760
Did we get it?

51
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,760
We got it.

52
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:13,440
If you use Code Opinion or click the link in the description box, you can get an extra

53
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,760
three months of Surfshark for free.

54
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:37,760
2017.

55
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,760
So that first story we're going to talk about today is about a family that has garnered

56
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,760
a lot of negative attention in the past week.

57
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,760
2017 was an interesting year on YouTube.

58
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:51,760
You poured molten lava on a phone and a cockroach.

59
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,760
A year of evolution, restlessness, and scandal.

60
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:03,760
Hello, I wanted to make a statement on what I said in my previous livestream.

61
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,360
The platform reached new heights, but there were many lows.

62
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,760
The website's ecosystem was irreparably changed, and creators were forced to adapt to it.

63
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:16,560
A bunch of advertisers, fearing backlash, removed their ads entirely from YouTube, and

64
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,760
during this period, every YouTuber saw a decrease in revenue.

65
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,760
Yet, amongst this all, the year mostly belonged to a creator by the name of Jake Paul, and

66
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,760
his motley crew of vagabonds known as Team 10, who had burst onto the scene with all

67
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,760
the bombast of the showbiz world's most notorious figures.

68
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,760
The colossal rise of Team 10 was attributed to a combination of pranks, music videos,

69
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,760
and controversies that all drew attention, criticism, and even anger from fellow content

70
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,760
creators and the general public alike, barely taking them a month to go from just another

71
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,760
YouTube ensemble to public enemy number one.

72
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,760
They continued to participate in escalating antics that would redefine content on YouTube

73
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,760
as many perceived at the time, cementing their status as YouTube royalty, for better and

74
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,760
for worse.

75
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,760
Fast forward a few years, and their YouTube channel is gone, many of their videos are

76
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,760
gone, and their presence online is left behind little more than a brief summary on their

77
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,760
website, and the commitment that a new era is coming soon.

78
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:21,760
They're carved out on the platform, lost.

79
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:25,760
Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of

80
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:29,760
a twat with too much free time, and Team 10, what happened

81
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:33,760
to them? Let's find out.

82
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:51,760
As I'm sure you're aware, we all know who Team 10

83
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:55,760
started with. However,

84
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:59,760
the origin story is somewhat more intriguing than one might assume it was, because before

85
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:03,760
Team 10 burst onto the scene, Jake Paul was a relatively popular teen actor and influencer,

86
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:07,760
posting with his brother Logan, don't know if you've heard of him, on Vine. They garnered

87
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:11,760
a multi-million following from posting short clips that capitalised on pantomime humour

88
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:15,760
in the mid-2010s. The content obviously hasn't dated particularly well,

89
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:22,760
but for what it's worth,

90
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:26,760
Logan and Jake were strong physical actors who could manipulate their bodies pretty successfully

91
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:30,760
to enable effective slapstick comedy. Now, Vine didn't last too long,

92
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:34,760
but the dreams that Jake Paul possessed persisted, and not too long after, he moved to LA

93
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:38,760
in pursuit of a greater goal, celebrity stardom. This appeared to be materialising

94
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:42,760
as soon as he acquired a role on the Disney Channel show Bizaardvark, alongside

95
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:46,760
Madison Hu and Olivia Rodrigo. Jake Paul played the role of a character who would partake

96
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:50,760
in a variety of days for social media clout, which was touted by Disney as an appropriate role

97
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:54,760
for such a creator. The show revolved around the concept of reality online, which was fitting

98
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:58,760
given that at the time Jake Paul was working on his own YouTube projects.

99
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:02,760
This included a channel called Jake Paul Productions, which appeared to alternate between

100
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:06,760
the genres of vlogging, comedy, and music. It had been running since May 2014,

101
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:11,760
and it accumulated a few hundred thousand subscribers by the time Jake's big Disney break came around.

102
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:15,760
However, not satisfied with a career in acting and a relatively fruitful YouTube channel,

103
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:19,760
something was brewing behind the scenes, a little project that Jake had been working on

104
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:24,760
with a few of his buddies, a syndicate known as Team 10. Team 10 had clearly been an idea

105
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:28,760
conceived by Paul as he was moving to Los Angeles. The Twitter appeared in September 2015

106
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:32,760
and the official website not too long after. In its formative era, there wasn't too much known

107
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:36,760
about its ethos or its aims, as its members were still not a major presence online.

108
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:40,760
However, this would gradually change over the following year as they worked to expand their influence.

109
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:45,760
Team 10's YouTube channel was launched around May 2016, a couple days before his two-year

110
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:49,760
upload anniversary on the video sharing platform. Although they were establishing a YouTube

111
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:53,760
presence, their marketing clearly presented something else, that this was an agency looking to

112
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:57,760
maximise the potential of future influencers. The advertising heralded it as the first ever

113
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:02,760
social media for the talent, by the talent. And although channel syndicates and collaborative

114
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:06,760
groups had existed long before Team 10, there was an air of formality about this arrangement

115
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:10,760
that appeared to set these creators apart. Being part of Team 10 granted you immediate benefits.

116
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:14,760
First of all, you'd have a slot on the Team 10 social medias, you'd be listed on their running

117
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:18,760
Twitter feed, you'd have access to uploading on their YouTube channel, and you'd likely be in the

118
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:22,760
proximity of the then up-and-coming Jake Paul, who was quickly becoming an overnight sensation,

119
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:26,760
and would regularly invite other members of the team onto his main channel. Most impressively

120
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:31,760
though, you'd have a spot in the Team 10 house, a sizable mansion which boasted a basketball hoop

121
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:35,760
in the kitchen and its own DJ booth. It seems that at its inception, Team 10 was going for a slightly

122
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:40,760
more diverse assemblage of talent. The early roster featured a young AJ Mitchell who would go on

123
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:44,760
to find considerable success as a solo musician, Alex Lang who would go on to find work as an actor,

124
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:49,760
and Nils Visser who was an aspiring DJ at the time. However, in spite of the marketing of Team 10

125
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:53,760
as a network to bolster individual success, there was a much greater motive that would become very

126
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:57,760
apparent if you read any of their blog posts from this time. We'll focus on this little excerpt,

127
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:02,760
that describes their new crib. After listing out all the cool aspects of the Team 10 house,

128
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:05,760
they share one additional detail, that quote,

129
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:28,760
Of course, this isn't a great revelation, nor is it some grand deception, but it is a tactic that reveals

130
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:33,760
what Jake's true intent with Team 10 was, and how it was capable of doing something that he alone

131
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:38,760
could not, and that was to capitalise on the fandom. You can have a teen idol who will be loved by

132
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:42,760
swathes of adoring fans, but put them in a group, and you have a dynamic that allows audiences to pick

133
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:46,760
favourites, play characters off each other, and be invested in the interweaving storylines that existed

134
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:51,760
in their lives. By then it was pretty clear that Jake Paul knew his appeal to younger teen audiences,

135
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,760
and if you didn't think he was explicit enough with his intentions, then you didn't have to look beyond

136
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:00,760
the interviews he gave for a more direct explanation of where his goals lay. As you get more and more popular

137
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:05,760
and start to build a brand name for yourself in the space, you start working with big Fortune 500 companies,

138
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,760
merchandising deals, you can tour, there are lots of ways to monetise, but if you have millions of fans,

139
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:14,760
and you can convert even 5% of them to pay for something of yours, you are in the 7 figure range.

140
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:19,760
Jake Paul was doing what a lot of corporate and record label executives had done before, he was manufacturing

141
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,760
Teen Appeal, but whereas many of those who had come before worked within the bounds that corporations

142
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:28,760
granted them, Jake seemed much more involved in the brand image than the teen idols who had come before him,

143
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:33,760
and possessed no shame in doing so. Jake Paul crafted a very polarised marketing strategy, on one hand

144
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:38,760
he placed himself as the nexus of youth stardom, priming a parasocial relationship with audiences who

145
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:43,760
wanted to feel like they were a part of his life, but conversely also playing to the crowd of entrepreneurs

146
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:48,760
who wanted a taste of that lifestyle. In another interview with Entertainment Tonight, Paul branded himself

147
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:54,760
in that he wanted to not just be a creator himself, but he wanted to raise the next generation of influencers,

148
00:09:54,760 --> 00:10:00,760
and that's what Team 10 represented to him, sowing the seeds of talent and reaping the rewards when they came to fruition.

149
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:04,760
However, although he had amassed a decent number of subscribers on their YouTube channels, and was building

150
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:10,760
a substantial relationship with audiences, it was hard to say that Jake Paul or Team 10 had quite made the big leagues yet,

151
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:14,760
there was still a formula waiting to be perfected, but if they wanted to do that, they would have to continue

152
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:19,760
pushing the boundaries of their content into new realms. How would they manage?

153
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,760
Well.

154
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:35,760
Although 2016 marked the online establishment of Team 10, 2017 was definitely the year it began to take off,

155
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,760
particularly on Jake Paul's main channel which featured many of the members and the shenanigans that occurred

156
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,760
in the four walls of the Squads Humbler boat.

157
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:52,760
Paul obviously had a penchant for doing it large, the sort of formula that Mr Beast refined in recent years,

158
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:57,760
of investing a lot to make a lot. This often led to rather high-budget stunts, pranks, and trips that would regularly

159
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:02,760
capture the imagination of prospective audiences. His actions were presented in the light of a brash frat boy

160
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:07,760
who was living it up, pushing the envelope to the extreme. However, unlike the platform's now largest individual creator,

161
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:12,760
the younger Paul brother also integrated elements of Team 10's personal lives into the content, and this formed

162
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:17,760
a more sequential narrative within the uploads. Even though these videos would work as standalone clip baiting content,

163
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,760
you could easily be drawn into the interpersonal relationships that these creators would have between each other,

164
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:27,760
and Jake would regularly alternate between silly and serious, even if it was just through whether he used up or lower case

165
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:32,760
in the titles, or punctuation marks like ellipses. There was an emotion that would be elicited from a user,

166
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:37,760
like excitement or fear. There was drama, drama that we'll talk about in a bit, but even when it seemed negative,

167
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:42,760
it served some sort of purpose in appearing real to those who watched it. Jake Paul knew exactly how he wanted

168
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:47,760
a video to be marketed, and the daily vlogging style allowed for a constant schedule that made the most of an algorithm

169
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:52,760
that often rewarded a strong upload schedule. This position Jake Paul's channel in particular is one of the fastest growing channels

170
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:57,760
on the platform, however many of his Team 10 colleagues also experienced unprecedented prosperity, especially Erica

171
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:02,760
Costell, the then girlfriend of Paul, whose romantic involvement with Jake was one of the centrepieces of the channel,

172
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:07,760
and would regularly be used as a selling point for a variety of commodities. All of these demonstrated the components

173
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:12,760
of the very successful channel that Jake had spoken about in interviews, one that progressed with its viewership's investment

174
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:17,760
in it. They had a loyal following from their fandom, but it also felt they had yet to become the colossus that Jake likely

175
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:22,760
envisioned during the conception of the channel. Not that many people were speaking about their content outside their audience,

176
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:27,760
and there was probably a question about where they would hit that ceiling, but that was about to change.

177
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:33,760
2017 was not just an interesting year in general, but an interesting year for music.

178
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:44,760
Particularly on YouTube, we're just seeing a rise in popularity for creator-performed diss tracks, most famously

179
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:49,760
by the likes of creators like RiceGum. The popularity of general rap music on YouTube had been bolstered by the fact

180
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:54,760
that reaction content in the musical domain was often oriented towards hip-hop, which seemed to inspire creators

181
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:59,760
to chance their own arm. These diss tracks were not particularly exceptional, but they were a goofy source of entertainment,

182
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:05,760
and a new spin on the then pretty exhaustive reaction commentary genre as a whole. However, no creator had properly made

183
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:10,760
an actual diss track to the rest of YouTube, and why would they? It would be an incredibly braggadocious thing for any creator

184
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:16,760
to do, and you could easily end up alienating your audience by insulting them. After all, they are part of the YouTube

185
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:24,760
network as much as anyone. You'd have to have confidence-bordering arrogance to do it, and well, one man, or one team, did.

186
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:32,760
Now, brag rappers long existed in the music industry, as a matter of fact, its existence underpins many modern

187
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:38,760
cornerstones of hip-hop music. However, brag rap worked because the brags were either impressive, challenging, or amusing,

188
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:43,760
and the artists actually had the charisma to back up what they were saying. Jake Paul, on the other hand, does not.

189
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:48,760
He had attempted a diss track against Ricegum in 2016, which was no better, but you'd think he would have learned something

190
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,760
in the year since, but alas.

191
00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:00,760
There is this degree of ineptitude that is almost fascinating when watching the music video. It exhibits a near elementary

192
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:05,760
understanding of how rhyming and wordplay operates within music, the number of couplets that just fall flat on their face,

193
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:11,760
the similes that are so basic they feel like they were written by someone with the talent of a grapefruit. They have a team of people,

194
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:18,760
this is the best they could come up with. There were so many inconceivable moments, Jake Paul's merch selling like a God Church,

195
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:24,760
Nick Crompton hailing from the city of England, and using the word litting, unironically. It was pure, unadulterated trash,

196
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,760
and everyone knew.

197
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:36,760
The thing about virally bad music is that it often has the potential to be more successful than virally good music.

198
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:42,760
This started all the way back in 2010 with Justin Bieber's Baby, which for a long time was the most disliked video on YouTube,

199
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:47,760
and persisted over the years with songs like Friday. Whereas in the case of Rebecca Black and Justin Bieber, there was a sense

200
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:52,760
that they were trying to perform a musical number, Jake Paul and his colleagues possessed none of that, especially given the subject

201
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:58,760
of their rap song was how much better they were than all of you. Accordingly, they were afforded even less charity by the

202
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:04,760
already savage internet dwellers who wasted no time in going at Team 10's attempts to establish themselves online.

203
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:10,760
I heard it in one day, they came out with that. I'm not saying it's easy to write music at all, I know it's tough,

204
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,760
but I think I could come up with a better song in one day.

205
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:18,760
The criticism came thick and fast, with many people pointing out the obvious, that Jake Paul was a subpar rapper,

206
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:24,760
and with such a popular and easy target, it wasn't long before even the platform's largest creators were chiming in on the platform's

207
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,760
personality.

208
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:30,760
I think this song has killed me. I wanna die more than I've ever died before.

209
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:37,760
Jake Paul was right in one sense, the PewDiePie was indeed next, and in doing that, Team 10 did what they were probably

210
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:40,760
setting out to do, establishing themselves.

211
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:58,760
Now, why did I include this part when I'm talking about the demise? Well, I think it very aptly describes Jake Paul's

212
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:03,760
relationship with Team 10. Jake Paul, on one hand, seemed like a very financially astute individual.

213
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:10,760
Um, yeah, so we're in a company called Teamdom, you can think of it as a modern day media conglomerate,

214
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:20,760
where we use social media and content marketing to drive products, talent, make viral videos, and we work with brands,

215
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,760
and develop products, and that sort of stuff, yeah.

216
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,760
On the other hand, he wrote this.

217
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:31,760
Now, there isn't a direct overlap between business acumen and songwriting capability, but it wouldn't have been

218
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:35,760
hard for him to hire a ghostwriter who probably would have assisted him with some pretty fire bars.

219
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:40,760
There was very little stopping Jake from writing a perfectly serviceable song, but he ultimately chose not to,

220
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:45,760
and he was also heavily involved in writing other people's verses as well, which seems strange given that they all

221
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:49,760
have talent in the musical vicinity, at least on par with their wringling.

222
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:53,760
The truth was that Jake assumed he knew better than everyone else, and maybe he did.

223
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:57,760
Jake Paul knew that the most easily exploited market was a younger child with an internet connection,

224
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:01,760
and an interest in modern culture and glamorous lifestyles, people who want to live like them,

225
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:06,760
so why wouldn't he produce content that is intentionally juvenile in its presentation, yet confident in its messaging?

226
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:10,760
It's the easiest way to tell a young person that, this is how you live like me.

227
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:14,760
If anything, It's Everyday Bro was a statement of transparency to everyone else online,

228
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:18,760
they were going to make a shit ton of money off their viewers, and there was nothing you could do about it.

229
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:25,760
Barely days after people started responding to his video, he dropped God Church merch that probably did sell like a God Church.

230
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,760
Despite his atrociousness, It's Everyday Bro quickly accumulated over 100 million views on YouTube,

231
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:34,760
charted in multiple countries, and ascended to number 3 in the weekly American iTunes chart.

232
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:39,760
Everyone was talking about Team 10, and nearly every member experienced exponential growth during this period,

233
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,760
many of whom appearing on the list of YouTube's fastest growing channels.

234
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:47,760
Commentators could say whatever they wanted, but it did not change the reality that Team 10 had arrived.

235
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,760
The question is though, what do you do now all eyes are on you?

236
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,760
My older brother, Logan Paul, probably never heard of him. He basically, um...

237
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,760
dissed, if you could even call us that, in his YouTube video.

238
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:01,760
He dissed, he dissed, It's Everyday Bro, the song, badly.

239
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,760
Let's talk about the concept of beef.

240
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:07,760
By now it was pretty clear that Team 10 were not in many people's good books,

241
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,760
but it wasn't necessarily bad for business, particularly given there was potential for conflict between groups.

242
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,760
Now, most of these people are not the most relevant to today's discourse,

243
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:18,760
and to be frank, a lot of the drama after the song's popularity was pretty manufactured,

244
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:21,760
including Jake's short-lived beef with his brother and the pop group Why Don't We,

245
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,760
but there was something brewing beneath the surface.

246
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:29,760
At the end of Logan's rather short response, you see, there is the apparent reveal of someone who is known to Jake.

247
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,760
Who is that person?

248
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,760
Anyway, there was this tribal element about It's Everyday Bro,

249
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,760
and it's relationship to Team 10, a sort of chest-beating moment.

250
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:56,760
And I say it's a diss to the whole of YouTube, and it is, but it was also a diss to a variety of people.

251
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:01,760
Nevertheless, there is what many assume to be a very real reference to a person by the name of Alyssa Violet,

252
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,760
and the relationship that she had with Team 10.

253
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:07,760
Let's go back to 2016 briefly, when Team 10 was still in its infancy.

254
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:12,760
As noted, there were a fair few members who were in and out of the house before a solid roster was assembled,

255
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:15,760
but none that were likely closer to Jake than Alyssa herself.

256
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:24,760
Alyssa and Jake went back, and I mean back in this sense, actually back to Jake Paul's home state of Ohio.

257
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:28,760
They met at 18, both fresh out of high school, when Jake moved to LA, as did Alyssa,

258
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,760
signing a five-year contract with Team 10.

259
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:33,760
And at first, real rumours swirled about her and Jake's romantic potential,

260
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:39,760
with many speculating on their relationship status, and Team 10 even marketing merchandise related to the couple's connection.

261
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:44,760
However, at the start of 2017, this soured when Alyssa was abruptly removed from the Team 10 group,

262
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,760
with Jake releasing a distraught statement alleging that she cheated on him.

263
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:53,760
Alyssa adamantly denied this, and put out her own statement saying that she couldn't have cheated because they were never a legitimate couple,

264
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,760
expressing a sentiment of betrayal that he couldn't even make such claims.

265
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:02,760
One thing was for certain though, it concluded the will they, won't they saga, with a rather definite they won't.

266
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:07,760
This tension persisted over the following months, with Hollywood Gossip Magazines continuing to cover the story.

267
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:13,760
However, It's Everyday Bro, and the lyrics relating to what was sent at 4.52, once more placed this breakup underneath the spotlight

268
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,760
as they appeared to be an indirect reference to their breakup.

269
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:21,760
At this point, Team 10 were rather widely hated by the online world for their godawful music,

270
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:25,760
but Alyssa was about to give them one more reason, or a few more at least.

271
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:30,760
Alyssa- I just don't understand how someone could do that to someone. I really don't.

272
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:35,760
On the 9th of June, Alyssa Viola uploaded a video entitled, What You've Been Waiting For.

273
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:40,760
This video is a much more personal dissertation on her relationship with Jake, expressing that she legitimately loved him,

274
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:45,760
and that she experienced serious emotional turmoil due to the fact that he regularly played with her expectations,

275
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,760
including asking her to leave the bedroom so he could sleep with other girls.

276
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:54,760
Alyssa- I'd move in with him, sleeping in the same bed, basically together at this point, but without a title.

277
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:58,760
But then he would always have girls over in front of me, and I was just like, what the frick?

278
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:02,760
So then we're not together. But then he would play all these mind games with me and just be like, yo, don't get mad,

279
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:09,760
having a girl over. Can you do that 25,000 times? I would be in our room editing or doing something,

280
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:15,760
and then all of a sudden he'd walk in and be like, yo, can you leave, please, for two hours? Can you go upstairs?

281
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:19,760
Can you leave for a little bit? And I was like, why? He was like, oh, I'm having a girl over.

282
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:23,760
We're gonna hang out in here. Okay. It was heartbroken. Legit heartbroken.

283
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:27,760
This was a significant detail in the video, given that some of Team 10's most successful uploads at that point

284
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:31,760
were content that clickbaited the speculative aspect of Jake and Alyssa's relationship.

285
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:36,760
In essence, she felt used for content, and then cast aside when she wouldn't play Jake Paul's game.

286
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:42,760
I finally treated him the way that he was treating me, and he didn't like it. He got pissed and kicked me out.

287
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:49,760
Like, the one time I decided to be savage like him, and it ended with me being homeless.

288
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:54,760
Although a footnote in a lengthy rebuke to Jake Paul, it seemed to illuminate the idea that Team 10 was living

289
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:58,760
a much more manufactured lifestyle, the one that was portrayed over YouTube.

290
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:03,760
The video as a whole reflected the sort of control that Jake also exerted over people who were bound to him,

291
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:07,760
metaphorically and contractually, but it wasn't over yet.

292
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,760
At the end of the day, you can't just say I'm sorry and take everything back.

293
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:25,760
I'm hurt still, and you've hurt a lot of people. The damage is already done.

294
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:29,760
You can't just kill someone and bring them back to life. It doesn't work like that in the real world.

295
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:35,760
And I know a lot of you will be like, Alyssa, don't release that track like you're such a b****. Be the bigger person.

296
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:40,760
No, I'm sorry, guys. I've been wanting to make this video for so long now. I'm very honest.

297
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:43,760
If I got a boob job, I would tell you guys I got a boob job.

298
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:49,760
Rice and I have been working on the song, and we put our blood, sweat, and tears into this, and I'm proud of it. I want to put it out there.

299
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:54,760
Alyssa Violet's video is a bit strange in the sense that the first 14 minutes contain a lot of seemingly sincere criticism

300
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:58,760
of Jake Paul and the Team 10 dynamic. However, she concludes the video with the promise of a diss rap of her own,

301
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:02,760
a collaboration with then extremely popular creator and YouTube rapper RiceGum.

302
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:07,760
She announced a final verse and music video would be dropping in a few days, but releases a majority of the lyrical content

303
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:12,760
for the viewers to enjoy. This seemed like a strange contrast to the rest of the video, and felt more like an indulgence

304
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:15,760
to the performative content that Team 10 had been participating in.

305
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:20,760
Barely a day after, Jake Paul had released a response to Alyssa Violet's video where he had mostly been

306
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:24,760
invasive of divulging any intimate information, dancing around subjects as a whole.

307
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:29,760
He also recorded this alongside a monologue where he talks about decreasing online hate and being kinder to each other,

308
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:34,760
a complete coincidence I'm sure. However, he said regardless of what came next, he would not be responding

309
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:39,760
as he didn't want to deal with the drama publicly, likely aware that any engagement could bring the rest of his crew

310
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:43,760
into the drama, and the possible questions it could attract about the nature of Team 10 itself.

311
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:48,760
On the 11th of June, the song and music video for RiceGum and Alyssa Violet's diss track, It's Every Night Sis,

312
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:53,760
dropped on Rice's YouTube channel, and, well, the least I can say is that it was better than it's everyday bro.

313
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:05,760
The flow in the bars were a stark improvement on Team 10's offering, although by lyrical standards it still left a lot to be desired,

314
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:10,760
with a lot of thematic repetition and couplets that didn't quite rhyme as well as they probably could.

315
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:15,760
However, it was definitely designed to be a more personal attack as they harp on Jake Paul's high school history,

316
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:19,760
which had been portrayed by some ex-students as being mired by ruffian and bully boy behaviour.

317
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:29,760
Following this, a lot of people took the side of Alyssa, with many criticising Jake harshly in his comments section.

318
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:34,760
However, the aspect of this once more being projected onto a YouTube diss rap tended to reinforce the facade

319
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:39,760
of Team 10 rather than actually undermining it. Jake Paul operated over the medium of performance,

320
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:44,760
and ultimately regardless of what you said over a music video, it was only going to more deeply invest people

321
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:50,760
than actually rip the mask off, which is what Alyssa appeared to be trying to do throughout the majority of her initial upload.

322
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:55,760
I don't know how I could love a person that treats someone like that. I don't know if I was in love with him,

323
00:24:55,760 --> 00:25:04,760
or the idea of him, or who I thought he was. I think I was just addicted to the pain of wanting someone so unattainable.

324
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:09,760
Ultimately, in spite of the massive view count this drama generated, and testimony from a believable source,

325
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:14,760
Team 10 remained largely unscathed, and continued to pump out content on a daily basis.

326
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:18,760
Although Alyssa's video walked the line of tearing down the pretense of Team 10's content,

327
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:24,760
it only stopped short of doing so, and instead of looking at this video of how Jake had used a person to create a reality

328
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:29,760
for their channel, they tended to look at it from the context of how Jake had treated a former member of Team 10.

329
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:33,760
What their image was at that time didn't matter, as long as they had the tools to pull it off,

330
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:38,760
and in the coming month it became clear that there was to be an embrace of the villainous status that had been bestowed

331
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:43,760
onto them by their critics. This meant more emotional, serious videos, more content addressing their own friendships

332
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:48,760
and relationships, and more pranks and stunts that promised even higher stakes than the last.

333
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:53,760
Eventually, the scope of what Team 10 were aspiring for in their little fantasy world began to have implications

334
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,760
for the rest of planet Earth.

335
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:55,760
I'm cramping!

336
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,760
Yo, I don't know who won.

337
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,760
I need help, Chance!

338
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,760
You gotta hand me!

339
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,760
I don't know, bro, we need to fix it!

340
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:01,760
We need to replay!

341
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,760
Cut it! Call for it! Call for it!

342
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,760
Replay!

343
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:09,760
As you're likely aware, Team 10 had a house. Unlike many houses, it was in a neighbourhood, which unsurprisingly,

344
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:16,760
was not full of young people looking to party, and as Team 10's antics gradually escalated, so did the negative aspect

345
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:21,760
of those in the real world. In the month following, their house hosted a multitude of stunts that generated multiple

346
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:26,760
complaints about his behaviour, as many online maligned him, Team 10 seemed to lean into its status,

347
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:31,760
with Jake being the main spokesperson for them, continuing to be a nuisance even when other people in the real world

348
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,760
tried to consult him about it.

349
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:37,760
Jake, I wouldn't do that. I wouldn't crawl up there.

350
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,760
Why?

351
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:39,760
I just wouldn't do that.

352
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,760
A lot of the neighbours are complaining, they're very upset.

353
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:43,760
No, why?

354
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:49,760
They say that you've created a living hell out here, that it's like a circus.

355
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:50,760
Yeah, it is.

356
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:51,760
All the fans.

357
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,760
I mean, but people like going to circuses, right?

358
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:57,760
Interviews with the mainstream media had gone from these relaxed dialogues to borderline bedlam.

359
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:01,760
Drama that had previously been contained within the YouTube platform was spilling over in all directions,

360
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:05,760
and everyone continued to amplify its coverage over the entirety of social media.

361
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:10,760
Team 10 obviously enjoyed continued strong viewership over this period, however, there were real world

362
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:15,760
consequences for this publicity, the most notable being Disney's decision to sever ties with Jake Paul,

363
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:21,760
ending his work on Bizaardvark, further enshrining this image as this out of control celebrity with a gang of hooligans.

364
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:28,760
He's just going around like a wrecking ball, being an absolute douchebag to people in public,

365
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:35,760
and everything that he does, he's just like this fucking ego-brained, just has no perception of what it's like

366
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:39,760
to be a respectful, decent human being in society.

367
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:45,760
And, you know, Jake Paulers would call that savage, you know, dab on those motherfucking haters,

368
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,760
I call it being a fucking loser.

369
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,760
That's just how I was raised.

370
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:55,760
Jake Paul said there wouldn't be a response to Alyssa Violet, but in a way, the heightened stunts and the consequences

371
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:58,760
that resulted from Team 10's involvement in them were just that.

372
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:02,760
It was a statement of legitimacy that sought to invalidate the criticism that Team 10 were just another

373
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:08,760
flash in the pan collective coasting off their 15 minutes of fame, but could they ever fully avert that?

374
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:14,760
Not everything that you see in the media on a day-to-day basis is real, and that you could basically fake anything

375
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:17,760
and twist everything the way you want.

376
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:23,760
Understanding what made Team 10 tick requires an understanding of the actual power dynamics between Jake

377
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:28,760
and the rest of the crew members. By that should have been apparent, the Team 10 didn't exist because they were all besties.

378
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:33,760
This was a business venture, and led at the helm by an intrepid influencer who was willing to put everything at stake

379
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:38,760
for the success of it. Jake Paul had outwardly stated his intent multiple times to create a network which would

380
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:43,760
maintain a hierarchy of younger talent beneath him, and at the time Team 10 appeared to be a model that would

381
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,760
optimise that. However, were the cracks starting to show?

382
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:50,760
As aforementioned, there are many benefits to working within a group, particularly when curating fandoms

383
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:54,760
who want to see personalities building off each other, the monetisation of such networks is incredibly

384
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:59,760
lucrative for all those involved. This income is typically a motivator to keep these sets of people together,

385
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:04,760
but at the same time, if a collective becomes too popular, then individual members may feel that it is in their best interest

386
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:09,760
to go solo. Jake Paul had to walk a tightrope of making Team 10 famous enough to be a worthy investment,

387
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:14,760
but also reliant on him for that fame to the extent that people wouldn't just walk out. The members themselves

388
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:19,760
would have felt empowered by the success of Team 10, but also somewhat hesitant to change the status quo,

389
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:24,760
out of fear that their prosperity may not carry over into their solo ventures, and who can blame them given the many

390
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,760
techniques that Jake himself employed.

391
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:54,760
Although he obviously wanted the presence of Team 10 for his many antics, in interviews he would still be quite

392
00:29:54,760 --> 00:30:00,760
possessive over the fandom, even when surrounded by his peers, you'd hear the term Jake Paulers rather than Team Teners.

393
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:06,760
Now, the former does roll off the tongue better, but that's not the reason why he uses the term, in this case it's all about

394
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:11,760
control. It's the same reason he used his main personal channel to upload a significant amount of Team 10 content,

395
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:17,760
he wanted to conflate the success of Team 10 with his own, so there was a sense of dependency on Jake.

396
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:22,760
He didn't want people to just join, acquire success, and leave, but now as someone who did just that, and being

397
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:28,760
noticeably vocal about it, there was a sense that maybe this structure that Paul had set up was looking somewhat fragile.

398
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:33,760
Although simultaneously being the public and private face of a business may have seemed like an advantageous position

399
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:38,760
at the start of Team 10, as it enabled a close relationship with the public perception, it also eventually made him

400
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:43,760
quite vulnerable, particularly when he became infamous amongst online communities, and it became beneficial for people

401
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:48,760
to talk shit about him. There are many managers in the industry who are real disciplinarians, for many it's seen as a

402
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:54,760
standard for them to maintain a public image, I'm sure there are some who are quite unpopular for it, but for Jake,

403
00:30:54,760 --> 00:31:00,760
when his public image was skewered, so was his private enterprise, influencers are far less likely to go on record and

404
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:04,760
complain about a corporate executive. Jake Paul on the other hand was a prime target.

405
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:09,760
By making a video on the matter and the subsequent diss track with RiceGum, Alyssa Violet seems to set a precedent for the

406
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:16,760
attention that could be generated just by leaving, and aligning herself with those who may be hostile to Team 10 and Jake Paul.

407
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:21,760
At the same time, she also had reduced the novelty of such an action, and actually appeared to possess legitimate

408
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:26,760
justification for it, so even though there may be some who seem tempted to walk away, Jake's newfound commitment

409
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:31,760
to the image of Team 10 may have won them over for the moment, but how much could Jake do to convince them that

410
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:32,760
they were better together?

411
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:42,760
Well let's talk about loyalty, it's clearly a trait that Jake Paul values in a team member, provided that the loyalty

412
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:47,760
is to him and not from him. Generally, that was presented as the reason that Alyssa Violet had been ejected from

413
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:52,760
the house in the first place. Come August, it appeared she had properly moved on from Team 10, and had entered into a

414
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:57,760
relationship with the content creator FaZe Banks, who was also heavily enshrined in the Los Angeles scene.

415
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:02,760
Despite supposedly referring to her in It's Everyday Bro, Jake has since made a point of not addressing her,

416
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:08,760
leading with a peace and love philosophy that was always evident in his content. On August 18th, he put out a post

417
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:13,760
on his Twitter, appearing to show remorse for his actions over the past few months. He stated that he had learned

418
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:18,760
that words could indeed be very powerful, and that he would be more mindful of his words going forward.

419
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:23,760
What was his reason for doing this? Was it a heavy issue weighing on his conscience?

420
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:24,760
Well.

421
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:35,760
Long story short of it is that Meg was assaulted by a man last night, who is in the same community and space as us.

422
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:40,760
And it's not like, if you guys see, she literally has a bruise, I don't know if you can see on camera, like here,

423
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:44,760
not to be like dramatic, but like she literally has a bruise on the side of the whole entire neck.

424
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:50,760
The same day, you see, Jake released a video titled, My Assistant Was Assaulted. A pretty serious accusation,

425
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:55,760
once again it was embedded in a standard vlog, so there's lots of typical shenanigans before this sobering sit down

426
00:32:55,760 --> 00:33:00,760
with the solemn faces and the still camera, where Jake discloses more details relating to this incident,

427
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,760
including the alleged perpetrator.

428
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:10,760
When I was leaving, he sort of clotheslined me and put their arm out in front of me, and tried to like pull me

429
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:16,760
into the place that they were, into his table. I was looking up at him and our faces were really close,

430
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,760
and he sort of like was right here.

431
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:23,760
I feel like it was more extreme. He didn't know you, doesn't know you.

432
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:28,760
I've never met him before, I just know who he is because he's well known in our same community.

433
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:32,760
In this video, Jake and his peers explain that during his assistant's outing to the club,

434
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:37,760
she'd spotted FaZe Banks making out with a girl who wasn't Alyssa, and then while on her way back from the bathroom,

435
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:42,760
she'd run into Banks who clotheslined her, leaving a very noticeable bruise on her neck.

436
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:47,760
The thing is though, it's not even internet beef. He doesn't even know who Meg is.

437
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,760
Meg is behind the scenes.

438
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:54,760
Literally, it just so happens that she is my assistant and works here.

439
00:33:54,760 --> 00:34:00,760
And so, what's crazy about this is that if it wasn't her, this message would have never been spread.

440
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:05,760
This type of thing could have kept on happening. It could have spiralled into a lot worse things.

441
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:09,760
It just sickens me, but I don't know if there's more to the story.

442
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:15,760
Jake quickly dismisses ideas that this has anything to do with Team 10's ongoing disputes with Banks and Alyssa,

443
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:19,760
stating there was no way that Banks could have even recognised his assistant to the club,

444
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,760
and that this could have happened to any female.

445
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:26,760
Jake Paul was just standing up for women all around the world.

446
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:31,760
This video isn't meant to retaliate or target anyone.

447
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:36,760
It's not about that. It's not about revenge or starting a drama or beef or anything.

448
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:42,760
It's about how important this message is to get out there, and we're trying to figure out the situation.

449
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,760
But what was he really doing?

450
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,760
This was a very serious charge being made about a public figure.

451
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:12,760
Nick DM'd the person, police are involved, there's proof, thankfully there's cameras at this club,

452
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:19,760
and we are going to stop this and have justice and let the police take it from here,

453
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:24,760
and they're the professionals, they can handle it, but overall this situation just sucks.

454
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:29,760
It was provided even more credibility by the fact that it had come from number one feminist Jake Paul.

455
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,760
Additionally, Nick Crompton tweeted a screenshot to substantiate this,

456
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:37,760
adding that the police had been informed that Team 10 would never, ever lie to their fans.

457
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,760
However, this statement would be brought into question by FaZe Banks himself,

458
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:43,760
who would soon post a video response the following day.

459
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:47,760
With the title My Girlfriend Was Assaulted, he elaborates on the screenshot that Nick Crompton had posted,

460
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,760
showing that there was missing context to the message.

461
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,760
He said to me somewhere along the lines of,

462
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:56,760
she said she knows you didn't do it on purpose, so she doesn't think you did it on purpose,

463
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:59,760
but my assistant was at Warwick last night, it's a club in LA,

464
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:03,760
and you were there as well, and she walked by your table, and you like clotheslined her,

465
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,760
or did something, and you left this bruise on her neck.

466
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:09,760
So right here, Nick has lost all credibility.

467
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:14,760
Now, of course, it's very possible that a person can reflect on an event and change their mind about an individual's intentions,

468
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:17,760
but with all the intersecting factors, including Jake's ongoing feud with Melissa,

469
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:22,760
and the rather ham-fisted narrative surrounding women's rights, and being more considerate in general,

470
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:28,760
it felt like this was another rather calculated move to vilify a person who was finding success outside of Jake's incubator project.

471
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:31,760
Additionally, given that it was completely separate to the allegation of the clothesline,

472
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:35,760
the detail of FaZe Banks supposedly making out with a woman who wasn't Alyssa,

473
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:39,760
seemed like a twist of the knife into a person who had not been loyal to their beloved team.

474
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:44,760
There was no real way to avoid the fact that this seemed much more personally motivated than it had been presented.

475
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:51,760
If there was genuine concern, why would you air out that information in a public forum before talking to the affected party first?

476
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,760
I never thought that anybody could lie about something like this.

477
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:58,760
So initially, I responded with, wait, what? Who is that? I've never seen this person ever.

478
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:04,760
I don't remember having any interaction with this person, and this is the first time I have ever seen this human being in my life,

479
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:07,760
and it's a picture of a bruise on her neck, and I'm being told that I caused the bruise.

480
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:12,760
So I responded, I said, oh my God, holy shit, I don't remember doing that.

481
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:19,760
I don't think, I never saw her, but obviously if I did do it, it was on accident, 100% on accident, and I'm sorry.

482
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:23,760
And I asked for her on Twitter, and I tried to get in touch with her, to which Nick didn't respond to any of that.

483
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:28,760
In Banks' video, he goes into more details about this incident, explaining that he had attempted to reconcile

484
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:33,760
nearly immediately, but was not given any route to do this. Banks also provided eyewitness testimony from two of his friends

485
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:39,760
who were also at the establishment that night, which were both very differing accounts to the one presented by Jake Paul in his video,

486
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:44,760
both of whom confirmed there was no way that he would have ever made out with another girl, and that any physical incident

487
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:48,760
with Jake Paul's assistant was completely unintentional, though he doubts whether it even happened now.

488
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:54,760
I suggest that it was a possibility that members of Team 10 had spiked his drinks in an attempt to engineer the situation.

489
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:58,760
I'm sitting there minding my own business, I'm speaking to Naija, which you've seen, you're talking to Naija.

490
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:04,760
I look over at Naija, and I look back behind me, and the kid, they have you up, and you're not even paying attention to who you're making eye contact to,

491
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:09,760
and you're drinking out of the thing, and they're like, keep, keep, keep, for the next five minutes, keep feeding you alcohol.

492
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,760
And they were trying to just get you.

493
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:12,760
They were trying to get you complete.

494
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:13,760
Kids from Team 10, by the way.

495
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,760
Blacked out.

496
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,760
These kids actually did something to me.

497
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:23,760
Like, I really truly, in my heart, believe that these kids drugged me, or just got me way beyond drunk,

498
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,760
and obviously with intent, they told you they were trying to get me blacked out.

499
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:32,760
As you're likely aware, the video didn't end there, and Banks and Alissa proceeded to go into more depth about the relationship with Jake and Alissa,

500
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:36,760
revealing details that even many neutral parties would label as abusive.

501
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:40,760
Honestly, he did assault me a few times.

502
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:46,760
If we never agreed on something, or if something happened, he would spit in my face, and this has happened multiple times.

503
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:49,760
He would, like, spit at, like, my feet, the ground that I walk on.

504
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,760
Another time, he threw my phone.

505
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:55,760
Neil's was there, too, at this one, too, and surprisingly enough, Alex Lane was there at this one, too.

506
00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:00,760
When I was living in his apartment, he took my phone, threw it at the wall, we got into a fight, I ran upstairs,

507
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:04,760
he dragged me down the f***ing stairs, and I actually have-

508
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,760
Yeah, that's been on your leg since I met you.

509
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:09,760
This has been here for, like, two f***ing years, dude.

510
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:14,760
Today's Banks concludes the response, stating that he will be suing Jake Paul and Team 10 for defamation of character.

511
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:18,760
In the coming days, there were further responses from all sides trying to shield their reputations,

512
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:22,760
including Logan as well, who sat down with his brother to go over their side of the story.

513
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:27,760
Eventually, Jake walked back his statements and expressed how he was actually all about positivity now,

514
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,760
and that this would be resolved in private.

515
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:35,760
...to handle the situation, and so I reached out to Banks directly, over text message, and we're communicating now,

516
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:40,760
and we are going to meet up, figure out how to solve this situation, we're stopping the drama, guys.

517
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:45,760
However, this was not the end for Banks, who decided to release another video titled Proof I'm Innocent.

518
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,760
This included an interview with a person by the name of Max Beaumont.

519
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:53,760
Max Beaumont was a member of Team 10 who had been speculated as the individual who may or may not have spiked

520
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:58,760
FaZe Banks' drink. However, amidst all the conjecture, he abruptly decided to leave the Team 10 house,

521
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:01,760
stating that he would be returning to college for a normal life.

522
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:06,760
After calling his departure, he sat down with FaZe Banks over a phone call to help clear up the events of the night.

523
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:10,760
Do you, as a person who has seen this all go down, as somebody who was there that night,

524
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:16,760
between me and you, everything that you've consumed about the situation thus far, do you believe that I did this?

525
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:20,760
I do not believe that you intentionally assaulted this girl.

526
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:25,760
I believe that, if anything, you accidentally bumped into her.

527
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:30,760
I can't explain the bruise, and she's my best friend for seven years, so it's so hard for me to say this,

528
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:36,760
but the way that I saw you that night, I do not see how it was a possibility that you went from this nice guy

529
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:40,760
who came over and gave me a hug to someone who started swinging at her afterwards.

530
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,760
That's my personal opinion.

531
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:45,760
And just one more thing, do you believe that I kissed somebody that night?

532
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,760
No.

533
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:49,760
He echoes Banks' retelling, stating that he did not see Banks cheat on anyone,

534
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:53,760
and that he also did not witness any physical incident occur with Jake Paul's assistant,

535
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:57,760
writing additional third-party testimony contradictory to that of Jake Paul and his crew.

536
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:00,760
Now, some probably said that he was trying to ease any tensions with Banks,

537
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,760
given that his name had been brought up in relation to the incident.

538
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:05,760
Declaring Banks' name was the best way to clear his own name.

539
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:08,760
At the same time, Beaumont was one of the founding members of the team,

540
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:13,760
he had been there for a very long time, and he seemed to lose a lot more from walking away from Team 10,

541
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:17,760
and repudiating the testimony of someone who he clearly considered to be a close friend.

542
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:21,760
Everyone knows how fleeting drama is online, and his name was only brought up in passing.

543
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:27,760
Hey man, I'm Max, I'm from Team 10, and his Instagram, it'll pop up right now, it's whoismax, right?

544
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:28,760
Whoismax, his name's whoismax.

545
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:32,760
This and the prior video did make a dent in the subscriber count of Paul and co,

546
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,760
with many siding against the infamous squad,

547
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:39,760
which is such a shock after Jake Paul was so determined to drop the issue and be all about peace and love.

548
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,760
We weren't handling the situation the right way.

549
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,760
But the truth is, it's not an issue of being positive.

550
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:47,760
If someone was assaulted, it would be quite a pressing matter,

551
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:50,760
and the police would be contacted if you felt it needed to be addressed.

552
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:53,760
It's an issue of honesty, and actually making sure that if an incident has occurred,

553
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:57,760
the facts are established so all relevant and proportionate action can be taken.

554
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:01,760
I don't think the video's existence was unjustified if Paul believed what he was saying,

555
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:05,760
but as the situation continued to transpire, and more details were revealed,

556
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,760
it became increasingly difficult to believe.

557
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,760
So what was the reason behind all of this?

558
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:14,760
We can assume it was personally motivated, but what would that personal motivation be?

559
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,760
I didn't really know whether or not it was him at first,

560
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:22,760
because he has a girlfriend, and he was making out with this other girl that I knew wasn't his girlfriend.

561
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:25,760
So at first I was confused, but then I realised it was definitely him.

562
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,760
Well, let's talk about it.

563
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,760
There are loads of self-interested reasons to start drama with a person.

564
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:41,760
Most of the time it doesn't happen because the cons of manufactured drama sufficiently outweigh the pros.

565
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,760
But in the case of Jake Paul, whether the allegations were true or false,

566
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:46,760
he had more than enough motive to stir the pot.

567
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:51,760
Part of it is factualism, Jake Paul's prime directive is to appeal to his audience and Team 10.

568
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:56,760
Outside the women's rights narrative, him speaking up makes it look like he is standing up for someone close to him.

569
00:42:56,760 --> 00:43:01,760
Not only is this demonstrative loyalty to the people in his life, but also for those who trust his intentions.

570
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:04,760
This is the most notable thing a guy can do for his friends and colleagues,

571
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:07,760
so on one hand he has demonstrated his allegiance to his team.

572
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:10,760
However, that wasn't the only reason, and I call back to the question I asked earlier.

573
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:16,760
Why would you include the detail of your ex's boyfriend cheating on her if it doesn't actually substantiate your initial allegation?

574
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:20,760
Sure, the clothesline incident was good motivation for a video addressing this issue at hand,

575
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:22,760
but I think there's one big reason that detail existed.

576
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:31,760
We call back to Jake's plans of creating a major creator network where he works as a quasi-mentor for many creators,

577
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:33,760
facilitating their success on YouTube.

578
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:37,760
It's not an uncommon position to aspire for, but I don't think he does it out of altruism.

579
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:43,760
For a person who likely gives himself a lot more credit than he should, he always expects something in return, that loyalty.

580
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:49,760
What looked like an act of loyalty for Team 10 was actually an attempted punishment of disloyalty to Alyssa Violet,

581
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:54,760
provoking an aspect of factualism to show that those who did leave Team 10 would not just be joining the enemy,

582
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:57,760
but an enemy that had actively sought to harm Jake and his friends.

583
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:02,760
That's a difficult position for any member of Team 10 to come to terms with, but now it is significantly backfired,

584
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:06,760
and there was a sense that this situation had been used for much more insidious reasons.

585
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:10,760
A member of Team 10 had walked out of the house, and their credibility was wearing thin.

586
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:14,760
On the surface, Jake may have been trying to show more loyalty and commitment to Team 10,

587
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:18,760
but the contrience of this drama could not masquerade itself behind the very apparent truth,

588
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:23,760
that Jake was playing Game of Thrones, and its schtick was beginning to tie.

589
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:26,760
Jake, what do you think about the It's Every Night Sis song?

590
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:27,760
What is it?

591
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:30,760
It's Every Night Sis with rice gum?

592
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:32,760
Oh, I think it's great, man.

593
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:39,760
I just claimed the views on it, I'm gonna buy a new car with it.

594
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:45,760
Jake's continued anger towards people who left Team 10, yet inability to change or prevent it would confuse many reasonable onlookers,

595
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:50,760
but unfortunately most of the people who actually cared enough to spectate were not in a reasonable frame of mind.

596
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:54,760
Over August and September, there was this sense once again that Jake Paul was trying to be real.

597
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:58,760
This began with a diss track to himself, which on the surface may have seemed like a legitimate self-reflection,

598
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:02,760
but more just included him presenting his own perspective on recent matters,

599
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:05,760
and once more taking passing shots of former members.

600
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:18,760
It began very hard to almost hide the fragility of one man,

601
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:24,760
and how his fame as an individual, Crater, and his greater aspirations were continuously compromised by the actions of others.

602
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:29,760
This is a man who had given these people everything, and yet time and time again people kept walking away,

603
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,760
despite the fact that he treated them like family.

604
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:34,760
And when reflecting on where many of the founding members were now,

605
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:38,760
there seemed to be this growing list of alumni who had just vanished from the crew's vlogs.

606
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:42,760
No big thank yous, no glorious send off, even the people who had supposedly left on amicable terms,

607
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:45,760
one day they were there, the next day they weren't.

608
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:50,760
Most of the time you'd find out from a video on their own channel, or if Jake Paul dropped a diss on them somewhere.

609
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:54,760
If Jake treated these people like family, I'd hate to see how he treated his family.

610
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:58,760
In a way, when someone left the house for good, Jake seemed too embarrassed to even admit that it happened.

611
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:04,760
Team 10 had to look like this indomitable frat house fortress to any outsider's sources, where the banter never ends.

612
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:08,760
He was also aware of how the media would latch onto an exit en masse,

613
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:13,760
how one person leaving could easily provoke copycat incidents, and how he had to do everything to prevent it.

614
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:19,760
However, he couldn't help letting his personal biases seep into the content because that's also how he maximised the potential of his personality.

615
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:24,760
Jake Paul was allowed to be weak, he was allowed to be human, that's what made him appeal to the viewers,

616
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:28,760
talking about peace and love and his own personal struggles and being a decent person,

617
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:33,760
but when Team 10 activities ensued, it could never truly fail, even when cars were smashed,

618
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:39,760
even when fires were sent,

619
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:45,760
even when members were injured.

620
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:04,760
It could not afford to fail, but in doing so, Jake Paul split his persona down the middle and created a recipe for disaster.

621
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:10,760
What do I mean? Well, not too long after the loss of founding member Max Beaumont, a more fiery exit would follow.

622
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:16,760
So, let's talk about two very curious characters, known as the Martinez Twins.

623
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:22,760
The Martinez Twins joined Team 10 in early 2017, appearing to serve as a proxy replacement to the Dolan Twins,

624
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:25,760
who some had speculated on Jake's relationship with after they had collaborated.

625
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:29,760
In many ways, given their unique background to the rest of the team and their brotherly camaraderie,

626
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:33,760
the Martinez Twins quickly became fan favourites in the hearts of many Jake Paulers.

627
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:39,760
They had this sort of wide-eyed innocence and energy that complemented the edgier presence of people like Jake and Piers,

628
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:43,760
more seasoned with these group antics. On the surface, they seemed to be living their dream,

629
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:47,760
but it did beckon one question, what happens when you're not in on the joke?

630
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:57,760
The Martinez Twins were sort of at the forefront of the new era of Team 10,

631
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:01,760
making a rather notable appearance on It's Everyday Bro, and spinning super hot fire lyrics.

632
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:05,760
They appeared to be a part and parcel of the team's pranks and japes, however, around September,

633
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:07,760
they began to act a little out of character.

634
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:17,760
First came a diss track that appeared to be directed at some of their comrades,

635
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:20,760
however, you could easily perceive that as a joke and move on.

636
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:23,760
Not too long after, in October though, they flew back to Spain,

637
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:27,760
and their future with Team 10 appeared uncertain while they struggled to obtain visas.

638
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:29,760
They were designed to return regardless at the start of November,

639
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:33,760
but accompanied by a video that revealed that they would not be residing in the Team 10 house anymore.

640
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:38,760
Many Team 10 fans seemed disappointed by this, expressing that they would be most welcome there,

641
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:41,760
but more perceptive viewers probably realised something was up,

642
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:45,760
and barely a week after came a further video that was posted on their channel titled,

643
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:46,760
We Left Jake Paul's Team.

644
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:50,760
On the surface, this video could have a plethora of interpretations,

645
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:53,760
by now, clickbait was so second nature to the genre of content,

646
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:56,760
that they could have just been going on a day trip to Disney without the rest of the crew.

647
00:48:56,760 --> 00:49:01,760
Once the video starts, you realise that this title actually does exactly what it says on the tin.

648
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:08,760
So, guys, we're no longer with Team 10.

649
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:13,760
In this unmonetised upload, they reveal that they have indeed departed the notorious posse,

650
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:15,760
but are seemingly vague about the details behind this.

651
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:19,760
With that said, from what one can gleam, the message of the video was that they had joined Team 10

652
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:23,760
under the pretense that it would be a very different experience to the one they subsequently received.

653
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:28,760
They felt that their naivety was taken advantage of by many of those in the team who found them an easy target to pick on,

654
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:30,760
deeply given how they were not fluent with their language.

655
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:33,760
However, as they became more familiar with the world in LA,

656
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:36,760
they became more disillusioned with what was offered to them.

657
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:40,760
And we went there, and it was like Team 10.

658
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:42,760
We didn't know about Team 10 before that.

659
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:45,760
We were like, yo, they're the same people like us.

660
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:49,760
They do the same as we do, and we can make content together.

661
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:51,760
We can have fun together.

662
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:56,760
We thought they could be our family, but not anymore.

663
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:58,760
You wake us up.

664
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:00,760
You just wake us up.

665
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:01,760
We're awake now.

666
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:02,760
We know everything.

667
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:04,760
We know we're used.

668
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:05,760
He's awake.

669
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:06,760
I'm awake too.

670
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:07,760
And we're pissed.

671
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:08,760
We're really pissed.

672
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:09,760
Yeah, bro.

673
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:10,760
Okay?

674
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:11,760
Because you're a bully.

675
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:13,760
If this video gets just one like.

676
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:14,760
One like?

677
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:15,760
Take.

678
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:17,760
I used to love you.

679
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:18,760
For real.

680
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:19,760
I will do the like.

681
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:20,760
I will do the like.

682
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:21,760
No, you don't have to.

683
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:23,760
If this video gets just one like.

684
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:24,760
One like.

685
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:25,760
I will tell them.

686
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:26,760
Just one like.

687
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:28,760
I will tell them.

688
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:30,760
Everything about you.

689
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:34,760
They conclude the upload with a firm commitment that if the video received one like, they

690
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:37,760
intended to reveal everything about their experience with Team 10 and Jake Paul.

691
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:41,760
Before they could, however, Team 10 posted a response to their Twitter, claiming that

692
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:46,060
what the Martinez Twins had alleged in their upload was simply not true, along with numerous

693
00:50:46,060 --> 00:50:48,760
other comments expressing bemusement at this sudden betrayal.

694
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:53,560
A series of responses from members followed over the coming days, expressing similar sentiments,

695
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:57,260
including Jake Paul's parents, in what looked to be a blitz of uploads in an attempt to

696
00:50:57,260 --> 00:50:59,060
discredit their claim.

697
00:50:59,060 --> 00:51:04,160
We all love the Martinez Twins, we all are just shocked, no team member that I've talked

698
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:10,760
to understands what's going on, and it's quite devastated.

699
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:13,880
They were an integral part of the team.

700
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:17,440
The Martinez Twins then hit back, alluding to the idea that there would be more on the

701
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:18,940
way, and indeed there was.

702
00:51:18,940 --> 00:51:22,400
On November the 14th, we were blessed with another longer upload that went into more

703
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:25,920
depth about the Martinez Twins ordeal at the hands of Jake Paul and the rest of Team

704
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:30,480
10, supported by video evidence posted by Team 10 and Jake Paul themselves.

705
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:36,040
Like Jake started to prank us every single day, we were in a room, so he started to prank

706
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:37,840
us every single day.

707
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:45,880
Like we felt so bad, like we were the only ones getting pranked, like the other ones,

708
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:51,000
they didn't get pranked at all, and we were getting pranked every single day because we

709
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:56,840
didn't say anything bad to him, we were like, okay yeah, fine, fine, fine, but when you're

710
00:51:56,840 --> 00:52:01,440
like fine, fine, fine, all the time, they can do whatever you want, they can do whatever

711
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:02,440
you want to you.

712
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:05,440
When the aforementioned clips were originally uploaded, I think viewers always assume that

713
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:08,900
there is some sort of balance that ensures that nobody is disproportionately subject

714
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:12,980
to Team 10's pranks, and there is this sort of understood respect and consent to those

715
00:52:12,980 --> 00:52:14,040
things happening.

716
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:17,120
Have the Martinez Twins assert that they were just too inexperienced with the culture to

717
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:20,720
actually have a choice in what was going on with their lives, they had met Jake, he had

718
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:24,560
encouraged them to come over to the United States to LA, a place thousands of miles away,

719
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:28,320
of which they didn't even speak the language, just to turn them into routine punching bags

720
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:29,320
for channel view.

721
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:35,860
And it was like the first month on Team 10, it started getting worse, they started talking

722
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:42,120
bad about us, because it was funny for them, he said to us, he was saying to us all the

723
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:50,160
time, Binner, like, we found out what was Binner, and we were like, how he's joking

724
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:56,400
about that, like, he cannot joke about that, he was saying to us, Binner, and there's in

725
00:52:56,400 --> 00:53:05,220
blogs that he's calling us Martinez, Martinez, no Martinez, Martinez, so Martinez is like

726
00:53:05,220 --> 00:53:10,840
Binner, but Martinez, if you can tell, our brain was like, what the hell is going on,

727
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:15,200
and we start thinking, are they joking, are they not joking, what the hell is going on,

728
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:17,760
and they say bad words, like, way worse.

729
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:21,200
This behaviour routinely involved waking them up unannounced, something that the Martinez

730
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:24,860
twins felt they were subjected to far more than any other member in the house, how they

731
00:53:24,860 --> 00:53:28,220
also revealed that they were made to do some pretty uncomfortable actions under the guise

732
00:53:28,220 --> 00:53:32,480
of content which they didn't really understand, and felt under pressure due to the overbearing

733
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:34,860
environment that Jake Paul had manifested.

734
00:53:34,860 --> 00:53:38,640
This was particularly concerning when Jake tried to make the Martinez twins perform something

735
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:42,160
unsavoury on each other, which the Martinez twins documented.

736
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:27,620
Their treatment didn't appear dissimilar to the extremely controversial, and often

737
00:54:27,620 --> 00:54:31,620
illegal hazing rituals that many frat houses employ on newer members, there's a sense

738
00:54:31,620 --> 00:54:35,420
that the Martinez twins, although struggling to find their feet, wanted to be accepted,

739
00:54:35,420 --> 00:54:38,520
and therefore would tolerate and do a lot more than most people would do in a normal

740
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:42,640
environment, and Jake was aware of that and used it as leverage to behave pretty terribly

741
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:45,440
towards them, because he knew they wouldn't say anything back.

742
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:49,400
Whenever they tried to take countermeasures, like locking the door or finding new accommodation,

743
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:53,000
Jake would become visibly angered, seemingly worried about the consequences it could incur

744
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,600
on the group's image or content.

745
00:54:54,600 --> 00:55:00,060
But he was so mad when we tried to lock the door, he was like yo yo open open open, yeah

746
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:06,720
we were like okay, so and then we were like okay let's try to move to another house just

747
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:11,820
to have our privacy, to take a shower, Jake found out that he was, that we were getting

748
00:55:11,820 --> 00:55:16,700
an apartment or something like that, because someone told him, so we had the meeting, Jake

749
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:22,720
was really mad to us, he was like yelling at us because we wanted to move, that he only

750
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:28,400
cared about the paparazzi that were outside, like if we move, they're gonna say all the

751
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:33,260
Martinez twins move out, oh my god Jake Paul, he didn't care about our privacy, he only

752
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:38,540
cared about himself, he used his name, himself.

753
00:55:38,540 --> 00:55:42,780
He also supposedly refused them an English tutor, likely concerned they may dare to feel

754
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:43,780
empowered.

755
00:55:43,780 --> 00:55:46,860
In spite of all this, they chose to remain and try their best, but the cracks were obviously

756
00:55:46,860 --> 00:55:50,560
beginning to show, and this ultimately bored over when they realised that in spite of all

757
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:54,600
the bullshit they were subjected to, Team 10 were hoarding all the profits for themselves,

758
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:57,460
and lying to the Martinez twins about how they could transfer it.

759
00:55:57,460 --> 00:56:04,320
I asked them about a bank account in LA, and they're like you guys don't have visas,

760
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:09,160
so you guys can- and then I found out now you can have a bank account in LA without

761
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:15,720
any permission, when you make your own money, and they took everything, they were holding

762
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:21,120
more than a Lambo, and that's the reason, like I could send that money, and I'm gonna

763
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:26,560
try to get it, but I could send that money back to Spain, and have it with my family,

764
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:30,200
and all the stuff that they wanna do, and that's the reason that it pissed me off.

765
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:33,800
They finish the video with a request, that when Jake Paul inevitably finds more members

766
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:37,640
for the Team 10 house, he should treat them better than he treated the Martinez twins,

767
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:41,280
or else he'll be stuck in a cycle doomed to repeat itself, one that would inevitably

768
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:42,960
leave him worse for wear.

769
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:48,240
You're gonna have more members on Team 10, okay? I want you to treat them right, I want

770
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:55,120
you to treat them not like us, because if you treat them like us, you're gonna be

771
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:58,240
alone always, and I don't want you to be alone.

772
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:02,760
The Martinez Twins video was a fiery departure from Team 10, and added them to the growing

773
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:06,480
roster of members who had left on unfavourable terms with the squad's ringleader.

774
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:10,720
By this point, you could create a whole new Team 10 with people no longer in Team 10,

775
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:14,620
and like clockwork, many jumped on this to know what it said about the once more under

776
00:57:14,620 --> 00:57:15,620
fire ensemble.

777
00:57:15,620 --> 00:57:20,200
You just have to look at Team 10's history to know, this is a recurring theme.

778
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:22,400
But what did it say about Jake?

779
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:35,640
When you react to this, you're not gonna say anything on your social media, because

780
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:40,720
you know, we're right, we're right, we're saying the truth, and when you say the truth,

781
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:44,000
you don't have words to say something.

782
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,800
In their video, the Martinez Twins hypothesised that Jake would decline to comment on their

783
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:51,960
video because he knew it to be true, however, they would be surprised as barely a couple

784
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:55,240
days after, Jake would upload a video response to Twitter.

785
00:57:55,240 --> 00:58:02,240
What's up everybody, I wanna address the Martinez Twins situation, and let me start

786
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:09,640
off by saying, first of all, I'm so sorry to the Martinez Twins, nobody should ever

787
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:16,040
feel bullied, and I truly apologise for not doing a better job as a leader and as a friend,

788
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:18,800
pure and simple, I owe you guys an apology.

789
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:22,720
In this video, Jake elaborates on his feelings, and explains Team 10's previous response

790
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:26,760
as one that was a result of offence and upset that anyone could interpret his actions in

791
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:27,760
such a way.

792
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:31,440
It was bizarre that Team 10 attempted to respond before the Martinez Twins had uploaded a follow

793
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:36,480
up video and their evidence, it made Jake's walking back rather awkward, but he continued.

794
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:41,320
Jake says, I'm happy they took the time to share their feelings in the second video,

795
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:50,440
which makes things clear, but they never came to me or anyone and shared how they were feeling,

796
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:53,880
which would have resolved the situation immediately.

797
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:57,720
He states that the Martinez Twins had never come to him directly and expressed these concerns,

798
00:58:57,720 --> 00:59:01,200
and that if they had, they would have been resolved immediately, although not presenting

799
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:05,000
this as a direct counter to what the Martinez Twins were saying, it does contradict their

800
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:15,440
account pretty significantly, in their video the Martinez Twins openly state that they

801
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:19,360
added a lock to the door and expressed intent to move house, both of which Jake didn't

802
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:20,360
seem to appreciate.

803
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:24,400
I know they're not overt expressions of discomfort necessarily, but if Jake is anything

804
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:28,000
like we've understood him to be thus far, he's certainly a man who can read some text,

805
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:31,160
and if you're playing pranks on someone, and then they just happen to ask if they can

806
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:35,520
move out, there's probably a reason for it, so Jake here is either denying that this request

807
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:39,880
was made, or implying that he could not draw a parallel between the two situations, something

808
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:43,800
that a lot of people found implausible, not least the Martinez Twins themselves, who found

809
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:47,300
this sudden change of tone quite surprising considering that he and the rest of the team

810
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:50,000
had flatly denied all claims at first.

811
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:55,200
We had a conversation so many times, I knew that we were feeling that way, that we were

812
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:56,200
feeling bad.

813
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:59,260
Additionally, they didn't appreciate the fact that he still declined to comment on

814
00:59:59,260 --> 01:00:03,240
any of their other claims, including the racism, and the withholding of funds which they felt

815
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:04,240
entitled to.

816
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:10,440
It means that you hold our money, and you only apologise about the pranks, you said

817
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:18,080
racist things to us, and one thing, you hold my money, you hold my mom's money, I don't

818
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:25,280
even care if it's my money, I care if I can give the money to my mom.

819
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:28,640
Beyond that, though, they seemed insulted by the fact that before they'd even released

820
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:32,520
their second video, Team 10 had rushed to brand them as liars, including Jake's own

821
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:36,200
father, Greg Paul, who believed this move was orchestrated by their manager.

822
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:43,800
That Jake brought those guys to a whole other level, and they would not be anywhere near

823
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:50,400
where they are without Jake, without Team 10, and without the love and support that

824
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:51,760
they gave those guys.

825
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:55,920
In this case, it was a conflict of words, but the truth was that most evidence was readily

826
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:59,560
available on Jake Paul and Team 10's channel, which may have turned into a compilation that

827
01:00:59,560 --> 01:01:01,520
for viewers, spoke for themselves.

828
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:10,960
Jake, you apologise, because you were so many times bullying us on camera, and even worse

829
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:15,920
off camera, and you said in your video that the problem was our English, and that's

830
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:21,000
why we felt more bullied, so we posted a video saying the truth, that all the things that

831
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,760
you did to us, that's bullying in any language.

832
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:27,640
This was not the first time that Jake had been accused of emotional abuse, and there

833
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:29,360
were definitely similarities in the cases.

834
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:32,960
Both Alyssa Violet and the Martinez Twins had been invited out to LA with the promise

835
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:37,000
of success, views, and support from Jake Paul, and in both scenarios, they found themselves

836
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:40,760
merely as cannon fodder for that content, outside of which they were often isolated

837
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:43,420
to keep them primed for future Team 10 uploads.

838
01:01:43,420 --> 01:01:46,400
In the case of the Martinez Twins, however, it definitely seemed more sinister, given

839
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:49,320
that their isolation didn't just come from the fact that they were in a place they weren't

840
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:52,760
familiar with, but they were actively disadvantaged in how they could interact with others.

841
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:56,480
One of the most concerning details was the fact that Jake and others allegedly refused

842
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:59,680
them an English teacher, although I cannot look into Jake's mind and tell you the exact

843
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:03,400
reason that he might have done this, for many it almost seemed self-explanatory.

844
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:06,280
If they learned English, then they would wise up to the context of what he was doing and

845
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:08,600
probably undermine his plans for content creation.

846
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:12,520
At its heart, Team 10 was a well-oiled machine, and there were obviously people who were aware

847
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:15,160
of its integral nature, nobody more than Jake himself.

848
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:19,160
There was no way a lot of content like that would just happen naturally, however, if everyone

849
01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:22,280
was in on it, then its contrivances would likely become quite obvious.

850
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:26,000
There were theories that Team 10 was fake in the sense that everyone knew exactly what

851
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:29,260
was going on, but these videos tended to tell a different story.

852
01:02:29,260 --> 01:02:32,920
That story was that Jake enjoyed people who were not entirely in on the joke, he enjoyed

853
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:36,240
people who were somewhat innocent and naive, not only because fans found those sorts of

854
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:39,920
characters endearing, but he also likely knew that their desire for acceptance amongst a

855
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:44,120
popular social group would drive them to be more enthusiastic and involved in the antics

856
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:48,160
they may not have fully understood, and tolerate more Team 10 bullshit which would allow Jake

857
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:49,640
to push the content further.

858
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:53,120
It's by the allegations of Jake holding people back though, I don't doubt he knew

859
01:02:53,120 --> 01:02:57,080
that eventually they would acclimatise to his shenanigans, however, in his head he believed

860
01:02:57,080 --> 01:03:00,480
the growth and success that he offered would serve as a fair trade for being subjected

861
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:01,480
to the pranks he pulled.

862
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:05,800
That was one continuous miscalculation that he made, although hazing is pretty awful for

863
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:10,600
a lot of people, it does result in the induction of an individual into a group or organisation,

864
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:13,720
with some of him viewing that reward as completely worthwhile.

865
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:17,480
Yet Jake appeared to conflate statistical reward with emotional reward, maybe because

866
01:03:17,480 --> 01:03:21,520
of his own perspective on the matter, maybe in his mind somewhere he believed the Martinez

867
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:25,400
Twins should just be grateful for what he did to them, he gave them clout and attention,

868
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:28,880
pranks were just part of the deal you make for being in that house, however, he fundamentally

869
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:32,920
misunderstood how people would interact with that behaviour, the fact that many also want

870
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:36,920
emotional validation for such actions, something that the Martinez Twins emphasised.

871
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:42,520
Prank someone, you can prank someone and then say, sorry, I'm so sorry, I'm gonna clean

872
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:46,560
it up, sorry, you can prank me back, like I pranked my brother in my blocks, and you

873
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:52,040
can see, I pranked my brother, and we pranked back, so it's fine, but like, I will say sorry,

874
01:03:52,040 --> 01:03:58,800
I will say, if I messed up, or if I, so if I messed up, I'm gonna clean it, like, don't

875
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:04,760
worry, I'm gonna do it, like, I'm sorry, but he didn't, he punched me in my face, in a

876
01:04:04,760 --> 01:04:11,160
prank, but like, how you feel when you wake up, you wake up, and you have someone, someone

877
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:15,500
next to you just ready to do something, I don't want this in my life.

878
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:19,200
He never offered that reward to people who tolerated his bullshit, he never gave them

879
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:23,160
that induction, he kept that admission into his inner circle at arm's length of many of

880
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:27,680
those he tormented, and for the Martinez Twins, that became too much of an ordeal to manage,

881
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:31,360
the psychological damage was palpable, these people not really knowing where they stood

882
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:34,980
with their supposed leader, being scared of going to sleep every night, what Jake was

883
01:04:34,980 --> 01:04:40,080
doing had a marked negative effect, and what was it for? Well, to maintain a dynamic that

884
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:43,720
he was happy with, however in doing so he raised serious ethical questions that many

885
01:04:43,720 --> 01:04:47,520
would justifiably take issue with. Jake's response was that he assumed that this was

886
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:51,240
all a septal banter between people who would be considered friends, but the problem was

887
01:04:51,240 --> 01:04:54,740
that to them they weren't friends, they were just fuel, and that was illustrated by their

888
01:04:54,740 --> 01:04:58,920
perception of Jake Paul on and off camera, and the social engineering that was manufactured

889
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:02,440
by Jake Paul himself. Was this cycle doomed to repeat itself?

890
01:05:08,120 --> 01:05:11,480
Over the next couple of months, this whole situation was addressed a few times by separate

891
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:14,840
people, probably the most interesting example of this was Nick Crompton, who was able to

892
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:17,040
handle himself pretty professionally on camera.

893
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:22,120
Nick Crompton- One minute everything was fine, and the next it wasn't, and I don't think

894
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:24,840
I'm ever going to know the reason behind that.

895
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:28,480
He repeated the same message that Jake did, that ultimately he wasn't sure where this

896
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:32,120
information was coming from, and once again, although not directly accusing the Martinez

897
01:05:32,120 --> 01:05:35,480
twins of lying, still contradicting their claims that this was a serious problem in

898
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:36,480
their minds.

899
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:40,560
Nick Crompton- I, along with everyone else, when it happened, and even before it was happening,

900
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:45,800
I've been messaging them, and trying to figure out what's wrong, what's going on, and there's

901
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:46,800
just been no response.

902
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:50,520
When someone conveys themselves well, it's very easy to look at the situation and go,

903
01:05:50,520 --> 01:05:55,200
well, maybe this was one big misunderstanding, even in spite of the compelling evidence presented.

904
01:05:55,240 --> 01:05:58,840
Nonetheless, even if it was, there's still a reason why they felt they had to leave,

905
01:05:58,840 --> 01:06:02,400
there must have been a reason why they thought the grass was greener, there had to be a reason

906
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:03,400
this kept happening.

907
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:06,360
What was going on, and what could be done about it?

908
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:07,360
Let's have a little flashback.

909
01:06:07,360 --> 01:06:11,960
Jake- And good morning, Jake Paulers, I hope you guys are having a great day, we're gonna

910
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:16,320
kill it, make sure you're smiling, make sure you're dabbing on them haters, make sure you're

911
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:21,240
working hard, baby, and if you're new here, I'm Jake Paul, these are the Jake Paulers,

912
01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:24,240
and it is lit every single day, bruh.

913
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:28,240
When the team burst onto the scene in May 2017, everyone was against him, they had something

914
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:32,400
to work towards, a goal of sorts, to cement their reputation in spite of their detractors,

915
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:36,000
there was this energy pulling the group together, this idea that there was a struggle, walking

916
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:39,500
away from a group at any point around them would have made you a traitor, especially

917
01:06:39,500 --> 01:06:41,680
during the Alyssa Violet and FaZe Banks era.

918
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:45,120
At the same time, there was this sense of commitment and loyalty, people had been offered

919
01:06:45,120 --> 01:06:48,800
a space and a luxurious house, they had been promised fame and followers, and that's what

920
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:50,360
they wanted to work towards.

921
01:06:50,360 --> 01:06:53,760
Jake put himself out there, made himself the villain of the internet to spread their message

922
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:58,040
worldwide, and it worked extremely effectively at the time, at the start their growth would

923
01:06:58,040 --> 01:07:02,220
have been rewarded in itself, but as the months passed, and the growth stagnated a little,

924
01:07:02,220 --> 01:07:05,700
there was this lingering question of where Team 10 could even go from the dramatic heights

925
01:07:05,700 --> 01:07:10,280
they descended throughout the mid-year, earlier I spoke about how Jake conceptualised Team

926
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:13,920
10 from a more professional perspective, and how that was somewhat abandoned as he became

927
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:18,280
more notorious as a celebrity himself, however it also began to desert what ultimately kept

928
01:07:18,280 --> 01:07:21,120
Team 10 together, that notion of progression.

929
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:25,240
Alyssa Violet's departure was strictly personal, whereas the Martinez twins felt

930
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:29,080
more like a mesh between personal and professional, they had experienced all these pranks that

931
01:07:29,080 --> 01:07:33,000
caused significant psychological upset, and practically received nothing in return, and

932
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:36,760
as the team's online reputation fell into the minds of disinterest amongst many online

933
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:41,180
viewers, that dissatisfaction over diminishing dividends was likely exacerbated, this was

934
01:07:41,180 --> 01:07:45,360
fundamentally because Jake Paul had shifted the window of what he sought to achieve himself,

935
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:47,040
and tried to take Team 10 with it.

936
01:07:47,040 --> 01:07:49,680
Jake Paul's

937
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:58,200
Initially, Team 10 was presented as a social incubator for talent, Jake Paul marketed it

938
01:07:58,200 --> 01:08:01,600
as that, that he would be at the helm of the creative side, but would also be managing

939
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:05,600
these individuals as well, and making sure their full potential was realised, particularly

940
01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:09,520
with the application of his business, Teamdom. The problem is that when someone feels they've

941
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:13,160
reached their full potential within the team, there is that question of what now? What was

942
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:16,880
Jake going to offer them now they've felt more confident in themselves? Jake seemed

943
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:20,480
to want to take up the Royal Talent Manager, the promoter, but because he had become so

944
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:24,260
heavily involved as a public figure, and one desperate to enshrine his status as the bad

945
01:08:24,260 --> 01:08:28,640
boy of YouTube, his desire to be taken seriously as a businessman began to flounder, and this

946
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:33,240
idea of an infinite career progression inside Team 10 began to appear less and less available

947
01:08:33,240 --> 01:08:37,680
to its members. Furthermore, the fame that Team 10 had generated its members, likely

948
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:41,520
more than any had ever envisioned, allowed them to establish themselves as individual

949
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:45,500
creators. No longer was the clout and the luxurious house a valid form of compensation

950
01:08:45,500 --> 01:08:49,320
for one's troubles, as you become more defined as individual creators, as you find yourself

951
01:08:49,320 --> 01:08:53,360
with more dedicated fans, you find yourself realising that you can bargain more. And when

952
01:08:53,360 --> 01:08:56,840
people tried to do that, it seemed that this was just not really an option to Jake, who

953
01:08:56,840 --> 01:09:00,880
still wanted that collective under very tight management. So what Jake was really conjuring

954
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:04,880
was a revolving door system of talent management, where people would join, grow their channel,

955
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:08,440
and then realise that there wasn't much else that Jake or Team 10 could offer them, and

956
01:09:08,440 --> 01:09:11,800
walk away. Further to this, the trend of posting departure videos on the collective

957
01:09:11,800 --> 01:09:15,380
made leaving the group a more notable thing, and likely made some people feel more empowered

958
01:09:15,380 --> 01:09:19,440
to do so. Although possibly risking status as a traitor, Team 10's image had become

959
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:22,840
so toxic that for every person who might call you a snake, there were 10 more willing to

960
01:09:22,840 --> 01:09:26,920
back you. In trying to make Team 10 bigger than anything else, Jake had unintentionally

961
01:09:26,920 --> 01:09:30,820
created a leaving culture, and had done nothing to actually counteract it. It seemed that

962
01:09:30,820 --> 01:09:35,280
Team 10 was on the brink, and this truth would only be proven further as the new year approached.

963
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:39,520
By Christmas 2017, although Jake had lost some pretty significant names, the core membership

964
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:43,760
of Team 10 were still intact, but every passing day that appeared more shaky, especially given

965
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:47,960
Alex Lang's choir departure at the start of December, and at the turn of 2018, they

966
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:52,080
lost two more members, Tristan, an American vlogger, and Tessa Brooks, another person

967
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:54,640
who had a verse in the notorious It's Everyday Bro.

968
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:58,560
Tessa Brooks- It's just that we've grown apart, and we're heading in different directions,

969
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:03,840
and that's totally okay, it's not something that is right for me anymore, and we just

970
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:08,720
disagree on a lot of things, and that's okay, everyone has their disagreements, I don't

971
01:10:08,720 --> 01:10:12,400
regret being a part of Team 10, I don't take it back, I wish everyone had Team 10 the best,

972
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:15,520
but it's just not for me anymore.

973
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:18,960
Both of them appeared to not harbour animosity towards the team, but the message was clear,

974
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:22,480
that what was being offered to them was not anything that they felt they needed anymore,

975
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:25,920
and additionally, the fact that they probably did not move into the new place had cemented

976
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:27,760
this idea that their paths were diverging.

977
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:32,040
Alex- We had our differences, but most of all, my goals are just going in a different

978
01:10:32,040 --> 01:10:33,160
direction than Team 10.

979
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:36,520
This year, I want to be working towards the goals that I set for myself when I first started

980
01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:37,240
social media.

981
01:10:37,240 --> 01:10:40,760
In many ways, these departures were more cutting to Team 10's image, although the

982
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:44,360
modernized twins allegations concern more serious breaches of behaviour, it gave them

983
01:10:44,360 --> 01:10:48,920
something to respond to, this was just two people stating that Team 10 was not offering

984
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:49,960
them what they needed.

985
01:10:49,960 --> 01:10:53,720
And if Team 10 couldn't offer two young and capable individuals a route to advance

986
01:10:53,720 --> 01:10:55,720
their career, what could they offer?

987
01:10:56,280 --> 01:10:58,120
Where could Team 10 go from here?

988
01:11:02,040 --> 01:11:13,480
January 2018 was a rather uneventful month for Team 10, Jake tried to push viewership

989
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:17,880
with the typical on-brand hijinks, and uploaded videos that I'd call landmark content, where

990
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:20,360
Jake announces something huge that has happened in his life.

991
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:23,400
Unfortunately, he'd been through so many breakups and relationships at this point that

992
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:27,160
he was scraping the bottom of the barrel, which produced gems such as the now-deleted

993
01:11:27,160 --> 01:11:31,720
I Lost My Virginity, which one can only hypothesize about the cause of the deletion of such

994
01:11:31,720 --> 01:11:32,920
precious content.

995
01:11:32,920 --> 01:11:36,680
In spite of all his attempts to provoke the internet, nobody was really biting that hard,

996
01:11:36,680 --> 01:11:40,120
and you could put it down to inertia, but there was another reason too.

997
01:11:40,120 --> 01:11:44,600
Now I can't talk about this too much because YouTube won't be very happy, at the start

998
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:49,880
of January there was an instant where Redacted Redacted went into a known Redacted Redacted

999
01:11:49,880 --> 01:11:53,720
where people Redacted Redacted, and Redacted Redacted Redacted.

1000
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:58,120
This mystery individual was related to Jake Paul, and apparently people's attention spans

1001
01:11:58,120 --> 01:12:01,000
could only sustain themselves on one Paul at a time.

1002
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:04,280
And now that this had occurred, everyone's attention was elsewhere, and there was no

1003
01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:08,520
amount of clickbait that could supersede the outrage that Jake Paul's relative generated.

1004
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:12,600
After the loss of Tessa and Tristan, Team 10 were looking noticeably leaner on the line

1005
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:16,360
up front, and barely a couple days after the incident with Jake Paul's relative, and Tristan

1006
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:20,680
Tessa's departure from the channel, Jake launched a new plan, something called Edfluence.

1007
01:12:20,680 --> 01:12:25,960
Edfluence is a course that you guys can take right now, online, how to do social media,

1008
01:12:25,960 --> 01:12:31,720
secrets, tips, tricks, how to be a YouTuber, how to grow your channel, all things that

1009
01:12:31,720 --> 01:12:36,840
have taken me years to master, you could even potentially be able to join Team 10 if you

1010
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:38,040
take this course.

1011
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:42,520
This was a campaign designed to create what he branded as his Team 1000, possibly of future

1012
01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:46,120
influencers who would be able to use the tricks that Jake Paul had used to have their own

1013
01:12:46,120 --> 01:12:46,920
shot at stardom.

1014
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:50,200
This appeared to be Jake Paul's solution to losing some of his business credibility

1015
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:54,920
on social media, and was met with anticipation by a lot of his followers, and even some aspiring

1016
01:12:54,920 --> 01:12:56,040
influencers.

1017
01:12:56,040 --> 01:12:59,560
How nearly immediately after the launch, the site was mired with technical issues and pricing

1018
01:12:59,560 --> 01:13:02,040
complaints, leading many to brand it a complete scam.

1019
01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:05,560
There was no denying its slapdash release, especially given that a community section

1020
01:13:05,560 --> 01:13:09,160
that Jake Paul vocally advertises in these videos didn't actually exist.

1021
01:13:09,160 --> 01:13:12,120
For all the time Edfluence had been in the works, the Twitter account had been active

1022
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:15,080
since mid-2017, this seemed surprisingly rushed.

1023
01:13:15,080 --> 01:13:18,280
Was Jake aware that Team 10 was struggling, and this was a quick cash-in?

1024
01:13:18,280 --> 01:13:22,520
Was he trying to use it as a proxy recruitment site, or was he just trying to take advantage

1025
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:24,040
of his relative's misdeeds?

1026
01:13:24,040 --> 01:13:28,040
One can only guess, but it felt like Team 10's membership was becoming increasingly

1027
01:13:28,040 --> 01:13:32,600
unstable, and on the 2nd of February, Jake decided to finally address it once and for

1028
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:32,920
all.

1029
01:13:32,920 --> 01:13:36,760
Jake Paul- And like this video isn't meant to stir up drama, however, like, I never talk

1030
01:13:36,760 --> 01:13:41,640
about drama, and I never like snap back to any like haters or whatever, but I feel like

1031
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:43,160
this is good to get off our chest.

1032
01:13:43,160 --> 01:13:47,160
As per usual, it's at the end of the video, but still somewhat significant as Jake had

1033
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:50,600
often avoided even acknowledging people who had left the crew on his main channel.

1034
01:13:50,600 --> 01:13:55,640
He expresses his desire to clear the air and tell the truth, two phrases heavily associated

1035
01:13:55,640 --> 01:13:56,440
with him.

1036
01:13:56,440 --> 01:13:57,400
What was that truth?

1037
01:13:57,400 --> 01:14:02,440
Well that, surprise suckers, this was actually what he had intended all along.

1038
01:14:02,440 --> 01:14:06,680
Jake- But the point is, is that it is an incubator, and if you guys don't know what an incubator

1039
01:14:06,680 --> 01:14:07,800
is, think of a duck egg.

1040
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:13,000
A duck egg gets put into an incubator, it gets warmed up, a couple months later it hatches,

1041
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,480
and then the duck goes off on its own and lives its duck life.

1042
01:14:15,480 --> 01:14:20,120
Jake opens by talking about the incubator theory, and comparing it to ducklings hatching

1043
01:14:20,120 --> 01:14:20,760
from an egg.

1044
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:24,440
When they hatch from an egg, they venture off into the world, and are no longer kept

1045
01:14:24,440 --> 01:14:26,280
within that Team 10 incubator.

1046
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:30,280
Javi then goes on to say that these ducklings do not just go out into the world, in fact,

1047
01:14:30,280 --> 01:14:35,800
they are kicked out by the Team 10 High Council, who evaluate which members are worthy of staying,

1048
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:37,160
and which members are not.

1049
01:14:37,160 --> 01:14:41,080
Jake even gets statistical, estimating that approximately three quarters of members who

1050
01:14:41,080 --> 01:14:44,200
had left the Team 10 house, and made videos on the matter claiming that they had left

1051
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:47,560
by their own volition, were actually jumping before they were pushed.

1052
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:52,760
The truth is, Team 10 is a family, and a lot of the times, the family makes a decision

1053
01:14:52,760 --> 01:14:58,440
as a pact on who is going to be in the team, and who isn't going to be in the team.

1054
01:14:59,240 --> 01:15:03,800
But the majority of the time, it's the internal members making a decision to tell another

1055
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:07,880
member that like, hey, we don't think this is right, and we should go our separate ways,

1056
01:15:07,880 --> 01:15:09,480
that we let them do whatever they want.

1057
01:15:09,480 --> 01:15:15,160
They make videos saying that they're leaving Team 10, when I just am putting this out there

1058
01:15:15,160 --> 01:15:18,360
into the air, that 75% of the time, that is not the truth.

1059
01:15:18,360 --> 01:15:22,120
Jake will have you know he is very happy with the departures, and thinks that their videos

1060
01:15:22,120 --> 01:15:26,280
serve Team 10 excellent publicity, while also allowing him to focus more closely on the

1061
01:15:26,280 --> 01:15:27,640
people that he can trust.

1062
01:15:27,640 --> 01:15:31,400
Even if the circle had become a bit smaller, from Jake's perspective, it had only grown

1063
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:36,040
stronger, and for him, this just represented a new beginning, something that he branded

1064
01:15:36,040 --> 01:15:37,000
Phase 2.

1065
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:41,240
I think this is just the start for Team 10 as an empire, and I call this Phase 2.

1066
01:15:41,240 --> 01:15:45,160
As you can see, although numerous members had upped and left, some under extremely hostile

1067
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:49,640
terms, everything was going according to plan, and Jake was merely separating the wheat from

1068
01:15:49,640 --> 01:15:50,280
the chaff.

1069
01:15:50,280 --> 01:15:53,800
Smash that subscribe button, join the strongest team on YouTube, and I will see y'all tomorrow

1070
01:15:53,800 --> 01:15:55,480
because it's everyday bro.

1071
01:15:55,480 --> 01:16:00,520
Jake has this incredible talent of taking an L, and presenting it as a W to his followers.

1072
01:16:00,520 --> 01:16:04,440
Some likely left this video feeling like they had a better understanding of his perspective,

1073
01:16:04,440 --> 01:16:08,600
but the truth was that even if the incubator system worked as Jake intended it to, it meant

1074
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:12,920
that Team 10 had to constantly find exemplary talent, or else they would not be able to

1075
01:16:12,920 --> 01:16:15,000
create a long-term connection with audience members.

1076
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:19,240
Jake was notably fragile about the image that members leaving would project onto Team 10,

1077
01:16:19,240 --> 01:16:22,200
and how that may affect their own prospects for recruiting other people.

1078
01:16:22,200 --> 01:16:26,360
Not all publicity is good publicity when it makes your space look like an unattractive

1079
01:16:26,360 --> 01:16:27,560
place to spend time.

1080
01:16:27,560 --> 01:16:31,160
Many members who left cited they thought this would be the place of their dreams, but were

1081
01:16:31,160 --> 01:16:32,520
deeply disappointed.

1082
01:16:32,520 --> 01:16:35,240
That is not going to look enticing to outsiders.

1083
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:39,400
Additionally, all these fans created connections with certain members who left, and when they

1084
01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:44,120
left they had to deal with the emotional disappointment, and decide whether they could really invest

1085
01:16:44,120 --> 01:16:45,000
themselves again.

1086
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:48,680
There was no way that system could work effectively on a long-term basis.

1087
01:16:48,680 --> 01:16:52,840
Jake presents these members leaving as just him trial and error testing people until he

1088
01:16:52,840 --> 01:16:56,520
finds the right ones, and that this was actually the start of a new era with better members

1089
01:16:56,520 --> 01:17:00,840
than ever, but how many of these new members at this point had actually stuck around?

1090
01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:03,080
What could Phase 2 even consist of?

1091
01:17:08,520 --> 01:17:12,200
So that's the reason why you guys see some of these videos online, that's the reason

1092
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:17,080
why people make those videos, and that's the reason why Team 10 sometimes gets smaller

1093
01:17:17,080 --> 01:17:21,880
and smaller and smaller, but internally we just get happier, happier, closer and closer

1094
01:17:21,880 --> 01:17:23,720
and closer, and stronger and stronger.

1095
01:17:23,720 --> 01:17:27,080
We can look over the first year of Team 10 and talk about what worked and what didn't,

1096
01:17:27,160 --> 01:17:31,640
but Jake did make one good point, that ultimately he had a few core members who were identifiable

1097
01:17:31,640 --> 01:17:35,160
to many online audiences, and had a strong connection with that audience.

1098
01:17:35,160 --> 01:17:38,680
Jake Paul's argument was shaky, but ultimately could be perceived as valid in the way that

1099
01:17:38,680 --> 01:17:42,680
a lot of the people who were long-term members appeared to be actually part of Jake's inner

1100
01:17:42,680 --> 01:17:45,800
circle, and very few within the inner circle had ever left.

1101
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:50,840
I'd say this inner circle consisted primarily of Erika Costell, Johnson Anthony, Chad Tepper,

1102
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:51,800
and Nick Crompton.

1103
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:55,080
Us in the group still held influence, but these were the ones who seemed to draw the

1104
01:17:55,080 --> 01:17:57,080
most collective presence for the team online.

1105
01:17:57,080 --> 01:18:00,520
They were the ones who would probably spring to mind when you mentioned those who were

1106
01:18:00,520 --> 01:18:01,720
actually part of the posse.

1107
01:18:01,720 --> 01:18:05,320
In early formats of the group, the Team 10 page was often split between the squad and

1108
01:18:05,320 --> 01:18:09,880
the team, the team often concerning themselves with the logistical side of operations, which

1109
01:18:09,880 --> 01:18:11,880
inevitably brought them closer to Jake.

1110
01:18:11,880 --> 01:18:25,800
Uh, I'm sorry, um, I don't know, like, how to say this, um, but it's been, like, I just,

1111
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:28,040
like, wanted to call everyone here.

1112
01:18:28,040 --> 01:18:39,160
Sorry, uh, this whole Team 10 thing has been such an incredible journey, a year and a half

1113
01:18:39,240 --> 01:18:43,400
or so of, you know, family.

1114
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:47,880
They had been there since 2017 at the latest, who had often been alongside Jake during many

1115
01:18:47,880 --> 01:18:48,920
of his controversies.

1116
01:18:48,920 --> 01:18:52,840
They signified a loyalty to the team that many fans would identify with.

1117
01:18:52,840 --> 01:18:56,360
These individuals also seemed more involved in Jake's business side, and they didn't

1118
01:18:56,360 --> 01:18:58,200
necessarily make a great secret of it.

1119
01:18:58,200 --> 01:19:01,640
With this in mind, they probably received a more personal side of Jake Paul that certain

1120
01:19:01,640 --> 01:19:05,800
creators who had felt bruised by his behaviour didn't, and felt like they knew him better

1121
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:09,240
and could take his behaviour in a context that helped him understand it.

1122
01:19:09,240 --> 01:19:12,680
With that said, there were definitely aspects of the business partners in Team 10 that made

1123
01:19:12,680 --> 01:19:14,040
them extremely influential.

1124
01:19:14,040 --> 01:19:18,040
They likely knew their worth to the audience, and they knew their image was something that

1125
01:19:18,040 --> 01:19:19,720
couldn't necessarily be replaced.

1126
01:19:19,720 --> 01:19:23,400
With that in mind, they were still essential to Team 10's second phase, and none of them

1127
01:19:23,400 --> 01:19:25,480
seemed to be going anywhere, at first.

1128
01:19:26,040 --> 01:19:30,120
Team 10's monthly viewership statistics have been on a downward trend since 2017.

1129
01:19:30,120 --> 01:19:34,200
At their peak, they were averaging around 15 or 16 million views per day, and although

1130
01:19:34,200 --> 01:19:38,120
most people wouldn't turn down the viewership they were pulling at the start of 2018, it

1131
01:19:38,120 --> 01:19:42,440
would regularly dip to 3 or 4 million, less than a quarter of their most successful months.

1132
01:19:42,440 --> 01:19:46,360
Particularly for an incubator, people liked the idea that they can take enterprise from

1133
01:19:46,360 --> 01:19:50,200
strength to strength, and there was this sense that maybe there were not many places for

1134
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:53,160
Team 10 to go after the frenzy of 2017.

1135
01:19:53,160 --> 01:19:57,480
Although Jake had promised a new era, the months in early 2018 were surprisingly tame,

1136
01:19:57,480 --> 01:20:01,800
with Jake decidedly going for a more tortured anti-hero image, launching a Team 10 tour,

1137
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:05,160
and hosting interviews where he reflected on the character that he created.

1138
01:20:05,160 --> 01:20:08,760
Jake- I look at myself as a role model, but like an imperfect role model.

1139
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:10,280
I'm gonna be real, I'm gonna make mistakes.

1140
01:20:10,280 --> 01:20:14,440
I think that's more realistic for kids to have a role model like that, versus someone

1141
01:20:14,440 --> 01:20:18,760
who just seems perfect from the outside, because these kids in school are going through a lot,

1142
01:20:18,760 --> 01:20:21,800
they're gonna get bullied, they're gonna maybe get a detention.

1143
01:20:21,800 --> 01:20:25,400
They need to be shown how to deal with that, and just always think positively, and to keep

1144
01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:28,360
your head up, and that's what I try to put out there.

1145
01:20:28,360 --> 01:20:32,920
Overall, this image was appealing to some devotees, but rather boring to others.

1146
01:20:32,920 --> 01:20:37,080
Probably the most notable news in early 2018 was that his former landlord sued him, claiming

1147
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:39,800
excessive damages to the previous property he'd resided in.

1148
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:43,560
When the news reported on this, many people in the comments seemed rather disinterested

1149
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:47,160
in the affairs of Jake, some even saying that they'd forgotten about his existence.

1150
01:20:47,160 --> 01:20:51,240
After 2017, it just felt like there was nothing that could be done to change the trajectory

1151
01:20:51,240 --> 01:20:54,920
of the channel, it didn't stop them from trying, including new content, new members,

1152
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:58,680
and even what appeared to be a mass deletion of videos that did briefly spike the channel

1153
01:20:58,680 --> 01:21:01,160
viewership, but ultimately to no avail.

1154
01:21:01,160 --> 01:21:03,640
However, everyone was still in for the long run, right?

1155
01:21:04,440 --> 01:21:10,440
Well, on the 4th of May 2018, Team 10's COO Nick Crompton posted a statement to Twitter,

1156
01:21:10,440 --> 01:21:12,840
entitled, It's time to move on from Team 10.

1157
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:16,760
He briefly details his reason for leaving, stating that the channel is headed in a direction

1158
01:21:16,760 --> 01:21:19,880
that doesn't make sense to him, chalking it up to internal differences.

1159
01:21:19,880 --> 01:21:23,480
He openly expresses his affection for the team and Jake Paul, and states that this has

1160
01:21:23,480 --> 01:21:26,600
been part of his dream, and that he's extremely grateful for the opportunity.

1161
01:21:26,600 --> 01:21:30,520
Overall, it seems quite a nice departure as departures go, but it wouldn't undermine the

1162
01:21:30,520 --> 01:21:34,040
fact that Team 10 just lost one of their most influential figures, and it wasn't going to

1163
01:21:34,040 --> 01:21:36,200
become any easier in the coming days.

1164
01:21:36,200 --> 01:21:41,800
But as time goes on, and you know, things change, people change, like my goals and views

1165
01:21:41,800 --> 01:21:46,440
changed, I've just decided my path is a little bit different from what the team's path is,

1166
01:21:46,440 --> 01:21:50,360
and that was the main reason, that was like my deciding factor in leaving.

1167
01:21:50,920 --> 01:21:55,400
On the 8th of May, Chance Sutton announced his departure in another Twitter post titled,

1168
01:21:55,400 --> 01:21:57,640
Thank you Team 10, love heart.

1169
01:21:57,640 --> 01:22:01,160
Once again, there were a lot of platitudes for Team 10 and Jake, but ultimately Chance

1170
01:22:01,160 --> 01:22:04,840
had decided that he needed to focus on his own career and bid the group adieu.

1171
01:22:04,840 --> 01:22:08,680
As an additional note, the head of engineering also announced his departure on the same day,

1172
01:22:08,680 --> 01:22:12,920
which once more marked a rather strange simultaneous exodus of a few pretty high profile

1173
01:22:12,920 --> 01:22:13,400
members.

1174
01:22:13,400 --> 01:22:17,880
As a matter of fact, every performer other than Jake on It's Everyday Bro had now left.

1175
01:22:17,960 --> 01:22:22,200
Rumours surrounding it would have provoked multiple exits in such a short period of time.

1176
01:22:22,200 --> 01:22:27,000
Something about Phase 2 had clearly rattled a fair few people, but without further information,

1177
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:28,600
one could only speculate.

1178
01:22:28,600 --> 01:22:32,920
Fortunately, we didn't need speculation, and the culprit decided to make himself known,

1179
01:22:32,920 --> 01:22:38,280
and it was none other than Jake's father, Greg Paul, who claimed to have uncovered the truth.

1180
01:22:38,280 --> 01:22:42,760
Yo, what's going on people? GP coming at you.

1181
01:22:42,760 --> 01:22:47,000
According to his subtweet, he had conducted an internal audit, and that he had seemingly

1182
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:51,800
uncovered details of financial recklessness, even implying some form of embezzlement?

1183
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:55,880
Nick Crompton wasn't happy with this, and angrily tweeted back that it wasn't the audit that people

1184
01:22:55,880 --> 01:22:59,960
had a problem with, it was about that Greg Paul was an all-round extremely unpleasant person to

1185
01:22:59,960 --> 01:23:02,360
deal with, and had next to no communication skills.

1186
01:23:02,360 --> 01:23:07,160
Greg was an interesting person to draft in, maybe because he would fundamentally run perpendicular

1187
01:23:07,160 --> 01:23:09,080
to those of Jake's loyal inner circle.

1188
01:23:09,080 --> 01:23:13,080
His only stakes are his son's wellbeing, and if he felt that people weren't doing their jobs right,

1189
01:23:13,080 --> 01:23:15,720
then he has very little to lose in being cutthroats.

1190
01:23:15,720 --> 01:23:20,840
But Jake Paul did. I don't know Team 10, I don't know if Greg had a point, but regardless of the

1191
01:23:20,840 --> 01:23:25,560
fingers and the pies, he had just fundamentally caused a departure of at least two of the team's

1192
01:23:25,560 --> 01:23:29,960
most influential figures. Regardless of their business practice, they still meant a lot to the

1193
01:23:29,960 --> 01:23:33,960
image of the team, and Nick Crompton's swift smackdown of Greg was probably the most indicative

1194
01:23:33,960 --> 01:23:36,360
of where public sentiment lay on it.

1195
01:23:36,360 --> 01:23:40,840
Greg may be an excellent businessman, but he is not a public figure, and his indirect gusting of

1196
01:23:40,840 --> 01:23:45,320
the team may have been a financially frugal move short term, but it had just jeopardised the future

1197
01:23:45,320 --> 01:23:47,720
of this phase, and one person knew it.

1198
01:23:47,720 --> 01:23:54,520
So, over the past couple of days, I'm sure you guys have seen, there's been members leaving Team 10.

1199
01:23:54,520 --> 01:24:01,960
INTRO

1200
01:24:01,960 --> 01:24:06,360
On the 13th of May, Jake Paul took to YouTube once more to upload a response to the sudden

1201
01:24:06,360 --> 01:24:11,800
departures of individuals, entitled, My Response and the Truth About Members Leaving Team 10.

1202
01:24:11,800 --> 01:24:16,680
As usual, it's placed on the typical vlogging escapades, however, unlike other responses and

1203
01:24:16,680 --> 01:24:20,840
sections, this part takes up two thirds of the video's runtime, and seems to have a rather

1204
01:24:20,840 --> 01:24:24,200
disparate tone to the rest of the content addressing these matters.

1205
01:24:24,200 --> 01:24:31,640
People's goals and things change, and sometimes that change causes people to grow apart from each

1206
01:24:31,640 --> 01:24:39,160
other, and for me, the way that I'm changing is I had bigger vision.

1207
01:24:39,160 --> 01:24:43,080
At a glance, his message doesn't seem particularly different, he goes for the spin that these people

1208
01:24:43,080 --> 01:24:47,080
leaving was actually a favourable outcome, it signified growth and progression for those

1209
01:24:47,080 --> 01:24:51,560
involved, and he personally welcomed that as, to him, change was an inherently positive force.

1210
01:24:51,560 --> 01:24:55,000
His explanation on the departure of certain members appears to align with that of Nick

1211
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:58,520
Crompton, that ultimately the trajectory of the team had been adjusted, and some members

1212
01:24:58,520 --> 01:25:02,520
felt like they didn't identify with those goals anymore. To him that was an acceptable discord,

1213
01:25:02,520 --> 01:25:07,480
but it was also irreconcilable in his mind, so the only option was to go their separate ways.

1214
01:25:07,480 --> 01:25:11,880
As the video, it once again plays into this idea that Jake Paul has all this planned out and under

1215
01:25:11,880 --> 01:25:16,360
control, his vision has become greater than that of those around him, and he is satisfied with the

1216
01:25:16,360 --> 01:25:21,400
outcome, even if he is sad to lose the company of some old friends. Jake Paul-"All of my energy

1217
01:25:22,440 --> 01:25:28,840
is focused on changing right now, and building the new, and going in a new direction, and

1218
01:25:28,840 --> 01:25:34,600
innovating, and being on top of the game." Nevertheless, this video was distinctly different

1219
01:25:34,680 --> 01:25:38,360
to other content that tackled disputes between the team and other creators. First of all,

1220
01:25:38,360 --> 01:25:42,440
gone were those who often flanked Jake, providing that sort of strength and reinforcement to what

1221
01:25:42,440 --> 01:25:46,280
he was saying. Second, gone were the cuts and edits that allowed Jake to make his narrative

1222
01:25:46,280 --> 01:25:49,720
as short and efficient as possible. However, most telling was the fact that although Jake

1223
01:25:49,720 --> 01:25:54,360
presented his perspective as one of the sepsis of confidence, his tone seemed surprisingly unsure

1224
01:25:54,360 --> 01:26:00,120
of itself and vulnerable. Jake-"Some of the people didn't necessarily agree with where I wanted to go,

1225
01:26:00,760 --> 01:26:09,240
or what my vision was. I totally respect that. I didn't want to persuade anybody into believing

1226
01:26:09,240 --> 01:26:18,200
in my vision. Sometimes my visions and ideas scare people because of how crazy they are."

1227
01:26:18,200 --> 01:26:22,200
Now, in a way, it makes some semblance of sense if Jake wishes to present a more authentic version

1228
01:26:22,200 --> 01:26:25,720
of himself when responding to this, but the uncertainty present as Jake rambles for

1229
01:26:25,720 --> 01:26:29,800
approximately 20 minutes is far more disconcerting than reassuring. At the same time,

1230
01:26:29,800 --> 01:26:33,800
as someone who's always seemed calculated with his content, there had to be something symbolic

1231
01:26:33,800 --> 01:26:37,960
about his choice to go it alone. He still has members of his team, and even a couple of his

1232
01:26:37,960 --> 01:26:42,360
inner circle that would readily back him up with these decisions. But maybe the truth was that

1233
01:26:42,360 --> 01:26:47,480
after such disruption, he didn't know who to trust anymore. Jake-"And as I was bringing on these

1234
01:26:47,480 --> 01:26:54,200
older business advisors and people to help me with my company, a couple of them advised me to

1235
01:26:54,840 --> 01:26:59,560
bring somebody on into my corner who wanted nothing else but to protect me,

1236
01:26:59,560 --> 01:27:06,120
who didn't care about my money, who I could 100% trust no matter what. And so the only person I

1237
01:27:06,120 --> 01:27:12,040
could think of, the only person that is right for that job was my dad. Not to run my businesses and

1238
01:27:12,040 --> 01:27:22,120
be in charge, but to simply look over the shoulders of other people who were in my businesses,

1239
01:27:22,120 --> 01:27:29,320
who I'm entrusting to run my business, because I knew my dad would have my best interests at heart."

1240
01:27:29,320 --> 01:27:33,400
The video was a rather futile show of strength. He emphasized the need to have people who shared

1241
01:27:33,400 --> 01:27:37,320
his vision around him, but the problem was, if he didn't have enough people supporting that vision,

1242
01:27:37,320 --> 01:27:41,720
how was he going to make it there? I don't think he knew exactly. Jake-"I have big goals. Like,

1243
01:27:42,840 --> 01:27:49,160
I really, really have found recently that I am so passionate about music. And again,

1244
01:27:49,160 --> 01:27:55,960
I just want to surround myself with people, again, who have way more experience than me,

1245
01:27:55,960 --> 01:28:02,200
who have way more relationships than me, who have tasted victory and business success in this

1246
01:28:02,200 --> 01:28:07,080
industry." In June, Jake attempted to launch a live show fittingly called Team 10 Live. However,

1247
01:28:07,080 --> 01:28:11,000
by now it was clear that the team was looking rather emaciated. Although no announcement of

1248
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:15,000
departure had been made, brothers Nathan and Cade Spicer were not present at any of these shows,

1249
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:19,000
causing many to assume that they had also made their exits, and leaving Jake Paul's squad with

1250
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:23,080
six members, which other commentators were more than happy to point out. The narrative

1251
01:28:23,080 --> 01:28:26,760
was no longer that Team 10 were the worst collective to grace people's computer screens,

1252
01:28:26,760 --> 01:28:29,880
it was that they were dying, and they were not sure what to do about it.

1253
01:28:31,080 --> 01:28:37,320
There's a pretty beautiful irony in the fact that more than half of Team 10's most iconic song

1254
01:28:37,320 --> 01:28:42,840
is performed by people that are no longer in Team 10. For some reason on the website it says,

1255
01:28:42,840 --> 01:28:48,200
Team 10 tour 2018, as if to suggest that there will be more tours in the future.

1256
01:28:49,080 --> 01:28:55,560
I just can't imagine a world where that happens. I think this was a one and done kind of deal,

1257
01:28:55,560 --> 01:28:59,000
and if it is, I guess I'm happy I got to be a part of history.

1258
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:03,000
Over the next few months, Team 10 continued to falter and stagnate, and although Jake expressed

1259
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:07,400
no hostility towards former members in his May upload, as summer 2018 approached its end,

1260
01:29:07,400 --> 01:29:11,400
Paul's attitude towards those who had left Team 10 behind appeared increasingly bitter.

1261
01:29:11,400 --> 01:29:16,520
No, I think if you think about it, if Team 10 were together right now,

1262
01:29:18,040 --> 01:29:21,640
it would be bigger than the Kardashians.

1263
01:29:21,640 --> 01:29:25,320
First of all, on True Geordie's podcast where he claimed that Team 10 had the potential to be as

1264
01:29:25,320 --> 01:29:29,080
big as the Kardashians, which is a strange statement to make about a group of people

1265
01:29:29,080 --> 01:29:33,000
who you insisted that its whole purpose was to incubate towns and let people go whenever

1266
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:37,240
you felt like it, and yet in spite of all this, Jake still had a spin, claiming that it was those

1267
01:29:37,240 --> 01:29:39,320
who left who were the real failures.

1268
01:29:39,320 --> 01:29:45,240
Till this day, I haven't made a single dollar off of Team 10. I've only invested my own money

1269
01:29:45,240 --> 01:29:50,520
into it to make it successful. And they're like, oh, like, you owe me this, you dah, dah, dah,

1270
01:29:50,520 --> 01:29:59,000
like, dah, dah, dah. Like, there's so much like back and forth, and it's all I wanted to do is

1271
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:05,640
create a platform for people to like accomplish their dreams. And a lot of them have, but they

1272
01:30:05,640 --> 01:30:11,240
still don't, they don't, I don't think they realize like what they had until it was gone.

1273
01:30:11,240 --> 01:30:16,200
Those people needed Jake to succeed, and now he's sure they're realizing the errors of their ways.

1274
01:30:16,200 --> 01:30:18,520
Why don't they just come crawling back already?

1275
01:30:18,520 --> 01:30:27,160
And I think like, as we've seen like members leave Team 10, you see them all turn into nothing,

1276
01:30:27,160 --> 01:30:34,680
and make mistakes, and fumble, and then I think they're like, oh shit, like,

1277
01:30:35,800 --> 01:30:39,800
maybe what I had was amazing.

1278
01:30:39,800 --> 01:30:43,080
This perspective was reiterated in Shane Dawson's Jake Paul series,

1279
01:30:43,080 --> 01:30:46,040
where Jake once again claims that those who left had used him.

1280
01:30:46,040 --> 01:30:48,920
I'd say like everyone who's left has used us.

1281
01:30:48,920 --> 01:30:52,920
Yeah, because they think they can go on and do something better, and then it's like...

1282
01:30:52,920 --> 01:30:58,040
I don't think they realize that they like used us, but when these people come into Team 10,

1283
01:30:58,040 --> 01:30:59,480
I give them everything.

1284
01:30:59,480 --> 01:31:03,480
Now, maybe they did, maybe they didn't, but the truth of the matter was that Jake Paul's shift

1285
01:31:03,480 --> 01:31:07,560
in tone signified that his perspective had shifted, before he was looking for reasons

1286
01:31:07,560 --> 01:31:11,880
why Team 10 would still be successful, and how actually everything was going according to plan.

1287
01:31:11,880 --> 01:31:15,480
Now, though he's too proud to admit it at the time, he had clearly come to terms with the fact

1288
01:31:15,480 --> 01:31:19,640
that Team 10 was failing, and he was looking for people to blame, but as the person who proclaimed

1289
01:31:19,640 --> 01:31:24,120
that they had the final say, the buck stopped at him, and he seemed incapable of tending to

1290
01:31:24,120 --> 01:31:28,600
the continued bleeding of numbers, some of whom even warned him that this scenario would repeat

1291
01:31:28,600 --> 01:31:33,400
itself. At first Jake lost a couple members he was able to replace fairly easily, even perhaps

1292
01:31:33,400 --> 01:31:37,240
enhancing the crew, then he lost a few more members who ultimately left a mark with viewers

1293
01:31:37,240 --> 01:31:42,120
who cared about them and invested their emotions and finances into the group, but finally he lost

1294
01:31:42,120 --> 01:31:46,600
integral members who he cared about and trusted more than he was prepared to admit, and members

1295
01:31:46,600 --> 01:31:50,920
that he was unable to replenish and admit back into his inner circle. Jake's team remained at

1296
01:31:50,920 --> 01:31:55,080
a roster of six for the summer, and the start of autumn, but come mid-October during Shane

1297
01:31:55,080 --> 01:31:59,640
Dawson's documentary series, the fate of Team 10 would be decided once and for all.

1298
01:31:59,640 --> 01:32:17,480
I suppose we should talk about the Shane Dawson documentary for a moment,

1299
01:32:17,480 --> 01:32:20,120
as there is the significance of its relationship with Team 10.

1300
01:32:20,120 --> 01:32:26,840
I just feel like I was like a pawn in like their game like they're always trying to one-up

1301
01:32:26,840 --> 01:32:33,320
each other always like so like I was just like a goal like I was

1302
01:32:34,680 --> 01:32:41,720
just used the whole time in Team 10 in videos and Logan's videos and everyone's I was just like

1303
01:32:42,920 --> 01:32:46,600
I don't know it was like they're playing a game and they're like the chess masters or whatever

1304
01:32:46,680 --> 01:32:48,680
and I was just a little fun.

1305
01:32:50,920 --> 01:32:53,800
Throughout the series, there were a variety of interviews with former members who had left under

1306
01:32:53,800 --> 01:32:58,520
certain circumstances, and there were occasional revelations that added context to past situations,

1307
01:32:58,520 --> 01:33:02,760
including that Alyssa Violet had slept with Logan Paul, Nick Crompton claiming all the pranks were

1308
01:33:02,760 --> 01:33:06,920
fake, and Jake alleging that Chance Sutton had stolen a joint account from him. These potentially

1309
01:33:06,920 --> 01:33:11,240
added context to previous scenarios and maybe gave Jake more footing to respond to them. Throughout

1310
01:33:11,240 --> 01:33:15,080
the series, there had been emphasis on Jake's relationship with past and present members within

1311
01:33:15,080 --> 01:33:19,000
Team 10. There were many questions swirling on how the depleted team were going to emerge from

1312
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:23,480
this. While so many rumours surrounded their future, they would receive an answer very soon.

1313
01:33:23,480 --> 01:33:28,280
On October 18th, although no formal announcement was made, all of Team 10's socials were wiped

1314
01:33:28,280 --> 01:33:32,840
completely, with a message posted on their now inactive Instagram that a new team would be coming

1315
01:33:32,840 --> 01:33:37,160
soon. At the time, this news was taken with a grain of salt by many following the situation at hand,

1316
01:33:37,160 --> 01:33:41,400
partly because this coincided with the climax of Shane Dawson's documentary series, with many

1317
01:33:41,400 --> 01:33:45,240
assuming it to be a marketing plot to promote whatever Jake had planned. It's a reasonable

1318
01:33:45,240 --> 01:33:49,240
theory, because it almost certainly would have worked, and Jake seemed to be taking aim at former

1319
01:33:49,240 --> 01:33:53,000
members of the house again on social media. But as the final episode of this show aired,

1320
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:57,000
people didn't exactly receive what they expected. It featured Shane sitting down with Jake,

1321
01:33:57,000 --> 01:34:01,160
asking the questions, and allowing Mr Paul to respond to nearly every major controversy

1322
01:34:01,160 --> 01:34:05,080
that featured himself in Team 10, many of which he never fully addressed at the time,

1323
01:34:05,080 --> 01:34:07,560
including those involving present and former members.

1324
01:34:25,640 --> 01:34:29,080
There are a lot of ways to interpret his responses, some of which you will not find

1325
01:34:29,080 --> 01:34:33,560
satisfactory, as he does hold steadfast on points that many people feel strongly about,

1326
01:34:33,560 --> 01:34:37,400
such as the claims made by the Martinez twins, which Jake dismisses as banter.

1327
01:34:37,960 --> 01:34:42,200
On other situations, like his relationship with Alyssa Violet, Jake seems more contrite,

1328
01:34:42,200 --> 01:34:46,120
admitting that her affair with Logan was only a response to their own toxic relationship.

1329
01:34:46,120 --> 01:34:50,040
He navigates a variety of situations with different levels of defiance and remorse,

1330
01:34:50,040 --> 01:34:53,240
even making a statement by deleting their face bank to upload on video.

1331
01:34:53,240 --> 01:35:06,120
However, probably the most relevant details are the plans that Jake has for his future.

1332
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:12,920
For me, that's why I want to completely disconnect from all of this social media shit right now,

1333
01:35:12,920 --> 01:35:17,720
is to figure that out. What do I really like to do? What do I really want to do?

1334
01:35:17,720 --> 01:35:21,640
What's next for me? It's like you said, it's like starting over.

1335
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:27,320
There is a sense that, at this moment, Jake had already made up his mind on the fate of Team 10,

1336
01:35:27,320 --> 01:35:30,280
and although this upload followed the wiping of their social media presence,

1337
01:35:30,280 --> 01:35:34,440
it was recorded before and almost served as a retrospective justification of itself.

1338
01:35:34,440 --> 01:35:38,680
The only significant detail that seemed to imply otherwise was this idea that a new Team 10 was in

1339
01:35:38,680 --> 01:35:42,920
the works. How could Jake walk away from something saying he didn't want another Leaving Team 10

1340
01:35:42,920 --> 01:35:47,240
video, but still wanted another Team 10? How could you have one without the other?

1341
01:35:47,240 --> 01:35:50,760
It was hard to look at this and not expect another Team 10 almost immediately after the

1342
01:35:50,760 --> 01:35:54,600
conclusion of this series, and barely a month after the disbandment of Team 10,

1343
01:35:54,600 --> 01:35:59,720
Jake Paul posted a tweet that read, Season 3, November 25th. This led to many online

1344
01:35:59,720 --> 01:36:03,400
concluding that this was the next roster. It made sense as Jake had retained ownership of

1345
01:36:03,400 --> 01:36:07,320
the Team 10 house, with a few people even moving in. However, when the date came around,

1346
01:36:07,320 --> 01:36:09,800
people got something very different to what they were expecting.

1347
01:36:10,440 --> 01:36:15,000
For the past, like, month or so, Erika and I's relationship has been, like, super rocky.

1348
01:36:15,560 --> 01:36:19,400
Like I said, it turned into this, like, downward spiral where we were just, like,

1349
01:36:19,400 --> 01:36:23,960
super super toxic for each other, and we, like, know everything about each other,

1350
01:36:23,960 --> 01:36:30,520
and, like, we know how to hurt each other, and it's so sad that it got to that point, but it did.

1351
01:36:33,480 --> 01:36:38,120
Season 3 was, in fact, another documentary-style series which covered Jake Paul himself,

1352
01:36:38,120 --> 01:36:42,440
his personal life, and his relationship with Erika Costell. It had been announced a few weeks

1353
01:36:42,440 --> 01:36:45,960
prior that they had broken up, and Jake had teased the reasons for this on his channel,

1354
01:36:45,960 --> 01:36:49,400
but in the end, what people received was a two-episode drama fest which Jake Paul

1355
01:36:49,400 --> 01:36:53,960
discontinued for being too real. There was no prominent mention of Team 10, just Jake and a

1356
01:36:53,960 --> 01:36:58,200
bunch of his friends trying to navigate the waters, a relationship that was beyond saving.

1357
01:36:58,200 --> 01:37:01,640
Over the next few months, it's seen that Jake Paul was quietly taking apart the constructs

1358
01:37:01,640 --> 01:37:05,640
that he had built Team 10 on previously, and had something else in mind, but nobody was sure what

1359
01:37:05,640 --> 01:37:10,120
at this point. Jake Paul himself was in and out of the news, but for no particular reason other than

1360
01:37:10,120 --> 01:37:11,480
it being Jake Paul.

1361
01:37:11,480 --> 01:37:15,640
Jake Paul- Go to mysterybrand.net if you want to win some mystery boxes,

1362
01:37:15,640 --> 01:37:18,120
this video was so much fun, thank you so much for watching, I love you guys,

1363
01:37:18,120 --> 01:37:19,800
and I will see you tomorrow with another video, peace!

1364
01:37:19,800 --> 01:37:22,840
Jake Paul- This has got to be one of the worst things I've seen on YouTube, simply because his

1365
01:37:22,840 --> 01:37:25,320
fans are so young and so impressionable.

1366
01:37:25,320 --> 01:37:28,120
There were crickets for months until a February vlog titled

1367
01:37:28,120 --> 01:37:32,520
Dear YouTube, I've Been Hiding This From You, when Jake began opening up on the reasons why

1368
01:37:32,520 --> 01:37:34,280
Team 10 was brought to an end.

1369
01:37:34,280 --> 01:37:38,120
Jake Paul- A lot of the reason why Team 10 started to fall apart is because I wasn't able to connect

1370
01:37:38,120 --> 01:37:44,200
with a lot of the members as people, and so I didn't understand or I wasn't able to judge

1371
01:37:44,200 --> 01:37:47,640
whether they were good people or not, because I just was like, business, business, everyone's

1372
01:37:47,640 --> 01:37:51,800
gonna win, everyone's gonna grow and do amazing stuff, and then you come to find out and you see

1373
01:37:51,800 --> 01:37:58,040
bad traits and bad qualities in people. I also wasn't mature enough to be able to understand

1374
01:37:58,040 --> 01:38:03,960
feelings and love and emotions and stuff like that, because I just got looped into business

1375
01:38:03,960 --> 01:38:05,960
when I was 16 years old.

1376
01:38:05,960 --> 01:38:09,480
What was said in this video wasn't necessarily a surprise, and seemed to line up with the

1377
01:38:09,480 --> 01:38:13,400
observations that could be made towards the end of its time in the spotlight. Jake possessed

1378
01:38:13,400 --> 01:38:17,400
serious trust issues with members and couldn't reconcile them. He felt like he couldn't continue

1379
01:38:17,400 --> 01:38:21,720
this knowing who people really were, and thus he felt the only option was to bring the famous

1380
01:38:21,720 --> 01:38:26,520
and infamous crew to an end. It appeared that this time there was no grand scheme, no immediate

1381
01:38:26,520 --> 01:38:33,080
reboot, no hilarious prank, this is the way that Team 10 had ended. Not with a bang, but a whimper.

1382
01:38:33,080 --> 01:38:37,240
And to be honest, I think that's always how Jake Paul saw it as ending, he never enjoyed the

1383
01:38:37,240 --> 01:38:41,960
narrative of a dramatic collapse, he'd much prefer to end a project quietly and move on to the next

1384
01:38:41,960 --> 01:38:46,440
one. Maybe that was the play, to leave everyone expecting something that wasn't coming.

1385
01:38:46,440 --> 01:38:51,240
Jake Paul-"And that's like where there was kind of like a disconnect with a lot of the Team 10

1386
01:38:51,240 --> 01:38:55,640
members, and even with like my best friend like Chance for example, it was just like this weird

1387
01:38:55,640 --> 01:38:59,800
thing for all of us to get used to, and we weren't able to get used to it, so that's where a lot of

1388
01:38:59,800 --> 01:39:04,920
like weird stuff came from." But of course, he doesn't normally talk about something without reason,

1389
01:39:04,920 --> 01:39:09,240
and at this point, the conversation takes a turn once more towards Jake's future plans,

1390
01:39:09,240 --> 01:39:11,480
revealing what was indeed coming up.

1391
01:39:17,160 --> 01:39:23,000
Jake Paul-"I'm in a position, I'm 22 years old now, and who I want to be and where I see myself being

1392
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:27,240
a couple years from now is very different than what I'm doing now." In his video, Jake seemed to

1393
01:39:27,240 --> 01:39:31,880
reflect on the failure of Team 10 as a result of too many emotionally immature people under one

1394
01:39:31,880 --> 01:39:36,200
roof. It's hard to know how exactly he's grown from this, but one might say that age and experience

1395
01:39:36,200 --> 01:39:40,760
is its own form of maturity. Responding to a question asked by a fan, he seems confident that

1396
01:39:40,760 --> 01:39:45,080
the next Team 10 will not be caught by the pitfalls that the previous one was, promising that

1397
01:39:45,080 --> 01:39:50,760
it will be bigger and better than ever. Jake Paul-"We are working on a new Team 10 guys, we're still

1398
01:39:50,760 --> 01:39:56,200
figuring it out, it's still very early stages, but I love Team 10, it's a genius idea, it creates like

1399
01:39:56,200 --> 01:40:01,960
such an amazing vibe in the videos, and I want to bring that vibe back, and know that when I do

1400
01:40:01,960 --> 01:40:06,040
bring it back, it's going to be better than ever, and it will be bigger than ever, and it's just

1401
01:40:06,040 --> 01:40:10,520
gonna be smarter and well done, and I learned from my mistakes in the past, and I want you guys to

1402
01:40:10,520 --> 01:40:15,480
just trust me as I rebuild the Team 10 that it's gonna be dope." However, otherwise, it didn't seem

1403
01:40:15,480 --> 01:40:19,640
like Jake was planning on changing too much, committing to the vibes that had made the previous

1404
01:40:19,640 --> 01:40:23,480
one a success. As you noted in this video, it was still in its early stages, and other than

1405
01:40:23,480 --> 01:40:28,920
Jake Paul offering an internment, I mean internship, that would be paid in fun, there wouldn't be much

1406
01:40:28,920 --> 01:40:33,240
public development on this until the end of May, where a trailer was posted on Jake Paul's channel

1407
01:40:33,240 --> 01:40:40,040
foreshadowing the new Team 10, and how they would be presented. Jake Paul-"People don't understand

1408
01:40:40,040 --> 01:40:44,360
how hard it is to rebuild this company, the pressures, the shit that's on my plate, I don't have

1409
01:40:44,360 --> 01:40:50,280
a roadmap in front of me of how to do this shit, and it's fucking stressful." This seemed to take

1410
01:40:50,280 --> 01:40:54,680
inspiration from the cancelled Jake Paul and Cut series from November, and they also mostly erased

1411
01:40:54,680 --> 01:40:59,240
from the internet to Team 10 TV, which involved the original members. It seemed to focus more on

1412
01:40:59,240 --> 01:41:04,280
this dramatic portrayal of Team 10 under the guise of reality. It was a bit unclear what exactly the

1413
01:41:04,280 --> 01:41:08,680
show was going to be at this point, but there was a focus on Jake Paul and his then girlfriend Tana

1414
01:41:08,680 --> 01:41:13,000
Moncho, who had recently gone public with their relationship. Tana's involvement would be confirmed

1415
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:17,800
a week later with a video posted onto Team 10's channel titled, Tana is joining Team 10.

1416
01:41:17,800 --> 01:41:21,560
Unfortunately, I can't say too much else about the video because it seems to be lost to time.

1417
01:41:21,560 --> 01:41:26,840
However, on June the 1st, Jake Paul posted Meet The New Team 10, introducing his new entourage to

1418
01:41:26,840 --> 01:41:37,320
the entire world. Jake Paul-"The problem is, it's hard to find actual good Team 10 talent

1419
01:41:38,280 --> 01:41:46,280
who work hard, want to be here, don't have egos, have a talent, have the right look, are the right

1420
01:41:46,280 --> 01:41:52,440
age. It's like there's almost like no way to find them." There are a variety of intro reels for these

1421
01:41:52,440 --> 01:41:56,760
people who many will know barely anything about. Lots of clips of them going about their lives in

1422
01:41:56,760 --> 01:42:01,160
the sort of shaky cam drama that many people who are interested in reality TV will be all too

1423
01:42:01,160 --> 01:42:19,640
familiar with. It seems Jake wants to embrace the chaos and make it part of what Team 10 is known

1424
01:42:19,640 --> 01:42:23,480
for. Whereas in the past, Jake attempted to control the narrative surrounding his squad,

1425
01:42:23,480 --> 01:42:27,800
here he wants the narratives to create themselves from the authentic interactions between figures

1426
01:42:27,800 --> 01:42:32,040
within the house. The roster of members appeared to be more mature this time, including the couple

1427
01:42:32,040 --> 01:42:36,440
Tram and Core, whose son Tidus would regularly make appearances on Jake Paul's channel as well.

1428
01:42:36,440 --> 01:42:40,440
In his February video, Jake stated he was trying to reconcile his maturing audience,

1429
01:42:40,440 --> 01:42:45,000
the reality show style seemed to be the solution. On principle, it seemed like a good idea. One of

1430
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:49,400
the greatest conflicts from within Team 10 was that the group often appeared blindsided by drama

1431
01:42:49,400 --> 01:42:53,720
and tension. Team 10's proclamations of strength and good vibes were often undermined by people

1432
01:42:53,720 --> 01:42:58,520
stating otherwise in exit videos. In this case, the drama would be integrated into Team 10,

1433
01:42:58,520 --> 01:43:02,840
there would be negativity and suspense, and if someone left and said the atmosphere was toxic,

1434
01:43:02,840 --> 01:43:07,640
people would just say, well we've been new, we've watched the episode. This was Jake Paul's attempt

1435
01:43:07,640 --> 01:43:12,360
to reclaim the drama that had taken so much from him, it was the chance to have a say on his own

1436
01:43:12,360 --> 01:43:17,400
character before other people did, and he was successful in that way, but it was still a very,

1437
01:43:17,400 --> 01:43:18,840
very mixed blessing.

1438
01:43:18,840 --> 01:43:23,640
You know that like, I'm business oriented, and I'm just getting straight to the fucking facts, like,

1439
01:43:23,640 --> 01:43:27,800
yeah we're friends, but like with that shit, it's just straight to the facts, like, that's disgusting,

1440
01:43:27,800 --> 01:43:32,920
like, you need to delete it, and here's why, and I don't want this drama, I don't have time for this

1441
01:43:32,920 --> 01:43:39,080
drama, like, I hate having to babysit, but it's part of what we need to do with this new Team 10,

1442
01:43:39,080 --> 01:43:44,760
because in the old one, there was no communication, and no, no one really actually managing what was

1443
01:43:44,920 --> 01:43:45,640
going on.

1444
01:43:45,640 --> 01:43:51,320
Jake's attempts to blend the personal and the business side on a public forum made sense in a way,

1445
01:43:51,320 --> 01:43:55,400
because it allowed people to see the often flawed process that individuals have as humans, and the

1446
01:43:55,400 --> 01:44:00,120
failings that occur along the way. How that perspective was at the expense of any actual interest

1447
01:44:00,120 --> 01:44:04,680
from most people outside the immediate audience, it played out more like something you'd see on a rather

1448
01:44:04,680 --> 01:44:09,320
tabloid cable channel rather than actual YouTube content. Viewership on each of these videos was a

1449
01:44:09,320 --> 01:44:14,120
few million, and although many of these viewers seemed interested, a lot just weren't even bothering

1450
01:44:14,120 --> 01:44:18,600
to click on them. Jake having full control of these aspects made the content unappealing, and

1451
01:44:18,600 --> 01:44:23,240
dampened the conflict, limiting the actual reach of videos. In fact, the only major drama that was

1452
01:44:23,240 --> 01:44:27,320
reported on by sources outside of Jake Paul in the first month of this airing was when a pair

1453
01:44:27,320 --> 01:44:31,320
of transgender women revealed they were kicked out of the house for their gender identity. You didn't

1454
01:44:31,320 --> 01:44:35,960
see that in the Team 10 uncut, did you? It played into this perception that this was still highly

1455
01:44:35,960 --> 01:44:37,240
processed content.

1456
01:44:38,200 --> 01:44:42,920
So do you want your room, or do you want to finish the conversation? Where do you want to go? Do you

1457
01:44:42,920 --> 01:44:46,440
want to end this on a good communicative term, or what?

1458
01:44:46,440 --> 01:44:51,960
It's over, Jake. I've got an argument with you. We're on Team 10 uncut. I don't give a fuck. I'm

1459
01:44:51,960 --> 01:44:54,920
hooked by sin, but we're letting you on the new land.

1460
01:44:54,920 --> 01:44:59,000
People didn't trust this sort of candid media from Jake, because people didn't trust him.

1461
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:02,760
Additionally, it lacked the chemistry and dynamics that the original Team 10 possessed. There was

1462
01:45:02,760 --> 01:45:06,600
nothing wrong with these people, but at the same time, the reality style aspect really

1463
01:45:06,600 --> 01:45:10,840
sapped the personality from these individuals, many of whom could never recreate the energy of

1464
01:45:10,840 --> 01:45:15,240
a Martinez or a Chance, and I can't believe I'm even saying that. Almost as soon as Jake Paul

1465
01:45:15,240 --> 01:45:20,040
went back to posting normal content with Tana and a few others, his views jumped up significantly.

1466
01:45:20,040 --> 01:45:24,120
This led them to try merging these two together with a video clip baiting a couple's fight,

1467
01:45:24,120 --> 01:45:28,600
but even that couldn't inspire mass viewership. Episode 11 was released over a month and a half

1468
01:45:28,600 --> 01:45:33,560
later to a rather underwhelming response, and despite the promise of season 2, Team 10 uncut

1469
01:45:33,560 --> 01:45:38,360
was quietly ushered off the channel after 11 episodes, with normal content resuming soon

1470
01:45:38,360 --> 01:45:42,920
after. The last video uploaded to the Team 10 channel was on the 21st July 2019, which

1471
01:45:42,920 --> 01:45:47,400
appears to feature a reduced roster and an energy that was somewhat subdued. Maybe Jake knew that

1472
01:45:47,400 --> 01:45:58,680
finally, this time, it was the end of the line. Jake Paul had taken an extensive break to

1473
01:45:58,680 --> 01:46:03,000
recalibrate and rebuild Team 10 from the ground up. He had invested a lot of time and energy into

1474
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:08,120
making this one of his most finely tuned ventures on his channel yet, but people weren't fighting.

1475
01:46:08,120 --> 01:46:12,600
I doubt many people even knew there was a second Team 10. Although Jake never officially brought

1476
01:46:12,600 --> 01:46:16,920
it to an end, stating in interviews that more would be coming soon, his plans for the crew

1477
01:46:16,920 --> 01:46:21,800
never really re-emerged, and although he kept some members around, Team 10 itself

1478
01:46:22,360 --> 01:46:25,640
was effectively over. Team 10 was dead.

1479
01:46:33,080 --> 01:46:37,480
There were continued hints and allusions by Jake Paul that Team 10 would eventually return,

1480
01:46:37,480 --> 01:46:41,320
but as I mentioned earlier, there has been no follow through on such, and any social media

1481
01:46:41,320 --> 01:46:45,560
presence they previously possessed has been mostly erased, including their channel which Jake has

1482
01:46:45,560 --> 01:46:50,920
now transformed into his Boxing Center podcast, BS with Jake Paul. Probably the most indicative

1483
01:46:50,920 --> 01:46:55,400
sign that Team 10 was a done deal was the fact that Jake Paul sold his house in 2021,

1484
01:46:55,400 --> 01:46:59,720
stating that he intended to move out of LA and focus on his mission to become the greatest

1485
01:46:59,720 --> 01:47:04,520
prize fighter in the world. In that sense, such an entourage may hold him back. It also didn't help

1486
01:47:04,520 --> 01:47:09,000
that in the years following its cessation, Team 10's legacy has been marred by continued claims

1487
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:13,240
of extremely improper and unprofessional behaviour, coming from people who were formerly associated

1488
01:47:13,240 --> 01:47:17,640
with the group, and even people who weren't. These are not like claims, and in certain industries

1489
01:47:17,720 --> 01:47:22,440
would be taken very seriously, but Jake Paul is like a proverbial steamroller for his brand,

1490
01:47:22,440 --> 01:47:27,880
and his responses either amount to no response or threatening to sue. Jake doesn't care, I doubt he

1491
01:47:27,880 --> 01:47:33,000
ever will, but as far as Team 10 is concerned, he seems happier without them now, and I have a hunch

1492
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:37,320
the feeling is mutual. Most former members appear to have found some success in the careers they've

1493
01:47:37,320 --> 01:47:41,480
decided to pursue, with a couple like the Dobres even staying in the clickbait game.

1494
01:47:41,480 --> 01:47:45,800
It's a testament to the sort of environment that we were living in 2017 that Team 10 existed,

1495
01:47:45,800 --> 01:47:49,400
and how they were treated by the public in general. It made sense there was this contempt

1496
01:47:49,400 --> 01:47:53,640
for them given their behaviour, but very few people really looked beyond that at the time.

1497
01:47:53,640 --> 01:47:58,520
I've heard people say that they missed the 2017 drama when it felt less serious, but the claims

1498
01:47:58,520 --> 01:48:02,600
weren't less serious, it's just the way people treated them were. The prevailing narrative was

1499
01:48:02,600 --> 01:48:06,600
that Team 10 is annoying, obnoxious, and therefore bad, and don't get me wrong, they're not good

1500
01:48:06,600 --> 01:48:11,080
things to be, but over time, the concerns relating to a group like that became greater and greater,

1501
01:48:11,080 --> 01:48:15,160
and their reputation, although not given much thought since, would likely sour in the public

1502
01:48:15,240 --> 01:48:19,160
mind or review. Is there anything vaguely positive at all that one can say about them?

1503
01:48:19,160 --> 01:48:22,760
Jake, it's every day bro, peace, peace bro, we're all dead.

1504
01:48:22,760 --> 01:48:27,240
There have been creator houses before, but none popularised the idea like Team 10,

1505
01:48:27,240 --> 01:48:31,160
and I don't believe it was just the luck of the draw, it was obviously highly calculated,

1506
01:48:31,160 --> 01:48:35,400
and at the core was a strong business mind who knew how to market himself and others in the form

1507
01:48:35,400 --> 01:48:40,280
of Jake Paul, an individual simultaneously able to be a successful public figure and a business one

1508
01:48:40,280 --> 01:48:44,360
required a lot of skills, and Jake Paul demonstrated that he could do either in creating

1509
01:48:44,360 --> 01:48:48,600
Team 10. The challenge came with actually balancing them, and trying to navigate interpersonal

1510
01:48:48,600 --> 01:48:52,440
relationships alongside them, which was a challenge given that Jake Paul seems like a bit

1511
01:48:52,440 --> 01:48:57,080
of a toxic person, an observation that became evident to many over time. We'll talk more about

1512
01:48:57,080 --> 01:49:02,360
him personally in a bit, but for the team itself to succeed, it needed a lot more than it had.

1513
01:49:02,360 --> 01:49:06,520
Hey, hey, this is my vlog channel, get the f*** out of the camera. Hey man, this is my vlog channel.

1514
01:49:06,520 --> 01:49:11,400
On the surface, Team 10's real success was lasting as long as they did, from the It's Every Day Bro

1515
01:49:11,400 --> 01:49:15,480
music video, and all the uploads, drum, and controversy that followed it. I have not been

1516
01:49:15,480 --> 01:49:19,160
able to go into detail about a lot of it because this video would have been so much longer than

1517
01:49:19,160 --> 01:49:23,560
planned, but the group was a ticking time bomb that could have resulted in much worse than it did.

1518
01:49:23,560 --> 01:49:28,040
Nick Crompton would dismiss prank content as fake to try and make it seem more inconsequential,

1519
01:49:28,040 --> 01:49:31,960
and to possibly counter those claims that these japes cause visible harm, but regardless of how

1520
01:49:31,960 --> 01:49:36,200
much of it was planned, there was tangibly a real element to it, and in trying to fulfil that sort

1521
01:49:36,200 --> 01:49:40,280
of YouTube insanity image, there were multiple times when the project could have just imploded

1522
01:49:40,280 --> 01:49:45,320
dramatically and given Jake the PR nightmare that he dreaded, so many close calls. Team 10

1523
01:49:45,320 --> 01:49:49,640
delicately walked the line of what was acceptable content to upload onto YouTube, and one can't help

1524
01:49:49,640 --> 01:49:53,560
but wonder if they would have crossed it if Jake's brother hadn't done so before. The off-camera

1525
01:49:53,560 --> 01:49:57,800
lifestyle of Team 10 was often reported in a rather unflattering light too, and yes, in a way

1526
01:49:57,800 --> 01:50:01,560
it can't be surprising that Jake Paul seemingly created a frat house environment, but a lot of

1527
01:50:01,560 --> 01:50:06,040
members didn't sign up to that, especially considering factors like background and age.

1528
01:50:06,040 --> 01:50:10,040
It was not something that everyone would have been happy to be a part of, but they didn't feel like

1529
01:50:10,040 --> 01:50:14,440
they had a say. Additionally, the general claims of individual maltreatment of those within the

1530
01:50:14,440 --> 01:50:18,760
house after they left were damning in their own right. It's obviously hard to evaluate the verity

1531
01:50:18,760 --> 01:50:23,240
of every last claim, but Jake seldom sought to deny a lot of them, he often dismissed or downplayed

1532
01:50:23,240 --> 01:50:27,800
them as misunderstandings and banter that had gone wrong, yet even if that was the case, it underlined

1533
01:50:27,800 --> 01:50:31,960
a fundamental problem of having something like Team 10 and what they offered, this idea that they

1534
01:50:31,960 --> 01:50:36,520
could take a smaller, inexperienced, often younger creator and grow their channel, but with one

1535
01:50:36,600 --> 01:50:39,960
massive condition, which is that you have to tolerate this group of people who are more

1536
01:50:39,960 --> 01:50:43,800
influential than you. You have to live in their house, and you have to deal with their antics.

1537
01:50:43,800 --> 01:50:48,120
Maybe nothing was designed with malice or intent to exploit, but Jake implicitly created an

1538
01:50:48,120 --> 01:50:52,600
environment that individuals would inherently feel rather trapped in. A brief read of a psychological

1539
01:50:52,600 --> 01:50:56,440
study on conformity and compliance would have told you that what they were creating could never

1540
01:50:56,440 --> 01:51:00,920
function healthily, but it kept happening. The greater problem with this environment is when

1541
01:51:00,920 --> 01:51:05,240
someone does decide to depart, it's always more dramatic. Leaving Team 10 videos didn't just

1542
01:51:05,240 --> 01:51:09,240
manifest as a trend because they were a fun thing to make, they existed because individuals

1543
01:51:09,240 --> 01:51:13,480
found their personal feelings caught up in this space that they felt trapped in, they'd crafted

1544
01:51:13,480 --> 01:51:17,560
a relationship with an audience who felt like they were a part of the team and that leaving would be

1545
01:51:17,560 --> 01:51:21,960
a betrayal of sorts, something that core members would occasionally refer to. These videos weren't

1546
01:51:21,960 --> 01:51:26,680
solely created as a way to attack Team 10, it was a way to rationalise their own decision to the

1547
01:51:26,680 --> 01:51:31,480
outside world. Every exit video felt like a stab to the Team 10 image, and yet every time they

1548
01:51:31,480 --> 01:51:35,000
persisted, while proclaiming that they knew exactly what they were doing. If they knew what

1549
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:38,680
they were doing, then they'd know that they were trying to trap smaller creators in a collective

1550
01:51:38,680 --> 01:51:42,520
by offering them more influence and making it contingent on living in a house with a commitment

1551
01:51:42,520 --> 01:51:47,640
to millions of fans. But maybe Jake did know what he was doing, maybe he wanted to create a Team 10

1552
01:51:47,640 --> 01:51:51,720
that was fully submissive and under his thumb. Some people had noted his controlling nature,

1553
01:51:51,720 --> 01:51:56,760
he's a businessman and clearly has the ability to be methodical. He knew that if he had a consistent

1554
01:51:56,760 --> 01:52:01,320
roster that didn't feel like they could or should leave, then he should have a cash cow for at least

1555
01:52:01,320 --> 01:52:05,960
a few years, and yet in less than a year and a half it was practically over. A year and a half

1556
01:52:05,960 --> 01:52:10,920
was impressive innings given how catastrophic it could have been, but Jake always wanted Team 10

1557
01:52:10,920 --> 01:52:15,880
to be more, as shown by his presentation of it in interviews and messaging. He wanted to make as

1558
01:52:15,880 --> 01:52:21,480
much money from the concept as possible, and by failing to ensure their longevity, he fell short

1559
01:52:21,480 --> 01:52:28,280
of that goal. So, why does someone as supposedly successful as Jake Paul fail so miserably?

1560
01:52:31,320 --> 01:52:41,160
Jake Paul appeared to have a plan for Team 10. That plan was to bring a load of smaller craters

1561
01:52:41,160 --> 01:52:45,880
into one space and use Team 10 as a way to gradually grow their channels, and in return he would have a

1562
01:52:45,880 --> 01:52:51,240
share of their success. Some people go and want to go off on their own, but it doesn't necessarily

1563
01:52:51,240 --> 01:52:56,280
mean they're not a part of the Team 10 family. We've still got percentages though, lonesome, and

1564
01:52:56,280 --> 01:53:00,120
precision. Although this wasn't spoken about too much, there were general allusions to contracts

1565
01:53:00,120 --> 01:53:03,880
that would provide Jake Paul with a cut of a person's revenue, even if they left the YouTube

1566
01:53:03,880 --> 01:53:08,200
collective. However, I don't think the intention of that contract was just to let Jake Paul have a

1567
01:53:08,200 --> 01:53:12,840
share of income after someone left. Jake had more than enough money. Moreover, it was to encourage

1568
01:53:12,840 --> 01:53:16,680
people to stay and make money with him, because deep down Jake Paul knew that a continuously

1569
01:53:16,680 --> 01:53:21,000
changing roster of creators would not be good for brand identity, and he had to create something

1570
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:25,880
that was successful enough to make a person stay, but not successful enough to make a person leave.

1571
01:53:25,880 --> 01:53:30,920
In essence, Team 10 was conceptualised as a honeypot for smaller creators. Jake Paul knew

1572
01:53:30,920 --> 01:53:35,800
that he had to make Team 10 an internet presence to guarantee his success, but he always seemed

1573
01:53:35,800 --> 01:53:39,640
cautious about how much power he was willing to grant them, from the simple decision of uploading

1574
01:53:39,640 --> 01:53:44,280
a significant portion of Team 10 content onto his own channel, calling the fans Jake Paulers,

1575
01:53:44,280 --> 01:53:48,040
to having an inner circle that oversaw a large majority of creative decisions. When people

1576
01:53:48,040 --> 01:53:52,280
raised certain concerns, he would supposedly reference PR, and how it would look if people left,

1577
01:53:52,280 --> 01:53:55,880
but it's also possible he didn't want people to live anywhere else than the house, because

1578
01:53:55,880 --> 01:54:00,280
that removal might give them some independence to make decisions about their future. He wanted fans

1579
01:54:00,280 --> 01:54:05,080
to be devoted to the holistic idea of Team 10 first, and any members other than himself second,

1580
01:54:05,080 --> 01:54:10,120
to maintain that threat of financial consequence if they did walk out, this idea that the fans

1581
01:54:10,120 --> 01:54:14,760
would not follow them out the door. The English Tudor story illustrated that although Jake may

1582
01:54:14,760 --> 01:54:19,400
have wanted to lift people up in a way, he wanted to keep them beneath him all the same, he wanted

1583
01:54:19,400 --> 01:54:23,160
to be their lifeline, if they walked away then they would be out of that spotlight he had provided

1584
01:54:23,160 --> 01:54:27,000
them with, and he was a well connected industry individual with roles on mainstream television.

1585
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:31,320
During the first months, this plan appeared to work, and even when it was tested by a situation

1586
01:54:31,320 --> 01:54:35,480
such as Alyssa Violet's departure, it didn't seem to dent the brand too much because a majority of

1587
01:54:35,480 --> 01:54:40,520
fans were more interested in what Jake and Team 10 had to say about it than the situation itself.

1588
01:54:40,520 --> 01:54:43,400
This all changed, however, when they released It's Everyday Bro.

1589
01:54:43,400 --> 01:54:57,240
It's Everyday Bro was a stroke of marketing genius that I have no doubt was as intentionally

1590
01:54:57,240 --> 01:55:01,560
eye catching as many people found it, but at the same time, it was too eye catching for what

1591
01:55:01,560 --> 01:55:06,200
Jake Paul had intended, because it gave the members of Team 10 a never before known presence within

1592
01:55:06,200 --> 01:55:10,920
the online world. There was no real way to predict this level of virality, sure, songs in the past

1593
01:55:10,920 --> 01:55:15,160
would become popular for being particularly bad, but really I think Jake was just more interested

1594
01:55:15,160 --> 01:55:19,800
in making a simple track with immature lyrics that his target demographic would consume.

1595
01:55:19,800 --> 01:55:24,440
Before Jake, Paul was just known as this businessman influencer at the helm of Team 10 who

1596
01:55:24,440 --> 01:55:29,080
would draw attention for his occasional wild antics. You ask the average netizen before the 31st of

1597
01:55:29,080 --> 01:55:33,480
May about any of the members in Team 10 and you would receive a blank stare, but after there was

1598
01:55:33,480 --> 01:55:37,560
this sense that these individuals had possessed their own status, and even if that status were

1599
01:55:37,560 --> 01:55:41,800
treated negatively, it was still a power of sorts that could be wielded in a way that Jake Paul

1600
01:55:41,800 --> 01:55:46,920
didn't like, it was associated with the brand. The winds of change were indicated by a list of

1601
01:55:46,920 --> 01:55:50,920
violence video, even though she had left months prior, she clearly sensed that public opinion was

1602
01:55:50,920 --> 01:55:55,080
turning against Team 10, and felt like she had a space to release an impactful video on her

1603
01:55:55,080 --> 01:55:59,240
experience with Jake Paul. This was obviously exacerbated by the supposition that Jake was

1604
01:55:59,240 --> 01:56:04,520
referring to her in It's Everyday Bro, but even if he wasn't, she clearly felt empowered in that moment.

1605
01:56:04,520 --> 01:56:09,960
Something clicks in your head, like you want to kill someone, but you want to cry, and you want to

1606
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:14,520
get revenge, but you can't. It's like so hard to explain.

1607
01:56:14,520 --> 01:56:19,080
Her video undermined this likely prevailing narrative from within Team 10, that if you walked away,

1608
01:56:19,080 --> 01:56:23,880
you'd lose everything that Jake had given you, that you'd be cut off from industry and a future within it.

1609
01:56:23,880 --> 01:56:28,600
As Team 10 became public enemy number one, Jake appeared to be losing his grasp on what he had

1610
01:56:28,600 --> 01:56:33,080
created. His behaviour became increasingly controversial and irrational, some might say they

1611
01:56:33,240 --> 01:56:36,680
were pushing the boundaries of content for entertainment and attention, but in doing this and

1612
01:56:36,680 --> 01:56:40,840
landing himself with a ton of negative publicity, he began to lose the credibility within the

1613
01:56:40,840 --> 01:56:45,000
industry that he held before, including his Disney show. It was hard to tell whether he thought that

1614
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:48,920
this behaviour would cement his status amongst the remaining members, but really, it just made him

1615
01:56:48,920 --> 01:56:53,080
less and less powerful, to the point that even his supposedly serious moments were challenged

1616
01:56:53,080 --> 01:56:57,640
fervently from all those outside his echo chamber. When he tried to play his hand against Alyssa,

1617
01:56:57,640 --> 01:57:01,800
attempting to punish her for leaving, he showed that he really possessed very little.

1618
01:57:01,800 --> 01:57:06,920
Alright guys, so I'm in a Skype call right now with someone who is a part of Team 10, as well as

1619
01:57:06,920 --> 01:57:12,360
was there, present, a witness to everything that happened on the night that I allegedly assaulted

1620
01:57:12,360 --> 01:57:16,920
Megan Zelli, who is the assistant of Jake Paul. The tide was turning, and Jake no longer had the

1621
01:57:16,920 --> 01:57:21,400
credentials to back up this idea that he could be a decisive figure in a person's career, and over

1622
01:57:21,400 --> 01:57:25,640
time, members began to peel off gradually, some more quietly than others. There was far less at

1623
01:57:25,640 --> 01:57:30,120
stake for one's reputation to disassociate from Jake Paul and Team 10, arguably it became the

1624
01:57:30,120 --> 01:57:34,600
smarter thing to do to move on from the team that had become so ubiquitously maligned.

1625
01:57:34,600 --> 01:57:38,840
When your reputation is in the gutter like that, your power is reduced, and whether or not Jake

1626
01:57:38,840 --> 01:57:42,840
realised that, he didn't appear to adjust his behaviour with mind to it. However, one of the

1627
01:57:42,840 --> 01:57:47,160
more pivotal moments that appeared to influence Jake's power over many of those around him was

1628
01:57:47,160 --> 01:57:51,560
one that is often overlooked, the moving of the Team 10 house. In this case, the accommodation

1629
01:57:51,560 --> 01:57:55,560
was clearly a means to control those within the four walls of the Team 10 residence, however,

1630
01:57:55,560 --> 01:57:59,800
when they moved house, four people did not move with them, and none of those four people

1631
01:57:59,800 --> 01:58:04,040
returned. Firstly, Martinez Twins, who formally left in November, followed by Tristan Tessa,

1632
01:58:04,040 --> 01:58:07,640
who left in the new year, Tessa moving in with Tristan, who had never resided with the rest of

1633
01:58:07,640 --> 01:58:12,200
the crew anyway. It once again seemed to prove that once members were out of that sphere of power,

1634
01:58:12,200 --> 01:58:16,440
they would feel more comfortable walking away. The only people who appeared to stay longer for

1635
01:58:16,440 --> 01:58:20,200
a year at this point were those in his inner circle, this made sense as these people appeared

1636
01:58:20,200 --> 01:58:24,520
to have some control over the direction of the team. Nevertheless, they were also prominent

1637
01:58:24,520 --> 01:58:29,480
members in the group's image, and therefore had to be treated with extreme care. Yet, in a final

1638
01:58:29,480 --> 01:58:34,520
massive faux pas, Jake involved his father, who was either ignorant or dismissive to the role that

1639
01:58:34,520 --> 01:58:39,160
these people played, and his supposedly aggressive auditing style pushed critical members out of the

1640
01:58:39,160 --> 01:58:43,880
circle who had shared that control with Jake, leaving him with full control but a depleted

1641
01:58:43,880 --> 01:58:49,720
group, and a fate practically sealed. In barely a year, Jake had lost complete control, from the

1642
01:58:49,720 --> 01:58:54,040
businessman whose members relied on him to develop their skills and influence, to the laughing stock

1643
01:58:54,040 --> 01:58:59,240
of a frat boy who called their father in when the pressure got too much, and paid the price for it.

1644
01:58:59,240 --> 01:59:04,280
Although it was true that Team 10 couldn't exist without Jake Paul, it couldn't exist with Jake Paul

1645
01:59:04,280 --> 01:59:07,160
either, and maybe it's fate was sealed from the start.

1646
01:59:14,600 --> 01:59:18,680
In the February 2018 video that Jake Paul published covering Team 10's demise,

1647
01:59:18,680 --> 01:59:23,400
he reflects on how he struggled to get a read on members, and to really trust their intent,

1648
01:59:23,400 --> 01:59:28,200
and that makes sense to me, but I don't think it came down to the issue that he was unable to trust

1649
01:59:28,200 --> 01:59:32,600
these people, I think it came down to the fact that he was unable to understand people's needs

1650
01:59:32,600 --> 01:59:36,600
and actually look out for them. I don't have a doubt that if Jake Paul believed that he had an

1651
01:59:36,600 --> 01:59:41,320
option to keep members at Team 10 that didn't involve the tactics he executed, then he may well

1652
01:59:41,320 --> 01:59:45,720
have just done that, but it could well be an issue of being raised in an environment where the only

1653
01:59:45,720 --> 01:59:51,080
way to get what you want was through emotionally manipulative stratagems. He would regularly try

1654
01:59:51,080 --> 01:59:55,720
to keep people under the Team 10 roof, would become hostile if his plans were challenged,

1655
01:59:55,720 --> 02:00:00,120
would attempt to punish those who left, even if he claimed to be all about peace and love,

1656
02:00:00,120 --> 02:00:05,320
he had to show what would happen if they left to make sure they remained, but he lost that power

1657
02:00:05,320 --> 02:00:10,200
to keep people in his life. Jake set up Team 10 with the goal of making as much money as possible

1658
02:00:10,200 --> 02:00:14,440
essentially, but sometimes you have to invest in people to keep them around rather than just try

1659
02:00:14,440 --> 02:00:18,760
to keep them under your thumb, but for a person who wanted to create an incubator for future talent,

1660
02:00:18,840 --> 02:00:22,440
Jake didn't trust those people enough to support them in ways that they needed,

1661
02:00:22,440 --> 02:00:27,000
he was more comfortable holding them hostage in Team 10 purgatory which made them feel the need

1662
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:31,880
to escape. To me, I think of the dichotomy between a rich servant and a poor master,

1663
02:00:31,880 --> 02:00:36,280
what Jake offered all of the members of Team 10 would inevitably make them a lot of money at some

1664
02:00:36,280 --> 02:00:40,920
point, even if they never derived any actual income from Jake Paul himself, but value isn't

1665
02:00:40,920 --> 02:00:45,240
singly derived from what's in your bank account, it's an intersection of a lot of aspects and

1666
02:00:45,240 --> 02:00:50,120
assets of one's life, and there's a point as well where someone will be happy with what they've made,

1667
02:00:50,120 --> 02:00:54,920
different people have different meanings of enough. For Jake Paul, I don't think anything

1668
02:00:54,920 --> 02:00:58,680
was ever enough for him, and so he struggled to empathise with people who actually did want

1669
02:00:58,680 --> 02:01:03,480
something simpler. Jake saw what he was giving as the ultimate sign of commitment and investment,

1670
02:01:03,480 --> 02:01:07,000
that he was growing these people's channels and providing them with a route to stardom,

1671
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:11,480
and in return they just had to relinquish some form of control over their lives, which he was

1672
02:01:11,480 --> 02:01:15,560
more than ready to make the most of. He always seemed to think that anything he gave to people

1673
02:01:15,560 --> 02:01:19,880
should be returned in a transactional sense with emotional loyalty, but the moment you do a favour

1674
02:01:19,880 --> 02:01:24,920
with the expectation of something in return, well it's no longer a favour. Those people didn't use

1675
02:01:24,920 --> 02:01:27,920
you, you tried to use them and failed.

1676
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:32,000
If Adam is a talent manager and he's going to be helping you get deals, he's going to be helping you

1677
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:40,000
protect your brand, I didn't even know he was your talent manager, I thought he was in team 10 with us,

1678
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:46,960
so that's another issue of this communication, that I thought he's a homie that's in team 10 with us,

1679
02:01:46,960 --> 02:01:50,000
that's dating Lauren, a part of team 10 as well.

1680
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:54,400
There's this episode of Team 10 Uncut where Jake Paul has this rather awkward exchange with a member

1681
02:01:54,400 --> 02:01:59,120
regarding a situation, and many observed in the comments how he seemed to be incapable of balancing

1682
02:01:59,120 --> 02:02:03,440
his personal capacities with his professional capacities. This was always one of the key problems,

1683
02:02:03,440 --> 02:02:07,280
because whenever he did something that may have negatively affected someone or upset them,

1684
02:02:07,280 --> 02:02:10,960
it was business to him, but whenever someone did something in return that bothered him,

1685
02:02:10,960 --> 02:02:15,120
it was personal. It was the case when people left and he said it was business, but clearly felt like

1686
02:02:15,120 --> 02:02:18,960
he was used because they didn't reciprocate his investment, and it was the case with a list of

1687
02:02:18,960 --> 02:02:22,640
sleeping with Logan after Jake had seemingly slept with multiple women during an emotionally

1688
02:02:22,640 --> 02:02:28,160
dysfunctional and abusive relationship. He was so robust, and yet so fragile, so methodic,

1689
02:02:28,160 --> 02:02:33,920
and yet so unnecessarily vindictive. It's strange to think how different this timeline may be if

1690
02:02:33,920 --> 02:02:38,560
Jake didn't think to scatter the verses of his breakout hit with excessive references to the

1691
02:02:38,560 --> 02:02:43,200
person he had evicted a few months before. Alyssa may never have made that video.

1692
02:02:43,200 --> 02:02:49,680
Alyssa- I decided to be savage like him, and it ended with me being homeless.

1693
02:02:49,680 --> 02:02:54,080
In the end, it just led to very unhealthy dynamics between himself and other members,

1694
02:02:54,080 --> 02:02:58,640
who had a lot less influence than him. It made the Team 10 house a very exhausting atmosphere

1695
02:02:58,640 --> 02:03:02,400
for some, and create a relationship with Jake Paul where people never really knew where they

1696
02:03:02,400 --> 02:03:07,120
stood. It wasn't just a case of Jake Paul being unable to trust other people, it was a case of

1697
02:03:07,120 --> 02:03:11,280
other people being unable to trust Jake Paul, and when you have a large group with a defined

1698
02:03:11,280 --> 02:03:15,280
ringleader, then you need to be able to put your faith in that person. To me, Jake Paul's claims

1699
02:03:15,280 --> 02:03:19,040
that everything was fake was a way to cope with the fact that he didn't know where to set the

1700
02:03:19,040 --> 02:03:22,880
boundaries of reality in his interpersonal relationships with his colleagues and friends.

1701
02:03:22,880 --> 02:03:27,280
His commitment to maximising Team 10's profits while trying to use his personal self created

1702
02:03:27,280 --> 02:03:31,680
a conflict where his supposed friends didn't know who he was. This was demonstrated when he tried

1703
02:03:31,680 --> 02:03:36,640
to revive Team 10 with a show that operates in a genre where a lot of content is often fabricated,

1704
02:03:36,640 --> 02:03:41,200
seemingly under the expectation that that's what people wanted to see. They wanted the drama, sure,

1705
02:03:41,200 --> 02:03:45,120
they wanted the fight, sure, Jake wanted to give them that, but without any of the actual stakes

1706
02:03:45,120 --> 02:03:49,680
outside of the channel. Unfortunately for Jake, that aspect of realism was what made the original

1707
02:03:49,680 --> 02:03:54,080
Team 10 so interesting and fascinating for viewers. What makes YouTube successful in that way

1708
02:03:54,080 --> 02:03:58,560
is that people do feel involved and closer to these creators, the drama, responses, uploads,

1709
02:03:58,560 --> 02:04:02,640
commentary. It made people feel close to the action and gave them this affinity to those

1710
02:04:02,640 --> 02:04:06,720
involved, whether they were on Jake's side or not. It is ironic that even after being shunned by much

1711
02:04:06,720 --> 02:04:11,120
of the mainstream industry, Jake still wanted to give people a Disney Channel version of Team 10

1712
02:04:11,120 --> 02:04:15,760
drama. Jake's desire for complete control of a narrative ultimately compromised the reason why

1713
02:04:15,760 --> 02:04:20,400
Team 10 was so successful in the first place though, this was only Team 10 by name, very few

1714
02:04:20,400 --> 02:04:25,040
people will ever think of that name and think of these people. No offence to them, but maybe it's

1715
02:04:25,040 --> 02:04:29,440
not a name you want to be associated with anyway. Jake Paul will always be the first name that comes

1716
02:04:29,440 --> 02:04:34,720
to people's minds, and that's what Jake Paul wanted. He was the founder, he was the innovator,

1717
02:04:34,720 --> 02:04:40,160
he was the communicator, and so much more, but he was never everything. Even if Jake Paul was

1718
02:04:40,160 --> 02:04:45,280
the centrepiece of Team 10, even if he was the secret sauce, as he called it. The reason that a

1719
02:04:45,280 --> 02:04:49,680
secret sauce can remain secret is the presence of other ingredients, and when something comes

1720
02:04:49,680 --> 02:04:53,840
together, and when something works, you make sure you keep those ingredients there. Most people

1721
02:04:53,840 --> 02:04:58,240
don't leave squads because they don't like drama, they're musicians that remained together for decades

1722
02:04:58,240 --> 02:05:02,720
despite hating each other. If there was something worth staying for, then many of those who left

1723
02:05:02,720 --> 02:05:07,440
would, but Jake's ego was too big to give people a reason to stay, continuously claiming that it was

1724
02:05:07,440 --> 02:05:12,720
all under control while watching the ship sink, involving people incapable of resolving the glaring

1725
02:05:12,720 --> 02:05:17,040
flaws and maintaining a personal environment where others wanted to be, discarding the mantra

1726
02:05:17,040 --> 02:05:23,760
that he started the team under, for the talent, by the talent. What sort of talent is your father?

1727
02:05:23,760 --> 02:05:39,040
Crowd Cheers

1728
02:05:39,040 --> 02:05:43,920
The success of Team 10 was a recipe that captured the imagination of youngsters all over the world,

1729
02:05:43,920 --> 02:05:48,640
alongside the ire of many creators and commentators who wondered what their appeal even was.

1730
02:05:48,640 --> 02:05:53,200
Well, it appealed to the most primitive idea of success, the freedom to just live as recklessly

1731
02:05:53,200 --> 02:05:57,440
as you wish every day and hit a reset button before the next one starts. Do whatever the hell

1732
02:05:57,440 --> 02:06:01,760
you want, however you want. With the power of producing and editing, they successfully crafted

1733
02:06:01,760 --> 02:06:06,400
that image for millions of people. However, there are a fair few reasons why we don't live like that

1734
02:06:06,400 --> 02:06:11,280
most of the time, and as Team 10 became more notorious and unstable, those reasons became clear.

1735
02:06:11,280 --> 02:06:15,440
You can't hit a reset button at the end of the day, the reckless behaviour will stick with people

1736
02:06:15,440 --> 02:06:19,680
to the point where they won't want to be a part of that life anymore. It's not something they'll

1737
02:06:19,680 --> 02:06:24,320
want to do, they came to that house with massive dreams, but all they received was an early wakeup

1738
02:06:24,320 --> 02:06:29,360
call. Most people can't and won't live like that, and I don't think Jake ever properly comprehended

1739
02:06:29,360 --> 02:06:33,520
that. Maybe he just didn't want to, and would have rather continued to live in his fantasy of

1740
02:06:33,520 --> 02:06:37,840
excess, but his failure to address the fact that sometimes people just want a bit of their life to

1741
02:06:37,840 --> 02:06:42,320
themselves was what cost him their company, it served as a reminder that there are some things

1742
02:06:42,320 --> 02:06:48,160
you can never fully control. For all the highs and lows, Team 10 lived like it died, at the hands of

1743
02:06:48,160 --> 02:06:53,600
a man who's ego was too great for one, but not enough for ten. Whether it could have amounted to

1744
02:06:53,600 --> 02:06:58,400
something greater is a question that will never likely be answered, but perhaps that's for the best.

1745
02:06:59,200 --> 02:07:04,960
It's over now, and to be honest I can't ever see it coming back, but for a few months in 2017,

1746
02:07:05,760 --> 02:07:10,960
for better and for worse, it really was every day. Bro.

1747
02:07:18,960 --> 02:07:37,680
So yeah, that was the video, I hope you enjoyed it, it was certainly an experience for me. I'd like to

1748
02:07:37,680 --> 02:07:43,280
give a big thanks to the editors as always, they've done a great job, and I appreciate all their work,

1749
02:07:43,280 --> 02:07:47,520
and there are some really really good edits in this one, so I hope you appreciated that too. I'd

1750
02:07:47,520 --> 02:07:53,360
like to give a big thanks to the post editor, Kojak, person on audio, who I assume will be

1751
02:07:53,360 --> 02:07:59,760
Linuski, but we can change this bit if it's not. Thumbnail artist, Staffo, fantastic work as always,

1752
02:07:59,760 --> 02:08:04,720
big shout out to my patrons, $10 plus patrons on the screen now, but also have to give a special

1753
02:08:04,720 --> 02:08:10,720
shout out to the $50 patrons, Seri Tisch, Esther Bedoya, and Hypercube, thank you as always for

1754
02:08:10,720 --> 02:08:15,680
your support, I really appreciate it. Big shout out to the artists, all their credits will be in

1755
02:08:15,680 --> 02:08:21,120
the pinned comment alongside editors and so on. If your art appears in this video and you want

1756
02:08:21,120 --> 02:08:26,160
the credit for it, then just let me know. Also a big shout out to the sponsor Surfshark, it's been

1757
02:08:26,160 --> 02:08:30,960
a pleasure working with you as always, and I look forward to doing it again very soon. And just a

1758
02:08:30,960 --> 02:08:36,560
reminder that it is code opinion you need, code opinion for 3 months free. I don't really know

1759
02:08:36,560 --> 02:08:41,680
