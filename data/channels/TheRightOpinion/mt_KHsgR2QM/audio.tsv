0	26160	If we don't do this, we're done for.
26160	27160	I can't get in.
27160	28760	Okay, we have to try something different.
28760	29760	I just sent you a link.
29760	30760	Have you got it?
30760	31760	I got it.
31760	32760	There's only 90 seconds left.
32760	33760	We are running out of time.
33760	34760	Okay, open it.
34760	39760	Set location to Ashburn and click continue.
39760	40760	Done.
40760	44080	Quickly reload the page and we should be in.
44080	45080	They know.
45080	46080	What?
46080	47080	They know we're on a proxy.
47080	48080	Try another server.
48080	49080	There isn't one.
49080	50080	Are you sure?
50080	51080	There's nothing.
51080	52080	60 seconds left.
52080	53080	60 seconds, Gabe.
53080	57080	All right, we're going to need to try something else here.
58000	59000	Have you tried Surfshark?
59000	60000	Surfshark?
60000	61000	Surfshark?
61000	62000	Yes.
62000	65120	You've got the link now.
65120	66120	It's downloading.
66120	67120	What is it?
67120	68120	It's a VPN service.
68120	71080	When things are geo-blocked right now, we can circumvent it.
71080	74160	We can virtually appear like we are in any one of a hundred countries.
74160	77640	If a Netflix show isn't available in your region, just change your location.
77640	79100	And it encrypts your traffic.
79100	82360	Your internet service provider can't see what you've been up to online.
82360	84960	And Surfshark doesn't keep logs of what you're doing either.
84960	86960	I've got it.
87840	88840	Open it.
88840	89840	Type Boston.
89840	90840	Hit connect.
90840	91840	That's all I have to do?
91840	92840	Just hit connect?
92840	93840	It's that simple?
93840	95480	It really is that simple.
95480	96480	This doesn't work.
96480	102800	We are out of time.
102800	105440	It's still blocked.
105440	107760	They have over 3200 different servers.
107760	109760	Connect to a different one.
117760	121760	Did we get it?
125760	127760	We got it.

146960	157760	2017.
157760	161760	So that first story we're going to talk about today is about a family that has garnered
161760	163760	a lot of negative attention in the past week.
163760	165760	2017 was an interesting year on YouTube.
165760	171760	You poured molten lava on a phone and a cockroach.
171760	175760	A year of evolution, restlessness, and scandal.
176560	183760	Hello, I wanted to make a statement on what I said in my previous livestream.
183760	187360	The platform reached new heights, but there were many lows.
187360	191760	The website's ecosystem was irreparably changed, and creators were forced to adapt to it.
191760	196560	A bunch of advertisers, fearing backlash, removed their ads entirely from YouTube, and
196560	199760	during this period, every YouTuber saw a decrease in revenue.
199760	203760	Yet, amongst this all, the year mostly belonged to a creator by the name of Jake Paul, and
203760	207760	his motley crew of vagabonds known as Team 10, who had burst onto the scene with all
207760	211760	the bombast of the showbiz world's most notorious figures.
215760	219760	The colossal rise of Team 10 was attributed to a combination of pranks, music videos,
219760	223760	and controversies that all drew attention, criticism, and even anger from fellow content
223760	227760	creators and the general public alike, barely taking them a month to go from just another
227760	231760	YouTube ensemble to public enemy number one.
231760	235760	They continued to participate in escalating antics that would redefine content on YouTube
235760	239760	as many perceived at the time, cementing their status as YouTube royalty, for better and
239760	241760	for worse.
245760	249760	Fast forward a few years, and their YouTube channel is gone, many of their videos are
249760	253760	gone, and their presence online is left behind little more than a brief summary on their
253760	257760	website, and the commitment that a new era is coming soon.
257760	261760	They're carved out on the platform, lost.
261760	265760	Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of
265760	269760	a twat with too much free time, and Team 10, what happened
269760	273760	to them? Let's find out.
287760	291760	As I'm sure you're aware, we all know who Team 10
291760	295760	started with. However,
295760	299760	the origin story is somewhat more intriguing than one might assume it was, because before
299760	303760	Team 10 burst onto the scene, Jake Paul was a relatively popular teen actor and influencer,
303760	307760	posting with his brother Logan, don't know if you've heard of him, on Vine. They garnered
307760	311760	a multi-million following from posting short clips that capitalised on pantomime humour
311760	315760	in the mid-2010s. The content obviously hasn't dated particularly well,
318760	322760	but for what it's worth,
322760	326760	Logan and Jake were strong physical actors who could manipulate their bodies pretty successfully
326760	330760	to enable effective slapstick comedy. Now, Vine didn't last too long,
330760	334760	but the dreams that Jake Paul possessed persisted, and not too long after, he moved to LA
334760	338760	in pursuit of a greater goal, celebrity stardom. This appeared to be materialising
338760	342760	as soon as he acquired a role on the Disney Channel show Bizaardvark, alongside
342760	346760	Madison Hu and Olivia Rodrigo. Jake Paul played the role of a character who would partake
346760	350760	in a variety of days for social media clout, which was touted by Disney as an appropriate role
350760	354760	for such a creator. The show revolved around the concept of reality online, which was fitting
354760	358760	given that at the time Jake Paul was working on his own YouTube projects.
358760	362760	This included a channel called Jake Paul Productions, which appeared to alternate between
362760	366760	the genres of vlogging, comedy, and music. It had been running since May 2014,
366760	371760	and it accumulated a few hundred thousand subscribers by the time Jake's big Disney break came around.
371760	375760	However, not satisfied with a career in acting and a relatively fruitful YouTube channel,
375760	379760	something was brewing behind the scenes, a little project that Jake had been working on
379760	384760	with a few of his buddies, a syndicate known as Team 10. Team 10 had clearly been an idea
384760	388760	conceived by Paul as he was moving to Los Angeles. The Twitter appeared in September 2015
388760	392760	and the official website not too long after. In its formative era, there wasn't too much known
392760	396760	about its ethos or its aims, as its members were still not a major presence online.
396760	400760	However, this would gradually change over the following year as they worked to expand their influence.
400760	405760	Team 10's YouTube channel was launched around May 2016, a couple days before his two-year
405760	409760	upload anniversary on the video sharing platform. Although they were establishing a YouTube
409760	413760	presence, their marketing clearly presented something else, that this was an agency looking to
413760	417760	maximise the potential of future influencers. The advertising heralded it as the first ever
417760	422760	social media for the talent, by the talent. And although channel syndicates and collaborative
422760	426760	groups had existed long before Team 10, there was an air of formality about this arrangement
426760	430760	that appeared to set these creators apart. Being part of Team 10 granted you immediate benefits.
430760	434760	First of all, you'd have a slot on the Team 10 social medias, you'd be listed on their running
434760	438760	Twitter feed, you'd have access to uploading on their YouTube channel, and you'd likely be in the
438760	442760	proximity of the then up-and-coming Jake Paul, who was quickly becoming an overnight sensation,
442760	446760	and would regularly invite other members of the team onto his main channel. Most impressively
446760	451760	though, you'd have a spot in the Team 10 house, a sizable mansion which boasted a basketball hoop
451760	455760	in the kitchen and its own DJ booth. It seems that at its inception, Team 10 was going for a slightly
455760	460760	more diverse assemblage of talent. The early roster featured a young AJ Mitchell who would go on
460760	464760	to find considerable success as a solo musician, Alex Lang who would go on to find work as an actor,
464760	469760	and Nils Visser who was an aspiring DJ at the time. However, in spite of the marketing of Team 10
469760	473760	as a network to bolster individual success, there was a much greater motive that would become very
473760	477760	apparent if you read any of their blog posts from this time. We'll focus on this little excerpt,
477760	482760	that describes their new crib. After listing out all the cool aspects of the Team 10 house,
482760	485760	they share one additional detail, that quote,
504760	508760	Of course, this isn't a great revelation, nor is it some grand deception, but it is a tactic that reveals
508760	513760	what Jake's true intent with Team 10 was, and how it was capable of doing something that he alone
513760	518760	could not, and that was to capitalise on the fandom. You can have a teen idol who will be loved by
518760	522760	swathes of adoring fans, but put them in a group, and you have a dynamic that allows audiences to pick
522760	526760	favourites, play characters off each other, and be invested in the interweaving storylines that existed
526760	531760	in their lives. By then it was pretty clear that Jake Paul knew his appeal to younger teen audiences,
531760	535760	and if you didn't think he was explicit enough with his intentions, then you didn't have to look beyond
535760	540760	the interviews he gave for a more direct explanation of where his goals lay. As you get more and more popular
540760	545760	and start to build a brand name for yourself in the space, you start working with big Fortune 500 companies,
545760	549760	merchandising deals, you can tour, there are lots of ways to monetise, but if you have millions of fans,
549760	554760	and you can convert even 5% of them to pay for something of yours, you are in the 7 figure range.
554760	559760	Jake Paul was doing what a lot of corporate and record label executives had done before, he was manufacturing
559760	563760	Teen Appeal, but whereas many of those who had come before worked within the bounds that corporations
563760	568760	granted them, Jake seemed much more involved in the brand image than the teen idols who had come before him,
568760	573760	and possessed no shame in doing so. Jake Paul crafted a very polarised marketing strategy, on one hand
573760	578760	he placed himself as the nexus of youth stardom, priming a parasocial relationship with audiences who
578760	583760	wanted to feel like they were a part of his life, but conversely also playing to the crowd of entrepreneurs
583760	588760	who wanted a taste of that lifestyle. In another interview with Entertainment Tonight, Paul branded himself
589760	594760	in that he wanted to not just be a creator himself, but he wanted to raise the next generation of influencers,
594760	600760	and that's what Team 10 represented to him, sowing the seeds of talent and reaping the rewards when they came to fruition.
600760	604760	However, although he had amassed a decent number of subscribers on their YouTube channels, and was building
604760	610760	a substantial relationship with audiences, it was hard to say that Jake Paul or Team 10 had quite made the big leagues yet,
610760	614760	there was still a formula waiting to be perfected, but if they wanted to do that, they would have to continue
614760	619760	pushing the boundaries of their content into new realms. How would they manage?
624760	625760	Well.
629760	635760	Although 2016 marked the online establishment of Team 10, 2017 was definitely the year it began to take off,
635760	639760	particularly on Jake Paul's main channel which featured many of the members and the shenanigans that occurred
639760	641760	in the four walls of the Squads Humbler boat.
647760	652760	Paul obviously had a penchant for doing it large, the sort of formula that Mr Beast refined in recent years,
652760	657760	of investing a lot to make a lot. This often led to rather high-budget stunts, pranks, and trips that would regularly
657760	662760	capture the imagination of prospective audiences. His actions were presented in the light of a brash frat boy
662760	667760	who was living it up, pushing the envelope to the extreme. However, unlike the platform's now largest individual creator,
667760	672760	the younger Paul brother also integrated elements of Team 10's personal lives into the content, and this formed
672760	677760	a more sequential narrative within the uploads. Even though these videos would work as standalone clip baiting content,
677760	682760	you could easily be drawn into the interpersonal relationships that these creators would have between each other,
682760	687760	and Jake would regularly alternate between silly and serious, even if it was just through whether he used up or lower case
687760	692760	in the titles, or punctuation marks like ellipses. There was an emotion that would be elicited from a user,
692760	697760	like excitement or fear. There was drama, drama that we'll talk about in a bit, but even when it seemed negative,
697760	702760	it served some sort of purpose in appearing real to those who watched it. Jake Paul knew exactly how he wanted
702760	707760	a video to be marketed, and the daily vlogging style allowed for a constant schedule that made the most of an algorithm
707760	712760	that often rewarded a strong upload schedule. This position Jake Paul's channel in particular is one of the fastest growing channels
712760	717760	on the platform, however many of his Team 10 colleagues also experienced unprecedented prosperity, especially Erica
717760	722760	Costell, the then girlfriend of Paul, whose romantic involvement with Jake was one of the centrepieces of the channel,
722760	727760	and would regularly be used as a selling point for a variety of commodities. All of these demonstrated the components
727760	732760	of the very successful channel that Jake had spoken about in interviews, one that progressed with its viewership's investment
732760	737760	in it. They had a loyal following from their fandom, but it also felt they had yet to become the colossus that Jake likely
737760	742760	envisioned during the conception of the channel. Not that many people were speaking about their content outside their audience,
742760	747760	and there was probably a question about where they would hit that ceiling, but that was about to change.
747760	753760	2017 was not just an interesting year in general, but an interesting year for music.
759760	764760	Particularly on YouTube, we're just seeing a rise in popularity for creator-performed diss tracks, most famously
764760	769760	by the likes of creators like RiceGum. The popularity of general rap music on YouTube had been bolstered by the fact
769760	774760	that reaction content in the musical domain was often oriented towards hip-hop, which seemed to inspire creators
774760	779760	to chance their own arm. These diss tracks were not particularly exceptional, but they were a goofy source of entertainment,
779760	785760	and a new spin on the then pretty exhaustive reaction commentary genre as a whole. However, no creator had properly made
785760	790760	an actual diss track to the rest of YouTube, and why would they? It would be an incredibly braggadocious thing for any creator
790760	796760	to do, and you could easily end up alienating your audience by insulting them. After all, they are part of the YouTube
796760	804760	network as much as anyone. You'd have to have confidence-bordering arrogance to do it, and well, one man, or one team, did.
807760	812760	Now, brag rappers long existed in the music industry, as a matter of fact, its existence underpins many modern
812760	818760	cornerstones of hip-hop music. However, brag rap worked because the brags were either impressive, challenging, or amusing,
818760	823760	and the artists actually had the charisma to back up what they were saying. Jake Paul, on the other hand, does not.
823760	828760	He had attempted a diss track against Ricegum in 2016, which was no better, but you'd think he would have learned something
828760	831760	in the year since, but alas.
835760	840760	There is this degree of ineptitude that is almost fascinating when watching the music video. It exhibits a near elementary
840760	845760	understanding of how rhyming and wordplay operates within music, the number of couplets that just fall flat on their face,
845760	851760	the similes that are so basic they feel like they were written by someone with the talent of a grapefruit. They have a team of people,
851760	858760	this is the best they could come up with. There were so many inconceivable moments, Jake Paul's merch selling like a God Church,
858760	864760	Nick Crompton hailing from the city of England, and using the word litting, unironically. It was pure, unadulterated trash,
864760	866760	and everyone knew.
871760	876760	The thing about virally bad music is that it often has the potential to be more successful than virally good music.
876760	882760	This started all the way back in 2010 with Justin Bieber's Baby, which for a long time was the most disliked video on YouTube,
882760	887760	and persisted over the years with songs like Friday. Whereas in the case of Rebecca Black and Justin Bieber, there was a sense
887760	892760	that they were trying to perform a musical number, Jake Paul and his colleagues possessed none of that, especially given the subject
892760	898760	of their rap song was how much better they were than all of you. Accordingly, they were afforded even less charity by the
898760	904760	already savage internet dwellers who wasted no time in going at Team 10's attempts to establish themselves online.
904760	910760	I heard it in one day, they came out with that. I'm not saying it's easy to write music at all, I know it's tough,
910760	913760	but I think I could come up with a better song in one day.
913760	918760	The criticism came thick and fast, with many people pointing out the obvious, that Jake Paul was a subpar rapper,
918760	924760	and with such a popular and easy target, it wasn't long before even the platform's largest creators were chiming in on the platform's
924760	925760	personality.
925760	930760	I think this song has killed me. I wanna die more than I've ever died before.
930760	937760	Jake Paul was right in one sense, the PewDiePie was indeed next, and in doing that, Team 10 did what they were probably
937760	940760	setting out to do, establishing themselves.
953760	958760	Now, why did I include this part when I'm talking about the demise? Well, I think it very aptly describes Jake Paul's
958760	963760	relationship with Team 10. Jake Paul, on one hand, seemed like a very financially astute individual.
963760	970760	Um, yeah, so we're in a company called Teamdom, you can think of it as a modern day media conglomerate,
970760	980760	where we use social media and content marketing to drive products, talent, make viral videos, and we work with brands,
980760	983760	and develop products, and that sort of stuff, yeah.
983760	985760	On the other hand, he wrote this.
986760	991760	Now, there isn't a direct overlap between business acumen and songwriting capability, but it wouldn't have been
991760	995760	hard for him to hire a ghostwriter who probably would have assisted him with some pretty fire bars.
995760	1000760	There was very little stopping Jake from writing a perfectly serviceable song, but he ultimately chose not to,
1000760	1005760	and he was also heavily involved in writing other people's verses as well, which seems strange given that they all
1005760	1009760	have talent in the musical vicinity, at least on par with their wringling.
1009760	1013760	The truth was that Jake assumed he knew better than everyone else, and maybe he did.
1013760	1017760	Jake Paul knew that the most easily exploited market was a younger child with an internet connection,
1017760	1021760	and an interest in modern culture and glamorous lifestyles, people who want to live like them,
1021760	1026760	so why wouldn't he produce content that is intentionally juvenile in its presentation, yet confident in its messaging?
1026760	1030760	It's the easiest way to tell a young person that, this is how you live like me.
1030760	1034760	If anything, It's Everyday Bro was a statement of transparency to everyone else online,
1034760	1038760	they were going to make a shit ton of money off their viewers, and there was nothing you could do about it.
1038760	1045760	Barely days after people started responding to his video, he dropped God Church merch that probably did sell like a God Church.
1045760	1049760	Despite his atrociousness, It's Everyday Bro quickly accumulated over 100 million views on YouTube,
1049760	1054760	charted in multiple countries, and ascended to number 3 in the weekly American iTunes chart.
1054760	1059760	Everyone was talking about Team 10, and nearly every member experienced exponential growth during this period,
1059760	1062760	many of whom appearing on the list of YouTube's fastest growing channels.
1062760	1067760	Commentators could say whatever they wanted, but it did not change the reality that Team 10 had arrived.
1067760	1071760	The question is though, what do you do now all eyes are on you?
1071760	1075760	My older brother, Logan Paul, probably never heard of him. He basically, um...
1075760	1078760	dissed, if you could even call us that, in his YouTube video.
1078760	1081760	He dissed, he dissed, It's Everyday Bro, the song, badly.
1081760	1083760	Let's talk about the concept of beef.
1083760	1087760	By now it was pretty clear that Team 10 were not in many people's good books,
1087760	1091760	but it wasn't necessarily bad for business, particularly given there was potential for conflict between groups.
1091760	1094760	Now, most of these people are not the most relevant to today's discourse,
1094760	1098760	and to be frank, a lot of the drama after the song's popularity was pretty manufactured,
1098760	1101760	including Jake's short-lived beef with his brother and the pop group Why Don't We,
1101760	1104760	but there was something brewing beneath the surface.
1104760	1109760	At the end of Logan's rather short response, you see, there is the apparent reveal of someone who is known to Jake.
1109760	1111760	Who is that person?
1125760	1128760	Anyway, there was this tribal element about It's Everyday Bro,
1128760	1131760	and it's relationship to Team 10, a sort of chest-beating moment.
1131760	1136760	And I say it's a diss to the whole of YouTube, and it is, but it was also a diss to a variety of people.
1136760	1141760	Nevertheless, there is what many assume to be a very real reference to a person by the name of Alyssa Violet,
1141760	1143760	and the relationship that she had with Team 10.
1143760	1147760	Let's go back to 2016 briefly, when Team 10 was still in its infancy.
1147760	1152760	As noted, there were a fair few members who were in and out of the house before a solid roster was assembled,
1152760	1155760	but none that were likely closer to Jake than Alyssa herself.
1155760	1164760	Alyssa and Jake went back, and I mean back in this sense, actually back to Jake Paul's home state of Ohio.
1164760	1168760	They met at 18, both fresh out of high school, when Jake moved to LA, as did Alyssa,
1168760	1170760	signing a five-year contract with Team 10.
1170760	1173760	And at first, real rumours swirled about her and Jake's romantic potential,
1173760	1179760	with many speculating on their relationship status, and Team 10 even marketing merchandise related to the couple's connection.
1179760	1184760	However, at the start of 2017, this soured when Alyssa was abruptly removed from the Team 10 group,
1184760	1187760	with Jake releasing a distraught statement alleging that she cheated on him.
1187760	1193760	Alyssa adamantly denied this, and put out her own statement saying that she couldn't have cheated because they were never a legitimate couple,
1193760	1196760	expressing a sentiment of betrayal that he couldn't even make such claims.
1196760	1202760	One thing was for certain though, it concluded the will they, won't they saga, with a rather definite they won't.
1202760	1207760	This tension persisted over the following months, with Hollywood Gossip Magazines continuing to cover the story.
1207760	1213760	However, It's Everyday Bro, and the lyrics relating to what was sent at 4.52, once more placed this breakup underneath the spotlight
1213760	1216760	as they appeared to be an indirect reference to their breakup.
1216760	1221760	At this point, Team 10 were rather widely hated by the online world for their godawful music,
1221760	1225760	but Alyssa was about to give them one more reason, or a few more at least.
1225760	1230760	Alyssa- I just don't understand how someone could do that to someone. I really don't.
1230760	1235760	On the 9th of June, Alyssa Viola uploaded a video entitled, What You've Been Waiting For.
1235760	1240760	This video is a much more personal dissertation on her relationship with Jake, expressing that she legitimately loved him,
1240760	1245760	and that she experienced serious emotional turmoil due to the fact that he regularly played with her expectations,
1245760	1248760	including asking her to leave the bedroom so he could sleep with other girls.
1248760	1254760	Alyssa- I'd move in with him, sleeping in the same bed, basically together at this point, but without a title.
1254760	1258760	But then he would always have girls over in front of me, and I was just like, what the frick?
1258760	1262760	So then we're not together. But then he would play all these mind games with me and just be like, yo, don't get mad,
1262760	1269760	having a girl over. Can you do that 25,000 times? I would be in our room editing or doing something,
1269760	1275760	and then all of a sudden he'd walk in and be like, yo, can you leave, please, for two hours? Can you go upstairs?
1275760	1279760	Can you leave for a little bit? And I was like, why? He was like, oh, I'm having a girl over.
1279760	1283760	We're gonna hang out in here. Okay. It was heartbroken. Legit heartbroken.
1283760	1287760	This was a significant detail in the video, given that some of Team 10's most successful uploads at that point
1287760	1291760	were content that clickbaited the speculative aspect of Jake and Alyssa's relationship.
1291760	1296760	In essence, she felt used for content, and then cast aside when she wouldn't play Jake Paul's game.
1296760	1302760	I finally treated him the way that he was treating me, and he didn't like it. He got pissed and kicked me out.
1302760	1309760	Like, the one time I decided to be savage like him, and it ended with me being homeless.
1309760	1314760	Although a footnote in a lengthy rebuke to Jake Paul, it seemed to illuminate the idea that Team 10 was living
1314760	1318760	a much more manufactured lifestyle, the one that was portrayed over YouTube.
1318760	1323760	The video as a whole reflected the sort of control that Jake also exerted over people who were bound to him,
1323760	1327760	metaphorically and contractually, but it wasn't over yet.
1337760	1341760	At the end of the day, you can't just say I'm sorry and take everything back.
1341760	1345760	I'm hurt still, and you've hurt a lot of people. The damage is already done.
1345760	1349760	You can't just kill someone and bring them back to life. It doesn't work like that in the real world.
1349760	1355760	And I know a lot of you will be like, Alyssa, don't release that track like you're such a b****. Be the bigger person.
1355760	1360760	No, I'm sorry, guys. I've been wanting to make this video for so long now. I'm very honest.
1360760	1363760	If I got a boob job, I would tell you guys I got a boob job.
1363760	1369760	Rice and I have been working on the song, and we put our blood, sweat, and tears into this, and I'm proud of it. I want to put it out there.
1369760	1374760	Alyssa Violet's video is a bit strange in the sense that the first 14 minutes contain a lot of seemingly sincere criticism
1374760	1378760	of Jake Paul and the Team 10 dynamic. However, she concludes the video with the promise of a diss rap of her own,
1378760	1382760	a collaboration with then extremely popular creator and YouTube rapper RiceGum.
1382760	1387760	She announced a final verse and music video would be dropping in a few days, but releases a majority of the lyrical content
1387760	1392760	for the viewers to enjoy. This seemed like a strange contrast to the rest of the video, and felt more like an indulgence
1392760	1395760	to the performative content that Team 10 had been participating in.
1395760	1400760	Barely a day after, Jake Paul had released a response to Alyssa Violet's video where he had mostly been
1400760	1404760	invasive of divulging any intimate information, dancing around subjects as a whole.
1404760	1409760	He also recorded this alongside a monologue where he talks about decreasing online hate and being kinder to each other,
1409760	1414760	a complete coincidence I'm sure. However, he said regardless of what came next, he would not be responding
1414760	1419760	as he didn't want to deal with the drama publicly, likely aware that any engagement could bring the rest of his crew
1419760	1423760	into the drama, and the possible questions it could attract about the nature of Team 10 itself.
1423760	1428760	On the 11th of June, the song and music video for RiceGum and Alyssa Violet's diss track, It's Every Night Sis,
1428760	1433760	dropped on Rice's YouTube channel, and, well, the least I can say is that it was better than it's everyday bro.
1439760	1445760	The flow in the bars were a stark improvement on Team 10's offering, although by lyrical standards it still left a lot to be desired,
1445760	1450760	with a lot of thematic repetition and couplets that didn't quite rhyme as well as they probably could.
1450760	1455760	However, it was definitely designed to be a more personal attack as they harp on Jake Paul's high school history,
1455760	1459760	which had been portrayed by some ex-students as being mired by ruffian and bully boy behaviour.
1464760	1469760	Following this, a lot of people took the side of Alyssa, with many criticising Jake harshly in his comments section.
1469760	1474760	However, the aspect of this once more being projected onto a YouTube diss rap tended to reinforce the facade
1474760	1479760	of Team 10 rather than actually undermining it. Jake Paul operated over the medium of performance,
1479760	1484760	and ultimately regardless of what you said over a music video, it was only going to more deeply invest people
1484760	1490760	than actually rip the mask off, which is what Alyssa appeared to be trying to do throughout the majority of her initial upload.
1490760	1495760	I don't know how I could love a person that treats someone like that. I don't know if I was in love with him,
1495760	1504760	or the idea of him, or who I thought he was. I think I was just addicted to the pain of wanting someone so unattainable.
1504760	1509760	Ultimately, in spite of the massive view count this drama generated, and testimony from a believable source,
1509760	1514760	Team 10 remained largely unscathed, and continued to pump out content on a daily basis.
1514760	1518760	Although Alyssa's video walked the line of tearing down the pretense of Team 10's content,
1518760	1524760	it only stopped short of doing so, and instead of looking at this video of how Jake had used a person to create a reality
1524760	1529760	for their channel, they tended to look at it from the context of how Jake had treated a former member of Team 10.
1529760	1533760	What their image was at that time didn't matter, as long as they had the tools to pull it off,
1533760	1538760	and in the coming month it became clear that there was to be an embrace of the villainous status that had been bestowed
1538760	1543760	onto them by their critics. This meant more emotional, serious videos, more content addressing their own friendships
1543760	1548760	and relationships, and more pranks and stunts that promised even higher stakes than the last.
1548760	1553760	Eventually, the scope of what Team 10 were aspiring for in their little fantasy world began to have implications
1553760	1554760	for the rest of planet Earth.
1554760	1555760	I'm cramping!
1555760	1556760	Yo, I don't know who won.
1556760	1557760	I need help, Chance!
1557760	1558760	You gotta hand me!
1558760	1560760	I don't know, bro, we need to fix it!
1560760	1561760	We need to replay!
1561760	1562760	Cut it! Call for it! Call for it!
1562760	1563760	Replay!
1563760	1569760	As you're likely aware, Team 10 had a house. Unlike many houses, it was in a neighbourhood, which unsurprisingly,
1570760	1576760	was not full of young people looking to party, and as Team 10's antics gradually escalated, so did the negative aspect
1576760	1581760	of those in the real world. In the month following, their house hosted a multitude of stunts that generated multiple
1581760	1586760	complaints about his behaviour, as many online maligned him, Team 10 seemed to lean into its status,
1586760	1591760	with Jake being the main spokesperson for them, continuing to be a nuisance even when other people in the real world
1591760	1593760	tried to consult him about it.
1593760	1597760	Jake, I wouldn't do that. I wouldn't crawl up there.
1597760	1598760	Why?
1598760	1599760	I just wouldn't do that.
1599760	1602760	A lot of the neighbours are complaining, they're very upset.
1602760	1603760	No, why?
1603760	1609760	They say that you've created a living hell out here, that it's like a circus.
1609760	1610760	Yeah, it is.
1610760	1611760	All the fans.
1611760	1613760	I mean, but people like going to circuses, right?
1613760	1617760	Interviews with the mainstream media had gone from these relaxed dialogues to borderline bedlam.
1617760	1621760	Drama that had previously been contained within the YouTube platform was spilling over in all directions,
1621760	1625760	and everyone continued to amplify its coverage over the entirety of social media.
1625760	1630760	Team 10 obviously enjoyed continued strong viewership over this period, however, there were real world
1630760	1635760	consequences for this publicity, the most notable being Disney's decision to sever ties with Jake Paul,
1635760	1641760	ending his work on Bizaardvark, further enshrining this image as this out of control celebrity with a gang of hooligans.
1641760	1648760	He's just going around like a wrecking ball, being an absolute douchebag to people in public,
1648760	1655760	and everything that he does, he's just like this fucking ego-brained, just has no perception of what it's like
1655760	1659760	to be a respectful, decent human being in society.
1659760	1665760	And, you know, Jake Paulers would call that savage, you know, dab on those motherfucking haters,
1665760	1667760	I call it being a fucking loser.
1667760	1670760	That's just how I was raised.
1670760	1675760	Jake Paul said there wouldn't be a response to Alyssa Violet, but in a way, the heightened stunts and the consequences
1675760	1678760	that resulted from Team 10's involvement in them were just that.
1678760	1682760	It was a statement of legitimacy that sought to invalidate the criticism that Team 10 were just another
1682760	1688760	flash in the pan collective coasting off their 15 minutes of fame, but could they ever fully avert that?
1688760	1694760	Not everything that you see in the media on a day-to-day basis is real, and that you could basically fake anything
1694760	1697760	and twist everything the way you want.
1699760	1703760	Understanding what made Team 10 tick requires an understanding of the actual power dynamics between Jake
1703760	1708760	and the rest of the crew members. By that should have been apparent, the Team 10 didn't exist because they were all besties.
1708760	1713760	This was a business venture, and led at the helm by an intrepid influencer who was willing to put everything at stake
1713760	1718760	for the success of it. Jake Paul had outwardly stated his intent multiple times to create a network which would
1718760	1723760	maintain a hierarchy of younger talent beneath him, and at the time Team 10 appeared to be a model that would
1723760	1726760	optimise that. However, were the cracks starting to show?
1726760	1730760	As aforementioned, there are many benefits to working within a group, particularly when curating fandoms
1730760	1734760	who want to see personalities building off each other, the monetisation of such networks is incredibly
1734760	1739760	lucrative for all those involved. This income is typically a motivator to keep these sets of people together,
1739760	1744760	but at the same time, if a collective becomes too popular, then individual members may feel that it is in their best interest
1744760	1749760	to go solo. Jake Paul had to walk a tightrope of making Team 10 famous enough to be a worthy investment,
1749760	1754760	but also reliant on him for that fame to the extent that people wouldn't just walk out. The members themselves
1754760	1759760	would have felt empowered by the success of Team 10, but also somewhat hesitant to change the status quo,
1759760	1764760	out of fear that their prosperity may not carry over into their solo ventures, and who can blame them given the many
1764760	1766760	techniques that Jake himself employed.
1766760	1794760	Although he obviously wanted the presence of Team 10 for his many antics, in interviews he would still be quite
1794760	1800760	possessive over the fandom, even when surrounded by his peers, you'd hear the term Jake Paulers rather than Team Teners.
1800760	1806760	Now, the former does roll off the tongue better, but that's not the reason why he uses the term, in this case it's all about
1806760	1811760	control. It's the same reason he used his main personal channel to upload a significant amount of Team 10 content,
1811760	1817760	he wanted to conflate the success of Team 10 with his own, so there was a sense of dependency on Jake.
1817760	1822760	He didn't want people to just join, acquire success, and leave, but now as someone who did just that, and being
1822760	1828760	noticeably vocal about it, there was a sense that maybe this structure that Paul had set up was looking somewhat fragile.
1828760	1833760	Although simultaneously being the public and private face of a business may have seemed like an advantageous position
1833760	1838760	at the start of Team 10, as it enabled a close relationship with the public perception, it also eventually made him
1838760	1843760	quite vulnerable, particularly when he became infamous amongst online communities, and it became beneficial for people
1843760	1848760	to talk shit about him. There are many managers in the industry who are real disciplinarians, for many it's seen as a
1848760	1854760	standard for them to maintain a public image, I'm sure there are some who are quite unpopular for it, but for Jake,
1854760	1860760	when his public image was skewered, so was his private enterprise, influencers are far less likely to go on record and
1860760	1864760	complain about a corporate executive. Jake Paul on the other hand was a prime target.
1864760	1869760	By making a video on the matter and the subsequent diss track with RiceGum, Alyssa Violet seems to set a precedent for the
1869760	1876760	attention that could be generated just by leaving, and aligning herself with those who may be hostile to Team 10 and Jake Paul.
1876760	1881760	At the same time, she also had reduced the novelty of such an action, and actually appeared to possess legitimate
1881760	1886760	justification for it, so even though there may be some who seem tempted to walk away, Jake's newfound commitment
1886760	1891760	to the image of Team 10 may have won them over for the moment, but how much could Jake do to convince them that
1891760	1892760	they were better together?
1897760	1902760	Well let's talk about loyalty, it's clearly a trait that Jake Paul values in a team member, provided that the loyalty
1902760	1907760	is to him and not from him. Generally, that was presented as the reason that Alyssa Violet had been ejected from
1907760	1912760	the house in the first place. Come August, it appeared she had properly moved on from Team 10, and had entered into a
1912760	1917760	relationship with the content creator FaZe Banks, who was also heavily enshrined in the Los Angeles scene.
1917760	1922760	Despite supposedly referring to her in It's Everyday Bro, Jake has since made a point of not addressing her,
1922760	1928760	leading with a peace and love philosophy that was always evident in his content. On August 18th, he put out a post
1928760	1933760	on his Twitter, appearing to show remorse for his actions over the past few months. He stated that he had learned
1933760	1938760	that words could indeed be very powerful, and that he would be more mindful of his words going forward.
1938760	1943760	What was his reason for doing this? Was it a heavy issue weighing on his conscience?
1943760	1944760	Well.
1944760	1955760	Long story short of it is that Meg was assaulted by a man last night, who is in the same community and space as us.
1955760	1960760	And it's not like, if you guys see, she literally has a bruise, I don't know if you can see on camera, like here,
1960760	1964760	not to be like dramatic, but like she literally has a bruise on the side of the whole entire neck.
1964760	1970760	The same day, you see, Jake released a video titled, My Assistant Was Assaulted. A pretty serious accusation,
1970760	1975760	once again it was embedded in a standard vlog, so there's lots of typical shenanigans before this sobering sit down
1975760	1980760	with the solemn faces and the still camera, where Jake discloses more details relating to this incident,
1980760	1982760	including the alleged perpetrator.
1982760	1990760	When I was leaving, he sort of clotheslined me and put their arm out in front of me, and tried to like pull me
1990760	1996760	into the place that they were, into his table. I was looking up at him and our faces were really close,
1996760	1998760	and he sort of like was right here.
1998760	2003760	I feel like it was more extreme. He didn't know you, doesn't know you.
2003760	2008760	I've never met him before, I just know who he is because he's well known in our same community.
2008760	2012760	In this video, Jake and his peers explain that during his assistant's outing to the club,
2012760	2017760	she'd spotted FaZe Banks making out with a girl who wasn't Alyssa, and then while on her way back from the bathroom,
2017760	2022760	she'd run into Banks who clotheslined her, leaving a very noticeable bruise on her neck.
2022760	2027760	The thing is though, it's not even internet beef. He doesn't even know who Meg is.
2027760	2028760	Meg is behind the scenes.
2028760	2034760	Literally, it just so happens that she is my assistant and works here.
2034760	2040760	And so, what's crazy about this is that if it wasn't her, this message would have never been spread.
2040760	2045760	This type of thing could have kept on happening. It could have spiralled into a lot worse things.
2045760	2049760	It just sickens me, but I don't know if there's more to the story.
2050760	2055760	Jake quickly dismisses ideas that this has anything to do with Team 10's ongoing disputes with Banks and Alyssa,
2055760	2059760	stating there was no way that Banks could have even recognised his assistant to the club,
2059760	2061760	and that this could have happened to any female.
2061760	2066760	Jake Paul was just standing up for women all around the world.
2066760	2071760	This video isn't meant to retaliate or target anyone.
2071760	2076760	It's not about that. It's not about revenge or starting a drama or beef or anything.
2076760	2082760	It's about how important this message is to get out there, and we're trying to figure out the situation.
2082760	2084760	But what was he really doing?
2103760	2105760	This was a very serious charge being made about a public figure.
2105760	2112760	Nick DM'd the person, police are involved, there's proof, thankfully there's cameras at this club,
2112760	2119760	and we are going to stop this and have justice and let the police take it from here,
2119760	2124760	and they're the professionals, they can handle it, but overall this situation just sucks.
2124760	2129760	It was provided even more credibility by the fact that it had come from number one feminist Jake Paul.
2129760	2132760	Additionally, Nick Crompton tweeted a screenshot to substantiate this,
2133760	2137760	adding that the police had been informed that Team 10 would never, ever lie to their fans.
2137760	2140760	However, this statement would be brought into question by FaZe Banks himself,
2140760	2143760	who would soon post a video response the following day.
2143760	2147760	With the title My Girlfriend Was Assaulted, he elaborates on the screenshot that Nick Crompton had posted,
2147760	2149760	showing that there was missing context to the message.
2149760	2152760	He said to me somewhere along the lines of,
2152760	2156760	she said she knows you didn't do it on purpose, so she doesn't think you did it on purpose,
2156760	2159760	but my assistant was at Warwick last night, it's a club in LA,
2159760	2163760	and you were there as well, and she walked by your table, and you like clotheslined her,
2163760	2166760	or did something, and you left this bruise on her neck.
2166760	2169760	So right here, Nick has lost all credibility.
2169760	2174760	Now, of course, it's very possible that a person can reflect on an event and change their mind about an individual's intentions,
2174760	2177760	but with all the intersecting factors, including Jake's ongoing feud with Melissa,
2177760	2182760	and the rather ham-fisted narrative surrounding women's rights, and being more considerate in general,
2182760	2188760	it felt like this was another rather calculated move to vilify a person who was finding success outside of Jake's incubator project.
2188760	2191760	Additionally, given that it was completely separate to the allegation of the clothesline,
2191760	2195760	the detail of FaZe Banks supposedly making out with a woman who wasn't Alyssa,
2195760	2199760	seemed like a twist of the knife into a person who had not been loyal to their beloved team.
2199760	2204760	There was no real way to avoid the fact that this seemed much more personally motivated than it had been presented.
2204760	2211760	If there was genuine concern, why would you air out that information in a public forum before talking to the affected party first?
2211760	2214760	I never thought that anybody could lie about something like this.
2214760	2218760	So initially, I responded with, wait, what? Who is that? I've never seen this person ever.
2218760	2224760	I don't remember having any interaction with this person, and this is the first time I have ever seen this human being in my life,
2224760	2227760	and it's a picture of a bruise on her neck, and I'm being told that I caused the bruise.
2227760	2232760	So I responded, I said, oh my God, holy shit, I don't remember doing that.
2232760	2239760	I don't think, I never saw her, but obviously if I did do it, it was on accident, 100% on accident, and I'm sorry.
2239760	2243760	And I asked for her on Twitter, and I tried to get in touch with her, to which Nick didn't respond to any of that.
2243760	2248760	In Banks' video, he goes into more details about this incident, explaining that he had attempted to reconcile
2248760	2253760	nearly immediately, but was not given any route to do this. Banks also provided eyewitness testimony from two of his friends
2253760	2259760	who were also at the establishment that night, which were both very differing accounts to the one presented by Jake Paul in his video,
2259760	2264760	both of whom confirmed there was no way that he would have ever made out with another girl, and that any physical incident
2264760	2268760	with Jake Paul's assistant was completely unintentional, though he doubts whether it even happened now.
2268760	2274760	I suggest that it was a possibility that members of Team 10 had spiked his drinks in an attempt to engineer the situation.
2274760	2278760	I'm sitting there minding my own business, I'm speaking to Naija, which you've seen, you're talking to Naija.
2278760	2284760	I look over at Naija, and I look back behind me, and the kid, they have you up, and you're not even paying attention to who you're making eye contact to,
2284760	2289760	and you're drinking out of the thing, and they're like, keep, keep, keep, for the next five minutes, keep feeding you alcohol.
2289760	2291760	And they were trying to just get you.
2291760	2292760	They were trying to get you complete.
2292760	2293760	Kids from Team 10, by the way.
2293760	2294760	Blacked out.
2295760	2297760	These kids actually did something to me.
2297760	2303760	Like, I really truly, in my heart, believe that these kids drugged me, or just got me way beyond drunk,
2303760	2306760	and obviously with intent, they told you they were trying to get me blacked out.
2306760	2312760	As you're likely aware, the video didn't end there, and Banks and Alissa proceeded to go into more depth about the relationship with Jake and Alissa,
2312760	2316760	revealing details that even many neutral parties would label as abusive.
2316760	2320760	Honestly, he did assault me a few times.
2320760	2326760	If we never agreed on something, or if something happened, he would spit in my face, and this has happened multiple times.
2326760	2329760	He would, like, spit at, like, my feet, the ground that I walk on.
2329760	2331760	Another time, he threw my phone.
2331760	2335760	Neil's was there, too, at this one, too, and surprisingly enough, Alex Lane was there at this one, too.
2335760	2340760	When I was living in his apartment, he took my phone, threw it at the wall, we got into a fight, I ran upstairs,
2340760	2344760	he dragged me down the f***ing stairs, and I actually have-
2344760	2346760	Yeah, that's been on your leg since I met you.
2346760	2349760	This has been here for, like, two f***ing years, dude.
2349760	2354760	Today's Banks concludes the response, stating that he will be suing Jake Paul and Team 10 for defamation of character.
2354760	2358760	In the coming days, there were further responses from all sides trying to shield their reputations,
2358760	2362760	including Logan as well, who sat down with his brother to go over their side of the story.
2362760	2367760	Eventually, Jake walked back his statements and expressed how he was actually all about positivity now,
2367760	2369760	and that this would be resolved in private.
2369760	2375760	...to handle the situation, and so I reached out to Banks directly, over text message, and we're communicating now,
2375760	2380760	and we are going to meet up, figure out how to solve this situation, we're stopping the drama, guys.
2380760	2385760	However, this was not the end for Banks, who decided to release another video titled Proof I'm Innocent.
2385760	2388760	This included an interview with a person by the name of Max Beaumont.
2388760	2393760	Max Beaumont was a member of Team 10 who had been speculated as the individual who may or may not have spiked
2393760	2398760	FaZe Banks' drink. However, amidst all the conjecture, he abruptly decided to leave the Team 10 house,
2398760	2401760	stating that he would be returning to college for a normal life.
2401760	2406760	After calling his departure, he sat down with FaZe Banks over a phone call to help clear up the events of the night.
2406760	2410760	Do you, as a person who has seen this all go down, as somebody who was there that night,
2410760	2416760	between me and you, everything that you've consumed about the situation thus far, do you believe that I did this?
2416760	2420760	I do not believe that you intentionally assaulted this girl.
2420760	2425760	I believe that, if anything, you accidentally bumped into her.
2425760	2430760	I can't explain the bruise, and she's my best friend for seven years, so it's so hard for me to say this,
2430760	2436760	but the way that I saw you that night, I do not see how it was a possibility that you went from this nice guy
2436760	2440760	who came over and gave me a hug to someone who started swinging at her afterwards.
2440760	2442760	That's my personal opinion.
2442760	2445760	And just one more thing, do you believe that I kissed somebody that night?
2445760	2446760	No.
2446760	2449760	He echoes Banks' retelling, stating that he did not see Banks cheat on anyone,
2449760	2453760	and that he also did not witness any physical incident occur with Jake Paul's assistant,
2453760	2457760	writing additional third-party testimony contradictory to that of Jake Paul and his crew.
2457760	2460760	Now, some probably said that he was trying to ease any tensions with Banks,
2460760	2462760	given that his name had been brought up in relation to the incident.
2462760	2465760	Declaring Banks' name was the best way to clear his own name.
2465760	2468760	At the same time, Beaumont was one of the founding members of the team,
2468760	2473760	he had been there for a very long time, and he seemed to lose a lot more from walking away from Team 10,
2473760	2477760	and repudiating the testimony of someone who he clearly considered to be a close friend.
2477760	2481760	Everyone knows how fleeting drama is online, and his name was only brought up in passing.
2482760	2487760	Hey man, I'm Max, I'm from Team 10, and his Instagram, it'll pop up right now, it's whoismax, right?
2487760	2488760	Whoismax, his name's whoismax.
2488760	2492760	This and the prior video did make a dent in the subscriber count of Paul and co,
2492760	2494760	with many siding against the infamous squad,
2494760	2499760	which is such a shock after Jake Paul was so determined to drop the issue and be all about peace and love.
2499760	2502760	We weren't handling the situation the right way.
2502760	2504760	But the truth is, it's not an issue of being positive.
2504760	2507760	If someone was assaulted, it would be quite a pressing matter,
2507760	2510760	and the police would be contacted if you felt it needed to be addressed.
2510760	2513760	It's an issue of honesty, and actually making sure that if an incident has occurred,
2513760	2517760	the facts are established so all relevant and proportionate action can be taken.
2517760	2521760	I don't think the video's existence was unjustified if Paul believed what he was saying,
2521760	2525760	but as the situation continued to transpire, and more details were revealed,
2525760	2527760	it became increasingly difficult to believe.
2527760	2529760	So what was the reason behind all of this?
2529760	2534760	We can assume it was personally motivated, but what would that personal motivation be?
2534760	2536760	I didn't really know whether or not it was him at first,
2536760	2542760	because he has a girlfriend, and he was making out with this other girl that I knew wasn't his girlfriend.
2542760	2545760	So at first I was confused, but then I realised it was definitely him.
2545760	2547760	Well, let's talk about it.
2553760	2556760	There are loads of self-interested reasons to start drama with a person.
2556760	2561760	Most of the time it doesn't happen because the cons of manufactured drama sufficiently outweigh the pros.
2561760	2564760	But in the case of Jake Paul, whether the allegations were true or false,
2564760	2566760	he had more than enough motive to stir the pot.
2566760	2571760	Part of it is factualism, Jake Paul's prime directive is to appeal to his audience and Team 10.
2571760	2576760	Outside the women's rights narrative, him speaking up makes it look like he is standing up for someone close to him.
2576760	2581760	Not only is this demonstrative loyalty to the people in his life, but also for those who trust his intentions.
2581760	2584760	This is the most notable thing a guy can do for his friends and colleagues,
2584760	2587760	so on one hand he has demonstrated his allegiance to his team.
2587760	2590760	However, that wasn't the only reason, and I call back to the question I asked earlier.
2590760	2596760	Why would you include the detail of your ex's boyfriend cheating on her if it doesn't actually substantiate your initial allegation?
2596760	2600760	Sure, the clothesline incident was good motivation for a video addressing this issue at hand,
2600760	2602760	but I think there's one big reason that detail existed.
2605760	2611760	We call back to Jake's plans of creating a major creator network where he works as a quasi-mentor for many creators,
2611760	2613760	facilitating their success on YouTube.
2613760	2617760	It's not an uncommon position to aspire for, but I don't think he does it out of altruism.
2617760	2623760	For a person who likely gives himself a lot more credit than he should, he always expects something in return, that loyalty.
2623760	2629760	What looked like an act of loyalty for Team 10 was actually an attempted punishment of disloyalty to Alyssa Violet,
2629760	2634760	provoking an aspect of factualism to show that those who did leave Team 10 would not just be joining the enemy,
2634760	2637760	but an enemy that had actively sought to harm Jake and his friends.
2637760	2642760	That's a difficult position for any member of Team 10 to come to terms with, but now it is significantly backfired,
2642760	2646760	and there was a sense that this situation had been used for much more insidious reasons.
2646760	2650760	A member of Team 10 had walked out of the house, and their credibility was wearing thin.
2650760	2654760	On the surface, Jake may have been trying to show more loyalty and commitment to Team 10,
2654760	2658760	but the contrience of this drama could not masquerade itself behind the very apparent truth,
2658760	2663760	that Jake was playing Game of Thrones, and its schtick was beginning to tie.
2663760	2666760	Jake, what do you think about the It's Every Night Sis song?
2666760	2667760	What is it?
2667760	2670760	It's Every Night Sis with rice gum?
2670760	2672760	Oh, I think it's great, man.
2675760	2679760	I just claimed the views on it, I'm gonna buy a new car with it.
2679760	2685760	Jake's continued anger towards people who left Team 10, yet inability to change or prevent it would confuse many reasonable onlookers,
2685760	2690760	but unfortunately most of the people who actually cared enough to spectate were not in a reasonable frame of mind.
2690760	2694760	Over August and September, there was this sense once again that Jake Paul was trying to be real.
2694760	2698760	This began with a diss track to himself, which on the surface may have seemed like a legitimate self-reflection,
2698760	2702760	but more just included him presenting his own perspective on recent matters,
2702760	2705760	and once more taking passing shots of former members.
2715760	2718760	It began very hard to almost hide the fragility of one man,
2718760	2724760	and how his fame as an individual, Crater, and his greater aspirations were continuously compromised by the actions of others.
2724760	2729760	This is a man who had given these people everything, and yet time and time again people kept walking away,
2729760	2731760	despite the fact that he treated them like family.
2731760	2734760	And when reflecting on where many of the founding members were now,
2734760	2738760	there seemed to be this growing list of alumni who had just vanished from the crew's vlogs.
2738760	2742760	No big thank yous, no glorious send off, even the people who had supposedly left on amicable terms,
2742760	2745760	one day they were there, the next day they weren't.
2745760	2750760	Most of the time you'd find out from a video on their own channel, or if Jake Paul dropped a diss on them somewhere.
2750760	2754760	If Jake treated these people like family, I'd hate to see how he treated his family.
2754760	2758760	In a way, when someone left the house for good, Jake seemed too embarrassed to even admit that it happened.
2758760	2764760	Team 10 had to look like this indomitable frat house fortress to any outsider's sources, where the banter never ends.
2764760	2768760	He was also aware of how the media would latch onto an exit en masse,
2768760	2773760	how one person leaving could easily provoke copycat incidents, and how he had to do everything to prevent it.
2773760	2779760	However, he couldn't help letting his personal biases seep into the content because that's also how he maximised the potential of his personality.
2779760	2784760	Jake Paul was allowed to be weak, he was allowed to be human, that's what made him appeal to the viewers,
2784760	2788760	talking about peace and love and his own personal struggles and being a decent person,
2788760	2793760	but when Team 10 activities ensued, it could never truly fail, even when cars were smashed,
2797760	2799760	even when fires were sent,
2803760	2805760	even when members were injured.
2817760	2824760	It could not afford to fail, but in doing so, Jake Paul split his persona down the middle and created a recipe for disaster.
2824760	2830760	What do I mean? Well, not too long after the loss of founding member Max Beaumont, a more fiery exit would follow.
2831760	2836760	So, let's talk about two very curious characters, known as the Martinez Twins.
2836760	2842760	The Martinez Twins joined Team 10 in early 2017, appearing to serve as a proxy replacement to the Dolan Twins,
2842760	2845760	who some had speculated on Jake's relationship with after they had collaborated.
2845760	2849760	In many ways, given their unique background to the rest of the team and their brotherly camaraderie,
2849760	2853760	the Martinez Twins quickly became fan favourites in the hearts of many Jake Paulers.
2853760	2859760	They had this sort of wide-eyed innocence and energy that complemented the edgier presence of people like Jake and Piers,
2859760	2863760	more seasoned with these group antics. On the surface, they seemed to be living their dream,
2863760	2867760	but it did beckon one question, what happens when you're not in on the joke?
2873760	2877760	The Martinez Twins were sort of at the forefront of the new era of Team 10,
2877760	2881760	making a rather notable appearance on It's Everyday Bro, and spinning super hot fire lyrics.
2881760	2885760	They appeared to be a part and parcel of the team's pranks and japes, however, around September,
2885760	2887760	they began to act a little out of character.
2890760	2897760	First came a diss track that appeared to be directed at some of their comrades,
2897760	2900760	however, you could easily perceive that as a joke and move on.
2900760	2903760	Not too long after, in October though, they flew back to Spain,
2903760	2907760	and their future with Team 10 appeared uncertain while they struggled to obtain visas.
2907760	2909760	They were designed to return regardless at the start of November,
2909760	2913760	but accompanied by a video that revealed that they would not be residing in the Team 10 house anymore.
2913760	2918760	Many Team 10 fans seemed disappointed by this, expressing that they would be most welcome there,
2918760	2921760	but more perceptive viewers probably realised something was up,
2921760	2925760	and barely a week after came a further video that was posted on their channel titled,
2925760	2926760	We Left Jake Paul's Team.
2926760	2930760	On the surface, this video could have a plethora of interpretations,
2930760	2933760	by now, clickbait was so second nature to the genre of content,
2933760	2936760	that they could have just been going on a day trip to Disney without the rest of the crew.
2936760	2941760	Once the video starts, you realise that this title actually does exactly what it says on the tin.
2941760	2948760	So, guys, we're no longer with Team 10.
2948760	2953760	In this unmonetised upload, they reveal that they have indeed departed the notorious posse,
2953760	2955760	but are seemingly vague about the details behind this.
2955760	2959760	With that said, from what one can gleam, the message of the video was that they had joined Team 10
2959760	2963760	under the pretense that it would be a very different experience to the one they subsequently received.
2963760	2968760	They felt that their naivety was taken advantage of by many of those in the team who found them an easy target to pick on,
2968760	2970760	deeply given how they were not fluent with their language.
2970760	2973760	However, as they became more familiar with the world in LA,
2973760	2976760	they became more disillusioned with what was offered to them.
2976760	2980760	And we went there, and it was like Team 10.
2980760	2982760	We didn't know about Team 10 before that.
2982760	2985760	We were like, yo, they're the same people like us.
2985760	2989760	They do the same as we do, and we can make content together.
2989760	2991760	We can have fun together.
2991760	2996760	We thought they could be our family, but not anymore.
2997760	2998760	You wake us up.
2998760	3000760	You just wake us up.
3000760	3001760	We're awake now.
3001760	3002760	We know everything.
3002760	3004760	We know we're used.
3004760	3005760	He's awake.
3005760	3006760	I'm awake too.
3006760	3007760	And we're pissed.
3007760	3008760	We're really pissed.
3008760	3009760	Yeah, bro.
3009760	3010760	Okay?
3010760	3011760	Because you're a bully.
3011760	3013760	If this video gets just one like.
3013760	3014760	One like?
3014760	3015760	Take.
3015760	3017760	I used to love you.
3017760	3018760	For real.
3018760	3019760	I will do the like.
3019760	3020760	I will do the like.
3020760	3021760	No, you don't have to.
3021760	3023760	If this video gets just one like.
3023760	3024760	One like.
3024760	3025760	I will tell them.
3025760	3026760	Just one like.
3026760	3028760	I will tell them.
3028760	3030760	Everything about you.
3030760	3034760	They conclude the upload with a firm commitment that if the video received one like, they
3034760	3037760	intended to reveal everything about their experience with Team 10 and Jake Paul.
3037760	3041760	Before they could, however, Team 10 posted a response to their Twitter, claiming that
3041760	3046060	what the Martinez Twins had alleged in their upload was simply not true, along with numerous
3046060	3048760	other comments expressing bemusement at this sudden betrayal.
3048760	3053560	A series of responses from members followed over the coming days, expressing similar sentiments,
3053560	3057260	including Jake Paul's parents, in what looked to be a blitz of uploads in an attempt to
3057260	3059060	discredit their claim.
3059060	3064160	We all love the Martinez Twins, we all are just shocked, no team member that I've talked
3064160	3070760	to understands what's going on, and it's quite devastated.
3070760	3073880	They were an integral part of the team.
3073880	3077440	The Martinez Twins then hit back, alluding to the idea that there would be more on the
3077440	3078940	way, and indeed there was.
3078940	3082400	On November the 14th, we were blessed with another longer upload that went into more
3082400	3085920	depth about the Martinez Twins ordeal at the hands of Jake Paul and the rest of Team
3085920	3090480	10, supported by video evidence posted by Team 10 and Jake Paul themselves.
3090480	3096040	Like Jake started to prank us every single day, we were in a room, so he started to prank
3096040	3097840	us every single day.
3097840	3105880	Like we felt so bad, like we were the only ones getting pranked, like the other ones,
3105880	3111000	they didn't get pranked at all, and we were getting pranked every single day because we
3111000	3116840	didn't say anything bad to him, we were like, okay yeah, fine, fine, fine, but when you're
3116840	3121440	like fine, fine, fine, all the time, they can do whatever you want, they can do whatever
3121440	3122440	you want to you.
3122440	3125440	When the aforementioned clips were originally uploaded, I think viewers always assume that
3125440	3128900	there is some sort of balance that ensures that nobody is disproportionately subject
3128900	3132980	to Team 10's pranks, and there is this sort of understood respect and consent to those
3132980	3134040	things happening.
3134040	3137120	Have the Martinez Twins assert that they were just too inexperienced with the culture to
3137120	3140720	actually have a choice in what was going on with their lives, they had met Jake, he had
3140760	3144560	encouraged them to come over to the United States to LA, a place thousands of miles away,
3144560	3148320	of which they didn't even speak the language, just to turn them into routine punching bags
3148320	3149320	for channel view.
3149320	3155860	And it was like the first month on Team 10, it started getting worse, they started talking
3155860	3162120	bad about us, because it was funny for them, he said to us, he was saying to us all the
3162120	3170160	time, Binner, like, we found out what was Binner, and we were like, how he's joking
3170160	3176400	about that, like, he cannot joke about that, he was saying to us, Binner, and there's in
3176400	3185220	blogs that he's calling us Martinez, Martinez, no Martinez, Martinez, so Martinez is like
3185220	3190840	Binner, but Martinez, if you can tell, our brain was like, what the hell is going on,
3190840	3195200	and we start thinking, are they joking, are they not joking, what the hell is going on,
3195200	3197760	and they say bad words, like, way worse.
3197760	3201200	This behaviour routinely involved waking them up unannounced, something that the Martinez
3201200	3204860	twins felt they were subjected to far more than any other member in the house, how they
3204860	3208220	also revealed that they were made to do some pretty uncomfortable actions under the guise
3208220	3212480	of content which they didn't really understand, and felt under pressure due to the overbearing
3212480	3214860	environment that Jake Paul had manifested.
3214860	3218640	This was particularly concerning when Jake tried to make the Martinez twins perform something
3218640	3222160	unsavoury on each other, which the Martinez twins documented.
3248640	3267620	Their treatment didn't appear dissimilar to the extremely controversial, and often
3267620	3271620	illegal hazing rituals that many frat houses employ on newer members, there's a sense
3271620	3275420	that the Martinez twins, although struggling to find their feet, wanted to be accepted,
3275420	3278520	and therefore would tolerate and do a lot more than most people would do in a normal
3278520	3282640	environment, and Jake was aware of that and used it as leverage to behave pretty terribly
3282640	3285440	towards them, because he knew they wouldn't say anything back.
3285440	3289400	Whenever they tried to take countermeasures, like locking the door or finding new accommodation,
3289400	3293000	Jake would become visibly angered, seemingly worried about the consequences it could incur
3293000	3294600	on the group's image or content.
3294600	3300060	But he was so mad when we tried to lock the door, he was like yo yo open open open, yeah
3300060	3306720	we were like okay, so and then we were like okay let's try to move to another house just
3306720	3311820	to have our privacy, to take a shower, Jake found out that he was, that we were getting
3311820	3316700	an apartment or something like that, because someone told him, so we had the meeting, Jake
3316700	3322720	was really mad to us, he was like yelling at us because we wanted to move, that he only
3322720	3328400	cared about the paparazzi that were outside, like if we move, they're gonna say all the
3328400	3333260	Martinez twins move out, oh my god Jake Paul, he didn't care about our privacy, he only
3333260	3338540	cared about himself, he used his name, himself.
3338540	3342780	He also supposedly refused them an English tutor, likely concerned they may dare to feel
3342780	3343780	empowered.
3343780	3346860	In spite of all this, they chose to remain and try their best, but the cracks were obviously
3346860	3350560	beginning to show, and this ultimately bored over when they realised that in spite of all
3350560	3354600	the bullshit they were subjected to, Team 10 were hoarding all the profits for themselves,
3354600	3357460	and lying to the Martinez twins about how they could transfer it.
3357460	3364320	I asked them about a bank account in LA, and they're like you guys don't have visas,
3364320	3369160	so you guys can- and then I found out now you can have a bank account in LA without
3369160	3375720	any permission, when you make your own money, and they took everything, they were holding
3375720	3381120	more than a Lambo, and that's the reason, like I could send that money, and I'm gonna
3381120	3386560	try to get it, but I could send that money back to Spain, and have it with my family,
3386560	3390200	and all the stuff that they wanna do, and that's the reason that it pissed me off.
3390200	3393800	They finish the video with a request, that when Jake Paul inevitably finds more members
3393800	3397640	for the Team 10 house, he should treat them better than he treated the Martinez twins,
3397640	3401280	or else he'll be stuck in a cycle doomed to repeat itself, one that would inevitably
3401280	3402960	leave him worse for wear.
3402960	3408240	You're gonna have more members on Team 10, okay? I want you to treat them right, I want
3408240	3415120	you to treat them not like us, because if you treat them like us, you're gonna be
3415120	3418240	alone always, and I don't want you to be alone.
3418240	3422760	The Martinez Twins video was a fiery departure from Team 10, and added them to the growing
3422760	3426480	roster of members who had left on unfavourable terms with the squad's ringleader.
3426480	3430720	By this point, you could create a whole new Team 10 with people no longer in Team 10,
3430720	3434620	and like clockwork, many jumped on this to know what it said about the once more under
3434620	3435620	fire ensemble.
3435620	3440200	You just have to look at Team 10's history to know, this is a recurring theme.
3440200	3442400	But what did it say about Jake?
3442400	3455640	When you react to this, you're not gonna say anything on your social media, because
3455640	3460720	you know, we're right, we're right, we're saying the truth, and when you say the truth,
3460720	3464000	you don't have words to say something.
3464000	3467800	In their video, the Martinez Twins hypothesised that Jake would decline to comment on their
3467800	3471960	video because he knew it to be true, however, they would be surprised as barely a couple
3471960	3475240	days after, Jake would upload a video response to Twitter.
3475240	3482240	What's up everybody, I wanna address the Martinez Twins situation, and let me start
3482240	3489640	off by saying, first of all, I'm so sorry to the Martinez Twins, nobody should ever
3489640	3496040	feel bullied, and I truly apologise for not doing a better job as a leader and as a friend,
3496040	3498800	pure and simple, I owe you guys an apology.
3498800	3502720	In this video, Jake elaborates on his feelings, and explains Team 10's previous response
3502720	3506760	as one that was a result of offence and upset that anyone could interpret his actions in
3506760	3507760	such a way.
3507760	3511440	It was bizarre that Team 10 attempted to respond before the Martinez Twins had uploaded a follow
3511440	3516480	up video and their evidence, it made Jake's walking back rather awkward, but he continued.
3516480	3521320	Jake says, I'm happy they took the time to share their feelings in the second video,
3521320	3530440	which makes things clear, but they never came to me or anyone and shared how they were feeling,
3530440	3533880	which would have resolved the situation immediately.
3533880	3537720	He states that the Martinez Twins had never come to him directly and expressed these concerns,
3537720	3541200	and that if they had, they would have been resolved immediately, although not presenting
3541200	3545000	this as a direct counter to what the Martinez Twins were saying, it does contradict their
3545000	3555440	account pretty significantly, in their video the Martinez Twins openly state that they
3555440	3559360	added a lock to the door and expressed intent to move house, both of which Jake didn't
3559360	3560360	seem to appreciate.
3560360	3564400	I know they're not overt expressions of discomfort necessarily, but if Jake is anything
3564400	3568000	like we've understood him to be thus far, he's certainly a man who can read some text,
3568000	3571160	and if you're playing pranks on someone, and then they just happen to ask if they can
3571160	3575520	move out, there's probably a reason for it, so Jake here is either denying that this request
3575520	3579880	was made, or implying that he could not draw a parallel between the two situations, something
3579880	3583800	that a lot of people found implausible, not least the Martinez Twins themselves, who found
3583800	3587300	this sudden change of tone quite surprising considering that he and the rest of the team
3587300	3590000	had flatly denied all claims at first.
3590000	3595200	We had a conversation so many times, I knew that we were feeling that way, that we were
3595200	3596200	feeling bad.
3596200	3599260	Additionally, they didn't appreciate the fact that he still declined to comment on
3599260	3603240	any of their other claims, including the racism, and the withholding of funds which they felt
3603240	3604240	entitled to.
3604240	3610440	It means that you hold our money, and you only apologise about the pranks, you said
3610440	3618080	racist things to us, and one thing, you hold my money, you hold my mom's money, I don't
3618080	3625280	even care if it's my money, I care if I can give the money to my mom.
3625360	3628640	Beyond that, though, they seemed insulted by the fact that before they'd even released
3628640	3632520	their second video, Team 10 had rushed to brand them as liars, including Jake's own
3632520	3636200	father, Greg Paul, who believed this move was orchestrated by their manager.
3636200	3643800	That Jake brought those guys to a whole other level, and they would not be anywhere near
3643800	3650400	where they are without Jake, without Team 10, and without the love and support that
3650400	3651760	they gave those guys.
3651760	3655920	In this case, it was a conflict of words, but the truth was that most evidence was readily
3655920	3659560	available on Jake Paul and Team 10's channel, which may have turned into a compilation that
3659560	3661520	for viewers, spoke for themselves.
3661520	3670960	Jake, you apologise, because you were so many times bullying us on camera, and even worse
3670960	3675920	off camera, and you said in your video that the problem was our English, and that's
3675920	3681000	why we felt more bullied, so we posted a video saying the truth, that all the things that
3681000	3683760	you did to us, that's bullying in any language.
3683760	3687640	This was not the first time that Jake had been accused of emotional abuse, and there
3687640	3689360	were definitely similarities in the cases.
3689360	3692960	Both Alyssa Violet and the Martinez Twins had been invited out to LA with the promise
3692960	3697000	of success, views, and support from Jake Paul, and in both scenarios, they found themselves
3697000	3700760	merely as cannon fodder for that content, outside of which they were often isolated
3700760	3703420	to keep them primed for future Team 10 uploads.
3703420	3706400	In the case of the Martinez Twins, however, it definitely seemed more sinister, given
3706400	3709320	that their isolation didn't just come from the fact that they were in a place they weren't
3709320	3712760	familiar with, but they were actively disadvantaged in how they could interact with others.
3712760	3716480	One of the most concerning details was the fact that Jake and others allegedly refused
3716480	3719680	them an English teacher, although I cannot look into Jake's mind and tell you the exact
3719680	3723400	reason that he might have done this, for many it almost seemed self-explanatory.
3723400	3726280	If they learned English, then they would wise up to the context of what he was doing and
3726280	3728600	probably undermine his plans for content creation.
3728600	3732520	At its heart, Team 10 was a well-oiled machine, and there were obviously people who were aware
3732520	3735160	of its integral nature, nobody more than Jake himself.
3735160	3739160	There was no way a lot of content like that would just happen naturally, however, if everyone
3739160	3742280	was in on it, then its contrivances would likely become quite obvious.
3742280	3746000	There were theories that Team 10 was fake in the sense that everyone knew exactly what
3746000	3749260	was going on, but these videos tended to tell a different story.
3749260	3752920	That story was that Jake enjoyed people who were not entirely in on the joke, he enjoyed
3752920	3756240	people who were somewhat innocent and naive, not only because fans found those sorts of
3756240	3759920	characters endearing, but he also likely knew that their desire for acceptance amongst a
3759920	3764120	popular social group would drive them to be more enthusiastic and involved in the antics
3764120	3768160	they may not have fully understood, and tolerate more Team 10 bullshit which would allow Jake
3768160	3769640	to push the content further.
3769640	3773120	It's by the allegations of Jake holding people back though, I don't doubt he knew
3773120	3777080	that eventually they would acclimatise to his shenanigans, however, in his head he believed
3777080	3780480	the growth and success that he offered would serve as a fair trade for being subjected
3780480	3781480	to the pranks he pulled.
3781480	3785800	That was one continuous miscalculation that he made, although hazing is pretty awful for
3785800	3790600	a lot of people, it does result in the induction of an individual into a group or organisation,
3790600	3793720	with some of him viewing that reward as completely worthwhile.
3793720	3797480	Yet Jake appeared to conflate statistical reward with emotional reward, maybe because
3797480	3801520	of his own perspective on the matter, maybe in his mind somewhere he believed the Martinez
3801520	3805400	Twins should just be grateful for what he did to them, he gave them clout and attention,
3805400	3808880	pranks were just part of the deal you make for being in that house, however, he fundamentally
3808880	3812920	misunderstood how people would interact with that behaviour, the fact that many also want
3812920	3816920	emotional validation for such actions, something that the Martinez Twins emphasised.
3817360	3822520	Prank someone, you can prank someone and then say, sorry, I'm so sorry, I'm gonna clean
3822520	3826560	it up, sorry, you can prank me back, like I pranked my brother in my blocks, and you
3826560	3832040	can see, I pranked my brother, and we pranked back, so it's fine, but like, I will say sorry,
3832040	3838800	I will say, if I messed up, or if I, so if I messed up, I'm gonna clean it, like, don't
3838800	3844760	worry, I'm gonna do it, like, I'm sorry, but he didn't, he punched me in my face, in a
3844760	3851160	prank, but like, how you feel when you wake up, you wake up, and you have someone, someone
3851160	3855500	next to you just ready to do something, I don't want this in my life.
3855500	3859200	He never offered that reward to people who tolerated his bullshit, he never gave them
3859200	3863160	that induction, he kept that admission into his inner circle at arm's length of many of
3863160	3867680	those he tormented, and for the Martinez Twins, that became too much of an ordeal to manage,
3867680	3871360	the psychological damage was palpable, these people not really knowing where they stood
3871360	3874980	with their supposed leader, being scared of going to sleep every night, what Jake was
3874980	3880080	doing had a marked negative effect, and what was it for? Well, to maintain a dynamic that
3880080	3883720	he was happy with, however in doing so he raised serious ethical questions that many
3883720	3887520	would justifiably take issue with. Jake's response was that he assumed that this was
3887520	3891240	all a septal banter between people who would be considered friends, but the problem was
3891240	3894740	that to them they weren't friends, they were just fuel, and that was illustrated by their
3894740	3898920	perception of Jake Paul on and off camera, and the social engineering that was manufactured
3898920	3902440	by Jake Paul himself. Was this cycle doomed to repeat itself?
3908120	3911480	Over the next couple of months, this whole situation was addressed a few times by separate
3911480	3914840	people, probably the most interesting example of this was Nick Crompton, who was able to
3914840	3917040	handle himself pretty professionally on camera.
3917040	3922120	Nick Crompton- One minute everything was fine, and the next it wasn't, and I don't think
3922120	3924840	I'm ever going to know the reason behind that.
3924840	3928480	He repeated the same message that Jake did, that ultimately he wasn't sure where this
3928480	3932120	information was coming from, and once again, although not directly accusing the Martinez
3932120	3935480	twins of lying, still contradicting their claims that this was a serious problem in
3935480	3936480	their minds.
3936480	3940560	Nick Crompton- I, along with everyone else, when it happened, and even before it was happening,
3940560	3945800	I've been messaging them, and trying to figure out what's wrong, what's going on, and there's
3945800	3946800	just been no response.
3946800	3950520	When someone conveys themselves well, it's very easy to look at the situation and go,
3950520	3955200	well, maybe this was one big misunderstanding, even in spite of the compelling evidence presented.
3955240	3958840	Nonetheless, even if it was, there's still a reason why they felt they had to leave,
3958840	3962400	there must have been a reason why they thought the grass was greener, there had to be a reason
3962400	3963400	this kept happening.
3963400	3966360	What was going on, and what could be done about it?
3966360	3967360	Let's have a little flashback.
3967360	3971960	Jake- And good morning, Jake Paulers, I hope you guys are having a great day, we're gonna
3971960	3976320	kill it, make sure you're smiling, make sure you're dabbing on them haters, make sure you're
3976320	3981240	working hard, baby, and if you're new here, I'm Jake Paul, these are the Jake Paulers,
3981240	3984240	and it is lit every single day, bruh.
3984280	3988240	When the team burst onto the scene in May 2017, everyone was against him, they had something
3988240	3992400	to work towards, a goal of sorts, to cement their reputation in spite of their detractors,
3992400	3996000	there was this energy pulling the group together, this idea that there was a struggle, walking
3996000	3999500	away from a group at any point around them would have made you a traitor, especially
3999500	4001680	during the Alyssa Violet and FaZe Banks era.
4001680	4005120	At the same time, there was this sense of commitment and loyalty, people had been offered
4005120	4008800	a space and a luxurious house, they had been promised fame and followers, and that's what
4008800	4010360	they wanted to work towards.
4010360	4013760	Jake put himself out there, made himself the villain of the internet to spread their message
4013800	4018040	worldwide, and it worked extremely effectively at the time, at the start their growth would
4018040	4022220	have been rewarded in itself, but as the months passed, and the growth stagnated a little,
4022220	4025700	there was this lingering question of where Team 10 could even go from the dramatic heights
4025700	4030280	they descended throughout the mid-year, earlier I spoke about how Jake conceptualised Team
4030280	4033920	10 from a more professional perspective, and how that was somewhat abandoned as he became
4033920	4038280	more notorious as a celebrity himself, however it also began to desert what ultimately kept
4038280	4041120	Team 10 together, that notion of progression.
4041120	4045240	Alyssa Violet's departure was strictly personal, whereas the Martinez twins felt
4045240	4049080	more like a mesh between personal and professional, they had experienced all these pranks that
4049080	4053000	caused significant psychological upset, and practically received nothing in return, and
4053000	4056760	as the team's online reputation fell into the minds of disinterest amongst many online
4056760	4061180	viewers, that dissatisfaction over diminishing dividends was likely exacerbated, this was
4061180	4065360	fundamentally because Jake Paul had shifted the window of what he sought to achieve himself,
4065360	4067040	and tried to take Team 10 with it.
4067040	4069680	Jake Paul's
4069680	4078200	Initially, Team 10 was presented as a social incubator for talent, Jake Paul marketed it
4078200	4081600	as that, that he would be at the helm of the creative side, but would also be managing
4081600	4085600	these individuals as well, and making sure their full potential was realised, particularly
4085600	4089520	with the application of his business, Teamdom. The problem is that when someone feels they've
4089520	4093160	reached their full potential within the team, there is that question of what now? What was
4093160	4096880	Jake going to offer them now they've felt more confident in themselves? Jake seemed
4096880	4100480	to want to take up the Royal Talent Manager, the promoter, but because he had become so
4100480	4104260	heavily involved as a public figure, and one desperate to enshrine his status as the bad
4104260	4108640	boy of YouTube, his desire to be taken seriously as a businessman began to flounder, and this
4108640	4113240	idea of an infinite career progression inside Team 10 began to appear less and less available
4113240	4117680	to its members. Furthermore, the fame that Team 10 had generated its members, likely
4117680	4121520	more than any had ever envisioned, allowed them to establish themselves as individual
4121520	4125500	creators. No longer was the clout and the luxurious house a valid form of compensation
4125500	4129320	for one's troubles, as you become more defined as individual creators, as you find yourself
4129320	4133360	with more dedicated fans, you find yourself realising that you can bargain more. And when
4133360	4136840	people tried to do that, it seemed that this was just not really an option to Jake, who
4136840	4140880	still wanted that collective under very tight management. So what Jake was really conjuring
4140880	4144880	was a revolving door system of talent management, where people would join, grow their channel,
4144880	4148440	and then realise that there wasn't much else that Jake or Team 10 could offer them, and
4148440	4151800	walk away. Further to this, the trend of posting departure videos on the collective
4151800	4155380	made leaving the group a more notable thing, and likely made some people feel more empowered
4155380	4159440	to do so. Although possibly risking status as a traitor, Team 10's image had become
4159440	4162840	so toxic that for every person who might call you a snake, there were 10 more willing to
4162840	4166920	back you. In trying to make Team 10 bigger than anything else, Jake had unintentionally
4166920	4170820	created a leaving culture, and had done nothing to actually counteract it. It seemed that
4170820	4175280	Team 10 was on the brink, and this truth would only be proven further as the new year approached.
4175640	4179520	By Christmas 2017, although Jake had lost some pretty significant names, the core membership
4179520	4183760	of Team 10 were still intact, but every passing day that appeared more shaky, especially given
4183760	4187960	Alex Lang's choir departure at the start of December, and at the turn of 2018, they
4187960	4192080	lost two more members, Tristan, an American vlogger, and Tessa Brooks, another person
4192080	4194640	who had a verse in the notorious It's Everyday Bro.
4194640	4198560	Tessa Brooks- It's just that we've grown apart, and we're heading in different directions,
4198560	4203840	and that's totally okay, it's not something that is right for me anymore, and we just
4203920	4208720	disagree on a lot of things, and that's okay, everyone has their disagreements, I don't
4208720	4212400	regret being a part of Team 10, I don't take it back, I wish everyone had Team 10 the best,
4212400	4215520	but it's just not for me anymore.
4215520	4218960	Both of them appeared to not harbour animosity towards the team, but the message was clear,
4218960	4222480	that what was being offered to them was not anything that they felt they needed anymore,
4222480	4225920	and additionally, the fact that they probably did not move into the new place had cemented
4225920	4227760	this idea that their paths were diverging.
4227760	4232040	Alex- We had our differences, but most of all, my goals are just going in a different
4232040	4233160	direction than Team 10.
4233160	4236520	This year, I want to be working towards the goals that I set for myself when I first started
4236520	4237240	social media.
4237240	4240760	In many ways, these departures were more cutting to Team 10's image, although the
4240760	4244360	modernized twins allegations concern more serious breaches of behaviour, it gave them
4244360	4248920	something to respond to, this was just two people stating that Team 10 was not offering
4248920	4249960	them what they needed.
4249960	4253720	And if Team 10 couldn't offer two young and capable individuals a route to advance
4253720	4255720	their career, what could they offer?
4256280	4258120	Where could Team 10 go from here?
4262040	4273480	January 2018 was a rather uneventful month for Team 10, Jake tried to push viewership
4273480	4277880	with the typical on-brand hijinks, and uploaded videos that I'd call landmark content, where
4277880	4280360	Jake announces something huge that has happened in his life.
4280360	4283400	Unfortunately, he'd been through so many breakups and relationships at this point that
4283400	4287160	he was scraping the bottom of the barrel, which produced gems such as the now-deleted
4287160	4291720	I Lost My Virginity, which one can only hypothesize about the cause of the deletion of such
4291720	4292920	precious content.
4292920	4296680	In spite of all his attempts to provoke the internet, nobody was really biting that hard,
4296680	4300120	and you could put it down to inertia, but there was another reason too.
4300120	4304600	Now I can't talk about this too much because YouTube won't be very happy, at the start
4304600	4309880	of January there was an instant where Redacted Redacted went into a known Redacted Redacted
4309880	4313720	where people Redacted Redacted, and Redacted Redacted Redacted.
4313720	4318120	This mystery individual was related to Jake Paul, and apparently people's attention spans
4318120	4321000	could only sustain themselves on one Paul at a time.
4321000	4324280	And now that this had occurred, everyone's attention was elsewhere, and there was no
4324280	4328520	amount of clickbait that could supersede the outrage that Jake Paul's relative generated.
4328520	4332600	After the loss of Tessa and Tristan, Team 10 were looking noticeably leaner on the line
4332600	4336360	up front, and barely a couple days after the incident with Jake Paul's relative, and Tristan
4336360	4340680	Tessa's departure from the channel, Jake launched a new plan, something called Edfluence.
4340680	4345960	Edfluence is a course that you guys can take right now, online, how to do social media,
4345960	4351720	secrets, tips, tricks, how to be a YouTuber, how to grow your channel, all things that
4351720	4356840	have taken me years to master, you could even potentially be able to join Team 10 if you
4356840	4358040	take this course.
4358040	4362520	This was a campaign designed to create what he branded as his Team 1000, possibly of future
4362520	4366120	influencers who would be able to use the tricks that Jake Paul had used to have their own
4366120	4366920	shot at stardom.
4366920	4370200	This appeared to be Jake Paul's solution to losing some of his business credibility
4370760	4374920	on social media, and was met with anticipation by a lot of his followers, and even some aspiring
4374920	4376040	influencers.
4376040	4379560	How nearly immediately after the launch, the site was mired with technical issues and pricing
4379560	4382040	complaints, leading many to brand it a complete scam.
4382040	4385560	There was no denying its slapdash release, especially given that a community section
4385560	4389160	that Jake Paul vocally advertises in these videos didn't actually exist.
4389160	4392120	For all the time Edfluence had been in the works, the Twitter account had been active
4392120	4395080	since mid-2017, this seemed surprisingly rushed.
4395080	4398280	Was Jake aware that Team 10 was struggling, and this was a quick cash-in?
4398280	4402520	Was he trying to use it as a proxy recruitment site, or was he just trying to take advantage
4402520	4404040	of his relative's misdeeds?
4404040	4408040	One can only guess, but it felt like Team 10's membership was becoming increasingly
4408040	4412600	unstable, and on the 2nd of February, Jake decided to finally address it once and for
4412600	4412920	all.
4412920	4416760	Jake Paul- And like this video isn't meant to stir up drama, however, like, I never talk
4416760	4421640	about drama, and I never like snap back to any like haters or whatever, but I feel like
4421640	4423160	this is good to get off our chest.
4423160	4427160	As per usual, it's at the end of the video, but still somewhat significant as Jake had
4427160	4430600	often avoided even acknowledging people who had left the crew on his main channel.
4430600	4435640	He expresses his desire to clear the air and tell the truth, two phrases heavily associated
4435640	4436440	with him.
4436440	4437400	What was that truth?
4437400	4442440	Well that, surprise suckers, this was actually what he had intended all along.
4442440	4446680	Jake- But the point is, is that it is an incubator, and if you guys don't know what an incubator
4446680	4447800	is, think of a duck egg.
4447800	4453000	A duck egg gets put into an incubator, it gets warmed up, a couple months later it hatches,
4453000	4455480	and then the duck goes off on its own and lives its duck life.
4455480	4460120	Jake opens by talking about the incubator theory, and comparing it to ducklings hatching
4460120	4460760	from an egg.
4460760	4464440	When they hatch from an egg, they venture off into the world, and are no longer kept
4464440	4466280	within that Team 10 incubator.
4466280	4470280	Javi then goes on to say that these ducklings do not just go out into the world, in fact,
4470280	4475800	they are kicked out by the Team 10 High Council, who evaluate which members are worthy of staying,
4475800	4477160	and which members are not.
4477160	4481080	Jake even gets statistical, estimating that approximately three quarters of members who
4481080	4484200	had left the Team 10 house, and made videos on the matter claiming that they had left
4484200	4487560	by their own volition, were actually jumping before they were pushed.
4487560	4492760	The truth is, Team 10 is a family, and a lot of the times, the family makes a decision
4492760	4498440	as a pact on who is going to be in the team, and who isn't going to be in the team.
4499240	4503800	But the majority of the time, it's the internal members making a decision to tell another
4503800	4507880	member that like, hey, we don't think this is right, and we should go our separate ways,
4507880	4509480	that we let them do whatever they want.
4509480	4515160	They make videos saying that they're leaving Team 10, when I just am putting this out there
4515160	4518360	into the air, that 75% of the time, that is not the truth.
4518360	4522120	Jake will have you know he is very happy with the departures, and thinks that their videos
4522120	4526280	serve Team 10 excellent publicity, while also allowing him to focus more closely on the
4526280	4527640	people that he can trust.
4527640	4531400	Even if the circle had become a bit smaller, from Jake's perspective, it had only grown
4531400	4536040	stronger, and for him, this just represented a new beginning, something that he branded
4536040	4537000	Phase 2.
4537000	4541240	I think this is just the start for Team 10 as an empire, and I call this Phase 2.
4541240	4545160	As you can see, although numerous members had upped and left, some under extremely hostile
4545160	4549640	terms, everything was going according to plan, and Jake was merely separating the wheat from
4549640	4550280	the chaff.
4550280	4553800	Smash that subscribe button, join the strongest team on YouTube, and I will see y'all tomorrow
4553800	4555480	because it's everyday bro.
4555480	4560520	Jake has this incredible talent of taking an L, and presenting it as a W to his followers.
4560520	4564440	Some likely left this video feeling like they had a better understanding of his perspective,
4564440	4568600	but the truth was that even if the incubator system worked as Jake intended it to, it meant
4568600	4572920	that Team 10 had to constantly find exemplary talent, or else they would not be able to
4572920	4575000	create a long-term connection with audience members.
4575000	4579240	Jake was notably fragile about the image that members leaving would project onto Team 10,
4579240	4582200	and how that may affect their own prospects for recruiting other people.
4582200	4586360	Not all publicity is good publicity when it makes your space look like an unattractive
4586360	4587560	place to spend time.
4587560	4591160	Many members who left cited they thought this would be the place of their dreams, but were
4591160	4592520	deeply disappointed.
4592520	4595240	That is not going to look enticing to outsiders.
4595800	4599400	Additionally, all these fans created connections with certain members who left, and when they
4599400	4604120	left they had to deal with the emotional disappointment, and decide whether they could really invest
4604120	4605000	themselves again.
4605000	4608680	There was no way that system could work effectively on a long-term basis.
4608680	4612840	Jake presents these members leaving as just him trial and error testing people until he
4612840	4616520	finds the right ones, and that this was actually the start of a new era with better members
4616520	4620840	than ever, but how many of these new members at this point had actually stuck around?
4620840	4623080	What could Phase 2 even consist of?
4628520	4632200	So that's the reason why you guys see some of these videos online, that's the reason
4632200	4637080	why people make those videos, and that's the reason why Team 10 sometimes gets smaller
4637080	4641880	and smaller and smaller, but internally we just get happier, happier, closer and closer
4641880	4643720	and closer, and stronger and stronger.
4643720	4647080	We can look over the first year of Team 10 and talk about what worked and what didn't,
4647160	4651640	but Jake did make one good point, that ultimately he had a few core members who were identifiable
4651640	4655160	to many online audiences, and had a strong connection with that audience.
4655160	4658680	Jake Paul's argument was shaky, but ultimately could be perceived as valid in the way that
4658680	4662680	a lot of the people who were long-term members appeared to be actually part of Jake's inner
4662680	4665800	circle, and very few within the inner circle had ever left.
4665800	4670840	I'd say this inner circle consisted primarily of Erika Costell, Johnson Anthony, Chad Tepper,
4670840	4671800	and Nick Crompton.
4671800	4675080	Us in the group still held influence, but these were the ones who seemed to draw the
4675080	4677080	most collective presence for the team online.
4677080	4680520	They were the ones who would probably spring to mind when you mentioned those who were
4680520	4681720	actually part of the posse.
4681720	4685320	In early formats of the group, the Team 10 page was often split between the squad and
4685320	4689880	the team, the team often concerning themselves with the logistical side of operations, which
4689880	4691880	inevitably brought them closer to Jake.
4691880	4705800	Uh, I'm sorry, um, I don't know, like, how to say this, um, but it's been, like, I just,
4705800	4708040	like, wanted to call everyone here.
4708040	4719160	Sorry, uh, this whole Team 10 thing has been such an incredible journey, a year and a half
4719240	4723400	or so of, you know, family.
4723400	4727880	They had been there since 2017 at the latest, who had often been alongside Jake during many
4727880	4728920	of his controversies.
4728920	4732840	They signified a loyalty to the team that many fans would identify with.
4732840	4736360	These individuals also seemed more involved in Jake's business side, and they didn't
4736360	4738200	necessarily make a great secret of it.
4738200	4741640	With this in mind, they probably received a more personal side of Jake Paul that certain
4741640	4745800	creators who had felt bruised by his behaviour didn't, and felt like they knew him better
4745800	4749240	and could take his behaviour in a context that helped him understand it.
4749240	4752680	With that said, there were definitely aspects of the business partners in Team 10 that made
4752680	4754040	them extremely influential.
4754040	4758040	They likely knew their worth to the audience, and they knew their image was something that
4758040	4759720	couldn't necessarily be replaced.
4759720	4763400	With that in mind, they were still essential to Team 10's second phase, and none of them
4763400	4765480	seemed to be going anywhere, at first.
4766040	4770120	Team 10's monthly viewership statistics have been on a downward trend since 2017.
4770120	4774200	At their peak, they were averaging around 15 or 16 million views per day, and although
4774200	4778120	most people wouldn't turn down the viewership they were pulling at the start of 2018, it
4778120	4782440	would regularly dip to 3 or 4 million, less than a quarter of their most successful months.
4782440	4786360	Particularly for an incubator, people liked the idea that they can take enterprise from
4786360	4790200	strength to strength, and there was this sense that maybe there were not many places for
4790200	4793160	Team 10 to go after the frenzy of 2017.
4793160	4797480	Although Jake had promised a new era, the months in early 2018 were surprisingly tame,
4797480	4801800	with Jake decidedly going for a more tortured anti-hero image, launching a Team 10 tour,
4801800	4805160	and hosting interviews where he reflected on the character that he created.
4805160	4808760	Jake- I look at myself as a role model, but like an imperfect role model.
4808760	4810280	I'm gonna be real, I'm gonna make mistakes.
4810280	4814440	I think that's more realistic for kids to have a role model like that, versus someone
4814440	4818760	who just seems perfect from the outside, because these kids in school are going through a lot,
4818760	4821800	they're gonna get bullied, they're gonna maybe get a detention.
4821800	4825400	They need to be shown how to deal with that, and just always think positively, and to keep
4825400	4828360	your head up, and that's what I try to put out there.
4828360	4832920	Overall, this image was appealing to some devotees, but rather boring to others.
4832920	4837080	Probably the most notable news in early 2018 was that his former landlord sued him, claiming
4837080	4839800	excessive damages to the previous property he'd resided in.
4839800	4843560	When the news reported on this, many people in the comments seemed rather disinterested
4843560	4847160	in the affairs of Jake, some even saying that they'd forgotten about his existence.
4847160	4851240	After 2017, it just felt like there was nothing that could be done to change the trajectory
4851240	4854920	of the channel, it didn't stop them from trying, including new content, new members,
4855000	4858680	and even what appeared to be a mass deletion of videos that did briefly spike the channel
4858680	4861160	viewership, but ultimately to no avail.
4861160	4863640	However, everyone was still in for the long run, right?
4864440	4870440	Well, on the 4th of May 2018, Team 10's COO Nick Crompton posted a statement to Twitter,
4870440	4872840	entitled, It's time to move on from Team 10.
4872840	4876760	He briefly details his reason for leaving, stating that the channel is headed in a direction
4876760	4879880	that doesn't make sense to him, chalking it up to internal differences.
4879880	4883480	He openly expresses his affection for the team and Jake Paul, and states that this has
4883480	4886600	been part of his dream, and that he's extremely grateful for the opportunity.
4886600	4890520	Overall, it seems quite a nice departure as departures go, but it wouldn't undermine the
4890520	4894040	fact that Team 10 just lost one of their most influential figures, and it wasn't going to
4894040	4896200	become any easier in the coming days.
4896200	4901800	But as time goes on, and you know, things change, people change, like my goals and views
4901800	4906440	changed, I've just decided my path is a little bit different from what the team's path is,
4906440	4910360	and that was the main reason, that was like my deciding factor in leaving.
4910920	4915400	On the 8th of May, Chance Sutton announced his departure in another Twitter post titled,
4915400	4917640	Thank you Team 10, love heart.
4917640	4921160	Once again, there were a lot of platitudes for Team 10 and Jake, but ultimately Chance
4921160	4924840	had decided that he needed to focus on his own career and bid the group adieu.
4924840	4928680	As an additional note, the head of engineering also announced his departure on the same day,
4928680	4932920	which once more marked a rather strange simultaneous exodus of a few pretty high profile
4932920	4933400	members.
4933400	4937880	As a matter of fact, every performer other than Jake on It's Everyday Bro had now left.
4937960	4942200	Rumours surrounding it would have provoked multiple exits in such a short period of time.
4942200	4947000	Something about Phase 2 had clearly rattled a fair few people, but without further information,
4947000	4948600	one could only speculate.
4948600	4952920	Fortunately, we didn't need speculation, and the culprit decided to make himself known,
4952920	4958280	and it was none other than Jake's father, Greg Paul, who claimed to have uncovered the truth.
4958280	4962760	Yo, what's going on people? GP coming at you.
4962760	4967000	According to his subtweet, he had conducted an internal audit, and that he had seemingly
4967000	4971800	uncovered details of financial recklessness, even implying some form of embezzlement?
4971800	4975880	Nick Crompton wasn't happy with this, and angrily tweeted back that it wasn't the audit that people
4975880	4979960	had a problem with, it was about that Greg Paul was an all-round extremely unpleasant person to
4979960	4982360	deal with, and had next to no communication skills.
4982360	4987160	Greg was an interesting person to draft in, maybe because he would fundamentally run perpendicular
4987160	4989080	to those of Jake's loyal inner circle.
4989080	4993080	His only stakes are his son's wellbeing, and if he felt that people weren't doing their jobs right,
4993080	4995720	then he has very little to lose in being cutthroats.
4995720	5000840	But Jake Paul did. I don't know Team 10, I don't know if Greg had a point, but regardless of the
5000840	5005560	fingers and the pies, he had just fundamentally caused a departure of at least two of the team's
5005560	5009960	most influential figures. Regardless of their business practice, they still meant a lot to the
5009960	5013960	image of the team, and Nick Crompton's swift smackdown of Greg was probably the most indicative
5013960	5016360	of where public sentiment lay on it.
5016360	5020840	Greg may be an excellent businessman, but he is not a public figure, and his indirect gusting of
5020840	5025320	the team may have been a financially frugal move short term, but it had just jeopardised the future
5025320	5027720	of this phase, and one person knew it.
5027720	5034520	So, over the past couple of days, I'm sure you guys have seen, there's been members leaving Team 10.
5034520	5041960	INTRO
5041960	5046360	On the 13th of May, Jake Paul took to YouTube once more to upload a response to the sudden
5046360	5051800	departures of individuals, entitled, My Response and the Truth About Members Leaving Team 10.
5051800	5056680	As usual, it's placed on the typical vlogging escapades, however, unlike other responses and
5056680	5060840	sections, this part takes up two thirds of the video's runtime, and seems to have a rather
5060840	5064200	disparate tone to the rest of the content addressing these matters.
5064200	5071640	People's goals and things change, and sometimes that change causes people to grow apart from each
5071640	5079160	other, and for me, the way that I'm changing is I had bigger vision.
5079160	5083080	At a glance, his message doesn't seem particularly different, he goes for the spin that these people
5083080	5087080	leaving was actually a favourable outcome, it signified growth and progression for those
5087080	5091560	involved, and he personally welcomed that as, to him, change was an inherently positive force.
5091560	5095000	His explanation on the departure of certain members appears to align with that of Nick
5095000	5098520	Crompton, that ultimately the trajectory of the team had been adjusted, and some members
5098520	5102520	felt like they didn't identify with those goals anymore. To him that was an acceptable discord,
5102520	5107480	but it was also irreconcilable in his mind, so the only option was to go their separate ways.
5107480	5111880	As the video, it once again plays into this idea that Jake Paul has all this planned out and under
5111880	5116360	control, his vision has become greater than that of those around him, and he is satisfied with the
5116360	5121400	outcome, even if he is sad to lose the company of some old friends. Jake Paul-"All of my energy
5122440	5128840	is focused on changing right now, and building the new, and going in a new direction, and
5128840	5134600	innovating, and being on top of the game." Nevertheless, this video was distinctly different
5134680	5138360	to other content that tackled disputes between the team and other creators. First of all,
5138360	5142440	gone were those who often flanked Jake, providing that sort of strength and reinforcement to what
5142440	5146280	he was saying. Second, gone were the cuts and edits that allowed Jake to make his narrative
5146280	5149720	as short and efficient as possible. However, most telling was the fact that although Jake
5149720	5154360	presented his perspective as one of the sepsis of confidence, his tone seemed surprisingly unsure
5154360	5160120	of itself and vulnerable. Jake-"Some of the people didn't necessarily agree with where I wanted to go,
5160760	5169240	or what my vision was. I totally respect that. I didn't want to persuade anybody into believing
5169240	5178200	in my vision. Sometimes my visions and ideas scare people because of how crazy they are."
5178200	5182200	Now, in a way, it makes some semblance of sense if Jake wishes to present a more authentic version
5182200	5185720	of himself when responding to this, but the uncertainty present as Jake rambles for
5185720	5189800	approximately 20 minutes is far more disconcerting than reassuring. At the same time,
5189800	5193800	as someone who's always seemed calculated with his content, there had to be something symbolic
5193800	5197960	about his choice to go it alone. He still has members of his team, and even a couple of his
5197960	5202360	inner circle that would readily back him up with these decisions. But maybe the truth was that
5202360	5207480	after such disruption, he didn't know who to trust anymore. Jake-"And as I was bringing on these
5207480	5214200	older business advisors and people to help me with my company, a couple of them advised me to
5214840	5219560	bring somebody on into my corner who wanted nothing else but to protect me,
5219560	5226120	who didn't care about my money, who I could 100% trust no matter what. And so the only person I
5226120	5232040	could think of, the only person that is right for that job was my dad. Not to run my businesses and
5232040	5242120	be in charge, but to simply look over the shoulders of other people who were in my businesses,
5242120	5249320	who I'm entrusting to run my business, because I knew my dad would have my best interests at heart."
5249320	5253400	The video was a rather futile show of strength. He emphasized the need to have people who shared
5253400	5257320	his vision around him, but the problem was, if he didn't have enough people supporting that vision,
5257320	5261720	how was he going to make it there? I don't think he knew exactly. Jake-"I have big goals. Like,
5262840	5269160	I really, really have found recently that I am so passionate about music. And again,
5269160	5275960	I just want to surround myself with people, again, who have way more experience than me,
5275960	5282200	who have way more relationships than me, who have tasted victory and business success in this
5282200	5287080	industry." In June, Jake attempted to launch a live show fittingly called Team 10 Live. However,
5287080	5291000	by now it was clear that the team was looking rather emaciated. Although no announcement of
5291000	5295000	departure had been made, brothers Nathan and Cade Spicer were not present at any of these shows,
5295000	5299000	causing many to assume that they had also made their exits, and leaving Jake Paul's squad with
5299000	5303080	six members, which other commentators were more than happy to point out. The narrative
5303080	5306760	was no longer that Team 10 were the worst collective to grace people's computer screens,
5306760	5309880	it was that they were dying, and they were not sure what to do about it.
5311080	5317320	There's a pretty beautiful irony in the fact that more than half of Team 10's most iconic song
5317320	5322840	is performed by people that are no longer in Team 10. For some reason on the website it says,
5322840	5328200	Team 10 tour 2018, as if to suggest that there will be more tours in the future.
5329080	5335560	I just can't imagine a world where that happens. I think this was a one and done kind of deal,
5335560	5339000	and if it is, I guess I'm happy I got to be a part of history.
5339000	5343000	Over the next few months, Team 10 continued to falter and stagnate, and although Jake expressed
5343000	5347400	no hostility towards former members in his May upload, as summer 2018 approached its end,
5347400	5351400	Paul's attitude towards those who had left Team 10 behind appeared increasingly bitter.
5351400	5356520	No, I think if you think about it, if Team 10 were together right now,
5358040	5361640	it would be bigger than the Kardashians.
5361640	5365320	First of all, on True Geordie's podcast where he claimed that Team 10 had the potential to be as
5365320	5369080	big as the Kardashians, which is a strange statement to make about a group of people
5369080	5373000	who you insisted that its whole purpose was to incubate towns and let people go whenever
5373000	5377240	you felt like it, and yet in spite of all this, Jake still had a spin, claiming that it was those
5377240	5379320	who left who were the real failures.
5379320	5385240	Till this day, I haven't made a single dollar off of Team 10. I've only invested my own money
5385240	5390520	into it to make it successful. And they're like, oh, like, you owe me this, you dah, dah, dah,
5390520	5399000	like, dah, dah, dah. Like, there's so much like back and forth, and it's all I wanted to do is
5399000	5405640	create a platform for people to like accomplish their dreams. And a lot of them have, but they
5405640	5411240	still don't, they don't, I don't think they realize like what they had until it was gone.
5411240	5416200	Those people needed Jake to succeed, and now he's sure they're realizing the errors of their ways.
5416200	5418520	Why don't they just come crawling back already?
5418520	5427160	And I think like, as we've seen like members leave Team 10, you see them all turn into nothing,
5427160	5434680	and make mistakes, and fumble, and then I think they're like, oh shit, like,
5435800	5439800	maybe what I had was amazing.
5439800	5443080	This perspective was reiterated in Shane Dawson's Jake Paul series,
5443080	5446040	where Jake once again claims that those who left had used him.
5446040	5448920	I'd say like everyone who's left has used us.
5448920	5452920	Yeah, because they think they can go on and do something better, and then it's like...
5452920	5458040	I don't think they realize that they like used us, but when these people come into Team 10,
5458040	5459480	I give them everything.
5459480	5463480	Now, maybe they did, maybe they didn't, but the truth of the matter was that Jake Paul's shift
5463480	5467560	in tone signified that his perspective had shifted, before he was looking for reasons
5467560	5471880	why Team 10 would still be successful, and how actually everything was going according to plan.
5471880	5475480	Now, though he's too proud to admit it at the time, he had clearly come to terms with the fact
5475480	5479640	that Team 10 was failing, and he was looking for people to blame, but as the person who proclaimed
5479640	5484120	that they had the final say, the buck stopped at him, and he seemed incapable of tending to
5484120	5488600	the continued bleeding of numbers, some of whom even warned him that this scenario would repeat
5488600	5493400	itself. At first Jake lost a couple members he was able to replace fairly easily, even perhaps
5493400	5497240	enhancing the crew, then he lost a few more members who ultimately left a mark with viewers
5497240	5502120	who cared about them and invested their emotions and finances into the group, but finally he lost
5502120	5506600	integral members who he cared about and trusted more than he was prepared to admit, and members
5506600	5510920	that he was unable to replenish and admit back into his inner circle. Jake's team remained at
5510920	5515080	a roster of six for the summer, and the start of autumn, but come mid-October during Shane
5515080	5519640	Dawson's documentary series, the fate of Team 10 would be decided once and for all.
5519640	5537480	I suppose we should talk about the Shane Dawson documentary for a moment,
5537480	5540120	as there is the significance of its relationship with Team 10.
5540120	5546840	I just feel like I was like a pawn in like their game like they're always trying to one-up
5546840	5553320	each other always like so like I was just like a goal like I was
5554680	5561720	just used the whole time in Team 10 in videos and Logan's videos and everyone's I was just like
5562920	5566600	I don't know it was like they're playing a game and they're like the chess masters or whatever
5566680	5568680	and I was just a little fun.
5570920	5573800	Throughout the series, there were a variety of interviews with former members who had left under
5573800	5578520	certain circumstances, and there were occasional revelations that added context to past situations,
5578520	5582760	including that Alyssa Violet had slept with Logan Paul, Nick Crompton claiming all the pranks were
5582760	5586920	fake, and Jake alleging that Chance Sutton had stolen a joint account from him. These potentially
5586920	5591240	added context to previous scenarios and maybe gave Jake more footing to respond to them. Throughout
5591240	5595080	the series, there had been emphasis on Jake's relationship with past and present members within
5595080	5599000	Team 10. There were many questions swirling on how the depleted team were going to emerge from
5599000	5603480	this. While so many rumours surrounded their future, they would receive an answer very soon.
5603480	5608280	On October 18th, although no formal announcement was made, all of Team 10's socials were wiped
5608280	5612840	completely, with a message posted on their now inactive Instagram that a new team would be coming
5612840	5617160	soon. At the time, this news was taken with a grain of salt by many following the situation at hand,
5617160	5621400	partly because this coincided with the climax of Shane Dawson's documentary series, with many
5621400	5625240	assuming it to be a marketing plot to promote whatever Jake had planned. It's a reasonable
5625240	5629240	theory, because it almost certainly would have worked, and Jake seemed to be taking aim at former
5629240	5633000	members of the house again on social media. But as the final episode of this show aired,
5633000	5637000	people didn't exactly receive what they expected. It featured Shane sitting down with Jake,
5637000	5641160	asking the questions, and allowing Mr Paul to respond to nearly every major controversy
5641160	5645080	that featured himself in Team 10, many of which he never fully addressed at the time,
5645080	5647560	including those involving present and former members.
5665640	5669080	There are a lot of ways to interpret his responses, some of which you will not find
5669080	5673560	satisfactory, as he does hold steadfast on points that many people feel strongly about,
5673560	5677400	such as the claims made by the Martinez twins, which Jake dismisses as banter.
5677960	5682200	On other situations, like his relationship with Alyssa Violet, Jake seems more contrite,
5682200	5686120	admitting that her affair with Logan was only a response to their own toxic relationship.
5686120	5690040	He navigates a variety of situations with different levels of defiance and remorse,
5690040	5693240	even making a statement by deleting their face bank to upload on video.
5693240	5706120	However, probably the most relevant details are the plans that Jake has for his future.
5707000	5712920	For me, that's why I want to completely disconnect from all of this social media shit right now,
5712920	5717720	is to figure that out. What do I really like to do? What do I really want to do?
5717720	5721640	What's next for me? It's like you said, it's like starting over.
5723000	5727320	There is a sense that, at this moment, Jake had already made up his mind on the fate of Team 10,
5727320	5730280	and although this upload followed the wiping of their social media presence,
5730280	5734440	it was recorded before and almost served as a retrospective justification of itself.
5734440	5738680	The only significant detail that seemed to imply otherwise was this idea that a new Team 10 was in
5738680	5742920	the works. How could Jake walk away from something saying he didn't want another Leaving Team 10
5742920	5747240	video, but still wanted another Team 10? How could you have one without the other?
5747240	5750760	It was hard to look at this and not expect another Team 10 almost immediately after the
5750760	5754600	conclusion of this series, and barely a month after the disbandment of Team 10,
5754600	5759720	Jake Paul posted a tweet that read, Season 3, November 25th. This led to many online
5759720	5763400	concluding that this was the next roster. It made sense as Jake had retained ownership of
5763400	5767320	the Team 10 house, with a few people even moving in. However, when the date came around,
5767320	5769800	people got something very different to what they were expecting.
5770440	5775000	For the past, like, month or so, Erika and I's relationship has been, like, super rocky.
5775560	5779400	Like I said, it turned into this, like, downward spiral where we were just, like,
5779400	5783960	super super toxic for each other, and we, like, know everything about each other,
5783960	5790520	and, like, we know how to hurt each other, and it's so sad that it got to that point, but it did.
5793480	5798120	Season 3 was, in fact, another documentary-style series which covered Jake Paul himself,
5798120	5802440	his personal life, and his relationship with Erika Costell. It had been announced a few weeks
5802440	5805960	prior that they had broken up, and Jake had teased the reasons for this on his channel,
5805960	5809400	but in the end, what people received was a two-episode drama fest which Jake Paul
5809400	5813960	discontinued for being too real. There was no prominent mention of Team 10, just Jake and a
5813960	5818200	bunch of his friends trying to navigate the waters, a relationship that was beyond saving.
5818200	5821640	Over the next few months, it's seen that Jake Paul was quietly taking apart the constructs
5821640	5825640	that he had built Team 10 on previously, and had something else in mind, but nobody was sure what
5825640	5830120	at this point. Jake Paul himself was in and out of the news, but for no particular reason other than
5830120	5831480	it being Jake Paul.
5831480	5835640	Jake Paul- Go to mysterybrand.net if you want to win some mystery boxes,
5835640	5838120	this video was so much fun, thank you so much for watching, I love you guys,
5838120	5839800	and I will see you tomorrow with another video, peace!
5839800	5842840	Jake Paul- This has got to be one of the worst things I've seen on YouTube, simply because his
5842840	5845320	fans are so young and so impressionable.
5845320	5848120	There were crickets for months until a February vlog titled
5848120	5852520	Dear YouTube, I've Been Hiding This From You, when Jake began opening up on the reasons why
5852520	5854280	Team 10 was brought to an end.
5854280	5858120	Jake Paul- A lot of the reason why Team 10 started to fall apart is because I wasn't able to connect
5858120	5864200	with a lot of the members as people, and so I didn't understand or I wasn't able to judge
5864200	5867640	whether they were good people or not, because I just was like, business, business, everyone's
5867640	5871800	gonna win, everyone's gonna grow and do amazing stuff, and then you come to find out and you see
5871800	5878040	bad traits and bad qualities in people. I also wasn't mature enough to be able to understand
5878040	5883960	feelings and love and emotions and stuff like that, because I just got looped into business
5883960	5885960	when I was 16 years old.
5885960	5889480	What was said in this video wasn't necessarily a surprise, and seemed to line up with the
5889480	5893400	observations that could be made towards the end of its time in the spotlight. Jake possessed
5893400	5897400	serious trust issues with members and couldn't reconcile them. He felt like he couldn't continue
5897400	5901720	this knowing who people really were, and thus he felt the only option was to bring the famous
5901720	5906520	and infamous crew to an end. It appeared that this time there was no grand scheme, no immediate
5906520	5913080	reboot, no hilarious prank, this is the way that Team 10 had ended. Not with a bang, but a whimper.
5913080	5917240	And to be honest, I think that's always how Jake Paul saw it as ending, he never enjoyed the
5917240	5921960	narrative of a dramatic collapse, he'd much prefer to end a project quietly and move on to the next
5921960	5926440	one. Maybe that was the play, to leave everyone expecting something that wasn't coming.
5926440	5931240	Jake Paul-"And that's like where there was kind of like a disconnect with a lot of the Team 10
5931240	5935640	members, and even with like my best friend like Chance for example, it was just like this weird
5935640	5939800	thing for all of us to get used to, and we weren't able to get used to it, so that's where a lot of
5939800	5944920	like weird stuff came from." But of course, he doesn't normally talk about something without reason,
5944920	5949240	and at this point, the conversation takes a turn once more towards Jake's future plans,
5949240	5951480	revealing what was indeed coming up.
5957160	5963000	Jake Paul-"I'm in a position, I'm 22 years old now, and who I want to be and where I see myself being
5963000	5967240	a couple years from now is very different than what I'm doing now." In his video, Jake seemed to
5967240	5971880	reflect on the failure of Team 10 as a result of too many emotionally immature people under one
5971880	5976200	roof. It's hard to know how exactly he's grown from this, but one might say that age and experience
5976200	5980760	is its own form of maturity. Responding to a question asked by a fan, he seems confident that
5980760	5985080	the next Team 10 will not be caught by the pitfalls that the previous one was, promising that
5985080	5990760	it will be bigger and better than ever. Jake Paul-"We are working on a new Team 10 guys, we're still
5990760	5996200	figuring it out, it's still very early stages, but I love Team 10, it's a genius idea, it creates like
5996200	6001960	such an amazing vibe in the videos, and I want to bring that vibe back, and know that when I do
6001960	6006040	bring it back, it's going to be better than ever, and it will be bigger than ever, and it's just
6006040	6010520	gonna be smarter and well done, and I learned from my mistakes in the past, and I want you guys to
6010520	6015480	just trust me as I rebuild the Team 10 that it's gonna be dope." However, otherwise, it didn't seem
6015480	6019640	like Jake was planning on changing too much, committing to the vibes that had made the previous
6019640	6023480	one a success. As you noted in this video, it was still in its early stages, and other than
6023480	6028920	Jake Paul offering an internment, I mean internship, that would be paid in fun, there wouldn't be much
6028920	6033240	public development on this until the end of May, where a trailer was posted on Jake Paul's channel
6033240	6040040	foreshadowing the new Team 10, and how they would be presented. Jake Paul-"People don't understand
6040040	6044360	how hard it is to rebuild this company, the pressures, the shit that's on my plate, I don't have
6044360	6050280	a roadmap in front of me of how to do this shit, and it's fucking stressful." This seemed to take
6050280	6054680	inspiration from the cancelled Jake Paul and Cut series from November, and they also mostly erased
6054680	6059240	from the internet to Team 10 TV, which involved the original members. It seemed to focus more on
6059240	6064280	this dramatic portrayal of Team 10 under the guise of reality. It was a bit unclear what exactly the
6064280	6068680	show was going to be at this point, but there was a focus on Jake Paul and his then girlfriend Tana
6068680	6073000	Moncho, who had recently gone public with their relationship. Tana's involvement would be confirmed
6073000	6077800	a week later with a video posted onto Team 10's channel titled, Tana is joining Team 10.
6077800	6081560	Unfortunately, I can't say too much else about the video because it seems to be lost to time.
6081560	6086840	However, on June the 1st, Jake Paul posted Meet The New Team 10, introducing his new entourage to
6086840	6097320	the entire world. Jake Paul-"The problem is, it's hard to find actual good Team 10 talent
6098280	6106280	who work hard, want to be here, don't have egos, have a talent, have the right look, are the right
6106280	6112440	age. It's like there's almost like no way to find them." There are a variety of intro reels for these
6112440	6116760	people who many will know barely anything about. Lots of clips of them going about their lives in
6116760	6121160	the sort of shaky cam drama that many people who are interested in reality TV will be all too
6121160	6139640	familiar with. It seems Jake wants to embrace the chaos and make it part of what Team 10 is known
6139640	6143480	for. Whereas in the past, Jake attempted to control the narrative surrounding his squad,
6143480	6147800	here he wants the narratives to create themselves from the authentic interactions between figures
6147800	6152040	within the house. The roster of members appeared to be more mature this time, including the couple
6152040	6156440	Tram and Core, whose son Tidus would regularly make appearances on Jake Paul's channel as well.
6156440	6160440	In his February video, Jake stated he was trying to reconcile his maturing audience,
6160440	6165000	the reality show style seemed to be the solution. On principle, it seemed like a good idea. One of
6165000	6169400	the greatest conflicts from within Team 10 was that the group often appeared blindsided by drama
6169400	6173720	and tension. Team 10's proclamations of strength and good vibes were often undermined by people
6173720	6178520	stating otherwise in exit videos. In this case, the drama would be integrated into Team 10,
6178520	6182840	there would be negativity and suspense, and if someone left and said the atmosphere was toxic,
6182840	6187640	people would just say, well we've been new, we've watched the episode. This was Jake Paul's attempt
6187640	6192360	to reclaim the drama that had taken so much from him, it was the chance to have a say on his own
6192360	6197400	character before other people did, and he was successful in that way, but it was still a very,
6197400	6198840	very mixed blessing.
6198840	6203640	You know that like, I'm business oriented, and I'm just getting straight to the fucking facts, like,
6203640	6207800	yeah we're friends, but like with that shit, it's just straight to the facts, like, that's disgusting,
6207800	6212920	like, you need to delete it, and here's why, and I don't want this drama, I don't have time for this
6212920	6219080	drama, like, I hate having to babysit, but it's part of what we need to do with this new Team 10,
6219080	6224760	because in the old one, there was no communication, and no, no one really actually managing what was
6224920	6225640	going on.
6225640	6231320	Jake's attempts to blend the personal and the business side on a public forum made sense in a way,
6231320	6235400	because it allowed people to see the often flawed process that individuals have as humans, and the
6235400	6240120	failings that occur along the way. How that perspective was at the expense of any actual interest
6240120	6244680	from most people outside the immediate audience, it played out more like something you'd see on a rather
6244680	6249320	tabloid cable channel rather than actual YouTube content. Viewership on each of these videos was a
6249320	6254120	few million, and although many of these viewers seemed interested, a lot just weren't even bothering
6254120	6258600	to click on them. Jake having full control of these aspects made the content unappealing, and
6258600	6263240	dampened the conflict, limiting the actual reach of videos. In fact, the only major drama that was
6263240	6267320	reported on by sources outside of Jake Paul in the first month of this airing was when a pair
6267320	6271320	of transgender women revealed they were kicked out of the house for their gender identity. You didn't
6271320	6275960	see that in the Team 10 uncut, did you? It played into this perception that this was still highly
6275960	6277240	processed content.
6278200	6282920	So do you want your room, or do you want to finish the conversation? Where do you want to go? Do you
6282920	6286440	want to end this on a good communicative term, or what?
6286440	6291960	It's over, Jake. I've got an argument with you. We're on Team 10 uncut. I don't give a fuck. I'm
6291960	6294920	hooked by sin, but we're letting you on the new land.
6294920	6299000	People didn't trust this sort of candid media from Jake, because people didn't trust him.
6299000	6302760	Additionally, it lacked the chemistry and dynamics that the original Team 10 possessed. There was
6302760	6306600	nothing wrong with these people, but at the same time, the reality style aspect really
6306600	6310840	sapped the personality from these individuals, many of whom could never recreate the energy of
6310840	6315240	a Martinez or a Chance, and I can't believe I'm even saying that. Almost as soon as Jake Paul
6315240	6320040	went back to posting normal content with Tana and a few others, his views jumped up significantly.
6320040	6324120	This led them to try merging these two together with a video clip baiting a couple's fight,
6324120	6328600	but even that couldn't inspire mass viewership. Episode 11 was released over a month and a half
6328600	6333560	later to a rather underwhelming response, and despite the promise of season 2, Team 10 uncut
6333560	6338360	was quietly ushered off the channel after 11 episodes, with normal content resuming soon
6338360	6342920	after. The last video uploaded to the Team 10 channel was on the 21st July 2019, which
6342920	6347400	appears to feature a reduced roster and an energy that was somewhat subdued. Maybe Jake knew that
6347400	6358680	finally, this time, it was the end of the line. Jake Paul had taken an extensive break to
6358680	6363000	recalibrate and rebuild Team 10 from the ground up. He had invested a lot of time and energy into
6363000	6368120	making this one of his most finely tuned ventures on his channel yet, but people weren't fighting.
6368120	6372600	I doubt many people even knew there was a second Team 10. Although Jake never officially brought
6372600	6376920	it to an end, stating in interviews that more would be coming soon, his plans for the crew
6376920	6381800	never really re-emerged, and although he kept some members around, Team 10 itself
6382360	6385640	was effectively over. Team 10 was dead.
6393080	6397480	There were continued hints and allusions by Jake Paul that Team 10 would eventually return,
6397480	6401320	but as I mentioned earlier, there has been no follow through on such, and any social media
6401320	6405560	presence they previously possessed has been mostly erased, including their channel which Jake has
6405560	6410920	now transformed into his Boxing Center podcast, BS with Jake Paul. Probably the most indicative
6410920	6415400	sign that Team 10 was a done deal was the fact that Jake Paul sold his house in 2021,
6415400	6419720	stating that he intended to move out of LA and focus on his mission to become the greatest
6419720	6424520	prize fighter in the world. In that sense, such an entourage may hold him back. It also didn't help
6424520	6429000	that in the years following its cessation, Team 10's legacy has been marred by continued claims
6429000	6433240	of extremely improper and unprofessional behaviour, coming from people who were formerly associated
6433240	6437640	with the group, and even people who weren't. These are not like claims, and in certain industries
6437720	6442440	would be taken very seriously, but Jake Paul is like a proverbial steamroller for his brand,
6442440	6447880	and his responses either amount to no response or threatening to sue. Jake doesn't care, I doubt he
6447880	6453000	ever will, but as far as Team 10 is concerned, he seems happier without them now, and I have a hunch
6453000	6457320	the feeling is mutual. Most former members appear to have found some success in the careers they've
6457320	6461480	decided to pursue, with a couple like the Dobres even staying in the clickbait game.
6461480	6465800	It's a testament to the sort of environment that we were living in 2017 that Team 10 existed,
6465800	6469400	and how they were treated by the public in general. It made sense there was this contempt
6469400	6473640	for them given their behaviour, but very few people really looked beyond that at the time.
6473640	6478520	I've heard people say that they missed the 2017 drama when it felt less serious, but the claims
6478520	6482600	weren't less serious, it's just the way people treated them were. The prevailing narrative was
6482600	6486600	that Team 10 is annoying, obnoxious, and therefore bad, and don't get me wrong, they're not good
6486600	6491080	things to be, but over time, the concerns relating to a group like that became greater and greater,
6491080	6495160	and their reputation, although not given much thought since, would likely sour in the public
6495240	6499160	mind or review. Is there anything vaguely positive at all that one can say about them?
6499160	6502760	Jake, it's every day bro, peace, peace bro, we're all dead.
6502760	6507240	There have been creator houses before, but none popularised the idea like Team 10,
6507240	6511160	and I don't believe it was just the luck of the draw, it was obviously highly calculated,
6511160	6515400	and at the core was a strong business mind who knew how to market himself and others in the form
6515400	6520280	of Jake Paul, an individual simultaneously able to be a successful public figure and a business one
6520280	6524360	required a lot of skills, and Jake Paul demonstrated that he could do either in creating
6524360	6528600	Team 10. The challenge came with actually balancing them, and trying to navigate interpersonal
6528600	6532440	relationships alongside them, which was a challenge given that Jake Paul seems like a bit
6532440	6537080	of a toxic person, an observation that became evident to many over time. We'll talk more about
6537080	6542360	him personally in a bit, but for the team itself to succeed, it needed a lot more than it had.
6542360	6546520	Hey, hey, this is my vlog channel, get the f*** out of the camera. Hey man, this is my vlog channel.
6546520	6551400	On the surface, Team 10's real success was lasting as long as they did, from the It's Every Day Bro
6551400	6555480	music video, and all the uploads, drum, and controversy that followed it. I have not been
6555480	6559160	able to go into detail about a lot of it because this video would have been so much longer than
6559160	6563560	planned, but the group was a ticking time bomb that could have resulted in much worse than it did.
6563560	6568040	Nick Crompton would dismiss prank content as fake to try and make it seem more inconsequential,
6568040	6571960	and to possibly counter those claims that these japes cause visible harm, but regardless of how
6571960	6576200	much of it was planned, there was tangibly a real element to it, and in trying to fulfil that sort
6576200	6580280	of YouTube insanity image, there were multiple times when the project could have just imploded
6580280	6585320	dramatically and given Jake the PR nightmare that he dreaded, so many close calls. Team 10
6585320	6589640	delicately walked the line of what was acceptable content to upload onto YouTube, and one can't help
6589640	6593560	but wonder if they would have crossed it if Jake's brother hadn't done so before. The off-camera
6593560	6597800	lifestyle of Team 10 was often reported in a rather unflattering light too, and yes, in a way
6597800	6601560	it can't be surprising that Jake Paul seemingly created a frat house environment, but a lot of
6601560	6606040	members didn't sign up to that, especially considering factors like background and age.
6606040	6610040	It was not something that everyone would have been happy to be a part of, but they didn't feel like
6610040	6614440	they had a say. Additionally, the general claims of individual maltreatment of those within the
6614440	6618760	house after they left were damning in their own right. It's obviously hard to evaluate the verity
6618760	6623240	of every last claim, but Jake seldom sought to deny a lot of them, he often dismissed or downplayed
6623240	6627800	them as misunderstandings and banter that had gone wrong, yet even if that was the case, it underlined
6627800	6631960	a fundamental problem of having something like Team 10 and what they offered, this idea that they
6631960	6636520	could take a smaller, inexperienced, often younger creator and grow their channel, but with one
6636600	6639960	massive condition, which is that you have to tolerate this group of people who are more
6639960	6643800	influential than you. You have to live in their house, and you have to deal with their antics.
6643800	6648120	Maybe nothing was designed with malice or intent to exploit, but Jake implicitly created an
6648120	6652600	environment that individuals would inherently feel rather trapped in. A brief read of a psychological
6652600	6656440	study on conformity and compliance would have told you that what they were creating could never
6656440	6660920	function healthily, but it kept happening. The greater problem with this environment is when
6660920	6665240	someone does decide to depart, it's always more dramatic. Leaving Team 10 videos didn't just
6665240	6669240	manifest as a trend because they were a fun thing to make, they existed because individuals
6669240	6673480	found their personal feelings caught up in this space that they felt trapped in, they'd crafted
6673480	6677560	a relationship with an audience who felt like they were a part of the team and that leaving would be
6677560	6681960	a betrayal of sorts, something that core members would occasionally refer to. These videos weren't
6681960	6686680	solely created as a way to attack Team 10, it was a way to rationalise their own decision to the
6686680	6691480	outside world. Every exit video felt like a stab to the Team 10 image, and yet every time they
6691480	6695000	persisted, while proclaiming that they knew exactly what they were doing. If they knew what
6695000	6698680	they were doing, then they'd know that they were trying to trap smaller creators in a collective
6698680	6702520	by offering them more influence and making it contingent on living in a house with a commitment
6702520	6707640	to millions of fans. But maybe Jake did know what he was doing, maybe he wanted to create a Team 10
6707640	6711720	that was fully submissive and under his thumb. Some people had noted his controlling nature,
6711720	6716760	he's a businessman and clearly has the ability to be methodical. He knew that if he had a consistent
6716760	6721320	roster that didn't feel like they could or should leave, then he should have a cash cow for at least
6721320	6725960	a few years, and yet in less than a year and a half it was practically over. A year and a half
6725960	6730920	was impressive innings given how catastrophic it could have been, but Jake always wanted Team 10
6730920	6735880	to be more, as shown by his presentation of it in interviews and messaging. He wanted to make as
6735880	6741480	much money from the concept as possible, and by failing to ensure their longevity, he fell short
6741480	6748280	of that goal. So, why does someone as supposedly successful as Jake Paul fail so miserably?
6751320	6761160	Jake Paul appeared to have a plan for Team 10. That plan was to bring a load of smaller craters
6761160	6765880	into one space and use Team 10 as a way to gradually grow their channels, and in return he would have a
6765880	6771240	share of their success. Some people go and want to go off on their own, but it doesn't necessarily
6771240	6776280	mean they're not a part of the Team 10 family. We've still got percentages though, lonesome, and
6776280	6780120	precision. Although this wasn't spoken about too much, there were general allusions to contracts
6780120	6783880	that would provide Jake Paul with a cut of a person's revenue, even if they left the YouTube
6783880	6788200	collective. However, I don't think the intention of that contract was just to let Jake Paul have a
6788200	6792840	share of income after someone left. Jake had more than enough money. Moreover, it was to encourage
6792840	6796680	people to stay and make money with him, because deep down Jake Paul knew that a continuously
6796680	6801000	changing roster of creators would not be good for brand identity, and he had to create something
6801000	6805880	that was successful enough to make a person stay, but not successful enough to make a person leave.
6805880	6810920	In essence, Team 10 was conceptualised as a honeypot for smaller creators. Jake Paul knew
6810920	6815800	that he had to make Team 10 an internet presence to guarantee his success, but he always seemed
6815800	6819640	cautious about how much power he was willing to grant them, from the simple decision of uploading
6819640	6824280	a significant portion of Team 10 content onto his own channel, calling the fans Jake Paulers,
6824280	6828040	to having an inner circle that oversaw a large majority of creative decisions. When people
6828040	6832280	raised certain concerns, he would supposedly reference PR, and how it would look if people left,
6832280	6835880	but it's also possible he didn't want people to live anywhere else than the house, because
6835880	6840280	that removal might give them some independence to make decisions about their future. He wanted fans
6840280	6845080	to be devoted to the holistic idea of Team 10 first, and any members other than himself second,
6845080	6850120	to maintain that threat of financial consequence if they did walk out, this idea that the fans
6850120	6854760	would not follow them out the door. The English Tudor story illustrated that although Jake may
6854760	6859400	have wanted to lift people up in a way, he wanted to keep them beneath him all the same, he wanted
6859400	6863160	to be their lifeline, if they walked away then they would be out of that spotlight he had provided
6863160	6867000	them with, and he was a well connected industry individual with roles on mainstream television.
6867000	6871320	During the first months, this plan appeared to work, and even when it was tested by a situation
6871320	6875480	such as Alyssa Violet's departure, it didn't seem to dent the brand too much because a majority of
6875480	6880520	fans were more interested in what Jake and Team 10 had to say about it than the situation itself.
6880520	6883400	This all changed, however, when they released It's Everyday Bro.
6883400	6897240	It's Everyday Bro was a stroke of marketing genius that I have no doubt was as intentionally
6897240	6901560	eye catching as many people found it, but at the same time, it was too eye catching for what
6901560	6906200	Jake Paul had intended, because it gave the members of Team 10 a never before known presence within
6906200	6910920	the online world. There was no real way to predict this level of virality, sure, songs in the past
6910920	6915160	would become popular for being particularly bad, but really I think Jake was just more interested
6915160	6919800	in making a simple track with immature lyrics that his target demographic would consume.
6919800	6924440	Before Jake, Paul was just known as this businessman influencer at the helm of Team 10 who
6924440	6929080	would draw attention for his occasional wild antics. You ask the average netizen before the 31st of
6929080	6933480	May about any of the members in Team 10 and you would receive a blank stare, but after there was
6933480	6937560	this sense that these individuals had possessed their own status, and even if that status were
6937560	6941800	treated negatively, it was still a power of sorts that could be wielded in a way that Jake Paul
6941800	6946920	didn't like, it was associated with the brand. The winds of change were indicated by a list of
6946920	6950920	violence video, even though she had left months prior, she clearly sensed that public opinion was
6950920	6955080	turning against Team 10, and felt like she had a space to release an impactful video on her
6955080	6959240	experience with Jake Paul. This was obviously exacerbated by the supposition that Jake was
6959240	6964520	referring to her in It's Everyday Bro, but even if he wasn't, she clearly felt empowered in that moment.
6964520	6969960	Something clicks in your head, like you want to kill someone, but you want to cry, and you want to
6971000	6974520	get revenge, but you can't. It's like so hard to explain.
6974520	6979080	Her video undermined this likely prevailing narrative from within Team 10, that if you walked away,
6979080	6983880	you'd lose everything that Jake had given you, that you'd be cut off from industry and a future within it.
6983880	6988600	As Team 10 became public enemy number one, Jake appeared to be losing his grasp on what he had
6988600	6993080	created. His behaviour became increasingly controversial and irrational, some might say they
6993240	6996680	were pushing the boundaries of content for entertainment and attention, but in doing this and
6996680	7000840	landing himself with a ton of negative publicity, he began to lose the credibility within the
7000840	7005000	industry that he held before, including his Disney show. It was hard to tell whether he thought that
7005000	7008920	this behaviour would cement his status amongst the remaining members, but really, it just made him
7008920	7013080	less and less powerful, to the point that even his supposedly serious moments were challenged
7013080	7017640	fervently from all those outside his echo chamber. When he tried to play his hand against Alyssa,
7017640	7021800	attempting to punish her for leaving, he showed that he really possessed very little.
7021800	7026920	Alright guys, so I'm in a Skype call right now with someone who is a part of Team 10, as well as
7026920	7032360	was there, present, a witness to everything that happened on the night that I allegedly assaulted
7032360	7036920	Megan Zelli, who is the assistant of Jake Paul. The tide was turning, and Jake no longer had the
7036920	7041400	credentials to back up this idea that he could be a decisive figure in a person's career, and over
7041400	7045640	time, members began to peel off gradually, some more quietly than others. There was far less at
7045640	7050120	stake for one's reputation to disassociate from Jake Paul and Team 10, arguably it became the
7050120	7054600	smarter thing to do to move on from the team that had become so ubiquitously maligned.
7054600	7058840	When your reputation is in the gutter like that, your power is reduced, and whether or not Jake
7058840	7062840	realised that, he didn't appear to adjust his behaviour with mind to it. However, one of the
7062840	7067160	more pivotal moments that appeared to influence Jake's power over many of those around him was
7067160	7071560	one that is often overlooked, the moving of the Team 10 house. In this case, the accommodation
7071560	7075560	was clearly a means to control those within the four walls of the Team 10 residence, however,
7075560	7079800	when they moved house, four people did not move with them, and none of those four people
7079800	7084040	returned. Firstly, Martinez Twins, who formally left in November, followed by Tristan Tessa,
7084040	7087640	who left in the new year, Tessa moving in with Tristan, who had never resided with the rest of
7087640	7092200	the crew anyway. It once again seemed to prove that once members were out of that sphere of power,
7092200	7096440	they would feel more comfortable walking away. The only people who appeared to stay longer for
7096440	7100200	a year at this point were those in his inner circle, this made sense as these people appeared
7100200	7104520	to have some control over the direction of the team. Nevertheless, they were also prominent
7104520	7109480	members in the group's image, and therefore had to be treated with extreme care. Yet, in a final
7109480	7114520	massive faux pas, Jake involved his father, who was either ignorant or dismissive to the role that
7114520	7119160	these people played, and his supposedly aggressive auditing style pushed critical members out of the
7119160	7123880	circle who had shared that control with Jake, leaving him with full control but a depleted
7123880	7129720	group, and a fate practically sealed. In barely a year, Jake had lost complete control, from the
7129720	7134040	businessman whose members relied on him to develop their skills and influence, to the laughing stock
7134040	7139240	of a frat boy who called their father in when the pressure got too much, and paid the price for it.
7139240	7144280	Although it was true that Team 10 couldn't exist without Jake Paul, it couldn't exist with Jake Paul
7144280	7147160	either, and maybe it's fate was sealed from the start.
7154600	7158680	In the February 2018 video that Jake Paul published covering Team 10's demise,
7158680	7163400	he reflects on how he struggled to get a read on members, and to really trust their intent,
7163400	7168200	and that makes sense to me, but I don't think it came down to the issue that he was unable to trust
7168200	7172600	these people, I think it came down to the fact that he was unable to understand people's needs
7172600	7176600	and actually look out for them. I don't have a doubt that if Jake Paul believed that he had an
7176600	7181320	option to keep members at Team 10 that didn't involve the tactics he executed, then he may well
7181320	7185720	have just done that, but it could well be an issue of being raised in an environment where the only
7185720	7191080	way to get what you want was through emotionally manipulative stratagems. He would regularly try
7191080	7195720	to keep people under the Team 10 roof, would become hostile if his plans were challenged,
7195720	7200120	would attempt to punish those who left, even if he claimed to be all about peace and love,
7200120	7205320	he had to show what would happen if they left to make sure they remained, but he lost that power
7205320	7210200	to keep people in his life. Jake set up Team 10 with the goal of making as much money as possible
7210200	7214440	essentially, but sometimes you have to invest in people to keep them around rather than just try
7214440	7218760	to keep them under your thumb, but for a person who wanted to create an incubator for future talent,
7218840	7222440	Jake didn't trust those people enough to support them in ways that they needed,
7222440	7227000	he was more comfortable holding them hostage in Team 10 purgatory which made them feel the need
7227000	7231880	to escape. To me, I think of the dichotomy between a rich servant and a poor master,
7231880	7236280	what Jake offered all of the members of Team 10 would inevitably make them a lot of money at some
7236280	7240920	point, even if they never derived any actual income from Jake Paul himself, but value isn't
7240920	7245240	singly derived from what's in your bank account, it's an intersection of a lot of aspects and
7245240	7250120	assets of one's life, and there's a point as well where someone will be happy with what they've made,
7250120	7254920	different people have different meanings of enough. For Jake Paul, I don't think anything
7254920	7258680	was ever enough for him, and so he struggled to empathise with people who actually did want
7258680	7263480	something simpler. Jake saw what he was giving as the ultimate sign of commitment and investment,
7263480	7267000	that he was growing these people's channels and providing them with a route to stardom,
7267000	7271480	and in return they just had to relinquish some form of control over their lives, which he was
7271480	7275560	more than ready to make the most of. He always seemed to think that anything he gave to people
7275560	7279880	should be returned in a transactional sense with emotional loyalty, but the moment you do a favour
7279880	7284920	with the expectation of something in return, well it's no longer a favour. Those people didn't use
7284920	7287920	you, you tried to use them and failed.
7288000	7292000	If Adam is a talent manager and he's going to be helping you get deals, he's going to be helping you
7292000	7300000	protect your brand, I didn't even know he was your talent manager, I thought he was in team 10 with us,
7300000	7306960	so that's another issue of this communication, that I thought he's a homie that's in team 10 with us,
7306960	7310000	that's dating Lauren, a part of team 10 as well.
7310000	7314400	There's this episode of Team 10 Uncut where Jake Paul has this rather awkward exchange with a member
7314400	7319120	regarding a situation, and many observed in the comments how he seemed to be incapable of balancing
7319120	7323440	his personal capacities with his professional capacities. This was always one of the key problems,
7323440	7327280	because whenever he did something that may have negatively affected someone or upset them,
7327280	7330960	it was business to him, but whenever someone did something in return that bothered him,
7330960	7335120	it was personal. It was the case when people left and he said it was business, but clearly felt like
7335120	7338960	he was used because they didn't reciprocate his investment, and it was the case with a list of
7338960	7342640	sleeping with Logan after Jake had seemingly slept with multiple women during an emotionally
7342640	7348160	dysfunctional and abusive relationship. He was so robust, and yet so fragile, so methodic,
7348160	7353920	and yet so unnecessarily vindictive. It's strange to think how different this timeline may be if
7353920	7358560	Jake didn't think to scatter the verses of his breakout hit with excessive references to the
7358560	7363200	person he had evicted a few months before. Alyssa may never have made that video.
7363200	7369680	Alyssa- I decided to be savage like him, and it ended with me being homeless.
7369680	7374080	In the end, it just led to very unhealthy dynamics between himself and other members,
7374080	7378640	who had a lot less influence than him. It made the Team 10 house a very exhausting atmosphere
7378640	7382400	for some, and create a relationship with Jake Paul where people never really knew where they
7382400	7387120	stood. It wasn't just a case of Jake Paul being unable to trust other people, it was a case of
7387120	7391280	other people being unable to trust Jake Paul, and when you have a large group with a defined
7391280	7395280	ringleader, then you need to be able to put your faith in that person. To me, Jake Paul's claims
7395280	7399040	that everything was fake was a way to cope with the fact that he didn't know where to set the
7399040	7402880	boundaries of reality in his interpersonal relationships with his colleagues and friends.
7402880	7407280	His commitment to maximising Team 10's profits while trying to use his personal self created
7407280	7411680	a conflict where his supposed friends didn't know who he was. This was demonstrated when he tried
7411680	7416640	to revive Team 10 with a show that operates in a genre where a lot of content is often fabricated,
7416640	7421200	seemingly under the expectation that that's what people wanted to see. They wanted the drama, sure,
7421200	7425120	they wanted the fight, sure, Jake wanted to give them that, but without any of the actual stakes
7425120	7429680	outside of the channel. Unfortunately for Jake, that aspect of realism was what made the original
7429680	7434080	Team 10 so interesting and fascinating for viewers. What makes YouTube successful in that way
7434080	7438560	is that people do feel involved and closer to these creators, the drama, responses, uploads,
7438560	7442640	commentary. It made people feel close to the action and gave them this affinity to those
7442640	7446720	involved, whether they were on Jake's side or not. It is ironic that even after being shunned by much
7446720	7451120	of the mainstream industry, Jake still wanted to give people a Disney Channel version of Team 10
7451120	7455760	drama. Jake's desire for complete control of a narrative ultimately compromised the reason why
7455760	7460400	Team 10 was so successful in the first place though, this was only Team 10 by name, very few
7460400	7465040	people will ever think of that name and think of these people. No offence to them, but maybe it's
7465040	7469440	not a name you want to be associated with anyway. Jake Paul will always be the first name that comes
7469440	7474720	to people's minds, and that's what Jake Paul wanted. He was the founder, he was the innovator,
7474720	7480160	he was the communicator, and so much more, but he was never everything. Even if Jake Paul was
7480160	7485280	the centrepiece of Team 10, even if he was the secret sauce, as he called it. The reason that a
7485280	7489680	secret sauce can remain secret is the presence of other ingredients, and when something comes
7489680	7493840	together, and when something works, you make sure you keep those ingredients there. Most people
7493840	7498240	don't leave squads because they don't like drama, they're musicians that remained together for decades
7498240	7502720	despite hating each other. If there was something worth staying for, then many of those who left
7502720	7507440	would, but Jake's ego was too big to give people a reason to stay, continuously claiming that it was
7507440	7512720	all under control while watching the ship sink, involving people incapable of resolving the glaring
7512720	7517040	flaws and maintaining a personal environment where others wanted to be, discarding the mantra
7517040	7523760	that he started the team under, for the talent, by the talent. What sort of talent is your father?
7523760	7539040	Crowd Cheers
7539040	7543920	The success of Team 10 was a recipe that captured the imagination of youngsters all over the world,
7543920	7548640	alongside the ire of many creators and commentators who wondered what their appeal even was.
7548640	7553200	Well, it appealed to the most primitive idea of success, the freedom to just live as recklessly
7553200	7557440	as you wish every day and hit a reset button before the next one starts. Do whatever the hell
7557440	7561760	you want, however you want. With the power of producing and editing, they successfully crafted
7561760	7566400	that image for millions of people. However, there are a fair few reasons why we don't live like that
7566400	7571280	most of the time, and as Team 10 became more notorious and unstable, those reasons became clear.
7571280	7575440	You can't hit a reset button at the end of the day, the reckless behaviour will stick with people
7575440	7579680	to the point where they won't want to be a part of that life anymore. It's not something they'll
7579680	7584320	want to do, they came to that house with massive dreams, but all they received was an early wakeup
7584320	7589360	call. Most people can't and won't live like that, and I don't think Jake ever properly comprehended
7589360	7593520	that. Maybe he just didn't want to, and would have rather continued to live in his fantasy of
7593520	7597840	excess, but his failure to address the fact that sometimes people just want a bit of their life to
7597840	7602320	themselves was what cost him their company, it served as a reminder that there are some things
7602320	7608160	you can never fully control. For all the highs and lows, Team 10 lived like it died, at the hands of
7608160	7613600	a man who's ego was too great for one, but not enough for ten. Whether it could have amounted to
7613600	7618400	something greater is a question that will never likely be answered, but perhaps that's for the best.
7619200	7624960	It's over now, and to be honest I can't ever see it coming back, but for a few months in 2017,
7625760	7630960	for better and for worse, it really was every day. Bro.
7638960	7657680	So yeah, that was the video, I hope you enjoyed it, it was certainly an experience for me. I'd like to
7657680	7663280	give a big thanks to the editors as always, they've done a great job, and I appreciate all their work,
7663280	7667520	and there are some really really good edits in this one, so I hope you appreciated that too. I'd
7667520	7673360	like to give a big thanks to the post editor, Kojak, person on audio, who I assume will be
7673360	7679760	Linuski, but we can change this bit if it's not. Thumbnail artist, Staffo, fantastic work as always,
7679760	7684720	big shout out to my patrons, $10 plus patrons on the screen now, but also have to give a special
7684720	7690720	shout out to the $50 patrons, Seri Tisch, Esther Bedoya, and Hypercube, thank you as always for

7706160	7710960	a pleasure working with you as always, and I look forward to doing it again very soon. And just a
7710960	7716560	reminder that it is code opinion you need, code opinion for 3 months free. I don't really know
7716560	7721680	if I have too much else to add, but I hope you guys are taking care of yourselves and looking
7721680	7726960	after yourself as it finally begins to cool down up here for the winter. So I hope you guys have
7726960	7733680	a good day, good week, good month, but until then, I'm The Right Opinion, and I will see you in the next one. Thank you.
7751680	7759920	Bye.
