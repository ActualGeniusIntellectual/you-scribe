0	5000	Hello, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time.
5000	18000	Now, a lot of people ask me, yo, why are you doing this? You don't need to. You have a decent life and a decent future, and they're not wrong.
18000	26000	I have a perfectly good life with great family and great friends, but I can always do better, and I want to do better.
26000	30000	I want the cars, I want the girls, but most of all, I want the power.
30000	39000	I jest, I jest. To the people wondering about what content you'll find here, I'm a man of many interests, but I will be starting on current affairs and what's going on in the news.
39000	49000	I'm happy to take requests if a topic is workable enough, and eventually, if I become popular, then you may expect to see more side series talking about other topics such as music and film.
49000	58000	Starting from next week, I will be attempting to upload every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, hopefully with little series, maybe set out on specific days.
58000	70000	This isn't just about me, this is also about you, the public, and I feel we often rely too much on modern media to try and shape our opinions when nearly all sources these days are completely fucking biased.
70000	76000	And what I'm going to do is hopefully present more weighted arguments with a dash of humour for the greater good.
76000	78000	The greater good.
78000	88000	Now, no doubt there'll be times when you think, this guy is chatting a load of shit, and to be honest, I probably will chat some shit in my time, but it's a learning experience.
88000	95000	I can't always be right, but I will attempt to refine my opinions over time when I've gained that information.
95000	101000	Undoubtedly, if I do blurt for some unfathomable reason, this will be the channel where you find massive comment wars.
101000	108000	But in a way, that's what I want. Debate is perfectly healthy, as long as it's done with respect for others' opinions.
108000	113000	Which will definitely not happen on the internet, but I live in hope.
113000	120000	I have no problem with people disagreeing with my opinion, in fact I want to bring as much variation in belief as possible to my videos.
120000	124000	So if you do feel like you have something important you'd like to say, say it.
124000	131000	I must thank a lot of YouTubers for inspiring me to start my own channel, I'm not denying you will be able to draw parallels between my style and others,
131000	136000	but I'll also be relying on my own personality to try and bring this channel some individuality.
136000	139000	Emphasis on the trying part.
139000	148000	So, if you like what you hear, take my personal unbiased advice and press that subscribe button, and if you don't then you've probably already clicked back to Pornhub.
148000	150000	Dickhead.
154000	161000	.
