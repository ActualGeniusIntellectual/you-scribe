0	11360	Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time,
11360	16400	and YouTube drama comes in many different forms. In the last few months, a lot of my videos have focused on these
16400	22320	situations that have spanned over years, and although a drama may reach its peak in a way that catches people off guard,
22320	28400	if you look at the history, normally you'll see a pattern of conflict and attention from other commentators that has contributed to
28480	34160	a climax of sorts. However, drama can often be even more shocking when it happens out of nowhere, when people think that
34160	40400	actually a certain channel may be the last place to end up spiralling so dramatically, and that's what appeared to be the case
40400	43760	with today's subject, the channel named Danplan.
43760	59600	Now, when a lot of people reached out to me about this situation, I will admit, I was not familiar with Danplan,
59600	65360	and in spite of their approximately 2 million strong fanbase, many of my friends were not familiar with their content either,
65360	70800	so I sat down and watched a lot of Danplan, and tried to immerse myself in their content.
70800	77200	Now I think I have a decent grasp, I will briefly summarise their origins and style, so people have a grip on how they
77200	83920	created such a significant following. Danplan as a channel was established in July 2014 by their titular creators,
83920	91760	Daniel and his friend Hosuh, with the first upload coming soon after, delightfully named, by the way, Moral of the Pooping Robber.
91760	98160	And I know, I know, I know what you're thinking, you're thinking, why is Joe fighting a dude with a weapon?
98160	104640	Wait, wait, wait, I can do better, I can do better. Why is Joe fighting a dude with a weapon?
104640	111120	But you have to realise that Joe is extremely strong, even today when he slaps me in the back to say hi in a friendly manner,
111120	113840	it feels like this.
116240	121280	This was the first instalment of their By The Way series, and this video consisted of a rather crudely drawn
121280	127120	character discussing a story told by his youth pastor, in which this pastor encountered a series of burglaries
127120	133120	conducted by a robber who defecated following each incident. Now the audio could be a tad better, and this video
133120	138160	only appears to include Dan's commentary, but you can definitely see the origins of a great channel in the making,
138160	143840	a lot of Hosuh's creative illustrations enhance Dan's stories on a comedic basis, and Dan's outgoing nature
143840	147760	makes him an effective storyteller, there was definitely potential here.
147840	153920	However, this series wouldn't receive much attention following its initial upload, animation was in a bit of a lull at that point,
153920	159360	Daniel and Hosuh were busy people, and thus it was probably not worth putting too many eggs in that basket.
159360	165440	After this, Dan Plan spent just under a couple years dedicated to gaming content, which was much more popular at the time.
165440	169760	These gaming videos weren't the most unique, though they were often presented more like highlight reels,
169760	174480	and used character heads to represent different people talking, and to try and give it a unique energy.
174480	181440	Dan was the consistent host of these videos, gaming with a varying roster of guests such as Anna, Billie, Jay, and of course, Hosuh.
181440	186400	However, there was one more character to introduce to the story, that person goes by the name of Steven.
186400	215360	Steven was introduced on the 5th of September 2015, in the upload Yamate, Titan Senpai,
215360	219600	in which he and of course Dan and Hosuh play the Attack on Titan tribute game.
219600	223440	Like Hosuh and many of their other friends, they were acquainted through school and college,
223440	228960	and for these comrades, this was just a regular gaming session which happened to be uploaded onto YouTube.
228960	235680	Steven was not one of the original members, but he quickly became a recurring guest on the channel as other individuals began to appear less.
235680	243520	However, these gaming videos, although enjoyable for those who participated, didn't set the channel on fire, gaining Dan Plan only 50 subscribers.
243520	249600	So come May 2016, the By the Way series was resumed, but this time with a slightly different format.
249600	252480	Daniel- Alright, let me tell you a story about the time when my final exams ended.
252480	255200	Steven- Wait, wait, wait. Daniel- So, why are you telling you a story?
255200	260000	In this video, Daniel tries to tell a story, but is occasionally interrupted by his friends.
260000	265680	Initially requesting justification for the change in direction, and then reacting to his outlandish story regarding the time,
265680	268880	he discovered a variety of condoms under a person's bed.
268880	274720	It was a rough idea of what he had planned for these videos, and over the next few uploads he would continue to refine this brand.
274720	279680	In his By the Way Would You Rather, he incorporates his friends, providing them with a more prominent role.
279680	284480	In this instance, the friends were Hosuh and Jay, another person who regularly appeared on the channel.
284480	291840	By the next video, however, the person appearing alongside Dan and Hosuh was Steven, and he became the principal third contributor to this content.
291840	296960	Now, as any creator knows, these videos will not take off immediately, at least most videos won't.
296960	301440	However, within the year they had their first hit, By the Way, Are You A Psychopath?
301440	307920	Now, it's quite easy to work out why this video did well, it's a punchy title, it's a popular topic, and it's a striking thumbnail,
307920	310480	and they probably had some pretty impressive watch time too.
310480	315920	At this point, animation videos had begun to pick up significant traction, so there was really no better time to blow up,
315920	318960	and over the months and years following, they would do just that.
318960	340080	Like their psychopath video, a lot of their content integrated anecdotal style games,
340080	344000	which would often present a challenge and ask the participants to make a decision,
344000	347120	which would then lead to various consequences and banter alike.
347120	354640	It's engaging to watch and often quite interactive, I would find myself pausing the videos to see if I could work out these questions or mysteries myself,
354640	357520	and as their channel grew, their chemistry seemed to develop as well.
374000	386560	And thus they established their brand, Daniel, Hosuh, and Steven.
386560	389840	By the way, but more importantly, DanPlan.
389840	394080	Their content had mass appeal, the topics were timeless, with great rewatch value,
394080	399600	and there was a legitimate chemistry that was rooted in a transcendent bond thanks to organic friendships
399600	402880	that one cannot simply cultivate for mere business purposes.
402880	407600	What could possibly go wrong? Well, a lot.
407600	410800	Hey guys. Sorry, but there won't be a stream this week.
411600	416960	But I did want to give you guys an explanation about me and DanPlan and just the future of this channel.
417600	420960	So as the title of the video says, I've quit DanPlan.
423520	429440	Join me today as we analyze DanPlan, what exactly went down, what exactly people said, what exactly went wrong,
429440	431760	and if there's any way to write it.
431760	437440	And maybe if I'm feeling a bit charitable, I'll garnish this spicy dish with a few right opinions here and there.
437440	440800	I want to also clarify that due to the chronological order of this drama,
440800	443040	I'll be going over one side before the other.
443040	447360	So if it looks unfavourable towards an individual, sit tight, we'll get there.
447360	450000	Without further ado, I suggest we dive right in.
450000	461440	As said, the three people central to the DanPlan channel were Daniel, Hosuh, and Steven.
461440	465440	Over the years, they established a reputation that was essential to the brand they were creating,
465440	467760	as a collective, and as individuals.
467760	474640	By the way, it became a primary brand, and it often became interchangeable with the DanPlan channel for many audience members.
474640	477440	Within DanPlan, these characters had their appeal.
477440	482720	Dan as the strong anchor for the content and direction of discussion, Hosuh as the precious spirit of innocence,
482720	485920	and Steven as the slightly darker, more twisted Geezer.
485920	488000	Geezer- Can I just leave the country?
488000	490480	Steven- No leaving the country, that's too easy.
490480	491360	Geezer- Too easy.
491360	494880	Hosuh- I think I'd go to school.
494880	496800	Steven- Well, I mean, I can f*** up schools too.
496800	499600	Geezer- It's not just in America, not just in America!
499600	503120	Geezer- I can say that in public, so I won't take that out.
503120	506240	Steven- It's the purge, okay? It's on the purge.
506240	509360	With this in mind, even though the channel was owned by Dan and Hosuh,
509360	512000	it gave many viewers the impression it was a mutual venture.
512000	515440	There were a couple videos which deviated from the By The Way style,
515440	517840	and those were probably more restricted to Dan and Hosuh,
517840	521760	but as many people tended to conflate the By The Way series with the DanPlan channel,
521760	525920	it would be easy to receive the impression that they all had a somewhat similar stake.
525920	529840	2019 was an incredibly successful year for the DanPlan squad.
529840	532880	They hit 1 million subscribers, they hit 2 million subscribers,
532880	535440	they released a ton of merch, launched a Discord server,
535440	539440	there was a lot to celebrate, but come 2020, it would all change.
540080	545360	On January the 4th, DanPlan released a video called By The Way, Can You Become a Superhero?
545360	547440	The video is fairly routine.
547440	550640	Dan- Steven, you've seen to the future, a person's about to get hit by the bus.
550640	553200	Three, f*** the tires of the bus.
553200	557200	Geezer- The tires of the bus hits, the bus rolls, f*** 20 people inside.
557200	558960	Geezer- Oh my god, man!
558960	564240	Dan- Save the elderly, that was my objective, saving the elderly, that's all that matters.
564240	568160	Unsuspecting Dan fans, hehe, didn't notice much.
568160	573040	However, the video was ominously labelled Final Episode, and judging by the shock of many people
573040	577040	in light of what happened next, gives me the impression that people assumed the subtitle
577040	581520	didn't mean the end of DanPlan's series, but more the end of the two parts which they had titled
581520	582720	in such a way before.
582720	588080	However, less than 5 hours later, Steven, a third of By The Way, formally announced in a video
588080	590720	that he was going to be departing DanPlan.
590800	595840	Now, that's obviously shocking for many reasons, but people leave shows, people leave groups,
595840	598320	people move on, that's what you expect.
598320	602880	What people didn't expect was the explanation, normally you have some quaintly written letter
602880	606720	thanking people for the good times and memories, and I'm not doubting that Steven didn't have
606720	611840	some of his own, but they were not the focus of this video, he had a greater issue to discuss.
612400	618720	This isn't gonna be a Daniel exposed video, but I did want you all to know about how this all started.
618800	620080	Daniel himself.
620080	621760	Let's break the video down.
621760	626400	Announcing that he had formally left in mid-December, Steven takes us back to the start, and breaks
626400	627760	down his role on the channel.
627760	631680	I have already explained a fair bit of this, but Steven emphasises that he was not part
631680	636480	of the channel at first, and he only became involved when Hosuh proposed a third member,
636480	641280	which became particularly integral when DanPlan transitioned from gaming to more character-driven
641280	642800	animation videos.
642800	648560	Our unique theme and on-camera personalities meshed so well, and that's probably why we
648560	650880	got so popular so fast.
650880	656080	The three of us and our dynamic was just remarkable, and the way we float off of each other is still
656080	658000	something that amazes me looking back.
658000	662480	Then he talks about their success, and how their dynamic concept and delivery all contributed
662480	662960	to it.
662960	666080	He talks about the scale of the success and his own reaction.
666080	670000	Nonetheless, he has never considered it more than a hobby, him establishing a role in the
670000	674800	success and how he has perceived it sets up his next point, which would be the treatment
674800	676800	and credit that he has received.
676800	680640	It's no secret that I've never thought of YouTube as anything other than a hobby.
681200	686640	Even now with Actually Steven, I still don't consider it a job, but Daniel did, which brings
686640	690080	me to this year, and why friends and business don't mix.
690080	694480	This is where the first issue comes in, as a main voice on the channel, and someone who
694480	698960	was involved in the presentation, he felt proportionally he deserved more than he was
698960	700240	receiving from Danplan.
700240	704560	He accepts that he's not quite as involved, but in the month where he states the Chow
704560	709520	was making five figures, he had only received a total of $225.
709520	714960	We can assume this occurred around early 2019, as he stated the upcoming instant due to this
714960	717760	happened around nine months prior to him quitting in December.
717760	721440	Now, to receive such a meager wage in return felt insulting to him.
721440	725760	However, for many, a problem like this between friends wouldn't be publicised unless he had
725760	728160	attempted to find a compromise himself.
728160	732240	Unfortunately, this attempted resolution led to a very angry two-day dispute between
732240	736560	Daniel and Steven, in which Steven requested a 20% share of the channel.
736560	741200	Daniel not only rejected this proposal, but the dispute resulted in what many view as
741200	743200	Daniel's most objectionable statements.
744000	748320	So me and Daniel argued for hours over the course of two days.
749440	754320	But then I asked Daniel, what could I do to increase my share in Danplan?
755040	756720	And everything just imploded.
757440	760800	He said nothing, you're just an employee, you have no share.
761520	765520	And that statement has stuck with me ever since we fought, and it hasn't gone away.
766080	770560	At this point, Steven proceeds to directly respond to the statement, once again re-emphasising
770560	774480	his contribution, and then contrasting it with Daniel's statement, to highlight its
774480	775680	disrespectful nature.
775680	780080	He then proceeds to say at that point he planned on quitting, but wanted to stay due to multiple
780080	783840	reasons, including Hosuh's attempt to resolve the strained relationships, the fact that
783840	788080	Steven enjoyed the fame and attention, but primarily because he wanted to prove himself
788080	791440	worthy of having more of a share, more of a position on the channel.
791440	795360	However, the more he vied for that approval, the more he came to the realisation that it
795360	796880	was ultimately unattainable.
796880	800000	And so, for the past nine months, I tried.
800000	802240	God knows I tried.
802240	806480	Every recording session, I brought my humour, my edge to the table.
808000	809280	But I fought a losing battle.
809280	817200	The more effort I put into developing my character, developing Steven, I realised how
817200	818640	little Daniel valued it.
819600	825200	Formal Mafia Steven, Huggy Zombie Apocalypse Steven, Mmm Hosuh Steven.
825200	829840	Daniel didn't give me a script to do those characters, I made them up, and I made my
829840	831680	personalities enjoyable.
831680	836000	But to Daniel, every recording session, I was merely talking to friends.
836000	839120	To him, I wasn't putting in any effort into the videos.
839680	844720	Every recording session, I wanted to swear at Daniel for real, to yell at him so much
844720	848800	that I had to stop talking sometimes or else I might say something I would regret the next
848800	849040	day.
851040	856080	And that feeling only grew each session until the last recording in November that we did,
857120	860560	where I finally just zoned out and stopped trying at all.
861280	866800	Nine months ago, when we argued, I asked Dan how many views on our videos were garnered
866800	867200	by me.
867840	869360	He said he didn't have an answer.
870400	875760	A few weeks ago, I asked him the same question again, and his answer didn't change.
877360	883760	So I know that no matter how hard I try, no matter how many personalities I perfect,
883760	886480	Daniel will never consider me an equal on the channel.
887040	888160	So I quit.
888160	892080	Stephen ends with some rather somber messages, stating that people should know their own
892080	896080	worth on the channel because Daniel won't recognise it otherwise, and that ultimately
896080	900480	he regrets being a part of DanPlan, because he still believes he'd call Dan a friend if
900480	903280	he'd not involved himself with the channel in the first place.
903280	903680	Sad.
904240	908080	There are a lot of messages to break down within this video, but we can't say too much
908080	912560	currently, as there are still many more perspectives to analyse, and conflicting points of view.
912560	916640	What I will say is that in light of this video, a majority of people believed him, but they
916640	919040	weren't necessarily hostile towards Daniel.
919040	922800	They more passed on the message that as it stood, they were upset with him, but would
922800	924560	like to hear his side nonetheless.
924560	928320	However, before that could happen, there were a few more hammers to fall, and we'll get
928320	929360	into that right now.
935440	939840	Approximately a week after his video, Stephen conducted a two-hour stream, which obviously
939840	943040	made me very happy, as it was more material for me to sit through.
943040	944000	Thank you, Stephen.
944000	947520	But jokes aside, there are some key details here, even if you have to sift through a lot
947520	952160	of the casual discussion, though I am going to be reserving some details for later discourse.
952160	956560	Now, at this point, Daniel had not responded yet, and had not replied to any of Stephen's
956560	960800	messages seeking resolution, leading to a significant amount of frustration.
960800	964880	Stephen felt uncertain as to Dan's state, so had decided to proceed with this live stream
964880	968160	where he talks more about the conditions surrounding the situation.
968160	973040	Let me preface this entire stream by saying, I have reached out to Daniel.
974080	980800	I talked- I tried to talk to him yesterday, just so I can give him some time between getting
980800	987600	like all this drama dropped on him, and then like him actually wanting to talk to me.
988560	993680	So I tried to give him like at least some time, and in that time, I was hoping that
993680	1000160	he would post something, or at least try to dispel the things I said in my video.
1000880	1007360	But it's just been total silence from him, and I'm not sure what else to do at this point.
1008160	1013120	So I'll just give my side of the story, and if it somehow overlaps with his,
1014560	1019280	feel free to, I guess, disprove them, Daniel.
1019840	1023680	There's a lot to digest here, and I would obviously recommend watching it yourself,
1023680	1027920	if you're truly interested in what he said. A lot of it is relating to feelings that he's had
1027920	1032320	following the video, how he's coping, what he's planning to do when Dan responds, and so on,
1032320	1036000	and a few more personal questions, such as whether he believed YouTube changed Dan,
1036000	1040960	of which you can probably guess Stephen's answer. However, there are a few interesting points here,
1040960	1045680	the first one was regarding pay. According to Stephen, poster as co-owner was originally being
1045680	1050880	paid on a 50-50 split with Dan, however, at some point in 2017, the split was altered,
1050880	1055520	so that Dan received 85% to Hosuh's 15. Quite the change.
1076240	1083440	and then just paid out whoever with the 100%, which is insane to me. Hosuh probably has reasons
1083440	1088640	for it, but it was just insane that I heard that. And then I asked him, hey Hosuh, how much
1088640	1098400	have you been paid? And he said, 28,000. Okay, so let's assume that 28,000 is 15% of the total
1098400	1104720	revenue, not even just like gross, like the total amount, it's just the amount that Daniel has made.
1104720	1112080	So let's say, okay, so 28,000, 15%, do some like multiplication and division,
1113120	1121600	you end up with about $40,000 made in revenue, which is exactly the same as the Social Blade
1121600	1128800	midpoint. The more I dove into it, the more I realized how many more people were being screwed.
1128800	1132320	This is not just a me problem anymore. When I started digging,
1132320	1137200	I started asking the animators, how much were you getting paid? And the answers kept being the same,
1137200	1144640	about $450 per month. For a month of work, they get $450, and it's not even consistent,
1145200	1150000	because sometimes it takes more than a month to make a video, but you still get $450.
1150000	1154160	Now, Stephen states in the description that this comment was actually incorrect, and although he
1154160	1159280	got the details right, he got the maths wrong. Hosuh actually made 42,000 Canadian dollars,
1159280	1165360	which means by estimates of the share, Dan would have comparatively made 280,000. He also calls out
1165360	1171200	Dan for paying the animators who work for him $450 a month while on quote full time hours,
1171200	1175520	in spite of the observed money he was making. Stephen uses Social Blade to back up his
1175520	1178320	statements here, we'll hold these thoughts until later.
1178320	1183840	Stephen- Daniel has essentially trapped any animator who actually wants to make a living,
1183840	1188720	just by paying them like slave wages, while still making them work full time.
1188720	1193280	One more point relates to the individual by the name of Jay. Now, Jay had appeared on Dan
1193280	1197600	Plan's channel multiple times, often alongside Stephen. In this video, there is an air of
1197600	1202080	uncertainty about Jay's role, however, one thing that many have observed were the similarities
1202080	1206640	between Jay's and Stephen's personalities, leading many to theorise that Dan was planning
1206640	1211680	on replacing Stephen with Jay altogether. Stephen says he feels that after the confrontation in
1211680	1216880	early 2019, Dan was looking to do just that, as his mannerisms were very popular. However,
1216880	1221520	Stephen didn't feel that Jay was a specific replacement, as he believed that no one could
1221520	1226720	truly emulate his style. Stephen also discloses that Jay was being paid nothing whatsoever,
1226720	1231040	which was surprising for many considering the numerous appearances he had made on the channel
1231040	1237600	as well, although he was just a guest. Stephen- I knew for a fact that Daniel was trying to
1237600	1244640	replace me after the fight that we had back in March, after the March incident.
1247280	1253040	And I think because of that, it made me see like people around me as my replacements.
1255680	1262400	Do I think Jay was a replacement? No. No one can emulate this greatness.
1262400	1265840	So yeah, I don't think Jay was a replacement for anyone.
1265840	1270080	However, the specifics were still shrouded in mystery. One thing that seemed prevalent in this
1270080	1274720	case was the lack of evidence. A lot of what we'd heard up to this point was either party
1274720	1279120	testimonies, or third party comments relayed through Stephen. This was also probably given
1279120	1284080	that a lot of the anecdotes were based on verbal interactions, and obviously one doesn't typically
1284080	1288880	think to record calls, it's not really considered kosher, so many people were eagerly awaiting
1288880	1295600	Dan's response, and it was coming. But then to the stage left an unexpected guest, Jay himself.
1295600	1300240	Now, Jay had been commenting on the situation from the sidelines, however, on the 17th of January,
1300240	1305600	days before Dan would release his own response, Jay makes his video titled Why I say I'm not a part
1305600	1310560	of DanPlan. Now, I'll add the disclaimer that this video is currently private, and we'll discuss that
1310560	1315040	towards the end, but before we indulge in those details, we should probably investigate what the
1315040	1320560	video exactly says. To summarise, it basically does what it says on the tin, with a bit more to
1320560	1324960	boot. He opens it up with the acknowledgement that he's not as invested in it as other parties,
1324960	1328800	but felt an inclination to contribute due to his position. He talks background about his
1328800	1332880	relationship with Dan, why he was restricted in his commitment, stating that everything
1332880	1338160	seemed fine until July 2019, a few months after Dan's confrontation with Stephen.
1338160	1347040	So it's around this time, I guess, so July 2019, that I started to get a hunch or a feeling.
1347680	1351600	I had a hunch that something was off with DanPlan channel internally.
1352960	1359600	So I decided to do a small investigation privately, and when Dan found out about it
1359600	1366320	that I was digging, he adamantly tried to make me drop it. He did not want me to dig around.
1367280	1371360	And that is when I learned several extremely dangerous issues.
1371360	1377200	In July 2019, Jay states that he began investigating some of the apparent internal issues of the channel,
1377200	1381920	but when Daniel found out, he became quite agitated, and determined to steer attention away from these
1381920	1387040	problems. However, according to Jay, this just led to more problems surfacing. Firstly, that of pay.
1387040	1391840	Jay attests that when initially splitting the channel revenue, Dan split the revenue 50-50 with
1391840	1396400	Hosuh in a purposeful attempt to block out Stephen. He states that when asking about this, Dan decided
1396400	1400880	to deflect this decision onto various reasoning which did not appear particularly watertight.
1401840	1409520	Dan later reasoned that the reason Stephen was left out was that Stephen was very uncaring about
1409520	1414160	the YouTube project. The example Dan gave to me was that Stephen would be on his phone during
1414160	1420160	the recording. I actually confirmed that was Stephen, that it only happened twice, and both
1420160	1426320	occurred during a very long recording session, lasting 4 hours. One with the Hunger Game, and one
1426320	1433920	with the Mafia. Stephen would also not do much in terms of the channel with editing, etc. But
1435760	1441920	I'm pretty sure a lot of you Dan plan followers might know, Stephen had an incredibly massive
1441920	1448160	influence at this point. He had a massive audience. He also clears up the changing of the
1448160	1452320	share, stating Hosuh didn't want any money and wanted it invested back in the channel,
1452320	1457520	yet Daniel continued to pass on a share to Hosuh regardless. Hosuh specifically told Dan that
1458400	1465840	Hosuh did not want the channel money. Hosuh wanted Dan to use the money to grow the channel,
1466640	1474480	but Dan later essentially pushed the money onto Hosuh for at least 15%, so the Dan plan revenue
1474480	1481120	was split 85 to Dan, 15 to Hosuh. That's just a side note. So Stephen, and of course Stephen,
1481120	1485440	zero. He goes on to talk about the incident where Stephen finds out about the money that Dan's
1485440	1491200	making from the channel, and goes on to demand 20%. He also says this, which is curious.
1491200	1499920	Stephen approached Dan about it later, about the monetary issue, and Stephen requested 20%
1500000	1510480	of the channel share. Dan might say that it's 33%, that is not true. Stephen himself
1510480	1516160	requested 20%. Something to keep in mind. So during these negotiations, Jay states that
1516160	1521280	Daniel rejected Stephen's proposals wholly, obviously referencing the employee quotes.
1521280	1526400	Currently Jay isn't saying anything particularly revelational in its implications, but 10 minutes
1526400	1531040	in, it becomes a bit more implicative. I suggest we delve into that right now.
1538640	1542480	Now I don't want to go through this video step by step, because for some people who will be
1542480	1546480	familiar with the video already, that wouldn't be particularly helpful. So what I'm going to talk
1546480	1551760	about is how the video characterises Dan, and which situations Jay uses to back these claims
1552320	1556320	up. The first point that people in this situation thus far attested to is the
1556320	1561040	notion of the lack of empathy on Dan's part, which has led to hurtful things being said,
1561040	1566480	and Jay stays pretty consistent on this basis. He dives into how Daniel views the idea of shares.
1566480	1570880	On the basis of Dan's employee comments, Jay decides to break down exactly why those comments
1570880	1575520	were made, and the disparity between Stephen and Daniel's perspectives on a person's position
1575520	1580640	in a business. Stephen's not dumb, and to be honest, he's one of the probably the smarter
1580640	1586880	people that I met. He knows his self value, he knows his worth. The critical mistake that
1586880	1592080	Dan makes at this point wasn't just rejecting the share proposal and then gutting it to zero,
1592080	1603920	it's the implications behind that action. He had a very different unconventional definition
1603920	1609920	for shares. For Dan, a share was something precious that only the originals could get.
1610720	1618000	I just want to make a note that Dan's definition fluctuates greatly. Dan's definition of share
1618000	1623840	doesn't even revolve around money. It's just a special title under a special law.
1623840	1627840	Are you an original? No, then you get nothing. That was Dan's mindset.
1628400	1634560	So even if Stephen was there when Dan physically made the channel, just by the virtue of Stephen
1634560	1641440	not doing enough in Dan's eyes, Stephen's original title was withdrawn without even Stephen knowing.
1641440	1648160	So when Dan told Stephen that he's getting 0%, Dan implicitly told Stephen not only that is he worth
1648160	1658160	0% towards DanPlan, that he's not even a percentage worth towards DanPlan, he pretty much
1658160	1662880	also told him that he's not even viewed as an original. Dan was telling an important asset to
1662880	1668640	his company, DanPlan, who brings an enormous audience and had an immense potential regarding
1668640	1676080	his charisma, humor, that he was just a member, an employee. Dan told Stephen that implicitly
1676640	1682000	that he's a disposable unit, easily replaceable one. On the basis of these differing perspectives,
1682000	1686640	it made Daniel's comments even more insulting, even if they made sense to him at the time.
1686640	1690960	The fact that Stephen viewed shares as representative of contribution, and Daniel
1690960	1694880	telling Stephen that he was going to be receiving absolutely nothing, gave Stephen the impression
1694880	1699840	that Dan viewed his contribution as having no value whatsoever regardless of how much he was
1699840	1704880	being paid. Jay also outlines that if Stephen was there originally, Dan's reasoning that Stephen
1704880	1709600	didn't do enough meant that he wouldn't have been valued as a quote original either. Basically,
1709600	1714000	there were a plethora of excuses that Daniel could pull to make sure other associates were
1714000	1719680	locked down to the depository, but why was he locking people out? Well, the second attribute
1719680	1724400	I would use to describe Jay's perspective of Dan is nihilistic, indifferent, and that obviously
1724400	1728720	isn't going to be well received in a community with an emotionally invested audience. Jay claims
1728720	1734240	that Dan doesn't pay his animators well, often paying full-time animators around 450 Canadian
1734240	1739600	dollars a month, which is around 320 American dollars, not really sustainable for a full-time
1739600	1745680	job. It's a giant sweatshop. Originally, there were three animators when they just started off,
1745680	1754480	HOSA included, now they are at 12 without HOSA. They get paid an inconsistent $450 Canadian per
1754480	1761280	month at best, and I have seen one example of Dan actually guilt tripping and haggling animators for
1761280	1765760	their pricing. Jay does observe that there are part-time animators but claims that Daniel doesn't
1765760	1770080	really treat them differently or recognise the nuance. He also states that when surveying said
1770080	1775200	animators, a large majority, that being 8 out of 10 of them, weren't happy with the work environment.
1775280	1780080	The morale is low, there's no sense of community, the list goes on, but they say the same thing.
1780080	1785280	Dan is an insecure employer. Instead of polishing and motivating the current animator team,
1785280	1791360	all he does is just hire non-stop to replace those who leave the team. Because of this,
1792400	1800880	there is minimal difference between the full-time animators and the part-time animators. Another
1800880	1805120	issue that I found within the animation team is that they're no longer a community that they
1805120	1810560	hoped it was. Before, when it was three animators, maybe four, maybe five even, including HOSA,
1811360	1814640	they were a community, they talked to each other, they played games with each other,
1815440	1820720	they enjoyed their time with each other. Now, with 12 on the board, and I think there was more
1820720	1826400	before, that's no longer the case, they're essentially cubicle slaves. I don't see any
1826400	1831360	activity within the server, I don't see them talking to each other, and as far as you can
1831360	1835840	tell, they are just living in their own corner. In addition to this, Jay talks about the time
1835840	1840160	Daniel asked him to replace HOSA, given that HOSA is going away for a couple years.
1840160	1845360	HOSA agreed to this willingly. Basically, I was supposed to replace HOSA. HOSA has already
1845360	1851680	left Korea for his mandatory military service for the next two years. So, I decided to ask Dan
1851680	1857040	implicitly if I would get shares. The answer was no, I would get nothing. I was pretty much told
1857040	1861840	the same thing as Stephen, even though I was still technically one of the originals, I was there for
1861840	1866960	I believe the second video and onward, but I wasn't original enough for Dan.
1866960	1872400	Daniel once again presented no offer in return, before stating that he could receive an hourly
1872400	1877280	recording rate of $20, which once again, considering the money that Jay and Stephen
1877280	1882640	stipulate Daniel is making, is a rather laughable sum. How do you explain such behaviour? Well,
1882640	1887600	Jay implies really that as the owner and main benefactor of the channel, Dan recognises that
1887600	1892080	he has the power, and that as the man with the decision making power, he can make decisions that
1892080	1896480	are unfavourable to everyone else, and they will have to decide whether they like it or leave it.
1897040	1901680	Jay states that Daniel appears to treat the high turnover with a level of detachment, stating that
1901680	1906160	it's just the way it is, and that people come and go, so there's no real point in cultivating an
1906160	1910880	overly friendly environment. Dan seems to embrace the consequences, after all, if someone doesn't
1910880	1916160	like the job they're doing, they can just leave, right? That's how jobs work. But during my
1916160	1922800	investigation, he says this to me, and this is to quote Dan, people will leave eventually, no one
1922800	1927520	plans on staying at one place forever. And that was his excuse to do nothing about the animation
1927520	1933040	team, nothing else. If you want to leave, leave. I'm not telling you to stay here forever,
1933840	1938640	I'm not gonna do anything. I mean, on principle, yes, but Jay's issue extends to the fact that many
1938640	1943280	people don't have much of an option, they need to find work, and Dan plan is such an established
1943280	1946880	channel that people will work for it without question, which leads to a race to the bottom
1946880	1951600	regarding pay, and it's not that Daniel can't offer more, it's a question of whether he should,
1951600	1956000	but Dan doesn't really seem concerned with that, people come and go, and if they don't like working
1956000	1960960	for him, then they don't need to. It seems that sentiment extended to even cast members like
1960960	1967440	Steven. I warned Dan about this exact thing happening five months ago. On August 10th,
1967440	1973520	2019, after talking with Steven, Hosuh, and Dan when I was telling about the investigation,
1973520	1978240	I predicted that Steven would leave Dan plan, and due to certain promises with Dan,
1978800	1984640	I gave Dan a hypothetical. What will you do if someone leaves Dan plan? Let it be me,
1984640	1990320	Hosuh, Steven, or a group of animators, or just one single animator, what will you do? And this
1990320	1997440	was his response. To quote Dan, I don't care who leaves, this is my channel, and I will run it
1997440	2003360	based on my belief. If it sinks because of that, it sinks. That leads me to my next point, Jay's
2003360	2007600	implication that Dan is pretty arrogant. It's not just the fact that he's trying to get away with
2007600	2012560	paying people as little as possible, because he is allegedly indifferent, but he views himself as
2012560	2017120	the lifeblood of the channel. If he believes that people can come and go at any stage, then he must
2017120	2022240	believe in the power of his own talent, with or without his friends. Everyone else was disposable
2022240	2027120	but him, and if the channel went down, he went down with it. Which brings us to the next point,
2027120	2033120	determination. Dan told me that he would support me if I made my own channel, so that I can get
2033120	2037520	started there, but I wouldn't get anything from Dan plan, and that I would get referenced in his
2037520	2043360	channel. Basically publicity or exposure pay, and to quote Dan again, go make your own channel. I
2043360	2047280	will support you, give you shout outs, help you get sponsors, but you will never get a share from
2047280	2055200	Dan plan. For those who might not fully understand what Dan just said, Dan told one of his potentially
2055200	2060640	core members to go make his own company and earn money through that way, and that I would get
2060640	2065520	nothing from Dan plan, and that I won't get anything that I seemingly deserved.
2065520	2070960	Daniel had a vision of what Dan plan should be in the conflict regarding pay. Jay states that Dan
2070960	2075920	justified this by comparing it to VanossGaming, a significantly popular creator who boasts
2075920	2080800	highlights of him playing games with his friends, but Jay notes that this isn't really fair as the
2080800	2086720	creators at Vanoss all grew from the same position. For those who may not know Vanoss, he is like 10
2086720	2093680	plus, I forgot his sub count, but he is a giant in YouTube community who does a lot of collab work
2093680	2099920	with his online friends, but the difference between Vanoss and Dan plan is that when Vanoss
2099920	2107360	reached out to do collabs, they, everyone in that channel, already had their own channel,
2107360	2114000	like they, they were buddies because they were new and they worked together. What Dan was pretty
2114000	2119840	much telling us was, I know you have nothing, go make your own thing and do it that way.
2120560	2125520	Dan offered to pay Jay in various shout outs if Jay set up his own channel, but this wasn't what Jay
2125520	2131040	was interested in, and Jay found this suggestion insulting. But that was Dan's idea, he wanted his
2131040	2135840	channel, they could have theirs, his vision would not be compromised. Jay states that when he did
2135840	2140240	do some investigating into the problems of the channel, and raised the alarm, Dan told Jay to
2140240	2145120	stop interfering because Dan knew what he was doing. Maybe that was arrogance, but it's framed
2145120	2147760	as conscious enough to be assured in its final goal.
2147760	2152720	Jay- But his argument, or rebuttal for a lot of things that I said, or that I brought up, was that
2152720	2157840	he knew what he was doing. He knew what, or he was in this a lot longer and he's aware of it.
2157840	2164880	And basically he's denied or swept a lot of the crucial bits and pieces of the problem right
2164880	2172320	under. And his reply to my investigation was, to quote him, to quote Dan again,
2172320	2177840	Jay, from now on, don't ever interfere or dig around in the inner workings of the channel.
2177840	2183760	It's my channel. What he implied with that was basically, he told me to fuck off when I was
2183760	2184640	trying to help him.
2184640	2189840	Jay's perspective added a rationale behind the allegations, it gave Daniel's behaviour a sense of
2189840	2194400	logic, but not logic that was flattering in any sense at all. It frayed him as a person who was aware
2194400	2199520	of the relative power that he held, often using it to very little other than his status, using the
2199520	2204880	concept of free will to absolve wrongdoing. If you don't like it, leave, with the awareness that
2204880	2210720	really no one wanted to upset the apple cart. So now we have the stories, now we have an explanation,
2210720	2217520	however, this was just another perspective, and it wasn't Dan's. But whether Dan was innocent or not,
2217520	2222400	he was the kind of guy to reply, and oh boy, did he.
2234880	2244080	By this point, audience response was very sceptical towards Daniel. These videos painted him treating
2244080	2249280	the channel with a level of nonchalant darwinism, which harmed numerous friendships in the process.
2249280	2254480	Jay attests that he felt Dan stopped treating him as a friend and only messaged him for business purposes,
2254480	2256480	which seemingly upset him a lot.
2256480	2262880	I haven't heard Dan reach out to me just for the sake of saying hi. Whatever he did, it was always for
2262880	2268560	contact. Let me ask you guys something. Tell me a job or an occupation where you have an hourly
2268560	2274640	rate and is expected to be available upon call for your service or entertainment, with erratic
2274640	2280960	and inconsistent work hours, and that once your service and entertainment value is done, you are
2280960	2285760	shooed away, you're no longer contacted until your next service when you're next called, and you're
2285760	2290400	just an outsider even after frequent use. Because I'll tell you what I felt like when being told
2290400	2294880	like this. He was pretty much treating me like a call girl, a stripper or a hooker that he can
2294880	2300720	just call on dial on demand. It's actually really hard to damage my pride. I'm not the one to put
2300720	2308320	heavy pride value on the physical being called Jay, but kudos to Dan. He managed to piss me off to
2308320	2313360	a degree to the point of hurting my pride. These details did not merely harm Daniel's
2313360	2317680	personal image, but they compromised the whole premise of the DanPlan channel pushed by their
2317680	2321680	By The Way series, which was this bunch of friends getting along and having a good time.
2321680	2325760	DanPlan was the sort of channel where people just wanted to imagine that they were supporting good
2325760	2330480	people who were supporting each other, and that was the shock, and that's why people were upset.
2330480	2334720	Videos were uploaded, comments were left, a lot of people had a lot of strong feelings,
2334720	2339280	and yet in spite of that, a lot of these fans wanted to believe in Dan and they did not
2339280	2343840	write him off, which leads us to the 20th of January and Daniel's own response video,
2343840	2348560	and he's gone full black screen, full stop in the title, ladies and gentlemen,
2348560	2355280	we were in for a ride. Did Daniel save himself? Well, it's complicated, let me explain.
2355280	2359440	The first 23 minutes were a response to the initial video upload by Stephen,
2359440	2365280	and the next 32 were a bit of a sporadic response to Stephen's dream. Now each part has its flaws,
2365280	2370640	but not because I finished thinking it made Daniel a bad person, actually I'd argue it
2370640	2376800	humanised his perspective much more, but humanisation doesn't necessarily mean justification.
2376800	2381280	There's some good stuff here, there's some not so good stuff here, and it's not gonna break itself
2381280	2386480	down, so I suggest we dissect, while looking retrospectively at what the other videos presented
2386480	2391440	against him said and seeing how they hold up as well. I will try and get through everything,
2391440	2396480	there's gonna be a lot of discussion and a lot of opinions. Straight out the gate, if Daniel wants
2396480	2400720	some simple advice, it would be that he should have combined the receipts of the second part
2400720	2405120	with the structure of the first, it would have made it a lot more effective and impactful.
2405120	2408880	That said, it doesn't mean that we can't do that ourselves and see what it reveals.
2408880	2413360	For example, Dan tends to present the notion that Stephen had a tendency to ambush him.
2413360	2418000	He concedes that he had outbursts, even showing an apology that he sent to Stephen at the time
2418000	2422480	of the dispute, however, frames it from the perspective that Stephen had provoked him into
2422480	2430640	that reaction. On February 26th of 2019, Stephen asked if I could get on a call with him to discuss
2430640	2437360	about our VidCon and Disneyland trip, which made sense to me, so I said yes because I had to buy
2437360	2442240	him his tickets and I needed his passport information anyway, so I got on the call,
2442240	2447360	but that was not what he wanted to talk about. When I got on the call, instead of talking about
2447360	2453200	VidCon or Disneyland, him and another associate of his was on the other line. Stephen has said
2453200	2458400	that he heard from hosted that we were making more money now, so I said yes, but then Stephen
2458400	2465440	continued to say with his associate that if he doesn't get 33% of the company and the revenue,
2465440	2471600	that he is going to leave the channel. At the time, I felt betrayed that he held no remorse
2471600	2477120	of leaving, that he had no sympathy for our hard work, and that he suddenly changed his mind about
2477120	2483440	everything that he used to say about YouTube, now that we're making more money. Obviously, I was happy
2483440	2489360	to give him more money. We were making more money, so to pay him for his talents is fine, but I was
2489360	2495520	angry at his approach, so we fought. We didn't fight for one hour, we didn't fight for a day, we fought
2495520	2502240	for a couple of days. It was back and forth, and we have said a lot of things to each other, which
2502320	2509840	I apologized immediately after I got off the phone, and it wasn't pretty. I don't remember a lot of
2509840	2516560	things we said to each other, because it was 11 months ago, but the emotions are all still here.
2516560	2521680	In a way, this makes sense. Receipts back up that Stephen had baited Dan into a call. In a way,
2521680	2526160	it makes sense that he may have made some cruel comments in the heat of the moment. He doesn't seem
2526160	2531360	like an inherently cruel person, and even in the stream, Stephen made one comment that always stuck
2531360	2545440	to me. And I'm often less critical of streams, because they're not scripted, they're not organized,
2545440	2549600	you have to take what people say in the moment with a pinch of salt, but the structure of this comment
2549600	2553600	always said to me that he acknowledged that Dan may have been behaving irrationally at that point,
2553600	2559040	regardless of the fact that he said it, and Daniel admits it, it makes sense that maybe he'd be angry
2559040	2564560	at that point. This doesn't make the comment right, but with this situation, it adds up. I can see why
2564560	2570000	that would upset Stephen, and I'm not invalidating that, but Dan justifies why he would be upset too.
2570000	2574640	We say cruel things sometimes. However, for a moment, we need to remember that this dispute
2574640	2579280	didn't start in the call. The dispute started before the call, because there is a fundamental
2579280	2584320	difference in how these two people view contribution, and that disagreement is once again put
2584320	2590640	under the microscope in Dan's video. And in these parts, he can come across as a bit elitist.
2590640	2594960	For the rest of that summer, we put all our time and effort into making more videos,
2594960	2599840	in running the channel. Hosuh was drawing animations, I was writing scripts, I was editing,
2599840	2605520	and just overall just, you know, running the channel as a channel. It was a good time.
2605520	2612400	Stephen was just still coming on occasionally, recording, and then leaving for weeks or months at
2612400	2618160	a time while we did it, but that was okay too. He said he's doing this for fun, he's just doing this
2618160	2625040	a hobby, he didn't see it as a career, and we were all okay with that. As the channel grew, we started
2625040	2632720	making revenue, actual money. It was insane, and when it happened, it happened suddenly, and it was
2632720	2637520	something we never really expected. When we started to make money, I told Stephen that we
2637520	2643280	want to pay him. He declined, but I insisted that he at least take something for his time of
2643280	2650320	recording with us, so we mutually decided to pay him $25 an hour for his recording times. This is
2650320	2659200	where the $225 came into play, from September 22nd of 2018 to February 22nd of 2019. Of that six months,
2659200	2665200	he worked a total of nine hours, which was fine. I thought that was compensating something for his
2665200	2670000	time. He was having fun with his friends and getting some cash out of it. I didn't care if he
2670000	2674960	didn't work a lot, he wasn't taking YouTube seriously. And of course, I wanted to compensate him more,
2674960	2680320	so I was going to take him to Disneyland and VidCon, all expenses paid. We would have a lot of fun.
2680320	2687920	The fact that he valued his 30 to 40 minutes of recording, the same with the amount of sacrifice
2687920	2694800	and effort the whole set I put onto the channel was insulting, and it made me angry.
2694800	2699520	Now in principle, I can understand why Daniel would clearly view this input as somewhat limited,
2699520	2704400	and not to the degree that he has committed. But everyone who's involved with YouTube knows that
2704400	2709760	firstly, a creative job extends beyond recording, and in Stephen's video, he vocally calls attention
2709760	2714560	to the characters that he fleshed out, and the effort that he put in. He may have recorded for
2714560	2719520	a certain amount of time, but the impact and the thought of these characters exist beyond that.
2719520	2723440	Informal Mafia Stephen, Huggy Zombie Apocalypse Stephen,
2723440	2729120	Mahosa Stephen. Daniel didn't give me a script to do those characters, I made them up,
2729120	2734800	and I made my personalities enjoyable. But to Daniel, every recording session, I was merely
2734800	2739520	talking to friends. To him, I wasn't putting in any effort into the videos.
2739520	2742960	On top of this, it's important to remember, it's not just about the amount of work one does,
2742960	2747440	but their contribution to the branding and image of the channel. If your face is on the merch,
2747440	2751680	if you're advertised besides the brands, if people come for your quotes in the videos,
2751680	2756640	that's prospective income based on viewership and support. It doesn't matter if that character was
2756640	2760960	fostered in 5 minutes or 5 years, because a majority of financial income for these sorts
2760960	2765440	of channels will come from the audience connection with the character. A characterisation that brings
2765440	2769680	people entertainment or hope, or anything of the sorts is not something you can base
2769680	2774000	solely on the work behind the scenes, even if it is significantly more difficult than the work
2774000	2778720	in front of the camera or the microphone. The first abject disagreement we encounter
2778720	2783920	though is regarding negotiation details. Stephen states that in the call he requested a 20%
2783920	2788160	share of income, which is corroborated by Jay. Daniel frames it much more harshly,
2788160	2792720	stating that Stephen demanded a third of the income share, or else he was going to walk.
2792720	2799280	Stephen continued to say with his associate that if he doesn't get 33% of the company
2799280	2802400	and the revenue that he is going to leave the channel.
2802400	2806800	Now this point was anticipated in Jay's video, that clip I told you to keep in mind.
2806800	2811520	Some people have used this as a means to invalidate Daniel's point, but anticipating what some will
2811520	2816320	say does not necessarily mean it's invalid unless you have solid evidence for that assertion,
2816320	2821120	and all Jay stated was that Dan may be confused as someone else proposed it. Now this may be the
2821120	2825760	mysterious figure that Daniel alluded to, however there is very little detail regarding the identity
2825760	2830560	of this additional person, other than they would need to have been physically with Stephen at that
2830560	2835520	point, as we can see the 7 minute call was between two users. Due to Stephen's streaming comments,
2835520	2838960	some people have said it was Hosuh, but I think in Stephen's video and streams,
2838960	2843120	he was implying that Hosuh had been negotiating following the call rather than in the call.
2843520	2848480	And I made Hosuh get involved as well. Hosuh, I really am sorry that I made you get involved
2848480	2853760	in my fight, but I'm also really grateful that you did. What I do find strange is following these
2853760	2859360	aggressive negotiations, that they then settled on a still rather underwhelming $100 per video
2859360	2864000	Stephen, which if you consider the alleged income of the channel is still less than 1%.
2864000	2869360	I insisted that he at least take something for his time of recording with us, so we mutually
2869360	2873600	decided to pay him $25 an hour for his recording times.
2873600	2878960	Daniel signals that he insisted Stephen took 25 per hour of recording prior to these negotiations,
2878960	2883520	despite Stephen's apparent refusal at the time, and uses it like he's a generous guy,
2883520	2887920	but then decides not to insist Stephen have any more after his apparent aggressive
2887920	2891920	dissatisfaction. It doesn't add up here, and that's not the only thing.
2891920	2900880	After the March incident, we renegotiated my salary, or rather the amount of pay I was getting.
2902240	2909600	And I remember him saying, what do you want to get paid now? I said $100, $100 per video.
2909600	2913440	I didn't say that, but he offered it, and I was like, okay, fine, whatever.
2913440	2918880	And then afterwards, he said, okay, I hope you know that $100 is a lot of money.
2918880	2926160	He says that I made him take the $100 per video, and that I guilt-tripped him into taking it,
2926160	2933360	and I forced him to take it. These are untrue. At the end of our fight, when he decided to stay,
2933360	2938800	he then told me that he wants $100 per video. He could have said more.
2940720	2946320	I would have not mined that. That wasn't the point of the fight. That was not the point of the
2946320	2946820	argument.
2950000	2954640	When I say I find these details strange, I don't mean I find them strange in the sense that they
2954640	2959280	incriminate Daniel, but it equally doesn't make me think that this is a one-sided affair, or that
2959280	2964320	he's blasted these allegations away. Unless Stephen planned out how to throw the channel
2964320	2968800	under the bus in a dramatic way ten months in advance, which there is no evidence of,
2968800	2973040	I have trouble seeing this specific argument as anything else than a couple guys with vastly
2973040	2977040	different perspectives clashing furiously over them, realising that it wasn't getting them
2977040	2982640	anywhere, and coming to some sort of reconciliation with the expectation that, for both of their sides,
2982640	2987040	it could improve. But it wasn't a real reconciliation, because the initial problem
2987040	2992240	that provoked it was still there. Both sides are just full of interpretations that view the other
2992240	2997200	perspective in unequivocally bad faith. Stephen says that Dan claiming something's a lot of money
2997200	3002160	was manipulation, when he might just be a stingy person. Dan states that Stephen was claiming that
3002160	3006320	Daniel tricked him into taking less money, but Stephen never claimed that because he notes that
3006320	3010960	they'd already agreed on a figure. As for who proposed it, who knows, as most of the fans
3010960	3016800	recognised it was like watching an embarrassing divorce. Daniel's video can be equally as cynical
3016800	3021360	as Stephen's, they have highly cynical perspectives on each other's actions. For example, Stephen
3021360	3027120	viewed his request of asking what more he can do as a genuine plea to try and earn his place on the
3027120	3031840	channel and a greater share of the business, and Dan's perspective didn't connect with me at all
3031840	3038320	about this. But when he saw that his initial strategy wasn't working, during our argument,
3038880	3045920	he switched and said, what can I do to get more percentage? At that point, I realised that
3046640	3053200	appreciation or more involvement wasn't what he was looking for, but more profit. That's why we
3053200	3057440	fought. Like you say you considered him a friend at all points, and then say something like that.
3057440	3060880	Like you acknowledge it was a heat of the moment argument, but then make a point which would
3060880	3066240	question his intent regardless in that moment. And it's not like I think Dan is at liberty to
3066240	3070880	give anyone any more of a management role in his channel. From the perspective of management,
3070880	3075200	if that's what he wants to retain, then that is fair. Dan wanted control of the channel,
3075200	3080080	I don't think he's completely arrogant as other videos have portrayed, but I do think he likes
3080080	3084400	to do things his way, and he didn't want interference, he wants to be the director,
3084400	3089520	and that's okay. But I think Stephen genuinely wanted to justify and solidify his role,
3089520	3094320	but I don't think Dan had anything to offer. I don't know if Dan's trying to completely
3094320	3098000	shield his image, but an explanation like this would make much more sense than the
3098000	3102720	clumsy account that he provided. I think the main problem here was that there was no real
3102720	3107440	way to justify that someone's character was worth less than 1% of the channel's worth,
3107440	3111840	and by not offering even a share of that, it clearly left a bad taste in Stephen's mouth.
3111840	3116000	In his original video, Stephen states that he asked a very specific question twice,
3116000	3117680	asking how much his worth is.
3133840	3140080	And although he left details out of Dan's reply in the DMs, the political, vague nature
3140080	3145440	is highly unsatisfying. Simple as Stephen wanted to know his worth, but I don't think Dan either
3145440	3150880	knew or wanted to think about it. This is also why he probably offered to help Stephen in the
3150880	3154960	creation of his own channel, this sentiment was echoed in Jay's video, and although Dan didn't
3154960	3159040	get the chance to respond to that one, it was a similar message, he wanted to help grow his
3159040	3163280	friends' own channels, and shout them out, even mentioning VanossGaming.
3163280	3172720	I suggested an idea to Stephen, that we make him a channel, a channel of his own, a company
3172720	3179360	that he can run. I did this for a couple of main reasons. One, so that he can have the freedom
3179360	3185840	to create, and the business decisions that he wants to make is his own. Two, I wanted him to
3185840	3195360	learn how much effort, and time, and sacrifice it takes to run a channel. And lastly, I wanted us to
3195360	3203920	have a partnership. Once I realized he wanted to take YouTube seriously, I wanted him to make a
3203920	3208960	channel of his own, where we would promote it, where we would try to help it grow, where I would
3208960	3217280	give him and suggest things that help a channel to grow faster, and hopefully develop a relationship
3217280	3223760	like, you know, the VanossGaming group, or the David Dobrik group, but he declined.
3223840	3228240	Once again, it just seems like a fundamental disagreement of how they wanted to operate.
3228240	3232880	Not everyone wants their own channel, and it's a very strange philosophy that Daniel has, though I
3232880	3239040	think he genuinely believes it. He wants you to understand the sacrifice. It's daft. And of course,
3239040	3243200	Stephen would have been able to understand the work if Daniel had given him a way to earn his share,
3243200	3247520	but Daniel didn't value his intent at that point. If you didn't want someone to expect more from
3247520	3250960	a channel that their face is featured on, you shouldn't have let them on the channel.
3250960	3255280	On top of this, the character dynamic in gaming videos like Vanoss is so unbelievably different
3255280	3260400	to the BTW series that there's no real way to draw a parallel which justifies that point of view.
3260400	3264480	I would argue that with gaming channels, there are many more other in-game factors that can
3264480	3269360	influence the entertainment value of the content and its marketability, and although there are
3269360	3273680	other elements to consider with Dan Plan's animated content too, the interplay between
3273680	3278880	the cast is such a significant selling point, it's not the same. I do wonder if Daniel had a
3278880	3283360	legitimate nostalgia for his gaming days and the creative control that it gave him.
3283360	3288480	In spite of all these points, the way situation does go both ways. Dan stated that it was Stephen
3288480	3293600	who offered the $100 rate that they switched to, so the responsibility of that fact has to
3293600	3298640	partly lie on him, providing it's true. But Stephen's point after this argument wasn't that
3298640	3303440	he wasn't satisfied with the money, but that no matter how hard he tried, he wasn't recognised,
3303440	3308640	he didn't feel like he was a friend, he wanted to be noticed by Dan, he wanted to be credited by Dan,
3308640	3312480	and he wasn't. He portrays himself as not being obsessed with the money,
3312480	3314320	in fact, rather claiming Dan was.
3338640	3346960	And when Stephen quit Dan Plan,
3347520	3353200	he's told me that he still wants to be paid for all the videos that will be posted in the future,
3353200	3357120	which I said I would honour, but then on the livestream he goes on to say
3369040	3370960	which contradicts what he texted me.
3370960	3375440	But this is one of the weaker rebuttals again, you don't have to care specifically about the
3375440	3379680	money to still want it for the work you've done, because it could be about what the money
3379680	3384480	represents, a recognition of one's work that they've put in. I don't care about sponsor money
3384480	3389360	that much, but when I do the sponsor, I still expect the payments, for my own personal pride,
3389360	3394080	to know that I'm worth it. If he really cared about the money, I find it unlikely that he would
3394080	3398240	have settled for such a proportionally low amount given how much the audience valued him,
3398240	3403440	regardless of Dan's perspective. It's very easy to blow up this drama, and it did blow up,
3403440	3408320	and everyone piled on, but you can't lose sight of what inspired it, the fact that a person just
3408320	3413120	didn't feel like he was part of a family that the audience perceived as existing. That's what you
3413120	3418160	had to combat, and in a way Dan did combat that, but he kind of misses the point again.
3418160	3422400	If I really thought of him nothing more than an employee, I would have never taken him to
3422400	3428960	VidCon or Disneyland. If I was not friends with him, I wouldn't be friends with him.
3430080	3440640	If I thought that I didn't think of him as a friend, I wouldn't invite him to go camping
3440640	3448640	with me. I wouldn't introduce him to my girlfriend or my family. I wouldn't take him to camping.
3448640	3452640	I wouldn't try to go watch movies with him. I wouldn't invite him to the parties I would
3452640	3456720	only invite my friends over to. There are no real receipts provided for this,
3456720	3460640	I'll provide benefit of the doubt that they probably happened, because it doesn't change
3460640	3465520	the point. The point was that whatever happened outside of YouTube, it was an insult to Stephen
3465520	3469920	Howe he was treated on the channel. He felt like an employee, he felt perceived as one,
3469920	3475440	and I believe that. I struggle to imagine doing a collaborative channel with a legitimate friend
3475440	3480560	and not having a shares-based agreement, but simply put, I don't think Daniel viewed it as
3480560	3483760	collaborative. I think that no matter what happened in their discussion, no matter how
3483760	3489040	angry they got, the fact that they never came to the agreement that there was a way to share income
3489040	3494000	was the most indicative factor in the failure of their friendship, because a share is not just
3494000	3500080	worth, it is trust, and there was no trust here. It's claimed that Daniel doesn't even share income
3500080	3504960	details with Hosuh, but that is not mentioned. Dan references the trips to Disneyland and VidCon,
3504960	3509280	but Stephen himself, in the stream that Dan responded to, said that he felt the intent
3509280	3514880	wasn't there. When we went to Disneyland is pretty much when I thought it was getting better.
3517760	3519840	But then I saw Daniel pull out a camera.
3522480	3528000	And then I knew for a fact that he just wanted me to dance. So I danced.
3531840	3534480	And then I knew for a fact that things weren't going to get better.
3535600	3540560	In the Disneyland video itself, uploaded to DanPlan, Stephen makes a pretty snide quip
3540560	3551360	that was left in. That aside, because Dan was quite possessive regarding what he viewed as
3551360	3557600	his own channel, Stephen interpreted it as a sense of worth, and greater, trust. Maybe it was to an
3557600	3562560	extent, I don't know, but I don't think it was necessarily malice on Dan's behalf, I think it
3562560	3568000	was ignorance. And I think that ignorance was willful to an extent. I forgot to mention at
3568000	3573120	the end of the video because I got a little emotional, but for transparency sake, I want
3573120	3578160	to say that I have heard whispers of Stephen planning to do something along the lines of
3578160	3583200	making a video after he left, so it wasn't a hundred percent surprise when it happened.
3583760	3589360	Nevertheless, the content was still upsetting, and that's why it was still very shocking.
3589680	3599680	I wanted to end the video there, I didn't want to say anything more, that was just my side of the story.
3599680	3604720	I don't think Dan was that shocked. I think the strains must have been clear, and Dan didn't do
3604720	3609440	enough to avert it because he probably never considered the consequences, and when he did,
3609440	3614400	it was probably too late. But that's not necessarily a one-way street.
3620240	3627600	A lot of public drama on this scale happens because one party decides that actually, they don't want to
3627600	3632080	talk it out privately, they want to go nuclear, they want to call someone else. Now, Stephen's
3632080	3637200	video isn't your typical call-out post, it doesn't seem tailor-made to be a channel-ending video,
3637200	3642640	but I think its impact spoke volumes to how people viewed him as a part of the channel. However, with
3642640	3647840	the whole future of the channel in jeopardy, was it worth it, and was it the right thing to do?
3647840	3652000	In Daniel's response video, he posts various conversations between himself and Stephen.
3652000	3656640	The relevant conversation showed the aftermath of Stephen's private departure from the channel.
3656640	3661200	Daniel is very attentive after Stephen lists out his personal issues, suggesting twice that they
3661200	3665280	meet up, which is something that Daniel himself references in his response video.
3665280	3670640	So first things first, before he released that video, I already wanted to talk to him in person,
3670640	3677920	in regards to him leaving, I asked him once after he left to meet up, he said he wanted to do an
3677920	3683040	a call but we never got in a call, and then later he texted me again and I said, let's please meet
3683040	3688400	up, let's have some coffee, but he declined again. Daniel knew there was an issue, he wanted to resolve
3688400	3693520	it privately, however, sometimes things shouldn't just be talked about privately, sometimes we do
3693520	3697920	need to go public with our grievances to make sure that a person is held to account. There are plenty
3697920	3702800	of situations where such a promotion can help other people come forward with their own problems,
3702800	3707440	and plenty of times a private conversation with a coercive person can help suppress possible
3707440	3712560	consequences facing down a person, and postpone the ultimate confrontation, and maybe make this
3712560	3718240	person's abuse of power even worse. Sometimes it can be an intimidation tactic, but it's hard to tell
3718240	3723120	with a lot of people, was going public relevant here, especially in the way that Stephen did?
3723120	3727360	Let's talk about it. Well, firstly, I think what we have to discuss is why on earth Stephen
3727360	3732320	decided not to talk it out in private, in fact, why he never indicated at all that he planned to
3732320	3737360	make a video, while still talking to Dan at that time. To many people, such behaviour would seem
3737360	3742000	pretty sneaky, and to be honest, they're not inherently wrong. If we discount the idea that he
3742000	3746560	had malintent, why would he do this? I think the one quote that explains it is here.
3746560	3756400	So, do I think there was any way to avoid the situation? No. A heavy hand is only moved by a heavier
3756400	3761440	hand. He viewed it as imperative that he do this, but many would argue going off Stephen and Daniel's
3761440	3765600	videos that this conflict was clearly avoidable. However, in the streams there are some details
3765600	3771200	which I found quite important, such as this. After our fight, Hosuh was still talking to Dan about
3771200	3779680	getting money out to other people, to the animators, to me, to everyone else, but Daniel was so stubborn
3779680	3787120	and he thinks that his wages are okay. They clearly aren't. I will get into the wage issue
3787120	3794480	after, but it was just not, and Hosuh and me were not passive in this.
3794480	3799280	Now, Daniel doesn't respond to every stream point, and he doesn't have to, but I am surprised he
3799280	3803200	didn't respond to this one, as to me, it's an important detail that could decide whether a
3803200	3808800	situation is avoidable or not. Also, I want to briefly mention about Hosuh, because Stephen
3808800	3815440	talks about Hosuh. Due to the possible legal implications that may come out affecting Hosuh
3815440	3821920	negatively, I'm not going to talk about the transactions and terms we have come to an
3821920	3827360	agreement to. It's something that we both have come to an agreement with. That's all I will say.
3828160	3834960	Him and I are still good business-wise. It's something that had to happen, and it's something
3834960	3841840	that really can't be talked about online. It's a private matter, and that's it.
3841840	3846960	He cites legal ramifications in declining to talk about certain details regarding Pay and Hosuh,
3846960	3851360	but I don't think the idea that Hosuh was negotiating on behalf of his friends would fall
3851360	3855760	under that. Now, for argument's sake, I'm going to assume that Stephen's perspective is the case,
3855760	3860960	and that Hosuh was indeed attempting to negotiate with Dan, and that Dan rebuffed these negotiations
3860960	3865360	and showed no intention to alter Pay. Essentially, at the end of these failed negotiations,
3865360	3869760	Stephen receives the impression that there is nothing he can say or do to receive a little more
3869760	3875280	respect. Hosuh was fighting for more Pay, that did not occur. They exhausted every option privately.
3875280	3879600	So that's the first half of whether a situation is worth going public about, but what about the
3879600	3884160	second? Well, I think this is the key one, and it may explain why he lied about jumping into a call
3884160	3888320	regarding Disneyland, and why he didn't bring anything up prior to the video, and that is
3888320	3917680	manipulation.
3917680	3921920	Stephen clearly had the expectation that if he had brought it up with Dan, Dan would be able to
3921920	3926400	talk Stephen out of it. This is a problem of perspective, because in Dan's mind, he would have
3926400	3931040	had the opportunity to persuade Stephen with his numerous facts and logic, and in Stephen's mind,
3931040	3935840	Dan would manipulate him into a position where he doesn't speak up and his story isn't told.
3935840	3940880	Which perspective is true? Well, it really depends on what happened specifically behind the scenes,
3940880	3945840	details that haven't really been admitted or conceded by either side. Stephen speculated,
3945840	3950720	and Daniel dodged, neither of which are conclusive. I guess it made sense in Stephen's
3950720	3954800	head what he was doing, and like Daniel, he probably didn't consider all the consequences of
3954800	3959040	not confronting it and diving head first in the video, and it's hard to say that what's happened
3959040	3963200	to Daniel specifically and DanPlan is completely justified.
3963200	3968400	After Daniel posts his video, I want to sit down with him and actually talk things out.
3969360	3973760	I do truly want to resolve this, because there are still people working on DanPlan
3974560	3978080	who are being mistreated, and I don't want that to happen to them.
3980320	3985520	So yeah, I want to resolve this. Not for my sake, because I honestly don't want his money anymore.
3987040	3990480	He does seem quite torn on his own feelings regarding Daniel,
3990480	3994880	and he may well have been questioning whether he did the right thing. It's a good question.
3994880	4000400	Was undermining the image of a friend and his channel once to even help build a justified
4000400	4004800	response to the perception of an injustice perpetrated by a colleague, one that did not
4004800	4009280	seem like it was going to resolve itself otherwise? Maybe not, but what would the middle
4009280	4013280	ground have been? I think that's the question for discussion today. It's just a shame that Stephen
4013280	4017600	did have such a cynical perception of Dan, to believe that every message with a smiley face,
4017600	4022400	every trip posted onto YouTube had some ulterior motive. This wasn't helped when Jay said in his
4022400	4026720	video that he felt like Dan only messaged him when he had something to gain. It brings into
4026720	4031840	question all the niceties. Being nice doesn't make you a good person, and some people can be awfully
4031840	4036000	friendly while twisting the knife in other aspects. And that's how Stephen saw Daniel,
4036000	4041360	a shining smile with teeth of daggers, and Stephen decided to take it down. By doing this,
4041360	4045920	Stephen also broke a prospective agreement that he made with Dan, which was to wait out his position
4045920	4050080	until Hosuh had left the channel. This was detailed in Daniel's video again.
4050080	4056080	Nevertheless, I still compensate Stephen for each video that he's in. And that was the agreement
4056080	4063200	that we made. My side of the agreement was that we try and get past this. And on top of that,
4063760	4069680	that because Hosuh is leaving for military and we both knew at the time, I wanted the channel and
4069680	4076800	the community to be still the same when he came back. So I wanted Stephen to stay at least until
4076800	4082160	then and we can figure something out from there on. Even the day when he left the channel,
4082160	4089360	December 15th or 16th, I supported him. I told him that it was upsetting that he was leaving
4089360	4094000	and that even though he is breaking his end of the deal, I won't break my end of the deal.
4094640	4101040	And that I want us to transition through this smoothly and I want him to succeed in his own
4101040	4106640	pursuits and in his chapter and in his channel. Now I must say I find it strange that moving past
4106640	4112160	an argument would be included in a deal. Feelings like that cannot really be defined by the fabric
4112160	4117440	of such. I feel that Dan wanted to move on so badly and he just didn't know what else to do but
4117440	4122000	put it in a pact. I can understand why Stephen not following through on this may be cause for critique,
4122000	4127280	however, more on the side that he made the deal in the first place after such a volatile argument,
4127280	4133040	one that both sides frame as extremely involved. Now, I would also add that in the DM shown by
4133040	4137760	Daniel himself, Stephen seems to contest that this deal was ever made, which gives me the impression
4137760	4142160	that it wasn't particularly formal, but let's entertain the idea that this deal is a thing for
4142160	4146880	argument's sake. Binding deals are a bad idea unless you both have a similar level of influence
4146880	4151040	in that deal, or else one's always going to feel at risk of being taken advantage of. Now, you
4151040	4155680	might make a deal like that as a friend, but as Stephen no longer viewed Dan as a friend when he
4155680	4160400	broke the deal, he therefore had no reason to commit to it. Deals like those are to be made
4160400	4165120	between equals, and Stephen no longer felt like an equal, so he had no reason to honour it.
4165120	4170560	Why he made the deal in the first place, I don't know, maybe he felt bad, maybe it was for Hosuh,
4170560	4176240	they clearly have a close bond, but whatever it was, it was buried six feet deep by January.
4176240	4182720	And even during the first video, which was carefully written and planned and edited,
4193840	4200320	he doesn't mention anything about not attacking me, but then posts a community tab later saying,
4200320	4204800	oh yeah, don't attack Daniel. Consequences were more severe than most would have anticipated,
4204800	4209120	and his mixed feelings did lead to him often swinging back and forth about how he feels
4209120	4213600	regarding the outcome. Daniel picks these out and criticises him quite harshly.
4213600	4219120	He mentions at the beginning of his live stream, don't attack Dan. I appreciate that,
4219120	4227120	I honestly do, but the statement that he makes isn't consistent with what he goes on to say,
4228080	4232640	where he says he's using you guys as a weapon, even though he doesn't want to.
4232640	4238800	Because Dan didn't give me recognition for one mil, so I'm going to take away his two mil,
4238800	4245040	and I find that pretty hilarious. Of course, I am using you guys as a weapon then, so if you want
4245040	4252320	to unsubscribe, by all means, go ahead. If you want to keep being subscribed, by all means, go ahead.
4252320	4256000	Or to unsubscribe, if they feel like it.
4256000	4260400	However, Daniel's clip of the stream does omit Stephen's then sudden pivot back to
4260400	4263760	reasonability and recognition that this would be a bad idea.
4263760	4268960	If you want to unsubscribe, by all means, go ahead. If you want to keep being subscribed,
4269520	4276400	by all means, go ahead. I don't want to use you guys as a weapon, that's so cowardly on my part.
4278240	4281360	So I would never say do or don't, do something.
4281360	4285680	As said, streaming brings out a spontaneity of people that can be fundamentally emotional
4285680	4290160	and bitter, and this is clearly an emotional topic. You have to take that into consideration
4290160	4293360	when making your arguments, but unfortunately, both of these people
4293360	4297760	didn't see the intent in the other side. This was a personal battle that Stephen fought,
4297760	4303280	but by the stream and Jay's video, it became a greater question about another oppressed minority,
4303280	4306240	and I'm not talking about gamers. Who was it then?
4306240	4321440	To an extent, both parties could have been more proactive, but as the guy in charge of the channel,
4321440	4326400	Daniel did make a real mistake by treating someone who is part of the brand as a part-time rep,
4326400	4328240	financially or personally.
4328240	4336000	Now this doesn't mean I'm not frugal, I grew up poor, I am a cheap person just because of the way
4336000	4343280	I was raised, I am not insensitive to finances just because I'm now dealing with a larger sum
4343280	4351840	of money. Each transaction I'm very careful with, and I am very cautious in making those transactions.
4351840	4356800	Now in his response video, Daniel does admit he has a tendency to be cheap, and I think that's fine.
4356800	4361440	It's good that he's being open about it, some openness will hopefully have improvement in the future,
4361440	4365440	however, he does dedicate a significant proportion of the video to the animators.
4365440	4370480	The animators and just crew in general, I feel super bad for dragging them into this,
4371360	4376320	because in my head, one of the scenarios that could play out is literally him just burning
4376320	4383440	the entire channel to the ground, letting it die, and then leaving all the animators and crew in
4383440	4391600	general to do nothing, because this is a job for them. First and foremost, I've already apologized
4391600	4398480	to them privately, but I want to apologize again. I am sorry that all of you are caught up in this.
4398480	4405680	It's not your problem that Stephen and I had a spat, and it's not your problem that we are
4405680	4412400	taking this out in publicly. You should not be involved in this. I know it's not just stress for
4412400	4420000	me, but for you all as well, and I am so so so sorry that you're involved in this. Now the animators
4420000	4424400	are a pretty sacred talking point, they're this mystical third party who neither side can
4424400	4428720	necessarily lay claim to, so each faction definitely panders to the narrative that works
4428720	4433520	best for them, while leaving out a few relevant details. Now, animators are not at the forefront
4433520	4437760	of the channel, but they do provide a significant contribution, and it is accepted that they would
4437760	4442640	be paid for such a contribution. After Stephen's video, there were rumblings about the status of
4442640	4447040	animators, and if they'd experienced a similar side of Daniel's behaviour, be that his treatment
4447040	4453440	of them, or his payment. The more I dove into it, the more I realized how many more people were
4453440	4459120	being screwed. This is not just a me problem anymore. When I started digging, I started asking
4459120	4464640	the animators, how much were you getting paid? And the answers kept being the same, about $450
4464640	4471520	per month. For a month of work, they get $450, and it's not even consistent, because sometimes
4471520	4477920	it takes more than a month to make a video, but you still get $450. $450, let's say $450,
4477920	4486240	just to be generous, for a month's work. That is insane. If my boss was paying me $450 for working
4486240	4491280	full-time, I'd quit the job. The word full-time was thrown around a lot. Part-time was mentioned
4491280	4496160	too, but the main allegations came from how he treated his quote, full-time animators.
4496160	4504000	What it means to work for a company full-time, is that you are implying that I will work for you
4504640	4512160	for this amount of set of hours, consistently, and I am trusting this company to give me financial
4512160	4519360	stability of my work. So basically, I will ensure that I give you my full-time of work,
4520320	4530240	and in return, I want a consistent, safe, monetary, like, reciprocation. I give you work,
4530240	4537840	you give me money. That is not the case. There is very, very, very little difference between
4537840	4543520	part-time animators and full-time animators. The full-time maybe get paid a little bit more,
4543520	4550240	who knows, but as far as I can tell, it's still inconsistent, it's still grossly underpaid,
4551440	4556160	and there's almost no benefits. Daniel has essentially trapped any animator
4556720	4560960	who actually wants to make a living just by paying them like slave wages,
4562000	4567200	while still making them work full-time. Now full-time is quite a loaded word in western
4567200	4571280	society. It generally refers to a person who works a set amount of hours and obtains their
4571280	4576800	primary source of income from that job. The figure that was also thrown around was $450 a
4576800	4581440	month, although they state that payment was inconsistent as a ballpark figure for a full-time
4581440	4585760	job. Anyone will tell you that is unacceptable, and if Dan Plan was doing that, then he should
4585760	4590000	be called out. However, he contests this immediately, and shows receipts to back it up.
4590640	4597280	I don't make them sign anything, and if I were to have hired them full-time to make them sign
4597280	4604000	something where they can't get out and then not pay them properly, that's illegal.
4604000	4609440	First of all, they don't sign anything. It's a verbal agreement, and it's second of all,
4609440	4615680	not a full-time employment. No one has mentioned this, and I don't know why. They are what is
4615680	4622000	called subcontractors. They are contractors. That is what the type of job that they have.
4622000	4628240	They do a contracted job for a project. In this case, it's a video, and it's completely different
4628240	4635360	from a wage-based job. They do their own work as their own entity, and on the project that we
4635360	4644160	request, we both agree on a price. When we mutually agree on the price, they then work on the video
4644160	4652080	itself. People keep on bringing up full-time or part-time or whatever. It just doesn't make any
4652080	4659520	sense, and that is not the type of agreement that I have with the animators. If I were to hire
4659520	4665440	somebody in a different manner, that would be a different story, but this isn't that case. When
4665440	4673920	I interview them, I always ask how much they want to be paid per video, and Stephen says that they
4673920	4678880	come into this job without knowing anything. Now, subcontractual work is completely different,
4678880	4683040	because you're paying for the completion of a job. You don't know how many hours they're working or
4683040	4687200	how consistently they're working. You have a job, you have a deadline, and you hope it's done in
4687200	4691920	time. I must admit, I find it strange that as a person providing a recurrent job on a regular
4691920	4696800	basis, he doesn't have a set price in his head, and asks animators what they want to be paid.
4696800	4701200	Daniel is an established creator with a lot of influence, and an animator who will want to be
4701200	4705520	hired for future jobs may lure their prices for competitiveness. If it was a one-off job,
4705520	4709040	or a field that he was inexperienced in, it would make more sense.
4709040	4713760	And I thought that if they weren't happy with it, they could always talk to me, because I was
4714400	4722800	approachable to them. It doesn't excuse the fact that I am in the position that I'm in,
4723360	4732560	which means that since I am the boss or a YouTuber, that because of who I am,
4732560	4738000	and the relationship that I have with them, and the business point of view, that it is
4738000	4746240	harder to approach me, no matter what I do. And if that is what the audience felt,
4746240	4753360	and if that's what the animators felt, I sincerely apologize. I am sorry.
4753360	4757760	Now, Dan does admit that he made a mistake by not being more proactive in the video,
4757760	4762320	I do appreciate that, and there are many subcontractors who do have their own pre-established
4762320	4768240	prices, however, it's hard to apply that without a clear amount of work for a video established.
4768240	4774160	Nonetheless, it is just a side point, and I will digress. Does this mean he was paying good price?
4774160	4779200	Not really. I'm not an animator myself, I did briefly speak to an animator involved who felt
4779200	4783280	that given the work per frame and the consideration that the animator storyboarded
4783280	4788160	the videos to, this payment was not sufficient in comparison to the other work they have been doing
4788160	4793440	since DanPlan. It also depends on the amount of negotiation that occurred prior, and as went over
4793440	4797840	earlier, we're not really receiving a clear narrative on that front. On top of this, in Jay's
4797840	4803680	video, he also references Hosuh, who is an animator himself, and his opinion on how much the animators
4803680	4804800	should be paid.
4804800	4810000	Hosuh- This is coming from Hosuh directly. In Hosuh's opinion, the videos created by the animators
4810000	4813840	are worth at least $1500 Canadian per video.
4813840	4817760	Now, this is not coming from Hosuh directly, but Hosuh hasn't challenged it either,
4817760	4822480	and has since worked with Jay. That doesn't exactly prove he said it, but it's another relevant nugget
4822480	4827680	of information to consider regardless. Unfortunately, in this situation, the receipts were rather low.
4827680	4831360	Some question whether the animators could have gone on strike, but unfortunately, if they viewed
4831360	4835440	their roles expendable given the high turnover of staff, then Dan could have just sacked them.
4835440	4839440	If they weren't really that much of a community, then it would have been even harder to organise.
4839440	4843280	Of course, this begs the question of why this was not raised more when Hosuh was supposedly
4843280	4848480	negotiating or Jay investigating. Well, probably because no party wanted to initiate civil war with
4848480	4852560	the hope that it would improve, but problems seldom disappear without confrontation, or else
4852560	4856560	the person would be ignorant, and although I think Dan was willfully ignorant to an extent,
4856560	4861200	I think the animator issue here was probably a collateral outcome of the drama which could have
4861200	4865840	been avoided in hindsight. There are also claims after Daniel's video that he had cherry picked
4865840	4870480	examples that supported his case, and this may be somewhat true, but unfortunately, there's not
4870480	4875360	too much that can be done at this point, you'd need evidence of the contrary, simple ads.
4875360	4882000	It's not fair to the animators that are coming on with zero knowledge and essentially being put
4882000	4888880	into an assembly line factory. Again, how would he know he hasn't joined in a single interview?
4888880	4893760	What I do during the interview Steven has never been part of, so for him to just assume that they
4893760	4900240	don't know anything when they come in is a lie. I explain in full detail what they will be doing.
4900800	4906160	I tell them that this isn't an easy job. I tell them that it may take a long time.
4906160	4910960	I tell them that the type of employment is a subcontractor work, which means I pay them
4910960	4916240	poor for the video, not for the amount of time. Contractor job is a real thing,
4916240	4922960	and anyone that knows business would know what I'm talking about. I obviously don't know a lot of
4922960	4928480	different size of different businesses, but it's one of the things that you're allowed to do
4929200	4934800	when you want to hire somebody for a job. Now the pay also depends on the length of the video,
4934800	4940640	the amount of videos that we have some contracted out to, and the quality of the project,
4940640	4948240	because afterwards I try to tip them more than what we pre-agreed on. If they weren't happy with
4948240	4954720	the pay, they can talk to me. Because there has been times where, you know, we would discuss
4955280	4959840	me and an animator, hey, do you think this is good enough? And they tell me, I don't know,
4959840	4964320	do you think it's good enough? And we come to an agreement, and if they aren't happy with it,
4964320	4968480	we can meet somewhere in the middle. Although Daniel claimed that there was no way that Steven
4968480	4973120	would know such details listed in the live stream as incriminating, as we know, Jay on the other
4973120	4977600	hand claimed to have sat in interviews regarding prospective animators with Dan, and made some
4977600	4982080	pretty strong claims himself, likely the ones that may have been repeated in Steven's streams.
4982080	4986720	Steven's comments are likely a case of fired up individuals and Chinese whispers. I think it
4986720	4991280	probably is an exaggerated image, but that's what happens when you try and tackle a subject that
4991280	4996960	you feel strongly about on stream based on other people's comments. Again, I can't show texts or
4996960	5004640	messages, but trust me when I say that I have tried always my best to be considerate to the
5004640	5011440	animators. I've always tried to be kind and gentle and compassionate about their personal lives,
5011440	5016720	and not only that, but be understanding if they're delayed. Doesn't mean I was never
5016720	5023920	frustrated. Anyone who works with anyone are sometimes frustrated, but I tried my best to
5023920	5031520	care for them first before I care about this business or posting a video. When I ask them
5031520	5037360	and they ignore me, I even continue to say and worry about their well-being before the video
5037360	5044880	itself. I ask them how they're doing first before I continue and ask about how the videos are coming
5044880	5052000	along. The only time I would have a conversation about if they're too delayed or if there's
5052000	5058400	something wrong is if there is something seriously wrong or they're months and months late and I have
5058400	5064400	to have a conversation just to see if everything's okay. And even then it's not an aggressive call,
5064400	5070960	I just ask how they're doing and that I understand that personal lives do interfere
5070960	5077520	with finishing on deadlines. This is not because I'm like a great person, it's because I just
5078640	5086080	know what it's like to be on the other side of a relationship when it comes to like a boss figure,
5086080	5092640	I guess, and I didn't want to be one of those people that yelled or intimidated their co-workers
5092640	5100720	or the people they worked with. I at least think, to the best of my knowledge,
5102480	5107920	try to be kind and gentle with the animators. There are two dramatically different perspectives
5107920	5112800	here, but they're not completely incompatible, although they are somewhat. Dan may have been a
5112800	5116560	lovely person to talk to, may have checked in with people about how they were doing, may have
5116560	5120400	been accepting when they were late. That doesn't mean he pays them well, nor does it mean they
5120400	5125040	weren't afraid to speak out due to the possibility of their pay being affected. Admittedly, now the
5125040	5128960	channel has been declared deceased by various people, there isn't really much at stake, so
5128960	5134000	that point is kinda moot. But for the animators who did speak up, what did they actually say?
5134000	5138320	Well, once again, it becomes quite complicated. There was a YouTuber named Snazzle who was quite
5138320	5142160	a vocal critic of Daniel, calling him out left, right and centre for his behaviour.
5142800	5150320	What are you doing, Dan? What are you doing, man? This is disgusting. Please, please come out and
5150320	5155520	say something. Please apologise. Please let people know you can change at least a little, please.
5156080	5162160	There has to be some humanity in you. This can't happen. You have to see now that this is wrong.
5162720	5169600	There has to be some fundamental click going on in your mind that says, hey, this is wrong.
5169600	5173600	I'm doing something wrong. Everyone's telling me I'm doing something wrong, but I'm not seeing it.
5173600	5179840	Why am I not seeing it? Why can't I not see it? Where is that at, Dan? Where's the click? I don't
5179840	5185680	get it from you. None of this makes any sense. How could you be at this right now? How could this
5185680	5191360	level of incompetency happen? How could you be so impudent as to not pay for your staff to get what
5191360	5196320	they need? Those people care so much about your channel, obviously more than you do, and you take
5196320	5202320	all the credit, all the money. That is insane. After Steven streamed and Jay spoke about this
5202320	5206480	narrative, the animator point became more prominent, and Snazzle became more involved.
5206480	5210480	He posted this on Discord, claiming to have spoken to the animators, and it had moved him to the
5210480	5216160	point of tears. Sobering stuff. So what did he do? Well, Snazzle conducted a charity livestream,
5216160	5220960	raising over $4,000 for these animators. A couple of these animators were involved themselves,
5220960	5224240	though I don't think they spoke about the specific drama. I feel if they did,
5224240	5228080	the clips would have been used elsewhere, even though the stream is no longer accessible.
5228080	5232560	Regardless, this was an extraordinary success for the animators and their advocates, but there was
5232560	5237520	more to come. And when I say that, I mean, well, Daniel's video. Dan obviously disputed these claims,
5237520	5241600	showed corresponding evidence, and although he didn't directly respond to the claims made by
5241600	5246560	Snazzle and Jay, his story generally contradicted the image that his treatment of the animators
5246560	5251280	would bring a tear to one's eye. So some became quite confused, and asked questions about the
5251280	5255920	original claims against Daniel. What were the responses? Well...
5255920	5262240	Daniel- As much as I want to explain the situation to people, as much as I know how much, you know,
5263040	5269680	how much people want the information, the information that I have, I just can't do it.
5270720	5277520	I can't sit here and justify giving out that when I know how many people will be hurt,
5277840	5278800	just because I do that.
5278800	5282560	This was frustrating, and it left a lot of people with unanswered questions.
5290240	5294800	Dan's response wasn't the best. There were clear logical flaws, statements that conveyed a rather
5294800	5299280	self-righteous sentiment, arguments that were too irrelevant, and details left out. But after the
5299280	5304400	video, there were very few responses too, and those that were uploaded were very inconclusive.
5304400	5309360	Lest it be reminded, Dan was the only person to provide actual evidence, and that evidence
5309360	5313520	may not have definitively disproved all the narratives against him, but it was enough in
5313520	5314400	certain terms.
5334400	5349520	After some ran such a strong narrative on the basis of the animators, and raising thousands
5349520	5353600	of dollars for them, people wanted to feel like this narrative was actually justified,
5353600	5356880	and the fact that people decided to hold back was understandably frustrating.
5364400	5382080	Some people compared this response to Jeffree Star, and I understand why. It was the sudden
5382080	5386880	decision to end the drama immediately after a conflicting viewpoint and evidence came out,
5386880	5392000	and framing it as the right thing to do. People never liked that, it seems disingenuous. They
5392000	5396720	also don't like being told when it's time to stop the discussion, they'll decide when to stop being
5396720	5400880	interested in it, thank you very much. Snazzle did state he was doing it for the animators,
5400880	5405440	and I do not doubt that many of them probably did want the drama to end, but it's likely worth
5405440	5409680	considering that a bit earlier on in the situation when you're dogmatically preaching over your
5409680	5414000	microphone. I also don't want to dispute that there's a real moralistic case for the disclosure
5414000	5418080	of more information, and justification of the money raised off people who assume the premise
5418080	5423120	to be true, and the handling is definitely subpar, but it is what it is. They raised a lot of money
5423120	5427440	following the end of By The Way, and they did say they would be working with the animators to find
5427440	5432880	them new work, not that the animators need that. However, I'd be lying if I said the situation
5432880	5437360	didn't leave a bitter taste in my mouth given the strength and passion prior, I just hope some
5437360	5440560	people take it as a learning experience going forward.
5440560	5447360	Daniel has essentially trapped any animator who actually wants to make a living just by paying them like slave wages,
5447360	5449760	while still making them work full time.
5449760	5457520	If this was true, I need to be sued. This is not true, and the fact that he said this
5457520	5461680	is a defamation towards not just me, but the company.
5461680	5465520	Now, Daniel does sound a bit silly when he talks about defamation against the company,
5465520	5469520	but equally, these strong sentiments are why people have probably interpreted it with a bit
5469520	5473920	more of an open mind. If Daniel was straight up lying about details, it seems possible to
5473920	5477520	audience members that someone probably would have at least provided factual evidence to the
5477520	5482240	contrary. Now, you can 100% believe the idea that there may be some reasons that these people don't
5482240	5487600	want the drama. These people are not the same as Jeffree Star, and the likes who thrive off it.
5487600	5488640	In the words of Steven,
5488640	5493280	Do I plan on posting another reply video afterwards? No. Once I know that Daniel has seen
5493280	5499920	my stuff, I want to talk to him privately. We're not going to do that, like, avocado person.
5499920	5505040	What do I think? I think it's fair to say the main individuals involved probably didn't want
5505040	5510720	this huge conflict. Steven wanted to be recognised, and Daniel had a reason to reply. Both felt
5510720	5515280	inclined to make public statements for what they believe was just, and although, as noted,
5515280	5519520	certain comments were probably overkill, it's what cynicism does to people. What about other
5519520	5524480	people's motives? Well, I'm not so sure. Jay was another character who had a right to comment in
5524480	5528640	what definitely formed a case against Daniel, and the animator issue was one of the blind spots
5528640	5533360	where Daniel didn't provide any screenshots other than regarding pay. As I noted earlier,
5533360	5537920	the fact that he had no DMs to show whatsoever was pretty unconvincing. On top of this,
5537920	5542880	Jay claimed he had DMs of his own to release, as he felt his credibility was challenged.
5542880	5547120	Again, these DMs never saw the light of day, whether the animators urged him not to as he
5547120	5552000	says in DMs, or if the DMs never existed, is something you'll have to decide for both sides.
5552000	5556000	I personally feel that, because it was the case for both sides, probably meant there was an
5556000	5560880	element of animator reservation, and sometimes silence can be equally as telling as speaking up.
5560880	5564880	People were probably conflicted about their feelings regarding Daniel. Was he nice for the
5564880	5568880	right reasons, or was he just massaging the product? Was he intimidating, or were they
5568880	5574000	intimidated? I doubt you'd see Dan going around spontaneously abusing people, so I assume the
5574000	5578720	evidence was a bit more subtle, and maybe people had cold feet about that. As mentioned, I had also
5578720	5583920	spoken to an animator involved, and that was the impression I received too, a lot of conflicted
5583920	5588880	feelings in spite of criticism. Steven stuck by his guns following the video, though also
5588880	5593040	sticking by his word that he doesn't seek to make another. He's posted a few more statements here
5593040	5597280	and there that have been pretty consistent, mainly about the point regarding animators, and obviously
5597280	5601680	why he wanted to speak about it. It seems that any of Steven's conflicted feelings prior to Dan's
5601680	5606640	video have gone out the window, which I think has disappointed fans further, but in a situation like
5606640	5611360	this, there's no point in faking something that doesn't exist. Jay's video was since removed,
5611360	5615040	and Jay has since deleted his presence from the internet, presumably because of certain
5615040	5619520	allegations surrounding various inappropriate sexual behaviour, including grooming, which
5619520	5624080	I just want to escape at this point. He did post a response, denying these fairly vehemently though,
5624080	5627840	as most of the screenshots and the document that held them are now gone, it's hard for me to really
5627840	5632960	provide a balanced opinion. As a minor caveat, I did find one of the documents. I'm still kinda
5632960	5639040	confused, Jay's been up to some comradery, I'm not sure if it's as incriminating as implied.
5639040	5643120	Regardless, I'll leave them in the reference document in case anyone wants to try and make
5643120	5647920	sense of them. I won't add too much more, other than his exit doesn't appear to have been motivated
5647920	5652960	by the DanPlan situation specifically. Does this compromise his credibility? Not necessarily,
5652960	5656880	unless you feel there's an element of deceit, or similar traits, in his behaviour which may
5656880	5661520	be transferrable. As such, it's hard to comment. Jay's side was just perspective, and although it
5661520	5666320	was important, there are other more important points to take away. When we reflect on DanPlan,
5666320	5670320	there is a significant lack of evidence that answers people's questions. A lot of questions
5670320	5675840	about people's characters and so on, especially the accusations, for example, is Daniel manipulative?
5675840	5681040	Maybe. These DMs that he posted in his own video do seem strangely worded. Amongst other things,
5681040	5686720	one statement that always stuck out to me said, I treated you so much better. This one always rubbed
5686720	5691120	me the wrong way, because who the hell says that if they're not trying to manipulate you? Of course,
5691120	5695520	that's not an argument of positivity, he may just hold himself in higher regard, and it would be
5695920	5700480	transparent, and thus it's not conclusive. But it's a really weird thing to say to someone,
5700480	5704640	even someone whom you have treated well. A lot of other comments, I can see why they would be
5704640	5709280	manipulative, but I can also see why they may not be. You have to ask yourself, could a rational
5709280	5713520	person reply this way? For a lot of the comments, my answer was yes, so you can't jump to the
5713520	5717600	conclusion that someone is malicious just because they say something that could be manipulative.
5717600	5721120	It's true that Daniel could just say certain things in an attempt to butter others up to
5721120	5725280	stop them from speaking out if he knows they might make a video, but it's also something he might say
5725280	5729680	if he genuinely wants to remain friends. It's about how you know Daniel, and I don't know him
5729680	5733680	well enough to make that judgement, though I will provide my opinion very soon. Other questions
5733680	5737680	about contradictions, such as Stephen saying there's a long negotiation phase, and Daniel
5737680	5742880	framing it as if he just came back and accepted $100 per video, seeming conclusive. Some DMs show
5742880	5747280	that Dan was nice to Stephen at points, but what that niceness represents, we cannot be sure.
5747280	5752880	Was Stephen's video the only option? Was other people's treatment at stake? And was it worth it?
5752880	5756960	The truth is, you can't really answer these questions with what we've been given,
5756960	5760240	but I do think there are some things you can take from the situation.
5770400	5774000	One of the more unfair statements that Daniel made in his video was this one.
5774000	5780640	Stephen says that he's worried that they'll be jobless from this. If he really thought this,
5782800	5788480	he would not have made that video when he did, because when he quit we had a conversation,
5788480	5794480	and in the conversation I told him that there's a lot of videos in progress that he is in,
5794480	5800640	and that we're in the progress of making them, so I will be announcing that he is leaving after
5800640	5805360	those videos are posted. This was for the sake of the animators that are working hard to make
5805360	5810800	these videos complete, and he understood that it might take a while. But regardless, he made a
5810800	5818960	video two weeks after he quit, and so now we can't post the videos that he is in. They were all still
5818960	5826000	working in progress, and now they will never see the light of day because of the actions that he
5826000	5831920	took. Of course, I'll be paying the animators full amount that we pre-agreed on, even if they
5831920	5836800	didn't finish the video. It's not their fault. We can't post these videos, and I still want to
5836800	5841600	compensate them with the agreed amount that we made, and I'll ask them if the amount is okay
5841600	5848560	again, and if they're not, then we'll meet somewhere. But that's not the important part.
5848560	5855200	The important part is that what they made will never see the light of day because Stephen decided
5855200	5861360	to make the video so quickly, even though he knew we were still in progress of making
5861360	5862880	many videos that he was in.
5862880	5867600	Now, this is pretty unreasonable considering Stephen stated that he doesn't mind any videos with
5867600	5872560	him being published after his exit. Although I understand why you may not want to release
5872560	5876560	previous videos with someone you have bad blood with, that is ultimately your decision as much
5876560	5881760	as his was to release the video. It's a shared responsibility. Daniel also does a fair bit of
5881760	5886160	paraphrasing here, and if you look at the DMs, all it really shows is Stephen saying he wants
5886160	5891280	the videos out as soon as possible rather than having them spaced out, even though he also says
5891280	5895440	he's okay with them being published. I think Stephen made his point pretty clear in the
5895440	5900080	messages, and Daniel's interpretation is rather uncharitable. The tone it's done in is pretty
5900080	5904800	incendiary, and it seems like he's looking for an excuse to end the series there. This didn't have
5904800	5910320	to be the series ending video. Dan chose to make this video series ending. It wouldn't have been
5910400	5915120	difficult to make a video saying, I'm sorry, I got some things wrong, I probably did underestimate
5915120	5919360	the efforts of those around me, but I do feel that people have got my intent wrong, and I'm gonna do
5919360	5923760	better to prove it. The DanPlan audience would have been more than happy with a video like that,
5923760	5929520	they wanted this situation to heal. Dan chose to kamikaze it by making an equal amount of character
5929520	5933760	indicting statements against Stephen. Does that mean he's guilty? Not at all, he may just be
5933760	5939600	defending his pride. But pride comes at a cost, and Dan decides to pay the price, and hell, he can
5939600	5943280	probably afford it. The amount of money that an audience friendly animation channel will make
5943280	5948160	from ad revenue alone is monumental, and then you consider merch and sponsorships, it'll be
5948160	5952720	ridiculous. On the other hand, YouTube can be unpredictable, and having all your eggs in that
5952720	5957120	basket would probably make you a bit more frugal than some careers would. I understand that,
5957120	5962000	and I wanted to empathise with him on the basis of the fact that running a team costing and being
5962000	5966320	consistent can be a challenge, but at the same time, his self-superior attitude towards it is
5966320	5971280	if it's some monumental undertaking that suddenly entitles him to such a mammoth share of the
5971280	5974800	channel, it's something that I couldn't personally connect with. It doesn't help that one of the
5974800	5979280	other allegations was that he paid some of the manual work a surprisingly low amount.
5979280	5981440	It was contradictory logic to many people.
5981440	5985840	It's not true. Ever since the company was made at the beginning of last year,
5986560	5992480	I have taken zero dollars from the company. This doesn't mean I haven't taken money from the past
5992480	5996880	before the company was made. It doesn't mean I won't take money out from the company in the
5996880	6003840	future. But I was more invested and reinvesting into the channel and the community, and I was more
6003840	6013040	focused on putting the money there. But clearly, it seems like now that I just take all the money
6013040	6014720	and run away with it."
6014720	6018960	Besides the rather pointless nature of that statement, it doesn't change the fact that
6018960	6024080	how much he paid himself wasn't the problem. He could donate it all to charity, and it wouldn't
6024080	6029840	change the point. It's proportionately how much was made and how much other people who contributed
6029840	6035680	a significant amount to the channel brand saw. Now, regardless of how ridiculous I would consider
6035680	6041600	it, I mean, a hundred dollars a video for someone in that position is unbelievable. If both parties
6041600	6046720	agree to it, force aside, most people will say that's responsibility taken on by both sides.
6046720	6051040	So obviously, there is the question regarding how much negotiation took place, and there's very
6051040	6055040	little evidence shown. But regardless of the claims, it makes sense to me that Steven probably
6055040	6060560	ended up settling for less due to a motive outside of that which is financial. Daniel is very careful
6060560	6065040	in each of his statements, and I don't doubt that he probably has negotiated with artists from time
6065040	6069120	to time and come to an agreement, but it doesn't seem implausible that Hosuh may have argued
6069120	6074000	generally with Daniel regarding payments and wages too, and I find the use of legality as a reason
6074000	6078560	not to discuss such to be rather unconvincing. I do receive the impression that Daniel is quite
6078560	6082800	headstrong, and I think the fact that he never really recognised the sheer imbalance in that pay
6082800	6088080	is a testament to it. If you consider someone more than an employee, then pay them like one. He was
6088080	6093120	essentially a contracted guest, and that gave him no loyalty. Daniel was motivated to keep the
6093120	6098080	channel structured as it was. I think he did have a bias towards people he viewed as quote originals,
6098080	6102720	especially if he gave Hosuh a cut against the dude's own will. He was stubborn, and I wouldn't
6102720	6107200	doubt that when confronted, he used the power of his authority to appeal to his sense of business,
6107200	6112320	and knowing what's best, which is where this shoutout fan-off style idea came from, maybe from
6112320	6117760	the good old gaming days. I don't think Dan uses these ideas to insult people as Jay felt. I
6117760	6122160	received the impression it was likely a legitimate passion that he had tunnel vision about. I don't
6122160	6126720	think Dan had menacing intentions, he just thought he knew what was best because he was the channel
6126720	6131520	owner, and the channel was his, but he failed to realise that the By The Way series brought Stephen
6131520	6136000	into the picture, and no amount of side videos, almost all of which underperformed, could really
6136000	6142560	change that. Stephen isn't business minded, I think he just wanted some more credit, in whatever form.
6142560	6147200	Now, there are nuances to this dispute, given it was rooted in a confrontation that both sides
6147200	6151280	framed quite differently, and we know it was a volatile argument, and we can say things in the
6151280	6156160	heat of the moment. Daniel did apologise for his rage very shortly after it, but the resolution
6156160	6160960	was clearly not the end, no deal can help you move past something like that. Daniel may have viewed
6160960	6165040	his outburst as a moment of frustration, but Stephen saw it as the slipping of a long war
6165040	6170320	masquerade, comments that remain stuck in his head for months to come. By the time he left the channel,
6170320	6174960	he had grown bitter, to the extent that he wanted to make Daniel pay, he wanted to be heard, and he
6174960	6178800	clearly didn't think he could be heard from the inside. Should he have brought it up with Daniel
6178800	6185360	prior? Maybe if he cared about Daniel knowing, but at that point he didn't. Stephen wanted first blood,
6185440	6186480	and he got it.
6186480	6191840	Stephen- Do I think me and Dan will be friends? Do I have any intentions on being friends again?
6193680	6198240	No. I've burned this bridge and I don't intend to rebuild it.
6198240	6202320	Now, at this point, Stephen can't really put on the I reached out to Daniel narrative, because he
6202320	6206320	can't expect to be treated any differently to how he treated Daniel. There's no honour amongst
6206320	6210400	thieves, but before we could even have that discussion, Jay's video left a further dent
6210400	6214960	in the already tarnished reputation, it fit in thematically with Stephen's narrative, and provided
6214960	6219520	even more detail, some of which would be confirmed by Dan's own video a few days later,
6219520	6223920	some of which would be contradicted. Dan's video may have originally been an emotional tell all
6223920	6228560	of one side, but by the time the second stream came out, it became a case of who was going to
6228560	6233760	scorch the most earth. Daniel's video may have rationalised his perspective, but there was little
6233760	6238160	closure, even with the evidence and screenshots, you receive the impression that these two cowboys
6238160	6242960	were riding on different wavelengths, and you may find yourself on either. If you are more of a
6242960	6247520	classical liberal, you may well have sided with Dan. To some people, I'm sure Dan's deals were
6247520	6252240	just business, whether he was a dick to people or not, people consented, and he was part of the
6252240	6257440	market, even if the market was flawed, yet you could be the most Machiavellian mortal in existence,
6257440	6262960	and still acknowledge that Dan ultimately failed, because he torpedoed his own flagship series in
6262960	6269040	the name of pride. The image of Dan Plan was based on something inherently antithetical to how the
6269040	6274560	drum portrayed it. A channel always will have some underlying business elements, but if fraternity
6274560	6279760	is a selling point, then these videos were just not compatible with it. Dan recently revamped the
6279760	6284240	channel to pursue a new direction, one that I think he is more comfortable with, and will probably
6284240	6288640	reflect his interests a little more. I wish him the best with that, and maybe he did truly see
6288640	6293360	opportunity within the destruction, but as many other creators have found, it is often hard to
6293360	6298160	rebrand with an audience who have come to expect something, so I would manage expectations over the
6298160	6303280	coming months, and focus on making content that you enjoy, regardless of what other people say.
6303280	6306000	Don't go out of your way to justify yourself.
6306000	6310960	I'm at a state where I have to explain myself for wanting to charity, because I'm so worried that
6310960	6315120	people are just going to be like, oh, anything he does now, he's just doing it for his... No,
6315120	6320720	I've been doing charity before this drama happened, and I will continue to do charity after this
6320720	6326720	drama happened. I don't care what you think of me, alright? This doesn't fix anything. If I was a bad
6326720	6332960	person, I am a bad person. If I was a good person, I am a good person. Doing a charity is only good
6332960	6335760	because you're doing a charity, everybody should be doing charity. If you can't afford it, don't
6335760	6341200	donate, okay? You should protect yourself first, obviously. But if you can afford it, help each other out.
6341200	6346320	Two sides hellbent on burning each other down, what we left with? Well, the neutral parties, and they
6346320	6350880	told their own story too. We already spoke about the animators who were mostly silent, and reticent
6350880	6355600	about releasing any DMs which support either cause. But what about the friends, the amigos?
6355600	6359520	What have they said? Well, one of the original members by the name of Anna released a stream
6359520	6364480	stating her perspective. I'd say it leans towards Dan's side, and of course, there is a limit within
6364480	6369280	that perspective. She definitely sighs towards his corner. If my video doesn't satisfy on its own,
6369280	6371440	I'd recommend checking hers out.
6371440	6379440	I think his intentions were good, but I think it was a little flawed if you look at it in an overall
6379440	6385040	perspective. His intentions weren't bad at all, like I don't think Daniel's intentions were to like,
6385040	6390000	oh yeah, I'm just gonna give money to everybody else, and like, not to like my own friends or
6390000	6396880	whatever. Like, I think his intentions were good, but I think he had to see the overall picture of
6396880	6401840	what was going on. And what about Hosuh, the fellow founding member of DanPlan who'd been there
6401840	6407600	through the highs and lows? What did he say? Well, he hasn't made any official statements,
6407600	6412480	any videos, released any DMs, but he has been streaming a fair bit with Steven, and even sought
6412480	6413920	to make this comment.
6413920	6421360	Back in high school, Daniel was like, a really good guy. I respected him, he was great. He knew
6423520	6429200	how to get along with people, but now he has somewhat changed.
6429840	6431840	Okay, maybe that's enough.
6431840	6432320	That's good.
6432320	6434240	So people change, right?
6434240	6434800	Yeah.
6434800	6435040	Okay.
6435040	6440880	People change, and depending on the circumstances and the factors, I could not foresee it. Like,
6440880	6441760	people change.
6441760	6444800	What that means exactly, I'll let you decide.
6444800	6449120	Another one of my friends, DarthPina, also made a video on the topic that will be linked in the
6449120	6453440	pinned comment below, which integrates interviews with some fresh perspective. I definitely
6453440	6458320	recommend checking his take out if you have the chance. In the end, both sides have said their
6458320	6463120	part, and we shouldn't expect more, but we can always do our best to understand.
6463120	6467920	It does seem like a divorce, with the channel being torn between two rather determined figures,
6468000	6472560	and although some people may take a strong side, a lot of people just seem confused and
6472560	6477760	forlorn, with many coming back to these videos to pay their respects like a YouTube gravestone.
6477760	6482800	It's sad that some people are just waiting for DanPlan to turn around and say it was a huge prank,
6482800	6487200	because that's the degree that their perception was shattered. It's phenomenal.
6487200	6491360	I'd say this topic reminded me of my Spill video, in a way, when I spoke about the corporatisation
6491360	6496240	of YouTube. In that upload, I noted that once you give the voice of a channel a personality,
6496240	6501520	people become connected to that as a brand, and that voice has much more power in the future of
6501520	6506080	the channel as the owner. Today's situation, although not identical, was a test of that,
6506080	6510960	and regardless of who you side with, audience sentiment was clear. Steven established his
6510960	6515440	character, and once people began to associate the characteristics with the name, the association
6515440	6519920	reversed, and people came back not just for the jokes or the banter, but for Steven, as much as
6519920	6524960	they came back for Hosuh or Daniel, and that sentiment echoed throughout the drama. He wasn't
6524960	6529680	just a member, he was the member, and the scale of this drama is a testament to that.
6530320	6534800	DanPlan was a channel which was the passion project of its titular creators, a channel that
6534800	6539440	brought joy unto many people, and found great success thanks to its dynamic concepts and
6539440	6545680	energetic interplay between its hosts. It's BTW series, in a way, became synonymous with DanPlan.
6545680	6551280	If BTW went down, DanPlan was going to face a real challenge in its continuation, and with this new
6551280	6556880	era, it seems Dan is attempting to reinvent the brand, but with the legacy of BTW engraved in
6556880	6560640	its identity, one thing is for certain, DanPlan will never be the same.
6563840	6570400	I'd first of all like to give a thanks to a creator who I really have come to like, by the
6570400	6575280	name of Antoine. I caught one of his videos on DanPlan, and I reached out to him, and he was
6575360	6581520	really helpful, and provided me with a resource that I wouldn't have been able to use otherwise
6581520	6587920	to make this video. So, a massive thank you to Antoine, go check out his channel, he's not making
6587920	6593920	too many videos right now, but go and send him some love and appreciation, I think he's got a
6593920	6601120	really good head on his shoulders, and very nice technical style. I have nothing too much else to
6601120	6605680	say about it, just go and check him out, send him some appreciation, thank you man.
6631120	6635920	Work in the grind, much respect to them, keep up the great work. I would also like to thank my
6635920	6640080	patreons, my $10 patreons plus will be up on the screen right now. I want to give a big thanks to my
6640080	6647760	$50 patreons, we have Amanda, we have Caroline, we have Hypercube, and we have some hullabaloo,
6647760	6653120	thank you so much for your support, it means a lot. And we also have to give a big thanks to my $100
6653120	6660480	patreons, and that is Brandon Junck, Christopher Koras, and Yesenia Ramirez. Thank you so much for
6660480	6666000	your support guys, it means the world to me. If you wanna reach me, Twitter, but I've been quite busy
6666000	6670720	recently, and obviously you can join my Discord, I must give you a warning, I haven't been using my
6670720	6676480	Facebook recently, so there's my warning. I don't really have too much else to add, hang in there
6676480	6680000	guys, I'm sending my love. Keep up the hustle my friends.
