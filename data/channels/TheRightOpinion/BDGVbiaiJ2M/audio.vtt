Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time,

00:11.360 --> 00:16.400
and YouTube drama comes in many different forms. In the last few months, a lot of my videos have focused on these

00:16.400 --> 00:22.320
situations that have spanned over years, and although a drama may reach its peak in a way that catches people off guard,

00:22.320 --> 00:28.400
if you look at the history, normally you'll see a pattern of conflict and attention from other commentators that has contributed to

00:28.480 --> 00:34.160
a climax of sorts. However, drama can often be even more shocking when it happens out of nowhere, when people think that

00:34.160 --> 00:40.400
actually a certain channel may be the last place to end up spiralling so dramatically, and that's what appeared to be the case

00:40.400 --> 00:43.760
with today's subject, the channel named Danplan.

00:43.760 --> 00:59.600
Now, when a lot of people reached out to me about this situation, I will admit, I was not familiar with Danplan,

00:59.600 --> 01:05.360
and in spite of their approximately 2 million strong fanbase, many of my friends were not familiar with their content either,

01:05.360 --> 01:10.800
so I sat down and watched a lot of Danplan, and tried to immerse myself in their content.

01:10.800 --> 01:17.200
Now I think I have a decent grasp, I will briefly summarise their origins and style, so people have a grip on how they

01:17.200 --> 01:23.920
created such a significant following. Danplan as a channel was established in July 2014 by their titular creators,

01:23.920 --> 01:31.760
Daniel and his friend Hosuh, with the first upload coming soon after, delightfully named, by the way, Moral of the Pooping Robber.

01:31.760 --> 01:38.160
And I know, I know, I know what you're thinking, you're thinking, why is Joe fighting a dude with a weapon?

01:38.160 --> 01:44.640
Wait, wait, wait, I can do better, I can do better. Why is Joe fighting a dude with a weapon?

01:44.640 --> 01:51.120
But you have to realise that Joe is extremely strong, even today when he slaps me in the back to say hi in a friendly manner,

01:51.120 --> 01:53.840
it feels like this.

01:56.240 --> 02:01.280
This was the first instalment of their By The Way series, and this video consisted of a rather crudely drawn

02:01.280 --> 02:07.120
character discussing a story told by his youth pastor, in which this pastor encountered a series of burglaries

02:07.120 --> 02:13.120
conducted by a robber who defecated following each incident. Now the audio could be a tad better, and this video

02:13.120 --> 02:18.160
only appears to include Dan's commentary, but you can definitely see the origins of a great channel in the making,

02:18.160 --> 02:23.840
a lot of Hosuh's creative illustrations enhance Dan's stories on a comedic basis, and Dan's outgoing nature

02:23.840 --> 02:27.760
makes him an effective storyteller, there was definitely potential here.

02:27.840 --> 02:33.920
However, this series wouldn't receive much attention following its initial upload, animation was in a bit of a lull at that point,

02:33.920 --> 02:39.360
Daniel and Hosuh were busy people, and thus it was probably not worth putting too many eggs in that basket.

02:39.360 --> 02:45.440
After this, Dan Plan spent just under a couple years dedicated to gaming content, which was much more popular at the time.

02:45.440 --> 02:49.760
These gaming videos weren't the most unique, though they were often presented more like highlight reels,

02:49.760 --> 02:54.480
and used character heads to represent different people talking, and to try and give it a unique energy.

02:54.480 --> 03:01.440
Dan was the consistent host of these videos, gaming with a varying roster of guests such as Anna, Billie, Jay, and of course, Hosuh.

03:01.440 --> 03:06.400
However, there was one more character to introduce to the story, that person goes by the name of Steven.

03:06.400 --> 03:35.360
Steven was introduced on the 5th of September 2015, in the upload Yamate, Titan Senpai,

03:35.360 --> 03:39.600
in which he and of course Dan and Hosuh play the Attack on Titan tribute game.

03:39.600 --> 03:43.440
Like Hosuh and many of their other friends, they were acquainted through school and college,

03:43.440 --> 03:48.960
and for these comrades, this was just a regular gaming session which happened to be uploaded onto YouTube.

03:48.960 --> 03:55.680
Steven was not one of the original members, but he quickly became a recurring guest on the channel as other individuals began to appear less.

03:55.680 --> 04:03.520
However, these gaming videos, although enjoyable for those who participated, didn't set the channel on fire, gaining Dan Plan only 50 subscribers.

04:03.520 --> 04:09.600
So come May 2016, the By the Way series was resumed, but this time with a slightly different format.

04:09.600 --> 04:12.480
Daniel- Alright, let me tell you a story about the time when my final exams ended.

04:12.480 --> 04:15.200
Steven- Wait, wait, wait. Daniel- So, why are you telling you a story?

04:15.200 --> 04:20.000
In this video, Daniel tries to tell a story, but is occasionally interrupted by his friends.

04:20.000 --> 04:25.680
Initially requesting justification for the change in direction, and then reacting to his outlandish story regarding the time,

04:25.680 --> 04:28.880
he discovered a variety of condoms under a person's bed.

04:28.880 --> 04:34.720
It was a rough idea of what he had planned for these videos, and over the next few uploads he would continue to refine this brand.

04:34.720 --> 04:39.680
In his By the Way Would You Rather, he incorporates his friends, providing them with a more prominent role.

04:39.680 --> 04:44.480
In this instance, the friends were Hosuh and Jay, another person who regularly appeared on the channel.

04:44.480 --> 04:51.840
By the next video, however, the person appearing alongside Dan and Hosuh was Steven, and he became the principal third contributor to this content.

04:51.840 --> 04:56.960
Now, as any creator knows, these videos will not take off immediately, at least most videos won't.

04:56.960 --> 05:01.440
However, within the year they had their first hit, By the Way, Are You A Psychopath?

05:01.440 --> 05:07.920
Now, it's quite easy to work out why this video did well, it's a punchy title, it's a popular topic, and it's a striking thumbnail,

05:07.920 --> 05:10.480
and they probably had some pretty impressive watch time too.

05:10.480 --> 05:15.920
At this point, animation videos had begun to pick up significant traction, so there was really no better time to blow up,

05:15.920 --> 05:18.960
and over the months and years following, they would do just that.

05:18.960 --> 05:40.080
Like their psychopath video, a lot of their content integrated anecdotal style games,

05:40.080 --> 05:44.000
which would often present a challenge and ask the participants to make a decision,

05:44.000 --> 05:47.120
which would then lead to various consequences and banter alike.

05:47.120 --> 05:54.640
It's engaging to watch and often quite interactive, I would find myself pausing the videos to see if I could work out these questions or mysteries myself,

05:54.640 --> 05:57.520
and as their channel grew, their chemistry seemed to develop as well.

06:14.000 --> 06:26.560
And thus they established their brand, Daniel, Hosuh, and Steven.

06:26.560 --> 06:29.840
By the way, but more importantly, DanPlan.

06:29.840 --> 06:34.080
Their content had mass appeal, the topics were timeless, with great rewatch value,

06:34.080 --> 06:39.600
and there was a legitimate chemistry that was rooted in a transcendent bond thanks to organic friendships

06:39.600 --> 06:42.880
that one cannot simply cultivate for mere business purposes.

06:42.880 --> 06:47.600
What could possibly go wrong? Well, a lot.

06:47.600 --> 06:50.800
Hey guys. Sorry, but there won't be a stream this week.

06:51.600 --> 06:56.960
But I did want to give you guys an explanation about me and DanPlan and just the future of this channel.

06:57.600 --> 07:00.960
So as the title of the video says, I've quit DanPlan.

07:03.520 --> 07:09.440
Join me today as we analyze DanPlan, what exactly went down, what exactly people said, what exactly went wrong,

07:09.440 --> 07:11.760
and if there's any way to write it.

07:11.760 --> 07:17.440
And maybe if I'm feeling a bit charitable, I'll garnish this spicy dish with a few right opinions here and there.

07:17.440 --> 07:20.800
I want to also clarify that due to the chronological order of this drama,

07:20.800 --> 07:23.040
I'll be going over one side before the other.

07:23.040 --> 07:27.360
So if it looks unfavourable towards an individual, sit tight, we'll get there.

07:27.360 --> 07:30.000
Without further ado, I suggest we dive right in.

07:30.000 --> 07:41.440
As said, the three people central to the DanPlan channel were Daniel, Hosuh, and Steven.

07:41.440 --> 07:45.440
Over the years, they established a reputation that was essential to the brand they were creating,

07:45.440 --> 07:47.760
as a collective, and as individuals.

07:47.760 --> 07:54.640
By the way, it became a primary brand, and it often became interchangeable with the DanPlan channel for many audience members.

07:54.640 --> 07:57.440
Within DanPlan, these characters had their appeal.

07:57.440 --> 08:02.720
Dan as the strong anchor for the content and direction of discussion, Hosuh as the precious spirit of innocence,

08:02.720 --> 08:05.920
and Steven as the slightly darker, more twisted Geezer.

08:05.920 --> 08:08.000
Geezer- Can I just leave the country?

08:08.000 --> 08:10.480
Steven- No leaving the country, that's too easy.

08:10.480 --> 08:11.360
Geezer- Too easy.

08:11.360 --> 08:14.880
Hosuh- I think I'd go to school.

08:14.880 --> 08:16.800
Steven- Well, I mean, I can f*** up schools too.

08:16.800 --> 08:19.600
Geezer- It's not just in America, not just in America!

08:19.600 --> 08:23.120
Geezer- I can say that in public, so I won't take that out.

08:23.120 --> 08:26.240
Steven- It's the purge, okay? It's on the purge.

08:26.240 --> 08:29.360
With this in mind, even though the channel was owned by Dan and Hosuh,

08:29.360 --> 08:32.000
it gave many viewers the impression it was a mutual venture.

08:32.000 --> 08:35.440
There were a couple videos which deviated from the By The Way style,

08:35.440 --> 08:37.840
and those were probably more restricted to Dan and Hosuh,

08:37.840 --> 08:41.760
but as many people tended to conflate the By The Way series with the DanPlan channel,

08:41.760 --> 08:45.920
it would be easy to receive the impression that they all had a somewhat similar stake.

08:45.920 --> 08:49.840
2019 was an incredibly successful year for the DanPlan squad.

08:49.840 --> 08:52.880
They hit 1 million subscribers, they hit 2 million subscribers,

08:52.880 --> 08:55.440
they released a ton of merch, launched a Discord server,

08:55.440 --> 08:59.440
there was a lot to celebrate, but come 2020, it would all change.

09:00.080 --> 09:05.360
On January the 4th, DanPlan released a video called By The Way, Can You Become a Superhero?

09:05.360 --> 09:07.440
The video is fairly routine.

09:07.440 --> 09:10.640
Dan- Steven, you've seen to the future, a person's about to get hit by the bus.

09:10.640 --> 09:13.200
Three, f*** the tires of the bus.

09:13.200 --> 09:17.200
Geezer- The tires of the bus hits, the bus rolls, f*** 20 people inside.

09:17.200 --> 09:18.960
Geezer- Oh my god, man!

09:18.960 --> 09:24.240
Dan- Save the elderly, that was my objective, saving the elderly, that's all that matters.

09:24.240 --> 09:28.160
Unsuspecting Dan fans, hehe, didn't notice much.

09:28.160 --> 09:33.040
However, the video was ominously labelled Final Episode, and judging by the shock of many people

09:33.040 --> 09:37.040
in light of what happened next, gives me the impression that people assumed the subtitle

09:37.040 --> 09:41.520
didn't mean the end of DanPlan's series, but more the end of the two parts which they had titled

09:41.520 --> 09:42.720
in such a way before.

09:42.720 --> 09:48.080
However, less than 5 hours later, Steven, a third of By The Way, formally announced in a video

09:48.080 --> 09:50.720
that he was going to be departing DanPlan.

09:50.800 --> 09:55.840
Now, that's obviously shocking for many reasons, but people leave shows, people leave groups,

09:55.840 --> 09:58.320
people move on, that's what you expect.

09:58.320 --> 10:02.880
What people didn't expect was the explanation, normally you have some quaintly written letter

10:02.880 --> 10:06.720
thanking people for the good times and memories, and I'm not doubting that Steven didn't have

10:06.720 --> 10:11.840
some of his own, but they were not the focus of this video, he had a greater issue to discuss.

10:12.400 --> 10:18.720
This isn't gonna be a Daniel exposed video, but I did want you all to know about how this all started.

10:18.800 --> 10:20.080
Daniel himself.

10:20.080 --> 10:21.760
Let's break the video down.

10:21.760 --> 10:26.400
Announcing that he had formally left in mid-December, Steven takes us back to the start, and breaks

10:26.400 --> 10:27.760
down his role on the channel.

10:27.760 --> 10:31.680
I have already explained a fair bit of this, but Steven emphasises that he was not part

10:31.680 --> 10:36.480
of the channel at first, and he only became involved when Hosuh proposed a third member,

10:36.480 --> 10:41.280
which became particularly integral when DanPlan transitioned from gaming to more character-driven

10:41.280 --> 10:42.800
animation videos.

10:42.800 --> 10:48.560
Our unique theme and on-camera personalities meshed so well, and that's probably why we

10:48.560 --> 10:50.880
got so popular so fast.

10:50.880 --> 10:56.080
The three of us and our dynamic was just remarkable, and the way we float off of each other is still

10:56.080 --> 10:58.000
something that amazes me looking back.

10:58.000 --> 11:02.480
Then he talks about their success, and how their dynamic concept and delivery all contributed

11:02.480 --> 11:02.960
to it.

11:02.960 --> 11:06.080
He talks about the scale of the success and his own reaction.

11:06.080 --> 11:10.000
Nonetheless, he has never considered it more than a hobby, him establishing a role in the

11:10.000 --> 11:14.800
success and how he has perceived it sets up his next point, which would be the treatment

11:14.800 --> 11:16.800
and credit that he has received.

11:16.800 --> 11:20.640
It's no secret that I've never thought of YouTube as anything other than a hobby.

11:21.200 --> 11:26.640
Even now with Actually Steven, I still don't consider it a job, but Daniel did, which brings

11:26.640 --> 11:30.080
me to this year, and why friends and business don't mix.

11:30.080 --> 11:34.480
This is where the first issue comes in, as a main voice on the channel, and someone who

11:34.480 --> 11:38.960
was involved in the presentation, he felt proportionally he deserved more than he was

11:38.960 --> 11:40.240
receiving from Danplan.

11:40.240 --> 11:44.560
He accepts that he's not quite as involved, but in the month where he states the Chow

11:44.560 --> 11:49.520
was making five figures, he had only received a total of $225.

11:49.520 --> 11:54.960
We can assume this occurred around early 2019, as he stated the upcoming instant due to this

11:54.960 --> 11:57.760
happened around nine months prior to him quitting in December.

11:57.760 --> 12:01.440
Now, to receive such a meager wage in return felt insulting to him.

12:01.440 --> 12:05.760
However, for many, a problem like this between friends wouldn't be publicised unless he had

12:05.760 --> 12:08.160
attempted to find a compromise himself.

12:08.160 --> 12:12.240
Unfortunately, this attempted resolution led to a very angry two-day dispute between

12:12.240 --> 12:16.560
Daniel and Steven, in which Steven requested a 20% share of the channel.

12:16.560 --> 12:21.200
Daniel not only rejected this proposal, but the dispute resulted in what many view as

12:21.200 --> 12:23.200
Daniel's most objectionable statements.

12:24.000 --> 12:28.320
So me and Daniel argued for hours over the course of two days.

12:29.440 --> 12:34.320
But then I asked Daniel, what could I do to increase my share in Danplan?

12:35.040 --> 12:36.720
And everything just imploded.

12:37.440 --> 12:40.800
He said nothing, you're just an employee, you have no share.

12:41.520 --> 12:45.520
And that statement has stuck with me ever since we fought, and it hasn't gone away.

12:46.080 --> 12:50.560
At this point, Steven proceeds to directly respond to the statement, once again re-emphasising

12:50.560 --> 12:54.480
his contribution, and then contrasting it with Daniel's statement, to highlight its

12:54.480 --> 12:55.680
disrespectful nature.

12:55.680 --> 13:00.080
He then proceeds to say at that point he planned on quitting, but wanted to stay due to multiple

13:00.080 --> 13:03.840
reasons, including Hosuh's attempt to resolve the strained relationships, the fact that

13:03.840 --> 13:08.080
Steven enjoyed the fame and attention, but primarily because he wanted to prove himself

13:08.080 --> 13:11.440
worthy of having more of a share, more of a position on the channel.

13:11.440 --> 13:15.360
However, the more he vied for that approval, the more he came to the realisation that it

13:15.360 --> 13:16.880
was ultimately unattainable.

13:16.880 --> 13:20.000
And so, for the past nine months, I tried.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.240
God knows I tried.

13:22.240 --> 13:26.480
Every recording session, I brought my humour, my edge to the table.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.280
But I fought a losing battle.

13:29.280 --> 13:37.200
The more effort I put into developing my character, developing Steven, I realised how

13:37.200 --> 13:38.640
little Daniel valued it.

13:39.600 --> 13:45.200
Formal Mafia Steven, Huggy Zombie Apocalypse Steven, Mmm Hosuh Steven.

13:45.200 --> 13:49.840
Daniel didn't give me a script to do those characters, I made them up, and I made my

13:49.840 --> 13:51.680
personalities enjoyable.

13:51.680 --> 13:56.000
But to Daniel, every recording session, I was merely talking to friends.

13:56.000 --> 13:59.120
To him, I wasn't putting in any effort into the videos.

13:59.680 --> 14:04.720
Every recording session, I wanted to swear at Daniel for real, to yell at him so much

14:04.720 --> 14:08.800
that I had to stop talking sometimes or else I might say something I would regret the next

14:08.800 --> 14:09.040
day.

14:11.040 --> 14:16.080
And that feeling only grew each session until the last recording in November that we did,

14:17.120 --> 14:20.560
where I finally just zoned out and stopped trying at all.

14:21.280 --> 14:26.800
Nine months ago, when we argued, I asked Dan how many views on our videos were garnered

14:26.800 --> 14:27.200
by me.

14:27.840 --> 14:29.360
He said he didn't have an answer.

14:30.400 --> 14:35.760
A few weeks ago, I asked him the same question again, and his answer didn't change.

14:37.360 --> 14:43.760
So I know that no matter how hard I try, no matter how many personalities I perfect,

14:43.760 --> 14:46.480
Daniel will never consider me an equal on the channel.

14:47.040 --> 14:48.160
So I quit.

14:48.160 --> 14:52.080
Stephen ends with some rather somber messages, stating that people should know their own

14:52.080 --> 14:56.080
worth on the channel because Daniel won't recognise it otherwise, and that ultimately

14:56.080 --> 15:00.480
he regrets being a part of DanPlan, because he still believes he'd call Dan a friend if

15:00.480 --> 15:03.280
he'd not involved himself with the channel in the first place.

15:03.280 --> 15:03.680
Sad.

15:04.240 --> 15:08.080
There are a lot of messages to break down within this video, but we can't say too much

15:08.080 --> 15:12.560
currently, as there are still many more perspectives to analyse, and conflicting points of view.

15:12.560 --> 15:16.640
What I will say is that in light of this video, a majority of people believed him, but they

15:16.640 --> 15:19.040
weren't necessarily hostile towards Daniel.

15:19.040 --> 15:22.800
They more passed on the message that as it stood, they were upset with him, but would

15:22.800 --> 15:24.560
like to hear his side nonetheless.

15:24.560 --> 15:28.320
However, before that could happen, there were a few more hammers to fall, and we'll get

15:28.320 --> 15:29.360
into that right now.

15:35.440 --> 15:39.840
Approximately a week after his video, Stephen conducted a two-hour stream, which obviously

15:39.840 --> 15:43.040
made me very happy, as it was more material for me to sit through.

15:43.040 --> 15:44.000
Thank you, Stephen.

15:44.000 --> 15:47.520
But jokes aside, there are some key details here, even if you have to sift through a lot

15:47.520 --> 15:52.160
of the casual discussion, though I am going to be reserving some details for later discourse.

15:52.160 --> 15:56.560
Now, at this point, Daniel had not responded yet, and had not replied to any of Stephen's

15:56.560 --> 16:00.800
messages seeking resolution, leading to a significant amount of frustration.

16:00.800 --> 16:04.880
Stephen felt uncertain as to Dan's state, so had decided to proceed with this live stream

16:04.880 --> 16:08.160
where he talks more about the conditions surrounding the situation.

16:08.160 --> 16:13.040
Let me preface this entire stream by saying, I have reached out to Daniel.

16:14.080 --> 16:20.800
I talked- I tried to talk to him yesterday, just so I can give him some time between getting

16:20.800 --> 16:27.600
like all this drama dropped on him, and then like him actually wanting to talk to me.

16:28.560 --> 16:33.680
So I tried to give him like at least some time, and in that time, I was hoping that

16:33.680 --> 16:40.160
he would post something, or at least try to dispel the things I said in my video.

16:40.880 --> 16:47.360
But it's just been total silence from him, and I'm not sure what else to do at this point.

16:48.160 --> 16:53.120
So I'll just give my side of the story, and if it somehow overlaps with his,

16:54.560 --> 16:59.280
feel free to, I guess, disprove them, Daniel.

16:59.840 --> 17:03.680
There's a lot to digest here, and I would obviously recommend watching it yourself,

17:03.680 --> 17:07.920
if you're truly interested in what he said. A lot of it is relating to feelings that he's had

17:07.920 --> 17:12.320
following the video, how he's coping, what he's planning to do when Dan responds, and so on,

17:12.320 --> 17:16.000
and a few more personal questions, such as whether he believed YouTube changed Dan,

17:16.000 --> 17:20.960
of which you can probably guess Stephen's answer. However, there are a few interesting points here,

17:20.960 --> 17:25.680
the first one was regarding pay. According to Stephen, poster as co-owner was originally being

17:25.680 --> 17:30.880
paid on a 50-50 split with Dan, however, at some point in 2017, the split was altered,

17:30.880 --> 17:35.520
so that Dan received 85% to Hosuh's 15. Quite the change.

17:56.240 --> 18:03.440
and then just paid out whoever with the 100%, which is insane to me. Hosuh probably has reasons

18:03.440 --> 18:08.640
for it, but it was just insane that I heard that. And then I asked him, hey Hosuh, how much

18:08.640 --> 18:18.400
have you been paid? And he said, 28,000. Okay, so let's assume that 28,000 is 15% of the total

18:18.400 --> 18:24.720
revenue, not even just like gross, like the total amount, it's just the amount that Daniel has made.

18:24.720 --> 18:32.080
So let's say, okay, so 28,000, 15%, do some like multiplication and division,

18:33.120 --> 18:41.600
you end up with about $40,000 made in revenue, which is exactly the same as the Social Blade

18:41.600 --> 18:48.800
midpoint. The more I dove into it, the more I realized how many more people were being screwed.

18:48.800 --> 18:52.320
This is not just a me problem anymore. When I started digging,

18:52.320 --> 18:57.200
I started asking the animators, how much were you getting paid? And the answers kept being the same,

18:57.200 --> 19:04.640
about $450 per month. For a month of work, they get $450, and it's not even consistent,

19:05.200 --> 19:10.000
because sometimes it takes more than a month to make a video, but you still get $450.

19:10.000 --> 19:14.160
Now, Stephen states in the description that this comment was actually incorrect, and although he

19:14.160 --> 19:19.280
got the details right, he got the maths wrong. Hosuh actually made 42,000 Canadian dollars,

19:19.280 --> 19:25.360
which means by estimates of the share, Dan would have comparatively made 280,000. He also calls out

19:25.360 --> 19:31.200
Dan for paying the animators who work for him $450 a month while on quote full time hours,

19:31.200 --> 19:35.520
in spite of the observed money he was making. Stephen uses Social Blade to back up his

19:35.520 --> 19:38.320
statements here, we'll hold these thoughts until later.

19:38.320 --> 19:43.840
Stephen- Daniel has essentially trapped any animator who actually wants to make a living,

19:43.840 --> 19:48.720
just by paying them like slave wages, while still making them work full time.

19:48.720 --> 19:53.280
One more point relates to the individual by the name of Jay. Now, Jay had appeared on Dan

19:53.280 --> 19:57.600
Plan's channel multiple times, often alongside Stephen. In this video, there is an air of

19:57.600 --> 20:02.080
uncertainty about Jay's role, however, one thing that many have observed were the similarities

20:02.080 --> 20:06.640
between Jay's and Stephen's personalities, leading many to theorise that Dan was planning

20:06.640 --> 20:11.680
on replacing Stephen with Jay altogether. Stephen says he feels that after the confrontation in

20:11.680 --> 20:16.880
early 2019, Dan was looking to do just that, as his mannerisms were very popular. However,

20:16.880 --> 20:21.520
Stephen didn't feel that Jay was a specific replacement, as he believed that no one could

20:21.520 --> 20:26.720
truly emulate his style. Stephen also discloses that Jay was being paid nothing whatsoever,

20:26.720 --> 20:31.040
which was surprising for many considering the numerous appearances he had made on the channel

20:31.040 --> 20:37.600
as well, although he was just a guest. Stephen- I knew for a fact that Daniel was trying to

20:37.600 --> 20:44.640
replace me after the fight that we had back in March, after the March incident.

20:47.280 --> 20:53.040
And I think because of that, it made me see like people around me as my replacements.

20:55.680 --> 21:02.400
Do I think Jay was a replacement? No. No one can emulate this greatness.

21:02.400 --> 21:05.840
So yeah, I don't think Jay was a replacement for anyone.

21:05.840 --> 21:10.080
However, the specifics were still shrouded in mystery. One thing that seemed prevalent in this

21:10.080 --> 21:14.720
case was the lack of evidence. A lot of what we'd heard up to this point was either party

21:14.720 --> 21:19.120
testimonies, or third party comments relayed through Stephen. This was also probably given

21:19.120 --> 21:24.080
that a lot of the anecdotes were based on verbal interactions, and obviously one doesn't typically

21:24.080 --> 21:28.880
think to record calls, it's not really considered kosher, so many people were eagerly awaiting

21:28.880 --> 21:35.600
Dan's response, and it was coming. But then to the stage left an unexpected guest, Jay himself.

21:35.600 --> 21:40.240
Now, Jay had been commenting on the situation from the sidelines, however, on the 17th of January,

21:40.240 --> 21:45.600
days before Dan would release his own response, Jay makes his video titled Why I say I'm not a part

21:45.600 --> 21:50.560
of DanPlan. Now, I'll add the disclaimer that this video is currently private, and we'll discuss that

21:50.560 --> 21:55.040
towards the end, but before we indulge in those details, we should probably investigate what the

21:55.040 --> 22:00.560
video exactly says. To summarise, it basically does what it says on the tin, with a bit more to

22:00.560 --> 22:04.960
boot. He opens it up with the acknowledgement that he's not as invested in it as other parties,

22:04.960 --> 22:08.800
but felt an inclination to contribute due to his position. He talks background about his

22:08.800 --> 22:12.880
relationship with Dan, why he was restricted in his commitment, stating that everything

22:12.880 --> 22:18.160
seemed fine until July 2019, a few months after Dan's confrontation with Stephen.

22:18.160 --> 22:27.040
So it's around this time, I guess, so July 2019, that I started to get a hunch or a feeling.

22:27.680 --> 22:31.600
I had a hunch that something was off with DanPlan channel internally.

22:32.960 --> 22:39.600
So I decided to do a small investigation privately, and when Dan found out about it

22:39.600 --> 22:46.320
that I was digging, he adamantly tried to make me drop it. He did not want me to dig around.

22:47.280 --> 22:51.360
And that is when I learned several extremely dangerous issues.

22:51.360 --> 22:57.200
In July 2019, Jay states that he began investigating some of the apparent internal issues of the channel,

22:57.200 --> 23:01.920
but when Daniel found out, he became quite agitated, and determined to steer attention away from these

23:01.920 --> 23:07.040
problems. However, according to Jay, this just led to more problems surfacing. Firstly, that of pay.

23:07.040 --> 23:11.840
Jay attests that when initially splitting the channel revenue, Dan split the revenue 50-50 with

23:11.840 --> 23:16.400
Hosuh in a purposeful attempt to block out Stephen. He states that when asking about this, Dan decided

23:16.400 --> 23:20.880
to deflect this decision onto various reasoning which did not appear particularly watertight.

23:21.840 --> 23:29.520
Dan later reasoned that the reason Stephen was left out was that Stephen was very uncaring about

23:29.520 --> 23:34.160
the YouTube project. The example Dan gave to me was that Stephen would be on his phone during

23:34.160 --> 23:40.160
the recording. I actually confirmed that was Stephen, that it only happened twice, and both

23:40.160 --> 23:46.320
occurred during a very long recording session, lasting 4 hours. One with the Hunger Game, and one

23:46.320 --> 23:53.920
with the Mafia. Stephen would also not do much in terms of the channel with editing, etc. But

23:55.760 --> 24:01.920
I'm pretty sure a lot of you Dan plan followers might know, Stephen had an incredibly massive

24:01.920 --> 24:08.160
influence at this point. He had a massive audience. He also clears up the changing of the

24:08.160 --> 24:12.320
share, stating Hosuh didn't want any money and wanted it invested back in the channel,

24:12.320 --> 24:17.520
yet Daniel continued to pass on a share to Hosuh regardless. Hosuh specifically told Dan that

24:18.400 --> 24:25.840
Hosuh did not want the channel money. Hosuh wanted Dan to use the money to grow the channel,

24:26.640 --> 24:34.480
but Dan later essentially pushed the money onto Hosuh for at least 15%, so the Dan plan revenue

24:34.480 --> 24:41.120
was split 85 to Dan, 15 to Hosuh. That's just a side note. So Stephen, and of course Stephen,

24:41.120 --> 24:45.440
zero. He goes on to talk about the incident where Stephen finds out about the money that Dan's

24:45.440 --> 24:51.200
making from the channel, and goes on to demand 20%. He also says this, which is curious.

24:51.200 --> 24:59.920
Stephen approached Dan about it later, about the monetary issue, and Stephen requested 20%

25:00.000 --> 25:10.480
of the channel share. Dan might say that it's 33%, that is not true. Stephen himself

25:10.480 --> 25:16.160
requested 20%. Something to keep in mind. So during these negotiations, Jay states that

25:16.160 --> 25:21.280
Daniel rejected Stephen's proposals wholly, obviously referencing the employee quotes.

25:21.280 --> 25:26.400
Currently Jay isn't saying anything particularly revelational in its implications, but 10 minutes

25:26.400 --> 25:31.040
in, it becomes a bit more implicative. I suggest we delve into that right now.

25:38.640 --> 25:42.480
Now I don't want to go through this video step by step, because for some people who will be

25:42.480 --> 25:46.480
familiar with the video already, that wouldn't be particularly helpful. So what I'm going to talk

25:46.480 --> 25:51.760
about is how the video characterises Dan, and which situations Jay uses to back these claims

25:52.320 --> 25:56.320
up. The first point that people in this situation thus far attested to is the

25:56.320 --> 26:01.040
notion of the lack of empathy on Dan's part, which has led to hurtful things being said,

26:01.040 --> 26:06.480
and Jay stays pretty consistent on this basis. He dives into how Daniel views the idea of shares.

26:06.480 --> 26:10.880
On the basis of Dan's employee comments, Jay decides to break down exactly why those comments

26:10.880 --> 26:15.520
were made, and the disparity between Stephen and Daniel's perspectives on a person's position

26:15.520 --> 26:20.640
in a business. Stephen's not dumb, and to be honest, he's one of the probably the smarter

26:20.640 --> 26:26.880
people that I met. He knows his self value, he knows his worth. The critical mistake that

26:26.880 --> 26:32.080
Dan makes at this point wasn't just rejecting the share proposal and then gutting it to zero,

26:32.080 --> 26:43.920
it's the implications behind that action. He had a very different unconventional definition

26:43.920 --> 26:49.920
for shares. For Dan, a share was something precious that only the originals could get.

26:50.720 --> 26:58.000
I just want to make a note that Dan's definition fluctuates greatly. Dan's definition of share

26:58.000 --> 27:03.840
doesn't even revolve around money. It's just a special title under a special law.

27:03.840 --> 27:07.840
Are you an original? No, then you get nothing. That was Dan's mindset.

27:08.400 --> 27:14.560
So even if Stephen was there when Dan physically made the channel, just by the virtue of Stephen

27:14.560 --> 27:21.440
not doing enough in Dan's eyes, Stephen's original title was withdrawn without even Stephen knowing.

27:21.440 --> 27:28.160
So when Dan told Stephen that he's getting 0%, Dan implicitly told Stephen not only that is he worth

27:28.160 --> 27:38.160
0% towards DanPlan, that he's not even a percentage worth towards DanPlan, he pretty much

27:38.160 --> 27:42.880
also told him that he's not even viewed as an original. Dan was telling an important asset to

27:42.880 --> 27:48.640
his company, DanPlan, who brings an enormous audience and had an immense potential regarding

27:48.640 --> 27:56.080
his charisma, humor, that he was just a member, an employee. Dan told Stephen that implicitly

27:56.640 --> 28:02.000
that he's a disposable unit, easily replaceable one. On the basis of these differing perspectives,

28:02.000 --> 28:06.640
it made Daniel's comments even more insulting, even if they made sense to him at the time.

28:06.640 --> 28:10.960
The fact that Stephen viewed shares as representative of contribution, and Daniel

28:10.960 --> 28:14.880
telling Stephen that he was going to be receiving absolutely nothing, gave Stephen the impression

28:14.880 --> 28:19.840
that Dan viewed his contribution as having no value whatsoever regardless of how much he was

28:19.840 --> 28:24.880
being paid. Jay also outlines that if Stephen was there originally, Dan's reasoning that Stephen

28:24.880 --> 28:29.600
didn't do enough meant that he wouldn't have been valued as a quote original either. Basically,

28:29.600 --> 28:34.000
there were a plethora of excuses that Daniel could pull to make sure other associates were

28:34.000 --> 28:39.680
locked down to the depository, but why was he locking people out? Well, the second attribute

28:39.680 --> 28:44.400
I would use to describe Jay's perspective of Dan is nihilistic, indifferent, and that obviously

28:44.400 --> 28:48.720
isn't going to be well received in a community with an emotionally invested audience. Jay claims

28:48.720 --> 28:54.240
that Dan doesn't pay his animators well, often paying full-time animators around 450 Canadian

28:54.240 --> 28:59.600
dollars a month, which is around 320 American dollars, not really sustainable for a full-time

28:59.600 --> 29:05.680
job. It's a giant sweatshop. Originally, there were three animators when they just started off,

29:05.680 --> 29:14.480
HOSA included, now they are at 12 without HOSA. They get paid an inconsistent $450 Canadian per

29:14.480 --> 29:21.280
month at best, and I have seen one example of Dan actually guilt tripping and haggling animators for

29:21.280 --> 29:25.760
their pricing. Jay does observe that there are part-time animators but claims that Daniel doesn't

29:25.760 --> 29:30.080
really treat them differently or recognise the nuance. He also states that when surveying said

29:30.080 --> 29:35.200
animators, a large majority, that being 8 out of 10 of them, weren't happy with the work environment.

29:35.280 --> 29:40.080
The morale is low, there's no sense of community, the list goes on, but they say the same thing.

29:40.080 --> 29:45.280
Dan is an insecure employer. Instead of polishing and motivating the current animator team,

29:45.280 --> 29:51.360
all he does is just hire non-stop to replace those who leave the team. Because of this,

29:52.400 --> 30:00.880
there is minimal difference between the full-time animators and the part-time animators. Another

30:00.880 --> 30:05.120
issue that I found within the animation team is that they're no longer a community that they

30:05.120 --> 30:10.560
hoped it was. Before, when it was three animators, maybe four, maybe five even, including HOSA,

30:11.360 --> 30:14.640
they were a community, they talked to each other, they played games with each other,

30:15.440 --> 30:20.720
they enjoyed their time with each other. Now, with 12 on the board, and I think there was more

30:20.720 --> 30:26.400
before, that's no longer the case, they're essentially cubicle slaves. I don't see any

30:26.400 --> 30:31.360
activity within the server, I don't see them talking to each other, and as far as you can

30:31.360 --> 30:35.840
tell, they are just living in their own corner. In addition to this, Jay talks about the time

30:35.840 --> 30:40.160
Daniel asked him to replace HOSA, given that HOSA is going away for a couple years.

30:40.160 --> 30:45.360
HOSA agreed to this willingly. Basically, I was supposed to replace HOSA. HOSA has already

30:45.360 --> 30:51.680
left Korea for his mandatory military service for the next two years. So, I decided to ask Dan

30:51.680 --> 30:57.040
implicitly if I would get shares. The answer was no, I would get nothing. I was pretty much told

30:57.040 --> 31:01.840
the same thing as Stephen, even though I was still technically one of the originals, I was there for

31:01.840 --> 31:06.960
I believe the second video and onward, but I wasn't original enough for Dan.

31:06.960 --> 31:12.400
Daniel once again presented no offer in return, before stating that he could receive an hourly

31:12.400 --> 31:17.280
recording rate of $20, which once again, considering the money that Jay and Stephen

31:17.280 --> 31:22.640
stipulate Daniel is making, is a rather laughable sum. How do you explain such behaviour? Well,

31:22.640 --> 31:27.600
Jay implies really that as the owner and main benefactor of the channel, Dan recognises that

31:27.600 --> 31:32.080
he has the power, and that as the man with the decision making power, he can make decisions that

31:32.080 --> 31:36.480
are unfavourable to everyone else, and they will have to decide whether they like it or leave it.

31:37.040 --> 31:41.680
Jay states that Daniel appears to treat the high turnover with a level of detachment, stating that

31:41.680 --> 31:46.160
it's just the way it is, and that people come and go, so there's no real point in cultivating an

31:46.160 --> 31:50.880
overly friendly environment. Dan seems to embrace the consequences, after all, if someone doesn't

31:50.880 --> 31:56.160
like the job they're doing, they can just leave, right? That's how jobs work. But during my

31:56.160 --> 32:02.800
investigation, he says this to me, and this is to quote Dan, people will leave eventually, no one

32:02.800 --> 32:07.520
plans on staying at one place forever. And that was his excuse to do nothing about the animation

32:07.520 --> 32:13.040
team, nothing else. If you want to leave, leave. I'm not telling you to stay here forever,

32:13.840 --> 32:18.640
I'm not gonna do anything. I mean, on principle, yes, but Jay's issue extends to the fact that many

32:18.640 --> 32:23.280
people don't have much of an option, they need to find work, and Dan plan is such an established

32:23.280 --> 32:26.880
channel that people will work for it without question, which leads to a race to the bottom

32:26.880 --> 32:31.600
regarding pay, and it's not that Daniel can't offer more, it's a question of whether he should,

32:31.600 --> 32:36.000
but Dan doesn't really seem concerned with that, people come and go, and if they don't like working

32:36.000 --> 32:40.960
for him, then they don't need to. It seems that sentiment extended to even cast members like

32:40.960 --> 32:47.440
Steven. I warned Dan about this exact thing happening five months ago. On August 10th,

32:47.440 --> 32:53.520
2019, after talking with Steven, Hosuh, and Dan when I was telling about the investigation,

32:53.520 --> 32:58.240
I predicted that Steven would leave Dan plan, and due to certain promises with Dan,

32:58.800 --> 33:04.640
I gave Dan a hypothetical. What will you do if someone leaves Dan plan? Let it be me,

33:04.640 --> 33:10.320
Hosuh, Steven, or a group of animators, or just one single animator, what will you do? And this

33:10.320 --> 33:17.440
was his response. To quote Dan, I don't care who leaves, this is my channel, and I will run it

33:17.440 --> 33:23.360
based on my belief. If it sinks because of that, it sinks. That leads me to my next point, Jay's

33:23.360 --> 33:27.600
implication that Dan is pretty arrogant. It's not just the fact that he's trying to get away with

33:27.600 --> 33:32.560
paying people as little as possible, because he is allegedly indifferent, but he views himself as

33:32.560 --> 33:37.120
the lifeblood of the channel. If he believes that people can come and go at any stage, then he must

33:37.120 --> 33:42.240
believe in the power of his own talent, with or without his friends. Everyone else was disposable

33:42.240 --> 33:47.120
but him, and if the channel went down, he went down with it. Which brings us to the next point,

33:47.120 --> 33:53.120
determination. Dan told me that he would support me if I made my own channel, so that I can get

33:53.120 --> 33:57.520
started there, but I wouldn't get anything from Dan plan, and that I would get referenced in his

33:57.520 --> 34:03.360
channel. Basically publicity or exposure pay, and to quote Dan again, go make your own channel. I

34:03.360 --> 34:07.280
will support you, give you shout outs, help you get sponsors, but you will never get a share from

34:07.280 --> 34:15.200
Dan plan. For those who might not fully understand what Dan just said, Dan told one of his potentially

34:15.200 --> 34:20.640
core members to go make his own company and earn money through that way, and that I would get

34:20.640 --> 34:25.520
nothing from Dan plan, and that I won't get anything that I seemingly deserved.

34:25.520 --> 34:30.960
Daniel had a vision of what Dan plan should be in the conflict regarding pay. Jay states that Dan

34:30.960 --> 34:35.920
justified this by comparing it to VanossGaming, a significantly popular creator who boasts

34:35.920 --> 34:40.800
highlights of him playing games with his friends, but Jay notes that this isn't really fair as the

34:40.800 --> 34:46.720
creators at Vanoss all grew from the same position. For those who may not know Vanoss, he is like 10

34:46.720 --> 34:53.680
plus, I forgot his sub count, but he is a giant in YouTube community who does a lot of collab work

34:53.680 --> 34:59.920
with his online friends, but the difference between Vanoss and Dan plan is that when Vanoss

34:59.920 --> 35:07.360
reached out to do collabs, they, everyone in that channel, already had their own channel,

35:07.360 --> 35:14.000
like they, they were buddies because they were new and they worked together. What Dan was pretty

35:14.000 --> 35:19.840
much telling us was, I know you have nothing, go make your own thing and do it that way.

35:20.560 --> 35:25.520
Dan offered to pay Jay in various shout outs if Jay set up his own channel, but this wasn't what Jay

35:25.520 --> 35:31.040
was interested in, and Jay found this suggestion insulting. But that was Dan's idea, he wanted his

35:31.040 --> 35:35.840
channel, they could have theirs, his vision would not be compromised. Jay states that when he did

35:35.840 --> 35:40.240
do some investigating into the problems of the channel, and raised the alarm, Dan told Jay to

35:40.240 --> 35:45.120
stop interfering because Dan knew what he was doing. Maybe that was arrogance, but it's framed

35:45.120 --> 35:47.760
as conscious enough to be assured in its final goal.

35:47.760 --> 35:52.720
Jay- But his argument, or rebuttal for a lot of things that I said, or that I brought up, was that

35:52.720 --> 35:57.840
he knew what he was doing. He knew what, or he was in this a lot longer and he's aware of it.

35:57.840 --> 36:04.880
And basically he's denied or swept a lot of the crucial bits and pieces of the problem right

36:04.880 --> 36:12.320
under. And his reply to my investigation was, to quote him, to quote Dan again,

36:12.320 --> 36:17.840
Jay, from now on, don't ever interfere or dig around in the inner workings of the channel.

36:17.840 --> 36:23.760
It's my channel. What he implied with that was basically, he told me to fuck off when I was

36:23.760 --> 36:24.640
trying to help him.

36:24.640 --> 36:29.840
Jay's perspective added a rationale behind the allegations, it gave Daniel's behaviour a sense of

36:29.840 --> 36:34.400
logic, but not logic that was flattering in any sense at all. It frayed him as a person who was aware

36:34.400 --> 36:39.520
of the relative power that he held, often using it to very little other than his status, using the

36:39.520 --> 36:44.880
concept of free will to absolve wrongdoing. If you don't like it, leave, with the awareness that

36:44.880 --> 36:50.720
really no one wanted to upset the apple cart. So now we have the stories, now we have an explanation,

36:50.720 --> 36:57.520
however, this was just another perspective, and it wasn't Dan's. But whether Dan was innocent or not,

36:57.520 --> 37:02.400
he was the kind of guy to reply, and oh boy, did he.

37:14.880 --> 37:24.080
By this point, audience response was very sceptical towards Daniel. These videos painted him treating

37:24.080 --> 37:29.280
the channel with a level of nonchalant darwinism, which harmed numerous friendships in the process.

37:29.280 --> 37:34.480
Jay attests that he felt Dan stopped treating him as a friend and only messaged him for business purposes,

37:34.480 --> 37:36.480
which seemingly upset him a lot.

37:36.480 --> 37:42.880
I haven't heard Dan reach out to me just for the sake of saying hi. Whatever he did, it was always for

37:42.880 --> 37:48.560
contact. Let me ask you guys something. Tell me a job or an occupation where you have an hourly

37:48.560 --> 37:54.640
rate and is expected to be available upon call for your service or entertainment, with erratic

37:54.640 --> 38:00.960
and inconsistent work hours, and that once your service and entertainment value is done, you are

38:00.960 --> 38:05.760
shooed away, you're no longer contacted until your next service when you're next called, and you're

38:05.760 --> 38:10.400
just an outsider even after frequent use. Because I'll tell you what I felt like when being told

38:10.400 --> 38:14.880
like this. He was pretty much treating me like a call girl, a stripper or a hooker that he can

38:14.880 --> 38:20.720
just call on dial on demand. It's actually really hard to damage my pride. I'm not the one to put

38:20.720 --> 38:28.320
heavy pride value on the physical being called Jay, but kudos to Dan. He managed to piss me off to

38:28.320 --> 38:33.360
a degree to the point of hurting my pride. These details did not merely harm Daniel's

38:33.360 --> 38:37.680
personal image, but they compromised the whole premise of the DanPlan channel pushed by their

38:37.680 --> 38:41.680
By The Way series, which was this bunch of friends getting along and having a good time.

38:41.680 --> 38:45.760
DanPlan was the sort of channel where people just wanted to imagine that they were supporting good

38:45.760 --> 38:50.480
people who were supporting each other, and that was the shock, and that's why people were upset.

38:50.480 --> 38:54.720
Videos were uploaded, comments were left, a lot of people had a lot of strong feelings,

38:54.720 --> 38:59.280
and yet in spite of that, a lot of these fans wanted to believe in Dan and they did not

38:59.280 --> 39:03.840
write him off, which leads us to the 20th of January and Daniel's own response video,

39:03.840 --> 39:08.560
and he's gone full black screen, full stop in the title, ladies and gentlemen,

39:08.560 --> 39:15.280
we were in for a ride. Did Daniel save himself? Well, it's complicated, let me explain.

39:15.280 --> 39:19.440
The first 23 minutes were a response to the initial video upload by Stephen,

39:19.440 --> 39:25.280
and the next 32 were a bit of a sporadic response to Stephen's dream. Now each part has its flaws,

39:25.280 --> 39:30.640
but not because I finished thinking it made Daniel a bad person, actually I'd argue it

39:30.640 --> 39:36.800
humanised his perspective much more, but humanisation doesn't necessarily mean justification.

39:36.800 --> 39:41.280
There's some good stuff here, there's some not so good stuff here, and it's not gonna break itself

39:41.280 --> 39:46.480
down, so I suggest we dissect, while looking retrospectively at what the other videos presented

39:46.480 --> 39:51.440
against him said and seeing how they hold up as well. I will try and get through everything,

39:51.440 --> 39:56.480
there's gonna be a lot of discussion and a lot of opinions. Straight out the gate, if Daniel wants

39:56.480 --> 40:00.720
some simple advice, it would be that he should have combined the receipts of the second part

40:00.720 --> 40:05.120
with the structure of the first, it would have made it a lot more effective and impactful.

40:05.120 --> 40:08.880
That said, it doesn't mean that we can't do that ourselves and see what it reveals.

40:08.880 --> 40:13.360
For example, Dan tends to present the notion that Stephen had a tendency to ambush him.

40:13.360 --> 40:18.000
He concedes that he had outbursts, even showing an apology that he sent to Stephen at the time

40:18.000 --> 40:22.480
of the dispute, however, frames it from the perspective that Stephen had provoked him into

40:22.480 --> 40:30.640
that reaction. On February 26th of 2019, Stephen asked if I could get on a call with him to discuss

40:30.640 --> 40:37.360
about our VidCon and Disneyland trip, which made sense to me, so I said yes because I had to buy

40:37.360 --> 40:42.240
him his tickets and I needed his passport information anyway, so I got on the call,

40:42.240 --> 40:47.360
but that was not what he wanted to talk about. When I got on the call, instead of talking about

40:47.360 --> 40:53.200
VidCon or Disneyland, him and another associate of his was on the other line. Stephen has said

40:53.200 --> 40:58.400
that he heard from hosted that we were making more money now, so I said yes, but then Stephen

40:58.400 --> 41:05.440
continued to say with his associate that if he doesn't get 33% of the company and the revenue,

41:05.440 --> 41:11.600
that he is going to leave the channel. At the time, I felt betrayed that he held no remorse

41:11.600 --> 41:17.120
of leaving, that he had no sympathy for our hard work, and that he suddenly changed his mind about

41:17.120 --> 41:23.440
everything that he used to say about YouTube, now that we're making more money. Obviously, I was happy

41:23.440 --> 41:29.360
to give him more money. We were making more money, so to pay him for his talents is fine, but I was

41:29.360 --> 41:35.520
angry at his approach, so we fought. We didn't fight for one hour, we didn't fight for a day, we fought

41:35.520 --> 41:42.240
for a couple of days. It was back and forth, and we have said a lot of things to each other, which

41:42.320 --> 41:49.840
I apologized immediately after I got off the phone, and it wasn't pretty. I don't remember a lot of

41:49.840 --> 41:56.560
things we said to each other, because it was 11 months ago, but the emotions are all still here.

41:56.560 --> 42:01.680
In a way, this makes sense. Receipts back up that Stephen had baited Dan into a call. In a way,

42:01.680 --> 42:06.160
it makes sense that he may have made some cruel comments in the heat of the moment. He doesn't seem

42:06.160 --> 42:11.360
like an inherently cruel person, and even in the stream, Stephen made one comment that always stuck

42:11.360 --> 42:25.440
to me. And I'm often less critical of streams, because they're not scripted, they're not organized,

42:25.440 --> 42:29.600
you have to take what people say in the moment with a pinch of salt, but the structure of this comment

42:29.600 --> 42:33.600
always said to me that he acknowledged that Dan may have been behaving irrationally at that point,

42:33.600 --> 42:39.040
regardless of the fact that he said it, and Daniel admits it, it makes sense that maybe he'd be angry

42:39.040 --> 42:44.560
at that point. This doesn't make the comment right, but with this situation, it adds up. I can see why

42:44.560 --> 42:50.000
that would upset Stephen, and I'm not invalidating that, but Dan justifies why he would be upset too.

42:50.000 --> 42:54.640
We say cruel things sometimes. However, for a moment, we need to remember that this dispute

42:54.640 --> 42:59.280
didn't start in the call. The dispute started before the call, because there is a fundamental

42:59.280 --> 43:04.320
difference in how these two people view contribution, and that disagreement is once again put

43:04.320 --> 43:10.640
under the microscope in Dan's video. And in these parts, he can come across as a bit elitist.

43:10.640 --> 43:14.960
For the rest of that summer, we put all our time and effort into making more videos,

43:14.960 --> 43:19.840
in running the channel. Hosuh was drawing animations, I was writing scripts, I was editing,

43:19.840 --> 43:25.520
and just overall just, you know, running the channel as a channel. It was a good time.

43:25.520 --> 43:32.400
Stephen was just still coming on occasionally, recording, and then leaving for weeks or months at

43:32.400 --> 43:38.160
a time while we did it, but that was okay too. He said he's doing this for fun, he's just doing this

43:38.160 --> 43:45.040
a hobby, he didn't see it as a career, and we were all okay with that. As the channel grew, we started

43:45.040 --> 43:52.720
making revenue, actual money. It was insane, and when it happened, it happened suddenly, and it was

43:52.720 --> 43:57.520
something we never really expected. When we started to make money, I told Stephen that we

43:57.520 --> 44:03.280
want to pay him. He declined, but I insisted that he at least take something for his time of

44:03.280 --> 44:10.320
recording with us, so we mutually decided to pay him $25 an hour for his recording times. This is

44:10.320 --> 44:19.200
where the $225 came into play, from September 22nd of 2018 to February 22nd of 2019. Of that six months,

44:19.200 --> 44:25.200
he worked a total of nine hours, which was fine. I thought that was compensating something for his

44:25.200 --> 44:30.000
time. He was having fun with his friends and getting some cash out of it. I didn't care if he

44:30.000 --> 44:34.960
didn't work a lot, he wasn't taking YouTube seriously. And of course, I wanted to compensate him more,

44:34.960 --> 44:40.320
so I was going to take him to Disneyland and VidCon, all expenses paid. We would have a lot of fun.

44:40.320 --> 44:47.920
The fact that he valued his 30 to 40 minutes of recording, the same with the amount of sacrifice

44:47.920 --> 44:54.800
and effort the whole set I put onto the channel was insulting, and it made me angry.

44:54.800 --> 44:59.520
Now in principle, I can understand why Daniel would clearly view this input as somewhat limited,

44:59.520 --> 45:04.400
and not to the degree that he has committed. But everyone who's involved with YouTube knows that

45:04.400 --> 45:09.760
firstly, a creative job extends beyond recording, and in Stephen's video, he vocally calls attention

45:09.760 --> 45:14.560
to the characters that he fleshed out, and the effort that he put in. He may have recorded for

45:14.560 --> 45:19.520
a certain amount of time, but the impact and the thought of these characters exist beyond that.

45:19.520 --> 45:23.440
Informal Mafia Stephen, Huggy Zombie Apocalypse Stephen,

45:23.440 --> 45:29.120
Mahosa Stephen. Daniel didn't give me a script to do those characters, I made them up,

45:29.120 --> 45:34.800
and I made my personalities enjoyable. But to Daniel, every recording session, I was merely

45:34.800 --> 45:39.520
talking to friends. To him, I wasn't putting in any effort into the videos.

45:39.520 --> 45:42.960
On top of this, it's important to remember, it's not just about the amount of work one does,

45:42.960 --> 45:47.440
but their contribution to the branding and image of the channel. If your face is on the merch,

45:47.440 --> 45:51.680
if you're advertised besides the brands, if people come for your quotes in the videos,

45:51.680 --> 45:56.640
that's prospective income based on viewership and support. It doesn't matter if that character was

45:56.640 --> 46:00.960
fostered in 5 minutes or 5 years, because a majority of financial income for these sorts

46:00.960 --> 46:05.440
of channels will come from the audience connection with the character. A characterisation that brings

46:05.440 --> 46:09.680
people entertainment or hope, or anything of the sorts is not something you can base

46:09.680 --> 46:14.000
solely on the work behind the scenes, even if it is significantly more difficult than the work

46:14.000 --> 46:18.720
in front of the camera or the microphone. The first abject disagreement we encounter

46:18.720 --> 46:23.920
though is regarding negotiation details. Stephen states that in the call he requested a 20%

46:23.920 --> 46:28.160
share of income, which is corroborated by Jay. Daniel frames it much more harshly,

46:28.160 --> 46:32.720
stating that Stephen demanded a third of the income share, or else he was going to walk.

46:32.720 --> 46:39.280
Stephen continued to say with his associate that if he doesn't get 33% of the company

46:39.280 --> 46:42.400
and the revenue that he is going to leave the channel.

46:42.400 --> 46:46.800
Now this point was anticipated in Jay's video, that clip I told you to keep in mind.

46:46.800 --> 46:51.520
Some people have used this as a means to invalidate Daniel's point, but anticipating what some will

46:51.520 --> 46:56.320
say does not necessarily mean it's invalid unless you have solid evidence for that assertion,

46:56.320 --> 47:01.120
and all Jay stated was that Dan may be confused as someone else proposed it. Now this may be the

47:01.120 --> 47:05.760
mysterious figure that Daniel alluded to, however there is very little detail regarding the identity

47:05.760 --> 47:10.560
of this additional person, other than they would need to have been physically with Stephen at that

47:10.560 --> 47:15.520
point, as we can see the 7 minute call was between two users. Due to Stephen's streaming comments,

47:15.520 --> 47:18.960
some people have said it was Hosuh, but I think in Stephen's video and streams,

47:18.960 --> 47:23.120
he was implying that Hosuh had been negotiating following the call rather than in the call.

47:23.520 --> 47:28.480
And I made Hosuh get involved as well. Hosuh, I really am sorry that I made you get involved

47:28.480 --> 47:33.760
in my fight, but I'm also really grateful that you did. What I do find strange is following these

47:33.760 --> 47:39.360
aggressive negotiations, that they then settled on a still rather underwhelming $100 per video

47:39.360 --> 47:44.000
Stephen, which if you consider the alleged income of the channel is still less than 1%.

47:44.000 --> 47:49.360
I insisted that he at least take something for his time of recording with us, so we mutually

47:49.360 --> 47:53.600
decided to pay him $25 an hour for his recording times.

47:53.600 --> 47:58.960
Daniel signals that he insisted Stephen took 25 per hour of recording prior to these negotiations,

47:58.960 --> 48:03.520
despite Stephen's apparent refusal at the time, and uses it like he's a generous guy,

48:03.520 --> 48:07.920
but then decides not to insist Stephen have any more after his apparent aggressive

48:07.920 --> 48:11.920
dissatisfaction. It doesn't add up here, and that's not the only thing.

48:11.920 --> 48:20.880
After the March incident, we renegotiated my salary, or rather the amount of pay I was getting.

48:22.240 --> 48:29.600
And I remember him saying, what do you want to get paid now? I said $100, $100 per video.

48:29.600 --> 48:33.440
I didn't say that, but he offered it, and I was like, okay, fine, whatever.

48:33.440 --> 48:38.880
And then afterwards, he said, okay, I hope you know that $100 is a lot of money.

48:38.880 --> 48:46.160
He says that I made him take the $100 per video, and that I guilt-tripped him into taking it,

48:46.160 --> 48:53.360
and I forced him to take it. These are untrue. At the end of our fight, when he decided to stay,

48:53.360 --> 48:58.800
he then told me that he wants $100 per video. He could have said more.

49:00.720 --> 49:06.320
I would have not mined that. That wasn't the point of the fight. That was not the point of the

49:06.320 --> 49:06.820
argument.

49:10.000 --> 49:14.640
When I say I find these details strange, I don't mean I find them strange in the sense that they

49:14.640 --> 49:19.280
incriminate Daniel, but it equally doesn't make me think that this is a one-sided affair, or that

49:19.280 --> 49:24.320
he's blasted these allegations away. Unless Stephen planned out how to throw the channel

49:24.320 --> 49:28.800
under the bus in a dramatic way ten months in advance, which there is no evidence of,

49:28.800 --> 49:33.040
I have trouble seeing this specific argument as anything else than a couple guys with vastly

49:33.040 --> 49:37.040
different perspectives clashing furiously over them, realising that it wasn't getting them

49:37.040 --> 49:42.640
anywhere, and coming to some sort of reconciliation with the expectation that, for both of their sides,

49:42.640 --> 49:47.040
it could improve. But it wasn't a real reconciliation, because the initial problem

49:47.040 --> 49:52.240
that provoked it was still there. Both sides are just full of interpretations that view the other

49:52.240 --> 49:57.200
perspective in unequivocally bad faith. Stephen says that Dan claiming something's a lot of money

49:57.200 --> 50:02.160
was manipulation, when he might just be a stingy person. Dan states that Stephen was claiming that

50:02.160 --> 50:06.320
Daniel tricked him into taking less money, but Stephen never claimed that because he notes that

50:06.320 --> 50:10.960
they'd already agreed on a figure. As for who proposed it, who knows, as most of the fans

50:10.960 --> 50:16.800
recognised it was like watching an embarrassing divorce. Daniel's video can be equally as cynical

50:16.800 --> 50:21.360
as Stephen's, they have highly cynical perspectives on each other's actions. For example, Stephen

50:21.360 --> 50:27.120
viewed his request of asking what more he can do as a genuine plea to try and earn his place on the

50:27.120 --> 50:31.840
channel and a greater share of the business, and Dan's perspective didn't connect with me at all

50:31.840 --> 50:38.320
about this. But when he saw that his initial strategy wasn't working, during our argument,

50:38.880 --> 50:45.920
he switched and said, what can I do to get more percentage? At that point, I realised that

50:46.640 --> 50:53.200
appreciation or more involvement wasn't what he was looking for, but more profit. That's why we

50:53.200 --> 50:57.440
fought. Like you say you considered him a friend at all points, and then say something like that.

50:57.440 --> 51:00.880
Like you acknowledge it was a heat of the moment argument, but then make a point which would

51:00.880 --> 51:06.240
question his intent regardless in that moment. And it's not like I think Dan is at liberty to

51:06.240 --> 51:10.880
give anyone any more of a management role in his channel. From the perspective of management,

51:10.880 --> 51:15.200
if that's what he wants to retain, then that is fair. Dan wanted control of the channel,

51:15.200 --> 51:20.080
I don't think he's completely arrogant as other videos have portrayed, but I do think he likes

51:20.080 --> 51:24.400
to do things his way, and he didn't want interference, he wants to be the director,

51:24.400 --> 51:29.520
and that's okay. But I think Stephen genuinely wanted to justify and solidify his role,

51:29.520 --> 51:34.320
but I don't think Dan had anything to offer. I don't know if Dan's trying to completely

51:34.320 --> 51:38.000
shield his image, but an explanation like this would make much more sense than the

51:38.000 --> 51:42.720
clumsy account that he provided. I think the main problem here was that there was no real

51:42.720 --> 51:47.440
way to justify that someone's character was worth less than 1% of the channel's worth,

51:47.440 --> 51:51.840
and by not offering even a share of that, it clearly left a bad taste in Stephen's mouth.

51:51.840 --> 51:56.000
In his original video, Stephen states that he asked a very specific question twice,

51:56.000 --> 51:57.680
asking how much his worth is.

52:13.840 --> 52:20.080
And although he left details out of Dan's reply in the DMs, the political, vague nature

52:20.080 --> 52:25.440
is highly unsatisfying. Simple as Stephen wanted to know his worth, but I don't think Dan either

52:25.440 --> 52:30.880
knew or wanted to think about it. This is also why he probably offered to help Stephen in the

52:30.880 --> 52:34.960
creation of his own channel, this sentiment was echoed in Jay's video, and although Dan didn't

52:34.960 --> 52:39.040
get the chance to respond to that one, it was a similar message, he wanted to help grow his

52:39.040 --> 52:43.280
friends' own channels, and shout them out, even mentioning VanossGaming.

52:43.280 --> 52:52.720
I suggested an idea to Stephen, that we make him a channel, a channel of his own, a company

52:52.720 --> 52:59.360
that he can run. I did this for a couple of main reasons. One, so that he can have the freedom

52:59.360 --> 53:05.840
to create, and the business decisions that he wants to make is his own. Two, I wanted him to

53:05.840 --> 53:15.360
learn how much effort, and time, and sacrifice it takes to run a channel. And lastly, I wanted us to

53:15.360 --> 53:23.920
have a partnership. Once I realized he wanted to take YouTube seriously, I wanted him to make a

53:23.920 --> 53:28.960
channel of his own, where we would promote it, where we would try to help it grow, where I would

53:28.960 --> 53:37.280
give him and suggest things that help a channel to grow faster, and hopefully develop a relationship

53:37.280 --> 53:43.760
like, you know, the VanossGaming group, or the David Dobrik group, but he declined.

53:43.840 --> 53:48.240
Once again, it just seems like a fundamental disagreement of how they wanted to operate.

53:48.240 --> 53:52.880
Not everyone wants their own channel, and it's a very strange philosophy that Daniel has, though I

53:52.880 --> 53:59.040
think he genuinely believes it. He wants you to understand the sacrifice. It's daft. And of course,

53:59.040 --> 54:03.200
Stephen would have been able to understand the work if Daniel had given him a way to earn his share,

54:03.200 --> 54:07.520
but Daniel didn't value his intent at that point. If you didn't want someone to expect more from

54:07.520 --> 54:10.960
a channel that their face is featured on, you shouldn't have let them on the channel.

54:10.960 --> 54:15.280
On top of this, the character dynamic in gaming videos like Vanoss is so unbelievably different

54:15.280 --> 54:20.400
to the BTW series that there's no real way to draw a parallel which justifies that point of view.

54:20.400 --> 54:24.480
I would argue that with gaming channels, there are many more other in-game factors that can

54:24.480 --> 54:29.360
influence the entertainment value of the content and its marketability, and although there are

54:29.360 --> 54:33.680
other elements to consider with Dan Plan's animated content too, the interplay between

54:33.680 --> 54:38.880
the cast is such a significant selling point, it's not the same. I do wonder if Daniel had a

54:38.880 --> 54:43.360
legitimate nostalgia for his gaming days and the creative control that it gave him.

54:43.360 --> 54:48.480
In spite of all these points, the way situation does go both ways. Dan stated that it was Stephen

54:48.480 --> 54:53.600
who offered the $100 rate that they switched to, so the responsibility of that fact has to

54:53.600 --> 54:58.640
partly lie on him, providing it's true. But Stephen's point after this argument wasn't that

54:58.640 --> 55:03.440
he wasn't satisfied with the money, but that no matter how hard he tried, he wasn't recognised,

55:03.440 --> 55:08.640
he didn't feel like he was a friend, he wanted to be noticed by Dan, he wanted to be credited by Dan,

55:08.640 --> 55:12.480
and he wasn't. He portrays himself as not being obsessed with the money,

55:12.480 --> 55:14.320
in fact, rather claiming Dan was.

55:38.640 --> 55:46.960
And when Stephen quit Dan Plan,

55:47.520 --> 55:53.200
he's told me that he still wants to be paid for all the videos that will be posted in the future,

55:53.200 --> 55:57.120
which I said I would honour, but then on the livestream he goes on to say

56:09.040 --> 56:10.960
which contradicts what he texted me.

56:10.960 --> 56:15.440
But this is one of the weaker rebuttals again, you don't have to care specifically about the

56:15.440 --> 56:19.680
money to still want it for the work you've done, because it could be about what the money

56:19.680 --> 56:24.480
represents, a recognition of one's work that they've put in. I don't care about sponsor money

56:24.480 --> 56:29.360
that much, but when I do the sponsor, I still expect the payments, for my own personal pride,

56:29.360 --> 56:34.080
to know that I'm worth it. If he really cared about the money, I find it unlikely that he would

56:34.080 --> 56:38.240
have settled for such a proportionally low amount given how much the audience valued him,

56:38.240 --> 56:43.440
regardless of Dan's perspective. It's very easy to blow up this drama, and it did blow up,

56:43.440 --> 56:48.320
and everyone piled on, but you can't lose sight of what inspired it, the fact that a person just

56:48.320 --> 56:53.120
didn't feel like he was part of a family that the audience perceived as existing. That's what you

56:53.120 --> 56:58.160
had to combat, and in a way Dan did combat that, but he kind of misses the point again.

56:58.160 --> 57:02.400
If I really thought of him nothing more than an employee, I would have never taken him to

57:02.400 --> 57:08.960
VidCon or Disneyland. If I was not friends with him, I wouldn't be friends with him.

57:10.080 --> 57:20.640
If I thought that I didn't think of him as a friend, I wouldn't invite him to go camping

57:20.640 --> 57:28.640
with me. I wouldn't introduce him to my girlfriend or my family. I wouldn't take him to camping.

57:28.640 --> 57:32.640
I wouldn't try to go watch movies with him. I wouldn't invite him to the parties I would

57:32.640 --> 57:36.720
only invite my friends over to. There are no real receipts provided for this,

57:36.720 --> 57:40.640
I'll provide benefit of the doubt that they probably happened, because it doesn't change

57:40.640 --> 57:45.520
the point. The point was that whatever happened outside of YouTube, it was an insult to Stephen

57:45.520 --> 57:49.920
Howe he was treated on the channel. He felt like an employee, he felt perceived as one,

57:49.920 --> 57:55.440
and I believe that. I struggle to imagine doing a collaborative channel with a legitimate friend

57:55.440 --> 58:00.560
and not having a shares-based agreement, but simply put, I don't think Daniel viewed it as

58:00.560 --> 58:03.760
collaborative. I think that no matter what happened in their discussion, no matter how

58:03.760 --> 58:09.040
angry they got, the fact that they never came to the agreement that there was a way to share income

58:09.040 --> 58:14.000
was the most indicative factor in the failure of their friendship, because a share is not just

58:14.000 --> 58:20.080
worth, it is trust, and there was no trust here. It's claimed that Daniel doesn't even share income

58:20.080 --> 58:24.960
details with Hosuh, but that is not mentioned. Dan references the trips to Disneyland and VidCon,

58:24.960 --> 58:29.280
but Stephen himself, in the stream that Dan responded to, said that he felt the intent

58:29.280 --> 58:34.880
wasn't there. When we went to Disneyland is pretty much when I thought it was getting better.

58:37.760 --> 58:39.840
But then I saw Daniel pull out a camera.

58:42.480 --> 58:48.000
And then I knew for a fact that he just wanted me to dance. So I danced.

58:51.840 --> 58:54.480
And then I knew for a fact that things weren't going to get better.

58:55.600 --> 59:00.560
In the Disneyland video itself, uploaded to DanPlan, Stephen makes a pretty snide quip

59:00.560 --> 59:11.360
that was left in. That aside, because Dan was quite possessive regarding what he viewed as

59:11.360 --> 59:17.600
his own channel, Stephen interpreted it as a sense of worth, and greater, trust. Maybe it was to an

59:17.600 --> 59:22.560
extent, I don't know, but I don't think it was necessarily malice on Dan's behalf, I think it

59:22.560 --> 59:28.000
was ignorance. And I think that ignorance was willful to an extent. I forgot to mention at

59:28.000 --> 59:33.120
the end of the video because I got a little emotional, but for transparency sake, I want

59:33.120 --> 59:38.160
to say that I have heard whispers of Stephen planning to do something along the lines of

59:38.160 --> 59:43.200
making a video after he left, so it wasn't a hundred percent surprise when it happened.

59:43.760 --> 59:49.360
Nevertheless, the content was still upsetting, and that's why it was still very shocking.

59:49.680 --> 59:59.680
I wanted to end the video there, I didn't want to say anything more, that was just my side of the story.

59:59.680 --> 01:00:04.720
I don't think Dan was that shocked. I think the strains must have been clear, and Dan didn't do

01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:09.440
enough to avert it because he probably never considered the consequences, and when he did,

01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:14.400
it was probably too late. But that's not necessarily a one-way street.

01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:27.600
A lot of public drama on this scale happens because one party decides that actually, they don't want to

01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:32.080
talk it out privately, they want to go nuclear, they want to call someone else. Now, Stephen's

01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:37.200
video isn't your typical call-out post, it doesn't seem tailor-made to be a channel-ending video,

01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:42.640
but I think its impact spoke volumes to how people viewed him as a part of the channel. However, with

01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:47.840
the whole future of the channel in jeopardy, was it worth it, and was it the right thing to do?

01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:52.000
In Daniel's response video, he posts various conversations between himself and Stephen.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:56.640
The relevant conversation showed the aftermath of Stephen's private departure from the channel.

01:00:56.640 --> 01:01:01.200
Daniel is very attentive after Stephen lists out his personal issues, suggesting twice that they

01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:05.280
meet up, which is something that Daniel himself references in his response video.

01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:10.640
So first things first, before he released that video, I already wanted to talk to him in person,

01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:17.920
in regards to him leaving, I asked him once after he left to meet up, he said he wanted to do an

01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:23.040
a call but we never got in a call, and then later he texted me again and I said, let's please meet

01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:28.400
up, let's have some coffee, but he declined again. Daniel knew there was an issue, he wanted to resolve

01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:33.520
it privately, however, sometimes things shouldn't just be talked about privately, sometimes we do

01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:37.920
need to go public with our grievances to make sure that a person is held to account. There are plenty

01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:42.800
of situations where such a promotion can help other people come forward with their own problems,

01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:47.440
and plenty of times a private conversation with a coercive person can help suppress possible

01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:52.560
consequences facing down a person, and postpone the ultimate confrontation, and maybe make this

01:01:52.560 --> 01:01:58.240
person's abuse of power even worse. Sometimes it can be an intimidation tactic, but it's hard to tell

01:01:58.240 --> 01:02:03.120
with a lot of people, was going public relevant here, especially in the way that Stephen did?

01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:07.360
Let's talk about it. Well, firstly, I think what we have to discuss is why on earth Stephen

01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:12.320
decided not to talk it out in private, in fact, why he never indicated at all that he planned to

01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:17.360
make a video, while still talking to Dan at that time. To many people, such behaviour would seem

01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:22.000
pretty sneaky, and to be honest, they're not inherently wrong. If we discount the idea that he

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:26.560
had malintent, why would he do this? I think the one quote that explains it is here.

01:02:26.560 --> 01:02:36.400
So, do I think there was any way to avoid the situation? No. A heavy hand is only moved by a heavier

01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:41.440
hand. He viewed it as imperative that he do this, but many would argue going off Stephen and Daniel's

01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:45.600
videos that this conflict was clearly avoidable. However, in the streams there are some details

01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:51.200
which I found quite important, such as this. After our fight, Hosuh was still talking to Dan about

01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:59.680
getting money out to other people, to the animators, to me, to everyone else, but Daniel was so stubborn

01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:07.120
and he thinks that his wages are okay. They clearly aren't. I will get into the wage issue

01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:14.480
after, but it was just not, and Hosuh and me were not passive in this.

01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:19.280
Now, Daniel doesn't respond to every stream point, and he doesn't have to, but I am surprised he

01:03:19.280 --> 01:03:23.200
didn't respond to this one, as to me, it's an important detail that could decide whether a

01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:28.800
situation is avoidable or not. Also, I want to briefly mention about Hosuh, because Stephen

01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:35.440
talks about Hosuh. Due to the possible legal implications that may come out affecting Hosuh

01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:41.920
negatively, I'm not going to talk about the transactions and terms we have come to an

01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:47.360
agreement to. It's something that we both have come to an agreement with. That's all I will say.

01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:54.960
Him and I are still good business-wise. It's something that had to happen, and it's something

01:03:54.960 --> 01:04:01.840
that really can't be talked about online. It's a private matter, and that's it.

01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:06.960
He cites legal ramifications in declining to talk about certain details regarding Pay and Hosuh,

01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:11.360
but I don't think the idea that Hosuh was negotiating on behalf of his friends would fall

01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:15.760
under that. Now, for argument's sake, I'm going to assume that Stephen's perspective is the case,

01:04:15.760 --> 01:04:20.960
and that Hosuh was indeed attempting to negotiate with Dan, and that Dan rebuffed these negotiations

01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:25.360
and showed no intention to alter Pay. Essentially, at the end of these failed negotiations,

01:04:25.360 --> 01:04:29.760
Stephen receives the impression that there is nothing he can say or do to receive a little more

01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:35.280
respect. Hosuh was fighting for more Pay, that did not occur. They exhausted every option privately.

01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:39.600
So that's the first half of whether a situation is worth going public about, but what about the

01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:44.160
second? Well, I think this is the key one, and it may explain why he lied about jumping into a call

01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:48.320
regarding Disneyland, and why he didn't bring anything up prior to the video, and that is

01:04:48.320 --> 01:05:17.680
manipulation.

01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:21.920
Stephen clearly had the expectation that if he had brought it up with Dan, Dan would be able to

01:05:21.920 --> 01:05:26.400
talk Stephen out of it. This is a problem of perspective, because in Dan's mind, he would have

01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:31.040
had the opportunity to persuade Stephen with his numerous facts and logic, and in Stephen's mind,

01:05:31.040 --> 01:05:35.840
Dan would manipulate him into a position where he doesn't speak up and his story isn't told.

01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:40.880
Which perspective is true? Well, it really depends on what happened specifically behind the scenes,

01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:45.840
details that haven't really been admitted or conceded by either side. Stephen speculated,

01:05:45.840 --> 01:05:50.720
and Daniel dodged, neither of which are conclusive. I guess it made sense in Stephen's

01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:54.800
head what he was doing, and like Daniel, he probably didn't consider all the consequences of

01:05:54.800 --> 01:05:59.040
not confronting it and diving head first in the video, and it's hard to say that what's happened

01:05:59.040 --> 01:06:03.200
to Daniel specifically and DanPlan is completely justified.

01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:08.400
After Daniel posts his video, I want to sit down with him and actually talk things out.

01:06:09.360 --> 01:06:13.760
I do truly want to resolve this, because there are still people working on DanPlan

01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:18.080
who are being mistreated, and I don't want that to happen to them.

01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:25.520
So yeah, I want to resolve this. Not for my sake, because I honestly don't want his money anymore.

01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:30.480
He does seem quite torn on his own feelings regarding Daniel,

01:06:30.480 --> 01:06:34.880
and he may well have been questioning whether he did the right thing. It's a good question.

01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:40.400
Was undermining the image of a friend and his channel once to even help build a justified

01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:44.800
response to the perception of an injustice perpetrated by a colleague, one that did not

01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:49.280
seem like it was going to resolve itself otherwise? Maybe not, but what would the middle

01:06:49.280 --> 01:06:53.280
ground have been? I think that's the question for discussion today. It's just a shame that Stephen

01:06:53.280 --> 01:06:57.600
did have such a cynical perception of Dan, to believe that every message with a smiley face,

01:06:57.600 --> 01:07:02.400
every trip posted onto YouTube had some ulterior motive. This wasn't helped when Jay said in his

01:07:02.400 --> 01:07:06.720
video that he felt like Dan only messaged him when he had something to gain. It brings into

01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:11.840
question all the niceties. Being nice doesn't make you a good person, and some people can be awfully

01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:16.000
friendly while twisting the knife in other aspects. And that's how Stephen saw Daniel,

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:21.360
a shining smile with teeth of daggers, and Stephen decided to take it down. By doing this,

01:07:21.360 --> 01:07:25.920
Stephen also broke a prospective agreement that he made with Dan, which was to wait out his position

01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:30.080
until Hosuh had left the channel. This was detailed in Daniel's video again.

01:07:30.080 --> 01:07:36.080
Nevertheless, I still compensate Stephen for each video that he's in. And that was the agreement

01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:43.200
that we made. My side of the agreement was that we try and get past this. And on top of that,

01:07:43.760 --> 01:07:49.680
that because Hosuh is leaving for military and we both knew at the time, I wanted the channel and

01:07:49.680 --> 01:07:56.800
the community to be still the same when he came back. So I wanted Stephen to stay at least until

01:07:56.800 --> 01:08:02.160
then and we can figure something out from there on. Even the day when he left the channel,

01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:09.360
December 15th or 16th, I supported him. I told him that it was upsetting that he was leaving

01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:14.000
and that even though he is breaking his end of the deal, I won't break my end of the deal.

01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:21.040
And that I want us to transition through this smoothly and I want him to succeed in his own

01:08:21.040 --> 01:08:26.640
pursuits and in his chapter and in his channel. Now I must say I find it strange that moving past

01:08:26.640 --> 01:08:32.160
an argument would be included in a deal. Feelings like that cannot really be defined by the fabric

01:08:32.160 --> 01:08:37.440
of such. I feel that Dan wanted to move on so badly and he just didn't know what else to do but

01:08:37.440 --> 01:08:42.000
put it in a pact. I can understand why Stephen not following through on this may be cause for critique,

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:47.280
however, more on the side that he made the deal in the first place after such a volatile argument,

01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:53.040
one that both sides frame as extremely involved. Now, I would also add that in the DM shown by

01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:57.760
Daniel himself, Stephen seems to contest that this deal was ever made, which gives me the impression

01:08:57.760 --> 01:09:02.160
that it wasn't particularly formal, but let's entertain the idea that this deal is a thing for

01:09:02.160 --> 01:09:06.880
argument's sake. Binding deals are a bad idea unless you both have a similar level of influence

01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:11.040
in that deal, or else one's always going to feel at risk of being taken advantage of. Now, you

01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:15.680
might make a deal like that as a friend, but as Stephen no longer viewed Dan as a friend when he

01:09:15.680 --> 01:09:20.400
broke the deal, he therefore had no reason to commit to it. Deals like those are to be made

01:09:20.400 --> 01:09:25.120
between equals, and Stephen no longer felt like an equal, so he had no reason to honour it.

01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:30.560
Why he made the deal in the first place, I don't know, maybe he felt bad, maybe it was for Hosuh,

01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:36.240
they clearly have a close bond, but whatever it was, it was buried six feet deep by January.

01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:42.720
And even during the first video, which was carefully written and planned and edited,

01:09:53.840 --> 01:10:00.320
he doesn't mention anything about not attacking me, but then posts a community tab later saying,

01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:04.800
oh yeah, don't attack Daniel. Consequences were more severe than most would have anticipated,

01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:09.120
and his mixed feelings did lead to him often swinging back and forth about how he feels

01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:13.600
regarding the outcome. Daniel picks these out and criticises him quite harshly.

01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:19.120
He mentions at the beginning of his live stream, don't attack Dan. I appreciate that,

01:10:19.120 --> 01:10:27.120
I honestly do, but the statement that he makes isn't consistent with what he goes on to say,

01:10:28.080 --> 01:10:32.640
where he says he's using you guys as a weapon, even though he doesn't want to.

01:10:32.640 --> 01:10:38.800
Because Dan didn't give me recognition for one mil, so I'm going to take away his two mil,

01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:45.040
and I find that pretty hilarious. Of course, I am using you guys as a weapon then, so if you want

01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:52.320
to unsubscribe, by all means, go ahead. If you want to keep being subscribed, by all means, go ahead.

01:10:52.320 --> 01:10:56.000
Or to unsubscribe, if they feel like it.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:00.400
However, Daniel's clip of the stream does omit Stephen's then sudden pivot back to

01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:03.760
reasonability and recognition that this would be a bad idea.

01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:08.960
If you want to unsubscribe, by all means, go ahead. If you want to keep being subscribed,

01:11:09.520 --> 01:11:16.400
by all means, go ahead. I don't want to use you guys as a weapon, that's so cowardly on my part.

01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:21.360
So I would never say do or don't, do something.

01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:25.680
As said, streaming brings out a spontaneity of people that can be fundamentally emotional

01:11:25.680 --> 01:11:30.160
and bitter, and this is clearly an emotional topic. You have to take that into consideration

01:11:30.160 --> 01:11:33.360
when making your arguments, but unfortunately, both of these people

01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:37.760
didn't see the intent in the other side. This was a personal battle that Stephen fought,

01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:43.280
but by the stream and Jay's video, it became a greater question about another oppressed minority,

01:11:43.280 --> 01:11:46.240
and I'm not talking about gamers. Who was it then?

01:11:46.240 --> 01:12:01.440
To an extent, both parties could have been more proactive, but as the guy in charge of the channel,

01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:06.400
Daniel did make a real mistake by treating someone who is part of the brand as a part-time rep,

01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:08.240
financially or personally.

01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:16.000
Now this doesn't mean I'm not frugal, I grew up poor, I am a cheap person just because of the way

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:23.280
I was raised, I am not insensitive to finances just because I'm now dealing with a larger sum

01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:31.840
of money. Each transaction I'm very careful with, and I am very cautious in making those transactions.

01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:36.800
Now in his response video, Daniel does admit he has a tendency to be cheap, and I think that's fine.

01:12:36.800 --> 01:12:41.440
It's good that he's being open about it, some openness will hopefully have improvement in the future,

01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:45.440
however, he does dedicate a significant proportion of the video to the animators.

01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:50.480
The animators and just crew in general, I feel super bad for dragging them into this,

01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:56.320
because in my head, one of the scenarios that could play out is literally him just burning

01:12:56.320 --> 01:13:03.440
the entire channel to the ground, letting it die, and then leaving all the animators and crew in

01:13:03.440 --> 01:13:11.600
general to do nothing, because this is a job for them. First and foremost, I've already apologized

01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:18.480
to them privately, but I want to apologize again. I am sorry that all of you are caught up in this.

01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:25.680
It's not your problem that Stephen and I had a spat, and it's not your problem that we are

01:13:25.680 --> 01:13:32.400
taking this out in publicly. You should not be involved in this. I know it's not just stress for

01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:40.000
me, but for you all as well, and I am so so so sorry that you're involved in this. Now the animators

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:44.400
are a pretty sacred talking point, they're this mystical third party who neither side can

01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:48.720
necessarily lay claim to, so each faction definitely panders to the narrative that works

01:13:48.720 --> 01:13:53.520
best for them, while leaving out a few relevant details. Now, animators are not at the forefront

01:13:53.520 --> 01:13:57.760
of the channel, but they do provide a significant contribution, and it is accepted that they would

01:13:57.760 --> 01:14:02.640
be paid for such a contribution. After Stephen's video, there were rumblings about the status of

01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:07.040
animators, and if they'd experienced a similar side of Daniel's behaviour, be that his treatment

01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:13.440
of them, or his payment. The more I dove into it, the more I realized how many more people were

01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:19.120
being screwed. This is not just a me problem anymore. When I started digging, I started asking

01:14:19.120 --> 01:14:24.640
the animators, how much were you getting paid? And the answers kept being the same, about $450

01:14:24.640 --> 01:14:31.520
per month. For a month of work, they get $450, and it's not even consistent, because sometimes

01:14:31.520 --> 01:14:37.920
it takes more than a month to make a video, but you still get $450. $450, let's say $450,

01:14:37.920 --> 01:14:46.240
just to be generous, for a month's work. That is insane. If my boss was paying me $450 for working

01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:51.280
full-time, I'd quit the job. The word full-time was thrown around a lot. Part-time was mentioned

01:14:51.280 --> 01:14:56.160
too, but the main allegations came from how he treated his quote, full-time animators.

01:14:56.160 --> 01:15:04.000
What it means to work for a company full-time, is that you are implying that I will work for you

01:15:04.640 --> 01:15:12.160
for this amount of set of hours, consistently, and I am trusting this company to give me financial

01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:19.360
stability of my work. So basically, I will ensure that I give you my full-time of work,

01:15:20.320 --> 01:15:30.240
and in return, I want a consistent, safe, monetary, like, reciprocation. I give you work,

01:15:30.240 --> 01:15:37.840
you give me money. That is not the case. There is very, very, very little difference between

01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:43.520
part-time animators and full-time animators. The full-time maybe get paid a little bit more,

01:15:43.520 --> 01:15:50.240
who knows, but as far as I can tell, it's still inconsistent, it's still grossly underpaid,

01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:56.160
and there's almost no benefits. Daniel has essentially trapped any animator

01:15:56.720 --> 01:16:00.960
who actually wants to make a living just by paying them like slave wages,

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:07.200
while still making them work full-time. Now full-time is quite a loaded word in western

01:16:07.200 --> 01:16:11.280
society. It generally refers to a person who works a set amount of hours and obtains their

01:16:11.280 --> 01:16:16.800
primary source of income from that job. The figure that was also thrown around was $450 a

01:16:16.800 --> 01:16:21.440
month, although they state that payment was inconsistent as a ballpark figure for a full-time

01:16:21.440 --> 01:16:25.760
job. Anyone will tell you that is unacceptable, and if Dan Plan was doing that, then he should

01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:30.000
be called out. However, he contests this immediately, and shows receipts to back it up.

01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:37.280
I don't make them sign anything, and if I were to have hired them full-time to make them sign

01:16:37.280 --> 01:16:44.000
something where they can't get out and then not pay them properly, that's illegal.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:49.440
First of all, they don't sign anything. It's a verbal agreement, and it's second of all,

01:16:49.440 --> 01:16:55.680
not a full-time employment. No one has mentioned this, and I don't know why. They are what is

01:16:55.680 --> 01:17:02.000
called subcontractors. They are contractors. That is what the type of job that they have.

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:08.240
They do a contracted job for a project. In this case, it's a video, and it's completely different

01:17:08.240 --> 01:17:15.360
from a wage-based job. They do their own work as their own entity, and on the project that we

01:17:15.360 --> 01:17:24.160
request, we both agree on a price. When we mutually agree on the price, they then work on the video

01:17:24.160 --> 01:17:32.080
itself. People keep on bringing up full-time or part-time or whatever. It just doesn't make any

01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:39.520
sense, and that is not the type of agreement that I have with the animators. If I were to hire

01:17:39.520 --> 01:17:45.440
somebody in a different manner, that would be a different story, but this isn't that case. When

01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:53.920
I interview them, I always ask how much they want to be paid per video, and Stephen says that they

01:17:53.920 --> 01:17:58.880
come into this job without knowing anything. Now, subcontractual work is completely different,

01:17:58.880 --> 01:18:03.040
because you're paying for the completion of a job. You don't know how many hours they're working or

01:18:03.040 --> 01:18:07.200
how consistently they're working. You have a job, you have a deadline, and you hope it's done in

01:18:07.200 --> 01:18:11.920
time. I must admit, I find it strange that as a person providing a recurrent job on a regular

01:18:11.920 --> 01:18:16.800
basis, he doesn't have a set price in his head, and asks animators what they want to be paid.

01:18:16.800 --> 01:18:21.200
Daniel is an established creator with a lot of influence, and an animator who will want to be

01:18:21.200 --> 01:18:25.520
hired for future jobs may lure their prices for competitiveness. If it was a one-off job,

01:18:25.520 --> 01:18:29.040
or a field that he was inexperienced in, it would make more sense.

01:18:29.040 --> 01:18:33.760
And I thought that if they weren't happy with it, they could always talk to me, because I was

01:18:34.400 --> 01:18:42.800
approachable to them. It doesn't excuse the fact that I am in the position that I'm in,

01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:52.560
which means that since I am the boss or a YouTuber, that because of who I am,

01:18:52.560 --> 01:18:58.000
and the relationship that I have with them, and the business point of view, that it is

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:06.240
harder to approach me, no matter what I do. And if that is what the audience felt,

01:19:06.240 --> 01:19:13.360
and if that's what the animators felt, I sincerely apologize. I am sorry.

01:19:13.360 --> 01:19:17.760
Now, Dan does admit that he made a mistake by not being more proactive in the video,

01:19:17.760 --> 01:19:22.320
I do appreciate that, and there are many subcontractors who do have their own pre-established

01:19:22.320 --> 01:19:28.240
prices, however, it's hard to apply that without a clear amount of work for a video established.

01:19:28.240 --> 01:19:34.160
Nonetheless, it is just a side point, and I will digress. Does this mean he was paying good price?

01:19:34.160 --> 01:19:39.200
Not really. I'm not an animator myself, I did briefly speak to an animator involved who felt

01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:43.280
that given the work per frame and the consideration that the animator storyboarded

01:19:43.280 --> 01:19:48.160
the videos to, this payment was not sufficient in comparison to the other work they have been doing

01:19:48.160 --> 01:19:53.440
since DanPlan. It also depends on the amount of negotiation that occurred prior, and as went over

01:19:53.440 --> 01:19:57.840
earlier, we're not really receiving a clear narrative on that front. On top of this, in Jay's

01:19:57.840 --> 01:20:03.680
video, he also references Hosuh, who is an animator himself, and his opinion on how much the animators

01:20:03.680 --> 01:20:04.800
should be paid.

01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:10.000
Hosuh- This is coming from Hosuh directly. In Hosuh's opinion, the videos created by the animators

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:13.840
are worth at least $1500 Canadian per video.

01:20:13.840 --> 01:20:17.760
Now, this is not coming from Hosuh directly, but Hosuh hasn't challenged it either,

01:20:17.760 --> 01:20:22.480
and has since worked with Jay. That doesn't exactly prove he said it, but it's another relevant nugget

01:20:22.480 --> 01:20:27.680
of information to consider regardless. Unfortunately, in this situation, the receipts were rather low.

01:20:27.680 --> 01:20:31.360
Some question whether the animators could have gone on strike, but unfortunately, if they viewed

01:20:31.360 --> 01:20:35.440
their roles expendable given the high turnover of staff, then Dan could have just sacked them.

01:20:35.440 --> 01:20:39.440
If they weren't really that much of a community, then it would have been even harder to organise.

01:20:39.440 --> 01:20:43.280
Of course, this begs the question of why this was not raised more when Hosuh was supposedly

01:20:43.280 --> 01:20:48.480
negotiating or Jay investigating. Well, probably because no party wanted to initiate civil war with

01:20:48.480 --> 01:20:52.560
the hope that it would improve, but problems seldom disappear without confrontation, or else

01:20:52.560 --> 01:20:56.560
the person would be ignorant, and although I think Dan was willfully ignorant to an extent,

01:20:56.560 --> 01:21:01.200
I think the animator issue here was probably a collateral outcome of the drama which could have

01:21:01.200 --> 01:21:05.840
been avoided in hindsight. There are also claims after Daniel's video that he had cherry picked

01:21:05.840 --> 01:21:10.480
examples that supported his case, and this may be somewhat true, but unfortunately, there's not

01:21:10.480 --> 01:21:15.360
too much that can be done at this point, you'd need evidence of the contrary, simple ads.

01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:22.000
It's not fair to the animators that are coming on with zero knowledge and essentially being put

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:28.880
into an assembly line factory. Again, how would he know he hasn't joined in a single interview?

01:21:28.880 --> 01:21:33.760
What I do during the interview Steven has never been part of, so for him to just assume that they

01:21:33.760 --> 01:21:40.240
don't know anything when they come in is a lie. I explain in full detail what they will be doing.

01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:46.160
I tell them that this isn't an easy job. I tell them that it may take a long time.

01:21:46.160 --> 01:21:50.960
I tell them that the type of employment is a subcontractor work, which means I pay them

01:21:50.960 --> 01:21:56.240
poor for the video, not for the amount of time. Contractor job is a real thing,

01:21:56.240 --> 01:22:02.960
and anyone that knows business would know what I'm talking about. I obviously don't know a lot of

01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:08.480
different size of different businesses, but it's one of the things that you're allowed to do

01:22:09.200 --> 01:22:14.800
when you want to hire somebody for a job. Now the pay also depends on the length of the video,

01:22:14.800 --> 01:22:20.640
the amount of videos that we have some contracted out to, and the quality of the project,

01:22:20.640 --> 01:22:28.240
because afterwards I try to tip them more than what we pre-agreed on. If they weren't happy with

01:22:28.240 --> 01:22:34.720
the pay, they can talk to me. Because there has been times where, you know, we would discuss

01:22:35.280 --> 01:22:39.840
me and an animator, hey, do you think this is good enough? And they tell me, I don't know,

01:22:39.840 --> 01:22:44.320
do you think it's good enough? And we come to an agreement, and if they aren't happy with it,

01:22:44.320 --> 01:22:48.480
we can meet somewhere in the middle. Although Daniel claimed that there was no way that Steven

01:22:48.480 --> 01:22:53.120
would know such details listed in the live stream as incriminating, as we know, Jay on the other

01:22:53.120 --> 01:22:57.600
hand claimed to have sat in interviews regarding prospective animators with Dan, and made some

01:22:57.600 --> 01:23:02.080
pretty strong claims himself, likely the ones that may have been repeated in Steven's streams.

01:23:02.080 --> 01:23:06.720
Steven's comments are likely a case of fired up individuals and Chinese whispers. I think it

01:23:06.720 --> 01:23:11.280
probably is an exaggerated image, but that's what happens when you try and tackle a subject that

01:23:11.280 --> 01:23:16.960
you feel strongly about on stream based on other people's comments. Again, I can't show texts or

01:23:16.960 --> 01:23:24.640
messages, but trust me when I say that I have tried always my best to be considerate to the

01:23:24.640 --> 01:23:31.440
animators. I've always tried to be kind and gentle and compassionate about their personal lives,

01:23:31.440 --> 01:23:36.720
and not only that, but be understanding if they're delayed. Doesn't mean I was never

01:23:36.720 --> 01:23:43.920
frustrated. Anyone who works with anyone are sometimes frustrated, but I tried my best to

01:23:43.920 --> 01:23:51.520
care for them first before I care about this business or posting a video. When I ask them

01:23:51.520 --> 01:23:57.360
and they ignore me, I even continue to say and worry about their well-being before the video

01:23:57.360 --> 01:24:04.880
itself. I ask them how they're doing first before I continue and ask about how the videos are coming

01:24:04.880 --> 01:24:12.000
along. The only time I would have a conversation about if they're too delayed or if there's

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:18.400
something wrong is if there is something seriously wrong or they're months and months late and I have

01:24:18.400 --> 01:24:24.400
to have a conversation just to see if everything's okay. And even then it's not an aggressive call,

01:24:24.400 --> 01:24:30.960
I just ask how they're doing and that I understand that personal lives do interfere

01:24:30.960 --> 01:24:37.520
with finishing on deadlines. This is not because I'm like a great person, it's because I just

01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:46.080
know what it's like to be on the other side of a relationship when it comes to like a boss figure,

01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:52.640
I guess, and I didn't want to be one of those people that yelled or intimidated their co-workers

01:24:52.640 --> 01:25:00.720
or the people they worked with. I at least think, to the best of my knowledge,

01:25:02.480 --> 01:25:07.920
try to be kind and gentle with the animators. There are two dramatically different perspectives

01:25:07.920 --> 01:25:12.800
here, but they're not completely incompatible, although they are somewhat. Dan may have been a

01:25:12.800 --> 01:25:16.560
lovely person to talk to, may have checked in with people about how they were doing, may have

01:25:16.560 --> 01:25:20.400
been accepting when they were late. That doesn't mean he pays them well, nor does it mean they

01:25:20.400 --> 01:25:25.040
weren't afraid to speak out due to the possibility of their pay being affected. Admittedly, now the

01:25:25.040 --> 01:25:28.960
channel has been declared deceased by various people, there isn't really much at stake, so

01:25:28.960 --> 01:25:34.000
that point is kinda moot. But for the animators who did speak up, what did they actually say?

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:38.320
Well, once again, it becomes quite complicated. There was a YouTuber named Snazzle who was quite

01:25:38.320 --> 01:25:42.160
a vocal critic of Daniel, calling him out left, right and centre for his behaviour.

01:25:42.800 --> 01:25:50.320
What are you doing, Dan? What are you doing, man? This is disgusting. Please, please come out and

01:25:50.320 --> 01:25:55.520
say something. Please apologise. Please let people know you can change at least a little, please.

01:25:56.080 --> 01:26:02.160
There has to be some humanity in you. This can't happen. You have to see now that this is wrong.

01:26:02.720 --> 01:26:09.600
There has to be some fundamental click going on in your mind that says, hey, this is wrong.

01:26:09.600 --> 01:26:13.600
I'm doing something wrong. Everyone's telling me I'm doing something wrong, but I'm not seeing it.

01:26:13.600 --> 01:26:19.840
Why am I not seeing it? Why can't I not see it? Where is that at, Dan? Where's the click? I don't

01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:25.680
get it from you. None of this makes any sense. How could you be at this right now? How could this

01:26:25.680 --> 01:26:31.360
level of incompetency happen? How could you be so impudent as to not pay for your staff to get what

01:26:31.360 --> 01:26:36.320
they need? Those people care so much about your channel, obviously more than you do, and you take

01:26:36.320 --> 01:26:42.320
all the credit, all the money. That is insane. After Steven streamed and Jay spoke about this

01:26:42.320 --> 01:26:46.480
narrative, the animator point became more prominent, and Snazzle became more involved.

01:26:46.480 --> 01:26:50.480
He posted this on Discord, claiming to have spoken to the animators, and it had moved him to the

01:26:50.480 --> 01:26:56.160
point of tears. Sobering stuff. So what did he do? Well, Snazzle conducted a charity livestream,

01:26:56.160 --> 01:27:00.960
raising over $4,000 for these animators. A couple of these animators were involved themselves,

01:27:00.960 --> 01:27:04.240
though I don't think they spoke about the specific drama. I feel if they did,

01:27:04.240 --> 01:27:08.080
the clips would have been used elsewhere, even though the stream is no longer accessible.

01:27:08.080 --> 01:27:12.560
Regardless, this was an extraordinary success for the animators and their advocates, but there was

01:27:12.560 --> 01:27:17.520
more to come. And when I say that, I mean, well, Daniel's video. Dan obviously disputed these claims,

01:27:17.520 --> 01:27:21.600
showed corresponding evidence, and although he didn't directly respond to the claims made by

01:27:21.600 --> 01:27:26.560
Snazzle and Jay, his story generally contradicted the image that his treatment of the animators

01:27:26.560 --> 01:27:31.280
would bring a tear to one's eye. So some became quite confused, and asked questions about the

01:27:31.280 --> 01:27:35.920
original claims against Daniel. What were the responses? Well...

01:27:35.920 --> 01:27:42.240
Daniel- As much as I want to explain the situation to people, as much as I know how much, you know,

01:27:43.040 --> 01:27:49.680
how much people want the information, the information that I have, I just can't do it.

01:27:50.720 --> 01:27:57.520
I can't sit here and justify giving out that when I know how many people will be hurt,

01:27:57.840 --> 01:27:58.800
just because I do that.

01:27:58.800 --> 01:28:02.560
This was frustrating, and it left a lot of people with unanswered questions.

01:28:10.240 --> 01:28:14.800
Dan's response wasn't the best. There were clear logical flaws, statements that conveyed a rather

01:28:14.800 --> 01:28:19.280
self-righteous sentiment, arguments that were too irrelevant, and details left out. But after the

01:28:19.280 --> 01:28:24.400
video, there were very few responses too, and those that were uploaded were very inconclusive.

01:28:24.400 --> 01:28:29.360
Lest it be reminded, Dan was the only person to provide actual evidence, and that evidence

01:28:29.360 --> 01:28:33.520
may not have definitively disproved all the narratives against him, but it was enough in

01:28:33.520 --> 01:28:34.400
certain terms.

01:28:54.400 --> 01:29:09.520
After some ran such a strong narrative on the basis of the animators, and raising thousands

01:29:09.520 --> 01:29:13.600
of dollars for them, people wanted to feel like this narrative was actually justified,

01:29:13.600 --> 01:29:16.880
and the fact that people decided to hold back was understandably frustrating.

01:29:24.400 --> 01:29:42.080
Some people compared this response to Jeffree Star, and I understand why. It was the sudden

01:29:42.080 --> 01:29:46.880
decision to end the drama immediately after a conflicting viewpoint and evidence came out,

01:29:46.880 --> 01:29:52.000
and framing it as the right thing to do. People never liked that, it seems disingenuous. They

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:56.720
also don't like being told when it's time to stop the discussion, they'll decide when to stop being

01:29:56.720 --> 01:30:00.880
interested in it, thank you very much. Snazzle did state he was doing it for the animators,

01:30:00.880 --> 01:30:05.440
and I do not doubt that many of them probably did want the drama to end, but it's likely worth

01:30:05.440 --> 01:30:09.680
considering that a bit earlier on in the situation when you're dogmatically preaching over your

01:30:09.680 --> 01:30:14.000
microphone. I also don't want to dispute that there's a real moralistic case for the disclosure

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:18.080
of more information, and justification of the money raised off people who assume the premise

01:30:18.080 --> 01:30:23.120
to be true, and the handling is definitely subpar, but it is what it is. They raised a lot of money

01:30:23.120 --> 01:30:27.440
following the end of By The Way, and they did say they would be working with the animators to find

01:30:27.440 --> 01:30:32.880
them new work, not that the animators need that. However, I'd be lying if I said the situation

01:30:32.880 --> 01:30:37.360
didn't leave a bitter taste in my mouth given the strength and passion prior, I just hope some

01:30:37.360 --> 01:30:40.560
people take it as a learning experience going forward.

01:30:40.560 --> 01:30:47.360
Daniel has essentially trapped any animator who actually wants to make a living just by paying them like slave wages,

01:30:47.360 --> 01:30:49.760
while still making them work full time.

01:30:49.760 --> 01:30:57.520
If this was true, I need to be sued. This is not true, and the fact that he said this

01:30:57.520 --> 01:31:01.680
is a defamation towards not just me, but the company.

01:31:01.680 --> 01:31:05.520
Now, Daniel does sound a bit silly when he talks about defamation against the company,

01:31:05.520 --> 01:31:09.520
but equally, these strong sentiments are why people have probably interpreted it with a bit

01:31:09.520 --> 01:31:13.920
more of an open mind. If Daniel was straight up lying about details, it seems possible to

01:31:13.920 --> 01:31:17.520
audience members that someone probably would have at least provided factual evidence to the

01:31:17.520 --> 01:31:22.240
contrary. Now, you can 100% believe the idea that there may be some reasons that these people don't

01:31:22.240 --> 01:31:27.600
want the drama. These people are not the same as Jeffree Star, and the likes who thrive off it.

01:31:27.600 --> 01:31:28.640
In the words of Steven,

01:31:28.640 --> 01:31:33.280
Do I plan on posting another reply video afterwards? No. Once I know that Daniel has seen

01:31:33.280 --> 01:31:39.920
my stuff, I want to talk to him privately. We're not going to do that, like, avocado person.

01:31:39.920 --> 01:31:45.040
What do I think? I think it's fair to say the main individuals involved probably didn't want

01:31:45.040 --> 01:31:50.720
this huge conflict. Steven wanted to be recognised, and Daniel had a reason to reply. Both felt

01:31:50.720 --> 01:31:55.280
inclined to make public statements for what they believe was just, and although, as noted,

01:31:55.280 --> 01:31:59.520
certain comments were probably overkill, it's what cynicism does to people. What about other

01:31:59.520 --> 01:32:04.480
people's motives? Well, I'm not so sure. Jay was another character who had a right to comment in

01:32:04.480 --> 01:32:08.640
what definitely formed a case against Daniel, and the animator issue was one of the blind spots

01:32:08.640 --> 01:32:13.360
where Daniel didn't provide any screenshots other than regarding pay. As I noted earlier,

01:32:13.360 --> 01:32:17.920
the fact that he had no DMs to show whatsoever was pretty unconvincing. On top of this,

01:32:17.920 --> 01:32:22.880
Jay claimed he had DMs of his own to release, as he felt his credibility was challenged.

01:32:22.880 --> 01:32:27.120
Again, these DMs never saw the light of day, whether the animators urged him not to as he

01:32:27.120 --> 01:32:32.000
says in DMs, or if the DMs never existed, is something you'll have to decide for both sides.

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:36.000
I personally feel that, because it was the case for both sides, probably meant there was an

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:40.880
element of animator reservation, and sometimes silence can be equally as telling as speaking up.

01:32:40.880 --> 01:32:44.880
People were probably conflicted about their feelings regarding Daniel. Was he nice for the

01:32:44.880 --> 01:32:48.880
right reasons, or was he just massaging the product? Was he intimidating, or were they

01:32:48.880 --> 01:32:54.000
intimidated? I doubt you'd see Dan going around spontaneously abusing people, so I assume the

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:58.720
evidence was a bit more subtle, and maybe people had cold feet about that. As mentioned, I had also

01:32:58.720 --> 01:33:03.920
spoken to an animator involved, and that was the impression I received too, a lot of conflicted

01:33:03.920 --> 01:33:08.880
feelings in spite of criticism. Steven stuck by his guns following the video, though also

01:33:08.880 --> 01:33:13.040
sticking by his word that he doesn't seek to make another. He's posted a few more statements here

01:33:13.040 --> 01:33:17.280
and there that have been pretty consistent, mainly about the point regarding animators, and obviously

01:33:17.280 --> 01:33:21.680
why he wanted to speak about it. It seems that any of Steven's conflicted feelings prior to Dan's

01:33:21.680 --> 01:33:26.640
video have gone out the window, which I think has disappointed fans further, but in a situation like

01:33:26.640 --> 01:33:31.360
this, there's no point in faking something that doesn't exist. Jay's video was since removed,

01:33:31.360 --> 01:33:35.040
and Jay has since deleted his presence from the internet, presumably because of certain

01:33:35.040 --> 01:33:39.520
allegations surrounding various inappropriate sexual behaviour, including grooming, which

01:33:39.520 --> 01:33:44.080
I just want to escape at this point. He did post a response, denying these fairly vehemently though,

01:33:44.080 --> 01:33:47.840
as most of the screenshots and the document that held them are now gone, it's hard for me to really

01:33:47.840 --> 01:33:52.960
provide a balanced opinion. As a minor caveat, I did find one of the documents. I'm still kinda

01:33:52.960 --> 01:33:59.040
confused, Jay's been up to some comradery, I'm not sure if it's as incriminating as implied.

01:33:59.040 --> 01:34:03.120
Regardless, I'll leave them in the reference document in case anyone wants to try and make

01:34:03.120 --> 01:34:07.920
sense of them. I won't add too much more, other than his exit doesn't appear to have been motivated

01:34:07.920 --> 01:34:12.960
by the DanPlan situation specifically. Does this compromise his credibility? Not necessarily,

01:34:12.960 --> 01:34:16.880
unless you feel there's an element of deceit, or similar traits, in his behaviour which may

01:34:16.880 --> 01:34:21.520
be transferrable. As such, it's hard to comment. Jay's side was just perspective, and although it

01:34:21.520 --> 01:34:26.320
was important, there are other more important points to take away. When we reflect on DanPlan,

01:34:26.320 --> 01:34:30.320
there is a significant lack of evidence that answers people's questions. A lot of questions

01:34:30.320 --> 01:34:35.840
about people's characters and so on, especially the accusations, for example, is Daniel manipulative?

01:34:35.840 --> 01:34:41.040
Maybe. These DMs that he posted in his own video do seem strangely worded. Amongst other things,

01:34:41.040 --> 01:34:46.720
one statement that always stuck out to me said, I treated you so much better. This one always rubbed

01:34:46.720 --> 01:34:51.120
me the wrong way, because who the hell says that if they're not trying to manipulate you? Of course,

01:34:51.120 --> 01:34:55.520
that's not an argument of positivity, he may just hold himself in higher regard, and it would be

01:34:55.920 --> 01:35:00.480
transparent, and thus it's not conclusive. But it's a really weird thing to say to someone,

01:35:00.480 --> 01:35:04.640
even someone whom you have treated well. A lot of other comments, I can see why they would be

01:35:04.640 --> 01:35:09.280
manipulative, but I can also see why they may not be. You have to ask yourself, could a rational

01:35:09.280 --> 01:35:13.520
person reply this way? For a lot of the comments, my answer was yes, so you can't jump to the

01:35:13.520 --> 01:35:17.600
conclusion that someone is malicious just because they say something that could be manipulative.

01:35:17.600 --> 01:35:21.120
It's true that Daniel could just say certain things in an attempt to butter others up to

01:35:21.120 --> 01:35:25.280
stop them from speaking out if he knows they might make a video, but it's also something he might say

01:35:25.280 --> 01:35:29.680
if he genuinely wants to remain friends. It's about how you know Daniel, and I don't know him

01:35:29.680 --> 01:35:33.680
well enough to make that judgement, though I will provide my opinion very soon. Other questions

01:35:33.680 --> 01:35:37.680
about contradictions, such as Stephen saying there's a long negotiation phase, and Daniel

01:35:37.680 --> 01:35:42.880
framing it as if he just came back and accepted $100 per video, seeming conclusive. Some DMs show

01:35:42.880 --> 01:35:47.280
that Dan was nice to Stephen at points, but what that niceness represents, we cannot be sure.

01:35:47.280 --> 01:35:52.880
Was Stephen's video the only option? Was other people's treatment at stake? And was it worth it?

01:35:52.880 --> 01:35:56.960
The truth is, you can't really answer these questions with what we've been given,

01:35:56.960 --> 01:36:00.240
but I do think there are some things you can take from the situation.

01:36:10.400 --> 01:36:14.000
One of the more unfair statements that Daniel made in his video was this one.

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:20.640
Stephen says that he's worried that they'll be jobless from this. If he really thought this,

01:36:22.800 --> 01:36:28.480
he would not have made that video when he did, because when he quit we had a conversation,

01:36:28.480 --> 01:36:34.480
and in the conversation I told him that there's a lot of videos in progress that he is in,

01:36:34.480 --> 01:36:40.640
and that we're in the progress of making them, so I will be announcing that he is leaving after

01:36:40.640 --> 01:36:45.360
those videos are posted. This was for the sake of the animators that are working hard to make

01:36:45.360 --> 01:36:50.800
these videos complete, and he understood that it might take a while. But regardless, he made a

01:36:50.800 --> 01:36:58.960
video two weeks after he quit, and so now we can't post the videos that he is in. They were all still

01:36:58.960 --> 01:37:06.000
working in progress, and now they will never see the light of day because of the actions that he

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:11.920
took. Of course, I'll be paying the animators full amount that we pre-agreed on, even if they

01:37:11.920 --> 01:37:16.800
didn't finish the video. It's not their fault. We can't post these videos, and I still want to

01:37:16.800 --> 01:37:21.600
compensate them with the agreed amount that we made, and I'll ask them if the amount is okay

01:37:21.600 --> 01:37:28.560
again, and if they're not, then we'll meet somewhere. But that's not the important part.

01:37:28.560 --> 01:37:35.200
The important part is that what they made will never see the light of day because Stephen decided

01:37:35.200 --> 01:37:41.360
to make the video so quickly, even though he knew we were still in progress of making

01:37:41.360 --> 01:37:42.880
many videos that he was in.

01:37:42.880 --> 01:37:47.600
Now, this is pretty unreasonable considering Stephen stated that he doesn't mind any videos with

01:37:47.600 --> 01:37:52.560
him being published after his exit. Although I understand why you may not want to release

01:37:52.560 --> 01:37:56.560
previous videos with someone you have bad blood with, that is ultimately your decision as much

01:37:56.560 --> 01:38:01.760
as his was to release the video. It's a shared responsibility. Daniel also does a fair bit of

01:38:01.760 --> 01:38:06.160
paraphrasing here, and if you look at the DMs, all it really shows is Stephen saying he wants

01:38:06.160 --> 01:38:11.280
the videos out as soon as possible rather than having them spaced out, even though he also says

01:38:11.280 --> 01:38:15.440
he's okay with them being published. I think Stephen made his point pretty clear in the

01:38:15.440 --> 01:38:20.080
messages, and Daniel's interpretation is rather uncharitable. The tone it's done in is pretty

01:38:20.080 --> 01:38:24.800
incendiary, and it seems like he's looking for an excuse to end the series there. This didn't have

01:38:24.800 --> 01:38:30.320
to be the series ending video. Dan chose to make this video series ending. It wouldn't have been

01:38:30.400 --> 01:38:35.120
difficult to make a video saying, I'm sorry, I got some things wrong, I probably did underestimate

01:38:35.120 --> 01:38:39.360
the efforts of those around me, but I do feel that people have got my intent wrong, and I'm gonna do

01:38:39.360 --> 01:38:43.760
better to prove it. The DanPlan audience would have been more than happy with a video like that,

01:38:43.760 --> 01:38:49.520
they wanted this situation to heal. Dan chose to kamikaze it by making an equal amount of character

01:38:49.520 --> 01:38:53.760
indicting statements against Stephen. Does that mean he's guilty? Not at all, he may just be

01:38:53.760 --> 01:38:59.600
defending his pride. But pride comes at a cost, and Dan decides to pay the price, and hell, he can

01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:03.280
probably afford it. The amount of money that an audience friendly animation channel will make

01:39:03.280 --> 01:39:08.160
from ad revenue alone is monumental, and then you consider merch and sponsorships, it'll be

01:39:08.160 --> 01:39:12.720
ridiculous. On the other hand, YouTube can be unpredictable, and having all your eggs in that

01:39:12.720 --> 01:39:17.120
basket would probably make you a bit more frugal than some careers would. I understand that,

01:39:17.120 --> 01:39:22.000
and I wanted to empathise with him on the basis of the fact that running a team costing and being

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:26.320
consistent can be a challenge, but at the same time, his self-superior attitude towards it is

01:39:26.320 --> 01:39:31.280
if it's some monumental undertaking that suddenly entitles him to such a mammoth share of the

01:39:31.280 --> 01:39:34.800
channel, it's something that I couldn't personally connect with. It doesn't help that one of the

01:39:34.800 --> 01:39:39.280
other allegations was that he paid some of the manual work a surprisingly low amount.

01:39:39.280 --> 01:39:41.440
It was contradictory logic to many people.

01:39:41.440 --> 01:39:45.840
It's not true. Ever since the company was made at the beginning of last year,

01:39:46.560 --> 01:39:52.480
I have taken zero dollars from the company. This doesn't mean I haven't taken money from the past

01:39:52.480 --> 01:39:56.880
before the company was made. It doesn't mean I won't take money out from the company in the

01:39:56.880 --> 01:40:03.840
future. But I was more invested and reinvesting into the channel and the community, and I was more

01:40:03.840 --> 01:40:13.040
focused on putting the money there. But clearly, it seems like now that I just take all the money

01:40:13.040 --> 01:40:14.720
and run away with it."

01:40:14.720 --> 01:40:18.960
Besides the rather pointless nature of that statement, it doesn't change the fact that

01:40:18.960 --> 01:40:24.080
how much he paid himself wasn't the problem. He could donate it all to charity, and it wouldn't

01:40:24.080 --> 01:40:29.840
change the point. It's proportionately how much was made and how much other people who contributed

01:40:29.840 --> 01:40:35.680
a significant amount to the channel brand saw. Now, regardless of how ridiculous I would consider

01:40:35.680 --> 01:40:41.600
it, I mean, a hundred dollars a video for someone in that position is unbelievable. If both parties

01:40:41.600 --> 01:40:46.720
agree to it, force aside, most people will say that's responsibility taken on by both sides.

01:40:46.720 --> 01:40:51.040
So obviously, there is the question regarding how much negotiation took place, and there's very

01:40:51.040 --> 01:40:55.040
little evidence shown. But regardless of the claims, it makes sense to me that Steven probably

01:40:55.040 --> 01:41:00.560
ended up settling for less due to a motive outside of that which is financial. Daniel is very careful

01:41:00.560 --> 01:41:05.040
in each of his statements, and I don't doubt that he probably has negotiated with artists from time

01:41:05.040 --> 01:41:09.120
to time and come to an agreement, but it doesn't seem implausible that Hosuh may have argued

01:41:09.120 --> 01:41:14.000
generally with Daniel regarding payments and wages too, and I find the use of legality as a reason

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:18.560
not to discuss such to be rather unconvincing. I do receive the impression that Daniel is quite

01:41:18.560 --> 01:41:22.800
headstrong, and I think the fact that he never really recognised the sheer imbalance in that pay

01:41:22.800 --> 01:41:28.080
is a testament to it. If you consider someone more than an employee, then pay them like one. He was

01:41:28.080 --> 01:41:33.120
essentially a contracted guest, and that gave him no loyalty. Daniel was motivated to keep the

01:41:33.120 --> 01:41:38.080
channel structured as it was. I think he did have a bias towards people he viewed as quote originals,

01:41:38.080 --> 01:41:42.720
especially if he gave Hosuh a cut against the dude's own will. He was stubborn, and I wouldn't

01:41:42.720 --> 01:41:47.200
doubt that when confronted, he used the power of his authority to appeal to his sense of business,

01:41:47.200 --> 01:41:52.320
and knowing what's best, which is where this shoutout fan-off style idea came from, maybe from

01:41:52.320 --> 01:41:57.760
the good old gaming days. I don't think Dan uses these ideas to insult people as Jay felt. I

01:41:57.760 --> 01:42:02.160
received the impression it was likely a legitimate passion that he had tunnel vision about. I don't

01:42:02.160 --> 01:42:06.720
think Dan had menacing intentions, he just thought he knew what was best because he was the channel

01:42:06.720 --> 01:42:11.520
owner, and the channel was his, but he failed to realise that the By The Way series brought Stephen

01:42:11.520 --> 01:42:16.000
into the picture, and no amount of side videos, almost all of which underperformed, could really

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:22.560
change that. Stephen isn't business minded, I think he just wanted some more credit, in whatever form.

01:42:22.560 --> 01:42:27.200
Now, there are nuances to this dispute, given it was rooted in a confrontation that both sides

01:42:27.200 --> 01:42:31.280
framed quite differently, and we know it was a volatile argument, and we can say things in the

01:42:31.280 --> 01:42:36.160
heat of the moment. Daniel did apologise for his rage very shortly after it, but the resolution

01:42:36.160 --> 01:42:40.960
was clearly not the end, no deal can help you move past something like that. Daniel may have viewed

01:42:40.960 --> 01:42:45.040
his outburst as a moment of frustration, but Stephen saw it as the slipping of a long war

01:42:45.040 --> 01:42:50.320
masquerade, comments that remain stuck in his head for months to come. By the time he left the channel,

01:42:50.320 --> 01:42:54.960
he had grown bitter, to the extent that he wanted to make Daniel pay, he wanted to be heard, and he

01:42:54.960 --> 01:42:58.800
clearly didn't think he could be heard from the inside. Should he have brought it up with Daniel

01:42:58.800 --> 01:43:05.360
prior? Maybe if he cared about Daniel knowing, but at that point he didn't. Stephen wanted first blood,

01:43:05.440 --> 01:43:06.480
and he got it.

01:43:06.480 --> 01:43:11.840
Stephen- Do I think me and Dan will be friends? Do I have any intentions on being friends again?

01:43:13.680 --> 01:43:18.240
No. I've burned this bridge and I don't intend to rebuild it.

01:43:18.240 --> 01:43:22.320
Now, at this point, Stephen can't really put on the I reached out to Daniel narrative, because he

01:43:22.320 --> 01:43:26.320
can't expect to be treated any differently to how he treated Daniel. There's no honour amongst

01:43:26.320 --> 01:43:30.400
thieves, but before we could even have that discussion, Jay's video left a further dent

01:43:30.400 --> 01:43:34.960
in the already tarnished reputation, it fit in thematically with Stephen's narrative, and provided

01:43:34.960 --> 01:43:39.520
even more detail, some of which would be confirmed by Dan's own video a few days later,

01:43:39.520 --> 01:43:43.920
some of which would be contradicted. Dan's video may have originally been an emotional tell all

01:43:43.920 --> 01:43:48.560
of one side, but by the time the second stream came out, it became a case of who was going to

01:43:48.560 --> 01:43:53.760
scorch the most earth. Daniel's video may have rationalised his perspective, but there was little

01:43:53.760 --> 01:43:58.160
closure, even with the evidence and screenshots, you receive the impression that these two cowboys

01:43:58.160 --> 01:44:02.960
were riding on different wavelengths, and you may find yourself on either. If you are more of a

01:44:02.960 --> 01:44:07.520
classical liberal, you may well have sided with Dan. To some people, I'm sure Dan's deals were

01:44:07.520 --> 01:44:12.240
just business, whether he was a dick to people or not, people consented, and he was part of the

01:44:12.240 --> 01:44:17.440
market, even if the market was flawed, yet you could be the most Machiavellian mortal in existence,

01:44:17.440 --> 01:44:22.960
and still acknowledge that Dan ultimately failed, because he torpedoed his own flagship series in

01:44:22.960 --> 01:44:29.040
the name of pride. The image of Dan Plan was based on something inherently antithetical to how the

01:44:29.040 --> 01:44:34.560
drum portrayed it. A channel always will have some underlying business elements, but if fraternity

01:44:34.560 --> 01:44:39.760
is a selling point, then these videos were just not compatible with it. Dan recently revamped the

01:44:39.760 --> 01:44:44.240
channel to pursue a new direction, one that I think he is more comfortable with, and will probably

01:44:44.240 --> 01:44:48.640
reflect his interests a little more. I wish him the best with that, and maybe he did truly see

01:44:48.640 --> 01:44:53.360
opportunity within the destruction, but as many other creators have found, it is often hard to

01:44:53.360 --> 01:44:58.160
rebrand with an audience who have come to expect something, so I would manage expectations over the

01:44:58.160 --> 01:45:03.280
coming months, and focus on making content that you enjoy, regardless of what other people say.

01:45:03.280 --> 01:45:06.000
Don't go out of your way to justify yourself.

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:10.960
I'm at a state where I have to explain myself for wanting to charity, because I'm so worried that

01:45:10.960 --> 01:45:15.120
people are just going to be like, oh, anything he does now, he's just doing it for his... No,

01:45:15.120 --> 01:45:20.720
I've been doing charity before this drama happened, and I will continue to do charity after this

01:45:20.720 --> 01:45:26.720
drama happened. I don't care what you think of me, alright? This doesn't fix anything. If I was a bad

01:45:26.720 --> 01:45:32.960
person, I am a bad person. If I was a good person, I am a good person. Doing a charity is only good

01:45:32.960 --> 01:45:35.760
because you're doing a charity, everybody should be doing charity. If you can't afford it, don't

01:45:35.760 --> 01:45:41.200
donate, okay? You should protect yourself first, obviously. But if you can afford it, help each other out.

01:45:41.200 --> 01:45:46.320
Two sides hellbent on burning each other down, what we left with? Well, the neutral parties, and they

01:45:46.320 --> 01:45:50.880
told their own story too. We already spoke about the animators who were mostly silent, and reticent

01:45:50.880 --> 01:45:55.600
about releasing any DMs which support either cause. But what about the friends, the amigos?

01:45:55.600 --> 01:45:59.520
What have they said? Well, one of the original members by the name of Anna released a stream

01:45:59.520 --> 01:46:04.480
stating her perspective. I'd say it leans towards Dan's side, and of course, there is a limit within

01:46:04.480 --> 01:46:09.280
that perspective. She definitely sighs towards his corner. If my video doesn't satisfy on its own,

01:46:09.280 --> 01:46:11.440
I'd recommend checking hers out.

01:46:11.440 --> 01:46:19.440
I think his intentions were good, but I think it was a little flawed if you look at it in an overall

01:46:19.440 --> 01:46:25.040
perspective. His intentions weren't bad at all, like I don't think Daniel's intentions were to like,

01:46:25.040 --> 01:46:30.000
oh yeah, I'm just gonna give money to everybody else, and like, not to like my own friends or

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:36.880
whatever. Like, I think his intentions were good, but I think he had to see the overall picture of

01:46:36.880 --> 01:46:41.840
what was going on. And what about Hosuh, the fellow founding member of DanPlan who'd been there

01:46:41.840 --> 01:46:47.600
through the highs and lows? What did he say? Well, he hasn't made any official statements,

01:46:47.600 --> 01:46:52.480
any videos, released any DMs, but he has been streaming a fair bit with Steven, and even sought

01:46:52.480 --> 01:46:53.920
to make this comment.

01:46:53.920 --> 01:47:01.360
Back in high school, Daniel was like, a really good guy. I respected him, he was great. He knew

01:47:03.520 --> 01:47:09.200
how to get along with people, but now he has somewhat changed.

01:47:09.840 --> 01:47:11.840
Okay, maybe that's enough.

01:47:11.840 --> 01:47:12.320
That's good.

01:47:12.320 --> 01:47:14.240
So people change, right?

01:47:14.240 --> 01:47:14.800
Yeah.

01:47:14.800 --> 01:47:15.040
Okay.

01:47:15.040 --> 01:47:20.880
People change, and depending on the circumstances and the factors, I could not foresee it. Like,

01:47:20.880 --> 01:47:21.760
people change.

01:47:21.760 --> 01:47:24.800
What that means exactly, I'll let you decide.

01:47:24.800 --> 01:47:29.120
Another one of my friends, DarthPina, also made a video on the topic that will be linked in the

01:47:29.120 --> 01:47:33.440
pinned comment below, which integrates interviews with some fresh perspective. I definitely

01:47:33.440 --> 01:47:38.320
recommend checking his take out if you have the chance. In the end, both sides have said their

01:47:38.320 --> 01:47:43.120
part, and we shouldn't expect more, but we can always do our best to understand.

01:47:43.120 --> 01:47:47.920
It does seem like a divorce, with the channel being torn between two rather determined figures,

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:52.560
and although some people may take a strong side, a lot of people just seem confused and

01:47:52.560 --> 01:47:57.760
forlorn, with many coming back to these videos to pay their respects like a YouTube gravestone.

01:47:57.760 --> 01:48:02.800
It's sad that some people are just waiting for DanPlan to turn around and say it was a huge prank,

01:48:02.800 --> 01:48:07.200
because that's the degree that their perception was shattered. It's phenomenal.

01:48:07.200 --> 01:48:11.360
I'd say this topic reminded me of my Spill video, in a way, when I spoke about the corporatisation

01:48:11.360 --> 01:48:16.240
of YouTube. In that upload, I noted that once you give the voice of a channel a personality,

01:48:16.240 --> 01:48:21.520
people become connected to that as a brand, and that voice has much more power in the future of

01:48:21.520 --> 01:48:26.080
the channel as the owner. Today's situation, although not identical, was a test of that,

01:48:26.080 --> 01:48:30.960
and regardless of who you side with, audience sentiment was clear. Steven established his

01:48:30.960 --> 01:48:35.440
character, and once people began to associate the characteristics with the name, the association

01:48:35.440 --> 01:48:39.920
reversed, and people came back not just for the jokes or the banter, but for Steven, as much as

01:48:39.920 --> 01:48:44.960
they came back for Hosuh or Daniel, and that sentiment echoed throughout the drama. He wasn't

01:48:44.960 --> 01:48:49.680
just a member, he was the member, and the scale of this drama is a testament to that.

01:48:50.320 --> 01:48:54.800
DanPlan was a channel which was the passion project of its titular creators, a channel that

01:48:54.800 --> 01:48:59.440
brought joy unto many people, and found great success thanks to its dynamic concepts and

01:48:59.440 --> 01:49:05.680
energetic interplay between its hosts. It's BTW series, in a way, became synonymous with DanPlan.

01:49:05.680 --> 01:49:11.280
If BTW went down, DanPlan was going to face a real challenge in its continuation, and with this new

01:49:11.280 --> 01:49:16.880
era, it seems Dan is attempting to reinvent the brand, but with the legacy of BTW engraved in

01:49:16.880 --> 01:49:20.640
its identity, one thing is for certain, DanPlan will never be the same.

01:49:23.840 --> 01:49:30.400
I'd first of all like to give a thanks to a creator who I really have come to like, by the

01:49:30.400 --> 01:49:35.280
name of Antoine. I caught one of his videos on DanPlan, and I reached out to him, and he was

01:49:35.360 --> 01:49:41.520
really helpful, and provided me with a resource that I wouldn't have been able to use otherwise

01:49:41.520 --> 01:49:47.920
to make this video. So, a massive thank you to Antoine, go check out his channel, he's not making

01:49:47.920 --> 01:49:53.920
too many videos right now, but go and send him some love and appreciation, I think he's got a

01:49:53.920 --> 01:50:01.120
really good head on his shoulders, and very nice technical style. I have nothing too much else to

01:50:01.120 --> 01:50:05.680
say about it, just go and check him out, send him some appreciation, thank you man.

01:50:31.120 --> 01:50:35.920
Work in the grind, much respect to them, keep up the great work. I would also like to thank my

01:50:35.920 --> 01:50:40.080
patreons, my $10 patreons plus will be up on the screen right now. I want to give a big thanks to my

01:50:40.080 --> 01:50:47.760
$50 patreons, we have Amanda, we have Caroline, we have Hypercube, and we have some hullabaloo,

01:50:47.760 --> 01:50:53.120
thank you so much for your support, it means a lot. And we also have to give a big thanks to my $100

01:50:53.120 --> 01:51:00.480
patreons, and that is Brandon Junck, Christopher Koras, and Yesenia Ramirez. Thank you so much for

01:51:00.480 --> 01:51:06.000
your support guys, it means the world to me. If you wanna reach me, Twitter, but I've been quite busy

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:10.720
recently, and obviously you can join my Discord, I must give you a warning, I haven't been using my

01:51:10.720 --> 01:51:16.480
Facebook recently, so there's my warning. I don't really have too much else to add, hang in there

01:51:16.480 --> 01:51:20.000
guys, I'm sending my love. Keep up the hustle my friends.
