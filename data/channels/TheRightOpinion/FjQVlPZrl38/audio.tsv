0	5120	So if any of you see someone spreading creepy, perverted things that they made up in their
5120	10000	mind about my life, about Lainey's life, about Sarah's life, you can send them the link to
10000	14640	this video to expose how incredibly stupid and gross they are.
14640	16000	Kill her, God.
16000	18320	I don't even know if I can do this.
27200	28480	Like, please leave me alone.
28480	29040	Like, I've asked.
29040	33120	I asked you to stop using my name and my information in your videos.
33120	34080	And you told me that you would.
34080	35680	You asked me to stop contacting you.
35680	38080	And again, today you posted a video.
59040	72800	Hello, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome back to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time,
72800	78720	and I hope you are settled in today as you join me to enjoy this second installment on this wonderful series.
78720	83680	If you haven't watched my first video, I would implore you to do so, not just for context's sake, but for
83680	85680	the entertainment value as well.
85680	90080	However, if you did join me, you'll know through the measures of controversy and the intertwining of
90080	95520	narratives, the subject of today's video cultivated and crafted an audience incredibly carefully, one that
95520	100560	was catered to him only, and then used that audience in question to solicit various favours.
100560	102720	It was a game of control to our onion friend.
102720	108160	However, if it had stopped there, we may just call him out for being an exploitative creator to a worse
108160	112480	degree than normal, of which there are a few on the platform.
112560	117760	No, you see, it wasn't just a control thing over his audience, it was something that he wanted to bring into
117760	123120	his personal life, and that which could be found in all of his relationships, often to a degree in which
123120	124720	questions would be asked.
124720	129600	That's where we're going now, and I don't think this part needs too much of an intro, I suggest we make like
129600	131520	DeFranco and jump right in.
132560	137520	If you watched my part on Jay Albury's video, you'll likely know that I have the displeasure of researching
137520	141040	a large majority of Onision's relationships while on YouTube.
141040	145520	Back then, however, it was a matter of tackling the subject from the standpoint of neutrality.
145520	149920	Now we are back on my channel, and we have already discussed a strong level of theory as it is,
149920	153520	I feel we can take the evidence that was shown, and use it more inductively.
154480	159920	Onision is a control freak, he wants to shape his life around the fantasies, many of which involve YouTube,
159920	165680	and involve people. Having control over a fanbase is one thing, having control over a partner is another.
165680	170480	As said, physical proximity works in very significant ways, and by creating relationships he can
170480	176080	manufacture new conflicts to present to his audience, but he had his preference on the younger side.
176080	181360	I don't know if his choice to enter relationships with younger girls was a kink thing, or more a control thing,
181360	186800	but going after people who are lacking direction in a vulnerable position, and open to receiving support
186800	191920	from someone, often led Onision to relationships with those between the ages of 16 and 18,
191920	197760	though there is deviation. Over the years, as he aged, and as he got through a fair few relationships,
197760	203520	the age gap increased, showing that he was still targeting the same people. What exactly did he want?
204160	206720	Let's talk about the relationships of Onision.
207360	212400	Onision's relationships while he was on the platform started with a person he was actually married to prior
212400	217280	to the creation of his YouTube account, a person named Sky. This relationship, despite Greg's habits
217280	222400	of putting all his problems about it on the internet, did seem to be mildly functional at one point.
222400	228080	However, all this began to fall apart when a new individual was introduced to his life. Her name is Shiloh.
229040	241200	Shiloh was a Canadian punk artist who actually had a charting hit at one point, it kinda slaps,
241200	247040	even if it's a tad dated. However, in 2010, she was pulled into the Onision rabbit hole. Shiloh allegedly
247040	252640	started looking into Greg's channel after seeing his I'm a Banana video on TV, truly a love story
252640	257360	for the ages. They began communicating, they developed a friendship, that friendship eventually
257360	262960	turned into an emotional affair, and by the end of 2010, Greg drafts up the divorce papers for Sky.
262960	267440	The original divorce documents are shown here, they included the assertion that Sky forfeited
267440	272400	her homeownership rights, and that Greg would pay her $1000 a month for 12 months if she moved out.
272480	278480	Greg has regularly cited this and claimed that Sky did not honour this signed contract, but Sky has responded
278480	283440	saying that given she signed the contract under emotional stress and verbal abuse delivered by her friend
283440	289440	Gregory here, the court predetermined it as null. Now, there are a load of messy details regarding his divorce,
289440	294320	and it's trimmed to Sky that is a much more in-depth story that we will partly cover soon, but the truth is
294320	300000	that it seems she was not invested in his YouTube channel in a way that he wanted her to be, and Shiloh was,
300000	304480	so for him it was not a difficult decision, and once he had demonstrated his commitment to Shiloh
304480	309840	less than a few months after the divorce, Onision introduced Shiloh in his Onision's Girlfriend video.
309840	316560	All very jolly and joyous, but this does not last, as this relationship quickly devolves into rather grim
316560	321680	territory. One of the first controversies occurs with the video Shiloh Forgot Me, when Shiloh allegedly suffers
321680	327680	a seizure which invokes memory loss. Onision decides to film it and upload it to YouTube like many normal people would.
327720	338720	Onision's Girlfriend video.
338720	343600	Unsurprisingly, the then normal people in his audience called him out for this, apparently there were people
343600	348320	in his audience with sense. He deleted the video due to backlash, but also uploaded a video called
348320	352800	I Respect Her Wishes, in which he defends the decision to not have her see a medical professional,
352800	355600	because they had already worked it out themselves.
355600	362080	The reason I didn't call an ambulance is because I wouldn't want someone to call an ambulance on me if I lost my memory.
362080	367040	I don't see what doctors are going to do to help Shiloh.
367040	373840	As mentioned, this distrust in medical professionals isn't coincidental, he didn't want anyone actually advising on his personal life,
373840	376920	especially people who are astute enough to see what is going on.
376920	382840	The saga then continued barely a couple months later when he uploaded videos called Shiloh Threaten Me and The Truth,
382880	388880	which both frame his then ex-girlfriend as unstable. In between this, he has another relationship with a person called Adrian,
388880	395880	and this is when Onision uploaded the videos, which led many people to question whether he was suffering from borderline personality disorder or not.
395880	410040	Onision's relationship didn't work out, I'm gonna be single for some time, and I have no idea if I'm even willing to put another girl through the rollercoaster that is Onision,
410040	418520	because I am a douchebag. Truth is, I don't think he did, I think Adrian was a person that Onision had more trouble controlling than most,
418520	423800	and therefore took to social media to attempt to manipulate her back with public show's remorse and regret.
423800	427000	He was looking for a new person to play his game, and Adrian didn't.
427000	439800	And I don't even want to point a single finger of blame at Adrian. She's a nice lady. She really is. She deserves someone much more like herself, not like me.
439800	452920	Because, I don't know, we're just so not compatible, it's ridiculous. And it was my mistake for... Well, it was my mistake for being a dick.
453000	460360	As this crumbled pretty quickly, he left a string of failed endeavours to win her back, including numerous voicemails that would eventually become very notorious
460360	464920	and symbolic of Greg's attempt to reconcile relationships that he was losing grip of.
464920	471480	And, just so you know, everything I said publicly, there were never attacks on you. I was just living my life.
471480	477400	Like, it's kinda like how you were just living your life when you had the same essential massage. You were just being you.
479400	485480	I know I was busy blaming you for a lot of stuff, but that's not my fault.
486040	492840	Fortunately for Onision, it wasn't too long before Shiloh got back together with him, and this gave him a platform to publicly call out Adrian,
492840	495560	even implying she had STDs.
495560	508840	The home that I ended up in was smaller than the first home. It's much prettier. Much more clean.
508840	516520	He likely did this out of business because he couldn't control her, but also now he had Shiloh back, he felt secure in having another person he could take advantage of,
516520	519080	and believe me, he really did go to town this time.
519080	524360	Firstly, there was the issue that Shiloh was expecting. Originally, Onision did this weird celebratory video,
524360	529320	and then there was this miscarriage, and then Onision uploads a video announcing Shiloh has sepsis,
529320	533720	then he removes it and re-uploads it to his archive channel, blaming Shiloh for lying to him,
533720	538520	and then Shiloh goes back to Canada for treatment regarding her case, and once again she is beyond reach.
538520	544040	So what does Greg do? Well, he goes back to being sulky, sad, and forlorn. He uploads a goodbye Shiloh video,
544040	550280	and makes multiple sad hour posts into the public sphere. Also in this time, Shiloh's mother mercifully hides her passport,
550280	555880	and although Onision sends Shiloh money to purchase a new one, she does not. Maybe she worked out what was good for her.
555880	562600	Onision also starts multiple feuds with his other exes in this time, I assume to try and show some sort of proxy loyalty.
562600	568280	He's off attacking his exes, and yet only has commitment to Shiloh and everything she represents.
568360	574360	Sounds a bit sketchy, does it not? Well, let's sketch a little more to create an even clearer picture.
579560	585960	Onision misses Shiloh so much, and he's once again showing how loyal he is, but she is gradually slipping away.
585960	590280	Greg seems to have this algorithm of measuring how worthwhile the pursuit of a relationship is.
590280	594440	In Shiloh's absence, he clearly felt, to an extent, there was something redeemable,
594440	599160	they had a breakup the year before where Shiloh went back to him as mentioned, and so in my opinion,
599160	604760	Onision viewed a repeat of that completely viable, thus explaining all this sad regret posting.
604760	610440	As said, Shiloh's mother hid her passport, and some distance had clearly given Shiloh time to make her mind up,
610440	614520	and eventually, at the start of February, Shiloh and Onision ended their relationship.
614520	619960	Immediately, however, Onision's tune changed, very shortly after he released a video called It's Over,
619960	624200	suddenly calling Shiloh out for all her lies, in musical form of course.
624760	649960	Now once again, it's plausible to say that Onision may have had a revelation himself,
649960	655240	but really what followed felt rather contrived, added on top of the fact that when Shiloh admitted to
655240	659480	quote, emotionally cheating on Greg when confronted with various pieces of evidence,
659480	665320	Greg once again used this to emphasise how evil Shiloh was, branding her as cheating scum,
665320	670520	and although of course that sort of behaviour isn't endorsed, it's hard to ignore the fact that as far as he knew
670520	677400	at that point, Shiloh did to him exactly what he did to Sky with Shiloh, which was basically overlapping
677400	682840	the end of a previous relationship with the start of a new one. So his fury seems somewhat hypocritical
682840	687800	and contrived to say the least, even more so considering the drama that would occur a few years later,
687800	693160	but we'll get to that in a bit. None of Greg's reactions ever seem particularly natural, everything seems
693160	698600	designed to elicit some outcome he desires, which often requires swinging between contradictory
698600	703800	standpoints. It seems he will do his best to maintain control over a person until they are out of reach,
703880	707560	and then flip the switch. Let's talk about that a little more then.
707560	712680	Alright, so we've had a decent analysis of a large amount of real-time evidence thus far,
712680	716840	this is what was observed at the time, but there's still a lot more to discuss.
716840	722600	Onision was not a man with great ambitions, he just wanted to control you under every circumstance,
722600	727480	and when you weren't under his control, he'd play a variety of mental games, I think you can categorise
727480	733080	them into the five stages of Onision relationships. The first one was bait, he'd reach out to people in a
733080	737720	caring way, perhaps even in a vulnerable way that would suggest that he needs someone, he needs a
737720	742360	person to a reasonable extent. This tricks the unfortunate person into believing that they would
742360	747000	have some conducive role to play in Onision's life. Onision is also a person with a decent amount of
747000	752760	resources, so if you can help him, maybe you can be a part of his kingdom, how inspiring. And then
752760	757160	he shows you how committed he is, he invests in you, he makes you feel like he cares about you
757160	761560	specifically, he spends time and money to come and see you, and before you know it, you're in his
761560	767320	arms, and you can live out his dreams together. Of course, I emphasise, his dreams, not yours.
767320	772120	Over the first few years on this time on YouTube, it's clear he wanted someone he could use in a way
772120	777480	that he wanted to, someone who he could manufacture conflicts around, and with Shiloh, he really found
777480	782520	that, he found someone who would play his games, someone who would play into the drama, threats, and
782520	801560	testimonies. Then comes the third phase, if you're lucky you have some distance from Onision,
801560	806440	he suddenly feels remorseful, he misses you so much, he's afraid he might never find another
806440	811320	girl like you again, you weren't like all those other women, they didn't compare to you, you were
811320	816680	special, he's gonna post all these sad statuses onto the internet, he might even upload a video or two.
842200	847000	Sometimes this might pull you back to stage 2, but also, the distance might allow you to see the
847000	851240	situation more clearly, and finally make a decision that you don't want to ever interact with him
851240	853640	again, and that's when we reach stage 4.
853640	875240	Suddenly, in fact, you were just like all those who came before you, you were a cheat, you were
875240	881000	a slut, you were a liar, you were taking his money, you probably had STDs for all he's concerned about,
881000	886040	and now Onision is mad, because he thought you were different, and now he's gonna stress to his
886040	892040	audience that you weren't, and you hurt him just like the rest, and now he's so broken, oh and now
892040	897400	he wishes that someone would come and rescue him, oh if only there was someone out there who would
897400	902760	save him. Meanwhile you're sat there, shell shocked from the relationship, and you just wish he would
902760	909560	stop talking about you. He did this with everyone the audience could identify, primarily with Sky,
909560	914360	Adrian, and Shiloh in the first few years, he simultaneously would keep in contact with them,
914360	919320	while demonising and shading them at every possible opportunity. Eventually many of these girls would
919320	924680	reach the fifth stage, but I will talk about that in due time, I think I have more than enough.
924680	935560	Onision had an assemblage of individuals who either partially or went through this arc, and that was
935640	940680	because he wanted them to play his game, and many of them, although vulnerable, did have some sense
940680	945720	to escape this. However this changed when we introduced the character called Kai. Kai, who was
945720	950760	Lainey upon meeting Greg, is Onision's current husband, and another highly controversial person
950760	954920	whose details we'll delve into in a bit. Onision- I proposed to her in probably the least classy way
954920	959080	possible, I proposed to her via video over the internet, in such a weird way, I basically said it
959080	964520	like this, you know I'm gonna marry you right? That's how I did it. Like many of the people who
964520	969720	Onision involved himself with, Kai found his future husband through the fan infatuation,
969720	975320	and like a jigsaw falling into place when Onision put out one of his post Shiloh tweets asking where
975320	981400	his soulmate was, Kai replied here, and Onision, smelling the potential from a mile away like a
981400	987480	blissfully basted Christmas turkey, moved into the DMs, asking why he exactly felt this way,
987480	992280	so the communication elaborates, and a new relationship begins to flourish. Of course,
992280	996520	this relationship is kept private, likely because Kai was underage at the time.
996520	1001320	As the cycle begins, Onision wants to show his commitment to Kai, but this time the relationship
1001320	1005480	takes a slightly different approach. Whether Onision had identified that Kai was pretty
1005480	1010840	infatuated as it was, he proposed to him less than a month after they started dating. This
1010840	1015720	sort of thing may have felt romantic to someone like Kai, but as Onision probably recognised,
1015720	1020280	it placed a lot of pressure on him to be committed to the relationship, and saying yes would tighten
1020280	1025560	their bond in a very special way, and Kai said yes, and Greg moves out to New Mexico to live
1025560	1030120	with Kai. A fair few people notice this, and although he avoids the topic, some people begin
1030120	1034360	to put the dots together. After a bit of back and forth where it fluctuates between being long
1034360	1039320	distance and close proximity, Onision rents out a place to secretly live with Kai while his parents
1039320	1044040	are under the impression that Kai is staying at college. Kai turns 18, and less than a month later
1044040	1048440	they are married and living together in Washington. Now of course, this relationship wasn't without
1048440	1052840	its drama, but it was mainly related to loyalty, which says more than enough. In this time,
1052840	1057000	Onision also impregnates Kai, and they have a child, and they also have another child later
1057000	1061720	by the way. Now reflecting back on Kai though, it wouldn't surprise me if Onision saw having children
1061720	1066840	as a way to cement that loyalty, and increase the cost of leaving him to Kai. On top of this,
1066840	1071720	Onision had feuds with Kai's family over their very legitimate concerns. I didn't think this was
1071720	1075960	particularly relevant at first, but these feuds would distance Kai from his family, thus making
1075960	1081240	him and Greg more isolated in their relationship, thus once again affirming this theory of control.
1081240	1084760	Onision- Mr. Grump wanted to meet me at Olive Garden. We'll say that's in Olive. Does that even
1084760	1089080	show up on this? Stupid green. So Mr. Grump is sitting across the table from me at Olive Garden.
1089080	1092280	Our conversation was kind of chill at first, but then his eyes started turning red, and he started
1092280	1095880	getting teary, because Mr. Grump decided to threaten my well-being. Despite my relationship
1095880	1099640	with Laney being legal, he also threatened to put me in prison. Despite, again, our relationship
1099640	1103480	being totally legal. So he threatened to seriously harm me and possibly kill me, as well as threaten
1103480	1108200	me in other ways. F that guy. That was a reference to Greg's father-in-law, by the way. Delightful.
1108200	1114200	By 2015, everything seemed to be going fairly solid. They were one real happy family. However,
1114200	1118840	happiness seldom lasts forever, and the beginning of what has led up to the events that we observe
1118840	1123960	today was about to occur. I suggest we talk about the next stage of this relationship.
1124600	1129080	He's sitting across the table from him, and he's probably going to threaten to sue me for this
1129080	1132040	video. He's already threatened to sue me before, but that's fine. I'm allowed to tell stories
1132040	1138600	about people without using faces or names, etc. But he was being hard on me for my age
1138600	1144760	gap with Laney, and I had a nine-year age gap with Laney. And he told me to come back in 10 years,
1144760	1149960	like, not till Laney was 25, to date Laney. And I was just, like, thinking, how much power does
1149960	1157160	this guy think he has? Like, this is kind of nuts. Back in 10 years, like, not till Laney was 25.
1157160	1161000	Back in 10 years, like, not till Laney was 25.
1161000	1166840	Back in 10 years, like, not till Laney was 25.
1166840	1173800	Wait, what? I'm gonna hope that was an error on his part, and, uh, continue regardless.
1179320	1184120	Onision gives me the impression that he has this stage of plans in his head, and once one is
1184120	1188760	satisfied, he can move on to the next. So now we have this marriage with a person who was clearly
1188760	1193240	rather attached to him, he then moved on to exploring another character for their Fifty Shades
1193240	1199240	of Fukuri. Most of this probably occurred initially in 2015, though it was definitely conceived prior.
1199240	1204520	It seems that this plan involved finding other younger individuals, and involving them in their
1204520	1209480	little project. Now, I'm going to save the spiciest details until the end, but there is a lot on our plate,
1209480	1211160	so it's best we get started now.
1211160	1212520	Hehe, boi.
1212520	1217160	In this time, Greg and Kai had reached out to various girls, however, none would really enter the public
1217160	1222840	light until a person by the name of Billy. During 2015, Kai comes out as bisexual and genderqueer,
1222840	1228840	and by the end of 2015, Billy begins talking to Kai privately, and very soon, Gregory becomes involved,
1228840	1234120	encouraging Billy to date Kai. Now I know what you're thinking, wait, isn't Greg married to Kai?
1234120	1236440	Well, yes. You know that clip earlier?
1236440	1237560	I'm coming for you.
1238520	1239400	Come to me.
1240440	1241160	Almost there.
1243800	1244520	Wait, what?
1245320	1246280	That's right, baby.
1248120	1249480	Your lips taste like cherry.
1250280	1252040	Oh my god, no.
1252040	1256440	This feels so right without whiskers. No more sandpaper except down there.
1256440	1258520	Mm-hmm, that's where we're approaching.
1258520	1262920	Onision clearly had a phase where his kicks were derived from publicly watching himself be
1263720	1268200	Now of course, if someone wants to upload that content onto YouTube, then they're allowed to,
1268200	1273160	as embarrassing and pathetic as it may seem to me. However, there was more degeneracy to come,
1273160	1278040	as Kai apparently didn't consent for Greg and Billy to date, and when Greg got a bit too
1278040	1282600	intimate with Billy in an instant known as Cuddlegate, the relationship temporarily broke
1282600	1287800	down which led to the legendary I Betrayed My Wife video, once again highlighting Onision's
1287800	1290840	nature of publicly self-shaming when it's beneficial for him.
1290840	1294040	Now I told Lani what happened and it ripped everything apart. I was stupid and I thought
1294040	1297000	that cuddling and a full body massage was harmless. Lani's position is, it wasn't the
1297000	1299720	cuddling and it definitely wasn't the full body massage. It was really all about the fact that
1299720	1303240	she clearly indicated she did not want me cuddling with this person, yet I manipulated my way into
1303240	1306680	cuddling with her anyway, so she saw a huge betrayal in that. After distancing Billy for
1306680	1311240	a bit and trolling her with a fake video before exposing her text, expressing feelings, and
1311240	1316520	framing her as a homewrecker, Onision and Kai once again tighten their bond. However, after this
1316520	1321560	extremely stressful and tense ordeal, they did what any rational couple would do and gradually
1321560	1327640	began integrating Billy back into their life. This occurred over 2016, and eventually this contrived
1327640	1332040	love triangle was reignited, but this love triangle was also very quickly extinguished
1332040	1337000	again by the end of November with the Onision video titled We Broke Up. However, it wasn't
1337000	1341400	actually over and they got back together in December, and then they broke up again in January
1341400	1345800	with another set of videos, one from Billy's side illuminating Onision's tendency to have
1345800	1350840	weird sexual motivations amongst many other things. Alongside this were some beautiful DMs
1350840	1352920	and a video explaining her perspective.
1352920	1361240	So, Onision, please stop harassing me and my best friend. I am tired of seeing your tweets,
1361240	1365800	tired of being tagged in your tweets of you just harassing us, telling us we're awful,
1365800	1369160	druggy people. Please leave me alone.
1369160	1373880	Because of this, she got the full Onision Stage 4 treatment with a 40 minute video that has
1373880	1378360	tragically been eviscerated from the internet. But it seems that Onision wasn't happy with just
1378360	1383320	framing her as a homewrecker, no, he went in alleging that she was a full-blown criminal,
1383320	1388600	which is slightly ironic, but I digress. What was this crime? Well, it was indulging in the
1388600	1392120	Devil's Lettuce, which was against the contract he had written up.
1392120	1396600	Now you may understand why I personally dumped Billy for committing a crime in the state of
1396600	1400520	Virginia. Here's the contract I proposed. He also had some additional comments to make.
1400520	1405560	You're a bad person, a liar, an illegal drug user. You were raised by criminals. You lied
1405560	1411000	to us repeatedly. You, a person who scores lower on IQ tests, who didn't even graduate high school.
1411000	1415080	You cheated on my wife. You act like you're the victim. You got dumped so many times.
1415080	1419640	You're awful, druggy people. You do illegal drugs in the state of Virginia. You are a cheater,
1419640	1425000	Billy. And you lie, an awful druggy. So I told her to get a tramp stamp of I'm a liar
1425000	1428760	because she's a liar. Now, once again, might be a controversial opinion,
1428760	1434040	but I personally find writing a contract up for a relationship slightly stranger than smoking
1434040	1438760	weed, and using that in the title as if it makes for a terrible person. Technically speaking,
1438760	1443480	if she was in breach of a contractual agreement, then you could be obliged to terminate the
1443480	1447640	relationship, but I don't think relationships should be built on contracts regardless.
1447640	1453640	And anyway, it was clear this was a move motivated by the desire for control, something that Billy
1453640	1458040	had expressed herself. I do also hypothesize that this may have been a case of liability.
1458040	1461800	As we know, Onision keeps tabs through the law very closely, and given that he was a more
1461800	1465880	experienced adult, it's possible that he was aware that if there was an incident with the law, and he
1465880	1470440	was linked back to the case, he would be held more severely accountable. A contract may help him avoid
1470440	1475640	that, as sad and tragic as it is. I personally think Onision has a habit of turning legal concerns
1475640	1479880	into moral concerns, often as a way to boost his own credentials. Fortunately for many people,
1479880	1484200	they realized that marijuana indulgence wasn't really the worst thing, and didn't really justify
1484200	1489080	the stream of vitriolic abuse that Greg heard of Billy. Billy was another person who just couldn't
1489080	1493080	tolerate it any further. Billy's decision was also backed by another person called Ayala,
1493080	1497480	so she reposed his ex-girlfriend, who Greg had some previous conflicts with. Her video demanding
1497480	1500640	that Onision cease and desist is actually still up.
1500640	1506520	Like, please leave me alone like I've asked. I asked you to stop using my name and my information in your videos,
1506520	1511400	and you told me that you would. You asked me to stop contacting you, and again, today you posted a video
1511480	1517960	with a screenshot of our email conversation with my name in it, and like, obviously,
1519000	1522760	you think that you're right and justified in all the things that you're doing, and no,
1522760	1526120	I don't feel bad for the fact that I smoked weed, but it is scary.
1526120	1530920	This drama was definitely one of the first situations where the cracks began to really appear,
1530920	1535320	and commentary channels began to take notice too, and although many of them didn't provide the most
1535320	1540520	inspiring commentary, attention and publicity are always important. With Kai by his side, Onision
1540520	1544920	didn't need to worry about being alone, so this made him more confrontational, and more dismissive
1544920	1549640	of those he felt did him wrong, and anyway, he had another great friend too, a person by the name of
1549640	1555160	Sarah, and boy oh boy, they were really doing a favour for her. So emerging from the very stressful
1555160	1560040	drama that Onision was clearly bothered by, he thought the best thing to do was to make a video
1560040	1564680	responding to other people that were bothering him regarding another situation relating to a person
1564680	1571800	by the name of Sarah. Now Sarah hadn't been involved in too much drama herself, she wasn't
1571800	1577080	a person particularly indulgent in conflict, and there was no public falling out, so what was the
1577080	1582200	problem? So I posted a picture to Instagram of myself just hanging out in a car with Sarah today,
1582200	1588200	and I got a lot of familiar comments. Why are you living with a 16 year old? Ah, Sarah was 16,
1588200	1593160	and at the time, she was living with Onision and Kai. Was that really the best idea? Well,
1593160	1598040	according to the individuals of interest, it was. Sarah was from what appeared to be a rather
1598040	1602520	troubled household, she had been following Kai since a couple years prior, and had began speaking
1602520	1608360	to him when she was 14. However, by the end of 2016, her home life appeared to have deteriorated,
1608360	1614040	and apparently, in an extremely low and vulnerable moment, Kai and Onision offered their home as a
1614040	1619160	safe haven for a girl who felt like she had no other option. Now many may ask why they didn't
1619160	1624200	look at other, less radical options, or perhaps understand the situation more carefully than just
1624200	1630280	rushing in and basically temporarily adopting this person, and to that, I'd say, good question.
1630280	1635160	As we know, Onision doesn't like to involve himself with the authorities. If you're wondering
1635160	1640840	why people didn't call Onision out for that at the time, well, it's because he wouldn't really say.
1640840	1645160	Onision- You may ask why she's living with us. Well, this is where I kind of hit a roadblock,
1645160	1649720	because we're talking about Sarah's private life, which she doesn't want to share with all of you,
1649720	1653720	and she has a right to not have that shared with you. In fact, I told her I was going to make this
1653720	1658520	video, and she very clearly communicated that she doesn't want people to know about her private
1658520	1663880	life. So because she clearly showed disinterest in me sharing her private life, slash information
1663880	1668520	about why she's here with all of you, I feel it's not appropriate for me to speak further of it.
1668520	1672600	This was the best option for him. Although he states it was in Sarah's best interests,
1672600	1677160	it was also in his best interests, giving the audience as little information regarding these
1677160	1681560	stories gives people less scope to pick them apart, and if people tried to pry too much,
1681560	1686840	he'd be able to accuse them of being intrusive, and not respecting Sarah's privacy. How dare you
1686840	1692920	do that? But hey, you know, it was a misguided favour maybe, but nothing remotely implicative,
1692920	1698680	and anyone claiming so were creeps. You people were the real perverts. This man who has done
1698680	1705160	nothing more than direct his own fetish films has kindly taken in a 16 year old from a troubled
1705160	1709880	household. You should be grateful that he's out here doing God's work.
1709880	1714520	But because you guys are so perverted, and because your minds are so screwed up,
1714520	1719480	you just make up all these creepy scenarios, and you go spreading them around the internet
1719480	1723480	as if they're the truth. So to those people, understand that I've consistently discussed
1723640	1727960	about the fantasies that you create inside your head about my life.
1727960	1733800	Yeah, you stick it to them Gregory, you put them in their place. All this around the same time as
1733800	1738840	this drama that Billy and Ayala are stirring quite frantically, it all becomes quite hard to follow
1738840	1745240	for many viewers, but the facts remain that something was up. In February 2017, Kai and Sarah
1745240	1750360	conducted a live stream to decry the allegations, and generally Onision and Party were mainly
1750360	1752840	focused on preventing this perception from spreading.
1771080	1775400	So not too long after, Sarah went back to her home, but then she came back less than a couple
1775400	1779800	months later in April, and then she went home again, and a few months later she came back again
1779800	1782760	in August, and then she went home again in November.
1782760	1788360	So if any of you see someone spreading creepy perverted things that they made up in their mind
1788360	1793720	about my life, about Lainey's life, about Sarah's life, you can send them the link to this video to
1793720	1797240	expose how incredibly stupid and gross they are.
1797240	1801960	In the video defending his perspective, Onision creates this strawman that people have a problem
1801960	1806280	with the fact that they're living with a 16 year old, which I'm not sure is the core issue.
1806280	1811160	Quite simply put, when someone is a rich, famous, influential YouTuber, even if they are unpopular
1811160	1815640	or controversial, they still hold a level of power. I don't think that people, especially
1815640	1820200	the YouTube community, with its incredible diversity within reason, have a problem with
1820200	1824120	people casually hanging out with others of different ages if they have a similar level of
1824120	1828680	mobility. When I worked in retail in my teens, I would hang out with older individuals, and there
1828680	1834600	was no tension. The situation here is that people know the implications. When Sarah first left after
1834600	1840280	the set of controversies involving Billy, Onision made this video, basically blaming everyone else
1840280	1843080	while making some very interesting comments himself.
1843080	1847480	You could say we are kicking Sarah out, but I don't consider that the case. It's more like just
1847480	1852360	sending her home, and it's not exactly anyone's fault, unless like the internet were a person,
1852360	1856040	and then it might be the internet's fault, because really, if the internet wasn't weirdly involved
1856040	1860120	with everything going on, then things would most likely be fine. Apparently Sarah also stated to
1860120	1863800	me that she remembered saying something about her one day being in a relationship with Lainey, and
1863800	1867960	that was super confusing to me as I had made it clear to the public, as you've seen in previous
1867960	1871560	videos, and I also made it clear repeatedly to Sarah that was never going to happen. So seeing
1871560	1877000	Sarah say these things really freaked me out. I mean, she's 16, I'm 31, this is creepy. And I know
1877000	1879960	a lot of people are going to ignore what I'm saying right now, so I'm going to say it again.
1879960	1885000	There was never a romantic relationship between Lainey and Sarah. Even her mom has told off the
1885000	1890680	internet regarding this issue. There's nothing weird. Lainey and Sarah are and have always been
1890680	1895800	just friends. I want you to keep these in mind. Over the next couple years, Sarah would visit,
1895800	1900760	and then leave and visit again. It was pretty suspicious, but at this time Onision was also
1900760	1905400	attracting plenty of drama elsewhere, particularly due to his outlandish statements on people like
1905400	1910360	Shane Dawson and Eugenia Cooney. It did honestly cross my mind if he was doing this as a method
1910360	1915240	of distraction. I do believe that Onision can be very calculated when needs require him to be,
1915240	1920120	such as him hiding Kai from the public eye until he was nearly 18, because he knew he would be
1920120	1924920	scrutinized from both his audience and Kai's parents. I wouldn't put it past him being rather
1924920	1929480	shaken by the Billy situation, and wanting to distract from these statements, and thus making
1929480	1934440	videos on people he knew would stir up outrage and reaction, while steering them away from what
1934440	1939080	actually mattered. Now as always, when drama takes off, it has either the momentum to snowball,
1939080	1944680	or die down, and with the Sarah drama, for a bit, it died down, mainly because Sarah herself was
1944680	1949240	quite a reclusive person, and was clearly in a sensitive situation, but the uncertainty lingering
1949240	1953640	over Sarah's status probably meant an air of caution in people's approach. Nonetheless,
1953640	1958520	with what we know now, we can say with confidence that Mr Onion here wasn't acting completely in
1958520	1963240	good faith. On one hand, Sarah may have felt fortunate to have someone like Greg in her life,
1963240	1967800	who can offer her this home away from her own, which I have no reason to not believe wasn't
1967800	1972920	trouble to an extent. Why would she want to stir that up? She's still very young and vulnerable,
1972920	1978520	but that was the point. However, at the start of 2019, she had also defended Greg and Kai herself
1978520	1983480	fairly consistently over this time. For example, this clip from the start of 2019, in which she
1983480	1989720	argues in their favour. People are saying that we had sexual conversations, or were planning on
1989720	1998360	having sexual relations when I was underage, and we never did. I don't know why people are now
1998920	2004040	saying this, and bringing up old screenshots that have already been addressed, but Kai is one of the
2004040	2009640	sweetest people I know, and he doesn't deserve this, and it's not fair to me, and it's not fair
2009640	2015480	to him, and I wish this would all stop. Assumedly, this is what left many people rather quiet at the
2015480	2020440	time. However, something that both Greg and Sarah knew was that eventually Sarah would reach a stage
2020440	2025320	of mobility and sanity where she wouldn't necessarily be confined by the same chains,
2025320	2029960	and at a point she would have the option to break free. It was just a case of whether she'd let
2029960	2049720	herself. Let's talk about it more. You remember the clip I told you to keep in mind?
2049720	2053320	Apparently Sarah also stated to me that she remembered saying something about her one day
2053320	2057400	being in a relationship with Laney, and that was super confusing to me as I had made it clear
2057400	2061320	to the public as you've seen in previous videos, and I also made it clear repeatedly to Sarah that
2061320	2065240	was never going to happen. So seeing Sarah say these things really freaked me out. I mean,
2065240	2071400	she's 16, I'm 31, this is creepy. Yes, that delightful one. It's a bad enough clip as it is,
2071400	2076200	but why on earth would you bring attention back then to these details when no one else was aware
2076200	2080680	of them? Well, in my opinion, it was because he knew he'd eventually be called back on these
2080680	2085000	details, and having already addressed them as confidently as he did, he could say, see,
2085080	2090440	I already spoke about this and no one challenged me on it. Not even Sarah. Onision always wanted
2090440	2095400	to be one step ahead of the drama. He wanted to set the record straight, be the voice of reason
2095400	2099800	and truth. So over the last 48 hours, some interesting things have gone down and I need
2099800	2103960	to talk about them because if I don't talk about them, then naturally with the online community,
2103960	2108280	rumors will run rampant and no one will have a video correcting those rumors with facts. So here
2108280	2113000	is that video. But the truth was going to reveal itself very soon because Onision, in spite of
2113000	2117560	suppressing these allegations, was holding back a river of sorts. And now we're going to talk
2117560	2123080	about why that dam was eventually busted. Earlier in the video, I spoke about the first four stages
2123080	2128440	of relationships with Onision. This is stage five, and I will now explain how it transpires in the
2128440	2134280	way it does. The first phenomenon is what I like to call the Bishop Brennan effect. Although there
2134280	2138840	is probably a more formal title, I quite like it because I think it's easier to explain. Bishop
2138840	2143480	Brennan was a character in the British comedy Father Ted, and in the third series, there is an
2143480	2148680	episode where Ted has to kick Bishop Brennan up the arse as a forfeit for cheating on a football
2148680	2153960	match. You really have to kick him up the arse, Ted. I lost the bet, Dougal. I have to do my
2153960	2158600	forfeit. Now Father Ted has no clue of how he's going to get away with it. Eventually, after some
2158600	2163400	scuffed attempts, he comes up with the bold idea that if he just acts as if he hasn't done anything
2163400	2167960	at all, then Bishop Brennan will be so shocked that he'll have no reason to question it. He
2167960	2173640	carries out this plan, and it works. So, off to see the Pope in Rome. I bet you're really looking
2173640	2178760	forward to that. Well, did you see anything? No, nothing there at all, sadly. You were right.
2178760	2185080	It was a wild goose chase. Where's Father Jessup? Maybe he went on ahead. Okay, so see you soon,
2185080	2194040	Your Grace. Come back as soon as you can. Bishop Brennan leaves in complete shock, but because the
2194040	2198600	shock and trauma of being kicked up the arse does not think to challenge Ted. This is the first
2198600	2202920	stage of the Bishop Brennan Effect, and something that can be observed in patterns with the people
2202920	2207720	today. A lot of people either out of shock, avoidance, trauma, and many other valid reasons
2207720	2212760	have avoided making a concerted effort to take Onision down. This does not mean there hasn't been
2212760	2218040	drama, but it means that the scattershot nature of it has led to Onision being pretty unaffected
2218040	2222680	at the core. Now, the second stage of the Bishop Brennan Effect is when Bishop Brennan has had the
2222680	2227400	time to think it over, and it hits him. He didn't kick me up the arse!
2231720	2236120	He goes back to confront Ted, who once again reasserts a different version of events.
2236680	2241320	Are you sure you're not making a terrible, terrible mistake? Do you think that could
2241320	2245720	be possible? Of course it's not! I mean, you know, it did occur to me that it was a bit, um,
2245720	2251080	a bit unbelievable, you know? It's unbelievable because it didn't actually happen.
2251640	2256680	This also confuses Bishop Brennan, to the point where he backs off again, and in fact he only
2256680	2261080	finds out when the evidence stares him right in the face. It's obviously exaggerated to a
2261080	2265560	comedic extent, and probably wouldn't pass in practicality, but I've always found it a good
2265560	2270760	example of how gaslighting can alter a person's own recollection of events. With Onision, his
2270760	2275480	constant documentation was almost a mechanism to try and explain things in the moment so they
2275480	2279960	wouldn't be pulled up against him later, and when people, particularly those he had subjected this
2279960	2285480	misery to, returned to these videos, they probably began to buy into Onision's explanations.
2285480	2290600	Equally, this is why, in many cases, many people turned away from the public eye themselves and
2290600	2295400	chose not to go for Onision because many felt they probably didn't have the influence to stop them.
2295400	2300280	He had control of the narrative. This concern they'd just be another victim of Greg's stream
2300280	2305240	of content was completely understandable because, to be frank, it had worked successfully enough in
2305240	2311320	the past, but Sarah was different. Sarah had her Bishop Brennan moment in mid-2019, and with the
2311320	2315960	help of other individuals, she moved in. As mentioned in the five stages of Onision
2315960	2319960	relationships, once Greg has given up trying to win you back, he'll go in the opposite direction
2319960	2324200	and relentlessly smear you. In some ways, this wasn't any different with Sarah, less than a month
2324200	2329160	after Sarah broke up with him on his Patreon, he uploaded a video called I Need To Talk About BPD,
2329160	2333320	where he frames anyone suffering from the disorder as suffering from memory issues and thus being
2333320	2337720	untrustworthy in their narratives. Now, at the time, Onision was under the impression that Sarah
2337720	2342600	had BPD. This was revealed to not be the case, so his point wouldn't have stood anyway, but the intent
2342600	2347080	remained the same. Although this was a clear attempt to keep his main donors on his side, he didn't
2347080	2351960	actually go public with this, like with many other females hoping to win her back. Maybe it was
2351960	2356040	because he was worried that the public would bring attention to him, maybe he felt like he had already
2356040	2361080	covered himself in the past, maybe he didn't think he had that much to gain from his public viewers,
2361080	2365640	maybe these were all valid reasons, and even though he was probably right in that regard,
2365640	2370600	he had a lot more to lose, because for the first time, he had left an open goal for Sarah to take
2370600	2376360	control of that public narrative, and when you have as many enemies as Onision, any error could
2376360	2381960	be fatal, and his handling of this particular one was just that. Onision knew that his comments would
2381960	2386840	provoke, maybe he was hoping that if he provoked her into stating these allegations in response to
2386840	2392040	his comments that he'd made about BPD, he would be able to publicly frame her as unhinged, and thus
2392040	2397720	proving his point. The idea of, look at this girl, I told you she was mentally unstable, and now she's
2397720	2402760	gone and proven it by accusing me of these heinous things that I would never do and she never said I'd
2402760	2408760	do either. It was Onision at his most manipulative, but it was also Onision at his most stupid,
2408760	2414200	because instead of allowing herself to be isolated in a sort of personal spat, she vowed to never be
2414200	2419720	silenced, and organised a response that would eventually start a domino effect of seismic proportions.
2423000	2429640	Onision had enemies, that much is true, it was like a list, and he just couldn't stop adding to it over
2429640	2434760	the years. Having such an expansive list of enemies will affect many people in different ways, I think
2434760	2439560	for Onision though, it made him complacent. For many, they will be afraid of making enemies,
2439560	2444680	particularly for the grudges that may be held, and how that may be used against people in the future.
2444680	2449800	I think at a point, Onision began to feel that no matter how many enemies he had, they didn't levy
2449800	2454680	any particular power over him, because the audience he held at close quarters were so unbelievably loyal,
2454680	2460040	he could essentially get away with anything, but in August 2019, this was beginning to turn.
2460040	2464840	Let's reintroduce Ayala. We obviously know Ayala from the Billy situation, but she decided to be the
2464840	2470040	person to start the ball rolling on the new set of allegations, this time being the first to publicly
2470040	2475000	call Onision out for his behaviour with Sarah, tweeting that Onision had had sexual intercourse
2475000	2479640	with her. Now obviously, this could be considered inappropriate given it was probably Sarah's story
2479640	2485080	to tell, but Sarah quickly came forward corroborating Ayala's statement. This was then followed by statements
2485080	2489160	which implied they were working together, and that they were going to be delivering swift justice to
2489160	2493800	Onision. This was then followed by a stream in which Sarah talks in a lot of depth regarding her
2493800	2498360	relationship with Gregory, and as this followed through into the next few weeks, the Rolling Stone
2498360	2502760	finally gathered momentum. There were a lot of allegations, each holding their own weight,
2502760	2507320	regarding what both Onision and Kai did to Sarah while she was living with them. These claims
2507320	2512600	reflect what many people had cited as concerns when people originally took issue with Onision's
2512600	2517720	behaviour, but few had sought to push him further due to lack of information. Now, there was more
2517720	2522920	information, and the claims were just as bad as many have believed. In fact, everything that was claimed
2522920	2527480	there fits into the worldview that Onision had presented. For example, this screenshot which claimed
2527480	2531880	that Onision took pleasure in various sexual behaviour, that once again appears to fit in with that
2531880	2537160	cuckold fantasy clip we played earlier. It seems that Onision enjoys screwing around with relationships
2537160	2542040	and fantasies that involve rather deplorable behaviour. I won't be necessarily singling too many
2542040	2546920	examples out because at the end of the day, they all tell the story we expect it to. The quite simply
2546920	2552120	put, Onision was grooming younger individuals for sexual purposes, and he was using his relative
2552120	2557000	power to their powerlessness to tighten his grip and solicit what he wanted from them. I also wanted
2557000	2561800	to focus on this string of tweets that Sarah made on September 3rd. Now, on the one hand, this may
2561800	2566360	seem like someone making a variety of claims, in addition to what they'd already gone public with,
2566360	2570920	but to me this was the breaking of a wall that Onision has regularly used against people.
2570920	2575240	Remember what I said about Onision's smear campaign, with people like Billy for example, he would
2575240	2579480	regularly cite the fact that they conducted some behaviour that Onision deemed as morally
2579480	2584360	inadequate. It would not surprise me if while living with Onision, Sarah had been coerced into
2584360	2589480	doing actions or substances that Greg hoped to use against her in the future, either into shaming her
2589480	2594280	to keep silent, or in an attempt to discredit her when she spoke up. It's often hard to admit to
2594280	2598920	these sorts of behaviours for that exact fear, but the fact that Sarah unapologetically owned these
2598920	2603720	actions and even pushed the responsibility of these actions onto Onision didn't just give Onision
2603720	2607960	a lot less to defend himself with, but it also allowed Sarah to close the discussion on these
2607960	2613480	various elements and focus on the allegations, avoiding the traps that Onision probably laid
2613480	2618120	there for a reason. One of the biggest recurring themes that we have observed is how Onision appears
2618120	2622520	to ruin people's sense of self-worth, particularly illustrated by Billy's video.
2622520	2626840	Onision- I hope you're happy, you completely destroyed all of my pride.
2626840	2630520	What would serve as further evidence to this theory was the detail that Billy was shamed for
2630520	2635000	her association with marijuana when Onision decided to use it against her in his response
2635000	2638840	video. However, one of the things that Sarah alleges is that Onision actually tried to
2638840	2643720	convince her to bake weed brownies. Of course, this is just an allegation, but if true, it very
2643720	2648520	much fits into this idea that they were presenting. I personally believe the intent behind this was
2648520	2653240	exploitation, and using the fact that he exploited them as arguments for their weaknesses. On his old
2653240	2658040	site, one part that has regularly been referenced is how he blames victims who don't come forward.
2658040	2662440	That's not coincidence, he shames people for suffering, and he'll blame you for letting
2662440	2667640	yourself be exploited by him. Onision breaks you, and then convinces you that he's the one
2667640	2672120	to fix you, thus keeping you in this constant cycle. It's one thing to break the cycle,
2672120	2676440	it's another to actively be able to turn it on his head. But what about that video we showed
2676440	2680760	earlier, you know, the one where Sarah denied the allegations? Well, she apparently posted
2680760	2683400	a little blooper which sent a slightly different message.
2683400	2695000	On top of this, she also reveals texts in which Greg persuaded her to make the video,
2695000	2700200	and also suggests in another text that she sign a non-disclosure agreement. I must also add that
2700200	2705160	I really dislike the language he uses in these DMs. When he wants something, he never shows any
2705160	2709640	concern for how the other person feels. He never even seeks to reassure them when they show
2709640	2713880	demonstrable guilt, but he often seeks to reinforce that guilt by focusing on the feelings
2713880	2718280	that have provoked that guilt in the first place, thus mentally weakening them. He's already proven
2718280	2722920	his point in this conversation, and yet he's continuing to dance on this great. This theme of
2722920	2727800	making Sarah feel bad clearly worked for a while, in fact it worked for a significantly long time,
2727800	2732520	but these things seldom work forever, and it's just about what you decide to do when you realise
2732520	2736840	the lie. It's easy when you feel distanced from the situation to not want to return to the source
2736840	2741880	of that pain, and for so long the post-relationship conflict had burnt out, often because Onision
2741880	2746520	managed to make it look like some 50-50 squabble even when many hated him. When this happens,
2746520	2751000	you may lose hope in holding him to account, you may tell yourself that you're the only person
2751000	2755400	hurt by this, and if you just leave it, it'll be a part of history, and you can move on,
2755400	2761320	but Onision wasn't stopping, and Sarah epitomised that continuation, so this time round his accusers
2761320	2765560	came out in force, with the testimonies piled up on top of each other, and it was not something
2765560	2770040	that Onision could fight easily. Let's talk about these allegations, what they tell us,
2770040	2773160	not just about Onision, but the people he targeted.
2780920	2785720	We've already partly talked about a fair few people in this story, particularly on how Onision
2785720	2789960	used them publicly, but there were even more details to be revealed, and details that paint
2789960	2794680	a picture are slightly more worrying. Some of these were based on mere allegations, but many
2794680	2799320	are also backed up with a lot of screenshots which seem verifiable, particularly regarding
2799320	2804360	Onision's communication with many of his accusers. Needless to say, it seems that Gregory has been
2804360	2808840	a busy bee. There's a lot of overlap, but I will be focusing on certain details which I find the
2808840	2814760	most illuminating. First to come forward was Skye, and her sister Netunesa. Skye was, as you should
2814760	2819720	know, Onision's first wife. Both these individuals' relationship with Greg preceded YouTube,
2819720	2824120	alongside some very assertive statements regarding Onision's sexual activity and behavior
2824120	2829240	towards her, the main recurring theme was that of the alimony. Now, Onision has made no secret in
2829240	2834760	the past that he was not a fan of paying alimony, even comparing it to slavery in one video.
2834760	2840920	Onision- Hey, do you support slavery? Like, do you support another person working for something that
2840920	2848120	they cannot profit from whatsoever? Do you support that? Okay, if your answer is no, then you don't
2848120	2853640	support alimony. And this was just one of the many statements he had made both in YouTube and tweet
2853640	2858920	form. Now, as mentioned in the first video, I don't believe Onision is poor, and if he is, it's definitely
2858920	2864040	a result of his own actions, so as part of the divorce settlement, paying Skye's alimony shouldn't
2864040	2869960	have been the most laborious task. However, to Onision, it was a terrible sacrifice, and his language
2869960	2876920	in these emails clearly demonstrate this. He started paying alimony in September of 2011, and by 2012,
2876920	2881400	it had become too much of a task for him. Now, to many who followed it back then, he had already
2881400	2887480	alluded to suicide by alimony in a video around that time. Onision- The only thing it says is basically,
2887480	2895320	I have to be dead in order to stop making these payments. I have to be dead. Talk about incentive
2895320	2900440	of suicide. Well, if I kill myself, at least I don't have to pay my ex-wife anymore.
2901640	2906360	However, building on this, it seems he had sent multiple emails to Skye as well, including one
2906360	2910840	where he emailed her, stating that he planned on killing himself if she didn't halt the alimony
2910840	2916040	payments. This is a rather scummy tactic against something that he signed up to, but clearly thought
2916040	2919880	he could escape through other means. Besides these threats, one of the things that pervades
2919880	2924920	these emails is the tone of enslavement, he just wants to be free. Judging from the language he
2924920	2929640	uses, it's once again about the control, and he hates the fact that someone has power over him
2929640	2934360	in a way that he can't change. He uses multiple different tactics, including regret posting,
2934360	2938360	love bombing, even stating that he's spoken to his lawyer. We've already gone over these
2938360	2943240	tactics, but he switches from one to the other in an attempt to reach Skye's sympathies, fear, guilt,
2943240	2948920	anything that will make her give him what he wants. Fortunately, she was wise enough to identify them,
2948920	2953720	and in spite of a very painful relationship that she had encountered, and Onision's attempts to
2953720	2959880	reframe the situation in future blog posts, Skye had dealt him a hard L, and the emails show that.
2960760	2965320	Quickly following after came the testimony of Netunaza. Greg had known Netunaza from when she
2965320	2969560	was relatively young, in fact, in another tweet she claims he had tried to make out with her when
2969560	2974120	she was 15, which isn't a good look, however unfortunately there are no screenshots to
2974120	2978440	corroborate that. However, there are some additional ones which are quite entertaining.
2978440	2983080	In Netunaza's published screenshots, Onision asks how she's doing, and venting about the Shiloh
2983080	2987640	situation, a few months later he reaches out again as Shiloh returns to Canada for treatment.
2987640	2993080	This continues over 2012, including him offering her money to come on his tour, and even signing
2993080	2997640	her channel over to him, at one point saying that she'll make more money than she ever has before,
2997640	3002680	despite being allegedly broke as he claimed in his alimony emails, he really knows how to pull out
3002680	3008600	the money when it matters. This continued well into 2013, and although on the surface it seems
3008600	3013080	like Greg was trying to pry another victim, she does seem like an exception to the rule in the
3013080	3017400	fact that she's not a fan, and she never showed explicit interest in the first place. It was a
3017400	3023160	pretty lost cause. Why was Greg doing this? Well, once again, maybe a matter of control, maybe even
3023160	3027800	attempt to elicit revenge on Sky. He hates that he's lost control, and thinks maybe he'll be able
3027800	3032920	to bring it back into his life by involving Sky's family, but in all honesty, it might just be one of
3032920	3037320	his fantasies to, you know, something about getting back together with someone's sister.
3037320	3041720	In another email, he does suggest this very strange scenario, which I can only assume
3041720	3045400	came from the pits of his mind, and even in a later video said this.
3045480	3049800	But if I didn't, if I wasn't to wind up with the spouse I have now, I would have actually wanted to
3049800	3054600	pursue the sister to date her, because we had so much more in common, and I would have had to wait
3054600	3059880	a few years because she was 15 and I was 18. At the time, she even tried to kiss me at one point,
3059880	3065320	I dodged it, because one, she was intoxicated, and two, again, our age gap, well, I'm not sure was
3065320	3070760	legal. I think it was legal, actually, but either way, I still dodged the kiss, so I wouldn't even risk
3070760	3072520	something illegal happening.
3072520	3077720	Oh well, there it is, Onision was the one with the self-control, it seems. Of course, he was just
3077720	3083400	waiting, that thing he said he'd never do, but oh well, tomatoes, tomatoes. Also, in this video,
3083400	3088360	he spoke about the time he searched out pictures of Netuneser from when she was modelling, lovely.
3088360	3097800	Because my ex-sister-in-law, uh, eventually became a S-U-I-C-I-D-E girl, okay, so that is a website
3097800	3104120	where girls take photos, or have someone take photos of them, and they get paid money for it.
3104120	3112120	It's artistic, it's typically girls with tattoos, so yeah, so she was exposed a little bit,
3112120	3115320	and everyone got to see the shape of her areolas.
3115320	3121160	Oh, I'm sorry, I mean, everyone got to see them, and he just stumbled across them too.
3121160	3127240	Sky and Netuneser's stories show us what Onision would do when he feels like he's losing control.
3127240	3132200	On the other hand, Shiloh's story tells us what Onision does when he has control.
3132200	3136920	As we spoke earlier, judging by his content, he wanted people to be a part of his little spectacle.
3136920	3140840	We've spoken about a lot of this philosophy, but Shiloh's testimony does create a narrative
3140840	3145800	around the calculated nature of Onision, often checking legal restrictions, and behaving in a
3145800	3150840	way designed to deceive people who may have advised her otherwise, such as isolating Shiloh from her
3150840	3156040	parents, and keeping themselves to themselves. We already spoke about how Onision breaks people,
3156040	3161080	and Shiloh once again pays testimony to that, going into details that you can read here.
3161080	3164120	One re-upload is this very chilling clip.
3164120	3169800	Shiloh- So, he took the scissors to my ear in my sleep, and now I'm bleeding.
3169800	3180120	But, I mean, it's a great look, it's gonna scare all the kids, you know?
3180120	3182120	It hurts a lot, actually.
3182120	3185400	Shiloh- I know this video is never going to be online, right?
3185400	3188280	No one will ever know how much I abuse you.
3188280	3192600	It's ridiculous that you think you'll be successful.
3192600	3198600	How many times do I have to tell you, everything that you want to put online goes through me first?
3198600	3203960	Now, I don't know what the exact explanation is for this, I assume it was uploaded at some point
3203960	3208440	as some intent of a joke, but there's something very personally discomforting about it for me,
3208440	3213000	and a lot of other people. It says more than any testimony really can.
3213640	3217400	One of the more interesting outcomes of this situation was Shiloh's crowdfunding campaign
3217400	3221400	to remove a tattoo with Gregory imprinted on the back of her neck, which although it may have
3221400	3225960	seemed romantic at the time, now in reflection, seems like a painful reminder of a damaging
3225960	3230440	relationship. For someone who once decried the use of tattoos, Greg very quickly changed his mind on
3230440	3234680	them, maybe due to their permanence, or the commitment that they implied. As mentioned earlier,
3234680	3238840	it seems that Greg likes to make people feel attached to him, however, she recently had a new
3238840	3242280	tattoo placed over the old one, and I hope through that she does feel liberated.
3242840	3247320	I don't really wanna just read out the statements, but as always, there will be a reference sheet in
3247320	3252360	the pinned comment. What it does is, it confirms the timeline that we could see in Onision's
3252360	3256840	content, how he often manipulated the environment, and how this had an often effect on someone like
3256840	3261480	Shiloh. However, it not just frames Onision as exploiting our troubles, it paints him as
3261480	3266360	instigating them too. To say it again, Onision breaks you, and then tells you that he's the
3266360	3271400	one to fix you. Shiloh's testimony was anecdotal, but I do believe her, that's a personal opinion,
3271400	3276920	but I think it's a well backed one. However, Fred wasn't the only character in this story, Shiloh,
3276920	3282040	Sky, and Netunasa all tend to predate this next individual, but with Billy and Sarah's stories,
3282040	3285000	we can't go letting them off scot-free, can we?
3285960	3292200	If you think anything ill of Kai, you are retarded. He is one of the most amazing people
3292200	3300200	on planet fucking Earth. If anyone gives anyone shit about anything in this relationship between
3300200	3306440	Kai and I, it should be me. Kai is a fucking angel. And you know, you could ask pretty much,
3307400	3312840	uh, fuck, I don't even want to talk about it.
3324600	3330200	Kai, known as Laney pre-transition, is Onision's current husband, and someone who Onision would
3330200	3334920	probably regard as his successful project. I already said how the star-crossed lovers met
3334920	3339000	through the rinse and repeat of Onision's twitter replies, now it's hard to say exactly what has
3339000	3343720	happened behind the scenes, but Onision cemented that loyalty in many ways over the years.
3343720	3348200	Throughout the various people entering and leaving their lives, Kai is the one who has remained
3348200	3353000	consistently by Onision's side. He's made a few statements himself, but mostly keeps off the
3353000	3358120	internet. Nonetheless, with the swarm of new allegations and details, it seems that he was
3358120	3363960	not just another victim. September the 14th of 2019 brought us Billy's testimony, and others
3363960	3368040	were not too far behind either. Billy stated that she was brought into the household under
3368040	3372200	the precipice of getting to know Kai. In fact, these DMs show Kai fully stating that Onision
3372200	3375960	would not be involved. However, this was soon contradicted by a conversation at the dinner
3375960	3380520	table where Greg proposed the idea of a three-way relationship. Billy also showed DMs of Greg
3380520	3384680	pressuring her to ask Kai out, once again paying credibility to the idea that this was one of
3384680	3389560	Greg's pursuits as well. In another statement, she talks about the cheating situation where Greg
3389640	3393720	states he's gonna do whatever he wants, and although Kai told Billy to not let it happen,
3393720	3398520	Kai then said to Greg that he can do whatever he wants. It basically set up the situation which
3398520	3402840	allowed them to blame Billy for the cheating that we spoke about earlier, and the subsequent
3402840	3407640	contract which was such a great idea. Kai's position appears in this as someone who may be
3407640	3412520	enabling Greg's behaviour, and not standing up for those around him, but also someone who may be
3412520	3416760	equally as afraid of Greg. One of the things that you can identify is that Greg often likes to
3416760	3421320	weaponise Kai and speak on behalf of him, regularly telling people how Kai feels in an
3421320	3426360	attempt to guilt trip individuals while seeming like a selfless husband, such as these emails
3426360	3434200	where he says that Kai's crying, and that's why you should care. Ah, my heart weeps. Kai is used
3434200	3439160	as a human shield for Greg's interests, a way to try and pull people back into his life, such as
3439160	3443960	these emails where he basically tells Billy that even if you hate him, you could at least come back
3443960	3449720	for Kai. What about Kai, guys? Kai also sent some emails to Billy, but as Billy noted, they
3449720	3454680	resembled Greg's language a lot, and seemed like another manipulation tactic. Many have noted Kai's
3454680	3460280	tendency to not just excuse Greg's behaviour, but even defend it. In a way, Onision has found his
3460280	3465400	perfect cult member. However, many also said they saw what Greg does to Kai, and if it's anything
3465400	3469400	like the other testimonies, then I'm more than willing to believe there may be a great deal of
3469400	3475400	turmoil involved. So far we know that Kai probably acts as a pawn, as a shield, and as an enabler,
3475400	3480920	but they're also all things that can be completely true of a victim, and people suffering from severe
3480920	3485640	mental entrapment. If it stopped here, then we might be able to draw some sort of line that Kai
3485640	3490840	just needs to break out of the mental clutches of Onision, and to an extent, he may still need to.
3490840	3496120	However, nonetheless, what will be spoken about next cannot easily be excused by even Gregory
3496120	3501800	Onion Man's manipulation. Often the most loyal cult members will be on a job to get new recruits,
3501800	3507720	and even mimic the behaviour of their leader. And well, if Onision had grooming problems, then
3507720	3513080	Kai wasn't too far behind. The first story comes from someone by the name of Regina, who wasn't
3513080	3517560	heavily involved in Greg's life, but was one of the first people who Kai started talking to.
3517560	3522440	Now this was before Kai was openly bisexual, and given his relatively small internet following,
3522440	3528040	a lot of people probably overlooked this. Regina had been watching since 2009, and they began DMing
3528040	3534200	in around 2012. There was a two year age gap here, with Regina being 15, and Kai being 17.
3534200	3538200	On the surface, you may be able to give that a pass. When you consider it in the context of the
3538200	3543640	next person, Sarah, and the greater plan that some people clearly had, then it does become worrying.
3543640	3547800	I would also add that some of the tweets would certainly raise a few eyebrows to say the least,
3547800	3553640	and Regina testifies that Kai had appeared topless in a Skype call, which is not good.
3553640	3558600	Regina was invited to Kai and Greg's wedding at one point, but their mother declined on behalf of them.
3558600	3567640	The first time I remember vividly was to come to visit for their wedding. I was young and I was very
3567640	3575800	into photography at the time. That was a really big aspiration of mine, and I would always show Kai
3575800	3582600	my pictures I took, and Kai said, would you want to take pictures for our wedding? Luckily, my mother
3582600	3588920	would not allow that to happen, and I never got a proper date on when the wedding would have been,
3589640	3594920	so they carried on without me. Probably for the better. There were also a lot of DMs released,
3594920	3599000	which, although may be typical in some relationships, this wasn't a relationship,
3599000	3603080	and with the context that this is more of a game to Kai than anything else, playing with these
3603080	3607640	younger person's feelings is pretty sickening. This has been alleged to have been repeated with
3607640	3611960	other people as well, even people not particularly well known to their channel, which is a tad
3611960	3617080	concerning considering how far this actually extends. However, if we do want someone a bit
3617080	3622200	more well known, we'll talk about Sarah. Obviously, as the person who set off this chain reaction,
3622200	3626600	it's appropriate that we end this where we started. Sarah, like Regina, like Billy,
3626600	3632760	met Kai first, back when Sarah was only 14, and Kai was 18. Now that's a gap that is slightly
3632760	3637960	more concerning, especially if there were implications, which there were. At this stage,
3637960	3642760	there was also a rather strange three-way dynamic. In this instance, I'll just let the tweets do the
3642760	3647640	talking because there isn't really too much subtext. However, as the years passed, Regina was
3647640	3653080	gradually pushed away. Despite wanting to remain in contact, it appears that Onision and Kai had set
3653080	3659000	their sights on both Billy and Sarah, with Kai crudely cutting Regina off in 2016, only bothering
3659000	3664600	to justify this in 2017, around the time of the controversy with Billy, I wonder why.
3665640	3671240	Reading the DMs is kinda sad to be honest, seeing Kai disregard the investment that Regina had,
3671240	3677240	that Kai cultivated, clearly discontinued for no discernible reason. Make no mistake,
3677240	3682040	it was for the best, but it shows you how much of a project this was, how they were willing to
3682040	3687720	discard people who they didn't feel fit in with their greater plan. It cemented what was ultimately
3687720	3693160	most insidious about this whole relationship, the fact that to me, Kai was being mobilised by Greg,
3693160	3697960	and maybe even to a degree of his own volition, to rope these people into their household,
3697960	3703400	and involve themselves with Greg in some additional twisted sexual way. We saw this with
3703400	3708280	Onision's own content with Billy, and we see it in the testimonies of people who would experience
3708280	3714040	both these unpleasant characters. In 2018, while still underage herself, Sarah states that Kai
3714040	3720280	sent her nudes, and although she was 17, so a bit older, Kai was 23. Truth and context prevailing,
3720280	3725400	these details leave a nasty taste in your mouth, and go firmly against this theory that Onision
3725400	3730600	and Kai considered her merely as a friend while she was a minor, alongside all the other evidence,
3730600	3735720	including this very romantic picture on girlfriend's day, and of course, these hilarious old tweets
3735720	3741720	about grooming individuals. Such great banter. Kai did make live streams defending himself at the
3741720	3746920	time, but with a clearer documentation of the evidence, those defences haven't aged very well at all.
3764920	3769080	To add to this, additional people came forward stating that they had similar experiences,
3769080	3773240	while those individuals called Hayley showed additional DMs in which Greg attempted to pressure
3773240	3778600	into a relationship with Kai. He once again talks on behalf of Kai, and is very coercive in his language.
3778600	3784280	It's the same story, Hayley started talking to Kai, and not too long after our friend Gregory moves in.
3784280	3788680	In this instance, Hayley declines, and notes that she feels like she's being used as a distraction,
3788680	3793880	which she probably is to an extent, but looking at the pattern, what it represents is much greater.
3793880	3798280	To many of Greg's accusers, Kai was the gateway drug to Onision's worst behaviour.
3798280	3802600	He has regularly roped in others under the precipice of something more casual and friendly,
3802600	3807480	maybe a nice little romantic thing between two people, but it hasn't been long before other forces
3807480	3812120	have come into play. When I first started reading the testimonies, I was open to consider that maybe
3812120	3816760	Kai was just a person under Greg's influence, given how much control he likes to wager,
3816760	3820920	but I don't believe that Kai is without his investments, and the amount of emotional upset
3821000	3825800	that this has caused does not give many people reason to exhume Kai of his own responsibility.
3825800	3829800	In the recent months, Kai has spent a large proportion of his time off social media,
3829800	3833560	and we might get a bit more into that in the future, but whether he's here or not,
3833560	3838040	the consequences of his actions remain the same. Let's wrap this part up then.
3838040	3855800	I want to emphasize that this is not every last detail. There are many more people with many more
3855800	3861560	claims, and the fact that I've chosen to cover the ones I have today does not necessarily discount
3861560	3866360	any others, but I think the stories we've covered today tell us what we need to know about Onision
3866360	3871640	and his behavior. In the first part we covered how Onision cultivates a cult status, in this part
3871640	3876520	we've spoken about how many have been entangled in this web, and how it has subsequently affected
3876520	3881880	them personally. Greg's outward demeanor expressed in a few select videos may have captured people's
3881880	3887720	attention, his openness and accessibility may have made people feel endeared, they may have reached
3887720	3892920	out to him in the hope of filling a hole created by their own vulnerabilities, but Greg wasn't
3892920	3898200	interested in that. He was interested in finding and pinpointing the weakness, exploiting it, and
3898200	3902680	making people attached to him so that he could use it for his own gain. There were many various
3902680	3907960	psychological tactics he would employ to make sure that this was facilitated. In a way, he's a bit like
3907960	3912680	Pennywise, depending on a person's proximity, their behavior, and the way they reacted to him,
3912680	3917560	he would manifest into various forms of himself, often with mind to which one would be the most
3917560	3922280	successful, and when he was faced down with defeat from individuals like Sky, he would malfunction and
3922280	3927160	try becoming everything at once, but unfortunately, many people did fall for the versions of himself
3927160	3932440	that he presented multiple times, and went back, often to more suffering. He would typically use his
3932440	3937080	channel to portray a narrative that he was this person, trying to help others out when they were
3937080	3942520	merely struggling, and he ended up on the wrong end of things, but behind the scenes, he was the
3942520	3948200	instigator of that exact conflict. This content would be used to deceive his fans, and even his
3948200	3952920	partners, into probably believing that they may share some blame, and it only took distance
3952920	3957960	and sobriety to realize the influence that he controlled over them. In the meantime, Onision
3957960	3962120	would often use his platform to control the narrative over them, when he had exhausted all
3962120	3966600	his methods of entrapment, he'll switch his narrative over how awful these people actually
3966600	3972120	were for him, often showing himself as blameless, but also vulnerable, maybe in a way to encourage
3972120	3977400	other people to reach out. This didn't work for a while until the person named Kai, I'm not sure if
3977400	3981800	Greg did anything exceptionally differently. He started the relationship by showing his commitment,
3981800	3986040	kept it down to the critical public art as long as possible, and moved in to cement the loyalty
3986040	3991080	as soon as possible. Kai was just the first person to be completely complicit, it seems. He stood by
3991080	3995960	Greg under a large majority of criticisms, under a large majority of circumstances, and eventually
3995960	4001000	became Player 2 in the Onision game, continuing to pull in new victims who would be subjected to
4001000	4005080	more of Greg's mental formula. When they pulled away, they'd be regularly subjected to Greg's
4005080	4009800	deluge of public and private rants which were designed to swear pinion in his favour,
4009800	4014920	a position that he could now take comfortably with a spouse already by his side. Overall, this
4014920	4019240	formula was predominantly successful for the approval of those that Onision concerned himself
4019240	4023800	with, and even when it failed, it would typically not amount to anything more. However, in recent
4023800	4028840	months, with the universal sentiment against Greg mounting, and his hesitancy and subsequent failure
4028840	4033480	to actually attempt to control what was being said, combined with some old enemies returning,
4033480	4037880	the allegations against him finally organised themselves in a comprehensive fashion where the
4037880	4042520	discussion changed from who was in the right, to what punishment is suitable for this behaviour.
4042520	4047080	Greg's position of being accused of various heinous behaviours before, in many ways, shouldn't
4047080	4051800	be the most unfamiliar territory for him, but this time it's been coordinated in a way that makes the
4051800	4056600	claims insurmountable, and whereas there was a level of grey in the past, many have felt that
4056600	4062200	today's evidence has proven beyond any doubt that Onision's behaviour as a creator, and as a person
4062200	4067560	has been unequivocally deplorable. Fortunately, in September of 2019, and the following months,
4067560	4071880	many people came forward to illuminate his treatment of them, and others around them. Videos
4071880	4077400	began to gain more traction, and more commentators jumped on the topic, thus providing more publicity.
4077400	4081640	With the walls closing in, and more spotlights coming onto him, not just from the YouTube sphere,
4081640	4087080	he began to capitulate in ways unseen, yet many still feel that there is unfinished business given
4087080	4093080	his actions. Join me for the final part of this painful saga, as I go into the fall of Onision,
4093080	4098440	his responses, and how they've evolved in the last year. However, it won't be just that, so I also plan
4098440	4103640	to delve into, and deconstruct his broken philosophy, and make the argument for why his place on this
4103640	4105880	platform should be seriously reconsidered.
4108840	4114920	So yes, that was the video, that was a great fun video, I wanna give a big shout out to the editors,
4114920	4119880	because if they've had to experience this as much as I have, then they'll probably be reeling too,
4119880	4125080	and they deserve credit for their commitment. Heaven knows we need it sometimes. I also wanna give
4125080	4131880	big thanks to my Patreons, my $10 patreons are on screen right now, they do a fantastic job.
4131880	4138120	I also need to give big thanks to my $50 patreons, some hullabaloo Nico Deschamps and Caroline,
4138120	4143960	with a very special thanks to my $100 patreons Brandon and Stanton. Thank you guys for your
4143960	4150280	support, it is deeply appreciated, especially in times like these. If you wanna reach me,
4150280	4155480	reach me on Twitter, at TheRightOpinion, reach me on Facebook, TheRightOpinionOfficial,
4155480	4162280	reach me on Discord, link in the pinned comments, and even Instagram though, I'm obviously,
4162280	4167720	my life isn't exciting enough for that a lot of the time, but I have fun at least. Don't really have
4167720	4172120	too much else to add, I wanna thank everyone for the support of recent, and this will probably be
4172120	4177000	the first video after Christmas, though my first video of this will probably be out on Christmas
4177000	4182360	day, so I just wanna say that I hope everyone's had a good year, and let's hope for better things
4183080	4186600	in 2020. Other than that, I don't really have too much else to say,
4187240	4190200	and I'm TheRightOpinion, I'll see you in the next one.
4202120	4210360	Bye!
