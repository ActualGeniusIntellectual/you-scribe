1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,120
So if any of you see someone spreading creepy, perverted things that they made up in their

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:10,000
mind about my life, about Lainey's life, about Sarah's life, you can send them the link to

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,640
this video to expose how incredibly stupid and gross they are.

4
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,000
Kill her, God.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,320
I don't even know if I can do this.

6
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,480
Like, please leave me alone.

7
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,040
Like, I've asked.

8
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:33,120
I asked you to stop using my name and my information in your videos.

9
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,080
And you told me that you would.

10
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,680
You asked me to stop contacting you.

11
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,080
And again, today you posted a video.

12
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:12,800
Hello, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome back to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time,

13
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:18,720
and I hope you are settled in today as you join me to enjoy this second installment on this wonderful series.

14
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,680
If you haven't watched my first video, I would implore you to do so, not just for context's sake, but for

15
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,680
the entertainment value as well.

16
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,080
However, if you did join me, you'll know through the measures of controversy and the intertwining of

17
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:35,520
narratives, the subject of today's video cultivated and crafted an audience incredibly carefully, one that

18
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,560
was catered to him only, and then used that audience in question to solicit various favours.

19
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,720
It was a game of control to our onion friend.

20
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:48,160
However, if it had stopped there, we may just call him out for being an exploitative creator to a worse

21
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:52,480
degree than normal, of which there are a few on the platform.

22
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,760
No, you see, it wasn't just a control thing over his audience, it was something that he wanted to bring into

23
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:03,120
his personal life, and that which could be found in all of his relationships, often to a degree in which

24
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,720
questions would be asked.

25
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:09,600
That's where we're going now, and I don't think this part needs too much of an intro, I suggest we make like

26
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,520
DeFranco and jump right in.

27
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,520
If you watched my part on Jay Albury's video, you'll likely know that I have the displeasure of researching

28
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,040
a large majority of Onision's relationships while on YouTube.

29
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,520
Back then, however, it was a matter of tackling the subject from the standpoint of neutrality.

30
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,920
Now we are back on my channel, and we have already discussed a strong level of theory as it is,

31
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,520
I feel we can take the evidence that was shown, and use it more inductively.

32
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:39,920
Onision is a control freak, he wants to shape his life around the fantasies, many of which involve YouTube,

33
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:45,680
and involve people. Having control over a fanbase is one thing, having control over a partner is another.

34
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,480
As said, physical proximity works in very significant ways, and by creating relationships he can

35
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:56,080
manufacture new conflicts to present to his audience, but he had his preference on the younger side.

36
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:01,360
I don't know if his choice to enter relationships with younger girls was a kink thing, or more a control thing,

37
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:06,800
but going after people who are lacking direction in a vulnerable position, and open to receiving support

38
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,920
from someone, often led Onision to relationships with those between the ages of 16 and 18,

39
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:17,760
though there is deviation. Over the years, as he aged, and as he got through a fair few relationships,

40
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:23,520
the age gap increased, showing that he was still targeting the same people. What exactly did he want?

41
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,720
Let's talk about the relationships of Onision.

42
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,400
Onision's relationships while he was on the platform started with a person he was actually married to prior

43
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,280
to the creation of his YouTube account, a person named Sky. This relationship, despite Greg's habits

44
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,400
of putting all his problems about it on the internet, did seem to be mildly functional at one point.

45
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:48,080
However, all this began to fall apart when a new individual was introduced to his life. Her name is Shiloh.

46
00:03:49,040 --> 00:04:01,200
Shiloh was a Canadian punk artist who actually had a charting hit at one point, it kinda slaps,

47
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:07,040
even if it's a tad dated. However, in 2010, she was pulled into the Onision rabbit hole. Shiloh allegedly

48
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:12,640
started looking into Greg's channel after seeing his I'm a Banana video on TV, truly a love story

49
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:17,360
for the ages. They began communicating, they developed a friendship, that friendship eventually

50
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:22,960
turned into an emotional affair, and by the end of 2010, Greg drafts up the divorce papers for Sky.

51
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,440
The original divorce documents are shown here, they included the assertion that Sky forfeited

52
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:32,400
her homeownership rights, and that Greg would pay her $1000 a month for 12 months if she moved out.

53
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:38,480
Greg has regularly cited this and claimed that Sky did not honour this signed contract, but Sky has responded

54
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:43,440
saying that given she signed the contract under emotional stress and verbal abuse delivered by her friend

55
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:49,440
Gregory here, the court predetermined it as null. Now, there are a load of messy details regarding his divorce,

56
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:54,320
and it's trimmed to Sky that is a much more in-depth story that we will partly cover soon, but the truth is

57
00:04:54,320 --> 00:05:00,000
that it seems she was not invested in his YouTube channel in a way that he wanted her to be, and Shiloh was,

58
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,480
so for him it was not a difficult decision, and once he had demonstrated his commitment to Shiloh

59
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:09,840
less than a few months after the divorce, Onision introduced Shiloh in his Onision's Girlfriend video.

60
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:16,560
All very jolly and joyous, but this does not last, as this relationship quickly devolves into rather grim

61
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,680
territory. One of the first controversies occurs with the video Shiloh Forgot Me, when Shiloh allegedly suffers

62
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:27,680
a seizure which invokes memory loss. Onision decides to film it and upload it to YouTube like many normal people would.

63
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:38,720
Onision's Girlfriend video.

64
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:43,600
Unsurprisingly, the then normal people in his audience called him out for this, apparently there were people

65
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,320
in his audience with sense. He deleted the video due to backlash, but also uploaded a video called

66
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,800
I Respect Her Wishes, in which he defends the decision to not have her see a medical professional,

67
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,600
because they had already worked it out themselves.

68
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:02,080
The reason I didn't call an ambulance is because I wouldn't want someone to call an ambulance on me if I lost my memory.

69
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:07,040
I don't see what doctors are going to do to help Shiloh.

70
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:13,840
As mentioned, this distrust in medical professionals isn't coincidental, he didn't want anyone actually advising on his personal life,

71
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,920
especially people who are astute enough to see what is going on.

72
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:22,840
The saga then continued barely a couple months later when he uploaded videos called Shiloh Threaten Me and The Truth,

73
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:28,880
which both frame his then ex-girlfriend as unstable. In between this, he has another relationship with a person called Adrian,

74
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:35,880
and this is when Onision uploaded the videos, which led many people to question whether he was suffering from borderline personality disorder or not.

75
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:50,040
Onision's relationship didn't work out, I'm gonna be single for some time, and I have no idea if I'm even willing to put another girl through the rollercoaster that is Onision,

76
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:58,520
because I am a douchebag. Truth is, I don't think he did, I think Adrian was a person that Onision had more trouble controlling than most,

77
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:03,800
and therefore took to social media to attempt to manipulate her back with public show's remorse and regret.

78
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:07,000
He was looking for a new person to play his game, and Adrian didn't.

79
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:19,800
And I don't even want to point a single finger of blame at Adrian. She's a nice lady. She really is. She deserves someone much more like herself, not like me.

80
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:32,920
Because, I don't know, we're just so not compatible, it's ridiculous. And it was my mistake for... Well, it was my mistake for being a dick.

81
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:40,360
As this crumbled pretty quickly, he left a string of failed endeavours to win her back, including numerous voicemails that would eventually become very notorious

82
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:44,920
and symbolic of Greg's attempt to reconcile relationships that he was losing grip of.

83
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:51,480
And, just so you know, everything I said publicly, there were never attacks on you. I was just living my life.

84
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:57,400
Like, it's kinda like how you were just living your life when you had the same essential massage. You were just being you.

85
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:05,480
I know I was busy blaming you for a lot of stuff, but that's not my fault.

86
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:12,840
Fortunately for Onision, it wasn't too long before Shiloh got back together with him, and this gave him a platform to publicly call out Adrian,

87
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,560
even implying she had STDs.

88
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:28,840
The home that I ended up in was smaller than the first home. It's much prettier. Much more clean.

89
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:36,520
He likely did this out of business because he couldn't control her, but also now he had Shiloh back, he felt secure in having another person he could take advantage of,

90
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:39,080
and believe me, he really did go to town this time.

91
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:44,360
Firstly, there was the issue that Shiloh was expecting. Originally, Onision did this weird celebratory video,

92
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:49,320
and then there was this miscarriage, and then Onision uploads a video announcing Shiloh has sepsis,

93
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:53,720
then he removes it and re-uploads it to his archive channel, blaming Shiloh for lying to him,

94
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:58,520
and then Shiloh goes back to Canada for treatment regarding her case, and once again she is beyond reach.

95
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:04,040
So what does Greg do? Well, he goes back to being sulky, sad, and forlorn. He uploads a goodbye Shiloh video,

96
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:10,280
and makes multiple sad hour posts into the public sphere. Also in this time, Shiloh's mother mercifully hides her passport,

97
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:15,880
and although Onision sends Shiloh money to purchase a new one, she does not. Maybe she worked out what was good for her.

98
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:22,600
Onision also starts multiple feuds with his other exes in this time, I assume to try and show some sort of proxy loyalty.

99
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:28,280
He's off attacking his exes, and yet only has commitment to Shiloh and everything she represents.

100
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:34,360
Sounds a bit sketchy, does it not? Well, let's sketch a little more to create an even clearer picture.

101
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:45,960
Onision misses Shiloh so much, and he's once again showing how loyal he is, but she is gradually slipping away.

102
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:50,280
Greg seems to have this algorithm of measuring how worthwhile the pursuit of a relationship is.

103
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:54,440
In Shiloh's absence, he clearly felt, to an extent, there was something redeemable,

104
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:59,160
they had a breakup the year before where Shiloh went back to him as mentioned, and so in my opinion,

105
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:04,760
Onision viewed a repeat of that completely viable, thus explaining all this sad regret posting.

106
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:10,440
As said, Shiloh's mother hid her passport, and some distance had clearly given Shiloh time to make her mind up,

107
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:14,520
and eventually, at the start of February, Shiloh and Onision ended their relationship.

108
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:19,960
Immediately, however, Onision's tune changed, very shortly after he released a video called It's Over,

109
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:24,200
suddenly calling Shiloh out for all her lies, in musical form of course.

110
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:49,960
Now once again, it's plausible to say that Onision may have had a revelation himself,

111
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:55,240
but really what followed felt rather contrived, added on top of the fact that when Shiloh admitted to

112
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:59,480
quote, emotionally cheating on Greg when confronted with various pieces of evidence,

113
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:05,320
Greg once again used this to emphasise how evil Shiloh was, branding her as cheating scum,

114
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:10,520
and although of course that sort of behaviour isn't endorsed, it's hard to ignore the fact that as far as he knew

115
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:17,400
at that point, Shiloh did to him exactly what he did to Sky with Shiloh, which was basically overlapping

116
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:22,840
the end of a previous relationship with the start of a new one. So his fury seems somewhat hypocritical

117
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:27,800
and contrived to say the least, even more so considering the drama that would occur a few years later,

118
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:33,160
but we'll get to that in a bit. None of Greg's reactions ever seem particularly natural, everything seems

119
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:38,600
designed to elicit some outcome he desires, which often requires swinging between contradictory

120
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:43,800
standpoints. It seems he will do his best to maintain control over a person until they are out of reach,

121
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:47,560
and then flip the switch. Let's talk about that a little more then.

122
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:52,680
Alright, so we've had a decent analysis of a large amount of real-time evidence thus far,

123
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:56,840
this is what was observed at the time, but there's still a lot more to discuss.

124
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:02,600
Onision was not a man with great ambitions, he just wanted to control you under every circumstance,

125
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:07,480
and when you weren't under his control, he'd play a variety of mental games, I think you can categorise

126
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:13,080
them into the five stages of Onision relationships. The first one was bait, he'd reach out to people in a

127
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:17,720
caring way, perhaps even in a vulnerable way that would suggest that he needs someone, he needs a

128
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:22,360
person to a reasonable extent. This tricks the unfortunate person into believing that they would

129
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:27,000
have some conducive role to play in Onision's life. Onision is also a person with a decent amount of

130
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,760
resources, so if you can help him, maybe you can be a part of his kingdom, how inspiring. And then

131
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:37,160
he shows you how committed he is, he invests in you, he makes you feel like he cares about you

132
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:41,560
specifically, he spends time and money to come and see you, and before you know it, you're in his

133
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:47,320
arms, and you can live out his dreams together. Of course, I emphasise, his dreams, not yours.

134
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:52,120
Over the first few years on this time on YouTube, it's clear he wanted someone he could use in a way

135
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:57,480
that he wanted to, someone who he could manufacture conflicts around, and with Shiloh, he really found

136
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:02,520
that, he found someone who would play his games, someone who would play into the drama, threats, and

137
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:21,560
testimonies. Then comes the third phase, if you're lucky you have some distance from Onision,

138
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:26,440
he suddenly feels remorseful, he misses you so much, he's afraid he might never find another

139
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:31,320
girl like you again, you weren't like all those other women, they didn't compare to you, you were

140
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:36,680
special, he's gonna post all these sad statuses onto the internet, he might even upload a video or two.

141
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:07,000
Sometimes this might pull you back to stage 2, but also, the distance might allow you to see the

142
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,240
situation more clearly, and finally make a decision that you don't want to ever interact with him

143
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,640
again, and that's when we reach stage 4.

144
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:35,240
Suddenly, in fact, you were just like all those who came before you, you were a cheat, you were

145
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:41,000
a slut, you were a liar, you were taking his money, you probably had STDs for all he's concerned about,

146
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,040
and now Onision is mad, because he thought you were different, and now he's gonna stress to his

147
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:52,040
audience that you weren't, and you hurt him just like the rest, and now he's so broken, oh and now

148
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:57,400
he wishes that someone would come and rescue him, oh if only there was someone out there who would

149
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:02,760
save him. Meanwhile you're sat there, shell shocked from the relationship, and you just wish he would

150
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:09,560
stop talking about you. He did this with everyone the audience could identify, primarily with Sky,

151
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:14,360
Adrian, and Shiloh in the first few years, he simultaneously would keep in contact with them,

152
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:19,320
while demonising and shading them at every possible opportunity. Eventually many of these girls would

153
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:24,680
reach the fifth stage, but I will talk about that in due time, I think I have more than enough.

154
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:35,560
Onision had an assemblage of individuals who either partially or went through this arc, and that was

155
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:40,680
because he wanted them to play his game, and many of them, although vulnerable, did have some sense

156
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:45,720
to escape this. However this changed when we introduced the character called Kai. Kai, who was

157
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:50,760
Lainey upon meeting Greg, is Onision's current husband, and another highly controversial person

158
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:54,920
whose details we'll delve into in a bit. Onision- I proposed to her in probably the least classy way

159
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:59,080
possible, I proposed to her via video over the internet, in such a weird way, I basically said it

160
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:04,520
like this, you know I'm gonna marry you right? That's how I did it. Like many of the people who

161
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:09,720
Onision involved himself with, Kai found his future husband through the fan infatuation,

162
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:15,320
and like a jigsaw falling into place when Onision put out one of his post Shiloh tweets asking where

163
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:21,400
his soulmate was, Kai replied here, and Onision, smelling the potential from a mile away like a

164
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:27,480
blissfully basted Christmas turkey, moved into the DMs, asking why he exactly felt this way,

165
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:32,280
so the communication elaborates, and a new relationship begins to flourish. Of course,

166
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:36,520
this relationship is kept private, likely because Kai was underage at the time.

167
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:41,320
As the cycle begins, Onision wants to show his commitment to Kai, but this time the relationship

168
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:45,480
takes a slightly different approach. Whether Onision had identified that Kai was pretty

169
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:50,840
infatuated as it was, he proposed to him less than a month after they started dating. This

170
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:55,720
sort of thing may have felt romantic to someone like Kai, but as Onision probably recognised,

171
00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:00,280
it placed a lot of pressure on him to be committed to the relationship, and saying yes would tighten

172
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:05,560
their bond in a very special way, and Kai said yes, and Greg moves out to New Mexico to live

173
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:10,120
with Kai. A fair few people notice this, and although he avoids the topic, some people begin

174
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:14,360
to put the dots together. After a bit of back and forth where it fluctuates between being long

175
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:19,320
distance and close proximity, Onision rents out a place to secretly live with Kai while his parents

176
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:24,040
are under the impression that Kai is staying at college. Kai turns 18, and less than a month later

177
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:28,440
they are married and living together in Washington. Now of course, this relationship wasn't without

178
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:32,840
its drama, but it was mainly related to loyalty, which says more than enough. In this time,

179
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:37,000
Onision also impregnates Kai, and they have a child, and they also have another child later

180
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,720
by the way. Now reflecting back on Kai though, it wouldn't surprise me if Onision saw having children

181
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:46,840
as a way to cement that loyalty, and increase the cost of leaving him to Kai. On top of this,

182
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:51,720
Onision had feuds with Kai's family over their very legitimate concerns. I didn't think this was

183
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:55,960
particularly relevant at first, but these feuds would distance Kai from his family, thus making

184
00:17:55,960 --> 00:18:01,240
him and Greg more isolated in their relationship, thus once again affirming this theory of control.

185
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:04,760
Onision- Mr. Grump wanted to meet me at Olive Garden. We'll say that's in Olive. Does that even

186
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:09,080
show up on this? Stupid green. So Mr. Grump is sitting across the table from me at Olive Garden.

187
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:12,280
Our conversation was kind of chill at first, but then his eyes started turning red, and he started

188
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:15,880
getting teary, because Mr. Grump decided to threaten my well-being. Despite my relationship

189
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:19,640
with Laney being legal, he also threatened to put me in prison. Despite, again, our relationship

190
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:23,480
being totally legal. So he threatened to seriously harm me and possibly kill me, as well as threaten

191
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:28,200
me in other ways. F that guy. That was a reference to Greg's father-in-law, by the way. Delightful.

192
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:34,200
By 2015, everything seemed to be going fairly solid. They were one real happy family. However,

193
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:38,840
happiness seldom lasts forever, and the beginning of what has led up to the events that we observe

194
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:43,960
today was about to occur. I suggest we talk about the next stage of this relationship.

195
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:49,080
He's sitting across the table from him, and he's probably going to threaten to sue me for this

196
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:52,040
video. He's already threatened to sue me before, but that's fine. I'm allowed to tell stories

197
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:58,600
about people without using faces or names, etc. But he was being hard on me for my age

198
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:04,760
gap with Laney, and I had a nine-year age gap with Laney. And he told me to come back in 10 years,

199
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:09,960
like, not till Laney was 25, to date Laney. And I was just, like, thinking, how much power does

200
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:17,160
this guy think he has? Like, this is kind of nuts. Back in 10 years, like, not till Laney was 25.

201
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:21,000
Back in 10 years, like, not till Laney was 25.

202
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:26,840
Back in 10 years, like, not till Laney was 25.

203
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:33,800
Wait, what? I'm gonna hope that was an error on his part, and, uh, continue regardless.

204
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:44,120
Onision gives me the impression that he has this stage of plans in his head, and once one is

205
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:48,760
satisfied, he can move on to the next. So now we have this marriage with a person who was clearly

206
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:53,240
rather attached to him, he then moved on to exploring another character for their Fifty Shades

207
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:59,240
of Fukuri. Most of this probably occurred initially in 2015, though it was definitely conceived prior.

208
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:04,520
It seems that this plan involved finding other younger individuals, and involving them in their

209
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:09,480
little project. Now, I'm going to save the spiciest details until the end, but there is a lot on our plate,

210
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,160
so it's best we get started now.

211
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,520
Hehe, boi.

212
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:17,160
In this time, Greg and Kai had reached out to various girls, however, none would really enter the public

213
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:22,840
light until a person by the name of Billy. During 2015, Kai comes out as bisexual and genderqueer,

214
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:28,840
and by the end of 2015, Billy begins talking to Kai privately, and very soon, Gregory becomes involved,

215
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:34,120
encouraging Billy to date Kai. Now I know what you're thinking, wait, isn't Greg married to Kai?

216
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,440
Well, yes. You know that clip earlier?

217
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,560
I'm coming for you.

218
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,400
Come to me.

219
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,160
Almost there.

220
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:44,520
Wait, what?

221
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,280
That's right, baby.

222
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,480
Your lips taste like cherry.

223
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,040
Oh my god, no.

224
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:56,440
This feels so right without whiskers. No more sandpaper except down there.

225
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,520
Mm-hmm, that's where we're approaching.

226
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:02,920
Onision clearly had a phase where his kicks were derived from publicly watching himself be

227
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:08,200
Now of course, if someone wants to upload that content onto YouTube, then they're allowed to,

228
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:13,160
as embarrassing and pathetic as it may seem to me. However, there was more degeneracy to come,

229
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:18,040
as Kai apparently didn't consent for Greg and Billy to date, and when Greg got a bit too

230
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:22,600
intimate with Billy in an instant known as Cuddlegate, the relationship temporarily broke

231
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:27,800
down which led to the legendary I Betrayed My Wife video, once again highlighting Onision's

232
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,840
nature of publicly self-shaming when it's beneficial for him.

233
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:34,040
Now I told Lani what happened and it ripped everything apart. I was stupid and I thought

234
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:37,000
that cuddling and a full body massage was harmless. Lani's position is, it wasn't the

235
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,720
cuddling and it definitely wasn't the full body massage. It was really all about the fact that

236
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:43,240
she clearly indicated she did not want me cuddling with this person, yet I manipulated my way into

237
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:46,680
cuddling with her anyway, so she saw a huge betrayal in that. After distancing Billy for

238
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:51,240
a bit and trolling her with a fake video before exposing her text, expressing feelings, and

239
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:56,520
framing her as a homewrecker, Onision and Kai once again tighten their bond. However, after this

240
00:21:56,520 --> 00:22:01,560
extremely stressful and tense ordeal, they did what any rational couple would do and gradually

241
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:07,640
began integrating Billy back into their life. This occurred over 2016, and eventually this contrived

242
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:12,040
love triangle was reignited, but this love triangle was also very quickly extinguished

243
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:17,000
again by the end of November with the Onision video titled We Broke Up. However, it wasn't

244
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,400
actually over and they got back together in December, and then they broke up again in January

245
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:25,800
with another set of videos, one from Billy's side illuminating Onision's tendency to have

246
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:30,840
weird sexual motivations amongst many other things. Alongside this were some beautiful DMs

247
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,920
and a video explaining her perspective.

248
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:41,240
So, Onision, please stop harassing me and my best friend. I am tired of seeing your tweets,

249
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:45,800
tired of being tagged in your tweets of you just harassing us, telling us we're awful,

250
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:49,160
druggy people. Please leave me alone.

251
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:53,880
Because of this, she got the full Onision Stage 4 treatment with a 40 minute video that has

252
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:58,360
tragically been eviscerated from the internet. But it seems that Onision wasn't happy with just

253
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:03,320
framing her as a homewrecker, no, he went in alleging that she was a full-blown criminal,

254
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:08,600
which is slightly ironic, but I digress. What was this crime? Well, it was indulging in the

255
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:12,120
Devil's Lettuce, which was against the contract he had written up.

256
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:16,600
Now you may understand why I personally dumped Billy for committing a crime in the state of

257
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:20,520
Virginia. Here's the contract I proposed. He also had some additional comments to make.

258
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:25,560
You're a bad person, a liar, an illegal drug user. You were raised by criminals. You lied

259
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:31,000
to us repeatedly. You, a person who scores lower on IQ tests, who didn't even graduate high school.

260
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,080
You cheated on my wife. You act like you're the victim. You got dumped so many times.

261
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:39,640
You're awful, druggy people. You do illegal drugs in the state of Virginia. You are a cheater,

262
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:45,000
Billy. And you lie, an awful druggy. So I told her to get a tramp stamp of I'm a liar

263
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,760
because she's a liar. Now, once again, might be a controversial opinion,

264
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:54,040
but I personally find writing a contract up for a relationship slightly stranger than smoking

265
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:58,760
weed, and using that in the title as if it makes for a terrible person. Technically speaking,

266
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:03,480
if she was in breach of a contractual agreement, then you could be obliged to terminate the

267
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:07,640
relationship, but I don't think relationships should be built on contracts regardless.

268
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:13,640
And anyway, it was clear this was a move motivated by the desire for control, something that Billy

269
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:18,040
had expressed herself. I do also hypothesize that this may have been a case of liability.

270
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:21,800
As we know, Onision keeps tabs through the law very closely, and given that he was a more

271
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:25,880
experienced adult, it's possible that he was aware that if there was an incident with the law, and he

272
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:30,440
was linked back to the case, he would be held more severely accountable. A contract may help him avoid

273
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:35,640
that, as sad and tragic as it is. I personally think Onision has a habit of turning legal concerns

274
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:39,880
into moral concerns, often as a way to boost his own credentials. Fortunately for many people,

275
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:44,200
they realized that marijuana indulgence wasn't really the worst thing, and didn't really justify

276
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:49,080
the stream of vitriolic abuse that Greg heard of Billy. Billy was another person who just couldn't

277
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:53,080
tolerate it any further. Billy's decision was also backed by another person called Ayala,

278
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:57,480
so she reposed his ex-girlfriend, who Greg had some previous conflicts with. Her video demanding

279
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:00,640
that Onision cease and desist is actually still up.

280
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:06,520
Like, please leave me alone like I've asked. I asked you to stop using my name and my information in your videos,

281
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:11,400
and you told me that you would. You asked me to stop contacting you, and again, today you posted a video

282
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:17,960
with a screenshot of our email conversation with my name in it, and like, obviously,

283
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,760
you think that you're right and justified in all the things that you're doing, and no,

284
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:26,120
I don't feel bad for the fact that I smoked weed, but it is scary.

285
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:30,920
This drama was definitely one of the first situations where the cracks began to really appear,

286
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:35,320
and commentary channels began to take notice too, and although many of them didn't provide the most

287
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:40,520
inspiring commentary, attention and publicity are always important. With Kai by his side, Onision

288
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:44,920
didn't need to worry about being alone, so this made him more confrontational, and more dismissive

289
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:49,640
of those he felt did him wrong, and anyway, he had another great friend too, a person by the name of

290
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:55,160
Sarah, and boy oh boy, they were really doing a favour for her. So emerging from the very stressful

291
00:25:55,160 --> 00:26:00,040
drama that Onision was clearly bothered by, he thought the best thing to do was to make a video

292
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:04,680
responding to other people that were bothering him regarding another situation relating to a person

293
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:11,800
by the name of Sarah. Now Sarah hadn't been involved in too much drama herself, she wasn't

294
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:17,080
a person particularly indulgent in conflict, and there was no public falling out, so what was the

295
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:22,200
problem? So I posted a picture to Instagram of myself just hanging out in a car with Sarah today,

296
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:28,200
and I got a lot of familiar comments. Why are you living with a 16 year old? Ah, Sarah was 16,

297
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:33,160
and at the time, she was living with Onision and Kai. Was that really the best idea? Well,

298
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:38,040
according to the individuals of interest, it was. Sarah was from what appeared to be a rather

299
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:42,520
troubled household, she had been following Kai since a couple years prior, and had began speaking

300
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:48,360
to him when she was 14. However, by the end of 2016, her home life appeared to have deteriorated,

301
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:54,040
and apparently, in an extremely low and vulnerable moment, Kai and Onision offered their home as a

302
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:59,160
safe haven for a girl who felt like she had no other option. Now many may ask why they didn't

303
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:04,200
look at other, less radical options, or perhaps understand the situation more carefully than just

304
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:10,280
rushing in and basically temporarily adopting this person, and to that, I'd say, good question.

305
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:15,160
As we know, Onision doesn't like to involve himself with the authorities. If you're wondering

306
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:20,840
why people didn't call Onision out for that at the time, well, it's because he wouldn't really say.

307
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:25,160
Onision- You may ask why she's living with us. Well, this is where I kind of hit a roadblock,

308
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:29,720
because we're talking about Sarah's private life, which she doesn't want to share with all of you,

309
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:33,720
and she has a right to not have that shared with you. In fact, I told her I was going to make this

310
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:38,520
video, and she very clearly communicated that she doesn't want people to know about her private

311
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:43,880
life. So because she clearly showed disinterest in me sharing her private life, slash information

312
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:48,520
about why she's here with all of you, I feel it's not appropriate for me to speak further of it.

313
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:52,600
This was the best option for him. Although he states it was in Sarah's best interests,

314
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:57,160
it was also in his best interests, giving the audience as little information regarding these

315
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:01,560
stories gives people less scope to pick them apart, and if people tried to pry too much,

316
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:06,840
he'd be able to accuse them of being intrusive, and not respecting Sarah's privacy. How dare you

317
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:12,920
do that? But hey, you know, it was a misguided favour maybe, but nothing remotely implicative,

318
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:18,680
and anyone claiming so were creeps. You people were the real perverts. This man who has done

319
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:25,160
nothing more than direct his own fetish films has kindly taken in a 16 year old from a troubled

320
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:29,880
household. You should be grateful that he's out here doing God's work.

321
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:34,520
But because you guys are so perverted, and because your minds are so screwed up,

322
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:39,480
you just make up all these creepy scenarios, and you go spreading them around the internet

323
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:43,480
as if they're the truth. So to those people, understand that I've consistently discussed

324
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:47,960
about the fantasies that you create inside your head about my life.

325
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:53,800
Yeah, you stick it to them Gregory, you put them in their place. All this around the same time as

326
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:58,840
this drama that Billy and Ayala are stirring quite frantically, it all becomes quite hard to follow

327
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:05,240
for many viewers, but the facts remain that something was up. In February 2017, Kai and Sarah

328
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:10,360
conducted a live stream to decry the allegations, and generally Onision and Party were mainly

329
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,840
focused on preventing this perception from spreading.

330
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:35,400
So not too long after, Sarah went back to her home, but then she came back less than a couple

331
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:39,800
months later in April, and then she went home again, and a few months later she came back again

332
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,760
in August, and then she went home again in November.

333
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:48,360
So if any of you see someone spreading creepy perverted things that they made up in their mind

334
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:53,720
about my life, about Lainey's life, about Sarah's life, you can send them the link to this video to

335
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:57,240
expose how incredibly stupid and gross they are.

336
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:01,960
In the video defending his perspective, Onision creates this strawman that people have a problem

337
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:06,280
with the fact that they're living with a 16 year old, which I'm not sure is the core issue.

338
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:11,160
Quite simply put, when someone is a rich, famous, influential YouTuber, even if they are unpopular

339
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:15,640
or controversial, they still hold a level of power. I don't think that people, especially

340
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:20,200
the YouTube community, with its incredible diversity within reason, have a problem with

341
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:24,120
people casually hanging out with others of different ages if they have a similar level of

342
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:28,680
mobility. When I worked in retail in my teens, I would hang out with older individuals, and there

343
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:34,600
was no tension. The situation here is that people know the implications. When Sarah first left after

344
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:40,280
the set of controversies involving Billy, Onision made this video, basically blaming everyone else

345
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:43,080
while making some very interesting comments himself.

346
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:47,480
You could say we are kicking Sarah out, but I don't consider that the case. It's more like just

347
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:52,360
sending her home, and it's not exactly anyone's fault, unless like the internet were a person,

348
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:56,040
and then it might be the internet's fault, because really, if the internet wasn't weirdly involved

349
00:30:56,040 --> 00:31:00,120
with everything going on, then things would most likely be fine. Apparently Sarah also stated to

350
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:03,800
me that she remembered saying something about her one day being in a relationship with Lainey, and

351
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:07,960
that was super confusing to me as I had made it clear to the public, as you've seen in previous

352
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:11,560
videos, and I also made it clear repeatedly to Sarah that was never going to happen. So seeing

353
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:17,000
Sarah say these things really freaked me out. I mean, she's 16, I'm 31, this is creepy. And I know

354
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,960
a lot of people are going to ignore what I'm saying right now, so I'm going to say it again.

355
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:25,000
There was never a romantic relationship between Lainey and Sarah. Even her mom has told off the

356
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:30,680
internet regarding this issue. There's nothing weird. Lainey and Sarah are and have always been

357
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:35,800
just friends. I want you to keep these in mind. Over the next couple years, Sarah would visit,

358
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:40,760
and then leave and visit again. It was pretty suspicious, but at this time Onision was also

359
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:45,400
attracting plenty of drama elsewhere, particularly due to his outlandish statements on people like

360
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:50,360
Shane Dawson and Eugenia Cooney. It did honestly cross my mind if he was doing this as a method

361
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:55,240
of distraction. I do believe that Onision can be very calculated when needs require him to be,

362
00:31:55,240 --> 00:32:00,120
such as him hiding Kai from the public eye until he was nearly 18, because he knew he would be

363
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:04,920
scrutinized from both his audience and Kai's parents. I wouldn't put it past him being rather

364
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:09,480
shaken by the Billy situation, and wanting to distract from these statements, and thus making

365
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:14,440
videos on people he knew would stir up outrage and reaction, while steering them away from what

366
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:19,080
actually mattered. Now as always, when drama takes off, it has either the momentum to snowball,

367
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:24,680
or die down, and with the Sarah drama, for a bit, it died down, mainly because Sarah herself was

368
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:29,240
quite a reclusive person, and was clearly in a sensitive situation, but the uncertainty lingering

369
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:33,640
over Sarah's status probably meant an air of caution in people's approach. Nonetheless,

370
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:38,520
with what we know now, we can say with confidence that Mr Onion here wasn't acting completely in

371
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:43,240
good faith. On one hand, Sarah may have felt fortunate to have someone like Greg in her life,

372
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:47,800
who can offer her this home away from her own, which I have no reason to not believe wasn't

373
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:52,920
trouble to an extent. Why would she want to stir that up? She's still very young and vulnerable,

374
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:58,520
but that was the point. However, at the start of 2019, she had also defended Greg and Kai herself

375
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:03,480
fairly consistently over this time. For example, this clip from the start of 2019, in which she

376
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:09,720
argues in their favour. People are saying that we had sexual conversations, or were planning on

377
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:18,360
having sexual relations when I was underage, and we never did. I don't know why people are now

378
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:24,040
saying this, and bringing up old screenshots that have already been addressed, but Kai is one of the

379
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:29,640
sweetest people I know, and he doesn't deserve this, and it's not fair to me, and it's not fair

380
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:35,480
to him, and I wish this would all stop. Assumedly, this is what left many people rather quiet at the

381
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:40,440
time. However, something that both Greg and Sarah knew was that eventually Sarah would reach a stage

382
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:45,320
of mobility and sanity where she wouldn't necessarily be confined by the same chains,

383
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:49,960
and at a point she would have the option to break free. It was just a case of whether she'd let

384
00:33:49,960 --> 00:34:09,720
herself. Let's talk about it more. You remember the clip I told you to keep in mind?

385
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:13,320
Apparently Sarah also stated to me that she remembered saying something about her one day

386
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:17,400
being in a relationship with Laney, and that was super confusing to me as I had made it clear

387
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:21,320
to the public as you've seen in previous videos, and I also made it clear repeatedly to Sarah that

388
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:25,240
was never going to happen. So seeing Sarah say these things really freaked me out. I mean,

389
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:31,400
she's 16, I'm 31, this is creepy. Yes, that delightful one. It's a bad enough clip as it is,

390
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:36,200
but why on earth would you bring attention back then to these details when no one else was aware

391
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:40,680
of them? Well, in my opinion, it was because he knew he'd eventually be called back on these

392
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:45,000
details, and having already addressed them as confidently as he did, he could say, see,

393
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:50,440
I already spoke about this and no one challenged me on it. Not even Sarah. Onision always wanted

394
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:55,400
to be one step ahead of the drama. He wanted to set the record straight, be the voice of reason

395
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:59,800
and truth. So over the last 48 hours, some interesting things have gone down and I need

396
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:03,960
to talk about them because if I don't talk about them, then naturally with the online community,

397
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:08,280
rumors will run rampant and no one will have a video correcting those rumors with facts. So here

398
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:13,000
is that video. But the truth was going to reveal itself very soon because Onision, in spite of

399
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,560
suppressing these allegations, was holding back a river of sorts. And now we're going to talk

400
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:23,080
about why that dam was eventually busted. Earlier in the video, I spoke about the first four stages

401
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:28,440
of relationships with Onision. This is stage five, and I will now explain how it transpires in the

402
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:34,280
way it does. The first phenomenon is what I like to call the Bishop Brennan effect. Although there

403
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:38,840
is probably a more formal title, I quite like it because I think it's easier to explain. Bishop

404
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:43,480
Brennan was a character in the British comedy Father Ted, and in the third series, there is an

405
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:48,680
episode where Ted has to kick Bishop Brennan up the arse as a forfeit for cheating on a football

406
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:53,960
match. You really have to kick him up the arse, Ted. I lost the bet, Dougal. I have to do my

407
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:58,600
forfeit. Now Father Ted has no clue of how he's going to get away with it. Eventually, after some

408
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:03,400
scuffed attempts, he comes up with the bold idea that if he just acts as if he hasn't done anything

409
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:07,960
at all, then Bishop Brennan will be so shocked that he'll have no reason to question it. He

410
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:13,640
carries out this plan, and it works. So, off to see the Pope in Rome. I bet you're really looking

411
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:18,760
forward to that. Well, did you see anything? No, nothing there at all, sadly. You were right.

412
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:25,080
It was a wild goose chase. Where's Father Jessup? Maybe he went on ahead. Okay, so see you soon,

413
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:34,040
Your Grace. Come back as soon as you can. Bishop Brennan leaves in complete shock, but because the

414
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:38,600
shock and trauma of being kicked up the arse does not think to challenge Ted. This is the first

415
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:42,920
stage of the Bishop Brennan Effect, and something that can be observed in patterns with the people

416
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:47,720
today. A lot of people either out of shock, avoidance, trauma, and many other valid reasons

417
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:52,760
have avoided making a concerted effort to take Onision down. This does not mean there hasn't been

418
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:58,040
drama, but it means that the scattershot nature of it has led to Onision being pretty unaffected

419
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:02,680
at the core. Now, the second stage of the Bishop Brennan Effect is when Bishop Brennan has had the

420
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:07,400
time to think it over, and it hits him. He didn't kick me up the arse!

421
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:16,120
He goes back to confront Ted, who once again reasserts a different version of events.

422
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:21,320
Are you sure you're not making a terrible, terrible mistake? Do you think that could

423
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:25,720
be possible? Of course it's not! I mean, you know, it did occur to me that it was a bit, um,

424
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:31,080
a bit unbelievable, you know? It's unbelievable because it didn't actually happen.

425
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:36,680
This also confuses Bishop Brennan, to the point where he backs off again, and in fact he only

426
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:41,080
finds out when the evidence stares him right in the face. It's obviously exaggerated to a

427
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:45,560
comedic extent, and probably wouldn't pass in practicality, but I've always found it a good

428
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:50,760
example of how gaslighting can alter a person's own recollection of events. With Onision, his

429
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:55,480
constant documentation was almost a mechanism to try and explain things in the moment so they

430
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:59,960
wouldn't be pulled up against him later, and when people, particularly those he had subjected this

431
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:05,480
misery to, returned to these videos, they probably began to buy into Onision's explanations.

432
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:10,600
Equally, this is why, in many cases, many people turned away from the public eye themselves and

433
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:15,400
chose not to go for Onision because many felt they probably didn't have the influence to stop them.

434
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:20,280
He had control of the narrative. This concern they'd just be another victim of Greg's stream

435
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:25,240
of content was completely understandable because, to be frank, it had worked successfully enough in

436
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:31,320
the past, but Sarah was different. Sarah had her Bishop Brennan moment in mid-2019, and with the

437
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:35,960
help of other individuals, she moved in. As mentioned in the five stages of Onision

438
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:39,960
relationships, once Greg has given up trying to win you back, he'll go in the opposite direction

439
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:44,200
and relentlessly smear you. In some ways, this wasn't any different with Sarah, less than a month

440
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:49,160
after Sarah broke up with him on his Patreon, he uploaded a video called I Need To Talk About BPD,

441
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:53,320
where he frames anyone suffering from the disorder as suffering from memory issues and thus being

442
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:57,720
untrustworthy in their narratives. Now, at the time, Onision was under the impression that Sarah

443
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:02,600
had BPD. This was revealed to not be the case, so his point wouldn't have stood anyway, but the intent

444
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:07,080
remained the same. Although this was a clear attempt to keep his main donors on his side, he didn't

445
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:11,960
actually go public with this, like with many other females hoping to win her back. Maybe it was

446
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:16,040
because he was worried that the public would bring attention to him, maybe he felt like he had already

447
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:21,080
covered himself in the past, maybe he didn't think he had that much to gain from his public viewers,

448
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:25,640
maybe these were all valid reasons, and even though he was probably right in that regard,

449
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:30,600
he had a lot more to lose, because for the first time, he had left an open goal for Sarah to take

450
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:36,360
control of that public narrative, and when you have as many enemies as Onision, any error could

451
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:41,960
be fatal, and his handling of this particular one was just that. Onision knew that his comments would

452
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:46,840
provoke, maybe he was hoping that if he provoked her into stating these allegations in response to

453
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:52,040
his comments that he'd made about BPD, he would be able to publicly frame her as unhinged, and thus

454
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:57,720
proving his point. The idea of, look at this girl, I told you she was mentally unstable, and now she's

455
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:02,760
gone and proven it by accusing me of these heinous things that I would never do and she never said I'd

456
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:08,760
do either. It was Onision at his most manipulative, but it was also Onision at his most stupid,

457
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:14,200
because instead of allowing herself to be isolated in a sort of personal spat, she vowed to never be

458
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:19,720
silenced, and organised a response that would eventually start a domino effect of seismic proportions.

459
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:29,640
Onision had enemies, that much is true, it was like a list, and he just couldn't stop adding to it over

460
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:34,760
the years. Having such an expansive list of enemies will affect many people in different ways, I think

461
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:39,560
for Onision though, it made him complacent. For many, they will be afraid of making enemies,

462
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:44,680
particularly for the grudges that may be held, and how that may be used against people in the future.

463
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:49,800
I think at a point, Onision began to feel that no matter how many enemies he had, they didn't levy

464
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:54,680
any particular power over him, because the audience he held at close quarters were so unbelievably loyal,

465
00:40:54,680 --> 00:41:00,040
he could essentially get away with anything, but in August 2019, this was beginning to turn.

466
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:04,840
Let's reintroduce Ayala. We obviously know Ayala from the Billy situation, but she decided to be the

467
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:10,040
person to start the ball rolling on the new set of allegations, this time being the first to publicly

468
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:15,000
call Onision out for his behaviour with Sarah, tweeting that Onision had had sexual intercourse

469
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:19,640
with her. Now obviously, this could be considered inappropriate given it was probably Sarah's story

470
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:25,080
to tell, but Sarah quickly came forward corroborating Ayala's statement. This was then followed by statements

471
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:29,160
which implied they were working together, and that they were going to be delivering swift justice to

472
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:33,800
Onision. This was then followed by a stream in which Sarah talks in a lot of depth regarding her

473
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:38,360
relationship with Gregory, and as this followed through into the next few weeks, the Rolling Stone

474
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:42,760
finally gathered momentum. There were a lot of allegations, each holding their own weight,

475
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:47,320
regarding what both Onision and Kai did to Sarah while she was living with them. These claims

476
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:52,600
reflect what many people had cited as concerns when people originally took issue with Onision's

477
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:57,720
behaviour, but few had sought to push him further due to lack of information. Now, there was more

478
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:02,920
information, and the claims were just as bad as many have believed. In fact, everything that was claimed

479
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:07,480
there fits into the worldview that Onision had presented. For example, this screenshot which claimed

480
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:11,880
that Onision took pleasure in various sexual behaviour, that once again appears to fit in with that

481
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:17,160
cuckold fantasy clip we played earlier. It seems that Onision enjoys screwing around with relationships

482
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:22,040
and fantasies that involve rather deplorable behaviour. I won't be necessarily singling too many

483
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:26,920
examples out because at the end of the day, they all tell the story we expect it to. The quite simply

484
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:32,120
put, Onision was grooming younger individuals for sexual purposes, and he was using his relative

485
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:37,000
power to their powerlessness to tighten his grip and solicit what he wanted from them. I also wanted

486
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:41,800
to focus on this string of tweets that Sarah made on September 3rd. Now, on the one hand, this may

487
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:46,360
seem like someone making a variety of claims, in addition to what they'd already gone public with,

488
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:50,920
but to me this was the breaking of a wall that Onision has regularly used against people.

489
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:55,240
Remember what I said about Onision's smear campaign, with people like Billy for example, he would

490
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:59,480
regularly cite the fact that they conducted some behaviour that Onision deemed as morally

491
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:04,360
inadequate. It would not surprise me if while living with Onision, Sarah had been coerced into

492
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:09,480
doing actions or substances that Greg hoped to use against her in the future, either into shaming her

493
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:14,280
to keep silent, or in an attempt to discredit her when she spoke up. It's often hard to admit to

494
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:18,920
these sorts of behaviours for that exact fear, but the fact that Sarah unapologetically owned these

495
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:23,720
actions and even pushed the responsibility of these actions onto Onision didn't just give Onision

496
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:27,960
a lot less to defend himself with, but it also allowed Sarah to close the discussion on these

497
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:33,480
various elements and focus on the allegations, avoiding the traps that Onision probably laid

498
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:38,120
there for a reason. One of the biggest recurring themes that we have observed is how Onision appears

499
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:42,520
to ruin people's sense of self-worth, particularly illustrated by Billy's video.

500
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:46,840
Onision- I hope you're happy, you completely destroyed all of my pride.

501
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:50,520
What would serve as further evidence to this theory was the detail that Billy was shamed for

502
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:55,000
her association with marijuana when Onision decided to use it against her in his response

503
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,840
video. However, one of the things that Sarah alleges is that Onision actually tried to

504
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:03,720
convince her to bake weed brownies. Of course, this is just an allegation, but if true, it very

505
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:08,520
much fits into this idea that they were presenting. I personally believe the intent behind this was

506
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:13,240
exploitation, and using the fact that he exploited them as arguments for their weaknesses. On his old

507
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:18,040
site, one part that has regularly been referenced is how he blames victims who don't come forward.

508
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:22,440
That's not coincidence, he shames people for suffering, and he'll blame you for letting

509
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:27,640
yourself be exploited by him. Onision breaks you, and then convinces you that he's the one

510
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:32,120
to fix you, thus keeping you in this constant cycle. It's one thing to break the cycle,

511
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:36,440
it's another to actively be able to turn it on his head. But what about that video we showed

512
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:40,760
earlier, you know, the one where Sarah denied the allegations? Well, she apparently posted

513
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:43,400
a little blooper which sent a slightly different message.

514
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:55,000
On top of this, she also reveals texts in which Greg persuaded her to make the video,

515
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:00,200
and also suggests in another text that she sign a non-disclosure agreement. I must also add that

516
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:05,160
I really dislike the language he uses in these DMs. When he wants something, he never shows any

517
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:09,640
concern for how the other person feels. He never even seeks to reassure them when they show

518
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:13,880
demonstrable guilt, but he often seeks to reinforce that guilt by focusing on the feelings

519
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:18,280
that have provoked that guilt in the first place, thus mentally weakening them. He's already proven

520
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:22,920
his point in this conversation, and yet he's continuing to dance on this great. This theme of

521
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:27,800
making Sarah feel bad clearly worked for a while, in fact it worked for a significantly long time,

522
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:32,520
but these things seldom work forever, and it's just about what you decide to do when you realise

523
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:36,840
the lie. It's easy when you feel distanced from the situation to not want to return to the source

524
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:41,880
of that pain, and for so long the post-relationship conflict had burnt out, often because Onision

525
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:46,520
managed to make it look like some 50-50 squabble even when many hated him. When this happens,

526
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:51,000
you may lose hope in holding him to account, you may tell yourself that you're the only person

527
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:55,400
hurt by this, and if you just leave it, it'll be a part of history, and you can move on,

528
00:45:55,400 --> 00:46:01,320
but Onision wasn't stopping, and Sarah epitomised that continuation, so this time round his accusers

529
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:05,560
came out in force, with the testimonies piled up on top of each other, and it was not something

530
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:10,040
that Onision could fight easily. Let's talk about these allegations, what they tell us,

531
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:13,160
not just about Onision, but the people he targeted.

532
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:25,720
We've already partly talked about a fair few people in this story, particularly on how Onision

533
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:29,960
used them publicly, but there were even more details to be revealed, and details that paint

534
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:34,680
a picture are slightly more worrying. Some of these were based on mere allegations, but many

535
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:39,320
are also backed up with a lot of screenshots which seem verifiable, particularly regarding

536
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:44,360
Onision's communication with many of his accusers. Needless to say, it seems that Gregory has been

537
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:48,840
a busy bee. There's a lot of overlap, but I will be focusing on certain details which I find the

538
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:54,760
most illuminating. First to come forward was Skye, and her sister Netunesa. Skye was, as you should

539
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:59,720
know, Onision's first wife. Both these individuals' relationship with Greg preceded YouTube,

540
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:04,120
alongside some very assertive statements regarding Onision's sexual activity and behavior

541
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:09,240
towards her, the main recurring theme was that of the alimony. Now, Onision has made no secret in

542
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:14,760
the past that he was not a fan of paying alimony, even comparing it to slavery in one video.

543
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:20,920
Onision- Hey, do you support slavery? Like, do you support another person working for something that

544
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:28,120
they cannot profit from whatsoever? Do you support that? Okay, if your answer is no, then you don't

545
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:33,640
support alimony. And this was just one of the many statements he had made both in YouTube and tweet

546
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:38,920
form. Now, as mentioned in the first video, I don't believe Onision is poor, and if he is, it's definitely

547
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:44,040
a result of his own actions, so as part of the divorce settlement, paying Skye's alimony shouldn't

548
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:49,960
have been the most laborious task. However, to Onision, it was a terrible sacrifice, and his language

549
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:56,920
in these emails clearly demonstrate this. He started paying alimony in September of 2011, and by 2012,

550
00:47:56,920 --> 00:48:01,400
it had become too much of a task for him. Now, to many who followed it back then, he had already

551
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:07,480
alluded to suicide by alimony in a video around that time. Onision- The only thing it says is basically,

552
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:15,320
I have to be dead in order to stop making these payments. I have to be dead. Talk about incentive

553
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:20,440
of suicide. Well, if I kill myself, at least I don't have to pay my ex-wife anymore.

554
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:26,360
However, building on this, it seems he had sent multiple emails to Skye as well, including one

555
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:30,840
where he emailed her, stating that he planned on killing himself if she didn't halt the alimony

556
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:36,040
payments. This is a rather scummy tactic against something that he signed up to, but clearly thought

557
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:39,880
he could escape through other means. Besides these threats, one of the things that pervades

558
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:44,920
these emails is the tone of enslavement, he just wants to be free. Judging from the language he

559
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:49,640
uses, it's once again about the control, and he hates the fact that someone has power over him

560
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:54,360
in a way that he can't change. He uses multiple different tactics, including regret posting,

561
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:58,360
love bombing, even stating that he's spoken to his lawyer. We've already gone over these

562
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:03,240
tactics, but he switches from one to the other in an attempt to reach Skye's sympathies, fear, guilt,

563
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:08,920
anything that will make her give him what he wants. Fortunately, she was wise enough to identify them,

564
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:13,720
and in spite of a very painful relationship that she had encountered, and Onision's attempts to

565
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:19,880
reframe the situation in future blog posts, Skye had dealt him a hard L, and the emails show that.

566
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:25,320
Quickly following after came the testimony of Netunaza. Greg had known Netunaza from when she

567
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:29,560
was relatively young, in fact, in another tweet she claims he had tried to make out with her when

568
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:34,120
she was 15, which isn't a good look, however unfortunately there are no screenshots to

569
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:38,440
corroborate that. However, there are some additional ones which are quite entertaining.

570
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:43,080
In Netunaza's published screenshots, Onision asks how she's doing, and venting about the Shiloh

571
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:47,640
situation, a few months later he reaches out again as Shiloh returns to Canada for treatment.

572
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:53,080
This continues over 2012, including him offering her money to come on his tour, and even signing

573
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:57,640
her channel over to him, at one point saying that she'll make more money than she ever has before,

574
00:49:57,640 --> 00:50:02,680
despite being allegedly broke as he claimed in his alimony emails, he really knows how to pull out

575
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:08,600
the money when it matters. This continued well into 2013, and although on the surface it seems

576
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:13,080
like Greg was trying to pry another victim, she does seem like an exception to the rule in the

577
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:17,400
fact that she's not a fan, and she never showed explicit interest in the first place. It was a

578
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:23,160
pretty lost cause. Why was Greg doing this? Well, once again, maybe a matter of control, maybe even

579
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:27,800
attempt to elicit revenge on Sky. He hates that he's lost control, and thinks maybe he'll be able

580
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:32,920
to bring it back into his life by involving Sky's family, but in all honesty, it might just be one of

581
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:37,320
his fantasies to, you know, something about getting back together with someone's sister.

582
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:41,720
In another email, he does suggest this very strange scenario, which I can only assume

583
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:45,400
came from the pits of his mind, and even in a later video said this.

584
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:49,800
But if I didn't, if I wasn't to wind up with the spouse I have now, I would have actually wanted to

585
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:54,600
pursue the sister to date her, because we had so much more in common, and I would have had to wait

586
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:59,880
a few years because she was 15 and I was 18. At the time, she even tried to kiss me at one point,

587
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:05,320
I dodged it, because one, she was intoxicated, and two, again, our age gap, well, I'm not sure was

588
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:10,760
legal. I think it was legal, actually, but either way, I still dodged the kiss, so I wouldn't even risk

589
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:12,520
something illegal happening.

590
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:17,720
Oh well, there it is, Onision was the one with the self-control, it seems. Of course, he was just

591
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:23,400
waiting, that thing he said he'd never do, but oh well, tomatoes, tomatoes. Also, in this video,

592
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:28,360
he spoke about the time he searched out pictures of Netuneser from when she was modelling, lovely.

593
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:37,800
Because my ex-sister-in-law, uh, eventually became a S-U-I-C-I-D-E girl, okay, so that is a website

594
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:44,120
where girls take photos, or have someone take photos of them, and they get paid money for it.

595
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:52,120
It's artistic, it's typically girls with tattoos, so yeah, so she was exposed a little bit,

596
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:55,320
and everyone got to see the shape of her areolas.

597
00:51:55,320 --> 00:52:01,160
Oh, I'm sorry, I mean, everyone got to see them, and he just stumbled across them too.

598
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:07,240
Sky and Netuneser's stories show us what Onision would do when he feels like he's losing control.

599
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:12,200
On the other hand, Shiloh's story tells us what Onision does when he has control.

600
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:16,920
As we spoke earlier, judging by his content, he wanted people to be a part of his little spectacle.

601
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:20,840
We've spoken about a lot of this philosophy, but Shiloh's testimony does create a narrative

602
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:25,800
around the calculated nature of Onision, often checking legal restrictions, and behaving in a

603
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:30,840
way designed to deceive people who may have advised her otherwise, such as isolating Shiloh from her

604
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:36,040
parents, and keeping themselves to themselves. We already spoke about how Onision breaks people,

605
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:41,080
and Shiloh once again pays testimony to that, going into details that you can read here.

606
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:44,120
One re-upload is this very chilling clip.

607
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:49,800
Shiloh- So, he took the scissors to my ear in my sleep, and now I'm bleeding.

608
00:52:49,800 --> 00:53:00,120
But, I mean, it's a great look, it's gonna scare all the kids, you know?

609
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:02,120
It hurts a lot, actually.

610
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:05,400
Shiloh- I know this video is never going to be online, right?

611
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:08,280
No one will ever know how much I abuse you.

612
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:12,600
It's ridiculous that you think you'll be successful.

613
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:18,600
How many times do I have to tell you, everything that you want to put online goes through me first?

614
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:23,960
Now, I don't know what the exact explanation is for this, I assume it was uploaded at some point

615
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:28,440
as some intent of a joke, but there's something very personally discomforting about it for me,

616
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:33,000
and a lot of other people. It says more than any testimony really can.

617
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:37,400
One of the more interesting outcomes of this situation was Shiloh's crowdfunding campaign

618
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:41,400
to remove a tattoo with Gregory imprinted on the back of her neck, which although it may have

619
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:45,960
seemed romantic at the time, now in reflection, seems like a painful reminder of a damaging

620
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:50,440
relationship. For someone who once decried the use of tattoos, Greg very quickly changed his mind on

621
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:54,680
them, maybe due to their permanence, or the commitment that they implied. As mentioned earlier,

622
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:58,840
it seems that Greg likes to make people feel attached to him, however, she recently had a new

623
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:02,280
tattoo placed over the old one, and I hope through that she does feel liberated.

624
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:07,320
I don't really wanna just read out the statements, but as always, there will be a reference sheet in

625
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:12,360
the pinned comment. What it does is, it confirms the timeline that we could see in Onision's

626
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:16,840
content, how he often manipulated the environment, and how this had an often effect on someone like

627
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:21,480
Shiloh. However, it not just frames Onision as exploiting our troubles, it paints him as

628
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:26,360
instigating them too. To say it again, Onision breaks you, and then tells you that he's the

629
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:31,400
one to fix you. Shiloh's testimony was anecdotal, but I do believe her, that's a personal opinion,

630
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:36,920
but I think it's a well backed one. However, Fred wasn't the only character in this story, Shiloh,

631
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:42,040
Sky, and Netunasa all tend to predate this next individual, but with Billy and Sarah's stories,

632
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:45,000
we can't go letting them off scot-free, can we?

633
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:52,200
If you think anything ill of Kai, you are retarded. He is one of the most amazing people

634
00:54:52,200 --> 00:55:00,200
on planet fucking Earth. If anyone gives anyone shit about anything in this relationship between

635
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:06,440
Kai and I, it should be me. Kai is a fucking angel. And you know, you could ask pretty much,

636
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:12,840
uh, fuck, I don't even want to talk about it.

637
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:30,200
Kai, known as Laney pre-transition, is Onision's current husband, and someone who Onision would

638
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:34,920
probably regard as his successful project. I already said how the star-crossed lovers met

639
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:39,000
through the rinse and repeat of Onision's twitter replies, now it's hard to say exactly what has

640
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:43,720
happened behind the scenes, but Onision cemented that loyalty in many ways over the years.

641
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:48,200
Throughout the various people entering and leaving their lives, Kai is the one who has remained

642
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:53,000
consistently by Onision's side. He's made a few statements himself, but mostly keeps off the

643
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:58,120
internet. Nonetheless, with the swarm of new allegations and details, it seems that he was

644
00:55:58,120 --> 00:56:03,960
not just another victim. September the 14th of 2019 brought us Billy's testimony, and others

645
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:08,040
were not too far behind either. Billy stated that she was brought into the household under

646
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:12,200
the precipice of getting to know Kai. In fact, these DMs show Kai fully stating that Onision

647
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:15,960
would not be involved. However, this was soon contradicted by a conversation at the dinner

648
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:20,520
table where Greg proposed the idea of a three-way relationship. Billy also showed DMs of Greg

649
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:24,680
pressuring her to ask Kai out, once again paying credibility to the idea that this was one of

650
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:29,560
Greg's pursuits as well. In another statement, she talks about the cheating situation where Greg

651
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:33,720
states he's gonna do whatever he wants, and although Kai told Billy to not let it happen,

652
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:38,520
Kai then said to Greg that he can do whatever he wants. It basically set up the situation which

653
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:42,840
allowed them to blame Billy for the cheating that we spoke about earlier, and the subsequent

654
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:47,640
contract which was such a great idea. Kai's position appears in this as someone who may be

655
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:52,520
enabling Greg's behaviour, and not standing up for those around him, but also someone who may be

656
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:56,760
equally as afraid of Greg. One of the things that you can identify is that Greg often likes to

657
00:56:56,760 --> 00:57:01,320
weaponise Kai and speak on behalf of him, regularly telling people how Kai feels in an

658
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:06,360
attempt to guilt trip individuals while seeming like a selfless husband, such as these emails

659
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:14,200
where he says that Kai's crying, and that's why you should care. Ah, my heart weeps. Kai is used

660
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:19,160
as a human shield for Greg's interests, a way to try and pull people back into his life, such as

661
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:23,960
these emails where he basically tells Billy that even if you hate him, you could at least come back

662
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:29,720
for Kai. What about Kai, guys? Kai also sent some emails to Billy, but as Billy noted, they

663
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:34,680
resembled Greg's language a lot, and seemed like another manipulation tactic. Many have noted Kai's

664
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:40,280
tendency to not just excuse Greg's behaviour, but even defend it. In a way, Onision has found his

665
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:45,400
perfect cult member. However, many also said they saw what Greg does to Kai, and if it's anything

666
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:49,400
like the other testimonies, then I'm more than willing to believe there may be a great deal of

667
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:55,400
turmoil involved. So far we know that Kai probably acts as a pawn, as a shield, and as an enabler,

668
00:57:55,400 --> 00:58:00,920
but they're also all things that can be completely true of a victim, and people suffering from severe

669
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:05,640
mental entrapment. If it stopped here, then we might be able to draw some sort of line that Kai

670
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:10,840
just needs to break out of the mental clutches of Onision, and to an extent, he may still need to.

671
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:16,120
However, nonetheless, what will be spoken about next cannot easily be excused by even Gregory

672
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:21,800
Onion Man's manipulation. Often the most loyal cult members will be on a job to get new recruits,

673
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:27,720
and even mimic the behaviour of their leader. And well, if Onision had grooming problems, then

674
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:33,080
Kai wasn't too far behind. The first story comes from someone by the name of Regina, who wasn't

675
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:37,560
heavily involved in Greg's life, but was one of the first people who Kai started talking to.

676
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:42,440
Now this was before Kai was openly bisexual, and given his relatively small internet following,

677
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:48,040
a lot of people probably overlooked this. Regina had been watching since 2009, and they began DMing

678
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:54,200
in around 2012. There was a two year age gap here, with Regina being 15, and Kai being 17.

679
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:58,200
On the surface, you may be able to give that a pass. When you consider it in the context of the

680
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:03,640
next person, Sarah, and the greater plan that some people clearly had, then it does become worrying.

681
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:07,800
I would also add that some of the tweets would certainly raise a few eyebrows to say the least,

682
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:13,640
and Regina testifies that Kai had appeared topless in a Skype call, which is not good.

683
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:18,600
Regina was invited to Kai and Greg's wedding at one point, but their mother declined on behalf of them.

684
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:27,640
The first time I remember vividly was to come to visit for their wedding. I was young and I was very

685
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:35,800
into photography at the time. That was a really big aspiration of mine, and I would always show Kai

686
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:42,600
my pictures I took, and Kai said, would you want to take pictures for our wedding? Luckily, my mother

687
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:48,920
would not allow that to happen, and I never got a proper date on when the wedding would have been,

688
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:54,920
so they carried on without me. Probably for the better. There were also a lot of DMs released,

689
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:59,000
which, although may be typical in some relationships, this wasn't a relationship,

690
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:03,080
and with the context that this is more of a game to Kai than anything else, playing with these

691
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:07,640
younger person's feelings is pretty sickening. This has been alleged to have been repeated with

692
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:11,960
other people as well, even people not particularly well known to their channel, which is a tad

693
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:17,080
concerning considering how far this actually extends. However, if we do want someone a bit

694
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:22,200
more well known, we'll talk about Sarah. Obviously, as the person who set off this chain reaction,

695
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:26,600
it's appropriate that we end this where we started. Sarah, like Regina, like Billy,

696
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:32,760
met Kai first, back when Sarah was only 14, and Kai was 18. Now that's a gap that is slightly

697
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:37,960
more concerning, especially if there were implications, which there were. At this stage,

698
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:42,760
there was also a rather strange three-way dynamic. In this instance, I'll just let the tweets do the

699
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:47,640
talking because there isn't really too much subtext. However, as the years passed, Regina was

700
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:53,080
gradually pushed away. Despite wanting to remain in contact, it appears that Onision and Kai had set

701
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:59,000
their sights on both Billy and Sarah, with Kai crudely cutting Regina off in 2016, only bothering

702
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:04,600
to justify this in 2017, around the time of the controversy with Billy, I wonder why.

703
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:11,240
Reading the DMs is kinda sad to be honest, seeing Kai disregard the investment that Regina had,

704
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:17,240
that Kai cultivated, clearly discontinued for no discernible reason. Make no mistake,

705
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:22,040
it was for the best, but it shows you how much of a project this was, how they were willing to

706
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:27,720
discard people who they didn't feel fit in with their greater plan. It cemented what was ultimately

707
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:33,160
most insidious about this whole relationship, the fact that to me, Kai was being mobilised by Greg,

708
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:37,960
and maybe even to a degree of his own volition, to rope these people into their household,

709
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:43,400
and involve themselves with Greg in some additional twisted sexual way. We saw this with

710
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:48,280
Onision's own content with Billy, and we see it in the testimonies of people who would experience

711
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:54,040
both these unpleasant characters. In 2018, while still underage herself, Sarah states that Kai

712
01:01:54,040 --> 01:02:00,280
sent her nudes, and although she was 17, so a bit older, Kai was 23. Truth and context prevailing,

713
01:02:00,280 --> 01:02:05,400
these details leave a nasty taste in your mouth, and go firmly against this theory that Onision

714
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:10,600
and Kai considered her merely as a friend while she was a minor, alongside all the other evidence,

715
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:15,720
including this very romantic picture on girlfriend's day, and of course, these hilarious old tweets

716
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:21,720
about grooming individuals. Such great banter. Kai did make live streams defending himself at the

717
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:26,920
time, but with a clearer documentation of the evidence, those defences haven't aged very well at all.

718
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:49,080
To add to this, additional people came forward stating that they had similar experiences,

719
01:02:49,080 --> 01:02:53,240
while those individuals called Hayley showed additional DMs in which Greg attempted to pressure

720
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:58,600
into a relationship with Kai. He once again talks on behalf of Kai, and is very coercive in his language.

721
01:02:58,600 --> 01:03:04,280
It's the same story, Hayley started talking to Kai, and not too long after our friend Gregory moves in.

722
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:08,680
In this instance, Hayley declines, and notes that she feels like she's being used as a distraction,

723
01:03:08,680 --> 01:03:13,880
which she probably is to an extent, but looking at the pattern, what it represents is much greater.

724
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:18,280
To many of Greg's accusers, Kai was the gateway drug to Onision's worst behaviour.

725
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:22,600
He has regularly roped in others under the precipice of something more casual and friendly,

726
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:27,480
maybe a nice little romantic thing between two people, but it hasn't been long before other forces

727
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:32,120
have come into play. When I first started reading the testimonies, I was open to consider that maybe

728
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:36,760
Kai was just a person under Greg's influence, given how much control he likes to wager,

729
01:03:36,760 --> 01:03:40,920
but I don't believe that Kai is without his investments, and the amount of emotional upset

730
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:45,800
that this has caused does not give many people reason to exhume Kai of his own responsibility.

731
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:49,800
In the recent months, Kai has spent a large proportion of his time off social media,

732
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:53,560
and we might get a bit more into that in the future, but whether he's here or not,

733
01:03:53,560 --> 01:03:58,040
the consequences of his actions remain the same. Let's wrap this part up then.

734
01:03:58,040 --> 01:04:15,800
I want to emphasize that this is not every last detail. There are many more people with many more

735
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:21,560
claims, and the fact that I've chosen to cover the ones I have today does not necessarily discount

736
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:26,360
any others, but I think the stories we've covered today tell us what we need to know about Onision

737
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:31,640
and his behavior. In the first part we covered how Onision cultivates a cult status, in this part

738
01:04:31,640 --> 01:04:36,520
we've spoken about how many have been entangled in this web, and how it has subsequently affected

739
01:04:36,520 --> 01:04:41,880
them personally. Greg's outward demeanor expressed in a few select videos may have captured people's

740
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:47,720
attention, his openness and accessibility may have made people feel endeared, they may have reached

741
01:04:47,720 --> 01:04:52,920
out to him in the hope of filling a hole created by their own vulnerabilities, but Greg wasn't

742
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:58,200
interested in that. He was interested in finding and pinpointing the weakness, exploiting it, and

743
01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:02,680
making people attached to him so that he could use it for his own gain. There were many various

744
01:05:02,680 --> 01:05:07,960
psychological tactics he would employ to make sure that this was facilitated. In a way, he's a bit like

745
01:05:07,960 --> 01:05:12,680
Pennywise, depending on a person's proximity, their behavior, and the way they reacted to him,

746
01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:17,560
he would manifest into various forms of himself, often with mind to which one would be the most

747
01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:22,280
successful, and when he was faced down with defeat from individuals like Sky, he would malfunction and

748
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:27,160
try becoming everything at once, but unfortunately, many people did fall for the versions of himself

749
01:05:27,160 --> 01:05:32,440
that he presented multiple times, and went back, often to more suffering. He would typically use his

750
01:05:32,440 --> 01:05:37,080
channel to portray a narrative that he was this person, trying to help others out when they were

751
01:05:37,080 --> 01:05:42,520
merely struggling, and he ended up on the wrong end of things, but behind the scenes, he was the

752
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:48,200
instigator of that exact conflict. This content would be used to deceive his fans, and even his

753
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:52,920
partners, into probably believing that they may share some blame, and it only took distance

754
01:05:52,920 --> 01:05:57,960
and sobriety to realize the influence that he controlled over them. In the meantime, Onision

755
01:05:57,960 --> 01:06:02,120
would often use his platform to control the narrative over them, when he had exhausted all

756
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:06,600
his methods of entrapment, he'll switch his narrative over how awful these people actually

757
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:12,120
were for him, often showing himself as blameless, but also vulnerable, maybe in a way to encourage

758
01:06:12,120 --> 01:06:17,400
other people to reach out. This didn't work for a while until the person named Kai, I'm not sure if

759
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:21,800
Greg did anything exceptionally differently. He started the relationship by showing his commitment,

760
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:26,040
kept it down to the critical public art as long as possible, and moved in to cement the loyalty

761
01:06:26,040 --> 01:06:31,080
as soon as possible. Kai was just the first person to be completely complicit, it seems. He stood by

762
01:06:31,080 --> 01:06:35,960
Greg under a large majority of criticisms, under a large majority of circumstances, and eventually

763
01:06:35,960 --> 01:06:41,000
became Player 2 in the Onision game, continuing to pull in new victims who would be subjected to

764
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:45,080
more of Greg's mental formula. When they pulled away, they'd be regularly subjected to Greg's

765
01:06:45,080 --> 01:06:49,800
deluge of public and private rants which were designed to swear pinion in his favour,

766
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:54,920
a position that he could now take comfortably with a spouse already by his side. Overall, this

767
01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:59,240
formula was predominantly successful for the approval of those that Onision concerned himself

768
01:06:59,240 --> 01:07:03,800
with, and even when it failed, it would typically not amount to anything more. However, in recent

769
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:08,840
months, with the universal sentiment against Greg mounting, and his hesitancy and subsequent failure

770
01:07:08,840 --> 01:07:13,480
to actually attempt to control what was being said, combined with some old enemies returning,

771
01:07:13,480 --> 01:07:17,880
the allegations against him finally organised themselves in a comprehensive fashion where the

772
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:22,520
discussion changed from who was in the right, to what punishment is suitable for this behaviour.

773
01:07:22,520 --> 01:07:27,080
Greg's position of being accused of various heinous behaviours before, in many ways, shouldn't

774
01:07:27,080 --> 01:07:31,800
be the most unfamiliar territory for him, but this time it's been coordinated in a way that makes the

775
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:36,600
claims insurmountable, and whereas there was a level of grey in the past, many have felt that

776
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:42,200
today's evidence has proven beyond any doubt that Onision's behaviour as a creator, and as a person

777
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:47,560
has been unequivocally deplorable. Fortunately, in September of 2019, and the following months,

778
01:07:47,560 --> 01:07:51,880
many people came forward to illuminate his treatment of them, and others around them. Videos

779
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:57,400
began to gain more traction, and more commentators jumped on the topic, thus providing more publicity.

780
01:07:57,400 --> 01:08:01,640
With the walls closing in, and more spotlights coming onto him, not just from the YouTube sphere,

781
01:08:01,640 --> 01:08:07,080
he began to capitulate in ways unseen, yet many still feel that there is unfinished business given

782
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:13,080
his actions. Join me for the final part of this painful saga, as I go into the fall of Onision,

783
01:08:13,080 --> 01:08:18,440
his responses, and how they've evolved in the last year. However, it won't be just that, so I also plan

784
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:23,640
to delve into, and deconstruct his broken philosophy, and make the argument for why his place on this

785
01:08:23,640 --> 01:08:25,880
platform should be seriously reconsidered.

786
01:08:28,840 --> 01:08:34,920
So yes, that was the video, that was a great fun video, I wanna give a big shout out to the editors,

787
01:08:34,920 --> 01:08:39,880
because if they've had to experience this as much as I have, then they'll probably be reeling too,

788
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:45,080
and they deserve credit for their commitment. Heaven knows we need it sometimes. I also wanna give

789
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:51,880
big thanks to my Patreons, my $10 patreons are on screen right now, they do a fantastic job.

790
01:08:51,880 --> 01:08:58,120
I also need to give big thanks to my $50 patreons, some hullabaloo Nico Deschamps and Caroline,

791
01:08:58,120 --> 01:09:03,960
with a very special thanks to my $100 patreons Brandon and Stanton. Thank you guys for your

792
01:09:03,960 --> 01:09:10,280
support, it is deeply appreciated, especially in times like these. If you wanna reach me,

793
01:09:10,280 --> 01:09:15,480
reach me on Twitter, at TheRightOpinion, reach me on Facebook, TheRightOpinionOfficial,

794
01:09:15,480 --> 01:09:22,280
reach me on Discord, link in the pinned comments, and even Instagram though, I'm obviously,

795
01:09:22,280 --> 01:09:27,720
my life isn't exciting enough for that a lot of the time, but I have fun at least. Don't really have

796
01:09:27,720 --> 01:09:32,120
too much else to add, I wanna thank everyone for the support of recent, and this will probably be

797
01:09:32,120 --> 01:09:37,000
the first video after Christmas, though my first video of this will probably be out on Christmas

798
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:42,360
day, so I just wanna say that I hope everyone's had a good year, and let's hope for better things

799
01:09:43,080 --> 01:09:46,600
in 2020. Other than that, I don't really have too much else to say,

800
01:09:47,240 --> 01:09:50,200
and I'm TheRightOpinion, I'll see you in the next one.

801
01:10:02,120 --> 01:10:10,360
Bye!
