0	5000	If you haven't seen the latest Captain America yet, you should.
5000	6000	It's fucking awesome.
11000	15000	Hello and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time.
15000	18000	Today we talk about Captain America.
18000	21000	Now, before I start, I will be shortly outlining the plot.
21000	24000	Though I won't consider them spoilers, just a warning.
24000	27000	For those who don't know the synopsis in Captain America Civil War,
27000	31000	the US government wishes to impose a contract on the Avengers to put them under UN control,
31000	37000	so all their actions that they conduct will be done at the UN's approval to prevent unnecessary loss of life.
37000	42000	Some of those at SHIELD endorse the contract, and some of them oppose it, causing some divisions to form.
42000	46000	It was a really great plotline and one that really showed the personality of a lot of characters,
46000	49000	which made me a lot more involved in the story.
49000	53000	I left Captain America Civil War wholly satisfied and yet contemplative,
53000	57000	contemplating of whether that contract that is supposedly imposed on these characters
57000	61000	is in the best interest of the national and international government.
61000	65000	I think I ended up signing more with Captain America for one very decisive reason.
65000	70000	The UN is a very prestigious organisation with a lot of weight and importance in their decisions.
70000	76000	They are made up of nearly every sovereign state in the world, so they do hold a lot of international influence.
76000	81000	The issue is, when you are made up of so many member states with various different vested interests
81000	83000	that it's often hard to come to an agreement.
83000	87000	And I know I'm talking hypothetically right now because these are fucking superheroes,
87000	93000	and to my disappointment they don't actually exist outside the realms of comic books, but, you know, it's interesting.
93000	96000	If the UN was this all-resolving, all-intelligent power,
96000	101000	then I'd probably agree with the sentiment of signing this contract to grant the UN powers over them.
101000	105000	But passing over the powers to the UN would just further distill any accountability.
105000	110000	The fact that they're independent allows them to make these hard decisions that many countries would not be able to make,
110000	113000	and a majority of the time it will be for the greater good.
113000	118000	The Avengers are a fictional representation of what could be called Democracy Manifest.
118000	122000	This is Democracy Manifest.
122000	126000	In many ways they operate outside the law, and I can see arguments against this.
126000	130000	They, like regular people, should be held accountable for their actions,
130000	136000	and if they are acting under UN authority, then at least the public can trust their actions are being done at the approval of various governments.
136000	140000	But then there's the question of the difference between the government's interests and the people's interests.
140000	146000	In my opinion, they'd just carry on being airdropped to the Middle East if they handed over the control panel to the UN.
146000	149000	I mean, hell, look at Captain America The Winter Soldier.
149000	152000	If the government's will had been put above, then Iger would be in charge.
152000	158000	There will undoubtedly be damage, but in many circumstances that damage will be to protect the rest of the world.
158000	163000	Of course, the argument then is that what if there was a less destructive way to deal with the problems?
163000	166000	However, then you risk taking too long to come to a conclusion.
166000	172000	If you let the danger fester until you realise what it really is capable of, then often you're too late.
172000	177000	I referenced Captain America The Winter Soldier earlier, and I will reference it again.
177000	180000	Yes, there was massive damage on bringing down HYDRA,
180000	186000	but none compared to that that would have been done if they'd allowed HYDRA to operate, even for a moment.
186000	190000	It's called collateral damage, and in many circumstances this is necessary.
190000	196000	Yes, there will be mistakes, yes, there will be errors, but that doesn't mean that the UN won't make mistakes as well.
196000	202000	The contract, in my opinion, just provides a shift of blame and false responsibility that wouldn't actually make the world a safer place.
202000	205000	I think the main issue is whether you trust authority.
205000	208000	And like Captain America, I don't.
208000	212000	But to concede, I'm not a very trusting person.
212000	216000	Anyway, that was something a bit more buried, but I do like to mix up.
216000	219000	Who do you side with? Why do you side with them? Let me know.
219000	223000	And if you're new and you like to live dangerously, like I do,
223000	228000	then a like and subscription would really improve your reputation in that area.
228000	230000	Especially if you hate me.
231000	233000	Anti-psychology, innit?
234000	237000	Anyway, I'm The Right Opinion, and I'll see you on the next one.
249000	251000	Thank you for watching.
