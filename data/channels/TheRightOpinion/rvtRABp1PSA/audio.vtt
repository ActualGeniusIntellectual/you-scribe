00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
If you haven't seen the latest Captain America yet, you should.

00:05.000 --> 00:06.000
It's fucking awesome.

00:11.000 --> 00:15.000
Hello and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time.

00:15.000 --> 00:18.000
Today we talk about Captain America.

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
Now, before I start, I will be shortly outlining the plot.

00:21.000 --> 00:24.000
Though I won't consider them spoilers, just a warning.

00:24.000 --> 00:27.000
For those who don't know the synopsis in Captain America Civil War,

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
the US government wishes to impose a contract on the Avengers to put them under UN control,

00:31.000 --> 00:37.000
so all their actions that they conduct will be done at the UN's approval to prevent unnecessary loss of life.

00:37.000 --> 00:42.000
Some of those at SHIELD endorse the contract, and some of them oppose it, causing some divisions to form.

00:42.000 --> 00:46.000
It was a really great plotline and one that really showed the personality of a lot of characters,

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
which made me a lot more involved in the story.

00:49.000 --> 00:53.000
I left Captain America Civil War wholly satisfied and yet contemplative,

00:53.000 --> 00:57.000
contemplating of whether that contract that is supposedly imposed on these characters

00:57.000 --> 01:01.000
is in the best interest of the national and international government.

01:01.000 --> 01:05.000
I think I ended up signing more with Captain America for one very decisive reason.

01:05.000 --> 01:10.000
The UN is a very prestigious organisation with a lot of weight and importance in their decisions.

01:10.000 --> 01:16.000
They are made up of nearly every sovereign state in the world, so they do hold a lot of international influence.

01:16.000 --> 01:21.000
The issue is, when you are made up of so many member states with various different vested interests

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
that it's often hard to come to an agreement.

01:23.000 --> 01:27.000
And I know I'm talking hypothetically right now because these are fucking superheroes,

01:27.000 --> 01:33.000
and to my disappointment they don't actually exist outside the realms of comic books, but, you know, it's interesting.

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
If the UN was this all-resolving, all-intelligent power,

01:36.000 --> 01:41.000
then I'd probably agree with the sentiment of signing this contract to grant the UN powers over them.

01:41.000 --> 01:45.000
But passing over the powers to the UN would just further distill any accountability.

01:45.000 --> 01:50.000
The fact that they're independent allows them to make these hard decisions that many countries would not be able to make,

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
and a majority of the time it will be for the greater good.

01:53.000 --> 01:58.000
The Avengers are a fictional representation of what could be called Democracy Manifest.

01:58.000 --> 02:02.000
This is Democracy Manifest.

02:02.000 --> 02:06.000
In many ways they operate outside the law, and I can see arguments against this.

02:06.000 --> 02:10.000
They, like regular people, should be held accountable for their actions,

02:10.000 --> 02:16.000
and if they are acting under UN authority, then at least the public can trust their actions are being done at the approval of various governments.

02:16.000 --> 02:20.000
But then there's the question of the difference between the government's interests and the people's interests.

02:20.000 --> 02:26.000
In my opinion, they'd just carry on being airdropped to the Middle East if they handed over the control panel to the UN.

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
I mean, hell, look at Captain America The Winter Soldier.

02:29.000 --> 02:32.000
If the government's will had been put above, then Iger would be in charge.

02:32.000 --> 02:38.000
There will undoubtedly be damage, but in many circumstances that damage will be to protect the rest of the world.

02:38.000 --> 02:43.000
Of course, the argument then is that what if there was a less destructive way to deal with the problems?

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
However, then you risk taking too long to come to a conclusion.

02:46.000 --> 02:52.000
If you let the danger fester until you realise what it really is capable of, then often you're too late.

02:52.000 --> 02:57.000
I referenced Captain America The Winter Soldier earlier, and I will reference it again.

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
Yes, there was massive damage on bringing down HYDRA,

03:00.000 --> 03:06.000
but none compared to that that would have been done if they'd allowed HYDRA to operate, even for a moment.

03:06.000 --> 03:10.000
It's called collateral damage, and in many circumstances this is necessary.

03:10.000 --> 03:16.000
Yes, there will be mistakes, yes, there will be errors, but that doesn't mean that the UN won't make mistakes as well.

03:16.000 --> 03:22.000
The contract, in my opinion, just provides a shift of blame and false responsibility that wouldn't actually make the world a safer place.

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
I think the main issue is whether you trust authority.

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
And like Captain America, I don't.

03:28.000 --> 03:32.000
But to concede, I'm not a very trusting person.

03:32.000 --> 03:36.000
Anyway, that was something a bit more buried, but I do like to mix up.

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
Who do you side with? Why do you side with them? Let me know.

03:39.000 --> 03:43.000
And if you're new and you like to live dangerously, like I do,

03:43.000 --> 03:48.000
then a like and subscription would really improve your reputation in that area.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
Especially if you hate me.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
Anti-psychology, innit?

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
Anyway, I'm The Right Opinion, and I'll see you on the next one.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
Thank you for watching.
