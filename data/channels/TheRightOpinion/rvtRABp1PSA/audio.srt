00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
If you haven't seen the latest Captain America yet, you should.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
It's fucking awesome.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Hello and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Today we talk about Captain America.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Now, before I start, I will be shortly outlining the plot.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Though I won't consider them spoilers, just a warning.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
For those who don't know the synopsis in Captain America Civil War,

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
the US government wishes to impose a contract on the Avengers to put them under UN control,

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
so all their actions that they conduct will be done at the UN's approval to prevent unnecessary loss of life.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Some of those at SHIELD endorse the contract, and some of them oppose it, causing some divisions to form.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
It was a really great plotline and one that really showed the personality of a lot of characters,

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
which made me a lot more involved in the story.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I left Captain America Civil War wholly satisfied and yet contemplative,

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
contemplating of whether that contract that is supposedly imposed on these characters

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
is in the best interest of the national and international government.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I think I ended up signing more with Captain America for one very decisive reason.

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The UN is a very prestigious organisation with a lot of weight and importance in their decisions.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
They are made up of nearly every sovereign state in the world, so they do hold a lot of international influence.

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
The issue is, when you are made up of so many member states with various different vested interests

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
that it's often hard to come to an agreement.

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
And I know I'm talking hypothetically right now because these are fucking superheroes,

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
and to my disappointment they don't actually exist outside the realms of comic books, but, you know, it's interesting.

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
If the UN was this all-resolving, all-intelligent power,

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
then I'd probably agree with the sentiment of signing this contract to grant the UN powers over them.

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
But passing over the powers to the UN would just further distill any accountability.

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
The fact that they're independent allows them to make these hard decisions that many countries would not be able to make,

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
and a majority of the time it will be for the greater good.

28
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
The Avengers are a fictional representation of what could be called Democracy Manifest.

29
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
This is Democracy Manifest.

30
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
In many ways they operate outside the law, and I can see arguments against this.

31
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
They, like regular people, should be held accountable for their actions,

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
and if they are acting under UN authority, then at least the public can trust their actions are being done at the approval of various governments.

33
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
But then there's the question of the difference between the government's interests and the people's interests.

34
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
In my opinion, they'd just carry on being airdropped to the Middle East if they handed over the control panel to the UN.

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I mean, hell, look at Captain America The Winter Soldier.

36
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
If the government's will had been put above, then Iger would be in charge.

37
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,000
There will undoubtedly be damage, but in many circumstances that damage will be to protect the rest of the world.

38
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Of course, the argument then is that what if there was a less destructive way to deal with the problems?

39
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
However, then you risk taking too long to come to a conclusion.

40
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,000
If you let the danger fester until you realise what it really is capable of, then often you're too late.

41
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I referenced Captain America The Winter Soldier earlier, and I will reference it again.

42
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Yes, there was massive damage on bringing down HYDRA,

43
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
but none compared to that that would have been done if they'd allowed HYDRA to operate, even for a moment.

44
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
It's called collateral damage, and in many circumstances this is necessary.

45
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Yes, there will be mistakes, yes, there will be errors, but that doesn't mean that the UN won't make mistakes as well.

46
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,000
The contract, in my opinion, just provides a shift of blame and false responsibility that wouldn't actually make the world a safer place.

47
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I think the main issue is whether you trust authority.

48
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
And like Captain America, I don't.

49
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
But to concede, I'm not a very trusting person.

50
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Anyway, that was something a bit more buried, but I do like to mix up.

51
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Who do you side with? Why do you side with them? Let me know.

52
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
And if you're new and you like to live dangerously, like I do,

53
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
then a like and subscription would really improve your reputation in that area.

54
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Especially if you hate me.

55
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Anti-psychology, innit?

56
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Anyway, I'm The Right Opinion, and I'll see you on the next one.

57
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Thank you for watching.
