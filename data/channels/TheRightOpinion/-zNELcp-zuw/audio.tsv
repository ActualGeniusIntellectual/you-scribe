0	1000	Grade A under A.
1000	2000	Grade A under A.
2000	3000	Grade A under A.
3000	4000	Grade A under A.
4000	5000	Grade A under A.
5000	6000	Grade A under A.
6000	9800	So a lot of newcomers to the website who may stumble across Grade's channel, Grade A under
9800	13000	A, may not even realize why Grade was so important in the first place.
30000	36200	Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with
36200	39760	too much free time, and today we talk about someone who I've had a lot of requests to
39760	44500	cover but never really quite got around to, well, today, my friends, is the time I finally
44500	45500	address it.
45500	49560	Now, in keeping with the old routine, we'll begin this video with a nice little story,
49560	51900	because I love a good story like anyone else.
51900	55600	When I was growing up, I wasn't really the type of person who used Twitter, or any of
55600	57560	the social media sites that I use today.
57560	61400	I was at school, and back then the only app that was really considered fashionable was
61400	62400	Facebook.
62400	66580	Now this is before Facebook was taken over by mums and their minion memes, but just take
66580	71080	my word, at some point Facebook was cool, I promise guys, please don't reject me.
71080	74920	At the time, it was cool to follow ridiculous numbers of Facebook pages, and before they
74920	79360	were taken over by cash farm sponsorships, they had the capacity to be pretty funny,
79360	80960	to my juvenile brain at least.
80960	84280	However, it was one day that I clicked on one of the videos, I highly doubt I could
84280	88440	find it now, but I remember it being this page called Unilad, and it was this post,
88440	92800	with this guy, and he had this really strange accent, talking about manly drinks versus
92800	111240	girly drinks, basically mocking the gender stereotypes behind alcoholic beverages.
111240	114040	And to be honest, I didn't really know what to think.
114040	117840	It was alright enough, and I did agree with the sentiment I'd personally take cocktails
117840	122040	over beer any day, either way, I didn't really think too much about it, my life had
122040	124280	very little to do with YouTube back then.
124280	129540	However, that man in the video was GradeAUnderA, or Grade for short, he is a commentator with
129540	133600	a very distinct style, and I'll talk about the styles that he was inspired by in a bit,
133600	137680	but as you can see from that clip, it bathes in the rather amateurish charm.
137680	142260	Currently Grade sits on just shy of 3 and a half million subscribers, and is very prolific
142260	146980	in the commentary community for both positive and not so positive reasons, but I didn't
146980	149980	know that back then, I was just another pleb.
149980	153900	Fast forward a couple years, and I was much more engaged in the commentary community,
153900	157980	all this drama with Leafy was transpiring, I wasn't really an avid viewer of him, but
157980	162080	I was thoroughly involved in the whole feud with Keemstar, and I remember really rallying
162080	167260	behind Leafy, I think I even sent him an email in support, which was incredibly sad, not
167260	171380	just the sentiment of it, but the fact that I used email, I'm like Benjamin Button because
171420	175140	I used to be a boomer, and now I'm an epic, woke man.
175140	179960	And then iDubbbz's content cop dropped, and I had my perception completely 180'd, everything
179960	184300	I thought was true was not, and iDubbbz did a decent job at destroying Leafy, who then
184300	188700	managed to destroy himself with his own response video, proving he was well out of his depth,
188700	191180	but that my friends is a story for another time.
191180	194860	Grade was dragged into all of this because he'd made videos on the situation, and jumped
194860	199140	on the Keemstar hate train, in fact he'd been quite involved in the drama, until the
199140	203800	content cop in which he kinda just slid out the back door, I wonder why, and after a few
203800	208300	more months of videos, he was gone, he was just kinda moved on, there were a few thought
208300	213080	pieces asking where he'd gone, how he'd fallen from grace, how he'd lost his groove
213080	219680	and so on, everyone kinda knew he'd return, and at the turn of 2019, he did, for a bit.
219680	224300	How long he'll be around, I don't know, honestly, he's probably left already, but
224300	228260	at the same time, his return did complete an arc that I felt necessary to make this
228300	229300	video.
229300	233300	I always felt there was more to his story, because my two experiences with his content
233300	237740	were radically different, covering themes that could have been related to a different
237740	238740	channel.
238740	242740	My perception going into this is that of a person who became something else than he initially
242740	247900	set out to be, from that person on my Facebook feed, it never felt like he was setting himself
247900	250860	up to become another channel caught up in the drama.
250860	254920	So today, and probably next week as well, if you're not familiar with the tale of
254920	259240	Grade A Under Ray, I want this to be a learning experience, not just for you, but also for
259240	260240	me.
260240	263000	We're going to understand his rise, his peak, and even his fall, but we're not just
263000	267600	going to be documenting how it happened, we'll be asking why it happened, and maybe providing
267600	271160	some opinions on the whole situation along the way, let's just hope they're the right
271160	272160	ones.
272160	273160	Are you ready?
273160	274160	Good.
274160	275160	Let's go.
275160	287080	Grade A Under Ray started his channel in January 2013, back in the days before any
287080	289760	real commentary community was particularly well defined.
289760	293980	At the time, a lot of the largest creators were comedians, a lot of these were skits
293980	298500	and sketches, people like Nigahiga, Steve Cardinal, you know that guy who did songs
298500	302080	in real life and chat roulette versions of songs that would probably have been copyright
302080	308120	claimed as shit, Jenna Marbles, Bad Lip Reading, Smosh, Rhett and Link, and plenty plenty more.
308120	312240	The quality was in the individual's videos, and the value held within them rather than
312240	313240	just the channel.
313240	316940	That's not to say these people didn't have a personality, they did, but it was challenged
316940	321380	more into constructing a persona for certain purposes rather than necessarily feeling the
321380	322720	authentic connection.
322720	326720	There was rumblings of some commentary in the form of political content, but not everyone
326720	327960	was really looking for that.
327960	331900	In fact, if you wanted a connection to a creator on a more personal level, then you'd have
331900	336660	to look towards the gaming content, and I'm not saying that gaming content typically
336660	341580	had people learning that much about the person, but at the end of it all a lot of gaming YouTubers
341580	346380	did tend to be pretty genuine in their reactions, and that led to a lot of diversity in the
346380	347420	actual delivery.
347420	351840	I discussed it briefly in my Toby Turner video, back then if you had something going on upstairs
351840	355420	you could sit down and play a game and there would be an audience if you were competent
355420	359300	enough, and that's why you would likely find a lot of modern commentary audiences
359300	361540	probably watch gaming videos at one point.
361540	364620	I know I did, do I sound like a huge epic gamer?
364620	365620	No?
365620	366620	Well, I am.
366620	367620	Bitches.
367620	372320	commentary wasn't really going to emerge until 2015, and yet great is a very interesting
372320	374260	case because he emerged before that.
374260	375700	How exactly did he do that?
375700	381360	Well, the only real genre that had established itself at the time with a firm basis in opinions
381360	386340	was the film and music criticism genre, and that still had a long way to go, but by 2013
386340	390440	there was a fairly nice assortment of critics in these circles, and I wanted to take this
390440	395200	and then apply it to someone who I know as a dose of Buckley, and what he did was typically
395200	399680	a mix of criticism, but also commentary, with a comedic stinging tone to it.
399680	403820	He always described himself as a comedian primarily, and I do have a lot to say about
403820	408160	him as well, but you can definitely see where these various roots were in Grey's content.
408160	412800	Grey was a real mix of comedy, commentary, but also one more component, which was story,
412800	417280	and I've spoken about storytime animators before, but there is a distinct similarity
417280	422000	in Grey's early content to many of the animators that we see nowadays.
422000	425520	Storytime animators typically run a structure where they speak with a narrative, they set
425520	429960	the scene, and then they re-enact the scene, typically in a comedic way that entertains
429960	430960	the audience.
430960	435020	However, with all that said, Grey still had to convince his viewers that his content was
435020	438520	worth watching, and that means not being absolute crap.
438520	441600	Grey Day Under Ray were the two characters that represented him.
441600	446040	On one side you have the Grey Day, the smart successful side, and on the other side is
446040	451160	the under-ray, the underachiever, the scruffy lazy character, and he wanted to present
451160	453320	both of these sides in his channel.
453320	457960	When watching Grey's first video, 9 Things I Hate About The Barber Shop, this style becomes
457960	458960	quite clear.
458960	461760	He talks about what he doesn't like, and then he'll provide a demonstration.
461760	466080	However, whereas with animators some of the appeal comes to balance between the style
466080	470720	and the persona, Grey tends to discard elaborate visuals for an extremely simple style, thus
470720	474200	focusing a majority of the draw on his own delivery.
474200	477560	And although this video didn't initially grab traction like the videos we'll talk
477560	481280	about soon, we can actually witness some very successful comedy.
481280	483500	It's simple, to the point, and over the top.
483500	488640	In many ways, Grey's channel was an amalgamation of various genres that were currently prevailing.
488640	493360	He was a comedian, but he was also a storyteller who was conveying his own personal experiences,
493360	498520	albeit in an exaggerated manner, tapping into the relatable frustrations of the daily life,
498520	501520	and applying a little bit of attitude to give him the edge.
501560	504320	Plenty of people had the exact same thoughts about him.
504320	508640	For example, everyone goes to school, what makes Grey's experiences or thoughts on
508640	509640	it remotely exceptional?
509640	514320	Well, it's the energy he brings, and the fact that people like hearing him talk about
514320	515320	it.
515320	516320	And that's a genuine talent.
516320	518320	Here's a clip from his first upload.
532520	535520	And my hair went from amazing to shit.
535520	536520	How did you do that?
536520	539520	I'm more impressed than anything.
539520	540520	Number four.
540520	546520	And after he's ruined your hair, he has the nerve to look you in the eye, and ask you,
546520	548520	what do you think, mate?
548520	550520	And you tell him it looks good.
550520	552520	Every time.
552520	554520	Number five.
554520	556520	And then you pay him for it.
556520	558520	And you pay him for fucking your hair up.
558520	559520	Why did I do that?
559520	560520	I should have told you no.
560520	561520	You're not getting my money.
561520	562520	You cunt.
562520	563520	Look what you've done.
563520	564520	Give me a wig.
564520	567520	A lot of the best comedy comes down to rhetoric.
567520	570520	Anyone can think of a funny punchline or a decent joke here and there, but what makes
570520	574520	the greatest comedians great is the fact that they can take a story and they can tell it
574520	575520	in a funny way.
575520	576520	How does Grey do that?
576520	578520	Part of it is the articulation.
578520	582520	Grey does a great technique of expression, his skewed accent does help in a way, but
582520	584520	here what you're doing is he's setting up a story.
584520	585520	Let me set the scene.
585520	586520	We're at slide four now.
586520	589520	We've known the slides before, he's shown a few examples.
589520	591520	And then for slide four, he changes the style.
591520	596520	He provides the setup and he's really satisfied with his haircut and he conveys that with
596520	597520	his tone.
597520	599520	And about halfway through, it starts to look good.
599520	602520	It starts to look really, really nice.
602520	605520	And it builds to the payoff because he sounds proper pleased, but we all know he's going
605520	608520	to lose his shit and we're anticipating it.
608520	609520	And then he snaps.
609520	611520	But by the end of it, it looks dog shit.
611520	613520	What did you do?
613520	614520	I blinked.
614520	615520	I blinked to me.
615520	618520	And my hair went from amazing to shit.
618520	619520	How did you do that?
619520	621520	I'm more impressed than anything.
621520	625520	And he does a good job of providing the viewers with that sense of comedic catharsis.
625520	630520	And if you can build up to something and set up some sentiment of nerve in that audience,
630520	632520	then you'll make the payoff funnier.
632520	637520	Comedy is not just about contrast, but it's about audience investment in that contrast.
637520	641520	The other thing I find interesting is he leaves these pauses in the buildup, which leave the
641520	645520	sort of dead air with the audience, which, you know, if I did it in my videos,
646520	648520	it wouldn't make sense.
648520	652520	But in his works, it plays off the tension, like that in a horror movie.
652520	656520	Tension makes the scares scarier, just as it makes the jokes funnier.
656520	657520	But that's not all at play here.
657520	663520	I recall a very good video by The Nerd Writer, which spoke about Louis CK's tant at the delivery of jokes.
663520	666520	And one of the overarching themes is that no word is wasted.
666520	671520	And that's something I'd describe as perfectly prevalent in great early comedy.
671520	676520	And about halfway through, it starts to look good. It starts to look really, really nice.
677520	679520	But by the end of it, it looks dogshit.
679520	683520	What did you do? I blinked. I blinked to make.
683520	685520	And not a single one is wasted.
685520	690520	They're used either in meaning or in rhythm to contribute to the overall effect,
690520	695520	an effect that lets us see the world from a different angle and, more importantly, makes us laugh.
695520	699520	It's those details which add value to great work, makes it more entertaining
699520	702520	and does give him an edge over the contemporaries at the time.
702520	706520	Combine that with the rather cheap and simple style, which doesn't distract from his delivery
706520	709520	and can often add a snark visual gag or so.
709520	713520	It's simple but effective, and I want to make this point that no one reaches the size of Grey
713520	715520	without some kind of unique feature.
715520	720520	Grey's initial appeal was a mix of features, which crafted this very distinctive persona.
720520	724520	And although I'm sure many of his critics and advocates would argue whether he's actually funny,
724520	727520	it's hard to dispute that he was successful.
727520	729520	And success has its reasons.
729520	733520	But as many will say, success isn't just about being good at what you're doing,
733520	735520	you have to be good at selling it as well.
735520	739520	And this is where we go into the very weird second stage of Grey's career.
742520	747520	Grey's second video was uploaded in April 2013 and was called
747520	752520	Girlie Drinks vs Manly Drinks, a now infamous video in which Grey rants about how social norms
752520	757520	pressure him to avoid consuming drinks that taste nice and push him towards drinks like beer and bitter
757520	759520	which affirm his status as a man.
759520	764520	It's hyperbolic and ridiculous, but it's ironically decent social comedy with a good dash of humour.
764520	767520	And so he released this video, and it didn't do much at all.
767520	771520	Actually, it was his second video. YouTube hadn't really paid much attention to his channel.
771520	774520	They're probably pushing the newest Rihanna song or something.
774520	776520	What was Rihanna doing in 2013?
776520	779520	Stay? God, do I feel old.
779520	783520	So there is this site called Reddit, I don't know if any of you have heard of it,
783520	787520	but for anyone who genuinely doesn't follow it, it's basically a site that serves as a collective of forums
787520	791520	or what they call subreddits for people to find others who might share interests
791520	793520	and then to post in them and maybe comment on them.
793520	797520	And this can be basically anything at all, within the guidelines of course,
797520	799520	from homosexuality to mean girls.
799520	802520	And I'm really not a regular of Reddit, but I know that much.
802520	806520	Subreddit that is the focus of this part is r slash videos,
806520	809520	which is a forum where people can post content that they like.
809520	812520	It is a fairly well organised subreddit with users galore,
812520	815520	and various tabs that can basically arrange the post how you would like them.
815520	820520	However, the very important tab here is obviously what was called in 2014 the hot tab.
820520	824520	Now, Gray's video isn't doing too much, it had been a year and a half since release,
824520	830520	and yet a user by the quaint name of Bonerboy, lovely, posted his video to the r slash videos subreddit
830520	832520	with the title as the caption.
832520	835520	Now unfortunately, I do not have a screenshot of it doing the rounds
835520	837520	because there weren't any that I could find,
837520	840520	but there is one of the post itself very briefly after it was posted,
840520	843520	and you can see that it quickly picked up steam,
843520	847520	receiving appraisal from many of the users who enjoyed his crude style in reading the comments.
847520	851520	It hearkens back to my earlier comparisons with regards to animators too,
851520	855520	with many people suggesting that content would have fit very aptly into the Newgrounds site,
855520	858520	a website renowned for the animators it hosted.
858520	860520	And that's what this video hit home with.
860520	864520	Gray seemed like a throwback creator with a twist thrown in, and the masses had spoken.
864520	867520	They decided that this is the content they wanted, but Gray was gone.
867520	871520	He had legitimately forgot he even made a YouTube account.
871520	873520	I mean, hell, he didn't even have an avatar.
873520	875520	The under-a side was clearly taking over.
875520	879520	In fact, Gray was on Facebook when he saw his video being shared,
879520	882520	and realised that suddenly he had an audience, and an audience to answer to,
882520	886520	and as acknowledged in a tweet he'd make a year later, it kicked his channel off.
886520	889520	So if Bonerboy hadn't made that post on that Reddit,
889520	892520	Gray probably would have never uploaded another YouTube video.
892520	894520	And yet, here we are.
894520	898520	With the success of his content, Gray made a video committing to more uploads,
898520	903520	and unlike 90% of the creators who commit to more uploads before disappearing off the face of the Earth,
903520	906520	he actually stayed true to his word, for now.
906520	908520	And we witness some spicy content.
908520	911520	His video following this was known as the Paralympics,
911520	914520	and this is where Gray begins to really cement that persona.
914520	916520	I've spoken about how his content can be funny,
916520	919520	but being good and being popular are not the same,
919520	924520	and having mass appeal can often mean you might sacrifice niche qualities that you may take preference to.
924520	926520	But Gray was very consistent.
926520	929520	He took a perspective of great ignorance.
929520	931520	Now that might sound like a criticism,
931520	936520	it would be if I went to Gray's channel looking for insightful commentary or some bold truth teller,
936520	939520	but you don't, you go for crude jokes from a judgemental twat,
939520	942520	and the thing about ignorance is that for many people, it is relatable.
942520	946520	Most people don't know much about a lot, doesn't mean they're stupid,
946520	951520	some people have a few subjects in which they specialize in due to career reasons or specific interests,
951520	953520	but ignorance is relatable in a way,
953520	956520	and so you have videos that may not be completely accurate,
956520	959520	but you get the impression that they're quite aware they're not,
959520	962520	because he's putting on a stupid voice, he's allowed to be stupid,
962520	967520	but at the same time, he's playing with the cynical, judgemental thoughts that cross many people's minds,
967520	969520	like do horse jockeys even do anything?
969520	971520	Surely it's the horse that needs to be disabled.
971520	974520	The dumbest thing on earth.
974520	977520	Paralympic horse riding.
977520	982520	The reason it's so dumb is that it's not the horse that has to be disabled,
982520	985520	it's the rider.
985520	989520	You don't do anything rider, you just sit there.
989520	995520	So for example these two fine chaps, they can't be in the Paralympics,
995520	1000520	but this Lloyd's TSB majestic stallion could,
1000520	1005520	because his rider's missing a finger or an eyebrow or something.
1005520	1009520	Now I'm sure with a bit of research you'd find out otherwise, but people don't care.
1009520	1013520	It's easier to think about it simply and get a laugh out of someone's rants.
1013520	1016520	He's the comedian who says the stupid stuff and gets the laugh,
1016520	1019520	because it's somewhat based in the assumptions that people make themselves.
1019520	1021520	It is relatable in its ignorance.
1021520	1025520	During the last few months of 2014, in the wake of his son's success,
1025520	1028520	Grade would upload multiple videos in the same format,
1028520	1030520	just talking about stuff in this style.
1030520	1034520	This would cement him as a creator and lead to significant and consistent growth
1034520	1036520	throughout the coming few months.
1036520	1040520	He would rant about Tinder, toilets, interviews, basically anything that bothered him.
1040520	1043520	He'd become more and more creative with these gags,
1043520	1048520	make longer content but still hold on to many of the rather simplistic aspects of his videos,
1048520	1050520	balancing that feeling of progression.
1050520	1055520	With the notion of familiarity, like upgrading a car rather than purchasing a new model.
1055520	1059520	You still need to make people feel like they're watching a Grade A under A video.
1059520	1062520	When the video that we're discussing today came around,
1062520	1065520	Ray was sat on a respectable 29,000 subscribers.
1065520	1069520	His growth had been solid and steady with occasional spikes aided by the algorithm.
1069520	1072520	His videos typically surpassed his subscriber count
1072520	1075520	and he was being aided by various supports on other websites.
1075520	1077520	Obviously I mentioned my encounter with a Facebook post.
1077520	1079520	However, we're entering 2015.
1079520	1081520	And you know what that means?
1081520	1084520	Well, the start of a little genre called commentary,
1084520	1086520	believe you who is someone I'm sure we'll talk about eventually,
1086520	1090520	sat mid-February on around 23,000 subscribers.
1090520	1094520	Fairly respectable, that's only because most of them came from a Minecraft PVP channel.
1094520	1098520	However, under a month later, Grade would get his first taste of drama
1098520	1100520	with someone known as Ray William Johnson.
1100520	1104520	Ray William Johnson was one of the largest creators on the platform
1104520	1107520	and although he wasn't anywhere near his peak at this time,
1107520	1110520	he was still pulling respectable numbers on his videos,
1110520	1114520	the sort of numbers that I would dream about getting on a constant basis.
1114520	1118520	He had a lot of successful ventures, so calling him out was a pretty big deal
1118520	1121520	because you're going to be dealing with his still sizable fanbase,
1121520	1124520	this guy on over 10 million subscribers.
1124520	1126520	So, what happened?
1126520	1128520	I'm late all the time.
1128520	1132520	I am probably gonna be late for work every day.
1135520	1138520	So tell me about a weakness of yours.
1138520	1140520	Oh my god, where to start?
1140520	1143520	What would you say is your greatest weakness?
1143520	1145520	Where do I start? Uhh...
1147520	1150520	Right, where do you see yourself in five years' time?
1150520	1153520	Hopefully, not still in this shithole.
1153520	1156520	Where do you see yourself in five years?
1156520	1157520	Not in this shithole.
1157520	1160520	Well, shit.
1165520	1172520	To understand the situation, we go back to the video before it,
1172520	1176520	Why I Hate Interviews, in which Grey goes on one of his typical rants
1176520	1179520	interspersed with his comedy that we've previously discussed.
1179520	1181520	At some point in this video, he mocks up an interview
1181520	1184520	and responds to it in a fairly candid fashion.
1184520	1187520	Eleven days later, Ray William Johnson uploads the video
1187520	1191520	How To Ace Job Interviews, a sarcastic title for a run of sketches
1191520	1194520	in which the applicant provides the worst answers possible.
1194520	1196520	However, some of these responses, more specifically,
1196520	1199520	three of them had a strange resemblance to Grey's answers.
1199520	1200520	And you know what?
1200520	1202520	That's certainly not something to be ignored,
1202520	1205520	especially when it's one of the site's largest creators,
1205520	1208520	stealing from a significantly smaller creator.
1208520	1210520	But what's Grey gonna do about it?
1210520	1213520	Now we're in March 2015, commentaries hasn't merged yet,
1213520	1215520	but we're definitely in the rumblings of it.
1215520	1218520	And I want to talk about drama for a brief moment for that reason.
1218520	1220520	Drama always existed,
1220520	1223520	especially when you're dealing with genres that involve personalities
1223520	1226520	rather than just personas, which is why the gaming community,
1226520	1229520	in spite of their relatively avoidant attitude to drama,
1229520	1230520	did have their incidents.
1230520	1233520	Commentary in the last few years, however, has taken over the drama scene,
1233520	1236520	because for many commentators, it is highly beneficial for their channel
1236520	1238520	that they talk about drama.
1238520	1240520	And it's like the media when they report an incident.
1240520	1243520	Often it's not just the drama itself that guards the attention,
1243520	1245520	but the people who actually cover it.
1245520	1249520	You're always looking for the hot take from that one person you want to hear talk.
1249520	1253520	With that said, Grey didn't have the same approach that many commentators do today.
1253520	1256520	If I felt someone had ripped me off, unfortunately I wouldn't be able to turn around
1256520	1259520	and make a 30 minute video, as fun as it might be.
1259520	1262520	In fact, many commentators wouldn't want to make a video on someone
1262520	1266520	who might have copied their joke, because it would be seen as petty or going overboard.
1266520	1268520	This is where we bring in Grey's style.
1268520	1271520	Grey's comedy was found with him being excessive.
1271520	1274520	His videos could also be very short and not really have much meaning.
1274520	1277520	So he made this video questioning whether Grey had quote, plagiarised him.
1277520	1280520	He opened with the corresponding clips in question, before doing this.
1307520	1316520	Now this isn't the last time he would use this demeanor.
1316520	1321520	What he's doing is he's using comedy as a masquerade to push quite genuine accusations.
1321520	1326520	Grey's videos felt tongue-in-cheek enough to not necessarily take seriously in their tone,
1326520	1329520	they were too self-aware and comedic to frame him negatively,
1329520	1333520	but their arguments too well presented to completely ignore in their points.
1333520	1336520	If we're speaking formally, you can't really prove that Grey was plagiarising,
1336520	1339520	because as concepts, they're a bit too general to be claimed,
1339520	1342520	but it is very plausible that Grey did take the jokes.
1342520	1345520	It does seem a bit too similar to be a coincidence.
1345520	1350520	Grey's video on this quickly gained traction and hit over 200,000 views in a few days.
1350520	1353520	I mean, calling anyone out is always good for a quick rush of views,
1353520	1356520	and although at first it wasn't universally well received,
1356520	1360520	you can see the like-dislike ratio is still strongly in his favour.
1360520	1363520	Compare this to a recent drama, for example Coffee Break's video,
1363520	1365520	which I do plan on discussing in the future,
1365520	1368520	because he mainly framed his problems very seriously,
1368520	1371520	many people have now responded and began to call him petty,
1371520	1374520	which has affected many people's feeling about the whole drama.
1374520	1376520	As Grey goes, he's done pretty well.
1376520	1380520	This was his first taste of drama, but not really much came beyond of it.
1380520	1383520	There was an article written on the Daily Dots and a bit of buzz at the time,
1383520	1385520	but Johnson never really responded.
1385520	1387520	Because Grey was such a small YouTuber at the time,
1387520	1389520	he would have been punching down fairly hard,
1389520	1393520	and he probably didn't want to strengthen it unless he had a concrete response,
1393520	1394520	which would have been hard.
1394520	1397520	So life went on, Grey did alright from the situation,
1397520	1401520	and decided to go back to the sort of content that people at that time knew him for.
1401520	1403520	However, this was about to change again,
1403520	1407520	because now we're in June, and a little-known YouTuber by the name of Leafy
1407520	1409520	was beginning to gather significant momentum.
1409520	1413520	Grey, in a similar position, decided once again to make a different kind of video,
1413520	1418520	this time calling out a YouTuber by the name of Richard Burgess, aka Vegan Gains.
1418520	1423520	Basically, a blatant bait video, because Vegan Gains was known to respond to everyone.
1423520	1426520	His video alleged that Vegan Gains was fairly dishonest in his content,
1426520	1429520	unbelievably biased towards anyone on a vegan diet,
1429520	1434520	and promotes a lot of misinformation that people should definitely take with a grain of salt.
1434520	1437520	However, at the end of the video, Grey takes a slightly different approach.
1437520	1438520	You damn good as well.
1438520	1440520	But the ones now, they're just garbage.
1440520	1444520	Now hopefully, I don't have to make any more videos about you.
1444520	1448520	I've already made two other videos that are ready to be uploaded in like a second's notice, right?
1448520	1453520	One of the videos that I have is one of his worst of the YouTube fitness industry videos
1453520	1456520	that I stole when I hacked into Vegan Gains' computer.
1456520	1458520	Because I'm a hacker, me, right?
1458520	1461520	And it's one he didn't upload for very good reason.
1461520	1464520	It's not one he would want you seeing, trust me.
1464520	1466520	And as if that wasn't saucy enough,
1466520	1471520	the other video that I've got is a personal video message to Vegan Gains
1471520	1474520	from a very fucking surprising source.
1475520	1478520	Now this is where Grey's very ambiguous tone comes into play.
1478520	1480520	It's quite clear that he isn't a hacker,
1480520	1484520	but it's still possible that he's managed to get his hands onto some sort of incriminating file.
1484520	1486520	Vegan Gains is a volatile character,
1486520	1492520	and it's not impossible to suggest that maybe there are a few deleted videos of him floating around the web
1492520	1494520	that have him doing some pretty strong things.
1494520	1496520	Grey presents him with the quote,
1496520	1497520	Ultimatum.
1497520	1501520	Responder is going to make another video where he uploads everything.
1501520	1503520	Listen, this is just me being a bit of an idiot, right?
1503520	1504520	This is just playful banter, yeah?
1504520	1508520	But listen, Vegan Gains, if you don't reply to this video and explain yourself
1508520	1512520	and address all the points I've brought up in this video and explain your lies, right?
1512520	1516520	I will take it as a personal insult, and I will post both of them, right?
1516520	1518520	Man, listen, I like you, mate.
1518520	1522520	You're a bit annoying here and there, but overall, I do like you, mate.
1522520	1525520	Don't make me post those videos, man.
1525520	1528520	So Vegan Gains decided to respond by, well, not responding.
1528520	1530520	This clearly caught Grey off,
1530520	1533520	because Vegan Gains was renowned for going after people,
1533520	1536520	and yet like Donald Trump not responding to Eminem,
1536520	1539520	the one time where you'd expect him to respond, he didn't.
1539520	1541520	So when Vegan Gains didn't respond,
1541520	1546520	Grey uploaded the update video that threatened to release the three very important unseen videos,
1546520	1548520	providing a specific due date,
1548520	1551520	that being Saturday the 4th of July 2015.
1551520	1555520	Once again, having this sort of due date makes Grey seem more serious
1555520	1559520	and presents this to Vegan Gains to encourage that response.
1559520	1563520	He hypes it up and says we all need to tweet it at the Vegan Gains nemeses,
1563520	1565520	and obtain their attention.
1565520	1568520	Everyone's on the edge of his seats. What's Grey going to reveal?
1568520	1571520	Well, not much. In fact, Grey was just bluffing.
1571520	1575520	The third video was released, and the alleged clips were presented were not as expected.
1575520	1578520	If you expected anything at all, that is.
1578520	1583520	One of them was a cut-up compilation where you know the one where you remix someone's speech to change the message.
1583520	1587520	The second video, a special message from someone, was another meme,
1587520	1592520	and the rest of the video was spent going through Vegan Gains' old channel and just digging up various comments.
1592520	1596520	From one perspective, it could be seen as rather desperate from Grey,
1596520	1599520	to basically threaten someone into giving you their attention.
1599520	1602520	And he makes it no secret, that's kind of what he was trying to do.
1602520	1607520	Okay, now listen, if I'm honest, I said that if Vegan Gains didn't reply to my previous video,
1607520	1609520	that I would then release these other two, right?
1609520	1613520	Which was a complete lie, like regardless of what he did, I was still going to upload him, right?
1613520	1616520	And yet, coming out of it, he received very little criticism,
1616520	1620520	and appeared with a big W to his name. Why is that?
1620520	1623520	Well, firstly, Vegan Gains isn't really popular,
1623520	1625520	and people can't really feel bad for him,
1625520	1628520	regardless of whether he was right or not to respond.
1628520	1632520	And a lot of Grey's criticisms in his first video were fairly valid.
1632520	1636520	But the second reason this little stunt worked was because of his persona, Grade-A Under-A.
1636520	1639520	In his comedy videos, you don't really see that contrast too much,
1639520	1645520	but in these more drama-oriented videos, on one hand you have the Grade-A side that can deliver criticism,
1645520	1651520	and yet the uneven delivery, and the messy tone, and the comedy falls towards the Under-A side.
1651520	1654520	And this meant that as long as he acknowledged his intentions,
1654520	1657520	with enough self-awareness, he'd typically receive a pass.
1657520	1662520	This is interesting because while he emerged in a time where comedy dominated YouTube,
1662520	1666520	clearly reflected in his style, we were entering a more dramatic phase.
1666520	1670520	The times were changing, and Grade had to change with them as well.
1670520	1673520	But to do that, we have to understand drama.
1675520	1688520	The Thing About Drama
1688520	1691520	The thing about drama is that there are various routes you can take.
1691520	1695520	You can take the route of being the moralist, being the person who dictates how you should act,
1695520	1700520	down to the small details, what words you should and shouldn't use, etc.
1700520	1705520	If you want to deal criticism like that, you need to set an example of how to deal it.
1705520	1710520	On the other hand, you have people who don't give a shit about 90% of things when they're criticising others,
1710520	1715520	and although this might seem less pure in many of their characteristics, it makes them harder to criticise.
1715520	1720520	A great example of this is iDubbbz, another significant player later on in the story.
1720520	1724520	Some people may criticise him for his fairly nonchalant approach to the use of certain words,
1724520	1727520	as shown in the Tana Mongeau content copy made,
1727520	1732520	but he turns this around and says, well I don't think that defines my morality, so take it or leave it.
1732520	1736520	You can criticise him, but you can't really end him or cancel him,
1736520	1740520	because what he did was proxy to a much greater point against the target,
1740520	1744520	and regardless of how much Twitter would like to paint it as a black and white issue,
1744520	1746520	you'll experience very different attitudes.
1746520	1752520	With Vegan Gains, Grade isn't necessarily behaving morally, in fact he comes across as a bit of a pest,
1753520	1758520	but he doesn't need to behave morally because he kind of acknowledges it and integrates it into his persona,
1758520	1762520	often acknowledging the fact that you're not perfect can humanise yourself in the eyes of your viewers,
1762520	1765520	while being able to deliver some sort of criticism.
1765520	1771520	In the instance of Vegan Gains, he is a liar, and being a liar is an easy criticism because it implies a logical falsehood.
1771520	1776520	It's typically rather simple, unless you can appeal to a greater good, like a white lie.
1776520	1780520	With the success of this drama, in spite of the disappointing lack of response,
1780520	1784520	Grade would begin to start doing these sorts of videos a bit more regularly,
1784520	1788520	and the thing is, I don't think a lot of people really notice much difference in the videos,
1788520	1793520	mainly because Grade had such a grip on his style, his character encompassed all those topics,
1793520	1795520	and he definitely takes this going forward.
1795520	1800520	His next targets were Jinx and CJSoCool, two fairly unpopular reaction channels,
1800520	1806520	who were notorious for basically playing videos and reacting to them in a way that provided no level of transformation whatsoever.
1806520	1811520	Grade's video on them was a lot tighter in its points and used pretty affirmative evidence to convey his sentiments.
1812520	1817520	Now listen to this, right? It's like a 17 minute, 16 second video, right?
1817520	1823520	Of which, literally 45 seconds is not KSI's video.
1823520	1828520	So CJ's video is literally over 95% KSI, right?
1828520	1830520	Which is ridiculous!
1830520	1834520	Obviously they're gonna get popularity if they're stealing some of the biggest YouTuber's content, right?
1834520	1835520	That's so hard, isn't it?
1835520	1840520	Now what must have particularly pleased Grade in this situation was that Jinx actually responded,
1840520	1843520	and he responded with all the grace that you'd expect from a reaction channel.
1843520	1850520	Now first thing I wanna say before I even start going down this list is the fact that this guy hates me because I'm popular.
1850520	1852520	Because I'm YouTube popular.
1852520	1855520	That is the one reason that it all boils down to.
1855520	1859520	He can say he's not a hater, he can say all of that, but let's just be honest.
1859520	1864520	And when you make a well-formed call-out video, going after channels who clearly think they are much better than they are,
1864520	1866520	it feels good for the audience to be a part of that.
1867520	1873520	The main reason it felt so good for many of Grade's fans was because Grade had intertwined it very delicately with his comedy.
1873520	1877520	His comedy being rooted in that relatability of the judgemental nature.
1877520	1882520	We've all seen some very successful YouTubers and thought, what the hell do they do that's special?
1882520	1883520	They're rubbish.
1883520	1890520	Grade took these thoughts and turned them into videos and combined them with more concise points and evidence to convince people of his case.
1890520	1895520	So even when he was being fairly blunt, it felt natural because his persona allowed him to do that.
1895520	1900520	Reaction channels are basically like a place for you to watch a video with someone else.
1900520	1904520	What the fuck, mate? That's one of the stupidest things I've ever heard.
1904520	1907520	I might as well go out and buy a blow-up doll. It's less annoying than you.
1907520	1912520	A response from Jinx, even like that, trying to be as indirect as possible is more attention,
1912520	1917520	because someone's going to ask what the video is, someone's going to know, and they're going to redirect it.
1917520	1921520	Especially if you're going after a larger YouTuber, who is an idiot.
1921520	1926520	Jinx had no personality, so trying to show any sort of anger felt like arrogance,
1926520	1929520	because it could only be correlated with his size, not his persona.
1929520	1935520	Through this, however, Grade did create a fanbase that were involved in the more dramatic side of Grade's work.
1935520	1938520	And following this, he went after more easy targets.
1938520	1943520	Nicole Arbour, prank channels, Nicole Arbour again, prank channels again, prank channels again.
1943520	1948520	And although these videos were fairly decent in a lot of their criticism, with a fair amount of evidence,
1948520	1953520	when you spend so much time dishing out copious amounts of criticism in the sort of tone that Grade did,
1953520	1958520	it became inevitable that he was going to grow out a channel much more drama-oriented.
1958520	1965520	Now, looking back in retrospect, it becomes clear that a lot of his more story-time-oriented content has outperformed his drama videos.
1965520	1971520	However, at the same time, his drama videos were some of the most popular on the site in the moment.
1971520	1975520	This was mainly because commentary was emerging with the people we've already discussed,
1975520	1978520	entering the stage where people felt comfortable calling others out.
1978520	1983520	With the rise of three pretty pivotal channels, we could see the tone of criticism evolving.
1983520	1989520	I identify these three channels as H3, iDubbbz, and obviously our main man here, GradeAUnderA.
1989520	1993520	All of these channels became porchbearers in calling out who they deemed to be twats.
1993520	1998520	This then brought a secondary wave of channels who typically focused their content on other topics,
1998520	2004520	but would often drop by on commentary issues, such as I Hate Everything, Pyrocynical, Leafy Boogie, and so on.
2004520	2010520	It was something fun to involve yourself in, and on top of this, it created more attention to the topics that people were discussing.
2010520	2018520	This was catalysed by the numerous incidents at the turn of 2016, alongside the launch of iDubbbz's series, Content Cop,
2018520	2025520	which basically set commentary on fire, particularly the Jinx episode, which of course, almost led to the infamous boxing match.
2025520	2030520	Don't get it twisted, Grade was one of the first on the scene to make these sorts of videos,
2030520	2036520	with an already established audience that identified the style, and therefore benefited of this development greatly.
2036520	2040520	Equally in a perverted way, the drama videos worked in the vein that his comedy videos did.
2040520	2047520	Judgemental twats and relatability, we have those feelings towards those creators, that's why he went after unpopular people,
2047520	2053520	because many people already hated them. When you're targeting other people, you have to be prepared to become a target,
2053520	2059520	and 2016 was a new year for many reasons, many reasons that we'll find out in the next video.
2059520	2065520	Because this script is going to be very long, and I've learned that it's probably not best to exhaust your audience to that extent,
2065520	2068520	though other videos definitely have had me trying.
2073520	2078520	So that was the video, I really hope you guys enjoyed it, I want to give a big shoutout to my editors,
2078520	2083520	who've once again done a fantastic, beautiful job, I love them very much.

2099520	2106520	all the three of you, thank you so much, it does genuinely make a difference, especially with YouTube's slightly unpredictable behaviour recently.
2106520	2113520	$100 too, I have to give the mention to Brandon and Ryan, truly incredible people,
2113520	2118520	and eternally grateful for their support, thank you guys, it makes a big difference.
