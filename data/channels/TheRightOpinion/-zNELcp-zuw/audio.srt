1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Grade A under A.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Grade A under A.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Grade A under A.

4
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Grade A under A.

5
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Grade A under A.

6
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Grade A under A.

7
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,800
So a lot of newcomers to the website who may stumble across Grade's channel, Grade A under

8
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:13,000
A, may not even realize why Grade was so important in the first place.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,200
Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with

10
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,760
too much free time, and today we talk about someone who I've had a lot of requests to

11
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,500
cover but never really quite got around to, well, today, my friends, is the time I finally

12
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,500
address it.

13
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:49,560
Now, in keeping with the old routine, we'll begin this video with a nice little story,

14
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,900
because I love a good story like anyone else.

15
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:55,600
When I was growing up, I wasn't really the type of person who used Twitter, or any of

16
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,560
the social media sites that I use today.

17
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:01,400
I was at school, and back then the only app that was really considered fashionable was

18
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,400
Facebook.

19
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:06,580
Now this is before Facebook was taken over by mums and their minion memes, but just take

20
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:11,080
my word, at some point Facebook was cool, I promise guys, please don't reject me.

21
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:14,920
At the time, it was cool to follow ridiculous numbers of Facebook pages, and before they

22
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:19,360
were taken over by cash farm sponsorships, they had the capacity to be pretty funny,

23
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,960
to my juvenile brain at least.

24
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,280
However, it was one day that I clicked on one of the videos, I highly doubt I could

25
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:28,440
find it now, but I remember it being this page called Unilad, and it was this post,

26
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:32,800
with this guy, and he had this really strange accent, talking about manly drinks versus

27
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:51,240
girly drinks, basically mocking the gender stereotypes behind alcoholic beverages.

28
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,040
And to be honest, I didn't really know what to think.

29
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:57,840
It was alright enough, and I did agree with the sentiment I'd personally take cocktails

30
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,040
over beer any day, either way, I didn't really think too much about it, my life had

31
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,280
very little to do with YouTube back then.

32
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:09,540
However, that man in the video was GradeAUnderA, or Grade for short, he is a commentator with

33
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:13,600
a very distinct style, and I'll talk about the styles that he was inspired by in a bit,

34
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,680
but as you can see from that clip, it bathes in the rather amateurish charm.

35
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,260
Currently Grade sits on just shy of 3 and a half million subscribers, and is very prolific

36
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:26,980
in the commentary community for both positive and not so positive reasons, but I didn't

37
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,980
know that back then, I was just another pleb.

38
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:33,900
Fast forward a couple years, and I was much more engaged in the commentary community,

39
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:37,980
all this drama with Leafy was transpiring, I wasn't really an avid viewer of him, but

40
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:42,080
I was thoroughly involved in the whole feud with Keemstar, and I remember really rallying

41
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:47,260
behind Leafy, I think I even sent him an email in support, which was incredibly sad, not

42
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:51,380
just the sentiment of it, but the fact that I used email, I'm like Benjamin Button because

43
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:55,140
I used to be a boomer, and now I'm an epic, woke man.

44
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:59,960
And then iDubbbz's content cop dropped, and I had my perception completely 180'd, everything

45
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:04,300
I thought was true was not, and iDubbbz did a decent job at destroying Leafy, who then

46
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:08,700
managed to destroy himself with his own response video, proving he was well out of his depth,

47
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,180
but that my friends is a story for another time.

48
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:14,860
Grade was dragged into all of this because he'd made videos on the situation, and jumped

49
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:19,140
on the Keemstar hate train, in fact he'd been quite involved in the drama, until the

50
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:23,800
content cop in which he kinda just slid out the back door, I wonder why, and after a few

51
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:28,300
more months of videos, he was gone, he was just kinda moved on, there were a few thought

52
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:33,080
pieces asking where he'd gone, how he'd fallen from grace, how he'd lost his groove

53
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:39,680
and so on, everyone kinda knew he'd return, and at the turn of 2019, he did, for a bit.

54
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,300
How long he'll be around, I don't know, honestly, he's probably left already, but

55
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:48,260
at the same time, his return did complete an arc that I felt necessary to make this

56
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,300
video.

57
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:53,300
I always felt there was more to his story, because my two experiences with his content

58
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:57,740
were radically different, covering themes that could have been related to a different

59
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:58,740
channel.

60
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:02,740
My perception going into this is that of a person who became something else than he initially

61
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:07,900
set out to be, from that person on my Facebook feed, it never felt like he was setting himself

62
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,860
up to become another channel caught up in the drama.

63
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:14,920
So today, and probably next week as well, if you're not familiar with the tale of

64
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:19,240
Grade A Under Ray, I want this to be a learning experience, not just for you, but also for

65
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,240
me.

66
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:23,000
We're going to understand his rise, his peak, and even his fall, but we're not just

67
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,600
going to be documenting how it happened, we'll be asking why it happened, and maybe providing

68
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,160
some opinions on the whole situation along the way, let's just hope they're the right

69
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,160
ones.

70
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,160
Are you ready?

71
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,160
Good.

72
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,160
Let's go.

73
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:47,080
Grade A Under Ray started his channel in January 2013, back in the days before any

74
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,760
real commentary community was particularly well defined.

75
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:53,980
At the time, a lot of the largest creators were comedians, a lot of these were skits

76
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:58,500
and sketches, people like Nigahiga, Steve Cardinal, you know that guy who did songs

77
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:02,080
in real life and chat roulette versions of songs that would probably have been copyright

78
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:08,120
claimed as shit, Jenna Marbles, Bad Lip Reading, Smosh, Rhett and Link, and plenty plenty more.

79
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:12,240
The quality was in the individual's videos, and the value held within them rather than

80
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,240
just the channel.

81
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:16,940
That's not to say these people didn't have a personality, they did, but it was challenged

82
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:21,380
more into constructing a persona for certain purposes rather than necessarily feeling the

83
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:22,720
authentic connection.

84
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,720
There was rumblings of some commentary in the form of political content, but not everyone

85
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,960
was really looking for that.

86
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:31,900
In fact, if you wanted a connection to a creator on a more personal level, then you'd have

87
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:36,660
to look towards the gaming content, and I'm not saying that gaming content typically

88
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:41,580
had people learning that much about the person, but at the end of it all a lot of gaming YouTubers

89
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:46,380
did tend to be pretty genuine in their reactions, and that led to a lot of diversity in the

90
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:47,420
actual delivery.

91
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:51,840
I discussed it briefly in my Toby Turner video, back then if you had something going on upstairs

92
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,420
you could sit down and play a game and there would be an audience if you were competent

93
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:59,300
enough, and that's why you would likely find a lot of modern commentary audiences

94
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,540
probably watch gaming videos at one point.

95
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:04,620
I know I did, do I sound like a huge epic gamer?

96
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:05,620
No?

97
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:06,620
Well, I am.

98
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:07,620
Bitches.

99
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:12,320
commentary wasn't really going to emerge until 2015, and yet great is a very interesting

100
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,260
case because he emerged before that.

101
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:15,700
How exactly did he do that?

102
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:21,360
Well, the only real genre that had established itself at the time with a firm basis in opinions

103
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:26,340
was the film and music criticism genre, and that still had a long way to go, but by 2013

104
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:30,440
there was a fairly nice assortment of critics in these circles, and I wanted to take this

105
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:35,200
and then apply it to someone who I know as a dose of Buckley, and what he did was typically

106
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:39,680
a mix of criticism, but also commentary, with a comedic stinging tone to it.

107
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,820
He always described himself as a comedian primarily, and I do have a lot to say about

108
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:48,160
him as well, but you can definitely see where these various roots were in Grey's content.

109
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,800
Grey was a real mix of comedy, commentary, but also one more component, which was story,

110
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,280
and I've spoken about storytime animators before, but there is a distinct similarity

111
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:02,000
in Grey's early content to many of the animators that we see nowadays.

112
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,520
Storytime animators typically run a structure where they speak with a narrative, they set

113
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,960
the scene, and then they re-enact the scene, typically in a comedic way that entertains

114
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:10,960
the audience.

115
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:15,020
However, with all that said, Grey still had to convince his viewers that his content was

116
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:18,520
worth watching, and that means not being absolute crap.

117
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:21,600
Grey Day Under Ray were the two characters that represented him.

118
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:26,040
On one side you have the Grey Day, the smart successful side, and on the other side is

119
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:31,160
the under-ray, the underachiever, the scruffy lazy character, and he wanted to present

120
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,320
both of these sides in his channel.

121
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:37,960
When watching Grey's first video, 9 Things I Hate About The Barber Shop, this style becomes

122
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:38,960
quite clear.

123
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,760
He talks about what he doesn't like, and then he'll provide a demonstration.

124
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:46,080
However, whereas with animators some of the appeal comes to balance between the style

125
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,720
and the persona, Grey tends to discard elaborate visuals for an extremely simple style, thus

126
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,200
focusing a majority of the draw on his own delivery.

127
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,560
And although this video didn't initially grab traction like the videos we'll talk

128
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:01,280
about soon, we can actually witness some very successful comedy.

129
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,500
It's simple, to the point, and over the top.

130
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:08,640
In many ways, Grey's channel was an amalgamation of various genres that were currently prevailing.

131
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:13,360
He was a comedian, but he was also a storyteller who was conveying his own personal experiences,

132
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,520
albeit in an exaggerated manner, tapping into the relatable frustrations of the daily life,

133
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:21,520
and applying a little bit of attitude to give him the edge.

134
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,320
Plenty of people had the exact same thoughts about him.

135
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:28,640
For example, everyone goes to school, what makes Grey's experiences or thoughts on

136
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,640
it remotely exceptional?

137
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:34,320
Well, it's the energy he brings, and the fact that people like hearing him talk about

138
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,320
it.

139
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,320
And that's a genuine talent.

140
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,320
Here's a clip from his first upload.

141
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,520
And my hair went from amazing to shit.

142
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,520
How did you do that?

143
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,520
I'm more impressed than anything.

144
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,520
Number four.

145
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:06,520
And after he's ruined your hair, he has the nerve to look you in the eye, and ask you,

146
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,520
what do you think, mate?

147
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,520
And you tell him it looks good.

148
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,520
Every time.

149
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,520
Number five.

150
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,520
And then you pay him for it.

151
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,520
And you pay him for fucking your hair up.

152
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,520
Why did I do that?

153
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,520
I should have told you no.

154
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,520
You're not getting my money.

155
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,520
You cunt.

156
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,520
Look what you've done.

157
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,520
Give me a wig.

158
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:27,520
A lot of the best comedy comes down to rhetoric.

159
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:30,520
Anyone can think of a funny punchline or a decent joke here and there, but what makes

160
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:34,520
the greatest comedians great is the fact that they can take a story and they can tell it

161
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,520
in a funny way.

162
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,520
How does Grey do that?

163
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,520
Part of it is the articulation.

164
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:42,520
Grey does a great technique of expression, his skewed accent does help in a way, but

165
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,520
here what you're doing is he's setting up a story.

166
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,520
Let me set the scene.

167
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,520
We're at slide four now.

168
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:49,520
We've known the slides before, he's shown a few examples.

169
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,520
And then for slide four, he changes the style.

170
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:56,520
He provides the setup and he's really satisfied with his haircut and he conveys that with

171
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,520
his tone.

172
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,520
And about halfway through, it starts to look good.

173
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:02,520
It starts to look really, really nice.

174
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:05,520
And it builds to the payoff because he sounds proper pleased, but we all know he's going

175
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:08,520
to lose his shit and we're anticipating it.

176
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,520
And then he snaps.

177
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,520
But by the end of it, it looks dog shit.

178
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,520
What did you do?

179
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,520
I blinked.

180
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,520
I blinked to me.

181
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:18,520
And my hair went from amazing to shit.

182
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,520
How did you do that?

183
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,520
I'm more impressed than anything.

184
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:25,520
And he does a good job of providing the viewers with that sense of comedic catharsis.

185
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:30,520
And if you can build up to something and set up some sentiment of nerve in that audience,

186
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,520
then you'll make the payoff funnier.

187
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:37,520
Comedy is not just about contrast, but it's about audience investment in that contrast.

188
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:41,520
The other thing I find interesting is he leaves these pauses in the buildup, which leave the

189
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:45,520
sort of dead air with the audience, which, you know, if I did it in my videos,

190
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,520
it wouldn't make sense.

191
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:52,520
But in his works, it plays off the tension, like that in a horror movie.

192
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:56,520
Tension makes the scares scarier, just as it makes the jokes funnier.

193
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,520
But that's not all at play here.

194
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:03,520
I recall a very good video by The Nerd Writer, which spoke about Louis CK's tant at the delivery of jokes.

195
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:06,520
And one of the overarching themes is that no word is wasted.

196
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:11,520
And that's something I'd describe as perfectly prevalent in great early comedy.

197
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:16,520
And about halfway through, it starts to look good. It starts to look really, really nice.

198
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,520
But by the end of it, it looks dogshit.

199
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:23,520
What did you do? I blinked. I blinked to make.

200
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,520
And not a single one is wasted.

201
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:30,520
They're used either in meaning or in rhythm to contribute to the overall effect,

202
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:35,520
an effect that lets us see the world from a different angle and, more importantly, makes us laugh.

203
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:39,520
It's those details which add value to great work, makes it more entertaining

204
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:42,520
and does give him an edge over the contemporaries at the time.

205
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:46,520
Combine that with the rather cheap and simple style, which doesn't distract from his delivery

206
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:49,520
and can often add a snark visual gag or so.

207
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:53,520
It's simple but effective, and I want to make this point that no one reaches the size of Grey

208
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,520
without some kind of unique feature.

209
00:11:55,520 --> 00:12:00,520
Grey's initial appeal was a mix of features, which crafted this very distinctive persona.

210
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:04,520
And although I'm sure many of his critics and advocates would argue whether he's actually funny,

211
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:07,520
it's hard to dispute that he was successful.

212
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,520
And success has its reasons.

213
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:13,520
But as many will say, success isn't just about being good at what you're doing,

214
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,520
you have to be good at selling it as well.

215
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:19,520
And this is where we go into the very weird second stage of Grey's career.

216
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:27,520
Grey's second video was uploaded in April 2013 and was called

217
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:32,520
Girlie Drinks vs Manly Drinks, a now infamous video in which Grey rants about how social norms

218
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:37,520
pressure him to avoid consuming drinks that taste nice and push him towards drinks like beer and bitter

219
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,520
which affirm his status as a man.

220
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:44,520
It's hyperbolic and ridiculous, but it's ironically decent social comedy with a good dash of humour.

221
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:47,520
And so he released this video, and it didn't do much at all.

222
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:51,520
Actually, it was his second video. YouTube hadn't really paid much attention to his channel.

223
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,520
They're probably pushing the newest Rihanna song or something.

224
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,520
What was Rihanna doing in 2013?

225
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:59,520
Stay? God, do I feel old.

226
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:03,520
So there is this site called Reddit, I don't know if any of you have heard of it,

227
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:07,520
but for anyone who genuinely doesn't follow it, it's basically a site that serves as a collective of forums

228
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:11,520
or what they call subreddits for people to find others who might share interests

229
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,520
and then to post in them and maybe comment on them.

230
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:17,520
And this can be basically anything at all, within the guidelines of course,

231
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,520
from homosexuality to mean girls.

232
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:22,520
And I'm really not a regular of Reddit, but I know that much.

233
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:26,520
Subreddit that is the focus of this part is r slash videos,

234
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:29,520
which is a forum where people can post content that they like.

235
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:32,520
It is a fairly well organised subreddit with users galore,

236
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,520
and various tabs that can basically arrange the post how you would like them.

237
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:40,520
However, the very important tab here is obviously what was called in 2014 the hot tab.

238
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:44,520
Now, Gray's video isn't doing too much, it had been a year and a half since release,

239
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:50,520
and yet a user by the quaint name of Bonerboy, lovely, posted his video to the r slash videos subreddit

240
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,520
with the title as the caption.

241
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:55,520
Now unfortunately, I do not have a screenshot of it doing the rounds

242
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,520
because there weren't any that I could find,

243
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:00,520
but there is one of the post itself very briefly after it was posted,

244
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:03,520
and you can see that it quickly picked up steam,

245
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:07,520
receiving appraisal from many of the users who enjoyed his crude style in reading the comments.

246
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:11,520
It hearkens back to my earlier comparisons with regards to animators too,

247
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:15,520
with many people suggesting that content would have fit very aptly into the Newgrounds site,

248
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:18,520
a website renowned for the animators it hosted.

249
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,520
And that's what this video hit home with.

250
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:24,520
Gray seemed like a throwback creator with a twist thrown in, and the masses had spoken.

251
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:27,520
They decided that this is the content they wanted, but Gray was gone.

252
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:31,520
He had legitimately forgot he even made a YouTube account.

253
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,520
I mean, hell, he didn't even have an avatar.

254
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,520
The under-a side was clearly taking over.

255
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:39,520
In fact, Gray was on Facebook when he saw his video being shared,

256
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:42,520
and realised that suddenly he had an audience, and an audience to answer to,

257
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:46,520
and as acknowledged in a tweet he'd make a year later, it kicked his channel off.

258
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:49,520
So if Bonerboy hadn't made that post on that Reddit,

259
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:52,520
Gray probably would have never uploaded another YouTube video.

260
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,520
And yet, here we are.

261
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:58,520
With the success of his content, Gray made a video committing to more uploads,

262
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:03,520
and unlike 90% of the creators who commit to more uploads before disappearing off the face of the Earth,

263
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:06,520
he actually stayed true to his word, for now.

264
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,520
And we witness some spicy content.

265
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:11,520
His video following this was known as the Paralympics,

266
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:14,520
and this is where Gray begins to really cement that persona.

267
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,520
I've spoken about how his content can be funny,

268
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:19,520
but being good and being popular are not the same,

269
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:24,520
and having mass appeal can often mean you might sacrifice niche qualities that you may take preference to.

270
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,520
But Gray was very consistent.

271
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:29,520
He took a perspective of great ignorance.

272
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,520
Now that might sound like a criticism,

273
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:36,520
it would be if I went to Gray's channel looking for insightful commentary or some bold truth teller,

274
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:39,520
but you don't, you go for crude jokes from a judgemental twat,

275
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:42,520
and the thing about ignorance is that for many people, it is relatable.

276
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:46,520
Most people don't know much about a lot, doesn't mean they're stupid,

277
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:51,520
some people have a few subjects in which they specialize in due to career reasons or specific interests,

278
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,520
but ignorance is relatable in a way,

279
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:56,520
and so you have videos that may not be completely accurate,

280
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:59,520
but you get the impression that they're quite aware they're not,

281
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:02,520
because he's putting on a stupid voice, he's allowed to be stupid,

282
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:07,520
but at the same time, he's playing with the cynical, judgemental thoughts that cross many people's minds,

283
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,520
like do horse jockeys even do anything?

284
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,520
Surely it's the horse that needs to be disabled.

285
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:14,520
The dumbest thing on earth.

286
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:17,520
Paralympic horse riding.

287
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:22,520
The reason it's so dumb is that it's not the horse that has to be disabled,

288
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:25,520
it's the rider.

289
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:29,520
You don't do anything rider, you just sit there.

290
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:35,520
So for example these two fine chaps, they can't be in the Paralympics,

291
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:40,520
but this Lloyd's TSB majestic stallion could,

292
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:45,520
because his rider's missing a finger or an eyebrow or something.

293
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:49,520
Now I'm sure with a bit of research you'd find out otherwise, but people don't care.

294
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:53,520
It's easier to think about it simply and get a laugh out of someone's rants.

295
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:56,520
He's the comedian who says the stupid stuff and gets the laugh,

296
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:59,520
because it's somewhat based in the assumptions that people make themselves.

297
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,520
It is relatable in its ignorance.

298
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:05,520
During the last few months of 2014, in the wake of his son's success,

299
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,520
Grade would upload multiple videos in the same format,

300
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,520
just talking about stuff in this style.

301
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:14,520
This would cement him as a creator and lead to significant and consistent growth

302
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,520
throughout the coming few months.

303
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:20,520
He would rant about Tinder, toilets, interviews, basically anything that bothered him.

304
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:23,520
He'd become more and more creative with these gags,

305
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:28,520
make longer content but still hold on to many of the rather simplistic aspects of his videos,

306
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,520
balancing that feeling of progression.

307
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:35,520
With the notion of familiarity, like upgrading a car rather than purchasing a new model.

308
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:39,520
You still need to make people feel like they're watching a Grade A under A video.

309
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,520
When the video that we're discussing today came around,

310
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:45,520
Ray was sat on a respectable 29,000 subscribers.

311
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:49,520
His growth had been solid and steady with occasional spikes aided by the algorithm.

312
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,520
His videos typically surpassed his subscriber count

313
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:55,520
and he was being aided by various supports on other websites.

314
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,520
Obviously I mentioned my encounter with a Facebook post.

315
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,520
However, we're entering 2015.

316
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,520
And you know what that means?

317
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,520
Well, the start of a little genre called commentary,

318
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,520
believe you who is someone I'm sure we'll talk about eventually,

319
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:10,520
sat mid-February on around 23,000 subscribers.

320
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:14,520
Fairly respectable, that's only because most of them came from a Minecraft PVP channel.

321
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:18,520
However, under a month later, Grade would get his first taste of drama

322
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,520
with someone known as Ray William Johnson.

323
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:24,520
Ray William Johnson was one of the largest creators on the platform

324
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,520
and although he wasn't anywhere near his peak at this time,

325
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,520
he was still pulling respectable numbers on his videos,

326
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:34,520
the sort of numbers that I would dream about getting on a constant basis.

327
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:38,520
He had a lot of successful ventures, so calling him out was a pretty big deal

328
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:41,520
because you're going to be dealing with his still sizable fanbase,

329
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,520
this guy on over 10 million subscribers.

330
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,520
So, what happened?

331
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,520
I'm late all the time.

332
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:52,520
I am probably gonna be late for work every day.

333
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,520
So tell me about a weakness of yours.

334
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,520
Oh my god, where to start?

335
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:03,520
What would you say is your greatest weakness?

336
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,520
Where do I start? Uhh...

337
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,520
Right, where do you see yourself in five years' time?

338
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:13,520
Hopefully, not still in this shithole.

339
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,520
Where do you see yourself in five years?

340
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,520
Not in this shithole.

341
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,520
Well, shit.

342
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:32,520
To understand the situation, we go back to the video before it,

343
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:36,520
Why I Hate Interviews, in which Grey goes on one of his typical rants

344
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:39,520
interspersed with his comedy that we've previously discussed.

345
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,520
At some point in this video, he mocks up an interview

346
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,520
and responds to it in a fairly candid fashion.

347
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:47,520
Eleven days later, Ray William Johnson uploads the video

348
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:51,520
How To Ace Job Interviews, a sarcastic title for a run of sketches

349
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,520
in which the applicant provides the worst answers possible.

350
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,520
However, some of these responses, more specifically,

351
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:59,520
three of them had a strange resemblance to Grey's answers.

352
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,520
And you know what?

353
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,520
That's certainly not something to be ignored,

354
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:05,520
especially when it's one of the site's largest creators,

355
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,520
stealing from a significantly smaller creator.

356
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,520
But what's Grey gonna do about it?

357
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:13,520
Now we're in March 2015, commentaries hasn't merged yet,

358
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,520
but we're definitely in the rumblings of it.

359
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,520
And I want to talk about drama for a brief moment for that reason.

360
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,520
Drama always existed,

361
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:23,520
especially when you're dealing with genres that involve personalities

362
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,520
rather than just personas, which is why the gaming community,

363
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:29,520
in spite of their relatively avoidant attitude to drama,

364
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,520
did have their incidents.

365
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,520
Commentary in the last few years, however, has taken over the drama scene,

366
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,520
because for many commentators, it is highly beneficial for their channel

367
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,520
that they talk about drama.

368
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,520
And it's like the media when they report an incident.

369
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:43,520
Often it's not just the drama itself that guards the attention,

370
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,520
but the people who actually cover it.

371
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:49,520
You're always looking for the hot take from that one person you want to hear talk.

372
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:53,520
With that said, Grey didn't have the same approach that many commentators do today.

373
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,520
If I felt someone had ripped me off, unfortunately I wouldn't be able to turn around

374
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:59,520
and make a 30 minute video, as fun as it might be.

375
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,520
In fact, many commentators wouldn't want to make a video on someone

376
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:06,520
who might have copied their joke, because it would be seen as petty or going overboard.

377
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,520
This is where we bring in Grey's style.

378
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:11,520
Grey's comedy was found with him being excessive.

379
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,520
His videos could also be very short and not really have much meaning.

380
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:17,520
So he made this video questioning whether Grey had quote, plagiarised him.

381
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,520
He opened with the corresponding clips in question, before doing this.

382
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:56,520
Now this isn't the last time he would use this demeanor.

383
00:21:56,520 --> 00:22:01,520
What he's doing is he's using comedy as a masquerade to push quite genuine accusations.

384
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:06,520
Grey's videos felt tongue-in-cheek enough to not necessarily take seriously in their tone,

385
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:09,520
they were too self-aware and comedic to frame him negatively,

386
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:13,520
but their arguments too well presented to completely ignore in their points.

387
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,520
If we're speaking formally, you can't really prove that Grey was plagiarising,

388
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:19,520
because as concepts, they're a bit too general to be claimed,

389
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:22,520
but it is very plausible that Grey did take the jokes.

390
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:25,520
It does seem a bit too similar to be a coincidence.

391
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:30,520
Grey's video on this quickly gained traction and hit over 200,000 views in a few days.

392
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:33,520
I mean, calling anyone out is always good for a quick rush of views,

393
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,520
and although at first it wasn't universally well received,

394
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:40,520
you can see the like-dislike ratio is still strongly in his favour.

395
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:43,520
Compare this to a recent drama, for example Coffee Break's video,

396
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,520
which I do plan on discussing in the future,

397
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,520
because he mainly framed his problems very seriously,

398
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:51,520
many people have now responded and began to call him petty,

399
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,520
which has affected many people's feeling about the whole drama.

400
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,520
As Grey goes, he's done pretty well.

401
00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:00,520
This was his first taste of drama, but not really much came beyond of it.

402
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:03,520
There was an article written on the Daily Dots and a bit of buzz at the time,

403
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,520
but Johnson never really responded.

404
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,520
Because Grey was such a small YouTuber at the time,

405
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,520
he would have been punching down fairly hard,

406
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:13,520
and he probably didn't want to strengthen it unless he had a concrete response,

407
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,520
which would have been hard.

408
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:17,520
So life went on, Grey did alright from the situation,

409
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,520
and decided to go back to the sort of content that people at that time knew him for.

410
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,520
However, this was about to change again,

411
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:27,520
because now we're in June, and a little-known YouTuber by the name of Leafy

412
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,520
was beginning to gather significant momentum.

413
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:33,520
Grey, in a similar position, decided once again to make a different kind of video,

414
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:38,520
this time calling out a YouTuber by the name of Richard Burgess, aka Vegan Gains.

415
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:43,520
Basically, a blatant bait video, because Vegan Gains was known to respond to everyone.

416
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:46,520
His video alleged that Vegan Gains was fairly dishonest in his content,

417
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:49,520
unbelievably biased towards anyone on a vegan diet,

418
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:54,520
and promotes a lot of misinformation that people should definitely take with a grain of salt.

419
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:57,520
However, at the end of the video, Grey takes a slightly different approach.

420
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,520
You damn good as well.

421
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,520
But the ones now, they're just garbage.

422
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:04,520
Now hopefully, I don't have to make any more videos about you.

423
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:08,520
I've already made two other videos that are ready to be uploaded in like a second's notice, right?

424
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:13,520
One of the videos that I have is one of his worst of the YouTube fitness industry videos

425
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,520
that I stole when I hacked into Vegan Gains' computer.

426
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,520
Because I'm a hacker, me, right?

427
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:21,520
And it's one he didn't upload for very good reason.

428
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,520
It's not one he would want you seeing, trust me.

429
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,520
And as if that wasn't saucy enough,

430
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:31,520
the other video that I've got is a personal video message to Vegan Gains

431
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,520
from a very fucking surprising source.

432
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,520
Now this is where Grey's very ambiguous tone comes into play.

433
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,520
It's quite clear that he isn't a hacker,

434
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:44,520
but it's still possible that he's managed to get his hands onto some sort of incriminating file.

435
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,520
Vegan Gains is a volatile character,

436
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:52,520
and it's not impossible to suggest that maybe there are a few deleted videos of him floating around the web

437
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,520
that have him doing some pretty strong things.

438
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,520
Grey presents him with the quote,

439
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,520
Ultimatum.

440
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:01,520
Responder is going to make another video where he uploads everything.

441
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,520
Listen, this is just me being a bit of an idiot, right?

442
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,520
This is just playful banter, yeah?

443
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:08,520
But listen, Vegan Gains, if you don't reply to this video and explain yourself

444
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:12,520
and address all the points I've brought up in this video and explain your lies, right?

445
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:16,520
I will take it as a personal insult, and I will post both of them, right?

446
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,520
Man, listen, I like you, mate.

447
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:22,520
You're a bit annoying here and there, but overall, I do like you, mate.

448
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:25,520
Don't make me post those videos, man.

449
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,520
So Vegan Gains decided to respond by, well, not responding.

450
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,520
This clearly caught Grey off,

451
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:33,520
because Vegan Gains was renowned for going after people,

452
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,520
and yet like Donald Trump not responding to Eminem,

453
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:39,520
the one time where you'd expect him to respond, he didn't.

454
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,520
So when Vegan Gains didn't respond,

455
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:46,520
Grey uploaded the update video that threatened to release the three very important unseen videos,

456
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,520
providing a specific due date,

457
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:51,520
that being Saturday the 4th of July 2015.

458
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:55,520
Once again, having this sort of due date makes Grey seem more serious

459
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:59,520
and presents this to Vegan Gains to encourage that response.

460
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:03,520
He hypes it up and says we all need to tweet it at the Vegan Gains nemeses,

461
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,520
and obtain their attention.

462
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,520
Everyone's on the edge of his seats. What's Grey going to reveal?

463
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:11,520
Well, not much. In fact, Grey was just bluffing.

464
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:15,520
The third video was released, and the alleged clips were presented were not as expected.

465
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,520
If you expected anything at all, that is.

466
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:23,520
One of them was a cut-up compilation where you know the one where you remix someone's speech to change the message.

467
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:27,520
The second video, a special message from someone, was another meme,

468
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:32,520
and the rest of the video was spent going through Vegan Gains' old channel and just digging up various comments.

469
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:36,520
From one perspective, it could be seen as rather desperate from Grey,

470
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:39,520
to basically threaten someone into giving you their attention.

471
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,520
And he makes it no secret, that's kind of what he was trying to do.

472
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:47,520
Okay, now listen, if I'm honest, I said that if Vegan Gains didn't reply to my previous video,

473
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,520
that I would then release these other two, right?

474
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:53,520
Which was a complete lie, like regardless of what he did, I was still going to upload him, right?

475
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,520
And yet, coming out of it, he received very little criticism,

476
00:26:56,520 --> 00:27:00,520
and appeared with a big W to his name. Why is that?

477
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:03,520
Well, firstly, Vegan Gains isn't really popular,

478
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,520
and people can't really feel bad for him,

479
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,520
regardless of whether he was right or not to respond.

480
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:12,520
And a lot of Grey's criticisms in his first video were fairly valid.

481
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:16,520
But the second reason this little stunt worked was because of his persona, Grade-A Under-A.

482
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:19,520
In his comedy videos, you don't really see that contrast too much,

483
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:25,520
but in these more drama-oriented videos, on one hand you have the Grade-A side that can deliver criticism,

484
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:31,520
and yet the uneven delivery, and the messy tone, and the comedy falls towards the Under-A side.

485
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,520
And this meant that as long as he acknowledged his intentions,

486
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:37,520
with enough self-awareness, he'd typically receive a pass.

487
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:42,520
This is interesting because while he emerged in a time where comedy dominated YouTube,

488
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:46,520
clearly reflected in his style, we were entering a more dramatic phase.

489
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:50,520
The times were changing, and Grade had to change with them as well.

490
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:53,520
But to do that, we have to understand drama.

491
00:27:55,520 --> 00:28:08,520
The Thing About Drama

492
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,520
The thing about drama is that there are various routes you can take.

493
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:15,520
You can take the route of being the moralist, being the person who dictates how you should act,

494
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:20,520
down to the small details, what words you should and shouldn't use, etc.

495
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:25,520
If you want to deal criticism like that, you need to set an example of how to deal it.

496
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:30,520
On the other hand, you have people who don't give a shit about 90% of things when they're criticising others,

497
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:35,520
and although this might seem less pure in many of their characteristics, it makes them harder to criticise.

498
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:40,520
A great example of this is iDubbbz, another significant player later on in the story.

499
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:44,520
Some people may criticise him for his fairly nonchalant approach to the use of certain words,

500
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:47,520
as shown in the Tana Mongeau content copy made,

501
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:52,520
but he turns this around and says, well I don't think that defines my morality, so take it or leave it.

502
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:56,520
You can criticise him, but you can't really end him or cancel him,

503
00:28:56,520 --> 00:29:00,520
because what he did was proxy to a much greater point against the target,

504
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:04,520
and regardless of how much Twitter would like to paint it as a black and white issue,

505
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,520
you'll experience very different attitudes.

506
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:12,520
With Vegan Gains, Grade isn't necessarily behaving morally, in fact he comes across as a bit of a pest,

507
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:18,520
but he doesn't need to behave morally because he kind of acknowledges it and integrates it into his persona,

508
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:22,520
often acknowledging the fact that you're not perfect can humanise yourself in the eyes of your viewers,

509
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:25,520
while being able to deliver some sort of criticism.

510
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:31,520
In the instance of Vegan Gains, he is a liar, and being a liar is an easy criticism because it implies a logical falsehood.

511
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:36,520
It's typically rather simple, unless you can appeal to a greater good, like a white lie.

512
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:40,520
With the success of this drama, in spite of the disappointing lack of response,

513
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:44,520
Grade would begin to start doing these sorts of videos a bit more regularly,

514
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:48,520
and the thing is, I don't think a lot of people really notice much difference in the videos,

515
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:53,520
mainly because Grade had such a grip on his style, his character encompassed all those topics,

516
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,520
and he definitely takes this going forward.

517
00:29:55,520 --> 00:30:00,520
His next targets were Jinx and CJSoCool, two fairly unpopular reaction channels,

518
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:06,520
who were notorious for basically playing videos and reacting to them in a way that provided no level of transformation whatsoever.

519
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:11,520
Grade's video on them was a lot tighter in its points and used pretty affirmative evidence to convey his sentiments.

520
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:17,520
Now listen to this, right? It's like a 17 minute, 16 second video, right?

521
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:23,520
Of which, literally 45 seconds is not KSI's video.

522
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:28,520
So CJ's video is literally over 95% KSI, right?

523
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,520
Which is ridiculous!

524
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:34,520
Obviously they're gonna get popularity if they're stealing some of the biggest YouTuber's content, right?

525
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,520
That's so hard, isn't it?

526
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:40,520
Now what must have particularly pleased Grade in this situation was that Jinx actually responded,

527
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:43,520
and he responded with all the grace that you'd expect from a reaction channel.

528
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:50,520
Now first thing I wanna say before I even start going down this list is the fact that this guy hates me because I'm popular.

529
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,520
Because I'm YouTube popular.

530
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:55,520
That is the one reason that it all boils down to.

531
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:59,520
He can say he's not a hater, he can say all of that, but let's just be honest.

532
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:04,520
And when you make a well-formed call-out video, going after channels who clearly think they are much better than they are,

533
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,520
it feels good for the audience to be a part of that.

534
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:13,520
The main reason it felt so good for many of Grade's fans was because Grade had intertwined it very delicately with his comedy.

535
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:17,520
His comedy being rooted in that relatability of the judgemental nature.

536
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:22,520
We've all seen some very successful YouTubers and thought, what the hell do they do that's special?

537
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,520
They're rubbish.

538
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:30,520
Grade took these thoughts and turned them into videos and combined them with more concise points and evidence to convince people of his case.

539
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:35,520
So even when he was being fairly blunt, it felt natural because his persona allowed him to do that.

540
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:40,520
Reaction channels are basically like a place for you to watch a video with someone else.

541
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:44,520
What the fuck, mate? That's one of the stupidest things I've ever heard.

542
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:47,520
I might as well go out and buy a blow-up doll. It's less annoying than you.

543
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:52,520
A response from Jinx, even like that, trying to be as indirect as possible is more attention,

544
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:57,520
because someone's going to ask what the video is, someone's going to know, and they're going to redirect it.

545
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:01,520
Especially if you're going after a larger YouTuber, who is an idiot.

546
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:06,520
Jinx had no personality, so trying to show any sort of anger felt like arrogance,

547
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:09,520
because it could only be correlated with his size, not his persona.

548
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:15,520
Through this, however, Grade did create a fanbase that were involved in the more dramatic side of Grade's work.

549
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:18,520
And following this, he went after more easy targets.

550
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:23,520
Nicole Arbour, prank channels, Nicole Arbour again, prank channels again, prank channels again.

551
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:28,520
And although these videos were fairly decent in a lot of their criticism, with a fair amount of evidence,

552
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:33,520
when you spend so much time dishing out copious amounts of criticism in the sort of tone that Grade did,

553
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:38,520
it became inevitable that he was going to grow out a channel much more drama-oriented.

554
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:45,520
Now, looking back in retrospect, it becomes clear that a lot of his more story-time-oriented content has outperformed his drama videos.

555
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:51,520
However, at the same time, his drama videos were some of the most popular on the site in the moment.

556
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:55,520
This was mainly because commentary was emerging with the people we've already discussed,

557
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:58,520
entering the stage where people felt comfortable calling others out.

558
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:03,520
With the rise of three pretty pivotal channels, we could see the tone of criticism evolving.

559
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:09,520
I identify these three channels as H3, iDubbbz, and obviously our main man here, GradeAUnderA.

560
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:13,520
All of these channels became porchbearers in calling out who they deemed to be twats.

561
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:18,520
This then brought a secondary wave of channels who typically focused their content on other topics,

562
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:24,520
but would often drop by on commentary issues, such as I Hate Everything, Pyrocynical, Leafy Boogie, and so on.

563
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:30,520
It was something fun to involve yourself in, and on top of this, it created more attention to the topics that people were discussing.

564
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:38,520
This was catalysed by the numerous incidents at the turn of 2016, alongside the launch of iDubbbz's series, Content Cop,

565
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:45,520
which basically set commentary on fire, particularly the Jinx episode, which of course, almost led to the infamous boxing match.

566
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:50,520
Don't get it twisted, Grade was one of the first on the scene to make these sorts of videos,

567
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:56,520
with an already established audience that identified the style, and therefore benefited of this development greatly.

568
00:33:56,520 --> 00:34:00,520
Equally in a perverted way, the drama videos worked in the vein that his comedy videos did.

569
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:07,520
Judgemental twats and relatability, we have those feelings towards those creators, that's why he went after unpopular people,

570
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:13,520
because many people already hated them. When you're targeting other people, you have to be prepared to become a target,

571
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:19,520
and 2016 was a new year for many reasons, many reasons that we'll find out in the next video.

572
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:25,520
Because this script is going to be very long, and I've learned that it's probably not best to exhaust your audience to that extent,

573
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:28,520
though other videos definitely have had me trying.

574
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:38,520
So that was the video, I really hope you guys enjoyed it, I want to give a big shoutout to my editors,

575
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:43,520
who've once again done a fantastic, beautiful job, I love them very much.

576
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:51,520
Make sure you check them out. I also need to give a shoutout to my Patreons, the current Patreons listed on the screen right now,

577
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:59,520
and I also have to give special shoutouts to my $50 Patreons, Connor, Somehullerblue, and Evening Steel,

578
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:06,520
all the three of you, thank you so much, it does genuinely make a difference, especially with YouTube's slightly unpredictable behaviour recently.

579
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:13,520
$100 too, I have to give the mention to Brandon and Ryan, truly incredible people,

580
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:18,520
and eternally grateful for their support, thank you guys, it makes a big difference.

581
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:25,520
Otherwise, if you want to, you can hit me up on Twitter, Discord, I even check Facebook sometimes,

582
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:29,520
most of the platforms, and I do my best to be responsive.

583
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:32,520
Otherwise, I don't really have too much else to say, I hope you enjoyed the video,

584
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:36,520
we'd love to hear your thoughts in the comment section, opinions are always welcome.

585
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:40,520
Until then, I'm The Right Opinion, and I'll see you in the next one.

586
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,520
I'm doing you, if you can.

587
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:36,520
Thanks for watching!
