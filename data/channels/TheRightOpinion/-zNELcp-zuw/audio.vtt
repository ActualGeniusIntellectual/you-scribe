00:00.000 --> 00:01.000
Grade A under A.

00:01.000 --> 00:02.000
Grade A under A.

00:02.000 --> 00:03.000
Grade A under A.

00:03.000 --> 00:04.000
Grade A under A.

00:04.000 --> 00:05.000
Grade A under A.

00:05.000 --> 00:06.000
Grade A under A.

00:06.000 --> 00:09.800
So a lot of newcomers to the website who may stumble across Grade's channel, Grade A under

00:09.800 --> 00:13.000
A, may not even realize why Grade was so important in the first place.

00:30.000 --> 00:36.200
Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with

00:36.200 --> 00:39.760
too much free time, and today we talk about someone who I've had a lot of requests to

00:39.760 --> 00:44.500
cover but never really quite got around to, well, today, my friends, is the time I finally

00:44.500 --> 00:45.500
address it.

00:45.500 --> 00:49.560
Now, in keeping with the old routine, we'll begin this video with a nice little story,

00:49.560 --> 00:51.900
because I love a good story like anyone else.

00:51.900 --> 00:55.600
When I was growing up, I wasn't really the type of person who used Twitter, or any of

00:55.600 --> 00:57.560
the social media sites that I use today.

00:57.560 --> 01:01.400
I was at school, and back then the only app that was really considered fashionable was

01:01.400 --> 01:02.400
Facebook.

01:02.400 --> 01:06.580
Now this is before Facebook was taken over by mums and their minion memes, but just take

01:06.580 --> 01:11.080
my word, at some point Facebook was cool, I promise guys, please don't reject me.

01:11.080 --> 01:14.920
At the time, it was cool to follow ridiculous numbers of Facebook pages, and before they

01:14.920 --> 01:19.360
were taken over by cash farm sponsorships, they had the capacity to be pretty funny,

01:19.360 --> 01:20.960
to my juvenile brain at least.

01:20.960 --> 01:24.280
However, it was one day that I clicked on one of the videos, I highly doubt I could

01:24.280 --> 01:28.440
find it now, but I remember it being this page called Unilad, and it was this post,

01:28.440 --> 01:32.800
with this guy, and he had this really strange accent, talking about manly drinks versus

01:32.800 --> 01:51.240
girly drinks, basically mocking the gender stereotypes behind alcoholic beverages.

01:51.240 --> 01:54.040
And to be honest, I didn't really know what to think.

01:54.040 --> 01:57.840
It was alright enough, and I did agree with the sentiment I'd personally take cocktails

01:57.840 --> 02:02.040
over beer any day, either way, I didn't really think too much about it, my life had

02:02.040 --> 02:04.280
very little to do with YouTube back then.

02:04.280 --> 02:09.540
However, that man in the video was GradeAUnderA, or Grade for short, he is a commentator with

02:09.540 --> 02:13.600
a very distinct style, and I'll talk about the styles that he was inspired by in a bit,

02:13.600 --> 02:17.680
but as you can see from that clip, it bathes in the rather amateurish charm.

02:17.680 --> 02:22.260
Currently Grade sits on just shy of 3 and a half million subscribers, and is very prolific

02:22.260 --> 02:26.980
in the commentary community for both positive and not so positive reasons, but I didn't

02:26.980 --> 02:29.980
know that back then, I was just another pleb.

02:29.980 --> 02:33.900
Fast forward a couple years, and I was much more engaged in the commentary community,

02:33.900 --> 02:37.980
all this drama with Leafy was transpiring, I wasn't really an avid viewer of him, but

02:37.980 --> 02:42.080
I was thoroughly involved in the whole feud with Keemstar, and I remember really rallying

02:42.080 --> 02:47.260
behind Leafy, I think I even sent him an email in support, which was incredibly sad, not

02:47.260 --> 02:51.380
just the sentiment of it, but the fact that I used email, I'm like Benjamin Button because

02:51.420 --> 02:55.140
I used to be a boomer, and now I'm an epic, woke man.

02:55.140 --> 02:59.960
And then iDubbbz's content cop dropped, and I had my perception completely 180'd, everything

02:59.960 --> 03:04.300
I thought was true was not, and iDubbbz did a decent job at destroying Leafy, who then

03:04.300 --> 03:08.700
managed to destroy himself with his own response video, proving he was well out of his depth,

03:08.700 --> 03:11.180
but that my friends is a story for another time.

03:11.180 --> 03:14.860
Grade was dragged into all of this because he'd made videos on the situation, and jumped

03:14.860 --> 03:19.140
on the Keemstar hate train, in fact he'd been quite involved in the drama, until the

03:19.140 --> 03:23.800
content cop in which he kinda just slid out the back door, I wonder why, and after a few

03:23.800 --> 03:28.300
more months of videos, he was gone, he was just kinda moved on, there were a few thought

03:28.300 --> 03:33.080
pieces asking where he'd gone, how he'd fallen from grace, how he'd lost his groove

03:33.080 --> 03:39.680
and so on, everyone kinda knew he'd return, and at the turn of 2019, he did, for a bit.

03:39.680 --> 03:44.300
How long he'll be around, I don't know, honestly, he's probably left already, but

03:44.300 --> 03:48.260
at the same time, his return did complete an arc that I felt necessary to make this

03:48.300 --> 03:49.300
video.

03:49.300 --> 03:53.300
I always felt there was more to his story, because my two experiences with his content

03:53.300 --> 03:57.740
were radically different, covering themes that could have been related to a different

03:57.740 --> 03:58.740
channel.

03:58.740 --> 04:02.740
My perception going into this is that of a person who became something else than he initially

04:02.740 --> 04:07.900
set out to be, from that person on my Facebook feed, it never felt like he was setting himself

04:07.900 --> 04:10.860
up to become another channel caught up in the drama.

04:10.860 --> 04:14.920
So today, and probably next week as well, if you're not familiar with the tale of

04:14.920 --> 04:19.240
Grade A Under Ray, I want this to be a learning experience, not just for you, but also for

04:19.240 --> 04:20.240
me.

04:20.240 --> 04:23.000
We're going to understand his rise, his peak, and even his fall, but we're not just

04:23.000 --> 04:27.600
going to be documenting how it happened, we'll be asking why it happened, and maybe providing

04:27.600 --> 04:31.160
some opinions on the whole situation along the way, let's just hope they're the right

04:31.160 --> 04:32.160
ones.

04:32.160 --> 04:33.160
Are you ready?

04:33.160 --> 04:34.160
Good.

04:34.160 --> 04:35.160
Let's go.

04:35.160 --> 04:47.080
Grade A Under Ray started his channel in January 2013, back in the days before any

04:47.080 --> 04:49.760
real commentary community was particularly well defined.

04:49.760 --> 04:53.980
At the time, a lot of the largest creators were comedians, a lot of these were skits

04:53.980 --> 04:58.500
and sketches, people like Nigahiga, Steve Cardinal, you know that guy who did songs

04:58.500 --> 05:02.080
in real life and chat roulette versions of songs that would probably have been copyright

05:02.080 --> 05:08.120
claimed as shit, Jenna Marbles, Bad Lip Reading, Smosh, Rhett and Link, and plenty plenty more.

05:08.120 --> 05:12.240
The quality was in the individual's videos, and the value held within them rather than

05:12.240 --> 05:13.240
just the channel.

05:13.240 --> 05:16.940
That's not to say these people didn't have a personality, they did, but it was challenged

05:16.940 --> 05:21.380
more into constructing a persona for certain purposes rather than necessarily feeling the

05:21.380 --> 05:22.720
authentic connection.

05:22.720 --> 05:26.720
There was rumblings of some commentary in the form of political content, but not everyone

05:26.720 --> 05:27.960
was really looking for that.

05:27.960 --> 05:31.900
In fact, if you wanted a connection to a creator on a more personal level, then you'd have

05:31.900 --> 05:36.660
to look towards the gaming content, and I'm not saying that gaming content typically

05:36.660 --> 05:41.580
had people learning that much about the person, but at the end of it all a lot of gaming YouTubers

05:41.580 --> 05:46.380
did tend to be pretty genuine in their reactions, and that led to a lot of diversity in the

05:46.380 --> 05:47.420
actual delivery.

05:47.420 --> 05:51.840
I discussed it briefly in my Toby Turner video, back then if you had something going on upstairs

05:51.840 --> 05:55.420
you could sit down and play a game and there would be an audience if you were competent

05:55.420 --> 05:59.300
enough, and that's why you would likely find a lot of modern commentary audiences

05:59.300 --> 06:01.540
probably watch gaming videos at one point.

06:01.540 --> 06:04.620
I know I did, do I sound like a huge epic gamer?

06:04.620 --> 06:05.620
No?

06:05.620 --> 06:06.620
Well, I am.

06:06.620 --> 06:07.620
Bitches.

06:07.620 --> 06:12.320
commentary wasn't really going to emerge until 2015, and yet great is a very interesting

06:12.320 --> 06:14.260
case because he emerged before that.

06:14.260 --> 06:15.700
How exactly did he do that?

06:15.700 --> 06:21.360
Well, the only real genre that had established itself at the time with a firm basis in opinions

06:21.360 --> 06:26.340
was the film and music criticism genre, and that still had a long way to go, but by 2013

06:26.340 --> 06:30.440
there was a fairly nice assortment of critics in these circles, and I wanted to take this

06:30.440 --> 06:35.200
and then apply it to someone who I know as a dose of Buckley, and what he did was typically

06:35.200 --> 06:39.680
a mix of criticism, but also commentary, with a comedic stinging tone to it.

06:39.680 --> 06:43.820
He always described himself as a comedian primarily, and I do have a lot to say about

06:43.820 --> 06:48.160
him as well, but you can definitely see where these various roots were in Grey's content.

06:48.160 --> 06:52.800
Grey was a real mix of comedy, commentary, but also one more component, which was story,

06:52.800 --> 06:57.280
and I've spoken about storytime animators before, but there is a distinct similarity

06:57.280 --> 07:02.000
in Grey's early content to many of the animators that we see nowadays.

07:02.000 --> 07:05.520
Storytime animators typically run a structure where they speak with a narrative, they set

07:05.520 --> 07:09.960
the scene, and then they re-enact the scene, typically in a comedic way that entertains

07:09.960 --> 07:10.960
the audience.

07:10.960 --> 07:15.020
However, with all that said, Grey still had to convince his viewers that his content was

07:15.020 --> 07:18.520
worth watching, and that means not being absolute crap.

07:18.520 --> 07:21.600
Grey Day Under Ray were the two characters that represented him.

07:21.600 --> 07:26.040
On one side you have the Grey Day, the smart successful side, and on the other side is

07:26.040 --> 07:31.160
the under-ray, the underachiever, the scruffy lazy character, and he wanted to present

07:31.160 --> 07:33.320
both of these sides in his channel.

07:33.320 --> 07:37.960
When watching Grey's first video, 9 Things I Hate About The Barber Shop, this style becomes

07:37.960 --> 07:38.960
quite clear.

07:38.960 --> 07:41.760
He talks about what he doesn't like, and then he'll provide a demonstration.

07:41.760 --> 07:46.080
However, whereas with animators some of the appeal comes to balance between the style

07:46.080 --> 07:50.720
and the persona, Grey tends to discard elaborate visuals for an extremely simple style, thus

07:50.720 --> 07:54.200
focusing a majority of the draw on his own delivery.

07:54.200 --> 07:57.560
And although this video didn't initially grab traction like the videos we'll talk

07:57.560 --> 08:01.280
about soon, we can actually witness some very successful comedy.

08:01.280 --> 08:03.500
It's simple, to the point, and over the top.

08:03.500 --> 08:08.640
In many ways, Grey's channel was an amalgamation of various genres that were currently prevailing.

08:08.640 --> 08:13.360
He was a comedian, but he was also a storyteller who was conveying his own personal experiences,

08:13.360 --> 08:18.520
albeit in an exaggerated manner, tapping into the relatable frustrations of the daily life,

08:18.520 --> 08:21.520
and applying a little bit of attitude to give him the edge.

08:21.560 --> 08:24.320
Plenty of people had the exact same thoughts about him.

08:24.320 --> 08:28.640
For example, everyone goes to school, what makes Grey's experiences or thoughts on

08:28.640 --> 08:29.640
it remotely exceptional?

08:29.640 --> 08:34.320
Well, it's the energy he brings, and the fact that people like hearing him talk about

08:34.320 --> 08:35.320
it.

08:35.320 --> 08:36.320
And that's a genuine talent.

08:36.320 --> 08:38.320
Here's a clip from his first upload.

08:52.520 --> 08:55.520
And my hair went from amazing to shit.

08:55.520 --> 08:56.520
How did you do that?

08:56.520 --> 08:59.520
I'm more impressed than anything.

08:59.520 --> 09:00.520
Number four.

09:00.520 --> 09:06.520
And after he's ruined your hair, he has the nerve to look you in the eye, and ask you,

09:06.520 --> 09:08.520
what do you think, mate?

09:08.520 --> 09:10.520
And you tell him it looks good.

09:10.520 --> 09:12.520
Every time.

09:12.520 --> 09:14.520
Number five.

09:14.520 --> 09:16.520
And then you pay him for it.

09:16.520 --> 09:18.520
And you pay him for fucking your hair up.

09:18.520 --> 09:19.520
Why did I do that?

09:19.520 --> 09:20.520
I should have told you no.

09:20.520 --> 09:21.520
You're not getting my money.

09:21.520 --> 09:22.520
You cunt.

09:22.520 --> 09:23.520
Look what you've done.

09:23.520 --> 09:24.520
Give me a wig.

09:24.520 --> 09:27.520
A lot of the best comedy comes down to rhetoric.

09:27.520 --> 09:30.520
Anyone can think of a funny punchline or a decent joke here and there, but what makes

09:30.520 --> 09:34.520
the greatest comedians great is the fact that they can take a story and they can tell it

09:34.520 --> 09:35.520
in a funny way.

09:35.520 --> 09:36.520
How does Grey do that?

09:36.520 --> 09:38.520
Part of it is the articulation.

09:38.520 --> 09:42.520
Grey does a great technique of expression, his skewed accent does help in a way, but

09:42.520 --> 09:44.520
here what you're doing is he's setting up a story.

09:44.520 --> 09:45.520
Let me set the scene.

09:45.520 --> 09:46.520
We're at slide four now.

09:46.520 --> 09:49.520
We've known the slides before, he's shown a few examples.

09:49.520 --> 09:51.520
And then for slide four, he changes the style.

09:51.520 --> 09:56.520
He provides the setup and he's really satisfied with his haircut and he conveys that with

09:56.520 --> 09:57.520
his tone.

09:57.520 --> 09:59.520
And about halfway through, it starts to look good.

09:59.520 --> 10:02.520
It starts to look really, really nice.

10:02.520 --> 10:05.520
And it builds to the payoff because he sounds proper pleased, but we all know he's going

10:05.520 --> 10:08.520
to lose his shit and we're anticipating it.

10:08.520 --> 10:09.520
And then he snaps.

10:09.520 --> 10:11.520
But by the end of it, it looks dog shit.

10:11.520 --> 10:13.520
What did you do?

10:13.520 --> 10:14.520
I blinked.

10:14.520 --> 10:15.520
I blinked to me.

10:15.520 --> 10:18.520
And my hair went from amazing to shit.

10:18.520 --> 10:19.520
How did you do that?

10:19.520 --> 10:21.520
I'm more impressed than anything.

10:21.520 --> 10:25.520
And he does a good job of providing the viewers with that sense of comedic catharsis.

10:25.520 --> 10:30.520
And if you can build up to something and set up some sentiment of nerve in that audience,

10:30.520 --> 10:32.520
then you'll make the payoff funnier.

10:32.520 --> 10:37.520
Comedy is not just about contrast, but it's about audience investment in that contrast.

10:37.520 --> 10:41.520
The other thing I find interesting is he leaves these pauses in the buildup, which leave the

10:41.520 --> 10:45.520
sort of dead air with the audience, which, you know, if I did it in my videos,

10:46.520 --> 10:48.520
it wouldn't make sense.

10:48.520 --> 10:52.520
But in his works, it plays off the tension, like that in a horror movie.

10:52.520 --> 10:56.520
Tension makes the scares scarier, just as it makes the jokes funnier.

10:56.520 --> 10:57.520
But that's not all at play here.

10:57.520 --> 11:03.520
I recall a very good video by The Nerd Writer, which spoke about Louis CK's tant at the delivery of jokes.

11:03.520 --> 11:06.520
And one of the overarching themes is that no word is wasted.

11:06.520 --> 11:11.520
And that's something I'd describe as perfectly prevalent in great early comedy.

11:11.520 --> 11:16.520
And about halfway through, it starts to look good. It starts to look really, really nice.

11:17.520 --> 11:19.520
But by the end of it, it looks dogshit.

11:19.520 --> 11:23.520
What did you do? I blinked. I blinked to make.

11:23.520 --> 11:25.520
And not a single one is wasted.

11:25.520 --> 11:30.520
They're used either in meaning or in rhythm to contribute to the overall effect,

11:30.520 --> 11:35.520
an effect that lets us see the world from a different angle and, more importantly, makes us laugh.

11:35.520 --> 11:39.520
It's those details which add value to great work, makes it more entertaining

11:39.520 --> 11:42.520
and does give him an edge over the contemporaries at the time.

11:42.520 --> 11:46.520
Combine that with the rather cheap and simple style, which doesn't distract from his delivery

11:46.520 --> 11:49.520
and can often add a snark visual gag or so.

11:49.520 --> 11:53.520
It's simple but effective, and I want to make this point that no one reaches the size of Grey

11:53.520 --> 11:55.520
without some kind of unique feature.

11:55.520 --> 12:00.520
Grey's initial appeal was a mix of features, which crafted this very distinctive persona.

12:00.520 --> 12:04.520
And although I'm sure many of his critics and advocates would argue whether he's actually funny,

12:04.520 --> 12:07.520
it's hard to dispute that he was successful.

12:07.520 --> 12:09.520
And success has its reasons.

12:09.520 --> 12:13.520
But as many will say, success isn't just about being good at what you're doing,

12:13.520 --> 12:15.520
you have to be good at selling it as well.

12:15.520 --> 12:19.520
And this is where we go into the very weird second stage of Grey's career.

12:22.520 --> 12:27.520
Grey's second video was uploaded in April 2013 and was called

12:27.520 --> 12:32.520
Girlie Drinks vs Manly Drinks, a now infamous video in which Grey rants about how social norms

12:32.520 --> 12:37.520
pressure him to avoid consuming drinks that taste nice and push him towards drinks like beer and bitter

12:37.520 --> 12:39.520
which affirm his status as a man.

12:39.520 --> 12:44.520
It's hyperbolic and ridiculous, but it's ironically decent social comedy with a good dash of humour.

12:44.520 --> 12:47.520
And so he released this video, and it didn't do much at all.

12:47.520 --> 12:51.520
Actually, it was his second video. YouTube hadn't really paid much attention to his channel.

12:51.520 --> 12:54.520
They're probably pushing the newest Rihanna song or something.

12:54.520 --> 12:56.520
What was Rihanna doing in 2013?

12:56.520 --> 12:59.520
Stay? God, do I feel old.

12:59.520 --> 13:03.520
So there is this site called Reddit, I don't know if any of you have heard of it,

13:03.520 --> 13:07.520
but for anyone who genuinely doesn't follow it, it's basically a site that serves as a collective of forums

13:07.520 --> 13:11.520
or what they call subreddits for people to find others who might share interests

13:11.520 --> 13:13.520
and then to post in them and maybe comment on them.

13:13.520 --> 13:17.520
And this can be basically anything at all, within the guidelines of course,

13:17.520 --> 13:19.520
from homosexuality to mean girls.

13:19.520 --> 13:22.520
And I'm really not a regular of Reddit, but I know that much.

13:22.520 --> 13:26.520
Subreddit that is the focus of this part is r slash videos,

13:26.520 --> 13:29.520
which is a forum where people can post content that they like.

13:29.520 --> 13:32.520
It is a fairly well organised subreddit with users galore,

13:32.520 --> 13:35.520
and various tabs that can basically arrange the post how you would like them.

13:35.520 --> 13:40.520
However, the very important tab here is obviously what was called in 2014 the hot tab.

13:40.520 --> 13:44.520
Now, Gray's video isn't doing too much, it had been a year and a half since release,

13:44.520 --> 13:50.520
and yet a user by the quaint name of Bonerboy, lovely, posted his video to the r slash videos subreddit

13:50.520 --> 13:52.520
with the title as the caption.

13:52.520 --> 13:55.520
Now unfortunately, I do not have a screenshot of it doing the rounds

13:55.520 --> 13:57.520
because there weren't any that I could find,

13:57.520 --> 14:00.520
but there is one of the post itself very briefly after it was posted,

14:00.520 --> 14:03.520
and you can see that it quickly picked up steam,

14:03.520 --> 14:07.520
receiving appraisal from many of the users who enjoyed his crude style in reading the comments.

14:07.520 --> 14:11.520
It hearkens back to my earlier comparisons with regards to animators too,

14:11.520 --> 14:15.520
with many people suggesting that content would have fit very aptly into the Newgrounds site,

14:15.520 --> 14:18.520
a website renowned for the animators it hosted.

14:18.520 --> 14:20.520
And that's what this video hit home with.

14:20.520 --> 14:24.520
Gray seemed like a throwback creator with a twist thrown in, and the masses had spoken.

14:24.520 --> 14:27.520
They decided that this is the content they wanted, but Gray was gone.

14:27.520 --> 14:31.520
He had legitimately forgot he even made a YouTube account.

14:31.520 --> 14:33.520
I mean, hell, he didn't even have an avatar.

14:33.520 --> 14:35.520
The under-a side was clearly taking over.

14:35.520 --> 14:39.520
In fact, Gray was on Facebook when he saw his video being shared,

14:39.520 --> 14:42.520
and realised that suddenly he had an audience, and an audience to answer to,

14:42.520 --> 14:46.520
and as acknowledged in a tweet he'd make a year later, it kicked his channel off.

14:46.520 --> 14:49.520
So if Bonerboy hadn't made that post on that Reddit,

14:49.520 --> 14:52.520
Gray probably would have never uploaded another YouTube video.

14:52.520 --> 14:54.520
And yet, here we are.

14:54.520 --> 14:58.520
With the success of his content, Gray made a video committing to more uploads,

14:58.520 --> 15:03.520
and unlike 90% of the creators who commit to more uploads before disappearing off the face of the Earth,

15:03.520 --> 15:06.520
he actually stayed true to his word, for now.

15:06.520 --> 15:08.520
And we witness some spicy content.

15:08.520 --> 15:11.520
His video following this was known as the Paralympics,

15:11.520 --> 15:14.520
and this is where Gray begins to really cement that persona.

15:14.520 --> 15:16.520
I've spoken about how his content can be funny,

15:16.520 --> 15:19.520
but being good and being popular are not the same,

15:19.520 --> 15:24.520
and having mass appeal can often mean you might sacrifice niche qualities that you may take preference to.

15:24.520 --> 15:26.520
But Gray was very consistent.

15:26.520 --> 15:29.520
He took a perspective of great ignorance.

15:29.520 --> 15:31.520
Now that might sound like a criticism,

15:31.520 --> 15:36.520
it would be if I went to Gray's channel looking for insightful commentary or some bold truth teller,

15:36.520 --> 15:39.520
but you don't, you go for crude jokes from a judgemental twat,

15:39.520 --> 15:42.520
and the thing about ignorance is that for many people, it is relatable.

15:42.520 --> 15:46.520
Most people don't know much about a lot, doesn't mean they're stupid,

15:46.520 --> 15:51.520
some people have a few subjects in which they specialize in due to career reasons or specific interests,

15:51.520 --> 15:53.520
but ignorance is relatable in a way,

15:53.520 --> 15:56.520
and so you have videos that may not be completely accurate,

15:56.520 --> 15:59.520
but you get the impression that they're quite aware they're not,

15:59.520 --> 16:02.520
because he's putting on a stupid voice, he's allowed to be stupid,

16:02.520 --> 16:07.520
but at the same time, he's playing with the cynical, judgemental thoughts that cross many people's minds,

16:07.520 --> 16:09.520
like do horse jockeys even do anything?

16:09.520 --> 16:11.520
Surely it's the horse that needs to be disabled.

16:11.520 --> 16:14.520
The dumbest thing on earth.

16:14.520 --> 16:17.520
Paralympic horse riding.

16:17.520 --> 16:22.520
The reason it's so dumb is that it's not the horse that has to be disabled,

16:22.520 --> 16:25.520
it's the rider.

16:25.520 --> 16:29.520
You don't do anything rider, you just sit there.

16:29.520 --> 16:35.520
So for example these two fine chaps, they can't be in the Paralympics,

16:35.520 --> 16:40.520
but this Lloyd's TSB majestic stallion could,

16:40.520 --> 16:45.520
because his rider's missing a finger or an eyebrow or something.

16:45.520 --> 16:49.520
Now I'm sure with a bit of research you'd find out otherwise, but people don't care.

16:49.520 --> 16:53.520
It's easier to think about it simply and get a laugh out of someone's rants.

16:53.520 --> 16:56.520
He's the comedian who says the stupid stuff and gets the laugh,

16:56.520 --> 16:59.520
because it's somewhat based in the assumptions that people make themselves.

16:59.520 --> 17:01.520
It is relatable in its ignorance.

17:01.520 --> 17:05.520
During the last few months of 2014, in the wake of his son's success,

17:05.520 --> 17:08.520
Grade would upload multiple videos in the same format,

17:08.520 --> 17:10.520
just talking about stuff in this style.

17:10.520 --> 17:14.520
This would cement him as a creator and lead to significant and consistent growth

17:14.520 --> 17:16.520
throughout the coming few months.

17:16.520 --> 17:20.520
He would rant about Tinder, toilets, interviews, basically anything that bothered him.

17:20.520 --> 17:23.520
He'd become more and more creative with these gags,

17:23.520 --> 17:28.520
make longer content but still hold on to many of the rather simplistic aspects of his videos,

17:28.520 --> 17:30.520
balancing that feeling of progression.

17:30.520 --> 17:35.520
With the notion of familiarity, like upgrading a car rather than purchasing a new model.

17:35.520 --> 17:39.520
You still need to make people feel like they're watching a Grade A under A video.

17:39.520 --> 17:42.520
When the video that we're discussing today came around,

17:42.520 --> 17:45.520
Ray was sat on a respectable 29,000 subscribers.

17:45.520 --> 17:49.520
His growth had been solid and steady with occasional spikes aided by the algorithm.

17:49.520 --> 17:52.520
His videos typically surpassed his subscriber count

17:52.520 --> 17:55.520
and he was being aided by various supports on other websites.

17:55.520 --> 17:57.520
Obviously I mentioned my encounter with a Facebook post.

17:57.520 --> 17:59.520
However, we're entering 2015.

17:59.520 --> 18:01.520
And you know what that means?

18:01.520 --> 18:04.520
Well, the start of a little genre called commentary,

18:04.520 --> 18:06.520
believe you who is someone I'm sure we'll talk about eventually,

18:06.520 --> 18:10.520
sat mid-February on around 23,000 subscribers.

18:10.520 --> 18:14.520
Fairly respectable, that's only because most of them came from a Minecraft PVP channel.

18:14.520 --> 18:18.520
However, under a month later, Grade would get his first taste of drama

18:18.520 --> 18:20.520
with someone known as Ray William Johnson.

18:20.520 --> 18:24.520
Ray William Johnson was one of the largest creators on the platform

18:24.520 --> 18:27.520
and although he wasn't anywhere near his peak at this time,

18:27.520 --> 18:30.520
he was still pulling respectable numbers on his videos,

18:30.520 --> 18:34.520
the sort of numbers that I would dream about getting on a constant basis.

18:34.520 --> 18:38.520
He had a lot of successful ventures, so calling him out was a pretty big deal

18:38.520 --> 18:41.520
because you're going to be dealing with his still sizable fanbase,

18:41.520 --> 18:44.520
this guy on over 10 million subscribers.

18:44.520 --> 18:46.520
So, what happened?

18:46.520 --> 18:48.520
I'm late all the time.

18:48.520 --> 18:52.520
I am probably gonna be late for work every day.

18:55.520 --> 18:58.520
So tell me about a weakness of yours.

18:58.520 --> 19:00.520
Oh my god, where to start?

19:00.520 --> 19:03.520
What would you say is your greatest weakness?

19:03.520 --> 19:05.520
Where do I start? Uhh...

19:07.520 --> 19:10.520
Right, where do you see yourself in five years' time?

19:10.520 --> 19:13.520
Hopefully, not still in this shithole.

19:13.520 --> 19:16.520
Where do you see yourself in five years?

19:16.520 --> 19:17.520
Not in this shithole.

19:17.520 --> 19:20.520
Well, shit.

19:25.520 --> 19:32.520
To understand the situation, we go back to the video before it,

19:32.520 --> 19:36.520
Why I Hate Interviews, in which Grey goes on one of his typical rants

19:36.520 --> 19:39.520
interspersed with his comedy that we've previously discussed.

19:39.520 --> 19:41.520
At some point in this video, he mocks up an interview

19:41.520 --> 19:44.520
and responds to it in a fairly candid fashion.

19:44.520 --> 19:47.520
Eleven days later, Ray William Johnson uploads the video

19:47.520 --> 19:51.520
How To Ace Job Interviews, a sarcastic title for a run of sketches

19:51.520 --> 19:54.520
in which the applicant provides the worst answers possible.

19:54.520 --> 19:56.520
However, some of these responses, more specifically,

19:56.520 --> 19:59.520
three of them had a strange resemblance to Grey's answers.

19:59.520 --> 20:00.520
And you know what?

20:00.520 --> 20:02.520
That's certainly not something to be ignored,

20:02.520 --> 20:05.520
especially when it's one of the site's largest creators,

20:05.520 --> 20:08.520
stealing from a significantly smaller creator.

20:08.520 --> 20:10.520
But what's Grey gonna do about it?

20:10.520 --> 20:13.520
Now we're in March 2015, commentaries hasn't merged yet,

20:13.520 --> 20:15.520
but we're definitely in the rumblings of it.

20:15.520 --> 20:18.520
And I want to talk about drama for a brief moment for that reason.

20:18.520 --> 20:20.520
Drama always existed,

20:20.520 --> 20:23.520
especially when you're dealing with genres that involve personalities

20:23.520 --> 20:26.520
rather than just personas, which is why the gaming community,

20:26.520 --> 20:29.520
in spite of their relatively avoidant attitude to drama,

20:29.520 --> 20:30.520
did have their incidents.

20:30.520 --> 20:33.520
Commentary in the last few years, however, has taken over the drama scene,

20:33.520 --> 20:36.520
because for many commentators, it is highly beneficial for their channel

20:36.520 --> 20:38.520
that they talk about drama.

20:38.520 --> 20:40.520
And it's like the media when they report an incident.

20:40.520 --> 20:43.520
Often it's not just the drama itself that guards the attention,

20:43.520 --> 20:45.520
but the people who actually cover it.

20:45.520 --> 20:49.520
You're always looking for the hot take from that one person you want to hear talk.

20:49.520 --> 20:53.520
With that said, Grey didn't have the same approach that many commentators do today.

20:53.520 --> 20:56.520
If I felt someone had ripped me off, unfortunately I wouldn't be able to turn around

20:56.520 --> 20:59.520
and make a 30 minute video, as fun as it might be.

20:59.520 --> 21:02.520
In fact, many commentators wouldn't want to make a video on someone

21:02.520 --> 21:06.520
who might have copied their joke, because it would be seen as petty or going overboard.

21:06.520 --> 21:08.520
This is where we bring in Grey's style.

21:08.520 --> 21:11.520
Grey's comedy was found with him being excessive.

21:11.520 --> 21:14.520
His videos could also be very short and not really have much meaning.

21:14.520 --> 21:17.520
So he made this video questioning whether Grey had quote, plagiarised him.

21:17.520 --> 21:20.520
He opened with the corresponding clips in question, before doing this.

21:47.520 --> 21:56.520
Now this isn't the last time he would use this demeanor.

21:56.520 --> 22:01.520
What he's doing is he's using comedy as a masquerade to push quite genuine accusations.

22:01.520 --> 22:06.520
Grey's videos felt tongue-in-cheek enough to not necessarily take seriously in their tone,

22:06.520 --> 22:09.520
they were too self-aware and comedic to frame him negatively,

22:09.520 --> 22:13.520
but their arguments too well presented to completely ignore in their points.

22:13.520 --> 22:16.520
If we're speaking formally, you can't really prove that Grey was plagiarising,

22:16.520 --> 22:19.520
because as concepts, they're a bit too general to be claimed,

22:19.520 --> 22:22.520
but it is very plausible that Grey did take the jokes.

22:22.520 --> 22:25.520
It does seem a bit too similar to be a coincidence.

22:25.520 --> 22:30.520
Grey's video on this quickly gained traction and hit over 200,000 views in a few days.

22:30.520 --> 22:33.520
I mean, calling anyone out is always good for a quick rush of views,

22:33.520 --> 22:36.520
and although at first it wasn't universally well received,

22:36.520 --> 22:40.520
you can see the like-dislike ratio is still strongly in his favour.

22:40.520 --> 22:43.520
Compare this to a recent drama, for example Coffee Break's video,

22:43.520 --> 22:45.520
which I do plan on discussing in the future,

22:45.520 --> 22:48.520
because he mainly framed his problems very seriously,

22:48.520 --> 22:51.520
many people have now responded and began to call him petty,

22:51.520 --> 22:54.520
which has affected many people's feeling about the whole drama.

22:54.520 --> 22:56.520
As Grey goes, he's done pretty well.

22:56.520 --> 23:00.520
This was his first taste of drama, but not really much came beyond of it.

23:00.520 --> 23:03.520
There was an article written on the Daily Dots and a bit of buzz at the time,

23:03.520 --> 23:05.520
but Johnson never really responded.

23:05.520 --> 23:07.520
Because Grey was such a small YouTuber at the time,

23:07.520 --> 23:09.520
he would have been punching down fairly hard,

23:09.520 --> 23:13.520
and he probably didn't want to strengthen it unless he had a concrete response,

23:13.520 --> 23:14.520
which would have been hard.

23:14.520 --> 23:17.520
So life went on, Grey did alright from the situation,

23:17.520 --> 23:21.520
and decided to go back to the sort of content that people at that time knew him for.

23:21.520 --> 23:23.520
However, this was about to change again,

23:23.520 --> 23:27.520
because now we're in June, and a little-known YouTuber by the name of Leafy

23:27.520 --> 23:29.520
was beginning to gather significant momentum.

23:29.520 --> 23:33.520
Grey, in a similar position, decided once again to make a different kind of video,

23:33.520 --> 23:38.520
this time calling out a YouTuber by the name of Richard Burgess, aka Vegan Gains.

23:38.520 --> 23:43.520
Basically, a blatant bait video, because Vegan Gains was known to respond to everyone.

23:43.520 --> 23:46.520
His video alleged that Vegan Gains was fairly dishonest in his content,

23:46.520 --> 23:49.520
unbelievably biased towards anyone on a vegan diet,

23:49.520 --> 23:54.520
and promotes a lot of misinformation that people should definitely take with a grain of salt.

23:54.520 --> 23:57.520
However, at the end of the video, Grey takes a slightly different approach.

23:57.520 --> 23:58.520
You damn good as well.

23:58.520 --> 24:00.520
But the ones now, they're just garbage.

24:00.520 --> 24:04.520
Now hopefully, I don't have to make any more videos about you.

24:04.520 --> 24:08.520
I've already made two other videos that are ready to be uploaded in like a second's notice, right?

24:08.520 --> 24:13.520
One of the videos that I have is one of his worst of the YouTube fitness industry videos

24:13.520 --> 24:16.520
that I stole when I hacked into Vegan Gains' computer.

24:16.520 --> 24:18.520
Because I'm a hacker, me, right?

24:18.520 --> 24:21.520
And it's one he didn't upload for very good reason.

24:21.520 --> 24:24.520
It's not one he would want you seeing, trust me.

24:24.520 --> 24:26.520
And as if that wasn't saucy enough,

24:26.520 --> 24:31.520
the other video that I've got is a personal video message to Vegan Gains

24:31.520 --> 24:34.520
from a very fucking surprising source.

24:35.520 --> 24:38.520
Now this is where Grey's very ambiguous tone comes into play.

24:38.520 --> 24:40.520
It's quite clear that he isn't a hacker,

24:40.520 --> 24:44.520
but it's still possible that he's managed to get his hands onto some sort of incriminating file.

24:44.520 --> 24:46.520
Vegan Gains is a volatile character,

24:46.520 --> 24:52.520
and it's not impossible to suggest that maybe there are a few deleted videos of him floating around the web

24:52.520 --> 24:54.520
that have him doing some pretty strong things.

24:54.520 --> 24:56.520
Grey presents him with the quote,

24:56.520 --> 24:57.520
Ultimatum.

24:57.520 --> 25:01.520
Responder is going to make another video where he uploads everything.

25:01.520 --> 25:03.520
Listen, this is just me being a bit of an idiot, right?

25:03.520 --> 25:04.520
This is just playful banter, yeah?

25:04.520 --> 25:08.520
But listen, Vegan Gains, if you don't reply to this video and explain yourself

25:08.520 --> 25:12.520
and address all the points I've brought up in this video and explain your lies, right?

25:12.520 --> 25:16.520
I will take it as a personal insult, and I will post both of them, right?

25:16.520 --> 25:18.520
Man, listen, I like you, mate.

25:18.520 --> 25:22.520
You're a bit annoying here and there, but overall, I do like you, mate.

25:22.520 --> 25:25.520
Don't make me post those videos, man.

25:25.520 --> 25:28.520
So Vegan Gains decided to respond by, well, not responding.

25:28.520 --> 25:30.520
This clearly caught Grey off,

25:30.520 --> 25:33.520
because Vegan Gains was renowned for going after people,

25:33.520 --> 25:36.520
and yet like Donald Trump not responding to Eminem,

25:36.520 --> 25:39.520
the one time where you'd expect him to respond, he didn't.

25:39.520 --> 25:41.520
So when Vegan Gains didn't respond,

25:41.520 --> 25:46.520
Grey uploaded the update video that threatened to release the three very important unseen videos,

25:46.520 --> 25:48.520
providing a specific due date,

25:48.520 --> 25:51.520
that being Saturday the 4th of July 2015.

25:51.520 --> 25:55.520
Once again, having this sort of due date makes Grey seem more serious

25:55.520 --> 25:59.520
and presents this to Vegan Gains to encourage that response.

25:59.520 --> 26:03.520
He hypes it up and says we all need to tweet it at the Vegan Gains nemeses,

26:03.520 --> 26:05.520
and obtain their attention.

26:05.520 --> 26:08.520
Everyone's on the edge of his seats. What's Grey going to reveal?

26:08.520 --> 26:11.520
Well, not much. In fact, Grey was just bluffing.

26:11.520 --> 26:15.520
The third video was released, and the alleged clips were presented were not as expected.

26:15.520 --> 26:18.520
If you expected anything at all, that is.

26:18.520 --> 26:23.520
One of them was a cut-up compilation where you know the one where you remix someone's speech to change the message.

26:23.520 --> 26:27.520
The second video, a special message from someone, was another meme,

26:27.520 --> 26:32.520
and the rest of the video was spent going through Vegan Gains' old channel and just digging up various comments.

26:32.520 --> 26:36.520
From one perspective, it could be seen as rather desperate from Grey,

26:36.520 --> 26:39.520
to basically threaten someone into giving you their attention.

26:39.520 --> 26:42.520
And he makes it no secret, that's kind of what he was trying to do.

26:42.520 --> 26:47.520
Okay, now listen, if I'm honest, I said that if Vegan Gains didn't reply to my previous video,

26:47.520 --> 26:49.520
that I would then release these other two, right?

26:49.520 --> 26:53.520
Which was a complete lie, like regardless of what he did, I was still going to upload him, right?

26:53.520 --> 26:56.520
And yet, coming out of it, he received very little criticism,

26:56.520 --> 27:00.520
and appeared with a big W to his name. Why is that?

27:00.520 --> 27:03.520
Well, firstly, Vegan Gains isn't really popular,

27:03.520 --> 27:05.520
and people can't really feel bad for him,

27:05.520 --> 27:08.520
regardless of whether he was right or not to respond.

27:08.520 --> 27:12.520
And a lot of Grey's criticisms in his first video were fairly valid.

27:12.520 --> 27:16.520
But the second reason this little stunt worked was because of his persona, Grade-A Under-A.

27:16.520 --> 27:19.520
In his comedy videos, you don't really see that contrast too much,

27:19.520 --> 27:25.520
but in these more drama-oriented videos, on one hand you have the Grade-A side that can deliver criticism,

27:25.520 --> 27:31.520
and yet the uneven delivery, and the messy tone, and the comedy falls towards the Under-A side.

27:31.520 --> 27:34.520
And this meant that as long as he acknowledged his intentions,

27:34.520 --> 27:37.520
with enough self-awareness, he'd typically receive a pass.

27:37.520 --> 27:42.520
This is interesting because while he emerged in a time where comedy dominated YouTube,

27:42.520 --> 27:46.520
clearly reflected in his style, we were entering a more dramatic phase.

27:46.520 --> 27:50.520
The times were changing, and Grade had to change with them as well.

27:50.520 --> 27:53.520
But to do that, we have to understand drama.

27:55.520 --> 28:08.520
The Thing About Drama

28:08.520 --> 28:11.520
The thing about drama is that there are various routes you can take.

28:11.520 --> 28:15.520
You can take the route of being the moralist, being the person who dictates how you should act,

28:15.520 --> 28:20.520
down to the small details, what words you should and shouldn't use, etc.

28:20.520 --> 28:25.520
If you want to deal criticism like that, you need to set an example of how to deal it.

28:25.520 --> 28:30.520
On the other hand, you have people who don't give a shit about 90% of things when they're criticising others,

28:30.520 --> 28:35.520
and although this might seem less pure in many of their characteristics, it makes them harder to criticise.

28:35.520 --> 28:40.520
A great example of this is iDubbbz, another significant player later on in the story.

28:40.520 --> 28:44.520
Some people may criticise him for his fairly nonchalant approach to the use of certain words,

28:44.520 --> 28:47.520
as shown in the Tana Mongeau content copy made,

28:47.520 --> 28:52.520
but he turns this around and says, well I don't think that defines my morality, so take it or leave it.

28:52.520 --> 28:56.520
You can criticise him, but you can't really end him or cancel him,

28:56.520 --> 29:00.520
because what he did was proxy to a much greater point against the target,

29:00.520 --> 29:04.520
and regardless of how much Twitter would like to paint it as a black and white issue,

29:04.520 --> 29:06.520
you'll experience very different attitudes.

29:06.520 --> 29:12.520
With Vegan Gains, Grade isn't necessarily behaving morally, in fact he comes across as a bit of a pest,

29:13.520 --> 29:18.520
but he doesn't need to behave morally because he kind of acknowledges it and integrates it into his persona,

29:18.520 --> 29:22.520
often acknowledging the fact that you're not perfect can humanise yourself in the eyes of your viewers,

29:22.520 --> 29:25.520
while being able to deliver some sort of criticism.

29:25.520 --> 29:31.520
In the instance of Vegan Gains, he is a liar, and being a liar is an easy criticism because it implies a logical falsehood.

29:31.520 --> 29:36.520
It's typically rather simple, unless you can appeal to a greater good, like a white lie.

29:36.520 --> 29:40.520
With the success of this drama, in spite of the disappointing lack of response,

29:40.520 --> 29:44.520
Grade would begin to start doing these sorts of videos a bit more regularly,

29:44.520 --> 29:48.520
and the thing is, I don't think a lot of people really notice much difference in the videos,

29:48.520 --> 29:53.520
mainly because Grade had such a grip on his style, his character encompassed all those topics,

29:53.520 --> 29:55.520
and he definitely takes this going forward.

29:55.520 --> 30:00.520
His next targets were Jinx and CJSoCool, two fairly unpopular reaction channels,

30:00.520 --> 30:06.520
who were notorious for basically playing videos and reacting to them in a way that provided no level of transformation whatsoever.

30:06.520 --> 30:11.520
Grade's video on them was a lot tighter in its points and used pretty affirmative evidence to convey his sentiments.

30:12.520 --> 30:17.520
Now listen to this, right? It's like a 17 minute, 16 second video, right?

30:17.520 --> 30:23.520
Of which, literally 45 seconds is not KSI's video.

30:23.520 --> 30:28.520
So CJ's video is literally over 95% KSI, right?

30:28.520 --> 30:30.520
Which is ridiculous!

30:30.520 --> 30:34.520
Obviously they're gonna get popularity if they're stealing some of the biggest YouTuber's content, right?

30:34.520 --> 30:35.520
That's so hard, isn't it?

30:35.520 --> 30:40.520
Now what must have particularly pleased Grade in this situation was that Jinx actually responded,

30:40.520 --> 30:43.520
and he responded with all the grace that you'd expect from a reaction channel.

30:43.520 --> 30:50.520
Now first thing I wanna say before I even start going down this list is the fact that this guy hates me because I'm popular.

30:50.520 --> 30:52.520
Because I'm YouTube popular.

30:52.520 --> 30:55.520
That is the one reason that it all boils down to.

30:55.520 --> 30:59.520
He can say he's not a hater, he can say all of that, but let's just be honest.

30:59.520 --> 31:04.520
And when you make a well-formed call-out video, going after channels who clearly think they are much better than they are,

31:04.520 --> 31:06.520
it feels good for the audience to be a part of that.

31:07.520 --> 31:13.520
The main reason it felt so good for many of Grade's fans was because Grade had intertwined it very delicately with his comedy.

31:13.520 --> 31:17.520
His comedy being rooted in that relatability of the judgemental nature.

31:17.520 --> 31:22.520
We've all seen some very successful YouTubers and thought, what the hell do they do that's special?

31:22.520 --> 31:23.520
They're rubbish.

31:23.520 --> 31:30.520
Grade took these thoughts and turned them into videos and combined them with more concise points and evidence to convince people of his case.

31:30.520 --> 31:35.520
So even when he was being fairly blunt, it felt natural because his persona allowed him to do that.

31:35.520 --> 31:40.520
Reaction channels are basically like a place for you to watch a video with someone else.

31:40.520 --> 31:44.520
What the fuck, mate? That's one of the stupidest things I've ever heard.

31:44.520 --> 31:47.520
I might as well go out and buy a blow-up doll. It's less annoying than you.

31:47.520 --> 31:52.520
A response from Jinx, even like that, trying to be as indirect as possible is more attention,

31:52.520 --> 31:57.520
because someone's going to ask what the video is, someone's going to know, and they're going to redirect it.

31:57.520 --> 32:01.520
Especially if you're going after a larger YouTuber, who is an idiot.

32:01.520 --> 32:06.520
Jinx had no personality, so trying to show any sort of anger felt like arrogance,

32:06.520 --> 32:09.520
because it could only be correlated with his size, not his persona.

32:09.520 --> 32:15.520
Through this, however, Grade did create a fanbase that were involved in the more dramatic side of Grade's work.

32:15.520 --> 32:18.520
And following this, he went after more easy targets.

32:18.520 --> 32:23.520
Nicole Arbour, prank channels, Nicole Arbour again, prank channels again, prank channels again.

32:23.520 --> 32:28.520
And although these videos were fairly decent in a lot of their criticism, with a fair amount of evidence,

32:28.520 --> 32:33.520
when you spend so much time dishing out copious amounts of criticism in the sort of tone that Grade did,

32:33.520 --> 32:38.520
it became inevitable that he was going to grow out a channel much more drama-oriented.

32:38.520 --> 32:45.520
Now, looking back in retrospect, it becomes clear that a lot of his more story-time-oriented content has outperformed his drama videos.

32:45.520 --> 32:51.520
However, at the same time, his drama videos were some of the most popular on the site in the moment.

32:51.520 --> 32:55.520
This was mainly because commentary was emerging with the people we've already discussed,

32:55.520 --> 32:58.520
entering the stage where people felt comfortable calling others out.

32:58.520 --> 33:03.520
With the rise of three pretty pivotal channels, we could see the tone of criticism evolving.

33:03.520 --> 33:09.520
I identify these three channels as H3, iDubbbz, and obviously our main man here, GradeAUnderA.

33:09.520 --> 33:13.520
All of these channels became porchbearers in calling out who they deemed to be twats.

33:13.520 --> 33:18.520
This then brought a secondary wave of channels who typically focused their content on other topics,

33:18.520 --> 33:24.520
but would often drop by on commentary issues, such as I Hate Everything, Pyrocynical, Leafy Boogie, and so on.

33:24.520 --> 33:30.520
It was something fun to involve yourself in, and on top of this, it created more attention to the topics that people were discussing.

33:30.520 --> 33:38.520
This was catalysed by the numerous incidents at the turn of 2016, alongside the launch of iDubbbz's series, Content Cop,

33:38.520 --> 33:45.520
which basically set commentary on fire, particularly the Jinx episode, which of course, almost led to the infamous boxing match.

33:45.520 --> 33:50.520
Don't get it twisted, Grade was one of the first on the scene to make these sorts of videos,

33:50.520 --> 33:56.520
with an already established audience that identified the style, and therefore benefited of this development greatly.

33:56.520 --> 34:00.520
Equally in a perverted way, the drama videos worked in the vein that his comedy videos did.

34:00.520 --> 34:07.520
Judgemental twats and relatability, we have those feelings towards those creators, that's why he went after unpopular people,

34:07.520 --> 34:13.520
because many people already hated them. When you're targeting other people, you have to be prepared to become a target,

34:13.520 --> 34:19.520
and 2016 was a new year for many reasons, many reasons that we'll find out in the next video.

34:19.520 --> 34:25.520
Because this script is going to be very long, and I've learned that it's probably not best to exhaust your audience to that extent,

34:25.520 --> 34:28.520
though other videos definitely have had me trying.

34:33.520 --> 34:38.520
So that was the video, I really hope you guys enjoyed it, I want to give a big shoutout to my editors,

34:38.520 --> 34:43.520
who've once again done a fantastic, beautiful job, I love them very much.

34:43.520 --> 34:51.520
Make sure you check them out. I also need to give a shoutout to my Patreons, the current Patreons listed on the screen right now,

34:51.520 --> 34:59.520
and I also have to give special shoutouts to my $50 Patreons, Connor, Somehullerblue, and Evening Steel,

34:59.520 --> 35:06.520
all the three of you, thank you so much, it does genuinely make a difference, especially with YouTube's slightly unpredictable behaviour recently.

35:06.520 --> 35:13.520
$100 too, I have to give the mention to Brandon and Ryan, truly incredible people,

35:13.520 --> 35:18.520
and eternally grateful for their support, thank you guys, it makes a big difference.

35:18.520 --> 35:25.520
Otherwise, if you want to, you can hit me up on Twitter, Discord, I even check Facebook sometimes,

35:25.520 --> 35:29.520
most of the platforms, and I do my best to be responsive.

35:29.520 --> 35:32.520
Otherwise, I don't really have too much else to say, I hope you enjoyed the video,

35:32.520 --> 35:36.520
we'd love to hear your thoughts in the comment section, opinions are always welcome.

35:36.520 --> 35:40.520
Until then, I'm The Right Opinion, and I'll see you in the next one.

36:02.520 --> 36:04.520
I'm doing you, if you can.

36:32.520 --> 36:36.520
Thanks for watching!
