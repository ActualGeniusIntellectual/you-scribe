Hello, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with

00:13.500 --> 00:17.400
too much free time, and YouTubers, although there are certainly a lot of them to choose

00:17.400 --> 00:20.840
from, many would at least say the largest greats on the platform are comparable to the

00:20.840 --> 00:34.320
everyday Hollywood celebrity. This seems increasingly accurate as the platform continues to manifest

00:34.320 --> 00:37.900
and evolve larger and larger channels, headed by figures who have become identifiable to

00:37.900 --> 00:42.000
even those without a passing interest in the video hosting website. YouTube isn't like

00:42.000 --> 00:45.700
the mainstream media though, many figureheads are not handpicked, and many have much more

00:45.700 --> 00:49.820
centralised control of their content and their vision than certain personages who may be

00:49.820 --> 00:54.140
subject to studios and investors. For many, this is what makes YouTube such a good platform

00:54.140 --> 00:58.500
to launch one's career, as success is almost exclusively decided by the audience who watch

00:58.500 --> 01:02.660
it. However, on the other hand, YouTube is still a very small tranche of media as a whole,

01:02.660 --> 01:06.340
and many who achieve the treasured status of mega influencer often begin to look beyond

01:06.340 --> 01:10.140
the realms of the platform to further their career. In many ways, this should be a recipe

01:10.140 --> 01:13.740
for success, the personal relationship that many creators produce with their channel often

01:13.740 --> 01:18.020
gives them a fanbase much more dedicated than that of the average celeb utens. They've

01:18.020 --> 01:21.820
already crafted a multi-million subscriber channel from a very limited set of resources,

01:21.820 --> 01:24.900
imagine what they could do with the sort of financial backing that many of these large

01:24.900 --> 01:28.980
corporations can provide. Think of all the wondrous creations that could be brought into

01:28.980 --> 01:37.200
being. It's strange really, because in spite of the numerous attempts to bring popular

01:37.200 --> 01:41.660
YouTubers into the mainstream sphere, a proportionally low number have actually succeeded. There

01:41.660 --> 01:45.840
are a few large musicians and comedians who had their start on the video sharing platform,

01:45.840 --> 01:49.440
which makes sense in a way as there are also occupations which can command an exceptionally

01:49.440 --> 01:53.200
dedicated fanbase, but besides this, many creators trying to spread their wings have

01:53.200 --> 01:57.520
often been met with limited prosperity outside of their comfort zone. Why is this often the

01:57.520 --> 01:58.520
case?

01:58.520 --> 02:01.680
Well, to be honest, I don't think it's really a problem with the YouTuber themselves.

02:01.680 --> 02:05.140
As a matter of fact, many mainstream celebrities of the younger generations have been revealed

02:05.140 --> 02:08.240
to have possessed YouTube channels at some point, even if they weren't particularly

02:08.240 --> 02:11.680
lucrative in their time. It tells me that the same sort of star power that can drive

02:11.680 --> 02:15.400
a mainstream celebrity can also drive many large YouTubers. I think the main problem

02:15.400 --> 02:18.920
is rooted in the fact that many ventures by popular creators into mainstream media

02:18.920 --> 02:22.800
seek to capitalise on their YouTube success without being sensitive to the format that

02:22.800 --> 02:26.480
it's being adapted to. Although they may not seem particularly different on the surface,

02:26.480 --> 02:30.720
a good comedy on YouTube works for very different reasons than a good comedy film works, and

02:30.720 --> 02:34.840
the sort of five second humour that lands here may well fall flat elsewhere. A lot of

02:34.840 --> 02:38.280
YouTube comedy thrives on spontaneity and randomness. If you want to translate that

02:38.280 --> 02:42.480
into the world of established media, you still need infrastructure that supports it. Additionally,

02:42.480 --> 02:47.080
the contrimences of a lot of entertainment content tend to subdue the appeal of the individual

02:47.080 --> 02:50.720
creator, whose personality is often placed at the forefront of their online work, but

02:50.720 --> 02:54.620
may otherwise fall into the background amongst elevated production values. It's not that

02:54.620 --> 02:57.800
creators can't work in the mainstream world, it's just that the mainstream world often

02:57.800 --> 03:01.520
doesn't know what to do with them, and the medium often isn't supportive of it. But

03:01.520 --> 03:21.560
here's the answer to this quandary right in front of us the whole time. Lay Night

03:21.560 --> 03:25.600
Talk shows one of the leading forms of media, particularly in the United States of America,

03:25.600 --> 03:29.400
where figures like Jimmy Kimmel, David Letterman, and Conan O'Brien have been immortalised

03:29.400 --> 03:33.680
by their eponymous programs. In the past few years, it has also found significant popularity

03:33.680 --> 03:37.320
on YouTube, with clips from the broadcast garnering billions of views between them,

03:37.320 --> 03:41.160
its standalone segments allowing for easy rendering to a site built on that sort of

03:41.160 --> 03:44.320
content. Although the subjects are likely planned, prepared, and researched, there is

03:44.320 --> 03:48.440
an impromptu element that allows the host to rip, which shows integrating sketches,

03:48.440 --> 03:52.480
interviews, and audience interactions, all of which coast off the charisma of the presenter.

03:52.480 --> 03:56.700
Its success on YouTube had already been proven, but what happens if we reverse the formula,

03:56.700 --> 04:11.540
and put a YouTuber in a talk show? This is where we introduce today's title character,

04:11.540 --> 04:15.060
a YouTuber by the name of Lilly Singh. Lilly Singh was one of the most prominent YouTube

04:15.060 --> 04:19.260
cultivated comedians of the 2010s, a sketchy often garnished with commentary, but became

04:19.260 --> 04:23.160
adored by many viewers for its ability to portray everyday experiences in an accurate

04:23.160 --> 04:26.960
yet amusing fashion. She would regularly depict fictionalised figures, including her

04:26.960 --> 04:31.240
overbearing conservative parents, and integrate her experiences as the second generation daughter

04:31.240 --> 04:36.120
of migrants to Canada, contrasting their traditional values with her exposure to western culture.

04:36.120 --> 04:39.360
This resonated with many around the world, and in the space of a few years, racked up

04:39.360 --> 04:43.240
her channel over 10 million subscribers, becoming one of the most subscribed to channels in

04:43.240 --> 04:47.520
the process. With such fame, further opportunities followed, with many of those expected for

04:47.520 --> 04:51.100
some one of her influence. However, probably the most notable and well documented of those

04:51.100 --> 04:55.380
was her role in the pioneering show A Little Late with Lilly Singh, which planned to take

04:55.380 --> 04:59.560
her brand of YouTube comedy to a whole new level. With proven results, and a format that

04:59.560 --> 05:03.900
should nurture her talents, it seemed like a match made in heaven. However, it felt like

05:03.900 --> 05:05.900
as soon as it started, it was over.

05:05.900 --> 05:10.500
Lilly Singh-"I believe in this show, because NBC believes in this show, but most importantly

05:10.500 --> 05:13.220
because you believed in this show."

05:13.220 --> 05:17.060
In spite of the promising premise, the show was nearly immediately marred in criticism,

05:17.060 --> 05:21.160
controversy, and COVID, and after just two seasons, it was dropped from the ever-rotating

05:21.160 --> 05:25.780
roster of late night shows, ending another YouTuber experiment with somewhat disappointing

05:25.780 --> 05:30.500
results and leaving the question of the compatibility of YouTube's success hanging in the balance.

05:30.500 --> 05:34.980
During the show's runtime, many creators and critics alike attempted to point out exactly

05:34.980 --> 05:39.040
what didn't work about this show, but now with its fate sealed, I think we should revisit

05:39.040 --> 05:43.260
it and ask that question one more time, to see if we can work out exactly what went wrong,

05:43.260 --> 05:47.260
and to do that, I suggest we start with the person who made it all happen in the first place,

05:47.260 --> 05:52.260
Lilly Singh. So folks, without further ado, let's jump right into it.

05:52.260 --> 06:01.540
Wow guys, it's summer already. Gee, it's come around fast. Well, call me Nelly because it's hot in here.

06:01.540 --> 06:08.980
All this sun is making me reconsider my life choices, such as my daily routine. Maybe you should reconsider your life too.

06:08.980 --> 06:12.980
And think about ways to spruce it up. Have you noticed that you smell?

06:13.620 --> 06:20.140
You know what also smells? Well, now introducing Scentbird, my new favourite brand of all time,

06:20.140 --> 06:26.340
at least since my last video. When I go shopping looking for all my Gucci and Prada, my gold

06:26.340 --> 06:31.980
chains, cashmere sweaters, and my grey Poupon, I'm always on the lookout for the finest

06:31.980 --> 06:40.080
colognes, and I'm not talking about cities in North Rhine Westphalia, however, all these

06:40.080 --> 06:45.380
bottles are so large. And what to confine you to one long-term relationship? What if

06:45.380 --> 06:50.360
you want to sleep around? Well, Scentbird has you covered. They allow you to try up

06:50.360 --> 06:59.360
to three travel-side designer or niche fragrances for just $17 a month. $17! That's like 0.00056

06:59.360 --> 07:06.920
Bitcoin, or for all you normies out there, 0.0088 Ethereum. Scentbird has all the designer

07:06.920 --> 07:12.520
brands alongside cool other niche perfumes like Salt Air by Skyler, which really captures

07:12.520 --> 07:25.920
the airiness and saltiness of an atmosphere with a degree of salinity. The Amberwood Tinge

07:25.920 --> 07:30.120
Sign You're After You by Mercedes Benz, which captures the flavours of a man who always

07:30.120 --> 07:35.380
lives life in the fast lane, and always keeps 12 points on his license. And the subtle spice

07:35.380 --> 07:41.540
of number one, David's Perfume by David Debrick, for whenever you feel like a number one. I'm

07:41.540 --> 07:46.840
sorry ladies, please control yourselves. Don't mind me friends, I just put some David Debrick

07:46.840 --> 07:52.680
on me, and now everyone's getting excited. Huh, wait, where do they go? Anyhow, I know

07:52.680 --> 07:58.180
I said $17 a month earlier, but I'm going to make you a deal. My friend Mr. Scentbird

07:58.180 --> 08:02.260

55% off. Can you hear him too? Well, all you have to do is use my coupon code RightOpinion

08:17.260 --> 08:22.840
US and Canada. Because folks, if it don't make dollars, it don't make sense. Scentbird.

08:22.840 --> 08:24.840
They smell good.

08:53.380 --> 08:58.080
Lilly Singh created her channel towards the end of 2010, with the first presently viewable upload being a

08:58.080 --> 09:03.080
tutorial on how to tie a turban. Now it's not the first ever upload on her channel, we'll address that in a bit,

09:03.080 --> 09:07.080
but I think it's understandable why she has left this up as the first upload. Although obviously very different

09:07.080 --> 09:11.560
to the content she would subsequently garner fame from making, it represents a degree of cultural pride,

09:11.560 --> 09:16.240
and integrates Lilly's more outgoing personality into the content, with a description that sets up Lilly's

09:16.240 --> 09:20.520
purpose in the creation of this video, observing that there aren't a lot of tutorials that can deliver

09:20.560 --> 09:25.560
information in a helpful way, and so she decided to fill that gap. When Lilly first launched her channel,

09:25.560 --> 09:30.480
she tried a few avenues of content. There was music, including piano covers and rap remixes,

09:30.480 --> 09:35.200
there was some serious commentary, and there were vlogs. Now, none of these performed particularly badly,

09:35.200 --> 09:38.840
as a matter of fact, viewership was pretty consistent throughout the channel in its early stages.

09:38.840 --> 09:44.320
However, the best performing video was a comedy one Lilly had made titled Stop Punjabi Madness, and not too long after,

09:44.320 --> 09:49.080
she decided to take another shot at the funniest stuff, uploading a video named Official Guide to Brown Girls.

09:49.800 --> 09:53.920
Today I'm going to tell you, welcome to Suboma's official guide of how to deal with brown girls.

09:53.920 --> 09:57.480
So hold on tight, because you know it's going to be quite the emotional rollercoaster.

09:57.480 --> 10:00.320
What's cooking good looking?

10:00.320 --> 10:05.840
Obviously, much of its production value was very apt for that of 2010, but as personality, and even if some of the humor

10:05.840 --> 10:10.360
is very much of its time, it's rooted in that trademark relatability that she'd soon become known for.

10:10.360 --> 10:14.880
Additionally, even if a punchline or an edit didn't always land, there was no lack of comedic ambition,

10:14.920 --> 10:19.480
and it demonstrated that Lilly was prepared to throw the kitchen sink at the wall just to see what stuck,

10:19.480 --> 10:24.760
which can be a real asset to honing in your craft. After its publication, Official Guide to Brown Girls quickly

10:24.760 --> 10:29.840
garnered significantly more views than any other video on her channel at that time, possibly giving Lilly a hint to what

10:29.840 --> 10:36.640
the masses wanted, and so she obliged, uploading more sketch-based comedy to her channel in the coming months, and years.

10:36.640 --> 10:49.840
I swear to God, you have one job, and that's to be sucky. You can't even suck. You make the worst slut ever.

10:49.840 --> 10:54.640
Now in Lilly, there was no overnight success, particularly in the world of sketch comedy, which was already saturated by the

10:54.640 --> 11:00.040
early 2010s. Plenty of channels dominated the airwaves, and it was hard for any creator to put their foot in the door.

11:00.040 --> 11:05.120
But growth was steady, and enough of those who found her channel decided to subscribe and stick around for her content.

11:05.160 --> 11:10.480
Playing the waiting game isn't necessarily a bad option in this case, as it gave Lilly time to improve her skills and creative

11:10.480 --> 11:15.680
direction, improving viewer retention and subscriber conversion. This eventually began to pay dividends, particularly

11:15.680 --> 11:20.680
around the year 2013, where her content began to be treated very favourably by the YouTube algorithm.

11:20.680 --> 11:26.920
Starting the year on approximately 170,000 subscribers, she finished on 1.86 million, the sort of growth that many creators

11:26.920 --> 11:31.880
can only dream of. By then, Lilly was producing highly polished videos that captured the energy of her humour,

11:31.920 --> 11:37.320
or remaining sincere to the subject matter. She had fleshed out characters, running gags and social commentary from a defined

11:37.320 --> 11:43.120
persona that commanded a large fanbase of dedicated viewers. Maybe we'll ask exactly how she did it, well we already spoke

11:43.120 --> 11:48.360
about her appeal as a second generation daughter of migrants, but I think it went a little deeper than that. In the early 21st century,

11:48.360 --> 11:52.840
the age of the internet was dawning in many countries, which were certainly not used to having such contraption at their

11:52.840 --> 11:58.160
disposal. The internet gave young people in their formative years a lot of accessibility to ideas and media that they

11:58.160 --> 12:03.040
would never have had the chance to appreciate without the world wide web. However, a lot of this media came into very

12:03.040 --> 12:08.560
significant conflict with values held by older generations, those whose perspectives had been formed and cemented a long

12:08.560 --> 12:14.040
time ago, and who probably did not interact with that sort of media well. The conflict was the source of tension in a lot of

12:14.040 --> 12:19.920
families, and was very much documented for its time. In Lilly's case, her exposure to western culture was part of growing up in

12:19.920 --> 12:24.960
Canada, but all over the world, with the increasing access to the online world and social media, people were having the exact

12:24.960 --> 12:31.040
same experiences, ones that were encompassed by Lilly's content. In a 2012 interview, when asked about reasons for starting

12:31.040 --> 12:36.240
her channel, Lilly replied, one inspiration was definitely the fact that there was no female doing it, particularly an Indian

12:36.240 --> 12:41.680
female doing it. Lilly was right in way, although it's obviously an exaggeration to an extent. There were female comedians

12:41.680 --> 12:47.640
who uploaded to YouTube, and some who had accrued considerable success doing so, such as Jenna Marbles. Nonetheless, the lion's share

12:47.640 --> 12:53.240
of the market was controlled by male led channels. It's nothing against those channels, but there's only so many people you can

12:53.240 --> 12:59.240
appeal to from that angle that many of those creators were making videos from. If Ian and Anthony from Smosh began to upload

12:59.240 --> 13:04.680
content and wanted to be a brown girl, I think viewers would be understandably confused, but for a long time, people would

13:04.680 --> 13:11.120
interpret that lack of representation as a lack of demand in a certain market. Yet by the end of 2014, Lilly's channel,

13:11.120 --> 13:18.040
iiSuperwomanii, possessed just shy of 5 million subscribers, over 80% of whom were female, with many likely from a diverse

13:18.040 --> 13:23.440
range of ethnic backgrounds. Those sorts of statistics spoke volumes. Nevertheless, Lilly's successes were also being

13:23.440 --> 13:29.000
recognised outside of her subscriber count. 2014 brought her nominations for both the Shorty and Streamy Awards,

13:29.000 --> 13:34.040
collaborations with renowned celebrities, a multitude of interviews where she detailed her background and rise to stardom,

13:34.040 --> 13:40.000
and regular guest spots at popular conventions. Coming off the year, Singh appeared in the 2014 rewind amongst many of the

13:40.000 --> 13:45.920
platform's then largest creators, cementing her status as YouTube royalty. It was clear that on her current trajectory, she was

13:45.920 --> 13:51.560
destined to be one of the website's leading lights. However, some of Lilly's ambition was never going to be merely settled on

13:51.560 --> 13:57.680
what she had, and heading into 2015, it was clear she had greater plans. In her time as a content creator, she had appeared in a few

13:57.680 --> 14:03.240
films and music videos, particularly those in Indian media, which although not major, definitely reflected her desire to expand

14:03.240 --> 14:08.640
into the mainstream industry as a whole. As early uploads on her channel showed, she had always had the hunger for all types of

14:08.640 --> 14:14.560
creative content, and now she was about to fully realise it. Lilly Singh was about to go global.

14:16.920 --> 14:25.920
In the space of a few years, Lilly Singh had built a YouTube empire, but it's clear that she wanted more, and who could blame her?

14:25.920 --> 14:34.160
Lilly Singh- I'm gonna take you all on a trip to Unicorn Island with my first ever world tour!

14:34.160 --> 14:39.520
The thing about YouTube is that success is fleeting for most creators, there are exceptions, and likely people who will remain on

14:39.520 --> 14:44.920
YouTube for a rather long time to come, people who enjoy their work here. But for many who want more from the entertainment

14:44.920 --> 14:51.000
world, YouTube is just the start. This was definitely the case for Lilly Singh. In March 2015, she embarked on a world tour

14:51.000 --> 14:56.440
called A Trip to Unicorn Island, which integrated her various talents and interests into one comprehensive performance.

14:56.440 --> 15:02.080
Now tours are certainly not out of the ordinary for a creator of her size, however, she also decided to chronicle this circuit with a

15:02.080 --> 15:07.360
documentary feature film which shared its name with the tour itself. It was released the following year to mix reviews from

15:07.360 --> 15:13.040
critics and audiences, but was likely well received by her devotees as a raw glimpse into the person behind the entertainer,

15:13.080 --> 15:18.760
including covering the struggles of content creation. Throughout the year, she began to win awards and receive more coverage

15:18.760 --> 15:24.480
from various mainstream media outlets. She won a Streamy and an MTV Fandom Award, and made the top 10 on Forbes' highest

15:24.480 --> 15:29.960
earning YouTube stars of that year. This was the perfect time to eye up Hollywood, which was exactly what she was doing.

15:29.960 --> 15:37.160
In a 2015 LA Times interview, Singh stated that she intended to move to La La Land by November. She doesn't state why, but I think we

15:37.160 --> 15:42.280
can make a reasonable assumption it wasn't for the affordable housing. Come the new year, it's what she had done, and not too

15:42.280 --> 15:46.280
soon after, she began to increasingly appear across the entertainment industry as a whole.

16:06.280 --> 16:11.720
With Lea's success, it wasn't hard to understand why she was so sought after. She commanded a large fanbase who would readily

16:11.720 --> 16:16.920
watch whatever she was credited just to point her out, she had a proven record of being able to hold her own as a performer,

16:16.920 --> 16:22.360
and she was some of the hottest product on the scene at the time. However, Hollywood was a very different can of worms to YouTube,

16:22.360 --> 16:27.400
and whereas Lily was one of the largest influencers at the time on the video sharing platform, she was still a relatively small

16:27.400 --> 16:33.080
fish in Hollywood. Many creatives had pioneered the industry before her, and her experience, although no less inherently

16:33.080 --> 16:37.840
meaningful, was set against an industry full of people who had already broken the ground that she walked on.

16:37.840 --> 16:44.400
YouTube had been around for just over a decade, Hollywood had existed for over a century. With this in mind, although you'd

16:44.400 --> 16:49.680
certainly be impressed to read a repertoire of her media appearances, she never made any performances that felt particularly

16:49.680 --> 16:55.760
memorable. Her roles weren't derisory by any means, but they didn't represent that guarantee of longevity that so many budding

16:55.760 --> 17:01.840
stars aspired for. One of the most promising prospects was an NBC show by the name of Bright Futures, which was set to have

17:02.000 --> 17:08.080
and another YouTube breakout star, Jimmy Tatro, playing young friends all attempting to realise their careers. Unfortunately, this

17:08.080 --> 17:12.480
was scrapped not too long after it was conceived, serving a rather bitter blow to those involved.

17:12.480 --> 17:18.480
We'd seen it before, a YouTuber goes to Hollywood, manages a few minor speaking roles in studio productions, and then mostly

17:18.480 --> 17:23.520
fades away when the novelty of their presence wears off, and after the first few acting roles, there probably were those who

17:23.520 --> 17:28.040
wondered if Lily Singh would be assigned to the same category, but there were signs this wasn't the case.

17:28.040 --> 17:30.520
I love who I am, and that's when I decide I'm a boss.

17:30.520 --> 17:32.520
Yeah, see?

17:32.520 --> 17:39.240
In March 2017, she published her first autobiography, How To Be A Boss, A Guide To Conquering Life.

17:39.240 --> 17:45.480
Going off the synopsis, it looks like a crash course in fulfilling Maslow's pyramids of needs. However, that's not necessarily a bad

17:45.480 --> 17:50.600
thing, and a lot of people seem to agree, boring itself to the number one spot on the New York Times bestseller list.

17:50.600 --> 17:55.720
She hosted a successful world tour to promote the book, all while continuing to work on her projects for her YouTube channel and

17:56.360 --> 18:00.600
Although she hadn't quite defined her career yet, it felt like she was on the right trajectory.

18:00.600 --> 18:05.000
I'd say the most important aspect of her status in Hollywood was that of a public figure in general.

18:05.000 --> 18:10.600
As her old content had layered more social commentary than a lot of her contemporaries, she carried more social clout than a lot of

18:10.600 --> 18:16.360
other YouTube figures who had tried to change lanes. Her history of being outspoken regarding many causes, including mental

18:16.360 --> 18:21.560
health, the treatment of women, and the representation of marginalized groups in media, had garnered her the reputation that

18:21.560 --> 18:27.160
she could be a good ambassador for many noble causes. It meant people often wanted to listen to what she had to say, and her

18:27.160 --> 18:33.960
success only emboldened this observation. In 2017, she became a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador, a role occupied by celebrities

18:33.960 --> 18:40.120
such as David Beckham, Katy Perry, and Jackie Chan. Singh's role specialized in advocating for children's rights, and she

18:40.120 --> 18:42.120
addressed the United Nations the following year.

18:42.120 --> 18:50.360
Now getting to where I am today and achieving this level of success was not easy, but when I compare myself to the circumstances

18:50.360 --> 18:57.560
of what the majority of young people face, to be honest, I feel like I practically won the lottery. I got to receive an

18:57.560 --> 19:05.080
education, I got support, I didn't have to face obstacles such as poverty, conflict, or failed institutions.

19:05.080 --> 19:10.760
She also used this authority to represent the online world and their often divisive sense of humor, tickling countries that

19:10.760 --> 19:16.360
weren't necessarily the most free speech oriented. It was clear that Lily meant business. She began to acquire a fair few roles

19:16.360 --> 19:22.760
that didn't necessarily rely on comedy, but more on her own natural self and background. She collaborated with Smashbox Cosmetics,

19:22.760 --> 19:28.760
Calvin Klein, Ardennes, and Pantene just to name a few, and appeared alongside many other famous females in Maroon 5's song

19:28.760 --> 19:34.840
Girls Like You. With creators from the world of YouTube, there was a sense that many just wouldn't translate into being engaging

19:34.840 --> 19:41.320
celebrities, and sometimes that was the case, but Lily was a departure from that. Her roles in film and TV didn't seem like they

19:41.320 --> 19:46.120
were going to make her a star in their own rights, but as she became more ingrained in Hollywood culture, her

19:46.120 --> 19:51.240
status as an outgoing person who could hold a friendly conversation, but also deliver some strong social messaging,

19:51.240 --> 19:57.000
provided her with a different kind of appeal, one that did transcend most fleeting pop culture bullshit, and with that sort of

19:57.000 --> 20:01.640
brand and the proven success that had come with it, there was a genre that seemed like a good fit.

20:01.640 --> 20:05.160
Welcome to the Late Late Show everybody.

20:05.160 --> 20:06.200
Let's talk about it.

20:06.200 --> 20:16.920
Talk shows are a genre that I've addressed before. Although I focus more on the daytime genre rather than nights, they do share a lot of

20:16.920 --> 20:22.760
similarities, so I don't want to repeat myself too much. However, besides the obvious aesthetic differences, I'd say late night

20:22.760 --> 20:28.840
talk shows play off a stricter blueprint than a lot of their daytime counterparts. Now, there is variety, and each late night host

20:28.840 --> 20:34.040
has their own personal flair, but most played a pretty safe game as long as the numbers they pulled were satisfactory enough.

20:34.040 --> 20:39.160
Another key difference I'd say about late night talk show hosts is that many of them leaned into social commentary more

20:39.160 --> 20:44.520
heavily than their daytime counterparts, being able to dispense an opinion on a controversial matter was becoming

20:44.520 --> 20:49.480
increasingly sought after, especially in a world where current affairs were becoming more and more emotionally provocative

20:49.480 --> 20:55.480
subjects. In the past few decades, the media industry in general has increasingly diversified its roster of figureheads,

20:55.480 --> 21:01.000
however with a few exceptions, late night talk shows have mostly remained dominated by a very specific type of person.

21:01.000 --> 21:05.320
It's also important to note that many of these hosts had been on the air for over a decade, and although there's nothing

21:05.320 --> 21:10.680
wrong with the media stalwart, by the end of the 2010s there was a huge untapped demographic, as a majority of younger

21:10.680 --> 21:16.520
generations were consuming content from sources outside of cable TV. Now, late night talk shows had long held

21:16.520 --> 21:22.760
their own on YouTube. As a matter of fact, Lilly Singh's appearances on 2014 and 2015 Rewind were alongside a fair few

21:22.760 --> 21:28.040
late night hosts as well. This is in part because of YouTube's long-standing relationship with late night TV. NBC

21:28.040 --> 21:33.160
partnered with YouTube in 2006, and some credit the variety of late night clips as playing a role in Google's

21:33.160 --> 21:38.440
acquisition of YouTube. To this day, many major networks have contracts with the video sharing platform for monetization

21:38.440 --> 21:43.480
and adsense, with network executives viewing YouTube as a distribution partner, and with some channels scoring up to

21:43.480 --> 21:49.400
250 million views a month, it's hard to see it as anything else. As noted, late night talk shows have always

21:49.400 --> 21:54.760
coasted off the individual personality more than a lot of other broadcasts. The rancors were able to build a rapport

21:54.760 --> 21:59.320
with the live audience and YouTube viewer alike, and although you'd be hard pressed to say they had the sort of

21:59.320 --> 22:04.600
relationship with their subscribers that many content creators did, there were obvious parallels, and their presence

22:04.600 --> 22:09.720
on the YouTube platform was notably greater than other TV programs. However, in spite of its popularity on the

22:09.720 --> 22:15.080
video sharing platform, the genre was still mostly removed from YouTube in its presentation, still playing to what

22:15.080 --> 22:20.440
they knew best. For a lot of late night talk shows, that sort of stability in a highly competitive industry was

22:20.520 --> 22:25.560
something the executive valued, but even after the ratings spike that the election of Donald Trump provided them,

22:25.560 --> 22:30.600
there were still signs that current popularity was waning a little. Late night needed a fresh face on the scene.

22:30.600 --> 22:35.640
YouTube was a good litmus test for what the market enjoyed without the boardrooms and arbitrations.

22:35.640 --> 22:40.840
It was like a mass focus group, if the right kind of figure on YouTube could hold down their entire channel,

22:40.840 --> 22:42.840
then who knows what else they could be capable of.

22:42.840 --> 22:51.080
They don't know you, how giant you are on YouTube. 7.6 million subscribers, over 1 billion views. 1 billion.

22:52.360 --> 23:00.600
You were named in Forbes 30 under 30, and you just did a worldwide tour, 27 cities and 31 shows. Congratulations, pal.

23:00.600 --> 23:02.840
Thank you so much, thank you. Well done.

23:02.840 --> 23:07.480
Lee Singh seemed like the prime candidate for that sort of role. She had a proven record on YouTube and in

23:07.480 --> 23:12.200
Hollywood, not just as an entertainer and a comedian, but also as a person whose words held relative value

23:12.200 --> 23:16.360
in their circles, who would intertwine that social commentary with those amusing anecdotes.

23:16.360 --> 23:20.760
The increasing diversification of the market around her, yet the lack of representation on the late night

23:20.760 --> 23:25.880
circuit left a comfortable niche for her to fill. However, that opening would need to present itself first.

23:25.880 --> 23:32.040
But that was just around the corner. The year is 2019, and NBC were just wrapping up the long-term

23:32.040 --> 23:36.920
talk show Last Call with Carson Daly. Daly wished to focus on his other TV projects more, and felt

23:36.920 --> 23:41.800
that the talk show had run its course after 17 rather fruitful years. The NBC chairman sensed

23:41.800 --> 23:46.520
an opportunity, stating to interviewers that he saw the time slot's potential to become a creative

23:46.520 --> 23:51.400
playground, which would focus more on relevancy in the digital age. The alleged first choice of

23:51.400 --> 23:56.760
the studio was Chrissy Teigen, but she declined, and not too long after, the producer of Conan,

23:56.760 --> 24:00.680
John Irwin, proposed Singh as a possible replacement, citing her ability to balance

24:00.680 --> 24:04.920
comedy and serious commentary. Lilly had previously appeared with Conan, so Irwin seemed like a

24:04.920 --> 24:09.480
reasonable enough source, and with this in mind, NBC approached Singh, and together with her company

24:09.480 --> 24:14.280
Unicorn Island Productions, began to plan out what would become A Little Late with Lilly Singh.

24:14.280 --> 24:18.520
The MO was clear, the political commentary of many talk show hosts had taken up enough space,

24:18.520 --> 24:22.760
so Lilly would supposedly be replicating what had made her YouTube channel such a success,

24:22.760 --> 24:27.320
the comedic portrayal and narrative surrounding her experiences and unique background. On paper,

24:27.320 --> 24:31.400
this made a lot of sense, I said that earlier Ian and Anthony from Smosh couldn't speak about their

24:31.400 --> 24:36.600
experiences as a brown girl, well neither could Jimmy Fallon, Stephen Colbert, or James Corden,

24:36.600 --> 24:40.360
and the fact was that the format of late night shows allowed narratives to be based around the

24:40.360 --> 24:44.440
host, and Singh should have been able to bring some fresh perspectives to what was then a very

24:44.440 --> 24:50.200
tired genre. When news of this broke, it was met with hope, intrigue, and some skepticism, for many

24:50.200 --> 24:54.280
Lilly represented a new generation of talk show hosts, she was the first ever late night presenter

24:54.280 --> 24:58.920
to openly identify as bisexual, hell on announcement she was going to be the only female

24:58.920 --> 25:03.240
heading up a major late night program, and even though she wasn't the first, this news was met

25:03.240 --> 25:07.240
with praise by many who felt that the current register of TV hosts left a fair bit to be

25:07.240 --> 25:11.640
desired. For some, regardless of what she said, Lilly Singh was already going to be a breath of

25:11.640 --> 25:16.600
fresh air in an atmosphere that for some had grown very stale. However, although many welcomed this

25:16.600 --> 25:21.240
news, there was still an air of uncertainty as to whether her signature flair would translate into

25:21.240 --> 25:25.400
such a format. It was true that there were a lot of similarities between being the face of a YouTube

25:25.400 --> 25:29.640
channel and being the face of a talk show, but there was also one key difference, that being

25:29.640 --> 25:34.360
talk shows are just much higher production value, and although that can often be a positive facet,

25:34.360 --> 25:39.240
can sacrifice the homegrown charm and spontaneity of a YouTube channel. Lilly would have a full

25:39.240 --> 25:43.640
camera crew, script writers, producers, and she did obviously have her own studio involved as

25:43.640 --> 25:47.480
well, but there was the lingering question of how much she could make the talk show her own

25:47.480 --> 25:52.360
with so many other hands involved. Lilly showed that she could make it into Hollywood, but she

25:52.360 --> 25:56.760
never did it using the exact same skill set that had garnered her a following on YouTube.

25:56.760 --> 26:02.120
The news that she would be utilising that YouTube basis once more could be for better or for worse,

26:02.120 --> 26:06.440
but at this stage one could only speculate. In this case, the proof of the pudding was

26:06.440 --> 26:12.200
in the eating. But did people have the appetite for it? Well, there was only one way to find out.

26:22.360 --> 26:30.280
On the 12th September, a channel by the name of A Little Late with Lilly Singh posted a YouTube

26:30.280 --> 26:35.560
video titled How Lilly Singh Really Built Her Show. It fabricates a rather far-fetched story

26:35.560 --> 26:39.720
about the origins of A Little Late, but drops the necessary details that would be required to

26:39.720 --> 26:43.800
understand the show. It also provides an impression of the sort of sketches that Lilly might be

26:43.800 --> 27:09.400
performing. It definitely integrates some of her commentary elements from her videos,

27:09.400 --> 27:13.400
but seems to do it more in a running narrative format, whereas in the past her commentary for

27:13.400 --> 27:17.800
content had felt more like a voiceover. This style seemed to aim to assimilate the two more,

27:17.800 --> 27:22.120
and overall viewers seemed to enjoy it with many devotees commenting their appreciation.

27:22.120 --> 27:26.280
It was only a day later that NBC actually released a preview on their own network,

27:26.280 --> 27:30.280
showing that Lilly clearly still valued using YouTube as a platform, and it should have been

27:30.280 --> 27:35.560
a sign of good things to come. A Little Late with Lilly Singh made its debut on the 16th September

27:35.560 --> 27:40.040
with an opening monologue that touched on her heritage, her background, and her status amongst

27:40.040 --> 27:43.560
many other late-night hosts who she was sharing the scene with. Lilly Singh- Look, I get it,

27:43.560 --> 27:48.360
okay? I'm not your traditional talk show host. I mean, the media has mentioned I'm a bisexual

27:48.360 --> 27:53.400
woman of colour so much that I feel like I should just change my name. A little long,

27:53.400 --> 27:59.480
but it has a nice ring to it. Come on, I'm more than just a bisexual woman of colour, okay? It's

27:59.480 --> 28:05.080
a complete coincidence that I chose a network whose logo is also the Pride flag. The set seems

28:05.080 --> 28:09.560
almost designed to create the atmosphere of a late-night comedy club, one which places Lilly

28:09.560 --> 28:13.080
at the forefront of the stand-up scene as she delivers jokes that wouldn't seem out of place

28:13.080 --> 28:17.560
for that sort of environment. Alongside her gags, visual aids appeared on screen for viewers to

28:17.560 --> 28:21.640
provide some additional humour, though sometimes it felt a bit on the nose for what it was trying

28:21.640 --> 28:27.800
to explain. Lilly- I mean, real talk, if you put every network late-night host in one room together,

28:28.440 --> 28:33.640
and then add me and Hasan Minhaj, we look like the IT department at their law firm's customs party.

28:34.600 --> 28:38.520
This format was accompanied by interviews, the first episodes being with writer and actor Mindy

28:38.520 --> 28:43.480
Kaling, though Office co-star Rainn Wilson makes a brief appearance too. Alongside some sketches,

28:43.480 --> 28:48.920
most notably one baptised Lilly Singh Knocks Down the Door of Late Night, which featured Lilly

28:48.920 --> 28:52.920
performing one of her signature raps, explaining why she is not like other late-night talk show

28:52.920 --> 28:55.080
hosts, all while girl-bossing it to the top.

28:55.080 --> 29:03.640
Lilly- Hello my name is Lilly, and I ain't a white man. My skin got some colour, and it ain't a spray tan.

29:03.640 --> 29:09.800
I know you're used to only jimmies in the spotlight, but I'ma throw some melanin up in your late night.

29:09.800 --> 29:13.960
Alongside the release of this first episode was a flurry of promotional campaigns, including

29:13.960 --> 29:17.800
appearances on other late-night TV shows. She could do this as unlike other late-night hosts,

29:17.800 --> 29:22.200
her shows weren't actually broadcast live, and had all been pre-recorded to fit in with her hectic

29:22.200 --> 29:25.880
schedule. Overall, the promotional campaign seemed to work, as the clips on her YouTube

29:25.880 --> 29:29.400
channel appeared to garner significant traction, but what would the reviews say?

29:29.400 --> 29:33.400
Well, many critics seemed to laud her fresh perspective and approach on late-night television,

29:33.400 --> 29:37.560
some going as far as to label it revolutionary. There were some critics who didn't enjoy a

29:37.560 --> 29:41.480
staccato interviewing style of Mindy, never really allowing the conversation to gather

29:41.480 --> 29:45.880
substantial flow, and some weren't a fan of certain YouTubisms that she had brought over.

29:46.680 --> 29:51.160
I start like, I'm being like, yeah, yeah, I was like that in high school too, you know,

29:51.160 --> 29:57.640
which is like not true at all. And even the like dorks in Euphoria would have been Miss America.

29:57.640 --> 30:02.200
They're so hot. No, 100% when I watch a show, I'm like, you're all so hot. You have two eyebrows,

30:02.200 --> 30:06.760
what's that about? I didn't have that in high school. I didn't have that at all.

30:06.760 --> 30:10.520
Now, critics aren't exactly the sort of people Lily was expecting to appease completely,

30:10.520 --> 30:13.960
and maybe some of these professional reviewers were just a bit too old to understand such

30:13.960 --> 30:18.600
aesthetic choices. The most important question pertained to what those on her native platform

30:18.600 --> 30:24.920
thought, the people who she was meant to appeal to. Well, it wasn't exactly unanimous positivity.

30:24.920 --> 30:28.120
Her opening monologue and sketch were the clips that attracted the most criticism,

30:28.120 --> 30:31.240
with many finding the humour too heavy-handed and repetitive.

30:38.760 --> 30:43.160
As you probably noticed, there are a few references to her unique status as a bisexual

30:43.160 --> 30:47.160
minority on the telly, and although that was a breath of fresh air in the current environment,

30:47.160 --> 30:51.960
some felt that it had become the basis for too many jokes, some of which seemed to imply that

30:51.960 --> 30:56.200
people would be offended to see someone of her ethnicity on stage, which doesn't really make

30:56.200 --> 31:00.680
sense given other figures that came before her. With this in mind, commenters seemed to feel that

31:00.680 --> 31:05.000
she was giving herself a bit too much credit, others just found the humour rather cringe,

31:05.000 --> 31:09.560
in particular rap, which despite being based on early YouTube content, didn't seem to land with

31:09.560 --> 31:14.120
the grace that those videos had done so before. It seems that those from mainstream media and

31:14.120 --> 31:18.360
those from YouTube both saw very different issues with Lilly Singh's show. Whereas some from the

31:18.360 --> 31:22.520
mainstream felt that certain technical choices didn't feel in keeping with late night talk shows

31:22.520 --> 31:26.600
at the time, many viewers just felt that the humour fell flat as a whole. Now we know that

31:26.600 --> 31:30.920
critics and audiences often look for different elements in media, that's why the scores can

31:30.920 --> 31:35.640
sometimes be extremely different. However, I think although both sects of the internet had their own

31:35.640 --> 31:40.120
qualms with the show, most would agree that the general critical consensus was far more positive

31:40.120 --> 31:44.920
than the audience one. Now many would argue that critical approach is much more important than the

31:44.920 --> 31:49.480
opinions of those on the internet, as critics do their job professionally, and many look towards

31:49.480 --> 31:54.520
critical reviews before making decisions on what shows to tune into. However, Lilly Singh's decision

31:54.520 --> 31:59.000
to make parts of her show immediately available to viewers online made much of the critical response

31:59.000 --> 32:03.560
redundant, as a YouTube clip could typically encompass an entire sketch, rather than a small

32:03.560 --> 32:08.280
segment from a film per se, a prospective audience member would be able to make a much more holistic

32:08.280 --> 32:11.960
judgement on whether this was something worth watching, and it was clear that for some that

32:11.960 --> 32:16.440
simply wasn't the case. Nonetheless, although YouTube comments and like dislike ratings can

32:16.440 --> 32:20.280
reflect the response of a certain audience, they don't have too much individual bearing on the

32:20.280 --> 32:24.440
well for every TV show. If certain viewers don't like it, they don't have to watch it.

32:24.440 --> 32:29.320
Maybe this show simply wasn't for them. However, that was not enough for some.

32:29.640 --> 32:36.440
I feel like a lot of people may be a little bit upset that the entire four minutes of this is just

32:37.080 --> 32:39.640
random jokes about race.

32:39.640 --> 32:42.760
And maybe Lilly's background was coming back to bite her.

32:48.520 --> 32:53.160
By 2019, there was quite a significant space on YouTube for media criticism in general.

32:53.160 --> 32:56.840
It was particularly popular with the rise of reaction-infused content in this genre,

32:56.840 --> 33:00.200
mainly due to the increasing accessibility of source material as a whole.

33:00.200 --> 33:04.440
Most of this originated from YouTube or other platforms such as TikTok, and normally entailed

33:04.440 --> 33:09.240
a commentator explaining which teen idol couldn't actually sing. However, this had also extended

33:09.240 --> 33:12.600
into the realm of talk shows in the past, particularly with the popularity of shows like

33:12.600 --> 33:16.840
Dr. Phil, who also held a relatively strong YouTube presence. Nevertheless, in spite of

33:16.840 --> 33:21.160
their often considerable view count, late night talk show hosts were never subject to too much

33:21.160 --> 33:26.040
commentary, mainly because of how inoffensive their core content was. Lilly Singh's content

33:26.040 --> 33:29.800
wasn't particularly offensive either, and in many ways, the negative response experienced

33:29.800 --> 33:33.560
to the first episode of her show could have been ephemeral, and yet it wasn't.

33:35.320 --> 33:39.240
In fact, over the following weeks, the widespread lampooning of many of the clips from her opening

33:39.240 --> 33:44.040
show went viral across the platform, mainly because of how many topical debates it seemed to hit.

33:44.040 --> 33:48.760
It's crazy, like it's very groundbreaking because, you know, it's always just been pasty white dudes,

33:48.760 --> 33:54.120
you know, that's always been the trend, it's always been that, and now it's like, finally, finally!

33:54.120 --> 33:57.240
And I don't think there would have been any buzz, I don't think anybody would have a problem with it,

33:57.240 --> 34:02.120
but her and her team made the big mistake of just making it all about that, making it all about her

34:02.120 --> 34:08.280
being a woman of color, like, look at me, and move over, move over, white people! It's the brown

34:08.280 --> 34:12.120
woman's gain now! There were obviously those who had a political angle on it, particularly

34:12.120 --> 34:16.520
with much of the human being identity-based, but videos on these subjects spanned across

34:16.520 --> 34:20.920
all genres. As noted, one of the major criticisms from online viewers was that Lilly's jokes were

34:20.920 --> 34:25.880
rather awkward, or cringe, which I think is a detail worth noting down, because as I'm sure we all know,

34:25.880 --> 34:30.440
as excruciating as it can be to watch, cringe is a great source of views for a lot of creators,

34:30.440 --> 34:35.560
even in a format as basic as cringe compilations, which are accompanied by no commentary whatsoever.

34:35.560 --> 34:36.520
THE VACCINE!

34:39.640 --> 34:41.080
Shut the fuck up.

34:41.080 --> 34:45.720
But let's be honest, a lot of late night shows have their unfunny moments, especially unfunny to

34:45.720 --> 34:49.640
a lot of netizens at least. Cringe comedy is off to the heart of a lot of these shows,

34:49.640 --> 34:53.160
what was so special about Lilly Singh? Well, there are a few reasons this became such a

34:53.160 --> 34:57.240
perfect storm of publicity. The first was simply because it was a new show on the block, whenever

34:57.240 --> 35:01.080
something new happens, there is always a gap in the market for those who react to it, so almost

35:01.080 --> 35:04.440
immediately there were a fair few videos that provided their thoughts on Lilly's new venture,

35:04.440 --> 35:08.840
most of which, as we know now, were not the most praising. From there on, it's a domino effect of

35:08.840 --> 35:13.160
reaction videos. Secondly, Lilly's choice to use YouTube as a platform to prioritize distribution

35:13.160 --> 35:17.080
of her content cut out the risk of certain negative, critical, or word-of-mouth opinions

35:17.080 --> 35:21.000
restricting viewership. However, this backfired because then people's only interest in watching

35:21.000 --> 35:25.640
reviews or reactions to her content was for entertainment purposes, which bolstered content

35:25.640 --> 35:29.880
taking the piss out of her show. Most people don't read critical reviews for entertainment,

35:29.880 --> 35:33.720
they will watch a YouTube video though, and they were available in spades.

35:33.720 --> 35:37.480
It's pretty generally accepted that negative content will attract more views as a whole,

35:37.480 --> 35:42.040
and is often the basis for more effective YouTube comedy, so it's little surprise that many aspiring

35:42.040 --> 35:46.600
comedians saw it as just that. Then you have to consider her status as a large YouTube figure,

35:46.600 --> 35:51.320
one that magnifies such relevance only further. For some mysterious reason, possibly related to

35:51.320 --> 35:56.040
view count, though I couldn't possibly say why, many YouTubers enjoy talking about other YouTubers

35:56.040 --> 36:00.440
more than they do people of other mediums, and a YouTuber trying their hand at something else?

36:00.440 --> 36:04.840
Oh well, that was a goldmine waiting to happen. However, one cannot blame environmental factors

36:04.840 --> 36:09.000
alone for the scrutiny that the show found itself under. Although it's fair to say that certain

36:09.000 --> 36:13.240
missteps would have probably been overlooked if they occurred elsewhere, they weren't here.

36:13.320 --> 36:17.880
So, Lily, for your first episode, we're thinking you enter in a nice grey suit.

36:17.880 --> 36:21.240
Grey? I prefer something a little more colourful, obviously.

36:21.240 --> 36:24.520
Yeah, so do I. I like a pink one. Oh, you mean...

36:27.000 --> 36:28.360
You don't mean it like that, do you?

36:28.360 --> 36:32.360
Lee Sing-e presents herself as a champion for those underrepresented in media. She obviously

36:32.360 --> 36:37.800
didn't explicitly say that, well, not too much, but by highlighting that aspect of her identity

36:37.800 --> 36:41.640
and positioning herself as a figure on social commentary, she placed herself in a role that

36:41.640 --> 36:45.320
was often held to quite rigorous standards. At the same time, she had built a lot of her

36:45.320 --> 36:49.080
success on jokes about her own race. Watching her shows always felt like she was trying to

36:49.080 --> 36:53.800
balance calling out certain stereotypes while also using them as joke fuel in other contexts.

36:53.800 --> 36:58.760
I am so happy to be here, and by the looks of it, a lot of you are happy to be here too.

36:59.960 --> 37:02.200
It's mostly the brown people because this was free to attend.

37:02.200 --> 37:05.240
Probably the most notable incident in the first month of airing was when she made a

37:05.240 --> 37:08.600
passing comment about towers on some children's heads resembling turbans.

37:09.000 --> 37:12.440
Their hair really quickly. So, you know, it's a very practical thing.

37:12.440 --> 37:15.560
I think they definitely had the turvy twist on when they...

37:18.280 --> 37:21.960
This part raised more backlash at the time and Sing-e quickly apologized for this. It's

37:21.960 --> 37:25.320
a sort of comment that probably would have flown under the radar on her YouTube channel,

37:25.320 --> 37:28.920
particularly given her Sikh background. But here, every joke that could be interpreted

37:28.920 --> 37:34.120
somewhat negatively was put under the magnifying glass. Even jokes that weren't necessarily her own,

37:34.120 --> 37:36.040
which caused some controversy in itself.

37:52.760 --> 37:57.480
This wasn't aided by the format of publication. With the traditional presentation of TV shows,

37:57.480 --> 38:01.000
reception would be quite linear, talk shows are a hard craft of effects,

38:01.080 --> 38:04.280
and it would be natural for someone's first episode to have a fair few hiccups.

38:04.280 --> 38:07.960
However, people's attention would quickly move on to the second episode when it's released.

38:07.960 --> 38:11.480
With YouTube, if a clip is notorious enough, it can provide discourse for months,

38:11.480 --> 38:15.480
and therefore YouTube will prioritize it in the algorithm. So even though there were many more

38:15.480 --> 38:19.320
clips uploaded to YouTube in the weeks after the first episode, people were still more likely to

38:19.320 --> 38:22.840
receive an impression from the content that had provoked the greatest reaction earlier,

38:22.840 --> 38:26.920
and although that may not have been representative of her shows, that was what was happening,

38:26.920 --> 38:31.880
and by mid-October discourse had manifested into this incessant dunking on a few select clips that

38:31.880 --> 38:35.800
were nearly a month old, but seemed to find new life every time a creator reacted to the

38:35.800 --> 38:40.280
war Lily made a faux pas. Her content was essentially experiencing a negative variety

38:40.280 --> 38:44.120
of sorts, with figures from all over the content spectrum chiming in on the matter.

38:44.120 --> 38:48.360
YouTube, the platform that had not just launched Lily's illustrious career, but had seemed central

38:48.360 --> 38:52.840
to the marketing of this new late-night venture, had seemingly reacted in the worst way possible,

38:52.840 --> 38:56.920
but Lily herself, a YouTube megastar, would surely understand this scenario,

38:56.920 --> 39:01.640
and know how to react accordingly, at least better than most Hollywood superstars, right?

39:02.280 --> 39:04.360
So, how would she respond?

39:04.360 --> 39:09.320
The reviews are from places like the Atlantic, Variety, CNN, Decider, Cosmopolitan, Deadline,

39:09.320 --> 39:12.520
whereas before there were negative reviews from like, Angry Virgins.

39:13.400 --> 39:13.900
Well.

39:19.960 --> 39:24.520
Now as noted, Lily's show was pre-recorded, therefore it would be fair to question if Lily

39:24.520 --> 39:29.080
could even adjust the objective of her broadcast on the basis of this response. Well you see,

39:29.080 --> 39:34.520
it was pre-recorded as aforementioned, but all in late 2019, so they were still recording after

39:34.520 --> 39:39.160
viewers watched and imparted their opinion of early episodes, and this did give Lily a platform

39:39.160 --> 39:43.160
to respond to those who found her humour cringe, or didn't approve of its messaging.

39:43.160 --> 39:45.080
So, how would she? Well.

40:02.680 --> 40:06.200
At first she didn't appear to be too bothered, mostly ignoring any criticism,

40:06.200 --> 40:10.520
unless it was proper controversy such as the turbo comment, however over time she did appear

40:10.520 --> 40:14.760
to be paying more attention to what people said. At first mocking the comments in the above clip,

40:14.760 --> 40:19.240
but barely a few days after that episode had aired, Lily took to Twitter in a rather sour mood.

40:19.240 --> 40:21.320
Her tweet on October 22nd read,

40:36.200 --> 40:41.960
In a way this statement isn't entirely false, we've seen a lot of creators

40:41.960 --> 40:46.680
consumed by negativity because of the topics of their content, if you deal with the worst people,

40:46.680 --> 40:51.640
sometimes you begin to see the worst in people. However, I think the problem is that this seemed

40:51.640 --> 40:57.000
like a passive aggressive response to the people criticising, or making fun of her show, which

40:57.000 --> 41:01.480
for a lot of people, really was not that deep. Now Lily is entitled to say whatever she wished

41:01.480 --> 41:05.400
to say, but she must have had some grasp on how this would provoke further response,

41:05.400 --> 41:08.920
and just like clockwork it did, because if there's one type of person on the internet

41:08.920 --> 41:13.720
loves to dunk on more than people trying to be funny but being cringe, it's people who can't

41:13.720 --> 41:17.960
take criticism, and Lily seemed like one of those people right then, with many providing

41:17.960 --> 41:21.560
recent responses to distinguishing hate from legitimate criticism.

41:21.560 --> 41:25.640
She goes on a big rant about why drama channels are bad, and she actually finishes the tweet with

41:25.640 --> 41:30.120
a message to the only people who can stand her content. Young kids, don't follow this example,

41:30.120 --> 41:33.560
it's not good for the soul or the longevity of your career, don't make me do it Lily,

41:33.560 --> 41:36.840
you're really tempting me here, don't make me shorten my own career span.

41:36.840 --> 41:41.240
I think her replies annoy people in the way that it almost demonstrated a lack of understanding

41:41.240 --> 41:45.480
in how YouTube operated and thrived, which as a former YouTuber you'd think she would

41:45.480 --> 41:49.640
have an abundance of. Sure, the website had evolved in the years since Lily had pursued

41:49.640 --> 41:54.120
her Hollywood dreams, but it still operated on the same tenets that she had found success with.

41:54.120 --> 41:58.680
Most of the viewers who watched her content and supported her career didn't just disappear from

41:58.680 --> 42:03.160
the platform, they hadn't been consumed by the negativity, they just no longer followed

42:03.160 --> 42:07.560
her with the same enthusiasm they had in the past. This response may have been one that was

42:07.560 --> 42:11.240
rooted in frustration at public response to her content, she clearly didn't feel it was

42:11.240 --> 42:15.480
representative of the show as a whole, and she probably had a point, but rather than just

42:15.480 --> 42:19.720
suggesting that people watch more of the show, it was almost a tit for tat, she had to cherry

42:19.720 --> 42:23.080
pick responses and strawman perspectives to get even with her haters.

42:23.080 --> 42:43.320
But

42:43.320 --> 42:47.960
maybe she did know, maybe she did realise that this was the sort of response that such statements

42:47.960 --> 42:52.840
would provoke. Perhaps in a way she saw the online criticism as potential free promotion for future

42:52.840 --> 42:56.920
episodes. This theory would make sense in a way because every time the coverage on YouTube had

42:56.920 --> 43:01.000
the potential to die a death, Lily would make some sort of public acknowledgement of it, and creators

43:01.000 --> 43:04.840
would feel inclined to issue further responses, probably the most notable one of these coming

43:04.840 --> 43:09.320
from a creator by the name of Drew Gooden, whose video Leaving the YouTube Bubble has amassed over

43:09.320 --> 43:13.720
15 million views, and is the second most viewed video on his channel. That's a lot of people

43:13.720 --> 43:17.880
talking about Lily Singh, I think you could easily look at many of the late night controversies and

43:17.880 --> 43:22.200
think that actually sometimes leaning into the controversial side of you can generate a lot of

43:22.200 --> 43:26.280
views. Hell, it had worked pretty successfully for some late night hosts whose views had stagnated

43:26.280 --> 43:38.680
at points. Some would argue that this was just modern day marketing, that as long as people were

43:38.680 --> 43:43.080
talking about her she had done her job, and for a while it obviously worked. However, I think the

43:43.080 --> 43:47.480
point of farming criticism is that it really depends who you're farming it from. With other late

43:47.480 --> 43:51.320
night hosts, a lot of their content received negative attention from people who were never

43:51.320 --> 43:55.480
going to watch their show anyway, particularly given the fact that they often utilised political

43:55.480 --> 43:59.560
topics that were designed to be divisive. With Lily, some of the criticism was coming

43:59.560 --> 44:03.960
from her own target audience, and much of it wasn't merely based on her political opinions.

44:03.960 --> 44:08.200
Now, a fair few criticisms towards Lily were politically motivated, especially people who

44:08.200 --> 44:12.440
felt her humour was racist, but there were a lot of general criticisms as well relating to

44:12.440 --> 44:17.160
presentation and execution of the show, criticisms that I don't think would have necessarily existed

44:17.160 --> 44:20.840
if they weren't issues to begin with. Additionally, even some politically motivated

44:20.840 --> 44:25.000
criticisms came from audiences who you'd think would appreciate her more progressive sense of

44:25.000 --> 44:29.000
humour, particularly those who felt she was appropriating certain cultures, or that her

44:29.000 --> 44:33.560
self-deprecating humour perpetuated negative stereotypes. I think the problem was that many

44:33.560 --> 44:37.800
of those who were critical were viewers who could have been won over if the show was managed

44:37.800 --> 44:42.360
correctly. In that sense, Lily's response did not invite them to watch further. But what about those

44:42.360 --> 44:47.240
who were invited? I've been an on-camera audience member a couple of times for this similar type of

44:47.240 --> 44:51.480
show, so that's why I felt I was qualified to review the show in this way. I feel I have a

44:51.480 --> 44:56.200
good understanding of what's a normal use of the applause sign, what's a normal use of a warm-up

44:56.200 --> 45:00.360
in the beginning, what's a normal amount of production, crew involvement, taping, etc.

45:00.360 --> 45:05.000
General things that most shows like this need, and I can honestly say that I was surprised by

45:05.000 --> 45:09.160
how overproduced A Little Late with Lily Singh is. A good video on this was published by the

45:09.160 --> 45:13.640
YouTuber Swell Entertainment, named I Was A Little Late with Lily Singh Audience Member.

45:13.640 --> 45:17.640
Swell details the experience of being in the audience on multiple occasions, delivers some

45:17.640 --> 45:21.400
technical criticism of the show, and imparts some anecdotes from her time at the studio.

45:21.400 --> 45:26.200
Riko started talking to me before the taping of the second episode. He was not shy about the fact

45:26.200 --> 45:30.920
that he knew all the crew, and that he was in fact working for the show. He said he had attended so

45:30.920 --> 45:35.000
many tapings that Lily had taken notice, and offered to try and find him a job for the show.

45:35.000 --> 45:39.240
He told me that his job varied, but for the most part it boiled down to him being in fact

45:39.240 --> 45:43.800
a paid audience member. Lily doesn't seem to have a problem with people knowing that Riko

45:43.800 --> 45:45.720
works on the show as an audience member.

45:52.600 --> 45:54.360
Aside from when the show is actually being taped,

46:05.240 --> 46:12.920
however, the most interesting information comes towards the end of the video, when she mentions

46:12.920 --> 46:17.480
the presence of NBC executives, and the tension it caused at the studio, particularly regarding

46:17.480 --> 46:19.160
Lily Singh's monologue subjects.

46:19.160 --> 46:23.560
Lily's monologue became a Twitter moment because she did a whole monologue talking about being

46:23.560 --> 46:28.600
bisexual woman, and how she had come out about a year prior, and how no one should get to dictate

46:28.600 --> 46:32.680
how much she talks about being a bi woman of color, and I'm conflicted on this. If it was

46:32.680 --> 46:36.440
an earlier episode, I would have applauded you for the statement, because then I would have known

46:36.440 --> 46:41.000
that, okay stand your ground, see how it goes over, and then if it doesn't work out, clearly

46:41.000 --> 46:45.720
me standing my ground is not keeping people watching, and it's not helping reviews. People

46:45.720 --> 46:49.720
don't care that I'm standing my ground. They still don't think the jokes are funny. They don't like

46:49.720 --> 46:53.240
the games. They don't like the interviews. They don't want x, y, and z. They think the show should

46:53.240 --> 46:57.960
be canceled. I would have known that you would have had time to adjust, and you know grow as a

46:57.960 --> 47:03.080
show, and grow as a late night host. However, I know that this was the fourth to last episode

47:03.080 --> 47:08.680
that was recorded, and I know that this was one of four episodes that I attended over the span of

47:08.680 --> 47:12.920
three months, and I'll tell you something, Lily. I saw zero growth in that time.

47:12.920 --> 47:16.840
The impression was that Lily wasn't really interested in adjusting her scope on the basis

47:16.840 --> 47:22.360
of the criticism, and on that basis, the show was staring down a rather imminent cancellation.

47:22.360 --> 47:26.440
A Little Late with Lily Singh is not your YouTube channel. You're on the top of the food chain at

47:26.440 --> 47:30.200
your YouTube channel. For your channel, you have people that work for you. You are in charge of

47:30.200 --> 47:35.000
them. Over at Siren Studios where A Little Late with Lily Singh is filmed, sure you are also in

47:35.000 --> 47:39.000
charge over there. The thing is though is that that's not your building. It's NBC's building.

47:39.000 --> 47:44.040
Your show is not on your YouTube channel. It's on NBC's network, and their slot, and they get to

47:44.040 --> 47:48.760
decide whether or not they renew or cancel your show. The fact that they placed you at Siren

47:48.760 --> 47:53.960
Studios away from NBC Studios alone should show you that you are erasable. If you're not making

47:53.960 --> 47:57.560
them stupid amounts of money, they will just get rid of your show. It doesn't matter what

47:57.560 --> 48:02.680
The Atlantic or CNN says about you, because the critics are not the people watching 90%

48:02.680 --> 48:06.920
of the time, and your viewership is dwindling, and I don't know what else to say.

48:06.920 --> 48:09.400
But enough speculative talk. What actually happened?

48:09.400 --> 48:13.960
Lily, I hope NBC gives A Little Late with Lily Singh a second chance. I don't think they will,

48:13.960 --> 48:17.640
but if they do, I think you need to look at the possibility of needing to do a rebrand. But it's

48:17.640 --> 48:21.560
also pointless for me to say that because you getting a second season will just re-establish

48:21.560 --> 48:25.720
in your mind that, oh, what I've been doing is fine, because clearly that's what got me a second

48:25.720 --> 48:29.640
season, so I just need to keep doing what I've been doing. Lily, you're not the first person who

48:29.640 --> 48:32.840
has tried to do something outside of YouTube, and the reason a lot of them are able to start

48:32.840 --> 48:37.480
to try and do that is because they have what can get them in the door. They've got the well-known

48:37.480 --> 48:41.080
face, they've got the numbers, but they don't have what it takes to keep them in the room.

48:41.080 --> 48:42.600
Show me why you deserve to stay here.

48:52.520 --> 48:56.840
As the first season progressed, the ratings were overall reported to be consistent with the final

48:56.840 --> 49:01.640
season of Carson Daly, which some may have cited as reason to consider the show an overall triumph.

49:01.640 --> 49:05.560
However, considering that this was touted as a show that was breaking down walls and tearing

49:05.560 --> 49:09.720
up the late night scene as we know it, considering how much publicity the debut season of this show

49:09.720 --> 49:14.280
received in comparison to the final one of Carson Daly, it would be hard not to find such data

49:14.280 --> 49:18.600
somewhat disappointing for what it was trying to do. This was a person who could command a channel

49:18.600 --> 49:22.840
that would regularly pull in millions of viewers a video, someone who was meant to be going toe to

49:22.840 --> 49:27.080
toe with the late night jimmies, and yet in spite of all the controversy, the performance felt

49:27.080 --> 49:31.880
surprisingly tame. With all this in mind, it felt like Lily's route in addressing all that transpired

49:31.880 --> 49:35.880
had brought attention to the show, but not necessarily the right kind. Although videos

49:35.880 --> 49:40.200
criticising her had brought in plenty of views, much of the content didn't drive people towards

49:40.200 --> 49:44.440
this new network backed venture, likely leaving some to wonder whether this risky project would

49:44.440 --> 49:49.000
be able to maintain such ratings when online coverage died down. Would it even be worth the

49:49.000 --> 49:54.280
second season all things considered? Well, going off what I've said so far, I wouldn't blame you

49:54.280 --> 49:57.720
for being under the impression that this would have been the end of the late night circuit for

49:57.720 --> 50:02.440
Lily Singh. If NBC were hoping that this would be the gambit that paid off, it hadn't really returned

50:02.440 --> 50:06.760
many dividends, and all things considered, in spite of the trailblazing narrative, everybody

50:06.760 --> 50:10.680
else seemed to think that this trail had been run. Given that episodes on made talk shows were

50:10.680 --> 50:15.080
temporarily placed on hold at the start of 2020, people thought it would be a fitting time to put

50:15.080 --> 50:32.520
this experiment to bed. On YouTube in particular, the narrative had mostly been established that

50:32.520 --> 50:36.760
this was likely the end of Lily Singh as we know it. I think the idea that the show would be

50:36.760 --> 50:40.680
cancelled was good clickbait, and played into the predominant outlook on the matter.

50:40.680 --> 50:44.760
Throughout the start of 2020, there didn't appear to be much news on the fate of Lily Singh's late

50:44.760 --> 50:49.160
night show, and this led to more speculation, but there was probably one more piece of important

50:49.160 --> 50:53.880
information that led to hesitancy to decide on its fate. I know it's not the most fun topic to

50:53.880 --> 50:58.200
talk about, and I can't blame anyone for switching their ears off now, but it probably is one of the

50:58.200 --> 51:03.560
most relevant to today's video. As we know, in 2020, the world was deep in the clutches of the

51:03.560 --> 51:08.040
coronavirus, and amidst concern relating to the contagion of the disease, governments in many

51:08.040 --> 51:12.280
countries and American states urged people to socially distance and work from home where

51:12.280 --> 51:16.840
possible. This included the state of California and Los Angeles County, which enforced austere

51:16.840 --> 51:21.240
restrictions on social contact between parties who didn't share the same household. This was bad news

51:21.240 --> 51:25.640
for Hollywood, whose output typically required the input of a large workforce, and made filming

51:25.640 --> 51:30.120
anything safely practically impossible. This was particularly relevant for talk shows, which not

51:30.120 --> 51:34.920
just relied on studio crew, but guest appearances and an audience to provide that necessary

51:34.920 --> 51:38.920
atmosphere. There were serious questions looming as to how they would be able to generate this

51:38.920 --> 51:43.000
environment without many of the seemingly essential elements that these shows demanded.

51:43.000 --> 51:46.920
However, with everyone at home and spending more time than ever in front of their screens,

51:46.920 --> 51:49.080
networks weren't ready to be caught slacking.

51:49.080 --> 52:02.200
Hi guys, this is Jimmy Fallon, and this is the Tonight Show Home Edition, I guess you can call it.

52:02.200 --> 52:07.800
We really don't know what this is, but I wanted to put something out there for you guys so that we

52:07.800 --> 52:16.040
can just have some levity in these bizarre times. It didn't take long for a new format to be

52:16.040 --> 52:19.560
launched, and for many talk show hosts, this encompassed the presenter hosting from their

52:19.560 --> 52:24.040
humble abode. They'd be accompanied by a couple crew members fully masked up, a guest on their

52:24.040 --> 52:28.280
television set, and an audience of people attending remotely. There were many people who

52:28.280 --> 52:32.680
definitely enjoyed this more laid back ambiance, but it's hard to say that some of these hosts felt

52:32.680 --> 52:38.200
completely at home, no pun intended, with the new setting. If only there was someone who could be.

52:38.200 --> 52:42.920
COVID also means that we can't have an audience for your tapings. Are you going to be able to

52:42.920 --> 52:46.440
handle working without the energy of a live audience? Yeah, that sounds a lot like YouTube,

52:46.440 --> 52:48.040
and I don't know if I have enough experience.

52:48.680 --> 52:52.760
Due to its recording schedule, the first season of A Little Late ran into the implementation of

52:52.760 --> 52:57.240
social distancing. However, when the time came around to consider renewal, much to some people's

52:57.240 --> 53:02.520
surprise, NBC decided to do just that. On May 13th, it was announced that A Little Late with

53:02.520 --> 53:06.760
Lilly Singh would be returning for a second season at the start of 2021. There were many

53:06.760 --> 53:11.240
reasons cited for this, although viewership wasn't quite as high as it could be. The show

53:11.240 --> 53:15.560
led all first year shows in the number of social media engagements, with NBC lauding her as an

53:15.560 --> 53:19.800
incredible talent who brought an expanding global audience to the network. I think it's a valid

53:19.800 --> 53:23.800
point, although a cursory view may tell you that ratings weren't the best. If you're bringing

53:23.800 --> 53:27.880
700,000 new viewers to a network, then you're likely doing more than a person who may pull

53:27.880 --> 53:32.040
1 million already existing viewers. In this scenario, the social media response aided the

53:32.040 --> 53:35.880
show. Even if most potential viewers thought it was bad, the debate that it created online

53:35.960 --> 53:39.880
reeled in many individuals who hadn't ever engaged in late night TV as a genre,

53:39.880 --> 53:44.280
at least not to the degree that this discourse did. However, the evolving dominion that talk

53:44.280 --> 53:48.600
shows could exist in was also probably the main cause for consideration. Household names were

53:48.600 --> 53:52.760
being forced to downscale production to maintain it, and whereas some may not have been accustomed

53:52.760 --> 53:56.280
to that style, especially those who were used to a lot of support, it was that style that

53:56.280 --> 54:00.280
established the careers of many online creators on a certain video showing platform.

54:00.280 --> 54:18.120
This was Lilly Singh's moment, and she enthusiastically announced the second

54:18.120 --> 54:21.960
season of her show on its official YouTube channel, inspiring excited responses from

54:21.960 --> 54:26.280
many of her fans. Would she be up to the challenge, and would any criticism directed

54:26.280 --> 54:30.840
towards her previously be heeded? This would all mean very little unless she gave people

54:30.840 --> 54:35.400
reason to watch her. She may finally have a home advantage, but she still had many other

54:35.400 --> 55:02.040
contemporaries to compete with and wrestle viewership from. Well, in a video posted on

55:02.040 --> 55:05.800
her personal blog channel the same day that season two was announced, she promised to do

55:05.800 --> 55:10.200
just that, stating that although she was pleased with her work in season one, she knew there was

55:10.200 --> 55:16.360
still a lot to be done. The truth is it was my season one of doing something brand new,

55:16.360 --> 55:21.400
and season one Lilly reminded me a lot like first YouTube video Lilly, you know, everything takes

55:21.400 --> 55:27.000
time, it takes practice, and the reason I communicate this is really just to say I'm proud

55:27.000 --> 55:31.320
of season one, but I know there's a lot to improve on, and so when you give me feedback like why

55:31.320 --> 55:35.160
doesn't she have this guest on her show? Why isn't she doing this? It's not for lack of trying,

55:35.160 --> 55:45.160
it's just I'm trying to figure it out. But words can only say so much. Would it be done?

55:55.480 --> 55:59.960
There are so many things I have learned, and I feel like going into season two what I'm really

55:59.960 --> 56:04.680
excited about is taking all that knowledge, all the times I've made mistakes and stumbled and

56:04.680 --> 56:09.560
was confused, now I know all that stuff, I still have a lot to learn, but I know some stuff now,

56:09.560 --> 56:15.000
and I can step into season two just that much better. Much of 2020 was pretty quiet on the

56:15.000 --> 56:18.920
announcements front of the TV show at the heart of this humble video, but in December it was

56:18.920 --> 56:22.920
reported that the writing crew behind Little Later had been completely overhauled, with Lilly

56:22.920 --> 56:27.080
revealing in a statement that she intended to bring more creativity to the table, it seemed

56:27.080 --> 56:32.360
that she would have a bit more freedom to pursue her own visions, and on January 11th 2021 the

56:32.360 --> 56:37.080
second season of A Little Late with Lilly Singh made its debut, and we would finally answer the

56:37.080 --> 56:48.040
question, what has changed? Well, to be honest, a lot.

56:57.400 --> 57:01.560
In her video reflecting on season one, Lilly had acknowledged people's desire for more sketch

57:01.560 --> 57:05.720
sequences, and the first upload from the new season onto the program's YouTube channel was just

57:05.720 --> 57:09.960
that, a sketch in which Lilly plays a variety of characters, including the classic YouTube

57:09.960 --> 57:14.840
caricatures of her family and Kamala Harris, whose similarities with Lilly are used as a foundation

57:14.840 --> 57:18.840
of a joke that they are actually related. She also uploaded a version of this onto her personal

57:18.840 --> 57:23.720
YouTube channel, with it amassing 1.7 million views as of today. This is the sort of sketch

57:23.720 --> 57:27.640
where Lilly's nature play multiple characters worked very effectively in a COVID world that

57:27.640 --> 57:31.720
aimed to minimise social contact. Although in the first series Lilly had committed to mostly

57:31.720 --> 57:35.960
refraining from overtly political topics, the second season brought Lilly her rant room,

57:35.960 --> 57:39.720
which would allow her to speak more candidly on subjects that mattered to her. These did include

57:39.720 --> 57:43.640
some political subjects, which isn't surprising given that this was around the time of the

57:43.640 --> 57:48.120
inauguration of then president-elect Joe Biden, and the resistance that such circumstances

57:48.120 --> 57:52.360
precipitated, this being one of the first topics that Lilly addresses in her rant room.

57:53.800 --> 57:58.440
We need all the positivity we can get, especially with the recent news of everything that has gone

57:58.440 --> 58:03.320
down at the Capitol, and I'm gonna be honest, I have lost all patience for anyone that is still

58:03.320 --> 58:07.160
questioning privilege. Additionally, interviews seem far more free-flowing. One of the most

58:07.160 --> 58:11.080
common criticisms, even from established media critics, was that Lilly's nature to try and

58:11.080 --> 58:15.320
interject her own jokes and punchlines seems to detract from the presence of the guest. In the

58:15.320 --> 58:19.400
second season, Lilly still manages to interweave herself into certain questions, but at the same

58:19.400 --> 58:23.080
time so that it doesn't take away from her company. It'd also be fair to say that Lilly's

58:23.080 --> 58:26.840
second season probably did more work in altering the landscape of talk shows than her first one.

58:26.840 --> 58:31.400
Over 20% of her guests on season 2 were making their late night debut, a very significant

58:31.400 --> 58:36.120
percentage considering how many shows often tend to stick with certain safe choices for those spots.

58:36.120 --> 58:39.720
Lilly often went with guests that she felt she'd be comfortable around, and it seemed to work

58:39.720 --> 58:40.840
rather well for her.

58:40.840 --> 58:47.960
You have such a level of confidence that I really love, also low-key want, and I feel like your

58:47.960 --> 58:54.600
season 2, I'm trying to be the iciest version of myself. How can I be my iciest self for season 2?

58:54.600 --> 58:55.560
Give me some pro tips.

58:55.560 --> 58:59.880
So like, I see it's like a mentality, it's your hustle, so you know, maybe setting some

58:59.880 --> 59:04.600
financial goals. I mean, I already know you a boss, you have your own show, so I can tell you

59:04.600 --> 59:07.080
know, you already got your life figured out.

59:07.080 --> 59:09.880
Interviews shortly after the first episode of the new season aired,

59:09.880 --> 59:13.160
Lilly stated that she wanted to bring a degree of imperfection to the show,

59:13.160 --> 59:17.000
and this is also pretty evident. A lot of content that would be typically cut out of

59:17.080 --> 59:21.240
a larger scale production was left in, shots of the crew fully masked up, and the backstage

59:21.240 --> 59:24.920
equipment may seem unprofessional in certain environments, but here it seemed to fit the

59:24.920 --> 59:29.480
casual mise-en-scene rather effectively. Funnily enough, in spite of being restricted to a single

59:29.480 --> 59:33.080
residence, Lilly seemed to find much more use for the set than she had in the first season,

59:33.080 --> 59:35.560
utilising it for a variety of purposes and skits.

59:35.560 --> 59:40.040
Lilly- I just want you to confirm that there is good spirits in here, and if there's bad spirits...

59:40.040 --> 59:41.400
Lilly- Let's go throughout the whole house.

59:41.400 --> 59:44.280
Lilly- I mostly just don't want them in hair and makeup, it's fine if they're in like the edit bay

59:44.280 --> 59:47.160
and stuff like that, I'm just not trying to have them anywhere I am.

59:47.160 --> 59:50.600
Now just because something is different doesn't mean that it's necessarily better,

59:50.600 --> 59:54.520
and for some online it certainly wasn't. Many people who had criticised Lilly's first season

59:54.520 --> 59:59.080
continued into the second, pointing out what they felt were shortcomings in this sort of content.

59:59.080 --> 01:00:02.840
Yes, this is the way we're used to seeing Lilly Singh and other YouTubers portrayed,

01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:07.720
talking directly in front of a camera or sketches where they play more than one person in the same

01:00:07.720 --> 01:00:12.840
scene, but it very much feels like an industry plant Lilly Singh instead of actual Lilly Singh,

01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:17.320
simply because like any other TV show there are many people working on it,

01:00:17.320 --> 01:00:22.680
and the more of Lilly's late show I watch, the less control I feel like she actually has over it.

01:00:22.680 --> 01:00:26.280
And it's not like this criticism was without merit, certain aspects of Lilly's show

01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:30.680
probably could be perceived as unnecessarily convoluted and lacking focus, the jokes were

01:00:30.680 --> 01:00:35.000
hit and miss, and there were some pretty bad misses. However, the best metric to tell if

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:39.560
this sort of content was affected with its target audience was just to read the comments as always,

01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:43.560
and in this season's case, the response was much more positive, and it's clear that these

01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:47.720
weren't just fans who would say that regardless, there were many viewers who noted its improvement

01:00:47.720 --> 01:00:51.800
on the previous season. Now this doesn't mean that negative comments didn't exist elsewhere,

01:00:51.800 --> 01:00:55.560
or anywhere, but for the most part they provide the impression that these people would never

01:00:55.560 --> 01:01:00.040
really enjoy Lilly Singh anyway, or late night TV as a whole. It's important to remember that

01:01:00.040 --> 01:01:04.600
late night shows can be a bit preachy and heavy handed with their humour and messaging,

01:01:04.600 --> 01:01:09.160
trying to keep an audience entertained and pushing the envelope while not being crass

01:01:09.160 --> 01:01:13.800
is a somewhat delicate art and you will fall short at points. Lilly Singh having some of that

01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:18.120
wasn't a deal breaker for most people, and let's face it, she didn't necessarily build her career

01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:22.360
on subtlety. As a TV show working within the perimeter of a long established industry,

01:01:22.360 --> 01:01:26.680
there would always be some contrivances, but I think this was as close as many were going to get

01:01:26.680 --> 01:01:31.400
to Lilly Singh actually being herself in the late night format, and for regular viewers of her,

01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:35.160
that was a resounding victory. This appeared to be a resounding victory for Lilly as well,

01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:38.760
who spoke about how she felt so much more comfortable in season 2, stating that she had

01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:42.760
become tired of monitoring herself and her thoughts, and just chose to speak about whatever

01:01:42.760 --> 01:01:46.200
was on her mind, prioritising that authenticity.

01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:50.600
Like admittedly in season 1 I thought there were moments where I wasn't completely being myself,

01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:55.160
maybe I was nervous or I felt a lot of pressure, and so with season 2 I'm really prioritising

01:01:55.720 --> 01:01:59.320
throwing all facades out the window, I want to be completely authentic, you know me and my

01:01:59.320 --> 01:02:04.040
producers always have like little mini headbutt sessions because I'll be interviewing a guest

01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:07.560
and they'll script something that's like, you know I love doing this movie, and I'll be like

01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:12.200
I've never seen that movie, and I insist on being authentic about it because I don't want to lie,

01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:16.680
I'd rather make the time to watch all of the things before I interview someone, and if I don't

01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:21.080
have the time I'd rather be honest and say like, listen, people online are going crazy about you,

01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:26.360
as opposed to like, I loved you in this movie and I'm such a big fan because I just feel like

01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:30.760
it doesn't feel like it's real. It seems like the shackles that COVID had placed on society in

01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:35.240
general had actually unshackled Lilly from a lot of the customs that late night TV was expected

01:02:35.320 --> 01:02:39.720
to conform to, and for the first time Lilly Singh had room to embrace the environment that had

01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:44.760
brought her so much prosperity on YouTube. Could this be the future of television talk shows?

01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:47.960
Could Lilly Singh be the future of late night TV?

01:02:55.480 --> 01:02:59.480
Sometimes there's very little you can do. Next time I hear anyone hating on Gen Z,

01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:01.240
I'm just gonna tell them bye bye bye.

01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:02.600
What?

01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:06.440
Throughout the start of 2021, Lilly Singh's show appeared to be performing well with those who

01:03:06.440 --> 01:03:10.280
engaged with it, however unfortunately it's also about the number of people who engaged with the

01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:14.040
content in the first place, and in a time when numbers should have been boosted from people

01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:19.480
staying at home and watching TV, Lilly Singh's ratings left a lot to be desired. In the extent

01:03:19.480 --> 01:03:23.480
of her time on air, her viewership decreased approximately a quarter from her predecessor

01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:27.800
Carson Daly, with this continuing to trend downwards in the second season. This was also

01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:32.680
the case with YouTube, where views on videos would regularly fall below 100,000. Additionally,

01:03:32.680 --> 01:03:37.320
as much as the home setting was pretty unique and well suited to Lilly's style, many shows were

01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:40.760
beginning to venture back into the studio, and although it wouldn't have been impossible to

01:03:40.760 --> 01:03:44.360
continue the home setting which appeared to be popular with some viewers, it would've been a

01:03:44.360 --> 01:03:49.000
gamble as they didn't exactly embody the late night aesthetic that many had become used to.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:53.160
Although it was true that Lilly brought a fair few new viewers to the network, there were still

01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:58.120
a lot of financial factors that NBC needed to consider, and in lieu of this, just under a month

01:03:58.120 --> 01:04:02.360
before the second season even concluded, it was announced that a little late with Lilly Singh

01:04:02.360 --> 01:04:07.640
would not be returning for a third season, to the disappointment of fans and the joy of detractors.

01:04:07.640 --> 01:04:11.400
With that said, it was also announced that this was not the end of Lilly Singh's career at NBC,

01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:15.480
and that she would be signing a first look contract with Universal for future unscripted

01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:19.640
projects, which shows the network definitely saw the potential in much of her second season.

01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:23.400
It was also announced that she would be involved in the development of a comedy series with

01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:29.160
Black-ish creator Kenya Barris, not a bad result. Overall, this news was framed by many outlets as

01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:33.640
a recalibration rather than a cancellation. Lilly herself released a statement to social

01:04:33.640 --> 01:04:37.080
media on the day of the announcement, stating that although they would be saying goodbye to

01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:41.000
A Little Late with Lilly Singh, this would allow her to focus more on her production company and

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:44.600
her own projects. Additionally, she was very excited to share the aforementioned upcoming

01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:49.080
enterprises that she would be working on, and to be honest, Lilly has every reason to feel optimistic

01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:52.680
moving forward. As she had mentioned in an earlier video of hers, regardless of the reception

01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:57.080
to her show, it had raised her profile notably, and even during its airing, the number of roles

01:04:57.080 --> 01:05:01.480
she secured increased significantly. This included acquiring further voice acting paths for two

01:05:01.480 --> 01:05:05.880
animated feature films, an array of TV positions that would eventually lead to her being offered

01:05:05.880 --> 01:05:10.600
a spot on the judging panel for Canada's Got Talent, and a host role for this year's Academy

01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:11.720
Awards pre-show.

01:05:36.200 --> 01:05:40.280
By all intents and purposes, endless doors have been opened due to her position in hosting a

01:05:40.280 --> 01:05:44.040
late night talk show, regardless of whether it was good or bad, and the future was looking

01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:48.280
quite exciting for her. Lilly expressed optimism in moving forward with these undertakings,

01:05:48.280 --> 01:05:52.600
and bringing diversity to the screen in an even bigger way, and she's certainly not wrong. There

01:05:52.600 --> 01:05:56.360
was little doubt that this was a great leap forward in her career, and work that would be

01:05:56.360 --> 01:06:00.840
turned down by very few people. As much fun as she probably had with the second season of her show,

01:06:00.840 --> 01:06:05.480
it was also a very demanding and time-consuming schedule, and this change in pace would probably

01:06:05.480 --> 01:06:10.200
give her a bit more breathing room to do what she wanted to, and on her own terms as well. With this

01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:13.640
in mind, on the 23rd of July, Lilly returned to her YouTube channel.

01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:27.880
Here she spoke about a variety of projects, but also stated that she was excited to be back on

01:06:27.880 --> 01:06:32.840
YouTube, and making content that she had control over, promising to be more untamed than ever.

01:06:40.200 --> 01:06:59.560
It seems that her enjoyment of sketches have been reignited once more, and over the coming weeks

01:06:59.560 --> 01:07:03.480
and months she posted many of these sketches onto her channel. These videos typically involved a

01:07:03.480 --> 01:07:07.480
large cast and higher production values than her older content, but still attempted to convey that

01:07:07.480 --> 01:07:28.120
same relatable sketch humour that propelled her to stardom. A couple of these videos picked

01:07:28.120 --> 01:07:32.040
up on the algorithm, but most performed pretty modestly for a channel of Lilly's size,

01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:36.600
scoring a similar count to her network ratings. The truth was that comedy on YouTube had headed

01:07:36.600 --> 01:07:40.360
in a different direction in the last few years, either towards more commentary-driven content,

01:07:40.360 --> 01:07:45.320
or even shorter, more absurdist sketches like the ones you see on TikTok. The audience was evolving,

01:07:45.320 --> 01:07:50.200
and many of Lilly's prospective viewers did lie in places other than YouTube. If one thing was clear,

01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:54.520
it was that NBC quite liked Lilly Singh, and although they weren't willing to continue the

01:07:54.520 --> 01:07:59.400
talk show, they wanted to retain her abilities for future content, and both parties seemed happy with

01:07:59.400 --> 01:08:03.480
that outcome. It's not hard to see why many thought a late night show catered towards a more

01:08:03.480 --> 01:08:07.720
millennial audience should have legs. Unfortunately, it just didn't, and although

01:08:07.720 --> 01:08:11.400
there'll always be a recurring audience, the numbers have been dwindling for the past few

01:08:11.400 --> 01:08:16.360
years, and Lilly's slot was already not considered prime time. Since Lilly's departure, other hosts

01:08:16.360 --> 01:08:20.920
who had broadcast at similar time slots had also left their programs, including Trevor Noah and

01:08:20.920 --> 01:08:25.400
James Corden. NBC themselves had stated they would not be replenishing the time slot, and subsequently

01:08:25.400 --> 01:08:29.800
handed it back to affiliates in the following months, making Lilly the last host of a talk show

01:08:29.800 --> 01:08:35.000
in that time slot held since 1988. From NBC's perspective, it was clear that it wasn't just

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:39.320
a Lilly problem, but a systemic one that wouldn't be so easy to resolve. Some presented the

01:08:39.320 --> 01:08:43.480
cancellation of Lilly Singh's talk show as a mercy killing, and although a network is seldom

01:08:43.480 --> 01:08:47.800
going to admit when something isn't working, the decision to discontinue programs at that specific

01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:51.960
time slot after discontinuing Lilly's show probably implies they were struggling with that

01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:57.320
period as it was, and Lilly Singh's show was much more a Hail Mary to save a struggling medium which

01:08:57.320 --> 01:09:02.760
less and less people were tuning into, rather than the destroyer of NBC bank balances. It seems

01:09:02.760 --> 01:09:07.240
evident that really, NBC were trying to ask a greater question. Lilly Singh was a creator with

01:09:07.240 --> 01:09:12.040
15 million subscribers on YouTube, could you translate that sort of digital success into a

01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:17.240
media-based viewership for a network TV show? The short answer in that case was, no.

01:09:17.240 --> 01:09:22.440
Lilly Singh-"It's been an honor to be on your screens for two seasons. Thank you so much for all of your love

01:09:22.440 --> 01:09:27.720
and support and for betting on this crazy girl. I can't wait to see what we do together next.

01:09:27.720 --> 01:09:31.160
Until then, it's been fun." What's the long answer though?

01:09:39.720 --> 01:09:43.320
I think it's very easy to write off a little late with Lilly Singh as something that was doomed to

01:09:43.320 --> 01:09:47.000
fail from the start, and in a way I think there are a lot of valid arguments that could be made

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:51.960
to support that. We've already heard some of them. However, is there an alternative reality

01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:56.360
where a little late with Lilly Singh was actually an undisputed commercial and critical triumph?

01:09:56.360 --> 01:10:00.040
I'd say it was more possible than many might assume. First, we need to talk about the

01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:04.200
circumstances that surrounded the creation of a little late with Lilly Singh. Sure, it wasn't a

01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:08.360
great time for talk shows, many believed this was in part due to the rise of streaming, and they may

01:10:08.360 --> 01:10:12.280
have had a point, but many clips from talk shows still performed well on YouTube, and even if they

01:10:12.280 --> 01:10:16.520
were losing their share of the market in one place, they still held down a reasonable audience in

01:10:16.520 --> 01:10:20.760
another. Lilly Singh's career was from YouTube, born and raised, and this should have been a

01:10:20.760 --> 01:10:25.800
stomping ground. Although times were changing, they hadn't changed that quickly. When reading

01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:29.720
comments about her late night show being launched, I noticed a trend of a lot of people saying they

01:10:29.720 --> 01:10:34.040
were happy for her, even though they didn't really watch her content anymore. I think that should

01:10:34.040 --> 01:10:38.600
have been considered when creating the show. Lilly was someone who didn't quite have the draw she

01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:43.400
once had on YouTube, and late night talk shows faced the same problem on TV, but in a way that's

01:10:43.400 --> 01:10:49.320
why it should have worked. But sure, people thought they had outgrown Lilly, and they definitely had

01:10:49.320 --> 01:10:54.440
on YouTube, but a more mature spin on her content is exactly what the late night world should have

01:10:54.440 --> 01:10:59.000
brought her, it should have been an open goal for that much at least. There are obviously a

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:03.160
wide spectrum of opinions on Lilly's technique, and I have to say it's not really my cup of tea

01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:07.160
personally, but when you've seen enough late night clips, you tend to gather a mental image for what

01:11:07.160 --> 01:11:12.440
is generally considered acceptable content for the genre, and Lilly's content wasn't exactly outside

01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:16.280
of that realm. If the second season showed us anything, it's that although there may be some

01:11:16.280 --> 01:11:20.440
who would never really enjoy Lilly's style, there definitely was a way to make her YouTube sketch

01:11:20.440 --> 01:11:25.000
content compatible with some of the usual traffics of mainstream television. But, I hear you say,

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:29.240
season two was completely different to the first season, and late night television as a whole.

01:11:29.240 --> 01:11:33.800
Lilly was in an environment much closer to her original YouTube content, and you my friend are

01:11:33.800 --> 01:11:37.800
not wrong, I'll grant you that much. But season two didn't just work the way it did because it

01:11:37.800 --> 01:11:41.800
was in a house, it may have littered some pressure off Lilly's shoulders, but she still had to carry

01:11:41.800 --> 01:11:46.120
the show in a way that she hadn't done before, and for many people she did just that. But how

01:11:46.120 --> 01:12:03.080
would it have translated into a studio environment? Well, I think she should have just taken more of a

01:12:03.080 --> 01:12:07.960
homegrown vibe to make it work. Lilly stated that she often felt confined in her sets and suits,

01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:11.960
and although there are often foundations of many late night talk shows, I don't think a lot of

01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:16.120
people would have cared if she didn't care for them. It was the same reason a lot of people found

01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:20.360
the monologue somewhat laboured, it wasn't what was comfortable for her, and although sometimes

01:12:20.360 --> 01:12:24.120
it's good to learn new skills and abilities, trying to cram it in multiple recordings in

01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:28.280
the space of a few months wasn't going to aid her development on that front, and many people

01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:33.000
noted how she did genuinely struggle with those aspects of the show. Drop the suits, drop the

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:36.840
monologues, Lilly worked best when she was surrounded by people who she could bounce her

01:12:36.840 --> 01:12:40.920
energy off. In promoting her show, Lilly made a fair few appearances on other people's shows,

01:12:40.920 --> 01:12:44.440
and in many comment sections you'd see audience members surprised that actually,

01:12:44.440 --> 01:12:47.400
she could have a pretty natural and free-flowing conversation.

01:12:47.400 --> 01:13:07.960
Lilly was a talented speaker in many regards, she often seemed the most comfortable when she

01:13:07.960 --> 01:13:11.720
was being impromptu, and if that talent was harboured correctly, there was no reason for

01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:15.800
it not to work in a talk show environment, it really should have been a slam dunk as well.

01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:19.800
The talk shows are still more than that, and as many observed this was a stale genre

01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:23.800
that Lilly should have kicked the door in, but a lot of people felt she ultimately didn't manage

01:13:23.800 --> 01:13:28.840
to. What could she have done differently to ensure that change? Lilly had made the bold decision to

01:13:28.840 --> 01:13:33.160
not necessarily make current affairs the focal point of her content, and to completely avoid

01:13:33.160 --> 01:13:37.240
politics as a topic. This was framed as an active production choice, but also would have been

01:13:37.240 --> 01:13:41.000
imperative due to the recording schedule as there was no way to predict what subject would be

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:45.480
trending months after recording. It's a challenging objective to set oneself, and many would argue

01:13:45.480 --> 01:13:50.040
that it was simply impossible to do, because current affairs is how talk shows make themselves

01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:53.960
relevant to their audience. Nevertheless, the movement towards YouTube for a lot of these

01:13:53.960 --> 01:13:58.360
programs did provide the potential for more timeless discourse, as content could be accessed

01:13:58.360 --> 01:14:02.680
in the months, years and decades after they aired. With that acknowledged, Lilly still needed to

01:14:02.680 --> 01:14:06.920
ensure that the subject she lined up could sufficiently propel an episode of her show.

01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:31.560
The topic she chose often related to her identity and experiences, and on the surface they weren't

01:14:31.560 --> 01:14:36.120
bad subjects to discuss or to channel into one's content, but the traditional monologue style of

01:14:36.120 --> 01:14:40.520
late night TV often made the delivery of these subjects somewhat forced and stiff. I think the

01:14:40.520 --> 01:14:44.920
show not tell aspect would have aided her here, people felt most empowered when she was able to

01:14:44.920 --> 01:14:49.480
express her identity without explicitly stating it, and it clearly held meaning to a lot of people

01:14:49.480 --> 01:14:54.120
that shouldn't have been overlooked. There was real potential here to change late night TV for

01:14:54.120 --> 01:14:59.000
the better. So yes, for what it's worth, I do think as a cosy late night show that perhaps didn't ask

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:02.840
too much of the viewer, and just featured Lilly shooting the shit with a variety of celebrities

01:15:02.840 --> 01:15:06.920
and channeling her energy and background in a unique way could have worked pretty effectively,

01:15:06.920 --> 01:15:11.000
even in a studio environment, and it still could have become that in time if a third season had

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:15.400
been greenlighted. The first season was quite the deep end to be thrown into, even as an established

01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:19.960
figure amongst Hollywood society. Lilly had never anchored a major talk show, let alone held a

01:15:19.960 --> 01:15:24.440
prominent role in one, she'd done a few interviews and proven herself as a decent conversationalist,

01:15:24.440 --> 01:15:28.520
but when you introduce so many different features and accrue to a person who is often coasting off

01:15:28.520 --> 01:15:32.680
their own spontaneous nature, you're seriously complicating the formula. But it's not that I

01:15:32.680 --> 01:15:36.360
don't think it couldn't have worked in the right environment, it's just that in an attempt to

01:15:36.440 --> 01:15:41.000
provide Lilly Singh with proverbial stabilisers, the network overlooks what made her such an

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:44.920
effective talker and host in the first place. Those are the teething issues of the first season

01:15:44.920 --> 01:15:51.080
that could have been alleviated over time, and in a way they were, yet it wasn't enough. Why?

01:15:51.640 --> 01:15:53.400
Well, first impressions are everything.

01:16:01.720 --> 01:16:05.880
I'm going to say something fairly uncontroversial right now, the first episode of A Little Late

01:16:05.880 --> 01:16:07.880
with Lilly Singh was not very good.

01:16:15.320 --> 01:16:19.400
I appreciate that the critics saw something a lot of audiences did, but for an episode that

01:16:19.400 --> 01:16:23.640
was meant to take late night into a new era, it fundamentally fell short of what it was trying

01:16:23.640 --> 01:16:27.640
to do. It's funny because the whole episode is about the fact that she's breaking new ground,

01:16:27.640 --> 01:16:31.960
and yet bar a couple moments it all feels surprisingly interchangeable with the majority

01:16:31.960 --> 01:16:36.520
of her peers and competitors. Sometimes it's not just about saying, it's about being,

01:16:36.520 --> 01:16:40.920
and there is little debate that Lilly Singh is a person of Indian Punjabi descent raised in Canada,

01:16:40.920 --> 01:16:44.520
but if someone put a gun to your head and told you to prove it, you wouldn't just say you are,

01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:49.160
or perform a rap about it, you'd show your culture and background. For the number of jokes directed

01:16:49.160 --> 01:16:53.320
at white people's expense, it still almost felt catered to white people who were comfortable

01:16:53.320 --> 01:16:57.320
laughing at their failure to understand other cultures, but not comfortable in trying to

01:16:57.320 --> 01:17:01.400
actually understand them. For a show that should have been directed towards a slightly younger

01:17:01.400 --> 01:17:05.320
audience who are far more engaged in that sort of discourse, particularly with the multicultural

01:17:05.320 --> 01:17:10.680
aspect of online spaces, it felt like they didn't have a fundamental comprehension or respect for a

01:17:10.680 --> 01:17:21.960
fair few of their target viewers. And yet, whereas the first episode could have flown under the

01:17:21.960 --> 01:17:25.880
radar and never been spoken about again, many descended on the show to critique,

01:17:25.880 --> 01:17:30.440
criticise, and deride Lilly Singh for said failings. And as noted, the YouTube algorithm

01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:34.440
favoured these clips as they received the most attention, regardless of whether it was positive

01:17:34.440 --> 01:17:38.840
or negative. Modern YouTube comedians and commentators similarly chimed into the matter

01:17:38.840 --> 01:17:42.520
that was one of their own trying to fly the coop, yet struggling to spread their wings.

01:17:42.520 --> 01:17:48.280
But then the second episode aired, and the third, and the fourth, and the fifth, and the rest, yet,

01:17:48.280 --> 01:17:53.080
in the next couple months people still almost seemed to solely focus on the first few episodes,

01:17:53.080 --> 01:17:58.280
or just the first episode exclusively. Now Lilly didn't exactly help by making indirect responses

01:17:58.360 --> 01:18:01.160
to these videos which showed that she hadn't really watched any of them,

01:18:01.160 --> 01:18:04.920
which then promoted more responses to people annoyed at her response, but what if I was to

01:18:04.920 --> 01:18:08.120
sit here and tell you that it wasn't just the second season that was fine,

01:18:08.120 --> 01:18:10.920
but a large majority of the remainder of the first season was fine as well.

01:18:18.920 --> 01:18:22.440
Maybe not. There are still a fair few issues which we've already spoken about,

01:18:22.440 --> 01:18:26.040
and I think they were difficult to fully address in the space of a season that was recorded with

01:18:26.040 --> 01:18:30.680
the intensity of a little late. To be frank, it still gets pretty dire at points.

01:18:30.680 --> 01:18:34.040
Nonetheless, a large majority of the season wasn't video response worthy,

01:18:34.040 --> 01:18:37.800
and that's why, simply put, there were very few videos covering those episodes,

01:18:37.800 --> 01:18:41.720
and it is a fair bit of a shame that this was the case, and that many had passed judgement

01:18:41.720 --> 01:18:46.920
for October had even come around. It was episode one of season one, you go back and watch early

01:18:46.920 --> 01:18:50.440
episodes of some of the most prestigious talk shows, and they aren't the best.

01:18:50.440 --> 01:18:54.760
Hell, some of the greatest TV shows of all time needed a couple seasons to fully find their feet,

01:18:54.760 --> 01:18:58.600
it's easy for people to give books, films, and the rest a negative review because you can

01:18:58.600 --> 01:19:03.720
experience it all at once. The episodic nature of a TV series though made that first episode

01:19:03.720 --> 01:19:08.200
even more important. A little late with Lilly Singh will be remembered by many for as little

01:19:08.200 --> 01:19:12.360
as a line. Hell, some people were still reacting to those first season monologues

01:19:12.360 --> 01:19:15.720
over half a year after these episodes were published onto YouTube.

01:19:25.320 --> 01:19:29.160
Yeah, girl, I don't know about that one.

01:19:29.160 --> 01:19:32.120
Let me make it clear, Lilly stoked the fire by responding the way she did,

01:19:32.120 --> 01:19:35.560
because it kept all the focus on these questionable writing decisions. Dismissing

01:19:35.560 --> 01:19:39.160
what was otherwise legitimate criticism, she probably felt like she was being unfairly

01:19:39.160 --> 01:19:43.400
scrutinised for cherry picked segments of a show that had already aired hours of content

01:19:43.400 --> 01:19:47.480
at that point. It's natural to feel defensive, particularly given the amount of effort she

01:19:47.480 --> 01:19:51.320
felt she had invested into the show, but the best response would have just been to speak

01:19:51.400 --> 01:19:55.800
to audiences and ask them to give it another chance if she really thought it was worth it.

01:19:55.800 --> 01:20:00.280
As noted, she alienated her own viewers through her style, and they weren't audiences that could

01:20:00.280 --> 01:20:04.520
never be won over, it just felt like she didn't care enough to try and do so, or she thought it

01:20:04.520 --> 01:20:09.080
was an effective marketing tool to win new people over, and to an extent it was I guess,

01:20:09.080 --> 01:20:13.480
but only as a temporary measure, and not the healthiest measure all things considered.

01:20:14.040 --> 01:20:18.520
As we know, at the end of the first season, NBC bragged about how A Little Late with Lilly Singh

01:20:18.520 --> 01:20:23.560
received the most social engagements of any debut TV show, and that was a feat of some sorts,

01:20:23.560 --> 01:20:28.200
but that was only due to the discourse surrounding her qualities as a late night host in the programme

01:20:28.200 --> 01:20:33.880
itself. Problem was, as season 2 improved on season 1, there was less desire for that debate. Lilly

01:20:33.880 --> 01:20:37.800
probably could have accrued more short term views by inviting all her internet critics round and

01:20:37.800 --> 01:20:41.400
debating them at her house, but instead she actually clearly took some of the feedback

01:20:41.400 --> 01:20:45.640
on board and transformed her set and style, and yet because the show was now actually

01:20:45.640 --> 01:20:50.440
good or passable at least, she couldn't rely on that debate to spur short term ratings anymore.

01:20:50.440 --> 01:20:53.880
The other issue was that there was approximately 8 months between the end of season 1 and the start

01:20:53.880 --> 01:20:58.440
of season 2, of which the show was barely mentioned to the press. This interval meant that

01:20:58.440 --> 01:21:02.040
by the time the start of the second season came around, many who had previously been engaged in

01:21:02.040 --> 01:21:05.960
the debate now were investing their attention elsewhere. When I was speaking to a few friends

01:21:05.960 --> 01:21:09.560
about this video, I mentioned that A Little Late with Lilly Singh was actually renewed for a second

01:21:09.560 --> 01:21:14.440
season, which provoked surprise from many who assumed it ended with season 1. Humans are

01:21:14.440 --> 01:21:19.160
interesting creatures, for a lot of online trends and subjects, we're only really interested in

01:21:19.160 --> 01:21:23.880
providing it with attention to a certain threshold, and then unless there is some revelation relating

01:21:23.880 --> 01:21:28.200
to the topic, we are unlikely to revisit the matter. Lilly Singh's show could have very

01:21:28.200 --> 01:21:33.160
easily had a rocky start, but built up its credo over time, and by the time that it caught the

01:21:33.160 --> 01:21:38.440
attention of those who may not be within her core fanbase, had a pretty solid reputation.

01:21:38.440 --> 01:21:42.600
Unfortunately, content spreads quickly online, and it was first impressions that defined the

01:21:42.600 --> 01:21:46.200
future of the show. You could make the argument that Lilly's show would never have improved if

01:21:46.200 --> 01:21:51.160
she hadn't received as much criticism, which is a fair point and possibly true, but the criticism

01:21:51.160 --> 01:21:55.560
became bigger than the show itself. People reached their limit for discourse regarding Lilly Singh's

01:21:55.560 --> 01:21:59.800
late show on the basis of the first few episodes and the subsequent reactions to them, but weren't

01:21:59.800 --> 01:22:04.680
ready to give it another try by the time the second season came around. First impressions

01:22:04.680 --> 01:22:10.040
really were everything. The first episode of A Little Late with Lilly Singh was not very good,

01:22:10.040 --> 01:22:14.200
but I don't think it was a complete representation of what became of the show. Unfortunately,

01:22:14.200 --> 01:22:19.080
the nature of the internet allowed judgement to be passed before she even had the chance to improve,

01:22:19.080 --> 01:22:23.240
and probably doomed the show before season 2 had even been conceptualised,

01:22:23.240 --> 01:22:26.600
and for that it was a shame. Let's wrap this up now.

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:37.480
There's an episode of Spongebob Squarepants in season 4 called Mrs Puff You're Fired,

01:22:37.480 --> 01:22:42.600
in which Mrs Puff is dismissed due to Spongebob's continuous failure of driving tests. Mrs Puff is

01:22:42.600 --> 01:22:46.760
replaced by a drill sergeant who surprisingly manages to teach Spongebob how to drive,

01:22:46.760 --> 01:22:51.240
but with one small caveat, that our Squarepanted friend has learned to do it blindfolded.

01:22:51.240 --> 01:22:55.560
When the test comes around once more, our special little Sponge is told that it's illegal to drive

01:22:55.560 --> 01:23:00.280
while blindfolded, and thus the test deteriorates very quickly, causing destruction throughout the

01:23:00.280 --> 01:23:05.080
entirety of Bikini Bottom until he's blinded once more by Patrick's slacks and suddenly becomes a

01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:09.400
competent driver again, completing the test. Unfortunately, due to the destruction that has

01:23:09.400 --> 01:23:14.920
been wrought, he is given a fail again, and Mrs Puff returns, much to her dismay. It's a fun little

01:23:14.920 --> 01:23:18.840
anecdote, but there is a lot of truth to it. Sometimes you become so accustomed to doing

01:23:18.840 --> 01:23:23.240
something a particular way that a change designed to help you may have the opposite effect.

01:23:26.040 --> 01:23:29.240
And you see, this is where the party starts.

01:23:29.240 --> 01:23:33.400
Lilly Singh procured a claim on YouTube, a platform designed to allow people to create

01:23:33.400 --> 01:23:38.040
content without the large budget and production value. In many ways, Lilly proved her talent as

01:23:38.040 --> 01:23:42.520
a creator who could use her experience to attract millions of recurring viewers. On the flipside,

01:23:42.520 --> 01:23:47.400
Late Night TV, in spite of their extravagant ambience, had also garnered a strong online

01:23:47.400 --> 01:23:52.040
following, with many hosted networks collaborating directly with YouTube to make sure their reach was

01:23:52.040 --> 01:23:56.440
optimized on a website that attracted a significantly different audience. Lilly and Late

01:23:56.440 --> 01:24:00.920
Night originated from very different parts of the creative world, but they ran parallel to each

01:24:00.920 --> 01:24:05.320
other, and bridging that gap seemed like the natural progression for both parties, and both

01:24:05.320 --> 01:24:10.200
platforms. Yet it really was the epitome of a misfire by all accounts, that will probably cause

01:24:10.200 --> 01:24:14.680
a network to think twice before working with the creator again. It prompts the question we ask at

01:24:14.680 --> 01:24:20.360
the start again, are YouTubers really suited to a world outside YouTube? Well, if the two seasons of

01:24:20.360 --> 01:24:24.760
A Little Late demonstrate anything, it's that I don't think the potential wasn't there, it's just

01:24:24.760 --> 01:24:30.120
Hollywood is struggling to understand YouTubers. NBC had said they intended to turn the time slot

01:24:30.120 --> 01:24:34.440
into more of a creative playground primed for the digital era, but I don't think anyone was

01:24:34.440 --> 01:24:39.000
committed enough to question what that really meant. From their perspective, it seemed to imply

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:43.240
an integration of sly winks to YouTube, but without the proper understanding of why they

01:24:43.240 --> 01:24:47.640
worked on the platform in the first place. Lilly Singh's Late Night show often tried to foster

01:24:47.640 --> 01:24:52.200
direct fan support, rather than necessarily marketing it as a separate entity from the mind

01:24:52.200 --> 01:24:57.000
of Lilly Singh. It's a strange decision because as noted, by that point she partly left YouTube

01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:02.280
behind. This is a problem with a lot of YouTuber based media outside of YouTube, it aids viewers

01:25:02.280 --> 01:25:07.000
who have very little familiarity with your content as a whole, yet often doesn't reach as much of

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:11.560
your fanbase who are primarily based on YouTube. Lilly Singh's YouTube content reached all four

01:25:11.560 --> 01:25:15.880
corners of the globe, something that very few Late Night shows can successfully do. Whenever

01:25:15.880 --> 01:25:19.720
YouTubers do this, it feels like studios are more interested in cashing in off their already

01:25:19.720 --> 01:25:23.400
established social media presence, rather than actually considering what made them popular in

01:25:23.400 --> 01:25:27.240
the first place. Comedy on YouTube had largely moved on from Lilly's style, and although the

01:25:27.240 --> 01:25:31.320
show had potential, it had to mature with the viewers. There was definitely an attempt to do so,

01:25:31.320 --> 01:25:34.840
but it more or less consisted of putting Lilly in a colourful suit and making her do stand-up

01:25:34.840 --> 01:25:39.880
in front of a live TV audience instead of actually playing into her well-documented strengths. She

01:25:39.880 --> 01:25:44.440
was not a stand-up comedian, nor did she wear suits really, she thrived on the spontaneous,

01:25:44.440 --> 01:25:48.680
the mess, the chaos, and watching her try to perform within the confines of that first season

01:25:48.680 --> 01:25:52.600
of Late Night sometimes felt like watching a person trying to break out of a straitjacket.

01:25:52.600 --> 01:25:56.680
Lilly had all these resources at her feet, and many probably thought it should have bolstered

01:25:56.680 --> 01:26:00.840
her comedy, but it's not how she learned, nor what she was accustomed to. Just because something

01:26:00.840 --> 01:26:05.480
should make it easier, doesn't mean it will make it easier. Sometimes people are used to the lack

01:26:05.480 --> 01:26:10.200
of direction because they feel they know themselves best. Combine that with an absolutely brutal

01:26:10.200 --> 01:26:14.680
recording schedule, and some ill-timed responses from Lilly herself, and for many the first season

01:26:14.680 --> 01:26:20.040
was dead on arrival, and not worth resuscitating. But then season two happened.

01:26:20.440 --> 01:26:23.240
Sometimes you gotta do things to fulfil your vision, and just like make it happen,

01:26:23.240 --> 01:26:27.480
that's what today is. Today is just living our dream. We're just living, we're just,

01:26:27.480 --> 01:26:32.040
Chris, we're just living our dream today. Not if you're with me. Now not the camera.

01:26:34.200 --> 01:26:38.600
And even if not everyone enjoyed it, it gave Lilly the breathing room to prove her ability

01:26:38.600 --> 01:26:42.520
in a space where many had already written her off. What would have made recording far more

01:26:42.520 --> 01:26:46.600
challenging for a variety of established talk show hosts took Lilly back to where she was most

01:26:46.600 --> 01:26:50.280
comfortable, and her second season seemed to operate far more smoothly than the first,

01:26:50.280 --> 01:26:54.440
with guests, viewers, and Lilly herself all appearing to have much more fun than the season

01:26:54.440 --> 01:26:58.760
that had come before. Alas, it had come a little too late for Lilly Singh. The damage had already

01:26:58.760 --> 01:27:02.200
been done when the first season hit the screens, and many prospective viewers had switched over

01:27:02.200 --> 01:27:05.880
the channel, with others receiving their impressions from content creators which directed

01:27:05.880 --> 01:27:10.440
online opinion. Nonetheless, if the result of the second season is just a piece of media that she

01:27:10.440 --> 01:27:14.680
and her audience can watch back and enjoy, then maybe it's done the trick. I don't think Lilly

01:27:14.680 --> 01:27:19.160
laments it too much, and overall it has brought her far more opportunities than it has cost her,

01:27:19.160 --> 01:27:23.240
and if that's the result of any piece of media then you can consider it a victory.

01:27:23.240 --> 01:27:26.200
With that said, it's obviously a shame that the show couldn't be something more,

01:27:26.200 --> 01:27:30.120
couldn't be the trailblazing shot in the arm that late night TV desperately needed.

01:27:30.120 --> 01:27:34.120
Ratings are still struggling, and it's not like there isn't a reality where I don't see shows

01:27:34.120 --> 01:27:38.280
that could resemble Lilly's accruing and large viewership. I do think YouTube and Late Night

01:27:38.280 --> 01:27:42.680
could have a close relationship, I think there's more opportunity in using a creator's personality

01:27:42.680 --> 01:27:46.520
and appeal in these spaces than there are in film and TV, but you have to understand that a lot of

01:27:46.520 --> 01:27:51.000
people don't just tune in for a name, you need to work with that personality and identity as well.

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:55.400
Perhaps a little late with Lilly Singh's second season, even if it didn't return the numbers to

01:27:55.400 --> 01:28:01.320
maintain its own survival, could provide a few ideas for agonising TV executives all over Hollywood.

01:28:01.320 --> 01:28:09.000
Lilly Singh- I'm a big believer that if you have blessings, you don't build a higher fence, you build a longer table.

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:15.400
I quite like Lilly Singh, not in the haha I think she's hilarious way, or even the yas queen slayer way.

01:28:15.400 --> 01:28:19.320
I don't think she always knew how to respond to people discussing her show, and I think she interpreted

01:28:19.320 --> 01:28:24.040
a lot of the criticism as bad faith, when really they probably had a point. I think she was part of

01:28:24.040 --> 01:28:29.000
the why can't everyone just get a long generation, and a lot of newer creators on YouTube just didn't

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:33.480
subscribe to that, which is why I think they clashed heads. I don't find her particularly funny, but

01:28:33.480 --> 01:28:38.120
then again I never really watched her content, and to be honest, neither did a lot of the people that

01:28:38.120 --> 01:28:42.600
roasted her. However, I don't think it's hard to see why people like her around, and enjoy her presence.

01:28:42.600 --> 01:28:46.040
She always seems to convey herself as someone who knows how to communicate with the world, and

01:28:46.040 --> 01:28:51.000
develop a strong, unique chemistry with those that were subject to her attention. Unlike other certain

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:56.200
hosts, you didn't need to manufacture a warm aesthetic, because Lilly was a naturally warm person,

01:28:56.200 --> 01:29:00.440
and you sometimes wonder if the studio has actually ever dealt with someone like that, who didn't need

01:29:00.440 --> 01:29:04.920
the prompts to have conversations. She didn't need to be told what to be interested about, because she

01:29:04.920 --> 01:29:09.480
was legitimately interested in things other than herself. She didn't need to be put inside the late

01:29:09.480 --> 01:29:12.360
night mould, she was there to break it.

01:29:35.640 --> 01:29:41.160
Alas, maybe a little late with Lilly seeing it wasn't meant to be, and it was cursed from the start.

01:29:41.160 --> 01:29:45.880
Maybe there was a right way to do it, but it just didn't happen, with networks suddenly failing to

01:29:45.880 --> 01:29:50.760
promote its longevity. It's hard for anyone to say if there was a way to turn it into the sensation

01:29:50.760 --> 01:29:56.040
it was imagined by some to be, but for a talk show, it did provide everyone with something to talk about,

01:29:56.040 --> 01:30:03.160
laugh about, satire, praise, criticise, debate, respond to, engage, and for some, to watch, support,

01:30:03.160 --> 01:30:07.400
find comfort in, perhaps find themselves a bit closer to a creator they looked up to.

01:30:07.400 --> 01:30:13.160
Even if it didn't turn the late night TV world upside down, and usher in a new era of YouTuber

01:30:13.160 --> 01:30:18.680
led shows, it still gave something to YouTube, and maybe that's all it needed to do.

01:30:20.920 --> 01:30:22.680
Thank you, and goodnight.

01:30:25.080 --> 01:30:30.200
So yeah, that was the video, I hope you all enjoyed it, I hope you all got something from it,

01:30:30.200 --> 01:30:35.080
and hopefully it inspires some productive discussion. I want to thank the editors,

01:30:35.080 --> 01:30:39.960
they've once again done a fantastic job, as always their credits will be in the pinned comments.

01:30:39.960 --> 01:30:45.160
I want to thank the post editors, Grumpy and Vic Grimes, fantastic work as always,

01:30:45.160 --> 01:30:49.880
they really came through after the original post editor had to drop out due to a very very sad

01:30:49.880 --> 01:30:56.200
situation, and sending my love to him as well, you know who you are. Thanks again for the background

01:30:56.200 --> 01:31:01.320
music as well, I assume that'll be Linuski, I'm not sure yet, but he always does a great job.

01:31:01.320 --> 01:31:06.920
Thumbnail as always, Starfo, fantastic work. I'd like to thank my Patrons, $10 patrons on the

01:31:06.920 --> 01:31:12.520
screen now, but I got some $50 patrons to thank as well, thank you again so much guys, Seri, Tish,

01:31:12.520 --> 01:31:18.040
Esther Bedoya, Hypercube, and Laura Woodward. I really appreciate the support and the belief it

01:31:18.040 --> 01:31:23.400
clearly represents, so thank you for that. Artists, if your artwork appears in this video,

01:31:23.400 --> 01:31:26.920
the credits should be in the pinned comment, but if it's not, just let me know and I'll add it.

01:31:26.920 --> 01:31:32.360
I also need to thank the sponsor, Scentbird, as you can tell, it's very hard for me to contain

01:31:32.360 --> 01:31:37.800
my enthusiasm. I don't really have much else to add, but I once again hope you enjoyed the video,

01:31:37.800 --> 01:31:40.680
and if you're still here, thank you for listening to me ramble.

01:31:40.680 --> 01:31:43.960
I'm The Right Opinion, and I will see you in the next one.
