0	13500	Hello, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with
13500	17400	too much free time, and YouTubers, although there are certainly a lot of them to choose
17400	20840	from, many would at least say the largest greats on the platform are comparable to the
20840	34320	everyday Hollywood celebrity. This seems increasingly accurate as the platform continues to manifest
34320	37900	and evolve larger and larger channels, headed by figures who have become identifiable to
37900	42000	even those without a passing interest in the video hosting website. YouTube isn't like
42000	45700	the mainstream media though, many figureheads are not handpicked, and many have much more
45700	49820	centralised control of their content and their vision than certain personages who may be
49820	54140	subject to studios and investors. For many, this is what makes YouTube such a good platform
54140	58500	to launch one's career, as success is almost exclusively decided by the audience who watch
58500	62660	it. However, on the other hand, YouTube is still a very small tranche of media as a whole,
62660	66340	and many who achieve the treasured status of mega influencer often begin to look beyond
66340	70140	the realms of the platform to further their career. In many ways, this should be a recipe
70140	73740	for success, the personal relationship that many creators produce with their channel often
73740	78020	gives them a fanbase much more dedicated than that of the average celeb utens. They've
78020	81820	already crafted a multi-million subscriber channel from a very limited set of resources,
81820	84900	imagine what they could do with the sort of financial backing that many of these large
84900	88980	corporations can provide. Think of all the wondrous creations that could be brought into
88980	97200	being. It's strange really, because in spite of the numerous attempts to bring popular
97200	101660	YouTubers into the mainstream sphere, a proportionally low number have actually succeeded. There
101660	105840	are a few large musicians and comedians who had their start on the video sharing platform,
105840	109440	which makes sense in a way as there are also occupations which can command an exceptionally
109440	113200	dedicated fanbase, but besides this, many creators trying to spread their wings have
113200	117520	often been met with limited prosperity outside of their comfort zone. Why is this often the
117520	118520	case?
118520	121680	Well, to be honest, I don't think it's really a problem with the YouTuber themselves.
121680	125140	As a matter of fact, many mainstream celebrities of the younger generations have been revealed
125140	128240	to have possessed YouTube channels at some point, even if they weren't particularly
128240	131680	lucrative in their time. It tells me that the same sort of star power that can drive
131680	135400	a mainstream celebrity can also drive many large YouTubers. I think the main problem
135400	138920	is rooted in the fact that many ventures by popular creators into mainstream media
138920	142800	seek to capitalise on their YouTube success without being sensitive to the format that
142800	146480	it's being adapted to. Although they may not seem particularly different on the surface,
146480	150720	a good comedy on YouTube works for very different reasons than a good comedy film works, and
150720	154840	the sort of five second humour that lands here may well fall flat elsewhere. A lot of
154840	158280	YouTube comedy thrives on spontaneity and randomness. If you want to translate that
158280	162480	into the world of established media, you still need infrastructure that supports it. Additionally,
162480	167080	the contrimences of a lot of entertainment content tend to subdue the appeal of the individual
167080	170720	creator, whose personality is often placed at the forefront of their online work, but
170720	174620	may otherwise fall into the background amongst elevated production values. It's not that
174620	177800	creators can't work in the mainstream world, it's just that the mainstream world often
177800	181520	doesn't know what to do with them, and the medium often isn't supportive of it. But
181520	201560	here's the answer to this quandary right in front of us the whole time. Lay Night
201560	205600	Talk shows one of the leading forms of media, particularly in the United States of America,
205600	209400	where figures like Jimmy Kimmel, David Letterman, and Conan O'Brien have been immortalised
209400	213680	by their eponymous programs. In the past few years, it has also found significant popularity
213680	217320	on YouTube, with clips from the broadcast garnering billions of views between them,
217320	221160	its standalone segments allowing for easy rendering to a site built on that sort of
221160	224320	content. Although the subjects are likely planned, prepared, and researched, there is
224320	228440	an impromptu element that allows the host to rip, which shows integrating sketches,
228440	232480	interviews, and audience interactions, all of which coast off the charisma of the presenter.
232480	236700	Its success on YouTube had already been proven, but what happens if we reverse the formula,
236700	251540	and put a YouTuber in a talk show? This is where we introduce today's title character,
251540	255060	a YouTuber by the name of Lilly Singh. Lilly Singh was one of the most prominent YouTube
255060	259260	cultivated comedians of the 2010s, a sketchy often garnished with commentary, but became
259260	263160	adored by many viewers for its ability to portray everyday experiences in an accurate
263160	266960	yet amusing fashion. She would regularly depict fictionalised figures, including her
266960	271240	overbearing conservative parents, and integrate her experiences as the second generation daughter
271240	276120	of migrants to Canada, contrasting their traditional values with her exposure to western culture.
276120	279360	This resonated with many around the world, and in the space of a few years, racked up
279360	283240	her channel over 10 million subscribers, becoming one of the most subscribed to channels in
283240	287520	the process. With such fame, further opportunities followed, with many of those expected for
287520	291100	some one of her influence. However, probably the most notable and well documented of those
291100	295380	was her role in the pioneering show A Little Late with Lilly Singh, which planned to take
295380	299560	her brand of YouTube comedy to a whole new level. With proven results, and a format that
299560	303900	should nurture her talents, it seemed like a match made in heaven. However, it felt like
303900	305900	as soon as it started, it was over.
305900	310500	Lilly Singh-"I believe in this show, because NBC believes in this show, but most importantly
310500	313220	because you believed in this show."
313220	317060	In spite of the promising premise, the show was nearly immediately marred in criticism,
317060	321160	controversy, and COVID, and after just two seasons, it was dropped from the ever-rotating
321160	325780	roster of late night shows, ending another YouTuber experiment with somewhat disappointing
325780	330500	results and leaving the question of the compatibility of YouTube's success hanging in the balance.
330500	334980	During the show's runtime, many creators and critics alike attempted to point out exactly
334980	339040	what didn't work about this show, but now with its fate sealed, I think we should revisit
339040	343260	it and ask that question one more time, to see if we can work out exactly what went wrong,
343260	347260	and to do that, I suggest we start with the person who made it all happen in the first place,
347260	352260	Lilly Singh. So folks, without further ado, let's jump right into it.
352260	361540	Wow guys, it's summer already. Gee, it's come around fast. Well, call me Nelly because it's hot in here.
361540	368980	All this sun is making me reconsider my life choices, such as my daily routine. Maybe you should reconsider your life too.
368980	372980	And think about ways to spruce it up. Have you noticed that you smell?
373620	380140	You know what also smells? Well, now introducing Scentbird, my new favourite brand of all time,
380140	386340	at least since my last video. When I go shopping looking for all my Gucci and Prada, my gold
386340	391980	chains, cashmere sweaters, and my grey Poupon, I'm always on the lookout for the finest
391980	400080	colognes, and I'm not talking about cities in North Rhine Westphalia, however, all these
400080	405380	bottles are so large. And what to confine you to one long-term relationship? What if
405380	410360	you want to sleep around? Well, Scentbird has you covered. They allow you to try up
410360	419360	to three travel-side designer or niche fragrances for just $17 a month. $17! That's like 0.00056

426920	432520	brands alongside cool other niche perfumes like Salt Air by Skyler, which really captures
432520	445920	the airiness and saltiness of an atmosphere with a degree of salinity. The Amberwood Tinge
445920	450120	Sign You're After You by Mercedes Benz, which captures the flavours of a man who always
450120	455380	lives life in the fast lane, and always keeps 12 points on his license. And the subtle spice
455380	461540	of number one, David's Perfume by David Debrick, for whenever you feel like a number one. I'm
461540	466840	sorry ladies, please control yourselves. Don't mind me friends, I just put some David Debrick
466840	472680	on me, and now everyone's getting excited. Huh, wait, where do they go? Anyhow, I know
472680	478180	I said $17 a month earlier, but I'm going to make you a deal. My friend Mr. Scentbird

502840	504840	They smell good.
533380	538080	Lilly Singh created her channel towards the end of 2010, with the first presently viewable upload being a
538080	543080	tutorial on how to tie a turban. Now it's not the first ever upload on her channel, we'll address that in a bit,
543080	547080	but I think it's understandable why she has left this up as the first upload. Although obviously very different
547080	551560	to the content she would subsequently garner fame from making, it represents a degree of cultural pride,
551560	556240	and integrates Lilly's more outgoing personality into the content, with a description that sets up Lilly's
556240	560520	purpose in the creation of this video, observing that there aren't a lot of tutorials that can deliver
560560	565560	information in a helpful way, and so she decided to fill that gap. When Lilly first launched her channel,
565560	570480	she tried a few avenues of content. There was music, including piano covers and rap remixes,
570480	575200	there was some serious commentary, and there were vlogs. Now, none of these performed particularly badly,
575200	578840	as a matter of fact, viewership was pretty consistent throughout the channel in its early stages.
578840	584320	However, the best performing video was a comedy one Lilly had made titled Stop Punjabi Madness, and not too long after,
584320	589080	she decided to take another shot at the funniest stuff, uploading a video named Official Guide to Brown Girls.
589800	593920	Today I'm going to tell you, welcome to Suboma's official guide of how to deal with brown girls.
593920	597480	So hold on tight, because you know it's going to be quite the emotional rollercoaster.
597480	600320	What's cooking good looking?
600320	605840	Obviously, much of its production value was very apt for that of 2010, but as personality, and even if some of the humor
605840	610360	is very much of its time, it's rooted in that trademark relatability that she'd soon become known for.
610360	614880	Additionally, even if a punchline or an edit didn't always land, there was no lack of comedic ambition,
614920	619480	and it demonstrated that Lilly was prepared to throw the kitchen sink at the wall just to see what stuck,
619480	624760	which can be a real asset to honing in your craft. After its publication, Official Guide to Brown Girls quickly
624760	629840	garnered significantly more views than any other video on her channel at that time, possibly giving Lilly a hint to what
629840	636640	the masses wanted, and so she obliged, uploading more sketch-based comedy to her channel in the coming months, and years.
636640	649840	I swear to God, you have one job, and that's to be sucky. You can't even suck. You make the worst slut ever.
649840	654640	Now in Lilly, there was no overnight success, particularly in the world of sketch comedy, which was already saturated by the
654640	660040	early 2010s. Plenty of channels dominated the airwaves, and it was hard for any creator to put their foot in the door.
660040	665120	But growth was steady, and enough of those who found her channel decided to subscribe and stick around for her content.
665160	670480	Playing the waiting game isn't necessarily a bad option in this case, as it gave Lilly time to improve her skills and creative
670480	675680	direction, improving viewer retention and subscriber conversion. This eventually began to pay dividends, particularly
675680	680680	around the year 2013, where her content began to be treated very favourably by the YouTube algorithm.
680680	686920	Starting the year on approximately 170,000 subscribers, she finished on 1.86 million, the sort of growth that many creators
686920	691880	can only dream of. By then, Lilly was producing highly polished videos that captured the energy of her humour,
691920	697320	or remaining sincere to the subject matter. She had fleshed out characters, running gags and social commentary from a defined
697320	703120	persona that commanded a large fanbase of dedicated viewers. Maybe we'll ask exactly how she did it, well we already spoke
703120	708360	about her appeal as a second generation daughter of migrants, but I think it went a little deeper than that. In the early 21st century,
708360	712840	the age of the internet was dawning in many countries, which were certainly not used to having such contraption at their
712840	718160	disposal. The internet gave young people in their formative years a lot of accessibility to ideas and media that they
718160	723040	would never have had the chance to appreciate without the world wide web. However, a lot of this media came into very
723040	728560	significant conflict with values held by older generations, those whose perspectives had been formed and cemented a long
728560	734040	time ago, and who probably did not interact with that sort of media well. The conflict was the source of tension in a lot of
734040	739920	families, and was very much documented for its time. In Lilly's case, her exposure to western culture was part of growing up in
739920	744960	Canada, but all over the world, with the increasing access to the online world and social media, people were having the exact
744960	751040	same experiences, ones that were encompassed by Lilly's content. In a 2012 interview, when asked about reasons for starting
751040	756240	her channel, Lilly replied, one inspiration was definitely the fact that there was no female doing it, particularly an Indian
756240	761680	female doing it. Lilly was right in way, although it's obviously an exaggeration to an extent. There were female comedians
761680	767640	who uploaded to YouTube, and some who had accrued considerable success doing so, such as Jenna Marbles. Nonetheless, the lion's share
767640	773240	of the market was controlled by male led channels. It's nothing against those channels, but there's only so many people you can
773240	779240	appeal to from that angle that many of those creators were making videos from. If Ian and Anthony from Smosh began to upload
779240	784680	content and wanted to be a brown girl, I think viewers would be understandably confused, but for a long time, people would
784680	791120	interpret that lack of representation as a lack of demand in a certain market. Yet by the end of 2014, Lilly's channel,
791120	798040	iiSuperwomanii, possessed just shy of 5 million subscribers, over 80% of whom were female, with many likely from a diverse
798040	803440	range of ethnic backgrounds. Those sorts of statistics spoke volumes. Nevertheless, Lilly's successes were also being
803440	809000	recognised outside of her subscriber count. 2014 brought her nominations for both the Shorty and Streamy Awards,
809000	814040	collaborations with renowned celebrities, a multitude of interviews where she detailed her background and rise to stardom,
814040	820000	and regular guest spots at popular conventions. Coming off the year, Singh appeared in the 2014 rewind amongst many of the
820000	825920	platform's then largest creators, cementing her status as YouTube royalty. It was clear that on her current trajectory, she was
825920	831560	destined to be one of the website's leading lights. However, some of Lilly's ambition was never going to be merely settled on
831560	837680	what she had, and heading into 2015, it was clear she had greater plans. In her time as a content creator, she had appeared in a few
837680	843240	films and music videos, particularly those in Indian media, which although not major, definitely reflected her desire to expand
843240	848640	into the mainstream industry as a whole. As early uploads on her channel showed, she had always had the hunger for all types of
848640	854560	creative content, and now she was about to fully realise it. Lilly Singh was about to go global.
856920	865920	In the space of a few years, Lilly Singh had built a YouTube empire, but it's clear that she wanted more, and who could blame her?
865920	874160	Lilly Singh- I'm gonna take you all on a trip to Unicorn Island with my first ever world tour!
874160	879520	The thing about YouTube is that success is fleeting for most creators, there are exceptions, and likely people who will remain on
879520	884920	YouTube for a rather long time to come, people who enjoy their work here. But for many who want more from the entertainment
884920	891000	world, YouTube is just the start. This was definitely the case for Lilly Singh. In March 2015, she embarked on a world tour
891000	896440	called A Trip to Unicorn Island, which integrated her various talents and interests into one comprehensive performance.
896440	902080	Now tours are certainly not out of the ordinary for a creator of her size, however, she also decided to chronicle this circuit with a
902080	907360	documentary feature film which shared its name with the tour itself. It was released the following year to mix reviews from
907360	913040	critics and audiences, but was likely well received by her devotees as a raw glimpse into the person behind the entertainer,
913080	918760	including covering the struggles of content creation. Throughout the year, she began to win awards and receive more coverage
918760	924480	from various mainstream media outlets. She won a Streamy and an MTV Fandom Award, and made the top 10 on Forbes' highest
924480	929960	earning YouTube stars of that year. This was the perfect time to eye up Hollywood, which was exactly what she was doing.
929960	937160	In a 2015 LA Times interview, Singh stated that she intended to move to La La Land by November. She doesn't state why, but I think we
937160	942280	can make a reasonable assumption it wasn't for the affordable housing. Come the new year, it's what she had done, and not too
942280	946280	soon after, she began to increasingly appear across the entertainment industry as a whole.
966280	971720	With Lea's success, it wasn't hard to understand why she was so sought after. She commanded a large fanbase who would readily
971720	976920	watch whatever she was credited just to point her out, she had a proven record of being able to hold her own as a performer,
976920	982360	and she was some of the hottest product on the scene at the time. However, Hollywood was a very different can of worms to YouTube,
982360	987400	and whereas Lily was one of the largest influencers at the time on the video sharing platform, she was still a relatively small
987400	993080	fish in Hollywood. Many creatives had pioneered the industry before her, and her experience, although no less inherently
993080	997840	meaningful, was set against an industry full of people who had already broken the ground that she walked on.
997840	1004400	YouTube had been around for just over a decade, Hollywood had existed for over a century. With this in mind, although you'd
1004400	1009680	certainly be impressed to read a repertoire of her media appearances, she never made any performances that felt particularly
1009680	1015760	memorable. Her roles weren't derisory by any means, but they didn't represent that guarantee of longevity that so many budding
1015760	1021840	stars aspired for. One of the most promising prospects was an NBC show by the name of Bright Futures, which was set to have
1022000	1028080	and another YouTube breakout star, Jimmy Tatro, playing young friends all attempting to realise their careers. Unfortunately, this
1028080	1032480	was scrapped not too long after it was conceived, serving a rather bitter blow to those involved.
1032480	1038480	We'd seen it before, a YouTuber goes to Hollywood, manages a few minor speaking roles in studio productions, and then mostly
1038480	1043520	fades away when the novelty of their presence wears off, and after the first few acting roles, there probably were those who
1043520	1048040	wondered if Lily Singh would be assigned to the same category, but there were signs this wasn't the case.
1048040	1050520	I love who I am, and that's when I decide I'm a boss.
1050520	1052520	Yeah, see?
1052520	1059240	In March 2017, she published her first autobiography, How To Be A Boss, A Guide To Conquering Life.
1059240	1065480	Going off the synopsis, it looks like a crash course in fulfilling Maslow's pyramids of needs. However, that's not necessarily a bad
1065480	1070600	thing, and a lot of people seem to agree, boring itself to the number one spot on the New York Times bestseller list.
1070600	1075720	She hosted a successful world tour to promote the book, all while continuing to work on her projects for her YouTube channel and
1076360	1080600	Although she hadn't quite defined her career yet, it felt like she was on the right trajectory.
1080600	1085000	I'd say the most important aspect of her status in Hollywood was that of a public figure in general.
1085000	1090600	As her old content had layered more social commentary than a lot of her contemporaries, she carried more social clout than a lot of
1090600	1096360	other YouTube figures who had tried to change lanes. Her history of being outspoken regarding many causes, including mental
1096360	1101560	health, the treatment of women, and the representation of marginalized groups in media, had garnered her the reputation that
1101560	1107160	she could be a good ambassador for many noble causes. It meant people often wanted to listen to what she had to say, and her
1107160	1113960	success only emboldened this observation. In 2017, she became a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador, a role occupied by celebrities
1113960	1120120	such as David Beckham, Katy Perry, and Jackie Chan. Singh's role specialized in advocating for children's rights, and she
1120120	1122120	addressed the United Nations the following year.
1122120	1130360	Now getting to where I am today and achieving this level of success was not easy, but when I compare myself to the circumstances
1130360	1137560	of what the majority of young people face, to be honest, I feel like I practically won the lottery. I got to receive an
1137560	1145080	education, I got support, I didn't have to face obstacles such as poverty, conflict, or failed institutions.
1145080	1150760	She also used this authority to represent the online world and their often divisive sense of humor, tickling countries that
1150760	1156360	weren't necessarily the most free speech oriented. It was clear that Lily meant business. She began to acquire a fair few roles
1156360	1162760	that didn't necessarily rely on comedy, but more on her own natural self and background. She collaborated with Smashbox Cosmetics,
1162760	1168760	Calvin Klein, Ardennes, and Pantene just to name a few, and appeared alongside many other famous females in Maroon 5's song
1168760	1174840	Girls Like You. With creators from the world of YouTube, there was a sense that many just wouldn't translate into being engaging
1174840	1181320	celebrities, and sometimes that was the case, but Lily was a departure from that. Her roles in film and TV didn't seem like they
1181320	1186120	were going to make her a star in their own rights, but as she became more ingrained in Hollywood culture, her
1186120	1191240	status as an outgoing person who could hold a friendly conversation, but also deliver some strong social messaging,
1191240	1197000	provided her with a different kind of appeal, one that did transcend most fleeting pop culture bullshit, and with that sort of
1197000	1201640	brand and the proven success that had come with it, there was a genre that seemed like a good fit.
1201640	1205160	Welcome to the Late Late Show everybody.
1205160	1206200	Let's talk about it.
1206200	1216920	Talk shows are a genre that I've addressed before. Although I focus more on the daytime genre rather than nights, they do share a lot of
1216920	1222760	similarities, so I don't want to repeat myself too much. However, besides the obvious aesthetic differences, I'd say late night
1222760	1228840	talk shows play off a stricter blueprint than a lot of their daytime counterparts. Now, there is variety, and each late night host
1228840	1234040	has their own personal flair, but most played a pretty safe game as long as the numbers they pulled were satisfactory enough.
1234040	1239160	Another key difference I'd say about late night talk show hosts is that many of them leaned into social commentary more
1239160	1244520	heavily than their daytime counterparts, being able to dispense an opinion on a controversial matter was becoming
1244520	1249480	increasingly sought after, especially in a world where current affairs were becoming more and more emotionally provocative
1249480	1255480	subjects. In the past few decades, the media industry in general has increasingly diversified its roster of figureheads,
1255480	1261000	however with a few exceptions, late night talk shows have mostly remained dominated by a very specific type of person.
1261000	1265320	It's also important to note that many of these hosts had been on the air for over a decade, and although there's nothing
1265320	1270680	wrong with the media stalwart, by the end of the 2010s there was a huge untapped demographic, as a majority of younger
1270680	1276520	generations were consuming content from sources outside of cable TV. Now, late night talk shows had long held
1276520	1282760	their own on YouTube. As a matter of fact, Lilly Singh's appearances on 2014 and 2015 Rewind were alongside a fair few
1282760	1288040	late night hosts as well. This is in part because of YouTube's long-standing relationship with late night TV. NBC
1288040	1293160	partnered with YouTube in 2006, and some credit the variety of late night clips as playing a role in Google's
1293160	1298440	acquisition of YouTube. To this day, many major networks have contracts with the video sharing platform for monetization
1298440	1303480	and adsense, with network executives viewing YouTube as a distribution partner, and with some channels scoring up to
1303480	1309400	250 million views a month, it's hard to see it as anything else. As noted, late night talk shows have always
1309400	1314760	coasted off the individual personality more than a lot of other broadcasts. The rancors were able to build a rapport
1314760	1319320	with the live audience and YouTube viewer alike, and although you'd be hard pressed to say they had the sort of
1319320	1324600	relationship with their subscribers that many content creators did, there were obvious parallels, and their presence
1324600	1329720	on the YouTube platform was notably greater than other TV programs. However, in spite of its popularity on the
1329720	1335080	video sharing platform, the genre was still mostly removed from YouTube in its presentation, still playing to what
1335080	1340440	they knew best. For a lot of late night talk shows, that sort of stability in a highly competitive industry was
1340520	1345560	something the executive valued, but even after the ratings spike that the election of Donald Trump provided them,
1345560	1350600	there were still signs that current popularity was waning a little. Late night needed a fresh face on the scene.
1350600	1355640	YouTube was a good litmus test for what the market enjoyed without the boardrooms and arbitrations.
1355640	1360840	It was like a mass focus group, if the right kind of figure on YouTube could hold down their entire channel,
1360840	1362840	then who knows what else they could be capable of.
1362840	1371080	They don't know you, how giant you are on YouTube. 7.6 million subscribers, over 1 billion views. 1 billion.
1372360	1380600	You were named in Forbes 30 under 30, and you just did a worldwide tour, 27 cities and 31 shows. Congratulations, pal.
1380600	1382840	Thank you so much, thank you. Well done.
1382840	1387480	Lee Singh seemed like the prime candidate for that sort of role. She had a proven record on YouTube and in
1387480	1392200	Hollywood, not just as an entertainer and a comedian, but also as a person whose words held relative value
1392200	1396360	in their circles, who would intertwine that social commentary with those amusing anecdotes.
1396360	1400760	The increasing diversification of the market around her, yet the lack of representation on the late night
1400760	1405880	circuit left a comfortable niche for her to fill. However, that opening would need to present itself first.
1405880	1412040	But that was just around the corner. The year is 2019, and NBC were just wrapping up the long-term
1412040	1416920	talk show Last Call with Carson Daly. Daly wished to focus on his other TV projects more, and felt
1416920	1421800	that the talk show had run its course after 17 rather fruitful years. The NBC chairman sensed
1421800	1426520	an opportunity, stating to interviewers that he saw the time slot's potential to become a creative
1426520	1431400	playground, which would focus more on relevancy in the digital age. The alleged first choice of
1431400	1436760	the studio was Chrissy Teigen, but she declined, and not too long after, the producer of Conan,
1436760	1440680	John Irwin, proposed Singh as a possible replacement, citing her ability to balance
1440680	1444920	comedy and serious commentary. Lilly had previously appeared with Conan, so Irwin seemed like a
1444920	1449480	reasonable enough source, and with this in mind, NBC approached Singh, and together with her company
1449480	1454280	Unicorn Island Productions, began to plan out what would become A Little Late with Lilly Singh.
1454280	1458520	The MO was clear, the political commentary of many talk show hosts had taken up enough space,
1458520	1462760	so Lilly would supposedly be replicating what had made her YouTube channel such a success,
1462760	1467320	the comedic portrayal and narrative surrounding her experiences and unique background. On paper,
1467320	1471400	this made a lot of sense, I said that earlier Ian and Anthony from Smosh couldn't speak about their
1471400	1476600	experiences as a brown girl, well neither could Jimmy Fallon, Stephen Colbert, or James Corden,
1476600	1480360	and the fact was that the format of late night shows allowed narratives to be based around the
1480360	1484440	host, and Singh should have been able to bring some fresh perspectives to what was then a very
1484440	1490200	tired genre. When news of this broke, it was met with hope, intrigue, and some skepticism, for many
1490200	1494280	Lilly represented a new generation of talk show hosts, she was the first ever late night presenter
1494280	1498920	to openly identify as bisexual, hell on announcement she was going to be the only female
1498920	1503240	heading up a major late night program, and even though she wasn't the first, this news was met
1503240	1507240	with praise by many who felt that the current register of TV hosts left a fair bit to be
1507240	1511640	desired. For some, regardless of what she said, Lilly Singh was already going to be a breath of
1511640	1516600	fresh air in an atmosphere that for some had grown very stale. However, although many welcomed this
1516600	1521240	news, there was still an air of uncertainty as to whether her signature flair would translate into
1521240	1525400	such a format. It was true that there were a lot of similarities between being the face of a YouTube
1525400	1529640	channel and being the face of a talk show, but there was also one key difference, that being
1529640	1534360	talk shows are just much higher production value, and although that can often be a positive facet,
1534360	1539240	can sacrifice the homegrown charm and spontaneity of a YouTube channel. Lilly would have a full
1539240	1543640	camera crew, script writers, producers, and she did obviously have her own studio involved as
1543640	1547480	well, but there was the lingering question of how much she could make the talk show her own
1547480	1552360	with so many other hands involved. Lilly showed that she could make it into Hollywood, but she
1552360	1556760	never did it using the exact same skill set that had garnered her a following on YouTube.
1556760	1562120	The news that she would be utilising that YouTube basis once more could be for better or for worse,
1562120	1566440	but at this stage one could only speculate. In this case, the proof of the pudding was
1566440	1572200	in the eating. But did people have the appetite for it? Well, there was only one way to find out.
1582360	1590280	On the 12th September, a channel by the name of A Little Late with Lilly Singh posted a YouTube
1590280	1595560	video titled How Lilly Singh Really Built Her Show. It fabricates a rather far-fetched story
1595560	1599720	about the origins of A Little Late, but drops the necessary details that would be required to
1599720	1603800	understand the show. It also provides an impression of the sort of sketches that Lilly might be
1603800	1629400	performing. It definitely integrates some of her commentary elements from her videos,
1629400	1633400	but seems to do it more in a running narrative format, whereas in the past her commentary for
1633400	1637800	content had felt more like a voiceover. This style seemed to aim to assimilate the two more,
1637800	1642120	and overall viewers seemed to enjoy it with many devotees commenting their appreciation.
1642120	1646280	It was only a day later that NBC actually released a preview on their own network,
1646280	1650280	showing that Lilly clearly still valued using YouTube as a platform, and it should have been
1650280	1655560	a sign of good things to come. A Little Late with Lilly Singh made its debut on the 16th September
1655560	1660040	with an opening monologue that touched on her heritage, her background, and her status amongst
1660040	1663560	many other late-night hosts who she was sharing the scene with. Lilly Singh- Look, I get it,
1663560	1668360	okay? I'm not your traditional talk show host. I mean, the media has mentioned I'm a bisexual
1668360	1673400	woman of colour so much that I feel like I should just change my name. A little long,
1673400	1679480	but it has a nice ring to it. Come on, I'm more than just a bisexual woman of colour, okay? It's
1679480	1685080	a complete coincidence that I chose a network whose logo is also the Pride flag. The set seems
1685080	1689560	almost designed to create the atmosphere of a late-night comedy club, one which places Lilly
1689560	1693080	at the forefront of the stand-up scene as she delivers jokes that wouldn't seem out of place
1693080	1697560	for that sort of environment. Alongside her gags, visual aids appeared on screen for viewers to
1697560	1701640	provide some additional humour, though sometimes it felt a bit on the nose for what it was trying
1701640	1707800	to explain. Lilly- I mean, real talk, if you put every network late-night host in one room together,
1708440	1713640	and then add me and Hasan Minhaj, we look like the IT department at their law firm's customs party.
1714600	1718520	This format was accompanied by interviews, the first episodes being with writer and actor Mindy
1718520	1723480	Kaling, though Office co-star Rainn Wilson makes a brief appearance too. Alongside some sketches,
1723480	1728920	most notably one baptised Lilly Singh Knocks Down the Door of Late Night, which featured Lilly
1728920	1732920	performing one of her signature raps, explaining why she is not like other late-night talk show
1732920	1735080	hosts, all while girl-bossing it to the top.
1735080	1743640	Lilly- Hello my name is Lilly, and I ain't a white man. My skin got some colour, and it ain't a spray tan.
1743640	1749800	I know you're used to only jimmies in the spotlight, but I'ma throw some melanin up in your late night.
1749800	1753960	Alongside the release of this first episode was a flurry of promotional campaigns, including
1753960	1757800	appearances on other late-night TV shows. She could do this as unlike other late-night hosts,
1757800	1762200	her shows weren't actually broadcast live, and had all been pre-recorded to fit in with her hectic
1762200	1765880	schedule. Overall, the promotional campaign seemed to work, as the clips on her YouTube
1765880	1769400	channel appeared to garner significant traction, but what would the reviews say?
1769400	1773400	Well, many critics seemed to laud her fresh perspective and approach on late-night television,
1773400	1777560	some going as far as to label it revolutionary. There were some critics who didn't enjoy a
1777560	1781480	staccato interviewing style of Mindy, never really allowing the conversation to gather
1781480	1785880	substantial flow, and some weren't a fan of certain YouTubisms that she had brought over.
1786680	1791160	I start like, I'm being like, yeah, yeah, I was like that in high school too, you know,
1791160	1797640	which is like not true at all. And even the like dorks in Euphoria would have been Miss America.
1797640	1802200	They're so hot. No, 100% when I watch a show, I'm like, you're all so hot. You have two eyebrows,
1802200	1806760	what's that about? I didn't have that in high school. I didn't have that at all.
1806760	1810520	Now, critics aren't exactly the sort of people Lily was expecting to appease completely,
1810520	1813960	and maybe some of these professional reviewers were just a bit too old to understand such
1813960	1818600	aesthetic choices. The most important question pertained to what those on her native platform
1818600	1824920	thought, the people who she was meant to appeal to. Well, it wasn't exactly unanimous positivity.
1824920	1828120	Her opening monologue and sketch were the clips that attracted the most criticism,
1828120	1831240	with many finding the humour too heavy-handed and repetitive.
1838760	1843160	As you probably noticed, there are a few references to her unique status as a bisexual
1843160	1847160	minority on the telly, and although that was a breath of fresh air in the current environment,
1847160	1851960	some felt that it had become the basis for too many jokes, some of which seemed to imply that
1851960	1856200	people would be offended to see someone of her ethnicity on stage, which doesn't really make
1856200	1860680	sense given other figures that came before her. With this in mind, commenters seemed to feel that
1860680	1865000	she was giving herself a bit too much credit, others just found the humour rather cringe,
1865000	1869560	in particular rap, which despite being based on early YouTube content, didn't seem to land with
1869560	1874120	the grace that those videos had done so before. It seems that those from mainstream media and
1874120	1878360	those from YouTube both saw very different issues with Lilly Singh's show. Whereas some from the
1878360	1882520	mainstream felt that certain technical choices didn't feel in keeping with late night talk shows
1882520	1886600	at the time, many viewers just felt that the humour fell flat as a whole. Now we know that
1886600	1890920	critics and audiences often look for different elements in media, that's why the scores can
1890920	1895640	sometimes be extremely different. However, I think although both sects of the internet had their own
1895640	1900120	qualms with the show, most would agree that the general critical consensus was far more positive
1900120	1904920	than the audience one. Now many would argue that critical approach is much more important than the
1904920	1909480	opinions of those on the internet, as critics do their job professionally, and many look towards
1909480	1914520	critical reviews before making decisions on what shows to tune into. However, Lilly Singh's decision
1914520	1919000	to make parts of her show immediately available to viewers online made much of the critical response
1919000	1923560	redundant, as a YouTube clip could typically encompass an entire sketch, rather than a small
1923560	1928280	segment from a film per se, a prospective audience member would be able to make a much more holistic
1928280	1931960	judgement on whether this was something worth watching, and it was clear that for some that
1931960	1936440	simply wasn't the case. Nonetheless, although YouTube comments and like dislike ratings can
1936440	1940280	reflect the response of a certain audience, they don't have too much individual bearing on the
1940280	1944440	well for every TV show. If certain viewers don't like it, they don't have to watch it.
1944440	1949320	Maybe this show simply wasn't for them. However, that was not enough for some.
1949640	1956440	I feel like a lot of people may be a little bit upset that the entire four minutes of this is just
1957080	1959640	random jokes about race.
1959640	1962760	And maybe Lilly's background was coming back to bite her.
1968520	1973160	By 2019, there was quite a significant space on YouTube for media criticism in general.
1973160	1976840	It was particularly popular with the rise of reaction-infused content in this genre,
1976840	1980200	mainly due to the increasing accessibility of source material as a whole.
1980200	1984440	Most of this originated from YouTube or other platforms such as TikTok, and normally entailed
1984440	1989240	a commentator explaining which teen idol couldn't actually sing. However, this had also extended
1989240	1992600	into the realm of talk shows in the past, particularly with the popularity of shows like
1992600	1996840	Dr. Phil, who also held a relatively strong YouTube presence. Nevertheless, in spite of
1996840	2001160	their often considerable view count, late night talk show hosts were never subject to too much
2001160	2006040	commentary, mainly because of how inoffensive their core content was. Lilly Singh's content
2006040	2009800	wasn't particularly offensive either, and in many ways, the negative response experienced
2009800	2013560	to the first episode of her show could have been ephemeral, and yet it wasn't.
2015320	2019240	In fact, over the following weeks, the widespread lampooning of many of the clips from her opening
2019240	2024040	show went viral across the platform, mainly because of how many topical debates it seemed to hit.
2024040	2028760	It's crazy, like it's very groundbreaking because, you know, it's always just been pasty white dudes,
2028760	2034120	you know, that's always been the trend, it's always been that, and now it's like, finally, finally!
2034120	2037240	And I don't think there would have been any buzz, I don't think anybody would have a problem with it,
2037240	2042120	but her and her team made the big mistake of just making it all about that, making it all about her
2042120	2048280	being a woman of color, like, look at me, and move over, move over, white people! It's the brown
2048280	2052120	woman's gain now! There were obviously those who had a political angle on it, particularly
2052120	2056520	with much of the human being identity-based, but videos on these subjects spanned across
2056520	2060920	all genres. As noted, one of the major criticisms from online viewers was that Lilly's jokes were
2060920	2065880	rather awkward, or cringe, which I think is a detail worth noting down, because as I'm sure we all know,
2065880	2070440	as excruciating as it can be to watch, cringe is a great source of views for a lot of creators,
2070440	2075560	even in a format as basic as cringe compilations, which are accompanied by no commentary whatsoever.
2075560	2076520	THE VACCINE!
2079640	2081080	Shut the fuck up.
2081080	2085720	But let's be honest, a lot of late night shows have their unfunny moments, especially unfunny to
2085720	2089640	a lot of netizens at least. Cringe comedy is off to the heart of a lot of these shows,
2089640	2093160	what was so special about Lilly Singh? Well, there are a few reasons this became such a
2093160	2097240	perfect storm of publicity. The first was simply because it was a new show on the block, whenever
2097240	2101080	something new happens, there is always a gap in the market for those who react to it, so almost
2101080	2104440	immediately there were a fair few videos that provided their thoughts on Lilly's new venture,
2104440	2108840	most of which, as we know now, were not the most praising. From there on, it's a domino effect of
2108840	2113160	reaction videos. Secondly, Lilly's choice to use YouTube as a platform to prioritize distribution
2113160	2117080	of her content cut out the risk of certain negative, critical, or word-of-mouth opinions
2117080	2121000	restricting viewership. However, this backfired because then people's only interest in watching
2121000	2125640	reviews or reactions to her content was for entertainment purposes, which bolstered content
2125640	2129880	taking the piss out of her show. Most people don't read critical reviews for entertainment,
2129880	2133720	they will watch a YouTube video though, and they were available in spades.
2133720	2137480	It's pretty generally accepted that negative content will attract more views as a whole,
2137480	2142040	and is often the basis for more effective YouTube comedy, so it's little surprise that many aspiring
2142040	2146600	comedians saw it as just that. Then you have to consider her status as a large YouTube figure,
2146600	2151320	one that magnifies such relevance only further. For some mysterious reason, possibly related to
2151320	2156040	view count, though I couldn't possibly say why, many YouTubers enjoy talking about other YouTubers
2156040	2160440	more than they do people of other mediums, and a YouTuber trying their hand at something else?
2160440	2164840	Oh well, that was a goldmine waiting to happen. However, one cannot blame environmental factors
2164840	2169000	alone for the scrutiny that the show found itself under. Although it's fair to say that certain
2169000	2173240	missteps would have probably been overlooked if they occurred elsewhere, they weren't here.
2173320	2177880	So, Lily, for your first episode, we're thinking you enter in a nice grey suit.
2177880	2181240	Grey? I prefer something a little more colourful, obviously.
2181240	2184520	Yeah, so do I. I like a pink one. Oh, you mean...
2187000	2188360	You don't mean it like that, do you?
2188360	2192360	Lee Sing-e presents herself as a champion for those underrepresented in media. She obviously
2192360	2197800	didn't explicitly say that, well, not too much, but by highlighting that aspect of her identity
2197800	2201640	and positioning herself as a figure on social commentary, she placed herself in a role that
2201640	2205320	was often held to quite rigorous standards. At the same time, she had built a lot of her
2205320	2209080	success on jokes about her own race. Watching her shows always felt like she was trying to
2209080	2213800	balance calling out certain stereotypes while also using them as joke fuel in other contexts.
2213800	2218760	I am so happy to be here, and by the looks of it, a lot of you are happy to be here too.
2219960	2222200	It's mostly the brown people because this was free to attend.
2222200	2225240	Probably the most notable incident in the first month of airing was when she made a
2225240	2228600	passing comment about towers on some children's heads resembling turbans.
2229000	2232440	Their hair really quickly. So, you know, it's a very practical thing.
2232440	2235560	I think they definitely had the turvy twist on when they...
2238280	2241960	This part raised more backlash at the time and Sing-e quickly apologized for this. It's
2241960	2245320	a sort of comment that probably would have flown under the radar on her YouTube channel,
2245320	2248920	particularly given her Sikh background. But here, every joke that could be interpreted
2248920	2254120	somewhat negatively was put under the magnifying glass. Even jokes that weren't necessarily her own,
2254120	2256040	which caused some controversy in itself.
2272760	2277480	This wasn't aided by the format of publication. With the traditional presentation of TV shows,
2277480	2281000	reception would be quite linear, talk shows are a hard craft of effects,
2281080	2284280	and it would be natural for someone's first episode to have a fair few hiccups.
2284280	2287960	However, people's attention would quickly move on to the second episode when it's released.
2287960	2291480	With YouTube, if a clip is notorious enough, it can provide discourse for months,
2291480	2295480	and therefore YouTube will prioritize it in the algorithm. So even though there were many more
2295480	2299320	clips uploaded to YouTube in the weeks after the first episode, people were still more likely to
2299320	2302840	receive an impression from the content that had provoked the greatest reaction earlier,
2302840	2306920	and although that may not have been representative of her shows, that was what was happening,
2306920	2311880	and by mid-October discourse had manifested into this incessant dunking on a few select clips that
2311880	2315800	were nearly a month old, but seemed to find new life every time a creator reacted to the
2315800	2320280	war Lily made a faux pas. Her content was essentially experiencing a negative variety
2320280	2324120	of sorts, with figures from all over the content spectrum chiming in on the matter.
2324120	2328360	YouTube, the platform that had not just launched Lily's illustrious career, but had seemed central
2328360	2332840	to the marketing of this new late-night venture, had seemingly reacted in the worst way possible,
2332840	2336920	but Lily herself, a YouTube megastar, would surely understand this scenario,
2336920	2341640	and know how to react accordingly, at least better than most Hollywood superstars, right?
2342280	2344360	So, how would she respond?
2344360	2349320	The reviews are from places like the Atlantic, Variety, CNN, Decider, Cosmopolitan, Deadline,
2349320	2352520	whereas before there were negative reviews from like, Angry Virgins.
2353400	2353900	Well.
2359960	2364520	Now as noted, Lily's show was pre-recorded, therefore it would be fair to question if Lily
2364520	2369080	could even adjust the objective of her broadcast on the basis of this response. Well you see,
2369080	2374520	it was pre-recorded as aforementioned, but all in late 2019, so they were still recording after
2374520	2379160	viewers watched and imparted their opinion of early episodes, and this did give Lily a platform
2379160	2383160	to respond to those who found her humour cringe, or didn't approve of its messaging.
2383160	2385080	So, how would she? Well.
2402680	2406200	At first she didn't appear to be too bothered, mostly ignoring any criticism,
2406200	2410520	unless it was proper controversy such as the turbo comment, however over time she did appear
2410520	2414760	to be paying more attention to what people said. At first mocking the comments in the above clip,
2414760	2419240	but barely a few days after that episode had aired, Lily took to Twitter in a rather sour mood.
2419240	2421320	Her tweet on October 22nd read,
2436200	2441960	In a way this statement isn't entirely false, we've seen a lot of creators
2441960	2446680	consumed by negativity because of the topics of their content, if you deal with the worst people,
2446680	2451640	sometimes you begin to see the worst in people. However, I think the problem is that this seemed
2451640	2457000	like a passive aggressive response to the people criticising, or making fun of her show, which
2457000	2461480	for a lot of people, really was not that deep. Now Lily is entitled to say whatever she wished
2461480	2465400	to say, but she must have had some grasp on how this would provoke further response,
2465400	2468920	and just like clockwork it did, because if there's one type of person on the internet
2468920	2473720	loves to dunk on more than people trying to be funny but being cringe, it's people who can't
2473720	2477960	take criticism, and Lily seemed like one of those people right then, with many providing
2477960	2481560	recent responses to distinguishing hate from legitimate criticism.
2481560	2485640	She goes on a big rant about why drama channels are bad, and she actually finishes the tweet with
2485640	2490120	a message to the only people who can stand her content. Young kids, don't follow this example,
2490120	2493560	it's not good for the soul or the longevity of your career, don't make me do it Lily,
2493560	2496840	you're really tempting me here, don't make me shorten my own career span.
2496840	2501240	I think her replies annoy people in the way that it almost demonstrated a lack of understanding
2501240	2505480	in how YouTube operated and thrived, which as a former YouTuber you'd think she would
2505480	2509640	have an abundance of. Sure, the website had evolved in the years since Lily had pursued
2509640	2514120	her Hollywood dreams, but it still operated on the same tenets that she had found success with.
2514120	2518680	Most of the viewers who watched her content and supported her career didn't just disappear from
2518680	2523160	the platform, they hadn't been consumed by the negativity, they just no longer followed
2523160	2527560	her with the same enthusiasm they had in the past. This response may have been one that was
2527560	2531240	rooted in frustration at public response to her content, she clearly didn't feel it was
2531240	2535480	representative of the show as a whole, and she probably had a point, but rather than just
2535480	2539720	suggesting that people watch more of the show, it was almost a tit for tat, she had to cherry
2539720	2543080	pick responses and strawman perspectives to get even with her haters.
2543080	2563320	But
2563320	2567960	maybe she did know, maybe she did realise that this was the sort of response that such statements
2567960	2572840	would provoke. Perhaps in a way she saw the online criticism as potential free promotion for future
2572840	2576920	episodes. This theory would make sense in a way because every time the coverage on YouTube had
2576920	2581000	the potential to die a death, Lily would make some sort of public acknowledgement of it, and creators
2581000	2584840	would feel inclined to issue further responses, probably the most notable one of these coming
2584840	2589320	from a creator by the name of Drew Gooden, whose video Leaving the YouTube Bubble has amassed over
2589320	2593720	15 million views, and is the second most viewed video on his channel. That's a lot of people
2593720	2597880	talking about Lily Singh, I think you could easily look at many of the late night controversies and
2597880	2602200	think that actually sometimes leaning into the controversial side of you can generate a lot of
2602200	2606280	views. Hell, it had worked pretty successfully for some late night hosts whose views had stagnated
2606280	2618680	at points. Some would argue that this was just modern day marketing, that as long as people were
2618680	2623080	talking about her she had done her job, and for a while it obviously worked. However, I think the
2623080	2627480	point of farming criticism is that it really depends who you're farming it from. With other late
2627480	2631320	night hosts, a lot of their content received negative attention from people who were never
2631320	2635480	going to watch their show anyway, particularly given the fact that they often utilised political
2635480	2639560	topics that were designed to be divisive. With Lily, some of the criticism was coming
2639560	2643960	from her own target audience, and much of it wasn't merely based on her political opinions.
2643960	2648200	Now, a fair few criticisms towards Lily were politically motivated, especially people who
2648200	2652440	felt her humour was racist, but there were a lot of general criticisms as well relating to
2652440	2657160	presentation and execution of the show, criticisms that I don't think would have necessarily existed
2657160	2660840	if they weren't issues to begin with. Additionally, even some politically motivated
2660840	2665000	criticisms came from audiences who you'd think would appreciate her more progressive sense of
2665000	2669000	humour, particularly those who felt she was appropriating certain cultures, or that her
2669000	2673560	self-deprecating humour perpetuated negative stereotypes. I think the problem was that many
2673560	2677800	of those who were critical were viewers who could have been won over if the show was managed
2677800	2682360	correctly. In that sense, Lily's response did not invite them to watch further. But what about those
2682360	2687240	who were invited? I've been an on-camera audience member a couple of times for this similar type of
2687240	2691480	show, so that's why I felt I was qualified to review the show in this way. I feel I have a
2691480	2696200	good understanding of what's a normal use of the applause sign, what's a normal use of a warm-up
2696200	2700360	in the beginning, what's a normal amount of production, crew involvement, taping, etc.
2700360	2705000	General things that most shows like this need, and I can honestly say that I was surprised by
2705000	2709160	how overproduced A Little Late with Lily Singh is. A good video on this was published by the
2709160	2713640	YouTuber Swell Entertainment, named I Was A Little Late with Lily Singh Audience Member.
2713640	2717640	Swell details the experience of being in the audience on multiple occasions, delivers some
2717640	2721400	technical criticism of the show, and imparts some anecdotes from her time at the studio.
2721400	2726200	Riko started talking to me before the taping of the second episode. He was not shy about the fact
2726200	2730920	that he knew all the crew, and that he was in fact working for the show. He said he had attended so
2730920	2735000	many tapings that Lily had taken notice, and offered to try and find him a job for the show.
2735000	2739240	He told me that his job varied, but for the most part it boiled down to him being in fact
2739240	2743800	a paid audience member. Lily doesn't seem to have a problem with people knowing that Riko
2743800	2745720	works on the show as an audience member.
2752600	2754360	Aside from when the show is actually being taped,
2765240	2772920	however, the most interesting information comes towards the end of the video, when she mentions
2772920	2777480	the presence of NBC executives, and the tension it caused at the studio, particularly regarding
2777480	2779160	Lily Singh's monologue subjects.
2779160	2783560	Lily's monologue became a Twitter moment because she did a whole monologue talking about being
2783560	2788600	bisexual woman, and how she had come out about a year prior, and how no one should get to dictate
2788600	2792680	how much she talks about being a bi woman of color, and I'm conflicted on this. If it was
2792680	2796440	an earlier episode, I would have applauded you for the statement, because then I would have known
2796440	2801000	that, okay stand your ground, see how it goes over, and then if it doesn't work out, clearly
2801000	2805720	me standing my ground is not keeping people watching, and it's not helping reviews. People
2805720	2809720	don't care that I'm standing my ground. They still don't think the jokes are funny. They don't like
2809720	2813240	the games. They don't like the interviews. They don't want x, y, and z. They think the show should
2813240	2817960	be canceled. I would have known that you would have had time to adjust, and you know grow as a
2817960	2823080	show, and grow as a late night host. However, I know that this was the fourth to last episode
2823080	2828680	that was recorded, and I know that this was one of four episodes that I attended over the span of
2828680	2832920	three months, and I'll tell you something, Lily. I saw zero growth in that time.
2832920	2836840	The impression was that Lily wasn't really interested in adjusting her scope on the basis
2836840	2842360	of the criticism, and on that basis, the show was staring down a rather imminent cancellation.
2842360	2846440	A Little Late with Lily Singh is not your YouTube channel. You're on the top of the food chain at
2846440	2850200	your YouTube channel. For your channel, you have people that work for you. You are in charge of
2850200	2855000	them. Over at Siren Studios where A Little Late with Lily Singh is filmed, sure you are also in
2855000	2859000	charge over there. The thing is though is that that's not your building. It's NBC's building.
2859000	2864040	Your show is not on your YouTube channel. It's on NBC's network, and their slot, and they get to
2864040	2868760	decide whether or not they renew or cancel your show. The fact that they placed you at Siren
2868760	2873960	Studios away from NBC Studios alone should show you that you are erasable. If you're not making
2873960	2877560	them stupid amounts of money, they will just get rid of your show. It doesn't matter what
2877560	2882680	The Atlantic or CNN says about you, because the critics are not the people watching 90%
2882680	2886920	of the time, and your viewership is dwindling, and I don't know what else to say.
2886920	2889400	But enough speculative talk. What actually happened?
2889400	2893960	Lily, I hope NBC gives A Little Late with Lily Singh a second chance. I don't think they will,
2893960	2897640	but if they do, I think you need to look at the possibility of needing to do a rebrand. But it's
2897640	2901560	also pointless for me to say that because you getting a second season will just re-establish
2901560	2905720	in your mind that, oh, what I've been doing is fine, because clearly that's what got me a second
2905720	2909640	season, so I just need to keep doing what I've been doing. Lily, you're not the first person who
2909640	2912840	has tried to do something outside of YouTube, and the reason a lot of them are able to start
2912840	2917480	to try and do that is because they have what can get them in the door. They've got the well-known
2917480	2921080	face, they've got the numbers, but they don't have what it takes to keep them in the room.
2921080	2922600	Show me why you deserve to stay here.
2932520	2936840	As the first season progressed, the ratings were overall reported to be consistent with the final
2936840	2941640	season of Carson Daly, which some may have cited as reason to consider the show an overall triumph.
2941640	2945560	However, considering that this was touted as a show that was breaking down walls and tearing
2945560	2949720	up the late night scene as we know it, considering how much publicity the debut season of this show
2949720	2954280	received in comparison to the final one of Carson Daly, it would be hard not to find such data
2954280	2958600	somewhat disappointing for what it was trying to do. This was a person who could command a channel
2958600	2962840	that would regularly pull in millions of viewers a video, someone who was meant to be going toe to
2962840	2967080	toe with the late night jimmies, and yet in spite of all the controversy, the performance felt
2967080	2971880	surprisingly tame. With all this in mind, it felt like Lily's route in addressing all that transpired
2971880	2975880	had brought attention to the show, but not necessarily the right kind. Although videos
2975880	2980200	criticising her had brought in plenty of views, much of the content didn't drive people towards
2980200	2984440	this new network backed venture, likely leaving some to wonder whether this risky project would
2984440	2989000	be able to maintain such ratings when online coverage died down. Would it even be worth the
2989000	2994280	second season all things considered? Well, going off what I've said so far, I wouldn't blame you
2994280	2997720	for being under the impression that this would have been the end of the late night circuit for
2997720	3002440	Lily Singh. If NBC were hoping that this would be the gambit that paid off, it hadn't really returned
3002440	3006760	many dividends, and all things considered, in spite of the trailblazing narrative, everybody
3006760	3010680	else seemed to think that this trail had been run. Given that episodes on made talk shows were
3010680	3015080	temporarily placed on hold at the start of 2020, people thought it would be a fitting time to put
3015080	3032520	this experiment to bed. On YouTube in particular, the narrative had mostly been established that
3032520	3036760	this was likely the end of Lily Singh as we know it. I think the idea that the show would be
3036760	3040680	cancelled was good clickbait, and played into the predominant outlook on the matter.
3040680	3044760	Throughout the start of 2020, there didn't appear to be much news on the fate of Lily Singh's late
3044760	3049160	night show, and this led to more speculation, but there was probably one more piece of important
3049160	3053880	information that led to hesitancy to decide on its fate. I know it's not the most fun topic to
3053880	3058200	talk about, and I can't blame anyone for switching their ears off now, but it probably is one of the
3058200	3063560	most relevant to today's video. As we know, in 2020, the world was deep in the clutches of the
3063560	3068040	coronavirus, and amidst concern relating to the contagion of the disease, governments in many
3068040	3072280	countries and American states urged people to socially distance and work from home where
3072280	3076840	possible. This included the state of California and Los Angeles County, which enforced austere
3076840	3081240	restrictions on social contact between parties who didn't share the same household. This was bad news
3081240	3085640	for Hollywood, whose output typically required the input of a large workforce, and made filming
3085640	3090120	anything safely practically impossible. This was particularly relevant for talk shows, which not
3090120	3094920	just relied on studio crew, but guest appearances and an audience to provide that necessary
3094920	3098920	atmosphere. There were serious questions looming as to how they would be able to generate this
3098920	3103000	environment without many of the seemingly essential elements that these shows demanded.
3103000	3106920	However, with everyone at home and spending more time than ever in front of their screens,
3106920	3109080	networks weren't ready to be caught slacking.
3109080	3122200	Hi guys, this is Jimmy Fallon, and this is the Tonight Show Home Edition, I guess you can call it.
3122200	3127800	We really don't know what this is, but I wanted to put something out there for you guys so that we
3127800	3136040	can just have some levity in these bizarre times. It didn't take long for a new format to be
3136040	3139560	launched, and for many talk show hosts, this encompassed the presenter hosting from their
3139560	3144040	humble abode. They'd be accompanied by a couple crew members fully masked up, a guest on their
3144040	3148280	television set, and an audience of people attending remotely. There were many people who
3148280	3152680	definitely enjoyed this more laid back ambiance, but it's hard to say that some of these hosts felt
3152680	3158200	completely at home, no pun intended, with the new setting. If only there was someone who could be.
3158200	3162920	COVID also means that we can't have an audience for your tapings. Are you going to be able to
3162920	3166440	handle working without the energy of a live audience? Yeah, that sounds a lot like YouTube,
3166440	3168040	and I don't know if I have enough experience.
3168680	3172760	Due to its recording schedule, the first season of A Little Late ran into the implementation of
3172760	3177240	social distancing. However, when the time came around to consider renewal, much to some people's
3177240	3182520	surprise, NBC decided to do just that. On May 13th, it was announced that A Little Late with
3182520	3186760	Lilly Singh would be returning for a second season at the start of 2021. There were many
3186760	3191240	reasons cited for this, although viewership wasn't quite as high as it could be. The show
3191240	3195560	led all first year shows in the number of social media engagements, with NBC lauding her as an
3195560	3199800	incredible talent who brought an expanding global audience to the network. I think it's a valid
3199800	3203800	point, although a cursory view may tell you that ratings weren't the best. If you're bringing
3203800	3207880	700,000 new viewers to a network, then you're likely doing more than a person who may pull
3207880	3212040	1 million already existing viewers. In this scenario, the social media response aided the
3212040	3215880	show. Even if most potential viewers thought it was bad, the debate that it created online
3215960	3219880	reeled in many individuals who hadn't ever engaged in late night TV as a genre,
3219880	3224280	at least not to the degree that this discourse did. However, the evolving dominion that talk
3224280	3228600	shows could exist in was also probably the main cause for consideration. Household names were
3228600	3232760	being forced to downscale production to maintain it, and whereas some may not have been accustomed
3232760	3236280	to that style, especially those who were used to a lot of support, it was that style that
3236280	3240280	established the careers of many online creators on a certain video showing platform.
3240280	3258120	This was Lilly Singh's moment, and she enthusiastically announced the second
3258120	3261960	season of her show on its official YouTube channel, inspiring excited responses from
3261960	3266280	many of her fans. Would she be up to the challenge, and would any criticism directed
3266280	3270840	towards her previously be heeded? This would all mean very little unless she gave people
3270840	3275400	reason to watch her. She may finally have a home advantage, but she still had many other
3275400	3302040	contemporaries to compete with and wrestle viewership from. Well, in a video posted on
3302040	3305800	her personal blog channel the same day that season two was announced, she promised to do
3305800	3310200	just that, stating that although she was pleased with her work in season one, she knew there was
3310200	3316360	still a lot to be done. The truth is it was my season one of doing something brand new,
3316360	3321400	and season one Lilly reminded me a lot like first YouTube video Lilly, you know, everything takes
3321400	3327000	time, it takes practice, and the reason I communicate this is really just to say I'm proud
3327000	3331320	of season one, but I know there's a lot to improve on, and so when you give me feedback like why
3331320	3335160	doesn't she have this guest on her show? Why isn't she doing this? It's not for lack of trying,
3335160	3345160	it's just I'm trying to figure it out. But words can only say so much. Would it be done?
3355480	3359960	There are so many things I have learned, and I feel like going into season two what I'm really
3359960	3364680	excited about is taking all that knowledge, all the times I've made mistakes and stumbled and
3364680	3369560	was confused, now I know all that stuff, I still have a lot to learn, but I know some stuff now,
3369560	3375000	and I can step into season two just that much better. Much of 2020 was pretty quiet on the
3375000	3378920	announcements front of the TV show at the heart of this humble video, but in December it was
3378920	3382920	reported that the writing crew behind Little Later had been completely overhauled, with Lilly
3382920	3387080	revealing in a statement that she intended to bring more creativity to the table, it seemed
3387080	3392360	that she would have a bit more freedom to pursue her own visions, and on January 11th 2021 the
3392360	3397080	second season of A Little Late with Lilly Singh made its debut, and we would finally answer the
3397080	3408040	question, what has changed? Well, to be honest, a lot.
3417400	3421560	In her video reflecting on season one, Lilly had acknowledged people's desire for more sketch
3421560	3425720	sequences, and the first upload from the new season onto the program's YouTube channel was just
3425720	3429960	that, a sketch in which Lilly plays a variety of characters, including the classic YouTube
3429960	3434840	caricatures of her family and Kamala Harris, whose similarities with Lilly are used as a foundation
3434840	3438840	of a joke that they are actually related. She also uploaded a version of this onto her personal
3438840	3443720	YouTube channel, with it amassing 1.7 million views as of today. This is the sort of sketch
3443720	3447640	where Lilly's nature play multiple characters worked very effectively in a COVID world that
3447640	3451720	aimed to minimise social contact. Although in the first series Lilly had committed to mostly
3451720	3455960	refraining from overtly political topics, the second season brought Lilly her rant room,
3455960	3459720	which would allow her to speak more candidly on subjects that mattered to her. These did include
3459720	3463640	some political subjects, which isn't surprising given that this was around the time of the
3463640	3468120	inauguration of then president-elect Joe Biden, and the resistance that such circumstances
3468120	3472360	precipitated, this being one of the first topics that Lilly addresses in her rant room.
3473800	3478440	We need all the positivity we can get, especially with the recent news of everything that has gone
3478440	3483320	down at the Capitol, and I'm gonna be honest, I have lost all patience for anyone that is still
3483320	3487160	questioning privilege. Additionally, interviews seem far more free-flowing. One of the most
3487160	3491080	common criticisms, even from established media critics, was that Lilly's nature to try and
3491080	3495320	interject her own jokes and punchlines seems to detract from the presence of the guest. In the
3495320	3499400	second season, Lilly still manages to interweave herself into certain questions, but at the same
3499400	3503080	time so that it doesn't take away from her company. It'd also be fair to say that Lilly's
3503080	3506840	second season probably did more work in altering the landscape of talk shows than her first one.
3506840	3511400	Over 20% of her guests on season 2 were making their late night debut, a very significant
3511400	3516120	percentage considering how many shows often tend to stick with certain safe choices for those spots.
3516120	3519720	Lilly often went with guests that she felt she'd be comfortable around, and it seemed to work
3519720	3520840	rather well for her.
3520840	3527960	You have such a level of confidence that I really love, also low-key want, and I feel like your
3527960	3534600	season 2, I'm trying to be the iciest version of myself. How can I be my iciest self for season 2?
3534600	3535560	Give me some pro tips.
3535560	3539880	So like, I see it's like a mentality, it's your hustle, so you know, maybe setting some
3539880	3544600	financial goals. I mean, I already know you a boss, you have your own show, so I can tell you
3544600	3547080	know, you already got your life figured out.
3547080	3549880	Interviews shortly after the first episode of the new season aired,
3549880	3553160	Lilly stated that she wanted to bring a degree of imperfection to the show,
3553160	3557000	and this is also pretty evident. A lot of content that would be typically cut out of
3557080	3561240	a larger scale production was left in, shots of the crew fully masked up, and the backstage
3561240	3564920	equipment may seem unprofessional in certain environments, but here it seemed to fit the
3564920	3569480	casual mise-en-scene rather effectively. Funnily enough, in spite of being restricted to a single
3569480	3573080	residence, Lilly seemed to find much more use for the set than she had in the first season,
3573080	3575560	utilising it for a variety of purposes and skits.
3575560	3580040	Lilly- I just want you to confirm that there is good spirits in here, and if there's bad spirits...
3580040	3581400	Lilly- Let's go throughout the whole house.
3581400	3584280	Lilly- I mostly just don't want them in hair and makeup, it's fine if they're in like the edit bay
3584280	3587160	and stuff like that, I'm just not trying to have them anywhere I am.
3587160	3590600	Now just because something is different doesn't mean that it's necessarily better,
3590600	3594520	and for some online it certainly wasn't. Many people who had criticised Lilly's first season
3594520	3599080	continued into the second, pointing out what they felt were shortcomings in this sort of content.
3599080	3602840	Yes, this is the way we're used to seeing Lilly Singh and other YouTubers portrayed,
3602840	3607720	talking directly in front of a camera or sketches where they play more than one person in the same
3607720	3612840	scene, but it very much feels like an industry plant Lilly Singh instead of actual Lilly Singh,
3612840	3617320	simply because like any other TV show there are many people working on it,
3617320	3622680	and the more of Lilly's late show I watch, the less control I feel like she actually has over it.
3622680	3626280	And it's not like this criticism was without merit, certain aspects of Lilly's show
3626280	3630680	probably could be perceived as unnecessarily convoluted and lacking focus, the jokes were
3630680	3635000	hit and miss, and there were some pretty bad misses. However, the best metric to tell if
3635000	3639560	this sort of content was affected with its target audience was just to read the comments as always,
3639560	3643560	and in this season's case, the response was much more positive, and it's clear that these
3643560	3647720	weren't just fans who would say that regardless, there were many viewers who noted its improvement
3647720	3651800	on the previous season. Now this doesn't mean that negative comments didn't exist elsewhere,
3651800	3655560	or anywhere, but for the most part they provide the impression that these people would never
3655560	3660040	really enjoy Lilly Singh anyway, or late night TV as a whole. It's important to remember that
3660040	3664600	late night shows can be a bit preachy and heavy handed with their humour and messaging,
3664600	3669160	trying to keep an audience entertained and pushing the envelope while not being crass
3669160	3673800	is a somewhat delicate art and you will fall short at points. Lilly Singh having some of that
3673800	3678120	wasn't a deal breaker for most people, and let's face it, she didn't necessarily build her career
3678120	3682360	on subtlety. As a TV show working within the perimeter of a long established industry,
3682360	3686680	there would always be some contrivances, but I think this was as close as many were going to get
3686680	3691400	to Lilly Singh actually being herself in the late night format, and for regular viewers of her,
3691400	3695160	that was a resounding victory. This appeared to be a resounding victory for Lilly as well,
3695160	3698760	who spoke about how she felt so much more comfortable in season 2, stating that she had
3698760	3702760	become tired of monitoring herself and her thoughts, and just chose to speak about whatever
3702760	3706200	was on her mind, prioritising that authenticity.
3706200	3710600	Like admittedly in season 1 I thought there were moments where I wasn't completely being myself,
3710600	3715160	maybe I was nervous or I felt a lot of pressure, and so with season 2 I'm really prioritising
3715720	3719320	throwing all facades out the window, I want to be completely authentic, you know me and my
3719320	3724040	producers always have like little mini headbutt sessions because I'll be interviewing a guest
3724040	3727560	and they'll script something that's like, you know I love doing this movie, and I'll be like
3727560	3732200	I've never seen that movie, and I insist on being authentic about it because I don't want to lie,
3732200	3736680	I'd rather make the time to watch all of the things before I interview someone, and if I don't
3736680	3741080	have the time I'd rather be honest and say like, listen, people online are going crazy about you,
3741080	3746360	as opposed to like, I loved you in this movie and I'm such a big fan because I just feel like
3746360	3750760	it doesn't feel like it's real. It seems like the shackles that COVID had placed on society in
3750760	3755240	general had actually unshackled Lilly from a lot of the customs that late night TV was expected
3755320	3759720	to conform to, and for the first time Lilly Singh had room to embrace the environment that had
3759720	3764760	brought her so much prosperity on YouTube. Could this be the future of television talk shows?
3764760	3767960	Could Lilly Singh be the future of late night TV?
3775480	3779480	Sometimes there's very little you can do. Next time I hear anyone hating on Gen Z,
3779480	3781240	I'm just gonna tell them bye bye bye.
3782280	3782600	What?
3782600	3786440	Throughout the start of 2021, Lilly Singh's show appeared to be performing well with those who
3786440	3790280	engaged with it, however unfortunately it's also about the number of people who engaged with the
3790280	3794040	content in the first place, and in a time when numbers should have been boosted from people
3794040	3799480	staying at home and watching TV, Lilly Singh's ratings left a lot to be desired. In the extent
3799480	3803480	of her time on air, her viewership decreased approximately a quarter from her predecessor
3803480	3807800	Carson Daly, with this continuing to trend downwards in the second season. This was also
3807800	3812680	the case with YouTube, where views on videos would regularly fall below 100,000. Additionally,
3812680	3817320	as much as the home setting was pretty unique and well suited to Lilly's style, many shows were
3817320	3820760	beginning to venture back into the studio, and although it wouldn't have been impossible to
3820760	3824360	continue the home setting which appeared to be popular with some viewers, it would've been a
3824360	3829000	gamble as they didn't exactly embody the late night aesthetic that many had become used to.
3829000	3833160	Although it was true that Lilly brought a fair few new viewers to the network, there were still
3833160	3838120	a lot of financial factors that NBC needed to consider, and in lieu of this, just under a month
3838120	3842360	before the second season even concluded, it was announced that a little late with Lilly Singh
3842360	3847640	would not be returning for a third season, to the disappointment of fans and the joy of detractors.
3847640	3851400	With that said, it was also announced that this was not the end of Lilly Singh's career at NBC,
3851400	3855480	and that she would be signing a first look contract with Universal for future unscripted
3855480	3859640	projects, which shows the network definitely saw the potential in much of her second season.
3859640	3863400	It was also announced that she would be involved in the development of a comedy series with
3863400	3869160	Black-ish creator Kenya Barris, not a bad result. Overall, this news was framed by many outlets as
3869160	3873640	a recalibration rather than a cancellation. Lilly herself released a statement to social
3873640	3877080	media on the day of the announcement, stating that although they would be saying goodbye to
3877080	3881000	A Little Late with Lilly Singh, this would allow her to focus more on her production company and
3881000	3884600	her own projects. Additionally, she was very excited to share the aforementioned upcoming
3884600	3889080	enterprises that she would be working on, and to be honest, Lilly has every reason to feel optimistic
3889080	3892680	moving forward. As she had mentioned in an earlier video of hers, regardless of the reception
3892680	3897080	to her show, it had raised her profile notably, and even during its airing, the number of roles
3897080	3901480	she secured increased significantly. This included acquiring further voice acting paths for two
3901480	3905880	animated feature films, an array of TV positions that would eventually lead to her being offered
3905880	3910600	a spot on the judging panel for Canada's Got Talent, and a host role for this year's Academy
3910600	3911720	Awards pre-show.
3936200	3940280	By all intents and purposes, endless doors have been opened due to her position in hosting a
3940280	3944040	late night talk show, regardless of whether it was good or bad, and the future was looking
3944040	3948280	quite exciting for her. Lilly expressed optimism in moving forward with these undertakings,
3948280	3952600	and bringing diversity to the screen in an even bigger way, and she's certainly not wrong. There
3952600	3956360	was little doubt that this was a great leap forward in her career, and work that would be
3956360	3960840	turned down by very few people. As much fun as she probably had with the second season of her show,
3960840	3965480	it was also a very demanding and time-consuming schedule, and this change in pace would probably
3965480	3970200	give her a bit more breathing room to do what she wanted to, and on her own terms as well. With this
3970200	3973640	in mind, on the 23rd of July, Lilly returned to her YouTube channel.
3983560	3987880	Here she spoke about a variety of projects, but also stated that she was excited to be back on
3987880	3992840	YouTube, and making content that she had control over, promising to be more untamed than ever.
4000200	4019560	It seems that her enjoyment of sketches have been reignited once more, and over the coming weeks
4019560	4023480	and months she posted many of these sketches onto her channel. These videos typically involved a
4023480	4027480	large cast and higher production values than her older content, but still attempted to convey that
4027480	4048120	same relatable sketch humour that propelled her to stardom. A couple of these videos picked
4048120	4052040	up on the algorithm, but most performed pretty modestly for a channel of Lilly's size,
4052040	4056600	scoring a similar count to her network ratings. The truth was that comedy on YouTube had headed
4056600	4060360	in a different direction in the last few years, either towards more commentary-driven content,
4060360	4065320	or even shorter, more absurdist sketches like the ones you see on TikTok. The audience was evolving,
4065320	4070200	and many of Lilly's prospective viewers did lie in places other than YouTube. If one thing was clear,
4070200	4074520	it was that NBC quite liked Lilly Singh, and although they weren't willing to continue the
4074520	4079400	talk show, they wanted to retain her abilities for future content, and both parties seemed happy with
4079400	4083480	that outcome. It's not hard to see why many thought a late night show catered towards a more
4083480	4087720	millennial audience should have legs. Unfortunately, it just didn't, and although
4087720	4091400	there'll always be a recurring audience, the numbers have been dwindling for the past few
4091400	4096360	years, and Lilly's slot was already not considered prime time. Since Lilly's departure, other hosts
4096360	4100920	who had broadcast at similar time slots had also left their programs, including Trevor Noah and
4100920	4105400	James Corden. NBC themselves had stated they would not be replenishing the time slot, and subsequently
4105400	4109800	handed it back to affiliates in the following months, making Lilly the last host of a talk show
4109800	4115000	in that time slot held since 1988. From NBC's perspective, it was clear that it wasn't just
4115000	4119320	a Lilly problem, but a systemic one that wouldn't be so easy to resolve. Some presented the
4119320	4123480	cancellation of Lilly Singh's talk show as a mercy killing, and although a network is seldom
4123480	4127800	going to admit when something isn't working, the decision to discontinue programs at that specific
4127800	4131960	time slot after discontinuing Lilly's show probably implies they were struggling with that
4131960	4137320	period as it was, and Lilly Singh's show was much more a Hail Mary to save a struggling medium which
4137320	4142760	less and less people were tuning into, rather than the destroyer of NBC bank balances. It seems
4142760	4147240	evident that really, NBC were trying to ask a greater question. Lilly Singh was a creator with
4147240	4152040	15 million subscribers on YouTube, could you translate that sort of digital success into a
4152040	4157240	media-based viewership for a network TV show? The short answer in that case was, no.
4157240	4162440	Lilly Singh-"It's been an honor to be on your screens for two seasons. Thank you so much for all of your love
4162440	4167720	and support and for betting on this crazy girl. I can't wait to see what we do together next.
4167720	4171160	Until then, it's been fun." What's the long answer though?
4179720	4183320	I think it's very easy to write off a little late with Lilly Singh as something that was doomed to
4183320	4187000	fail from the start, and in a way I think there are a lot of valid arguments that could be made
4187000	4191960	to support that. We've already heard some of them. However, is there an alternative reality
4192040	4196360	where a little late with Lilly Singh was actually an undisputed commercial and critical triumph?
4196360	4200040	I'd say it was more possible than many might assume. First, we need to talk about the
4200040	4204200	circumstances that surrounded the creation of a little late with Lilly Singh. Sure, it wasn't a
4204200	4208360	great time for talk shows, many believed this was in part due to the rise of streaming, and they may
4208360	4212280	have had a point, but many clips from talk shows still performed well on YouTube, and even if they
4212280	4216520	were losing their share of the market in one place, they still held down a reasonable audience in
4216520	4220760	another. Lilly Singh's career was from YouTube, born and raised, and this should have been a
4220760	4225800	stomping ground. Although times were changing, they hadn't changed that quickly. When reading
4225800	4229720	comments about her late night show being launched, I noticed a trend of a lot of people saying they
4229720	4234040	were happy for her, even though they didn't really watch her content anymore. I think that should
4234040	4238600	have been considered when creating the show. Lilly was someone who didn't quite have the draw she
4238600	4243400	once had on YouTube, and late night talk shows faced the same problem on TV, but in a way that's
4243400	4249320	why it should have worked. But sure, people thought they had outgrown Lilly, and they definitely had
4249320	4254440	on YouTube, but a more mature spin on her content is exactly what the late night world should have
4254440	4259000	brought her, it should have been an open goal for that much at least. There are obviously a
4259000	4263160	wide spectrum of opinions on Lilly's technique, and I have to say it's not really my cup of tea
4263160	4267160	personally, but when you've seen enough late night clips, you tend to gather a mental image for what
4267160	4272440	is generally considered acceptable content for the genre, and Lilly's content wasn't exactly outside
4272440	4276280	of that realm. If the second season showed us anything, it's that although there may be some
4276280	4280440	who would never really enjoy Lilly's style, there definitely was a way to make her YouTube sketch
4280440	4285000	content compatible with some of the usual traffics of mainstream television. But, I hear you say,
4285000	4289240	season two was completely different to the first season, and late night television as a whole.
4289240	4293800	Lilly was in an environment much closer to her original YouTube content, and you my friend are
4293800	4297800	not wrong, I'll grant you that much. But season two didn't just work the way it did because it
4297800	4301800	was in a house, it may have littered some pressure off Lilly's shoulders, but she still had to carry
4301800	4306120	the show in a way that she hadn't done before, and for many people she did just that. But how
4306120	4323080	would it have translated into a studio environment? Well, I think she should have just taken more of a
4323080	4327960	homegrown vibe to make it work. Lilly stated that she often felt confined in her sets and suits,
4327960	4331960	and although there are often foundations of many late night talk shows, I don't think a lot of
4331960	4336120	people would have cared if she didn't care for them. It was the same reason a lot of people found
4336120	4340360	the monologue somewhat laboured, it wasn't what was comfortable for her, and although sometimes
4340360	4344120	it's good to learn new skills and abilities, trying to cram it in multiple recordings in
4344120	4348280	the space of a few months wasn't going to aid her development on that front, and many people
4348280	4353000	noted how she did genuinely struggle with those aspects of the show. Drop the suits, drop the
4353000	4356840	monologues, Lilly worked best when she was surrounded by people who she could bounce her
4356840	4360920	energy off. In promoting her show, Lilly made a fair few appearances on other people's shows,
4360920	4364440	and in many comment sections you'd see audience members surprised that actually,
4364440	4367400	she could have a pretty natural and free-flowing conversation.
4367400	4387960	Lilly was a talented speaker in many regards, she often seemed the most comfortable when she
4387960	4391720	was being impromptu, and if that talent was harboured correctly, there was no reason for
4391720	4395800	it not to work in a talk show environment, it really should have been a slam dunk as well.
4395800	4399800	The talk shows are still more than that, and as many observed this was a stale genre
4399800	4403800	that Lilly should have kicked the door in, but a lot of people felt she ultimately didn't manage
4403800	4408840	to. What could she have done differently to ensure that change? Lilly had made the bold decision to
4408840	4413160	not necessarily make current affairs the focal point of her content, and to completely avoid
4413160	4417240	politics as a topic. This was framed as an active production choice, but also would have been
4417240	4421000	imperative due to the recording schedule as there was no way to predict what subject would be
4421000	4425480	trending months after recording. It's a challenging objective to set oneself, and many would argue
4425480	4430040	that it was simply impossible to do, because current affairs is how talk shows make themselves
4430040	4433960	relevant to their audience. Nevertheless, the movement towards YouTube for a lot of these
4433960	4438360	programs did provide the potential for more timeless discourse, as content could be accessed
4438360	4442680	in the months, years and decades after they aired. With that acknowledged, Lilly still needed to
4442680	4446920	ensure that the subject she lined up could sufficiently propel an episode of her show.
4456440	4471560	The topic she chose often related to her identity and experiences, and on the surface they weren't
4471560	4476120	bad subjects to discuss or to channel into one's content, but the traditional monologue style of
4476120	4480520	late night TV often made the delivery of these subjects somewhat forced and stiff. I think the
4480520	4484920	show not tell aspect would have aided her here, people felt most empowered when she was able to
4484920	4489480	express her identity without explicitly stating it, and it clearly held meaning to a lot of people
4489480	4494120	that shouldn't have been overlooked. There was real potential here to change late night TV for
4494120	4499000	the better. So yes, for what it's worth, I do think as a cosy late night show that perhaps didn't ask
4499000	4502840	too much of the viewer, and just featured Lilly shooting the shit with a variety of celebrities
4502840	4506920	and channeling her energy and background in a unique way could have worked pretty effectively,
4506920	4511000	even in a studio environment, and it still could have become that in time if a third season had
4511000	4515400	been greenlighted. The first season was quite the deep end to be thrown into, even as an established
4515400	4519960	figure amongst Hollywood society. Lilly had never anchored a major talk show, let alone held a
4519960	4524440	prominent role in one, she'd done a few interviews and proven herself as a decent conversationalist,
4524440	4528520	but when you introduce so many different features and accrue to a person who is often coasting off
4528520	4532680	their own spontaneous nature, you're seriously complicating the formula. But it's not that I
4532680	4536360	don't think it couldn't have worked in the right environment, it's just that in an attempt to
4536440	4541000	provide Lilly Singh with proverbial stabilisers, the network overlooks what made her such an
4541000	4544920	effective talker and host in the first place. Those are the teething issues of the first season
4544920	4551080	that could have been alleviated over time, and in a way they were, yet it wasn't enough. Why?
4551640	4553400	Well, first impressions are everything.
4561720	4565880	I'm going to say something fairly uncontroversial right now, the first episode of A Little Late
4565880	4567880	with Lilly Singh was not very good.
4575320	4579400	I appreciate that the critics saw something a lot of audiences did, but for an episode that
4579400	4583640	was meant to take late night into a new era, it fundamentally fell short of what it was trying
4583640	4587640	to do. It's funny because the whole episode is about the fact that she's breaking new ground,
4587640	4591960	and yet bar a couple moments it all feels surprisingly interchangeable with the majority
4591960	4596520	of her peers and competitors. Sometimes it's not just about saying, it's about being,
4596520	4600920	and there is little debate that Lilly Singh is a person of Indian Punjabi descent raised in Canada,
4600920	4604520	but if someone put a gun to your head and told you to prove it, you wouldn't just say you are,
4604520	4609160	or perform a rap about it, you'd show your culture and background. For the number of jokes directed
4609160	4613320	at white people's expense, it still almost felt catered to white people who were comfortable
4613320	4617320	laughing at their failure to understand other cultures, but not comfortable in trying to
4617320	4621400	actually understand them. For a show that should have been directed towards a slightly younger
4621400	4625320	audience who are far more engaged in that sort of discourse, particularly with the multicultural
4625320	4630680	aspect of online spaces, it felt like they didn't have a fundamental comprehension or respect for a
4630680	4641960	fair few of their target viewers. And yet, whereas the first episode could have flown under the
4641960	4645880	radar and never been spoken about again, many descended on the show to critique,
4645880	4650440	criticise, and deride Lilly Singh for said failings. And as noted, the YouTube algorithm
4650680	4654440	favoured these clips as they received the most attention, regardless of whether it was positive
4654440	4658840	or negative. Modern YouTube comedians and commentators similarly chimed into the matter
4658840	4662520	that was one of their own trying to fly the coop, yet struggling to spread their wings.
4662520	4668280	But then the second episode aired, and the third, and the fourth, and the fifth, and the rest, yet,
4668280	4673080	in the next couple months people still almost seemed to solely focus on the first few episodes,
4673080	4678280	or just the first episode exclusively. Now Lilly didn't exactly help by making indirect responses
4678360	4681160	to these videos which showed that she hadn't really watched any of them,
4681160	4684920	which then promoted more responses to people annoyed at her response, but what if I was to
4684920	4688120	sit here and tell you that it wasn't just the second season that was fine,
4688120	4690920	but a large majority of the remainder of the first season was fine as well.
4698920	4702440	Maybe not. There are still a fair few issues which we've already spoken about,
4702440	4706040	and I think they were difficult to fully address in the space of a season that was recorded with
4706040	4710680	the intensity of a little late. To be frank, it still gets pretty dire at points.
4710680	4714040	Nonetheless, a large majority of the season wasn't video response worthy,
4714040	4717800	and that's why, simply put, there were very few videos covering those episodes,
4717800	4721720	and it is a fair bit of a shame that this was the case, and that many had passed judgement
4721720	4726920	for October had even come around. It was episode one of season one, you go back and watch early
4726920	4730440	episodes of some of the most prestigious talk shows, and they aren't the best.
4730440	4734760	Hell, some of the greatest TV shows of all time needed a couple seasons to fully find their feet,
4734760	4738600	it's easy for people to give books, films, and the rest a negative review because you can
4738600	4743720	experience it all at once. The episodic nature of a TV series though made that first episode
4743720	4748200	even more important. A little late with Lilly Singh will be remembered by many for as little
4748200	4752360	as a line. Hell, some people were still reacting to those first season monologues
4752360	4755720	over half a year after these episodes were published onto YouTube.
4765320	4769160	Yeah, girl, I don't know about that one.
4769160	4772120	Let me make it clear, Lilly stoked the fire by responding the way she did,
4772120	4775560	because it kept all the focus on these questionable writing decisions. Dismissing
4775560	4779160	what was otherwise legitimate criticism, she probably felt like she was being unfairly
4779160	4783400	scrutinised for cherry picked segments of a show that had already aired hours of content
4783400	4787480	at that point. It's natural to feel defensive, particularly given the amount of effort she
4787480	4791320	felt she had invested into the show, but the best response would have just been to speak
4791400	4795800	to audiences and ask them to give it another chance if she really thought it was worth it.
4795800	4800280	As noted, she alienated her own viewers through her style, and they weren't audiences that could
4800280	4804520	never be won over, it just felt like she didn't care enough to try and do so, or she thought it
4804520	4809080	was an effective marketing tool to win new people over, and to an extent it was I guess,
4809080	4813480	but only as a temporary measure, and not the healthiest measure all things considered.
4814040	4818520	As we know, at the end of the first season, NBC bragged about how A Little Late with Lilly Singh
4818520	4823560	received the most social engagements of any debut TV show, and that was a feat of some sorts,
4823560	4828200	but that was only due to the discourse surrounding her qualities as a late night host in the programme
4828200	4833880	itself. Problem was, as season 2 improved on season 1, there was less desire for that debate. Lilly
4833880	4837800	probably could have accrued more short term views by inviting all her internet critics round and
4837800	4841400	debating them at her house, but instead she actually clearly took some of the feedback
4841400	4845640	on board and transformed her set and style, and yet because the show was now actually
4845640	4850440	good or passable at least, she couldn't rely on that debate to spur short term ratings anymore.
4850440	4853880	The other issue was that there was approximately 8 months between the end of season 1 and the start
4853880	4858440	of season 2, of which the show was barely mentioned to the press. This interval meant that
4858440	4862040	by the time the start of the second season came around, many who had previously been engaged in
4862040	4865960	the debate now were investing their attention elsewhere. When I was speaking to a few friends
4865960	4869560	about this video, I mentioned that A Little Late with Lilly Singh was actually renewed for a second
4869560	4874440	season, which provoked surprise from many who assumed it ended with season 1. Humans are
4874440	4879160	interesting creatures, for a lot of online trends and subjects, we're only really interested in
4879160	4883880	providing it with attention to a certain threshold, and then unless there is some revelation relating
4883880	4888200	to the topic, we are unlikely to revisit the matter. Lilly Singh's show could have very
4888200	4893160	easily had a rocky start, but built up its credo over time, and by the time that it caught the
4893160	4898440	attention of those who may not be within her core fanbase, had a pretty solid reputation.
4898440	4902600	Unfortunately, content spreads quickly online, and it was first impressions that defined the
4902600	4906200	future of the show. You could make the argument that Lilly's show would never have improved if
4906200	4911160	she hadn't received as much criticism, which is a fair point and possibly true, but the criticism
4911160	4915560	became bigger than the show itself. People reached their limit for discourse regarding Lilly Singh's
4915560	4919800	late show on the basis of the first few episodes and the subsequent reactions to them, but weren't
4919800	4924680	ready to give it another try by the time the second season came around. First impressions
4924680	4930040	really were everything. The first episode of A Little Late with Lilly Singh was not very good,
4930040	4934200	but I don't think it was a complete representation of what became of the show. Unfortunately,
4934200	4939080	the nature of the internet allowed judgement to be passed before she even had the chance to improve,
4939080	4943240	and probably doomed the show before season 2 had even been conceptualised,
4943240	4946600	and for that it was a shame. Let's wrap this up now.
4953000	4957480	There's an episode of Spongebob Squarepants in season 4 called Mrs Puff You're Fired,
4957480	4962600	in which Mrs Puff is dismissed due to Spongebob's continuous failure of driving tests. Mrs Puff is
4962600	4966760	replaced by a drill sergeant who surprisingly manages to teach Spongebob how to drive,
4966760	4971240	but with one small caveat, that our Squarepanted friend has learned to do it blindfolded.
4971240	4975560	When the test comes around once more, our special little Sponge is told that it's illegal to drive
4975560	4980280	while blindfolded, and thus the test deteriorates very quickly, causing destruction throughout the
4980280	4985080	entirety of Bikini Bottom until he's blinded once more by Patrick's slacks and suddenly becomes a
4985080	4989400	competent driver again, completing the test. Unfortunately, due to the destruction that has
4989400	4994920	been wrought, he is given a fail again, and Mrs Puff returns, much to her dismay. It's a fun little
4994920	4998840	anecdote, but there is a lot of truth to it. Sometimes you become so accustomed to doing
4998840	5003240	something a particular way that a change designed to help you may have the opposite effect.
5006040	5009240	And you see, this is where the party starts.
5009240	5013400	Lilly Singh procured a claim on YouTube, a platform designed to allow people to create
5013400	5018040	content without the large budget and production value. In many ways, Lilly proved her talent as
5018040	5022520	a creator who could use her experience to attract millions of recurring viewers. On the flipside,
5022520	5027400	Late Night TV, in spite of their extravagant ambience, had also garnered a strong online
5027400	5032040	following, with many hosted networks collaborating directly with YouTube to make sure their reach was
5032040	5036440	optimized on a website that attracted a significantly different audience. Lilly and Late
5036440	5040920	Night originated from very different parts of the creative world, but they ran parallel to each
5040920	5045320	other, and bridging that gap seemed like the natural progression for both parties, and both
5045320	5050200	platforms. Yet it really was the epitome of a misfire by all accounts, that will probably cause
5050200	5054680	a network to think twice before working with the creator again. It prompts the question we ask at
5054680	5060360	the start again, are YouTubers really suited to a world outside YouTube? Well, if the two seasons of
5060360	5064760	A Little Late demonstrate anything, it's that I don't think the potential wasn't there, it's just
5064760	5070120	Hollywood is struggling to understand YouTubers. NBC had said they intended to turn the time slot
5070120	5074440	into more of a creative playground primed for the digital era, but I don't think anyone was
5074440	5079000	committed enough to question what that really meant. From their perspective, it seemed to imply
5079000	5083240	an integration of sly winks to YouTube, but without the proper understanding of why they
5083240	5087640	worked on the platform in the first place. Lilly Singh's Late Night show often tried to foster
5087640	5092200	direct fan support, rather than necessarily marketing it as a separate entity from the mind
5092200	5097000	of Lilly Singh. It's a strange decision because as noted, by that point she partly left YouTube
5097000	5102280	behind. This is a problem with a lot of YouTuber based media outside of YouTube, it aids viewers
5102280	5107000	who have very little familiarity with your content as a whole, yet often doesn't reach as much of
5107000	5111560	your fanbase who are primarily based on YouTube. Lilly Singh's YouTube content reached all four
5111560	5115880	corners of the globe, something that very few Late Night shows can successfully do. Whenever
5115880	5119720	YouTubers do this, it feels like studios are more interested in cashing in off their already
5119720	5123400	established social media presence, rather than actually considering what made them popular in
5123400	5127240	the first place. Comedy on YouTube had largely moved on from Lilly's style, and although the
5127240	5131320	show had potential, it had to mature with the viewers. There was definitely an attempt to do so,
5131320	5134840	but it more or less consisted of putting Lilly in a colourful suit and making her do stand-up
5134840	5139880	in front of a live TV audience instead of actually playing into her well-documented strengths. She
5139880	5144440	was not a stand-up comedian, nor did she wear suits really, she thrived on the spontaneous,
5144440	5148680	the mess, the chaos, and watching her try to perform within the confines of that first season
5148680	5152600	of Late Night sometimes felt like watching a person trying to break out of a straitjacket.
5152600	5156680	Lilly had all these resources at her feet, and many probably thought it should have bolstered
5156680	5160840	her comedy, but it's not how she learned, nor what she was accustomed to. Just because something
5160840	5165480	should make it easier, doesn't mean it will make it easier. Sometimes people are used to the lack
5165480	5170200	of direction because they feel they know themselves best. Combine that with an absolutely brutal
5170200	5174680	recording schedule, and some ill-timed responses from Lilly herself, and for many the first season
5174680	5180040	was dead on arrival, and not worth resuscitating. But then season two happened.
5180440	5183240	Sometimes you gotta do things to fulfil your vision, and just like make it happen,
5183240	5187480	that's what today is. Today is just living our dream. We're just living, we're just,
5187480	5192040	Chris, we're just living our dream today. Not if you're with me. Now not the camera.
5194200	5198600	And even if not everyone enjoyed it, it gave Lilly the breathing room to prove her ability
5198600	5202520	in a space where many had already written her off. What would have made recording far more
5202520	5206600	challenging for a variety of established talk show hosts took Lilly back to where she was most
5206600	5210280	comfortable, and her second season seemed to operate far more smoothly than the first,
5210280	5214440	with guests, viewers, and Lilly herself all appearing to have much more fun than the season
5214440	5218760	that had come before. Alas, it had come a little too late for Lilly Singh. The damage had already
5218760	5222200	been done when the first season hit the screens, and many prospective viewers had switched over
5222200	5225880	the channel, with others receiving their impressions from content creators which directed
5225880	5230440	online opinion. Nonetheless, if the result of the second season is just a piece of media that she
5230440	5234680	and her audience can watch back and enjoy, then maybe it's done the trick. I don't think Lilly
5234680	5239160	laments it too much, and overall it has brought her far more opportunities than it has cost her,
5239160	5243240	and if that's the result of any piece of media then you can consider it a victory.
5243240	5246200	With that said, it's obviously a shame that the show couldn't be something more,
5246200	5250120	couldn't be the trailblazing shot in the arm that late night TV desperately needed.
5250120	5254120	Ratings are still struggling, and it's not like there isn't a reality where I don't see shows
5254120	5258280	that could resemble Lilly's accruing and large viewership. I do think YouTube and Late Night
5258280	5262680	could have a close relationship, I think there's more opportunity in using a creator's personality
5262680	5266520	and appeal in these spaces than there are in film and TV, but you have to understand that a lot of
5266520	5271000	people don't just tune in for a name, you need to work with that personality and identity as well.
5271000	5275400	Perhaps a little late with Lilly Singh's second season, even if it didn't return the numbers to
5275400	5281320	maintain its own survival, could provide a few ideas for agonising TV executives all over Hollywood.
5281320	5289000	Lilly Singh- I'm a big believer that if you have blessings, you don't build a higher fence, you build a longer table.
5289000	5295400	I quite like Lilly Singh, not in the haha I think she's hilarious way, or even the yas queen slayer way.
5295400	5299320	I don't think she always knew how to respond to people discussing her show, and I think she interpreted
5299320	5304040	a lot of the criticism as bad faith, when really they probably had a point. I think she was part of
5304040	5309000	the why can't everyone just get a long generation, and a lot of newer creators on YouTube just didn't
5309000	5313480	subscribe to that, which is why I think they clashed heads. I don't find her particularly funny, but
5313480	5318120	then again I never really watched her content, and to be honest, neither did a lot of the people that
5318120	5322600	roasted her. However, I don't think it's hard to see why people like her around, and enjoy her presence.
5322600	5326040	She always seems to convey herself as someone who knows how to communicate with the world, and
5326040	5331000	develop a strong, unique chemistry with those that were subject to her attention. Unlike other certain
5331000	5336200	hosts, you didn't need to manufacture a warm aesthetic, because Lilly was a naturally warm person,
5336200	5340440	and you sometimes wonder if the studio has actually ever dealt with someone like that, who didn't need
5340440	5344920	the prompts to have conversations. She didn't need to be told what to be interested about, because she
5344920	5349480	was legitimately interested in things other than herself. She didn't need to be put inside the late
5349480	5352360	night mould, she was there to break it.
5375640	5381160	Alas, maybe a little late with Lilly seeing it wasn't meant to be, and it was cursed from the start.
5381160	5385880	Maybe there was a right way to do it, but it just didn't happen, with networks suddenly failing to
5385880	5390760	promote its longevity. It's hard for anyone to say if there was a way to turn it into the sensation
5390760	5396040	it was imagined by some to be, but for a talk show, it did provide everyone with something to talk about,
5396040	5403160	laugh about, satire, praise, criticise, debate, respond to, engage, and for some, to watch, support,
5403160	5407400	find comfort in, perhaps find themselves a bit closer to a creator they looked up to.
5407400	5413160	Even if it didn't turn the late night TV world upside down, and usher in a new era of YouTuber
5413160	5418680	led shows, it still gave something to YouTube, and maybe that's all it needed to do.
5420920	5422680	Thank you, and goodnight.
5425080	5430200	So yeah, that was the video, I hope you all enjoyed it, I hope you all got something from it,
5430200	5435080	and hopefully it inspires some productive discussion. I want to thank the editors,
5435080	5439960	they've once again done a fantastic job, as always their credits will be in the pinned comments.
5439960	5445160	I want to thank the post editors, Grumpy and Vic Grimes, fantastic work as always,
5445160	5449880	they really came through after the original post editor had to drop out due to a very very sad
5449880	5456200	situation, and sending my love to him as well, you know who you are. Thanks again for the background
5456200	5461320	music as well, I assume that'll be Linuski, I'm not sure yet, but he always does a great job.
5461320	5466920	Thumbnail as always, Starfo, fantastic work. I'd like to thank my Patrons, $10 patrons on the
5466920	5472520	screen now, but I got some $50 patrons to thank as well, thank you again so much guys, Seri, Tish,
5472520	5478040	Esther Bedoya, Hypercube, and Laura Woodward. I really appreciate the support and the belief it
5478040	5483400	clearly represents, so thank you for that. Artists, if your artwork appears in this video,
5483400	5486920	the credits should be in the pinned comment, but if it's not, just let me know and I'll add it.
5486920	5492360	I also need to thank the sponsor, Scentbird, as you can tell, it's very hard for me to contain
5492360	5497800	my enthusiasm. I don't really have much else to add, but I once again hope you enjoyed the video,
5497800	5500680	and if you're still here, thank you for listening to me ramble.
5500680	5503960	I'm The Right Opinion, and I will see you in the next one.
