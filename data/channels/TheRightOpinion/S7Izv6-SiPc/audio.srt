00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,500
Hello, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with

2
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:17,400
too much free time, and YouTubers, although there are certainly a lot of them to choose

3
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,840
from, many would at least say the largest greats on the platform are comparable to the

4
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:34,320
everyday Hollywood celebrity. This seems increasingly accurate as the platform continues to manifest

5
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,900
and evolve larger and larger channels, headed by figures who have become identifiable to

6
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:42,000
even those without a passing interest in the video hosting website. YouTube isn't like

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,700
the mainstream media though, many figureheads are not handpicked, and many have much more

8
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:49,820
centralised control of their content and their vision than certain personages who may be

9
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:54,140
subject to studios and investors. For many, this is what makes YouTube such a good platform

10
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:58,500
to launch one's career, as success is almost exclusively decided by the audience who watch

11
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:02,660
it. However, on the other hand, YouTube is still a very small tranche of media as a whole,

12
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:06,340
and many who achieve the treasured status of mega influencer often begin to look beyond

13
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:10,140
the realms of the platform to further their career. In many ways, this should be a recipe

14
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:13,740
for success, the personal relationship that many creators produce with their channel often

15
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:18,020
gives them a fanbase much more dedicated than that of the average celeb utens. They've

16
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:21,820
already crafted a multi-million subscriber channel from a very limited set of resources,

17
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:24,900
imagine what they could do with the sort of financial backing that many of these large

18
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:28,980
corporations can provide. Think of all the wondrous creations that could be brought into

19
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:37,200
being. It's strange really, because in spite of the numerous attempts to bring popular

20
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,660
YouTubers into the mainstream sphere, a proportionally low number have actually succeeded. There

21
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:45,840
are a few large musicians and comedians who had their start on the video sharing platform,

22
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,440
which makes sense in a way as there are also occupations which can command an exceptionally

23
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:53,200
dedicated fanbase, but besides this, many creators trying to spread their wings have

24
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,520
often been met with limited prosperity outside of their comfort zone. Why is this often the

25
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,520
case?

26
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:01,680
Well, to be honest, I don't think it's really a problem with the YouTuber themselves.

27
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,140
As a matter of fact, many mainstream celebrities of the younger generations have been revealed

28
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:08,240
to have possessed YouTube channels at some point, even if they weren't particularly

29
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:11,680
lucrative in their time. It tells me that the same sort of star power that can drive

30
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,400
a mainstream celebrity can also drive many large YouTubers. I think the main problem

31
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,920
is rooted in the fact that many ventures by popular creators into mainstream media

32
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:22,800
seek to capitalise on their YouTube success without being sensitive to the format that

33
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,480
it's being adapted to. Although they may not seem particularly different on the surface,

34
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,720
a good comedy on YouTube works for very different reasons than a good comedy film works, and

35
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,840
the sort of five second humour that lands here may well fall flat elsewhere. A lot of

36
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,280
YouTube comedy thrives on spontaneity and randomness. If you want to translate that

37
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:42,480
into the world of established media, you still need infrastructure that supports it. Additionally,

38
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:47,080
the contrimences of a lot of entertainment content tend to subdue the appeal of the individual

39
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:50,720
creator, whose personality is often placed at the forefront of their online work, but

40
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,620
may otherwise fall into the background amongst elevated production values. It's not that

41
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:57,800
creators can't work in the mainstream world, it's just that the mainstream world often

42
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,520
doesn't know what to do with them, and the medium often isn't supportive of it. But

43
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:21,560
here's the answer to this quandary right in front of us the whole time. Lay Night

44
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:25,600
Talk shows one of the leading forms of media, particularly in the United States of America,

45
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:29,400
where figures like Jimmy Kimmel, David Letterman, and Conan O'Brien have been immortalised

46
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,680
by their eponymous programs. In the past few years, it has also found significant popularity

47
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,320
on YouTube, with clips from the broadcast garnering billions of views between them,

48
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:41,160
its standalone segments allowing for easy rendering to a site built on that sort of

49
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:44,320
content. Although the subjects are likely planned, prepared, and researched, there is

50
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:48,440
an impromptu element that allows the host to rip, which shows integrating sketches,

51
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:52,480
interviews, and audience interactions, all of which coast off the charisma of the presenter.

52
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,700
Its success on YouTube had already been proven, but what happens if we reverse the formula,

53
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:11,540
and put a YouTuber in a talk show? This is where we introduce today's title character,

54
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:15,060
a YouTuber by the name of Lilly Singh. Lilly Singh was one of the most prominent YouTube

55
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:19,260
cultivated comedians of the 2010s, a sketchy often garnished with commentary, but became

56
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:23,160
adored by many viewers for its ability to portray everyday experiences in an accurate

57
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,960
yet amusing fashion. She would regularly depict fictionalised figures, including her

58
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,240
overbearing conservative parents, and integrate her experiences as the second generation daughter

59
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:36,120
of migrants to Canada, contrasting their traditional values with her exposure to western culture.

60
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,360
This resonated with many around the world, and in the space of a few years, racked up

61
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,240
her channel over 10 million subscribers, becoming one of the most subscribed to channels in

62
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:47,520
the process. With such fame, further opportunities followed, with many of those expected for

63
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,100
some one of her influence. However, probably the most notable and well documented of those

64
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:55,380
was her role in the pioneering show A Little Late with Lilly Singh, which planned to take

65
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:59,560
her brand of YouTube comedy to a whole new level. With proven results, and a format that

66
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:03,900
should nurture her talents, it seemed like a match made in heaven. However, it felt like

67
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,900
as soon as it started, it was over.

68
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:10,500
Lilly Singh-"I believe in this show, because NBC believes in this show, but most importantly

69
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,220
because you believed in this show."

70
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:17,060
In spite of the promising premise, the show was nearly immediately marred in criticism,

71
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:21,160
controversy, and COVID, and after just two seasons, it was dropped from the ever-rotating

72
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:25,780
roster of late night shows, ending another YouTuber experiment with somewhat disappointing

73
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:30,500
results and leaving the question of the compatibility of YouTube's success hanging in the balance.

74
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:34,980
During the show's runtime, many creators and critics alike attempted to point out exactly

75
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:39,040
what didn't work about this show, but now with its fate sealed, I think we should revisit

76
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:43,260
it and ask that question one more time, to see if we can work out exactly what went wrong,

77
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:47,260
and to do that, I suggest we start with the person who made it all happen in the first place,

78
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:52,260
Lilly Singh. So folks, without further ado, let's jump right into it.

79
00:05:52,260 --> 00:06:01,540
Wow guys, it's summer already. Gee, it's come around fast. Well, call me Nelly because it's hot in here.

80
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:08,980
All this sun is making me reconsider my life choices, such as my daily routine. Maybe you should reconsider your life too.

81
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:12,980
And think about ways to spruce it up. Have you noticed that you smell?

82
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:20,140
You know what also smells? Well, now introducing Scentbird, my new favourite brand of all time,

83
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:26,340
at least since my last video. When I go shopping looking for all my Gucci and Prada, my gold

84
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:31,980
chains, cashmere sweaters, and my grey Poupon, I'm always on the lookout for the finest

85
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:40,080
colognes, and I'm not talking about cities in North Rhine Westphalia, however, all these

86
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:45,380
bottles are so large. And what to confine you to one long-term relationship? What if

87
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:50,360
you want to sleep around? Well, Scentbird has you covered. They allow you to try up

88
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:59,360
to three travel-side designer or niche fragrances for just $17 a month. $17! That's like 0.00056

89
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:06,920
Bitcoin, or for all you normies out there, 0.0088 Ethereum. Scentbird has all the designer

90
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:12,520
brands alongside cool other niche perfumes like Salt Air by Skyler, which really captures

91
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:25,920
the airiness and saltiness of an atmosphere with a degree of salinity. The Amberwood Tinge

92
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:30,120
Sign You're After You by Mercedes Benz, which captures the flavours of a man who always

93
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:35,380
lives life in the fast lane, and always keeps 12 points on his license. And the subtle spice

94
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:41,540
of number one, David's Perfume by David Debrick, for whenever you feel like a number one. I'm

95
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:46,840
sorry ladies, please control yourselves. Don't mind me friends, I just put some David Debrick

96
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:52,680
on me, and now everyone's getting excited. Huh, wait, where do they go? Anyhow, I know

97
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:58,180
I said $17 a month earlier, but I'm going to make you a deal. My friend Mr. Scentbird

98
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:02,260
has been talking to me, and he said that for the first month, he's going to give you all

99
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:11,500
55% off. Can you hear him too? Well, all you have to do is use my coupon code RightOpinion

101
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:22,840
US and Canada. Because folks, if it don't make dollars, it don't make sense. Scentbird.

102
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,840
They smell good.

103
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:58,080
Lilly Singh created her channel towards the end of 2010, with the first presently viewable upload being a

104
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:03,080
tutorial on how to tie a turban. Now it's not the first ever upload on her channel, we'll address that in a bit,

105
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:07,080
but I think it's understandable why she has left this up as the first upload. Although obviously very different

106
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:11,560
to the content she would subsequently garner fame from making, it represents a degree of cultural pride,

107
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:16,240
and integrates Lilly's more outgoing personality into the content, with a description that sets up Lilly's

108
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,520
purpose in the creation of this video, observing that there aren't a lot of tutorials that can deliver

109
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:25,560
information in a helpful way, and so she decided to fill that gap. When Lilly first launched her channel,

110
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:30,480
she tried a few avenues of content. There was music, including piano covers and rap remixes,

111
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:35,200
there was some serious commentary, and there were vlogs. Now, none of these performed particularly badly,

112
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,840
as a matter of fact, viewership was pretty consistent throughout the channel in its early stages.

113
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:44,320
However, the best performing video was a comedy one Lilly had made titled Stop Punjabi Madness, and not too long after,

114
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:49,080
she decided to take another shot at the funniest stuff, uploading a video named Official Guide to Brown Girls.

115
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:53,920
Today I'm going to tell you, welcome to Suboma's official guide of how to deal with brown girls.

116
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,480
So hold on tight, because you know it's going to be quite the emotional rollercoaster.

117
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,320
What's cooking good looking?

118
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:05,840
Obviously, much of its production value was very apt for that of 2010, but as personality, and even if some of the humor

119
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:10,360
is very much of its time, it's rooted in that trademark relatability that she'd soon become known for.

120
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:14,880
Additionally, even if a punchline or an edit didn't always land, there was no lack of comedic ambition,

121
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:19,480
and it demonstrated that Lilly was prepared to throw the kitchen sink at the wall just to see what stuck,

122
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:24,760
which can be a real asset to honing in your craft. After its publication, Official Guide to Brown Girls quickly

123
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:29,840
garnered significantly more views than any other video on her channel at that time, possibly giving Lilly a hint to what

124
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:36,640
the masses wanted, and so she obliged, uploading more sketch-based comedy to her channel in the coming months, and years.

125
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:49,840
I swear to God, you have one job, and that's to be sucky. You can't even suck. You make the worst slut ever.

126
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:54,640
Now in Lilly, there was no overnight success, particularly in the world of sketch comedy, which was already saturated by the

127
00:10:54,640 --> 00:11:00,040
early 2010s. Plenty of channels dominated the airwaves, and it was hard for any creator to put their foot in the door.

128
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:05,120
But growth was steady, and enough of those who found her channel decided to subscribe and stick around for her content.

129
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:10,480
Playing the waiting game isn't necessarily a bad option in this case, as it gave Lilly time to improve her skills and creative

130
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:15,680
direction, improving viewer retention and subscriber conversion. This eventually began to pay dividends, particularly

131
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:20,680
around the year 2013, where her content began to be treated very favourably by the YouTube algorithm.

132
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:26,920
Starting the year on approximately 170,000 subscribers, she finished on 1.86 million, the sort of growth that many creators

133
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:31,880
can only dream of. By then, Lilly was producing highly polished videos that captured the energy of her humour,

134
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:37,320
or remaining sincere to the subject matter. She had fleshed out characters, running gags and social commentary from a defined

135
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:43,120
persona that commanded a large fanbase of dedicated viewers. Maybe we'll ask exactly how she did it, well we already spoke

136
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:48,360
about her appeal as a second generation daughter of migrants, but I think it went a little deeper than that. In the early 21st century,

137
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:52,840
the age of the internet was dawning in many countries, which were certainly not used to having such contraption at their

138
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:58,160
disposal. The internet gave young people in their formative years a lot of accessibility to ideas and media that they

139
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:03,040
would never have had the chance to appreciate without the world wide web. However, a lot of this media came into very

140
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:08,560
significant conflict with values held by older generations, those whose perspectives had been formed and cemented a long

141
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:14,040
time ago, and who probably did not interact with that sort of media well. The conflict was the source of tension in a lot of

142
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:19,920
families, and was very much documented for its time. In Lilly's case, her exposure to western culture was part of growing up in

143
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:24,960
Canada, but all over the world, with the increasing access to the online world and social media, people were having the exact

144
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:31,040
same experiences, ones that were encompassed by Lilly's content. In a 2012 interview, when asked about reasons for starting

145
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:36,240
her channel, Lilly replied, one inspiration was definitely the fact that there was no female doing it, particularly an Indian

146
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:41,680
female doing it. Lilly was right in way, although it's obviously an exaggeration to an extent. There were female comedians

147
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:47,640
who uploaded to YouTube, and some who had accrued considerable success doing so, such as Jenna Marbles. Nonetheless, the lion's share

148
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:53,240
of the market was controlled by male led channels. It's nothing against those channels, but there's only so many people you can

149
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:59,240
appeal to from that angle that many of those creators were making videos from. If Ian and Anthony from Smosh began to upload

150
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:04,680
content and wanted to be a brown girl, I think viewers would be understandably confused, but for a long time, people would

151
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:11,120
interpret that lack of representation as a lack of demand in a certain market. Yet by the end of 2014, Lilly's channel,

152
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:18,040
iiSuperwomanii, possessed just shy of 5 million subscribers, over 80% of whom were female, with many likely from a diverse

153
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:23,440
range of ethnic backgrounds. Those sorts of statistics spoke volumes. Nevertheless, Lilly's successes were also being

154
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:29,000
recognised outside of her subscriber count. 2014 brought her nominations for both the Shorty and Streamy Awards,

155
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,040
collaborations with renowned celebrities, a multitude of interviews where she detailed her background and rise to stardom,

156
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:40,000
and regular guest spots at popular conventions. Coming off the year, Singh appeared in the 2014 rewind amongst many of the

157
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,920
platform's then largest creators, cementing her status as YouTube royalty. It was clear that on her current trajectory, she was

158
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:51,560
destined to be one of the website's leading lights. However, some of Lilly's ambition was never going to be merely settled on

159
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:57,680
what she had, and heading into 2015, it was clear she had greater plans. In her time as a content creator, she had appeared in a few

160
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:03,240
films and music videos, particularly those in Indian media, which although not major, definitely reflected her desire to expand

161
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:08,640
into the mainstream industry as a whole. As early uploads on her channel showed, she had always had the hunger for all types of

162
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:14,560
creative content, and now she was about to fully realise it. Lilly Singh was about to go global.

163
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:25,920
In the space of a few years, Lilly Singh had built a YouTube empire, but it's clear that she wanted more, and who could blame her?

164
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:34,160
Lilly Singh- I'm gonna take you all on a trip to Unicorn Island with my first ever world tour!

165
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:39,520
The thing about YouTube is that success is fleeting for most creators, there are exceptions, and likely people who will remain on

166
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:44,920
YouTube for a rather long time to come, people who enjoy their work here. But for many who want more from the entertainment

167
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:51,000
world, YouTube is just the start. This was definitely the case for Lilly Singh. In March 2015, she embarked on a world tour

168
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:56,440
called A Trip to Unicorn Island, which integrated her various talents and interests into one comprehensive performance.

169
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:02,080
Now tours are certainly not out of the ordinary for a creator of her size, however, she also decided to chronicle this circuit with a

170
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:07,360
documentary feature film which shared its name with the tour itself. It was released the following year to mix reviews from

171
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:13,040
critics and audiences, but was likely well received by her devotees as a raw glimpse into the person behind the entertainer,

172
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:18,760
including covering the struggles of content creation. Throughout the year, she began to win awards and receive more coverage

173
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:24,480
from various mainstream media outlets. She won a Streamy and an MTV Fandom Award, and made the top 10 on Forbes' highest

174
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:29,960
earning YouTube stars of that year. This was the perfect time to eye up Hollywood, which was exactly what she was doing.

175
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:37,160
In a 2015 LA Times interview, Singh stated that she intended to move to La La Land by November. She doesn't state why, but I think we

176
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:42,280
can make a reasonable assumption it wasn't for the affordable housing. Come the new year, it's what she had done, and not too

177
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:46,280
soon after, she began to increasingly appear across the entertainment industry as a whole.

178
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:11,720
With Lea's success, it wasn't hard to understand why she was so sought after. She commanded a large fanbase who would readily

179
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:16,920
watch whatever she was credited just to point her out, she had a proven record of being able to hold her own as a performer,

180
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:22,360
and she was some of the hottest product on the scene at the time. However, Hollywood was a very different can of worms to YouTube,

181
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:27,400
and whereas Lily was one of the largest influencers at the time on the video sharing platform, she was still a relatively small

182
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:33,080
fish in Hollywood. Many creatives had pioneered the industry before her, and her experience, although no less inherently

183
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:37,840
meaningful, was set against an industry full of people who had already broken the ground that she walked on.

184
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:44,400
YouTube had been around for just over a decade, Hollywood had existed for over a century. With this in mind, although you'd

185
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:49,680
certainly be impressed to read a repertoire of her media appearances, she never made any performances that felt particularly

186
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:55,760
memorable. Her roles weren't derisory by any means, but they didn't represent that guarantee of longevity that so many budding

187
00:16:55,760 --> 00:17:01,840
stars aspired for. One of the most promising prospects was an NBC show by the name of Bright Futures, which was set to have

188
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:08,080
and another YouTube breakout star, Jimmy Tatro, playing young friends all attempting to realise their careers. Unfortunately, this

189
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:12,480
was scrapped not too long after it was conceived, serving a rather bitter blow to those involved.

190
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:18,480
We'd seen it before, a YouTuber goes to Hollywood, manages a few minor speaking roles in studio productions, and then mostly

191
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:23,520
fades away when the novelty of their presence wears off, and after the first few acting roles, there probably were those who

192
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:28,040
wondered if Lily Singh would be assigned to the same category, but there were signs this wasn't the case.

193
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,520
I love who I am, and that's when I decide I'm a boss.

194
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,520
Yeah, see?

195
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:39,240
In March 2017, she published her first autobiography, How To Be A Boss, A Guide To Conquering Life.

196
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:45,480
Going off the synopsis, it looks like a crash course in fulfilling Maslow's pyramids of needs. However, that's not necessarily a bad

197
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:50,600
thing, and a lot of people seem to agree, boring itself to the number one spot on the New York Times bestseller list.

198
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:55,720
She hosted a successful world tour to promote the book, all while continuing to work on her projects for her YouTube channel and

199
00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:00,600
Although she hadn't quite defined her career yet, it felt like she was on the right trajectory.

200
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:05,000
I'd say the most important aspect of her status in Hollywood was that of a public figure in general.

201
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:10,600
As her old content had layered more social commentary than a lot of her contemporaries, she carried more social clout than a lot of

202
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:16,360
other YouTube figures who had tried to change lanes. Her history of being outspoken regarding many causes, including mental

203
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:21,560
health, the treatment of women, and the representation of marginalized groups in media, had garnered her the reputation that

204
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:27,160
she could be a good ambassador for many noble causes. It meant people often wanted to listen to what she had to say, and her

205
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:33,960
success only emboldened this observation. In 2017, she became a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador, a role occupied by celebrities

206
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:40,120
such as David Beckham, Katy Perry, and Jackie Chan. Singh's role specialized in advocating for children's rights, and she

207
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,120
addressed the United Nations the following year.

208
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:50,360
Now getting to where I am today and achieving this level of success was not easy, but when I compare myself to the circumstances

209
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:57,560
of what the majority of young people face, to be honest, I feel like I practically won the lottery. I got to receive an

210
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:05,080
education, I got support, I didn't have to face obstacles such as poverty, conflict, or failed institutions.

211
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:10,760
She also used this authority to represent the online world and their often divisive sense of humor, tickling countries that

212
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:16,360
weren't necessarily the most free speech oriented. It was clear that Lily meant business. She began to acquire a fair few roles

213
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:22,760
that didn't necessarily rely on comedy, but more on her own natural self and background. She collaborated with Smashbox Cosmetics,

214
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:28,760
Calvin Klein, Ardennes, and Pantene just to name a few, and appeared alongside many other famous females in Maroon 5's song

215
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:34,840
Girls Like You. With creators from the world of YouTube, there was a sense that many just wouldn't translate into being engaging

216
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:41,320
celebrities, and sometimes that was the case, but Lily was a departure from that. Her roles in film and TV didn't seem like they

217
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:46,120
were going to make her a star in their own rights, but as she became more ingrained in Hollywood culture, her

218
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:51,240
status as an outgoing person who could hold a friendly conversation, but also deliver some strong social messaging,

219
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:57,000
provided her with a different kind of appeal, one that did transcend most fleeting pop culture bullshit, and with that sort of

220
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,640
brand and the proven success that had come with it, there was a genre that seemed like a good fit.

221
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:05,160
Welcome to the Late Late Show everybody.

222
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,200
Let's talk about it.

223
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:16,920
Talk shows are a genre that I've addressed before. Although I focus more on the daytime genre rather than nights, they do share a lot of

224
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:22,760
similarities, so I don't want to repeat myself too much. However, besides the obvious aesthetic differences, I'd say late night

225
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:28,840
talk shows play off a stricter blueprint than a lot of their daytime counterparts. Now, there is variety, and each late night host

226
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:34,040
has their own personal flair, but most played a pretty safe game as long as the numbers they pulled were satisfactory enough.

227
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:39,160
Another key difference I'd say about late night talk show hosts is that many of them leaned into social commentary more

228
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:44,520
heavily than their daytime counterparts, being able to dispense an opinion on a controversial matter was becoming

229
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:49,480
increasingly sought after, especially in a world where current affairs were becoming more and more emotionally provocative

230
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:55,480
subjects. In the past few decades, the media industry in general has increasingly diversified its roster of figureheads,

231
00:20:55,480 --> 00:21:01,000
however with a few exceptions, late night talk shows have mostly remained dominated by a very specific type of person.

232
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,320
It's also important to note that many of these hosts had been on the air for over a decade, and although there's nothing

233
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:10,680
wrong with the media stalwart, by the end of the 2010s there was a huge untapped demographic, as a majority of younger

234
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:16,520
generations were consuming content from sources outside of cable TV. Now, late night talk shows had long held

235
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:22,760
their own on YouTube. As a matter of fact, Lilly Singh's appearances on 2014 and 2015 Rewind were alongside a fair few

236
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:28,040
late night hosts as well. This is in part because of YouTube's long-standing relationship with late night TV. NBC

237
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:33,160
partnered with YouTube in 2006, and some credit the variety of late night clips as playing a role in Google's

238
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:38,440
acquisition of YouTube. To this day, many major networks have contracts with the video sharing platform for monetization

239
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:43,480
and adsense, with network executives viewing YouTube as a distribution partner, and with some channels scoring up to

240
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:49,400
250 million views a month, it's hard to see it as anything else. As noted, late night talk shows have always

241
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:54,760
coasted off the individual personality more than a lot of other broadcasts. The rancors were able to build a rapport

242
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:59,320
with the live audience and YouTube viewer alike, and although you'd be hard pressed to say they had the sort of

243
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:04,600
relationship with their subscribers that many content creators did, there were obvious parallels, and their presence

244
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:09,720
on the YouTube platform was notably greater than other TV programs. However, in spite of its popularity on the

245
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:15,080
video sharing platform, the genre was still mostly removed from YouTube in its presentation, still playing to what

246
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:20,440
they knew best. For a lot of late night talk shows, that sort of stability in a highly competitive industry was

247
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:25,560
something the executive valued, but even after the ratings spike that the election of Donald Trump provided them,

248
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:30,600
there were still signs that current popularity was waning a little. Late night needed a fresh face on the scene.

249
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:35,640
YouTube was a good litmus test for what the market enjoyed without the boardrooms and arbitrations.

250
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:40,840
It was like a mass focus group, if the right kind of figure on YouTube could hold down their entire channel,

251
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,840
then who knows what else they could be capable of.

252
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:51,080
They don't know you, how giant you are on YouTube. 7.6 million subscribers, over 1 billion views. 1 billion.

253
00:22:52,360 --> 00:23:00,600
You were named in Forbes 30 under 30, and you just did a worldwide tour, 27 cities and 31 shows. Congratulations, pal.

254
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,840
Thank you so much, thank you. Well done.

255
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:07,480
Lee Singh seemed like the prime candidate for that sort of role. She had a proven record on YouTube and in

256
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:12,200
Hollywood, not just as an entertainer and a comedian, but also as a person whose words held relative value

257
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:16,360
in their circles, who would intertwine that social commentary with those amusing anecdotes.

258
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:20,760
The increasing diversification of the market around her, yet the lack of representation on the late night

259
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:25,880
circuit left a comfortable niche for her to fill. However, that opening would need to present itself first.

260
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:32,040
But that was just around the corner. The year is 2019, and NBC were just wrapping up the long-term

261
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:36,920
talk show Last Call with Carson Daly. Daly wished to focus on his other TV projects more, and felt

262
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:41,800
that the talk show had run its course after 17 rather fruitful years. The NBC chairman sensed

263
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:46,520
an opportunity, stating to interviewers that he saw the time slot's potential to become a creative

264
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:51,400
playground, which would focus more on relevancy in the digital age. The alleged first choice of

265
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:56,760
the studio was Chrissy Teigen, but she declined, and not too long after, the producer of Conan,

266
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:00,680
John Irwin, proposed Singh as a possible replacement, citing her ability to balance

267
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:04,920
comedy and serious commentary. Lilly had previously appeared with Conan, so Irwin seemed like a

268
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:09,480
reasonable enough source, and with this in mind, NBC approached Singh, and together with her company

269
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:14,280
Unicorn Island Productions, began to plan out what would become A Little Late with Lilly Singh.

270
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:18,520
The MO was clear, the political commentary of many talk show hosts had taken up enough space,

271
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:22,760
so Lilly would supposedly be replicating what had made her YouTube channel such a success,

272
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:27,320
the comedic portrayal and narrative surrounding her experiences and unique background. On paper,

273
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:31,400
this made a lot of sense, I said that earlier Ian and Anthony from Smosh couldn't speak about their

274
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:36,600
experiences as a brown girl, well neither could Jimmy Fallon, Stephen Colbert, or James Corden,

275
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:40,360
and the fact was that the format of late night shows allowed narratives to be based around the

276
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:44,440
host, and Singh should have been able to bring some fresh perspectives to what was then a very

277
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:50,200
tired genre. When news of this broke, it was met with hope, intrigue, and some skepticism, for many

278
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:54,280
Lilly represented a new generation of talk show hosts, she was the first ever late night presenter

279
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:58,920
to openly identify as bisexual, hell on announcement she was going to be the only female

280
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:03,240
heading up a major late night program, and even though she wasn't the first, this news was met

281
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:07,240
with praise by many who felt that the current register of TV hosts left a fair bit to be

282
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:11,640
desired. For some, regardless of what she said, Lilly Singh was already going to be a breath of

283
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:16,600
fresh air in an atmosphere that for some had grown very stale. However, although many welcomed this

284
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:21,240
news, there was still an air of uncertainty as to whether her signature flair would translate into

285
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:25,400
such a format. It was true that there were a lot of similarities between being the face of a YouTube

286
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:29,640
channel and being the face of a talk show, but there was also one key difference, that being

287
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:34,360
talk shows are just much higher production value, and although that can often be a positive facet,

288
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:39,240
can sacrifice the homegrown charm and spontaneity of a YouTube channel. Lilly would have a full

289
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:43,640
camera crew, script writers, producers, and she did obviously have her own studio involved as

290
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:47,480
well, but there was the lingering question of how much she could make the talk show her own

291
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:52,360
with so many other hands involved. Lilly showed that she could make it into Hollywood, but she

292
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:56,760
never did it using the exact same skill set that had garnered her a following on YouTube.

293
00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:02,120
The news that she would be utilising that YouTube basis once more could be for better or for worse,

294
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:06,440
but at this stage one could only speculate. In this case, the proof of the pudding was

295
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:12,200
in the eating. But did people have the appetite for it? Well, there was only one way to find out.

296
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:30,280
On the 12th September, a channel by the name of A Little Late with Lilly Singh posted a YouTube

297
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:35,560
video titled How Lilly Singh Really Built Her Show. It fabricates a rather far-fetched story

298
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:39,720
about the origins of A Little Late, but drops the necessary details that would be required to

299
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:43,800
understand the show. It also provides an impression of the sort of sketches that Lilly might be

300
00:26:43,800 --> 00:27:09,400
performing. It definitely integrates some of her commentary elements from her videos,

301
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:13,400
but seems to do it more in a running narrative format, whereas in the past her commentary for

302
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:17,800
content had felt more like a voiceover. This style seemed to aim to assimilate the two more,

303
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:22,120
and overall viewers seemed to enjoy it with many devotees commenting their appreciation.

304
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:26,280
It was only a day later that NBC actually released a preview on their own network,

305
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:30,280
showing that Lilly clearly still valued using YouTube as a platform, and it should have been

306
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:35,560
a sign of good things to come. A Little Late with Lilly Singh made its debut on the 16th September

307
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:40,040
with an opening monologue that touched on her heritage, her background, and her status amongst

308
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:43,560
many other late-night hosts who she was sharing the scene with. Lilly Singh- Look, I get it,

309
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:48,360
okay? I'm not your traditional talk show host. I mean, the media has mentioned I'm a bisexual

310
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:53,400
woman of colour so much that I feel like I should just change my name. A little long,

311
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:59,480
but it has a nice ring to it. Come on, I'm more than just a bisexual woman of colour, okay? It's

312
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:05,080
a complete coincidence that I chose a network whose logo is also the Pride flag. The set seems

313
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:09,560
almost designed to create the atmosphere of a late-night comedy club, one which places Lilly

314
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:13,080
at the forefront of the stand-up scene as she delivers jokes that wouldn't seem out of place

315
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:17,560
for that sort of environment. Alongside her gags, visual aids appeared on screen for viewers to

316
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:21,640
provide some additional humour, though sometimes it felt a bit on the nose for what it was trying

317
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:27,800
to explain. Lilly- I mean, real talk, if you put every network late-night host in one room together,

318
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:33,640
and then add me and Hasan Minhaj, we look like the IT department at their law firm's customs party.

319
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:38,520
This format was accompanied by interviews, the first episodes being with writer and actor Mindy

320
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:43,480
Kaling, though Office co-star Rainn Wilson makes a brief appearance too. Alongside some sketches,

321
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:48,920
most notably one baptised Lilly Singh Knocks Down the Door of Late Night, which featured Lilly

322
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:52,920
performing one of her signature raps, explaining why she is not like other late-night talk show

323
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:55,080
hosts, all while girl-bossing it to the top.

324
00:28:55,080 --> 00:29:03,640
Lilly- Hello my name is Lilly, and I ain't a white man. My skin got some colour, and it ain't a spray tan.

325
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:09,800
I know you're used to only jimmies in the spotlight, but I'ma throw some melanin up in your late night.

326
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:13,960
Alongside the release of this first episode was a flurry of promotional campaigns, including

327
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:17,800
appearances on other late-night TV shows. She could do this as unlike other late-night hosts,

328
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:22,200
her shows weren't actually broadcast live, and had all been pre-recorded to fit in with her hectic

329
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:25,880
schedule. Overall, the promotional campaign seemed to work, as the clips on her YouTube

330
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:29,400
channel appeared to garner significant traction, but what would the reviews say?

331
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:33,400
Well, many critics seemed to laud her fresh perspective and approach on late-night television,

332
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:37,560
some going as far as to label it revolutionary. There were some critics who didn't enjoy a

333
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:41,480
staccato interviewing style of Mindy, never really allowing the conversation to gather

334
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:45,880
substantial flow, and some weren't a fan of certain YouTubisms that she had brought over.

335
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:51,160
I start like, I'm being like, yeah, yeah, I was like that in high school too, you know,

336
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:57,640
which is like not true at all. And even the like dorks in Euphoria would have been Miss America.

337
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:02,200
They're so hot. No, 100% when I watch a show, I'm like, you're all so hot. You have two eyebrows,

338
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:06,760
what's that about? I didn't have that in high school. I didn't have that at all.

339
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:10,520
Now, critics aren't exactly the sort of people Lily was expecting to appease completely,

340
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:13,960
and maybe some of these professional reviewers were just a bit too old to understand such

341
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:18,600
aesthetic choices. The most important question pertained to what those on her native platform

342
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:24,920
thought, the people who she was meant to appeal to. Well, it wasn't exactly unanimous positivity.

343
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:28,120
Her opening monologue and sketch were the clips that attracted the most criticism,

344
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:31,240
with many finding the humour too heavy-handed and repetitive.

345
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:43,160
As you probably noticed, there are a few references to her unique status as a bisexual

346
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:47,160
minority on the telly, and although that was a breath of fresh air in the current environment,

347
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:51,960
some felt that it had become the basis for too many jokes, some of which seemed to imply that

348
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:56,200
people would be offended to see someone of her ethnicity on stage, which doesn't really make

349
00:30:56,200 --> 00:31:00,680
sense given other figures that came before her. With this in mind, commenters seemed to feel that

350
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:05,000
she was giving herself a bit too much credit, others just found the humour rather cringe,

351
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:09,560
in particular rap, which despite being based on early YouTube content, didn't seem to land with

352
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:14,120
the grace that those videos had done so before. It seems that those from mainstream media and

353
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:18,360
those from YouTube both saw very different issues with Lilly Singh's show. Whereas some from the

354
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:22,520
mainstream felt that certain technical choices didn't feel in keeping with late night talk shows

355
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:26,600
at the time, many viewers just felt that the humour fell flat as a whole. Now we know that

356
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:30,920
critics and audiences often look for different elements in media, that's why the scores can

357
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:35,640
sometimes be extremely different. However, I think although both sects of the internet had their own

358
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:40,120
qualms with the show, most would agree that the general critical consensus was far more positive

359
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:44,920
than the audience one. Now many would argue that critical approach is much more important than the

360
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:49,480
opinions of those on the internet, as critics do their job professionally, and many look towards

361
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:54,520
critical reviews before making decisions on what shows to tune into. However, Lilly Singh's decision

362
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:59,000
to make parts of her show immediately available to viewers online made much of the critical response

363
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,560
redundant, as a YouTube clip could typically encompass an entire sketch, rather than a small

364
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:08,280
segment from a film per se, a prospective audience member would be able to make a much more holistic

365
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:11,960
judgement on whether this was something worth watching, and it was clear that for some that

366
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:16,440
simply wasn't the case. Nonetheless, although YouTube comments and like dislike ratings can

367
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:20,280
reflect the response of a certain audience, they don't have too much individual bearing on the

368
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:24,440
well for every TV show. If certain viewers don't like it, they don't have to watch it.

369
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:29,320
Maybe this show simply wasn't for them. However, that was not enough for some.

370
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:36,440
I feel like a lot of people may be a little bit upset that the entire four minutes of this is just

371
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,640
random jokes about race.

372
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:42,760
And maybe Lilly's background was coming back to bite her.

373
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:53,160
By 2019, there was quite a significant space on YouTube for media criticism in general.

374
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:56,840
It was particularly popular with the rise of reaction-infused content in this genre,

375
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:00,200
mainly due to the increasing accessibility of source material as a whole.

376
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:04,440
Most of this originated from YouTube or other platforms such as TikTok, and normally entailed

377
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:09,240
a commentator explaining which teen idol couldn't actually sing. However, this had also extended

378
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:12,600
into the realm of talk shows in the past, particularly with the popularity of shows like

379
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:16,840
Dr. Phil, who also held a relatively strong YouTube presence. Nevertheless, in spite of

380
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:21,160
their often considerable view count, late night talk show hosts were never subject to too much

381
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:26,040
commentary, mainly because of how inoffensive their core content was. Lilly Singh's content

382
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:29,800
wasn't particularly offensive either, and in many ways, the negative response experienced

383
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:33,560
to the first episode of her show could have been ephemeral, and yet it wasn't.

384
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:39,240
In fact, over the following weeks, the widespread lampooning of many of the clips from her opening

385
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:44,040
show went viral across the platform, mainly because of how many topical debates it seemed to hit.

386
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:48,760
It's crazy, like it's very groundbreaking because, you know, it's always just been pasty white dudes,

387
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:54,120
you know, that's always been the trend, it's always been that, and now it's like, finally, finally!

388
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:57,240
And I don't think there would have been any buzz, I don't think anybody would have a problem with it,

389
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:02,120
but her and her team made the big mistake of just making it all about that, making it all about her

390
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:08,280
being a woman of color, like, look at me, and move over, move over, white people! It's the brown

391
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:12,120
woman's gain now! There were obviously those who had a political angle on it, particularly

392
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:16,520
with much of the human being identity-based, but videos on these subjects spanned across

393
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:20,920
all genres. As noted, one of the major criticisms from online viewers was that Lilly's jokes were

394
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:25,880
rather awkward, or cringe, which I think is a detail worth noting down, because as I'm sure we all know,

395
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:30,440
as excruciating as it can be to watch, cringe is a great source of views for a lot of creators,

396
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:35,560
even in a format as basic as cringe compilations, which are accompanied by no commentary whatsoever.

397
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,520
THE VACCINE!

398
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:41,080
Shut the fuck up.

399
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:45,720
But let's be honest, a lot of late night shows have their unfunny moments, especially unfunny to

400
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:49,640
a lot of netizens at least. Cringe comedy is off to the heart of a lot of these shows,

401
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:53,160
what was so special about Lilly Singh? Well, there are a few reasons this became such a

402
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:57,240
perfect storm of publicity. The first was simply because it was a new show on the block, whenever

403
00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:01,080
something new happens, there is always a gap in the market for those who react to it, so almost

404
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:04,440
immediately there were a fair few videos that provided their thoughts on Lilly's new venture,

405
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:08,840
most of which, as we know now, were not the most praising. From there on, it's a domino effect of

406
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:13,160
reaction videos. Secondly, Lilly's choice to use YouTube as a platform to prioritize distribution

407
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:17,080
of her content cut out the risk of certain negative, critical, or word-of-mouth opinions

408
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:21,000
restricting viewership. However, this backfired because then people's only interest in watching

409
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:25,640
reviews or reactions to her content was for entertainment purposes, which bolstered content

410
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:29,880
taking the piss out of her show. Most people don't read critical reviews for entertainment,

411
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:33,720
they will watch a YouTube video though, and they were available in spades.

412
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:37,480
It's pretty generally accepted that negative content will attract more views as a whole,

413
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:42,040
and is often the basis for more effective YouTube comedy, so it's little surprise that many aspiring

414
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:46,600
comedians saw it as just that. Then you have to consider her status as a large YouTube figure,

415
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:51,320
one that magnifies such relevance only further. For some mysterious reason, possibly related to

416
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:56,040
view count, though I couldn't possibly say why, many YouTubers enjoy talking about other YouTubers

417
00:35:56,040 --> 00:36:00,440
more than they do people of other mediums, and a YouTuber trying their hand at something else?

418
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:04,840
Oh well, that was a goldmine waiting to happen. However, one cannot blame environmental factors

419
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:09,000
alone for the scrutiny that the show found itself under. Although it's fair to say that certain

420
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,240
missteps would have probably been overlooked if they occurred elsewhere, they weren't here.

421
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:17,880
So, Lily, for your first episode, we're thinking you enter in a nice grey suit.

422
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:21,240
Grey? I prefer something a little more colourful, obviously.

423
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:24,520
Yeah, so do I. I like a pink one. Oh, you mean...

424
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,360
You don't mean it like that, do you?

425
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:32,360
Lee Sing-e presents herself as a champion for those underrepresented in media. She obviously

426
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:37,800
didn't explicitly say that, well, not too much, but by highlighting that aspect of her identity

427
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:41,640
and positioning herself as a figure on social commentary, she placed herself in a role that

428
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:45,320
was often held to quite rigorous standards. At the same time, she had built a lot of her

429
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:49,080
success on jokes about her own race. Watching her shows always felt like she was trying to

430
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:53,800
balance calling out certain stereotypes while also using them as joke fuel in other contexts.

431
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:58,760
I am so happy to be here, and by the looks of it, a lot of you are happy to be here too.

432
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:02,200
It's mostly the brown people because this was free to attend.

433
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:05,240
Probably the most notable incident in the first month of airing was when she made a

434
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:08,600
passing comment about towers on some children's heads resembling turbans.

435
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,440
Their hair really quickly. So, you know, it's a very practical thing.

436
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:15,560
I think they definitely had the turvy twist on when they...

437
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:21,960
This part raised more backlash at the time and Sing-e quickly apologized for this. It's

438
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:25,320
a sort of comment that probably would have flown under the radar on her YouTube channel,

439
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:28,920
particularly given her Sikh background. But here, every joke that could be interpreted

440
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:34,120
somewhat negatively was put under the magnifying glass. Even jokes that weren't necessarily her own,

441
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:36,040
which caused some controversy in itself.

442
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:57,480
This wasn't aided by the format of publication. With the traditional presentation of TV shows,

443
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:01,000
reception would be quite linear, talk shows are a hard craft of effects,

444
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:04,280
and it would be natural for someone's first episode to have a fair few hiccups.

445
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:07,960
However, people's attention would quickly move on to the second episode when it's released.

446
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:11,480
With YouTube, if a clip is notorious enough, it can provide discourse for months,

447
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:15,480
and therefore YouTube will prioritize it in the algorithm. So even though there were many more

448
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:19,320
clips uploaded to YouTube in the weeks after the first episode, people were still more likely to

449
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:22,840
receive an impression from the content that had provoked the greatest reaction earlier,

450
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:26,920
and although that may not have been representative of her shows, that was what was happening,

451
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:31,880
and by mid-October discourse had manifested into this incessant dunking on a few select clips that

452
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:35,800
were nearly a month old, but seemed to find new life every time a creator reacted to the

453
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:40,280
war Lily made a faux pas. Her content was essentially experiencing a negative variety

454
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:44,120
of sorts, with figures from all over the content spectrum chiming in on the matter.

455
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:48,360
YouTube, the platform that had not just launched Lily's illustrious career, but had seemed central

456
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:52,840
to the marketing of this new late-night venture, had seemingly reacted in the worst way possible,

457
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:56,920
but Lily herself, a YouTube megastar, would surely understand this scenario,

458
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:01,640
and know how to react accordingly, at least better than most Hollywood superstars, right?

459
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:04,360
So, how would she respond?

460
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:09,320
The reviews are from places like the Atlantic, Variety, CNN, Decider, Cosmopolitan, Deadline,

461
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:12,520
whereas before there were negative reviews from like, Angry Virgins.

462
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:13,900
Well.

463
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:24,520
Now as noted, Lily's show was pre-recorded, therefore it would be fair to question if Lily

464
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:29,080
could even adjust the objective of her broadcast on the basis of this response. Well you see,

465
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:34,520
it was pre-recorded as aforementioned, but all in late 2019, so they were still recording after

466
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:39,160
viewers watched and imparted their opinion of early episodes, and this did give Lily a platform

467
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:43,160
to respond to those who found her humour cringe, or didn't approve of its messaging.

468
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:45,080
So, how would she? Well.

469
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:06,200
At first she didn't appear to be too bothered, mostly ignoring any criticism,

470
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:10,520
unless it was proper controversy such as the turbo comment, however over time she did appear

471
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:14,760
to be paying more attention to what people said. At first mocking the comments in the above clip,

472
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:19,240
but barely a few days after that episode had aired, Lily took to Twitter in a rather sour mood.

473
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:21,320
Her tweet on October 22nd read,

474
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:41,960
In a way this statement isn't entirely false, we've seen a lot of creators

475
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:46,680
consumed by negativity because of the topics of their content, if you deal with the worst people,

476
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:51,640
sometimes you begin to see the worst in people. However, I think the problem is that this seemed

477
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:57,000
like a passive aggressive response to the people criticising, or making fun of her show, which

478
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:01,480
for a lot of people, really was not that deep. Now Lily is entitled to say whatever she wished

479
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:05,400
to say, but she must have had some grasp on how this would provoke further response,

480
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:08,920
and just like clockwork it did, because if there's one type of person on the internet

481
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:13,720
loves to dunk on more than people trying to be funny but being cringe, it's people who can't

482
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:17,960
take criticism, and Lily seemed like one of those people right then, with many providing

483
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:21,560
recent responses to distinguishing hate from legitimate criticism.

484
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:25,640
She goes on a big rant about why drama channels are bad, and she actually finishes the tweet with

485
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:30,120
a message to the only people who can stand her content. Young kids, don't follow this example,

486
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:33,560
it's not good for the soul or the longevity of your career, don't make me do it Lily,

487
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:36,840
you're really tempting me here, don't make me shorten my own career span.

488
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:41,240
I think her replies annoy people in the way that it almost demonstrated a lack of understanding

489
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:45,480
in how YouTube operated and thrived, which as a former YouTuber you'd think she would

490
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:49,640
have an abundance of. Sure, the website had evolved in the years since Lily had pursued

491
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:54,120
her Hollywood dreams, but it still operated on the same tenets that she had found success with.

492
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:58,680
Most of the viewers who watched her content and supported her career didn't just disappear from

493
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:03,160
the platform, they hadn't been consumed by the negativity, they just no longer followed

494
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:07,560
her with the same enthusiasm they had in the past. This response may have been one that was

495
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:11,240
rooted in frustration at public response to her content, she clearly didn't feel it was

496
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:15,480
representative of the show as a whole, and she probably had a point, but rather than just

497
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:19,720
suggesting that people watch more of the show, it was almost a tit for tat, she had to cherry

498
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:23,080
pick responses and strawman perspectives to get even with her haters.

499
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:43,320
But

500
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:47,960
maybe she did know, maybe she did realise that this was the sort of response that such statements

501
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:52,840
would provoke. Perhaps in a way she saw the online criticism as potential free promotion for future

502
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:56,920
episodes. This theory would make sense in a way because every time the coverage on YouTube had

503
00:42:56,920 --> 00:43:01,000
the potential to die a death, Lily would make some sort of public acknowledgement of it, and creators

504
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,840
would feel inclined to issue further responses, probably the most notable one of these coming

505
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:09,320
from a creator by the name of Drew Gooden, whose video Leaving the YouTube Bubble has amassed over

506
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:13,720
15 million views, and is the second most viewed video on his channel. That's a lot of people

507
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:17,880
talking about Lily Singh, I think you could easily look at many of the late night controversies and

508
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:22,200
think that actually sometimes leaning into the controversial side of you can generate a lot of

509
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:26,280
views. Hell, it had worked pretty successfully for some late night hosts whose views had stagnated

510
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:38,680
at points. Some would argue that this was just modern day marketing, that as long as people were

511
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:43,080
talking about her she had done her job, and for a while it obviously worked. However, I think the

512
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:47,480
point of farming criticism is that it really depends who you're farming it from. With other late

513
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:51,320
night hosts, a lot of their content received negative attention from people who were never

514
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:55,480
going to watch their show anyway, particularly given the fact that they often utilised political

515
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:59,560
topics that were designed to be divisive. With Lily, some of the criticism was coming

516
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:03,960
from her own target audience, and much of it wasn't merely based on her political opinions.

517
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:08,200
Now, a fair few criticisms towards Lily were politically motivated, especially people who

518
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:12,440
felt her humour was racist, but there were a lot of general criticisms as well relating to

519
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:17,160
presentation and execution of the show, criticisms that I don't think would have necessarily existed

520
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:20,840
if they weren't issues to begin with. Additionally, even some politically motivated

521
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:25,000
criticisms came from audiences who you'd think would appreciate her more progressive sense of

522
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,000
humour, particularly those who felt she was appropriating certain cultures, or that her

523
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:33,560
self-deprecating humour perpetuated negative stereotypes. I think the problem was that many

524
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:37,800
of those who were critical were viewers who could have been won over if the show was managed

525
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:42,360
correctly. In that sense, Lily's response did not invite them to watch further. But what about those

526
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:47,240
who were invited? I've been an on-camera audience member a couple of times for this similar type of

527
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:51,480
show, so that's why I felt I was qualified to review the show in this way. I feel I have a

528
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:56,200
good understanding of what's a normal use of the applause sign, what's a normal use of a warm-up

529
00:44:56,200 --> 00:45:00,360
in the beginning, what's a normal amount of production, crew involvement, taping, etc.

530
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:05,000
General things that most shows like this need, and I can honestly say that I was surprised by

531
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:09,160
how overproduced A Little Late with Lily Singh is. A good video on this was published by the

532
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:13,640
YouTuber Swell Entertainment, named I Was A Little Late with Lily Singh Audience Member.

533
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:17,640
Swell details the experience of being in the audience on multiple occasions, delivers some

534
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:21,400
technical criticism of the show, and imparts some anecdotes from her time at the studio.

535
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:26,200
Riko started talking to me before the taping of the second episode. He was not shy about the fact

536
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:30,920
that he knew all the crew, and that he was in fact working for the show. He said he had attended so

537
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:35,000
many tapings that Lily had taken notice, and offered to try and find him a job for the show.

538
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:39,240
He told me that his job varied, but for the most part it boiled down to him being in fact

539
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:43,800
a paid audience member. Lily doesn't seem to have a problem with people knowing that Riko

540
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:45,720
works on the show as an audience member.

541
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:54,360
Aside from when the show is actually being taped,

542
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:12,920
however, the most interesting information comes towards the end of the video, when she mentions

543
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:17,480
the presence of NBC executives, and the tension it caused at the studio, particularly regarding

544
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:19,160
Lily Singh's monologue subjects.

545
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:23,560
Lily's monologue became a Twitter moment because she did a whole monologue talking about being

546
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:28,600
bisexual woman, and how she had come out about a year prior, and how no one should get to dictate

547
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:32,680
how much she talks about being a bi woman of color, and I'm conflicted on this. If it was

548
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:36,440
an earlier episode, I would have applauded you for the statement, because then I would have known

549
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:41,000
that, okay stand your ground, see how it goes over, and then if it doesn't work out, clearly

550
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:45,720
me standing my ground is not keeping people watching, and it's not helping reviews. People

551
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:49,720
don't care that I'm standing my ground. They still don't think the jokes are funny. They don't like

552
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:53,240
the games. They don't like the interviews. They don't want x, y, and z. They think the show should

553
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:57,960
be canceled. I would have known that you would have had time to adjust, and you know grow as a

554
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:03,080
show, and grow as a late night host. However, I know that this was the fourth to last episode

555
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:08,680
that was recorded, and I know that this was one of four episodes that I attended over the span of

556
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:12,920
three months, and I'll tell you something, Lily. I saw zero growth in that time.

557
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:16,840
The impression was that Lily wasn't really interested in adjusting her scope on the basis

558
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:22,360
of the criticism, and on that basis, the show was staring down a rather imminent cancellation.

559
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:26,440
A Little Late with Lily Singh is not your YouTube channel. You're on the top of the food chain at

560
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:30,200
your YouTube channel. For your channel, you have people that work for you. You are in charge of

561
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:35,000
them. Over at Siren Studios where A Little Late with Lily Singh is filmed, sure you are also in

562
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:39,000
charge over there. The thing is though is that that's not your building. It's NBC's building.

563
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:44,040
Your show is not on your YouTube channel. It's on NBC's network, and their slot, and they get to

564
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:48,760
decide whether or not they renew or cancel your show. The fact that they placed you at Siren

565
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:53,960
Studios away from NBC Studios alone should show you that you are erasable. If you're not making

566
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:57,560
them stupid amounts of money, they will just get rid of your show. It doesn't matter what

567
00:47:57,560 --> 00:48:02,680
The Atlantic or CNN says about you, because the critics are not the people watching 90%

568
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:06,920
of the time, and your viewership is dwindling, and I don't know what else to say.

569
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:09,400
But enough speculative talk. What actually happened?

570
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:13,960
Lily, I hope NBC gives A Little Late with Lily Singh a second chance. I don't think they will,

571
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:17,640
but if they do, I think you need to look at the possibility of needing to do a rebrand. But it's

572
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:21,560
also pointless for me to say that because you getting a second season will just re-establish

573
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:25,720
in your mind that, oh, what I've been doing is fine, because clearly that's what got me a second

574
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:29,640
season, so I just need to keep doing what I've been doing. Lily, you're not the first person who

575
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:32,840
has tried to do something outside of YouTube, and the reason a lot of them are able to start

576
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:37,480
to try and do that is because they have what can get them in the door. They've got the well-known

577
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:41,080
face, they've got the numbers, but they don't have what it takes to keep them in the room.

578
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:42,600
Show me why you deserve to stay here.

579
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:56,840
As the first season progressed, the ratings were overall reported to be consistent with the final

580
00:48:56,840 --> 00:49:01,640
season of Carson Daly, which some may have cited as reason to consider the show an overall triumph.

581
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:05,560
However, considering that this was touted as a show that was breaking down walls and tearing

582
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:09,720
up the late night scene as we know it, considering how much publicity the debut season of this show

583
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:14,280
received in comparison to the final one of Carson Daly, it would be hard not to find such data

584
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:18,600
somewhat disappointing for what it was trying to do. This was a person who could command a channel

585
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:22,840
that would regularly pull in millions of viewers a video, someone who was meant to be going toe to

586
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:27,080
toe with the late night jimmies, and yet in spite of all the controversy, the performance felt

587
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:31,880
surprisingly tame. With all this in mind, it felt like Lily's route in addressing all that transpired

588
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:35,880
had brought attention to the show, but not necessarily the right kind. Although videos

589
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:40,200
criticising her had brought in plenty of views, much of the content didn't drive people towards

590
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:44,440
this new network backed venture, likely leaving some to wonder whether this risky project would

591
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:49,000
be able to maintain such ratings when online coverage died down. Would it even be worth the

592
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:54,280
second season all things considered? Well, going off what I've said so far, I wouldn't blame you

593
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:57,720
for being under the impression that this would have been the end of the late night circuit for

594
00:49:57,720 --> 00:50:02,440
Lily Singh. If NBC were hoping that this would be the gambit that paid off, it hadn't really returned

595
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:06,760
many dividends, and all things considered, in spite of the trailblazing narrative, everybody

596
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:10,680
else seemed to think that this trail had been run. Given that episodes on made talk shows were

597
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:15,080
temporarily placed on hold at the start of 2020, people thought it would be a fitting time to put

598
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:32,520
this experiment to bed. On YouTube in particular, the narrative had mostly been established that

599
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:36,760
this was likely the end of Lily Singh as we know it. I think the idea that the show would be

600
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:40,680
cancelled was good clickbait, and played into the predominant outlook on the matter.

601
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:44,760
Throughout the start of 2020, there didn't appear to be much news on the fate of Lily Singh's late

602
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:49,160
night show, and this led to more speculation, but there was probably one more piece of important

603
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:53,880
information that led to hesitancy to decide on its fate. I know it's not the most fun topic to

604
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:58,200
talk about, and I can't blame anyone for switching their ears off now, but it probably is one of the

605
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:03,560
most relevant to today's video. As we know, in 2020, the world was deep in the clutches of the

606
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:08,040
coronavirus, and amidst concern relating to the contagion of the disease, governments in many

607
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:12,280
countries and American states urged people to socially distance and work from home where

608
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:16,840
possible. This included the state of California and Los Angeles County, which enforced austere

609
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:21,240
restrictions on social contact between parties who didn't share the same household. This was bad news

610
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:25,640
for Hollywood, whose output typically required the input of a large workforce, and made filming

611
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:30,120
anything safely practically impossible. This was particularly relevant for talk shows, which not

612
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:34,920
just relied on studio crew, but guest appearances and an audience to provide that necessary

613
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:38,920
atmosphere. There were serious questions looming as to how they would be able to generate this

614
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:43,000
environment without many of the seemingly essential elements that these shows demanded.

615
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:46,920
However, with everyone at home and spending more time than ever in front of their screens,

616
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:49,080
networks weren't ready to be caught slacking.

617
00:51:49,080 --> 00:52:02,200
Hi guys, this is Jimmy Fallon, and this is the Tonight Show Home Edition, I guess you can call it.

618
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:07,800
We really don't know what this is, but I wanted to put something out there for you guys so that we

619
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:16,040
can just have some levity in these bizarre times. It didn't take long for a new format to be

620
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:19,560
launched, and for many talk show hosts, this encompassed the presenter hosting from their

621
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:24,040
humble abode. They'd be accompanied by a couple crew members fully masked up, a guest on their

622
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:28,280
television set, and an audience of people attending remotely. There were many people who

623
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:32,680
definitely enjoyed this more laid back ambiance, but it's hard to say that some of these hosts felt

624
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:38,200
completely at home, no pun intended, with the new setting. If only there was someone who could be.

625
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:42,920
COVID also means that we can't have an audience for your tapings. Are you going to be able to

626
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:46,440
handle working without the energy of a live audience? Yeah, that sounds a lot like YouTube,

627
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:48,040
and I don't know if I have enough experience.

628
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:52,760
Due to its recording schedule, the first season of A Little Late ran into the implementation of

629
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:57,240
social distancing. However, when the time came around to consider renewal, much to some people's

630
00:52:57,240 --> 00:53:02,520
surprise, NBC decided to do just that. On May 13th, it was announced that A Little Late with

631
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:06,760
Lilly Singh would be returning for a second season at the start of 2021. There were many

632
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:11,240
reasons cited for this, although viewership wasn't quite as high as it could be. The show

633
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:15,560
led all first year shows in the number of social media engagements, with NBC lauding her as an

634
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:19,800
incredible talent who brought an expanding global audience to the network. I think it's a valid

635
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:23,800
point, although a cursory view may tell you that ratings weren't the best. If you're bringing

636
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:27,880
700,000 new viewers to a network, then you're likely doing more than a person who may pull

637
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:32,040
1 million already existing viewers. In this scenario, the social media response aided the

638
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:35,880
show. Even if most potential viewers thought it was bad, the debate that it created online

639
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:39,880
reeled in many individuals who hadn't ever engaged in late night TV as a genre,

640
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:44,280
at least not to the degree that this discourse did. However, the evolving dominion that talk

641
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:48,600
shows could exist in was also probably the main cause for consideration. Household names were

642
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:52,760
being forced to downscale production to maintain it, and whereas some may not have been accustomed

643
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:56,280
to that style, especially those who were used to a lot of support, it was that style that

644
00:53:56,280 --> 00:54:00,280
established the careers of many online creators on a certain video showing platform.

645
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:18,120
This was Lilly Singh's moment, and she enthusiastically announced the second

646
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:21,960
season of her show on its official YouTube channel, inspiring excited responses from

647
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:26,280
many of her fans. Would she be up to the challenge, and would any criticism directed

648
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:30,840
towards her previously be heeded? This would all mean very little unless she gave people

649
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:35,400
reason to watch her. She may finally have a home advantage, but she still had many other

650
00:54:35,400 --> 00:55:02,040
contemporaries to compete with and wrestle viewership from. Well, in a video posted on

651
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:05,800
her personal blog channel the same day that season two was announced, she promised to do

652
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:10,200
just that, stating that although she was pleased with her work in season one, she knew there was

653
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:16,360
still a lot to be done. The truth is it was my season one of doing something brand new,

654
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:21,400
and season one Lilly reminded me a lot like first YouTube video Lilly, you know, everything takes

655
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:27,000
time, it takes practice, and the reason I communicate this is really just to say I'm proud

656
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:31,320
of season one, but I know there's a lot to improve on, and so when you give me feedback like why

657
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:35,160
doesn't she have this guest on her show? Why isn't she doing this? It's not for lack of trying,

658
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:45,160
it's just I'm trying to figure it out. But words can only say so much. Would it be done?

659
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:59,960
There are so many things I have learned, and I feel like going into season two what I'm really

660
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:04,680
excited about is taking all that knowledge, all the times I've made mistakes and stumbled and

661
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:09,560
was confused, now I know all that stuff, I still have a lot to learn, but I know some stuff now,

662
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:15,000
and I can step into season two just that much better. Much of 2020 was pretty quiet on the

663
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,920
announcements front of the TV show at the heart of this humble video, but in December it was

664
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:22,920
reported that the writing crew behind Little Later had been completely overhauled, with Lilly

665
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:27,080
revealing in a statement that she intended to bring more creativity to the table, it seemed

666
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:32,360
that she would have a bit more freedom to pursue her own visions, and on January 11th 2021 the

667
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:37,080
second season of A Little Late with Lilly Singh made its debut, and we would finally answer the

668
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:48,040
question, what has changed? Well, to be honest, a lot.

669
00:56:57,400 --> 00:57:01,560
In her video reflecting on season one, Lilly had acknowledged people's desire for more sketch

670
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:05,720
sequences, and the first upload from the new season onto the program's YouTube channel was just

671
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:09,960
that, a sketch in which Lilly plays a variety of characters, including the classic YouTube

672
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:14,840
caricatures of her family and Kamala Harris, whose similarities with Lilly are used as a foundation

673
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:18,840
of a joke that they are actually related. She also uploaded a version of this onto her personal

674
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:23,720
YouTube channel, with it amassing 1.7 million views as of today. This is the sort of sketch

675
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:27,640
where Lilly's nature play multiple characters worked very effectively in a COVID world that

676
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:31,720
aimed to minimise social contact. Although in the first series Lilly had committed to mostly

677
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:35,960
refraining from overtly political topics, the second season brought Lilly her rant room,

678
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:39,720
which would allow her to speak more candidly on subjects that mattered to her. These did include

679
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:43,640
some political subjects, which isn't surprising given that this was around the time of the

680
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:48,120
inauguration of then president-elect Joe Biden, and the resistance that such circumstances

681
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:52,360
precipitated, this being one of the first topics that Lilly addresses in her rant room.

682
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:58,440
We need all the positivity we can get, especially with the recent news of everything that has gone

683
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:03,320
down at the Capitol, and I'm gonna be honest, I have lost all patience for anyone that is still

684
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:07,160
questioning privilege. Additionally, interviews seem far more free-flowing. One of the most

685
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:11,080
common criticisms, even from established media critics, was that Lilly's nature to try and

686
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:15,320
interject her own jokes and punchlines seems to detract from the presence of the guest. In the

687
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:19,400
second season, Lilly still manages to interweave herself into certain questions, but at the same

688
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:23,080
time so that it doesn't take away from her company. It'd also be fair to say that Lilly's

689
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:26,840
second season probably did more work in altering the landscape of talk shows than her first one.

690
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:31,400
Over 20% of her guests on season 2 were making their late night debut, a very significant

691
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:36,120
percentage considering how many shows often tend to stick with certain safe choices for those spots.

692
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:39,720
Lilly often went with guests that she felt she'd be comfortable around, and it seemed to work

693
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:40,840
rather well for her.

694
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:47,960
You have such a level of confidence that I really love, also low-key want, and I feel like your

695
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:54,600
season 2, I'm trying to be the iciest version of myself. How can I be my iciest self for season 2?

696
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:55,560
Give me some pro tips.

697
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:59,880
So like, I see it's like a mentality, it's your hustle, so you know, maybe setting some

698
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:04,600
financial goals. I mean, I already know you a boss, you have your own show, so I can tell you

699
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:07,080
know, you already got your life figured out.

700
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:09,880
Interviews shortly after the first episode of the new season aired,

701
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:13,160
Lilly stated that she wanted to bring a degree of imperfection to the show,

702
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:17,000
and this is also pretty evident. A lot of content that would be typically cut out of

703
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:21,240
a larger scale production was left in, shots of the crew fully masked up, and the backstage

704
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:24,920
equipment may seem unprofessional in certain environments, but here it seemed to fit the

705
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:29,480
casual mise-en-scene rather effectively. Funnily enough, in spite of being restricted to a single

706
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:33,080
residence, Lilly seemed to find much more use for the set than she had in the first season,

707
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:35,560
utilising it for a variety of purposes and skits.

708
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:40,040
Lilly- I just want you to confirm that there is good spirits in here, and if there's bad spirits...

709
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:41,400
Lilly- Let's go throughout the whole house.

710
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:44,280
Lilly- I mostly just don't want them in hair and makeup, it's fine if they're in like the edit bay

711
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:47,160
and stuff like that, I'm just not trying to have them anywhere I am.

712
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:50,600
Now just because something is different doesn't mean that it's necessarily better,

713
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:54,520
and for some online it certainly wasn't. Many people who had criticised Lilly's first season

714
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:59,080
continued into the second, pointing out what they felt were shortcomings in this sort of content.

715
00:59:59,080 --> 01:00:02,840
Yes, this is the way we're used to seeing Lilly Singh and other YouTubers portrayed,

716
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:07,720
talking directly in front of a camera or sketches where they play more than one person in the same

717
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:12,840
scene, but it very much feels like an industry plant Lilly Singh instead of actual Lilly Singh,

718
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:17,320
simply because like any other TV show there are many people working on it,

719
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:22,680
and the more of Lilly's late show I watch, the less control I feel like she actually has over it.

720
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:26,280
And it's not like this criticism was without merit, certain aspects of Lilly's show

721
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:30,680
probably could be perceived as unnecessarily convoluted and lacking focus, the jokes were

722
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:35,000
hit and miss, and there were some pretty bad misses. However, the best metric to tell if

723
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:39,560
this sort of content was affected with its target audience was just to read the comments as always,

724
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:43,560
and in this season's case, the response was much more positive, and it's clear that these

725
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:47,720
weren't just fans who would say that regardless, there were many viewers who noted its improvement

726
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:51,800
on the previous season. Now this doesn't mean that negative comments didn't exist elsewhere,

727
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:55,560
or anywhere, but for the most part they provide the impression that these people would never

728
01:00:55,560 --> 01:01:00,040
really enjoy Lilly Singh anyway, or late night TV as a whole. It's important to remember that

729
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:04,600
late night shows can be a bit preachy and heavy handed with their humour and messaging,

730
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:09,160
trying to keep an audience entertained and pushing the envelope while not being crass

731
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:13,800
is a somewhat delicate art and you will fall short at points. Lilly Singh having some of that

732
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:18,120
wasn't a deal breaker for most people, and let's face it, she didn't necessarily build her career

733
01:01:18,120 --> 01:01:22,360
on subtlety. As a TV show working within the perimeter of a long established industry,

734
01:01:22,360 --> 01:01:26,680
there would always be some contrivances, but I think this was as close as many were going to get

735
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:31,400
to Lilly Singh actually being herself in the late night format, and for regular viewers of her,

736
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:35,160
that was a resounding victory. This appeared to be a resounding victory for Lilly as well,

737
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:38,760
who spoke about how she felt so much more comfortable in season 2, stating that she had

738
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:42,760
become tired of monitoring herself and her thoughts, and just chose to speak about whatever

739
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:46,200
was on her mind, prioritising that authenticity.

740
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:50,600
Like admittedly in season 1 I thought there were moments where I wasn't completely being myself,

741
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:55,160
maybe I was nervous or I felt a lot of pressure, and so with season 2 I'm really prioritising

742
01:01:55,720 --> 01:01:59,320
throwing all facades out the window, I want to be completely authentic, you know me and my

743
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:04,040
producers always have like little mini headbutt sessions because I'll be interviewing a guest

744
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:07,560
and they'll script something that's like, you know I love doing this movie, and I'll be like

745
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:12,200
I've never seen that movie, and I insist on being authentic about it because I don't want to lie,

746
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:16,680
I'd rather make the time to watch all of the things before I interview someone, and if I don't

747
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:21,080
have the time I'd rather be honest and say like, listen, people online are going crazy about you,

748
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:26,360
as opposed to like, I loved you in this movie and I'm such a big fan because I just feel like

749
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:30,760
it doesn't feel like it's real. It seems like the shackles that COVID had placed on society in

750
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:35,240
general had actually unshackled Lilly from a lot of the customs that late night TV was expected

751
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:39,720
to conform to, and for the first time Lilly Singh had room to embrace the environment that had

752
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:44,760
brought her so much prosperity on YouTube. Could this be the future of television talk shows?

753
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:47,960
Could Lilly Singh be the future of late night TV?

754
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:59,480
Sometimes there's very little you can do. Next time I hear anyone hating on Gen Z,

755
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:01,240
I'm just gonna tell them bye bye bye.

756
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:02,600
What?

757
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:06,440
Throughout the start of 2021, Lilly Singh's show appeared to be performing well with those who

758
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:10,280
engaged with it, however unfortunately it's also about the number of people who engaged with the

759
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:14,040
content in the first place, and in a time when numbers should have been boosted from people

760
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:19,480
staying at home and watching TV, Lilly Singh's ratings left a lot to be desired. In the extent

761
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:23,480
of her time on air, her viewership decreased approximately a quarter from her predecessor

762
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:27,800
Carson Daly, with this continuing to trend downwards in the second season. This was also

763
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:32,680
the case with YouTube, where views on videos would regularly fall below 100,000. Additionally,

764
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:37,320
as much as the home setting was pretty unique and well suited to Lilly's style, many shows were

765
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:40,760
beginning to venture back into the studio, and although it wouldn't have been impossible to

766
01:03:40,760 --> 01:03:44,360
continue the home setting which appeared to be popular with some viewers, it would've been a

767
01:03:44,360 --> 01:03:49,000
gamble as they didn't exactly embody the late night aesthetic that many had become used to.

768
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:53,160
Although it was true that Lilly brought a fair few new viewers to the network, there were still

769
01:03:53,160 --> 01:03:58,120
a lot of financial factors that NBC needed to consider, and in lieu of this, just under a month

770
01:03:58,120 --> 01:04:02,360
before the second season even concluded, it was announced that a little late with Lilly Singh

771
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:07,640
would not be returning for a third season, to the disappointment of fans and the joy of detractors.

772
01:04:07,640 --> 01:04:11,400
With that said, it was also announced that this was not the end of Lilly Singh's career at NBC,

773
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:15,480
and that she would be signing a first look contract with Universal for future unscripted

774
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:19,640
projects, which shows the network definitely saw the potential in much of her second season.

775
01:04:19,640 --> 01:04:23,400
It was also announced that she would be involved in the development of a comedy series with

776
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:29,160
Black-ish creator Kenya Barris, not a bad result. Overall, this news was framed by many outlets as

777
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:33,640
a recalibration rather than a cancellation. Lilly herself released a statement to social

778
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:37,080
media on the day of the announcement, stating that although they would be saying goodbye to

779
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:41,000
A Little Late with Lilly Singh, this would allow her to focus more on her production company and

780
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:44,600
her own projects. Additionally, she was very excited to share the aforementioned upcoming

781
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:49,080
enterprises that she would be working on, and to be honest, Lilly has every reason to feel optimistic

782
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:52,680
moving forward. As she had mentioned in an earlier video of hers, regardless of the reception

783
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:57,080
to her show, it had raised her profile notably, and even during its airing, the number of roles

784
01:04:57,080 --> 01:05:01,480
she secured increased significantly. This included acquiring further voice acting paths for two

785
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:05,880
animated feature films, an array of TV positions that would eventually lead to her being offered

786
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:10,600
a spot on the judging panel for Canada's Got Talent, and a host role for this year's Academy

787
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:11,720
Awards pre-show.

788
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:40,280
By all intents and purposes, endless doors have been opened due to her position in hosting a

789
01:05:40,280 --> 01:05:44,040
late night talk show, regardless of whether it was good or bad, and the future was looking

790
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:48,280
quite exciting for her. Lilly expressed optimism in moving forward with these undertakings,

791
01:05:48,280 --> 01:05:52,600
and bringing diversity to the screen in an even bigger way, and she's certainly not wrong. There

792
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:56,360
was little doubt that this was a great leap forward in her career, and work that would be

793
01:05:56,360 --> 01:06:00,840
turned down by very few people. As much fun as she probably had with the second season of her show,

794
01:06:00,840 --> 01:06:05,480
it was also a very demanding and time-consuming schedule, and this change in pace would probably

795
01:06:05,480 --> 01:06:10,200
give her a bit more breathing room to do what she wanted to, and on her own terms as well. With this

796
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:13,640
in mind, on the 23rd of July, Lilly returned to her YouTube channel.

797
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:27,880
Here she spoke about a variety of projects, but also stated that she was excited to be back on

798
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:32,840
YouTube, and making content that she had control over, promising to be more untamed than ever.

799
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:59,560
It seems that her enjoyment of sketches have been reignited once more, and over the coming weeks

800
01:06:59,560 --> 01:07:03,480
and months she posted many of these sketches onto her channel. These videos typically involved a

801
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:07,480
large cast and higher production values than her older content, but still attempted to convey that

802
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:28,120
same relatable sketch humour that propelled her to stardom. A couple of these videos picked

803
01:07:28,120 --> 01:07:32,040
up on the algorithm, but most performed pretty modestly for a channel of Lilly's size,

804
01:07:32,040 --> 01:07:36,600
scoring a similar count to her network ratings. The truth was that comedy on YouTube had headed

805
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:40,360
in a different direction in the last few years, either towards more commentary-driven content,

806
01:07:40,360 --> 01:07:45,320
or even shorter, more absurdist sketches like the ones you see on TikTok. The audience was evolving,

807
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:50,200
and many of Lilly's prospective viewers did lie in places other than YouTube. If one thing was clear,

808
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:54,520
it was that NBC quite liked Lilly Singh, and although they weren't willing to continue the

809
01:07:54,520 --> 01:07:59,400
talk show, they wanted to retain her abilities for future content, and both parties seemed happy with

810
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:03,480
that outcome. It's not hard to see why many thought a late night show catered towards a more

811
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:07,720
millennial audience should have legs. Unfortunately, it just didn't, and although

812
01:08:07,720 --> 01:08:11,400
there'll always be a recurring audience, the numbers have been dwindling for the past few

813
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:16,360
years, and Lilly's slot was already not considered prime time. Since Lilly's departure, other hosts

814
01:08:16,360 --> 01:08:20,920
who had broadcast at similar time slots had also left their programs, including Trevor Noah and

815
01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:25,400
James Corden. NBC themselves had stated they would not be replenishing the time slot, and subsequently

816
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:29,800
handed it back to affiliates in the following months, making Lilly the last host of a talk show

817
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:35,000
in that time slot held since 1988. From NBC's perspective, it was clear that it wasn't just

818
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:39,320
a Lilly problem, but a systemic one that wouldn't be so easy to resolve. Some presented the

819
01:08:39,320 --> 01:08:43,480
cancellation of Lilly Singh's talk show as a mercy killing, and although a network is seldom

820
01:08:43,480 --> 01:08:47,800
going to admit when something isn't working, the decision to discontinue programs at that specific

821
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:51,960
time slot after discontinuing Lilly's show probably implies they were struggling with that

822
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:57,320
period as it was, and Lilly Singh's show was much more a Hail Mary to save a struggling medium which

823
01:08:57,320 --> 01:09:02,760
less and less people were tuning into, rather than the destroyer of NBC bank balances. It seems

824
01:09:02,760 --> 01:09:07,240
evident that really, NBC were trying to ask a greater question. Lilly Singh was a creator with

825
01:09:07,240 --> 01:09:12,040
15 million subscribers on YouTube, could you translate that sort of digital success into a

826
01:09:12,040 --> 01:09:17,240
media-based viewership for a network TV show? The short answer in that case was, no.

827
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:22,440
Lilly Singh-"It's been an honor to be on your screens for two seasons. Thank you so much for all of your love

828
01:09:22,440 --> 01:09:27,720
and support and for betting on this crazy girl. I can't wait to see what we do together next.

829
01:09:27,720 --> 01:09:31,160
Until then, it's been fun." What's the long answer though?

830
01:09:39,720 --> 01:09:43,320
I think it's very easy to write off a little late with Lilly Singh as something that was doomed to

831
01:09:43,320 --> 01:09:47,000
fail from the start, and in a way I think there are a lot of valid arguments that could be made

832
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:51,960
to support that. We've already heard some of them. However, is there an alternative reality

833
01:09:52,040 --> 01:09:56,360
where a little late with Lilly Singh was actually an undisputed commercial and critical triumph?

834
01:09:56,360 --> 01:10:00,040
I'd say it was more possible than many might assume. First, we need to talk about the

835
01:10:00,040 --> 01:10:04,200
circumstances that surrounded the creation of a little late with Lilly Singh. Sure, it wasn't a

836
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:08,360
great time for talk shows, many believed this was in part due to the rise of streaming, and they may

837
01:10:08,360 --> 01:10:12,280
have had a point, but many clips from talk shows still performed well on YouTube, and even if they

838
01:10:12,280 --> 01:10:16,520
were losing their share of the market in one place, they still held down a reasonable audience in

839
01:10:16,520 --> 01:10:20,760
another. Lilly Singh's career was from YouTube, born and raised, and this should have been a

840
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:25,800
stomping ground. Although times were changing, they hadn't changed that quickly. When reading

841
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:29,720
comments about her late night show being launched, I noticed a trend of a lot of people saying they

842
01:10:29,720 --> 01:10:34,040
were happy for her, even though they didn't really watch her content anymore. I think that should

843
01:10:34,040 --> 01:10:38,600
have been considered when creating the show. Lilly was someone who didn't quite have the draw she

844
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:43,400
once had on YouTube, and late night talk shows faced the same problem on TV, but in a way that's

845
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:49,320
why it should have worked. But sure, people thought they had outgrown Lilly, and they definitely had

846
01:10:49,320 --> 01:10:54,440
on YouTube, but a more mature spin on her content is exactly what the late night world should have

847
01:10:54,440 --> 01:10:59,000
brought her, it should have been an open goal for that much at least. There are obviously a

848
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:03,160
wide spectrum of opinions on Lilly's technique, and I have to say it's not really my cup of tea

849
01:11:03,160 --> 01:11:07,160
personally, but when you've seen enough late night clips, you tend to gather a mental image for what

850
01:11:07,160 --> 01:11:12,440
is generally considered acceptable content for the genre, and Lilly's content wasn't exactly outside

851
01:11:12,440 --> 01:11:16,280
of that realm. If the second season showed us anything, it's that although there may be some

852
01:11:16,280 --> 01:11:20,440
who would never really enjoy Lilly's style, there definitely was a way to make her YouTube sketch

853
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:25,000
content compatible with some of the usual traffics of mainstream television. But, I hear you say,

854
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:29,240
season two was completely different to the first season, and late night television as a whole.

855
01:11:29,240 --> 01:11:33,800
Lilly was in an environment much closer to her original YouTube content, and you my friend are

856
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:37,800
not wrong, I'll grant you that much. But season two didn't just work the way it did because it

857
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:41,800
was in a house, it may have littered some pressure off Lilly's shoulders, but she still had to carry

858
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:46,120
the show in a way that she hadn't done before, and for many people she did just that. But how

859
01:11:46,120 --> 01:12:03,080
would it have translated into a studio environment? Well, I think she should have just taken more of a

860
01:12:03,080 --> 01:12:07,960
homegrown vibe to make it work. Lilly stated that she often felt confined in her sets and suits,

861
01:12:07,960 --> 01:12:11,960
and although there are often foundations of many late night talk shows, I don't think a lot of

862
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:16,120
people would have cared if she didn't care for them. It was the same reason a lot of people found

863
01:12:16,120 --> 01:12:20,360
the monologue somewhat laboured, it wasn't what was comfortable for her, and although sometimes

864
01:12:20,360 --> 01:12:24,120
it's good to learn new skills and abilities, trying to cram it in multiple recordings in

865
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:28,280
the space of a few months wasn't going to aid her development on that front, and many people

866
01:12:28,280 --> 01:12:33,000
noted how she did genuinely struggle with those aspects of the show. Drop the suits, drop the

867
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:36,840
monologues, Lilly worked best when she was surrounded by people who she could bounce her

868
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:40,920
energy off. In promoting her show, Lilly made a fair few appearances on other people's shows,

869
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:44,440
and in many comment sections you'd see audience members surprised that actually,

870
01:12:44,440 --> 01:12:47,400
she could have a pretty natural and free-flowing conversation.

871
01:12:47,400 --> 01:13:07,960
Lilly was a talented speaker in many regards, she often seemed the most comfortable when she

872
01:13:07,960 --> 01:13:11,720
was being impromptu, and if that talent was harboured correctly, there was no reason for

873
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:15,800
it not to work in a talk show environment, it really should have been a slam dunk as well.

874
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:19,800
The talk shows are still more than that, and as many observed this was a stale genre

875
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:23,800
that Lilly should have kicked the door in, but a lot of people felt she ultimately didn't manage

876
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:28,840
to. What could she have done differently to ensure that change? Lilly had made the bold decision to

877
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:33,160
not necessarily make current affairs the focal point of her content, and to completely avoid

878
01:13:33,160 --> 01:13:37,240
politics as a topic. This was framed as an active production choice, but also would have been

879
01:13:37,240 --> 01:13:41,000
imperative due to the recording schedule as there was no way to predict what subject would be

880
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:45,480
trending months after recording. It's a challenging objective to set oneself, and many would argue

881
01:13:45,480 --> 01:13:50,040
that it was simply impossible to do, because current affairs is how talk shows make themselves

882
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:53,960
relevant to their audience. Nevertheless, the movement towards YouTube for a lot of these

883
01:13:53,960 --> 01:13:58,360
programs did provide the potential for more timeless discourse, as content could be accessed

884
01:13:58,360 --> 01:14:02,680
in the months, years and decades after they aired. With that acknowledged, Lilly still needed to

885
01:14:02,680 --> 01:14:06,920
ensure that the subject she lined up could sufficiently propel an episode of her show.

886
01:14:16,440 --> 01:14:31,560
The topic she chose often related to her identity and experiences, and on the surface they weren't

887
01:14:31,560 --> 01:14:36,120
bad subjects to discuss or to channel into one's content, but the traditional monologue style of

888
01:14:36,120 --> 01:14:40,520
late night TV often made the delivery of these subjects somewhat forced and stiff. I think the

889
01:14:40,520 --> 01:14:44,920
show not tell aspect would have aided her here, people felt most empowered when she was able to

890
01:14:44,920 --> 01:14:49,480
express her identity without explicitly stating it, and it clearly held meaning to a lot of people

891
01:14:49,480 --> 01:14:54,120
that shouldn't have been overlooked. There was real potential here to change late night TV for

892
01:14:54,120 --> 01:14:59,000
the better. So yes, for what it's worth, I do think as a cosy late night show that perhaps didn't ask

893
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:02,840
too much of the viewer, and just featured Lilly shooting the shit with a variety of celebrities

894
01:15:02,840 --> 01:15:06,920
and channeling her energy and background in a unique way could have worked pretty effectively,

895
01:15:06,920 --> 01:15:11,000
even in a studio environment, and it still could have become that in time if a third season had

896
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:15,400
been greenlighted. The first season was quite the deep end to be thrown into, even as an established

897
01:15:15,400 --> 01:15:19,960
figure amongst Hollywood society. Lilly had never anchored a major talk show, let alone held a

898
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:24,440
prominent role in one, she'd done a few interviews and proven herself as a decent conversationalist,

899
01:15:24,440 --> 01:15:28,520
but when you introduce so many different features and accrue to a person who is often coasting off

900
01:15:28,520 --> 01:15:32,680
their own spontaneous nature, you're seriously complicating the formula. But it's not that I

901
01:15:32,680 --> 01:15:36,360
don't think it couldn't have worked in the right environment, it's just that in an attempt to

902
01:15:36,440 --> 01:15:41,000
provide Lilly Singh with proverbial stabilisers, the network overlooks what made her such an

903
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:44,920
effective talker and host in the first place. Those are the teething issues of the first season

904
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:51,080
that could have been alleviated over time, and in a way they were, yet it wasn't enough. Why?

905
01:15:51,640 --> 01:15:53,400
Well, first impressions are everything.

906
01:16:01,720 --> 01:16:05,880
I'm going to say something fairly uncontroversial right now, the first episode of A Little Late

907
01:16:05,880 --> 01:16:07,880
with Lilly Singh was not very good.

908
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:19,400
I appreciate that the critics saw something a lot of audiences did, but for an episode that

909
01:16:19,400 --> 01:16:23,640
was meant to take late night into a new era, it fundamentally fell short of what it was trying

910
01:16:23,640 --> 01:16:27,640
to do. It's funny because the whole episode is about the fact that she's breaking new ground,

911
01:16:27,640 --> 01:16:31,960
and yet bar a couple moments it all feels surprisingly interchangeable with the majority

912
01:16:31,960 --> 01:16:36,520
of her peers and competitors. Sometimes it's not just about saying, it's about being,

913
01:16:36,520 --> 01:16:40,920
and there is little debate that Lilly Singh is a person of Indian Punjabi descent raised in Canada,

914
01:16:40,920 --> 01:16:44,520
but if someone put a gun to your head and told you to prove it, you wouldn't just say you are,

915
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:49,160
or perform a rap about it, you'd show your culture and background. For the number of jokes directed

916
01:16:49,160 --> 01:16:53,320
at white people's expense, it still almost felt catered to white people who were comfortable

917
01:16:53,320 --> 01:16:57,320
laughing at their failure to understand other cultures, but not comfortable in trying to

918
01:16:57,320 --> 01:17:01,400
actually understand them. For a show that should have been directed towards a slightly younger

919
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:05,320
audience who are far more engaged in that sort of discourse, particularly with the multicultural

920
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:10,680
aspect of online spaces, it felt like they didn't have a fundamental comprehension or respect for a

921
01:17:10,680 --> 01:17:21,960
fair few of their target viewers. And yet, whereas the first episode could have flown under the

922
01:17:21,960 --> 01:17:25,880
radar and never been spoken about again, many descended on the show to critique,

923
01:17:25,880 --> 01:17:30,440
criticise, and deride Lilly Singh for said failings. And as noted, the YouTube algorithm

924
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:34,440
favoured these clips as they received the most attention, regardless of whether it was positive

925
01:17:34,440 --> 01:17:38,840
or negative. Modern YouTube comedians and commentators similarly chimed into the matter

926
01:17:38,840 --> 01:17:42,520
that was one of their own trying to fly the coop, yet struggling to spread their wings.

927
01:17:42,520 --> 01:17:48,280
But then the second episode aired, and the third, and the fourth, and the fifth, and the rest, yet,

928
01:17:48,280 --> 01:17:53,080
in the next couple months people still almost seemed to solely focus on the first few episodes,

929
01:17:53,080 --> 01:17:58,280
or just the first episode exclusively. Now Lilly didn't exactly help by making indirect responses

930
01:17:58,360 --> 01:18:01,160
to these videos which showed that she hadn't really watched any of them,

931
01:18:01,160 --> 01:18:04,920
which then promoted more responses to people annoyed at her response, but what if I was to

932
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:08,120
sit here and tell you that it wasn't just the second season that was fine,

933
01:18:08,120 --> 01:18:10,920
but a large majority of the remainder of the first season was fine as well.

934
01:18:18,920 --> 01:18:22,440
Maybe not. There are still a fair few issues which we've already spoken about,

935
01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:26,040
and I think they were difficult to fully address in the space of a season that was recorded with

936
01:18:26,040 --> 01:18:30,680
the intensity of a little late. To be frank, it still gets pretty dire at points.

937
01:18:30,680 --> 01:18:34,040
Nonetheless, a large majority of the season wasn't video response worthy,

938
01:18:34,040 --> 01:18:37,800
and that's why, simply put, there were very few videos covering those episodes,

939
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:41,720
and it is a fair bit of a shame that this was the case, and that many had passed judgement

940
01:18:41,720 --> 01:18:46,920
for October had even come around. It was episode one of season one, you go back and watch early

941
01:18:46,920 --> 01:18:50,440
episodes of some of the most prestigious talk shows, and they aren't the best.

942
01:18:50,440 --> 01:18:54,760
Hell, some of the greatest TV shows of all time needed a couple seasons to fully find their feet,

943
01:18:54,760 --> 01:18:58,600
it's easy for people to give books, films, and the rest a negative review because you can

944
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:03,720
experience it all at once. The episodic nature of a TV series though made that first episode

945
01:19:03,720 --> 01:19:08,200
even more important. A little late with Lilly Singh will be remembered by many for as little

946
01:19:08,200 --> 01:19:12,360
as a line. Hell, some people were still reacting to those first season monologues

947
01:19:12,360 --> 01:19:15,720
over half a year after these episodes were published onto YouTube.

948
01:19:25,320 --> 01:19:29,160
Yeah, girl, I don't know about that one.

949
01:19:29,160 --> 01:19:32,120
Let me make it clear, Lilly stoked the fire by responding the way she did,

950
01:19:32,120 --> 01:19:35,560
because it kept all the focus on these questionable writing decisions. Dismissing

951
01:19:35,560 --> 01:19:39,160
what was otherwise legitimate criticism, she probably felt like she was being unfairly

952
01:19:39,160 --> 01:19:43,400
scrutinised for cherry picked segments of a show that had already aired hours of content

953
01:19:43,400 --> 01:19:47,480
at that point. It's natural to feel defensive, particularly given the amount of effort she

954
01:19:47,480 --> 01:19:51,320
felt she had invested into the show, but the best response would have just been to speak

955
01:19:51,400 --> 01:19:55,800
to audiences and ask them to give it another chance if she really thought it was worth it.

956
01:19:55,800 --> 01:20:00,280
As noted, she alienated her own viewers through her style, and they weren't audiences that could

957
01:20:00,280 --> 01:20:04,520
never be won over, it just felt like she didn't care enough to try and do so, or she thought it

958
01:20:04,520 --> 01:20:09,080
was an effective marketing tool to win new people over, and to an extent it was I guess,

959
01:20:09,080 --> 01:20:13,480
but only as a temporary measure, and not the healthiest measure all things considered.

960
01:20:14,040 --> 01:20:18,520
As we know, at the end of the first season, NBC bragged about how A Little Late with Lilly Singh

961
01:20:18,520 --> 01:20:23,560
received the most social engagements of any debut TV show, and that was a feat of some sorts,

962
01:20:23,560 --> 01:20:28,200
but that was only due to the discourse surrounding her qualities as a late night host in the programme

963
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:33,880
itself. Problem was, as season 2 improved on season 1, there was less desire for that debate. Lilly

964
01:20:33,880 --> 01:20:37,800
probably could have accrued more short term views by inviting all her internet critics round and

965
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:41,400
debating them at her house, but instead she actually clearly took some of the feedback

966
01:20:41,400 --> 01:20:45,640
on board and transformed her set and style, and yet because the show was now actually

967
01:20:45,640 --> 01:20:50,440
good or passable at least, she couldn't rely on that debate to spur short term ratings anymore.

968
01:20:50,440 --> 01:20:53,880
The other issue was that there was approximately 8 months between the end of season 1 and the start

969
01:20:53,880 --> 01:20:58,440
of season 2, of which the show was barely mentioned to the press. This interval meant that

970
01:20:58,440 --> 01:21:02,040
by the time the start of the second season came around, many who had previously been engaged in

971
01:21:02,040 --> 01:21:05,960
the debate now were investing their attention elsewhere. When I was speaking to a few friends

972
01:21:05,960 --> 01:21:09,560
about this video, I mentioned that A Little Late with Lilly Singh was actually renewed for a second

973
01:21:09,560 --> 01:21:14,440
season, which provoked surprise from many who assumed it ended with season 1. Humans are

974
01:21:14,440 --> 01:21:19,160
interesting creatures, for a lot of online trends and subjects, we're only really interested in

975
01:21:19,160 --> 01:21:23,880
providing it with attention to a certain threshold, and then unless there is some revelation relating

976
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:28,200
to the topic, we are unlikely to revisit the matter. Lilly Singh's show could have very

977
01:21:28,200 --> 01:21:33,160
easily had a rocky start, but built up its credo over time, and by the time that it caught the

978
01:21:33,160 --> 01:21:38,440
attention of those who may not be within her core fanbase, had a pretty solid reputation.

979
01:21:38,440 --> 01:21:42,600
Unfortunately, content spreads quickly online, and it was first impressions that defined the

980
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:46,200
future of the show. You could make the argument that Lilly's show would never have improved if

981
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:51,160
she hadn't received as much criticism, which is a fair point and possibly true, but the criticism

982
01:21:51,160 --> 01:21:55,560
became bigger than the show itself. People reached their limit for discourse regarding Lilly Singh's

983
01:21:55,560 --> 01:21:59,800
late show on the basis of the first few episodes and the subsequent reactions to them, but weren't

984
01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:04,680
ready to give it another try by the time the second season came around. First impressions

985
01:22:04,680 --> 01:22:10,040
really were everything. The first episode of A Little Late with Lilly Singh was not very good,

986
01:22:10,040 --> 01:22:14,200
but I don't think it was a complete representation of what became of the show. Unfortunately,

987
01:22:14,200 --> 01:22:19,080
the nature of the internet allowed judgement to be passed before she even had the chance to improve,

988
01:22:19,080 --> 01:22:23,240
and probably doomed the show before season 2 had even been conceptualised,

989
01:22:23,240 --> 01:22:26,600
and for that it was a shame. Let's wrap this up now.

990
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:37,480
There's an episode of Spongebob Squarepants in season 4 called Mrs Puff You're Fired,

991
01:22:37,480 --> 01:22:42,600
in which Mrs Puff is dismissed due to Spongebob's continuous failure of driving tests. Mrs Puff is

992
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:46,760
replaced by a drill sergeant who surprisingly manages to teach Spongebob how to drive,

993
01:22:46,760 --> 01:22:51,240
but with one small caveat, that our Squarepanted friend has learned to do it blindfolded.

994
01:22:51,240 --> 01:22:55,560
When the test comes around once more, our special little Sponge is told that it's illegal to drive

995
01:22:55,560 --> 01:23:00,280
while blindfolded, and thus the test deteriorates very quickly, causing destruction throughout the

996
01:23:00,280 --> 01:23:05,080
entirety of Bikini Bottom until he's blinded once more by Patrick's slacks and suddenly becomes a

997
01:23:05,080 --> 01:23:09,400
competent driver again, completing the test. Unfortunately, due to the destruction that has

998
01:23:09,400 --> 01:23:14,920
been wrought, he is given a fail again, and Mrs Puff returns, much to her dismay. It's a fun little

999
01:23:14,920 --> 01:23:18,840
anecdote, but there is a lot of truth to it. Sometimes you become so accustomed to doing

1000
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:23,240
something a particular way that a change designed to help you may have the opposite effect.

1001
01:23:26,040 --> 01:23:29,240
And you see, this is where the party starts.

1002
01:23:29,240 --> 01:23:33,400
Lilly Singh procured a claim on YouTube, a platform designed to allow people to create

1003
01:23:33,400 --> 01:23:38,040
content without the large budget and production value. In many ways, Lilly proved her talent as

1004
01:23:38,040 --> 01:23:42,520
a creator who could use her experience to attract millions of recurring viewers. On the flipside,

1005
01:23:42,520 --> 01:23:47,400
Late Night TV, in spite of their extravagant ambience, had also garnered a strong online

1006
01:23:47,400 --> 01:23:52,040
following, with many hosted networks collaborating directly with YouTube to make sure their reach was

1007
01:23:52,040 --> 01:23:56,440
optimized on a website that attracted a significantly different audience. Lilly and Late

1008
01:23:56,440 --> 01:24:00,920
Night originated from very different parts of the creative world, but they ran parallel to each

1009
01:24:00,920 --> 01:24:05,320
other, and bridging that gap seemed like the natural progression for both parties, and both

1010
01:24:05,320 --> 01:24:10,200
platforms. Yet it really was the epitome of a misfire by all accounts, that will probably cause

1011
01:24:10,200 --> 01:24:14,680
a network to think twice before working with the creator again. It prompts the question we ask at

1012
01:24:14,680 --> 01:24:20,360
the start again, are YouTubers really suited to a world outside YouTube? Well, if the two seasons of

1013
01:24:20,360 --> 01:24:24,760
A Little Late demonstrate anything, it's that I don't think the potential wasn't there, it's just

1014
01:24:24,760 --> 01:24:30,120
Hollywood is struggling to understand YouTubers. NBC had said they intended to turn the time slot

1015
01:24:30,120 --> 01:24:34,440
into more of a creative playground primed for the digital era, but I don't think anyone was

1016
01:24:34,440 --> 01:24:39,000
committed enough to question what that really meant. From their perspective, it seemed to imply

1017
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:43,240
an integration of sly winks to YouTube, but without the proper understanding of why they

1018
01:24:43,240 --> 01:24:47,640
worked on the platform in the first place. Lilly Singh's Late Night show often tried to foster

1019
01:24:47,640 --> 01:24:52,200
direct fan support, rather than necessarily marketing it as a separate entity from the mind

1020
01:24:52,200 --> 01:24:57,000
of Lilly Singh. It's a strange decision because as noted, by that point she partly left YouTube

1021
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:02,280
behind. This is a problem with a lot of YouTuber based media outside of YouTube, it aids viewers

1022
01:25:02,280 --> 01:25:07,000
who have very little familiarity with your content as a whole, yet often doesn't reach as much of

1023
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:11,560
your fanbase who are primarily based on YouTube. Lilly Singh's YouTube content reached all four

1024
01:25:11,560 --> 01:25:15,880
corners of the globe, something that very few Late Night shows can successfully do. Whenever

1025
01:25:15,880 --> 01:25:19,720
YouTubers do this, it feels like studios are more interested in cashing in off their already

1026
01:25:19,720 --> 01:25:23,400
established social media presence, rather than actually considering what made them popular in

1027
01:25:23,400 --> 01:25:27,240
the first place. Comedy on YouTube had largely moved on from Lilly's style, and although the

1028
01:25:27,240 --> 01:25:31,320
show had potential, it had to mature with the viewers. There was definitely an attempt to do so,

1029
01:25:31,320 --> 01:25:34,840
but it more or less consisted of putting Lilly in a colourful suit and making her do stand-up

1030
01:25:34,840 --> 01:25:39,880
in front of a live TV audience instead of actually playing into her well-documented strengths. She

1031
01:25:39,880 --> 01:25:44,440
was not a stand-up comedian, nor did she wear suits really, she thrived on the spontaneous,

1032
01:25:44,440 --> 01:25:48,680
the mess, the chaos, and watching her try to perform within the confines of that first season

1033
01:25:48,680 --> 01:25:52,600
of Late Night sometimes felt like watching a person trying to break out of a straitjacket.

1034
01:25:52,600 --> 01:25:56,680
Lilly had all these resources at her feet, and many probably thought it should have bolstered

1035
01:25:56,680 --> 01:26:00,840
her comedy, but it's not how she learned, nor what she was accustomed to. Just because something

1036
01:26:00,840 --> 01:26:05,480
should make it easier, doesn't mean it will make it easier. Sometimes people are used to the lack

1037
01:26:05,480 --> 01:26:10,200
of direction because they feel they know themselves best. Combine that with an absolutely brutal

1038
01:26:10,200 --> 01:26:14,680
recording schedule, and some ill-timed responses from Lilly herself, and for many the first season

1039
01:26:14,680 --> 01:26:20,040
was dead on arrival, and not worth resuscitating. But then season two happened.

1040
01:26:20,440 --> 01:26:23,240
Sometimes you gotta do things to fulfil your vision, and just like make it happen,

1041
01:26:23,240 --> 01:26:27,480
that's what today is. Today is just living our dream. We're just living, we're just,

1042
01:26:27,480 --> 01:26:32,040
Chris, we're just living our dream today. Not if you're with me. Now not the camera.

1043
01:26:34,200 --> 01:26:38,600
And even if not everyone enjoyed it, it gave Lilly the breathing room to prove her ability

1044
01:26:38,600 --> 01:26:42,520
in a space where many had already written her off. What would have made recording far more

1045
01:26:42,520 --> 01:26:46,600
challenging for a variety of established talk show hosts took Lilly back to where she was most

1046
01:26:46,600 --> 01:26:50,280
comfortable, and her second season seemed to operate far more smoothly than the first,

1047
01:26:50,280 --> 01:26:54,440
with guests, viewers, and Lilly herself all appearing to have much more fun than the season

1048
01:26:54,440 --> 01:26:58,760
that had come before. Alas, it had come a little too late for Lilly Singh. The damage had already

1049
01:26:58,760 --> 01:27:02,200
been done when the first season hit the screens, and many prospective viewers had switched over

1050
01:27:02,200 --> 01:27:05,880
the channel, with others receiving their impressions from content creators which directed

1051
01:27:05,880 --> 01:27:10,440
online opinion. Nonetheless, if the result of the second season is just a piece of media that she

1052
01:27:10,440 --> 01:27:14,680
and her audience can watch back and enjoy, then maybe it's done the trick. I don't think Lilly

1053
01:27:14,680 --> 01:27:19,160
laments it too much, and overall it has brought her far more opportunities than it has cost her,

1054
01:27:19,160 --> 01:27:23,240
and if that's the result of any piece of media then you can consider it a victory.

1055
01:27:23,240 --> 01:27:26,200
With that said, it's obviously a shame that the show couldn't be something more,

1056
01:27:26,200 --> 01:27:30,120
couldn't be the trailblazing shot in the arm that late night TV desperately needed.

1057
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:34,120
Ratings are still struggling, and it's not like there isn't a reality where I don't see shows

1058
01:27:34,120 --> 01:27:38,280
that could resemble Lilly's accruing and large viewership. I do think YouTube and Late Night

1059
01:27:38,280 --> 01:27:42,680
could have a close relationship, I think there's more opportunity in using a creator's personality

1060
01:27:42,680 --> 01:27:46,520
and appeal in these spaces than there are in film and TV, but you have to understand that a lot of

1061
01:27:46,520 --> 01:27:51,000
people don't just tune in for a name, you need to work with that personality and identity as well.

1062
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:55,400
Perhaps a little late with Lilly Singh's second season, even if it didn't return the numbers to

1063
01:27:55,400 --> 01:28:01,320
maintain its own survival, could provide a few ideas for agonising TV executives all over Hollywood.

1064
01:28:01,320 --> 01:28:09,000
Lilly Singh- I'm a big believer that if you have blessings, you don't build a higher fence, you build a longer table.

1065
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:15,400
I quite like Lilly Singh, not in the haha I think she's hilarious way, or even the yas queen slayer way.

1066
01:28:15,400 --> 01:28:19,320
I don't think she always knew how to respond to people discussing her show, and I think she interpreted

1067
01:28:19,320 --> 01:28:24,040
a lot of the criticism as bad faith, when really they probably had a point. I think she was part of

1068
01:28:24,040 --> 01:28:29,000
the why can't everyone just get a long generation, and a lot of newer creators on YouTube just didn't

1069
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:33,480
subscribe to that, which is why I think they clashed heads. I don't find her particularly funny, but

1070
01:28:33,480 --> 01:28:38,120
then again I never really watched her content, and to be honest, neither did a lot of the people that

1071
01:28:38,120 --> 01:28:42,600
roasted her. However, I don't think it's hard to see why people like her around, and enjoy her presence.

1072
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:46,040
She always seems to convey herself as someone who knows how to communicate with the world, and

1073
01:28:46,040 --> 01:28:51,000
develop a strong, unique chemistry with those that were subject to her attention. Unlike other certain

1074
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:56,200
hosts, you didn't need to manufacture a warm aesthetic, because Lilly was a naturally warm person,

1075
01:28:56,200 --> 01:29:00,440
and you sometimes wonder if the studio has actually ever dealt with someone like that, who didn't need

1076
01:29:00,440 --> 01:29:04,920
the prompts to have conversations. She didn't need to be told what to be interested about, because she

1077
01:29:04,920 --> 01:29:09,480
was legitimately interested in things other than herself. She didn't need to be put inside the late

1078
01:29:09,480 --> 01:29:12,360
night mould, she was there to break it.

1079
01:29:35,640 --> 01:29:41,160
Alas, maybe a little late with Lilly seeing it wasn't meant to be, and it was cursed from the start.

1080
01:29:41,160 --> 01:29:45,880
Maybe there was a right way to do it, but it just didn't happen, with networks suddenly failing to

1081
01:29:45,880 --> 01:29:50,760
promote its longevity. It's hard for anyone to say if there was a way to turn it into the sensation

1082
01:29:50,760 --> 01:29:56,040
it was imagined by some to be, but for a talk show, it did provide everyone with something to talk about,

1083
01:29:56,040 --> 01:30:03,160
laugh about, satire, praise, criticise, debate, respond to, engage, and for some, to watch, support,

1084
01:30:03,160 --> 01:30:07,400
find comfort in, perhaps find themselves a bit closer to a creator they looked up to.

1085
01:30:07,400 --> 01:30:13,160
Even if it didn't turn the late night TV world upside down, and usher in a new era of YouTuber

1086
01:30:13,160 --> 01:30:18,680
led shows, it still gave something to YouTube, and maybe that's all it needed to do.

1087
01:30:20,920 --> 01:30:22,680
Thank you, and goodnight.

1088
01:30:25,080 --> 01:30:30,200
So yeah, that was the video, I hope you all enjoyed it, I hope you all got something from it,

1089
01:30:30,200 --> 01:30:35,080
and hopefully it inspires some productive discussion. I want to thank the editors,

1090
01:30:35,080 --> 01:30:39,960
they've once again done a fantastic job, as always their credits will be in the pinned comments.

1091
01:30:39,960 --> 01:30:45,160
I want to thank the post editors, Grumpy and Vic Grimes, fantastic work as always,

1092
01:30:45,160 --> 01:30:49,880
they really came through after the original post editor had to drop out due to a very very sad

1093
01:30:49,880 --> 01:30:56,200
situation, and sending my love to him as well, you know who you are. Thanks again for the background

1094
01:30:56,200 --> 01:31:01,320
music as well, I assume that'll be Linuski, I'm not sure yet, but he always does a great job.

1095
01:31:01,320 --> 01:31:06,920
Thumbnail as always, Starfo, fantastic work. I'd like to thank my Patrons, $10 patrons on the

1096
01:31:06,920 --> 01:31:12,520
screen now, but I got some $50 patrons to thank as well, thank you again so much guys, Seri, Tish,

1097
01:31:12,520 --> 01:31:18,040
Esther Bedoya, Hypercube, and Laura Woodward. I really appreciate the support and the belief it

1098
01:31:18,040 --> 01:31:23,400
clearly represents, so thank you for that. Artists, if your artwork appears in this video,

1099
01:31:23,400 --> 01:31:26,920
the credits should be in the pinned comment, but if it's not, just let me know and I'll add it.

1100
01:31:26,920 --> 01:31:32,360
I also need to thank the sponsor, Scentbird, as you can tell, it's very hard for me to contain

1101
01:31:32,360 --> 01:31:37,800
my enthusiasm. I don't really have much else to add, but I once again hope you enjoyed the video,

1102
01:31:37,800 --> 01:31:40,680
and if you're still here, thank you for listening to me ramble.

1103
01:31:40,680 --> 01:31:43,960
I'm The Right Opinion, and I will see you in the next one.
