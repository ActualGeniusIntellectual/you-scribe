0	19800	Hello ladies and gentlemen, welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time,
19800	27100	and boy oh boy, is this a video I've been waiting to do for a while. In fact, I had originally planned to do this as some 500k subscriber special,
27100	32980	but alas, time flies, and so many events occurred at that time that it was impossible to find a place for this video,
32980	39420	but now everything's opened up a tiny bit more, I'm feeling more comfortable to take the time to talk about, well, a lot.
39420	44140	At one point, I'd also planned to make this a New Year's kinda thing, kinda resolution sort of vibe,
44140	49500	but knowing how long these videos take, I think there's a reasonable chance that it's closer to next year by the time this video's out.
49500	55100	That is, of course, a hilarious joke, though knowing how long it takes on my videos, you may well have believed it.
55140	60340	Obviously, this is a minor instalment in the Troe catalogue, but I still think it's a necessary one.
60340	66460	As implied in the title, there will be a Q&A that will hopefully provide you with a little more insight on the man behind the Avatar.
66460	73700	I also have a fair few announcements to make, but first of all, I would love to spend some time thanking those who have helped me on this rather chaotic journey.
73700	78900	The main party who has probably played the most prominent part in this advancement are of course the editors,
78900	83620	now as you probably know, I have a fair few editors, so I'll be leaving them all in the pinned comment,
83660	90620	however, I do want to give a few special mentions to individuals who have gone above and beyond the Call of Duty in the past few months in particular.
90620	93980	It's hard to know exactly who to start with, but I'd like to mention Peter Day.
93980	100220	He has worked around the clock with some of the toughest edits and post-edits, when other people haven't been quite able to follow through,
100220	105140	he has been on call every time, no exception. The dude is a superhuman, and I can't understate that.
105140	110180	We're going to be working on a new channel project together ourselves, and I can't wait to get that off the ground.
110180	116340	I'd also like to give thanks to anyone who has helped post-edit on a regular basis, most notably to Linuski and Mullenax.
116340	122180	If you've ever heard the Danganronpa music in the background, then I can tell you that was the product of Mullenax's magic.
122180	127540	They're both also really talented editors on their own terms with incredibly distinctive styles, I love what they do,
127540	133380	and all three of these beautiful people have been working with me for over a year, and I hope that we can continue working through this one.
133380	138180	I'd also like to give a mention to people who have consistently delivered high quality edits on a regular basis.
138180	142340	A large majority of my editors have, and we've all worked on improving throughout the year.
142340	146260	It's good to slowly work to push the bar higher, and I hope I can match their quality.
146260	152260	I also want to give a big shoutout to my Discord server, the admins, and the head admin, and furry, Derumasis.
152260	157620	Many of you probably don't know that when I was starting off on YouTube, I ran Colossalist's crazy server for a bit,
157620	163140	and it was an absolute nightmare. Discord has obviously made it easier to manage certain elements since then,
163140	167460	but it's still a challenge, and when I was working on it, it was always tough to make a decision that I felt
167460	173860	would represent the Discord owner in question, so if you see him, tell him he does an alright job, and that he's a furry.
173860	178260	He loves to be told that he's a furry, guys. I'd also like to thank my Patreons for their support,
178260	182180	it gives me a bit more security when talking about topics that may be sensitive.
182180	188180	Obviously, I'm always paying money to others for their work on my videos, and so their contributions are a lifeline.
188180	195700	I don't really plug my Patreon too much, I only mention it right at the end of the videos, and a lot of people tend to click off before that point.
195700	200020	So the fact that some actively seek it out and involve themselves like that does mean a lot to me.
200020	207300	I want to give a special mention to my $50 Patreons, Sumhala Baloo, Nico Deschamps, Caroline, Cole P Hennessy, and Hypercube,
207300	213780	they are all doing a fantastic job, thank you so much, guys. Sumhala Baloo has been supporting for over a year now,
213780	219620	which I just think is incredible, and I'd also like to give an extra special mention to Brandon Stanton,
219620	226180	Christopher Kraz, and Be More Cool J, my $100 Patreons. Brandon, who once again has been donating for over a year now.
226180	232020	I actually have never spoken to him, but if you are watching from afar, know that your generosity does not go unnoticed.
232020	237540	I want to thank all my friends, YouTube and non-YouTube, you need both to maintain some semblance of sanity.
237540	242180	It's been really cool building public bonds with fantastic creators like Primink and J Aubrey,
242180	246740	which is the only time I plan on pronouncing his name correctly, it will be J Aubrey for eternity.
246740	254260	I will be starting a podcast with our good friend Jon soon, and I'll leave a link in the pinned comment if you want to go and subscribe to it.
254260	259620	I know a lot of people were anticipating a podcast with Primink too, and as much as I want that, we both really do,
259620	264340	because our banter is uncontested. Unfortunately, he's got a few other issues to deal with first,
264340	269300	but I'm confident we'll make it a real thing eventually. Beyond that, I have a load of fellow creators to thank,
269300	275620	IHE, Colossal, anyone who got me started and promoted my work, and on top of that, I want to thank everyone
275620	280580	I've had the pleasure of meeting at events, VidCon, Insomnia, all of them are really enlightening,
280580	285300	and a reminder that at the end of the day, we're all human, even if we're behind a screen most of the time.
285300	290020	Any viewers I've met at those events too, it's really cool, I actually do want to do more meetups,
290020	296420	but I find them a bit daunting, I had a couple experiences that put me off, but overall, they've been really positive ones that I have had.
296420	300740	So yeah, I've mentioned a lot of people, however, most importantly, I have you guys to thank,
300740	305380	I want to thank you for your continued support, and I hope I can represent that in the best way possible.
305380	309300	It's admittedly been an interesting year, and I'll go into more detail about that soon,
309300	314740	but it's good to have some people who will pull you through regardless. Without stroking your ego too much,
314740	318820	it's good to have an audience who are pretty constructive in how they respond, how they reach out,
318820	324020	and even how they deliver criticism. I'm not perfect, and we'll probably talk about that more in the Q&A section,
324020	328900	but someone messaged me saying that they really appreciated that in spite of my rather pessimistic outlook,
328900	334740	I try and see the best in people. I don't think that would be possible without people around me who take a similar philosophy,
334740	340420	I am truly grateful for that. For now, I think it's best we enter the Q&A section, because some of you people
340420	346340	really want to find out more about me, to be honest. Well, there's a lot to discuss, so I suggest we get into it.
354500	359220	Alright, so before we get into this, I'll make it clear that if you haven't watched my last Q&A,
359220	363540	I don't tend to go from question to question, I tend to try and give overarching answers that
363540	367460	hopefully satisfy general points of interest, though of course I'll show some examples of
367460	371780	questions so it doesn't look like I'm conducting an interview of myself. I'd also stress that there
371780	376420	are some things that I may not talk about again, because I already spoke about them in my previous
376420	381300	Q&A, and I don't want to be merely repeating myself, though I probably will. There's still a lot to talk
381300	386340	about though, a lot, because last time I made one of these, I wasn't too detailed. Today I'll be
386340	390740	showing a bit more, and maybe throwing a little shade, so I hope you do enjoy that.
390740	397300	I guess one of the questions that I receive a lot is why I started, and that's a complex story, which,
397300	401860	if asked before, I probably didn't go into too much depth, I probably said something like,
401860	410020	oh I was bored, which isn't entirely true, so let's do that now. We go back to 2015, I believe.
410020	415460	I decided to take a gap year, mainly because I wasn't quite confident that I knew exactly what I
415460	419700	wanted to do at university. Initially, I had applied for script writing, but I began to have
419700	424020	cold feet that it would be a very difficult industry to infiltrate, so instead of taking any
424020	428340	of the offers I had received, I decided to hang back and make some new applications.
428340	433060	After a bit of rumination, I found a course at a prestigious university that suited my interest,
433060	438900	and I decided to apply for that. I also had various backup offers, but once I set my mind
438900	444740	on a goal, it's hard to turn it onto anything else. Nonetheless, it was a painful process,
444740	449300	there are a few stages, and it ends in a final interview stage at the actual college,
449300	454340	so obviously I had to submit my application, and then I had to take this test, which I vigorously
454340	458660	revised for with one of my close friends, shout out to Cheyenne, you're a legend. That went well,
458660	463460	and then I was invited to the university. Now, at this point, I probably had a false sense of
463460	468740	security, because I'm quite good at interviews generally speaking, or at least I thought I was,
468740	473140	and when I was there, I had such an incredible time, they make it an incredible time, they hold
473140	477460	these events, make you feel part of their family. Looking back on it, they kinda led me on.
477460	482980	Because of that, I began to envision my future a bit too keenly, I had an idea in my mind of where
482980	488900	I wanted to be, I had my mind on the university experience, and I should've managed my expectations
488900	493860	better, because it didn't work out, and I think when I found out was one of the first times that
493860	499780	I just felt this emotional black hole swallowing me. When I received the test results, which you
499780	504180	receive after their verdict for some reason, because they were pretty high, I decided to make
504180	509620	an inquiry about what they felt I could've done better, and after just a month, they gave me this
509620	514500	email. The assessing tutors thought you gave a good interview, but unfortunately, given the
514500	520260	competition for places, they felt there were stronger candidates. Oh, really, I thought the
520260	528180	tutors were purposely giving places to weaker candidates. I felt insulted. I had waited almost
528180	534740	a month to basically be told, you lost because other people beat you. This was 2016 by the way,
534740	540420	I should probably clarify that, we are now into 2016, and this kinda flipped my mentality on its
540420	545540	head at the time, because I've always sought out the idea that I do need to improve, right the
545540	552820	wrongs, and yet, I gave this so much of my all, and received such a vague answer regarding something
552820	560260	I cared about so much. I felt like I didn't know what to do better, and neither did they, and I
560260	565620	didn't like that feeling, and because of that, I felt like no matter how much I gave, I would never
565620	571540	be good enough in other people's eyes, or my own eyes. I was having a rough time in life with
571540	577300	General, I felt like a failure, I was an emotional mess who probably flipped out a few times, because
578100	583140	plans in my head had fallen apart, I had a good family providing me security, but I didn't have much
583140	588500	money, and I always wanted to do something that could change my life. Other career paths were cool,
588500	593300	but they were also pretty risky, YouTube seemed like that medium that could work out with a small
593300	598260	initial investment, and the idea you could make gradual progress while continuing to support
598260	604580	yourself. A few of my friends were doing YouTube at the time as well, Ollie, Ram, Isaac, you know who
604580	609220	you are, and they seemed to be having a good time, so I thought it'd be an interesting thing to throw
609220	613300	myself into. I think at that point I needed something to take my mind away from various
613300	617780	insecurities, and I also wanted to prove to myself that I was good enough. I'm a perfectionist, and
617780	623060	for multiple reasons that I'm probably going to go into eventually, my life had felt less than
623060	627860	perfect. I was inspired by creators such as I Hate Everything, Odessa Buckley, and music critics such
627860	632740	as Todd in the Shadows. I based the persona on a rather British stereotype due to my demeanor, and
632740	638580	of course the accent, which yes, it is real, I thought it was good branding at least. Obviously,
638580	643380	when I started, I made quite different content to what I do today. A lot of the first videos focused
643380	648500	on political commentary, quite casual but stinging criticism of the then incumbent Conservative Party
648500	653220	and many of their policies, politics was something that I was highly passionate about at the time,
653220	657780	and therefore I thought maybe mixing the genre of politics with short form commentary could work
657780	663300	out. With the help from my friends Isaac, also now known as Viri, and Jack, I managed to put
663300	668260	out a decent amount of content, however I wasn't particularly invested in the channel at the time.
668260	673620	I just wanted to make some videos where I chatted about stuff. I still had a lot of friends, and we
673620	678580	partook in various activities, for example we even went to Rome on the back of a few hundred quid that
678580	683380	each of us had, and that was fun. There are vlogs of that trip online still, I'll leave them in the
683380	688740	pinned comment if you wanna see some footage of me prior to this fun little hobby. For the first few
688740	694020	months I didn't really see YouTube beyond that hobby that would maybe blow up if I was fortunate.
694020	699140	That all changed when I started university, which is strange because I was expecting university to
699140	704420	be the end of my YouTube career. I went to Amsterdam to keep it vague, and it didn't go well,
704420	711700	it wasn't good on the basis that it was already a disappointing result in my head, and this was also
711700	716980	in the wake of the very significant Brexit vote, and a fair few people at the college had taken it
716980	720900	very personally. Now, I'm not particularly enthusiastic about Britain's withdrawal from
720900	725460	the European Union, but if you have watched my old videos, in spite of my generally left political
725460	730420	persuasion, you'll know that I'm a firm critic of the European Union, much of their procedure and
730420	736740	structure. Go back half a century, and a lot of Eurosceptics were on the left, but by 2016 it was
736740	742020	clearly associated with right-wing ideology, and I think a lot of people jumped to conclusions about
742020	748660	my own views, and people were emotional. That sort of stuff happens. I'm not mad about it, but the
748660	754100	consequences were not great, people saw a few critical Facebook posts and it spiralled. I tried
754100	758740	to shake it off at the start of the year by really involving myself in various activities, but I think
758740	763940	I gave up after a month and just receded onto the online world. Probably one of the most defining
763940	768820	experiences was in the second week. I remember I had a few new friends around to watch a film on
768820	774100	my TV, and I went to grab my laundry. I always did my laundry really late at night, because I hated
774100	778180	taking my laundry there and finding all the washing machines occupied. Some other British
778180	782580	freshman who had clearly been drinking too much with his friends ended up swearing at me in the
782580	788660	street, and although I returned verbal fire, which was foolish, I felt very shaken. And following that,
788660	793060	I felt always some distance from other students. I'm not gonna make myself out to be some kind of
793140	797940	victim, but knowing you're being subjected to differing levels of judgement from people,
797940	802420	and never knowing what they think about you, and knowing that people are talking about you behind
802420	807940	your back, is isolating. At that point, I became more involved with the online world again. I'd
807940	813380	work on ColossusCrazy's Discord server, I'd work on more videos, I think I aimed to get three a week
813380	818340	at some point. A lot of them are videos that frankly I don't really remember, nor do I really
818340	822900	want to remember, though I might have a more cynical memory than that which is warranted.
822900	827460	However, as you know, that's not the content that I was making today. Let's talk about that then,
827460	828580	and how I got here.
831460	837540	So that's the question, how did I end up making what I do today from my very humble beginnings,
837540	841700	and the evolution that has occurred, because you know, for a long time, I had been making
841700	846740	short form videos relating to political topics, so I guess we have to tackle two more things.
846740	851300	Why did I make my videos longer, and why do I not cover political topics anymore?
851300	857060	Let's talk about my political evolution first, because my political journey was much like an arc.
857060	861620	I spoke about this in my previous Q&A, but once again we have more time for the Tro-Law than
861620	867380	previous, so since I've left university, I've felt less motivation to conceal my feelings and
867380	872100	the drama that occurred. The first couple years had pushed me in various directions politically,
872100	877060	the exposure to rather hostile individuals in Amsterdam definitely made me bitter to a cause
877060	881860	that I previously identified with, and it had made me more outspoken in a way. It was a late
881860	887060	stage rebellious period in my mind, and I didn't stay at Amsterdam, which is very important.
887860	893060	That's a fun little story actually. In February 2017, I suffered from probably one of the worst
893060	897700	illnesses that I'd ever had in my life. They never actually diagnosed it, but my temperature
897700	903540	was soaring, I had jaundice, it was really nasty stuff, I lost a month of class, and I even went
903540	908820	home for treatment. Because of this, I missed a significant number of courses, five if I recall.
908820	913540	Now, for four of the courses, the tutors were highly accommodating, and allowed me to partake
913540	917940	in any of the assessments that I had missed. However, there was this one class, of which I
917940	923140	didn't have the best experience anyway, the tutor wasn't fond of my outspoken nature, and the
923140	928020	feeling was mutual. I had missed the last week of lessons, which of course, wouldn't normally be a
928020	934100	big deal, but because it was an intensive course, she insisted that I had to retake the whole 23
934100	939620	lessons, an idea that I did not find palace ball, considering I'd been there for 19 lessons.
939620	944740	So I appealed to the relevant academic board, who decided that actually, they wanted to support the
944740	948900	tutor's decision. I assumed at first they were ill informed, and sent them all the relevant
948900	954100	documentation, doctor's assessments, contributions, I even met with them, I offered compromises, even
954100	958180	offering to retake the part of the course that I had missed. Even though I'd done the written
958180	964180	assessment, the exam, and worked on part of the group project, they insisted that I had to do the
964180	969060	whole thing again. In the end, I took it to the higher appeals board, and although I won the case
969060	974340	against them on that level, I had attended a tribunal where I had to represent myself against
974340	981060	my own academic board, and that was surreal, and it probably has shaped why I have very little trust
981060	985940	in authority. It was undoubtedly the most stressful experience of my life, and at the time, it led to a
985940	991140	lot of specific resentment towards the stereotype of what the typical liberal arts represented,
991140	996020	leading to a lot of videos that probably served as the antithesis to the philosophy of their
996020	1001540	attitude. In hindsight, that wasn't the right way to deal with it, and the lesson that I should have
1001540	1007540	learned was much broader than that. You can't rely on others to do the right thing for you, but in 2017,
1007540	1012580	I was definitely at my most political, and it was not in the right way, I was ideologically channeling
1012580	1017540	frustrations against an issue that was beyond ideology, which is why a lot of those videos just
1017540	1022100	aren't up anymore. After this mess, I made a conscious decision to move to a different university.
1022100	1027140	Now, I really didn't want to do this on principle, because I didn't want to lose the academic progress
1027140	1031460	that I made throughout that year, but fortunately, the University of Groningen, also in the Netherlands,
1031460	1036100	offered a straight transfer that allowed me to start in my second year, and that was a very
1036100	1040900	different environment, which completely dissipated many of my frustrations that I had at the previous
1040900	1045620	university. Now, let me make it clear, this wasn't without its problems, I had some issues when I
1045620	1051220	started, but they weren't social. I go along with people fine, even though at that point, I dedicated
1051220	1056180	a significant amount of time to my YouTube grind. I got drunk on many Saturday nights, made a fair
1056180	1061220	few friends, big shout out to Sush You Mad Lad, if you're watching this. It took a few months,
1061220	1066340	probably until January, February, but my opinion on these stereotypes in my head really began to
1066340	1070740	soften, and I tried to diversify my content a little. I remember making a critical video on
1070740	1076260	White Boy by Tom McDonald, and that just got absolutely swarmed with a mix of McDonald fans,
1076260	1081380	and actual alt writers who, for some reason, weren't the nicest. You know they say there's always
1081380	1085940	one video where you gotta have a negative like to dislike ratio, that was it. At that point,
1085940	1090260	I had a policy of replying to nearly every comment that was made on my videos, but I have to admit
1090260	1094900	my patience began to wither after that one. I realised that my brand of what I viewed as a
1094900	1099140	gender-driven activism probably wasn't the healthiest for me, and that it often pushed
1099140	1104420	me to one side of the debate, when really I wanted to think myself as quite an open-minded person.
1104420	1109780	I think what I realised is that I was still politically naive to a lot of ideas that I had,
1109780	1114900	where I stood, and there was this part of me that I wanted to figure that out, and that a YouTube
1114900	1119540	channel where you post all your thoughts with some degree of confidence and conviction
1119540	1124500	probably wasn't the best if you had changed your mind in a few years. However, I still wanted to
1124500	1129300	make content that could involve me looking at situations, applying various levels of logic and
1129300	1134340	reasoning, something that would challenge me, and at the time a lot of my friends were involved in
1134340	1139460	commentary. In spite of my political narratives, I'd never really fit into any political clique,
1139460	1143780	and no one had ever really invited me, which was fine, but because of that, the only reason that
1143780	1148660	I made those videos was because of my own personal interest, my own attachment, I didn't
1148660	1154980	have an obligation to anyone else. At around that time, early 2018, I also attended an Insomnia
1154980	1160100	gaming festival, which was the first event that I attended as a YouTuber, and it inspired me to take
1160100	1165700	the leap into commentary. However, I was aware of one thing, that there were a lot of commentators,
1165700	1170500	and I'd made commentary videos in the past, and they hadn't done much. The most successful video
1170500	1175460	I had made at that point was a video called Matt Hoss Could Win, and that seemed more like a fluke
1175460	1179860	than anything else. So I realised that I had to do something unique, I had to leave an impact with
1179860	1184980	my content, so I took a look at my resources and what I had going for me, I had relatively strong
1184980	1189460	community standing, a persistent determination, some experience in writing, and a strong
1189460	1194260	relationship with some very talented editors. So I thought, well, let's put it all together,
1194260	1199220	make longer videos, videos with a more personal style, something that will set me apart in what
1199220	1204580	I'm doing, and yet maintain a decent upload schedule, and so I began making videos in that
1204580	1208820	style. This wasn't without its problems, and it still isn't, there are obviously going to be some
1208820	1213620	inconsistencies in the visuals, and even though there is consistency, some people just can't get
1213620	1218980	into that style of video, and I can't blame people if they don't like that approach. For me though,
1218980	1223780	what I think is most important is that feeling of progress, that sentiment that I hope with regards
1223780	1228260	to quality, my videos are moving forward. Obviously, that's subjective to an extent,
1228260	1232180	but if you go back to my earlier videos in this format, and compare them with the ones that I'm
1232180	1236660	doing today, I hope that there is some visible difference, and hopefully one that is for the
1236660	1242340	better, but as said, it hasn't been without its challenges. Let's talk about that a bit more.
1246500	1251060	One of the most significant burning questions that I've received from people is about the mental
1251060	1256340	effect that such content has had on me, and it's a good question, one that is kind of difficult
1256340	1262180	to respond to, but I'll do my best. It's not been great, no one said this stuff would be easy,
1262180	1267700	and I embrace the challenge, but it's a large burden, and I guess this ties into the questions
1267700	1272980	that I receive about maintaining some emotional distance from the topics. I've even had a few
1272980	1278260	people ask me in the past if I'm a sociopath, which I'm definitely not, but I understand why
1278260	1282660	someone may think that. To enter the topics with the level of emotional distance that I often do
1282660	1286980	is difficult. I think trying to untie your personal feelings from these issues is something
1286980	1291540	that many find too much of a challenge to do themselves, and it's a challenge that I don't
1291540	1297380	always successfully traverse myself, but I guess I was set up for it in a way. When I was growing up,
1297380	1302420	I was an emotional person, extremely emotional, I was very volatile, and my moods often swung from
1302420	1306420	one pole to the other. I've always been very perceptive, so when I felt someone was being
1306420	1311940	unfair, unreasonable, or vindictive, I was prone to being quite abruptly hostile. However, I came
1311940	1316020	to realise that many people wouldn't often come around to your point of view through such an
1316020	1321460	attitude, and that often you had to use other more restrained techniques. When I was around 12, I had
1321460	1325300	anger management therapy, and this definitely improved me, and although I was still prone to
1325300	1330980	making emotionally based and often rash decisions, in the next few years I continued to work on myself.
1332100	1336260	Life was pretty good through a majority of my teenage years, but I think my gap year combined
1336260	1341780	with my first year of university really fractured my mentality. There were a lot of times where I
1341780	1346660	probably got too emotionally invested in my own expectations, which led to disappointment, and I
1346660	1352420	think that sort of continuous cycle wears you down, and eventually my body just said no to heavy
1352420	1357780	emotional investment, and excitement, and looking forward to things. And this isn't to say I don't
1357780	1363060	still feel things because I do, but I often get this very weird dynamic where I experience more
1363060	1369140	physical emotional reactions than what I feel inside. For example, sometimes I'll do karaoke,
1369140	1374100	and I know it makes me very nervous, and although I won't feel nervous in my head, I'll experience
1374100	1379860	the most terrible tremors. It feels like there's some emotional disconnect between how I feel and
1379860	1385140	how my head tells me to feel, and this I think has allowed me to look at drama from a relatively
1385140	1391940	distant standpoint while still integrating some emotionally based reasoning. It's a blessing and
1391940	1396660	a curse. However, with that said, when I started this new style and began obtaining success,
1396660	1400820	I definitely still experienced an excitement for the first eight months or so. When a video
1400820	1406340	performed well, I got a rush from what I was experiencing. However, after a while, that began
1406340	1410100	to wear off, maybe due to the fact that you gradually become desensitized to these things
1410100	1414660	after they happen on a regular basis, but also likely because I was aware that with more people
1414660	1419460	watching you, there's a greater responsibility to deliver content that represents the brand that
1419460	1423700	a lot of you guys watch me for. As you grow your channel, there's more to lose on a mistake,
1423700	1428500	it's a lot of pressure to deliver that content all the time, and on occasion I've failed to
1428500	1433300	make it to a standard that I'll be happy with and it'll play on my mind. I'll go into more detail
1433300	1437540	regarding that soon, but every upload is a lot of pressure, that thought that there's been some
1437540	1441700	glitch that you didn't pick up, some comment that you made being read a different way,
1441700	1447220	some misunderstanding that you've made, and those are valid concerns because I've made all of those
1447220	1452820	mistakes in my videos. Am I paranoid? Probably, but when you're talking about drama, you're never
1452820	1457220	too far away from it. On top of that, it's a lot to emotionally restrain yourself when there's
1457220	1461940	parts of me encouraging to absolutely let loose on people who come at you. There's still a part
1461940	1465940	of me that wants to respond to everyone and everything, but once you reach a certain point,
1465940	1470100	you realise that there's a lot of realism you have to apply. I think one of the other things is that
1470100	1474580	when a lot of people become popular, they often adapt a different mindset, because when you have
1474580	1479700	so much of your life at the public's disposal, you kinda have to take a different approach to it.
1479700	1484500	For me though, I feel that it's a necessity that my content requires grounding from the eyes of the
1484500	1488900	audience, which means I can never really become particularly invested in my own success, because
1488900	1493540	I worry that it would probably inflate my ego to the point where I lose touch with the perspectives
1493540	1499140	that I want to relay in my content. Just look at the Slazo video. These are all things that cause
1499140	1503700	a strong amount of pressure, which brings me to another very popular question that people ask me,
1503700	1508740	how do these serious topics affect my mental state? And to be honest, it's difficult to describe,
1508740	1513140	because for me, although the details obviously cause a level of repulsion, there's a part of me
1513140	1517780	that is just determined to push through and make sure that the content is delivered regardless of
1517780	1522660	what I find. I guess I do feel an element that takes its toll, but I also want to talk about
1522660	1526740	these things, the really sensitive topics sometimes, such as Etika, where no one had really
1526740	1531700	said anything the way that I wanted to. I guess my philosophy has always been what doesn't kill you
1531700	1535780	makes you stronger, and although that's not exactly true, and I'll be more than happy to tell you that,
1535780	1540660	I do find that experience grants one an element of mental immunity, although I'm not sure what the
1540660	1545620	cost of that has been. One of my former friends who I even collaborated with has managed to become
1545620	1551620	popular off the Minecraft resurgence, and I couldn't be happier for him, but part of me feels like
1551620	1558900	I could have made this easier for myself, I haven't chosen the easier path. My child's
1558900	1562900	development has not been without its flaws, some people reached out to me with these problems,
1562900	1567620	some I agree with and pledge to work on, others I disagree with and accept it's probably a
1567620	1572500	difference of opinion that separates us. I think probably my greatest challenge is making sure I
1572500	1577860	provide an analysis that separates observation from my own personal opinion, even though my videos
1577860	1582500	come out after a while, I still have to be considerate of the facts around the case changing, and keep an
1582500	1588580	open mind and be sympathetic to possible conditions that may yield it. I have biases, I will probably
1588580	1594020	always have biases, I am human, but I can still do better, and I need to avoid biases like those
1594020	1598500	which state that just because circumstances dictate something is likely doesn't mean it's certain,
1598500	1603940	and I need to emphasise that, but not necessarily compromise on the criticism that I want to deliver.
1603940	1608900	An example of where I failed on that was the ProJared video, which I unlisted a while back but
1608900	1614180	never really got round to talking about why, and although I have my criticisms, I was far too harsh
1614180	1618660	and channeled too many personal frustrations about responses rather than being sympathetic to
1618660	1623940	possible explanations and circumstances. I also missed details that would've altered my perspective,
1623940	1628900	and that's not good enough, I am sorry about that. A lot of people asked if I'd make a new version of
1628900	1633860	the video, but in the end I just didn't feel happy trying to redo it, I have very conflicted feelings
1633860	1639460	on the whole situation and his video. It wouldn't feel right to me picking through the topic with
1639460	1646100	a level of distance and superiority knowing that I could've done better myself. I didn't feel
1646100	1650580	comfortable putting myself in that position at that point, so I think sometimes you have to take
1650580	1657700	the L, move on, and take it as a learning experience. Talking about moving on, we'll slide over to a new topic.
1669460	1690260	Another question that I received a lot is regarding the process I make my videos with,
1690260	1694740	how do I end up releasing these videos on a regular basis? It reminded me of a comment left
1694740	1700420	on my video that an editor sent me once, which basically said, so all you do is write an essay?
1700420	1706020	Listen mate, I wish it was that easy. Let's talk about how I make my videos. Firstly, it's picking
1706020	1710660	a topic. I have a google doc which lists all the possible topics that I could undertake. It's a
1710660	1715540	long list, a lot of people ask me if I run out of topics, and I can definitely say that's not really
1715540	1719540	a problem with me. With all these communities on YouTube, there's seldom a time when there isn't
1719540	1724020	something to talk about. I like to think that my style can always bring something new even if it's
1724020	1728340	a heavily visited topic. I think there's a lot of flexibility in what I can cover fortunately,
1728340	1732340	and that provides me with a broader range of situations to cover, so once I've picked a topic
1732340	1737860	I'll typically begin some research, and at that point a lot of people ask me how I do that. Well,
1737860	1742340	I don't do anything particularly special, I use Google, YouTube, Twitter, Advanced Search,
1742340	1747140	Web Archive, and if there are any search engines specific to a certain site then obviously I'll
1747140	1753940	use them too. I have a few secret formulas that I keep to myself, but overall it's nothing magical.
1753940	1758420	A lot of searching, lots of clicking, one link that will lead to another link, and then maybe
1758420	1762820	another link, I think it's just a case of tenacity and working through fatigue that you might
1762820	1768340	experience. The research at first though is not too heavy, I do not do it all at once. Often I'll
1768340	1773540	work in research as I do my scripts, it's like a learning process for me as much as it is with
1773540	1778740	my audience, so you can see the evolution of my ideas and opinions throughout the video.
1779300	1784180	Some people ask if my opinions evolve too much during the research of a topic, and generally
1784180	1789220	they don't, mainly because I avoid assuming too much. I guess the one that I kind of changed my
1789220	1793860	opinion on was Oxhorn, I remember when I first looked into that, I hit a few videos that didn't
1793860	1799060	really convince me, and I even watched Oxhorn's response video, and I think around three videos
1799060	1803380	in when someone actually showed some evidence that my mind was swayed to be slightly more
1803380	1808420	skeptical of how he handled himself. Generally speaking though, I don't find my expectations
1808420	1812900	too easily subverted, obviously when the James Charles case went down, I was swayed one way,
1812900	1817060	and then swayed back the other, but that was all kind of happening in real time, so it's hard to
1817060	1822500	exactly compare it to other stories. When I'm writing, as said, there's an element of spontaneity
1822500	1827460	to it, a lot of people ask how I approach scripting, and for me I always say it is written
1827460	1831940	quite like an essay, but I use a lot of rhetorical devices that would typically be absent from a
1831940	1837140	written piece. I often imagine how I would say it in person, I may even repeat myself out loud when
1837140	1841460	reading through the script to make sure it flows relatively naturally, obviously these things aren't
1841460	1845860	completely perfect, but generally I think they flow quite smoothly with my approach. Once I'm
1845860	1850820	happy with the script, I will go into the recording studio, which is right now the cloak room in my
1850820	1855620	house, though I am working on another room to hopefully make that a bit easier. I take a stool,
1855700	1859220	put a load of cushion so I'm at a good angle with my microphone on the desk,
1859220	1864820	and I get going. It's not the most convenient, but we make it work. I know that's why my audio
1864820	1869940	can be a tad inconsistent, and some people with sensitive ears will pick it up, so once I have
1869940	1874260	a more solid studio hopefully that'll ease the issue. I often record it in one sitting,
1874260	1878180	though because I'm rather pedantic I will often make changes to these scripts because I'm never
1878180	1882580	satisfied. I'll go back and redo lines, and send them through to the editors with caveats,
1882580	1886420	I use strikethrough for text that I want to remove, and bold text for the script that I
1886420	1891060	want to add. After the audio is cut, I send it to the editors for visuals, I get a lot of questions
1891060	1895460	about the hiring of editors, but really it's just people contacting me, me seeing it, and then
1895460	1900900	initiating a discussion. I have an idea of what I like in my head, but I allow diversity, I think
1900900	1905220	it could make the video more colourful, even if it's not to everyone's taste. I will sometimes
1905220	1910260	split edits tactically, maybe if I feel one editor is more suited to one part. I typically split my
1910260	1915620	audios into 5-7 minute segments, so there's some way that it can be followed. My editors tend to
1915620	1920020	do their own thing with some guidance, they also pick up various character stills, which,
1920020	1924340	if you are an artist, I've decided to create a crediting list for these videos, so please
1924340	1929300	contact me if your stills are being used in these videos. However, the work doesn't end there,
1929300	1934100	first I need to write up a reference list for the editors, I learned this fairly early on in
1934100	1938820	my career that this was necessary or else you're not going to see what you envision to be on the
1938820	1943540	screen, and I liked showing relevant footage for the topics that I discuss. That's also at the
1943540	1948180	reference sheet that you guys see if you've ever looked for them in the pinned comment, I used to
1948180	1952500	put them directly in the pinned comment, but I had situations where I was posting them, and I guess
1952500	1956820	the comment was too long or YouTube didn't like it, so in the end I just put them in another
1956820	1961540	document and left the link in the pinned comment. I'll do references, and provided I don't make too
1961540	1966180	many changes, I will receive people's versions, at that point I'll have another editor compile
1966180	1970420	these versions, and then send it over to me. Now the first draft often isn't perfect,
1970420	1974740	I've either forgotten to add something, an editor's misinterpreted a direction,
1974740	1978980	either of us could've made mistakes. So what happens is that either I'll have an editor
1978980	1983140	for post make the correction, or I'll have the original editor make the correction themselves,
1983140	1987140	sometimes an editor will want to make the change to their own part for the sake of continuity,
1987140	1990980	sometimes they're rather indifferent, sometimes we've had communication issues on this,
1990980	1995460	but overall I like to think we do it alright. I'm really proud of the progress and how many
1995460	2000500	editors have managed to keep up as the style has evolved, and I think that's something to celebrate.
2001620	2006180	The viewers times we've gone over a video is twice, but sometimes we've gone over it
2006180	2011460	six or seven times, and then come to release. Obviously I've got uploads, normally I try and
2011460	2016500	get the video review for monetisation pre-upload, it's very important due to the resources that I'm
2016500	2020740	already sinking into these videos, and I often don't trust YouTube to keep it monetised post
2020740	2025220	released. There was a pretty rough patch last year with monetisation around the time of the
2025220	2030100	Matt Watson drama, but since then it's been okay, I don't tend to do too much with the metadata,
2030100	2035220	I used to do more, but in hindsight I don't think it has a huge stake in the performance of videos.
2035220	2039300	I put the video intro into the description sometimes, seems like a nice little touch,
2039300	2043460	and it might help out with the search algorithm. We'll try and get a nice thumbnail,
2043460	2047620	almost all my thumbnails have come from the man himself, Starfo, although grade A under-ray part
2047620	2054020	2 was done by my main man Linuski, and around three weeks after we began, we upload, and I
2054020	2058420	anxiously anticipate that hopefully I haven't missed a glaring issue. One of the times where
2058420	2063380	that annoyingly happened was my Austin Jones video, although a piece I'm obviously very proud of.
2063380	2069380	Around the 35 minute mark you can hear this very high pitched background noise, which continues
2069380	2074340	until around the 40 minute mark if I recall correctly. That was pretty frustrating, so to
2074340	2078900	have to proof watch all these videos multiple times can be a task, and sometimes my friends
2078900	2083060	will watch it for me. Obviously there are some changes that they cannot advise on, but they'll
2083060	2087860	typically pick up if there are any glitches. The behaviour of uploads is strange, I'm a bit
2087860	2091940	pedantic, and therefore that leads to indecision over things like titles, which you may have seen
2091940	2096500	me change in the past mid-upload, and I do apologise if anyone has been confused into
2096500	2101700	thinking I've uploaded a new video. Honestly, I sometimes feel slightly uncertain about stuff,
2102260	2106500	but we made it this far, and I think that'll lead me to my next parts.
2112740	2117220	A lot of people ask me what my plans are, how all of my previous plans have proceeded,
2117220	2121540	and I have talked about my personal ideas in previous videos, so I appreciate people
2121540	2126740	keeping me focused on them. Obviously I spoke about the progress with the podcast and so on,
2126740	2131140	but there's a load of other stuff. I heard a fair few questions about music,
2131140	2136020	and although I've probably mentioned this before, my favourite artists are Elton John, Queen, Robbie
2136020	2141540	Williams, ELO, that sort of vibe. I'm into a large majority of genres, providing it's not too loud or
2141540	2146420	aggressive, or lacking a structure that I myself enjoy, which is a pretty conventional one,
2146420	2151220	apologies to all you metalheads. Nonetheless, that's not the crux of the question, because
2151220	2155540	as some of you may know, I'm a trained vocalist. In fact, back in an older video,
2155540	2158980	the legendary TikTok predator, I wanted to do a music clip.
2158980	2166660	Whatever happened to the love that we used to send?
2166660	2172660	Whatever happened to the time I could be the one you could depend?
2172660	2177940	Whatever happened to the time we used to spend?
2177940	2184580	Together, I thought this was forever, now it's way till the end.
2184580	2189140	Because I didn't want to be claimed, I decided that I would use one of my own songs,
2189140	2194580	which is Until The End by Jaydance, though I think on Spotify it's called Waiting For The End.
2194580	2199540	I made the song when I was 16, I've always had a bit of an if melodies, and my other song of
2199540	2203460	That One Morning Sun is quite popular with the people I've shared it with. I'm definitely
2203460	2207940	planning on doing more music this year, but I probably need more time and resources to
2207940	2213300	dedicate to that hustle. The final goal is an album, but I'd like to feel like I have creative
2213300	2217860	control, and that's not something that I quite have yet. I'd love to maybe drop a little demo,
2217860	2222100	and then use it to maybe build a platform off. When I started, the initial plan was to use this
2222100	2226980	as a platform to hopefully launch some of my other media-oriented careers, but at the same time,
2226980	2231780	I'm not sure at which point I should attempt to launch it. I'm actually working on a few rap tracks
2231780	2236420	with an editor and friend by the name of Cold, if you follow my Instagram you may have heard a clip
2236420	2240980	from one of them, it's a fun thing to do, and though I'm not expecting it of any great success,
2241060	2247460	it would be pretty cool. Regarding other media, I have a load of film ideas, I recently started
2247460	2251620	a document where I write them all down, one of the things I've always wanted to do is to
2251620	2256180	screenwrite and direct a film. As mentioned earlier, I had considered agreeing it at one
2256180	2260820	point, but thought it was too risky. I don't have too much formal training, but I do like to think
2260820	2265540	that I would be in touch with human conflicts that could drive my plots and dialogue, though
2265540	2270420	I'm not sure if that's enough for such a challenge. I would really like to consider it
2270420	2275300	at one point, but for now I guess I'll just leave it on the back burner. I did make a parody movie
2275300	2277860	with my friends, maybe you guys will see it one day.
2277860	2304260	A truly classic clip, my ultimate goal is creative media, I cannot lie, but you also gotta be realistic
2304260	2308260	sometimes, you can't just waltz in and declare yourself the next Laurence Olivier, you have to
2308260	2314340	prove your worth in such a cutthroat industry, so I don't hold out hope, any success there will be
2314340	2319140	a pleasant surprise. Relating to this channel, obviously I hope I can be more ambitious, maybe
2319140	2323700	try and integrate a sense of self into some of my videos, there are also some burning issues that have
2323700	2329220	been on my mind relating to YouTube that I want to talk about, however I feel like a facecam character
2329220	2334180	break would be a good way to do them. Back when H3 did their YouTube callout videos, it's a shame
2334180	2338900	they don't do them anymore, it's not like people have fewer bones to pick with YouTube, and even
2338900	2343220	other transpiring situations that I don't feel comfortable with my current format would be good
2343220	2347780	to talk about too, however I don't want to commit to too much, because it is quite a nerve-wracking
2347780	2352900	thought for me. I also get a lot of political questions, whether I'm gonna go back into politics,
2352900	2357380	and although I addressed this in my previous Q&A, I guess I'm prepared to talk about it briefly here.
2357380	2362500	I have considered trying political content again, not on this channel, but maybe starting up another
2362500	2367220	channel where I do more live footage, content talking about politics, maybe integrated with some
2367220	2372580	creative ideas that would allow me to try out some of my cinematic tendencies. However, as a lot of
2372580	2377540	people have noted, it's a really toxic environment, and I'm not sure I'm mentally ready to do something
2377540	2382820	like that. Politically, there are no creators out there that fully represent how I feel. I'm not
2382820	2387860	right-wing, I like a lot the leftist guys, and that's how I identify, but some of the communities
2387860	2394580	seriously concern me with their strange drive for ideological purity, and I'll be honest, I'm not
2394580	2400340	pure, I'm not perfect, and I'm not out here to let angry people affect my political views.
2400340	2405540	I'm not gonna have what I believe in be based on tone policing, but if I ever did politics again,
2405540	2410340	I doubt I would try and be part of a greater political community. I'm not here to tell others
2410340	2415540	how to feel or how to handle their grievances with a broken system, but I've just never had
2415540	2421620	the personal ability to be that vitriolic to people with differing opinions within reason,
2421620	2426900	and I feel I'd be dead by 25 if I took that mentality. I might be anyway, but I at least gotta
2426900	2432340	try and take care of myself. As for other channels, yeah, I have a few projects in the mixer, I'm setting
2432340	2437140	up a Twitch channel, and that would be pretty swell. I might have a highlights channel, as said,
2437140	2441220	when I see some of my friends having such a good time, I feel like I should try and get in on this
2441220	2446340	as well, although obviously I'll be doing my own thing. I'm also setting up some side projects,
2446340	2452020	lower pressure, less dramatic things, maybe even some very light entertainment. I don't expect it
2452020	2456580	to affect my upload schedule, I can work quite efficiently where I need to, and to be honest,
2456580	2460580	I think the chaos is dying down for the start of the year, and I'm prepared to take it on.
2460580	2465540	If you hear my voice on another channel, don't be fazed that I'm doing something that you might not
2465540	2470500	expect me to do. Then there's merch, I receive a few questions about that, I am doing merch soon,
2470500	2475780	I've been beta testing some products, I'm gonna be releasing this really nice twat mug which reveals
2475780	2481940	itself when heated, that's one thing that I actually actively like, which is a rarity. I also
2481940	2487060	have this white text on black hoodie which reads too much free time for all you people out there
2487060	2491940	who feel the vibe. The other thing that I'm trying to do a tad more are sponsorships, as I'm still
2492020	2496180	rather cagey on YouTube's monetisation policy and the fact that they could change tomorrow.
2496180	2500420	There's never a feeling of security in anything that you earn, but the whole drama with better
2500420	2504820	help really switched me off, and since then I've only done two sponsorships. The latter was
2504820	2509540	obviously the raid one, which was great fun, because they let me and the internet historian
2509540	2514820	take the piss, but I wanna do some sponsorships where I can go in and say this brand is actually
2514820	2519460	really good. However, on top of that, I actually want to use sponsor slots as a way to platform
2519460	2523540	other creators, with the assurance of giving them a cut of the money made through that as well,
2523540	2527380	it'll give them some space to show off their creative abilities and sell themselves,
2527380	2531940	as well as the product, so although it's gonna take me a while to probably sort this out,
2531940	2536580	that's another idea that's been playing on my mind. I also have a few other things I want to
2536580	2541780	talk about too, and some other casual questions that I'll be happy to respond to, so let's go there right now.
2543780	2549060	It's time to clean up some of the questions here and there, that I wasn't sure quite how to fit in.
2549060	2552820	A fairly regular question has been about topics, obviously I explained how I pick them,
2552820	2557380	and my process, but I do get questions about these sorts of topics. I want to keep this channel's main
2557380	2562260	focus on YouTube topics, I will probably push the boat out here and there, I have a plan for
2562260	2567380	collab where I talk about a TV show for example, but there'll be more treats of sorts, and they still
2567380	2572260	talk about similar dynamics. I may make another channel where I occasionally post videos about
2572260	2576900	less YouTube related topics, there has been one very highly requested topic that I don't really
2576900	2580900	want to cover on this channel, but it has my attention given certain details which have piqued
2580900	2586420	my interest. I do feel my channel works for a certain type of video, and I'm still coming to grips
2586420	2590900	with which ones work best. A few times I've spoken about predators and their behaviour,
2590900	2596580	and since then I've often received messages from people about others doing some very terrible
2596580	2601540	things, often criminal, and asking me if I would expose them, and often that stuff makes me very
2601540	2606100	nervous, and I typically suggest that it's referred to criminal authorities first. It's why I've become
2606100	2610420	a lot more tentative when people are offered to send me evidence privately, I take preference to
2610420	2615620	talking about what's out there already right now. Some people ask me about my branding and what I
2615620	2620420	consider myself to be, and I don't like to make too many comments because although it's a cliche,
2620420	2624500	I like to be myself and let people interpret what they think of me, whether that means they think
2624500	2630340	I'm a commentator, an entertainer, a philosopher, an investigator, or a dickhead, so be it. I don't
2630340	2635300	run any specific algorithm in my head for how I create my content, obviously I have methods,
2635300	2640100	but I never really think about what I can do and what specific reaction it may provoke,
2640100	2644740	but I guess that brings me to my next point about advice that I would give to people, and I never
2644740	2649140	really say too much generally speaking, because the formula will always differ depending on the
2649140	2654500	person, but I guess the best thing that I would say to a creator is to ask yourself, why would a
2654500	2659220	viewer want to watch your content as opposed to other creators on the platform, and I think that's
2659220	2663700	a good question because it was the one detail I often overlooked when making my earlier content,
2663700	2668900	I never left an impact. When I ask that question, I don't mean it to discourage anyone or play on
2668900	2674100	their insecurities, but more to stimulate them to think about how they can innovate their brand
2674100	2679220	and carve out their own niche, and I think that's my other point, try not to be dissuaded by the
2679220	2684420	fact that some people won't enjoy what you're doing, everyone has different tastes, try not
2684420	2689940	to take it too personally, even if they try and make it personal. A lot of questions about dating
2689940	2695060	and a few people asking me out, calling me cute, which I'm very flattered by, I think that's one
2695060	2699860	of the things about YouTube life, it has definitely made it harder for dating. I've had two formal
2699860	2704340	dates in the last year, they were both nice, but in the end it just became impractical when I'm
2704340	2709780	still so restless. There are a lot of online ships, and I'd be lying if I didn't say I catch feelings,
2709780	2715460	but it's complicated. I'm a person with very high walls, and I'm unsure how involved with YouTube
2715460	2721220	I'd want my spouse to be. It's lonely, and I'm lonely, but you can't force these things.
2721220	2725220	I also have a lot of identity questions that I've never really got the chance to think about because
2725220	2730500	my life has been so hectic, and I want to resolve some of them before I can commit to someone else,
2730500	2735860	who may fall in love with someone I don't feel I really am. A lot of people ask me what my type is,
2735860	2740820	and I don't like to say too much, but I like people who I describe as energetic introverts,
2740820	2745700	there's an element of reservation but a shade of optimism too. I think I need that balance in my
2745700	2751620	life, I think I need someone stable to provide some security and ease my paranoia. My celebrity
2751620	2757620	crush would be Tom Holland I suppose, so if you want a general idea of what I'm into appearance-wise,
2757620	2763300	well there it is, but there's flexibility on those fronts. Some people ask what I do to try and relax,
2763300	2768820	emphasis on the try there. I like sports, I play some squash to mainly maintain fitness,
2768820	2773380	I'd like to do more football, or soccer, as you may call it, in fact, I think I'm pretty good in a
2773380	2777700	wing-bat position. However, I suffer from these nerve problems in my arms which make it more
2777700	2782580	difficult to participate in such activities, really bad pins and needles, and no one knows
2782580	2786820	exactly what to do about them, although I've had a couple appointments here and there and attempts
2786820	2792260	to alleviate it. I obviously enjoy music, and I spoke about that, I also enjoy cinema, you guys
2792260	2796580	probably know my favourite movie as Hot Fuzz, but if you're more interested in following my film
2796580	2802420	taste you can check out my Letterboxd. I like TV shows, I'm currently watching Fargo and Better
2802420	2808260	Call Saul with my family, both pretty epic, I like them. I also enjoy quizzing, for people who know me
2808260	2813540	I have a bit of an obsession with the acquisition of information, and that can be seen in pub quizzes.
2813540	2818260	I would really like to go on a game show, so if there are any game show executives watching this
2818260	2824740	video, hey, hit me up, I have applied a fair few times. The final goal is to win Who Wants To Be
2824740	2829300	A Millionaire. I don't know if I'll ever have the opportunity, but a boy can dream, eh?
2829300	2834020	As for YouTube, the creators that I watch, I watch Todd and the Shadows, Billboard Breakdown
2834020	2839620	by Spectrum, Pulse, I Hate Everything, Internet Historian, Pyrocynical, Mr. Gigi, obviously The
2839620	2846020	Boys, Primink, J. Aubrey, Average Pixel, all those beautiful lads, I could go on. If there's a topic
2846020	2850180	that captures my interest, then I'll probably watch the video, providing I don't actually dislike the
2850180	2854420	creator's content. An interesting question is about who I really want to collaborate with, and that's
2854420	2859060	a difficult one, because I can collaborate with a lot of people who I haven't yet that are pretty
2859060	2863940	obvious, and I could just say, you know, Primink, and obviously you guys would know that completely,
2863940	2869140	so I guess I can throw a curveball in there, one person who I think would be cool is Pyrocynical.
2869140	2872660	He's always been really pleasant, treats me like an individual, remembers details that
2872660	2877300	I don't remember telling him, so that would be good. I haven't really had much contact though, as
2877300	2882100	he's wise enough to stay off social media. A lot of people have asked me about alternative career
2882100	2886260	paths, if YouTube packed up tomorrow, what I'd do, and I think that's a hard question. I'd really
2886260	2890900	like to politics again, I'm very interested in local politics, I recently rejoined my local
2890900	2895380	liberal Democrat party because I feel like there are still a lot of local issues that matter to me.
2895380	2900180	I walk down the street, and the town is just so depressing, and I feel like there's so much more
2900180	2906260	that can be done, but I also still don't know if I belong with them. Creative arts, of course,
2906260	2910260	who knows what would happen there. I always worry that my status as a YouTube commentator would
2910260	2915300	prevent me from being accepted in other places, but I think maybe that's a bit more of my paranoia,
2915300	2919540	it's tiring stuff being this eccentric. I'm not sure if there are too many other questions that I
2919540	2925060	want to respond to now, obviously gotta save some for my next Q&A. I'll score some quick fire points,
2925060	2930100	my favourite colour is red, my favourite animals are probably dogs, I'd love to dye my hair silvery
2930100	2936100	white sometimes, thank you Franny, I'd marry them all and maybe kill them afterwards. I actually
2936100	2940020	love Mario Kart and I will beat you at it, you were never allowed out of the basement, probably
2940580	2946420	Asda, bees are good, I am hydrated, and no I have not heard about Raid Shadow Legends, please tell me more.
2946980	2953140	Really? No. Oh, and my favourite video? Well, I guess it could be this one, it's refreshing and
2953140	2957140	different, I know I can't do them every day, but it allowed me to talk about things that are close
2957140	2961940	to me, and things that have been playing on my mind, hopefully you learned a bit too, but if you
2961940	2966820	discount this one, probably Austin Jones, in spite of the annoying glitch. Thank you guys for watching,
2966820	2969460	I'm The Right Opinion, and I'll see you in the next one.
