00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,800
Hello ladies and gentlemen, welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time,

2
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:27,100
and boy oh boy, is this a video I've been waiting to do for a while. In fact, I had originally planned to do this as some 500k subscriber special,

3
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:32,980
but alas, time flies, and so many events occurred at that time that it was impossible to find a place for this video,

4
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:39,420
but now everything's opened up a tiny bit more, I'm feeling more comfortable to take the time to talk about, well, a lot.

5
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:44,140
At one point, I'd also planned to make this a New Year's kinda thing, kinda resolution sort of vibe,

6
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:49,500
but knowing how long these videos take, I think there's a reasonable chance that it's closer to next year by the time this video's out.

7
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:55,100
That is, of course, a hilarious joke, though knowing how long it takes on my videos, you may well have believed it.

8
00:00:55,140 --> 00:01:00,340
Obviously, this is a minor instalment in the Troe catalogue, but I still think it's a necessary one.

9
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:06,460
As implied in the title, there will be a Q&A that will hopefully provide you with a little more insight on the man behind the Avatar.

10
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:13,700
I also have a fair few announcements to make, but first of all, I would love to spend some time thanking those who have helped me on this rather chaotic journey.

11
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:18,900
The main party who has probably played the most prominent part in this advancement are of course the editors,

12
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:23,620
now as you probably know, I have a fair few editors, so I'll be leaving them all in the pinned comment,

13
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:30,620
however, I do want to give a few special mentions to individuals who have gone above and beyond the Call of Duty in the past few months in particular.

14
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:33,980
It's hard to know exactly who to start with, but I'd like to mention Peter Day.

15
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:40,220
He has worked around the clock with some of the toughest edits and post-edits, when other people haven't been quite able to follow through,

16
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:45,140
he has been on call every time, no exception. The dude is a superhuman, and I can't understate that.

17
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:50,180
We're going to be working on a new channel project together ourselves, and I can't wait to get that off the ground.

18
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:56,340
I'd also like to give thanks to anyone who has helped post-edit on a regular basis, most notably to Linuski and Mullenax.

19
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:02,180
If you've ever heard the Danganronpa music in the background, then I can tell you that was the product of Mullenax's magic.

20
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:07,540
They're both also really talented editors on their own terms with incredibly distinctive styles, I love what they do,

21
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:13,380
and all three of these beautiful people have been working with me for over a year, and I hope that we can continue working through this one.

22
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:18,180
I'd also like to give a mention to people who have consistently delivered high quality edits on a regular basis.

23
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:22,340
A large majority of my editors have, and we've all worked on improving throughout the year.

24
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:26,260
It's good to slowly work to push the bar higher, and I hope I can match their quality.

25
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:32,260
I also want to give a big shoutout to my Discord server, the admins, and the head admin, and furry, Derumasis.

26
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:37,620
Many of you probably don't know that when I was starting off on YouTube, I ran Colossalist's crazy server for a bit,

27
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:43,140
and it was an absolute nightmare. Discord has obviously made it easier to manage certain elements since then,

28
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:47,460
but it's still a challenge, and when I was working on it, it was always tough to make a decision that I felt

29
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:53,860
would represent the Discord owner in question, so if you see him, tell him he does an alright job, and that he's a furry.

30
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:58,260
He loves to be told that he's a furry, guys. I'd also like to thank my Patreons for their support,

31
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:02,180
it gives me a bit more security when talking about topics that may be sensitive.

32
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:08,180
Obviously, I'm always paying money to others for their work on my videos, and so their contributions are a lifeline.

33
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:15,700
I don't really plug my Patreon too much, I only mention it right at the end of the videos, and a lot of people tend to click off before that point.

34
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:20,020
So the fact that some actively seek it out and involve themselves like that does mean a lot to me.

35
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:27,300
I want to give a special mention to my $50 Patreons, Sumhala Baloo, Nico Deschamps, Caroline, Cole P Hennessy, and Hypercube,

36
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:33,780
they are all doing a fantastic job, thank you so much, guys. Sumhala Baloo has been supporting for over a year now,

37
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:39,620
which I just think is incredible, and I'd also like to give an extra special mention to Brandon Stanton,

38
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:46,180
Christopher Kraz, and Be More Cool J, my $100 Patreons. Brandon, who once again has been donating for over a year now.

39
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:52,020
I actually have never spoken to him, but if you are watching from afar, know that your generosity does not go unnoticed.

40
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:57,540
I want to thank all my friends, YouTube and non-YouTube, you need both to maintain some semblance of sanity.

41
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:02,180
It's been really cool building public bonds with fantastic creators like Primink and J Aubrey,

42
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:06,740
which is the only time I plan on pronouncing his name correctly, it will be J Aubrey for eternity.

43
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:14,260
I will be starting a podcast with our good friend Jon soon, and I'll leave a link in the pinned comment if you want to go and subscribe to it.

44
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:19,620
I know a lot of people were anticipating a podcast with Primink too, and as much as I want that, we both really do,

45
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:24,340
because our banter is uncontested. Unfortunately, he's got a few other issues to deal with first,

46
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:29,300
but I'm confident we'll make it a real thing eventually. Beyond that, I have a load of fellow creators to thank,

47
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:35,620
IHE, Colossal, anyone who got me started and promoted my work, and on top of that, I want to thank everyone

48
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:40,580
I've had the pleasure of meeting at events, VidCon, Insomnia, all of them are really enlightening,

49
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:45,300
and a reminder that at the end of the day, we're all human, even if we're behind a screen most of the time.

50
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:50,020
Any viewers I've met at those events too, it's really cool, I actually do want to do more meetups,

51
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:56,420
but I find them a bit daunting, I had a couple experiences that put me off, but overall, they've been really positive ones that I have had.

52
00:04:56,420 --> 00:05:00,740
So yeah, I've mentioned a lot of people, however, most importantly, I have you guys to thank,

53
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:05,380
I want to thank you for your continued support, and I hope I can represent that in the best way possible.

54
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:09,300
It's admittedly been an interesting year, and I'll go into more detail about that soon,

55
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:14,740
but it's good to have some people who will pull you through regardless. Without stroking your ego too much,

56
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:18,820
it's good to have an audience who are pretty constructive in how they respond, how they reach out,

57
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:24,020
and even how they deliver criticism. I'm not perfect, and we'll probably talk about that more in the Q&A section,

58
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:28,900
but someone messaged me saying that they really appreciated that in spite of my rather pessimistic outlook,

59
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:34,740
I try and see the best in people. I don't think that would be possible without people around me who take a similar philosophy,

60
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:40,420
I am truly grateful for that. For now, I think it's best we enter the Q&A section, because some of you people

61
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:46,340
really want to find out more about me, to be honest. Well, there's a lot to discuss, so I suggest we get into it.

62
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:59,220
Alright, so before we get into this, I'll make it clear that if you haven't watched my last Q&A,

63
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:03,540
I don't tend to go from question to question, I tend to try and give overarching answers that

64
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:07,460
hopefully satisfy general points of interest, though of course I'll show some examples of

65
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:11,780
questions so it doesn't look like I'm conducting an interview of myself. I'd also stress that there

66
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:16,420
are some things that I may not talk about again, because I already spoke about them in my previous

67
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:21,300
Q&A, and I don't want to be merely repeating myself, though I probably will. There's still a lot to talk

68
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:26,340
about though, a lot, because last time I made one of these, I wasn't too detailed. Today I'll be

69
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:30,740
showing a bit more, and maybe throwing a little shade, so I hope you do enjoy that.

70
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:37,300
I guess one of the questions that I receive a lot is why I started, and that's a complex story, which,

71
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:41,860
if asked before, I probably didn't go into too much depth, I probably said something like,

72
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:50,020
oh I was bored, which isn't entirely true, so let's do that now. We go back to 2015, I believe.

73
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:55,460
I decided to take a gap year, mainly because I wasn't quite confident that I knew exactly what I

74
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:59,700
wanted to do at university. Initially, I had applied for script writing, but I began to have

75
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:04,020
cold feet that it would be a very difficult industry to infiltrate, so instead of taking any

76
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:08,340
of the offers I had received, I decided to hang back and make some new applications.

77
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:13,060
After a bit of rumination, I found a course at a prestigious university that suited my interest,

78
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:18,900
and I decided to apply for that. I also had various backup offers, but once I set my mind

79
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:24,740
on a goal, it's hard to turn it onto anything else. Nonetheless, it was a painful process,

80
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:29,300
there are a few stages, and it ends in a final interview stage at the actual college,

81
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:34,340
so obviously I had to submit my application, and then I had to take this test, which I vigorously

82
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:38,660
revised for with one of my close friends, shout out to Cheyenne, you're a legend. That went well,

83
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:43,460
and then I was invited to the university. Now, at this point, I probably had a false sense of

84
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:48,740
security, because I'm quite good at interviews generally speaking, or at least I thought I was,

85
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:53,140
and when I was there, I had such an incredible time, they make it an incredible time, they hold

86
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:57,460
these events, make you feel part of their family. Looking back on it, they kinda led me on.

87
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:02,980
Because of that, I began to envision my future a bit too keenly, I had an idea in my mind of where

88
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:08,900
I wanted to be, I had my mind on the university experience, and I should've managed my expectations

89
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:13,860
better, because it didn't work out, and I think when I found out was one of the first times that

90
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:19,780
I just felt this emotional black hole swallowing me. When I received the test results, which you

91
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:24,180
receive after their verdict for some reason, because they were pretty high, I decided to make

92
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:29,620
an inquiry about what they felt I could've done better, and after just a month, they gave me this

93
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:34,500
email. The assessing tutors thought you gave a good interview, but unfortunately, given the

94
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:40,260
competition for places, they felt there were stronger candidates. Oh, really, I thought the

95
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:48,180
tutors were purposely giving places to weaker candidates. I felt insulted. I had waited almost

96
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:54,740
a month to basically be told, you lost because other people beat you. This was 2016 by the way,

97
00:08:54,740 --> 00:09:00,420
I should probably clarify that, we are now into 2016, and this kinda flipped my mentality on its

98
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:05,540
head at the time, because I've always sought out the idea that I do need to improve, right the

99
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:12,820
wrongs, and yet, I gave this so much of my all, and received such a vague answer regarding something

100
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:20,260
I cared about so much. I felt like I didn't know what to do better, and neither did they, and I

101
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:25,620
didn't like that feeling, and because of that, I felt like no matter how much I gave, I would never

102
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:31,540
be good enough in other people's eyes, or my own eyes. I was having a rough time in life with

103
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:37,300
General, I felt like a failure, I was an emotional mess who probably flipped out a few times, because

104
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:43,140
plans in my head had fallen apart, I had a good family providing me security, but I didn't have much

105
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:48,500
money, and I always wanted to do something that could change my life. Other career paths were cool,

106
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:53,300
but they were also pretty risky, YouTube seemed like that medium that could work out with a small

107
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:58,260
initial investment, and the idea you could make gradual progress while continuing to support

108
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:04,580
yourself. A few of my friends were doing YouTube at the time as well, Ollie, Ram, Isaac, you know who

109
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:09,220
you are, and they seemed to be having a good time, so I thought it'd be an interesting thing to throw

110
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:13,300
myself into. I think at that point I needed something to take my mind away from various

111
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:17,780
insecurities, and I also wanted to prove to myself that I was good enough. I'm a perfectionist, and

112
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:23,060
for multiple reasons that I'm probably going to go into eventually, my life had felt less than

113
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:27,860
perfect. I was inspired by creators such as I Hate Everything, Odessa Buckley, and music critics such

114
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:32,740
as Todd in the Shadows. I based the persona on a rather British stereotype due to my demeanor, and

115
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:38,580
of course the accent, which yes, it is real, I thought it was good branding at least. Obviously,

116
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:43,380
when I started, I made quite different content to what I do today. A lot of the first videos focused

117
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:48,500
on political commentary, quite casual but stinging criticism of the then incumbent Conservative Party

118
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:53,220
and many of their policies, politics was something that I was highly passionate about at the time,

119
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:57,780
and therefore I thought maybe mixing the genre of politics with short form commentary could work

120
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:03,300
out. With the help from my friends Isaac, also now known as Viri, and Jack, I managed to put

121
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:08,260
out a decent amount of content, however I wasn't particularly invested in the channel at the time.

122
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:13,620
I just wanted to make some videos where I chatted about stuff. I still had a lot of friends, and we

123
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:18,580
partook in various activities, for example we even went to Rome on the back of a few hundred quid that

124
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:23,380
each of us had, and that was fun. There are vlogs of that trip online still, I'll leave them in the

125
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:28,740
pinned comment if you wanna see some footage of me prior to this fun little hobby. For the first few

126
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:34,020
months I didn't really see YouTube beyond that hobby that would maybe blow up if I was fortunate.

127
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:39,140
That all changed when I started university, which is strange because I was expecting university to

128
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:44,420
be the end of my YouTube career. I went to Amsterdam to keep it vague, and it didn't go well,

129
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:51,700
it wasn't good on the basis that it was already a disappointing result in my head, and this was also

130
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:56,980
in the wake of the very significant Brexit vote, and a fair few people at the college had taken it

131
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:00,900
very personally. Now, I'm not particularly enthusiastic about Britain's withdrawal from

132
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:05,460
the European Union, but if you have watched my old videos, in spite of my generally left political

133
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:10,420
persuasion, you'll know that I'm a firm critic of the European Union, much of their procedure and

134
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:16,740
structure. Go back half a century, and a lot of Eurosceptics were on the left, but by 2016 it was

135
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:22,020
clearly associated with right-wing ideology, and I think a lot of people jumped to conclusions about

136
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:28,660
my own views, and people were emotional. That sort of stuff happens. I'm not mad about it, but the

137
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:34,100
consequences were not great, people saw a few critical Facebook posts and it spiralled. I tried

138
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:38,740
to shake it off at the start of the year by really involving myself in various activities, but I think

139
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:43,940
I gave up after a month and just receded onto the online world. Probably one of the most defining

140
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:48,820
experiences was in the second week. I remember I had a few new friends around to watch a film on

141
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:54,100
my TV, and I went to grab my laundry. I always did my laundry really late at night, because I hated

142
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:58,180
taking my laundry there and finding all the washing machines occupied. Some other British

143
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:02,580
freshman who had clearly been drinking too much with his friends ended up swearing at me in the

144
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:08,660
street, and although I returned verbal fire, which was foolish, I felt very shaken. And following that,

145
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:13,060
I felt always some distance from other students. I'm not gonna make myself out to be some kind of

146
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:17,940
victim, but knowing you're being subjected to differing levels of judgement from people,

147
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:22,420
and never knowing what they think about you, and knowing that people are talking about you behind

148
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:27,940
your back, is isolating. At that point, I became more involved with the online world again. I'd

149
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:33,380
work on ColossusCrazy's Discord server, I'd work on more videos, I think I aimed to get three a week

150
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:38,340
at some point. A lot of them are videos that frankly I don't really remember, nor do I really

151
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:42,900
want to remember, though I might have a more cynical memory than that which is warranted.

152
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:47,460
However, as you know, that's not the content that I was making today. Let's talk about that then,

153
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,580
and how I got here.

154
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:57,540
So that's the question, how did I end up making what I do today from my very humble beginnings,

155
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:01,700
and the evolution that has occurred, because you know, for a long time, I had been making

156
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:06,740
short form videos relating to political topics, so I guess we have to tackle two more things.

157
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:11,300
Why did I make my videos longer, and why do I not cover political topics anymore?

158
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:17,060
Let's talk about my political evolution first, because my political journey was much like an arc.

159
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:21,620
I spoke about this in my previous Q&A, but once again we have more time for the Tro-Law than

160
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:27,380
previous, so since I've left university, I've felt less motivation to conceal my feelings and

161
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:32,100
the drama that occurred. The first couple years had pushed me in various directions politically,

162
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:37,060
the exposure to rather hostile individuals in Amsterdam definitely made me bitter to a cause

163
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:41,860
that I previously identified with, and it had made me more outspoken in a way. It was a late

164
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:47,060
stage rebellious period in my mind, and I didn't stay at Amsterdam, which is very important.

165
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:53,060
That's a fun little story actually. In February 2017, I suffered from probably one of the worst

166
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:57,700
illnesses that I'd ever had in my life. They never actually diagnosed it, but my temperature

167
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:03,540
was soaring, I had jaundice, it was really nasty stuff, I lost a month of class, and I even went

168
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:08,820
home for treatment. Because of this, I missed a significant number of courses, five if I recall.

169
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:13,540
Now, for four of the courses, the tutors were highly accommodating, and allowed me to partake

170
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:17,940
in any of the assessments that I had missed. However, there was this one class, of which I

171
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:23,140
didn't have the best experience anyway, the tutor wasn't fond of my outspoken nature, and the

172
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:28,020
feeling was mutual. I had missed the last week of lessons, which of course, wouldn't normally be a

173
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:34,100
big deal, but because it was an intensive course, she insisted that I had to retake the whole 23

174
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:39,620
lessons, an idea that I did not find palace ball, considering I'd been there for 19 lessons.

175
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:44,740
So I appealed to the relevant academic board, who decided that actually, they wanted to support the

176
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:48,900
tutor's decision. I assumed at first they were ill informed, and sent them all the relevant

177
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:54,100
documentation, doctor's assessments, contributions, I even met with them, I offered compromises, even

178
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:58,180
offering to retake the part of the course that I had missed. Even though I'd done the written

179
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:04,180
assessment, the exam, and worked on part of the group project, they insisted that I had to do the

180
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:09,060
whole thing again. In the end, I took it to the higher appeals board, and although I won the case

181
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:14,340
against them on that level, I had attended a tribunal where I had to represent myself against

182
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:21,060
my own academic board, and that was surreal, and it probably has shaped why I have very little trust

183
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:25,940
in authority. It was undoubtedly the most stressful experience of my life, and at the time, it led to a

184
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:31,140
lot of specific resentment towards the stereotype of what the typical liberal arts represented,

185
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:36,020
leading to a lot of videos that probably served as the antithesis to the philosophy of their

186
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:41,540
attitude. In hindsight, that wasn't the right way to deal with it, and the lesson that I should have

187
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:47,540
learned was much broader than that. You can't rely on others to do the right thing for you, but in 2017,

188
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:52,580
I was definitely at my most political, and it was not in the right way, I was ideologically channeling

189
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:57,540
frustrations against an issue that was beyond ideology, which is why a lot of those videos just

190
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:02,100
aren't up anymore. After this mess, I made a conscious decision to move to a different university.

191
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:07,140
Now, I really didn't want to do this on principle, because I didn't want to lose the academic progress

192
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:11,460
that I made throughout that year, but fortunately, the University of Groningen, also in the Netherlands,

193
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:16,100
offered a straight transfer that allowed me to start in my second year, and that was a very

194
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:20,900
different environment, which completely dissipated many of my frustrations that I had at the previous

195
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:25,620
university. Now, let me make it clear, this wasn't without its problems, I had some issues when I

196
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:31,220
started, but they weren't social. I go along with people fine, even though at that point, I dedicated

197
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:36,180
a significant amount of time to my YouTube grind. I got drunk on many Saturday nights, made a fair

198
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:41,220
few friends, big shout out to Sush You Mad Lad, if you're watching this. It took a few months,

199
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:46,340
probably until January, February, but my opinion on these stereotypes in my head really began to

200
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:50,740
soften, and I tried to diversify my content a little. I remember making a critical video on

201
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:56,260
White Boy by Tom McDonald, and that just got absolutely swarmed with a mix of McDonald fans,

202
00:17:56,260 --> 00:18:01,380
and actual alt writers who, for some reason, weren't the nicest. You know they say there's always

203
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:05,940
one video where you gotta have a negative like to dislike ratio, that was it. At that point,

204
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:10,260
I had a policy of replying to nearly every comment that was made on my videos, but I have to admit

205
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:14,900
my patience began to wither after that one. I realised that my brand of what I viewed as a

206
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:19,140
gender-driven activism probably wasn't the healthiest for me, and that it often pushed

207
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:24,420
me to one side of the debate, when really I wanted to think myself as quite an open-minded person.

208
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:29,780
I think what I realised is that I was still politically naive to a lot of ideas that I had,

209
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:34,900
where I stood, and there was this part of me that I wanted to figure that out, and that a YouTube

210
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:39,540
channel where you post all your thoughts with some degree of confidence and conviction

211
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:44,500
probably wasn't the best if you had changed your mind in a few years. However, I still wanted to

212
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:49,300
make content that could involve me looking at situations, applying various levels of logic and

213
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:54,340
reasoning, something that would challenge me, and at the time a lot of my friends were involved in

214
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:59,460
commentary. In spite of my political narratives, I'd never really fit into any political clique,

215
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:03,780
and no one had ever really invited me, which was fine, but because of that, the only reason that

216
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:08,660
I made those videos was because of my own personal interest, my own attachment, I didn't

217
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:14,980
have an obligation to anyone else. At around that time, early 2018, I also attended an Insomnia

218
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:20,100
gaming festival, which was the first event that I attended as a YouTuber, and it inspired me to take

219
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:25,700
the leap into commentary. However, I was aware of one thing, that there were a lot of commentators,

220
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:30,500
and I'd made commentary videos in the past, and they hadn't done much. The most successful video

221
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:35,460
I had made at that point was a video called Matt Hoss Could Win, and that seemed more like a fluke

222
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:39,860
than anything else. So I realised that I had to do something unique, I had to leave an impact with

223
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:44,980
my content, so I took a look at my resources and what I had going for me, I had relatively strong

224
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:49,460
community standing, a persistent determination, some experience in writing, and a strong

225
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:54,260
relationship with some very talented editors. So I thought, well, let's put it all together,

226
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:59,220
make longer videos, videos with a more personal style, something that will set me apart in what

227
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:04,580
I'm doing, and yet maintain a decent upload schedule, and so I began making videos in that

228
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:08,820
style. This wasn't without its problems, and it still isn't, there are obviously going to be some

229
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:13,620
inconsistencies in the visuals, and even though there is consistency, some people just can't get

230
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:18,980
into that style of video, and I can't blame people if they don't like that approach. For me though,

231
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:23,780
what I think is most important is that feeling of progress, that sentiment that I hope with regards

232
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:28,260
to quality, my videos are moving forward. Obviously, that's subjective to an extent,

233
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:32,180
but if you go back to my earlier videos in this format, and compare them with the ones that I'm

234
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:36,660
doing today, I hope that there is some visible difference, and hopefully one that is for the

235
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:42,340
better, but as said, it hasn't been without its challenges. Let's talk about that a bit more.

236
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:51,060
One of the most significant burning questions that I've received from people is about the mental

237
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:56,340
effect that such content has had on me, and it's a good question, one that is kind of difficult

238
00:20:56,340 --> 00:21:02,180
to respond to, but I'll do my best. It's not been great, no one said this stuff would be easy,

239
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:07,700
and I embrace the challenge, but it's a large burden, and I guess this ties into the questions

240
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:12,980
that I receive about maintaining some emotional distance from the topics. I've even had a few

241
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:18,260
people ask me in the past if I'm a sociopath, which I'm definitely not, but I understand why

242
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:22,660
someone may think that. To enter the topics with the level of emotional distance that I often do

243
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:26,980
is difficult. I think trying to untie your personal feelings from these issues is something

244
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:31,540
that many find too much of a challenge to do themselves, and it's a challenge that I don't

245
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:37,380
always successfully traverse myself, but I guess I was set up for it in a way. When I was growing up,

246
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:42,420
I was an emotional person, extremely emotional, I was very volatile, and my moods often swung from

247
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:46,420
one pole to the other. I've always been very perceptive, so when I felt someone was being

248
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:51,940
unfair, unreasonable, or vindictive, I was prone to being quite abruptly hostile. However, I came

249
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:56,020
to realise that many people wouldn't often come around to your point of view through such an

250
00:21:56,020 --> 00:22:01,460
attitude, and that often you had to use other more restrained techniques. When I was around 12, I had

251
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:05,300
anger management therapy, and this definitely improved me, and although I was still prone to

252
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:10,980
making emotionally based and often rash decisions, in the next few years I continued to work on myself.

253
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:16,260
Life was pretty good through a majority of my teenage years, but I think my gap year combined

254
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:21,780
with my first year of university really fractured my mentality. There were a lot of times where I

255
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:26,660
probably got too emotionally invested in my own expectations, which led to disappointment, and I

256
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:32,420
think that sort of continuous cycle wears you down, and eventually my body just said no to heavy

257
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:37,780
emotional investment, and excitement, and looking forward to things. And this isn't to say I don't

258
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:43,060
still feel things because I do, but I often get this very weird dynamic where I experience more

259
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:49,140
physical emotional reactions than what I feel inside. For example, sometimes I'll do karaoke,

260
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:54,100
and I know it makes me very nervous, and although I won't feel nervous in my head, I'll experience

261
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:59,860
the most terrible tremors. It feels like there's some emotional disconnect between how I feel and

262
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:05,140
how my head tells me to feel, and this I think has allowed me to look at drama from a relatively

263
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:11,940
distant standpoint while still integrating some emotionally based reasoning. It's a blessing and

264
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:16,660
a curse. However, with that said, when I started this new style and began obtaining success,

265
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:20,820
I definitely still experienced an excitement for the first eight months or so. When a video

266
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:26,340
performed well, I got a rush from what I was experiencing. However, after a while, that began

267
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:30,100
to wear off, maybe due to the fact that you gradually become desensitized to these things

268
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:34,660
after they happen on a regular basis, but also likely because I was aware that with more people

269
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:39,460
watching you, there's a greater responsibility to deliver content that represents the brand that

270
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:43,700
a lot of you guys watch me for. As you grow your channel, there's more to lose on a mistake,

271
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:48,500
it's a lot of pressure to deliver that content all the time, and on occasion I've failed to

272
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:53,300
make it to a standard that I'll be happy with and it'll play on my mind. I'll go into more detail

273
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:57,540
regarding that soon, but every upload is a lot of pressure, that thought that there's been some

274
00:23:57,540 --> 00:24:01,700
glitch that you didn't pick up, some comment that you made being read a different way,

275
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:07,220
some misunderstanding that you've made, and those are valid concerns because I've made all of those

276
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:12,820
mistakes in my videos. Am I paranoid? Probably, but when you're talking about drama, you're never

277
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:17,220
too far away from it. On top of that, it's a lot to emotionally restrain yourself when there's

278
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:21,940
parts of me encouraging to absolutely let loose on people who come at you. There's still a part

279
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:25,940
of me that wants to respond to everyone and everything, but once you reach a certain point,

280
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:30,100
you realise that there's a lot of realism you have to apply. I think one of the other things is that

281
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:34,580
when a lot of people become popular, they often adapt a different mindset, because when you have

282
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:39,700
so much of your life at the public's disposal, you kinda have to take a different approach to it.

283
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:44,500
For me though, I feel that it's a necessity that my content requires grounding from the eyes of the

284
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:48,900
audience, which means I can never really become particularly invested in my own success, because

285
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:53,540
I worry that it would probably inflate my ego to the point where I lose touch with the perspectives

286
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:59,140
that I want to relay in my content. Just look at the Slazo video. These are all things that cause

287
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:03,700
a strong amount of pressure, which brings me to another very popular question that people ask me,

288
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:08,740
how do these serious topics affect my mental state? And to be honest, it's difficult to describe,

289
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:13,140
because for me, although the details obviously cause a level of repulsion, there's a part of me

290
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:17,780
that is just determined to push through and make sure that the content is delivered regardless of

291
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:22,660
what I find. I guess I do feel an element that takes its toll, but I also want to talk about

292
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:26,740
these things, the really sensitive topics sometimes, such as Etika, where no one had really

293
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:31,700
said anything the way that I wanted to. I guess my philosophy has always been what doesn't kill you

294
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:35,780
makes you stronger, and although that's not exactly true, and I'll be more than happy to tell you that,

295
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:40,660
I do find that experience grants one an element of mental immunity, although I'm not sure what the

296
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:45,620
cost of that has been. One of my former friends who I even collaborated with has managed to become

297
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:51,620
popular off the Minecraft resurgence, and I couldn't be happier for him, but part of me feels like

298
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:58,900
I could have made this easier for myself, I haven't chosen the easier path. My child's

299
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:02,900
development has not been without its flaws, some people reached out to me with these problems,

300
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:07,620
some I agree with and pledge to work on, others I disagree with and accept it's probably a

301
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:12,500
difference of opinion that separates us. I think probably my greatest challenge is making sure I

302
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:17,860
provide an analysis that separates observation from my own personal opinion, even though my videos

303
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:22,500
come out after a while, I still have to be considerate of the facts around the case changing, and keep an

304
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:28,580
open mind and be sympathetic to possible conditions that may yield it. I have biases, I will probably

305
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:34,020
always have biases, I am human, but I can still do better, and I need to avoid biases like those

306
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:38,500
which state that just because circumstances dictate something is likely doesn't mean it's certain,

307
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:43,940
and I need to emphasise that, but not necessarily compromise on the criticism that I want to deliver.

308
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:48,900
An example of where I failed on that was the ProJared video, which I unlisted a while back but

309
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:54,180
never really got round to talking about why, and although I have my criticisms, I was far too harsh

310
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:58,660
and channeled too many personal frustrations about responses rather than being sympathetic to

311
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:03,940
possible explanations and circumstances. I also missed details that would've altered my perspective,

312
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:08,900
and that's not good enough, I am sorry about that. A lot of people asked if I'd make a new version of

313
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:13,860
the video, but in the end I just didn't feel happy trying to redo it, I have very conflicted feelings

314
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:19,460
on the whole situation and his video. It wouldn't feel right to me picking through the topic with

315
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:26,100
a level of distance and superiority knowing that I could've done better myself. I didn't feel

316
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:30,580
comfortable putting myself in that position at that point, so I think sometimes you have to take

317
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:37,700
the L, move on, and take it as a learning experience. Talking about moving on, we'll slide over to a new topic.

318
00:27:49,460 --> 00:28:10,260
Another question that I received a lot is regarding the process I make my videos with,

319
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:14,740
how do I end up releasing these videos on a regular basis? It reminded me of a comment left

320
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:20,420
on my video that an editor sent me once, which basically said, so all you do is write an essay?

321
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:26,020
Listen mate, I wish it was that easy. Let's talk about how I make my videos. Firstly, it's picking

322
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:30,660
a topic. I have a google doc which lists all the possible topics that I could undertake. It's a

323
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:35,540
long list, a lot of people ask me if I run out of topics, and I can definitely say that's not really

324
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:39,540
a problem with me. With all these communities on YouTube, there's seldom a time when there isn't

325
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:44,020
something to talk about. I like to think that my style can always bring something new even if it's

326
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:48,340
a heavily visited topic. I think there's a lot of flexibility in what I can cover fortunately,

327
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:52,340
and that provides me with a broader range of situations to cover, so once I've picked a topic

328
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:57,860
I'll typically begin some research, and at that point a lot of people ask me how I do that. Well,

329
00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:02,340
I don't do anything particularly special, I use Google, YouTube, Twitter, Advanced Search,

330
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:07,140
Web Archive, and if there are any search engines specific to a certain site then obviously I'll

331
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:13,940
use them too. I have a few secret formulas that I keep to myself, but overall it's nothing magical.

332
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:18,420
A lot of searching, lots of clicking, one link that will lead to another link, and then maybe

333
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:22,820
another link, I think it's just a case of tenacity and working through fatigue that you might

334
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:28,340
experience. The research at first though is not too heavy, I do not do it all at once. Often I'll

335
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:33,540
work in research as I do my scripts, it's like a learning process for me as much as it is with

336
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:38,740
my audience, so you can see the evolution of my ideas and opinions throughout the video.

337
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:44,180
Some people ask if my opinions evolve too much during the research of a topic, and generally

338
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:49,220
they don't, mainly because I avoid assuming too much. I guess the one that I kind of changed my

339
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:53,860
opinion on was Oxhorn, I remember when I first looked into that, I hit a few videos that didn't

340
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:59,060
really convince me, and I even watched Oxhorn's response video, and I think around three videos

341
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:03,380
in when someone actually showed some evidence that my mind was swayed to be slightly more

342
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:08,420
skeptical of how he handled himself. Generally speaking though, I don't find my expectations

343
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:12,900
too easily subverted, obviously when the James Charles case went down, I was swayed one way,

344
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:17,060
and then swayed back the other, but that was all kind of happening in real time, so it's hard to

345
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:22,500
exactly compare it to other stories. When I'm writing, as said, there's an element of spontaneity

346
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:27,460
to it, a lot of people ask how I approach scripting, and for me I always say it is written

347
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:31,940
quite like an essay, but I use a lot of rhetorical devices that would typically be absent from a

348
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:37,140
written piece. I often imagine how I would say it in person, I may even repeat myself out loud when

349
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:41,460
reading through the script to make sure it flows relatively naturally, obviously these things aren't

350
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:45,860
completely perfect, but generally I think they flow quite smoothly with my approach. Once I'm

351
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:50,820
happy with the script, I will go into the recording studio, which is right now the cloak room in my

352
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:55,620
house, though I am working on another room to hopefully make that a bit easier. I take a stool,

353
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:59,220
put a load of cushion so I'm at a good angle with my microphone on the desk,

354
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:04,820
and I get going. It's not the most convenient, but we make it work. I know that's why my audio

355
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:09,940
can be a tad inconsistent, and some people with sensitive ears will pick it up, so once I have

356
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:14,260
a more solid studio hopefully that'll ease the issue. I often record it in one sitting,

357
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:18,180
though because I'm rather pedantic I will often make changes to these scripts because I'm never

358
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:22,580
satisfied. I'll go back and redo lines, and send them through to the editors with caveats,

359
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:26,420
I use strikethrough for text that I want to remove, and bold text for the script that I

360
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:31,060
want to add. After the audio is cut, I send it to the editors for visuals, I get a lot of questions

361
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:35,460
about the hiring of editors, but really it's just people contacting me, me seeing it, and then

362
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:40,900
initiating a discussion. I have an idea of what I like in my head, but I allow diversity, I think

363
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:45,220
it could make the video more colourful, even if it's not to everyone's taste. I will sometimes

364
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:50,260
split edits tactically, maybe if I feel one editor is more suited to one part. I typically split my

365
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:55,620
audios into 5-7 minute segments, so there's some way that it can be followed. My editors tend to

366
00:31:55,620 --> 00:32:00,020
do their own thing with some guidance, they also pick up various character stills, which,

367
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:04,340
if you are an artist, I've decided to create a crediting list for these videos, so please

368
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:09,300
contact me if your stills are being used in these videos. However, the work doesn't end there,

369
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:14,100
first I need to write up a reference list for the editors, I learned this fairly early on in

370
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:18,820
my career that this was necessary or else you're not going to see what you envision to be on the

371
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:23,540
screen, and I liked showing relevant footage for the topics that I discuss. That's also at the

372
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:28,180
reference sheet that you guys see if you've ever looked for them in the pinned comment, I used to

373
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:32,500
put them directly in the pinned comment, but I had situations where I was posting them, and I guess

374
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:36,820
the comment was too long or YouTube didn't like it, so in the end I just put them in another

375
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:41,540
document and left the link in the pinned comment. I'll do references, and provided I don't make too

376
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:46,180
many changes, I will receive people's versions, at that point I'll have another editor compile

377
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:50,420
these versions, and then send it over to me. Now the first draft often isn't perfect,

378
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:54,740
I've either forgotten to add something, an editor's misinterpreted a direction,

379
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:58,980
either of us could've made mistakes. So what happens is that either I'll have an editor

380
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:03,140
for post make the correction, or I'll have the original editor make the correction themselves,

381
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:07,140
sometimes an editor will want to make the change to their own part for the sake of continuity,

382
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:10,980
sometimes they're rather indifferent, sometimes we've had communication issues on this,

383
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:15,460
but overall I like to think we do it alright. I'm really proud of the progress and how many

384
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:20,500
editors have managed to keep up as the style has evolved, and I think that's something to celebrate.

385
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:26,180
The viewers times we've gone over a video is twice, but sometimes we've gone over it

386
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:31,460
six or seven times, and then come to release. Obviously I've got uploads, normally I try and

387
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:36,500
get the video review for monetisation pre-upload, it's very important due to the resources that I'm

388
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:40,740
already sinking into these videos, and I often don't trust YouTube to keep it monetised post

389
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:45,220
released. There was a pretty rough patch last year with monetisation around the time of the

390
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:50,100
Matt Watson drama, but since then it's been okay, I don't tend to do too much with the metadata,

391
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:55,220
I used to do more, but in hindsight I don't think it has a huge stake in the performance of videos.

392
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:59,300
I put the video intro into the description sometimes, seems like a nice little touch,

393
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:03,460
and it might help out with the search algorithm. We'll try and get a nice thumbnail,

394
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:07,620
almost all my thumbnails have come from the man himself, Starfo, although grade A under-ray part

395
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:14,020
2 was done by my main man Linuski, and around three weeks after we began, we upload, and I

396
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:18,420
anxiously anticipate that hopefully I haven't missed a glaring issue. One of the times where

397
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:23,380
that annoyingly happened was my Austin Jones video, although a piece I'm obviously very proud of.

398
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:29,380
Around the 35 minute mark you can hear this very high pitched background noise, which continues

399
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:34,340
until around the 40 minute mark if I recall correctly. That was pretty frustrating, so to

400
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:38,900
have to proof watch all these videos multiple times can be a task, and sometimes my friends

401
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:43,060
will watch it for me. Obviously there are some changes that they cannot advise on, but they'll

402
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:47,860
typically pick up if there are any glitches. The behaviour of uploads is strange, I'm a bit

403
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:51,940
pedantic, and therefore that leads to indecision over things like titles, which you may have seen

404
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:56,500
me change in the past mid-upload, and I do apologise if anyone has been confused into

405
00:34:56,500 --> 00:35:01,700
thinking I've uploaded a new video. Honestly, I sometimes feel slightly uncertain about stuff,

406
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:06,500
but we made it this far, and I think that'll lead me to my next parts.

407
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:17,220
A lot of people ask me what my plans are, how all of my previous plans have proceeded,

408
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:21,540
and I have talked about my personal ideas in previous videos, so I appreciate people

409
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:26,740
keeping me focused on them. Obviously I spoke about the progress with the podcast and so on,

410
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:31,140
but there's a load of other stuff. I heard a fair few questions about music,

411
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:36,020
and although I've probably mentioned this before, my favourite artists are Elton John, Queen, Robbie

412
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:41,540
Williams, ELO, that sort of vibe. I'm into a large majority of genres, providing it's not too loud or

413
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:46,420
aggressive, or lacking a structure that I myself enjoy, which is a pretty conventional one,

414
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:51,220
apologies to all you metalheads. Nonetheless, that's not the crux of the question, because

415
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:55,540
as some of you may know, I'm a trained vocalist. In fact, back in an older video,

416
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:58,980
the legendary TikTok predator, I wanted to do a music clip.

417
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:06,660
Whatever happened to the love that we used to send?

418
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:12,660
Whatever happened to the time I could be the one you could depend?

419
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:17,940
Whatever happened to the time we used to spend?

420
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:24,580
Together, I thought this was forever, now it's way till the end.

421
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:29,140
Because I didn't want to be claimed, I decided that I would use one of my own songs,

422
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:34,580
which is Until The End by Jaydance, though I think on Spotify it's called Waiting For The End.

423
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:39,540
I made the song when I was 16, I've always had a bit of an if melodies, and my other song of

424
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:43,460
That One Morning Sun is quite popular with the people I've shared it with. I'm definitely

425
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:47,940
planning on doing more music this year, but I probably need more time and resources to

426
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:53,300
dedicate to that hustle. The final goal is an album, but I'd like to feel like I have creative

427
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:57,860
control, and that's not something that I quite have yet. I'd love to maybe drop a little demo,

428
00:36:57,860 --> 00:37:02,100
and then use it to maybe build a platform off. When I started, the initial plan was to use this

429
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:06,980
as a platform to hopefully launch some of my other media-oriented careers, but at the same time,

430
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:11,780
I'm not sure at which point I should attempt to launch it. I'm actually working on a few rap tracks

431
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:16,420
with an editor and friend by the name of Cold, if you follow my Instagram you may have heard a clip

432
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:20,980
from one of them, it's a fun thing to do, and though I'm not expecting it of any great success,

433
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:27,460
it would be pretty cool. Regarding other media, I have a load of film ideas, I recently started

434
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:31,620
a document where I write them all down, one of the things I've always wanted to do is to

435
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:36,180
screenwrite and direct a film. As mentioned earlier, I had considered agreeing it at one

436
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:40,820
point, but thought it was too risky. I don't have too much formal training, but I do like to think

437
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:45,540
that I would be in touch with human conflicts that could drive my plots and dialogue, though

438
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:50,420
I'm not sure if that's enough for such a challenge. I would really like to consider it

439
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:55,300
at one point, but for now I guess I'll just leave it on the back burner. I did make a parody movie

440
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:57,860
with my friends, maybe you guys will see it one day.

441
00:37:57,860 --> 00:38:24,260
A truly classic clip, my ultimate goal is creative media, I cannot lie, but you also gotta be realistic

442
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:28,260
sometimes, you can't just waltz in and declare yourself the next Laurence Olivier, you have to

443
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:34,340
prove your worth in such a cutthroat industry, so I don't hold out hope, any success there will be

444
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:39,140
a pleasant surprise. Relating to this channel, obviously I hope I can be more ambitious, maybe

445
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:43,700
try and integrate a sense of self into some of my videos, there are also some burning issues that have

446
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:49,220
been on my mind relating to YouTube that I want to talk about, however I feel like a facecam character

447
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:54,180
break would be a good way to do them. Back when H3 did their YouTube callout videos, it's a shame

448
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:58,900
they don't do them anymore, it's not like people have fewer bones to pick with YouTube, and even

449
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:03,220
other transpiring situations that I don't feel comfortable with my current format would be good

450
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:07,780
to talk about too, however I don't want to commit to too much, because it is quite a nerve-wracking

451
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:12,900
thought for me. I also get a lot of political questions, whether I'm gonna go back into politics,

452
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:17,380
and although I addressed this in my previous Q&A, I guess I'm prepared to talk about it briefly here.

453
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:22,500
I have considered trying political content again, not on this channel, but maybe starting up another

454
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:27,220
channel where I do more live footage, content talking about politics, maybe integrated with some

455
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:32,580
creative ideas that would allow me to try out some of my cinematic tendencies. However, as a lot of

456
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:37,540
people have noted, it's a really toxic environment, and I'm not sure I'm mentally ready to do something

457
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:42,820
like that. Politically, there are no creators out there that fully represent how I feel. I'm not

458
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:47,860
right-wing, I like a lot the leftist guys, and that's how I identify, but some of the communities

459
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:54,580
seriously concern me with their strange drive for ideological purity, and I'll be honest, I'm not

460
00:39:54,580 --> 00:40:00,340
pure, I'm not perfect, and I'm not out here to let angry people affect my political views.

461
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:05,540
I'm not gonna have what I believe in be based on tone policing, but if I ever did politics again,

462
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:10,340
I doubt I would try and be part of a greater political community. I'm not here to tell others

463
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:15,540
how to feel or how to handle their grievances with a broken system, but I've just never had

464
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:21,620
the personal ability to be that vitriolic to people with differing opinions within reason,

465
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:26,900
and I feel I'd be dead by 25 if I took that mentality. I might be anyway, but I at least gotta

466
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:32,340
try and take care of myself. As for other channels, yeah, I have a few projects in the mixer, I'm setting

467
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:37,140
up a Twitch channel, and that would be pretty swell. I might have a highlights channel, as said,

468
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:41,220
when I see some of my friends having such a good time, I feel like I should try and get in on this

469
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:46,340
as well, although obviously I'll be doing my own thing. I'm also setting up some side projects,

470
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:52,020
lower pressure, less dramatic things, maybe even some very light entertainment. I don't expect it

471
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:56,580
to affect my upload schedule, I can work quite efficiently where I need to, and to be honest,

472
00:40:56,580 --> 00:41:00,580
I think the chaos is dying down for the start of the year, and I'm prepared to take it on.

473
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:05,540
If you hear my voice on another channel, don't be fazed that I'm doing something that you might not

474
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:10,500
expect me to do. Then there's merch, I receive a few questions about that, I am doing merch soon,

475
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:15,780
I've been beta testing some products, I'm gonna be releasing this really nice twat mug which reveals

476
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:21,940
itself when heated, that's one thing that I actually actively like, which is a rarity. I also

477
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:27,060
have this white text on black hoodie which reads too much free time for all you people out there

478
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:31,940
who feel the vibe. The other thing that I'm trying to do a tad more are sponsorships, as I'm still

479
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:36,180
rather cagey on YouTube's monetisation policy and the fact that they could change tomorrow.

480
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:40,420
There's never a feeling of security in anything that you earn, but the whole drama with better

481
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:44,820
help really switched me off, and since then I've only done two sponsorships. The latter was

482
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:49,540
obviously the raid one, which was great fun, because they let me and the internet historian

483
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:54,820
take the piss, but I wanna do some sponsorships where I can go in and say this brand is actually

484
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:59,460
really good. However, on top of that, I actually want to use sponsor slots as a way to platform

485
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:03,540
other creators, with the assurance of giving them a cut of the money made through that as well,

486
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:07,380
it'll give them some space to show off their creative abilities and sell themselves,

487
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:11,940
as well as the product, so although it's gonna take me a while to probably sort this out,

488
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:16,580
that's another idea that's been playing on my mind. I also have a few other things I want to

489
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:21,780
talk about too, and some other casual questions that I'll be happy to respond to, so let's go there right now.

490
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:29,060
It's time to clean up some of the questions here and there, that I wasn't sure quite how to fit in.

491
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:32,820
A fairly regular question has been about topics, obviously I explained how I pick them,

492
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:37,380
and my process, but I do get questions about these sorts of topics. I want to keep this channel's main

493
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:42,260
focus on YouTube topics, I will probably push the boat out here and there, I have a plan for

494
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:47,380
collab where I talk about a TV show for example, but there'll be more treats of sorts, and they still

495
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:52,260
talk about similar dynamics. I may make another channel where I occasionally post videos about

496
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:56,900
less YouTube related topics, there has been one very highly requested topic that I don't really

497
00:42:56,900 --> 00:43:00,900
want to cover on this channel, but it has my attention given certain details which have piqued

498
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:06,420
my interest. I do feel my channel works for a certain type of video, and I'm still coming to grips

499
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:10,900
with which ones work best. A few times I've spoken about predators and their behaviour,

500
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:16,580
and since then I've often received messages from people about others doing some very terrible

501
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:21,540
things, often criminal, and asking me if I would expose them, and often that stuff makes me very

502
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:26,100
nervous, and I typically suggest that it's referred to criminal authorities first. It's why I've become

503
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:30,420
a lot more tentative when people are offered to send me evidence privately, I take preference to

504
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:35,620
talking about what's out there already right now. Some people ask me about my branding and what I

505
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:40,420
consider myself to be, and I don't like to make too many comments because although it's a cliche,

506
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:44,500
I like to be myself and let people interpret what they think of me, whether that means they think

507
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:50,340
I'm a commentator, an entertainer, a philosopher, an investigator, or a dickhead, so be it. I don't

508
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:55,300
run any specific algorithm in my head for how I create my content, obviously I have methods,

509
00:43:55,300 --> 00:44:00,100
but I never really think about what I can do and what specific reaction it may provoke,

510
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:04,740
but I guess that brings me to my next point about advice that I would give to people, and I never

511
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:09,140
really say too much generally speaking, because the formula will always differ depending on the

512
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:14,500
person, but I guess the best thing that I would say to a creator is to ask yourself, why would a

513
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:19,220
viewer want to watch your content as opposed to other creators on the platform, and I think that's

514
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:23,700
a good question because it was the one detail I often overlooked when making my earlier content,

515
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:28,900
I never left an impact. When I ask that question, I don't mean it to discourage anyone or play on

516
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:34,100
their insecurities, but more to stimulate them to think about how they can innovate their brand

517
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:39,220
and carve out their own niche, and I think that's my other point, try not to be dissuaded by the

518
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:44,420
fact that some people won't enjoy what you're doing, everyone has different tastes, try not

519
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:49,940
to take it too personally, even if they try and make it personal. A lot of questions about dating

520
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:55,060
and a few people asking me out, calling me cute, which I'm very flattered by, I think that's one

521
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:59,860
of the things about YouTube life, it has definitely made it harder for dating. I've had two formal

522
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:04,340
dates in the last year, they were both nice, but in the end it just became impractical when I'm

523
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:09,780
still so restless. There are a lot of online ships, and I'd be lying if I didn't say I catch feelings,

524
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:15,460
but it's complicated. I'm a person with very high walls, and I'm unsure how involved with YouTube

525
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:21,220
I'd want my spouse to be. It's lonely, and I'm lonely, but you can't force these things.

526
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:25,220
I also have a lot of identity questions that I've never really got the chance to think about because

527
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:30,500
my life has been so hectic, and I want to resolve some of them before I can commit to someone else,

528
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:35,860
who may fall in love with someone I don't feel I really am. A lot of people ask me what my type is,

529
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:40,820
and I don't like to say too much, but I like people who I describe as energetic introverts,

530
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:45,700
there's an element of reservation but a shade of optimism too. I think I need that balance in my

531
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:51,620
life, I think I need someone stable to provide some security and ease my paranoia. My celebrity

532
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:57,620
crush would be Tom Holland I suppose, so if you want a general idea of what I'm into appearance-wise,

533
00:45:57,620 --> 00:46:03,300
well there it is, but there's flexibility on those fronts. Some people ask what I do to try and relax,

534
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:08,820
emphasis on the try there. I like sports, I play some squash to mainly maintain fitness,

535
00:46:08,820 --> 00:46:13,380
I'd like to do more football, or soccer, as you may call it, in fact, I think I'm pretty good in a

536
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:17,700
wing-bat position. However, I suffer from these nerve problems in my arms which make it more

537
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:22,580
difficult to participate in such activities, really bad pins and needles, and no one knows

538
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:26,820
exactly what to do about them, although I've had a couple appointments here and there and attempts

539
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:32,260
to alleviate it. I obviously enjoy music, and I spoke about that, I also enjoy cinema, you guys

540
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:36,580
probably know my favourite movie as Hot Fuzz, but if you're more interested in following my film

541
00:46:36,580 --> 00:46:42,420
taste you can check out my Letterboxd. I like TV shows, I'm currently watching Fargo and Better

542
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:48,260
Call Saul with my family, both pretty epic, I like them. I also enjoy quizzing, for people who know me

543
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:53,540
I have a bit of an obsession with the acquisition of information, and that can be seen in pub quizzes.

544
00:46:53,540 --> 00:46:58,260
I would really like to go on a game show, so if there are any game show executives watching this

545
00:46:58,260 --> 00:47:04,740
video, hey, hit me up, I have applied a fair few times. The final goal is to win Who Wants To Be

546
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:09,300
A Millionaire. I don't know if I'll ever have the opportunity, but a boy can dream, eh?

547
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:14,020
As for YouTube, the creators that I watch, I watch Todd and the Shadows, Billboard Breakdown

548
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:19,620
by Spectrum, Pulse, I Hate Everything, Internet Historian, Pyrocynical, Mr. Gigi, obviously The

549
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:26,020
Boys, Primink, J. Aubrey, Average Pixel, all those beautiful lads, I could go on. If there's a topic

550
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:30,180
that captures my interest, then I'll probably watch the video, providing I don't actually dislike the

551
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:34,420
creator's content. An interesting question is about who I really want to collaborate with, and that's

552
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:39,060
a difficult one, because I can collaborate with a lot of people who I haven't yet that are pretty

553
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:43,940
obvious, and I could just say, you know, Primink, and obviously you guys would know that completely,

554
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:49,140
so I guess I can throw a curveball in there, one person who I think would be cool is Pyrocynical.

555
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:52,660
He's always been really pleasant, treats me like an individual, remembers details that

556
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:57,300
I don't remember telling him, so that would be good. I haven't really had much contact though, as

557
00:47:57,300 --> 00:48:02,100
he's wise enough to stay off social media. A lot of people have asked me about alternative career

558
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:06,260
paths, if YouTube packed up tomorrow, what I'd do, and I think that's a hard question. I'd really

559
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:10,900
like to politics again, I'm very interested in local politics, I recently rejoined my local

560
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:15,380
liberal Democrat party because I feel like there are still a lot of local issues that matter to me.

561
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:20,180
I walk down the street, and the town is just so depressing, and I feel like there's so much more

562
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:26,260
that can be done, but I also still don't know if I belong with them. Creative arts, of course,

563
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:30,260
who knows what would happen there. I always worry that my status as a YouTube commentator would

564
00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:35,300
prevent me from being accepted in other places, but I think maybe that's a bit more of my paranoia,

565
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:39,540
it's tiring stuff being this eccentric. I'm not sure if there are too many other questions that I

566
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:45,060
want to respond to now, obviously gotta save some for my next Q&A. I'll score some quick fire points,

567
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:50,100
my favourite colour is red, my favourite animals are probably dogs, I'd love to dye my hair silvery

568
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:56,100
white sometimes, thank you Franny, I'd marry them all and maybe kill them afterwards. I actually

569
00:48:56,100 --> 00:49:00,020
love Mario Kart and I will beat you at it, you were never allowed out of the basement, probably

570
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:06,420
Asda, bees are good, I am hydrated, and no I have not heard about Raid Shadow Legends, please tell me more.

571
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:13,140
Really? No. Oh, and my favourite video? Well, I guess it could be this one, it's refreshing and

572
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:17,140
different, I know I can't do them every day, but it allowed me to talk about things that are close

573
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:21,940
to me, and things that have been playing on my mind, hopefully you learned a bit too, but if you

574
00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:26,820
discount this one, probably Austin Jones, in spite of the annoying glitch. Thank you guys for watching,

575
00:49:26,820 --> 00:49:29,460
I'm The Right Opinion, and I'll see you in the next one.
