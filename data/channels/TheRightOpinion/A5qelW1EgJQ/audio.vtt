00:00.000 --> 00:19.800
Hello ladies and gentlemen, welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time,

00:19.800 --> 00:27.100
and boy oh boy, is this a video I've been waiting to do for a while. In fact, I had originally planned to do this as some 500k subscriber special,

00:27.100 --> 00:32.980
but alas, time flies, and so many events occurred at that time that it was impossible to find a place for this video,

00:32.980 --> 00:39.420
but now everything's opened up a tiny bit more, I'm feeling more comfortable to take the time to talk about, well, a lot.

00:39.420 --> 00:44.140
At one point, I'd also planned to make this a New Year's kinda thing, kinda resolution sort of vibe,

00:44.140 --> 00:49.500
but knowing how long these videos take, I think there's a reasonable chance that it's closer to next year by the time this video's out.

00:49.500 --> 00:55.100
That is, of course, a hilarious joke, though knowing how long it takes on my videos, you may well have believed it.

00:55.140 --> 01:00.340
Obviously, this is a minor instalment in the Troe catalogue, but I still think it's a necessary one.

01:00.340 --> 01:06.460
As implied in the title, there will be a Q&A that will hopefully provide you with a little more insight on the man behind the Avatar.

01:06.460 --> 01:13.700
I also have a fair few announcements to make, but first of all, I would love to spend some time thanking those who have helped me on this rather chaotic journey.

01:13.700 --> 01:18.900
The main party who has probably played the most prominent part in this advancement are of course the editors,

01:18.900 --> 01:23.620
now as you probably know, I have a fair few editors, so I'll be leaving them all in the pinned comment,

01:23.660 --> 01:30.620
however, I do want to give a few special mentions to individuals who have gone above and beyond the Call of Duty in the past few months in particular.

01:30.620 --> 01:33.980
It's hard to know exactly who to start with, but I'd like to mention Peter Day.

01:33.980 --> 01:40.220
He has worked around the clock with some of the toughest edits and post-edits, when other people haven't been quite able to follow through,

01:40.220 --> 01:45.140
he has been on call every time, no exception. The dude is a superhuman, and I can't understate that.

01:45.140 --> 01:50.180
We're going to be working on a new channel project together ourselves, and I can't wait to get that off the ground.

01:50.180 --> 01:56.340
I'd also like to give thanks to anyone who has helped post-edit on a regular basis, most notably to Linuski and Mullenax.

01:56.340 --> 02:02.180
If you've ever heard the Danganronpa music in the background, then I can tell you that was the product of Mullenax's magic.

02:02.180 --> 02:07.540
They're both also really talented editors on their own terms with incredibly distinctive styles, I love what they do,

02:07.540 --> 02:13.380
and all three of these beautiful people have been working with me for over a year, and I hope that we can continue working through this one.

02:13.380 --> 02:18.180
I'd also like to give a mention to people who have consistently delivered high quality edits on a regular basis.

02:18.180 --> 02:22.340
A large majority of my editors have, and we've all worked on improving throughout the year.

02:22.340 --> 02:26.260
It's good to slowly work to push the bar higher, and I hope I can match their quality.

02:26.260 --> 02:32.260
I also want to give a big shoutout to my Discord server, the admins, and the head admin, and furry, Derumasis.

02:32.260 --> 02:37.620
Many of you probably don't know that when I was starting off on YouTube, I ran Colossalist's crazy server for a bit,

02:37.620 --> 02:43.140
and it was an absolute nightmare. Discord has obviously made it easier to manage certain elements since then,

02:43.140 --> 02:47.460
but it's still a challenge, and when I was working on it, it was always tough to make a decision that I felt

02:47.460 --> 02:53.860
would represent the Discord owner in question, so if you see him, tell him he does an alright job, and that he's a furry.

02:53.860 --> 02:58.260
He loves to be told that he's a furry, guys. I'd also like to thank my Patreons for their support,

02:58.260 --> 03:02.180
it gives me a bit more security when talking about topics that may be sensitive.

03:02.180 --> 03:08.180
Obviously, I'm always paying money to others for their work on my videos, and so their contributions are a lifeline.

03:08.180 --> 03:15.700
I don't really plug my Patreon too much, I only mention it right at the end of the videos, and a lot of people tend to click off before that point.

03:15.700 --> 03:20.020
So the fact that some actively seek it out and involve themselves like that does mean a lot to me.

03:20.020 --> 03:27.300
I want to give a special mention to my $50 Patreons, Sumhala Baloo, Nico Deschamps, Caroline, Cole P Hennessy, and Hypercube,

03:27.300 --> 03:33.780
they are all doing a fantastic job, thank you so much, guys. Sumhala Baloo has been supporting for over a year now,

03:33.780 --> 03:39.620
which I just think is incredible, and I'd also like to give an extra special mention to Brandon Stanton,

03:39.620 --> 03:46.180
Christopher Kraz, and Be More Cool J, my $100 Patreons. Brandon, who once again has been donating for over a year now.

03:46.180 --> 03:52.020
I actually have never spoken to him, but if you are watching from afar, know that your generosity does not go unnoticed.

03:52.020 --> 03:57.540
I want to thank all my friends, YouTube and non-YouTube, you need both to maintain some semblance of sanity.

03:57.540 --> 04:02.180
It's been really cool building public bonds with fantastic creators like Primink and J Aubrey,

04:02.180 --> 04:06.740
which is the only time I plan on pronouncing his name correctly, it will be J Aubrey for eternity.

04:06.740 --> 04:14.260
I will be starting a podcast with our good friend Jon soon, and I'll leave a link in the pinned comment if you want to go and subscribe to it.

04:14.260 --> 04:19.620
I know a lot of people were anticipating a podcast with Primink too, and as much as I want that, we both really do,

04:19.620 --> 04:24.340
because our banter is uncontested. Unfortunately, he's got a few other issues to deal with first,

04:24.340 --> 04:29.300
but I'm confident we'll make it a real thing eventually. Beyond that, I have a load of fellow creators to thank,

04:29.300 --> 04:35.620
IHE, Colossal, anyone who got me started and promoted my work, and on top of that, I want to thank everyone

04:35.620 --> 04:40.580
I've had the pleasure of meeting at events, VidCon, Insomnia, all of them are really enlightening,

04:40.580 --> 04:45.300
and a reminder that at the end of the day, we're all human, even if we're behind a screen most of the time.

04:45.300 --> 04:50.020
Any viewers I've met at those events too, it's really cool, I actually do want to do more meetups,

04:50.020 --> 04:56.420
but I find them a bit daunting, I had a couple experiences that put me off, but overall, they've been really positive ones that I have had.

04:56.420 --> 05:00.740
So yeah, I've mentioned a lot of people, however, most importantly, I have you guys to thank,

05:00.740 --> 05:05.380
I want to thank you for your continued support, and I hope I can represent that in the best way possible.

05:05.380 --> 05:09.300
It's admittedly been an interesting year, and I'll go into more detail about that soon,

05:09.300 --> 05:14.740
but it's good to have some people who will pull you through regardless. Without stroking your ego too much,

05:14.740 --> 05:18.820
it's good to have an audience who are pretty constructive in how they respond, how they reach out,

05:18.820 --> 05:24.020
and even how they deliver criticism. I'm not perfect, and we'll probably talk about that more in the Q&A section,

05:24.020 --> 05:28.900
but someone messaged me saying that they really appreciated that in spite of my rather pessimistic outlook,

05:28.900 --> 05:34.740
I try and see the best in people. I don't think that would be possible without people around me who take a similar philosophy,

05:34.740 --> 05:40.420
I am truly grateful for that. For now, I think it's best we enter the Q&A section, because some of you people

05:40.420 --> 05:46.340
really want to find out more about me, to be honest. Well, there's a lot to discuss, so I suggest we get into it.

05:54.500 --> 05:59.220
Alright, so before we get into this, I'll make it clear that if you haven't watched my last Q&A,

05:59.220 --> 06:03.540
I don't tend to go from question to question, I tend to try and give overarching answers that

06:03.540 --> 06:07.460
hopefully satisfy general points of interest, though of course I'll show some examples of

06:07.460 --> 06:11.780
questions so it doesn't look like I'm conducting an interview of myself. I'd also stress that there

06:11.780 --> 06:16.420
are some things that I may not talk about again, because I already spoke about them in my previous

06:16.420 --> 06:21.300
Q&A, and I don't want to be merely repeating myself, though I probably will. There's still a lot to talk

06:21.300 --> 06:26.340
about though, a lot, because last time I made one of these, I wasn't too detailed. Today I'll be

06:26.340 --> 06:30.740
showing a bit more, and maybe throwing a little shade, so I hope you do enjoy that.

06:30.740 --> 06:37.300
I guess one of the questions that I receive a lot is why I started, and that's a complex story, which,

06:37.300 --> 06:41.860
if asked before, I probably didn't go into too much depth, I probably said something like,

06:41.860 --> 06:50.020
oh I was bored, which isn't entirely true, so let's do that now. We go back to 2015, I believe.

06:50.020 --> 06:55.460
I decided to take a gap year, mainly because I wasn't quite confident that I knew exactly what I

06:55.460 --> 06:59.700
wanted to do at university. Initially, I had applied for script writing, but I began to have

06:59.700 --> 07:04.020
cold feet that it would be a very difficult industry to infiltrate, so instead of taking any

07:04.020 --> 07:08.340
of the offers I had received, I decided to hang back and make some new applications.

07:08.340 --> 07:13.060
After a bit of rumination, I found a course at a prestigious university that suited my interest,

07:13.060 --> 07:18.900
and I decided to apply for that. I also had various backup offers, but once I set my mind

07:18.900 --> 07:24.740
on a goal, it's hard to turn it onto anything else. Nonetheless, it was a painful process,

07:24.740 --> 07:29.300
there are a few stages, and it ends in a final interview stage at the actual college,

07:29.300 --> 07:34.340
so obviously I had to submit my application, and then I had to take this test, which I vigorously

07:34.340 --> 07:38.660
revised for with one of my close friends, shout out to Cheyenne, you're a legend. That went well,

07:38.660 --> 07:43.460
and then I was invited to the university. Now, at this point, I probably had a false sense of

07:43.460 --> 07:48.740
security, because I'm quite good at interviews generally speaking, or at least I thought I was,

07:48.740 --> 07:53.140
and when I was there, I had such an incredible time, they make it an incredible time, they hold

07:53.140 --> 07:57.460
these events, make you feel part of their family. Looking back on it, they kinda led me on.

07:57.460 --> 08:02.980
Because of that, I began to envision my future a bit too keenly, I had an idea in my mind of where

08:02.980 --> 08:08.900
I wanted to be, I had my mind on the university experience, and I should've managed my expectations

08:08.900 --> 08:13.860
better, because it didn't work out, and I think when I found out was one of the first times that

08:13.860 --> 08:19.780
I just felt this emotional black hole swallowing me. When I received the test results, which you

08:19.780 --> 08:24.180
receive after their verdict for some reason, because they were pretty high, I decided to make

08:24.180 --> 08:29.620
an inquiry about what they felt I could've done better, and after just a month, they gave me this

08:29.620 --> 08:34.500
email. The assessing tutors thought you gave a good interview, but unfortunately, given the

08:34.500 --> 08:40.260
competition for places, they felt there were stronger candidates. Oh, really, I thought the

08:40.260 --> 08:48.180
tutors were purposely giving places to weaker candidates. I felt insulted. I had waited almost

08:48.180 --> 08:54.740
a month to basically be told, you lost because other people beat you. This was 2016 by the way,

08:54.740 --> 09:00.420
I should probably clarify that, we are now into 2016, and this kinda flipped my mentality on its

09:00.420 --> 09:05.540
head at the time, because I've always sought out the idea that I do need to improve, right the

09:05.540 --> 09:12.820
wrongs, and yet, I gave this so much of my all, and received such a vague answer regarding something

09:12.820 --> 09:20.260
I cared about so much. I felt like I didn't know what to do better, and neither did they, and I

09:20.260 --> 09:25.620
didn't like that feeling, and because of that, I felt like no matter how much I gave, I would never

09:25.620 --> 09:31.540
be good enough in other people's eyes, or my own eyes. I was having a rough time in life with

09:31.540 --> 09:37.300
General, I felt like a failure, I was an emotional mess who probably flipped out a few times, because

09:38.100 --> 09:43.140
plans in my head had fallen apart, I had a good family providing me security, but I didn't have much

09:43.140 --> 09:48.500
money, and I always wanted to do something that could change my life. Other career paths were cool,

09:48.500 --> 09:53.300
but they were also pretty risky, YouTube seemed like that medium that could work out with a small

09:53.300 --> 09:58.260
initial investment, and the idea you could make gradual progress while continuing to support

09:58.260 --> 10:04.580
yourself. A few of my friends were doing YouTube at the time as well, Ollie, Ram, Isaac, you know who

10:04.580 --> 10:09.220
you are, and they seemed to be having a good time, so I thought it'd be an interesting thing to throw

10:09.220 --> 10:13.300
myself into. I think at that point I needed something to take my mind away from various

10:13.300 --> 10:17.780
insecurities, and I also wanted to prove to myself that I was good enough. I'm a perfectionist, and

10:17.780 --> 10:23.060
for multiple reasons that I'm probably going to go into eventually, my life had felt less than

10:23.060 --> 10:27.860
perfect. I was inspired by creators such as I Hate Everything, Odessa Buckley, and music critics such

10:27.860 --> 10:32.740
as Todd in the Shadows. I based the persona on a rather British stereotype due to my demeanor, and

10:32.740 --> 10:38.580
of course the accent, which yes, it is real, I thought it was good branding at least. Obviously,

10:38.580 --> 10:43.380
when I started, I made quite different content to what I do today. A lot of the first videos focused

10:43.380 --> 10:48.500
on political commentary, quite casual but stinging criticism of the then incumbent Conservative Party

10:48.500 --> 10:53.220
and many of their policies, politics was something that I was highly passionate about at the time,

10:53.220 --> 10:57.780
and therefore I thought maybe mixing the genre of politics with short form commentary could work

10:57.780 --> 11:03.300
out. With the help from my friends Isaac, also now known as Viri, and Jack, I managed to put

11:03.300 --> 11:08.260
out a decent amount of content, however I wasn't particularly invested in the channel at the time.

11:08.260 --> 11:13.620
I just wanted to make some videos where I chatted about stuff. I still had a lot of friends, and we

11:13.620 --> 11:18.580
partook in various activities, for example we even went to Rome on the back of a few hundred quid that

11:18.580 --> 11:23.380
each of us had, and that was fun. There are vlogs of that trip online still, I'll leave them in the

11:23.380 --> 11:28.740
pinned comment if you wanna see some footage of me prior to this fun little hobby. For the first few

11:28.740 --> 11:34.020
months I didn't really see YouTube beyond that hobby that would maybe blow up if I was fortunate.

11:34.020 --> 11:39.140
That all changed when I started university, which is strange because I was expecting university to

11:39.140 --> 11:44.420
be the end of my YouTube career. I went to Amsterdam to keep it vague, and it didn't go well,

11:44.420 --> 11:51.700
it wasn't good on the basis that it was already a disappointing result in my head, and this was also

11:51.700 --> 11:56.980
in the wake of the very significant Brexit vote, and a fair few people at the college had taken it

11:56.980 --> 12:00.900
very personally. Now, I'm not particularly enthusiastic about Britain's withdrawal from

12:00.900 --> 12:05.460
the European Union, but if you have watched my old videos, in spite of my generally left political

12:05.460 --> 12:10.420
persuasion, you'll know that I'm a firm critic of the European Union, much of their procedure and

12:10.420 --> 12:16.740
structure. Go back half a century, and a lot of Eurosceptics were on the left, but by 2016 it was

12:16.740 --> 12:22.020
clearly associated with right-wing ideology, and I think a lot of people jumped to conclusions about

12:22.020 --> 12:28.660
my own views, and people were emotional. That sort of stuff happens. I'm not mad about it, but the

12:28.660 --> 12:34.100
consequences were not great, people saw a few critical Facebook posts and it spiralled. I tried

12:34.100 --> 12:38.740
to shake it off at the start of the year by really involving myself in various activities, but I think

12:38.740 --> 12:43.940
I gave up after a month and just receded onto the online world. Probably one of the most defining

12:43.940 --> 12:48.820
experiences was in the second week. I remember I had a few new friends around to watch a film on

12:48.820 --> 12:54.100
my TV, and I went to grab my laundry. I always did my laundry really late at night, because I hated

12:54.100 --> 12:58.180
taking my laundry there and finding all the washing machines occupied. Some other British

12:58.180 --> 13:02.580
freshman who had clearly been drinking too much with his friends ended up swearing at me in the

13:02.580 --> 13:08.660
street, and although I returned verbal fire, which was foolish, I felt very shaken. And following that,

13:08.660 --> 13:13.060
I felt always some distance from other students. I'm not gonna make myself out to be some kind of

13:13.140 --> 13:17.940
victim, but knowing you're being subjected to differing levels of judgement from people,

13:17.940 --> 13:22.420
and never knowing what they think about you, and knowing that people are talking about you behind

13:22.420 --> 13:27.940
your back, is isolating. At that point, I became more involved with the online world again. I'd

13:27.940 --> 13:33.380
work on ColossusCrazy's Discord server, I'd work on more videos, I think I aimed to get three a week

13:33.380 --> 13:38.340
at some point. A lot of them are videos that frankly I don't really remember, nor do I really

13:38.340 --> 13:42.900
want to remember, though I might have a more cynical memory than that which is warranted.

13:42.900 --> 13:47.460
However, as you know, that's not the content that I was making today. Let's talk about that then,

13:47.460 --> 13:48.580
and how I got here.

13:51.460 --> 13:57.540
So that's the question, how did I end up making what I do today from my very humble beginnings,

13:57.540 --> 14:01.700
and the evolution that has occurred, because you know, for a long time, I had been making

14:01.700 --> 14:06.740
short form videos relating to political topics, so I guess we have to tackle two more things.

14:06.740 --> 14:11.300
Why did I make my videos longer, and why do I not cover political topics anymore?

14:11.300 --> 14:17.060
Let's talk about my political evolution first, because my political journey was much like an arc.

14:17.060 --> 14:21.620
I spoke about this in my previous Q&A, but once again we have more time for the Tro-Law than

14:21.620 --> 14:27.380
previous, so since I've left university, I've felt less motivation to conceal my feelings and

14:27.380 --> 14:32.100
the drama that occurred. The first couple years had pushed me in various directions politically,

14:32.100 --> 14:37.060
the exposure to rather hostile individuals in Amsterdam definitely made me bitter to a cause

14:37.060 --> 14:41.860
that I previously identified with, and it had made me more outspoken in a way. It was a late

14:41.860 --> 14:47.060
stage rebellious period in my mind, and I didn't stay at Amsterdam, which is very important.

14:47.860 --> 14:53.060
That's a fun little story actually. In February 2017, I suffered from probably one of the worst

14:53.060 --> 14:57.700
illnesses that I'd ever had in my life. They never actually diagnosed it, but my temperature

14:57.700 --> 15:03.540
was soaring, I had jaundice, it was really nasty stuff, I lost a month of class, and I even went

15:03.540 --> 15:08.820
home for treatment. Because of this, I missed a significant number of courses, five if I recall.

15:08.820 --> 15:13.540
Now, for four of the courses, the tutors were highly accommodating, and allowed me to partake

15:13.540 --> 15:17.940
in any of the assessments that I had missed. However, there was this one class, of which I

15:17.940 --> 15:23.140
didn't have the best experience anyway, the tutor wasn't fond of my outspoken nature, and the

15:23.140 --> 15:28.020
feeling was mutual. I had missed the last week of lessons, which of course, wouldn't normally be a

15:28.020 --> 15:34.100
big deal, but because it was an intensive course, she insisted that I had to retake the whole 23

15:34.100 --> 15:39.620
lessons, an idea that I did not find palace ball, considering I'd been there for 19 lessons.

15:39.620 --> 15:44.740
So I appealed to the relevant academic board, who decided that actually, they wanted to support the

15:44.740 --> 15:48.900
tutor's decision. I assumed at first they were ill informed, and sent them all the relevant

15:48.900 --> 15:54.100
documentation, doctor's assessments, contributions, I even met with them, I offered compromises, even

15:54.100 --> 15:58.180
offering to retake the part of the course that I had missed. Even though I'd done the written

15:58.180 --> 16:04.180
assessment, the exam, and worked on part of the group project, they insisted that I had to do the

16:04.180 --> 16:09.060
whole thing again. In the end, I took it to the higher appeals board, and although I won the case

16:09.060 --> 16:14.340
against them on that level, I had attended a tribunal where I had to represent myself against

16:14.340 --> 16:21.060
my own academic board, and that was surreal, and it probably has shaped why I have very little trust

16:21.060 --> 16:25.940
in authority. It was undoubtedly the most stressful experience of my life, and at the time, it led to a

16:25.940 --> 16:31.140
lot of specific resentment towards the stereotype of what the typical liberal arts represented,

16:31.140 --> 16:36.020
leading to a lot of videos that probably served as the antithesis to the philosophy of their

16:36.020 --> 16:41.540
attitude. In hindsight, that wasn't the right way to deal with it, and the lesson that I should have

16:41.540 --> 16:47.540
learned was much broader than that. You can't rely on others to do the right thing for you, but in 2017,

16:47.540 --> 16:52.580
I was definitely at my most political, and it was not in the right way, I was ideologically channeling

16:52.580 --> 16:57.540
frustrations against an issue that was beyond ideology, which is why a lot of those videos just

16:57.540 --> 17:02.100
aren't up anymore. After this mess, I made a conscious decision to move to a different university.

17:02.100 --> 17:07.140
Now, I really didn't want to do this on principle, because I didn't want to lose the academic progress

17:07.140 --> 17:11.460
that I made throughout that year, but fortunately, the University of Groningen, also in the Netherlands,

17:11.460 --> 17:16.100
offered a straight transfer that allowed me to start in my second year, and that was a very

17:16.100 --> 17:20.900
different environment, which completely dissipated many of my frustrations that I had at the previous

17:20.900 --> 17:25.620
university. Now, let me make it clear, this wasn't without its problems, I had some issues when I

17:25.620 --> 17:31.220
started, but they weren't social. I go along with people fine, even though at that point, I dedicated

17:31.220 --> 17:36.180
a significant amount of time to my YouTube grind. I got drunk on many Saturday nights, made a fair

17:36.180 --> 17:41.220
few friends, big shout out to Sush You Mad Lad, if you're watching this. It took a few months,

17:41.220 --> 17:46.340
probably until January, February, but my opinion on these stereotypes in my head really began to

17:46.340 --> 17:50.740
soften, and I tried to diversify my content a little. I remember making a critical video on

17:50.740 --> 17:56.260
White Boy by Tom McDonald, and that just got absolutely swarmed with a mix of McDonald fans,

17:56.260 --> 18:01.380
and actual alt writers who, for some reason, weren't the nicest. You know they say there's always

18:01.380 --> 18:05.940
one video where you gotta have a negative like to dislike ratio, that was it. At that point,

18:05.940 --> 18:10.260
I had a policy of replying to nearly every comment that was made on my videos, but I have to admit

18:10.260 --> 18:14.900
my patience began to wither after that one. I realised that my brand of what I viewed as a

18:14.900 --> 18:19.140
gender-driven activism probably wasn't the healthiest for me, and that it often pushed

18:19.140 --> 18:24.420
me to one side of the debate, when really I wanted to think myself as quite an open-minded person.

18:24.420 --> 18:29.780
I think what I realised is that I was still politically naive to a lot of ideas that I had,

18:29.780 --> 18:34.900
where I stood, and there was this part of me that I wanted to figure that out, and that a YouTube

18:34.900 --> 18:39.540
channel where you post all your thoughts with some degree of confidence and conviction

18:39.540 --> 18:44.500
probably wasn't the best if you had changed your mind in a few years. However, I still wanted to

18:44.500 --> 18:49.300
make content that could involve me looking at situations, applying various levels of logic and

18:49.300 --> 18:54.340
reasoning, something that would challenge me, and at the time a lot of my friends were involved in

18:54.340 --> 18:59.460
commentary. In spite of my political narratives, I'd never really fit into any political clique,

18:59.460 --> 19:03.780
and no one had ever really invited me, which was fine, but because of that, the only reason that

19:03.780 --> 19:08.660
I made those videos was because of my own personal interest, my own attachment, I didn't

19:08.660 --> 19:14.980
have an obligation to anyone else. At around that time, early 2018, I also attended an Insomnia

19:14.980 --> 19:20.100
gaming festival, which was the first event that I attended as a YouTuber, and it inspired me to take

19:20.100 --> 19:25.700
the leap into commentary. However, I was aware of one thing, that there were a lot of commentators,

19:25.700 --> 19:30.500
and I'd made commentary videos in the past, and they hadn't done much. The most successful video

19:30.500 --> 19:35.460
I had made at that point was a video called Matt Hoss Could Win, and that seemed more like a fluke

19:35.460 --> 19:39.860
than anything else. So I realised that I had to do something unique, I had to leave an impact with

19:39.860 --> 19:44.980
my content, so I took a look at my resources and what I had going for me, I had relatively strong

19:44.980 --> 19:49.460
community standing, a persistent determination, some experience in writing, and a strong

19:49.460 --> 19:54.260
relationship with some very talented editors. So I thought, well, let's put it all together,

19:54.260 --> 19:59.220
make longer videos, videos with a more personal style, something that will set me apart in what

19:59.220 --> 20:04.580
I'm doing, and yet maintain a decent upload schedule, and so I began making videos in that

20:04.580 --> 20:08.820
style. This wasn't without its problems, and it still isn't, there are obviously going to be some

20:08.820 --> 20:13.620
inconsistencies in the visuals, and even though there is consistency, some people just can't get

20:13.620 --> 20:18.980
into that style of video, and I can't blame people if they don't like that approach. For me though,

20:18.980 --> 20:23.780
what I think is most important is that feeling of progress, that sentiment that I hope with regards

20:23.780 --> 20:28.260
to quality, my videos are moving forward. Obviously, that's subjective to an extent,

20:28.260 --> 20:32.180
but if you go back to my earlier videos in this format, and compare them with the ones that I'm

20:32.180 --> 20:36.660
doing today, I hope that there is some visible difference, and hopefully one that is for the

20:36.660 --> 20:42.340
better, but as said, it hasn't been without its challenges. Let's talk about that a bit more.

20:46.500 --> 20:51.060
One of the most significant burning questions that I've received from people is about the mental

20:51.060 --> 20:56.340
effect that such content has had on me, and it's a good question, one that is kind of difficult

20:56.340 --> 21:02.180
to respond to, but I'll do my best. It's not been great, no one said this stuff would be easy,

21:02.180 --> 21:07.700
and I embrace the challenge, but it's a large burden, and I guess this ties into the questions

21:07.700 --> 21:12.980
that I receive about maintaining some emotional distance from the topics. I've even had a few

21:12.980 --> 21:18.260
people ask me in the past if I'm a sociopath, which I'm definitely not, but I understand why

21:18.260 --> 21:22.660
someone may think that. To enter the topics with the level of emotional distance that I often do

21:22.660 --> 21:26.980
is difficult. I think trying to untie your personal feelings from these issues is something

21:26.980 --> 21:31.540
that many find too much of a challenge to do themselves, and it's a challenge that I don't

21:31.540 --> 21:37.380
always successfully traverse myself, but I guess I was set up for it in a way. When I was growing up,

21:37.380 --> 21:42.420
I was an emotional person, extremely emotional, I was very volatile, and my moods often swung from

21:42.420 --> 21:46.420
one pole to the other. I've always been very perceptive, so when I felt someone was being

21:46.420 --> 21:51.940
unfair, unreasonable, or vindictive, I was prone to being quite abruptly hostile. However, I came

21:51.940 --> 21:56.020
to realise that many people wouldn't often come around to your point of view through such an

21:56.020 --> 22:01.460
attitude, and that often you had to use other more restrained techniques. When I was around 12, I had

22:01.460 --> 22:05.300
anger management therapy, and this definitely improved me, and although I was still prone to

22:05.300 --> 22:10.980
making emotionally based and often rash decisions, in the next few years I continued to work on myself.

22:12.100 --> 22:16.260
Life was pretty good through a majority of my teenage years, but I think my gap year combined

22:16.260 --> 22:21.780
with my first year of university really fractured my mentality. There were a lot of times where I

22:21.780 --> 22:26.660
probably got too emotionally invested in my own expectations, which led to disappointment, and I

22:26.660 --> 22:32.420
think that sort of continuous cycle wears you down, and eventually my body just said no to heavy

22:32.420 --> 22:37.780
emotional investment, and excitement, and looking forward to things. And this isn't to say I don't

22:37.780 --> 22:43.060
still feel things because I do, but I often get this very weird dynamic where I experience more

22:43.060 --> 22:49.140
physical emotional reactions than what I feel inside. For example, sometimes I'll do karaoke,

22:49.140 --> 22:54.100
and I know it makes me very nervous, and although I won't feel nervous in my head, I'll experience

22:54.100 --> 22:59.860
the most terrible tremors. It feels like there's some emotional disconnect between how I feel and

22:59.860 --> 23:05.140
how my head tells me to feel, and this I think has allowed me to look at drama from a relatively

23:05.140 --> 23:11.940
distant standpoint while still integrating some emotionally based reasoning. It's a blessing and

23:11.940 --> 23:16.660
a curse. However, with that said, when I started this new style and began obtaining success,

23:16.660 --> 23:20.820
I definitely still experienced an excitement for the first eight months or so. When a video

23:20.820 --> 23:26.340
performed well, I got a rush from what I was experiencing. However, after a while, that began

23:26.340 --> 23:30.100
to wear off, maybe due to the fact that you gradually become desensitized to these things

23:30.100 --> 23:34.660
after they happen on a regular basis, but also likely because I was aware that with more people

23:34.660 --> 23:39.460
watching you, there's a greater responsibility to deliver content that represents the brand that

23:39.460 --> 23:43.700
a lot of you guys watch me for. As you grow your channel, there's more to lose on a mistake,

23:43.700 --> 23:48.500
it's a lot of pressure to deliver that content all the time, and on occasion I've failed to

23:48.500 --> 23:53.300
make it to a standard that I'll be happy with and it'll play on my mind. I'll go into more detail

23:53.300 --> 23:57.540
regarding that soon, but every upload is a lot of pressure, that thought that there's been some

23:57.540 --> 24:01.700
glitch that you didn't pick up, some comment that you made being read a different way,

24:01.700 --> 24:07.220
some misunderstanding that you've made, and those are valid concerns because I've made all of those

24:07.220 --> 24:12.820
mistakes in my videos. Am I paranoid? Probably, but when you're talking about drama, you're never

24:12.820 --> 24:17.220
too far away from it. On top of that, it's a lot to emotionally restrain yourself when there's

24:17.220 --> 24:21.940
parts of me encouraging to absolutely let loose on people who come at you. There's still a part

24:21.940 --> 24:25.940
of me that wants to respond to everyone and everything, but once you reach a certain point,

24:25.940 --> 24:30.100
you realise that there's a lot of realism you have to apply. I think one of the other things is that

24:30.100 --> 24:34.580
when a lot of people become popular, they often adapt a different mindset, because when you have

24:34.580 --> 24:39.700
so much of your life at the public's disposal, you kinda have to take a different approach to it.

24:39.700 --> 24:44.500
For me though, I feel that it's a necessity that my content requires grounding from the eyes of the

24:44.500 --> 24:48.900
audience, which means I can never really become particularly invested in my own success, because

24:48.900 --> 24:53.540
I worry that it would probably inflate my ego to the point where I lose touch with the perspectives

24:53.540 --> 24:59.140
that I want to relay in my content. Just look at the Slazo video. These are all things that cause

24:59.140 --> 25:03.700
a strong amount of pressure, which brings me to another very popular question that people ask me,

25:03.700 --> 25:08.740
how do these serious topics affect my mental state? And to be honest, it's difficult to describe,

25:08.740 --> 25:13.140
because for me, although the details obviously cause a level of repulsion, there's a part of me

25:13.140 --> 25:17.780
that is just determined to push through and make sure that the content is delivered regardless of

25:17.780 --> 25:22.660
what I find. I guess I do feel an element that takes its toll, but I also want to talk about

25:22.660 --> 25:26.740
these things, the really sensitive topics sometimes, such as Etika, where no one had really

25:26.740 --> 25:31.700
said anything the way that I wanted to. I guess my philosophy has always been what doesn't kill you

25:31.700 --> 25:35.780
makes you stronger, and although that's not exactly true, and I'll be more than happy to tell you that,

25:35.780 --> 25:40.660
I do find that experience grants one an element of mental immunity, although I'm not sure what the

25:40.660 --> 25:45.620
cost of that has been. One of my former friends who I even collaborated with has managed to become

25:45.620 --> 25:51.620
popular off the Minecraft resurgence, and I couldn't be happier for him, but part of me feels like

25:51.620 --> 25:58.900
I could have made this easier for myself, I haven't chosen the easier path. My child's

25:58.900 --> 26:02.900
development has not been without its flaws, some people reached out to me with these problems,

26:02.900 --> 26:07.620
some I agree with and pledge to work on, others I disagree with and accept it's probably a

26:07.620 --> 26:12.500
difference of opinion that separates us. I think probably my greatest challenge is making sure I

26:12.500 --> 26:17.860
provide an analysis that separates observation from my own personal opinion, even though my videos

26:17.860 --> 26:22.500
come out after a while, I still have to be considerate of the facts around the case changing, and keep an

26:22.500 --> 26:28.580
open mind and be sympathetic to possible conditions that may yield it. I have biases, I will probably

26:28.580 --> 26:34.020
always have biases, I am human, but I can still do better, and I need to avoid biases like those

26:34.020 --> 26:38.500
which state that just because circumstances dictate something is likely doesn't mean it's certain,

26:38.500 --> 26:43.940
and I need to emphasise that, but not necessarily compromise on the criticism that I want to deliver.

26:43.940 --> 26:48.900
An example of where I failed on that was the ProJared video, which I unlisted a while back but

26:48.900 --> 26:54.180
never really got round to talking about why, and although I have my criticisms, I was far too harsh

26:54.180 --> 26:58.660
and channeled too many personal frustrations about responses rather than being sympathetic to

26:58.660 --> 27:03.940
possible explanations and circumstances. I also missed details that would've altered my perspective,

27:03.940 --> 27:08.900
and that's not good enough, I am sorry about that. A lot of people asked if I'd make a new version of

27:08.900 --> 27:13.860
the video, but in the end I just didn't feel happy trying to redo it, I have very conflicted feelings

27:13.860 --> 27:19.460
on the whole situation and his video. It wouldn't feel right to me picking through the topic with

27:19.460 --> 27:26.100
a level of distance and superiority knowing that I could've done better myself. I didn't feel

27:26.100 --> 27:30.580
comfortable putting myself in that position at that point, so I think sometimes you have to take

27:30.580 --> 27:37.700
the L, move on, and take it as a learning experience. Talking about moving on, we'll slide over to a new topic.

27:49.460 --> 28:10.260
Another question that I received a lot is regarding the process I make my videos with,

28:10.260 --> 28:14.740
how do I end up releasing these videos on a regular basis? It reminded me of a comment left

28:14.740 --> 28:20.420
on my video that an editor sent me once, which basically said, so all you do is write an essay?

28:20.420 --> 28:26.020
Listen mate, I wish it was that easy. Let's talk about how I make my videos. Firstly, it's picking

28:26.020 --> 28:30.660
a topic. I have a google doc which lists all the possible topics that I could undertake. It's a

28:30.660 --> 28:35.540
long list, a lot of people ask me if I run out of topics, and I can definitely say that's not really

28:35.540 --> 28:39.540
a problem with me. With all these communities on YouTube, there's seldom a time when there isn't

28:39.540 --> 28:44.020
something to talk about. I like to think that my style can always bring something new even if it's

28:44.020 --> 28:48.340
a heavily visited topic. I think there's a lot of flexibility in what I can cover fortunately,

28:48.340 --> 28:52.340
and that provides me with a broader range of situations to cover, so once I've picked a topic

28:52.340 --> 28:57.860
I'll typically begin some research, and at that point a lot of people ask me how I do that. Well,

28:57.860 --> 29:02.340
I don't do anything particularly special, I use Google, YouTube, Twitter, Advanced Search,

29:02.340 --> 29:07.140
Web Archive, and if there are any search engines specific to a certain site then obviously I'll

29:07.140 --> 29:13.940
use them too. I have a few secret formulas that I keep to myself, but overall it's nothing magical.

29:13.940 --> 29:18.420
A lot of searching, lots of clicking, one link that will lead to another link, and then maybe

29:18.420 --> 29:22.820
another link, I think it's just a case of tenacity and working through fatigue that you might

29:22.820 --> 29:28.340
experience. The research at first though is not too heavy, I do not do it all at once. Often I'll

29:28.340 --> 29:33.540
work in research as I do my scripts, it's like a learning process for me as much as it is with

29:33.540 --> 29:38.740
my audience, so you can see the evolution of my ideas and opinions throughout the video.

29:39.300 --> 29:44.180
Some people ask if my opinions evolve too much during the research of a topic, and generally

29:44.180 --> 29:49.220
they don't, mainly because I avoid assuming too much. I guess the one that I kind of changed my

29:49.220 --> 29:53.860
opinion on was Oxhorn, I remember when I first looked into that, I hit a few videos that didn't

29:53.860 --> 29:59.060
really convince me, and I even watched Oxhorn's response video, and I think around three videos

29:59.060 --> 30:03.380
in when someone actually showed some evidence that my mind was swayed to be slightly more

30:03.380 --> 30:08.420
skeptical of how he handled himself. Generally speaking though, I don't find my expectations

30:08.420 --> 30:12.900
too easily subverted, obviously when the James Charles case went down, I was swayed one way,

30:12.900 --> 30:17.060
and then swayed back the other, but that was all kind of happening in real time, so it's hard to

30:17.060 --> 30:22.500
exactly compare it to other stories. When I'm writing, as said, there's an element of spontaneity

30:22.500 --> 30:27.460
to it, a lot of people ask how I approach scripting, and for me I always say it is written

30:27.460 --> 30:31.940
quite like an essay, but I use a lot of rhetorical devices that would typically be absent from a

30:31.940 --> 30:37.140
written piece. I often imagine how I would say it in person, I may even repeat myself out loud when

30:37.140 --> 30:41.460
reading through the script to make sure it flows relatively naturally, obviously these things aren't

30:41.460 --> 30:45.860
completely perfect, but generally I think they flow quite smoothly with my approach. Once I'm

30:45.860 --> 30:50.820
happy with the script, I will go into the recording studio, which is right now the cloak room in my

30:50.820 --> 30:55.620
house, though I am working on another room to hopefully make that a bit easier. I take a stool,

30:55.700 --> 30:59.220
put a load of cushion so I'm at a good angle with my microphone on the desk,

30:59.220 --> 31:04.820
and I get going. It's not the most convenient, but we make it work. I know that's why my audio

31:04.820 --> 31:09.940
can be a tad inconsistent, and some people with sensitive ears will pick it up, so once I have

31:09.940 --> 31:14.260
a more solid studio hopefully that'll ease the issue. I often record it in one sitting,

31:14.260 --> 31:18.180
though because I'm rather pedantic I will often make changes to these scripts because I'm never

31:18.180 --> 31:22.580
satisfied. I'll go back and redo lines, and send them through to the editors with caveats,

31:22.580 --> 31:26.420
I use strikethrough for text that I want to remove, and bold text for the script that I

31:26.420 --> 31:31.060
want to add. After the audio is cut, I send it to the editors for visuals, I get a lot of questions

31:31.060 --> 31:35.460
about the hiring of editors, but really it's just people contacting me, me seeing it, and then

31:35.460 --> 31:40.900
initiating a discussion. I have an idea of what I like in my head, but I allow diversity, I think

31:40.900 --> 31:45.220
it could make the video more colourful, even if it's not to everyone's taste. I will sometimes

31:45.220 --> 31:50.260
split edits tactically, maybe if I feel one editor is more suited to one part. I typically split my

31:50.260 --> 31:55.620
audios into 5-7 minute segments, so there's some way that it can be followed. My editors tend to

31:55.620 --> 32:00.020
do their own thing with some guidance, they also pick up various character stills, which,

32:00.020 --> 32:04.340
if you are an artist, I've decided to create a crediting list for these videos, so please

32:04.340 --> 32:09.300
contact me if your stills are being used in these videos. However, the work doesn't end there,

32:09.300 --> 32:14.100
first I need to write up a reference list for the editors, I learned this fairly early on in

32:14.100 --> 32:18.820
my career that this was necessary or else you're not going to see what you envision to be on the

32:18.820 --> 32:23.540
screen, and I liked showing relevant footage for the topics that I discuss. That's also at the

32:23.540 --> 32:28.180
reference sheet that you guys see if you've ever looked for them in the pinned comment, I used to

32:28.180 --> 32:32.500
put them directly in the pinned comment, but I had situations where I was posting them, and I guess

32:32.500 --> 32:36.820
the comment was too long or YouTube didn't like it, so in the end I just put them in another

32:36.820 --> 32:41.540
document and left the link in the pinned comment. I'll do references, and provided I don't make too

32:41.540 --> 32:46.180
many changes, I will receive people's versions, at that point I'll have another editor compile

32:46.180 --> 32:50.420
these versions, and then send it over to me. Now the first draft often isn't perfect,

32:50.420 --> 32:54.740
I've either forgotten to add something, an editor's misinterpreted a direction,

32:54.740 --> 32:58.980
either of us could've made mistakes. So what happens is that either I'll have an editor

32:58.980 --> 33:03.140
for post make the correction, or I'll have the original editor make the correction themselves,

33:03.140 --> 33:07.140
sometimes an editor will want to make the change to their own part for the sake of continuity,

33:07.140 --> 33:10.980
sometimes they're rather indifferent, sometimes we've had communication issues on this,

33:10.980 --> 33:15.460
but overall I like to think we do it alright. I'm really proud of the progress and how many

33:15.460 --> 33:20.500
editors have managed to keep up as the style has evolved, and I think that's something to celebrate.

33:21.620 --> 33:26.180
The viewers times we've gone over a video is twice, but sometimes we've gone over it

33:26.180 --> 33:31.460
six or seven times, and then come to release. Obviously I've got uploads, normally I try and

33:31.460 --> 33:36.500
get the video review for monetisation pre-upload, it's very important due to the resources that I'm

33:36.500 --> 33:40.740
already sinking into these videos, and I often don't trust YouTube to keep it monetised post

33:40.740 --> 33:45.220
released. There was a pretty rough patch last year with monetisation around the time of the

33:45.220 --> 33:50.100
Matt Watson drama, but since then it's been okay, I don't tend to do too much with the metadata,

33:50.100 --> 33:55.220
I used to do more, but in hindsight I don't think it has a huge stake in the performance of videos.

33:55.220 --> 33:59.300
I put the video intro into the description sometimes, seems like a nice little touch,

33:59.300 --> 34:03.460
and it might help out with the search algorithm. We'll try and get a nice thumbnail,

34:03.460 --> 34:07.620
almost all my thumbnails have come from the man himself, Starfo, although grade A under-ray part

34:07.620 --> 34:14.020
2 was done by my main man Linuski, and around three weeks after we began, we upload, and I

34:14.020 --> 34:18.420
anxiously anticipate that hopefully I haven't missed a glaring issue. One of the times where

34:18.420 --> 34:23.380
that annoyingly happened was my Austin Jones video, although a piece I'm obviously very proud of.

34:23.380 --> 34:29.380
Around the 35 minute mark you can hear this very high pitched background noise, which continues

34:29.380 --> 34:34.340
until around the 40 minute mark if I recall correctly. That was pretty frustrating, so to

34:34.340 --> 34:38.900
have to proof watch all these videos multiple times can be a task, and sometimes my friends

34:38.900 --> 34:43.060
will watch it for me. Obviously there are some changes that they cannot advise on, but they'll

34:43.060 --> 34:47.860
typically pick up if there are any glitches. The behaviour of uploads is strange, I'm a bit

34:47.860 --> 34:51.940
pedantic, and therefore that leads to indecision over things like titles, which you may have seen

34:51.940 --> 34:56.500
me change in the past mid-upload, and I do apologise if anyone has been confused into

34:56.500 --> 35:01.700
thinking I've uploaded a new video. Honestly, I sometimes feel slightly uncertain about stuff,

35:02.260 --> 35:06.500
but we made it this far, and I think that'll lead me to my next parts.

35:12.740 --> 35:17.220
A lot of people ask me what my plans are, how all of my previous plans have proceeded,

35:17.220 --> 35:21.540
and I have talked about my personal ideas in previous videos, so I appreciate people

35:21.540 --> 35:26.740
keeping me focused on them. Obviously I spoke about the progress with the podcast and so on,

35:26.740 --> 35:31.140
but there's a load of other stuff. I heard a fair few questions about music,

35:31.140 --> 35:36.020
and although I've probably mentioned this before, my favourite artists are Elton John, Queen, Robbie

35:36.020 --> 35:41.540
Williams, ELO, that sort of vibe. I'm into a large majority of genres, providing it's not too loud or

35:41.540 --> 35:46.420
aggressive, or lacking a structure that I myself enjoy, which is a pretty conventional one,

35:46.420 --> 35:51.220
apologies to all you metalheads. Nonetheless, that's not the crux of the question, because

35:51.220 --> 35:55.540
as some of you may know, I'm a trained vocalist. In fact, back in an older video,

35:55.540 --> 35:58.980
the legendary TikTok predator, I wanted to do a music clip.

35:58.980 --> 36:06.660
Whatever happened to the love that we used to send?

36:06.660 --> 36:12.660
Whatever happened to the time I could be the one you could depend?

36:12.660 --> 36:17.940
Whatever happened to the time we used to spend?

36:17.940 --> 36:24.580
Together, I thought this was forever, now it's way till the end.

36:24.580 --> 36:29.140
Because I didn't want to be claimed, I decided that I would use one of my own songs,

36:29.140 --> 36:34.580
which is Until The End by Jaydance, though I think on Spotify it's called Waiting For The End.

36:34.580 --> 36:39.540
I made the song when I was 16, I've always had a bit of an if melodies, and my other song of

36:39.540 --> 36:43.460
That One Morning Sun is quite popular with the people I've shared it with. I'm definitely

36:43.460 --> 36:47.940
planning on doing more music this year, but I probably need more time and resources to

36:47.940 --> 36:53.300
dedicate to that hustle. The final goal is an album, but I'd like to feel like I have creative

36:53.300 --> 36:57.860
control, and that's not something that I quite have yet. I'd love to maybe drop a little demo,

36:57.860 --> 37:02.100
and then use it to maybe build a platform off. When I started, the initial plan was to use this

37:02.100 --> 37:06.980
as a platform to hopefully launch some of my other media-oriented careers, but at the same time,

37:06.980 --> 37:11.780
I'm not sure at which point I should attempt to launch it. I'm actually working on a few rap tracks

37:11.780 --> 37:16.420
with an editor and friend by the name of Cold, if you follow my Instagram you may have heard a clip

37:16.420 --> 37:20.980
from one of them, it's a fun thing to do, and though I'm not expecting it of any great success,

37:21.060 --> 37:27.460
it would be pretty cool. Regarding other media, I have a load of film ideas, I recently started

37:27.460 --> 37:31.620
a document where I write them all down, one of the things I've always wanted to do is to

37:31.620 --> 37:36.180
screenwrite and direct a film. As mentioned earlier, I had considered agreeing it at one

37:36.180 --> 37:40.820
point, but thought it was too risky. I don't have too much formal training, but I do like to think

37:40.820 --> 37:45.540
that I would be in touch with human conflicts that could drive my plots and dialogue, though

37:45.540 --> 37:50.420
I'm not sure if that's enough for such a challenge. I would really like to consider it

37:50.420 --> 37:55.300
at one point, but for now I guess I'll just leave it on the back burner. I did make a parody movie

37:55.300 --> 37:57.860
with my friends, maybe you guys will see it one day.

37:57.860 --> 38:24.260
A truly classic clip, my ultimate goal is creative media, I cannot lie, but you also gotta be realistic

38:24.260 --> 38:28.260
sometimes, you can't just waltz in and declare yourself the next Laurence Olivier, you have to

38:28.260 --> 38:34.340
prove your worth in such a cutthroat industry, so I don't hold out hope, any success there will be

38:34.340 --> 38:39.140
a pleasant surprise. Relating to this channel, obviously I hope I can be more ambitious, maybe

38:39.140 --> 38:43.700
try and integrate a sense of self into some of my videos, there are also some burning issues that have

38:43.700 --> 38:49.220
been on my mind relating to YouTube that I want to talk about, however I feel like a facecam character

38:49.220 --> 38:54.180
break would be a good way to do them. Back when H3 did their YouTube callout videos, it's a shame

38:54.180 --> 38:58.900
they don't do them anymore, it's not like people have fewer bones to pick with YouTube, and even

38:58.900 --> 39:03.220
other transpiring situations that I don't feel comfortable with my current format would be good

39:03.220 --> 39:07.780
to talk about too, however I don't want to commit to too much, because it is quite a nerve-wracking

39:07.780 --> 39:12.900
thought for me. I also get a lot of political questions, whether I'm gonna go back into politics,

39:12.900 --> 39:17.380
and although I addressed this in my previous Q&A, I guess I'm prepared to talk about it briefly here.

39:17.380 --> 39:22.500
I have considered trying political content again, not on this channel, but maybe starting up another

39:22.500 --> 39:27.220
channel where I do more live footage, content talking about politics, maybe integrated with some

39:27.220 --> 39:32.580
creative ideas that would allow me to try out some of my cinematic tendencies. However, as a lot of

39:32.580 --> 39:37.540
people have noted, it's a really toxic environment, and I'm not sure I'm mentally ready to do something

39:37.540 --> 39:42.820
like that. Politically, there are no creators out there that fully represent how I feel. I'm not

39:42.820 --> 39:47.860
right-wing, I like a lot the leftist guys, and that's how I identify, but some of the communities

39:47.860 --> 39:54.580
seriously concern me with their strange drive for ideological purity, and I'll be honest, I'm not

39:54.580 --> 40:00.340
pure, I'm not perfect, and I'm not out here to let angry people affect my political views.

40:00.340 --> 40:05.540
I'm not gonna have what I believe in be based on tone policing, but if I ever did politics again,

40:05.540 --> 40:10.340
I doubt I would try and be part of a greater political community. I'm not here to tell others

40:10.340 --> 40:15.540
how to feel or how to handle their grievances with a broken system, but I've just never had

40:15.540 --> 40:21.620
the personal ability to be that vitriolic to people with differing opinions within reason,

40:21.620 --> 40:26.900
and I feel I'd be dead by 25 if I took that mentality. I might be anyway, but I at least gotta

40:26.900 --> 40:32.340
try and take care of myself. As for other channels, yeah, I have a few projects in the mixer, I'm setting

40:32.340 --> 40:37.140
up a Twitch channel, and that would be pretty swell. I might have a highlights channel, as said,

40:37.140 --> 40:41.220
when I see some of my friends having such a good time, I feel like I should try and get in on this

40:41.220 --> 40:46.340
as well, although obviously I'll be doing my own thing. I'm also setting up some side projects,

40:46.340 --> 40:52.020
lower pressure, less dramatic things, maybe even some very light entertainment. I don't expect it

40:52.020 --> 40:56.580
to affect my upload schedule, I can work quite efficiently where I need to, and to be honest,

40:56.580 --> 41:00.580
I think the chaos is dying down for the start of the year, and I'm prepared to take it on.

41:00.580 --> 41:05.540
If you hear my voice on another channel, don't be fazed that I'm doing something that you might not

41:05.540 --> 41:10.500
expect me to do. Then there's merch, I receive a few questions about that, I am doing merch soon,

41:10.500 --> 41:15.780
I've been beta testing some products, I'm gonna be releasing this really nice twat mug which reveals

41:15.780 --> 41:21.940
itself when heated, that's one thing that I actually actively like, which is a rarity. I also

41:21.940 --> 41:27.060
have this white text on black hoodie which reads too much free time for all you people out there

41:27.060 --> 41:31.940
who feel the vibe. The other thing that I'm trying to do a tad more are sponsorships, as I'm still

41:32.020 --> 41:36.180
rather cagey on YouTube's monetisation policy and the fact that they could change tomorrow.

41:36.180 --> 41:40.420
There's never a feeling of security in anything that you earn, but the whole drama with better

41:40.420 --> 41:44.820
help really switched me off, and since then I've only done two sponsorships. The latter was

41:44.820 --> 41:49.540
obviously the raid one, which was great fun, because they let me and the internet historian

41:49.540 --> 41:54.820
take the piss, but I wanna do some sponsorships where I can go in and say this brand is actually

41:54.820 --> 41:59.460
really good. However, on top of that, I actually want to use sponsor slots as a way to platform

41:59.460 --> 42:03.540
other creators, with the assurance of giving them a cut of the money made through that as well,

42:03.540 --> 42:07.380
it'll give them some space to show off their creative abilities and sell themselves,

42:07.380 --> 42:11.940
as well as the product, so although it's gonna take me a while to probably sort this out,

42:11.940 --> 42:16.580
that's another idea that's been playing on my mind. I also have a few other things I want to

42:16.580 --> 42:21.780
talk about too, and some other casual questions that I'll be happy to respond to, so let's go there right now.

42:23.780 --> 42:29.060
It's time to clean up some of the questions here and there, that I wasn't sure quite how to fit in.

42:29.060 --> 42:32.820
A fairly regular question has been about topics, obviously I explained how I pick them,

42:32.820 --> 42:37.380
and my process, but I do get questions about these sorts of topics. I want to keep this channel's main

42:37.380 --> 42:42.260
focus on YouTube topics, I will probably push the boat out here and there, I have a plan for

42:42.260 --> 42:47.380
collab where I talk about a TV show for example, but there'll be more treats of sorts, and they still

42:47.380 --> 42:52.260
talk about similar dynamics. I may make another channel where I occasionally post videos about

42:52.260 --> 42:56.900
less YouTube related topics, there has been one very highly requested topic that I don't really

42:56.900 --> 43:00.900
want to cover on this channel, but it has my attention given certain details which have piqued

43:00.900 --> 43:06.420
my interest. I do feel my channel works for a certain type of video, and I'm still coming to grips

43:06.420 --> 43:10.900
with which ones work best. A few times I've spoken about predators and their behaviour,

43:10.900 --> 43:16.580
and since then I've often received messages from people about others doing some very terrible

43:16.580 --> 43:21.540
things, often criminal, and asking me if I would expose them, and often that stuff makes me very

43:21.540 --> 43:26.100
nervous, and I typically suggest that it's referred to criminal authorities first. It's why I've become

43:26.100 --> 43:30.420
a lot more tentative when people are offered to send me evidence privately, I take preference to

43:30.420 --> 43:35.620
talking about what's out there already right now. Some people ask me about my branding and what I

43:35.620 --> 43:40.420
consider myself to be, and I don't like to make too many comments because although it's a cliche,

43:40.420 --> 43:44.500
I like to be myself and let people interpret what they think of me, whether that means they think

43:44.500 --> 43:50.340
I'm a commentator, an entertainer, a philosopher, an investigator, or a dickhead, so be it. I don't

43:50.340 --> 43:55.300
run any specific algorithm in my head for how I create my content, obviously I have methods,

43:55.300 --> 44:00.100
but I never really think about what I can do and what specific reaction it may provoke,

44:00.100 --> 44:04.740
but I guess that brings me to my next point about advice that I would give to people, and I never

44:04.740 --> 44:09.140
really say too much generally speaking, because the formula will always differ depending on the

44:09.140 --> 44:14.500
person, but I guess the best thing that I would say to a creator is to ask yourself, why would a

44:14.500 --> 44:19.220
viewer want to watch your content as opposed to other creators on the platform, and I think that's

44:19.220 --> 44:23.700
a good question because it was the one detail I often overlooked when making my earlier content,

44:23.700 --> 44:28.900
I never left an impact. When I ask that question, I don't mean it to discourage anyone or play on

44:28.900 --> 44:34.100
their insecurities, but more to stimulate them to think about how they can innovate their brand

44:34.100 --> 44:39.220
and carve out their own niche, and I think that's my other point, try not to be dissuaded by the

44:39.220 --> 44:44.420
fact that some people won't enjoy what you're doing, everyone has different tastes, try not

44:44.420 --> 44:49.940
to take it too personally, even if they try and make it personal. A lot of questions about dating

44:49.940 --> 44:55.060
and a few people asking me out, calling me cute, which I'm very flattered by, I think that's one

44:55.060 --> 44:59.860
of the things about YouTube life, it has definitely made it harder for dating. I've had two formal

44:59.860 --> 45:04.340
dates in the last year, they were both nice, but in the end it just became impractical when I'm

45:04.340 --> 45:09.780
still so restless. There are a lot of online ships, and I'd be lying if I didn't say I catch feelings,

45:09.780 --> 45:15.460
but it's complicated. I'm a person with very high walls, and I'm unsure how involved with YouTube

45:15.460 --> 45:21.220
I'd want my spouse to be. It's lonely, and I'm lonely, but you can't force these things.

45:21.220 --> 45:25.220
I also have a lot of identity questions that I've never really got the chance to think about because

45:25.220 --> 45:30.500
my life has been so hectic, and I want to resolve some of them before I can commit to someone else,

45:30.500 --> 45:35.860
who may fall in love with someone I don't feel I really am. A lot of people ask me what my type is,

45:35.860 --> 45:40.820
and I don't like to say too much, but I like people who I describe as energetic introverts,

45:40.820 --> 45:45.700
there's an element of reservation but a shade of optimism too. I think I need that balance in my

45:45.700 --> 45:51.620
life, I think I need someone stable to provide some security and ease my paranoia. My celebrity

45:51.620 --> 45:57.620
crush would be Tom Holland I suppose, so if you want a general idea of what I'm into appearance-wise,

45:57.620 --> 46:03.300
well there it is, but there's flexibility on those fronts. Some people ask what I do to try and relax,

46:03.300 --> 46:08.820
emphasis on the try there. I like sports, I play some squash to mainly maintain fitness,

46:08.820 --> 46:13.380
I'd like to do more football, or soccer, as you may call it, in fact, I think I'm pretty good in a

46:13.380 --> 46:17.700
wing-bat position. However, I suffer from these nerve problems in my arms which make it more

46:17.700 --> 46:22.580
difficult to participate in such activities, really bad pins and needles, and no one knows

46:22.580 --> 46:26.820
exactly what to do about them, although I've had a couple appointments here and there and attempts

46:26.820 --> 46:32.260
to alleviate it. I obviously enjoy music, and I spoke about that, I also enjoy cinema, you guys

46:32.260 --> 46:36.580
probably know my favourite movie as Hot Fuzz, but if you're more interested in following my film

46:36.580 --> 46:42.420
taste you can check out my Letterboxd. I like TV shows, I'm currently watching Fargo and Better

46:42.420 --> 46:48.260
Call Saul with my family, both pretty epic, I like them. I also enjoy quizzing, for people who know me

46:48.260 --> 46:53.540
I have a bit of an obsession with the acquisition of information, and that can be seen in pub quizzes.

46:53.540 --> 46:58.260
I would really like to go on a game show, so if there are any game show executives watching this

46:58.260 --> 47:04.740
video, hey, hit me up, I have applied a fair few times. The final goal is to win Who Wants To Be

47:04.740 --> 47:09.300
A Millionaire. I don't know if I'll ever have the opportunity, but a boy can dream, eh?

47:09.300 --> 47:14.020
As for YouTube, the creators that I watch, I watch Todd and the Shadows, Billboard Breakdown

47:14.020 --> 47:19.620
by Spectrum, Pulse, I Hate Everything, Internet Historian, Pyrocynical, Mr. Gigi, obviously The

47:19.620 --> 47:26.020
Boys, Primink, J. Aubrey, Average Pixel, all those beautiful lads, I could go on. If there's a topic

47:26.020 --> 47:30.180
that captures my interest, then I'll probably watch the video, providing I don't actually dislike the

47:30.180 --> 47:34.420
creator's content. An interesting question is about who I really want to collaborate with, and that's

47:34.420 --> 47:39.060
a difficult one, because I can collaborate with a lot of people who I haven't yet that are pretty

47:39.060 --> 47:43.940
obvious, and I could just say, you know, Primink, and obviously you guys would know that completely,

47:43.940 --> 47:49.140
so I guess I can throw a curveball in there, one person who I think would be cool is Pyrocynical.

47:49.140 --> 47:52.660
He's always been really pleasant, treats me like an individual, remembers details that

47:52.660 --> 47:57.300
I don't remember telling him, so that would be good. I haven't really had much contact though, as

47:57.300 --> 48:02.100
he's wise enough to stay off social media. A lot of people have asked me about alternative career

48:02.100 --> 48:06.260
paths, if YouTube packed up tomorrow, what I'd do, and I think that's a hard question. I'd really

48:06.260 --> 48:10.900
like to politics again, I'm very interested in local politics, I recently rejoined my local

48:10.900 --> 48:15.380
liberal Democrat party because I feel like there are still a lot of local issues that matter to me.

48:15.380 --> 48:20.180
I walk down the street, and the town is just so depressing, and I feel like there's so much more

48:20.180 --> 48:26.260
that can be done, but I also still don't know if I belong with them. Creative arts, of course,

48:26.260 --> 48:30.260
who knows what would happen there. I always worry that my status as a YouTube commentator would

48:30.260 --> 48:35.300
prevent me from being accepted in other places, but I think maybe that's a bit more of my paranoia,

48:35.300 --> 48:39.540
it's tiring stuff being this eccentric. I'm not sure if there are too many other questions that I

48:39.540 --> 48:45.060
want to respond to now, obviously gotta save some for my next Q&A. I'll score some quick fire points,

48:45.060 --> 48:50.100
my favourite colour is red, my favourite animals are probably dogs, I'd love to dye my hair silvery

48:50.100 --> 48:56.100
white sometimes, thank you Franny, I'd marry them all and maybe kill them afterwards. I actually

48:56.100 --> 49:00.020
love Mario Kart and I will beat you at it, you were never allowed out of the basement, probably

49:00.580 --> 49:06.420
Asda, bees are good, I am hydrated, and no I have not heard about Raid Shadow Legends, please tell me more.

49:06.980 --> 49:13.140
Really? No. Oh, and my favourite video? Well, I guess it could be this one, it's refreshing and

49:13.140 --> 49:17.140
different, I know I can't do them every day, but it allowed me to talk about things that are close

49:17.140 --> 49:21.940
to me, and things that have been playing on my mind, hopefully you learned a bit too, but if you

49:21.940 --> 49:26.820
discount this one, probably Austin Jones, in spite of the annoying glitch. Thank you guys for watching,

49:26.820 --> 49:29.460
I'm The Right Opinion, and I'll see you in the next one.
