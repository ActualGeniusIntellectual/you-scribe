1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,120
I like music, but not this much.

2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,640
Hello ladies and gentlemen and welcome to The Right Opinion,

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,800
the home of a twat with too much free time.

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,120
And Drake, when will you stop?

5
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:19,040
Drake has developed this identity so prolific that people just accept

6
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:21,920
that you can't stop him and just play his music anyway.

7
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,160
And it's not like this has happened overnight with stars like Britney Spears and the Pussycat Dolls.

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,320
He's been making popular music for a while now.

9
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,520
He's had hits here and there.

10
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:34,480
It all started around eight years ago with this song Best I Ever Had, which I unironically enjoy.

11
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,280
At his best, Drake can pull off some very sincere emotions.

12
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,400
In Best I Ever Had, it sounds like she is actually the best,

13
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,400
and it sounds like he is indoctrinated by her.

14
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,000
And this seemed to be the case for a few years.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,640
Bar started from the bottom, which is a joke to this day.

16
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,640
He started from the bottom, now he's here.

17
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,040
I did not need a whole fucking song about that.

18
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,600
Songs like Take Care, Find Your Love, and Hold On We're Going Home

19
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,040
had a tendency to translate genuine emotions that made me involved in the song.

20
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:01,280
And now I'm going to go into an unpopular opinion, probably, but an opinion nonetheless.

21
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,480
I liked Hotline Bling.

22
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,760
Admittedly, it was a grower.

23
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,440
But there was something that I enjoyed about it.

24
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:09,680
And a lot of the criticism stemmed from the fact that the song made Drake look like a possessive prick.

25
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,400
And yeah, it does.

26
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,600
But in response to that, music isn't always about positive role models.

27
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,920
If they're sincere in that song, I think it can work.

28
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,360
And Drake was very sincere.

29
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,080
He was sincere about being a prick, but still sincere.

30
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,080
But since then, it has gone too far.

31
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,360
Drake has to be stopped.

32
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,480
It feels like he's progressively going into a coma in every song.

33
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,920
He sounds more and more dead.

34
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,640
Soon he'll just be releasing songs of him on the fucking toilet,

35
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,160
and they'll still probably go to number one.

36
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:36,560
Drake's One Dance almost beat the record for the longest time spent at number one in the UK.

37
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,960
It was so fucking boring.

38
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,080
So fucking boring.

39
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:44,560
And it sounded like it was produced by a fucking preschooler with the clunky piano

40
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,200
and the beat just so uninteresting.

41
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,280
It sounded like an amateur song.

42
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,280
He's so lazy as well.

43
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,680
He hasn't released a proper video since Hotline Bling.

44
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,000
And in my thoughts, he hasn't released a proper song either,

45
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:01,280
apart from, like, maybe Too Good, which probably does class as one, but just.

46
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,560
And now he's released Fake Love, which rips off the beat from Hotline Bling

47
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,800
and only embellishes on his lazy mentality.

48
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,840
Let's have a listen now.

49
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,760
I feel like Drake has created this lazy persona, and it's his gimmick now.

50
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,440
But how much lazier can you become before you stop making real music?

51
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,960
Maybe you'll become too lazy to make music and just release blank discs.

52
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,520
But then again, as he said on Best I Ever Had,

53
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,400
Burn so big, I could probably sell a blank disc.

54
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,240
Also, he's been collaborating with Future, who has already proven that despite the fact

55
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:35,280
that he's been around forever with his autotuned inebriation,

56
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,520
people rip off his style and seem to do better.

57
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,680
Panda, panda, panda, panda, panda.

58
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,960
I'm never saying that again.

59
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:44,480
When an artist releases this much and this regularly, they're going to surely burn out

60
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,600
and Fake Love just seems to signal the beginning of that burning

61
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,760
because he just sounds absolutely morbid.

62
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,240
Once again, we haven't seen him since Hotline Bling.

63
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,680
Maybe he actually died and the label just want to milk him for what it's worth,

64
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,280
like some Michael Jackson shit.

65
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,400
If you want my prediction, which you probably don't,

66
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,880
Fake Love will be the final hit for a while in Drake's discography,

67
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,840
apart from features of course, like fucking Rihanna's work

68
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,160
where he gawks at her shaking her ass the whole time.

69
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,560
I think he will return in the future, but for now,

70
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,000
I think this may well be the end of Drake.

71
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,280
If you want my opinion on music in 2016, it has been an absolutely awful year.

72
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,160
Absolutely terrible.

73
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,880
The worst music isn't necessarily worse,

74
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:28,240
but there's been really small amounts of good music

75
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:31,840
and that's a real shame because 2016 hasn't been the best year around.

76
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,200
Trash.

77
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,080
Right opinion.

78
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,960
2016 was trash.

79
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,560
2017 is going to be James' year.

80
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,040
It is true.

81
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,320
I agree with that one.

82
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,460
Oh!

83
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,160
Are you going to-
