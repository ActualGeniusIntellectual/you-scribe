00:00.000 --> 00:03.120
I like music, but not this much.

00:08.480 --> 00:10.640
Hello ladies and gentlemen and welcome to The Right Opinion,

00:10.640 --> 00:12.800
the home of a twat with too much free time.

00:12.800 --> 00:15.120
And Drake, when will you stop?

00:15.840 --> 00:19.040
Drake has developed this identity so prolific that people just accept

00:19.040 --> 00:21.920
that you can't stop him and just play his music anyway.

00:21.920 --> 00:26.160
And it's not like this has happened overnight with stars like Britney Spears and the Pussycat Dolls.

00:26.160 --> 00:28.320
He's been making popular music for a while now.

00:28.320 --> 00:29.520
He's had hits here and there.

00:29.520 --> 00:34.480
It all started around eight years ago with this song Best I Ever Had, which I unironically enjoy.

00:34.480 --> 00:37.280
At his best, Drake can pull off some very sincere emotions.

00:37.280 --> 00:40.400
In Best I Ever Had, it sounds like she is actually the best,

00:40.400 --> 00:42.400
and it sounds like he is indoctrinated by her.

00:42.400 --> 00:44.000
And this seemed to be the case for a few years.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.640
Bar started from the bottom, which is a joke to this day.

00:46.640 --> 00:48.640
He started from the bottom, now he's here.

00:48.640 --> 00:51.040
I did not need a whole fucking song about that.

00:51.040 --> 00:53.600
Songs like Take Care, Find Your Love, and Hold On We're Going Home

00:53.600 --> 00:57.040
had a tendency to translate genuine emotions that made me involved in the song.

00:57.040 --> 01:01.280
And now I'm going to go into an unpopular opinion, probably, but an opinion nonetheless.

01:01.280 --> 01:02.480
I liked Hotline Bling.

01:02.480 --> 01:03.760
Admittedly, it was a grower.

01:03.760 --> 01:05.440
But there was something that I enjoyed about it.

01:05.440 --> 01:09.680
And a lot of the criticism stemmed from the fact that the song made Drake look like a possessive prick.

01:09.680 --> 01:10.400
And yeah, it does.

01:10.400 --> 01:13.600
But in response to that, music isn't always about positive role models.

01:13.600 --> 01:15.920
If they're sincere in that song, I think it can work.

01:15.920 --> 01:17.360
And Drake was very sincere.

01:17.360 --> 01:20.080
He was sincere about being a prick, but still sincere.

01:20.080 --> 01:22.080
But since then, it has gone too far.

01:22.080 --> 01:23.360
Drake has to be stopped.

01:23.360 --> 01:26.480
It feels like he's progressively going into a coma in every song.

01:26.480 --> 01:27.920
He sounds more and more dead.

01:27.920 --> 01:30.640
Soon he'll just be releasing songs of him on the fucking toilet,

01:30.640 --> 01:32.160
and they'll still probably go to number one.

01:32.160 --> 01:36.560
Drake's One Dance almost beat the record for the longest time spent at number one in the UK.

01:36.560 --> 01:38.960
It was so fucking boring.

01:38.960 --> 01:40.080
So fucking boring.

01:40.080 --> 01:44.560
And it sounded like it was produced by a fucking preschooler with the clunky piano

01:44.560 --> 01:47.200
and the beat just so uninteresting.

01:47.200 --> 01:49.280
It sounded like an amateur song.

01:50.000 --> 01:51.280
He's so lazy as well.

01:51.280 --> 01:53.680
He hasn't released a proper video since Hotline Bling.

01:53.680 --> 01:56.000
And in my thoughts, he hasn't released a proper song either,

01:56.080 --> 02:01.280
apart from, like, maybe Too Good, which probably does class as one, but just.

02:01.280 --> 02:04.560
And now he's released Fake Love, which rips off the beat from Hotline Bling

02:04.560 --> 02:06.800
and only embellishes on his lazy mentality.

02:06.800 --> 02:07.840
Let's have a listen now.

02:12.640 --> 02:15.760
I feel like Drake has created this lazy persona, and it's his gimmick now.

02:15.760 --> 02:19.440
But how much lazier can you become before you stop making real music?

02:19.440 --> 02:22.960
Maybe you'll become too lazy to make music and just release blank discs.

02:22.960 --> 02:25.520
But then again, as he said on Best I Ever Had,

02:25.600 --> 02:28.400
Burn so big, I could probably sell a blank disc.

02:28.400 --> 02:32.240
Also, he's been collaborating with Future, who has already proven that despite the fact

02:32.240 --> 02:35.280
that he's been around forever with his autotuned inebriation,

02:35.280 --> 02:37.520
people rip off his style and seem to do better.

02:37.520 --> 02:39.680
Panda, panda, panda, panda, panda.

02:39.680 --> 02:40.960
I'm never saying that again.

02:40.960 --> 02:44.480
When an artist releases this much and this regularly, they're going to surely burn out

02:44.480 --> 02:47.600
and Fake Love just seems to signal the beginning of that burning

02:47.600 --> 02:51.760
because he just sounds absolutely morbid.

02:51.760 --> 02:54.240
Once again, we haven't seen him since Hotline Bling.

02:54.240 --> 02:57.680
Maybe he actually died and the label just want to milk him for what it's worth,

02:57.680 --> 02:59.280
like some Michael Jackson shit.

03:00.080 --> 03:02.400
If you want my prediction, which you probably don't,

03:02.400 --> 03:04.880
Fake Love will be the final hit for a while in Drake's discography,

03:04.880 --> 03:07.840
apart from features of course, like fucking Rihanna's work

03:07.840 --> 03:10.160
where he gawks at her shaking her ass the whole time.

03:10.160 --> 03:12.560
I think he will return in the future, but for now,

03:13.360 --> 03:16.000
I think this may well be the end of Drake.

03:16.720 --> 03:21.280
If you want my opinion on music in 2016, it has been an absolutely awful year.

03:21.280 --> 03:22.160
Absolutely terrible.

03:22.480 --> 03:24.880
The worst music isn't necessarily worse,

03:24.880 --> 03:28.240
but there's been really small amounts of good music

03:28.240 --> 03:31.840
and that's a real shame because 2016 hasn't been the best year around.

03:32.560 --> 03:33.200
Trash.

03:35.040 --> 03:36.080
Right opinion.

03:37.200 --> 03:38.960
2016 was trash.

03:39.840 --> 03:42.560
2017 is going to be James' year.

03:43.360 --> 03:45.040
It is true.

03:45.040 --> 03:46.320
I agree with that one.

03:46.960 --> 03:47.460
Oh!

03:49.600 --> 03:50.160
Are you going to-
