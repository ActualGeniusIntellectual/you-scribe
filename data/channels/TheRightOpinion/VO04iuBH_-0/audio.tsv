0	3120	I like music, but not this much.
8480	10640	Hello ladies and gentlemen and welcome to The Right Opinion,
10640	12800	the home of a twat with too much free time.
12800	15120	And Drake, when will you stop?
15840	19040	Drake has developed this identity so prolific that people just accept
19040	21920	that you can't stop him and just play his music anyway.
21920	26160	And it's not like this has happened overnight with stars like Britney Spears and the Pussycat Dolls.
26160	28320	He's been making popular music for a while now.
28320	29520	He's had hits here and there.
29520	34480	It all started around eight years ago with this song Best I Ever Had, which I unironically enjoy.
34480	37280	At his best, Drake can pull off some very sincere emotions.
37280	40400	In Best I Ever Had, it sounds like she is actually the best,
40400	42400	and it sounds like he is indoctrinated by her.
42400	44000	And this seemed to be the case for a few years.
44000	46640	Bar started from the bottom, which is a joke to this day.
46640	48640	He started from the bottom, now he's here.
48640	51040	I did not need a whole fucking song about that.
51040	53600	Songs like Take Care, Find Your Love, and Hold On We're Going Home
53600	57040	had a tendency to translate genuine emotions that made me involved in the song.
57040	61280	And now I'm going to go into an unpopular opinion, probably, but an opinion nonetheless.
61280	62480	I liked Hotline Bling.
62480	63760	Admittedly, it was a grower.
63760	65440	But there was something that I enjoyed about it.
65440	69680	And a lot of the criticism stemmed from the fact that the song made Drake look like a possessive prick.
69680	70400	And yeah, it does.
70400	73600	But in response to that, music isn't always about positive role models.
73600	75920	If they're sincere in that song, I think it can work.
75920	77360	And Drake was very sincere.
77360	80080	He was sincere about being a prick, but still sincere.
80080	82080	But since then, it has gone too far.
82080	83360	Drake has to be stopped.
83360	86480	It feels like he's progressively going into a coma in every song.
86480	87920	He sounds more and more dead.
87920	90640	Soon he'll just be releasing songs of him on the fucking toilet,
90640	92160	and they'll still probably go to number one.
92160	96560	Drake's One Dance almost beat the record for the longest time spent at number one in the UK.
96560	98960	It was so fucking boring.
98960	100080	So fucking boring.
100080	104560	And it sounded like it was produced by a fucking preschooler with the clunky piano
104560	107200	and the beat just so uninteresting.
107200	109280	It sounded like an amateur song.
110000	111280	He's so lazy as well.
111280	113680	He hasn't released a proper video since Hotline Bling.
113680	116000	And in my thoughts, he hasn't released a proper song either,
116080	121280	apart from, like, maybe Too Good, which probably does class as one, but just.
121280	124560	And now he's released Fake Love, which rips off the beat from Hotline Bling
124560	126800	and only embellishes on his lazy mentality.
126800	127840	Let's have a listen now.
132640	135760	I feel like Drake has created this lazy persona, and it's his gimmick now.
135760	139440	But how much lazier can you become before you stop making real music?
139440	142960	Maybe you'll become too lazy to make music and just release blank discs.
142960	145520	But then again, as he said on Best I Ever Had,
145600	148400	Burn so big, I could probably sell a blank disc.
148400	152240	Also, he's been collaborating with Future, who has already proven that despite the fact
152240	155280	that he's been around forever with his autotuned inebriation,
155280	157520	people rip off his style and seem to do better.
157520	159680	Panda, panda, panda, panda, panda.
159680	160960	I'm never saying that again.
160960	164480	When an artist releases this much and this regularly, they're going to surely burn out
164480	167600	and Fake Love just seems to signal the beginning of that burning
167600	171760	because he just sounds absolutely morbid.
171760	174240	Once again, we haven't seen him since Hotline Bling.
174240	177680	Maybe he actually died and the label just want to milk him for what it's worth,
177680	179280	like some Michael Jackson shit.
180080	182400	If you want my prediction, which you probably don't,
182400	184880	Fake Love will be the final hit for a while in Drake's discography,
184880	187840	apart from features of course, like fucking Rihanna's work
187840	190160	where he gawks at her shaking her ass the whole time.
190160	192560	I think he will return in the future, but for now,
193360	196000	I think this may well be the end of Drake.
196720	201280	If you want my opinion on music in 2016, it has been an absolutely awful year.
201280	202160	Absolutely terrible.
202480	204880	The worst music isn't necessarily worse,
204880	208240	but there's been really small amounts of good music
208240	211840	and that's a real shame because 2016 hasn't been the best year around.
212560	213200	Trash.
215040	216080	Right opinion.
217200	218960	2016 was trash.
219840	222560	2017 is going to be James' year.
223360	225040	It is true.
225040	226320	I agree with that one.
226960	227460	Oh!
229600	230160	Are you going to-
