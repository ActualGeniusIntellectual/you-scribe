00:00.000 --> 00:01.920
We're going to talk about something more serious now.

00:07.680 --> 00:11.680
Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time,

00:11.680 --> 00:13.880
and let's talk about the jolly old depression.

00:13.880 --> 00:17.080
It's been a while since I've spoken about mental health, but we're returning to it today,

00:17.080 --> 00:20.920
mainly because of a few comments that I've seen, and the debate it subsequently inspires.

00:20.920 --> 00:24.920
This man is Andrew Tate. He is a cruiserweight and heavyweight kickboxer from Chicago.

00:24.920 --> 00:29.960
He has attracted controversy with his recent statements on depression, that were certainly divisive to say the least.

00:29.960 --> 00:31.320
Let's get the tweet up itself.

00:37.520 --> 00:42.680
Now this provoked thousands of responses, 21,000 to be precise, which doesn't necessarily surprise me.

00:42.680 --> 00:46.640
He goes on to argue his point about how depression stems from a dissatisfaction from life,

00:46.640 --> 00:51.880
and the lethargy from these people towards changing it, and how it is that person's responsibility to change it as well.

00:51.880 --> 00:54.720
He also went on Paul Joseph Watson's channel and argued his case.

00:54.720 --> 00:59.080
Now Paul Joseph Watson urged people to watch the whole video before passing judgement, so I did.

00:59.080 --> 01:04.040
Now the first thing I think it is important to say is that you don't have to be an expert to necessarily comment on these affairs.

01:04.040 --> 01:07.560
There's plenty of leeway in the debate for people of many persuasions to weigh in,

01:07.560 --> 01:09.840
so I understand where they're coming from on that one.

01:09.840 --> 01:12.560
But let's cut to the chase. I watched the video, and I'll give them kudos,

01:12.560 --> 01:17.040
because they put their arguments forward clearly, and I can understand it, so now I can actually retort.

01:17.040 --> 01:21.240
The first point I picked up on was the overreliance on situational circumstances by Mr. Tate.

01:21.240 --> 01:24.120
He heavily relies on the assumption that depression is situational,

01:24.120 --> 01:27.680
and although I do believe that the situation can be considered as a factor,

01:27.680 --> 01:32.600
it's a genuinely accepted actuality that there are many strains of depression that rely on interior mechanisms,

01:32.600 --> 01:36.280
such as chemical imbalances that cause negative feelings to become inescapable.

01:36.280 --> 01:40.880
If depression was solely based on the surroundings, you wouldn't see rich, successful people committing suicide.

01:40.880 --> 01:45.440
But we do. Very successful people indeed, whom are unfortunately rather tortured on the inside.

01:45.440 --> 01:49.960
Speaking from a personal perspective, I've become particularly depressed when I feel like I'm lacking progress in my life.

01:49.960 --> 01:52.680
It happens a lot, and it's not something I'm necessarily happy with,

01:52.720 --> 01:55.400
but it's not something you can simply click your fingers and change.

01:55.400 --> 01:59.200
I'm working my ass off in everything I do currently, and as much as Tate might like to envision it,

01:59.200 --> 02:02.760
just because you're talented and you do something good doesn't mean it's gonna work out.

02:02.760 --> 02:06.000
It's the hard truth of life. Some people are incredibly skilled individuals,

02:06.000 --> 02:08.760
but the truth of social mobility is a tough one to traverse.

02:08.760 --> 02:13.240
Tate suggests that people can get healthy, start their own businesses, but that's a lot easier said than done,

02:13.240 --> 02:17.000
and we have to acknowledge that a lot of people's attitudes are influenced by their upbringing,

02:17.000 --> 02:20.200
and prospective students aren't really treated like possible entrepreneurs.

02:20.200 --> 02:23.800
And I think it's shit, but there's a level of accountability that has to be down to the system,

02:23.800 --> 02:27.640
and telling a depressed person to work harder is a huge oversimplification.

02:27.640 --> 02:31.720
They also reference the rising rates of depression in the US. Now that's an important footnote,

02:31.720 --> 02:35.280
but the false assumption they make there is that because depression diagnosis is on the rise,

02:35.280 --> 02:38.760
depression must be on the rise. What they fail to consider are other variables,

02:38.760 --> 02:42.680
such as the fact that people may just be more aware of depression and the treatments they can get,

02:42.680 --> 02:45.960
and people may subsequently be more eager to seek medical help for it.

02:45.960 --> 02:49.600
It cannot be denied that there is a massive drive in mental health awareness,

02:49.600 --> 02:53.200
and given the increased awareness, diagnoses would be expected to go up.

02:53.200 --> 02:59.640
Though 400% is a large number, it's not impossible for that number to be explained through extraneous variables alone, from my point of view.

02:59.640 --> 03:03.640
Studies have found that after a positive event, someone's mood may improve temporarily,

03:03.640 --> 03:05.840
but it often returns to the base rate afterwards.

03:05.840 --> 03:08.400
What prevents me from being depressed is change in autonomy,

03:08.400 --> 03:12.200
but very few people have the ability to be in that constant state of adaptation.

03:12.200 --> 03:14.640
It'd be fucking cool, but it's just not possible.

03:14.640 --> 03:18.960
Depression isn't a frame of mind for many people, it's something that isn't easily changeable,

03:18.960 --> 03:20.840
and it's always existed in society.

03:20.840 --> 03:22.960
Now, I'm not suggesting that that's the case with everyone,

03:22.960 --> 03:27.080
and depression in the mood, and depression in the actual condition are very diverse predicaments,

03:27.080 --> 03:30.320
but only one is really possible to address in any circumstance.

03:30.320 --> 03:34.560
And even then, saying work harder is a hefty statement when many of them are working hard.

03:34.560 --> 03:36.960
It's like telling a poor person to just get rich.

03:36.960 --> 03:39.600
Depressed people and lazy people are by no means synonymous.

03:39.600 --> 03:44.440
And even with that said, I think you'll be hard-pressed to find a relationship between income and depression rate,

03:44.440 --> 03:47.600
and I know success isn't necessarily indicative of income, but there is a link.

03:47.640 --> 03:49.080
It is something that you can measure.

03:49.080 --> 03:53.320
My personal opinion is that depression and suicide are often contributed to by isolation,

03:53.320 --> 03:55.120
and if you look at the suicide rates in America,

03:55.120 --> 03:59.560
they are very worryingly, closely, negatively correlated to population density of each state.

03:59.560 --> 04:02.320
However, people who are depressed may not necessarily report it,

04:02.320 --> 04:07.000
so this skews the results to the point where suicide and depression themselves are very weakly correlated.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.240
Now, correlation can not imply causation, but it's certainly food for thought.

04:10.240 --> 04:12.320
You also have to note the importance of the word contribute.

04:12.320 --> 04:15.880
You can live a happy family life and still be insanely depressed.

04:15.880 --> 04:18.160
Unfortunately, some people can't change that.

04:18.160 --> 04:22.040
I don't doubt that there is this existence of situational depression, but it's nothing new,

04:22.040 --> 04:27.640
and I do think the doctors probably prescribe medication too liberally for depression rather than considering other treatments.

04:27.640 --> 04:33.040
But starting off your thread with depression isn't real is going to be hammered by people because it's a universal statement,

04:33.040 --> 04:37.640
and there cannot be denying that some people suffer depression no matter what situation they find themselves in,

04:37.640 --> 04:39.440
and find it very hard to combat it.

04:39.440 --> 04:42.480
And that's why, as I said earlier, even rich people commit suicide.

04:42.480 --> 04:47.040
There was also this statement that suicides are increasing, and I understand that in the US they are.

04:47.040 --> 04:52.880
However, in many countries, UK included, suicide rate has gone down despite prescription of antidepressants going up.

04:52.880 --> 04:58.480
Depression is a hard topic. What we do know is that it's something that there is many causes and many strains that contribute to it,

04:58.480 --> 05:00.400
some more chemical, some more situational.

05:00.400 --> 05:02.760
And if you attempt to make it a black and white conversation,

05:02.760 --> 05:08.600
you end up making a grossly reductionist comment that undermines what we have found out about depression in the last few decades.

05:08.600 --> 05:12.320
I know it's not an easy topic to discuss, but it's not something that I rate Mr. Taiton.

05:12.360 --> 05:14.960
Anyway, long video, that's all I have to say about depression.

05:14.960 --> 05:18.040
I think it's an interesting topic, but one that has to be approached with caution.

05:18.040 --> 05:23.360
All thoughts in the comments below are appreciated, but until then, I'm the right opinion, and I'll see you in the next one.
