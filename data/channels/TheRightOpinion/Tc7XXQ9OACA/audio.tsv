0	1920	We're going to talk about something more serious now.
7680	11680	Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time,
11680	13880	and let's talk about the jolly old depression.
13880	17080	It's been a while since I've spoken about mental health, but we're returning to it today,
17080	20920	mainly because of a few comments that I've seen, and the debate it subsequently inspires.
20920	24920	This man is Andrew Tate. He is a cruiserweight and heavyweight kickboxer from Chicago.
24920	29960	He has attracted controversy with his recent statements on depression, that were certainly divisive to say the least.
29960	31320	Let's get the tweet up itself.
37520	42680	Now this provoked thousands of responses, 21,000 to be precise, which doesn't necessarily surprise me.
42680	46640	He goes on to argue his point about how depression stems from a dissatisfaction from life,
46640	51880	and the lethargy from these people towards changing it, and how it is that person's responsibility to change it as well.
51880	54720	He also went on Paul Joseph Watson's channel and argued his case.
54720	59080	Now Paul Joseph Watson urged people to watch the whole video before passing judgement, so I did.
59080	64040	Now the first thing I think it is important to say is that you don't have to be an expert to necessarily comment on these affairs.
64040	67560	There's plenty of leeway in the debate for people of many persuasions to weigh in,
67560	69840	so I understand where they're coming from on that one.
69840	72560	But let's cut to the chase. I watched the video, and I'll give them kudos,
72560	77040	because they put their arguments forward clearly, and I can understand it, so now I can actually retort.
77040	81240	The first point I picked up on was the overreliance on situational circumstances by Mr. Tate.
81240	84120	He heavily relies on the assumption that depression is situational,
84120	87680	and although I do believe that the situation can be considered as a factor,
87680	92600	it's a genuinely accepted actuality that there are many strains of depression that rely on interior mechanisms,
92600	96280	such as chemical imbalances that cause negative feelings to become inescapable.
96280	100880	If depression was solely based on the surroundings, you wouldn't see rich, successful people committing suicide.
100880	105440	But we do. Very successful people indeed, whom are unfortunately rather tortured on the inside.
105440	109960	Speaking from a personal perspective, I've become particularly depressed when I feel like I'm lacking progress in my life.
109960	112680	It happens a lot, and it's not something I'm necessarily happy with,
112720	115400	but it's not something you can simply click your fingers and change.
115400	119200	I'm working my ass off in everything I do currently, and as much as Tate might like to envision it,
119200	122760	just because you're talented and you do something good doesn't mean it's gonna work out.
122760	126000	It's the hard truth of life. Some people are incredibly skilled individuals,
126000	128760	but the truth of social mobility is a tough one to traverse.
128760	133240	Tate suggests that people can get healthy, start their own businesses, but that's a lot easier said than done,
133240	137000	and we have to acknowledge that a lot of people's attitudes are influenced by their upbringing,
137000	140200	and prospective students aren't really treated like possible entrepreneurs.
140200	143800	And I think it's shit, but there's a level of accountability that has to be down to the system,
143800	147640	and telling a depressed person to work harder is a huge oversimplification.
147640	151720	They also reference the rising rates of depression in the US. Now that's an important footnote,
151720	155280	but the false assumption they make there is that because depression diagnosis is on the rise,
155280	158760	depression must be on the rise. What they fail to consider are other variables,
158760	162680	such as the fact that people may just be more aware of depression and the treatments they can get,
162680	165960	and people may subsequently be more eager to seek medical help for it.
165960	169600	It cannot be denied that there is a massive drive in mental health awareness,
169600	173200	and given the increased awareness, diagnoses would be expected to go up.
173200	179640	Though 400% is a large number, it's not impossible for that number to be explained through extraneous variables alone, from my point of view.
179640	183640	Studies have found that after a positive event, someone's mood may improve temporarily,
183640	185840	but it often returns to the base rate afterwards.
185840	188400	What prevents me from being depressed is change in autonomy,
188400	192200	but very few people have the ability to be in that constant state of adaptation.
192200	194640	It'd be fucking cool, but it's just not possible.
194640	198960	Depression isn't a frame of mind for many people, it's something that isn't easily changeable,
198960	200840	and it's always existed in society.
200840	202960	Now, I'm not suggesting that that's the case with everyone,
202960	207080	and depression in the mood, and depression in the actual condition are very diverse predicaments,
207080	210320	but only one is really possible to address in any circumstance.
210320	214560	And even then, saying work harder is a hefty statement when many of them are working hard.
214560	216960	It's like telling a poor person to just get rich.
216960	219600	Depressed people and lazy people are by no means synonymous.
219600	224440	And even with that said, I think you'll be hard-pressed to find a relationship between income and depression rate,
224440	227600	and I know success isn't necessarily indicative of income, but there is a link.
227640	229080	It is something that you can measure.
229080	233320	My personal opinion is that depression and suicide are often contributed to by isolation,
233320	235120	and if you look at the suicide rates in America,
235120	239560	they are very worryingly, closely, negatively correlated to population density of each state.
239560	242320	However, people who are depressed may not necessarily report it,
242320	247000	so this skews the results to the point where suicide and depression themselves are very weakly correlated.
247000	250240	Now, correlation can not imply causation, but it's certainly food for thought.
250240	252320	You also have to note the importance of the word contribute.
252320	255880	You can live a happy family life and still be insanely depressed.
255880	258160	Unfortunately, some people can't change that.
258160	262040	I don't doubt that there is this existence of situational depression, but it's nothing new,
262040	267640	and I do think the doctors probably prescribe medication too liberally for depression rather than considering other treatments.
267640	273040	But starting off your thread with depression isn't real is going to be hammered by people because it's a universal statement,
273040	277640	and there cannot be denying that some people suffer depression no matter what situation they find themselves in,
277640	279440	and find it very hard to combat it.
279440	282480	And that's why, as I said earlier, even rich people commit suicide.
282480	287040	There was also this statement that suicides are increasing, and I understand that in the US they are.
287040	292880	However, in many countries, UK included, suicide rate has gone down despite prescription of antidepressants going up.
292880	298480	Depression is a hard topic. What we do know is that it's something that there is many causes and many strains that contribute to it,
298480	300400	some more chemical, some more situational.
300400	302760	And if you attempt to make it a black and white conversation,
302760	308600	you end up making a grossly reductionist comment that undermines what we have found out about depression in the last few decades.
308600	312320	I know it's not an easy topic to discuss, but it's not something that I rate Mr. Taiton.
312360	314960	Anyway, long video, that's all I have to say about depression.
314960	318040	I think it's an interesting topic, but one that has to be approached with caution.
318040	323360	All thoughts in the comments below are appreciated, but until then, I'm the right opinion, and I'll see you in the next one.
