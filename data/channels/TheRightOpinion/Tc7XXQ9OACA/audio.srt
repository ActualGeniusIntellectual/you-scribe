1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,920
We're going to talk about something more serious now.

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,680
Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time,

3
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:13,880
and let's talk about the jolly old depression.

4
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:17,080
It's been a while since I've spoken about mental health, but we're returning to it today,

5
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:20,920
mainly because of a few comments that I've seen, and the debate it subsequently inspires.

6
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:24,920
This man is Andrew Tate. He is a cruiserweight and heavyweight kickboxer from Chicago.

7
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:29,960
He has attracted controversy with his recent statements on depression, that were certainly divisive to say the least.

8
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,320
Let's get the tweet up itself.

9
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,680
Now this provoked thousands of responses, 21,000 to be precise, which doesn't necessarily surprise me.

10
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:46,640
He goes on to argue his point about how depression stems from a dissatisfaction from life,

11
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,880
and the lethargy from these people towards changing it, and how it is that person's responsibility to change it as well.

12
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,720
He also went on Paul Joseph Watson's channel and argued his case.

13
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:59,080
Now Paul Joseph Watson urged people to watch the whole video before passing judgement, so I did.

14
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:04,040
Now the first thing I think it is important to say is that you don't have to be an expert to necessarily comment on these affairs.

15
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:07,560
There's plenty of leeway in the debate for people of many persuasions to weigh in,

16
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,840
so I understand where they're coming from on that one.

17
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,560
But let's cut to the chase. I watched the video, and I'll give them kudos,

18
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:17,040
because they put their arguments forward clearly, and I can understand it, so now I can actually retort.

19
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,240
The first point I picked up on was the overreliance on situational circumstances by Mr. Tate.

20
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,120
He heavily relies on the assumption that depression is situational,

21
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:27,680
and although I do believe that the situation can be considered as a factor,

22
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,600
it's a genuinely accepted actuality that there are many strains of depression that rely on interior mechanisms,

23
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:36,280
such as chemical imbalances that cause negative feelings to become inescapable.

24
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:40,880
If depression was solely based on the surroundings, you wouldn't see rich, successful people committing suicide.

25
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,440
But we do. Very successful people indeed, whom are unfortunately rather tortured on the inside.

26
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:49,960
Speaking from a personal perspective, I've become particularly depressed when I feel like I'm lacking progress in my life.

27
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,680
It happens a lot, and it's not something I'm necessarily happy with,

28
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,400
but it's not something you can simply click your fingers and change.

29
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:59,200
I'm working my ass off in everything I do currently, and as much as Tate might like to envision it,

30
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,760
just because you're talented and you do something good doesn't mean it's gonna work out.

31
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:06,000
It's the hard truth of life. Some people are incredibly skilled individuals,

32
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,760
but the truth of social mobility is a tough one to traverse.

33
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:13,240
Tate suggests that people can get healthy, start their own businesses, but that's a lot easier said than done,

34
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:17,000
and we have to acknowledge that a lot of people's attitudes are influenced by their upbringing,

35
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,200
and prospective students aren't really treated like possible entrepreneurs.

36
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,800
And I think it's shit, but there's a level of accountability that has to be down to the system,

37
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:27,640
and telling a depressed person to work harder is a huge oversimplification.

38
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:31,720
They also reference the rising rates of depression in the US. Now that's an important footnote,

39
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:35,280
but the false assumption they make there is that because depression diagnosis is on the rise,

40
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,760
depression must be on the rise. What they fail to consider are other variables,

41
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:42,680
such as the fact that people may just be more aware of depression and the treatments they can get,

42
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,960
and people may subsequently be more eager to seek medical help for it.

43
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:49,600
It cannot be denied that there is a massive drive in mental health awareness,

44
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:53,200
and given the increased awareness, diagnoses would be expected to go up.

45
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:59,640
Though 400% is a large number, it's not impossible for that number to be explained through extraneous variables alone, from my point of view.

46
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:03,640
Studies have found that after a positive event, someone's mood may improve temporarily,

47
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,840
but it often returns to the base rate afterwards.

48
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,400
What prevents me from being depressed is change in autonomy,

49
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,200
but very few people have the ability to be in that constant state of adaptation.

50
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,640
It'd be fucking cool, but it's just not possible.

51
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,960
Depression isn't a frame of mind for many people, it's something that isn't easily changeable,

52
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,840
and it's always existed in society.

53
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,960
Now, I'm not suggesting that that's the case with everyone,

54
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:27,080
and depression in the mood, and depression in the actual condition are very diverse predicaments,

55
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:30,320
but only one is really possible to address in any circumstance.

56
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:34,560
And even then, saying work harder is a hefty statement when many of them are working hard.

57
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,960
It's like telling a poor person to just get rich.

58
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,600
Depressed people and lazy people are by no means synonymous.

59
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:44,440
And even with that said, I think you'll be hard-pressed to find a relationship between income and depression rate,

60
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:47,600
and I know success isn't necessarily indicative of income, but there is a link.

61
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,080
It is something that you can measure.

62
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:53,320
My personal opinion is that depression and suicide are often contributed to by isolation,

63
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,120
and if you look at the suicide rates in America,

64
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,560
they are very worryingly, closely, negatively correlated to population density of each state.

65
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:02,320
However, people who are depressed may not necessarily report it,

66
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:07,000
so this skews the results to the point where suicide and depression themselves are very weakly correlated.

67
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,240
Now, correlation can not imply causation, but it's certainly food for thought.

68
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,320
You also have to note the importance of the word contribute.

69
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,880
You can live a happy family life and still be insanely depressed.

70
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,160
Unfortunately, some people can't change that.

71
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,040
I don't doubt that there is this existence of situational depression, but it's nothing new,

72
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:27,640
and I do think the doctors probably prescribe medication too liberally for depression rather than considering other treatments.

73
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:33,040
But starting off your thread with depression isn't real is going to be hammered by people because it's a universal statement,

74
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,640
and there cannot be denying that some people suffer depression no matter what situation they find themselves in,

75
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,440
and find it very hard to combat it.

76
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,480
And that's why, as I said earlier, even rich people commit suicide.

77
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:47,040
There was also this statement that suicides are increasing, and I understand that in the US they are.

78
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:52,880
However, in many countries, UK included, suicide rate has gone down despite prescription of antidepressants going up.

79
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:58,480
Depression is a hard topic. What we do know is that it's something that there is many causes and many strains that contribute to it,

80
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,400
some more chemical, some more situational.

81
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,760
And if you attempt to make it a black and white conversation,

82
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:08,600
you end up making a grossly reductionist comment that undermines what we have found out about depression in the last few decades.

83
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,320
I know it's not an easy topic to discuss, but it's not something that I rate Mr. Taiton.

84
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,960
Anyway, long video, that's all I have to say about depression.

85
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,040
I think it's an interesting topic, but one that has to be approached with caution.

86
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:23,360
All thoughts in the comments below are appreciated, but until then, I'm the right opinion, and I'll see you in the next one.
