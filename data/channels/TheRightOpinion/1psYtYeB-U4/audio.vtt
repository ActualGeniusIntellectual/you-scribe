00:00.000 --> 00:08.360
Hello ladies and gentlemen and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with

00:08.360 --> 00:09.880
too much free time.

00:09.880 --> 00:13.640
What is inherently wrong with going after bullies in game and giving them what's what?

00:13.640 --> 00:17.160
Well today we're going to investigate that and work out how such an organisation like

00:17.160 --> 00:21.140
Bully Hunters has arisen and how it's subsequently been lambasted by everyone.

00:21.140 --> 00:25.520
But before we get any further, to those who are out of the loop, what are Bully Hunters?

00:25.520 --> 00:28.480
Well the Bully Hunter campaign was set up in the light of harassment, basically what

00:28.480 --> 00:32.160
the method is, when you're in game and you're experiencing some twat for example, there's

00:32.160 --> 00:35.840
some spotty kid going to tell you to go in the kitchen and make a fucking sandwich, you

00:35.840 --> 00:39.160
go on the website and you go and call that Bully Hunter, that Bully Hunter links up with

00:39.160 --> 00:42.320
your steam so they can join your game and they deal with that fucking bully, they'll

00:42.320 --> 00:45.640
kill that fucking bully in game and leave them with a message saying that harassment

00:45.640 --> 00:49.600
will not be tolerated, capiche, the problem is no more.

00:49.600 --> 00:53.340
But why would there be a necessity for something like this in gamer culture?

00:53.340 --> 00:55.080
Why would we ever need that?

00:55.080 --> 00:58.280
Well maybe to understand that we have to go back in time a bit.

00:58.280 --> 01:02.660
So let's hop in the time machine and get some context, today we're going into real

01:02.660 --> 01:03.660
gamer hours.

01:11.660 --> 01:15.040
One of the most infamous associations with gamer culture, and something that was clearly

01:15.040 --> 01:19.860
rooted in the Bully Hunter campaign, is gamers and their supposed hostility, most notably

01:19.860 --> 01:20.860
to females.

01:20.860 --> 01:24.800
Now this is clearly rooted in some observable evidence, however a lot of people just observe

01:24.800 --> 01:28.720
this and point at it and say, it's a problem, rather than asking the deeper questions for

01:28.720 --> 01:30.000
why it has arisen.

01:30.000 --> 01:33.560
We should firstly question the nature that would create such an environment, where it's

01:33.560 --> 01:36.960
not too hard to understand how such a situation can arise.

01:36.960 --> 01:40.440
So let us list out a catalogue of prerequisites to fulfil.

01:40.440 --> 01:44.520
Firstly online gaming is competitive, there's an inherently important point to note.

01:44.520 --> 01:47.920
It's empirically proven that often when people compete against each other, they may not be

01:47.920 --> 01:51.300
the friendliest, especially when they feel that there is something to game, whether it's

01:51.300 --> 01:52.920
a reward or mere status.

01:52.920 --> 01:55.280
That is a primary condition for such an environment.

01:55.280 --> 01:59.000
Other gamers will apply many mental tactics to try and gain advantage over their opponent,

01:59.000 --> 02:02.720
especially when they're losing, which is why trash talk is much more likely to occur between

02:02.720 --> 02:06.520
teams rather than within teams, that's not to say it doesn't happen, but that's an important

02:06.520 --> 02:07.520
first point.

02:07.520 --> 02:11.000
The next point to make is that it's a lot easier to intimidate over the medium of a

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
video game.

02:12.000 --> 02:15.640
Your name is protected by an alias, and your identity is pretty much completely veiled.

02:15.640 --> 02:19.360
You do not know the people who you're interacting with, unless you're in a friends group of

02:19.360 --> 02:20.980
whom I assume you wouldn't bully.

02:20.980 --> 02:24.340
Whatever you say in these places will almost certainly not come back to you.

02:24.340 --> 02:27.940
Basically what that means is that when this culture is created, it can spread very quickly

02:27.940 --> 02:31.340
under the premise of anonymity, then we need to observe the demographics.

02:31.340 --> 02:33.980
Bully Under was promoted on Counter Strike Global Offensive.

02:33.980 --> 02:35.400
This is no coincidence.

02:35.400 --> 02:39.020
There is a largely male fanbase for many shooter games in particular, now there can be many

02:39.020 --> 02:42.740
hypotheses for why that is, but currently it is what it is.

02:42.740 --> 02:47.280
Then we infuse the fact that gamers on average are not generally as mature as the typical

02:47.280 --> 02:48.620
law abiding citizens.

02:48.620 --> 02:51.540
There is nothing intrinsically wrong with being slightly immature, I'd argue that

02:51.540 --> 02:55.300
I'm very juvenile from time to time, but you put all these together, and yes you're

02:55.300 --> 02:58.980
going to have some sort of outcome which may result in the verbal degradation of others

02:58.980 --> 02:59.980
around you.

02:59.980 --> 03:03.260
I don't think that's on gaming itself, I think that's on the very particular aesthetics

03:03.260 --> 03:07.500
that culminate around such an environment, which is magnified particularly in this scenario.

03:07.500 --> 03:11.660
So I don't believe the idea that certain things such as misogyny existing on a proportionally

03:11.660 --> 03:15.460
greater scale within such games is an unfounded one, but I do believe that it is something

03:15.460 --> 03:19.180
in need of more elaboration, and it should also be put into perspective.

03:19.180 --> 03:23.180
Human beings don't tend to go on to games with an agenda, and I think that's an important

03:23.180 --> 03:27.580
point, a very high majority of people do not go into games with the intention of abusing

03:27.580 --> 03:31.260
people or spreading toxic ideas, particularly the latter, you're not going to be using

03:31.260 --> 03:35.380
Counter Strike Global Offensive to recruit for your chauvinist cult to say the least.

03:35.380 --> 03:37.380
I'm not trying to give anyone any ideas.

03:37.380 --> 03:42.300
So then we have to question what is the ideological system behind these games, being the MVP,

03:42.300 --> 03:46.860
being the victors, being the best, shooters in particular are very domination oriented,

03:46.860 --> 03:50.340
many want to assert themselves as in charge, and therefore this will lead to them taking

03:50.340 --> 03:54.260
up a character of what they perceive to be the most successful in-game persona, this

03:54.260 --> 03:56.220
is obviously the alpha male.

03:56.220 --> 03:59.260
However given the fact that many of these people's understanding of what it takes

03:59.260 --> 04:03.480
to be an alpha male is somewhat two dimensional, it'll often lead to quote abuse tactics

04:03.480 --> 04:08.160
in a direct attempt to subjugate their opposites, which is why although misogyny may be observed

04:08.160 --> 04:13.000
as more precedent, it would not surprise me if abuse in general was higher across the

04:13.000 --> 04:16.960
board, particularly male on male, and even female on male, if I were to take a guess

04:16.960 --> 04:21.320
most abuse would revolve around players calling each other virgins, going after their libido,

04:21.320 --> 04:23.920
presenting them as effeminate and unsuccessful.

04:23.920 --> 04:27.240
However one of the greatest mistakes in my opinion is then assuming that the game is

04:27.240 --> 04:31.400
the sole cause of the behaviour, this is also an important point and there is a lot of important

04:31.400 --> 04:35.000
points that you need to put together in your head today because we are putting the pieces

04:35.000 --> 04:36.400
of a puzzle together.

04:36.400 --> 04:39.480
Just because something may create an environment where it can happen, doesn't mean it will

04:39.480 --> 04:43.420
happen, now for all you lads coming down to education corner with me the right opinion,

04:43.420 --> 04:47.560
this is something known as retrospective determinism, don't pull this out of your ass all the

04:47.560 --> 04:51.480
time but it's a fun little fact and little word nugget to make you feel a bit smarter.

04:51.480 --> 04:54.880
If abuse is higher proportionally, it's hard to say that it's something specifically

04:54.880 --> 04:59.320
pertaining to gender, and moreover a Darwinistic drive for dominance within a game that implicitly

04:59.320 --> 05:00.920
promotes hierarchy.

05:00.920 --> 05:04.000
However it wouldn't be right to talk about this without talking about the other topics

05:04.000 --> 05:07.640
that are often conflated, which I personally believe to be a very different matter but

05:07.640 --> 05:13.580
due to the correlation a causal link is often drawn, which is obviously, out of game, politics.

05:13.580 --> 05:17.240
Now video games are at a very unique position within their market, they're not centralised

05:17.240 --> 05:20.760
in the sort of Hollywood bubble and therefore haven't been dominated by a lot of progressive

05:20.760 --> 05:25.220
politics associated with that, however journalism in particular seems very driven to subscribe

05:25.220 --> 05:29.800
to those ideas, nonetheless this has not come without its resistance and many seem very

05:29.800 --> 05:32.300
defiant to preserve certain aspects of game.

05:32.300 --> 05:36.780
Now to speak about politics, you have to speak about gamergate, a scandal which pitted these

05:36.780 --> 05:39.120
two very distinct sects against each other.

05:39.120 --> 05:42.440
Now I do not wish to speak too much about it specifically because I was not there and

05:42.440 --> 05:46.880
it appears to be a situation which is really fucking hard to find an unbiased testimony,

05:46.880 --> 05:50.680
with all that in mind I still see people talking about the topic today, with many advocates

05:50.680 --> 05:54.760
still romanticising over it in an attempt to present themselves as martyrs.

05:54.760 --> 05:58.340
There has often been a lot of retrospective reframing of what has happened and people

05:58.340 --> 06:02.260
attempting to construct a podium out of it to launch their careers, I'm not gonna name

06:02.260 --> 06:05.340
any names but it's pretty fucking obvious.

06:05.340 --> 06:09.380
Anyhow this has led to the constantly renewing debate of sexism within the games industry,

06:09.380 --> 06:13.180
but what this seems to forget is that many gamers that I've exemplified earlier in this

06:13.180 --> 06:17.360
video are not remotely political, they're just juvenile, some of which I'm sure have

06:17.360 --> 06:21.940
never even heard of gamergate, back in 2013 the only way I had heard of gamergate was

06:21.940 --> 06:25.860
through the Angry Joe show, I genuinely didn't know what he was talking about, so all this

06:25.860 --> 06:29.380
basically leads to back and forth between Twitter pseudo intellectuals on stuff that

06:29.380 --> 06:33.620
is really rather ineffectual to many people who do not use these websites, and believe

06:33.620 --> 06:37.340
me, there are many places where sites like Twitter are not overwhelmingly popular, where

06:37.340 --> 06:41.140
I'm from in particular, we're almost all resident on Facebook, and I'm the exception.

06:41.140 --> 06:44.840
But while this is all transpiring, these sorts of people, the journalists, are all looking

06:44.840 --> 06:49.780
for a way to combat what they see as the rampant aggression within games, but by kinda responding

06:49.780 --> 06:54.020
to something that is actually quite psychologically rooted and treating it with the heavy hand

06:54.020 --> 06:58.060
of politicisation, this can lead to many ham-fisted attempts to try and prevent toxic

06:58.060 --> 07:02.360
mentalities, and I think it's necessary to discuss how it's escalated to that point,

07:02.360 --> 07:07.940
and then we will get to the magnum opus, Bully Hunter, and how such a tame movement became

07:07.940 --> 07:16.540
the breaking point for the strain on the gaming community.

07:16.540 --> 07:21.180
Everyone knows about the debates that arise from gamers, games, and so on, now as observed

07:21.180 --> 07:24.580
I've noted that there has been a certain stigma raised around the gaming community,

07:24.580 --> 07:27.920
particularly on the image created by a lot of its detractors when presenting the issues

07:27.920 --> 07:28.920
such as harassment.

07:28.920 --> 07:31.220
Let's discuss how this response has evolved over time.

07:31.220 --> 07:34.780
One of the primary responses adopted by a lot of reactionaries was to immediately blame

07:34.780 --> 07:38.300
the games they were playing, and I explained why this is a mostly false narrative in another

07:38.300 --> 07:41.180
one of my videos, so I'm not going to touch on it too much now, but it should be quite

07:41.180 --> 07:44.900
clear that from what I've presented that it's not games themselves that cause the dangerous

07:44.900 --> 07:45.900
mentalities.

07:45.900 --> 07:50.300
And yes, there are instances in which unhinged individuals carried out crimes mimicking video

07:50.300 --> 07:53.100
games, but many of those individuals were shown to be rather delusional in their own

07:53.100 --> 07:55.620
capacity without the assistance of video games.

07:55.620 --> 07:59.340
However, this has not stopped them from nailing in the narrative, most recently in the light

07:59.340 --> 08:03.660
of the Parkland shooting, although that legacy appears to be dying a very horrible death

08:03.660 --> 08:04.700
very rapidly.

08:04.700 --> 08:08.260
Many have suggested boycotting games that might include a high level of violence, harassment,

08:08.260 --> 08:11.060
and other suggestive ideologies such as misogyny.

08:11.060 --> 08:15.420
Famously, an Australian petition made Target remove GTA 5 from their shelves completely,

08:15.420 --> 08:18.480
because many didn't like the way the game framed the treatment of women.

08:18.480 --> 08:22.760
Now call me Nostradamus, but I expect the implications of such a move to be absolutely

08:22.760 --> 08:27.320
zilched, in spite of its earnest intentions, however this was the case of a society that

08:27.320 --> 08:29.900
didn't really completely grasp the nature of video games.

08:29.900 --> 08:33.600
It always happens whenever something new and perhaps controversial is introduced, people

08:33.600 --> 08:37.520
will jump in, convinced it will lead to the inevitable destruction of society as we know

08:37.520 --> 08:38.520
it.

08:38.520 --> 08:41.360
And as we have become more familiarised with this, there has been a shift away from this

08:41.360 --> 08:46.280
responsibility on games, and many people generally understand that there is not much of a causal

08:46.280 --> 08:50.280
relationship, though there are some people who like to push the blame whenever it's convenient

08:50.280 --> 08:51.480
for their agenda.

08:51.480 --> 08:55.120
So eventually people moved away from that, after all, most people project themselves

08:55.120 --> 08:59.280
onto video games and not vice versa, the video game may activate the behaviour, but it was

08:59.280 --> 09:03.040
still within the person, and yes sure there are some young kids who might be impressionable,

09:03.040 --> 09:06.880
but I would make the argument that the responsibility lies on the parent to make sure that their

09:06.880 --> 09:09.600
child behaves sensibly and not on the state.

09:09.600 --> 09:10.600
So what now?

09:10.600 --> 09:15.120
I said earlier we have two very separate concepts, politicisation of games and competition within

09:15.120 --> 09:17.400
games, both of which cause great debate.

09:17.400 --> 09:20.960
Gaming as an industry is primarily male, as I have said there are likely many explanations

09:20.960 --> 09:24.960
for that, however given the recent drive for equal representation within industries it

09:24.960 --> 09:29.080
has faced fierce criticism for its current make-up, however the campaign within the games

09:29.080 --> 09:32.800
industry has seemed much more personal than many others, if you talk about the gender

09:32.800 --> 09:37.120
pay gap in banking for example, you wouldn't talk about the regional managers, even other

09:37.120 --> 09:41.340
media persuasions such as television and music have faced much less controversy in how they

09:41.340 --> 09:42.920
handle such topics.

09:42.920 --> 09:43.920
Why is this?

09:43.920 --> 09:47.180
Because of the overlap that I have been talking about, whereas many industries such as TV

09:47.180 --> 09:51.040
haven't been excessively criticised as a culture for the issues discussed today, the gaming

09:51.040 --> 09:55.020
industry is often alleged to have this sort of bad aura about it, probably because it

09:55.020 --> 09:58.060
doesn't have the same filter that other industries have on.

09:58.060 --> 10:02.080
Gamers are much more integral to the games, you wouldn't have the viewers or the listeners

10:02.080 --> 10:06.060
for example being the centrepiece in your content when we're talking about film or music.

10:06.060 --> 10:09.800
Gamers on the other hand are very central, and they're not always politically correct,

10:09.800 --> 10:13.360
and eventually many journalists in particular assumed the best way to combat this was to

10:13.400 --> 10:17.180
actually try and project their agendas into the content, and that just didn't work, either

10:17.180 --> 10:21.280
leading to the tiresome twitter threads mentioned earlier or just shouting loudly into an echo

10:21.280 --> 10:22.280
chamber.

10:22.280 --> 10:26.240
But mostly what this overlap between politicisation and casual gamers yielded was either backlash

10:26.240 --> 10:30.400
or no reaction whatsoever, because although there may have been people participating in

10:30.400 --> 10:34.040
the sort of alpha male projection that we can witness, it didn't reflect genuine beliefs

10:34.040 --> 10:37.440
of any sort, and they are behaviours that many a person would inevitably grow out of

10:37.440 --> 10:38.440
regardless.

10:38.440 --> 10:42.160
You had the campaigns to deal with the in-game attitude and aggression, violence, etc, and

10:42.160 --> 10:44.560
you had the out-of-game push for diversification.

10:44.560 --> 10:48.360
Much of the out-of-game conflict was projected onto in-game assets, which as I expressed

10:48.360 --> 10:51.240
earlier I believe to be the result of a very different cause.

10:51.240 --> 10:55.200
However, no one wanted to nuance that sector, and it regularly became a pastime for many

10:55.200 --> 10:59.360
journalists to go in on gamers with no real plan, as if complaining about them on a web

10:59.360 --> 11:01.000
article would solve their problem.

11:01.000 --> 11:04.840
This led to the creation of caricatures that firstly didn't represent many gamers, and

11:04.840 --> 11:08.240
secondly didn't even reflect the nature of the political opposition that their own

11:08.240 --> 11:09.440
agendas faced.

11:09.440 --> 11:12.680
In the end, they just pissed people off who'd never heard of their arguments, and first

11:12.680 --> 11:15.040
impressions are pretty fucking important.

11:15.040 --> 11:18.520
When people get pissed, they didn't think to evaluate the arguments, which even if they

11:18.520 --> 11:22.240
had some validity, were presented in the most sanctimonious way possible.

11:22.240 --> 11:24.840
So, with all that in mind, what do they do?

11:24.840 --> 11:27.920
There's clearly a rift that needs to be abridged.

11:27.920 --> 11:30.820
Was it time for someone to grab the ball by the horns?

11:30.820 --> 11:34.640
One day, someone was sitting down looking over their condominium and thinking, how do

11:34.640 --> 11:41.180
I really take out all these horrible, racist, sexist gamers who constantly belittle my existence?

11:41.180 --> 11:44.520
How do we make gaming a welcome environment for everyone?

11:44.520 --> 11:48.480
Instead of going on Polygon and writing some argument lamenting the latest offensive trend

11:48.480 --> 11:51.840
that will probably be irrelevant in a few months time, they thought, you know what?

11:51.840 --> 11:57.400
We're gonna take the battle to them, and we're gonna make them stop being bullies.

11:57.400 --> 11:58.400
We're gonna hunt them.

11:58.400 --> 12:13.400
Bully Hunter has to be one of the worst ideas that has ever come to mind, and yet, only

12:13.400 --> 12:18.400
in the twisted world that we reside in could it have A, ever happened, and B, ever faced

12:18.400 --> 12:19.840
such a reaction.

12:19.840 --> 12:21.300
But let's break that down.

12:21.300 --> 12:25.280
Going after people who are being cunts in game on the surface does not sound like a

12:25.280 --> 12:26.280
disastrous idea.

12:26.280 --> 12:30.480
If I was to sit down with you and say, let's go after people being rude bellends and give

12:30.480 --> 12:33.360
them what for, it would probably be a pretty lit time.

12:33.360 --> 12:37.160
I want to say that Bully Hunter went one step further, but I think that would be underselling

12:37.160 --> 12:39.180
how many steps further they went.

12:39.180 --> 12:43.280
Let's just map this out, a serious organisation that stops people harassing by killing them

12:43.280 --> 12:44.280
in game.

12:44.280 --> 12:48.040
In the demonstration, you can hear the apprehension in the applause when the audience realised

12:48.040 --> 12:49.520
what they had witnessed.

12:49.520 --> 12:51.560
But why has this happened?

12:51.560 --> 12:55.880
Well, as I said, it's kind of grown out of the intent to get the gamers.

12:55.880 --> 12:59.440
Despite having really nothing to do with what a lot of these journalists claimed to

12:59.440 --> 13:03.680
be concerned about, presented with the strawmans that had been constructed, they decided that

13:03.680 --> 13:07.920
they were going to make gaming a safer space for everyone, and go after some bullies.

13:07.920 --> 13:13.360
But gaming, and more importantly, bully hunting, didn't work how they envisioned it.

13:13.360 --> 13:14.360
Let's break it down.

13:14.360 --> 13:17.260
Firstly, when you experience the harassment, you can call on the Bully Hunter.

13:17.260 --> 13:22.060
This raises immediate red flags, as it makes you question, well, what constitutes harassment,

13:22.060 --> 13:24.800
How does the Bully Hunter know that a report is honest?

13:24.800 --> 13:27.020
How is it not completely open to exploitation?

13:27.020 --> 13:30.760
If someone has a grudge and wants to make a false report, can they just do that?

13:30.760 --> 13:32.820
How can someone not impersonate a Bully Hunter?

13:32.820 --> 13:36.420
Anyone can change their stream tag, it's not rocket science if the game's full.

13:36.420 --> 13:37.740
Do they just wait to join?

13:37.740 --> 13:40.140
What if the game finishes, and what if you leave the game?

13:40.140 --> 13:41.140
Where do they go?

13:41.140 --> 13:44.980
The stream didn't show the Bully Hunter gauging the situation before acting, just jumping

13:44.980 --> 13:45.980
in and killing the person.

13:45.980 --> 13:50.460
This also brings in the point that the person making the report can hold the Bully Hunter

13:50.460 --> 13:51.460
to rating ransom.

13:51.860 --> 13:52.860
What do I mean by this?

13:52.860 --> 13:56.100
Well, if you can call in the Bully Hunter, you can subsequently rate them on their job

13:56.100 --> 13:57.340
of eliminating the threat.

13:57.340 --> 14:00.520
But in a competitive environment, this no longer becomes a question of how well they

14:00.520 --> 14:04.300
do the job, rather how well they fulfill their client's desires.

14:04.300 --> 14:07.520
Now to that, some might say, well, what's the problem with doing what the client wants?

14:07.520 --> 14:09.420
In most occupations, I would agree.

14:09.420 --> 14:13.060
But in this one, it directly involves dealing with someone else in an environment that makes

14:13.060 --> 14:14.920
a person inherently biased.

14:14.920 --> 14:17.600
So yes, a rating system is a terrible idea.

14:17.600 --> 14:20.900
This would be a more prominent issue in itself if it wasn't overshadowed by an issue that

14:21.340 --> 14:22.340
renders this borderline invalid.

14:22.340 --> 14:26.740
The fact that the idea of the Bully Hunters dealing with the bullies is killing them in

14:26.740 --> 14:29.820
game, and then leaving them with a disparaging message.

14:29.820 --> 14:30.820
That is it.

14:30.820 --> 14:32.740
Let's break down the numerous problems with this.

14:32.740 --> 14:36.900
The idea that killing someone in game that focuses around killing people is rather insubstantial.

14:36.900 --> 14:40.500
That would be like punishing someone in football by tackling them.

14:40.500 --> 14:41.780
It's kind of the point already.

14:41.780 --> 14:45.740
And yes, you could argue that it is more specifically targeted, which could irritate the player.

14:45.740 --> 14:50.400
But in a game like CSGO, being killed is commonplace that it really wouldn't make the gamer reconsider

14:50.400 --> 14:52.600
their position on in-game verbal abuse.

14:52.600 --> 14:56.240
In fact, they were probably pissed off, it'd probably make them more pissed off, and thus

14:56.240 --> 14:57.560
more abusive.

14:57.560 --> 15:01.240
Often such abuse is compensated anyway, a lot of these kids trying to make up for the

15:01.240 --> 15:02.840
fact that they're having a shit game.

15:02.840 --> 15:06.200
A real gamer ain't gotta prove they're real as long as they know it.

15:06.200 --> 15:10.320
So the virgins that you probably go after dying once more would have little to no effect

15:10.320 --> 15:14.320
on their mentality, and if the gamer is actually accomplished, then surely the Bully Hunter

15:14.320 --> 15:16.840
isn't invincible, surely they can die too.

15:16.840 --> 15:20.440
This is actually empirically supported by studies that state men who are having a bad

15:20.440 --> 15:22.400
game are more likely to act aggressively.

15:22.400 --> 15:26.040
I don't know about you lads and lasses, but if I've had a bad game, it's much more

15:26.040 --> 15:29.040
probable for me to come off a bit livid.

15:29.040 --> 15:46.080
Also, the message that the Bully Hunter leaves refers exactly to the reason that they have

15:46.080 --> 15:50.300
been hunted, and now they know they've upset someone to the point of calling in other people

15:50.300 --> 15:51.300
to save them.

15:51.300 --> 15:53.560
They're just going harder and harder and harder.

15:53.560 --> 15:58.320
The Bully Hunters did a livestream where everything went surprisingly, well, suspiciously smooth,

15:58.320 --> 16:01.400
and although it's not something that they could immediately prove as fake, the bullies

16:01.400 --> 16:03.720
seemed extremely cliche to say the least.

16:03.720 --> 16:07.280
Now the point in cliches is that they do exist, but on top of that, the fact that they had

16:07.280 --> 16:12.000
absolutely no problems with such an observably flawed concept made it highly questionable,

16:12.000 --> 16:15.740
and many Counter-Strike gamers, especially experienced ones, call it fake.

16:15.740 --> 16:19.980
Now in response, one of the livestream hosts, Zombie Unicorn, said that she flooded a line

16:19.980 --> 16:21.580
emphasising it was fake.

16:21.580 --> 16:22.580
That is bullshit.

16:22.580 --> 16:26.700
And alright, you can't do anything outside the realms of what the game allows you to

16:26.700 --> 16:27.700
do.

16:27.700 --> 16:28.700
What else can they do?

16:28.700 --> 16:31.340
This is a fair question, but just because you can't answer it immediately doesn't

16:31.340 --> 16:34.060
mean that any compromise is necessarily worth investing in.

16:34.060 --> 16:37.140
As speaking of investors, let's talk about how that's turning out, shall we?

16:37.140 --> 16:40.220
I remember when I saw a pair of headphones being advertised in my feed and I thought

16:40.220 --> 16:42.680
to myself, how will wearing headphones end bullying?

16:42.680 --> 16:46.720
This was before the Bully Hunters controversy transpired, so I was genuinely clueless of

16:46.720 --> 16:47.940
what the point was.

16:47.940 --> 16:51.640
Now I have some clarity with regards to it, it makes the situation even more laughable.

16:51.640 --> 16:55.840
Upon the tidal wave of criticism approaching them, the Prime sponsors who made the headphones

16:55.840 --> 17:00.760
steal series completely withdrew their support and published a remorseful Facebook post reflecting

17:00.760 --> 17:01.760
their involvement.

17:01.760 --> 17:06.080
They, like myself, touch on some important discussion, and that will transition us into

17:06.080 --> 17:07.280
our next points.

17:07.280 --> 17:11.720
Why did it receive such attention for a project that in theory seems so modest?

17:11.760 --> 17:13.760
Because it was a crossover.

17:13.760 --> 17:18.640
The pinnacle crossover between out of game activism and in game realism, most gamers

17:18.640 --> 17:22.140
just want a game, most gamers do not give a shit about this and do not want to give

17:22.140 --> 17:23.140
a shit about this.

17:23.140 --> 17:27.260
Now certain individuals have often been criticised for misrepresenting the game sphere, however

17:27.260 --> 17:30.800
if you're one of those people who has done that, you're somewhat safe in the ivory

17:30.800 --> 17:34.800
tower you have constructed for yourself, because to bitch about gamers is so broad that you

17:34.800 --> 17:37.480
can say a lot without being called out.

17:37.480 --> 17:41.480
However as soon as you go in game, the ivory tower comes tumbling down.

17:41.480 --> 17:45.080
And their naivety to these gaming environments is desperately exposed.

17:45.080 --> 17:49.360
Most importantly, it finally brought that in game and out of game backlash together.

17:49.360 --> 17:53.200
Everyone from PewDiePie to the Chicago Tribune were commenting on it, and the flaws were

17:53.200 --> 17:54.880
out in the open to scrutinise.

17:54.880 --> 17:59.120
I highly doubt that they will have the humility to take anything away from this, but maybe

17:59.120 --> 18:03.200
this will bring some insight to the actual in game truths rather than the expectations

18:03.200 --> 18:05.380
implanted from an outsider's point of view.

18:05.380 --> 18:09.280
This instant does cater to the narrative that many people who write these articles have

18:09.280 --> 18:13.540
very little exposure to the actual environment, or seem to exaggerate the victimhood that

18:13.540 --> 18:14.540
does occur.

18:14.540 --> 18:18.380
If I wanted to go and shoot some people in game who were being cunts, it would be fine

18:18.380 --> 18:23.060
for some short term amusement, but it would be for my amusement, and I would totally anticipate

18:23.060 --> 18:25.120
being barraged by hate due to it.

18:25.120 --> 18:28.920
On top of that, if I said to them, I'll stop killing you if you stop being rude, I

18:28.920 --> 18:32.160
think the reply I received may include a few expletives.

18:32.160 --> 18:36.600
Harassment is shit, but some people go into these games looking to be the antithesis of

18:36.600 --> 18:37.600
victims.

18:37.600 --> 18:40.840
If you tell these virgins exactly where they can shove it, there's a difference that

18:40.840 --> 18:45.940
you cannot really apprehend how to deal with something so abstract as in game aggression.

18:45.940 --> 18:50.400
The whole situation inevitably leaves the gaming world in a weird place, and maybe,

18:50.400 --> 18:55.160
maybe for a brief moment, people will be able to see the reality over the lampoons.

18:55.160 --> 18:58.880
People want to do these campaigns with more power to them, but understand the relativity

18:58.880 --> 19:03.320
of it, and stop attacking or mischaracterising people who have very little interest in your

19:03.320 --> 19:06.020
agenda, because it just opposes them to you.

19:06.020 --> 19:09.860
And if you want people to hear you out, you have to separate them from your already existing

19:09.860 --> 19:11.500
critics, and appeal to them.

19:11.500 --> 19:15.300
They may not agree, but at least they wouldn't be alienated, and you wouldn't be embarrassed

19:15.300 --> 19:19.140
when you tried to create depictions of how they actually behave.

19:19.140 --> 19:22.060
Chances are that the people in the wrong, well, if you believe they're in the wrong

19:22.060 --> 19:26.220
that is, will go back to mudslinging in the columns, and then questioning why people aren't

19:26.220 --> 19:27.220
at war with them.

19:27.220 --> 19:30.140
It's clear that that's a cycle that they're much more comfortable with.

19:30.140 --> 19:33.540
What has occurred is people identifying the problem, but not really asking themselves

19:33.540 --> 19:37.620
how and why, then conflating their agenda, and then pointing fingers at people that really

19:37.620 --> 19:41.180
have much less to do with it than they think they do, and eventually creating something

19:41.180 --> 19:44.060
that completely exposes that flawed line of thinking.

19:44.060 --> 19:47.220
As I've noted, there are many reasons that such an environment can arise.

19:47.220 --> 19:51.300
The in-game goals, the competitiveness, the person themselves, but that is an inherently

19:51.300 --> 19:55.180
natural outcome from the society that we live in today, and you really have to look much

19:55.180 --> 19:59.460
beyond the mentality of video games, and more towards social causes, if you ever wanted

19:59.460 --> 20:00.900
to change and address that.

20:00.940 --> 20:04.620
And make no mistake, you may not be able to change that, and even if you can, it would

20:04.620 --> 20:10.260
be an incredibly challenging task, but that doesn't mean you settle for really bad compromises,

20:10.260 --> 20:13.700
and I don't mean like going for second best, because there may be some other options that

20:13.700 --> 20:18.540
could work, but this option clearly doesn't, and it just rubs everyone the wrong way.

20:18.540 --> 20:22.620
So maybe it's just time to change the narrative, and change the tone that you're taking when

20:22.620 --> 20:25.860
dealing with these issues that you know exist.

20:25.860 --> 20:27.820
You're not perfect either, just saying.

20:27.820 --> 20:30.660
Either way, I would love to hear what you think of this topic.

20:30.660 --> 20:34.740
Let me know down below in the little lovely bloody comment section, and a massive thanks

20:34.740 --> 20:37.940
to the editors who have made this magic happen once again.

20:37.940 --> 20:41.420
Keep up the great work blokes, and thank you so much for all your support of recent, it's

20:41.420 --> 20:44.300
been really special, and I'm glad to be back.

20:44.300 --> 20:45.580
Makes me feel welcome.

20:45.580 --> 20:48.940
So let me know what you think, I'm always open to discussion, I'd love to hear your

20:48.940 --> 20:49.940
point of view.

20:49.940 --> 20:53.580
However, until then, I'm The Right Opinion, and I'll see you in the next one.

21:00.660 --> 21:03.140
Bye.
