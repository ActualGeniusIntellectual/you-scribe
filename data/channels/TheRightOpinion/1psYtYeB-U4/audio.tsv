0	8360	Hello ladies and gentlemen and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with
8360	9880	too much free time.
9880	13640	What is inherently wrong with going after bullies in game and giving them what's what?
13640	17160	Well today we're going to investigate that and work out how such an organisation like
17160	21140	Bully Hunters has arisen and how it's subsequently been lambasted by everyone.
21140	25520	But before we get any further, to those who are out of the loop, what are Bully Hunters?
25520	28480	Well the Bully Hunter campaign was set up in the light of harassment, basically what
28480	32160	the method is, when you're in game and you're experiencing some twat for example, there's
32160	35840	some spotty kid going to tell you to go in the kitchen and make a fucking sandwich, you
35840	39160	go on the website and you go and call that Bully Hunter, that Bully Hunter links up with
39160	42320	your steam so they can join your game and they deal with that fucking bully, they'll
42320	45640	kill that fucking bully in game and leave them with a message saying that harassment
45640	49600	will not be tolerated, capiche, the problem is no more.
49600	53340	But why would there be a necessity for something like this in gamer culture?
53340	55080	Why would we ever need that?
55080	58280	Well maybe to understand that we have to go back in time a bit.
58280	62660	So let's hop in the time machine and get some context, today we're going into real
62660	63660	gamer hours.
71660	75040	One of the most infamous associations with gamer culture, and something that was clearly
75040	79860	rooted in the Bully Hunter campaign, is gamers and their supposed hostility, most notably
79860	80860	to females.
80860	84800	Now this is clearly rooted in some observable evidence, however a lot of people just observe
84800	88720	this and point at it and say, it's a problem, rather than asking the deeper questions for
88720	90000	why it has arisen.
90000	93560	We should firstly question the nature that would create such an environment, where it's
93560	96960	not too hard to understand how such a situation can arise.
96960	100440	So let us list out a catalogue of prerequisites to fulfil.
100440	104520	Firstly online gaming is competitive, there's an inherently important point to note.
104520	107920	It's empirically proven that often when people compete against each other, they may not be
107920	111300	the friendliest, especially when they feel that there is something to game, whether it's
111300	112920	a reward or mere status.
112920	115280	That is a primary condition for such an environment.
115280	119000	Other gamers will apply many mental tactics to try and gain advantage over their opponent,
119000	122720	especially when they're losing, which is why trash talk is much more likely to occur between
122720	126520	teams rather than within teams, that's not to say it doesn't happen, but that's an important
126520	127520	first point.
127520	131000	The next point to make is that it's a lot easier to intimidate over the medium of a
131000	132000	video game.
132000	135640	Your name is protected by an alias, and your identity is pretty much completely veiled.
135640	139360	You do not know the people who you're interacting with, unless you're in a friends group of
139360	140980	whom I assume you wouldn't bully.
140980	144340	Whatever you say in these places will almost certainly not come back to you.
144340	147940	Basically what that means is that when this culture is created, it can spread very quickly
147940	151340	under the premise of anonymity, then we need to observe the demographics.
151340	153980	Bully Under was promoted on Counter Strike Global Offensive.
153980	155400	This is no coincidence.
155400	159020	There is a largely male fanbase for many shooter games in particular, now there can be many
159020	162740	hypotheses for why that is, but currently it is what it is.
162740	167280	Then we infuse the fact that gamers on average are not generally as mature as the typical
167280	168620	law abiding citizens.
168620	171540	There is nothing intrinsically wrong with being slightly immature, I'd argue that
171540	175300	I'm very juvenile from time to time, but you put all these together, and yes you're
175300	178980	going to have some sort of outcome which may result in the verbal degradation of others
178980	179980	around you.
179980	183260	I don't think that's on gaming itself, I think that's on the very particular aesthetics
183260	187500	that culminate around such an environment, which is magnified particularly in this scenario.
187500	191660	So I don't believe the idea that certain things such as misogyny existing on a proportionally
191660	195460	greater scale within such games is an unfounded one, but I do believe that it is something
195460	199180	in need of more elaboration, and it should also be put into perspective.
199180	203180	Human beings don't tend to go on to games with an agenda, and I think that's an important
203180	207580	point, a very high majority of people do not go into games with the intention of abusing
207580	211260	people or spreading toxic ideas, particularly the latter, you're not going to be using
211260	215380	Counter Strike Global Offensive to recruit for your chauvinist cult to say the least.
215380	217380	I'm not trying to give anyone any ideas.
217380	222300	So then we have to question what is the ideological system behind these games, being the MVP,
222300	226860	being the victors, being the best, shooters in particular are very domination oriented,
226860	230340	many want to assert themselves as in charge, and therefore this will lead to them taking
230340	234260	up a character of what they perceive to be the most successful in-game persona, this
234260	236220	is obviously the alpha male.
236220	239260	However given the fact that many of these people's understanding of what it takes
239260	243480	to be an alpha male is somewhat two dimensional, it'll often lead to quote abuse tactics
243480	248160	in a direct attempt to subjugate their opposites, which is why although misogyny may be observed
248160	253000	as more precedent, it would not surprise me if abuse in general was higher across the
253000	256960	board, particularly male on male, and even female on male, if I were to take a guess
256960	261320	most abuse would revolve around players calling each other virgins, going after their libido,
261320	263920	presenting them as effeminate and unsuccessful.
263920	267240	However one of the greatest mistakes in my opinion is then assuming that the game is
267240	271400	the sole cause of the behaviour, this is also an important point and there is a lot of important
271400	275000	points that you need to put together in your head today because we are putting the pieces
275000	276400	of a puzzle together.
276400	279480	Just because something may create an environment where it can happen, doesn't mean it will
279480	283420	happen, now for all you lads coming down to education corner with me the right opinion,
283420	287560	this is something known as retrospective determinism, don't pull this out of your ass all the
287560	291480	time but it's a fun little fact and little word nugget to make you feel a bit smarter.
291480	294880	If abuse is higher proportionally, it's hard to say that it's something specifically
294880	299320	pertaining to gender, and moreover a Darwinistic drive for dominance within a game that implicitly
299320	300920	promotes hierarchy.
300920	304000	However it wouldn't be right to talk about this without talking about the other topics
304000	307640	that are often conflated, which I personally believe to be a very different matter but
307640	313580	due to the correlation a causal link is often drawn, which is obviously, out of game, politics.
313580	317240	Now video games are at a very unique position within their market, they're not centralised
317240	320760	in the sort of Hollywood bubble and therefore haven't been dominated by a lot of progressive
320760	325220	politics associated with that, however journalism in particular seems very driven to subscribe
325220	329800	to those ideas, nonetheless this has not come without its resistance and many seem very
329800	332300	defiant to preserve certain aspects of game.
332300	336780	Now to speak about politics, you have to speak about gamergate, a scandal which pitted these
336780	339120	two very distinct sects against each other.
339120	342440	Now I do not wish to speak too much about it specifically because I was not there and
342440	346880	it appears to be a situation which is really fucking hard to find an unbiased testimony,
346880	350680	with all that in mind I still see people talking about the topic today, with many advocates
350680	354760	still romanticising over it in an attempt to present themselves as martyrs.
354760	358340	There has often been a lot of retrospective reframing of what has happened and people
358340	362260	attempting to construct a podium out of it to launch their careers, I'm not gonna name
362260	365340	any names but it's pretty fucking obvious.
365340	369380	Anyhow this has led to the constantly renewing debate of sexism within the games industry,
369380	373180	but what this seems to forget is that many gamers that I've exemplified earlier in this
373180	377360	video are not remotely political, they're just juvenile, some of which I'm sure have
377360	381940	never even heard of gamergate, back in 2013 the only way I had heard of gamergate was
381940	385860	through the Angry Joe show, I genuinely didn't know what he was talking about, so all this
385860	389380	basically leads to back and forth between Twitter pseudo intellectuals on stuff that
389380	393620	is really rather ineffectual to many people who do not use these websites, and believe
393620	397340	me, there are many places where sites like Twitter are not overwhelmingly popular, where
397340	401140	I'm from in particular, we're almost all resident on Facebook, and I'm the exception.
401140	404840	But while this is all transpiring, these sorts of people, the journalists, are all looking
404840	409780	for a way to combat what they see as the rampant aggression within games, but by kinda responding
409780	414020	to something that is actually quite psychologically rooted and treating it with the heavy hand
414020	418060	of politicisation, this can lead to many ham-fisted attempts to try and prevent toxic
418060	422360	mentalities, and I think it's necessary to discuss how it's escalated to that point,
422360	427940	and then we will get to the magnum opus, Bully Hunter, and how such a tame movement became
427940	436540	the breaking point for the strain on the gaming community.
436540	441180	Everyone knows about the debates that arise from gamers, games, and so on, now as observed
441180	444580	I've noted that there has been a certain stigma raised around the gaming community,
444580	447920	particularly on the image created by a lot of its detractors when presenting the issues
447920	448920	such as harassment.
448920	451220	Let's discuss how this response has evolved over time.
451220	454780	One of the primary responses adopted by a lot of reactionaries was to immediately blame
454780	458300	the games they were playing, and I explained why this is a mostly false narrative in another
458300	461180	one of my videos, so I'm not going to touch on it too much now, but it should be quite
461180	464900	clear that from what I've presented that it's not games themselves that cause the dangerous
464900	465900	mentalities.
465900	470300	And yes, there are instances in which unhinged individuals carried out crimes mimicking video
470300	473100	games, but many of those individuals were shown to be rather delusional in their own
473100	475620	capacity without the assistance of video games.
475620	479340	However, this has not stopped them from nailing in the narrative, most recently in the light
479340	483660	of the Parkland shooting, although that legacy appears to be dying a very horrible death
483660	484700	very rapidly.
484700	488260	Many have suggested boycotting games that might include a high level of violence, harassment,
488260	491060	and other suggestive ideologies such as misogyny.
491060	495420	Famously, an Australian petition made Target remove GTA 5 from their shelves completely,
495420	498480	because many didn't like the way the game framed the treatment of women.
498480	502760	Now call me Nostradamus, but I expect the implications of such a move to be absolutely
502760	507320	zilched, in spite of its earnest intentions, however this was the case of a society that
507320	509900	didn't really completely grasp the nature of video games.
509900	513600	It always happens whenever something new and perhaps controversial is introduced, people
513600	517520	will jump in, convinced it will lead to the inevitable destruction of society as we know
517520	518520	it.
518520	521360	And as we have become more familiarised with this, there has been a shift away from this
521360	526280	responsibility on games, and many people generally understand that there is not much of a causal
526280	530280	relationship, though there are some people who like to push the blame whenever it's convenient
530280	531480	for their agenda.
531480	535120	So eventually people moved away from that, after all, most people project themselves
535120	539280	onto video games and not vice versa, the video game may activate the behaviour, but it was
539280	543040	still within the person, and yes sure there are some young kids who might be impressionable,
543040	546880	but I would make the argument that the responsibility lies on the parent to make sure that their
546880	549600	child behaves sensibly and not on the state.
549600	550600	So what now?
550600	555120	I said earlier we have two very separate concepts, politicisation of games and competition within
555120	557400	games, both of which cause great debate.
557400	560960	Gaming as an industry is primarily male, as I have said there are likely many explanations
560960	564960	for that, however given the recent drive for equal representation within industries it
564960	569080	has faced fierce criticism for its current make-up, however the campaign within the games
569080	572800	industry has seemed much more personal than many others, if you talk about the gender
572800	577120	pay gap in banking for example, you wouldn't talk about the regional managers, even other
577120	581340	media persuasions such as television and music have faced much less controversy in how they
581340	582920	handle such topics.
582920	583920	Why is this?
583920	587180	Because of the overlap that I have been talking about, whereas many industries such as TV
587180	591040	haven't been excessively criticised as a culture for the issues discussed today, the gaming
591040	595020	industry is often alleged to have this sort of bad aura about it, probably because it
595020	598060	doesn't have the same filter that other industries have on.
598060	602080	Gamers are much more integral to the games, you wouldn't have the viewers or the listeners
602080	606060	for example being the centrepiece in your content when we're talking about film or music.
606060	609800	Gamers on the other hand are very central, and they're not always politically correct,
609800	613360	and eventually many journalists in particular assumed the best way to combat this was to
613400	617180	actually try and project their agendas into the content, and that just didn't work, either
617180	621280	leading to the tiresome twitter threads mentioned earlier or just shouting loudly into an echo
621280	622280	chamber.
622280	626240	But mostly what this overlap between politicisation and casual gamers yielded was either backlash
626240	630400	or no reaction whatsoever, because although there may have been people participating in
630400	634040	the sort of alpha male projection that we can witness, it didn't reflect genuine beliefs
634040	637440	of any sort, and they are behaviours that many a person would inevitably grow out of
637440	638440	regardless.
638440	642160	You had the campaigns to deal with the in-game attitude and aggression, violence, etc, and
642160	644560	you had the out-of-game push for diversification.
644560	648360	Much of the out-of-game conflict was projected onto in-game assets, which as I expressed
648360	651240	earlier I believe to be the result of a very different cause.
651240	655200	However, no one wanted to nuance that sector, and it regularly became a pastime for many
655200	659360	journalists to go in on gamers with no real plan, as if complaining about them on a web
659360	661000	article would solve their problem.
661000	664840	This led to the creation of caricatures that firstly didn't represent many gamers, and
664840	668240	secondly didn't even reflect the nature of the political opposition that their own
668240	669440	agendas faced.
669440	672680	In the end, they just pissed people off who'd never heard of their arguments, and first
672680	675040	impressions are pretty fucking important.
675040	678520	When people get pissed, they didn't think to evaluate the arguments, which even if they
678520	682240	had some validity, were presented in the most sanctimonious way possible.
682240	684840	So, with all that in mind, what do they do?
684840	687920	There's clearly a rift that needs to be abridged.
687920	690820	Was it time for someone to grab the ball by the horns?
690820	694640	One day, someone was sitting down looking over their condominium and thinking, how do
694640	701180	I really take out all these horrible, racist, sexist gamers who constantly belittle my existence?
701180	704520	How do we make gaming a welcome environment for everyone?
704520	708480	Instead of going on Polygon and writing some argument lamenting the latest offensive trend
708480	711840	that will probably be irrelevant in a few months time, they thought, you know what?
711840	717400	We're gonna take the battle to them, and we're gonna make them stop being bullies.
717400	718400	We're gonna hunt them.
718400	733400	Bully Hunter has to be one of the worst ideas that has ever come to mind, and yet, only
733400	738400	in the twisted world that we reside in could it have A, ever happened, and B, ever faced
738400	739840	such a reaction.
739840	741300	But let's break that down.
741300	745280	Going after people who are being cunts in game on the surface does not sound like a
745280	746280	disastrous idea.
746280	750480	If I was to sit down with you and say, let's go after people being rude bellends and give
750480	753360	them what for, it would probably be a pretty lit time.
753360	757160	I want to say that Bully Hunter went one step further, but I think that would be underselling
757160	759180	how many steps further they went.
759180	763280	Let's just map this out, a serious organisation that stops people harassing by killing them
763280	764280	in game.
764280	768040	In the demonstration, you can hear the apprehension in the applause when the audience realised
768040	769520	what they had witnessed.
769520	771560	But why has this happened?
771560	775880	Well, as I said, it's kind of grown out of the intent to get the gamers.
775880	779440	Despite having really nothing to do with what a lot of these journalists claimed to
779440	783680	be concerned about, presented with the strawmans that had been constructed, they decided that
783680	787920	they were going to make gaming a safer space for everyone, and go after some bullies.
787920	793360	But gaming, and more importantly, bully hunting, didn't work how they envisioned it.
793360	794360	Let's break it down.
794360	797260	Firstly, when you experience the harassment, you can call on the Bully Hunter.
797260	802060	This raises immediate red flags, as it makes you question, well, what constitutes harassment,
802060	804800	How does the Bully Hunter know that a report is honest?
804800	807020	How is it not completely open to exploitation?
807020	810760	If someone has a grudge and wants to make a false report, can they just do that?
810760	812820	How can someone not impersonate a Bully Hunter?
812820	816420	Anyone can change their stream tag, it's not rocket science if the game's full.
816420	817740	Do they just wait to join?
817740	820140	What if the game finishes, and what if you leave the game?
820140	821140	Where do they go?
821140	824980	The stream didn't show the Bully Hunter gauging the situation before acting, just jumping
824980	825980	in and killing the person.
825980	830460	This also brings in the point that the person making the report can hold the Bully Hunter
830460	831460	to rating ransom.
831860	832860	What do I mean by this?
832860	836100	Well, if you can call in the Bully Hunter, you can subsequently rate them on their job
836100	837340	of eliminating the threat.
837340	840520	But in a competitive environment, this no longer becomes a question of how well they
840520	844300	do the job, rather how well they fulfill their client's desires.
844300	847520	Now to that, some might say, well, what's the problem with doing what the client wants?
847520	849420	In most occupations, I would agree.
849420	853060	But in this one, it directly involves dealing with someone else in an environment that makes
853060	854920	a person inherently biased.
854920	857600	So yes, a rating system is a terrible idea.
857600	860900	This would be a more prominent issue in itself if it wasn't overshadowed by an issue that
861340	862340	renders this borderline invalid.
862340	866740	The fact that the idea of the Bully Hunters dealing with the bullies is killing them in
866740	869820	game, and then leaving them with a disparaging message.
869820	870820	That is it.
870820	872740	Let's break down the numerous problems with this.
872740	876900	The idea that killing someone in game that focuses around killing people is rather insubstantial.
876900	880500	That would be like punishing someone in football by tackling them.
880500	881780	It's kind of the point already.
881780	885740	And yes, you could argue that it is more specifically targeted, which could irritate the player.
885740	890400	But in a game like CSGO, being killed is commonplace that it really wouldn't make the gamer reconsider
890400	892600	their position on in-game verbal abuse.
892600	896240	In fact, they were probably pissed off, it'd probably make them more pissed off, and thus
896240	897560	more abusive.
897560	901240	Often such abuse is compensated anyway, a lot of these kids trying to make up for the
901240	902840	fact that they're having a shit game.
902840	906200	A real gamer ain't gotta prove they're real as long as they know it.
906200	910320	So the virgins that you probably go after dying once more would have little to no effect
910320	914320	on their mentality, and if the gamer is actually accomplished, then surely the Bully Hunter
914320	916840	isn't invincible, surely they can die too.
916840	920440	This is actually empirically supported by studies that state men who are having a bad
920440	922400	game are more likely to act aggressively.
922400	926040	I don't know about you lads and lasses, but if I've had a bad game, it's much more
926040	929040	probable for me to come off a bit livid.
929040	946080	Also, the message that the Bully Hunter leaves refers exactly to the reason that they have
946080	950300	been hunted, and now they know they've upset someone to the point of calling in other people
950300	951300	to save them.
951300	953560	They're just going harder and harder and harder.
953560	958320	The Bully Hunters did a livestream where everything went surprisingly, well, suspiciously smooth,
958320	961400	and although it's not something that they could immediately prove as fake, the bullies
961400	963720	seemed extremely cliche to say the least.
963720	967280	Now the point in cliches is that they do exist, but on top of that, the fact that they had
967280	972000	absolutely no problems with such an observably flawed concept made it highly questionable,
972000	975740	and many Counter-Strike gamers, especially experienced ones, call it fake.
975740	979980	Now in response, one of the livestream hosts, Zombie Unicorn, said that she flooded a line
979980	981580	emphasising it was fake.
981580	982580	That is bullshit.
982580	986700	And alright, you can't do anything outside the realms of what the game allows you to
986700	987700	do.
987700	988700	What else can they do?
988700	991340	This is a fair question, but just because you can't answer it immediately doesn't
991340	994060	mean that any compromise is necessarily worth investing in.
994060	997140	As speaking of investors, let's talk about how that's turning out, shall we?
997140	1000220	I remember when I saw a pair of headphones being advertised in my feed and I thought
1000220	1002680	to myself, how will wearing headphones end bullying?
1002680	1006720	This was before the Bully Hunters controversy transpired, so I was genuinely clueless of
1006720	1007940	what the point was.
1007940	1011640	Now I have some clarity with regards to it, it makes the situation even more laughable.
1011640	1015840	Upon the tidal wave of criticism approaching them, the Prime sponsors who made the headphones
1015840	1020760	steal series completely withdrew their support and published a remorseful Facebook post reflecting
1020760	1021760	their involvement.
1021760	1026080	They, like myself, touch on some important discussion, and that will transition us into
1026080	1027280	our next points.
1027280	1031720	Why did it receive such attention for a project that in theory seems so modest?
1031760	1033760	Because it was a crossover.
1033760	1038640	The pinnacle crossover between out of game activism and in game realism, most gamers
1038640	1042140	just want a game, most gamers do not give a shit about this and do not want to give
1042140	1043140	a shit about this.
1043140	1047260	Now certain individuals have often been criticised for misrepresenting the game sphere, however
1047260	1050800	if you're one of those people who has done that, you're somewhat safe in the ivory
1050800	1054800	tower you have constructed for yourself, because to bitch about gamers is so broad that you
1054800	1057480	can say a lot without being called out.
1057480	1061480	However as soon as you go in game, the ivory tower comes tumbling down.
1061480	1065080	And their naivety to these gaming environments is desperately exposed.
1065080	1069360	Most importantly, it finally brought that in game and out of game backlash together.
1069360	1073200	Everyone from PewDiePie to the Chicago Tribune were commenting on it, and the flaws were
1073200	1074880	out in the open to scrutinise.
1074880	1079120	I highly doubt that they will have the humility to take anything away from this, but maybe
1079120	1083200	this will bring some insight to the actual in game truths rather than the expectations
1083200	1085380	implanted from an outsider's point of view.
1085380	1089280	This instant does cater to the narrative that many people who write these articles have
1089280	1093540	very little exposure to the actual environment, or seem to exaggerate the victimhood that
1093540	1094540	does occur.
1094540	1098380	If I wanted to go and shoot some people in game who were being cunts, it would be fine
1098380	1103060	for some short term amusement, but it would be for my amusement, and I would totally anticipate
1103060	1105120	being barraged by hate due to it.
1105120	1108920	On top of that, if I said to them, I'll stop killing you if you stop being rude, I
1108920	1112160	think the reply I received may include a few expletives.
1112160	1116600	Harassment is shit, but some people go into these games looking to be the antithesis of
1116600	1117600	victims.
1117600	1120840	If you tell these virgins exactly where they can shove it, there's a difference that
1120840	1125940	you cannot really apprehend how to deal with something so abstract as in game aggression.
1125940	1130400	The whole situation inevitably leaves the gaming world in a weird place, and maybe,
1130400	1135160	maybe for a brief moment, people will be able to see the reality over the lampoons.
1135160	1138880	People want to do these campaigns with more power to them, but understand the relativity
1138880	1143320	of it, and stop attacking or mischaracterising people who have very little interest in your
1143320	1146020	agenda, because it just opposes them to you.
1146020	1149860	And if you want people to hear you out, you have to separate them from your already existing
1149860	1151500	critics, and appeal to them.
1151500	1155300	They may not agree, but at least they wouldn't be alienated, and you wouldn't be embarrassed
1155300	1159140	when you tried to create depictions of how they actually behave.
1159140	1162060	Chances are that the people in the wrong, well, if you believe they're in the wrong
1162060	1166220	that is, will go back to mudslinging in the columns, and then questioning why people aren't
1166220	1167220	at war with them.
1167220	1170140	It's clear that that's a cycle that they're much more comfortable with.
1170140	1173540	What has occurred is people identifying the problem, but not really asking themselves
1173540	1177620	how and why, then conflating their agenda, and then pointing fingers at people that really
1177620	1181180	have much less to do with it than they think they do, and eventually creating something
1181180	1184060	that completely exposes that flawed line of thinking.
1184060	1187220	As I've noted, there are many reasons that such an environment can arise.
1187220	1191300	The in-game goals, the competitiveness, the person themselves, but that is an inherently
1191300	1195180	natural outcome from the society that we live in today, and you really have to look much
1195180	1199460	beyond the mentality of video games, and more towards social causes, if you ever wanted
1199460	1200900	to change and address that.
1200940	1204620	And make no mistake, you may not be able to change that, and even if you can, it would
1204620	1210260	be an incredibly challenging task, but that doesn't mean you settle for really bad compromises,
1210260	1213700	and I don't mean like going for second best, because there may be some other options that
1213700	1218540	could work, but this option clearly doesn't, and it just rubs everyone the wrong way.
1218540	1222620	So maybe it's just time to change the narrative, and change the tone that you're taking when
1222620	1225860	dealing with these issues that you know exist.
1225860	1227820	You're not perfect either, just saying.
1227820	1230660	Either way, I would love to hear what you think of this topic.
1230660	1234740	Let me know down below in the little lovely bloody comment section, and a massive thanks
1234740	1237940	to the editors who have made this magic happen once again.
1237940	1241420	Keep up the great work blokes, and thank you so much for all your support of recent, it's
1241420	1244300	been really special, and I'm glad to be back.
1244300	1245580	Makes me feel welcome.
1245580	1248940	So let me know what you think, I'm always open to discussion, I'd love to hear your
1248940	1249940	point of view.
1249940	1253580	However, until then, I'm The Right Opinion, and I'll see you in the next one.
1260660	1263140	Bye.
