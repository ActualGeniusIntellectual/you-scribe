00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,360
Hello ladies and gentlemen and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with

2
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:09,880
too much free time.

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:13,640
What is inherently wrong with going after bullies in game and giving them what's what?

4
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:17,160
Well today we're going to investigate that and work out how such an organisation like

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,140
Bully Hunters has arisen and how it's subsequently been lambasted by everyone.

6
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:25,520
But before we get any further, to those who are out of the loop, what are Bully Hunters?

7
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:28,480
Well the Bully Hunter campaign was set up in the light of harassment, basically what

8
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,160
the method is, when you're in game and you're experiencing some twat for example, there's

9
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,840
some spotty kid going to tell you to go in the kitchen and make a fucking sandwich, you

10
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,160
go on the website and you go and call that Bully Hunter, that Bully Hunter links up with

11
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:42,320
your steam so they can join your game and they deal with that fucking bully, they'll

12
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,640
kill that fucking bully in game and leave them with a message saying that harassment

13
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:49,600
will not be tolerated, capiche, the problem is no more.

14
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,340
But why would there be a necessity for something like this in gamer culture?

15
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,080
Why would we ever need that?

16
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:58,280
Well maybe to understand that we have to go back in time a bit.

17
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:02,660
So let's hop in the time machine and get some context, today we're going into real

18
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:03,660
gamer hours.

19
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:15,040
One of the most infamous associations with gamer culture, and something that was clearly

20
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,860
rooted in the Bully Hunter campaign, is gamers and their supposed hostility, most notably

21
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:20,860
to females.

22
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:24,800
Now this is clearly rooted in some observable evidence, however a lot of people just observe

23
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:28,720
this and point at it and say, it's a problem, rather than asking the deeper questions for

24
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,000
why it has arisen.

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,560
We should firstly question the nature that would create such an environment, where it's

26
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,960
not too hard to understand how such a situation can arise.

27
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,440
So let us list out a catalogue of prerequisites to fulfil.

28
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:44,520
Firstly online gaming is competitive, there's an inherently important point to note.

29
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,920
It's empirically proven that often when people compete against each other, they may not be

30
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,300
the friendliest, especially when they feel that there is something to game, whether it's

31
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,920
a reward or mere status.

32
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,280
That is a primary condition for such an environment.

33
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,000
Other gamers will apply many mental tactics to try and gain advantage over their opponent,

34
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,720
especially when they're losing, which is why trash talk is much more likely to occur between

35
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:06,520
teams rather than within teams, that's not to say it doesn't happen, but that's an important

36
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,520
first point.

37
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,000
The next point to make is that it's a lot easier to intimidate over the medium of a

38
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
video game.

39
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,640
Your name is protected by an alias, and your identity is pretty much completely veiled.

40
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:19,360
You do not know the people who you're interacting with, unless you're in a friends group of

41
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,980
whom I assume you wouldn't bully.

42
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:24,340
Whatever you say in these places will almost certainly not come back to you.

43
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:27,940
Basically what that means is that when this culture is created, it can spread very quickly

44
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:31,340
under the premise of anonymity, then we need to observe the demographics.

45
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:33,980
Bully Under was promoted on Counter Strike Global Offensive.

46
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:35,400
This is no coincidence.

47
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,020
There is a largely male fanbase for many shooter games in particular, now there can be many

48
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:42,740
hypotheses for why that is, but currently it is what it is.

49
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:47,280
Then we infuse the fact that gamers on average are not generally as mature as the typical

50
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,620
law abiding citizens.

51
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:51,540
There is nothing intrinsically wrong with being slightly immature, I'd argue that

52
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:55,300
I'm very juvenile from time to time, but you put all these together, and yes you're

53
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,980
going to have some sort of outcome which may result in the verbal degradation of others

54
00:02:58,980 --> 00:02:59,980
around you.

55
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:03,260
I don't think that's on gaming itself, I think that's on the very particular aesthetics

56
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:07,500
that culminate around such an environment, which is magnified particularly in this scenario.

57
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,660
So I don't believe the idea that certain things such as misogyny existing on a proportionally

58
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:15,460
greater scale within such games is an unfounded one, but I do believe that it is something

59
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:19,180
in need of more elaboration, and it should also be put into perspective.

60
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:23,180
Human beings don't tend to go on to games with an agenda, and I think that's an important

61
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:27,580
point, a very high majority of people do not go into games with the intention of abusing

62
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:31,260
people or spreading toxic ideas, particularly the latter, you're not going to be using

63
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:35,380
Counter Strike Global Offensive to recruit for your chauvinist cult to say the least.

64
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:37,380
I'm not trying to give anyone any ideas.

65
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:42,300
So then we have to question what is the ideological system behind these games, being the MVP,

66
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:46,860
being the victors, being the best, shooters in particular are very domination oriented,

67
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:50,340
many want to assert themselves as in charge, and therefore this will lead to them taking

68
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:54,260
up a character of what they perceive to be the most successful in-game persona, this

69
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,220
is obviously the alpha male.

70
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:59,260
However given the fact that many of these people's understanding of what it takes

71
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:03,480
to be an alpha male is somewhat two dimensional, it'll often lead to quote abuse tactics

72
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:08,160
in a direct attempt to subjugate their opposites, which is why although misogyny may be observed

73
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:13,000
as more precedent, it would not surprise me if abuse in general was higher across the

74
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,960
board, particularly male on male, and even female on male, if I were to take a guess

75
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:21,320
most abuse would revolve around players calling each other virgins, going after their libido,

76
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,920
presenting them as effeminate and unsuccessful.

77
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:27,240
However one of the greatest mistakes in my opinion is then assuming that the game is

78
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:31,400
the sole cause of the behaviour, this is also an important point and there is a lot of important

79
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:35,000
points that you need to put together in your head today because we are putting the pieces

80
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,400
of a puzzle together.

81
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,480
Just because something may create an environment where it can happen, doesn't mean it will

82
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:43,420
happen, now for all you lads coming down to education corner with me the right opinion,

83
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:47,560
this is something known as retrospective determinism, don't pull this out of your ass all the

84
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:51,480
time but it's a fun little fact and little word nugget to make you feel a bit smarter.

85
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:54,880
If abuse is higher proportionally, it's hard to say that it's something specifically

86
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:59,320
pertaining to gender, and moreover a Darwinistic drive for dominance within a game that implicitly

87
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,920
promotes hierarchy.

88
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:04,000
However it wouldn't be right to talk about this without talking about the other topics

89
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,640
that are often conflated, which I personally believe to be a very different matter but

90
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:13,580
due to the correlation a causal link is often drawn, which is obviously, out of game, politics.

91
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:17,240
Now video games are at a very unique position within their market, they're not centralised

92
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:20,760
in the sort of Hollywood bubble and therefore haven't been dominated by a lot of progressive

93
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:25,220
politics associated with that, however journalism in particular seems very driven to subscribe

94
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:29,800
to those ideas, nonetheless this has not come without its resistance and many seem very

95
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,300
defiant to preserve certain aspects of game.

96
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:36,780
Now to speak about politics, you have to speak about gamergate, a scandal which pitted these

97
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:39,120
two very distinct sects against each other.

98
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,440
Now I do not wish to speak too much about it specifically because I was not there and

99
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:46,880
it appears to be a situation which is really fucking hard to find an unbiased testimony,

100
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,680
with all that in mind I still see people talking about the topic today, with many advocates

101
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:54,760
still romanticising over it in an attempt to present themselves as martyrs.

102
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:58,340
There has often been a lot of retrospective reframing of what has happened and people

103
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:02,260
attempting to construct a podium out of it to launch their careers, I'm not gonna name

104
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:05,340
any names but it's pretty fucking obvious.

105
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:09,380
Anyhow this has led to the constantly renewing debate of sexism within the games industry,

106
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:13,180
but what this seems to forget is that many gamers that I've exemplified earlier in this

107
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:17,360
video are not remotely political, they're just juvenile, some of which I'm sure have

108
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,940
never even heard of gamergate, back in 2013 the only way I had heard of gamergate was

109
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:25,860
through the Angry Joe show, I genuinely didn't know what he was talking about, so all this

110
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:29,380
basically leads to back and forth between Twitter pseudo intellectuals on stuff that

111
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:33,620
is really rather ineffectual to many people who do not use these websites, and believe

112
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:37,340
me, there are many places where sites like Twitter are not overwhelmingly popular, where

113
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:41,140
I'm from in particular, we're almost all resident on Facebook, and I'm the exception.

114
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:44,840
But while this is all transpiring, these sorts of people, the journalists, are all looking

115
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:49,780
for a way to combat what they see as the rampant aggression within games, but by kinda responding

116
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:54,020
to something that is actually quite psychologically rooted and treating it with the heavy hand

117
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:58,060
of politicisation, this can lead to many ham-fisted attempts to try and prevent toxic

118
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:02,360
mentalities, and I think it's necessary to discuss how it's escalated to that point,

119
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:07,940
and then we will get to the magnum opus, Bully Hunter, and how such a tame movement became

120
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:16,540
the breaking point for the strain on the gaming community.

121
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:21,180
Everyone knows about the debates that arise from gamers, games, and so on, now as observed

122
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:24,580
I've noted that there has been a certain stigma raised around the gaming community,

123
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:27,920
particularly on the image created by a lot of its detractors when presenting the issues

124
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,920
such as harassment.

125
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,220
Let's discuss how this response has evolved over time.

126
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:34,780
One of the primary responses adopted by a lot of reactionaries was to immediately blame

127
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:38,300
the games they were playing, and I explained why this is a mostly false narrative in another

128
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:41,180
one of my videos, so I'm not going to touch on it too much now, but it should be quite

129
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:44,900
clear that from what I've presented that it's not games themselves that cause the dangerous

130
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:45,900
mentalities.

131
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:50,300
And yes, there are instances in which unhinged individuals carried out crimes mimicking video

132
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:53,100
games, but many of those individuals were shown to be rather delusional in their own

133
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,620
capacity without the assistance of video games.

134
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:59,340
However, this has not stopped them from nailing in the narrative, most recently in the light

135
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:03,660
of the Parkland shooting, although that legacy appears to be dying a very horrible death

136
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:04,700
very rapidly.

137
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:08,260
Many have suggested boycotting games that might include a high level of violence, harassment,

138
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:11,060
and other suggestive ideologies such as misogyny.

139
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:15,420
Famously, an Australian petition made Target remove GTA 5 from their shelves completely,

140
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:18,480
because many didn't like the way the game framed the treatment of women.

141
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:22,760
Now call me Nostradamus, but I expect the implications of such a move to be absolutely

142
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:27,320
zilched, in spite of its earnest intentions, however this was the case of a society that

143
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,900
didn't really completely grasp the nature of video games.

144
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:33,600
It always happens whenever something new and perhaps controversial is introduced, people

145
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:37,520
will jump in, convinced it will lead to the inevitable destruction of society as we know

146
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,520
it.

147
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:41,360
And as we have become more familiarised with this, there has been a shift away from this

148
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:46,280
responsibility on games, and many people generally understand that there is not much of a causal

149
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:50,280
relationship, though there are some people who like to push the blame whenever it's convenient

150
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,480
for their agenda.

151
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:55,120
So eventually people moved away from that, after all, most people project themselves

152
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,280
onto video games and not vice versa, the video game may activate the behaviour, but it was

153
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:03,040
still within the person, and yes sure there are some young kids who might be impressionable,

154
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,880
but I would make the argument that the responsibility lies on the parent to make sure that their

155
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,600
child behaves sensibly and not on the state.

156
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,600
So what now?

157
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:15,120
I said earlier we have two very separate concepts, politicisation of games and competition within

158
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,400
games, both of which cause great debate.

159
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,960
Gaming as an industry is primarily male, as I have said there are likely many explanations

160
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:24,960
for that, however given the recent drive for equal representation within industries it

161
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:29,080
has faced fierce criticism for its current make-up, however the campaign within the games

162
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:32,800
industry has seemed much more personal than many others, if you talk about the gender

163
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:37,120
pay gap in banking for example, you wouldn't talk about the regional managers, even other

164
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,340
media persuasions such as television and music have faced much less controversy in how they

165
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:42,920
handle such topics.

166
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:43,920
Why is this?

167
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,180
Because of the overlap that I have been talking about, whereas many industries such as TV

168
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:51,040
haven't been excessively criticised as a culture for the issues discussed today, the gaming

169
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:55,020
industry is often alleged to have this sort of bad aura about it, probably because it

170
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:58,060
doesn't have the same filter that other industries have on.

171
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:02,080
Gamers are much more integral to the games, you wouldn't have the viewers or the listeners

172
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:06,060
for example being the centrepiece in your content when we're talking about film or music.

173
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:09,800
Gamers on the other hand are very central, and they're not always politically correct,

174
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:13,360
and eventually many journalists in particular assumed the best way to combat this was to

175
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:17,180
actually try and project their agendas into the content, and that just didn't work, either

176
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:21,280
leading to the tiresome twitter threads mentioned earlier or just shouting loudly into an echo

177
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,280
chamber.

178
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:26,240
But mostly what this overlap between politicisation and casual gamers yielded was either backlash

179
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,400
or no reaction whatsoever, because although there may have been people participating in

180
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:34,040
the sort of alpha male projection that we can witness, it didn't reflect genuine beliefs

181
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:37,440
of any sort, and they are behaviours that many a person would inevitably grow out of

182
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,440
regardless.

183
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:42,160
You had the campaigns to deal with the in-game attitude and aggression, violence, etc, and

184
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,560
you had the out-of-game push for diversification.

185
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,360
Much of the out-of-game conflict was projected onto in-game assets, which as I expressed

186
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:51,240
earlier I believe to be the result of a very different cause.

187
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:55,200
However, no one wanted to nuance that sector, and it regularly became a pastime for many

188
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,360
journalists to go in on gamers with no real plan, as if complaining about them on a web

189
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,000
article would solve their problem.

190
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,840
This led to the creation of caricatures that firstly didn't represent many gamers, and

191
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:08,240
secondly didn't even reflect the nature of the political opposition that their own

192
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,440
agendas faced.

193
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,680
In the end, they just pissed people off who'd never heard of their arguments, and first

194
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:15,040
impressions are pretty fucking important.

195
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,520
When people get pissed, they didn't think to evaluate the arguments, which even if they

196
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:22,240
had some validity, were presented in the most sanctimonious way possible.

197
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,840
So, with all that in mind, what do they do?

198
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,920
There's clearly a rift that needs to be abridged.

199
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,820
Was it time for someone to grab the ball by the horns?

200
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:34,640
One day, someone was sitting down looking over their condominium and thinking, how do

201
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:41,180
I really take out all these horrible, racist, sexist gamers who constantly belittle my existence?

202
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:44,520
How do we make gaming a welcome environment for everyone?

203
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:48,480
Instead of going on Polygon and writing some argument lamenting the latest offensive trend

204
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,840
that will probably be irrelevant in a few months time, they thought, you know what?

205
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:57,400
We're gonna take the battle to them, and we're gonna make them stop being bullies.

206
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,400
We're gonna hunt them.

207
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:13,400
Bully Hunter has to be one of the worst ideas that has ever come to mind, and yet, only

208
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:18,400
in the twisted world that we reside in could it have A, ever happened, and B, ever faced

209
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,840
such a reaction.

210
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,300
But let's break that down.

211
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:25,280
Going after people who are being cunts in game on the surface does not sound like a

212
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,280
disastrous idea.

213
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:30,480
If I was to sit down with you and say, let's go after people being rude bellends and give

214
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,360
them what for, it would probably be a pretty lit time.

215
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,160
I want to say that Bully Hunter went one step further, but I think that would be underselling

216
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,180
how many steps further they went.

217
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:43,280
Let's just map this out, a serious organisation that stops people harassing by killing them

218
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,280
in game.

219
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:48,040
In the demonstration, you can hear the apprehension in the applause when the audience realised

220
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,520
what they had witnessed.

221
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,560
But why has this happened?

222
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:55,880
Well, as I said, it's kind of grown out of the intent to get the gamers.

223
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:59,440
Despite having really nothing to do with what a lot of these journalists claimed to

224
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,680
be concerned about, presented with the strawmans that had been constructed, they decided that

225
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:07,920
they were going to make gaming a safer space for everyone, and go after some bullies.

226
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:13,360
But gaming, and more importantly, bully hunting, didn't work how they envisioned it.

227
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,360
Let's break it down.

228
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,260
Firstly, when you experience the harassment, you can call on the Bully Hunter.

229
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:22,060
This raises immediate red flags, as it makes you question, well, what constitutes harassment,

230
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:24,800
How does the Bully Hunter know that a report is honest?

231
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,020
How is it not completely open to exploitation?

232
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:30,760
If someone has a grudge and wants to make a false report, can they just do that?

233
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,820
How can someone not impersonate a Bully Hunter?

234
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:36,420
Anyone can change their stream tag, it's not rocket science if the game's full.

235
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:37,740
Do they just wait to join?

236
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:40,140
What if the game finishes, and what if you leave the game?

237
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:41,140
Where do they go?

238
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:44,980
The stream didn't show the Bully Hunter gauging the situation before acting, just jumping

239
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:45,980
in and killing the person.

240
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:50,460
This also brings in the point that the person making the report can hold the Bully Hunter

241
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:51,460
to rating ransom.

242
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:52,860
What do I mean by this?

243
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:56,100
Well, if you can call in the Bully Hunter, you can subsequently rate them on their job

244
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,340
of eliminating the threat.

245
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:00,520
But in a competitive environment, this no longer becomes a question of how well they

246
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:04,300
do the job, rather how well they fulfill their client's desires.

247
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:07,520
Now to that, some might say, well, what's the problem with doing what the client wants?

248
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,420
In most occupations, I would agree.

249
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:13,060
But in this one, it directly involves dealing with someone else in an environment that makes

250
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,920
a person inherently biased.

251
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,600
So yes, a rating system is a terrible idea.

252
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,900
This would be a more prominent issue in itself if it wasn't overshadowed by an issue that

253
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:22,340
renders this borderline invalid.

254
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:26,740
The fact that the idea of the Bully Hunters dealing with the bullies is killing them in

255
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:29,820
game, and then leaving them with a disparaging message.

256
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:30,820
That is it.

257
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,740
Let's break down the numerous problems with this.

258
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:36,900
The idea that killing someone in game that focuses around killing people is rather insubstantial.

259
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:40,500
That would be like punishing someone in football by tackling them.

260
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,780
It's kind of the point already.

261
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:45,740
And yes, you could argue that it is more specifically targeted, which could irritate the player.

262
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:50,400
But in a game like CSGO, being killed is commonplace that it really wouldn't make the gamer reconsider

263
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,600
their position on in-game verbal abuse.

264
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:56,240
In fact, they were probably pissed off, it'd probably make them more pissed off, and thus

265
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,560
more abusive.

266
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:01,240
Often such abuse is compensated anyway, a lot of these kids trying to make up for the

267
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,840
fact that they're having a shit game.

268
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:06,200
A real gamer ain't gotta prove they're real as long as they know it.

269
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:10,320
So the virgins that you probably go after dying once more would have little to no effect

270
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,320
on their mentality, and if the gamer is actually accomplished, then surely the Bully Hunter

271
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,840
isn't invincible, surely they can die too.

272
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:20,440
This is actually empirically supported by studies that state men who are having a bad

273
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,400
game are more likely to act aggressively.

274
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:26,040
I don't know about you lads and lasses, but if I've had a bad game, it's much more

275
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:29,040
probable for me to come off a bit livid.

276
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:46,080
Also, the message that the Bully Hunter leaves refers exactly to the reason that they have

277
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:50,300
been hunted, and now they know they've upset someone to the point of calling in other people

278
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,300
to save them.

279
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,560
They're just going harder and harder and harder.

280
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:58,320
The Bully Hunters did a livestream where everything went surprisingly, well, suspiciously smooth,

281
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,400
and although it's not something that they could immediately prove as fake, the bullies

282
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,720
seemed extremely cliche to say the least.

283
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:07,280
Now the point in cliches is that they do exist, but on top of that, the fact that they had

284
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:12,000
absolutely no problems with such an observably flawed concept made it highly questionable,

285
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,740
and many Counter-Strike gamers, especially experienced ones, call it fake.

286
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:19,980
Now in response, one of the livestream hosts, Zombie Unicorn, said that she flooded a line

287
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,580
emphasising it was fake.

288
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:22,580
That is bullshit.

289
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:26,700
And alright, you can't do anything outside the realms of what the game allows you to

290
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:27,700
do.

291
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:28,700
What else can they do?

292
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:31,340
This is a fair question, but just because you can't answer it immediately doesn't

293
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:34,060
mean that any compromise is necessarily worth investing in.

294
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:37,140
As speaking of investors, let's talk about how that's turning out, shall we?

295
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:40,220
I remember when I saw a pair of headphones being advertised in my feed and I thought

296
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:42,680
to myself, how will wearing headphones end bullying?

297
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:46,720
This was before the Bully Hunters controversy transpired, so I was genuinely clueless of

298
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,940
what the point was.

299
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:51,640
Now I have some clarity with regards to it, it makes the situation even more laughable.

300
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:55,840
Upon the tidal wave of criticism approaching them, the Prime sponsors who made the headphones

301
00:16:55,840 --> 00:17:00,760
steal series completely withdrew their support and published a remorseful Facebook post reflecting

302
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:01,760
their involvement.

303
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:06,080
They, like myself, touch on some important discussion, and that will transition us into

304
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,280
our next points.

305
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:11,720
Why did it receive such attention for a project that in theory seems so modest?

306
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,760
Because it was a crossover.

307
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:18,640
The pinnacle crossover between out of game activism and in game realism, most gamers

308
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,140
just want a game, most gamers do not give a shit about this and do not want to give

309
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,140
a shit about this.

310
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:27,260
Now certain individuals have often been criticised for misrepresenting the game sphere, however

311
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:30,800
if you're one of those people who has done that, you're somewhat safe in the ivory

312
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:34,800
tower you have constructed for yourself, because to bitch about gamers is so broad that you

313
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,480
can say a lot without being called out.

314
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:41,480
However as soon as you go in game, the ivory tower comes tumbling down.

315
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:45,080
And their naivety to these gaming environments is desperately exposed.

316
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:49,360
Most importantly, it finally brought that in game and out of game backlash together.

317
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:53,200
Everyone from PewDiePie to the Chicago Tribune were commenting on it, and the flaws were

318
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,880
out in the open to scrutinise.

319
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:59,120
I highly doubt that they will have the humility to take anything away from this, but maybe

320
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:03,200
this will bring some insight to the actual in game truths rather than the expectations

321
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,380
implanted from an outsider's point of view.

322
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:09,280
This instant does cater to the narrative that many people who write these articles have

323
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:13,540
very little exposure to the actual environment, or seem to exaggerate the victimhood that

324
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:14,540
does occur.

325
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:18,380
If I wanted to go and shoot some people in game who were being cunts, it would be fine

326
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:23,060
for some short term amusement, but it would be for my amusement, and I would totally anticipate

327
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,120
being barraged by hate due to it.

328
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,920
On top of that, if I said to them, I'll stop killing you if you stop being rude, I

329
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:32,160
think the reply I received may include a few expletives.

330
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:36,600
Harassment is shit, but some people go into these games looking to be the antithesis of

331
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,600
victims.

332
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,840
If you tell these virgins exactly where they can shove it, there's a difference that

333
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:45,940
you cannot really apprehend how to deal with something so abstract as in game aggression.

334
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:50,400
The whole situation inevitably leaves the gaming world in a weird place, and maybe,

335
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:55,160
maybe for a brief moment, people will be able to see the reality over the lampoons.

336
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:58,880
People want to do these campaigns with more power to them, but understand the relativity

337
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:03,320
of it, and stop attacking or mischaracterising people who have very little interest in your

338
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:06,020
agenda, because it just opposes them to you.

339
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:09,860
And if you want people to hear you out, you have to separate them from your already existing

340
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:11,500
critics, and appeal to them.

341
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:15,300
They may not agree, but at least they wouldn't be alienated, and you wouldn't be embarrassed

342
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:19,140
when you tried to create depictions of how they actually behave.

343
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:22,060
Chances are that the people in the wrong, well, if you believe they're in the wrong

344
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:26,220
that is, will go back to mudslinging in the columns, and then questioning why people aren't

345
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:27,220
at war with them.

346
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:30,140
It's clear that that's a cycle that they're much more comfortable with.

347
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:33,540
What has occurred is people identifying the problem, but not really asking themselves

348
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:37,620
how and why, then conflating their agenda, and then pointing fingers at people that really

349
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:41,180
have much less to do with it than they think they do, and eventually creating something

350
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:44,060
that completely exposes that flawed line of thinking.

351
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:47,220
As I've noted, there are many reasons that such an environment can arise.

352
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:51,300
The in-game goals, the competitiveness, the person themselves, but that is an inherently

353
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:55,180
natural outcome from the society that we live in today, and you really have to look much

354
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:59,460
beyond the mentality of video games, and more towards social causes, if you ever wanted

355
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,900
to change and address that.

356
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:04,620
And make no mistake, you may not be able to change that, and even if you can, it would

357
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:10,260
be an incredibly challenging task, but that doesn't mean you settle for really bad compromises,

358
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:13,700
and I don't mean like going for second best, because there may be some other options that

359
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:18,540
could work, but this option clearly doesn't, and it just rubs everyone the wrong way.

360
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:22,620
So maybe it's just time to change the narrative, and change the tone that you're taking when

361
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:25,860
dealing with these issues that you know exist.

362
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,820
You're not perfect either, just saying.

363
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:30,660
Either way, I would love to hear what you think of this topic.

364
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:34,740
Let me know down below in the little lovely bloody comment section, and a massive thanks

365
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:37,940
to the editors who have made this magic happen once again.

366
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:41,420
Keep up the great work blokes, and thank you so much for all your support of recent, it's

367
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:44,300
been really special, and I'm glad to be back.

368
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,580
Makes me feel welcome.

369
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:48,940
So let me know what you think, I'm always open to discussion, I'd love to hear your

370
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:49,940
point of view.

371
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:53,580
However, until then, I'm The Right Opinion, and I'll see you in the next one.

372
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:03,140
Bye.
