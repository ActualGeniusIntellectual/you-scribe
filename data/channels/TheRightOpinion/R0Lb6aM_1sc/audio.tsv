0	2640	David Cameron has thrown himself in the deep end.
2640	5960	The deep, deep, deep end.
5960	15960	Hello and welcome to the Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time.
15960	18960	And today we talk about Dave.
18960	20960	And a few of his friends.
20960	25960	Now, my opinion of David Cameron has followed suit with public opinion of David Cameron,
25960	29960	slowly deteriorating over the course of the last six months.
29960	31960	He's not done great, needless to say.
31960	35960	A few bad budgets, a few broken promises.
35960	37960	It has been clumsy to mention the least.
37960	42960	And then there were the Panama Papers, revealing what most people already knew.
42960	47960	That a lot of high profile individuals were hiding money in offshore bank accounts.
47960	48960	Oh joy.
48960	53960	One of the names disclosed was Cameron's late father, Ian Donald Cameron.
53960	59960	He had been a client and had ran an offshore fund that avoided tax for a grand total of 30 years.
59960	66960	Dave had a few shares in this fund, which he benefited from and sold shortly before he came Prime Minister.
66960	71960	I'm going to make one thing clear, I'm not going to judge his role in it until I find out more information.
71960	76960	As I don't believe a person should be held responsible for their father's actions.
76960	82960	What I am going to judge is the response from these moral crusaders that we call politicians.
82960	86960	So first, let's talk about the cam man himself.
86960	95960	In reaction, very soon after his father was implicated, David Cameron insisted it was a private matter, a family matter, that needed respect.
95960	101960	The following day, the matter was no longer a private matter, as he originally implied.
101960	104960	And all they needed to know is that he didn't benefit from them.
104960	109960	Then, a day later, he won't be benefiting from them in the future.
109960	111960	I could go on.
111960	116960	Public trust for politicians has once again been shredded more than a minister's tax return document.
126960	136960	Now because they're not completely devoid of any sensitivity, they're not these robots that just don't understand us, though pretty close.
136960	139960	So they clearly noticed that we were losing faith.
139960	147960	So in that to restore this faith that had been lost, the ministers nobly released their tax details. True heroes they are.
147960	151960	So these tax returns are completely squeaky clean.
151960	155960	Obviously because they cover the income they actually claim to have.
155960	158960	Once again, political gesturing.
159960	169960	Though it would be curious to note that our good friend George Osborne claimed that we didn't need to see his previous tax year's returns because they weren't interesting.
169960	173960	Bullshit. You're talking bullshit.
173960	177960	Jeremy Corbyn filed his tax return a week late.
177960	179960	The mad rebel he is.
179960	181960	Don't fight with Jeremy Corbyn.
181960	187960	Though on the bright side, he doesn't have a taxpayer funded 53k a year fashion advisor like some do.
188960	189960	Cameron.
189960	192960	Though you wouldn't be able to tell.
192960	195960	So what did we learn from the Panama Papers?
195960	199960	Well that the worst part of tax avoidance is being caught.
199960	202960	Politicians have trouble telling the truth.
202960	206960	And that British people already knew the facts that I just stated.
206960	209960	Basically you can't trust them.
209960	211960	That was my opinion.
212960	216960	And I guess that was my outline on the Panama Papers and what can be drawn from it.
216960	219960	As I say, you know, it's still quite a new development.
219960	224960	Can't judge too much but hopefully it's not the last we'll hear about these antics.
224960	228960	So I'm the right opinion and I bid you farewell.
