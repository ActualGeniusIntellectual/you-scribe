00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,640
David Cameron has thrown himself in the deep end.

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:05,960
The deep, deep, deep end.

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:15,960
Hello and welcome to the Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time.

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,960
And today we talk about Dave.

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,960
And a few of his friends.

6
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,960
Now, my opinion of David Cameron has followed suit with public opinion of David Cameron,

7
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:29,960
slowly deteriorating over the course of the last six months.

8
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,960
He's not done great, needless to say.

9
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:35,960
A few bad budgets, a few broken promises.

10
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,960
It has been clumsy to mention the least.

11
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:42,960
And then there were the Panama Papers, revealing what most people already knew.

12
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,960
That a lot of high profile individuals were hiding money in offshore bank accounts.

13
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:48,960
Oh joy.

14
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,960
One of the names disclosed was Cameron's late father, Ian Donald Cameron.

15
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:59,960
He had been a client and had ran an offshore fund that avoided tax for a grand total of 30 years.

16
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:06,960
Dave had a few shares in this fund, which he benefited from and sold shortly before he came Prime Minister.

17
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,960
I'm going to make one thing clear, I'm not going to judge his role in it until I find out more information.

18
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:16,960
As I don't believe a person should be held responsible for their father's actions.

19
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:22,960
What I am going to judge is the response from these moral crusaders that we call politicians.

20
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,960
So first, let's talk about the cam man himself.

21
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:35,960
In reaction, very soon after his father was implicated, David Cameron insisted it was a private matter, a family matter, that needed respect.

22
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:41,960
The following day, the matter was no longer a private matter, as he originally implied.

23
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:44,960
And all they needed to know is that he didn't benefit from them.

24
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,960
Then, a day later, he won't be benefiting from them in the future.

25
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,960
I could go on.

26
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:56,960
Public trust for politicians has once again been shredded more than a minister's tax return document.

27
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:16,960
Now because they're not completely devoid of any sensitivity, they're not these robots that just don't understand us, though pretty close.

28
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,960
So they clearly noticed that we were losing faith.

29
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:27,960
So in that to restore this faith that had been lost, the ministers nobly released their tax details. True heroes they are.

30
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:31,960
So these tax returns are completely squeaky clean.

31
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:35,960
Obviously because they cover the income they actually claim to have.

32
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,960
Once again, political gesturing.

33
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:49,960
Though it would be curious to note that our good friend George Osborne claimed that we didn't need to see his previous tax year's returns because they weren't interesting.

34
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:53,960
Bullshit. You're talking bullshit.

35
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:57,960
Jeremy Corbyn filed his tax return a week late.

36
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,960
The mad rebel he is.

37
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,960
Don't fight with Jeremy Corbyn.

38
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:07,960
Though on the bright side, he doesn't have a taxpayer funded 53k a year fashion advisor like some do.

39
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,960
Cameron.

40
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,960
Though you wouldn't be able to tell.

41
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,960
So what did we learn from the Panama Papers?

42
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:19,960
Well that the worst part of tax avoidance is being caught.

43
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,960
Politicians have trouble telling the truth.

44
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:26,960
And that British people already knew the facts that I just stated.

45
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,960
Basically you can't trust them.

46
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,960
That was my opinion.

47
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:36,960
And I guess that was my outline on the Panama Papers and what can be drawn from it.

48
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,960
As I say, you know, it's still quite a new development.

49
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:44,960
Can't judge too much but hopefully it's not the last we'll hear about these antics.

50
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:48,960
So I'm the right opinion and I bid you farewell.
