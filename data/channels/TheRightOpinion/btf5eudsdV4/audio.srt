00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,360
Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with

2
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,360
too much free time.

3
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:15,360
And boy, don't we have a topic that everyone was anticipating me to cover.

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,240
Well looky here, now you get your wish.

5
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:21,080
I had a few topics to pick out of the hat, but I found such a fascinating one today that

6
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:25,160
I couldn't possibly ignore it, and it's obviously in part about the titular character,

7
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,560
Mr Shane Dawson here.

8
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,320
Shane Dawson, like a lot of people we talk about on this channel, is a YouTuber, I'm

9
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,000
sure many of you are already aware of this, but if you somehow just discovered this platform

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,480
and you've had the pleasure of this beautiful accent introducing you, that's what he is,

11
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:38,480
a YouTuber.

12
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,280
But he's not just any old YouTuber, he's not a geek off the street, he is one of the first

13
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,580
YouTubers to gain prominence on the platform.

14
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:48,160
This was mainly through his channel, Shane Dawson TV, the TV there clearly making it

15
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,540
sound nice and professional.

16
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:53,700
He uploaded these comedy sketch star videos, an iconic classic being Fred is Dead, in which

17
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:57,500
Shane Dawson appropriately kills Fred so he can establish himself as the most popular

18
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,980
YouTuber on the platform, which you know, I'm not complaining about.

19
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:05,380
Anyhow that was a simpler time, but as a creator it is necessary that you evolve with the times,

20
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:08,840
so as charming as these sketches and short films were, it appears that they were brought

21
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:12,320
to an end on that channel at the close of 2016.

22
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,620
What took its place though?

23
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:17,820
Well his third channel, Shane, yes he had three channels, busy bloke.

24
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:21,640
Now Shane was originally set up as a vlog channel, in the day it was almost like a back

25
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:25,440
up for him letting his followers know what's up and what's going down, with little jokes

26
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,440
and memes.

27
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:30,200
Nonetheless still with some pretty saucy clickbait, there was no throwaway thumbnail to Shane

28
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,200
it seems.

29
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,440
Anyhow in case you haven't noticed, with the increasing accessibility to high quality

30
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:38,460
equipment, vlogging has emerged in the past few years as a huge genre, along with this

31
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:43,720
other genres that crept into the public eye are mystery genres, list genres, and commentary.

32
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:47,580
Therefore Shane did what any person with a level head would do in those situations, and

33
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:52,360
made this Shane channel dedicated to morphing all of those genres together, which is pretty

34
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,680
damn genius.

35
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,600
Although as a creator, Shane was definitely aware of the consequences of mixing a range

36
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,720
of genres that are too diverse from each other, and something that his associate Bobby Burns

37
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,720
would soon find out.

38
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:06,680
And so he tended to mesh them, in a very similar style that would bring back the audience for

39
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:10,520
each video, allowing organic views to turn into suggested views, and this would grow

40
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:14,520
out some great content that had mass appeal to the multitudes of audiences, dedicated

41
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,520
and casual.

42
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,180
Bobby chose this channel probably because it had the best potential fanbase, and as

43
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:22,980
said, if you tried to mix these views with already established content in a rather distinctly

44
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:26,060
incompatible style, the algorithms loathe it.

45
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,900
So I believe this was a smart move.

46
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:31,640
On top of this, he would make some more personal videos that would branch out his character

47
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:35,720
and the relationship that he had with the audience, in a way he was building an empire.

48
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:39,580
The Shane brand not just being an interesting expansion of content for him, but also branching

49
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:44,060
out on the elements of his character, dissecting his childhood, relationships, and asking

50
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:46,720
a lot of questions with no clear answers.

51
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,520
It's emotionally riveting stuff, it really is.

52
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:54,220
I feel therefore it was an appropriate succession to continue into these documentary style videos,

53
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:57,480
that deal with many of the components that Shane had dealt with in the past, just in

54
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:02,060
a more bombastic fashion, and under the guise of an individual problem or person which is

55
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:05,960
then branched out to implicitly deal with other questions, that's typically what any

56
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:10,440
video that's not just a basic reaction video will do, but obviously there are tiers to

57
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,760
this, and Dawson Clear wanted to do top tier.

58
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:16,860
Now I recently covered the Tea Spilling saga, of which one of the people I covered was Jeffree

59
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:17,860
Star.

60
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:21,700
Jeffree Star has been in the public eye for a while, in fact he's a very prominent individual

61
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:25,420
clearly, however given the sort of brewing tea in that community, it made sense that

62
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:29,480
Shane would be interested in covering such controversial figures, however in my video

63
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:33,780
I note that this whole beauty community kind of dominated the summer and pushed other figures

64
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:37,980
like the Pauls into the background, even though they were arguably behaving much worse than

65
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:39,940
any of the beauty commentators in question.

66
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,460
So when Shane announced his next set of videos were going to be on Jake Paul, people were

67
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:48,000
a tad surprised, here is this topic that in a way is kinda dead and buried, and if Shane

68
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,800
was going to pull out his shovel, he was going to have to dig deep to find some interesting

69
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,800
content.

70
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,720
Now there was a natural air of hype surrounding this, following the success of both his previous

71
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,920
series, and this gave it a natural boost, but the first episode was rather low key for

72
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:05,160
him, and the second one came out, and although no one could deny it was fantastic production

73
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:10,260
value, there were some critics who felt that what he was discussing was fairly unnecessary.

74
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,260
Why is that?

75
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:14,380
Well, for a multitude of reasons, but we'll try and break them down, the first one being

76
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:18,260
that Jake Paul is a dead topic, everyone has an opinion, love him, hate him, and although

77
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:21,980
Shane can bring the melodrama, which he did without a doubt, we weren't going to be filled

78
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:23,620
in with any new narratives.

79
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:28,100
The one that Shane has taken on is whether Jake Paul is a sociopath, which is an interesting

80
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:32,020
narrative but one he kind of abandoned by the final episode.

81
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:36,000
Jake Paul definitely displays certain traits of a sociopath, and Dawson cleverly leaves

82
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,680
each part very open ended on that question, at the end of the day we shouldn't be going

83
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,800
around diagnosing someone formally, and that is implicitly assumed, that nothing is being

84
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,360
factually defined here.

85
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,200
However, even with that noted, many people question the point and the implications, at

86
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:53,200
the end of the day, what Jake Paul does, whether Jake Paul himself is a sociopath or not, is

87
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,600
kind of besides the point, he behaves terribly.

88
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,120
I don't make videos that are out to defend people, in fact I think I criticise more regularly

89
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:03,780
than most gents, and that gets under some people's skins, and then they get annoyed

90
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:07,460
and tell me to make original content as if using a topic that exists is somehow unoriginal,

91
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:09,620
but that's just me being bitchy.

92
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:13,020
What I found quite interesting this time around was that many approached Shane's series

93
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:17,420
with a highly critical eye, I think this was in part due to its size, and the ambitions,

94
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:21,220
I think there are a lot of levels that we can analyse this on, but this time I'm going

95
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:25,060
to discuss why I believe that the choice of Jake Paul was the correct decision, however

96
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:29,300
the subsequent handling was a mixed bag, while also attempting to be sympathetic towards

97
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,300
the criticisms.

98
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:33,840
I think however to understand the weight of the Jake Paul series, you have to understand

99
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,720
Shane first, so that's what I want to do today.

100
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,600
There are a lot of discussions about the original series, so in an attempt to give my video

101
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:44,900
more of an original spin, I'll be looking at Shane Dawson as much as we look at Jake

102
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:48,920
Paul, however to understand this we have to take a closer look at Shane's content, and

103
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:52,800
Shane himself, so without further ado, I suggest we have a little chat.

104
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:03,480
We've already discussed briefly how Shane Dawson's content really is the goldmine

105
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:08,360
in many different ways, and in 2018 that has really cemented him as a force to be reckoned

106
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,800
with, but there's a lot more to break down within the content that explores how it's

107
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,760
brought us to this moment, so I'm going to split this part into three separate points,

108
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,960
purpose, tone, and production.

109
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:22,440
So the first question is, a very broad one, what is the purpose of his content?

110
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:26,940
What does Shane set out to do when he makes a video, other than to make some sweet dollar?

111
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:30,520
After all, if the answer was just that, this video would be over a lot sooner, so he does

112
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,920
a fairly tight job of that.

113
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:36,760
I'd say the most important word that comes to mind is exploration, and this is reflected

114
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:41,640
within all forms of content, he explores conspiracy theories, he explores haunted mansions, he

115
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,640
explores himself.

116
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:46,560
The last one is exceptionally important, after all the channel is Shane, a lot of the channels

117
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,800
tend to explore these topics, some are merely structured as list channels, with some anonymous

118
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,160
hosts like Brightside, you know, the channel with that guy who sounds like he smoked some

119
00:06:55,160 --> 00:07:01,860
crack before recording, to be fair a lot of them sound like that.

120
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:06,900
I assume it's a more focus tested measure, and it works, the clickbait is disgustingly

121
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:07,900
good.

122
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:11,460
On the other hand, you have a mix, with someone like Matthew Santoro, who definitely integrates

123
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:14,980
his personality into his content, but still leaves it secondary.

124
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:18,700
Shane is a different kind of worm, because his personality is often integrated into his

125
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:23,300
content as a facet that runs alongside the topic of his video, and there's this mystery

126
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:27,680
perpetuated around his life, whether it's one of his friends who was sent to prison,

127
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,520
whether it's the relationship between him and his parents, Shane Dawson is an inherently

128
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:36,360
interesting person, who has built up a persona, and as mentioned in my animators video, we're

129
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:40,240
arguably in YouTube's most introspective era, people wanted creators who weren't

130
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,800
going to put on a facade, and for someone like Shane this was the perfect time to go

131
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,120
and explore himself.

132
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,060
I think another important point is that these explorations of self were not just limited

133
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:53,120
to Shane, as I've said before, the art of an endearing on-screen character in this

134
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:57,040
day and age is that you can take something that is specific to yourself and make other

135
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:01,160
people feel that, and this is where the tone comes into play, because it is an equally

136
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:05,540
important element of content creation that you can project a message, or a theme through

137
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:07,680
a tonally consistent presentation.

138
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,440
Shane covers topics with a lot of sympathy, and always seeks to discover someone else's

139
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,280
perspective, for example, for a long time he had a lot of animosity towards his father,

140
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:19,540
someone who had caused him a lot of emotional turmoil, in a way he had communicated a lot

141
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,940
of his emotions through that old content.

142
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:25,980
The new Shane took the established portrait that he had painted of his father, and peeled

143
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:30,580
it away in arguably one of his most sympathetic videos, it was an attempt to understand the

144
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:35,220
pain, he often asks a lot of open, general questions, which I think really allows people

145
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:39,980
to put themselves in his shoes, and it definitely reaches others who may have a similar experience.

146
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:45,720
I had a problem connecting with you, I felt like you didn't know how to talk to me, or

147
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:49,800
maybe you would get annoyed with me, or maybe I was too much, or I remember I used to put

148
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:53,320
towels on my head and pretend like it was a wig, and just like a lot of crazy things

149
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:56,900
and I felt like maybe, I don't know, I just felt like maybe you didn't get it.

150
00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:01,240
The title of the video is Confronting My Dad, and I think confronting is probably the most

151
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:05,040
appropriate word, not just the double meaning which makes a pretty damn great clickbait,

152
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,520
but also because that double meaning means he could have taken that confrontation in

153
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:12,340
a hostile environment, but actually sees it as attempting to resolve an incredibly

154
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:14,040
difficult situation.

155
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:17,600
Now we talk a lot about his production, which is obviously very dramatic and will reach

156
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,820
that bridge in a moment, but in my opinion the tone is equally aided by a lot of energy

157
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:25,560
within the interactions held between the people within these videos.

158
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:29,060
One video that stood out to me was Shane's video I'm Done, which really might seem

159
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:33,300
to many just to be a pointless video of Shane going round trying to do things, but being

160
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:37,660
thwarted at pretty much every turn, it really could have just been a throwaway set of deep

161
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:38,660
thoughts.

162
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:41,960
Yet the interaction between Shane, those around him, and particularly the cameraman carries

163
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:55,400
this unique energy that can honestly make anything interesting, equally as we'll see

164
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:59,440
in the Jake Paul series, the chemistry that Dawson and the cameraman have is definitely

165
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,960
helped by the production value that often makes situations rather tense, and then cutting

166
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:08,340
the tension with a joke or a burst of laughter that can often evoke laughter from the audience

167
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:23,700
too, as when we're nervous we tend to be more prone to such mechanisms.

168
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:27,300
And this is important because we come to these documentaries and we typically see them as

169
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:31,860
this picture of other people, Tana Mongeau, Jeffree Star, and they're equally as much

170
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:36,080
about Shane as they are about the people in the documentaries, and that simple fact

171
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:40,180
makes these stories all the more compelling because Shane has this presence like very

172
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:44,980
few other people, and even if as a fan you're not necessarily interested in the subject

173
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:49,060
of his video, the fact that you have someone like Shane on screen almost taking you personally

174
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:52,700
through it dissolves that potential boredom that you might feel, so I think a lot of people

175
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:56,420
tend to give too much credit to the production, because although it's excellent, and once

176
00:10:56,420 --> 00:11:00,040
again we'll delve into the details of that in a moment, you still need something to hold

177
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:04,120
it down. There have been some movies with fantastic production value, but the characters

178
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:09,320
are just so shit that no flashy visual is gonna work, so here equally Shane's persona

179
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:14,340
is important, what about that persona? Well as mentioned I could really switch persona

180
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:19,320
out for personality, because he wants people to see this as him, the sort of guy next door

181
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:22,720
who is almost overwhelmed by the way that things have played out and put him in this

182
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,700
position, and I'm not sceptical that this may be the case, and because of this it creates

183
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:31,380
a connection to the viewer to see someone react in a way that they would in these situations.

184
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:35,600
I find Shane's content to be attempting to balance formula with individuality, if you

185
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,420
lean too much into the former, you'll come across as inauthentic and end up with that

186
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:43,960
bright side style content, which although successful right now, will be forgotten, if

187
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:48,820
you lean too much towards individuality, you'll end up with shapeless videos, so his persona

188
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:53,340
is an excellent mediator, and with production, well we have to discuss that too because it

189
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:57,580
has been the attraction of acclaim, and stigma in the past few weeks, we've had countless

190
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:01,740
videos on YouTube of manipulation in the last year, the sort of stuff that Prince EA does,

191
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:05,420
you play the emotional music and it gets to people, and suddenly they believe you're

192
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:09,060
a messiah, but in the last year people have become increasingly aware of that, and although

193
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:13,060
inspirational speakers are by no means off the platform, I'd say the audience is more

194
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:17,980
soccer mum suffering a mid-life crisis, people on the commentary side have a more critical

195
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:21,680
eye, and that means that he has to have a dramatic tone that suits, but doesn't feel

196
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,220
like it's trying to manipulate the framing.

197
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:28,400
Now we as people have weird standards, we don't mind certain emotions being manipulated,

198
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:32,400
but we do get annoyed if others are, the one we'd probably like to keep most protected

199
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:37,340
is that of pity, everyone knows that a sad, emotional YouTuber turning on the camera to

200
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:41,820
stare at you, take a deep breath, and then let the emotional piano music play.

201
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:45,900
So with Shane in a way, although we do get a lot of dramatic moments, arguably the best

202
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:50,080
of his content is when he lets all that production value go, and carries the moment with his

203
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:54,560
personality, and that's what in a way makes him more endearing than a lot of creators.

204
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:58,760
On the other hand, we have some ideas of the unknown, mystery, we love them to be blown

205
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:03,060
out of proportion because it fascinates and stimulates us, and that's what Shane does,

206
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:06,920
he knows what people are most skeptical of being dramatised and feigned, and grips those

207
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:11,400
moments with his personality, and then takes what people enjoy and makes the most significant

208
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,280
thing happening in their lives.

209
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:17,520
We don't like our perception of people manipulated, but when dealing with concepts like conspiracy

210
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,600
theories, we kinda crave it.

211
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,940
Dawson does a good job of making each video a visceral experience, while at the same time

212
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:28,480
never appearing like he's set on taking advantage of it, finding that balance of person

213
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,800
and production.

214
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,400
Which brings us to his latest venture of content.

215
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:43,840
So going back to Jake Paul, with all this in mind, people did give Dawson some stick

216
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:48,460
for his second episode, particularly in how he dramatised the nature of being a sociopath.

217
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:52,920
You see, this was an interesting concept, as the notion of sociopathy is kinda scary,

218
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:57,720
is kinda dramatic, is kinda mysterious, is kinda out there, sociopaths may appear to

219
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,120
be a bit threatening.

220
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,000
Shane did what he normally did with these concepts, and played it off in this huge way,

221
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,200
even down to the minor details, like synchronising winks with intense percussion, however in

222
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:11,840
doing that he also annoyed a few people who felt humanity within the subject.

223
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:15,880
At the end of the day, whether we like it or not, sociopaths are people, and kinda framing

224
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:21,000
it to be this awful, world-ending nature, well, some people felt that this was insensitive.

225
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,120
I think in this instance it is a case of separating the sociopathy from the sociopath, and maybe

226
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:30,140
Shane treated it with a bit too much overlap which rubbed people the wrong way, but I also

227
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:33,240
think that I understood where he was coming from, and at the end of the day he had to

228
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,560
include some people, because it is an inherently human problem.

229
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,520
The problem is that some people see sociopaths as people suffering from conditions beyond

230
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:45,080
their control, and attempt to brand the condition in such a way kinda puts Jake Paul's questionable

231
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:50,500
actions under a shallow explanation, as not every sociopath behaves like Jake Paul.

232
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,660
The whole episode's point was kinda lost because at the end of the day, even though

233
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:57,960
sociopathy is a serious thing that can cause a threat to those around you, it doesn't

234
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:01,920
really change the fact that people are individuals, and so what if Jake Paul's a sociopath or

235
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:02,920
not?

236
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:06,000
Some actions still shouldn't have been committed regardless of the actor's mental state,

237
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,160
I think many people don't want an explanation, they want action.

238
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:12,600
But on the other hand, I kinda liked the tone, even though it was more theoretical

239
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,600
than anything else.

240
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,400
I think within the context of Shane's channel, and Shane's journey, it was the right thing

241
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,400
to do.

242
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,400
Why is that?

243
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:23,680
Well, his first documentary series was about TanaCon, this famous little disaster, and

244
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,240
at the centre of TanaCon was the titular character, Tana Moncho.

245
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:31,400
Tana is a very curious and polarising character on the platform, many have claimed that she

246
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:36,040
is disingenuous, and after the whole iDubbb situation, you can kinda see why, and so when

247
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:39,460
Shane came in from this angle, we all knew that he was going to give it his treatment

248
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:41,760
of providing it from a sympathetic perspective.

249
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:45,400
But even with that said, what we got was a series with a very emotional ending, and a

250
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:50,320
very riveting last episode with an emotional Tana Moncho, and many people were won over

251
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,320
by this.

252
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:55,760
However, many people also said, well honestly I think Shane was a bit too soft on Tana,

253
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:58,760
because at the end of the day, regardless of the remorse that she might feel, it still

254
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:02,800
happened, and she shouldn't just be able to cry her way into a position of sanctity.

255
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,640
So this is how Shane's always been, finding the other person's perspective and hearing

256
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:11,440
them out, however this is what leads us to the necessity of the Jake Paul series.

257
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,980
Firstly Jake Paul is hated, he has been the recipient of countless amounts of criticism

258
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:19,560
by commentators, he's insensitive, obnoxious, and frankly rather unlikable, and personality

259
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:23,120
aside he has been called out for multiple wrongdoings and major mishaps, while frequently

260
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,880
showing little regard or remorse or motivation to reconcile these problems or criticisms.

261
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:31,600
After all it might just be the formula that made him famous, why would he change it?

262
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,520
Shane's outlook on this situation is ambitious to say the least, but as with anything you

263
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:39,800
have to raise the stakes or else the audience becomes disinterested.

264
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:43,280
Secondly Shane Dawson has gone around, met a lot of people, many of these people who

265
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:47,640
have done very questionable things, yet have come off in the moment as kind, thoughtful,

266
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:51,560
outgoing positive people, and the Jake Paul series represents not just an analysis of

267
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:56,240
Jake Paul, but a double take at all the previous people that he has covered, and he even mentions

268
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:20,580
and shows some of them there.

269
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:24,680
Everything that Shane Dawson has constructed is now being questioned by himself, what if

270
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:29,080
the Empire is a lie, after all sociopaths come in many shapes and sizes, and if one

271
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:33,160
of these people that Shane has covered wasn't actually genuine in how they feel, why would

272
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:36,340
we want to transmit such a message to the audience?

273
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:41,000
What if all of Tana's tears were an act to maintain a subscriber base, if she frames

274
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,840
it as an honest mistake, but actually she doesn't really care about the consequences,

275
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,320
then should she really be supported?

276
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:51,240
If a tree falls in a forest and no one is there to hear it, did it ever make a sound?

277
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,480
Yes, but you wouldn't know that.

278
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:58,160
So when we have that final arc in episode 8, this very sympathetic installment where

279
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:02,840
Jake is arguably at his most vulnerable, emotional, it tugs on the heartstrings, the question

280
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:06,640
still looms of whether this all was a very finely tuned act.

281
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,160
Whether this was Shane's intention with the whole sociopath narrative is another question,

282
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,960
and the fact that it's barely mentioned in the last couple episodes moves the discussion

283
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:18,000
to the background, but if you keep it in mind, it does still work.

284
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,480
And that's the thing, being a sociopath is slightly disjunct from the actions, without

285
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,960
a doubt, obviously it's a causal factor, but being a sociopath doesn't predispose

286
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,720
you to do something, nor does it mean that you won't do something, but it's definitely

287
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:36,320
a lot more closely tied to the motives, and honestly I'd say, dependent on the actions,

288
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,440
sometimes motives are more important to people, even if it's not practical, the problem

289
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:44,720
with people who are fake is not what has happened, it's what could happen.

290
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,040
We like to know the people around us, we like to know their intentions, at the end of the

291
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:52,940
day when someone's an unknown capacity, when they may be behaving in a fake manner,

292
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:53,940
what are they gonna do?

293
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:57,120
I want to be able to trust people around me, don't you?

294
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:02,240
You can never have a clear answer on who's what, a sociopath is not necessarily going

295
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,400
to admit they are one, and mostly you will have to judge from actions, but Shane's

296
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,600
series definitely throws these concepts that we thought we knew up in the air, and I guess

297
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:15,200
it gives us a more in-depth look at working out how to define these individuals, what

298
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,280
we've seen is that people are starting to like Jake Paul throughout these episodes,

299
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:23,080
but equally, no matter how likeable he is, we don't know if it's all an excellent

300
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:27,520
act or not, because that's one of the traits of the best sociopaths, he's on camera,

301
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:31,640
of course he's gonna behave in a specific way, if he's a sociopath, our own belief

302
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:36,840
is all we have to judge, and that's the thing, looking at it from just a sociopath

303
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:41,480
basics perspective is pointless, does the fact that he's a sociopath change what he's

304
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:45,080
done and the damage he's inflicted? No, but it could definitely influence how his

305
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:48,980
future mentality is, when approaching these situations, if he doesn't feel remorse

306
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:53,400
for these things and has no drive to do better, then it's hard to support, and no, we'll

307
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:57,360
never be able to tell, but you have to be able to pass judgement on a person, these

308
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:02,000
things aren't provable, a sociopath is a formal term, but we all judge people, and

309
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,760
we don't want people who are gonna be frauds and lie in our lives because at the end of

310
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:09,800
the day, whether that's in our control or not, it still has a negative effect on those

311
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:14,960
around them, and we've got enough negativity to deal with already, we can't deny that.

312
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:20,640
However, with all that said, this doesn't mean that he nor the series are above criticism.

313
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:30,200
What can make the series its most appealing is equally what can make the series its weakest,

314
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:34,740
which ultimately comes down to Shane's lack of knowledge on Jake Paul specifically. In

315
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:38,800
one way this is a positive, as the first few episodes take us through the journey without

316
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:43,880
the assumption that the viewer will be as knowledgeable of Jake's antics. This maximises

317
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:47,840
the appeal of the content that he crafts, if you know nothing about Jake, then the series

318
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:52,280
will bring you up to a relatively reasonable pace, but equally the pace is only reasonable,

319
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:56,320
and really if you want to break Jake Paul down, you have to up a few gears.

320
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:00,520
And that's one of Shane's weaknesses, he seems so driven on building a connection

321
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:04,640
to understand the target of a series that he tended to avoid asking the really hard

322
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,680
questions, and in a way I understand. He says multiple times during the series that

323
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:12,360
he doesn't want to upset Jake Paul and those around him, but the truth of the matter is

324
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:15,960
that sometimes we need to crack a few eggs to make an omelette, and that doesn't mean

325
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:20,760
being unnecessarily aggressive, but it does mean being assertive and addressing the actual

326
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,780
points, where there are many examples where Jake gets off lightly, and there are many

327
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:27,280
videos that cover this, but I'll pick out an example that demonstrates this the most.

328
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:31,120
One of the important points that Shane addresses in his episode with Nick Crompton is that

329
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,040
if Jake Paul is caught being dishonest, Shane will just leave.

330
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:48,000
Now this sounds like Shane is taking a hard stance, but the question is, how can you tell

331
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,040
when Jake is lying? And the truth is, you can't, and therefore the audience have to

332
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:57,120
be the jurist to an extent on such a presentation, and Shane as the documentarian cannot say

333
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:01,080
with certainty when Jake is lying or not. With that said, Shane can decide the questions

334
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:05,320
to ask, and asking the right questions is a position that comes with significant power,

335
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:10,200
especially in an environment where you could be dictating someone's image on such a platform.

336
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:13,520
One of the narratives that came to the forefront following Nick Crompton's episode was that

337
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:24,200
an extremely high majority of the Team 10 tomfoolery was fake.

338
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:28,400
This as a defence was relatively resolute against the claims being made by former members

339
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:43,160
such as the Martinez Twins, who cited such pranks as reference to Jake's abuse of power.

340
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:46,840
However on the other hand, this did not undermine the criticism that had been presented against

341
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:50,960
him with regards to the involvement of children in the Team 10 house, and Jake's treatment

342
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,520
of them, which could be summarised as rather dubious.

343
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:49,680
The

344
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:53,360
problem is that you can't provide a disclaimer to toddlers, they haven't developed a mental

345
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:57,780
stage where they can distinguish between simulated entertainment and reality. Some of the clips

346
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:01,920
shown are incredibly uncomfortable, and show children in legitimate distress, and really

347
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:06,360
do remind me of a more notorious YouTube couple. Although I won't say that he's that bad,

348
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:09,960
it is still something that should be brought up, and I thought they were going to do this

349
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:14,780
when they decide to discuss Nerd City's video which amplified these concerns significantly.

350
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:18,940
Yet despite clearly watching the video, Shane merely brought up the criticism of merchandising

351
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:23,100
to younger children, which is another legitimate point but doesn't encompass the numerous

352
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:35,500
problems that video brought up. On top of that, during that discussion it was quickly

353
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:40,020
diverted to how the messages he spreads towards impressionable children on topics such as

354
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:44,540
education can damage their mentality, which although once again is another point worth

355
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:48,840
considering, it means that we never received a proper answer on the problem of coercive

356
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:53,480
merchandising because they don't have exactly the same implications. That's the thing,

357
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:57,960
in many instances Shane Dawson delivered the most softball form of criticism to Jake, and

358
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:01,600
I believe this was done in the notion of not causing disruption, but I think there were

359
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,480
times when the conviction of finding the truth trumped that, because people would deserve

360
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:09,880
an honest portrayal, and by choosing the easiest criticisms it allowed Jake to sidestep a lot

361
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:14,120
of it and come out unscarred. Which is a shame, because really it seemed like Jake was willing

362
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:18,020
to own up to a lot of his misconduct, and with the right wording it may have given him

363
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:22,180
more possibility to reflect on his behaviour, for me it makes the series feel like a missed

364
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:26,340
opportunity in some ways. There's no doubting that there are some strong insights, but equally

365
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:30,740
because Shane is the one asking the questions, his naivety on the topics undermine the true

366
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:35,520
reality of what is going on or what has gone on in the Team 10 house. The lack of knowledge

367
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:40,020
also surfaced when dealing with the situation regarding FaZe Banks, publicised by Jake yet

368
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:43,900
with very little visible evidence. In the sixth episode Jake seemed to dismiss all these

369
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:48,100
claims and then make comments about those, such as Max Beaumont and their behaviour,

370
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:50,220
basically setting everyone else up as liars.

371
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:08,420
This was mildly amended by the eighth episode, but it was still hard to obtain any closure

372
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:12,300
as he kinda just turned it into the ignorance narrative, and with all these arguments being

373
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:16,220
pushed towards him, I feel like Shane then reinforced that narrative by making comments

374
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:19,940
about lack of accountability, and even if this was partially true, it would have been

375
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:24,020
better to let Jake explain it himself, rather than having explanations presented by other

376
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:26,540
people and then him going, yes I agree.

377
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:51,980
And I do admit, the overarching narrative of accountability for actions and being aware

378
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:56,500
for consequences is present, and that can't be taken away, credit where it's due.

379
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:06,100
Naivety however can only explain so much, and I feel if some more hard hitting criticisms

380
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:10,140
have been pushed, we would have seen elaborate explanations that tell us about this character,

381
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:12,940
other than just, well, Jake Paul's an impulsive fool.

382
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:33,140
I don't think Jake Paul's an awful person, I do think there is a legitimately sympathetic

383
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:37,220
take on it, but as someone who is extremely sceptical, these little omissions mean that

384
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:41,060
it's hard to take his responses as a reasonable explanation, and although the mystery is a

385
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:44,740
part of it, mystery should come from desire, not doubt.

386
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:48,620
And this really comes down to Shane and his framing, as said, this series could have equally

387
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:52,380
been about Shane as it is about Jake, and I think it just says that Shane could have

388
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:56,120
really taken that extra step, but his lack of knowledge and lack of confidence in that

389
00:27:56,120 --> 00:28:01,300
knowledge subsequently caused a lack of conviction in some harsher criticisms of Mr Paul here.

390
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:05,440
You have to ask the hard questions sometimes, and I'm sure from this, some people felt

391
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:10,920
sold short on the series, myself included, there was more criticism than just my own criticism.

392
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:29,400
As said, I do believe there can be motivations attributed towards the Jake Paul series, however

393
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:33,200
if you're a new viewer to it, or someone who has different priorities in what they

394
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,960
think should be the intention, it's very possible that the theme that Dawson crafted

395
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,740
isn't one that's going to work for you.

396
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:43,240
You could come out of the second episode thinking, what the hell was the point of that, I mean

397
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:47,560
it's visually exciting and well presented and great and all that entertaining content,

398
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:50,900
what the fuck does it matter whether Jake Paul's a sociopath or not?

399
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:54,840
And Dawson, in spite of what I believe were fair justifications and offences, although

400
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:59,680
as said, I believe the idea of sociopathy was a component of a greater narrative revealed

401
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:03,740
later on, at the time he kinda had no reply, I think there were people who watched the

402
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:07,920
video at the time and just saw this guy asking whether Jake Paul was a sociopath, the whole

403
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:12,720
notion of sociopath encompassing this episode, and I completely understand that, it's clear

404
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:17,000
that he didn't define each feature well enough, it's also clear that he may have rubbed some

405
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,520
people the wrong way, although I don't see any problem with dramatising a transcendent

406
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:24,400
condition that stands independently, he may have failed to draw the line clearly enough,

407
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,920
and I do agree there.

408
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:30,480
Now, do I think it was worth becoming angry about it like some people did? Of course not,

409
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:35,840
it seemed more like a tonal mishandling rather than actual malice or purposeful insensitivity.

410
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:39,480
One thing you have to accept when making these videos for exceptionally large audiences is

411
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:43,280
that you're going to receive substantial criticism from one side or the other, many

412
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:46,840
of this may just be Jake Paul is irrationally complaining that you're making a video on

413
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:50,520
someone they like, but there will be some legitimate criticisms which is why you have

414
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:54,520
to walk a very thin line, because on one hand if you move too far in one direction you'll

415
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:58,400
risk using a condition as a way to attack a person's character, thus weaponising

416
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:02,520
the condition, and if you move too far in the other way, you risk validating their heinous

417
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:06,520
actions. At the end of the day, someone like Jake Paul may have sociopathic tendencies,

418
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:10,960
but there has to be some level of awareness if he wants to take on the responsibilities

419
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:15,700
of a public figure because his actions have consequences. However, understanding this

420
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:19,520
means that there is a spectrum that this can be on, and if you lean a bit one way or the

421
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:23,680
other it might still be acceptable, because every single element when you create content

422
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:27,740
has a minor effect on which way something might be interpreted, even if it comes down

423
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:31,740
to just feelings that are evoked by people. You have to understand that a true neutral

424
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:35,880
is pretty much impossible, even though we try our goddamn best. With the levels that

425
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:40,320
Dawson is using, not just in his narratives but also in his production and his interaction,

426
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:43,760
and everything we've discussed today, it means that it is exceptionally tough, and

427
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:47,960
the only way to begin to find that neutral point of view is to completely alienate yourself

428
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:51,960
from the situation, and that is something that Dawson cannot afford to do. Equally this

429
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:55,760
means that whichever way you lean, there are going to be people who are quite pedantic

430
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:59,320
who are going to pick up on that. Obviously the less you lean the harder it will be for

431
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:04,080
someone to interpret it that way, but it is inevitability, especially with Shane's expansive

432
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:07,920
audience, and further to this he's under pressure from those around him with how he

433
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:12,520
frames Jake Paul. As said earlier, Shane has a habit of being very friendly and sympathetic

434
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:16,800
towards the subjects of his videos, however, whereas on one hand you have people like Tana

435
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:21,200
who although definitely have their enemies, still have a reasonable reputation, many people

436
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:25,960
believe that the manipulation that Jake was conducting as documented by videos like Nerd

437
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:31,080
Cities giving him almost a quote redemption arc is a step too far, it gives him a sympathetic

438
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:34,920
explanation of this established reputation, to them it's not a case of explanation,

439
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:40,040
it is a case of cancellation, these actions still have impacts. Like Fousey, even though

440
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:43,840
he may have his issues, does it mean it can continue? Then you have a set of people who

441
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:48,200
just feel uncomfortable with you talking on the topic or having opinions on topics because

442
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:51,960
you're seen as this huge influencer, and these fans who watch your videos are too easily

443
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:56,120
coerced by your opinions and then they adopt it themselves, and some people would rather

444
00:31:56,120 --> 00:32:00,680
individuals watch just Jake Paul rather than watch someone having opinions on it, and this

445
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:06,160
extends all over it. Now obviously I have various opinions on these individual criticisms,

446
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:09,680
some are well grounded, others not as much, I don't think it's useful to the purpose

447
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:14,640
of the video to provide my individual opinions on each individual critique, the problem is

448
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:18,040
that Shane has attempted to stay neutral, that every time he's veered one way or the

449
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:22,160
other there have been piranhas on either side waiting to have a good nash at his posterior,

450
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:26,120
and even then the interpretive overlap will mean that there will be people who see him

451
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:30,160
as being too harsh on one thing and not harsh enough on another. Now in those instances

452
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:33,880
you can't agree with every single piece of criticism without ending up contradicting

453
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:38,600
yourself to an extent, having an opinion on these things will typically ensue some disagreements

454
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:42,480
with how someone's interpreted it, if we all agreed on the interpretation, chances

455
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:46,640
are the criticism would be pretty uniform, if you want to decide how to respond you need

456
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:50,480
to consider multiple things, how your response is going to make you look, how your response

457
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:54,560
is going to make the original criticism look. I have to be careful, because for every fuck

458
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:58,320
you comment from some 12 year old Jake Pauler you'll have someone else come in with an

459
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:02,540
eloquently worded but nonetheless questionable statement. Now I said I wouldn't respond,

460
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:06,440
but to make an example I find this one rather silly, at the end of the day he shouldn't

461
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:10,520
have to exclude the parents in the discussion of whether they influenced Jake Paul, he wasn't

462
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:14,600
outly accusing anything, nor was he saying that it invalidated the idea that Jake Paul

463
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:18,640
may be a bad person, but to have opinions on these matters is a natural, yet at the

464
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:22,960
same time many people thought these made complete sense because it was based on the assumption

465
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:27,760
that Shane Dawson was outly accusing someone, so he needs to respond in a diplomatic fashion

466
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:33,040
and identify that false premise, and that's where it becomes problematic.

467
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:37,400
Shane Dawson wants to please people, that is a basic analysis I would give of how he

468
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,200
Now in my opinion, given the many sensitive topics he's covered and hype provided, this

469
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:46,440
was always going to be his most controversial series, however I think he went into it with

470
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:51,120
a slightly wishful mindset, and the belief that his sympathetic, often impartial framing

471
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:55,160
would offset some of the criticism, and the criticism isn't exactly harsh proportionally

472
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:59,120
for his series, but there was no way he was going to compromise it due to people's differing

473
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:03,720
views on mental health, and how it should be dealt with, you can never eradicate that.

474
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:07,180
However Shane Dawson is a sensitive person, and you could tell that he was really trying

475
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:11,420
to keep up with every single individual criticism of his series, and that's something that

476
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:15,000
when you're Shane Dawson's side you just can't do, you can't just pick out every

477
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,900
single criticism and respond to it, because it's going to be on such an extensive spectrum

478
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:22,700
that you just end up burning yourself out. And I'm someone who loves to respond to

479
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:26,660
criticism and debate things about myself, and justify myself, because I want people

480
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:30,900
to know exactly what I mean, and what my intentions are, a discussion with a perception of you

481
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:35,180
that you feel has been misconstrued, and your points have fallen to the wayside, however

482
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:38,620
dealing with all these negative perceptions of you and your content is one of the most

483
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:42,640
draining things ever. One of the many pieces of advice that a large YouTuber will give

484
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:46,780
you is, don't read the comments, I used to read and reply to every single comment because

485
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:51,060
it's good to do if you can, however as you grow to a considerable size you'll realise

486
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:55,000
that dealing with mass amounts of negativity, even when it's well expressed, and having

487
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,880
to deal with so many conflicting criticisms, some that will completely contradict themselves,

488
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:04,060
takes a toll on your position. Now I became used to this as I make opinionated content,

489
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:07,700
but I piss people off, that's who I am, I do my best to be polite, but you can't

490
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:11,500
please everyone, and equally I can express myself poorly on the occasion, and if you

491
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:15,340
slip up, they are on you. Now I still look at a few comments, particularly on uploads

492
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:19,140
and often see what's being said in the top, but I know to try not to respond to every

493
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:24,220
single comment. Shane Dawson is doing the equivalent of that on his Twitter, he's

494
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:27,980
being added by swathes of people who have their opinions, and although it's definitely

495
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:31,960
worth paying attention to the criticism, responding to every individual tweet where you're going

496
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:35,480
to end up repeating yourself to a lot of these comments isn't good for you. At the

497
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:38,840
end of the day, you have to get a feel of where the main criticism may lie, try to avoid

498
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:43,440
catering to too many outliers, and then address them at the start of a video or something,

499
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:47,300
and although he did do the latter eventually, he definitely had trouble being dragged back

500
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:51,500
into the fray, which eventually became so stressful he ended up taking a break. You

501
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:55,880
spend a lot of time and work creating something that is exceptionally precious to you, and

502
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:59,400
you see someone challenging exactly what you thought it stood for, and you want to defend

503
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:03,320
that work while simultaneously quieting them down. Confronting them out of the open is

504
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:07,620
often the most direct way to deal with criticism, however equally it can bring about more attention

505
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:11,020
to it, and although criticism shouldn't just be hidden away, responding in such a

506
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:14,240
fashion can do more harm than good to you, even if it's fully debunked.

507
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:17,960
But that's the thing about Shane, you can always tell that he wants the validation and

508
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:21,920
the positive energy from his audience, and that always comes down to an image, whereas

509
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:25,680
on one side you have someone like Jay Pool who has set up such an antagonistic character

510
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:30,200
who is well hated and just plays into it, you have Shane who wants to be this arbiter,

511
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:34,800
this guy who can provide an impartial, sympathetic look at people. So this hits him hard, and

512
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:39,000
this hits even worse because of who Shane is, this person who is really ready to seek

513
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,640
the approval of those viewers, and he knows that a slip up could undermine a squeaky clean

514
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:49,600
image, so he goes all out to protect it, responding to countless people. But this mentality and

515
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:53,280
this philosophy can say a lot about Shane himself, and that's where we'll go now.

516
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:11,600
Shane has shown he is someone who has had a lot of difficulty in his life, whether

517
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:15,400
it was bullying, domestic abuse, or weight, I think these are all things that drive many

518
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:19,320
people towards the internet, and when Shane Dawson set up his channel, he probably saw

519
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:24,840
it as an outlet in a way, it is a place for many outcasts, and slowly through interactions

520
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:29,100
you start working out how to really channel whatever creative energy you have into something

521
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:33,240
much better and much more productive. Shane is someone who has had the chance to explore

522
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:37,400
many creative elements of himself, but I really feel this is an automaton for him, and that

523
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:41,820
really what this content represents is an opportunity, an opportunity to search for

524
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:46,000
closure of his issues, and it's one of the things when you have to deal with these problems

525
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,400
it is extremely difficult to find that closure. And in a way, you can tell by the attention

526
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:54,040
to detail that Shane pays, especially with his production, that he is a perfectionist,

527
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:58,240
and I think that equally reflects in himself, as simple as it sounds, he wants to work

528
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:03,000
out what is wrong with people, and how to make it right, himself included, it's just

529
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,600
where as someone else you can talk to them, and you can give them advice on issues, Shane

530
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:09,680
is the sort of person who has answered a lot of these questions, but knows there are a

531
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:14,080
lot of deeper things within himself that he's not sure how to fully resolve, in a way many

532
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:17,160
of us give the best advice, but we seldom take it.

533
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:21,000
And by looking back at his content, past and present, that's what we see, the one thing

534
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,640
that doesn't change is Shane, Shane is a person who audiences can resonate with,

535
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:30,400
he's someone who understands that life is shit sometimes, and when you experience turmoil,

536
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:34,440
there is seldom a one way solution that will make your life just all rosy, because life

537
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:39,200
isn't like that, and I think that these videos represent an expression of that search,

538
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:43,660
a series of existential questions looking for explanations of why someone would behave

539
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:48,160
in the way they do, and equally asking how much control we have over our own instincts

540
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,160
and behaviour.

541
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:53,000
With Jake Paul, we see Shane looking into the more troubled minds, not just to understand

542
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:58,840
them, but to understand himself, we're discussing issues like parental influence, personal accountability,

543
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:03,160
mental illness, all these factors being very prevalent in Shane's own life, and he even

544
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,160
says it.

545
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:08,840
Shane- Even for me, like why do I want to get so deep with people and talk to people

546
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:12,860
and like try to help them and fix them, why do I want to cry with them, why, like what

547
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:13,860
is that?

548
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:18,780
For him, these not dissimilar factors send us down different paths, maybe Shane sees

549
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:21,260
a bit of himself in everyone.

550
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:24,540
I don't know if Shane's ever gonna find what he's looking for, because it clearly

551
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:28,940
feels like these videos represent a look inside himself, for him to understand why he has

552
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:33,660
these mental struggles, and if he can, how he can rewire it, equally I'd say with the

553
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:38,220
criticism in mind, he's gonna have to ask some harder questions, because even though

554
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:42,580
he may not want to upset others, if he wants to find the truth within himself, he may have

555
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:46,340
to put the questions out there, I can't speak exactly for why he cares so much about

556
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:50,120
the responses and the people and justifying himself, but as someone who feels the same

557
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:54,500
way, a lot of it I'd say comes down to the anxiety of an incorrect interpretation of

558
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:57,260
the message being spread, and the wrong image with you.

559
00:39:57,260 --> 00:40:00,740
As a creator being presented, it's just important to remember that it's actually

560
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:04,620
a very small proportion of people who've watched your video who are actually criticising

561
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:05,620
it.

562
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:09,860
That's what I see with regards to Jake Paul, a character study, the search for an explanation,

563
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:13,980
and not just works as an excellent succession and reflection of his previous videos, asking

564
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:17,920
the hard questions about what isn't real, it equally asks about his life, what if the

565
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:22,540
elements he has constructed so finely isn't real, and the empathy and sympathy that he

566
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:26,460
covers with it, gives a universal appeal to audiences that will leave people questioning

567
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:30,360
their friends and families for days, we're witnessing the story of characters who we

568
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:32,940
thought we knew, but are always questioning.

569
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:37,100
So what about the future, the future of his content, the future of Shane Dawson, I think

570
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:41,220
we'll likely see more of these documentaries that investigate human nature in the way that

571
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:45,460
Jake Paul represents, I think that even though it's kind of a dead topic, the overarching

572
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:49,620
nature that he addresses them with always has a timeless appeal, and that is something

573
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:51,420
that is simply undeniable.

574
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:55,580
Maybe this new series won't be on the nose like Jake Paul is, it may deal with it from

575
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:59,980
a more third person perspective like the Jeffree Star series, but it will still be posing these

576
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:04,460
questions to the audiences, and I'm glad he's made the series, as it may help some

577
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:08,820
people understand themselves, and therefore although maybe turning sociopathy into a bit

578
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:13,860
of a dazzling jumped up dramatised talking point, he kinda contradicted the normal humanism

579
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:18,120
and represented a tough compromise between two very constraining elements that he's

580
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:21,620
been trying to balance, and inevitably that attracted some criticism.

581
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:25,220
With regards to Shane, from what I've watched, he'll often put himself in the centre of

582
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:29,160
the documentaries, even though they're on other people, he's arguably just as much

583
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:33,920
the focus as them, and he'll often ask the questions placing himself in those situations

584
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,940
and try to work out who he is.

585
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:39,600
Even in his Jake Paul video, which spent a lot of time asking about sociopathy, he would

586
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:44,640
equally ask about himself and his state, and how he would be classed under these prerequisites.

587
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:52,000
I think that is like, when I was a kid, you know, my mom was going through a lot, and

588
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:58,360
I felt like I had to be strong, because she was like, having trouble, so it was always

589
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:03,120
like, oh Shane's my rock, he's my support system, oh he's always strong.

590
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,120
So I like-

591
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:05,120
Do that for other people in your life now, too?

592
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:07,120
Are you like a fixer?

593
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:08,120
Yeah.

594
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:09,120
Yeah.

595
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,120
Yeah.

596
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:13,600
Because you were like a parentified child, so you've been like an adult since you were

597
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:14,600
whatever age.

598
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:15,600
Yeah.

599
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:16,600
Yeah.

600
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:22,040
And I think, now I'm just at the point where I'm like, I like stay up all night, and I'm

601
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,980
just lost, and I'm just like, oh.

602
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:28,280
Which is why I started falling down the holes of like, sociopaths and this and that, because

603
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:32,560
I'm like, what's wrong with me, like, why am I so lost, if I can help all these people

604
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:35,920
why can't I help myself, why am I still depressed, why am I all these things?

605
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:44,080
I look at my channel, and I'm like, oh, the more I'm helping people, the worse I'm getting.

606
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:48,680
My prediction is that these videos, as great as they are, will have to come to an end eventually,

607
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:52,400
and may come to an end with Shane Dawson having built up the character throughout the whole

608
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,240
series, finally confronting himself.

609
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:57,960
That would be the most poetic way to conclude this whole saga, at least.

610
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:01,480
I don't think I'll ever be fully able to answer the questions he poses to himself,

611
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:06,360
and implies to us, through this series, because they're ones that no one can ever fully answer,

612
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:10,280
but I hope that he finds some closure, and through that, inspire others to find their

613
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:11,280
own.

614
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:17,800
So yeah, Shane Dawson, net positive, with a few flaws, I think that's fair enough.

615
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:22,080
Alright, I want to give a massive shoutout to the editors, they've done a stellar job,

616
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:26,200
go and check them out if you can, I'm gonna leave their links in the pinned comments,

617
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:30,100
they're brilliant people, brilliantly talented people, definitely go and check them out.

618
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:33,700
On the other hand, I wanna say that if you wanna reach me, if you wanna talk about this

619
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:37,460
topic, leave a comment below, but also you can reach me through Twitter, which is just

620
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:41,500
as productive, or Facebook, or Discord, links in the pinned comment below.

621
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:46,420
Anyhow, because I'm really tired, and a mess, I might go and get some sleep now.

622
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:51,140
I appreciate you guys being here, it really does make a difference, and I hope that this

623
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:52,900
video makes a difference too.

624
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:57,900
So until then, I'm The Right Opinion, and I'll see you in the next one, love you guys.

625
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:01,100
Bye.

626
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:01,120
Bye.

627
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:31,100
Bye.

628
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:32,100
Bye.
