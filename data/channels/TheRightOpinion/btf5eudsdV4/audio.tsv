0	9360	Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with
9360	10360	too much free time.
10360	15360	And boy, don't we have a topic that everyone was anticipating me to cover.
15360	17240	Well looky here, now you get your wish.
17240	21080	I had a few topics to pick out of the hat, but I found such a fascinating one today that
21080	25160	I couldn't possibly ignore it, and it's obviously in part about the titular character,
25160	26560	Mr Shane Dawson here.
26560	30320	Shane Dawson, like a lot of people we talk about on this channel, is a YouTuber, I'm
30320	34000	sure many of you are already aware of this, but if you somehow just discovered this platform
34000	37480	and you've had the pleasure of this beautiful accent introducing you, that's what he is,
37480	38480	a YouTuber.
38480	42280	But he's not just any old YouTuber, he's not a geek off the street, he is one of the first
42280	44580	YouTubers to gain prominence on the platform.
44580	48160	This was mainly through his channel, Shane Dawson TV, the TV there clearly making it
48160	49540	sound nice and professional.
49540	53700	He uploaded these comedy sketch star videos, an iconic classic being Fred is Dead, in which
53700	57500	Shane Dawson appropriately kills Fred so he can establish himself as the most popular
57500	60980	YouTuber on the platform, which you know, I'm not complaining about.
60980	65380	Anyhow that was a simpler time, but as a creator it is necessary that you evolve with the times,
65380	68840	so as charming as these sketches and short films were, it appears that they were brought
68840	72320	to an end on that channel at the close of 2016.
72320	73620	What took its place though?
73620	77820	Well his third channel, Shane, yes he had three channels, busy bloke.
77820	81640	Now Shane was originally set up as a vlog channel, in the day it was almost like a back
81640	85440	up for him letting his followers know what's up and what's going down, with little jokes
85440	86440	and memes.
86440	90200	Nonetheless still with some pretty saucy clickbait, there was no throwaway thumbnail to Shane
90200	91200	it seems.
91200	94440	Anyhow in case you haven't noticed, with the increasing accessibility to high quality
94440	98460	equipment, vlogging has emerged in the past few years as a huge genre, along with this
98460	103720	other genres that crept into the public eye are mystery genres, list genres, and commentary.
103720	107580	Therefore Shane did what any person with a level head would do in those situations, and
107580	112360	made this Shane channel dedicated to morphing all of those genres together, which is pretty
112360	113680	damn genius.
113680	117600	Although as a creator, Shane was definitely aware of the consequences of mixing a range
117600	121720	of genres that are too diverse from each other, and something that his associate Bobby Burns
121720	122720	would soon find out.
122720	126680	And so he tended to mesh them, in a very similar style that would bring back the audience for
126680	130520	each video, allowing organic views to turn into suggested views, and this would grow
130520	134520	out some great content that had mass appeal to the multitudes of audiences, dedicated
134520	135520	and casual.
135520	139180	Bobby chose this channel probably because it had the best potential fanbase, and as
139180	142980	said, if you tried to mix these views with already established content in a rather distinctly
142980	146060	incompatible style, the algorithms loathe it.
146060	147900	So I believe this was a smart move.
147900	151640	On top of this, he would make some more personal videos that would branch out his character
151640	155720	and the relationship that he had with the audience, in a way he was building an empire.
155720	159580	The Shane brand not just being an interesting expansion of content for him, but also branching
159580	164060	out on the elements of his character, dissecting his childhood, relationships, and asking
164060	166720	a lot of questions with no clear answers.
166720	169520	It's emotionally riveting stuff, it really is.
169520	174220	I feel therefore it was an appropriate succession to continue into these documentary style videos,
174220	177480	that deal with many of the components that Shane had dealt with in the past, just in
177480	182060	a more bombastic fashion, and under the guise of an individual problem or person which is
182060	185960	then branched out to implicitly deal with other questions, that's typically what any
185960	190440	video that's not just a basic reaction video will do, but obviously there are tiers to
190440	192760	this, and Dawson Clear wanted to do top tier.
192760	196860	Now I recently covered the Tea Spilling saga, of which one of the people I covered was Jeffree
196860	197860	Star.
197860	201700	Jeffree Star has been in the public eye for a while, in fact he's a very prominent individual
201700	205420	clearly, however given the sort of brewing tea in that community, it made sense that
205420	209480	Shane would be interested in covering such controversial figures, however in my video
209480	213780	I note that this whole beauty community kind of dominated the summer and pushed other figures
213780	217980	like the Pauls into the background, even though they were arguably behaving much worse than
217980	219940	any of the beauty commentators in question.
220120	223460	So when Shane announced his next set of videos were going to be on Jake Paul, people were
223460	228000	a tad surprised, here is this topic that in a way is kinda dead and buried, and if Shane
228000	231800	was going to pull out his shovel, he was going to have to dig deep to find some interesting
231800	232800	content.
232800	236720	Now there was a natural air of hype surrounding this, following the success of both his previous
236720	240920	series, and this gave it a natural boost, but the first episode was rather low key for
240920	245160	him, and the second one came out, and although no one could deny it was fantastic production
245160	250260	value, there were some critics who felt that what he was discussing was fairly unnecessary.
250260	251260	Why is that?
251260	254380	Well, for a multitude of reasons, but we'll try and break them down, the first one being
254380	258260	that Jake Paul is a dead topic, everyone has an opinion, love him, hate him, and although
258260	261980	Shane can bring the melodrama, which he did without a doubt, we weren't going to be filled
261980	263620	in with any new narratives.
263620	268100	The one that Shane has taken on is whether Jake Paul is a sociopath, which is an interesting
268100	272020	narrative but one he kind of abandoned by the final episode.
272040	276000	Jake Paul definitely displays certain traits of a sociopath, and Dawson cleverly leaves
276000	279680	each part very open ended on that question, at the end of the day we shouldn't be going
279680	283800	around diagnosing someone formally, and that is implicitly assumed, that nothing is being
283800	285360	factually defined here.
285360	289200	However, even with that noted, many people question the point and the implications, at
289200	293200	the end of the day, what Jake Paul does, whether Jake Paul himself is a sociopath or not, is
293200	295600	kind of besides the point, he behaves terribly.
295600	300120	I don't make videos that are out to defend people, in fact I think I criticise more regularly
300120	303780	than most gents, and that gets under some people's skins, and then they get annoyed
303780	307460	and tell me to make original content as if using a topic that exists is somehow unoriginal,
307460	309620	but that's just me being bitchy.
309620	313020	What I found quite interesting this time around was that many approached Shane's series
313020	317420	with a highly critical eye, I think this was in part due to its size, and the ambitions,
317420	321220	I think there are a lot of levels that we can analyse this on, but this time I'm going
321220	325060	to discuss why I believe that the choice of Jake Paul was the correct decision, however
325060	329300	the subsequent handling was a mixed bag, while also attempting to be sympathetic towards
329300	330300	the criticisms.
330300	333840	I think however to understand the weight of the Jake Paul series, you have to understand
333840	336720	Shane first, so that's what I want to do today.
336720	340600	There are a lot of discussions about the original series, so in an attempt to give my video
340600	344900	more of an original spin, I'll be looking at Shane Dawson as much as we look at Jake
344900	348920	Paul, however to understand this we have to take a closer look at Shane's content, and
348920	352800	Shane himself, so without further ado, I suggest we have a little chat.
359320	363480	We've already discussed briefly how Shane Dawson's content really is the goldmine
363480	368360	in many different ways, and in 2018 that has really cemented him as a force to be reckoned
368360	371800	with, but there's a lot more to break down within the content that explores how it's
371800	375760	brought us to this moment, so I'm going to split this part into three separate points,
375760	377960	purpose, tone, and production.
377960	382440	So the first question is, a very broad one, what is the purpose of his content?
382440	386940	What does Shane set out to do when he makes a video, other than to make some sweet dollar?
386940	390520	After all, if the answer was just that, this video would be over a lot sooner, so he does
390520	391920	a fairly tight job of that.
391920	396760	I'd say the most important word that comes to mind is exploration, and this is reflected
396760	401640	within all forms of content, he explores conspiracy theories, he explores haunted mansions, he
401640	402640	explores himself.
402640	406560	The last one is exceptionally important, after all the channel is Shane, a lot of the channels
406560	410800	tend to explore these topics, some are merely structured as list channels, with some anonymous
410800	415160	hosts like Brightside, you know, the channel with that guy who sounds like he smoked some
415160	421860	crack before recording, to be fair a lot of them sound like that.
421860	426900	I assume it's a more focus tested measure, and it works, the clickbait is disgustingly
426900	427900	good.
427900	431460	On the other hand, you have a mix, with someone like Matthew Santoro, who definitely integrates
431460	434980	his personality into his content, but still leaves it secondary.
434980	438700	Shane is a different kind of worm, because his personality is often integrated into his
438700	443300	content as a facet that runs alongside the topic of his video, and there's this mystery
443300	447680	perpetuated around his life, whether it's one of his friends who was sent to prison,
447680	451520	whether it's the relationship between him and his parents, Shane Dawson is an inherently
451520	456360	interesting person, who has built up a persona, and as mentioned in my animators video, we're
456360	460240	arguably in YouTube's most introspective era, people wanted creators who weren't
460240	463800	going to put on a facade, and for someone like Shane this was the perfect time to go
463800	465120	and explore himself.
465120	469060	I think another important point is that these explorations of self were not just limited
469060	473120	to Shane, as I've said before, the art of an endearing on-screen character in this
473120	477040	day and age is that you can take something that is specific to yourself and make other
477040	481160	people feel that, and this is where the tone comes into play, because it is an equally
481160	485540	important element of content creation that you can project a message, or a theme through
485540	487680	a tonally consistent presentation.
487680	491440	Shane covers topics with a lot of sympathy, and always seeks to discover someone else's
491440	495280	perspective, for example, for a long time he had a lot of animosity towards his father,
495280	499540	someone who had caused him a lot of emotional turmoil, in a way he had communicated a lot
499540	501940	of his emotions through that old content.
501940	505980	The new Shane took the established portrait that he had painted of his father, and peeled
505980	510580	it away in arguably one of his most sympathetic videos, it was an attempt to understand the
510580	515220	pain, he often asks a lot of open, general questions, which I think really allows people
515220	519980	to put themselves in his shoes, and it definitely reaches others who may have a similar experience.
519980	525720	I had a problem connecting with you, I felt like you didn't know how to talk to me, or
525720	529800	maybe you would get annoyed with me, or maybe I was too much, or I remember I used to put
529800	533320	towels on my head and pretend like it was a wig, and just like a lot of crazy things
533320	536900	and I felt like maybe, I don't know, I just felt like maybe you didn't get it.
536900	541240	The title of the video is Confronting My Dad, and I think confronting is probably the most
541240	545040	appropriate word, not just the double meaning which makes a pretty damn great clickbait,
545040	548520	but also because that double meaning means he could have taken that confrontation in
548520	552340	a hostile environment, but actually sees it as attempting to resolve an incredibly
552340	554040	difficult situation.
554040	557600	Now we talk a lot about his production, which is obviously very dramatic and will reach
557600	561820	that bridge in a moment, but in my opinion the tone is equally aided by a lot of energy
561820	565560	within the interactions held between the people within these videos.
565560	569060	One video that stood out to me was Shane's video I'm Done, which really might seem
569060	573300	to many just to be a pointless video of Shane going round trying to do things, but being
573300	577660	thwarted at pretty much every turn, it really could have just been a throwaway set of deep
577660	578660	thoughts.
578660	581960	Yet the interaction between Shane, those around him, and particularly the cameraman carries
581960	595400	this unique energy that can honestly make anything interesting, equally as we'll see
595400	599440	in the Jake Paul series, the chemistry that Dawson and the cameraman have is definitely
599440	603960	helped by the production value that often makes situations rather tense, and then cutting
603960	608340	the tension with a joke or a burst of laughter that can often evoke laughter from the audience
608340	623700	too, as when we're nervous we tend to be more prone to such mechanisms.
623700	627300	And this is important because we come to these documentaries and we typically see them as
627300	631860	this picture of other people, Tana Mongeau, Jeffree Star, and they're equally as much
631860	636080	about Shane as they are about the people in the documentaries, and that simple fact
636080	640180	makes these stories all the more compelling because Shane has this presence like very
640180	644980	few other people, and even if as a fan you're not necessarily interested in the subject
644980	649060	of his video, the fact that you have someone like Shane on screen almost taking you personally
649060	652700	through it dissolves that potential boredom that you might feel, so I think a lot of people
652700	656420	tend to give too much credit to the production, because although it's excellent, and once
656420	660040	again we'll delve into the details of that in a moment, you still need something to hold
660040	664120	it down. There have been some movies with fantastic production value, but the characters
664120	669320	are just so shit that no flashy visual is gonna work, so here equally Shane's persona
669320	674340	is important, what about that persona? Well as mentioned I could really switch persona
674340	679320	out for personality, because he wants people to see this as him, the sort of guy next door
679320	682720	who is almost overwhelmed by the way that things have played out and put him in this
682720	686700	position, and I'm not sceptical that this may be the case, and because of this it creates
686700	691380	a connection to the viewer to see someone react in a way that they would in these situations.
691380	695600	I find Shane's content to be attempting to balance formula with individuality, if you
695600	699420	lean too much into the former, you'll come across as inauthentic and end up with that
699420	703960	bright side style content, which although successful right now, will be forgotten, if
703960	708820	you lean too much towards individuality, you'll end up with shapeless videos, so his persona
708820	713340	is an excellent mediator, and with production, well we have to discuss that too because it
713340	717580	has been the attraction of acclaim, and stigma in the past few weeks, we've had countless
717580	721740	videos on YouTube of manipulation in the last year, the sort of stuff that Prince EA does,
721740	725420	you play the emotional music and it gets to people, and suddenly they believe you're
725420	729060	a messiah, but in the last year people have become increasingly aware of that, and although
729060	733060	inspirational speakers are by no means off the platform, I'd say the audience is more
733060	737980	soccer mum suffering a mid-life crisis, people on the commentary side have a more critical
737980	741680	eye, and that means that he has to have a dramatic tone that suits, but doesn't feel
741680	744220	like it's trying to manipulate the framing.
744220	748400	Now we as people have weird standards, we don't mind certain emotions being manipulated,
748400	752400	but we do get annoyed if others are, the one we'd probably like to keep most protected
752400	757340	is that of pity, everyone knows that a sad, emotional YouTuber turning on the camera to
757340	761820	stare at you, take a deep breath, and then let the emotional piano music play.
761820	765900	So with Shane in a way, although we do get a lot of dramatic moments, arguably the best
765900	770080	of his content is when he lets all that production value go, and carries the moment with his
770080	774560	personality, and that's what in a way makes him more endearing than a lot of creators.
774560	778760	On the other hand, we have some ideas of the unknown, mystery, we love them to be blown
778760	783060	out of proportion because it fascinates and stimulates us, and that's what Shane does,
783060	786920	he knows what people are most skeptical of being dramatised and feigned, and grips those
786920	791400	moments with his personality, and then takes what people enjoy and makes the most significant
791400	793280	thing happening in their lives.
793280	797520	We don't like our perception of people manipulated, but when dealing with concepts like conspiracy
797520	799600	theories, we kinda crave it.
799600	803940	Dawson does a good job of making each video a visceral experience, while at the same time
803940	808480	never appearing like he's set on taking advantage of it, finding that balance of person
808480	809800	and production.
809800	812400	Which brings us to his latest venture of content.
819980	823840	So going back to Jake Paul, with all this in mind, people did give Dawson some stick
823840	828460	for his second episode, particularly in how he dramatised the nature of being a sociopath.
828460	832920	You see, this was an interesting concept, as the notion of sociopathy is kinda scary,
832920	837720	is kinda dramatic, is kinda mysterious, is kinda out there, sociopaths may appear to
837720	839120	be a bit threatening.
839120	843000	Shane did what he normally did with these concepts, and played it off in this huge way,
843000	847200	even down to the minor details, like synchronising winks with intense percussion, however in
847200	851840	doing that he also annoyed a few people who felt humanity within the subject.
851840	855880	At the end of the day, whether we like it or not, sociopaths are people, and kinda framing
855880	861000	it to be this awful, world-ending nature, well, some people felt that this was insensitive.
861000	866120	I think in this instance it is a case of separating the sociopathy from the sociopath, and maybe
866120	870140	Shane treated it with a bit too much overlap which rubbed people the wrong way, but I also
870140	873240	think that I understood where he was coming from, and at the end of the day he had to
873240	876560	include some people, because it is an inherently human problem.
876560	880520	The problem is that some people see sociopaths as people suffering from conditions beyond
880520	885080	their control, and attempt to brand the condition in such a way kinda puts Jake Paul's questionable
885080	890500	actions under a shallow explanation, as not every sociopath behaves like Jake Paul.
890500	893660	The whole episode's point was kinda lost because at the end of the day, even though
893660	897960	sociopathy is a serious thing that can cause a threat to those around you, it doesn't
897960	901920	really change the fact that people are individuals, and so what if Jake Paul's a sociopath or
901920	902920	not?
902920	906000	Some actions still shouldn't have been committed regardless of the actor's mental state,
906000	909160	I think many people don't want an explanation, they want action.
909160	912600	But on the other hand, I kinda liked the tone, even though it was more theoretical
912600	913600	than anything else.
913600	917400	I think within the context of Shane's channel, and Shane's journey, it was the right thing
917400	918400	to do.
918400	919400	Why is that?
919400	923680	Well, his first documentary series was about TanaCon, this famous little disaster, and
923680	927240	at the centre of TanaCon was the titular character, Tana Moncho.
927240	931400	Tana is a very curious and polarising character on the platform, many have claimed that she
931400	936040	is disingenuous, and after the whole iDubbb situation, you can kinda see why, and so when
936040	939460	Shane came in from this angle, we all knew that he was going to give it his treatment
939460	941760	of providing it from a sympathetic perspective.
941760	945400	But even with that said, what we got was a series with a very emotional ending, and a
945400	950320	very riveting last episode with an emotional Tana Moncho, and many people were won over
950320	951320	by this.
951320	955760	However, many people also said, well honestly I think Shane was a bit too soft on Tana,
955760	958760	because at the end of the day, regardless of the remorse that she might feel, it still
958760	962800	happened, and she shouldn't just be able to cry her way into a position of sanctity.
962800	966640	So this is how Shane's always been, finding the other person's perspective and hearing
966640	971440	them out, however this is what leads us to the necessity of the Jake Paul series.
971440	974980	Firstly Jake Paul is hated, he has been the recipient of countless amounts of criticism
974980	979560	by commentators, he's insensitive, obnoxious, and frankly rather unlikable, and personality
979560	983120	aside he has been called out for multiple wrongdoings and major mishaps, while frequently
983120	987880	showing little regard or remorse or motivation to reconcile these problems or criticisms.
987880	991600	After all it might just be the formula that made him famous, why would he change it?
991600	995520	Shane's outlook on this situation is ambitious to say the least, but as with anything you
995520	999800	have to raise the stakes or else the audience becomes disinterested.
999800	1003280	Secondly Shane Dawson has gone around, met a lot of people, many of these people who
1003280	1007640	have done very questionable things, yet have come off in the moment as kind, thoughtful,
1007640	1011560	outgoing positive people, and the Jake Paul series represents not just an analysis of
1011560	1016240	Jake Paul, but a double take at all the previous people that he has covered, and he even mentions
1016240	1040580	and shows some of them there.
1040580	1044680	Everything that Shane Dawson has constructed is now being questioned by himself, what if
1044680	1049080	the Empire is a lie, after all sociopaths come in many shapes and sizes, and if one
1049080	1053160	of these people that Shane has covered wasn't actually genuine in how they feel, why would
1053160	1056340	we want to transmit such a message to the audience?
1056340	1061000	What if all of Tana's tears were an act to maintain a subscriber base, if she frames
1061000	1064840	it as an honest mistake, but actually she doesn't really care about the consequences,
1064840	1066320	then should she really be supported?
1066320	1071240	If a tree falls in a forest and no one is there to hear it, did it ever make a sound?
1071240	1073480	Yes, but you wouldn't know that.
1073840	1078160	So when we have that final arc in episode 8, this very sympathetic installment where
1078160	1082840	Jake is arguably at his most vulnerable, emotional, it tugs on the heartstrings, the question
1082840	1086640	still looms of whether this all was a very finely tuned act.
1086640	1090160	Whether this was Shane's intention with the whole sociopath narrative is another question,
1090160	1093960	and the fact that it's barely mentioned in the last couple episodes moves the discussion
1093960	1098000	to the background, but if you keep it in mind, it does still work.
1098000	1102480	And that's the thing, being a sociopath is slightly disjunct from the actions, without
1102480	1106960	a doubt, obviously it's a causal factor, but being a sociopath doesn't predispose
1106960	1110720	you to do something, nor does it mean that you won't do something, but it's definitely
1110720	1116320	a lot more closely tied to the motives, and honestly I'd say, dependent on the actions,
1116320	1120440	sometimes motives are more important to people, even if it's not practical, the problem
1120440	1124720	with people who are fake is not what has happened, it's what could happen.
1124720	1128040	We like to know the people around us, we like to know their intentions, at the end of the
1128040	1132940	day when someone's an unknown capacity, when they may be behaving in a fake manner,
1132940	1133940	what are they gonna do?
1133940	1137120	I want to be able to trust people around me, don't you?
1137120	1142240	You can never have a clear answer on who's what, a sociopath is not necessarily going
1142240	1146400	to admit they are one, and mostly you will have to judge from actions, but Shane's
1146400	1150600	series definitely throws these concepts that we thought we knew up in the air, and I guess
1150600	1155200	it gives us a more in-depth look at working out how to define these individuals, what
1155200	1159280	we've seen is that people are starting to like Jake Paul throughout these episodes,
1159280	1163080	but equally, no matter how likeable he is, we don't know if it's all an excellent
1163080	1167520	act or not, because that's one of the traits of the best sociopaths, he's on camera,
1167520	1171640	of course he's gonna behave in a specific way, if he's a sociopath, our own belief
1171640	1176840	is all we have to judge, and that's the thing, looking at it from just a sociopath
1176840	1181480	basics perspective is pointless, does the fact that he's a sociopath change what he's
1181480	1185080	done and the damage he's inflicted? No, but it could definitely influence how his
1185080	1188980	future mentality is, when approaching these situations, if he doesn't feel remorse
1188980	1193400	for these things and has no drive to do better, then it's hard to support, and no, we'll
1193400	1197360	never be able to tell, but you have to be able to pass judgement on a person, these
1197360	1202000	things aren't provable, a sociopath is a formal term, but we all judge people, and
1202000	1205760	we don't want people who are gonna be frauds and lie in our lives because at the end of
1205760	1209800	the day, whether that's in our control or not, it still has a negative effect on those
1209800	1214960	around them, and we've got enough negativity to deal with already, we can't deny that.
1214960	1220640	However, with all that said, this doesn't mean that he nor the series are above criticism.
1225360	1230200	What can make the series its most appealing is equally what can make the series its weakest,
1230200	1234740	which ultimately comes down to Shane's lack of knowledge on Jake Paul specifically. In
1234740	1238800	one way this is a positive, as the first few episodes take us through the journey without
1238800	1243880	the assumption that the viewer will be as knowledgeable of Jake's antics. This maximises
1243880	1247840	the appeal of the content that he crafts, if you know nothing about Jake, then the series
1247840	1252280	will bring you up to a relatively reasonable pace, but equally the pace is only reasonable,
1252280	1256320	and really if you want to break Jake Paul down, you have to up a few gears.
1256320	1260520	And that's one of Shane's weaknesses, he seems so driven on building a connection
1260520	1264640	to understand the target of a series that he tended to avoid asking the really hard
1264640	1268680	questions, and in a way I understand. He says multiple times during the series that
1268680	1272360	he doesn't want to upset Jake Paul and those around him, but the truth of the matter is
1272360	1275960	that sometimes we need to crack a few eggs to make an omelette, and that doesn't mean
1275960	1280760	being unnecessarily aggressive, but it does mean being assertive and addressing the actual
1280760	1283780	points, where there are many examples where Jake gets off lightly, and there are many
1283780	1287280	videos that cover this, but I'll pick out an example that demonstrates this the most.
1287280	1291120	One of the important points that Shane addresses in his episode with Nick Crompton is that
1291120	1294040	if Jake Paul is caught being dishonest, Shane will just leave.
1294040	1308000	Now this sounds like Shane is taking a hard stance, but the question is, how can you tell
1308000	1312040	when Jake is lying? And the truth is, you can't, and therefore the audience have to
1312040	1317120	be the jurist to an extent on such a presentation, and Shane as the documentarian cannot say
1317120	1321080	with certainty when Jake is lying or not. With that said, Shane can decide the questions
1321080	1325320	to ask, and asking the right questions is a position that comes with significant power,
1325320	1330200	especially in an environment where you could be dictating someone's image on such a platform.
1330200	1333520	One of the narratives that came to the forefront following Nick Crompton's episode was that
1333520	1344200	an extremely high majority of the Team 10 tomfoolery was fake.
1344200	1348400	This as a defence was relatively resolute against the claims being made by former members
1348400	1363160	such as the Martinez Twins, who cited such pranks as reference to Jake's abuse of power.
1363160	1366840	However on the other hand, this did not undermine the criticism that had been presented against
1366840	1370960	him with regards to the involvement of children in the Team 10 house, and Jake's treatment
1370960	1374520	of them, which could be summarised as rather dubious.
1400960	1429680	The
1429680	1433360	problem is that you can't provide a disclaimer to toddlers, they haven't developed a mental
1433360	1437780	stage where they can distinguish between simulated entertainment and reality. Some of the clips
1437780	1441920	shown are incredibly uncomfortable, and show children in legitimate distress, and really
1441920	1446360	do remind me of a more notorious YouTube couple. Although I won't say that he's that bad,
1446360	1449960	it is still something that should be brought up, and I thought they were going to do this
1449960	1454780	when they decide to discuss Nerd City's video which amplified these concerns significantly.
1454780	1458940	Yet despite clearly watching the video, Shane merely brought up the criticism of merchandising
1458940	1463100	to younger children, which is another legitimate point but doesn't encompass the numerous
1463100	1475500	problems that video brought up. On top of that, during that discussion it was quickly
1475500	1480020	diverted to how the messages he spreads towards impressionable children on topics such as
1480020	1484540	education can damage their mentality, which although once again is another point worth
1484540	1488840	considering, it means that we never received a proper answer on the problem of coercive
1488840	1493480	merchandising because they don't have exactly the same implications. That's the thing,
1493480	1497960	in many instances Shane Dawson delivered the most softball form of criticism to Jake, and
1497960	1501600	I believe this was done in the notion of not causing disruption, but I think there were
1501600	1505480	times when the conviction of finding the truth trumped that, because people would deserve
1505480	1509880	an honest portrayal, and by choosing the easiest criticisms it allowed Jake to sidestep a lot
1509880	1514120	of it and come out unscarred. Which is a shame, because really it seemed like Jake was willing
1514120	1518020	to own up to a lot of his misconduct, and with the right wording it may have given him
1518020	1522180	more possibility to reflect on his behaviour, for me it makes the series feel like a missed
1522180	1526340	opportunity in some ways. There's no doubting that there are some strong insights, but equally
1526340	1530740	because Shane is the one asking the questions, his naivety on the topics undermine the true
1530740	1535520	reality of what is going on or what has gone on in the Team 10 house. The lack of knowledge
1535520	1540020	also surfaced when dealing with the situation regarding FaZe Banks, publicised by Jake yet
1540020	1543900	with very little visible evidence. In the sixth episode Jake seemed to dismiss all these
1543900	1548100	claims and then make comments about those, such as Max Beaumont and their behaviour,
1548100	1550220	basically setting everyone else up as liars.
1564220	1568420	This was mildly amended by the eighth episode, but it was still hard to obtain any closure
1568420	1572300	as he kinda just turned it into the ignorance narrative, and with all these arguments being
1572300	1576220	pushed towards him, I feel like Shane then reinforced that narrative by making comments
1576220	1579940	about lack of accountability, and even if this was partially true, it would have been
1579940	1584020	better to let Jake explain it himself, rather than having explanations presented by other
1584020	1586540	people and then him going, yes I agree.
1602300	1611980	And I do admit, the overarching narrative of accountability for actions and being aware
1611980	1616500	for consequences is present, and that can't be taken away, credit where it's due.
1621500	1626100	Naivety however can only explain so much, and I feel if some more hard hitting criticisms
1626100	1630140	have been pushed, we would have seen elaborate explanations that tell us about this character,
1630140	1632940	other than just, well, Jake Paul's an impulsive fool.
1648940	1653140	I don't think Jake Paul's an awful person, I do think there is a legitimately sympathetic
1653140	1657220	take on it, but as someone who is extremely sceptical, these little omissions mean that
1657220	1661060	it's hard to take his responses as a reasonable explanation, and although the mystery is a
1661060	1664740	part of it, mystery should come from desire, not doubt.
1664740	1668620	And this really comes down to Shane and his framing, as said, this series could have equally
1668620	1672380	been about Shane as it is about Jake, and I think it just says that Shane could have
1672380	1676120	really taken that extra step, but his lack of knowledge and lack of confidence in that
1676120	1681300	knowledge subsequently caused a lack of conviction in some harsher criticisms of Mr Paul here.
1681300	1685440	You have to ask the hard questions sometimes, and I'm sure from this, some people felt
1685440	1690920	sold short on the series, myself included, there was more criticism than just my own criticism.
1703920	1709400	As said, I do believe there can be motivations attributed towards the Jake Paul series, however
1709400	1713200	if you're a new viewer to it, or someone who has different priorities in what they
1713200	1716960	think should be the intention, it's very possible that the theme that Dawson crafted
1716960	1718740	isn't one that's going to work for you.
1718740	1723240	You could come out of the second episode thinking, what the hell was the point of that, I mean
1723240	1727560	it's visually exciting and well presented and great and all that entertaining content,
1727560	1730900	what the fuck does it matter whether Jake Paul's a sociopath or not?
1730900	1734840	And Dawson, in spite of what I believe were fair justifications and offences, although
1734840	1739680	as said, I believe the idea of sociopathy was a component of a greater narrative revealed
1739680	1743740	later on, at the time he kinda had no reply, I think there were people who watched the
1743740	1747920	video at the time and just saw this guy asking whether Jake Paul was a sociopath, the whole
1747920	1752720	notion of sociopath encompassing this episode, and I completely understand that, it's clear
1752720	1757000	that he didn't define each feature well enough, it's also clear that he may have rubbed some
1757000	1760520	people the wrong way, although I don't see any problem with dramatising a transcendent
1760520	1764400	condition that stands independently, he may have failed to draw the line clearly enough,
1764400	1765920	and I do agree there.
1765960	1770480	Now, do I think it was worth becoming angry about it like some people did? Of course not,
1770480	1775840	it seemed more like a tonal mishandling rather than actual malice or purposeful insensitivity.
1775840	1779480	One thing you have to accept when making these videos for exceptionally large audiences is
1779480	1783280	that you're going to receive substantial criticism from one side or the other, many
1783280	1786840	of this may just be Jake Paul is irrationally complaining that you're making a video on
1786840	1790520	someone they like, but there will be some legitimate criticisms which is why you have
1790520	1794520	to walk a very thin line, because on one hand if you move too far in one direction you'll
1794520	1798400	risk using a condition as a way to attack a person's character, thus weaponising
1798400	1802520	the condition, and if you move too far in the other way, you risk validating their heinous
1802520	1806520	actions. At the end of the day, someone like Jake Paul may have sociopathic tendencies,
1806520	1810960	but there has to be some level of awareness if he wants to take on the responsibilities
1810960	1815700	of a public figure because his actions have consequences. However, understanding this
1815700	1819520	means that there is a spectrum that this can be on, and if you lean a bit one way or the
1819520	1823680	other it might still be acceptable, because every single element when you create content
1823680	1827740	has a minor effect on which way something might be interpreted, even if it comes down
1827740	1831740	to just feelings that are evoked by people. You have to understand that a true neutral
1831740	1835880	is pretty much impossible, even though we try our goddamn best. With the levels that
1835880	1840320	Dawson is using, not just in his narratives but also in his production and his interaction,
1840320	1843760	and everything we've discussed today, it means that it is exceptionally tough, and
1843760	1847960	the only way to begin to find that neutral point of view is to completely alienate yourself
1847960	1851960	from the situation, and that is something that Dawson cannot afford to do. Equally this
1851960	1855760	means that whichever way you lean, there are going to be people who are quite pedantic
1855760	1859320	who are going to pick up on that. Obviously the less you lean the harder it will be for
1859320	1864080	someone to interpret it that way, but it is inevitability, especially with Shane's expansive
1864080	1867920	audience, and further to this he's under pressure from those around him with how he
1867920	1872520	frames Jake Paul. As said earlier, Shane has a habit of being very friendly and sympathetic
1872520	1876800	towards the subjects of his videos, however, whereas on one hand you have people like Tana
1876800	1881200	who although definitely have their enemies, still have a reasonable reputation, many people
1881200	1885960	believe that the manipulation that Jake was conducting as documented by videos like Nerd
1885960	1891080	Cities giving him almost a quote redemption arc is a step too far, it gives him a sympathetic
1891080	1894920	explanation of this established reputation, to them it's not a case of explanation,
1894920	1900040	it is a case of cancellation, these actions still have impacts. Like Fousey, even though
1900040	1903840	he may have his issues, does it mean it can continue? Then you have a set of people who
1903840	1908200	just feel uncomfortable with you talking on the topic or having opinions on topics because
1908200	1911960	you're seen as this huge influencer, and these fans who watch your videos are too easily
1911960	1916120	coerced by your opinions and then they adopt it themselves, and some people would rather
1916120	1920680	individuals watch just Jake Paul rather than watch someone having opinions on it, and this
1920680	1926160	extends all over it. Now obviously I have various opinions on these individual criticisms,
1926160	1929680	some are well grounded, others not as much, I don't think it's useful to the purpose
1929680	1934640	of the video to provide my individual opinions on each individual critique, the problem is
1934640	1938040	that Shane has attempted to stay neutral, that every time he's veered one way or the
1938040	1942160	other there have been piranhas on either side waiting to have a good nash at his posterior,
1942160	1946120	and even then the interpretive overlap will mean that there will be people who see him
1946120	1950160	as being too harsh on one thing and not harsh enough on another. Now in those instances
1950160	1953880	you can't agree with every single piece of criticism without ending up contradicting
1953880	1958600	yourself to an extent, having an opinion on these things will typically ensue some disagreements
1958600	1962480	with how someone's interpreted it, if we all agreed on the interpretation, chances
1962480	1966640	are the criticism would be pretty uniform, if you want to decide how to respond you need
1966640	1970480	to consider multiple things, how your response is going to make you look, how your response
1970480	1974560	is going to make the original criticism look. I have to be careful, because for every fuck
1974560	1978320	you comment from some 12 year old Jake Pauler you'll have someone else come in with an
1978320	1982540	eloquently worded but nonetheless questionable statement. Now I said I wouldn't respond,
1982540	1986440	but to make an example I find this one rather silly, at the end of the day he shouldn't
1986440	1990520	have to exclude the parents in the discussion of whether they influenced Jake Paul, he wasn't
1990520	1994600	outly accusing anything, nor was he saying that it invalidated the idea that Jake Paul
1994600	1998640	may be a bad person, but to have opinions on these matters is a natural, yet at the
1998640	2002960	same time many people thought these made complete sense because it was based on the assumption
2002960	2007760	that Shane Dawson was outly accusing someone, so he needs to respond in a diplomatic fashion
2007760	2013040	and identify that false premise, and that's where it becomes problematic.
2013040	2017400	Shane Dawson wants to please people, that is a basic analysis I would give of how he
2018000	2022200	Now in my opinion, given the many sensitive topics he's covered and hype provided, this
2022200	2026440	was always going to be his most controversial series, however I think he went into it with
2026440	2031120	a slightly wishful mindset, and the belief that his sympathetic, often impartial framing
2031120	2035160	would offset some of the criticism, and the criticism isn't exactly harsh proportionally
2035160	2039120	for his series, but there was no way he was going to compromise it due to people's differing
2039120	2043720	views on mental health, and how it should be dealt with, you can never eradicate that.
2043720	2047180	However Shane Dawson is a sensitive person, and you could tell that he was really trying
2047180	2051420	to keep up with every single individual criticism of his series, and that's something that
2051420	2055000	when you're Shane Dawson's side you just can't do, you can't just pick out every
2055000	2058900	single criticism and respond to it, because it's going to be on such an extensive spectrum
2058900	2062700	that you just end up burning yourself out. And I'm someone who loves to respond to
2062700	2066660	criticism and debate things about myself, and justify myself, because I want people
2066660	2070900	to know exactly what I mean, and what my intentions are, a discussion with a perception of you
2070900	2075180	that you feel has been misconstrued, and your points have fallen to the wayside, however
2075180	2078620	dealing with all these negative perceptions of you and your content is one of the most
2078620	2082640	draining things ever. One of the many pieces of advice that a large YouTuber will give
2082640	2086780	you is, don't read the comments, I used to read and reply to every single comment because
2086780	2091060	it's good to do if you can, however as you grow to a considerable size you'll realise
2091060	2095000	that dealing with mass amounts of negativity, even when it's well expressed, and having
2095000	2099880	to deal with so many conflicting criticisms, some that will completely contradict themselves,
2099880	2104060	takes a toll on your position. Now I became used to this as I make opinionated content,
2104060	2107700	but I piss people off, that's who I am, I do my best to be polite, but you can't
2107700	2111500	please everyone, and equally I can express myself poorly on the occasion, and if you
2111500	2115340	slip up, they are on you. Now I still look at a few comments, particularly on uploads
2115340	2119140	and often see what's being said in the top, but I know to try not to respond to every
2119140	2124220	single comment. Shane Dawson is doing the equivalent of that on his Twitter, he's
2124220	2127980	being added by swathes of people who have their opinions, and although it's definitely
2127980	2131960	worth paying attention to the criticism, responding to every individual tweet where you're going
2131960	2135480	to end up repeating yourself to a lot of these comments isn't good for you. At the
2135480	2138840	end of the day, you have to get a feel of where the main criticism may lie, try to avoid
2138840	2143440	catering to too many outliers, and then address them at the start of a video or something,
2143440	2147300	and although he did do the latter eventually, he definitely had trouble being dragged back
2147300	2151500	into the fray, which eventually became so stressful he ended up taking a break. You
2151500	2155880	spend a lot of time and work creating something that is exceptionally precious to you, and
2155880	2159400	you see someone challenging exactly what you thought it stood for, and you want to defend
2159400	2163320	that work while simultaneously quieting them down. Confronting them out of the open is
2163320	2167620	often the most direct way to deal with criticism, however equally it can bring about more attention
2167620	2171020	to it, and although criticism shouldn't just be hidden away, responding in such a
2171020	2174240	fashion can do more harm than good to you, even if it's fully debunked.
2174240	2177960	But that's the thing about Shane, you can always tell that he wants the validation and
2177960	2181920	the positive energy from his audience, and that always comes down to an image, whereas
2181920	2185680	on one side you have someone like Jay Pool who has set up such an antagonistic character
2185680	2190200	who is well hated and just plays into it, you have Shane who wants to be this arbiter,
2190200	2194800	this guy who can provide an impartial, sympathetic look at people. So this hits him hard, and
2194800	2199000	this hits even worse because of who Shane is, this person who is really ready to seek
2199000	2203640	the approval of those viewers, and he knows that a slip up could undermine a squeaky clean
2203640	2209600	image, so he goes all out to protect it, responding to countless people. But this mentality and
2209600	2213280	this philosophy can say a lot about Shane himself, and that's where we'll go now.
2215680	2231600	Shane has shown he is someone who has had a lot of difficulty in his life, whether
2231600	2235400	it was bullying, domestic abuse, or weight, I think these are all things that drive many
2235400	2239320	people towards the internet, and when Shane Dawson set up his channel, he probably saw
2239320	2244840	it as an outlet in a way, it is a place for many outcasts, and slowly through interactions
2244840	2249100	you start working out how to really channel whatever creative energy you have into something
2249100	2253240	much better and much more productive. Shane is someone who has had the chance to explore
2253240	2257400	many creative elements of himself, but I really feel this is an automaton for him, and that
2257400	2261820	really what this content represents is an opportunity, an opportunity to search for
2261820	2266000	closure of his issues, and it's one of the things when you have to deal with these problems
2266000	2270400	it is extremely difficult to find that closure. And in a way, you can tell by the attention
2270400	2274040	to detail that Shane pays, especially with his production, that he is a perfectionist,
2274040	2278240	and I think that equally reflects in himself, as simple as it sounds, he wants to work
2278240	2283000	out what is wrong with people, and how to make it right, himself included, it's just
2283000	2286600	where as someone else you can talk to them, and you can give them advice on issues, Shane
2286600	2289680	is the sort of person who has answered a lot of these questions, but knows there are a
2289680	2294080	lot of deeper things within himself that he's not sure how to fully resolve, in a way many
2294080	2297160	of us give the best advice, but we seldom take it.
2297160	2301000	And by looking back at his content, past and present, that's what we see, the one thing
2301000	2305640	that doesn't change is Shane, Shane is a person who audiences can resonate with,
2305640	2310400	he's someone who understands that life is shit sometimes, and when you experience turmoil,
2310400	2314440	there is seldom a one way solution that will make your life just all rosy, because life
2314440	2319200	isn't like that, and I think that these videos represent an expression of that search,
2319200	2323660	a series of existential questions looking for explanations of why someone would behave
2323660	2328160	in the way they do, and equally asking how much control we have over our own instincts
2328160	2329160	and behaviour.
2329160	2333000	With Jake Paul, we see Shane looking into the more troubled minds, not just to understand
2333000	2338840	them, but to understand himself, we're discussing issues like parental influence, personal accountability,
2338840	2343160	mental illness, all these factors being very prevalent in Shane's own life, and he even
2343160	2344160	says it.
2344160	2348840	Shane- Even for me, like why do I want to get so deep with people and talk to people
2348840	2352860	and like try to help them and fix them, why do I want to cry with them, why, like what
2352860	2353860	is that?
2353860	2358780	For him, these not dissimilar factors send us down different paths, maybe Shane sees
2358780	2361260	a bit of himself in everyone.
2361260	2364540	I don't know if Shane's ever gonna find what he's looking for, because it clearly
2364540	2368940	feels like these videos represent a look inside himself, for him to understand why he has
2368940	2373660	these mental struggles, and if he can, how he can rewire it, equally I'd say with the
2373660	2378220	criticism in mind, he's gonna have to ask some harder questions, because even though
2378220	2382580	he may not want to upset others, if he wants to find the truth within himself, he may have
2382580	2386340	to put the questions out there, I can't speak exactly for why he cares so much about
2386340	2390120	the responses and the people and justifying himself, but as someone who feels the same
2390120	2394500	way, a lot of it I'd say comes down to the anxiety of an incorrect interpretation of
2394500	2397260	the message being spread, and the wrong image with you.
2397260	2400740	As a creator being presented, it's just important to remember that it's actually
2400740	2404620	a very small proportion of people who've watched your video who are actually criticising
2404620	2405620	it.
2405620	2409860	That's what I see with regards to Jake Paul, a character study, the search for an explanation,
2409860	2413980	and not just works as an excellent succession and reflection of his previous videos, asking
2413980	2417920	the hard questions about what isn't real, it equally asks about his life, what if the
2417920	2422540	elements he has constructed so finely isn't real, and the empathy and sympathy that he
2422540	2426460	covers with it, gives a universal appeal to audiences that will leave people questioning
2426460	2430360	their friends and families for days, we're witnessing the story of characters who we
2430360	2432940	thought we knew, but are always questioning.
2432940	2437100	So what about the future, the future of his content, the future of Shane Dawson, I think
2437100	2441220	we'll likely see more of these documentaries that investigate human nature in the way that
2441220	2445460	Jake Paul represents, I think that even though it's kind of a dead topic, the overarching
2445460	2449620	nature that he addresses them with always has a timeless appeal, and that is something
2449620	2451420	that is simply undeniable.
2451420	2455580	Maybe this new series won't be on the nose like Jake Paul is, it may deal with it from
2455580	2459980	a more third person perspective like the Jeffree Star series, but it will still be posing these
2459980	2464460	questions to the audiences, and I'm glad he's made the series, as it may help some
2464460	2468820	people understand themselves, and therefore although maybe turning sociopathy into a bit
2468820	2473860	of a dazzling jumped up dramatised talking point, he kinda contradicted the normal humanism
2473860	2478120	and represented a tough compromise between two very constraining elements that he's
2478120	2481620	been trying to balance, and inevitably that attracted some criticism.
2481620	2485220	With regards to Shane, from what I've watched, he'll often put himself in the centre of
2485220	2489160	the documentaries, even though they're on other people, he's arguably just as much
2489160	2493920	the focus as them, and he'll often ask the questions placing himself in those situations
2493920	2495940	and try to work out who he is.
2495940	2499600	Even in his Jake Paul video, which spent a lot of time asking about sociopathy, he would
2499600	2504640	equally ask about himself and his state, and how he would be classed under these prerequisites.
2504640	2512000	I think that is like, when I was a kid, you know, my mom was going through a lot, and
2512000	2518360	I felt like I had to be strong, because she was like, having trouble, so it was always
2518360	2523120	like, oh Shane's my rock, he's my support system, oh he's always strong.
2523120	2524120	So I like-
2524120	2525120	Do that for other people in your life now, too?
2525120	2527120	Are you like a fixer?
2527120	2528120	Yeah.
2528120	2529120	Yeah.
2529120	2530120	Yeah.
2530120	2533600	Because you were like a parentified child, so you've been like an adult since you were
2533600	2534600	whatever age.
2534600	2535600	Yeah.
2535600	2536600	Yeah.
2536600	2542040	And I think, now I'm just at the point where I'm like, I like stay up all night, and I'm
2542040	2544980	just lost, and I'm just like, oh.
2544980	2548280	Which is why I started falling down the holes of like, sociopaths and this and that, because
2548280	2552560	I'm like, what's wrong with me, like, why am I so lost, if I can help all these people
2552560	2555920	why can't I help myself, why am I still depressed, why am I all these things?
2555920	2564080	I look at my channel, and I'm like, oh, the more I'm helping people, the worse I'm getting.
2564080	2568680	My prediction is that these videos, as great as they are, will have to come to an end eventually,
2568680	2572400	and may come to an end with Shane Dawson having built up the character throughout the whole
2572400	2574240	series, finally confronting himself.
2574240	2577960	That would be the most poetic way to conclude this whole saga, at least.
2577960	2581480	I don't think I'll ever be fully able to answer the questions he poses to himself,
2581480	2586360	and implies to us, through this series, because they're ones that no one can ever fully answer,
2586360	2590280	but I hope that he finds some closure, and through that, inspire others to find their
2590280	2591280	own.
2591280	2597800	So yeah, Shane Dawson, net positive, with a few flaws, I think that's fair enough.
2597800	2602080	Alright, I want to give a massive shoutout to the editors, they've done a stellar job,
