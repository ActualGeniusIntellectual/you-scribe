Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with

00:09.360 --> 00:10.360
too much free time.

00:10.360 --> 00:15.360
And boy, don't we have a topic that everyone was anticipating me to cover.

00:15.360 --> 00:17.240
Well looky here, now you get your wish.

00:17.240 --> 00:21.080
I had a few topics to pick out of the hat, but I found such a fascinating one today that

00:21.080 --> 00:25.160
I couldn't possibly ignore it, and it's obviously in part about the titular character,

00:25.160 --> 00:26.560
Mr Shane Dawson here.

00:26.560 --> 00:30.320
Shane Dawson, like a lot of people we talk about on this channel, is a YouTuber, I'm

00:30.320 --> 00:34.000
sure many of you are already aware of this, but if you somehow just discovered this platform

00:34.000 --> 00:37.480
and you've had the pleasure of this beautiful accent introducing you, that's what he is,

00:37.480 --> 00:38.480
a YouTuber.

00:38.480 --> 00:42.280
But he's not just any old YouTuber, he's not a geek off the street, he is one of the first

00:42.280 --> 00:44.580
YouTubers to gain prominence on the platform.

00:44.580 --> 00:48.160
This was mainly through his channel, Shane Dawson TV, the TV there clearly making it

00:48.160 --> 00:49.540
sound nice and professional.

00:49.540 --> 00:53.700
He uploaded these comedy sketch star videos, an iconic classic being Fred is Dead, in which

00:53.700 --> 00:57.500
Shane Dawson appropriately kills Fred so he can establish himself as the most popular

00:57.500 --> 01:00.980
YouTuber on the platform, which you know, I'm not complaining about.

01:00.980 --> 01:05.380
Anyhow that was a simpler time, but as a creator it is necessary that you evolve with the times,

01:05.380 --> 01:08.840
so as charming as these sketches and short films were, it appears that they were brought

01:08.840 --> 01:12.320
to an end on that channel at the close of 2016.

01:12.320 --> 01:13.620
What took its place though?

01:13.620 --> 01:17.820
Well his third channel, Shane, yes he had three channels, busy bloke.

01:17.820 --> 01:21.640
Now Shane was originally set up as a vlog channel, in the day it was almost like a back

01:21.640 --> 01:25.440
up for him letting his followers know what's up and what's going down, with little jokes

01:25.440 --> 01:26.440
and memes.

01:26.440 --> 01:30.200
Nonetheless still with some pretty saucy clickbait, there was no throwaway thumbnail to Shane

01:30.200 --> 01:31.200
it seems.

01:31.200 --> 01:34.440
Anyhow in case you haven't noticed, with the increasing accessibility to high quality

01:34.440 --> 01:38.460
equipment, vlogging has emerged in the past few years as a huge genre, along with this

01:38.460 --> 01:43.720
other genres that crept into the public eye are mystery genres, list genres, and commentary.

01:43.720 --> 01:47.580
Therefore Shane did what any person with a level head would do in those situations, and

01:47.580 --> 01:52.360
made this Shane channel dedicated to morphing all of those genres together, which is pretty

01:52.360 --> 01:53.680
damn genius.

01:53.680 --> 01:57.600
Although as a creator, Shane was definitely aware of the consequences of mixing a range

01:57.600 --> 02:01.720
of genres that are too diverse from each other, and something that his associate Bobby Burns

02:01.720 --> 02:02.720
would soon find out.

02:02.720 --> 02:06.680
And so he tended to mesh them, in a very similar style that would bring back the audience for

02:06.680 --> 02:10.520
each video, allowing organic views to turn into suggested views, and this would grow

02:10.520 --> 02:14.520
out some great content that had mass appeal to the multitudes of audiences, dedicated

02:14.520 --> 02:15.520
and casual.

02:15.520 --> 02:19.180
Bobby chose this channel probably because it had the best potential fanbase, and as

02:19.180 --> 02:22.980
said, if you tried to mix these views with already established content in a rather distinctly

02:22.980 --> 02:26.060
incompatible style, the algorithms loathe it.

02:26.060 --> 02:27.900
So I believe this was a smart move.

02:27.900 --> 02:31.640
On top of this, he would make some more personal videos that would branch out his character

02:31.640 --> 02:35.720
and the relationship that he had with the audience, in a way he was building an empire.

02:35.720 --> 02:39.580
The Shane brand not just being an interesting expansion of content for him, but also branching

02:39.580 --> 02:44.060
out on the elements of his character, dissecting his childhood, relationships, and asking

02:44.060 --> 02:46.720
a lot of questions with no clear answers.

02:46.720 --> 02:49.520
It's emotionally riveting stuff, it really is.

02:49.520 --> 02:54.220
I feel therefore it was an appropriate succession to continue into these documentary style videos,

02:54.220 --> 02:57.480
that deal with many of the components that Shane had dealt with in the past, just in

02:57.480 --> 03:02.060
a more bombastic fashion, and under the guise of an individual problem or person which is

03:02.060 --> 03:05.960
then branched out to implicitly deal with other questions, that's typically what any

03:05.960 --> 03:10.440
video that's not just a basic reaction video will do, but obviously there are tiers to

03:10.440 --> 03:12.760
this, and Dawson Clear wanted to do top tier.

03:12.760 --> 03:16.860
Now I recently covered the Tea Spilling saga, of which one of the people I covered was Jeffree

03:16.860 --> 03:17.860
Star.

03:17.860 --> 03:21.700
Jeffree Star has been in the public eye for a while, in fact he's a very prominent individual

03:21.700 --> 03:25.420
clearly, however given the sort of brewing tea in that community, it made sense that

03:25.420 --> 03:29.480
Shane would be interested in covering such controversial figures, however in my video

03:29.480 --> 03:33.780
I note that this whole beauty community kind of dominated the summer and pushed other figures

03:33.780 --> 03:37.980
like the Pauls into the background, even though they were arguably behaving much worse than

03:37.980 --> 03:39.940
any of the beauty commentators in question.

03:40.120 --> 03:43.460
So when Shane announced his next set of videos were going to be on Jake Paul, people were

03:43.460 --> 03:48.000
a tad surprised, here is this topic that in a way is kinda dead and buried, and if Shane

03:48.000 --> 03:51.800
was going to pull out his shovel, he was going to have to dig deep to find some interesting

03:51.800 --> 03:52.800
content.

03:52.800 --> 03:56.720
Now there was a natural air of hype surrounding this, following the success of both his previous

03:56.720 --> 04:00.920
series, and this gave it a natural boost, but the first episode was rather low key for

04:00.920 --> 04:05.160
him, and the second one came out, and although no one could deny it was fantastic production

04:05.160 --> 04:10.260
value, there were some critics who felt that what he was discussing was fairly unnecessary.

04:10.260 --> 04:11.260
Why is that?

04:11.260 --> 04:14.380
Well, for a multitude of reasons, but we'll try and break them down, the first one being

04:14.380 --> 04:18.260
that Jake Paul is a dead topic, everyone has an opinion, love him, hate him, and although

04:18.260 --> 04:21.980
Shane can bring the melodrama, which he did without a doubt, we weren't going to be filled

04:21.980 --> 04:23.620
in with any new narratives.

04:23.620 --> 04:28.100
The one that Shane has taken on is whether Jake Paul is a sociopath, which is an interesting

04:28.100 --> 04:32.020
narrative but one he kind of abandoned by the final episode.

04:32.040 --> 04:36.000
Jake Paul definitely displays certain traits of a sociopath, and Dawson cleverly leaves

04:36.000 --> 04:39.680
each part very open ended on that question, at the end of the day we shouldn't be going

04:39.680 --> 04:43.800
around diagnosing someone formally, and that is implicitly assumed, that nothing is being

04:43.800 --> 04:45.360
factually defined here.

04:45.360 --> 04:49.200
However, even with that noted, many people question the point and the implications, at

04:49.200 --> 04:53.200
the end of the day, what Jake Paul does, whether Jake Paul himself is a sociopath or not, is

04:53.200 --> 04:55.600
kind of besides the point, he behaves terribly.

04:55.600 --> 05:00.120
I don't make videos that are out to defend people, in fact I think I criticise more regularly

05:00.120 --> 05:03.780
than most gents, and that gets under some people's skins, and then they get annoyed

05:03.780 --> 05:07.460
and tell me to make original content as if using a topic that exists is somehow unoriginal,

05:07.460 --> 05:09.620
but that's just me being bitchy.

05:09.620 --> 05:13.020
What I found quite interesting this time around was that many approached Shane's series

05:13.020 --> 05:17.420
with a highly critical eye, I think this was in part due to its size, and the ambitions,

05:17.420 --> 05:21.220
I think there are a lot of levels that we can analyse this on, but this time I'm going

05:21.220 --> 05:25.060
to discuss why I believe that the choice of Jake Paul was the correct decision, however

05:25.060 --> 05:29.300
the subsequent handling was a mixed bag, while also attempting to be sympathetic towards

05:29.300 --> 05:30.300
the criticisms.

05:30.300 --> 05:33.840
I think however to understand the weight of the Jake Paul series, you have to understand

05:33.840 --> 05:36.720
Shane first, so that's what I want to do today.

05:36.720 --> 05:40.600
There are a lot of discussions about the original series, so in an attempt to give my video

05:40.600 --> 05:44.900
more of an original spin, I'll be looking at Shane Dawson as much as we look at Jake

05:44.900 --> 05:48.920
Paul, however to understand this we have to take a closer look at Shane's content, and

05:48.920 --> 05:52.800
Shane himself, so without further ado, I suggest we have a little chat.

05:59.320 --> 06:03.480
We've already discussed briefly how Shane Dawson's content really is the goldmine

06:03.480 --> 06:08.360
in many different ways, and in 2018 that has really cemented him as a force to be reckoned

06:08.360 --> 06:11.800
with, but there's a lot more to break down within the content that explores how it's

06:11.800 --> 06:15.760
brought us to this moment, so I'm going to split this part into three separate points,

06:15.760 --> 06:17.960
purpose, tone, and production.

06:17.960 --> 06:22.440
So the first question is, a very broad one, what is the purpose of his content?

06:22.440 --> 06:26.940
What does Shane set out to do when he makes a video, other than to make some sweet dollar?

06:26.940 --> 06:30.520
After all, if the answer was just that, this video would be over a lot sooner, so he does

06:30.520 --> 06:31.920
a fairly tight job of that.

06:31.920 --> 06:36.760
I'd say the most important word that comes to mind is exploration, and this is reflected

06:36.760 --> 06:41.640
within all forms of content, he explores conspiracy theories, he explores haunted mansions, he

06:41.640 --> 06:42.640
explores himself.

06:42.640 --> 06:46.560
The last one is exceptionally important, after all the channel is Shane, a lot of the channels

06:46.560 --> 06:50.800
tend to explore these topics, some are merely structured as list channels, with some anonymous

06:50.800 --> 06:55.160
hosts like Brightside, you know, the channel with that guy who sounds like he smoked some

06:55.160 --> 07:01.860
crack before recording, to be fair a lot of them sound like that.

07:01.860 --> 07:06.900
I assume it's a more focus tested measure, and it works, the clickbait is disgustingly

07:06.900 --> 07:07.900
good.

07:07.900 --> 07:11.460
On the other hand, you have a mix, with someone like Matthew Santoro, who definitely integrates

07:11.460 --> 07:14.980
his personality into his content, but still leaves it secondary.

07:14.980 --> 07:18.700
Shane is a different kind of worm, because his personality is often integrated into his

07:18.700 --> 07:23.300
content as a facet that runs alongside the topic of his video, and there's this mystery

07:23.300 --> 07:27.680
perpetuated around his life, whether it's one of his friends who was sent to prison,

07:27.680 --> 07:31.520
whether it's the relationship between him and his parents, Shane Dawson is an inherently

07:31.520 --> 07:36.360
interesting person, who has built up a persona, and as mentioned in my animators video, we're

07:36.360 --> 07:40.240
arguably in YouTube's most introspective era, people wanted creators who weren't

07:40.240 --> 07:43.800
going to put on a facade, and for someone like Shane this was the perfect time to go

07:43.800 --> 07:45.120
and explore himself.

07:45.120 --> 07:49.060
I think another important point is that these explorations of self were not just limited

07:49.060 --> 07:53.120
to Shane, as I've said before, the art of an endearing on-screen character in this

07:53.120 --> 07:57.040
day and age is that you can take something that is specific to yourself and make other

07:57.040 --> 08:01.160
people feel that, and this is where the tone comes into play, because it is an equally

08:01.160 --> 08:05.540
important element of content creation that you can project a message, or a theme through

08:05.540 --> 08:07.680
a tonally consistent presentation.

08:07.680 --> 08:11.440
Shane covers topics with a lot of sympathy, and always seeks to discover someone else's

08:11.440 --> 08:15.280
perspective, for example, for a long time he had a lot of animosity towards his father,

08:15.280 --> 08:19.540
someone who had caused him a lot of emotional turmoil, in a way he had communicated a lot

08:19.540 --> 08:21.940
of his emotions through that old content.

08:21.940 --> 08:25.980
The new Shane took the established portrait that he had painted of his father, and peeled

08:25.980 --> 08:30.580
it away in arguably one of his most sympathetic videos, it was an attempt to understand the

08:30.580 --> 08:35.220
pain, he often asks a lot of open, general questions, which I think really allows people

08:35.220 --> 08:39.980
to put themselves in his shoes, and it definitely reaches others who may have a similar experience.

08:39.980 --> 08:45.720
I had a problem connecting with you, I felt like you didn't know how to talk to me, or

08:45.720 --> 08:49.800
maybe you would get annoyed with me, or maybe I was too much, or I remember I used to put

08:49.800 --> 08:53.320
towels on my head and pretend like it was a wig, and just like a lot of crazy things

08:53.320 --> 08:56.900
and I felt like maybe, I don't know, I just felt like maybe you didn't get it.

08:56.900 --> 09:01.240
The title of the video is Confronting My Dad, and I think confronting is probably the most

09:01.240 --> 09:05.040
appropriate word, not just the double meaning which makes a pretty damn great clickbait,

09:05.040 --> 09:08.520
but also because that double meaning means he could have taken that confrontation in

09:08.520 --> 09:12.340
a hostile environment, but actually sees it as attempting to resolve an incredibly

09:12.340 --> 09:14.040
difficult situation.

09:14.040 --> 09:17.600
Now we talk a lot about his production, which is obviously very dramatic and will reach

09:17.600 --> 09:21.820
that bridge in a moment, but in my opinion the tone is equally aided by a lot of energy

09:21.820 --> 09:25.560
within the interactions held between the people within these videos.

09:25.560 --> 09:29.060
One video that stood out to me was Shane's video I'm Done, which really might seem

09:29.060 --> 09:33.300
to many just to be a pointless video of Shane going round trying to do things, but being

09:33.300 --> 09:37.660
thwarted at pretty much every turn, it really could have just been a throwaway set of deep

09:37.660 --> 09:38.660
thoughts.

09:38.660 --> 09:41.960
Yet the interaction between Shane, those around him, and particularly the cameraman carries

09:41.960 --> 09:55.400
this unique energy that can honestly make anything interesting, equally as we'll see

09:55.400 --> 09:59.440
in the Jake Paul series, the chemistry that Dawson and the cameraman have is definitely

09:59.440 --> 10:03.960
helped by the production value that often makes situations rather tense, and then cutting

10:03.960 --> 10:08.340
the tension with a joke or a burst of laughter that can often evoke laughter from the audience

10:08.340 --> 10:23.700
too, as when we're nervous we tend to be more prone to such mechanisms.

10:23.700 --> 10:27.300
And this is important because we come to these documentaries and we typically see them as

10:27.300 --> 10:31.860
this picture of other people, Tana Mongeau, Jeffree Star, and they're equally as much

10:31.860 --> 10:36.080
about Shane as they are about the people in the documentaries, and that simple fact

10:36.080 --> 10:40.180
makes these stories all the more compelling because Shane has this presence like very

10:40.180 --> 10:44.980
few other people, and even if as a fan you're not necessarily interested in the subject

10:44.980 --> 10:49.060
of his video, the fact that you have someone like Shane on screen almost taking you personally

10:49.060 --> 10:52.700
through it dissolves that potential boredom that you might feel, so I think a lot of people

10:52.700 --> 10:56.420
tend to give too much credit to the production, because although it's excellent, and once

10:56.420 --> 11:00.040
again we'll delve into the details of that in a moment, you still need something to hold

11:00.040 --> 11:04.120
it down. There have been some movies with fantastic production value, but the characters

11:04.120 --> 11:09.320
are just so shit that no flashy visual is gonna work, so here equally Shane's persona

11:09.320 --> 11:14.340
is important, what about that persona? Well as mentioned I could really switch persona

11:14.340 --> 11:19.320
out for personality, because he wants people to see this as him, the sort of guy next door

11:19.320 --> 11:22.720
who is almost overwhelmed by the way that things have played out and put him in this

11:22.720 --> 11:26.700
position, and I'm not sceptical that this may be the case, and because of this it creates

11:26.700 --> 11:31.380
a connection to the viewer to see someone react in a way that they would in these situations.

11:31.380 --> 11:35.600
I find Shane's content to be attempting to balance formula with individuality, if you

11:35.600 --> 11:39.420
lean too much into the former, you'll come across as inauthentic and end up with that

11:39.420 --> 11:43.960
bright side style content, which although successful right now, will be forgotten, if

11:43.960 --> 11:48.820
you lean too much towards individuality, you'll end up with shapeless videos, so his persona

11:48.820 --> 11:53.340
is an excellent mediator, and with production, well we have to discuss that too because it

11:53.340 --> 11:57.580
has been the attraction of acclaim, and stigma in the past few weeks, we've had countless

11:57.580 --> 12:01.740
videos on YouTube of manipulation in the last year, the sort of stuff that Prince EA does,

12:01.740 --> 12:05.420
you play the emotional music and it gets to people, and suddenly they believe you're

12:05.420 --> 12:09.060
a messiah, but in the last year people have become increasingly aware of that, and although

12:09.060 --> 12:13.060
inspirational speakers are by no means off the platform, I'd say the audience is more

12:13.060 --> 12:17.980
soccer mum suffering a mid-life crisis, people on the commentary side have a more critical

12:17.980 --> 12:21.680
eye, and that means that he has to have a dramatic tone that suits, but doesn't feel

12:21.680 --> 12:24.220
like it's trying to manipulate the framing.

12:24.220 --> 12:28.400
Now we as people have weird standards, we don't mind certain emotions being manipulated,

12:28.400 --> 12:32.400
but we do get annoyed if others are, the one we'd probably like to keep most protected

12:32.400 --> 12:37.340
is that of pity, everyone knows that a sad, emotional YouTuber turning on the camera to

12:37.340 --> 12:41.820
stare at you, take a deep breath, and then let the emotional piano music play.

12:41.820 --> 12:45.900
So with Shane in a way, although we do get a lot of dramatic moments, arguably the best

12:45.900 --> 12:50.080
of his content is when he lets all that production value go, and carries the moment with his

12:50.080 --> 12:54.560
personality, and that's what in a way makes him more endearing than a lot of creators.

12:54.560 --> 12:58.760
On the other hand, we have some ideas of the unknown, mystery, we love them to be blown

12:58.760 --> 13:03.060
out of proportion because it fascinates and stimulates us, and that's what Shane does,

13:03.060 --> 13:06.920
he knows what people are most skeptical of being dramatised and feigned, and grips those

13:06.920 --> 13:11.400
moments with his personality, and then takes what people enjoy and makes the most significant

13:11.400 --> 13:13.280
thing happening in their lives.

13:13.280 --> 13:17.520
We don't like our perception of people manipulated, but when dealing with concepts like conspiracy

13:17.520 --> 13:19.600
theories, we kinda crave it.

13:19.600 --> 13:23.940
Dawson does a good job of making each video a visceral experience, while at the same time

13:23.940 --> 13:28.480
never appearing like he's set on taking advantage of it, finding that balance of person

13:28.480 --> 13:29.800
and production.

13:29.800 --> 13:32.400
Which brings us to his latest venture of content.

13:39.980 --> 13:43.840
So going back to Jake Paul, with all this in mind, people did give Dawson some stick

13:43.840 --> 13:48.460
for his second episode, particularly in how he dramatised the nature of being a sociopath.

13:48.460 --> 13:52.920
You see, this was an interesting concept, as the notion of sociopathy is kinda scary,

13:52.920 --> 13:57.720
is kinda dramatic, is kinda mysterious, is kinda out there, sociopaths may appear to

13:57.720 --> 13:59.120
be a bit threatening.

13:59.120 --> 14:03.000
Shane did what he normally did with these concepts, and played it off in this huge way,

14:03.000 --> 14:07.200
even down to the minor details, like synchronising winks with intense percussion, however in

14:07.200 --> 14:11.840
doing that he also annoyed a few people who felt humanity within the subject.

14:11.840 --> 14:15.880
At the end of the day, whether we like it or not, sociopaths are people, and kinda framing

14:15.880 --> 14:21.000
it to be this awful, world-ending nature, well, some people felt that this was insensitive.

14:21.000 --> 14:26.120
I think in this instance it is a case of separating the sociopathy from the sociopath, and maybe

14:26.120 --> 14:30.140
Shane treated it with a bit too much overlap which rubbed people the wrong way, but I also

14:30.140 --> 14:33.240
think that I understood where he was coming from, and at the end of the day he had to

14:33.240 --> 14:36.560
include some people, because it is an inherently human problem.

14:36.560 --> 14:40.520
The problem is that some people see sociopaths as people suffering from conditions beyond

14:40.520 --> 14:45.080
their control, and attempt to brand the condition in such a way kinda puts Jake Paul's questionable

14:45.080 --> 14:50.500
actions under a shallow explanation, as not every sociopath behaves like Jake Paul.

14:50.500 --> 14:53.660
The whole episode's point was kinda lost because at the end of the day, even though

14:53.660 --> 14:57.960
sociopathy is a serious thing that can cause a threat to those around you, it doesn't

14:57.960 --> 15:01.920
really change the fact that people are individuals, and so what if Jake Paul's a sociopath or

15:01.920 --> 15:02.920
not?

15:02.920 --> 15:06.000
Some actions still shouldn't have been committed regardless of the actor's mental state,

15:06.000 --> 15:09.160
I think many people don't want an explanation, they want action.

15:09.160 --> 15:12.600
But on the other hand, I kinda liked the tone, even though it was more theoretical

15:12.600 --> 15:13.600
than anything else.

15:13.600 --> 15:17.400
I think within the context of Shane's channel, and Shane's journey, it was the right thing

15:17.400 --> 15:18.400
to do.

15:18.400 --> 15:19.400
Why is that?

15:19.400 --> 15:23.680
Well, his first documentary series was about TanaCon, this famous little disaster, and

15:23.680 --> 15:27.240
at the centre of TanaCon was the titular character, Tana Moncho.

15:27.240 --> 15:31.400
Tana is a very curious and polarising character on the platform, many have claimed that she

15:31.400 --> 15:36.040
is disingenuous, and after the whole iDubbb situation, you can kinda see why, and so when

15:36.040 --> 15:39.460
Shane came in from this angle, we all knew that he was going to give it his treatment

15:39.460 --> 15:41.760
of providing it from a sympathetic perspective.

15:41.760 --> 15:45.400
But even with that said, what we got was a series with a very emotional ending, and a

15:45.400 --> 15:50.320
very riveting last episode with an emotional Tana Moncho, and many people were won over

15:50.320 --> 15:51.320
by this.

15:51.320 --> 15:55.760
However, many people also said, well honestly I think Shane was a bit too soft on Tana,

15:55.760 --> 15:58.760
because at the end of the day, regardless of the remorse that she might feel, it still

15:58.760 --> 16:02.800
happened, and she shouldn't just be able to cry her way into a position of sanctity.

16:02.800 --> 16:06.640
So this is how Shane's always been, finding the other person's perspective and hearing

16:06.640 --> 16:11.440
them out, however this is what leads us to the necessity of the Jake Paul series.

16:11.440 --> 16:14.980
Firstly Jake Paul is hated, he has been the recipient of countless amounts of criticism

16:14.980 --> 16:19.560
by commentators, he's insensitive, obnoxious, and frankly rather unlikable, and personality

16:19.560 --> 16:23.120
aside he has been called out for multiple wrongdoings and major mishaps, while frequently

16:23.120 --> 16:27.880
showing little regard or remorse or motivation to reconcile these problems or criticisms.

16:27.880 --> 16:31.600
After all it might just be the formula that made him famous, why would he change it?

16:31.600 --> 16:35.520
Shane's outlook on this situation is ambitious to say the least, but as with anything you

16:35.520 --> 16:39.800
have to raise the stakes or else the audience becomes disinterested.

16:39.800 --> 16:43.280
Secondly Shane Dawson has gone around, met a lot of people, many of these people who

16:43.280 --> 16:47.640
have done very questionable things, yet have come off in the moment as kind, thoughtful,

16:47.640 --> 16:51.560
outgoing positive people, and the Jake Paul series represents not just an analysis of

16:51.560 --> 16:56.240
Jake Paul, but a double take at all the previous people that he has covered, and he even mentions

16:56.240 --> 17:20.580
and shows some of them there.

17:20.580 --> 17:24.680
Everything that Shane Dawson has constructed is now being questioned by himself, what if

17:24.680 --> 17:29.080
the Empire is a lie, after all sociopaths come in many shapes and sizes, and if one

17:29.080 --> 17:33.160
of these people that Shane has covered wasn't actually genuine in how they feel, why would

17:33.160 --> 17:36.340
we want to transmit such a message to the audience?

17:36.340 --> 17:41.000
What if all of Tana's tears were an act to maintain a subscriber base, if she frames

17:41.000 --> 17:44.840
it as an honest mistake, but actually she doesn't really care about the consequences,

17:44.840 --> 17:46.320
then should she really be supported?

17:46.320 --> 17:51.240
If a tree falls in a forest and no one is there to hear it, did it ever make a sound?

17:51.240 --> 17:53.480
Yes, but you wouldn't know that.

17:53.840 --> 17:58.160
So when we have that final arc in episode 8, this very sympathetic installment where

17:58.160 --> 18:02.840
Jake is arguably at his most vulnerable, emotional, it tugs on the heartstrings, the question

18:02.840 --> 18:06.640
still looms of whether this all was a very finely tuned act.

18:06.640 --> 18:10.160
Whether this was Shane's intention with the whole sociopath narrative is another question,

18:10.160 --> 18:13.960
and the fact that it's barely mentioned in the last couple episodes moves the discussion

18:13.960 --> 18:18.000
to the background, but if you keep it in mind, it does still work.

18:18.000 --> 18:22.480
And that's the thing, being a sociopath is slightly disjunct from the actions, without

18:22.480 --> 18:26.960
a doubt, obviously it's a causal factor, but being a sociopath doesn't predispose

18:26.960 --> 18:30.720
you to do something, nor does it mean that you won't do something, but it's definitely

18:30.720 --> 18:36.320
a lot more closely tied to the motives, and honestly I'd say, dependent on the actions,

18:36.320 --> 18:40.440
sometimes motives are more important to people, even if it's not practical, the problem

18:40.440 --> 18:44.720
with people who are fake is not what has happened, it's what could happen.

18:44.720 --> 18:48.040
We like to know the people around us, we like to know their intentions, at the end of the

18:48.040 --> 18:52.940
day when someone's an unknown capacity, when they may be behaving in a fake manner,

18:52.940 --> 18:53.940
what are they gonna do?

18:53.940 --> 18:57.120
I want to be able to trust people around me, don't you?

18:57.120 --> 19:02.240
You can never have a clear answer on who's what, a sociopath is not necessarily going

19:02.240 --> 19:06.400
to admit they are one, and mostly you will have to judge from actions, but Shane's

19:06.400 --> 19:10.600
series definitely throws these concepts that we thought we knew up in the air, and I guess

19:10.600 --> 19:15.200
it gives us a more in-depth look at working out how to define these individuals, what

19:15.200 --> 19:19.280
we've seen is that people are starting to like Jake Paul throughout these episodes,

19:19.280 --> 19:23.080
but equally, no matter how likeable he is, we don't know if it's all an excellent

19:23.080 --> 19:27.520
act or not, because that's one of the traits of the best sociopaths, he's on camera,

19:27.520 --> 19:31.640
of course he's gonna behave in a specific way, if he's a sociopath, our own belief

19:31.640 --> 19:36.840
is all we have to judge, and that's the thing, looking at it from just a sociopath

19:36.840 --> 19:41.480
basics perspective is pointless, does the fact that he's a sociopath change what he's

19:41.480 --> 19:45.080
done and the damage he's inflicted? No, but it could definitely influence how his

19:45.080 --> 19:48.980
future mentality is, when approaching these situations, if he doesn't feel remorse

19:48.980 --> 19:53.400
for these things and has no drive to do better, then it's hard to support, and no, we'll

19:53.400 --> 19:57.360
never be able to tell, but you have to be able to pass judgement on a person, these

19:57.360 --> 20:02.000
things aren't provable, a sociopath is a formal term, but we all judge people, and

20:02.000 --> 20:05.760
we don't want people who are gonna be frauds and lie in our lives because at the end of

20:05.760 --> 20:09.800
the day, whether that's in our control or not, it still has a negative effect on those

20:09.800 --> 20:14.960
around them, and we've got enough negativity to deal with already, we can't deny that.

20:14.960 --> 20:20.640
However, with all that said, this doesn't mean that he nor the series are above criticism.

20:25.360 --> 20:30.200
What can make the series its most appealing is equally what can make the series its weakest,

20:30.200 --> 20:34.740
which ultimately comes down to Shane's lack of knowledge on Jake Paul specifically. In

20:34.740 --> 20:38.800
one way this is a positive, as the first few episodes take us through the journey without

20:38.800 --> 20:43.880
the assumption that the viewer will be as knowledgeable of Jake's antics. This maximises

20:43.880 --> 20:47.840
the appeal of the content that he crafts, if you know nothing about Jake, then the series

20:47.840 --> 20:52.280
will bring you up to a relatively reasonable pace, but equally the pace is only reasonable,

20:52.280 --> 20:56.320
and really if you want to break Jake Paul down, you have to up a few gears.

20:56.320 --> 21:00.520
And that's one of Shane's weaknesses, he seems so driven on building a connection

21:00.520 --> 21:04.640
to understand the target of a series that he tended to avoid asking the really hard

21:04.640 --> 21:08.680
questions, and in a way I understand. He says multiple times during the series that

21:08.680 --> 21:12.360
he doesn't want to upset Jake Paul and those around him, but the truth of the matter is

21:12.360 --> 21:15.960
that sometimes we need to crack a few eggs to make an omelette, and that doesn't mean

21:15.960 --> 21:20.760
being unnecessarily aggressive, but it does mean being assertive and addressing the actual

21:20.760 --> 21:23.780
points, where there are many examples where Jake gets off lightly, and there are many

21:23.780 --> 21:27.280
videos that cover this, but I'll pick out an example that demonstrates this the most.

21:27.280 --> 21:31.120
One of the important points that Shane addresses in his episode with Nick Crompton is that

21:31.120 --> 21:34.040
if Jake Paul is caught being dishonest, Shane will just leave.

21:34.040 --> 21:48.000
Now this sounds like Shane is taking a hard stance, but the question is, how can you tell

21:48.000 --> 21:52.040
when Jake is lying? And the truth is, you can't, and therefore the audience have to

21:52.040 --> 21:57.120
be the jurist to an extent on such a presentation, and Shane as the documentarian cannot say

21:57.120 --> 22:01.080
with certainty when Jake is lying or not. With that said, Shane can decide the questions

22:01.080 --> 22:05.320
to ask, and asking the right questions is a position that comes with significant power,

22:05.320 --> 22:10.200
especially in an environment where you could be dictating someone's image on such a platform.

22:10.200 --> 22:13.520
One of the narratives that came to the forefront following Nick Crompton's episode was that

22:13.520 --> 22:24.200
an extremely high majority of the Team 10 tomfoolery was fake.

22:24.200 --> 22:28.400
This as a defence was relatively resolute against the claims being made by former members

22:28.400 --> 22:43.160
such as the Martinez Twins, who cited such pranks as reference to Jake's abuse of power.

22:43.160 --> 22:46.840
However on the other hand, this did not undermine the criticism that had been presented against

22:46.840 --> 22:50.960
him with regards to the involvement of children in the Team 10 house, and Jake's treatment

22:50.960 --> 22:54.520
of them, which could be summarised as rather dubious.

23:20.960 --> 23:49.680
The

23:49.680 --> 23:53.360
problem is that you can't provide a disclaimer to toddlers, they haven't developed a mental

23:53.360 --> 23:57.780
stage where they can distinguish between simulated entertainment and reality. Some of the clips

23:57.780 --> 24:01.920
shown are incredibly uncomfortable, and show children in legitimate distress, and really

24:01.920 --> 24:06.360
do remind me of a more notorious YouTube couple. Although I won't say that he's that bad,

24:06.360 --> 24:09.960
it is still something that should be brought up, and I thought they were going to do this

24:09.960 --> 24:14.780
when they decide to discuss Nerd City's video which amplified these concerns significantly.

24:14.780 --> 24:18.940
Yet despite clearly watching the video, Shane merely brought up the criticism of merchandising

24:18.940 --> 24:23.100
to younger children, which is another legitimate point but doesn't encompass the numerous

24:23.100 --> 24:35.500
problems that video brought up. On top of that, during that discussion it was quickly

24:35.500 --> 24:40.020
diverted to how the messages he spreads towards impressionable children on topics such as

24:40.020 --> 24:44.540
education can damage their mentality, which although once again is another point worth

24:44.540 --> 24:48.840
considering, it means that we never received a proper answer on the problem of coercive

24:48.840 --> 24:53.480
merchandising because they don't have exactly the same implications. That's the thing,

24:53.480 --> 24:57.960
in many instances Shane Dawson delivered the most softball form of criticism to Jake, and

24:57.960 --> 25:01.600
I believe this was done in the notion of not causing disruption, but I think there were

25:01.600 --> 25:05.480
times when the conviction of finding the truth trumped that, because people would deserve

25:05.480 --> 25:09.880
an honest portrayal, and by choosing the easiest criticisms it allowed Jake to sidestep a lot

25:09.880 --> 25:14.120
of it and come out unscarred. Which is a shame, because really it seemed like Jake was willing

25:14.120 --> 25:18.020
to own up to a lot of his misconduct, and with the right wording it may have given him

25:18.020 --> 25:22.180
more possibility to reflect on his behaviour, for me it makes the series feel like a missed

25:22.180 --> 25:26.340
opportunity in some ways. There's no doubting that there are some strong insights, but equally

25:26.340 --> 25:30.740
because Shane is the one asking the questions, his naivety on the topics undermine the true

25:30.740 --> 25:35.520
reality of what is going on or what has gone on in the Team 10 house. The lack of knowledge

25:35.520 --> 25:40.020
also surfaced when dealing with the situation regarding FaZe Banks, publicised by Jake yet

25:40.020 --> 25:43.900
with very little visible evidence. In the sixth episode Jake seemed to dismiss all these

25:43.900 --> 25:48.100
claims and then make comments about those, such as Max Beaumont and their behaviour,

25:48.100 --> 25:50.220
basically setting everyone else up as liars.

26:04.220 --> 26:08.420
This was mildly amended by the eighth episode, but it was still hard to obtain any closure

26:08.420 --> 26:12.300
as he kinda just turned it into the ignorance narrative, and with all these arguments being

26:12.300 --> 26:16.220
pushed towards him, I feel like Shane then reinforced that narrative by making comments

26:16.220 --> 26:19.940
about lack of accountability, and even if this was partially true, it would have been

26:19.940 --> 26:24.020
better to let Jake explain it himself, rather than having explanations presented by other

26:24.020 --> 26:26.540
people and then him going, yes I agree.

26:42.300 --> 26:51.980
And I do admit, the overarching narrative of accountability for actions and being aware

26:51.980 --> 26:56.500
for consequences is present, and that can't be taken away, credit where it's due.

27:01.500 --> 27:06.100
Naivety however can only explain so much, and I feel if some more hard hitting criticisms

27:06.100 --> 27:10.140
have been pushed, we would have seen elaborate explanations that tell us about this character,

27:10.140 --> 27:12.940
other than just, well, Jake Paul's an impulsive fool.

27:28.940 --> 27:33.140
I don't think Jake Paul's an awful person, I do think there is a legitimately sympathetic

27:33.140 --> 27:37.220
take on it, but as someone who is extremely sceptical, these little omissions mean that

27:37.220 --> 27:41.060
it's hard to take his responses as a reasonable explanation, and although the mystery is a

27:41.060 --> 27:44.740
part of it, mystery should come from desire, not doubt.

27:44.740 --> 27:48.620
And this really comes down to Shane and his framing, as said, this series could have equally

27:48.620 --> 27:52.380
been about Shane as it is about Jake, and I think it just says that Shane could have

27:52.380 --> 27:56.120
really taken that extra step, but his lack of knowledge and lack of confidence in that

27:56.120 --> 28:01.300
knowledge subsequently caused a lack of conviction in some harsher criticisms of Mr Paul here.

28:01.300 --> 28:05.440
You have to ask the hard questions sometimes, and I'm sure from this, some people felt

28:05.440 --> 28:10.920
sold short on the series, myself included, there was more criticism than just my own criticism.

28:23.920 --> 28:29.400
As said, I do believe there can be motivations attributed towards the Jake Paul series, however

28:29.400 --> 28:33.200
if you're a new viewer to it, or someone who has different priorities in what they

28:33.200 --> 28:36.960
think should be the intention, it's very possible that the theme that Dawson crafted

28:36.960 --> 28:38.740
isn't one that's going to work for you.

28:38.740 --> 28:43.240
You could come out of the second episode thinking, what the hell was the point of that, I mean

28:43.240 --> 28:47.560
it's visually exciting and well presented and great and all that entertaining content,

28:47.560 --> 28:50.900
what the fuck does it matter whether Jake Paul's a sociopath or not?

28:50.900 --> 28:54.840
And Dawson, in spite of what I believe were fair justifications and offences, although

28:54.840 --> 28:59.680
as said, I believe the idea of sociopathy was a component of a greater narrative revealed

28:59.680 --> 29:03.740
later on, at the time he kinda had no reply, I think there were people who watched the

29:03.740 --> 29:07.920
video at the time and just saw this guy asking whether Jake Paul was a sociopath, the whole

29:07.920 --> 29:12.720
notion of sociopath encompassing this episode, and I completely understand that, it's clear

29:12.720 --> 29:17.000
that he didn't define each feature well enough, it's also clear that he may have rubbed some

29:17.000 --> 29:20.520
people the wrong way, although I don't see any problem with dramatising a transcendent

29:20.520 --> 29:24.400
condition that stands independently, he may have failed to draw the line clearly enough,

29:24.400 --> 29:25.920
and I do agree there.

29:25.960 --> 29:30.480
Now, do I think it was worth becoming angry about it like some people did? Of course not,

29:30.480 --> 29:35.840
it seemed more like a tonal mishandling rather than actual malice or purposeful insensitivity.

29:35.840 --> 29:39.480
One thing you have to accept when making these videos for exceptionally large audiences is

29:39.480 --> 29:43.280
that you're going to receive substantial criticism from one side or the other, many

29:43.280 --> 29:46.840
of this may just be Jake Paul is irrationally complaining that you're making a video on

29:46.840 --> 29:50.520
someone they like, but there will be some legitimate criticisms which is why you have

29:50.520 --> 29:54.520
to walk a very thin line, because on one hand if you move too far in one direction you'll

29:54.520 --> 29:58.400
risk using a condition as a way to attack a person's character, thus weaponising

29:58.400 --> 30:02.520
the condition, and if you move too far in the other way, you risk validating their heinous

30:02.520 --> 30:06.520
actions. At the end of the day, someone like Jake Paul may have sociopathic tendencies,

30:06.520 --> 30:10.960
but there has to be some level of awareness if he wants to take on the responsibilities

30:10.960 --> 30:15.700
of a public figure because his actions have consequences. However, understanding this

30:15.700 --> 30:19.520
means that there is a spectrum that this can be on, and if you lean a bit one way or the

30:19.520 --> 30:23.680
other it might still be acceptable, because every single element when you create content

30:23.680 --> 30:27.740
has a minor effect on which way something might be interpreted, even if it comes down

30:27.740 --> 30:31.740
to just feelings that are evoked by people. You have to understand that a true neutral

30:31.740 --> 30:35.880
is pretty much impossible, even though we try our goddamn best. With the levels that

30:35.880 --> 30:40.320
Dawson is using, not just in his narratives but also in his production and his interaction,

30:40.320 --> 30:43.760
and everything we've discussed today, it means that it is exceptionally tough, and

30:43.760 --> 30:47.960
the only way to begin to find that neutral point of view is to completely alienate yourself

30:47.960 --> 30:51.960
from the situation, and that is something that Dawson cannot afford to do. Equally this

30:51.960 --> 30:55.760
means that whichever way you lean, there are going to be people who are quite pedantic

30:55.760 --> 30:59.320
who are going to pick up on that. Obviously the less you lean the harder it will be for

30:59.320 --> 31:04.080
someone to interpret it that way, but it is inevitability, especially with Shane's expansive

31:04.080 --> 31:07.920
audience, and further to this he's under pressure from those around him with how he

31:07.920 --> 31:12.520
frames Jake Paul. As said earlier, Shane has a habit of being very friendly and sympathetic

31:12.520 --> 31:16.800
towards the subjects of his videos, however, whereas on one hand you have people like Tana

31:16.800 --> 31:21.200
who although definitely have their enemies, still have a reasonable reputation, many people

31:21.200 --> 31:25.960
believe that the manipulation that Jake was conducting as documented by videos like Nerd

31:25.960 --> 31:31.080
Cities giving him almost a quote redemption arc is a step too far, it gives him a sympathetic

31:31.080 --> 31:34.920
explanation of this established reputation, to them it's not a case of explanation,

31:34.920 --> 31:40.040
it is a case of cancellation, these actions still have impacts. Like Fousey, even though

31:40.040 --> 31:43.840
he may have his issues, does it mean it can continue? Then you have a set of people who

31:43.840 --> 31:48.200
just feel uncomfortable with you talking on the topic or having opinions on topics because

31:48.200 --> 31:51.960
you're seen as this huge influencer, and these fans who watch your videos are too easily

31:51.960 --> 31:56.120
coerced by your opinions and then they adopt it themselves, and some people would rather

31:56.120 --> 32:00.680
individuals watch just Jake Paul rather than watch someone having opinions on it, and this

32:00.680 --> 32:06.160
extends all over it. Now obviously I have various opinions on these individual criticisms,

32:06.160 --> 32:09.680
some are well grounded, others not as much, I don't think it's useful to the purpose

32:09.680 --> 32:14.640
of the video to provide my individual opinions on each individual critique, the problem is

32:14.640 --> 32:18.040
that Shane has attempted to stay neutral, that every time he's veered one way or the

32:18.040 --> 32:22.160
other there have been piranhas on either side waiting to have a good nash at his posterior,

32:22.160 --> 32:26.120
and even then the interpretive overlap will mean that there will be people who see him

32:26.120 --> 32:30.160
as being too harsh on one thing and not harsh enough on another. Now in those instances

32:30.160 --> 32:33.880
you can't agree with every single piece of criticism without ending up contradicting

32:33.880 --> 32:38.600
yourself to an extent, having an opinion on these things will typically ensue some disagreements

32:38.600 --> 32:42.480
with how someone's interpreted it, if we all agreed on the interpretation, chances

32:42.480 --> 32:46.640
are the criticism would be pretty uniform, if you want to decide how to respond you need

32:46.640 --> 32:50.480
to consider multiple things, how your response is going to make you look, how your response

32:50.480 --> 32:54.560
is going to make the original criticism look. I have to be careful, because for every fuck

32:54.560 --> 32:58.320
you comment from some 12 year old Jake Pauler you'll have someone else come in with an

32:58.320 --> 33:02.540
eloquently worded but nonetheless questionable statement. Now I said I wouldn't respond,

33:02.540 --> 33:06.440
but to make an example I find this one rather silly, at the end of the day he shouldn't

33:06.440 --> 33:10.520
have to exclude the parents in the discussion of whether they influenced Jake Paul, he wasn't

33:10.520 --> 33:14.600
outly accusing anything, nor was he saying that it invalidated the idea that Jake Paul

33:14.600 --> 33:18.640
may be a bad person, but to have opinions on these matters is a natural, yet at the

33:18.640 --> 33:22.960
same time many people thought these made complete sense because it was based on the assumption

33:22.960 --> 33:27.760
that Shane Dawson was outly accusing someone, so he needs to respond in a diplomatic fashion

33:27.760 --> 33:33.040
and identify that false premise, and that's where it becomes problematic.

33:33.040 --> 33:37.400
Shane Dawson wants to please people, that is a basic analysis I would give of how he

33:38.000 --> 33:42.200
Now in my opinion, given the many sensitive topics he's covered and hype provided, this

33:42.200 --> 33:46.440
was always going to be his most controversial series, however I think he went into it with

33:46.440 --> 33:51.120
a slightly wishful mindset, and the belief that his sympathetic, often impartial framing

33:51.120 --> 33:55.160
would offset some of the criticism, and the criticism isn't exactly harsh proportionally

33:55.160 --> 33:59.120
for his series, but there was no way he was going to compromise it due to people's differing

33:59.120 --> 34:03.720
views on mental health, and how it should be dealt with, you can never eradicate that.

34:03.720 --> 34:07.180
However Shane Dawson is a sensitive person, and you could tell that he was really trying

34:07.180 --> 34:11.420
to keep up with every single individual criticism of his series, and that's something that

34:11.420 --> 34:15.000
when you're Shane Dawson's side you just can't do, you can't just pick out every

34:15.000 --> 34:18.900
single criticism and respond to it, because it's going to be on such an extensive spectrum

34:18.900 --> 34:22.700
that you just end up burning yourself out. And I'm someone who loves to respond to

34:22.700 --> 34:26.660
criticism and debate things about myself, and justify myself, because I want people

34:26.660 --> 34:30.900
to know exactly what I mean, and what my intentions are, a discussion with a perception of you

34:30.900 --> 34:35.180
that you feel has been misconstrued, and your points have fallen to the wayside, however

34:35.180 --> 34:38.620
dealing with all these negative perceptions of you and your content is one of the most

34:38.620 --> 34:42.640
draining things ever. One of the many pieces of advice that a large YouTuber will give

34:42.640 --> 34:46.780
you is, don't read the comments, I used to read and reply to every single comment because

34:46.780 --> 34:51.060
it's good to do if you can, however as you grow to a considerable size you'll realise

34:51.060 --> 34:55.000
that dealing with mass amounts of negativity, even when it's well expressed, and having

34:55.000 --> 34:59.880
to deal with so many conflicting criticisms, some that will completely contradict themselves,

34:59.880 --> 35:04.060
takes a toll on your position. Now I became used to this as I make opinionated content,

35:04.060 --> 35:07.700
but I piss people off, that's who I am, I do my best to be polite, but you can't

35:07.700 --> 35:11.500
please everyone, and equally I can express myself poorly on the occasion, and if you

35:11.500 --> 35:15.340
slip up, they are on you. Now I still look at a few comments, particularly on uploads

35:15.340 --> 35:19.140
and often see what's being said in the top, but I know to try not to respond to every

35:19.140 --> 35:24.220
single comment. Shane Dawson is doing the equivalent of that on his Twitter, he's

35:24.220 --> 35:27.980
being added by swathes of people who have their opinions, and although it's definitely

35:27.980 --> 35:31.960
worth paying attention to the criticism, responding to every individual tweet where you're going

35:31.960 --> 35:35.480
to end up repeating yourself to a lot of these comments isn't good for you. At the

35:35.480 --> 35:38.840
end of the day, you have to get a feel of where the main criticism may lie, try to avoid

35:38.840 --> 35:43.440
catering to too many outliers, and then address them at the start of a video or something,

35:43.440 --> 35:47.300
and although he did do the latter eventually, he definitely had trouble being dragged back

35:47.300 --> 35:51.500
into the fray, which eventually became so stressful he ended up taking a break. You

35:51.500 --> 35:55.880
spend a lot of time and work creating something that is exceptionally precious to you, and

35:55.880 --> 35:59.400
you see someone challenging exactly what you thought it stood for, and you want to defend

35:59.400 --> 36:03.320
that work while simultaneously quieting them down. Confronting them out of the open is

36:03.320 --> 36:07.620
often the most direct way to deal with criticism, however equally it can bring about more attention

36:07.620 --> 36:11.020
to it, and although criticism shouldn't just be hidden away, responding in such a

36:11.020 --> 36:14.240
fashion can do more harm than good to you, even if it's fully debunked.

36:14.240 --> 36:17.960
But that's the thing about Shane, you can always tell that he wants the validation and

36:17.960 --> 36:21.920
the positive energy from his audience, and that always comes down to an image, whereas

36:21.920 --> 36:25.680
on one side you have someone like Jay Pool who has set up such an antagonistic character

36:25.680 --> 36:30.200
who is well hated and just plays into it, you have Shane who wants to be this arbiter,

36:30.200 --> 36:34.800
this guy who can provide an impartial, sympathetic look at people. So this hits him hard, and

36:34.800 --> 36:39.000
this hits even worse because of who Shane is, this person who is really ready to seek

36:39.000 --> 36:43.640
the approval of those viewers, and he knows that a slip up could undermine a squeaky clean

36:43.640 --> 36:49.600
image, so he goes all out to protect it, responding to countless people. But this mentality and

36:49.600 --> 36:53.280
this philosophy can say a lot about Shane himself, and that's where we'll go now.

36:55.680 --> 37:11.600
Shane has shown he is someone who has had a lot of difficulty in his life, whether

37:11.600 --> 37:15.400
it was bullying, domestic abuse, or weight, I think these are all things that drive many

37:15.400 --> 37:19.320
people towards the internet, and when Shane Dawson set up his channel, he probably saw

37:19.320 --> 37:24.840
it as an outlet in a way, it is a place for many outcasts, and slowly through interactions

37:24.840 --> 37:29.100
you start working out how to really channel whatever creative energy you have into something

37:29.100 --> 37:33.240
much better and much more productive. Shane is someone who has had the chance to explore

37:33.240 --> 37:37.400
many creative elements of himself, but I really feel this is an automaton for him, and that

37:37.400 --> 37:41.820
really what this content represents is an opportunity, an opportunity to search for

37:41.820 --> 37:46.000
closure of his issues, and it's one of the things when you have to deal with these problems

37:46.000 --> 37:50.400
it is extremely difficult to find that closure. And in a way, you can tell by the attention

37:50.400 --> 37:54.040
to detail that Shane pays, especially with his production, that he is a perfectionist,

37:54.040 --> 37:58.240
and I think that equally reflects in himself, as simple as it sounds, he wants to work

37:58.240 --> 38:03.000
out what is wrong with people, and how to make it right, himself included, it's just

38:03.000 --> 38:06.600
where as someone else you can talk to them, and you can give them advice on issues, Shane

38:06.600 --> 38:09.680
is the sort of person who has answered a lot of these questions, but knows there are a

38:09.680 --> 38:14.080
lot of deeper things within himself that he's not sure how to fully resolve, in a way many

38:14.080 --> 38:17.160
of us give the best advice, but we seldom take it.

38:17.160 --> 38:21.000
And by looking back at his content, past and present, that's what we see, the one thing

38:21.000 --> 38:25.640
that doesn't change is Shane, Shane is a person who audiences can resonate with,

38:25.640 --> 38:30.400
he's someone who understands that life is shit sometimes, and when you experience turmoil,

38:30.400 --> 38:34.440
there is seldom a one way solution that will make your life just all rosy, because life

38:34.440 --> 38:39.200
isn't like that, and I think that these videos represent an expression of that search,

38:39.200 --> 38:43.660
a series of existential questions looking for explanations of why someone would behave

38:43.660 --> 38:48.160
in the way they do, and equally asking how much control we have over our own instincts

38:48.160 --> 38:49.160
and behaviour.

38:49.160 --> 38:53.000
With Jake Paul, we see Shane looking into the more troubled minds, not just to understand

38:53.000 --> 38:58.840
them, but to understand himself, we're discussing issues like parental influence, personal accountability,

38:58.840 --> 39:03.160
mental illness, all these factors being very prevalent in Shane's own life, and he even

39:03.160 --> 39:04.160
says it.

39:04.160 --> 39:08.840
Shane- Even for me, like why do I want to get so deep with people and talk to people

39:08.840 --> 39:12.860
and like try to help them and fix them, why do I want to cry with them, why, like what

39:12.860 --> 39:13.860
is that?

39:13.860 --> 39:18.780
For him, these not dissimilar factors send us down different paths, maybe Shane sees

39:18.780 --> 39:21.260
a bit of himself in everyone.

39:21.260 --> 39:24.540
I don't know if Shane's ever gonna find what he's looking for, because it clearly

39:24.540 --> 39:28.940
feels like these videos represent a look inside himself, for him to understand why he has

39:28.940 --> 39:33.660
these mental struggles, and if he can, how he can rewire it, equally I'd say with the

39:33.660 --> 39:38.220
criticism in mind, he's gonna have to ask some harder questions, because even though

39:38.220 --> 39:42.580
he may not want to upset others, if he wants to find the truth within himself, he may have

39:42.580 --> 39:46.340
to put the questions out there, I can't speak exactly for why he cares so much about

39:46.340 --> 39:50.120
the responses and the people and justifying himself, but as someone who feels the same

39:50.120 --> 39:54.500
way, a lot of it I'd say comes down to the anxiety of an incorrect interpretation of

39:54.500 --> 39:57.260
the message being spread, and the wrong image with you.

39:57.260 --> 40:00.740
As a creator being presented, it's just important to remember that it's actually

40:00.740 --> 40:04.620
a very small proportion of people who've watched your video who are actually criticising

40:04.620 --> 40:05.620
it.

40:05.620 --> 40:09.860
That's what I see with regards to Jake Paul, a character study, the search for an explanation,

40:09.860 --> 40:13.980
and not just works as an excellent succession and reflection of his previous videos, asking

40:13.980 --> 40:17.920
the hard questions about what isn't real, it equally asks about his life, what if the

40:17.920 --> 40:22.540
elements he has constructed so finely isn't real, and the empathy and sympathy that he

40:22.540 --> 40:26.460
covers with it, gives a universal appeal to audiences that will leave people questioning

40:26.460 --> 40:30.360
their friends and families for days, we're witnessing the story of characters who we

40:30.360 --> 40:32.940
thought we knew, but are always questioning.

40:32.940 --> 40:37.100
So what about the future, the future of his content, the future of Shane Dawson, I think

40:37.100 --> 40:41.220
we'll likely see more of these documentaries that investigate human nature in the way that

40:41.220 --> 40:45.460
Jake Paul represents, I think that even though it's kind of a dead topic, the overarching

40:45.460 --> 40:49.620
nature that he addresses them with always has a timeless appeal, and that is something

40:49.620 --> 40:51.420
that is simply undeniable.

40:51.420 --> 40:55.580
Maybe this new series won't be on the nose like Jake Paul is, it may deal with it from

40:55.580 --> 40:59.980
a more third person perspective like the Jeffree Star series, but it will still be posing these

40:59.980 --> 41:04.460
questions to the audiences, and I'm glad he's made the series, as it may help some

41:04.460 --> 41:08.820
people understand themselves, and therefore although maybe turning sociopathy into a bit

41:08.820 --> 41:13.860
of a dazzling jumped up dramatised talking point, he kinda contradicted the normal humanism

41:13.860 --> 41:18.120
and represented a tough compromise between two very constraining elements that he's

41:18.120 --> 41:21.620
been trying to balance, and inevitably that attracted some criticism.

41:21.620 --> 41:25.220
With regards to Shane, from what I've watched, he'll often put himself in the centre of

41:25.220 --> 41:29.160
the documentaries, even though they're on other people, he's arguably just as much

41:29.160 --> 41:33.920
the focus as them, and he'll often ask the questions placing himself in those situations

41:33.920 --> 41:35.940
and try to work out who he is.

41:35.940 --> 41:39.600
Even in his Jake Paul video, which spent a lot of time asking about sociopathy, he would

41:39.600 --> 41:44.640
equally ask about himself and his state, and how he would be classed under these prerequisites.

41:44.640 --> 41:52.000
I think that is like, when I was a kid, you know, my mom was going through a lot, and

41:52.000 --> 41:58.360
I felt like I had to be strong, because she was like, having trouble, so it was always

41:58.360 --> 42:03.120
like, oh Shane's my rock, he's my support system, oh he's always strong.

42:03.120 --> 42:04.120
So I like-

42:04.120 --> 42:05.120
Do that for other people in your life now, too?

42:05.120 --> 42:07.120
Are you like a fixer?

42:07.120 --> 42:08.120
Yeah.

42:08.120 --> 42:09.120
Yeah.

42:09.120 --> 42:10.120
Yeah.

42:10.120 --> 42:13.600
Because you were like a parentified child, so you've been like an adult since you were

42:13.600 --> 42:14.600
whatever age.

42:14.600 --> 42:15.600
Yeah.

42:15.600 --> 42:16.600
Yeah.

42:16.600 --> 42:22.040
And I think, now I'm just at the point where I'm like, I like stay up all night, and I'm

42:22.040 --> 42:24.980
just lost, and I'm just like, oh.

42:24.980 --> 42:28.280
Which is why I started falling down the holes of like, sociopaths and this and that, because

42:28.280 --> 42:32.560
I'm like, what's wrong with me, like, why am I so lost, if I can help all these people

42:32.560 --> 42:35.920
why can't I help myself, why am I still depressed, why am I all these things?

42:35.920 --> 42:44.080
I look at my channel, and I'm like, oh, the more I'm helping people, the worse I'm getting.

42:44.080 --> 42:48.680
My prediction is that these videos, as great as they are, will have to come to an end eventually,

42:48.680 --> 42:52.400
and may come to an end with Shane Dawson having built up the character throughout the whole

42:52.400 --> 42:54.240
series, finally confronting himself.

42:54.240 --> 42:57.960
That would be the most poetic way to conclude this whole saga, at least.

42:57.960 --> 43:01.480
I don't think I'll ever be fully able to answer the questions he poses to himself,

43:01.480 --> 43:06.360
and implies to us, through this series, because they're ones that no one can ever fully answer,

43:06.360 --> 43:10.280
but I hope that he finds some closure, and through that, inspire others to find their

43:10.280 --> 43:11.280
own.

43:11.280 --> 43:17.800
So yeah, Shane Dawson, net positive, with a few flaws, I think that's fair enough.

43:17.800 --> 43:22.080
Alright, I want to give a massive shoutout to the editors, they've done a stellar job,

43:22.080 --> 43:26.200
go and check them out if you can, I'm gonna leave their links in the pinned comments,

43:26.200 --> 43:30.100
they're brilliant people, brilliantly talented people, definitely go and check them out.

43:30.100 --> 43:33.700
On the other hand, I wanna say that if you wanna reach me, if you wanna talk about this

43:33.700 --> 43:37.460
topic, leave a comment below, but also you can reach me through Twitter, which is just

43:37.460 --> 43:41.500
as productive, or Facebook, or Discord, links in the pinned comment below.

43:41.500 --> 43:46.420
Anyhow, because I'm really tired, and a mess, I might go and get some sleep now.

43:46.420 --> 43:51.140
I appreciate you guys being here, it really does make a difference, and I hope that this

43:51.140 --> 43:52.900
video makes a difference too.

43:52.900 --> 43:57.900
So until then, I'm The Right Opinion, and I'll see you in the next one, love you guys.

44:00.100 --> 44:01.100
Bye.

44:01.100 --> 44:01.120
Bye.

44:30.100 --> 44:31.100
Bye.

44:31.100 --> 44:32.100
Bye.
