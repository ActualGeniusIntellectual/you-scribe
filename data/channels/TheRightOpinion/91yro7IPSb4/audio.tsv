0	23680	Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time and image.
23680	26960	It's something that a fair few people seem to care about.
27200	32400	And understandably so, in our communities there's nothing wrong with a bit of reputation conservation,
32400	37960	particularly if that aids your standing amongst others. Image can be reflected in our demeanor, our actions,
37960	42400	our comments, and equally, it will be defined by how people interpret that behaviour.
42400	48560	When we encounter human beings and other alike entities, we spend a lot of time trying to paint a mental picture
48560	50520	in our head for how we envision them.
50520	55760	Now, we cannot look into their minds and read their every intention, but some judgement is always necessary
55760	61360	because we have to make a decision which may involve bestowing responsibility or trust in certain people
61360	65000	down the line, and that mental picture has to be factored in.
65000	70000	However, this is typically reserved for personal relationships, and although we may hold greater opinions
70000	75400	about certain issues, we won't typically assign a face to it. This is particularly the case with corporations,
75400	80440	now it's completely valid to have distaste for corporations and their conduct, but it's also reasonable to accept
80440	85800	that most companies are made up of a lot of interacting tiers, and this can lead to them being pretty much
85800	90680	separated from the idea of consciousness altogether. Although I wouldn't actually agree with that and urge
90680	95920	others to keep in mind that a decision will typically have a person behind it, it is often hard to conceptually
95920	101640	feel any emotional connection to what a company may do. Hell, if we did that, we'd probably never stop being
101640	105080	upset, and we do need to look out for our mental wellbeing too, you know.
105240	111800	YouTube occupies a weird medium between the world of intimacy and distance, because although we may not feel
111800	117480	a connection to a lot of creators on a personal level, their success partly relies on the direct support that we
117480	122720	pledge towards them. A lot of celebrities feel a bit beyond our world, and YouTube creates communities that
122720	128280	people can be involved in, however, because of that, there is a bit more direct accountability, and a judgment
128280	133920	that does feel a little more personal. Therefore, we tend to apply certain standards for creators that we may not
133920	140360	give to large multinational corporations, partly because of that connection, and partly because we actually
140360	145680	have the power to hold them accountable. Over the last few years, we've witnessed companies attempt to be quote
145680	150760	woke, and relate to this human condition, yet it never feels particularly real because although amusing,
150760	156080	you receive the impression it's just another campaign focused towards a demographic of depressed teenagers
156080	160800	who occupy the Twitter hellscape. On top of this, the tweets are never really channeled through the mind of an
160800	165840	individual, and therefore we never put a face on the company or develop a personal connection.
165840	172880	However, in 2015, a business managed to infiltrate a then budding YouTube community through a character who
172880	178160	would become almost synonymous with the product that he was offering. Yes, long before the BetterHelp scandal
178160	182960	would cause many creators to re-evaluate how they keep an eye on sponsors they collaborate with, there was an
182960	188720	even more bewildering controversy surrounding one of the most iconic YouTube sponsors, Samurai Buyer.
188880	194320	Samurai, Samurai, Samurai, Samurai, Samurai Buyer.
194320	200560	Samurai Buyer is an online proxy buyer slash delivery service, which on first impressions wouldn't have the most
200560	206440	applicable market potential in the YouTube environment, particularly in unboxing content, which was the main
206440	212640	genre they were engaged in. However, this is where we introduce a man named Misaki, a now former representative
212640	218080	and marketing manager of the brand in question. In communication, he seemed to be an oblivious Japanese
218080	223360	gentleman attempting to sell merchandise to the western world with your happiness at heart. Brought to
223360	228800	stardom by his appearance on iDubbbz's Bad & Boxing series, he became renowned for his unassuming demeanour,
228800	234560	broken English, and habit of appropriating phrases in a rather unflattering, yet precious fashion.
234800	250320	Over the next one and a half years, the Samurai Buyer brand would expand their scope in working with multiple
250320	256640	YouTube personalities from across communities, capitalising on this reputation, while Misaki obtained a unique
256640	262320	status amongst creators and their audiences as a culturally sheltered, yet conscientious and enthusiastic
262320	268720	gentleman with the interests of his western friends as his utmost priority. In many ways, he became the face of
268720	274160	the brand, involved in a platform that treated him with the personal nature that he treated creators.
274160	287200	It was so, so wholesome, but was it too wholesome? In the world where corporate and personal become one,
287200	292400	the heavens will collide with the earth, and at the end of the spectacle, corporations and creators alike
292400	296800	realised why they were probably better off in different worlds.
296800	303280	Yesterday, my friends, is a story of deception, exploitation, and intimidation, with a side of legal fries,
303280	307680	and with that level of dramatic potential, you'd expect there to be a comprehensive backlog of creators
307680	313440	covering the situation, however due to reasons that we'll discuss later, the landscape otherwise seems sparse,
313680	318640	many of these videos having vanished from where they once were. Until recently, I was barely aware of this
318640	324800	situation, and under the impression that Misaki had merely honourably faded into obscurity, it appears that I was
324800	331360	wrong. Well today, we're attempting to fill that gap with as much information as I could find, some spicy storytelling,
331360	336880	and some hot takes for a cold case. It's been a while since we stepped in the YouTube time machine, and for people
336880	342720	who weren't there, you may not even be aware of the troubled legacy of a man and a business, but on principle,
342720	349200	appeared to encompass some of the purest qualities of YouTube culture. However, as a wise man once said,
349200	357200	expectations are for losers. Does that mean there's a story to tell? Oh yes it does, so I suggest we get right to it.
360000	365920	I guess the first specific question to answer is, what is Samurai Buyer? What sort of service do they offer?
365920	371520	Well, it's a delivery service, however the business doesn't hold stock themselves, what they tend to do is
371520	377040	purchase content that can be typically purchased in Japanese domains, ship it to their warehouse, and then
377040	382640	facilitate transportation of these goods which may otherwise be inhibited by international restrictions
382640	389200	on those specific sites. Typically this is related to online shopping, however these services also extends to
389200	394640	auctions, which sounds pretty fun if I'm to be honest. Because of their set up, you will probably be charged at
394640	400240	two separate points for the service, once for the items cost when you make the purchase, and then for the cost
400240	406240	of shipping once it's arrived at their warehouse with the weight and size measured. It's a curious system,
406240	411680	but I suppose it's one that makes sense. Samurai Buyer's about page doesn't really have much information
411680	417280	about their origins, it much more focuses on their features and the benefits of using their services.
417280	422640	This isn't a criticism, but given their lack of information elsewhere, how Samurai Buyer came into being
422640	427200	may appear to be a bit of an enigma. However, it would not surprise you to know that its existence
427200	433280	preceded its presence in YouTube communities. The first archives of the old site, SamuraiBuyer.jp,
433280	438640	appeared towards the end of 2014. In fact, this old article announcing the launch of Samurai Buyer
438640	444400	was published on the 14th of November 2014, which can give us a pretty strong grip on when it was
444400	450080	established. It was launched by the Bushido Corporation headed by Yasuhiro Tanaka, who was already
450080	455520	operating a similar service known as the Taobao Shinkansen, which helped deliver Chinese products to
455520	461120	those in Japan, the Taobao being a reference to the popular Chinese shopping website, and the Shinkansen
461120	465840	being a reference to the Japanese bullet train, symbolising their speedy service, I assume.
465840	470960	With the success of this venture, Bushido clearly sought to reapply the formula on a larger scale,
470960	477600	this time signalling intent to export Japanese items to China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and the United States.
477600	482160	In the first few months, this venture was well received, with another article being published in
482160	488480	March of 2015 proudly proclaiming that over 110,000 users had visited their websites before
488480	493680	and after the new year. However, the article focused on success predominantly within China,
493680	497680	and if we recall, in the previous article, we would have noted that they seemed to have their
497680	502480	sites set on the United States, however, there were a few key problems that were likely hindering
502480	507680	their progress in these markets. Now, we could talk about the lack of prestige, or the already
507680	512640	existent competition from within, but another significant problem was the language barrier.
512640	519120	Samurai Buyer had a website. This website did have an English language option, however, it was not the
519120	523600	most fluent. If you were browsing the web looking to purchase some foreign goods, and encountered
523600	528720	this website, which appears to possess the English skills of a spam email, it may not fill you with
528720	534720	the most confidence in their ability to deliver. Here are some of the examples.
534720	541360	The word of samurai is a symbol of Japan, but widely well known in the word. It is essential that
541360	547200	using Japanese when you purchase at Japanese online shops, and less shop support for English one,
547200	554000	our special staffs will assist you even though you cannot speak Japanese. These are my favourites,
554000	559120	but jokes aside, this poor grip with the English language is something that pervaded their website,
559120	564160	and would probably make any anglophone think twice about spending their hard earned cash on
564160	568560	such a convenience. So over the next few months, they worked on the linguistic flaws,
568560	573760	eventually creating a more accessible and trustworthy site. However, it was still a bit clunky
573760	578400	and unconvincing. Add this to other issues, and it was probable that they weren't quite performing
578400	583440	up to the level they were aspiring for. Now, at this time, there were a lot of creators on YouTube
583440	588320	doing these unboxing videos, some of which were sponsored content, however, unlike a lot of
588320	593360	businesses involved in this enterprise, Samurai Buyer weren't actually offering dedicated loot
593360	599360	crates. Nonetheless, someone, maybe even Misaki himself, had the audacious yet relatively ingenious
599360	604000	idea that they could be a part of this, and instead of using the boxes to promote a product,
604000	609040	they could use it to promote their delivery service. Conceptually, it worked, in fact, it works
609040	613520	incredibly well, because whereas with loot boxes you are constrained to showcase content that will
613520	617920	be congruent with what you're offering commercially, with Samurai Buyer, they could practically put
617920	622720	anything in the box as long as it was something you could buy yourself on their website. This
622720	627360	meant they could cater to the YouTuber's interests and compel more positive reviews and
627360	632800	enthused endorsements. It's not exactly clear when they began contacting YouTubers with their
632800	637600	propositions, however, iDubbbz wasn't actually the first person to work with them. I can't say for
637600	643280	certain who was, but what I do know is that on the 6th of September 2015, just under a fortnight
643280	648560	before Samurai Buyer's first appearance on the iDubbbz channel, a creator by the name of TheAnimeMan
648560	652560	uploaded a video called Where Do You Buy Awesome Japanese Goodies?
678560	699280	In this video, he answers the titular question, stating that you can, in fact, buy awesome
699280	703840	Japanese goodies from this website known as Samurai Buyer. As a video, it doesn't really
703840	708800	stand out from standard sponsored content, and there are no details regarding their interaction
708800	713840	other than that he seems to be relatively familiar with them. On principle, it made sense for a
713840	718800	company based in Japan to reach out to content creators who have audiences more engaged with
718800	723280	Japanese culture, and would have a greater desire to purchase their goods, thus finding greater
723280	728640	utility within the website. TheAnimeMan's video was well received, and obtained an adequate number
728640	733440	of reviews. This may have satisfied Mizaki and the crew over at Samurai Buyer, who were probably
733440	737920	unsure of what to exactly expect from their sponsored content, however, it's doubtful that
737920	741680	they could have foreseen the fortunes that one of their next clients would bring them.
741680	744480	Let's talk about that interesting character.
746240	752880	2015 iDubbbz, a bygone era for sure. In fact, that whole period feels like a blur, and I wouldn't
752880	757520	blame anyone for not remembering that iDubbbz didn't actually have the most prosperous year,
757520	762480	it definitely picked up at the end, but a lot of it was spent obtaining steady, yet gradual growth.
762480	767280	Nonetheless, he was carving out a firm niche with content that carried a general appeal,
767280	770080	or defining his brand as an independent creator.
770080	772160	I'll put a link shield on my forehead.
773840	781200	Hey ladies, do you like geek culture? Because I'm the biggest LoZ fan in the world.
781280	784960	I speedrun it, and I go best past the cuckoos.
784960	791040	By September 2015, iDubbbz had two main series which were held in relatively high esteem by his
791040	796000	audience, these were Kickstarter Craft and Bad Unboxing. The former is of little relevance,
796000	800400	the latter is what caught the attention of Samurai Buyer. The Bad Unboxing series had been
800400	806400	running since 2014, and consisted of our good friend Ian iDubbbz unboxing various items,
806400	810800	testing them, often in unorthodox fashion, and then delivering his verdict.
810800	818000	May the Triforce be with you. Oh my god. My brain is starting to hemorrhage a little bit.
818880	823200	Some of his content was just Ian opening up what he felt like, but in the months approaching the
823200	828560	Samurai Buyer saga, he had increased focus on loot crates, and methods of destroying their content.
828560	834080	Nonetheless, these videos did receive a consistent number of views, and retained a dedicated fanbase.
834080	838960	Now iDubbbz's channel wasn't exclusively Japanophilic, god, what an ugly word,
838960	843600	but regardless, he had exhibited interest in Japanese culture, and previously advertised
843600	848400	products from the nation. Whether this factored into Samurai Buyer's decision to approach Mr.
848400	854160	iDubbbz is another question, but they clearly saw an opportunity to win over some new buyers of
854160	859440	the Samurai. To a sponsor, probably one of the most attractive features of iDubbbz's content
859440	864400	is that he wasn't created defined by the topics he was covering, it was carried by his distinct
864400	868960	persona, which meant that there was a level of security in the traffic that he would receive,
868960	874240	even if it was the most unappealing topic, like some sponsored uploads are. This is probably why
874240	878640	a lot of sponsors worked with iDubbbz in spite of his relatively modest size at the time,
878640	884080	he elevated the content by being able to apply his natural self and provided promotion,
884080	886960	even if he wasn't always the most complimentary.
886960	891440	iDubbbz, I can't believe you burned your subscriber plaque and also put guacamole on your
891520	897040	Triforce Be With You t-shirt. I can't believe it. I'm gonna throw in the trash now. I'm not even
897040	900720	gonna wash it. I could wash it easily. It would take two f***ing seconds, but you know what I'm
900720	904320	gonna do? I'm gonna throw in the trash. Wanna know why? Because I don't give a f***.
904320	909680	Now although the English on the Samurai Buyer website was passable, what a handsome man by the
909680	915280	way, their social media posts indicated that they may still lack the necessary proficiency to operate
915280	920960	a particularly successful PR campaign. However, with intrepid, slightly misplaced confidence,
921040	926080	they proceeded to connect with Ian and arrange their first collaboration, uploaded on the 16th
926080	932400	of September 2015. Today we're gonna be unboxing some P.O. Box packages, these three are sent to me
932400	937600	I think by fans, not exactly sure. The fourth one here was sent to me by a good friend that I met
937600	943360	a couple weeks ago, his name is Misaki. In this video, Samurai Buyer didn't occupy the whole
943360	948000	review, as the limelight was shared with some other fan mail. However, iDubbbz appeared to take
948000	952800	an immediate liking to the product shared with him, some of which appealed to his more destructive,
952800	954800	even masochistic tendencies.
954800	961440	You sent me the good stuff Misaki, I don't, I know I don't have as many nerve endings on my foot, but
961440	970160	you know. Oh Misaki, Misaki, Misaki, please don't hurt me, please don't hurt me Misaki, I do not want this.
970160	977280	Oh shit, I almost bit my tongue off. Misaki? More like Mishaki.
977280	982560	However, this was only half the appeal, the other half being the interaction with Misaki.
983280	988640	My name is Misaki from Japan, I am watching your movie on YouTube and want you to introduce my
988640	992640	Japanese products on your channel, please let me know if you're interested.
992640	997520	Now in many environments, this sort of email would have been dismissed as spam, but iDubbbz chose to
997520	1002720	entertain it, firstly because he's an entertainer, and even if nothing had come of it, it would have
1002720	1007360	made for an amusing story, and secondly, someone's offering to send you goods for free. The worst
1007360	1011280	thing that can happen is that they don't send you the produce, or they send you something rather
1011280	1015920	unpleasant, which iDubbbz may well have preferred to be honest. In his book, it was a win-win.
1015920	1021040	In the exchange that follows, Misaki appears to unknowingly win over the affection of iDubbbz and
1021040	1025840	his viewers. Yes, I would love to make a video for your products, send me the craziest stuff you have,
1025840	1031440	samurai swords, body pillows, whatever you want. Okay, I will, and may I know your real name and
1031440	1033760	also phone number which require for shipment?
1033760	1038960	So let's break down this defining conversation. A person who we assume to be Misaki reaches out
1038960	1043840	in broken English, which although unprofessional on a website, can be rather endearing in
1043840	1048800	conversation. In this instance, one can assume it's because of inexperience, but we tend to conflate
1048800	1054400	this with stereotypes of innocence and naivety. It's also quite amusing, I used those delightful
1054400	1059040	quotes earlier for comedic purposes, but combined with the other conditions, it can enable some
1059040	1064800	pretty exquisite meme potential. However, the job was not done for Misaki. In rather typical iDubbbz
1064800	1069360	fashion, Ian employs some offensive language in communicating with Misaki, particularly in
1069360	1070160	addressing him.
1070160	1071760	Ian- Have you got the parcel yet?
1071760	1073680	Misaki- Not yet, I'll check it tomorrow.
1073680	1078480	Now, Misaki could rebuff this or break off communication altogether, but he absorbs it,
1078480	1082960	and then uses it to further self-deprecate himself. In these positions, it brings a lot of
1082960	1087760	personality to the conversation. It's this guy, trying to hold a discussion on the level with
1087760	1092000	iDubbbz, but not quite getting there. It's funny, and it's cutesy.
1092000	1095520	Ian- My bad, yellow man, I got the package today, I can't wait to open it.
1095520	1100160	Equally, however, it establishes a firm bond between the sponsor and the client. You'll see the
1100160	1105200	term Misaki, and Samurai Buyer often used interchangeably. Now, technically speaking, they
1105200	1110080	are very different entities. Misaki is merely the representative of a much larger business,
1110080	1115280	because the job of sponsored videos is to focus on the product, Misaki's personality became an
1115280	1120720	asset to the product itself. Misaki's personality put a face on the company, and that's not often
1120720	1125840	done for many reasons, many of which will be revealed in due time. However, for the moment,
1125840	1130880	Misaki was like that out of touch grandad trying to be cool, but in a way, the failure was just as
1130880	1135360	captivating, and this four minute appearance outlined the start of a beautiful and fortuitous
1135360	1138720	relationship, one that seemed to only blossom over the coming years.
1141040	1154560	After the success of Samurai Buyer's first appearance on the iDubbbz channel, both parties
1154560	1159440	seemed eager to work together again, and just over two weeks later, iDubbbz uploaded another
1159440	1165040	Bad Unboxing, this time committing his undivided attention to the contents of Misaki's care package.
1165040	1170240	Hello everyone, and welcome back to another episode of Bad Unboxing Samurai Buyer Edition.
1170240	1174960	On the last episode of Samurai Buyer Unboxing, we took a look at a lot of products that Misaki
1174960	1180640	sent us, and some products that Misaki didn't send us. From now on, anything sent by Misaki,
1180640	1185200	or Samurai Buyer as a whole, we're gonna unbox on its own. We're also gonna take a look at what
1185200	1190320	Misaki's feedback was on the previous video. iDubbbz also discloses their dialogue following
1190320	1194480	the initial upload, which appears to have devolved since their previous conversation.
1194480	1198800	Now, it's point blank offensive humour without too much depth to it, however, one thing that you
1198800	1204480	could observe is the building of a rapport between iDubbbz and Misaki. Misaki appears to mould himself
1204480	1210000	around the conversation, he reached out originally with a rather ordinary email. The only detail one
1210000	1214880	could observe was the linguistic deficit, and as iDubbbz applied his rather signature style of
1214880	1220320	humour, Misaki seemed to adapt. By the end of their second email, our Samurai representative
1220320	1225280	appeared to be innovating with this humour, often once again to rather painful outcomes
1225280	1230240	in my opinion, including referring to Japan as the Yellow Island. Now, with jokes like this,
1230240	1234400	which would be considered somewhat distasteful by many, you might receive the impression that
1234400	1239120	he doesn't entirely know what he actually means, and his lack of awareness is what many would find
1239120	1244160	amusing. But remember that Misaki was the person to refer to this in the first place, which means
1244160	1249280	he's likely making some active effort to appeal to iDubbbz's humour, including making some statements
1249280	1251440	which may arouse one's suspicion.
1251440	1272080	Misaki's English may not have been immaculate, but I do think he had a grip on the effect of
1272080	1277040	such a comment, in fact even iDubbbz was mildly suspicious as to the identity behind this
1277040	1289920	character. However, it was another successful video, with iDubbbz reacting to the items with
1289920	1293280	a degree of elation and dare I say it, emotion.
1307600	1313040	Over the next few months, they would cultivate a strong working relationship with unique
1313040	1317680	assortments of items, accompanied by a presentation which would raise a few eyebrows elsewhere,
1317680	1323120	but not on the 2015 iDubbbz channel, no they were right at home here. As I mentioned earlier,
1323120	1328000	towards the end of 2015, iDubbbz began to experience substantial growth, and as I also
1328000	1333200	mentioned, Ian's content often had a peel which was transcended of the topics. The other facet
1333200	1338000	that became incredibly beneficial for Ian was his strong production value and consistent brand,
1338000	1342960	it gave his older content a lot of rewatch value for new audiences, and this led to cumulative
1342960	1347920	views on previous uploads, which in turn yielded their promotion on the YouTube algorithm.
1347920	1352480	At this point, Samurai Buyer had become a bit of a running meme on iDubbbz's channel, we spoke
1352480	1357600	about the image he garnered earlier, but it was like this hilarious naivete. Misaki demonstrated
1357600	1362000	a very surface level grip on language and personality, which allowed iDubbbz to often
1362000	1367280	control the conversation with a level of irony, and exploit Misaki's inexperience in a rather
1367280	1371680	underhanded fashion. Now this could be seen as quite mean spirited, but because iDubbbz didn't
1371680	1376000	do it in a way which directly put Misaki down, or even portrayed the language barrier as this
1376000	1380800	inherent disadvantage, and more as grounds for comedic potential, people enjoyed it.
1380800	1385760	Ian's happy, Misaki's happy, who would break up such a happy home?
1385760	1391200	Well, although iDubbbz and Misaki had become their own power couples, Samurai Buyer was still focused
1391200	1395840	on acquiring publicity from across the YouTube spectrum. Their collaboration with iDubbbz was
1395840	1400160	a blessing for sure, but it was a mixed blessing, because although their appearance on Ian's channel
1400160	1404000	would almost certainly increase their chances of landing future collaborations with similar
1404000	1408560	creators, it also placed them in a rather awkward dilemma regarding their reputation.
1408560	1413600	Now normally, linguistic proficiency is something that you would want to be improved upon experience
1413600	1418000	and budget, something that a company like Samurai Buyer would definitely have the resources to
1418000	1422640	accomplish, but in this instance, Misaki's poor English became so associated with the brand,
1422640	1427120	that people harbored this expectation they would receive the same treatment, even if it was
1427120	1432000	distinctly unprofessional. It was more entertaining, and it set them apart from other businesses.
1432000	1436000	It was this enshrined meme status, and they were going to make the most of it.
1436000	1440080	I knew that from iDubbbz's video that he messed around with Misaki a little bit, but I think I
1440080	1443920	took it to the next level and made him fall in love with me. I'll open the box in a second, Misaki,
1443920	1446160	just I want to share everyone the emails because they're funny.
1446160	1451520	Throughout 2016, a large majority of Samurai Buyer videos were replicated in iDubbbz's format,
1451520	1455760	with the content sometimes being delegated to an even more secondary position than the
1455760	1460560	email interactions. In Jade Animation's videos, she spends just under 10 minutes talking about
1460560	1465600	their interaction before reviewing the products. It makes sense in her format, but it is a testament
1465600	1471040	to how much of a force of personality Mr Misaki was considered to be, with him leaving a lasting
1471040	1474160	positive impression on many of the creators he collaborated with.
1485760	1490160	This was the consensus. It was a sense of innocence that seemed to pervade his attitude,
1490160	1494560	even if people did solicit humour from the interactions they shared with him. In many ways,
1494560	1499920	his attempt to understand another culture beyond him appealed to people's innate senses of sympathy
1499920	1504800	and warmth. How could you not help this modest Japanese man looking for a little promotion for
1504800	1511120	his service from the big YouTuber Senpai? All he wants to do is help all you weeaboos out there.
1529920	1537520	All these creators played along like it was some funny little in-joke, but in less than two years,
1537520	1542720	Samurai Buyer had unleashed its market potential, not just in the United States, but all across the
1542720	1547200	Western Hemisphere, bolstered by the image of its eccentric representative who had won over the
1547200	1553200	hearts of his clients. However, when success hinges on one person's image, does failure not as well?
1553760	1555680	Well, let's talk about it.
1560880	1570000	Towards the end of 2016, Samurai Buyer maintained their vigorous promotional campaign, and you
1570000	1574640	honestly wouldn't notice too much wrong. I did note one negative review on Reddit around September
1574640	1579360	time, but otherwise you'd be hard pressed to find any controversy. However, Misaki himself did seem
1579360	1581280	to be quite persistent at points.
1581280	1588560	Misaki- I just went on hiatus from Misaki for so long, he's really just been hitting me up over and over and over for months now.
1588560	1594160	So here you guys go, Samurai Buyer is back, and Misaki Dearest is shipping. Literally.
1594160	1600320	iDubbbz, who had not uploaded a Samurai Buyer-related video since March of 2016, then uploaded one in November,
1600320	1603120	which seemed to be slightly more cynical in its tone.
1603120	1609200	But Misaki's really been getting at my fucking nerves this past year, you know, always chatting my
1609200	1616000	ear off about dumb shit, wanting me to do things for him. And to prove that, I've stolen his gay logo,
1616000	1624240	and I put it on a sweatshirt, and any proceeds from selling these sweatshirts or shirts will go directly to me and not Misaki.
1624240	1625680	So fuck you, Misaki.
1625680	1633600	This led some to question whether iDubbbz actually had any vitriol towards Misaki, as the relationship was appearing to manifest into a more cruel affair.
1633600	1640240	Now, although there were some comments which did appear to be quite cutting in their nature, alongside one that I do intend to return to later,
1640240	1645280	if Ian was possessing any ill will, I doubt he would have given Samurai Buyer any attention at all,
1645280	1650080	including promotion for a new vacancy, which is where our story takes us next.
1650080	1655360	If you paid attention to that trainwreck of a conversation, you may have noticed there was some talk about a Google form,
1655360	1662080	that's just some shit Misaki wants me to promote for Samurai Buyer. I'll put it in the description, click it or don't,
1662080	1664080	send your sperm to him, I don't care.
1664080	1671040	In his Samurai Buyer video, alongside a rather cringe conversation where Misaki mistakes spams for sperm and such,
1671040	1680320	glorious hijinks, Misaki informs iDubbbz he is hiring for a position, a person who is interested in anime content and has competence in social media marketing.
1680320	1687200	This was announced by iDubbbz and accompanied by an application form, however, because the iDubbbz fandom are predominantly shitposters,
1687200	1694640	and there had already been a hilarious sperm joke, most people just filled out the application under the denomination of Sperm, big funny.
1694640	1700560	However, there was one successful applicant, and this person was an individual by the name of Meriwether.
1700640	1706720	Meriwether is a creator slash producer who hails from Scandinavia, nowadays he's known for his work on anime girls,
1706720	1710720	but back then he was a community freshman looking for a way into the industry.
1710720	1715040	I prefaced that I bumped into the guy when working on another project, which didn't quite come to fruition,
1715040	1721680	but my personal impression has always been positive, and we are on good terms, though I note it may influence my interpretation of the situation,
1721680	1724400	I will do my best to present the differing perspectives.
1724400	1730320	Meriwether was a fan of iDubbbz, but unlike the rest of the Google form respondents, decided to take it seriously,
1730320	1733760	applying for the job being offered by the folks over at Samurai Buyer.
1733760	1737680	His application was successful, and he took up his job in this foreign land.
1737680	1745200	In January he tweeted out that he was working with Samurai Buyer on the social media front, covering their communications and social media.
1745200	1752240	Now, unfortunately, last year the original Samurai Buyer Twitter account was yeeted, so there's not too much that can be said regarding its interactions,
1752240	1758560	but as we know, there appeared to be no apparent conflict, or anything that would prime people's expectations for what was about to transpire.
1758560	1764720	In fact, it seems that Meriwether ran the Twitter account very successfully, and increased their follower count over tenfold.
1764720	1773280	For a few months, all was serene, but come April there was drama afoot, drama that would change the way people perceived Samurai Buyer and Misaki.
1773280	1784160	It was April the 22nd, a fine day for a Twitlonger, and boy oh boy did we receive one, one delivered by the now former Samurai Buyer employee, Meriwether.
1784160	1792880	In it, detailing his rather unpleasant experience with the assumedly harmless Misaki, and some very shocking revelations about the company and their marketing campaign.
1792880	1797680	Meriwether said that he had moved down to Tokyo after quitting his job to pursue a position at Samurai Buyer.
1797680	1806000	Now, after a successful stint managing their Twitter and encouragement from Misaki to extend his stay, Meriwether decided to move from Tokyo to their offices at Fukuoka.
1806000	1813120	However, all was not as imagined for Meriwether as the work environment didn't fulfil his expectations due to the rather unnerving atmosphere,
1813200	1818560	which made Meriwether in part accountable to Misaki's cold and distant behaviour, which played into his paranoia.
1818560	1827920	In spite of this, Meriwether states he worked on numerous successful projects, including an actual loot box about time, and achieved the company target set for him far ahead of schedule.
1827920	1839600	However, following the completion of these tasks, Meriwether decided to move back to Tokyo, so to feel more comfortable, at which point Misaki revoked all of Meriwether's social media account permissions and access to company related communications,
1839680	1849280	citing self-promotion as the reason he was fired, something which Meri immediately disputed, showing the contradictory narrative by a Skype user we assume to be Misaki.
1849280	1855040	Samurai Buyer would regularly change the reasons why he was fired, giving some the impression it was more personal.
1855040	1864480	Meriwether also shows DMs of this user behaving rather mockingly towards him, including changing his profile picture to all the Scandinavian flags bar Denmark,
1864480	1872800	because Meriwether is from Denmark, and even threatening to call a lawyer at one point when another creator ceases their collaboration with him due to the dismissal,
1872800	1876080	because you know, people in this community care about others.
1876080	1888400	However, it doesn't end there, Meriwether notes the lexicon and responds to those who might excuse it due to Misaki's inexperience with the language, stating that Misaki is in fact highly westernised, even having resided in Australia for years.
1888560	1900080	What? Yes, we'll return to take a look at the verifiability of this story in due time, but Meriwether's account states that Misaki's persona was actually the result of him instructing an African employee to spam YouTubers,
1900080	1908480	only realising the potential when Eidos found amusement in the broken English. Once he has contact, he then proceeds to badger the creators for free promotions,
1908480	1916000	so he can maintain his position at the company and take a paid vacation to America, interesting detail but whatever floats your boat I guess.
1916000	1924240	Meriwether stated that he believed that Misaki's decision was based on how Misaki no longer saw use for Meriwether at the company, and although understanding of that reasoning,
1924240	1931440	still felt that Misaki's treatment of him was unjustified, given that Misaki was the person who encouraged Meriwether to extend his stay in Japan.
1931440	1937120	It seemed irresponsible at best, and downright malicious at worst, which is not what you really want to hear.
1937120	1943680	Additional claims were also made in the Twitlong about the service, including the assertion that they charge quote mystery fees for shipping,
1943680	1951680	and putting you in a position where you may end up paying extortionate delivery fees for modestly priced items, and although you can receive a refund for the shipping fee
1951680	1957920	because you've purchased it, you can't obtain a refund for the item, which would then be placed into one of their mystery boxes.
1957920	1965120	Basically, the allegation here is that Samurai Buyer structure corners the consumer into paying much more than they may initially assume,
1965120	1967840	which allowed Samurai Buyer to rip off their clients.
1968240	1978080	There's also further testimony about the way that Misaki behaved, the legality of the dismissal, and further adjuncts which served as supplementary responses to claims made by other parties involved.
1978080	1985280	But the core message was clear, Misaki was not who you, or nearly anybody, thought he was, and it didn't end there.
1985280	2002480	This Twitlonger did reasonably well at the time, it received a fair few likes and retweets, and although it never really went viral, it caught the attention of relevant parties,
2002480	2008080	such as iDubbbz, and fellow creators who may be considering a collaboration with Samurai Buyer in the future.
2008080	2012640	Loads of negative reviews were posted about their products and people's experiences with the website,
2012640	2020640	my favourite one being a rather disgruntled user who claimed that upon ordering a Samurai Buyer mystery box, received a decapitated toy gorilla.
2020640	2027280	Now, I cannot possibly comment on the actuality of such an anecdote, but it should show where people stood in the moment.
2027280	2033600	Misaki may not be the business, but he was the face, and when the face was smited, so was the business.
2033600	2041120	I'd also add that there was a whole other drama that this spawned, which continued the rest of the year that includes another rabbit hole going to much darker places,
2041120	2048480	where Misaki's involvement was vague. Maybe that'll be for another time, but now we'll focus on where people's attention was regarding this situation.
2048480	2054400	Some creators who had previously collaborated with Samurai Buyer also made their own statements of solidarity with Mary.
2054400	2060320	There was an additional drama related to statements that Misaki had allegedly made on call regarding one of their first collaborators,
2060320	2070000	the Anime Man, which is a statement that we'll return to later. In response to this, the Anime Man stated that he had ceased working with them due to the fact that he found elements of the operation fairly sketchy,
2070000	2077840	not the most glamorous endorsement. Some even asked whether Mary had grounds to sue for unlawful dismissal, and whether the legal argument was in his favour,
2077840	2084960	which I'm not sure it was, given the fact that he wasn't full time. Nonetheless, he was in a foreign country with little money and limited time,
2084960	2091440	it was not practical, which is probably why they sacked him, because what was he gonna do? Well, uh, this.
2091440	2099360	On top of this, other creators began to post videos onto YouTube, people began to spread the word, and suddenly it seemed like the whole world would know about
2099360	2109200	the injustice of Samurai Buyer. However, as quickly as it was picking up, it was shut down. One evening, Meriwether appeared to tweet out legal threats which had been made by Misaki,
2109200	2118960	and the next day this was followed by Meriwether first tweeting in a frenzied manner at iDubbbz begging for help, followed by a rather unconvincing tweet stating that everything he said was a lie.
2118960	2127440	This was briefly followed by him pulling down all his tweets and statements, and commenting that he didn't want to deal with any lawsuits, and just wanted to leave it behind immediately.
2127680	2135280	At around this point, Samurai Buyer had made the statement that they would be conducting further investigations before releasing another more official statement.
2135280	2144400	This response then followed an alleged discussion yielding from a thread posted on Twitter. This Twitlonger victoriously stated that Mary had now admitted to twisting the statements,
2144400	2153200	as well as an invasion of privacy against the corporation. However, for Meriwether's own sake, for his own privacy, like the magnanimous gentile sir that he was,
2153280	2158000	Misaki decided not to go into details regarding this, because you can trust him.
2158000	2166880	The thing is, when you don't give examples, then people don't have anything to look at, which pretty much implies that you're lying through your teeth.
2166880	2175680	In the Twitlonger, they mostly honed in on the claims that Samurai Buyer was a scam, a point which had now been adopted by some of the company's most staunchest critics,
2175680	2184000	and even some former fans. They reiterate that they do ask for payments, but that is inevitable, as they cannot be certain of their own transportation fees,
2184000	2193680	due to the destination, the weight of the content, and the size of the items varying on a case-by-case basis. However, they pledge to make this detail clearer to avoid any confusion down the line,
2193680	2199680	and apologise for any concern that was raised. On top of this, they state that they are intending to extend their service promotion code,
2199680	2205840	a weeaboo, which will halve any service fee, and epic detail to fulfil all your weeaboo wishes. Hooray.
2205840	2212480	They conclude by requesting people to continue supporting Samurai Buyer, so that they can continue to improve their customer service,
2212480	2219280	which I'm not sure is the best justification, but we'll let that slide for now, as there are more pressing matters at hand.
2219280	2226400	Maybe Misaki was hoping that this response would go viral. Unfortunately, it did not. In fact, given the deletion of all the tweets,
2226400	2234160	it seems people's investment in the situation dropped off very sharply. Maybe this was for the best, as the people who did read it didn't find it the most persuasive,
2234160	2241120	partly because releasing DMs where someone admits they're wrong wouldn't be a violation of their privacy, especially after you've sacked them.
2241120	2251040	Misaki trying to use it to morally grandstands seemed transparent, and people cottoned onto the fact that these DMs may have been more telling about Misaki's behaviour than anyone else's.
2251040	2259760	On top of this, when he said someone's statements were quote twisted, well, it was unbelievably vague, and certainly not a clarification of what was true and what wasn't.
2259760	2268400	Further to this, stating that someone invaded your privacy when all they did was accuse you of doing shady stuff, and showing DMs of someone who is allegedly you being a prick,
2268400	2275600	just sounds like you're admitting to the shady stuff and are mad that someone called you out for it. It's basically attacking someone for being a whistleblower.
2275600	2287440	Combine this with Misaki's legal threats that users had observed the night before, and to them it seemed that he had threatened a distressed person who was in a foreign country with little experience into a position of silence, not a good look.
2287440	2297840	On top of this, the Twitlonger just didn't really talk about much. Sure, the scamming point was pretty important, but equally, the assertion of treatment and that Misaki wasn't who he presented himself as was pretty relevant too.
2297840	2304240	Now, no comment doesn't mean an admission of guilt, but it was gonna be hard for creators to reinvest their trust in him or his brand.
2304240	2312800	I assume some of these creators discussed it privately before placing disclaimers in their description, clarifying their position on the matter, and mostly not complimentary ones.
2312800	2320280	The gauntlet had been laid down, and although Mero's tweets may have been removed, a lot of people's content and narratives were still prevalent in this discourse,
2320280	2323480	which didn't make the Samurai Buyer team very happy.
2323480	2335600	One of those creators talking about the matter was a young, then small YouTuber by the name of Slazo.
2335600	2346760	Slazo had previously worked with Samurai Buyer himself, but upon finding out about this situation, had made the decision to terminate their relationship and upload a video calling them out for their shady business practices.
2346840	2359320	Now, because of this new information coming out, I have privatized my video I made with Samurai Buyer, which is annoying because I liked that video, but I just can't stand by and endorse the actions of Misaki.
2359320	2369880	Now, Samurai Buyer is a company that doesn't care about its product, it only cares about the bottom line. They want to find the easiest way to make money, even if it means ripping people off.
2369880	2376360	Well, now we know that money is number one priority, over ethics, over customer service, over everything.
2376360	2382920	And so it's very safe to say that the reason he fired Merry was because Merry had fulfilled his purpose.
2382920	2391000	He had increased their social media's following by many times. A new mascot, a new subscription service, he'd made them a lot.
2391000	2396520	He had laid out a clear plan for them that they could easily follow, and he was no longer required.
2396520	2402200	His video tended to mirror the claims made by Merryweather in the Twitlonger, making the video rather straightforward.
2402200	2412440	However, as an upload on the situation, it garnered significant traction, obtaining over 400,000 views, thus becoming one of the predominant narratives for those wondering what happened.
2412440	2420600	He also uploaded a follow-up video on the matter, which acquired a further 100,000 views. However, these are not videos that I want to focus on, no.
2420600	2431320	In another video uploaded a few months after his original videos covering the situation, he details a serious legal threat made by the Samurai Buyer team, but one that appeared to be quite empty.
2450600	2458360	The damages inflicted to us also continued to worsen, and we can no longer ignore the issue.
2458360	2470760	Consequently, we formally request that the two videos concerning Samurai Buyer and the scandal occurring after a member of our staff was terminated to be removed within seven days of this mail received.
2470760	2480200	If seven days passes without compliance or negotiation, we will be forced to consider legal action to arrange videos removed and damages.
2480200	2483000	Um, that was two months ago.
2483000	2489400	I responded asking what parts of the video in question they considered false, and they just responded with,
2489400	2494760	everything bad I said about them, just in quotes, and that's it.
2494760	2506600	I responded asking how exactly my claims were wrong and what the evidence was, and they just responded a half month later, just asking me to take the video down.
2506600	2517720	Um, and now let me clarify, if there was actually something I said that was wrong or misconstrued in that video, and they told me, just straight up told me why it was wrong,
2517720	2528920	then I would do everything in my power to make sure people know that that was wrong. I would pin a comment on both of those videos, I would say it in this video, I would make it known.
2528920	2537960	But instead, they hit me with this legal action notice, this, if you don't respond in a week, we will take legal action for damages.
2537960	2542280	No you're not, no you're not, and that is just the worst way to go about this.
2542280	2548120	All it results in is a worse image for your business, something that you don't want, and I don't want to deal with.
2548120	2555080	However, the professional legal team over at Samurai Buyer persisted with the notices, and these videos were eventually removed,
2555080	2560040	as alongside other factors that we'll discuss soon, Slazo felt they had served their purpose.
2560040	2567160	Another creator who uploaded a video on the situation alluded to a similar experience with Samurai Buyer as recently as ten months ago,
2567160	2571960	over two years after this conflict, on a video with seventeen thousand views.
2571960	2578280	Now, a majority of what I've spoken about today has been removed since, some of which could be partly credited to Samurai Buyer's
2578280	2584040	resolute approach towards those who have spoken about it, and the fact that no large creator was particularly outspoken,
2584040	2590280	perhaps due to the fact that many of them had worked with Samurai Buyer themselves and felt rather embarrassed or awkward about it.
2590280	2596680	Samurai Buyer has mostly succeeded in suppressing the situation, and with the source of sentiments conveyed in their emails,
2596680	2603000	you'd think they'd have reason to. You would receive the impression that Samurai Buyer's business was mortally wounded by this coverage,
2603000	2611080	but I can't say I completely agree. In fact, I think the damage was already done the moment that creators and audiences thought they were being deceived.
2611080	2614360	If they were, is another question. Let's talk about that.
2627560	2635560	As I mentioned earlier, Misaki and Samurai Buyer had a close association, and an even closer one assumed by many audiences.
2635560	2641320	Misaki's place in these sponsorships was as much a selling point as the product or the services themselves.
2641320	2647880	Misaki-Hello, awesome, I send you cool things. May I know your name and phone number it needs for shipments?
2647880	2652360	Then he asked if you could Skype me and I said, it's 3am babe, I'm gonna have a kip if that's okay.
2652360	2655960	In which he apologised profusely cause he's a lovely polite Japanese man.
2655960	2660240	So when it was supposedly revealed that Misaki was not the man who people believed him to be,
2660240	2665960	and was in fact the result of an accident which was exploited by a rather calculated individual who was not actually
2665960	2670760	the representation of innocence, people probably felt rather deceived, especially YouTubers,
2670760	2676280	some of whom were probably a tad embarrassed, bantering with this guy who was just so unassuming about your little
2676280	2683240	English jokes, and you exploiting the shortfalls for a little banter. Instead, the YouTuber was in fact the one being
2684120	2689800	Because a lot of these creators probably wouldn't have made videos if they were approached by a smart, well-spoken businessman.
2689800	2695040	Some people like Jaiden Animations, who appeared to have such affection for Misaki, didn't know what to believe
2695040	2699360	because of the person who she thought she had come to know. So what should we believe?
2699360	2705960	Well, looking retrospectively at some of the conversations, it's hard to feel a slightly contrived nature in certain comments.
2705960	2711880	In a way, this was expected, because the way Misaki marketed himself tended to adapt to the person he was talking to,
2711880	2717280	he'd be more offensive around the edgy commentators, and more wholesome around the more family-friendly creators,
2717280	2724640	but at the same time, this doesn't really alter comments such as I English no good, or the confusing spam with sperm conversation.
2724640	2730520	In hindsight, it seems glaringly obvious, but if you don't consider it, you probably wouldn't have noticed.
2730520	2736440	I think although at the time, iDubbbz probably wasn't overly suspicious, he may well have been entertaining the possibility
2736440	2738840	that he was being hoodwinked for the sake of clowns.
2738840	2746200	Misaki's really been getting at my fucking nerves this past year, you know, always chatting my ear off about dumb shit,
2746200	2754680	wanting me to do things for him, and it's like, dude, I really like it that you're so non-PC, and I really appreciate that.
2754680	2761680	You know, there's a lot of non-PC Asians out there, okay? You're not unique, Misaki. You don't have a stranglehold over me.
2761680	2767600	It's this comment I found particularly interesting, because you receive the impression that Samurai Bayou was drilling in this persona
2767640	2773640	to the point where even iDubbbz was moderately irritated by it, and if you make iDubbbz pissed off at edgy humour,
2773640	2775560	then you're probably doing something wrong.
2775560	2781760	Ian went on to make this future comment about Samurai Bayou, which although hard to read into because it's Ian,
2781760	2789120	seems to imply that he may have been quite happy that he finally had an excuse to end his relationship with Misaki and Samurai Bayou.
2789120	2796920	It's hard to read into a lot of edgy creators and their opinions on the business, because it's often veiled in thick irony,
2796960	2803240	but just over a month before the drama transpired, another creator, and friend of iDubbbz by the name of Max Mofo,
2803240	2809600	made a video where he didn't seem particularly thrilled by the content sent to him either, nor the circumstances.
2809600	2818360	I think we have a box from Misaki, I didn't actually want him to send me anything, he kind of forced himself on me,
2818400	2828840	and now I feel rude not to open it, I think he's the only person in the industry where you can, you have to open his shit for free.
2828840	2836840	Most YouTubers I feel, to do sponsored videos or anything by a product, usually there's a little bit of, you know, back and forth involved,
2836840	2845320	but iDubbbz pretty much made Misaki famous, and now he thinks he can fucking parade his shit everywhere and everyone will just open it for him.
2845720	2851000	And he sent me jack shit, I don't think he thinks much of me, there's not much to work with here.
2851000	2856520	I think the joke may have been wearing thin, and perhaps people would have found out by their own accord eventually,
2856520	2861480	but it was a tad too premature for people's liking, which led to the rather abrupt response.
2861480	2867640	On top of this, although I note at the start that their social media presence as English wasn't very good throughout most of 2015,
2867640	2873960	I'd also note that it had significantly improved in the run up to the iDubbbz collaboration, with only occasional English mistakes,
2873960	2877480	and certainly not ones that were exhibited in future conversations.
2877480	2882280	I think there were definitely elements of Misaki's personality that were played out for theatrical effect,
2882280	2889240	but was the extent of the deceit really as far as implied? Was Misaki a fluent English speaker who had spent time in Australia?
2889240	2895160	Well, let's reintroduce the Anime Man. The Anime Man was the guy who worked with Samurai Buyer before iDubbbz,
2895160	2903080	he was also an Australian living in Japan, and his subsequent withdrawal from doing business with Samurai Buyer would certainly make an observant individual take a second glance.
2903080	2909080	But hell, maybe he was just jealous of the fact that other creators didn't have to pay for their promotion as Misaki claims.
2909080	2911240	Wait, Misaki claimed that?
2911240	2921880	Misaki- He's a pretty nice guy, but you know, he's never already fired me these days, I don't know. Maybe some jealousy.
2921880	2929800	In a clip briefly leaked at the height of the drama, an individual who appears to be Misaki seems to be talking about the Anime Man in quite effortless fashion,
2929800	2933080	perhaps with the slightest tinge of an Australian accent.
2933080	2934440	Misaki- Joey, you mean?
2934440	2935640	Joey- Joey, yeah.
2935640	2936600	Misaki- You know him?
2936600	2939320	Joey- No, I don't, I've just seen you've worked with him.
2939320	2944280	Misaki- Yeah, he's actually staying, he was staying in Australia.
2944280	2947080	Joey- Oh yeah, I heard he moved to Japan.
2947080	2950440	Misaki- Yes, he's half Australian and Japanese.
2950440	2957800	Now, in all fairness to Misaki, he doesn't really say anything particularly inflammatory, he seems to be theorising in quite a freeform manner,
2957800	2965160	but equally that freeform manner doesn't really match the forced English mistakes in conversations that were often portrayed in people's uploads.
2965160	2970040	Is this the only possible explanation? No, but it's not something that's ever been dispelled.
2970040	2976760	There was a brief comment from Misaki on Twitter during the situation, claiming that he needed staff to help translate a response to someone,
2976760	2981720	whose I'm not sure, but it was attempting to maintain that character, but people were not convinced.
2981720	2988040	I think that the whole ordeal just ruined the image of Misaki so much that people didn't really know who he even was.
2988040	2992200	Even if he couldn't speak perfect English, his whole demeanour was still pulled into question,
2992200	2997560	his conduct was a far cry from what had been expected of him, because he was seen as this community figure,
2997560	3002120	and because he was seen as this community figure, he was going to be held to community standards,
3002120	3006360	especially given that his stick was this innocent, wholesome man.
3006360	3009000	Very few YouTubers who had previously worked with Misaki,
3009000	3015720	given him their time, and entertained their quirky conversations, were likely going to be interested in rekindling that relationship,
3015720	3018520	because it undermined the person who they had come to know.
3018520	3023880	It also ended the potential for future relationships on this basis, because it undermined the punchlines.
3023880	3030360	Jokes like these, as unamusing as they were to me, were based on the sincere naivety of Misaki's character.
3030360	3035560	If you have an interaction with knowledge that it's all just an act, it doesn't make the misunderstandings funny,
3035560	3041960	because it doesn't take a comedy genius to change spam to sperm, it's only really funny when the person isn't aware.
3041960	3047960	With this in mind, Samurai Buyer were basically relegated to another company with no real outstanding qualities,
3047960	3049640	but it wasn't even that.
3049640	3055080	Because of the persisting stigma left by the controversy, they can't really bring back the character,
3055080	3060920	and any other promotional campaign conducted on YouTube to people who were familiar would seem out of character.
3060920	3064040	Their relationships with YouTubers was mostly at an end.
3064040	3069400	I have to admit, however, I don't really feel overly bad for any YouTubers who merely collaborated with Samurai Buyer
3069400	3073160	under the pretense that they were talking with this friendly Japanese man,
3073160	3077000	because it was a pretty naive assumption to make on their behalf in the first place.
3077000	3081880	Such an innocent image is something that would have been hard to maintain naturally for over a year,
3081880	3086440	because surely at some point it's gonna clock that they should improve their linguistic skills,
3086440	3091960	and the experience of talking to other people with English as their first language would have helped them improve anyway.
3091960	3096600	This persona would have been pretty difficult to maintain naturally, given its fame.
3096600	3102360	The perception people always had when they imagined Misaki was almost like this one man show at Samurai Buyer,
3102360	3106040	because it's the only real way that such a business would have been able to work.
3106040	3112920	Misaki's whole existence became inherently counterintuitive, and people entertained it because it was fun.
3113080	3120040	I think creators just saw it through a very narrow, optimistic lens, based on stereotypes they had formulated in their head,
3120040	3125480	and they probably jumped to the comedic potential rather than considering the likelihood of this persona.
3125480	3129960	Do I blame them for that? No. I can see myself easily doing the same thing,
3129960	3134760	but I don't think it's some huge deception on that front, it's just a bit of a letdown,
3134760	3141960	but that letdown ultimately harmed Samurai Buyer more than any YouTuber, so is it not them we should feel sorry for?
3142040	3143240	Well, not really.
3151800	3157880	In the Spongebob Squarepants movie, there's a scene where our protagonists try to purchase ice cream from a sweet old vendor lady,
3157880	3161320	yet something isn't quite right. This scene may not intend to be,
3161320	3167320	but it's a good representation of how one's focus on the ideal can sometimes distract us from the reality.
3167320	3174040	Credit where credit's due, Samurai Buyer employed a bold marketing strategy which paid its dues for a substantial amount of time,
3174040	3178360	but ultimately, when said marketing strategy is based on a level of deception,
3178360	3185320	you always risk a loss of trust when it is revealed, even if it is something that perhaps people should've worked out anyway.
3185320	3190840	In a way, if Samurai Buyer had revealed it themselves, we may have all been able to have a laugh about it to move on,
3190840	3196360	but the circumstances under which this information was released couldn't be more ironic if it tried to be.
3196360	3203080	Masaki, and perhaps some of the members at Samurai Buyer, maintained a character that was given support and attention
3203080	3208840	due to his perceived innocence and blind kindness. It relied on people's sympathy and acceptance,
3208840	3213160	even if it was from a somewhat condescending position on the YouTuber's behalf.
3213160	3219880	With that in mind, when they encountered someone in a similar position, they should've at least understood the fundamental conditions
3219880	3224040	that drive us to do the right things in those situations with those people,
3224040	3227880	because they were taking advantage of those exact sentiments from YouTubers,
3227880	3233640	and yet when their new employee, who was in a country that he didn't know, with a language that he didn't speak,
3233640	3239560	perhaps slightly naively, when they should've shown a bit of sympathy, they neglected that mantra.
3239560	3244760	It's hard to know exactly what occurred, but to me, it seems that after leading someone on,
3244760	3250440	they sacked him for reasons they've continuously changed, and then proceeded to taunt him while he was in distress.
3250440	3256280	Just the thought of that couldn't be more antithetical to the persona that Masaki had constructed.
3256280	3261000	This doesn't mean that the narratives were perfect, I think the Twitlong was flawed, it was overdramatic,
3261000	3265720	and it appears that Merry was heading out to Japan regardless, though I assume the extension wasn't planned.
3265720	3269800	Nonetheless, it seems somewhat misframed in the Twitlong, and he was criticised for it.
3269800	3275000	However, he also ended up being subject to some pretty rotten narratives which were completely unsubstantiated,
3275000	3279400	including claims that he had acted out in the office, which were retracted when the guy making them
3279400	3283240	admitted he had barely worked at the company. There's a good Reddit interaction that occurred
3283240	3288280	where you can see these two arguments. Unfortunately, even if you saw the flaws in the claimant's statement,
3288280	3293080	it didn't alter the experiences they appeared to be rooted in, and the fact that Samurai Buyer had altered
3293080	3297640	their explanation multiple times made it look like they were struggling to justify an ill-founded
3297640	3303320	dismissal, and subsequent vicious, malicious derision. Once the news broke, and they finally
3303320	3308040	realised this was impacting their reputation, they changed their tune, but not by bringing back the
3308040	3313560	old friendly face of Misaki, no, that was already in the past. They went into full corporate mode,
3313560	3317960	threatening legal action against Merryweather, and anyone who spoke ill of them. They persisted
3317960	3322760	this campaign against creators who uploaded videos on the matter, even uploads which didn't receive
3322760	3327400	the most traffic, the ones that were basically barebones reaction videos. I honestly think that
3327400	3332120	most of these threats didn't carry much weight, but it also seems a fair few creators were aware
3332120	3335800	that their narratives were slightly misguided, particularly the one regarding the fraudulent
3335800	3340920	nature of their site. As I said right at the start, how they format payments is a tad novel,
3340920	3345160	and I can see how it could have been misleading, however, I do not think their site is structured
3345160	3350280	to intentionally scam people, although certain stories such as the leftover returns being placed
3350280	3355400	in loot boxes may well be true. When you're accusing a company of scamming, I can see how that would
3355400	3360360	place you on shaky ground if you didn't have the evidence to back up those claims, so I also think
3360360	3364920	that self-doubt on the behalf of creators probably played into the outcome of this being mostly
3364920	3369560	removed from the internet, and to be fair, that's a reasonable justification. It does seem that some
3369560	3374040	narratives with less substantiation were caught amongst the stronger ones. Nonetheless, given
3374040	3378920	their legal team were about as competent as the Mr. Misaki sales persona, it just looked like a
3378920	3383880	desperate attempt to eradicate the existence of the instant, so I'll take a moment to set the record
3383880	3388760	straight. I don't think Samurai Buyer is a scam website, I don't think they're gonna run off with
3388760	3393400	your money into the sunset and you will not receive your product. If you wanna order from them,
3393400	3398040	go for it. This obviously does not invalidate any legitimate complaints that people have,
3398040	3402680	and there were issues with how they presented certain information. However, I think this problem
3402680	3407560	has been mostly resolved, and they currently offer ways to approximate shipping fees on the basis of
3407560	3412920	predictive package specifications. On top of this, much of their behaviour could be chalked up to
3412920	3418280	basic corporation standards. I'm sure that it's not unheard of for a company to lay off a foreign
3418280	3423080	employee who they feel like they've used up, and can probably get away with dismissing, and I'm sure
3423320	3428120	YouTubers have collaborated with corporations who've done far worse things than Samurai Buyer,
3428120	3432040	I want to make that clear. However, they can get away with it because they don't attach a
3432040	3437240	personality to their brand, nor do they ingratiate themselves into the community as this benevolent
3437240	3442280	friend to all. When Samurai Buyer did that with Misaki, they lost the privilege of distance,
3442280	3446440	especially for Misaki himself, whose childish antics in the situation were that which not even
3446440	3451720	a corporation would typically stoop to due to the sheer insensitivity and terrible optics. This was
3451800	3456360	what jeopardised relationships, especially that with iDubbbz, one of their biggest cheerleaders,
3456360	3460840	who Samurai Buyer literally used to promote this job opening. I wouldn't be surprised if Ian
3460840	3465400	genuinely felt bad for promoting it in the first place, and hell, there was certainly no way that
3465400	3470040	he was ever working with them again. It was awkward for anyone who had promoted the narrative about
3470040	3474840	this sweet, naive Japanese man after the situation, now that someone from the community was actually
3474840	3480120	screwed over, but as said I didn't blame them, it was easy to miss. The stupid thing is, if Samurai
3480120	3484600	Buyer hadn't intimidated Meriwether and others, they probably could have found a middle ground
3484600	3489640	resolution which the public recognised, and both sides endorsed, where some of the inaccuracies
3489640	3494040	were rolled back on. Instead, by threatening legal action and causing an immediate removal
3494040	3498600	from someone who seemed frenzied and panicked to online onlookers, no one actually believed
3498600	3503080	their attraction was sincere, and it just made them look like corporate bullies. People aren't
3503080	3508200	idiots, and they are sensitive to these circumstances. Samurai Buyer wasn't, and that was
3508200	3513800	what undermined any humanity people thought they had. Since the situation, Samurai Buyer have
3513800	3517880	maintained their narrative, and although I can understand their annoyance at certain claims,
3517880	3522200	I still feel like they're missing perspective. Many of their tweets from their old account have
3522200	3526600	fallen into the suspension of bits, however they still receive questions about the situation on
3526600	3531160	their new one from time to time, and they have continued to attack Merry, including calling him
3531160	3536680	bitter, butthurt, and even racist, which is pretty ludicrous given the standard set by Misaki.
3537320	3546360	Misaki recently tried to contact me a lot saying how he wants to do a couple of voice calls with
3546360	3550600	me, unfortunately I never responded, and I'm actually too much of a pussy to talk in voice
3550600	3554520	chat with Misaki. This isn't to say that I necessarily think this is the most egregious
3554520	3558680	content, though the black face is pretty unpalatable, but they set the standard for
3558680	3563400	edgy humour in your marketing, and unless someone was actively tweeting out hate content, for which
3563400	3567160	they probably would have been immensely reprimanded for, then I don't believe that such
3567160	3571800	a claim is remotely fair. You'd think that after seeming so upset about being called scammers,
3571800	3577640	they'd understand not to throw out such flagrant terminology, but oh well, an eye for an eye I
3577640	3581640	guess. Misaki has since supposedly left the company and moved on to greener pastures,
3581640	3586040	so any comments are unlikely to be coming from Misaki himself now, but if they're gonna maintain
3586040	3589880	that point of view, I don't think they should do that without a bit of challenge. However,
3589880	3594520	that's far from the main intent behind this video, which is more a cautionary one.
3594520	3599320	The Misaki character had limited gimmicks, and yet he basically found a cheat code to bypass
3599320	3603560	a lot of complex judgements we would typically make when considering collaborations, even if it
3603560	3608200	was accidental. It allowed him to basically be a social comedian, moving between YouTuber
3608200	3612600	conversations and adapting to their style, sometimes to uncomfortable degrees. If anyone
3612600	3616840	else had done this, it would have seemed quite disingenuous, and yet people gave it a pass because
3616920	3621400	we assumed it was some sweet foreign man trying to fit in with our little YouTube project.
3621400	3625800	Samurai Buyer then often sent over items that catered to the individual creator, whether that
3625800	3630520	was Pokemon plushies for Jayden, or stuffed female legs for Filthy Frank. It made them think that
3630520	3636680	Mr Misaki, in all of his naivety, still cared about their interests, how sweet, but they were
3636680	3641240	just part of the plan. Eventually that more cutthroat corporate side showed, and everyone
3641240	3645960	was shocked, but like the Spongebob Squarepants scene, sometimes you gotta look out for the bigger
3645960	3650520	fish. The message I'll conclude on is that it's worth being careful about the assumptions you
3650520	3655720	make based on a person's lack of technical skills, it doesn't necessarily reflect their character,
3655720	3660760	especially if the person's an adult with decent social ability elsewhere. Your sympathy can easily
3660760	3665800	be exploited, and eventually you, or someone else, finds out the hard way. The moment you think
3665800	3671000	someone can do no wrong, is the moment you probably underestimate them. That's not to be paranoid,
3671640	3676440	just cautious. Samurai Buyer was the business that got to have a human face for a bit,
3676440	3681080	and as a fun little novelty, I suppose it can tell us a little, and makes for at least an
3681080	3685960	interesting tale, but as a trend in a world where we already have more than enough brands trying
3685960	3690920	to infiltrate the human mind, I think I like this Pinocchio better off hollow.
3695800	3700520	So yes, that was the video, I hope you enjoyed, I am an absolute mess right now,
3700520	3705320	and I'm probably gonna go take a shower, have a rest, because that was a bit more taxing than
3705320	3710920	I expected it to be. Quite a dense video, with a lot of words in sentences. I wanna give a big
3710920	3714840	thanks to my editors, once again I'm sure they have done a fantastic job, please go and check
3714840	3720440	them out, I will leave them in the pinned comments. I also wanna give a big shoutout to my Patreons,
3720440	3724680	once again $10 Patreons being shown on screen right now, and also wanna give a big thanks to
3724680	3732280	my $50 Patreons, Hypercube, Samhala Baloo, Amanda, and Caroline, as well as my $100 Patreons,

3737800	3743240	it means the world, and it keeps my head up in these times, in these crazy times, so much
3743240	3747880	appreciated. I don't have too much else to add, if you wanna fire me, my social medias will be in
3747880	3753240	the pinned comment too, though I have been on a bit of a break from them, but if you wanna try,
3753240	3757880	there they are, and, I don't know what else to say, just, thanks again,
3757880	3761800	for all your support guys, take care, I'll see you in the next one.
