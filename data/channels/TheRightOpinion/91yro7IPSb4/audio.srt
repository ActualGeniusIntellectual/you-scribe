00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:23,680
Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time and image.

2
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,960
It's something that a fair few people seem to care about.

3
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:32,400
And understandably so, in our communities there's nothing wrong with a bit of reputation conservation,

4
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:37,960
particularly if that aids your standing amongst others. Image can be reflected in our demeanor, our actions,

5
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:42,400
our comments, and equally, it will be defined by how people interpret that behaviour.

6
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:48,560
When we encounter human beings and other alike entities, we spend a lot of time trying to paint a mental picture

7
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,520
in our head for how we envision them.

8
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:55,760
Now, we cannot look into their minds and read their every intention, but some judgement is always necessary

9
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:01,360
because we have to make a decision which may involve bestowing responsibility or trust in certain people

10
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:05,000
down the line, and that mental picture has to be factored in.

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
However, this is typically reserved for personal relationships, and although we may hold greater opinions

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,400
about certain issues, we won't typically assign a face to it. This is particularly the case with corporations,

13
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:20,440
now it's completely valid to have distaste for corporations and their conduct, but it's also reasonable to accept

14
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:25,800
that most companies are made up of a lot of interacting tiers, and this can lead to them being pretty much

15
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:30,680
separated from the idea of consciousness altogether. Although I wouldn't actually agree with that and urge

16
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:35,920
others to keep in mind that a decision will typically have a person behind it, it is often hard to conceptually

17
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:41,640
feel any emotional connection to what a company may do. Hell, if we did that, we'd probably never stop being

18
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,080
upset, and we do need to look out for our mental wellbeing too, you know.

19
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:51,800
YouTube occupies a weird medium between the world of intimacy and distance, because although we may not feel

20
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:57,480
a connection to a lot of creators on a personal level, their success partly relies on the direct support that we

21
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:02,720
pledge towards them. A lot of celebrities feel a bit beyond our world, and YouTube creates communities that

22
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:08,280
people can be involved in, however, because of that, there is a bit more direct accountability, and a judgment

23
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:13,920
that does feel a little more personal. Therefore, we tend to apply certain standards for creators that we may not

24
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:20,360
give to large multinational corporations, partly because of that connection, and partly because we actually

25
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:25,680
have the power to hold them accountable. Over the last few years, we've witnessed companies attempt to be quote

26
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,760
woke, and relate to this human condition, yet it never feels particularly real because although amusing,

27
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:36,080
you receive the impression it's just another campaign focused towards a demographic of depressed teenagers

28
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,800
who occupy the Twitter hellscape. On top of this, the tweets are never really channeled through the mind of an

29
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,840
individual, and therefore we never put a face on the company or develop a personal connection.

30
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:52,880
However, in 2015, a business managed to infiltrate a then budding YouTube community through a character who

31
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:58,160
would become almost synonymous with the product that he was offering. Yes, long before the BetterHelp scandal

32
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:02,960
would cause many creators to re-evaluate how they keep an eye on sponsors they collaborate with, there was an

33
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:08,720
even more bewildering controversy surrounding one of the most iconic YouTube sponsors, Samurai Buyer.

34
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:14,320
Samurai, Samurai, Samurai, Samurai, Samurai Buyer.

35
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:20,560
Samurai Buyer is an online proxy buyer slash delivery service, which on first impressions wouldn't have the most

36
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:26,440
applicable market potential in the YouTube environment, particularly in unboxing content, which was the main

37
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:32,640
genre they were engaged in. However, this is where we introduce a man named Misaki, a now former representative

38
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:38,080
and marketing manager of the brand in question. In communication, he seemed to be an oblivious Japanese

39
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:43,360
gentleman attempting to sell merchandise to the western world with your happiness at heart. Brought to

40
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,800
stardom by his appearance on iDubbbz's Bad & Boxing series, he became renowned for his unassuming demeanour,

41
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:54,560
broken English, and habit of appropriating phrases in a rather unflattering, yet precious fashion.

42
00:03:54,800 --> 00:04:10,320
Over the next one and a half years, the Samurai Buyer brand would expand their scope in working with multiple

43
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:16,640
YouTube personalities from across communities, capitalising on this reputation, while Misaki obtained a unique

44
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:22,320
status amongst creators and their audiences as a culturally sheltered, yet conscientious and enthusiastic

45
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:28,720
gentleman with the interests of his western friends as his utmost priority. In many ways, he became the face of

46
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:34,160
the brand, involved in a platform that treated him with the personal nature that he treated creators.

47
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:47,200
It was so, so wholesome, but was it too wholesome? In the world where corporate and personal become one,

48
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:52,400
the heavens will collide with the earth, and at the end of the spectacle, corporations and creators alike

49
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,800
realised why they were probably better off in different worlds.

50
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:03,280
Yesterday, my friends, is a story of deception, exploitation, and intimidation, with a side of legal fries,

51
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,680
and with that level of dramatic potential, you'd expect there to be a comprehensive backlog of creators

52
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:13,440
covering the situation, however due to reasons that we'll discuss later, the landscape otherwise seems sparse,

53
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,640
many of these videos having vanished from where they once were. Until recently, I was barely aware of this

54
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:24,800
situation, and under the impression that Misaki had merely honourably faded into obscurity, it appears that I was

55
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:31,360
wrong. Well today, we're attempting to fill that gap with as much information as I could find, some spicy storytelling,

56
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:36,880
and some hot takes for a cold case. It's been a while since we stepped in the YouTube time machine, and for people

57
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:42,720
who weren't there, you may not even be aware of the troubled legacy of a man and a business, but on principle,

58
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:49,200
appeared to encompass some of the purest qualities of YouTube culture. However, as a wise man once said,

59
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:57,200
expectations are for losers. Does that mean there's a story to tell? Oh yes it does, so I suggest we get right to it.

60
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,920
I guess the first specific question to answer is, what is Samurai Buyer? What sort of service do they offer?

61
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:11,520
Well, it's a delivery service, however the business doesn't hold stock themselves, what they tend to do is

62
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:17,040
purchase content that can be typically purchased in Japanese domains, ship it to their warehouse, and then

63
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:22,640
facilitate transportation of these goods which may otherwise be inhibited by international restrictions

64
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:29,200
on those specific sites. Typically this is related to online shopping, however these services also extends to

65
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:34,640
auctions, which sounds pretty fun if I'm to be honest. Because of their set up, you will probably be charged at

66
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:40,240
two separate points for the service, once for the items cost when you make the purchase, and then for the cost

67
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:46,240
of shipping once it's arrived at their warehouse with the weight and size measured. It's a curious system,

68
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:51,680
but I suppose it's one that makes sense. Samurai Buyer's about page doesn't really have much information

69
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:57,280
about their origins, it much more focuses on their features and the benefits of using their services.

70
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:02,640
This isn't a criticism, but given their lack of information elsewhere, how Samurai Buyer came into being

71
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:07,200
may appear to be a bit of an enigma. However, it would not surprise you to know that its existence

72
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:13,280
preceded its presence in YouTube communities. The first archives of the old site, SamuraiBuyer.jp,

73
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:18,640
appeared towards the end of 2014. In fact, this old article announcing the launch of Samurai Buyer

74
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:24,400
was published on the 14th of November 2014, which can give us a pretty strong grip on when it was

75
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:30,080
established. It was launched by the Bushido Corporation headed by Yasuhiro Tanaka, who was already

76
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:35,520
operating a similar service known as the Taobao Shinkansen, which helped deliver Chinese products to

77
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:41,120
those in Japan, the Taobao being a reference to the popular Chinese shopping website, and the Shinkansen

78
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,840
being a reference to the Japanese bullet train, symbolising their speedy service, I assume.

79
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:50,960
With the success of this venture, Bushido clearly sought to reapply the formula on a larger scale,

80
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:57,600
this time signalling intent to export Japanese items to China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and the United States.

81
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:02,160
In the first few months, this venture was well received, with another article being published in

82
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:08,480
March of 2015 proudly proclaiming that over 110,000 users had visited their websites before

83
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:13,680
and after the new year. However, the article focused on success predominantly within China,

84
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,680
and if we recall, in the previous article, we would have noted that they seemed to have their

85
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,480
sites set on the United States, however, there were a few key problems that were likely hindering

86
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:27,680
their progress in these markets. Now, we could talk about the lack of prestige, or the already

87
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:32,640
existent competition from within, but another significant problem was the language barrier.

88
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:39,120
Samurai Buyer had a website. This website did have an English language option, however, it was not the

89
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,600
most fluent. If you were browsing the web looking to purchase some foreign goods, and encountered

90
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:48,720
this website, which appears to possess the English skills of a spam email, it may not fill you with

91
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:54,720
the most confidence in their ability to deliver. Here are some of the examples.

92
00:08:54,720 --> 00:09:01,360
The word of samurai is a symbol of Japan, but widely well known in the word. It is essential that

93
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:07,200
using Japanese when you purchase at Japanese online shops, and less shop support for English one,

94
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:14,000
our special staffs will assist you even though you cannot speak Japanese. These are my favourites,

95
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,120
but jokes aside, this poor grip with the English language is something that pervaded their website,

96
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:24,160
and would probably make any anglophone think twice about spending their hard earned cash on

97
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:28,560
such a convenience. So over the next few months, they worked on the linguistic flaws,

98
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:33,760
eventually creating a more accessible and trustworthy site. However, it was still a bit clunky

99
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:38,400
and unconvincing. Add this to other issues, and it was probable that they weren't quite performing

100
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:43,440
up to the level they were aspiring for. Now, at this time, there were a lot of creators on YouTube

101
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:48,320
doing these unboxing videos, some of which were sponsored content, however, unlike a lot of

102
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:53,360
businesses involved in this enterprise, Samurai Buyer weren't actually offering dedicated loot

103
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:59,360
crates. Nonetheless, someone, maybe even Misaki himself, had the audacious yet relatively ingenious

104
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:04,000
idea that they could be a part of this, and instead of using the boxes to promote a product,

105
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,040
they could use it to promote their delivery service. Conceptually, it worked, in fact, it works

106
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:13,520
incredibly well, because whereas with loot boxes you are constrained to showcase content that will

107
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:17,920
be congruent with what you're offering commercially, with Samurai Buyer, they could practically put

108
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:22,720
anything in the box as long as it was something you could buy yourself on their website. This

109
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,360
meant they could cater to the YouTuber's interests and compel more positive reviews and

110
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,800
enthused endorsements. It's not exactly clear when they began contacting YouTubers with their

111
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:37,600
propositions, however, iDubbbz wasn't actually the first person to work with them. I can't say for

112
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:43,280
certain who was, but what I do know is that on the 6th of September 2015, just under a fortnight

113
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:48,560
before Samurai Buyer's first appearance on the iDubbbz channel, a creator by the name of TheAnimeMan

114
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,560
uploaded a video called Where Do You Buy Awesome Japanese Goodies?

115
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:39,280
In this video, he answers the titular question, stating that you can, in fact, buy awesome

116
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:43,840
Japanese goodies from this website known as Samurai Buyer. As a video, it doesn't really

117
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:48,800
stand out from standard sponsored content, and there are no details regarding their interaction

118
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:53,840
other than that he seems to be relatively familiar with them. On principle, it made sense for a

119
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:58,800
company based in Japan to reach out to content creators who have audiences more engaged with

120
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,280
Japanese culture, and would have a greater desire to purchase their goods, thus finding greater

121
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:08,640
utility within the website. TheAnimeMan's video was well received, and obtained an adequate number

122
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:13,440
of reviews. This may have satisfied Mizaki and the crew over at Samurai Buyer, who were probably

123
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,920
unsure of what to exactly expect from their sponsored content, however, it's doubtful that

124
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,680
they could have foreseen the fortunes that one of their next clients would bring them.

125
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,480
Let's talk about that interesting character.

126
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:32,880
2015 iDubbbz, a bygone era for sure. In fact, that whole period feels like a blur, and I wouldn't

127
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:37,520
blame anyone for not remembering that iDubbbz didn't actually have the most prosperous year,

128
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:42,480
it definitely picked up at the end, but a lot of it was spent obtaining steady, yet gradual growth.

129
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:47,280
Nonetheless, he was carving out a firm niche with content that carried a general appeal,

130
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:50,080
or defining his brand as an independent creator.

131
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,160
I'll put a link shield on my forehead.

132
00:12:53,840 --> 00:13:01,200
Hey ladies, do you like geek culture? Because I'm the biggest LoZ fan in the world.

133
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,960
I speedrun it, and I go best past the cuckoos.

134
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:11,040
By September 2015, iDubbbz had two main series which were held in relatively high esteem by his

135
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:16,000
audience, these were Kickstarter Craft and Bad Unboxing. The former is of little relevance,

136
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,400
the latter is what caught the attention of Samurai Buyer. The Bad Unboxing series had been

137
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:26,400
running since 2014, and consisted of our good friend Ian iDubbbz unboxing various items,

138
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:30,800
testing them, often in unorthodox fashion, and then delivering his verdict.

139
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:38,000
May the Triforce be with you. Oh my god. My brain is starting to hemorrhage a little bit.

140
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:43,200
Some of his content was just Ian opening up what he felt like, but in the months approaching the

141
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:48,560
Samurai Buyer saga, he had increased focus on loot crates, and methods of destroying their content.

142
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:54,080
Nonetheless, these videos did receive a consistent number of views, and retained a dedicated fanbase.

143
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:58,960
Now iDubbbz's channel wasn't exclusively Japanophilic, god, what an ugly word,

144
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:03,600
but regardless, he had exhibited interest in Japanese culture, and previously advertised

145
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:08,400
products from the nation. Whether this factored into Samurai Buyer's decision to approach Mr.

146
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:14,160
iDubbbz is another question, but they clearly saw an opportunity to win over some new buyers of

147
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:19,440
the Samurai. To a sponsor, probably one of the most attractive features of iDubbbz's content

148
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:24,400
is that he wasn't created defined by the topics he was covering, it was carried by his distinct

149
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:28,960
persona, which meant that there was a level of security in the traffic that he would receive,

150
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:34,240
even if it was the most unappealing topic, like some sponsored uploads are. This is probably why

151
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,640
a lot of sponsors worked with iDubbbz in spite of his relatively modest size at the time,

152
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:44,080
he elevated the content by being able to apply his natural self and provided promotion,

153
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,960
even if he wasn't always the most complimentary.

154
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:51,440
iDubbbz, I can't believe you burned your subscriber plaque and also put guacamole on your

155
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:57,040
Triforce Be With You t-shirt. I can't believe it. I'm gonna throw in the trash now. I'm not even

156
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,720
gonna wash it. I could wash it easily. It would take two f***ing seconds, but you know what I'm

157
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,320
gonna do? I'm gonna throw in the trash. Wanna know why? Because I don't give a f***.

158
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:09,680
Now although the English on the Samurai Buyer website was passable, what a handsome man by the

159
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:15,280
way, their social media posts indicated that they may still lack the necessary proficiency to operate

160
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:20,960
a particularly successful PR campaign. However, with intrepid, slightly misplaced confidence,

161
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:26,080
they proceeded to connect with Ian and arrange their first collaboration, uploaded on the 16th

162
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:32,400
of September 2015. Today we're gonna be unboxing some P.O. Box packages, these three are sent to me

163
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:37,600
I think by fans, not exactly sure. The fourth one here was sent to me by a good friend that I met

164
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:43,360
a couple weeks ago, his name is Misaki. In this video, Samurai Buyer didn't occupy the whole

165
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:48,000
review, as the limelight was shared with some other fan mail. However, iDubbbz appeared to take

166
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,800
an immediate liking to the product shared with him, some of which appealed to his more destructive,

167
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,800
even masochistic tendencies.

168
00:15:54,800 --> 00:16:01,440
You sent me the good stuff Misaki, I don't, I know I don't have as many nerve endings on my foot, but

169
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:10,160
you know. Oh Misaki, Misaki, Misaki, please don't hurt me, please don't hurt me Misaki, I do not want this.

170
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:17,280
Oh shit, I almost bit my tongue off. Misaki? More like Mishaki.

171
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:22,560
However, this was only half the appeal, the other half being the interaction with Misaki.

172
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:28,640
My name is Misaki from Japan, I am watching your movie on YouTube and want you to introduce my

173
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:32,640
Japanese products on your channel, please let me know if you're interested.

174
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:37,520
Now in many environments, this sort of email would have been dismissed as spam, but iDubbbz chose to

175
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:42,720
entertain it, firstly because he's an entertainer, and even if nothing had come of it, it would have

176
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:47,360
made for an amusing story, and secondly, someone's offering to send you goods for free. The worst

177
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,280
thing that can happen is that they don't send you the produce, or they send you something rather

178
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:55,920
unpleasant, which iDubbbz may well have preferred to be honest. In his book, it was a win-win.

179
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:01,040
In the exchange that follows, Misaki appears to unknowingly win over the affection of iDubbbz and

180
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:05,840
his viewers. Yes, I would love to make a video for your products, send me the craziest stuff you have,

181
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:11,440
samurai swords, body pillows, whatever you want. Okay, I will, and may I know your real name and

182
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,760
also phone number which require for shipment?

183
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:18,960
So let's break down this defining conversation. A person who we assume to be Misaki reaches out

184
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:23,840
in broken English, which although unprofessional on a website, can be rather endearing in

185
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:28,800
conversation. In this instance, one can assume it's because of inexperience, but we tend to conflate

186
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:34,400
this with stereotypes of innocence and naivety. It's also quite amusing, I used those delightful

187
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:39,040
quotes earlier for comedic purposes, but combined with the other conditions, it can enable some

188
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:44,800
pretty exquisite meme potential. However, the job was not done for Misaki. In rather typical iDubbbz

189
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:49,360
fashion, Ian employs some offensive language in communicating with Misaki, particularly in

190
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,160
addressing him.

191
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,760
Ian- Have you got the parcel yet?

192
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,680
Misaki- Not yet, I'll check it tomorrow.

193
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:58,480
Now, Misaki could rebuff this or break off communication altogether, but he absorbs it,

194
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,960
and then uses it to further self-deprecate himself. In these positions, it brings a lot of

195
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:07,760
personality to the conversation. It's this guy, trying to hold a discussion on the level with

196
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:12,000
iDubbbz, but not quite getting there. It's funny, and it's cutesy.

197
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,520
Ian- My bad, yellow man, I got the package today, I can't wait to open it.

198
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:20,160
Equally, however, it establishes a firm bond between the sponsor and the client. You'll see the

199
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:25,200
term Misaki, and Samurai Buyer often used interchangeably. Now, technically speaking, they

200
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:30,080
are very different entities. Misaki is merely the representative of a much larger business,

201
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:35,280
because the job of sponsored videos is to focus on the product, Misaki's personality became an

202
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:40,720
asset to the product itself. Misaki's personality put a face on the company, and that's not often

203
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:45,840
done for many reasons, many of which will be revealed in due time. However, for the moment,

204
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:50,880
Misaki was like that out of touch grandad trying to be cool, but in a way, the failure was just as

205
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,360
captivating, and this four minute appearance outlined the start of a beautiful and fortuitous

206
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,720
relationship, one that seemed to only blossom over the coming years.

207
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:14,560
After the success of Samurai Buyer's first appearance on the iDubbbz channel, both parties

208
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:19,440
seemed eager to work together again, and just over two weeks later, iDubbbz uploaded another

209
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:25,040
Bad Unboxing, this time committing his undivided attention to the contents of Misaki's care package.

210
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:30,240
Hello everyone, and welcome back to another episode of Bad Unboxing Samurai Buyer Edition.

211
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,960
On the last episode of Samurai Buyer Unboxing, we took a look at a lot of products that Misaki

212
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:40,640
sent us, and some products that Misaki didn't send us. From now on, anything sent by Misaki,

213
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:45,200
or Samurai Buyer as a whole, we're gonna unbox on its own. We're also gonna take a look at what

214
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:50,320
Misaki's feedback was on the previous video. iDubbbz also discloses their dialogue following

215
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:54,480
the initial upload, which appears to have devolved since their previous conversation.

216
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,800
Now, it's point blank offensive humour without too much depth to it, however, one thing that you

217
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:04,480
could observe is the building of a rapport between iDubbbz and Misaki. Misaki appears to mould himself

218
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:10,000
around the conversation, he reached out originally with a rather ordinary email. The only detail one

219
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,880
could observe was the linguistic deficit, and as iDubbbz applied his rather signature style of

220
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:20,320
humour, Misaki seemed to adapt. By the end of their second email, our Samurai representative

221
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:25,280
appeared to be innovating with this humour, often once again to rather painful outcomes

222
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:30,240
in my opinion, including referring to Japan as the Yellow Island. Now, with jokes like this,

223
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,400
which would be considered somewhat distasteful by many, you might receive the impression that

224
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:39,120
he doesn't entirely know what he actually means, and his lack of awareness is what many would find

225
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:44,160
amusing. But remember that Misaki was the person to refer to this in the first place, which means

226
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:49,280
he's likely making some active effort to appeal to iDubbbz's humour, including making some statements

227
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,440
which may arouse one's suspicion.

228
00:20:51,440 --> 00:21:12,080
Misaki's English may not have been immaculate, but I do think he had a grip on the effect of

229
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:17,040
such a comment, in fact even iDubbbz was mildly suspicious as to the identity behind this

230
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:29,920
character. However, it was another successful video, with iDubbbz reacting to the items with

231
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:33,280
a degree of elation and dare I say it, emotion.

232
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:53,040
Over the next few months, they would cultivate a strong working relationship with unique

233
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:57,680
assortments of items, accompanied by a presentation which would raise a few eyebrows elsewhere,

234
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:03,120
but not on the 2015 iDubbbz channel, no they were right at home here. As I mentioned earlier,

235
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:08,000
towards the end of 2015, iDubbbz began to experience substantial growth, and as I also

236
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:13,200
mentioned, Ian's content often had a peel which was transcended of the topics. The other facet

237
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:18,000
that became incredibly beneficial for Ian was his strong production value and consistent brand,

238
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,960
it gave his older content a lot of rewatch value for new audiences, and this led to cumulative

239
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:27,920
views on previous uploads, which in turn yielded their promotion on the YouTube algorithm.

240
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:32,480
At this point, Samurai Buyer had become a bit of a running meme on iDubbbz's channel, we spoke

241
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:37,600
about the image he garnered earlier, but it was like this hilarious naivete. Misaki demonstrated

242
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:42,000
a very surface level grip on language and personality, which allowed iDubbbz to often

243
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,280
control the conversation with a level of irony, and exploit Misaki's inexperience in a rather

244
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:51,680
underhanded fashion. Now this could be seen as quite mean spirited, but because iDubbbz didn't

245
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:56,000
do it in a way which directly put Misaki down, or even portrayed the language barrier as this

246
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,800
inherent disadvantage, and more as grounds for comedic potential, people enjoyed it.

247
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:05,760
Ian's happy, Misaki's happy, who would break up such a happy home?

248
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:11,200
Well, although iDubbbz and Misaki had become their own power couples, Samurai Buyer was still focused

249
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:15,840
on acquiring publicity from across the YouTube spectrum. Their collaboration with iDubbbz was

250
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:20,160
a blessing for sure, but it was a mixed blessing, because although their appearance on Ian's channel

251
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:24,000
would almost certainly increase their chances of landing future collaborations with similar

252
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,560
creators, it also placed them in a rather awkward dilemma regarding their reputation.

253
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:33,600
Now normally, linguistic proficiency is something that you would want to be improved upon experience

254
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:38,000
and budget, something that a company like Samurai Buyer would definitely have the resources to

255
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,640
accomplish, but in this instance, Misaki's poor English became so associated with the brand,

256
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:47,120
that people harbored this expectation they would receive the same treatment, even if it was

257
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:52,000
distinctly unprofessional. It was more entertaining, and it set them apart from other businesses.

258
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,000
It was this enshrined meme status, and they were going to make the most of it.

259
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,080
I knew that from iDubbbz's video that he messed around with Misaki a little bit, but I think I

260
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,920
took it to the next level and made him fall in love with me. I'll open the box in a second, Misaki,

261
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:06,160
just I want to share everyone the emails because they're funny.

262
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:11,520
Throughout 2016, a large majority of Samurai Buyer videos were replicated in iDubbbz's format,

263
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:15,760
with the content sometimes being delegated to an even more secondary position than the

264
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:20,560
email interactions. In Jade Animation's videos, she spends just under 10 minutes talking about

265
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:25,600
their interaction before reviewing the products. It makes sense in her format, but it is a testament

266
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:31,040
to how much of a force of personality Mr Misaki was considered to be, with him leaving a lasting

267
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:34,160
positive impression on many of the creators he collaborated with.

268
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:50,160
This was the consensus. It was a sense of innocence that seemed to pervade his attitude,

269
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:54,560
even if people did solicit humour from the interactions they shared with him. In many ways,

270
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:59,920
his attempt to understand another culture beyond him appealed to people's innate senses of sympathy

271
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:04,800
and warmth. How could you not help this modest Japanese man looking for a little promotion for

272
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:11,120
his service from the big YouTuber Senpai? All he wants to do is help all you weeaboos out there.

273
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:37,520
All these creators played along like it was some funny little in-joke, but in less than two years,

274
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:42,720
Samurai Buyer had unleashed its market potential, not just in the United States, but all across the

275
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:47,200
Western Hemisphere, bolstered by the image of its eccentric representative who had won over the

276
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:53,200
hearts of his clients. However, when success hinges on one person's image, does failure not as well?

277
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,680
Well, let's talk about it.

278
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:10,000
Towards the end of 2016, Samurai Buyer maintained their vigorous promotional campaign, and you

279
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,640
honestly wouldn't notice too much wrong. I did note one negative review on Reddit around September

280
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:19,360
time, but otherwise you'd be hard pressed to find any controversy. However, Misaki himself did seem

281
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,280
to be quite persistent at points.

282
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:28,560
Misaki- I just went on hiatus from Misaki for so long, he's really just been hitting me up over and over and over for months now.

283
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:34,160
So here you guys go, Samurai Buyer is back, and Misaki Dearest is shipping. Literally.

284
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:40,320
iDubbbz, who had not uploaded a Samurai Buyer-related video since March of 2016, then uploaded one in November,

285
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:43,120
which seemed to be slightly more cynical in its tone.

286
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:49,200
But Misaki's really been getting at my fucking nerves this past year, you know, always chatting my

287
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:56,000
ear off about dumb shit, wanting me to do things for him. And to prove that, I've stolen his gay logo,

288
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:04,240
and I put it on a sweatshirt, and any proceeds from selling these sweatshirts or shirts will go directly to me and not Misaki.

289
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,680
So fuck you, Misaki.

290
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:13,600
This led some to question whether iDubbbz actually had any vitriol towards Misaki, as the relationship was appearing to manifest into a more cruel affair.

291
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:20,240
Now, although there were some comments which did appear to be quite cutting in their nature, alongside one that I do intend to return to later,

292
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:25,280
if Ian was possessing any ill will, I doubt he would have given Samurai Buyer any attention at all,

293
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:30,080
including promotion for a new vacancy, which is where our story takes us next.

294
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:35,360
If you paid attention to that trainwreck of a conversation, you may have noticed there was some talk about a Google form,

295
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:42,080
that's just some shit Misaki wants me to promote for Samurai Buyer. I'll put it in the description, click it or don't,

296
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,080
send your sperm to him, I don't care.

297
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:51,040
In his Samurai Buyer video, alongside a rather cringe conversation where Misaki mistakes spams for sperm and such,

298
00:27:51,040 --> 00:28:00,320
glorious hijinks, Misaki informs iDubbbz he is hiring for a position, a person who is interested in anime content and has competence in social media marketing.

299
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:07,200
This was announced by iDubbbz and accompanied by an application form, however, because the iDubbbz fandom are predominantly shitposters,

300
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:14,640
and there had already been a hilarious sperm joke, most people just filled out the application under the denomination of Sperm, big funny.

301
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:20,560
However, there was one successful applicant, and this person was an individual by the name of Meriwether.

302
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:26,720
Meriwether is a creator slash producer who hails from Scandinavia, nowadays he's known for his work on anime girls,

303
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:30,720
but back then he was a community freshman looking for a way into the industry.

304
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:35,040
I prefaced that I bumped into the guy when working on another project, which didn't quite come to fruition,

305
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:41,680
but my personal impression has always been positive, and we are on good terms, though I note it may influence my interpretation of the situation,

306
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:44,400
I will do my best to present the differing perspectives.

307
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:50,320
Meriwether was a fan of iDubbbz, but unlike the rest of the Google form respondents, decided to take it seriously,

308
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:53,760
applying for the job being offered by the folks over at Samurai Buyer.

309
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:57,680
His application was successful, and he took up his job in this foreign land.

310
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:05,200
In January he tweeted out that he was working with Samurai Buyer on the social media front, covering their communications and social media.

311
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:12,240
Now, unfortunately, last year the original Samurai Buyer Twitter account was yeeted, so there's not too much that can be said regarding its interactions,

312
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:18,560
but as we know, there appeared to be no apparent conflict, or anything that would prime people's expectations for what was about to transpire.

313
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:24,720
In fact, it seems that Meriwether ran the Twitter account very successfully, and increased their follower count over tenfold.

314
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:33,280
For a few months, all was serene, but come April there was drama afoot, drama that would change the way people perceived Samurai Buyer and Misaki.

315
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:44,160
It was April the 22nd, a fine day for a Twitlonger, and boy oh boy did we receive one, one delivered by the now former Samurai Buyer employee, Meriwether.

316
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:52,880
In it, detailing his rather unpleasant experience with the assumedly harmless Misaki, and some very shocking revelations about the company and their marketing campaign.

317
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:57,680
Meriwether said that he had moved down to Tokyo after quitting his job to pursue a position at Samurai Buyer.

318
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:06,000
Now, after a successful stint managing their Twitter and encouragement from Misaki to extend his stay, Meriwether decided to move from Tokyo to their offices at Fukuoka.

319
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:13,120
However, all was not as imagined for Meriwether as the work environment didn't fulfil his expectations due to the rather unnerving atmosphere,

320
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:18,560
which made Meriwether in part accountable to Misaki's cold and distant behaviour, which played into his paranoia.

321
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:27,920
In spite of this, Meriwether states he worked on numerous successful projects, including an actual loot box about time, and achieved the company target set for him far ahead of schedule.

322
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:39,600
However, following the completion of these tasks, Meriwether decided to move back to Tokyo, so to feel more comfortable, at which point Misaki revoked all of Meriwether's social media account permissions and access to company related communications,

323
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:49,280
citing self-promotion as the reason he was fired, something which Meri immediately disputed, showing the contradictory narrative by a Skype user we assume to be Misaki.

324
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:55,040
Samurai Buyer would regularly change the reasons why he was fired, giving some the impression it was more personal.

325
00:30:55,040 --> 00:31:04,480
Meriwether also shows DMs of this user behaving rather mockingly towards him, including changing his profile picture to all the Scandinavian flags bar Denmark,

326
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:12,800
because Meriwether is from Denmark, and even threatening to call a lawyer at one point when another creator ceases their collaboration with him due to the dismissal,

327
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:16,080
because you know, people in this community care about others.

328
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:28,400
However, it doesn't end there, Meriwether notes the lexicon and responds to those who might excuse it due to Misaki's inexperience with the language, stating that Misaki is in fact highly westernised, even having resided in Australia for years.

329
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:40,080
What? Yes, we'll return to take a look at the verifiability of this story in due time, but Meriwether's account states that Misaki's persona was actually the result of him instructing an African employee to spam YouTubers,

330
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:48,480
only realising the potential when Eidos found amusement in the broken English. Once he has contact, he then proceeds to badger the creators for free promotions,

331
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:56,000
so he can maintain his position at the company and take a paid vacation to America, interesting detail but whatever floats your boat I guess.

332
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:04,240
Meriwether stated that he believed that Misaki's decision was based on how Misaki no longer saw use for Meriwether at the company, and although understanding of that reasoning,

333
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:11,440
still felt that Misaki's treatment of him was unjustified, given that Misaki was the person who encouraged Meriwether to extend his stay in Japan.

334
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:17,120
It seemed irresponsible at best, and downright malicious at worst, which is not what you really want to hear.

335
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:23,680
Additional claims were also made in the Twitlong about the service, including the assertion that they charge quote mystery fees for shipping,

336
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:31,680
and putting you in a position where you may end up paying extortionate delivery fees for modestly priced items, and although you can receive a refund for the shipping fee

337
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:37,920
because you've purchased it, you can't obtain a refund for the item, which would then be placed into one of their mystery boxes.

338
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:45,120
Basically, the allegation here is that Samurai Buyer structure corners the consumer into paying much more than they may initially assume,

339
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,840
which allowed Samurai Buyer to rip off their clients.

340
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:58,080
There's also further testimony about the way that Misaki behaved, the legality of the dismissal, and further adjuncts which served as supplementary responses to claims made by other parties involved.

341
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:05,280
But the core message was clear, Misaki was not who you, or nearly anybody, thought he was, and it didn't end there.

342
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:22,480
This Twitlonger did reasonably well at the time, it received a fair few likes and retweets, and although it never really went viral, it caught the attention of relevant parties,

343
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:28,080
such as iDubbbz, and fellow creators who may be considering a collaboration with Samurai Buyer in the future.

344
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:32,640
Loads of negative reviews were posted about their products and people's experiences with the website,

345
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:40,640
my favourite one being a rather disgruntled user who claimed that upon ordering a Samurai Buyer mystery box, received a decapitated toy gorilla.

346
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:47,280
Now, I cannot possibly comment on the actuality of such an anecdote, but it should show where people stood in the moment.

347
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:53,600
Misaki may not be the business, but he was the face, and when the face was smited, so was the business.

348
00:33:53,600 --> 00:34:01,120
I'd also add that there was a whole other drama that this spawned, which continued the rest of the year that includes another rabbit hole going to much darker places,

349
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:08,480
where Misaki's involvement was vague. Maybe that'll be for another time, but now we'll focus on where people's attention was regarding this situation.

350
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:14,400
Some creators who had previously collaborated with Samurai Buyer also made their own statements of solidarity with Mary.

351
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:20,320
There was an additional drama related to statements that Misaki had allegedly made on call regarding one of their first collaborators,

352
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:30,000
the Anime Man, which is a statement that we'll return to later. In response to this, the Anime Man stated that he had ceased working with them due to the fact that he found elements of the operation fairly sketchy,

353
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:37,840
not the most glamorous endorsement. Some even asked whether Mary had grounds to sue for unlawful dismissal, and whether the legal argument was in his favour,

354
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:44,960
which I'm not sure it was, given the fact that he wasn't full time. Nonetheless, he was in a foreign country with little money and limited time,

355
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:51,440
it was not practical, which is probably why they sacked him, because what was he gonna do? Well, uh, this.

356
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:59,360
On top of this, other creators began to post videos onto YouTube, people began to spread the word, and suddenly it seemed like the whole world would know about

357
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:09,200
the injustice of Samurai Buyer. However, as quickly as it was picking up, it was shut down. One evening, Meriwether appeared to tweet out legal threats which had been made by Misaki,

358
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:18,960
and the next day this was followed by Meriwether first tweeting in a frenzied manner at iDubbbz begging for help, followed by a rather unconvincing tweet stating that everything he said was a lie.

359
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:27,440
This was briefly followed by him pulling down all his tweets and statements, and commenting that he didn't want to deal with any lawsuits, and just wanted to leave it behind immediately.

360
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:35,280
At around this point, Samurai Buyer had made the statement that they would be conducting further investigations before releasing another more official statement.

361
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:44,400
This response then followed an alleged discussion yielding from a thread posted on Twitter. This Twitlonger victoriously stated that Mary had now admitted to twisting the statements,

362
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:53,200
as well as an invasion of privacy against the corporation. However, for Meriwether's own sake, for his own privacy, like the magnanimous gentile sir that he was,

363
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:58,000
Misaki decided not to go into details regarding this, because you can trust him.

364
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:06,880
The thing is, when you don't give examples, then people don't have anything to look at, which pretty much implies that you're lying through your teeth.

365
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:15,680
In the Twitlonger, they mostly honed in on the claims that Samurai Buyer was a scam, a point which had now been adopted by some of the company's most staunchest critics,

366
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:24,000
and even some former fans. They reiterate that they do ask for payments, but that is inevitable, as they cannot be certain of their own transportation fees,

367
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:33,680
due to the destination, the weight of the content, and the size of the items varying on a case-by-case basis. However, they pledge to make this detail clearer to avoid any confusion down the line,

368
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:39,680
and apologise for any concern that was raised. On top of this, they state that they are intending to extend their service promotion code,

369
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:45,840
a weeaboo, which will halve any service fee, and epic detail to fulfil all your weeaboo wishes. Hooray.

370
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:52,480
They conclude by requesting people to continue supporting Samurai Buyer, so that they can continue to improve their customer service,

371
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:59,280
which I'm not sure is the best justification, but we'll let that slide for now, as there are more pressing matters at hand.

372
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:06,400
Maybe Misaki was hoping that this response would go viral. Unfortunately, it did not. In fact, given the deletion of all the tweets,

373
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:14,160
it seems people's investment in the situation dropped off very sharply. Maybe this was for the best, as the people who did read it didn't find it the most persuasive,

374
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:21,120
partly because releasing DMs where someone admits they're wrong wouldn't be a violation of their privacy, especially after you've sacked them.

375
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:31,040
Misaki trying to use it to morally grandstands seemed transparent, and people cottoned onto the fact that these DMs may have been more telling about Misaki's behaviour than anyone else's.

376
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:39,760
On top of this, when he said someone's statements were quote twisted, well, it was unbelievably vague, and certainly not a clarification of what was true and what wasn't.

377
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:48,400
Further to this, stating that someone invaded your privacy when all they did was accuse you of doing shady stuff, and showing DMs of someone who is allegedly you being a prick,

378
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:55,600
just sounds like you're admitting to the shady stuff and are mad that someone called you out for it. It's basically attacking someone for being a whistleblower.

379
00:37:55,600 --> 00:38:07,440
Combine this with Misaki's legal threats that users had observed the night before, and to them it seemed that he had threatened a distressed person who was in a foreign country with little experience into a position of silence, not a good look.

380
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:17,840
On top of this, the Twitlonger just didn't really talk about much. Sure, the scamming point was pretty important, but equally, the assertion of treatment and that Misaki wasn't who he presented himself as was pretty relevant too.

381
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:24,240
Now, no comment doesn't mean an admission of guilt, but it was gonna be hard for creators to reinvest their trust in him or his brand.

382
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:32,800
I assume some of these creators discussed it privately before placing disclaimers in their description, clarifying their position on the matter, and mostly not complimentary ones.

383
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:40,280
The gauntlet had been laid down, and although Mero's tweets may have been removed, a lot of people's content and narratives were still prevalent in this discourse,

384
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:43,480
which didn't make the Samurai Buyer team very happy.

385
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:55,600
One of those creators talking about the matter was a young, then small YouTuber by the name of Slazo.

386
00:38:55,600 --> 00:39:06,760
Slazo had previously worked with Samurai Buyer himself, but upon finding out about this situation, had made the decision to terminate their relationship and upload a video calling them out for their shady business practices.

387
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:19,320
Now, because of this new information coming out, I have privatized my video I made with Samurai Buyer, which is annoying because I liked that video, but I just can't stand by and endorse the actions of Misaki.

388
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:29,880
Now, Samurai Buyer is a company that doesn't care about its product, it only cares about the bottom line. They want to find the easiest way to make money, even if it means ripping people off.

389
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:36,360
Well, now we know that money is number one priority, over ethics, over customer service, over everything.

390
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:42,920
And so it's very safe to say that the reason he fired Merry was because Merry had fulfilled his purpose.

391
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:51,000
He had increased their social media's following by many times. A new mascot, a new subscription service, he'd made them a lot.

392
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:56,520
He had laid out a clear plan for them that they could easily follow, and he was no longer required.

393
00:39:56,520 --> 00:40:02,200
His video tended to mirror the claims made by Merryweather in the Twitlonger, making the video rather straightforward.

394
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:12,440
However, as an upload on the situation, it garnered significant traction, obtaining over 400,000 views, thus becoming one of the predominant narratives for those wondering what happened.

395
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:20,600
He also uploaded a follow-up video on the matter, which acquired a further 100,000 views. However, these are not videos that I want to focus on, no.

396
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:31,320
In another video uploaded a few months after his original videos covering the situation, he details a serious legal threat made by the Samurai Buyer team, but one that appeared to be quite empty.

397
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:58,360
The damages inflicted to us also continued to worsen, and we can no longer ignore the issue.

398
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:10,760
Consequently, we formally request that the two videos concerning Samurai Buyer and the scandal occurring after a member of our staff was terminated to be removed within seven days of this mail received.

399
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:20,200
If seven days passes without compliance or negotiation, we will be forced to consider legal action to arrange videos removed and damages.

400
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:23,000
Um, that was two months ago.

401
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:29,400
I responded asking what parts of the video in question they considered false, and they just responded with,

402
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:34,760
everything bad I said about them, just in quotes, and that's it.

403
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:46,600
I responded asking how exactly my claims were wrong and what the evidence was, and they just responded a half month later, just asking me to take the video down.

404
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:57,720
Um, and now let me clarify, if there was actually something I said that was wrong or misconstrued in that video, and they told me, just straight up told me why it was wrong,

405
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:08,920
then I would do everything in my power to make sure people know that that was wrong. I would pin a comment on both of those videos, I would say it in this video, I would make it known.

406
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:17,960
But instead, they hit me with this legal action notice, this, if you don't respond in a week, we will take legal action for damages.

407
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:22,280
No you're not, no you're not, and that is just the worst way to go about this.

408
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:28,120
All it results in is a worse image for your business, something that you don't want, and I don't want to deal with.

409
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:35,080
However, the professional legal team over at Samurai Buyer persisted with the notices, and these videos were eventually removed,

410
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:40,040
as alongside other factors that we'll discuss soon, Slazo felt they had served their purpose.

411
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:47,160
Another creator who uploaded a video on the situation alluded to a similar experience with Samurai Buyer as recently as ten months ago,

412
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:51,960
over two years after this conflict, on a video with seventeen thousand views.

413
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:58,280
Now, a majority of what I've spoken about today has been removed since, some of which could be partly credited to Samurai Buyer's

414
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:04,040
resolute approach towards those who have spoken about it, and the fact that no large creator was particularly outspoken,

415
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:10,280
perhaps due to the fact that many of them had worked with Samurai Buyer themselves and felt rather embarrassed or awkward about it.

416
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:16,680
Samurai Buyer has mostly succeeded in suppressing the situation, and with the source of sentiments conveyed in their emails,

417
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:23,000
you'd think they'd have reason to. You would receive the impression that Samurai Buyer's business was mortally wounded by this coverage,

418
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:31,080
but I can't say I completely agree. In fact, I think the damage was already done the moment that creators and audiences thought they were being deceived.

419
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:34,360
If they were, is another question. Let's talk about that.

420
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:55,560
As I mentioned earlier, Misaki and Samurai Buyer had a close association, and an even closer one assumed by many audiences.

421
00:43:55,560 --> 00:44:01,320
Misaki's place in these sponsorships was as much a selling point as the product or the services themselves.

422
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:07,880
Misaki-Hello, awesome, I send you cool things. May I know your name and phone number it needs for shipments?

423
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:12,360
Then he asked if you could Skype me and I said, it's 3am babe, I'm gonna have a kip if that's okay.

424
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:15,960
In which he apologised profusely cause he's a lovely polite Japanese man.

425
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:20,240
So when it was supposedly revealed that Misaki was not the man who people believed him to be,

426
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:25,960
and was in fact the result of an accident which was exploited by a rather calculated individual who was not actually

427
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:30,760
the representation of innocence, people probably felt rather deceived, especially YouTubers,

428
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:36,280
some of whom were probably a tad embarrassed, bantering with this guy who was just so unassuming about your little

429
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:43,240
English jokes, and you exploiting the shortfalls for a little banter. Instead, the YouTuber was in fact the one being

430
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:49,800
Because a lot of these creators probably wouldn't have made videos if they were approached by a smart, well-spoken businessman.

431
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:55,040
Some people like Jaiden Animations, who appeared to have such affection for Misaki, didn't know what to believe

432
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:59,360
because of the person who she thought she had come to know. So what should we believe?

433
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:05,960
Well, looking retrospectively at some of the conversations, it's hard to feel a slightly contrived nature in certain comments.

434
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:11,880
In a way, this was expected, because the way Misaki marketed himself tended to adapt to the person he was talking to,

435
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:17,280
he'd be more offensive around the edgy commentators, and more wholesome around the more family-friendly creators,

436
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:24,640
but at the same time, this doesn't really alter comments such as I English no good, or the confusing spam with sperm conversation.

437
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:30,520
In hindsight, it seems glaringly obvious, but if you don't consider it, you probably wouldn't have noticed.

438
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:36,440
I think although at the time, iDubbbz probably wasn't overly suspicious, he may well have been entertaining the possibility

439
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:38,840
that he was being hoodwinked for the sake of clowns.

440
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:46,200
Misaki's really been getting at my fucking nerves this past year, you know, always chatting my ear off about dumb shit,

441
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:54,680
wanting me to do things for him, and it's like, dude, I really like it that you're so non-PC, and I really appreciate that.

442
00:45:54,680 --> 00:46:01,680
You know, there's a lot of non-PC Asians out there, okay? You're not unique, Misaki. You don't have a stranglehold over me.

443
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:07,600
It's this comment I found particularly interesting, because you receive the impression that Samurai Bayou was drilling in this persona

444
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:13,640
to the point where even iDubbbz was moderately irritated by it, and if you make iDubbbz pissed off at edgy humour,

445
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:15,560
then you're probably doing something wrong.

446
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:21,760
Ian went on to make this future comment about Samurai Bayou, which although hard to read into because it's Ian,

447
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:29,120
seems to imply that he may have been quite happy that he finally had an excuse to end his relationship with Misaki and Samurai Bayou.

448
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:36,920
It's hard to read into a lot of edgy creators and their opinions on the business, because it's often veiled in thick irony,

449
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:43,240
but just over a month before the drama transpired, another creator, and friend of iDubbbz by the name of Max Mofo,

450
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:49,600
made a video where he didn't seem particularly thrilled by the content sent to him either, nor the circumstances.

451
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:58,360
I think we have a box from Misaki, I didn't actually want him to send me anything, he kind of forced himself on me,

452
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:08,840
and now I feel rude not to open it, I think he's the only person in the industry where you can, you have to open his shit for free.

453
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:16,840
Most YouTubers I feel, to do sponsored videos or anything by a product, usually there's a little bit of, you know, back and forth involved,

454
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:25,320
but iDubbbz pretty much made Misaki famous, and now he thinks he can fucking parade his shit everywhere and everyone will just open it for him.

455
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:31,000
And he sent me jack shit, I don't think he thinks much of me, there's not much to work with here.

456
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:36,520
I think the joke may have been wearing thin, and perhaps people would have found out by their own accord eventually,

457
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:41,480
but it was a tad too premature for people's liking, which led to the rather abrupt response.

458
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:47,640
On top of this, although I note at the start that their social media presence as English wasn't very good throughout most of 2015,

459
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:53,960
I'd also note that it had significantly improved in the run up to the iDubbbz collaboration, with only occasional English mistakes,

460
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:57,480
and certainly not ones that were exhibited in future conversations.

461
00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:02,280
I think there were definitely elements of Misaki's personality that were played out for theatrical effect,

462
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:09,240
but was the extent of the deceit really as far as implied? Was Misaki a fluent English speaker who had spent time in Australia?

463
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:15,160
Well, let's reintroduce the Anime Man. The Anime Man was the guy who worked with Samurai Buyer before iDubbbz,

464
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:23,080
he was also an Australian living in Japan, and his subsequent withdrawal from doing business with Samurai Buyer would certainly make an observant individual take a second glance.

465
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:29,080
But hell, maybe he was just jealous of the fact that other creators didn't have to pay for their promotion as Misaki claims.

466
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:31,240
Wait, Misaki claimed that?

467
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:41,880
Misaki- He's a pretty nice guy, but you know, he's never already fired me these days, I don't know. Maybe some jealousy.

468
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:49,800
In a clip briefly leaked at the height of the drama, an individual who appears to be Misaki seems to be talking about the Anime Man in quite effortless fashion,

469
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:53,080
perhaps with the slightest tinge of an Australian accent.

470
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:54,440
Misaki- Joey, you mean?

471
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:55,640
Joey- Joey, yeah.

472
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:56,600
Misaki- You know him?

473
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:59,320
Joey- No, I don't, I've just seen you've worked with him.

474
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:04,280
Misaki- Yeah, he's actually staying, he was staying in Australia.

475
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:07,080
Joey- Oh yeah, I heard he moved to Japan.

476
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:10,440
Misaki- Yes, he's half Australian and Japanese.

477
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:17,800
Now, in all fairness to Misaki, he doesn't really say anything particularly inflammatory, he seems to be theorising in quite a freeform manner,

478
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:25,160
but equally that freeform manner doesn't really match the forced English mistakes in conversations that were often portrayed in people's uploads.

479
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:30,040
Is this the only possible explanation? No, but it's not something that's ever been dispelled.

480
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:36,760
There was a brief comment from Misaki on Twitter during the situation, claiming that he needed staff to help translate a response to someone,

481
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:41,720
whose I'm not sure, but it was attempting to maintain that character, but people were not convinced.

482
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:48,040
I think that the whole ordeal just ruined the image of Misaki so much that people didn't really know who he even was.

483
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:52,200
Even if he couldn't speak perfect English, his whole demeanour was still pulled into question,

484
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:57,560
his conduct was a far cry from what had been expected of him, because he was seen as this community figure,

485
00:49:57,560 --> 00:50:02,120
and because he was seen as this community figure, he was going to be held to community standards,

486
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:06,360
especially given that his stick was this innocent, wholesome man.

487
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:09,000
Very few YouTubers who had previously worked with Misaki,

488
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:15,720
given him their time, and entertained their quirky conversations, were likely going to be interested in rekindling that relationship,

489
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:18,520
because it undermined the person who they had come to know.

490
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:23,880
It also ended the potential for future relationships on this basis, because it undermined the punchlines.

491
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:30,360
Jokes like these, as unamusing as they were to me, were based on the sincere naivety of Misaki's character.

492
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:35,560
If you have an interaction with knowledge that it's all just an act, it doesn't make the misunderstandings funny,

493
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:41,960
because it doesn't take a comedy genius to change spam to sperm, it's only really funny when the person isn't aware.

494
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:47,960
With this in mind, Samurai Buyer were basically relegated to another company with no real outstanding qualities,

495
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:49,640
but it wasn't even that.

496
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:55,080
Because of the persisting stigma left by the controversy, they can't really bring back the character,

497
00:50:55,080 --> 00:51:00,920
and any other promotional campaign conducted on YouTube to people who were familiar would seem out of character.

498
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:04,040
Their relationships with YouTubers was mostly at an end.

499
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:09,400
I have to admit, however, I don't really feel overly bad for any YouTubers who merely collaborated with Samurai Buyer

500
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:13,160
under the pretense that they were talking with this friendly Japanese man,

501
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:17,000
because it was a pretty naive assumption to make on their behalf in the first place.

502
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:21,880
Such an innocent image is something that would have been hard to maintain naturally for over a year,

503
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:26,440
because surely at some point it's gonna clock that they should improve their linguistic skills,

504
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:31,960
and the experience of talking to other people with English as their first language would have helped them improve anyway.

505
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:36,600
This persona would have been pretty difficult to maintain naturally, given its fame.

506
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:42,360
The perception people always had when they imagined Misaki was almost like this one man show at Samurai Buyer,

507
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:46,040
because it's the only real way that such a business would have been able to work.

508
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:52,920
Misaki's whole existence became inherently counterintuitive, and people entertained it because it was fun.

509
00:51:53,080 --> 00:52:00,040
I think creators just saw it through a very narrow, optimistic lens, based on stereotypes they had formulated in their head,

510
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:05,480
and they probably jumped to the comedic potential rather than considering the likelihood of this persona.

511
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:09,960
Do I blame them for that? No. I can see myself easily doing the same thing,

512
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:14,760
but I don't think it's some huge deception on that front, it's just a bit of a letdown,

513
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:21,960
but that letdown ultimately harmed Samurai Buyer more than any YouTuber, so is it not them we should feel sorry for?

514
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:23,240
Well, not really.

515
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:37,880
In the Spongebob Squarepants movie, there's a scene where our protagonists try to purchase ice cream from a sweet old vendor lady,

516
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:41,320
yet something isn't quite right. This scene may not intend to be,

517
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:47,320
but it's a good representation of how one's focus on the ideal can sometimes distract us from the reality.

518
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:54,040
Credit where credit's due, Samurai Buyer employed a bold marketing strategy which paid its dues for a substantial amount of time,

519
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:58,360
but ultimately, when said marketing strategy is based on a level of deception,

520
00:52:58,360 --> 00:53:05,320
you always risk a loss of trust when it is revealed, even if it is something that perhaps people should've worked out anyway.

521
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:10,840
In a way, if Samurai Buyer had revealed it themselves, we may have all been able to have a laugh about it to move on,

522
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:16,360
but the circumstances under which this information was released couldn't be more ironic if it tried to be.

523
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:23,080
Masaki, and perhaps some of the members at Samurai Buyer, maintained a character that was given support and attention

524
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:28,840
due to his perceived innocence and blind kindness. It relied on people's sympathy and acceptance,

525
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:33,160
even if it was from a somewhat condescending position on the YouTuber's behalf.

526
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:39,880
With that in mind, when they encountered someone in a similar position, they should've at least understood the fundamental conditions

527
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:44,040
that drive us to do the right things in those situations with those people,

528
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:47,880
because they were taking advantage of those exact sentiments from YouTubers,

529
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:53,640
and yet when their new employee, who was in a country that he didn't know, with a language that he didn't speak,

530
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:59,560
perhaps slightly naively, when they should've shown a bit of sympathy, they neglected that mantra.

531
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:04,760
It's hard to know exactly what occurred, but to me, it seems that after leading someone on,

532
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:10,440
they sacked him for reasons they've continuously changed, and then proceeded to taunt him while he was in distress.

533
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:16,280
Just the thought of that couldn't be more antithetical to the persona that Masaki had constructed.

534
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:21,000
This doesn't mean that the narratives were perfect, I think the Twitlong was flawed, it was overdramatic,

535
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:25,720
and it appears that Merry was heading out to Japan regardless, though I assume the extension wasn't planned.

536
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:29,800
Nonetheless, it seems somewhat misframed in the Twitlong, and he was criticised for it.

537
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:35,000
However, he also ended up being subject to some pretty rotten narratives which were completely unsubstantiated,

538
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:39,400
including claims that he had acted out in the office, which were retracted when the guy making them

539
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:43,240
admitted he had barely worked at the company. There's a good Reddit interaction that occurred

540
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:48,280
where you can see these two arguments. Unfortunately, even if you saw the flaws in the claimant's statement,

541
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:53,080
it didn't alter the experiences they appeared to be rooted in, and the fact that Samurai Buyer had altered

542
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:57,640
their explanation multiple times made it look like they were struggling to justify an ill-founded

543
00:54:57,640 --> 00:55:03,320
dismissal, and subsequent vicious, malicious derision. Once the news broke, and they finally

544
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:08,040
realised this was impacting their reputation, they changed their tune, but not by bringing back the

545
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:13,560
old friendly face of Misaki, no, that was already in the past. They went into full corporate mode,

546
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:17,960
threatening legal action against Merryweather, and anyone who spoke ill of them. They persisted

547
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:22,760
this campaign against creators who uploaded videos on the matter, even uploads which didn't receive

548
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:27,400
the most traffic, the ones that were basically barebones reaction videos. I honestly think that

549
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:32,120
most of these threats didn't carry much weight, but it also seems a fair few creators were aware

550
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:35,800
that their narratives were slightly misguided, particularly the one regarding the fraudulent

551
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:40,920
nature of their site. As I said right at the start, how they format payments is a tad novel,

552
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:45,160
and I can see how it could have been misleading, however, I do not think their site is structured

553
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:50,280
to intentionally scam people, although certain stories such as the leftover returns being placed

554
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:55,400
in loot boxes may well be true. When you're accusing a company of scamming, I can see how that would

555
00:55:55,400 --> 00:56:00,360
place you on shaky ground if you didn't have the evidence to back up those claims, so I also think

556
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:04,920
that self-doubt on the behalf of creators probably played into the outcome of this being mostly

557
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:09,560
removed from the internet, and to be fair, that's a reasonable justification. It does seem that some

558
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:14,040
narratives with less substantiation were caught amongst the stronger ones. Nonetheless, given

559
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:18,920
their legal team were about as competent as the Mr. Misaki sales persona, it just looked like a

560
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:23,880
desperate attempt to eradicate the existence of the instant, so I'll take a moment to set the record

561
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:28,760
straight. I don't think Samurai Buyer is a scam website, I don't think they're gonna run off with

562
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:33,400
your money into the sunset and you will not receive your product. If you wanna order from them,

563
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:38,040
go for it. This obviously does not invalidate any legitimate complaints that people have,

564
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:42,680
and there were issues with how they presented certain information. However, I think this problem

565
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:47,560
has been mostly resolved, and they currently offer ways to approximate shipping fees on the basis of

566
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:52,920
predictive package specifications. On top of this, much of their behaviour could be chalked up to

567
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:58,280
basic corporation standards. I'm sure that it's not unheard of for a company to lay off a foreign

568
00:56:58,280 --> 00:57:03,080
employee who they feel like they've used up, and can probably get away with dismissing, and I'm sure

569
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:08,120
YouTubers have collaborated with corporations who've done far worse things than Samurai Buyer,

570
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:12,040
I want to make that clear. However, they can get away with it because they don't attach a

571
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:17,240
personality to their brand, nor do they ingratiate themselves into the community as this benevolent

572
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:22,280
friend to all. When Samurai Buyer did that with Misaki, they lost the privilege of distance,

573
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:26,440
especially for Misaki himself, whose childish antics in the situation were that which not even

574
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:31,720
a corporation would typically stoop to due to the sheer insensitivity and terrible optics. This was

575
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:36,360
what jeopardised relationships, especially that with iDubbbz, one of their biggest cheerleaders,

576
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:40,840
who Samurai Buyer literally used to promote this job opening. I wouldn't be surprised if Ian

577
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:45,400
genuinely felt bad for promoting it in the first place, and hell, there was certainly no way that

578
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:50,040
he was ever working with them again. It was awkward for anyone who had promoted the narrative about

579
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:54,840
this sweet, naive Japanese man after the situation, now that someone from the community was actually

580
00:57:54,840 --> 00:58:00,120
screwed over, but as said I didn't blame them, it was easy to miss. The stupid thing is, if Samurai

581
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:04,600
Buyer hadn't intimidated Meriwether and others, they probably could have found a middle ground

582
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:09,640
resolution which the public recognised, and both sides endorsed, where some of the inaccuracies

583
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:14,040
were rolled back on. Instead, by threatening legal action and causing an immediate removal

584
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:18,600
from someone who seemed frenzied and panicked to online onlookers, no one actually believed

585
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:23,080
their attraction was sincere, and it just made them look like corporate bullies. People aren't

586
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:28,200
idiots, and they are sensitive to these circumstances. Samurai Buyer wasn't, and that was

587
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:33,800
what undermined any humanity people thought they had. Since the situation, Samurai Buyer have

588
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:37,880
maintained their narrative, and although I can understand their annoyance at certain claims,

589
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:42,200
I still feel like they're missing perspective. Many of their tweets from their old account have

590
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:46,600
fallen into the suspension of bits, however they still receive questions about the situation on

591
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:51,160
their new one from time to time, and they have continued to attack Merry, including calling him

592
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:56,680
bitter, butthurt, and even racist, which is pretty ludicrous given the standard set by Misaki.

593
00:58:57,320 --> 00:59:06,360
Misaki recently tried to contact me a lot saying how he wants to do a couple of voice calls with

594
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:10,600
me, unfortunately I never responded, and I'm actually too much of a pussy to talk in voice

595
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:14,520
chat with Misaki. This isn't to say that I necessarily think this is the most egregious

596
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:18,680
content, though the black face is pretty unpalatable, but they set the standard for

597
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:23,400
edgy humour in your marketing, and unless someone was actively tweeting out hate content, for which

598
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:27,160
they probably would have been immensely reprimanded for, then I don't believe that such

599
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:31,800
a claim is remotely fair. You'd think that after seeming so upset about being called scammers,

600
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:37,640
they'd understand not to throw out such flagrant terminology, but oh well, an eye for an eye I

601
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:41,640
guess. Misaki has since supposedly left the company and moved on to greener pastures,

602
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:46,040
so any comments are unlikely to be coming from Misaki himself now, but if they're gonna maintain

603
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:49,880
that point of view, I don't think they should do that without a bit of challenge. However,

604
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:54,520
that's far from the main intent behind this video, which is more a cautionary one.

605
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:59,320
The Misaki character had limited gimmicks, and yet he basically found a cheat code to bypass

606
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:03,560
a lot of complex judgements we would typically make when considering collaborations, even if it

607
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:08,200
was accidental. It allowed him to basically be a social comedian, moving between YouTuber

608
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:12,600
conversations and adapting to their style, sometimes to uncomfortable degrees. If anyone

609
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:16,840
else had done this, it would have seemed quite disingenuous, and yet people gave it a pass because

610
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:21,400
we assumed it was some sweet foreign man trying to fit in with our little YouTube project.

611
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:25,800
Samurai Buyer then often sent over items that catered to the individual creator, whether that

612
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:30,520
was Pokemon plushies for Jayden, or stuffed female legs for Filthy Frank. It made them think that

613
01:00:30,520 --> 01:00:36,680
Mr Misaki, in all of his naivety, still cared about their interests, how sweet, but they were

614
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:41,240
just part of the plan. Eventually that more cutthroat corporate side showed, and everyone

615
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:45,960
was shocked, but like the Spongebob Squarepants scene, sometimes you gotta look out for the bigger

616
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:50,520
fish. The message I'll conclude on is that it's worth being careful about the assumptions you

617
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:55,720
make based on a person's lack of technical skills, it doesn't necessarily reflect their character,

618
01:00:55,720 --> 01:01:00,760
especially if the person's an adult with decent social ability elsewhere. Your sympathy can easily

619
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:05,800
be exploited, and eventually you, or someone else, finds out the hard way. The moment you think

620
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:11,000
someone can do no wrong, is the moment you probably underestimate them. That's not to be paranoid,

621
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:16,440
just cautious. Samurai Buyer was the business that got to have a human face for a bit,

622
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:21,080
and as a fun little novelty, I suppose it can tell us a little, and makes for at least an

623
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:25,960
interesting tale, but as a trend in a world where we already have more than enough brands trying

624
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:30,920
to infiltrate the human mind, I think I like this Pinocchio better off hollow.

625
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:40,520
So yes, that was the video, I hope you enjoyed, I am an absolute mess right now,

626
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:45,320
and I'm probably gonna go take a shower, have a rest, because that was a bit more taxing than

627
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:50,920
I expected it to be. Quite a dense video, with a lot of words in sentences. I wanna give a big

628
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:54,840
thanks to my editors, once again I'm sure they have done a fantastic job, please go and check

629
01:01:54,840 --> 01:02:00,440
them out, I will leave them in the pinned comments. I also wanna give a big shoutout to my Patreons,

630
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:04,680
once again $10 Patreons being shown on screen right now, and also wanna give a big thanks to

631
01:02:04,680 --> 01:02:12,280
my $50 Patreons, Hypercube, Samhala Baloo, Amanda, and Caroline, as well as my $100 Patreons,

632
01:02:12,280 --> 01:02:17,800
Yesenia Ramirez, Brandon Jonk, and Christopher Carrasse. Thank you again for your support,

633
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:23,240
it means the world, and it keeps my head up in these times, in these crazy times, so much

634
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:27,880
appreciated. I don't have too much else to add, if you wanna fire me, my social medias will be in

635
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:33,240
the pinned comment too, though I have been on a bit of a break from them, but if you wanna try,

636
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:37,880
there they are, and, I don't know what else to say, just, thanks again,

637
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:41,800
for all your support guys, take care, I'll see you in the next one.
