1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Mediator or menace?

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:11,960
Hello ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the right opinion the home of a twat with too much free time and dr. Phil

3
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:16,480
He's been making the YouTube rounds recently. Don't worry. I'm not going to go triggered Trone here

4
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:21,440
This will be the right opinion that you all know and love slash hate which quick PSA by the way

5
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,640
I'm the superior Tro no question

6
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:24,440
But anyhow

7
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:30,760
We're going to take a dive into the culture itself that yields the man who has been the subject of so many videos of interest

8
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:33,600
In the months of recent dr. Phil, dr

9
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:40,360
Phil is the American talk show created by none other than the great Oprah Winfrey and hosted by Phil McGraw it began airing in

10
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:42,440
2002 with the concept of dr

11
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:49,520
Phil talking about various topics and often drawing on individual experiences with the use of everyday people as their guest to illustrate that is still

12
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,440
Going strong to this day and with the recent trend of content made on it

13
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,480
I'm sure it's not going to die anytime soon. So he might as well get used to it now

14
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,360
I can't speak too much in depth about the old shows but looking into the current repertoire

15
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,720
What generally happens is that most of the time dr

16
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,520
Phil tends to have some very irrational

17
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:11,460
Individuals appearing out of very exceptional extreme cases and tries to make sense of their behavior. It is important to note the dr

18
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:15,000
Phil in spite of the criticism that he receives is a qualified clinical

19
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:21,800
Psychologist to my understanding and generally speaking does behave with enough decorum that you would expect someone of that stature to behave with with that

20
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:25,920
said the issues that have been presented on the show are quite black and white and although dr

21
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,300
Phil may attempt to make sense of them

22
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:31,820
He is a lot more upfront than many psychologists in the field typically would be generally though

23
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:38,340
Although there are certain preferred methods of counseling. There is no unanimous consensus as long as he acts within the ethical guidelines

24
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:45,200
He definitely has a few gotchas which probably don't endear the subject and he also has inclusions that enhance its entertainment value over

25
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,660
Welfare of the individual but at the end of the day given the fact that the individual may be behaving somewhat

26
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:54,980
Immorally those sorts of one-liners and comments can serve as a counterbalance in that scenario on top of that

27
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:56,660
It's probably what also kept it on air

28
00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:01,260
I feel that many people don't watch beyond the base value that it can provide you don't really watch dr

29
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:08,020
Phil for its educational value with that said it does have a softer edge to it than I mean in England where our equivalent is

30
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:14,100
The Jeremy Kyle show which involves Jeremy Kyle calling people disgraceful and acting disgusted or some sexually frustrated

31
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:16,580
Fella with no front teeth is sat on the couch

32
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:22,940
It's not a show that enhances people's lives to say the least so comparatively dr. Phil probably does a better job there

33
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:25,280
However, there is one clear distinction that dr

34
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:30,600
Phil and perhaps some other American variations do have which has been simmering cause for philosophical debate

35
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,960
Which I thought would be cool to discuss in today's video

36
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:37,460
We often ask ourselves at what age does a child become responsible for their own actions?

37
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:40,680
I think we all know what direction we're careening in here. Yes

38
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,720
We're going to talk about her Danielle Bregoli and I have bided my time

39
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:50,060
But she's just too much of a fascinating case study to be ignored not necessarily as the whole topic of this video

40
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,840
But as someone who is not just a symptom of the worst of culture

41
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,880
But of how that coach can somehow respond to promote that behavior on the basis of its exceptionalism alone

42
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:03,800
one of the things that many people seem to get when discussing Danielle Bregoli is that in spite of the fact that many

43
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:08,880
Youtubers would approach her topic as talking about an adult because she does behave like one

44
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:15,420
We seem to forget that she is still young not legal to do things that many people would be and she certainly wasn't legal when

45
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:19,560
She appeared on the Dr. Phil show either at the ripe old age of 13 now

46
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:25,240
I'm where there is a certain flexibility within maturity and although mature isn't the word I describe her as I

47
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,940
Understand that some people can adopt certain traits of those outside their age range while retaining others

48
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:35,000
But there still has to be a line and principle that we operate on and yet here we are one and a half years on

49
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
with her as an international

50
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,920
Superstar acting transparently out of her depth. It shouldn't have happened. Why did it happen?

51
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,080
Well, it all began with the Dr. Phil episode for anyone who wasn't aware

52
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:48,640
Which I assume most of you are due to some negative audience interaction

53
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:54,040
Her responses appeared to escalate and she told the audience to quote catch me outside. How about that?

54
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:59,400
However, her annunciation led it to sounding like cash me outside

55
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:05,520
How about that which is what precipitated the eventual attention what a lot of people forget that in that interview?

56
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:11,840
There was actually a lot of meaningful content espoused by dr. Phil and in a way that was undermined by the noun viral acts in

57
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:19,560
A way, I think this event outlined the morally ambiguous area of dr. Phil's show the child viewer interaction from a personal perspective

58
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:25,960
I do not think a child going on live television is the best form of therapy as proven by Danielle Bregoli and yes

59
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:31,440
She may be rich but lifestyle is beyond money and my thoughts are that this will not be healthy in the long term and it

60
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:36,280
Has been a very volatile ride so far even with the moolah certainly the mother hasn't helped

61
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:42,120
But once again, the platform was given and she used it on the surface level a televised interview doesn't do anything

62
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:47,400
Therapeutically special for a child that a covert interview can't do. So why do people do it?

63
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:54,320
The initial answer would be for attention which leads to the conclusion that exploiting a child like that for attention is not very moral at

64
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:59,360
All making the ethics of the practice very questionable. However, this is where the ambiguity enters

65
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,840
You see it's hard to tell how much dr.

66
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:08,080
Phil exists beyond the show and from what I've heard and what I've read they do involve themselves with enhancement programs of children who

67
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,740
feature in something known as turnabout ranch now

68
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:16,880
I cannot assume with absolution given how vague and convoluted all the information is online how much support is provided

69
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:23,400
It does seem they play some role in supporting children and improving their behavior at that place from the statistics analyze

70
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:29,080
There appears to be somewhat success from it. Although it only measures ratings within the first year afterwards

71
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,480
So it's hard to imply anything long-term from it

72
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:38,400
It's also really difficult to work out how much support is provided because we only see the footage that's provided and once again

73
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:44,820
It could all just be for views. There's also the indirect knock-ons like the dr. Phil foundation, which does good work from what I understand

74
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:51,400
Once again, that's not directly attributable to having children on the show and we have to remember what this discussion is about children

75
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:57,040
So we're actively choosing to take their child on public television a decision that they may not be responsible enough to make

76
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,140
I know it sounds slightly Machiavellian

77
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:05,280
But I'm not too bothered if an able adult appears on the show and doesn't leave any better off than they're right mainly because they

78
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:10,400
Have to acknowledge the possible consequences from appearing on the show when you have individuals like sexy vegan

79
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:15,040
They do seem slightly irredeemable some things cannot be cured but children are different for me

80
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:18,180
They do not have the ability to reason whether they want to go on the show

81
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:21,360
They may not be able to acknowledge the consequences at a certain age

82
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,320
And if there is a clear disparity with how children are coming out of the program

83
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:30,160
And it appears not to be effective in the long term then it may be right to address it and listen

84
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,220
I haven't watched dr. Phil

85
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:37,940
So I don't know if there's anything stated specifically statistical about that but printed information seems to be a rarity over the effectiveness

86
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:43,760
Going on public TV under such psychological circumstances can be stressful. It can be positive

87
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,760
It can be negative and it's clear there needs to be more evidence

88
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:49,480
But I don't think that should stop dialogue or at least prevent

89
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:57,000
Situations like Danielle Bregoli from spiraling out of control because whatever part of her was salvageable has been thoroughly tested

90
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:02,720
Thanks to the evolving media and I don't think that a child should be put on blast for entertainment value alone

91
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:08,340
What do you think are there any avid dr. Phil viewers out there? Do we have any interesting statistics?

92
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:13,800
I'd be very inclined to hear because I've googled it and it's just not there apart from you know

93
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,920
The normal journalistic article saying dr

94
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:21,400
Phil is evil and has a human zoo and that's all very biased and I don't want to just base it on that

95
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:26,040
But I'd love to hear I'm kind of torn. Maybe you can persuade me anyhow until the next one

96
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,100
I'm the right opinion and I'll see you then
