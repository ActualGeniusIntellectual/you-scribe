0	2000	Mediator or menace?
6840	11960	Hello ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the right opinion the home of a twat with too much free time and dr. Phil
11960	16480	He's been making the YouTube rounds recently. Don't worry. I'm not going to go triggered Trone here
16480	21440	This will be the right opinion that you all know and love slash hate which quick PSA by the way
21440	23640	I'm the superior Tro no question
23640	24440	But anyhow
24440	30760	We're going to take a dive into the culture itself that yields the man who has been the subject of so many videos of interest
30760	33600	In the months of recent dr. Phil, dr
33600	40360	Phil is the American talk show created by none other than the great Oprah Winfrey and hosted by Phil McGraw it began airing in
40700	42440	2002 with the concept of dr
42440	49520	Phil talking about various topics and often drawing on individual experiences with the use of everyday people as their guest to illustrate that is still
49520	52440	Going strong to this day and with the recent trend of content made on it
52440	56480	I'm sure it's not going to die anytime soon. So he might as well get used to it now
56480	60360	I can't speak too much in depth about the old shows but looking into the current repertoire
60360	62720	What generally happens is that most of the time dr
62720	64520	Phil tends to have some very irrational
64520	71460	Individuals appearing out of very exceptional extreme cases and tries to make sense of their behavior. It is important to note the dr
71460	75000	Phil in spite of the criticism that he receives is a qualified clinical
75280	81800	Psychologist to my understanding and generally speaking does behave with enough decorum that you would expect someone of that stature to behave with with that
81800	85920	said the issues that have been presented on the show are quite black and white and although dr
85920	87300	Phil may attempt to make sense of them
87300	91820	He is a lot more upfront than many psychologists in the field typically would be generally though
91820	98340	Although there are certain preferred methods of counseling. There is no unanimous consensus as long as he acts within the ethical guidelines
98340	105200	He definitely has a few gotchas which probably don't endear the subject and he also has inclusions that enhance its entertainment value over
105200	109660	Welfare of the individual but at the end of the day given the fact that the individual may be behaving somewhat
109780	114980	Immorally those sorts of one-liners and comments can serve as a counterbalance in that scenario on top of that
114980	116660	It's probably what also kept it on air
116660	121260	I feel that many people don't watch beyond the base value that it can provide you don't really watch dr
121260	128020	Phil for its educational value with that said it does have a softer edge to it than I mean in England where our equivalent is
128020	134100	The Jeremy Kyle show which involves Jeremy Kyle calling people disgraceful and acting disgusted or some sexually frustrated
134380	136580	Fella with no front teeth is sat on the couch
136580	142940	It's not a show that enhances people's lives to say the least so comparatively dr. Phil probably does a better job there
142940	145280	However, there is one clear distinction that dr
145280	150600	Phil and perhaps some other American variations do have which has been simmering cause for philosophical debate
150600	152960	Which I thought would be cool to discuss in today's video
152960	157460	We often ask ourselves at what age does a child become responsible for their own actions?
157460	160680	I think we all know what direction we're careening in here. Yes
160680	163720	We're going to talk about her Danielle Bregoli and I have bided my time
163800	170060	But she's just too much of a fascinating case study to be ignored not necessarily as the whole topic of this video
170080	173840	But as someone who is not just a symptom of the worst of culture
173840	178880	But of how that coach can somehow respond to promote that behavior on the basis of its exceptionalism alone
178880	183800	one of the things that many people seem to get when discussing Danielle Bregoli is that in spite of the fact that many
183960	188880	Youtubers would approach her topic as talking about an adult because she does behave like one
188880	195420	We seem to forget that she is still young not legal to do things that many people would be and she certainly wasn't legal when
195420	199560	She appeared on the Dr. Phil show either at the ripe old age of 13 now
199560	205240	I'm where there is a certain flexibility within maturity and although mature isn't the word I describe her as I
205280	209940	Understand that some people can adopt certain traits of those outside their age range while retaining others
209940	215000	But there still has to be a line and principle that we operate on and yet here we are one and a half years on
215000	217000	with her as an international
217360	221920	Superstar acting transparently out of her depth. It shouldn't have happened. Why did it happen?
221920	225080	Well, it all began with the Dr. Phil episode for anyone who wasn't aware
225080	228640	Which I assume most of you are due to some negative audience interaction
228640	234040	Her responses appeared to escalate and she told the audience to quote catch me outside. How about that?
235800	239400	However, her annunciation led it to sounding like cash me outside
239400	245520	How about that which is what precipitated the eventual attention what a lot of people forget that in that interview?
245520	251840	There was actually a lot of meaningful content espoused by dr. Phil and in a way that was undermined by the noun viral acts in
251840	259560	A way, I think this event outlined the morally ambiguous area of dr. Phil's show the child viewer interaction from a personal perspective
259560	265960	I do not think a child going on live television is the best form of therapy as proven by Danielle Bregoli and yes
265960	271440	She may be rich but lifestyle is beyond money and my thoughts are that this will not be healthy in the long term and it
271440	276280	Has been a very volatile ride so far even with the moolah certainly the mother hasn't helped
276280	282120	But once again, the platform was given and she used it on the surface level a televised interview doesn't do anything
282640	287400	Therapeutically special for a child that a covert interview can't do. So why do people do it?
287400	294320	The initial answer would be for attention which leads to the conclusion that exploiting a child like that for attention is not very moral at
294320	299360	All making the ethics of the practice very questionable. However, this is where the ambiguity enters
299360	301840	You see it's hard to tell how much dr.
301840	308080	Phil exists beyond the show and from what I've heard and what I've read they do involve themselves with enhancement programs of children who
308080	310740	feature in something known as turnabout ranch now
310740	316880	I cannot assume with absolution given how vague and convoluted all the information is online how much support is provided
316880	323400	It does seem they play some role in supporting children and improving their behavior at that place from the statistics analyze
323400	329080	There appears to be somewhat success from it. Although it only measures ratings within the first year afterwards
329080	331480	So it's hard to imply anything long-term from it
331480	338400	It's also really difficult to work out how much support is provided because we only see the footage that's provided and once again
338400	344820	It could all just be for views. There's also the indirect knock-ons like the dr. Phil foundation, which does good work from what I understand
344820	351400	Once again, that's not directly attributable to having children on the show and we have to remember what this discussion is about children
351400	357040	So we're actively choosing to take their child on public television a decision that they may not be responsible enough to make
357040	359140	I know it sounds slightly Machiavellian
359140	365280	But I'm not too bothered if an able adult appears on the show and doesn't leave any better off than they're right mainly because they
365280	370400	Have to acknowledge the possible consequences from appearing on the show when you have individuals like sexy vegan
370400	375040	They do seem slightly irredeemable some things cannot be cured but children are different for me
375040	378180	They do not have the ability to reason whether they want to go on the show
378180	381360	They may not be able to acknowledge the consequences at a certain age
381360	385320	And if there is a clear disparity with how children are coming out of the program
385320	390160	And it appears not to be effective in the long term then it may be right to address it and listen
390160	391220	I haven't watched dr. Phil
391220	397940	So I don't know if there's anything stated specifically statistical about that but printed information seems to be a rarity over the effectiveness
398040	403760	Going on public TV under such psychological circumstances can be stressful. It can be positive
403760	406760	It can be negative and it's clear there needs to be more evidence
406760	409480	But I don't think that should stop dialogue or at least prevent
409840	417000	Situations like Danielle Bregoli from spiraling out of control because whatever part of her was salvageable has been thoroughly tested
417160	422720	Thanks to the evolving media and I don't think that a child should be put on blast for entertainment value alone
422720	428340	What do you think are there any avid dr. Phil viewers out there? Do we have any interesting statistics?
428340	433800	I'd be very inclined to hear because I've googled it and it's just not there apart from you know
433800	435920	The normal journalistic article saying dr
435920	441400	Phil is evil and has a human zoo and that's all very biased and I don't want to just base it on that
441400	446040	But I'd love to hear I'm kind of torn. Maybe you can persuade me anyhow until the next one
446040	448100	I'm the right opinion and I'll see you then
