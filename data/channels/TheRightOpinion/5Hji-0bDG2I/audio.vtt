00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
Mediator or menace?

00:06.840 --> 00:11.960
Hello ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the right opinion the home of a twat with too much free time and dr. Phil

00:11.960 --> 00:16.480
He's been making the YouTube rounds recently. Don't worry. I'm not going to go triggered Trone here

00:16.480 --> 00:21.440
This will be the right opinion that you all know and love slash hate which quick PSA by the way

00:21.440 --> 00:23.640
I'm the superior Tro no question

00:23.640 --> 00:24.440
But anyhow

00:24.440 --> 00:30.760
We're going to take a dive into the culture itself that yields the man who has been the subject of so many videos of interest

00:30.760 --> 00:33.600
In the months of recent dr. Phil, dr

00:33.600 --> 00:40.360
Phil is the American talk show created by none other than the great Oprah Winfrey and hosted by Phil McGraw it began airing in

00:40.700 --> 00:42.440
2002 with the concept of dr

00:42.440 --> 00:49.520
Phil talking about various topics and often drawing on individual experiences with the use of everyday people as their guest to illustrate that is still

00:49.520 --> 00:52.440
Going strong to this day and with the recent trend of content made on it

00:52.440 --> 00:56.480
I'm sure it's not going to die anytime soon. So he might as well get used to it now

00:56.480 --> 01:00.360
I can't speak too much in depth about the old shows but looking into the current repertoire

01:00.360 --> 01:02.720
What generally happens is that most of the time dr

01:02.720 --> 01:04.520
Phil tends to have some very irrational

01:04.520 --> 01:11.460
Individuals appearing out of very exceptional extreme cases and tries to make sense of their behavior. It is important to note the dr

01:11.460 --> 01:15.000
Phil in spite of the criticism that he receives is a qualified clinical

01:15.280 --> 01:21.800
Psychologist to my understanding and generally speaking does behave with enough decorum that you would expect someone of that stature to behave with with that

01:21.800 --> 01:25.920
said the issues that have been presented on the show are quite black and white and although dr

01:25.920 --> 01:27.300
Phil may attempt to make sense of them

01:27.300 --> 01:31.820
He is a lot more upfront than many psychologists in the field typically would be generally though

01:31.820 --> 01:38.340
Although there are certain preferred methods of counseling. There is no unanimous consensus as long as he acts within the ethical guidelines

01:38.340 --> 01:45.200
He definitely has a few gotchas which probably don't endear the subject and he also has inclusions that enhance its entertainment value over

01:45.200 --> 01:49.660
Welfare of the individual but at the end of the day given the fact that the individual may be behaving somewhat

01:49.780 --> 01:54.980
Immorally those sorts of one-liners and comments can serve as a counterbalance in that scenario on top of that

01:54.980 --> 01:56.660
It's probably what also kept it on air

01:56.660 --> 02:01.260
I feel that many people don't watch beyond the base value that it can provide you don't really watch dr

02:01.260 --> 02:08.020
Phil for its educational value with that said it does have a softer edge to it than I mean in England where our equivalent is

02:08.020 --> 02:14.100
The Jeremy Kyle show which involves Jeremy Kyle calling people disgraceful and acting disgusted or some sexually frustrated

02:14.380 --> 02:16.580
Fella with no front teeth is sat on the couch

02:16.580 --> 02:22.940
It's not a show that enhances people's lives to say the least so comparatively dr. Phil probably does a better job there

02:22.940 --> 02:25.280
However, there is one clear distinction that dr

02:25.280 --> 02:30.600
Phil and perhaps some other American variations do have which has been simmering cause for philosophical debate

02:30.600 --> 02:32.960
Which I thought would be cool to discuss in today's video

02:32.960 --> 02:37.460
We often ask ourselves at what age does a child become responsible for their own actions?

02:37.460 --> 02:40.680
I think we all know what direction we're careening in here. Yes

02:40.680 --> 02:43.720
We're going to talk about her Danielle Bregoli and I have bided my time

02:43.800 --> 02:50.060
But she's just too much of a fascinating case study to be ignored not necessarily as the whole topic of this video

02:50.080 --> 02:53.840
But as someone who is not just a symptom of the worst of culture

02:53.840 --> 02:58.880
But of how that coach can somehow respond to promote that behavior on the basis of its exceptionalism alone

02:58.880 --> 03:03.800
one of the things that many people seem to get when discussing Danielle Bregoli is that in spite of the fact that many

03:03.960 --> 03:08.880
Youtubers would approach her topic as talking about an adult because she does behave like one

03:08.880 --> 03:15.420
We seem to forget that she is still young not legal to do things that many people would be and she certainly wasn't legal when

03:15.420 --> 03:19.560
She appeared on the Dr. Phil show either at the ripe old age of 13 now

03:19.560 --> 03:25.240
I'm where there is a certain flexibility within maturity and although mature isn't the word I describe her as I

03:25.280 --> 03:29.940
Understand that some people can adopt certain traits of those outside their age range while retaining others

03:29.940 --> 03:35.000
But there still has to be a line and principle that we operate on and yet here we are one and a half years on

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
with her as an international

03:37.360 --> 03:41.920
Superstar acting transparently out of her depth. It shouldn't have happened. Why did it happen?

03:41.920 --> 03:45.080
Well, it all began with the Dr. Phil episode for anyone who wasn't aware

03:45.080 --> 03:48.640
Which I assume most of you are due to some negative audience interaction

03:48.640 --> 03:54.040
Her responses appeared to escalate and she told the audience to quote catch me outside. How about that?

03:55.800 --> 03:59.400
However, her annunciation led it to sounding like cash me outside

03:59.400 --> 04:05.520
How about that which is what precipitated the eventual attention what a lot of people forget that in that interview?

04:05.520 --> 04:11.840
There was actually a lot of meaningful content espoused by dr. Phil and in a way that was undermined by the noun viral acts in

04:11.840 --> 04:19.560
A way, I think this event outlined the morally ambiguous area of dr. Phil's show the child viewer interaction from a personal perspective

04:19.560 --> 04:25.960
I do not think a child going on live television is the best form of therapy as proven by Danielle Bregoli and yes

04:25.960 --> 04:31.440
She may be rich but lifestyle is beyond money and my thoughts are that this will not be healthy in the long term and it

04:31.440 --> 04:36.280
Has been a very volatile ride so far even with the moolah certainly the mother hasn't helped

04:36.280 --> 04:42.120
But once again, the platform was given and she used it on the surface level a televised interview doesn't do anything

04:42.640 --> 04:47.400
Therapeutically special for a child that a covert interview can't do. So why do people do it?

04:47.400 --> 04:54.320
The initial answer would be for attention which leads to the conclusion that exploiting a child like that for attention is not very moral at

04:54.320 --> 04:59.360
All making the ethics of the practice very questionable. However, this is where the ambiguity enters

04:59.360 --> 05:01.840
You see it's hard to tell how much dr.

05:01.840 --> 05:08.080
Phil exists beyond the show and from what I've heard and what I've read they do involve themselves with enhancement programs of children who

05:08.080 --> 05:10.740
feature in something known as turnabout ranch now

05:10.740 --> 05:16.880
I cannot assume with absolution given how vague and convoluted all the information is online how much support is provided

05:16.880 --> 05:23.400
It does seem they play some role in supporting children and improving their behavior at that place from the statistics analyze

05:23.400 --> 05:29.080
There appears to be somewhat success from it. Although it only measures ratings within the first year afterwards

05:29.080 --> 05:31.480
So it's hard to imply anything long-term from it

05:31.480 --> 05:38.400
It's also really difficult to work out how much support is provided because we only see the footage that's provided and once again

05:38.400 --> 05:44.820
It could all just be for views. There's also the indirect knock-ons like the dr. Phil foundation, which does good work from what I understand

05:44.820 --> 05:51.400
Once again, that's not directly attributable to having children on the show and we have to remember what this discussion is about children

05:51.400 --> 05:57.040
So we're actively choosing to take their child on public television a decision that they may not be responsible enough to make

05:57.040 --> 05:59.140
I know it sounds slightly Machiavellian

05:59.140 --> 06:05.280
But I'm not too bothered if an able adult appears on the show and doesn't leave any better off than they're right mainly because they

06:05.280 --> 06:10.400
Have to acknowledge the possible consequences from appearing on the show when you have individuals like sexy vegan

06:10.400 --> 06:15.040
They do seem slightly irredeemable some things cannot be cured but children are different for me

06:15.040 --> 06:18.180
They do not have the ability to reason whether they want to go on the show

06:18.180 --> 06:21.360
They may not be able to acknowledge the consequences at a certain age

06:21.360 --> 06:25.320
And if there is a clear disparity with how children are coming out of the program

06:25.320 --> 06:30.160
And it appears not to be effective in the long term then it may be right to address it and listen

06:30.160 --> 06:31.220
I haven't watched dr. Phil

06:31.220 --> 06:37.940
So I don't know if there's anything stated specifically statistical about that but printed information seems to be a rarity over the effectiveness

06:38.040 --> 06:43.760
Going on public TV under such psychological circumstances can be stressful. It can be positive

06:43.760 --> 06:46.760
It can be negative and it's clear there needs to be more evidence

06:46.760 --> 06:49.480
But I don't think that should stop dialogue or at least prevent

06:49.840 --> 06:57.000
Situations like Danielle Bregoli from spiraling out of control because whatever part of her was salvageable has been thoroughly tested

06:57.160 --> 07:02.720
Thanks to the evolving media and I don't think that a child should be put on blast for entertainment value alone

07:02.720 --> 07:08.340
What do you think are there any avid dr. Phil viewers out there? Do we have any interesting statistics?

07:08.340 --> 07:13.800
I'd be very inclined to hear because I've googled it and it's just not there apart from you know

07:13.800 --> 07:15.920
The normal journalistic article saying dr

07:15.920 --> 07:21.400
Phil is evil and has a human zoo and that's all very biased and I don't want to just base it on that

07:21.400 --> 07:26.040
But I'd love to hear I'm kind of torn. Maybe you can persuade me anyhow until the next one

07:26.040 --> 07:28.100
I'm the right opinion and I'll see you then
