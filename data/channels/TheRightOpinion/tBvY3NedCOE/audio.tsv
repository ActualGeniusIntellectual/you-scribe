0	2000	Hey you guys.
2000	6000	Word on the screen is that there's a girl out there who thinks she's black.
6000	8000	A girl named Woah Vicky.
8000	9000	Woah Vicky.
9000	10000	Woah Vicky.
10000	11000	Woah Vicky.
11000	14000	If I enjoy this shit, I'ma eat this shit like I enjoy it.
14000	18000	A young girl who thinks she's black or a fuck.
18000	19000	You're not black.
19000	20000	Get that through her head.
20000	23000	And I want you to free all my hitters in the chain gang.
24000	26000	An enigma in many ways.
26000	30000	But, what is behind the persona?
31000	35000	Today, we'll try and find out.
39000	44000	Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time.
44000	47000	And honestly, for today's video, we're gonna do something a little different.
47000	49000	We're gonna go back to the retrospectives.
49000	52000	I'm not gonna lie, I haven't been feeling great of recent,
52000	55000	in the last few months I've been covering recent drama more and more,
55000	59000	because for the first time in a while there has been a lot of current situations going down.
59000	63000	But at the end of the day, that doesn't mean that there aren't some really intriguing stories
63000	66000	that many have left behind that I still think are worth talking about.
66000	71000	Not just because they may be interesting, but because they may have left perceptions that are worth challenging.
71000	76000	So today we're going to wade into one of the most unique stories of a cultural manifestation there is,
76000	80000	and talk about someone who at a time of sensitivity caused so much controversy.
80000	82000	Yet, no one really took seriously.
82000	84000	That person is Woah Vicky.
84000	87000	Woah Vicky, originally branded as Victoria Waldrip,
87000	93000	is the YouTube phenomenon that could only be the product of the post-2016 reality that we appear to live in now.
93000	96000	I don't remember where I was when I discovered Woah Vicky,
96000	100000	but it's clear that honestly I was completely fine with not being able to completely remember,
100000	103000	because Victoria here had a persona that was rather hard to forget.
103000	106000	In fact, I did cover her in a video a long time ago,
106000	108000	back when I was making much shorter videos,
108000	111000	however, I don't really think I provided too much nuance
111000	116000	rather than arguing that, shock horror, Woah Vicky is an African American.
116000	118000	Now, if this is the first time you've heard of this character,
118000	122000	you may wonder why on earth I would have to argue such a presumed thesis.
122000	125000	What would I do next, argue that Arnold Schwarzenegger is Austrian?
125000	132000	Who on earth would argue that such a character is not identical as an ethnicity that they seemingly appeared to not represent?
133000	140000	Yes, my birthday is March 7th, but July 19th was the day I found out I was black.
140000	145000	Ah yes, Vicky herself. That was what of course made her rather infamous.
145000	149000	You see, in the summer of 17, when we should have all been enjoying the sunny weather,
149000	154000	storm clowns began to form, this presence on Twitter, and Instagram, and YouTube,
154000	158000	this character, who openly used sensitive words rather liberally,
158000	161000	and justified it under the notion of her racial identity,
161000	164000	and then presumed to take this further, and further, and further.
164000	169000	Through this provocative behaviour, she quickly gathered a following from a variety of individuals.
169000	174000	I assume some people genuinely liked her, but many were also there to just dish out heavy criticism,
174000	179000	and to clown on her whenever she decided to provide her less than nuanced input on matters of race.
179000	184000	Through this, she quickly gained infamy, with much of this attention, whether positive or negative,
184000	185000	snowballing into publicity.
185000	190000	After all, white girl thinks she's black is arguably some of the best YouTube clickbait,
190000	194000	and also it's an easy topic that people love to jump in on, because although socially loaded,
194000	197000	no one's gonna really call you out for making fun of her.
197000	199000	But why the hunger? Why the desire?
199000	204000	Because although the appeal could be observed, what made people suddenly want to turn to her?
204000	207000	I've spoken about this before in my rather old Lil Tay video,
207000	211000	but there is this show called Dr. Phil, it's basically aimed to be a more therapeutic,
211000	216000	professional version of shows such as Jerry Springer, the pyrocynical to your leafy per se.
216000	221000	On Dr. Phil, he often invites a multitude of guests on who are undergoing conflict within their lives,
221000	224000	whether that be between their friends, family, or themselves.
224000	229000	It will often escalate with dispute, with Phil attempting to take a more mediating position,
229000	231000	and attempting to provide some form of counseling.
231000	235000	This has had its fair share of criticism in the past, and maybe I'll dissect that one day,
235000	240000	but for now, there is one episode that I think is quite important to focus our attention on,
240000	243000	and it is of course the episode that includes Danielle Bregoli.
243000	251000	First uploaded to YouTube in August 2016, it gradually gained traction and coverage over the following months.
251000	256000	Whenever watching it, you feel a strange sadness knowing that this was what our society had come to.
256000	260000	However, this sadness didn't really sink in for me personally until a few months later,
260000	263000	when her tweets started to seep onto my timeline.
263000	266000	The ones where she was flexing about how much money she was making,
266000	271000	a girl famous for being aggressive, unpleasant, toxic, and all around culturally clueless,
271000	277000	and there I was, a sad student in university, doing his best not to lose his sanity with absolutely nothing.
277000	281000	Turns out all I had to do was become as trashy and clueless as her.
281000	285000	So I started up my Twitch channel, The Twerking Opinion, where I shook my ass for that sweet, sweet dollar.
285000	291000	It did well, but it died shortly after, and I terminated it, because you don't really want people finding that stuff.
291000	294000	I jest, I jest, or do I?
295000	301000	Anyhow, although trashiness was nothing new, it became clear that there was a relatively new craving for it,
301000	307000	particularly in the idea of clickbait reaction content that just took any crazy people doing crazy weird things,
307000	309000	particularly girls, you perverts.
309000	316000	I'm not sure exactly what phase we were in, but whatever it was, it created young internet sensations in probably the worst way possible.
316000	320000	Woah Vicky was definitely a continuation in this story,
320000	325000	but I've always viewed this trend as a train of sorts, that many people just got on and got off,
325000	329000	whether it was convenient for them, or whether they were genuinely caught up in their own antics,
329000	333000	often being accelerated by commentators and audiences alike.
333000	339000	Woah Vicky definitely embodies one of these people, but no one really stopped to ask exactly what was happening,
339000	348000	why it was happening, and why it was Woah Vicky who decided to take on the burden of being this punching bag.
348000	353000	If Vicky isn't the African American person she always wanted to present herself as, who was she?
353000	356000	Who is she? What were her motivations?
356000	360000	The simple clout story is always one that satisfies our judgemental nature,
360000	363000	but it has to be a bit deeper than that, because let's face it,
363000	368000	I assume most people watching this video wouldn't have stooped to that level for the sake of views.
368000	371000	So I think it's time for some theory, and you know what?
371000	375000	After having a bit of research, I think I might just have a story for you today.
375000	380000	So the plan will be to definitively explain the nature of Vicky's persona, starting at her channel's origins,
380000	384000	although it's clear that a fair proportion of her persona is rather contrived,
384000	389000	I want to see if we can be more specific about how much is fabricated and why it would be fabricated,
389000	395000	what we can really say about the story behind this character, and how she has moved forward to the present day.
395000	399000	This would be pointless if it was just an exaggerated persona, but I don't feel that's the case,
399000	404000	and given how offensive she was, I understand why some people may feel strangely towards her,
404000	409000	but I don't know, she never rattled me as much as I might have expected her to,
409000	411000	and I think that feeling comes from somewhere.
411000	415000	So today I want to dive into that feeling and see what else we can find,
415000	418000	providing you are ready of course, which I assume you are,
418000	423000	though maybe you've left the video on and you've gone off to have a shower and you just like the sound of my voice in the background,
423000	426000	which is fine too, I don't have any problems there either.
426000	429000	Let us enter the realm of Woah Vicky.
430000	448000	I'm sure you've heard Woah Vicky referred to as her full name a few times, Victoria Wardrip.
448000	453000	Now this may be done for the sake of formality, and maybe just to emphasise how white she actually is,
453000	458000	however it's important to note that when she began her channel, that's how she branded herself.
458000	463000	Oh yes, the amateur vlog filters were in fashion for this classic Victoria Wardrip vlog.
463000	467000	Now funnily enough, from that period, a lot of her videos have been removed from her main channel,
467000	472000	however this one is one that actually Vicky feels can still represent her to this day.
472000	477000	The video exhibits one quite iconic element that would become prominent in her future content, her accent,
477000	483000	however it doesn't actually show an awareness of how daft many of us considered it sounding at the time.
483000	488000	We're about to get on the train.
488000	490000	Yeah, the train.
490000	494000	Yeah, and we just went through the baggage claim and all that.
494000	500000	In fact, this video is a very casual vlog of her going on holiday with her friends to the Dominican Republic.
500000	507000	Nothing is really particularly out of the ordinary, in fact, the sort of tone conveyed is a girl enjoying herself on holiday with her friends.
507000	512000	It's almost as if the accent is only noticeable to those who are actually watching the YouTube video,
512000	515000	as everyone else seems completely unfazed.
515000	520000	However, as many of you I'm sure are aware, Vicky's presence on the platform precedes her own YouTube channel.
520000	525000	Before the press attention, she had another appearance on a channel with someone known as Virgin JJ,
525000	528000	Lil JJ, whatever he's going by now.
528000	532000	Apparently now he's going by the name of Lil Rot, her then boyfriend.
532000	536000	In this video, they answer various questions regarding their relationship.
536000	542000	Nothing particular of interest comes up, just them flexing about how much they are in love for a bit and how much money they have.
542000	545000	There is, however, this one very interesting comment.
545000	548000	Why do you only like white girls?
548000	551000	Why do I only like white girls?
551000	554000	I'm not white, I'm mixed.
554000	556000	Yeah, she's Spanish and white.
556000	557000	English and Spanish, eh?
557000	561000	Although the assertion that she isn't white was also stated within the video,
561000	567000	I assume that it may have dawned on them that being Spanish is actually a nationality, not actually a race.
567000	571000	On top of this, most Spanish individuals would consider themselves Caucasian.
571000	576000	That is, of course, with reference that the definition of Spanish is hailing from the country of Spain,
576000	579000	and not to be confused with those who may consider themselves Hispanic,
579000	581000	although there is a racial discussion regarding that too.
581000	589000	What this also provides interest to was the fact that she divulged that this racial revelation comes from the fact that her father is, in fact, mixed race.
589000	593000	How do your parents feel about you dating a black man?
593000	594000	Satisfied?
594000	595000	Yeah.
595000	596000	Satisfied?
596000	601000	Um, my dad's not white, so he don't care.
601000	605000	This is a narrative that she came back to reference on multiple occasions.
605000	609000	Now, her father is a bloke by the name of Steve Waldrop, his parents were Marvin and Louise.
609000	613000	They were also both born in Georgia to seemingly white backgrounds.
613000	617000	Although, of course, it is unclear what the heritage of such family members would be.
617000	622000	That is, information that obviously only the family would and really should have the access to.
622000	628000	However, when you're the only person who is privy to that information, it means that you can perceptibly own the narrative,
628000	630000	as implausible as it might seem.
630000	633000	In months following this, a new narrative was concocted,
633000	640000	that basically she had done some historical research of her own and found out that she was, in fact, 25% black.
640000	645000	This then gave her access to the copious amounts of privileges that came with being an African American citizen,
645000	648000	such as the glorious N-word pass.
655000	656000	Who is giving this girl a career?
656000	658000	She was very proud of that one.
658000	663000	It also gave her complete access to indulge in all the memes about African American culture,
663000	665000	which was certainly unique.
665000	670000	And last, I'mma teach y'all how to swim, like a real n***a.
671000	674000	Of course, she still retains her regular appearance and legal name,
674000	680000	so she seems exempt from any of the negative racial profiling that may actually come with appearing African American,
680000	686000	but hey, who cares about that when you can make that epic meme about African American life?
686000	688000	People swimming, am I right?
688000	694000	When challenged on this, she posted further screenshots that allegedly showed that she was, in fact, 44% black,
694000	698000	and therefore even more African American than we initially thought,
698000	701000	if we ignore the small print that reads thousands of years ago, of course,
701000	707000	and in fact, now Vicky has constructed a watertight case on how she is actually African American
707000	710000	and has clear membership to this exclusive club.
710000	713000	Now, I wanted to take a brief aside to clear up some information here,
713000	716000	although most of this story is rather clear.
716000	720000	We know that Vicky is an African American, I want to assert that.
720000	727000	But for all I know, Victoria Waldrop may have deep heritage from the plains of Africa if you go back far enough,
727000	729000	I mean, a lot of people do.
729000	733000	But one of the greatest myths that even some prolific individuals have fallen foul to today
733000	736000	is the idea that you can prove race with a genetics test.
736000	740000	You can't, you can prove a lot, and you may even find people in your family tree
740000	745000	who would have been identified as a different race at that time, and then try and derive that.
745000	750000	But the race that you are perceived of is strictly within the context of society,
750000	754000	and no genetic test can change that unless society then asserts that,
754000	758000	which would then have to be asserted consistently across the whole society,
758000	760000	which is just completely impractical.
760000	764000	Vicky also stated that she will be the one who decides what race she belongs to,
764000	767000	and if she says she's black, then she is black, which once again,
767000	771000	there is inconsistency within society of how people understand race,
771000	775000	but generally there is a declaring that if you're appearing a certain identity,
775000	778000	then you don't really have the liberty to claim you're anything else,
778000	782000	particularly in societies that may have serious baggage with those identities.
782000	787000	There are exceptions to that, a good example would be the late politician Augustus Hawkins,
787000	792000	who was fair-skinned, but came from a highly familial, predominant African-American background,
792000	794000	and thus identified as that.
794000	797000	But that's a nuance that I'm sure many people can understand,
797000	800000	and one that Vicky definitely didn't have access to.
800000	803000	However, this was an attitude that did not just arise from nowhere,
803000	807000	with all due respect, it's clear that Vicky was not the sharpest knife in the draw,
807000	810000	I doubt she would be applying for Mensa anytime soon,
810000	813000	and although she deserves some accountability for her antics,
813000	817000	I always felt it must run a bit deeper than just her.
817000	819000	I'm one of these white folks, okay?
831000	835000	The strangest realisation that I have come to accept in my study was that,
835000	842000	whether exaggerated or not, it is quite likely that that is Vicky's real voice,
842000	844000	or at least Vicky believes it is.
844000	848000	There's this expectation that one day Vicky's gonna open her mouth and talk normally,
848000	852000	and we'll just hear this high school basic white girl accent blurt out,
852000	855000	but I actually highly doubt at this point.
855000	859000	Accents are not genetic, they are definitely influenced by the society around us,
859000	861000	depending on how easily influenced we are,
861000	866000	and Vicky gives me the sort of idea of someone who may be a bit impressionable here and there.
866000	869000	There is a lot of talk about Vicky's past on the run up to YouTube,
869000	872000	and it seems that it has been turbulent for many reasons.
872000	876000	There was a 30 minute interview conducted by the man himself, Michael McCrudden,
876000	879000	with Woah Vicky, but unfortunately that has been lost to the vaults,
879000	882000	and doesn't appear as if it will be recovered.
882000	884000	However, we are aware that she is a school dropout,
884000	888000	and didn't have the best time at school or after school.
888000	890000	I used to be really bad, I used to always sneak out,
890000	893000	I used to be with the wrong crowd,
893000	895000	I used to cop for stealing a few times,
895000	897000	I was fighting all the time,
897000	900000	I used to sneak boys in the house,
900000	904000	yeah, I was like, this was when I was like 13, 14,
904000	905000	but this school ain't no little better.
905000	911000	She was also raised in a rather broken household with her mother before being transferred to her father.
911000	914000	So how I grew up was, okay so,
914000	917000	I lived with my mom until I was seven, right?
917000	921000	I thought this other guy was my dad that she was with, well not even with,
921000	923000	that had kind of raised me,
923000	925000	and I grew up with them so I was like six or seven,
925000	930000	and then what had happened was my mom, she was like a little alcoholic or whatever,
930000	934000	so then I had to go live with my dad,
934000	937000	once I would have went to the D, what's it called?
937000	940000	The foster home?
940000	942000	Defects? They're called defects, whatever.
942000	946000	They're like, oh, you're not capable of living with this lady and this guy is not your dad,
946000	950000	so you want her to go here, and then they're like, wait, she has a dad, whoop-de-whoop.
950000	953000	And this is all interesting information that I want to keep in mind.
953000	958000	Another interesting clip I want to show is a rant around mid-2017
958000	964000	by her then ex-boyfriend who made claims about her social life and her, quote, real behaviour.
964000	967000	She used to walk out 4am in the morning, bro.
967000	971000	4am in the morning, come back at 7, like, bro, who do that, bro?
971000	973000	I don't know what she be on, nigga,
974000	979000	but to me, that sounds like some demonic possession type, you feel me?
979000	982000	And then on top of that, bro, she claims she from Zone 6, bro.
982000	984000	You are not from Zone 6, my nigga.
984000	986000	You are not. You from Buckhead, nigga.
986000	989000	That's one of the richest parts in Atlanta, but get out of here, bro.
989000	992000	You from Buckhead? How you gonna say you from Zone 6?
992000	994000	Bro, get out of here, bro. That's lame as freak.
994000	999000	So, bro, she thinks she's black, bro.
999000	1002000	She thinks he's black, bro.
1003000	1006000	You're not black. Stop trying to be black, bro.
1006000	1008000	Stop. This foolish, bro.
1008000	1011000	Stop trying to be black. You're not black.
1011000	1013000	You are not black, bro.
1013000	1016000	I got video. I got footage of everything.
1016000	1019000	Yo, mom, bro, I can expose so much videos of you, Vicky, bro.
1019000	1022000	You're not black. Stop trying to be black, bro.
1022000	1024000	Bro, I even asked her this one time, bro.
1024000	1027000	I was like, can you talk? What? Can you talk proper?
1027000	1030000	Can you talk? Please talk proper for one time, bro.
1030000	1032000	All I asked was once, and guess what she said?
1032000	1034000	What that mean?
1034000	1037000	Like, come on, bro. You know how to talk proper, bro.
1037000	1041000	You was a gothic. You got picked on in middle school, bro.
1041000	1043000	You was a goth, my nigga.
1043000	1046000	Like, bro, come on, bro. You know you can talk.
1046000	1048000	You know you can talk proper, bro.
1048000	1050000	You know you can talk proper English, bro.
1050000	1052000	You know you can, bro. You know it in your heart.
1052000	1055000	Like, stop. You trying to be somebody else? You not, bro.
1055000	1059000	Now, I'm not playing this clip as proof or with the idea that I actually believe him here.
1059000	1063000	I am playing it for a few reasons, some that I want to go into detail now,
1063000	1065000	and some that I will save for later.
1065000	1069000	July 2017 is when all this began to kick off, particularly on Instagram,
1069000	1072000	which was when she was noticed by the likes of Danielle Bregoli,
1072000	1075000	and then became involved in very strange, bizarre disputes,
1075000	1079000	provoking threats of fights and the rest, in laughably unaware fashion.
1080000	1086000	Bad hair, baby. Bad bitch. Your city's fake as fuck, bitch.
1086000	1089000	Now, though clearly a rather exceptional situation,
1089000	1094000	Bregoli's trashy girl antics always made sense as an outcome of the environment
1094000	1096000	that she clearly hadn't responded well to.
1096000	1101000	Although clearly tormented as an individual, and with probably a genuinely sad story in how it came to be,
1101000	1104000	she also had a natural antagonistic attitude.
1104000	1107000	This never seemed to be the complete case for Vicky,
1107000	1110000	outside obviously proclaiming that she was African American,
1110000	1115000	she came across as rather clumsy, and not really fitting the persona that she appeared to have chosen.
1115000	1117000	Now, in this situation, there are two main causes for this,
1117000	1120000	either a person is completely putting it on for the sake of clout,
1120000	1123000	or that they genuinely believe that this is who they're meant to be,
1123000	1127000	but they're just completely lost as to how they're meant to portray themselves,
1127000	1129000	and end up looking a bit silly.
1129000	1133000	With all this in mind, it's very easy to say that someone claiming they're black is clearly faking it,
1133000	1136000	and in many ways, I do believe that she doesn't believe that.
1136000	1139000	However, one of the things that I always noticed about Woah Vicky
1139000	1143000	is that she was often seen socialising with many people from a variety of backgrounds,
1143000	1148000	and it reminded me of a personal experience many years ago, one involving yours truly.
1148000	1151000	Back when I was around 12, I didn't have too many friends,
1151000	1156000	in fact, I was at a stage between schools, and at my previous school I regularly had social issues,
1156000	1159000	so I doubted I was going to stay in contact with anyone there.
1159000	1162000	However, there was a summer camp that I used to come by at the school,
1162000	1166000	this was a camp that at this point primarily hailed from Turkey,
1166000	1168000	and given that I regularly went to the school with my dad,
1168000	1171000	as it also doubled as a sports facility in the holidays,
1171000	1174000	I became involved with many of these Turkish students.
1174000	1178000	One of the things that I remember doing was putting on an Eurasian accent
1178000	1180000	to feel more integrated and accepted,
1180000	1184000	as someone who had been ostracised fairly regularly for being different at a time,
1184000	1187000	I guess my mind told me to minimise that difference,
1187000	1193000	in hindsight it was a fairly daft idea, but it was what I did to be accepted in that moment.
1193000	1199000	Obviously the Turkish camp left, and at the end of the day they were very culturally different to who I was,
1199000	1202000	but what if they'd stayed, what if I'd gone back to Turkey with them?
1202000	1203000	How would I have grown up?
1203000	1206000	If the stories about social difficulties were correct,
1206000	1209000	then it's probable that she probably just wanted a way to fit in with people,
1209000	1213000	however sometimes when you're desperate you'll find any way to fit in,
1213000	1216000	and that may come with its own risks and changes.
1216000	1221000	It seems that she found solace with a certain culture that she associated with African Americans,
1221000	1224000	maybe through the people who were friends with her,
1224000	1227000	maybe through her relationship with little extra virgin oil,
1227000	1230000	however at the same time, because she wasn't African American herself,
1230000	1235000	she wanted to strive for inclusion on the basis of a status that she knew she couldn't obtain,
1235000	1239000	but wanted to obtain nonetheless, and maybe for them it felt better to validate her,
1239000	1242000	and hey, if you're friends with her, there were palatial benefits too,
1242000	1246000	as it's known Vicky was living in a rather excessively wealthy family,
1246000	1249000	her father's side of the family had been involved in the real estate business,
1249000	1253000	the most quintessentially American job alongside owning a car dealership,
1253000	1259000	and that would obviously be attractive for those who may be interested in developing a friendship or relationship with her.
1259000	1262000	Now I have no comment for any specific individuals involved,
1262000	1265000	I have no doubt that many people were genuinely friends with her for who she was,
1265000	1270000	but given the behaviour of some, it became clear that eventually this sort of codependent relationship was developed,
1271000	1276000	particularly on social media, one where Vicky wanted to spend time around people who gave her credibility,
1276000	1280000	and many sought to be friends with her because of that growing social media presence.
1280000	1285000	Her then ex-boyfriend who had released that video completely trashing her demeanour as fake and put on,
1285000	1287000	would soon be back together with Victoria,
1287000	1292000	and defending her behaviour in some of the honestly most humiliating clips I've seen.
1292000	1296000	The majority of black people cannot swim because their skin is black,
1296000	1299000	and I think it's a racial trait.
1299000	1305000	People say she's not black, but like at the end of the day she took an ancestry test and her results came in,
1305000	1307000	like, results don't lie.
1307000	1309000	This environment that had began to surround Woah Vicky,
1309000	1312000	had basically started this weird chain reaction,
1312000	1316000	where acceptance on the inside turned to publication on the outside,
1316000	1319000	maybe in her inner circles people were happy to go along with it,
1319000	1322000	whatever she wanted to say, and that validated her enough.
1322000	1325000	Many people seemed to defend her in her friend group,
1325000	1327000	whether they were going along with the act or not.
1327000	1330000	However, as soon as she moved outside of that friend group,
1330000	1334000	she was met with hostility from parties who had no stake in supporting her assertions.
1334000	1339000	She was almost stood in the eye of a hurricane of criticism with her friends around her.
1339000	1342000	This led to her going further, and further, and further,
1342000	1344000	and maybe her parents should have stepped in too,
1344000	1348000	but they were probably just happy that she'd found the limelight in the validation
1348000	1350000	that she had maybe been denied in the past.
1350000	1354000	As noted in another one of her videos, it was better than her previous options,
1354000	1358000	but the best of a bad bunch doesn't necessarily mean good,
1358000	1361000	and it was about to devolve pretty badly.
1361000	1381000	Now I must add that I'm not saying Vicky was completely unaware that she was not black,
1381000	1386000	she clearly knew, and she clearly knowingly lied about details such as being quote from the six.
1386000	1389000	I think those details were mainly for the sake of provocation,
1389000	1392000	but they worked, people were provoked, and at the same time,
1392000	1396000	facing down that level of hostility, you need some people to support you,
1396000	1398000	you need some people to enable you,
1398000	1402000	and people around her clearly encouraged her to indulge in that persona,
1402000	1405000	to make these rather embarrassing videos that have now been deleted.
1405000	1406000	No surprise there.
1406000	1409000	This is the lingo.
1409000	1414000	See you later, Day Day, see y'all niggas at the cookout.
1414000	1418000	This is what happens when everyone on the inside is telling you that you're doing the right thing
1418000	1421000	and everyone on the outside is telling you you're doing the wrong thing.
1421000	1423000	I've dealt with this concept before.
1423000	1429000	For some people, it might be easy to tell that these outside voices are just as valid as those on the inside.
1429000	1433000	However, at the same time, we are always much more ready to value advice from friends,
1433000	1436000	particularly if we feel there's a stake in keeping those friends.
1436000	1440000	There are many valid reasons for this, they understand the circumstances and context
1440000	1442000	that might serve better advice in the long term,
1442000	1447000	and therefore, as a commentator on these matters, when I provide my own personal thoughts,
1447000	1452000	I accept that I often do it from a level of distance that means that there may be context that I'm not aware of,
1452000	1456000	but at the same time, that doesn't necessarily mean I shouldn't provide my thoughts,
1456000	1460000	or my advice is invalid, because it might just be what they need to realise
1460000	1464000	that actually the advice that they're receiving from those close to them isn't actually the best,
1464000	1467000	and is going to hurt them more in the long term.
1467000	1469000	When you're on the roller coaster alongside Woah Vicky,
1469000	1472000	it might feel good to tell her to keep that ride going,
1472000	1475000	to keep behaving provocatively, to continue that madness.
1475000	1479000	Fantastic idea, it's great attention, you'll receive plenty of coverage,
1479000	1482000	probably a fair bit of money here and there, you can probably sell merch,
1482000	1484000	maybe have your own app, easy dollar,
1484000	1489000	but ultimately, when you have no one to stop you, you'll have a rude awakening when you go too far,
1489000	1492000	and that's exactly what happened with Victoria here,
1492000	1495000	though admittedly, it was a slow, gradual process,
1495000	1498000	but it still started in 2017.
1498000	1502000	I must emphasise that, we are still in that timeline.
1502000	1506000	Now, the publicity of her rather daft statements were finally beginning to come back to her,
1506000	1509000	the memes were being made out of her claiming she was black,
1509000	1513000	and it made it back to commentators, people began to make videos on her antics,
1513000	1516000	including me, though, as always, I was rather late,
1516000	1518000	and threw it in with another person, Martina Bigg,
1518000	1521000	who in hindsight was a very different case to that of Victoria,
1521000	1525000	but anyway, the largest creator who became involved in this was RiceGum.
1526000	1530000	RiceGum, who whomever fucks, he is like,
1530000	1532000	bruh, you coming for me?
1532000	1535000	But you can't offend me, bruh, because you ain't black, bruh.
1535000	1540000	Now, at this point, we were still in the I'm black phase of Woah Vicky's character,
1540000	1543000	it should be very clear that this was a bit of a plea for attention,
1543000	1546000	this is exactly the same thing that she said to Danielle Bregoli,
1546000	1550000	you can't say this word, but I can, because I'm actually black.
1550000	1553000	She knows it provokes, and people view it as ridiculous,
1553000	1556000	but you know, if it makes a good video, why not give it a try?
1556000	1559000	RiceGum reacts to it with all the conviction of a failed lawsuit,
1559000	1563000	and provides more attention to someone who frankly did not really deserve it.
1563000	1567000	However hell-bent on maximising the attention out of this confrontation,
1567000	1570000	Vicky decided to take direct aim at RiceGum.
1570000	1573000	What was she gonna say about him? How was she gonna diss him?
1573000	1576000	What sort of dynamic content would she come up with?
1583000	1586000	Ching chong, ching chong, ching chong, bitch.
1589000	1593000	Ah yes, ching chong, ching chong, ching chong, bitch.
1593000	1598000	RiceGum must be really quaking in his boots, and you know, it was rather pathetic.
1598000	1601000	Although it might have been a nice little stunt for attention,
1601000	1604000	YouTube didn't appreciate it as much, and removed it fairly promptly,
1604000	1608000	likely due to the mass reports by RiceGum viewers above them actually caring.
1608000	1612000	She then later responded by posting a statement to the Asian community saying,
1612000	1617000	please don't take offence as it was only specifically directed towards RiceGum, and not anyone else.
1617000	1620000	There was also another statement that she made on her Instagram saying
1620000	1624000	that in fact she found Asian guys very attractive and that they should DM her.
1624000	1627000	The whole music video was profoundly embarrassing,
1627000	1630000	but what was hilarious was the number of people surrounding her
1630000	1633000	who must have thought in their head that this was a good idea.
1633000	1639000	Aside from the song being terrible, this made it through filming, production, editing, and subsequent upload,
1639000	1643000	with no one really stepping in and saying, this is terrible, this is awful.
1643000	1647000	It made it through with the endorsement of basically everyone, I assume.
1647000	1649000	All for a drop of clout.
1649000	1655000	And it wasn't necessarily anything new, after all she's been going around claiming that she's a completely different race.
1655000	1659000	However, it was the descent to a new low, the beginning of a slippery slope
1659000	1665000	that would demonstrate if no one was going to stop her, then she wasn't really prepared to stop herself.
1665000	1668000	That's what happens when we become over-invested in a persona.
1668000	1674000	We lose grip on our own reality and the perceptions people have outside our own echo chambers,
1674000	1676000	and how people in the real world actually react.
1696000	1699000	This didn't mean that she didn't try and flesh out her character.
1699000	1704000	As mentioned earlier, she had an ongoing dispute or beef with Danielle Bregoli,
1704000	1707000	and Danielle Bregoli is someone equally loathed amongst the community,
1707000	1711000	but the beef at least had a second dimension to their characters.
1711000	1716000	Woah Vicky was probably aware that Race Provocation was a brand that was going to become pretty stale quickly,
1716000	1721000	so needed to switch it up, and to be honest, Bregoli was probably in that mindset of feuds being good too.
1721000	1724000	So this beef served as reinforcement for that relevance.
1724000	1731000	Over the winter months of 2017 going into 2018, she grasped onto her reputation through reaction videos,
1731000	1734000	regular provocation, and actual interviews.
1734000	1742000	Yeah, I feel like college is like a scam, and like they just try to get money.
1742000	1749000	Well like, yeah it's a scam because college teaches you how to work for people,
1749000	1753000	and most people that's successful, you don't need college, you feel me?
1754000	1759000	Honestly, I might be inclined to agree to an extent, I have my own criticisms of college,
1759000	1764000	although I would add that Woah Vicky might actually be the best advertisement for it.
1764000	1769000	By the start of 2018, her social media presence had ground to a rather slow hole.
1769000	1774000	In December, her Instagram was deleted, and basically she became a punchline,
1774000	1776000	rather than having any actual presence of her own.
1776000	1782000	This is always what happens to people who do this, they are addicted to that high that flash of attention can provide,
1782000	1787000	but therefore have to engage in more and more antics to retain the audience's attention,
1787000	1791000	but she was beginning to sound like a broken record, nothing was fresh,
1791000	1794000	and she had to escalate the antics even more,
1794000	1798000	and probably pushed on by a group of peers who didn't have their dignity at stake,
1798000	1803000	she did what many people in her position did, she went deeper and deeper,
1803000	1806000	and this led to worse and worse results.
1807000	1814000	When you do stuff with the attention, the attention in the moment might feel good,
1814000	1820000	if you've cultivated that reputation as that crazy girl who's just out of control, then who cares?
1820000	1823000	If you'll expect that from you anyway, how else should you behave?
1823000	1827000	I mean, if you tried to change it, then it would just compromise that reputation,
1827000	1831000	that you've worked so hard to cultivate, right? Wouldn't it?
1831000	1835000	As mentioned in numerous other videos, such hype does not sustain itself,
1835000	1840000	and Woah Vicky's gimmick was never particularly deep and was running out of gas rather rapidly,
1840000	1846000	yet she felt constrained by her already existent reputation, and didn't want to run the hype to empty.
1846000	1851000	However, once the gas runs out, you're left with the fact that you made the headlines very briefly for outlandish behaviour,
1851000	1856000	that by this point you'd hope would not represent you, yet the people who see you will remember you for that,
1856000	1861000	sometimes you can argue your way out of it, as someone who is a victim of a brief spotlight not chosen by them,
1861000	1867000	but people like Vicky were seen as indulgent of that reputation, and constantly clawing for the spotlight once more,
1867000	1871000	which meant that their cases often came across as even less sympathetic.
1871000	1875000	The start of 2018 was definitely where everything began to hit rock bottom for Vicky,
1875000	1881000	with three specific incidents that I think really outlined the slope into oblivion that she had decided to embark on.
1881000	1885000	As said, it's hard enough for the public to forget about the reputation that you might give yourself,
1885000	1890000	however, there's one institution with an even better memory, that is of course the legal system.
1890000	1897000	Once you're in their bad books, they will never forget, and it's something that will be brought up when conducting routine actions,
1897000	1901000	such as applying for jobs, applying for visas, you want a clean record,
1901000	1906000	particularly if the persona that you're renowned for being won't sustain itself online.
1906000	1909000	I don't really think I'm black, I'm black, I'm black.
1909000	1913000	In January, she came to the top realisation that she may not actually be black,
1913000	1916000	and this clearly had an emotional toll on her.
1916000	1920000	Well, you know, I joke, but basically the next few months were undoubtedly awful,
1920000	1926000	and were mostly spent trying to recapture relevance through attention that no one else was really that willing to provide.
1926000	1931000	However, I can't fault her for trying, but I will fault her for everything else that followed.
1932000	1935000	Why are you doing that to her? Get off of her!
1935000	1937000	Get off of her!
1937000	1939000	Get off of her!
1939000	1941000	Get off of her!
1941000	1943000	Get off her like that!
1943000	1945000	Get off her like that!
1945000	1947000	Get off her like that!
1947000	1949000	Get off her like that!
1949000	1951000	Get off her like that!
1951000	1953000	Get off her like that!
1953000	1955000	Get off her like that!
1955000	1957000	Get off her like that!
1957000	1959000	Get off her like that!
1959000	1961000	Get off her like that!
1961000	1963000	Get off her like that!
1963000	1968000	In February 2018, she was arrested for allegedly causing a disturbance with a police officer.
1968000	1973000	Apparently, she was asked to depart from a department store, and she did not oblige,
1973000	1977000	and then more security became involved, and she resisted, and then the police were involved,
1977000	1979000	and this led to her arrest.
1979000	1983000	It doesn't seem like there was a serious conviction, maybe because she was a minor,
1983000	1985000	maybe because the report isn't as it seemed.
1985000	1987000	It's not my place to comment on that part,
1987000	1991000	but it seems likely that Woah Vicky's attitude was quickly following through onto her real life,
1991000	1997000	and as noted, once the line between your enabled persona and the real repercussions that your behaviour has becomes blurred,
1997000	2001000	well, you lose your grip on the consequences that you may face.
2001000	2005000	Despite the embarrassment and the nature of such an incident, she didn't really gain much attention from it.
2005000	2011000	Her new Instagram was gradually gaining back followers, but certainly not at the rate someone with a milly would have hoped for.
2011000	2013000	Then in the following month came the rise of Lil Tay.
2013000	2019000	I spoke about her a while back, but she was basically the product of a culture that really should have been put to a stop then and there.
2019000	2025000	The obsession of that contrast between innocent and sweet, and braggadocious and aggressive and basically hood.
2025000	2030000	People just love to see that sort of gangster talk come from someone who really shouldn't be saying it.
2030000	2034000	At the same time, she also completely exposed how calculated the whole appeal was.
2034000	2037000	She was someone who was completely being used.
2037000	2041000	Unlike Vicky, who was a seventeen year old, and still blissfully ignorant mind you,
2041000	2046000	Lil Tay was a kid who should have been doing other things outside of posting videos flexing online.
2046000	2049000	That sort of attention would never be good for a nine year old.
2049000	2053000	With Lil Tay, Daniel Bregoli, and all these other characters joining in these feuds,
2053000	2058000	Woah Vicky was part of this absurd harebrained Marvel universe,
2058000	2062000	and although there were people invested, it certainly wasn't for the right reasons.
2062000	2064000	It was basically who could hit a new low.
2064000	2068000	A lot of the time, these people were calling out some general concept of the haters,
2068000	2072000	who probably didn't exist until any of them actually started posting those videos.
2072000	2076000	However, eventually, with the existent beat between Daniel and Vicky,
2076000	2079000	this escalated with the introduction of new characters.
2079000	2083000	Vicky turned eighteen on the seventh of March 2018,
2083000	2086000	and therefore she was at that point legally an adult.
2086000	2090000	It would be barely a month before this would further escalate in Glendale, California,
2090000	2094000	where Vicky and Daniel finally had their long anticipated showdown.
2095000	2096000	You wanna run somewhere?
2097000	2098000	You wanna run somewhere?
2100000	2101000	Hey, put your shoes on.
2101000	2102000	Why don't you put your bag down?
2103000	2105000	Tough stuff? Put your bag down, tough stuff?
2107000	2108000	Hit me! Hit me, bitch!
2109000	2110000	Hit me!
2111000	2112000	I'm right here! I'm right here!
2112000	2114000	You coming out of me, so you hit me!
2115000	2116000	You're so about it!
2118000	2119000	You're so about it, you're so make it bad!
2120000	2123000	The fuck? Oh, he's doing shit on camera, Vicky, do something about it!
2123000	2124000	Okay, then do it, then!
2135000	2138000	It was about as anticlimactic as one could expect,
2138000	2141000	and only further served to embarrass the Instagram sensation.
2141000	2145000	Lil Tay, backed by her brother, was also there to get in on the clout fest
2145000	2148000	and try and involve herself in this clash of the titans.
2148000	2150000	This showdown brought plenty of attention,
2150000	2152000	and the commentators were all over it,
2152000	2155000	expressing their excitement at the sheer chaos that was being wrought.
2155000	2158000	However, there was something a bit more technical at play,
2158000	2160000	because now Vicky had turned 18,
2160000	2163000	and whether she wanted to admit it or not, she was a responsible adult,
2163000	2166000	and this was something that she noted in a video about the instance.
2166000	2172000	For all you dumbass kids that keep commenting about me in a bad baby situation,
2172000	2174000	y'all don't even know what really happened.
2174000	2176000	That bitch is scary.
2176000	2181000	That bitch snuck me from behind while I was on the ground trying to grab my purse.
2181000	2183000	Let me tell y'all something.
2183000	2186000	This bitch waited until I was 18 to really fight me.
2186000	2189000	Like, bitch, we had beef for a whole year.
2189000	2192000	I just turned 18, and then you wanna fight me?
2192000	2194000	Bregoli was someone who was not an adult.
2194000	2196000	Now, we know that she hadn't waited tactically.
2196000	2200000	We actually know that at this point, this whole feud was completely fake.
2200000	2204000	But Vicky did have, at this point, an awareness of possible consequences
2204000	2208000	that her behavior might ensue, and this was about to become very serious.
2208000	2210000	At the end of the day, this may be one big act,
2210000	2213000	but you have to make sure the other person isn't on the joke.
2213000	2215000	With the Bregoli fight, it's okay.
2215000	2218000	No one else has to understand it's fake as long as the people feuding do.
2218000	2221000	There's no one with huge stakes in this race.
2221000	2223000	There's no big gang behind you.
2223000	2226000	But what happens when the act goes too far?
2226000	2228000	They hatin', but the money keep dancin'.
2228000	2231000	I ain't doin' shit unless I get a fraction.
2231000	2234000	Bad baby, you is not with the action.
2234000	2237000	You find that savage, bitch, you not with the action.
2237000	2239000	In April slash May, around the same time,
2239000	2244000	Woah Vicky made a video to one of her songs that ended up on World Star Hip Hop.
2244000	2248000	This received a significant amount of attention, obviously a lot of negative attention.
2248000	2251000	One of these people who did not respond well was rapper Snoop Dogg.
2251000	2253000	He was not pleased about the promotion of this,
2253000	2255000	so he expressed his dissatisfaction.
2255000	2259000	I'll see if I can find these clips from the vault, but I'm not too optimistic.
2259000	2262000	This is just people's word, but it seems pretty believable.
2262000	2265000	Anyhow, this provoked a response from Vicky,
2265000	2269000	who clearly felt like she had to assert herself on Snoop Dogg's turf.
2269000	2272000	All I'll say is that it was slightly ill-advised.
2283000	2293000	Yes, this was a video of her threatening real gangster Snoop Dogg.
2293000	2297000	Not a joke, not a meme, just a really, really bad idea.
2297000	2300000	Regardless, Snoop Dogg obviously didn't take it too well,
2300000	2303000	but took it with a level of professionalism that you'd expect
2303000	2308000	from someone having to deal with basically what seemed like a rowdy teenager.
2308000	2310000	I can't believe you said something about me.
2310000	2313000	I'm going to leave it alone though, because you don't know no better.
2313000	2316000	And them goofball ass niggas you got with you, they don't know no better either.
2316000	2319000	That's why I'm in the gym, so I can fuck one of y'all up on sight.
2319000	2321000	No, I'm just playing.
2324000	2326000	Oh my God, what does hip-hop come to?
2326000	2329000	Either way, she quickly backpedaled and apologised.
2329000	2333000	Do I say that we apologise to Snoop Dogg? You know what I'm saying?
2333000	2337000	On behalf of what he said and what I said, you know what I'm saying?
2337000	2340000	Because he really didn't know what he said because somebody told him what he said.
2340000	2343000	Because I was out there doing my own thing, so I ain't hearing him say that.
2343000	2345000	You know what I'm saying? Somebody told him what to say.
2345000	2348000	He really didn't know what that meant. You know what I'm saying?
2348000	2352000	Like, we shouldn't have listened, because at the end of the day, we our own person.
2352000	2356000	We can make our own decisions, but sometimes it just be like that when it be in the moment, you feel me?
2356000	2359000	Like, people be telling us what to do, and we just be listening.
2359000	2363000	By the end of the day, we learned our lesson. We going to stop all that listening to folk.
2363000	2366000	The wise thing to do, all things considered.
2366000	2373000	But it's clear at this point, she was becoming far too invested in the persona, and it was becoming dangerous.
2373000	2380000	Here she was, with other clueless kids, involving herself in something she clearly didn't understand.
2380000	2388000	She may understand that she's not black, but she was still trying to assert herself in a culture that only has idols on the grittiest of terms.
2388000	2394000	Vicky was trying to enter a culture that she didn't understand, and it was time that she took a step back.
2394000	2399000	Vicky is white, but she's more than that. You can be white and have a rough upbringing.
2399000	2401000	You can be from a really nasty area.
2401000	2406000	But Vicky, in spite of her struggles, clearly never had that intimate experience.
2406000	2408000	She was completely out of her depth.
2408000	2410000	Now, I do not hate her for that.
2410000	2416000	She didn't choose the family that she was born into, and if she wants to become more culturally experienced, then who am I to take that away?
2416000	2420000	But it became clear that it was not about the cultural experience that Vicky was engaged in.
2420000	2425000	She was engaged in the grandstanding persona that many actual rappers broadcast to their audience.
2425000	2432000	But the difference is, these rappers only behave that way because they've probably had the experience that has hardened them to having that outlook.
2432000	2436000	With someone like Vicky, it's just a front, it's a persona, she's not gangster.
2436000	2444000	All the cat fights and online ranting showed someone who was gleefully out of touch, and to be honest, if I was Snoop Dogg, I'd be kinda pissed off too.
2444000	2451000	Imagine WorldStarHipHop publishing a video from Woah Vicky and not the numerous artists who probably deserved that platform more,
2451000	2458000	and probably needed it more, because they actually experienced the backgrounds that they claimed to represent, and didn't have a load of money to already flex.
2458000	2464000	Vicky represented the most vapid elements of hip-hop culture, the sort of blind acceptance that someone has money,
2464000	2472000	and the erosion of the visibility of actual experiences that makes the acquisition of income a victorious feeling for those who have actually been impoverished.
2472000	2479000	So yeah, going all big man, threatening someone who has a legitimate problem with what you represent is probably a bad idea,
2479000	2486000	and I think that was probably the wake-up call she needed, because if she wanted to talk the talk, she was gonna be forced to walk the walk eventually.
2486000	2494000	It was also important to note that in spite of the infamy that this had obtained her, this didn't really gain her much attention on the socials other than Instagram,
2494000	2497000	and even then, it didn't seem to be the best sort of publicity.
2498000	2505000	The statement, any publicity is good publicity, may be true if that's the brand you seek, but the problem is, once the bad publicity has died down,
2505000	2510000	you'll either cascade into the pits of oblivion, or go out doing something incredibly stupid.
2510000	2515000	It seems that Vicky had the latter in mind when she made that video threatening Snoop Doggy Dogg here,
2515000	2518000	but by the end of the week, she was seeing a very different tune.
2518000	2527000	I didn't really mean to disrespect nobody in that type of way, I got respect for him, and his people, you know what I'm saying?
2527000	2532000	I realised what I said was wrong, but I would rather apologise to him.
2532000	2537000	Now this could have been the end of Vicky, honestly, I think many of us expected it to be.
2537000	2545000	It's clear that she didn't actually have the guts to push on in that lane, but at the same time, it may have been the worst time to give up too,
2545000	2552000	because not only would she be exiting the game with a terrible reputation, she'd leave the game with a pathetic one.
2552000	2556000	No one inside or outside of this industry was going to take her seriously,
2556000	2561000	so the only other option was to use what she had left of her platform to retain her credibility,
2561000	2566000	and she only had a limited amount of time, a heavy task all things considered,
2566000	2571000	because she had spent nearly a year at this point building her reputation up as anything but that.
2571000	2577000	However, what we were about to witness was perhaps one of the most incredible redemption arcs in history.
2601000	2607000	At the end of the day, Woah Vicky's story is morally dubious, but she did have one ace up her sleeve,
2607000	2612000	that she was intimate with an industry that has acted much worse than her in many capacities,
2612000	2619000	and one of those prime examples was our friend Lil Tay, a child who was caught up unwillingly in a situation they didn't deserve,
2619000	2625000	so whether she intended to or not, blowing the whistle on Lil Tay's reputation was probably the best thing she could do.
2625000	2630000	Now at that point, it had already been established that Lil Tay had other people pulling the strings,
2630000	2632000	as if it was not obvious already.
2632000	2637000	However, having someone perceptibly close and invested in her success as Woah Vicky,
2637000	2641000	for someone who in many regards could benefit from her doing well,
2641000	2646000	to have her actually turn around and say no, something's wrong, was an important statement,
2646000	2648000	and a lot of people recognised that.
2648000	2654000	Let me just start by saying, y'all think this is Lil Tay, this is not Lil Tay, let me tell you.
2654000	2662000	Lil Tay is a little girl, a little ten year old girl, who came from Canada, Vancouver, who plays ballet,
2662000	2666000	you know what I'm saying, she don't know nothing about no rappers, she don't know nothing about flexing,
2666000	2672000	it's her brother that runs her account, it's her brother that tells her what to do, and it's her brother in her ear,
2672000	2676000	you know what I'm saying, she's only ten years old, she's really a good person,
2676000	2680000	it's just her brother in her ear, telling her what to do, he makes her cry,
2680000	2686000	we went to a GQ concert, and she did really good, and afterwards, he started yelling at her,
2686000	2690000	like, why'd you do that, you did it wrong, duh duh duh duh, and then she started crying,
2690000	2693000	because she's ten years old, she doesn't know how to handle all that.
2693000	2696000	Now, I'm not saying that this was a tactical move by any means,
2696000	2701000	as mentioned throughout the video, I don't feel like she's always been the most self-aware person,
2701000	2705000	I do feel that her behaviour was, in part, made possible through the enabling of peers,
2705000	2709000	and the situation may have just resonated with her in that specific moment,
2709000	2714000	maybe she genuinely related, I feel that it could well have been a moment of sobriety from her behalf,
2714000	2719000	it just turned out to be very beneficial, because for once, people valued her words,
2719000	2723000	and I don't think people would have valued her words on any other matter,
2723000	2727000	so it was the best time to start repairing that reputation,
2727000	2731000	Vicky needed to take a step back from such a toxic environment,
2731000	2736000	that sort of stuff, whether put on or real, is not healthy for an individual,
2736000	2740000	and by doing it in a way that held elements of her character,
2740000	2743000	while helping another person who was clearly suffering,
2743000	2747000	she did it in an incredibly honourable, respectful way,
2747000	2751000	this then gave her the credibility to call out various other aspects of her life,
2751000	2754000	and for once, many people actually supported her.
2754000	2757000	I just want to let you know, little Tay, if you are watching this,
2757000	2762000	like, I've talked with you, it's just like your brother, you know what I'm saying?
2762000	2766000	I know you did in the day that's your brother, and you know what I'm saying,
2766000	2770000	y'all close, but you know, despite what he thinks about you,
2770000	2775000	I really do like you, it's just like, you know, he doesn't like me or whatever,
2775000	2780000	so it's just gonna be like that, but this video is only for Jason, her brother,
2781000	2784000	has nothing to do with her, like, she's really a good person,
2784000	2787000	and she's the person who runs her page and stuff, you know,
2787000	2790000	he needs to get caught up for what he does because that's messed up.
2790000	2795000	In a run of videos, she blew the whistle on the sides and the nature of her content.
2795000	2797000	In another one that I've already mentioned,
2797000	2800000	she called out the fakeness of her beef with Danielle Bregoli,
2800000	2804000	revealing DMs that essentially showed that the whole dispute was completely orchestrated,
2804000	2807000	and done with the belief that it would be good publicity for both of them.
2807000	2812000	This run of whistleblowing on her antics allowed her to restore some level of reputation
2812000	2815000	as an actually real person who knew who she was.
2815000	2819000	Basically, like, that's my homegirl, like, we cool in real life,
2819000	2822000	so basically what happened was, she hit me up,
2822000	2826000	she's like, yo, let's do this little publicity stunt,
2826000	2830000	um, you know, it's finna be good for both of us,
2830000	2834000	we finna be all over the shade room, all over Worldstar,
2834000	2836000	like, this shit finna go up.
2836000	2840000	I'm like, okay, okay, we can do that, we can do that,
2840000	2842000	you know, all that extra little beef we done did,
2842000	2847000	it just for the grand, like, we don't really don't like each other,
2847000	2852000	like, because let me tell y'all, whenever people be beefing on social media,
2852000	2854000	other people eat that shit up.
2854000	2856000	In another video, she talks about her own securities events,
2856000	2859000	about how she views social pressure on individuals.
2859000	2861000	Once again, she's not the most articulate,
2861000	2863000	but it's decent advice for those who are lacking self confidence.
2864000	2871000	So that's just what I got to say today about, you know, um, self confidence,
2871000	2876000	and loving yourself, you know, no matter what people say,
2876000	2879000	remember beauty comes within, not on the outside,
2879000	2881000	outside look cool or whatever.
2881000	2885000	For the moment, Vicky's provocative content was great publicity,
2885000	2889000	but it was also a publicity that would either lead to you going down a road
2889000	2892000	with legitimate danger, as demonstrated by those few run-ins,
2892000	2895000	or burning out because you can't top those antics.
2895000	2897000	It's the classic SpongeBob rip my pants gag,
2897000	2901000	once you've escalated it, repeating it will come with diminished returns every time,
2901000	2905000	and going over the edge will just lead to you being shot down.
2905000	2907000	A fresh start was the perfect option,
2907000	2909000	although it seemed impossible for her to obtain that,
2909000	2911000	she did it for those she cared about,
2911000	2915000	in the form of a selfless act that also helped her move away from that behaviour.
2915000	2919000	Of course, not many people see her as that post-clarity person,
2919000	2921000	but I guess she is there now.
2921000	2923000	I'm gonna get on a little topic today,
2923000	2927000	it's gonna be about my relationships,
2927000	2932000	and, you know, my love life and stuff.
2932000	2936000	In another video, she talks about her ex, pappy JJ Lil Rot, you know the drill.
2936000	2939000	On principle, it was a vague video with not too much said,
2939000	2942000	but it was one where I came to a realisation,
2942000	2947000	that this identity that she had built that persona off was a part of her,
2947000	2951000	and it was more than just something that she perceived as trendy,
2951000	2954000	but something that she cared about with people that she cared about,
2954000	2957000	and then the strangest thing happened,
2957000	2959000	I began to feel sympathy for her,
2959000	2963000	which honestly, with everything considered was one of the strangest feelings,
2963000	2966000	but I kind of understand it.
2966000	2969000	I still love him, but it is what it is sometimes.
2969000	2973000	I learned in life, you gotta love people from a distance.
2973000	2977000	Okay, let's say this, my mistake I made with John.
2977000	2981000	If I had kept my expectation out of it, my feelings wouldn't have been hurt.
2981000	2985000	Wouldn't have been hurt, you know,
2985000	2989000	because if you keep your expectations out of it, you can still be cool with them.
2989000	2992000	Me and John are still friends, we cool, it is what it is.
2992000	2997000	We was friends before that, and that's why I feel like the best relationships come from friendships,
2997000	2999000	because, you know what I'm saying,
2999000	3003000	you gotta be able to be around a person, be cool with a person.
3003000	3006000	They can be your homeboy, be your homegirl,
3006000	3009000	and then y'all get in a relationship, then y'all do what you do with your kids,
3009000	3011000	you whoop the whoop.
3011000	3013000	If you have a kid, you are not supposed to tell them,
3013000	3016000	oh, your dad this, your dad that, because being a kid, they don't know no better.
3016000	3019000	They're going to believe you, and they're going to treat their parent like shit.
3019000	3022000	You should never want your kid to hate their parent.
3022000	3024000	At the end of the day, that is their parent.
3024000	3027000	Your beef ain't got nothing to do with that kid, nothing.
3027000	3031000	Don't put your kid in that beef, your kid is young, your kid don't know.
3031000	3033000	You know what I'm saying, that's his dad.
3033000	3036000	No matter what, that's always going to be their dad, they only get one dad, they only get one mom.
3036000	3038000	So why would you want to make them hate them?
3038000	3042000	The video is mature, has a lot of genuinely introspective and well thought out statements,
3042000	3045000	even if not expressed with the greatest articulation,
3045000	3049000	but it showed a maturity, one that I had not observed before,
3049000	3053000	and it demonstrated she had much more awareness than I originally gave her credit for.
3053000	3059000	However, I don't know how long that awareness was there for, as stated in previous parts,
3059000	3062000	her persona was not the smoothest of adaptations.
3062000	3068000	Y'all think I'm just like stupid and slow, but I'm actually very smart in person,
3068000	3074000	and I know I should start showing that side on Instagram, but I didn't realize that until now.
3074000	3079000	In the comment section, there were a load of people implying that actually she'd played us all,
3079000	3085000	a game of 4D chess where she works her way up to the top with trashy antics and then refines her brand.
3085000	3090000	Was that true? Was that the case? Have we all been played?
3090000	3094000	But, you know what I'm saying, I realize now that, you know what I'm saying,
3094000	3098000	you shouldn't do everything for clout because, let me tell y'all, no matter what everybody's saying,
3098000	3101000	not all policies are different because y'all gonna keep that 100 with y'all.
3101000	3105000	So, you know what I'm saying, think before you do some dumb shit on the internet.
3105000	3110000	No, I don't think so. As said, I think it's more likely that she got into a character
3110000	3114000	that she became over-invested in with the wrong type of reinforcement,
3114000	3116000	and eventually she snapped out of it.
3116000	3120000	It would've taken a genius to really work out exactly where the trends were going,
3120000	3124000	and I still don't think any of those escapades were a particularly smart route,
3124000	3126000	and I think she understands that too.
3126000	3130000	No one's gonna convince me that an altercation with a security guard and a police officer
3130000	3132000	was a good idea that somehow embedded her career.
3132000	3136000	No one could've ascertained the presence of Lil Tay, and how that would provide an opportunity
3136000	3140000	for the post-chaos clarity that Vicky demonstrated in that moment,
3140000	3146000	and would open up the numerous opportunities to basically change herself that would come about in the future.
3146000	3150000	It was, of course, a clout game. These things are a clout game.
3150000	3155000	We know she didn't exactly believe it, but she was invested in it for a reason,
3155000	3161000	and I think she eventually came to the realization that not everything is worth the clout that people ascribe to it.
3161000	3166000	And as she puts it so eloquently, not all pussy is good pussy.
3166000	3171000	So what is the good pussy that Victoria is aspiring for nowadays?
3171000	3176000	Oh wait, she said publicity. That was my error. I do apologise, did I?
3176000	3182000	Unfortunately, my biased hearing is now getting the better of me, because you know me, guys, I love the pussy.
3182000	3185000	Anyhow, back to the point, let's go into our final part.
3186000	3191000	I wanna come out here and really live on my own and learn how to be responsible with y'all.
3191000	3193000	I feel like if I live on my own, I'd grow up.
3193000	3197000	You know, I feel like I am growing up at my age, but I really grow up.
3197000	3201000	Like, no cap, like, cause you get to see the real world.
3209000	3214000	In some videos, Vicky speaks about her own issues with fitting in with the world,
3215000	3220000	and although her struggles don't align with those on a racial basis, they're still struggles nonetheless.
3220000	3227000	They were merely struggles at the time, in my opinion, she sought to remedy in a rather outlandish and unfortunately embarrassing way.
3227000	3230000	However, that doesn't undermine the struggles that she may have gone through,
3230000	3235000	and the ways that she may have wanted to have been accepted that were probably even more destructive.
3235000	3239000	It's just that her struggles didn't necessarily align with behavior that she prescribed,
3240000	3246000	behaviors that were aggressively unpleasant, unnecessarily provocative, and delusional if she actually believed them.
3246000	3249000	And although I'd argue that she was aware of her racial shortcomings,
3249000	3255000	I still think there was an element of wishful thinking that led her to try and reach that persona.
3255000	3259000	She's never gonna fully shake the stigma that she's gonna be remembered for,
3259000	3265000	and that's why I don't think it's some galaxy brain calculation she clearly regrets it to.
3265000	3267000	Was it contrived? For sure.
3267000	3272000	But I think it was born out of a desire to find belongings that she had not found in other environments,
3272000	3277000	and when it caught on as a persona, she wanted to use it for the clout and the validation,
3277000	3282000	surrounding herself with people who would support her for it, and maybe for reasons less than wholesome sometimes.
3282000	3285000	It was a huge risk, and it still is, you know?
3285000	3289000	There are things that she said and did that could follow her until the end.
3289000	3295000	However, for what it's worth, even though she's arguably one of the most ludicrous people who I have ever covered,
3295000	3299000	I do think she might deserve some sort of life ahead of her.
3299000	3303000	And it feels weird, after all the insensitive garbage that she indulged in, that I'd say that.
3303000	3310000	But you know, I'm not one to take away the belonging that she clearly genuinely finds within her community,
3310000	3314000	and I do genuinely believe that she feels at home with the people that she surrounds herself with.
3314000	3318000	It's also just a case of knowing the boundaries and respecting them within that community too,
3318000	3321000	something that she lacked for a long time.
3321000	3324000	You step into someone's house and you respect their rules.
3324000	3328000	I think that has to be kept in mind when you're on the internet, when you're online,
3328000	3332000	provoking yourself onto a culture that you may not be wholly familiar with.
3332000	3338000	And arguably, what may have happened is that familiarization with a greater culture eventually,
3338000	3340000	outside of her circle of friends.
3340000	3344000	She may have realized and become more sensitive to the repercussions.
3344000	3348000	What she says amongst her friends is her and her friends' discretion to a large extent.
3348000	3350000	I don't really care about that.
3350000	3355000	However, when you're broadcasting yourself to a large amount of people, the context changes,
3355000	3361000	and when she finally grew up, it probably dawned on her that she would be held to a much more significant standard,
3361000	3366000	and that persona wasn't worth maintaining for the sake of spikes in attention that it provides.
3366000	3370000	So she did change, and it's arguably worked out much better for her,
3370000	3375000	even if it doesn't give her the instant attention that she sometimes craves.
3376000	3381000	Do y'all puss-ass hoes see me right now? Makeup? Done? Hair done? A puss-ass hoe could never, but
3381000	3384000	I just want to make this video to all my females out there, like,
3384000	3387000	don't let these little boys distract you from getting your money.
3387000	3390000	Don't let them stress you out. Don't let them lie to you. You better than that.
3390000	3395000	At the end of the day, just stay focused, get to the money, because at the end of the day, that's the only thing that matter, not them. Period.
3395000	3400000	And don't let these little puss-ass hoes distract you either, because they could never. Remember that.
3400000	3406000	She's still rather aggressive, and likes to flex her income in ways that, frankly, I find rather excessive.
3406000	3411000	I'm still not entirely sure why anyone wants to watch people like that.
3411000	3416000	She still releases music that I do not find the most pleasant to the ears, but hey,
3416000	3419000	to the people wondering, yes, she has changed.
3419000	3422000	She's not really abusing the race card anymore.
3422000	3425000	Generally, the target of her rants have become the puss-ass hoes.
3425000	3429000	A much better aim than people who can't say the n-word like she does.
3429000	3434000	You puss-ass hoes can never take your mama to Jamaica. This is a real hot girl summer.
3434000	3439000	I take my mama on trips. What's your hoes all about taking your mama on trips?
3439000	3441000	Between Jamaica.
3441000	3444000	And you know what? Damn those puss-ass hoes.
3444000	3451000	Woah Vicky is going to other countries, and you are still restricted to your own land borders due to a lack of monetary income.
3451000	3455000	It's not particularly inspired, but it's not exceptionally bad.
3455000	3457000	I've seen much worse.
3457000	3463000	As for her YouTube content, it has become fairly generic stuff, typically the challenges and so on.
3463000	3465000	It's rather harmless, must I add.
3465000	3471000	It's not going to provoke any exceptional attention, but for people who want to follow her work, I can't take that away.
3471000	3476000	I think she'd always be the most successful on Instagram because she's best in small doses.
3476000	3478000	For me, no doses at all.
3478000	3484000	Once you take away the provocation, there's not really too much to her personality in my opinion, but that's how I view it.
3484000	3490000	On some positive notes, it seems like she's reconnecting with her mother, which is nice, and she's also an actual adult,
3490000	3496000	so people following her for her pictures and photos, good job, you're actually following a legal adult for once.
3496000	3504000	A lot of her most controversial videos have been removed by herself, and she seems happy to do that, and I understand why.
3504000	3510000	You can still find those videos, she's not shutting them down necessarily, but you can't have it all your own way,
3510000	3513000	and I think that's something that Woah Vicky understands.
3513000	3520000	The story of Woah Vicky is an interesting arc, because it began long before the character that we were introduced to on the website came to be.
3520000	3527000	A person who clearly became invested in a culture found solace in the idea that they could become one with these people who
3527000	3530000	septed her, and reinforced that behaviour.
3530000	3537000	However, that quickly manifested into conduct, whether contrived or not, that generated a lot of controversy,
3537000	3544000	and grew into this destructive persona that ultimately became more of a detriment with every publicity stunt partaken.
3544000	3551000	I don't know the exact mindset that created this, but I don't think she's just some bourgeois girl trying to cash in on a different culture.
3551000	3558000	She clearly has her privileges, but it's not without the struggles either, she just needed a more productive way to deal with it,
3558000	3565000	and if she's found that now, even if I wish she hadn't gone that route, I'm not gonna turn her away from her destination.
3565000	3568000	I hope people know you love them while they still here.
3568000	3573000	Motherfuckers can be here and be gone the next day, you better show them you love them.
3573000	3581000	You beefing with somebody, you ain't talking to somebody, you got pressure with somebody, you ain't talk to somebody in your family in a long time because they did this to you.
3581000	3584000	But you don't know what they did to me, I don't give a fuck what they did to you.
3584000	3589000	End that shit, squash that shit, call them, pull up on them. It ain't worth it.
3590000	3594000	So that was the video, it was quite the long one, I'll say that much.
3594000	3604000	And I don't know, I just found like I had a lot to say, and things that I was expecting to find out didn't quite turn out the way they seemed to be.
3604000	3606000	And so when I was surprised, that's what happens.
3606000	3612000	I wanna give a big shoutout to the editors, they've done a fantastic job, I cannot thank them enough.
3612000	3618000	I think that they, you know, make such a genuine difference to me.
3618000	3630000	The $10 patreons right now on screen, $50 patreons, I have to give a big thanks to Caroline, Sarah, Lizbeth, Sumhala Baloo, and the Specter Angel, thank you so much.
3630000	3638000	And the $100 patreons, Adam, Michael, Brandon, Jungk, thank you so much, it means a hell of a lot to me.
3638000	3642000	It does not go without notice, it does not go without notice for sure.
3642000	3651000	Also, if you wanna reach me, my Twitter is at TheRightOpinion, Facebook too, Discord, all there, if you wanna find me.
3651000	3653000	And so that's where I'm gonna be.
3653000	3661000	I don't really have too much else to add, I love everyone a lot, I'm pretty tired, but I'm okay, we're hanging in there.
3661000	3670000	It's been a good recording, in spite of its rather long topic, I hope that the video is a good one, and I hope people enjoy it.
3670000	3680000	It's gonna be weird if this is my longest video of all time, but hey, that's the way the cards fall sometimes, the cards do whatever they wanna do.
3680000	3684000	But yeah, I'm TheRightOpinion, and I will see you in the next one.
3700000	3708000	Thanks for watching!
