00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
Hey you guys.

00:02.000 --> 00:06.000
Word on the screen is that there's a girl out there who thinks she's black.

00:06.000 --> 00:08.000
A girl named Woah Vicky.

00:08.000 --> 00:09.000
Woah Vicky.

00:09.000 --> 00:10.000
Woah Vicky.

00:10.000 --> 00:11.000
Woah Vicky.

00:11.000 --> 00:14.000
If I enjoy this shit, I'ma eat this shit like I enjoy it.

00:14.000 --> 00:18.000
A young girl who thinks she's black or a fuck.

00:18.000 --> 00:19.000
You're not black.

00:19.000 --> 00:20.000
Get that through her head.

00:20.000 --> 00:23.000
And I want you to free all my hitters in the chain gang.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
An enigma in many ways.

00:26.000 --> 00:30.000
But, what is behind the persona?

00:31.000 --> 00:35.000
Today, we'll try and find out.

00:39.000 --> 00:44.000
Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time.

00:44.000 --> 00:47.000
And honestly, for today's video, we're gonna do something a little different.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
We're gonna go back to the retrospectives.

00:49.000 --> 00:52.000
I'm not gonna lie, I haven't been feeling great of recent,

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
in the last few months I've been covering recent drama more and more,

00:55.000 --> 00:59.000
because for the first time in a while there has been a lot of current situations going down.

00:59.000 --> 01:03.000
But at the end of the day, that doesn't mean that there aren't some really intriguing stories

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
that many have left behind that I still think are worth talking about.

01:06.000 --> 01:11.000
Not just because they may be interesting, but because they may have left perceptions that are worth challenging.

01:11.000 --> 01:16.000
So today we're going to wade into one of the most unique stories of a cultural manifestation there is,

01:16.000 --> 01:20.000
and talk about someone who at a time of sensitivity caused so much controversy.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
Yet, no one really took seriously.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
That person is Woah Vicky.

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
Woah Vicky, originally branded as Victoria Waldrip,

01:27.000 --> 01:33.000
is the YouTube phenomenon that could only be the product of the post-2016 reality that we appear to live in now.

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
I don't remember where I was when I discovered Woah Vicky,

01:36.000 --> 01:40.000
but it's clear that honestly I was completely fine with not being able to completely remember,

01:40.000 --> 01:43.000
because Victoria here had a persona that was rather hard to forget.

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
In fact, I did cover her in a video a long time ago,

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
back when I was making much shorter videos,

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
however, I don't really think I provided too much nuance

01:51.000 --> 01:56.000
rather than arguing that, shock horror, Woah Vicky is an African American.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
Now, if this is the first time you've heard of this character,

01:58.000 --> 02:02.000
you may wonder why on earth I would have to argue such a presumed thesis.

02:02.000 --> 02:05.000
What would I do next, argue that Arnold Schwarzenegger is Austrian?

02:05.000 --> 02:12.000
Who on earth would argue that such a character is not identical as an ethnicity that they seemingly appeared to not represent?

02:13.000 --> 02:20.000
Yes, my birthday is March 7th, but July 19th was the day I found out I was black.

02:20.000 --> 02:25.000
Ah yes, Vicky herself. That was what of course made her rather infamous.

02:25.000 --> 02:29.000
You see, in the summer of 17, when we should have all been enjoying the sunny weather,

02:29.000 --> 02:34.000
storm clowns began to form, this presence on Twitter, and Instagram, and YouTube,

02:34.000 --> 02:38.000
this character, who openly used sensitive words rather liberally,

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
and justified it under the notion of her racial identity,

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
and then presumed to take this further, and further, and further.

02:44.000 --> 02:49.000
Through this provocative behaviour, she quickly gathered a following from a variety of individuals.

02:49.000 --> 02:54.000
I assume some people genuinely liked her, but many were also there to just dish out heavy criticism,

02:54.000 --> 02:59.000
and to clown on her whenever she decided to provide her less than nuanced input on matters of race.

02:59.000 --> 03:04.000
Through this, she quickly gained infamy, with much of this attention, whether positive or negative,

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
snowballing into publicity.

03:05.000 --> 03:10.000
After all, white girl thinks she's black is arguably some of the best YouTube clickbait,

03:10.000 --> 03:14.000
and also it's an easy topic that people love to jump in on, because although socially loaded,

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
no one's gonna really call you out for making fun of her.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
But why the hunger? Why the desire?

03:19.000 --> 03:24.000
Because although the appeal could be observed, what made people suddenly want to turn to her?

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
I've spoken about this before in my rather old Lil Tay video,

03:27.000 --> 03:31.000
but there is this show called Dr. Phil, it's basically aimed to be a more therapeutic,

03:31.000 --> 03:36.000
professional version of shows such as Jerry Springer, the pyrocynical to your leafy per se.

03:36.000 --> 03:41.000
On Dr. Phil, he often invites a multitude of guests on who are undergoing conflict within their lives,

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
whether that be between their friends, family, or themselves.

03:44.000 --> 03:49.000
It will often escalate with dispute, with Phil attempting to take a more mediating position,

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
and attempting to provide some form of counseling.

03:51.000 --> 03:55.000
This has had its fair share of criticism in the past, and maybe I'll dissect that one day,

03:55.000 --> 04:00.000
but for now, there is one episode that I think is quite important to focus our attention on,

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
and it is of course the episode that includes Danielle Bregoli.

04:03.000 --> 04:11.000
First uploaded to YouTube in August 2016, it gradually gained traction and coverage over the following months.

04:11.000 --> 04:16.000
Whenever watching it, you feel a strange sadness knowing that this was what our society had come to.

04:16.000 --> 04:20.000
However, this sadness didn't really sink in for me personally until a few months later,

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
when her tweets started to seep onto my timeline.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
The ones where she was flexing about how much money she was making,

04:26.000 --> 04:31.000
a girl famous for being aggressive, unpleasant, toxic, and all around culturally clueless,

04:31.000 --> 04:37.000
and there I was, a sad student in university, doing his best not to lose his sanity with absolutely nothing.

04:37.000 --> 04:41.000
Turns out all I had to do was become as trashy and clueless as her.

04:41.000 --> 04:45.000
So I started up my Twitch channel, The Twerking Opinion, where I shook my ass for that sweet, sweet dollar.

04:45.000 --> 04:51.000
It did well, but it died shortly after, and I terminated it, because you don't really want people finding that stuff.

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
I jest, I jest, or do I?

04:55.000 --> 05:01.000
Anyhow, although trashiness was nothing new, it became clear that there was a relatively new craving for it,

05:01.000 --> 05:07.000
particularly in the idea of clickbait reaction content that just took any crazy people doing crazy weird things,

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
particularly girls, you perverts.

05:09.000 --> 05:16.000
I'm not sure exactly what phase we were in, but whatever it was, it created young internet sensations in probably the worst way possible.

05:16.000 --> 05:20.000
Woah Vicky was definitely a continuation in this story,

05:20.000 --> 05:25.000
but I've always viewed this trend as a train of sorts, that many people just got on and got off,

05:25.000 --> 05:29.000
whether it was convenient for them, or whether they were genuinely caught up in their own antics,

05:29.000 --> 05:33.000
often being accelerated by commentators and audiences alike.

05:33.000 --> 05:39.000
Woah Vicky definitely embodies one of these people, but no one really stopped to ask exactly what was happening,

05:39.000 --> 05:48.000
why it was happening, and why it was Woah Vicky who decided to take on the burden of being this punching bag.

05:48.000 --> 05:53.000
If Vicky isn't the African American person she always wanted to present herself as, who was she?

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
Who is she? What were her motivations?

05:56.000 --> 06:00.000
The simple clout story is always one that satisfies our judgemental nature,

06:00.000 --> 06:03.000
but it has to be a bit deeper than that, because let's face it,

06:03.000 --> 06:08.000
I assume most people watching this video wouldn't have stooped to that level for the sake of views.

06:08.000 --> 06:11.000
So I think it's time for some theory, and you know what?

06:11.000 --> 06:15.000
After having a bit of research, I think I might just have a story for you today.

06:15.000 --> 06:20.000
So the plan will be to definitively explain the nature of Vicky's persona, starting at her channel's origins,

06:20.000 --> 06:24.000
although it's clear that a fair proportion of her persona is rather contrived,

06:24.000 --> 06:29.000
I want to see if we can be more specific about how much is fabricated and why it would be fabricated,

06:29.000 --> 06:35.000
what we can really say about the story behind this character, and how she has moved forward to the present day.

06:35.000 --> 06:39.000
This would be pointless if it was just an exaggerated persona, but I don't feel that's the case,

06:39.000 --> 06:44.000
and given how offensive she was, I understand why some people may feel strangely towards her,

06:44.000 --> 06:49.000
but I don't know, she never rattled me as much as I might have expected her to,

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
and I think that feeling comes from somewhere.

06:51.000 --> 06:55.000
So today I want to dive into that feeling and see what else we can find,

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
providing you are ready of course, which I assume you are,

06:58.000 --> 07:03.000
though maybe you've left the video on and you've gone off to have a shower and you just like the sound of my voice in the background,

07:03.000 --> 07:06.000
which is fine too, I don't have any problems there either.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
Let us enter the realm of Woah Vicky.

07:10.000 --> 07:28.000
I'm sure you've heard Woah Vicky referred to as her full name a few times, Victoria Wardrip.

07:28.000 --> 07:33.000
Now this may be done for the sake of formality, and maybe just to emphasise how white she actually is,

07:33.000 --> 07:38.000
however it's important to note that when she began her channel, that's how she branded herself.

07:38.000 --> 07:43.000
Oh yes, the amateur vlog filters were in fashion for this classic Victoria Wardrip vlog.

07:43.000 --> 07:47.000
Now funnily enough, from that period, a lot of her videos have been removed from her main channel,

07:47.000 --> 07:52.000
however this one is one that actually Vicky feels can still represent her to this day.

07:52.000 --> 07:57.000
The video exhibits one quite iconic element that would become prominent in her future content, her accent,

07:57.000 --> 08:03.000
however it doesn't actually show an awareness of how daft many of us considered it sounding at the time.

08:03.000 --> 08:08.000
We're about to get on the train.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
Yeah, the train.

08:10.000 --> 08:14.000
Yeah, and we just went through the baggage claim and all that.

08:14.000 --> 08:20.000
In fact, this video is a very casual vlog of her going on holiday with her friends to the Dominican Republic.

08:20.000 --> 08:27.000
Nothing is really particularly out of the ordinary, in fact, the sort of tone conveyed is a girl enjoying herself on holiday with her friends.

08:27.000 --> 08:32.000
It's almost as if the accent is only noticeable to those who are actually watching the YouTube video,

08:32.000 --> 08:35.000
as everyone else seems completely unfazed.

08:35.000 --> 08:40.000
However, as many of you I'm sure are aware, Vicky's presence on the platform precedes her own YouTube channel.

08:40.000 --> 08:45.000
Before the press attention, she had another appearance on a channel with someone known as Virgin JJ,

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
Lil JJ, whatever he's going by now.

08:48.000 --> 08:52.000
Apparently now he's going by the name of Lil Rot, her then boyfriend.

08:52.000 --> 08:56.000
In this video, they answer various questions regarding their relationship.

08:56.000 --> 09:02.000
Nothing particular of interest comes up, just them flexing about how much they are in love for a bit and how much money they have.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
There is, however, this one very interesting comment.

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
Why do you only like white girls?

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
Why do I only like white girls?

09:11.000 --> 09:14.000
I'm not white, I'm mixed.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
Yeah, she's Spanish and white.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
English and Spanish, eh?

09:17.000 --> 09:21.000
Although the assertion that she isn't white was also stated within the video,

09:21.000 --> 09:27.000
I assume that it may have dawned on them that being Spanish is actually a nationality, not actually a race.

09:27.000 --> 09:31.000
On top of this, most Spanish individuals would consider themselves Caucasian.

09:31.000 --> 09:36.000
That is, of course, with reference that the definition of Spanish is hailing from the country of Spain,

09:36.000 --> 09:39.000
and not to be confused with those who may consider themselves Hispanic,

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
although there is a racial discussion regarding that too.

09:41.000 --> 09:49.000
What this also provides interest to was the fact that she divulged that this racial revelation comes from the fact that her father is, in fact, mixed race.

09:49.000 --> 09:53.000
How do your parents feel about you dating a black man?

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
Satisfied?

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
Yeah.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
Satisfied?

09:56.000 --> 10:01.000
Um, my dad's not white, so he don't care.

10:01.000 --> 10:05.000
This is a narrative that she came back to reference on multiple occasions.

10:05.000 --> 10:09.000
Now, her father is a bloke by the name of Steve Waldrop, his parents were Marvin and Louise.

10:09.000 --> 10:13.000
They were also both born in Georgia to seemingly white backgrounds.

10:13.000 --> 10:17.000
Although, of course, it is unclear what the heritage of such family members would be.

10:17.000 --> 10:22.000
That is, information that obviously only the family would and really should have the access to.

10:22.000 --> 10:28.000
However, when you're the only person who is privy to that information, it means that you can perceptibly own the narrative,

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
as implausible as it might seem.

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
In months following this, a new narrative was concocted,

10:33.000 --> 10:40.000
that basically she had done some historical research of her own and found out that she was, in fact, 25% black.

10:40.000 --> 10:45.000
This then gave her access to the copious amounts of privileges that came with being an African American citizen,

10:45.000 --> 10:48.000
such as the glorious N-word pass.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
Who is giving this girl a career?

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
She was very proud of that one.

10:58.000 --> 11:03.000
It also gave her complete access to indulge in all the memes about African American culture,

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
which was certainly unique.

11:05.000 --> 11:10.000
And last, I'mma teach y'all how to swim, like a real n***a.

11:11.000 --> 11:14.000
Of course, she still retains her regular appearance and legal name,

11:14.000 --> 11:20.000
so she seems exempt from any of the negative racial profiling that may actually come with appearing African American,

11:20.000 --> 11:26.000
but hey, who cares about that when you can make that epic meme about African American life?

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
People swimming, am I right?

11:28.000 --> 11:34.000
When challenged on this, she posted further screenshots that allegedly showed that she was, in fact, 44% black,

11:34.000 --> 11:38.000
and therefore even more African American than we initially thought,

11:38.000 --> 11:41.000
if we ignore the small print that reads thousands of years ago, of course,

11:41.000 --> 11:47.000
and in fact, now Vicky has constructed a watertight case on how she is actually African American

11:47.000 --> 11:50.000
and has clear membership to this exclusive club.

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000
Now, I wanted to take a brief aside to clear up some information here,

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
although most of this story is rather clear.

11:56.000 --> 12:00.000
We know that Vicky is an African American, I want to assert that.

12:00.000 --> 12:07.000
But for all I know, Victoria Waldrop may have deep heritage from the plains of Africa if you go back far enough,

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
I mean, a lot of people do.

12:09.000 --> 12:13.000
But one of the greatest myths that even some prolific individuals have fallen foul to today

12:13.000 --> 12:16.000
is the idea that you can prove race with a genetics test.

12:16.000 --> 12:20.000
You can't, you can prove a lot, and you may even find people in your family tree

12:20.000 --> 12:25.000
who would have been identified as a different race at that time, and then try and derive that.

12:25.000 --> 12:30.000
But the race that you are perceived of is strictly within the context of society,

12:30.000 --> 12:34.000
and no genetic test can change that unless society then asserts that,

12:34.000 --> 12:38.000
which would then have to be asserted consistently across the whole society,

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
which is just completely impractical.

12:40.000 --> 12:44.000
Vicky also stated that she will be the one who decides what race she belongs to,

12:44.000 --> 12:47.000
and if she says she's black, then she is black, which once again,

12:47.000 --> 12:51.000
there is inconsistency within society of how people understand race,

12:51.000 --> 12:55.000
but generally there is a declaring that if you're appearing a certain identity,

12:55.000 --> 12:58.000
then you don't really have the liberty to claim you're anything else,

12:58.000 --> 13:02.000
particularly in societies that may have serious baggage with those identities.

13:02.000 --> 13:07.000
There are exceptions to that, a good example would be the late politician Augustus Hawkins,

13:07.000 --> 13:12.000
who was fair-skinned, but came from a highly familial, predominant African-American background,

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
and thus identified as that.

13:14.000 --> 13:17.000
But that's a nuance that I'm sure many people can understand,

13:17.000 --> 13:20.000
and one that Vicky definitely didn't have access to.

13:20.000 --> 13:23.000
However, this was an attitude that did not just arise from nowhere,

13:23.000 --> 13:27.000
with all due respect, it's clear that Vicky was not the sharpest knife in the draw,

13:27.000 --> 13:30.000
I doubt she would be applying for Mensa anytime soon,

13:30.000 --> 13:33.000
and although she deserves some accountability for her antics,

13:33.000 --> 13:37.000
I always felt it must run a bit deeper than just her.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
I'm one of these white folks, okay?

13:51.000 --> 13:55.000
The strangest realisation that I have come to accept in my study was that,

13:55.000 --> 14:02.000
whether exaggerated or not, it is quite likely that that is Vicky's real voice,

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
or at least Vicky believes it is.

14:04.000 --> 14:08.000
There's this expectation that one day Vicky's gonna open her mouth and talk normally,

14:08.000 --> 14:12.000
and we'll just hear this high school basic white girl accent blurt out,

14:12.000 --> 14:15.000
but I actually highly doubt at this point.

14:15.000 --> 14:19.000
Accents are not genetic, they are definitely influenced by the society around us,

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
depending on how easily influenced we are,

14:21.000 --> 14:26.000
and Vicky gives me the sort of idea of someone who may be a bit impressionable here and there.

14:26.000 --> 14:29.000
There is a lot of talk about Vicky's past on the run up to YouTube,

14:29.000 --> 14:32.000
and it seems that it has been turbulent for many reasons.

14:32.000 --> 14:36.000
There was a 30 minute interview conducted by the man himself, Michael McCrudden,

14:36.000 --> 14:39.000
with Woah Vicky, but unfortunately that has been lost to the vaults,

14:39.000 --> 14:42.000
and doesn't appear as if it will be recovered.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
However, we are aware that she is a school dropout,

14:44.000 --> 14:48.000
and didn't have the best time at school or after school.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
I used to be really bad, I used to always sneak out,

14:50.000 --> 14:53.000
I used to be with the wrong crowd,

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
I used to cop for stealing a few times,

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
I was fighting all the time,

14:57.000 --> 15:00.000
I used to sneak boys in the house,

15:00.000 --> 15:04.000
yeah, I was like, this was when I was like 13, 14,

15:04.000 --> 15:05.000
but this school ain't no little better.

15:05.000 --> 15:11.000
She was also raised in a rather broken household with her mother before being transferred to her father.

15:11.000 --> 15:14.000
So how I grew up was, okay so,

15:14.000 --> 15:17.000
I lived with my mom until I was seven, right?

15:17.000 --> 15:21.000
I thought this other guy was my dad that she was with, well not even with,

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
that had kind of raised me,

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
and I grew up with them so I was like six or seven,

15:25.000 --> 15:30.000
and then what had happened was my mom, she was like a little alcoholic or whatever,

15:30.000 --> 15:34.000
so then I had to go live with my dad,

15:34.000 --> 15:37.000
once I would have went to the D, what's it called?

15:37.000 --> 15:40.000
The foster home?

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
Defects? They're called defects, whatever.

15:42.000 --> 15:46.000
They're like, oh, you're not capable of living with this lady and this guy is not your dad,

15:46.000 --> 15:50.000
so you want her to go here, and then they're like, wait, she has a dad, whoop-de-whoop.

15:50.000 --> 15:53.000
And this is all interesting information that I want to keep in mind.

15:53.000 --> 15:58.000
Another interesting clip I want to show is a rant around mid-2017

15:58.000 --> 16:04.000
by her then ex-boyfriend who made claims about her social life and her, quote, real behaviour.

16:04.000 --> 16:07.000
She used to walk out 4am in the morning, bro.

16:07.000 --> 16:11.000
4am in the morning, come back at 7, like, bro, who do that, bro?

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
I don't know what she be on, nigga,

16:14.000 --> 16:19.000
but to me, that sounds like some demonic possession type, you feel me?

16:19.000 --> 16:22.000
And then on top of that, bro, she claims she from Zone 6, bro.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
You are not from Zone 6, my nigga.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
You are not. You from Buckhead, nigga.

16:26.000 --> 16:29.000
That's one of the richest parts in Atlanta, but get out of here, bro.

16:29.000 --> 16:32.000
You from Buckhead? How you gonna say you from Zone 6?

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
Bro, get out of here, bro. That's lame as freak.

16:34.000 --> 16:39.000
So, bro, she thinks she's black, bro.

16:39.000 --> 16:42.000
She thinks he's black, bro.

16:43.000 --> 16:46.000
You're not black. Stop trying to be black, bro.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
Stop. This foolish, bro.

16:48.000 --> 16:51.000
Stop trying to be black. You're not black.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
You are not black, bro.

16:53.000 --> 16:56.000
I got video. I got footage of everything.

16:56.000 --> 16:59.000
Yo, mom, bro, I can expose so much videos of you, Vicky, bro.

16:59.000 --> 17:02.000
You're not black. Stop trying to be black, bro.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
Bro, I even asked her this one time, bro.

17:04.000 --> 17:07.000
I was like, can you talk? What? Can you talk proper?

17:07.000 --> 17:10.000
Can you talk? Please talk proper for one time, bro.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
All I asked was once, and guess what she said?

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
What that mean?

17:14.000 --> 17:17.000
Like, come on, bro. You know how to talk proper, bro.

17:17.000 --> 17:21.000
You was a gothic. You got picked on in middle school, bro.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
You was a goth, my nigga.

17:23.000 --> 17:26.000
Like, bro, come on, bro. You know you can talk.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
You know you can talk proper, bro.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
You know you can talk proper English, bro.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
You know you can, bro. You know it in your heart.

17:32.000 --> 17:35.000
Like, stop. You trying to be somebody else? You not, bro.

17:35.000 --> 17:39.000
Now, I'm not playing this clip as proof or with the idea that I actually believe him here.

17:39.000 --> 17:43.000
I am playing it for a few reasons, some that I want to go into detail now,

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
and some that I will save for later.

17:45.000 --> 17:49.000
July 2017 is when all this began to kick off, particularly on Instagram,

17:49.000 --> 17:52.000
which was when she was noticed by the likes of Danielle Bregoli,

17:52.000 --> 17:55.000
and then became involved in very strange, bizarre disputes,

17:55.000 --> 17:59.000
provoking threats of fights and the rest, in laughably unaware fashion.

18:00.000 --> 18:06.000
Bad hair, baby. Bad bitch. Your city's fake as fuck, bitch.

18:06.000 --> 18:09.000
Now, though clearly a rather exceptional situation,

18:09.000 --> 18:14.000
Bregoli's trashy girl antics always made sense as an outcome of the environment

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
that she clearly hadn't responded well to.

18:16.000 --> 18:21.000
Although clearly tormented as an individual, and with probably a genuinely sad story in how it came to be,

18:21.000 --> 18:24.000
she also had a natural antagonistic attitude.

18:24.000 --> 18:27.000
This never seemed to be the complete case for Vicky,

18:27.000 --> 18:30.000
outside obviously proclaiming that she was African American,

18:30.000 --> 18:35.000
she came across as rather clumsy, and not really fitting the persona that she appeared to have chosen.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
Now, in this situation, there are two main causes for this,

18:37.000 --> 18:40.000
either a person is completely putting it on for the sake of clout,

18:40.000 --> 18:43.000
or that they genuinely believe that this is who they're meant to be,

18:43.000 --> 18:47.000
but they're just completely lost as to how they're meant to portray themselves,

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
and end up looking a bit silly.

18:49.000 --> 18:53.000
With all this in mind, it's very easy to say that someone claiming they're black is clearly faking it,

18:53.000 --> 18:56.000
and in many ways, I do believe that she doesn't believe that.

18:56.000 --> 18:59.000
However, one of the things that I always noticed about Woah Vicky

18:59.000 --> 19:03.000
is that she was often seen socialising with many people from a variety of backgrounds,

19:03.000 --> 19:08.000
and it reminded me of a personal experience many years ago, one involving yours truly.

19:08.000 --> 19:11.000
Back when I was around 12, I didn't have too many friends,

19:11.000 --> 19:16.000
in fact, I was at a stage between schools, and at my previous school I regularly had social issues,

19:16.000 --> 19:19.000
so I doubted I was going to stay in contact with anyone there.

19:19.000 --> 19:22.000
However, there was a summer camp that I used to come by at the school,

19:22.000 --> 19:26.000
this was a camp that at this point primarily hailed from Turkey,

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
and given that I regularly went to the school with my dad,

19:28.000 --> 19:31.000
as it also doubled as a sports facility in the holidays,

19:31.000 --> 19:34.000
I became involved with many of these Turkish students.

19:34.000 --> 19:38.000
One of the things that I remember doing was putting on an Eurasian accent

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
to feel more integrated and accepted,

19:40.000 --> 19:44.000
as someone who had been ostracised fairly regularly for being different at a time,

19:44.000 --> 19:47.000
I guess my mind told me to minimise that difference,

19:47.000 --> 19:53.000
in hindsight it was a fairly daft idea, but it was what I did to be accepted in that moment.

19:53.000 --> 19:59.000
Obviously the Turkish camp left, and at the end of the day they were very culturally different to who I was,

19:59.000 --> 20:02.000
but what if they'd stayed, what if I'd gone back to Turkey with them?

20:02.000 --> 20:03.000
How would I have grown up?

20:03.000 --> 20:06.000
If the stories about social difficulties were correct,

20:06.000 --> 20:09.000
then it's probable that she probably just wanted a way to fit in with people,

20:09.000 --> 20:13.000
however sometimes when you're desperate you'll find any way to fit in,

20:13.000 --> 20:16.000
and that may come with its own risks and changes.

20:16.000 --> 20:21.000
It seems that she found solace with a certain culture that she associated with African Americans,

20:21.000 --> 20:24.000
maybe through the people who were friends with her,

20:24.000 --> 20:27.000
maybe through her relationship with little extra virgin oil,

20:27.000 --> 20:30.000
however at the same time, because she wasn't African American herself,

20:30.000 --> 20:35.000
she wanted to strive for inclusion on the basis of a status that she knew she couldn't obtain,

20:35.000 --> 20:39.000
but wanted to obtain nonetheless, and maybe for them it felt better to validate her,

20:39.000 --> 20:42.000
and hey, if you're friends with her, there were palatial benefits too,

20:42.000 --> 20:46.000
as it's known Vicky was living in a rather excessively wealthy family,

20:46.000 --> 20:49.000
her father's side of the family had been involved in the real estate business,

20:49.000 --> 20:53.000
the most quintessentially American job alongside owning a car dealership,

20:53.000 --> 20:59.000
and that would obviously be attractive for those who may be interested in developing a friendship or relationship with her.

20:59.000 --> 21:02.000
Now I have no comment for any specific individuals involved,

21:02.000 --> 21:05.000
I have no doubt that many people were genuinely friends with her for who she was,

21:05.000 --> 21:10.000
but given the behaviour of some, it became clear that eventually this sort of codependent relationship was developed,

21:11.000 --> 21:16.000
particularly on social media, one where Vicky wanted to spend time around people who gave her credibility,

21:16.000 --> 21:20.000
and many sought to be friends with her because of that growing social media presence.

21:20.000 --> 21:25.000
Her then ex-boyfriend who had released that video completely trashing her demeanour as fake and put on,

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
would soon be back together with Victoria,

21:27.000 --> 21:32.000
and defending her behaviour in some of the honestly most humiliating clips I've seen.

21:32.000 --> 21:36.000
The majority of black people cannot swim because their skin is black,

21:36.000 --> 21:39.000
and I think it's a racial trait.

21:39.000 --> 21:45.000
People say she's not black, but like at the end of the day she took an ancestry test and her results came in,

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
like, results don't lie.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
This environment that had began to surround Woah Vicky,

21:49.000 --> 21:52.000
had basically started this weird chain reaction,

21:52.000 --> 21:56.000
where acceptance on the inside turned to publication on the outside,

21:56.000 --> 21:59.000
maybe in her inner circles people were happy to go along with it,

21:59.000 --> 22:02.000
whatever she wanted to say, and that validated her enough.

22:02.000 --> 22:05.000
Many people seemed to defend her in her friend group,

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
whether they were going along with the act or not.

22:07.000 --> 22:10.000
However, as soon as she moved outside of that friend group,

22:10.000 --> 22:14.000
she was met with hostility from parties who had no stake in supporting her assertions.

22:14.000 --> 22:19.000
She was almost stood in the eye of a hurricane of criticism with her friends around her.

22:19.000 --> 22:22.000
This led to her going further, and further, and further,

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
and maybe her parents should have stepped in too,

22:24.000 --> 22:28.000
but they were probably just happy that she'd found the limelight in the validation

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
that she had maybe been denied in the past.

22:30.000 --> 22:34.000
As noted in another one of her videos, it was better than her previous options,

22:34.000 --> 22:38.000
but the best of a bad bunch doesn't necessarily mean good,

22:38.000 --> 22:41.000
and it was about to devolve pretty badly.

22:41.000 --> 23:01.000
Now I must add that I'm not saying Vicky was completely unaware that she was not black,

23:01.000 --> 23:06.000
she clearly knew, and she clearly knowingly lied about details such as being quote from the six.

23:06.000 --> 23:09.000
I think those details were mainly for the sake of provocation,

23:09.000 --> 23:12.000
but they worked, people were provoked, and at the same time,

23:12.000 --> 23:16.000
facing down that level of hostility, you need some people to support you,

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
you need some people to enable you,

23:18.000 --> 23:22.000
and people around her clearly encouraged her to indulge in that persona,

23:22.000 --> 23:25.000
to make these rather embarrassing videos that have now been deleted.

23:25.000 --> 23:26.000
No surprise there.

23:26.000 --> 23:29.000
This is the lingo.

23:29.000 --> 23:34.000
See you later, Day Day, see y'all niggas at the cookout.

23:34.000 --> 23:38.000
This is what happens when everyone on the inside is telling you that you're doing the right thing

23:38.000 --> 23:41.000
and everyone on the outside is telling you you're doing the wrong thing.

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
I've dealt with this concept before.

23:43.000 --> 23:49.000
For some people, it might be easy to tell that these outside voices are just as valid as those on the inside.

23:49.000 --> 23:53.000
However, at the same time, we are always much more ready to value advice from friends,

23:53.000 --> 23:56.000
particularly if we feel there's a stake in keeping those friends.

23:56.000 --> 24:00.000
There are many valid reasons for this, they understand the circumstances and context

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
that might serve better advice in the long term,

24:02.000 --> 24:07.000
and therefore, as a commentator on these matters, when I provide my own personal thoughts,

24:07.000 --> 24:12.000
I accept that I often do it from a level of distance that means that there may be context that I'm not aware of,

24:12.000 --> 24:16.000
but at the same time, that doesn't necessarily mean I shouldn't provide my thoughts,

24:16.000 --> 24:20.000
or my advice is invalid, because it might just be what they need to realise

24:20.000 --> 24:24.000
that actually the advice that they're receiving from those close to them isn't actually the best,

24:24.000 --> 24:27.000
and is going to hurt them more in the long term.

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
When you're on the roller coaster alongside Woah Vicky,

24:29.000 --> 24:32.000
it might feel good to tell her to keep that ride going,

24:32.000 --> 24:35.000
to keep behaving provocatively, to continue that madness.

24:35.000 --> 24:39.000
Fantastic idea, it's great attention, you'll receive plenty of coverage,

24:39.000 --> 24:42.000
probably a fair bit of money here and there, you can probably sell merch,

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
maybe have your own app, easy dollar,

24:44.000 --> 24:49.000
but ultimately, when you have no one to stop you, you'll have a rude awakening when you go too far,

24:49.000 --> 24:52.000
and that's exactly what happened with Victoria here,

24:52.000 --> 24:55.000
though admittedly, it was a slow, gradual process,

24:55.000 --> 24:58.000
but it still started in 2017.

24:58.000 --> 25:02.000
I must emphasise that, we are still in that timeline.

25:02.000 --> 25:06.000
Now, the publicity of her rather daft statements were finally beginning to come back to her,

25:06.000 --> 25:09.000
the memes were being made out of her claiming she was black,

25:09.000 --> 25:13.000
and it made it back to commentators, people began to make videos on her antics,

25:13.000 --> 25:16.000
including me, though, as always, I was rather late,

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
and threw it in with another person, Martina Bigg,

25:18.000 --> 25:21.000
who in hindsight was a very different case to that of Victoria,

25:21.000 --> 25:25.000
but anyway, the largest creator who became involved in this was RiceGum.

25:26.000 --> 25:30.000
RiceGum, who whomever fucks, he is like,

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
bruh, you coming for me?

25:32.000 --> 25:35.000
But you can't offend me, bruh, because you ain't black, bruh.

25:35.000 --> 25:40.000
Now, at this point, we were still in the I'm black phase of Woah Vicky's character,

25:40.000 --> 25:43.000
it should be very clear that this was a bit of a plea for attention,

25:43.000 --> 25:46.000
this is exactly the same thing that she said to Danielle Bregoli,

25:46.000 --> 25:50.000
you can't say this word, but I can, because I'm actually black.

25:50.000 --> 25:53.000
She knows it provokes, and people view it as ridiculous,

25:53.000 --> 25:56.000
but you know, if it makes a good video, why not give it a try?

25:56.000 --> 25:59.000
RiceGum reacts to it with all the conviction of a failed lawsuit,

25:59.000 --> 26:03.000
and provides more attention to someone who frankly did not really deserve it.

26:03.000 --> 26:07.000
However hell-bent on maximising the attention out of this confrontation,

26:07.000 --> 26:10.000
Vicky decided to take direct aim at RiceGum.

26:10.000 --> 26:13.000
What was she gonna say about him? How was she gonna diss him?

26:13.000 --> 26:16.000
What sort of dynamic content would she come up with?

26:23.000 --> 26:26.000
Ching chong, ching chong, ching chong, bitch.

26:29.000 --> 26:33.000
Ah yes, ching chong, ching chong, ching chong, bitch.

26:33.000 --> 26:38.000
RiceGum must be really quaking in his boots, and you know, it was rather pathetic.

26:38.000 --> 26:41.000
Although it might have been a nice little stunt for attention,

26:41.000 --> 26:44.000
YouTube didn't appreciate it as much, and removed it fairly promptly,

26:44.000 --> 26:48.000
likely due to the mass reports by RiceGum viewers above them actually caring.

26:48.000 --> 26:52.000
She then later responded by posting a statement to the Asian community saying,

26:52.000 --> 26:57.000
please don't take offence as it was only specifically directed towards RiceGum, and not anyone else.

26:57.000 --> 27:00.000
There was also another statement that she made on her Instagram saying

27:00.000 --> 27:04.000
that in fact she found Asian guys very attractive and that they should DM her.

27:04.000 --> 27:07.000
The whole music video was profoundly embarrassing,

27:07.000 --> 27:10.000
but what was hilarious was the number of people surrounding her

27:10.000 --> 27:13.000
who must have thought in their head that this was a good idea.

27:13.000 --> 27:19.000
Aside from the song being terrible, this made it through filming, production, editing, and subsequent upload,

27:19.000 --> 27:23.000
with no one really stepping in and saying, this is terrible, this is awful.

27:23.000 --> 27:27.000
It made it through with the endorsement of basically everyone, I assume.

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
All for a drop of clout.

27:29.000 --> 27:35.000
And it wasn't necessarily anything new, after all she's been going around claiming that she's a completely different race.

27:35.000 --> 27:39.000
However, it was the descent to a new low, the beginning of a slippery slope

27:39.000 --> 27:45.000
that would demonstrate if no one was going to stop her, then she wasn't really prepared to stop herself.

27:45.000 --> 27:48.000
That's what happens when we become over-invested in a persona.

27:48.000 --> 27:54.000
We lose grip on our own reality and the perceptions people have outside our own echo chambers,

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
and how people in the real world actually react.

28:16.000 --> 28:19.000
This didn't mean that she didn't try and flesh out her character.

28:19.000 --> 28:24.000
As mentioned earlier, she had an ongoing dispute or beef with Danielle Bregoli,

28:24.000 --> 28:27.000
and Danielle Bregoli is someone equally loathed amongst the community,

28:27.000 --> 28:31.000
but the beef at least had a second dimension to their characters.

28:31.000 --> 28:36.000
Woah Vicky was probably aware that Race Provocation was a brand that was going to become pretty stale quickly,

28:36.000 --> 28:41.000
so needed to switch it up, and to be honest, Bregoli was probably in that mindset of feuds being good too.

28:41.000 --> 28:44.000
So this beef served as reinforcement for that relevance.

28:44.000 --> 28:51.000
Over the winter months of 2017 going into 2018, she grasped onto her reputation through reaction videos,

28:51.000 --> 28:54.000
regular provocation, and actual interviews.

28:54.000 --> 29:02.000
Yeah, I feel like college is like a scam, and like they just try to get money.

29:02.000 --> 29:09.000
Well like, yeah it's a scam because college teaches you how to work for people,

29:09.000 --> 29:13.000
and most people that's successful, you don't need college, you feel me?

29:14.000 --> 29:19.000
Honestly, I might be inclined to agree to an extent, I have my own criticisms of college,

29:19.000 --> 29:24.000
although I would add that Woah Vicky might actually be the best advertisement for it.

29:24.000 --> 29:29.000
By the start of 2018, her social media presence had ground to a rather slow hole.

29:29.000 --> 29:34.000
In December, her Instagram was deleted, and basically she became a punchline,

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
rather than having any actual presence of her own.

29:36.000 --> 29:42.000
This is always what happens to people who do this, they are addicted to that high that flash of attention can provide,

29:42.000 --> 29:47.000
but therefore have to engage in more and more antics to retain the audience's attention,

29:47.000 --> 29:51.000
but she was beginning to sound like a broken record, nothing was fresh,

29:51.000 --> 29:54.000
and she had to escalate the antics even more,

29:54.000 --> 29:58.000
and probably pushed on by a group of peers who didn't have their dignity at stake,

29:58.000 --> 30:03.000
she did what many people in her position did, she went deeper and deeper,

30:03.000 --> 30:06.000
and this led to worse and worse results.

30:07.000 --> 30:14.000
When you do stuff with the attention, the attention in the moment might feel good,

30:14.000 --> 30:20.000
if you've cultivated that reputation as that crazy girl who's just out of control, then who cares?

30:20.000 --> 30:23.000
If you'll expect that from you anyway, how else should you behave?

30:23.000 --> 30:27.000
I mean, if you tried to change it, then it would just compromise that reputation,

30:27.000 --> 30:31.000
that you've worked so hard to cultivate, right? Wouldn't it?

30:31.000 --> 30:35.000
As mentioned in numerous other videos, such hype does not sustain itself,

30:35.000 --> 30:40.000
and Woah Vicky's gimmick was never particularly deep and was running out of gas rather rapidly,

30:40.000 --> 30:46.000
yet she felt constrained by her already existent reputation, and didn't want to run the hype to empty.

30:46.000 --> 30:51.000
However, once the gas runs out, you're left with the fact that you made the headlines very briefly for outlandish behaviour,

30:51.000 --> 30:56.000
that by this point you'd hope would not represent you, yet the people who see you will remember you for that,

30:56.000 --> 31:01.000
sometimes you can argue your way out of it, as someone who is a victim of a brief spotlight not chosen by them,

31:01.000 --> 31:07.000
but people like Vicky were seen as indulgent of that reputation, and constantly clawing for the spotlight once more,

31:07.000 --> 31:11.000
which meant that their cases often came across as even less sympathetic.

31:11.000 --> 31:15.000
The start of 2018 was definitely where everything began to hit rock bottom for Vicky,

31:15.000 --> 31:21.000
with three specific incidents that I think really outlined the slope into oblivion that she had decided to embark on.

31:21.000 --> 31:25.000
As said, it's hard enough for the public to forget about the reputation that you might give yourself,

31:25.000 --> 31:30.000
however, there's one institution with an even better memory, that is of course the legal system.

31:30.000 --> 31:37.000
Once you're in their bad books, they will never forget, and it's something that will be brought up when conducting routine actions,

31:37.000 --> 31:41.000
such as applying for jobs, applying for visas, you want a clean record,

31:41.000 --> 31:46.000
particularly if the persona that you're renowned for being won't sustain itself online.

31:46.000 --> 31:49.000
I don't really think I'm black, I'm black, I'm black.

31:49.000 --> 31:53.000
In January, she came to the top realisation that she may not actually be black,

31:53.000 --> 31:56.000
and this clearly had an emotional toll on her.

31:56.000 --> 32:00.000
Well, you know, I joke, but basically the next few months were undoubtedly awful,

32:00.000 --> 32:06.000
and were mostly spent trying to recapture relevance through attention that no one else was really that willing to provide.

32:06.000 --> 32:11.000
However, I can't fault her for trying, but I will fault her for everything else that followed.

32:12.000 --> 32:15.000
Why are you doing that to her? Get off of her!

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
Get off of her!

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
Get off of her!

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
Get off of her!

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
Get off her like that!

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
Get off her like that!

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
Get off her like that!

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
Get off her like that!

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
Get off her like that!

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
Get off her like that!

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
Get off her like that!

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
Get off her like that!

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
Get off her like that!

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
Get off her like that!

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
Get off her like that!

32:43.000 --> 32:48.000
In February 2018, she was arrested for allegedly causing a disturbance with a police officer.

32:48.000 --> 32:53.000
Apparently, she was asked to depart from a department store, and she did not oblige,

32:53.000 --> 32:57.000
and then more security became involved, and she resisted, and then the police were involved,

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
and this led to her arrest.

32:59.000 --> 33:03.000
It doesn't seem like there was a serious conviction, maybe because she was a minor,

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
maybe because the report isn't as it seemed.

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
It's not my place to comment on that part,

33:07.000 --> 33:11.000
but it seems likely that Woah Vicky's attitude was quickly following through onto her real life,

33:11.000 --> 33:17.000
and as noted, once the line between your enabled persona and the real repercussions that your behaviour has becomes blurred,

33:17.000 --> 33:21.000
well, you lose your grip on the consequences that you may face.

33:21.000 --> 33:25.000
Despite the embarrassment and the nature of such an incident, she didn't really gain much attention from it.

33:25.000 --> 33:31.000
Her new Instagram was gradually gaining back followers, but certainly not at the rate someone with a milly would have hoped for.

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
Then in the following month came the rise of Lil Tay.

33:33.000 --> 33:39.000
I spoke about her a while back, but she was basically the product of a culture that really should have been put to a stop then and there.

33:39.000 --> 33:45.000
The obsession of that contrast between innocent and sweet, and braggadocious and aggressive and basically hood.

33:45.000 --> 33:50.000
People just love to see that sort of gangster talk come from someone who really shouldn't be saying it.

33:50.000 --> 33:54.000
At the same time, she also completely exposed how calculated the whole appeal was.

33:54.000 --> 33:57.000
She was someone who was completely being used.

33:57.000 --> 34:01.000
Unlike Vicky, who was a seventeen year old, and still blissfully ignorant mind you,

34:01.000 --> 34:06.000
Lil Tay was a kid who should have been doing other things outside of posting videos flexing online.

34:06.000 --> 34:09.000
That sort of attention would never be good for a nine year old.

34:09.000 --> 34:13.000
With Lil Tay, Daniel Bregoli, and all these other characters joining in these feuds,

34:13.000 --> 34:18.000
Woah Vicky was part of this absurd harebrained Marvel universe,

34:18.000 --> 34:22.000
and although there were people invested, it certainly wasn't for the right reasons.

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
It was basically who could hit a new low.

34:24.000 --> 34:28.000
A lot of the time, these people were calling out some general concept of the haters,

34:28.000 --> 34:32.000
who probably didn't exist until any of them actually started posting those videos.

34:32.000 --> 34:36.000
However, eventually, with the existent beat between Daniel and Vicky,

34:36.000 --> 34:39.000
this escalated with the introduction of new characters.

34:39.000 --> 34:43.000
Vicky turned eighteen on the seventh of March 2018,

34:43.000 --> 34:46.000
and therefore she was at that point legally an adult.

34:46.000 --> 34:50.000
It would be barely a month before this would further escalate in Glendale, California,

34:50.000 --> 34:54.000
where Vicky and Daniel finally had their long anticipated showdown.

34:55.000 --> 34:56.000
You wanna run somewhere?

34:57.000 --> 34:58.000
You wanna run somewhere?

35:00.000 --> 35:01.000
Hey, put your shoes on.

35:01.000 --> 35:02.000
Why don't you put your bag down?

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
Tough stuff? Put your bag down, tough stuff?

35:07.000 --> 35:08.000
Hit me! Hit me, bitch!

35:09.000 --> 35:10.000
Hit me!

35:11.000 --> 35:12.000
I'm right here! I'm right here!

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
You coming out of me, so you hit me!

35:15.000 --> 35:16.000
You're so about it!

35:18.000 --> 35:19.000
You're so about it, you're so make it bad!

35:20.000 --> 35:23.000
The fuck? Oh, he's doing shit on camera, Vicky, do something about it!

35:23.000 --> 35:24.000
Okay, then do it, then!

35:35.000 --> 35:38.000
It was about as anticlimactic as one could expect,

35:38.000 --> 35:41.000
and only further served to embarrass the Instagram sensation.

35:41.000 --> 35:45.000
Lil Tay, backed by her brother, was also there to get in on the clout fest

35:45.000 --> 35:48.000
and try and involve herself in this clash of the titans.

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
This showdown brought plenty of attention,

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
and the commentators were all over it,

35:52.000 --> 35:55.000
expressing their excitement at the sheer chaos that was being wrought.

35:55.000 --> 35:58.000
However, there was something a bit more technical at play,

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
because now Vicky had turned 18,

36:00.000 --> 36:03.000
and whether she wanted to admit it or not, she was a responsible adult,

36:03.000 --> 36:06.000
and this was something that she noted in a video about the instance.

36:06.000 --> 36:12.000
For all you dumbass kids that keep commenting about me in a bad baby situation,

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
y'all don't even know what really happened.

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
That bitch is scary.

36:16.000 --> 36:21.000
That bitch snuck me from behind while I was on the ground trying to grab my purse.

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
Let me tell y'all something.

36:23.000 --> 36:26.000
This bitch waited until I was 18 to really fight me.

36:26.000 --> 36:29.000
Like, bitch, we had beef for a whole year.

36:29.000 --> 36:32.000
I just turned 18, and then you wanna fight me?

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
Bregoli was someone who was not an adult.

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
Now, we know that she hadn't waited tactically.

36:36.000 --> 36:40.000
We actually know that at this point, this whole feud was completely fake.

36:40.000 --> 36:44.000
But Vicky did have, at this point, an awareness of possible consequences

36:44.000 --> 36:48.000
that her behavior might ensue, and this was about to become very serious.

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
At the end of the day, this may be one big act,

36:50.000 --> 36:53.000
but you have to make sure the other person isn't on the joke.

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
With the Bregoli fight, it's okay.

36:55.000 --> 36:58.000
No one else has to understand it's fake as long as the people feuding do.

36:58.000 --> 37:01.000
There's no one with huge stakes in this race.

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
There's no big gang behind you.

37:03.000 --> 37:06.000
But what happens when the act goes too far?

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
They hatin', but the money keep dancin'.

37:08.000 --> 37:11.000
I ain't doin' shit unless I get a fraction.

37:11.000 --> 37:14.000
Bad baby, you is not with the action.

37:14.000 --> 37:17.000
You find that savage, bitch, you not with the action.

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
In April slash May, around the same time,

37:19.000 --> 37:24.000
Woah Vicky made a video to one of her songs that ended up on World Star Hip Hop.

37:24.000 --> 37:28.000
This received a significant amount of attention, obviously a lot of negative attention.

37:28.000 --> 37:31.000
One of these people who did not respond well was rapper Snoop Dogg.

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
He was not pleased about the promotion of this,

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
so he expressed his dissatisfaction.

37:35.000 --> 37:39.000
I'll see if I can find these clips from the vault, but I'm not too optimistic.

37:39.000 --> 37:42.000
This is just people's word, but it seems pretty believable.

37:42.000 --> 37:45.000
Anyhow, this provoked a response from Vicky,

37:45.000 --> 37:49.000
who clearly felt like she had to assert herself on Snoop Dogg's turf.

37:49.000 --> 37:52.000
All I'll say is that it was slightly ill-advised.

38:03.000 --> 38:13.000
Yes, this was a video of her threatening real gangster Snoop Dogg.

38:13.000 --> 38:17.000
Not a joke, not a meme, just a really, really bad idea.

38:17.000 --> 38:20.000
Regardless, Snoop Dogg obviously didn't take it too well,

38:20.000 --> 38:23.000
but took it with a level of professionalism that you'd expect

38:23.000 --> 38:28.000
from someone having to deal with basically what seemed like a rowdy teenager.

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
I can't believe you said something about me.

38:30.000 --> 38:33.000
I'm going to leave it alone though, because you don't know no better.

38:33.000 --> 38:36.000
And them goofball ass niggas you got with you, they don't know no better either.

38:36.000 --> 38:39.000
That's why I'm in the gym, so I can fuck one of y'all up on sight.

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
No, I'm just playing.

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
Oh my God, what does hip-hop come to?

38:46.000 --> 38:49.000
Either way, she quickly backpedaled and apologised.

38:49.000 --> 38:53.000
Do I say that we apologise to Snoop Dogg? You know what I'm saying?

38:53.000 --> 38:57.000
On behalf of what he said and what I said, you know what I'm saying?

38:57.000 --> 39:00.000
Because he really didn't know what he said because somebody told him what he said.

39:00.000 --> 39:03.000
Because I was out there doing my own thing, so I ain't hearing him say that.

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
You know what I'm saying? Somebody told him what to say.

39:05.000 --> 39:08.000
He really didn't know what that meant. You know what I'm saying?

39:08.000 --> 39:12.000
Like, we shouldn't have listened, because at the end of the day, we our own person.

39:12.000 --> 39:16.000
We can make our own decisions, but sometimes it just be like that when it be in the moment, you feel me?

39:16.000 --> 39:19.000
Like, people be telling us what to do, and we just be listening.

39:19.000 --> 39:23.000
By the end of the day, we learned our lesson. We going to stop all that listening to folk.

39:23.000 --> 39:26.000
The wise thing to do, all things considered.

39:26.000 --> 39:33.000
But it's clear at this point, she was becoming far too invested in the persona, and it was becoming dangerous.

39:33.000 --> 39:40.000
Here she was, with other clueless kids, involving herself in something she clearly didn't understand.

39:40.000 --> 39:48.000
She may understand that she's not black, but she was still trying to assert herself in a culture that only has idols on the grittiest of terms.

39:48.000 --> 39:54.000
Vicky was trying to enter a culture that she didn't understand, and it was time that she took a step back.

39:54.000 --> 39:59.000
Vicky is white, but she's more than that. You can be white and have a rough upbringing.

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
You can be from a really nasty area.

40:01.000 --> 40:06.000
But Vicky, in spite of her struggles, clearly never had that intimate experience.

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
She was completely out of her depth.

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
Now, I do not hate her for that.

40:10.000 --> 40:16.000
She didn't choose the family that she was born into, and if she wants to become more culturally experienced, then who am I to take that away?

40:16.000 --> 40:20.000
But it became clear that it was not about the cultural experience that Vicky was engaged in.

40:20.000 --> 40:25.000
She was engaged in the grandstanding persona that many actual rappers broadcast to their audience.

40:25.000 --> 40:32.000
But the difference is, these rappers only behave that way because they've probably had the experience that has hardened them to having that outlook.

40:32.000 --> 40:36.000
With someone like Vicky, it's just a front, it's a persona, she's not gangster.

40:36.000 --> 40:44.000
All the cat fights and online ranting showed someone who was gleefully out of touch, and to be honest, if I was Snoop Dogg, I'd be kinda pissed off too.

40:44.000 --> 40:51.000
Imagine WorldStarHipHop publishing a video from Woah Vicky and not the numerous artists who probably deserved that platform more,

40:51.000 --> 40:58.000
and probably needed it more, because they actually experienced the backgrounds that they claimed to represent, and didn't have a load of money to already flex.

40:58.000 --> 41:04.000
Vicky represented the most vapid elements of hip-hop culture, the sort of blind acceptance that someone has money,

41:04.000 --> 41:12.000
and the erosion of the visibility of actual experiences that makes the acquisition of income a victorious feeling for those who have actually been impoverished.

41:12.000 --> 41:19.000
So yeah, going all big man, threatening someone who has a legitimate problem with what you represent is probably a bad idea,

41:19.000 --> 41:26.000
and I think that was probably the wake-up call she needed, because if she wanted to talk the talk, she was gonna be forced to walk the walk eventually.

41:26.000 --> 41:34.000
It was also important to note that in spite of the infamy that this had obtained her, this didn't really gain her much attention on the socials other than Instagram,

41:34.000 --> 41:37.000
and even then, it didn't seem to be the best sort of publicity.

41:38.000 --> 41:45.000
The statement, any publicity is good publicity, may be true if that's the brand you seek, but the problem is, once the bad publicity has died down,

41:45.000 --> 41:50.000
you'll either cascade into the pits of oblivion, or go out doing something incredibly stupid.

41:50.000 --> 41:55.000
It seems that Vicky had the latter in mind when she made that video threatening Snoop Doggy Dogg here,

41:55.000 --> 41:58.000
but by the end of the week, she was seeing a very different tune.

41:58.000 --> 42:07.000
I didn't really mean to disrespect nobody in that type of way, I got respect for him, and his people, you know what I'm saying?

42:07.000 --> 42:12.000
I realised what I said was wrong, but I would rather apologise to him.

42:12.000 --> 42:17.000
Now this could have been the end of Vicky, honestly, I think many of us expected it to be.

42:17.000 --> 42:25.000
It's clear that she didn't actually have the guts to push on in that lane, but at the same time, it may have been the worst time to give up too,

42:25.000 --> 42:32.000
because not only would she be exiting the game with a terrible reputation, she'd leave the game with a pathetic one.

42:32.000 --> 42:36.000
No one inside or outside of this industry was going to take her seriously,

42:36.000 --> 42:41.000
so the only other option was to use what she had left of her platform to retain her credibility,

42:41.000 --> 42:46.000
and she only had a limited amount of time, a heavy task all things considered,

42:46.000 --> 42:51.000
because she had spent nearly a year at this point building her reputation up as anything but that.

42:51.000 --> 42:57.000
However, what we were about to witness was perhaps one of the most incredible redemption arcs in history.

43:21.000 --> 43:27.000
At the end of the day, Woah Vicky's story is morally dubious, but she did have one ace up her sleeve,

43:27.000 --> 43:32.000
that she was intimate with an industry that has acted much worse than her in many capacities,

43:32.000 --> 43:39.000
and one of those prime examples was our friend Lil Tay, a child who was caught up unwillingly in a situation they didn't deserve,

43:39.000 --> 43:45.000
so whether she intended to or not, blowing the whistle on Lil Tay's reputation was probably the best thing she could do.

43:45.000 --> 43:50.000
Now at that point, it had already been established that Lil Tay had other people pulling the strings,

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
as if it was not obvious already.

43:52.000 --> 43:57.000
However, having someone perceptibly close and invested in her success as Woah Vicky,

43:57.000 --> 44:01.000
for someone who in many regards could benefit from her doing well,

44:01.000 --> 44:06.000
to have her actually turn around and say no, something's wrong, was an important statement,

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
and a lot of people recognised that.

44:08.000 --> 44:14.000
Let me just start by saying, y'all think this is Lil Tay, this is not Lil Tay, let me tell you.

44:14.000 --> 44:22.000
Lil Tay is a little girl, a little ten year old girl, who came from Canada, Vancouver, who plays ballet,

44:22.000 --> 44:26.000
you know what I'm saying, she don't know nothing about no rappers, she don't know nothing about flexing,

44:26.000 --> 44:32.000
it's her brother that runs her account, it's her brother that tells her what to do, and it's her brother in her ear,

44:32.000 --> 44:36.000
you know what I'm saying, she's only ten years old, she's really a good person,

44:36.000 --> 44:40.000
it's just her brother in her ear, telling her what to do, he makes her cry,

44:40.000 --> 44:46.000
we went to a GQ concert, and she did really good, and afterwards, he started yelling at her,

44:46.000 --> 44:50.000
like, why'd you do that, you did it wrong, duh duh duh duh, and then she started crying,

44:50.000 --> 44:53.000
because she's ten years old, she doesn't know how to handle all that.

44:53.000 --> 44:56.000
Now, I'm not saying that this was a tactical move by any means,

44:56.000 --> 45:01.000
as mentioned throughout the video, I don't feel like she's always been the most self-aware person,

45:01.000 --> 45:05.000
I do feel that her behaviour was, in part, made possible through the enabling of peers,

45:05.000 --> 45:09.000
and the situation may have just resonated with her in that specific moment,

45:09.000 --> 45:14.000
maybe she genuinely related, I feel that it could well have been a moment of sobriety from her behalf,

45:14.000 --> 45:19.000
it just turned out to be very beneficial, because for once, people valued her words,

45:19.000 --> 45:23.000
and I don't think people would have valued her words on any other matter,

45:23.000 --> 45:27.000
so it was the best time to start repairing that reputation,

45:27.000 --> 45:31.000
Vicky needed to take a step back from such a toxic environment,

45:31.000 --> 45:36.000
that sort of stuff, whether put on or real, is not healthy for an individual,

45:36.000 --> 45:40.000
and by doing it in a way that held elements of her character,

45:40.000 --> 45:43.000
while helping another person who was clearly suffering,

45:43.000 --> 45:47.000
she did it in an incredibly honourable, respectful way,

45:47.000 --> 45:51.000
this then gave her the credibility to call out various other aspects of her life,

45:51.000 --> 45:54.000
and for once, many people actually supported her.

45:54.000 --> 45:57.000
I just want to let you know, little Tay, if you are watching this,

45:57.000 --> 46:02.000
like, I've talked with you, it's just like your brother, you know what I'm saying?

46:02.000 --> 46:06.000
I know you did in the day that's your brother, and you know what I'm saying,

46:06.000 --> 46:10.000
y'all close, but you know, despite what he thinks about you,

46:10.000 --> 46:15.000
I really do like you, it's just like, you know, he doesn't like me or whatever,

46:15.000 --> 46:20.000
so it's just gonna be like that, but this video is only for Jason, her brother,

46:21.000 --> 46:24.000
has nothing to do with her, like, she's really a good person,

46:24.000 --> 46:27.000
and she's the person who runs her page and stuff, you know,

46:27.000 --> 46:30.000
he needs to get caught up for what he does because that's messed up.

46:30.000 --> 46:35.000
In a run of videos, she blew the whistle on the sides and the nature of her content.

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
In another one that I've already mentioned,

46:37.000 --> 46:40.000
she called out the fakeness of her beef with Danielle Bregoli,

46:40.000 --> 46:44.000
revealing DMs that essentially showed that the whole dispute was completely orchestrated,

46:44.000 --> 46:47.000
and done with the belief that it would be good publicity for both of them.

46:47.000 --> 46:52.000
This run of whistleblowing on her antics allowed her to restore some level of reputation

46:52.000 --> 46:55.000
as an actually real person who knew who she was.

46:55.000 --> 46:59.000
Basically, like, that's my homegirl, like, we cool in real life,

46:59.000 --> 47:02.000
so basically what happened was, she hit me up,

47:02.000 --> 47:06.000
she's like, yo, let's do this little publicity stunt,

47:06.000 --> 47:10.000
um, you know, it's finna be good for both of us,

47:10.000 --> 47:14.000
we finna be all over the shade room, all over Worldstar,

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
like, this shit finna go up.

47:16.000 --> 47:20.000
I'm like, okay, okay, we can do that, we can do that,

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
you know, all that extra little beef we done did,

47:22.000 --> 47:27.000
it just for the grand, like, we don't really don't like each other,

47:27.000 --> 47:32.000
like, because let me tell y'all, whenever people be beefing on social media,

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
other people eat that shit up.

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
In another video, she talks about her own securities events,

47:36.000 --> 47:39.000
about how she views social pressure on individuals.

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
Once again, she's not the most articulate,

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
but it's decent advice for those who are lacking self confidence.

47:44.000 --> 47:51.000
So that's just what I got to say today about, you know, um, self confidence,

47:51.000 --> 47:56.000
and loving yourself, you know, no matter what people say,

47:56.000 --> 47:59.000
remember beauty comes within, not on the outside,

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
outside look cool or whatever.

48:01.000 --> 48:05.000
For the moment, Vicky's provocative content was great publicity,

48:05.000 --> 48:09.000
but it was also a publicity that would either lead to you going down a road

48:09.000 --> 48:12.000
with legitimate danger, as demonstrated by those few run-ins,

48:12.000 --> 48:15.000
or burning out because you can't top those antics.

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
It's the classic SpongeBob rip my pants gag,

48:17.000 --> 48:21.000
once you've escalated it, repeating it will come with diminished returns every time,

48:21.000 --> 48:25.000
and going over the edge will just lead to you being shot down.

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
A fresh start was the perfect option,

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
although it seemed impossible for her to obtain that,

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
she did it for those she cared about,

48:31.000 --> 48:35.000
in the form of a selfless act that also helped her move away from that behaviour.

48:35.000 --> 48:39.000
Of course, not many people see her as that post-clarity person,

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
but I guess she is there now.

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
I'm gonna get on a little topic today,

48:43.000 --> 48:47.000
it's gonna be about my relationships,

48:47.000 --> 48:52.000
and, you know, my love life and stuff.

48:52.000 --> 48:56.000
In another video, she talks about her ex, pappy JJ Lil Rot, you know the drill.

48:56.000 --> 48:59.000
On principle, it was a vague video with not too much said,

48:59.000 --> 49:02.000
but it was one where I came to a realisation,

49:02.000 --> 49:07.000
that this identity that she had built that persona off was a part of her,

49:07.000 --> 49:11.000
and it was more than just something that she perceived as trendy,

49:11.000 --> 49:14.000
but something that she cared about with people that she cared about,

49:14.000 --> 49:17.000
and then the strangest thing happened,

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
I began to feel sympathy for her,

49:19.000 --> 49:23.000
which honestly, with everything considered was one of the strangest feelings,

49:23.000 --> 49:26.000
but I kind of understand it.

49:26.000 --> 49:29.000
I still love him, but it is what it is sometimes.

49:29.000 --> 49:33.000
I learned in life, you gotta love people from a distance.

49:33.000 --> 49:37.000
Okay, let's say this, my mistake I made with John.

49:37.000 --> 49:41.000
If I had kept my expectation out of it, my feelings wouldn't have been hurt.

49:41.000 --> 49:45.000
Wouldn't have been hurt, you know,

49:45.000 --> 49:49.000
because if you keep your expectations out of it, you can still be cool with them.

49:49.000 --> 49:52.000
Me and John are still friends, we cool, it is what it is.

49:52.000 --> 49:57.000
We was friends before that, and that's why I feel like the best relationships come from friendships,

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
because, you know what I'm saying,

49:59.000 --> 50:03.000
you gotta be able to be around a person, be cool with a person.

50:03.000 --> 50:06.000
They can be your homeboy, be your homegirl,

50:06.000 --> 50:09.000
and then y'all get in a relationship, then y'all do what you do with your kids,

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
you whoop the whoop.

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
If you have a kid, you are not supposed to tell them,

50:13.000 --> 50:16.000
oh, your dad this, your dad that, because being a kid, they don't know no better.

50:16.000 --> 50:19.000
They're going to believe you, and they're going to treat their parent like shit.

50:19.000 --> 50:22.000
You should never want your kid to hate their parent.

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
At the end of the day, that is their parent.

50:24.000 --> 50:27.000
Your beef ain't got nothing to do with that kid, nothing.

50:27.000 --> 50:31.000
Don't put your kid in that beef, your kid is young, your kid don't know.

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
You know what I'm saying, that's his dad.

50:33.000 --> 50:36.000
No matter what, that's always going to be their dad, they only get one dad, they only get one mom.

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
So why would you want to make them hate them?

50:38.000 --> 50:42.000
The video is mature, has a lot of genuinely introspective and well thought out statements,

50:42.000 --> 50:45.000
even if not expressed with the greatest articulation,

50:45.000 --> 50:49.000
but it showed a maturity, one that I had not observed before,

50:49.000 --> 50:53.000
and it demonstrated she had much more awareness than I originally gave her credit for.

50:53.000 --> 50:59.000
However, I don't know how long that awareness was there for, as stated in previous parts,

50:59.000 --> 51:02.000
her persona was not the smoothest of adaptations.

51:02.000 --> 51:08.000
Y'all think I'm just like stupid and slow, but I'm actually very smart in person,

51:08.000 --> 51:14.000
and I know I should start showing that side on Instagram, but I didn't realize that until now.

51:14.000 --> 51:19.000
In the comment section, there were a load of people implying that actually she'd played us all,

51:19.000 --> 51:25.000
a game of 4D chess where she works her way up to the top with trashy antics and then refines her brand.

51:25.000 --> 51:30.000
Was that true? Was that the case? Have we all been played?

51:30.000 --> 51:34.000
But, you know what I'm saying, I realize now that, you know what I'm saying,

51:34.000 --> 51:38.000
you shouldn't do everything for clout because, let me tell y'all, no matter what everybody's saying,

51:38.000 --> 51:41.000
not all policies are different because y'all gonna keep that 100 with y'all.

51:41.000 --> 51:45.000
So, you know what I'm saying, think before you do some dumb shit on the internet.

51:45.000 --> 51:50.000
No, I don't think so. As said, I think it's more likely that she got into a character

51:50.000 --> 51:54.000
that she became over-invested in with the wrong type of reinforcement,

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
and eventually she snapped out of it.

51:56.000 --> 52:00.000
It would've taken a genius to really work out exactly where the trends were going,

52:00.000 --> 52:04.000
and I still don't think any of those escapades were a particularly smart route,

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
and I think she understands that too.

52:06.000 --> 52:10.000
No one's gonna convince me that an altercation with a security guard and a police officer

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
was a good idea that somehow embedded her career.

52:12.000 --> 52:16.000
No one could've ascertained the presence of Lil Tay, and how that would provide an opportunity

52:16.000 --> 52:20.000
for the post-chaos clarity that Vicky demonstrated in that moment,

52:20.000 --> 52:26.000
and would open up the numerous opportunities to basically change herself that would come about in the future.

52:26.000 --> 52:30.000
It was, of course, a clout game. These things are a clout game.

52:30.000 --> 52:35.000
We know she didn't exactly believe it, but she was invested in it for a reason,

52:35.000 --> 52:41.000
and I think she eventually came to the realization that not everything is worth the clout that people ascribe to it.

52:41.000 --> 52:46.000
And as she puts it so eloquently, not all pussy is good pussy.

52:46.000 --> 52:51.000
So what is the good pussy that Victoria is aspiring for nowadays?

52:51.000 --> 52:56.000
Oh wait, she said publicity. That was my error. I do apologise, did I?

52:56.000 --> 53:02.000
Unfortunately, my biased hearing is now getting the better of me, because you know me, guys, I love the pussy.

53:02.000 --> 53:05.000
Anyhow, back to the point, let's go into our final part.

53:06.000 --> 53:11.000
I wanna come out here and really live on my own and learn how to be responsible with y'all.

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
I feel like if I live on my own, I'd grow up.

53:13.000 --> 53:17.000
You know, I feel like I am growing up at my age, but I really grow up.

53:17.000 --> 53:21.000
Like, no cap, like, cause you get to see the real world.

53:29.000 --> 53:34.000
In some videos, Vicky speaks about her own issues with fitting in with the world,

53:35.000 --> 53:40.000
and although her struggles don't align with those on a racial basis, they're still struggles nonetheless.

53:40.000 --> 53:47.000
They were merely struggles at the time, in my opinion, she sought to remedy in a rather outlandish and unfortunately embarrassing way.

53:47.000 --> 53:50.000
However, that doesn't undermine the struggles that she may have gone through,

53:50.000 --> 53:55.000
and the ways that she may have wanted to have been accepted that were probably even more destructive.

53:55.000 --> 53:59.000
It's just that her struggles didn't necessarily align with behavior that she prescribed,

54:00.000 --> 54:06.000
behaviors that were aggressively unpleasant, unnecessarily provocative, and delusional if she actually believed them.

54:06.000 --> 54:09.000
And although I'd argue that she was aware of her racial shortcomings,

54:09.000 --> 54:15.000
I still think there was an element of wishful thinking that led her to try and reach that persona.

54:15.000 --> 54:19.000
She's never gonna fully shake the stigma that she's gonna be remembered for,

54:19.000 --> 54:25.000
and that's why I don't think it's some galaxy brain calculation she clearly regrets it to.

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
Was it contrived? For sure.

54:27.000 --> 54:32.000
But I think it was born out of a desire to find belongings that she had not found in other environments,

54:32.000 --> 54:37.000
and when it caught on as a persona, she wanted to use it for the clout and the validation,

54:37.000 --> 54:42.000
surrounding herself with people who would support her for it, and maybe for reasons less than wholesome sometimes.

54:42.000 --> 54:45.000
It was a huge risk, and it still is, you know?

54:45.000 --> 54:49.000
There are things that she said and did that could follow her until the end.

54:49.000 --> 54:55.000
However, for what it's worth, even though she's arguably one of the most ludicrous people who I have ever covered,

54:55.000 --> 54:59.000
I do think she might deserve some sort of life ahead of her.

54:59.000 --> 55:03.000
And it feels weird, after all the insensitive garbage that she indulged in, that I'd say that.

55:03.000 --> 55:10.000
But you know, I'm not one to take away the belonging that she clearly genuinely finds within her community,

55:10.000 --> 55:14.000
and I do genuinely believe that she feels at home with the people that she surrounds herself with.

55:14.000 --> 55:18.000
It's also just a case of knowing the boundaries and respecting them within that community too,

55:18.000 --> 55:21.000
something that she lacked for a long time.

55:21.000 --> 55:24.000
You step into someone's house and you respect their rules.

55:24.000 --> 55:28.000
I think that has to be kept in mind when you're on the internet, when you're online,

55:28.000 --> 55:32.000
provoking yourself onto a culture that you may not be wholly familiar with.

55:32.000 --> 55:38.000
And arguably, what may have happened is that familiarization with a greater culture eventually,

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
outside of her circle of friends.

55:40.000 --> 55:44.000
She may have realized and become more sensitive to the repercussions.

55:44.000 --> 55:48.000
What she says amongst her friends is her and her friends' discretion to a large extent.

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
I don't really care about that.

55:50.000 --> 55:55.000
However, when you're broadcasting yourself to a large amount of people, the context changes,

55:55.000 --> 56:01.000
and when she finally grew up, it probably dawned on her that she would be held to a much more significant standard,

56:01.000 --> 56:06.000
and that persona wasn't worth maintaining for the sake of spikes in attention that it provides.

56:06.000 --> 56:10.000
So she did change, and it's arguably worked out much better for her,

56:10.000 --> 56:15.000
even if it doesn't give her the instant attention that she sometimes craves.

56:16.000 --> 56:21.000
Do y'all puss-ass hoes see me right now? Makeup? Done? Hair done? A puss-ass hoe could never, but

56:21.000 --> 56:24.000
I just want to make this video to all my females out there, like,

56:24.000 --> 56:27.000
don't let these little boys distract you from getting your money.

56:27.000 --> 56:30.000
Don't let them stress you out. Don't let them lie to you. You better than that.

56:30.000 --> 56:35.000
At the end of the day, just stay focused, get to the money, because at the end of the day, that's the only thing that matter, not them. Period.

56:35.000 --> 56:40.000
And don't let these little puss-ass hoes distract you either, because they could never. Remember that.

56:40.000 --> 56:46.000
She's still rather aggressive, and likes to flex her income in ways that, frankly, I find rather excessive.

56:46.000 --> 56:51.000
I'm still not entirely sure why anyone wants to watch people like that.

56:51.000 --> 56:56.000
She still releases music that I do not find the most pleasant to the ears, but hey,

56:56.000 --> 56:59.000
to the people wondering, yes, she has changed.

56:59.000 --> 57:02.000
She's not really abusing the race card anymore.

57:02.000 --> 57:05.000
Generally, the target of her rants have become the puss-ass hoes.

57:05.000 --> 57:09.000
A much better aim than people who can't say the n-word like she does.

57:09.000 --> 57:14.000
You puss-ass hoes can never take your mama to Jamaica. This is a real hot girl summer.

57:14.000 --> 57:19.000
I take my mama on trips. What's your hoes all about taking your mama on trips?

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
Between Jamaica.

57:21.000 --> 57:24.000
And you know what? Damn those puss-ass hoes.

57:24.000 --> 57:31.000
Woah Vicky is going to other countries, and you are still restricted to your own land borders due to a lack of monetary income.

57:31.000 --> 57:35.000
It's not particularly inspired, but it's not exceptionally bad.

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
I've seen much worse.

57:37.000 --> 57:43.000
As for her YouTube content, it has become fairly generic stuff, typically the challenges and so on.

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
It's rather harmless, must I add.

57:45.000 --> 57:51.000
It's not going to provoke any exceptional attention, but for people who want to follow her work, I can't take that away.

57:51.000 --> 57:56.000
I think she'd always be the most successful on Instagram because she's best in small doses.

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
For me, no doses at all.

57:58.000 --> 58:04.000
Once you take away the provocation, there's not really too much to her personality in my opinion, but that's how I view it.

58:04.000 --> 58:10.000
On some positive notes, it seems like she's reconnecting with her mother, which is nice, and she's also an actual adult,

58:10.000 --> 58:16.000
so people following her for her pictures and photos, good job, you're actually following a legal adult for once.

58:16.000 --> 58:24.000
A lot of her most controversial videos have been removed by herself, and she seems happy to do that, and I understand why.

58:24.000 --> 58:30.000
You can still find those videos, she's not shutting them down necessarily, but you can't have it all your own way,

58:30.000 --> 58:33.000
and I think that's something that Woah Vicky understands.

58:33.000 --> 58:40.000
The story of Woah Vicky is an interesting arc, because it began long before the character that we were introduced to on the website came to be.

58:40.000 --> 58:47.000
A person who clearly became invested in a culture found solace in the idea that they could become one with these people who

58:47.000 --> 58:50.000
septed her, and reinforced that behaviour.

58:50.000 --> 58:57.000
However, that quickly manifested into conduct, whether contrived or not, that generated a lot of controversy,

58:57.000 --> 59:04.000
and grew into this destructive persona that ultimately became more of a detriment with every publicity stunt partaken.

59:04.000 --> 59:11.000
I don't know the exact mindset that created this, but I don't think she's just some bourgeois girl trying to cash in on a different culture.

59:11.000 --> 59:18.000
She clearly has her privileges, but it's not without the struggles either, she just needed a more productive way to deal with it,

59:18.000 --> 59:25.000
and if she's found that now, even if I wish she hadn't gone that route, I'm not gonna turn her away from her destination.

59:25.000 --> 59:28.000
I hope people know you love them while they still here.

59:28.000 --> 59:33.000
Motherfuckers can be here and be gone the next day, you better show them you love them.

59:33.000 --> 59:41.000
You beefing with somebody, you ain't talking to somebody, you got pressure with somebody, you ain't talk to somebody in your family in a long time because they did this to you.

59:41.000 --> 59:44.000
But you don't know what they did to me, I don't give a fuck what they did to you.

59:44.000 --> 59:49.000
End that shit, squash that shit, call them, pull up on them. It ain't worth it.

59:50.000 --> 59:54.000
So that was the video, it was quite the long one, I'll say that much.

59:54.000 --> 01:00:04.000
And I don't know, I just found like I had a lot to say, and things that I was expecting to find out didn't quite turn out the way they seemed to be.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
And so when I was surprised, that's what happens.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:12.000
I wanna give a big shoutout to the editors, they've done a fantastic job, I cannot thank them enough.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:18.000
I think that they, you know, make such a genuine difference to me.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:30.000
The $10 patreons right now on screen, $50 patreons, I have to give a big thanks to Caroline, Sarah, Lizbeth, Sumhala Baloo, and the Specter Angel, thank you so much.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:38.000
And the $100 patreons, Adam, Michael, Brandon, Jungk, thank you so much, it means a hell of a lot to me.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:42.000
It does not go without notice, it does not go without notice for sure.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:51.000
Also, if you wanna reach me, my Twitter is at TheRightOpinion, Facebook too, Discord, all there, if you wanna find me.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
And so that's where I'm gonna be.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:01:01.000
I don't really have too much else to add, I love everyone a lot, I'm pretty tired, but I'm okay, we're hanging in there.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:10.000
It's been a good recording, in spite of its rather long topic, I hope that the video is a good one, and I hope people enjoy it.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:20.000
It's gonna be weird if this is my longest video of all time, but hey, that's the way the cards fall sometimes, the cards do whatever they wanna do.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:24.000
But yeah, I'm TheRightOpinion, and I will see you in the next one.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:48.000
Thanks for watching!
