Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with

00:24.900 --> 00:29.320
too much free time, and Lil Tay. I don't normally go into such topics, I think it's best to

00:29.320 --> 00:33.080
leave the reaction commentator to their own devices, but every now and then something

00:33.080 --> 00:38.160
deeply disconcerting comes along, something that drives me to action, and today that person

00:38.160 --> 00:43.240
is Lil Tay. Lil Tay is a child, 9 years old to be specific, she likes to make that very

00:43.240 --> 00:57.440
clear in her videos, in case you hadn't fucking noticed.

00:57.440 --> 01:01.920
She's an instagram star and basically posts a lot of videos of her gloating over her fortune,

01:01.920 --> 01:06.400
and boy, everyone just eats that shit up. She socialises with rap virtuosos such as

01:06.400 --> 01:11.060
Chief Keef. In case you didn't know, Lil Tay has a load of houses, and a load of cars,

01:11.060 --> 01:15.800
and a load of money. More money than you, the viewer, yes, she be flexing, constantly

01:15.800 --> 01:18.860
there to remind you of how inadequate your own life is.

01:18.860 --> 01:22.840
On the surface it seems like another embarrassing new low for social media, but when I sat down

01:22.840 --> 01:26.360
to think about it, many questions came into my head, many things that I couldn't shake,

01:26.360 --> 01:29.480
things that I had to find out for myself, most people just point and laugh at their

01:29.480 --> 01:32.920
antics, but that's underselling what's going on here, isn't it?

01:32.920 --> 01:37.080
Today I will tell you a different story, maybe one of tragedy, maybe one of exploitation,

01:37.080 --> 01:41.100
that many men dare not to go. When I started this script it was a simple concept, observe

01:41.100 --> 01:45.060
and dissect the Lil Tay situation, however as I researched more and more, the truth became

01:45.060 --> 01:48.760
warringly clear to me. Am I going mad? There is a 9 year old behaving like a stripper who

01:48.760 --> 01:53.940
just cashed her first paycheck and people are going, huh, that's weird. You know what,

01:53.940 --> 01:57.900
it is fucking weird. And today we're going to go into Lil Tay's mind.

01:57.900 --> 02:05.340
Back a few months ago I did a video covering Wobe Vicky and Martina Big, basically explaining

02:05.340 --> 02:09.540
why being transracial makes no sense, and much less sense in comparison to being something

02:09.540 --> 02:13.260
like transgender. I gave Victoria here quite a roasting, and to be honest, she deserved

02:13.260 --> 02:16.940
it. However that did not dissuade her, and 8 months on she's still wreaking havoc on

02:16.940 --> 02:19.940
the world as we know it. I hoped it was a fad that would fade into irrelevance, but

02:19.940 --> 02:24.140
given the fact that her and Danielle Bregoli have become the darlings of reaction commentary,

02:24.140 --> 02:25.700
they have only grown in prominence.

02:25.700 --> 02:29.660
Speaking of Danielle Bregoli, that is someone else I also covered, albeit briefly in my

02:29.660 --> 02:33.780
video The Dr Phil Problem, in which I laid out the problem of using children's legitimate

02:33.780 --> 02:37.940
problems for entertainment and posed the question asking if this is really good for them, and

02:37.940 --> 02:41.460
like Wobe Vicky, she has continued to cause a nuisance wherever she decided to drag her

02:41.460 --> 02:45.100
exasperating persona. Now I really should have put two and two together and realised

02:45.100 --> 02:48.400
that these two young bucks were on a collision course, but honestly I just wanted to block

02:48.400 --> 02:52.200
it out of my mind and never speak of these simpletons again. The gods however have no

02:52.200 --> 02:56.720
mercy on my soul, and in April 2018, Wobe Vicky and Danielle Bregoli decided to have

02:56.720 --> 03:01.080
a good bout of fisticuffs. This meant multiple orgasms from the reaction commentators who

03:01.080 --> 03:04.880
couldn't reach for their microphones fast enough. These two females are desperate for

03:04.880 --> 03:08.640
attention, and they will continue to get it, and you know what, I do not blame the people

03:08.640 --> 03:12.120
who give them it. At the end of the day, reaction commentators, news channels, they gotta cover

03:12.120 --> 03:15.480
what's interesting, and what people want to hear, and if they don't cover it, someone

03:15.480 --> 03:18.440
else will. That's the name of the game, and really, although they played a component

03:18.440 --> 03:22.240
in promoting the ridiculous behaviour, there's nothing new about that, they're just a response

03:22.240 --> 03:26.360
rather than a cause. In making a video I have to accept that I might give them attention

03:26.360 --> 03:29.760
too, I just have to try and make sure it's not the sort that they desire. The thing about

03:29.760 --> 03:33.400
the culture that people like Wobe Vicky and Danielle Bregoli have created is nothing short

03:33.400 --> 03:37.360
of a simple shock value concept, essentially human clickbait. If you were to have never

03:37.360 --> 03:41.120
heard of these people, you would inevitably be as intrigued as you would be disturbed.

03:41.120 --> 03:45.560
How can someone like Wobe Vicky claim to be black? How can Danielle Bregoli be so trashy

03:45.560 --> 03:50.200
at her age? These are simple questions, but questions that draw in an audience. However,

03:50.200 --> 03:53.700
when these simple questions are answered, people begin to lose interest, and therefore

03:53.700 --> 03:57.280
these characters create new questions, and new ways to shock their audience that will

03:57.280 --> 04:00.780
keep them invested. This has definitely been aided by commentators who find new ways to

04:00.780 --> 04:04.640
spin these people's existence, whether it's finding out what Wobe Vicky sounds like normally,

04:04.640 --> 04:08.560
or whether it's the influx of Danielle Bregoli clones that fuel the juicy titles for these

04:08.560 --> 04:12.960
creators. These sorts of people are on a lifespan of fame, therefore it is necessary

04:12.960 --> 04:16.520
that they slowly escalate their antics, and Wobe Vicky and Danielle Bregoli's fight

04:16.520 --> 04:20.880
appears to be a climax in both their careers, however if you can't top that then your

04:20.880 --> 04:25.080
career may quickly nosedive, and you'll be running on empty in no time at all. And

04:25.080 --> 04:29.600
this is where Lil Tay comes into it. Squaring off with someone 6 years older than you may

04:29.600 --> 04:33.860
sound like a fucking stupid idea, but not to Lil Tay apparently, who used it as an easy

04:33.860 --> 04:38.740
way to platformer antics, and suddenly everyone was fascinated with this child. Why? How did

04:38.740 --> 04:42.380
we let this happen? Well, my last segment wasn't just meaningless waffle, it actually

04:42.380 --> 04:46.100
intertwines perfectly with what I'm about to state. What interested everyone initially

04:46.100 --> 04:49.780
about the girls aforementioned is that they shocked us, particularly with their audacity

04:49.780 --> 04:53.940
for such an apparent immaturity. However, as people become desensitized to that behaviour,

04:53.940 --> 04:57.620
it will no longer shock them, it will become normal in a way. One thing that Bregoli and

04:57.620 --> 05:02.260
Vicky cannot change are their ages, and have you ever wondered why Lil Tay states her age

05:02.260 --> 05:06.940
so often? Yes. A first Lil Tay stating her age may seem like a way to emphasise how

05:06.940 --> 05:11.500
successful she is in comparison to your elderly broke ass, proof that there is no justice

05:11.500 --> 05:15.380
in this world. But I propose that what she is actually doing, or what she is being prompted

05:15.380 --> 05:19.500
to do, is a marketing technique to ingrain the fact of her age into the viewer's head.

05:19.500 --> 05:23.300
It's shock value, and it's working in absolute rights. One piece of evidence of this act

05:23.300 --> 05:27.720
can be shown in her video where she visits Jake Paul, another role model of the internet.

05:27.720 --> 05:31.800
The video seems incredibly scripted, and Jake Paul himself at points seems prompted to bring

05:31.840 --> 05:35.520
up her relative age, as if it's meant to wow the viewers. Jake Paul, dressed in his

05:35.520 --> 05:40.440
virgin nonce-proof outfit, even says in his most convinced tone that now he thinks about

05:40.440 --> 05:42.760
it, it's super crazy that she's 9 years old.

05:52.280 --> 05:55.880
This is some of the most obvious subliminal marketing I've seen in a while. It mostly

05:55.880 --> 06:00.200
sounds like a broken record repeating the same phrases again and again, just bashing

06:00.200 --> 06:04.480
in the two simple facts, that she's 9, and she doesn't behave like she's 9. She's

06:04.480 --> 06:08.600
antithetic to what a 9 year old should behave like, there's your persona. Find what the

06:08.600 --> 06:12.920
stereotype of yourself is, and go with the opposite. Job done, you have your 15 or even

06:12.920 --> 06:16.940
5 minutes of fame. It's important to note that Lil Tay still has plenty of leeway on

06:16.940 --> 06:21.480
YouTube as she hasn't really uploaded content, and most of it is on Instagram, on an account

06:21.480 --> 06:25.960
that is managed by Miranda Cosgrove of all people. I'm not sure if this is a joke,

06:25.960 --> 06:29.600
but I noticed that she ripped a quote from a Joe Wolfe song for her bio. Though she doesn't

06:29.640 --> 06:33.280
come across to me as a classic rock person, what do I know, it's a bizarre timeline

06:33.280 --> 06:37.280
after all. The other appeal that Lil Tay has is the obvious, the one that we don't really

06:37.280 --> 06:41.960
need to touch on too much because it's basically been gone over before, money. Certain people

06:41.960 --> 06:45.480
have a great preoccupation with regards to how other people spend their money, and Lil

06:45.480 --> 06:49.520
Tay is no exception. Being able to flex is obviously going to attract her people who

06:49.520 --> 06:53.240
want to observe the life that she's living, and almost put themselves in her position

06:53.240 --> 06:57.040
in a way to recapture it. This is certainly not what appeals to me, but it's a common

06:57.040 --> 07:01.760
internet trait, being rich definitely helps your cause. Lil Tay is another step in a direction

07:01.760 --> 07:05.920
that only seems appropriate for 2018, and will be used to try and vulture into some

07:05.920 --> 07:09.800
sort of mainstream clique. Whether it's a step too far for many networks is another

07:09.800 --> 07:13.120
question, but I doubt that many companies will flinch at the opportunity to make money,

07:13.120 --> 07:17.240
regardless of the moral questions, which strangely enough no one seems to be asking. But let's

07:17.240 --> 07:21.240
ask some more questions, and see if we can deduce any reasonable answers.

07:37.240 --> 07:41.720
I think the first thing is, why haven't we been more critical of her age? And this isn't

07:41.720 --> 07:45.520
necessarily to imply that people have ignored it, but it's more been a bit of a joke, and

07:45.520 --> 07:49.560
that's fine, nothing's wrong with a bit of banter with the lads. But it does seem suspicious

07:49.560 --> 07:53.840
and not something that we should be endorsing, the only real issue is that we don't challenge

07:53.840 --> 07:57.480
it because we don't see who is managing her, we don't see who is in charge. This brings

07:57.480 --> 08:01.280
me back to an earlier point as well, she acts completely antithetically to how a 9 year

08:01.280 --> 08:05.520
old should behave. This creates a seemingly paradoxical situation, where people are shocked

08:05.520 --> 08:09.440
by the fact that she is 9 years old, but then go on to judge her on the basis of her actions

08:09.440 --> 08:13.180
as if she were an adult. Just look at the comments, it also doesn't help that social

08:13.180 --> 08:17.340
media acts as a communicative block to the facts that would appear quite clearly if we

08:17.340 --> 08:21.500
were to re-enact these situations in real life. Chief Keef is standing with a 9 year

08:21.500 --> 08:24.820
old, I'm fairly libertarian when it comes to children's prerogatives, but that's pushing

08:24.820 --> 08:29.520
it a bit, isn't it? This also brings us to our next point, the environment. In the commentary

08:29.520 --> 08:33.860
community there is a host of ages, typically ranging from approximately 13 to 40. Now obviously

08:33.860 --> 08:37.220
there are some barriers within that, but if I were to present you with that scenario in

08:37.220 --> 08:40.740
the real world you'd probably do a double take. However given the fact that there is

08:40.740 --> 08:44.900
a behavioural continuity, it often doesn't feel like that, some kids are more mature

08:44.900 --> 08:49.300
than the adults, people are united by the environment so nothing seems out of order.

08:49.300 --> 08:53.540
Lillte utilises these points, firstly she is placed in strictly adult situations and

08:53.540 --> 08:57.580
therefore although her age may stand out it doesn't create an alarm, because her behaviour

08:57.580 --> 09:01.580
although definitely immature is well acclimatised to these scenarios, it's not like Danielle

09:01.580 --> 09:05.260
Bregoli has walked into a nursery and tried to smack a bitch up, though I wouldn't put

09:05.260 --> 09:09.160
it past her, we'll see how desperate she gets. Secondly, everything is sold through

09:09.160 --> 09:12.840
the screen, therefore they have complete domain to be as selective with what they want

09:12.840 --> 09:16.760
to show, allowing them to completely sell the side of Lillte they want to. As I will

09:16.760 --> 09:20.680
come to soon, it appears there is a lot more going on behind the scenes, but we don't think

09:20.680 --> 09:24.480
to question it because the burden of proof would lie on us, and many people aren't willing

09:24.480 --> 09:28.680
to go that extra step. Does that make it right? Hell no, I do not think any 9 year old should

09:28.680 --> 09:31.680
be placed in that position, although I do think some children more well equipped to

09:31.680 --> 09:35.600
fame than others. I think such a culture at the age of 9 is incredibly irresponsible,

09:35.600 --> 09:38.900
that even if they demonstrate some level of shrewdness, it doesn't reflect a general

09:38.900 --> 09:43.480
capability beyond being directed to behave like that. I will expand on why I believe

09:43.480 --> 09:47.360
this to be an extremely fragile situation in a bit, but first we need to ask who is

09:47.360 --> 09:48.360
behind all this.

09:48.360 --> 10:00.680
There have been many questions bouncing around about whose responsibility it is, because

10:00.680 --> 10:04.080
although I would like to think that Lillte is just cruising around the block in a Bentley,

10:04.080 --> 10:07.420
I don't think that she'd get very far if she tried to. Obviously, there is someone

10:07.420 --> 10:10.780
arranging all of this, I don't think it's Miranda Cosgrove strangely enough, I do not

10:10.780 --> 10:14.600
believe hers is the main influence of this story. Let's dig a bit deeper. In one Instagram

10:14.600 --> 10:18.060
post that seems to be staged to the point of parody, she assaults someone riding a scooter

10:48.060 --> 10:51.900
However the discussion was very quickly switched to the person riding the scooter, who seemed

10:51.900 --> 10:56.300
to be an older man of Asian heritage. Many have conspired that it may be in fact a relative

10:56.300 --> 11:00.260
to Lillte, although it's unlikely to be her father whom Lillte claims to have left

11:00.260 --> 11:04.960
when she was very young. It's left very ambiguous, and they could just be baiting

11:04.960 --> 11:08.500
more discussion spurned from the mystery of Lillte's existence, she just appeared to

11:08.500 --> 11:12.020
have materialised out of nowhere, and now we're just rolling with it. However the

11:12.020 --> 11:14.660
clips to me are red herrings, and I'll explain why very soon.

11:14.780 --> 11:19.620
Doesn't it all seem a bit surreal? I mean my theory would typically be that the people involved have basically turned

11:19.620 --> 11:23.740
Lillte into a cash machine, but that seems strange given the fact that her family appeared

11:23.740 --> 11:27.860
to already be loaded. I don't think someone seriously buys the fact that this is Lillte's

11:27.860 --> 11:31.540
own money unless she put her fucking piggy bank into bitcoin while she was still in the

11:31.540 --> 11:36.460
womb. What has been given away by a few clips to me is that Lillte isn't just an actor,

11:36.460 --> 11:39.780
this doesn't seem completely forced, there seems to be some investment from her. Which

11:39.780 --> 11:43.900
is quite astounding, there does seem to be an element of realism, now of course it is

11:43.900 --> 11:47.780
to be taken with a pinch of salt, we cannot necessarily completely dissect the mentality,

11:47.780 --> 11:53.180
but it doesn't appear to me as if it's a 100% puppet show. I say 100% because it's

11:53.180 --> 11:57.020
clear to me from her limited vocabulary and explanations she's being somewhat prompted,

11:57.020 --> 12:00.660
either from those around her, or maybe just the culture that she's immersed in, maybe

12:00.660 --> 12:05.140
she literally got it from TV references. Regardless there does seem to be some sort of mutual

12:05.140 --> 12:09.180
enterprise, Lillte is clearly trying very hard to understand how to behave in these

12:09.180 --> 12:13.340
situations. Lillte claims that her father left when she was very young, generally children

12:13.340 --> 12:17.220
raised by a single parent may have to end up being a lot more self-sufficient, so it

12:17.220 --> 12:21.100
wouldn't necessarily surprise me if Lillte has at least a stake in this herself, even

12:21.100 --> 12:25.180
if someone else is pulling the strings. So with all this information in mind, instinctively

12:25.180 --> 12:29.340
people may point towards her mother, however a couple of videos are pointing towards someone

12:29.340 --> 12:33.660
who may be her brother. Here's a video of him prompting Lillte during the Bregoli confrontation.

12:43.340 --> 13:12.420
I'm not saying anything certain, but this seems very suspicious, and if true demonstrates

13:12.420 --> 13:16.300
to me that there are some rather exploitive practices occurring. Some claim the person

13:16.300 --> 13:20.940
in this clip to be icy ricey, another content creator who hastily deleted his content very

13:20.940 --> 13:25.720
recently and was also a massive rice gun fan, and also has a link to an inactive Instagram

13:25.720 --> 13:30.380
account in which he claims to be quote Lillte's sister. So if you want my prediction, he's

13:30.380 --> 13:35.260
our guy, and he knows what he's doing. Lillte's comprehension in what she's doing seems to

13:35.260 --> 13:39.780
be this elementary understanding on her behalf rather than the full investment in the reasoning

13:39.780 --> 13:43.500
of what comprises a culture, and that makes complete sense, at 9 years old the way you

13:43.500 --> 13:47.300
understand the environments around you is not as developed as it is when you hit your

13:47.300 --> 13:51.220
teenage years, and although she's clearly no idiot, and much sharper than the average

13:51.220 --> 13:55.780
9 year old, it demonstrates what needs to be known about her suitability for such environments.

13:55.780 --> 14:00.980
Not suitable enough. It seems less of a situation where a relative is simply trying to use their

14:00.980 --> 14:05.180
child as an actor to live out their dreams, and more a twisted westernised Asian dad meme

14:05.180 --> 14:09.020
with facilitation where necessary, and whereas pushing for strong grades is certainly one

14:09.020 --> 14:12.500
thing, a child being thrown in the public spotlight with something that they may not

14:12.500 --> 14:16.580
truly understand is walking a tightrope, and I think it's important to discuss the tightrope

14:16.580 --> 14:17.940
that Lillte is walking.

14:27.220 --> 14:31.100
I want to show you a video. This is a video that has been picked up by a few as a sort

14:31.100 --> 14:35.220
of true insight into Lillte's behaviour, and how she feels, however most of them haven't

14:35.220 --> 14:38.980
really looked beyond that, and I think it's a much more important clip to this story than

14:38.980 --> 14:39.780
many let on.

14:53.780 --> 14:57.500
The emotional state is the first thing to notice, to Lillte's credit she has somewhat

14:57.500 --> 15:01.740
thick skin, but even this can go too far. Immediately you're struck by the voice cracks

15:01.740 --> 15:06.060
tone and the fragility that this conveys, this is much more likened to a 9 year olds

15:06.060 --> 15:09.740
behaviour. The next thing to notice is the change in usage of reference to her age, whereas

15:09.740 --> 15:14.500
before it was used as a tool to flex and shock, this time it's used to emphasise her vulnerability,

15:14.500 --> 15:18.100
much more expectant of someone who behaves like that. You can see she's trying to hold

15:18.100 --> 15:21.580
it back, you can see she's trying to repress, there's a lot of withheld emotion, you can

15:21.580 --> 15:25.060
observe this in the colouration of her face, the instability of her lower lip, and the

15:25.060 --> 15:28.820
very panicked breaths interspersed. This is not someone who is ready for the lifestyle

15:28.860 --> 15:32.900
that she is currently pursuing, or she is currently being told to pursue. Lillte states

15:32.900 --> 15:36.980
she loves her mother, it's clear in a way that that familial connection is vital to

15:36.980 --> 15:40.580
her, she is human, and although she's still trying to chuck in the dialect, the yarls,

15:40.580 --> 15:44.660
the attitude, it's all immersed. And then there's a breakdown at the end, and it is

15:44.660 --> 15:45.460
fucking sad.

15:48.740 --> 15:52.780
And you want to know what this tells me. This tells me that Lillte is an emotionally fragile

15:52.780 --> 15:57.100
human being, but she's facading it with a lot of persona, maybe prompted persona, maybe

15:57.100 --> 16:01.140
her own persona, but she's repressing what it is like to be in her position, the actual

16:01.140 --> 16:05.820
turmoil going through her head. And you know who that exactly resembles? Danielle Bregoli.

16:05.820 --> 16:09.660
It's funny that they hate each other, yet they seem to be despicably alike. The issue

16:09.660 --> 16:13.580
is that pain has never left, you search for that resolve, that end of the upset, and it

16:13.580 --> 16:17.420
will never materialise itself if you continue to repress it. There are many things that

16:17.420 --> 16:20.780
I have repressed, and the longer you do it, the further down the slope you slide. All

16:20.780 --> 16:25.040
these unresolved emotions that you want to forever avoid, but you cannot. You can only

16:25.040 --> 16:29.420
bottle it up so much for so long. Whether Lillte was trying to fill the shoes of someone

16:29.420 --> 16:33.240
who was never there, whether she behaves like this to ward off people who may try to inflict

16:33.240 --> 16:37.320
pain, or whether she's just trying to fulfil her family's wishes. That is something that

16:37.320 --> 16:42.320
I cannot decide today. But Lillte is not just some spoiled, fratty kid. And it's kind of

16:42.320 --> 16:46.480
weird to say that because it's what you immediately go with on first impressions. She's loud,

16:46.480 --> 16:50.360
she's obnoxious, she's confrontational, she's everything that you imagine that stereotype

16:50.360 --> 16:54.800
to be. But all it takes is one break of character, and something else reveals itself. Lillte's

16:54.800 --> 16:58.560
behaviour is an act. I certainly don't think she is ready to be in the public spotlight,

16:58.560 --> 17:02.400
and I certainly do not think that this will end well. Plenty of child stars hit the hard

17:02.400 --> 17:06.520
concrete of reality eventually, and people with less of an occupation than her have hit

17:06.520 --> 17:10.540
it harder. And when you build your own fame off something that seems inherently unsustainable

17:10.540 --> 17:14.160
you are just postponing the inevitable. That is the bitter truth. And while the person

17:14.160 --> 17:18.000
who appears to be pulling the strings will probably emerge completely untouched by this,

17:18.000 --> 17:21.360
he will take the profit and she will take the scars. The person involved who seems to

17:21.360 --> 17:25.120
be her brother may be the catalyst of this predicament, and if so I find his actions

17:25.120 --> 17:28.560
to be the most irresponsible. He looks old enough to be aware of the scale of what he

17:28.560 --> 17:32.720
is doing, however maybe not wise enough to realise the possible implications. Only time

17:32.720 --> 17:36.300
will tell. Either way the more I think about the fact that she might be used publicly as

17:36.300 --> 17:40.660
a controversy magnet makes me very annoyed, as this guy seems to have avoided the public

17:40.660 --> 17:45.100
eye altogether while using her to sponge up a hell of a lot of vitriol that many children

17:45.100 --> 17:49.880
her age would not be able to handle at all. We as humans are fascinated with the exceptional,

17:49.880 --> 17:53.840
we love to see humanity go one step further with its craziness every time, and make no

17:53.840 --> 17:58.820
mistake Lil Tay is exceptional, there is no doubt about it. There are clearly many circumstances

17:58.820 --> 18:02.360
that have allowed her to thrive, and upon a time where it appears that we look for something

18:02.360 --> 18:06.260
even more absurd than what we found in where Vicky and Danielle were going we discovered

18:06.260 --> 18:10.200
what the people craved. But I do not believe that it is good for her, I do not believe

18:10.200 --> 18:14.360
that she is just some vapid brat, I believe that there is someone who desperately needs

18:14.360 --> 18:18.160
the right kind of help, but with the current success that her persona provides it will

18:18.160 --> 18:22.640
be seldom found. Her endgame is diametrically opposed with how she wants to get there, I

18:22.640 --> 18:25.960
have no doubt that she wants to do nice things, she'd love to be friendly, she's probably

18:25.960 --> 18:29.760
tried being friendly in the past but now they've found a formula that works for her and they

18:29.760 --> 18:33.520
just want to run with it. So maybe with one day the hope that she can end up reaching

18:33.520 --> 18:37.360
that state of peace and happiness, but the truth is it doesn't work like that, for all

18:37.360 --> 18:41.840
the realism that Lil Tay may have her vision of the future is rooted in some fantastical

18:41.840 --> 18:46.420
expectations that I do not believe can be fulfilled. Lil Tay clearly hates to receive

18:46.420 --> 18:51.100
hatred and negative reception, she's disabled ratings on her content and as she rallies

18:51.100 --> 18:54.820
against them she'll become more aggressive, trying to thicken that skin of her persona,

18:54.820 --> 18:58.520
trying to play it off with the hunnid on her wrist, but as soon as she wants to snap out

18:58.520 --> 19:02.100
of it to be that positive person that she briefly shows in her videos, she'll lose

19:02.100 --> 19:06.140
the appeal that she had anyway. The other option is to continue to be loud, obnoxious

19:06.140 --> 19:10.240
and unpleasant, but I don't think that's what she truly wants, just my forecast and

19:10.240 --> 19:14.740
even then that will fade, it all fades when you behave like that. Lil Tay is fragile,

19:14.740 --> 19:18.460
at the end of the day she's a kid, she's 9 years old, who is in way over her head,

19:18.460 --> 19:22.040
and I hope she gets out of it in one. She and others want to tell themselves that they

19:22.040 --> 19:26.980
can be this mature, independent baller, but like many others the superficiality masquerades

19:26.980 --> 19:31.060
genuine pain that should be addressed. It's not healthy, it won't last, regardless of

19:31.060 --> 19:35.200
how much money she makes, whoever's in charge should take a serious look at themselves and

19:35.200 --> 19:44.460
ask if the legacy will be worth it. I hope, for everyone's sake, that it is.

19:44.460 --> 19:48.260
What are your thoughts on the situation? Should Lil Tay escape the flexing persona,

19:48.260 --> 19:52.480
and if so how? And how do we feel about other people who may be playing a role in this?

19:52.480 --> 19:56.180
I would love to hear down below. I'd like to give huge thanks to the editors on this
