00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:24,900
Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with

2
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:29,320
too much free time, and Lil Tay. I don't normally go into such topics, I think it's best to

3
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:33,080
leave the reaction commentator to their own devices, but every now and then something

4
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:38,160
deeply disconcerting comes along, something that drives me to action, and today that person

5
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,240
is Lil Tay. Lil Tay is a child, 9 years old to be specific, she likes to make that very

6
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:57,440
clear in her videos, in case you hadn't fucking noticed.

7
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,920
She's an instagram star and basically posts a lot of videos of her gloating over her fortune,

8
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,400
and boy, everyone just eats that shit up. She socialises with rap virtuosos such as

9
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,060
Chief Keef. In case you didn't know, Lil Tay has a load of houses, and a load of cars,

10
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:15,800
and a load of money. More money than you, the viewer, yes, she be flexing, constantly

11
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,860
there to remind you of how inadequate your own life is.

12
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:22,840
On the surface it seems like another embarrassing new low for social media, but when I sat down

13
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:26,360
to think about it, many questions came into my head, many things that I couldn't shake,

14
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:29,480
things that I had to find out for myself, most people just point and laugh at their

15
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:32,920
antics, but that's underselling what's going on here, isn't it?

16
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:37,080
Today I will tell you a different story, maybe one of tragedy, maybe one of exploitation,

17
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:41,100
that many men dare not to go. When I started this script it was a simple concept, observe

18
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:45,060
and dissect the Lil Tay situation, however as I researched more and more, the truth became

19
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:48,760
warringly clear to me. Am I going mad? There is a 9 year old behaving like a stripper who

20
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:53,940
just cashed her first paycheck and people are going, huh, that's weird. You know what,

21
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:57,900
it is fucking weird. And today we're going to go into Lil Tay's mind.

22
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:05,340
Back a few months ago I did a video covering Wobe Vicky and Martina Big, basically explaining

23
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:09,540
why being transracial makes no sense, and much less sense in comparison to being something

24
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:13,260
like transgender. I gave Victoria here quite a roasting, and to be honest, she deserved

25
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:16,940
it. However that did not dissuade her, and 8 months on she's still wreaking havoc on

26
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:19,940
the world as we know it. I hoped it was a fad that would fade into irrelevance, but

27
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:24,140
given the fact that her and Danielle Bregoli have become the darlings of reaction commentary,

28
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,700
they have only grown in prominence.

29
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:29,660
Speaking of Danielle Bregoli, that is someone else I also covered, albeit briefly in my

30
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:33,780
video The Dr Phil Problem, in which I laid out the problem of using children's legitimate

31
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:37,940
problems for entertainment and posed the question asking if this is really good for them, and

32
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:41,460
like Wobe Vicky, she has continued to cause a nuisance wherever she decided to drag her

33
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:45,100
exasperating persona. Now I really should have put two and two together and realised

34
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:48,400
that these two young bucks were on a collision course, but honestly I just wanted to block

35
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,200
it out of my mind and never speak of these simpletons again. The gods however have no

36
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:56,720
mercy on my soul, and in April 2018, Wobe Vicky and Danielle Bregoli decided to have

37
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:01,080
a good bout of fisticuffs. This meant multiple orgasms from the reaction commentators who

38
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,880
couldn't reach for their microphones fast enough. These two females are desperate for

39
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:08,640
attention, and they will continue to get it, and you know what, I do not blame the people

40
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,120
who give them it. At the end of the day, reaction commentators, news channels, they gotta cover

41
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,480
what's interesting, and what people want to hear, and if they don't cover it, someone

42
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,440
else will. That's the name of the game, and really, although they played a component

43
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:22,240
in promoting the ridiculous behaviour, there's nothing new about that, they're just a response

44
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:26,360
rather than a cause. In making a video I have to accept that I might give them attention

45
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:29,760
too, I just have to try and make sure it's not the sort that they desire. The thing about

46
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,400
the culture that people like Wobe Vicky and Danielle Bregoli have created is nothing short

47
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:37,360
of a simple shock value concept, essentially human clickbait. If you were to have never

48
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,120
heard of these people, you would inevitably be as intrigued as you would be disturbed.

49
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,560
How can someone like Wobe Vicky claim to be black? How can Danielle Bregoli be so trashy

50
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:50,200
at her age? These are simple questions, but questions that draw in an audience. However,

51
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:53,700
when these simple questions are answered, people begin to lose interest, and therefore

52
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:57,280
these characters create new questions, and new ways to shock their audience that will

53
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,780
keep them invested. This has definitely been aided by commentators who find new ways to

54
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:04,640
spin these people's existence, whether it's finding out what Wobe Vicky sounds like normally,

55
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,560
or whether it's the influx of Danielle Bregoli clones that fuel the juicy titles for these

56
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,960
creators. These sorts of people are on a lifespan of fame, therefore it is necessary

57
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:16,520
that they slowly escalate their antics, and Wobe Vicky and Danielle Bregoli's fight

58
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:20,880
appears to be a climax in both their careers, however if you can't top that then your

59
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,080
career may quickly nosedive, and you'll be running on empty in no time at all. And

60
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:29,600
this is where Lil Tay comes into it. Squaring off with someone 6 years older than you may

61
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,860
sound like a fucking stupid idea, but not to Lil Tay apparently, who used it as an easy

62
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:38,740
way to platformer antics, and suddenly everyone was fascinated with this child. Why? How did

63
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:42,380
we let this happen? Well, my last segment wasn't just meaningless waffle, it actually

64
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:46,100
intertwines perfectly with what I'm about to state. What interested everyone initially

65
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:49,780
about the girls aforementioned is that they shocked us, particularly with their audacity

66
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:53,940
for such an apparent immaturity. However, as people become desensitized to that behaviour,

67
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:57,620
it will no longer shock them, it will become normal in a way. One thing that Bregoli and

68
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:02,260
Vicky cannot change are their ages, and have you ever wondered why Lil Tay states her age

69
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:06,940
so often? Yes. A first Lil Tay stating her age may seem like a way to emphasise how

70
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:11,500
successful she is in comparison to your elderly broke ass, proof that there is no justice

71
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:15,380
in this world. But I propose that what she is actually doing, or what she is being prompted

72
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:19,500
to do, is a marketing technique to ingrain the fact of her age into the viewer's head.

73
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:23,300
It's shock value, and it's working in absolute rights. One piece of evidence of this act

74
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:27,720
can be shown in her video where she visits Jake Paul, another role model of the internet.

75
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:31,800
The video seems incredibly scripted, and Jake Paul himself at points seems prompted to bring

76
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,520
up her relative age, as if it's meant to wow the viewers. Jake Paul, dressed in his

77
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:40,440
virgin nonce-proof outfit, even says in his most convinced tone that now he thinks about

78
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,760
it, it's super crazy that she's 9 years old.

79
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:55,880
This is some of the most obvious subliminal marketing I've seen in a while. It mostly

80
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:00,200
sounds like a broken record repeating the same phrases again and again, just bashing

81
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:04,480
in the two simple facts, that she's 9, and she doesn't behave like she's 9. She's

82
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:08,600
antithetic to what a 9 year old should behave like, there's your persona. Find what the

83
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:12,920
stereotype of yourself is, and go with the opposite. Job done, you have your 15 or even

84
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:16,940
5 minutes of fame. It's important to note that Lil Tay still has plenty of leeway on

85
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:21,480
YouTube as she hasn't really uploaded content, and most of it is on Instagram, on an account

86
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:25,960
that is managed by Miranda Cosgrove of all people. I'm not sure if this is a joke,

87
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:29,600
but I noticed that she ripped a quote from a Joe Wolfe song for her bio. Though she doesn't

88
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:33,280
come across to me as a classic rock person, what do I know, it's a bizarre timeline

89
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,280
after all. The other appeal that Lil Tay has is the obvious, the one that we don't really

90
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,960
need to touch on too much because it's basically been gone over before, money. Certain people

91
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:45,480
have a great preoccupation with regards to how other people spend their money, and Lil

92
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:49,520
Tay is no exception. Being able to flex is obviously going to attract her people who

93
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,240
want to observe the life that she's living, and almost put themselves in her position

94
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:57,040
in a way to recapture it. This is certainly not what appeals to me, but it's a common

95
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:01,760
internet trait, being rich definitely helps your cause. Lil Tay is another step in a direction

96
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:05,920
that only seems appropriate for 2018, and will be used to try and vulture into some

97
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:09,800
sort of mainstream clique. Whether it's a step too far for many networks is another

98
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:13,120
question, but I doubt that many companies will flinch at the opportunity to make money,

99
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,240
regardless of the moral questions, which strangely enough no one seems to be asking. But let's

100
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:21,240
ask some more questions, and see if we can deduce any reasonable answers.

101
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:41,720
I think the first thing is, why haven't we been more critical of her age? And this isn't

102
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:45,520
necessarily to imply that people have ignored it, but it's more been a bit of a joke, and

103
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,560
that's fine, nothing's wrong with a bit of banter with the lads. But it does seem suspicious

104
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:53,840
and not something that we should be endorsing, the only real issue is that we don't challenge

105
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,480
it because we don't see who is managing her, we don't see who is in charge. This brings

106
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:01,280
me back to an earlier point as well, she acts completely antithetically to how a 9 year

107
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:05,520
old should behave. This creates a seemingly paradoxical situation, where people are shocked

108
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,440
by the fact that she is 9 years old, but then go on to judge her on the basis of her actions

109
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,180
as if she were an adult. Just look at the comments, it also doesn't help that social

110
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:17,340
media acts as a communicative block to the facts that would appear quite clearly if we

111
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:21,500
were to re-enact these situations in real life. Chief Keef is standing with a 9 year

112
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,820
old, I'm fairly libertarian when it comes to children's prerogatives, but that's pushing

113
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:29,520
it a bit, isn't it? This also brings us to our next point, the environment. In the commentary

114
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,860
community there is a host of ages, typically ranging from approximately 13 to 40. Now obviously

115
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:37,220
there are some barriers within that, but if I were to present you with that scenario in

116
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:40,740
the real world you'd probably do a double take. However given the fact that there is

117
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:44,900
a behavioural continuity, it often doesn't feel like that, some kids are more mature

118
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:49,300
than the adults, people are united by the environment so nothing seems out of order.

119
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:53,540
Lillte utilises these points, firstly she is placed in strictly adult situations and

120
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:57,580
therefore although her age may stand out it doesn't create an alarm, because her behaviour

121
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:01,580
although definitely immature is well acclimatised to these scenarios, it's not like Danielle

122
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:05,260
Bregoli has walked into a nursery and tried to smack a bitch up, though I wouldn't put

123
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:09,160
it past her, we'll see how desperate she gets. Secondly, everything is sold through

124
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:12,840
the screen, therefore they have complete domain to be as selective with what they want

125
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:16,760
to show, allowing them to completely sell the side of Lillte they want to. As I will

126
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:20,680
come to soon, it appears there is a lot more going on behind the scenes, but we don't think

127
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:24,480
to question it because the burden of proof would lie on us, and many people aren't willing

128
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,680
to go that extra step. Does that make it right? Hell no, I do not think any 9 year old should

129
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,680
be placed in that position, although I do think some children more well equipped to

130
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,600
fame than others. I think such a culture at the age of 9 is incredibly irresponsible,

131
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,900
that even if they demonstrate some level of shrewdness, it doesn't reflect a general

132
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:43,480
capability beyond being directed to behave like that. I will expand on why I believe

133
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:47,360
this to be an extremely fragile situation in a bit, but first we need to ask who is

134
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,360
behind all this.

135
00:09:48,360 --> 00:10:00,680
There have been many questions bouncing around about whose responsibility it is, because

136
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:04,080
although I would like to think that Lillte is just cruising around the block in a Bentley,

137
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,420
I don't think that she'd get very far if she tried to. Obviously, there is someone

138
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:10,780
arranging all of this, I don't think it's Miranda Cosgrove strangely enough, I do not

139
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:14,600
believe hers is the main influence of this story. Let's dig a bit deeper. In one Instagram

140
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:18,060
post that seems to be staged to the point of parody, she assaults someone riding a scooter

141
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:51,900
However the discussion was very quickly switched to the person riding the scooter, who seemed

142
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:56,300
to be an older man of Asian heritage. Many have conspired that it may be in fact a relative

143
00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:00,260
to Lillte, although it's unlikely to be her father whom Lillte claims to have left

144
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:04,960
when she was very young. It's left very ambiguous, and they could just be baiting

145
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:08,500
more discussion spurned from the mystery of Lillte's existence, she just appeared to

146
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:12,020
have materialised out of nowhere, and now we're just rolling with it. However the

147
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:14,660
clips to me are red herrings, and I'll explain why very soon.

148
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:19,620
Doesn't it all seem a bit surreal? I mean my theory would typically be that the people involved have basically turned

149
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:23,740
Lillte into a cash machine, but that seems strange given the fact that her family appeared

150
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:27,860
to already be loaded. I don't think someone seriously buys the fact that this is Lillte's

151
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:31,540
own money unless she put her fucking piggy bank into bitcoin while she was still in the

152
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:36,460
womb. What has been given away by a few clips to me is that Lillte isn't just an actor,

153
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:39,780
this doesn't seem completely forced, there seems to be some investment from her. Which

154
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:43,900
is quite astounding, there does seem to be an element of realism, now of course it is

155
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:47,780
to be taken with a pinch of salt, we cannot necessarily completely dissect the mentality,

156
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:53,180
but it doesn't appear to me as if it's a 100% puppet show. I say 100% because it's

157
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:57,020
clear to me from her limited vocabulary and explanations she's being somewhat prompted,

158
00:11:57,020 --> 00:12:00,660
either from those around her, or maybe just the culture that she's immersed in, maybe

159
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:05,140
she literally got it from TV references. Regardless there does seem to be some sort of mutual

160
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:09,180
enterprise, Lillte is clearly trying very hard to understand how to behave in these

161
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:13,340
situations. Lillte claims that her father left when she was very young, generally children

162
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:17,220
raised by a single parent may have to end up being a lot more self-sufficient, so it

163
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:21,100
wouldn't necessarily surprise me if Lillte has at least a stake in this herself, even

164
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:25,180
if someone else is pulling the strings. So with all this information in mind, instinctively

165
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:29,340
people may point towards her mother, however a couple of videos are pointing towards someone

166
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:33,660
who may be her brother. Here's a video of him prompting Lillte during the Bregoli confrontation.

167
00:12:43,340 --> 00:13:12,420
I'm not saying anything certain, but this seems very suspicious, and if true demonstrates

168
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:16,300
to me that there are some rather exploitive practices occurring. Some claim the person

169
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:20,940
in this clip to be icy ricey, another content creator who hastily deleted his content very

170
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:25,720
recently and was also a massive rice gun fan, and also has a link to an inactive Instagram

171
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:30,380
account in which he claims to be quote Lillte's sister. So if you want my prediction, he's

172
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:35,260
our guy, and he knows what he's doing. Lillte's comprehension in what she's doing seems to

173
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:39,780
be this elementary understanding on her behalf rather than the full investment in the reasoning

174
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:43,500
of what comprises a culture, and that makes complete sense, at 9 years old the way you

175
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:47,300
understand the environments around you is not as developed as it is when you hit your

176
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:51,220
teenage years, and although she's clearly no idiot, and much sharper than the average

177
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:55,780
9 year old, it demonstrates what needs to be known about her suitability for such environments.

178
00:13:55,780 --> 00:14:00,980
Not suitable enough. It seems less of a situation where a relative is simply trying to use their

179
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:05,180
child as an actor to live out their dreams, and more a twisted westernised Asian dad meme

180
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:09,020
with facilitation where necessary, and whereas pushing for strong grades is certainly one

181
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:12,500
thing, a child being thrown in the public spotlight with something that they may not

182
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:16,580
truly understand is walking a tightrope, and I think it's important to discuss the tightrope

183
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:17,940
that Lillte is walking.

184
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:31,100
I want to show you a video. This is a video that has been picked up by a few as a sort

185
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:35,220
of true insight into Lillte's behaviour, and how she feels, however most of them haven't

186
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:38,980
really looked beyond that, and I think it's a much more important clip to this story than

187
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:39,780
many let on.

188
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:57,500
The emotional state is the first thing to notice, to Lillte's credit she has somewhat

189
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:01,740
thick skin, but even this can go too far. Immediately you're struck by the voice cracks

190
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:06,060
tone and the fragility that this conveys, this is much more likened to a 9 year olds

191
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:09,740
behaviour. The next thing to notice is the change in usage of reference to her age, whereas

192
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:14,500
before it was used as a tool to flex and shock, this time it's used to emphasise her vulnerability,

193
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:18,100
much more expectant of someone who behaves like that. You can see she's trying to hold

194
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:21,580
it back, you can see she's trying to repress, there's a lot of withheld emotion, you can

195
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:25,060
observe this in the colouration of her face, the instability of her lower lip, and the

196
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:28,820
very panicked breaths interspersed. This is not someone who is ready for the lifestyle

197
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:32,900
that she is currently pursuing, or she is currently being told to pursue. Lillte states

198
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:36,980
she loves her mother, it's clear in a way that that familial connection is vital to

199
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:40,580
her, she is human, and although she's still trying to chuck in the dialect, the yarls,

200
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:44,660
the attitude, it's all immersed. And then there's a breakdown at the end, and it is

201
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:45,460
fucking sad.

202
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:52,780
And you want to know what this tells me. This tells me that Lillte is an emotionally fragile

203
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:57,100
human being, but she's facading it with a lot of persona, maybe prompted persona, maybe

204
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:01,140
her own persona, but she's repressing what it is like to be in her position, the actual

205
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:05,820
turmoil going through her head. And you know who that exactly resembles? Danielle Bregoli.

206
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:09,660
It's funny that they hate each other, yet they seem to be despicably alike. The issue

207
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:13,580
is that pain has never left, you search for that resolve, that end of the upset, and it

208
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:17,420
will never materialise itself if you continue to repress it. There are many things that

209
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:20,780
I have repressed, and the longer you do it, the further down the slope you slide. All

210
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:25,040
these unresolved emotions that you want to forever avoid, but you cannot. You can only

211
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:29,420
bottle it up so much for so long. Whether Lillte was trying to fill the shoes of someone

212
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:33,240
who was never there, whether she behaves like this to ward off people who may try to inflict

213
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:37,320
pain, or whether she's just trying to fulfil her family's wishes. That is something that

214
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:42,320
I cannot decide today. But Lillte is not just some spoiled, fratty kid. And it's kind of

215
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,480
weird to say that because it's what you immediately go with on first impressions. She's loud,

216
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,360
she's obnoxious, she's confrontational, she's everything that you imagine that stereotype

217
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:54,800
to be. But all it takes is one break of character, and something else reveals itself. Lillte's

218
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,560
behaviour is an act. I certainly don't think she is ready to be in the public spotlight,

219
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:02,400
and I certainly do not think that this will end well. Plenty of child stars hit the hard

220
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:06,520
concrete of reality eventually, and people with less of an occupation than her have hit

221
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:10,540
it harder. And when you build your own fame off something that seems inherently unsustainable

222
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:14,160
you are just postponing the inevitable. That is the bitter truth. And while the person

223
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,000
who appears to be pulling the strings will probably emerge completely untouched by this,

224
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,360
he will take the profit and she will take the scars. The person involved who seems to

225
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:25,120
be her brother may be the catalyst of this predicament, and if so I find his actions

226
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:28,560
to be the most irresponsible. He looks old enough to be aware of the scale of what he

227
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:32,720
is doing, however maybe not wise enough to realise the possible implications. Only time

228
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,300
will tell. Either way the more I think about the fact that she might be used publicly as

229
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:40,660
a controversy magnet makes me very annoyed, as this guy seems to have avoided the public

230
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:45,100
eye altogether while using her to sponge up a hell of a lot of vitriol that many children

231
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:49,880
her age would not be able to handle at all. We as humans are fascinated with the exceptional,

232
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:53,840
we love to see humanity go one step further with its craziness every time, and make no

233
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:58,820
mistake Lil Tay is exceptional, there is no doubt about it. There are clearly many circumstances

234
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:02,360
that have allowed her to thrive, and upon a time where it appears that we look for something

235
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:06,260
even more absurd than what we found in where Vicky and Danielle were going we discovered

236
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:10,200
what the people craved. But I do not believe that it is good for her, I do not believe

237
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:14,360
that she is just some vapid brat, I believe that there is someone who desperately needs

238
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:18,160
the right kind of help, but with the current success that her persona provides it will

239
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:22,640
be seldom found. Her endgame is diametrically opposed with how she wants to get there, I

240
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,960
have no doubt that she wants to do nice things, she'd love to be friendly, she's probably

241
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:29,760
tried being friendly in the past but now they've found a formula that works for her and they

242
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,520
just want to run with it. So maybe with one day the hope that she can end up reaching

243
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:37,360
that state of peace and happiness, but the truth is it doesn't work like that, for all

244
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:41,840
the realism that Lil Tay may have her vision of the future is rooted in some fantastical

245
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:46,420
expectations that I do not believe can be fulfilled. Lil Tay clearly hates to receive

246
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:51,100
hatred and negative reception, she's disabled ratings on her content and as she rallies

247
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:54,820
against them she'll become more aggressive, trying to thicken that skin of her persona,

248
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:58,520
trying to play it off with the hunnid on her wrist, but as soon as she wants to snap out

249
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:02,100
of it to be that positive person that she briefly shows in her videos, she'll lose

250
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:06,140
the appeal that she had anyway. The other option is to continue to be loud, obnoxious

251
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:10,240
and unpleasant, but I don't think that's what she truly wants, just my forecast and

252
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:14,740
even then that will fade, it all fades when you behave like that. Lil Tay is fragile,

253
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:18,460
at the end of the day she's a kid, she's 9 years old, who is in way over her head,

254
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:22,040
and I hope she gets out of it in one. She and others want to tell themselves that they

255
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:26,980
can be this mature, independent baller, but like many others the superficiality masquerades

256
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:31,060
genuine pain that should be addressed. It's not healthy, it won't last, regardless of

257
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:35,200
how much money she makes, whoever's in charge should take a serious look at themselves and

258
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:44,460
ask if the legacy will be worth it. I hope, for everyone's sake, that it is.

259
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:48,260
What are your thoughts on the situation? Should Lil Tay escape the flexing persona,

260
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:52,480
and if so how? And how do we feel about other people who may be playing a role in this?

261
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:56,180
I would love to hear down below. I'd like to give huge thanks to the editors on this
