0	24900	Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with
24900	29320	too much free time, and Lil Tay. I don't normally go into such topics, I think it's best to
29320	33080	leave the reaction commentator to their own devices, but every now and then something
33080	38160	deeply disconcerting comes along, something that drives me to action, and today that person
38160	43240	is Lil Tay. Lil Tay is a child, 9 years old to be specific, she likes to make that very
43240	57440	clear in her videos, in case you hadn't fucking noticed.
57440	61920	She's an instagram star and basically posts a lot of videos of her gloating over her fortune,
61920	66400	and boy, everyone just eats that shit up. She socialises with rap virtuosos such as
66400	71060	Chief Keef. In case you didn't know, Lil Tay has a load of houses, and a load of cars,
71060	75800	and a load of money. More money than you, the viewer, yes, she be flexing, constantly
75800	78860	there to remind you of how inadequate your own life is.
78860	82840	On the surface it seems like another embarrassing new low for social media, but when I sat down
82840	86360	to think about it, many questions came into my head, many things that I couldn't shake,
86360	89480	things that I had to find out for myself, most people just point and laugh at their
89480	92920	antics, but that's underselling what's going on here, isn't it?
92920	97080	Today I will tell you a different story, maybe one of tragedy, maybe one of exploitation,
97080	101100	that many men dare not to go. When I started this script it was a simple concept, observe
101100	105060	and dissect the Lil Tay situation, however as I researched more and more, the truth became
105060	108760	warringly clear to me. Am I going mad? There is a 9 year old behaving like a stripper who
108760	113940	just cashed her first paycheck and people are going, huh, that's weird. You know what,
113940	117900	it is fucking weird. And today we're going to go into Lil Tay's mind.
117900	125340	Back a few months ago I did a video covering Wobe Vicky and Martina Big, basically explaining
125340	129540	why being transracial makes no sense, and much less sense in comparison to being something
129540	133260	like transgender. I gave Victoria here quite a roasting, and to be honest, she deserved
133260	136940	it. However that did not dissuade her, and 8 months on she's still wreaking havoc on
136940	139940	the world as we know it. I hoped it was a fad that would fade into irrelevance, but
139940	144140	given the fact that her and Danielle Bregoli have become the darlings of reaction commentary,
144140	145700	they have only grown in prominence.
145700	149660	Speaking of Danielle Bregoli, that is someone else I also covered, albeit briefly in my
149660	153780	video The Dr Phil Problem, in which I laid out the problem of using children's legitimate
153780	157940	problems for entertainment and posed the question asking if this is really good for them, and
157940	161460	like Wobe Vicky, she has continued to cause a nuisance wherever she decided to drag her
161460	165100	exasperating persona. Now I really should have put two and two together and realised
165100	168400	that these two young bucks were on a collision course, but honestly I just wanted to block
168400	172200	it out of my mind and never speak of these simpletons again. The gods however have no
172200	176720	mercy on my soul, and in April 2018, Wobe Vicky and Danielle Bregoli decided to have
176720	181080	a good bout of fisticuffs. This meant multiple orgasms from the reaction commentators who
181080	184880	couldn't reach for their microphones fast enough. These two females are desperate for
184880	188640	attention, and they will continue to get it, and you know what, I do not blame the people
188640	192120	who give them it. At the end of the day, reaction commentators, news channels, they gotta cover
192120	195480	what's interesting, and what people want to hear, and if they don't cover it, someone
195480	198440	else will. That's the name of the game, and really, although they played a component
198440	202240	in promoting the ridiculous behaviour, there's nothing new about that, they're just a response
202240	206360	rather than a cause. In making a video I have to accept that I might give them attention
206360	209760	too, I just have to try and make sure it's not the sort that they desire. The thing about
209760	213400	the culture that people like Wobe Vicky and Danielle Bregoli have created is nothing short
213400	217360	of a simple shock value concept, essentially human clickbait. If you were to have never
217360	221120	heard of these people, you would inevitably be as intrigued as you would be disturbed.
221120	225560	How can someone like Wobe Vicky claim to be black? How can Danielle Bregoli be so trashy
225560	230200	at her age? These are simple questions, but questions that draw in an audience. However,
230200	233700	when these simple questions are answered, people begin to lose interest, and therefore
233700	237280	these characters create new questions, and new ways to shock their audience that will
237280	240780	keep them invested. This has definitely been aided by commentators who find new ways to
240780	244640	spin these people's existence, whether it's finding out what Wobe Vicky sounds like normally,
244640	248560	or whether it's the influx of Danielle Bregoli clones that fuel the juicy titles for these
248560	252960	creators. These sorts of people are on a lifespan of fame, therefore it is necessary
252960	256520	that they slowly escalate their antics, and Wobe Vicky and Danielle Bregoli's fight
256520	260880	appears to be a climax in both their careers, however if you can't top that then your
260880	265080	career may quickly nosedive, and you'll be running on empty in no time at all. And
265080	269600	this is where Lil Tay comes into it. Squaring off with someone 6 years older than you may
269600	273860	sound like a fucking stupid idea, but not to Lil Tay apparently, who used it as an easy
273860	278740	way to platformer antics, and suddenly everyone was fascinated with this child. Why? How did
278740	282380	we let this happen? Well, my last segment wasn't just meaningless waffle, it actually
282380	286100	intertwines perfectly with what I'm about to state. What interested everyone initially
286100	289780	about the girls aforementioned is that they shocked us, particularly with their audacity
289780	293940	for such an apparent immaturity. However, as people become desensitized to that behaviour,
293940	297620	it will no longer shock them, it will become normal in a way. One thing that Bregoli and
297620	302260	Vicky cannot change are their ages, and have you ever wondered why Lil Tay states her age
302260	306940	so often? Yes. A first Lil Tay stating her age may seem like a way to emphasise how
306940	311500	successful she is in comparison to your elderly broke ass, proof that there is no justice
311500	315380	in this world. But I propose that what she is actually doing, or what she is being prompted
315380	319500	to do, is a marketing technique to ingrain the fact of her age into the viewer's head.
319500	323300	It's shock value, and it's working in absolute rights. One piece of evidence of this act
323300	327720	can be shown in her video where she visits Jake Paul, another role model of the internet.
327720	331800	The video seems incredibly scripted, and Jake Paul himself at points seems prompted to bring
331840	335520	up her relative age, as if it's meant to wow the viewers. Jake Paul, dressed in his
335520	340440	virgin nonce-proof outfit, even says in his most convinced tone that now he thinks about
340440	342760	it, it's super crazy that she's 9 years old.
352280	355880	This is some of the most obvious subliminal marketing I've seen in a while. It mostly
355880	360200	sounds like a broken record repeating the same phrases again and again, just bashing
360200	364480	in the two simple facts, that she's 9, and she doesn't behave like she's 9. She's
364480	368600	antithetic to what a 9 year old should behave like, there's your persona. Find what the
368600	372920	stereotype of yourself is, and go with the opposite. Job done, you have your 15 or even
372920	376940	5 minutes of fame. It's important to note that Lil Tay still has plenty of leeway on
376940	381480	YouTube as she hasn't really uploaded content, and most of it is on Instagram, on an account
381480	385960	that is managed by Miranda Cosgrove of all people. I'm not sure if this is a joke,
385960	389600	but I noticed that she ripped a quote from a Joe Wolfe song for her bio. Though she doesn't
389640	393280	come across to me as a classic rock person, what do I know, it's a bizarre timeline
393280	397280	after all. The other appeal that Lil Tay has is the obvious, the one that we don't really
397280	401960	need to touch on too much because it's basically been gone over before, money. Certain people
401960	405480	have a great preoccupation with regards to how other people spend their money, and Lil
405480	409520	Tay is no exception. Being able to flex is obviously going to attract her people who
409520	413240	want to observe the life that she's living, and almost put themselves in her position
413240	417040	in a way to recapture it. This is certainly not what appeals to me, but it's a common
417040	421760	internet trait, being rich definitely helps your cause. Lil Tay is another step in a direction
421760	425920	that only seems appropriate for 2018, and will be used to try and vulture into some
425920	429800	sort of mainstream clique. Whether it's a step too far for many networks is another
429800	433120	question, but I doubt that many companies will flinch at the opportunity to make money,
433120	437240	regardless of the moral questions, which strangely enough no one seems to be asking. But let's
437240	441240	ask some more questions, and see if we can deduce any reasonable answers.
457240	461720	I think the first thing is, why haven't we been more critical of her age? And this isn't
461720	465520	necessarily to imply that people have ignored it, but it's more been a bit of a joke, and
465520	469560	that's fine, nothing's wrong with a bit of banter with the lads. But it does seem suspicious
469560	473840	and not something that we should be endorsing, the only real issue is that we don't challenge
473840	477480	it because we don't see who is managing her, we don't see who is in charge. This brings
477480	481280	me back to an earlier point as well, she acts completely antithetically to how a 9 year
481280	485520	old should behave. This creates a seemingly paradoxical situation, where people are shocked
485520	489440	by the fact that she is 9 years old, but then go on to judge her on the basis of her actions
489440	493180	as if she were an adult. Just look at the comments, it also doesn't help that social
493180	497340	media acts as a communicative block to the facts that would appear quite clearly if we
497340	501500	were to re-enact these situations in real life. Chief Keef is standing with a 9 year
501500	504820	old, I'm fairly libertarian when it comes to children's prerogatives, but that's pushing
504820	509520	it a bit, isn't it? This also brings us to our next point, the environment. In the commentary
509520	513860	community there is a host of ages, typically ranging from approximately 13 to 40. Now obviously
513860	517220	there are some barriers within that, but if I were to present you with that scenario in
517220	520740	the real world you'd probably do a double take. However given the fact that there is
520740	524900	a behavioural continuity, it often doesn't feel like that, some kids are more mature
524900	529300	than the adults, people are united by the environment so nothing seems out of order.
529300	533540	Lillte utilises these points, firstly she is placed in strictly adult situations and
533540	537580	therefore although her age may stand out it doesn't create an alarm, because her behaviour
537580	541580	although definitely immature is well acclimatised to these scenarios, it's not like Danielle
541580	545260	Bregoli has walked into a nursery and tried to smack a bitch up, though I wouldn't put
545260	549160	it past her, we'll see how desperate she gets. Secondly, everything is sold through
549160	552840	the screen, therefore they have complete domain to be as selective with what they want
552840	556760	to show, allowing them to completely sell the side of Lillte they want to. As I will
556760	560680	come to soon, it appears there is a lot more going on behind the scenes, but we don't think
560680	564480	to question it because the burden of proof would lie on us, and many people aren't willing
564480	568680	to go that extra step. Does that make it right? Hell no, I do not think any 9 year old should
568680	571680	be placed in that position, although I do think some children more well equipped to
571680	575600	fame than others. I think such a culture at the age of 9 is incredibly irresponsible,
575600	578900	that even if they demonstrate some level of shrewdness, it doesn't reflect a general
578900	583480	capability beyond being directed to behave like that. I will expand on why I believe
583480	587360	this to be an extremely fragile situation in a bit, but first we need to ask who is
587360	588360	behind all this.
588360	600680	There have been many questions bouncing around about whose responsibility it is, because
600680	604080	although I would like to think that Lillte is just cruising around the block in a Bentley,
604080	607420	I don't think that she'd get very far if she tried to. Obviously, there is someone
607420	610780	arranging all of this, I don't think it's Miranda Cosgrove strangely enough, I do not
610780	614600	believe hers is the main influence of this story. Let's dig a bit deeper. In one Instagram
614600	618060	post that seems to be staged to the point of parody, she assaults someone riding a scooter
648060	651900	However the discussion was very quickly switched to the person riding the scooter, who seemed
651900	656300	to be an older man of Asian heritage. Many have conspired that it may be in fact a relative
656300	660260	to Lillte, although it's unlikely to be her father whom Lillte claims to have left
660260	664960	when she was very young. It's left very ambiguous, and they could just be baiting
664960	668500	more discussion spurned from the mystery of Lillte's existence, she just appeared to
668500	672020	have materialised out of nowhere, and now we're just rolling with it. However the
672020	674660	clips to me are red herrings, and I'll explain why very soon.
674780	679620	Doesn't it all seem a bit surreal? I mean my theory would typically be that the people involved have basically turned
679620	683740	Lillte into a cash machine, but that seems strange given the fact that her family appeared
683740	687860	to already be loaded. I don't think someone seriously buys the fact that this is Lillte's
687860	691540	own money unless she put her fucking piggy bank into bitcoin while she was still in the
691540	696460	womb. What has been given away by a few clips to me is that Lillte isn't just an actor,
696460	699780	this doesn't seem completely forced, there seems to be some investment from her. Which
699780	703900	is quite astounding, there does seem to be an element of realism, now of course it is
703900	707780	to be taken with a pinch of salt, we cannot necessarily completely dissect the mentality,
707780	713180	but it doesn't appear to me as if it's a 100% puppet show. I say 100% because it's
713180	717020	clear to me from her limited vocabulary and explanations she's being somewhat prompted,
717020	720660	either from those around her, or maybe just the culture that she's immersed in, maybe
720660	725140	she literally got it from TV references. Regardless there does seem to be some sort of mutual
725140	729180	enterprise, Lillte is clearly trying very hard to understand how to behave in these
729180	733340	situations. Lillte claims that her father left when she was very young, generally children
733340	737220	raised by a single parent may have to end up being a lot more self-sufficient, so it
737220	741100	wouldn't necessarily surprise me if Lillte has at least a stake in this herself, even
741100	745180	if someone else is pulling the strings. So with all this information in mind, instinctively
745180	749340	people may point towards her mother, however a couple of videos are pointing towards someone
749340	753660	who may be her brother. Here's a video of him prompting Lillte during the Bregoli confrontation.
763340	792420	I'm not saying anything certain, but this seems very suspicious, and if true demonstrates
792420	796300	to me that there are some rather exploitive practices occurring. Some claim the person
796300	800940	in this clip to be icy ricey, another content creator who hastily deleted his content very
800940	805720	recently and was also a massive rice gun fan, and also has a link to an inactive Instagram
805720	810380	account in which he claims to be quote Lillte's sister. So if you want my prediction, he's
810380	815260	our guy, and he knows what he's doing. Lillte's comprehension in what she's doing seems to
815260	819780	be this elementary understanding on her behalf rather than the full investment in the reasoning
819780	823500	of what comprises a culture, and that makes complete sense, at 9 years old the way you
823500	827300	understand the environments around you is not as developed as it is when you hit your
827300	831220	teenage years, and although she's clearly no idiot, and much sharper than the average
831220	835780	9 year old, it demonstrates what needs to be known about her suitability for such environments.
835780	840980	Not suitable enough. It seems less of a situation where a relative is simply trying to use their
840980	845180	child as an actor to live out their dreams, and more a twisted westernised Asian dad meme
845180	849020	with facilitation where necessary, and whereas pushing for strong grades is certainly one
849020	852500	thing, a child being thrown in the public spotlight with something that they may not
852500	856580	truly understand is walking a tightrope, and I think it's important to discuss the tightrope
856580	857940	that Lillte is walking.
867220	871100	I want to show you a video. This is a video that has been picked up by a few as a sort
871100	875220	of true insight into Lillte's behaviour, and how she feels, however most of them haven't
875220	878980	really looked beyond that, and I think it's a much more important clip to this story than
878980	879780	many let on.
893780	897500	The emotional state is the first thing to notice, to Lillte's credit she has somewhat
897500	901740	thick skin, but even this can go too far. Immediately you're struck by the voice cracks
901740	906060	tone and the fragility that this conveys, this is much more likened to a 9 year olds
906060	909740	behaviour. The next thing to notice is the change in usage of reference to her age, whereas
909740	914500	before it was used as a tool to flex and shock, this time it's used to emphasise her vulnerability,
914500	918100	much more expectant of someone who behaves like that. You can see she's trying to hold
918100	921580	it back, you can see she's trying to repress, there's a lot of withheld emotion, you can
921580	925060	observe this in the colouration of her face, the instability of her lower lip, and the
925060	928820	very panicked breaths interspersed. This is not someone who is ready for the lifestyle
928860	932900	that she is currently pursuing, or she is currently being told to pursue. Lillte states
932900	936980	she loves her mother, it's clear in a way that that familial connection is vital to
936980	940580	her, she is human, and although she's still trying to chuck in the dialect, the yarls,
940580	944660	the attitude, it's all immersed. And then there's a breakdown at the end, and it is
944660	945460	fucking sad.
948740	952780	And you want to know what this tells me. This tells me that Lillte is an emotionally fragile
952780	957100	human being, but she's facading it with a lot of persona, maybe prompted persona, maybe
957100	961140	her own persona, but she's repressing what it is like to be in her position, the actual
961140	965820	turmoil going through her head. And you know who that exactly resembles? Danielle Bregoli.
965820	969660	It's funny that they hate each other, yet they seem to be despicably alike. The issue
969660	973580	is that pain has never left, you search for that resolve, that end of the upset, and it
973580	977420	will never materialise itself if you continue to repress it. There are many things that
977420	980780	I have repressed, and the longer you do it, the further down the slope you slide. All
980780	985040	these unresolved emotions that you want to forever avoid, but you cannot. You can only
985040	989420	bottle it up so much for so long. Whether Lillte was trying to fill the shoes of someone
989420	993240	who was never there, whether she behaves like this to ward off people who may try to inflict
993240	997320	pain, or whether she's just trying to fulfil her family's wishes. That is something that
997320	1002320	I cannot decide today. But Lillte is not just some spoiled, fratty kid. And it's kind of
1002320	1006480	weird to say that because it's what you immediately go with on first impressions. She's loud,
1006480	1010360	she's obnoxious, she's confrontational, she's everything that you imagine that stereotype
1010360	1014800	to be. But all it takes is one break of character, and something else reveals itself. Lillte's
1014800	1018560	behaviour is an act. I certainly don't think she is ready to be in the public spotlight,
1018560	1022400	and I certainly do not think that this will end well. Plenty of child stars hit the hard
1022400	1026520	concrete of reality eventually, and people with less of an occupation than her have hit
1026520	1030540	it harder. And when you build your own fame off something that seems inherently unsustainable
1030540	1034160	you are just postponing the inevitable. That is the bitter truth. And while the person
1034160	1038000	who appears to be pulling the strings will probably emerge completely untouched by this,
1038000	1041360	he will take the profit and she will take the scars. The person involved who seems to
1041360	1045120	be her brother may be the catalyst of this predicament, and if so I find his actions
1045120	1048560	to be the most irresponsible. He looks old enough to be aware of the scale of what he
1048560	1052720	is doing, however maybe not wise enough to realise the possible implications. Only time
1052720	1056300	will tell. Either way the more I think about the fact that she might be used publicly as
1056300	1060660	a controversy magnet makes me very annoyed, as this guy seems to have avoided the public
1060660	1065100	eye altogether while using her to sponge up a hell of a lot of vitriol that many children
1065100	1069880	her age would not be able to handle at all. We as humans are fascinated with the exceptional,
1069880	1073840	we love to see humanity go one step further with its craziness every time, and make no
1073840	1078820	mistake Lil Tay is exceptional, there is no doubt about it. There are clearly many circumstances
1078820	1082360	that have allowed her to thrive, and upon a time where it appears that we look for something
1082360	1086260	even more absurd than what we found in where Vicky and Danielle were going we discovered
1086260	1090200	what the people craved. But I do not believe that it is good for her, I do not believe
1090200	1094360	that she is just some vapid brat, I believe that there is someone who desperately needs
1094360	1098160	the right kind of help, but with the current success that her persona provides it will
1098160	1102640	be seldom found. Her endgame is diametrically opposed with how she wants to get there, I
1102640	1105960	have no doubt that she wants to do nice things, she'd love to be friendly, she's probably
1105960	1109760	tried being friendly in the past but now they've found a formula that works for her and they
1109760	1113520	just want to run with it. So maybe with one day the hope that she can end up reaching
1113520	1117360	that state of peace and happiness, but the truth is it doesn't work like that, for all
1117360	1121840	the realism that Lil Tay may have her vision of the future is rooted in some fantastical
1121840	1126420	expectations that I do not believe can be fulfilled. Lil Tay clearly hates to receive
1126420	1131100	hatred and negative reception, she's disabled ratings on her content and as she rallies
1131100	1134820	against them she'll become more aggressive, trying to thicken that skin of her persona,
1134820	1138520	trying to play it off with the hunnid on her wrist, but as soon as she wants to snap out
1138520	1142100	of it to be that positive person that she briefly shows in her videos, she'll lose
1142100	1146140	the appeal that she had anyway. The other option is to continue to be loud, obnoxious
1146140	1150240	and unpleasant, but I don't think that's what she truly wants, just my forecast and
1150240	1154740	even then that will fade, it all fades when you behave like that. Lil Tay is fragile,
1154740	1158460	at the end of the day she's a kid, she's 9 years old, who is in way over her head,
1158460	1162040	and I hope she gets out of it in one. She and others want to tell themselves that they
1162040	1166980	can be this mature, independent baller, but like many others the superficiality masquerades
1166980	1171060	genuine pain that should be addressed. It's not healthy, it won't last, regardless of
1171060	1175200	how much money she makes, whoever's in charge should take a serious look at themselves and
1175200	1184460	ask if the legacy will be worth it. I hope, for everyone's sake, that it is.
1184460	1188260	What are your thoughts on the situation? Should Lil Tay escape the flexing persona,
1188260	1192480	and if so how? And how do we feel about other people who may be playing a role in this?
1192480	1196180	I would love to hear down below. I'd like to give huge thanks to the editors on this
1196180	1200060	project, once again another fantastic job, and I will be leaving all their links in the
