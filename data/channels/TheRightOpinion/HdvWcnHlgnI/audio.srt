00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,640
Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time,

2
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:15,640
and today I've decided to cover a topic that I've always wanted to, and I feel that time is now,

3
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:20,640
because chances are, when this video comes out, I'll be away on holiday, and won't have the chance to cover any

4
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,640
topics that are necessarily trending, but I have to say, out of all the people I've covered on this channel,

5
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:31,840
I think there are few people more intriguing than the person I've decided to cover today, and that person is Matt Hoss.

6
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:36,840
And if you're wondering who he is, well, you shouldn't be, but he is infamous amongst the internet community

7
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:44,120
for suing Ethan and Hila Klein, aka H3H3 Productions, over a reaction video they made on their second channel,

8
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:50,360
known as The Big, The Bold, The Beautiful, in which they delivered their signature reaction style commentary.

9
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:55,160
When I was a very small commentator, I made a little video called Matt Hoss Could Win,

10
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:59,960
in which I expressed my feelings on the whole lawsuit, and how in fact he could be successful.

11
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:05,560
At the time, fair use was still a very untested concept, and there had been cases in the past where creators had

12
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:11,720
lost against claimants, so I was especially sceptical of how some out of touch court might handle the case.

13
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:17,360
I think it was a justified concern, and at the end of the video, your sister snapped and went off on a memorable rant

14
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,680
that today would make such a typically placid individual like myself cringe.

15
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:27,920
That video was really the first taste of any success I had, as it amassed approximately 50,000 views at the time,

16
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:33,080
and I was pretty excited, I mean, what would this spell for an aspiring commentator like myself?

17
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:37,760
Well, basically nothing for another year, as all my videos afterwards didn't do much,

18
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:44,880
but I guess today, like Chris Martin once said, we're going back to the start, because I do find Matt Hoss a fascinating bloke.

19
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:50,400
Matt Hoss' channel is known as The Matt Hoss Zone, he did used to have an Instagram, but that's gone,

20
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:54,920
and he's been relatively inactive on all platforms, bar the occasional appearance on Facebook,

21
00:01:54,920 --> 00:02:00,080
where he expresses his distaste of Donald Trump, and promises his inevitable return to the followers

22
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:03,640
who are eagerly awaiting another masterpiece from the Maestro himself.

23
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:10,240
As a creator, he is fairly established, running on the platform for a few years with a fairly respectable backlog of content.

24
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:16,440
His description reads, original comedy, action, horror, and fantasy short films, with electronic dance music,

25
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:22,080
for the mind of Matt Hossainzadeh, Hossainzadeh being his full last name, which you know, he has mercifully shortened,

26
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,440
so I appreciate that. It's probably going to knock around 10 minutes off this video.

27
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:32,680
The original comedy, action, horror, and fantasy short films were a mix of him picking up girls with his mad parkour,

28
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:40,640
with some vampires thrown in there, I mean, that's a simplification, but I think a lot of people tend to look at his content as Matt.

29
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:49,120
There is no other way to describe his channel other than, it's Matt Hoss, unfiltered Matt Hoss, like the room was unfiltered Tommy Wiseau,

30
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:55,120
but I'm not so sure about that. This is where H3 are introduced, most people know how the story goes,

31
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:01,280
that basically Matt filed a civil action against H3 under the premise that their use of content wasn't there,

32
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:06,200
and defamed his character. H3 disputed this, and this then escalated to the courts.

33
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:12,360
Fortunately, this time round, the judge then, Catherine Forrest, the absolute legend, ruled in favour of the Clines.

34
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:19,720
It was probably one of the most famous motions, and it was heartwarming to see an often divided community uniting for the cause of something

35
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:25,840
that transcended the differences. Matt Hoss, the man at the centre of this lawsuit, became the sort of Disney villain of YouTube.

36
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:31,920
He himself was a content creator, and thus the lawsuit felt very personal. I spoke about this in my Smosh video,

37
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:39,920
but often when businesses file lawsuits, there is a lack of accountability. We'll hate the business, but they have no personality to hone in on,

38
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:48,400
they have no face to lambast. Matt Hoss put himself at the front and centre of the controversy, and there were very few people who were willing to defend him,

39
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:55,280
he didn't set himself out there as a likeable character. He often came across as highly egocentric and narcissistic,

40
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:02,520
and people tended to hone in on this. People hated him for it, and when videos came out, they were very critical of Matt Hoss in the moment,

41
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:08,920
but no one really asked why he did it, and in a way, when the situation is transpiring, I wouldn't expect people to.

42
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:16,160
The stakes seemed very high, and theorising over motivations when they weren't exactly relevant to the outcome seemed unnecessary,

43
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:21,200
but I feel like now that time has passed and we're all on the tubes, chilling, like the fellow kids we are,

44
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:28,480
I feel like maybe we do have time for a discussion, because as said, I really do find the character of Hoss a very captivating one.

45
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:34,400
I think many people at the time just saw him as this delusional reactionary, completely high off his own hubris,

46
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:42,160
and with this image in his head that he was under personal attack. And you know, when you look at the evidence, it's 100% credible,

47
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:50,960
and one that I even may agree with to an extent, but I want to have a discussion because I think there was a level of calculation that many people do not pay attention to,

48
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:56,400
and I want to watch his videos so we can perhaps understand the mind and motivations of Matt Hoss.

49
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:02,080
I'm someone who likes to find rationale and logic in everything, and although I accept that it's not always the case,

50
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:09,520
it's hard to believe that in spite of these slightly blurred lines of fair use, that Matt Hoss would end up likely throwing copious amounts of money away

51
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:14,520
to protect some semblance of personal reputation which he tried to reflect in his rhetoric.

52
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:19,600
That makes very little sense to me, and I want to see if we can find an alternative explanation.

53
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:26,720
There are a lot of details pre and post Lawsuit that I think can perhaps present a case that is very different to the one we assume as truth,

54
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:33,920
and I hope maybe I can provide a new take to an old situation, but to do that we have to cut the crap and enter the Matt Hoss zone,

55
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:42,400
which is a zone like no other, so I suggest we light up the fuse, burn it up, because at The Right Opinion, we go hard, and never go home.

56
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,880
Ready, set, go.

57
00:05:49,600 --> 00:06:00,160
The Matt Hoss character is a very interesting one, and one that does seem to be pretty consistent throughout his content.

58
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:05,360
Apart from these social commentaries, which is another barrel of fish that we'll have to knock over in a bit,

59
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:12,320
what happens is that you have this protagonist, namely our hero, Daddy Matt here, bold guy typically,

60
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:16,320
and what we see is him swooping in on this girl, the alpha male that he is.

61
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:21,840
Often this girl will play hard to get, be difficult, and not comply with Hoss's obvious advances,

62
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,880
however you see Matt Hoss isn't easily defeated, and will persist until he has the female.

63
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:32,880
The first video that he has up is a video known as Flirt, he did have one up before that was called In Blood,

64
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:39,520
however it has been taken down, but one can assume that that was more of the horror themed content that he was looking at,

65
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:45,360
and Flirt is much more to a formula, Hoss moves in, girl says no, Matt Hoss translates as yes,

66
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,720
and goes at it until she gives in to his manly charms.

67
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:06,160
See, where me and H3 disagree is that I don't think Matt Hoss is some old school cringe tube,

68
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,480
I think he's one of those corners of the internet that people say they've been to once,

69
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:14,960
and come back from, and aren't really interested in checking it out a second time.

70
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:24,160
It seems like it once again appeals to a select set of people who are looking to fulfil their position of being able to place themselves as the protagonist,

71
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:29,040
and live out their dreams of picking up a girl by telling her that basically they want to vore them,

72
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,360
that's what this is, dressed up vore.

73
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:36,480
The thing is, that on one hand this presents the delusion that many people associated Hoss with,

74
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:42,960
many people saw Hoss as someone trying to basically express himself through content in unrealistic situations,

75
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:47,280
but equally this could just be a clever appeal to the audience in my opinion.

76
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:54,160
Hoss makes the very interesting directorial decision to make the girl's responses fairly realistic most of the time,

77
00:07:54,160 --> 00:08:01,120
that rather than just to have her immediately jump on his dick, which would say to me something much more about self gratification.

78
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:06,000
Like many rational people, the subject of his video typically becomes very uncomfortable,

79
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,400
and asks him to go away, continuously, insults him, seems absolutely disgusted like any reasonable person would,

80
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,920
and yet at the end of it suddenly has this incredible epiphany,

81
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:22,000
and decides that actually this guy who is continuously insinuated to sexually beating you to a pulp,

82
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,920
and removing various body parts might just be the man of her dreams.

83
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,040
Now when he first started out, he had these sorts of arthouse titles such as Flirt,

84
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,920
and the highly anticipated sequel, Flirt 2.

85
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:37,680
His thumbnails were pretty clickbaity, and they involved the famed female,

86
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,560
which you know, is always a good method to attract attention.

87
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,200
These videos were performing alright for his channel size,

88
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,920
but it wasn't until a significant change in these videos that they began to catch fire,

89
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,600
which was the titles.

90
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,160
Suddenly the videos were not just Flirt or Flirt 2,

91
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,680
they were videos that depicted occurrences in the present tense,

92
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:01,520
which are always naturally more clickbaity, and played off the double meaning of a quote, bold guy.

93
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:06,320
These videos really picked up, often accumulating hundreds of thousands of views.

94
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,800
Another couple details that I found interesting was how his original description read,

95
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,280
short films from my twisted brain,

96
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:17,920
and there were videos that now have been removed which looked like they didn't actually include him.

97
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,880
Also, massive shout out to Emblazon HD, hope that Minecraft channel takes off mate.

98
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,000
And so the question becomes, why did he remove those videos?

99
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I mean, it wasn't views, as they seem to be comparatively doing alright,

100
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,400
so I suppose we could say that he wanted to make his channel more about his characters,

101
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,160
and narratively coherent,

102
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,000
and I can understand why that may motivate him to remove those videos,

103
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,280
but the videos he removed showed a difference in creativity,

104
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:46,320
some sort of disconnect between the artist and the art,

105
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,080
and that's what I find interesting.

106
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:53,680
It's clear that Hoss took the decision to see Matt Hoss's zone as more integral to himself as the person,

107
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:58,560
but when he started it out, when he conceptualised it, he didn't look at it that way.

108
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,240
It begs the question, how much self-awareness was actually there?

109
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,200
Was there more self-awareness than we typically assumed?

110
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:10,720
And if so, why would he present the content as lacking so much self-awareness, supposedly?

111
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,440
Let's put these ideas on hold and move forward.

112
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,040
With the removal of content that we assume he considered irrelevant

113
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,640
to the progress of his channel, this left him with two key series,

114
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,320
Bold Guy and Horny Tony.

115
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,640
Bold Guy was known for his hilarity,

116
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,360
charisma,

117
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,160
and boldness,

118
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,440
and Horny Tony was known, well, for his horniness.

119
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,560
Both of these brands have serious sexual undercurrents,

120
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,920
and it's certainly not the sort of films you'd view on prime time television,

121
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,760
and it's quite amazing that his character hasn't been hashtag me too yet.

122
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,200
Basically, it seems like content tailored for incels,

123
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,600
the idea that somehow you can be just absolutely strange and repulsive,

124
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,280
and somehow end up with the girl, and that's what has been confusing me.

125
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:55,600
Matt Hoss writes the characters around him as completely aware of that,

126
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,240
and yet every time he seems to end up winning the girl,

127
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,480
sending a very mixed message to his audience,

128
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:06,000
it seems like some psychological tactic to present some very deluded part of the viewership,

129
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,640
with this unrealistic character to hold onto.

130
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:13,120
I think Matt Hoss is 100% aware of his character's unlikeability,

131
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,840
however when we make short films like Matt Hoss does,

132
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:19,680
we don't expect them to be character representations of ourselves,

133
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,680
and yet everyone assumed his characters like Bold Guy to be just that,

134
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,480
mainly because he often seemed to aggrandise the character

135
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,360
in a way that would somewhat represent that delusion,

136
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,480
using words in his description such as cool and funny.

137
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,080
Cool and funny, Bold Guy, doing epic parkour.

138
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,520
This was your protagonist,

139
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:42,080
but at the same time there was such an awareness of how transparently terrible he was,

140
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:45,280
I can only think that he was trying to appeal to a set of individuals

141
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,800
who were also that terrible,

142
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,440
and looking for some sort of creation of a fantasy

143
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,240
where their crude behaviour is actually successful.

144
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,440
I feel Hoss was originally distant from the characters,

145
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,160
and demonstrated it through their old content,

146
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:02,160
and I think this shows a different perspective from a lot of the narratives created,

147
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,240
and I want to explain in the next part

148
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,440
why I think this has greater implications for the lawsuits.

149
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,080

00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,560
In one of his videos about the lawsuit,

151
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,800
Hoss says that he doesn't care about the hate,

152
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,000
and in fact he lives to thrive off the animosity.

153
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,640
Despite the enemy's propaganda,

154
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:44,720
I don't care about criticism or approval regarding how I conduct my business.

155
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,600
Not only do I not care,

156
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:54,400
I am proud to stand up against massive misguided opposition

157
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:59,440
to fight for my rights and the rights of artists everywhere.

158
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,680
I feel this isn't entirely true.

159
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,440
I think on one hand, sure,

160
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,400
he loves the attention that the whole situation gave him,

161
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,440
but on the other hand,

162
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,120
there was something deeply harmful about the incident that really vexed him,

163
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,720
which is what propelled him to launch the lawsuit in the first place.

164
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,960
I feel like many of us can agree on that,

165
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,440
however I think for me the false assumption came

166
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,680
that people assumed he launched the lawsuit

167
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,560
because he represented himself in his characters,

168
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,200
and therefore felt he was personally under attack.

169
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,560
After all, on one hand,

170
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,240
I think that's where the whole defamation point of view was introduced,

171
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,960
but personally I think that was more of a legal tactic

172
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,920
to try and strengthen a case which was kind of weak,

173
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,360
by putting himself out there,

174
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,440
exposing himself to all that negativity,

175
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,840
and then using that negativity to strengthen the persecution in his case.

176
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,800
However, at some point he completely filters his comments,

177
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,560
not in a way where you would have to wait for some admin approval to post,

178
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,840
just 99% of the comments are gone, with a few remaining.

179
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,960
This says to me that he might be making a return quite soon.

180
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,840
You see, I think his content relied on a clear image

181
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,160
being portrayed to a specific demographic,

182
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,120
and here's the thing,

183
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,360
it's clear that Hoss was no stranger to hate,

184
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,640
the ratings for his videos,

185
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,240
while he still had them enabled,

186
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,400
painted a fairly polarising picture,

187
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,800
but there was clearly some sort of audience,

188
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,840
and I'm sure many people attacked him personally in the past,

189
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,000
and some of those comments are still there.

190
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,880
So there must be something unique about the H3 video,

191
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:23,440
which you know,

192
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,280
you have to understand H3 to know what they can do with their brand,

193
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:30,560
the clients and their reaction videos have a way of impacting

194
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,200
how certain characters are viewed by an audience.

195
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,760
The thing about Bold Guy is that you view his videos

196
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,520
in the context of his arc,

197
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,360
and that creative output.

198
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,720
Ethan and Hila decontextualised his video in that sense,

199
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,320
and they had every right to.

200
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,840
However, they took it out of the world that Hoss wanted it to be shown in,

201
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,800
and in my opinion,

202
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,040
this is what concerned Hoss the most,

203
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,480
he had an idea of how his audience were viewing his character,

204
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,320
the fact that his appeal of his content

205
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,760
had been swayed in a different direction was what caught his eye.

206
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:03,200
Many people thought Hoss saw their portrayal as an affront to him,

207
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:06,800
but I think he was concerned about the greater popular implications

208
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,000
that followed the video,

209
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,920
for the character that he himself was not greatly invested in.

210
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,520
You see, with their reaction video,

211
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:17,440
I think what threatened Hoss above all was the implications from being memed

212
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,560
by Ethan and Hila,

213
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:22,320
the idea that the brand he created so finely was under threat.

214
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,440
You see, there are huge implications from being memed,

215
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,240
not only does it completely shift a public perception

216
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,480
of something that you may be taking seriously,

217
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,400
but if you can't transcend the meme,

218
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,720
then you know you're running on borrowed time.

219
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,000
Memes become boring,

220
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
if you cannot redefine yourself there,

221
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,840
then you will get lost in the vault.

222
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:43,200
Many people are under the impression that the Ethan and Hila situation

223
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:46,880
was the first time that he tried to silence someone over such pretenses,

224
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,400
but in fact I reached out to one of the actresses in his video

225
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:53,440
who was under a similar predicament, Anika Reitman.

226
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,720
She told me that Hoss refused to let her use any of the content,

227
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,240
not even for an acting reel,

228
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,440
despite the fact that she testified that they had collaborated heavily

229
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,720
on each part of the process,

230
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,360
and it was part of the agreement for her participation.

231
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,080
She tried to upload this acting reel onto her channel,

232
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,920
and he had her channel suspended,

233
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,160
and even threatened to take her to court.

234
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,160
Sounds eerily similar, doesn't it?

235
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,440
She even posted a comment on the video five years ago,

236
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,360
well before the H3 situation.

237
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,000
On top of this,

238
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,160
she also said how although she found Matt to be a fairly unpleasant person,

239
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,520
he wasn't the awkward quirk that he often depicted in his work,

240
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:30,400
and that there was a degree of separation from himself

241
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,240
and the character in the presentation,

242
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,520
although not in their goal,

243
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:36,480
as Matt was quick to offer to take her out after shooting.

244
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,120
On top of this,

245
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,400
Anika also believed the character that Hoss created

246
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,400
was made to appeal to a demographic,

247
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:46,000
a very specific one that she herself claimed to receive flak from.

248
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,240
I believe that with this knowledge we can apply

249
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,040
and create a theory that suggests Matt was quite aware

250
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,040
of the sort of content that he was making,

251
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:57,440
and upon realising the potential sought to protect its image at all costs,

252
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,440
whether it was attacking larger YouTubers,

253
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,120
or even the people who worked with him,

254
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,280
and actually gave him their time.

255
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:06,080
So we bring this back to Ethan and Ela's content.

256
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:09,760
What it did was basically turn Hoss' video into a bit of a joke,

257
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,720
and that annoyed him,

258
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,760
we can all agree on that,

259
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,520
but in my opinion he wasn't annoyed because it personally insulted him,

260
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:20,480
because it put his content into a box where shelf life had been cut criminally short.

261
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,280
In my opinion,

262
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,240
he wanted these videos to do well for the right reasons,

263
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,360
and he knew that when Ethan and Ela uploaded their video,

264
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,920
those reasons were evaporating rather quickly.

265
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:33,200
In the tone of what he created following the filing of the lawsuit,

266
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:37,280
it almost portrayed this guy who was deeply insecure in what he was creating,

267
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,840
and someone who viewed themselves as under attack.

268
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,120
When really the lawsuit in my opinion was a tactical move,

269
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,920
I think he was completely aware of his character,

270
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,840
but he knew there was a demographic for it.

271
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,280
The thing is, the internet brings together those sorts of people.

272
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:55,280
Matt wanted to create a world where the creepy awkward weirdo wins the girl,

273
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,000
and when Ethan and Ela ran a very different narrative,

274
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,480
he knew that the brand was on borrowed time,

275
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,360
that he'd become some kind of ironic joke.

276
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,160
So here we are,

277
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,920
we have H3 creating a mockery out of the content that you love,

278
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,200
and Hoss, legally speaking, is up against it.

279
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:15,040
In a way, fair use is considered to be a prevailing thing,

280
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,520
and H3 isn't your everyday creator,

281
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,400
you can't just strike down the channel without anyone noticing,

282
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:25,280
so he had to stop H3, or perhaps sacrifice everything that he had worked for,

283
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,360
from his perspective at least.

284
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,360
And this is where we address the lawsuits.

285
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:39,440
The Lawsuit

286
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,560
The lawsuit itself was handled very interestingly by Hoss.

287
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:45,920
See, he went in with an author which included the clause that

288
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,600
they never talk about him again,

289
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,960
and he asked for the total of $3,750,

290
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,000
which you know, although is substantial money in my opinion,

291
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,160
Hoss considered that amount to be the sort of money that H3 might compromise on,

292
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:03,600
and the money itself was probably for damage to what he considered to be his brand's reputation.

293
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,200
Another point that I believe helps is the additional compromise that he offered,

294
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,960
as shown in H3's clip here.

295
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:44,320
H3 went into this under the impression that it wouldn't have to be taken to court.

296
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,600
H3 made the point that setting the standards was the concern,

297
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,920
but Hoss himself wasn't interested in that, he was interested in preservation.

298
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:55,040
Ethan and Hila said that they had already promoted his content,

299
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,880
and that was true, but that's the thing,

300
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,240
they had promoted it in a way that had contradicted what it stood for.

301
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,120
Ethan and Hila, when they were watching that content,

302
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,960
and many viewers, assumed that it was just some guy doing wacky parkour,

303
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,480
out in his own little world,

304
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,280
but what they'd actually done was publicise content

305
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:15,280
that had very different intentions for what they had interpreted it as.

306
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,720
However, this message that I personally think Hoss promoted in the videos

307
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,880
about the creepy guy getting the girl,

308
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,640
although seemingly obvious,

309
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,960
was often one that was somewhat subliminal,

310
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:30,960
and its appeal to the audience relied on them not outwardly acknowledging their interests,

311
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,640
ones that are rather twisted,

312
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,160
and therefore having a pair of comedians explicitly interpreted

313
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,760
in a completely different way,

314
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,800
undermined that slight message that Hoss was trying to push,

315
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:44,400
and therefore by retaining the serious credibility of his content

316
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,480
in a promotion by H3 that would have been very different to their original video,

317
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,600
he would have been able to continue making what he wanted to,

318
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,280
rather than being a laughing stock.

319
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,320
With that said, if H3 had made that promotional video,

320
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,280
I think it would have been rather embarrassing for Hoss given the response,

321
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:03,040
and I think he misinterpreted how people may have responded to that.

322
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:06,720
You see, many people see Hoss as a reactionary who lashed out,

323
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,760
and make no mistake, he probably has that side to him,

324
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,800
but at the same time, the lawsuit itself was very calculated,

325
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:17,520
and clearly represented what he thought was a threat to his own content and interpretation.

326
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,400
Now as mentioned earlier, Hoss was the face of the lawsuit,

327
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,760
and that's a real difference,

328
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,600
when he realised that this probably wasn't going to be resolved in the initial stage,

329
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,880
he switched game plan.

330
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:31,120
One very interesting incident was this one, as documented by Ethan and Hila.

331
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,080
Also worth mentioning, that was particularly obnoxious,

332
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,640
is that while we were in negotiations for everything,

333
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,400
that one night when he was just real angry and bitter,

334
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,880
he, on a privated video that was already removed,

335
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,640
I guess he still had the URL,

336
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,880
and he did a strike, he did a takedown on our video,

337
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,160
when we were in good faith negotiations just because he wanted to up us.

338
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:55,280
However, I personally find it rather implausible that Hoss just flew into some spontaneous rage

339
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,320
and struck the video,

340
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:01,520
I much more find it plausible that he did that with the intention to provoke backlash onto himself,

341
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,720
so that he would subsequently receive hate from angry H3 fans,

342
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,960
which he would then use to fuel his case,

343
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:11,440
firstly in his own content, and subsequently as reflected in the lawsuit itself.

344
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,360
I'm impressed.

345
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:18,080
If you look at the numbers, those are two very successful hashtags.

346
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,880
You didn't spell my name on one of them though,

347
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,880
but I could hurt you when they searched for the hashtag.

348
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:27,040
Hoss was completely aware of the court's ignorance of most of the internet culture,

349
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:31,840
and I think he realised that if he could paint himself to be a victim of harassment convincingly enough,

350
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:35,280
he would be able to prove a point that his character had been defamed,

351
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,600
as by proof he was receiving so much hate,

352
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,200
and by documenting the success of the comments and their vitriol,

353
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,080
he could then use them as a case going forward.

354
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,800
Hoss was always up against it, and I think he knew that,

355
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,960
but I feel like he didn't want to back down,

356
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,320
that he wanted to keep on that notion that he always wins,

357
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,160
the fact that he always got the girl,

358
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:58,000
and therefore by striking the video a seemingly inconsequential act,

359
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,520
he had it documented and riled up the people, H3 included.

360
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,560
He was prepared for that hate, and he used it to his advantage.

361
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:07,600
He followed the extreme hate comment video up with another video

362
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,360
specifically addressed in the situation,

363
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,880
and branding basically everyone who was against him as liars.

364
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,480
He knew people hated him,

365
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:18,640
but equally he knew that the courts wouldn't really care about his reputation.

366
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,120
Hoss saw this as an all or nothing moment,

367
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:25,280
either he ends up being the walking parkour meme that H3 made him out to be,

368
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,600
and be confined within that narrative,

369
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:31,040
or end their careers and scare away future commentators.

370
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,600
With that said, I think he really passed the point of no return

371
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,520
after initiating the lawsuit,

372
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:43,200
and who knows how the public would have responded if he'd won the case,

373
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,080
but either way, he wanted to finish what he started.

374
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:50,800
You see, this is where Hoss welded the ideas of the character and himself together,

375
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,400
overtly for the first time.

376
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,840
So when he was attacked, he turned it into this personal issue,

377
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,320
and thus used the attacks against him as evidence.

378
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,480
He suddenly switched to commentary content,

379
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,240
which is naturally more personal,

380
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,800
and tried to walk this very weird line of connecting

381
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,920
his on-screen persona with his personality.

382
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:12,080
The one I'm voting for is Jill Stein, of the Green Party.

383
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,440
I mean, come on, if you're a straight male or a lesbian,

384
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,880
and you're looking for a Gilf, Jill's the one you want.

385
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,960
Even in ways that made very little sense,

386
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,760
and didn't link up to how other people had viewed him before.

387
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:27,920
H3 themselves, despite understanding the difference between fiction and reality,

388
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:31,120
as expressed in many videos, such as their recent one on Seinfeld,

389
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:35,360
decided by assumption that Bolgai's personality represented Matt Hoss.

390
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,120
But it didn't necessarily,

391
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,920
Bolgai just represented a character from a film,

392
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,160
a short film from The Twisted Mind.

393
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,800
What you'll find interesting now is how,

394
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,800
in spite of loving the hate at the time,

395
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:49,120
Hoss has now removed basically all comments,

396
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:53,040
and is clearly very carefully vetting the sections on how he is presented,

397
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,800
particularly on his newer videos.

398
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,960
They all have exceptionally low numbers of comments,

399
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,760
and Hoss hasn't actually put an approval filter on it.

400
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,640
No, he just removed 99% of comments.

401
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,520
I know this because I tested it by leaving a comment,

402
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,560
and it immediately went up, and he then favoured it.

403
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,280
Cheers Matt.

404
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,840
He's clearly very eager to move forward with his channel,

405
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,280
and distance himself from the image portrayed by H3's content,

406
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:18,000
and in my opinion, the hanging legacy over it all

407
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,720
is the reason why he's probably delayed uploading again.

408
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,600
This mattered much more than just a personal affront,

409
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,280
that Hoss lashed out again.

410
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:28,320
In my opinion, Hoss is a calculated individual.

411
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,760
From the first days of his content,

412
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:34,320
he blatantly changed it to create a brand identifiable with a certain demographic,

413
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:38,480
and to appeal to a specific audience through that very specific branding,

414
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,040
something that the sporadic online personality

415
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,520
that people often framed him as, wouldn't do.

416
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,040
If he was a Tommy Wiseau,

417
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:45,760
Oh hi Mark,

418
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,960
like fully in that sense,

419
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,960
he wouldn't have necessarily cared whether that content was marketable or not,

420
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,760
but he did.

421
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,400
He always set up a very specific character arc,

422
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,600
and not one that necessarily reflected him as a person.

423
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:01,680
The threat H3 posed was not that it threatened the perception of him as a person,

424
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:04,080
because although he certainly is a character,

425
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,000
Bold Guy was not Matt Hoss.

426
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,200
No, it was because it threatened the perception of his brand,

427
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,720
one that he had fine-tuned to cast to a particular group of people,

428
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,960
in my opinion, perhaps incels even,

429
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,960
and his response was not one of reflex,

430
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:21,680
but one that would seek to preserve that established reputation as much as possible,

431
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:24,720
which unfortunately for him, H3 called him out on,

432
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,400
publicised the incident further,

433
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,040
and likely pushed that reputation over the edge.

434
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,080
But even at that point,

435
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,160
it didn't stop him from trying a few tricks,

436
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,720
and making it look like a personal attack,

437
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,240
by changing up his content,

438
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,640
and integrating it very uncomfortably.

439
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,560
Unfortunately, these tactics were futile when it came down to the matter of law,

440
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:47,040
whether he'll be able to bring back that audience with all this legacy hanging over him,

441
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,240
is another question,

442
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,120
but I believe he's a bit more grounded than people think,

443
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:55,520
and underestimating people's calculated nature is something we should never do.

444
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:59,120
Matt Hoss is a shark in the water, waiting to strike,

445
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:03,120
and I feel that maybe during the situation people were paying more attention to that.

446
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,680
This isn't to say I think Matt Hoss is a genius, far from it,

447
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:09,440
but I find the portrayal of him as some sort of clumsy and reactionary villain,

448
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,680
one that is a bit inaccurate.

449
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,120
Reflected in the lawsuit,

450
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,960
I see it as much more of a calculated power play,

451
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:22,240
one where he wanted to show himself as the guy who wins in the end,

452
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,200
and to impress that sect of audience who admired him,

453
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,560
the people who wanted him to win,

454
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:29,840
to show that he is the guy who gets the girl at the end of the day,

455
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,200
and yet he failed,

456
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,520
perhaps undermining his whole reputation.

457
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:36,080
I mean, can you see him doing political commentary?

458
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,720
And that's where Republicans and Democrats are,

459
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,040
two different flavors of the same thing.

460
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,520
What we need is at least a third option,

461
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:45,840
like a pineapple.

462
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,840
Ah, neat.

463
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,320
Just don't put that on a pizza, bastards.

464
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,880
So that was the video,

465
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,400
a lot of hard work into this one,

466
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,840
I'd love to hear your thoughts on it.

467
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,640
Matt Hoss' motivations are really unclear,

468
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:02,480
and honestly, the aim of this video was just to prevent an alternative perspective,

469
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,960
it's not one that I necessarily think is correct,

470
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,440
but I thought it was a really interesting angle to take it,

471
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:11,280
and I would love to hear what people think about his motivations in the comments below.

472
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:13,760
On top of that, I want to give a big shout out to the editors,

473
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,520
they have done a fantastic job,

474
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,680
I'm gonna leave their links in the pinned comment,

475
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,040
go and check them out.

476
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:21,600
Also, a big shout out to my Patreons,

477
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,280
some of them on screen right now,

478
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,200
lovely, lovely people, thank you so much,

479
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,920
and a special thanks to Ryan, you beautiful man,

480
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,200
you are insane.

481
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,280
I don't know why you do it, but you do it for me,

482
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,400
and that's what matters.

483
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:35,040
As an extra here, I have to give a shout out to Connor

484
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:37,760
for his $50 donation to my Patreon,

485
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,440
once again, incredibly generous,

486
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,040
I really appreciate it, my friend,

487
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,320
I really appreciate it.

488
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,000
My throat is still dying.

489
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,520
If you wanna speak to me about this,

490
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,360
Twitter, at the right opinion,

491
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,040
Facebook, Discord,

492
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,000
they work too,

493
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,240
you know, whatever tickles your fancy.

494
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,760
I don't really have too much else to say,

495
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,760
I'm pretty knackered as it is,

496
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,280
but I hope you enjoyed the video,

497
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:59,680
and I hope it provided something a bit more spicy,

498
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:02,640
because I wanted to do something a bit more different this time,

499
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,080
and it was a hard one,

500
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,520
it was a hard theory to put forward,

501
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,840
especially when you're dealing with a lot of hypotheticals,

502
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,720
but something about Matt Hoss always did just kind of

503
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,200
throw me off about his character presentations,

504
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,680
which I think presents an ulterior motivation,

505
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:18,000
but we can have that discussion another time.

506
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,840
Until then, I'm The Right Opinion,

507
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,360
and I will see you in the next one.
