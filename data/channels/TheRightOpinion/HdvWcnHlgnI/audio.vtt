Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time,

00:10.640 --> 00:15.640
and today I've decided to cover a topic that I've always wanted to, and I feel that time is now,

00:15.640 --> 00:20.640
because chances are, when this video comes out, I'll be away on holiday, and won't have the chance to cover any

00:20.640 --> 00:25.640
topics that are necessarily trending, but I have to say, out of all the people I've covered on this channel,

00:25.640 --> 00:31.840
I think there are few people more intriguing than the person I've decided to cover today, and that person is Matt Hoss.

00:31.840 --> 00:36.840
And if you're wondering who he is, well, you shouldn't be, but he is infamous amongst the internet community

00:36.840 --> 00:44.120
for suing Ethan and Hila Klein, aka H3H3 Productions, over a reaction video they made on their second channel,

00:44.120 --> 00:50.360
known as The Big, The Bold, The Beautiful, in which they delivered their signature reaction style commentary.

00:50.360 --> 00:55.160
When I was a very small commentator, I made a little video called Matt Hoss Could Win,

00:55.200 --> 00:59.960
in which I expressed my feelings on the whole lawsuit, and how in fact he could be successful.

00:59.960 --> 01:05.560
At the time, fair use was still a very untested concept, and there had been cases in the past where creators had

01:05.560 --> 01:11.720
lost against claimants, so I was especially sceptical of how some out of touch court might handle the case.

01:11.720 --> 01:17.360
I think it was a justified concern, and at the end of the video, your sister snapped and went off on a memorable rant

01:17.360 --> 01:21.680
that today would make such a typically placid individual like myself cringe.

01:21.680 --> 01:27.920
That video was really the first taste of any success I had, as it amassed approximately 50,000 views at the time,

01:27.920 --> 01:33.080
and I was pretty excited, I mean, what would this spell for an aspiring commentator like myself?

01:33.080 --> 01:37.760
Well, basically nothing for another year, as all my videos afterwards didn't do much,

01:37.760 --> 01:44.880
but I guess today, like Chris Martin once said, we're going back to the start, because I do find Matt Hoss a fascinating bloke.

01:44.880 --> 01:50.400
Matt Hoss' channel is known as The Matt Hoss Zone, he did used to have an Instagram, but that's gone,

01:50.400 --> 01:54.920
and he's been relatively inactive on all platforms, bar the occasional appearance on Facebook,

01:54.920 --> 02:00.080
where he expresses his distaste of Donald Trump, and promises his inevitable return to the followers

02:00.080 --> 02:03.640
who are eagerly awaiting another masterpiece from the Maestro himself.

02:03.640 --> 02:10.240
As a creator, he is fairly established, running on the platform for a few years with a fairly respectable backlog of content.

02:10.240 --> 02:16.440
His description reads, original comedy, action, horror, and fantasy short films, with electronic dance music,

02:16.480 --> 02:22.080
for the mind of Matt Hossainzadeh, Hossainzadeh being his full last name, which you know, he has mercifully shortened,

02:22.080 --> 02:26.440
so I appreciate that. It's probably going to knock around 10 minutes off this video.

02:26.440 --> 02:32.680
The original comedy, action, horror, and fantasy short films were a mix of him picking up girls with his mad parkour,

02:32.680 --> 02:40.640
with some vampires thrown in there, I mean, that's a simplification, but I think a lot of people tend to look at his content as Matt.

02:40.680 --> 02:49.120
There is no other way to describe his channel other than, it's Matt Hoss, unfiltered Matt Hoss, like the room was unfiltered Tommy Wiseau,

02:49.120 --> 02:55.120
but I'm not so sure about that. This is where H3 are introduced, most people know how the story goes,

02:55.120 --> 03:01.280
that basically Matt filed a civil action against H3 under the premise that their use of content wasn't there,

03:01.280 --> 03:06.200
and defamed his character. H3 disputed this, and this then escalated to the courts.

03:06.320 --> 03:12.360
Fortunately, this time round, the judge then, Catherine Forrest, the absolute legend, ruled in favour of the Clines.

03:12.360 --> 03:19.720
It was probably one of the most famous motions, and it was heartwarming to see an often divided community uniting for the cause of something

03:19.720 --> 03:25.840
that transcended the differences. Matt Hoss, the man at the centre of this lawsuit, became the sort of Disney villain of YouTube.

03:25.840 --> 03:31.920
He himself was a content creator, and thus the lawsuit felt very personal. I spoke about this in my Smosh video,

03:31.920 --> 03:39.920
but often when businesses file lawsuits, there is a lack of accountability. We'll hate the business, but they have no personality to hone in on,

03:39.920 --> 03:48.400
they have no face to lambast. Matt Hoss put himself at the front and centre of the controversy, and there were very few people who were willing to defend him,

03:48.400 --> 03:55.280
he didn't set himself out there as a likeable character. He often came across as highly egocentric and narcissistic,

03:55.280 --> 04:02.520
and people tended to hone in on this. People hated him for it, and when videos came out, they were very critical of Matt Hoss in the moment,

04:02.520 --> 04:08.920
but no one really asked why he did it, and in a way, when the situation is transpiring, I wouldn't expect people to.

04:08.920 --> 04:16.160
The stakes seemed very high, and theorising over motivations when they weren't exactly relevant to the outcome seemed unnecessary,

04:16.160 --> 04:21.200
but I feel like now that time has passed and we're all on the tubes, chilling, like the fellow kids we are,

04:21.200 --> 04:28.480
I feel like maybe we do have time for a discussion, because as said, I really do find the character of Hoss a very captivating one.

04:28.480 --> 04:34.400
I think many people at the time just saw him as this delusional reactionary, completely high off his own hubris,

04:34.400 --> 04:42.160
and with this image in his head that he was under personal attack. And you know, when you look at the evidence, it's 100% credible,

04:42.160 --> 04:50.960
and one that I even may agree with to an extent, but I want to have a discussion because I think there was a level of calculation that many people do not pay attention to,

04:50.960 --> 04:56.400
and I want to watch his videos so we can perhaps understand the mind and motivations of Matt Hoss.

04:56.400 --> 05:02.080
I'm someone who likes to find rationale and logic in everything, and although I accept that it's not always the case,

05:02.080 --> 05:09.520
it's hard to believe that in spite of these slightly blurred lines of fair use, that Matt Hoss would end up likely throwing copious amounts of money away

05:09.520 --> 05:14.520
to protect some semblance of personal reputation which he tried to reflect in his rhetoric.

05:14.520 --> 05:19.600
That makes very little sense to me, and I want to see if we can find an alternative explanation.

05:19.640 --> 05:26.720
There are a lot of details pre and post Lawsuit that I think can perhaps present a case that is very different to the one we assume as truth,

05:26.720 --> 05:33.920
and I hope maybe I can provide a new take to an old situation, but to do that we have to cut the crap and enter the Matt Hoss zone,

05:33.920 --> 05:42.400
which is a zone like no other, so I suggest we light up the fuse, burn it up, because at The Right Opinion, we go hard, and never go home.

05:42.400 --> 05:44.880
Ready, set, go.

05:49.600 --> 06:00.160
The Matt Hoss character is a very interesting one, and one that does seem to be pretty consistent throughout his content.

06:00.160 --> 06:05.360
Apart from these social commentaries, which is another barrel of fish that we'll have to knock over in a bit,

06:05.360 --> 06:12.320
what happens is that you have this protagonist, namely our hero, Daddy Matt here, bold guy typically,

06:12.320 --> 06:16.320
and what we see is him swooping in on this girl, the alpha male that he is.

06:16.400 --> 06:21.840
Often this girl will play hard to get, be difficult, and not comply with Hoss's obvious advances,

06:21.840 --> 06:26.880
however you see Matt Hoss isn't easily defeated, and will persist until he has the female.

06:26.880 --> 06:32.880
The first video that he has up is a video known as Flirt, he did have one up before that was called In Blood,

06:32.880 --> 06:39.520
however it has been taken down, but one can assume that that was more of the horror themed content that he was looking at,

06:39.600 --> 06:45.360
and Flirt is much more to a formula, Hoss moves in, girl says no, Matt Hoss translates as yes,

06:45.360 --> 06:48.720
and goes at it until she gives in to his manly charms.

07:01.040 --> 07:06.160
See, where me and H3 disagree is that I don't think Matt Hoss is some old school cringe tube,

07:06.160 --> 07:10.480
I think he's one of those corners of the internet that people say they've been to once,

07:10.480 --> 07:14.960
and come back from, and aren't really interested in checking it out a second time.

07:14.960 --> 07:24.160
It seems like it once again appeals to a select set of people who are looking to fulfil their position of being able to place themselves as the protagonist,

07:24.160 --> 07:29.040
and live out their dreams of picking up a girl by telling her that basically they want to vore them,

07:29.040 --> 07:31.360
that's what this is, dressed up vore.

07:31.440 --> 07:36.480
The thing is, that on one hand this presents the delusion that many people associated Hoss with,

07:36.480 --> 07:42.960
many people saw Hoss as someone trying to basically express himself through content in unrealistic situations,

07:42.960 --> 07:47.280
but equally this could just be a clever appeal to the audience in my opinion.

07:47.280 --> 07:54.160
Hoss makes the very interesting directorial decision to make the girl's responses fairly realistic most of the time,

07:54.160 --> 08:01.120
that rather than just to have her immediately jump on his dick, which would say to me something much more about self gratification.

08:01.120 --> 08:06.000
Like many rational people, the subject of his video typically becomes very uncomfortable,

08:06.000 --> 08:12.400
and asks him to go away, continuously, insults him, seems absolutely disgusted like any reasonable person would,

08:12.400 --> 08:15.920
and yet at the end of it suddenly has this incredible epiphany,

08:15.920 --> 08:22.000
and decides that actually this guy who is continuously insinuated to sexually beating you to a pulp,

08:22.000 --> 08:25.920
and removing various body parts might just be the man of her dreams.

08:26.000 --> 08:31.040
Now when he first started out, he had these sorts of arthouse titles such as Flirt,

08:31.040 --> 08:33.920
and the highly anticipated sequel, Flirt 2.

08:33.920 --> 08:37.680
His thumbnails were pretty clickbaity, and they involved the famed female,

08:37.680 --> 08:40.560
which you know, is always a good method to attract attention.

08:40.560 --> 08:43.200
These videos were performing alright for his channel size,

08:43.200 --> 08:47.920
but it wasn't until a significant change in these videos that they began to catch fire,

08:47.920 --> 08:49.600
which was the titles.

08:49.600 --> 08:52.160
Suddenly the videos were not just Flirt or Flirt 2,

08:52.160 --> 08:55.680
they were videos that depicted occurrences in the present tense,

08:55.680 --> 09:01.520
which are always naturally more clickbaity, and played off the double meaning of a quote, bold guy.

09:01.520 --> 09:06.320
These videos really picked up, often accumulating hundreds of thousands of views.

09:06.320 --> 09:10.800
Another couple details that I found interesting was how his original description read,

09:10.800 --> 09:13.280
short films from my twisted brain,

09:13.280 --> 09:17.920
and there were videos that now have been removed which looked like they didn't actually include him.

09:17.920 --> 09:22.880
Also, massive shout out to Emblazon HD, hope that Minecraft channel takes off mate.

09:22.880 --> 09:26.000
And so the question becomes, why did he remove those videos?

09:26.000 --> 09:30.000
I mean, it wasn't views, as they seem to be comparatively doing alright,

09:30.000 --> 09:34.400
so I suppose we could say that he wanted to make his channel more about his characters,

09:34.400 --> 09:36.160
and narratively coherent,

09:36.160 --> 09:40.000
and I can understand why that may motivate him to remove those videos,

09:40.000 --> 09:43.280
but the videos he removed showed a difference in creativity,

09:43.280 --> 09:46.320
some sort of disconnect between the artist and the art,

09:46.320 --> 09:48.080
and that's what I find interesting.

09:48.080 --> 09:53.680
It's clear that Hoss took the decision to see Matt Hoss's zone as more integral to himself as the person,

09:53.680 --> 09:58.560
but when he started it out, when he conceptualised it, he didn't look at it that way.

09:58.560 --> 10:02.240
It begs the question, how much self-awareness was actually there?

10:02.240 --> 10:05.200
Was there more self-awareness than we typically assumed?

10:05.200 --> 10:10.720
And if so, why would he present the content as lacking so much self-awareness, supposedly?

10:10.720 --> 10:13.440
Let's put these ideas on hold and move forward.

10:13.440 --> 10:17.040
With the removal of content that we assume he considered irrelevant

10:17.040 --> 10:20.640
to the progress of his channel, this left him with two key series,

10:20.640 --> 10:22.320
Bold Guy and Horny Tony.

10:22.320 --> 10:24.640
Bold Guy was known for his hilarity,

10:24.640 --> 10:25.360
charisma,

10:25.360 --> 10:26.160
and boldness,

10:26.160 --> 10:29.440
and Horny Tony was known, well, for his horniness.

10:29.440 --> 10:32.560
Both of these brands have serious sexual undercurrents,

10:32.560 --> 10:35.920
and it's certainly not the sort of films you'd view on prime time television,

10:35.920 --> 10:39.760
and it's quite amazing that his character hasn't been hashtag me too yet.

10:39.760 --> 10:43.200
Basically, it seems like content tailored for incels,

10:43.200 --> 10:47.600
the idea that somehow you can be just absolutely strange and repulsive,

10:47.600 --> 10:51.280
and somehow end up with the girl, and that's what has been confusing me.

10:51.280 --> 10:55.600
Matt Hoss writes the characters around him as completely aware of that,

10:55.600 --> 10:58.240
and yet every time he seems to end up winning the girl,

10:58.240 --> 11:00.480
sending a very mixed message to his audience,

11:00.480 --> 11:06.000
it seems like some psychological tactic to present some very deluded part of the viewership,

11:06.000 --> 11:08.640
with this unrealistic character to hold onto.

11:08.640 --> 11:13.120
I think Matt Hoss is 100% aware of his character's unlikeability,

11:13.120 --> 11:15.840
however when we make short films like Matt Hoss does,

11:15.840 --> 11:19.680
we don't expect them to be character representations of ourselves,

11:19.680 --> 11:23.680
and yet everyone assumed his characters like Bold Guy to be just that,

11:23.680 --> 11:26.480
mainly because he often seemed to aggrandise the character

11:26.480 --> 11:29.360
in a way that would somewhat represent that delusion,

11:29.360 --> 11:32.480
using words in his description such as cool and funny.

11:32.480 --> 11:36.080
Cool and funny, Bold Guy, doing epic parkour.

11:36.080 --> 11:37.520
This was your protagonist,

11:37.520 --> 11:42.080
but at the same time there was such an awareness of how transparently terrible he was,

11:42.080 --> 11:45.280
I can only think that he was trying to appeal to a set of individuals

11:45.280 --> 11:46.800
who were also that terrible,

11:46.800 --> 11:49.440
and looking for some sort of creation of a fantasy

11:49.440 --> 11:52.240
where their crude behaviour is actually successful.

11:52.240 --> 11:55.440
I feel Hoss was originally distant from the characters,

11:55.440 --> 11:58.160
and demonstrated it through their old content,

11:58.160 --> 12:02.160
and I think this shows a different perspective from a lot of the narratives created,

12:02.160 --> 12:04.240
and I want to explain in the next part

12:04.240 --> 12:07.440
why I think this has greater implications for the lawsuits.

12:12.080 --> 12:14.080
CLIP

12:28.560 --> 12:30.560
In one of his videos about the lawsuit,

12:30.560 --> 12:32.800
Hoss says that he doesn't care about the hate,

12:32.800 --> 12:36.000
and in fact he lives to thrive off the animosity.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.640
Despite the enemy's propaganda,

12:38.640 --> 12:44.720
I don't care about criticism or approval regarding how I conduct my business.

12:45.760 --> 12:47.600
Not only do I not care,

12:47.600 --> 12:54.400
I am proud to stand up against massive misguided opposition

12:54.400 --> 12:59.440
to fight for my rights and the rights of artists everywhere.

12:59.440 --> 13:01.680
I feel this isn't entirely true.

13:01.680 --> 13:03.440
I think on one hand, sure,

13:03.440 --> 13:06.400
he loves the attention that the whole situation gave him,

13:06.400 --> 13:07.440
but on the other hand,

13:07.440 --> 13:11.120
there was something deeply harmful about the incident that really vexed him,

13:11.120 --> 13:14.720
which is what propelled him to launch the lawsuit in the first place.

13:14.720 --> 13:16.960
I feel like many of us can agree on that,

13:16.960 --> 13:19.440
however I think for me the false assumption came

13:19.440 --> 13:21.680
that people assumed he launched the lawsuit

13:21.680 --> 13:24.560
because he represented himself in his characters,

13:24.560 --> 13:27.200
and therefore felt he was personally under attack.

13:27.200 --> 13:28.560
After all, on one hand,

13:28.560 --> 13:32.240
I think that's where the whole defamation point of view was introduced,

13:32.240 --> 13:34.960
but personally I think that was more of a legal tactic

13:34.960 --> 13:37.920
to try and strengthen a case which was kind of weak,

13:37.920 --> 13:39.360
by putting himself out there,

13:39.360 --> 13:41.440
exposing himself to all that negativity,

13:41.440 --> 13:45.840
and then using that negativity to strengthen the persecution in his case.

13:45.840 --> 13:48.800
However, at some point he completely filters his comments,

13:48.800 --> 13:52.560
not in a way where you would have to wait for some admin approval to post,

13:52.560 --> 13:55.840
just 99% of the comments are gone, with a few remaining.

13:55.840 --> 13:58.960
This says to me that he might be making a return quite soon.

13:58.960 --> 14:01.840
You see, I think his content relied on a clear image

14:01.840 --> 14:04.160
being portrayed to a specific demographic,

14:04.160 --> 14:05.120
and here's the thing,

14:05.120 --> 14:07.360
it's clear that Hoss was no stranger to hate,

14:07.360 --> 14:08.640
the ratings for his videos,

14:08.640 --> 14:10.240
while he still had them enabled,

14:10.240 --> 14:12.400
painted a fairly polarising picture,

14:12.400 --> 14:14.800
but there was clearly some sort of audience,

14:14.800 --> 14:17.840
and I'm sure many people attacked him personally in the past,

14:17.840 --> 14:20.000
and some of those comments are still there.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.880
So there must be something unique about the H3 video,

14:22.880 --> 14:23.440
which you know,

14:23.440 --> 14:27.280
you have to understand H3 to know what they can do with their brand,

14:27.280 --> 14:30.560
the clients and their reaction videos have a way of impacting

14:30.560 --> 14:33.200
how certain characters are viewed by an audience.

14:33.200 --> 14:35.760
The thing about Bold Guy is that you view his videos

14:35.760 --> 14:37.520
in the context of his arc,

14:37.520 --> 14:39.360
and that creative output.

14:39.360 --> 14:42.720
Ethan and Hila decontextualised his video in that sense,

14:42.720 --> 14:44.320
and they had every right to.

14:44.320 --> 14:47.840
However, they took it out of the world that Hoss wanted it to be shown in,

14:47.840 --> 14:48.800
and in my opinion,

14:48.800 --> 14:51.040
this is what concerned Hoss the most,

14:51.040 --> 14:54.480
he had an idea of how his audience were viewing his character,

14:54.480 --> 14:56.320
the fact that his appeal of his content

14:56.320 --> 14:59.760
had been swayed in a different direction was what caught his eye.

14:59.760 --> 15:03.200
Many people thought Hoss saw their portrayal as an affront to him,

15:03.200 --> 15:06.800
but I think he was concerned about the greater popular implications

15:06.800 --> 15:08.000
that followed the video,

15:08.000 --> 15:11.920
for the character that he himself was not greatly invested in.

15:11.920 --> 15:13.520
You see, with their reaction video,

15:13.520 --> 15:17.440
I think what threatened Hoss above all was the implications from being memed

15:17.440 --> 15:18.560
by Ethan and Hila,

15:18.560 --> 15:22.320
the idea that the brand he created so finely was under threat.

15:22.320 --> 15:25.440
You see, there are huge implications from being memed,

15:25.440 --> 15:28.240
not only does it completely shift a public perception

15:28.240 --> 15:30.480
of something that you may be taking seriously,

15:30.480 --> 15:32.400
but if you can't transcend the meme,

15:32.400 --> 15:34.720
then you know you're running on borrowed time.

15:34.720 --> 15:36.000
Memes become boring,

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
if you cannot redefine yourself there,

15:38.000 --> 15:39.840
then you will get lost in the vault.

15:39.840 --> 15:43.200
Many people are under the impression that the Ethan and Hila situation

15:43.200 --> 15:46.880
was the first time that he tried to silence someone over such pretenses,

15:46.880 --> 15:50.400
but in fact I reached out to one of the actresses in his video

15:50.400 --> 15:53.440
who was under a similar predicament, Anika Reitman.

15:53.440 --> 15:56.720
She told me that Hoss refused to let her use any of the content,

15:56.720 --> 15:58.240
not even for an acting reel,

15:58.240 --> 16:01.440
despite the fact that she testified that they had collaborated heavily

16:01.440 --> 16:02.720
on each part of the process,

16:02.720 --> 16:05.360
and it was part of the agreement for her participation.

16:05.360 --> 16:08.080
She tried to upload this acting reel onto her channel,

16:08.080 --> 16:09.920
and he had her channel suspended,

16:09.920 --> 16:12.160
and even threatened to take her to court.

16:12.160 --> 16:14.160
Sounds eerily similar, doesn't it?

16:14.160 --> 16:17.440
She even posted a comment on the video five years ago,

16:17.440 --> 16:19.360
well before the H3 situation.

16:19.360 --> 16:20.000
On top of this,

16:20.000 --> 16:24.160
she also said how although she found Matt to be a fairly unpleasant person,

16:24.160 --> 16:27.520
he wasn't the awkward quirk that he often depicted in his work,

16:27.520 --> 16:30.400
and that there was a degree of separation from himself

16:30.400 --> 16:32.240
and the character in the presentation,

16:32.240 --> 16:33.520
although not in their goal,

16:33.520 --> 16:36.480
as Matt was quick to offer to take her out after shooting.

16:36.480 --> 16:37.120
On top of this,

16:37.120 --> 16:40.400
Anika also believed the character that Hoss created

16:40.400 --> 16:42.400
was made to appeal to a demographic,

16:42.400 --> 16:46.000
a very specific one that she herself claimed to receive flak from.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.240
I believe that with this knowledge we can apply

16:48.240 --> 16:51.040
and create a theory that suggests Matt was quite aware

16:51.040 --> 16:53.040
of the sort of content that he was making,

16:53.040 --> 16:57.440
and upon realising the potential sought to protect its image at all costs,

16:57.440 --> 16:59.440
whether it was attacking larger YouTubers,

16:59.440 --> 17:01.120
or even the people who worked with him,

17:01.120 --> 17:03.280
and actually gave him their time.

17:03.280 --> 17:06.080
So we bring this back to Ethan and Ela's content.

17:06.080 --> 17:09.760
What it did was basically turn Hoss' video into a bit of a joke,

17:09.760 --> 17:10.720
and that annoyed him,

17:10.720 --> 17:11.760
we can all agree on that,

17:11.760 --> 17:15.520
but in my opinion he wasn't annoyed because it personally insulted him,

17:15.520 --> 17:20.480
because it put his content into a box where shelf life had been cut criminally short.

17:20.480 --> 17:21.280
In my opinion,

17:21.280 --> 17:24.240
he wanted these videos to do well for the right reasons,

17:24.240 --> 17:27.360
and he knew that when Ethan and Ela uploaded their video,

17:27.360 --> 17:29.920
those reasons were evaporating rather quickly.

17:29.920 --> 17:33.200
In the tone of what he created following the filing of the lawsuit,

17:33.200 --> 17:37.280
it almost portrayed this guy who was deeply insecure in what he was creating,

17:37.280 --> 17:39.840
and someone who viewed themselves as under attack.

17:39.840 --> 17:43.120
When really the lawsuit in my opinion was a tactical move,

17:43.120 --> 17:45.920
I think he was completely aware of his character,

17:45.920 --> 17:47.840
but he knew there was a demographic for it.

17:47.840 --> 17:51.280
The thing is, the internet brings together those sorts of people.

17:51.280 --> 17:55.280
Matt wanted to create a world where the creepy awkward weirdo wins the girl,

17:55.280 --> 17:58.000
and when Ethan and Ela ran a very different narrative,

17:58.000 --> 18:00.480
he knew that the brand was on borrowed time,

18:00.480 --> 18:03.360
that he'd become some kind of ironic joke.

18:03.360 --> 18:04.160
So here we are,

18:04.160 --> 18:07.920
we have H3 creating a mockery out of the content that you love,

18:07.920 --> 18:11.200
and Hoss, legally speaking, is up against it.

18:11.280 --> 18:15.040
In a way, fair use is considered to be a prevailing thing,

18:15.040 --> 18:17.520
and H3 isn't your everyday creator,

18:17.520 --> 18:20.400
you can't just strike down the channel without anyone noticing,

18:20.400 --> 18:25.280
so he had to stop H3, or perhaps sacrifice everything that he had worked for,

18:25.280 --> 18:27.360
from his perspective at least.

18:27.360 --> 18:29.360
And this is where we address the lawsuits.

18:29.440 --> 18:39.440
The Lawsuit

18:39.440 --> 18:42.560
The lawsuit itself was handled very interestingly by Hoss.

18:42.560 --> 18:45.920
See, he went in with an author which included the clause that

18:45.920 --> 18:47.600
they never talk about him again,

18:47.600 --> 18:50.960
and he asked for the total of $3,750,

18:50.960 --> 18:54.000
which you know, although is substantial money in my opinion,

18:54.000 --> 18:58.160
Hoss considered that amount to be the sort of money that H3 might compromise on,

18:58.160 --> 19:03.600
and the money itself was probably for damage to what he considered to be his brand's reputation.

19:03.600 --> 19:07.200
Another point that I believe helps is the additional compromise that he offered,

19:07.200 --> 19:08.960
as shown in H3's clip here.

19:28.160 --> 19:44.320
H3 went into this under the impression that it wouldn't have to be taken to court.

19:44.320 --> 19:47.600
H3 made the point that setting the standards was the concern,

19:47.600 --> 19:51.920
but Hoss himself wasn't interested in that, he was interested in preservation.

19:51.920 --> 19:55.040
Ethan and Hila said that they had already promoted his content,

19:55.040 --> 19:56.880
and that was true, but that's the thing,

19:56.880 --> 20:00.240
they had promoted it in a way that had contradicted what it stood for.

20:00.240 --> 20:03.120
Ethan and Hila, when they were watching that content,

20:03.120 --> 20:06.960
and many viewers, assumed that it was just some guy doing wacky parkour,

20:06.960 --> 20:08.480
out in his own little world,

20:08.480 --> 20:11.280
but what they'd actually done was publicise content

20:11.280 --> 20:15.280
that had very different intentions for what they had interpreted it as.

20:15.280 --> 20:18.720
However, this message that I personally think Hoss promoted in the videos

20:18.720 --> 20:20.880
about the creepy guy getting the girl,

20:20.880 --> 20:22.640
although seemingly obvious,

20:22.640 --> 20:24.960
was often one that was somewhat subliminal,

20:24.960 --> 20:30.960
and its appeal to the audience relied on them not outwardly acknowledging their interests,

20:30.960 --> 20:32.640
ones that are rather twisted,

20:32.640 --> 20:36.160
and therefore having a pair of comedians explicitly interpreted

20:36.160 --> 20:37.760
in a completely different way,

20:37.760 --> 20:40.800
undermined that slight message that Hoss was trying to push,

20:40.800 --> 20:44.400
and therefore by retaining the serious credibility of his content

20:44.400 --> 20:48.480
in a promotion by H3 that would have been very different to their original video,

20:48.480 --> 20:51.600
he would have been able to continue making what he wanted to,

20:51.600 --> 20:53.280
rather than being a laughing stock.

20:53.280 --> 20:56.320
With that said, if H3 had made that promotional video,

20:56.320 --> 20:59.280
I think it would have been rather embarrassing for Hoss given the response,

20:59.280 --> 21:03.040
and I think he misinterpreted how people may have responded to that.

21:03.040 --> 21:06.720
You see, many people see Hoss as a reactionary who lashed out,

21:06.720 --> 21:09.760
and make no mistake, he probably has that side to him,

21:09.760 --> 21:12.800
but at the same time, the lawsuit itself was very calculated,

21:12.800 --> 21:17.520
and clearly represented what he thought was a threat to his own content and interpretation.

21:17.520 --> 21:20.400
Now as mentioned earlier, Hoss was the face of the lawsuit,

21:20.400 --> 21:21.760
and that's a real difference,

21:21.760 --> 21:25.600
when he realised that this probably wasn't going to be resolved in the initial stage,

21:25.600 --> 21:26.880
he switched game plan.

21:26.880 --> 21:31.120
One very interesting incident was this one, as documented by Ethan and Hila.

21:31.120 --> 21:34.080
Also worth mentioning, that was particularly obnoxious,

21:34.080 --> 21:36.640
is that while we were in negotiations for everything,

21:37.360 --> 21:40.400
that one night when he was just real angry and bitter,

21:40.400 --> 21:42.880
he, on a privated video that was already removed,

21:42.880 --> 21:44.640
I guess he still had the URL,

21:44.640 --> 21:46.880
and he did a strike, he did a takedown on our video,

21:46.880 --> 21:50.160
when we were in good faith negotiations just because he wanted to up us.

21:50.160 --> 21:55.280
However, I personally find it rather implausible that Hoss just flew into some spontaneous rage

21:55.280 --> 21:56.320
and struck the video,

21:56.320 --> 22:01.520
I much more find it plausible that he did that with the intention to provoke backlash onto himself,

22:01.520 --> 22:04.720
so that he would subsequently receive hate from angry H3 fans,

22:04.720 --> 22:06.960
which he would then use to fuel his case,

22:06.960 --> 22:11.440
firstly in his own content, and subsequently as reflected in the lawsuit itself.

22:12.560 --> 22:13.360
I'm impressed.

22:14.080 --> 22:18.080
If you look at the numbers, those are two very successful hashtags.

22:19.040 --> 22:20.880
You didn't spell my name on one of them though,

22:20.880 --> 22:22.880
but I could hurt you when they searched for the hashtag.

22:22.880 --> 22:27.040
Hoss was completely aware of the court's ignorance of most of the internet culture,

22:27.040 --> 22:31.840
and I think he realised that if he could paint himself to be a victim of harassment convincingly enough,

22:31.840 --> 22:35.280
he would be able to prove a point that his character had been defamed,

22:35.280 --> 22:37.600
as by proof he was receiving so much hate,

22:37.600 --> 22:41.200
and by documenting the success of the comments and their vitriol,

22:41.200 --> 22:44.080
he could then use them as a case going forward.

22:44.080 --> 22:46.800
Hoss was always up against it, and I think he knew that,

22:46.800 --> 22:48.960
but I feel like he didn't want to back down,

22:48.960 --> 22:52.320
that he wanted to keep on that notion that he always wins,

22:52.320 --> 22:54.160
the fact that he always got the girl,

22:54.160 --> 22:58.000
and therefore by striking the video a seemingly inconsequential act,

22:58.000 --> 23:01.520
he had it documented and riled up the people, H3 included.

23:01.520 --> 23:04.560
He was prepared for that hate, and he used it to his advantage.

23:04.560 --> 23:07.600
He followed the extreme hate comment video up with another video

23:07.600 --> 23:09.360
specifically addressed in the situation,

23:09.360 --> 23:12.880
and branding basically everyone who was against him as liars.

23:12.880 --> 23:14.480
He knew people hated him,

23:14.480 --> 23:18.640
but equally he knew that the courts wouldn't really care about his reputation.

23:18.640 --> 23:21.120
Hoss saw this as an all or nothing moment,

23:21.120 --> 23:25.280
either he ends up being the walking parkour meme that H3 made him out to be,

23:25.280 --> 23:27.600
and be confined within that narrative,

23:27.600 --> 23:31.040
or end their careers and scare away future commentators.

23:34.000 --> 23:37.600
With that said, I think he really passed the point of no return

23:37.600 --> 23:39.520
after initiating the lawsuit,

23:39.520 --> 23:43.200
and who knows how the public would have responded if he'd won the case,

23:43.200 --> 23:46.080
but either way, he wanted to finish what he started.

23:46.080 --> 23:50.800
You see, this is where Hoss welded the ideas of the character and himself together,

23:50.800 --> 23:52.400
overtly for the first time.

23:52.400 --> 23:55.840
So when he was attacked, he turned it into this personal issue,

23:55.840 --> 23:58.320
and thus used the attacks against him as evidence.

23:58.320 --> 24:00.480
He suddenly switched to commentary content,

24:00.480 --> 24:02.240
which is naturally more personal,

24:02.240 --> 24:04.800
and tried to walk this very weird line of connecting

24:04.800 --> 24:07.920
his on-screen persona with his personality.

24:07.920 --> 24:12.080
The one I'm voting for is Jill Stein, of the Green Party.

24:12.800 --> 24:15.440
I mean, come on, if you're a straight male or a lesbian,

24:15.440 --> 24:18.880
and you're looking for a Gilf, Jill's the one you want.

24:18.880 --> 24:20.960
Even in ways that made very little sense,

24:20.960 --> 24:23.760
and didn't link up to how other people had viewed him before.

24:23.760 --> 24:27.920
H3 themselves, despite understanding the difference between fiction and reality,

24:27.920 --> 24:31.120
as expressed in many videos, such as their recent one on Seinfeld,

24:31.120 --> 24:35.360
decided by assumption that Bolgai's personality represented Matt Hoss.

24:35.360 --> 24:37.120
But it didn't necessarily,

24:37.120 --> 24:39.920
Bolgai just represented a character from a film,

24:39.920 --> 24:42.160
a short film from The Twisted Mind.

24:42.160 --> 24:44.800
What you'll find interesting now is how,

24:44.800 --> 24:46.800
in spite of loving the hate at the time,

24:46.800 --> 24:49.120
Hoss has now removed basically all comments,

24:49.120 --> 24:53.040
and is clearly very carefully vetting the sections on how he is presented,

24:53.040 --> 24:54.800
particularly on his newer videos.

24:54.800 --> 24:56.960
They all have exceptionally low numbers of comments,

24:56.960 --> 24:59.760
and Hoss hasn't actually put an approval filter on it.

24:59.760 --> 25:02.640
No, he just removed 99% of comments.

25:02.640 --> 25:05.520
I know this because I tested it by leaving a comment,

25:05.520 --> 25:08.560
and it immediately went up, and he then favoured it.

25:08.560 --> 25:09.280
Cheers Matt.

25:09.280 --> 25:11.840
He's clearly very eager to move forward with his channel,

25:11.840 --> 25:15.280
and distance himself from the image portrayed by H3's content,

25:15.280 --> 25:18.000
and in my opinion, the hanging legacy over it all

25:18.000 --> 25:20.720
is the reason why he's probably delayed uploading again.

25:20.720 --> 25:23.600
This mattered much more than just a personal affront,

25:23.600 --> 25:25.280
that Hoss lashed out again.

25:25.280 --> 25:28.320
In my opinion, Hoss is a calculated individual.

25:28.320 --> 25:29.760
From the first days of his content,

25:29.760 --> 25:34.320
he blatantly changed it to create a brand identifiable with a certain demographic,

25:34.320 --> 25:38.480
and to appeal to a specific audience through that very specific branding,

25:38.480 --> 25:41.040
something that the sporadic online personality

25:41.040 --> 25:43.520
that people often framed him as, wouldn't do.

25:43.520 --> 25:45.040
If he was a Tommy Wiseau,

25:45.040 --> 25:45.760
Oh hi Mark,

25:45.760 --> 25:46.960
like fully in that sense,

25:46.960 --> 25:50.960
he wouldn't have necessarily cared whether that content was marketable or not,

25:50.960 --> 25:51.760
but he did.

25:51.760 --> 25:54.400
He always set up a very specific character arc,

25:54.400 --> 25:57.600
and not one that necessarily reflected him as a person.

25:57.600 --> 26:01.680
The threat H3 posed was not that it threatened the perception of him as a person,

26:01.680 --> 26:04.080
because although he certainly is a character,

26:04.080 --> 26:06.000
Bold Guy was not Matt Hoss.

26:06.000 --> 26:09.200
No, it was because it threatened the perception of his brand,

26:09.200 --> 26:12.720
one that he had fine-tuned to cast to a particular group of people,

26:12.720 --> 26:14.960
in my opinion, perhaps incels even,

26:14.960 --> 26:16.960
and his response was not one of reflex,

26:16.960 --> 26:21.680
but one that would seek to preserve that established reputation as much as possible,

26:21.680 --> 26:24.720
which unfortunately for him, H3 called him out on,

26:24.720 --> 26:26.400
publicised the incident further,

26:26.400 --> 26:29.040
and likely pushed that reputation over the edge.

26:29.040 --> 26:30.080
But even at that point,

26:30.080 --> 26:32.160
it didn't stop him from trying a few tricks,

26:32.160 --> 26:34.720
and making it look like a personal attack,

26:34.720 --> 26:36.240
by changing up his content,

26:36.240 --> 26:38.640
and integrating it very uncomfortably.

26:38.640 --> 26:42.560
Unfortunately, these tactics were futile when it came down to the matter of law,

26:42.560 --> 26:47.040
whether he'll be able to bring back that audience with all this legacy hanging over him,

26:47.040 --> 26:48.240
is another question,

26:48.240 --> 26:51.120
but I believe he's a bit more grounded than people think,

26:51.120 --> 26:55.520
and underestimating people's calculated nature is something we should never do.

26:55.520 --> 26:59.120
Matt Hoss is a shark in the water, waiting to strike,

26:59.120 --> 27:03.120
and I feel that maybe during the situation people were paying more attention to that.

27:03.120 --> 27:05.680
This isn't to say I think Matt Hoss is a genius, far from it,

27:05.680 --> 27:09.440
but I find the portrayal of him as some sort of clumsy and reactionary villain,

27:09.440 --> 27:11.680
one that is a bit inaccurate.

27:11.680 --> 27:13.120
Reflected in the lawsuit,

27:13.120 --> 27:16.960
I see it as much more of a calculated power play,

27:16.960 --> 27:22.240
one where he wanted to show himself as the guy who wins in the end,

27:22.240 --> 27:25.200
and to impress that sect of audience who admired him,

27:25.200 --> 27:26.560
the people who wanted him to win,

27:26.560 --> 27:29.840
to show that he is the guy who gets the girl at the end of the day,

27:29.840 --> 27:31.200
and yet he failed,

27:31.200 --> 27:33.520
perhaps undermining his whole reputation.

27:33.520 --> 27:36.080
I mean, can you see him doing political commentary?

27:36.080 --> 27:38.720
And that's where Republicans and Democrats are,

27:38.720 --> 27:41.040
two different flavors of the same thing.

27:41.680 --> 27:43.520
What we need is at least a third option,

27:44.800 --> 27:45.840
like a pineapple.

27:46.480 --> 27:47.840
Ah, neat.

27:47.840 --> 27:50.320
Just don't put that on a pizza, bastards.

27:51.200 --> 27:52.880
So that was the video,

27:52.880 --> 27:54.400
a lot of hard work into this one,

27:54.400 --> 27:55.840
I'd love to hear your thoughts on it.

27:55.840 --> 27:58.640
Matt Hoss' motivations are really unclear,

27:58.640 --> 28:02.480
and honestly, the aim of this video was just to prevent an alternative perspective,

28:02.480 --> 28:04.960
it's not one that I necessarily think is correct,

28:04.960 --> 28:07.440
but I thought it was a really interesting angle to take it,

28:07.440 --> 28:11.280
and I would love to hear what people think about his motivations in the comments below.

28:11.280 --> 28:13.760
On top of that, I want to give a big shout out to the editors,

28:13.760 --> 28:15.520
they have done a fantastic job,

28:15.520 --> 28:17.680
I'm gonna leave their links in the pinned comment,

28:17.680 --> 28:19.040
go and check them out.

28:19.040 --> 28:21.600
Also, a big shout out to my Patreons,

28:21.600 --> 28:23.280
some of them on screen right now,

28:23.280 --> 28:25.200
lovely, lovely people, thank you so much,

28:25.200 --> 28:27.920
and a special thanks to Ryan, you beautiful man,

28:27.920 --> 28:29.200
you are insane.

28:29.200 --> 28:31.280
I don't know why you do it, but you do it for me,

28:31.280 --> 28:32.400
and that's what matters.

28:32.400 --> 28:35.040
As an extra here, I have to give a shout out to Connor

28:35.040 --> 28:37.760
for his $50 donation to my Patreon,

28:37.760 --> 28:39.440
once again, incredibly generous,

28:39.440 --> 28:41.040
I really appreciate it, my friend,

28:41.040 --> 28:42.320
I really appreciate it.

28:42.320 --> 28:44.000
My throat is still dying.

28:44.000 --> 28:45.520
If you wanna speak to me about this,

28:45.520 --> 28:47.360
Twitter, at the right opinion,

28:47.360 --> 28:49.040
Facebook, Discord,

28:49.040 --> 28:50.000
they work too,

28:50.000 --> 28:52.240
you know, whatever tickles your fancy.

28:52.240 --> 28:53.760
I don't really have too much else to say,

28:53.840 --> 28:55.760
I'm pretty knackered as it is,

28:55.760 --> 28:57.280
but I hope you enjoyed the video,

28:57.280 --> 28:59.680
and I hope it provided something a bit more spicy,

28:59.680 --> 29:02.640
because I wanted to do something a bit more different this time,

29:02.640 --> 29:04.080
and it was a hard one,

29:04.080 --> 29:05.520
it was a hard theory to put forward,

29:05.520 --> 29:07.840
especially when you're dealing with a lot of hypotheticals,

29:07.840 --> 29:10.720
but something about Matt Hoss always did just kind of

29:10.720 --> 29:13.200
throw me off about his character presentations,

29:13.200 --> 29:15.680
which I think presents an ulterior motivation,

29:15.680 --> 29:18.000
but we can have that discussion another time.

29:18.000 --> 29:19.840
Until then, I'm The Right Opinion,

29:19.840 --> 29:21.360
and I will see you in the next one.
