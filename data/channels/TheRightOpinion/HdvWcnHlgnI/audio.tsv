0	10640	Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time,
10640	15640	and today I've decided to cover a topic that I've always wanted to, and I feel that time is now,
15640	20640	because chances are, when this video comes out, I'll be away on holiday, and won't have the chance to cover any
20640	25640	topics that are necessarily trending, but I have to say, out of all the people I've covered on this channel,
25640	31840	I think there are few people more intriguing than the person I've decided to cover today, and that person is Matt Hoss.
31840	36840	And if you're wondering who he is, well, you shouldn't be, but he is infamous amongst the internet community
36840	44120	for suing Ethan and Hila Klein, aka H3H3 Productions, over a reaction video they made on their second channel,
44120	50360	known as The Big, The Bold, The Beautiful, in which they delivered their signature reaction style commentary.
50360	55160	When I was a very small commentator, I made a little video called Matt Hoss Could Win,
55200	59960	in which I expressed my feelings on the whole lawsuit, and how in fact he could be successful.
59960	65560	At the time, fair use was still a very untested concept, and there had been cases in the past where creators had
65560	71720	lost against claimants, so I was especially sceptical of how some out of touch court might handle the case.
71720	77360	I think it was a justified concern, and at the end of the video, your sister snapped and went off on a memorable rant
77360	81680	that today would make such a typically placid individual like myself cringe.
81680	87920	That video was really the first taste of any success I had, as it amassed approximately 50,000 views at the time,
87920	93080	and I was pretty excited, I mean, what would this spell for an aspiring commentator like myself?
93080	97760	Well, basically nothing for another year, as all my videos afterwards didn't do much,
97760	104880	but I guess today, like Chris Martin once said, we're going back to the start, because I do find Matt Hoss a fascinating bloke.
104880	110400	Matt Hoss' channel is known as The Matt Hoss Zone, he did used to have an Instagram, but that's gone,
110400	114920	and he's been relatively inactive on all platforms, bar the occasional appearance on Facebook,
114920	120080	where he expresses his distaste of Donald Trump, and promises his inevitable return to the followers
120080	123640	who are eagerly awaiting another masterpiece from the Maestro himself.
123640	130240	As a creator, he is fairly established, running on the platform for a few years with a fairly respectable backlog of content.
130240	136440	His description reads, original comedy, action, horror, and fantasy short films, with electronic dance music,
136480	142080	for the mind of Matt Hossainzadeh, Hossainzadeh being his full last name, which you know, he has mercifully shortened,
142080	146440	so I appreciate that. It's probably going to knock around 10 minutes off this video.
146440	152680	The original comedy, action, horror, and fantasy short films were a mix of him picking up girls with his mad parkour,
152680	160640	with some vampires thrown in there, I mean, that's a simplification, but I think a lot of people tend to look at his content as Matt.
160680	169120	There is no other way to describe his channel other than, it's Matt Hoss, unfiltered Matt Hoss, like the room was unfiltered Tommy Wiseau,
169120	175120	but I'm not so sure about that. This is where H3 are introduced, most people know how the story goes,
175120	181280	that basically Matt filed a civil action against H3 under the premise that their use of content wasn't there,
181280	186200	and defamed his character. H3 disputed this, and this then escalated to the courts.
186320	192360	Fortunately, this time round, the judge then, Catherine Forrest, the absolute legend, ruled in favour of the Clines.
192360	199720	It was probably one of the most famous motions, and it was heartwarming to see an often divided community uniting for the cause of something
199720	205840	that transcended the differences. Matt Hoss, the man at the centre of this lawsuit, became the sort of Disney villain of YouTube.
205840	211920	He himself was a content creator, and thus the lawsuit felt very personal. I spoke about this in my Smosh video,
211920	219920	but often when businesses file lawsuits, there is a lack of accountability. We'll hate the business, but they have no personality to hone in on,
219920	228400	they have no face to lambast. Matt Hoss put himself at the front and centre of the controversy, and there were very few people who were willing to defend him,
228400	235280	he didn't set himself out there as a likeable character. He often came across as highly egocentric and narcissistic,
235280	242520	and people tended to hone in on this. People hated him for it, and when videos came out, they were very critical of Matt Hoss in the moment,
242520	248920	but no one really asked why he did it, and in a way, when the situation is transpiring, I wouldn't expect people to.
248920	256160	The stakes seemed very high, and theorising over motivations when they weren't exactly relevant to the outcome seemed unnecessary,
256160	261200	but I feel like now that time has passed and we're all on the tubes, chilling, like the fellow kids we are,
261200	268480	I feel like maybe we do have time for a discussion, because as said, I really do find the character of Hoss a very captivating one.
268480	274400	I think many people at the time just saw him as this delusional reactionary, completely high off his own hubris,
274400	282160	and with this image in his head that he was under personal attack. And you know, when you look at the evidence, it's 100% credible,
282160	290960	and one that I even may agree with to an extent, but I want to have a discussion because I think there was a level of calculation that many people do not pay attention to,
290960	296400	and I want to watch his videos so we can perhaps understand the mind and motivations of Matt Hoss.
296400	302080	I'm someone who likes to find rationale and logic in everything, and although I accept that it's not always the case,
302080	309520	it's hard to believe that in spite of these slightly blurred lines of fair use, that Matt Hoss would end up likely throwing copious amounts of money away
309520	314520	to protect some semblance of personal reputation which he tried to reflect in his rhetoric.
314520	319600	That makes very little sense to me, and I want to see if we can find an alternative explanation.
319640	326720	There are a lot of details pre and post Lawsuit that I think can perhaps present a case that is very different to the one we assume as truth,
326720	333920	and I hope maybe I can provide a new take to an old situation, but to do that we have to cut the crap and enter the Matt Hoss zone,
333920	342400	which is a zone like no other, so I suggest we light up the fuse, burn it up, because at The Right Opinion, we go hard, and never go home.
342400	344880	Ready, set, go.
349600	360160	The Matt Hoss character is a very interesting one, and one that does seem to be pretty consistent throughout his content.
360160	365360	Apart from these social commentaries, which is another barrel of fish that we'll have to knock over in a bit,
365360	372320	what happens is that you have this protagonist, namely our hero, Daddy Matt here, bold guy typically,
372320	376320	and what we see is him swooping in on this girl, the alpha male that he is.
376400	381840	Often this girl will play hard to get, be difficult, and not comply with Hoss's obvious advances,
381840	386880	however you see Matt Hoss isn't easily defeated, and will persist until he has the female.
386880	392880	The first video that he has up is a video known as Flirt, he did have one up before that was called In Blood,
392880	399520	however it has been taken down, but one can assume that that was more of the horror themed content that he was looking at,
399600	405360	and Flirt is much more to a formula, Hoss moves in, girl says no, Matt Hoss translates as yes,
405360	408720	and goes at it until she gives in to his manly charms.
421040	426160	See, where me and H3 disagree is that I don't think Matt Hoss is some old school cringe tube,
426160	430480	I think he's one of those corners of the internet that people say they've been to once,
430480	434960	and come back from, and aren't really interested in checking it out a second time.
434960	444160	It seems like it once again appeals to a select set of people who are looking to fulfil their position of being able to place themselves as the protagonist,
444160	449040	and live out their dreams of picking up a girl by telling her that basically they want to vore them,
449040	451360	that's what this is, dressed up vore.
451440	456480	The thing is, that on one hand this presents the delusion that many people associated Hoss with,
456480	462960	many people saw Hoss as someone trying to basically express himself through content in unrealistic situations,
462960	467280	but equally this could just be a clever appeal to the audience in my opinion.
467280	474160	Hoss makes the very interesting directorial decision to make the girl's responses fairly realistic most of the time,
474160	481120	that rather than just to have her immediately jump on his dick, which would say to me something much more about self gratification.
481120	486000	Like many rational people, the subject of his video typically becomes very uncomfortable,
486000	492400	and asks him to go away, continuously, insults him, seems absolutely disgusted like any reasonable person would,
492400	495920	and yet at the end of it suddenly has this incredible epiphany,
495920	502000	and decides that actually this guy who is continuously insinuated to sexually beating you to a pulp,
502000	505920	and removing various body parts might just be the man of her dreams.
506000	511040	Now when he first started out, he had these sorts of arthouse titles such as Flirt,
511040	513920	and the highly anticipated sequel, Flirt 2.
513920	517680	His thumbnails were pretty clickbaity, and they involved the famed female,
517680	520560	which you know, is always a good method to attract attention.
520560	523200	These videos were performing alright for his channel size,
523200	527920	but it wasn't until a significant change in these videos that they began to catch fire,
527920	529600	which was the titles.
529600	532160	Suddenly the videos were not just Flirt or Flirt 2,
532160	535680	they were videos that depicted occurrences in the present tense,
535680	541520	which are always naturally more clickbaity, and played off the double meaning of a quote, bold guy.
541520	546320	These videos really picked up, often accumulating hundreds of thousands of views.
546320	550800	Another couple details that I found interesting was how his original description read,
550800	553280	short films from my twisted brain,
553280	557920	and there were videos that now have been removed which looked like they didn't actually include him.
557920	562880	Also, massive shout out to Emblazon HD, hope that Minecraft channel takes off mate.
562880	566000	And so the question becomes, why did he remove those videos?
566000	570000	I mean, it wasn't views, as they seem to be comparatively doing alright,
570000	574400	so I suppose we could say that he wanted to make his channel more about his characters,
574400	576160	and narratively coherent,
576160	580000	and I can understand why that may motivate him to remove those videos,
580000	583280	but the videos he removed showed a difference in creativity,
583280	586320	some sort of disconnect between the artist and the art,
586320	588080	and that's what I find interesting.
588080	593680	It's clear that Hoss took the decision to see Matt Hoss's zone as more integral to himself as the person,
593680	598560	but when he started it out, when he conceptualised it, he didn't look at it that way.
598560	602240	It begs the question, how much self-awareness was actually there?
602240	605200	Was there more self-awareness than we typically assumed?
605200	610720	And if so, why would he present the content as lacking so much self-awareness, supposedly?
610720	613440	Let's put these ideas on hold and move forward.
613440	617040	With the removal of content that we assume he considered irrelevant
617040	620640	to the progress of his channel, this left him with two key series,
620640	622320	Bold Guy and Horny Tony.
622320	624640	Bold Guy was known for his hilarity,
624640	625360	charisma,
625360	626160	and boldness,
626160	629440	and Horny Tony was known, well, for his horniness.
629440	632560	Both of these brands have serious sexual undercurrents,
632560	635920	and it's certainly not the sort of films you'd view on prime time television,
635920	639760	and it's quite amazing that his character hasn't been hashtag me too yet.
639760	643200	Basically, it seems like content tailored for incels,
643200	647600	the idea that somehow you can be just absolutely strange and repulsive,
647600	651280	and somehow end up with the girl, and that's what has been confusing me.
651280	655600	Matt Hoss writes the characters around him as completely aware of that,
655600	658240	and yet every time he seems to end up winning the girl,
658240	660480	sending a very mixed message to his audience,
660480	666000	it seems like some psychological tactic to present some very deluded part of the viewership,
666000	668640	with this unrealistic character to hold onto.
668640	673120	I think Matt Hoss is 100% aware of his character's unlikeability,
673120	675840	however when we make short films like Matt Hoss does,
675840	679680	we don't expect them to be character representations of ourselves,
679680	683680	and yet everyone assumed his characters like Bold Guy to be just that,
683680	686480	mainly because he often seemed to aggrandise the character
686480	689360	in a way that would somewhat represent that delusion,
689360	692480	using words in his description such as cool and funny.
692480	696080	Cool and funny, Bold Guy, doing epic parkour.
696080	697520	This was your protagonist,
697520	702080	but at the same time there was such an awareness of how transparently terrible he was,
702080	705280	I can only think that he was trying to appeal to a set of individuals
705280	706800	who were also that terrible,
706800	709440	and looking for some sort of creation of a fantasy
709440	712240	where their crude behaviour is actually successful.
712240	715440	I feel Hoss was originally distant from the characters,
715440	718160	and demonstrated it through their old content,
718160	722160	and I think this shows a different perspective from a lot of the narratives created,
722160	724240	and I want to explain in the next part
724240	727440	why I think this has greater implications for the lawsuits.
732080	734080	CLIP
748560	750560	In one of his videos about the lawsuit,
750560	752800	Hoss says that he doesn't care about the hate,
752800	756000	and in fact he lives to thrive off the animosity.
756000	758640	Despite the enemy's propaganda,
758640	764720	I don't care about criticism or approval regarding how I conduct my business.
765760	767600	Not only do I not care,
767600	774400	I am proud to stand up against massive misguided opposition
774400	779440	to fight for my rights and the rights of artists everywhere.
779440	781680	I feel this isn't entirely true.
781680	783440	I think on one hand, sure,
783440	786400	he loves the attention that the whole situation gave him,
786400	787440	but on the other hand,
787440	791120	there was something deeply harmful about the incident that really vexed him,
791120	794720	which is what propelled him to launch the lawsuit in the first place.
794720	796960	I feel like many of us can agree on that,
796960	799440	however I think for me the false assumption came
799440	801680	that people assumed he launched the lawsuit
801680	804560	because he represented himself in his characters,
804560	807200	and therefore felt he was personally under attack.
807200	808560	After all, on one hand,
808560	812240	I think that's where the whole defamation point of view was introduced,
812240	814960	but personally I think that was more of a legal tactic
814960	817920	to try and strengthen a case which was kind of weak,
817920	819360	by putting himself out there,
819360	821440	exposing himself to all that negativity,
821440	825840	and then using that negativity to strengthen the persecution in his case.
825840	828800	However, at some point he completely filters his comments,
828800	832560	not in a way where you would have to wait for some admin approval to post,
832560	835840	just 99% of the comments are gone, with a few remaining.
835840	838960	This says to me that he might be making a return quite soon.
838960	841840	You see, I think his content relied on a clear image
841840	844160	being portrayed to a specific demographic,
844160	845120	and here's the thing,
845120	847360	it's clear that Hoss was no stranger to hate,
847360	848640	the ratings for his videos,
848640	850240	while he still had them enabled,
850240	852400	painted a fairly polarising picture,
852400	854800	but there was clearly some sort of audience,
854800	857840	and I'm sure many people attacked him personally in the past,
857840	860000	and some of those comments are still there.
860000	862880	So there must be something unique about the H3 video,
862880	863440	which you know,
863440	867280	you have to understand H3 to know what they can do with their brand,
867280	870560	the clients and their reaction videos have a way of impacting
870560	873200	how certain characters are viewed by an audience.
873200	875760	The thing about Bold Guy is that you view his videos
875760	877520	in the context of his arc,
877520	879360	and that creative output.
879360	882720	Ethan and Hila decontextualised his video in that sense,
882720	884320	and they had every right to.
884320	887840	However, they took it out of the world that Hoss wanted it to be shown in,
887840	888800	and in my opinion,
888800	891040	this is what concerned Hoss the most,
891040	894480	he had an idea of how his audience were viewing his character,
894480	896320	the fact that his appeal of his content
896320	899760	had been swayed in a different direction was what caught his eye.
899760	903200	Many people thought Hoss saw their portrayal as an affront to him,
903200	906800	but I think he was concerned about the greater popular implications
906800	908000	that followed the video,
908000	911920	for the character that he himself was not greatly invested in.
911920	913520	You see, with their reaction video,
913520	917440	I think what threatened Hoss above all was the implications from being memed
917440	918560	by Ethan and Hila,
918560	922320	the idea that the brand he created so finely was under threat.
922320	925440	You see, there are huge implications from being memed,
925440	928240	not only does it completely shift a public perception
928240	930480	of something that you may be taking seriously,
930480	932400	but if you can't transcend the meme,
932400	934720	then you know you're running on borrowed time.
934720	936000	Memes become boring,
936000	938000	if you cannot redefine yourself there,
938000	939840	then you will get lost in the vault.
939840	943200	Many people are under the impression that the Ethan and Hila situation
943200	946880	was the first time that he tried to silence someone over such pretenses,
946880	950400	but in fact I reached out to one of the actresses in his video
950400	953440	who was under a similar predicament, Anika Reitman.
953440	956720	She told me that Hoss refused to let her use any of the content,
956720	958240	not even for an acting reel,
958240	961440	despite the fact that she testified that they had collaborated heavily
961440	962720	on each part of the process,
962720	965360	and it was part of the agreement for her participation.
965360	968080	She tried to upload this acting reel onto her channel,
968080	969920	and he had her channel suspended,
969920	972160	and even threatened to take her to court.
972160	974160	Sounds eerily similar, doesn't it?
974160	977440	She even posted a comment on the video five years ago,
977440	979360	well before the H3 situation.
979360	980000	On top of this,
980000	984160	she also said how although she found Matt to be a fairly unpleasant person,
984160	987520	he wasn't the awkward quirk that he often depicted in his work,
987520	990400	and that there was a degree of separation from himself
990400	992240	and the character in the presentation,
992240	993520	although not in their goal,
993520	996480	as Matt was quick to offer to take her out after shooting.
996480	997120	On top of this,
997120	1000400	Anika also believed the character that Hoss created
1000400	1002400	was made to appeal to a demographic,
1002400	1006000	a very specific one that she herself claimed to receive flak from.
1006000	1008240	I believe that with this knowledge we can apply
1008240	1011040	and create a theory that suggests Matt was quite aware
1011040	1013040	of the sort of content that he was making,
1013040	1017440	and upon realising the potential sought to protect its image at all costs,
1017440	1019440	whether it was attacking larger YouTubers,
1019440	1021120	or even the people who worked with him,
1021120	1023280	and actually gave him their time.
1023280	1026080	So we bring this back to Ethan and Ela's content.
1026080	1029760	What it did was basically turn Hoss' video into a bit of a joke,
1029760	1030720	and that annoyed him,
1030720	1031760	we can all agree on that,
1031760	1035520	but in my opinion he wasn't annoyed because it personally insulted him,
1035520	1040480	because it put his content into a box where shelf life had been cut criminally short.
1040480	1041280	In my opinion,
1041280	1044240	he wanted these videos to do well for the right reasons,
1044240	1047360	and he knew that when Ethan and Ela uploaded their video,
1047360	1049920	those reasons were evaporating rather quickly.
1049920	1053200	In the tone of what he created following the filing of the lawsuit,
1053200	1057280	it almost portrayed this guy who was deeply insecure in what he was creating,
1057280	1059840	and someone who viewed themselves as under attack.
1059840	1063120	When really the lawsuit in my opinion was a tactical move,
1063120	1065920	I think he was completely aware of his character,
1065920	1067840	but he knew there was a demographic for it.
1067840	1071280	The thing is, the internet brings together those sorts of people.
1071280	1075280	Matt wanted to create a world where the creepy awkward weirdo wins the girl,
1075280	1078000	and when Ethan and Ela ran a very different narrative,
1078000	1080480	he knew that the brand was on borrowed time,
1080480	1083360	that he'd become some kind of ironic joke.
1083360	1084160	So here we are,
1084160	1087920	we have H3 creating a mockery out of the content that you love,
1087920	1091200	and Hoss, legally speaking, is up against it.
1091280	1095040	In a way, fair use is considered to be a prevailing thing,
1095040	1097520	and H3 isn't your everyday creator,
1097520	1100400	you can't just strike down the channel without anyone noticing,
1100400	1105280	so he had to stop H3, or perhaps sacrifice everything that he had worked for,
1105280	1107360	from his perspective at least.
1107360	1109360	And this is where we address the lawsuits.
1109440	1119440	The Lawsuit
1119440	1122560	The lawsuit itself was handled very interestingly by Hoss.
1122560	1125920	See, he went in with an author which included the clause that
1125920	1127600	they never talk about him again,
1127600	1130960	and he asked for the total of $3,750,
1130960	1134000	which you know, although is substantial money in my opinion,
1134000	1138160	Hoss considered that amount to be the sort of money that H3 might compromise on,
1138160	1143600	and the money itself was probably for damage to what he considered to be his brand's reputation.
1143600	1147200	Another point that I believe helps is the additional compromise that he offered,
1147200	1148960	as shown in H3's clip here.
1168160	1184320	H3 went into this under the impression that it wouldn't have to be taken to court.
1184320	1187600	H3 made the point that setting the standards was the concern,
1187600	1191920	but Hoss himself wasn't interested in that, he was interested in preservation.
1191920	1195040	Ethan and Hila said that they had already promoted his content,
1195040	1196880	and that was true, but that's the thing,
1196880	1200240	they had promoted it in a way that had contradicted what it stood for.
1200240	1203120	Ethan and Hila, when they were watching that content,
1203120	1206960	and many viewers, assumed that it was just some guy doing wacky parkour,
1206960	1208480	out in his own little world,
1208480	1211280	but what they'd actually done was publicise content
1211280	1215280	that had very different intentions for what they had interpreted it as.
1215280	1218720	However, this message that I personally think Hoss promoted in the videos
1218720	1220880	about the creepy guy getting the girl,
1220880	1222640	although seemingly obvious,
1222640	1224960	was often one that was somewhat subliminal,
1224960	1230960	and its appeal to the audience relied on them not outwardly acknowledging their interests,
1230960	1232640	ones that are rather twisted,
1232640	1236160	and therefore having a pair of comedians explicitly interpreted
1236160	1237760	in a completely different way,
1237760	1240800	undermined that slight message that Hoss was trying to push,
1240800	1244400	and therefore by retaining the serious credibility of his content
1244400	1248480	in a promotion by H3 that would have been very different to their original video,
1248480	1251600	he would have been able to continue making what he wanted to,
1251600	1253280	rather than being a laughing stock.
1253280	1256320	With that said, if H3 had made that promotional video,
1256320	1259280	I think it would have been rather embarrassing for Hoss given the response,
1259280	1263040	and I think he misinterpreted how people may have responded to that.
1263040	1266720	You see, many people see Hoss as a reactionary who lashed out,
1266720	1269760	and make no mistake, he probably has that side to him,
1269760	1272800	but at the same time, the lawsuit itself was very calculated,
1272800	1277520	and clearly represented what he thought was a threat to his own content and interpretation.
1277520	1280400	Now as mentioned earlier, Hoss was the face of the lawsuit,
1280400	1281760	and that's a real difference,
1281760	1285600	when he realised that this probably wasn't going to be resolved in the initial stage,
1285600	1286880	he switched game plan.
1286880	1291120	One very interesting incident was this one, as documented by Ethan and Hila.
1291120	1294080	Also worth mentioning, that was particularly obnoxious,
1294080	1296640	is that while we were in negotiations for everything,
1297360	1300400	that one night when he was just real angry and bitter,
1300400	1302880	he, on a privated video that was already removed,
1302880	1304640	I guess he still had the URL,
1304640	1306880	and he did a strike, he did a takedown on our video,
1306880	1310160	when we were in good faith negotiations just because he wanted to up us.
1310160	1315280	However, I personally find it rather implausible that Hoss just flew into some spontaneous rage
1315280	1316320	and struck the video,
1316320	1321520	I much more find it plausible that he did that with the intention to provoke backlash onto himself,
1321520	1324720	so that he would subsequently receive hate from angry H3 fans,
1324720	1326960	which he would then use to fuel his case,
1326960	1331440	firstly in his own content, and subsequently as reflected in the lawsuit itself.
1332560	1333360	I'm impressed.
1334080	1338080	If you look at the numbers, those are two very successful hashtags.
1339040	1340880	You didn't spell my name on one of them though,
1340880	1342880	but I could hurt you when they searched for the hashtag.
1342880	1347040	Hoss was completely aware of the court's ignorance of most of the internet culture,
1347040	1351840	and I think he realised that if he could paint himself to be a victim of harassment convincingly enough,
1351840	1355280	he would be able to prove a point that his character had been defamed,
1355280	1357600	as by proof he was receiving so much hate,
1357600	1361200	and by documenting the success of the comments and their vitriol,
1361200	1364080	he could then use them as a case going forward.
1364080	1366800	Hoss was always up against it, and I think he knew that,
1366800	1368960	but I feel like he didn't want to back down,
1368960	1372320	that he wanted to keep on that notion that he always wins,
1372320	1374160	the fact that he always got the girl,
1374160	1378000	and therefore by striking the video a seemingly inconsequential act,
1378000	1381520	he had it documented and riled up the people, H3 included.
1381520	1384560	He was prepared for that hate, and he used it to his advantage.
1384560	1387600	He followed the extreme hate comment video up with another video
1387600	1389360	specifically addressed in the situation,
1389360	1392880	and branding basically everyone who was against him as liars.
1392880	1394480	He knew people hated him,
1394480	1398640	but equally he knew that the courts wouldn't really care about his reputation.
1398640	1401120	Hoss saw this as an all or nothing moment,
1401120	1405280	either he ends up being the walking parkour meme that H3 made him out to be,
1405280	1407600	and be confined within that narrative,
1407600	1411040	or end their careers and scare away future commentators.
1414000	1417600	With that said, I think he really passed the point of no return
1417600	1419520	after initiating the lawsuit,
1419520	1423200	and who knows how the public would have responded if he'd won the case,
1423200	1426080	but either way, he wanted to finish what he started.
1426080	1430800	You see, this is where Hoss welded the ideas of the character and himself together,
1430800	1432400	overtly for the first time.
1432400	1435840	So when he was attacked, he turned it into this personal issue,
1435840	1438320	and thus used the attacks against him as evidence.
1438320	1440480	He suddenly switched to commentary content,
1440480	1442240	which is naturally more personal,
1442240	1444800	and tried to walk this very weird line of connecting
1444800	1447920	his on-screen persona with his personality.
1447920	1452080	The one I'm voting for is Jill Stein, of the Green Party.
1452800	1455440	I mean, come on, if you're a straight male or a lesbian,
1455440	1458880	and you're looking for a Gilf, Jill's the one you want.
1458880	1460960	Even in ways that made very little sense,
1460960	1463760	and didn't link up to how other people had viewed him before.
1463760	1467920	H3 themselves, despite understanding the difference between fiction and reality,
1467920	1471120	as expressed in many videos, such as their recent one on Seinfeld,
1471120	1475360	decided by assumption that Bolgai's personality represented Matt Hoss.
1475360	1477120	But it didn't necessarily,
1477120	1479920	Bolgai just represented a character from a film,
1479920	1482160	a short film from The Twisted Mind.
1482160	1484800	What you'll find interesting now is how,
1484800	1486800	in spite of loving the hate at the time,
1486800	1489120	Hoss has now removed basically all comments,
1489120	1493040	and is clearly very carefully vetting the sections on how he is presented,
1493040	1494800	particularly on his newer videos.
1494800	1496960	They all have exceptionally low numbers of comments,
1496960	1499760	and Hoss hasn't actually put an approval filter on it.
1499760	1502640	No, he just removed 99% of comments.
1502640	1505520	I know this because I tested it by leaving a comment,
1505520	1508560	and it immediately went up, and he then favoured it.
1508560	1509280	Cheers Matt.
1509280	1511840	He's clearly very eager to move forward with his channel,
1511840	1515280	and distance himself from the image portrayed by H3's content,
1515280	1518000	and in my opinion, the hanging legacy over it all
1518000	1520720	is the reason why he's probably delayed uploading again.
1520720	1523600	This mattered much more than just a personal affront,
1523600	1525280	that Hoss lashed out again.
1525280	1528320	In my opinion, Hoss is a calculated individual.
1528320	1529760	From the first days of his content,
1529760	1534320	he blatantly changed it to create a brand identifiable with a certain demographic,
1534320	1538480	and to appeal to a specific audience through that very specific branding,
1538480	1541040	something that the sporadic online personality
1541040	1543520	that people often framed him as, wouldn't do.
1543520	1545040	If he was a Tommy Wiseau,
1545040	1545760	Oh hi Mark,
1545760	1546960	like fully in that sense,
1546960	1550960	he wouldn't have necessarily cared whether that content was marketable or not,
1550960	1551760	but he did.
1551760	1554400	He always set up a very specific character arc,
1554400	1557600	and not one that necessarily reflected him as a person.
1557600	1561680	The threat H3 posed was not that it threatened the perception of him as a person,
1561680	1564080	because although he certainly is a character,
1564080	1566000	Bold Guy was not Matt Hoss.
1566000	1569200	No, it was because it threatened the perception of his brand,
1569200	1572720	one that he had fine-tuned to cast to a particular group of people,
1572720	1574960	in my opinion, perhaps incels even,
1574960	1576960	and his response was not one of reflex,
1576960	1581680	but one that would seek to preserve that established reputation as much as possible,
1581680	1584720	which unfortunately for him, H3 called him out on,
1584720	1586400	publicised the incident further,
1586400	1589040	and likely pushed that reputation over the edge.
1589040	1590080	But even at that point,
1590080	1592160	it didn't stop him from trying a few tricks,
1592160	1594720	and making it look like a personal attack,
1594720	1596240	by changing up his content,
1596240	1598640	and integrating it very uncomfortably.
1598640	1602560	Unfortunately, these tactics were futile when it came down to the matter of law,
1602560	1607040	whether he'll be able to bring back that audience with all this legacy hanging over him,
1607040	1608240	is another question,
1608240	1611120	but I believe he's a bit more grounded than people think,
1611120	1615520	and underestimating people's calculated nature is something we should never do.
1615520	1619120	Matt Hoss is a shark in the water, waiting to strike,
1619120	1623120	and I feel that maybe during the situation people were paying more attention to that.
1623120	1625680	This isn't to say I think Matt Hoss is a genius, far from it,
1625680	1629440	but I find the portrayal of him as some sort of clumsy and reactionary villain,
1629440	1631680	one that is a bit inaccurate.
1631680	1633120	Reflected in the lawsuit,
1633120	1636960	I see it as much more of a calculated power play,
1636960	1642240	one where he wanted to show himself as the guy who wins in the end,
1642240	1645200	and to impress that sect of audience who admired him,
1645200	1646560	the people who wanted him to win,
1646560	1649840	to show that he is the guy who gets the girl at the end of the day,
1649840	1651200	and yet he failed,
1651200	1653520	perhaps undermining his whole reputation.
1653520	1656080	I mean, can you see him doing political commentary?
1656080	1658720	And that's where Republicans and Democrats are,
1658720	1661040	two different flavors of the same thing.
1661680	1663520	What we need is at least a third option,
1664800	1665840	like a pineapple.
1666480	1667840	Ah, neat.
1667840	1670320	Just don't put that on a pizza, bastards.
1671200	1672880	So that was the video,
1672880	1674400	a lot of hard work into this one,
1674400	1675840	I'd love to hear your thoughts on it.
1675840	1678640	Matt Hoss' motivations are really unclear,
1678640	1682480	and honestly, the aim of this video was just to prevent an alternative perspective,
1682480	1684960	it's not one that I necessarily think is correct,
1684960	1687440	but I thought it was a really interesting angle to take it,
1687440	1691280	and I would love to hear what people think about his motivations in the comments below.
1691280	1693760	On top of that, I want to give a big shout out to the editors,
1693760	1695520	they have done a fantastic job,
1695520	1697680	I'm gonna leave their links in the pinned comment,
1697680	1699040	go and check them out.
1699040	1701600	Also, a big shout out to my Patreons,
1701600	1703280	some of them on screen right now,
1703280	1705200	lovely, lovely people, thank you so much,
1705200	1707920	and a special thanks to Ryan, you beautiful man,
1707920	1709200	you are insane.
1709200	1711280	I don't know why you do it, but you do it for me,
1711280	1712400	and that's what matters.
1712400	1715040	As an extra here, I have to give a shout out to Connor
1715040	1717760	for his $50 donation to my Patreon,
1717760	1719440	once again, incredibly generous,
1719440	1721040	I really appreciate it, my friend,
1721040	1722320	I really appreciate it.
1722320	1724000	My throat is still dying.
1724000	1725520	If you wanna speak to me about this,
1725520	1727360	Twitter, at the right opinion,
1727360	1729040	Facebook, Discord,
1729040	1730000	they work too,
1730000	1732240	you know, whatever tickles your fancy.
1732240	1733760	I don't really have too much else to say,
1733840	1735760	I'm pretty knackered as it is,
1735760	1737280	but I hope you enjoyed the video,
1737280	1739680	and I hope it provided something a bit more spicy,
1739680	1742640	because I wanted to do something a bit more different this time,
1742640	1744080	and it was a hard one,
1744080	1745520	it was a hard theory to put forward,
1745520	1747840	especially when you're dealing with a lot of hypotheticals,
1747840	1750720	but something about Matt Hoss always did just kind of
1750720	1753200	throw me off about his character presentations,
1753200	1755680	which I think presents an ulterior motivation,
1755680	1758000	but we can have that discussion another time.
1758000	1759840	Until then, I'm The Right Opinion,
1759840	1761360	and I will see you in the next one.
