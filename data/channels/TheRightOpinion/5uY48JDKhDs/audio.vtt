00:00.000 --> 00:13.860
Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too

00:13.860 --> 00:17.660
much free time, and businesses on YouTube. Whether we like it or not, they're here

00:17.660 --> 00:22.340
to stay, and in many cases, I try not to view their presence as a wholly negative one. It's

00:22.340 --> 00:26.560
important to remember that one of our primary purposes as creators is to bring entertainment

00:26.560 --> 00:30.300
to those who use the platform, and if a channel can do that, whoever it's run by, then we

00:30.300 --> 00:34.580
can broadly agree that it's a net positive for audiences. Businesses will always occupy

00:34.580 --> 00:39.020
a realm of YouTube, and I do believe there can be a peaceful coexistence. At the same

00:39.020 --> 00:42.980
time, there will always be tension. To be honest, it's understandable why more grassroots

00:42.980 --> 00:47.140
creators feel unnerved by their presence. Businesses have so much more power and resources

00:47.140 --> 00:51.240
at their fingertips to outflank independent YouTubers in many aspects of quality control.

00:51.240 --> 00:54.900
They can create high production pieces in a few days that would take an individual upwards

00:54.900 --> 00:58.600
of a month, bombing the algorithm with a myriad of content that often gives what many

00:58.600 --> 01:03.120
would perceive an unfair advantage to them against the humble creator. When market domination

01:03.120 --> 01:07.120
comes from a few large corporations, the outcome for the consumer is generally not particularly

01:07.120 --> 01:10.920
positive. It leads to less diversity in general, and more control of narratives by a select

01:10.920 --> 01:14.560
few people, and in industries that are already prone enough to corruption, it's anything

01:14.560 --> 01:18.380
but healthy. YouTube was built on the notion of allowing a person to broadcast themselves

01:18.380 --> 01:21.840
without the necessary investment of a larger business so they didn't have to dance to

01:21.840 --> 01:25.260
anyone's tunes, and many people would like to keep it that way. Fortunately, there will

01:25.260 --> 01:29.060
always be people who will occupy these spaces regardless of their market success, but at

01:29.060 --> 01:33.220
the same time, it's still good to have individual figures in influential positions who can represent

01:33.220 --> 01:37.100
a human aspect to content creation, and although businesses have certainly made more inroads

01:37.100 --> 01:40.140
on the platform than they used to, there will always be that window of authenticity that

01:40.140 --> 01:44.620
seems to separate many of them from the personally driven passion projects. The truth is, one

01:44.620 --> 01:49.340
thing that is hard to fabricate is that individual enthusiasm one has for a subject they cover,

01:49.340 --> 01:53.480
and although not impossible, many large businesses simply don't see it as a required component

01:53.480 --> 01:58.760
for success, and as channels like Looper, Minit Crafts, whatever they're called, and

01:58.760 --> 02:03.080
the rest have shown, you really don't need that much framework on personality to succeed.

02:03.080 --> 02:06.860
In fact, avoiding building any personal image ensures that they keep any components that

02:06.860 --> 02:11.120
may change disposable, and that ultimately, control of the content is still centralised

02:11.120 --> 02:14.960
on the people who run the channel, and not those they may outsource a variety of the

02:14.960 --> 02:18.480
work to. This formula means that there is a boundary before more independent content

02:18.480 --> 02:22.620
and more detached corporate presentations, however, just because there's a rule doesn't

02:22.620 --> 02:27.360
mean that there aren't exceptions, particularly in the community we're focusing on today.

02:27.360 --> 02:31.480
Commentary is genre that large corporations tend to avoid infiltrating, particularly given

02:31.480 --> 02:35.880
the aforementioned paragraph. Having a personality is almost essential to the content you're

02:35.880 --> 02:39.780
producing, even if you're merely presenting information, viewers expect at least a little

02:39.780 --> 02:43.620
pizzazz. Audience members want to build a relationship based on trust with the person

02:43.620 --> 02:46.680
they're listening to, how can you do that when you don't even know if there's a real

02:46.680 --> 02:50.080
person behind the channel? However, this doesn't mean that there aren't some willing

02:50.080 --> 02:54.720
to take the risk, and one subgenre of commentary knows this all too well, that being the Tea

02:54.720 --> 02:55.720
community.

02:55.720 --> 03:01.880
A popular YouTube channel is about to hit 1 million subscribers, they showed up, out

03:01.880 --> 03:06.760
of nowhere, almost a year ago, and the people want to know, who is Spill?

03:06.760 --> 03:10.600
A few years ago, there was a drama in the community that surrounded a channel called

03:10.600 --> 03:14.880
Spill. Spill is a channel that hosts numerous videos with high production value and an astonishing

03:14.880 --> 03:19.400
upload schedule given those said videos. They also hosted a syndicate of channels alongside

03:19.400 --> 03:24.360
Spill, including Brew, Grill, and On The Hill. I'll speak more about them in the future,

03:24.360 --> 03:28.600
but a video they uploaded covering their origin at the time had made them seem more homegrown

03:28.600 --> 03:29.760
than they actually were.

03:29.760 --> 03:34.680
Spill started out as a two-person passion project, one of us has a background in journalism,

03:34.680 --> 03:39.100
the other has a background in illustration and video editing. We both love YouTube news

03:39.100 --> 03:43.720
and drama, who doesn't? We wanted to create a channel that had a more journalistic approach

03:43.720 --> 03:49.200
to YouTube drama, a thorough recap of all sides of a story with proper citations. On

03:49.200 --> 03:53.900
top of that, we wanted to give something back to the community by contributing to the conversation

03:53.900 --> 03:58.360
with an educational approach. And while a lot of people choose to do creative projects

03:58.360 --> 04:02.960
while being self-employed, as soon as more than one person is working on a big project

04:02.960 --> 04:07.000
together, it's legally the best option to register as a corporation.

04:07.000 --> 04:11.360
The reality was that Spill and their accompanying channels were part of a larger company that

04:11.360 --> 04:15.040
had branched out into the tea community, and although people involved with the channel

04:15.040 --> 04:18.480
were actually quite interested in the stories that they covered, they weren't exactly

04:18.480 --> 04:22.600
how they portrayed themselves, and that gave some in the community reason for pause.

04:22.600 --> 04:36.360
Spill- So my question to you is pretty simple, who are you going to believe? Spill saying

04:36.360 --> 04:41.200
that the corporation was a reaction to their 2018 YouTube channel growing, or the Canadian

04:41.240 --> 04:44.420
government saying that this corporation has been around since 2013.

04:44.420 --> 04:47.440
The tea community appeared to be a target for companies and content farms who had been

04:47.440 --> 04:51.200
looking for a way to capitalise on the evident draw of commentary channels. What makes tea

04:51.200 --> 04:55.240
channels so attractive to businesses though? Well, I think it's because they often integrate

04:55.240 --> 04:59.400
reporting a factual or speculative information in a rather straightforward manner. It's

04:59.400 --> 05:02.920
not difficult to grasp, but in cases like Spill, all they had to do was attempt to cut

05:02.920 --> 05:06.960
out bias from the reporters themselves. So although the channel felt like a tea channel,

05:06.960 --> 05:11.960
it was more over a news channel covering tea topics with a nice presentation, and any

05:11.960 --> 05:16.280
attempts to add personality such as their grill channel have not attracted that much

05:16.280 --> 05:20.540
attention because of it. With that in mind, the Spill family hasn't taken up too much

05:20.540 --> 05:24.480
space despite their impressive collective size, and other up and coming creators have

05:24.480 --> 05:29.320
still been able to carve out a niche for themselves, one of those being the subject of today, a

05:29.320 --> 05:42.640
channel by the name of Anna Oop. Anna Oop is a tea channel who has grown to be one of

05:42.640 --> 05:46.080
the most influential creators in her sphere, with over 2 million subscribers on her main

05:46.080 --> 05:50.240
channel and nearly 4 million subscribers when counting her other channels, focusing more

05:50.240 --> 05:51.240
on true crime.

05:51.240 --> 05:55.400
Did you guys ever see any of the TikTok videos about Isabella? What did you think when you

05:55.400 --> 05:59.240
saw them? I can't wait to read your thoughts and discussions down in the comments below.

05:59.240 --> 06:03.480
Her all-American girl charm and sassy nature is well complemented by editing with real

06:03.480 --> 06:07.300
personality behind it, resulting in content that appears to have captured the hearts of

06:07.300 --> 06:11.400
many viewers, with her true crime content garnering popularity for being a bite-sized

06:11.400 --> 06:15.960
accessible breakdown of often very complex cases. All in all, she seems to be the prime

06:15.960 --> 06:19.960
example of individual success in the face of a climate that is becoming more and more

06:19.960 --> 06:24.420
demanding of creators, with thousands tuning into her channels every day to hear that voice

06:24.420 --> 06:28.140
and the person behind it. But what's there more to this humble 21 year old than meets

06:28.140 --> 06:31.900
the eye? Well, today we're going to be doing some investigating of our own, following Anna

06:31.900 --> 06:35.820
Oop's timeline, and seeing whether this success story was really as organic as it

06:35.820 --> 06:41.020
seemed. Ladies, gentlemen, and all other colours on the light spectrum, let's look into the

06:41.020 --> 06:55.780
mystery of inventing Anna Oop.

06:55.780 --> 07:00.500
The YouTube channel for Anna Oop was created in May 2019, it's hard to re-say too much

07:00.500 --> 07:04.180
about them at this point as many of their videos from back then were deleted, and I

07:04.180 --> 07:07.980
do want to save a bit of information for later, but I think from the off Anna knew what sort

07:07.980 --> 07:11.780
of creator she wanted to be, particularly with a name like that, which refers to a popular

07:11.780 --> 07:21.180
meme that regularly circulates around the beauty and other communities.

07:21.180 --> 07:24.660
The video started off quite modestly, with a star that was similar to many other tea

07:24.660 --> 07:28.540
channels at the time, content that delivered information in a mostly verbally free text

07:28.540 --> 07:32.540
format over copyright free soundtracks, being interspersed with the relevant clips of the

07:32.540 --> 07:36.340
discourse. The topics she chose were also those which were long established to have

07:36.340 --> 07:40.540
proven dividends for creators, these subjects mostly included large influences and even

07:40.540 --> 07:45.500
celebrities such as Ariana Grande or Bretman Rock. Not all of these videos were necessarily

07:45.500 --> 07:49.560
unbiased or journalistic, some of them were heavily opinionated, such as her videos on

07:49.560 --> 08:03.020
Nikita Dragun.

08:03.020 --> 08:06.540
These are all important aspects to building an individual's relationship with an audience,

08:06.540 --> 08:09.940
whether it be positive or negative. There are people who like Nikita Dragun, there are

08:09.940 --> 08:13.620
people who do not like Nikita Dragun, but having people who care is already half the

08:13.620 --> 08:17.460
battle to engage with them with your videos. Such content drives up engagement and encourages

08:17.460 --> 08:21.720
people to like, dislike, and leave their comments. However, if you're only known to be a dedicated

08:21.720 --> 08:25.140
hater, then you're not really going to build much potential with your viewers, your takes

08:25.140 --> 08:29.440
still need to be somewhat reasonable and elaborated from their point of view, and Anna Oop did

08:29.440 --> 08:33.600
that for many people. Her strong skills in production, conveying digestible if lightweight

08:33.600 --> 08:38.280
information garnered her an audience very quickly, and when I say very quickly, I mean

08:38.280 --> 08:39.920
nearly immediately.

08:39.920 --> 08:44.720
By the time December 2019 came around, Anna was already approaching 50,000 subscribers,

08:44.720 --> 08:48.120
something that few creators could really dream of in the first eight months of their content

08:48.120 --> 08:51.680
creation. But subscribers weren't the only thing she was building, most importantly,

08:51.680 --> 08:55.080
she was building a rapport with those who viewed her, and she knew the importance of

08:55.080 --> 08:58.480
this. She'd regularly advertise her Twitter and Instagram so she could prevent fanart

08:58.520 --> 09:02.120
of herself, and was seemingly an active member of the community at this time, talking with

09:02.120 --> 09:05.880
audience members and fellow creators. She had a few gimmicks as well, the most interesting

09:05.880 --> 09:09.820
one was calling her viewers, and people she interacted with love, and intentional misspelling

09:09.820 --> 09:14.320
of a word that could mean a term of endearment in certain places. They were building a persona

09:14.320 --> 09:19.000
with identifiable yet unique characteristics, and people were tuning in for them, yet there

09:19.000 --> 09:20.960
was more work to be done.

09:20.960 --> 09:24.760
Heading into the new year of 2020, Anna seemed determined to take her channel to the next

09:24.760 --> 09:29.040
level, and in January, she switched from the commonly used text format to using her own

09:29.040 --> 09:32.360
voice. Normally, you'd think there would be more of an announcement, or at least some

09:32.360 --> 09:36.660
build up to such a change in format, you'd think there could be some attention in a voice

09:36.660 --> 09:40.880
reveal at least, but it seems that Anna didn't want to make a scene, and I can't blame

09:40.880 --> 09:45.560
her for that. The first documented video to use her voice is the upload on Nikki's tutorials,

09:45.560 --> 09:49.160
and given the subject, Anna's sombre tone appears to be appropriate.

09:49.160 --> 09:53.640
Of course, many people are all pretty mad about this, and want to know who did this

09:53.640 --> 09:58.740
to Nikki. There's been a lot of speculations, and some people are even accusing famous YouTubers,

09:58.740 --> 10:02.560
and some of Nikki's closest friends. There were even rumours that one of the blackmailers

10:02.560 --> 10:07.520
was the company Too Faced, who had previously manipulated Nikki into going into a deal with

10:07.520 --> 10:09.240
them where she lost millions.

10:09.240 --> 10:13.740
Although at first Anna Oop's delivery on subjects appears quite subdued, with each

10:13.740 --> 10:18.060
passing month she seemed to find more and more zest when covering these topics, gradually

10:18.060 --> 10:22.220
transforming into the more bold and brash character people are familiar with today.

10:22.220 --> 10:26.060
However, it wasn't just what was being said on YouTube that was important to Anna, and

10:26.060 --> 10:29.900
throughout the year she said about many ways that would familiarise the viewers with her

10:29.900 --> 10:30.900
as a person.

10:30.900 --> 10:35.900
Hi loves, your girl is back again. So today we're going to talk about Tana Mongeau's

10:35.900 --> 10:41.260
infamous reality TV show on MTV, and y'all, this show really ain't it.

10:41.260 --> 10:46.100
In Spring 2020, Anna's existing Twitter account was deleted, seemingly suspended, and a number

10:46.140 --> 10:49.260
of videos were purged from her channel. The reason being somewhat unknown, as many of

10:49.260 --> 10:53.420
these videos weren't exactly poorly performing, but it seemed to work, as the summer of 2020

10:53.420 --> 10:56.700
found Anna increasing her view and subscriber count at breakneck pace.

10:56.700 --> 11:01.280
However, she wasn't without her challenges. In May 2020, Anna's channel was demonetised

11:01.280 --> 11:05.840
by YouTube, who cited unoriginal content being the reason Anna took to Twitter to dispute

11:05.840 --> 11:09.620
this, highlighting the amount of work that she puts into her channel. Given the amount

11:09.620 --> 11:13.660
of second-hand material used by T channels, this isn't a rare occurrence, as YouTube

11:13.660 --> 11:17.680
often struggles to distinguish the two. Anna also used her platform to stick up for another

11:17.680 --> 11:21.460
creator who found themselves in a similar situation. She also found the time to be outspoken

11:21.460 --> 11:27.060
in support for social causes such as BLM, the Lebanon crisis, and LGBT rights, characterising

11:27.060 --> 11:31.380
them as causes that meant a lot to her. She'd post memes, provide opinions, celebrate her

11:31.380 --> 11:35.900
birthday which was on the 12th of July, and even hosted a Twitter Q&A, all of which enabled

11:35.900 --> 11:39.480
her to build a closer relationship with her viewers. Some of her answers were a little

11:39.480 --> 11:43.500
non-descript, but you can't expect a creator to be comfortable with giving all their personal

11:43.500 --> 11:47.860
details out to the public. With that said, her favourite film series is The Hunger Games,

11:47.860 --> 11:52.260
her favourite animal is a koala bear, and her favourite game is Roblox. They weren't

11:52.260 --> 11:56.780
surprising details, but they were meaningful to those who supported her, and her personality

11:56.780 --> 11:58.460
only became more iconic.

11:58.460 --> 12:03.840
Anna Oop In the space of barely a year and a half, Anna

12:03.840 --> 12:08.420
Oop had transformed the landscape of the T community into one suitable for her. Her strong

12:08.420 --> 12:12.420
production value and excellent upload schedule paired with an identifiable character major

12:12.420 --> 12:16.020
a force to be reckoned with, and Anna knew the importance of retaining people who cared

12:16.020 --> 12:20.620
about her. She wanted people to get to know her for who she was, and she wanted people

12:20.620 --> 12:25.100
to know her appreciation for them, even occasionally tweeting out love and gratitude to those who

12:25.100 --> 12:29.460
helped her find success in an often challenging industry. However, Anna was number one to

12:29.460 --> 12:33.620
rest on her laurels. In fact, her success had only made her more ambitious, and on the

12:33.620 --> 12:37.060
3rd of December, she tweeted out that she was working on a new channel that she thought

12:37.060 --> 12:39.320
her viewers were going to love.

12:39.320 --> 12:44.120
What was Anna Oop cooking? Well, we're about to find out.

12:44.120 --> 12:48.380
Anna Oop Not every case is the same, and plenty of

12:48.380 --> 12:52.280
unsolved cases still desperately need to be solved.

12:52.280 --> 13:00.560
True Crime It's really hard to think of a more significant

13:00.560 --> 13:04.440
development to the YouTube community in the last few years than that of the true crime

13:04.440 --> 13:08.840
genre. Now, true crime has always possessed a presence in mainstream media, it long pre-existed

13:09.360 --> 13:12.720
YouTube, and will probably long outlast it. However, the storytelling aspect appears to

13:12.720 --> 13:16.700
have taken its grasp in the last few years, with many creators garnering millions of subscribers

13:16.700 --> 13:20.400
for their coverage of criminal cases, solved and unsolved. There's always been a bit

13:20.400 --> 13:24.120
of stigma around the inclusion of such topics, particularly given the fact that it's being

13:24.120 --> 13:28.560
published to potentially millions of people, and some would rather have it out of the spotlight.

13:28.560 --> 13:32.640
Nonetheless, the consensus seems to be that if these topics are treated with the due amount

13:32.640 --> 13:36.280
of respect, then there is a place for them. Interestingly, there seems to be a decent

13:36.280 --> 13:40.400
overlap between tea and beauty communities, and true crime, with some true crime creators

13:40.400 --> 13:44.400
having beauty roots, with some still integrating it into their videos, and it seems that Anna

13:44.400 --> 13:48.560
pertained that same penchant for the morbid. It was clear that by the end of December,

13:48.560 --> 13:59.240
her new channel was going to be true crime related. The first video was uploaded on the

13:59.240 --> 14:03.240
5th of January, it followed the story of a TikToker who had slain his neighbours for

14:03.240 --> 14:08.400
It was a suitably macabre topic, though Anna's voice does take a bit of getting used to in

14:08.400 --> 14:12.480
this context. Honestly, she sounded more bad when she was talking about Nicky tutorials.

14:12.480 --> 14:16.280
According to Zach's public defence lawyers, the video shows her telling the neighbours

14:16.280 --> 14:19.700
to get off their property. She told them that they'd better back up, because they were

14:19.700 --> 14:23.800
not going to like what's coming out of the house. Sounds like a threat, right?

14:23.800 --> 14:27.160
Nonetheless, the video was well received, and accumulates a strong view count, with

14:27.160 --> 14:32.080
the channel approaching 100,000 subscribers in the space of a few days, a surprising statistic

14:32.080 --> 14:36.080
all things considered, but it must have reflected the strong cult of personality that someone

14:36.080 --> 14:40.280
like Anna Oop had built, and in the next months, she continued to upload consistently on the

14:40.280 --> 14:43.840
Anna Solve channel. Pretty impressive considering that she still had her main channel to run

14:43.840 --> 14:48.000
as well, and in spite of what may have appeared as time constraints, she also managed to maintain

14:48.000 --> 14:52.200
an upload schedule on there as well. Fortunately, most of these videos were limited to approximately

14:52.200 --> 14:56.200
10 minutes at most, which likely allowed her to divide her time fairly evenly between the

14:56.200 --> 14:59.360
two projects. However, although she was still experiencing growth on her main channel, the

14:59.360 --> 15:02.960
true crime one appeared to be experiencing the greatest proportional success, accruing

15:02.960 --> 15:07.720
over 300,000 subscribers by the time April came around. Now, such impressive statistics,

15:07.720 --> 15:10.840
you might expect one to consolidate their achievements, and focus on how to make sure

15:10.840 --> 15:14.900
that such levels of commitment can be preserved, but Anna had different ideas, and on June

15:14.900 --> 15:19.140
of the same year, launched another channel, this one called Anna Horror Stories, which

15:19.140 --> 15:24.080
as the name implies, comprises of Anna recounting the rather unnerving tales of others, that

15:24.080 --> 15:27.200
recently has pivoted towards more list-style content.

15:27.200 --> 15:31.360
Nonetheless, another channel, I mean, I respect the commitment to the grind, but it seems

15:31.360 --> 15:35.520
like a lot to keep at, though, to be fair, this channel's content didn't seem the highest

15:35.520 --> 15:39.600
effort either. The writing is someone else's, and the footage is pretty standard, Anna may

15:39.600 --> 15:43.600
have just been looking to make a pretty penny. However, barely a couple weeks after the first

15:43.600 --> 15:48.120
upload on this channel, Anna was back on Twitter again, polling people for her next channel,

15:48.120 --> 15:51.260
asking what a good name would be, and quote tweeting another person saying that this would

15:51.260 --> 15:55.280
be looking more into the psychological side of criminal behaviour. On the surface, it's

15:55.280 --> 15:59.580
not unfeasible, but it's certainly surprising given Anna has no apparent background in criminal

15:59.580 --> 16:03.800
psychology, she already has a true crime channel, and more than enough on her plate to worry

16:03.800 --> 16:07.840
about. It seemed like a lot to be planning ahead for, when she barely had any opportunity

16:07.840 --> 16:11.680
to gauge the amount of time she'd be able to balance between her already active three

16:11.680 --> 16:16.320
channels and an additional fourth one, but maybe she really was just that inspired.

16:16.320 --> 16:20.200
However, this idea appeared to stagnate a little, and developments over the coming months

16:20.200 --> 16:23.740
stalled, with a tweet at the start of September explaining that her lack of activity on social

16:23.740 --> 16:27.500
media was due to some personal stuff she'd been going through, and with all things considered

16:27.500 --> 16:32.000
this was understandable. Her status as a large influencer had landed her in some drama, probably

16:32.000 --> 16:36.140
the most notable example of this was her feud with that vegan teacher, a controversial figure

16:36.140 --> 16:40.560
whose promotion of veganism has been overshadowed by her altercations with other online figures,

16:40.560 --> 16:42.300
and accompanying contentious remarks.

16:42.300 --> 16:53.440
Anna's responses weren't the most intellectual, sometimes merely consisting to the genius

16:53.440 --> 16:57.880
content of eating a burger, but that vegan teacher was an easy target, and it allowed

16:57.880 --> 17:20.120
Anna to repeatedly dunk on a person who'd already been widely lampooned by the internet.

17:20.120 --> 17:24.240
If I found this drama interesting, I'd probably say more, but it at least established a more

17:24.240 --> 17:28.640
queen side to Anna Oop, and persisted for the rest of the year. Although drama isn't

17:28.640 --> 17:32.440
known to be the most fun to be involved in, Anna seemed to capitalise on the opportunity

17:32.440 --> 17:36.200
to make sassy comments about all those who were hating on her, all while continuing to

17:36.200 --> 17:40.640
upload consistently on her channels, and initiating work on other projects, including launching

17:40.640 --> 17:44.960
a Roblox channel which would allow audiences to game with her. Additionally, she finally

17:44.960 --> 17:48.480
launched the Anna Uncovered channel, the first video being uploaded at the end of November

17:48.480 --> 18:04.520
with a runtime of 18 minutes.

18:04.520 --> 18:09.720
However, the zenith of her online career appeared to be approaching in December of 2021.

18:09.720 --> 18:13.760
There had long been questions about the person behind Anna Oop's channel, and a face reveal

18:13.760 --> 18:18.800
had long been sought after by the most dedicated viewers of her channel. Anna teased this before,

18:18.800 --> 18:23.520
but with her hitting 2 million subscribers, it felt like a celebration was in order. Anna

18:23.520 --> 18:28.000
continued to drop a variety of hints and clues to all that would be revealed, seemingly with

18:28.000 --> 18:33.040
a song titled Face Reveal, which really could only imply one thing, especially given the

18:33.040 --> 18:37.240
teaser trailers that were posted by Anna herself. Finally, people would have a face to put to

18:37.240 --> 18:41.600
this commentator, and viewers were excited, but on the 3rd of December, the video for

18:41.600 --> 18:58.640
Face Reveal was uploaded, and people were in shock.

18:58.640 --> 19:28.240
What the fuck was that?

19:28.240 --> 19:31.380
Anna Oop's Face Reveal contains a series of call-outs to other creators who she has

19:31.380 --> 19:35.280
previously clashed with and spoken about, but the only person really being the subject

19:35.280 --> 19:39.840
of any criticism during this video was her. Face Reveal was broadly ridicule for its sub-par

19:39.840 --> 19:44.020
production quality and delivery, but also for the simple fact that it did not contain

19:44.020 --> 19:48.360
a face reveal. In the video itself, Anna says she wishes she could, but clearly felt that

19:48.360 --> 19:52.200
it was not the appropriate time, and later expands on this on Twitter, saying that she

19:52.200 --> 19:56.280
was going to, but afraid that she would have to deal with too much negativity. I don't

19:56.280 --> 20:00.540
understand, I suppose, but why would you make a video titled Face Reveal in the first

20:00.540 --> 20:05.240
place then, if the whole point of it was not to reveal your face? Well, Anna said she thought

20:05.240 --> 20:08.880
it was just gonna be a fun little goof. It's hard to buy that someone as algorithmically

20:08.880 --> 20:13.720
adept as Anna would not know the implications of advertising a face reveal on an otherwise

20:13.720 --> 20:17.740
faceless channel, but maybe this stress from other drama had just impacted her judgement

20:17.740 --> 20:21.880
a little, and yet, a few days before this, she had just launched another channel?

20:22.280 --> 20:26.720
On top of this y'all, Anna Hoop is also known for her problematic personality. She's been

20:26.720 --> 20:31.720
in scandal after scandal, constantly getting into drama herself, I mean, I think it's

20:31.720 --> 20:34.320
about time we see Anna actually do a video on herse-

20:34.320 --> 20:35.320
Oh.

20:35.320 --> 20:38.960
This was just too much for one person, and surely she was spreading herself incredibly

20:38.960 --> 20:43.640
thin by doing so, and not too long after, this theory may well have been proven correct.

20:43.640 --> 20:47.040
Now there had always been stigma around Anna's channel, but a lot of the criticisms up to

20:47.040 --> 20:51.680
a point were quite subjective, her opinions were poorly formed, her attitude was annoying,

20:51.680 --> 20:55.640
and her content was clickbaiting. They may have all held some validity, but that doesn't

20:55.640 --> 20:59.360
tend to make a particularly eye-catching discussion to those outside of the sphere.

20:59.360 --> 21:03.360
However, a couple weeks after face reveal, Anna put out an interesting post on her Twitter

21:03.360 --> 21:07.040
and YouTube community tab, complaining that a person had copyright struck her without

21:07.040 --> 21:11.240
justification or ownership of content that she had been uploading. She also singled out

21:11.240 --> 21:14.920
the channel that had copyright struck her, a channel by the name of Truthful Reality,

21:14.920 --> 21:18.640
another true crime creator who had covered some of these same stories before Anna. On

21:18.640 --> 21:23.000
superficial inspection, one can't necessarily claim ownership of topics, and a strike on

21:23.000 --> 21:27.920
a channel for doing so would be wholly unjustified. However, as Anna's tweet and YouTube community

21:27.920 --> 21:32.100
post began to pick up traction, a growing backlash from viewers began to form, many

21:32.100 --> 21:36.400
of whom stating that Truthful Reality had claimed footage that he personally owned and

21:36.400 --> 21:41.480
published solely, and Anna had directly lifted this without any transformative value, not

21:41.480 --> 21:46.000
quite the story that Anna had told. Viewers also did not appreciate the fact that Anna

21:46.000 --> 21:50.420
linked his channel, and although not accompanied by any direct call to action, the risk of

21:50.420 --> 21:54.600
harassment from an emotionally charged post like this was always present, with some even

21:54.600 --> 21:58.360
claiming that Anna had purposefully ignored any chance to peacefully resolve this matter

21:58.360 --> 22:03.160
privately, only now taking umbrage after actions were taken against her channel. I suppose

22:03.160 --> 22:07.000
it's in the nature of some more irreverent people in the community to behave this way,

22:07.000 --> 22:11.400
but this is Anna's soul, not Anna Oop, and many people who are part of these communities

22:11.400 --> 22:16.460
think that respect is an inherent part of creating content in this genre, but that appeared

22:16.460 --> 22:18.120
to be just the tip of the iceberg.

22:18.120 --> 22:23.420
About a few days before all this, a post had gone up on Reddit entitled Anna Oop aka Anna

22:23.420 --> 22:27.780
Solve's At It Again, which documented the alleged plagiarism from a YouTuber named Mr.

22:27.780 --> 22:32.000
Ballum, a channel with millions of subscribers. It was clear that this video had been removed

22:32.000 --> 22:35.280
very promptly from Anna's channel following call-outs from commenters, and any of its

22:35.280 --> 22:39.560
presence had been long erased. Additionally, about a few days after the Anna Solve channel

22:39.560 --> 22:43.200
went live, a couple of comments appeared on her Twitter requesting her to refrain from

22:43.200 --> 22:47.720
stealing content. That was in January, and now we were in December. It seems that rumours

22:47.720 --> 22:51.360
have been circulating regarding stolen content on this channel for a while, but it only seemed

22:51.360 --> 22:55.640
to surface when Anna herself decided to publicly attack another creator for what they perceived

22:55.640 --> 23:00.440
as an unjust copyright strike. I can't really comment on the legality of the copyright strike,

23:00.440 --> 23:04.720
as it can be a very grey area, but it definitely shone a light on what many perceived to be

23:04.720 --> 23:09.200
extensively lazy reporting from a creator who was not actually putting time into these

23:09.200 --> 23:13.640
cases that they deserved. Claims of plagiarism are not that common, particularly given that

23:13.640 --> 23:17.440
the cases themselves can be sourced from a lot of places, so this occurring twice in

23:17.440 --> 23:21.960
the span of a very short time was a red flag for some viewers. Some of the concerns appeared

23:21.960 --> 23:25.800
to address the idea that Anna didn't pronounce the names of people involved correctly, and

23:25.800 --> 23:29.560
regularly made errors in reporting information. This is all important in the narrative of

23:29.560 --> 23:33.620
stolen content, as a person who lifts content may not be familiar with the subject enough

23:33.620 --> 23:37.960
to possess this knowledge, and will therefore make errors in reporting the actual details,

23:37.960 --> 23:41.080
copying content, without actually understanding the subtext.

23:41.080 --> 23:46.480
Today, we're going to talk about Nikocado Avocado disrespecting Veronica Vang.

23:46.480 --> 23:50.960
I had come across this a few times when researching a few of Anna Oop's main channel videos,

23:50.960 --> 23:54.720
and tried not to pay too much mind to it, as I've made more than enough pronunciation

23:54.720 --> 23:58.640
and semantic errors in my time, but there was still something strange about certain

23:58.640 --> 24:03.240
mistakes that struck me off as somebody supposedly so involved in the beauty community. Like,

24:03.240 --> 24:06.800
how could you spell Jacqueline that way when you've literally used the correct spelling

24:06.800 --> 24:10.900
in the title? It just didn't make sense. I'd read rumours that the reason for this

24:10.900 --> 24:15.040
was to drive up impressions by having people correct you in the comments, and although

24:15.040 --> 24:18.880
it's impossible to confirm, it's certainly something to consider with channels this supposedly

24:18.880 --> 24:22.880
deliberate, and particularly relevant with Anna's true crime channels, where such shortcomings

24:22.880 --> 24:25.640
could be perceived as seriously disrespectful.

24:25.640 --> 24:29.160
Given Anna Oop's upload schedule, it seems that her final choice was to drop the matter

24:29.160 --> 24:34.160
entirely and just create more videos, which she did. In fact, approaching the end of 2022,

24:34.160 --> 24:38.280
between her now five channels, she was uploading nearly every day. The tweet regarding truth

24:38.280 --> 24:42.100
for reality was deleted, and no content that was subject to the copyright claims was ever

24:42.100 --> 24:46.720
restored to her channel. However, this situation did place a mark over the genuinity of her

24:46.720 --> 24:51.280
content, and made people wonder how much of her channel was original. After all, it wouldn't

24:51.280 --> 24:55.360
be the first time that this was called into question. Anna Oop's videos were well produced,

24:55.360 --> 24:59.200
they looked nice, they had eye-catching titles and thumbnails, and love her or hate her,

24:59.200 --> 25:03.760
Anna had a personality that provoked a response from audiences. She had a lot going for her,

25:03.760 --> 25:07.840
it wouldn't have taken that much to do just a bit more research to avoid errors and any

25:07.840 --> 25:11.480
risk of lifting other people's content. Yet all that was being put on the line for

25:11.480 --> 25:15.440
videos that Anna didn't need or have to create. It didn't make sense for a person

25:15.440 --> 25:21.100
to behave this way, it didn't make sense for a person to behave this way. Anna's face

25:21.100 --> 25:26.440
reveal may not have gone exactly as many would have expected it to, but by the end of 2021,

25:26.440 --> 25:30.480
many felt they had a better view of Anna Oop's face than they ever did before, with some

25:30.480 --> 25:35.840
wondering whether there even was a face in the first place. Well, it wasn't long before

25:35.840 --> 25:42.320
alternative theories began emerging, alongside some pretty damning evidence.

25:42.320 --> 25:46.800
Now the trail of breadcrumbs seem to point out to this channel, who we are going to lovingly

25:46.800 --> 25:52.000
call Team Anna Hoopoo-Poo-Poo-Poo-Poo-Poo-Poo-Poo-Poo.

26:00.480 --> 26:07.000
Now there are always theories floating around surrounding the identity of Anna Oop, not

26:07.000 --> 26:10.620
necessarily people wishing to have all her personal details, who are asking the question

26:10.620 --> 26:15.520
whether she really was a legitimate individual content creator. However, without real evidence

26:15.520 --> 26:19.560
proving one way or the other, all you could do was speculate. There are plenty of alternative

26:19.560 --> 26:24.240
explanations, perhaps Anna just outsources a large amount of her work and enjoys a feeling

26:24.240 --> 26:28.920
of being super productive, it's not impossible. Outsourcing doesn't necessarily undermine

26:28.920 --> 26:32.600
the individuality of a channel as long as they still have a personal connection to what

26:32.600 --> 26:37.600
they do. Maybe Anna Oop just really likes money or algorithmic success, they may not

26:37.600 --> 26:42.280
be the most noble reasons, but that also wouldn't change her personal identity or connection

26:42.280 --> 26:46.680
to the channel. Anna had once claimed to have watched old videos critical of her, even showing

26:46.680 --> 26:50.640
one which outwardly shows the thumbnail claiming her channel was a company, so she must have

26:50.640 --> 26:52.160
been aware of these discussions.

26:52.160 --> 26:57.020
Don't ask, I've already seen all the hate videos about me on YouTube, but let me remind

26:57.020 --> 27:00.860
you that my only job here is to entertain y'all, and that's why your girl decided

27:00.860 --> 27:02.940
to launch my new channel, AnnaPlays.

27:02.940 --> 27:07.340
However, the drama surrounding the copyright strike did ring a few alarm bells. A large

27:07.340 --> 27:11.380
majority of creators still want to be proud of the work they attach their brand name to,

27:11.380 --> 27:15.340
even if there are significant contributions from other parties, but Anna's posts seem

27:15.340 --> 27:20.260
to convey a lack of understanding of how this copyright strike even came about. They say

27:20.260 --> 27:25.040
it was for no reason at all. Even if you didn't edit the content yourself, the first thing

27:25.040 --> 27:29.520
you'd do is try and establish exactly why this happened. Anna is obviously aware this

27:29.520 --> 27:33.760
isn't just some random bloke or corporation trying to cash in on her content because she

27:33.760 --> 27:38.520
links his channel. This is another true crime YouTuber who probably cares about his reputation

27:38.520 --> 27:42.280
as well, so there was clearly some motive behind the strike, whether you think that

27:42.280 --> 27:47.080
was justified or not, but Anna couldn't put two and two together, which is very strange

27:47.080 --> 27:48.080
indeed.

27:48.080 --> 27:51.480
They had been murmuring since then that there was more to this story, including an earlier

27:51.480 --> 27:55.680
comment that alleged that Anna had ignored attempts to reconcile the matter in private,

27:55.680 --> 27:59.240
but ultimately the story appeared to fizzle out. However, there were other developments

27:59.240 --> 28:04.140
that were going on in the nearby drag race community that would throw the case wide open,

28:04.140 --> 28:05.840
so let's go there now briefly.

28:05.840 --> 28:11.840
Hey queens! Some people found this dig from Carmen to be a little out of line, because

28:11.840 --> 28:17.780
Gottmik's appearance on the show was a big deal. Regardless of the fact that Mick identifies

28:17.780 --> 28:21.940
as male, having a trans queen on the season was huge.

28:21.940 --> 28:26.280
This is Butterface, they're a channel that operates in the drag race community that follows

28:26.280 --> 28:32.020
the famous RuPaul show of the same name. On the 1st of January 2022, another channel by

28:32.020 --> 28:37.420
the name of TopRPDRVideos uploaded a video accusing Butterface of ripping their content

28:37.420 --> 28:42.460
without providing any credit, subsequently profiting off the success of this content.

28:42.460 --> 28:47.140
In our case, this channel went as far as using parts of our videos instead of hunting down

28:47.140 --> 28:52.220
the original material itself, like it happened with this channel not so long ago, which

28:52.220 --> 28:55.660
is not only immoral, it's also very much illegal.

28:55.660 --> 28:59.260
Butterface then put out a response to this video, and although apologising for any use

28:59.260 --> 29:03.580
of the original creator's material, denied that they were a content farm of any sorts,

29:03.580 --> 29:07.780
with a fully documented backstory and a variety of inspirations for their channel. However,

29:07.780 --> 29:12.460
this was further taken apart by TopRPDRVideos and the community as a whole, ripping into

29:12.460 --> 29:17.020
the inconsistencies and insincerity of such a post, with further evidence that the channel

29:17.020 --> 29:18.700
was merely a content farm.

29:18.700 --> 29:23.060
Meanwhile, a channel called Gringey popped up in my comment section. He took a break

29:23.060 --> 29:27.780
from YouTube. He says his videos were stolen as well.

29:27.780 --> 29:31.260
And if I was sad before, now I'm starting to get a little bit upset.

29:31.260 --> 29:37.180
Oh, wait a moment, what the hell is this? I'm lucky Wao hasn't noticed. No legal team,

29:37.180 --> 29:42.700
they don't mind me. They don't mind you? Didn't you just say, oh, no, no, no, no, no, sorry.

29:42.700 --> 29:46.760
That was part of the introductory spin on the narrative designed to gain more sympathy

29:46.760 --> 29:51.580
before trying to perform some good old character assassination.

29:51.580 --> 29:54.360
Emotions over facts, people. Emotions over facts.

29:54.360 --> 29:58.260
There was one key detail amongst this all that piqued the interest of onlookers from

29:58.260 --> 30:02.800
T-channels, and that was the accusation of the involvement of Anna Oop.

30:02.800 --> 30:07.960
It seems like Team Anna Oop, being a famous YouTuber with millions of subscribers, thought

30:07.960 --> 30:13.920
it would be nice to help her friend Team Butterface with her own channel, not by, you know, inviting

30:13.920 --> 30:19.480
her on her channel, do collaboration, helping her develop her reputation and the connection

30:19.480 --> 30:23.680
with her viewership, like we have basically seen happening everywhere else on YouTube

30:23.680 --> 30:28.640
since its inception. No, no, no, no. She helped by designing her thumbnail.

30:28.640 --> 30:32.520
Yes, in Butterface posts, they credit a close friend for helping them get their channel

30:32.520 --> 30:37.960
off the ground. They don't say who, but TopRPDRvideo seems pretty certain that this special someone

30:37.960 --> 30:41.920
is Anna Oop. Although there is no solidified evidence to confirm this beyond a shadow of

30:41.920 --> 30:46.160
a doubt, it's certainly planted a seed for people to start digging, and not too long

30:46.160 --> 30:49.520
after, another creator appeared on the scene, Paige Christie.

30:49.520 --> 30:52.480
Paige Christie Today, we are talking about another bustling

30:52.480 --> 30:55.960
content farm called Anna Oop.

30:55.960 --> 31:00.080
Page Christie is a commentator who has covered the topic of content farms before, most notably

31:00.080 --> 31:04.040
the Spill saga that followed a similar storyline. She had already expressed her doubts over

31:04.040 --> 31:08.800
the legitimacy of both Anna Oop and Butterface's channels earlier on in the previous year,

31:08.800 --> 31:12.040
and now seemed to have the evidence to prove that they were both connected.

31:12.040 --> 31:14.880
Paige Christie Butterface's first video, and underneath

31:14.880 --> 31:20.040
their first video, which is every single time Monet X Change came for Tamisha Iman, which

31:20.040 --> 31:26.600
was posted on the 16th of June 2021, there was a comment. A comment left by Anna Oop,

31:26.600 --> 31:30.480
and the comment read as follows. Hi guys, I see some of y'all are commenting

31:30.480 --> 31:36.520
that my friend is copying me. I love the art of drag, and so does my friend, and when they

31:36.520 --> 31:40.960
said they were interested in making a channel, I wanted to help out where I could, so I helped

31:40.960 --> 31:45.800
them with the thumbnail design, gave them some editing tips. Please, no hate to them.

31:45.800 --> 31:53.140
P.S. I love butter, this video goes off. Butterface responded with, thank you queen, I probably

31:53.140 --> 31:57.460
should have mentioned somewhere that you gave me some tips. I completely understand everyone's

31:57.460 --> 32:02.520
concerns in the comments. Love you too. And this comment, can I just say, has since

32:02.520 --> 32:10.200
been deleted. The admission that the thumbnails were created at that point by Anna Oop was

32:10.200 --> 32:14.320
all I needed to then go and do some dirty investigation.

32:14.320 --> 32:19.000
This is pretty damning information, particularly when combined with the collective research prior.

32:19.000 --> 32:23.240
It proved that there was an undeniable connection between Butterface and Anna Oop, and if Butterface

32:23.240 --> 32:27.000
was indeed as corporate as they appear to be, then unless they fooled Anna too, there

32:27.000 --> 32:31.360
was no real alternative explanation for how such a scenario could have transpired. If

32:31.360 --> 32:35.560
Anna truly was a friend, then unfortunately that friend was a business. I assume this

32:35.560 --> 32:39.200
was a shock to some, but I think most who followed the situation were just waiting for

32:39.200 --> 32:44.080
their suspicions to be confirmed. The truth was that we were seeing one person supposedly

32:44.080 --> 32:49.360
pumping out up to an hour of highly produced yet fundamentally hollow content every week.

32:49.360 --> 32:52.600
It simultaneously was too bad, and too good to be true.

32:52.600 --> 32:57.840
Butterface is not returned, and I think it's because they know that they don't goof, because

32:57.840 --> 33:02.560
the comments underneath a lot of people are beginning to realize that this is a conglomerate,

33:02.560 --> 33:06.840
and especially when it comes down to straight up stealing other people's content, this is

33:06.840 --> 33:09.260
now majorly overstepping a line.

33:09.260 --> 33:12.840
The evidence had been stacking up for a while, but with all of it accumulating in one place,

33:12.840 --> 33:17.140
it enabled people to understand the depth of this masquerade. Behind it, a very telling

33:17.140 --> 33:21.560
story about Anna Oop, that this person who would use their status as a self-proclaimed

33:21.560 --> 33:25.880
human being to tell stories, plead their case with YouTube on multiple occasions, and even

33:25.880 --> 33:30.500
talk about personal challenges going on in their life was simply not a person at all,

33:30.500 --> 33:35.320
and there was no way that anyone involved had merely accidentally acted like an individual.

33:35.320 --> 33:39.820
This was a fully committed facade, filled to the brim with first-person pronouns. They

33:39.820 --> 33:43.240
knew what they were doing, and they were making a killing from it.

33:43.240 --> 33:46.480
But who were they? Well, there was still a little more to uncover.

33:46.480 --> 33:58.660
One channel that kept coming up when I would do a thumbnail search for thumbnails that

33:58.660 --> 34:05.540
look similar to it was a channel called Rumored. Then I went into Rumored's featured channels,

34:05.540 --> 34:09.800
and I came across another channel called This Happened. As you can see, they all have the

34:09.800 --> 34:15.000
same thumbnail style. And then from This Happened, I went and checked out their featured channels

34:15.000 --> 34:20.960
tab, and would you look at it, there are some people there that we should recognise.

34:20.960 --> 34:24.880
One person called Anna Uncovered, in Paige's video, she showed that there appeared to be

34:24.880 --> 34:28.760
a nexus of channels connected to each other. Some of these were channels that did masquerade

34:28.760 --> 34:32.600
as individual creators, whereas others were presented under the more corporate pretense.

34:32.600 --> 34:36.700
However, on researching one of the channel's URLs, Paige found something else.

34:36.700 --> 34:40.560
Is that all of the rest of the channels did not have a customised HTML, so their YouTube

34:40.560 --> 34:46.640
HTML is youtube.com forward slash c forward slash Daniel O Games. Daniel with the O being

34:46.640 --> 34:53.280
massive games, uppercase S, lowercase s. So one of the jobs it shows is female voice artists

34:53.280 --> 34:58.260
for big celeb channels, as well as the second one that was posted 29th of November, which

34:58.260 --> 35:03.280
is an American female voice artist for a celeb channel. So the advert reads as follows, they

35:03.280 --> 35:08.960
need 10 freelancers. Hello, we are a company called Video Creation Hub. We own several

35:08.960 --> 35:13.800
YouTube channels, and one of them is in the celebrity niche. To give you an example of

35:13.800 --> 35:18.360
the style of work that we're after, check out these channels, and one of them is the

35:18.360 --> 35:22.700
channel This Happened, and the other channel is Pop Juice. This layered down a further

35:22.700 --> 35:27.460
rabbit hole which revealed two companies, Creolone and Video Creation Hub, both of whom

35:27.460 --> 35:34.240
specialised in one thing, YouTube automation. So O works for Video Creation Hub, which are

35:34.240 --> 35:40.280
the people who created this Upwork advert. And on LinkedIn, they state that they are

35:40.280 --> 35:44.720
a content writer, a freelance writer, and a contributing writer. But not only do they

35:44.720 --> 35:50.000
work for the Video Creation Hub, they also work for another company called Creolone Media.

35:50.000 --> 35:55.160
So the Video Creation Hub essentially is a company that considers YouTube profiles as

35:55.160 --> 36:00.320
real estate. They do something that they call YouTube automation. In essence, these companies

36:00.320 --> 36:04.240
are specially designed to build and consolidate large channels and their fanbases. They now

36:04.240 --> 36:10.200
have to communicate with the Gen Z mind. They don't really list their techniques on

36:10.200 --> 36:14.040
the page, trade secrets I suppose, but then again, I feel at this point it's somewhat

36:14.040 --> 36:19.020
evident. So this began to paint another very different picture. There may actually be individuals

36:19.020 --> 36:22.880
behind the channels themselves, but the production comes from a third-party company who turns

36:22.880 --> 36:27.200
that concept into a content farm. Page then provides further evidence to support this,

36:27.200 --> 36:29.600
and it begins to look a bit dystopian, honestly.

36:29.600 --> 36:34.880
An editor from Blank. Passionate about music, entertainment, writing, Dee has put her love

36:34.880 --> 36:41.200
for them together, and specialises in music and entertainment journalism. Currently, Dee

36:41.200 --> 36:46.080
is a scriptwriter at Creolone Media Group, where she writes several scripts a week for

36:46.080 --> 36:48.960
the Butterface YouTube channel.

36:48.960 --> 36:53.480
Creolone Media appears to be aiming for a plethora of genres in the coming months, advertising

36:53.480 --> 36:58.640
roles in channels relating to soccer, text phase horror, rap music. They are essentially

36:58.640 --> 37:02.400
shooting for world domination, or the next best thing. This was daunting.

37:02.400 --> 37:09.680
These people essentially create entire automated channels with voiceover artists, with writers,

37:09.680 --> 37:18.480
with researchers, with editors, with thumbnail creators, with graphic designers, with producers,

37:18.480 --> 37:23.320
with literally just everything it is that you could possibly need to have a channel

37:23.320 --> 37:24.320
and make it run.

37:24.320 --> 37:28.080
Though there was very little to add at the end of Page's video, she channels the frustration

37:28.080 --> 37:31.720
of an individual creator who sees many of her peers struggling to keep up with the sort

37:31.720 --> 37:36.200
of farm that companies like Creolone and Video Creation Hub are operating. Not necessarily

37:36.200 --> 37:39.960
being bothered by their existence, but more about the lie that they wanted to present

37:39.960 --> 37:43.800
themselves as one of us. Page also made a follow up video where she briefly spoke to

37:43.800 --> 37:47.080
truth for reality, and gave his side of the story more attention as well.

37:47.080 --> 37:51.480
Yeah, I reached out to her on two occasions. I wasn't going to strike the videos, I just

37:51.480 --> 37:55.720
wanted her to credit my work. No response. So then they tried to threaten me through

37:55.720 --> 38:00.400
emails with a lawyer. The whole thing is a joke. It really wasn't that serious to me.

38:00.400 --> 38:06.080
So then I asked him if he had a copy of the email that was sent by Anna Solves, and he

38:06.080 --> 38:10.480
basically said to me, he said that he doesn't have it, and that the account that they emailed

38:10.480 --> 38:16.160
from tried to email him a PDF file. He says that those are often used for malicious attacks,

38:16.160 --> 38:20.840
so he blocked the account and erased the entire thread. So take that information whichever

38:20.840 --> 38:25.960
way you want to. I'm more inclined to believe this young man, only because it's not just

38:25.960 --> 38:31.400
him who's saying it. There are several people echoing the same sentiment, and several people

38:31.400 --> 38:37.120
who came over to my video unprovoked to tell me the exact same thing, that Anna Solves

38:37.120 --> 38:39.880
steals content from other content creators.

38:39.880 --> 38:43.920
This was arguably the most serious claim relating to the drama, and certainly asked more of

38:43.920 --> 38:47.680
the companies behind the channels. It also placed the ball firmly in the court of Anna

38:47.680 --> 38:51.400
Oop Butterface and the rest of the channel syndicates. However, their response was more

38:51.400 --> 38:55.720
to erase evidence. As noted in Paige's video, the comment from Anna was quickly deleted

38:55.720 --> 38:59.240
after it was discovered. The video that comment appeared on was subsequently set to private

38:59.240 --> 39:03.120
as well, and a large majority of leads that Paige followed in her video were removed or

39:03.120 --> 39:07.200
hidden. Although Anna would later use the phrase, are videos on Twitter, this seems

39:07.200 --> 39:11.880
to be the closest that there is to an acknowledgement that this is more than one person. However,

39:11.880 --> 39:16.400
in a way, sometimes a lack of response can be considered a response in itself. Outside

39:16.400 --> 39:20.520
of the occasional tweet, Anna Oop's social media accounts largely fell silent. They stopped

39:20.520 --> 39:24.080
posting on their community tab altogether on each of their channels, and just returned

39:24.080 --> 39:29.880
to the regular upload schedule. Anna Oop still has a personality, unfortunately, but outside

39:29.880 --> 39:33.960
of the content, there is no real attempt to build a fanbase. AnnaPlays, the channel that

39:33.960 --> 39:37.660
was designed to cultivate a closer relationship between the channel and the audience, uploaded

39:37.660 --> 39:42.480
their last video in May 2022, and has been dormant since. Interestingly, not nearly a

39:42.480 --> 39:47.180
month after, another channel returned to the platform, Butterface, with a video about drag

39:47.180 --> 39:51.540
queen drama. What a surprise. Their video on the topic of a queen pretending to be a

39:51.540 --> 39:56.300
ready to defend themselves was at least somewhat ironic, but the description was what was even

39:56.300 --> 40:00.620
more interesting. Here they drop the guise of being an individual person, and admit that

40:00.620 --> 40:05.220
they are operated by a company, and realise the ethical qualms of behaving in such a way.

40:05.220 --> 40:08.840
They want to do better, and have since adapted to a more corporate format to distinguish

40:08.840 --> 40:12.980
themselves from other individual creators. This wouldn't have been a bad response if

40:12.980 --> 40:17.540
this had been their first response. Unfortunately, they already had one shot at explaining themselves,

40:17.540 --> 40:21.220
and many people considered this apology to be a result of their failure to maintain the

40:21.220 --> 40:25.480
masquerade. I think the apology also rang hollow in the greater sense as well, because

40:25.480 --> 40:28.980
other channels that were seemingly friends with Butterface, and were ruined to be a part

40:28.980 --> 40:33.340
of this syndicate, most notably Anna Oop, were still using personal branding to do just

40:33.340 --> 40:37.960
what Butterface admitted to be unethical. But sometimes, friends have different opinions

40:37.960 --> 40:38.960
I suppose.

40:38.960 --> 40:41.100
Anna Oop I'm sorry, but why does every Kardashian

40:41.100 --> 40:46.020
or Jenner out there try to ruin their memes by profiting off them, and reusing them over

40:46.020 --> 40:47.020
and over again?

40:47.020 --> 40:49.260
TRO Nonetheless, the apology did serve as strong

40:49.260 --> 40:52.820
confirmation for the broader theory surrounding these channels, and ultimately proved that

40:52.820 --> 40:57.100
no matter what was hidden, the explanation remained the same. Anna Oop was not who they

40:57.100 --> 41:01.100
said they were, and they were just one of the many channels that began to infiltrate

41:01.100 --> 41:05.620
and create a sphere. Who knows what these channels are, or if we can even identify them,

41:05.620 --> 41:09.660
but regardless, if Butterface or Anna Oop's presence meant anything, it meant that they

41:09.660 --> 41:10.660
were already here.

41:10.660 --> 41:13.940
It's a pretty simple observation to make, but I think what bothered people the most

41:13.940 --> 41:17.820
was just the lie in the first place. It's not like this was the only way for corporate

41:17.820 --> 41:21.860
channels to survive in the 21st century, there is more than enough proof you can thrive in

41:21.860 --> 41:25.220
your own space regardless of who owns you, and there are more than enough successful

41:25.220 --> 41:29.140
channels to demonstrate that. They just wanted a piece of the pie, and it makes sense in

41:29.140 --> 41:30.140
a way.

41:30.140 --> 41:33.700
Personally fronted YouTube channels have far better audience retention, compare a channel

41:33.700 --> 41:40.420
like Anna Oop with Pop Juice. Pop Juice presently has 129 million views with 220,000 subscribers,

41:40.420 --> 41:45.660
Anna Oop had 440,000 subscribers with half the amount of cumulative views. The whole

41:45.660 --> 41:49.480
reason retention is higher is because viewers think you're a real person, which might

41:49.480 --> 41:53.140
be considered a bit of a deal breaker when you're not.

41:53.140 --> 42:02.340
So who is the real Anna Oop?

42:02.340 --> 42:06.220
As we kinda found out already, there's certainly a degree of deception involved in the curation

42:06.220 --> 42:09.940
of these channels, but when establishing the timeline for this situation, you'll realise

42:09.940 --> 42:13.440
there are more smoke and mirrors that had not been accounted for. Let's start from

42:13.440 --> 42:17.820
the top with one simple factoid that we know to be true, Anna Oop's channel was launched

42:17.820 --> 42:22.260
on the 12th of May 2019. That makes sense in this timeline given the channel's subsequent

42:22.260 --> 42:26.740
success in the following years. However, we also know that around the start of 2020,

42:26.740 --> 42:30.740
Anna Oop conducted an overhaul on their channel, their social media accounts, and a large number

42:30.740 --> 42:35.500
of videos were subsequently deleted. I can't give you the exact reason why without speculation,

42:35.500 --> 42:39.180
but I did say I would return to this point, and that's because there is something interesting

42:39.180 --> 42:43.140
about their original Twitter that has been preserved, and that is the use of plural pronouns

42:43.140 --> 42:47.360
to describe their channel. At first when I found it, I assumed that it could be a typo,

42:47.360 --> 42:51.180
but it kept appearing, and appearing, and appearing, to a point where I assumed that

42:51.180 --> 42:55.440
it must have been intentional. Anna Oop started out as a corporate channel that knew to an

42:55.440 --> 42:59.540
extent it was just that. Although there seemed to be an individual person assigned to their

42:59.540 --> 43:04.460
social media, the channel was quite transparent about it being more than one person. However,

43:04.460 --> 43:08.620
by May 2020, this had completely changed, and even their YouTube description read that

43:08.620 --> 43:12.660
they were a 21 year old girl from America, which I always found such a strange detail

43:12.660 --> 43:16.260
to include in their channel because I don't think that many people could care enough about

43:16.260 --> 43:20.780
their about page to update it with every passing birthday. I switched to voiceovers that start

43:20.780 --> 43:25.180
the new year also changed the game with respect to how Anna operated. They moved towards this

43:25.180 --> 43:28.740
more personal bond with their audience, and began to integrate things like birthdays,

43:28.740 --> 43:32.940
Q&As, things that would draw people in. It was the next step of the business model. This

43:32.940 --> 43:37.020
one didn't raise too many abject suspicions at the time because it seemed like a natural

43:37.020 --> 43:40.700
progression, revealing something personal about yourself, it all seemed fair and square.

43:40.700 --> 43:44.780
However, with the next step, the expansion, some more evidence of suspicious behaviour

43:44.780 --> 43:45.780
emerges.

43:45.780 --> 43:51.060
So their YouTube HTML is youtube.com forward slash c forward slash Daniel O Games. Daniel

43:51.060 --> 43:55.780
with the O being massive, games, uppercase S, lowercase s.

43:55.780 --> 44:00.540
When watching Betty Page's video, I was surprised when she mentioned Popjuice's URL, that being

44:00.540 --> 44:05.800
of Danielo Games. I struggle to rethink what Danielo and his games had to do with a social

44:05.800 --> 44:10.020
media channel covering trending topics, but more interestingly, I'd noticed this when

44:10.020 --> 44:15.280
researching the Anna franchise earlier on in the day. What do I mean by this? The interesting

44:15.280 --> 44:19.760
detail about Anna's secondary projects is that Anna Solve's, Anna Uncovered, and

44:19.760 --> 44:24.380
Anna Horror Story's channels were seemingly founded before Anna Oop's own channel was.

44:24.380 --> 44:28.800
This wasn't something dubious beyond doubt, plenty of people of old channels may revamp

44:28.800 --> 44:33.180
for content production, but it certainly made one curious, and then you go to the archives

44:33.180 --> 44:37.280
of these channels, and on each of these accounts you will find an old screenshot of the channel

44:37.280 --> 44:41.680
belonging to someone who seemingly has no relation to Anna Oop whatsoever. These channels

44:41.680 --> 44:46.220
typically display around a five-figure subscriber count, and seemingly all relate to Hispanic

44:46.220 --> 44:50.120
content creators, which are also found to be a very strange connection, so it appears

44:50.120 --> 44:54.360
the people behind the Anna Oop channel purchased these channels as they believed it would maximise

44:54.360 --> 44:58.640
their chances for subscriber growth, which also explains why Anna was so close to reaching

44:58.640 --> 45:03.320
100,000 subscribers so soon after their first video on the Anna Solve channel.

45:03.320 --> 45:07.400
However, when returning to this theory today, I hit a roadblock, because the Anna Horror

45:07.400 --> 45:12.040
Story's channel that I pulled up said it was created in June 2021, which would have

45:12.040 --> 45:15.980
been around the time the channel went live. I took a moment to wonder whether I'd just

45:15.980 --> 45:19.800
made a mistake, it wouldn't be the first time, but I thought I'd retrace my steps

45:19.800 --> 45:24.600
to the tweet promoting the channel. I followed the link on the tweets, and then it hit me.

45:24.600 --> 45:30.160
There are two different Anna Horror Story's channels. Has anyone ever noticed this? It

45:30.160 --> 45:34.600
appears the second Anna Horror Story's channel had picked up where the first one left off.

45:34.600 --> 45:38.520
I was mobbing on the first channel in May, and resuming on the second channel in June.

45:38.520 --> 45:42.600
My guess would be monetisation issues as I didn't see any ads on the first channel,

45:42.600 --> 45:47.000
but it's still an utterly bizarre situation. Normally you'd expect Anna to take to Twitter,

45:47.000 --> 45:50.980
but there's just this strange period of radio silence, and no evidence that they ever attempted

45:50.980 --> 45:54.820
to have the lack of monetisation on that channel changed, which is also surprising given they

45:54.820 --> 45:58.720
regularly complain to YouTube when they feel they've been maltreated. Perhaps this time

45:58.720 --> 46:02.280
they kinda knew what they were doing was wrong and didn't want to attract attention to

46:02.280 --> 46:06.640
it, but that's just a guess. Beyond the assumption these channels were bought, I mean I doubt

46:06.640 --> 46:10.680
Anna was also a male Mexican gamer in their spare time, the Anna Horror Story's channel's

46:10.680 --> 46:14.600
URL was advertised in a forum a few weeks before the Anna Horror Story's channel was

46:14.600 --> 46:17.360
launched. The link speaks for itself.

46:17.360 --> 46:21.000
Now on principle I don't really mind people trading accounts, people can cultivate what

46:21.000 --> 46:25.160
they want and pass it on for all I care, however buying accounts often does beat a very dangerous

46:25.160 --> 46:28.940
side of YouTube, the one where people hack accounts to sell them on. I'm sure we all

46:28.940 --> 46:33.800
know creatives had their channel turned into a Tesla fan page recently, it's not fun.

46:33.800 --> 46:37.080
And although I doubt the team behind Anna Oop is hacking these channels themselves,

46:37.080 --> 46:40.040
it definitely speaks to the corporate approach of content farms they wouldn't consider the

46:40.040 --> 46:43.880
trade they're participating in. In the case of the Anna Horror Story's channel, despite

46:43.880 --> 46:47.340
previously being a Spanish speaking channel, it was being advertised by an American or

46:47.340 --> 46:51.680
Canadian user whose approval for monetisation message was written in English. It's not

46:51.680 --> 46:55.900
evidence beyond a doubt because Spanish speaking people do live in America, but it's food

46:55.900 --> 46:59.860
for thought, yet it's not something that Anna's team would ever think or care about

46:59.860 --> 47:01.140
themselves.

47:01.140 --> 47:04.340
As they expanded, they assumed they'd hire more and more people for these channels, and

47:04.340 --> 47:08.620
having less ability to actually critically stay in touch with the content they were creating.

47:08.620 --> 47:12.040
In a way, ironically, this worked somewhat to their advantage, whereas a channel like

47:12.040 --> 47:16.420
Spill's content drew suspicion for being too good for a single person, Anna Oop and

47:16.420 --> 47:20.020
their accompanying channels never had to worry about that, they occupied this position where

47:20.020 --> 47:24.140
they could pull off the act of being human through what appeared to be human error. So

47:24.140 --> 47:27.700
just because something's human doesn't mean it's good. In the meantime, their social

47:27.700 --> 47:31.820
media started drawing with a variety of creators, especially easy targets that would embolden

47:31.820 --> 47:35.740
their status in the community, calling out others and using a face reveal bait to launch

47:35.740 --> 47:40.460
a distract on their detractors. It all pointed to one thing, Anna Oop et al weren't just

47:40.460 --> 47:44.380
a content farm, they were a bad content farm, and the only way they were able to keep their

47:44.380 --> 47:48.960
feet on the ground in this genre was pretending to be a singular person, and simply outmaneuvering

47:48.960 --> 47:53.140
all the actual people by rigging an algorithm in their favour by buying channels and strafe

47:53.140 --> 47:58.060
running content, while holding hollow opinions that align with yours to keep them watching.

47:58.060 --> 48:03.060
And the worst thing about it, is that it completely, 100% worked.

48:12.660 --> 48:16.820
There's one more point I want to make regarding Butterface's apology, and that's a video

48:16.820 --> 48:18.380
that was published alongside it.

48:18.380 --> 48:23.540
Fans wanted to get to the bottom of things themselves, and even one fan tweeted Trinity

48:23.540 --> 48:27.580
and asked her point blank if the account was hers, to which she responded,

48:27.580 --> 48:29.780
Oh yes, I'm still on Reddit.

48:29.780 --> 48:36.140
You might be thinking, ooh girl, that sounds like a confession. Well, it is, but it also

48:36.140 --> 48:37.740
isn't, if that makes sense.

48:37.740 --> 48:41.020
It's not exactly an objectionable video, but it's so strange seeing a channel that

48:41.020 --> 48:45.420
is a self-admitted corporation trying to use jargon with intonations that it doesn't

48:45.420 --> 48:48.780
feel like they can ever truly understand. Sure, they've dropped the guise that they're

48:48.780 --> 48:52.540
a real person, they've said they understand why it's ethically questionable to do so,

48:52.540 --> 48:55.580
but they're still trying to pull off that attitude that garnered them the attention

48:55.580 --> 48:58.640
in the first place. With the knowledge that there are people behind the scenes pulling

48:58.640 --> 49:02.780
the strings to make this video appealing to you, it just feels rather weird.

49:02.780 --> 49:06.420
Audiences like to feel they're in control of the content they consume, and that's

49:06.420 --> 49:09.420
why the difference between a rather generic corporate channel, and one that's trying

49:09.420 --> 49:13.580
to yassify their view count comes into play. A middle ground corporate channel just wants

49:13.580 --> 49:17.760
the view, the click, it's a transactional thing that both parties are aware of. These

49:17.760 --> 49:21.820
channels though, they do something different, they commercialise the viewer's connection

49:21.820 --> 49:25.400
with the community and the culture that comes with it, so they appropriate parts of it to

49:25.400 --> 49:29.380
appeal to people. To be honest, it's not that I think it's inherently immoral to

49:29.380 --> 49:33.400
do that, but I think it does make people uncomfortable, and I don't think people are often willing

49:33.400 --> 49:37.460
to support a channel like that, which is probably why the guise of an individual person is always

49:37.460 --> 49:42.320
going to be more effective, even if you gave a corporation personality. Unfortunately,

49:42.320 --> 49:45.680
it's just not believable that there are a bunch of guys in suits who are genuinely

49:45.680 --> 49:50.240
shook over whatever's being said between online influencers. Companies just don't

49:50.240 --> 49:54.840
have the merit to appear legitimately interested in certain circles of culture, but it can't

49:54.840 --> 49:56.320
stop them from trying.

49:56.320 --> 50:00.740
As a corporate channel, Anna Oop had very few defining features, no exceptional research,

50:00.740 --> 50:05.240
no great wisdom to impart, but as a person, their personality perfectly fit into a community

50:05.240 --> 50:09.920
that welcomed the characteristically audacious creator who just says what she feels and doesn't

50:09.920 --> 50:12.680
have a damn who tries to stop her tea-spilling endeavours.

50:12.680 --> 50:17.200
Anna Oop We all sat through hours and hours of cringe

50:17.200 --> 50:23.320
music this year, and I think we all understood that influencers should not make music. Unless

50:23.320 --> 50:26.160
you're the hypocritical b**** that is me, of course.

50:26.160 --> 50:28.260
TRO Say what you want about Spill, I think many

50:28.260 --> 50:31.840
gave them their fair share of criticism back in the day, but they weren't necessarily

50:31.840 --> 50:35.880
bad at what they were doing. The least I can say about them is that in the general discourse

50:35.880 --> 50:39.640
of corporate-based channels, they did a decent job at keeping their audience informed and

50:39.680 --> 50:43.360
maintained. They presented content in a way that many channels simply could not, and those

50:43.360 --> 50:47.800
are two of the key tenets of any YouTube channel that I mentioned in the introduction.

50:47.800 --> 50:52.060
Anna Oop, on the other hand, was just mass-produced junk food content. I think that's what bothers

50:52.060 --> 50:56.200
me the most about their channel as a concept. Corporations do have the ability to do what

50:56.200 --> 51:00.000
many individual creators cannot, and they can achieve great feats with their resources

51:00.000 --> 51:04.080
and manpower. Have the team behind Anna Oop settled on purposely being less than that

51:04.080 --> 51:08.160
because they wanted the illusion of humanity? All these opinions about who was in the right

51:08.160 --> 51:13.120
or wrong in their content, possibly fabricated to play to a crowd. It's risky business

51:13.120 --> 51:17.920
doing that, and easily leads to contradictions that could harm people involved or mentioned.

51:17.920 --> 51:22.480
The truth is that everything is an algorithm to some extent, even personal values and expressions

51:22.480 --> 51:27.000
of those that can supposedly organically draw an audience in. It's an inevitability, and

51:27.000 --> 51:30.240
plenty of creators have been called out in their time for expressing opinions they may

51:30.240 --> 51:34.320
not truly hold. Playing to the crowd is common. However, when you engineer channels with the

51:34.320 --> 51:37.640
sole intent to play into the crowd, not only do you reduce the realm of critical thought

51:37.680 --> 51:42.000
in that genre, you also may make a lot of damn additional mistakes. The majority opinion

51:42.000 --> 51:46.200
isn't always the right one. Making errors is part of life as an individual creator,

51:46.200 --> 51:50.240
we're only human and we strive to grow. At the same time, I think most creators' lives

51:50.240 --> 51:53.360
would be easier if we didn't make those errors and didn't have to deal with the

51:53.360 --> 51:56.920
guilt and shame that comes with them. To have a corporate network, the creative formula

51:56.920 --> 52:00.800
to enable those errors is just insulting to the people who spend hours trying to avoid

52:00.800 --> 52:05.700
such pitfalls. It also amplifies harm that can be spread through falsehoods and misrepresentations

52:05.700 --> 52:09.780
that may not have spread otherwise. This was especially valid with the true crime genre,

52:09.780 --> 52:14.600
a section of YouTube that demands meticulousness and dignity for all those involved. The incompetence

52:14.600 --> 52:18.700
of Anna Sols could not have just prospectively damaged other creators in the domain, but

52:18.700 --> 52:23.140
also victims and their families as well who are often the subject of these stories. That's

52:23.140 --> 52:26.820
why a personal connection to the content is often important, because that connection will

52:26.820 --> 52:30.420
provide you with an inherent motive to be sensitive to the world around you, otherwise

52:30.420 --> 52:34.300
the only real motive that exists is the one the numbers, and sometimes the numbers will

52:34.300 --> 52:37.940
tell you to do something different to the people. Sure, the best way to attract clicks

52:37.940 --> 52:42.180
is to exaggerate titles and thumbnails, while dramatising the story and asking viewers what

52:42.180 --> 52:46.380
do you think about this mass murderer, but not all content should be treated that way.

52:46.380 --> 52:50.100
When Anna Oop moved from the T to true crime, there wasn't any real acknowledgement of

52:50.100 --> 52:54.260
the sheer differences between the two realms. Too many businesses don't distinguish that

52:54.260 --> 52:58.160
one genre may have different rules to another, because they lack that personal connection

52:58.160 --> 53:03.140
to understand the nuances, which is what caused so much unrest in the true crime community.

53:03.140 --> 53:07.660
People felt that Anna didn't respect those cases, and they may well have been correct.

53:07.660 --> 53:11.300
The other problem with seeing matters only through numbers is how you interpret the absence

53:11.300 --> 53:15.300
of others, and how you interact with criticism. The Truth Through Reality situation showed

53:15.300 --> 53:19.280
us that, separate to the point of copyright altogether, the Anna Solves community post

53:19.280 --> 53:23.000
projected the intention of a channel like theirs onto a channel like Truth's, who

53:23.000 --> 53:26.860
for all intents and purposes doesn't actually sincerely care about the stories he covers.

53:26.860 --> 53:30.500
It's particularly illuminating the comparison of the response to someone like Truth, a smaller

53:30.500 --> 53:35.000
creator, and Mr Balan, a larger creator. One video is taken down swiftly and silently,

53:35.000 --> 53:39.120
the other resulted in a public campaign that only stalled when people called them out for

53:39.120 --> 53:42.500
it. And alright, maybe they would have been able to pass as a person with less outrage

53:42.500 --> 53:46.760
if they'd merely created content and avoided any outside interactions, but they used this

53:46.760 --> 53:51.120
perception as a human to instigate drama with other creators and elicit sympathy from their

53:51.120 --> 53:55.300
viewers. It gave them the ability to use those human emotions to leverage favourable outcomes

53:55.300 --> 53:59.100
and just attention in general. How that sort of attention could only yield so much good

53:59.100 --> 54:03.100
when your own shortcomings become more noticeable, and the channels around you begin to falter

54:03.100 --> 54:07.460
as well. Even businesses stretch themselves thin trying to cut corners, and the same numbers

54:07.460 --> 54:10.780
that tell you the more content the better make you forget about the other numbers that

54:10.780 --> 54:14.820
gave you those numbers in the first place. In the end, even without an admission, people

54:14.820 --> 54:33.420
felt the mask had slipped, an inhuman schedule with an inhumane approach. All was undone.

54:33.420 --> 54:36.980
Nothing was real.

54:36.980 --> 54:46.500
I suppose behind the scenes there are many ways that the AnnoOops squad could have responded

54:46.500 --> 54:50.380
with which we would not necessarily be aware of. They could have found a person with a

54:50.380 --> 54:53.660
bit more experience in the community, and given them greater reins over the research

54:53.660 --> 54:57.500
and production. They could have centralised the channel's presence more on an individual,

54:57.500 --> 55:01.100
given them control of operations, or at least helped them oversee the work being done on

55:01.100 --> 55:04.900
their behalf. They're never gonna be as organic as some, but for all we know these

55:04.900 --> 55:08.580
are steps that could have been taken since being called out, which is why I don't want

55:08.580 --> 55:12.740
to presently malign them too much when not entitled to know exactly everything someone

55:12.740 --> 55:17.540
is doing to improve themselves. However, it's hard to say that outside of that, any individual

55:17.540 --> 55:20.980
passion has been developed for the content they're creating, although avoiding any

55:20.980 --> 55:24.700
large scale controversies have still occasionally been called out and criticised for a lack

55:24.700 --> 55:28.700
of originality in their content. A recent video, in particular from a YouTuber by the

55:28.700 --> 55:32.800
name of The Asher Show, alleges that they have copied his topics multiple times, without

55:32.800 --> 55:34.640
providing any credits.

56:02.800 --> 56:12.600
Two months ago, November 5th, I made this video the history of the most hated person

56:12.600 --> 56:20.060
on TikTok. It did quite well, 889,000 views, but here three weeks ago, January 6th, the

56:20.060 --> 56:24.860
childish TikToker who got cancelled for being annoying. It's getting a little too coincidental

56:24.860 --> 56:30.620
at this point. November 26th, 2022, I posted this. Anna Oop posted this January 9th, 2023.

56:30.620 --> 56:34.480
And the weirdest part about this, nothing in the description, no references here, but

56:34.480 --> 56:38.700
everyone just take a listen, and who is speaking at the beginning of this video?

56:38.700 --> 56:44.420
Baguette! Baguette sauce! Meatballs!

56:44.420 --> 56:47.460
Hate people that waste food, why do you have to waste food on TikTok?

56:47.460 --> 56:51.700
No thanks! Come on! Just a little bit.

56:51.700 --> 56:56.140
It's like, the more food you waste, the more views it gets. Why?

56:56.140 --> 56:57.140
Idiot!

56:57.140 --> 57:02.660
It's not funny, you're just being completely wasteful. Am I on the Anna Oop payroll now?

57:02.660 --> 57:04.340
Now I'm voicing your channel?

57:04.340 --> 57:08.180
There are a few examples here that I think fall into a grey area, and I'm not sure

57:08.180 --> 57:12.420
they point to the degree of plagiarism previously covered, but together they definitely do paint

57:12.420 --> 57:16.660
a picture. I don't think this is exactly content theft, but it does kind of represent

57:16.660 --> 57:20.900
what Anna Oop is without the pretense that they're a real person, just a hollow machine

57:20.900 --> 57:25.300
that can't produce original thoughts or ideas for themselves. Another notable example

57:25.300 --> 57:28.580
of this was Anna Oop's video on Technoblade shortly after his death.

57:28.580 --> 57:33.780
Hello everyone, Technoblade here. If you're watching this, I'm dead.

57:33.780 --> 57:37.340
Given that Anna hadn't really shown much investment in the Minecraft community, this

57:37.340 --> 57:40.980
video just seemed really out of place for the channel, and the video itself just felt

57:40.980 --> 57:44.940
like they were regurgitating information they read elsewhere, and adding a delicate piano

57:44.940 --> 57:48.820
to provide it with an illusion of poignancy, with a lot of people calling it out in the

57:48.820 --> 57:49.820
comments.

57:49.820 --> 57:54.140
Alex had rarely shown himself on his YouTube videos, as he made it clear to his fans that

57:54.140 --> 57:59.940
he prefers to present himself as an avatar instead, and guys, his own fans even recognised

57:59.940 --> 58:03.060
Technoblade as his real name throughout the years on YouTube.

58:03.060 --> 58:06.900
However, even with content that you'd expect Anna to be a bit more familiar with, you see

58:06.900 --> 58:10.900
a lot of comments deriding Anna Oop for their rather obnoxious clickbait, luring people

58:10.900 --> 58:14.620
in with borderline false statements. I'd probably have more to say if the topics didn't

58:14.620 --> 58:18.540
bore me so much, but it is absolutely amazing what some people can turn into an 8 minute

58:18.540 --> 58:22.460
video today, but then again it's amazing what some people can turn into a 4 hour video

58:22.460 --> 58:23.460
too.

58:23.460 --> 58:30.540
Do y'all love the sound of peace and quiet? Do you wake up in the morning feeling content?

58:30.540 --> 58:35.900
No? Yeah. Me neither. Y'all.

58:35.900 --> 58:39.700
To me it doesn't feel like anything's changed at all, and it's hard to change sometimes

58:39.700 --> 58:43.020
when you have a formula that's working, and outside of a certain sect of people in

58:43.020 --> 58:47.260
the T community, the greater YouTube audience don't tend to watch such content, and majority

58:47.260 --> 58:50.620
people don't care for the drama, they don't read the comments, they don't watch the

58:50.620 --> 58:54.140
videos, they simply don't care, and who can blame them, there are only so many hours

58:54.140 --> 58:57.940
in the day to spend indulging in drama content, and those viewers are probably more interested

58:57.940 --> 59:01.980
in Selena Gomez than they are the person talking about them. The only person to blame really

59:01.980 --> 59:06.140
is Anna, and well they're not really a person, they're part of a company doing what they

59:06.140 --> 59:10.060
know best, they say and they do what is best for themselves, they don't relate to that

59:10.060 --> 59:13.740
moral obligation that other creators may do, because from their point of view, what does

59:13.740 --> 59:17.060
it matter whether they are who they say they are if they can deliver content that people

59:17.060 --> 59:20.860
want to watch? Being an influencer on any platform is profitable, they're celebrities

59:20.860 --> 59:24.180
of their own kind who don't have to provide every single detail of their existence if

59:24.180 --> 59:27.820
they don't want to, they don't have to show their face, they don't even have to talk,

59:27.820 --> 59:31.580
it's the perfect combination for someone looking to make a few bucks, you can create

59:31.580 --> 59:35.460
celebrities without proving they're even real. The problem is that when you do that,

59:35.460 --> 59:39.180
you force out individuals who actually are who they say they are. That's why Anna Oop

59:39.180 --> 59:43.020
really was the worst kind of business venture, in their head what they were doing was merely

59:43.020 --> 59:46.860
trying to fit in, succeeding in an area where there wasn't massive competition by corporate

59:46.860 --> 59:50.700
channels, but really what they did was take over a market whose sole existence was based

59:50.700 --> 59:54.380
on individuality, and directly competing with creators who could never dream of keeping

59:54.380 --> 59:58.500
up with such a production line. It's like asking IBM to create a computer for your amateur

59:58.500 --> 01:00:02.980
chess tournament, sure the computer is gonna win, but what was the point anyway? They have

01:00:02.980 --> 01:00:06.540
their own realms where they can compete, domains where they can succeed and flourish, and generally

01:00:06.540 --> 01:00:10.000
facilitate the creation of technology that a single person may struggle with. Although

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:14.920
owning all the casual chess players is something they can do, is it something they should do?

01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:18.840
Beyond the conceptual problem of having companies in control of public opinion, it's bad for

01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:22.720
other creators as well, we constantly have the discussion on YouTube regarding creator

01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:26.780
burnout, the fragility of mental health, but a creator's first priority will nearly always

01:00:26.780 --> 01:00:30.680
be to keep their channel alive, and if they're competing with people who have infinitely

01:00:30.680 --> 01:00:34.880
more resources to do that then they will struggle, their channel will either fall to the wayside

01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:38.520
because they know they can't keep up, or the creator will run out of fuel trying to

01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:42.320
do so. There's no winning option for the individual here other than to attempt to be

01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:46.000
a better content farm, and we've already seen the distinct problems with that which

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:50.120
can really harm a community. If content is watered down to meet people's expectations

01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:53.720
then the quality of discourse suffers too, then the only option left for people craving

01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:58.520
a higher standard of information is for better content farms like Spill. This may well happen,

01:00:58.520 --> 01:01:03.400
and if audiences choose it then so be it, maybe people enjoy content farms, but I'd

01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:07.080
like to advocate for the power of the individual creators, the ones who are gonna talk about

01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:10.660
these subjects because they care about them. Over time plenty more Anna oops are gonna

01:01:10.660 --> 01:01:14.060
pop up, and they're gonna masquerade as people because it's their market that can

01:01:14.060 --> 01:01:18.040
be tapped. The power of social bond that can be formed is priceless for them, but it's

01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:22.200
always a one way relationship for a business like theirs. Many of these channels will completely

01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:26.080
lack a personal connection to their content, and the community that has instilled a social

01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:29.980
status on them, which is why it was so easy for a channel like Anna's to lie about their

01:01:29.980 --> 01:01:34.240
identity in the first place. That's why individuals matter more in these spaces, because

01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:38.320
there's an expectation to care, an expectation to listen. There's nothing right now I could

01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:42.920
say to this company, but there's always something you can say to a person. Anna Oop is the sort

01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:46.000
of channel that I just don't really enjoy, and I honestly wouldn't have too much to

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:50.600
say outside of that if Anna was a real content creator, a biased YouTuber who plays with

01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:54.760
the crowd and is careless with details they should be more diligent with. What's new?

01:01:54.760 --> 01:01:58.600
But the truth is Anna Oop was more than that, they were a channel that built themselves

01:01:58.600 --> 01:02:03.280
on a fundamental lie, utilised all the advantages of a well invested company with pre-purchase

01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:07.220
channels and conveyor belt content, while utilising audience sympathy by complaining

01:02:07.220 --> 01:02:11.080
to others about how oppressed they were as an individual creator. They really had their

01:02:11.080 --> 01:02:15.720
fingers in all the pies. Following these successes, the Anna Oop team had the choice to be better

01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:20.240
as channels as they branched out into more sensitive subjects, and just chose not to

01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:24.320
be, using their increased money to just pump out more content rather than improving what

01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:27.920
they produced as a whole. I think the most sinister fact about the plagiarism case was

01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:32.160
that Anna Oop took advantage of that humanity, that belief in their identity, and warped

01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:37.120
into a way to attack a creator who had no motive to maliciously take their content down.

01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:40.000
Anna Oop has removed countless videos from their channel before, it would have been a

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:44.020
drop in the corporate ocean, and yet they went down swinging. When the whole network

01:02:44.020 --> 01:02:47.900
was called out, they just scaled down the project a little, still passing their content

01:02:47.900 --> 01:02:52.640
off from a first person perspective with tons of tea spilling opinions to this day. It's

01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:57.560
all a crock of shit, a big crock of shit, and part of me expects I should be more bothered,

01:02:57.560 --> 01:03:01.200
but in the end this just feels inevitable, there's only so many arguments I could make

01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:05.540
surrounding their existence, and all I'd finish on is why would we need companies pretending

01:03:05.540 --> 01:03:12.560
to be YouTubers when we already have YouTubers? What does Anna Oop really offer? Businesses

01:03:12.560 --> 01:03:17.900
on YouTube, for better and for worse they're here to stay, and in many cases I try not

01:03:17.900 --> 01:03:22.300
to view their presence as a wholly negative feature, but they can be, especially when

01:03:22.300 --> 01:03:25.920
all they offer is a highly processed form of content that is propped up by communities

01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:30.280
they'll never truly understand. Anna Oop is an example of that, and one can only hope

01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:35.640
their formula isn't one that is duplicated too often. However, if they are here to stay,

01:03:35.640 --> 01:03:41.640
I hope they remember there are some things you can't, and shouldn't, invent. Thank you.

01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:07.280
average of one to two videos per day so it's quite literally physically impossible that

01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:13.320
Anna Oop doesn't have any help with at least to prove to you guys without a shadow of a

01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:19.180
doubt that Anna Oop, one of the biggest T channels, one of the biggest drama content

01:04:19.180 --> 01:04:26.180
creators here on the platform is a part of a massive content farm. Anna Oop!

01:04:30.280 --> 01:04:36.640
Ok guys, that was the video, I hope you all enjoyed it, thank you if you made it this

01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:41.480
far. I'd first like to give a big shout out to the editors, once again their names will

01:04:41.480 --> 01:04:45.480
be on the screen, and in the pinned comment they do a great job, if you wanna check out

01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:49.600
more of their work it'll be down there below to have a look at. I wanna give a big thanks

01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:55.160
to my patrons, $10 patrons on the screen right now, thank you so much for your contribution

01:04:55.160 --> 01:05:03.920
guys, and also my $50 patrons, Laura Woodward, Sari Tish, Esther Bedoya, and Hypercube. Thank

01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:08.000
you so much, these guys have been around for a pretty decent amount of time now so I really

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:12.260
do appreciate it. What else do I need to thank? I feel like I'm missing something. Big thanks

01:05:12.260 --> 01:05:18.760
to Thumbnail by Starpo, big thanks to the artists who do wonderful art, great in the

01:05:18.760 --> 01:05:23.880
video, if your art is featured in this video and you're looking for credit then just let

01:05:23.880 --> 01:05:29.000
me know. Merch, as I said we're still doing merch, I really like the mugs we do, if you

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:35.000
wanna check them out, once again, link will be in the pinned comment, and it's getting

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:40.080
a bit hot up here so I'll probably wrap it up quickly, but hope you enjoyed the video,

01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:43.160
and I'm The Right Opinion, and I'll see you in the next one.

01:05:53.880 --> 01:06:03.880
Thank you so much for watching, and I'll see you in the next one.
