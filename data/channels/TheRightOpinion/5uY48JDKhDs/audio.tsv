0	13860	Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too
13860	17660	much free time, and businesses on YouTube. Whether we like it or not, they're here
17660	22340	to stay, and in many cases, I try not to view their presence as a wholly negative one. It's
22340	26560	important to remember that one of our primary purposes as creators is to bring entertainment
26560	30300	to those who use the platform, and if a channel can do that, whoever it's run by, then we
30300	34580	can broadly agree that it's a net positive for audiences. Businesses will always occupy
34580	39020	a realm of YouTube, and I do believe there can be a peaceful coexistence. At the same
39020	42980	time, there will always be tension. To be honest, it's understandable why more grassroots
42980	47140	creators feel unnerved by their presence. Businesses have so much more power and resources
47140	51240	at their fingertips to outflank independent YouTubers in many aspects of quality control.
51240	54900	They can create high production pieces in a few days that would take an individual upwards
54900	58600	of a month, bombing the algorithm with a myriad of content that often gives what many
58600	63120	would perceive an unfair advantage to them against the humble creator. When market domination
63120	67120	comes from a few large corporations, the outcome for the consumer is generally not particularly
67120	70920	positive. It leads to less diversity in general, and more control of narratives by a select
70920	74560	few people, and in industries that are already prone enough to corruption, it's anything
74560	78380	but healthy. YouTube was built on the notion of allowing a person to broadcast themselves
78380	81840	without the necessary investment of a larger business so they didn't have to dance to
81840	85260	anyone's tunes, and many people would like to keep it that way. Fortunately, there will
85260	89060	always be people who will occupy these spaces regardless of their market success, but at
89060	93220	the same time, it's still good to have individual figures in influential positions who can represent
93220	97100	a human aspect to content creation, and although businesses have certainly made more inroads
97100	100140	on the platform than they used to, there will always be that window of authenticity that
100140	104620	seems to separate many of them from the personally driven passion projects. The truth is, one
104620	109340	thing that is hard to fabricate is that individual enthusiasm one has for a subject they cover,
109340	113480	and although not impossible, many large businesses simply don't see it as a required component
113480	118760	for success, and as channels like Looper, Minit Crafts, whatever they're called, and
118760	123080	the rest have shown, you really don't need that much framework on personality to succeed.
123080	126860	In fact, avoiding building any personal image ensures that they keep any components that
126860	131120	may change disposable, and that ultimately, control of the content is still centralised
131120	134960	on the people who run the channel, and not those they may outsource a variety of the
134960	138480	work to. This formula means that there is a boundary before more independent content
138480	142620	and more detached corporate presentations, however, just because there's a rule doesn't
142620	147360	mean that there aren't exceptions, particularly in the community we're focusing on today.
147360	151480	Commentary is genre that large corporations tend to avoid infiltrating, particularly given
151480	155880	the aforementioned paragraph. Having a personality is almost essential to the content you're
155880	159780	producing, even if you're merely presenting information, viewers expect at least a little
159780	163620	pizzazz. Audience members want to build a relationship based on trust with the person
163620	166680	they're listening to, how can you do that when you don't even know if there's a real
166680	170080	person behind the channel? However, this doesn't mean that there aren't some willing
170080	174720	to take the risk, and one subgenre of commentary knows this all too well, that being the Tea
174720	175720	community.
175720	181880	A popular YouTube channel is about to hit 1 million subscribers, they showed up, out
181880	186760	of nowhere, almost a year ago, and the people want to know, who is Spill?
186760	190600	A few years ago, there was a drama in the community that surrounded a channel called
190600	194880	Spill. Spill is a channel that hosts numerous videos with high production value and an astonishing
194880	199400	upload schedule given those said videos. They also hosted a syndicate of channels alongside
199400	204360	Spill, including Brew, Grill, and On The Hill. I'll speak more about them in the future,
204360	208600	but a video they uploaded covering their origin at the time had made them seem more homegrown
208600	209760	than they actually were.
209760	214680	Spill started out as a two-person passion project, one of us has a background in journalism,
214680	219100	the other has a background in illustration and video editing. We both love YouTube news
219100	223720	and drama, who doesn't? We wanted to create a channel that had a more journalistic approach
223720	229200	to YouTube drama, a thorough recap of all sides of a story with proper citations. On
229200	233900	top of that, we wanted to give something back to the community by contributing to the conversation
233900	238360	with an educational approach. And while a lot of people choose to do creative projects
238360	242960	while being self-employed, as soon as more than one person is working on a big project
242960	247000	together, it's legally the best option to register as a corporation.
247000	251360	The reality was that Spill and their accompanying channels were part of a larger company that
251360	255040	had branched out into the tea community, and although people involved with the channel
255040	258480	were actually quite interested in the stories that they covered, they weren't exactly
258480	262600	how they portrayed themselves, and that gave some in the community reason for pause.
262600	276360	Spill- So my question to you is pretty simple, who are you going to believe? Spill saying
276360	281200	that the corporation was a reaction to their 2018 YouTube channel growing, or the Canadian
281240	284420	government saying that this corporation has been around since 2013.
284420	287440	The tea community appeared to be a target for companies and content farms who had been
287440	291200	looking for a way to capitalise on the evident draw of commentary channels. What makes tea
291200	295240	channels so attractive to businesses though? Well, I think it's because they often integrate
295240	299400	reporting a factual or speculative information in a rather straightforward manner. It's
299400	302920	not difficult to grasp, but in cases like Spill, all they had to do was attempt to cut
302920	306960	out bias from the reporters themselves. So although the channel felt like a tea channel,
306960	311960	it was more over a news channel covering tea topics with a nice presentation, and any
311960	316280	attempts to add personality such as their grill channel have not attracted that much
316280	320540	attention because of it. With that in mind, the Spill family hasn't taken up too much
320540	324480	space despite their impressive collective size, and other up and coming creators have
324480	329320	still been able to carve out a niche for themselves, one of those being the subject of today, a
329320	342640	channel by the name of Anna Oop. Anna Oop is a tea channel who has grown to be one of
342640	346080	the most influential creators in her sphere, with over 2 million subscribers on her main
346080	350240	channel and nearly 4 million subscribers when counting her other channels, focusing more
350240	351240	on true crime.
351240	355400	Did you guys ever see any of the TikTok videos about Isabella? What did you think when you
355400	359240	saw them? I can't wait to read your thoughts and discussions down in the comments below.
359240	363480	Her all-American girl charm and sassy nature is well complemented by editing with real
363480	367300	personality behind it, resulting in content that appears to have captured the hearts of
367300	371400	many viewers, with her true crime content garnering popularity for being a bite-sized
371400	375960	accessible breakdown of often very complex cases. All in all, she seems to be the prime
375960	379960	example of individual success in the face of a climate that is becoming more and more
379960	384420	demanding of creators, with thousands tuning into her channels every day to hear that voice
384420	388140	and the person behind it. But what's there more to this humble 21 year old than meets
388140	391900	the eye? Well, today we're going to be doing some investigating of our own, following Anna
391900	395820	Oop's timeline, and seeing whether this success story was really as organic as it
395820	401020	seemed. Ladies, gentlemen, and all other colours on the light spectrum, let's look into the
401020	415780	mystery of inventing Anna Oop.
415780	420500	The YouTube channel for Anna Oop was created in May 2019, it's hard to re-say too much
420500	424180	about them at this point as many of their videos from back then were deleted, and I
424180	427980	do want to save a bit of information for later, but I think from the off Anna knew what sort
427980	431780	of creator she wanted to be, particularly with a name like that, which refers to a popular
431780	441180	meme that regularly circulates around the beauty and other communities.
441180	444660	The video started off quite modestly, with a star that was similar to many other tea
444660	448540	channels at the time, content that delivered information in a mostly verbally free text
448540	452540	format over copyright free soundtracks, being interspersed with the relevant clips of the
452540	456340	discourse. The topics she chose were also those which were long established to have
456340	460540	proven dividends for creators, these subjects mostly included large influences and even
460540	465500	celebrities such as Ariana Grande or Bretman Rock. Not all of these videos were necessarily
465500	469560	unbiased or journalistic, some of them were heavily opinionated, such as her videos on
469560	483020	Nikita Dragun.
483020	486540	These are all important aspects to building an individual's relationship with an audience,
486540	489940	whether it be positive or negative. There are people who like Nikita Dragun, there are
489940	493620	people who do not like Nikita Dragun, but having people who care is already half the
493620	497460	battle to engage with them with your videos. Such content drives up engagement and encourages
497460	501720	people to like, dislike, and leave their comments. However, if you're only known to be a dedicated
501720	505140	hater, then you're not really going to build much potential with your viewers, your takes
505140	509440	still need to be somewhat reasonable and elaborated from their point of view, and Anna Oop did
509440	513600	that for many people. Her strong skills in production, conveying digestible if lightweight
513600	518280	information garnered her an audience very quickly, and when I say very quickly, I mean
518280	519920	nearly immediately.
519920	524720	By the time December 2019 came around, Anna was already approaching 50,000 subscribers,
524720	528120	something that few creators could really dream of in the first eight months of their content
528120	531680	creation. But subscribers weren't the only thing she was building, most importantly,
531680	535080	she was building a rapport with those who viewed her, and she knew the importance of
535080	538480	this. She'd regularly advertise her Twitter and Instagram so she could prevent fanart
538520	542120	of herself, and was seemingly an active member of the community at this time, talking with
542120	545880	audience members and fellow creators. She had a few gimmicks as well, the most interesting
545880	549820	one was calling her viewers, and people she interacted with love, and intentional misspelling
549820	554320	of a word that could mean a term of endearment in certain places. They were building a persona
554320	559000	with identifiable yet unique characteristics, and people were tuning in for them, yet there
559000	560960	was more work to be done.
560960	564760	Heading into the new year of 2020, Anna seemed determined to take her channel to the next
564760	569040	level, and in January, she switched from the commonly used text format to using her own
569040	572360	voice. Normally, you'd think there would be more of an announcement, or at least some
572360	576660	build up to such a change in format, you'd think there could be some attention in a voice
576660	580880	reveal at least, but it seems that Anna didn't want to make a scene, and I can't blame
580880	585560	her for that. The first documented video to use her voice is the upload on Nikki's tutorials,
585560	589160	and given the subject, Anna's sombre tone appears to be appropriate.
589160	593640	Of course, many people are all pretty mad about this, and want to know who did this
593640	598740	to Nikki. There's been a lot of speculations, and some people are even accusing famous YouTubers,
598740	602560	and some of Nikki's closest friends. There were even rumours that one of the blackmailers
602560	607520	was the company Too Faced, who had previously manipulated Nikki into going into a deal with
607520	609240	them where she lost millions.
609240	613740	Although at first Anna Oop's delivery on subjects appears quite subdued, with each
613740	618060	passing month she seemed to find more and more zest when covering these topics, gradually
618060	622220	transforming into the more bold and brash character people are familiar with today.
622220	626060	However, it wasn't just what was being said on YouTube that was important to Anna, and
626060	629900	throughout the year she said about many ways that would familiarise the viewers with her
629900	630900	as a person.
630900	635900	Hi loves, your girl is back again. So today we're going to talk about Tana Mongeau's
635900	641260	infamous reality TV show on MTV, and y'all, this show really ain't it.
641260	646100	In Spring 2020, Anna's existing Twitter account was deleted, seemingly suspended, and a number
646140	649260	of videos were purged from her channel. The reason being somewhat unknown, as many of
649260	653420	these videos weren't exactly poorly performing, but it seemed to work, as the summer of 2020
653420	656700	found Anna increasing her view and subscriber count at breakneck pace.
656700	661280	However, she wasn't without her challenges. In May 2020, Anna's channel was demonetised
661280	665840	by YouTube, who cited unoriginal content being the reason Anna took to Twitter to dispute
665840	669620	this, highlighting the amount of work that she puts into her channel. Given the amount
669620	673660	of second-hand material used by T channels, this isn't a rare occurrence, as YouTube
673660	677680	often struggles to distinguish the two. Anna also used her platform to stick up for another
677680	681460	creator who found themselves in a similar situation. She also found the time to be outspoken
681460	687060	in support for social causes such as BLM, the Lebanon crisis, and LGBT rights, characterising
687060	691380	them as causes that meant a lot to her. She'd post memes, provide opinions, celebrate her
691380	695900	birthday which was on the 12th of July, and even hosted a Twitter Q&A, all of which enabled
695900	699480	her to build a closer relationship with her viewers. Some of her answers were a little
699480	703500	non-descript, but you can't expect a creator to be comfortable with giving all their personal
703500	707860	details out to the public. With that said, her favourite film series is The Hunger Games,
707860	712260	her favourite animal is a koala bear, and her favourite game is Roblox. They weren't
712260	716780	surprising details, but they were meaningful to those who supported her, and her personality
716780	718460	only became more iconic.
718460	723840	Anna Oop In the space of barely a year and a half, Anna
723840	728420	Oop had transformed the landscape of the T community into one suitable for her. Her strong
728420	732420	production value and excellent upload schedule paired with an identifiable character major
732420	736020	a force to be reckoned with, and Anna knew the importance of retaining people who cared
736020	740620	about her. She wanted people to get to know her for who she was, and she wanted people
740620	745100	to know her appreciation for them, even occasionally tweeting out love and gratitude to those who
745100	749460	helped her find success in an often challenging industry. However, Anna was number one to
749460	753620	rest on her laurels. In fact, her success had only made her more ambitious, and on the
753620	757060	3rd of December, she tweeted out that she was working on a new channel that she thought
757060	759320	her viewers were going to love.
759320	764120	What was Anna Oop cooking? Well, we're about to find out.
764120	768380	Anna Oop Not every case is the same, and plenty of
768380	772280	unsolved cases still desperately need to be solved.
772280	780560	True Crime It's really hard to think of a more significant
780560	784440	development to the YouTube community in the last few years than that of the true crime
784440	788840	genre. Now, true crime has always possessed a presence in mainstream media, it long pre-existed
789360	792720	YouTube, and will probably long outlast it. However, the storytelling aspect appears to
792720	796700	have taken its grasp in the last few years, with many creators garnering millions of subscribers
796700	800400	for their coverage of criminal cases, solved and unsolved. There's always been a bit
800400	804120	of stigma around the inclusion of such topics, particularly given the fact that it's being
804120	808560	published to potentially millions of people, and some would rather have it out of the spotlight.
808560	812640	Nonetheless, the consensus seems to be that if these topics are treated with the due amount
812640	816280	of respect, then there is a place for them. Interestingly, there seems to be a decent
816280	820400	overlap between tea and beauty communities, and true crime, with some true crime creators
820400	824400	having beauty roots, with some still integrating it into their videos, and it seems that Anna
824400	828560	pertained that same penchant for the morbid. It was clear that by the end of December,
828560	839240	her new channel was going to be true crime related. The first video was uploaded on the
839240	843240	5th of January, it followed the story of a TikToker who had slain his neighbours for
843240	848400	It was a suitably macabre topic, though Anna's voice does take a bit of getting used to in
848400	852480	this context. Honestly, she sounded more bad when she was talking about Nicky tutorials.
852480	856280	According to Zach's public defence lawyers, the video shows her telling the neighbours
856280	859700	to get off their property. She told them that they'd better back up, because they were
859700	863800	not going to like what's coming out of the house. Sounds like a threat, right?
863800	867160	Nonetheless, the video was well received, and accumulates a strong view count, with
867160	872080	the channel approaching 100,000 subscribers in the space of a few days, a surprising statistic
872080	876080	all things considered, but it must have reflected the strong cult of personality that someone
876080	880280	like Anna Oop had built, and in the next months, she continued to upload consistently on the
880280	883840	Anna Solve channel. Pretty impressive considering that she still had her main channel to run
883840	888000	as well, and in spite of what may have appeared as time constraints, she also managed to maintain
888000	892200	an upload schedule on there as well. Fortunately, most of these videos were limited to approximately
892200	896200	10 minutes at most, which likely allowed her to divide her time fairly evenly between the
896200	899360	two projects. However, although she was still experiencing growth on her main channel, the
899360	902960	true crime one appeared to be experiencing the greatest proportional success, accruing
902960	907720	over 300,000 subscribers by the time April came around. Now, such impressive statistics,
907720	910840	you might expect one to consolidate their achievements, and focus on how to make sure
910840	914900	that such levels of commitment can be preserved, but Anna had different ideas, and on June
914900	919140	of the same year, launched another channel, this one called Anna Horror Stories, which
919140	924080	as the name implies, comprises of Anna recounting the rather unnerving tales of others, that
924080	927200	recently has pivoted towards more list-style content.
927200	931360	Nonetheless, another channel, I mean, I respect the commitment to the grind, but it seems
931360	935520	like a lot to keep at, though, to be fair, this channel's content didn't seem the highest
935520	939600	effort either. The writing is someone else's, and the footage is pretty standard, Anna may
939600	943600	have just been looking to make a pretty penny. However, barely a couple weeks after the first
943600	948120	upload on this channel, Anna was back on Twitter again, polling people for her next channel,
948120	951260	asking what a good name would be, and quote tweeting another person saying that this would
951260	955280	be looking more into the psychological side of criminal behaviour. On the surface, it's
955280	959580	not unfeasible, but it's certainly surprising given Anna has no apparent background in criminal
959580	963800	psychology, she already has a true crime channel, and more than enough on her plate to worry
963800	967840	about. It seemed like a lot to be planning ahead for, when she barely had any opportunity
967840	971680	to gauge the amount of time she'd be able to balance between her already active three
971680	976320	channels and an additional fourth one, but maybe she really was just that inspired.
976320	980200	However, this idea appeared to stagnate a little, and developments over the coming months
980200	983740	stalled, with a tweet at the start of September explaining that her lack of activity on social
983740	987500	media was due to some personal stuff she'd been going through, and with all things considered
987500	992000	this was understandable. Her status as a large influencer had landed her in some drama, probably
992000	996140	the most notable example of this was her feud with that vegan teacher, a controversial figure
996140	1000560	whose promotion of veganism has been overshadowed by her altercations with other online figures,
1000560	1002300	and accompanying contentious remarks.
1002300	1013440	Anna's responses weren't the most intellectual, sometimes merely consisting to the genius
1013440	1017880	content of eating a burger, but that vegan teacher was an easy target, and it allowed
1017880	1040120	Anna to repeatedly dunk on a person who'd already been widely lampooned by the internet.
1040120	1044240	If I found this drama interesting, I'd probably say more, but it at least established a more
1044240	1048640	queen side to Anna Oop, and persisted for the rest of the year. Although drama isn't
1048640	1052440	known to be the most fun to be involved in, Anna seemed to capitalise on the opportunity
1052440	1056200	to make sassy comments about all those who were hating on her, all while continuing to
1056200	1060640	upload consistently on her channels, and initiating work on other projects, including launching
1060640	1064960	a Roblox channel which would allow audiences to game with her. Additionally, she finally
1064960	1068480	launched the Anna Uncovered channel, the first video being uploaded at the end of November
1068480	1084520	with a runtime of 18 minutes.
1084520	1089720	However, the zenith of her online career appeared to be approaching in December of 2021.
1089720	1093760	There had long been questions about the person behind Anna Oop's channel, and a face reveal
1093760	1098800	had long been sought after by the most dedicated viewers of her channel. Anna teased this before,
1098800	1103520	but with her hitting 2 million subscribers, it felt like a celebration was in order. Anna
1103520	1108000	continued to drop a variety of hints and clues to all that would be revealed, seemingly with
1108000	1113040	a song titled Face Reveal, which really could only imply one thing, especially given the
1113040	1117240	teaser trailers that were posted by Anna herself. Finally, people would have a face to put to
1117240	1121600	this commentator, and viewers were excited, but on the 3rd of December, the video for
1121600	1138640	Face Reveal was uploaded, and people were in shock.
1138640	1168240	What the fuck was that?
1168240	1171380	Anna Oop's Face Reveal contains a series of call-outs to other creators who she has
1171380	1175280	previously clashed with and spoken about, but the only person really being the subject
1175280	1179840	of any criticism during this video was her. Face Reveal was broadly ridicule for its sub-par
1179840	1184020	production quality and delivery, but also for the simple fact that it did not contain
1184020	1188360	a face reveal. In the video itself, Anna says she wishes she could, but clearly felt that
1188360	1192200	it was not the appropriate time, and later expands on this on Twitter, saying that she
1192200	1196280	was going to, but afraid that she would have to deal with too much negativity. I don't
1196280	1200540	understand, I suppose, but why would you make a video titled Face Reveal in the first
1200540	1205240	place then, if the whole point of it was not to reveal your face? Well, Anna said she thought
1205240	1208880	it was just gonna be a fun little goof. It's hard to buy that someone as algorithmically
1208880	1213720	adept as Anna would not know the implications of advertising a face reveal on an otherwise
1213720	1217740	faceless channel, but maybe this stress from other drama had just impacted her judgement
1217740	1221880	a little, and yet, a few days before this, she had just launched another channel?
1222280	1226720	On top of this y'all, Anna Hoop is also known for her problematic personality. She's been
1226720	1231720	in scandal after scandal, constantly getting into drama herself, I mean, I think it's
1231720	1234320	about time we see Anna actually do a video on herse-
1234320	1235320	Oh.
1235320	1238960	This was just too much for one person, and surely she was spreading herself incredibly
1238960	1243640	thin by doing so, and not too long after, this theory may well have been proven correct.
1243640	1247040	Now there had always been stigma around Anna's channel, but a lot of the criticisms up to
1247040	1251680	a point were quite subjective, her opinions were poorly formed, her attitude was annoying,
1251680	1255640	and her content was clickbaiting. They may have all held some validity, but that doesn't
1255640	1259360	tend to make a particularly eye-catching discussion to those outside of the sphere.
1259360	1263360	However, a couple weeks after face reveal, Anna put out an interesting post on her Twitter
1263360	1267040	and YouTube community tab, complaining that a person had copyright struck her without
1267040	1271240	justification or ownership of content that she had been uploading. She also singled out
1271240	1274920	the channel that had copyright struck her, a channel by the name of Truthful Reality,
1274920	1278640	another true crime creator who had covered some of these same stories before Anna. On
1278640	1283000	superficial inspection, one can't necessarily claim ownership of topics, and a strike on
1283000	1287920	a channel for doing so would be wholly unjustified. However, as Anna's tweet and YouTube community
1287920	1292100	post began to pick up traction, a growing backlash from viewers began to form, many
1292100	1296400	of whom stating that Truthful Reality had claimed footage that he personally owned and
1296400	1301480	published solely, and Anna had directly lifted this without any transformative value, not
1301480	1306000	quite the story that Anna had told. Viewers also did not appreciate the fact that Anna
1306000	1310420	linked his channel, and although not accompanied by any direct call to action, the risk of
1310420	1314600	harassment from an emotionally charged post like this was always present, with some even
1314600	1318360	claiming that Anna had purposefully ignored any chance to peacefully resolve this matter
1318360	1323160	privately, only now taking umbrage after actions were taken against her channel. I suppose
1323160	1327000	it's in the nature of some more irreverent people in the community to behave this way,
1327000	1331400	but this is Anna's soul, not Anna Oop, and many people who are part of these communities
1331400	1336460	think that respect is an inherent part of creating content in this genre, but that appeared
1336460	1338120	to be just the tip of the iceberg.
1338120	1343420	About a few days before all this, a post had gone up on Reddit entitled Anna Oop aka Anna
1343420	1347780	Solve's At It Again, which documented the alleged plagiarism from a YouTuber named Mr.
1347780	1352000	Ballum, a channel with millions of subscribers. It was clear that this video had been removed
1352000	1355280	very promptly from Anna's channel following call-outs from commenters, and any of its
1355280	1359560	presence had been long erased. Additionally, about a few days after the Anna Solve channel
1359560	1363200	went live, a couple of comments appeared on her Twitter requesting her to refrain from
1363200	1367720	stealing content. That was in January, and now we were in December. It seems that rumours
1367720	1371360	have been circulating regarding stolen content on this channel for a while, but it only seemed
1371360	1375640	to surface when Anna herself decided to publicly attack another creator for what they perceived
1375640	1380440	as an unjust copyright strike. I can't really comment on the legality of the copyright strike,
1380440	1384720	as it can be a very grey area, but it definitely shone a light on what many perceived to be
1384720	1389200	extensively lazy reporting from a creator who was not actually putting time into these
1389200	1393640	cases that they deserved. Claims of plagiarism are not that common, particularly given that
1393640	1397440	the cases themselves can be sourced from a lot of places, so this occurring twice in
1397440	1401960	the span of a very short time was a red flag for some viewers. Some of the concerns appeared
1401960	1405800	to address the idea that Anna didn't pronounce the names of people involved correctly, and
1405800	1409560	regularly made errors in reporting information. This is all important in the narrative of
1409560	1413620	stolen content, as a person who lifts content may not be familiar with the subject enough
1413620	1417960	to possess this knowledge, and will therefore make errors in reporting the actual details,
1417960	1421080	copying content, without actually understanding the subtext.
1421080	1426480	Today, we're going to talk about Nikocado Avocado disrespecting Veronica Vang.
1426480	1430960	I had come across this a few times when researching a few of Anna Oop's main channel videos,
1430960	1434720	and tried not to pay too much mind to it, as I've made more than enough pronunciation
1434720	1438640	and semantic errors in my time, but there was still something strange about certain
1438640	1443240	mistakes that struck me off as somebody supposedly so involved in the beauty community. Like,
1443240	1446800	how could you spell Jacqueline that way when you've literally used the correct spelling
1446800	1450900	in the title? It just didn't make sense. I'd read rumours that the reason for this
1450900	1455040	was to drive up impressions by having people correct you in the comments, and although
1455040	1458880	it's impossible to confirm, it's certainly something to consider with channels this supposedly
1458880	1462880	deliberate, and particularly relevant with Anna's true crime channels, where such shortcomings
1462880	1465640	could be perceived as seriously disrespectful.
1465640	1469160	Given Anna Oop's upload schedule, it seems that her final choice was to drop the matter
1469160	1474160	entirely and just create more videos, which she did. In fact, approaching the end of 2022,
1474160	1478280	between her now five channels, she was uploading nearly every day. The tweet regarding truth
1478280	1482100	for reality was deleted, and no content that was subject to the copyright claims was ever
1482100	1486720	restored to her channel. However, this situation did place a mark over the genuinity of her
1486720	1491280	content, and made people wonder how much of her channel was original. After all, it wouldn't
1491280	1495360	be the first time that this was called into question. Anna Oop's videos were well produced,
1495360	1499200	they looked nice, they had eye-catching titles and thumbnails, and love her or hate her,
1499200	1503760	Anna had a personality that provoked a response from audiences. She had a lot going for her,
1503760	1507840	it wouldn't have taken that much to do just a bit more research to avoid errors and any
1507840	1511480	risk of lifting other people's content. Yet all that was being put on the line for
1511480	1515440	videos that Anna didn't need or have to create. It didn't make sense for a person
1515440	1521100	to behave this way, it didn't make sense for a person to behave this way. Anna's face
1521100	1526440	reveal may not have gone exactly as many would have expected it to, but by the end of 2021,
1526440	1530480	many felt they had a better view of Anna Oop's face than they ever did before, with some
1530480	1535840	wondering whether there even was a face in the first place. Well, it wasn't long before
1535840	1542320	alternative theories began emerging, alongside some pretty damning evidence.
1542320	1546800	Now the trail of breadcrumbs seem to point out to this channel, who we are going to lovingly
1546800	1552000	call Team Anna Hoopoo-Poo-Poo-Poo-Poo-Poo-Poo-Poo-Poo.
1560480	1567000	Now there are always theories floating around surrounding the identity of Anna Oop, not
1567000	1570620	necessarily people wishing to have all her personal details, who are asking the question
1570620	1575520	whether she really was a legitimate individual content creator. However, without real evidence
1575520	1579560	proving one way or the other, all you could do was speculate. There are plenty of alternative
1579560	1584240	explanations, perhaps Anna just outsources a large amount of her work and enjoys a feeling
1584240	1588920	of being super productive, it's not impossible. Outsourcing doesn't necessarily undermine
1588920	1592600	the individuality of a channel as long as they still have a personal connection to what
1592600	1597600	they do. Maybe Anna Oop just really likes money or algorithmic success, they may not
1597600	1602280	be the most noble reasons, but that also wouldn't change her personal identity or connection
1602280	1606680	to the channel. Anna had once claimed to have watched old videos critical of her, even showing
1606680	1610640	one which outwardly shows the thumbnail claiming her channel was a company, so she must have
1610640	1612160	been aware of these discussions.
1612160	1617020	Don't ask, I've already seen all the hate videos about me on YouTube, but let me remind
1617020	1620860	you that my only job here is to entertain y'all, and that's why your girl decided
1620860	1622940	to launch my new channel, AnnaPlays.
1622940	1627340	However, the drama surrounding the copyright strike did ring a few alarm bells. A large
1627340	1631380	majority of creators still want to be proud of the work they attach their brand name to,
1631380	1635340	even if there are significant contributions from other parties, but Anna's posts seem
1635340	1640260	to convey a lack of understanding of how this copyright strike even came about. They say
1640260	1645040	it was for no reason at all. Even if you didn't edit the content yourself, the first thing
1645040	1649520	you'd do is try and establish exactly why this happened. Anna is obviously aware this
1649520	1653760	isn't just some random bloke or corporation trying to cash in on her content because she
1653760	1658520	links his channel. This is another true crime YouTuber who probably cares about his reputation
1658520	1662280	as well, so there was clearly some motive behind the strike, whether you think that
1662280	1667080	was justified or not, but Anna couldn't put two and two together, which is very strange
1667080	1668080	indeed.
1668080	1671480	They had been murmuring since then that there was more to this story, including an earlier
1671480	1675680	comment that alleged that Anna had ignored attempts to reconcile the matter in private,
1675680	1679240	but ultimately the story appeared to fizzle out. However, there were other developments
1679240	1684140	that were going on in the nearby drag race community that would throw the case wide open,
1684140	1685840	so let's go there now briefly.
1685840	1691840	Hey queens! Some people found this dig from Carmen to be a little out of line, because
1691840	1697780	Gottmik's appearance on the show was a big deal. Regardless of the fact that Mick identifies
1697780	1701940	as male, having a trans queen on the season was huge.
1701940	1706280	This is Butterface, they're a channel that operates in the drag race community that follows
1706280	1712020	the famous RuPaul show of the same name. On the 1st of January 2022, another channel by
1712020	1717420	the name of TopRPDRVideos uploaded a video accusing Butterface of ripping their content
1717420	1722460	without providing any credit, subsequently profiting off the success of this content.
1722460	1727140	In our case, this channel went as far as using parts of our videos instead of hunting down
1727140	1732220	the original material itself, like it happened with this channel not so long ago, which
1732220	1735660	is not only immoral, it's also very much illegal.
1735660	1739260	Butterface then put out a response to this video, and although apologising for any use
1739260	1743580	of the original creator's material, denied that they were a content farm of any sorts,
1743580	1747780	with a fully documented backstory and a variety of inspirations for their channel. However,
1747780	1752460	this was further taken apart by TopRPDRVideos and the community as a whole, ripping into
1752460	1757020	the inconsistencies and insincerity of such a post, with further evidence that the channel
1757020	1758700	was merely a content farm.
1758700	1763060	Meanwhile, a channel called Gringey popped up in my comment section. He took a break
1763060	1767780	from YouTube. He says his videos were stolen as well.
1767780	1771260	And if I was sad before, now I'm starting to get a little bit upset.
1771260	1777180	Oh, wait a moment, what the hell is this? I'm lucky Wao hasn't noticed. No legal team,
1777180	1782700	they don't mind me. They don't mind you? Didn't you just say, oh, no, no, no, no, no, sorry.
1782700	1786760	That was part of the introductory spin on the narrative designed to gain more sympathy
1786760	1791580	before trying to perform some good old character assassination.
1791580	1794360	Emotions over facts, people. Emotions over facts.
1794360	1798260	There was one key detail amongst this all that piqued the interest of onlookers from
1798260	1802800	T-channels, and that was the accusation of the involvement of Anna Oop.
1802800	1807960	It seems like Team Anna Oop, being a famous YouTuber with millions of subscribers, thought
1807960	1813920	it would be nice to help her friend Team Butterface with her own channel, not by, you know, inviting
1813920	1819480	her on her channel, do collaboration, helping her develop her reputation and the connection
1819480	1823680	with her viewership, like we have basically seen happening everywhere else on YouTube
1823680	1828640	since its inception. No, no, no, no. She helped by designing her thumbnail.
1828640	1832520	Yes, in Butterface posts, they credit a close friend for helping them get their channel
1832520	1837960	off the ground. They don't say who, but TopRPDRvideo seems pretty certain that this special someone
1837960	1841920	is Anna Oop. Although there is no solidified evidence to confirm this beyond a shadow of
1841920	1846160	a doubt, it's certainly planted a seed for people to start digging, and not too long
1846160	1849520	after, another creator appeared on the scene, Paige Christie.
1849520	1852480	Paige Christie Today, we are talking about another bustling
1852480	1855960	content farm called Anna Oop.
1855960	1860080	Page Christie is a commentator who has covered the topic of content farms before, most notably
1860080	1864040	the Spill saga that followed a similar storyline. She had already expressed her doubts over
1864040	1868800	the legitimacy of both Anna Oop and Butterface's channels earlier on in the previous year,
1868800	1872040	and now seemed to have the evidence to prove that they were both connected.
1872040	1874880	Paige Christie Butterface's first video, and underneath
1874880	1880040	their first video, which is every single time Monet X Change came for Tamisha Iman, which
1880040	1886600	was posted on the 16th of June 2021, there was a comment. A comment left by Anna Oop,
1886600	1890480	and the comment read as follows. Hi guys, I see some of y'all are commenting
1890480	1896520	that my friend is copying me. I love the art of drag, and so does my friend, and when they
1896520	1900960	said they were interested in making a channel, I wanted to help out where I could, so I helped
1900960	1905800	them with the thumbnail design, gave them some editing tips. Please, no hate to them.
1905800	1913140	P.S. I love butter, this video goes off. Butterface responded with, thank you queen, I probably
1913140	1917460	should have mentioned somewhere that you gave me some tips. I completely understand everyone's
1917460	1922520	concerns in the comments. Love you too. And this comment, can I just say, has since
1922520	1930200	been deleted. The admission that the thumbnails were created at that point by Anna Oop was
1930200	1934320	all I needed to then go and do some dirty investigation.
1934320	1939000	This is pretty damning information, particularly when combined with the collective research prior.
1939000	1943240	It proved that there was an undeniable connection between Butterface and Anna Oop, and if Butterface
1943240	1947000	was indeed as corporate as they appear to be, then unless they fooled Anna too, there
1947000	1951360	was no real alternative explanation for how such a scenario could have transpired. If
1951360	1955560	Anna truly was a friend, then unfortunately that friend was a business. I assume this
1955560	1959200	was a shock to some, but I think most who followed the situation were just waiting for
1959200	1964080	their suspicions to be confirmed. The truth was that we were seeing one person supposedly
1964080	1969360	pumping out up to an hour of highly produced yet fundamentally hollow content every week.
1969360	1972600	It simultaneously was too bad, and too good to be true.
1972600	1977840	Butterface is not returned, and I think it's because they know that they don't goof, because
1977840	1982560	the comments underneath a lot of people are beginning to realize that this is a conglomerate,
1982560	1986840	and especially when it comes down to straight up stealing other people's content, this is
1986840	1989260	now majorly overstepping a line.
1989260	1992840	The evidence had been stacking up for a while, but with all of it accumulating in one place,
1992840	1997140	it enabled people to understand the depth of this masquerade. Behind it, a very telling
1997140	2001560	story about Anna Oop, that this person who would use their status as a self-proclaimed
2001560	2005880	human being to tell stories, plead their case with YouTube on multiple occasions, and even
2005880	2010500	talk about personal challenges going on in their life was simply not a person at all,
2010500	2015320	and there was no way that anyone involved had merely accidentally acted like an individual.
2015320	2019820	This was a fully committed facade, filled to the brim with first-person pronouns. They
2019820	2023240	knew what they were doing, and they were making a killing from it.
2023240	2026480	But who were they? Well, there was still a little more to uncover.
2026480	2038660	One channel that kept coming up when I would do a thumbnail search for thumbnails that
2038660	2045540	look similar to it was a channel called Rumored. Then I went into Rumored's featured channels,
2045540	2049800	and I came across another channel called This Happened. As you can see, they all have the
2049800	2055000	same thumbnail style. And then from This Happened, I went and checked out their featured channels
2055000	2060960	tab, and would you look at it, there are some people there that we should recognise.
2060960	2064880	One person called Anna Uncovered, in Paige's video, she showed that there appeared to be
2064880	2068760	a nexus of channels connected to each other. Some of these were channels that did masquerade
2068760	2072600	as individual creators, whereas others were presented under the more corporate pretense.
2072600	2076700	However, on researching one of the channel's URLs, Paige found something else.
2076700	2080560	Is that all of the rest of the channels did not have a customised HTML, so their YouTube
2080560	2086640	HTML is youtube.com forward slash c forward slash Daniel O Games. Daniel with the O being
2086640	2093280	massive games, uppercase S, lowercase s. So one of the jobs it shows is female voice artists
2093280	2098260	for big celeb channels, as well as the second one that was posted 29th of November, which
2098260	2103280	is an American female voice artist for a celeb channel. So the advert reads as follows, they
2103280	2108960	need 10 freelancers. Hello, we are a company called Video Creation Hub. We own several
2108960	2113800	YouTube channels, and one of them is in the celebrity niche. To give you an example of
2113800	2118360	the style of work that we're after, check out these channels, and one of them is the
2118360	2122700	channel This Happened, and the other channel is Pop Juice. This layered down a further
2122700	2127460	rabbit hole which revealed two companies, Creolone and Video Creation Hub, both of whom
2127460	2134240	specialised in one thing, YouTube automation. So O works for Video Creation Hub, which are
2134240	2140280	the people who created this Upwork advert. And on LinkedIn, they state that they are
2140280	2144720	a content writer, a freelance writer, and a contributing writer. But not only do they
2144720	2150000	work for the Video Creation Hub, they also work for another company called Creolone Media.
2150000	2155160	So the Video Creation Hub essentially is a company that considers YouTube profiles as
2155160	2160320	real estate. They do something that they call YouTube automation. In essence, these companies
2160320	2164240	are specially designed to build and consolidate large channels and their fanbases. They now
2164240	2170200	have to communicate with the Gen Z mind. They don't really list their techniques on
2170200	2174040	the page, trade secrets I suppose, but then again, I feel at this point it's somewhat
2174040	2179020	evident. So this began to paint another very different picture. There may actually be individuals
2179020	2182880	behind the channels themselves, but the production comes from a third-party company who turns
2182880	2187200	that concept into a content farm. Page then provides further evidence to support this,
2187200	2189600	and it begins to look a bit dystopian, honestly.
2189600	2194880	An editor from Blank. Passionate about music, entertainment, writing, Dee has put her love
2194880	2201200	for them together, and specialises in music and entertainment journalism. Currently, Dee
2201200	2206080	is a scriptwriter at Creolone Media Group, where she writes several scripts a week for
2206080	2208960	the Butterface YouTube channel.
2208960	2213480	Creolone Media appears to be aiming for a plethora of genres in the coming months, advertising
2213480	2218640	roles in channels relating to soccer, text phase horror, rap music. They are essentially
2218640	2222400	shooting for world domination, or the next best thing. This was daunting.
2222400	2229680	These people essentially create entire automated channels with voiceover artists, with writers,
2229680	2238480	with researchers, with editors, with thumbnail creators, with graphic designers, with producers,
2238480	2243320	with literally just everything it is that you could possibly need to have a channel
2243320	2244320	and make it run.
2244320	2248080	Though there was very little to add at the end of Page's video, she channels the frustration
2248080	2251720	of an individual creator who sees many of her peers struggling to keep up with the sort
2251720	2256200	of farm that companies like Creolone and Video Creation Hub are operating. Not necessarily
2256200	2259960	being bothered by their existence, but more about the lie that they wanted to present
2259960	2263800	themselves as one of us. Page also made a follow up video where she briefly spoke to
2263800	2267080	truth for reality, and gave his side of the story more attention as well.
2267080	2271480	Yeah, I reached out to her on two occasions. I wasn't going to strike the videos, I just
2271480	2275720	wanted her to credit my work. No response. So then they tried to threaten me through
2275720	2280400	emails with a lawyer. The whole thing is a joke. It really wasn't that serious to me.
2280400	2286080	So then I asked him if he had a copy of the email that was sent by Anna Solves, and he
2286080	2290480	basically said to me, he said that he doesn't have it, and that the account that they emailed
2290480	2296160	from tried to email him a PDF file. He says that those are often used for malicious attacks,
2296160	2300840	so he blocked the account and erased the entire thread. So take that information whichever
2300840	2305960	way you want to. I'm more inclined to believe this young man, only because it's not just
2305960	2311400	him who's saying it. There are several people echoing the same sentiment, and several people
2311400	2317120	who came over to my video unprovoked to tell me the exact same thing, that Anna Solves
2317120	2319880	steals content from other content creators.
2319880	2323920	This was arguably the most serious claim relating to the drama, and certainly asked more of
2323920	2327680	the companies behind the channels. It also placed the ball firmly in the court of Anna
2327680	2331400	Oop Butterface and the rest of the channel syndicates. However, their response was more
2331400	2335720	to erase evidence. As noted in Paige's video, the comment from Anna was quickly deleted
2335720	2339240	after it was discovered. The video that comment appeared on was subsequently set to private
2339240	2343120	as well, and a large majority of leads that Paige followed in her video were removed or
2343120	2347200	hidden. Although Anna would later use the phrase, are videos on Twitter, this seems
2347200	2351880	to be the closest that there is to an acknowledgement that this is more than one person. However,
2351880	2356400	in a way, sometimes a lack of response can be considered a response in itself. Outside
2356400	2360520	of the occasional tweet, Anna Oop's social media accounts largely fell silent. They stopped
2360520	2364080	posting on their community tab altogether on each of their channels, and just returned
2364080	2369880	to the regular upload schedule. Anna Oop still has a personality, unfortunately, but outside
2369880	2373960	of the content, there is no real attempt to build a fanbase. AnnaPlays, the channel that
2373960	2377660	was designed to cultivate a closer relationship between the channel and the audience, uploaded
2377660	2382480	their last video in May 2022, and has been dormant since. Interestingly, not nearly a
2382480	2387180	month after, another channel returned to the platform, Butterface, with a video about drag
2387180	2391540	queen drama. What a surprise. Their video on the topic of a queen pretending to be a
2391540	2396300	ready to defend themselves was at least somewhat ironic, but the description was what was even
2396300	2400620	more interesting. Here they drop the guise of being an individual person, and admit that
2400620	2405220	they are operated by a company, and realise the ethical qualms of behaving in such a way.
2405220	2408840	They want to do better, and have since adapted to a more corporate format to distinguish
2408840	2412980	themselves from other individual creators. This wouldn't have been a bad response if
2412980	2417540	this had been their first response. Unfortunately, they already had one shot at explaining themselves,
2417540	2421220	and many people considered this apology to be a result of their failure to maintain the
2421220	2425480	masquerade. I think the apology also rang hollow in the greater sense as well, because
2425480	2428980	other channels that were seemingly friends with Butterface, and were ruined to be a part
2428980	2433340	of this syndicate, most notably Anna Oop, were still using personal branding to do just
2433340	2437960	what Butterface admitted to be unethical. But sometimes, friends have different opinions
2437960	2438960	I suppose.
2438960	2441100	Anna Oop I'm sorry, but why does every Kardashian
2441100	2446020	or Jenner out there try to ruin their memes by profiting off them, and reusing them over
2446020	2447020	and over again?
2447020	2449260	TRO Nonetheless, the apology did serve as strong
2449260	2452820	confirmation for the broader theory surrounding these channels, and ultimately proved that
2452820	2457100	no matter what was hidden, the explanation remained the same. Anna Oop was not who they
2457100	2461100	said they were, and they were just one of the many channels that began to infiltrate
2461100	2465620	and create a sphere. Who knows what these channels are, or if we can even identify them,
2465620	2469660	but regardless, if Butterface or Anna Oop's presence meant anything, it meant that they
2469660	2470660	were already here.
2470660	2473940	It's a pretty simple observation to make, but I think what bothered people the most
2473940	2477820	was just the lie in the first place. It's not like this was the only way for corporate
2477820	2481860	channels to survive in the 21st century, there is more than enough proof you can thrive in
2481860	2485220	your own space regardless of who owns you, and there are more than enough successful
2485220	2489140	channels to demonstrate that. They just wanted a piece of the pie, and it makes sense in
2489140	2490140	a way.
2490140	2493700	Personally fronted YouTube channels have far better audience retention, compare a channel
2493700	2500420	like Anna Oop with Pop Juice. Pop Juice presently has 129 million views with 220,000 subscribers,
2500420	2505660	Anna Oop had 440,000 subscribers with half the amount of cumulative views. The whole
2505660	2509480	reason retention is higher is because viewers think you're a real person, which might
2509480	2513140	be considered a bit of a deal breaker when you're not.
2513140	2522340	So who is the real Anna Oop?
2522340	2526220	As we kinda found out already, there's certainly a degree of deception involved in the curation
2526220	2529940	of these channels, but when establishing the timeline for this situation, you'll realise
2529940	2533440	there are more smoke and mirrors that had not been accounted for. Let's start from
2533440	2537820	the top with one simple factoid that we know to be true, Anna Oop's channel was launched
2537820	2542260	on the 12th of May 2019. That makes sense in this timeline given the channel's subsequent
2542260	2546740	success in the following years. However, we also know that around the start of 2020,
2546740	2550740	Anna Oop conducted an overhaul on their channel, their social media accounts, and a large number
2550740	2555500	of videos were subsequently deleted. I can't give you the exact reason why without speculation,
2555500	2559180	but I did say I would return to this point, and that's because there is something interesting
2559180	2563140	about their original Twitter that has been preserved, and that is the use of plural pronouns
2563140	2567360	to describe their channel. At first when I found it, I assumed that it could be a typo,
2567360	2571180	but it kept appearing, and appearing, and appearing, to a point where I assumed that
2571180	2575440	it must have been intentional. Anna Oop started out as a corporate channel that knew to an
2575440	2579540	extent it was just that. Although there seemed to be an individual person assigned to their
2579540	2584460	social media, the channel was quite transparent about it being more than one person. However,
2584460	2588620	by May 2020, this had completely changed, and even their YouTube description read that
2588620	2592660	they were a 21 year old girl from America, which I always found such a strange detail
2592660	2596260	to include in their channel because I don't think that many people could care enough about
2596260	2600780	their about page to update it with every passing birthday. I switched to voiceovers that start
2600780	2605180	the new year also changed the game with respect to how Anna operated. They moved towards this
2605180	2608740	more personal bond with their audience, and began to integrate things like birthdays,
2608740	2612940	Q&As, things that would draw people in. It was the next step of the business model. This
2612940	2617020	one didn't raise too many abject suspicions at the time because it seemed like a natural
2617020	2620700	progression, revealing something personal about yourself, it all seemed fair and square.
2620700	2624780	However, with the next step, the expansion, some more evidence of suspicious behaviour
2624780	2625780	emerges.
2625780	2631060	So their YouTube HTML is youtube.com forward slash c forward slash Daniel O Games. Daniel
2631060	2635780	with the O being massive, games, uppercase S, lowercase s.
2635780	2640540	When watching Betty Page's video, I was surprised when she mentioned Popjuice's URL, that being
2640540	2645800	of Danielo Games. I struggle to rethink what Danielo and his games had to do with a social
2645800	2650020	media channel covering trending topics, but more interestingly, I'd noticed this when
2650020	2655280	researching the Anna franchise earlier on in the day. What do I mean by this? The interesting
2655280	2659760	detail about Anna's secondary projects is that Anna Solve's, Anna Uncovered, and
2659760	2664380	Anna Horror Story's channels were seemingly founded before Anna Oop's own channel was.
2664380	2668800	This wasn't something dubious beyond doubt, plenty of people of old channels may revamp
2668800	2673180	for content production, but it certainly made one curious, and then you go to the archives
2673180	2677280	of these channels, and on each of these accounts you will find an old screenshot of the channel
2677280	2681680	belonging to someone who seemingly has no relation to Anna Oop whatsoever. These channels
2681680	2686220	typically display around a five-figure subscriber count, and seemingly all relate to Hispanic
2686220	2690120	content creators, which are also found to be a very strange connection, so it appears
2690120	2694360	the people behind the Anna Oop channel purchased these channels as they believed it would maximise
2694360	2698640	their chances for subscriber growth, which also explains why Anna was so close to reaching
2698640	2703320	100,000 subscribers so soon after their first video on the Anna Solve channel.
2703320	2707400	However, when returning to this theory today, I hit a roadblock, because the Anna Horror
2707400	2712040	Story's channel that I pulled up said it was created in June 2021, which would have
2712040	2715980	been around the time the channel went live. I took a moment to wonder whether I'd just
2715980	2719800	made a mistake, it wouldn't be the first time, but I thought I'd retrace my steps
2719800	2724600	to the tweet promoting the channel. I followed the link on the tweets, and then it hit me.
2724600	2730160	There are two different Anna Horror Story's channels. Has anyone ever noticed this? It
2730160	2734600	appears the second Anna Horror Story's channel had picked up where the first one left off.
2734600	2738520	I was mobbing on the first channel in May, and resuming on the second channel in June.
2738520	2742600	My guess would be monetisation issues as I didn't see any ads on the first channel,
2742600	2747000	but it's still an utterly bizarre situation. Normally you'd expect Anna to take to Twitter,
2747000	2750980	but there's just this strange period of radio silence, and no evidence that they ever attempted
2750980	2754820	to have the lack of monetisation on that channel changed, which is also surprising given they
2754820	2758720	regularly complain to YouTube when they feel they've been maltreated. Perhaps this time
2758720	2762280	they kinda knew what they were doing was wrong and didn't want to attract attention to
2762280	2766640	it, but that's just a guess. Beyond the assumption these channels were bought, I mean I doubt
2766640	2770680	Anna was also a male Mexican gamer in their spare time, the Anna Horror Story's channel's
2770680	2774600	URL was advertised in a forum a few weeks before the Anna Horror Story's channel was
2774600	2777360	launched. The link speaks for itself.
2777360	2781000	Now on principle I don't really mind people trading accounts, people can cultivate what
2781000	2785160	they want and pass it on for all I care, however buying accounts often does beat a very dangerous
2785160	2788940	side of YouTube, the one where people hack accounts to sell them on. I'm sure we all
2788940	2793800	know creatives had their channel turned into a Tesla fan page recently, it's not fun.
2793800	2797080	And although I doubt the team behind Anna Oop is hacking these channels themselves,
2797080	2800040	it definitely speaks to the corporate approach of content farms they wouldn't consider the
2800040	2803880	trade they're participating in. In the case of the Anna Horror Story's channel, despite
2803880	2807340	previously being a Spanish speaking channel, it was being advertised by an American or
2807340	2811680	Canadian user whose approval for monetisation message was written in English. It's not
2811680	2815900	evidence beyond a doubt because Spanish speaking people do live in America, but it's food
2815900	2819860	for thought, yet it's not something that Anna's team would ever think or care about
2819860	2821140	themselves.
2821140	2824340	As they expanded, they assumed they'd hire more and more people for these channels, and
2824340	2828620	having less ability to actually critically stay in touch with the content they were creating.
2828620	2832040	In a way, ironically, this worked somewhat to their advantage, whereas a channel like
2832040	2836420	Spill's content drew suspicion for being too good for a single person, Anna Oop and
2836420	2840020	their accompanying channels never had to worry about that, they occupied this position where
2840020	2844140	they could pull off the act of being human through what appeared to be human error. So
2844140	2847700	just because something's human doesn't mean it's good. In the meantime, their social
2847700	2851820	media started drawing with a variety of creators, especially easy targets that would embolden
2851820	2855740	their status in the community, calling out others and using a face reveal bait to launch
2855740	2860460	a distract on their detractors. It all pointed to one thing, Anna Oop et al weren't just
2860460	2864380	a content farm, they were a bad content farm, and the only way they were able to keep their
2864380	2868960	feet on the ground in this genre was pretending to be a singular person, and simply outmaneuvering
2868960	2873140	all the actual people by rigging an algorithm in their favour by buying channels and strafe
2873140	2878060	running content, while holding hollow opinions that align with yours to keep them watching.
2878060	2883060	And the worst thing about it, is that it completely, 100% worked.
2892660	2896820	There's one more point I want to make regarding Butterface's apology, and that's a video
2896820	2898380	that was published alongside it.
2898380	2903540	Fans wanted to get to the bottom of things themselves, and even one fan tweeted Trinity
2903540	2907580	and asked her point blank if the account was hers, to which she responded,
2907580	2909780	Oh yes, I'm still on Reddit.
2909780	2916140	You might be thinking, ooh girl, that sounds like a confession. Well, it is, but it also
2916140	2917740	isn't, if that makes sense.
2917740	2921020	It's not exactly an objectionable video, but it's so strange seeing a channel that
2921020	2925420	is a self-admitted corporation trying to use jargon with intonations that it doesn't
2925420	2928780	feel like they can ever truly understand. Sure, they've dropped the guise that they're
2928780	2932540	a real person, they've said they understand why it's ethically questionable to do so,
2932540	2935580	but they're still trying to pull off that attitude that garnered them the attention
2935580	2938640	in the first place. With the knowledge that there are people behind the scenes pulling
2938640	2942780	the strings to make this video appealing to you, it just feels rather weird.
2942780	2946420	Audiences like to feel they're in control of the content they consume, and that's
2946420	2949420	why the difference between a rather generic corporate channel, and one that's trying
2949420	2953580	to yassify their view count comes into play. A middle ground corporate channel just wants
2953580	2957760	the view, the click, it's a transactional thing that both parties are aware of. These
2957760	2961820	channels though, they do something different, they commercialise the viewer's connection
2961820	2965400	with the community and the culture that comes with it, so they appropriate parts of it to
2965400	2969380	appeal to people. To be honest, it's not that I think it's inherently immoral to
2969380	2973400	do that, but I think it does make people uncomfortable, and I don't think people are often willing
2973400	2977460	to support a channel like that, which is probably why the guise of an individual person is always
2977460	2982320	going to be more effective, even if you gave a corporation personality. Unfortunately,
2982320	2985680	it's just not believable that there are a bunch of guys in suits who are genuinely
2985680	2990240	shook over whatever's being said between online influencers. Companies just don't
2990240	2994840	have the merit to appear legitimately interested in certain circles of culture, but it can't
2994840	2996320	stop them from trying.
2996320	3000740	As a corporate channel, Anna Oop had very few defining features, no exceptional research,
3000740	3005240	no great wisdom to impart, but as a person, their personality perfectly fit into a community
3005240	3009920	that welcomed the characteristically audacious creator who just says what she feels and doesn't
3009920	3012680	have a damn who tries to stop her tea-spilling endeavours.
3012680	3017200	Anna Oop We all sat through hours and hours of cringe
3017200	3023320	music this year, and I think we all understood that influencers should not make music. Unless
3023320	3026160	you're the hypocritical b**** that is me, of course.
3026160	3028260	TRO Say what you want about Spill, I think many
3028260	3031840	gave them their fair share of criticism back in the day, but they weren't necessarily
3031840	3035880	bad at what they were doing. The least I can say about them is that in the general discourse
3035880	3039640	of corporate-based channels, they did a decent job at keeping their audience informed and
3039680	3043360	maintained. They presented content in a way that many channels simply could not, and those
3043360	3047800	are two of the key tenets of any YouTube channel that I mentioned in the introduction.
3047800	3052060	Anna Oop, on the other hand, was just mass-produced junk food content. I think that's what bothers
3052060	3056200	me the most about their channel as a concept. Corporations do have the ability to do what
3056200	3060000	many individual creators cannot, and they can achieve great feats with their resources
3060000	3064080	and manpower. Have the team behind Anna Oop settled on purposely being less than that
3064080	3068160	because they wanted the illusion of humanity? All these opinions about who was in the right
3068160	3073120	or wrong in their content, possibly fabricated to play to a crowd. It's risky business
3073120	3077920	doing that, and easily leads to contradictions that could harm people involved or mentioned.
3077920	3082480	The truth is that everything is an algorithm to some extent, even personal values and expressions
3082480	3087000	of those that can supposedly organically draw an audience in. It's an inevitability, and
3087000	3090240	plenty of creators have been called out in their time for expressing opinions they may
3090240	3094320	not truly hold. Playing to the crowd is common. However, when you engineer channels with the
3094320	3097640	sole intent to play into the crowd, not only do you reduce the realm of critical thought
3097680	3102000	in that genre, you also may make a lot of damn additional mistakes. The majority opinion
3102000	3106200	isn't always the right one. Making errors is part of life as an individual creator,
3106200	3110240	we're only human and we strive to grow. At the same time, I think most creators' lives
3110240	3113360	would be easier if we didn't make those errors and didn't have to deal with the
3113360	3116920	guilt and shame that comes with them. To have a corporate network, the creative formula
3116920	3120800	to enable those errors is just insulting to the people who spend hours trying to avoid
3120800	3125700	such pitfalls. It also amplifies harm that can be spread through falsehoods and misrepresentations
3125700	3129780	that may not have spread otherwise. This was especially valid with the true crime genre,
3129780	3134600	a section of YouTube that demands meticulousness and dignity for all those involved. The incompetence
3134600	3138700	of Anna Sols could not have just prospectively damaged other creators in the domain, but
3138700	3143140	also victims and their families as well who are often the subject of these stories. That's
3143140	3146820	why a personal connection to the content is often important, because that connection will
3146820	3150420	provide you with an inherent motive to be sensitive to the world around you, otherwise
3150420	3154300	the only real motive that exists is the one the numbers, and sometimes the numbers will
3154300	3157940	tell you to do something different to the people. Sure, the best way to attract clicks
3157940	3162180	is to exaggerate titles and thumbnails, while dramatising the story and asking viewers what
3162180	3166380	do you think about this mass murderer, but not all content should be treated that way.
3166380	3170100	When Anna Oop moved from the T to true crime, there wasn't any real acknowledgement of
3170100	3174260	the sheer differences between the two realms. Too many businesses don't distinguish that
3174260	3178160	one genre may have different rules to another, because they lack that personal connection
3178160	3183140	to understand the nuances, which is what caused so much unrest in the true crime community.
3183140	3187660	People felt that Anna didn't respect those cases, and they may well have been correct.
3187660	3191300	The other problem with seeing matters only through numbers is how you interpret the absence
3191300	3195300	of others, and how you interact with criticism. The Truth Through Reality situation showed
3195300	3199280	us that, separate to the point of copyright altogether, the Anna Solves community post
3199280	3203000	projected the intention of a channel like theirs onto a channel like Truth's, who
3203000	3206860	for all intents and purposes doesn't actually sincerely care about the stories he covers.
3206860	3210500	It's particularly illuminating the comparison of the response to someone like Truth, a smaller
3210500	3215000	creator, and Mr Balan, a larger creator. One video is taken down swiftly and silently,
3215000	3219120	the other resulted in a public campaign that only stalled when people called them out for
3219120	3222500	it. And alright, maybe they would have been able to pass as a person with less outrage
3222500	3226760	if they'd merely created content and avoided any outside interactions, but they used this
3226760	3231120	perception as a human to instigate drama with other creators and elicit sympathy from their
3231120	3235300	viewers. It gave them the ability to use those human emotions to leverage favourable outcomes
3235300	3239100	and just attention in general. How that sort of attention could only yield so much good
3239100	3243100	when your own shortcomings become more noticeable, and the channels around you begin to falter
3243100	3247460	as well. Even businesses stretch themselves thin trying to cut corners, and the same numbers
3247460	3250780	that tell you the more content the better make you forget about the other numbers that
3250780	3254820	gave you those numbers in the first place. In the end, even without an admission, people
3254820	3273420	felt the mask had slipped, an inhuman schedule with an inhumane approach. All was undone.
3273420	3276980	Nothing was real.
3276980	3286500	I suppose behind the scenes there are many ways that the AnnoOops squad could have responded
3286500	3290380	with which we would not necessarily be aware of. They could have found a person with a
3290380	3293660	bit more experience in the community, and given them greater reins over the research
3293660	3297500	and production. They could have centralised the channel's presence more on an individual,
3297500	3301100	given them control of operations, or at least helped them oversee the work being done on
3301100	3304900	their behalf. They're never gonna be as organic as some, but for all we know these
3304900	3308580	are steps that could have been taken since being called out, which is why I don't want
3308580	3312740	to presently malign them too much when not entitled to know exactly everything someone
3312740	3317540	is doing to improve themselves. However, it's hard to say that outside of that, any individual
3317540	3320980	passion has been developed for the content they're creating, although avoiding any
3320980	3324700	large scale controversies have still occasionally been called out and criticised for a lack
3324700	3328700	of originality in their content. A recent video, in particular from a YouTuber by the
3328700	3332800	name of The Asher Show, alleges that they have copied his topics multiple times, without
3332800	3334640	providing any credits.
3362800	3372600	Two months ago, November 5th, I made this video the history of the most hated person
3372600	3380060	on TikTok. It did quite well, 889,000 views, but here three weeks ago, January 6th, the
3380060	3384860	childish TikToker who got cancelled for being annoying. It's getting a little too coincidental
3384860	3390620	at this point. November 26th, 2022, I posted this. Anna Oop posted this January 9th, 2023.
3390620	3394480	And the weirdest part about this, nothing in the description, no references here, but
3394480	3398700	everyone just take a listen, and who is speaking at the beginning of this video?
3398700	3404420	Baguette! Baguette sauce! Meatballs!
3404420	3407460	Hate people that waste food, why do you have to waste food on TikTok?
3407460	3411700	No thanks! Come on! Just a little bit.
3411700	3416140	It's like, the more food you waste, the more views it gets. Why?
3416140	3417140	Idiot!
3417140	3422660	It's not funny, you're just being completely wasteful. Am I on the Anna Oop payroll now?
3422660	3424340	Now I'm voicing your channel?
3424340	3428180	There are a few examples here that I think fall into a grey area, and I'm not sure
3428180	3432420	they point to the degree of plagiarism previously covered, but together they definitely do paint
3432420	3436660	a picture. I don't think this is exactly content theft, but it does kind of represent
3436660	3440900	what Anna Oop is without the pretense that they're a real person, just a hollow machine
3440900	3445300	that can't produce original thoughts or ideas for themselves. Another notable example
3445300	3448580	of this was Anna Oop's video on Technoblade shortly after his death.
3448580	3453780	Hello everyone, Technoblade here. If you're watching this, I'm dead.
3453780	3457340	Given that Anna hadn't really shown much investment in the Minecraft community, this
3457340	3460980	video just seemed really out of place for the channel, and the video itself just felt
3460980	3464940	like they were regurgitating information they read elsewhere, and adding a delicate piano
3464940	3468820	to provide it with an illusion of poignancy, with a lot of people calling it out in the
3468820	3469820	comments.
3469820	3474140	Alex had rarely shown himself on his YouTube videos, as he made it clear to his fans that
3474140	3479940	he prefers to present himself as an avatar instead, and guys, his own fans even recognised
3479940	3483060	Technoblade as his real name throughout the years on YouTube.
3483060	3486900	However, even with content that you'd expect Anna to be a bit more familiar with, you see
3486900	3490900	a lot of comments deriding Anna Oop for their rather obnoxious clickbait, luring people
3490900	3494620	in with borderline false statements. I'd probably have more to say if the topics didn't
3494620	3498540	bore me so much, but it is absolutely amazing what some people can turn into an 8 minute
3498540	3502460	video today, but then again it's amazing what some people can turn into a 4 hour video
3502460	3503460	too.
3503460	3510540	Do y'all love the sound of peace and quiet? Do you wake up in the morning feeling content?
3510540	3515900	No? Yeah. Me neither. Y'all.
3515900	3519700	To me it doesn't feel like anything's changed at all, and it's hard to change sometimes
3519700	3523020	when you have a formula that's working, and outside of a certain sect of people in
3523020	3527260	the T community, the greater YouTube audience don't tend to watch such content, and majority
3527260	3530620	people don't care for the drama, they don't read the comments, they don't watch the
3530620	3534140	videos, they simply don't care, and who can blame them, there are only so many hours
3534140	3537940	in the day to spend indulging in drama content, and those viewers are probably more interested
3537940	3541980	in Selena Gomez than they are the person talking about them. The only person to blame really
3541980	3546140	is Anna, and well they're not really a person, they're part of a company doing what they
3546140	3550060	know best, they say and they do what is best for themselves, they don't relate to that
3550060	3553740	moral obligation that other creators may do, because from their point of view, what does
3553740	3557060	it matter whether they are who they say they are if they can deliver content that people
3557060	3560860	want to watch? Being an influencer on any platform is profitable, they're celebrities
3560860	3564180	of their own kind who don't have to provide every single detail of their existence if
3564180	3567820	they don't want to, they don't have to show their face, they don't even have to talk,
3567820	3571580	it's the perfect combination for someone looking to make a few bucks, you can create
3571580	3575460	celebrities without proving they're even real. The problem is that when you do that,
3575460	3579180	you force out individuals who actually are who they say they are. That's why Anna Oop
3579180	3583020	really was the worst kind of business venture, in their head what they were doing was merely
3583020	3586860	trying to fit in, succeeding in an area where there wasn't massive competition by corporate
3586860	3590700	channels, but really what they did was take over a market whose sole existence was based
3590700	3594380	on individuality, and directly competing with creators who could never dream of keeping
3594380	3598500	up with such a production line. It's like asking IBM to create a computer for your amateur
3598500	3602980	chess tournament, sure the computer is gonna win, but what was the point anyway? They have
3602980	3606540	their own realms where they can compete, domains where they can succeed and flourish, and generally
3606540	3610000	facilitate the creation of technology that a single person may struggle with. Although
3610000	3614920	owning all the casual chess players is something they can do, is it something they should do?
3614920	3618840	Beyond the conceptual problem of having companies in control of public opinion, it's bad for
3618840	3622720	other creators as well, we constantly have the discussion on YouTube regarding creator
3622720	3626780	burnout, the fragility of mental health, but a creator's first priority will nearly always
3626780	3630680	be to keep their channel alive, and if they're competing with people who have infinitely
3630680	3634880	more resources to do that then they will struggle, their channel will either fall to the wayside
3634880	3638520	because they know they can't keep up, or the creator will run out of fuel trying to
3638520	3642320	do so. There's no winning option for the individual here other than to attempt to be
3642320	3646000	a better content farm, and we've already seen the distinct problems with that which
3646000	3650120	can really harm a community. If content is watered down to meet people's expectations
3650120	3653720	then the quality of discourse suffers too, then the only option left for people craving
3653720	3658520	a higher standard of information is for better content farms like Spill. This may well happen,
3658520	3663400	and if audiences choose it then so be it, maybe people enjoy content farms, but I'd
3663400	3667080	like to advocate for the power of the individual creators, the ones who are gonna talk about
3667080	3670660	these subjects because they care about them. Over time plenty more Anna oops are gonna
3670660	3674060	pop up, and they're gonna masquerade as people because it's their market that can
3674060	3678040	be tapped. The power of social bond that can be formed is priceless for them, but it's
3678040	3682200	always a one way relationship for a business like theirs. Many of these channels will completely
3682200	3686080	lack a personal connection to their content, and the community that has instilled a social
3686080	3689980	status on them, which is why it was so easy for a channel like Anna's to lie about their
3689980	3694240	identity in the first place. That's why individuals matter more in these spaces, because
3694240	3698320	there's an expectation to care, an expectation to listen. There's nothing right now I could
3698320	3702920	say to this company, but there's always something you can say to a person. Anna Oop is the sort
3702920	3706000	of channel that I just don't really enjoy, and I honestly wouldn't have too much to
3706000	3710600	say outside of that if Anna was a real content creator, a biased YouTuber who plays with
3710600	3714760	the crowd and is careless with details they should be more diligent with. What's new?
3714760	3718600	But the truth is Anna Oop was more than that, they were a channel that built themselves
3718600	3723280	on a fundamental lie, utilised all the advantages of a well invested company with pre-purchase
3723320	3727220	channels and conveyor belt content, while utilising audience sympathy by complaining
3727220	3731080	to others about how oppressed they were as an individual creator. They really had their
3731080	3735720	fingers in all the pies. Following these successes, the Anna Oop team had the choice to be better
3735720	3740240	as channels as they branched out into more sensitive subjects, and just chose not to
3740240	3744320	be, using their increased money to just pump out more content rather than improving what
3744320	3747920	they produced as a whole. I think the most sinister fact about the plagiarism case was
3747920	3752160	that Anna Oop took advantage of that humanity, that belief in their identity, and warped
3752160	3757120	into a way to attack a creator who had no motive to maliciously take their content down.
3757120	3760000	Anna Oop has removed countless videos from their channel before, it would have been a
3760000	3764020	drop in the corporate ocean, and yet they went down swinging. When the whole network
3764020	3767900	was called out, they just scaled down the project a little, still passing their content
3767900	3772640	off from a first person perspective with tons of tea spilling opinions to this day. It's
3772640	3777560	all a crock of shit, a big crock of shit, and part of me expects I should be more bothered,
3777560	3781200	but in the end this just feels inevitable, there's only so many arguments I could make
3781240	3785540	surrounding their existence, and all I'd finish on is why would we need companies pretending
3785540	3792560	to be YouTubers when we already have YouTubers? What does Anna Oop really offer? Businesses
3792560	3797900	on YouTube, for better and for worse they're here to stay, and in many cases I try not
3797900	3802300	to view their presence as a wholly negative feature, but they can be, especially when
3802300	3805920	all they offer is a highly processed form of content that is propped up by communities
3805920	3810280	they'll never truly understand. Anna Oop is an example of that, and one can only hope
3810360	3815640	their formula isn't one that is duplicated too often. However, if they are here to stay,
3815640	3821640	I hope they remember there are some things you can't, and shouldn't, invent. Thank you.
3840280	3847280	average of one to two videos per day so it's quite literally physically impossible that
3847800	3853320	Anna Oop doesn't have any help with at least to prove to you guys without a shadow of a
3853320	3859180	doubt that Anna Oop, one of the biggest T channels, one of the biggest drama content
3859180	3866180	creators here on the platform is a part of a massive content farm. Anna Oop!
3870280	3876640	Ok guys, that was the video, I hope you all enjoyed it, thank you if you made it this
3876640	3881480	far. I'd first like to give a big shout out to the editors, once again their names will
3881480	3885480	be on the screen, and in the pinned comment they do a great job, if you wanna check out
3885480	3889600	more of their work it'll be down there below to have a look at. I wanna give a big thanks
3889600	3895160	to my patrons, $10 patrons on the screen right now, thank you so much for your contribution
3895160	3903920	guys, and also my $50 patrons, Laura Woodward, Sari Tish, Esther Bedoya, and Hypercube. Thank
3903920	3908000	you so much, these guys have been around for a pretty decent amount of time now so I really
3908000	3912260	do appreciate it. What else do I need to thank? I feel like I'm missing something. Big thanks
3912260	3918760	to Thumbnail by Starpo, big thanks to the artists who do wonderful art, great in the
3918760	3923880	video, if your art is featured in this video and you're looking for credit then just let
3923880	3929000	me know. Merch, as I said we're still doing merch, I really like the mugs we do, if you
3929000	3935000	wanna check them out, once again, link will be in the pinned comment, and it's getting
3935000	3940080	a bit hot up here so I'll probably wrap it up quickly, but hope you enjoyed the video,
3940080	3943160	and I'm The Right Opinion, and I'll see you in the next one.
3953880	3963880	Thank you so much for watching, and I'll see you in the next one.
