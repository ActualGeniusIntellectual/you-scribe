00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,860
Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too

2
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:17,660
much free time, and businesses on YouTube. Whether we like it or not, they're here

3
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:22,340
to stay, and in many cases, I try not to view their presence as a wholly negative one. It's

4
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:26,560
important to remember that one of our primary purposes as creators is to bring entertainment

5
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,300
to those who use the platform, and if a channel can do that, whoever it's run by, then we

6
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,580
can broadly agree that it's a net positive for audiences. Businesses will always occupy

7
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:39,020
a realm of YouTube, and I do believe there can be a peaceful coexistence. At the same

8
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:42,980
time, there will always be tension. To be honest, it's understandable why more grassroots

9
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:47,140
creators feel unnerved by their presence. Businesses have so much more power and resources

10
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:51,240
at their fingertips to outflank independent YouTubers in many aspects of quality control.

11
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,900
They can create high production pieces in a few days that would take an individual upwards

12
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:58,600
of a month, bombing the algorithm with a myriad of content that often gives what many

13
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:03,120
would perceive an unfair advantage to them against the humble creator. When market domination

14
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,120
comes from a few large corporations, the outcome for the consumer is generally not particularly

15
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:10,920
positive. It leads to less diversity in general, and more control of narratives by a select

16
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,560
few people, and in industries that are already prone enough to corruption, it's anything

17
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,380
but healthy. YouTube was built on the notion of allowing a person to broadcast themselves

18
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:21,840
without the necessary investment of a larger business so they didn't have to dance to

19
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,260
anyone's tunes, and many people would like to keep it that way. Fortunately, there will

20
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:29,060
always be people who will occupy these spaces regardless of their market success, but at

21
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:33,220
the same time, it's still good to have individual figures in influential positions who can represent

22
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:37,100
a human aspect to content creation, and although businesses have certainly made more inroads

23
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:40,140
on the platform than they used to, there will always be that window of authenticity that

24
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:44,620
seems to separate many of them from the personally driven passion projects. The truth is, one

25
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:49,340
thing that is hard to fabricate is that individual enthusiasm one has for a subject they cover,

26
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:53,480
and although not impossible, many large businesses simply don't see it as a required component

27
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:58,760
for success, and as channels like Looper, Minit Crafts, whatever they're called, and

28
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:03,080
the rest have shown, you really don't need that much framework on personality to succeed.

29
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:06,860
In fact, avoiding building any personal image ensures that they keep any components that

30
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:11,120
may change disposable, and that ultimately, control of the content is still centralised

31
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,960
on the people who run the channel, and not those they may outsource a variety of the

32
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:18,480
work to. This formula means that there is a boundary before more independent content

33
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,620
and more detached corporate presentations, however, just because there's a rule doesn't

34
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:27,360
mean that there aren't exceptions, particularly in the community we're focusing on today.

35
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,480
Commentary is genre that large corporations tend to avoid infiltrating, particularly given

36
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:35,880
the aforementioned paragraph. Having a personality is almost essential to the content you're

37
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:39,780
producing, even if you're merely presenting information, viewers expect at least a little

38
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:43,620
pizzazz. Audience members want to build a relationship based on trust with the person

39
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:46,680
they're listening to, how can you do that when you don't even know if there's a real

40
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:50,080
person behind the channel? However, this doesn't mean that there aren't some willing

41
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,720
to take the risk, and one subgenre of commentary knows this all too well, that being the Tea

42
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,720
community.

43
00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:01,880
A popular YouTube channel is about to hit 1 million subscribers, they showed up, out

44
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:06,760
of nowhere, almost a year ago, and the people want to know, who is Spill?

45
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:10,600
A few years ago, there was a drama in the community that surrounded a channel called

46
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:14,880
Spill. Spill is a channel that hosts numerous videos with high production value and an astonishing

47
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:19,400
upload schedule given those said videos. They also hosted a syndicate of channels alongside

48
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:24,360
Spill, including Brew, Grill, and On The Hill. I'll speak more about them in the future,

49
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:28,600
but a video they uploaded covering their origin at the time had made them seem more homegrown

50
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,760
than they actually were.

51
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,680
Spill started out as a two-person passion project, one of us has a background in journalism,

52
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:39,100
the other has a background in illustration and video editing. We both love YouTube news

53
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:43,720
and drama, who doesn't? We wanted to create a channel that had a more journalistic approach

54
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:49,200
to YouTube drama, a thorough recap of all sides of a story with proper citations. On

55
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,900
top of that, we wanted to give something back to the community by contributing to the conversation

56
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:58,360
with an educational approach. And while a lot of people choose to do creative projects

57
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:02,960
while being self-employed, as soon as more than one person is working on a big project

58
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:07,000
together, it's legally the best option to register as a corporation.

59
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,360
The reality was that Spill and their accompanying channels were part of a larger company that

60
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,040
had branched out into the tea community, and although people involved with the channel

61
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,480
were actually quite interested in the stories that they covered, they weren't exactly

62
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:22,600
how they portrayed themselves, and that gave some in the community reason for pause.

63
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:36,360
Spill- So my question to you is pretty simple, who are you going to believe? Spill saying

64
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:41,200
that the corporation was a reaction to their 2018 YouTube channel growing, or the Canadian

65
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,420
government saying that this corporation has been around since 2013.

66
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:47,440
The tea community appeared to be a target for companies and content farms who had been

67
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,200
looking for a way to capitalise on the evident draw of commentary channels. What makes tea

68
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:55,240
channels so attractive to businesses though? Well, I think it's because they often integrate

69
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:59,400
reporting a factual or speculative information in a rather straightforward manner. It's

70
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,920
not difficult to grasp, but in cases like Spill, all they had to do was attempt to cut

71
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:06,960
out bias from the reporters themselves. So although the channel felt like a tea channel,

72
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:11,960
it was more over a news channel covering tea topics with a nice presentation, and any

73
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:16,280
attempts to add personality such as their grill channel have not attracted that much

74
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:20,540
attention because of it. With that in mind, the Spill family hasn't taken up too much

75
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:24,480
space despite their impressive collective size, and other up and coming creators have

76
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:29,320
still been able to carve out a niche for themselves, one of those being the subject of today, a

77
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:42,640
channel by the name of Anna Oop. Anna Oop is a tea channel who has grown to be one of

78
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:46,080
the most influential creators in her sphere, with over 2 million subscribers on her main

79
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,240
channel and nearly 4 million subscribers when counting her other channels, focusing more

80
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,240
on true crime.

81
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:55,400
Did you guys ever see any of the TikTok videos about Isabella? What did you think when you

82
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:59,240
saw them? I can't wait to read your thoughts and discussions down in the comments below.

83
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:03,480
Her all-American girl charm and sassy nature is well complemented by editing with real

84
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:07,300
personality behind it, resulting in content that appears to have captured the hearts of

85
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:11,400
many viewers, with her true crime content garnering popularity for being a bite-sized

86
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:15,960
accessible breakdown of often very complex cases. All in all, she seems to be the prime

87
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:19,960
example of individual success in the face of a climate that is becoming more and more

88
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:24,420
demanding of creators, with thousands tuning into her channels every day to hear that voice

89
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:28,140
and the person behind it. But what's there more to this humble 21 year old than meets

90
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:31,900
the eye? Well, today we're going to be doing some investigating of our own, following Anna

91
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:35,820
Oop's timeline, and seeing whether this success story was really as organic as it

92
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:41,020
seemed. Ladies, gentlemen, and all other colours on the light spectrum, let's look into the

93
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:55,780
mystery of inventing Anna Oop.

94
00:06:55,780 --> 00:07:00,500
The YouTube channel for Anna Oop was created in May 2019, it's hard to re-say too much

95
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:04,180
about them at this point as many of their videos from back then were deleted, and I

96
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:07,980
do want to save a bit of information for later, but I think from the off Anna knew what sort

97
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:11,780
of creator she wanted to be, particularly with a name like that, which refers to a popular

98
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:21,180
meme that regularly circulates around the beauty and other communities.

99
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:24,660
The video started off quite modestly, with a star that was similar to many other tea

100
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:28,540
channels at the time, content that delivered information in a mostly verbally free text

101
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:32,540
format over copyright free soundtracks, being interspersed with the relevant clips of the

102
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:36,340
discourse. The topics she chose were also those which were long established to have

103
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:40,540
proven dividends for creators, these subjects mostly included large influences and even

104
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:45,500
celebrities such as Ariana Grande or Bretman Rock. Not all of these videos were necessarily

105
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:49,560
unbiased or journalistic, some of them were heavily opinionated, such as her videos on

106
00:07:49,560 --> 00:08:03,020
Nikita Dragun.

107
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:06,540
These are all important aspects to building an individual's relationship with an audience,

108
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:09,940
whether it be positive or negative. There are people who like Nikita Dragun, there are

109
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:13,620
people who do not like Nikita Dragun, but having people who care is already half the

110
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:17,460
battle to engage with them with your videos. Such content drives up engagement and encourages

111
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:21,720
people to like, dislike, and leave their comments. However, if you're only known to be a dedicated

112
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:25,140
hater, then you're not really going to build much potential with your viewers, your takes

113
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:29,440
still need to be somewhat reasonable and elaborated from their point of view, and Anna Oop did

114
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,600
that for many people. Her strong skills in production, conveying digestible if lightweight

115
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:38,280
information garnered her an audience very quickly, and when I say very quickly, I mean

116
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,920
nearly immediately.

117
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:44,720
By the time December 2019 came around, Anna was already approaching 50,000 subscribers,

118
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,120
something that few creators could really dream of in the first eight months of their content

119
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:51,680
creation. But subscribers weren't the only thing she was building, most importantly,

120
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,080
she was building a rapport with those who viewed her, and she knew the importance of

121
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:58,480
this. She'd regularly advertise her Twitter and Instagram so she could prevent fanart

122
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:02,120
of herself, and was seemingly an active member of the community at this time, talking with

123
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:05,880
audience members and fellow creators. She had a few gimmicks as well, the most interesting

124
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:09,820
one was calling her viewers, and people she interacted with love, and intentional misspelling

125
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:14,320
of a word that could mean a term of endearment in certain places. They were building a persona

126
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:19,000
with identifiable yet unique characteristics, and people were tuning in for them, yet there

127
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,960
was more work to be done.

128
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:24,760
Heading into the new year of 2020, Anna seemed determined to take her channel to the next

129
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:29,040
level, and in January, she switched from the commonly used text format to using her own

130
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,360
voice. Normally, you'd think there would be more of an announcement, or at least some

131
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:36,660
build up to such a change in format, you'd think there could be some attention in a voice

132
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:40,880
reveal at least, but it seems that Anna didn't want to make a scene, and I can't blame

133
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:45,560
her for that. The first documented video to use her voice is the upload on Nikki's tutorials,

134
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:49,160
and given the subject, Anna's sombre tone appears to be appropriate.

135
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:53,640
Of course, many people are all pretty mad about this, and want to know who did this

136
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:58,740
to Nikki. There's been a lot of speculations, and some people are even accusing famous YouTubers,

137
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:02,560
and some of Nikki's closest friends. There were even rumours that one of the blackmailers

138
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:07,520
was the company Too Faced, who had previously manipulated Nikki into going into a deal with

139
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,240
them where she lost millions.

140
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:13,740
Although at first Anna Oop's delivery on subjects appears quite subdued, with each

141
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:18,060
passing month she seemed to find more and more zest when covering these topics, gradually

142
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:22,220
transforming into the more bold and brash character people are familiar with today.

143
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:26,060
However, it wasn't just what was being said on YouTube that was important to Anna, and

144
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:29,900
throughout the year she said about many ways that would familiarise the viewers with her

145
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:30,900
as a person.

146
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:35,900
Hi loves, your girl is back again. So today we're going to talk about Tana Mongeau's

147
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:41,260
infamous reality TV show on MTV, and y'all, this show really ain't it.

148
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:46,100
In Spring 2020, Anna's existing Twitter account was deleted, seemingly suspended, and a number

149
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:49,260
of videos were purged from her channel. The reason being somewhat unknown, as many of

150
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:53,420
these videos weren't exactly poorly performing, but it seemed to work, as the summer of 2020

151
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:56,700
found Anna increasing her view and subscriber count at breakneck pace.

152
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:01,280
However, she wasn't without her challenges. In May 2020, Anna's channel was demonetised

153
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:05,840
by YouTube, who cited unoriginal content being the reason Anna took to Twitter to dispute

154
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:09,620
this, highlighting the amount of work that she puts into her channel. Given the amount

155
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:13,660
of second-hand material used by T channels, this isn't a rare occurrence, as YouTube

156
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:17,680
often struggles to distinguish the two. Anna also used her platform to stick up for another

157
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,460
creator who found themselves in a similar situation. She also found the time to be outspoken

158
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:27,060
in support for social causes such as BLM, the Lebanon crisis, and LGBT rights, characterising

159
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:31,380
them as causes that meant a lot to her. She'd post memes, provide opinions, celebrate her

160
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:35,900
birthday which was on the 12th of July, and even hosted a Twitter Q&A, all of which enabled

161
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:39,480
her to build a closer relationship with her viewers. Some of her answers were a little

162
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:43,500
non-descript, but you can't expect a creator to be comfortable with giving all their personal

163
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:47,860
details out to the public. With that said, her favourite film series is The Hunger Games,

164
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:52,260
her favourite animal is a koala bear, and her favourite game is Roblox. They weren't

165
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:56,780
surprising details, but they were meaningful to those who supported her, and her personality

166
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:58,460
only became more iconic.

167
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:03,840
Anna Oop In the space of barely a year and a half, Anna

168
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:08,420
Oop had transformed the landscape of the T community into one suitable for her. Her strong

169
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:12,420
production value and excellent upload schedule paired with an identifiable character major

170
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:16,020
a force to be reckoned with, and Anna knew the importance of retaining people who cared

171
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:20,620
about her. She wanted people to get to know her for who she was, and she wanted people

172
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:25,100
to know her appreciation for them, even occasionally tweeting out love and gratitude to those who

173
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:29,460
helped her find success in an often challenging industry. However, Anna was number one to

174
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:33,620
rest on her laurels. In fact, her success had only made her more ambitious, and on the

175
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:37,060
3rd of December, she tweeted out that she was working on a new channel that she thought

176
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:39,320
her viewers were going to love.

177
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:44,120
What was Anna Oop cooking? Well, we're about to find out.

178
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:48,380
Anna Oop Not every case is the same, and plenty of

179
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:52,280
unsolved cases still desperately need to be solved.

180
00:12:52,280 --> 00:13:00,560
True Crime It's really hard to think of a more significant

181
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:04,440
development to the YouTube community in the last few years than that of the true crime

182
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:08,840
genre. Now, true crime has always possessed a presence in mainstream media, it long pre-existed

183
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,720
YouTube, and will probably long outlast it. However, the storytelling aspect appears to

184
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,700
have taken its grasp in the last few years, with many creators garnering millions of subscribers

185
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:20,400
for their coverage of criminal cases, solved and unsolved. There's always been a bit

186
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:24,120
of stigma around the inclusion of such topics, particularly given the fact that it's being

187
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:28,560
published to potentially millions of people, and some would rather have it out of the spotlight.

188
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,640
Nonetheless, the consensus seems to be that if these topics are treated with the due amount

189
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:36,280
of respect, then there is a place for them. Interestingly, there seems to be a decent

190
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:40,400
overlap between tea and beauty communities, and true crime, with some true crime creators

191
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:44,400
having beauty roots, with some still integrating it into their videos, and it seems that Anna

192
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:48,560
pertained that same penchant for the morbid. It was clear that by the end of December,

193
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:59,240
her new channel was going to be true crime related. The first video was uploaded on the

194
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:03,240
5th of January, it followed the story of a TikToker who had slain his neighbours for

195
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:08,400
It was a suitably macabre topic, though Anna's voice does take a bit of getting used to in

196
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:12,480
this context. Honestly, she sounded more bad when she was talking about Nicky tutorials.

197
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,280
According to Zach's public defence lawyers, the video shows her telling the neighbours

198
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:19,700
to get off their property. She told them that they'd better back up, because they were

199
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:23,800
not going to like what's coming out of the house. Sounds like a threat, right?

200
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:27,160
Nonetheless, the video was well received, and accumulates a strong view count, with

201
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:32,080
the channel approaching 100,000 subscribers in the space of a few days, a surprising statistic

202
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:36,080
all things considered, but it must have reflected the strong cult of personality that someone

203
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:40,280
like Anna Oop had built, and in the next months, she continued to upload consistently on the

204
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:43,840
Anna Solve channel. Pretty impressive considering that she still had her main channel to run

205
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:48,000
as well, and in spite of what may have appeared as time constraints, she also managed to maintain

206
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,200
an upload schedule on there as well. Fortunately, most of these videos were limited to approximately

207
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:56,200
10 minutes at most, which likely allowed her to divide her time fairly evenly between the

208
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,360
two projects. However, although she was still experiencing growth on her main channel, the

209
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,960
true crime one appeared to be experiencing the greatest proportional success, accruing

210
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:07,720
over 300,000 subscribers by the time April came around. Now, such impressive statistics,

211
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:10,840
you might expect one to consolidate their achievements, and focus on how to make sure

212
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:14,900
that such levels of commitment can be preserved, but Anna had different ideas, and on June

213
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:19,140
of the same year, launched another channel, this one called Anna Horror Stories, which

214
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:24,080
as the name implies, comprises of Anna recounting the rather unnerving tales of others, that

215
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:27,200
recently has pivoted towards more list-style content.

216
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:31,360
Nonetheless, another channel, I mean, I respect the commitment to the grind, but it seems

217
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,520
like a lot to keep at, though, to be fair, this channel's content didn't seem the highest

218
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:39,600
effort either. The writing is someone else's, and the footage is pretty standard, Anna may

219
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,600
have just been looking to make a pretty penny. However, barely a couple weeks after the first

220
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:48,120
upload on this channel, Anna was back on Twitter again, polling people for her next channel,

221
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:51,260
asking what a good name would be, and quote tweeting another person saying that this would

222
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:55,280
be looking more into the psychological side of criminal behaviour. On the surface, it's

223
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:59,580
not unfeasible, but it's certainly surprising given Anna has no apparent background in criminal

224
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:03,800
psychology, she already has a true crime channel, and more than enough on her plate to worry

225
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:07,840
about. It seemed like a lot to be planning ahead for, when she barely had any opportunity

226
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:11,680
to gauge the amount of time she'd be able to balance between her already active three

227
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:16,320
channels and an additional fourth one, but maybe she really was just that inspired.

228
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,200
However, this idea appeared to stagnate a little, and developments over the coming months

229
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:23,740
stalled, with a tweet at the start of September explaining that her lack of activity on social

230
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:27,500
media was due to some personal stuff she'd been going through, and with all things considered

231
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:32,000
this was understandable. Her status as a large influencer had landed her in some drama, probably

232
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,140
the most notable example of this was her feud with that vegan teacher, a controversial figure

233
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:40,560
whose promotion of veganism has been overshadowed by her altercations with other online figures,

234
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,300
and accompanying contentious remarks.

235
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:53,440
Anna's responses weren't the most intellectual, sometimes merely consisting to the genius

236
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:57,880
content of eating a burger, but that vegan teacher was an easy target, and it allowed

237
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:20,120
Anna to repeatedly dunk on a person who'd already been widely lampooned by the internet.

238
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:24,240
If I found this drama interesting, I'd probably say more, but it at least established a more

239
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,640
queen side to Anna Oop, and persisted for the rest of the year. Although drama isn't

240
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,440
known to be the most fun to be involved in, Anna seemed to capitalise on the opportunity

241
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:36,200
to make sassy comments about all those who were hating on her, all while continuing to

242
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:40,640
upload consistently on her channels, and initiating work on other projects, including launching

243
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,960
a Roblox channel which would allow audiences to game with her. Additionally, she finally

244
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,480
launched the Anna Uncovered channel, the first video being uploaded at the end of November

245
00:17:48,480 --> 00:18:04,520
with a runtime of 18 minutes.

246
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:09,720
However, the zenith of her online career appeared to be approaching in December of 2021.

247
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:13,760
There had long been questions about the person behind Anna Oop's channel, and a face reveal

248
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:18,800
had long been sought after by the most dedicated viewers of her channel. Anna teased this before,

249
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:23,520
but with her hitting 2 million subscribers, it felt like a celebration was in order. Anna

250
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:28,000
continued to drop a variety of hints and clues to all that would be revealed, seemingly with

251
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,040
a song titled Face Reveal, which really could only imply one thing, especially given the

252
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:37,240
teaser trailers that were posted by Anna herself. Finally, people would have a face to put to

253
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:41,600
this commentator, and viewers were excited, but on the 3rd of December, the video for

254
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:58,640
Face Reveal was uploaded, and people were in shock.

255
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:28,240
What the fuck was that?

256
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,380
Anna Oop's Face Reveal contains a series of call-outs to other creators who she has

257
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:35,280
previously clashed with and spoken about, but the only person really being the subject

258
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:39,840
of any criticism during this video was her. Face Reveal was broadly ridicule for its sub-par

259
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:44,020
production quality and delivery, but also for the simple fact that it did not contain

260
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:48,360
a face reveal. In the video itself, Anna says she wishes she could, but clearly felt that

261
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:52,200
it was not the appropriate time, and later expands on this on Twitter, saying that she

262
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:56,280
was going to, but afraid that she would have to deal with too much negativity. I don't

263
00:19:56,280 --> 00:20:00,540
understand, I suppose, but why would you make a video titled Face Reveal in the first

264
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:05,240
place then, if the whole point of it was not to reveal your face? Well, Anna said she thought

265
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:08,880
it was just gonna be a fun little goof. It's hard to buy that someone as algorithmically

266
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:13,720
adept as Anna would not know the implications of advertising a face reveal on an otherwise

267
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:17,740
faceless channel, but maybe this stress from other drama had just impacted her judgement

268
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:21,880
a little, and yet, a few days before this, she had just launched another channel?

269
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:26,720
On top of this y'all, Anna Hoop is also known for her problematic personality. She's been

270
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:31,720
in scandal after scandal, constantly getting into drama herself, I mean, I think it's

271
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:34,320
about time we see Anna actually do a video on herse-

272
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,320
Oh.

273
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:38,960
This was just too much for one person, and surely she was spreading herself incredibly

274
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:43,640
thin by doing so, and not too long after, this theory may well have been proven correct.

275
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:47,040
Now there had always been stigma around Anna's channel, but a lot of the criticisms up to

276
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:51,680
a point were quite subjective, her opinions were poorly formed, her attitude was annoying,

277
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:55,640
and her content was clickbaiting. They may have all held some validity, but that doesn't

278
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:59,360
tend to make a particularly eye-catching discussion to those outside of the sphere.

279
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,360
However, a couple weeks after face reveal, Anna put out an interesting post on her Twitter

280
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:07,040
and YouTube community tab, complaining that a person had copyright struck her without

281
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:11,240
justification or ownership of content that she had been uploading. She also singled out

282
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:14,920
the channel that had copyright struck her, a channel by the name of Truthful Reality,

283
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:18,640
another true crime creator who had covered some of these same stories before Anna. On

284
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:23,000
superficial inspection, one can't necessarily claim ownership of topics, and a strike on

285
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,920
a channel for doing so would be wholly unjustified. However, as Anna's tweet and YouTube community

286
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:32,100
post began to pick up traction, a growing backlash from viewers began to form, many

287
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:36,400
of whom stating that Truthful Reality had claimed footage that he personally owned and

288
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:41,480
published solely, and Anna had directly lifted this without any transformative value, not

289
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:46,000
quite the story that Anna had told. Viewers also did not appreciate the fact that Anna

290
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,420
linked his channel, and although not accompanied by any direct call to action, the risk of

291
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:54,600
harassment from an emotionally charged post like this was always present, with some even

292
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:58,360
claiming that Anna had purposefully ignored any chance to peacefully resolve this matter

293
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:03,160
privately, only now taking umbrage after actions were taken against her channel. I suppose

294
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:07,000
it's in the nature of some more irreverent people in the community to behave this way,

295
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,400
but this is Anna's soul, not Anna Oop, and many people who are part of these communities

296
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:16,460
think that respect is an inherent part of creating content in this genre, but that appeared

297
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,120
to be just the tip of the iceberg.

298
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:23,420
About a few days before all this, a post had gone up on Reddit entitled Anna Oop aka Anna

299
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:27,780
Solve's At It Again, which documented the alleged plagiarism from a YouTuber named Mr.

300
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:32,000
Ballum, a channel with millions of subscribers. It was clear that this video had been removed

301
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,280
very promptly from Anna's channel following call-outs from commenters, and any of its

302
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:39,560
presence had been long erased. Additionally, about a few days after the Anna Solve channel

303
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:43,200
went live, a couple of comments appeared on her Twitter requesting her to refrain from

304
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,720
stealing content. That was in January, and now we were in December. It seems that rumours

305
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:51,360
have been circulating regarding stolen content on this channel for a while, but it only seemed

306
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:55,640
to surface when Anna herself decided to publicly attack another creator for what they perceived

307
00:22:55,640 --> 00:23:00,440
as an unjust copyright strike. I can't really comment on the legality of the copyright strike,

308
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:04,720
as it can be a very grey area, but it definitely shone a light on what many perceived to be

309
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:09,200
extensively lazy reporting from a creator who was not actually putting time into these

310
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:13,640
cases that they deserved. Claims of plagiarism are not that common, particularly given that

311
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:17,440
the cases themselves can be sourced from a lot of places, so this occurring twice in

312
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:21,960
the span of a very short time was a red flag for some viewers. Some of the concerns appeared

313
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:25,800
to address the idea that Anna didn't pronounce the names of people involved correctly, and

314
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:29,560
regularly made errors in reporting information. This is all important in the narrative of

315
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:33,620
stolen content, as a person who lifts content may not be familiar with the subject enough

316
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:37,960
to possess this knowledge, and will therefore make errors in reporting the actual details,

317
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:41,080
copying content, without actually understanding the subtext.

318
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:46,480
Today, we're going to talk about Nikocado Avocado disrespecting Veronica Vang.

319
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:50,960
I had come across this a few times when researching a few of Anna Oop's main channel videos,

320
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,720
and tried not to pay too much mind to it, as I've made more than enough pronunciation

321
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,640
and semantic errors in my time, but there was still something strange about certain

322
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:03,240
mistakes that struck me off as somebody supposedly so involved in the beauty community. Like,

323
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:06,800
how could you spell Jacqueline that way when you've literally used the correct spelling

324
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:10,900
in the title? It just didn't make sense. I'd read rumours that the reason for this

325
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:15,040
was to drive up impressions by having people correct you in the comments, and although

326
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:18,880
it's impossible to confirm, it's certainly something to consider with channels this supposedly

327
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,880
deliberate, and particularly relevant with Anna's true crime channels, where such shortcomings

328
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,640
could be perceived as seriously disrespectful.

329
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:29,160
Given Anna Oop's upload schedule, it seems that her final choice was to drop the matter

330
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:34,160
entirely and just create more videos, which she did. In fact, approaching the end of 2022,

331
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:38,280
between her now five channels, she was uploading nearly every day. The tweet regarding truth

332
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:42,100
for reality was deleted, and no content that was subject to the copyright claims was ever

333
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:46,720
restored to her channel. However, this situation did place a mark over the genuinity of her

334
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:51,280
content, and made people wonder how much of her channel was original. After all, it wouldn't

335
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:55,360
be the first time that this was called into question. Anna Oop's videos were well produced,

336
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:59,200
they looked nice, they had eye-catching titles and thumbnails, and love her or hate her,

337
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:03,760
Anna had a personality that provoked a response from audiences. She had a lot going for her,

338
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:07,840
it wouldn't have taken that much to do just a bit more research to avoid errors and any

339
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:11,480
risk of lifting other people's content. Yet all that was being put on the line for

340
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:15,440
videos that Anna didn't need or have to create. It didn't make sense for a person

341
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:21,100
to behave this way, it didn't make sense for a person to behave this way. Anna's face

342
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:26,440
reveal may not have gone exactly as many would have expected it to, but by the end of 2021,

343
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:30,480
many felt they had a better view of Anna Oop's face than they ever did before, with some

344
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:35,840
wondering whether there even was a face in the first place. Well, it wasn't long before

345
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:42,320
alternative theories began emerging, alongside some pretty damning evidence.

346
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:46,800
Now the trail of breadcrumbs seem to point out to this channel, who we are going to lovingly

347
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:52,000
call Team Anna Hoopoo-Poo-Poo-Poo-Poo-Poo-Poo-Poo-Poo.

348
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:07,000
Now there are always theories floating around surrounding the identity of Anna Oop, not

349
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,620
necessarily people wishing to have all her personal details, who are asking the question

350
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:15,520
whether she really was a legitimate individual content creator. However, without real evidence

351
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:19,560
proving one way or the other, all you could do was speculate. There are plenty of alternative

352
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:24,240
explanations, perhaps Anna just outsources a large amount of her work and enjoys a feeling

353
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:28,920
of being super productive, it's not impossible. Outsourcing doesn't necessarily undermine

354
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:32,600
the individuality of a channel as long as they still have a personal connection to what

355
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:37,600
they do. Maybe Anna Oop just really likes money or algorithmic success, they may not

356
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:42,280
be the most noble reasons, but that also wouldn't change her personal identity or connection

357
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:46,680
to the channel. Anna had once claimed to have watched old videos critical of her, even showing

358
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:50,640
one which outwardly shows the thumbnail claiming her channel was a company, so she must have

359
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,160
been aware of these discussions.

360
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:57,020
Don't ask, I've already seen all the hate videos about me on YouTube, but let me remind

361
00:26:57,020 --> 00:27:00,860
you that my only job here is to entertain y'all, and that's why your girl decided

362
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:02,940
to launch my new channel, AnnaPlays.

363
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:07,340
However, the drama surrounding the copyright strike did ring a few alarm bells. A large

364
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:11,380
majority of creators still want to be proud of the work they attach their brand name to,

365
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:15,340
even if there are significant contributions from other parties, but Anna's posts seem

366
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:20,260
to convey a lack of understanding of how this copyright strike even came about. They say

367
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:25,040
it was for no reason at all. Even if you didn't edit the content yourself, the first thing

368
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:29,520
you'd do is try and establish exactly why this happened. Anna is obviously aware this

369
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:33,760
isn't just some random bloke or corporation trying to cash in on her content because she

370
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:38,520
links his channel. This is another true crime YouTuber who probably cares about his reputation

371
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:42,280
as well, so there was clearly some motive behind the strike, whether you think that

372
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:47,080
was justified or not, but Anna couldn't put two and two together, which is very strange

373
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,080
indeed.

374
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:51,480
They had been murmuring since then that there was more to this story, including an earlier

375
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:55,680
comment that alleged that Anna had ignored attempts to reconcile the matter in private,

376
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:59,240
but ultimately the story appeared to fizzle out. However, there were other developments

377
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:04,140
that were going on in the nearby drag race community that would throw the case wide open,

378
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,840
so let's go there now briefly.

379
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:11,840
Hey queens! Some people found this dig from Carmen to be a little out of line, because

380
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:17,780
Gottmik's appearance on the show was a big deal. Regardless of the fact that Mick identifies

381
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:21,940
as male, having a trans queen on the season was huge.

382
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:26,280
This is Butterface, they're a channel that operates in the drag race community that follows

383
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:32,020
the famous RuPaul show of the same name. On the 1st of January 2022, another channel by

384
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:37,420
the name of TopRPDRVideos uploaded a video accusing Butterface of ripping their content

385
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:42,460
without providing any credit, subsequently profiting off the success of this content.

386
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:47,140
In our case, this channel went as far as using parts of our videos instead of hunting down

387
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:52,220
the original material itself, like it happened with this channel not so long ago, which

388
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:55,660
is not only immoral, it's also very much illegal.

389
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:59,260
Butterface then put out a response to this video, and although apologising for any use

390
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:03,580
of the original creator's material, denied that they were a content farm of any sorts,

391
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:07,780
with a fully documented backstory and a variety of inspirations for their channel. However,

392
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:12,460
this was further taken apart by TopRPDRVideos and the community as a whole, ripping into

393
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:17,020
the inconsistencies and insincerity of such a post, with further evidence that the channel

394
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:18,700
was merely a content farm.

395
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:23,060
Meanwhile, a channel called Gringey popped up in my comment section. He took a break

396
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:27,780
from YouTube. He says his videos were stolen as well.

397
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:31,260
And if I was sad before, now I'm starting to get a little bit upset.

398
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:37,180
Oh, wait a moment, what the hell is this? I'm lucky Wao hasn't noticed. No legal team,

399
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:42,700
they don't mind me. They don't mind you? Didn't you just say, oh, no, no, no, no, no, sorry.

400
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:46,760
That was part of the introductory spin on the narrative designed to gain more sympathy

401
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:51,580
before trying to perform some good old character assassination.

402
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:54,360
Emotions over facts, people. Emotions over facts.

403
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:58,260
There was one key detail amongst this all that piqued the interest of onlookers from

404
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:02,800
T-channels, and that was the accusation of the involvement of Anna Oop.

405
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:07,960
It seems like Team Anna Oop, being a famous YouTuber with millions of subscribers, thought

406
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:13,920
it would be nice to help her friend Team Butterface with her own channel, not by, you know, inviting

407
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:19,480
her on her channel, do collaboration, helping her develop her reputation and the connection

408
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:23,680
with her viewership, like we have basically seen happening everywhere else on YouTube

409
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:28,640
since its inception. No, no, no, no. She helped by designing her thumbnail.

410
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:32,520
Yes, in Butterface posts, they credit a close friend for helping them get their channel

411
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:37,960
off the ground. They don't say who, but TopRPDRvideo seems pretty certain that this special someone

412
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:41,920
is Anna Oop. Although there is no solidified evidence to confirm this beyond a shadow of

413
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:46,160
a doubt, it's certainly planted a seed for people to start digging, and not too long

414
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:49,520
after, another creator appeared on the scene, Paige Christie.

415
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:52,480
Paige Christie Today, we are talking about another bustling

416
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,960
content farm called Anna Oop.

417
00:30:55,960 --> 00:31:00,080
Page Christie is a commentator who has covered the topic of content farms before, most notably

418
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:04,040
the Spill saga that followed a similar storyline. She had already expressed her doubts over

419
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:08,800
the legitimacy of both Anna Oop and Butterface's channels earlier on in the previous year,

420
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:12,040
and now seemed to have the evidence to prove that they were both connected.

421
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:14,880
Paige Christie Butterface's first video, and underneath

422
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:20,040
their first video, which is every single time Monet X Change came for Tamisha Iman, which

423
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:26,600
was posted on the 16th of June 2021, there was a comment. A comment left by Anna Oop,

424
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:30,480
and the comment read as follows. Hi guys, I see some of y'all are commenting

425
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:36,520
that my friend is copying me. I love the art of drag, and so does my friend, and when they

426
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:40,960
said they were interested in making a channel, I wanted to help out where I could, so I helped

427
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:45,800
them with the thumbnail design, gave them some editing tips. Please, no hate to them.

428
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:53,140
P.S. I love butter, this video goes off. Butterface responded with, thank you queen, I probably

429
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:57,460
should have mentioned somewhere that you gave me some tips. I completely understand everyone's

430
00:31:57,460 --> 00:32:02,520
concerns in the comments. Love you too. And this comment, can I just say, has since

431
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:10,200
been deleted. The admission that the thumbnails were created at that point by Anna Oop was

432
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:14,320
all I needed to then go and do some dirty investigation.

433
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:19,000
This is pretty damning information, particularly when combined with the collective research prior.

434
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,240
It proved that there was an undeniable connection between Butterface and Anna Oop, and if Butterface

435
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:27,000
was indeed as corporate as they appear to be, then unless they fooled Anna too, there

436
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,360
was no real alternative explanation for how such a scenario could have transpired. If

437
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:35,560
Anna truly was a friend, then unfortunately that friend was a business. I assume this

438
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:39,200
was a shock to some, but I think most who followed the situation were just waiting for

439
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:44,080
their suspicions to be confirmed. The truth was that we were seeing one person supposedly

440
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:49,360
pumping out up to an hour of highly produced yet fundamentally hollow content every week.

441
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:52,600
It simultaneously was too bad, and too good to be true.

442
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:57,840
Butterface is not returned, and I think it's because they know that they don't goof, because

443
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:02,560
the comments underneath a lot of people are beginning to realize that this is a conglomerate,

444
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:06,840
and especially when it comes down to straight up stealing other people's content, this is

445
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:09,260
now majorly overstepping a line.

446
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:12,840
The evidence had been stacking up for a while, but with all of it accumulating in one place,

447
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:17,140
it enabled people to understand the depth of this masquerade. Behind it, a very telling

448
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:21,560
story about Anna Oop, that this person who would use their status as a self-proclaimed

449
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:25,880
human being to tell stories, plead their case with YouTube on multiple occasions, and even

450
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:30,500
talk about personal challenges going on in their life was simply not a person at all,

451
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:35,320
and there was no way that anyone involved had merely accidentally acted like an individual.

452
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:39,820
This was a fully committed facade, filled to the brim with first-person pronouns. They

453
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:43,240
knew what they were doing, and they were making a killing from it.

454
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:46,480
But who were they? Well, there was still a little more to uncover.

455
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:58,660
One channel that kept coming up when I would do a thumbnail search for thumbnails that

456
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:05,540
look similar to it was a channel called Rumored. Then I went into Rumored's featured channels,

457
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:09,800
and I came across another channel called This Happened. As you can see, they all have the

458
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:15,000
same thumbnail style. And then from This Happened, I went and checked out their featured channels

459
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:20,960
tab, and would you look at it, there are some people there that we should recognise.

460
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:24,880
One person called Anna Uncovered, in Paige's video, she showed that there appeared to be

461
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:28,760
a nexus of channels connected to each other. Some of these were channels that did masquerade

462
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:32,600
as individual creators, whereas others were presented under the more corporate pretense.

463
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:36,700
However, on researching one of the channel's URLs, Paige found something else.

464
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:40,560
Is that all of the rest of the channels did not have a customised HTML, so their YouTube

465
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:46,640
HTML is youtube.com forward slash c forward slash Daniel O Games. Daniel with the O being

466
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:53,280
massive games, uppercase S, lowercase s. So one of the jobs it shows is female voice artists

467
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:58,260
for big celeb channels, as well as the second one that was posted 29th of November, which

468
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:03,280
is an American female voice artist for a celeb channel. So the advert reads as follows, they

469
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:08,960
need 10 freelancers. Hello, we are a company called Video Creation Hub. We own several

470
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:13,800
YouTube channels, and one of them is in the celebrity niche. To give you an example of

471
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:18,360
the style of work that we're after, check out these channels, and one of them is the

472
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:22,700
channel This Happened, and the other channel is Pop Juice. This layered down a further

473
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:27,460
rabbit hole which revealed two companies, Creolone and Video Creation Hub, both of whom

474
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:34,240
specialised in one thing, YouTube automation. So O works for Video Creation Hub, which are

475
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:40,280
the people who created this Upwork advert. And on LinkedIn, they state that they are

476
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:44,720
a content writer, a freelance writer, and a contributing writer. But not only do they

477
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:50,000
work for the Video Creation Hub, they also work for another company called Creolone Media.

478
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:55,160
So the Video Creation Hub essentially is a company that considers YouTube profiles as

479
00:35:55,160 --> 00:36:00,320
real estate. They do something that they call YouTube automation. In essence, these companies

480
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:04,240
are specially designed to build and consolidate large channels and their fanbases. They now

481
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:10,200
have to communicate with the Gen Z mind. They don't really list their techniques on

482
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:14,040
the page, trade secrets I suppose, but then again, I feel at this point it's somewhat

483
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:19,020
evident. So this began to paint another very different picture. There may actually be individuals

484
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:22,880
behind the channels themselves, but the production comes from a third-party company who turns

485
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:27,200
that concept into a content farm. Page then provides further evidence to support this,

486
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,600
and it begins to look a bit dystopian, honestly.

487
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:34,880
An editor from Blank. Passionate about music, entertainment, writing, Dee has put her love

488
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:41,200
for them together, and specialises in music and entertainment journalism. Currently, Dee

489
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:46,080
is a scriptwriter at Creolone Media Group, where she writes several scripts a week for

490
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:48,960
the Butterface YouTube channel.

491
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:53,480
Creolone Media appears to be aiming for a plethora of genres in the coming months, advertising

492
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:58,640
roles in channels relating to soccer, text phase horror, rap music. They are essentially

493
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:02,400
shooting for world domination, or the next best thing. This was daunting.

494
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:09,680
These people essentially create entire automated channels with voiceover artists, with writers,

495
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:18,480
with researchers, with editors, with thumbnail creators, with graphic designers, with producers,

496
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:23,320
with literally just everything it is that you could possibly need to have a channel

497
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,320
and make it run.

498
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:28,080
Though there was very little to add at the end of Page's video, she channels the frustration

499
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:31,720
of an individual creator who sees many of her peers struggling to keep up with the sort

500
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:36,200
of farm that companies like Creolone and Video Creation Hub are operating. Not necessarily

501
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:39,960
being bothered by their existence, but more about the lie that they wanted to present

502
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:43,800
themselves as one of us. Page also made a follow up video where she briefly spoke to

503
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:47,080
truth for reality, and gave his side of the story more attention as well.

504
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:51,480
Yeah, I reached out to her on two occasions. I wasn't going to strike the videos, I just

505
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:55,720
wanted her to credit my work. No response. So then they tried to threaten me through

506
00:37:55,720 --> 00:38:00,400
emails with a lawyer. The whole thing is a joke. It really wasn't that serious to me.

507
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:06,080
So then I asked him if he had a copy of the email that was sent by Anna Solves, and he

508
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:10,480
basically said to me, he said that he doesn't have it, and that the account that they emailed

509
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:16,160
from tried to email him a PDF file. He says that those are often used for malicious attacks,

510
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:20,840
so he blocked the account and erased the entire thread. So take that information whichever

511
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:25,960
way you want to. I'm more inclined to believe this young man, only because it's not just

512
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:31,400
him who's saying it. There are several people echoing the same sentiment, and several people

513
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:37,120
who came over to my video unprovoked to tell me the exact same thing, that Anna Solves

514
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,880
steals content from other content creators.

515
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:43,920
This was arguably the most serious claim relating to the drama, and certainly asked more of

516
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:47,680
the companies behind the channels. It also placed the ball firmly in the court of Anna

517
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:51,400
Oop Butterface and the rest of the channel syndicates. However, their response was more

518
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:55,720
to erase evidence. As noted in Paige's video, the comment from Anna was quickly deleted

519
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:59,240
after it was discovered. The video that comment appeared on was subsequently set to private

520
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:03,120
as well, and a large majority of leads that Paige followed in her video were removed or

521
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:07,200
hidden. Although Anna would later use the phrase, are videos on Twitter, this seems

522
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:11,880
to be the closest that there is to an acknowledgement that this is more than one person. However,

523
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:16,400
in a way, sometimes a lack of response can be considered a response in itself. Outside

524
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:20,520
of the occasional tweet, Anna Oop's social media accounts largely fell silent. They stopped

525
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:24,080
posting on their community tab altogether on each of their channels, and just returned

526
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:29,880
to the regular upload schedule. Anna Oop still has a personality, unfortunately, but outside

527
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:33,960
of the content, there is no real attempt to build a fanbase. AnnaPlays, the channel that

528
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:37,660
was designed to cultivate a closer relationship between the channel and the audience, uploaded

529
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:42,480
their last video in May 2022, and has been dormant since. Interestingly, not nearly a

530
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:47,180
month after, another channel returned to the platform, Butterface, with a video about drag

531
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:51,540
queen drama. What a surprise. Their video on the topic of a queen pretending to be a

532
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:56,300
ready to defend themselves was at least somewhat ironic, but the description was what was even

533
00:39:56,300 --> 00:40:00,620
more interesting. Here they drop the guise of being an individual person, and admit that

534
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:05,220
they are operated by a company, and realise the ethical qualms of behaving in such a way.

535
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:08,840
They want to do better, and have since adapted to a more corporate format to distinguish

536
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:12,980
themselves from other individual creators. This wouldn't have been a bad response if

537
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:17,540
this had been their first response. Unfortunately, they already had one shot at explaining themselves,

538
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:21,220
and many people considered this apology to be a result of their failure to maintain the

539
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:25,480
masquerade. I think the apology also rang hollow in the greater sense as well, because

540
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:28,980
other channels that were seemingly friends with Butterface, and were ruined to be a part

541
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:33,340
of this syndicate, most notably Anna Oop, were still using personal branding to do just

542
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:37,960
what Butterface admitted to be unethical. But sometimes, friends have different opinions

543
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:38,960
I suppose.

544
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:41,100
Anna Oop I'm sorry, but why does every Kardashian

545
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:46,020
or Jenner out there try to ruin their memes by profiting off them, and reusing them over

546
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:47,020
and over again?

547
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:49,260
TRO Nonetheless, the apology did serve as strong

548
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:52,820
confirmation for the broader theory surrounding these channels, and ultimately proved that

549
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:57,100
no matter what was hidden, the explanation remained the same. Anna Oop was not who they

550
00:40:57,100 --> 00:41:01,100
said they were, and they were just one of the many channels that began to infiltrate

551
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:05,620
and create a sphere. Who knows what these channels are, or if we can even identify them,

552
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:09,660
but regardless, if Butterface or Anna Oop's presence meant anything, it meant that they

553
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:10,660
were already here.

554
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:13,940
It's a pretty simple observation to make, but I think what bothered people the most

555
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:17,820
was just the lie in the first place. It's not like this was the only way for corporate

556
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:21,860
channels to survive in the 21st century, there is more than enough proof you can thrive in

557
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:25,220
your own space regardless of who owns you, and there are more than enough successful

558
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:29,140
channels to demonstrate that. They just wanted a piece of the pie, and it makes sense in

559
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:30,140
a way.

560
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:33,700
Personally fronted YouTube channels have far better audience retention, compare a channel

561
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:40,420
like Anna Oop with Pop Juice. Pop Juice presently has 129 million views with 220,000 subscribers,

562
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:45,660
Anna Oop had 440,000 subscribers with half the amount of cumulative views. The whole

563
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:49,480
reason retention is higher is because viewers think you're a real person, which might

564
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:53,140
be considered a bit of a deal breaker when you're not.

565
00:41:53,140 --> 00:42:02,340
So who is the real Anna Oop?

566
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:06,220
As we kinda found out already, there's certainly a degree of deception involved in the curation

567
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:09,940
of these channels, but when establishing the timeline for this situation, you'll realise

568
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:13,440
there are more smoke and mirrors that had not been accounted for. Let's start from

569
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:17,820
the top with one simple factoid that we know to be true, Anna Oop's channel was launched

570
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:22,260
on the 12th of May 2019. That makes sense in this timeline given the channel's subsequent

571
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:26,740
success in the following years. However, we also know that around the start of 2020,

572
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:30,740
Anna Oop conducted an overhaul on their channel, their social media accounts, and a large number

573
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:35,500
of videos were subsequently deleted. I can't give you the exact reason why without speculation,

574
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:39,180
but I did say I would return to this point, and that's because there is something interesting

575
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:43,140
about their original Twitter that has been preserved, and that is the use of plural pronouns

576
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:47,360
to describe their channel. At first when I found it, I assumed that it could be a typo,

577
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:51,180
but it kept appearing, and appearing, and appearing, to a point where I assumed that

578
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:55,440
it must have been intentional. Anna Oop started out as a corporate channel that knew to an

579
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:59,540
extent it was just that. Although there seemed to be an individual person assigned to their

580
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:04,460
social media, the channel was quite transparent about it being more than one person. However,

581
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:08,620
by May 2020, this had completely changed, and even their YouTube description read that

582
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:12,660
they were a 21 year old girl from America, which I always found such a strange detail

583
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:16,260
to include in their channel because I don't think that many people could care enough about

584
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:20,780
their about page to update it with every passing birthday. I switched to voiceovers that start

585
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:25,180
the new year also changed the game with respect to how Anna operated. They moved towards this

586
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:28,740
more personal bond with their audience, and began to integrate things like birthdays,

587
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:32,940
Q&As, things that would draw people in. It was the next step of the business model. This

588
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:37,020
one didn't raise too many abject suspicions at the time because it seemed like a natural

589
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:40,700
progression, revealing something personal about yourself, it all seemed fair and square.

590
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:44,780
However, with the next step, the expansion, some more evidence of suspicious behaviour

591
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:45,780
emerges.

592
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:51,060
So their YouTube HTML is youtube.com forward slash c forward slash Daniel O Games. Daniel

593
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:55,780
with the O being massive, games, uppercase S, lowercase s.

594
00:43:55,780 --> 00:44:00,540
When watching Betty Page's video, I was surprised when she mentioned Popjuice's URL, that being

595
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:05,800
of Danielo Games. I struggle to rethink what Danielo and his games had to do with a social

596
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:10,020
media channel covering trending topics, but more interestingly, I'd noticed this when

597
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:15,280
researching the Anna franchise earlier on in the day. What do I mean by this? The interesting

598
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:19,760
detail about Anna's secondary projects is that Anna Solve's, Anna Uncovered, and

599
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:24,380
Anna Horror Story's channels were seemingly founded before Anna Oop's own channel was.

600
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:28,800
This wasn't something dubious beyond doubt, plenty of people of old channels may revamp

601
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:33,180
for content production, but it certainly made one curious, and then you go to the archives

602
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:37,280
of these channels, and on each of these accounts you will find an old screenshot of the channel

603
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:41,680
belonging to someone who seemingly has no relation to Anna Oop whatsoever. These channels

604
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:46,220
typically display around a five-figure subscriber count, and seemingly all relate to Hispanic

605
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:50,120
content creators, which are also found to be a very strange connection, so it appears

606
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:54,360
the people behind the Anna Oop channel purchased these channels as they believed it would maximise

607
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:58,640
their chances for subscriber growth, which also explains why Anna was so close to reaching

608
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:03,320
100,000 subscribers so soon after their first video on the Anna Solve channel.

609
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:07,400
However, when returning to this theory today, I hit a roadblock, because the Anna Horror

610
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:12,040
Story's channel that I pulled up said it was created in June 2021, which would have

611
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:15,980
been around the time the channel went live. I took a moment to wonder whether I'd just

612
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:19,800
made a mistake, it wouldn't be the first time, but I thought I'd retrace my steps

613
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:24,600
to the tweet promoting the channel. I followed the link on the tweets, and then it hit me.

614
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:30,160
There are two different Anna Horror Story's channels. Has anyone ever noticed this? It

615
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:34,600
appears the second Anna Horror Story's channel had picked up where the first one left off.

616
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:38,520
I was mobbing on the first channel in May, and resuming on the second channel in June.

617
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:42,600
My guess would be monetisation issues as I didn't see any ads on the first channel,

618
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:47,000
but it's still an utterly bizarre situation. Normally you'd expect Anna to take to Twitter,

619
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:50,980
but there's just this strange period of radio silence, and no evidence that they ever attempted

620
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:54,820
to have the lack of monetisation on that channel changed, which is also surprising given they

621
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:58,720
regularly complain to YouTube when they feel they've been maltreated. Perhaps this time

622
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:02,280
they kinda knew what they were doing was wrong and didn't want to attract attention to

623
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:06,640
it, but that's just a guess. Beyond the assumption these channels were bought, I mean I doubt

624
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:10,680
Anna was also a male Mexican gamer in their spare time, the Anna Horror Story's channel's

625
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:14,600
URL was advertised in a forum a few weeks before the Anna Horror Story's channel was

626
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:17,360
launched. The link speaks for itself.

627
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:21,000
Now on principle I don't really mind people trading accounts, people can cultivate what

628
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:25,160
they want and pass it on for all I care, however buying accounts often does beat a very dangerous

629
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:28,940
side of YouTube, the one where people hack accounts to sell them on. I'm sure we all

630
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:33,800
know creatives had their channel turned into a Tesla fan page recently, it's not fun.

631
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:37,080
And although I doubt the team behind Anna Oop is hacking these channels themselves,

632
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:40,040
it definitely speaks to the corporate approach of content farms they wouldn't consider the

633
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:43,880
trade they're participating in. In the case of the Anna Horror Story's channel, despite

634
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:47,340
previously being a Spanish speaking channel, it was being advertised by an American or

635
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:51,680
Canadian user whose approval for monetisation message was written in English. It's not

636
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:55,900
evidence beyond a doubt because Spanish speaking people do live in America, but it's food

637
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:59,860
for thought, yet it's not something that Anna's team would ever think or care about

638
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:01,140
themselves.

639
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:04,340
As they expanded, they assumed they'd hire more and more people for these channels, and

640
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:08,620
having less ability to actually critically stay in touch with the content they were creating.

641
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:12,040
In a way, ironically, this worked somewhat to their advantage, whereas a channel like

642
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:16,420
Spill's content drew suspicion for being too good for a single person, Anna Oop and

643
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:20,020
their accompanying channels never had to worry about that, they occupied this position where

644
00:47:20,020 --> 00:47:24,140
they could pull off the act of being human through what appeared to be human error. So

645
00:47:24,140 --> 00:47:27,700
just because something's human doesn't mean it's good. In the meantime, their social

646
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:31,820
media started drawing with a variety of creators, especially easy targets that would embolden

647
00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:35,740
their status in the community, calling out others and using a face reveal bait to launch

648
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:40,460
a distract on their detractors. It all pointed to one thing, Anna Oop et al weren't just

649
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:44,380
a content farm, they were a bad content farm, and the only way they were able to keep their

650
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:48,960
feet on the ground in this genre was pretending to be a singular person, and simply outmaneuvering

651
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:53,140
all the actual people by rigging an algorithm in their favour by buying channels and strafe

652
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:58,060
running content, while holding hollow opinions that align with yours to keep them watching.

653
00:47:58,060 --> 00:48:03,060
And the worst thing about it, is that it completely, 100% worked.

654
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:16,820
There's one more point I want to make regarding Butterface's apology, and that's a video

655
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:18,380
that was published alongside it.

656
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:23,540
Fans wanted to get to the bottom of things themselves, and even one fan tweeted Trinity

657
00:48:23,540 --> 00:48:27,580
and asked her point blank if the account was hers, to which she responded,

658
00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:29,780
Oh yes, I'm still on Reddit.

659
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:36,140
You might be thinking, ooh girl, that sounds like a confession. Well, it is, but it also

660
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:37,740
isn't, if that makes sense.

661
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:41,020
It's not exactly an objectionable video, but it's so strange seeing a channel that

662
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:45,420
is a self-admitted corporation trying to use jargon with intonations that it doesn't

663
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:48,780
feel like they can ever truly understand. Sure, they've dropped the guise that they're

664
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:52,540
a real person, they've said they understand why it's ethically questionable to do so,

665
00:48:52,540 --> 00:48:55,580
but they're still trying to pull off that attitude that garnered them the attention

666
00:48:55,580 --> 00:48:58,640
in the first place. With the knowledge that there are people behind the scenes pulling

667
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:02,780
the strings to make this video appealing to you, it just feels rather weird.

668
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:06,420
Audiences like to feel they're in control of the content they consume, and that's

669
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:09,420
why the difference between a rather generic corporate channel, and one that's trying

670
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:13,580
to yassify their view count comes into play. A middle ground corporate channel just wants

671
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:17,760
the view, the click, it's a transactional thing that both parties are aware of. These

672
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:21,820
channels though, they do something different, they commercialise the viewer's connection

673
00:49:21,820 --> 00:49:25,400
with the community and the culture that comes with it, so they appropriate parts of it to

674
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:29,380
appeal to people. To be honest, it's not that I think it's inherently immoral to

675
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:33,400
do that, but I think it does make people uncomfortable, and I don't think people are often willing

676
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:37,460
to support a channel like that, which is probably why the guise of an individual person is always

677
00:49:37,460 --> 00:49:42,320
going to be more effective, even if you gave a corporation personality. Unfortunately,

678
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:45,680
it's just not believable that there are a bunch of guys in suits who are genuinely

679
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:50,240
shook over whatever's being said between online influencers. Companies just don't

680
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:54,840
have the merit to appear legitimately interested in certain circles of culture, but it can't

681
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:56,320
stop them from trying.

682
00:49:56,320 --> 00:50:00,740
As a corporate channel, Anna Oop had very few defining features, no exceptional research,

683
00:50:00,740 --> 00:50:05,240
no great wisdom to impart, but as a person, their personality perfectly fit into a community

684
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:09,920
that welcomed the characteristically audacious creator who just says what she feels and doesn't

685
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:12,680
have a damn who tries to stop her tea-spilling endeavours.

686
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:17,200
Anna Oop We all sat through hours and hours of cringe

687
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:23,320
music this year, and I think we all understood that influencers should not make music. Unless

688
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:26,160
you're the hypocritical b**** that is me, of course.

689
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:28,260
TRO Say what you want about Spill, I think many

690
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:31,840
gave them their fair share of criticism back in the day, but they weren't necessarily

691
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:35,880
bad at what they were doing. The least I can say about them is that in the general discourse

692
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:39,640
of corporate-based channels, they did a decent job at keeping their audience informed and

693
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:43,360
maintained. They presented content in a way that many channels simply could not, and those

694
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:47,800
are two of the key tenets of any YouTube channel that I mentioned in the introduction.

695
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:52,060
Anna Oop, on the other hand, was just mass-produced junk food content. I think that's what bothers

696
00:50:52,060 --> 00:50:56,200
me the most about their channel as a concept. Corporations do have the ability to do what

697
00:50:56,200 --> 00:51:00,000
many individual creators cannot, and they can achieve great feats with their resources

698
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,080
and manpower. Have the team behind Anna Oop settled on purposely being less than that

699
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:08,160
because they wanted the illusion of humanity? All these opinions about who was in the right

700
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:13,120
or wrong in their content, possibly fabricated to play to a crowd. It's risky business

701
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:17,920
doing that, and easily leads to contradictions that could harm people involved or mentioned.

702
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:22,480
The truth is that everything is an algorithm to some extent, even personal values and expressions

703
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:27,000
of those that can supposedly organically draw an audience in. It's an inevitability, and

704
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,240
plenty of creators have been called out in their time for expressing opinions they may

705
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:34,320
not truly hold. Playing to the crowd is common. However, when you engineer channels with the

706
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:37,640
sole intent to play into the crowd, not only do you reduce the realm of critical thought

707
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:42,000
in that genre, you also may make a lot of damn additional mistakes. The majority opinion

708
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:46,200
isn't always the right one. Making errors is part of life as an individual creator,

709
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:50,240
we're only human and we strive to grow. At the same time, I think most creators' lives

710
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:53,360
would be easier if we didn't make those errors and didn't have to deal with the

711
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:56,920
guilt and shame that comes with them. To have a corporate network, the creative formula

712
00:51:56,920 --> 00:52:00,800
to enable those errors is just insulting to the people who spend hours trying to avoid

713
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:05,700
such pitfalls. It also amplifies harm that can be spread through falsehoods and misrepresentations

714
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:09,780
that may not have spread otherwise. This was especially valid with the true crime genre,

715
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:14,600
a section of YouTube that demands meticulousness and dignity for all those involved. The incompetence

716
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:18,700
of Anna Sols could not have just prospectively damaged other creators in the domain, but

717
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:23,140
also victims and their families as well who are often the subject of these stories. That's

718
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:26,820
why a personal connection to the content is often important, because that connection will

719
00:52:26,820 --> 00:52:30,420
provide you with an inherent motive to be sensitive to the world around you, otherwise

720
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:34,300
the only real motive that exists is the one the numbers, and sometimes the numbers will

721
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:37,940
tell you to do something different to the people. Sure, the best way to attract clicks

722
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:42,180
is to exaggerate titles and thumbnails, while dramatising the story and asking viewers what

723
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:46,380
do you think about this mass murderer, but not all content should be treated that way.

724
00:52:46,380 --> 00:52:50,100
When Anna Oop moved from the T to true crime, there wasn't any real acknowledgement of

725
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:54,260
the sheer differences between the two realms. Too many businesses don't distinguish that

726
00:52:54,260 --> 00:52:58,160
one genre may have different rules to another, because they lack that personal connection

727
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:03,140
to understand the nuances, which is what caused so much unrest in the true crime community.

728
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:07,660
People felt that Anna didn't respect those cases, and they may well have been correct.

729
00:53:07,660 --> 00:53:11,300
The other problem with seeing matters only through numbers is how you interpret the absence

730
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:15,300
of others, and how you interact with criticism. The Truth Through Reality situation showed

731
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:19,280
us that, separate to the point of copyright altogether, the Anna Solves community post

732
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:23,000
projected the intention of a channel like theirs onto a channel like Truth's, who

733
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:26,860
for all intents and purposes doesn't actually sincerely care about the stories he covers.

734
00:53:26,860 --> 00:53:30,500
It's particularly illuminating the comparison of the response to someone like Truth, a smaller

735
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:35,000
creator, and Mr Balan, a larger creator. One video is taken down swiftly and silently,

736
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:39,120
the other resulted in a public campaign that only stalled when people called them out for

737
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:42,500
it. And alright, maybe they would have been able to pass as a person with less outrage

738
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:46,760
if they'd merely created content and avoided any outside interactions, but they used this

739
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:51,120
perception as a human to instigate drama with other creators and elicit sympathy from their

740
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:55,300
viewers. It gave them the ability to use those human emotions to leverage favourable outcomes

741
00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:59,100
and just attention in general. How that sort of attention could only yield so much good

742
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:03,100
when your own shortcomings become more noticeable, and the channels around you begin to falter

743
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:07,460
as well. Even businesses stretch themselves thin trying to cut corners, and the same numbers

744
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:10,780
that tell you the more content the better make you forget about the other numbers that

745
00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:14,820
gave you those numbers in the first place. In the end, even without an admission, people

746
00:54:14,820 --> 00:54:33,420
felt the mask had slipped, an inhuman schedule with an inhumane approach. All was undone.

747
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:36,980
Nothing was real.

748
00:54:36,980 --> 00:54:46,500
I suppose behind the scenes there are many ways that the AnnoOops squad could have responded

749
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:50,380
with which we would not necessarily be aware of. They could have found a person with a

750
00:54:50,380 --> 00:54:53,660
bit more experience in the community, and given them greater reins over the research

751
00:54:53,660 --> 00:54:57,500
and production. They could have centralised the channel's presence more on an individual,

752
00:54:57,500 --> 00:55:01,100
given them control of operations, or at least helped them oversee the work being done on

753
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:04,900
their behalf. They're never gonna be as organic as some, but for all we know these

754
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:08,580
are steps that could have been taken since being called out, which is why I don't want

755
00:55:08,580 --> 00:55:12,740
to presently malign them too much when not entitled to know exactly everything someone

756
00:55:12,740 --> 00:55:17,540
is doing to improve themselves. However, it's hard to say that outside of that, any individual

757
00:55:17,540 --> 00:55:20,980
passion has been developed for the content they're creating, although avoiding any

758
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:24,700
large scale controversies have still occasionally been called out and criticised for a lack

759
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:28,700
of originality in their content. A recent video, in particular from a YouTuber by the

760
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:32,800
name of The Asher Show, alleges that they have copied his topics multiple times, without

761
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:34,640
providing any credits.

762
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:12,600
Two months ago, November 5th, I made this video the history of the most hated person

763
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:20,060
on TikTok. It did quite well, 889,000 views, but here three weeks ago, January 6th, the

764
00:56:20,060 --> 00:56:24,860
childish TikToker who got cancelled for being annoying. It's getting a little too coincidental

765
00:56:24,860 --> 00:56:30,620
at this point. November 26th, 2022, I posted this. Anna Oop posted this January 9th, 2023.

766
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:34,480
And the weirdest part about this, nothing in the description, no references here, but

767
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:38,700
everyone just take a listen, and who is speaking at the beginning of this video?

768
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:44,420
Baguette! Baguette sauce! Meatballs!

769
00:56:44,420 --> 00:56:47,460
Hate people that waste food, why do you have to waste food on TikTok?

770
00:56:47,460 --> 00:56:51,700
No thanks! Come on! Just a little bit.

771
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:56,140
It's like, the more food you waste, the more views it gets. Why?

772
00:56:56,140 --> 00:56:57,140
Idiot!

773
00:56:57,140 --> 00:57:02,660
It's not funny, you're just being completely wasteful. Am I on the Anna Oop payroll now?

774
00:57:02,660 --> 00:57:04,340
Now I'm voicing your channel?

775
00:57:04,340 --> 00:57:08,180
There are a few examples here that I think fall into a grey area, and I'm not sure

776
00:57:08,180 --> 00:57:12,420
they point to the degree of plagiarism previously covered, but together they definitely do paint

777
00:57:12,420 --> 00:57:16,660
a picture. I don't think this is exactly content theft, but it does kind of represent

778
00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:20,900
what Anna Oop is without the pretense that they're a real person, just a hollow machine

779
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:25,300
that can't produce original thoughts or ideas for themselves. Another notable example

780
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:28,580
of this was Anna Oop's video on Technoblade shortly after his death.

781
00:57:28,580 --> 00:57:33,780
Hello everyone, Technoblade here. If you're watching this, I'm dead.

782
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:37,340
Given that Anna hadn't really shown much investment in the Minecraft community, this

783
00:57:37,340 --> 00:57:40,980
video just seemed really out of place for the channel, and the video itself just felt

784
00:57:40,980 --> 00:57:44,940
like they were regurgitating information they read elsewhere, and adding a delicate piano

785
00:57:44,940 --> 00:57:48,820
to provide it with an illusion of poignancy, with a lot of people calling it out in the

786
00:57:48,820 --> 00:57:49,820
comments.

787
00:57:49,820 --> 00:57:54,140
Alex had rarely shown himself on his YouTube videos, as he made it clear to his fans that

788
00:57:54,140 --> 00:57:59,940
he prefers to present himself as an avatar instead, and guys, his own fans even recognised

789
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:03,060
Technoblade as his real name throughout the years on YouTube.

790
00:58:03,060 --> 00:58:06,900
However, even with content that you'd expect Anna to be a bit more familiar with, you see

791
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:10,900
a lot of comments deriding Anna Oop for their rather obnoxious clickbait, luring people

792
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:14,620
in with borderline false statements. I'd probably have more to say if the topics didn't

793
00:58:14,620 --> 00:58:18,540
bore me so much, but it is absolutely amazing what some people can turn into an 8 minute

794
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:22,460
video today, but then again it's amazing what some people can turn into a 4 hour video

795
00:58:22,460 --> 00:58:23,460
too.

796
00:58:23,460 --> 00:58:30,540
Do y'all love the sound of peace and quiet? Do you wake up in the morning feeling content?

797
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:35,900
No? Yeah. Me neither. Y'all.

798
00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:39,700
To me it doesn't feel like anything's changed at all, and it's hard to change sometimes

799
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:43,020
when you have a formula that's working, and outside of a certain sect of people in

800
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:47,260
the T community, the greater YouTube audience don't tend to watch such content, and majority

801
00:58:47,260 --> 00:58:50,620
people don't care for the drama, they don't read the comments, they don't watch the

802
00:58:50,620 --> 00:58:54,140
videos, they simply don't care, and who can blame them, there are only so many hours

803
00:58:54,140 --> 00:58:57,940
in the day to spend indulging in drama content, and those viewers are probably more interested

804
00:58:57,940 --> 00:59:01,980
in Selena Gomez than they are the person talking about them. The only person to blame really

805
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:06,140
is Anna, and well they're not really a person, they're part of a company doing what they

806
00:59:06,140 --> 00:59:10,060
know best, they say and they do what is best for themselves, they don't relate to that

807
00:59:10,060 --> 00:59:13,740
moral obligation that other creators may do, because from their point of view, what does

808
00:59:13,740 --> 00:59:17,060
it matter whether they are who they say they are if they can deliver content that people

809
00:59:17,060 --> 00:59:20,860
want to watch? Being an influencer on any platform is profitable, they're celebrities

810
00:59:20,860 --> 00:59:24,180
of their own kind who don't have to provide every single detail of their existence if

811
00:59:24,180 --> 00:59:27,820
they don't want to, they don't have to show their face, they don't even have to talk,

812
00:59:27,820 --> 00:59:31,580
it's the perfect combination for someone looking to make a few bucks, you can create

813
00:59:31,580 --> 00:59:35,460
celebrities without proving they're even real. The problem is that when you do that,

814
00:59:35,460 --> 00:59:39,180
you force out individuals who actually are who they say they are. That's why Anna Oop

815
00:59:39,180 --> 00:59:43,020
really was the worst kind of business venture, in their head what they were doing was merely

816
00:59:43,020 --> 00:59:46,860
trying to fit in, succeeding in an area where there wasn't massive competition by corporate

817
00:59:46,860 --> 00:59:50,700
channels, but really what they did was take over a market whose sole existence was based

818
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:54,380
on individuality, and directly competing with creators who could never dream of keeping

819
00:59:54,380 --> 00:59:58,500
up with such a production line. It's like asking IBM to create a computer for your amateur

820
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:02,980
chess tournament, sure the computer is gonna win, but what was the point anyway? They have

821
01:00:02,980 --> 01:00:06,540
their own realms where they can compete, domains where they can succeed and flourish, and generally

822
01:00:06,540 --> 01:00:10,000
facilitate the creation of technology that a single person may struggle with. Although

823
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:14,920
owning all the casual chess players is something they can do, is it something they should do?

824
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:18,840
Beyond the conceptual problem of having companies in control of public opinion, it's bad for

825
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:22,720
other creators as well, we constantly have the discussion on YouTube regarding creator

826
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:26,780
burnout, the fragility of mental health, but a creator's first priority will nearly always

827
01:00:26,780 --> 01:00:30,680
be to keep their channel alive, and if they're competing with people who have infinitely

828
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:34,880
more resources to do that then they will struggle, their channel will either fall to the wayside

829
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:38,520
because they know they can't keep up, or the creator will run out of fuel trying to

830
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:42,320
do so. There's no winning option for the individual here other than to attempt to be

831
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:46,000
a better content farm, and we've already seen the distinct problems with that which

832
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:50,120
can really harm a community. If content is watered down to meet people's expectations

833
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:53,720
then the quality of discourse suffers too, then the only option left for people craving

834
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:58,520
a higher standard of information is for better content farms like Spill. This may well happen,

835
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:03,400
and if audiences choose it then so be it, maybe people enjoy content farms, but I'd

836
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:07,080
like to advocate for the power of the individual creators, the ones who are gonna talk about

837
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:10,660
these subjects because they care about them. Over time plenty more Anna oops are gonna

838
01:01:10,660 --> 01:01:14,060
pop up, and they're gonna masquerade as people because it's their market that can

839
01:01:14,060 --> 01:01:18,040
be tapped. The power of social bond that can be formed is priceless for them, but it's

840
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:22,200
always a one way relationship for a business like theirs. Many of these channels will completely

841
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:26,080
lack a personal connection to their content, and the community that has instilled a social

842
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:29,980
status on them, which is why it was so easy for a channel like Anna's to lie about their

843
01:01:29,980 --> 01:01:34,240
identity in the first place. That's why individuals matter more in these spaces, because

844
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:38,320
there's an expectation to care, an expectation to listen. There's nothing right now I could

845
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:42,920
say to this company, but there's always something you can say to a person. Anna Oop is the sort

846
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:46,000
of channel that I just don't really enjoy, and I honestly wouldn't have too much to

847
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:50,600
say outside of that if Anna was a real content creator, a biased YouTuber who plays with

848
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:54,760
the crowd and is careless with details they should be more diligent with. What's new?

849
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:58,600
But the truth is Anna Oop was more than that, they were a channel that built themselves

850
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:03,280
on a fundamental lie, utilised all the advantages of a well invested company with pre-purchase

851
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:07,220
channels and conveyor belt content, while utilising audience sympathy by complaining

852
01:02:07,220 --> 01:02:11,080
to others about how oppressed they were as an individual creator. They really had their

853
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:15,720
fingers in all the pies. Following these successes, the Anna Oop team had the choice to be better

854
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:20,240
as channels as they branched out into more sensitive subjects, and just chose not to

855
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:24,320
be, using their increased money to just pump out more content rather than improving what

856
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:27,920
they produced as a whole. I think the most sinister fact about the plagiarism case was

857
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:32,160
that Anna Oop took advantage of that humanity, that belief in their identity, and warped

858
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:37,120
into a way to attack a creator who had no motive to maliciously take their content down.

859
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:40,000
Anna Oop has removed countless videos from their channel before, it would have been a

860
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:44,020
drop in the corporate ocean, and yet they went down swinging. When the whole network

861
01:02:44,020 --> 01:02:47,900
was called out, they just scaled down the project a little, still passing their content

862
01:02:47,900 --> 01:02:52,640
off from a first person perspective with tons of tea spilling opinions to this day. It's

863
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:57,560
all a crock of shit, a big crock of shit, and part of me expects I should be more bothered,

864
01:02:57,560 --> 01:03:01,200
but in the end this just feels inevitable, there's only so many arguments I could make

865
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:05,540
surrounding their existence, and all I'd finish on is why would we need companies pretending

866
01:03:05,540 --> 01:03:12,560
to be YouTubers when we already have YouTubers? What does Anna Oop really offer? Businesses

867
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:17,900
on YouTube, for better and for worse they're here to stay, and in many cases I try not

868
01:03:17,900 --> 01:03:22,300
to view their presence as a wholly negative feature, but they can be, especially when

869
01:03:22,300 --> 01:03:25,920
all they offer is a highly processed form of content that is propped up by communities

870
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:30,280
they'll never truly understand. Anna Oop is an example of that, and one can only hope

871
01:03:30,360 --> 01:03:35,640
their formula isn't one that is duplicated too often. However, if they are here to stay,

872
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:41,640
I hope they remember there are some things you can't, and shouldn't, invent. Thank you.

873
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:07,280
average of one to two videos per day so it's quite literally physically impossible that

874
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:13,320
Anna Oop doesn't have any help with at least to prove to you guys without a shadow of a

875
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:19,180
doubt that Anna Oop, one of the biggest T channels, one of the biggest drama content

876
01:04:19,180 --> 01:04:26,180
creators here on the platform is a part of a massive content farm. Anna Oop!

877
01:04:30,280 --> 01:04:36,640
Ok guys, that was the video, I hope you all enjoyed it, thank you if you made it this

878
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:41,480
far. I'd first like to give a big shout out to the editors, once again their names will

879
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:45,480
be on the screen, and in the pinned comment they do a great job, if you wanna check out

880
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:49,600
more of their work it'll be down there below to have a look at. I wanna give a big thanks

881
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:55,160
to my patrons, $10 patrons on the screen right now, thank you so much for your contribution

882
01:04:55,160 --> 01:05:03,920
guys, and also my $50 patrons, Laura Woodward, Sari Tish, Esther Bedoya, and Hypercube. Thank

883
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:08,000
you so much, these guys have been around for a pretty decent amount of time now so I really

884
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:12,260
do appreciate it. What else do I need to thank? I feel like I'm missing something. Big thanks

885
01:05:12,260 --> 01:05:18,760
to Thumbnail by Starpo, big thanks to the artists who do wonderful art, great in the

886
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:23,880
video, if your art is featured in this video and you're looking for credit then just let

887
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:29,000
me know. Merch, as I said we're still doing merch, I really like the mugs we do, if you

888
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:35,000
wanna check them out, once again, link will be in the pinned comment, and it's getting

889
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:40,080
a bit hot up here so I'll probably wrap it up quickly, but hope you enjoyed the video,

890
01:05:40,080 --> 01:05:43,160
and I'm The Right Opinion, and I'll see you in the next one.

891
01:05:53,880 --> 01:06:03,880
Thank you so much for watching, and I'll see you in the next one.
