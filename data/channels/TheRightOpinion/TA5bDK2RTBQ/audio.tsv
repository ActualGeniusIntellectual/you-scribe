0	18420	Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time.
18420	24680	A mainstream TV, a contraption that, contrary to release held by many netizens, people do actually still watch.
24680	31040	Sharks, advanced sports technology is at the forefront of a new sport that's sweeping the entire nation like a tidal wave.
31040	35640	Sharks, this is the National Association of Bubble Soccer.
35640	50040	It's not a necessity in modern day society, with the rise of online content and streaming platforms,
50040	53160	you can obtain your daily dose of entertainment from a variety of sources.
53160	57880	Yet, although audiences have certainly been spoiled with an abundance of TV series and films,
57880	63280	many live shows have still predominantly remained on broadcast television, well, at least more than others.
63280	70120	These include game shows, news programs, and of course, today's genre that has launched so many successful careers, talk shows.
84040	90680	Now, this isn't to say they don't have their online counterparts, but I think like other shows that retain most of their audience from live TV broadcast,
90680	98320	there is something about watching that sort of content in the moment, as it often operates within a very brief window into the spirit of that specific era.
98320	104120	If you went back and tried to watch an episode of Oprah from 1992, you'd probably find it hasn't dated the best.
104120	107360	I mean, sometimes these episodes are dated by the time they're released.
113160	120400	I digress though, to give them their credit, they have fought hard for their place on the TV Guide,
120400	127520	and they do provide people with content that can keep them in touch with the world around them through a medium that may be more digestible than the traditional outlets.
127520	131400	With this in mind, there aren't too many set rules for creating a successful talk show.
131400	136560	The first rule is that there needs to be some talking, that kind of goes without saying, or with saying I suppose,
136560	142520	but it's also important that the person talking is relatively interesting, and has a personality to present those viewing.
142520	148040	The second rule is that there needs to be people to talk to, otherwise the host is just rambling into the void.
148040	156280	Therefore, they'll either talk to you, the viewer, directly, or there's a live audience drafted into cheer, jeer, or appear as part of the host's wacky shenanigans.
156280	165920	With such a broad church of TV encompassed by these couple tenets, it's no surprise that a plethora of shows have garnered success of the very diverse interpretations of these couple key tenets,
165920	171480	from the preppy positivity of Ellen, to the necessary conflict and consequent chaos of a show like The View.
171480	175960	We just said we don't scream at each other, right? Or is it just you that gets to scream?
175960	176960	Okay, no, no, I agree.
176960	184160	Okay, then lower your voice, because we are very close to each other, and I know you come here to sell a book and try to pick a fight, but we're not going to do it today.
184160	191600	Nevertheless, it follows that such a wide-reaching genre would spawn numerous sub-genres, many of whom have their own means of engagement and corresponding audiences.
191600	200360	While the most significant that arose during the 90s was a star called tabloid talk shows, a controversial and divisive genre that utilized the concept of guest involvement to the maximum.
200400	207440	It soon dawned on TV producers that hosts weren't the only people who could be interesting, and that could serve a purpose as well.
207440	212240	Can you say this, you dumb bitch? Can you read the f***ing line, you stupid bitch?
214240	216240	What are you talking about? What is this?
216240	218240	What do you mean you can replace, bitch?
218240	226680	In the years following, a lot of these shows cropped up that broadcast what would normally be extremely personal disputes, and the explosive confrontations that would follow from them.
226720	233280	Add in many people's desire for their five minutes for fame, and orchestration designed to heighten tension between the parties involved,
233280	238320	and you were often left with highly theatrical, yet extremely real coverage of interpersonal troubles.
238320	241680	For some it was entertaining, but for others it was unwatchable.
241680	251400	Enter stage left Oprah Winfrey, the queen of TV talk shows, who some argue made the industry more accessible to tabloid shows due to the intimate nature of her own.
251440	257320	Her often very personal statements and opinions through the guise of a large media personality caught a lot of people's attention.
257320	268240	With that said, Oprah was also thought to not be entirely comfortable with that presentation, and sought to retain a more conventional and professional structure that wouldn't conflate her with an often turbulent genre.
268240	275400	One of these measures undertaken was to involve experts in certain segments, and provide an extra veneer of credibility for the discourse at hand.
275400	280760	One of these experts was an individual by the name of Phil McGraw, who held a PhD in clinical psychology.
280800	289960	Oprah had met Phil a few years prior while working with his trial consultancy firm CSI, after being sued for statements she had made on her show relating to mad cow disease.
289960	299240	After that beef was settled, she offered McGraw a visiting spot on Oprah, where he would be brought on to discuss questions surrounding relationships and general life hardships with her guests.
299240	305480	With their focus being on the host, a lot of shows experimented with different styles, and not too soon after, we were asking the question,
305480	312240	what if we had an expert in subject X or subject Y as a host, and how would that influence how they interact with their guests?
312240	315400	Dr Phil seemed to serve as the answer to this question.
315400	320000	The only person in the world I've ever wanted to cheer for me was him.
320000	321000	Look at him.
321000	323000	The only person in the world...
323000	324000	Stand up.
328000	333000	You're hiding from him. I want you to look at him, and let me tell you something, I want you to listen.
333240	336480	I don't want you to go off and think about what you're going to say in response.
336480	341200	I want you to listen and look her in the eye and hear what she's saying.
341200	346640	These segments proved to be extremely popular, with Oprah giving them an increasingly regular presence on her program.
346640	354440	As this popularity persisted, Winfrey, being the business person that she is, decided that Dr Phil McGraw's sections had the potential to be its own TV series.
354440	362520	So in 2002, four years after our visiting expert made his debut appearance on Oprah, Dr Phil was launched to impressive ratings that had maintained themselves
362560	370280	during the show's long and illustrious lifespan, receiving multiple Daytime Emmy nominations, and praise from viewers who feel that Dr Phil's more measured approach to his guests
370280	372960	allows them to be viewed through a more human lens.
372960	377800	However, as we've seen with other talk show hosts, what is presented is never quite the full picture.
377800	385280	It should go without saying that TV is very selective, even more so than other mediums, and over time, Dr Phil's show garnered more and more critics,
385280	389160	who questioned the professionalism and ethics behind the treatment of the guests involved,
389160	395880	also culminating in a flurry of allegations made by former employees and guests towards the show's producers, and of course the man himself,
395880	400200	leading many to question whether the show was really a force for good.
400200	407000	Well, ladies, gentlemen, and all complementary variations, today we'll delve into Dr Phil, the rise and success of the show,
407000	416680	alongside its notable social media renaissance, we'll also investigate the controversy and the concomitant ethical questions of our beloved TV title at the centre of today's video.
416680	422360	My friends, let us not dwell any longer, it is time to discuss the dangers of Dr Phil.
423560	425560	And now, ad time.
428040	436920	When it comes to making videos, I have many weapons in my arsenal, but there's one secret weapon that's so powerful, former president George W. Bush wants to invade my house.
436920	444440	You see my friends, I am harbouring a weapon of mass production, so it's time for me to open up and let you see it.
444840	452680	This is vidIQ, yes, the vidIQ, the secret weapon that helps you print out bangers like the Weimar Republic prints money.
452680	459640	How? Let's just say it'll give you much needed help on video titles, titles that will actually make people gaze upon its poetry.
459640	465320	Not enough? How about some time tinkering with the algorithm so it picks up views from trending videos similar to yours?
465320	471160	Maybe stealing some of Jay Aubrey's viewers for your own? I mean, what's that twink gonna do about it?
471160	483400	Now, you're probably worried about your enemies, your competitors, or even your friends. Maybe all three, but don't worry, vidIQ will spy on all those trending keywords they're using, with more commitment and dedication than the KGB.
483400	494440	Now, this powerful weapon can't work if you don't work. Fort is a YouTuber who carries an empty vessel of ideas, a useless being leeching off the nectar of society, that's what.
494600	500360	So that's it, you may say, vidIQ cannot be of any assistance because you simply do not have the imagination.
500360	514600	I mean, it's not like it can come up with 50 video ideas every day for you, right? Wrong. Because it will. 50 ideas each day. Save that pesky thought process for more fitting scenarios like Overwatch 2.
514600	522200	So now you're asking, how can this possibly be? You're thinking, surely there's no team of humans big enough to do all this work for you.
522200	534520	And you're right, no team of humans could ever be big enough for such a colossal task. But what if I told you it's not humans that run this? What if I told you it's all run by a powerful AI?
534520	542840	This AI will scour every inch of YouTube for you, providing you with all the information you could ever need about what those YouTubers are up to.
542840	550760	But I can tell that you're worried. You're asking if this powerful AI follows Asimov's three laws of artificial intelligence. A good question.
550760	560440	All I can say is that during the robot apocalypse, I think vidIQ will be on the side of humanity. But how much can this monthly subscription possibly cost?
560440	567880	How much can a weapon of such power break the bank? Can you even put a price on an AI rivaling God themselves?
567880	579720	Well the bigwigs over at vidIQ HQ said $49 a month, but that wasn't good enough for me. So engaging my exquisite negotiation skills and some articulate ransom notes,
579720	590600	I have brought the price of their first month down by nearly 99%. So now you lovely people can venture onto YouTube with vidIQ for just $1 for their first month.
590600	603880	Yes, $1. Nearly 99% off. That's like buying a nondescript certain YouTuber's Tesla for $500. It's like reducing a life sentence for ransom to 6 months,
603880	612360	which would be great in this instance. It's Rishi Sunak reduced to just his thumb and leading the nation like he does now. I don't know about you,
612360	619560	but a thumb seems like a very electable option to me. If this proposition interests you, click the link in the description below
619560	628200	to subscribe to vidIQ for $1 for the first month, see how you like it. It might just change your game. Back to the video.
641960	648600	Allow me to introduce you to a man that you may not have heard of. This champ is called Les Crane, and in the 1960s he had a somewhat
648600	654360	popular late night program fittingly called The Les Crane Show. In an attempt to compete with other programs at the time,
654360	660120	they introduced a format which involved a shotgun microphone and members of the audience, whom he would proceed to grill on a multitude of
660120	664520	affairs, including socially sensitive topics of that time, such as homosexuality.
664520	673640	I have to differ with you, I have to argue with you on that one point there, because there are some homosexuals who are that way because of either
673640	682520	environment or because of a background that has caused them to go that route. Now, that doesn't mean that all homosexuals are sick people.
682520	689520	But not through, it's not something that happens through seduction or anything like that, the background is just that they grew up in a society,
689520	696680	and they found the existing heterosexual norms, not to their liking, whether it was the way they perceived their own parental relationships.
697160	702880	On one episode, he had hosted a debate with Lee Harvey Oswald's mother on the topic of her son's guilt, which was concluded with an
702920	707920	editorial recap from Mel Brooks of all people, but unfortunately, I couldn't retrieve any footage of such.
707920	714720	By all means, Les Crane was perceived as a vigorous, yet reasoned interviewer, and although the tabloid label was retroactively applied to his show,
714720	719000	not too long after followed what many believe was a more fitting prototype for the genre.
720000	745200	This is Joe Pine, he was another 50s and 60s talk show host who garnered popularity on radio and TV for his often outspoken and opinionated demeanor.
745200	753280	However, in 1965, his own self-titled talk show went into wide syndication, these typically involved fiery discussions with highly controversial guests,
753280	758320	coloured by Pine's own racially progressive, yet otherwise socially conservative political positions.
758320	765680	These conversations would regularly escalate into shouting matches, and even physical aggression, with reports being that chairs would regularly be thrown,
765680	772440	and Pine would have to eject his guests live on TV. Although receiving criticism for his platforming of vicious and even dangerous individuals,
772480	776600	he continued to retain a steady viewership until the show's cessation a couple years later.
776600	784560	In the years following, a number of hosts utilised similar blueprints for their talk shows, but after the heights of the Vietnam War and hippie culture that were a catalyst for a lot of these broadcasts,
784560	790960	the genre maintained a middling profile that wasn't the source of great discourse, mostly carried by Phil Donahue and Dick Cavett,
790960	796280	both of whom were known for their slightly more dignified techniques, though not without their exceptional moments.
796280	802560	However, this began to change once more in the 1980s, with the emergence of shows that catered towards more controversial subjects
802560	806200	that regularly resulted in conflicts between the guests and the hosts.
806200	807280	Go ahead and talk.
807280	807960	So shut up.
807960	809560	No, no, you shut up.
809560	810320	So shut up.
810320	811600	Sit down.
811600	812440	Sit down.
812440	814040	You had your chance of fame.
814040	815720	You had your chance of fame.
815720	816520	Sit down.
816520	817720	You had your chance of fame.
817720	818720	So look out.
818720	819720	Come on.
819720	820720	Come on.
820720	821720	Come on.
821720	822720	Come on.
822720	823720	Come on.
823720	824720	Come on.
824720	825720	Come on.
825720	826720	Come on.
826720	827720	Come on.
827720	833120	Probably the most famous example of this is Jerry Springer, the syndicated show named after its host.
833120	838480	Springer, a former lawyer and civic official, had initially conceived the show as a forum for political debate,
838480	843040	but after a few unsuccessful seasons, Springer and his new producer overhauled this concept,
843040	847360	and decided to focus on more personal issues with members of the public as their guests,
847360	852080	complemented by scripted sequences that would regularly escalate into physical confrontation,
852080	855040	sort of like Oprah meets WWE.
855040	860800	It clearly took a few notes from Joe Pine's show, while replacing the political content with more sociological matters.
860800	865120	Although the scripted sequences would eventually be scrapped, the topics were similarly contentious,
865120	868320	and were still the source of numerous controversies over the years that followed.
868320	872800	However, the success spoke for itself, and it wasn't long before the genre was more popular than ever,
872800	878000	featuring multiple syndicated shows with different hosts and international producers taking an interest as well.
878000	881840	Probably the most famous overseas example in the UK is The Jeremy Carr Show,
881840	886880	which ran for a total of 17 seasons, and was no less frenzied than its American contemporaries.
886880	893200	There! Listen! Look, I'm a boyfriend! Oh, don't worry about you!
893200	897600	You didn't mean it! I was with you all the time! Everyone's seen you all the time!
897600	899600	Keep going! I'm with you!
899600	904880	Oh, shut up, me!
904880	906000	So there we go!
906000	911520	Nonetheless, in spite of these ratings, the controversies are no less troubling for certain viewers, and even businesses.
911520	916000	As entertaining as conflict can be, many hosts played a role that could be perceived as provocative,
916000	921680	and as a person who is also trying to present themselves as an arbiter, that seemed a somewhat compromising problem.
921680	925840	The audience also often didn't help, seeming more like citizens in a Roman Colosseum,
925840	929200	ready to watch whatever gladiatorial combat was about to transpire.
929200	933840	Producers also participated by purposefully choosing topics that would garner the most views,
933840	937760	but at the same time, could also cause the most damage to the people actually involved.
937760	942640	Anyone who's familiar with conflict resolution knows the last thing you need is a large mob egging you on,
942640	947360	and therefore this sort of TV, although entertaining for some, was deeply discomforting for others.
947360	951280	A lot of these shows have been taken off air since, some the result of host fatigue,
951280	955280	some the result of TV scandals, and some the result of actual deaths.
955280	959040	Many of these shows also employed methods that were questionable in their authority.
959040	963120	A polygraph or lie detector, for example, is always a popular piece of equipment.
963120	968560	Its accuracy, however, is never guaranteed, yet its word was treated like gospel on all of these programs.
968560	973680	In the case of The Jeremy Carr Show, it was taken off the air after a guest who was known to have suffered from depression,
973680	979200	took his own life following his appearance and failure of a polygraph, of which Carr persistently insulted his guest,
979200	985200	and branded him a serial liar, of which the coroner concluded could well have contributed to his untimely death.
985200	988960	With The Revelation, there were probably other people who suffered the same fate as well.
988960	993760	I'd like to say that it was a sudden moral consciousness that kicked in the demise of many of these shows,
993760	998080	but I think it became apparent to producers and studios that these shows were liabilities,
998080	1002080	and that if they continued to utilise techniques that provoked their guests in such a way,
1002080	1005280	they could easily be facing some very serious lawsuits.
1005280	1012320	So over the 21st century, these shows have slowly faded into re-run rotation, but what could have taken its place?
1014160	1017920	Well, this is where Dr. Phil makes his grand entrance.
1021920	1026240	When he arrived on the scene in 2002, this sort of content was just passing its peak,
1026240	1028160	but still pulling significant ratings.
1028160	1032560	The market was pretty saturated, and there were more than enough talk show hosts for viewers to choose from.
1032560	1038160	The only real thing he had going for him on paper was his qualifications, and the backing of the behemoth that was Oprah.
1038160	1042320	However, he'd need more than that for the sort of longevity that she had enjoyed.
1042320	1044400	What would he do to ensure that?
1044400	1047440	Well, let me introduce you to Dr. Phil.
1047440	1063200	The year now is 2022, if my upload schedule is intact, and Dr. Phil has been up and running for 20 seasons.
1063200	1068640	It has outlasted nearly every tabloid talk show, a majority of normal talk shows, including Oprah,
1068640	1070560	and still pulls significant viewership.
1071160	1073040	He must have done something right.
1073440	1076360	You call people trailer trash or rednecks.
1076360	1076960	I have.
1077240	1080440	Okay, 90% of people are stupid.
1081440	1085440	There should be a law passed against stupid people.
1087740	1089760	Well, you better hope that isn't true.
1089960	1096200	From the off, Dr. Phil seemed to set himself apart from the competition, particularly in his approach to how he treated guests.
1096200	1099720	I think many hosts, even the ones that were probably more sensitive than most,
1099720	1105000	didn't have the human background to navigate the complex issues that many of these shows often sought to tackle.
1105020	1107480	Now, McGraw wasn't a full time psychologist.
1107480	1109920	As we know, he was a bit of a jack of all trades,
1109920	1115560	but his educational background in clinical psychology and at least some degree of practical experience made him a much
1115560	1119840	better fit for the moderating position that such an individual should typically occupy.
1120320	1128060	You also said women are really emotional, and men are logical, and I got the sense,
1128100	1129980	and I'm just asked you tell me what you think.
1129980	1134140	I'm not trying to I just want to know where you come down on it.
1134700	1138780	You said that is, though logic is at this level,
1138780	1143060	and emotion is at a lesser level of functioning.
1143060	1145380	Is that how you think he feels?
1145740	1150740	Psychology isn't just about knowing all these behavioral terms or knowing how to approach them.
1150740	1153060	Honestly, that would make pretty dry TV.
1153100	1159340	A lot of the art is in being able to deconstruct people's behavior and language to reach the core of how they're feeling.
1159380	1164420	The truth is, a lot of people don't say how they're feeling, particularly in these situations when their behaviors or
1164420	1165660	beliefs may be challenged.
1165660	1172060	It's a very interpretive job and requires picking out certain details that you may typically overlook in everyday conversation.
1172100	1174180	Now, I'm sure Dr Phil has his own style.
1174200	1177620	However, when the show started, he definitely demonstrated this ability,
1177640	1182220	and this often allowed him to connect with his guests more successfully than others from around his time.
1182460	1184300	And you feel guilty about this, don't you?
1185060	1187420	You feel guilty about where she is and what she's doing?
1187420	1187860	Yes.
1188140	1188700	Do you?
1189900	1192540	Because you guys say we're kind of blaming ourselves for this.
1193060	1195220	Have you intended to sabotage your daughter?
1195240	1195580	No.
1195700	1197300	Have you intended to make her stubborn?
1197340	1197660	No.
1197740	1198620	Non-compliant?
1198620	1198860	No.
1198860	1200900	Disobedient, rebellious.
1201340	1203020	So we need to put blame out of this.
1203020	1205500	Parents don't need to be feeling blame about this.
1205780	1211780	What you need to be thinking about here is that you have a responsibility for what's happened.
1211940	1217340	Dr Phil took a familiar formula, the fact that one or more people had a problem, the problem affected their daily life,
1217340	1218500	and they wish to address it.
1218580	1222900	Now, when you present this scenario to a majority of tabloid talk show hosts or their producers,
1222900	1225780	the question will be, how can we generate the most drama?
1225780	1230660	The approach that Dr Phil appears to take is more related to how can this problem be addressed?
1230700	1233900	And for many, there's a great satisfaction within problem resolution.
1233940	1237940	Other talk show hosts presented talking about your problems as being intimidating,
1237940	1240700	and certainly didn't really inspire people to seek out help.
1240700	1245540	And to be fair to Dr Phil, studies have shown that viewers of his shows are more likely to do just that,
1245540	1247820	and that's really nothing to turn your nose up at.
1247860	1252220	When dealing with certain disputes, he didn't seem to be insensitive to the human facts of play.
1252260	1254780	The human factors are what made Dr Phil appealing.
1254820	1258940	One of the skills to what his show does is one that I describe as extraction.
1258980	1262380	A lot of the time, Dr Phil would be presented with a specific situation,
1262380	1266460	one that on the surface could be rather niche and certainly not applicable to you or I.
1266500	1269060	Everyone has their own unique situations and challenges,
1269060	1272820	but a lot of the time they can also be rooted in general struggles that can affect anyone,
1272860	1278500	and by being able to focus on that, he could connect with audience members who may be emotionally moved by hearing such struggles.
1278540	1280380	This is something he's referenced in interviews,
1280380	1284540	and although some would justifiably find it a bit objectifying towards his guests,
1284580	1286940	it's also definitely the source of some success.
1288020	1295220	What I'm recommending is empirically supported in the psychological and psychiatric literature,
1295940	1302020	and I don't diagnose people, and I say very clearly, I can't diagnose you here.
1302060	1305660	I would have to complete a lot more interview than I have time to do.
1305700	1308740	I would have to do a battery of psychometric tests.
1308780	1312940	I'd probably have to do a brain workup and some lab work, and I can't do that here.
1312980	1317900	Now, in the short list of my considerations, if I was doing it, might be the following,
1317940	1320820	but these are things you're going to check out when you leave here.
1320900	1327260	And so they look at that and say, you know what, I think this guy's checking all the boxes.
1327300	1334340	Yeah. Well, so it just seems from that explanation that what you're doing is more for everybody else than for the person sitting in that chair, maybe.
1334380	1336140	They're teaching tools.
1336180	1337460	Everybody there is a teaching tool.
1337500	1339700	If I'm talking to you, it's a trade-off.
1339740	1344820	You get up close and personal focus and lots of resources,
1344820	1350740	because I have a blue ribbon advisory board with the top minds from the top learning centers in the country.
1350780	1354740	I do think it can help to put individuals more in touch with their own mental health,
1354780	1359180	with mind to the fact that such information should be handled carefully, which will put a pin in for now.
1359220	1368620	Did it never occur to you that, you know what, I'm putting myself first and my need to vent and my need to explode.
1368660	1371580	I'm putting that ahead of my children's best interest.
1371620	1372740	He yells at me too.
1372780	1373940	You don't get it.
1374020	1377380	I hope all of you at home get it, but you don't get it.
1377420	1381180	The angle that Dr. Phil adopts is also really important for audience retention.
1381220	1385820	There are lots of causes for people's mistakes and misdeeds, some of which we'll never understand.
1385860	1389300	However, Dr. Phil's focus on personal responsibility is universal.
1389340	1392780	I wholeheartedly believe good people can do bad things and learn from them.
1392820	1396660	At the same time, the only way to properly grow is to accept responsibility,
1396700	1402700	because if you assign all rationale for your behavior to external circumstances, you're admitting you don't have control over your actions.
1402700	1406580	Personal responsibility is the driving force for change, and by focusing on that,
1406620	1411500	Dr. Phil ensures that his show has the ability to find the solution within the problems presented.
1411540	1417380	In discussing people's specific problems, McGraw always managed to approach it from a perspective that gave it mass appeal,
1417420	1422300	retaining its educational grounding, while still speaking directly to the guests.
1422340	1424140	It was accessible, yet challenging.
1424180	1428380	I don't doubt it has probably helped a fair few people in not just understanding themselves,
1428380	1433980	but possibly being more empathetic to those around them, and impossibly recognizing those same signs.
1434020	1440900	Dr. Phil's demeanor also aids viewers in how they may feel morally about watching content that could typically leave vulnerable individuals
1440940	1442900	somewhat exposed in the eye of the media.
1442940	1450260	As much as gladiatorial combat enthralls those who desire it, there's always the question of the cost to those brave warriors who put themselves out there.
1450300	1455340	The Dr. Phil show presented discussion on these matters as if they were the first step to getting genuine help,
1455340	1461100	and therefore, viewers could feel more at ease believing that they weren't necessarily contributing to a harmful practice.
1461140	1465020	A lot of guests seemed to be in a better place after a discussion with Dr. Phil,
1465060	1471340	and whereas other tabloid talk show hosts almost focused on escalation, the art of Dr. Phil seemed to be de-escalation.
1471380	1477100	Each reaches some sort of conclusion, but the latter seems more mutually favorable in the long term.
1477140	1481420	I think in this case, Dr. Phil carved out an industry niche like very few others,
1481460	1486380	the show that took a genre nearly done to death and subverted it, and started its own trend,
1486420	1492460	this being what some branded as self-help TV, a more conscious way to approach issues that have previously been treated with apathy,
1492460	1494780	and even provocation on mainstream television.
1495180	1499260	It's clear that Dr. Phil saw himself less as a therapist and more as a moderator,
1499300	1504700	and wished to present himself as the reasonable voice within often two very strongly contrasting ones,
1504740	1511220	and for many viewers, they perceived him as just that, and tuned in to hear that voice discuss affairs that may hit close to home.
1511580	1515820	And as one of the pioneers of this new movement, it was only upwards from there.
1516220	1517980	But was there something more at stake?
1541420	1552060	One of the common appraisals of Dr. Phil is that he was clearly an intelligent guy,
1552100	1553460	and there was little doubt about that.
1553500	1557140	The dude knew how to present a TV show, and as the ratings followed suit,
1557140	1561020	he enjoyed success that even rivaled his superiors, and over the coming decades,
1561020	1563380	he would only grow his influence as a cultural icon.
1563460	1568780	At first, many viewers did consider him of the more academic cloth, particularly with his background and experience.
1568860	1572540	However, professional psychologists seldom have illustrious TV careers,
1572540	1576060	because the topic is often at odds with a lot of the principles of entertainment.
1576100	1581940	I think McGraw identified this pretty quickly, and in interviews, he didn't tie himself too closely to the occupation,
1581980	1586380	more emphasizing his nature to inform people to go and receive proper help.
1586780	1590500	A lot of individuals might speculate on how Dr. Phil evolved over the years.
1590500	1593740	A lot of TV shows tend to change, and when discussing talk shows,
1593740	1596140	they often evolved to their structure to stay relevant,
1596140	1599980	and even somewhat acceptable within the ever-adjusting moral compass of the viewers.
1600020	1601740	Dr. Phil was different in this sense.
1601740	1604180	He maintained a lot of consistency with his style.
1604220	1607940	However, what I think changed was how it was presented and perceived by others around it.
1607980	1611180	Indeed, as that style garnered popularity in the mainstream industry,
1611180	1615260	he found a new status as a bit of an oracle on affairs affecting the world in general,
1615260	1619540	and one that placed him in a rather unique position, but posed a few challenges of their own.
1619580	1621740	However, the doctor here responded accordingly.
1622260	1631180	I do believe that there comes a moment in time where all things wrong can be made right.
1632260	1636380	But if we're gonna do this, we're gonna do this my way.
1637060	1642140	In 2006, McGraw chose not to renew his license to practice psychology professionally in Texas.
1642180	1644940	Some may ask whether this affected his ability to run his show.
1644940	1647260	However, in California, where said show was based,
1647260	1650380	their respective Board of Psychology reported to have agreed that Dr.
1650380	1655220	Phil does not actually practice psychology on his show and therefore does not require a license.
1655220	1656820	Some have questioned why he did this,
1656820	1660140	and my personal opinion holds that if he didn't actually need it for his show,
1660140	1662740	then it likely became a liability in his eyes.
1662780	1666380	Being a practicing psychologist obviously comes with certain responsibilities,
1666380	1668620	and if he or his show was found to have breached them,
1668660	1671860	even if he wasn't presenting himself in a psychological capacity,
1671900	1674620	then he could have landed himself in some serious shit,
1674660	1679500	which would have generated a lot more controversy than him just opting not to renew his license.
1689380	1693140	A lot of people found this out during Britney Spears' life crisis in 2008.
1693180	1694940	During a stint where she had been hospitalized,
1694940	1697980	her parents, clearly eager to support her, invited Dr.
1697980	1701180	Phil to her bedside, an invitation which he readily accepted.
1701220	1702300	However, after his visit,
1702300	1704540	Dr. Phil decided to issue a public statement,
1704540	1708180	expressing an urgency for the troubled pop star to receive medical support.
1708220	1710540	This was met with disappointment from Spears' parents,
1710540	1714420	who expressed that McGraw had violated their trust by issuing a public statement,
1714420	1718740	and it was even alleged that a complaint had been filed to the Board of Psychology that McGraw had practiced
1718740	1720340	psychology without a license.
1720340	1723940	Now, there are a few more layers to this than a lot of press reported at the time.
1723940	1729900	Dr. Phil did actually know Britney's parents in a personal capacity and claimed to have attended the hospital as a friend,
1729900	1731100	and not a therapist.
1731100	1735620	Nonetheless, it still engendered a lot of discourse about his responsibility as a public figure,
1735620	1738260	and his outspoken reputation on mental health,
1738260	1742300	with many asking the question of whether he had actually breached his responsibility as a confidant.
1742300	1744980	Dr. Phil did actually issue a response to this on his website,
1744980	1749980	where he clarified he did not practice psychology and had no intent to practice it in the foreseeable future.
1749980	1754820	It definitely showcased the dichotomy with how many audience members viewed him and how he viewed himself,
1754820	1756100	and in spite of these statements,
1756100	1759180	many still held him as an expert in his respective field,
1759180	1761420	and to be fair, it's not like he disagreed.
1761420	1766980	In his statement, he still drew attention to the fact that he had decades of experience and a PhD to show for it.
1766980	1768900	He was still a doctor after all.
1768900	1772380	Although Dr. Phil didn't seem to change in his approach towards guests,
1772380	1776500	not too long after dropping his license, McGraw seemed to expand his franchise.
1776500	1780980	Many continued to utilize the notion of expert advice, including the show The Doctors,
1780980	1784380	which, although not featuring McGraw, was created and produced by him.
1784380	1788100	The Doctors is another talk show that leans more into the general medical issues,
1788100	1792540	and was relatively successful, being canceled in 2022 after 14 seasons.
1792540	1795220	Another recent show, House Calls with Dr. Phil,
1795220	1800140	once more uses a trope more associated with traditional doctors who may be called to a patient's abode,
1800140	1804620	though looking at the state of healthcare nowadays, I'm surprised we didn't get phone calls with Dr. Phil.
1804620	1806820	He also launched the company Doctor on Demand,
1806820	1810700	which allowed individuals to schedule appointments with medical and psychological professionals.
1810700	1814860	I'll say that it's a good thing he was providing a platform for more licensed experts,
1814900	1819980	but I also think it's indicative of the fact that he still enjoyed his status and wanted to make the most of it.
1819980	1823340	The truth was, whether he felt like a practicing psychologist or not,
1823340	1825300	it was clear how other people viewed him.
1825300	1831540	The other reason why there aren't a lot of TV figures in the realm of Dr. Phil's is because of the sensitivity of humans themselves,
1831540	1833300	and the trouble that can cause.
1833300	1835460	Dr. Phil was no stranger to that either.
1835460	1839420	In fact, even his most successful, he could be facing multiple lawsuits,
1839420	1843420	mostly from disgruntled guests who were unhappy with their portrayal of the show.
1843420	1846380	A large majority of these lawsuits were fairly quickly dismissed,
1846380	1849300	with judges finding the coverage provided by Dr. Phil was fair,
1849300	1852340	and McGraw's language being protected under the First Amendment.
1852340	1855340	Dr. Phil occupied this near bulletproof position,
1855340	1858260	where his words were viewed as holding a significant amount of weight,
1858260	1864100	yet could never officially bear that much responsibility as he operated and presented the show as a talk show host.
1864100	1865700	He may not have changed his method,
1865700	1871220	but he definitely shifted his image towards a more business oriented model that provided him with more protection.
1871220	1875260	He would regularly make TV appearances and stage interventions with other celebrities,
1875260	1877740	ordinary people, or washed up TV stars.
1877740	1883740	Obtaining this Messiah-like status amongst many is the guy who would fly in and rescue you from your lowest points,
1883740	1885500	or give you a good pep talk at least.
1885500	1888660	As the halfway point between medical professional and entertainer,
1888660	1894100	Dr. Phil had occupied a position in the media that enabled him to develop his brand with extensive influence,
1894100	1897540	while maintaining an audience who respected his approach to sensitive matters.
1897580	1902420	It was a devastating combination, and it seemed like there was very little that could undo it.
1902420	1909220	However, would the necessity to occupy two quite conflicting positions pose a challenge as the media landscape evolved?
1909700	1911620	Well, let's find out.
1911620	1925780	Hey, Dr. Phil here.
1925780	1929860	I'm backstage getting ready to do the show, which is where you're used to seeing me.
1929860	1934860	But in the virtual world of computer games, I can be somebody completely different.
1935860	1944860	I can be super mortal Phil, defender of my countrymen, and a super stud who gets to have cool hair while playing.
1944860	1952860	And in this virtual world, I'm agile, powerful, and I never have to do what my wife says.
1952860	1957860	As known to the start, this sort of content has mostly found its footing within the airwaves of mainstream television,
1957860	1961860	and throughout most of its early lifespan, there was nothing that could really change that.
1961860	1967860	However, over time, with the increasing influence of social media, opportunities presented themselves for TV networks to advertise,
1967860	1969860	and possibly garner new viewers.
1969860	1976860	It also served as an archive for viewers who may have missed the show, or wanted to rewatch popular clips without too much inconvenience.
1976860	1983860	With this in mind, it's not hard to see why the Dr. Phil show was one of the earlier TV shows to serve a channel on the budding website known as YouTube.
1983860	1987860	A platform like YouTube provided the perfect opportunity for success.
1987860	1992860	At its inception, it only really allowed for shorter clips, which I know is hard to actually remember,
1992860	1999860	but for a TV show like Dr. Phil, this meant that snippets of the show could be put online to hopefully reel new audience members in.
1999860	2003860	However, at that time, YouTube was much more oriented towards homegrown content,
2003860	2008860	and although the Dr. Phil producers tried their best by publishing multiple interviews with famous names,
2008860	2014860	using clips often addressing trending topics, and even having McGraw respond to comments in his own YouTube series,
2014860	2017860	nothing ever quite went viral like they may have hoped.
2017860	2022860	This did not deter them though, and over the years, they continued to upload content that cultivated an audience,
2022860	2027860	and as YouTube became more palatable to mainstream sources who were able to upload high definition content,
2027860	2034860	and with users becoming more intrigued by subjects of Dr. Phil's episodes, the view count seemed to begin to pick up significantly.
2034860	2040860	This was definitely aided by the rise of the early commentary genre that specialised in talking about other people,
2040860	2043860	particularly those who may have been slightly more eccentric than the average Joe.
2044860	2045860	It certainly paid off.
2045860	2050860	It's just so fascinating when something catches like that girl. What is her name? The catch me outside girl.
2050860	2055860	Uh, Danielle Bregoli or something? Something like that, yeah.
2055860	2058860	Cause I didn't know her as the catch me outside girl.
2059860	2064860	Another emerging trend was the nature for the internet to bestow meme status onto people.
2064860	2070860	Now, this had its roots in something quite usual, our culture has always enjoyed making overnight sensations of relatively unknown figures.
2070860	2074860	How the internet certainly made this easier, targeting people who stood out from the crowd,
2074860	2077860	whether that be due to their behaviour or just their appearance.
2077860	2084860	Now, in many ways, this could be quite fortuitous for someone like Dr. Phil, whose content was built on dealing with often challenging personas,
2084860	2091860	but often to acquire such a status, a person needs to be a perfect storm of characteristics that hasn't been seen elsewhere,
2091860	2094860	and those sorts of people are a rare breed.
2094860	2099860	With that in mind, I'd like to introduce you to someone by the name of Danielle Bregoli.
2099860	2104860	I'm pretty violent. I'm with her in the face cause she wouldn't get out of my face.
2104860	2108860	Either I'm breaking down her door or she's breaking down my door.
2108860	2111860	I don't stop till I start seeing dents in a door.
2111860	2117860	Danielle Bregoli was like many Dr. Phil guests, a troubled youth who possess serious behavioral issues,
2117860	2121860	and externalize them in a way that many youngsters have a tendency to do.
2121860	2127860	Dr. Phil often showcased troubled teens on his show, and on paper, the premise of her appearance was not exceptional.
2127860	2132860	However, paper can only account for so many variables, and when she took the stage in early 2016,
2132860	2136860	it was clear that this was not going to be any ordinary episode.
2136860	2140860	I ain't gonna lie, there's no reason to lie, everybody know already, like...
2140860	2148860	What do you say to yourself that gives you the right to take somebody else's car?
2148860	2153860	You're talking about sliding? F*** you mean? That's what makes me want to take the next bitch car.
2153860	2157860	What now? I'm sorry I didn't get that. Are you speaking English?
2157860	2162860	A lot of the youths that Dr. Phil addressed on the show definitely conformed to a certain mold.
2162860	2166860	It was clear they were projecting aspects of culture they idolized onto themselves,
2166860	2171860	and therefore that behavior, although sometimes extremely challenging, was not unfamiliar.
2171860	2178860	Danielle Bregoli seemed to bring her own personal flavor to the role, and her extremely abrasive attitude also played into that.
2178860	2182860	Dr. Phil in this case played the usual role of mediator attempting to reason with her,
2182860	2185860	but sometimes people just aren't there to be reasoned with,
2185860	2188860	and her relationship with the audience only inflamed that.
2188860	2191860	Soon Danielle was turning on everyone within the vicinity,
2191860	2194860	making threats that didn't seem quite as threatening as they could be.
2194860	2198860	Did you say the hoes are laughing?
2198860	2199860	Yep.
2199860	2201860	So the audience are a bunch of hoes.
2201860	2202860	Yep.
2206860	2209860	Catch me outside, how bout dat?
2209860	2211860	Catch me outside, how bout dat?
2211860	2215860	Catch you outside, what does that mean?
2215860	2217860	What'd I just say?
2217860	2219860	At first it didn't pick up too many views,
2219860	2225860	but over time it garnered traction, and eventually the famous quote at the end of the video became noteworthy to many online observers.
2225860	2228860	It wasn't long until their antics were provided international coverage,
2228860	2233860	and memes started cropping up all over social media that made a mockery out of her language and demeanor,
2233860	2235860	amassing online notoriety.
2235860	2239860	Although the show was instrumental in the facilitation of this popularity,
2239860	2242860	Dr. Phil wasn't really at the center of this discourse,
2242860	2245860	only one person really mattered, and that was Bregoli.
2245860	2247860	However, she definitely started something online,
2247860	2252860	and not too long after, a new genre of respiring commentators presented itself.
2252860	2254860	Catch me outside, how bout dat?
2254860	2258860	Bro, I give up on these kids nowadays, dude. I'm so done with these fucking kids.
2258860	2260860	This is Trigga Trove.
2260860	2264860	He was one of the first creators to pick up on the fascination with many Dr. Phil guests,
2264860	2267860	particularly those that appealed to certain outlandish stereotypes.
2268860	2270860	As Daniel Bregoli began to garner online attention,
2270860	2272860	the then budding creator released a video titled,
2272860	2275860	The Catch Me Outside, How Bout Dat Girl Roast,
2275860	2276860	and the rest was history.
2276860	2278860	Yeah, I know where the car at.
2280860	2281860	You know where the car at?
2281860	2283860	Did you go to fifth grade?
2283860	2285860	Did you go to fifth grade?
2285860	2286860	Did you go to fifth grade?
2286860	2288860	Fifth grade? Fifth grade?
2288860	2291860	God damn, Dr. Phil, you straight roasted her ass.
2291860	2292860	Did you go to fifth grade?
2292860	2295860	Dr. Phil, more like doctor, you gotta fucking chill.
2295860	2298860	The then less than 2,000 subscriber creator had struck gold,
2298860	2301860	and he only continued in that direction for the following year.
2301860	2304860	That is childish and immature behaviour.
2304860	2306860	Now I get to leave.
2306860	2307860	Yes, you do.
2307860	2308860	No.
2308860	2310860	Don't let the door hit you in the ass.
2310860	2313860	Oh my God, what a savage.
2313860	2316860	I didn't realise Dr. Phil was such a gangster.
2316860	2320860	Dozens of Dr. Phil videos became the focus of online content,
2320860	2321860	reaching more audiences than ever,
2321860	2323860	and the producers, as they always have been,
2323860	2325860	were sure to cash in on this new opportunity,
2325860	2328860	publishing more content on the platform than they ever had before.
2328860	2330860	Today on an all new Dr. Phil.
2330860	2332860	You're ugly, you're disgusting,
2332860	2334860	I'm gonna kill you, give me $200.
2334860	2338860	Damn, Dr. Phil's a stone cold savage.
2338860	2340860	I didn't know Dr. Phil would come after you like that.
2340860	2342860	I mean, he did try and break into my house one time.
2342860	2344860	I want the money.
2344860	2348860	I'll raise enough hell till you give in and give it to me.
2351860	2353860	What do you think of me now?
2356860	2358860	Yes, Dr. Phil, get it!
2358860	2361860	It seems this genre of content had given Dr. Phil a fresh wind,
2361860	2364860	a relevance amongst a new generation of viewers who wanted to engage in that content.
2364860	2369860	One of the greatest drawbacks to mainstream television is that many believe it doesn't appeal to younger people,
2369860	2372860	and at the end of the day, they're the future older people.
2372860	2376860	Yet less than half a year after Danielle Bregoli's first appearance,
2376860	2381860	Dr. Phil enjoyed over 150 consecutive weeks at the top of the syndicated TV ratings,
2381860	2385860	beating out Maury, Wendy Williams, and yes, Ellen.
2385860	2389860	With this in mind, it's clear that Dr. Phil had captured the attention of a new cohort of viewers,
2389860	2394860	and it wasn't long until he signed another contract extending the series until 2023.
2394860	2397860	Everything was going right.
2397860	2406860	Are you one of those parents who uses the TV as a babysitter? Next, a mom who can't...
2409860	2414860	With the help of social media, Dr. Phil seemed to have pulled off one of the more impressive feats in television.
2414860	2418860	He managed to make his content relevant to a new set of people, and it seemed they weren't going anywhere.
2418860	2422860	He subsequently leaned into this reputation, appearing on a variety of internet shows,
2422860	2426860	and even co-hosting PewDiePie's popular meme review series.
2426860	2428860	Take it away, doctor.
2428860	2432860	Hey everyone, it's Dr. Phil here, and I'm hosting Meme Review.
2432860	2436860	It seems his stoic, tough love style had become beloved by a fresh demographic,
2436860	2439860	all of whom had a platform to access this content freely.
2439860	2445860	However, social media can go two ways, and as much as they may love you one day, they may hate you the next.
2445860	2448860	Internet culture moves quickly, even more quickly these days in fact,
2448860	2453860	and about as soon as Dr. Phil was popularized by the content he and others post online,
2453860	2457860	more critical eyes were drawn towards him, finding a lot beneath the surface.
2457860	2463860	It would be no surprise, given everything said thus far, that Dr. Phil wasn't without his enemies or his critics.
2463860	2468860	In fact, he has been subject to severe criticism from medical professionals since the inception of his show.
2468860	2473860	That can't be a surprise, really, given that his technique isn't actually one that's favored by most working in that profession.
2473860	2480860	Every parent should know the warning signs. For the most violent of criminals, there are 14 traits of serial killers.
2480860	2487860	Now meet parents terrified of their own young son who has 9 of the 14 traits.
2487860	2491860	Criticism of Dr. Phil has been present since the show's launch in 2002.
2491860	2496860	He was condemned by the National Alliance on Mental Illness after McGraw delivered a scathing public psychological analysis
2496860	2501860	of a 9-year-old in 2004, with academic commentary on his techniques not exactly changing since.
2501860	2506860	However, these narratives never had much impact because the majority of academics were on the fringe of popular culture at least,
2506860	2510860	with many operating strictly within their fields. Ten different psychological boards could condemn you,
2510860	2513860	and it wouldn't mean anything if they didn't receive any coverage.
2513860	2518860	So while Dr. Phil primarily occupied the realms of television, he was mostly immune to such commentary and controversy.
2518860	2524860	In spite of the numerous lawsuits and claims all the way up to 2017, you search Dr. Phil on the TV,
2524860	2529860	and the only result you'll find is the big man himself. However, this isn't quite the case with online search engines,
2529860	2534860	in particular YouTube, where Dr. Phil isn't the only person talking about Dr. Phil.
2534860	2540860	Yes, you see, whereas previously the closest that most academics could get to having a public platform would be an opinion piece
2540860	2546860	of the New York Times or an interview on MSNBC, there was now a whole website dedicated to allowing them to upload
2546860	2551860	their thoughts on their specialist subjects. Now, like with any learned commentator, the trick is to make sure the topics
2551860	2556860	you're talking about are somewhat relevant to the audience, and given that Dr. Phil was indeed very relevant,
2556860	2560860	many began to open up discourse on his methods, and their success, or lack thereof.
2560860	2565860	These took form of articles, YouTube videos, anything that gave an individual a way to express their feelings.
2565860	2571860	So if Phil McGraw says it's not therapy, and he's not practicing any way, what is it?
2571860	2576860	Kind of back to my original point, it's really just entertainment.
2576860	2583860	All the seriousness with an insane amount of sound effects and transitions and just editorial nonsense.
2583860	2589860	My whole life changed the day I met Jazz because she's the most spectacular woman I've ever met.
2589860	2594860	It's no wonder people forget these are real human beings, the editing turns it all into a cartoon.
2594860	2600860	Most of this began to circulate around the start of 2019. Funnily enough, this wasn't during any specific drama,
2600860	2605860	more likely a product of Dr. Phil inertia, and the fact that people were growing more critical of prominent media
2605860	2610860	figures in general. McGraw had always accepted that he was a bit of an outcast from the industry, but I do think these
2610860	2615860	criticisms were somewhat contradictory to a lot of public opinion that had definitely heralded him as this universal
2615860	2619860	problem solver, particularly that which questioned the general morals of the show.
2619860	2623860	What did Dr. Phil have to offer other than an interesting premise for its time?
2623860	2626860	Okay, it's good to meet you. Hi, it's nice to meet you too.
2626860	2631860	Now, tell me what you mean when you say you're the reincarnation.
2631860	2639860	Because Pocahontas was my 13th grade grandmother, but I'm sharing her soul in my body.
2639860	2644860	So you can feel her presence in you? Yeah.
2644860	2648860	It's difficult being any sort of public figure and dealing with issues that are often deeply personal.
2648860	2653860	You're handling sensitive information, and one of the drawbacks of Dr. Phil's show is that no matter how good he could
2653860	2657860	have hypothetically been, the program was still designed to bring about drama, even if he wasn't.
2657860	2662860	And people began to pick up on that. Television and therapy have always seemed somewhat opposed to each other.
2662860	2666860	Although it's important that there are people prepared to be open about their struggles to help others,
2666860	2671860	it's still a subject that needs to be handled with sensitivity and care, and given the fact that some of these people
2671860	2676860	were not even on the show by their own volition, particularly children who were likely brought on by their parents,
2676860	2682860	it's hard to see the benefit that was derived. Simply put, you wouldn't see this sort of drama in a private therapy room
2682860	2687860	because TV cameras and the presence of a large public audience always encourages people to act more defensive,
2687860	2689860	and even aggressive.
2689860	2694860	Now I have a career and I'm famous. That's what happens when you get famous, you cut people off.
2694860	2716860	Everyone's upset with it, maybe because you guys aren't relevant either, so you don't understand.
2716860	2720860	Some people began to ask, why is this TV at all? And I think it's a potent question.
2720860	2725860	Probably the easiest answer is simple, that being of entertainment, and obviously that's important as it drives
2725860	2730860	the core appeal of a lot of modern TV, having it can't be the only reason when there are other ethical queries
2730860	2735860	surrounding the subject. The Hunger Games is pretty entertaining for a lot of people, but there's also a reason why it's fictional.
2735860	2742860	Dr. Phil can showcase people at their weakest and most vulnerable, and although it's often used to drive home a positive message,
2742860	2747860	what sacrifice to a person's privacy and individual healing process is made to achieve that?
2747860	2754860	Sure, Dr. Phil raises awareness, but at what cost? A lot of people clearly had it in their head that there was some mutual benefit,
2754860	2760860	coming on Dr. Phil was meant to be helpful, but the only people it was guaranteed to benefit were some viewers and the show itself.
2760860	2766860	I think the audience's self-assurance that Dr. Phil offered some unique brand of assistance was really meant to mask the fact that people
2766860	2772860	love to watch a car crash. There's a reason why the most successful Dr. Phil videos are the ones with the most heated confrontations.
2772860	2778860	These videos all likely staying on YouTube for the rest of eternity, showing the behaviour of some extremely troubled people.
2778860	2784860	Sure, Dr. Phil was better than his trash TV contemporaries, but that didn't exactly make him a force for good,
2784860	2790860	and with his greater presence online, it also made it easier to reach with such criticisms, and many did just that.
2790860	2795860	So with all these different points in mind, both the positive and the negative, my question would be,
2795860	2799860	why would anyone believe that Phil McGraw knows something special?
2799860	2804860	Many began to wonder what Dr. Phil was offering his guests that couldn't be offered elsewhere.
2804860	2809860	Well, I suppose the one thing was that any sort of treatment was not cheap in a place like the United States,
2809860	2813860	and Dr. Phil did offer a space for that, at the price of a bit of TV time.
2813860	2819860	Additionally, the therapy doesn't end on the Dr. Phil show, many would attest that he provides help beyond their TV appearance,
2819860	2824860	and for the children who McGraw felt were facing the most significant challenges, they would have an all-expenses-paid trip
2824860	2828860	to Turnabout Ranch, that was designed to help put kids on the right path.
2828860	2833860	Dr. Phil did offer something different to everyone else, and just because a person doesn't derive benefit,
2833860	2839860	doesn't mean the formula in place can't help a majority of people, does it?
2845860	2850860	Okay, let's say the concept behind Dr. Phil is inherently flawed, there was no way that a show like this could possibly work
2850860	2853860	in favour of every guest because of how the public spotlight affects you.
2853860	2859860	It would be fair to question its status on the principal alone, but is it fair to tar the entire show with the critical brush?
2859860	2864860	The least that some would argue is that McGraw and the producers involved did their best to mitigate the negative impact
2864860	2867860	that may be drawn towards individuals who were involved with the show.
2868860	2876860	I'm not here to judge you, I'm here to help you. I'm here to help you.
2876860	2884860	I'm here to do what your husband should have done all along the way, and that is to lead you out of this quagmire and into the light.
2884860	2889860	Dr. Phil himself was often outspoken in making sure people knew the help an individual would be receiving,
2889860	2895860	and like a lot of shows, conducted segments that revisited former participants to assess how their lives had changed since then.
2895860	2896860	So how are you doing?
2896860	2901860	Doing good, I am four months clean and sober for everything.
2903860	2904860	So glad to hear that.
2904860	2912860	It just puts courage and strength, and finally love myself, because you helped me figure that out.
2912860	2915860	Like, being able to do that has changed my life.
2915860	2920860	It seemed that the consensus from a lot of guests was broadly positive, and that their appearance on Dr. Phil had prompted
2920860	2924860	many of them to begin turning their lives around. It likely made viewers feel good about themselves,
2924860	2930860	but as people began to dig, they realised that this outlook wasn't quite as universal as it was portrayed on TV,
2930860	2934860	with some even suggesting that there had been serious failures regarding the safeguarding of guests.
2934860	2939860	As noted, there have been several lawsuits and allegations that were published during the lifespan of the show,
2939860	2945860	but as always, the problem with these is that when they're isolated, they're typically not high-profile enough to attract attention from the public.
2945860	2949860	However, when they can all be lined up in one place, a much clearer pattern can be established,
2949860	2952860	and greater narratives can be expounded on the matter.
2952860	2957860	With Dr. Phil under the spotlight as a whole, and the online world making it easier to access such information,
2957860	2961860	it wasn't long until people began picking apart the show's wholesome veneer.
2961860	2966860	The first aspect to go under the microscope was how the show managed the handling of its guests on air.
2966860	2973860	Dr. Phil and the producers always made a point about the show being a safe space for an individual to speak openly about their trials and their trauma.
2973860	2977860	However, some have begun to question whether that was truly the case in the last few years,
2977860	2980860	or if chasing a story was more important to the people in question.
2981860	2985860	I must know why you and my step-sisters treat me with such contempt.
2985860	2990860	You know, I try to be kind and forgiving, but the nicer I am, the worse you treat me.
2990860	2997860	This is Shelley Duvall. A few decades ago, she was an A-list celebrity who had a successful and lucrative career in film and television.
2997860	3003860	However, in 2002, she retired from acting and decided to live a life away from the limelight, making very few public appearances.
3003860	3009860	Yet, in 2016, that changed, when she agreed to be interviewed by McGraw for an episode of Dr. Phil.
3009860	3012860	What followed next was... something else.
3012860	3021860	It's very confusing, very disturbing to me, because they started out with Ground Zero and Triple Zero.
3021860	3029860	It's like when a nun at some place tells you, you're almost Triple Zero, and she meant it!
3029860	3036860	And, anyway, everybody was already listening in on me, even from Santa Monica.
3036860	3041860	I should go without saying that what Duvall was experiencing was a serious episode of a mental breakdown,
3041860	3047860	and she was in a clearly compromised state, to which it would be questionable whether she could even understand what was happening in that moment.
3047860	3054860	Throughout the interview, McGraw continuously encourages and attempts to aid Duvall in finding help, for which Duvall seems incredibly reluctant.
3054860	3065860	I want to check everything out. I want to make sure that you're healthy, and that you're feeling right, thinking right, sleeping right, eating right.
3065860	3068860	Do you take any medication?
3068860	3077860	No. Will you quit trying to pin me with... She's a heavy drinker? She takes pills?
3077860	3081860	Sit in your head. Come on, I see the V at the top there.
3081860	3082860	Yeah, I got a bald head.
3082860	3083860	That's a goose.
3083860	3088860	You see, the reason I want to get you checked out is because...
3088860	3089860	They're not tourniquets.
3089860	3102860	If your hair is thinning, and you're feeling pain, I want to help you. I want to get you to some doctors that can really check you out.
3102860	3105860	It's a physical problem. Physical.
3105860	3106860	I want to check you out physically.
3106860	3110860	And I don't want any more B-Bites, because they threaten me, but I'm not afraid of them.
3111860	3117860	I'm not going to focus on this interview too much, but it caught the attention of some high profile figures, including Stanley Kubrick's daughter,
3117860	3122860	and actress Maya Farrow, who both criticised the broadcast of someone clearly at such a vulnerable point in their life.
3122860	3125860	I think, however, it was more indicative of the show.
3125860	3130860	Shelly, listen to me. Will you let me get you to some doctors?
3131860	3133860	I was a pretty girl. I was beautiful.
3133860	3140860	I was 1987 Entertainer of the Year for the Southern California Cable Television Association.
3140860	3142860	Will you let me get you to some doctors?
3142860	3144860	Not as a prisoner, you're not.
3144860	3147860	Of course not. You can come and go anytime you want.
3147860	3150860	What was wrong with the doctors I had?
3150860	3152860	We haven't seen doctors for a good while.
3152860	3155860	But I'd rather see my doctor than your doctor.
3155860	3158860	Well, but I've got some really good doctors.
3158860	3159860	You do?
3160860	3161860	Yeah. Can I fix this?
3161860	3167860	I don't know if McGraw is charging by the hour, but this interview almost seems too motivated to get Shelly help,
3167860	3171860	and I use the quotation marks there, because help is subjective depending on the person.
3171860	3174860	What might help one person isn't guaranteed to help another person.
3174860	3179860	Throughout the interview, Dr Phil seems determined to get Duval to this one centre in particular,
3179860	3183860	which ultimately fails because once she's there, Duval is not comfortable receiving help there,
3183860	3186860	and at the end of the episode, he reveals that they're supporting her at home anyway.
3186860	3190860	Dr Phil runs through a manual that dictates operations regardless of the individual,
3190860	3196860	it's manufactured to maintain those narratives, but what happens when that aspect is pushed to obsessive degrees?
3196860	3203860	There have been a couple of instances in the past where the producers of Dr Phil were accused of facilitating people's problems rather than helping them.
3203860	3207860	In 2008, a member of the Dr Phil team was caught paying towards a violent teen's bail,
3207860	3210860	and although they subsequently cancelled the story, let's be frank here,
3210860	3213860	it was no secret the lengths the show would go to to get a scoop.
3213860	3219860	Yet another high profile case seemed to take the biscuit, and it once again involved another public figure.
3219860	3224860	This is Todd Herzog, he was the victor of the 15th season of Survivor, set in China.
3224860	3231860	However, after his success, he had struggled with alcoholism, during which his mother had contacted Dr Phil for help with her son's problem.
3231860	3235860	However, when he turned up to the studio, he was intoxicated to the point of incomprehension.
3235860	3239860	McGraw was sure to bring attention to this and the serious danger he was in.
3239860	3249860	So yeah, I'm okay, because I didn't know this was happening right now.
3249860	3252860	You're not okay?
3252860	3253860	No.
3253860	3257860	You said you're okay, but you're not okay. You're not even almost okay.
3257860	3258860	No.
3258860	3259860	Do you know who I am?
3259860	3262860	Yeah, of course I know who you are.
3262860	3275860	You are here, because I wanted to talk to you, because in my opinion, you're killing yourself, man.
3275860	3283860	I want to get a fix on you right now, so I know what I'm dealing with. This is a breathalyzer.
3283860	3290860	I want you to blow into it really hard for five seconds when I tell you, so I can see where you are.
3290860	3295860	Once again, after a brief consultation, Dr Phil emphasizes how he's going to find him help, and to be fair,
3295860	3299860	in this case, it's probably not the wrong sort of help, and after receiving treatment,
3299860	3304860	Todd makes his appearance on the show as a sober individual and expresses his gratitude for the intervention.
3304860	3310860	However, a couple years later, in 2016, he appears on the show once more after relapsing.
3311860	3318860	At 2.30 this morning, you had a blood alcohol level of 0.432.
3320860	3321860	Yeah.
3322860	3323860	And?
3323860	3329860	One week squared is 0.601.
3330860	3332860	That's...
3332860	3333860	Death.
3333860	3334860	That's death.
3334860	3335860	That's death.
3335860	3339860	It's always somewhat tragic to see a person struggling so much on live TV.
3339860	3345860	However, in 2017, Herzog went public with the claim that his struggle had been orchestrated by the Dr Phil producers,
3345860	3349860	who planned a bottle of vodka in his dressing room during both interventions.
3349860	3354860	I show up to the studios, and I'm sober, I'm hurting a lot, and I'm shaking.
3354860	3358860	My dad was there, and I went and talked to him in his dressing room, and I was completely sober.
3358860	3366860	And then they pull me into my dressing room, and there was two liters of vodka and, like, some Red Bulls and orange juice and stuff like that.
3366860	3373860	You know, being unsupervised by my parents, I drank the entire bottle.
3375860	3377860	And then at some point, somebody gave me a Xanax.
3377860	3379860	They said, this will calm your nerves.
3379860	3385860	And so I had been drinking and took a Xanax, which I've never taken Xanax before in my life,
3386860	3390860	and I know that can be a deadly combination, so why it was given to me, I don't know.
3390860	3395860	I get that it's a television show, and that they want to show the pain that I'm in.
3395860	3400860	However, what would have happened if I died there, you know?
3400860	3404860	This seemed to paint a very different portrait than the one that was perceived,
3404860	3411860	and in both cases of Devana Herzog seemed to tell us something extremely different about the intent of McGraw and those around him.
3416860	3422860	The irony is that perfect television is often the moments that probably shouldn't even be there.
3422860	3427860	People want something that is raw and real, and often that can't happen naturally in front of a TV camera.
3427860	3429860	So when it does, it's all the more powerful.
3429860	3434860	In the case of Herzog and De Waal, what we saw were two people who were clearly suffering from something serious,
3434860	3437860	and its coverage, for many, was extremely riveting.
3437860	3441860	However, in both cases, it's fair to question how fair it truly was.
3442860	3445860	Is this going to be a murder? Are you going to murder me?
3445860	3450860	This looks deserted. Leave me alone. I don't want to be murdered.
3450860	3452860	We would never murder you.
3452860	3455860	You stop driving, and I'm going to have a cigarette.
3455860	3458860	Fire hazard area, no fire hazard area.
3458860	3463860	If you're smoke-enders, Patrick Reynolds warned me about you.
3463860	3468860	In the case of De Waal, trying to ship her off to some facility that may not have been suitable for her problems,
3468860	3472860	and in the case of Herzog, allegedly exploiting a vulnerability for drama.
3472860	3475860	And although I cannot comment for certain on the verity of the claim,
3475860	3479860	is it not suspicious that despite being surrounded by a full TV crew,
3479860	3481860	a family who probably didn't want him to consume alcohol,
3481860	3484860	and experts who were supposedly worried for his health,
3484860	3486860	that he still turned up drunk?
3486860	3489860	I understand if you can't completely control a person,
3489860	3492860	but if the safeguarding measures were up to scratch,
3492860	3495860	like producers had claimed in other interviews surrounding this matter,
3495860	3498860	there is no way he should have arrived at that studio intoxicated,
3498860	3500860	and yet it happened twice.
3500860	3503860	In both of these high-profile situations,
3503860	3507860	it seems the authenticity was merely a front for something more manufactured,
3507860	3511860	a conflict that wasn't necessary for the discourse that everyone seemed so concerned about,
3511860	3514860	but more so allowed producers to raise stakes in dramatic narratives
3514860	3518860	that emphasised the urgency of the situations that these guests found themselves in,
3518860	3522860	and to be honest, if McGraw hadn't landed himself in the controversy while consulting Britney,
3522860	3525860	the producers may well have done a similar thing with her.
3525860	3529860	Dr. Phil's handling of high-profile individuals was what initially drew the most controversy,
3529860	3534860	after all, they're the ones who most often have a platform to speak out if they experience maltreatment,
3534860	3537860	however, as with other situations I acknowledged earlier,
3537860	3539860	it's very hard to say how far this went back,
3539860	3542860	and it's doubtful that it was an isolated incident,
3542860	3544860	and other stories suggested they weren't.
3544860	3548860	I thought Dr. Phil was gonna save my daughter, and it did not happen.
3548860	3551860	This is Joelle, she's a mother who brought her pregnant daughter on the show
3551860	3554860	to hopefully get some help for her heroin addiction.
3554860	3556860	She claims she was promised round-the-clock supervision,
3556860	3560860	however, when her daughter began to detox, she didn't receive that.
3566860	3571860	After about four hours, Caitlin decided that she was gonna leave,
3571860	3576860	and we needed to go to get her something so that she would not withdraw
3576860	3578860	because it would hurt the baby at that point.
3578860	3582860	Not receiving help for four hours at a hospital and fearing for the safety of the baby,
3582860	3586860	Joelle felt she had no other option but to get her daughter immediately from heroin,
3586860	3591860	at which point they were transported to Skid Row with the camera person who filmed the entire ordeal.
3591860	3593860	They're arriving now.
3598860	3600860	Care to death right now.
3600860	3602860	Caitlin made a contact very quickly,
3602860	3605860	I gave her money, and she went on her way.
3605860	3609860	Approximately 30-45 minutes later, we found her.
3609860	3614860	She was happy, high, and we went back to the hotel at that point.
3614860	3616860	This was subsequently brought up on the show,
3616860	3620860	where McGraw chastises the mother for leaving the hospital and heading to Skid Row,
3620860	3622860	which, obviously, is not a safe place.
3622860	3626860	You think since her mom is a nurse, she would take her to the hospital,
3626860	3628860	but instead, they made a drug run.
3628860	3631860	I just wanted to help her feel better.
3631860	3634860	So that baby is high on heroin right now.
3634860	3638860	I can't alert LAPD before you walk off of this stage.
3638860	3641860	So you think forcing someone to get help like that is the best way?
3641860	3644860	I don't give a... what you think.
3644860	3646860	I'm concerned about your baby.
3646860	3650860	In this case, though, the mother claims she was cornered with how to treat the situation,
3650860	3653860	and told that if she had questioned aspects of the show that had caused her to take such measures,
3653860	3656860	her daughter wouldn't be able to receive the help that she needed.
3656860	3660860	There was a lot of manipulation, telling us what to say,
3660860	3663860	telling us how to act, telling us what to do.
3663860	3666860	I don't have an answer for why I did what I did.
3666860	3668860	I just wanted to help her feel better.
3668860	3671860	I was told, do not question anything he's saying,
3671860	3674860	or he could not give her the help that she needed.
3674860	3678860	How much is going to have to be lost before you pull your head?
3678860	3679860	This is it.
3679860	3682860	I'm not going to mince my words here.
3682860	3683860	That's a threat.
3683860	3685860	There is no two ways about it.
3685860	3686860	This person isn't a celebrity.
3686860	3688860	They're not copiously wealthy.
3688860	3691860	What Dr. Phil is offering these people is a chance to receive serious help,
3691860	3696860	to hold that over someone's head if they don't comply with your request to make sure Phillip's reputation
3696860	3698860	remains unscathed is extremely inhumane.
3698860	3700860	Now, once again, this is just an allegation,
3700860	3705860	but it certainly fits in with this idea that the producers were chasing a story and a reputation,
3705860	3709860	rather than prioritising the help they often advocated for on the show.
3709860	3713860	In the case of Joelle and her daughter, even if it didn't happen exactly as reported,
3713860	3716860	they were still escorted to skid row with a cameraman.
3716860	3720860	If there was proper medical supervision like the Dr. Phil show claimed,
3720860	3722860	how the hell did they end up there?
3722860	3727860	Responding to the claims, Martin Greenberg, a psychologist who is head of the show's personal affairs,
3727860	3733860	stated that officials only agreed to do the show if Joelle agreed to be responsible for her daughter's withdrawal,
3733860	3735860	which seems really weird from my perspective.
3735860	3737860	Surely that's what the medical professionals would be for,
3737860	3741860	and if you think someone is at any risk, you wouldn't bring them down at all.
3741860	3746860	Washing your hands of contractual culpability doesn't suddenly absolve you of any moral obligation.
3746860	3751860	Maybe as an entertainer that's a risk you would take, but certainly not as a person whose job is to keep people safe.
3751860	3755860	As a head of personal affairs, Greenberg is surprisingly bad at PR,
3755860	3760860	including providing seemingly confused and conflicting responses to claims about patient safeguarding.
3760860	3765860	Most of his responses reek of arrogance and dismissiveness towards the complaints they've been receiving,
3765860	3769860	though I'll give them credit because they do still emphasise personal responsibility.
3769860	3773860	In saying that these people are not willing to take responsibility for themselves,
3773860	3776860	I think it would be valid to flip the question in this case, and say,
3776860	3779860	is it not them who are not willing to take responsibility?
3779860	3784860	In attempting to explain why they may not be aware of whether a guest is at risk from their cravings,
3784860	3787860	Greenberg states, and I love this one,
3787860	3790860	addicts are notorious for lying, deflecting, and trivialising,
3790860	3794860	but if they are at risk when they arrive, then they were at risk before they arrived.
3794860	3799860	I've been trying to save the opinion part for later, but this is just such a rotten thing to say.
3799860	3803860	Sure, sometimes addicts struggle with being open about their problems,
3803860	3807860	but the fact they came to your show probably means they want help,
3807860	3809860	and it doesn't mean they're not deserving of it.
3809860	3815860	For you to make a general ad hominem attack to deflect responsibility from the show is cowardly,
3815860	3818860	and I would expect better from a psychologist.
3818860	3822860	If you're aware of that behaviour, then surely that is reason for you to heighten the supervision,
3822860	3826860	not just leave them to their own devices and then shrug your shoulders.
3826860	3831860	The Dr Phil show cannot guarantee the eternal safety of all who attend their show,
3831860	3834860	however, they could at least ensure it on the premises.
3834860	3838860	Instead, guests turned up drunk, trips to Skid Row were made with a camera crew,
3838860	3843860	and the narrative of help was pushed to nauseating and even allegedly threatening degrees.
3843860	3849860	Sure, it was perfect TV, but what was happening behind the cameras?
3849860	3852860	How truly helpful was that help?
3880860	3882860	There is no but.
3882860	3888860	You either want the help or you don't, and if you want the help, you lean into it,
3888860	3891860	and you don't get back here. There's no pass and go.
3891860	3894860	You leave from here to there.
3894860	3898860	That requires very specialized care that I think you deserve.
3898860	3902860	I want you to have that help. I want this baby to have that help.
3902860	3909860	I am offering you the best help, in my opinion, in the United States.
3909860	3911860	Right.
3911860	3913860	And...
3913860	3915860	Please.
3915860	3917860	But...
3917860	3919860	Just say yes.
3919860	3920860	Stop talking to me.
3920860	3923860	I'm not here to be unfair or ignore the greater picture,
3923860	3927860	and I do want to acknowledge that there are plenty of people who will credit the Dr Phil show
3927860	3929860	for the difference it has made in their lives.
3929860	3932860	In discussing the subject of antics on the show, Greenberg says,
3932860	3935860	the only change is they are one step closer to getting help,
3935860	3938860	typically help they could not even come close to affording.
3938860	3942860	Greenberg presents the help the show is offering as a privilege.
3942860	3948860	Now, I know the health system is pretty broken, and that in many ways, it is a privilege to be seen so quickly.
3948860	3950860	With that said, it's a mutual thing.
3950860	3953860	Greenberg speaks like it's an act of charity,
3953860	3957860	but really, it's the least they can do for people who have fueled their daytime ratings.
3957860	3962860	In defending the show, Greenberg admits that appearing on Dr Phil is a step towards receiving the assistance
3962860	3965860	many typically desire to conquer their demons,
3965860	3967860	but Dr Phil isn't the endgame, he's the middleman,
3967860	3972860	and the success of the TV show has given them the power to also find treatment for their subject.
3972860	3976860	Now though, to touch on the fact that healthcare on this front can be very expensive,
3976860	3979860	as Greenberg acknowledges, there is a financial factor behind the show,
3979860	3983860	and Dr Phil has never really ran on a patient-based formula.
3983860	3988860	Yes my friends, there is a mystery third beneficiary to the sort of service being offered by Dr Phil,
3988860	3991860	that being the treatment facilities that these people are sent to,
3991860	3995860	many of whom advertise their relationship with the esteemed Dr Phil.
3995860	4000860	If certain people can afford it, these places have just been given the promotion for the help they offer.
4000860	4005860	When a guest comes on, Dr Phil will sometimes express to the viewers exactly what treatment facility
4005860	4009860	that person is being sent to, and the positive difference that it will make.
4009860	4014860	Such promotions are like a sponsorship really, and many media and even YouTube figures do sponsorships
4014860	4018860	with some very curious companies, and most of us know that we need to take them with a grain of salt.
4018860	4022860	Dr Phil, like many people, is a guy who is attempting to acquire the bag,
4022860	4025860	and honestly, there are worse things that he could promote.
4025860	4030860	If you're looking for something to do that's fun, relaxing, and good for your brain,
4030860	4036860	I have a perfect way for you to take a much needed break, and it's right on your phone for free.
4037860	4040860	It's an app game called Solitaire Grand Harvest.
4040860	4045860	Now, I have two guests here who say they play and love this game.
4045860	4049860	At the same time, such an endorsement does come with a degree of responsibility,
4049860	4052860	especially given the sensitive subjects that are often handled.
4052860	4055860	Was that due diligence being performed?
4055860	4058860	Well, the show seems to have agreements with a few facilities for treatment,
4058860	4061860	which Dr Phil of course sings his praises about,
4061860	4067860	but maybe they're perfectly qualified people, but there is a quite close relationship between Dr Phil and a lot of these places.
4067860	4072860	Now, one size never fits all, and there will always be people who will not find recovery in a treatment center,
4072860	4077860	and although I think there have been instances where McGraw was a little too enthusiastic about specific clinics,
4077860	4082860	see Duval, I understand that having a close relationship with specific places is probably for the best,
4082860	4085860	as it would allow one to maintain the highest quality of treatment.
4085860	4087860	However, was that high quality being delivered?
4087860	4090860	The problem is that once you tie yourself to specific institutions,
4090860	4094860	if the reputations of these places do come under scrutiny, it can reflect on you,
4094860	4097860	even if you're not involved in the management of the facility itself.
4097860	4101860	Obviously, there are factors that people can't be expected to be aware of,
4101860	4104860	yet over time, some believe this should have been fairly obvious.
4104860	4107860	Dr Lawless, stand up, would you please?
4107860	4111860	This is Dr Frank Lawless, head of the Psychoneuroplasticity Center,
4111860	4116860	which is a long, long way of saying they check people from A to Z.
4116860	4121860	The first query that one may raise is the actual suitability of many of these facilities for Dr Phil.
4121860	4125860	Now, McGraw hails from Texas, and many of his connections are from around that area,
4125860	4131860	such as the origins clinic, and the arbor, both of whom have facilities in Big Philly's home states.
4131860	4136860	Greenberg states that if a person requires medical attention, they will fly in the required medical personnel,
4136860	4138860	however, there seems to be a bit of disconnect with this system.
4138860	4144860	Although Herzog received his treatment from the arbor, Steve Thomason, who is the director of the facility,
4144860	4148860	has stated that Herzog did not and could not have received supervision on the show from them,
4148860	4150860	because they're not licensed in California.
4150860	4154860	In fact, Thomason states he completely regrets agreeing to working with the show in the first place,
4154860	4157860	and was so upset by the segment that he never agreed to work with them again.
4157860	4159860	This doesn't mean that Herzog wasn't supervised,
4159860	4165860	but it certainly created a disconnect between two entities that should be laboring towards a collective goal.
4165860	4168860	If a company is required to regularly supervise individuals in California,
4168860	4171860	should they not be licensed to do so in that state as well?
4171860	4173860	Are there not more suitable alternatives?
4173860	4175860	I want to introduce someone to you.
4175860	4177860	This is Mike Gurr down here.
4177860	4179860	He's the executive director at the Meadows Ranch,
4179860	4187860	and I've asked him to come here today because I've worked with Meadows for years,
4187860	4190860	and they, in my opinion, are the best of the best,
4190860	4195860	and I wanted you to have an opportunity to sit down and talk with them
4196860	4203860	and see if you feel like this might be a good opportunity for you.
4203860	4208860	You can't exactly blame Dr. Phil for involving prior business relationships in his present day ventures,
4208860	4211860	especially if he holds them in higher regard like he regularly claims he does.
4211860	4215860	However, business shouldn't really be the central matter of the TV show,
4215860	4217860	yet that's what some believed it to be,
4217860	4220860	particularly given Dr. Phil's presence as a brand.
4220860	4223860	The Boston Globe, who had published some of the most critical content of McGraw
4223860	4227860	during his social media renaissance, touched on this in a 2017 article
4227860	4232860	when covering the recent Dr. Phil path to recovery VR headset marketing shebang.
4232860	4238860	You're going to see on the screens what Eric is seeing in the goggles.
4238860	4240860	Now, this is prerecorded.
4240860	4243860	Okay, Eric, look up.
4243860	4245860	Now look to your left.
4245860	4247860	This is what he's seeing.
4247860	4251860	Now, what I've done here is I've put them in a bar situation.
4251860	4254860	So while they're in rehab, they're sitting talking to me in a bar.
4254860	4257860	Now they're sitting and this is actually in my backyard.
4257860	4262860	The Dr. Phil path to recovery VR headset is a system that supposedly aids addicts
4262860	4264860	with an interactive form of therapy with the man himself.
4264860	4266860	Although admittedly hard to establish,
4266860	4270860	there is no epidemiological evidence to show that it is successful,
4270860	4273860	but the Boston Globe claimed that there was one distinctive benefit,
4273860	4275860	that being the Dr. Phil namesake.
4275860	4278860	In reports, one potential client had informed the publication
4278860	4281860	that the selling point presented to them had been just that,
4281860	4285860	being told by the vice president for product sales that our job is to get your phones to ring,
4285860	4287860	and the admissions hopefully follow.
4287860	4292860	In essence, if you use the product, Dr. Phil is more likely to involve you on the TV show.
4292860	4294860	The crew at Dr. Phil swiftly denied this,
4294860	4298860	citing the fact that only two centers that use the product had even been mentioned on the TV show,
4298860	4300860	and they never made promises.
4300860	4305860	Nevertheless, they evaded responding on the matter of the actual comments made by the sales BP,
4305860	4308860	and their response doesn't really contradict the report.
4308860	4311860	It was never claimed that any promises were made or that a mention was guaranteed,
4311860	4317860	and using a reference who had been mentioned thus far isn't proof against what will be mentioned in the future.
4317860	4320860	Whether the VP was acting beyond his brief is certainly up for debate,
4320860	4323860	but it's hard to doubt that comments were probably made.
4323860	4328860	The Dr. Phil show always pursued the image of the program that was willing to put the mental health of its guests
4328860	4330860	at the heart of its message.
4330860	4333860	However, in many cases, it was clear that there was a conflict of interests,
4333860	4337860	and what may be best for the show and those behind it may not be the best for the guests,
4337860	4343860	and on closer analysis, in some cases, the places promoted were very questionable indeed.
4352860	4356860	I'll discuss this more soon, but I think besides obviously people who are suffering from substance issues,
4356860	4360860	another extremely vulnerable group are the youth, in particular those who have been brought on by their parents,
4360860	4363860	as it may not have been their own first course of action.
4363860	4367860	Now in many cases, when dealing with difficult children, adolescents, and even young adults,
4367860	4373860	they're experiencing a lot of hormonal and developmental changes, something that Dr. Phil is quite aware of.
4391860	4394860	Your job is to protect your child.
4394860	4397860	I'll probably discuss the morality involving young people in a bit,
4397860	4401860	but for guests really, as influential as a conversation with Dr. Phil may be,
4401860	4403860	the main change is going to come from actually receiving treatment,
4403860	4408860	and in that case, the centres are essential to making sure the chances of this happening are maximised,
4408860	4412860	and although it won't work for everyone, these individuals are kept safe and well.
4412860	4415860	Now in its time, Dr. Phil has recommended a few places,
4415860	4418860	and for most adult facilities, there weren't too many controversies,
4418860	4423860	but in the last few years there has been a bit of disquiet about two institutes that McGraw has had long-term relationships with,
4423860	4426860	both of which specialise in treating children with substance issues.
4426860	4430860	The first is a place in Florida, oh dear, called Inspirations.
4430860	4436860	They have been featured on the Dr. Phil show, and have also coincidentally used the Dr. Phil Road to Recovery VR headset.
4436860	4440860	In their appearances on the show, McGraw was highly complimentary about the work they were doing.
4440860	4446860	This is Karen Walsh, she's the owner of Inspirations for Youth and Families.
4446860	4450860	It's the nation's leading family addiction treatment and dual diagnosis centre,
4450860	4455860	and affiliate of the Cove Centre for Recovery in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.
4455860	4459860	And fair enough, if they're doing that work, then they deserve to receive their due credit.
4459860	4461860	However, some of the evidence suggested otherwise.
4461860	4466860	Beyond the owner's own legal issues, much of which happened during the years that Dr. Phil claimed to be working with them,
4466860	4469860	there was a more concerning issue regarding the centre itself.
4469860	4472860	We're at Inspirations for Youth and Families,
4472860	4477860	and what we do is we work with teenagers and their families every day,
4477860	4485860	and we help them to figure out how they're going to get past this point in their life where a teenager is struggling with drugs.
4485860	4490860	Now it's important that I keep this in perspective, it's a challenge to treat anyone who may struggle with addiction,
4490860	4494860	particularly if you're trying to put them back on the slope to a normal functioning life.
4494860	4497860	They need guidance, but you can't afford to be too authoritarian,
4497860	4501860	therefore it is possible that patients may flee the premises, and needs to be found.
4501860	4504860	With this in mind, Inspirations' record on this was a bit less than stellar,
4504860	4507860	according to a private investigator who worked within this industry.
4507860	4514860	In 2017, it was estimated that approximately 180 police reports for missing teenagers have been made in the space of the previous two years,
4514860	4519860	some of whom went missing for days and others ending up on the wrong side of the law completely.
4519860	4524860	To quote the PI, obviously there's a gap somewhere, a loophole somewhere in the system where they're just leaving.
4524860	4527860	Since these articles, Inspiration doesn't appear to have received much coverage,
4527860	4530860	and the video where their work was promoted has the comments disabled.
4530860	4533860	How with all this information available, it is fair to ask the question,
4533860	4538860	why Dr. Phil decided to characterise the institution as a leading family addiction centre?
4538860	4541860	How do you even know who's leading? Is there a leaderboard?
4541860	4545860	If there is, I highly doubt Inspirations is near the top, but I digress.
4545860	4550860	Inspirations is an example of a place that has some function but falters in its execution,
4550860	4553860	which is pretty vital given the sort of people they're meant to be treating,
4553860	4556860	and although nobody has come forward with any horror stories,
4556860	4560860	it shouldn't have been too difficult to properly vet a place that deals with such a sensitive matter.
4560860	4565860	However, as we'll see with our second example, that doesn't seem to be the Dr. Phil show's forte.
4586860	4612860	In 2010, Dr. Phil came face to face with two challenging adolescent sisters,
4612860	4616860	who he and many others felt were taking advantage of their parents and staged an intervention,
4616860	4619860	sending them to a resort that we'll talk about in a little bit.
4633860	4635860	Despite the apparently successful treatment of the younger sister,
4635860	4638860	the older sister was still acting out, much to the parent's dismay.
4639860	4641860	However, against Dr. Phil's advice and the mother's opinion,
4641860	4645860	the father did not want to send his daughter to an Aspen Group boarding school,
4645860	4647860	as he felt it was not in their best interests,
4647860	4652860	which led once again to Dr. Phil inviting them back on for further discussion on the matter.
4668860	4683860	This episode billed them as the most frustrating parents,
4683860	4685860	and Dr. Phil's attitude seemed to reflect that,
4685860	4687860	opening up the episode by quoting enraged viewers,
4687860	4691860	and then proceeding to sit down with them and taking them to a task on their failings,
4691860	4696860	while spectators froth at their mouths a stark reminder of what happens when you do not listen to the esteemed Dr. Phil.
4698860	4702860	I'm really disappointed that your show is only interested in supporting Aspen programs,
4702860	4706860	and not other highly qualified programs that could benefit my daughters.
4706860	4713860	Obviously, what's beneficial for my daughters is secondary to what is good for the show and for Aspen.
4713860	4716860	I understand that first and foremost, you have a business to run.
4718860	4720860	Are you serious?
4721860	4723860	Are you serious when you write this?
4723860	4725860	This is offensive to me.
4725860	4731860	I just have to tell you, when I read this, my initial reaction was, I'm done.
4731860	4737860	We have an advisory board, it's like 20 people, the top minds in psychology, sociology, medicine.
4737860	4741860	When we get a story, it goes out to our advisory board, and we ask them for input.
4741860	4747860	One of the top therapeutic residential programs on the globe is the Aspen Group.
4747860	4752860	So we reach out to them and say, hey guys, will you help us here?
4752860	4759860	We work with dozens of people all over the country, but the collective wisdom is that that's who we're going to contact here.
4759860	4762860	Other than an outwardly admitting that he has a business arrangement,
4762860	4765860	and accusing the father of requesting financial support for his own preferences,
4765860	4770860	despite the fact that he never seemingly wrote that, McGraw doesn't really provide much of a real response to the father
4770860	4774860	as to why it's in this girl's best interest to attend a boarding school,
4774860	4778860	other than broad philosophical narratives, and expressing how insulted he felt,
4778860	4783860	how he consults all the experts, etc. etc. etc. Dr. Phil is the fucking best, whatever.
4783860	4788860	The Aspen Group is one of the top residential therapeutic programs on the globe.
4788860	4791860	How could you not send your child there?
4791860	4797860	Is your teen out of control? The Aspen Education Group can help you get that teen back on track.
4797860	4804860	Aspen's nationwide network of programs has been featured on my show for years, and they can help your family too.
4804860	4811860	You can call an Aspen consultant today to learn more about their outstanding residential and outdoor programs.
4811860	4816860	Well, a large majority of the Aspen Group's projects have been closed down or sold in the last decade.
4816860	4819860	In fact, there is not a single boarding school still being operated by them,
4819860	4824860	with a fair few scandals that were well known by the time that Dr. Phil went on his verbal crusade against the father,
4824860	4828860	including one to a boarding school that resulted in an investigation that concluded that
4828860	4833860	the agency had reasonable cause to believe that abuse or neglect occurred at the school, six months before this episode.
4833860	4836860	Another place formerly known as Island View has had so many controversies,
4836860	4839860	it would be funny if the stories weren't deeply depressing,
4839860	4843860	including one in which a girl was fully isolated for 58 days after running away,
4843860	4849860	an isolation in which she had to rely on staff attention to even interact with anyone, which did have its occasional failings.
4849860	4855860	Dr. Phil was even sooner relating to one of these stories a few years later, but came out on top that time.
4855860	4859860	I believe in these folks right here. I believe they have traction.
4859860	4865860	If you want to get Alexis there, and Aspen is still willing after all of this,
4865860	4875860	and what I consider to be disrespect from you about their motives, then I will make that available to you.
4875860	4880860	I don't know, I feel maybe this whole Aspen Group gig isn't everything it's cracked up to be,
4880860	4884860	and actually whether by intent or not, the father was in the right.
4885860	4890860	But the Dr. Phil's reputation preceded it, Dr. Phil knows what's best for your children,
4890860	4893860	he has files on top of files, and if you're to suggest otherwise,
4893860	4899860	you're giving in to your offspring's manipulative ploys that have driven a wedge between you and the rest of the family.
4899860	4902860	It's a shtick, and it's one that wasn't always completely applicable,
4902860	4906860	particularly when the real-world evidence didn't exactly support what was being promoted,
4906860	4910860	and when you're dealing with young people that's not something that can be remedied,
4910860	4916860	in so many places of debatable standing, it was only a matter of time until one came to the forefront of public discussion.
4934860	4937860	Many of you probably don't remember this, or even know about it,
4937860	4941860	in the 21st century there was this series that had some international presence known as Brat Camp.
4941860	4944860	It was most popular in the UK where it ran for five seasons,
4944860	4948860	but did have some counterparts in continental Europe and even a US series.
4948860	4954860	As you can maybe guess, the premise was built around adolescence with behavioural and substance issues going to a camp,
4954860	4960860	and having those issues addressed, however this wasn't any standard therapy centre, this was more a wilderness camp.
4960860	4963860	They teach the kids the ways of the wild west,
4963860	4971860	and believe a strict regime of chores, tough rules and harsh punishment can turn bad kids into good kids.
4971860	4975860	I have all the compassion in the world for these people, for these kids,
4975860	4980860	but I just lack a little sympathy because of the way their behaviour is, and that's what we need to work on.
4980860	4985860	In the UK the first season was such a resounding success that they decided to invest in a second series,
4985860	4991860	however the producers of this show decided to raise the stakes by casting more challenging teens with intensified drama.
4991860	4996860	Upon hearing this, the ranch that was featured in the first series, Red Cliff Ascent, refused to host another series,
4996860	5001860	stating that they were a treatment program, not a TV show. Completely fair.
5001860	5006860	So the team behind Brat Camp set their sights on another location, this being Escalante, Utah,
5006860	5009860	the home of a humble spot known as Turnabout Ranch.
5009860	5015860	Turnabout Ranch is one of the many haciendas that have taken on the role of doubling up as a centre for wilderness therapy.
5015860	5020860	This sort of therapy is different to the traditional idea of such, it promotes living with the land,
5020860	5024860	devoid of the privileges or luxuries that modern life has typically afforded us.
5024860	5030860	However, Turnabout Ranch was certainly on the more austere side of these projects, it wasn't Malibu to say the least.
5031860	5035860	Everybody get up now. Slumber party's over, get up.
5038860	5042860	Quit talking, everybody down here now. Out of bed, let's go.
5046860	5049860	Foul language is not appropriate. Foul language is not appropriate.
5050860	5056860	No talking. You're going to spend three days out there. It's going to be three of the worst days you've spent a long time in your life.
5056860	5059860	You're going to hate every second of it. There's going to be a lot of tears, a lot of emotions.
5061860	5065860	So if you want to make it five days, it's your choice. But I'm not going to put up with it.
5065860	5072860	In most American camps, the impact stage is used to physically exhaust rebellious kids into being more compliant.
5073860	5076860	But at Turnabout, they have a unique strategy.
5077860	5083860	For three whole days, the kids are made to stay in a small stone circle in total silence.
5083860	5087860	In hindsight, it's hard not to understand why these sorts of shows aren't being aired today.
5087860	5092860	They're a pretty cruel form of therapy, and although some people did manage to turn their lives around,
5092860	5096860	others didn't, and one former contestant of another series even died in 2009.
5096860	5101860	How these sorts of residences continued long after the end of the TV shows that documented their methods.
5101860	5107860	In fact, Turnabout in particular went on to be one of the most popular resorts for teens featured on a popular daytime show.
5107860	5109860	I wonder what that show could be.
5110860	5115860	From the Aspen Education Group, she's one of many groups that we work with.
5115860	5117860	She works with Turnabout Ranch.
5117860	5122860	Dr Phil has always made a point of not approaching people from the same perspective that many TV shows hosted.
5122860	5128860	His conversations with troubled people were always staged more like an intervention rather than an interrogation,
5128860	5130860	though sometimes the former did seep into the latter.
5130860	5134860	With this in mind, although Dr Phil did want people to take responsibility for their actions,
5134860	5138860	it wasn't like they weren't deserving of humane treatment and sympathy.
5138860	5141860	However, those who were most troubled, he sent them to Turnabout Ranch.
5141860	5145860	That in many ways seemed very much against what he regularly preached on the show.
5145860	5150860	Turnabout Ranch wasn't a particularly friendly place, it was the sort of place where if you struggled more,
5150860	5155860	you'd receive more severe treatment, as documented in Brat Camp and in Testimonies by Others.
5155860	5163860	Yet in 2010, Turnabout Ranch made its debut on the Dr Phil show with an inspirational segment featuring former guests and a softly spoken rancher.
5169860	5172860	Being here helped me find happiness.
5172860	5175860	When Elena first arrived here, she was very resistant.
5175860	5179860	I was furious. Like, I hate everyone.
5179860	5182860	She really turned and made some major progress.
5182860	5188860	After a couple of days, I was like, wow, it is my fault. I got myself in this situation.
5188860	5193860	She really shines as one of our leaders and she takes a lot of pride in what she does.
5193860	5197860	Ironically enough, this debut clip featured the girls who I mentioned earlier.
5197860	5202860	Most notably Elena, the younger sister who seemed much more receptive to the Ranch's treatment.
5202860	5207860	The Ranch was presented as a hands-on getaway where youngsters could build a closer relationship to the wildlife
5207860	5210860	and garner a greater appreciation for those around them.
5210860	5215860	It seemed pretty positive, however, as Elena's older sister showed, it wasn't a formula that worked for everyone.
5215860	5220860	In spite of this though, McGraw and Co proceeded with a pretty close partnership over the following years,
5220860	5226860	sending many troubled teens here, leading up to arguably our most high-profile case, Danielle Bregoli.
5227860	5249860	Danielle Bregoli was always a bit of an exceptional individual,
5249860	5254860	and after her appearances on the Dr. Phil show, McGraw felt there was no other option than to send her to the Turnabout Ranch.
5254860	5259860	After all, it was always his answer to those he viewed as the entitled generation.
5259860	5264860	Bregoli was a person who continuously undermined Phil and all those who tried to help her,
5264860	5268860	and as a last resort, perhaps a more challenging environment would aid her outlook.
5268860	5272860	So at the end of 2016, she spent four and a half months in Turnabout Ranch,
5272860	5276860	and whatever she experienced there ultimately didn't have any lasting impact,
5276860	5281860	as not too long after, she appeared back on the Dr. Phil show ever defined in her nature.
5282860	5287860	When you were at Turnabout, you said that you had learned that material things didn't mean as much anymore.
5287860	5290860	That was just a show, damn.
5290860	5292860	That was just so I could get out of there.
5292860	5293860	Let me put it this way.
5293860	5297860	Y'all could put me in a program for six years and I'm going to come out the same person I came in.
5297860	5301860	How is it being back home?
5301860	5303860	I don't know, it's just home.
5303860	5304860	What do you want to tell Dr. Phil?
5304860	5306860	What I told him last time.
5306860	5307860	Thumbs up my d***.
5307860	5310860	What do you want to see happen on the show this time?
5310860	5313860	This time I won't be throwing water at nobody ever throwing hands at somebody.
5313860	5317860	By then, it should have been clear that the Turnabout Ranch didn't really function for everyone,
5317860	5321860	but upon her return, it was framed like the failure of such therapy was Bregoli's own fault,
5321860	5328860	when in reality, it was clear that the Dr. Phil format wasn't ever effective for someone so aware of their own media presence like Bregoli.
5328860	5330860	She knew what the point of Turnabout Ranch would be,
5330860	5335860	why would she conform to those expectations when her whole existence is based on rebellion?
5335860	5338860	Not many people stop to think that maybe Bregoli wasn't to blame.
5339860	5342860	Phil would probably suggest that the fact that she seemed to behave better at Turnout Ranch
5342860	5345860	meant that it must be the fault of the home environment,
5345860	5348860	but if it genuinely worked in transforming Bregoli's mindset,
5348860	5350860	a changing environment wouldn't affect that.
5350860	5353860	She's just gotten onto the fact that if she didn't cause as much disruption,
5353860	5355860	they'd likely be friendlier towards her.
5355860	5357860	However, that's not a philosophy adopted by everyone.
5357860	5361860	You see, in the time between 2010 and 2017,
5361860	5363860	Turnabout Ranch had been involved in numerous controversies,
5363860	5365860	including a lawsuit which alleged torture,
5365860	5368860	another patient that claimed to have covered up a sexual assault case,
5368860	5370860	and probably the most significant situation,
5370860	5374860	an actual homicide that occurred during Danielle Bregoli's time at Turnabout Ranch.
5374860	5378860	Clay Brewer, a disturbed teen who had been sent there to receive treatment,
5378860	5382860	attacked a staffer with a blunt object who subsequently succumbed to their injuries.
5382860	5385860	This was during the controversial circle therapy shown earlier,
5385860	5389860	which isolates individuals and is supposed to give them time to think about their lives.
5389860	5393860	But in the wrong environment, it's completely valid to see how this would also be detrimental to an individual.
5393860	5395860	Now, it should be clear that when something awful happens,
5395860	5399860	there has to be a level of responsibility accepted by the individual,
5399860	5400860	even if they're a minor,
5400860	5402860	but there also has to be some question about how,
5402860	5403860	with all this considered,
5403860	5406860	Bregoli was meant to come back the happy-go-lucky teen next time.
5406860	5408860	If this was just going to be swept under the rug
5408860	5412860	and people were going to act like patients should just take it in their stride,
5412860	5414860	then they probably had another thing coming.
5414860	5416860	And eventually, they did.
5423860	5432860	The 21st century definitely prompted us to take a different perspective on talk shows in general,
5432860	5434860	and the tabloid genre was no exception,
5434860	5439860	especially given that it often generated the most controversy out of any form of that entertainment.
5439860	5441860	I've heard some crazy stories over the years,
5441860	5447860	but one topic that keeps me scratching my head is when women fake being pregnant.
5447860	5454860	Okay, so this is Shane, and he says gay people are disgusting and weak.
5454860	5456860	Right here, we've got Greg.
5456860	5460860	Greg says that he is terrified of gay people.
5460860	5461860	Even in the early days of the genre,
5461860	5465860	incidents had occurred that raised questions about the ethics of this content,
5465860	5469860	most notably in 1995, when on an episode of the Jenny Jones shows,
5469860	5473860	Scott Amadur, a gay man, had expressed love for their male friend Jonathan Schmitz.
5473860	5476860	While this confession was seemingly brushed off at first by the male friend,
5476860	5479860	three days later, Amadur died at the hands of him.
5479860	5483860	Lawsuits and interviews subsequently revealed that the producers of the show had misled Schmitz
5483860	5485860	into thinking that his admirer was a woman,
5485860	5490860	while being aware of his history of mental disturbance and alcohol slash substance abuse.
5490860	5492860	Although not solely responsible for Amadur's death,
5492860	5495860	there was little doubt that the actions of the show provoked a tragedy
5495860	5500860	while disregarding a culture that was still very hostile towards people of differing sexual preferences.
5500860	5502860	It was clear that when dealing with such sensitive topics,
5502860	5505860	there was a lack of diplomacy in the pursuit for ratings,
5505860	5507860	and this could easily have negative consequences.
5507860	5509860	Nonetheless, this also worked to the genre's advantage,
5509860	5512860	as it purported to show the uglier side of humanity.
5512860	5515860	Therefore, certain incidents were going to be inevitable.
5515860	5518860	Whether it was even fair to show these in the first place is a question that I'll get to later,
5518860	5520860	but in cases such as Jeremy Kyle,
5520860	5524860	it was clear that mistreatment of people was so commonplace because it was expected,
5524860	5526860	and in both cases of Jones and Kyle,
5526860	5529860	these shows were only ever fully reprimanded when someone actually died.
5529860	5533860	Hell, the Jenny Jones show continued for an additional eight years
5533860	5535860	after the death of the aforementioned guest.
5535860	5537860	Doctor Phil was different, though.
5537860	5542860	You've got to miss siblings, you've got to miss those that...
5542860	5544860	I think about it every day.
5544860	5549860	Like, I just, I miss my twin sister, I miss my brother.
5549860	5551860	I miss all of them, really.
5551860	5553860	You don't have to miss Abba because she's here.
5553860	5554860	Abba, come on out.
5554860	5566860	Although he wasn't afraid to tackle the tough subjects,
5566860	5569860	he still did it with the narrative of helping and supporting these people,
5569860	5571860	who he knew, as a professional,
5571860	5573860	were still encountering some form of struggle,
5573860	5575860	regardless of what they may have done.
5575860	5577860	Therefore, in spite of the space that he operated in,
5577860	5580860	Doctor Phil still had a reputation to uphold,
5580860	5582860	and as someone who had been under fire for the past few years,
5582860	5586860	and embroiled in lawsuits, this was certainly going to be a challenge.
5586860	5590860	The era that we live in is also quite different to that of 1995.
5590860	5593860	The online world definitely enabled an interconnectivity
5593860	5596860	that allowed people to spread their messages more effectively,
5596860	5598860	and by establishing himself as an online presence,
5598860	5601860	thanks to the help of platforms like YouTube and those who existed there,
5601860	5604860	he also opened himself up to criticism from the platform,
5604860	5606860	and by 2021, it had long been brewing.
5606860	5609860	The thing about YouTube is that it's a two-way street.
5609860	5613860	If you have a public spat or altercation where you platform that person,
5613860	5617860	there are very few plugs that can be pulled on another person's ability to broadcast publicly,
5617860	5621860	and you can very easily provide them a platform through your own actions.
5621860	5623860	This was exactly the case with Danielle Bregoli,
5623860	5626860	who by 2021 went by the name of Bad Baby,
5626860	5628860	and was well known outside of YouTube.
5628860	5631860	However, in April, she returned to the platform that immortalized her,
5631860	5635860	with the intent on presenting our esteemed TV host with an ultimatum.
5636860	5641860	So, Dr. Phil, I'm going to give you from now till April 5th to issue an apology,
5641860	5646860	not only to me, but to Hannah and any other child that you sent to Turnabout
5646860	5650860	or any other program like this, and if you don't, I'm going to handle things my way.
5650860	5653860	Somewhere in the middle of August, I went on the Dr. Phil show,
5653860	5656860	and my mom and my grandma knew they were sending me here.
5656860	5657860	I didn't know I was going.
5657860	5659860	I went school shopping right before because the school was supposed to start
5659860	5662860	when I got home from L.A. from doing the show.
5662860	5666860	So, part of the whole Dr. Phil show is they send these kids to either Turnabout
5666860	5668860	or these other programs that are also in Utah,
5668860	5671860	but they're all wilderness programs, and they're all fucked up.
5671860	5674860	This video not only called out the modus operandi of the show,
5674860	5676860	but also the treatment at Turnabout Branch,
5676860	5679860	and the supposed therapy that they received there.
5679860	5681860	So, for the first three days, there is no showering.
5681860	5684860	They put you in a circle, which is a TP.
5684860	5687860	It's a little TP, but it's open, and you have to sit there for three days.
5687860	5689860	They wouldn't let me lay down for nothing.
5689860	5692860	I was falling asleep, and they were like, uh-uh, get up, get up.
5692860	5695860	So, I'm just sitting here like, this is going to be really bad.
5695860	5699860	When I see these people have no sympathy, I was like, oh, I'm really doomed.
5699860	5704860	They take away necessity privileges, like sleeping on a bed, eating good food,
5704860	5706860	not being cold, witnessing it.
5706860	5711860	If you reported another kid getting bullied by their peers or something,
5711860	5715860	they would just say, well, maybe that's what they need, or something like that.
5715860	5719860	Even though there was written rules, if a staff was angry at the moment,
5719860	5721860	or if you just did something that they felt was bad,
5721860	5723860	you would get your own punishment.
5723860	5724860	They would make up their own punishment for you.
5724860	5727860	It's really frustrating, because even if you don't know the rules,
5727860	5729860	if you fuck up, you're still in trouble.
5729860	5731860	There's not no, I didn't know.
5731860	5733860	You're still in deep shit.
5733860	5737860	They had no problem holding kids down, which is against the law.
5737860	5740860	You're not supposed to touch the kids, but they had no problem doing that.
5740860	5743860	It's just our word against the staff's word when you're there,
5743860	5746860	because there's no witnesses, there's no cameras, you don't have a phone.
5746860	5747860	There's none of that.
5747860	5750860	That's why I was always so scared to speak out, because no one's going to believe me.
5750860	5753860	Now this is of course a personal testimony.
5753860	5756860	However, looking at the episodes of Brat Camp that I had archived,
5756860	5757860	this all seemed very feasible.
5757860	5760860	For some, of course, this would seem like appropriate disciplinary measures
5760860	5762860	against an ill-mannered teen.
5762860	5765860	However, this was also never really explained on Dr. Phil,
5765860	5768860	and as a matter of fact, whenever discussing Turnabout Ranch,
5768860	5772860	footage would always be shown of an activity more wholesome, such as horse riding.
5773860	5775860	I doubt that was unintentional.
5775860	5777860	One morning I was cleaning up for breakfast,
5777860	5779860	and one of the staff members was standing right next to me,
5779860	5781860	and she had her walkie on her, so I heard everything.
5781860	5783860	One of the kids, he had tried to steal a car or something,
5783860	5786860	everyone was screaming on the walkies like it was really crazy,
5786860	5788860	and he ended up killing one of the staff members.
5788860	5790860	They made all the kids that were at Roundy come down,
5790860	5792860	and then they told us not to tell us anything.
5792860	5796860	A day later, every kid that's at Turnabout, they have us all in a circle,
5796860	5799860	and they're like, listen, it was an incident, I know some of y'all heard it over the walkies,
5799860	5800860	Jimmy died.
5801860	5803860	And so we're all freaking out, because Jimmy was, like I said,
5803860	5806860	he was one of them that was there the first day I got there, he was really sweet.
5806860	5810860	Not only did Jimmy die, but one of the other staff members that was there at the time,
5810860	5813860	Alicia, who was the daughter of the nurse,
5813860	5818860	Alicia, she was injured, and two years later she died,
5818860	5822860	and she was also left disabled after being attacked by Clay.
5822860	5825860	Bregoli's recounting of the Turnabout Ranch goes over many unnerving details,
5825860	5827860	including that relating to the death of the staff,
5828860	5831860	and how that would understandably affect a young person residing there,
5831860	5833860	however there are more details she wanted to reveal.
5834860	5839860	A young lady, her name is Hannah, she recently spoke out,
5839860	5842860	because while she was there, she was sexually assaulted,
5842860	5846860	and then when she reported that she was assaulted, she was punished by staff.
5846860	5851860	Now, when I seen the punishment she was given, I knew like,
5851860	5854860	okay, I really have to say something, I really have to have her back on this,
5854860	5856860	because I truly believe that they did that.
5856860	5860860	This claim covered the alleged violation of someone who was staying at the ranch at the same time,
5860860	5863860	and how she was treated by personnel when she complained about it.
5863860	5866860	It was clearly a matter that Bregoli took very seriously,
5866860	5869860	and with this information it was easy to understand why she expected, at the least,
5869860	5871860	an apology from the man himself.
5871860	5874860	Would they receive it? Well, not really.
5874860	5877860	Around a week after the publication of the video,
5877860	5880860	Dr. Phil made an appearance on the Ashley Banfield show NewsNation
5880860	5882860	to discuss this matter further.
5882860	5884860	This was a pretty significant moment in the show's history,
5884860	5887860	as Dr. Phil had very rarely taken to interviews to address situations
5887860	5890860	which may question his character, outside the show at least.
5890860	5893860	However, after a few minutes you begin to see why.
5893860	5898860	Well, you know, she went to turnabout four or five years ago,
5898860	5901860	and she had a bad experience.
5901860	5904860	Obviously, I would hate that, we'd be sorry about that,
5904860	5911860	but we don't have anything to do with what happens with guests once they leave the stage.
5911860	5917860	I mean, that's between the guardian and the parent, and whatever facility they go to.
5917860	5920860	So he does say that he would be sorry if she'd had a bad experience.
5920860	5924860	I suppose that is a half-apology, but I don't think there's that much question
5924860	5926860	that she had a bad experience by the sound of it,
5926860	5929860	regardless of whether what she's saying is 100% honest.
5929860	5933860	I don't think we need any ifs at this point, if that's the threshold for an apology.
5933860	5938860	What else is there but some tough love, you know, at a ranch or where else?
5938860	5941860	You can't coddle kids like that.
5941860	5945860	He also seems to distance himself from his own personal involvement in Turnabout Ranch.
5945860	5949860	And okay, although I would say it's difficult to hold Dr. Phil personally responsible
5949860	5953860	for the actions of another individual, this still isn't an honest reply.
5953860	5957860	To be frank, the idea that they have absolutely no involvement is just preposterous.
5957860	5961860	The countless promotional videos, the unrivalled, unquestioning praise,
5961860	5964860	they all say far much more than McGraw can say in a single interview.
5964860	5968860	Dr. Phil was extremely enthusiastic about the organisations he worked with,
5968860	5971860	even to the point of roasting parents who didn't agree.
5971860	5973860	He could have acted shocked when confronted with this information,
5973860	5975860	and it would have been more convincing than him saying
5975860	5979860	they don't have anything to do with these places once they're out of Dr. Phil's care.
5979860	5985860	So we're not involved in that, we don't have any feedback from them,
5985860	5992860	so whatever happens once they're there, that's between them and the facility.
5992860	5996860	I assume she had a problem, she filed a complaint with the proper authorities
5996860	6000860	or something five years ago, so I really don't know much about it.
6000860	6007860	And we asked them for input on one of the top therapeutic residential programs on the globe.
6007860	6009860	Yeah, right.
6009860	6013860	Tonight on an all-new episode, the dangers of Dr. Phil.
6013860	6028860	A few months after the video and the subsequent Dr. Phil interview,
6028860	6031860	it was announced that the victim of the violation that Bregoli had spoken about,
6031860	6035860	Hannah Archuleta, was initiating a lawsuit against Dr. Phil and their collaborating studios
6035860	6038860	for the participation in sending children to Turnabout Ranch,
6038860	6043860	or supposedly being aware of the many controversies that the centre had been involved in since the early 2010s.
6043860	6048860	We'll address the result of that in a bit, but it definitely posed the question of how ignorant Dr. Phil could be
6048860	6051860	to the many problems that seemed evident to any onlooker,
6051860	6056860	and these qualms would only be heightened as the industry looked more inward to address problems of workplace culture.
6056860	6061860	2020 was an interesting year for many reasons, however, as many viewers of this channel may recall,
6061860	6065860	it was the year where the conduct of certain talk show hosts was brought into question,
6065860	6070860	and their otherwise beloved reputation challenged. Probably the most notable example of this was Ellen,
6070860	6073860	who many claimed was an all-round unpleasant person to deal with,
6073860	6079860	while the working conditions behind the scenes of her supposedly lovable show were comparable to that of an authoritarian regime.
6079860	6084860	Needless to say, whether you believed in every story's verity or not, the effect it had on the show was evident,
6084860	6087860	with ratings plummeting, and barely a couple of years later,
6087860	6092860	The Ellen DeGeneres Show was brought to an end after 19 seasons of mostly enjoyed success.
6092860	6095860	The allegations certainly shook up the industry to say the least,
6095860	6100860	and lifted the veil on the often hushed workplace culture that had seldom received scrutiny.
6100860	6106860	For many, it was a bad experience, but up until then, many former employees had likely viewed it through the lens of any other job.
6106860	6111860	The difference is, when you're dealing with celebrities who preach the principles that aren't necessarily reflected in their private persona,
6111860	6115860	there's a disingenuousness to their trade that makes you feel compelled to call them out.
6115860	6118860	However, while this was new in many corners of the industry,
6118860	6122860	arguably the tabloid talk shows should have been the most conscious of this.
6122860	6126860	They've been long subject to criticism regarding maltreatment of those around them,
6126860	6130860	especially given the often sensitive and revealing topics surrounding their guests.
6130860	6135860	As a matter of fact, in 2016, Dr. Phil and his producers had already been sued by a former employee
6135860	6137860	who had claimed they were falsely imprisoned during a meeting,
6137860	6141860	when McGraw had locked the doors and threatened employees after information had leaked.
6141860	6144860	The producers of Dr. Phil subsequently countersued, claiming that this employee,
6144860	6149860	who worked as a producer and director, had lifted footage from the production that infringed on the copyright,
6149860	6152860	employment, and confidentiality rights of the show.
6152860	6156860	In the end, the judge sided with the producers, and the potential for further publicity seemed to burn out.
6156860	6161860	At first, it seemed that Dr. Phil had avoided the blast radius of the talk show apocalypse,
6161860	6166860	but barely a few months before Ellen's final episode on February 11th, 2022,
6166860	6171860	two present and ten former employees came forward to attest to a work environment that was anything but therapeutic.
6172860	6176860	In many ways, the allegations against the Dr. Phil show followed a similar narrative to those that had
6176860	6178860	sunk Ellen a couple of years before.
6178860	6183860	Although employees on the article did not directly witness McGraw berating or abusing employees,
6183860	6187860	many of the producers acted tyrannically towards those working on the show,
6187860	6190860	engaging in behaviour that caused serious upset and discomfort.
6190860	6193860	With how systemic and widespread the problem was in the workplace,
6193860	6197860	many found it difficult to believe that an accomplished, observant psychologist and TV host
6197860	6200860	would merely be ignorant to these incidents, with one being quoted as saying,
6200860	6202860	how can he not know?
6202860	6205860	Most of this centered in on a place called the control room,
6205860	6208860	which employees described as a war zone, with yelling, insults,
6208860	6212860	and all-round disrespect for employees who worked in those high pressure conditions.
6212860	6215860	The one public testimonial in this article comes from Tiffany Clark,
6215860	6217860	who briefly did some work on behalf of Paramount.
6217860	6221860	She said that during her short tenure, she was mercilessly berated by a supervisor
6221860	6225860	who threatened jobs and openly bragged about making other employees quit.
6225860	6228860	This information tells us a story endemic to many LA productions,
6228860	6232860	and if you remove the names, you probably wouldn't be able to tell it from a show like Ellen.
6232860	6237860	However, there was an aspect that set these claims apart from your usual studio hellhole.
6237860	6241860	As we noted, there are multiple testimonies that assert that the show subtly nudged guests
6241860	6245860	towards problematic behaviour that may be connected with the struggles they were encountering,
6245860	6248860	all of whom are from the guests themselves and their relatives.
6248860	6250860	However, in this case, the employees appear to back up these claims,
6250860	6254860	with multiple stories regarding the instruction they received when handling the show's participants.
6254860	6257860	These included being encouraged to perpetuate racial stereotypes,
6257860	6260860	not being properly equipped to deal with mentally vulnerable guests,
6260860	6263860	and even one case where an employee claims they were directed to make sure a guest
6263860	6265860	did not take their medication before going on stage.
6265860	6269860	Former members of staff also say they were advised to manipulate and befriend guests
6269860	6273860	in an attempt to obtain bookings for the show, while profiling them on a variety of fronts.
6273860	6277860	This is partially substantiated by an excerpt from an email that commends workers
6277860	6279860	for convincing guests that they're trusted confidants,
6280860	6284860	but reminding them to keep their distance, as said guests will likely throw them under the bus,
6284860	6288860	not the sort of sympathetic outlook on guests that you'd expect from Dr. Phil.
6288860	6292860	By this time, such claims of workplace misconduct were becoming more and more pervasive,
6292860	6294860	and for such an environment, maybe that wasn't surprising,
6294860	6297860	it seems to be a deeply ingrained cultural issue.
6297860	6300860	However, the one aspect that should always be prioritised in this sort of show
6300860	6304860	is the safety of guests who genuinely need help above anything else,
6304860	6307860	something that Dr. Phil has always publicly preached.
6307860	6310860	This didn't appear to be a cultural misstep, this seemed to be intentional,
6310860	6313860	and for that, there were much more serious ramifications.
6313860	6316860	As always, it's important to present both sides,
6316860	6319860	and as many other stories reported, the team behind Dr. Phil did respond,
6319860	6323860	firstly denying any of the allegations regarding treatment of staff and guests,
6323860	6328860	while also referring their own members of staff to the publication in support of their perspective.
6328860	6331860	Their angle was that yes, filming of a show like Dr. Phil could be intense,
6331860	6334860	especially considering the unpredictability of those involved.
6334860	6337860	However, nobody has been abused, nobody has been treated unfairly,
6337860	6343860	and nobody was subjected to any forms of profiling or stereotyping under the watch of a show's executive.
6343860	6348860	We can't support one experience unquestionably without taking into account the other experiences,
6348860	6353860	and obviously the producers offered individuals who contradicted the accusatory testimonies written in the article.
6353860	6357860	However, the report definitely outlined a continuing narrative on the Dr. Phil show,
6357860	6359860	one that it was struggling to shake off.
6359860	6361860	This isn't the first time that such claims have been made,
6362860	6365860	and although an intensive workshop may create disgruntled employees,
6365860	6370860	it's hardly a complete explanation for the often corroborating stories from supposedly separate sources.
6370860	6372860	All I'd say is that in this case,
6372860	6376860	it's hard to blame people for believing what was being said with the information available,
6376860	6379860	whereas in the past, the Dr. Phil show had cast doubt on the guests and their families
6379860	6384860	by pointing to the possibility of ulterior motives and the fact that certain memories may be corrupted,
6384860	6386860	that didn't really apply here.
6386860	6389860	To be frank, there wasn't a copious amount of new evidence being presented,
6389860	6393860	but these claims were substantiated by what was already publicly available to viewers,
6393860	6398860	and only added an additional layer of credibility to the criticisms being levelled against the Dr. Phil crew.
6398860	6401860	But could it tell us anything about the man himself?
6420860	6426860	Other than the lawsuit in 2016,
6426860	6431860	we didn't really have much evidence that supported this idea that Dr. Phil was an outwardly unpleasant person
6431860	6435860	to those around him, and to be fair, you can't control everything your employees say or do.
6435860	6440860	However, many would argue that he had presented himself as a hands-on person who cared about making a difference
6440860	6443860	in these people's lives, and this seemed to contradict that.
6443860	6446860	Now, with everything considered, the show still hasn't picked up too much plaque,
6446860	6449860	I think mainly because controversy comes with the territory,
6449860	6452860	and such TV shows are never going to be completely unproblematic.
6452860	6457860	Whereas someone like Ellen was meant to represent an environment where people could just be unbridled in their joy,
6457860	6460860	Dr. Phil thrives on the energy of the guests as well,
6460860	6465860	many of whom bring their own, sometimes less-than-positive spirit to the stage.
6465860	6468860	That chaos seemed more in-built with that structure,
6468860	6471860	which unfortunately makes such workplace misconduct stand out less.
6471860	6474860	It's not a surprise that the Dr. Phil machine has mostly persisted,
6474860	6477860	rather unscathed from the troubles of the past few years.
6477860	6480860	However, this hasn't stopped people from asking questions,
6480860	6483860	and I think as skepticism of this form of therapy content in general rises,
6483860	6488860	then people are likely to revisit these claims, and time won't necessarily nullify them.
6488860	6491860	When put together in one place, they do tell a damning story,
6491860	6496860	and one that doesn't present the most flattering image of one of TV's most famous therapists.
6496860	6499860	Creating compelling television is always a struggle,
6499860	6502860	because a lot of people want to see what they often can't see in their own lives.
6502860	6506860	Therapy is one of those things that is personal, it's between two private individuals,
6506860	6511860	and obviously, for many in the psychological field, that confidentiality is part of the process,
6511860	6516860	a place where you can talk about your deepest, darkest thoughts with the hope of eventually expelling them.
6516860	6521860	It's hard to do something publicly when many would argue that privacy is part of its necessity.
6521860	6524860	After all, as people like Daniel Bregoli show,
6524860	6528860	when cameras and audience members are viewing you, you're conditioned to behave differently.
6528860	6532860	However, I also think there is value in people being open about their struggles,
6532860	6535860	and there being a medium to connect with that over.
6535860	6539860	There may not be a right way to do this, but there is a best way to do this.
6539860	6543860	By 2022, I think that critics had lost faith that this was the best way,
6543860	6545860	or that it was even a worthwhile route.
6545860	6548860	Whether it was Dr. Phil's individual will or not,
6548860	6552860	there were clearly conflicts of interest between driving the vehicle that creates entertaining TV,
6552860	6555860	and actually protecting the world being a vulnerable guest.
6555860	6559860	Even discounting the allegations, many of the clips spoke for themselves.
6559860	6560860	Hi, Dr. Phil.
6560860	6564860	Hi, I'm Todd. Nice to meet you.
6564860	6567860	How are you feeling, man? Can you walk?
6567860	6572860	Apparently, I have to have help.
6572860	6574860	Sorry, I'm very...
6574860	6577860	Although you could certainly attribute certain blame to individuals,
6577860	6581860	I think there was also a great question looming over the show that McGraw operated,
6581860	6583860	particularly regarding its methodology.
6583860	6588860	The prioritization of tell-all television is something that's always been valued in the industry.
6588860	6591860	However, I think there were new elements that Dr. Phil introduced
6591860	6596860	which made that pursuit more dangerous for people who may find themselves in a vulnerable place.
6596860	6601860	In a way, what the Dr. Phil show promoted as its greatest facets were also its greatest problems.
6601860	6605860	We return to this point of help, the one that McGraw helped set the program apart with
6605860	6608860	by collaborating with all these centers and clinics.
6608860	6613860	To me, it seems that the Dr. Phil showrunners either didn't realize the level of height and responsibility
6613860	6616860	that rested on their shoulders, or were aware and simply did not care.
6616860	6622860	One allegation in particular comes to mind, that made by the mother who had to visit Skid Row with her daughter,
6622860	6625860	that she'd been told that if she wanted her daughter to receive treatment that they were offering,
6625860	6629860	she would have to cooperate with the narrative being spun on stage.
6629860	6633860	I feel it's a believable scenario, but even if the details weren't exactly so,
6633860	6637860	I do think it underlines the extremely sensitive power dynamic that is present during the show.
6637860	6642860	On one hand, the notion of receiving help is a good idea that hasn't been nearly present in enough of these shows.
6642860	6646860	However, as the only party that can provide that help in these scenarios,
6646860	6650860	there's also an invisible dependence that is experienced by many of the guests.
6650860	6654860	They're relying on the show to offer that help, but that help is chosen by the show
6654860	6657860	and can be withdrawn at any time, as Dr. Phil explained himself.
6657860	6662860	One thing I knew for sure is that these girls were not ready to be home because home wasn't ready for these girls.
6662860	6668860	I told you that, I was clear about it, and then you say, well, I've actually talked to some other experts,
6668860	6674860	then you need to do what they want you to do. Best of luck to you, but I'm not going to support that.
6674860	6678860	Who wouldn't want to cooperate with Dr. Phil's narratives in these cases,
6678860	6681860	particularly when a person in your relationship with them are at stake,
6681860	6684860	and these people are their friends, their family.
6684860	6688860	Fleeting public dignity is a small price to pay to help your struggling relative to survive.
6688860	6692860	Dr. Phil said that he wasn't involved in the actual treatment after his show,
6692860	6695860	and that statement's falsehood is borderline self-explanatory.
6695860	6698860	If that statement was true, then this dynamic would never have existed,
6698860	6702860	as the help offered would be independent of whatever Dr. Phil says on his show.
6702860	6704860	Instead, they're intertwined.
6704860	6709860	The behavior exhibited on Dr. Phil's show directly influences the treatment these individuals receive.
6709860	6712860	Their actions on air dictates Dr. Phil's recommendations,
6712860	6717860	despite the many extraneous variables that can influence their deportment during these episodes.
6717860	6721860	Many of these people's progress continues to be covered and critiqued in front of the cameras,
6721860	6725860	even in these clinics and therapy centers. It's part of the show.
6725860	6727860	And if that's the choice of the show, then so be it,
6727860	6731860	but you have to acknowledge that it's a flaw system that can yield some complications,
6731860	6736860	and that it is an effect of the show you operate, regardless of whether you wish to admit it.
6736860	6741860	But if we're going to do this, we're going to do this my way.
6741860	6745860	So even if that help was flawed, many didn't want to cry or criticize it
6745860	6748860	because it could influence how they received that help.
6748860	6752860	Dr. Phil's seal of approval propelled a lot of these places into the spotlight,
6752860	6754860	and even if someone had a negative experience with such a place,
6754860	6758860	they may hesitate to speak up if they still have loved ones involved in the treatment.
6758860	6764860	And who would dare question the moral authority of someone as revered as Dr. Phil McGraw?
6764860	6768860	With all this in mind, it just makes his first response even worse.
6768860	6775860	We don't have anything to do with what happens with guests once they leave the stage.
6775860	6781860	If there is any shred of truth in what he said, it means that he had no investment or interest
6781860	6786860	in the quality of care provided by a lot of these places that he rode so hard for in his shows.
6786860	6790860	And these weren't simple sponsorships that people could go to if they wanted to,
6790860	6794860	these are the places that were offered specifically, and with all this in mind,
6794860	6800860	it becomes hard to buy that Dr. Phil had no knowledge whatsoever of the incidents that occurred at many of these places.
6800860	6805860	In a way, his response distanced himself far too much to the point where it just was not believable,
6805860	6810860	and a more straightforward theory seemed to emerge that shone a much darker light onto the show,
6810860	6812860	and how it had been operated.
6818860	6823860	Amongst the quagmire of other shows in the genre that regularly sought to put guests on the spot
6823860	6828860	in private affairs, indiscretions, and matters that only reserved as entertainment for the baying crowds.
6828860	6832860	Dr. Phil stood out to many, a beacon in how topics could be tackled on television.
6832860	6838860	Thanks to his skills, McGraw was often able to navigate topics and address guests in ways that appeared fair and astute.
6838860	6845860	The pursuit of perfection is, in and of itself, a flawed pursuit, because there is no perfection, you know that.
6845860	6849860	Nothing can ever get straight enough, perfect enough, clean enough, right enough.
6849860	6852860	Because if it is, you've got to go back and check it, right?
6852860	6857860	It didn't just make him popular with audiences, who felt his approach represented a more humanised perspective of guests,
6857860	6862860	but also with studios, who were often learning the hard way that such formulas could lead to disaster.
6862860	6867860	There has been no large-scale disaster on the Dr. Phil show, nothing that has defined the legacy of the show,
6867860	6871860	and as the ratings of competitors dropped, McGraw's ship remained stable.
6871860	6878860	The lack of emotional provocation directly from Dr. Phil often meant that people really couldn't do much with actual legal complaints.
6878860	6884860	Whatever happened couldn't directly be linked back to an appearance on Dr. Phil, it's not illegal to have guests after all.
6884860	6890860	There has to be some level of personal responsibility, something that Dr. Phil has always preached.
6890860	6897860	In a lot of tabloid talk shows, their format enabled responsibility for any misconduct to be assigned to the producers and the host,
6897860	6901860	because of their language and behaviour that may have affected the actions of these guests,
6901860	6903860	not just on the show, but subsequently after the show.
6903860	6909860	The public crucifixion many people were often subject to was life-ruining, a fate I wouldn't wish on nearly anyone,
6909860	6914860	and when these consequences became apparent, I think a lot of people realised TV needed to change.
6914860	6919860	Dr. Phil seemed above that, though, his show seemed to occupy this very neutral sphere,
6919860	6923860	where they merely provided a platform for these discussions and interventions to occur.
6923860	6927860	Whatever happened otherwise was ultimately the result of decisions made by individuals.
6928860	6931860	This reputation was bolstered by Dr. Phil's image and background,
6931860	6935860	which often applauded him as a professional voice whose words were rooted in scientific observation.
6935860	6941860	Although acknowledging that he was not a medical doctor or even a practicing psychologist, McGraw still leaned into this image,
6941860	6946860	with many products, shows, and public appearances that promoted him as a credible voice within the sphere.
6946860	6952860	All of this established him as a neutral, mild TV personality who merely wanted to teach people some common sense,
6952860	6955860	and his self-titled show followed that formula.
6955860	6959860	This perspective was reflected in Dr. Phil's response to Danielle Bregoli.
6959860	6964860	All he does on the show is sit there and make observations and recommend the support a person should receive.
6964860	6968860	The observation approach prides itself on attempting to dissect these subjects from a factual basis
6968860	6973860	and in a way that allows individuals to present themselves in their unfiltered, unprovoked form.
6973860	6977860	Now, in principle, it was questionable whether such a format could ever be truly neutral.
6977860	6982860	The involvement of an audience, TV cameras, sure, on paper, they're not directly accountable to a studio,
6982860	6986860	but they still influence outcomes of possible interventions and discussions
6986860	6990860	that would regularly refer to intimate and revealing details broadcast out there for eternity.
6990860	6996860	Yet you could defend the show on the basis that there has to be some public exposure for it to constitute a show at all.
6996860	7000860	Nevertheless, there were definitely certain hoops they'd have to jump through to retain this defence,
7000860	7002860	which is what some began to question.
7002860	7007860	First, you have that dynamic of dependence between the guests and the showrunners, then unspoken, assumed debt,
7007860	7011860	one that could very easily dictate personal behaviour and commentary on it.
7011860	7016860	However, deeper than that, we have the actual alleged conduct undertaken by people working behind the scenes,
7016860	7020860	that seemed to challenge their guests and their own personal responsibility for their demons.
7020860	7024860	As it's been preached, personal responsibility was extremely important,
7024860	7028860	and as far as we know, the crew of Dr. Phil never forced any guest's hand in their actions.
7028860	7034860	However, on multiple occasions, the Dr. Phil show appeared to be more orchestrated than those behind it were prepared to admit.
7034860	7040860	Their behaviour in attempting to make TV more engaging seemed to announce to nudging certain guests towards detrimental actions,
7040860	7045860	not safeguarding vulnerable individuals properly, and prioritising their business deals and spicy stories
7045860	7049860	over the actual wellbeing and autonomy of some of those who they covered.
7049860	7055860	Each allegation seemed to tell the same story, that although there seemed to be no active sabotage conducted by producers,
7055860	7059860	they pushed the responsibility of difficult decisions onto distressed guests to generate conflict,
7059860	7063860	which would then be touched on by the surly host, who would hold them accountable.
7064860	7069860	I have no excuse. I didn't want her to withdraw. I know that we did try and take her to the hospital,
7069860	7076860	and she ended up leaving. I don't have an answer for why I did what I did. I just wanted to help her feel better.
7076860	7079860	So you got the heroin, right? How did you take it?
7079860	7080860	Injected it.
7080860	7085860	So you bought heroin that she pumped into her veins, and therefore into the baby's veins.
7085860	7086860	Yes.
7086860	7088860	So that baby is high on heroin.
7088860	7091860	It's a very curious connection between many of the stories.
7091860	7095860	This is not one that people would necessarily consciously concoct to be consistent with other claims,
7095860	7100860	but they suggested that the Dr Phil Producers indulged a sweet spot between the show's responsibility,
7100860	7102860	and the guests' responsibility.
7102860	7105860	Sure, they didn't necessarily make these guest decisions for them,
7105860	7108860	but they put them in a position where many of them felt like they had no other option,
7108860	7112860	whether that's due to the unspoken dynamic, or the outwardly spoken words.
7112860	7116860	Even if it seems like they have a choice, it's almost its own illusion.
7116860	7118860	The presence of an audience makes this even more difficult,
7118860	7121860	because given almost all of them are likely to be in favour of Dr Phil,
7121860	7126860	try his ascent, and you're arguing against a hundred more people who have complete free reign to vocalise those feelings.
7126860	7129860	It's not hard to tell which side they're going to take.
7129860	7135860	We know the central narrative of a show like this will always aim to present Dr Phil lifting people out of a struggle.
7135860	7141860	He has to be their saviour, but they shouldn't have to manipulate scenarios to ensure that a person has a struggle to be lifted out of.
7142860	7147860	As their PR guru once said, those people were already encountering difficulties at the time that they arrived.
7147860	7151860	What happens at the show may not have too much of a direct bearing on those specific issues,
7151860	7154860	yet just because someone is suffering from a problem,
7154860	7159860	doesn't mean that an appearance on public television is just like any other Tuesday when addressing it.
7159860	7162860	That sort of show can be a make or break situation for a person's wellbeing.
7162860	7166860	You see, whereas Greenberg's statement was used to defer responsibility,
7166860	7168860	many would use it to bestow greater responsibility.
7168860	7174860	Just because someone is fighting their own personal battle doesn't mean you can't provide some reinforcements here or there,
7174860	7176860	and you have to make the best TV out of it.
7176860	7183860	Although they had established a prestige amongst many viewers as the show that provided the most sincere platform for people to share their struggles,
7183860	7187860	their set up enabled a bulletproof formula that would yield the results they wanted,
7187860	7192860	reaping the credit for everything that went right without making them too responsible for the things that went wrong,
7192860	7196860	exploiting nearly every medium possible to maximise their own success.
7196860	7203860	But in spite of its continued success, are the curtains finally coming down on this iconic daytime show?
7211860	7215860	The year is 2022, and Dr. Phil has been up and running for 20 seasons.
7215860	7221860	It has outlasted nearly every tabloid talk show, a majority of normal talk shows, including Oprah,
7221860	7223860	and still pulls significant viewership.
7223860	7225860	He must have done something right.
7225860	7230860	While in many ways, Dr. Phil achieved a feat unrivalled by nearly every other daytime show,
7230860	7236860	regardless of when or how it ends, it will have irrevocably changed many people's lives, for better and sometimes for worse.
7236860	7241860	McGraw has influenced multiple generations of people on how they may approach the topics of mental health,
7241860	7243860	and many other sensitive subjects surrounding the matter,
7243860	7247860	which is probably why people find the show such a hotbed for modern day discussion.
7247860	7251860	It's influenced how people seek help, put a face on a lot of unknown conditions,
7251860	7255860	and platformed important discussions that were often considered too taboo for mainstream television.
7275860	7279860	There's no doubt that many of those subjects covered by Dr. Phil will remain relevant for decades to come,
7279860	7285860	but will the man himself be at the forefront of it? With all that's been discussed today, I'm not entirely sure.
7285860	7291860	Dr. Phil's venture into the online community definitely gave him and the show a second wind that very few could have predicted.
7291860	7295860	It made him relevant with a new audience, and refreshed him in the memory of old ones.
7295860	7300860	However, success in the online world does come with the acknowledgement that you don't always have the control of public perception
7300860	7302860	that you might have on other mediums.
7302860	7307860	It didn't help that at its core, Dr. Phil was still old school syndicated television.
7307860	7311860	They didn't really adjust their rules depending on who was watching or talking about them.
7311860	7314860	Certain pursuits that became quite easy to criticise were picked up on,
7314860	7317860	and even though it was likely fairly standard procedure when the show was launched,
7317860	7323860	by this time people clearly realised there had to be somewhat more rigorous moral standards with the content he was producing,
7323860	7328860	and when he eventually got involved in the pinnacle of what every online figure dreads, drama,
7328860	7331860	his response was clearly taken from the TV template of admitting nothing.
7331860	7335860	The only problem was that it just wasn't believable at all.
7335860	7342860	In 2018, owing to its continued success, Dr. Phil was nude for an additional four seasons, running up until May 2023.
7342860	7346860	This was quite the feat all things considered, however, in the last couple years,
7346860	7351860	it has lost its syndicated crown to other shows, including Live with Kelly and Ryan and The View.
7351860	7357860	Now, this isn't to say the ratings still haven't been strong, Dr. Phil still pulls a significant viewership all things considered,
7357860	7363860	but whereas in March 2020 he was pulling a Nielsen rating of 2.8, by the end of 2021 that had dropped to 1.4,
7363860	7367860	and it seems somewhat uncertain if there will be a further extension to the show's lifespan.
7367860	7372860	On the basis of the numbers alone, I'd say they have reason to renew, however, on the basis of the trend,
7372860	7377860	I'd say they're probably aware of the risk. In August 2022, for the start of Season 21,
7377860	7382860	they laid off 25 staffers in a move to cut costs, and although the studio downplayed the move,
7382860	7387860	it's hard to ignore such significant downsizing, especially given the stories that had come out over the year before.
7387860	7392860	The only real piece of good news for the show came from the result of the lawsuit regarding Turnabout Ranch,
7392860	7395860	which Jones dismissed as ultimately not having strong enough grounds to pursue.
7395860	7400860	Having probably the most TV company move of them all, the response of the Dr. Phil show was to request the court
7400860	7405860	to have the former guest, Archer Letter, pay them $400,000 in legal fees,
7405860	7408860	which seems just a bit tasteless considering the sensitivity of the case,
7408860	7412860	and the fact that a separate lawsuit against Turnabout Ranch has yet to be concluded.
7412860	7418860	But that's just my take, I could point towards one specific story and say that it was the straw that broke the camel's back,
7418860	7423860	but really, I think it's just the result of gradual attrition, a formula being worn to the bone,
7423860	7426860	and people finally realising it wasn't the TV that it claimed to be.
7426860	7430860	I think that back in the day, when it was competing with shows that regularly skewered their guests
7430860	7435860	and made the grandest spectacle of each situation, Dr. Phil could be that more humane alternative.
7435860	7440860	With the rise of the internet, and Dr. Phil's own participation in it, they found themselves out of step
7440860	7444860	with more refined documentaries, and psychological analyses of situations by credited experts
7444860	7448860	who treat these topics with much more reverence than Dr. Phil ever did.
7448860	7452860	McGraw's show still has the edge in the fact that it often directly involves these subjects,
7452860	7455860	and the fact that they can actually offer treatment and coverage of such,
7455860	7458860	but that has been overshadowed by the questions surrounding a lot of these treatment centres,
7458860	7461860	and Dr. Phil's own relationship with them.
7461860	7464860	YouTubers who worked with counselling site BetterHelp came under criticism
7464860	7468860	after the company found themselves mired in controversy regarding the status of some professionals,
7468860	7472860	and some creators were thought to have not actually used the site they were promoting.
7472860	7476860	That is a drop in the ocean compared to what McGraw has appeared to greenlight.
7476860	7481860	Lawsuit regarding Turnabout Ranch has also further torn a hole in that previously impenetrable reputation.
7481860	7486860	Although lawsuits were not necessarily anything new to Dr. Phil, and certainly this result wasn't,
7486860	7489860	the media coverage, the names attached, and the possible precedent that could have been set
7489860	7492860	if they had found McGraw and his crew culpable for their recommendation
7492860	7495860	is enough to give many studios cold feet.
7495860	7499860	This probably wouldn't have even been conceivable when the show started up in the early 2000s,
7499860	7504860	with TV the medium, and guests making one or two appearances before being forgotten in the run of episodes.
7504860	7509860	With the online world immortalising much of this content, mostly the behest of Dr. Phil's production team,
7509860	7512860	their strength of reaching a new audience is also that vulnerability.
7512860	7517860	Like a lot of TV shows, and even media in general, Dr. Phil was ahead of its time when it made its debut,
7517860	7520860	but has fallen behind the evolving zeitgeist of the years have passed,
7520860	7524860	and it seems too resistant to the change it would need to undertake to overcome that.
7524860	7528860	Maybe Phil's format just wasn't capable of something more human,
7528860	7531860	or maybe it was, but wasn't prepared to make that change.
7531860	7536860	I believe I can bring him really quality help, and I think he can respond to that,
7536860	7539860	and I think he probably will.
7539860	7544860	In principle, I don't think it would be completely impossible to overhaul the current system in place.
7544860	7548860	However, I think the issue is that when a show becomes so established over a long period of time,
7548860	7553860	it digs its roots in which makes it very difficult for certain changes to be affected.
7553860	7557860	The additional problem is that your remaining audience may only be comfortable with your current format,
7557860	7561860	so even if your numbers are down currently, you still risk distancing the law of viewers
7561860	7565860	by completely renovating the show that so many of those viewers have come to appreciate.
7565860	7568860	But is it radical to ask for a bit more humanity?
7568860	7573860	Arguably, much of what we discuss today wouldn't necessarily require that many adjustments,
7573860	7576860	just a heightened sensitivity and improved safeguarding.
7576860	7579860	However, even that may be a bit too much for a show that at its core,
7579860	7583860	still thrived on the drama that it superficially seemed to seek distance from.
7583860	7587860	And to be brutally honest, maybe that's what people wanted.
7592860	7594860	We've discussed this in the past with the Ellen video,
7594860	7597860	but one of the aspects of a modern talk show that appeals to so many people
7597860	7602860	is this thought that what you're receiving is an unfiltered, authentic version of a person.
7602860	7604860	Unfortunately, Hollywood ruins most things,
7604860	7608860	and for studios, it often seems easier to manufacture the illusion of an authentic atmosphere
7608860	7610860	than to actually craft one organically.
7610860	7613860	Yet if people are none the wiser to this assembly, then who can it harm?
7613860	7617860	Well in principle, it doesn't have to harm anyone if it's managed correctly.
7617860	7621860	The problem is that a formula based on deception doesn't tend to attract the most sincere characters,
7621860	7625860	and when you're dealing with topics like mental health, there tends to be more at stake.
7625860	7628860	You can't blame audiences for only seeing what they want to see,
7628860	7632860	because in truth, they often only see what the TV producers want to see.
7632860	7636860	But anything catered to being more realistic would probably undermine the studio's version
7636860	7639860	of how authentic such TV shows should appear.
7639860	7642860	Every show has an angle, because it's what sells.
7642860	7645860	Dr. Phil was often presented as a selfless endeavour,
7645860	7649860	an altruistic drive to help people beat their demons and get their lives back on track.
7649860	7652860	Finally, a format for a show based around the needs of a guest.
7652860	7657860	However, I think over time it became clear to audiences that it wasn't exactly about helping,
7657860	7659860	it was more about people believing you're helping.
7659860	7662860	We've already addressed how cameras affect the guests on the show,
7662860	7664860	but the cameras also affect Dr. Phil,
7664860	7667860	and when they were rolling, people received a seemingly measured and earnest persona,
7667860	7669860	but a persona nonetheless.
7669860	7673860	This was a one-man franchise, anything that threatened that image was quickly dispatched on.
7673860	7675860	Good morning to you, Ty.
7675860	7676860	Hey, Bump Fights, baby.
7676860	7678860	Is that a wig you're wearing?
7678860	7679860	No, real hair.
7679860	7685860	Real hair, just curious, because I understand you're not using your real name, and I wonder why that is.
7685860	7690860	Well, no, Ty Beast is my real name, I'm a film student out of USC,
7690860	7695860	and it took three years to put together the footage for the Bump Fights, and now it's out.
7695860	7697860	And now the police come calling.
7697860	7700860	Well, I'm not worried about it, I don't think I've done anything wrong.
7700860	7703860	It's been a long video, but I do have one more story for you.
7703860	7707860	Yes, an incident that has acquired internet fame allegedly involving the creator of Bump Fights,
7707860	7712860	Ty Beaston, is often pointed to by critics as a perfect example of what we're discussing today.
7712860	7719860	Now, I have to warn you, some of this footage that you're about to see is clearly inappropriate for young viewers.
7719860	7722860	Please ask your children to leave the room, and I'm serious,
7722860	7728860	you really don't want your kids watching this, and it's not gonna be fun for you to see it.
7728860	7734860	But we have to be aware of what's floating around out there, and what our kids have access to.
7734860	7741860	Bump Fights is a rather grim series of films designed to exploit homeless people by making them participate in often quite dangerous antics,
7741860	7745860	and so it made sense that they would be subject to criticism from someone like McGraw,
7745860	7749860	who would obviously find such content abhorrent on the grounds of its inhumanity.
7749860	7753860	This seemed like the perfect opportunity to pick someone apart for their actions.
7753860	7754860	And yet...
7754860	7758860	I've made multi-millions off the Bump Fights video series.
7758860	7761860	I'm not surprised at my success. It's a sick world.
7761860	7764860	Stop the tape. Stop the tape.
7764860	7766860	I don't want to talk to you.
7766860	7767860	Why not?
7767860	7770860	That's despicable. I don't want to talk to you.
7770860	7777860	I just watched that footage, and that is absolutely despicable, and I refuse to publicise that.
7777860	7784860	In the moment, it seemed that McGraw, so roused by the content he watched, had made an active decision to not indulge this heartless troll,
7784860	7787860	a harrowing moment of principle from the Doctor himself.
7787860	7793860	He creates this stance, as it's a matter that is clearly very personal to him, as he said he has been homeless too.
7793860	7796860	Yet, he's interviewed worse people, hasn't he?
7796860	7799860	I mean, what is so exceptional about this guy?
7800860	7807860	If you think I exploit people, every time you bring a guest on this show, you exploit them and spread whatever problems they have to the whole world.
7807860	7809860	You think that's helping them?
7809860	7811860	Yeah, keep telling yourself that. You can go.
7811860	7814860	Ah well, you see, he's dressed in rather interesting attire.
7814860	7818860	You could go as far as to say him and Dr. Phil, but practically matching suits.
7818860	7821860	As that clip just illustrated, it wasn't done without purpose.
7821860	7827860	As a matter of fact, it seems Beeson wanted to take the opportunity to make a you and I ain't so different type speech.
7827860	7831860	Now, I would say that Bum Fights is somewhat worse than Dr. Phil on the basis of its premise,
7831860	7834860	and I think McGraw could have made that case for himself,
7834860	7839860	but clearly anticipating that it's an argument he does not want to have, he pulls the plug on the interview.
7839860	7842860	Now, this isn't exactly an admission that Beeson is in fact correct,
7842860	7847860	but for a man who is so sure-footed on the narratives he propounds and the judgments he makes on other people,
7847860	7849860	you'd think he'd be at least able to stand up for himself,
7849860	7854860	and yet he can't even answer to the creator or one of the most philistine forms of modern media.
7854860	7859860	If it truly was a matter that caused McGraw to feel so strongly to the point where he didn't want to give this guy the time of day,
7859860	7861860	he shouldn't have let him on the show in the first place.
7861860	7867860	Dismissing the guy when he was actively there before he could even say anything was probably the most cowardly thing to do.
7867860	7872860	Phil saw this guy coming and realised it wasn't going to be your usual dunking.
7872860	7876860	If it was truly about the people that Dr. Phil sought to help or address,
7876860	7880860	he would have no reservations going toe to toe with some of the most questionable figures in modern culture,
7881860	7883860	like a lot of the old talk show hosts from the 60s.
7883860	7889860	But it's always a question of control for McGraw, and they can't afford an episode which even makes him look remotely out of his depth.
7889860	7896860	There has to be a predictability about how these guests are going to behave so that McGraw can assert control over the situation,
7896860	7899860	so that if they concur with him, they're engaging positively with his narrative,
7899860	7904860	or if they are so bold to try and detract from them, the show has a way to discredit what they say,
7904860	7907860	whether they're young, intoxicated, or just mentally unstable.
7907860	7911860	The last part I requested more humanity, but humanity is a two-way street,
7911860	7916860	and to require more humanity from the show would require more humanity from Dr. Phil,
7916860	7922860	and I think it's just too much to ask from a show that has prided itself on having a superhuman host.
7922860	7924860	After all, he's just a little sensitive.
7925860	7930860	It's the love story of the century, but you've never physically met.
7930860	7935860	No, sir. And y'all can laugh at me. Fine. I will be your spectacle. I will be your laughing, laughing spectacle.
7935860	7936860	You can all laugh at me. It's fine.
7936860	7938860	Well, you know what? I think we're just going to shut this down,
7938860	7943860	because I'm not into all this melodrama and you playing the victim and everything,
7943860	7948860	so you're saying the audience is making a spectacle out of you.
7948860	7950860	That's not what I'm about. That's not what I do.
7950860	7956860	I had you come here to help you, and you're saying people are ridiculed, making fun of you,
7956860	7959860	you're going to be a spectacle. I don't want to be any part of that.
7959860	7962860	I used the word Messiah earlier, and I 100% meant it.
7962860	7968860	Dr. Phil's show is structured off making the title character seem like that savior at any and all costs,
7968860	7973860	that he is right, but the truth is that nobody, not even a therapist, can fulfill that image,
7973860	7977860	and any show that provides that impression is not being honest with its guests or its audience.
7977860	7979860	The problem is that when you successfully sell that image,
7979860	7984860	not only are you selling an unrealistic expectation of therapy to millions of people,
7984860	7988860	you aren't creating a fair environment for a struggling guest to actually find the support they need.
7988860	7993860	It means that any actual treatment doesn't have to be catered to the individual, more to a show's agenda,
7993860	7998860	and if it doesn't work, you can push responsibility onto the guests for not being receptive enough.
7998860	8001860	It's the Seymour Skinner complex that asks you whether your form of therapy didn't work,
8001860	8004860	and then concluding that it must be the patient who's wrong.
8004860	8009860	It's built off this idea purported to audiences that it's Dr. Phil offering a service to these people,
8009860	8012860	when in reality, it's quite the opposite.
8012860	8015860	This has just gone in a really bad direction.
8015860	8018860	I'm going to talk with Jasmine, I'm going to talk with your mother,
8018860	8024860	and I'm just going to let you head on home and go, because I'm not going to play-
8024860	8027860	Is there anything I can say to fix this? I'm so sorry.
8027860	8032860	No, no, all of this melodrama about ridiculing the audience and they can laugh at you and all that,
8032860	8039860	I don't play those kind of games. You're very manipulative, and I just, I'm not interested in all of that.
8039860	8043860	Although there would be no show without cameras, and no narrative without the producers,
8043860	8046860	there would be no Dr. Phil without the guests.
8046860	8051860	They provide the show with years of timeless stories, and harrowing accounts, receiving very little from it in return.
8051860	8057860	Their benefit, the hope for recovery, which really should be provided regardless of financial incentive,
8057860	8060860	is the least they deserved, and sometimes that wasn't even viable.
8060860	8064860	There are so many people, famous celebrities, enshrined through the lens of modern media,
8064860	8069860	who could be picked out at their weakest point, and put under that Dr. Phil microscope,
8069860	8073860	and the man himself is no exception.
8082860	8087860	Cancel culture, it's a phrase that's been used in online circles to nauseating degrees.
8087860	8090860	I don't want to go too much into detail about it right now,
8090860	8095860	but it's difficult to even give a basic rundown of the definition because there are so many interpretations of it,
8095860	8098860	to the point where some people don't even believe it exists.
8098860	8103860	I think mainly because this sphere of discussion is dominated by super celebrities who are almost immune
8103860	8105860	to ever having their voices silenced anyway.
8105860	8110860	However, our good friend Dr. Phil McGraw has been an outspoken critic of it,
8110860	8113860	appearing on interviews to call out the harmfulness of the culture,
8113860	8117860	but speaking is one thing, does his show reflect that philosophy?
8117860	8120860	Well, to many, cancel culture seems like a new phenomenon,
8120860	8124860	and the presence of mob mentality online definitely highlights his failings,
8124860	8128860	but in many cases, I think it's just a repackaging of something that's long existed,
8128860	8131860	and it's not something that affects everybody equally.
8131860	8136860	We are in a bubble, we don't want to talk to anyone that doesn't agree with our thinking,
8136860	8142860	and if someone says something that is offensive to our sensibilities, then people go on the attack,
8142860	8149860	and they may choose a wrong word, and instead of saying, you know, maybe messaging them in some way,
8149860	8154860	saying, hey listen, you may not know it, but that could be offensive to someone,
8154860	8160860	instead they start bombarding them with boycott messages telling them they hope they die,
8160860	8165860	I'm going to slit your throat in the night, I hate, I mean just horrible things.
8165860	8169860	In 1988, when McGraw was actually working as a psychologist,
8169860	8174860	he was reprimanded and penalised for hiring a former patient of his for part-time employment.
8174860	8178860	The patient in question also made claims suggesting inappropriate contact by McGraw,
8178860	8182860	however, the board's review did not conclude in the patient's favour on that front.
8182860	8186860	For now, I'm not going to comment on that which is disputed, and there are other serious claims against him
8186860	8189860	that are tied up in legal proceedings which I won't be exploring today,
8189860	8195860	however, I will say that it is Therapy 101 that you do not develop a personal or business relationship
8195860	8197860	with one of your patients outside of your practice.
8197860	8202860	It's not a healthy dynamic, and the fact that someone seemingly as stoic as McGraw could allow that to happen
8202860	8206860	is certainly a stark reminder that TV hosts are not all they represent sometimes.
8206860	8212860	Now, that's over 30 years ago, and I think one of the uglier aspects of cancer culture is ruining someone's career
8212860	8217860	for historic indiscretions. I believe that broadly speaking, people deserve the chance to grow and change,
8217860	8220860	and that ruining someone's livelihood is seldom the solution.
8220860	8226860	In his case, the board's solution was for McGraw to be supervised until they were satisfied that their conditions were met.
8226860	8230860	To many, this would seem like a fair and proportional response from the board. Would Dr. Phil agree?
8230860	8237860	McGraw has been outspoken on the benefits of his show, and even that he believes it's a fair basis for conflict resolution.
8237860	8241860	So all I'd ask is this, if McGraw genuinely believes in his own approach to therapy,
8241860	8247860	would he have subjected himself to it when he found himself facing serious criticism in 1988?
8247860	8251860	Although I can't look inside his mind, my prediction would be a resounding no.
8251860	8257860	Why? Because he knows better than anyone that you have very little control over how you're going to be perceived or presented.
8257860	8263860	Dr. Phil emphasizes responsibility, but when you as a person have no control over what the TV producers do,
8263860	8269860	what Dr. Phil says, or how your own words may even be twisted and used against you, you can't be responsible for that,
8269860	8273860	yet you'll believe it because you were the person who chose to go on the show in the first place.
8273860	8277860	Audiences can pretend to be better, but if the performance of YouTube videos tell us anything,
8277860	8281860	it's that people are much more interested in the deterioration than they are the recovery.
8281860	8285860	People are going to be remembered online for decades for often their lowest points in their life,
8285860	8291860	will likely be judged for behaviour they may have long corrected, even though in hindsight, the flaws of these shows seemed abundantly clear.
8291860	8295860	Most of the longest running shows in this genre, like Springer, Carl, and even Jones,
8295860	8297860	were often the most provocative and controversial.
8297860	8302860	Many of them were rather gross, relied on stereotypes and tropes related to people's backgrounds or identity,
8302860	8308860	and if the same formula was applied with more subtlety with Dr. Phil, it would hardly be surprising as it seems inbuilt with the genre.
8308860	8314860	Even beyond the concept alone, the numerous allegations that Dr. Phil producers went out of their way to make people seem worse
8314860	8320860	than they actually were on screen, isn't that the core of said culture that McGraw would decry in interviews?
8320860	8325860	You see, although I think in many ways, provocative hosts were likely detrimental to guests during their TV appearances,
8325860	8330860	it at least gave audiences some idea of how responsibility can be shared in these situations.
8330860	8336860	I don't think most people are emotionally unintelligent, I think they can recognise when a frenzied situation arises,
8336860	8341860	and it's hard to control. Dr. Phil, on the other hand, built up Randolph being the reasonable guy,
8341860	8345860	and it's ingenious optics really, because I think in appearing measured and reasonable,
8345860	8350860	he succeeds in making his guests, who are often put on the spot, look much rather like the opposite,
8350860	8355860	and if the allegations are true, then in many ways, they were much more insidious in their technique than many other hosts
8355860	8358860	who were outwardly, on the surface, more objectionable.
8358860	8364860	Everyone looks at social media as the sole cause of cancellation, but TV has been cancelling people for decades,
8364860	8369860	whether that be their social standing amongst their peers, or the lives that have been lost due to it.
8369860	8376860	It's happened to high profile people who have been forgotten, and low profile people who as far as most of us know, never existed.
8376860	8381860	The internet certainly amplifies elements of it, and it's not healthy, but a lot of people have been looking down
8381860	8386860	on these people struggling before the internet ever began to have any sort of influence in these people's lives.
8386860	8391860	The only way you can come out a winner in the eyes of the audience is if you cooperate with a show's narrative,
8391860	8395860	and let the help they offer change you for the better, places like Turnabout.
8395860	8398860	It's not authentic though, and some people will fall at that hurdle.
8398860	8404860	It's not their fault that an aggressive form of therapy wasn't for them, but the show will sure make it seem like it.
8404860	8411860	Framing is everything, we live in an era where people seem to empathise more with fictional characters than real people because of it.
8411860	8417860	TV series like Barry or Better Call Saul are far superior psychological analyses of complex characters,
8417860	8422860	and sure, it's hard to find people like that for a tabloid talk show, and you might not want to,
8422860	8428860	but when there are shows that contextualise mass murderers and the literal devil better than you can a drug addicted teen,
8428860	8431860	then maybe you're doing something wrong, and once these people are off your show,
8431860	8437860	they can do very little to change that image in an industry that favours large companies with lawyers on retainer.
8437860	8439860	Everyone's an actor when they know a camera's on.
8440860	8441860	Daily, how are you?
8441860	8442860	Um, not good.
8442860	8443860	Yeah, why's that?
8443860	8447860	I was told that y'all brought someone here that I explicitly said not to bring.
8447860	8448860	Yeah, who's that?
8448860	8450860	Um, my biological mother.
8450860	8451860	Would you like to leave?
8451860	8452860	Um.
8452860	8458860	Cause you can certainly leave, cause nobody tells me who to put on my show, including you.
8458860	8459860	Times are changing though.
8459860	8464860	You're on the beaten days where you'd be thrown off or torn apart if you had anything to say against McGraw.
8464860	8470860	People who have been subject to grilling on these shows find themselves with a greater platform to finally express their own perspectives,
8470860	8474860	ones that would never have been broadcast elsewhere because they didn't fit the narrative.
8474860	8477860	People like Bregoli, whose case would have otherwise been lost to the sands of time,
8477860	8483860	have been able to use their former notoriety to actually amplify their own voice in discussing their experience on the show,
8483860	8485860	and the subsequent treatment they were subjected to.
8485860	8487860	Someone like Commentators followed suit.
8487860	8491860	YouTuber Jaco has released a very compelling set of videos covering many of these scandals,
8491860	8495860	which I definitely recommend, with further strong contributions coming from many corners of the internet.
8495860	8500860	It's very valiant for Dr. Phil to start discussing cancel culture now in the way that he has,
8500860	8506860	but one can't help thinking where this discussion was when he was publicly roasting parents for not raising children
8506860	8510860	as he thought they should in front of millions of viewers, and roasting those children too.
8510860	8516860	I don't know what he thinks is so different about the online world that makes his core specifically so righteous.
8516860	8524860	Well, guys, it's time for you each to take responsibility for what part of this you own,
8524860	8532860	and Diane, you're blaming Ron, and Ron, you're blaming Diane, but let me assure you, nobody,
8532860	8538860	nobody is responsible for your feelings and your actions but yourself.
8538860	8544860	It's ironic, what could prove to be the Achilles heel of Dr. Phil may be the very responsibility
8544860	8550860	that McGraw has continuously advocated for. Once again, one can't help wonder what he would say to himself now
8550860	8554860	if he was a guest on his own show, so I guess I'll say it to him.
8554860	8560860	Yes, cancel culture is real and can genuinely harm decent people trying to better themselves,
8560860	8566860	I'm glad you care about it, but it's a culture that everyone, yourself included, has participated in at some point in their lives.
8566860	8572860	Suddenly taking an interest when people have become capable of calling you out seems a bit too coincidental.
8572860	8577860	I know it's a trending topic right now, and obviously the phrase has helped amplify the discussion surrounding it,
8577860	8582860	but most of Phil's discourse centres around people who clearly haven't been cancelled, alongside interviews with pop culture
8582860	8586860	and political loudmouths who use these narratives to actually increase their influence.
8586860	8594860	I can't believe how my fellow liberals are behaving, what is liberal about cancelling everybody and anything
8594860	8597860	that you don't happen to agree with? It's a complete nonsense.
8597860	8601860	Listen, there's been attempts to cancel me before cancel culture was a thing.
8601860	8604860	I'm an outspoken conservative, that's something that I'm used to.
8604860	8609860	A lot of large celebrities seem to conflate ordinary people having a platform to respond to them,
8609860	8616860	maybe sometimes rather unpleasantly, with actual threats to their careers, when in many cases they'll never experience that.
8616860	8621860	There are examples where shows and institutes have been pressured to drop certain public figures,
8621860	8624860	and those reasons have been tenuous or driven by personal vendettas.
8625860	8631860	I have never agreed with that, and I am broadly a free speech person, but even then it seldom targets celebrities,
8631860	8635860	often academics, smaller companies, those who can't actually afford to fight for themselves.
8635860	8640860	Dr Phil can, it's clear that he has, and it's clear that he will continue to.
8640860	8645860	However, his takes on cancel culture aren't those of a psychologist, they're those of someone who simply
8645860	8650860	isn't as untouchable as they previously were, but sometimes that is for the best.
8650860	8656860	Just like the psychology board's verdict, in 1988 wasn't cancel culture, neither is this.
8662860	8667860	At the start of the video, I posed a simple question that was likely being asked by many ambitious producers
8667860	8669860	at the time of Dr Phil's first appearance on TV.
8669860	8675860	If we combine a talk show host with a specialist in a specific academic area, what would the result be?
8675860	8680860	Well, obviously, Dr Phil is only one possible outcome, but from this one little case study,
8680860	8685860	I'd say that it yielded an impressive, yet hollow spectacle, one that flaunted all the credentials
8685860	8690860	of our servant in question, but had no way to effectively utilize it in a format that maintained a balance
8690860	8695860	between entertainment and humanity, instead leaning into the former at the expense of the latter,
8695860	8699860	in pursuit of those ratings, but I suppose that's not necessarily a surprise.
8699860	8704860	It's what these studios know best, and anything that may allow the competition to have an edge over them
8704860	8708860	should be considered as fair game. It's the survival of the fittest environment,
8708860	8712860	and it's what keeps a lot of people in their jobs, however, just because it's the natural thing to do,
8712860	8716860	it's the right thing to do, and over time, as people's moral compasses have adjusted,
8716860	8720860	the format of Dr Phil has become unpalatable with more and more viewers.
8720860	8725860	Combined with some allegations that completely contradict the image that Dr Phil would claim to reject,
8725860	8728860	and the continued poor responses made by employees and even McGraw himself,
8728860	8732860	it's not a surprise that some people are switching off, or switching over.
8732860	8737860	Dr Phil taught many how to sympathize with those struggling, but now people are working out how to empathize with them as well.
8737860	8742860	Dr Phil taught many how to seek out help, but now many are learning that there are different types of help,
8742860	8749860	and that there's never a one-size-fits-all solution. In both cases, it makes Dr Phil's approach seem a little outdated.
8749860	8753860	People's understanding of mental health has evolved greatly in the last couple decades, and I'm glad.
8753860	8757860	We're garnering a greater understanding of the challenges and troubles that people face.
8757860	8763860	Although we still have a long way to go, I think many have begun to understand how public therapy is a bit of an oxymoron.
8763860	8769860	It's a difficult topic to navigate, and Dr Phil has likely put a fair few conversations surrounding mental health on the map.
8769860	8772860	I don't want to void him of any credit whatsoever.
8772860	8776860	We want to live in a world where these topics aren't too difficult to address and pay attention to,
8776860	8781860	but we also need to make sure that those people who may be the centre of the discourse can at least represent themselves how they wish to,
8781860	8786860	free of narratives that wish to box them in or present a third party as the hero of the situation.
8786860	8791860	Dr Phil didn't steal the limelight completely for himself, but it's natural for a TV show to bolster their reputation
8791860	8795860	by crediting themselves for the positive stories and outcomes of guests who have appeared on there,
8795860	8801860	people saying thank you Dr Phil, and viewers clapping while he strolls around because it's just another day at the office for him,
8801860	8806860	and I think the contrast of blaming the guests when something doesn't work out creates a very unsavoury juxtaposition.
8806860	8812860	Although there are lots of people and factors that can aid a person's recovery, it's you who has made those changes,
8812860	8815860	and you should never let anyone take that credit away from you.
8815860	8821860	It's not easy, it's a minefield of shit to navigate that may occasionally challenge you to confront bad habits,
8821860	8827860	but even if it's entirely your fault that you landed yourself in shit in the first place and you're merely going back to where you started from,
8827860	8829860	it's still worthy of recognition.
8829860	8835860	Although it's not the entire story, I do think that to make stories more centred around the people who are actually encountering these struggles,
8835860	8841860	you have to decentralise the system that covers these stories, and that's antithetical to the nature of a talk show.
8841860	8849860	That's why I think Dr Phil is probably too rigid to make that change, because they'd probably have to scrap the one thing that appealed to audiences in the first place,
8849860	8857860	Dr Phil himself. He's a knowledgeable and intelligent individual, but he's part of a system that has fallen behind what a lot of people are looking for,
8857860	8864860	and how long he can retain his viewership amongst a manifestation of claims and lawsuits that seem to have greater media presence than ever
8864860	8866860	is a question that will only be revealed with time.
8866860	8873860	Maybe if Dr Phil does come to an end, we will have some clarity on what happened behind the scenes from people who no longer have a commitment to the show,
8873860	8875860	but who knows when that's going to happen.
8875860	8882860	It's unclear what the future of the Dr Phil show has in store, but whether it continues for another 20 years or isn't renewed past 2023,
8882860	8888860	it's legacy is definitely going to be the source of debate for time to come. However, there are some judgements that can be made.
8888860	8894860	At its best, the producers of Dr Phil didn't properly make sure their guests stayed in a safe place as they should have,
8894860	8900860	and at their worst, they could have exposed guests to the very vices they were claiming to remedy, very possibly intentionally.
8900860	8905860	Now, in most cases, Dr Phil did provide care for people after their appearance, though there are obvious exceptions.
8905860	8910860	However, is the help that comes after worth the humiliation and conflict that comes during?
8910860	8915860	It's a question worth asking, particularly when that help was structured around its own business model,
8915860	8923860	whether that meant shipping celebrities off to facilities and specific places, or sending children to boarding schools or treatment centres in different states.
8924860	8935860	Well, it's hard to believe that 21 years ago I made my very first appearance on the Oprah show, and together we launched Dr Phil in 2002.
8935860	8940860	And it does sadden me in a way, because in watching a lot of episodes, I have seen the positive changes made by the show.
8940860	8947860	I have seen people genuinely find the help they need, I have seen some really harrowing interviews with people who have been through hell.
8947860	8951860	Dr Phil isn't this universal negative, and I don't want to make it out to be that,
8951860	8955860	but it is a product of an era that isn't as human as it needs to be.
8955860	8960860	I said at the start that as preached on the show, the first step to making a change in your life is acknowledging responsibility,
8960860	8967860	something that many of us have done, but something that many of these shows seem to be allergic to, possibly for legal reasons, I don't know for sure.
8967860	8974860	Maybe for that reason, they'll never evolve, but I do want to give some words of advice in the instance that that is something they're interested in.
8974860	8979860	If it wants to at least try and keep up with the changing zeitgeist, there needs to be changes.
8979860	8986860	This isn't 2002 anymore, there should be more diligence about how guests are treated on and off the show, and how the show presents their stories.
8986860	8992860	They shouldn't let guests put themselves at risk with substances and alcohol in their care, regardless of the TV that it may engender.
8992860	8996860	They shouldn't crucify teens and youngsters because they're behaving badly.
8996860	9001860	If they want to make a positive difference, put some money aside towards their treatment, and protect their identities a little better.
9002860	9010860	They're troubled as anyone, and crafting narratives about how they're the offspring from hell only boxes in their image and challenges them to rebel at one of the most rebellious points in their lives.
9010860	9015860	How they can think that helps is beyond me, and it's definitely something that needs to change in my opinion.
9015860	9018860	Whether they choose to take that advice is their decision.
9018860	9022860	I'm sure McGraw and all will be living alright either way if their net worth is anything to go by,
9022860	9027860	but if they also care about the wellbeing of their guests, it might just be worth considering.
9027860	9031860	Doctor Phil McGraw, and all those behind Doctor Phil, did something unprecedented.
9031860	9037860	They took tabloid talk shows to the next level, and showed many in the genre that there could be a more dignified element,
9037860	9041860	but not every episode had to end with some sort of route.
9041860	9048860	However, by holding on to some of the more tabloid aspects of the original formula, they eventually fell into the same pitfalls that many other shows of their time had.
9048860	9056860	Where they'll be remembered for those pitfalls, or their success stories, is something only time will tell, and maybe they still have time to change that.
9056860	9062860	But it's something whose extent we'll probably only fully know when Doctor Phil is cancelled.
9062860	9068860	The show that is, not the person. You know, that was the pun. I'm really funny.
9074860	9082860	So yeah, that was the video. Hope you enjoyed. Took a bit to come together, but did come together in the end, and that's what matters.
9083860	9091860	Not too much to discuss today, but I did want to mention one thing. Currently, we're doing a little charity thing on the merchandise website.
9091860	9097860	Selling some items. Obviously, Christmas is a lovely time for a lot of people, but not for everyone.
9097860	9101860	My mother put some nice designs together, and we thought, why not?
9101860	9108860	So with some of these charity jobs, obviously there is the concern that others are taking a cut, and obviously there are costs for the production of the shirts.
9108860	9115860	What I'm going to do is donate the difference, so that how much you pay for the products is how much is being donated.
9115860	9120860	And you get something for it as well, which may have some utility in your life.
9120860	9127860	It's better than buying the new lad baby single. And for the Americans who do not understand their reference, ignorance is bliss, my friends.
9127860	9129860	Ignorance is bliss.
9129860	9136860	I'd also like to thank the editors. Credits will be in the pinned comment below. I said description last time, I'm not sure why.
