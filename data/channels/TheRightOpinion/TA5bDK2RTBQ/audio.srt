00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,420
Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time.

2
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:24,680
A mainstream TV, a contraption that, contrary to release held by many netizens, people do actually still watch.

3
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:31,040
Sharks, advanced sports technology is at the forefront of a new sport that's sweeping the entire nation like a tidal wave.

4
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:35,640
Sharks, this is the National Association of Bubble Soccer.

5
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:50,040
It's not a necessity in modern day society, with the rise of online content and streaming platforms,

6
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,160
you can obtain your daily dose of entertainment from a variety of sources.

7
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:57,880
Yet, although audiences have certainly been spoiled with an abundance of TV series and films,

8
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:03,280
many live shows have still predominantly remained on broadcast television, well, at least more than others.

9
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:10,120
These include game shows, news programs, and of course, today's genre that has launched so many successful careers, talk shows.

10
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:30,680
Now, this isn't to say they don't have their online counterparts, but I think like other shows that retain most of their audience from live TV broadcast,

11
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:38,320
there is something about watching that sort of content in the moment, as it often operates within a very brief window into the spirit of that specific era.

12
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:44,120
If you went back and tried to watch an episode of Oprah from 1992, you'd probably find it hasn't dated the best.

13
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:47,360
I mean, sometimes these episodes are dated by the time they're released.

14
00:01:53,160 --> 00:02:00,400
I digress though, to give them their credit, they have fought hard for their place on the TV Guide,

15
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:07,520
and they do provide people with content that can keep them in touch with the world around them through a medium that may be more digestible than the traditional outlets.

16
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,400
With this in mind, there aren't too many set rules for creating a successful talk show.

17
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:16,560
The first rule is that there needs to be some talking, that kind of goes without saying, or with saying I suppose,

18
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:22,520
but it's also important that the person talking is relatively interesting, and has a personality to present those viewing.

19
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:28,040
The second rule is that there needs to be people to talk to, otherwise the host is just rambling into the void.

20
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:36,280
Therefore, they'll either talk to you, the viewer, directly, or there's a live audience drafted into cheer, jeer, or appear as part of the host's wacky shenanigans.

21
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:45,920
With such a broad church of TV encompassed by these couple tenets, it's no surprise that a plethora of shows have garnered success of the very diverse interpretations of these couple key tenets,

22
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:51,480
from the preppy positivity of Ellen, to the necessary conflict and consequent chaos of a show like The View.

23
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:55,960
We just said we don't scream at each other, right? Or is it just you that gets to scream?

24
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,960
Okay, no, no, I agree.

25
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:04,160
Okay, then lower your voice, because we are very close to each other, and I know you come here to sell a book and try to pick a fight, but we're not going to do it today.

26
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:11,600
Nevertheless, it follows that such a wide-reaching genre would spawn numerous sub-genres, many of whom have their own means of engagement and corresponding audiences.

27
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:20,360
While the most significant that arose during the 90s was a star called tabloid talk shows, a controversial and divisive genre that utilized the concept of guest involvement to the maximum.

28
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:27,440
It soon dawned on TV producers that hosts weren't the only people who could be interesting, and that could serve a purpose as well.

29
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:32,240
Can you say this, you dumb bitch? Can you read the f***ing line, you stupid bitch?

30
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,240
What are you talking about? What is this?

31
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,240
What do you mean you can replace, bitch?

32
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:46,680
In the years following, a lot of these shows cropped up that broadcast what would normally be extremely personal disputes, and the explosive confrontations that would follow from them.

33
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:53,280
Add in many people's desire for their five minutes for fame, and orchestration designed to heighten tension between the parties involved,

34
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,320
and you were often left with highly theatrical, yet extremely real coverage of interpersonal troubles.

35
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,680
For some it was entertaining, but for others it was unwatchable.

36
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:11,400
Enter stage left Oprah Winfrey, the queen of TV talk shows, who some argue made the industry more accessible to tabloid shows due to the intimate nature of her own.

37
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:17,320
Her often very personal statements and opinions through the guise of a large media personality caught a lot of people's attention.

38
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:28,240
With that said, Oprah was also thought to not be entirely comfortable with that presentation, and sought to retain a more conventional and professional structure that wouldn't conflate her with an often turbulent genre.

39
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:35,400
One of these measures undertaken was to involve experts in certain segments, and provide an extra veneer of credibility for the discourse at hand.

40
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:40,760
One of these experts was an individual by the name of Phil McGraw, who held a PhD in clinical psychology.

41
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:49,960
Oprah had met Phil a few years prior while working with his trial consultancy firm CSI, after being sued for statements she had made on her show relating to mad cow disease.

42
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:59,240
After that beef was settled, she offered McGraw a visiting spot on Oprah, where he would be brought on to discuss questions surrounding relationships and general life hardships with her guests.

43
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:05,480
With their focus being on the host, a lot of shows experimented with different styles, and not too soon after, we were asking the question,

44
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:12,240
what if we had an expert in subject X or subject Y as a host, and how would that influence how they interact with their guests?

45
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,400
Dr Phil seemed to serve as the answer to this question.

46
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:20,000
The only person in the world I've ever wanted to cheer for me was him.

47
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Look at him.

48
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
The only person in the world...

49
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Stand up.

50
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
You're hiding from him. I want you to look at him, and let me tell you something, I want you to listen.

51
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,480
I don't want you to go off and think about what you're going to say in response.

52
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:41,200
I want you to listen and look her in the eye and hear what she's saying.

53
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:46,640
These segments proved to be extremely popular, with Oprah giving them an increasingly regular presence on her program.

54
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:54,440
As this popularity persisted, Winfrey, being the business person that she is, decided that Dr Phil McGraw's sections had the potential to be its own TV series.

55
00:05:54,440 --> 00:06:02,520
So in 2002, four years after our visiting expert made his debut appearance on Oprah, Dr Phil was launched to impressive ratings that had maintained themselves

56
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:10,280
during the show's long and illustrious lifespan, receiving multiple Daytime Emmy nominations, and praise from viewers who feel that Dr Phil's more measured approach to his guests

57
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,960
allows them to be viewed through a more human lens.

58
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,800
However, as we've seen with other talk show hosts, what is presented is never quite the full picture.

59
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:25,280
It should go without saying that TV is very selective, even more so than other mediums, and over time, Dr Phil's show garnered more and more critics,

60
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,160
who questioned the professionalism and ethics behind the treatment of the guests involved,

61
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:35,880
also culminating in a flurry of allegations made by former employees and guests towards the show's producers, and of course the man himself,

62
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:40,200
leading many to question whether the show was really a force for good.

63
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:47,000
Well, ladies, gentlemen, and all complementary variations, today we'll delve into Dr Phil, the rise and success of the show,

64
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:56,680
alongside its notable social media renaissance, we'll also investigate the controversy and the concomitant ethical questions of our beloved TV title at the centre of today's video.

65
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:02,360
My friends, let us not dwell any longer, it is time to discuss the dangers of Dr Phil.

66
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,560
And now, ad time.

67
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:16,920
When it comes to making videos, I have many weapons in my arsenal, but there's one secret weapon that's so powerful, former president George W. Bush wants to invade my house.

68
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:24,440
You see my friends, I am harbouring a weapon of mass production, so it's time for me to open up and let you see it.

69
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:32,680
This is vidIQ, yes, the vidIQ, the secret weapon that helps you print out bangers like the Weimar Republic prints money.

70
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:39,640
How? Let's just say it'll give you much needed help on video titles, titles that will actually make people gaze upon its poetry.

71
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:45,320
Not enough? How about some time tinkering with the algorithm so it picks up views from trending videos similar to yours?

72
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:51,160
Maybe stealing some of Jay Aubrey's viewers for your own? I mean, what's that twink gonna do about it?

73
00:07:51,160 --> 00:08:03,400
Now, you're probably worried about your enemies, your competitors, or even your friends. Maybe all three, but don't worry, vidIQ will spy on all those trending keywords they're using, with more commitment and dedication than the KGB.

74
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:14,440
Now, this powerful weapon can't work if you don't work. Fort is a YouTuber who carries an empty vessel of ideas, a useless being leeching off the nectar of society, that's what.

75
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:20,360
So that's it, you may say, vidIQ cannot be of any assistance because you simply do not have the imagination.

76
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:34,600
I mean, it's not like it can come up with 50 video ideas every day for you, right? Wrong. Because it will. 50 ideas each day. Save that pesky thought process for more fitting scenarios like Overwatch 2.

77
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:42,200
So now you're asking, how can this possibly be? You're thinking, surely there's no team of humans big enough to do all this work for you.

78
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:54,520
And you're right, no team of humans could ever be big enough for such a colossal task. But what if I told you it's not humans that run this? What if I told you it's all run by a powerful AI?

79
00:08:54,520 --> 00:09:02,840
This AI will scour every inch of YouTube for you, providing you with all the information you could ever need about what those YouTubers are up to.

80
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:10,760
But I can tell that you're worried. You're asking if this powerful AI follows Asimov's three laws of artificial intelligence. A good question.

81
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:20,440
All I can say is that during the robot apocalypse, I think vidIQ will be on the side of humanity. But how much can this monthly subscription possibly cost?

82
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:27,880
How much can a weapon of such power break the bank? Can you even put a price on an AI rivaling God themselves?

83
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:39,720
Well the bigwigs over at vidIQ HQ said $49 a month, but that wasn't good enough for me. So engaging my exquisite negotiation skills and some articulate ransom notes,

84
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:50,600
I have brought the price of their first month down by nearly 99%. So now you lovely people can venture onto YouTube with vidIQ for just $1 for their first month.

85
00:09:50,600 --> 00:10:03,880
Yes, $1. Nearly 99% off. That's like buying a nondescript certain YouTuber's Tesla for $500. It's like reducing a life sentence for ransom to 6 months,

86
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:12,360
which would be great in this instance. It's Rishi Sunak reduced to just his thumb and leading the nation like he does now. I don't know about you,

87
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:19,560
but a thumb seems like a very electable option to me. If this proposition interests you, click the link in the description below

88
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:28,200
to subscribe to vidIQ for $1 for the first month, see how you like it. It might just change your game. Back to the video.

89
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:48,600
Allow me to introduce you to a man that you may not have heard of. This champ is called Les Crane, and in the 1960s he had a somewhat

90
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:54,360
popular late night program fittingly called The Les Crane Show. In an attempt to compete with other programs at the time,

91
00:10:54,360 --> 00:11:00,120
they introduced a format which involved a shotgun microphone and members of the audience, whom he would proceed to grill on a multitude of

92
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:04,520
affairs, including socially sensitive topics of that time, such as homosexuality.

93
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:13,640
I have to differ with you, I have to argue with you on that one point there, because there are some homosexuals who are that way because of either

94
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:22,520
environment or because of a background that has caused them to go that route. Now, that doesn't mean that all homosexuals are sick people.

95
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:29,520
But not through, it's not something that happens through seduction or anything like that, the background is just that they grew up in a society,

96
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:36,680
and they found the existing heterosexual norms, not to their liking, whether it was the way they perceived their own parental relationships.

97
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:42,880
On one episode, he had hosted a debate with Lee Harvey Oswald's mother on the topic of her son's guilt, which was concluded with an

98
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:47,920
editorial recap from Mel Brooks of all people, but unfortunately, I couldn't retrieve any footage of such.

99
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:54,720
By all means, Les Crane was perceived as a vigorous, yet reasoned interviewer, and although the tabloid label was retroactively applied to his show,

100
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:59,000
not too long after followed what many believe was a more fitting prototype for the genre.

101
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:25,200
This is Joe Pine, he was another 50s and 60s talk show host who garnered popularity on radio and TV for his often outspoken and opinionated demeanor.

102
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:33,280
However, in 1965, his own self-titled talk show went into wide syndication, these typically involved fiery discussions with highly controversial guests,

103
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:38,320
coloured by Pine's own racially progressive, yet otherwise socially conservative political positions.

104
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:45,680
These conversations would regularly escalate into shouting matches, and even physical aggression, with reports being that chairs would regularly be thrown,

105
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:52,440
and Pine would have to eject his guests live on TV. Although receiving criticism for his platforming of vicious and even dangerous individuals,

106
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,600
he continued to retain a steady viewership until the show's cessation a couple years later.

107
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:04,560
In the years following, a number of hosts utilised similar blueprints for their talk shows, but after the heights of the Vietnam War and hippie culture that were a catalyst for a lot of these broadcasts,

108
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:10,960
the genre maintained a middling profile that wasn't the source of great discourse, mostly carried by Phil Donahue and Dick Cavett,

109
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:16,280
both of whom were known for their slightly more dignified techniques, though not without their exceptional moments.

110
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:22,560
However, this began to change once more in the 1980s, with the emergence of shows that catered towards more controversial subjects

111
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:26,200
that regularly resulted in conflicts between the guests and the hosts.

112
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,280
Go ahead and talk.

113
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:27,960
So shut up.

114
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,560
No, no, you shut up.

115
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,320
So shut up.

116
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,600
Sit down.

117
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,440
Sit down.

118
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,040
You had your chance of fame.

119
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,720
You had your chance of fame.

120
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,520
Sit down.

121
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,720
You had your chance of fame.

122
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,720
So look out.

123
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,720
Come on.

124
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,720
Come on.

125
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,720
Come on.

126
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,720
Come on.

127
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,720
Come on.

128
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,720
Come on.

129
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,720
Come on.

130
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,720
Come on.

131
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,720
Come on.

132
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:53,120
Probably the most famous example of this is Jerry Springer, the syndicated show named after its host.

133
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:58,480
Springer, a former lawyer and civic official, had initially conceived the show as a forum for political debate,

134
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:03,040
but after a few unsuccessful seasons, Springer and his new producer overhauled this concept,

135
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:07,360
and decided to focus on more personal issues with members of the public as their guests,

136
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:12,080
complemented by scripted sequences that would regularly escalate into physical confrontation,

137
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:15,040
sort of like Oprah meets WWE.

138
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:20,800
It clearly took a few notes from Joe Pine's show, while replacing the political content with more sociological matters.

139
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:25,120
Although the scripted sequences would eventually be scrapped, the topics were similarly contentious,

140
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,320
and were still the source of numerous controversies over the years that followed.

141
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,800
However, the success spoke for itself, and it wasn't long before the genre was more popular than ever,

142
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:38,000
featuring multiple syndicated shows with different hosts and international producers taking an interest as well.

143
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,840
Probably the most famous overseas example in the UK is The Jeremy Carr Show,

144
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:46,880
which ran for a total of 17 seasons, and was no less frenzied than its American contemporaries.

145
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:53,200
There! Listen! Look, I'm a boyfriend! Oh, don't worry about you!

146
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:57,600
You didn't mean it! I was with you all the time! Everyone's seen you all the time!

147
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,600
Keep going! I'm with you!

148
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:04,880
Oh, shut up, me!

149
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,000
So there we go!

150
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,520
Nonetheless, in spite of these ratings, the controversies are no less troubling for certain viewers, and even businesses.

151
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:16,000
As entertaining as conflict can be, many hosts played a role that could be perceived as provocative,

152
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,680
and as a person who is also trying to present themselves as an arbiter, that seemed a somewhat compromising problem.

153
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,840
The audience also often didn't help, seeming more like citizens in a Roman Colosseum,

154
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:29,200
ready to watch whatever gladiatorial combat was about to transpire.

155
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:33,840
Producers also participated by purposefully choosing topics that would garner the most views,

156
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:37,760
but at the same time, could also cause the most damage to the people actually involved.

157
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:42,640
Anyone who's familiar with conflict resolution knows the last thing you need is a large mob egging you on,

158
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:47,360
and therefore this sort of TV, although entertaining for some, was deeply discomforting for others.

159
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,280
A lot of these shows have been taken off air since, some the result of host fatigue,

160
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:55,280
some the result of TV scandals, and some the result of actual deaths.

161
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:59,040
Many of these shows also employed methods that were questionable in their authority.

162
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:03,120
A polygraph or lie detector, for example, is always a popular piece of equipment.

163
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:08,560
Its accuracy, however, is never guaranteed, yet its word was treated like gospel on all of these programs.

164
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:13,680
In the case of The Jeremy Carr Show, it was taken off the air after a guest who was known to have suffered from depression,

165
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:19,200
took his own life following his appearance and failure of a polygraph, of which Carr persistently insulted his guest,

166
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:25,200
and branded him a serial liar, of which the coroner concluded could well have contributed to his untimely death.

167
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:28,960
With The Revelation, there were probably other people who suffered the same fate as well.

168
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:33,760
I'd like to say that it was a sudden moral consciousness that kicked in the demise of many of these shows,

169
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:38,080
but I think it became apparent to producers and studios that these shows were liabilities,

170
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:42,080
and that if they continued to utilise techniques that provoked their guests in such a way,

171
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:45,280
they could easily be facing some very serious lawsuits.

172
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:52,320
So over the 21st century, these shows have slowly faded into re-run rotation, but what could have taken its place?

173
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,920
Well, this is where Dr. Phil makes his grand entrance.

174
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:06,240
When he arrived on the scene in 2002, this sort of content was just passing its peak,

175
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,160
but still pulling significant ratings.

176
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,560
The market was pretty saturated, and there were more than enough talk show hosts for viewers to choose from.

177
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:18,160
The only real thing he had going for him on paper was his qualifications, and the backing of the behemoth that was Oprah.

178
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:22,320
However, he'd need more than that for the sort of longevity that she had enjoyed.

179
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,400
What would he do to ensure that?

180
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,440
Well, let me introduce you to Dr. Phil.

181
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:43,200
The year now is 2022, if my upload schedule is intact, and Dr. Phil has been up and running for 20 seasons.

182
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:48,640
It has outlasted nearly every tabloid talk show, a majority of normal talk shows, including Oprah,

183
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,560
and still pulls significant viewership.

184
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,040
He must have done something right.

185
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,360
You call people trailer trash or rednecks.

186
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:56,960
I have.

187
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,440
Okay, 90% of people are stupid.

188
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,440
There should be a law passed against stupid people.

189
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:09,760
Well, you better hope that isn't true.

190
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:16,200
From the off, Dr. Phil seemed to set himself apart from the competition, particularly in his approach to how he treated guests.

191
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,720
I think many hosts, even the ones that were probably more sensitive than most,

192
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:25,000
didn't have the human background to navigate the complex issues that many of these shows often sought to tackle.

193
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,480
Now, McGraw wasn't a full time psychologist.

194
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,920
As we know, he was a bit of a jack of all trades,

195
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:35,560
but his educational background in clinical psychology and at least some degree of practical experience made him a much

196
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:39,840
better fit for the moderating position that such an individual should typically occupy.

197
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:48,060
You also said women are really emotional, and men are logical, and I got the sense,

198
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,980
and I'm just asked you tell me what you think.

199
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:54,140
I'm not trying to I just want to know where you come down on it.

200
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:58,780
You said that is, though logic is at this level,

201
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:03,060
and emotion is at a lesser level of functioning.

202
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:05,380
Is that how you think he feels?

203
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:10,740
Psychology isn't just about knowing all these behavioral terms or knowing how to approach them.

204
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:13,060
Honestly, that would make pretty dry TV.

205
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:19,340
A lot of the art is in being able to deconstruct people's behavior and language to reach the core of how they're feeling.

206
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:24,420
The truth is, a lot of people don't say how they're feeling, particularly in these situations when their behaviors or

207
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:25,660
beliefs may be challenged.

208
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:32,060
It's a very interpretive job and requires picking out certain details that you may typically overlook in everyday conversation.

209
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:34,180
Now, I'm sure Dr Phil has his own style.

210
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:37,620
However, when the show started, he definitely demonstrated this ability,

211
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:42,220
and this often allowed him to connect with his guests more successfully than others from around his time.

212
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:44,300
And you feel guilty about this, don't you?

213
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:47,420
You feel guilty about where she is and what she's doing?

214
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:47,860
Yes.

215
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:48,700
Do you?

216
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:52,540
Because you guys say we're kind of blaming ourselves for this.

217
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:55,220
Have you intended to sabotage your daughter?

218
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:55,580
No.

219
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,300
Have you intended to make her stubborn?

220
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:57,660
No.

221
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:58,620
Non-compliant?

222
00:19:58,620 --> 00:19:58,860
No.

223
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:00,900
Disobedient, rebellious.

224
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:03,020
So we need to put blame out of this.

225
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:05,500
Parents don't need to be feeling blame about this.

226
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:11,780
What you need to be thinking about here is that you have a responsibility for what's happened.

227
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:17,340
Dr Phil took a familiar formula, the fact that one or more people had a problem, the problem affected their daily life,

228
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:18,500
and they wish to address it.

229
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:22,900
Now, when you present this scenario to a majority of tabloid talk show hosts or their producers,

230
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:25,780
the question will be, how can we generate the most drama?

231
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:30,660
The approach that Dr Phil appears to take is more related to how can this problem be addressed?

232
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:33,900
And for many, there's a great satisfaction within problem resolution.

233
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:37,940
Other talk show hosts presented talking about your problems as being intimidating,

234
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:40,700
and certainly didn't really inspire people to seek out help.

235
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:45,540
And to be fair to Dr Phil, studies have shown that viewers of his shows are more likely to do just that,

236
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:47,820
and that's really nothing to turn your nose up at.

237
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:52,220
When dealing with certain disputes, he didn't seem to be insensitive to the human facts of play.

238
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:54,780
The human factors are what made Dr Phil appealing.

239
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:58,940
One of the skills to what his show does is one that I describe as extraction.

240
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:02,380
A lot of the time, Dr Phil would be presented with a specific situation,

241
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:06,460
one that on the surface could be rather niche and certainly not applicable to you or I.

242
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,060
Everyone has their own unique situations and challenges,

243
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:12,820
but a lot of the time they can also be rooted in general struggles that can affect anyone,

244
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:18,500
and by being able to focus on that, he could connect with audience members who may be emotionally moved by hearing such struggles.

245
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:20,380
This is something he's referenced in interviews,

246
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:24,540
and although some would justifiably find it a bit objectifying towards his guests,

247
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:26,940
it's also definitely the source of some success.

248
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:35,220
What I'm recommending is empirically supported in the psychological and psychiatric literature,

249
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:42,020
and I don't diagnose people, and I say very clearly, I can't diagnose you here.

250
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:45,660
I would have to complete a lot more interview than I have time to do.

251
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:48,740
I would have to do a battery of psychometric tests.

252
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:52,940
I'd probably have to do a brain workup and some lab work, and I can't do that here.

253
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:57,900
Now, in the short list of my considerations, if I was doing it, might be the following,

254
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:00,820
but these are things you're going to check out when you leave here.

255
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:07,260
And so they look at that and say, you know what, I think this guy's checking all the boxes.

256
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:14,340
Yeah. Well, so it just seems from that explanation that what you're doing is more for everybody else than for the person sitting in that chair, maybe.

257
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:16,140
They're teaching tools.

258
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,460
Everybody there is a teaching tool.

259
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,700
If I'm talking to you, it's a trade-off.

260
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:24,820
You get up close and personal focus and lots of resources,

261
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:30,740
because I have a blue ribbon advisory board with the top minds from the top learning centers in the country.

262
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:34,740
I do think it can help to put individuals more in touch with their own mental health,

263
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:39,180
with mind to the fact that such information should be handled carefully, which will put a pin in for now.

264
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:48,620
Did it never occur to you that, you know what, I'm putting myself first and my need to vent and my need to explode.

265
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:51,580
I'm putting that ahead of my children's best interest.

266
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:52,740
He yells at me too.

267
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:53,940
You don't get it.

268
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:57,380
I hope all of you at home get it, but you don't get it.

269
00:22:57,420 --> 00:23:01,180
The angle that Dr. Phil adopts is also really important for audience retention.

270
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:05,820
There are lots of causes for people's mistakes and misdeeds, some of which we'll never understand.

271
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:09,300
However, Dr. Phil's focus on personal responsibility is universal.

272
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:12,780
I wholeheartedly believe good people can do bad things and learn from them.

273
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:16,660
At the same time, the only way to properly grow is to accept responsibility,

274
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:22,700
because if you assign all rationale for your behavior to external circumstances, you're admitting you don't have control over your actions.

275
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:26,580
Personal responsibility is the driving force for change, and by focusing on that,

276
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:31,500
Dr. Phil ensures that his show has the ability to find the solution within the problems presented.

277
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:37,380
In discussing people's specific problems, McGraw always managed to approach it from a perspective that gave it mass appeal,

278
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:42,300
retaining its educational grounding, while still speaking directly to the guests.

279
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:44,140
It was accessible, yet challenging.

280
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:48,380
I don't doubt it has probably helped a fair few people in not just understanding themselves,

281
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:53,980
but possibly being more empathetic to those around them, and impossibly recognizing those same signs.

282
00:23:54,020 --> 00:24:00,900
Dr. Phil's demeanor also aids viewers in how they may feel morally about watching content that could typically leave vulnerable individuals

283
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,900
somewhat exposed in the eye of the media.

284
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:10,260
As much as gladiatorial combat enthralls those who desire it, there's always the question of the cost to those brave warriors who put themselves out there.

285
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:15,340
The Dr. Phil show presented discussion on these matters as if they were the first step to getting genuine help,

286
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:21,100
and therefore, viewers could feel more at ease believing that they weren't necessarily contributing to a harmful practice.

287
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:25,020
A lot of guests seemed to be in a better place after a discussion with Dr. Phil,

288
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:31,340
and whereas other tabloid talk show hosts almost focused on escalation, the art of Dr. Phil seemed to be de-escalation.

289
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:37,100
Each reaches some sort of conclusion, but the latter seems more mutually favorable in the long term.

290
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:41,420
I think in this case, Dr. Phil carved out an industry niche like very few others,

291
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:46,380
the show that took a genre nearly done to death and subverted it, and started its own trend,

292
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:52,460
this being what some branded as self-help TV, a more conscious way to approach issues that have previously been treated with apathy,

293
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:54,780
and even provocation on mainstream television.

294
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:59,260
It's clear that Dr. Phil saw himself less as a therapist and more as a moderator,

295
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:04,700
and wished to present himself as the reasonable voice within often two very strongly contrasting ones,

296
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:11,220
and for many viewers, they perceived him as just that, and tuned in to hear that voice discuss affairs that may hit close to home.

297
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:15,820
And as one of the pioneers of this new movement, it was only upwards from there.

298
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:17,980
But was there something more at stake?

299
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:52,060
One of the common appraisals of Dr. Phil is that he was clearly an intelligent guy,

300
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,460
and there was little doubt about that.

301
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:57,140
The dude knew how to present a TV show, and as the ratings followed suit,

302
00:25:57,140 --> 00:26:01,020
he enjoyed success that even rivaled his superiors, and over the coming decades,

303
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:03,380
he would only grow his influence as a cultural icon.

304
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:08,780
At first, many viewers did consider him of the more academic cloth, particularly with his background and experience.

305
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:12,540
However, professional psychologists seldom have illustrious TV careers,

306
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:16,060
because the topic is often at odds with a lot of the principles of entertainment.

307
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:21,940
I think McGraw identified this pretty quickly, and in interviews, he didn't tie himself too closely to the occupation,

308
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:26,380
more emphasizing his nature to inform people to go and receive proper help.

309
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:30,500
A lot of individuals might speculate on how Dr. Phil evolved over the years.

310
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:33,740
A lot of TV shows tend to change, and when discussing talk shows,

311
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:36,140
they often evolved to their structure to stay relevant,

312
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:39,980
and even somewhat acceptable within the ever-adjusting moral compass of the viewers.

313
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:41,740
Dr. Phil was different in this sense.

314
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:44,180
He maintained a lot of consistency with his style.

315
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:47,940
However, what I think changed was how it was presented and perceived by others around it.

316
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:51,180
Indeed, as that style garnered popularity in the mainstream industry,

317
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:55,260
he found a new status as a bit of an oracle on affairs affecting the world in general,

318
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:59,540
and one that placed him in a rather unique position, but posed a few challenges of their own.

319
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:01,740
However, the doctor here responded accordingly.

320
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:11,180
I do believe that there comes a moment in time where all things wrong can be made right.

321
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:16,380
But if we're gonna do this, we're gonna do this my way.

322
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:22,140
In 2006, McGraw chose not to renew his license to practice psychology professionally in Texas.

323
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:24,940
Some may ask whether this affected his ability to run his show.

324
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:27,260
However, in California, where said show was based,

325
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:30,380
their respective Board of Psychology reported to have agreed that Dr.

326
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:35,220
Phil does not actually practice psychology on his show and therefore does not require a license.

327
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,820
Some have questioned why he did this,

328
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:40,140
and my personal opinion holds that if he didn't actually need it for his show,

329
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:42,740
then it likely became a liability in his eyes.

330
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:46,380
Being a practicing psychologist obviously comes with certain responsibilities,

331
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:48,620
and if he or his show was found to have breached them,

332
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:51,860
even if he wasn't presenting himself in a psychological capacity,

333
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:54,620
then he could have landed himself in some serious shit,

334
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:59,500
which would have generated a lot more controversy than him just opting not to renew his license.

335
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:13,140
A lot of people found this out during Britney Spears' life crisis in 2008.

336
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:14,940
During a stint where she had been hospitalized,

337
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:17,980
her parents, clearly eager to support her, invited Dr.

338
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:21,180
Phil to her bedside, an invitation which he readily accepted.

339
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:22,300
However, after his visit,

340
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:24,540
Dr. Phil decided to issue a public statement,

341
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:28,180
expressing an urgency for the troubled pop star to receive medical support.

342
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:30,540
This was met with disappointment from Spears' parents,

343
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:34,420
who expressed that McGraw had violated their trust by issuing a public statement,

344
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:38,740
and it was even alleged that a complaint had been filed to the Board of Psychology that McGraw had practiced

345
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:40,340
psychology without a license.

346
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:43,940
Now, there are a few more layers to this than a lot of press reported at the time.

347
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:49,900
Dr. Phil did actually know Britney's parents in a personal capacity and claimed to have attended the hospital as a friend,

348
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,100
and not a therapist.

349
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:55,620
Nonetheless, it still engendered a lot of discourse about his responsibility as a public figure,

350
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:58,260
and his outspoken reputation on mental health,

351
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:02,300
with many asking the question of whether he had actually breached his responsibility as a confidant.

352
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:04,980
Dr. Phil did actually issue a response to this on his website,

353
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:09,980
where he clarified he did not practice psychology and had no intent to practice it in the foreseeable future.

354
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:14,820
It definitely showcased the dichotomy with how many audience members viewed him and how he viewed himself,

355
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:16,100
and in spite of these statements,

356
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:19,180
many still held him as an expert in his respective field,

357
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:21,420
and to be fair, it's not like he disagreed.

358
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:26,980
In his statement, he still drew attention to the fact that he had decades of experience and a PhD to show for it.

359
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:28,900
He was still a doctor after all.

360
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:32,380
Although Dr. Phil didn't seem to change in his approach towards guests,

361
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:36,500
not too long after dropping his license, McGraw seemed to expand his franchise.

362
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:40,980
Many continued to utilize the notion of expert advice, including the show The Doctors,

363
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:44,380
which, although not featuring McGraw, was created and produced by him.

364
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:48,100
The Doctors is another talk show that leans more into the general medical issues,

365
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:52,540
and was relatively successful, being canceled in 2022 after 14 seasons.

366
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:55,220
Another recent show, House Calls with Dr. Phil,

367
00:29:55,220 --> 00:30:00,140
once more uses a trope more associated with traditional doctors who may be called to a patient's abode,

368
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:04,620
though looking at the state of healthcare nowadays, I'm surprised we didn't get phone calls with Dr. Phil.

369
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:06,820
He also launched the company Doctor on Demand,

370
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:10,700
which allowed individuals to schedule appointments with medical and psychological professionals.

371
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:14,860
I'll say that it's a good thing he was providing a platform for more licensed experts,

372
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:19,980
but I also think it's indicative of the fact that he still enjoyed his status and wanted to make the most of it.

373
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:23,340
The truth was, whether he felt like a practicing psychologist or not,

374
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:25,300
it was clear how other people viewed him.

375
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:31,540
The other reason why there aren't a lot of TV figures in the realm of Dr. Phil's is because of the sensitivity of humans themselves,

376
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:33,300
and the trouble that can cause.

377
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:35,460
Dr. Phil was no stranger to that either.

378
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:39,420
In fact, even his most successful, he could be facing multiple lawsuits,

379
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:43,420
mostly from disgruntled guests who were unhappy with their portrayal of the show.

380
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:46,380
A large majority of these lawsuits were fairly quickly dismissed,

381
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:49,300
with judges finding the coverage provided by Dr. Phil was fair,

382
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:52,340
and McGraw's language being protected under the First Amendment.

383
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:55,340
Dr. Phil occupied this near bulletproof position,

384
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:58,260
where his words were viewed as holding a significant amount of weight,

385
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:04,100
yet could never officially bear that much responsibility as he operated and presented the show as a talk show host.

386
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:05,700
He may not have changed his method,

387
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:11,220
but he definitely shifted his image towards a more business oriented model that provided him with more protection.

388
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:15,260
He would regularly make TV appearances and stage interventions with other celebrities,

389
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:17,740
ordinary people, or washed up TV stars.

390
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:23,740
Obtaining this Messiah-like status amongst many is the guy who would fly in and rescue you from your lowest points,

391
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:25,500
or give you a good pep talk at least.

392
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:28,660
As the halfway point between medical professional and entertainer,

393
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:34,100
Dr. Phil had occupied a position in the media that enabled him to develop his brand with extensive influence,

394
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:37,540
while maintaining an audience who respected his approach to sensitive matters.

395
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:42,420
It was a devastating combination, and it seemed like there was very little that could undo it.

396
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:49,220
However, would the necessity to occupy two quite conflicting positions pose a challenge as the media landscape evolved?

397
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,620
Well, let's find out.

398
00:31:51,620 --> 00:32:05,780
Hey, Dr. Phil here.

399
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:09,860
I'm backstage getting ready to do the show, which is where you're used to seeing me.

400
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:14,860
But in the virtual world of computer games, I can be somebody completely different.

401
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:24,860
I can be super mortal Phil, defender of my countrymen, and a super stud who gets to have cool hair while playing.

402
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:32,860
And in this virtual world, I'm agile, powerful, and I never have to do what my wife says.

403
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:37,860
As known to the start, this sort of content has mostly found its footing within the airwaves of mainstream television,

404
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:41,860
and throughout most of its early lifespan, there was nothing that could really change that.

405
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:47,860
However, over time, with the increasing influence of social media, opportunities presented themselves for TV networks to advertise,

406
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:49,860
and possibly garner new viewers.

407
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:56,860
It also served as an archive for viewers who may have missed the show, or wanted to rewatch popular clips without too much inconvenience.

408
00:32:56,860 --> 00:33:03,860
With this in mind, it's not hard to see why the Dr. Phil show was one of the earlier TV shows to serve a channel on the budding website known as YouTube.

409
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:07,860
A platform like YouTube provided the perfect opportunity for success.

410
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:12,860
At its inception, it only really allowed for shorter clips, which I know is hard to actually remember,

411
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:19,860
but for a TV show like Dr. Phil, this meant that snippets of the show could be put online to hopefully reel new audience members in.

412
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:23,860
However, at that time, YouTube was much more oriented towards homegrown content,

413
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:28,860
and although the Dr. Phil producers tried their best by publishing multiple interviews with famous names,

414
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:34,860
using clips often addressing trending topics, and even having McGraw respond to comments in his own YouTube series,

415
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:37,860
nothing ever quite went viral like they may have hoped.

416
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:42,860
This did not deter them though, and over the years, they continued to upload content that cultivated an audience,

417
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:47,860
and as YouTube became more palatable to mainstream sources who were able to upload high definition content,

418
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:54,860
and with users becoming more intrigued by subjects of Dr. Phil's episodes, the view count seemed to begin to pick up significantly.

419
00:33:54,860 --> 00:34:00,860
This was definitely aided by the rise of the early commentary genre that specialised in talking about other people,

420
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:03,860
particularly those who may have been slightly more eccentric than the average Joe.

421
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:05,860
It certainly paid off.

422
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:10,860
It's just so fascinating when something catches like that girl. What is her name? The catch me outside girl.

423
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:15,860
Uh, Danielle Bregoli or something? Something like that, yeah.

424
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:18,860
Cause I didn't know her as the catch me outside girl.

425
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:24,860
Another emerging trend was the nature for the internet to bestow meme status onto people.

426
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:30,860
Now, this had its roots in something quite usual, our culture has always enjoyed making overnight sensations of relatively unknown figures.

427
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:34,860
How the internet certainly made this easier, targeting people who stood out from the crowd,

428
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:37,860
whether that be due to their behaviour or just their appearance.

429
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:44,860
Now, in many ways, this could be quite fortuitous for someone like Dr. Phil, whose content was built on dealing with often challenging personas,

430
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:51,860
but often to acquire such a status, a person needs to be a perfect storm of characteristics that hasn't been seen elsewhere,

431
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:54,860
and those sorts of people are a rare breed.

432
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:59,860
With that in mind, I'd like to introduce you to someone by the name of Danielle Bregoli.

433
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:04,860
I'm pretty violent. I'm with her in the face cause she wouldn't get out of my face.

434
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:08,860
Either I'm breaking down her door or she's breaking down my door.

435
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:11,860
I don't stop till I start seeing dents in a door.

436
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:17,860
Danielle Bregoli was like many Dr. Phil guests, a troubled youth who possess serious behavioral issues,

437
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:21,860
and externalize them in a way that many youngsters have a tendency to do.

438
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:27,860
Dr. Phil often showcased troubled teens on his show, and on paper, the premise of her appearance was not exceptional.

439
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:32,860
However, paper can only account for so many variables, and when she took the stage in early 2016,

440
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:36,860
it was clear that this was not going to be any ordinary episode.

441
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:40,860
I ain't gonna lie, there's no reason to lie, everybody know already, like...

442
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:48,860
What do you say to yourself that gives you the right to take somebody else's car?

443
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:53,860
You're talking about sliding? F*** you mean? That's what makes me want to take the next bitch car.

444
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:57,860
What now? I'm sorry I didn't get that. Are you speaking English?

445
00:35:57,860 --> 00:36:02,860
A lot of the youths that Dr. Phil addressed on the show definitely conformed to a certain mold.

446
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:06,860
It was clear they were projecting aspects of culture they idolized onto themselves,

447
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:11,860
and therefore that behavior, although sometimes extremely challenging, was not unfamiliar.

448
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:18,860
Danielle Bregoli seemed to bring her own personal flavor to the role, and her extremely abrasive attitude also played into that.

449
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:22,860
Dr. Phil in this case played the usual role of mediator attempting to reason with her,

450
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:25,860
but sometimes people just aren't there to be reasoned with,

451
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:28,860
and her relationship with the audience only inflamed that.

452
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:31,860
Soon Danielle was turning on everyone within the vicinity,

453
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:34,860
making threats that didn't seem quite as threatening as they could be.

454
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:38,860
Did you say the hoes are laughing?

455
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:39,860
Yep.

456
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:41,860
So the audience are a bunch of hoes.

457
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:42,860
Yep.

458
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:49,860
Catch me outside, how bout dat?

459
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:51,860
Catch me outside, how bout dat?

460
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:55,860
Catch you outside, what does that mean?

461
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:57,860
What'd I just say?

462
00:36:57,860 --> 00:36:59,860
At first it didn't pick up too many views,

463
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:05,860
but over time it garnered traction, and eventually the famous quote at the end of the video became noteworthy to many online observers.

464
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:08,860
It wasn't long until their antics were provided international coverage,

465
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:13,860
and memes started cropping up all over social media that made a mockery out of her language and demeanor,

466
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:15,860
amassing online notoriety.

467
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:19,860
Although the show was instrumental in the facilitation of this popularity,

468
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:22,860
Dr. Phil wasn't really at the center of this discourse,

469
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:25,860
only one person really mattered, and that was Bregoli.

470
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:27,860
However, she definitely started something online,

471
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:32,860
and not too long after, a new genre of respiring commentators presented itself.

472
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:34,860
Catch me outside, how bout dat?

473
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:38,860
Bro, I give up on these kids nowadays, dude. I'm so done with these fucking kids.

474
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:40,860
This is Trigga Trove.

475
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:44,860
He was one of the first creators to pick up on the fascination with many Dr. Phil guests,

476
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:47,860
particularly those that appealed to certain outlandish stereotypes.

477
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:50,860
As Daniel Bregoli began to garner online attention,

478
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:52,860
the then budding creator released a video titled,

479
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:55,860
The Catch Me Outside, How Bout Dat Girl Roast,

480
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:56,860
and the rest was history.

481
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:58,860
Yeah, I know where the car at.

482
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:01,860
You know where the car at?

483
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:03,860
Did you go to fifth grade?

484
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:05,860
Did you go to fifth grade?

485
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:06,860
Did you go to fifth grade?

486
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:08,860
Fifth grade? Fifth grade?

487
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:11,860
God damn, Dr. Phil, you straight roasted her ass.

488
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:12,860
Did you go to fifth grade?

489
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:15,860
Dr. Phil, more like doctor, you gotta fucking chill.

490
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:18,860
The then less than 2,000 subscriber creator had struck gold,

491
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:21,860
and he only continued in that direction for the following year.

492
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:24,860
That is childish and immature behaviour.

493
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:26,860
Now I get to leave.

494
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:27,860
Yes, you do.

495
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:28,860
No.

496
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:30,860
Don't let the door hit you in the ass.

497
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:33,860
Oh my God, what a savage.

498
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:36,860
I didn't realise Dr. Phil was such a gangster.

499
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:40,860
Dozens of Dr. Phil videos became the focus of online content,

500
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:41,860
reaching more audiences than ever,

501
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:43,860
and the producers, as they always have been,

502
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:45,860
were sure to cash in on this new opportunity,

503
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:48,860
publishing more content on the platform than they ever had before.

504
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:50,860
Today on an all new Dr. Phil.

505
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:52,860
You're ugly, you're disgusting,

506
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:54,860
I'm gonna kill you, give me $200.

507
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:58,860
Damn, Dr. Phil's a stone cold savage.

508
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:00,860
I didn't know Dr. Phil would come after you like that.

509
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:02,860
I mean, he did try and break into my house one time.

510
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:04,860
I want the money.

511
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:08,860
I'll raise enough hell till you give in and give it to me.

512
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:13,860
What do you think of me now?

513
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:18,860
Yes, Dr. Phil, get it!

514
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:21,860
It seems this genre of content had given Dr. Phil a fresh wind,

515
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:24,860
a relevance amongst a new generation of viewers who wanted to engage in that content.

516
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:29,860
One of the greatest drawbacks to mainstream television is that many believe it doesn't appeal to younger people,

517
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:32,860
and at the end of the day, they're the future older people.

518
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:36,860
Yet less than half a year after Danielle Bregoli's first appearance,

519
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:41,860
Dr. Phil enjoyed over 150 consecutive weeks at the top of the syndicated TV ratings,

520
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:45,860
beating out Maury, Wendy Williams, and yes, Ellen.

521
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:49,860
With this in mind, it's clear that Dr. Phil had captured the attention of a new cohort of viewers,

522
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:54,860
and it wasn't long until he signed another contract extending the series until 2023.

523
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:57,860
Everything was going right.

524
00:39:57,860 --> 00:40:06,860
Are you one of those parents who uses the TV as a babysitter? Next, a mom who can't...

525
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:14,860
With the help of social media, Dr. Phil seemed to have pulled off one of the more impressive feats in television.

526
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:18,860
He managed to make his content relevant to a new set of people, and it seemed they weren't going anywhere.

527
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:22,860
He subsequently leaned into this reputation, appearing on a variety of internet shows,

528
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:26,860
and even co-hosting PewDiePie's popular meme review series.

529
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:28,860
Take it away, doctor.

530
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:32,860
Hey everyone, it's Dr. Phil here, and I'm hosting Meme Review.

531
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:36,860
It seems his stoic, tough love style had become beloved by a fresh demographic,

532
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:39,860
all of whom had a platform to access this content freely.

533
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:45,860
However, social media can go two ways, and as much as they may love you one day, they may hate you the next.

534
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:48,860
Internet culture moves quickly, even more quickly these days in fact,

535
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:53,860
and about as soon as Dr. Phil was popularized by the content he and others post online,

536
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:57,860
more critical eyes were drawn towards him, finding a lot beneath the surface.

537
00:40:57,860 --> 00:41:03,860
It would be no surprise, given everything said thus far, that Dr. Phil wasn't without his enemies or his critics.

538
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:08,860
In fact, he has been subject to severe criticism from medical professionals since the inception of his show.

539
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:13,860
That can't be a surprise, really, given that his technique isn't actually one that's favored by most working in that profession.

540
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:20,860
Every parent should know the warning signs. For the most violent of criminals, there are 14 traits of serial killers.

541
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:27,860
Now meet parents terrified of their own young son who has 9 of the 14 traits.

542
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:31,860
Criticism of Dr. Phil has been present since the show's launch in 2002.

543
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:36,860
He was condemned by the National Alliance on Mental Illness after McGraw delivered a scathing public psychological analysis

544
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:41,860
of a 9-year-old in 2004, with academic commentary on his techniques not exactly changing since.

545
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:46,860
However, these narratives never had much impact because the majority of academics were on the fringe of popular culture at least,

546
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:50,860
with many operating strictly within their fields. Ten different psychological boards could condemn you,

547
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:53,860
and it wouldn't mean anything if they didn't receive any coverage.

548
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:58,860
So while Dr. Phil primarily occupied the realms of television, he was mostly immune to such commentary and controversy.

549
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:04,860
In spite of the numerous lawsuits and claims all the way up to 2017, you search Dr. Phil on the TV,

550
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:09,860
and the only result you'll find is the big man himself. However, this isn't quite the case with online search engines,

551
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:14,860
in particular YouTube, where Dr. Phil isn't the only person talking about Dr. Phil.

552
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:20,860
Yes, you see, whereas previously the closest that most academics could get to having a public platform would be an opinion piece

553
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:26,860
of the New York Times or an interview on MSNBC, there was now a whole website dedicated to allowing them to upload

554
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:31,860
their thoughts on their specialist subjects. Now, like with any learned commentator, the trick is to make sure the topics

555
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:36,860
you're talking about are somewhat relevant to the audience, and given that Dr. Phil was indeed very relevant,

556
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:40,860
many began to open up discourse on his methods, and their success, or lack thereof.

557
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:45,860
These took form of articles, YouTube videos, anything that gave an individual a way to express their feelings.

558
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:51,860
So if Phil McGraw says it's not therapy, and he's not practicing any way, what is it?

559
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:56,860
Kind of back to my original point, it's really just entertainment.

560
00:42:56,860 --> 00:43:03,860
All the seriousness with an insane amount of sound effects and transitions and just editorial nonsense.

561
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:09,860
My whole life changed the day I met Jazz because she's the most spectacular woman I've ever met.

562
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:14,860
It's no wonder people forget these are real human beings, the editing turns it all into a cartoon.

563
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:20,860
Most of this began to circulate around the start of 2019. Funnily enough, this wasn't during any specific drama,

564
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:25,860
more likely a product of Dr. Phil inertia, and the fact that people were growing more critical of prominent media

565
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:30,860
figures in general. McGraw had always accepted that he was a bit of an outcast from the industry, but I do think these

566
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:35,860
criticisms were somewhat contradictory to a lot of public opinion that had definitely heralded him as this universal

567
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:39,860
problem solver, particularly that which questioned the general morals of the show.

568
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:43,860
What did Dr. Phil have to offer other than an interesting premise for its time?

569
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:46,860
Okay, it's good to meet you. Hi, it's nice to meet you too.

570
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:51,860
Now, tell me what you mean when you say you're the reincarnation.

571
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:59,860
Because Pocahontas was my 13th grade grandmother, but I'm sharing her soul in my body.

572
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:04,860
So you can feel her presence in you? Yeah.

573
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:08,860
It's difficult being any sort of public figure and dealing with issues that are often deeply personal.

574
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:13,860
You're handling sensitive information, and one of the drawbacks of Dr. Phil's show is that no matter how good he could

575
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:17,860
have hypothetically been, the program was still designed to bring about drama, even if he wasn't.

576
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:22,860
And people began to pick up on that. Television and therapy have always seemed somewhat opposed to each other.

577
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:26,860
Although it's important that there are people prepared to be open about their struggles to help others,

578
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:31,860
it's still a subject that needs to be handled with sensitivity and care, and given the fact that some of these people

579
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:36,860
were not even on the show by their own volition, particularly children who were likely brought on by their parents,

580
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:42,860
it's hard to see the benefit that was derived. Simply put, you wouldn't see this sort of drama in a private therapy room

581
00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:47,860
because TV cameras and the presence of a large public audience always encourages people to act more defensive,

582
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:49,860
and even aggressive.

583
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:54,860
Now I have a career and I'm famous. That's what happens when you get famous, you cut people off.

584
00:44:54,860 --> 00:45:16,860
Everyone's upset with it, maybe because you guys aren't relevant either, so you don't understand.

585
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:20,860
Some people began to ask, why is this TV at all? And I think it's a potent question.

586
00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:25,860
Probably the easiest answer is simple, that being of entertainment, and obviously that's important as it drives

587
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:30,860
the core appeal of a lot of modern TV, having it can't be the only reason when there are other ethical queries

588
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:35,860
surrounding the subject. The Hunger Games is pretty entertaining for a lot of people, but there's also a reason why it's fictional.

589
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:42,860
Dr. Phil can showcase people at their weakest and most vulnerable, and although it's often used to drive home a positive message,

590
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:47,860
what sacrifice to a person's privacy and individual healing process is made to achieve that?

591
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:54,860
Sure, Dr. Phil raises awareness, but at what cost? A lot of people clearly had it in their head that there was some mutual benefit,

592
00:45:54,860 --> 00:46:00,860
coming on Dr. Phil was meant to be helpful, but the only people it was guaranteed to benefit were some viewers and the show itself.

593
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:06,860
I think the audience's self-assurance that Dr. Phil offered some unique brand of assistance was really meant to mask the fact that people

594
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:12,860
love to watch a car crash. There's a reason why the most successful Dr. Phil videos are the ones with the most heated confrontations.

595
00:46:12,860 --> 00:46:18,860
These videos all likely staying on YouTube for the rest of eternity, showing the behaviour of some extremely troubled people.

596
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:24,860
Sure, Dr. Phil was better than his trash TV contemporaries, but that didn't exactly make him a force for good,

597
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:30,860
and with his greater presence online, it also made it easier to reach with such criticisms, and many did just that.

598
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:35,860
So with all these different points in mind, both the positive and the negative, my question would be,

599
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:39,860
why would anyone believe that Phil McGraw knows something special?

600
00:46:39,860 --> 00:46:44,860
Many began to wonder what Dr. Phil was offering his guests that couldn't be offered elsewhere.

601
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:49,860
Well, I suppose the one thing was that any sort of treatment was not cheap in a place like the United States,

602
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:53,860
and Dr. Phil did offer a space for that, at the price of a bit of TV time.

603
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:59,860
Additionally, the therapy doesn't end on the Dr. Phil show, many would attest that he provides help beyond their TV appearance,

604
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:04,860
and for the children who McGraw felt were facing the most significant challenges, they would have an all-expenses-paid trip

605
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:08,860
to Turnabout Ranch, that was designed to help put kids on the right path.

606
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:13,860
Dr. Phil did offer something different to everyone else, and just because a person doesn't derive benefit,

607
00:47:13,860 --> 00:47:19,860
doesn't mean the formula in place can't help a majority of people, does it?

608
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:30,860
Okay, let's say the concept behind Dr. Phil is inherently flawed, there was no way that a show like this could possibly work

609
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:33,860
in favour of every guest because of how the public spotlight affects you.

610
00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:39,860
It would be fair to question its status on the principal alone, but is it fair to tar the entire show with the critical brush?

611
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:44,860
The least that some would argue is that McGraw and the producers involved did their best to mitigate the negative impact

612
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:47,860
that may be drawn towards individuals who were involved with the show.

613
00:47:48,860 --> 00:47:56,860
I'm not here to judge you, I'm here to help you. I'm here to help you.

614
00:47:56,860 --> 00:48:04,860
I'm here to do what your husband should have done all along the way, and that is to lead you out of this quagmire and into the light.

615
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:09,860
Dr. Phil himself was often outspoken in making sure people knew the help an individual would be receiving,

616
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:15,860
and like a lot of shows, conducted segments that revisited former participants to assess how their lives had changed since then.

617
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:16,860
So how are you doing?

618
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:21,860
Doing good, I am four months clean and sober for everything.

619
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:24,860
So glad to hear that.

620
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:32,860
It just puts courage and strength, and finally love myself, because you helped me figure that out.

621
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:35,860
Like, being able to do that has changed my life.

622
00:48:35,860 --> 00:48:40,860
It seemed that the consensus from a lot of guests was broadly positive, and that their appearance on Dr. Phil had prompted

623
00:48:40,860 --> 00:48:44,860
many of them to begin turning their lives around. It likely made viewers feel good about themselves,

624
00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:50,860
but as people began to dig, they realised that this outlook wasn't quite as universal as it was portrayed on TV,

625
00:48:50,860 --> 00:48:54,860
with some even suggesting that there had been serious failures regarding the safeguarding of guests.

626
00:48:54,860 --> 00:48:59,860
As noted, there have been several lawsuits and allegations that were published during the lifespan of the show,

627
00:48:59,860 --> 00:49:05,860
but as always, the problem with these is that when they're isolated, they're typically not high-profile enough to attract attention from the public.

628
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:09,860
However, when they can all be lined up in one place, a much clearer pattern can be established,

629
00:49:09,860 --> 00:49:12,860
and greater narratives can be expounded on the matter.

630
00:49:12,860 --> 00:49:17,860
With Dr. Phil under the spotlight as a whole, and the online world making it easier to access such information,

631
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:21,860
it wasn't long until people began picking apart the show's wholesome veneer.

632
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:26,860
The first aspect to go under the microscope was how the show managed the handling of its guests on air.

633
00:49:26,860 --> 00:49:33,860
Dr. Phil and the producers always made a point about the show being a safe space for an individual to speak openly about their trials and their trauma.

634
00:49:33,860 --> 00:49:37,860
However, some have begun to question whether that was truly the case in the last few years,

635
00:49:37,860 --> 00:49:40,860
or if chasing a story was more important to the people in question.

636
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:45,860
I must know why you and my step-sisters treat me with such contempt.

637
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:50,860
You know, I try to be kind and forgiving, but the nicer I am, the worse you treat me.

638
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:57,860
This is Shelley Duvall. A few decades ago, she was an A-list celebrity who had a successful and lucrative career in film and television.

639
00:49:57,860 --> 00:50:03,860
However, in 2002, she retired from acting and decided to live a life away from the limelight, making very few public appearances.

640
00:50:03,860 --> 00:50:09,860
Yet, in 2016, that changed, when she agreed to be interviewed by McGraw for an episode of Dr. Phil.

641
00:50:09,860 --> 00:50:12,860
What followed next was... something else.

642
00:50:12,860 --> 00:50:21,860
It's very confusing, very disturbing to me, because they started out with Ground Zero and Triple Zero.

643
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:29,860
It's like when a nun at some place tells you, you're almost Triple Zero, and she meant it!

644
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:36,860
And, anyway, everybody was already listening in on me, even from Santa Monica.

645
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:41,860
I should go without saying that what Duvall was experiencing was a serious episode of a mental breakdown,

646
00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:47,860
and she was in a clearly compromised state, to which it would be questionable whether she could even understand what was happening in that moment.

647
00:50:47,860 --> 00:50:54,860
Throughout the interview, McGraw continuously encourages and attempts to aid Duvall in finding help, for which Duvall seems incredibly reluctant.

648
00:50:54,860 --> 00:51:05,860
I want to check everything out. I want to make sure that you're healthy, and that you're feeling right, thinking right, sleeping right, eating right.

649
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:08,860
Do you take any medication?

650
00:51:08,860 --> 00:51:17,860
No. Will you quit trying to pin me with... She's a heavy drinker? She takes pills?

651
00:51:17,860 --> 00:51:21,860
Sit in your head. Come on, I see the V at the top there.

652
00:51:21,860 --> 00:51:22,860
Yeah, I got a bald head.

653
00:51:22,860 --> 00:51:23,860
That's a goose.

654
00:51:23,860 --> 00:51:28,860
You see, the reason I want to get you checked out is because...

655
00:51:28,860 --> 00:51:29,860
They're not tourniquets.

656
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:42,860
If your hair is thinning, and you're feeling pain, I want to help you. I want to get you to some doctors that can really check you out.

657
00:51:42,860 --> 00:51:45,860
It's a physical problem. Physical.

658
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:46,860
I want to check you out physically.

659
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:50,860
And I don't want any more B-Bites, because they threaten me, but I'm not afraid of them.

660
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:57,860
I'm not going to focus on this interview too much, but it caught the attention of some high profile figures, including Stanley Kubrick's daughter,

661
00:51:57,860 --> 00:52:02,860
and actress Maya Farrow, who both criticised the broadcast of someone clearly at such a vulnerable point in their life.

662
00:52:02,860 --> 00:52:05,860
I think, however, it was more indicative of the show.

663
00:52:05,860 --> 00:52:10,860
Shelly, listen to me. Will you let me get you to some doctors?

664
00:52:11,860 --> 00:52:13,860
I was a pretty girl. I was beautiful.

665
00:52:13,860 --> 00:52:20,860
I was 1987 Entertainer of the Year for the Southern California Cable Television Association.

666
00:52:20,860 --> 00:52:22,860
Will you let me get you to some doctors?

667
00:52:22,860 --> 00:52:24,860
Not as a prisoner, you're not.

668
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:27,860
Of course not. You can come and go anytime you want.

669
00:52:27,860 --> 00:52:30,860
What was wrong with the doctors I had?

670
00:52:30,860 --> 00:52:32,860
We haven't seen doctors for a good while.

671
00:52:32,860 --> 00:52:35,860
But I'd rather see my doctor than your doctor.

672
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:38,860
Well, but I've got some really good doctors.

673
00:52:38,860 --> 00:52:39,860
You do?

674
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:41,860
Yeah. Can I fix this?

675
00:52:41,860 --> 00:52:47,860
I don't know if McGraw is charging by the hour, but this interview almost seems too motivated to get Shelly help,

676
00:52:47,860 --> 00:52:51,860
and I use the quotation marks there, because help is subjective depending on the person.

677
00:52:51,860 --> 00:52:54,860
What might help one person isn't guaranteed to help another person.

678
00:52:54,860 --> 00:52:59,860
Throughout the interview, Dr Phil seems determined to get Duval to this one centre in particular,

679
00:52:59,860 --> 00:53:03,860
which ultimately fails because once she's there, Duval is not comfortable receiving help there,

680
00:53:03,860 --> 00:53:06,860
and at the end of the episode, he reveals that they're supporting her at home anyway.

681
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:10,860
Dr Phil runs through a manual that dictates operations regardless of the individual,

682
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:16,860
it's manufactured to maintain those narratives, but what happens when that aspect is pushed to obsessive degrees?

683
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:23,860
There have been a couple of instances in the past where the producers of Dr Phil were accused of facilitating people's problems rather than helping them.

684
00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:27,860
In 2008, a member of the Dr Phil team was caught paying towards a violent teen's bail,

685
00:53:27,860 --> 00:53:30,860
and although they subsequently cancelled the story, let's be frank here,

686
00:53:30,860 --> 00:53:33,860
it was no secret the lengths the show would go to to get a scoop.

687
00:53:33,860 --> 00:53:39,860
Yet another high profile case seemed to take the biscuit, and it once again involved another public figure.

688
00:53:39,860 --> 00:53:44,860
This is Todd Herzog, he was the victor of the 15th season of Survivor, set in China.

689
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:51,860
However, after his success, he had struggled with alcoholism, during which his mother had contacted Dr Phil for help with her son's problem.

690
00:53:51,860 --> 00:53:55,860
However, when he turned up to the studio, he was intoxicated to the point of incomprehension.

691
00:53:55,860 --> 00:53:59,860
McGraw was sure to bring attention to this and the serious danger he was in.

692
00:53:59,860 --> 00:54:09,860
So yeah, I'm okay, because I didn't know this was happening right now.

693
00:54:09,860 --> 00:54:12,860
You're not okay?

694
00:54:12,860 --> 00:54:13,860
No.

695
00:54:13,860 --> 00:54:17,860
You said you're okay, but you're not okay. You're not even almost okay.

696
00:54:17,860 --> 00:54:18,860
No.

697
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:19,860
Do you know who I am?

698
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:22,860
Yeah, of course I know who you are.

699
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:35,860
You are here, because I wanted to talk to you, because in my opinion, you're killing yourself, man.

700
00:54:35,860 --> 00:54:43,860
I want to get a fix on you right now, so I know what I'm dealing with. This is a breathalyzer.

701
00:54:43,860 --> 00:54:50,860
I want you to blow into it really hard for five seconds when I tell you, so I can see where you are.

702
00:54:50,860 --> 00:54:55,860
Once again, after a brief consultation, Dr Phil emphasizes how he's going to find him help, and to be fair,

703
00:54:55,860 --> 00:54:59,860
in this case, it's probably not the wrong sort of help, and after receiving treatment,

704
00:54:59,860 --> 00:55:04,860
Todd makes his appearance on the show as a sober individual and expresses his gratitude for the intervention.

705
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:10,860
However, a couple years later, in 2016, he appears on the show once more after relapsing.

706
00:55:11,860 --> 00:55:18,860
At 2.30 this morning, you had a blood alcohol level of 0.432.

707
00:55:20,860 --> 00:55:21,860
Yeah.

708
00:55:22,860 --> 00:55:23,860
And?

709
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:29,860
One week squared is 0.601.

710
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:32,860
That's...

711
00:55:32,860 --> 00:55:33,860
Death.

712
00:55:33,860 --> 00:55:34,860
That's death.

713
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:35,860
That's death.

714
00:55:35,860 --> 00:55:39,860
It's always somewhat tragic to see a person struggling so much on live TV.

715
00:55:39,860 --> 00:55:45,860
However, in 2017, Herzog went public with the claim that his struggle had been orchestrated by the Dr Phil producers,

716
00:55:45,860 --> 00:55:49,860
who planned a bottle of vodka in his dressing room during both interventions.

717
00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:54,860
I show up to the studios, and I'm sober, I'm hurting a lot, and I'm shaking.

718
00:55:54,860 --> 00:55:58,860
My dad was there, and I went and talked to him in his dressing room, and I was completely sober.

719
00:55:58,860 --> 00:56:06,860
And then they pull me into my dressing room, and there was two liters of vodka and, like, some Red Bulls and orange juice and stuff like that.

720
00:56:06,860 --> 00:56:13,860
You know, being unsupervised by my parents, I drank the entire bottle.

721
00:56:15,860 --> 00:56:17,860
And then at some point, somebody gave me a Xanax.

722
00:56:17,860 --> 00:56:19,860
They said, this will calm your nerves.

723
00:56:19,860 --> 00:56:25,860
And so I had been drinking and took a Xanax, which I've never taken Xanax before in my life,

724
00:56:26,860 --> 00:56:30,860
and I know that can be a deadly combination, so why it was given to me, I don't know.

725
00:56:30,860 --> 00:56:35,860
I get that it's a television show, and that they want to show the pain that I'm in.

726
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:40,860
However, what would have happened if I died there, you know?

727
00:56:40,860 --> 00:56:44,860
This seemed to paint a very different portrait than the one that was perceived,

728
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:51,860
and in both cases of Devana Herzog seemed to tell us something extremely different about the intent of McGraw and those around him.

729
00:56:56,860 --> 00:57:02,860
The irony is that perfect television is often the moments that probably shouldn't even be there.

730
00:57:02,860 --> 00:57:07,860
People want something that is raw and real, and often that can't happen naturally in front of a TV camera.

731
00:57:07,860 --> 00:57:09,860
So when it does, it's all the more powerful.

732
00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:14,860
In the case of Herzog and De Waal, what we saw were two people who were clearly suffering from something serious,

733
00:57:14,860 --> 00:57:17,860
and its coverage, for many, was extremely riveting.

734
00:57:17,860 --> 00:57:21,860
However, in both cases, it's fair to question how fair it truly was.

735
00:57:22,860 --> 00:57:25,860
Is this going to be a murder? Are you going to murder me?

736
00:57:25,860 --> 00:57:30,860
This looks deserted. Leave me alone. I don't want to be murdered.

737
00:57:30,860 --> 00:57:32,860
We would never murder you.

738
00:57:32,860 --> 00:57:35,860
You stop driving, and I'm going to have a cigarette.

739
00:57:35,860 --> 00:57:38,860
Fire hazard area, no fire hazard area.

740
00:57:38,860 --> 00:57:43,860
If you're smoke-enders, Patrick Reynolds warned me about you.

741
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:48,860
In the case of De Waal, trying to ship her off to some facility that may not have been suitable for her problems,

742
00:57:48,860 --> 00:57:52,860
and in the case of Herzog, allegedly exploiting a vulnerability for drama.

743
00:57:52,860 --> 00:57:55,860
And although I cannot comment for certain on the verity of the claim,

744
00:57:55,860 --> 00:57:59,860
is it not suspicious that despite being surrounded by a full TV crew,

745
00:57:59,860 --> 00:58:01,860
a family who probably didn't want him to consume alcohol,

746
00:58:01,860 --> 00:58:04,860
and experts who were supposedly worried for his health,

747
00:58:04,860 --> 00:58:06,860
that he still turned up drunk?

748
00:58:06,860 --> 00:58:09,860
I understand if you can't completely control a person,

749
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:12,860
but if the safeguarding measures were up to scratch,

750
00:58:12,860 --> 00:58:15,860
like producers had claimed in other interviews surrounding this matter,

751
00:58:15,860 --> 00:58:18,860
there is no way he should have arrived at that studio intoxicated,

752
00:58:18,860 --> 00:58:20,860
and yet it happened twice.

753
00:58:20,860 --> 00:58:23,860
In both of these high-profile situations,

754
00:58:23,860 --> 00:58:27,860
it seems the authenticity was merely a front for something more manufactured,

755
00:58:27,860 --> 00:58:31,860
a conflict that wasn't necessary for the discourse that everyone seemed so concerned about,

756
00:58:31,860 --> 00:58:34,860
but more so allowed producers to raise stakes in dramatic narratives

757
00:58:34,860 --> 00:58:38,860
that emphasised the urgency of the situations that these guests found themselves in,

758
00:58:38,860 --> 00:58:42,860
and to be honest, if McGraw hadn't landed himself in the controversy while consulting Britney,

759
00:58:42,860 --> 00:58:45,860
the producers may well have done a similar thing with her.

760
00:58:45,860 --> 00:58:49,860
Dr. Phil's handling of high-profile individuals was what initially drew the most controversy,

761
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:54,860
after all, they're the ones who most often have a platform to speak out if they experience maltreatment,

762
00:58:54,860 --> 00:58:57,860
however, as with other situations I acknowledged earlier,

763
00:58:57,860 --> 00:58:59,860
it's very hard to say how far this went back,

764
00:58:59,860 --> 00:59:02,860
and it's doubtful that it was an isolated incident,

765
00:59:02,860 --> 00:59:04,860
and other stories suggested they weren't.

766
00:59:04,860 --> 00:59:08,860
I thought Dr. Phil was gonna save my daughter, and it did not happen.

767
00:59:08,860 --> 00:59:11,860
This is Joelle, she's a mother who brought her pregnant daughter on the show

768
00:59:11,860 --> 00:59:14,860
to hopefully get some help for her heroin addiction.

769
00:59:14,860 --> 00:59:16,860
She claims she was promised round-the-clock supervision,

770
00:59:16,860 --> 00:59:20,860
however, when her daughter began to detox, she didn't receive that.

771
00:59:26,860 --> 00:59:31,860
After about four hours, Caitlin decided that she was gonna leave,

772
00:59:31,860 --> 00:59:36,860
and we needed to go to get her something so that she would not withdraw

773
00:59:36,860 --> 00:59:38,860
because it would hurt the baby at that point.

774
00:59:38,860 --> 00:59:42,860
Not receiving help for four hours at a hospital and fearing for the safety of the baby,

775
00:59:42,860 --> 00:59:46,860
Joelle felt she had no other option but to get her daughter immediately from heroin,

776
00:59:46,860 --> 00:59:51,860
at which point they were transported to Skid Row with the camera person who filmed the entire ordeal.

777
00:59:51,860 --> 00:59:53,860
They're arriving now.

778
00:59:58,860 --> 01:00:00,860
Care to death right now.

779
01:00:00,860 --> 01:00:02,860
Caitlin made a contact very quickly,

780
01:00:02,860 --> 01:00:05,860
I gave her money, and she went on her way.

781
01:00:05,860 --> 01:00:09,860
Approximately 30-45 minutes later, we found her.

782
01:00:09,860 --> 01:00:14,860
She was happy, high, and we went back to the hotel at that point.

783
01:00:14,860 --> 01:00:16,860
This was subsequently brought up on the show,

784
01:00:16,860 --> 01:00:20,860
where McGraw chastises the mother for leaving the hospital and heading to Skid Row,

785
01:00:20,860 --> 01:00:22,860
which, obviously, is not a safe place.

786
01:00:22,860 --> 01:00:26,860
You think since her mom is a nurse, she would take her to the hospital,

787
01:00:26,860 --> 01:00:28,860
but instead, they made a drug run.

788
01:00:28,860 --> 01:00:31,860
I just wanted to help her feel better.

789
01:00:31,860 --> 01:00:34,860
So that baby is high on heroin right now.

790
01:00:34,860 --> 01:00:38,860
I can't alert LAPD before you walk off of this stage.

791
01:00:38,860 --> 01:00:41,860
So you think forcing someone to get help like that is the best way?

792
01:00:41,860 --> 01:00:44,860
I don't give a... what you think.

793
01:00:44,860 --> 01:00:46,860
I'm concerned about your baby.

794
01:00:46,860 --> 01:00:50,860
In this case, though, the mother claims she was cornered with how to treat the situation,

795
01:00:50,860 --> 01:00:53,860
and told that if she had questioned aspects of the show that had caused her to take such measures,

796
01:00:53,860 --> 01:00:56,860
her daughter wouldn't be able to receive the help that she needed.

797
01:00:56,860 --> 01:01:00,860
There was a lot of manipulation, telling us what to say,

798
01:01:00,860 --> 01:01:03,860
telling us how to act, telling us what to do.

799
01:01:03,860 --> 01:01:06,860
I don't have an answer for why I did what I did.

800
01:01:06,860 --> 01:01:08,860
I just wanted to help her feel better.

801
01:01:08,860 --> 01:01:11,860
I was told, do not question anything he's saying,

802
01:01:11,860 --> 01:01:14,860
or he could not give her the help that she needed.

803
01:01:14,860 --> 01:01:18,860
How much is going to have to be lost before you pull your head?

804
01:01:18,860 --> 01:01:19,860
This is it.

805
01:01:19,860 --> 01:01:22,860
I'm not going to mince my words here.

806
01:01:22,860 --> 01:01:23,860
That's a threat.

807
01:01:23,860 --> 01:01:25,860
There is no two ways about it.

808
01:01:25,860 --> 01:01:26,860
This person isn't a celebrity.

809
01:01:26,860 --> 01:01:28,860
They're not copiously wealthy.

810
01:01:28,860 --> 01:01:31,860
What Dr. Phil is offering these people is a chance to receive serious help,

811
01:01:31,860 --> 01:01:36,860
to hold that over someone's head if they don't comply with your request to make sure Phillip's reputation

812
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:38,860
remains unscathed is extremely inhumane.

813
01:01:38,860 --> 01:01:40,860
Now, once again, this is just an allegation,

814
01:01:40,860 --> 01:01:45,860
but it certainly fits in with this idea that the producers were chasing a story and a reputation,

815
01:01:45,860 --> 01:01:49,860
rather than prioritising the help they often advocated for on the show.

816
01:01:49,860 --> 01:01:53,860
In the case of Joelle and her daughter, even if it didn't happen exactly as reported,

817
01:01:53,860 --> 01:01:56,860
they were still escorted to skid row with a cameraman.

818
01:01:56,860 --> 01:02:00,860
If there was proper medical supervision like the Dr. Phil show claimed,

819
01:02:00,860 --> 01:02:02,860
how the hell did they end up there?

820
01:02:02,860 --> 01:02:07,860
Responding to the claims, Martin Greenberg, a psychologist who is head of the show's personal affairs,

821
01:02:07,860 --> 01:02:13,860
stated that officials only agreed to do the show if Joelle agreed to be responsible for her daughter's withdrawal,

822
01:02:13,860 --> 01:02:15,860
which seems really weird from my perspective.

823
01:02:15,860 --> 01:02:17,860
Surely that's what the medical professionals would be for,

824
01:02:17,860 --> 01:02:21,860
and if you think someone is at any risk, you wouldn't bring them down at all.

825
01:02:21,860 --> 01:02:26,860
Washing your hands of contractual culpability doesn't suddenly absolve you of any moral obligation.

826
01:02:26,860 --> 01:02:31,860
Maybe as an entertainer that's a risk you would take, but certainly not as a person whose job is to keep people safe.

827
01:02:31,860 --> 01:02:35,860
As a head of personal affairs, Greenberg is surprisingly bad at PR,

828
01:02:35,860 --> 01:02:40,860
including providing seemingly confused and conflicting responses to claims about patient safeguarding.

829
01:02:40,860 --> 01:02:45,860
Most of his responses reek of arrogance and dismissiveness towards the complaints they've been receiving,

830
01:02:45,860 --> 01:02:49,860
though I'll give them credit because they do still emphasise personal responsibility.

831
01:02:49,860 --> 01:02:53,860
In saying that these people are not willing to take responsibility for themselves,

832
01:02:53,860 --> 01:02:56,860
I think it would be valid to flip the question in this case, and say,

833
01:02:56,860 --> 01:02:59,860
is it not them who are not willing to take responsibility?

834
01:02:59,860 --> 01:03:04,860
In attempting to explain why they may not be aware of whether a guest is at risk from their cravings,

835
01:03:04,860 --> 01:03:07,860
Greenberg states, and I love this one,

836
01:03:07,860 --> 01:03:10,860
addicts are notorious for lying, deflecting, and trivialising,

837
01:03:10,860 --> 01:03:14,860
but if they are at risk when they arrive, then they were at risk before they arrived.

838
01:03:14,860 --> 01:03:19,860
I've been trying to save the opinion part for later, but this is just such a rotten thing to say.

839
01:03:19,860 --> 01:03:23,860
Sure, sometimes addicts struggle with being open about their problems,

840
01:03:23,860 --> 01:03:27,860
but the fact they came to your show probably means they want help,

841
01:03:27,860 --> 01:03:29,860
and it doesn't mean they're not deserving of it.

842
01:03:29,860 --> 01:03:35,860
For you to make a general ad hominem attack to deflect responsibility from the show is cowardly,

843
01:03:35,860 --> 01:03:38,860
and I would expect better from a psychologist.

844
01:03:38,860 --> 01:03:42,860
If you're aware of that behaviour, then surely that is reason for you to heighten the supervision,

845
01:03:42,860 --> 01:03:46,860
not just leave them to their own devices and then shrug your shoulders.

846
01:03:46,860 --> 01:03:51,860
The Dr Phil show cannot guarantee the eternal safety of all who attend their show,

847
01:03:51,860 --> 01:03:54,860
however, they could at least ensure it on the premises.

848
01:03:54,860 --> 01:03:58,860
Instead, guests turned up drunk, trips to Skid Row were made with a camera crew,

849
01:03:58,860 --> 01:04:03,860
and the narrative of help was pushed to nauseating and even allegedly threatening degrees.

850
01:04:03,860 --> 01:04:09,860
Sure, it was perfect TV, but what was happening behind the cameras?

851
01:04:09,860 --> 01:04:12,860
How truly helpful was that help?

852
01:04:40,860 --> 01:04:42,860
There is no but.

853
01:04:42,860 --> 01:04:48,860
You either want the help or you don't, and if you want the help, you lean into it,

854
01:04:48,860 --> 01:04:51,860
and you don't get back here. There's no pass and go.

855
01:04:51,860 --> 01:04:54,860
You leave from here to there.

856
01:04:54,860 --> 01:04:58,860
That requires very specialized care that I think you deserve.

857
01:04:58,860 --> 01:05:02,860
I want you to have that help. I want this baby to have that help.

858
01:05:02,860 --> 01:05:09,860
I am offering you the best help, in my opinion, in the United States.

859
01:05:09,860 --> 01:05:11,860
Right.

860
01:05:11,860 --> 01:05:13,860
And...

861
01:05:13,860 --> 01:05:15,860
Please.

862
01:05:15,860 --> 01:05:17,860
But...

863
01:05:17,860 --> 01:05:19,860
Just say yes.

864
01:05:19,860 --> 01:05:20,860
Stop talking to me.

865
01:05:20,860 --> 01:05:23,860
I'm not here to be unfair or ignore the greater picture,

866
01:05:23,860 --> 01:05:27,860
and I do want to acknowledge that there are plenty of people who will credit the Dr Phil show

867
01:05:27,860 --> 01:05:29,860
for the difference it has made in their lives.

868
01:05:29,860 --> 01:05:32,860
In discussing the subject of antics on the show, Greenberg says,

869
01:05:32,860 --> 01:05:35,860
the only change is they are one step closer to getting help,

870
01:05:35,860 --> 01:05:38,860
typically help they could not even come close to affording.

871
01:05:38,860 --> 01:05:42,860
Greenberg presents the help the show is offering as a privilege.

872
01:05:42,860 --> 01:05:48,860
Now, I know the health system is pretty broken, and that in many ways, it is a privilege to be seen so quickly.

873
01:05:48,860 --> 01:05:50,860
With that said, it's a mutual thing.

874
01:05:50,860 --> 01:05:53,860
Greenberg speaks like it's an act of charity,

875
01:05:53,860 --> 01:05:57,860
but really, it's the least they can do for people who have fueled their daytime ratings.

876
01:05:57,860 --> 01:06:02,860
In defending the show, Greenberg admits that appearing on Dr Phil is a step towards receiving the assistance

877
01:06:02,860 --> 01:06:05,860
many typically desire to conquer their demons,

878
01:06:05,860 --> 01:06:07,860
but Dr Phil isn't the endgame, he's the middleman,

879
01:06:07,860 --> 01:06:12,860
and the success of the TV show has given them the power to also find treatment for their subject.

880
01:06:12,860 --> 01:06:16,860
Now though, to touch on the fact that healthcare on this front can be very expensive,

881
01:06:16,860 --> 01:06:19,860
as Greenberg acknowledges, there is a financial factor behind the show,

882
01:06:19,860 --> 01:06:23,860
and Dr Phil has never really ran on a patient-based formula.

883
01:06:23,860 --> 01:06:28,860
Yes my friends, there is a mystery third beneficiary to the sort of service being offered by Dr Phil,

884
01:06:28,860 --> 01:06:31,860
that being the treatment facilities that these people are sent to,

885
01:06:31,860 --> 01:06:35,860
many of whom advertise their relationship with the esteemed Dr Phil.

886
01:06:35,860 --> 01:06:40,860
If certain people can afford it, these places have just been given the promotion for the help they offer.

887
01:06:40,860 --> 01:06:45,860
When a guest comes on, Dr Phil will sometimes express to the viewers exactly what treatment facility

888
01:06:45,860 --> 01:06:49,860
that person is being sent to, and the positive difference that it will make.

889
01:06:49,860 --> 01:06:54,860
Such promotions are like a sponsorship really, and many media and even YouTube figures do sponsorships

890
01:06:54,860 --> 01:06:58,860
with some very curious companies, and most of us know that we need to take them with a grain of salt.

891
01:06:58,860 --> 01:07:02,860
Dr Phil, like many people, is a guy who is attempting to acquire the bag,

892
01:07:02,860 --> 01:07:05,860
and honestly, there are worse things that he could promote.

893
01:07:05,860 --> 01:07:10,860
If you're looking for something to do that's fun, relaxing, and good for your brain,

894
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:16,860
I have a perfect way for you to take a much needed break, and it's right on your phone for free.

895
01:07:17,860 --> 01:07:20,860
It's an app game called Solitaire Grand Harvest.

896
01:07:20,860 --> 01:07:25,860
Now, I have two guests here who say they play and love this game.

897
01:07:25,860 --> 01:07:29,860
At the same time, such an endorsement does come with a degree of responsibility,

898
01:07:29,860 --> 01:07:32,860
especially given the sensitive subjects that are often handled.

899
01:07:32,860 --> 01:07:35,860
Was that due diligence being performed?

900
01:07:35,860 --> 01:07:38,860
Well, the show seems to have agreements with a few facilities for treatment,

901
01:07:38,860 --> 01:07:41,860
which Dr Phil of course sings his praises about,

902
01:07:41,860 --> 01:07:47,860
but maybe they're perfectly qualified people, but there is a quite close relationship between Dr Phil and a lot of these places.

903
01:07:47,860 --> 01:07:52,860
Now, one size never fits all, and there will always be people who will not find recovery in a treatment center,

904
01:07:52,860 --> 01:07:57,860
and although I think there have been instances where McGraw was a little too enthusiastic about specific clinics,

905
01:07:57,860 --> 01:08:02,860
see Duval, I understand that having a close relationship with specific places is probably for the best,

906
01:08:02,860 --> 01:08:05,860
as it would allow one to maintain the highest quality of treatment.

907
01:08:05,860 --> 01:08:07,860
However, was that high quality being delivered?

908
01:08:07,860 --> 01:08:10,860
The problem is that once you tie yourself to specific institutions,

909
01:08:10,860 --> 01:08:14,860
if the reputations of these places do come under scrutiny, it can reflect on you,

910
01:08:14,860 --> 01:08:17,860
even if you're not involved in the management of the facility itself.

911
01:08:17,860 --> 01:08:21,860
Obviously, there are factors that people can't be expected to be aware of,

912
01:08:21,860 --> 01:08:24,860
yet over time, some believe this should have been fairly obvious.

913
01:08:24,860 --> 01:08:27,860
Dr Lawless, stand up, would you please?

914
01:08:27,860 --> 01:08:31,860
This is Dr Frank Lawless, head of the Psychoneuroplasticity Center,

915
01:08:31,860 --> 01:08:36,860
which is a long, long way of saying they check people from A to Z.

916
01:08:36,860 --> 01:08:41,860
The first query that one may raise is the actual suitability of many of these facilities for Dr Phil.

917
01:08:41,860 --> 01:08:45,860
Now, McGraw hails from Texas, and many of his connections are from around that area,

918
01:08:45,860 --> 01:08:51,860
such as the origins clinic, and the arbor, both of whom have facilities in Big Philly's home states.

919
01:08:51,860 --> 01:08:56,860
Greenberg states that if a person requires medical attention, they will fly in the required medical personnel,

920
01:08:56,860 --> 01:08:58,860
however, there seems to be a bit of disconnect with this system.

921
01:08:58,860 --> 01:09:04,860
Although Herzog received his treatment from the arbor, Steve Thomason, who is the director of the facility,

922
01:09:04,860 --> 01:09:08,860
has stated that Herzog did not and could not have received supervision on the show from them,

923
01:09:08,860 --> 01:09:10,860
because they're not licensed in California.

924
01:09:10,860 --> 01:09:14,860
In fact, Thomason states he completely regrets agreeing to working with the show in the first place,

925
01:09:14,860 --> 01:09:17,860
and was so upset by the segment that he never agreed to work with them again.

926
01:09:17,860 --> 01:09:19,860
This doesn't mean that Herzog wasn't supervised,

927
01:09:19,860 --> 01:09:25,860
but it certainly created a disconnect between two entities that should be laboring towards a collective goal.

928
01:09:25,860 --> 01:09:28,860
If a company is required to regularly supervise individuals in California,

929
01:09:28,860 --> 01:09:31,860
should they not be licensed to do so in that state as well?

930
01:09:31,860 --> 01:09:33,860
Are there not more suitable alternatives?

931
01:09:33,860 --> 01:09:35,860
I want to introduce someone to you.

932
01:09:35,860 --> 01:09:37,860
This is Mike Gurr down here.

933
01:09:37,860 --> 01:09:39,860
He's the executive director at the Meadows Ranch,

934
01:09:39,860 --> 01:09:47,860
and I've asked him to come here today because I've worked with Meadows for years,

935
01:09:47,860 --> 01:09:50,860
and they, in my opinion, are the best of the best,

936
01:09:50,860 --> 01:09:55,860
and I wanted you to have an opportunity to sit down and talk with them

937
01:09:56,860 --> 01:10:03,860
and see if you feel like this might be a good opportunity for you.

938
01:10:03,860 --> 01:10:08,860
You can't exactly blame Dr. Phil for involving prior business relationships in his present day ventures,

939
01:10:08,860 --> 01:10:11,860
especially if he holds them in higher regard like he regularly claims he does.

940
01:10:11,860 --> 01:10:15,860
However, business shouldn't really be the central matter of the TV show,

941
01:10:15,860 --> 01:10:17,860
yet that's what some believed it to be,

942
01:10:17,860 --> 01:10:20,860
particularly given Dr. Phil's presence as a brand.

943
01:10:20,860 --> 01:10:23,860
The Boston Globe, who had published some of the most critical content of McGraw

944
01:10:23,860 --> 01:10:27,860
during his social media renaissance, touched on this in a 2017 article

945
01:10:27,860 --> 01:10:32,860
when covering the recent Dr. Phil path to recovery VR headset marketing shebang.

946
01:10:32,860 --> 01:10:38,860
You're going to see on the screens what Eric is seeing in the goggles.

947
01:10:38,860 --> 01:10:40,860
Now, this is prerecorded.

948
01:10:40,860 --> 01:10:43,860
Okay, Eric, look up.

949
01:10:43,860 --> 01:10:45,860
Now look to your left.

950
01:10:45,860 --> 01:10:47,860
This is what he's seeing.

951
01:10:47,860 --> 01:10:51,860
Now, what I've done here is I've put them in a bar situation.

952
01:10:51,860 --> 01:10:54,860
So while they're in rehab, they're sitting talking to me in a bar.

953
01:10:54,860 --> 01:10:57,860
Now they're sitting and this is actually in my backyard.

954
01:10:57,860 --> 01:11:02,860
The Dr. Phil path to recovery VR headset is a system that supposedly aids addicts

955
01:11:02,860 --> 01:11:04,860
with an interactive form of therapy with the man himself.

956
01:11:04,860 --> 01:11:06,860
Although admittedly hard to establish,

957
01:11:06,860 --> 01:11:10,860
there is no epidemiological evidence to show that it is successful,

958
01:11:10,860 --> 01:11:13,860
but the Boston Globe claimed that there was one distinctive benefit,

959
01:11:13,860 --> 01:11:15,860
that being the Dr. Phil namesake.

960
01:11:15,860 --> 01:11:18,860
In reports, one potential client had informed the publication

961
01:11:18,860 --> 01:11:21,860
that the selling point presented to them had been just that,

962
01:11:21,860 --> 01:11:25,860
being told by the vice president for product sales that our job is to get your phones to ring,

963
01:11:25,860 --> 01:11:27,860
and the admissions hopefully follow.

964
01:11:27,860 --> 01:11:32,860
In essence, if you use the product, Dr. Phil is more likely to involve you on the TV show.

965
01:11:32,860 --> 01:11:34,860
The crew at Dr. Phil swiftly denied this,

966
01:11:34,860 --> 01:11:38,860
citing the fact that only two centers that use the product had even been mentioned on the TV show,

967
01:11:38,860 --> 01:11:40,860
and they never made promises.

968
01:11:40,860 --> 01:11:45,860
Nevertheless, they evaded responding on the matter of the actual comments made by the sales BP,

969
01:11:45,860 --> 01:11:48,860
and their response doesn't really contradict the report.

970
01:11:48,860 --> 01:11:51,860
It was never claimed that any promises were made or that a mention was guaranteed,

971
01:11:51,860 --> 01:11:57,860
and using a reference who had been mentioned thus far isn't proof against what will be mentioned in the future.

972
01:11:57,860 --> 01:12:00,860
Whether the VP was acting beyond his brief is certainly up for debate,

973
01:12:00,860 --> 01:12:03,860
but it's hard to doubt that comments were probably made.

974
01:12:03,860 --> 01:12:08,860
The Dr. Phil show always pursued the image of the program that was willing to put the mental health of its guests

975
01:12:08,860 --> 01:12:10,860
at the heart of its message.

976
01:12:10,860 --> 01:12:13,860
However, in many cases, it was clear that there was a conflict of interests,

977
01:12:13,860 --> 01:12:17,860
and what may be best for the show and those behind it may not be the best for the guests,

978
01:12:17,860 --> 01:12:23,860
and on closer analysis, in some cases, the places promoted were very questionable indeed.

979
01:12:32,860 --> 01:12:36,860
I'll discuss this more soon, but I think besides obviously people who are suffering from substance issues,

980
01:12:36,860 --> 01:12:40,860
another extremely vulnerable group are the youth, in particular those who have been brought on by their parents,

981
01:12:40,860 --> 01:12:43,860
as it may not have been their own first course of action.

982
01:12:43,860 --> 01:12:47,860
Now in many cases, when dealing with difficult children, adolescents, and even young adults,

983
01:12:47,860 --> 01:12:53,860
they're experiencing a lot of hormonal and developmental changes, something that Dr. Phil is quite aware of.

984
01:13:11,860 --> 01:13:14,860
Your job is to protect your child.

985
01:13:14,860 --> 01:13:17,860
I'll probably discuss the morality involving young people in a bit,

986
01:13:17,860 --> 01:13:21,860
but for guests really, as influential as a conversation with Dr. Phil may be,

987
01:13:21,860 --> 01:13:23,860
the main change is going to come from actually receiving treatment,

988
01:13:23,860 --> 01:13:28,860
and in that case, the centres are essential to making sure the chances of this happening are maximised,

989
01:13:28,860 --> 01:13:32,860
and although it won't work for everyone, these individuals are kept safe and well.

990
01:13:32,860 --> 01:13:35,860
Now in its time, Dr. Phil has recommended a few places,

991
01:13:35,860 --> 01:13:38,860
and for most adult facilities, there weren't too many controversies,

992
01:13:38,860 --> 01:13:43,860
but in the last few years there has been a bit of disquiet about two institutes that McGraw has had long-term relationships with,

993
01:13:43,860 --> 01:13:46,860
both of which specialise in treating children with substance issues.

994
01:13:46,860 --> 01:13:50,860
The first is a place in Florida, oh dear, called Inspirations.

995
01:13:50,860 --> 01:13:56,860
They have been featured on the Dr. Phil show, and have also coincidentally used the Dr. Phil Road to Recovery VR headset.

996
01:13:56,860 --> 01:14:00,860
In their appearances on the show, McGraw was highly complimentary about the work they were doing.

997
01:14:00,860 --> 01:14:06,860
This is Karen Walsh, she's the owner of Inspirations for Youth and Families.

998
01:14:06,860 --> 01:14:10,860
It's the nation's leading family addiction treatment and dual diagnosis centre,

999
01:14:10,860 --> 01:14:15,860
and affiliate of the Cove Centre for Recovery in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

1000
01:14:15,860 --> 01:14:19,860
And fair enough, if they're doing that work, then they deserve to receive their due credit.

1001
01:14:19,860 --> 01:14:21,860
However, some of the evidence suggested otherwise.

1002
01:14:21,860 --> 01:14:26,860
Beyond the owner's own legal issues, much of which happened during the years that Dr. Phil claimed to be working with them,

1003
01:14:26,860 --> 01:14:29,860
there was a more concerning issue regarding the centre itself.

1004
01:14:29,860 --> 01:14:32,860
We're at Inspirations for Youth and Families,

1005
01:14:32,860 --> 01:14:37,860
and what we do is we work with teenagers and their families every day,

1006
01:14:37,860 --> 01:14:45,860
and we help them to figure out how they're going to get past this point in their life where a teenager is struggling with drugs.

1007
01:14:45,860 --> 01:14:50,860
Now it's important that I keep this in perspective, it's a challenge to treat anyone who may struggle with addiction,

1008
01:14:50,860 --> 01:14:54,860
particularly if you're trying to put them back on the slope to a normal functioning life.

1009
01:14:54,860 --> 01:14:57,860
They need guidance, but you can't afford to be too authoritarian,

1010
01:14:57,860 --> 01:15:01,860
therefore it is possible that patients may flee the premises, and needs to be found.

1011
01:15:01,860 --> 01:15:04,860
With this in mind, Inspirations' record on this was a bit less than stellar,

1012
01:15:04,860 --> 01:15:07,860
according to a private investigator who worked within this industry.

1013
01:15:07,860 --> 01:15:14,860
In 2017, it was estimated that approximately 180 police reports for missing teenagers have been made in the space of the previous two years,

1014
01:15:14,860 --> 01:15:19,860
some of whom went missing for days and others ending up on the wrong side of the law completely.

1015
01:15:19,860 --> 01:15:24,860
To quote the PI, obviously there's a gap somewhere, a loophole somewhere in the system where they're just leaving.

1016
01:15:24,860 --> 01:15:27,860
Since these articles, Inspiration doesn't appear to have received much coverage,

1017
01:15:27,860 --> 01:15:30,860
and the video where their work was promoted has the comments disabled.

1018
01:15:30,860 --> 01:15:33,860
How with all this information available, it is fair to ask the question,

1019
01:15:33,860 --> 01:15:38,860
why Dr. Phil decided to characterise the institution as a leading family addiction centre?

1020
01:15:38,860 --> 01:15:41,860
How do you even know who's leading? Is there a leaderboard?

1021
01:15:41,860 --> 01:15:45,860
If there is, I highly doubt Inspirations is near the top, but I digress.

1022
01:15:45,860 --> 01:15:50,860
Inspirations is an example of a place that has some function but falters in its execution,

1023
01:15:50,860 --> 01:15:53,860
which is pretty vital given the sort of people they're meant to be treating,

1024
01:15:53,860 --> 01:15:56,860
and although nobody has come forward with any horror stories,

1025
01:15:56,860 --> 01:16:00,860
it shouldn't have been too difficult to properly vet a place that deals with such a sensitive matter.

1026
01:16:00,860 --> 01:16:05,860
However, as we'll see with our second example, that doesn't seem to be the Dr. Phil show's forte.

1027
01:16:26,860 --> 01:16:52,860
In 2010, Dr. Phil came face to face with two challenging adolescent sisters,

1028
01:16:52,860 --> 01:16:56,860
who he and many others felt were taking advantage of their parents and staged an intervention,

1029
01:16:56,860 --> 01:16:59,860
sending them to a resort that we'll talk about in a little bit.

1030
01:17:13,860 --> 01:17:15,860
Despite the apparently successful treatment of the younger sister,

1031
01:17:15,860 --> 01:17:18,860
the older sister was still acting out, much to the parent's dismay.

1032
01:17:19,860 --> 01:17:21,860
However, against Dr. Phil's advice and the mother's opinion,

1033
01:17:21,860 --> 01:17:25,860
the father did not want to send his daughter to an Aspen Group boarding school,

1034
01:17:25,860 --> 01:17:27,860
as he felt it was not in their best interests,

1035
01:17:27,860 --> 01:17:32,860
which led once again to Dr. Phil inviting them back on for further discussion on the matter.

1036
01:17:48,860 --> 01:18:03,860
This episode billed them as the most frustrating parents,

1037
01:18:03,860 --> 01:18:05,860
and Dr. Phil's attitude seemed to reflect that,

1038
01:18:05,860 --> 01:18:07,860
opening up the episode by quoting enraged viewers,

1039
01:18:07,860 --> 01:18:11,860
and then proceeding to sit down with them and taking them to a task on their failings,

1040
01:18:11,860 --> 01:18:16,860
while spectators froth at their mouths a stark reminder of what happens when you do not listen to the esteemed Dr. Phil.

1041
01:18:18,860 --> 01:18:22,860
I'm really disappointed that your show is only interested in supporting Aspen programs,

1042
01:18:22,860 --> 01:18:26,860
and not other highly qualified programs that could benefit my daughters.

1043
01:18:26,860 --> 01:18:33,860
Obviously, what's beneficial for my daughters is secondary to what is good for the show and for Aspen.

1044
01:18:33,860 --> 01:18:36,860
I understand that first and foremost, you have a business to run.

1045
01:18:38,860 --> 01:18:40,860
Are you serious?

1046
01:18:41,860 --> 01:18:43,860
Are you serious when you write this?

1047
01:18:43,860 --> 01:18:45,860
This is offensive to me.

1048
01:18:45,860 --> 01:18:51,860
I just have to tell you, when I read this, my initial reaction was, I'm done.

1049
01:18:51,860 --> 01:18:57,860
We have an advisory board, it's like 20 people, the top minds in psychology, sociology, medicine.

1050
01:18:57,860 --> 01:19:01,860
When we get a story, it goes out to our advisory board, and we ask them for input.

1051
01:19:01,860 --> 01:19:07,860
One of the top therapeutic residential programs on the globe is the Aspen Group.

1052
01:19:07,860 --> 01:19:12,860
So we reach out to them and say, hey guys, will you help us here?

1053
01:19:12,860 --> 01:19:19,860
We work with dozens of people all over the country, but the collective wisdom is that that's who we're going to contact here.

1054
01:19:19,860 --> 01:19:22,860
Other than an outwardly admitting that he has a business arrangement,

1055
01:19:22,860 --> 01:19:25,860
and accusing the father of requesting financial support for his own preferences,

1056
01:19:25,860 --> 01:19:30,860
despite the fact that he never seemingly wrote that, McGraw doesn't really provide much of a real response to the father

1057
01:19:30,860 --> 01:19:34,860
as to why it's in this girl's best interest to attend a boarding school,

1058
01:19:34,860 --> 01:19:38,860
other than broad philosophical narratives, and expressing how insulted he felt,

1059
01:19:38,860 --> 01:19:43,860
how he consults all the experts, etc. etc. etc. Dr. Phil is the fucking best, whatever.

1060
01:19:43,860 --> 01:19:48,860
The Aspen Group is one of the top residential therapeutic programs on the globe.

1061
01:19:48,860 --> 01:19:51,860
How could you not send your child there?

1062
01:19:51,860 --> 01:19:57,860
Is your teen out of control? The Aspen Education Group can help you get that teen back on track.

1063
01:19:57,860 --> 01:20:04,860
Aspen's nationwide network of programs has been featured on my show for years, and they can help your family too.

1064
01:20:04,860 --> 01:20:11,860
You can call an Aspen consultant today to learn more about their outstanding residential and outdoor programs.

1065
01:20:11,860 --> 01:20:16,860
Well, a large majority of the Aspen Group's projects have been closed down or sold in the last decade.

1066
01:20:16,860 --> 01:20:19,860
In fact, there is not a single boarding school still being operated by them,

1067
01:20:19,860 --> 01:20:24,860
with a fair few scandals that were well known by the time that Dr. Phil went on his verbal crusade against the father,

1068
01:20:24,860 --> 01:20:28,860
including one to a boarding school that resulted in an investigation that concluded that

1069
01:20:28,860 --> 01:20:33,860
the agency had reasonable cause to believe that abuse or neglect occurred at the school, six months before this episode.

1070
01:20:33,860 --> 01:20:36,860
Another place formerly known as Island View has had so many controversies,

1071
01:20:36,860 --> 01:20:39,860
it would be funny if the stories weren't deeply depressing,

1072
01:20:39,860 --> 01:20:43,860
including one in which a girl was fully isolated for 58 days after running away,

1073
01:20:43,860 --> 01:20:49,860
an isolation in which she had to rely on staff attention to even interact with anyone, which did have its occasional failings.

1074
01:20:49,860 --> 01:20:55,860
Dr. Phil was even sooner relating to one of these stories a few years later, but came out on top that time.

1075
01:20:55,860 --> 01:20:59,860
I believe in these folks right here. I believe they have traction.

1076
01:20:59,860 --> 01:21:05,860
If you want to get Alexis there, and Aspen is still willing after all of this,

1077
01:21:05,860 --> 01:21:15,860
and what I consider to be disrespect from you about their motives, then I will make that available to you.

1078
01:21:15,860 --> 01:21:20,860
I don't know, I feel maybe this whole Aspen Group gig isn't everything it's cracked up to be,

1079
01:21:20,860 --> 01:21:24,860
and actually whether by intent or not, the father was in the right.

1080
01:21:25,860 --> 01:21:30,860
But the Dr. Phil's reputation preceded it, Dr. Phil knows what's best for your children,

1081
01:21:30,860 --> 01:21:33,860
he has files on top of files, and if you're to suggest otherwise,

1082
01:21:33,860 --> 01:21:39,860
you're giving in to your offspring's manipulative ploys that have driven a wedge between you and the rest of the family.

1083
01:21:39,860 --> 01:21:42,860
It's a shtick, and it's one that wasn't always completely applicable,

1084
01:21:42,860 --> 01:21:46,860
particularly when the real-world evidence didn't exactly support what was being promoted,

1085
01:21:46,860 --> 01:21:50,860
and when you're dealing with young people that's not something that can be remedied,

1086
01:21:50,860 --> 01:21:56,860
in so many places of debatable standing, it was only a matter of time until one came to the forefront of public discussion.

1087
01:22:14,860 --> 01:22:17,860
Many of you probably don't remember this, or even know about it,

1088
01:22:17,860 --> 01:22:21,860
in the 21st century there was this series that had some international presence known as Brat Camp.

1089
01:22:21,860 --> 01:22:24,860
It was most popular in the UK where it ran for five seasons,

1090
01:22:24,860 --> 01:22:28,860
but did have some counterparts in continental Europe and even a US series.

1091
01:22:28,860 --> 01:22:34,860
As you can maybe guess, the premise was built around adolescence with behavioural and substance issues going to a camp,

1092
01:22:34,860 --> 01:22:40,860
and having those issues addressed, however this wasn't any standard therapy centre, this was more a wilderness camp.

1093
01:22:40,860 --> 01:22:43,860
They teach the kids the ways of the wild west,

1094
01:22:43,860 --> 01:22:51,860
and believe a strict regime of chores, tough rules and harsh punishment can turn bad kids into good kids.

1095
01:22:51,860 --> 01:22:55,860
I have all the compassion in the world for these people, for these kids,

1096
01:22:55,860 --> 01:23:00,860
but I just lack a little sympathy because of the way their behaviour is, and that's what we need to work on.

1097
01:23:00,860 --> 01:23:05,860
In the UK the first season was such a resounding success that they decided to invest in a second series,

1098
01:23:05,860 --> 01:23:11,860
however the producers of this show decided to raise the stakes by casting more challenging teens with intensified drama.

1099
01:23:11,860 --> 01:23:16,860
Upon hearing this, the ranch that was featured in the first series, Red Cliff Ascent, refused to host another series,

1100
01:23:16,860 --> 01:23:21,860
stating that they were a treatment program, not a TV show. Completely fair.

1101
01:23:21,860 --> 01:23:26,860
So the team behind Brat Camp set their sights on another location, this being Escalante, Utah,

1102
01:23:26,860 --> 01:23:29,860
the home of a humble spot known as Turnabout Ranch.

1103
01:23:29,860 --> 01:23:35,860
Turnabout Ranch is one of the many haciendas that have taken on the role of doubling up as a centre for wilderness therapy.

1104
01:23:35,860 --> 01:23:40,860
This sort of therapy is different to the traditional idea of such, it promotes living with the land,

1105
01:23:40,860 --> 01:23:44,860
devoid of the privileges or luxuries that modern life has typically afforded us.

1106
01:23:44,860 --> 01:23:50,860
However, Turnabout Ranch was certainly on the more austere side of these projects, it wasn't Malibu to say the least.

1107
01:23:51,860 --> 01:23:55,860
Everybody get up now. Slumber party's over, get up.

1108
01:23:58,860 --> 01:24:02,860
Quit talking, everybody down here now. Out of bed, let's go.

1109
01:24:06,860 --> 01:24:09,860
Foul language is not appropriate. Foul language is not appropriate.

1110
01:24:10,860 --> 01:24:16,860
No talking. You're going to spend three days out there. It's going to be three of the worst days you've spent a long time in your life.

1111
01:24:16,860 --> 01:24:19,860
You're going to hate every second of it. There's going to be a lot of tears, a lot of emotions.

1112
01:24:21,860 --> 01:24:25,860
So if you want to make it five days, it's your choice. But I'm not going to put up with it.

1113
01:24:25,860 --> 01:24:32,860
In most American camps, the impact stage is used to physically exhaust rebellious kids into being more compliant.

1114
01:24:33,860 --> 01:24:36,860
But at Turnabout, they have a unique strategy.

1115
01:24:37,860 --> 01:24:43,860
For three whole days, the kids are made to stay in a small stone circle in total silence.

1116
01:24:43,860 --> 01:24:47,860
In hindsight, it's hard not to understand why these sorts of shows aren't being aired today.

1117
01:24:47,860 --> 01:24:52,860
They're a pretty cruel form of therapy, and although some people did manage to turn their lives around,

1118
01:24:52,860 --> 01:24:56,860
others didn't, and one former contestant of another series even died in 2009.

1119
01:24:56,860 --> 01:25:01,860
How these sorts of residences continued long after the end of the TV shows that documented their methods.

1120
01:25:01,860 --> 01:25:07,860
In fact, Turnabout in particular went on to be one of the most popular resorts for teens featured on a popular daytime show.

1121
01:25:07,860 --> 01:25:09,860
I wonder what that show could be.

1122
01:25:10,860 --> 01:25:15,860
From the Aspen Education Group, she's one of many groups that we work with.

1123
01:25:15,860 --> 01:25:17,860
She works with Turnabout Ranch.

1124
01:25:17,860 --> 01:25:22,860
Dr Phil has always made a point of not approaching people from the same perspective that many TV shows hosted.

1125
01:25:22,860 --> 01:25:28,860
His conversations with troubled people were always staged more like an intervention rather than an interrogation,

1126
01:25:28,860 --> 01:25:30,860
though sometimes the former did seep into the latter.

1127
01:25:30,860 --> 01:25:34,860
With this in mind, although Dr Phil did want people to take responsibility for their actions,

1128
01:25:34,860 --> 01:25:38,860
it wasn't like they weren't deserving of humane treatment and sympathy.

1129
01:25:38,860 --> 01:25:41,860
However, those who were most troubled, he sent them to Turnabout Ranch.

1130
01:25:41,860 --> 01:25:45,860
That in many ways seemed very much against what he regularly preached on the show.

1131
01:25:45,860 --> 01:25:50,860
Turnabout Ranch wasn't a particularly friendly place, it was the sort of place where if you struggled more,

1132
01:25:50,860 --> 01:25:55,860
you'd receive more severe treatment, as documented in Brat Camp and in Testimonies by Others.

1133
01:25:55,860 --> 01:26:03,860
Yet in 2010, Turnabout Ranch made its debut on the Dr Phil show with an inspirational segment featuring former guests and a softly spoken rancher.

1134
01:26:09,860 --> 01:26:12,860
Being here helped me find happiness.

1135
01:26:12,860 --> 01:26:15,860
When Elena first arrived here, she was very resistant.

1136
01:26:15,860 --> 01:26:19,860
I was furious. Like, I hate everyone.

1137
01:26:19,860 --> 01:26:22,860
She really turned and made some major progress.

1138
01:26:22,860 --> 01:26:28,860
After a couple of days, I was like, wow, it is my fault. I got myself in this situation.

1139
01:26:28,860 --> 01:26:33,860
She really shines as one of our leaders and she takes a lot of pride in what she does.

1140
01:26:33,860 --> 01:26:37,860
Ironically enough, this debut clip featured the girls who I mentioned earlier.

1141
01:26:37,860 --> 01:26:42,860
Most notably Elena, the younger sister who seemed much more receptive to the Ranch's treatment.

1142
01:26:42,860 --> 01:26:47,860
The Ranch was presented as a hands-on getaway where youngsters could build a closer relationship to the wildlife

1143
01:26:47,860 --> 01:26:50,860
and garner a greater appreciation for those around them.

1144
01:26:50,860 --> 01:26:55,860
It seemed pretty positive, however, as Elena's older sister showed, it wasn't a formula that worked for everyone.

1145
01:26:55,860 --> 01:27:00,860
In spite of this though, McGraw and Co proceeded with a pretty close partnership over the following years,

1146
01:27:00,860 --> 01:27:06,860
sending many troubled teens here, leading up to arguably our most high-profile case, Danielle Bregoli.

1147
01:27:07,860 --> 01:27:29,860
Danielle Bregoli was always a bit of an exceptional individual,

1148
01:27:29,860 --> 01:27:34,860
and after her appearances on the Dr. Phil show, McGraw felt there was no other option than to send her to the Turnabout Ranch.

1149
01:27:34,860 --> 01:27:39,860
After all, it was always his answer to those he viewed as the entitled generation.

1150
01:27:39,860 --> 01:27:44,860
Bregoli was a person who continuously undermined Phil and all those who tried to help her,

1151
01:27:44,860 --> 01:27:48,860
and as a last resort, perhaps a more challenging environment would aid her outlook.

1152
01:27:48,860 --> 01:27:52,860
So at the end of 2016, she spent four and a half months in Turnabout Ranch,

1153
01:27:52,860 --> 01:27:56,860
and whatever she experienced there ultimately didn't have any lasting impact,

1154
01:27:56,860 --> 01:28:01,860
as not too long after, she appeared back on the Dr. Phil show ever defined in her nature.

1155
01:28:02,860 --> 01:28:07,860
When you were at Turnabout, you said that you had learned that material things didn't mean as much anymore.

1156
01:28:07,860 --> 01:28:10,860
That was just a show, damn.

1157
01:28:10,860 --> 01:28:12,860
That was just so I could get out of there.

1158
01:28:12,860 --> 01:28:13,860
Let me put it this way.

1159
01:28:13,860 --> 01:28:17,860
Y'all could put me in a program for six years and I'm going to come out the same person I came in.

1160
01:28:17,860 --> 01:28:21,860
How is it being back home?

1161
01:28:21,860 --> 01:28:23,860
I don't know, it's just home.

1162
01:28:23,860 --> 01:28:24,860
What do you want to tell Dr. Phil?

1163
01:28:24,860 --> 01:28:26,860
What I told him last time.

1164
01:28:26,860 --> 01:28:27,860
Thumbs up my d***.

1165
01:28:27,860 --> 01:28:30,860
What do you want to see happen on the show this time?

1166
01:28:30,860 --> 01:28:33,860
This time I won't be throwing water at nobody ever throwing hands at somebody.

1167
01:28:33,860 --> 01:28:37,860
By then, it should have been clear that the Turnabout Ranch didn't really function for everyone,

1168
01:28:37,860 --> 01:28:41,860
but upon her return, it was framed like the failure of such therapy was Bregoli's own fault,

1169
01:28:41,860 --> 01:28:48,860
when in reality, it was clear that the Dr. Phil format wasn't ever effective for someone so aware of their own media presence like Bregoli.

1170
01:28:48,860 --> 01:28:50,860
She knew what the point of Turnabout Ranch would be,

1171
01:28:50,860 --> 01:28:55,860
why would she conform to those expectations when her whole existence is based on rebellion?

1172
01:28:55,860 --> 01:28:58,860
Not many people stop to think that maybe Bregoli wasn't to blame.

1173
01:28:59,860 --> 01:29:02,860
Phil would probably suggest that the fact that she seemed to behave better at Turnout Ranch

1174
01:29:02,860 --> 01:29:05,860
meant that it must be the fault of the home environment,

1175
01:29:05,860 --> 01:29:08,860
but if it genuinely worked in transforming Bregoli's mindset,

1176
01:29:08,860 --> 01:29:10,860
a changing environment wouldn't affect that.

1177
01:29:10,860 --> 01:29:13,860
She's just gotten onto the fact that if she didn't cause as much disruption,

1178
01:29:13,860 --> 01:29:15,860
they'd likely be friendlier towards her.

1179
01:29:15,860 --> 01:29:17,860
However, that's not a philosophy adopted by everyone.

1180
01:29:17,860 --> 01:29:21,860
You see, in the time between 2010 and 2017,

1181
01:29:21,860 --> 01:29:23,860
Turnabout Ranch had been involved in numerous controversies,

1182
01:29:23,860 --> 01:29:25,860
including a lawsuit which alleged torture,

1183
01:29:25,860 --> 01:29:28,860
another patient that claimed to have covered up a sexual assault case,

1184
01:29:28,860 --> 01:29:30,860
and probably the most significant situation,

1185
01:29:30,860 --> 01:29:34,860
an actual homicide that occurred during Danielle Bregoli's time at Turnabout Ranch.

1186
01:29:34,860 --> 01:29:38,860
Clay Brewer, a disturbed teen who had been sent there to receive treatment,

1187
01:29:38,860 --> 01:29:42,860
attacked a staffer with a blunt object who subsequently succumbed to their injuries.

1188
01:29:42,860 --> 01:29:45,860
This was during the controversial circle therapy shown earlier,

1189
01:29:45,860 --> 01:29:49,860
which isolates individuals and is supposed to give them time to think about their lives.

1190
01:29:49,860 --> 01:29:53,860
But in the wrong environment, it's completely valid to see how this would also be detrimental to an individual.

1191
01:29:53,860 --> 01:29:55,860
Now, it should be clear that when something awful happens,

1192
01:29:55,860 --> 01:29:59,860
there has to be a level of responsibility accepted by the individual,

1193
01:29:59,860 --> 01:30:00,860
even if they're a minor,

1194
01:30:00,860 --> 01:30:02,860
but there also has to be some question about how,

1195
01:30:02,860 --> 01:30:03,860
with all this considered,

1196
01:30:03,860 --> 01:30:06,860
Bregoli was meant to come back the happy-go-lucky teen next time.

1197
01:30:06,860 --> 01:30:08,860
If this was just going to be swept under the rug

1198
01:30:08,860 --> 01:30:12,860
and people were going to act like patients should just take it in their stride,

1199
01:30:12,860 --> 01:30:14,860
then they probably had another thing coming.

1200
01:30:14,860 --> 01:30:16,860
And eventually, they did.

1201
01:30:23,860 --> 01:30:32,860
The 21st century definitely prompted us to take a different perspective on talk shows in general,

1202
01:30:32,860 --> 01:30:34,860
and the tabloid genre was no exception,

1203
01:30:34,860 --> 01:30:39,860
especially given that it often generated the most controversy out of any form of that entertainment.

1204
01:30:39,860 --> 01:30:41,860
I've heard some crazy stories over the years,

1205
01:30:41,860 --> 01:30:47,860
but one topic that keeps me scratching my head is when women fake being pregnant.

1206
01:30:47,860 --> 01:30:54,860
Okay, so this is Shane, and he says gay people are disgusting and weak.

1207
01:30:54,860 --> 01:30:56,860
Right here, we've got Greg.

1208
01:30:56,860 --> 01:31:00,860
Greg says that he is terrified of gay people.

1209
01:31:00,860 --> 01:31:01,860
Even in the early days of the genre,

1210
01:31:01,860 --> 01:31:05,860
incidents had occurred that raised questions about the ethics of this content,

1211
01:31:05,860 --> 01:31:09,860
most notably in 1995, when on an episode of the Jenny Jones shows,

1212
01:31:09,860 --> 01:31:13,860
Scott Amadur, a gay man, had expressed love for their male friend Jonathan Schmitz.

1213
01:31:13,860 --> 01:31:16,860
While this confession was seemingly brushed off at first by the male friend,

1214
01:31:16,860 --> 01:31:19,860
three days later, Amadur died at the hands of him.

1215
01:31:19,860 --> 01:31:23,860
Lawsuits and interviews subsequently revealed that the producers of the show had misled Schmitz

1216
01:31:23,860 --> 01:31:25,860
into thinking that his admirer was a woman,

1217
01:31:25,860 --> 01:31:30,860
while being aware of his history of mental disturbance and alcohol slash substance abuse.

1218
01:31:30,860 --> 01:31:32,860
Although not solely responsible for Amadur's death,

1219
01:31:32,860 --> 01:31:35,860
there was little doubt that the actions of the show provoked a tragedy

1220
01:31:35,860 --> 01:31:40,860
while disregarding a culture that was still very hostile towards people of differing sexual preferences.

1221
01:31:40,860 --> 01:31:42,860
It was clear that when dealing with such sensitive topics,

1222
01:31:42,860 --> 01:31:45,860
there was a lack of diplomacy in the pursuit for ratings,

1223
01:31:45,860 --> 01:31:47,860
and this could easily have negative consequences.

1224
01:31:47,860 --> 01:31:49,860
Nonetheless, this also worked to the genre's advantage,

1225
01:31:49,860 --> 01:31:52,860
as it purported to show the uglier side of humanity.

1226
01:31:52,860 --> 01:31:55,860
Therefore, certain incidents were going to be inevitable.

1227
01:31:55,860 --> 01:31:58,860
Whether it was even fair to show these in the first place is a question that I'll get to later,

1228
01:31:58,860 --> 01:32:00,860
but in cases such as Jeremy Kyle,

1229
01:32:00,860 --> 01:32:04,860
it was clear that mistreatment of people was so commonplace because it was expected,

1230
01:32:04,860 --> 01:32:06,860
and in both cases of Jones and Kyle,

1231
01:32:06,860 --> 01:32:09,860
these shows were only ever fully reprimanded when someone actually died.

1232
01:32:09,860 --> 01:32:13,860
Hell, the Jenny Jones show continued for an additional eight years

1233
01:32:13,860 --> 01:32:15,860
after the death of the aforementioned guest.

1234
01:32:15,860 --> 01:32:17,860
Doctor Phil was different, though.

1235
01:32:17,860 --> 01:32:22,860
You've got to miss siblings, you've got to miss those that...

1236
01:32:22,860 --> 01:32:24,860
I think about it every day.

1237
01:32:24,860 --> 01:32:29,860
Like, I just, I miss my twin sister, I miss my brother.

1238
01:32:29,860 --> 01:32:31,860
I miss all of them, really.

1239
01:32:31,860 --> 01:32:33,860
You don't have to miss Abba because she's here.

1240
01:32:33,860 --> 01:32:34,860
Abba, come on out.

1241
01:32:34,860 --> 01:32:46,860
Although he wasn't afraid to tackle the tough subjects,

1242
01:32:46,860 --> 01:32:49,860
he still did it with the narrative of helping and supporting these people,

1243
01:32:49,860 --> 01:32:51,860
who he knew, as a professional,

1244
01:32:51,860 --> 01:32:53,860
were still encountering some form of struggle,

1245
01:32:53,860 --> 01:32:55,860
regardless of what they may have done.

1246
01:32:55,860 --> 01:32:57,860
Therefore, in spite of the space that he operated in,

1247
01:32:57,860 --> 01:33:00,860
Doctor Phil still had a reputation to uphold,

1248
01:33:00,860 --> 01:33:02,860
and as someone who had been under fire for the past few years,

1249
01:33:02,860 --> 01:33:06,860
and embroiled in lawsuits, this was certainly going to be a challenge.

1250
01:33:06,860 --> 01:33:10,860
The era that we live in is also quite different to that of 1995.

1251
01:33:10,860 --> 01:33:13,860
The online world definitely enabled an interconnectivity

1252
01:33:13,860 --> 01:33:16,860
that allowed people to spread their messages more effectively,

1253
01:33:16,860 --> 01:33:18,860
and by establishing himself as an online presence,

1254
01:33:18,860 --> 01:33:21,860
thanks to the help of platforms like YouTube and those who existed there,

1255
01:33:21,860 --> 01:33:24,860
he also opened himself up to criticism from the platform,

1256
01:33:24,860 --> 01:33:26,860
and by 2021, it had long been brewing.

1257
01:33:26,860 --> 01:33:29,860
The thing about YouTube is that it's a two-way street.

1258
01:33:29,860 --> 01:33:33,860
If you have a public spat or altercation where you platform that person,

1259
01:33:33,860 --> 01:33:37,860
there are very few plugs that can be pulled on another person's ability to broadcast publicly,

1260
01:33:37,860 --> 01:33:41,860
and you can very easily provide them a platform through your own actions.

1261
01:33:41,860 --> 01:33:43,860
This was exactly the case with Danielle Bregoli,

1262
01:33:43,860 --> 01:33:46,860
who by 2021 went by the name of Bad Baby,

1263
01:33:46,860 --> 01:33:48,860
and was well known outside of YouTube.

1264
01:33:48,860 --> 01:33:51,860
However, in April, she returned to the platform that immortalized her,

1265
01:33:51,860 --> 01:33:55,860
with the intent on presenting our esteemed TV host with an ultimatum.

1266
01:33:56,860 --> 01:34:01,860
So, Dr. Phil, I'm going to give you from now till April 5th to issue an apology,

1267
01:34:01,860 --> 01:34:06,860
not only to me, but to Hannah and any other child that you sent to Turnabout

1268
01:34:06,860 --> 01:34:10,860
or any other program like this, and if you don't, I'm going to handle things my way.

1269
01:34:10,860 --> 01:34:13,860
Somewhere in the middle of August, I went on the Dr. Phil show,

1270
01:34:13,860 --> 01:34:16,860
and my mom and my grandma knew they were sending me here.

1271
01:34:16,860 --> 01:34:17,860
I didn't know I was going.

1272
01:34:17,860 --> 01:34:19,860
I went school shopping right before because the school was supposed to start

1273
01:34:19,860 --> 01:34:22,860
when I got home from L.A. from doing the show.

1274
01:34:22,860 --> 01:34:26,860
So, part of the whole Dr. Phil show is they send these kids to either Turnabout

1275
01:34:26,860 --> 01:34:28,860
or these other programs that are also in Utah,

1276
01:34:28,860 --> 01:34:31,860
but they're all wilderness programs, and they're all fucked up.

1277
01:34:31,860 --> 01:34:34,860
This video not only called out the modus operandi of the show,

1278
01:34:34,860 --> 01:34:36,860
but also the treatment at Turnabout Branch,

1279
01:34:36,860 --> 01:34:39,860
and the supposed therapy that they received there.

1280
01:34:39,860 --> 01:34:41,860
So, for the first three days, there is no showering.

1281
01:34:41,860 --> 01:34:44,860
They put you in a circle, which is a TP.

1282
01:34:44,860 --> 01:34:47,860
It's a little TP, but it's open, and you have to sit there for three days.

1283
01:34:47,860 --> 01:34:49,860
They wouldn't let me lay down for nothing.

1284
01:34:49,860 --> 01:34:52,860
I was falling asleep, and they were like, uh-uh, get up, get up.

1285
01:34:52,860 --> 01:34:55,860
So, I'm just sitting here like, this is going to be really bad.

1286
01:34:55,860 --> 01:34:59,860
When I see these people have no sympathy, I was like, oh, I'm really doomed.

1287
01:34:59,860 --> 01:35:04,860
They take away necessity privileges, like sleeping on a bed, eating good food,

1288
01:35:04,860 --> 01:35:06,860
not being cold, witnessing it.

1289
01:35:06,860 --> 01:35:11,860
If you reported another kid getting bullied by their peers or something,

1290
01:35:11,860 --> 01:35:15,860
they would just say, well, maybe that's what they need, or something like that.

1291
01:35:15,860 --> 01:35:19,860
Even though there was written rules, if a staff was angry at the moment,

1292
01:35:19,860 --> 01:35:21,860
or if you just did something that they felt was bad,

1293
01:35:21,860 --> 01:35:23,860
you would get your own punishment.

1294
01:35:23,860 --> 01:35:24,860
They would make up their own punishment for you.

1295
01:35:24,860 --> 01:35:27,860
It's really frustrating, because even if you don't know the rules,

1296
01:35:27,860 --> 01:35:29,860
if you fuck up, you're still in trouble.

1297
01:35:29,860 --> 01:35:31,860
There's not no, I didn't know.

1298
01:35:31,860 --> 01:35:33,860
You're still in deep shit.

1299
01:35:33,860 --> 01:35:37,860
They had no problem holding kids down, which is against the law.

1300
01:35:37,860 --> 01:35:40,860
You're not supposed to touch the kids, but they had no problem doing that.

1301
01:35:40,860 --> 01:35:43,860
It's just our word against the staff's word when you're there,

1302
01:35:43,860 --> 01:35:46,860
because there's no witnesses, there's no cameras, you don't have a phone.

1303
01:35:46,860 --> 01:35:47,860
There's none of that.

1304
01:35:47,860 --> 01:35:50,860
That's why I was always so scared to speak out, because no one's going to believe me.

1305
01:35:50,860 --> 01:35:53,860
Now this is of course a personal testimony.

1306
01:35:53,860 --> 01:35:56,860
However, looking at the episodes of Brat Camp that I had archived,

1307
01:35:56,860 --> 01:35:57,860
this all seemed very feasible.

1308
01:35:57,860 --> 01:36:00,860
For some, of course, this would seem like appropriate disciplinary measures

1309
01:36:00,860 --> 01:36:02,860
against an ill-mannered teen.

1310
01:36:02,860 --> 01:36:05,860
However, this was also never really explained on Dr. Phil,

1311
01:36:05,860 --> 01:36:08,860
and as a matter of fact, whenever discussing Turnabout Ranch,

1312
01:36:08,860 --> 01:36:12,860
footage would always be shown of an activity more wholesome, such as horse riding.

1313
01:36:13,860 --> 01:36:15,860
I doubt that was unintentional.

1314
01:36:15,860 --> 01:36:17,860
One morning I was cleaning up for breakfast,

1315
01:36:17,860 --> 01:36:19,860
and one of the staff members was standing right next to me,

1316
01:36:19,860 --> 01:36:21,860
and she had her walkie on her, so I heard everything.

1317
01:36:21,860 --> 01:36:23,860
One of the kids, he had tried to steal a car or something,

1318
01:36:23,860 --> 01:36:26,860
everyone was screaming on the walkies like it was really crazy,

1319
01:36:26,860 --> 01:36:28,860
and he ended up killing one of the staff members.

1320
01:36:28,860 --> 01:36:30,860
They made all the kids that were at Roundy come down,

1321
01:36:30,860 --> 01:36:32,860
and then they told us not to tell us anything.

1322
01:36:32,860 --> 01:36:36,860
A day later, every kid that's at Turnabout, they have us all in a circle,

1323
01:36:36,860 --> 01:36:39,860
and they're like, listen, it was an incident, I know some of y'all heard it over the walkies,

1324
01:36:39,860 --> 01:36:40,860
Jimmy died.

1325
01:36:41,860 --> 01:36:43,860
And so we're all freaking out, because Jimmy was, like I said,

1326
01:36:43,860 --> 01:36:46,860
he was one of them that was there the first day I got there, he was really sweet.

1327
01:36:46,860 --> 01:36:50,860
Not only did Jimmy die, but one of the other staff members that was there at the time,

1328
01:36:50,860 --> 01:36:53,860
Alicia, who was the daughter of the nurse,

1329
01:36:53,860 --> 01:36:58,860
Alicia, she was injured, and two years later she died,

1330
01:36:58,860 --> 01:37:02,860
and she was also left disabled after being attacked by Clay.

1331
01:37:02,860 --> 01:37:05,860
Bregoli's recounting of the Turnabout Ranch goes over many unnerving details,

1332
01:37:05,860 --> 01:37:07,860
including that relating to the death of the staff,

1333
01:37:08,860 --> 01:37:11,860
and how that would understandably affect a young person residing there,

1334
01:37:11,860 --> 01:37:13,860
however there are more details she wanted to reveal.

1335
01:37:14,860 --> 01:37:19,860
A young lady, her name is Hannah, she recently spoke out,

1336
01:37:19,860 --> 01:37:22,860
because while she was there, she was sexually assaulted,

1337
01:37:22,860 --> 01:37:26,860
and then when she reported that she was assaulted, she was punished by staff.

1338
01:37:26,860 --> 01:37:31,860
Now, when I seen the punishment she was given, I knew like,

1339
01:37:31,860 --> 01:37:34,860
okay, I really have to say something, I really have to have her back on this,

1340
01:37:34,860 --> 01:37:36,860
because I truly believe that they did that.

1341
01:37:36,860 --> 01:37:40,860
This claim covered the alleged violation of someone who was staying at the ranch at the same time,

1342
01:37:40,860 --> 01:37:43,860
and how she was treated by personnel when she complained about it.

1343
01:37:43,860 --> 01:37:46,860
It was clearly a matter that Bregoli took very seriously,

1344
01:37:46,860 --> 01:37:49,860
and with this information it was easy to understand why she expected, at the least,

1345
01:37:49,860 --> 01:37:51,860
an apology from the man himself.

1346
01:37:51,860 --> 01:37:54,860
Would they receive it? Well, not really.

1347
01:37:54,860 --> 01:37:57,860
Around a week after the publication of the video,

1348
01:37:57,860 --> 01:38:00,860
Dr. Phil made an appearance on the Ashley Banfield show NewsNation

1349
01:38:00,860 --> 01:38:02,860
to discuss this matter further.

1350
01:38:02,860 --> 01:38:04,860
This was a pretty significant moment in the show's history,

1351
01:38:04,860 --> 01:38:07,860
as Dr. Phil had very rarely taken to interviews to address situations

1352
01:38:07,860 --> 01:38:10,860
which may question his character, outside the show at least.

1353
01:38:10,860 --> 01:38:13,860
However, after a few minutes you begin to see why.

1354
01:38:13,860 --> 01:38:18,860
Well, you know, she went to turnabout four or five years ago,

1355
01:38:18,860 --> 01:38:21,860
and she had a bad experience.

1356
01:38:21,860 --> 01:38:24,860
Obviously, I would hate that, we'd be sorry about that,

1357
01:38:24,860 --> 01:38:31,860
but we don't have anything to do with what happens with guests once they leave the stage.

1358
01:38:31,860 --> 01:38:37,860
I mean, that's between the guardian and the parent, and whatever facility they go to.

1359
01:38:37,860 --> 01:38:40,860
So he does say that he would be sorry if she'd had a bad experience.

1360
01:38:40,860 --> 01:38:44,860
I suppose that is a half-apology, but I don't think there's that much question

1361
01:38:44,860 --> 01:38:46,860
that she had a bad experience by the sound of it,

1362
01:38:46,860 --> 01:38:49,860
regardless of whether what she's saying is 100% honest.

1363
01:38:49,860 --> 01:38:53,860
I don't think we need any ifs at this point, if that's the threshold for an apology.

1364
01:38:53,860 --> 01:38:58,860
What else is there but some tough love, you know, at a ranch or where else?

1365
01:38:58,860 --> 01:39:01,860
You can't coddle kids like that.

1366
01:39:01,860 --> 01:39:05,860
He also seems to distance himself from his own personal involvement in Turnabout Ranch.

1367
01:39:05,860 --> 01:39:09,860
And okay, although I would say it's difficult to hold Dr. Phil personally responsible

1368
01:39:09,860 --> 01:39:13,860
for the actions of another individual, this still isn't an honest reply.

1369
01:39:13,860 --> 01:39:17,860
To be frank, the idea that they have absolutely no involvement is just preposterous.

1370
01:39:17,860 --> 01:39:21,860
The countless promotional videos, the unrivalled, unquestioning praise,

1371
01:39:21,860 --> 01:39:24,860
they all say far much more than McGraw can say in a single interview.

1372
01:39:24,860 --> 01:39:28,860
Dr. Phil was extremely enthusiastic about the organisations he worked with,

1373
01:39:28,860 --> 01:39:31,860
even to the point of roasting parents who didn't agree.

1374
01:39:31,860 --> 01:39:33,860
He could have acted shocked when confronted with this information,

1375
01:39:33,860 --> 01:39:35,860
and it would have been more convincing than him saying

1376
01:39:35,860 --> 01:39:39,860
they don't have anything to do with these places once they're out of Dr. Phil's care.

1377
01:39:39,860 --> 01:39:45,860
So we're not involved in that, we don't have any feedback from them,

1378
01:39:45,860 --> 01:39:52,860
so whatever happens once they're there, that's between them and the facility.

1379
01:39:52,860 --> 01:39:56,860
I assume she had a problem, she filed a complaint with the proper authorities

1380
01:39:56,860 --> 01:40:00,860
or something five years ago, so I really don't know much about it.

1381
01:40:00,860 --> 01:40:07,860
And we asked them for input on one of the top therapeutic residential programs on the globe.

1382
01:40:07,860 --> 01:40:09,860
Yeah, right.

1383
01:40:09,860 --> 01:40:13,860
Tonight on an all-new episode, the dangers of Dr. Phil.

1384
01:40:13,860 --> 01:40:28,860
A few months after the video and the subsequent Dr. Phil interview,

1385
01:40:28,860 --> 01:40:31,860
it was announced that the victim of the violation that Bregoli had spoken about,

1386
01:40:31,860 --> 01:40:35,860
Hannah Archuleta, was initiating a lawsuit against Dr. Phil and their collaborating studios

1387
01:40:35,860 --> 01:40:38,860
for the participation in sending children to Turnabout Ranch,

1388
01:40:38,860 --> 01:40:43,860
or supposedly being aware of the many controversies that the centre had been involved in since the early 2010s.

1389
01:40:43,860 --> 01:40:48,860
We'll address the result of that in a bit, but it definitely posed the question of how ignorant Dr. Phil could be

1390
01:40:48,860 --> 01:40:51,860
to the many problems that seemed evident to any onlooker,

1391
01:40:51,860 --> 01:40:56,860
and these qualms would only be heightened as the industry looked more inward to address problems of workplace culture.

1392
01:40:56,860 --> 01:41:01,860
2020 was an interesting year for many reasons, however, as many viewers of this channel may recall,

1393
01:41:01,860 --> 01:41:05,860
it was the year where the conduct of certain talk show hosts was brought into question,

1394
01:41:05,860 --> 01:41:10,860
and their otherwise beloved reputation challenged. Probably the most notable example of this was Ellen,

1395
01:41:10,860 --> 01:41:13,860
who many claimed was an all-round unpleasant person to deal with,

1396
01:41:13,860 --> 01:41:19,860
while the working conditions behind the scenes of her supposedly lovable show were comparable to that of an authoritarian regime.

1397
01:41:19,860 --> 01:41:24,860
Needless to say, whether you believed in every story's verity or not, the effect it had on the show was evident,

1398
01:41:24,860 --> 01:41:27,860
with ratings plummeting, and barely a couple of years later,

1399
01:41:27,860 --> 01:41:32,860
The Ellen DeGeneres Show was brought to an end after 19 seasons of mostly enjoyed success.

1400
01:41:32,860 --> 01:41:35,860
The allegations certainly shook up the industry to say the least,

1401
01:41:35,860 --> 01:41:40,860
and lifted the veil on the often hushed workplace culture that had seldom received scrutiny.

1402
01:41:40,860 --> 01:41:46,860
For many, it was a bad experience, but up until then, many former employees had likely viewed it through the lens of any other job.

1403
01:41:46,860 --> 01:41:51,860
The difference is, when you're dealing with celebrities who preach the principles that aren't necessarily reflected in their private persona,

1404
01:41:51,860 --> 01:41:55,860
there's a disingenuousness to their trade that makes you feel compelled to call them out.

1405
01:41:55,860 --> 01:41:58,860
However, while this was new in many corners of the industry,

1406
01:41:58,860 --> 01:42:02,860
arguably the tabloid talk shows should have been the most conscious of this.

1407
01:42:02,860 --> 01:42:06,860
They've been long subject to criticism regarding maltreatment of those around them,

1408
01:42:06,860 --> 01:42:10,860
especially given the often sensitive and revealing topics surrounding their guests.

1409
01:42:10,860 --> 01:42:15,860
As a matter of fact, in 2016, Dr. Phil and his producers had already been sued by a former employee

1410
01:42:15,860 --> 01:42:17,860
who had claimed they were falsely imprisoned during a meeting,

1411
01:42:17,860 --> 01:42:21,860
when McGraw had locked the doors and threatened employees after information had leaked.

1412
01:42:21,860 --> 01:42:24,860
The producers of Dr. Phil subsequently countersued, claiming that this employee,

1413
01:42:24,860 --> 01:42:29,860
who worked as a producer and director, had lifted footage from the production that infringed on the copyright,

1414
01:42:29,860 --> 01:42:32,860
employment, and confidentiality rights of the show.

1415
01:42:32,860 --> 01:42:36,860
In the end, the judge sided with the producers, and the potential for further publicity seemed to burn out.

1416
01:42:36,860 --> 01:42:41,860
At first, it seemed that Dr. Phil had avoided the blast radius of the talk show apocalypse,

1417
01:42:41,860 --> 01:42:46,860
but barely a few months before Ellen's final episode on February 11th, 2022,

1418
01:42:46,860 --> 01:42:51,860
two present and ten former employees came forward to attest to a work environment that was anything but therapeutic.

1419
01:42:52,860 --> 01:42:56,860
In many ways, the allegations against the Dr. Phil show followed a similar narrative to those that had

1420
01:42:56,860 --> 01:42:58,860
sunk Ellen a couple of years before.

1421
01:42:58,860 --> 01:43:03,860
Although employees on the article did not directly witness McGraw berating or abusing employees,

1422
01:43:03,860 --> 01:43:07,860
many of the producers acted tyrannically towards those working on the show,

1423
01:43:07,860 --> 01:43:10,860
engaging in behaviour that caused serious upset and discomfort.

1424
01:43:10,860 --> 01:43:13,860
With how systemic and widespread the problem was in the workplace,

1425
01:43:13,860 --> 01:43:17,860
many found it difficult to believe that an accomplished, observant psychologist and TV host

1426
01:43:17,860 --> 01:43:20,860
would merely be ignorant to these incidents, with one being quoted as saying,

1427
01:43:20,860 --> 01:43:22,860
how can he not know?

1428
01:43:22,860 --> 01:43:25,860
Most of this centered in on a place called the control room,

1429
01:43:25,860 --> 01:43:28,860
which employees described as a war zone, with yelling, insults,

1430
01:43:28,860 --> 01:43:32,860
and all-round disrespect for employees who worked in those high pressure conditions.

1431
01:43:32,860 --> 01:43:35,860
The one public testimonial in this article comes from Tiffany Clark,

1432
01:43:35,860 --> 01:43:37,860
who briefly did some work on behalf of Paramount.

1433
01:43:37,860 --> 01:43:41,860
She said that during her short tenure, she was mercilessly berated by a supervisor

1434
01:43:41,860 --> 01:43:45,860
who threatened jobs and openly bragged about making other employees quit.

1435
01:43:45,860 --> 01:43:48,860
This information tells us a story endemic to many LA productions,

1436
01:43:48,860 --> 01:43:52,860
and if you remove the names, you probably wouldn't be able to tell it from a show like Ellen.

1437
01:43:52,860 --> 01:43:57,860
However, there was an aspect that set these claims apart from your usual studio hellhole.

1438
01:43:57,860 --> 01:44:01,860
As we noted, there are multiple testimonies that assert that the show subtly nudged guests

1439
01:44:01,860 --> 01:44:05,860
towards problematic behaviour that may be connected with the struggles they were encountering,

1440
01:44:05,860 --> 01:44:08,860
all of whom are from the guests themselves and their relatives.

1441
01:44:08,860 --> 01:44:10,860
However, in this case, the employees appear to back up these claims,

1442
01:44:10,860 --> 01:44:14,860
with multiple stories regarding the instruction they received when handling the show's participants.

1443
01:44:14,860 --> 01:44:17,860
These included being encouraged to perpetuate racial stereotypes,

1444
01:44:17,860 --> 01:44:20,860
not being properly equipped to deal with mentally vulnerable guests,

1445
01:44:20,860 --> 01:44:23,860
and even one case where an employee claims they were directed to make sure a guest

1446
01:44:23,860 --> 01:44:25,860
did not take their medication before going on stage.

1447
01:44:25,860 --> 01:44:29,860
Former members of staff also say they were advised to manipulate and befriend guests

1448
01:44:29,860 --> 01:44:33,860
in an attempt to obtain bookings for the show, while profiling them on a variety of fronts.

1449
01:44:33,860 --> 01:44:37,860
This is partially substantiated by an excerpt from an email that commends workers

1450
01:44:37,860 --> 01:44:39,860
for convincing guests that they're trusted confidants,

1451
01:44:40,860 --> 01:44:44,860
but reminding them to keep their distance, as said guests will likely throw them under the bus,

1452
01:44:44,860 --> 01:44:48,860
not the sort of sympathetic outlook on guests that you'd expect from Dr. Phil.

1453
01:44:48,860 --> 01:44:52,860
By this time, such claims of workplace misconduct were becoming more and more pervasive,

1454
01:44:52,860 --> 01:44:54,860
and for such an environment, maybe that wasn't surprising,

1455
01:44:54,860 --> 01:44:57,860
it seems to be a deeply ingrained cultural issue.

1456
01:44:57,860 --> 01:45:00,860
However, the one aspect that should always be prioritised in this sort of show

1457
01:45:00,860 --> 01:45:04,860
is the safety of guests who genuinely need help above anything else,

1458
01:45:04,860 --> 01:45:07,860
something that Dr. Phil has always publicly preached.

1459
01:45:07,860 --> 01:45:10,860
This didn't appear to be a cultural misstep, this seemed to be intentional,

1460
01:45:10,860 --> 01:45:13,860
and for that, there were much more serious ramifications.

1461
01:45:13,860 --> 01:45:16,860
As always, it's important to present both sides,

1462
01:45:16,860 --> 01:45:19,860
and as many other stories reported, the team behind Dr. Phil did respond,

1463
01:45:19,860 --> 01:45:23,860
firstly denying any of the allegations regarding treatment of staff and guests,

1464
01:45:23,860 --> 01:45:28,860
while also referring their own members of staff to the publication in support of their perspective.

1465
01:45:28,860 --> 01:45:31,860
Their angle was that yes, filming of a show like Dr. Phil could be intense,

1466
01:45:31,860 --> 01:45:34,860
especially considering the unpredictability of those involved.

1467
01:45:34,860 --> 01:45:37,860
However, nobody has been abused, nobody has been treated unfairly,

1468
01:45:37,860 --> 01:45:43,860
and nobody was subjected to any forms of profiling or stereotyping under the watch of a show's executive.

1469
01:45:43,860 --> 01:45:48,860
We can't support one experience unquestionably without taking into account the other experiences,

1470
01:45:48,860 --> 01:45:53,860
and obviously the producers offered individuals who contradicted the accusatory testimonies written in the article.

1471
01:45:53,860 --> 01:45:57,860
However, the report definitely outlined a continuing narrative on the Dr. Phil show,

1472
01:45:57,860 --> 01:45:59,860
one that it was struggling to shake off.

1473
01:45:59,860 --> 01:46:01,860
This isn't the first time that such claims have been made,

1474
01:46:02,860 --> 01:46:05,860
and although an intensive workshop may create disgruntled employees,

1475
01:46:05,860 --> 01:46:10,860
it's hardly a complete explanation for the often corroborating stories from supposedly separate sources.

1476
01:46:10,860 --> 01:46:12,860
All I'd say is that in this case,

1477
01:46:12,860 --> 01:46:16,860
it's hard to blame people for believing what was being said with the information available,

1478
01:46:16,860 --> 01:46:19,860
whereas in the past, the Dr. Phil show had cast doubt on the guests and their families

1479
01:46:19,860 --> 01:46:24,860
by pointing to the possibility of ulterior motives and the fact that certain memories may be corrupted,

1480
01:46:24,860 --> 01:46:26,860
that didn't really apply here.

1481
01:46:26,860 --> 01:46:29,860
To be frank, there wasn't a copious amount of new evidence being presented,

1482
01:46:29,860 --> 01:46:33,860
but these claims were substantiated by what was already publicly available to viewers,

1483
01:46:33,860 --> 01:46:38,860
and only added an additional layer of credibility to the criticisms being levelled against the Dr. Phil crew.

1484
01:46:38,860 --> 01:46:41,860
But could it tell us anything about the man himself?

1485
01:47:00,860 --> 01:47:06,860
Other than the lawsuit in 2016,

1486
01:47:06,860 --> 01:47:11,860
we didn't really have much evidence that supported this idea that Dr. Phil was an outwardly unpleasant person

1487
01:47:11,860 --> 01:47:15,860
to those around him, and to be fair, you can't control everything your employees say or do.

1488
01:47:15,860 --> 01:47:20,860
However, many would argue that he had presented himself as a hands-on person who cared about making a difference

1489
01:47:20,860 --> 01:47:23,860
in these people's lives, and this seemed to contradict that.

1490
01:47:23,860 --> 01:47:26,860
Now, with everything considered, the show still hasn't picked up too much plaque,

1491
01:47:26,860 --> 01:47:29,860
I think mainly because controversy comes with the territory,

1492
01:47:29,860 --> 01:47:32,860
and such TV shows are never going to be completely unproblematic.

1493
01:47:32,860 --> 01:47:37,860
Whereas someone like Ellen was meant to represent an environment where people could just be unbridled in their joy,

1494
01:47:37,860 --> 01:47:40,860
Dr. Phil thrives on the energy of the guests as well,

1495
01:47:40,860 --> 01:47:45,860
many of whom bring their own, sometimes less-than-positive spirit to the stage.

1496
01:47:45,860 --> 01:47:48,860
That chaos seemed more in-built with that structure,

1497
01:47:48,860 --> 01:47:51,860
which unfortunately makes such workplace misconduct stand out less.

1498
01:47:51,860 --> 01:47:54,860
It's not a surprise that the Dr. Phil machine has mostly persisted,

1499
01:47:54,860 --> 01:47:57,860
rather unscathed from the troubles of the past few years.

1500
01:47:57,860 --> 01:48:00,860
However, this hasn't stopped people from asking questions,

1501
01:48:00,860 --> 01:48:03,860
and I think as skepticism of this form of therapy content in general rises,

1502
01:48:03,860 --> 01:48:08,860
then people are likely to revisit these claims, and time won't necessarily nullify them.

1503
01:48:08,860 --> 01:48:11,860
When put together in one place, they do tell a damning story,

1504
01:48:11,860 --> 01:48:16,860
and one that doesn't present the most flattering image of one of TV's most famous therapists.

1505
01:48:16,860 --> 01:48:19,860
Creating compelling television is always a struggle,

1506
01:48:19,860 --> 01:48:22,860
because a lot of people want to see what they often can't see in their own lives.

1507
01:48:22,860 --> 01:48:26,860
Therapy is one of those things that is personal, it's between two private individuals,

1508
01:48:26,860 --> 01:48:31,860
and obviously, for many in the psychological field, that confidentiality is part of the process,

1509
01:48:31,860 --> 01:48:36,860
a place where you can talk about your deepest, darkest thoughts with the hope of eventually expelling them.

1510
01:48:36,860 --> 01:48:41,860
It's hard to do something publicly when many would argue that privacy is part of its necessity.

1511
01:48:41,860 --> 01:48:44,860
After all, as people like Daniel Bregoli show,

1512
01:48:44,860 --> 01:48:48,860
when cameras and audience members are viewing you, you're conditioned to behave differently.

1513
01:48:48,860 --> 01:48:52,860
However, I also think there is value in people being open about their struggles,

1514
01:48:52,860 --> 01:48:55,860
and there being a medium to connect with that over.

1515
01:48:55,860 --> 01:48:59,860
There may not be a right way to do this, but there is a best way to do this.

1516
01:48:59,860 --> 01:49:03,860
By 2022, I think that critics had lost faith that this was the best way,

1517
01:49:03,860 --> 01:49:05,860
or that it was even a worthwhile route.

1518
01:49:05,860 --> 01:49:08,860
Whether it was Dr. Phil's individual will or not,

1519
01:49:08,860 --> 01:49:12,860
there were clearly conflicts of interest between driving the vehicle that creates entertaining TV,

1520
01:49:12,860 --> 01:49:15,860
and actually protecting the world being a vulnerable guest.

1521
01:49:15,860 --> 01:49:19,860
Even discounting the allegations, many of the clips spoke for themselves.

1522
01:49:19,860 --> 01:49:20,860
Hi, Dr. Phil.

1523
01:49:20,860 --> 01:49:24,860
Hi, I'm Todd. Nice to meet you.

1524
01:49:24,860 --> 01:49:27,860
How are you feeling, man? Can you walk?

1525
01:49:27,860 --> 01:49:32,860
Apparently, I have to have help.

1526
01:49:32,860 --> 01:49:34,860
Sorry, I'm very...

1527
01:49:34,860 --> 01:49:37,860
Although you could certainly attribute certain blame to individuals,

1528
01:49:37,860 --> 01:49:41,860
I think there was also a great question looming over the show that McGraw operated,

1529
01:49:41,860 --> 01:49:43,860
particularly regarding its methodology.

1530
01:49:43,860 --> 01:49:48,860
The prioritization of tell-all television is something that's always been valued in the industry.

1531
01:49:48,860 --> 01:49:51,860
However, I think there were new elements that Dr. Phil introduced

1532
01:49:51,860 --> 01:49:56,860
which made that pursuit more dangerous for people who may find themselves in a vulnerable place.

1533
01:49:56,860 --> 01:50:01,860
In a way, what the Dr. Phil show promoted as its greatest facets were also its greatest problems.

1534
01:50:01,860 --> 01:50:05,860
We return to this point of help, the one that McGraw helped set the program apart with

1535
01:50:05,860 --> 01:50:08,860
by collaborating with all these centers and clinics.

1536
01:50:08,860 --> 01:50:13,860
To me, it seems that the Dr. Phil showrunners either didn't realize the level of height and responsibility

1537
01:50:13,860 --> 01:50:16,860
that rested on their shoulders, or were aware and simply did not care.

1538
01:50:16,860 --> 01:50:22,860
One allegation in particular comes to mind, that made by the mother who had to visit Skid Row with her daughter,

1539
01:50:22,860 --> 01:50:25,860
that she'd been told that if she wanted her daughter to receive treatment that they were offering,

1540
01:50:25,860 --> 01:50:29,860
she would have to cooperate with the narrative being spun on stage.

1541
01:50:29,860 --> 01:50:33,860
I feel it's a believable scenario, but even if the details weren't exactly so,

1542
01:50:33,860 --> 01:50:37,860
I do think it underlines the extremely sensitive power dynamic that is present during the show.

1543
01:50:37,860 --> 01:50:42,860
On one hand, the notion of receiving help is a good idea that hasn't been nearly present in enough of these shows.

1544
01:50:42,860 --> 01:50:46,860
However, as the only party that can provide that help in these scenarios,

1545
01:50:46,860 --> 01:50:50,860
there's also an invisible dependence that is experienced by many of the guests.

1546
01:50:50,860 --> 01:50:54,860
They're relying on the show to offer that help, but that help is chosen by the show

1547
01:50:54,860 --> 01:50:57,860
and can be withdrawn at any time, as Dr. Phil explained himself.

1548
01:50:57,860 --> 01:51:02,860
One thing I knew for sure is that these girls were not ready to be home because home wasn't ready for these girls.

1549
01:51:02,860 --> 01:51:08,860
I told you that, I was clear about it, and then you say, well, I've actually talked to some other experts,

1550
01:51:08,860 --> 01:51:14,860
then you need to do what they want you to do. Best of luck to you, but I'm not going to support that.

1551
01:51:14,860 --> 01:51:18,860
Who wouldn't want to cooperate with Dr. Phil's narratives in these cases,

1552
01:51:18,860 --> 01:51:21,860
particularly when a person in your relationship with them are at stake,

1553
01:51:21,860 --> 01:51:24,860
and these people are their friends, their family.

1554
01:51:24,860 --> 01:51:28,860
Fleeting public dignity is a small price to pay to help your struggling relative to survive.

1555
01:51:28,860 --> 01:51:32,860
Dr. Phil said that he wasn't involved in the actual treatment after his show,

1556
01:51:32,860 --> 01:51:35,860
and that statement's falsehood is borderline self-explanatory.

1557
01:51:35,860 --> 01:51:38,860
If that statement was true, then this dynamic would never have existed,

1558
01:51:38,860 --> 01:51:42,860
as the help offered would be independent of whatever Dr. Phil says on his show.

1559
01:51:42,860 --> 01:51:44,860
Instead, they're intertwined.

1560
01:51:44,860 --> 01:51:49,860
The behavior exhibited on Dr. Phil's show directly influences the treatment these individuals receive.

1561
01:51:49,860 --> 01:51:52,860
Their actions on air dictates Dr. Phil's recommendations,

1562
01:51:52,860 --> 01:51:57,860
despite the many extraneous variables that can influence their deportment during these episodes.

1563
01:51:57,860 --> 01:52:01,860
Many of these people's progress continues to be covered and critiqued in front of the cameras,

1564
01:52:01,860 --> 01:52:05,860
even in these clinics and therapy centers. It's part of the show.

1565
01:52:05,860 --> 01:52:07,860
And if that's the choice of the show, then so be it,

1566
01:52:07,860 --> 01:52:11,860
but you have to acknowledge that it's a flaw system that can yield some complications,

1567
01:52:11,860 --> 01:52:16,860
and that it is an effect of the show you operate, regardless of whether you wish to admit it.

1568
01:52:16,860 --> 01:52:21,860
But if we're going to do this, we're going to do this my way.

1569
01:52:21,860 --> 01:52:25,860
So even if that help was flawed, many didn't want to cry or criticize it

1570
01:52:25,860 --> 01:52:28,860
because it could influence how they received that help.

1571
01:52:28,860 --> 01:52:32,860
Dr. Phil's seal of approval propelled a lot of these places into the spotlight,

1572
01:52:32,860 --> 01:52:34,860
and even if someone had a negative experience with such a place,

1573
01:52:34,860 --> 01:52:38,860
they may hesitate to speak up if they still have loved ones involved in the treatment.

1574
01:52:38,860 --> 01:52:44,860
And who would dare question the moral authority of someone as revered as Dr. Phil McGraw?

1575
01:52:44,860 --> 01:52:48,860
With all this in mind, it just makes his first response even worse.

1576
01:52:48,860 --> 01:52:55,860
We don't have anything to do with what happens with guests once they leave the stage.

1577
01:52:55,860 --> 01:53:01,860
If there is any shred of truth in what he said, it means that he had no investment or interest

1578
01:53:01,860 --> 01:53:06,860
in the quality of care provided by a lot of these places that he rode so hard for in his shows.

1579
01:53:06,860 --> 01:53:10,860
And these weren't simple sponsorships that people could go to if they wanted to,

1580
01:53:10,860 --> 01:53:14,860
these are the places that were offered specifically, and with all this in mind,

1581
01:53:14,860 --> 01:53:20,860
it becomes hard to buy that Dr. Phil had no knowledge whatsoever of the incidents that occurred at many of these places.

1582
01:53:20,860 --> 01:53:25,860
In a way, his response distanced himself far too much to the point where it just was not believable,

1583
01:53:25,860 --> 01:53:30,860
and a more straightforward theory seemed to emerge that shone a much darker light onto the show,

1584
01:53:30,860 --> 01:53:32,860
and how it had been operated.

1585
01:53:38,860 --> 01:53:43,860
Amongst the quagmire of other shows in the genre that regularly sought to put guests on the spot

1586
01:53:43,860 --> 01:53:48,860
in private affairs, indiscretions, and matters that only reserved as entertainment for the baying crowds.

1587
01:53:48,860 --> 01:53:52,860
Dr. Phil stood out to many, a beacon in how topics could be tackled on television.

1588
01:53:52,860 --> 01:53:58,860
Thanks to his skills, McGraw was often able to navigate topics and address guests in ways that appeared fair and astute.

1589
01:53:58,860 --> 01:54:05,860
The pursuit of perfection is, in and of itself, a flawed pursuit, because there is no perfection, you know that.

1590
01:54:05,860 --> 01:54:09,860
Nothing can ever get straight enough, perfect enough, clean enough, right enough.

1591
01:54:09,860 --> 01:54:12,860
Because if it is, you've got to go back and check it, right?

1592
01:54:12,860 --> 01:54:17,860
It didn't just make him popular with audiences, who felt his approach represented a more humanised perspective of guests,

1593
01:54:17,860 --> 01:54:22,860
but also with studios, who were often learning the hard way that such formulas could lead to disaster.

1594
01:54:22,860 --> 01:54:27,860
There has been no large-scale disaster on the Dr. Phil show, nothing that has defined the legacy of the show,

1595
01:54:27,860 --> 01:54:31,860
and as the ratings of competitors dropped, McGraw's ship remained stable.

1596
01:54:31,860 --> 01:54:38,860
The lack of emotional provocation directly from Dr. Phil often meant that people really couldn't do much with actual legal complaints.

1597
01:54:38,860 --> 01:54:44,860
Whatever happened couldn't directly be linked back to an appearance on Dr. Phil, it's not illegal to have guests after all.

1598
01:54:44,860 --> 01:54:50,860
There has to be some level of personal responsibility, something that Dr. Phil has always preached.

1599
01:54:50,860 --> 01:54:57,860
In a lot of tabloid talk shows, their format enabled responsibility for any misconduct to be assigned to the producers and the host,

1600
01:54:57,860 --> 01:55:01,860
because of their language and behaviour that may have affected the actions of these guests,

1601
01:55:01,860 --> 01:55:03,860
not just on the show, but subsequently after the show.

1602
01:55:03,860 --> 01:55:09,860
The public crucifixion many people were often subject to was life-ruining, a fate I wouldn't wish on nearly anyone,

1603
01:55:09,860 --> 01:55:14,860
and when these consequences became apparent, I think a lot of people realised TV needed to change.

1604
01:55:14,860 --> 01:55:19,860
Dr. Phil seemed above that, though, his show seemed to occupy this very neutral sphere,

1605
01:55:19,860 --> 01:55:23,860
where they merely provided a platform for these discussions and interventions to occur.

1606
01:55:23,860 --> 01:55:27,860
Whatever happened otherwise was ultimately the result of decisions made by individuals.

1607
01:55:28,860 --> 01:55:31,860
This reputation was bolstered by Dr. Phil's image and background,

1608
01:55:31,860 --> 01:55:35,860
which often applauded him as a professional voice whose words were rooted in scientific observation.

1609
01:55:35,860 --> 01:55:41,860
Although acknowledging that he was not a medical doctor or even a practicing psychologist, McGraw still leaned into this image,

1610
01:55:41,860 --> 01:55:46,860
with many products, shows, and public appearances that promoted him as a credible voice within the sphere.

1611
01:55:46,860 --> 01:55:52,860
All of this established him as a neutral, mild TV personality who merely wanted to teach people some common sense,

1612
01:55:52,860 --> 01:55:55,860
and his self-titled show followed that formula.

1613
01:55:55,860 --> 01:55:59,860
This perspective was reflected in Dr. Phil's response to Danielle Bregoli.

1614
01:55:59,860 --> 01:56:04,860
All he does on the show is sit there and make observations and recommend the support a person should receive.

1615
01:56:04,860 --> 01:56:08,860
The observation approach prides itself on attempting to dissect these subjects from a factual basis

1616
01:56:08,860 --> 01:56:13,860
and in a way that allows individuals to present themselves in their unfiltered, unprovoked form.

1617
01:56:13,860 --> 01:56:17,860
Now, in principle, it was questionable whether such a format could ever be truly neutral.

1618
01:56:17,860 --> 01:56:22,860
The involvement of an audience, TV cameras, sure, on paper, they're not directly accountable to a studio,

1619
01:56:22,860 --> 01:56:26,860
but they still influence outcomes of possible interventions and discussions

1620
01:56:26,860 --> 01:56:30,860
that would regularly refer to intimate and revealing details broadcast out there for eternity.

1621
01:56:30,860 --> 01:56:36,860
Yet you could defend the show on the basis that there has to be some public exposure for it to constitute a show at all.

1622
01:56:36,860 --> 01:56:40,860
Nevertheless, there were definitely certain hoops they'd have to jump through to retain this defence,

1623
01:56:40,860 --> 01:56:42,860
which is what some began to question.

1624
01:56:42,860 --> 01:56:47,860
First, you have that dynamic of dependence between the guests and the showrunners, then unspoken, assumed debt,

1625
01:56:47,860 --> 01:56:51,860
one that could very easily dictate personal behaviour and commentary on it.

1626
01:56:51,860 --> 01:56:56,860
However, deeper than that, we have the actual alleged conduct undertaken by people working behind the scenes,

1627
01:56:56,860 --> 01:57:00,860
that seemed to challenge their guests and their own personal responsibility for their demons.

1628
01:57:00,860 --> 01:57:04,860
As it's been preached, personal responsibility was extremely important,

1629
01:57:04,860 --> 01:57:08,860
and as far as we know, the crew of Dr. Phil never forced any guest's hand in their actions.

1630
01:57:08,860 --> 01:57:14,860
However, on multiple occasions, the Dr. Phil show appeared to be more orchestrated than those behind it were prepared to admit.

1631
01:57:14,860 --> 01:57:20,860
Their behaviour in attempting to make TV more engaging seemed to announce to nudging certain guests towards detrimental actions,

1632
01:57:20,860 --> 01:57:25,860
not safeguarding vulnerable individuals properly, and prioritising their business deals and spicy stories

1633
01:57:25,860 --> 01:57:29,860
over the actual wellbeing and autonomy of some of those who they covered.

1634
01:57:29,860 --> 01:57:35,860
Each allegation seemed to tell the same story, that although there seemed to be no active sabotage conducted by producers,

1635
01:57:35,860 --> 01:57:39,860
they pushed the responsibility of difficult decisions onto distressed guests to generate conflict,

1636
01:57:39,860 --> 01:57:43,860
which would then be touched on by the surly host, who would hold them accountable.

1637
01:57:44,860 --> 01:57:49,860
I have no excuse. I didn't want her to withdraw. I know that we did try and take her to the hospital,

1638
01:57:49,860 --> 01:57:56,860
and she ended up leaving. I don't have an answer for why I did what I did. I just wanted to help her feel better.

1639
01:57:56,860 --> 01:57:59,860
So you got the heroin, right? How did you take it?

1640
01:57:59,860 --> 01:58:00,860
Injected it.

1641
01:58:00,860 --> 01:58:05,860
So you bought heroin that she pumped into her veins, and therefore into the baby's veins.

1642
01:58:05,860 --> 01:58:06,860
Yes.

1643
01:58:06,860 --> 01:58:08,860
So that baby is high on heroin.

1644
01:58:08,860 --> 01:58:11,860
It's a very curious connection between many of the stories.

1645
01:58:11,860 --> 01:58:15,860
This is not one that people would necessarily consciously concoct to be consistent with other claims,

1646
01:58:15,860 --> 01:58:20,860
but they suggested that the Dr Phil Producers indulged a sweet spot between the show's responsibility,

1647
01:58:20,860 --> 01:58:22,860
and the guests' responsibility.

1648
01:58:22,860 --> 01:58:25,860
Sure, they didn't necessarily make these guest decisions for them,

1649
01:58:25,860 --> 01:58:28,860
but they put them in a position where many of them felt like they had no other option,

1650
01:58:28,860 --> 01:58:32,860
whether that's due to the unspoken dynamic, or the outwardly spoken words.

1651
01:58:32,860 --> 01:58:36,860
Even if it seems like they have a choice, it's almost its own illusion.

1652
01:58:36,860 --> 01:58:38,860
The presence of an audience makes this even more difficult,

1653
01:58:38,860 --> 01:58:41,860
because given almost all of them are likely to be in favour of Dr Phil,

1654
01:58:41,860 --> 01:58:46,860
try his ascent, and you're arguing against a hundred more people who have complete free reign to vocalise those feelings.

1655
01:58:46,860 --> 01:58:49,860
It's not hard to tell which side they're going to take.

1656
01:58:49,860 --> 01:58:55,860
We know the central narrative of a show like this will always aim to present Dr Phil lifting people out of a struggle.

1657
01:58:55,860 --> 01:59:01,860
He has to be their saviour, but they shouldn't have to manipulate scenarios to ensure that a person has a struggle to be lifted out of.

1658
01:59:02,860 --> 01:59:07,860
As their PR guru once said, those people were already encountering difficulties at the time that they arrived.

1659
01:59:07,860 --> 01:59:11,860
What happens at the show may not have too much of a direct bearing on those specific issues,

1660
01:59:11,860 --> 01:59:14,860
yet just because someone is suffering from a problem,

1661
01:59:14,860 --> 01:59:19,860
doesn't mean that an appearance on public television is just like any other Tuesday when addressing it.

1662
01:59:19,860 --> 01:59:22,860
That sort of show can be a make or break situation for a person's wellbeing.

1663
01:59:22,860 --> 01:59:26,860
You see, whereas Greenberg's statement was used to defer responsibility,

1664
01:59:26,860 --> 01:59:28,860
many would use it to bestow greater responsibility.

1665
01:59:28,860 --> 01:59:34,860
Just because someone is fighting their own personal battle doesn't mean you can't provide some reinforcements here or there,

1666
01:59:34,860 --> 01:59:36,860
and you have to make the best TV out of it.

1667
01:59:36,860 --> 01:59:43,860
Although they had established a prestige amongst many viewers as the show that provided the most sincere platform for people to share their struggles,

1668
01:59:43,860 --> 01:59:47,860
their set up enabled a bulletproof formula that would yield the results they wanted,

1669
01:59:47,860 --> 01:59:52,860
reaping the credit for everything that went right without making them too responsible for the things that went wrong,

1670
01:59:52,860 --> 01:59:56,860
exploiting nearly every medium possible to maximise their own success.

1671
01:59:56,860 --> 02:00:03,860
But in spite of its continued success, are the curtains finally coming down on this iconic daytime show?

1672
02:00:11,860 --> 02:00:15,860
The year is 2022, and Dr. Phil has been up and running for 20 seasons.

1673
02:00:15,860 --> 02:00:21,860
It has outlasted nearly every tabloid talk show, a majority of normal talk shows, including Oprah,

1674
02:00:21,860 --> 02:00:23,860
and still pulls significant viewership.

1675
02:00:23,860 --> 02:00:25,860
He must have done something right.

1676
02:00:25,860 --> 02:00:30,860
While in many ways, Dr. Phil achieved a feat unrivalled by nearly every other daytime show,

1677
02:00:30,860 --> 02:00:36,860
regardless of when or how it ends, it will have irrevocably changed many people's lives, for better and sometimes for worse.

1678
02:00:36,860 --> 02:00:41,860
McGraw has influenced multiple generations of people on how they may approach the topics of mental health,

1679
02:00:41,860 --> 02:00:43,860
and many other sensitive subjects surrounding the matter,

1680
02:00:43,860 --> 02:00:47,860
which is probably why people find the show such a hotbed for modern day discussion.

1681
02:00:47,860 --> 02:00:51,860
It's influenced how people seek help, put a face on a lot of unknown conditions,

1682
02:00:51,860 --> 02:00:55,860
and platformed important discussions that were often considered too taboo for mainstream television.

1683
02:01:15,860 --> 02:01:19,860
There's no doubt that many of those subjects covered by Dr. Phil will remain relevant for decades to come,

1684
02:01:19,860 --> 02:01:25,860
but will the man himself be at the forefront of it? With all that's been discussed today, I'm not entirely sure.

1685
02:01:25,860 --> 02:01:31,860
Dr. Phil's venture into the online community definitely gave him and the show a second wind that very few could have predicted.

1686
02:01:31,860 --> 02:01:35,860
It made him relevant with a new audience, and refreshed him in the memory of old ones.

1687
02:01:35,860 --> 02:01:40,860
However, success in the online world does come with the acknowledgement that you don't always have the control of public perception

1688
02:01:40,860 --> 02:01:42,860
that you might have on other mediums.

1689
02:01:42,860 --> 02:01:47,860
It didn't help that at its core, Dr. Phil was still old school syndicated television.

1690
02:01:47,860 --> 02:01:51,860
They didn't really adjust their rules depending on who was watching or talking about them.

1691
02:01:51,860 --> 02:01:54,860
Certain pursuits that became quite easy to criticise were picked up on,

1692
02:01:54,860 --> 02:01:57,860
and even though it was likely fairly standard procedure when the show was launched,

1693
02:01:57,860 --> 02:02:03,860
by this time people clearly realised there had to be somewhat more rigorous moral standards with the content he was producing,

1694
02:02:03,860 --> 02:02:08,860
and when he eventually got involved in the pinnacle of what every online figure dreads, drama,

1695
02:02:08,860 --> 02:02:11,860
his response was clearly taken from the TV template of admitting nothing.

1696
02:02:11,860 --> 02:02:15,860
The only problem was that it just wasn't believable at all.

1697
02:02:15,860 --> 02:02:22,860
In 2018, owing to its continued success, Dr. Phil was nude for an additional four seasons, running up until May 2023.

1698
02:02:22,860 --> 02:02:26,860
This was quite the feat all things considered, however, in the last couple years,

1699
02:02:26,860 --> 02:02:31,860
it has lost its syndicated crown to other shows, including Live with Kelly and Ryan and The View.

1700
02:02:31,860 --> 02:02:37,860
Now, this isn't to say the ratings still haven't been strong, Dr. Phil still pulls a significant viewership all things considered,

1701
02:02:37,860 --> 02:02:43,860
but whereas in March 2020 he was pulling a Nielsen rating of 2.8, by the end of 2021 that had dropped to 1.4,

1702
02:02:43,860 --> 02:02:47,860
and it seems somewhat uncertain if there will be a further extension to the show's lifespan.

1703
02:02:47,860 --> 02:02:52,860
On the basis of the numbers alone, I'd say they have reason to renew, however, on the basis of the trend,

1704
02:02:52,860 --> 02:02:57,860
I'd say they're probably aware of the risk. In August 2022, for the start of Season 21,

1705
02:02:57,860 --> 02:03:02,860
they laid off 25 staffers in a move to cut costs, and although the studio downplayed the move,

1706
02:03:02,860 --> 02:03:07,860
it's hard to ignore such significant downsizing, especially given the stories that had come out over the year before.

1707
02:03:07,860 --> 02:03:12,860
The only real piece of good news for the show came from the result of the lawsuit regarding Turnabout Ranch,

1708
02:03:12,860 --> 02:03:15,860
which Jones dismissed as ultimately not having strong enough grounds to pursue.

1709
02:03:15,860 --> 02:03:20,860
Having probably the most TV company move of them all, the response of the Dr. Phil show was to request the court

1710
02:03:20,860 --> 02:03:25,860
to have the former guest, Archer Letter, pay them $400,000 in legal fees,

1711
02:03:25,860 --> 02:03:28,860
which seems just a bit tasteless considering the sensitivity of the case,

1712
02:03:28,860 --> 02:03:32,860
and the fact that a separate lawsuit against Turnabout Ranch has yet to be concluded.

1713
02:03:32,860 --> 02:03:38,860
But that's just my take, I could point towards one specific story and say that it was the straw that broke the camel's back,

1714
02:03:38,860 --> 02:03:43,860
but really, I think it's just the result of gradual attrition, a formula being worn to the bone,

1715
02:03:43,860 --> 02:03:46,860
and people finally realising it wasn't the TV that it claimed to be.

1716
02:03:46,860 --> 02:03:50,860
I think that back in the day, when it was competing with shows that regularly skewered their guests

1717
02:03:50,860 --> 02:03:55,860
and made the grandest spectacle of each situation, Dr. Phil could be that more humane alternative.

1718
02:03:55,860 --> 02:04:00,860
With the rise of the internet, and Dr. Phil's own participation in it, they found themselves out of step

1719
02:04:00,860 --> 02:04:04,860
with more refined documentaries, and psychological analyses of situations by credited experts

1720
02:04:04,860 --> 02:04:08,860
who treat these topics with much more reverence than Dr. Phil ever did.

1721
02:04:08,860 --> 02:04:12,860
McGraw's show still has the edge in the fact that it often directly involves these subjects,

1722
02:04:12,860 --> 02:04:15,860
and the fact that they can actually offer treatment and coverage of such,

1723
02:04:15,860 --> 02:04:18,860
but that has been overshadowed by the questions surrounding a lot of these treatment centres,

1724
02:04:18,860 --> 02:04:21,860
and Dr. Phil's own relationship with them.

1725
02:04:21,860 --> 02:04:24,860
YouTubers who worked with counselling site BetterHelp came under criticism

1726
02:04:24,860 --> 02:04:28,860
after the company found themselves mired in controversy regarding the status of some professionals,

1727
02:04:28,860 --> 02:04:32,860
and some creators were thought to have not actually used the site they were promoting.

1728
02:04:32,860 --> 02:04:36,860
That is a drop in the ocean compared to what McGraw has appeared to greenlight.

1729
02:04:36,860 --> 02:04:41,860
Lawsuit regarding Turnabout Ranch has also further torn a hole in that previously impenetrable reputation.

1730
02:04:41,860 --> 02:04:46,860
Although lawsuits were not necessarily anything new to Dr. Phil, and certainly this result wasn't,

1731
02:04:46,860 --> 02:04:49,860
the media coverage, the names attached, and the possible precedent that could have been set

1732
02:04:49,860 --> 02:04:52,860
if they had found McGraw and his crew culpable for their recommendation

1733
02:04:52,860 --> 02:04:55,860
is enough to give many studios cold feet.

1734
02:04:55,860 --> 02:04:59,860
This probably wouldn't have even been conceivable when the show started up in the early 2000s,

1735
02:04:59,860 --> 02:05:04,860
with TV the medium, and guests making one or two appearances before being forgotten in the run of episodes.

1736
02:05:04,860 --> 02:05:09,860
With the online world immortalising much of this content, mostly the behest of Dr. Phil's production team,

1737
02:05:09,860 --> 02:05:12,860
their strength of reaching a new audience is also that vulnerability.

1738
02:05:12,860 --> 02:05:17,860
Like a lot of TV shows, and even media in general, Dr. Phil was ahead of its time when it made its debut,

1739
02:05:17,860 --> 02:05:20,860
but has fallen behind the evolving zeitgeist of the years have passed,

1740
02:05:20,860 --> 02:05:24,860
and it seems too resistant to the change it would need to undertake to overcome that.

1741
02:05:24,860 --> 02:05:28,860
Maybe Phil's format just wasn't capable of something more human,

1742
02:05:28,860 --> 02:05:31,860
or maybe it was, but wasn't prepared to make that change.

1743
02:05:31,860 --> 02:05:36,860
I believe I can bring him really quality help, and I think he can respond to that,

1744
02:05:36,860 --> 02:05:39,860
and I think he probably will.

1745
02:05:39,860 --> 02:05:44,860
In principle, I don't think it would be completely impossible to overhaul the current system in place.

1746
02:05:44,860 --> 02:05:48,860
However, I think the issue is that when a show becomes so established over a long period of time,

1747
02:05:48,860 --> 02:05:53,860
it digs its roots in which makes it very difficult for certain changes to be affected.

1748
02:05:53,860 --> 02:05:57,860
The additional problem is that your remaining audience may only be comfortable with your current format,

1749
02:05:57,860 --> 02:06:01,860
so even if your numbers are down currently, you still risk distancing the law of viewers

1750
02:06:01,860 --> 02:06:05,860
by completely renovating the show that so many of those viewers have come to appreciate.

1751
02:06:05,860 --> 02:06:08,860
But is it radical to ask for a bit more humanity?

1752
02:06:08,860 --> 02:06:13,860
Arguably, much of what we discuss today wouldn't necessarily require that many adjustments,

1753
02:06:13,860 --> 02:06:16,860
just a heightened sensitivity and improved safeguarding.

1754
02:06:16,860 --> 02:06:19,860
However, even that may be a bit too much for a show that at its core,

1755
02:06:19,860 --> 02:06:23,860
still thrived on the drama that it superficially seemed to seek distance from.

1756
02:06:23,860 --> 02:06:27,860
And to be brutally honest, maybe that's what people wanted.

1757
02:06:32,860 --> 02:06:34,860
We've discussed this in the past with the Ellen video,

1758
02:06:34,860 --> 02:06:37,860
but one of the aspects of a modern talk show that appeals to so many people

1759
02:06:37,860 --> 02:06:42,860
is this thought that what you're receiving is an unfiltered, authentic version of a person.

1760
02:06:42,860 --> 02:06:44,860
Unfortunately, Hollywood ruins most things,

1761
02:06:44,860 --> 02:06:48,860
and for studios, it often seems easier to manufacture the illusion of an authentic atmosphere

1762
02:06:48,860 --> 02:06:50,860
than to actually craft one organically.

1763
02:06:50,860 --> 02:06:53,860
Yet if people are none the wiser to this assembly, then who can it harm?

1764
02:06:53,860 --> 02:06:57,860
Well in principle, it doesn't have to harm anyone if it's managed correctly.

1765
02:06:57,860 --> 02:07:01,860
The problem is that a formula based on deception doesn't tend to attract the most sincere characters,

1766
02:07:01,860 --> 02:07:05,860
and when you're dealing with topics like mental health, there tends to be more at stake.

1767
02:07:05,860 --> 02:07:08,860
You can't blame audiences for only seeing what they want to see,

1768
02:07:08,860 --> 02:07:12,860
because in truth, they often only see what the TV producers want to see.

1769
02:07:12,860 --> 02:07:16,860
But anything catered to being more realistic would probably undermine the studio's version

1770
02:07:16,860 --> 02:07:19,860
of how authentic such TV shows should appear.

1771
02:07:19,860 --> 02:07:22,860
Every show has an angle, because it's what sells.

1772
02:07:22,860 --> 02:07:25,860
Dr. Phil was often presented as a selfless endeavour,

1773
02:07:25,860 --> 02:07:29,860
an altruistic drive to help people beat their demons and get their lives back on track.

1774
02:07:29,860 --> 02:07:32,860
Finally, a format for a show based around the needs of a guest.

1775
02:07:32,860 --> 02:07:37,860
However, I think over time it became clear to audiences that it wasn't exactly about helping,

1776
02:07:37,860 --> 02:07:39,860
it was more about people believing you're helping.

1777
02:07:39,860 --> 02:07:42,860
We've already addressed how cameras affect the guests on the show,

1778
02:07:42,860 --> 02:07:44,860
but the cameras also affect Dr. Phil,

1779
02:07:44,860 --> 02:07:47,860
and when they were rolling, people received a seemingly measured and earnest persona,

1780
02:07:47,860 --> 02:07:49,860
but a persona nonetheless.

1781
02:07:49,860 --> 02:07:53,860
This was a one-man franchise, anything that threatened that image was quickly dispatched on.

1782
02:07:53,860 --> 02:07:55,860
Good morning to you, Ty.

1783
02:07:55,860 --> 02:07:56,860
Hey, Bump Fights, baby.

1784
02:07:56,860 --> 02:07:58,860
Is that a wig you're wearing?

1785
02:07:58,860 --> 02:07:59,860
No, real hair.

1786
02:07:59,860 --> 02:08:05,860
Real hair, just curious, because I understand you're not using your real name, and I wonder why that is.

1787
02:08:05,860 --> 02:08:10,860
Well, no, Ty Beast is my real name, I'm a film student out of USC,

1788
02:08:10,860 --> 02:08:15,860
and it took three years to put together the footage for the Bump Fights, and now it's out.

1789
02:08:15,860 --> 02:08:17,860
And now the police come calling.

1790
02:08:17,860 --> 02:08:20,860
Well, I'm not worried about it, I don't think I've done anything wrong.

1791
02:08:20,860 --> 02:08:23,860
It's been a long video, but I do have one more story for you.

1792
02:08:23,860 --> 02:08:27,860
Yes, an incident that has acquired internet fame allegedly involving the creator of Bump Fights,

1793
02:08:27,860 --> 02:08:32,860
Ty Beaston, is often pointed to by critics as a perfect example of what we're discussing today.

1794
02:08:32,860 --> 02:08:39,860
Now, I have to warn you, some of this footage that you're about to see is clearly inappropriate for young viewers.

1795
02:08:39,860 --> 02:08:42,860
Please ask your children to leave the room, and I'm serious,

1796
02:08:42,860 --> 02:08:48,860
you really don't want your kids watching this, and it's not gonna be fun for you to see it.

1797
02:08:48,860 --> 02:08:54,860
But we have to be aware of what's floating around out there, and what our kids have access to.

1798
02:08:54,860 --> 02:09:01,860
Bump Fights is a rather grim series of films designed to exploit homeless people by making them participate in often quite dangerous antics,

1799
02:09:01,860 --> 02:09:05,860
and so it made sense that they would be subject to criticism from someone like McGraw,

1800
02:09:05,860 --> 02:09:09,860
who would obviously find such content abhorrent on the grounds of its inhumanity.

1801
02:09:09,860 --> 02:09:13,860
This seemed like the perfect opportunity to pick someone apart for their actions.

1802
02:09:13,860 --> 02:09:14,860
And yet...

1803
02:09:14,860 --> 02:09:18,860
I've made multi-millions off the Bump Fights video series.

1804
02:09:18,860 --> 02:09:21,860
I'm not surprised at my success. It's a sick world.

1805
02:09:21,860 --> 02:09:24,860
Stop the tape. Stop the tape.

1806
02:09:24,860 --> 02:09:26,860
I don't want to talk to you.

1807
02:09:26,860 --> 02:09:27,860
Why not?

1808
02:09:27,860 --> 02:09:30,860
That's despicable. I don't want to talk to you.

1809
02:09:30,860 --> 02:09:37,860
I just watched that footage, and that is absolutely despicable, and I refuse to publicise that.

1810
02:09:37,860 --> 02:09:44,860
In the moment, it seemed that McGraw, so roused by the content he watched, had made an active decision to not indulge this heartless troll,

1811
02:09:44,860 --> 02:09:47,860
a harrowing moment of principle from the Doctor himself.

1812
02:09:47,860 --> 02:09:53,860
He creates this stance, as it's a matter that is clearly very personal to him, as he said he has been homeless too.

1813
02:09:53,860 --> 02:09:56,860
Yet, he's interviewed worse people, hasn't he?

1814
02:09:56,860 --> 02:09:59,860
I mean, what is so exceptional about this guy?

1815
02:10:00,860 --> 02:10:07,860
If you think I exploit people, every time you bring a guest on this show, you exploit them and spread whatever problems they have to the whole world.

1816
02:10:07,860 --> 02:10:09,860
You think that's helping them?

1817
02:10:09,860 --> 02:10:11,860
Yeah, keep telling yourself that. You can go.

1818
02:10:11,860 --> 02:10:14,860
Ah well, you see, he's dressed in rather interesting attire.

1819
02:10:14,860 --> 02:10:18,860
You could go as far as to say him and Dr. Phil, but practically matching suits.

1820
02:10:18,860 --> 02:10:21,860
As that clip just illustrated, it wasn't done without purpose.

1821
02:10:21,860 --> 02:10:27,860
As a matter of fact, it seems Beeson wanted to take the opportunity to make a you and I ain't so different type speech.

1822
02:10:27,860 --> 02:10:31,860
Now, I would say that Bum Fights is somewhat worse than Dr. Phil on the basis of its premise,

1823
02:10:31,860 --> 02:10:34,860
and I think McGraw could have made that case for himself,

1824
02:10:34,860 --> 02:10:39,860
but clearly anticipating that it's an argument he does not want to have, he pulls the plug on the interview.

1825
02:10:39,860 --> 02:10:42,860
Now, this isn't exactly an admission that Beeson is in fact correct,

1826
02:10:42,860 --> 02:10:47,860
but for a man who is so sure-footed on the narratives he propounds and the judgments he makes on other people,

1827
02:10:47,860 --> 02:10:49,860
you'd think he'd be at least able to stand up for himself,

1828
02:10:49,860 --> 02:10:54,860
and yet he can't even answer to the creator or one of the most philistine forms of modern media.

1829
02:10:54,860 --> 02:10:59,860
If it truly was a matter that caused McGraw to feel so strongly to the point where he didn't want to give this guy the time of day,

1830
02:10:59,860 --> 02:11:01,860
he shouldn't have let him on the show in the first place.

1831
02:11:01,860 --> 02:11:07,860
Dismissing the guy when he was actively there before he could even say anything was probably the most cowardly thing to do.

1832
02:11:07,860 --> 02:11:12,860
Phil saw this guy coming and realised it wasn't going to be your usual dunking.

1833
02:11:12,860 --> 02:11:16,860
If it was truly about the people that Dr. Phil sought to help or address,

1834
02:11:16,860 --> 02:11:20,860
he would have no reservations going toe to toe with some of the most questionable figures in modern culture,

1835
02:11:21,860 --> 02:11:23,860
like a lot of the old talk show hosts from the 60s.

1836
02:11:23,860 --> 02:11:29,860
But it's always a question of control for McGraw, and they can't afford an episode which even makes him look remotely out of his depth.

1837
02:11:29,860 --> 02:11:36,860
There has to be a predictability about how these guests are going to behave so that McGraw can assert control over the situation,

1838
02:11:36,860 --> 02:11:39,860
so that if they concur with him, they're engaging positively with his narrative,

1839
02:11:39,860 --> 02:11:44,860
or if they are so bold to try and detract from them, the show has a way to discredit what they say,

1840
02:11:44,860 --> 02:11:47,860
whether they're young, intoxicated, or just mentally unstable.

1841
02:11:47,860 --> 02:11:51,860
The last part I requested more humanity, but humanity is a two-way street,

1842
02:11:51,860 --> 02:11:56,860
and to require more humanity from the show would require more humanity from Dr. Phil,

1843
02:11:56,860 --> 02:12:02,860
and I think it's just too much to ask from a show that has prided itself on having a superhuman host.

1844
02:12:02,860 --> 02:12:04,860
After all, he's just a little sensitive.

1845
02:12:05,860 --> 02:12:10,860
It's the love story of the century, but you've never physically met.

1846
02:12:10,860 --> 02:12:15,860
No, sir. And y'all can laugh at me. Fine. I will be your spectacle. I will be your laughing, laughing spectacle.

1847
02:12:15,860 --> 02:12:16,860
You can all laugh at me. It's fine.

1848
02:12:16,860 --> 02:12:18,860
Well, you know what? I think we're just going to shut this down,

1849
02:12:18,860 --> 02:12:23,860
because I'm not into all this melodrama and you playing the victim and everything,

1850
02:12:23,860 --> 02:12:28,860
so you're saying the audience is making a spectacle out of you.

1851
02:12:28,860 --> 02:12:30,860
That's not what I'm about. That's not what I do.

1852
02:12:30,860 --> 02:12:36,860
I had you come here to help you, and you're saying people are ridiculed, making fun of you,

1853
02:12:36,860 --> 02:12:39,860
you're going to be a spectacle. I don't want to be any part of that.

1854
02:12:39,860 --> 02:12:42,860
I used the word Messiah earlier, and I 100% meant it.

1855
02:12:42,860 --> 02:12:48,860
Dr. Phil's show is structured off making the title character seem like that savior at any and all costs,

1856
02:12:48,860 --> 02:12:53,860
that he is right, but the truth is that nobody, not even a therapist, can fulfill that image,

1857
02:12:53,860 --> 02:12:57,860
and any show that provides that impression is not being honest with its guests or its audience.

1858
02:12:57,860 --> 02:12:59,860
The problem is that when you successfully sell that image,

1859
02:12:59,860 --> 02:13:04,860
not only are you selling an unrealistic expectation of therapy to millions of people,

1860
02:13:04,860 --> 02:13:08,860
you aren't creating a fair environment for a struggling guest to actually find the support they need.

1861
02:13:08,860 --> 02:13:13,860
It means that any actual treatment doesn't have to be catered to the individual, more to a show's agenda,

1862
02:13:13,860 --> 02:13:18,860
and if it doesn't work, you can push responsibility onto the guests for not being receptive enough.

1863
02:13:18,860 --> 02:13:21,860
It's the Seymour Skinner complex that asks you whether your form of therapy didn't work,

1864
02:13:21,860 --> 02:13:24,860
and then concluding that it must be the patient who's wrong.

1865
02:13:24,860 --> 02:13:29,860
It's built off this idea purported to audiences that it's Dr. Phil offering a service to these people,

1866
02:13:29,860 --> 02:13:32,860
when in reality, it's quite the opposite.

1867
02:13:32,860 --> 02:13:35,860
This has just gone in a really bad direction.

1868
02:13:35,860 --> 02:13:38,860
I'm going to talk with Jasmine, I'm going to talk with your mother,

1869
02:13:38,860 --> 02:13:44,860
and I'm just going to let you head on home and go, because I'm not going to play-

1870
02:13:44,860 --> 02:13:47,860
Is there anything I can say to fix this? I'm so sorry.

1871
02:13:47,860 --> 02:13:52,860
No, no, all of this melodrama about ridiculing the audience and they can laugh at you and all that,

1872
02:13:52,860 --> 02:13:59,860
I don't play those kind of games. You're very manipulative, and I just, I'm not interested in all of that.

1873
02:13:59,860 --> 02:14:03,860
Although there would be no show without cameras, and no narrative without the producers,

1874
02:14:03,860 --> 02:14:06,860
there would be no Dr. Phil without the guests.

1875
02:14:06,860 --> 02:14:11,860
They provide the show with years of timeless stories, and harrowing accounts, receiving very little from it in return.

1876
02:14:11,860 --> 02:14:17,860
Their benefit, the hope for recovery, which really should be provided regardless of financial incentive,

1877
02:14:17,860 --> 02:14:20,860
is the least they deserved, and sometimes that wasn't even viable.

1878
02:14:20,860 --> 02:14:24,860
There are so many people, famous celebrities, enshrined through the lens of modern media,

1879
02:14:24,860 --> 02:14:29,860
who could be picked out at their weakest point, and put under that Dr. Phil microscope,

1880
02:14:29,860 --> 02:14:33,860
and the man himself is no exception.

1881
02:14:42,860 --> 02:14:47,860
Cancel culture, it's a phrase that's been used in online circles to nauseating degrees.

1882
02:14:47,860 --> 02:14:50,860
I don't want to go too much into detail about it right now,

1883
02:14:50,860 --> 02:14:55,860
but it's difficult to even give a basic rundown of the definition because there are so many interpretations of it,

1884
02:14:55,860 --> 02:14:58,860
to the point where some people don't even believe it exists.

1885
02:14:58,860 --> 02:15:03,860
I think mainly because this sphere of discussion is dominated by super celebrities who are almost immune

1886
02:15:03,860 --> 02:15:05,860
to ever having their voices silenced anyway.

1887
02:15:05,860 --> 02:15:10,860
However, our good friend Dr. Phil McGraw has been an outspoken critic of it,

1888
02:15:10,860 --> 02:15:13,860
appearing on interviews to call out the harmfulness of the culture,

1889
02:15:13,860 --> 02:15:17,860
but speaking is one thing, does his show reflect that philosophy?

1890
02:15:17,860 --> 02:15:20,860
Well, to many, cancel culture seems like a new phenomenon,

1891
02:15:20,860 --> 02:15:24,860
and the presence of mob mentality online definitely highlights his failings,

1892
02:15:24,860 --> 02:15:28,860
but in many cases, I think it's just a repackaging of something that's long existed,

1893
02:15:28,860 --> 02:15:31,860
and it's not something that affects everybody equally.

1894
02:15:31,860 --> 02:15:36,860
We are in a bubble, we don't want to talk to anyone that doesn't agree with our thinking,

1895
02:15:36,860 --> 02:15:42,860
and if someone says something that is offensive to our sensibilities, then people go on the attack,

1896
02:15:42,860 --> 02:15:49,860
and they may choose a wrong word, and instead of saying, you know, maybe messaging them in some way,

1897
02:15:49,860 --> 02:15:54,860
saying, hey listen, you may not know it, but that could be offensive to someone,

1898
02:15:54,860 --> 02:16:00,860
instead they start bombarding them with boycott messages telling them they hope they die,

1899
02:16:00,860 --> 02:16:05,860
I'm going to slit your throat in the night, I hate, I mean just horrible things.

1900
02:16:05,860 --> 02:16:09,860
In 1988, when McGraw was actually working as a psychologist,

1901
02:16:09,860 --> 02:16:14,860
he was reprimanded and penalised for hiring a former patient of his for part-time employment.

1902
02:16:14,860 --> 02:16:18,860
The patient in question also made claims suggesting inappropriate contact by McGraw,

1903
02:16:18,860 --> 02:16:22,860
however, the board's review did not conclude in the patient's favour on that front.

1904
02:16:22,860 --> 02:16:26,860
For now, I'm not going to comment on that which is disputed, and there are other serious claims against him

1905
02:16:26,860 --> 02:16:29,860
that are tied up in legal proceedings which I won't be exploring today,

1906
02:16:29,860 --> 02:16:35,860
however, I will say that it is Therapy 101 that you do not develop a personal or business relationship

1907
02:16:35,860 --> 02:16:37,860
with one of your patients outside of your practice.

1908
02:16:37,860 --> 02:16:42,860
It's not a healthy dynamic, and the fact that someone seemingly as stoic as McGraw could allow that to happen

1909
02:16:42,860 --> 02:16:46,860
is certainly a stark reminder that TV hosts are not all they represent sometimes.

1910
02:16:46,860 --> 02:16:52,860
Now, that's over 30 years ago, and I think one of the uglier aspects of cancer culture is ruining someone's career

1911
02:16:52,860 --> 02:16:57,860
for historic indiscretions. I believe that broadly speaking, people deserve the chance to grow and change,

1912
02:16:57,860 --> 02:17:00,860
and that ruining someone's livelihood is seldom the solution.

1913
02:17:00,860 --> 02:17:06,860
In his case, the board's solution was for McGraw to be supervised until they were satisfied that their conditions were met.

1914
02:17:06,860 --> 02:17:10,860
To many, this would seem like a fair and proportional response from the board. Would Dr. Phil agree?

1915
02:17:10,860 --> 02:17:17,860
McGraw has been outspoken on the benefits of his show, and even that he believes it's a fair basis for conflict resolution.

1916
02:17:17,860 --> 02:17:21,860
So all I'd ask is this, if McGraw genuinely believes in his own approach to therapy,

1917
02:17:21,860 --> 02:17:27,860
would he have subjected himself to it when he found himself facing serious criticism in 1988?

1918
02:17:27,860 --> 02:17:31,860
Although I can't look inside his mind, my prediction would be a resounding no.

1919
02:17:31,860 --> 02:17:37,860
Why? Because he knows better than anyone that you have very little control over how you're going to be perceived or presented.

1920
02:17:37,860 --> 02:17:43,860
Dr. Phil emphasizes responsibility, but when you as a person have no control over what the TV producers do,

1921
02:17:43,860 --> 02:17:49,860
what Dr. Phil says, or how your own words may even be twisted and used against you, you can't be responsible for that,

1922
02:17:49,860 --> 02:17:53,860
yet you'll believe it because you were the person who chose to go on the show in the first place.

1923
02:17:53,860 --> 02:17:57,860
Audiences can pretend to be better, but if the performance of YouTube videos tell us anything,

1924
02:17:57,860 --> 02:18:01,860
it's that people are much more interested in the deterioration than they are the recovery.

1925
02:18:01,860 --> 02:18:05,860
People are going to be remembered online for decades for often their lowest points in their life,

1926
02:18:05,860 --> 02:18:11,860
will likely be judged for behaviour they may have long corrected, even though in hindsight, the flaws of these shows seemed abundantly clear.

1927
02:18:11,860 --> 02:18:15,860
Most of the longest running shows in this genre, like Springer, Carl, and even Jones,

1928
02:18:15,860 --> 02:18:17,860
were often the most provocative and controversial.

1929
02:18:17,860 --> 02:18:22,860
Many of them were rather gross, relied on stereotypes and tropes related to people's backgrounds or identity,

1930
02:18:22,860 --> 02:18:28,860
and if the same formula was applied with more subtlety with Dr. Phil, it would hardly be surprising as it seems inbuilt with the genre.

1931
02:18:28,860 --> 02:18:34,860
Even beyond the concept alone, the numerous allegations that Dr. Phil producers went out of their way to make people seem worse

1932
02:18:34,860 --> 02:18:40,860
than they actually were on screen, isn't that the core of said culture that McGraw would decry in interviews?

1933
02:18:40,860 --> 02:18:45,860
You see, although I think in many ways, provocative hosts were likely detrimental to guests during their TV appearances,

1934
02:18:45,860 --> 02:18:50,860
it at least gave audiences some idea of how responsibility can be shared in these situations.

1935
02:18:50,860 --> 02:18:56,860
I don't think most people are emotionally unintelligent, I think they can recognise when a frenzied situation arises,

1936
02:18:56,860 --> 02:19:01,860
and it's hard to control. Dr. Phil, on the other hand, built up Randolph being the reasonable guy,

1937
02:19:01,860 --> 02:19:05,860
and it's ingenious optics really, because I think in appearing measured and reasonable,

1938
02:19:05,860 --> 02:19:10,860
he succeeds in making his guests, who are often put on the spot, look much rather like the opposite,

1939
02:19:10,860 --> 02:19:15,860
and if the allegations are true, then in many ways, they were much more insidious in their technique than many other hosts

1940
02:19:15,860 --> 02:19:18,860
who were outwardly, on the surface, more objectionable.

1941
02:19:18,860 --> 02:19:24,860
Everyone looks at social media as the sole cause of cancellation, but TV has been cancelling people for decades,

1942
02:19:24,860 --> 02:19:29,860
whether that be their social standing amongst their peers, or the lives that have been lost due to it.

1943
02:19:29,860 --> 02:19:36,860
It's happened to high profile people who have been forgotten, and low profile people who as far as most of us know, never existed.

1944
02:19:36,860 --> 02:19:41,860
The internet certainly amplifies elements of it, and it's not healthy, but a lot of people have been looking down

1945
02:19:41,860 --> 02:19:46,860
on these people struggling before the internet ever began to have any sort of influence in these people's lives.

1946
02:19:46,860 --> 02:19:51,860
The only way you can come out a winner in the eyes of the audience is if you cooperate with a show's narrative,

1947
02:19:51,860 --> 02:19:55,860
and let the help they offer change you for the better, places like Turnabout.

1948
02:19:55,860 --> 02:19:58,860
It's not authentic though, and some people will fall at that hurdle.

1949
02:19:58,860 --> 02:20:04,860
It's not their fault that an aggressive form of therapy wasn't for them, but the show will sure make it seem like it.

1950
02:20:04,860 --> 02:20:11,860
Framing is everything, we live in an era where people seem to empathise more with fictional characters than real people because of it.

1951
02:20:11,860 --> 02:20:17,860
TV series like Barry or Better Call Saul are far superior psychological analyses of complex characters,

1952
02:20:17,860 --> 02:20:22,860
and sure, it's hard to find people like that for a tabloid talk show, and you might not want to,

1953
02:20:22,860 --> 02:20:28,860
but when there are shows that contextualise mass murderers and the literal devil better than you can a drug addicted teen,

1954
02:20:28,860 --> 02:20:31,860
then maybe you're doing something wrong, and once these people are off your show,

1955
02:20:31,860 --> 02:20:37,860
they can do very little to change that image in an industry that favours large companies with lawyers on retainer.

1956
02:20:37,860 --> 02:20:39,860
Everyone's an actor when they know a camera's on.

1957
02:20:40,860 --> 02:20:41,860
Daily, how are you?

1958
02:20:41,860 --> 02:20:42,860
Um, not good.

1959
02:20:42,860 --> 02:20:43,860
Yeah, why's that?

1960
02:20:43,860 --> 02:20:47,860
I was told that y'all brought someone here that I explicitly said not to bring.

1961
02:20:47,860 --> 02:20:48,860
Yeah, who's that?

1962
02:20:48,860 --> 02:20:50,860
Um, my biological mother.

1963
02:20:50,860 --> 02:20:51,860
Would you like to leave?

1964
02:20:51,860 --> 02:20:52,860
Um.

1965
02:20:52,860 --> 02:20:58,860
Cause you can certainly leave, cause nobody tells me who to put on my show, including you.

1966
02:20:58,860 --> 02:20:59,860
Times are changing though.

1967
02:20:59,860 --> 02:21:04,860
You're on the beaten days where you'd be thrown off or torn apart if you had anything to say against McGraw.

1968
02:21:04,860 --> 02:21:10,860
People who have been subject to grilling on these shows find themselves with a greater platform to finally express their own perspectives,

1969
02:21:10,860 --> 02:21:14,860
ones that would never have been broadcast elsewhere because they didn't fit the narrative.

1970
02:21:14,860 --> 02:21:17,860
People like Bregoli, whose case would have otherwise been lost to the sands of time,

1971
02:21:17,860 --> 02:21:23,860
have been able to use their former notoriety to actually amplify their own voice in discussing their experience on the show,

1972
02:21:23,860 --> 02:21:25,860
and the subsequent treatment they were subjected to.

1973
02:21:25,860 --> 02:21:27,860
Someone like Commentators followed suit.

1974
02:21:27,860 --> 02:21:31,860
YouTuber Jaco has released a very compelling set of videos covering many of these scandals,

1975
02:21:31,860 --> 02:21:35,860
which I definitely recommend, with further strong contributions coming from many corners of the internet.

1976
02:21:35,860 --> 02:21:40,860
It's very valiant for Dr. Phil to start discussing cancel culture now in the way that he has,

1977
02:21:40,860 --> 02:21:46,860
but one can't help thinking where this discussion was when he was publicly roasting parents for not raising children

1978
02:21:46,860 --> 02:21:50,860
as he thought they should in front of millions of viewers, and roasting those children too.

1979
02:21:50,860 --> 02:21:56,860
I don't know what he thinks is so different about the online world that makes his core specifically so righteous.

1980
02:21:56,860 --> 02:22:04,860
Well, guys, it's time for you each to take responsibility for what part of this you own,

1981
02:22:04,860 --> 02:22:12,860
and Diane, you're blaming Ron, and Ron, you're blaming Diane, but let me assure you, nobody,

1982
02:22:12,860 --> 02:22:18,860
nobody is responsible for your feelings and your actions but yourself.

1983
02:22:18,860 --> 02:22:24,860
It's ironic, what could prove to be the Achilles heel of Dr. Phil may be the very responsibility

1984
02:22:24,860 --> 02:22:30,860
that McGraw has continuously advocated for. Once again, one can't help wonder what he would say to himself now

1985
02:22:30,860 --> 02:22:34,860
if he was a guest on his own show, so I guess I'll say it to him.

1986
02:22:34,860 --> 02:22:40,860
Yes, cancel culture is real and can genuinely harm decent people trying to better themselves,

1987
02:22:40,860 --> 02:22:46,860
I'm glad you care about it, but it's a culture that everyone, yourself included, has participated in at some point in their lives.

1988
02:22:46,860 --> 02:22:52,860
Suddenly taking an interest when people have become capable of calling you out seems a bit too coincidental.

1989
02:22:52,860 --> 02:22:57,860
I know it's a trending topic right now, and obviously the phrase has helped amplify the discussion surrounding it,

1990
02:22:57,860 --> 02:23:02,860
but most of Phil's discourse centres around people who clearly haven't been cancelled, alongside interviews with pop culture

1991
02:23:02,860 --> 02:23:06,860
and political loudmouths who use these narratives to actually increase their influence.

1992
02:23:06,860 --> 02:23:14,860
I can't believe how my fellow liberals are behaving, what is liberal about cancelling everybody and anything

1993
02:23:14,860 --> 02:23:17,860
that you don't happen to agree with? It's a complete nonsense.

1994
02:23:17,860 --> 02:23:21,860
Listen, there's been attempts to cancel me before cancel culture was a thing.

1995
02:23:21,860 --> 02:23:24,860
I'm an outspoken conservative, that's something that I'm used to.

1996
02:23:24,860 --> 02:23:29,860
A lot of large celebrities seem to conflate ordinary people having a platform to respond to them,

1997
02:23:29,860 --> 02:23:36,860
maybe sometimes rather unpleasantly, with actual threats to their careers, when in many cases they'll never experience that.

1998
02:23:36,860 --> 02:23:41,860
There are examples where shows and institutes have been pressured to drop certain public figures,

1999
02:23:41,860 --> 02:23:44,860
and those reasons have been tenuous or driven by personal vendettas.

2000
02:23:45,860 --> 02:23:51,860
I have never agreed with that, and I am broadly a free speech person, but even then it seldom targets celebrities,

2001
02:23:51,860 --> 02:23:55,860
often academics, smaller companies, those who can't actually afford to fight for themselves.

2002
02:23:55,860 --> 02:24:00,860
Dr Phil can, it's clear that he has, and it's clear that he will continue to.

2003
02:24:00,860 --> 02:24:05,860
However, his takes on cancel culture aren't those of a psychologist, they're those of someone who simply

2004
02:24:05,860 --> 02:24:10,860
isn't as untouchable as they previously were, but sometimes that is for the best.

2005
02:24:10,860 --> 02:24:16,860
Just like the psychology board's verdict, in 1988 wasn't cancel culture, neither is this.

2006
02:24:22,860 --> 02:24:27,860
At the start of the video, I posed a simple question that was likely being asked by many ambitious producers

2007
02:24:27,860 --> 02:24:29,860
at the time of Dr Phil's first appearance on TV.

2008
02:24:29,860 --> 02:24:35,860
If we combine a talk show host with a specialist in a specific academic area, what would the result be?

2009
02:24:35,860 --> 02:24:40,860
Well, obviously, Dr Phil is only one possible outcome, but from this one little case study,

2010
02:24:40,860 --> 02:24:45,860
I'd say that it yielded an impressive, yet hollow spectacle, one that flaunted all the credentials

2011
02:24:45,860 --> 02:24:50,860
of our servant in question, but had no way to effectively utilize it in a format that maintained a balance

2012
02:24:50,860 --> 02:24:55,860
between entertainment and humanity, instead leaning into the former at the expense of the latter,

2013
02:24:55,860 --> 02:24:59,860
in pursuit of those ratings, but I suppose that's not necessarily a surprise.

2014
02:24:59,860 --> 02:25:04,860
It's what these studios know best, and anything that may allow the competition to have an edge over them

2015
02:25:04,860 --> 02:25:08,860
should be considered as fair game. It's the survival of the fittest environment,

2016
02:25:08,860 --> 02:25:12,860
and it's what keeps a lot of people in their jobs, however, just because it's the natural thing to do,

2017
02:25:12,860 --> 02:25:16,860
it's the right thing to do, and over time, as people's moral compasses have adjusted,

2018
02:25:16,860 --> 02:25:20,860
the format of Dr Phil has become unpalatable with more and more viewers.

2019
02:25:20,860 --> 02:25:25,860
Combined with some allegations that completely contradict the image that Dr Phil would claim to reject,

2020
02:25:25,860 --> 02:25:28,860
and the continued poor responses made by employees and even McGraw himself,

2021
02:25:28,860 --> 02:25:32,860
it's not a surprise that some people are switching off, or switching over.

2022
02:25:32,860 --> 02:25:37,860
Dr Phil taught many how to sympathize with those struggling, but now people are working out how to empathize with them as well.

2023
02:25:37,860 --> 02:25:42,860
Dr Phil taught many how to seek out help, but now many are learning that there are different types of help,

2024
02:25:42,860 --> 02:25:49,860
and that there's never a one-size-fits-all solution. In both cases, it makes Dr Phil's approach seem a little outdated.

2025
02:25:49,860 --> 02:25:53,860
People's understanding of mental health has evolved greatly in the last couple decades, and I'm glad.

2026
02:25:53,860 --> 02:25:57,860
We're garnering a greater understanding of the challenges and troubles that people face.

2027
02:25:57,860 --> 02:26:03,860
Although we still have a long way to go, I think many have begun to understand how public therapy is a bit of an oxymoron.

2028
02:26:03,860 --> 02:26:09,860
It's a difficult topic to navigate, and Dr Phil has likely put a fair few conversations surrounding mental health on the map.

2029
02:26:09,860 --> 02:26:12,860
I don't want to void him of any credit whatsoever.

2030
02:26:12,860 --> 02:26:16,860
We want to live in a world where these topics aren't too difficult to address and pay attention to,

2031
02:26:16,860 --> 02:26:21,860
but we also need to make sure that those people who may be the centre of the discourse can at least represent themselves how they wish to,

2032
02:26:21,860 --> 02:26:26,860
free of narratives that wish to box them in or present a third party as the hero of the situation.

2033
02:26:26,860 --> 02:26:31,860
Dr Phil didn't steal the limelight completely for himself, but it's natural for a TV show to bolster their reputation

2034
02:26:31,860 --> 02:26:35,860
by crediting themselves for the positive stories and outcomes of guests who have appeared on there,

2035
02:26:35,860 --> 02:26:41,860
people saying thank you Dr Phil, and viewers clapping while he strolls around because it's just another day at the office for him,

2036
02:26:41,860 --> 02:26:46,860
and I think the contrast of blaming the guests when something doesn't work out creates a very unsavoury juxtaposition.

2037
02:26:46,860 --> 02:26:52,860
Although there are lots of people and factors that can aid a person's recovery, it's you who has made those changes,

2038
02:26:52,860 --> 02:26:55,860
and you should never let anyone take that credit away from you.

2039
02:26:55,860 --> 02:27:01,860
It's not easy, it's a minefield of shit to navigate that may occasionally challenge you to confront bad habits,

2040
02:27:01,860 --> 02:27:07,860
but even if it's entirely your fault that you landed yourself in shit in the first place and you're merely going back to where you started from,

2041
02:27:07,860 --> 02:27:09,860
it's still worthy of recognition.

2042
02:27:09,860 --> 02:27:15,860
Although it's not the entire story, I do think that to make stories more centred around the people who are actually encountering these struggles,

2043
02:27:15,860 --> 02:27:21,860
you have to decentralise the system that covers these stories, and that's antithetical to the nature of a talk show.

2044
02:27:21,860 --> 02:27:29,860
That's why I think Dr Phil is probably too rigid to make that change, because they'd probably have to scrap the one thing that appealed to audiences in the first place,

2045
02:27:29,860 --> 02:27:37,860
Dr Phil himself. He's a knowledgeable and intelligent individual, but he's part of a system that has fallen behind what a lot of people are looking for,

2046
02:27:37,860 --> 02:27:44,860
and how long he can retain his viewership amongst a manifestation of claims and lawsuits that seem to have greater media presence than ever

2047
02:27:44,860 --> 02:27:46,860
is a question that will only be revealed with time.

2048
02:27:46,860 --> 02:27:53,860
Maybe if Dr Phil does come to an end, we will have some clarity on what happened behind the scenes from people who no longer have a commitment to the show,

2049
02:27:53,860 --> 02:27:55,860
but who knows when that's going to happen.

2050
02:27:55,860 --> 02:28:02,860
It's unclear what the future of the Dr Phil show has in store, but whether it continues for another 20 years or isn't renewed past 2023,

2051
02:28:02,860 --> 02:28:08,860
it's legacy is definitely going to be the source of debate for time to come. However, there are some judgements that can be made.

2052
02:28:08,860 --> 02:28:14,860
At its best, the producers of Dr Phil didn't properly make sure their guests stayed in a safe place as they should have,

2053
02:28:14,860 --> 02:28:20,860
and at their worst, they could have exposed guests to the very vices they were claiming to remedy, very possibly intentionally.

2054
02:28:20,860 --> 02:28:25,860
Now, in most cases, Dr Phil did provide care for people after their appearance, though there are obvious exceptions.

2055
02:28:25,860 --> 02:28:30,860
However, is the help that comes after worth the humiliation and conflict that comes during?

2056
02:28:30,860 --> 02:28:35,860
It's a question worth asking, particularly when that help was structured around its own business model,

2057
02:28:35,860 --> 02:28:43,860
whether that meant shipping celebrities off to facilities and specific places, or sending children to boarding schools or treatment centres in different states.

2058
02:28:44,860 --> 02:28:55,860
Well, it's hard to believe that 21 years ago I made my very first appearance on the Oprah show, and together we launched Dr Phil in 2002.

2059
02:28:55,860 --> 02:29:00,860
And it does sadden me in a way, because in watching a lot of episodes, I have seen the positive changes made by the show.

2060
02:29:00,860 --> 02:29:07,860
I have seen people genuinely find the help they need, I have seen some really harrowing interviews with people who have been through hell.

2061
02:29:07,860 --> 02:29:11,860
Dr Phil isn't this universal negative, and I don't want to make it out to be that,

2062
02:29:11,860 --> 02:29:15,860
but it is a product of an era that isn't as human as it needs to be.

2063
02:29:15,860 --> 02:29:20,860
I said at the start that as preached on the show, the first step to making a change in your life is acknowledging responsibility,

2064
02:29:20,860 --> 02:29:27,860
something that many of us have done, but something that many of these shows seem to be allergic to, possibly for legal reasons, I don't know for sure.

2065
02:29:27,860 --> 02:29:34,860
Maybe for that reason, they'll never evolve, but I do want to give some words of advice in the instance that that is something they're interested in.

2066
02:29:34,860 --> 02:29:39,860
If it wants to at least try and keep up with the changing zeitgeist, there needs to be changes.

2067
02:29:39,860 --> 02:29:46,860
This isn't 2002 anymore, there should be more diligence about how guests are treated on and off the show, and how the show presents their stories.

2068
02:29:46,860 --> 02:29:52,860
They shouldn't let guests put themselves at risk with substances and alcohol in their care, regardless of the TV that it may engender.

2069
02:29:52,860 --> 02:29:56,860
They shouldn't crucify teens and youngsters because they're behaving badly.

2070
02:29:56,860 --> 02:30:01,860
If they want to make a positive difference, put some money aside towards their treatment, and protect their identities a little better.

2071
02:30:02,860 --> 02:30:10,860
They're troubled as anyone, and crafting narratives about how they're the offspring from hell only boxes in their image and challenges them to rebel at one of the most rebellious points in their lives.

2072
02:30:10,860 --> 02:30:15,860
How they can think that helps is beyond me, and it's definitely something that needs to change in my opinion.

2073
02:30:15,860 --> 02:30:18,860
Whether they choose to take that advice is their decision.

2074
02:30:18,860 --> 02:30:22,860
I'm sure McGraw and all will be living alright either way if their net worth is anything to go by,

2075
02:30:22,860 --> 02:30:27,860
but if they also care about the wellbeing of their guests, it might just be worth considering.

2076
02:30:27,860 --> 02:30:31,860
Doctor Phil McGraw, and all those behind Doctor Phil, did something unprecedented.

2077
02:30:31,860 --> 02:30:37,860
They took tabloid talk shows to the next level, and showed many in the genre that there could be a more dignified element,

2078
02:30:37,860 --> 02:30:41,860
but not every episode had to end with some sort of route.

2079
02:30:41,860 --> 02:30:48,860
However, by holding on to some of the more tabloid aspects of the original formula, they eventually fell into the same pitfalls that many other shows of their time had.

2080
02:30:48,860 --> 02:30:56,860
Where they'll be remembered for those pitfalls, or their success stories, is something only time will tell, and maybe they still have time to change that.

2081
02:30:56,860 --> 02:31:02,860
But it's something whose extent we'll probably only fully know when Doctor Phil is cancelled.

2082
02:31:02,860 --> 02:31:08,860
The show that is, not the person. You know, that was the pun. I'm really funny.

2083
02:31:14,860 --> 02:31:22,860
So yeah, that was the video. Hope you enjoyed. Took a bit to come together, but did come together in the end, and that's what matters.

2084
02:31:23,860 --> 02:31:31,860
Not too much to discuss today, but I did want to mention one thing. Currently, we're doing a little charity thing on the merchandise website.

2085
02:31:31,860 --> 02:31:37,860
Selling some items. Obviously, Christmas is a lovely time for a lot of people, but not for everyone.

2086
02:31:37,860 --> 02:31:41,860
My mother put some nice designs together, and we thought, why not?

2087
02:31:41,860 --> 02:31:48,860
So with some of these charity jobs, obviously there is the concern that others are taking a cut, and obviously there are costs for the production of the shirts.

2088
02:31:48,860 --> 02:31:55,860
What I'm going to do is donate the difference, so that how much you pay for the products is how much is being donated.

2089
02:31:55,860 --> 02:32:00,860
And you get something for it as well, which may have some utility in your life.

2090
02:32:00,860 --> 02:32:07,860
It's better than buying the new lad baby single. And for the Americans who do not understand their reference, ignorance is bliss, my friends.

2091
02:32:07,860 --> 02:32:09,860
Ignorance is bliss.

2092
02:32:09,860 --> 02:32:16,860
I'd also like to thank the editors. Credits will be in the pinned comment below. I said description last time, I'm not sure why.

2093
02:32:16,860 --> 02:32:24,860
I had a bit of a moment. I also need to give a big thanks to the patrons, $10 patrons on screen right now.

Thanks to vidIQ for sponsoring the video, it was genuinely great to work with them as I did use their app as a smaller creator.
