00:00.000 --> 00:18.420
Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time.

00:18.420 --> 00:24.680
A mainstream TV, a contraption that, contrary to release held by many netizens, people do actually still watch.

00:24.680 --> 00:31.040
Sharks, advanced sports technology is at the forefront of a new sport that's sweeping the entire nation like a tidal wave.

00:31.040 --> 00:35.640
Sharks, this is the National Association of Bubble Soccer.

00:35.640 --> 00:50.040
It's not a necessity in modern day society, with the rise of online content and streaming platforms,

00:50.040 --> 00:53.160
you can obtain your daily dose of entertainment from a variety of sources.

00:53.160 --> 00:57.880
Yet, although audiences have certainly been spoiled with an abundance of TV series and films,

00:57.880 --> 01:03.280
many live shows have still predominantly remained on broadcast television, well, at least more than others.

01:03.280 --> 01:10.120
These include game shows, news programs, and of course, today's genre that has launched so many successful careers, talk shows.

01:24.040 --> 01:30.680
Now, this isn't to say they don't have their online counterparts, but I think like other shows that retain most of their audience from live TV broadcast,

01:30.680 --> 01:38.320
there is something about watching that sort of content in the moment, as it often operates within a very brief window into the spirit of that specific era.

01:38.320 --> 01:44.120
If you went back and tried to watch an episode of Oprah from 1992, you'd probably find it hasn't dated the best.

01:44.120 --> 01:47.360
I mean, sometimes these episodes are dated by the time they're released.

01:53.160 --> 02:00.400
I digress though, to give them their credit, they have fought hard for their place on the TV Guide,

02:00.400 --> 02:07.520
and they do provide people with content that can keep them in touch with the world around them through a medium that may be more digestible than the traditional outlets.

02:07.520 --> 02:11.400
With this in mind, there aren't too many set rules for creating a successful talk show.

02:11.400 --> 02:16.560
The first rule is that there needs to be some talking, that kind of goes without saying, or with saying I suppose,

02:16.560 --> 02:22.520
but it's also important that the person talking is relatively interesting, and has a personality to present those viewing.

02:22.520 --> 02:28.040
The second rule is that there needs to be people to talk to, otherwise the host is just rambling into the void.

02:28.040 --> 02:36.280
Therefore, they'll either talk to you, the viewer, directly, or there's a live audience drafted into cheer, jeer, or appear as part of the host's wacky shenanigans.

02:36.280 --> 02:45.920
With such a broad church of TV encompassed by these couple tenets, it's no surprise that a plethora of shows have garnered success of the very diverse interpretations of these couple key tenets,

02:45.920 --> 02:51.480
from the preppy positivity of Ellen, to the necessary conflict and consequent chaos of a show like The View.

02:51.480 --> 02:55.960
We just said we don't scream at each other, right? Or is it just you that gets to scream?

02:55.960 --> 02:56.960
Okay, no, no, I agree.

02:56.960 --> 03:04.160
Okay, then lower your voice, because we are very close to each other, and I know you come here to sell a book and try to pick a fight, but we're not going to do it today.

03:04.160 --> 03:11.600
Nevertheless, it follows that such a wide-reaching genre would spawn numerous sub-genres, many of whom have their own means of engagement and corresponding audiences.

03:11.600 --> 03:20.360
While the most significant that arose during the 90s was a star called tabloid talk shows, a controversial and divisive genre that utilized the concept of guest involvement to the maximum.

03:20.400 --> 03:27.440
It soon dawned on TV producers that hosts weren't the only people who could be interesting, and that could serve a purpose as well.

03:27.440 --> 03:32.240
Can you say this, you dumb bitch? Can you read the f***ing line, you stupid bitch?

03:34.240 --> 03:36.240
What are you talking about? What is this?

03:36.240 --> 03:38.240
What do you mean you can replace, bitch?

03:38.240 --> 03:46.680
In the years following, a lot of these shows cropped up that broadcast what would normally be extremely personal disputes, and the explosive confrontations that would follow from them.

03:46.720 --> 03:53.280
Add in many people's desire for their five minutes for fame, and orchestration designed to heighten tension between the parties involved,

03:53.280 --> 03:58.320
and you were often left with highly theatrical, yet extremely real coverage of interpersonal troubles.

03:58.320 --> 04:01.680
For some it was entertaining, but for others it was unwatchable.

04:01.680 --> 04:11.400
Enter stage left Oprah Winfrey, the queen of TV talk shows, who some argue made the industry more accessible to tabloid shows due to the intimate nature of her own.

04:11.440 --> 04:17.320
Her often very personal statements and opinions through the guise of a large media personality caught a lot of people's attention.

04:17.320 --> 04:28.240
With that said, Oprah was also thought to not be entirely comfortable with that presentation, and sought to retain a more conventional and professional structure that wouldn't conflate her with an often turbulent genre.

04:28.240 --> 04:35.400
One of these measures undertaken was to involve experts in certain segments, and provide an extra veneer of credibility for the discourse at hand.

04:35.400 --> 04:40.760
One of these experts was an individual by the name of Phil McGraw, who held a PhD in clinical psychology.

04:40.800 --> 04:49.960
Oprah had met Phil a few years prior while working with his trial consultancy firm CSI, after being sued for statements she had made on her show relating to mad cow disease.

04:49.960 --> 04:59.240
After that beef was settled, she offered McGraw a visiting spot on Oprah, where he would be brought on to discuss questions surrounding relationships and general life hardships with her guests.

04:59.240 --> 05:05.480
With their focus being on the host, a lot of shows experimented with different styles, and not too soon after, we were asking the question,

05:05.480 --> 05:12.240
what if we had an expert in subject X or subject Y as a host, and how would that influence how they interact with their guests?

05:12.240 --> 05:15.400
Dr Phil seemed to serve as the answer to this question.

05:15.400 --> 05:20.000
The only person in the world I've ever wanted to cheer for me was him.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
Look at him.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
The only person in the world...

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
Stand up.

05:28.000 --> 05:33.000
You're hiding from him. I want you to look at him, and let me tell you something, I want you to listen.

05:33.240 --> 05:36.480
I don't want you to go off and think about what you're going to say in response.

05:36.480 --> 05:41.200
I want you to listen and look her in the eye and hear what she's saying.

05:41.200 --> 05:46.640
These segments proved to be extremely popular, with Oprah giving them an increasingly regular presence on her program.

05:46.640 --> 05:54.440
As this popularity persisted, Winfrey, being the business person that she is, decided that Dr Phil McGraw's sections had the potential to be its own TV series.

05:54.440 --> 06:02.520
So in 2002, four years after our visiting expert made his debut appearance on Oprah, Dr Phil was launched to impressive ratings that had maintained themselves

06:02.560 --> 06:10.280
during the show's long and illustrious lifespan, receiving multiple Daytime Emmy nominations, and praise from viewers who feel that Dr Phil's more measured approach to his guests

06:10.280 --> 06:12.960
allows them to be viewed through a more human lens.

06:12.960 --> 06:17.800
However, as we've seen with other talk show hosts, what is presented is never quite the full picture.

06:17.800 --> 06:25.280
It should go without saying that TV is very selective, even more so than other mediums, and over time, Dr Phil's show garnered more and more critics,

06:25.280 --> 06:29.160
who questioned the professionalism and ethics behind the treatment of the guests involved,

06:29.160 --> 06:35.880
also culminating in a flurry of allegations made by former employees and guests towards the show's producers, and of course the man himself,

06:35.880 --> 06:40.200
leading many to question whether the show was really a force for good.

06:40.200 --> 06:47.000
Well, ladies, gentlemen, and all complementary variations, today we'll delve into Dr Phil, the rise and success of the show,

06:47.000 --> 06:56.680
alongside its notable social media renaissance, we'll also investigate the controversy and the concomitant ethical questions of our beloved TV title at the centre of today's video.

06:56.680 --> 07:02.360
My friends, let us not dwell any longer, it is time to discuss the dangers of Dr Phil.

07:03.560 --> 07:05.560
And now, ad time.

07:08.040 --> 07:16.920
When it comes to making videos, I have many weapons in my arsenal, but there's one secret weapon that's so powerful, former president George W. Bush wants to invade my house.

07:16.920 --> 07:24.440
You see my friends, I am harbouring a weapon of mass production, so it's time for me to open up and let you see it.

07:24.840 --> 07:32.680
This is vidIQ, yes, the vidIQ, the secret weapon that helps you print out bangers like the Weimar Republic prints money.

07:32.680 --> 07:39.640
How? Let's just say it'll give you much needed help on video titles, titles that will actually make people gaze upon its poetry.

07:39.640 --> 07:45.320
Not enough? How about some time tinkering with the algorithm so it picks up views from trending videos similar to yours?

07:45.320 --> 07:51.160
Maybe stealing some of Jay Aubrey's viewers for your own? I mean, what's that twink gonna do about it?

07:51.160 --> 08:03.400
Now, you're probably worried about your enemies, your competitors, or even your friends. Maybe all three, but don't worry, vidIQ will spy on all those trending keywords they're using, with more commitment and dedication than the KGB.

08:03.400 --> 08:14.440
Now, this powerful weapon can't work if you don't work. Fort is a YouTuber who carries an empty vessel of ideas, a useless being leeching off the nectar of society, that's what.

08:14.600 --> 08:20.360
So that's it, you may say, vidIQ cannot be of any assistance because you simply do not have the imagination.

08:20.360 --> 08:34.600
I mean, it's not like it can come up with 50 video ideas every day for you, right? Wrong. Because it will. 50 ideas each day. Save that pesky thought process for more fitting scenarios like Overwatch 2.

08:34.600 --> 08:42.200
So now you're asking, how can this possibly be? You're thinking, surely there's no team of humans big enough to do all this work for you.

08:42.200 --> 08:54.520
And you're right, no team of humans could ever be big enough for such a colossal task. But what if I told you it's not humans that run this? What if I told you it's all run by a powerful AI?

08:54.520 --> 09:02.840
This AI will scour every inch of YouTube for you, providing you with all the information you could ever need about what those YouTubers are up to.

09:02.840 --> 09:10.760
But I can tell that you're worried. You're asking if this powerful AI follows Asimov's three laws of artificial intelligence. A good question.

09:10.760 --> 09:20.440
All I can say is that during the robot apocalypse, I think vidIQ will be on the side of humanity. But how much can this monthly subscription possibly cost?

09:20.440 --> 09:27.880
How much can a weapon of such power break the bank? Can you even put a price on an AI rivaling God themselves?

09:27.880 --> 09:39.720
Well the bigwigs over at vidIQ HQ said $49 a month, but that wasn't good enough for me. So engaging my exquisite negotiation skills and some articulate ransom notes,

09:39.720 --> 09:50.600
I have brought the price of their first month down by nearly 99%. So now you lovely people can venture onto YouTube with vidIQ for just $1 for their first month.

09:50.600 --> 10:03.880
Yes, $1. Nearly 99% off. That's like buying a nondescript certain YouTuber's Tesla for $500. It's like reducing a life sentence for ransom to 6 months,

10:03.880 --> 10:12.360
which would be great in this instance. It's Rishi Sunak reduced to just his thumb and leading the nation like he does now. I don't know about you,

10:12.360 --> 10:19.560
but a thumb seems like a very electable option to me. If this proposition interests you, click the link in the description below

10:19.560 --> 10:28.200
to subscribe to vidIQ for $1 for the first month, see how you like it. It might just change your game. Back to the video.

10:41.960 --> 10:48.600
Allow me to introduce you to a man that you may not have heard of. This champ is called Les Crane, and in the 1960s he had a somewhat

10:48.600 --> 10:54.360
popular late night program fittingly called The Les Crane Show. In an attempt to compete with other programs at the time,

10:54.360 --> 11:00.120
they introduced a format which involved a shotgun microphone and members of the audience, whom he would proceed to grill on a multitude of

11:00.120 --> 11:04.520
affairs, including socially sensitive topics of that time, such as homosexuality.

11:04.520 --> 11:13.640
I have to differ with you, I have to argue with you on that one point there, because there are some homosexuals who are that way because of either

11:13.640 --> 11:22.520
environment or because of a background that has caused them to go that route. Now, that doesn't mean that all homosexuals are sick people.

11:22.520 --> 11:29.520
But not through, it's not something that happens through seduction or anything like that, the background is just that they grew up in a society,

11:29.520 --> 11:36.680
and they found the existing heterosexual norms, not to their liking, whether it was the way they perceived their own parental relationships.

11:37.160 --> 11:42.880
On one episode, he had hosted a debate with Lee Harvey Oswald's mother on the topic of her son's guilt, which was concluded with an

11:42.920 --> 11:47.920
editorial recap from Mel Brooks of all people, but unfortunately, I couldn't retrieve any footage of such.

11:47.920 --> 11:54.720
By all means, Les Crane was perceived as a vigorous, yet reasoned interviewer, and although the tabloid label was retroactively applied to his show,

11:54.720 --> 11:59.000
not too long after followed what many believe was a more fitting prototype for the genre.

12:00.000 --> 12:25.200
This is Joe Pine, he was another 50s and 60s talk show host who garnered popularity on radio and TV for his often outspoken and opinionated demeanor.

12:25.200 --> 12:33.280
However, in 1965, his own self-titled talk show went into wide syndication, these typically involved fiery discussions with highly controversial guests,

12:33.280 --> 12:38.320
coloured by Pine's own racially progressive, yet otherwise socially conservative political positions.

12:38.320 --> 12:45.680
These conversations would regularly escalate into shouting matches, and even physical aggression, with reports being that chairs would regularly be thrown,

12:45.680 --> 12:52.440
and Pine would have to eject his guests live on TV. Although receiving criticism for his platforming of vicious and even dangerous individuals,

12:52.480 --> 12:56.600
he continued to retain a steady viewership until the show's cessation a couple years later.

12:56.600 --> 13:04.560
In the years following, a number of hosts utilised similar blueprints for their talk shows, but after the heights of the Vietnam War and hippie culture that were a catalyst for a lot of these broadcasts,

13:04.560 --> 13:10.960
the genre maintained a middling profile that wasn't the source of great discourse, mostly carried by Phil Donahue and Dick Cavett,

13:10.960 --> 13:16.280
both of whom were known for their slightly more dignified techniques, though not without their exceptional moments.

13:16.280 --> 13:22.560
However, this began to change once more in the 1980s, with the emergence of shows that catered towards more controversial subjects

13:22.560 --> 13:26.200
that regularly resulted in conflicts between the guests and the hosts.

13:26.200 --> 13:27.280
Go ahead and talk.

13:27.280 --> 13:27.960
So shut up.

13:27.960 --> 13:29.560
No, no, you shut up.

13:29.560 --> 13:30.320
So shut up.

13:30.320 --> 13:31.600
Sit down.

13:31.600 --> 13:32.440
Sit down.

13:32.440 --> 13:34.040
You had your chance of fame.

13:34.040 --> 13:35.720
You had your chance of fame.

13:35.720 --> 13:36.520
Sit down.

13:36.520 --> 13:37.720
You had your chance of fame.

13:37.720 --> 13:38.720
So look out.

13:38.720 --> 13:39.720
Come on.

13:39.720 --> 13:40.720
Come on.

13:40.720 --> 13:41.720
Come on.

13:41.720 --> 13:42.720
Come on.

13:42.720 --> 13:43.720
Come on.

13:43.720 --> 13:44.720
Come on.

13:44.720 --> 13:45.720
Come on.

13:45.720 --> 13:46.720
Come on.

13:46.720 --> 13:47.720
Come on.

13:47.720 --> 13:53.120
Probably the most famous example of this is Jerry Springer, the syndicated show named after its host.

13:53.120 --> 13:58.480
Springer, a former lawyer and civic official, had initially conceived the show as a forum for political debate,

13:58.480 --> 14:03.040
but after a few unsuccessful seasons, Springer and his new producer overhauled this concept,

14:03.040 --> 14:07.360
and decided to focus on more personal issues with members of the public as their guests,

14:07.360 --> 14:12.080
complemented by scripted sequences that would regularly escalate into physical confrontation,

14:12.080 --> 14:15.040
sort of like Oprah meets WWE.

14:15.040 --> 14:20.800
It clearly took a few notes from Joe Pine's show, while replacing the political content with more sociological matters.

14:20.800 --> 14:25.120
Although the scripted sequences would eventually be scrapped, the topics were similarly contentious,

14:25.120 --> 14:28.320
and were still the source of numerous controversies over the years that followed.

14:28.320 --> 14:32.800
However, the success spoke for itself, and it wasn't long before the genre was more popular than ever,

14:32.800 --> 14:38.000
featuring multiple syndicated shows with different hosts and international producers taking an interest as well.

14:38.000 --> 14:41.840
Probably the most famous overseas example in the UK is The Jeremy Carr Show,

14:41.840 --> 14:46.880
which ran for a total of 17 seasons, and was no less frenzied than its American contemporaries.

14:46.880 --> 14:53.200
There! Listen! Look, I'm a boyfriend! Oh, don't worry about you!

14:53.200 --> 14:57.600
You didn't mean it! I was with you all the time! Everyone's seen you all the time!

14:57.600 --> 14:59.600
Keep going! I'm with you!

14:59.600 --> 15:04.880
Oh, shut up, me!

15:04.880 --> 15:06.000
So there we go!

15:06.000 --> 15:11.520
Nonetheless, in spite of these ratings, the controversies are no less troubling for certain viewers, and even businesses.

15:11.520 --> 15:16.000
As entertaining as conflict can be, many hosts played a role that could be perceived as provocative,

15:16.000 --> 15:21.680
and as a person who is also trying to present themselves as an arbiter, that seemed a somewhat compromising problem.

15:21.680 --> 15:25.840
The audience also often didn't help, seeming more like citizens in a Roman Colosseum,

15:25.840 --> 15:29.200
ready to watch whatever gladiatorial combat was about to transpire.

15:29.200 --> 15:33.840
Producers also participated by purposefully choosing topics that would garner the most views,

15:33.840 --> 15:37.760
but at the same time, could also cause the most damage to the people actually involved.

15:37.760 --> 15:42.640
Anyone who's familiar with conflict resolution knows the last thing you need is a large mob egging you on,

15:42.640 --> 15:47.360
and therefore this sort of TV, although entertaining for some, was deeply discomforting for others.

15:47.360 --> 15:51.280
A lot of these shows have been taken off air since, some the result of host fatigue,

15:51.280 --> 15:55.280
some the result of TV scandals, and some the result of actual deaths.

15:55.280 --> 15:59.040
Many of these shows also employed methods that were questionable in their authority.

15:59.040 --> 16:03.120
A polygraph or lie detector, for example, is always a popular piece of equipment.

16:03.120 --> 16:08.560
Its accuracy, however, is never guaranteed, yet its word was treated like gospel on all of these programs.

16:08.560 --> 16:13.680
In the case of The Jeremy Carr Show, it was taken off the air after a guest who was known to have suffered from depression,

16:13.680 --> 16:19.200
took his own life following his appearance and failure of a polygraph, of which Carr persistently insulted his guest,

16:19.200 --> 16:25.200
and branded him a serial liar, of which the coroner concluded could well have contributed to his untimely death.

16:25.200 --> 16:28.960
With The Revelation, there were probably other people who suffered the same fate as well.

16:28.960 --> 16:33.760
I'd like to say that it was a sudden moral consciousness that kicked in the demise of many of these shows,

16:33.760 --> 16:38.080
but I think it became apparent to producers and studios that these shows were liabilities,

16:38.080 --> 16:42.080
and that if they continued to utilise techniques that provoked their guests in such a way,

16:42.080 --> 16:45.280
they could easily be facing some very serious lawsuits.

16:45.280 --> 16:52.320
So over the 21st century, these shows have slowly faded into re-run rotation, but what could have taken its place?

16:54.160 --> 16:57.920
Well, this is where Dr. Phil makes his grand entrance.

17:01.920 --> 17:06.240
When he arrived on the scene in 2002, this sort of content was just passing its peak,

17:06.240 --> 17:08.160
but still pulling significant ratings.

17:08.160 --> 17:12.560
The market was pretty saturated, and there were more than enough talk show hosts for viewers to choose from.

17:12.560 --> 17:18.160
The only real thing he had going for him on paper was his qualifications, and the backing of the behemoth that was Oprah.

17:18.160 --> 17:22.320
However, he'd need more than that for the sort of longevity that she had enjoyed.

17:22.320 --> 17:24.400
What would he do to ensure that?

17:24.400 --> 17:27.440
Well, let me introduce you to Dr. Phil.

17:27.440 --> 17:43.200
The year now is 2022, if my upload schedule is intact, and Dr. Phil has been up and running for 20 seasons.

17:43.200 --> 17:48.640
It has outlasted nearly every tabloid talk show, a majority of normal talk shows, including Oprah,

17:48.640 --> 17:50.560
and still pulls significant viewership.

17:51.160 --> 17:53.040
He must have done something right.

17:53.440 --> 17:56.360
You call people trailer trash or rednecks.

17:56.360 --> 17:56.960
I have.

17:57.240 --> 18:00.440
Okay, 90% of people are stupid.

18:01.440 --> 18:05.440
There should be a law passed against stupid people.

18:07.740 --> 18:09.760
Well, you better hope that isn't true.

18:09.960 --> 18:16.200
From the off, Dr. Phil seemed to set himself apart from the competition, particularly in his approach to how he treated guests.

18:16.200 --> 18:19.720
I think many hosts, even the ones that were probably more sensitive than most,

18:19.720 --> 18:25.000
didn't have the human background to navigate the complex issues that many of these shows often sought to tackle.

18:25.020 --> 18:27.480
Now, McGraw wasn't a full time psychologist.

18:27.480 --> 18:29.920
As we know, he was a bit of a jack of all trades,

18:29.920 --> 18:35.560
but his educational background in clinical psychology and at least some degree of practical experience made him a much

18:35.560 --> 18:39.840
better fit for the moderating position that such an individual should typically occupy.

18:40.320 --> 18:48.060
You also said women are really emotional, and men are logical, and I got the sense,

18:48.100 --> 18:49.980
and I'm just asked you tell me what you think.

18:49.980 --> 18:54.140
I'm not trying to I just want to know where you come down on it.

18:54.700 --> 18:58.780
You said that is, though logic is at this level,

18:58.780 --> 19:03.060
and emotion is at a lesser level of functioning.

19:03.060 --> 19:05.380
Is that how you think he feels?

19:05.740 --> 19:10.740
Psychology isn't just about knowing all these behavioral terms or knowing how to approach them.

19:10.740 --> 19:13.060
Honestly, that would make pretty dry TV.

19:13.100 --> 19:19.340
A lot of the art is in being able to deconstruct people's behavior and language to reach the core of how they're feeling.

19:19.380 --> 19:24.420
The truth is, a lot of people don't say how they're feeling, particularly in these situations when their behaviors or

19:24.420 --> 19:25.660
beliefs may be challenged.

19:25.660 --> 19:32.060
It's a very interpretive job and requires picking out certain details that you may typically overlook in everyday conversation.

19:32.100 --> 19:34.180
Now, I'm sure Dr Phil has his own style.

19:34.200 --> 19:37.620
However, when the show started, he definitely demonstrated this ability,

19:37.640 --> 19:42.220
and this often allowed him to connect with his guests more successfully than others from around his time.

19:42.460 --> 19:44.300
And you feel guilty about this, don't you?

19:45.060 --> 19:47.420
You feel guilty about where she is and what she's doing?

19:47.420 --> 19:47.860
Yes.

19:48.140 --> 19:48.700
Do you?

19:49.900 --> 19:52.540
Because you guys say we're kind of blaming ourselves for this.

19:53.060 --> 19:55.220
Have you intended to sabotage your daughter?

19:55.240 --> 19:55.580
No.

19:55.700 --> 19:57.300
Have you intended to make her stubborn?

19:57.340 --> 19:57.660
No.

19:57.740 --> 19:58.620
Non-compliant?

19:58.620 --> 19:58.860
No.

19:58.860 --> 20:00.900
Disobedient, rebellious.

20:01.340 --> 20:03.020
So we need to put blame out of this.

20:03.020 --> 20:05.500
Parents don't need to be feeling blame about this.

20:05.780 --> 20:11.780
What you need to be thinking about here is that you have a responsibility for what's happened.

20:11.940 --> 20:17.340
Dr Phil took a familiar formula, the fact that one or more people had a problem, the problem affected their daily life,

20:17.340 --> 20:18.500
and they wish to address it.

20:18.580 --> 20:22.900
Now, when you present this scenario to a majority of tabloid talk show hosts or their producers,

20:22.900 --> 20:25.780
the question will be, how can we generate the most drama?

20:25.780 --> 20:30.660
The approach that Dr Phil appears to take is more related to how can this problem be addressed?

20:30.700 --> 20:33.900
And for many, there's a great satisfaction within problem resolution.

20:33.940 --> 20:37.940
Other talk show hosts presented talking about your problems as being intimidating,

20:37.940 --> 20:40.700
and certainly didn't really inspire people to seek out help.

20:40.700 --> 20:45.540
And to be fair to Dr Phil, studies have shown that viewers of his shows are more likely to do just that,

20:45.540 --> 20:47.820
and that's really nothing to turn your nose up at.

20:47.860 --> 20:52.220
When dealing with certain disputes, he didn't seem to be insensitive to the human facts of play.

20:52.260 --> 20:54.780
The human factors are what made Dr Phil appealing.

20:54.820 --> 20:58.940
One of the skills to what his show does is one that I describe as extraction.

20:58.980 --> 21:02.380
A lot of the time, Dr Phil would be presented with a specific situation,

21:02.380 --> 21:06.460
one that on the surface could be rather niche and certainly not applicable to you or I.

21:06.500 --> 21:09.060
Everyone has their own unique situations and challenges,

21:09.060 --> 21:12.820
but a lot of the time they can also be rooted in general struggles that can affect anyone,

21:12.860 --> 21:18.500
and by being able to focus on that, he could connect with audience members who may be emotionally moved by hearing such struggles.

21:18.540 --> 21:20.380
This is something he's referenced in interviews,

21:20.380 --> 21:24.540
and although some would justifiably find it a bit objectifying towards his guests,

21:24.580 --> 21:26.940
it's also definitely the source of some success.

21:28.020 --> 21:35.220
What I'm recommending is empirically supported in the psychological and psychiatric literature,

21:35.940 --> 21:42.020
and I don't diagnose people, and I say very clearly, I can't diagnose you here.

21:42.060 --> 21:45.660
I would have to complete a lot more interview than I have time to do.

21:45.700 --> 21:48.740
I would have to do a battery of psychometric tests.

21:48.780 --> 21:52.940
I'd probably have to do a brain workup and some lab work, and I can't do that here.

21:52.980 --> 21:57.900
Now, in the short list of my considerations, if I was doing it, might be the following,

21:57.940 --> 22:00.820
but these are things you're going to check out when you leave here.

22:00.900 --> 22:07.260
And so they look at that and say, you know what, I think this guy's checking all the boxes.

22:07.300 --> 22:14.340
Yeah. Well, so it just seems from that explanation that what you're doing is more for everybody else than for the person sitting in that chair, maybe.

22:14.380 --> 22:16.140
They're teaching tools.

22:16.180 --> 22:17.460
Everybody there is a teaching tool.

22:17.500 --> 22:19.700
If I'm talking to you, it's a trade-off.

22:19.740 --> 22:24.820
You get up close and personal focus and lots of resources,

22:24.820 --> 22:30.740
because I have a blue ribbon advisory board with the top minds from the top learning centers in the country.

22:30.780 --> 22:34.740
I do think it can help to put individuals more in touch with their own mental health,

22:34.780 --> 22:39.180
with mind to the fact that such information should be handled carefully, which will put a pin in for now.

22:39.220 --> 22:48.620
Did it never occur to you that, you know what, I'm putting myself first and my need to vent and my need to explode.

22:48.660 --> 22:51.580
I'm putting that ahead of my children's best interest.

22:51.620 --> 22:52.740
He yells at me too.

22:52.780 --> 22:53.940
You don't get it.

22:54.020 --> 22:57.380
I hope all of you at home get it, but you don't get it.

22:57.420 --> 23:01.180
The angle that Dr. Phil adopts is also really important for audience retention.

23:01.220 --> 23:05.820
There are lots of causes for people's mistakes and misdeeds, some of which we'll never understand.

23:05.860 --> 23:09.300
However, Dr. Phil's focus on personal responsibility is universal.

23:09.340 --> 23:12.780
I wholeheartedly believe good people can do bad things and learn from them.

23:12.820 --> 23:16.660
At the same time, the only way to properly grow is to accept responsibility,

23:16.700 --> 23:22.700
because if you assign all rationale for your behavior to external circumstances, you're admitting you don't have control over your actions.

23:22.700 --> 23:26.580
Personal responsibility is the driving force for change, and by focusing on that,

23:26.620 --> 23:31.500
Dr. Phil ensures that his show has the ability to find the solution within the problems presented.

23:31.540 --> 23:37.380
In discussing people's specific problems, McGraw always managed to approach it from a perspective that gave it mass appeal,

23:37.420 --> 23:42.300
retaining its educational grounding, while still speaking directly to the guests.

23:42.340 --> 23:44.140
It was accessible, yet challenging.

23:44.180 --> 23:48.380
I don't doubt it has probably helped a fair few people in not just understanding themselves,

23:48.380 --> 23:53.980
but possibly being more empathetic to those around them, and impossibly recognizing those same signs.

23:54.020 --> 24:00.900
Dr. Phil's demeanor also aids viewers in how they may feel morally about watching content that could typically leave vulnerable individuals

24:00.940 --> 24:02.900
somewhat exposed in the eye of the media.

24:02.940 --> 24:10.260
As much as gladiatorial combat enthralls those who desire it, there's always the question of the cost to those brave warriors who put themselves out there.

24:10.300 --> 24:15.340
The Dr. Phil show presented discussion on these matters as if they were the first step to getting genuine help,

24:15.340 --> 24:21.100
and therefore, viewers could feel more at ease believing that they weren't necessarily contributing to a harmful practice.

24:21.140 --> 24:25.020
A lot of guests seemed to be in a better place after a discussion with Dr. Phil,

24:25.060 --> 24:31.340
and whereas other tabloid talk show hosts almost focused on escalation, the art of Dr. Phil seemed to be de-escalation.

24:31.380 --> 24:37.100
Each reaches some sort of conclusion, but the latter seems more mutually favorable in the long term.

24:37.140 --> 24:41.420
I think in this case, Dr. Phil carved out an industry niche like very few others,

24:41.460 --> 24:46.380
the show that took a genre nearly done to death and subverted it, and started its own trend,

24:46.420 --> 24:52.460
this being what some branded as self-help TV, a more conscious way to approach issues that have previously been treated with apathy,

24:52.460 --> 24:54.780
and even provocation on mainstream television.

24:55.180 --> 24:59.260
It's clear that Dr. Phil saw himself less as a therapist and more as a moderator,

24:59.300 --> 25:04.700
and wished to present himself as the reasonable voice within often two very strongly contrasting ones,

25:04.740 --> 25:11.220
and for many viewers, they perceived him as just that, and tuned in to hear that voice discuss affairs that may hit close to home.

25:11.580 --> 25:15.820
And as one of the pioneers of this new movement, it was only upwards from there.

25:16.220 --> 25:17.980
But was there something more at stake?

25:41.420 --> 25:52.060
One of the common appraisals of Dr. Phil is that he was clearly an intelligent guy,

25:52.100 --> 25:53.460
and there was little doubt about that.

25:53.500 --> 25:57.140
The dude knew how to present a TV show, and as the ratings followed suit,

25:57.140 --> 26:01.020
he enjoyed success that even rivaled his superiors, and over the coming decades,

26:01.020 --> 26:03.380
he would only grow his influence as a cultural icon.

26:03.460 --> 26:08.780
At first, many viewers did consider him of the more academic cloth, particularly with his background and experience.

26:08.860 --> 26:12.540
However, professional psychologists seldom have illustrious TV careers,

26:12.540 --> 26:16.060
because the topic is often at odds with a lot of the principles of entertainment.

26:16.100 --> 26:21.940
I think McGraw identified this pretty quickly, and in interviews, he didn't tie himself too closely to the occupation,

26:21.980 --> 26:26.380
more emphasizing his nature to inform people to go and receive proper help.

26:26.780 --> 26:30.500
A lot of individuals might speculate on how Dr. Phil evolved over the years.

26:30.500 --> 26:33.740
A lot of TV shows tend to change, and when discussing talk shows,

26:33.740 --> 26:36.140
they often evolved to their structure to stay relevant,

26:36.140 --> 26:39.980
and even somewhat acceptable within the ever-adjusting moral compass of the viewers.

26:40.020 --> 26:41.740
Dr. Phil was different in this sense.

26:41.740 --> 26:44.180
He maintained a lot of consistency with his style.

26:44.220 --> 26:47.940
However, what I think changed was how it was presented and perceived by others around it.

26:47.980 --> 26:51.180
Indeed, as that style garnered popularity in the mainstream industry,

26:51.180 --> 26:55.260
he found a new status as a bit of an oracle on affairs affecting the world in general,

26:55.260 --> 26:59.540
and one that placed him in a rather unique position, but posed a few challenges of their own.

26:59.580 --> 27:01.740
However, the doctor here responded accordingly.

27:02.260 --> 27:11.180
I do believe that there comes a moment in time where all things wrong can be made right.

27:12.260 --> 27:16.380
But if we're gonna do this, we're gonna do this my way.

27:17.060 --> 27:22.140
In 2006, McGraw chose not to renew his license to practice psychology professionally in Texas.

27:22.180 --> 27:24.940
Some may ask whether this affected his ability to run his show.

27:24.940 --> 27:27.260
However, in California, where said show was based,

27:27.260 --> 27:30.380
their respective Board of Psychology reported to have agreed that Dr.

27:30.380 --> 27:35.220
Phil does not actually practice psychology on his show and therefore does not require a license.

27:35.220 --> 27:36.820
Some have questioned why he did this,

27:36.820 --> 27:40.140
and my personal opinion holds that if he didn't actually need it for his show,

27:40.140 --> 27:42.740
then it likely became a liability in his eyes.

27:42.780 --> 27:46.380
Being a practicing psychologist obviously comes with certain responsibilities,

27:46.380 --> 27:48.620
and if he or his show was found to have breached them,

27:48.660 --> 27:51.860
even if he wasn't presenting himself in a psychological capacity,

27:51.900 --> 27:54.620
then he could have landed himself in some serious shit,

27:54.660 --> 27:59.500
which would have generated a lot more controversy than him just opting not to renew his license.

28:09.380 --> 28:13.140
A lot of people found this out during Britney Spears' life crisis in 2008.

28:13.180 --> 28:14.940
During a stint where she had been hospitalized,

28:14.940 --> 28:17.980
her parents, clearly eager to support her, invited Dr.

28:17.980 --> 28:21.180
Phil to her bedside, an invitation which he readily accepted.

28:21.220 --> 28:22.300
However, after his visit,

28:22.300 --> 28:24.540
Dr. Phil decided to issue a public statement,

28:24.540 --> 28:28.180
expressing an urgency for the troubled pop star to receive medical support.

28:28.220 --> 28:30.540
This was met with disappointment from Spears' parents,

28:30.540 --> 28:34.420
who expressed that McGraw had violated their trust by issuing a public statement,

28:34.420 --> 28:38.740
and it was even alleged that a complaint had been filed to the Board of Psychology that McGraw had practiced

28:38.740 --> 28:40.340
psychology without a license.

28:40.340 --> 28:43.940
Now, there are a few more layers to this than a lot of press reported at the time.

28:43.940 --> 28:49.900
Dr. Phil did actually know Britney's parents in a personal capacity and claimed to have attended the hospital as a friend,

28:49.900 --> 28:51.100
and not a therapist.

28:51.100 --> 28:55.620
Nonetheless, it still engendered a lot of discourse about his responsibility as a public figure,

28:55.620 --> 28:58.260
and his outspoken reputation on mental health,

28:58.260 --> 29:02.300
with many asking the question of whether he had actually breached his responsibility as a confidant.

29:02.300 --> 29:04.980
Dr. Phil did actually issue a response to this on his website,

29:04.980 --> 29:09.980
where he clarified he did not practice psychology and had no intent to practice it in the foreseeable future.

29:09.980 --> 29:14.820
It definitely showcased the dichotomy with how many audience members viewed him and how he viewed himself,

29:14.820 --> 29:16.100
and in spite of these statements,

29:16.100 --> 29:19.180
many still held him as an expert in his respective field,

29:19.180 --> 29:21.420
and to be fair, it's not like he disagreed.

29:21.420 --> 29:26.980
In his statement, he still drew attention to the fact that he had decades of experience and a PhD to show for it.

29:26.980 --> 29:28.900
He was still a doctor after all.

29:28.900 --> 29:32.380
Although Dr. Phil didn't seem to change in his approach towards guests,

29:32.380 --> 29:36.500
not too long after dropping his license, McGraw seemed to expand his franchise.

29:36.500 --> 29:40.980
Many continued to utilize the notion of expert advice, including the show The Doctors,

29:40.980 --> 29:44.380
which, although not featuring McGraw, was created and produced by him.

29:44.380 --> 29:48.100
The Doctors is another talk show that leans more into the general medical issues,

29:48.100 --> 29:52.540
and was relatively successful, being canceled in 2022 after 14 seasons.

29:52.540 --> 29:55.220
Another recent show, House Calls with Dr. Phil,

29:55.220 --> 30:00.140
once more uses a trope more associated with traditional doctors who may be called to a patient's abode,

30:00.140 --> 30:04.620
though looking at the state of healthcare nowadays, I'm surprised we didn't get phone calls with Dr. Phil.

30:04.620 --> 30:06.820
He also launched the company Doctor on Demand,

30:06.820 --> 30:10.700
which allowed individuals to schedule appointments with medical and psychological professionals.

30:10.700 --> 30:14.860
I'll say that it's a good thing he was providing a platform for more licensed experts,

30:14.900 --> 30:19.980
but I also think it's indicative of the fact that he still enjoyed his status and wanted to make the most of it.

30:19.980 --> 30:23.340
The truth was, whether he felt like a practicing psychologist or not,

30:23.340 --> 30:25.300
it was clear how other people viewed him.

30:25.300 --> 30:31.540
The other reason why there aren't a lot of TV figures in the realm of Dr. Phil's is because of the sensitivity of humans themselves,

30:31.540 --> 30:33.300
and the trouble that can cause.

30:33.300 --> 30:35.460
Dr. Phil was no stranger to that either.

30:35.460 --> 30:39.420
In fact, even his most successful, he could be facing multiple lawsuits,

30:39.420 --> 30:43.420
mostly from disgruntled guests who were unhappy with their portrayal of the show.

30:43.420 --> 30:46.380
A large majority of these lawsuits were fairly quickly dismissed,

30:46.380 --> 30:49.300
with judges finding the coverage provided by Dr. Phil was fair,

30:49.300 --> 30:52.340
and McGraw's language being protected under the First Amendment.

30:52.340 --> 30:55.340
Dr. Phil occupied this near bulletproof position,

30:55.340 --> 30:58.260
where his words were viewed as holding a significant amount of weight,

30:58.260 --> 31:04.100
yet could never officially bear that much responsibility as he operated and presented the show as a talk show host.

31:04.100 --> 31:05.700
He may not have changed his method,

31:05.700 --> 31:11.220
but he definitely shifted his image towards a more business oriented model that provided him with more protection.

31:11.220 --> 31:15.260
He would regularly make TV appearances and stage interventions with other celebrities,

31:15.260 --> 31:17.740
ordinary people, or washed up TV stars.

31:17.740 --> 31:23.740
Obtaining this Messiah-like status amongst many is the guy who would fly in and rescue you from your lowest points,

31:23.740 --> 31:25.500
or give you a good pep talk at least.

31:25.500 --> 31:28.660
As the halfway point between medical professional and entertainer,

31:28.660 --> 31:34.100
Dr. Phil had occupied a position in the media that enabled him to develop his brand with extensive influence,

31:34.100 --> 31:37.540
while maintaining an audience who respected his approach to sensitive matters.

31:37.580 --> 31:42.420
It was a devastating combination, and it seemed like there was very little that could undo it.

31:42.420 --> 31:49.220
However, would the necessity to occupy two quite conflicting positions pose a challenge as the media landscape evolved?

31:49.700 --> 31:51.620
Well, let's find out.

31:51.620 --> 32:05.780
Hey, Dr. Phil here.

32:05.780 --> 32:09.860
I'm backstage getting ready to do the show, which is where you're used to seeing me.

32:09.860 --> 32:14.860
But in the virtual world of computer games, I can be somebody completely different.

32:15.860 --> 32:24.860
I can be super mortal Phil, defender of my countrymen, and a super stud who gets to have cool hair while playing.

32:24.860 --> 32:32.860
And in this virtual world, I'm agile, powerful, and I never have to do what my wife says.

32:32.860 --> 32:37.860
As known to the start, this sort of content has mostly found its footing within the airwaves of mainstream television,

32:37.860 --> 32:41.860
and throughout most of its early lifespan, there was nothing that could really change that.

32:41.860 --> 32:47.860
However, over time, with the increasing influence of social media, opportunities presented themselves for TV networks to advertise,

32:47.860 --> 32:49.860
and possibly garner new viewers.

32:49.860 --> 32:56.860
It also served as an archive for viewers who may have missed the show, or wanted to rewatch popular clips without too much inconvenience.

32:56.860 --> 33:03.860
With this in mind, it's not hard to see why the Dr. Phil show was one of the earlier TV shows to serve a channel on the budding website known as YouTube.

33:03.860 --> 33:07.860
A platform like YouTube provided the perfect opportunity for success.

33:07.860 --> 33:12.860
At its inception, it only really allowed for shorter clips, which I know is hard to actually remember,

33:12.860 --> 33:19.860
but for a TV show like Dr. Phil, this meant that snippets of the show could be put online to hopefully reel new audience members in.

33:19.860 --> 33:23.860
However, at that time, YouTube was much more oriented towards homegrown content,

33:23.860 --> 33:28.860
and although the Dr. Phil producers tried their best by publishing multiple interviews with famous names,

33:28.860 --> 33:34.860
using clips often addressing trending topics, and even having McGraw respond to comments in his own YouTube series,

33:34.860 --> 33:37.860
nothing ever quite went viral like they may have hoped.

33:37.860 --> 33:42.860
This did not deter them though, and over the years, they continued to upload content that cultivated an audience,

33:42.860 --> 33:47.860
and as YouTube became more palatable to mainstream sources who were able to upload high definition content,

33:47.860 --> 33:54.860
and with users becoming more intrigued by subjects of Dr. Phil's episodes, the view count seemed to begin to pick up significantly.

33:54.860 --> 34:00.860
This was definitely aided by the rise of the early commentary genre that specialised in talking about other people,

34:00.860 --> 34:03.860
particularly those who may have been slightly more eccentric than the average Joe.

34:04.860 --> 34:05.860
It certainly paid off.

34:05.860 --> 34:10.860
It's just so fascinating when something catches like that girl. What is her name? The catch me outside girl.

34:10.860 --> 34:15.860
Uh, Danielle Bregoli or something? Something like that, yeah.

34:15.860 --> 34:18.860
Cause I didn't know her as the catch me outside girl.

34:19.860 --> 34:24.860
Another emerging trend was the nature for the internet to bestow meme status onto people.

34:24.860 --> 34:30.860
Now, this had its roots in something quite usual, our culture has always enjoyed making overnight sensations of relatively unknown figures.

34:30.860 --> 34:34.860
How the internet certainly made this easier, targeting people who stood out from the crowd,

34:34.860 --> 34:37.860
whether that be due to their behaviour or just their appearance.

34:37.860 --> 34:44.860
Now, in many ways, this could be quite fortuitous for someone like Dr. Phil, whose content was built on dealing with often challenging personas,

34:44.860 --> 34:51.860
but often to acquire such a status, a person needs to be a perfect storm of characteristics that hasn't been seen elsewhere,

34:51.860 --> 34:54.860
and those sorts of people are a rare breed.

34:54.860 --> 34:59.860
With that in mind, I'd like to introduce you to someone by the name of Danielle Bregoli.

34:59.860 --> 35:04.860
I'm pretty violent. I'm with her in the face cause she wouldn't get out of my face.

35:04.860 --> 35:08.860
Either I'm breaking down her door or she's breaking down my door.

35:08.860 --> 35:11.860
I don't stop till I start seeing dents in a door.

35:11.860 --> 35:17.860
Danielle Bregoli was like many Dr. Phil guests, a troubled youth who possess serious behavioral issues,

35:17.860 --> 35:21.860
and externalize them in a way that many youngsters have a tendency to do.

35:21.860 --> 35:27.860
Dr. Phil often showcased troubled teens on his show, and on paper, the premise of her appearance was not exceptional.

35:27.860 --> 35:32.860
However, paper can only account for so many variables, and when she took the stage in early 2016,

35:32.860 --> 35:36.860
it was clear that this was not going to be any ordinary episode.

35:36.860 --> 35:40.860
I ain't gonna lie, there's no reason to lie, everybody know already, like...

35:40.860 --> 35:48.860
What do you say to yourself that gives you the right to take somebody else's car?

35:48.860 --> 35:53.860
You're talking about sliding? F*** you mean? That's what makes me want to take the next bitch car.

35:53.860 --> 35:57.860
What now? I'm sorry I didn't get that. Are you speaking English?

35:57.860 --> 36:02.860
A lot of the youths that Dr. Phil addressed on the show definitely conformed to a certain mold.

36:02.860 --> 36:06.860
It was clear they were projecting aspects of culture they idolized onto themselves,

36:06.860 --> 36:11.860
and therefore that behavior, although sometimes extremely challenging, was not unfamiliar.

36:11.860 --> 36:18.860
Danielle Bregoli seemed to bring her own personal flavor to the role, and her extremely abrasive attitude also played into that.

36:18.860 --> 36:22.860
Dr. Phil in this case played the usual role of mediator attempting to reason with her,

36:22.860 --> 36:25.860
but sometimes people just aren't there to be reasoned with,

36:25.860 --> 36:28.860
and her relationship with the audience only inflamed that.

36:28.860 --> 36:31.860
Soon Danielle was turning on everyone within the vicinity,

36:31.860 --> 36:34.860
making threats that didn't seem quite as threatening as they could be.

36:34.860 --> 36:38.860
Did you say the hoes are laughing?

36:38.860 --> 36:39.860
Yep.

36:39.860 --> 36:41.860
So the audience are a bunch of hoes.

36:41.860 --> 36:42.860
Yep.

36:46.860 --> 36:49.860
Catch me outside, how bout dat?

36:49.860 --> 36:51.860
Catch me outside, how bout dat?

36:51.860 --> 36:55.860
Catch you outside, what does that mean?

36:55.860 --> 36:57.860
What'd I just say?

36:57.860 --> 36:59.860
At first it didn't pick up too many views,

36:59.860 --> 37:05.860
but over time it garnered traction, and eventually the famous quote at the end of the video became noteworthy to many online observers.

37:05.860 --> 37:08.860
It wasn't long until their antics were provided international coverage,

37:08.860 --> 37:13.860
and memes started cropping up all over social media that made a mockery out of her language and demeanor,

37:13.860 --> 37:15.860
amassing online notoriety.

37:15.860 --> 37:19.860
Although the show was instrumental in the facilitation of this popularity,

37:19.860 --> 37:22.860
Dr. Phil wasn't really at the center of this discourse,

37:22.860 --> 37:25.860
only one person really mattered, and that was Bregoli.

37:25.860 --> 37:27.860
However, she definitely started something online,

37:27.860 --> 37:32.860
and not too long after, a new genre of respiring commentators presented itself.

37:32.860 --> 37:34.860
Catch me outside, how bout dat?

37:34.860 --> 37:38.860
Bro, I give up on these kids nowadays, dude. I'm so done with these fucking kids.

37:38.860 --> 37:40.860
This is Trigga Trove.

37:40.860 --> 37:44.860
He was one of the first creators to pick up on the fascination with many Dr. Phil guests,

37:44.860 --> 37:47.860
particularly those that appealed to certain outlandish stereotypes.

37:48.860 --> 37:50.860
As Daniel Bregoli began to garner online attention,

37:50.860 --> 37:52.860
the then budding creator released a video titled,

37:52.860 --> 37:55.860
The Catch Me Outside, How Bout Dat Girl Roast,

37:55.860 --> 37:56.860
and the rest was history.

37:56.860 --> 37:58.860
Yeah, I know where the car at.

38:00.860 --> 38:01.860
You know where the car at?

38:01.860 --> 38:03.860
Did you go to fifth grade?

38:03.860 --> 38:05.860
Did you go to fifth grade?

38:05.860 --> 38:06.860
Did you go to fifth grade?

38:06.860 --> 38:08.860
Fifth grade? Fifth grade?

38:08.860 --> 38:11.860
God damn, Dr. Phil, you straight roasted her ass.

38:11.860 --> 38:12.860
Did you go to fifth grade?

38:12.860 --> 38:15.860
Dr. Phil, more like doctor, you gotta fucking chill.

38:15.860 --> 38:18.860
The then less than 2,000 subscriber creator had struck gold,

38:18.860 --> 38:21.860
and he only continued in that direction for the following year.

38:21.860 --> 38:24.860
That is childish and immature behaviour.

38:24.860 --> 38:26.860
Now I get to leave.

38:26.860 --> 38:27.860
Yes, you do.

38:27.860 --> 38:28.860
No.

38:28.860 --> 38:30.860
Don't let the door hit you in the ass.

38:30.860 --> 38:33.860
Oh my God, what a savage.

38:33.860 --> 38:36.860
I didn't realise Dr. Phil was such a gangster.

38:36.860 --> 38:40.860
Dozens of Dr. Phil videos became the focus of online content,

38:40.860 --> 38:41.860
reaching more audiences than ever,

38:41.860 --> 38:43.860
and the producers, as they always have been,

38:43.860 --> 38:45.860
were sure to cash in on this new opportunity,

38:45.860 --> 38:48.860
publishing more content on the platform than they ever had before.

38:48.860 --> 38:50.860
Today on an all new Dr. Phil.

38:50.860 --> 38:52.860
You're ugly, you're disgusting,

38:52.860 --> 38:54.860
I'm gonna kill you, give me $200.

38:54.860 --> 38:58.860
Damn, Dr. Phil's a stone cold savage.

38:58.860 --> 39:00.860
I didn't know Dr. Phil would come after you like that.

39:00.860 --> 39:02.860
I mean, he did try and break into my house one time.

39:02.860 --> 39:04.860
I want the money.

39:04.860 --> 39:08.860
I'll raise enough hell till you give in and give it to me.

39:11.860 --> 39:13.860
What do you think of me now?

39:16.860 --> 39:18.860
Yes, Dr. Phil, get it!

39:18.860 --> 39:21.860
It seems this genre of content had given Dr. Phil a fresh wind,

39:21.860 --> 39:24.860
a relevance amongst a new generation of viewers who wanted to engage in that content.

39:24.860 --> 39:29.860
One of the greatest drawbacks to mainstream television is that many believe it doesn't appeal to younger people,

39:29.860 --> 39:32.860
and at the end of the day, they're the future older people.

39:32.860 --> 39:36.860
Yet less than half a year after Danielle Bregoli's first appearance,

39:36.860 --> 39:41.860
Dr. Phil enjoyed over 150 consecutive weeks at the top of the syndicated TV ratings,

39:41.860 --> 39:45.860
beating out Maury, Wendy Williams, and yes, Ellen.

39:45.860 --> 39:49.860
With this in mind, it's clear that Dr. Phil had captured the attention of a new cohort of viewers,

39:49.860 --> 39:54.860
and it wasn't long until he signed another contract extending the series until 2023.

39:54.860 --> 39:57.860
Everything was going right.

39:57.860 --> 40:06.860
Are you one of those parents who uses the TV as a babysitter? Next, a mom who can't...

40:09.860 --> 40:14.860
With the help of social media, Dr. Phil seemed to have pulled off one of the more impressive feats in television.

40:14.860 --> 40:18.860
He managed to make his content relevant to a new set of people, and it seemed they weren't going anywhere.

40:18.860 --> 40:22.860
He subsequently leaned into this reputation, appearing on a variety of internet shows,

40:22.860 --> 40:26.860
and even co-hosting PewDiePie's popular meme review series.

40:26.860 --> 40:28.860
Take it away, doctor.

40:28.860 --> 40:32.860
Hey everyone, it's Dr. Phil here, and I'm hosting Meme Review.

40:32.860 --> 40:36.860
It seems his stoic, tough love style had become beloved by a fresh demographic,

40:36.860 --> 40:39.860
all of whom had a platform to access this content freely.

40:39.860 --> 40:45.860
However, social media can go two ways, and as much as they may love you one day, they may hate you the next.

40:45.860 --> 40:48.860
Internet culture moves quickly, even more quickly these days in fact,

40:48.860 --> 40:53.860
and about as soon as Dr. Phil was popularized by the content he and others post online,

40:53.860 --> 40:57.860
more critical eyes were drawn towards him, finding a lot beneath the surface.

40:57.860 --> 41:03.860
It would be no surprise, given everything said thus far, that Dr. Phil wasn't without his enemies or his critics.

41:03.860 --> 41:08.860
In fact, he has been subject to severe criticism from medical professionals since the inception of his show.

41:08.860 --> 41:13.860
That can't be a surprise, really, given that his technique isn't actually one that's favored by most working in that profession.

41:13.860 --> 41:20.860
Every parent should know the warning signs. For the most violent of criminals, there are 14 traits of serial killers.

41:20.860 --> 41:27.860
Now meet parents terrified of their own young son who has 9 of the 14 traits.

41:27.860 --> 41:31.860
Criticism of Dr. Phil has been present since the show's launch in 2002.

41:31.860 --> 41:36.860
He was condemned by the National Alliance on Mental Illness after McGraw delivered a scathing public psychological analysis

41:36.860 --> 41:41.860
of a 9-year-old in 2004, with academic commentary on his techniques not exactly changing since.

41:41.860 --> 41:46.860
However, these narratives never had much impact because the majority of academics were on the fringe of popular culture at least,

41:46.860 --> 41:50.860
with many operating strictly within their fields. Ten different psychological boards could condemn you,

41:50.860 --> 41:53.860
and it wouldn't mean anything if they didn't receive any coverage.

41:53.860 --> 41:58.860
So while Dr. Phil primarily occupied the realms of television, he was mostly immune to such commentary and controversy.

41:58.860 --> 42:04.860
In spite of the numerous lawsuits and claims all the way up to 2017, you search Dr. Phil on the TV,

42:04.860 --> 42:09.860
and the only result you'll find is the big man himself. However, this isn't quite the case with online search engines,

42:09.860 --> 42:14.860
in particular YouTube, where Dr. Phil isn't the only person talking about Dr. Phil.

42:14.860 --> 42:20.860
Yes, you see, whereas previously the closest that most academics could get to having a public platform would be an opinion piece

42:20.860 --> 42:26.860
of the New York Times or an interview on MSNBC, there was now a whole website dedicated to allowing them to upload

42:26.860 --> 42:31.860
their thoughts on their specialist subjects. Now, like with any learned commentator, the trick is to make sure the topics

42:31.860 --> 42:36.860
you're talking about are somewhat relevant to the audience, and given that Dr. Phil was indeed very relevant,

42:36.860 --> 42:40.860
many began to open up discourse on his methods, and their success, or lack thereof.

42:40.860 --> 42:45.860
These took form of articles, YouTube videos, anything that gave an individual a way to express their feelings.

42:45.860 --> 42:51.860
So if Phil McGraw says it's not therapy, and he's not practicing any way, what is it?

42:51.860 --> 42:56.860
Kind of back to my original point, it's really just entertainment.

42:56.860 --> 43:03.860
All the seriousness with an insane amount of sound effects and transitions and just editorial nonsense.

43:03.860 --> 43:09.860
My whole life changed the day I met Jazz because she's the most spectacular woman I've ever met.

43:09.860 --> 43:14.860
It's no wonder people forget these are real human beings, the editing turns it all into a cartoon.

43:14.860 --> 43:20.860
Most of this began to circulate around the start of 2019. Funnily enough, this wasn't during any specific drama,

43:20.860 --> 43:25.860
more likely a product of Dr. Phil inertia, and the fact that people were growing more critical of prominent media

43:25.860 --> 43:30.860
figures in general. McGraw had always accepted that he was a bit of an outcast from the industry, but I do think these

43:30.860 --> 43:35.860
criticisms were somewhat contradictory to a lot of public opinion that had definitely heralded him as this universal

43:35.860 --> 43:39.860
problem solver, particularly that which questioned the general morals of the show.

43:39.860 --> 43:43.860
What did Dr. Phil have to offer other than an interesting premise for its time?

43:43.860 --> 43:46.860
Okay, it's good to meet you. Hi, it's nice to meet you too.

43:46.860 --> 43:51.860
Now, tell me what you mean when you say you're the reincarnation.

43:51.860 --> 43:59.860
Because Pocahontas was my 13th grade grandmother, but I'm sharing her soul in my body.

43:59.860 --> 44:04.860
So you can feel her presence in you? Yeah.

44:04.860 --> 44:08.860
It's difficult being any sort of public figure and dealing with issues that are often deeply personal.

44:08.860 --> 44:13.860
You're handling sensitive information, and one of the drawbacks of Dr. Phil's show is that no matter how good he could

44:13.860 --> 44:17.860
have hypothetically been, the program was still designed to bring about drama, even if he wasn't.

44:17.860 --> 44:22.860
And people began to pick up on that. Television and therapy have always seemed somewhat opposed to each other.

44:22.860 --> 44:26.860
Although it's important that there are people prepared to be open about their struggles to help others,

44:26.860 --> 44:31.860
it's still a subject that needs to be handled with sensitivity and care, and given the fact that some of these people

44:31.860 --> 44:36.860
were not even on the show by their own volition, particularly children who were likely brought on by their parents,

44:36.860 --> 44:42.860
it's hard to see the benefit that was derived. Simply put, you wouldn't see this sort of drama in a private therapy room

44:42.860 --> 44:47.860
because TV cameras and the presence of a large public audience always encourages people to act more defensive,

44:47.860 --> 44:49.860
and even aggressive.

44:49.860 --> 44:54.860
Now I have a career and I'm famous. That's what happens when you get famous, you cut people off.

44:54.860 --> 45:16.860
Everyone's upset with it, maybe because you guys aren't relevant either, so you don't understand.

45:16.860 --> 45:20.860
Some people began to ask, why is this TV at all? And I think it's a potent question.

45:20.860 --> 45:25.860
Probably the easiest answer is simple, that being of entertainment, and obviously that's important as it drives

45:25.860 --> 45:30.860
the core appeal of a lot of modern TV, having it can't be the only reason when there are other ethical queries

45:30.860 --> 45:35.860
surrounding the subject. The Hunger Games is pretty entertaining for a lot of people, but there's also a reason why it's fictional.

45:35.860 --> 45:42.860
Dr. Phil can showcase people at their weakest and most vulnerable, and although it's often used to drive home a positive message,

45:42.860 --> 45:47.860
what sacrifice to a person's privacy and individual healing process is made to achieve that?

45:47.860 --> 45:54.860
Sure, Dr. Phil raises awareness, but at what cost? A lot of people clearly had it in their head that there was some mutual benefit,

45:54.860 --> 46:00.860
coming on Dr. Phil was meant to be helpful, but the only people it was guaranteed to benefit were some viewers and the show itself.

46:00.860 --> 46:06.860
I think the audience's self-assurance that Dr. Phil offered some unique brand of assistance was really meant to mask the fact that people

46:06.860 --> 46:12.860
love to watch a car crash. There's a reason why the most successful Dr. Phil videos are the ones with the most heated confrontations.

46:12.860 --> 46:18.860
These videos all likely staying on YouTube for the rest of eternity, showing the behaviour of some extremely troubled people.

46:18.860 --> 46:24.860
Sure, Dr. Phil was better than his trash TV contemporaries, but that didn't exactly make him a force for good,

46:24.860 --> 46:30.860
and with his greater presence online, it also made it easier to reach with such criticisms, and many did just that.

46:30.860 --> 46:35.860
So with all these different points in mind, both the positive and the negative, my question would be,

46:35.860 --> 46:39.860
why would anyone believe that Phil McGraw knows something special?

46:39.860 --> 46:44.860
Many began to wonder what Dr. Phil was offering his guests that couldn't be offered elsewhere.

46:44.860 --> 46:49.860
Well, I suppose the one thing was that any sort of treatment was not cheap in a place like the United States,

46:49.860 --> 46:53.860
and Dr. Phil did offer a space for that, at the price of a bit of TV time.

46:53.860 --> 46:59.860
Additionally, the therapy doesn't end on the Dr. Phil show, many would attest that he provides help beyond their TV appearance,

46:59.860 --> 47:04.860
and for the children who McGraw felt were facing the most significant challenges, they would have an all-expenses-paid trip

47:04.860 --> 47:08.860
to Turnabout Ranch, that was designed to help put kids on the right path.

47:08.860 --> 47:13.860
Dr. Phil did offer something different to everyone else, and just because a person doesn't derive benefit,

47:13.860 --> 47:19.860
doesn't mean the formula in place can't help a majority of people, does it?

47:25.860 --> 47:30.860
Okay, let's say the concept behind Dr. Phil is inherently flawed, there was no way that a show like this could possibly work

47:30.860 --> 47:33.860
in favour of every guest because of how the public spotlight affects you.

47:33.860 --> 47:39.860
It would be fair to question its status on the principal alone, but is it fair to tar the entire show with the critical brush?

47:39.860 --> 47:44.860
The least that some would argue is that McGraw and the producers involved did their best to mitigate the negative impact

47:44.860 --> 47:47.860
that may be drawn towards individuals who were involved with the show.

47:48.860 --> 47:56.860
I'm not here to judge you, I'm here to help you. I'm here to help you.

47:56.860 --> 48:04.860
I'm here to do what your husband should have done all along the way, and that is to lead you out of this quagmire and into the light.

48:04.860 --> 48:09.860
Dr. Phil himself was often outspoken in making sure people knew the help an individual would be receiving,

48:09.860 --> 48:15.860
and like a lot of shows, conducted segments that revisited former participants to assess how their lives had changed since then.

48:15.860 --> 48:16.860
So how are you doing?

48:16.860 --> 48:21.860
Doing good, I am four months clean and sober for everything.

48:23.860 --> 48:24.860
So glad to hear that.

48:24.860 --> 48:32.860
It just puts courage and strength, and finally love myself, because you helped me figure that out.

48:32.860 --> 48:35.860
Like, being able to do that has changed my life.

48:35.860 --> 48:40.860
It seemed that the consensus from a lot of guests was broadly positive, and that their appearance on Dr. Phil had prompted

48:40.860 --> 48:44.860
many of them to begin turning their lives around. It likely made viewers feel good about themselves,

48:44.860 --> 48:50.860
but as people began to dig, they realised that this outlook wasn't quite as universal as it was portrayed on TV,

48:50.860 --> 48:54.860
with some even suggesting that there had been serious failures regarding the safeguarding of guests.

48:54.860 --> 48:59.860
As noted, there have been several lawsuits and allegations that were published during the lifespan of the show,

48:59.860 --> 49:05.860
but as always, the problem with these is that when they're isolated, they're typically not high-profile enough to attract attention from the public.

49:05.860 --> 49:09.860
However, when they can all be lined up in one place, a much clearer pattern can be established,

49:09.860 --> 49:12.860
and greater narratives can be expounded on the matter.

49:12.860 --> 49:17.860
With Dr. Phil under the spotlight as a whole, and the online world making it easier to access such information,

49:17.860 --> 49:21.860
it wasn't long until people began picking apart the show's wholesome veneer.

49:21.860 --> 49:26.860
The first aspect to go under the microscope was how the show managed the handling of its guests on air.

49:26.860 --> 49:33.860
Dr. Phil and the producers always made a point about the show being a safe space for an individual to speak openly about their trials and their trauma.

49:33.860 --> 49:37.860
However, some have begun to question whether that was truly the case in the last few years,

49:37.860 --> 49:40.860
or if chasing a story was more important to the people in question.

49:41.860 --> 49:45.860
I must know why you and my step-sisters treat me with such contempt.

49:45.860 --> 49:50.860
You know, I try to be kind and forgiving, but the nicer I am, the worse you treat me.

49:50.860 --> 49:57.860
This is Shelley Duvall. A few decades ago, she was an A-list celebrity who had a successful and lucrative career in film and television.

49:57.860 --> 50:03.860
However, in 2002, she retired from acting and decided to live a life away from the limelight, making very few public appearances.

50:03.860 --> 50:09.860
Yet, in 2016, that changed, when she agreed to be interviewed by McGraw for an episode of Dr. Phil.

50:09.860 --> 50:12.860
What followed next was... something else.

50:12.860 --> 50:21.860
It's very confusing, very disturbing to me, because they started out with Ground Zero and Triple Zero.

50:21.860 --> 50:29.860
It's like when a nun at some place tells you, you're almost Triple Zero, and she meant it!

50:29.860 --> 50:36.860
And, anyway, everybody was already listening in on me, even from Santa Monica.

50:36.860 --> 50:41.860
I should go without saying that what Duvall was experiencing was a serious episode of a mental breakdown,

50:41.860 --> 50:47.860
and she was in a clearly compromised state, to which it would be questionable whether she could even understand what was happening in that moment.

50:47.860 --> 50:54.860
Throughout the interview, McGraw continuously encourages and attempts to aid Duvall in finding help, for which Duvall seems incredibly reluctant.

50:54.860 --> 51:05.860
I want to check everything out. I want to make sure that you're healthy, and that you're feeling right, thinking right, sleeping right, eating right.

51:05.860 --> 51:08.860
Do you take any medication?

51:08.860 --> 51:17.860
No. Will you quit trying to pin me with... She's a heavy drinker? She takes pills?

51:17.860 --> 51:21.860
Sit in your head. Come on, I see the V at the top there.

51:21.860 --> 51:22.860
Yeah, I got a bald head.

51:22.860 --> 51:23.860
That's a goose.

51:23.860 --> 51:28.860
You see, the reason I want to get you checked out is because...

51:28.860 --> 51:29.860
They're not tourniquets.

51:29.860 --> 51:42.860
If your hair is thinning, and you're feeling pain, I want to help you. I want to get you to some doctors that can really check you out.

51:42.860 --> 51:45.860
It's a physical problem. Physical.

51:45.860 --> 51:46.860
I want to check you out physically.

51:46.860 --> 51:50.860
And I don't want any more B-Bites, because they threaten me, but I'm not afraid of them.

51:51.860 --> 51:57.860
I'm not going to focus on this interview too much, but it caught the attention of some high profile figures, including Stanley Kubrick's daughter,

51:57.860 --> 52:02.860
and actress Maya Farrow, who both criticised the broadcast of someone clearly at such a vulnerable point in their life.

52:02.860 --> 52:05.860
I think, however, it was more indicative of the show.

52:05.860 --> 52:10.860
Shelly, listen to me. Will you let me get you to some doctors?

52:11.860 --> 52:13.860
I was a pretty girl. I was beautiful.

52:13.860 --> 52:20.860
I was 1987 Entertainer of the Year for the Southern California Cable Television Association.

52:20.860 --> 52:22.860
Will you let me get you to some doctors?

52:22.860 --> 52:24.860
Not as a prisoner, you're not.

52:24.860 --> 52:27.860
Of course not. You can come and go anytime you want.

52:27.860 --> 52:30.860
What was wrong with the doctors I had?

52:30.860 --> 52:32.860
We haven't seen doctors for a good while.

52:32.860 --> 52:35.860
But I'd rather see my doctor than your doctor.

52:35.860 --> 52:38.860
Well, but I've got some really good doctors.

52:38.860 --> 52:39.860
You do?

52:40.860 --> 52:41.860
Yeah. Can I fix this?

52:41.860 --> 52:47.860
I don't know if McGraw is charging by the hour, but this interview almost seems too motivated to get Shelly help,

52:47.860 --> 52:51.860
and I use the quotation marks there, because help is subjective depending on the person.

52:51.860 --> 52:54.860
What might help one person isn't guaranteed to help another person.

52:54.860 --> 52:59.860
Throughout the interview, Dr Phil seems determined to get Duval to this one centre in particular,

52:59.860 --> 53:03.860
which ultimately fails because once she's there, Duval is not comfortable receiving help there,

53:03.860 --> 53:06.860
and at the end of the episode, he reveals that they're supporting her at home anyway.

53:06.860 --> 53:10.860
Dr Phil runs through a manual that dictates operations regardless of the individual,

53:10.860 --> 53:16.860
it's manufactured to maintain those narratives, but what happens when that aspect is pushed to obsessive degrees?

53:16.860 --> 53:23.860
There have been a couple of instances in the past where the producers of Dr Phil were accused of facilitating people's problems rather than helping them.

53:23.860 --> 53:27.860
In 2008, a member of the Dr Phil team was caught paying towards a violent teen's bail,

53:27.860 --> 53:30.860
and although they subsequently cancelled the story, let's be frank here,

53:30.860 --> 53:33.860
it was no secret the lengths the show would go to to get a scoop.

53:33.860 --> 53:39.860
Yet another high profile case seemed to take the biscuit, and it once again involved another public figure.

53:39.860 --> 53:44.860
This is Todd Herzog, he was the victor of the 15th season of Survivor, set in China.

53:44.860 --> 53:51.860
However, after his success, he had struggled with alcoholism, during which his mother had contacted Dr Phil for help with her son's problem.

53:51.860 --> 53:55.860
However, when he turned up to the studio, he was intoxicated to the point of incomprehension.

53:55.860 --> 53:59.860
McGraw was sure to bring attention to this and the serious danger he was in.

53:59.860 --> 54:09.860
So yeah, I'm okay, because I didn't know this was happening right now.

54:09.860 --> 54:12.860
You're not okay?

54:12.860 --> 54:13.860
No.

54:13.860 --> 54:17.860
You said you're okay, but you're not okay. You're not even almost okay.

54:17.860 --> 54:18.860
No.

54:18.860 --> 54:19.860
Do you know who I am?

54:19.860 --> 54:22.860
Yeah, of course I know who you are.

54:22.860 --> 54:35.860
You are here, because I wanted to talk to you, because in my opinion, you're killing yourself, man.

54:35.860 --> 54:43.860
I want to get a fix on you right now, so I know what I'm dealing with. This is a breathalyzer.

54:43.860 --> 54:50.860
I want you to blow into it really hard for five seconds when I tell you, so I can see where you are.

54:50.860 --> 54:55.860
Once again, after a brief consultation, Dr Phil emphasizes how he's going to find him help, and to be fair,

54:55.860 --> 54:59.860
in this case, it's probably not the wrong sort of help, and after receiving treatment,

54:59.860 --> 55:04.860
Todd makes his appearance on the show as a sober individual and expresses his gratitude for the intervention.

55:04.860 --> 55:10.860
However, a couple years later, in 2016, he appears on the show once more after relapsing.

55:11.860 --> 55:18.860
At 2.30 this morning, you had a blood alcohol level of 0.432.

55:20.860 --> 55:21.860
Yeah.

55:22.860 --> 55:23.860
And?

55:23.860 --> 55:29.860
One week squared is 0.601.

55:30.860 --> 55:32.860
That's...

55:32.860 --> 55:33.860
Death.

55:33.860 --> 55:34.860
That's death.

55:34.860 --> 55:35.860
That's death.

55:35.860 --> 55:39.860
It's always somewhat tragic to see a person struggling so much on live TV.

55:39.860 --> 55:45.860
However, in 2017, Herzog went public with the claim that his struggle had been orchestrated by the Dr Phil producers,

55:45.860 --> 55:49.860
who planned a bottle of vodka in his dressing room during both interventions.

55:49.860 --> 55:54.860
I show up to the studios, and I'm sober, I'm hurting a lot, and I'm shaking.

55:54.860 --> 55:58.860
My dad was there, and I went and talked to him in his dressing room, and I was completely sober.

55:58.860 --> 56:06.860
And then they pull me into my dressing room, and there was two liters of vodka and, like, some Red Bulls and orange juice and stuff like that.

56:06.860 --> 56:13.860
You know, being unsupervised by my parents, I drank the entire bottle.

56:15.860 --> 56:17.860
And then at some point, somebody gave me a Xanax.

56:17.860 --> 56:19.860
They said, this will calm your nerves.

56:19.860 --> 56:25.860
And so I had been drinking and took a Xanax, which I've never taken Xanax before in my life,

56:26.860 --> 56:30.860
and I know that can be a deadly combination, so why it was given to me, I don't know.

56:30.860 --> 56:35.860
I get that it's a television show, and that they want to show the pain that I'm in.

56:35.860 --> 56:40.860
However, what would have happened if I died there, you know?

56:40.860 --> 56:44.860
This seemed to paint a very different portrait than the one that was perceived,

56:44.860 --> 56:51.860
and in both cases of Devana Herzog seemed to tell us something extremely different about the intent of McGraw and those around him.

56:56.860 --> 57:02.860
The irony is that perfect television is often the moments that probably shouldn't even be there.

57:02.860 --> 57:07.860
People want something that is raw and real, and often that can't happen naturally in front of a TV camera.

57:07.860 --> 57:09.860
So when it does, it's all the more powerful.

57:09.860 --> 57:14.860
In the case of Herzog and De Waal, what we saw were two people who were clearly suffering from something serious,

57:14.860 --> 57:17.860
and its coverage, for many, was extremely riveting.

57:17.860 --> 57:21.860
However, in both cases, it's fair to question how fair it truly was.

57:22.860 --> 57:25.860
Is this going to be a murder? Are you going to murder me?

57:25.860 --> 57:30.860
This looks deserted. Leave me alone. I don't want to be murdered.

57:30.860 --> 57:32.860
We would never murder you.

57:32.860 --> 57:35.860
You stop driving, and I'm going to have a cigarette.

57:35.860 --> 57:38.860
Fire hazard area, no fire hazard area.

57:38.860 --> 57:43.860
If you're smoke-enders, Patrick Reynolds warned me about you.

57:43.860 --> 57:48.860
In the case of De Waal, trying to ship her off to some facility that may not have been suitable for her problems,

57:48.860 --> 57:52.860
and in the case of Herzog, allegedly exploiting a vulnerability for drama.

57:52.860 --> 57:55.860
And although I cannot comment for certain on the verity of the claim,

57:55.860 --> 57:59.860
is it not suspicious that despite being surrounded by a full TV crew,

57:59.860 --> 58:01.860
a family who probably didn't want him to consume alcohol,

58:01.860 --> 58:04.860
and experts who were supposedly worried for his health,

58:04.860 --> 58:06.860
that he still turned up drunk?

58:06.860 --> 58:09.860
I understand if you can't completely control a person,

58:09.860 --> 58:12.860
but if the safeguarding measures were up to scratch,

58:12.860 --> 58:15.860
like producers had claimed in other interviews surrounding this matter,

58:15.860 --> 58:18.860
there is no way he should have arrived at that studio intoxicated,

58:18.860 --> 58:20.860
and yet it happened twice.

58:20.860 --> 58:23.860
In both of these high-profile situations,

58:23.860 --> 58:27.860
it seems the authenticity was merely a front for something more manufactured,

58:27.860 --> 58:31.860
a conflict that wasn't necessary for the discourse that everyone seemed so concerned about,

58:31.860 --> 58:34.860
but more so allowed producers to raise stakes in dramatic narratives

58:34.860 --> 58:38.860
that emphasised the urgency of the situations that these guests found themselves in,

58:38.860 --> 58:42.860
and to be honest, if McGraw hadn't landed himself in the controversy while consulting Britney,

58:42.860 --> 58:45.860
the producers may well have done a similar thing with her.

58:45.860 --> 58:49.860
Dr. Phil's handling of high-profile individuals was what initially drew the most controversy,

58:49.860 --> 58:54.860
after all, they're the ones who most often have a platform to speak out if they experience maltreatment,

58:54.860 --> 58:57.860
however, as with other situations I acknowledged earlier,

58:57.860 --> 58:59.860
it's very hard to say how far this went back,

58:59.860 --> 59:02.860
and it's doubtful that it was an isolated incident,

59:02.860 --> 59:04.860
and other stories suggested they weren't.

59:04.860 --> 59:08.860
I thought Dr. Phil was gonna save my daughter, and it did not happen.

59:08.860 --> 59:11.860
This is Joelle, she's a mother who brought her pregnant daughter on the show

59:11.860 --> 59:14.860
to hopefully get some help for her heroin addiction.

59:14.860 --> 59:16.860
She claims she was promised round-the-clock supervision,

59:16.860 --> 59:20.860
however, when her daughter began to detox, she didn't receive that.

59:26.860 --> 59:31.860
After about four hours, Caitlin decided that she was gonna leave,

59:31.860 --> 59:36.860
and we needed to go to get her something so that she would not withdraw

59:36.860 --> 59:38.860
because it would hurt the baby at that point.

59:38.860 --> 59:42.860
Not receiving help for four hours at a hospital and fearing for the safety of the baby,

59:42.860 --> 59:46.860
Joelle felt she had no other option but to get her daughter immediately from heroin,

59:46.860 --> 59:51.860
at which point they were transported to Skid Row with the camera person who filmed the entire ordeal.

59:51.860 --> 59:53.860
They're arriving now.

59:58.860 --> 01:00:00.860
Care to death right now.

01:00:00.860 --> 01:00:02.860
Caitlin made a contact very quickly,

01:00:02.860 --> 01:00:05.860
I gave her money, and she went on her way.

01:00:05.860 --> 01:00:09.860
Approximately 30-45 minutes later, we found her.

01:00:09.860 --> 01:00:14.860
She was happy, high, and we went back to the hotel at that point.

01:00:14.860 --> 01:00:16.860
This was subsequently brought up on the show,

01:00:16.860 --> 01:00:20.860
where McGraw chastises the mother for leaving the hospital and heading to Skid Row,

01:00:20.860 --> 01:00:22.860
which, obviously, is not a safe place.

01:00:22.860 --> 01:00:26.860
You think since her mom is a nurse, she would take her to the hospital,

01:00:26.860 --> 01:00:28.860
but instead, they made a drug run.

01:00:28.860 --> 01:00:31.860
I just wanted to help her feel better.

01:00:31.860 --> 01:00:34.860
So that baby is high on heroin right now.

01:00:34.860 --> 01:00:38.860
I can't alert LAPD before you walk off of this stage.

01:00:38.860 --> 01:00:41.860
So you think forcing someone to get help like that is the best way?

01:00:41.860 --> 01:00:44.860
I don't give a... what you think.

01:00:44.860 --> 01:00:46.860
I'm concerned about your baby.

01:00:46.860 --> 01:00:50.860
In this case, though, the mother claims she was cornered with how to treat the situation,

01:00:50.860 --> 01:00:53.860
and told that if she had questioned aspects of the show that had caused her to take such measures,

01:00:53.860 --> 01:00:56.860
her daughter wouldn't be able to receive the help that she needed.

01:00:56.860 --> 01:01:00.860
There was a lot of manipulation, telling us what to say,

01:01:00.860 --> 01:01:03.860
telling us how to act, telling us what to do.

01:01:03.860 --> 01:01:06.860
I don't have an answer for why I did what I did.

01:01:06.860 --> 01:01:08.860
I just wanted to help her feel better.

01:01:08.860 --> 01:01:11.860
I was told, do not question anything he's saying,

01:01:11.860 --> 01:01:14.860
or he could not give her the help that she needed.

01:01:14.860 --> 01:01:18.860
How much is going to have to be lost before you pull your head?

01:01:18.860 --> 01:01:19.860
This is it.

01:01:19.860 --> 01:01:22.860
I'm not going to mince my words here.

01:01:22.860 --> 01:01:23.860
That's a threat.

01:01:23.860 --> 01:01:25.860
There is no two ways about it.

01:01:25.860 --> 01:01:26.860
This person isn't a celebrity.

01:01:26.860 --> 01:01:28.860
They're not copiously wealthy.

01:01:28.860 --> 01:01:31.860
What Dr. Phil is offering these people is a chance to receive serious help,

01:01:31.860 --> 01:01:36.860
to hold that over someone's head if they don't comply with your request to make sure Phillip's reputation

01:01:36.860 --> 01:01:38.860
remains unscathed is extremely inhumane.

01:01:38.860 --> 01:01:40.860
Now, once again, this is just an allegation,

01:01:40.860 --> 01:01:45.860
but it certainly fits in with this idea that the producers were chasing a story and a reputation,

01:01:45.860 --> 01:01:49.860
rather than prioritising the help they often advocated for on the show.

01:01:49.860 --> 01:01:53.860
In the case of Joelle and her daughter, even if it didn't happen exactly as reported,

01:01:53.860 --> 01:01:56.860
they were still escorted to skid row with a cameraman.

01:01:56.860 --> 01:02:00.860
If there was proper medical supervision like the Dr. Phil show claimed,

01:02:00.860 --> 01:02:02.860
how the hell did they end up there?

01:02:02.860 --> 01:02:07.860
Responding to the claims, Martin Greenberg, a psychologist who is head of the show's personal affairs,

01:02:07.860 --> 01:02:13.860
stated that officials only agreed to do the show if Joelle agreed to be responsible for her daughter's withdrawal,

01:02:13.860 --> 01:02:15.860
which seems really weird from my perspective.

01:02:15.860 --> 01:02:17.860
Surely that's what the medical professionals would be for,

01:02:17.860 --> 01:02:21.860
and if you think someone is at any risk, you wouldn't bring them down at all.

01:02:21.860 --> 01:02:26.860
Washing your hands of contractual culpability doesn't suddenly absolve you of any moral obligation.

01:02:26.860 --> 01:02:31.860
Maybe as an entertainer that's a risk you would take, but certainly not as a person whose job is to keep people safe.

01:02:31.860 --> 01:02:35.860
As a head of personal affairs, Greenberg is surprisingly bad at PR,

01:02:35.860 --> 01:02:40.860
including providing seemingly confused and conflicting responses to claims about patient safeguarding.

01:02:40.860 --> 01:02:45.860
Most of his responses reek of arrogance and dismissiveness towards the complaints they've been receiving,

01:02:45.860 --> 01:02:49.860
though I'll give them credit because they do still emphasise personal responsibility.

01:02:49.860 --> 01:02:53.860
In saying that these people are not willing to take responsibility for themselves,

01:02:53.860 --> 01:02:56.860
I think it would be valid to flip the question in this case, and say,

01:02:56.860 --> 01:02:59.860
is it not them who are not willing to take responsibility?

01:02:59.860 --> 01:03:04.860
In attempting to explain why they may not be aware of whether a guest is at risk from their cravings,

01:03:04.860 --> 01:03:07.860
Greenberg states, and I love this one,

01:03:07.860 --> 01:03:10.860
addicts are notorious for lying, deflecting, and trivialising,

01:03:10.860 --> 01:03:14.860
but if they are at risk when they arrive, then they were at risk before they arrived.

01:03:14.860 --> 01:03:19.860
I've been trying to save the opinion part for later, but this is just such a rotten thing to say.

01:03:19.860 --> 01:03:23.860
Sure, sometimes addicts struggle with being open about their problems,

01:03:23.860 --> 01:03:27.860
but the fact they came to your show probably means they want help,

01:03:27.860 --> 01:03:29.860
and it doesn't mean they're not deserving of it.

01:03:29.860 --> 01:03:35.860
For you to make a general ad hominem attack to deflect responsibility from the show is cowardly,

01:03:35.860 --> 01:03:38.860
and I would expect better from a psychologist.

01:03:38.860 --> 01:03:42.860
If you're aware of that behaviour, then surely that is reason for you to heighten the supervision,

01:03:42.860 --> 01:03:46.860
not just leave them to their own devices and then shrug your shoulders.

01:03:46.860 --> 01:03:51.860
The Dr Phil show cannot guarantee the eternal safety of all who attend their show,

01:03:51.860 --> 01:03:54.860
however, they could at least ensure it on the premises.

01:03:54.860 --> 01:03:58.860
Instead, guests turned up drunk, trips to Skid Row were made with a camera crew,

01:03:58.860 --> 01:04:03.860
and the narrative of help was pushed to nauseating and even allegedly threatening degrees.

01:04:03.860 --> 01:04:09.860
Sure, it was perfect TV, but what was happening behind the cameras?

01:04:09.860 --> 01:04:12.860
How truly helpful was that help?

01:04:40.860 --> 01:04:42.860
There is no but.

01:04:42.860 --> 01:04:48.860
You either want the help or you don't, and if you want the help, you lean into it,

01:04:48.860 --> 01:04:51.860
and you don't get back here. There's no pass and go.

01:04:51.860 --> 01:04:54.860
You leave from here to there.

01:04:54.860 --> 01:04:58.860
That requires very specialized care that I think you deserve.

01:04:58.860 --> 01:05:02.860
I want you to have that help. I want this baby to have that help.

01:05:02.860 --> 01:05:09.860
I am offering you the best help, in my opinion, in the United States.

01:05:09.860 --> 01:05:11.860
Right.

01:05:11.860 --> 01:05:13.860
And...

01:05:13.860 --> 01:05:15.860
Please.

01:05:15.860 --> 01:05:17.860
But...

01:05:17.860 --> 01:05:19.860
Just say yes.

01:05:19.860 --> 01:05:20.860
Stop talking to me.

01:05:20.860 --> 01:05:23.860
I'm not here to be unfair or ignore the greater picture,

01:05:23.860 --> 01:05:27.860
and I do want to acknowledge that there are plenty of people who will credit the Dr Phil show

01:05:27.860 --> 01:05:29.860
for the difference it has made in their lives.

01:05:29.860 --> 01:05:32.860
In discussing the subject of antics on the show, Greenberg says,

01:05:32.860 --> 01:05:35.860
the only change is they are one step closer to getting help,

01:05:35.860 --> 01:05:38.860
typically help they could not even come close to affording.

01:05:38.860 --> 01:05:42.860
Greenberg presents the help the show is offering as a privilege.

01:05:42.860 --> 01:05:48.860
Now, I know the health system is pretty broken, and that in many ways, it is a privilege to be seen so quickly.

01:05:48.860 --> 01:05:50.860
With that said, it's a mutual thing.

01:05:50.860 --> 01:05:53.860
Greenberg speaks like it's an act of charity,

01:05:53.860 --> 01:05:57.860
but really, it's the least they can do for people who have fueled their daytime ratings.

01:05:57.860 --> 01:06:02.860
In defending the show, Greenberg admits that appearing on Dr Phil is a step towards receiving the assistance

01:06:02.860 --> 01:06:05.860
many typically desire to conquer their demons,

01:06:05.860 --> 01:06:07.860
but Dr Phil isn't the endgame, he's the middleman,

01:06:07.860 --> 01:06:12.860
and the success of the TV show has given them the power to also find treatment for their subject.

01:06:12.860 --> 01:06:16.860
Now though, to touch on the fact that healthcare on this front can be very expensive,

01:06:16.860 --> 01:06:19.860
as Greenberg acknowledges, there is a financial factor behind the show,

01:06:19.860 --> 01:06:23.860
and Dr Phil has never really ran on a patient-based formula.

01:06:23.860 --> 01:06:28.860
Yes my friends, there is a mystery third beneficiary to the sort of service being offered by Dr Phil,

01:06:28.860 --> 01:06:31.860
that being the treatment facilities that these people are sent to,

01:06:31.860 --> 01:06:35.860
many of whom advertise their relationship with the esteemed Dr Phil.

01:06:35.860 --> 01:06:40.860
If certain people can afford it, these places have just been given the promotion for the help they offer.

01:06:40.860 --> 01:06:45.860
When a guest comes on, Dr Phil will sometimes express to the viewers exactly what treatment facility

01:06:45.860 --> 01:06:49.860
that person is being sent to, and the positive difference that it will make.

01:06:49.860 --> 01:06:54.860
Such promotions are like a sponsorship really, and many media and even YouTube figures do sponsorships

01:06:54.860 --> 01:06:58.860
with some very curious companies, and most of us know that we need to take them with a grain of salt.

01:06:58.860 --> 01:07:02.860
Dr Phil, like many people, is a guy who is attempting to acquire the bag,

01:07:02.860 --> 01:07:05.860
and honestly, there are worse things that he could promote.

01:07:05.860 --> 01:07:10.860
If you're looking for something to do that's fun, relaxing, and good for your brain,

01:07:10.860 --> 01:07:16.860
I have a perfect way for you to take a much needed break, and it's right on your phone for free.

01:07:17.860 --> 01:07:20.860
It's an app game called Solitaire Grand Harvest.

01:07:20.860 --> 01:07:25.860
Now, I have two guests here who say they play and love this game.

01:07:25.860 --> 01:07:29.860
At the same time, such an endorsement does come with a degree of responsibility,

01:07:29.860 --> 01:07:32.860
especially given the sensitive subjects that are often handled.

01:07:32.860 --> 01:07:35.860
Was that due diligence being performed?

01:07:35.860 --> 01:07:38.860
Well, the show seems to have agreements with a few facilities for treatment,

01:07:38.860 --> 01:07:41.860
which Dr Phil of course sings his praises about,

01:07:41.860 --> 01:07:47.860
but maybe they're perfectly qualified people, but there is a quite close relationship between Dr Phil and a lot of these places.

01:07:47.860 --> 01:07:52.860
Now, one size never fits all, and there will always be people who will not find recovery in a treatment center,

01:07:52.860 --> 01:07:57.860
and although I think there have been instances where McGraw was a little too enthusiastic about specific clinics,

01:07:57.860 --> 01:08:02.860
see Duval, I understand that having a close relationship with specific places is probably for the best,

01:08:02.860 --> 01:08:05.860
as it would allow one to maintain the highest quality of treatment.

01:08:05.860 --> 01:08:07.860
However, was that high quality being delivered?

01:08:07.860 --> 01:08:10.860
The problem is that once you tie yourself to specific institutions,

01:08:10.860 --> 01:08:14.860
if the reputations of these places do come under scrutiny, it can reflect on you,

01:08:14.860 --> 01:08:17.860
even if you're not involved in the management of the facility itself.

01:08:17.860 --> 01:08:21.860
Obviously, there are factors that people can't be expected to be aware of,

01:08:21.860 --> 01:08:24.860
yet over time, some believe this should have been fairly obvious.

01:08:24.860 --> 01:08:27.860
Dr Lawless, stand up, would you please?

01:08:27.860 --> 01:08:31.860
This is Dr Frank Lawless, head of the Psychoneuroplasticity Center,

01:08:31.860 --> 01:08:36.860
which is a long, long way of saying they check people from A to Z.

01:08:36.860 --> 01:08:41.860
The first query that one may raise is the actual suitability of many of these facilities for Dr Phil.

01:08:41.860 --> 01:08:45.860
Now, McGraw hails from Texas, and many of his connections are from around that area,

01:08:45.860 --> 01:08:51.860
such as the origins clinic, and the arbor, both of whom have facilities in Big Philly's home states.

01:08:51.860 --> 01:08:56.860
Greenberg states that if a person requires medical attention, they will fly in the required medical personnel,

01:08:56.860 --> 01:08:58.860
however, there seems to be a bit of disconnect with this system.

01:08:58.860 --> 01:09:04.860
Although Herzog received his treatment from the arbor, Steve Thomason, who is the director of the facility,

01:09:04.860 --> 01:09:08.860
has stated that Herzog did not and could not have received supervision on the show from them,

01:09:08.860 --> 01:09:10.860
because they're not licensed in California.

01:09:10.860 --> 01:09:14.860
In fact, Thomason states he completely regrets agreeing to working with the show in the first place,

01:09:14.860 --> 01:09:17.860
and was so upset by the segment that he never agreed to work with them again.

01:09:17.860 --> 01:09:19.860
This doesn't mean that Herzog wasn't supervised,

01:09:19.860 --> 01:09:25.860
but it certainly created a disconnect between two entities that should be laboring towards a collective goal.

01:09:25.860 --> 01:09:28.860
If a company is required to regularly supervise individuals in California,

01:09:28.860 --> 01:09:31.860
should they not be licensed to do so in that state as well?

01:09:31.860 --> 01:09:33.860
Are there not more suitable alternatives?

01:09:33.860 --> 01:09:35.860
I want to introduce someone to you.

01:09:35.860 --> 01:09:37.860
This is Mike Gurr down here.

01:09:37.860 --> 01:09:39.860
He's the executive director at the Meadows Ranch,

01:09:39.860 --> 01:09:47.860
and I've asked him to come here today because I've worked with Meadows for years,

01:09:47.860 --> 01:09:50.860
and they, in my opinion, are the best of the best,

01:09:50.860 --> 01:09:55.860
and I wanted you to have an opportunity to sit down and talk with them

01:09:56.860 --> 01:10:03.860
and see if you feel like this might be a good opportunity for you.

01:10:03.860 --> 01:10:08.860
You can't exactly blame Dr. Phil for involving prior business relationships in his present day ventures,

01:10:08.860 --> 01:10:11.860
especially if he holds them in higher regard like he regularly claims he does.

01:10:11.860 --> 01:10:15.860
However, business shouldn't really be the central matter of the TV show,

01:10:15.860 --> 01:10:17.860
yet that's what some believed it to be,

01:10:17.860 --> 01:10:20.860
particularly given Dr. Phil's presence as a brand.

01:10:20.860 --> 01:10:23.860
The Boston Globe, who had published some of the most critical content of McGraw

01:10:23.860 --> 01:10:27.860
during his social media renaissance, touched on this in a 2017 article

01:10:27.860 --> 01:10:32.860
when covering the recent Dr. Phil path to recovery VR headset marketing shebang.

01:10:32.860 --> 01:10:38.860
You're going to see on the screens what Eric is seeing in the goggles.

01:10:38.860 --> 01:10:40.860
Now, this is prerecorded.

01:10:40.860 --> 01:10:43.860
Okay, Eric, look up.

01:10:43.860 --> 01:10:45.860
Now look to your left.

01:10:45.860 --> 01:10:47.860
This is what he's seeing.

01:10:47.860 --> 01:10:51.860
Now, what I've done here is I've put them in a bar situation.

01:10:51.860 --> 01:10:54.860
So while they're in rehab, they're sitting talking to me in a bar.

01:10:54.860 --> 01:10:57.860
Now they're sitting and this is actually in my backyard.

01:10:57.860 --> 01:11:02.860
The Dr. Phil path to recovery VR headset is a system that supposedly aids addicts

01:11:02.860 --> 01:11:04.860
with an interactive form of therapy with the man himself.

01:11:04.860 --> 01:11:06.860
Although admittedly hard to establish,

01:11:06.860 --> 01:11:10.860
there is no epidemiological evidence to show that it is successful,

01:11:10.860 --> 01:11:13.860
but the Boston Globe claimed that there was one distinctive benefit,

01:11:13.860 --> 01:11:15.860
that being the Dr. Phil namesake.

01:11:15.860 --> 01:11:18.860
In reports, one potential client had informed the publication

01:11:18.860 --> 01:11:21.860
that the selling point presented to them had been just that,

01:11:21.860 --> 01:11:25.860
being told by the vice president for product sales that our job is to get your phones to ring,

01:11:25.860 --> 01:11:27.860
and the admissions hopefully follow.

01:11:27.860 --> 01:11:32.860
In essence, if you use the product, Dr. Phil is more likely to involve you on the TV show.

01:11:32.860 --> 01:11:34.860
The crew at Dr. Phil swiftly denied this,

01:11:34.860 --> 01:11:38.860
citing the fact that only two centers that use the product had even been mentioned on the TV show,

01:11:38.860 --> 01:11:40.860
and they never made promises.

01:11:40.860 --> 01:11:45.860
Nevertheless, they evaded responding on the matter of the actual comments made by the sales BP,

01:11:45.860 --> 01:11:48.860
and their response doesn't really contradict the report.

01:11:48.860 --> 01:11:51.860
It was never claimed that any promises were made or that a mention was guaranteed,

01:11:51.860 --> 01:11:57.860
and using a reference who had been mentioned thus far isn't proof against what will be mentioned in the future.

01:11:57.860 --> 01:12:00.860
Whether the VP was acting beyond his brief is certainly up for debate,

01:12:00.860 --> 01:12:03.860
but it's hard to doubt that comments were probably made.

01:12:03.860 --> 01:12:08.860
The Dr. Phil show always pursued the image of the program that was willing to put the mental health of its guests

01:12:08.860 --> 01:12:10.860
at the heart of its message.

01:12:10.860 --> 01:12:13.860
However, in many cases, it was clear that there was a conflict of interests,

01:12:13.860 --> 01:12:17.860
and what may be best for the show and those behind it may not be the best for the guests,

01:12:17.860 --> 01:12:23.860
and on closer analysis, in some cases, the places promoted were very questionable indeed.

01:12:32.860 --> 01:12:36.860
I'll discuss this more soon, but I think besides obviously people who are suffering from substance issues,

01:12:36.860 --> 01:12:40.860
another extremely vulnerable group are the youth, in particular those who have been brought on by their parents,

01:12:40.860 --> 01:12:43.860
as it may not have been their own first course of action.

01:12:43.860 --> 01:12:47.860
Now in many cases, when dealing with difficult children, adolescents, and even young adults,

01:12:47.860 --> 01:12:53.860
they're experiencing a lot of hormonal and developmental changes, something that Dr. Phil is quite aware of.

01:13:11.860 --> 01:13:14.860
Your job is to protect your child.

01:13:14.860 --> 01:13:17.860
I'll probably discuss the morality involving young people in a bit,

01:13:17.860 --> 01:13:21.860
but for guests really, as influential as a conversation with Dr. Phil may be,

01:13:21.860 --> 01:13:23.860
the main change is going to come from actually receiving treatment,

01:13:23.860 --> 01:13:28.860
and in that case, the centres are essential to making sure the chances of this happening are maximised,

01:13:28.860 --> 01:13:32.860
and although it won't work for everyone, these individuals are kept safe and well.

01:13:32.860 --> 01:13:35.860
Now in its time, Dr. Phil has recommended a few places,

01:13:35.860 --> 01:13:38.860
and for most adult facilities, there weren't too many controversies,

01:13:38.860 --> 01:13:43.860
but in the last few years there has been a bit of disquiet about two institutes that McGraw has had long-term relationships with,

01:13:43.860 --> 01:13:46.860
both of which specialise in treating children with substance issues.

01:13:46.860 --> 01:13:50.860
The first is a place in Florida, oh dear, called Inspirations.

01:13:50.860 --> 01:13:56.860
They have been featured on the Dr. Phil show, and have also coincidentally used the Dr. Phil Road to Recovery VR headset.

01:13:56.860 --> 01:14:00.860
In their appearances on the show, McGraw was highly complimentary about the work they were doing.

01:14:00.860 --> 01:14:06.860
This is Karen Walsh, she's the owner of Inspirations for Youth and Families.

01:14:06.860 --> 01:14:10.860
It's the nation's leading family addiction treatment and dual diagnosis centre,

01:14:10.860 --> 01:14:15.860
and affiliate of the Cove Centre for Recovery in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

01:14:15.860 --> 01:14:19.860
And fair enough, if they're doing that work, then they deserve to receive their due credit.

01:14:19.860 --> 01:14:21.860
However, some of the evidence suggested otherwise.

01:14:21.860 --> 01:14:26.860
Beyond the owner's own legal issues, much of which happened during the years that Dr. Phil claimed to be working with them,

01:14:26.860 --> 01:14:29.860
there was a more concerning issue regarding the centre itself.

01:14:29.860 --> 01:14:32.860
We're at Inspirations for Youth and Families,

01:14:32.860 --> 01:14:37.860
and what we do is we work with teenagers and their families every day,

01:14:37.860 --> 01:14:45.860
and we help them to figure out how they're going to get past this point in their life where a teenager is struggling with drugs.

01:14:45.860 --> 01:14:50.860
Now it's important that I keep this in perspective, it's a challenge to treat anyone who may struggle with addiction,

01:14:50.860 --> 01:14:54.860
particularly if you're trying to put them back on the slope to a normal functioning life.

01:14:54.860 --> 01:14:57.860
They need guidance, but you can't afford to be too authoritarian,

01:14:57.860 --> 01:15:01.860
therefore it is possible that patients may flee the premises, and needs to be found.

01:15:01.860 --> 01:15:04.860
With this in mind, Inspirations' record on this was a bit less than stellar,

01:15:04.860 --> 01:15:07.860
according to a private investigator who worked within this industry.

01:15:07.860 --> 01:15:14.860
In 2017, it was estimated that approximately 180 police reports for missing teenagers have been made in the space of the previous two years,

01:15:14.860 --> 01:15:19.860
some of whom went missing for days and others ending up on the wrong side of the law completely.

01:15:19.860 --> 01:15:24.860
To quote the PI, obviously there's a gap somewhere, a loophole somewhere in the system where they're just leaving.

01:15:24.860 --> 01:15:27.860
Since these articles, Inspiration doesn't appear to have received much coverage,

01:15:27.860 --> 01:15:30.860
and the video where their work was promoted has the comments disabled.

01:15:30.860 --> 01:15:33.860
How with all this information available, it is fair to ask the question,

01:15:33.860 --> 01:15:38.860
why Dr. Phil decided to characterise the institution as a leading family addiction centre?

01:15:38.860 --> 01:15:41.860
How do you even know who's leading? Is there a leaderboard?

01:15:41.860 --> 01:15:45.860
If there is, I highly doubt Inspirations is near the top, but I digress.

01:15:45.860 --> 01:15:50.860
Inspirations is an example of a place that has some function but falters in its execution,

01:15:50.860 --> 01:15:53.860
which is pretty vital given the sort of people they're meant to be treating,

01:15:53.860 --> 01:15:56.860
and although nobody has come forward with any horror stories,

01:15:56.860 --> 01:16:00.860
it shouldn't have been too difficult to properly vet a place that deals with such a sensitive matter.

01:16:00.860 --> 01:16:05.860
However, as we'll see with our second example, that doesn't seem to be the Dr. Phil show's forte.

01:16:26.860 --> 01:16:52.860
In 2010, Dr. Phil came face to face with two challenging adolescent sisters,

01:16:52.860 --> 01:16:56.860
who he and many others felt were taking advantage of their parents and staged an intervention,

01:16:56.860 --> 01:16:59.860
sending them to a resort that we'll talk about in a little bit.

01:17:13.860 --> 01:17:15.860
Despite the apparently successful treatment of the younger sister,

01:17:15.860 --> 01:17:18.860
the older sister was still acting out, much to the parent's dismay.

01:17:19.860 --> 01:17:21.860
However, against Dr. Phil's advice and the mother's opinion,

01:17:21.860 --> 01:17:25.860
the father did not want to send his daughter to an Aspen Group boarding school,

01:17:25.860 --> 01:17:27.860
as he felt it was not in their best interests,

01:17:27.860 --> 01:17:32.860
which led once again to Dr. Phil inviting them back on for further discussion on the matter.

01:17:48.860 --> 01:18:03.860
This episode billed them as the most frustrating parents,

01:18:03.860 --> 01:18:05.860
and Dr. Phil's attitude seemed to reflect that,

01:18:05.860 --> 01:18:07.860
opening up the episode by quoting enraged viewers,

01:18:07.860 --> 01:18:11.860
and then proceeding to sit down with them and taking them to a task on their failings,

01:18:11.860 --> 01:18:16.860
while spectators froth at their mouths a stark reminder of what happens when you do not listen to the esteemed Dr. Phil.

01:18:18.860 --> 01:18:22.860
I'm really disappointed that your show is only interested in supporting Aspen programs,

01:18:22.860 --> 01:18:26.860
and not other highly qualified programs that could benefit my daughters.

01:18:26.860 --> 01:18:33.860
Obviously, what's beneficial for my daughters is secondary to what is good for the show and for Aspen.

01:18:33.860 --> 01:18:36.860
I understand that first and foremost, you have a business to run.

01:18:38.860 --> 01:18:40.860
Are you serious?

01:18:41.860 --> 01:18:43.860
Are you serious when you write this?

01:18:43.860 --> 01:18:45.860
This is offensive to me.

01:18:45.860 --> 01:18:51.860
I just have to tell you, when I read this, my initial reaction was, I'm done.

01:18:51.860 --> 01:18:57.860
We have an advisory board, it's like 20 people, the top minds in psychology, sociology, medicine.

01:18:57.860 --> 01:19:01.860
When we get a story, it goes out to our advisory board, and we ask them for input.

01:19:01.860 --> 01:19:07.860
One of the top therapeutic residential programs on the globe is the Aspen Group.

01:19:07.860 --> 01:19:12.860
So we reach out to them and say, hey guys, will you help us here?

01:19:12.860 --> 01:19:19.860
We work with dozens of people all over the country, but the collective wisdom is that that's who we're going to contact here.

01:19:19.860 --> 01:19:22.860
Other than an outwardly admitting that he has a business arrangement,

01:19:22.860 --> 01:19:25.860
and accusing the father of requesting financial support for his own preferences,

01:19:25.860 --> 01:19:30.860
despite the fact that he never seemingly wrote that, McGraw doesn't really provide much of a real response to the father

01:19:30.860 --> 01:19:34.860
as to why it's in this girl's best interest to attend a boarding school,

01:19:34.860 --> 01:19:38.860
other than broad philosophical narratives, and expressing how insulted he felt,

01:19:38.860 --> 01:19:43.860
how he consults all the experts, etc. etc. etc. Dr. Phil is the fucking best, whatever.

01:19:43.860 --> 01:19:48.860
The Aspen Group is one of the top residential therapeutic programs on the globe.

01:19:48.860 --> 01:19:51.860
How could you not send your child there?

01:19:51.860 --> 01:19:57.860
Is your teen out of control? The Aspen Education Group can help you get that teen back on track.

01:19:57.860 --> 01:20:04.860
Aspen's nationwide network of programs has been featured on my show for years, and they can help your family too.

01:20:04.860 --> 01:20:11.860
You can call an Aspen consultant today to learn more about their outstanding residential and outdoor programs.

01:20:11.860 --> 01:20:16.860
Well, a large majority of the Aspen Group's projects have been closed down or sold in the last decade.

01:20:16.860 --> 01:20:19.860
In fact, there is not a single boarding school still being operated by them,

01:20:19.860 --> 01:20:24.860
with a fair few scandals that were well known by the time that Dr. Phil went on his verbal crusade against the father,

01:20:24.860 --> 01:20:28.860
including one to a boarding school that resulted in an investigation that concluded that

01:20:28.860 --> 01:20:33.860
the agency had reasonable cause to believe that abuse or neglect occurred at the school, six months before this episode.

01:20:33.860 --> 01:20:36.860
Another place formerly known as Island View has had so many controversies,

01:20:36.860 --> 01:20:39.860
it would be funny if the stories weren't deeply depressing,

01:20:39.860 --> 01:20:43.860
including one in which a girl was fully isolated for 58 days after running away,

01:20:43.860 --> 01:20:49.860
an isolation in which she had to rely on staff attention to even interact with anyone, which did have its occasional failings.

01:20:49.860 --> 01:20:55.860
Dr. Phil was even sooner relating to one of these stories a few years later, but came out on top that time.

01:20:55.860 --> 01:20:59.860
I believe in these folks right here. I believe they have traction.

01:20:59.860 --> 01:21:05.860
If you want to get Alexis there, and Aspen is still willing after all of this,

01:21:05.860 --> 01:21:15.860
and what I consider to be disrespect from you about their motives, then I will make that available to you.

01:21:15.860 --> 01:21:20.860
I don't know, I feel maybe this whole Aspen Group gig isn't everything it's cracked up to be,

01:21:20.860 --> 01:21:24.860
and actually whether by intent or not, the father was in the right.

01:21:25.860 --> 01:21:30.860
But the Dr. Phil's reputation preceded it, Dr. Phil knows what's best for your children,

01:21:30.860 --> 01:21:33.860
he has files on top of files, and if you're to suggest otherwise,

01:21:33.860 --> 01:21:39.860
you're giving in to your offspring's manipulative ploys that have driven a wedge between you and the rest of the family.

01:21:39.860 --> 01:21:42.860
It's a shtick, and it's one that wasn't always completely applicable,

01:21:42.860 --> 01:21:46.860
particularly when the real-world evidence didn't exactly support what was being promoted,

01:21:46.860 --> 01:21:50.860
and when you're dealing with young people that's not something that can be remedied,

01:21:50.860 --> 01:21:56.860
in so many places of debatable standing, it was only a matter of time until one came to the forefront of public discussion.

01:22:14.860 --> 01:22:17.860
Many of you probably don't remember this, or even know about it,

01:22:17.860 --> 01:22:21.860
in the 21st century there was this series that had some international presence known as Brat Camp.

01:22:21.860 --> 01:22:24.860
It was most popular in the UK where it ran for five seasons,

01:22:24.860 --> 01:22:28.860
but did have some counterparts in continental Europe and even a US series.

01:22:28.860 --> 01:22:34.860
As you can maybe guess, the premise was built around adolescence with behavioural and substance issues going to a camp,

01:22:34.860 --> 01:22:40.860
and having those issues addressed, however this wasn't any standard therapy centre, this was more a wilderness camp.

01:22:40.860 --> 01:22:43.860
They teach the kids the ways of the wild west,

01:22:43.860 --> 01:22:51.860
and believe a strict regime of chores, tough rules and harsh punishment can turn bad kids into good kids.

01:22:51.860 --> 01:22:55.860
I have all the compassion in the world for these people, for these kids,

01:22:55.860 --> 01:23:00.860
but I just lack a little sympathy because of the way their behaviour is, and that's what we need to work on.

01:23:00.860 --> 01:23:05.860
In the UK the first season was such a resounding success that they decided to invest in a second series,

01:23:05.860 --> 01:23:11.860
however the producers of this show decided to raise the stakes by casting more challenging teens with intensified drama.

01:23:11.860 --> 01:23:16.860
Upon hearing this, the ranch that was featured in the first series, Red Cliff Ascent, refused to host another series,

01:23:16.860 --> 01:23:21.860
stating that they were a treatment program, not a TV show. Completely fair.

01:23:21.860 --> 01:23:26.860
So the team behind Brat Camp set their sights on another location, this being Escalante, Utah,

01:23:26.860 --> 01:23:29.860
the home of a humble spot known as Turnabout Ranch.

01:23:29.860 --> 01:23:35.860
Turnabout Ranch is one of the many haciendas that have taken on the role of doubling up as a centre for wilderness therapy.

01:23:35.860 --> 01:23:40.860
This sort of therapy is different to the traditional idea of such, it promotes living with the land,

01:23:40.860 --> 01:23:44.860
devoid of the privileges or luxuries that modern life has typically afforded us.

01:23:44.860 --> 01:23:50.860
However, Turnabout Ranch was certainly on the more austere side of these projects, it wasn't Malibu to say the least.

01:23:51.860 --> 01:23:55.860
Everybody get up now. Slumber party's over, get up.

01:23:58.860 --> 01:24:02.860
Quit talking, everybody down here now. Out of bed, let's go.

01:24:06.860 --> 01:24:09.860
Foul language is not appropriate. Foul language is not appropriate.

01:24:10.860 --> 01:24:16.860
No talking. You're going to spend three days out there. It's going to be three of the worst days you've spent a long time in your life.

01:24:16.860 --> 01:24:19.860
You're going to hate every second of it. There's going to be a lot of tears, a lot of emotions.

01:24:21.860 --> 01:24:25.860
So if you want to make it five days, it's your choice. But I'm not going to put up with it.

01:24:25.860 --> 01:24:32.860
In most American camps, the impact stage is used to physically exhaust rebellious kids into being more compliant.

01:24:33.860 --> 01:24:36.860
But at Turnabout, they have a unique strategy.

01:24:37.860 --> 01:24:43.860
For three whole days, the kids are made to stay in a small stone circle in total silence.

01:24:43.860 --> 01:24:47.860
In hindsight, it's hard not to understand why these sorts of shows aren't being aired today.

01:24:47.860 --> 01:24:52.860
They're a pretty cruel form of therapy, and although some people did manage to turn their lives around,

01:24:52.860 --> 01:24:56.860
others didn't, and one former contestant of another series even died in 2009.

01:24:56.860 --> 01:25:01.860
How these sorts of residences continued long after the end of the TV shows that documented their methods.

01:25:01.860 --> 01:25:07.860
In fact, Turnabout in particular went on to be one of the most popular resorts for teens featured on a popular daytime show.

01:25:07.860 --> 01:25:09.860
I wonder what that show could be.

01:25:10.860 --> 01:25:15.860
From the Aspen Education Group, she's one of many groups that we work with.

01:25:15.860 --> 01:25:17.860
She works with Turnabout Ranch.

01:25:17.860 --> 01:25:22.860
Dr Phil has always made a point of not approaching people from the same perspective that many TV shows hosted.

01:25:22.860 --> 01:25:28.860
His conversations with troubled people were always staged more like an intervention rather than an interrogation,

01:25:28.860 --> 01:25:30.860
though sometimes the former did seep into the latter.

01:25:30.860 --> 01:25:34.860
With this in mind, although Dr Phil did want people to take responsibility for their actions,

01:25:34.860 --> 01:25:38.860
it wasn't like they weren't deserving of humane treatment and sympathy.

01:25:38.860 --> 01:25:41.860
However, those who were most troubled, he sent them to Turnabout Ranch.

01:25:41.860 --> 01:25:45.860
That in many ways seemed very much against what he regularly preached on the show.

01:25:45.860 --> 01:25:50.860
Turnabout Ranch wasn't a particularly friendly place, it was the sort of place where if you struggled more,

01:25:50.860 --> 01:25:55.860
you'd receive more severe treatment, as documented in Brat Camp and in Testimonies by Others.

01:25:55.860 --> 01:26:03.860
Yet in 2010, Turnabout Ranch made its debut on the Dr Phil show with an inspirational segment featuring former guests and a softly spoken rancher.

01:26:09.860 --> 01:26:12.860
Being here helped me find happiness.

01:26:12.860 --> 01:26:15.860
When Elena first arrived here, she was very resistant.

01:26:15.860 --> 01:26:19.860
I was furious. Like, I hate everyone.

01:26:19.860 --> 01:26:22.860
She really turned and made some major progress.

01:26:22.860 --> 01:26:28.860
After a couple of days, I was like, wow, it is my fault. I got myself in this situation.

01:26:28.860 --> 01:26:33.860
She really shines as one of our leaders and she takes a lot of pride in what she does.

01:26:33.860 --> 01:26:37.860
Ironically enough, this debut clip featured the girls who I mentioned earlier.

01:26:37.860 --> 01:26:42.860
Most notably Elena, the younger sister who seemed much more receptive to the Ranch's treatment.

01:26:42.860 --> 01:26:47.860
The Ranch was presented as a hands-on getaway where youngsters could build a closer relationship to the wildlife

01:26:47.860 --> 01:26:50.860
and garner a greater appreciation for those around them.

01:26:50.860 --> 01:26:55.860
It seemed pretty positive, however, as Elena's older sister showed, it wasn't a formula that worked for everyone.

01:26:55.860 --> 01:27:00.860
In spite of this though, McGraw and Co proceeded with a pretty close partnership over the following years,

01:27:00.860 --> 01:27:06.860
sending many troubled teens here, leading up to arguably our most high-profile case, Danielle Bregoli.

01:27:07.860 --> 01:27:29.860
Danielle Bregoli was always a bit of an exceptional individual,

01:27:29.860 --> 01:27:34.860
and after her appearances on the Dr. Phil show, McGraw felt there was no other option than to send her to the Turnabout Ranch.

01:27:34.860 --> 01:27:39.860
After all, it was always his answer to those he viewed as the entitled generation.

01:27:39.860 --> 01:27:44.860
Bregoli was a person who continuously undermined Phil and all those who tried to help her,

01:27:44.860 --> 01:27:48.860
and as a last resort, perhaps a more challenging environment would aid her outlook.

01:27:48.860 --> 01:27:52.860
So at the end of 2016, she spent four and a half months in Turnabout Ranch,

01:27:52.860 --> 01:27:56.860
and whatever she experienced there ultimately didn't have any lasting impact,

01:27:56.860 --> 01:28:01.860
as not too long after, she appeared back on the Dr. Phil show ever defined in her nature.

01:28:02.860 --> 01:28:07.860
When you were at Turnabout, you said that you had learned that material things didn't mean as much anymore.

01:28:07.860 --> 01:28:10.860
That was just a show, damn.

01:28:10.860 --> 01:28:12.860
That was just so I could get out of there.

01:28:12.860 --> 01:28:13.860
Let me put it this way.

01:28:13.860 --> 01:28:17.860
Y'all could put me in a program for six years and I'm going to come out the same person I came in.

01:28:17.860 --> 01:28:21.860
How is it being back home?

01:28:21.860 --> 01:28:23.860
I don't know, it's just home.

01:28:23.860 --> 01:28:24.860
What do you want to tell Dr. Phil?

01:28:24.860 --> 01:28:26.860
What I told him last time.

01:28:26.860 --> 01:28:27.860
Thumbs up my d***.

01:28:27.860 --> 01:28:30.860
What do you want to see happen on the show this time?

01:28:30.860 --> 01:28:33.860
This time I won't be throwing water at nobody ever throwing hands at somebody.

01:28:33.860 --> 01:28:37.860
By then, it should have been clear that the Turnabout Ranch didn't really function for everyone,

01:28:37.860 --> 01:28:41.860
but upon her return, it was framed like the failure of such therapy was Bregoli's own fault,

01:28:41.860 --> 01:28:48.860
when in reality, it was clear that the Dr. Phil format wasn't ever effective for someone so aware of their own media presence like Bregoli.

01:28:48.860 --> 01:28:50.860
She knew what the point of Turnabout Ranch would be,

01:28:50.860 --> 01:28:55.860
why would she conform to those expectations when her whole existence is based on rebellion?

01:28:55.860 --> 01:28:58.860
Not many people stop to think that maybe Bregoli wasn't to blame.

01:28:59.860 --> 01:29:02.860
Phil would probably suggest that the fact that she seemed to behave better at Turnout Ranch

01:29:02.860 --> 01:29:05.860
meant that it must be the fault of the home environment,

01:29:05.860 --> 01:29:08.860
but if it genuinely worked in transforming Bregoli's mindset,

01:29:08.860 --> 01:29:10.860
a changing environment wouldn't affect that.

01:29:10.860 --> 01:29:13.860
She's just gotten onto the fact that if she didn't cause as much disruption,

01:29:13.860 --> 01:29:15.860
they'd likely be friendlier towards her.

01:29:15.860 --> 01:29:17.860
However, that's not a philosophy adopted by everyone.

01:29:17.860 --> 01:29:21.860
You see, in the time between 2010 and 2017,

01:29:21.860 --> 01:29:23.860
Turnabout Ranch had been involved in numerous controversies,

01:29:23.860 --> 01:29:25.860
including a lawsuit which alleged torture,

01:29:25.860 --> 01:29:28.860
another patient that claimed to have covered up a sexual assault case,

01:29:28.860 --> 01:29:30.860
and probably the most significant situation,

01:29:30.860 --> 01:29:34.860
an actual homicide that occurred during Danielle Bregoli's time at Turnabout Ranch.

01:29:34.860 --> 01:29:38.860
Clay Brewer, a disturbed teen who had been sent there to receive treatment,

01:29:38.860 --> 01:29:42.860
attacked a staffer with a blunt object who subsequently succumbed to their injuries.

01:29:42.860 --> 01:29:45.860
This was during the controversial circle therapy shown earlier,

01:29:45.860 --> 01:29:49.860
which isolates individuals and is supposed to give them time to think about their lives.

01:29:49.860 --> 01:29:53.860
But in the wrong environment, it's completely valid to see how this would also be detrimental to an individual.

01:29:53.860 --> 01:29:55.860
Now, it should be clear that when something awful happens,

01:29:55.860 --> 01:29:59.860
there has to be a level of responsibility accepted by the individual,

01:29:59.860 --> 01:30:00.860
even if they're a minor,

01:30:00.860 --> 01:30:02.860
but there also has to be some question about how,

01:30:02.860 --> 01:30:03.860
with all this considered,

01:30:03.860 --> 01:30:06.860
Bregoli was meant to come back the happy-go-lucky teen next time.

01:30:06.860 --> 01:30:08.860
If this was just going to be swept under the rug

01:30:08.860 --> 01:30:12.860
and people were going to act like patients should just take it in their stride,

01:30:12.860 --> 01:30:14.860
then they probably had another thing coming.

01:30:14.860 --> 01:30:16.860
And eventually, they did.

01:30:23.860 --> 01:30:32.860
The 21st century definitely prompted us to take a different perspective on talk shows in general,

01:30:32.860 --> 01:30:34.860
and the tabloid genre was no exception,

01:30:34.860 --> 01:30:39.860
especially given that it often generated the most controversy out of any form of that entertainment.

01:30:39.860 --> 01:30:41.860
I've heard some crazy stories over the years,

01:30:41.860 --> 01:30:47.860
but one topic that keeps me scratching my head is when women fake being pregnant.

01:30:47.860 --> 01:30:54.860
Okay, so this is Shane, and he says gay people are disgusting and weak.

01:30:54.860 --> 01:30:56.860
Right here, we've got Greg.

01:30:56.860 --> 01:31:00.860
Greg says that he is terrified of gay people.

01:31:00.860 --> 01:31:01.860
Even in the early days of the genre,

01:31:01.860 --> 01:31:05.860
incidents had occurred that raised questions about the ethics of this content,

01:31:05.860 --> 01:31:09.860
most notably in 1995, when on an episode of the Jenny Jones shows,

01:31:09.860 --> 01:31:13.860
Scott Amadur, a gay man, had expressed love for their male friend Jonathan Schmitz.

01:31:13.860 --> 01:31:16.860
While this confession was seemingly brushed off at first by the male friend,

01:31:16.860 --> 01:31:19.860
three days later, Amadur died at the hands of him.

01:31:19.860 --> 01:31:23.860
Lawsuits and interviews subsequently revealed that the producers of the show had misled Schmitz

01:31:23.860 --> 01:31:25.860
into thinking that his admirer was a woman,

01:31:25.860 --> 01:31:30.860
while being aware of his history of mental disturbance and alcohol slash substance abuse.

01:31:30.860 --> 01:31:32.860
Although not solely responsible for Amadur's death,

01:31:32.860 --> 01:31:35.860
there was little doubt that the actions of the show provoked a tragedy

01:31:35.860 --> 01:31:40.860
while disregarding a culture that was still very hostile towards people of differing sexual preferences.

01:31:40.860 --> 01:31:42.860
It was clear that when dealing with such sensitive topics,

01:31:42.860 --> 01:31:45.860
there was a lack of diplomacy in the pursuit for ratings,

01:31:45.860 --> 01:31:47.860
and this could easily have negative consequences.

01:31:47.860 --> 01:31:49.860
Nonetheless, this also worked to the genre's advantage,

01:31:49.860 --> 01:31:52.860
as it purported to show the uglier side of humanity.

01:31:52.860 --> 01:31:55.860
Therefore, certain incidents were going to be inevitable.

01:31:55.860 --> 01:31:58.860
Whether it was even fair to show these in the first place is a question that I'll get to later,

01:31:58.860 --> 01:32:00.860
but in cases such as Jeremy Kyle,

01:32:00.860 --> 01:32:04.860
it was clear that mistreatment of people was so commonplace because it was expected,

01:32:04.860 --> 01:32:06.860
and in both cases of Jones and Kyle,

01:32:06.860 --> 01:32:09.860
these shows were only ever fully reprimanded when someone actually died.

01:32:09.860 --> 01:32:13.860
Hell, the Jenny Jones show continued for an additional eight years

01:32:13.860 --> 01:32:15.860
after the death of the aforementioned guest.

01:32:15.860 --> 01:32:17.860
Doctor Phil was different, though.

01:32:17.860 --> 01:32:22.860
You've got to miss siblings, you've got to miss those that...

01:32:22.860 --> 01:32:24.860
I think about it every day.

01:32:24.860 --> 01:32:29.860
Like, I just, I miss my twin sister, I miss my brother.

01:32:29.860 --> 01:32:31.860
I miss all of them, really.

01:32:31.860 --> 01:32:33.860
You don't have to miss Abba because she's here.

01:32:33.860 --> 01:32:34.860
Abba, come on out.

01:32:34.860 --> 01:32:46.860
Although he wasn't afraid to tackle the tough subjects,

01:32:46.860 --> 01:32:49.860
he still did it with the narrative of helping and supporting these people,

01:32:49.860 --> 01:32:51.860
who he knew, as a professional,

01:32:51.860 --> 01:32:53.860
were still encountering some form of struggle,

01:32:53.860 --> 01:32:55.860
regardless of what they may have done.

01:32:55.860 --> 01:32:57.860
Therefore, in spite of the space that he operated in,

01:32:57.860 --> 01:33:00.860
Doctor Phil still had a reputation to uphold,

01:33:00.860 --> 01:33:02.860
and as someone who had been under fire for the past few years,

01:33:02.860 --> 01:33:06.860
and embroiled in lawsuits, this was certainly going to be a challenge.

01:33:06.860 --> 01:33:10.860
The era that we live in is also quite different to that of 1995.

01:33:10.860 --> 01:33:13.860
The online world definitely enabled an interconnectivity

01:33:13.860 --> 01:33:16.860
that allowed people to spread their messages more effectively,

01:33:16.860 --> 01:33:18.860
and by establishing himself as an online presence,

01:33:18.860 --> 01:33:21.860
thanks to the help of platforms like YouTube and those who existed there,

01:33:21.860 --> 01:33:24.860
he also opened himself up to criticism from the platform,

01:33:24.860 --> 01:33:26.860
and by 2021, it had long been brewing.

01:33:26.860 --> 01:33:29.860
The thing about YouTube is that it's a two-way street.

01:33:29.860 --> 01:33:33.860
If you have a public spat or altercation where you platform that person,

01:33:33.860 --> 01:33:37.860
there are very few plugs that can be pulled on another person's ability to broadcast publicly,

01:33:37.860 --> 01:33:41.860
and you can very easily provide them a platform through your own actions.

01:33:41.860 --> 01:33:43.860
This was exactly the case with Danielle Bregoli,

01:33:43.860 --> 01:33:46.860
who by 2021 went by the name of Bad Baby,

01:33:46.860 --> 01:33:48.860
and was well known outside of YouTube.

01:33:48.860 --> 01:33:51.860
However, in April, she returned to the platform that immortalized her,

01:33:51.860 --> 01:33:55.860
with the intent on presenting our esteemed TV host with an ultimatum.

01:33:56.860 --> 01:34:01.860
So, Dr. Phil, I'm going to give you from now till April 5th to issue an apology,

01:34:01.860 --> 01:34:06.860
not only to me, but to Hannah and any other child that you sent to Turnabout

01:34:06.860 --> 01:34:10.860
or any other program like this, and if you don't, I'm going to handle things my way.

01:34:10.860 --> 01:34:13.860
Somewhere in the middle of August, I went on the Dr. Phil show,

01:34:13.860 --> 01:34:16.860
and my mom and my grandma knew they were sending me here.

01:34:16.860 --> 01:34:17.860
I didn't know I was going.

01:34:17.860 --> 01:34:19.860
I went school shopping right before because the school was supposed to start

01:34:19.860 --> 01:34:22.860
when I got home from L.A. from doing the show.

01:34:22.860 --> 01:34:26.860
So, part of the whole Dr. Phil show is they send these kids to either Turnabout

01:34:26.860 --> 01:34:28.860
or these other programs that are also in Utah,

01:34:28.860 --> 01:34:31.860
but they're all wilderness programs, and they're all fucked up.

01:34:31.860 --> 01:34:34.860
This video not only called out the modus operandi of the show,

01:34:34.860 --> 01:34:36.860
but also the treatment at Turnabout Branch,

01:34:36.860 --> 01:34:39.860
and the supposed therapy that they received there.

01:34:39.860 --> 01:34:41.860
So, for the first three days, there is no showering.

01:34:41.860 --> 01:34:44.860
They put you in a circle, which is a TP.

01:34:44.860 --> 01:34:47.860
It's a little TP, but it's open, and you have to sit there for three days.

01:34:47.860 --> 01:34:49.860
They wouldn't let me lay down for nothing.

01:34:49.860 --> 01:34:52.860
I was falling asleep, and they were like, uh-uh, get up, get up.

01:34:52.860 --> 01:34:55.860
So, I'm just sitting here like, this is going to be really bad.

01:34:55.860 --> 01:34:59.860
When I see these people have no sympathy, I was like, oh, I'm really doomed.

01:34:59.860 --> 01:35:04.860
They take away necessity privileges, like sleeping on a bed, eating good food,

01:35:04.860 --> 01:35:06.860
not being cold, witnessing it.

01:35:06.860 --> 01:35:11.860
If you reported another kid getting bullied by their peers or something,

01:35:11.860 --> 01:35:15.860
they would just say, well, maybe that's what they need, or something like that.

01:35:15.860 --> 01:35:19.860
Even though there was written rules, if a staff was angry at the moment,

01:35:19.860 --> 01:35:21.860
or if you just did something that they felt was bad,

01:35:21.860 --> 01:35:23.860
you would get your own punishment.

01:35:23.860 --> 01:35:24.860
They would make up their own punishment for you.

01:35:24.860 --> 01:35:27.860
It's really frustrating, because even if you don't know the rules,

01:35:27.860 --> 01:35:29.860
if you fuck up, you're still in trouble.

01:35:29.860 --> 01:35:31.860
There's not no, I didn't know.

01:35:31.860 --> 01:35:33.860
You're still in deep shit.

01:35:33.860 --> 01:35:37.860
They had no problem holding kids down, which is against the law.

01:35:37.860 --> 01:35:40.860
You're not supposed to touch the kids, but they had no problem doing that.

01:35:40.860 --> 01:35:43.860
It's just our word against the staff's word when you're there,

01:35:43.860 --> 01:35:46.860
because there's no witnesses, there's no cameras, you don't have a phone.

01:35:46.860 --> 01:35:47.860
There's none of that.

01:35:47.860 --> 01:35:50.860
That's why I was always so scared to speak out, because no one's going to believe me.

01:35:50.860 --> 01:35:53.860
Now this is of course a personal testimony.

01:35:53.860 --> 01:35:56.860
However, looking at the episodes of Brat Camp that I had archived,

01:35:56.860 --> 01:35:57.860
this all seemed very feasible.

01:35:57.860 --> 01:36:00.860
For some, of course, this would seem like appropriate disciplinary measures

01:36:00.860 --> 01:36:02.860
against an ill-mannered teen.

01:36:02.860 --> 01:36:05.860
However, this was also never really explained on Dr. Phil,

01:36:05.860 --> 01:36:08.860
and as a matter of fact, whenever discussing Turnabout Ranch,

01:36:08.860 --> 01:36:12.860
footage would always be shown of an activity more wholesome, such as horse riding.

01:36:13.860 --> 01:36:15.860
I doubt that was unintentional.

01:36:15.860 --> 01:36:17.860
One morning I was cleaning up for breakfast,

01:36:17.860 --> 01:36:19.860
and one of the staff members was standing right next to me,

01:36:19.860 --> 01:36:21.860
and she had her walkie on her, so I heard everything.

01:36:21.860 --> 01:36:23.860
One of the kids, he had tried to steal a car or something,

01:36:23.860 --> 01:36:26.860
everyone was screaming on the walkies like it was really crazy,

01:36:26.860 --> 01:36:28.860
and he ended up killing one of the staff members.

01:36:28.860 --> 01:36:30.860
They made all the kids that were at Roundy come down,

01:36:30.860 --> 01:36:32.860
and then they told us not to tell us anything.

01:36:32.860 --> 01:36:36.860
A day later, every kid that's at Turnabout, they have us all in a circle,

01:36:36.860 --> 01:36:39.860
and they're like, listen, it was an incident, I know some of y'all heard it over the walkies,

01:36:39.860 --> 01:36:40.860
Jimmy died.

01:36:41.860 --> 01:36:43.860
And so we're all freaking out, because Jimmy was, like I said,

01:36:43.860 --> 01:36:46.860
he was one of them that was there the first day I got there, he was really sweet.

01:36:46.860 --> 01:36:50.860
Not only did Jimmy die, but one of the other staff members that was there at the time,

01:36:50.860 --> 01:36:53.860
Alicia, who was the daughter of the nurse,

01:36:53.860 --> 01:36:58.860
Alicia, she was injured, and two years later she died,

01:36:58.860 --> 01:37:02.860
and she was also left disabled after being attacked by Clay.

01:37:02.860 --> 01:37:05.860
Bregoli's recounting of the Turnabout Ranch goes over many unnerving details,

01:37:05.860 --> 01:37:07.860
including that relating to the death of the staff,

01:37:08.860 --> 01:37:11.860
and how that would understandably affect a young person residing there,

01:37:11.860 --> 01:37:13.860
however there are more details she wanted to reveal.

01:37:14.860 --> 01:37:19.860
A young lady, her name is Hannah, she recently spoke out,

01:37:19.860 --> 01:37:22.860
because while she was there, she was sexually assaulted,

01:37:22.860 --> 01:37:26.860
and then when she reported that she was assaulted, she was punished by staff.

01:37:26.860 --> 01:37:31.860
Now, when I seen the punishment she was given, I knew like,

01:37:31.860 --> 01:37:34.860
okay, I really have to say something, I really have to have her back on this,

01:37:34.860 --> 01:37:36.860
because I truly believe that they did that.

01:37:36.860 --> 01:37:40.860
This claim covered the alleged violation of someone who was staying at the ranch at the same time,

01:37:40.860 --> 01:37:43.860
and how she was treated by personnel when she complained about it.

01:37:43.860 --> 01:37:46.860
It was clearly a matter that Bregoli took very seriously,

01:37:46.860 --> 01:37:49.860
and with this information it was easy to understand why she expected, at the least,

01:37:49.860 --> 01:37:51.860
an apology from the man himself.

01:37:51.860 --> 01:37:54.860
Would they receive it? Well, not really.

01:37:54.860 --> 01:37:57.860
Around a week after the publication of the video,

01:37:57.860 --> 01:38:00.860
Dr. Phil made an appearance on the Ashley Banfield show NewsNation

01:38:00.860 --> 01:38:02.860
to discuss this matter further.

01:38:02.860 --> 01:38:04.860
This was a pretty significant moment in the show's history,

01:38:04.860 --> 01:38:07.860
as Dr. Phil had very rarely taken to interviews to address situations

01:38:07.860 --> 01:38:10.860
which may question his character, outside the show at least.

01:38:10.860 --> 01:38:13.860
However, after a few minutes you begin to see why.

01:38:13.860 --> 01:38:18.860
Well, you know, she went to turnabout four or five years ago,

01:38:18.860 --> 01:38:21.860
and she had a bad experience.

01:38:21.860 --> 01:38:24.860
Obviously, I would hate that, we'd be sorry about that,

01:38:24.860 --> 01:38:31.860
but we don't have anything to do with what happens with guests once they leave the stage.

01:38:31.860 --> 01:38:37.860
I mean, that's between the guardian and the parent, and whatever facility they go to.

01:38:37.860 --> 01:38:40.860
So he does say that he would be sorry if she'd had a bad experience.

01:38:40.860 --> 01:38:44.860
I suppose that is a half-apology, but I don't think there's that much question

01:38:44.860 --> 01:38:46.860
that she had a bad experience by the sound of it,

01:38:46.860 --> 01:38:49.860
regardless of whether what she's saying is 100% honest.

01:38:49.860 --> 01:38:53.860
I don't think we need any ifs at this point, if that's the threshold for an apology.

01:38:53.860 --> 01:38:58.860
What else is there but some tough love, you know, at a ranch or where else?

01:38:58.860 --> 01:39:01.860
You can't coddle kids like that.

01:39:01.860 --> 01:39:05.860
He also seems to distance himself from his own personal involvement in Turnabout Ranch.

01:39:05.860 --> 01:39:09.860
And okay, although I would say it's difficult to hold Dr. Phil personally responsible

01:39:09.860 --> 01:39:13.860
for the actions of another individual, this still isn't an honest reply.

01:39:13.860 --> 01:39:17.860
To be frank, the idea that they have absolutely no involvement is just preposterous.

01:39:17.860 --> 01:39:21.860
The countless promotional videos, the unrivalled, unquestioning praise,

01:39:21.860 --> 01:39:24.860
they all say far much more than McGraw can say in a single interview.

01:39:24.860 --> 01:39:28.860
Dr. Phil was extremely enthusiastic about the organisations he worked with,

01:39:28.860 --> 01:39:31.860
even to the point of roasting parents who didn't agree.

01:39:31.860 --> 01:39:33.860
He could have acted shocked when confronted with this information,

01:39:33.860 --> 01:39:35.860
and it would have been more convincing than him saying

01:39:35.860 --> 01:39:39.860
they don't have anything to do with these places once they're out of Dr. Phil's care.

01:39:39.860 --> 01:39:45.860
So we're not involved in that, we don't have any feedback from them,

01:39:45.860 --> 01:39:52.860
so whatever happens once they're there, that's between them and the facility.

01:39:52.860 --> 01:39:56.860
I assume she had a problem, she filed a complaint with the proper authorities

01:39:56.860 --> 01:40:00.860
or something five years ago, so I really don't know much about it.

01:40:00.860 --> 01:40:07.860
And we asked them for input on one of the top therapeutic residential programs on the globe.

01:40:07.860 --> 01:40:09.860
Yeah, right.

01:40:09.860 --> 01:40:13.860
Tonight on an all-new episode, the dangers of Dr. Phil.

01:40:13.860 --> 01:40:28.860
A few months after the video and the subsequent Dr. Phil interview,

01:40:28.860 --> 01:40:31.860
it was announced that the victim of the violation that Bregoli had spoken about,

01:40:31.860 --> 01:40:35.860
Hannah Archuleta, was initiating a lawsuit against Dr. Phil and their collaborating studios

01:40:35.860 --> 01:40:38.860
for the participation in sending children to Turnabout Ranch,

01:40:38.860 --> 01:40:43.860
or supposedly being aware of the many controversies that the centre had been involved in since the early 2010s.

01:40:43.860 --> 01:40:48.860
We'll address the result of that in a bit, but it definitely posed the question of how ignorant Dr. Phil could be

01:40:48.860 --> 01:40:51.860
to the many problems that seemed evident to any onlooker,

01:40:51.860 --> 01:40:56.860
and these qualms would only be heightened as the industry looked more inward to address problems of workplace culture.

01:40:56.860 --> 01:41:01.860
2020 was an interesting year for many reasons, however, as many viewers of this channel may recall,

01:41:01.860 --> 01:41:05.860
it was the year where the conduct of certain talk show hosts was brought into question,

01:41:05.860 --> 01:41:10.860
and their otherwise beloved reputation challenged. Probably the most notable example of this was Ellen,

01:41:10.860 --> 01:41:13.860
who many claimed was an all-round unpleasant person to deal with,

01:41:13.860 --> 01:41:19.860
while the working conditions behind the scenes of her supposedly lovable show were comparable to that of an authoritarian regime.

01:41:19.860 --> 01:41:24.860
Needless to say, whether you believed in every story's verity or not, the effect it had on the show was evident,

01:41:24.860 --> 01:41:27.860
with ratings plummeting, and barely a couple of years later,

01:41:27.860 --> 01:41:32.860
The Ellen DeGeneres Show was brought to an end after 19 seasons of mostly enjoyed success.

01:41:32.860 --> 01:41:35.860
The allegations certainly shook up the industry to say the least,

01:41:35.860 --> 01:41:40.860
and lifted the veil on the often hushed workplace culture that had seldom received scrutiny.

01:41:40.860 --> 01:41:46.860
For many, it was a bad experience, but up until then, many former employees had likely viewed it through the lens of any other job.

01:41:46.860 --> 01:41:51.860
The difference is, when you're dealing with celebrities who preach the principles that aren't necessarily reflected in their private persona,

01:41:51.860 --> 01:41:55.860
there's a disingenuousness to their trade that makes you feel compelled to call them out.

01:41:55.860 --> 01:41:58.860
However, while this was new in many corners of the industry,

01:41:58.860 --> 01:42:02.860
arguably the tabloid talk shows should have been the most conscious of this.

01:42:02.860 --> 01:42:06.860
They've been long subject to criticism regarding maltreatment of those around them,

01:42:06.860 --> 01:42:10.860
especially given the often sensitive and revealing topics surrounding their guests.

01:42:10.860 --> 01:42:15.860
As a matter of fact, in 2016, Dr. Phil and his producers had already been sued by a former employee

01:42:15.860 --> 01:42:17.860
who had claimed they were falsely imprisoned during a meeting,

01:42:17.860 --> 01:42:21.860
when McGraw had locked the doors and threatened employees after information had leaked.

01:42:21.860 --> 01:42:24.860
The producers of Dr. Phil subsequently countersued, claiming that this employee,

01:42:24.860 --> 01:42:29.860
who worked as a producer and director, had lifted footage from the production that infringed on the copyright,

01:42:29.860 --> 01:42:32.860
employment, and confidentiality rights of the show.

01:42:32.860 --> 01:42:36.860
In the end, the judge sided with the producers, and the potential for further publicity seemed to burn out.

01:42:36.860 --> 01:42:41.860
At first, it seemed that Dr. Phil had avoided the blast radius of the talk show apocalypse,

01:42:41.860 --> 01:42:46.860
but barely a few months before Ellen's final episode on February 11th, 2022,

01:42:46.860 --> 01:42:51.860
two present and ten former employees came forward to attest to a work environment that was anything but therapeutic.

01:42:52.860 --> 01:42:56.860
In many ways, the allegations against the Dr. Phil show followed a similar narrative to those that had

01:42:56.860 --> 01:42:58.860
sunk Ellen a couple of years before.

01:42:58.860 --> 01:43:03.860
Although employees on the article did not directly witness McGraw berating or abusing employees,

01:43:03.860 --> 01:43:07.860
many of the producers acted tyrannically towards those working on the show,

01:43:07.860 --> 01:43:10.860
engaging in behaviour that caused serious upset and discomfort.

01:43:10.860 --> 01:43:13.860
With how systemic and widespread the problem was in the workplace,

01:43:13.860 --> 01:43:17.860
many found it difficult to believe that an accomplished, observant psychologist and TV host

01:43:17.860 --> 01:43:20.860
would merely be ignorant to these incidents, with one being quoted as saying,

01:43:20.860 --> 01:43:22.860
how can he not know?

01:43:22.860 --> 01:43:25.860
Most of this centered in on a place called the control room,

01:43:25.860 --> 01:43:28.860
which employees described as a war zone, with yelling, insults,

01:43:28.860 --> 01:43:32.860
and all-round disrespect for employees who worked in those high pressure conditions.

01:43:32.860 --> 01:43:35.860
The one public testimonial in this article comes from Tiffany Clark,

01:43:35.860 --> 01:43:37.860
who briefly did some work on behalf of Paramount.

01:43:37.860 --> 01:43:41.860
She said that during her short tenure, she was mercilessly berated by a supervisor

01:43:41.860 --> 01:43:45.860
who threatened jobs and openly bragged about making other employees quit.

01:43:45.860 --> 01:43:48.860
This information tells us a story endemic to many LA productions,

01:43:48.860 --> 01:43:52.860
and if you remove the names, you probably wouldn't be able to tell it from a show like Ellen.

01:43:52.860 --> 01:43:57.860
However, there was an aspect that set these claims apart from your usual studio hellhole.

01:43:57.860 --> 01:44:01.860
As we noted, there are multiple testimonies that assert that the show subtly nudged guests

01:44:01.860 --> 01:44:05.860
towards problematic behaviour that may be connected with the struggles they were encountering,

01:44:05.860 --> 01:44:08.860
all of whom are from the guests themselves and their relatives.

01:44:08.860 --> 01:44:10.860
However, in this case, the employees appear to back up these claims,

01:44:10.860 --> 01:44:14.860
with multiple stories regarding the instruction they received when handling the show's participants.

01:44:14.860 --> 01:44:17.860
These included being encouraged to perpetuate racial stereotypes,

01:44:17.860 --> 01:44:20.860
not being properly equipped to deal with mentally vulnerable guests,

01:44:20.860 --> 01:44:23.860
and even one case where an employee claims they were directed to make sure a guest

01:44:23.860 --> 01:44:25.860
did not take their medication before going on stage.

01:44:25.860 --> 01:44:29.860
Former members of staff also say they were advised to manipulate and befriend guests

01:44:29.860 --> 01:44:33.860
in an attempt to obtain bookings for the show, while profiling them on a variety of fronts.

01:44:33.860 --> 01:44:37.860
This is partially substantiated by an excerpt from an email that commends workers

01:44:37.860 --> 01:44:39.860
for convincing guests that they're trusted confidants,

01:44:40.860 --> 01:44:44.860
but reminding them to keep their distance, as said guests will likely throw them under the bus,

01:44:44.860 --> 01:44:48.860
not the sort of sympathetic outlook on guests that you'd expect from Dr. Phil.

01:44:48.860 --> 01:44:52.860
By this time, such claims of workplace misconduct were becoming more and more pervasive,

01:44:52.860 --> 01:44:54.860
and for such an environment, maybe that wasn't surprising,

01:44:54.860 --> 01:44:57.860
it seems to be a deeply ingrained cultural issue.

01:44:57.860 --> 01:45:00.860
However, the one aspect that should always be prioritised in this sort of show

01:45:00.860 --> 01:45:04.860
is the safety of guests who genuinely need help above anything else,

01:45:04.860 --> 01:45:07.860
something that Dr. Phil has always publicly preached.

01:45:07.860 --> 01:45:10.860
This didn't appear to be a cultural misstep, this seemed to be intentional,

01:45:10.860 --> 01:45:13.860
and for that, there were much more serious ramifications.

01:45:13.860 --> 01:45:16.860
As always, it's important to present both sides,

01:45:16.860 --> 01:45:19.860
and as many other stories reported, the team behind Dr. Phil did respond,

01:45:19.860 --> 01:45:23.860
firstly denying any of the allegations regarding treatment of staff and guests,

01:45:23.860 --> 01:45:28.860
while also referring their own members of staff to the publication in support of their perspective.

01:45:28.860 --> 01:45:31.860
Their angle was that yes, filming of a show like Dr. Phil could be intense,

01:45:31.860 --> 01:45:34.860
especially considering the unpredictability of those involved.

01:45:34.860 --> 01:45:37.860
However, nobody has been abused, nobody has been treated unfairly,

01:45:37.860 --> 01:45:43.860
and nobody was subjected to any forms of profiling or stereotyping under the watch of a show's executive.

01:45:43.860 --> 01:45:48.860
We can't support one experience unquestionably without taking into account the other experiences,

01:45:48.860 --> 01:45:53.860
and obviously the producers offered individuals who contradicted the accusatory testimonies written in the article.

01:45:53.860 --> 01:45:57.860
However, the report definitely outlined a continuing narrative on the Dr. Phil show,

01:45:57.860 --> 01:45:59.860
one that it was struggling to shake off.

01:45:59.860 --> 01:46:01.860
This isn't the first time that such claims have been made,

01:46:02.860 --> 01:46:05.860
and although an intensive workshop may create disgruntled employees,

01:46:05.860 --> 01:46:10.860
it's hardly a complete explanation for the often corroborating stories from supposedly separate sources.

01:46:10.860 --> 01:46:12.860
All I'd say is that in this case,

01:46:12.860 --> 01:46:16.860
it's hard to blame people for believing what was being said with the information available,

01:46:16.860 --> 01:46:19.860
whereas in the past, the Dr. Phil show had cast doubt on the guests and their families

01:46:19.860 --> 01:46:24.860
by pointing to the possibility of ulterior motives and the fact that certain memories may be corrupted,

01:46:24.860 --> 01:46:26.860
that didn't really apply here.

01:46:26.860 --> 01:46:29.860
To be frank, there wasn't a copious amount of new evidence being presented,

01:46:29.860 --> 01:46:33.860
but these claims were substantiated by what was already publicly available to viewers,

01:46:33.860 --> 01:46:38.860
and only added an additional layer of credibility to the criticisms being levelled against the Dr. Phil crew.

01:46:38.860 --> 01:46:41.860
But could it tell us anything about the man himself?

01:47:00.860 --> 01:47:06.860
Other than the lawsuit in 2016,

01:47:06.860 --> 01:47:11.860
we didn't really have much evidence that supported this idea that Dr. Phil was an outwardly unpleasant person

01:47:11.860 --> 01:47:15.860
to those around him, and to be fair, you can't control everything your employees say or do.

01:47:15.860 --> 01:47:20.860
However, many would argue that he had presented himself as a hands-on person who cared about making a difference

01:47:20.860 --> 01:47:23.860
in these people's lives, and this seemed to contradict that.

01:47:23.860 --> 01:47:26.860
Now, with everything considered, the show still hasn't picked up too much plaque,

01:47:26.860 --> 01:47:29.860
I think mainly because controversy comes with the territory,

01:47:29.860 --> 01:47:32.860
and such TV shows are never going to be completely unproblematic.

01:47:32.860 --> 01:47:37.860
Whereas someone like Ellen was meant to represent an environment where people could just be unbridled in their joy,

01:47:37.860 --> 01:47:40.860
Dr. Phil thrives on the energy of the guests as well,

01:47:40.860 --> 01:47:45.860
many of whom bring their own, sometimes less-than-positive spirit to the stage.

01:47:45.860 --> 01:47:48.860
That chaos seemed more in-built with that structure,

01:47:48.860 --> 01:47:51.860
which unfortunately makes such workplace misconduct stand out less.

01:47:51.860 --> 01:47:54.860
It's not a surprise that the Dr. Phil machine has mostly persisted,

01:47:54.860 --> 01:47:57.860
rather unscathed from the troubles of the past few years.

01:47:57.860 --> 01:48:00.860
However, this hasn't stopped people from asking questions,

01:48:00.860 --> 01:48:03.860
and I think as skepticism of this form of therapy content in general rises,

01:48:03.860 --> 01:48:08.860
then people are likely to revisit these claims, and time won't necessarily nullify them.

01:48:08.860 --> 01:48:11.860
When put together in one place, they do tell a damning story,

01:48:11.860 --> 01:48:16.860
and one that doesn't present the most flattering image of one of TV's most famous therapists.

01:48:16.860 --> 01:48:19.860
Creating compelling television is always a struggle,

01:48:19.860 --> 01:48:22.860
because a lot of people want to see what they often can't see in their own lives.

01:48:22.860 --> 01:48:26.860
Therapy is one of those things that is personal, it's between two private individuals,

01:48:26.860 --> 01:48:31.860
and obviously, for many in the psychological field, that confidentiality is part of the process,

01:48:31.860 --> 01:48:36.860
a place where you can talk about your deepest, darkest thoughts with the hope of eventually expelling them.

01:48:36.860 --> 01:48:41.860
It's hard to do something publicly when many would argue that privacy is part of its necessity.

01:48:41.860 --> 01:48:44.860
After all, as people like Daniel Bregoli show,

01:48:44.860 --> 01:48:48.860
when cameras and audience members are viewing you, you're conditioned to behave differently.

01:48:48.860 --> 01:48:52.860
However, I also think there is value in people being open about their struggles,

01:48:52.860 --> 01:48:55.860
and there being a medium to connect with that over.

01:48:55.860 --> 01:48:59.860
There may not be a right way to do this, but there is a best way to do this.

01:48:59.860 --> 01:49:03.860
By 2022, I think that critics had lost faith that this was the best way,

01:49:03.860 --> 01:49:05.860
or that it was even a worthwhile route.

01:49:05.860 --> 01:49:08.860
Whether it was Dr. Phil's individual will or not,

01:49:08.860 --> 01:49:12.860
there were clearly conflicts of interest between driving the vehicle that creates entertaining TV,

01:49:12.860 --> 01:49:15.860
and actually protecting the world being a vulnerable guest.

01:49:15.860 --> 01:49:19.860
Even discounting the allegations, many of the clips spoke for themselves.

01:49:19.860 --> 01:49:20.860
Hi, Dr. Phil.

01:49:20.860 --> 01:49:24.860
Hi, I'm Todd. Nice to meet you.

01:49:24.860 --> 01:49:27.860
How are you feeling, man? Can you walk?

01:49:27.860 --> 01:49:32.860
Apparently, I have to have help.

01:49:32.860 --> 01:49:34.860
Sorry, I'm very...

01:49:34.860 --> 01:49:37.860
Although you could certainly attribute certain blame to individuals,

01:49:37.860 --> 01:49:41.860
I think there was also a great question looming over the show that McGraw operated,

01:49:41.860 --> 01:49:43.860
particularly regarding its methodology.

01:49:43.860 --> 01:49:48.860
The prioritization of tell-all television is something that's always been valued in the industry.

01:49:48.860 --> 01:49:51.860
However, I think there were new elements that Dr. Phil introduced

01:49:51.860 --> 01:49:56.860
which made that pursuit more dangerous for people who may find themselves in a vulnerable place.

01:49:56.860 --> 01:50:01.860
In a way, what the Dr. Phil show promoted as its greatest facets were also its greatest problems.

01:50:01.860 --> 01:50:05.860
We return to this point of help, the one that McGraw helped set the program apart with

01:50:05.860 --> 01:50:08.860
by collaborating with all these centers and clinics.

01:50:08.860 --> 01:50:13.860
To me, it seems that the Dr. Phil showrunners either didn't realize the level of height and responsibility

01:50:13.860 --> 01:50:16.860
that rested on their shoulders, or were aware and simply did not care.

01:50:16.860 --> 01:50:22.860
One allegation in particular comes to mind, that made by the mother who had to visit Skid Row with her daughter,

01:50:22.860 --> 01:50:25.860
that she'd been told that if she wanted her daughter to receive treatment that they were offering,

01:50:25.860 --> 01:50:29.860
she would have to cooperate with the narrative being spun on stage.

01:50:29.860 --> 01:50:33.860
I feel it's a believable scenario, but even if the details weren't exactly so,

01:50:33.860 --> 01:50:37.860
I do think it underlines the extremely sensitive power dynamic that is present during the show.

01:50:37.860 --> 01:50:42.860
On one hand, the notion of receiving help is a good idea that hasn't been nearly present in enough of these shows.

01:50:42.860 --> 01:50:46.860
However, as the only party that can provide that help in these scenarios,

01:50:46.860 --> 01:50:50.860
there's also an invisible dependence that is experienced by many of the guests.

01:50:50.860 --> 01:50:54.860
They're relying on the show to offer that help, but that help is chosen by the show

01:50:54.860 --> 01:50:57.860
and can be withdrawn at any time, as Dr. Phil explained himself.

01:50:57.860 --> 01:51:02.860
One thing I knew for sure is that these girls were not ready to be home because home wasn't ready for these girls.

01:51:02.860 --> 01:51:08.860
I told you that, I was clear about it, and then you say, well, I've actually talked to some other experts,

01:51:08.860 --> 01:51:14.860
then you need to do what they want you to do. Best of luck to you, but I'm not going to support that.

01:51:14.860 --> 01:51:18.860
Who wouldn't want to cooperate with Dr. Phil's narratives in these cases,

01:51:18.860 --> 01:51:21.860
particularly when a person in your relationship with them are at stake,

01:51:21.860 --> 01:51:24.860
and these people are their friends, their family.

01:51:24.860 --> 01:51:28.860
Fleeting public dignity is a small price to pay to help your struggling relative to survive.

01:51:28.860 --> 01:51:32.860
Dr. Phil said that he wasn't involved in the actual treatment after his show,

01:51:32.860 --> 01:51:35.860
and that statement's falsehood is borderline self-explanatory.

01:51:35.860 --> 01:51:38.860
If that statement was true, then this dynamic would never have existed,

01:51:38.860 --> 01:51:42.860
as the help offered would be independent of whatever Dr. Phil says on his show.

01:51:42.860 --> 01:51:44.860
Instead, they're intertwined.

01:51:44.860 --> 01:51:49.860
The behavior exhibited on Dr. Phil's show directly influences the treatment these individuals receive.

01:51:49.860 --> 01:51:52.860
Their actions on air dictates Dr. Phil's recommendations,

01:51:52.860 --> 01:51:57.860
despite the many extraneous variables that can influence their deportment during these episodes.

01:51:57.860 --> 01:52:01.860
Many of these people's progress continues to be covered and critiqued in front of the cameras,

01:52:01.860 --> 01:52:05.860
even in these clinics and therapy centers. It's part of the show.

01:52:05.860 --> 01:52:07.860
And if that's the choice of the show, then so be it,

01:52:07.860 --> 01:52:11.860
but you have to acknowledge that it's a flaw system that can yield some complications,

01:52:11.860 --> 01:52:16.860
and that it is an effect of the show you operate, regardless of whether you wish to admit it.

01:52:16.860 --> 01:52:21.860
But if we're going to do this, we're going to do this my way.

01:52:21.860 --> 01:52:25.860
So even if that help was flawed, many didn't want to cry or criticize it

01:52:25.860 --> 01:52:28.860
because it could influence how they received that help.

01:52:28.860 --> 01:52:32.860
Dr. Phil's seal of approval propelled a lot of these places into the spotlight,

01:52:32.860 --> 01:52:34.860
and even if someone had a negative experience with such a place,

01:52:34.860 --> 01:52:38.860
they may hesitate to speak up if they still have loved ones involved in the treatment.

01:52:38.860 --> 01:52:44.860
And who would dare question the moral authority of someone as revered as Dr. Phil McGraw?

01:52:44.860 --> 01:52:48.860
With all this in mind, it just makes his first response even worse.

01:52:48.860 --> 01:52:55.860
We don't have anything to do with what happens with guests once they leave the stage.

01:52:55.860 --> 01:53:01.860
If there is any shred of truth in what he said, it means that he had no investment or interest

01:53:01.860 --> 01:53:06.860
in the quality of care provided by a lot of these places that he rode so hard for in his shows.

01:53:06.860 --> 01:53:10.860
And these weren't simple sponsorships that people could go to if they wanted to,

01:53:10.860 --> 01:53:14.860
these are the places that were offered specifically, and with all this in mind,

01:53:14.860 --> 01:53:20.860
it becomes hard to buy that Dr. Phil had no knowledge whatsoever of the incidents that occurred at many of these places.

01:53:20.860 --> 01:53:25.860
In a way, his response distanced himself far too much to the point where it just was not believable,

01:53:25.860 --> 01:53:30.860
and a more straightforward theory seemed to emerge that shone a much darker light onto the show,

01:53:30.860 --> 01:53:32.860
and how it had been operated.

01:53:38.860 --> 01:53:43.860
Amongst the quagmire of other shows in the genre that regularly sought to put guests on the spot

01:53:43.860 --> 01:53:48.860
in private affairs, indiscretions, and matters that only reserved as entertainment for the baying crowds.

01:53:48.860 --> 01:53:52.860
Dr. Phil stood out to many, a beacon in how topics could be tackled on television.

01:53:52.860 --> 01:53:58.860
Thanks to his skills, McGraw was often able to navigate topics and address guests in ways that appeared fair and astute.

01:53:58.860 --> 01:54:05.860
The pursuit of perfection is, in and of itself, a flawed pursuit, because there is no perfection, you know that.

01:54:05.860 --> 01:54:09.860
Nothing can ever get straight enough, perfect enough, clean enough, right enough.

01:54:09.860 --> 01:54:12.860
Because if it is, you've got to go back and check it, right?

01:54:12.860 --> 01:54:17.860
It didn't just make him popular with audiences, who felt his approach represented a more humanised perspective of guests,

01:54:17.860 --> 01:54:22.860
but also with studios, who were often learning the hard way that such formulas could lead to disaster.

01:54:22.860 --> 01:54:27.860
There has been no large-scale disaster on the Dr. Phil show, nothing that has defined the legacy of the show,

01:54:27.860 --> 01:54:31.860
and as the ratings of competitors dropped, McGraw's ship remained stable.

01:54:31.860 --> 01:54:38.860
The lack of emotional provocation directly from Dr. Phil often meant that people really couldn't do much with actual legal complaints.

01:54:38.860 --> 01:54:44.860
Whatever happened couldn't directly be linked back to an appearance on Dr. Phil, it's not illegal to have guests after all.

01:54:44.860 --> 01:54:50.860
There has to be some level of personal responsibility, something that Dr. Phil has always preached.

01:54:50.860 --> 01:54:57.860
In a lot of tabloid talk shows, their format enabled responsibility for any misconduct to be assigned to the producers and the host,

01:54:57.860 --> 01:55:01.860
because of their language and behaviour that may have affected the actions of these guests,

01:55:01.860 --> 01:55:03.860
not just on the show, but subsequently after the show.

01:55:03.860 --> 01:55:09.860
The public crucifixion many people were often subject to was life-ruining, a fate I wouldn't wish on nearly anyone,

01:55:09.860 --> 01:55:14.860
and when these consequences became apparent, I think a lot of people realised TV needed to change.

01:55:14.860 --> 01:55:19.860
Dr. Phil seemed above that, though, his show seemed to occupy this very neutral sphere,

01:55:19.860 --> 01:55:23.860
where they merely provided a platform for these discussions and interventions to occur.

01:55:23.860 --> 01:55:27.860
Whatever happened otherwise was ultimately the result of decisions made by individuals.

01:55:28.860 --> 01:55:31.860
This reputation was bolstered by Dr. Phil's image and background,

01:55:31.860 --> 01:55:35.860
which often applauded him as a professional voice whose words were rooted in scientific observation.

01:55:35.860 --> 01:55:41.860
Although acknowledging that he was not a medical doctor or even a practicing psychologist, McGraw still leaned into this image,

01:55:41.860 --> 01:55:46.860
with many products, shows, and public appearances that promoted him as a credible voice within the sphere.

01:55:46.860 --> 01:55:52.860
All of this established him as a neutral, mild TV personality who merely wanted to teach people some common sense,

01:55:52.860 --> 01:55:55.860
and his self-titled show followed that formula.

01:55:55.860 --> 01:55:59.860
This perspective was reflected in Dr. Phil's response to Danielle Bregoli.

01:55:59.860 --> 01:56:04.860
All he does on the show is sit there and make observations and recommend the support a person should receive.

01:56:04.860 --> 01:56:08.860
The observation approach prides itself on attempting to dissect these subjects from a factual basis

01:56:08.860 --> 01:56:13.860
and in a way that allows individuals to present themselves in their unfiltered, unprovoked form.

01:56:13.860 --> 01:56:17.860
Now, in principle, it was questionable whether such a format could ever be truly neutral.

01:56:17.860 --> 01:56:22.860
The involvement of an audience, TV cameras, sure, on paper, they're not directly accountable to a studio,

01:56:22.860 --> 01:56:26.860
but they still influence outcomes of possible interventions and discussions

01:56:26.860 --> 01:56:30.860
that would regularly refer to intimate and revealing details broadcast out there for eternity.

01:56:30.860 --> 01:56:36.860
Yet you could defend the show on the basis that there has to be some public exposure for it to constitute a show at all.

01:56:36.860 --> 01:56:40.860
Nevertheless, there were definitely certain hoops they'd have to jump through to retain this defence,

01:56:40.860 --> 01:56:42.860
which is what some began to question.

01:56:42.860 --> 01:56:47.860
First, you have that dynamic of dependence between the guests and the showrunners, then unspoken, assumed debt,

01:56:47.860 --> 01:56:51.860
one that could very easily dictate personal behaviour and commentary on it.

01:56:51.860 --> 01:56:56.860
However, deeper than that, we have the actual alleged conduct undertaken by people working behind the scenes,

01:56:56.860 --> 01:57:00.860
that seemed to challenge their guests and their own personal responsibility for their demons.

01:57:00.860 --> 01:57:04.860
As it's been preached, personal responsibility was extremely important,

01:57:04.860 --> 01:57:08.860
and as far as we know, the crew of Dr. Phil never forced any guest's hand in their actions.

01:57:08.860 --> 01:57:14.860
However, on multiple occasions, the Dr. Phil show appeared to be more orchestrated than those behind it were prepared to admit.

01:57:14.860 --> 01:57:20.860
Their behaviour in attempting to make TV more engaging seemed to announce to nudging certain guests towards detrimental actions,

01:57:20.860 --> 01:57:25.860
not safeguarding vulnerable individuals properly, and prioritising their business deals and spicy stories

01:57:25.860 --> 01:57:29.860
over the actual wellbeing and autonomy of some of those who they covered.

01:57:29.860 --> 01:57:35.860
Each allegation seemed to tell the same story, that although there seemed to be no active sabotage conducted by producers,

01:57:35.860 --> 01:57:39.860
they pushed the responsibility of difficult decisions onto distressed guests to generate conflict,

01:57:39.860 --> 01:57:43.860
which would then be touched on by the surly host, who would hold them accountable.

01:57:44.860 --> 01:57:49.860
I have no excuse. I didn't want her to withdraw. I know that we did try and take her to the hospital,

01:57:49.860 --> 01:57:56.860
and she ended up leaving. I don't have an answer for why I did what I did. I just wanted to help her feel better.

01:57:56.860 --> 01:57:59.860
So you got the heroin, right? How did you take it?

01:57:59.860 --> 01:58:00.860
Injected it.

01:58:00.860 --> 01:58:05.860
So you bought heroin that she pumped into her veins, and therefore into the baby's veins.

01:58:05.860 --> 01:58:06.860
Yes.

01:58:06.860 --> 01:58:08.860
So that baby is high on heroin.

01:58:08.860 --> 01:58:11.860
It's a very curious connection between many of the stories.

01:58:11.860 --> 01:58:15.860
This is not one that people would necessarily consciously concoct to be consistent with other claims,

01:58:15.860 --> 01:58:20.860
but they suggested that the Dr Phil Producers indulged a sweet spot between the show's responsibility,

01:58:20.860 --> 01:58:22.860
and the guests' responsibility.

01:58:22.860 --> 01:58:25.860
Sure, they didn't necessarily make these guest decisions for them,

01:58:25.860 --> 01:58:28.860
but they put them in a position where many of them felt like they had no other option,

01:58:28.860 --> 01:58:32.860
whether that's due to the unspoken dynamic, or the outwardly spoken words.

01:58:32.860 --> 01:58:36.860
Even if it seems like they have a choice, it's almost its own illusion.

01:58:36.860 --> 01:58:38.860
The presence of an audience makes this even more difficult,

01:58:38.860 --> 01:58:41.860
because given almost all of them are likely to be in favour of Dr Phil,

01:58:41.860 --> 01:58:46.860
try his ascent, and you're arguing against a hundred more people who have complete free reign to vocalise those feelings.

01:58:46.860 --> 01:58:49.860
It's not hard to tell which side they're going to take.

01:58:49.860 --> 01:58:55.860
We know the central narrative of a show like this will always aim to present Dr Phil lifting people out of a struggle.

01:58:55.860 --> 01:59:01.860
He has to be their saviour, but they shouldn't have to manipulate scenarios to ensure that a person has a struggle to be lifted out of.

01:59:02.860 --> 01:59:07.860
As their PR guru once said, those people were already encountering difficulties at the time that they arrived.

01:59:07.860 --> 01:59:11.860
What happens at the show may not have too much of a direct bearing on those specific issues,

01:59:11.860 --> 01:59:14.860
yet just because someone is suffering from a problem,

01:59:14.860 --> 01:59:19.860
doesn't mean that an appearance on public television is just like any other Tuesday when addressing it.

01:59:19.860 --> 01:59:22.860
That sort of show can be a make or break situation for a person's wellbeing.

01:59:22.860 --> 01:59:26.860
You see, whereas Greenberg's statement was used to defer responsibility,

01:59:26.860 --> 01:59:28.860
many would use it to bestow greater responsibility.

01:59:28.860 --> 01:59:34.860
Just because someone is fighting their own personal battle doesn't mean you can't provide some reinforcements here or there,

01:59:34.860 --> 01:59:36.860
and you have to make the best TV out of it.

01:59:36.860 --> 01:59:43.860
Although they had established a prestige amongst many viewers as the show that provided the most sincere platform for people to share their struggles,

01:59:43.860 --> 01:59:47.860
their set up enabled a bulletproof formula that would yield the results they wanted,

01:59:47.860 --> 01:59:52.860
reaping the credit for everything that went right without making them too responsible for the things that went wrong,

01:59:52.860 --> 01:59:56.860
exploiting nearly every medium possible to maximise their own success.

01:59:56.860 --> 02:00:03.860
But in spite of its continued success, are the curtains finally coming down on this iconic daytime show?

02:00:11.860 --> 02:00:15.860
The year is 2022, and Dr. Phil has been up and running for 20 seasons.

02:00:15.860 --> 02:00:21.860
It has outlasted nearly every tabloid talk show, a majority of normal talk shows, including Oprah,

02:00:21.860 --> 02:00:23.860
and still pulls significant viewership.

02:00:23.860 --> 02:00:25.860
He must have done something right.

02:00:25.860 --> 02:00:30.860
While in many ways, Dr. Phil achieved a feat unrivalled by nearly every other daytime show,

02:00:30.860 --> 02:00:36.860
regardless of when or how it ends, it will have irrevocably changed many people's lives, for better and sometimes for worse.

02:00:36.860 --> 02:00:41.860
McGraw has influenced multiple generations of people on how they may approach the topics of mental health,

02:00:41.860 --> 02:00:43.860
and many other sensitive subjects surrounding the matter,

02:00:43.860 --> 02:00:47.860
which is probably why people find the show such a hotbed for modern day discussion.

02:00:47.860 --> 02:00:51.860
It's influenced how people seek help, put a face on a lot of unknown conditions,

02:00:51.860 --> 02:00:55.860
and platformed important discussions that were often considered too taboo for mainstream television.

02:01:15.860 --> 02:01:19.860
There's no doubt that many of those subjects covered by Dr. Phil will remain relevant for decades to come,

02:01:19.860 --> 02:01:25.860
but will the man himself be at the forefront of it? With all that's been discussed today, I'm not entirely sure.

02:01:25.860 --> 02:01:31.860
Dr. Phil's venture into the online community definitely gave him and the show a second wind that very few could have predicted.

02:01:31.860 --> 02:01:35.860
It made him relevant with a new audience, and refreshed him in the memory of old ones.

02:01:35.860 --> 02:01:40.860
However, success in the online world does come with the acknowledgement that you don't always have the control of public perception

02:01:40.860 --> 02:01:42.860
that you might have on other mediums.

02:01:42.860 --> 02:01:47.860
It didn't help that at its core, Dr. Phil was still old school syndicated television.

02:01:47.860 --> 02:01:51.860
They didn't really adjust their rules depending on who was watching or talking about them.

02:01:51.860 --> 02:01:54.860
Certain pursuits that became quite easy to criticise were picked up on,

02:01:54.860 --> 02:01:57.860
and even though it was likely fairly standard procedure when the show was launched,

02:01:57.860 --> 02:02:03.860
by this time people clearly realised there had to be somewhat more rigorous moral standards with the content he was producing,

02:02:03.860 --> 02:02:08.860
and when he eventually got involved in the pinnacle of what every online figure dreads, drama,

02:02:08.860 --> 02:02:11.860
his response was clearly taken from the TV template of admitting nothing.

02:02:11.860 --> 02:02:15.860
The only problem was that it just wasn't believable at all.

02:02:15.860 --> 02:02:22.860
In 2018, owing to its continued success, Dr. Phil was nude for an additional four seasons, running up until May 2023.

02:02:22.860 --> 02:02:26.860
This was quite the feat all things considered, however, in the last couple years,

02:02:26.860 --> 02:02:31.860
it has lost its syndicated crown to other shows, including Live with Kelly and Ryan and The View.

02:02:31.860 --> 02:02:37.860
Now, this isn't to say the ratings still haven't been strong, Dr. Phil still pulls a significant viewership all things considered,

02:02:37.860 --> 02:02:43.860
but whereas in March 2020 he was pulling a Nielsen rating of 2.8, by the end of 2021 that had dropped to 1.4,

02:02:43.860 --> 02:02:47.860
and it seems somewhat uncertain if there will be a further extension to the show's lifespan.

02:02:47.860 --> 02:02:52.860
On the basis of the numbers alone, I'd say they have reason to renew, however, on the basis of the trend,

02:02:52.860 --> 02:02:57.860
I'd say they're probably aware of the risk. In August 2022, for the start of Season 21,

02:02:57.860 --> 02:03:02.860
they laid off 25 staffers in a move to cut costs, and although the studio downplayed the move,

02:03:02.860 --> 02:03:07.860
it's hard to ignore such significant downsizing, especially given the stories that had come out over the year before.

02:03:07.860 --> 02:03:12.860
The only real piece of good news for the show came from the result of the lawsuit regarding Turnabout Ranch,

02:03:12.860 --> 02:03:15.860
which Jones dismissed as ultimately not having strong enough grounds to pursue.

02:03:15.860 --> 02:03:20.860
Having probably the most TV company move of them all, the response of the Dr. Phil show was to request the court

02:03:20.860 --> 02:03:25.860
to have the former guest, Archer Letter, pay them $400,000 in legal fees,

02:03:25.860 --> 02:03:28.860
which seems just a bit tasteless considering the sensitivity of the case,

02:03:28.860 --> 02:03:32.860
and the fact that a separate lawsuit against Turnabout Ranch has yet to be concluded.

02:03:32.860 --> 02:03:38.860
But that's just my take, I could point towards one specific story and say that it was the straw that broke the camel's back,

02:03:38.860 --> 02:03:43.860
but really, I think it's just the result of gradual attrition, a formula being worn to the bone,

02:03:43.860 --> 02:03:46.860
and people finally realising it wasn't the TV that it claimed to be.

02:03:46.860 --> 02:03:50.860
I think that back in the day, when it was competing with shows that regularly skewered their guests

02:03:50.860 --> 02:03:55.860
and made the grandest spectacle of each situation, Dr. Phil could be that more humane alternative.

02:03:55.860 --> 02:04:00.860
With the rise of the internet, and Dr. Phil's own participation in it, they found themselves out of step

02:04:00.860 --> 02:04:04.860
with more refined documentaries, and psychological analyses of situations by credited experts

02:04:04.860 --> 02:04:08.860
who treat these topics with much more reverence than Dr. Phil ever did.

02:04:08.860 --> 02:04:12.860
McGraw's show still has the edge in the fact that it often directly involves these subjects,

02:04:12.860 --> 02:04:15.860
and the fact that they can actually offer treatment and coverage of such,

02:04:15.860 --> 02:04:18.860
but that has been overshadowed by the questions surrounding a lot of these treatment centres,

02:04:18.860 --> 02:04:21.860
and Dr. Phil's own relationship with them.

02:04:21.860 --> 02:04:24.860
YouTubers who worked with counselling site BetterHelp came under criticism

02:04:24.860 --> 02:04:28.860
after the company found themselves mired in controversy regarding the status of some professionals,

02:04:28.860 --> 02:04:32.860
and some creators were thought to have not actually used the site they were promoting.

02:04:32.860 --> 02:04:36.860
That is a drop in the ocean compared to what McGraw has appeared to greenlight.

02:04:36.860 --> 02:04:41.860
Lawsuit regarding Turnabout Ranch has also further torn a hole in that previously impenetrable reputation.

02:04:41.860 --> 02:04:46.860
Although lawsuits were not necessarily anything new to Dr. Phil, and certainly this result wasn't,

02:04:46.860 --> 02:04:49.860
the media coverage, the names attached, and the possible precedent that could have been set

02:04:49.860 --> 02:04:52.860
if they had found McGraw and his crew culpable for their recommendation

02:04:52.860 --> 02:04:55.860
is enough to give many studios cold feet.

02:04:55.860 --> 02:04:59.860
This probably wouldn't have even been conceivable when the show started up in the early 2000s,

02:04:59.860 --> 02:05:04.860
with TV the medium, and guests making one or two appearances before being forgotten in the run of episodes.

02:05:04.860 --> 02:05:09.860
With the online world immortalising much of this content, mostly the behest of Dr. Phil's production team,

02:05:09.860 --> 02:05:12.860
their strength of reaching a new audience is also that vulnerability.

02:05:12.860 --> 02:05:17.860
Like a lot of TV shows, and even media in general, Dr. Phil was ahead of its time when it made its debut,

02:05:17.860 --> 02:05:20.860
but has fallen behind the evolving zeitgeist of the years have passed,

02:05:20.860 --> 02:05:24.860
and it seems too resistant to the change it would need to undertake to overcome that.

02:05:24.860 --> 02:05:28.860
Maybe Phil's format just wasn't capable of something more human,

02:05:28.860 --> 02:05:31.860
or maybe it was, but wasn't prepared to make that change.

02:05:31.860 --> 02:05:36.860
I believe I can bring him really quality help, and I think he can respond to that,

02:05:36.860 --> 02:05:39.860
and I think he probably will.

02:05:39.860 --> 02:05:44.860
In principle, I don't think it would be completely impossible to overhaul the current system in place.

02:05:44.860 --> 02:05:48.860
However, I think the issue is that when a show becomes so established over a long period of time,

02:05:48.860 --> 02:05:53.860
it digs its roots in which makes it very difficult for certain changes to be affected.

02:05:53.860 --> 02:05:57.860
The additional problem is that your remaining audience may only be comfortable with your current format,

02:05:57.860 --> 02:06:01.860
so even if your numbers are down currently, you still risk distancing the law of viewers

02:06:01.860 --> 02:06:05.860
by completely renovating the show that so many of those viewers have come to appreciate.

02:06:05.860 --> 02:06:08.860
But is it radical to ask for a bit more humanity?

02:06:08.860 --> 02:06:13.860
Arguably, much of what we discuss today wouldn't necessarily require that many adjustments,

02:06:13.860 --> 02:06:16.860
just a heightened sensitivity and improved safeguarding.

02:06:16.860 --> 02:06:19.860
However, even that may be a bit too much for a show that at its core,

02:06:19.860 --> 02:06:23.860
still thrived on the drama that it superficially seemed to seek distance from.

02:06:23.860 --> 02:06:27.860
And to be brutally honest, maybe that's what people wanted.

02:06:32.860 --> 02:06:34.860
We've discussed this in the past with the Ellen video,

02:06:34.860 --> 02:06:37.860
but one of the aspects of a modern talk show that appeals to so many people

02:06:37.860 --> 02:06:42.860
is this thought that what you're receiving is an unfiltered, authentic version of a person.

02:06:42.860 --> 02:06:44.860
Unfortunately, Hollywood ruins most things,

02:06:44.860 --> 02:06:48.860
and for studios, it often seems easier to manufacture the illusion of an authentic atmosphere

02:06:48.860 --> 02:06:50.860
than to actually craft one organically.

02:06:50.860 --> 02:06:53.860
Yet if people are none the wiser to this assembly, then who can it harm?

02:06:53.860 --> 02:06:57.860
Well in principle, it doesn't have to harm anyone if it's managed correctly.

02:06:57.860 --> 02:07:01.860
The problem is that a formula based on deception doesn't tend to attract the most sincere characters,

02:07:01.860 --> 02:07:05.860
and when you're dealing with topics like mental health, there tends to be more at stake.

02:07:05.860 --> 02:07:08.860
You can't blame audiences for only seeing what they want to see,

02:07:08.860 --> 02:07:12.860
because in truth, they often only see what the TV producers want to see.

02:07:12.860 --> 02:07:16.860
But anything catered to being more realistic would probably undermine the studio's version

02:07:16.860 --> 02:07:19.860
of how authentic such TV shows should appear.

02:07:19.860 --> 02:07:22.860
Every show has an angle, because it's what sells.

02:07:22.860 --> 02:07:25.860
Dr. Phil was often presented as a selfless endeavour,

02:07:25.860 --> 02:07:29.860
an altruistic drive to help people beat their demons and get their lives back on track.

02:07:29.860 --> 02:07:32.860
Finally, a format for a show based around the needs of a guest.

02:07:32.860 --> 02:07:37.860
However, I think over time it became clear to audiences that it wasn't exactly about helping,

02:07:37.860 --> 02:07:39.860
it was more about people believing you're helping.

02:07:39.860 --> 02:07:42.860
We've already addressed how cameras affect the guests on the show,

02:07:42.860 --> 02:07:44.860
but the cameras also affect Dr. Phil,

02:07:44.860 --> 02:07:47.860
and when they were rolling, people received a seemingly measured and earnest persona,

02:07:47.860 --> 02:07:49.860
but a persona nonetheless.

02:07:49.860 --> 02:07:53.860
This was a one-man franchise, anything that threatened that image was quickly dispatched on.

02:07:53.860 --> 02:07:55.860
Good morning to you, Ty.

02:07:55.860 --> 02:07:56.860
Hey, Bump Fights, baby.

02:07:56.860 --> 02:07:58.860
Is that a wig you're wearing?

02:07:58.860 --> 02:07:59.860
No, real hair.

02:07:59.860 --> 02:08:05.860
Real hair, just curious, because I understand you're not using your real name, and I wonder why that is.

02:08:05.860 --> 02:08:10.860
Well, no, Ty Beast is my real name, I'm a film student out of USC,

02:08:10.860 --> 02:08:15.860
and it took three years to put together the footage for the Bump Fights, and now it's out.

02:08:15.860 --> 02:08:17.860
And now the police come calling.

02:08:17.860 --> 02:08:20.860
Well, I'm not worried about it, I don't think I've done anything wrong.

02:08:20.860 --> 02:08:23.860
It's been a long video, but I do have one more story for you.

02:08:23.860 --> 02:08:27.860
Yes, an incident that has acquired internet fame allegedly involving the creator of Bump Fights,

02:08:27.860 --> 02:08:32.860
Ty Beaston, is often pointed to by critics as a perfect example of what we're discussing today.

02:08:32.860 --> 02:08:39.860
Now, I have to warn you, some of this footage that you're about to see is clearly inappropriate for young viewers.

02:08:39.860 --> 02:08:42.860
Please ask your children to leave the room, and I'm serious,

02:08:42.860 --> 02:08:48.860
you really don't want your kids watching this, and it's not gonna be fun for you to see it.

02:08:48.860 --> 02:08:54.860
But we have to be aware of what's floating around out there, and what our kids have access to.

02:08:54.860 --> 02:09:01.860
Bump Fights is a rather grim series of films designed to exploit homeless people by making them participate in often quite dangerous antics,

02:09:01.860 --> 02:09:05.860
and so it made sense that they would be subject to criticism from someone like McGraw,

02:09:05.860 --> 02:09:09.860
who would obviously find such content abhorrent on the grounds of its inhumanity.

02:09:09.860 --> 02:09:13.860
This seemed like the perfect opportunity to pick someone apart for their actions.

02:09:13.860 --> 02:09:14.860
And yet...

02:09:14.860 --> 02:09:18.860
I've made multi-millions off the Bump Fights video series.

02:09:18.860 --> 02:09:21.860
I'm not surprised at my success. It's a sick world.

02:09:21.860 --> 02:09:24.860
Stop the tape. Stop the tape.

02:09:24.860 --> 02:09:26.860
I don't want to talk to you.

02:09:26.860 --> 02:09:27.860
Why not?

02:09:27.860 --> 02:09:30.860
That's despicable. I don't want to talk to you.

02:09:30.860 --> 02:09:37.860
I just watched that footage, and that is absolutely despicable, and I refuse to publicise that.

02:09:37.860 --> 02:09:44.860
In the moment, it seemed that McGraw, so roused by the content he watched, had made an active decision to not indulge this heartless troll,

02:09:44.860 --> 02:09:47.860
a harrowing moment of principle from the Doctor himself.

02:09:47.860 --> 02:09:53.860
He creates this stance, as it's a matter that is clearly very personal to him, as he said he has been homeless too.

02:09:53.860 --> 02:09:56.860
Yet, he's interviewed worse people, hasn't he?

02:09:56.860 --> 02:09:59.860
I mean, what is so exceptional about this guy?

02:10:00.860 --> 02:10:07.860
If you think I exploit people, every time you bring a guest on this show, you exploit them and spread whatever problems they have to the whole world.

02:10:07.860 --> 02:10:09.860
You think that's helping them?

02:10:09.860 --> 02:10:11.860
Yeah, keep telling yourself that. You can go.

02:10:11.860 --> 02:10:14.860
Ah well, you see, he's dressed in rather interesting attire.

02:10:14.860 --> 02:10:18.860
You could go as far as to say him and Dr. Phil, but practically matching suits.

02:10:18.860 --> 02:10:21.860
As that clip just illustrated, it wasn't done without purpose.

02:10:21.860 --> 02:10:27.860
As a matter of fact, it seems Beeson wanted to take the opportunity to make a you and I ain't so different type speech.

02:10:27.860 --> 02:10:31.860
Now, I would say that Bum Fights is somewhat worse than Dr. Phil on the basis of its premise,

02:10:31.860 --> 02:10:34.860
and I think McGraw could have made that case for himself,

02:10:34.860 --> 02:10:39.860
but clearly anticipating that it's an argument he does not want to have, he pulls the plug on the interview.

02:10:39.860 --> 02:10:42.860
Now, this isn't exactly an admission that Beeson is in fact correct,

02:10:42.860 --> 02:10:47.860
but for a man who is so sure-footed on the narratives he propounds and the judgments he makes on other people,

02:10:47.860 --> 02:10:49.860
you'd think he'd be at least able to stand up for himself,

02:10:49.860 --> 02:10:54.860
and yet he can't even answer to the creator or one of the most philistine forms of modern media.

02:10:54.860 --> 02:10:59.860
If it truly was a matter that caused McGraw to feel so strongly to the point where he didn't want to give this guy the time of day,

02:10:59.860 --> 02:11:01.860
he shouldn't have let him on the show in the first place.

02:11:01.860 --> 02:11:07.860
Dismissing the guy when he was actively there before he could even say anything was probably the most cowardly thing to do.

02:11:07.860 --> 02:11:12.860
Phil saw this guy coming and realised it wasn't going to be your usual dunking.

02:11:12.860 --> 02:11:16.860
If it was truly about the people that Dr. Phil sought to help or address,

02:11:16.860 --> 02:11:20.860
he would have no reservations going toe to toe with some of the most questionable figures in modern culture,

02:11:21.860 --> 02:11:23.860
like a lot of the old talk show hosts from the 60s.

02:11:23.860 --> 02:11:29.860
But it's always a question of control for McGraw, and they can't afford an episode which even makes him look remotely out of his depth.

02:11:29.860 --> 02:11:36.860
There has to be a predictability about how these guests are going to behave so that McGraw can assert control over the situation,

02:11:36.860 --> 02:11:39.860
so that if they concur with him, they're engaging positively with his narrative,

02:11:39.860 --> 02:11:44.860
or if they are so bold to try and detract from them, the show has a way to discredit what they say,

02:11:44.860 --> 02:11:47.860
whether they're young, intoxicated, or just mentally unstable.

02:11:47.860 --> 02:11:51.860
The last part I requested more humanity, but humanity is a two-way street,

02:11:51.860 --> 02:11:56.860
and to require more humanity from the show would require more humanity from Dr. Phil,

02:11:56.860 --> 02:12:02.860
and I think it's just too much to ask from a show that has prided itself on having a superhuman host.

02:12:02.860 --> 02:12:04.860
After all, he's just a little sensitive.

02:12:05.860 --> 02:12:10.860
It's the love story of the century, but you've never physically met.

02:12:10.860 --> 02:12:15.860
No, sir. And y'all can laugh at me. Fine. I will be your spectacle. I will be your laughing, laughing spectacle.

02:12:15.860 --> 02:12:16.860
You can all laugh at me. It's fine.

02:12:16.860 --> 02:12:18.860
Well, you know what? I think we're just going to shut this down,

02:12:18.860 --> 02:12:23.860
because I'm not into all this melodrama and you playing the victim and everything,

02:12:23.860 --> 02:12:28.860
so you're saying the audience is making a spectacle out of you.

02:12:28.860 --> 02:12:30.860
That's not what I'm about. That's not what I do.

02:12:30.860 --> 02:12:36.860
I had you come here to help you, and you're saying people are ridiculed, making fun of you,

02:12:36.860 --> 02:12:39.860
you're going to be a spectacle. I don't want to be any part of that.

02:12:39.860 --> 02:12:42.860
I used the word Messiah earlier, and I 100% meant it.

02:12:42.860 --> 02:12:48.860
Dr. Phil's show is structured off making the title character seem like that savior at any and all costs,

02:12:48.860 --> 02:12:53.860
that he is right, but the truth is that nobody, not even a therapist, can fulfill that image,

02:12:53.860 --> 02:12:57.860
and any show that provides that impression is not being honest with its guests or its audience.

02:12:57.860 --> 02:12:59.860
The problem is that when you successfully sell that image,

02:12:59.860 --> 02:13:04.860
not only are you selling an unrealistic expectation of therapy to millions of people,

02:13:04.860 --> 02:13:08.860
you aren't creating a fair environment for a struggling guest to actually find the support they need.

02:13:08.860 --> 02:13:13.860
It means that any actual treatment doesn't have to be catered to the individual, more to a show's agenda,

02:13:13.860 --> 02:13:18.860
and if it doesn't work, you can push responsibility onto the guests for not being receptive enough.

02:13:18.860 --> 02:13:21.860
It's the Seymour Skinner complex that asks you whether your form of therapy didn't work,

02:13:21.860 --> 02:13:24.860
and then concluding that it must be the patient who's wrong.

02:13:24.860 --> 02:13:29.860
It's built off this idea purported to audiences that it's Dr. Phil offering a service to these people,

02:13:29.860 --> 02:13:32.860
when in reality, it's quite the opposite.

02:13:32.860 --> 02:13:35.860
This has just gone in a really bad direction.

02:13:35.860 --> 02:13:38.860
I'm going to talk with Jasmine, I'm going to talk with your mother,

02:13:38.860 --> 02:13:44.860
and I'm just going to let you head on home and go, because I'm not going to play-

02:13:44.860 --> 02:13:47.860
Is there anything I can say to fix this? I'm so sorry.

02:13:47.860 --> 02:13:52.860
No, no, all of this melodrama about ridiculing the audience and they can laugh at you and all that,

02:13:52.860 --> 02:13:59.860
I don't play those kind of games. You're very manipulative, and I just, I'm not interested in all of that.

02:13:59.860 --> 02:14:03.860
Although there would be no show without cameras, and no narrative without the producers,

02:14:03.860 --> 02:14:06.860
there would be no Dr. Phil without the guests.

02:14:06.860 --> 02:14:11.860
They provide the show with years of timeless stories, and harrowing accounts, receiving very little from it in return.

02:14:11.860 --> 02:14:17.860
Their benefit, the hope for recovery, which really should be provided regardless of financial incentive,

02:14:17.860 --> 02:14:20.860
is the least they deserved, and sometimes that wasn't even viable.

02:14:20.860 --> 02:14:24.860
There are so many people, famous celebrities, enshrined through the lens of modern media,

02:14:24.860 --> 02:14:29.860
who could be picked out at their weakest point, and put under that Dr. Phil microscope,

02:14:29.860 --> 02:14:33.860
and the man himself is no exception.

02:14:42.860 --> 02:14:47.860
Cancel culture, it's a phrase that's been used in online circles to nauseating degrees.

02:14:47.860 --> 02:14:50.860
I don't want to go too much into detail about it right now,

02:14:50.860 --> 02:14:55.860
but it's difficult to even give a basic rundown of the definition because there are so many interpretations of it,

02:14:55.860 --> 02:14:58.860
to the point where some people don't even believe it exists.

02:14:58.860 --> 02:15:03.860
I think mainly because this sphere of discussion is dominated by super celebrities who are almost immune

02:15:03.860 --> 02:15:05.860
to ever having their voices silenced anyway.

02:15:05.860 --> 02:15:10.860
However, our good friend Dr. Phil McGraw has been an outspoken critic of it,

02:15:10.860 --> 02:15:13.860
appearing on interviews to call out the harmfulness of the culture,

02:15:13.860 --> 02:15:17.860
but speaking is one thing, does his show reflect that philosophy?

02:15:17.860 --> 02:15:20.860
Well, to many, cancel culture seems like a new phenomenon,

02:15:20.860 --> 02:15:24.860
and the presence of mob mentality online definitely highlights his failings,

02:15:24.860 --> 02:15:28.860
but in many cases, I think it's just a repackaging of something that's long existed,

02:15:28.860 --> 02:15:31.860
and it's not something that affects everybody equally.

02:15:31.860 --> 02:15:36.860
We are in a bubble, we don't want to talk to anyone that doesn't agree with our thinking,

02:15:36.860 --> 02:15:42.860
and if someone says something that is offensive to our sensibilities, then people go on the attack,

02:15:42.860 --> 02:15:49.860
and they may choose a wrong word, and instead of saying, you know, maybe messaging them in some way,

02:15:49.860 --> 02:15:54.860
saying, hey listen, you may not know it, but that could be offensive to someone,

02:15:54.860 --> 02:16:00.860
instead they start bombarding them with boycott messages telling them they hope they die,

02:16:00.860 --> 02:16:05.860
I'm going to slit your throat in the night, I hate, I mean just horrible things.

02:16:05.860 --> 02:16:09.860
In 1988, when McGraw was actually working as a psychologist,

02:16:09.860 --> 02:16:14.860
he was reprimanded and penalised for hiring a former patient of his for part-time employment.

02:16:14.860 --> 02:16:18.860
The patient in question also made claims suggesting inappropriate contact by McGraw,

02:16:18.860 --> 02:16:22.860
however, the board's review did not conclude in the patient's favour on that front.

02:16:22.860 --> 02:16:26.860
For now, I'm not going to comment on that which is disputed, and there are other serious claims against him

02:16:26.860 --> 02:16:29.860
that are tied up in legal proceedings which I won't be exploring today,

02:16:29.860 --> 02:16:35.860
however, I will say that it is Therapy 101 that you do not develop a personal or business relationship

02:16:35.860 --> 02:16:37.860
with one of your patients outside of your practice.

02:16:37.860 --> 02:16:42.860
It's not a healthy dynamic, and the fact that someone seemingly as stoic as McGraw could allow that to happen

02:16:42.860 --> 02:16:46.860
is certainly a stark reminder that TV hosts are not all they represent sometimes.

02:16:46.860 --> 02:16:52.860
Now, that's over 30 years ago, and I think one of the uglier aspects of cancer culture is ruining someone's career

02:16:52.860 --> 02:16:57.860
for historic indiscretions. I believe that broadly speaking, people deserve the chance to grow and change,

02:16:57.860 --> 02:17:00.860
and that ruining someone's livelihood is seldom the solution.

02:17:00.860 --> 02:17:06.860
In his case, the board's solution was for McGraw to be supervised until they were satisfied that their conditions were met.

02:17:06.860 --> 02:17:10.860
To many, this would seem like a fair and proportional response from the board. Would Dr. Phil agree?

02:17:10.860 --> 02:17:17.860
McGraw has been outspoken on the benefits of his show, and even that he believes it's a fair basis for conflict resolution.

02:17:17.860 --> 02:17:21.860
So all I'd ask is this, if McGraw genuinely believes in his own approach to therapy,

02:17:21.860 --> 02:17:27.860
would he have subjected himself to it when he found himself facing serious criticism in 1988?

02:17:27.860 --> 02:17:31.860
Although I can't look inside his mind, my prediction would be a resounding no.

02:17:31.860 --> 02:17:37.860
Why? Because he knows better than anyone that you have very little control over how you're going to be perceived or presented.

02:17:37.860 --> 02:17:43.860
Dr. Phil emphasizes responsibility, but when you as a person have no control over what the TV producers do,

02:17:43.860 --> 02:17:49.860
what Dr. Phil says, or how your own words may even be twisted and used against you, you can't be responsible for that,

02:17:49.860 --> 02:17:53.860
yet you'll believe it because you were the person who chose to go on the show in the first place.

02:17:53.860 --> 02:17:57.860
Audiences can pretend to be better, but if the performance of YouTube videos tell us anything,

02:17:57.860 --> 02:18:01.860
it's that people are much more interested in the deterioration than they are the recovery.

02:18:01.860 --> 02:18:05.860
People are going to be remembered online for decades for often their lowest points in their life,

02:18:05.860 --> 02:18:11.860
will likely be judged for behaviour they may have long corrected, even though in hindsight, the flaws of these shows seemed abundantly clear.

02:18:11.860 --> 02:18:15.860
Most of the longest running shows in this genre, like Springer, Carl, and even Jones,

02:18:15.860 --> 02:18:17.860
were often the most provocative and controversial.

02:18:17.860 --> 02:18:22.860
Many of them were rather gross, relied on stereotypes and tropes related to people's backgrounds or identity,

02:18:22.860 --> 02:18:28.860
and if the same formula was applied with more subtlety with Dr. Phil, it would hardly be surprising as it seems inbuilt with the genre.

02:18:28.860 --> 02:18:34.860
Even beyond the concept alone, the numerous allegations that Dr. Phil producers went out of their way to make people seem worse

02:18:34.860 --> 02:18:40.860
than they actually were on screen, isn't that the core of said culture that McGraw would decry in interviews?

02:18:40.860 --> 02:18:45.860
You see, although I think in many ways, provocative hosts were likely detrimental to guests during their TV appearances,

02:18:45.860 --> 02:18:50.860
it at least gave audiences some idea of how responsibility can be shared in these situations.

02:18:50.860 --> 02:18:56.860
I don't think most people are emotionally unintelligent, I think they can recognise when a frenzied situation arises,

02:18:56.860 --> 02:19:01.860
and it's hard to control. Dr. Phil, on the other hand, built up Randolph being the reasonable guy,

02:19:01.860 --> 02:19:05.860
and it's ingenious optics really, because I think in appearing measured and reasonable,

02:19:05.860 --> 02:19:10.860
he succeeds in making his guests, who are often put on the spot, look much rather like the opposite,

02:19:10.860 --> 02:19:15.860
and if the allegations are true, then in many ways, they were much more insidious in their technique than many other hosts

02:19:15.860 --> 02:19:18.860
who were outwardly, on the surface, more objectionable.

02:19:18.860 --> 02:19:24.860
Everyone looks at social media as the sole cause of cancellation, but TV has been cancelling people for decades,

02:19:24.860 --> 02:19:29.860
whether that be their social standing amongst their peers, or the lives that have been lost due to it.

02:19:29.860 --> 02:19:36.860
It's happened to high profile people who have been forgotten, and low profile people who as far as most of us know, never existed.

02:19:36.860 --> 02:19:41.860
The internet certainly amplifies elements of it, and it's not healthy, but a lot of people have been looking down

02:19:41.860 --> 02:19:46.860
on these people struggling before the internet ever began to have any sort of influence in these people's lives.

02:19:46.860 --> 02:19:51.860
The only way you can come out a winner in the eyes of the audience is if you cooperate with a show's narrative,

02:19:51.860 --> 02:19:55.860
and let the help they offer change you for the better, places like Turnabout.

02:19:55.860 --> 02:19:58.860
It's not authentic though, and some people will fall at that hurdle.

02:19:58.860 --> 02:20:04.860
It's not their fault that an aggressive form of therapy wasn't for them, but the show will sure make it seem like it.

02:20:04.860 --> 02:20:11.860
Framing is everything, we live in an era where people seem to empathise more with fictional characters than real people because of it.

02:20:11.860 --> 02:20:17.860
TV series like Barry or Better Call Saul are far superior psychological analyses of complex characters,

02:20:17.860 --> 02:20:22.860
and sure, it's hard to find people like that for a tabloid talk show, and you might not want to,

02:20:22.860 --> 02:20:28.860
but when there are shows that contextualise mass murderers and the literal devil better than you can a drug addicted teen,

02:20:28.860 --> 02:20:31.860
then maybe you're doing something wrong, and once these people are off your show,

02:20:31.860 --> 02:20:37.860
they can do very little to change that image in an industry that favours large companies with lawyers on retainer.

02:20:37.860 --> 02:20:39.860
Everyone's an actor when they know a camera's on.

02:20:40.860 --> 02:20:41.860
Daily, how are you?

02:20:41.860 --> 02:20:42.860
Um, not good.

02:20:42.860 --> 02:20:43.860
Yeah, why's that?

02:20:43.860 --> 02:20:47.860
I was told that y'all brought someone here that I explicitly said not to bring.

02:20:47.860 --> 02:20:48.860
Yeah, who's that?

02:20:48.860 --> 02:20:50.860
Um, my biological mother.

02:20:50.860 --> 02:20:51.860
Would you like to leave?

02:20:51.860 --> 02:20:52.860
Um.

02:20:52.860 --> 02:20:58.860
Cause you can certainly leave, cause nobody tells me who to put on my show, including you.

02:20:58.860 --> 02:20:59.860
Times are changing though.

02:20:59.860 --> 02:21:04.860
You're on the beaten days where you'd be thrown off or torn apart if you had anything to say against McGraw.

02:21:04.860 --> 02:21:10.860
People who have been subject to grilling on these shows find themselves with a greater platform to finally express their own perspectives,

02:21:10.860 --> 02:21:14.860
ones that would never have been broadcast elsewhere because they didn't fit the narrative.

02:21:14.860 --> 02:21:17.860
People like Bregoli, whose case would have otherwise been lost to the sands of time,

02:21:17.860 --> 02:21:23.860
have been able to use their former notoriety to actually amplify their own voice in discussing their experience on the show,

02:21:23.860 --> 02:21:25.860
and the subsequent treatment they were subjected to.

02:21:25.860 --> 02:21:27.860
Someone like Commentators followed suit.

02:21:27.860 --> 02:21:31.860
YouTuber Jaco has released a very compelling set of videos covering many of these scandals,

02:21:31.860 --> 02:21:35.860
which I definitely recommend, with further strong contributions coming from many corners of the internet.

02:21:35.860 --> 02:21:40.860
It's very valiant for Dr. Phil to start discussing cancel culture now in the way that he has,

02:21:40.860 --> 02:21:46.860
but one can't help thinking where this discussion was when he was publicly roasting parents for not raising children

02:21:46.860 --> 02:21:50.860
as he thought they should in front of millions of viewers, and roasting those children too.

02:21:50.860 --> 02:21:56.860
I don't know what he thinks is so different about the online world that makes his core specifically so righteous.

02:21:56.860 --> 02:22:04.860
Well, guys, it's time for you each to take responsibility for what part of this you own,

02:22:04.860 --> 02:22:12.860
and Diane, you're blaming Ron, and Ron, you're blaming Diane, but let me assure you, nobody,

02:22:12.860 --> 02:22:18.860
nobody is responsible for your feelings and your actions but yourself.

02:22:18.860 --> 02:22:24.860
It's ironic, what could prove to be the Achilles heel of Dr. Phil may be the very responsibility

02:22:24.860 --> 02:22:30.860
that McGraw has continuously advocated for. Once again, one can't help wonder what he would say to himself now

02:22:30.860 --> 02:22:34.860
if he was a guest on his own show, so I guess I'll say it to him.

02:22:34.860 --> 02:22:40.860
Yes, cancel culture is real and can genuinely harm decent people trying to better themselves,

02:22:40.860 --> 02:22:46.860
I'm glad you care about it, but it's a culture that everyone, yourself included, has participated in at some point in their lives.

02:22:46.860 --> 02:22:52.860
Suddenly taking an interest when people have become capable of calling you out seems a bit too coincidental.

02:22:52.860 --> 02:22:57.860
I know it's a trending topic right now, and obviously the phrase has helped amplify the discussion surrounding it,

02:22:57.860 --> 02:23:02.860
but most of Phil's discourse centres around people who clearly haven't been cancelled, alongside interviews with pop culture

02:23:02.860 --> 02:23:06.860
and political loudmouths who use these narratives to actually increase their influence.

02:23:06.860 --> 02:23:14.860
I can't believe how my fellow liberals are behaving, what is liberal about cancelling everybody and anything

02:23:14.860 --> 02:23:17.860
that you don't happen to agree with? It's a complete nonsense.

02:23:17.860 --> 02:23:21.860
Listen, there's been attempts to cancel me before cancel culture was a thing.

02:23:21.860 --> 02:23:24.860
I'm an outspoken conservative, that's something that I'm used to.

02:23:24.860 --> 02:23:29.860
A lot of large celebrities seem to conflate ordinary people having a platform to respond to them,

02:23:29.860 --> 02:23:36.860
maybe sometimes rather unpleasantly, with actual threats to their careers, when in many cases they'll never experience that.

02:23:36.860 --> 02:23:41.860
There are examples where shows and institutes have been pressured to drop certain public figures,

02:23:41.860 --> 02:23:44.860
and those reasons have been tenuous or driven by personal vendettas.

02:23:45.860 --> 02:23:51.860
I have never agreed with that, and I am broadly a free speech person, but even then it seldom targets celebrities,

02:23:51.860 --> 02:23:55.860
often academics, smaller companies, those who can't actually afford to fight for themselves.

02:23:55.860 --> 02:24:00.860
Dr Phil can, it's clear that he has, and it's clear that he will continue to.

02:24:00.860 --> 02:24:05.860
However, his takes on cancel culture aren't those of a psychologist, they're those of someone who simply

02:24:05.860 --> 02:24:10.860
isn't as untouchable as they previously were, but sometimes that is for the best.

02:24:10.860 --> 02:24:16.860
Just like the psychology board's verdict, in 1988 wasn't cancel culture, neither is this.

02:24:22.860 --> 02:24:27.860
At the start of the video, I posed a simple question that was likely being asked by many ambitious producers

02:24:27.860 --> 02:24:29.860
at the time of Dr Phil's first appearance on TV.

02:24:29.860 --> 02:24:35.860
If we combine a talk show host with a specialist in a specific academic area, what would the result be?

02:24:35.860 --> 02:24:40.860
Well, obviously, Dr Phil is only one possible outcome, but from this one little case study,

02:24:40.860 --> 02:24:45.860
I'd say that it yielded an impressive, yet hollow spectacle, one that flaunted all the credentials

02:24:45.860 --> 02:24:50.860
of our servant in question, but had no way to effectively utilize it in a format that maintained a balance

02:24:50.860 --> 02:24:55.860
between entertainment and humanity, instead leaning into the former at the expense of the latter,

02:24:55.860 --> 02:24:59.860
in pursuit of those ratings, but I suppose that's not necessarily a surprise.

02:24:59.860 --> 02:25:04.860
It's what these studios know best, and anything that may allow the competition to have an edge over them

02:25:04.860 --> 02:25:08.860
should be considered as fair game. It's the survival of the fittest environment,

02:25:08.860 --> 02:25:12.860
and it's what keeps a lot of people in their jobs, however, just because it's the natural thing to do,

02:25:12.860 --> 02:25:16.860
it's the right thing to do, and over time, as people's moral compasses have adjusted,

02:25:16.860 --> 02:25:20.860
the format of Dr Phil has become unpalatable with more and more viewers.

02:25:20.860 --> 02:25:25.860
Combined with some allegations that completely contradict the image that Dr Phil would claim to reject,

02:25:25.860 --> 02:25:28.860
and the continued poor responses made by employees and even McGraw himself,

02:25:28.860 --> 02:25:32.860
it's not a surprise that some people are switching off, or switching over.

02:25:32.860 --> 02:25:37.860
Dr Phil taught many how to sympathize with those struggling, but now people are working out how to empathize with them as well.

02:25:37.860 --> 02:25:42.860
Dr Phil taught many how to seek out help, but now many are learning that there are different types of help,

02:25:42.860 --> 02:25:49.860
and that there's never a one-size-fits-all solution. In both cases, it makes Dr Phil's approach seem a little outdated.

02:25:49.860 --> 02:25:53.860
People's understanding of mental health has evolved greatly in the last couple decades, and I'm glad.

02:25:53.860 --> 02:25:57.860
We're garnering a greater understanding of the challenges and troubles that people face.

02:25:57.860 --> 02:26:03.860
Although we still have a long way to go, I think many have begun to understand how public therapy is a bit of an oxymoron.

02:26:03.860 --> 02:26:09.860
It's a difficult topic to navigate, and Dr Phil has likely put a fair few conversations surrounding mental health on the map.

02:26:09.860 --> 02:26:12.860
I don't want to void him of any credit whatsoever.

02:26:12.860 --> 02:26:16.860
We want to live in a world where these topics aren't too difficult to address and pay attention to,

02:26:16.860 --> 02:26:21.860
but we also need to make sure that those people who may be the centre of the discourse can at least represent themselves how they wish to,

02:26:21.860 --> 02:26:26.860
free of narratives that wish to box them in or present a third party as the hero of the situation.

02:26:26.860 --> 02:26:31.860
Dr Phil didn't steal the limelight completely for himself, but it's natural for a TV show to bolster their reputation

02:26:31.860 --> 02:26:35.860
by crediting themselves for the positive stories and outcomes of guests who have appeared on there,

02:26:35.860 --> 02:26:41.860
people saying thank you Dr Phil, and viewers clapping while he strolls around because it's just another day at the office for him,

02:26:41.860 --> 02:26:46.860
and I think the contrast of blaming the guests when something doesn't work out creates a very unsavoury juxtaposition.

02:26:46.860 --> 02:26:52.860
Although there are lots of people and factors that can aid a person's recovery, it's you who has made those changes,

02:26:52.860 --> 02:26:55.860
and you should never let anyone take that credit away from you.

02:26:55.860 --> 02:27:01.860
It's not easy, it's a minefield of shit to navigate that may occasionally challenge you to confront bad habits,

02:27:01.860 --> 02:27:07.860
but even if it's entirely your fault that you landed yourself in shit in the first place and you're merely going back to where you started from,

02:27:07.860 --> 02:27:09.860
it's still worthy of recognition.

02:27:09.860 --> 02:27:15.860
Although it's not the entire story, I do think that to make stories more centred around the people who are actually encountering these struggles,

02:27:15.860 --> 02:27:21.860
you have to decentralise the system that covers these stories, and that's antithetical to the nature of a talk show.

02:27:21.860 --> 02:27:29.860
That's why I think Dr Phil is probably too rigid to make that change, because they'd probably have to scrap the one thing that appealed to audiences in the first place,

02:27:29.860 --> 02:27:37.860
Dr Phil himself. He's a knowledgeable and intelligent individual, but he's part of a system that has fallen behind what a lot of people are looking for,

02:27:37.860 --> 02:27:44.860
and how long he can retain his viewership amongst a manifestation of claims and lawsuits that seem to have greater media presence than ever

02:27:44.860 --> 02:27:46.860
is a question that will only be revealed with time.

02:27:46.860 --> 02:27:53.860
Maybe if Dr Phil does come to an end, we will have some clarity on what happened behind the scenes from people who no longer have a commitment to the show,

02:27:53.860 --> 02:27:55.860
but who knows when that's going to happen.

02:27:55.860 --> 02:28:02.860
It's unclear what the future of the Dr Phil show has in store, but whether it continues for another 20 years or isn't renewed past 2023,

02:28:02.860 --> 02:28:08.860
it's legacy is definitely going to be the source of debate for time to come. However, there are some judgements that can be made.

02:28:08.860 --> 02:28:14.860
At its best, the producers of Dr Phil didn't properly make sure their guests stayed in a safe place as they should have,

02:28:14.860 --> 02:28:20.860
and at their worst, they could have exposed guests to the very vices they were claiming to remedy, very possibly intentionally.

02:28:20.860 --> 02:28:25.860
Now, in most cases, Dr Phil did provide care for people after their appearance, though there are obvious exceptions.

02:28:25.860 --> 02:28:30.860
However, is the help that comes after worth the humiliation and conflict that comes during?

02:28:30.860 --> 02:28:35.860
It's a question worth asking, particularly when that help was structured around its own business model,

02:28:35.860 --> 02:28:43.860
whether that meant shipping celebrities off to facilities and specific places, or sending children to boarding schools or treatment centres in different states.

02:28:44.860 --> 02:28:55.860
Well, it's hard to believe that 21 years ago I made my very first appearance on the Oprah show, and together we launched Dr Phil in 2002.

02:28:55.860 --> 02:29:00.860
And it does sadden me in a way, because in watching a lot of episodes, I have seen the positive changes made by the show.

02:29:00.860 --> 02:29:07.860
I have seen people genuinely find the help they need, I have seen some really harrowing interviews with people who have been through hell.

02:29:07.860 --> 02:29:11.860
Dr Phil isn't this universal negative, and I don't want to make it out to be that,

02:29:11.860 --> 02:29:15.860
but it is a product of an era that isn't as human as it needs to be.

02:29:15.860 --> 02:29:20.860
I said at the start that as preached on the show, the first step to making a change in your life is acknowledging responsibility,

02:29:20.860 --> 02:29:27.860
something that many of us have done, but something that many of these shows seem to be allergic to, possibly for legal reasons, I don't know for sure.

02:29:27.860 --> 02:29:34.860
Maybe for that reason, they'll never evolve, but I do want to give some words of advice in the instance that that is something they're interested in.

02:29:34.860 --> 02:29:39.860
If it wants to at least try and keep up with the changing zeitgeist, there needs to be changes.

02:29:39.860 --> 02:29:46.860
This isn't 2002 anymore, there should be more diligence about how guests are treated on and off the show, and how the show presents their stories.

02:29:46.860 --> 02:29:52.860
They shouldn't let guests put themselves at risk with substances and alcohol in their care, regardless of the TV that it may engender.

02:29:52.860 --> 02:29:56.860
They shouldn't crucify teens and youngsters because they're behaving badly.

02:29:56.860 --> 02:30:01.860
If they want to make a positive difference, put some money aside towards their treatment, and protect their identities a little better.

02:30:02.860 --> 02:30:10.860
They're troubled as anyone, and crafting narratives about how they're the offspring from hell only boxes in their image and challenges them to rebel at one of the most rebellious points in their lives.

02:30:10.860 --> 02:30:15.860
How they can think that helps is beyond me, and it's definitely something that needs to change in my opinion.

02:30:15.860 --> 02:30:18.860
Whether they choose to take that advice is their decision.

02:30:18.860 --> 02:30:22.860
I'm sure McGraw and all will be living alright either way if their net worth is anything to go by,

02:30:22.860 --> 02:30:27.860
but if they also care about the wellbeing of their guests, it might just be worth considering.

02:30:27.860 --> 02:30:31.860
Doctor Phil McGraw, and all those behind Doctor Phil, did something unprecedented.

02:30:31.860 --> 02:30:37.860
They took tabloid talk shows to the next level, and showed many in the genre that there could be a more dignified element,

02:30:37.860 --> 02:30:41.860
but not every episode had to end with some sort of route.

02:30:41.860 --> 02:30:48.860
However, by holding on to some of the more tabloid aspects of the original formula, they eventually fell into the same pitfalls that many other shows of their time had.

02:30:48.860 --> 02:30:56.860
Where they'll be remembered for those pitfalls, or their success stories, is something only time will tell, and maybe they still have time to change that.

02:30:56.860 --> 02:31:02.860
But it's something whose extent we'll probably only fully know when Doctor Phil is cancelled.

02:31:02.860 --> 02:31:08.860
The show that is, not the person. You know, that was the pun. I'm really funny.

02:31:14.860 --> 02:31:22.860
So yeah, that was the video. Hope you enjoyed. Took a bit to come together, but did come together in the end, and that's what matters.

02:31:23.860 --> 02:31:31.860
Not too much to discuss today, but I did want to mention one thing. Currently, we're doing a little charity thing on the merchandise website.

02:31:31.860 --> 02:31:37.860
Selling some items. Obviously, Christmas is a lovely time for a lot of people, but not for everyone.

02:31:37.860 --> 02:31:41.860
My mother put some nice designs together, and we thought, why not?

02:31:41.860 --> 02:31:48.860
So with some of these charity jobs, obviously there is the concern that others are taking a cut, and obviously there are costs for the production of the shirts.

02:31:48.860 --> 02:31:55.860
What I'm going to do is donate the difference, so that how much you pay for the products is how much is being donated.

02:31:55.860 --> 02:32:00.860
And you get something for it as well, which may have some utility in your life.

02:32:00.860 --> 02:32:07.860
It's better than buying the new lad baby single. And for the Americans who do not understand their reference, ignorance is bliss, my friends.

02:32:07.860 --> 02:32:09.860
Ignorance is bliss.

02:32:09.860 --> 02:32:16.860
I'd also like to thank the editors. Credits will be in the pinned comment below. I said description last time, I'm not sure why.

02:32:16.860 --> 02:32:24.860
I had a bit of a moment. I also need to give a big thanks to the patrons, $10 patrons on screen right now.

02:32:24.860 --> 02:32:31.860
Big thanks to my $50 patrons, Hypercube, Esther Bedoya, Velorex, and Seri Tisch.

02:32:31.860 --> 02:32:34.860
Thank you very much for your support, it means a lot.

02:32:34.860 --> 02:32:41.860
Also, big thanks to the artists whose work contributed to this video. Credits as well below in the pinned comment.

02:32:41.860 --> 02:32:44.860
If your art appears here, be sure to let me know.

02:32:44.860 --> 02:32:50.860
Thanks to vidIQ for sponsoring the video, it was genuinely great to work with them as I did use their app as a smaller creator.

02:32:50.860 --> 02:33:00.860
Not too much else to add, big thanks to Starfur for his work on the thumbnail, and Kojak to help put this video together and get it out in a timely fashion.

02:33:00.860 --> 02:33:09.860
Not sure what else I have to say, I hope you guys have a good festivities wherever you are and whatever you're going through.

02:33:09.860 --> 02:33:11.860
Take care guys, take care.

02:33:11.860 --> 02:33:15.860
Until then, I'll see you in the next one.
