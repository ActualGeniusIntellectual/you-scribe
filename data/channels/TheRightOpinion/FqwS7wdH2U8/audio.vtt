Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time.

00:11.000 --> 00:13.000
What is this?

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
Um...

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
What is this?

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
What the hell is this?

00:48.000 --> 00:49.000
Uh...

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
I don't know...

01:00.000 --> 01:04.000
All works. It's getting cancelled on Twitter.

01:30.000 --> 01:41.000
Wow, that's good!

02:00.000 --> 02:17.000
Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time.

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
And of all the features that are guaranteed to come with internet fame,

02:20.000 --> 02:23.000
few are more certain than the existence of fans and followers.

02:23.000 --> 02:28.000
After all, in many cases, the loyalty of those people is what helped you acquire that status in the first place.

02:28.000 --> 02:32.000
However, as much as fans and their behaviour may exert an influence on you, it's a two-way street,

02:32.000 --> 02:36.000
and the way you present yourself will often define the fanbase you have as well.

02:36.000 --> 02:41.000
This is hardly a groundbreaking discovery, just as every TV show has a target demographic,

02:41.000 --> 02:45.000
every political figure has supporters who likely share many common ideological standpoints,

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
it's nothing to be alarmed about.

02:47.000 --> 02:52.000
At the same time, one of the most pressing and burdening questions I see asked is how accountable one can be

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
for the actions of their audience.

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
First of all, it's challenging enough to manage your own online persona,

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
let alone that of the masses who view your content.

02:59.000 --> 03:02.000
However, it's definitely become a more pertinent conversation of recent,

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
typified by the rise of a certain creator called Dream.

03:05.000 --> 03:09.000
You may have heard of him, if not, I'll give you a brief rundown now.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
Dream is a Minecraft YouTuber.

03:11.000 --> 03:15.000
He started his channel in 2014, assuming the moniker of Dream Traps,

03:15.000 --> 03:19.000
and although it didn't take him too long to hit 1,000 subs, his channel stagnated after that,

03:19.000 --> 03:23.000
and although he's on record doing a little gaming with his friends and interacting on Twitter,

03:23.000 --> 03:27.000
these few years seemed pretty uneventful by a YouTuber standard.

03:27.000 --> 03:31.000
However, this all changed in 2019, where Minecraft was experiencing a bit of a

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
renaissance amongst online communities and creators alike.

03:34.000 --> 03:38.000
So this little game called Minecraft is popular again.

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
Minecraft, I know what everyone's thinking right now.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
Everyone's playing Minecraft right now.

03:43.000 --> 03:47.000
However, it was also a refreshed sense of interest, not necessarily based on nostalgia,

03:47.000 --> 03:53.000
and this created a gap for new creators to rise up and fill the increased demand for Minecraft-based content.

03:53.000 --> 03:58.000
Dream was one of those eager creators, and he wasn't just any old chump mooching off its popularity,

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
he was a seasoned and experienced patron of the game,

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
and his skills were regularly showcased in the content he produced,

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
which often revolved around challenges that tested his in-game ability,

04:06.000 --> 04:09.000
as well as his rather popular Minecraft Manhunt series.

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
Although he wasn't regarded as a force of personality,

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
his proficiency with the game at hand was highly admirable,

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
and as more people tuned in, his channel picked up momentum,

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
though I'm not sure anyone could have predicted where he would be today.

04:25.000 --> 04:30.000
You see, in the space of two years, he went from 1000 subscribers or so to over 20 million,

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
which I think is what some would call blowing up.

04:33.000 --> 04:37.000
He streams with a crew known as the Dream Team, which includes old and new friends alike.

04:37.000 --> 04:41.000
He uploads on a semi-regular basis, and has very successful side-hustles.

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
It would be fair to take a glance at his channel and say he's doing alright for himself,

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
but is this the full story?

04:46.000 --> 04:51.000
Such a great amount of success in such a short amount of time is certainly a lot to adjust to,

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
alongside the increased sense of influence and responsibility you hold.

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
However, it's nothing that creators aren't used to, is it?

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
Well, I want to introduce a new feature of YouTube stardom,

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
that being what many regard as stan culture.

05:15.000 --> 05:19.000
Many of you probably wonder what the basics are surrounding this.

05:19.000 --> 05:23.000
The term is derived from the infamous Eminem song stan, short for stalker fan,

05:23.000 --> 05:28.000
the one about an obsessed fan who goes postal when Marshall doesn't immediately return the affection

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
that the title character bestows onto the rapper.

05:30.000 --> 05:34.000
It's a pretty great, but also deeply uncomfortable portrayal of fan-idle relationships,

05:34.000 --> 05:39.000
and a stark reminder of how obsession and attachment can manifest themselves in very ugly ways.

05:39.000 --> 05:43.000
Nowadays, however, it doesn't seem to quite carry the grave implications,

05:43.000 --> 05:47.000
but still refers to those who may be slightly overzealous in their support for popular figures.

05:47.000 --> 05:51.000
Twitter has been fertile grounds for such a culture to manifest itself,

05:51.000 --> 05:56.000
often following renowned celebrities such as Ariana Grande, Nicki Minaj, and of course the K-pop genre,

05:56.000 --> 06:02.000
most notably the household name BTS, who have definitely spawned some of the most passionate devotees.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
I can see the gifts now.

06:04.000 --> 06:08.000
This can be quite controversial, and there have been a considerable number of situations

06:08.000 --> 06:12.000
which have involved celebrities distancing themselves from the social media platform

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
due to antics attributed to these communities.

06:14.000 --> 06:18.000
With that said, there hasn't been too much direct involvement from the targets of their affection,

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
as is the case with most celebrities.

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
They make the music, the media appearances, they do their job,

06:23.000 --> 06:27.000
but they don't tend to be outspoken on issues like this unless they view it as absolutely essential.

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
PR is a tightrope, and most walk it without swaying.

06:30.000 --> 06:35.000
However, as I've said many times before, YouTubers tend to have a more intimate relationship with their audience,

06:35.000 --> 06:41.000
they tend to be more interactive, and the online platform makes them feel at least a bit closer to us than the traditional personage.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
So what happens when you put the two together?

06:43.000 --> 06:46.000
Well, that's the question that rid itself with our friend Dream here.

06:46.000 --> 06:50.000
But why? Stands have been around forever, even before we had a name for them,

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
there have been communities set up to champion other creators.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
I should note, I've been to a James Merrick meet and greet.

06:56.000 --> 07:00.000
Yet as Dream's viewership continued to balloon, his stand-in grew respectively,

07:00.000 --> 07:04.000
eventually procuring a consciousness of its own, and even a little title,

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
the deity twit, I don't know exactly how to pronounce that,

07:07.000 --> 07:13.000
but one which, to say the least, was certainly quite ardent in its support of the newfangled internet sensation.

07:13.000 --> 07:17.000
To be honest, it was quite unique how invested many people seem to be, but it's pretty harmless.

07:17.000 --> 07:24.000
In fact, most of the time, being part of a community like that merely constitutes of lending your undivided support to a creator and their ventures,

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
and if you want to go and support someone in such a way, then I don't think anyone should obstruct that,

07:27.000 --> 07:33.000
and to be honest, if a creator is more involved with their audience, that can regularly be quite a positive and rewarding experience.

07:33.000 --> 07:39.000
There's one caveat though, and that's YouTube drama, an omnipresent facet of this delightful sight.

07:39.000 --> 07:43.000
Someone of Dream's status with the level of influence he had, with his astronomical rise to fame,

07:43.000 --> 07:48.000
was going to be subject to significant levels of pressure, and dare I say it, controversy,

07:48.000 --> 07:51.000
whether he was an outwardly tendentious figure or not.

07:51.000 --> 07:58.000
Devoted stans, a large YouTuber, an internet drama, I mean, what could possibly happen?

07:59.000 --> 08:06.000
Well, let's find out. Ladies, gentlemen, everyone, I suggest we begin. Insert Dream becoming nightmare punchline here.

08:20.000 --> 08:24.000
How one interacts with their fans, in general, is a philosophy personal to that creator,

08:24.000 --> 08:29.000
and plenty of YouTubers have different ways of approaching it. Some are very involved in the communities that surround them,

08:29.000 --> 08:33.000
others prefer to maintain a degree of separation. Like everything, there's a popular spectrum,

08:33.000 --> 08:38.000
you don't want to be too far away from your audience to the point where you don't really understand what they want or what they expect of you,

08:38.000 --> 08:43.000
at the same time, you don't want to be too close to them to the point that you foster toxic parasocial relationships.

08:43.000 --> 08:47.000
When you think of Minecraft, and you think of the average Minecraft enjoyer,

08:47.000 --> 08:52.000
many likely imagine the kid with a creeper t-shirt and a diamond pickaxe toy that isn't even made of diamond,

08:52.000 --> 08:58.000
and to be honest, it wouldn't surprise me if a majority of Dream's YouTube following was at least somewhat comprised of that demographic.

08:58.000 --> 09:04.000
However, go on Twitter and you'll see quite a contrasting portrait, and certainly not that stereotypically associated with Minecraft.

09:04.000 --> 09:09.000
One thing I mentioned at the start when talking about a fanbase is that it is often influenced by the creator themselves,

09:09.000 --> 09:18.000
however, stans don't necessarily play by the same rules. Now, of course, I don't doubt that many do hold a legitimate interest in the genre that Dream finds himself in.

09:18.000 --> 09:26.000
However, stans are often characterised online more by their pattern of their behaviour towards the creator rather than their specific interest in the content itself.

09:26.000 --> 09:33.000
These will often involve tweets, threads, fancams, edits, fanfictions, all that jazz which reclaims their love for the creator in question.

09:33.000 --> 09:37.000
A lot of stans, particularly ones in online communities, are also known for their social sensitivity.

09:37.000 --> 09:43.000
Now, this isn't a casual statement as I've had friends who've been subject to the surprising amounts of, insert phobic here,

09:43.000 --> 09:51.000
harassment when even saying the slightest criticism against a kpop group, but generally speaking, online stans are more committed to social causes than the average fanbase.

09:51.000 --> 09:57.000
They also have a stronger sense of community and identity, and are a bit more robust in where they stand ideologically.

09:57.000 --> 10:01.000
Minecraft, on the other hand, has been traditionally associated with your stereotypical gamer,

10:04.000 --> 10:10.000
many of whom are not particularly political at all, and others who certainly possess somewhat questionable ideas.

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
You're probably all aware of Minecraft creator Notch's takes by now.

10:13.000 --> 10:19.000
It's an interesting intersection, and probably part of the reason that stans have never really been traditionally associated with that genre.

10:19.000 --> 10:22.000
Now, this doesn't mean the creators they had followed didn't dabble in Minecraft,

10:22.000 --> 10:27.000
that was probably what switched many of the stan community onto Minecraft creators in the first place,

10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
but Dream was a distilled MC gamer, and a pretty decent one at that.

10:30.000 --> 10:36.000
With that said, a stans elevator commitment to a creator regardless of genre makes them pretty versatile in who they can support,

10:36.000 --> 10:40.000
and they had chosen their king, but let's talk about that said king in person.

11:06.000 --> 11:17.000
As said, he's a very skilled Minecraft player, and he was never an outwardly unpleasant person,

11:17.000 --> 11:23.000
he wasn't overtly bigoted, and although we'll discuss some curious takes in due course, there was no obvious reason to hate him.

11:23.000 --> 11:28.000
However, he also wasn't the most diplomatic person, and he definitely had a very competitive streak to him,

11:28.000 --> 11:32.000
with a dashing assault on the side. Now, I don't think his attitude was particularly exceptional,

11:32.000 --> 11:35.000
as a matter of fact, I think him and I are quite similar in that regard,

11:35.000 --> 11:38.000
but the difference is, in spite of the fact that I am a massive gamer,

11:41.000 --> 11:47.000
I don't ground my persona in playing online games, nor do I think I have an audience who would take my in-game passion particularly seriously,

11:47.000 --> 11:50.000
because you really shouldn't.

11:50.000 --> 11:54.000
Stans on the other hand, can be very serious, and there are a plethora of reasons for this,

11:54.000 --> 11:58.000
partly because of who they are, they may be young, they may re-tone differently,

11:58.000 --> 12:01.000
or they may just want to show their commitment to their beloved creator.

12:01.000 --> 12:05.000
There are people in an array of fandoms who vie for the approval of their heroes,

12:05.000 --> 12:09.000
to even receive moments of recognition for their devotion to that icon.

12:09.000 --> 12:14.000
That leads people to actions that may not necessarily be viewed as healthy or productive to the world around them,

12:14.000 --> 12:17.000
or other people in pursuit of a Twitter reply.

12:17.000 --> 12:23.000
Plenty of studies published have documented traits exhibited by those who engage in celebrity worship of any kind.

12:23.000 --> 12:26.000
On one hand, you'll have people who are a bit more connected to reality,

12:26.000 --> 12:30.000
on the other, you'll have people who believe that if these celebrities saw them in a restaurant,

12:30.000 --> 12:34.000
they'd come and sit down for a chat. Many want to believe that.

12:34.000 --> 12:38.000
Now as noted, celebrities often have limited scope in acknowledging public support,

12:38.000 --> 12:41.000
rather than a few generalised statements about how much they love you guys.

12:41.000 --> 12:44.000
I discussed that spectrum which many YouTubers occupy,

12:44.000 --> 12:49.000
and although some certainly express affection for their devotees, many still maintain a professional distance.

12:49.000 --> 12:54.000
Dream wasn't of that persuasion, he'd always conveyed gratitude to those he felt responsible for his success,

12:54.000 --> 12:57.000
and that definitely encompassed many within the stan community.

12:57.000 --> 13:03.000
He was also just extremely active and interactive on Twitter, which enabled plenty of positive exchanges with his supporters.

13:03.000 --> 13:07.000
He'd engage with them, make them feel valued, wanted part of a greater movement,

13:07.000 --> 13:10.000
and for the earlier part, his time in the spotlight was quite blissful.

13:13.000 --> 13:17.000
Dream's relationship with his audience was tight-knit, and for every positive interaction they had,

13:17.000 --> 13:21.000
he gave people more reasons to support him, he made it a rewarding experience.

13:21.000 --> 13:24.000
To the average fan, there were a lot of perceptible benefits to stanning Dream.

13:24.000 --> 13:29.000
Pair this with the natural yet impressive growth of this channel, and it seemed like a recipe for mutual success was brewing.

13:29.000 --> 13:33.000
However, it's a two-sided coin, because although Dream was hot shit and he kinda knew he was,

13:33.000 --> 13:38.000
the problem is that when that's undermined or challenged, it can regularly cause an emotional response.

13:38.000 --> 13:43.000
Now that emotional response from someone like Dream wouldn't inherently have any repercussions,

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
in fact amongst friends, it can often be laughed off.

13:45.000 --> 13:48.000
The problem is that when you involve people who don't have that context,

13:48.000 --> 13:51.000
nor that necessary understanding of how to handle situations,

13:51.000 --> 13:58.000
a ripple effect occurs where any sort of negativity is amplified because those more devoted want their commitment to go unparalleled,

13:58.000 --> 14:02.000
especially when dealing with drama, but so far we haven't really had any of that.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
Let's introduce it then.

14:10.000 --> 14:13.000
There has always been discourse over the healthiness of stan mentality,

14:13.000 --> 14:16.000
but it's never been particularly targeted, and if you want to go back to his early prosperity,

14:16.000 --> 14:20.000
many wouldn't even pay mind to this, but his excitement for Dream reached fever pitch,

14:20.000 --> 14:24.000
this often spilled onto other creators and communities who were not the most enthusiastic about it.

14:24.000 --> 14:27.000
The problem is that it's not just Dream that's closer to the communities,

14:27.000 --> 14:31.000
it's all of Dream's friends, collaborators, associates, anyone he interacts with at all,

14:31.000 --> 14:34.000
even people just in the outer fringes of the genre.

14:34.000 --> 14:39.000
Unlike many normal human beings, not all of Dream's online exchanges were as wholesome as one may idealise,

14:39.000 --> 14:44.000
and as it persists, people begin to notice, and equate a lot of the worst antics to Dream and his fanbase.

14:44.000 --> 14:50.000
This began to emerge at the end of summer 2020, when there was a flurry of incidents attributed to Dream stans,

14:50.000 --> 14:53.000
particularly relating to other creators, and how they often mixed with each other.

14:53.000 --> 14:59.000
This pattern of behaviour that they were often associated with wasn't met warmly by YouTubers or their respective communities.

14:59.000 --> 15:03.000
Now when you're dealing with stans with certain celebrities, I'd argue that they have the capacity to behave

15:03.000 --> 15:07.000
with a lot more toxicity than Dream's audience ever did, especially towards other artists,

15:07.000 --> 15:13.000
but once again, that disconnect often distances both parties from possible consequences such toxicity may yield.

15:13.000 --> 15:18.000
This is not the same with YouTubers, and Twitch streamers who often invested heavily in their platforms,

15:18.000 --> 15:21.000
and are much more likely to use them to voice their opinion.

15:21.000 --> 15:24.000
They've got arrows, so they're shooting.

15:24.000 --> 15:27.000
This is not a dead end, you're fine.

15:31.000 --> 15:34.000
Oh, Technoblade!

15:35.000 --> 15:40.000
You fools! You fools! You messed with the wrong man!

15:40.000 --> 15:45.000
He's a YouTuber called Technoblade. He is known to collaborate with Dream, having what many describe as a friendly rivalry,

15:45.000 --> 15:50.000
emphasis on the friendly. Towards the back end of August, he competed in a duel against our Minecraft overlord here,

15:51.000 --> 15:57.000
it was hosted by our good friend MrBeast, and in typical beastly fashion, the winner would take home $100,000,

15:57.000 --> 16:02.000
and the title of best Minecraft player, a very objective denomination if I say so myself.

16:02.000 --> 16:07.000
Three hearts! No! Oh no! Dream down! No! Dream!

16:07.000 --> 16:14.000
Okay, the tides are turning, the tides are- No! What? No way! No way! No!

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
No! My goodness!

16:17.000 --> 16:23.000
Bro, no way! Oh no! Technoblade, you animal!

16:23.000 --> 16:29.000
In what was seen by some as a bit of an upset, Technoblade had the audacity to defeat Daddy Dream,

16:29.000 --> 16:35.000
and with his pride somewhat dented at that point in time, Dr. Eamon passed a few off-hand comments during his post-mortem.

16:35.000 --> 16:39.000
He ran and was just running around the rock in a circle, and I literally just couldn't do anything.

16:39.000 --> 16:45.000
He was just running around in a circle until he healed, and then we fought again and he beat me by one heart.

16:47.000 --> 16:54.000
I think he said it too, but depending on the day, it could have gone either way.

16:54.000 --> 17:00.000
It just depends on the day, how they do. They get the lucky rod, the lucky bowshot, the lucky combo, whatever.

17:02.000 --> 17:05.000
He won, and I think that's amazing.

17:06.000 --> 17:12.000
I'm impressed, I'm impressed with Techno. I think 1.16, he impressed me, and 1.8, he impressed me.

17:12.000 --> 17:16.000
I fought a bunch of insane 1.8 players on 1.14, and just never lost to them.

17:16.000 --> 17:21.000
And then they're sitting there like, wow, 1.16 is insane.

17:21.000 --> 17:26.000
So I think people don't realise how impressive it is that Techno won against me.

17:26.000 --> 17:30.000
In a similar vein, many of Dream's more ardent viewers sprung to the defence of their liege,

17:30.000 --> 17:34.000
with many proclaiming their annoyance and disappointment, with a few going to more extreme lengths,

17:34.000 --> 17:37.000
providing ample fuel for a variety of compilation videos.

17:37.000 --> 17:41.000
Techno never commented on this himself, splitting the money with Dream as part of their pre-Duel agreement,

17:41.000 --> 17:44.000
hopefully also signalling the absence of any bad blood.

17:44.000 --> 17:48.000
Nonetheless, it provoked discourse within the Reddit and Twitter communities in particular,

17:48.000 --> 17:51.000
with some expressing frustration at Dream's own behaviour,

17:51.000 --> 17:54.000
and questioning how his own attitude could influence that of his audience.

17:54.000 --> 17:58.000
A few more clips then also began circulating about other creators who'd had their own run-ins,

17:58.000 --> 18:01.000
with the more passionate factions of Dream's followers.

18:01.000 --> 18:07.000
I didn't know anybody there, I only knew Crenios and I guess Dream through association.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
That's healthy.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.000
Did you say who?

18:10.000 --> 18:13.000
So I looked at one of their channels and none of them liked me.

18:13.000 --> 18:16.000
None of them liked me because I killed Dream one time.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
I know that feel, I know that feel, Connor.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
I know that feeling too.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
So I was like, man, I'd rather not go to bed.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.000
Did people get angry?

18:23.000 --> 18:26.000
This in turn led to some questioning Dream's own failure to moderate his own fanbase,

18:26.000 --> 18:29.000
with some even proposing that they be disciplined,

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
though I'm not sure how that would be enforced.

18:31.000 --> 18:34.000
However, it seems these pleas mostly fell on deaf ears at the time,

18:34.000 --> 18:37.000
as many reported in the next few days that creators, including Dream,

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
had their names published and shared online,

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
and one guy by the name of Tubbo, a 16-year-old creator,

18:41.000 --> 18:45.000
who'd received death threats after making a statement in-stream about ACAP,

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
that being All Cops Are Bastards.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
What does that even mean?

18:49.000 --> 18:52.000
So it's basically about all cops are bad?

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
No, all cops are bastards.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
That's just not true.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.000
Yeah?

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
What are you doing?

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
Where you going?

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
Oh, yeah, no, don't say that, Tubbo.

19:06.000 --> 19:10.000
I think it's more, I don't think it means the individual cops,

19:10.000 --> 19:13.000
I think it more is referring to the idea of the police state,

19:13.000 --> 19:17.000
and how, like, the idea of police.

19:17.000 --> 19:20.000
You shouldn't say that if you don't know enough about it, Tubbo.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
Oh.

19:21.000 --> 19:22.000
It's fine, it's fine.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
I mean, in the UK, they're great.

19:23.000 --> 19:26.000
Now, it's important to note that these debates were also internal,

19:26.000 --> 19:29.000
and many stans were concerned about these issues as well,

19:29.000 --> 19:33.000
but the problem was that discourse never really resulted in any proper change,

19:33.000 --> 19:36.000
because there were plenty of people ready to deny, or at least downplay this,

19:36.000 --> 19:41.000
and the problem with that toxic minority is that they're often the most influential ambassadors of a community,

19:41.000 --> 19:45.000
because they are louder, hence why they are referred to as the vocal minority,

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
and as people have negative experiences with them,

19:47.000 --> 19:50.000
they then create a mental image in their head of what this community is like,

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
whether that image is accurate or not,

19:52.000 --> 19:55.000
then that begins to spread and manifest into something new,

19:55.000 --> 19:58.000
and what was formerly this wholesome movement begins to contort itself,

19:58.000 --> 20:02.000
and you really need someone like Dream, the figurehead of this, to speak to common sense.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.000
Did he though?

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
Dream is quite active on his reddit,

20:05.000 --> 20:09.000
and did actually respond to some who he believed were interpreting his actions somewhat uncharitably,

20:09.000 --> 20:14.000
clarifying that he was merely taking an analytical stance on the situation rather than trying to make excuses.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
This is a fair response,

20:16.000 --> 20:19.000
at the end of the day, I'm sure both players in the duel had the capacity to win,

20:19.000 --> 20:24.000
and whether he was assigning too much responsibility onto circumstance over ability is besides the point.

20:24.000 --> 20:27.000
I don't think he was unreasonable, whether you agree with him or not,

20:27.000 --> 20:32.000
he also placed his continued commitment to discouraging malefactions from users within his community,

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
referring to a stream where he did indeed mention it.

20:34.000 --> 20:37.000
Dream- I'd like, probably my, I don't want to say my community is more toxic,

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
but I think my community probably is more toxic.

20:39.000 --> 20:44.000
Dream- Ooh, why don't you stick the knife in a harder and twisted Dream?

20:44.000 --> 20:50.000
Dream- But I wouldn't want, I think that if I had won, people, I mean Techno would have never heard the end of it,

20:50.000 --> 20:53.000
and I think, if he won, I think-

20:53.000 --> 20:57.000
Dream- Aw, that's such a nice thought, okay, I see what you're saying.

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
Techno- That's why I said I think it's part of the problem.

20:59.000 --> 21:02.000
Admittedly, an aside on a stream isn't exactly the most potent statement,

21:02.000 --> 21:05.000
in fact it was more like an acknowledgement rather than a request to his viewers,

21:05.000 --> 21:08.000
but you can't expect him to make a tweet and video every five minutes.

21:08.000 --> 21:12.000
In Dream's position, he wouldn't necessarily want to make a big deal out of it anyway,

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
because it would probably just yield more conflict,

21:14.000 --> 21:17.000
and at this point, it wasn't worth the drama.

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
However, it should have been a warning worth heeding,

21:19.000 --> 21:23.000
if Dream was leaving all those disclaimers as he said he was, and nothing was happening,

21:23.000 --> 21:27.000
it was a sign that it was going to take a bit more to suppress the action of his supposed fans.

21:27.000 --> 21:32.000
Additionally, his Reddit response didn't really answer the comparisons being drawn to other creators

21:32.000 --> 21:35.000
who had seemingly been more proactive in preventing toxic behaviour.

21:35.000 --> 21:39.000
At the least, if he had made a more official statement, it would have been a benchmark for his stance,

21:39.000 --> 21:42.000
and he could have disowned any abuse towards those in his circle.

21:42.000 --> 21:47.000
It's clear that people weren't listening enough, because it wasn't even just public figures facing down the brunt of the toxicity.

21:47.000 --> 21:50.000
Barely a week after the Tetner debacle, Dream sent a sassy reply to someone,

21:50.000 --> 21:53.000
and then another person believed to be a Stan claimed to have their docs.

21:53.000 --> 22:00.000
Although Dream later clarified he was joking, and so did the mystery Stan, it was once again a little too late.

22:00.000 --> 22:05.000
It should have been presumed that Dream was against the behaviour that some Stans had enacted, even against himself,

22:05.000 --> 22:11.000
and yet the question continued to loom and mutate, only furthering the tension between critics and fans.

22:11.000 --> 22:15.000
But why? Well, I'll do my best to explain.

22:17.000 --> 22:21.000
I have to say, I've been left in a bit of a conflicted state by this point.

22:21.000 --> 22:25.000
There was definitely a lot of questionable behaviour being carried out, but I wasn't sure who the perpetrators were.

22:25.000 --> 22:28.000
It's very easy to immediately point your fingers at these Stans,

22:28.000 --> 22:31.000
but a large majority of tweets on the matter were people condemning these actions,

22:31.000 --> 22:36.000
and even the toxicity in YouTube comment sections could not necessarily be tied back to people directly within these communities.

22:36.000 --> 22:40.000
Just because someone was a fan of Dream didn't mean they were a part of the Twitter Stan community,

22:40.000 --> 22:43.000
however, that comparison was continuously drawn.

22:43.000 --> 22:47.000
For example, another creator by the name of Bolfie posted a screenshot of his comment section,

22:47.000 --> 22:50.000
and many people who asserted that he was practically discount Dream,

22:50.000 --> 22:56.000
assuming because of the crudely drawn smiley face, which as we all know, represents Dream and nothing else.

22:56.000 --> 23:00.000
Once again, these comments were really dumb, but were they all made by Stans,

23:00.000 --> 23:03.000
or just pickle viewers who may also watch Dream?

23:03.000 --> 23:07.000
It's hard to say, and although you can't easily tie YouTube accounts to their respective Twitter handles,

23:07.000 --> 23:11.000
that assumption that all these people making ill-educated comments are immediately Stans

23:11.000 --> 23:17.000
when they possess an equally elementary understanding of the creator in question seems to disregard the system of due protest.

23:17.000 --> 23:21.000
However, I guess when there are issues as inconsequential as the ones discussed so far,

23:21.000 --> 23:24.000
it's very easy to judge situations somewhat haphazardly.

23:24.000 --> 23:28.000
Nonetheless, the problem is that a lot of small instances can often snowball,

23:28.000 --> 23:31.000
particularly when people receive impressions of a fanbase from those instances,

23:31.000 --> 23:35.000
and it wasn't long until the caricature of the zealous Dream Stan began to spread.

23:35.000 --> 23:40.000
I think this was because many people drew parallels between comments that seemed obsessed with associating everything with Dream

23:40.000 --> 23:45.000
to those obsessed with Dream, the Stans, but at this point I'd say it was more hypothetical than proven.

23:45.000 --> 23:51.000
This had two outcomes though, firstly it made people in neighbouring and adjacent communities more hostile to Dream and his Stans,

23:51.000 --> 23:54.000
and it made the Dream Stans themselves more defensive,

23:54.000 --> 23:57.000
and although Dream had proudly proclaimed that he dissuaded toxicity,

23:57.000 --> 24:01.000
he would regularly jump at the opportunity to come to the aid of his Stans.

24:01.000 --> 24:05.000
This statement from September, barely a month after the Techno situation,

24:05.000 --> 24:11.000
asserted that 90% of the time, the people who complained just hated him, or were blowing a non-existent problem out of proportion,

24:11.000 --> 24:15.000
and given what we discussed, it's understandable why people were being a bit more defensive,

24:15.000 --> 24:22.000
at the same time, the problem was, this focus on beating this narrative often then ignores the fact that there may be an actual problem,

24:22.000 --> 24:26.000
and it was gradually emerging. In fact, a few days after this tweet, another creator,

24:26.000 --> 24:30.000
Wilbur Soot, who had replied to Dream's statement after being called out from the replies,

24:30.000 --> 24:34.000
would stop streaming prematurely due to purported toxicity in his chat.

24:34.000 --> 24:38.000
I wanna say, I wanna say chat, you're saying that I wouldn't have died if I picked yellow,

24:38.000 --> 24:41.000
I just wanted to be yellow, why can't Tubbo let me-

24:41.000 --> 24:44.000
I explained that to him and he kept shouting at me, so I just stood my ground.

24:44.000 --> 24:45.000
Nothing.

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
It's not his fucking colour!

24:47.000 --> 24:50.000
I'll give him the colour if he wants next time, but Jesus.

24:50.000 --> 24:51.000
I want it!

24:51.000 --> 24:54.000
It feels like we're just- it doesn't feel like a proper game-

24:54.000 --> 24:58.000
I don't know, I like to, I like to mess around with Among Us,

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
I mean you saw at the beginning of the game I kicked Fundy for fun,

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
but like this feels too much.

25:02.000 --> 25:05.000
What is this chat? What are you doing right now, man?

25:05.000 --> 25:08.000
This is- no, it's not hi, YouTube, chat.

25:08.000 --> 25:12.000
He's a child, you've gotta give him the colour, give him the yellow.

25:12.000 --> 25:13.000
It's fine.

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
I'm just gonna end.

25:15.000 --> 25:19.000
In this case, this was as edgy because Wilbur wouldn't give Tubbo another creator,

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
his colour in Among Us.

25:21.000 --> 25:24.000
I can't say whether this was the case or not, but as long as people perceived it that way,

25:24.000 --> 25:28.000
then friction between communities and creators would continue to rise.

25:28.000 --> 25:33.000
And yes, you can't ignore the fact that 90% allows for 10% of legitimate complaints,

25:33.000 --> 25:37.000
it's not an absolute statement, at the same time, it's still a narrative against the critics

25:37.000 --> 25:40.000
as long as he doesn't give credence to that 10%,

25:40.000 --> 25:43.000
which you can barely squeeze beyond a brief acknowledgement in the reply.

25:43.000 --> 25:49.000
However, 10% of a large number is still a large number, or a significant one at least.

25:49.000 --> 25:53.000
For example, Wilbur, he had no reason to hate Stans, and he clearly doesn't,

25:53.000 --> 25:58.000
he merely had some negative experiences, but some used this statement to challenge him as well.

25:58.000 --> 26:02.000
It seemed to deepen this rift between those who resented Dream and those who supported him,

26:02.000 --> 26:05.000
because the former once again felt that he was dismissing the concerns,

26:05.000 --> 26:09.000
and those who supported him felt validated in their sentiments of unjust persecution.

26:09.000 --> 26:12.000
The term antis also began garnering popularity around this time,

26:12.000 --> 26:17.000
which was basically the slang way to describe people who criticised Dream and the community around him.

26:17.000 --> 26:21.000
I've never been particularly fond of such terms because they often serve as a way to dismiss large groups of people,

26:21.000 --> 26:24.000
even if some of them have valid observations to make.

26:24.000 --> 26:29.000
Eve Dodgen felt like it was becoming an us vs them situation, with Dream stoking the fire,

26:29.000 --> 26:34.000
and many would argue that it didn't stop there, with Dream exposing many to the wrath of his own audience.

26:34.000 --> 26:37.000
Why would he do this though, when it wasn't even his intent in the first place?

26:37.000 --> 26:41.000
Well, normally people's behaviour can be viewed through quite a simple lens,

26:41.000 --> 26:45.000
that being that one is typically responsible for their own actions, and not someone else's.

26:45.000 --> 26:49.000
However, being a public figure is quite different, because many assume you are responsible,

26:49.000 --> 26:52.000
at least in part, for not riling up your audience unnecessarily.

26:52.000 --> 26:56.000
Hell, there are even laws in many countries regarding how you speak to the public,

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
because we are aware when inflammatory language is espoused,

26:58.000 --> 27:03.000
it has the capability to instigate unprovoked harm against innocent parties.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
This is a rule common to creators as well,

27:05.000 --> 27:08.000
you have an audience that is responsive to what you say on a public platform,

27:08.000 --> 27:11.000
and when being responsible for how some of those around you may act,

27:11.000 --> 27:14.000
you are expected to exercise a degree of self-restraint,

27:14.000 --> 27:17.000
and as said, Dream did, but many would ask if it was enough.

27:17.000 --> 27:20.000
One of the greater issues with Stands is that they are loyal to a fault,

27:20.000 --> 27:25.000
and if many of them see their idol under duress, their instinct is to jump to that creator's defence.

27:25.000 --> 27:29.000
On the other hand, if they see a creator calling someone out, they will echo that sentiment,

27:29.000 --> 27:30.000
maybe even more assertively.

27:30.000 --> 27:36.000
This often isn't a problem, most creators end up in quarrels which then involve followers who are keen to voice their opinion.

27:36.000 --> 27:40.000
It's inevitable with the internet, and provided you're not intentionally misrepresenting the other party,

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
it will have a limited impact long term.

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
People are impulsive, people are emotional,

27:44.000 --> 27:49.000
they should be allowed to express themselves online whether they have 20 million subscribers or not.

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
But the question is, to what degree?

27:51.000 --> 27:54.000
Well, let's assess the impact first.

27:59.000 --> 28:03.000
Dream did have his tendencies to be a bit more outspoken than the average Minecraft creator.

28:03.000 --> 28:09.000
The strange paradox is that some of the most vocal people in their content are often some of the most careful on social media.

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
Dream was certainly cautious on what he said,

28:11.000 --> 28:15.000
partly because of the fact that he had been called out for previously ill-advised opinions,

28:15.000 --> 28:19.000
but he was also quite forthright when he felt strongly about his situation,

28:19.000 --> 28:22.000
and as you'll see, strong feelings are risky business.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
Let's move into September and October then,

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
and in and out of interacting with his viewers,

28:26.000 --> 28:30.000
our dear Dream decided to hold a giveaway for a Minecraft gift code with his friend,

28:30.000 --> 28:33.000
and co-founder of Dream SMP, GeorgeNotFound.

28:33.000 --> 28:36.000
George tweeted this code out, excluding the final character.

28:36.000 --> 28:40.000
Viewers were then left scrambling to decide which letter or number occupied that gap.

28:40.000 --> 28:44.000
However, another creator by the name of Colin Smoke, who was assumed to be on good terms with the Dream team,

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
proclaimed that he had succeeded on the first attempt,

28:46.000 --> 28:49.000
before tweeting shortly after that he was hosting a giveaway of his own.

28:49.000 --> 28:52.000
All you had to do was retweet and follow him.

28:52.000 --> 28:57.000
Dream, however, responded, accusing Colin of ransacking a fan giveaway and using it for clout,

28:57.000 --> 29:01.000
though the XD may imply that he at least sees the amusing side of it,

29:01.000 --> 29:04.000
though I feel it may have been tinged with a dashing of sarcasm.

29:04.000 --> 29:08.000
In a shocking twist though, Colin reveals that he didn't actually acquire the code first time,

29:08.000 --> 29:11.000
and this was all in fact a genius ruse by our mastermind jokester.

29:11.000 --> 29:15.000
Additionally, Colin would be holding a legitimate giveaway of his own,

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
so it should be considered a net positive.

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
Unfortunately, Dream didn't see the funny side of this,

29:19.000 --> 29:25.000
expressing his discomfort towards a tweet engineered for exposure on the basis of a giveaway where that element wasn't present.

29:25.000 --> 29:29.000
Colin then responds with the extremely eloquent, no you argument,

29:29.000 --> 29:33.000
and strikes a nerve with our Minecraft virtuoso, who proceeds to scold his former associate,

29:33.000 --> 29:36.000
telling him that he has been disrespectful in public and private,

29:36.000 --> 29:39.000
an abundance of times, and will be subsequently blocked.

29:39.000 --> 29:44.000
On top of this, he suggests that Colin uses his charity work as a vehicle to orchestrate sympathy from those around him,

29:44.000 --> 29:47.000
prompting questions about the creator's character.

29:47.000 --> 29:52.000
I'll add that this wasn't really aided by the fact that one of Dream's colleagues, Sapnap, had blocked Colin a few days prior.

29:52.000 --> 29:55.000
This elicited a variety of reactions from audience members,

29:55.000 --> 29:59.000
as well as Colin, who thought that up to a point that their exchange had been in jest,

29:59.000 --> 30:03.000
I must say I personally find that surprising, especially with Dream's follow-up reply,

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
which I struggle to find the humour in.

30:05.000 --> 30:09.000
As Dream's rather confrontational nature was certainly met with different reactions from those within fandoms,

30:09.000 --> 30:13.000
Colin was one of the first to say that he had been subjected to the wrath of Dream Twitter.

30:13.000 --> 30:16.000
Some were sceptical towards this though, and believed he was playing victim.

30:16.000 --> 30:19.000
Now there was no public sign of mass hate towards Colin.

30:19.000 --> 30:25.000
At the same time, it's often hard given how certain more toxic factions of these communities operate, often incognito.

30:25.000 --> 30:30.000
We all know how some have responded to even trivial disagreements within the Minecraft community.

30:30.000 --> 30:36.000
With Dream aggressively calling someone out, it's hard to rule out the possibility that Colin was exposed to some real nastiness,

30:36.000 --> 30:39.000
though he did seem to walk back on these words a couple months later,

30:39.000 --> 30:42.000
so it's hard to know exactly how he felt about the situation.

30:42.000 --> 30:47.000
Nonetheless, the large majority of Twitter stans seem to be of the belief that this would have been better sold than DMs,

30:47.000 --> 30:53.000
in part because it would have prevented hostility, but also because it would have prevented a very limited and aggressive perspective

30:53.000 --> 30:59.000
being presented to audience members who really didn't have enough context to understand why Dream felt the way he did.

30:59.000 --> 31:05.000
Strictly speaking, this was a matter for Dream and Colin to resolve amongst themselves, even if it did conclude in Dream blocking Colin.

31:05.000 --> 31:09.000
I didn't really find Dream's arguments particularly compelling without further context either.

31:09.000 --> 31:16.000
Colin had already established that he was holding various charity events that month, so it was hard to see it as a spontaneous attempt to defend himself.

31:16.000 --> 31:21.000
Dream just seemed rather irate in the moment, and that's okay, people are angry sometimes.

31:21.000 --> 31:25.000
The problem is, when you have a fanbase capable of self-acknowledged toxicity,

31:25.000 --> 31:32.000
how many times can you direct your anger towards a person or a group of people without also motivating the possibility of harassment and hate,

31:32.000 --> 31:37.000
even if you discourage it yourself? What level of responsibility does your innate humanity hold?

31:37.000 --> 31:42.000
To what point should you police yourself? How should you use that influence when you have fans that devoted?

31:42.000 --> 31:50.000
This question would be posed again barely a day after, at an event known as Minecon Live, an annual convention which, unsurprisingly, concerns Minecraft.

31:50.000 --> 31:54.000
However, due to the then present health concerns, it was being held as an interactive event.

31:54.000 --> 32:01.000
There are a variety of in-game related activities at these ceremonies, and one of the great interests to a lot of the fans this year was the announcement of a new mob.

32:01.000 --> 32:07.000
However, with three options available, it was decided that a poll would be conducted to see what the populace desired.

32:07.000 --> 32:12.000
Given that it was all online, they decided that the best platform for this poll was Twitter, which also made sense.

32:12.000 --> 32:16.000
The three options presented were Glowswood, Iceologer, and Moonloom.

32:16.000 --> 32:23.000
Now, everyone had their preference, I probably would have gone Iceologer myself, my friend suggested it should have been called Chillager,

32:23.000 --> 32:28.000
but Dream had his heart set on the Glow Squid, he even decided to vocally advocate for the voting of the Glow Squid.

32:28.000 --> 32:33.000
Now once again, on its own, this isn't a huge issue, people back horses during races,

32:33.000 --> 32:38.000
but Dream had an extremely large fanbase, some of whom would just go for what he said for the sake of it.

32:38.000 --> 32:44.000
Furthermore, Dream then said he would begin following people who showed him evidence that they voted for the Glow Squid as well,

32:44.000 --> 32:47.000
essentially bribing his audience to vote for his choice.

32:47.000 --> 32:53.000
Lo and behold, many of his audience did, with the Glow Squid winning both the first round and the subsequent runoff.

32:53.000 --> 32:57.000
However, the margin by which this creature won its votes was, to be frank, marginal,

32:57.000 --> 33:04.000
and this led many to conclude that Iceologer would have won had it not been for Dream's rather enthusiastic endorsement of its adversary.

33:04.000 --> 33:08.000
This annoyed a decent amount of people at the time who accused Dream of rigging the vote in its favour,

33:08.000 --> 33:14.000
it was hard to deny it really with the evidence available, but he's a person, he can state whatever preferences he has,

33:14.000 --> 33:20.000
and encourage people by whatever means, it happens every year in elections, he clearly thought of it that way as well,

33:20.000 --> 33:24.000
and initially just mean the fact that he had affected the outcome of the Minecraft poll,

33:24.000 --> 33:30.000
but other people weren't thrilled, and it's not hard to see why either, why even vote if your vote doesn't matter.

33:30.000 --> 33:34.000
A couple days later, Dream released a more comprehensive thread, explaining his motives,

33:34.000 --> 33:40.000
but also denying this idea that he'd induced excessive influence on the outcome of a vote, which was certainly debatable.

33:40.000 --> 33:44.000
Further to this though, he stated that in fact he didn't really care which mob was added,

33:44.000 --> 33:48.000
and certainly not about a dumb squid, which I'm not sure was the best response,

33:48.000 --> 33:52.000
it was concluded with the caveat that he actually did think it was the best choice,

33:52.000 --> 33:58.000
but once again, Dream sent mixed signals which clearly didn't satisfy those who had felt he had more responsibility to own up to,

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
and they were going to make this known.

34:00.000 --> 34:12.000
Here's the problem, and it shouldn't be too difficult to explain,

34:12.000 --> 34:17.000
if one person can influence the outcome of a poll, then it can no longer really be considered a poll.

34:17.000 --> 34:22.000
People are more than welcome to express their opinions and preferences, but we should still encourage people to vote for what they want,

34:22.000 --> 34:27.000
and Dream's involvement changed the outcome on the basis of his involvement alone, and very little else.

34:27.000 --> 34:32.000
And it's hard to go Mr Minecraft over here too much for this, because everyone was offering their input and influence as well,

34:32.000 --> 34:37.000
but I think it just reached a stage of disproportionality where basically anything went if Dream said so,

34:37.000 --> 34:41.000
you still want that illusion of democracy at least, and Dream couldn't meme his way out of this one.

34:41.000 --> 34:46.000
It was worse when he claimed that he didn't even care, because regardless of how irrelevant the vote was to him or his followers,

34:46.000 --> 34:51.000
it was clearly meaningful to a lot of users, and some felt a bit robbed of their freedom of choice.

34:51.000 --> 34:56.000
People still want their voice to be heard, even if it is on the vote of a mostly inconsequential in-game addition to Minecraft,

34:56.000 --> 35:02.000
it's also hard to buy Dream's whole response that he didn't actually care, he made arguments against the Isolager,

35:02.000 --> 35:08.000
and in favour of the Glow Squid, not really the ones a person who doesn't care would make, he clearly had a preference.

35:08.000 --> 35:15.000
I think one of the greatest issues with influencers and their use of stands is that it will often bypass the process of critical thinking.

35:15.000 --> 35:22.000
Now, young people online aren't going to be highest tier intellectuals, at the same time, you still want to encourage someone to think for themselves,

35:22.000 --> 35:31.000
rather than necessarily just adopting another person's opinion because they tell them to, particularly if they then implement that opinion in a way that can affect real world outcomes.

35:31.000 --> 35:38.000
Now, as said, this ideal isn't really possible a lot of the time, YouTubers expressing the most trivial opinions will affect their audiences,

35:38.000 --> 35:44.000
but it's important to make sure you don't necessarily exploit that concept, and in many critics eyes, Dream crossed a line.

35:44.000 --> 35:48.000
Following this situation, Dream went through a process of seemingly coming to terms with his influence,

35:48.000 --> 35:53.000
a week after the aforementioned threads, released an even more comprehensive Twitlonger which addressed a variety of controversies,

35:53.000 --> 36:00.000
a fair few of which we'll return to later, but also discussing the use of its influence on that specific vote, and taking a more sober reflection on his actions.

36:00.000 --> 36:05.000
He states that it was merely a social experiment slash meme to see if he could pick a team and it could win,

36:05.000 --> 36:09.000
but it did go too far and he acknowledges and apologises for that.

36:09.000 --> 36:14.000
I don't think this is an unreasonable response, I can see why it bothers some after his first attempt to address it,

36:14.000 --> 36:20.000
but one aspect that is a central theme in this specific Twitlonger was his failure to consider the feelings of others previously,

36:20.000 --> 36:24.000
and he clearly wanted to be more sensitive towards others moving forward.

36:24.000 --> 36:28.000
I can respect that, and a lot of his friends and viewers alike respected it as well,

36:28.000 --> 36:35.000
observing that anyone who spends this much effort addressing their past controversies and transgressions with that degree of introspection and detail,

36:35.000 --> 36:39.000
must be demonstrating their ability to change as a person, I would agree on principle.

36:39.000 --> 36:45.000
However, only time would tell if he had truly changed, it's one thing to commit to it, it's another to enact it.

36:45.000 --> 36:49.000
Dream was an individual, and he had a right to his own opinions, thoughts and feelings,

36:49.000 --> 36:56.000
however he also had a responsibility to not weaponise this faction of his audience who may derive a lot of their behaviour from his own.

36:56.000 --> 36:59.000
It's a fine balance, and if Dream really wanted his full autonomy back,

36:59.000 --> 37:04.000
he would definitely have to distance himself from the elements of Stan culture that may also be beneficial to him,

37:04.000 --> 37:07.000
that fervent, albeit occasionally flawed loyalty.

37:07.000 --> 37:26.000
It's what brought him a robust community, it's what bolstered views, sales and much more.

37:26.000 --> 37:29.000
People are fast to criticise Stan's as being proponents of cancel culture,

37:29.000 --> 37:33.000
but many also defended Dream when they believed his remorse was genuine,

37:33.000 --> 37:38.000
he gave him an extra line of protection against many of those haters who viewed his actions less charitably,

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
those who wanted to see him fail.

37:40.000 --> 37:45.000
In the Twitlong he expresses how much he adores his Stans, in spite of rumours that he actually despises them,

37:45.000 --> 37:50.000
he references the numerous times he stood up for them as a creator and pledges his own loyalty in return to them,

37:50.000 --> 37:53.000
he clearly values their presence a lot, and regardless of the reasoning,

37:53.000 --> 37:58.000
one of the priorities here was to convince those who may be sceptical where his allegiances lie.

37:58.000 --> 38:02.000
However, given that many would argue that these Stans have also precipitated certain incidents

38:02.000 --> 38:06.000
where people have ended up being negatively affected, most recently in the Minecraft poll,

38:06.000 --> 38:10.000
some may also feel he has neglected to address the downsides of his own community,

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
with a desire to retain their support,

38:12.000 --> 38:16.000
and although in the months following Dream certainly moderated his demeanour more mindfully,

38:16.000 --> 38:20.000
for a bit at least, there were still some people who felt that his more devoted viewers acted out of line,

38:20.000 --> 38:24.000
and many critics felt Dream wasn't really proactive enough in countering it.

38:24.000 --> 38:29.000
Every now and then he'd put out a tweet reminding people that toxicity wasn't really representative of those who supported him,

38:29.000 --> 38:34.000
which is all well and good, but it was always done under the preface that he was defending Stans from being generalised,

38:34.000 --> 38:38.000
which undermined any notion of recognition of the other point being made.

38:38.000 --> 38:42.000
On the other end of the spectrum, when Stans did act out of line,

38:42.000 --> 38:45.000
you'd regularly have people generalise them to represent the community as a whole,

38:45.000 --> 38:48.000
which entrenched this divide between the two sides of the discussion.

38:48.000 --> 38:52.000
On top of this, you had people who just did not forgive Dream for the use of his influence

38:52.000 --> 38:56.000
and continued to maintain a narrative against him, provoking the ire of his viewer base.

38:56.000 --> 39:02.000
However, every now and then you'd have someone who would recognise that the situation was more nuanced than either side presented it as.

39:03.000 --> 39:09.000
It's honestly beyond me how people are able to hate on a Minecraft video, like it's very very strange,

39:09.000 --> 39:14.000
and I'm just going to say it for people who are concerned, I'm alright with these messages,

39:14.000 --> 39:19.000
okay, I'm alright after having received them, I'm not feeling down or anything.

39:19.000 --> 39:23.000
If anything, I'm just a bit angry, not because I've received them,

39:23.000 --> 39:29.000
but because people have this capacity to hate that much over such little things,

39:29.000 --> 39:33.000
that what if other content creators are also getting the same thing,

39:33.000 --> 39:38.000
and what if other content creators are out there who are maybe not as emotionally resilient,

39:38.000 --> 39:41.000
or maybe a little bit more susceptible to these comments.

39:41.000 --> 39:44.000
This is a clip from a creator known as Fizzybanger,

39:44.000 --> 39:48.000
now he makes a variety of claims relating to his experiences with the Dream community,

39:48.000 --> 39:52.000
some of which are rather strong, and as he doesn't show any accompanying evidence,

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
I'm not really in a position to comment on their verity.

39:54.000 --> 39:59.000
With that said, his experience echoes many others and there's already strong evidence to support those.

39:59.000 --> 40:04.000
His arguments are reasonable and fair, trying to work out how to expel the toxicity from the community.

40:04.000 --> 40:07.000
You can't get rid of hate completely, that's just a part of society really,

40:07.000 --> 40:13.000
you can't get rid of hatred, it's always going to be there, it's a malignant sort of thing,

40:13.000 --> 40:18.000
but Dream could at least use his influence to try and maybe quell a lot of the toxicity

40:18.000 --> 40:22.000
that people try to pass on through his name.

40:22.000 --> 40:28.000
So that's what I'm saying, no hate on Dream, but I definitely think, not just him as well,

40:28.000 --> 40:31.000
but a lot of people should start addressing this more the way that I have,

40:31.000 --> 40:34.000
because I haven't seen anyone talk about this.

40:34.000 --> 40:39.000
However, in the comment section you would see that the debate would regularly divert to which Dream Stands are the toxic ones,

40:39.000 --> 40:42.000
how we'd characterise them, who is right and who is wrong,

40:42.000 --> 40:45.000
and an underlying direct problem that leads into my next part.

40:45.000 --> 40:49.000
I'm sure many Dream Stands want to see positive change between communities,

40:49.000 --> 40:53.000
and wanted those in their own communities to be the best representatives of them as a whole,

40:53.000 --> 40:59.000
but they didn't want to also be tied to the toxicity that they didn't see themselves as responsible for.

40:59.000 --> 41:04.000
Equally, many in the Minecraft communities wanted to create content without being associated with Dream,

41:04.000 --> 41:10.000
someone who has openly said that he's not that invested in the many aspects of Minecraft that other creators are.

41:10.000 --> 41:13.000
However, this discussion often ended as soon as it began,

41:13.000 --> 41:18.000
because no one was prepared to agree on what the guilty party was, or who they represented,

41:18.000 --> 41:22.000
whether those Stands represented Dream or not, there was clearly some correlation,

41:22.000 --> 41:26.000
and tensions were definitely palpable, there needed to be some sense spoken.

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
But who was going to speak it?

41:28.000 --> 41:36.000
Stalker fans must be stopped, is something that's been said a lot on YouTube and Twitter over the last year or so,

41:36.000 --> 41:40.000
involving a specific type of fan known as a Stan.

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
Dream himself, of course.

41:48.000 --> 41:58.000
Dream's embrace of the Stan mentality was not for everyone,

41:58.000 --> 42:03.000
mainly because some people just disagreed with the degree of parasocial relationships that he seemed to enjoy.

42:03.000 --> 42:10.000
The Internet's intimacy certainly intensified certain aspects that other creators in Dream's radius struggled to alienate themselves from.

42:10.000 --> 42:13.000
Unfortunately, that's another downside to being an extremely influential creator,

42:13.000 --> 42:17.000
you don't just have an impact on your own fans, but on other creators in the genre.

42:17.000 --> 42:23.000
So with that in mind, allow me to introduce you to someone known as Josh, or Josh if you're proper English.

42:23.000 --> 42:39.000
Josh is a YouTuber and Twitch streamer, he plays a variety of games, most importantly Minecraft,

42:39.000 --> 42:45.000
in which he was best known for his antics on SMP Live and SMP Up, servers operated by his then friends.

42:45.000 --> 42:52.000
However, he also had areas of expertise outside the 3D sandbox, and didn't really pertain a specific loyalty to those communities or those within them.

42:52.000 --> 42:59.000
He'd already expressed his distaste towards Stans earlier in the year, within a tweet requesting people cease sending his friends threatening messages.

42:59.000 --> 43:05.000
Here he also suggests that viewers drop the Stan label if they want to distance themselves from those who have acted out of line.

43:05.000 --> 43:10.000
It's clear that he was not enamoured by the more zealous of those within his audience, this was a warning shot.

43:11.000 --> 43:15.000
Since then however, he had remained mostly quiet on the matter, until December at least.

43:15.000 --> 43:23.000
At this point, Dream Stans were garnering notoriety for a few reasons, and they were becoming increasingly difficult to ignore due to their presence on trending pages,

43:23.000 --> 43:28.000
with interesting hashtags to say the least, ones which I really cannot be bothered to read out.

43:28.000 --> 43:34.000
Josh, clearly agitated by all this and other matters as well, decided to fully sever any relationship with the Stan community,

43:34.000 --> 43:42.000
announcing on his alt account that anybody who considers themselves Stans, or part of any Twit or TWT, can unfollow him as he believes the culture to be toxic.

43:42.000 --> 43:50.000
He further elaborated on this in another thread, labelling Dream Stans mentally unwell and framing them as a hive mind whose behaviour has become progressively worse,

43:50.000 --> 43:54.000
which is quite the supposition given his own prior experiences with these groups of people.

43:54.000 --> 43:58.000
If this whole situation was indeed worsening, how could someone like Josh ignore it?

43:58.000 --> 44:04.000
These statements were initially met with support from his audience, however then our darling Dream, who had been mentioned in another of Josh's tweets,

44:04.000 --> 44:08.000
decided to weigh in with his thoughts on the matter, with the graceful retort of,

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
you're an idiot, to his fellow Minecrafter.

44:10.000 --> 44:18.000
George then vigilantly pointed out the poise of his associates response, and Dream informs him that his nuclear take unfortunately doesn't merit a proper response.

44:18.000 --> 44:24.000
Of course, this then causes loads of viewers of both creators to pile on with their takes, before Dream returns to his main Twitter,

44:24.000 --> 44:30.000
to once more defend the honour of his loyal disciples, tweeting out the new and improved Dream dictionary definition of Stans,

44:30.000 --> 44:38.000
which equates to those who come together in a community while expressing that interest through love, support, sugar and spice and all things nice,

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
doesn't it just warm your heart?

44:40.000 --> 44:46.000
Well, not really, but I can understand why he made it. Although it's rather heavy handed, it's clear he's trying to make a point here.

44:46.000 --> 44:52.000
Go back a year, and Stans have always been characterised as the overly obsessive fan, hence why to support Manto of Stalker fan.

44:52.000 --> 44:58.000
In last year though, I think many of these communities, and obviously Dream himself, have come to see the word Stan through a different lens,

44:58.000 --> 45:02.000
one that doesn't necessarily represent the formerly perceived stereotype.

45:02.000 --> 45:09.000
These large communities come in together to lend a mostly unconditional slate of support to a creator, with the caveat that they're not too problematic of course.

45:09.000 --> 45:14.000
Alternatively, Stan has also become a buzzword for when a follower of Dream acts out of line,

45:14.000 --> 45:19.000
and Dream laying down his gauntlet for how he defines a Stan is meant to challenge those who see them in a much different light.

45:19.000 --> 45:25.000
This doesn't wholly address Josh's point though, after all he wasn't just attacking the conduct of fringe groups,

45:25.000 --> 45:32.000
he was addressing the entire mentality supposedly behind Stan culture, and the allegedly cult-like worship of online figures.

45:32.000 --> 45:37.000
Dream however had his own response for this as well, now some could class it as a rather uninspired no you argument,

45:37.000 --> 45:42.000
after all, I really don't think a majority of people who have made this point are Tom Brady fans themselves,

45:42.000 --> 45:47.000
I'm sure Tom Brady fans would have better things to do than provide insight on the internet's freshest YouTube drama.

45:47.000 --> 45:54.000
However, I would say that he's trying to make the point that being fanatically enthusiastic for a certain creator isn't out of the ordinary at all for our culture,

45:54.000 --> 46:00.000
and that we do it in plenty of other fields as well. Why should Stanning Dream be considered any different?

46:17.000 --> 46:20.000
I loved talking to other people about my favourite team.

46:20.000 --> 46:25.000
The position was elaborated on a few days later, in another video by Dream, appropriately called Stan's,

46:25.000 --> 46:30.000
where he once again reasserts the argument that his stands are misunderstood, and unfairly portrayed by critics,

46:30.000 --> 46:37.000
it doesn't really say anything different to what we know already, but does go into more detail in a way that relates the behaviour back to the human condition.

46:37.000 --> 46:42.000
Now of course, that didn't make me obsessive, it made me human, and when you like something a lot,

46:42.000 --> 46:47.000
you like to spend more time involving that thing that you like. You talk about it, you tell other people about it,

46:47.000 --> 46:52.000
and you try to spend as much time involving it as you can, because you enjoy it, and it makes you happy.

46:52.000 --> 46:57.000
He also talks about these misunderstandings and situations where people jump to the Dream Stan's toxic point of view,

46:57.000 --> 47:00.000
without critically considering the other possibilities.

47:00.000 --> 47:05.000
Technoblade fans, or just Dream haters, see anyone calling me better than Techno, or just one of the best Minecraft players,

47:05.000 --> 47:10.000
as toxic Stan's, which just isn't true. It may be biased, but it's natural.

47:10.000 --> 47:16.000
Overall, it's a pretty standard video without much noteworthy to it, though one quote did catch my attention.

47:16.000 --> 47:21.000
But there's actually way more haters that take it too far, and usually in a much, much worse way.

47:21.000 --> 47:26.000
I've had people try and find my address, spam my comment section, send me death threats, and so much more,

47:26.000 --> 47:30.000
but not from Stan's, just from people who really, really don't like me.

47:30.000 --> 47:37.000
Dream, mate, your own Stan's are not going to be sending you death threats, the point is that one creator's Stan is another person's hater,

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
and that perspective will differ between creators.

47:40.000 --> 47:44.000
Also, very, very minor side note, Dream, but if you're going to talk about American football,

47:44.000 --> 47:49.000
maybe don't use a photo of British football, or soccer, as you call it.

47:49.000 --> 47:54.000
I don't agree with everything my fans do, obviously, and if they overstep boundaries, I tell them.

47:54.000 --> 47:57.000
I tell them that I didn't like what they did, I tell them it made me uncomfortable.

47:57.000 --> 48:00.000
And you can see that on my Twitter, as recently as a few days ago.

48:00.000 --> 48:06.000
But when I tell them, they stop, because they genuinely care about me, and look up to me, and why would they want to make me upset?

48:06.000 --> 48:12.000
But, the people who don't like me, they don't care, they don't stop, so it makes it much worse,

48:12.000 --> 48:16.000
and that is a huge difference between Dream Hater's and Dream Stan's.

48:16.000 --> 48:21.000
But Dream believed in his Stan's, he had faith in his Stan's, and he proudly stood with his Stan's,

48:21.000 --> 48:26.000
and with people like Josh and other critics trying to resent his Stan's as something he didn't believe them to be,

48:26.000 --> 48:31.000
he had good reason in his mind to, but was he tying himself to something that was beyond his control?

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
Well, let's talk about it.

48:36.000 --> 48:53.000
Thank you guys for all the support, and don't let anyone convince you that something you genuinely enjoy is weird,

48:53.000 --> 48:57.000
because they are weird for caring so much about what you enjoy.

48:57.000 --> 49:03.000
Dream's response certainly irritated a few to say the least, and not necessarily because people disagreed with him, although many did.

49:03.000 --> 49:07.000
I think the main reason was this sentiment that Dream didn't really mean what he was saying,

49:07.000 --> 49:10.000
and as a matter of fact was merely saying it to appease his cash cow.

49:10.000 --> 49:14.000
Many thought this was illustrated by the fact that Dream's opinions had taken a pretty sharp U-turn.

49:14.000 --> 49:19.000
First of all, on Stan's themselves, a tweet from the year before showed him criticising Stan's fairly harshly

49:19.000 --> 49:22.000
for not respecting his own boundaries, despite demanding their own.

49:22.000 --> 49:27.000
Some argue that this makes him more reasonable in fact, showing him as not being afraid to criticise his own audience,

49:27.000 --> 49:31.000
but many saw it more as a dismissal of his nature to previously criticise,

49:31.000 --> 49:34.000
and moreover, a betrayal of the greater Minecraft community that had nurtured him.

49:34.000 --> 49:37.000
Would he be the one to speak up if the same situation happened today?

49:37.000 --> 49:43.000
The man who said that after affecting an in-game update that he didn't even really care for the game that he was renowned for?

49:43.000 --> 49:47.000
The problem is that although Dream was a Minecraft creator, by all intents and purposes,

49:47.000 --> 49:50.000
he was no longer affiliated with the Minecraft community in the way that he used to be.

49:50.000 --> 49:56.000
Many in fact viewed him as antithetical to what they believed in, and it went deeper than that, to a personal level.

49:56.000 --> 50:00.000
Dream's evolution as an individual can definitely be highlighted by his older content,

50:00.000 --> 50:06.000
which saw him taking more traditionally gamer positions on matters such as language, cultural appropriation, and the rest.

50:06.000 --> 50:10.000
In fact, one rather interesting document posited the claim that Dream was not merely an edgy gamer,

50:10.000 --> 50:15.000
but a Red Dead Republican, who was an outspoken Trump supporter in Reddit forums, on a formally shared account.

50:15.000 --> 50:21.000
Now, the content itself isn't overly offensive, this account clearly errs on the side of apologism as opposed to bigotry.

50:21.000 --> 50:26.000
At the same time, many would argue that Trump and the policies that he's imposed are so inherently bigoted,

50:26.000 --> 50:31.000
there really can't be room for those who make excuses for him, a position very common amongst socially conscious stans.

50:31.000 --> 50:35.000
In a subsequent Page Spin response, he stressed that he had never ever supported Trump,

50:35.000 --> 50:41.000
and although unsure of which posts were made by him, if any, he wanted to dis about anything that he said in the past that was him,

50:41.000 --> 50:45.000
that these were more a result of upbringing and ignorance rather than any form of bigotry.

50:45.000 --> 50:49.000
It's a fair response, but some were not convinced.

50:49.000 --> 50:56.000
Online in particular, certain creators of recent have ended up being criticised for essentially selling out to what some brand is the woke mob.

50:56.000 --> 51:02.000
When online and a small creator, many like to be outspoken edgelords against the grain,

51:02.000 --> 51:08.000
and as soon as they obtain any sort of socially conscious following, they're keen to please behaviour they were previously known to indulge in.

51:08.000 --> 51:15.000
Dream has regularly been invoked in these conversations, given his historical defensive behaviour that many of his stan community would take umbrage with,

51:15.000 --> 51:18.000
with some change apart since the garnering of a proper follower base,

51:18.000 --> 51:22.000
with many asserting that the reason for this about base being that it was profitable for him.

51:22.000 --> 51:26.000
Dream would regularly be called out by his audience for previous stances he had taken,

51:26.000 --> 51:32.000
with many seeing his responses as grovelling for forgiveness from an audience that he had previously claimed himself was not often permitting.

51:32.000 --> 51:36.000
Now, it's very easy to take up that rather uncompromising position,

51:36.000 --> 51:42.000
particularly given that popularity is often the only variable that has changed in the time between the U-turn in opinions.

51:42.000 --> 51:48.000
However, I do think that it's a reductionist stance because it doesn't necessarily take into account the other personal changes one may undergo

51:48.000 --> 51:52.000
when garnering traction online, and being able to have your own individual platform.

51:52.000 --> 51:59.000
When you're in a toxic community, it can easily affect your behaviour and views that may precipitate actions that don't necessarily represent who you are individually.

51:59.000 --> 52:06.000
That's basic psychology, and you would struggle to name many YouTubers who haven't changed as their influence has expanded, for better and for worse.

52:06.000 --> 52:11.000
In fact, many viewers would argue that Dream has merely been educated, and thus reformed his positions accordingly.

52:11.000 --> 52:17.000
This then disillusioned him with regards to his previous communities, and he actually found more loyalty and acceptance from his supporters,

52:17.000 --> 52:21.000
while many of those criticising him and his beloved audience didn't even care for him.

52:21.000 --> 52:26.000
This was the alternative theory. Dream came from a community that likely had a lot of outgoing edginess,

52:26.000 --> 52:31.000
and once he met more socially conscious audience members, he matured and became more socially conscious himself.

52:31.000 --> 52:34.000
This is the mutual influence that we spoke about earlier.

52:34.000 --> 52:38.000
Dream established a bond with people outside of his comfort zone, and subsequently changed himself.

52:38.000 --> 52:42.000
But how much were his audience willing to change, and how much could he ask of them?

52:42.000 --> 52:46.000
How much of this was just people's own assumptions clouding their perceptions?

52:46.000 --> 52:50.000
On top of this, some may ask why it even matters whether Dream was genuine or not.

52:50.000 --> 52:54.000
If what he was doing was the right thing, why should it be a problem to decide whether he believes in it?

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
Well, I guess it comes down to principle.

52:56.000 --> 53:02.000
If someone is willing to turn their back on previous stances for the pursuit of personal gain, what else are they willing to do?

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
So the word stan doesn't mean stalker fan.

53:05.000 --> 53:11.000
As much as you can google the definition and say it does, my stans are a group of amazing, incredible, creative people

53:11.000 --> 53:14.000
that are some of the most supportive people on the planet.

53:14.000 --> 53:20.000
Although many would justifiably defend his position as one of a reformed individual who wanted to be more sensitive,

53:20.000 --> 53:21.000
others just did not see that.

53:21.000 --> 53:27.000
More, a person deserting their former beliefs to pander to a demographic that was financially lucrative to him,

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
throwing a culture under the bus to pursue something greater.

53:29.000 --> 53:34.000
If that was the case, surely he'd continue to prioritise his preservation over any real moral compass.

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
Well, at this point, it was ambiguous.

53:36.000 --> 53:41.000
You have people on one side, you have people on the other, each of them vociferously defending their standpoints,

53:41.000 --> 53:44.000
with Dream designated as the slightly slanted spectator.

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
But there were a few ironclad facts.

53:46.000 --> 53:51.000
We knew that Dream was aware of his power as a creator, because he had said it in a bit longer.

53:51.000 --> 53:57.000
We knew that he was regretful of utilising his fans in the past to influence outcomes, and had vowed not to do it again.

53:57.000 --> 54:03.000
We knew that he did not believe many of the claims that stand culture was toxic at its core, but did have toxic members,

54:03.000 --> 54:07.000
and how they mobilised would depend, in part, on Dream's own demeanour.

54:07.000 --> 54:11.000
These are all plausible at this point, but if he was going to back his own horse,

54:11.000 --> 54:16.000
he needed to make sure that he didn't end up validating people's criticisms of it with his own actions.

54:16.000 --> 54:20.000
Whether he wanted to acknowledge it or not, Dream did have an army at his disposal,

54:20.000 --> 54:24.000
who would defend him no matter how much the odds were stacked against him.

54:24.000 --> 54:29.000
Little did we, nor they, know how much the loyalty would be tested in the following months.

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
So, let's go for a run.

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
Speedrunning

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
It's a pretty popular activity amongst gaming communities.

54:51.000 --> 54:57.000
For those who aren't aware, it's the act of playing through a game with the intent of completing it in as short a time as possible.

54:57.000 --> 55:01.000
Now, the actual prerequisites for what would be classed as completion can depend on the game itself,

55:01.000 --> 55:07.000
and even in-game conditions, as many have other features that may not be viewed as essential to the plotline's fulfilment.

55:07.000 --> 55:13.000
Some may wonder how you can even speedrun a game like Minecraft, which was launched as an open-world sandbox, without any clear campaign mode.

55:13.000 --> 55:20.000
Well, not too long after the launch, Minecraft's chief architect, Notch, also thought that there should be at least some end goal for the players,

55:20.000 --> 55:27.000
so towards the end of 2011, the Ender Dragon was added, whose defeat would engender the final credits, signifying completion of the game.

55:27.000 --> 55:31.000
However, the Ender Dragon wasn't just waiting for any old Tom, Dick, or Ari to slay them,

55:31.000 --> 55:36.000
they reside in a place called The End, on an island where they launch arrow attacks on the besieged gamer.

55:36.000 --> 55:41.000
The End can only be accessed through a portal created using Eyes of Ender, in a structure known as a stronghold.

55:41.000 --> 55:46.000
However, you also need a sufficient number of Ender Pearls and Blaze Rods, which can only be dropped by certain mobs.

55:46.000 --> 55:52.000
To put it simply, it's not considered a facile task. If you're interested in more, watch Kordwick's video, he summarises it well.

55:52.000 --> 55:57.000
The game's challenging nature naturally makes it the target of competitive players who want to speedrun it,

55:57.000 --> 56:03.000
and there are plenty of leaderboards dedicated to just that. As I mentioned earlier, Dream wasn't just a pretty smiley face,

56:03.000 --> 56:08.000
he was skilled on the gameplay front of Minecraft as well, and did regularly partake in speedruns of his own,

56:08.000 --> 56:15.000
publishing them online and submitting times for various leaderboards for the respective versions of the game, including world records.

56:15.000 --> 56:20.000
He had hung up his running boots for a period of time, but appeared to make a comeback towards the end of 2020,

56:20.000 --> 56:25.000
scoring impressive times on his Twitch streams, and subsequently tendering his results to the official Minecraft speedrunning team.

56:25.000 --> 56:31.000
In around October, a week after the streaming question, he announced he would cease streaming his speedruns due to allegations they were fake,

56:31.000 --> 56:36.000
expressing frustration that people would even question his ability when he has scored world records before.

56:36.000 --> 56:42.000
Completely understandable. However, come the 11th of December, the same day in which he posted his earnest defensive stand culture,

56:42.000 --> 56:48.000
another video was uploaded, this time though by the head moderator of speedrun.com, Geosquare,

56:48.000 --> 56:53.000
alongside a rather lengthy document that seemed to express skepticism at Dream's performance.

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
Let's take a look at Dream's odds.

56:57.000 --> 57:04.000
This isn't exactly a good look. Across six streams, Dream bartered 262 times and got 42 pro trades,

57:04.000 --> 57:08.000
which when plugged into the formula, comes in at 1 in 177 billion.

57:08.000 --> 57:14.000
Guess what else has a random drop chance in speedruns? Blaze rods. Anyone wanna guess what Dream's blaze luck was?

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
1 in 113 billion.

57:16.000 --> 57:21.000
The accompanying document laid out in the most comprehensive terms the sheer unlikeliness of Dream's fortune

57:21.000 --> 57:25.000
in acquiring various items necessary to facilitate one's transportation to the end.

57:25.000 --> 57:31.000
The two items of interest were ender pearls and blaze rods, which have a pretty defined percentage probability of dropping

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
when you slay the mobs who may carry them.

57:33.000 --> 57:38.000
As the graphs illustrated, Dream's accomplishment seemed to exceed the realms of chance,

57:38.000 --> 57:41.000
an implied Dream may have downloaded mods to enhance his performance,

57:41.000 --> 57:45.000
basically the gamer equivalent of anabolic steroids.

57:45.000 --> 57:49.000
As Dream likes to point out, just because the odds of his luck happening are in the trillions,

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
it doesn't mean that's the same chance of him cheating.

57:51.000 --> 57:57.000
I mean, with Illumina's considerably lucky 92% odds, it doesn't mean that there was a 92% chance of him cheating.

57:57.000 --> 58:02.000
But the thing that Dream misses is that the odds for the event and the odds for cheating are still correlated.

58:02.000 --> 58:09.000
If you perform an infinitesimally unlikely event, then you can be extremely confident that something went wrong that allowed it to happen.

58:09.000 --> 58:13.000
Just because something is possible doesn't mean that it's at all feasible.

58:13.000 --> 58:17.000
Here the numbers are just so large that they outweigh any conceivable subjective opinion.

58:17.000 --> 58:23.000
The video also showed that Dream had previously attempted to defend himself when confronted with this information by the moderation team,

58:23.000 --> 58:28.000
presenting a document from its own perspective which attempted to demonstrate the flaws in their own calculations.

58:28.000 --> 58:31.000
However, Geosquare presented a response to this as well.

58:31.000 --> 58:38.000
You can check the paper for a rebuttal, but we effectively examined the probability of this happening even if we checked multiple runners or streams first,

58:38.000 --> 58:43.000
and the bias wasn't nearly strong enough to refute the idea that the odds were possibly tampered with.

58:43.000 --> 58:50.000
Look, we're the first to admit that the data is actually biased, but it's nowhere near as biased as it would have to be to disqualify the evidence.

58:50.000 --> 58:54.000
The thing with real-world data is that it's pretty much always going to be biased in some way,

58:54.000 --> 58:59.000
but the field of statistics was made to interpret this stuff nonetheless and account for all the errors.

58:59.000 --> 59:06.000
In our case, we've overcorrected the bias far enough so that we're biasing in favour of Dream, and we're still getting pretty crazy numbers.

59:06.000 --> 59:14.000
All in all, the report and the video concluded that Dream's chances of succeeding a speedrun with this luck were approximately 1 in 7.5 trillion,

59:14.000 --> 59:19.000
and as many other creators noted, that was being generous. Typically this sort of thing would be a private matter,

59:19.000 --> 59:24.000
but as he was a public figure and had completed these speedruns publicly and continued to defend them privately,

59:24.000 --> 59:28.000
the mods were clean and happy that he had sold these as authentic and continued to dispute this when challenged.

59:28.000 --> 59:34.000
Now, with all this out in the open, and with all the previous pressure on him, how would Dream respond?

59:34.000 --> 59:37.000
Well, he channeled his inner Trump.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:06.000
It seems Dream won, and he won by a lot. He tweeted an additional reply stating that many good mods had spoken to him

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:11.000
and said that they were going to quit the team because they believed the so-called investigation to be a rotten one.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:16.000
A very rotten one indeed. In the replies, Dream was met with support from his fans.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:20.000
After all, how could he be accused of being too lucky in a luck-based game?

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:27.000
This wasn't Dream's only response, he also took to Discord to label Geo Square a clout-chasing clown who needs to go back to the circus.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:33.000
Dream clearly felt strongly about this matter, and to an extent, with the context given, it was understandable.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:38.000
After all, this was his credibility that was under scrutiny with quite damaging implications.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:44.000
It was quite ironic after what had all just been said, what we know Dream knows, and the actual facts of the situation.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:51.000
Geo Square himself demonetised all videos to avoid the allegation of clout chasing, and clearly went to a lot of effort to be meticulous.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:54.000
I would say there are much easier ways to garner attention online.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:01:01.000
To frame a person who merely thought they were doing their job as self-serving and to use incendiary language is obviously going to provoke audiences,

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:07.000
even the most tranquil. Dream really needed to back up its claims before jumping to such conclusions, but he was determined to do so.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:14.000
Following this, a series of threads and tweets were posted in the coming days, all with the intent of exonerating him and his unlikely speedrun.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:19.000
These included explanations, corrections, additional evidence, many of which seemed to substantiate his case.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:28.000
This was topped off finally with his own document, filled to the brim with statistical jargon, and authored by a professional astrophysicist who worked at an online science consulting company.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:32.000
Alongside this, he published an accompanying video to summarise these alternative findings.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:41.000
Probability. Probability is the measurement of how likely something is to happen.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:49.000
Recently, one of my speedruns that I did on Twitch has been analysed by the speedrun.com volunteer mod team and deemed as improbable to a degree that is nearly impossible.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:57.000
So lucky in fact, that they came to the mathematical conclusion that it had 1 in 7.5 trillion odds of happening.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:02.000
So, they put out a video and a long document talking about it, and this is my response.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:12.000
The video and the document agree with the thesis of the original report published by the moderation team that the base probability of Dream's drop rates on the mobs in question are astonishingly low.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:18.000
How they sought to compensate for other statistical biases that the moderation team may have established during their initial investigation

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:23.000
is conducted with intent to plant that seeded doubt in the mind of the viewer, though this does fluctuate.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:31.000
Even with the harshest of odds, it is impossible to say with certainty that Dream cheated, so Dream was completely justified in defending his position if he believed it.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:38.000
With these 11 streams included, the data shows quote, no statistically significant evidence that Dream was modifying the probabilities.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:57.000
As a final closing note, if despite all the evidence that I've presented you still believe that the odds are too low, I want to mention a couple things from the report.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:00.000
One, the expert that wrote the report says that he quote,

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:15.000
And the expert says that in order to find a correct probability of me changing the drop rates, quote,

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:22.000
external evidence that the probabilities were modified at this specific point would be needed to produce a significant probability of cheating.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:27.000
Essentially, the fact that something unlikely happened shouldn't be the only evidence to back up an accusation.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:34.000
I'll preface this by saying that I'm not an astrophysicist, I've dabbled in statistics, but I'd be lying if I said much of it beyond A-Level had stuck with me.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:40.000
Even if you've only dabbled, you'd know something was fundamentally wrong with Dream's response and explanation.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:49.000
Although it's true that the world is based on chance and anarchy to an extent, once you grant the fact that there were statistical bases for the possibility of particular outcomes relating to item drops,

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:57.000
the idea that Dream had that magnitude of good fortune just does not seem viable, even if the odds were less than 1 in 7.5 trillion.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:07.000
If a game involves aspects of randomness and chance, is it possible for one player to be so lucky while playing that game,

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:14.000
that we can say, with mathematical certainty, that they are officially too lucky?

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:19.000
I don't really want to go into much further depth related to this. There's an excellent video by Stand Up Maths on the subject,

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:26.000
which basically deconstructs all the documents in question, including Dream's astrophysicist comrade, who seems to be lacking academic diligence.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:34.000
And here, this number, the actual odds come out to be about 1 in 6300. That number is incorrect.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:38.000
And this is within their own hypothetical situation they came up with.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:44.000
The idea that if you flip a coin 100 times, what's the chance that you get 20 heads in a row?

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:49.000
And I ran the simulations myself and discovered they must have simulated it for heads and tails,

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:57.000
and then to compensate for the fact that it's just heads, they accidentally divided by 2 when they should have multiplied by 2.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:02.000
And that's why they're out by a factor of 4. And it totally changes the thrust of their argument,

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:08.000
because it moves what they claim is the correct answer from one side of approximation to the other.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:16.000
And it's just indicative of a lack of care and attention when putting together even their own hypothetical examples.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:21.000
Do I think that Dream hired a person who he believed to be an incredibly qualified mathematician?

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:27.000
For sure, I highly doubt that anyone without some sort of maths aptitude would bother to write something like this,

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:34.000
let alone have the capability to write it. However, it feels like they were probably dragged from one of those essay writing companies

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:38.000
who flood your DMs when you tweet your frustration at your latest English assignments.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:43.000
Whatever Dream was paying them wasn't enough to cover up the fact that there were still some glaring questions that hadn't been addressed.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:49.000
It certainly didn't take long for r slash statistics to dissect the document and for videos to spring up publicizing this,

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:52.000
with momentum once more gradually turning against him.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:56.000
I already apologized on Twitter because I had said some rude things to the mods after the video was released,

01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:02.000
and I really don't want to send hate to anybody. I responded incredibly immaturely at first because I was angry and I really do regret my response.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:07.000
But I would think that the average person being falsely publicly accused might react in a similar way. I don't know.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:10.000
I'm very competitive, so being called a cheater just really set me off at first.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:13.000
However, a lot of his audience stood by him, for one key reason,

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:16.000
that from their point of view, Dream didn't really have an impetus to lie.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:19.000
It wasn't the biggest deal, there are much more pressing matters in the world,

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:22.000
and Dream wouldn't make a sincere appeal to his supporters otherwise,

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:25.000
their support surely wouldn't hinge on such a trivial matter.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:29.000
Some audience members were publicly taking matters into their own hands,

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:32.000
taunting those involved, even echoing Dream's own comments.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:37.000
If Dream had cheated, or even unknowingly played on modest settings, surely he would have no problem coming clean about it.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:43.000
Hell, this is a sentiment he echoed a few months later in a drama relating to another creator by the name of John Swan,

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:46.000
who is no stranger to this channel in a different capacity.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:49.000
John Swan in that case was completely in the wrong, and Dream was in the right,

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
but these words would come back to haunt him once more.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:21.000
Dream and his fans felt like they were joined to the hit through this,

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:24.000
and it was in many ways the ultimate test of mutual loyalty.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:30.000
The fact that Dream was positioning himself against every logical and rational explanation put forward by the Minecraft community,

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:33.000
they didn't want to accept his speedrun because statistically,

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:37.000
it did not seem possible that it was achieved under competitive conditions.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:40.000
They had a greater volume of coherent evidence, and under scrutiny,

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:43.000
Dream's narrative struggled to hold water, yet Dream's support never waned.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:48.000
In fact, it felt like it had been fortified, this idea that it was Dream versus the world.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:51.000
Even if there was a valid reason that the world was against him,

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:54.000
it could be a rewarding experience being the person to stand behind him.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:58.000
However, the downside of this is that you ultimately reward the wrong behaviour,

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:04.000
it's the exact same reason Trump was so successful, but also such a morally dubious person, in my humble opinion.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:10.000
With me, I'm pretty young, so I feel like if I do anything I've done, I've definitely done stupid stuff in the past,

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:15.000
but I do stupid things, I learn from them, and then I grow, and I think my audience recognises that.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:18.000
In many ways, I do think that stands were unfairly characterised by critics.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:23.000
I don't think that there are a huge number of aggressive, unpleasant individuals who are part of these communities.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:28.000
I also feel that many did prioritise their loyalty to a creator who defended them over the actual logical truth,

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:32.000
and maybe that's what being a Stan is in a way, like Dream said himself.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:35.000
Like being a sports fan, like being a celebrity devotee,

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:39.000
that we are more predisposed to stand by them, even if the odds are stacked against them.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:43.000
But this is YouTube, and people call stuff out not on the basis of whether it's natural,

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:48.000
but on the basis of whether it's right, and something didn't sit right with a lot of people about Dream's demeanour.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:53.000
To them, even though he had turned his back on other communities, he still wanted to profit all the same.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:58.000
He wanted to have his cake and eat it, and was regularly bullish in confrontation with those who questioned him,

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:01.000
even if, at his size, he was massively punching down.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:04.000
This was a divide that only deepened by the conduct of his detractors.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:08.000
Gio Square, the moderator who published the original document and corresponding video,

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:15.000
would find himself under criticism after creating a burner account to disseminate rumours that Dream had openly used racial slurs a few years prior.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:19.000
These allegations were later assumedly proven false, and Gio Square published an apology,

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:23.000
but the professionalism of someone who was supposedly on a moderation team was brought into question,

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:26.000
and this idea of bias was probably kept in mind again.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:32.000
It certainly undermined this idea of him being a neutral observer, even if his original assertions were correct.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:35.000
And a lot of people were upset with that because they couldn't see how they could be biased.

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:40.000
I just want to share my point of view because from my perspective, maybe you can understand why I reacted the way that I did.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:44.000
First of all, the speedrun.com Minecraft Bedrock Edition team, which is a similar team to the one who worked on this,

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:50.000
but for Bedrock Edition, completely banned me from ever submitting an official run, well before this happened,

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:53.000
without giving a single reason why. Other than that, they don't like me.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:58.000
And I have never even played Minecraft Bedrock Edition or done a single speedrun on that game.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
But I'm still banned, and I have yet to be told why.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:05.000
Obviously, this didn't give me as much confidence in their sister team, Java Edition, giving me fair treatment.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:09.000
However, I don't think that the actions of the Bedrock Team reflect on the intentions of the Java Team.

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:12.000
Another thing, though, is that while the mods were looking into my 1.16 run,

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:18.000
a lot of the official speedrun verifiers were saying incredibly disrespectful things about me, about my fans, and essentially harassing me,

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:24.000
which obviously led to me saying some things that I regret saying, but I'm sure that anyone can understand why that would be frustrating.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:30.000
That's important to note, regardless of what could be said about Dream, his critics often didn't immerse themselves in glory either,

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:36.000
and for supporters of the YouTuber who may be subconsciously looking for ways to discredit those individuals, it really wasn't that hard.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:40.000
When you're calling into question someone's character, you really have to be careful what you say.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:46.000
The official owners and admins of speedrun.com, which run the leaderboard, made a statement that the video was, quote,

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:54.000
lacking in the level of objectivity we hope to see around communications by the game moderation team to the community, which I completely agree with.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:58.000
Those who weren't fans, though, the reasons to dislike Dream just continued to multiply,

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:02.000
whether it was his attitude, his PR, or their own run-ins with viewers of his.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:09.000
This renewed relationship spurred on by the speedrunning situation seemed to only serve to show everything destructive about his approach,

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
and not just for the Minecraft communities.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:30.000
In months coming, the focus of the narrative seemed to shift.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:34.000
There was still criticism surrounding how Dream fans acted, but it also went onto Dream,

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:41.000
and how he acted, how he appealed to his fans, how people felt he mobilised them, and how he subsequently responded to those who called him out.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:44.000
I think the worst thing about it for many people was how contrived it seemed.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:49.000
A lot of people had received a lot of blowback from these dramas that could have easily been set aside,

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:55.000
but Dream just couldn't help himself, he wouldn't yield a lot of the time either, and that amplified a lot of the harm that people faced.

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:13.000
Dream was always slightly at odds with his audience, at least personality-wise, and his roots show in his behaviour.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:17.000
He's a very proud person, he's instinctively very defensive of his nature.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:24.000
When people do attack him, he wants to stand up for himself, and he has done, even at times when, to be honest, I don't think it was worth doing.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:30.000
For example, in March when he launched some new merchandise, maybe he'll decide to call him out because they thought it was a bit, well, minimalist to put it mildly.

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:38.000
Now in Dream's defence, the smiley face is probably the most noteworthy aspect of his brand, but that doesn't mean you just have to print it on a shirt without any additional personality.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:45.000
However, once again, proud of the work that he had done, he responded, first tweeting the Dream classic know you argument.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:49.000
After all, everyone who was attacking him was a massive Supreme fan, I'm sure.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:55.000
Not to mention that I'm pretty certain Nike and other brands actually do put a bit of effort into the design of their products.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:56.000
Emphasis on the bit.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:02.000
Dream then suggests that it's all well and good being able to draw his merch in paint, but could the average fault finder manage to accomplish

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:08.000
many of the other feats he had achieved during this intricate operation in the formation of such a piece of artistic triumph?

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:16.000
Well, a lot of people's response was, yes, I think a lot of people could, because unless Dream was down on the front line stitching the shirts himself,

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
a lot of this is executive management.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:24.000
A majority of large creators have merchandise because they can outsource a lot more of the more strenuous aspects of production,

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
and it means it's less work for them to do.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:33.000
People reiterated these points, and Dream then qualified his own, like he does, explaining that although he didn't articulate it as concisely as he could,

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:39.000
he actually hires and employs his own staff for his plant, maintaining excellent work conditions and paying a livable wage,

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:43.000
which, if true, I'll give him kudos for, but I haven't worked there, so how would I know?

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:46.000
I don't blame Dream for having pride in what he's achieved as a creator.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:51.000
I don't think any old idiot with a microphone could have established what he has, but you need to be grounded with your responses,

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:55.000
and every time Dream was called out, he seemed to react in a way that did not reflect that.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:14:00.000
Now, he'd eventually adjust the viewpoint to be more empathetic, but it was too late every time.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:05.000
He didn't directly start a battle between his audience and his critics, and by the time he has finally worked out what to say,

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:10.000
people have probably had their accounts suspended, arguing a point that didn't even have to be made in the first place.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:13.000
But don't worry, he'll tweet a love part out, whatever.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:19.000
Those who hate him bill it as dishonest, someone causing a load of unnecessary collateral damage and then trying to kiss it better.

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:23.000
Now, what many see as disingenuous, I personally see as a creator maybe a bit out of his depth.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:29.000
Trying to appeal to an audience he never really requested, but also trying to maintain his own sense of self.

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:33.000
Regardless, it's what many began to bill as the Dream Cycle, and every time it occurred,

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:38.000
it only emphasised that pattern of behaviour that, to them, seemed so tired and played out.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:41.000
In many ways, it felt like Dream had much more in common with his critics than his stans,

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:44.000
but couldn't align himself with the people so blatantly against him.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:48.000
Stans are instinctively far more socially conscious than Dream has ever been.

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:51.000
And may well ever be, and that's no surprise.

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:57.000
We all know Dream has had his fair share of gamer moments and interesting opinions that many people around him held too.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:00.000
And as we've noted earlier, he clearly wanted to move away from that,

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:07.000
but his desire to be something he had never truly properly understood before just presented a person who was putting on an act.

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:11.000
There's no problem with someone who's trying to be what they view as the best person they can be.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:16.000
The problem with Dream is that he didn't have a grasp on social conscience with the people he wanted support from,

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:20.000
nor what he was being called out for most of the time, and therefore he never really grew as a person,

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:23.000
and more just tweaked his responses after the fallout.

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
Public persona by focus group, essentially.

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:28.000
This was epitomised recently when he released his song Mask.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:32.000
I have to say, it wasn't my cup of tea, the lyrics themselves are a bit heavy-handed,

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:38.000
anyone who needs to explicitly explain the meaning of their songs in the lyrics twice is clearly missing the mark of songwriting.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:42.000
And the music video, well, I have a lot of thoughts about that one, but I digress.

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:48.000
As expected, plenty of people came after him for his song, for a variety of reasons, some valid, some not so valid,

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:54.000
and Dream responded, because once again, whatever our opinions are, the song clearly meant a lot to him and I'd never take that away.

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:59.000
However, in probably one of the strangest decisions, he responded to arguably the most valid point of them all,

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:04.000
the direction of his video, which drew a lot of criticism for how it approached treatment of mental disorders.

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:09.000
This is a particularly sensitive subject given Dream's younger audience and their responsiveness to his narratives.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:15.000
Nonetheless, maybe Dream had a point to make. What did his response entail though? Well, take a bloody guess.

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:24.000
It was a no-you argument, but this time juxtaposing this criticism with the idea that those attacking him enjoy music that blindly glorifies drugs.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:30.000
However, this was a big mistake on Dream's part because he didn't consider that he was committing what some class as a micro-aggression,

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:36.000
which is basically a subconscious offence of bigotry, where someone unknowingly perpetuates a negative perception of a marginalised group,

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:43.000
and before he knew it, a variety of threads and tweets popped up explaining why it was problematic, with many coming from within his own fanbase.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:48.000
This only deteriorated when he was called out for defending his fanbase against the claim they were anti-black,

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:53.000
which didn't sit well with many in his audience who felt like there were serious shortcomings in how they had been treated.

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:58.000
It wasn't long until Dream removed his tweet and organised a somewhat messy apology.

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:02.000
Initially published to his private, now deleted account, he made it public so all parties concerned could see it.

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:10.000
He states he completely understands why it was harmful and then ticks all the apology boxes by linking other awesome black creators.

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:13.000
But this time, it did not feel right.

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:31.000
There was something rather soulless about Dream's apology, like it was a masquerade.

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:39.000
He said he understood why what he did was hurtful, and although I don't necessarily expect every person to explain exactly why what they did was wrong,

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:43.000
I do question if he really understood at all this time.

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:47.000
Mainly because, incoming hot take, I don't really think he did anything wrong at all.

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:54.000
Sure, his argument was dumb, and it did remind me of the old memes where someone thinks their music is so much deeper than it actually is,

01:17:54.000 --> 01:18:00.000
but outside of that, its purpose was clearly intended to show the shallowness of those who criticise the fact that he mentions medication,

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:08.000
as opposed to the typical drugs. The idea that many of these haters hear songs, talk about drugs and celebrate it, while criticising people who betray them in a more vulnerable light.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:15.000
But okay, that may have been Dream's intent, but he still played into a negative stereotype, that's the point of a microaggression right?

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:23.000
Well, I disagree. People's main argument within a lot of the threads critical of Dream's comment was that the core message behind his statement was rooted in racism,

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:28.000
that being the drugs-drugs comment was very typical of how bigots characterise hip-hop music.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:36.000
This would be a valid point if his comment was designed to attack the music itself, but from my perspective, the comment was fully designed to attack the listener,

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:43.000
Charles and his proverbial friend, who in my opinion sound like the type of suburban frat boys who probably misinterpret the meaning of a lot of rap music that discusses such substances.

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:50.000
Even then, if you want to call back to the classic emo tweet about Nicki Minaj, the point wasn't that Nicki Minaj is hip-hop and therefore bad,

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:54.000
the point was that at the time, the song Stupid Ho was viewed as somewhat shallow.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:19:02.000
What made the meme wrong wasn't that Stupid Ho is actually some profound statement on the state of humanity, apologies to any Nicki stans watching,

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:06.000
but more the fact that whatever song is shallow to some people, people like what they like,

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:11.000
and whether it's shallow or not doesn't mean someone can't enjoy it, it's not really a racist meme, it's just dumb.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:18.000
It's why Stupid Ho is in the caption and not a song by Grandmaster Flash or Common, though I'm sure it wouldn't be hard to take them out of context.

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:24.000
Hell, there's plenty of internal discourse over the current state of hip-hop music from many more experienced artists themselves,

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:31.000
many of whom don't approve of how newer generations of rappers and musicians in general have adapted the struggles in a light that undermines their original message.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:34.000
It's a discussion that's been going on for decades.

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:41.000
Now, there are definitely racists who have made the claim that hip-hop music at its core glorifies drugs, violence, and the rest to attack the black community,

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:46.000
when in reality, it's a much more systemic problem that has been continuously ignored by countless governmental regimes.

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:53.000
However, to tie that back to Dream, when it's not even the point of his tweet, I mean, unless you can really prove that there's a connection,

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:56.000
unless you have a load of studies, it's a real waste of energy.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:01.000
He literally does the bare minimum to contextualise, not even implying the genre of music this could be.

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:08.000
To me, it's absurd, and I feel strange even having to explain it, because you can't really assume much about a comment like that,

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:12.000
and I'm sure if Dream didn't have a commitment to his audience, he would have said it was absurd too.

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:20.000
Instead, we have an empty, grovelling apology which validates a very weak idea of education without people actually learning anything.

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:26.000
Although I think it's important that public figures don't express themselves in a way that could be inflammatory against specific groups of people,

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:32.000
it's also on us and the viewers to try and interpret their words with an openness and trust with regards to what they're trying to say,

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:38.000
and just because we may be hurt or we may interpret it in a cynical way doesn't mean that a person has been hurtful.

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:43.000
We may have just read too much into something, even if we are a part of that affected focus group.

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
That principle is universal.

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:48.000
With that said, in many ways I understand why Dream apologised.

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:54.000
Ultimately, it's one tweet, and in the grand scheme of things, he was probably just exhausted because his thread comes across as just that.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:58.000
It would have been much more trouble to dig his heels in and declare war on all of Twitter,

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:03.000
but it was a sign of the times, of that appeasement, and I think that's what tipped people off outside his fanbase.

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:10.000
However, to understand people's frustration, you have to see this in the full context of his at least now decently sized collection of apologies.

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:14.000
But also for what he didn't apologise for as well.

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:18.000
You see, I didn't just attempt to dissect Dream's tweet to own the people on Twitter.

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:23.000
In fact, I accept that people who were bothered by the tweet's perspective may have a point.

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:24.000
They may be valid.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:28.000
Maybe Dream was right to apologise given that you could interpret his words in such a way,

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:32.000
and people who carry racial trauma feel that trauma resurfacing when certain comments are made.

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:38.000
As someone with my own trauma, my opinions differ on how we should approach others' language that may activate that trauma,

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:41.000
but I accept that this is subjective.

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:46.000
But if Dream is so receptive to apologising for a tweet in which the implication is at best tentative,

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:53.000
why can't he show some sympathy towards people who may be bothered with him having a music video where a young version of himself throws away his medication?

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:57.000
Well, sometimes the question seems dependent on who's upset.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
You remember that old speedrunning Skylark we spoke about?

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
Well, Dream actually did apologise.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:05.000
You wouldn't be blamed for missing it as it was removed less than a week after it was published.

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:08.000
But an apology is an apology, I guess.

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:12.000
And in the apology, Dream explains how after all the drama had transpired,

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:16.000
he had discovered that he was actually using a disallowed mod on the version of the game he was playing,

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
and that he regretted behaving the way he did.

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:21.000
He'd gone through so many emotions at that point, he just wasn't thinking straight.

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
I know the struggle, Dream.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:29.000
He said he planned on letting it die down, but wanted to clear his conscience after the animosity had persisted between himself and the mod team,

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:32.000
and although he doesn't necessarily agree with their behaviour at all points,

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:37.000
he acknowledges that his actions were rash and driven by his own personal judgements of the mod team's intentions,

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:42.000
rather than what could be logically and mathematically drawn from these striking anomalies in his actual performance.

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:47.000
As an apology, it is well written, and manages to explain his perception pretty rationally,

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:51.000
however it didn't wash with many of those who had criticised him for a few reasons.

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:54.000
Firstly, his whole justification for holding off addressing it.

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:58.000
He states he thought he'd let it rest for a few years, and reveal it when no one actually cared anymore,

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000
he didn't want to be the centre of drama again.

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:05.000
However, the problem is that Dream perpetuated the drama, and a lot of hassle against these people,

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:09.000
a fact that he acknowledges himself, saying that it's probably been torture for the mods.

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:13.000
The one thing that I'm sure the mods wanted from this situation is closure,

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:17.000
and as long as the question of whether Dream cheated was contended, they would never have that.

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:21.000
Here, admitting to cheating wouldn't have looked bad on the mod or flared up drama against them,

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:25.000
it wouldn't have upset them more, regardless of what torture they had endured up to that point.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:30.000
Dream tried to make it look like a point of selflessness, and it's just not very convincing.

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:34.000
Other points mainly pertain to how he tonally conveys himself,

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:38.000
there's a lot of comments that people feel were a bit pointed towards the mods,

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
playing up his own history with them to justify his actions,

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:46.000
alongside unsubstantiated and unfalsifiable claims that people feel were placed there to embellish his perspective,

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
and make it feel more justified than it was.

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:53.000
Many found it hard to buy the fact that Dream would go to such lengths to defend something that he wasn't even sure about.

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:58.000
This is the person who tweeted with conviction, who hired mathematicians to justify his point of view,

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:01.000
who published videos, all proclaiming his truth.

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:06.000
The fact that he now says he wasn't even sure just makes it worse given how he used his platform in the first place.

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:12.000
There was no way that the masses in these communities affected were going to forgive him for this.

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:15.000
But was the apology even for them?

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:25.000
On one hand, you had two very different apologies, in their structure, in their presentation, in their actual context.

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:31.000
And that makes sense in a way, after all the latter was a much more serpentine situation, warranting some elaboration.

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:37.000
However, when you analyse the actual language in his belated apology, it's hard to say it's directed towards a different party.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:43.000
There's a lot of emotional language that I wouldn't say is inherently manipulative, but is designed to elicit sympathy from the readers.

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:48.000
However, to elicit sympathy, you need people who are prepared to be sympathetic, and in a YouTuber's case,

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:51.000
the people who are most likely to be sympathetic are your own audience.

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:56.000
Now, maximising understanding is something that is quite normal when explaining anything to anyone.

01:24:56.000 --> 01:25:01.000
I don't want to say that it's a tactic employed to solely win over your fans, but there are distinctions that can be made.

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:08.000
Dream talks about how scared, stressed, angry he was, all the strong emotions that he went through when being challenged on the nature of his speedrun.

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:13.000
These aren't details particularly relevant to the situation for many interested, but they are to those who support him,

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:17.000
and want to assume that he had the best intent, even when he acted dishonourably.

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:21.000
People trying to bring everyone round to their perspective will logically take the route of empathy,

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:26.000
explain their actions in a way that people can identify the mindset when the actions were taken,

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:31.000
and at least make sense of them, even if they don't agree, and this will build a level of respect between the parties involved.

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:36.000
This is present in Dream's confession, but his appeals to sympathy are much more pervasive and noticeable,

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:42.000
and unless you brought people into a position where that's effective, then many will view it as cheap and calculated,

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:45.000
which is exactly how a lot of his detractors interpreted it.

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:51.000
Anyone can be scared, anyone can be stressed, those feelings don't necessarily precipitate the actions documented.

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:58.000
Plenty of other people in fearful mindsets will act differently, it's all about how the person interacts with those feelings on a unique level.

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:03.000
Understanding that is what prevents it from happening again, because lord knows we're all going to be scared,

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:06.000
stressed, and angry again at points in our lives.

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:10.000
I'm going to go out on a limb and say that it's not the worst confession slash apology.

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:16.000
I think the problem was it wasn't directed towards the mods or anyone who was actually involved in this situation,

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
anyone actually deserving of an apology.

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:22.000
It was directed towards the people who Dream believed had a capacity to forgive him,

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:27.000
because whether right or wrong, he clearly has it in his mind that there are people who blindly hate him,

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:31.000
regardless of what he says or does, and it's not worth the effort to try and bring them round to his perspective.

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:37.000
At the same time, this is an issue, because those who were caught in the fallout of this situation probably do deserve a public apology,

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:40.000
and there's no real sign of that in this post.

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:47.000
He says sorry directly once, to quote anyone he let down, which is again, indicative that this is for his audience.

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:50.000
After all, to let someone down, they need to have an expectation of you,

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:54.000
and many of those who didn't like Dream had no expectation in the first place.

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:57.000
To them, this was just him admitting to what they'd always known,

01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:01.000
and even if they'd borne the brunt of his actions, he didn't want to apologise to them,

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:06.000
particularly for any fan antics because he didn't want to play into that narrative of toxicity peddled by them,

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:11.000
and he certainly didn't want to vindicate any of them more than they already would have been through such an admission.

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:18.000
Dream's apology begs us all to move on from the drama, and the reality is that we have.

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:25.000
It's been six months, so why is he in his bathtub at 4am, bringing it up again?

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:32.000
It's because earlier in the day, moderators rejected yet another run of his for cheating,

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:36.000
his 1.15 world record speedrun.

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:44.000
Gotta say it's some really interesting timing for him to suddenly become apologetic about the situation.

01:27:55.000 --> 01:28:00.000
Apologies shouldn't bank on whether they forgive you or not, and you should still apologise if you feel you've done something wrong,

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
even if you know they're not going to forgive you.

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:35.000
When you look at the two apologies side by side, it's not hard to understand why people were bothered.

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:39.000
Dream takes mere hours to apologise for a trivial matter relating to a tweet,

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:43.000
and months to apologise for something that caused people to invest time and effort,

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:48.000
and face down stigma from his audiences for even daring to try and prove something that should have been accepted from the start.

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:52.000
Dream's own principles seem to be based on who was affected,

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:58.000
and of course we'll all have our biases and inconsistencies, it's natural for a creator to be more interested in their own audience,

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:04.000
but there's a line, and for many, Dream crossed it, to the detriment of individual users and greater communities alike.

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:08.000
However, if you choose to believe his version of events presented in the apology,

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:11.000
then many of his supporters would argue that his perspective makes complete sense.

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:14.000
If we go back throughout the video, it also makes sense,

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:18.000
the same pattern that has continuously surfaced throughout the stories, no matter how different they may seem.

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:23.000
The Dream felt persecuted, the Dream felt that there was a narrative being crafted against him and his audience,

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:29.000
and that it was being pushed by those who were envious of his own success, and thriving community.

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:33.000
Although he didn't present any in his pace bin, there was sufficient evidence that the mods did not like him,

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:39.000
and whether his response was logical or not is besides the point, it was human, and certainly not impossible.

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000
That is with the proviso that you believe him of course,

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:44.000
but the fact that it's not off the table is indicative to say the least,

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:47.000
however you can be relatively confident about how his audience felt.

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:52.000
What we witnessed here is essentially a deficit in critical thinking, a product of polarisation.

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:57.000
All it would have taken is a significant group within Dream's circle to publicly challenge his assertions,

01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:03.000
and yet it never really happened because people were so focused on fighting the greater narratives that were being charged against them.

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:07.000
I don't think stands were lying through their teeth to protect them, I think they genuinely believed him,

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:13.000
and from their own perspective, he was one of the only creators who was honest and upfront in characterising their own behaviour,

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:19.000
so by extension, he was going to be a more reliable narrator to them, nobody wanted to desert an ally.

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:25.000
So when he came round to explaining his own perspective, that was rooted in the idea of this deluge of hate towards him.

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:29.000
This resonated with his audience because that's what they felt too, but not his critics,

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:34.000
because only the former concur with the presupposition that he was experiencing disproportionate hate in the first place.

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:39.000
His audience understood where he was coming from, and therefore they by and large forgave him,

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
because what Dream was saying was real to them.

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:43.000
But what is real?

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:57.000
What Dream has created in less than a couple of years is by many means unprecedented,

01:30:57.000 --> 01:31:02.000
therefore one of the typical responses to those critical of him is that it's hard to expect to know exactly how to act,

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:05.000
because there are very few prior examples of it in the YouTube community.

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:10.000
At the same time, as illustrated by the Dream cycle, there seems to be, from many people's perspectives,

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:16.000
this idea that these antics have reached a point of repetition, that Dream may have some degree of self-awareness of what he's doing.

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:20.000
Dream may be the first from the YouTube sphere to experience what we're discussing today,

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:24.000
but he's also experienced it on a continuous basis, and you expect him to have learned by some point.

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:29.000
However, self-awareness does tie into how much responsibility he should take as a creator,

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:32.000
particularly in regards to the more destructive drama.

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:36.000
There's an impulse to a lot of what Dream does on the surface, which in a way makes him relatable to a lot of his audiences.

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:42.000
He portrays himself as a bit emotional and impulsive, and even if he doesn't always do the right thing, he seems to think that he is at the time.

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:45.000
It's that which allows his audience to maintain faith in him.

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:50.000
You can look at a lot of studies in the fan culture that establishes how fans want to see themselves in their idols,

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:55.000
and in spite of every blunder Dream seems to fall afoul of, it only seems to reinforce the bond between the two parties.

01:31:55.000 --> 01:32:03.000
That's epitomised by this 4am confession post that gives off the surface level impression that something has been weighing on his conscience and he just has to talk about it.

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:09.000
But there were a lot of skeptics who believed that this was just another part of the ruse, this simulation of a person who is identifiable to his audience

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:14.000
but is merely exploiting the idea of understanding between them, rather than actually understanding.

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:20.000
The fact that he launched a toxic attack on people who doubted his speedrunning credentials on the same day that he acknowledged that audiences

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:24.000
had the capacity to behave with toxicity themselves seemed too ironic to be sincere.

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:30.000
Even if he genuinely believed he didn't cheat, why would he emotionally rile up his viewers with polarising and divisive language

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:36.000
when he knows exactly what the consequences entail? Is he really that impulsive, or is he really that calculated?

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:39.000
Well, let's have a look at the former first.

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:51.000
Dream can be pretty reactionary, however as his critics have observed this can sometimes be beneficial to him,

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:55.000
particularly when he wants to align himself with his audience's perception of him.

01:32:55.000 --> 01:33:01.000
At the same time, sometimes his responses aren't remotely helpful either, for example, the situation pertaining to his music.

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:05.000
He didn't really receive many thoughts for his comments, just backlash from his own viewers.

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:10.000
And it's not the first time that's happened, it's what he was regularly called out for when he acquired a stand-up,

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:15.000
and although he quickly climbed down from his prior positions, there was no real benefit to what he previously said.

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:21.000
Dream has his own feelings on matters, but at the same time many would question whether it's compatible with the other side of him.

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:44.000
Looking at Dream's apologies and qualifications regularly show a different portrayal,

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:47.000
and that's the one that a lot of those who aren't fond of him see,

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:50.000
a person who doesn't want to face consequences for trouble that they have instigated.

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:55.000
Dream has the ability to be very rational, and even if he has said something that seemed impulsive in the moment,

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:59.000
he clarifies points in a calmer manner down the line. It was rather bemusing in many ways,

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:05.000
it felt like we had two very divisive sides of him, because he clearly showed an ability to be mild and reasonable,

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:09.000
and yet regularly ended up in the firing line of his own comments and subsequent fallout,

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:12.000
whether they be on Twitter, YouTube comment sections, or Discord servers.

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:16.000
Even if it didn't aid him, he still did it, and for many it wore very thin.

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:19.000
But what if it was just a ruse?

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:22.000
When people think of such cynical ploys to exploit demographics,

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:25.000
people often think of large corporations and their rather shallow activism,

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:28.000
designed to reap people's pockets without bringing about real change.

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:32.000
It's often hard to do it on a YouTube level because people often subscribe to you for personal reasons,

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:36.000
for you, and they're often going to notice when you're not really expressing what you truly believe.

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:41.000
Many critics believe they saw something like that within Dream, particularly given his previous positions,

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:46.000
that this wasn't really someone learning, moreover someone manually trying to adjust to his audience's expectations.

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:52.000
Over time, it starts to sound like a broken record, especially when combined with the at-points rather superficial levels of activism.

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:56.000
For example, at the end of May, Dream proudly announced that in the spirit of gay rights,

01:34:56.000 --> 01:35:00.000
all donations from his Twitch streams the following month would be going to LGBT-focused charities,

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000
a heartwarming cause to say the least.

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:07.000
However, Dream then proceeded to not stream until right at the end of June,

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:10.000
with many alleging that he only did it then because he was called out.

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:14.000
You can't really be impulsive in attempting to appear calculated,

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:20.000
but you can be calculated in attempting to appear impulsive, and I think that idea was solidified with his pace bin.

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:26.000
But given that he also says, by his standard, stupid shit on a regular basis, it's obviously not the full picture.

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:32.000
So what is? I think the Dream is impulsively defensive and deliberately apologetic.

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:37.000
I don't think it's what he's used to, but I think he often feels pushed in a position to do so,

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:41.000
mainly due to the expectation of those who don't really have that much in common with him.

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:45.000
The problem is that on one hand his apologies take the boxes and do the job,

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:50.000
the Stans accept it because he admits that what he did was wrong and that at the end of the day it's not that big a deal,

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:54.000
but the issue is that in those scenarios it provides the illusion of personal growth,

01:35:54.000 --> 01:36:00.000
when in many cases these apologies are done with a hollowness because they don't touch into what causes the issue in the first place,

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:04.000
which is, in my opinion, Dream's own nature to be provocative.

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:10.000
Not insensitive, not conservative, but provocative, and I think Stans have struggled to account for this as well.

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:27.000
Music

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:32.000
Not too long after Dream admitted to his malfeasance, he ended up on a stream with Hassan Piker,

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:36.000
a popular leftist twitch streamer who had tumbled down the Dream rabbit hole a few days prior.

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:39.000
Hassan had made some pretty charged statements against Dream himself.

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:43.000
What the fuck are you guys doing? Do you know nothing?

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:50.000
Like, do all you know is just like Minecraft eat hot chip and fucking make like Minecraft tweets?

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:53.000
Bro, that's literally, he's literally like platforming.

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000
Oh my lord, dude.

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:02.000
Oh my god, that shit is fucking wild, dude.

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:11.000
Bro, listen, instead of freaking out, instead of freaking the fuck out, yeah, he said Pizzagate is real.

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000
Good start, good way to start this.

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:20.000
You guys lose your shit over like Carl Jacobs being a fucking Ice Poseidon fan at some point or some shit,

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000
or washing ice Poseidon.

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:28.000
That is unhelpful, like attacking Carl Jacobs or that is ridiculous, okay?

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:35.000
Attacking like your favorite content creators and like writing massive fucking threads about how,

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:45.000
about how like it's problematic to bring up slavery in any capacity in a fucking video game roleplay scenario.

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:48.000
A thread is ridiculous.

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:56.000
Just having Notch on a video like this with 60 million views is significantly fucking worse.

01:37:56.000 --> 01:38:06.000
To have Notch in 2020 on your fucking 16.5 million view video game, like this is years after,

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:11.000
literally fucking years after, like when everybody knew what the fuck Notch was,

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:16.000
when Microsoft did everything they could to separate themselves from Notch.

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:17.000
That's wild, dude.

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:22.000
How the fuck are you going to sit there and cancel like TommyInnit or Carl Jacobs

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:27.000
when Dream is just like fucking chilling with Notch, dude?

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:32.000
Which, as always, led Dream to escalate the situation, put out some rash treats, all that jazz.

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:36.000
However, this time, because once again, these were social issues pertaining to Dream's previous work,

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:39.000
and his fanbase had some strong feelings on those matters,

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:43.000
he was quickly compelled to retract these comments and actually resolve any hostility,

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:46.000
going on to stream with Hasan to discuss these issues.

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:49.000
I'll be using clips from that stream to parallel the narratives in this part.

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:51.000
Hello.

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:52.000
What's good?

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:53.000
How's it going?

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:54.000
Alright, talk to me, Dream.

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:58.000
When we have a Dream apology or clarification, particularly to his fans,

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000
it will normally go down the route of ignorance,

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:05.000
that our good Minecrafting friend here didn't realise what he said was going to negatively affect people.

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:10.000
It's not what he intended to say or do, even if his words or actions were driven by a sincere sentiment,

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:14.000
but it doesn't happen on a regular basis to many other YouTubers in his position,

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:17.000
and that's not just because of the haters or the stans.

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:23.000
When I was like, when I was like 16, and Trump was first running, I thought Trump was like, funny.

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:27.000
And that was obviously, I was like an idiot kid growing up, like you mentioned, in Florida,

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:32.000
in a red area, going to online school, you know, being homeschooled, like,

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:35.000
it was a total product of my environment, I said that.

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:38.000
I think many creators have the capacity to offend the masses with their thoughts,

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:43.000
because we all have selfish thoughts, we all have defensive thoughts, we all have unpalatable thoughts.

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000
I think it's in the instincts of many people.

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:48.000
It's just the difference is we keep them as thoughts.

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:51.000
When you're a large creator, you need to train yourself to have a filter.

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:56.000
Dream has often lacked that, the ability to just know when to say absolutely nothing.

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.000
There's nothing wrong with having pride in what you create,

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:01.000
I understand why people trying to deride your work may bother you,

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:05.000
but you don't have to go out of your way to attack them as long as you know it's good.

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000
You're not going to change their mind that way,

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:10.000
all you're doing is placing yourself in the crossfire for more conflict.

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000
In a way, I think Dream knew that though,

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:16.000
that his method of tweeting wasn't going to make him many new friends,

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:19.000
he was just channeling the outspoken gamer he'd always been.

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:22.000
A lot of people in that community talk a lot of shit,

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:23.000
we've spoken about that before.

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:27.000
I think the problem is that Dream's popularity intersects with a fandom,

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:31.000
and a greater community who didn't necessarily perceive the issues the same way he did.

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000
To them, his strongly worded comments would hold a lot more weight,

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000
and when Dream spoke in an inflammatory way,

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:39.000
when he had his heated gamer moments, people would act on it.

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:42.000
He'd end up in these ridiculous back and forth with creators

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000
who probably took things far more seriously than they should have,

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:47.000
with audiences who were far too invested themselves.

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:04.000
But Dream somehow always managed to end up taking things seriously himself,

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:08.000
and instead of saying, hey, I overreacted, which is 90% of Dream's problem,

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:12.000
he'd often then react to it in a way that escalated the situation again.

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:15.000
I feel like this is because he was aware that people cared by then,

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.000
and he didn't want to appear like he was disinterested.

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:21.000
He didn't want people to feel like they'd spent whatever allotted amount of time

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:24.000
arguing over something that he was hardly paying any mind to.

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:27.000
Dream likes to make supporting him a rewarding experience,

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:30.000
which is why he tweets out her love hearts at the end of every online argument,

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:33.000
because he doesn't want people to think that it's a fruitless venture.

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:36.000
However, in those cases, it kind of provides the impression

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:39.000
that he's pulling his fans aside and saying, good job,

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000
like when someone pretends to rep around a person,

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000
but is saying something different in confidence.

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000
In a way, I don't think it's exactly that.

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:48.000
I think it's more a thank you for continuing to support me,

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:52.000
but I think it's usage kind of leads people to thinking he can't control his audience,

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:56.000
and that what matters to him is their retention, whatever the cost for others,

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:59.000
and that he's going to condone this continued problem.

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:03.000
It feels like Dream's in this position where he's always reluctant to say or even imply too much,

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000
because he doesn't want his audience to read it as an attack on them,

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:10.000
while many want him to say more because they feel like it could prevent some of the anguish faced by those outside the fandom.

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.000
I know that's why people call it the Dream cycle,

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:16.000
but sometimes it's more important to notice the cycle of those you're interacting with as well,

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.000
and the greater cycle of behaviour.

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:21.000
It reached a point where it didn't matter who said what or what they did,

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000
people linked it back to Dream and his fanbase,

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:29.000
which in turn made them defensive and instigated this endless palaver over Dream's responsibility as a creator,

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.000
one side wanting to hold him responsible for everything,

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:34.000
and the other for practically nothing, when the truth is a lot more grey.

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:39.000
You really need to look at how Dream mobilises his haters as well as his fans.

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:09.000
On one hand, you have the Minecraft community, the speedrunning community,

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:12.000
these people who care a lot about their game and the respect for their game.

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:15.000
Dream straight up told them that he doesn't really care for Minecraft,

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:19.000
while being one of the main benefactors and faces of the game's resurgence.

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:22.000
He regularly posts comments in the sections of videos that were critical of him,

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:25.000
sometimes they were composed, other times, not so much.

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:28.000
This made more and more enemies out of prospectively neutral parties,

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:33.000
particularly in the commentary genre, who are often frothing in the mouth for YouTuber controversies and subpar responses.

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:36.000
And to be honest, Dream never did anything overly offensive,

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:40.000
he just pissed people off, and then didn't really address why he pissed people off.

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:43.000
A lot of his gestures felt perfunctory, and his activism felt performative.

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:46.000
Stans may be happy that Dream regularly agreed with them,

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:49.000
but people outside that circle just felt it was fraudulent.

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:52.000
Dream provoked his adversaries, the adversaries provoked Dream.

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000
The difference is that Dream never apologised to them,

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:58.000
even when he may have acted out of line, reason being due to this cycle.

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:01.000
Dream didn't feel the need to apologise to people who already hated him,

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:04.000
so when he apologised to his audience for the smallest of transgressions,

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:07.000
people thought Dream was giving them special treatment, which of course he was,

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:11.000
but it just increased that desire to call him out on a continuous basis.

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:14.000
It wasn't just a dream cycle, it was a general cycle.

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:18.000
People that are younger and stuff, some people have comprehension issues,

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:20.000
some people have a harder time understanding things.

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:25.000
I try and be... you're probably not used to it as much as I am,

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:29.000
so I kind of recognise when I say things, I try and say them in a way that can be consumed by the most people,

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:33.000
and understood that way, it's like, okay, there's no misinterpretations, right?

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:35.000
Yeah, I'm...

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:36.000
It's just different styles.

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:40.000
Yet, often the Stans receive the backlash as well for being the ones to complain,

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.000
and although, as I said at the start,

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:45.000
Stans have a much greater independent consciousness than a typical fanbase,

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:49.000
I don't think there's anything wrong with that, I just disagree with them sometimes.

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:53.000
It's not their fault that Dream regularly apologised to them when they pointed out

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000
that Dream had said or done something that had bothered them,

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:58.000
whether I personally believe they were writing that or not.

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:02.000
A lot of people resented Stans for even raising a lot of these issues at all,

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:05.000
when in reality, they were doing exactly what other communities were doing

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.000
when Dream said something that bothered them.

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:10.000
The difference was that they could solicit an apology because they were on his side,

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:11.000
they were tactful.

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:14.000
When there was a problem, they'd frame it through the lens of education,

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.000
which made it a lot easier for Dream to respond to.

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:19.000
They were also fairly small issues, making them easier to correct.

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:21.000
Their greatest weakness was being too passively appeased,

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:25.000
but at the same time, they're a fanbase, what can you expect?

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.000
I'm glad we could clear the air that way.

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:31.000
Fans who have nothing to do with the situation wouldn't be at each other's throats.

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:35.000
In his apologies, Dream never addressed the fact that he's just a provocative person,

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:38.000
that he clearly has tendencies rooted in that rather proud mindset,

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:42.000
and so it just kept happening again and again and again.

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000
The apologies were born mostly at convenience,

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:47.000
and even if he learned a bit more social awareness here and there,

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:50.000
he didn't seem to garner self-awareness for his own position as a powerful creator

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.000
whose words can hold a lot of weight.

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:55.000
I think a lot of people blame Stan Gulch primarily for this,

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:57.000
and Dream secondarily for enabling it,

01:45:57.000 --> 01:46:00.000
but funnily enough, I think I've come to the opposite conclusion.

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.000
Allow me to explain why.

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:05.000
People weren't that critical of what I had to say,

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:09.000
so if you feel bad about you tweeting and then deleting it

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000
and then having people come over here...

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:25.000
I hope we can all broadly agree that a majority of Stans are not bad people.

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000
I don't believe that, I don't think most people believe that.

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000
However, the issue of question is the culture,

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:33.000
and even if it is a vocal minority, is the minority too vocal to ignore?

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:37.000
I bring the very typical religion analogy that many people tend to turn to when discussing these queries.

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:40.000
Religion as a whole has helped a lot of people,

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.000
but at the same time has caused a lot of harm in Greek.

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:46.000
Now, it shouldn't be invalidating any of the legitimate positive change that people derive from religion.

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:50.000
However, it's the philosophical question of whether we should settle for something so imperfect.

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:54.000
When Josh Padau tweeted in December, it wasn't an attack on any specific Stans,

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.000
it was an attack on Stan culture as a whole.

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:59.000
His perspective seemed to focus on collectivism and the toxic ramifications

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:03.000
of what he described as prioritising group cohesion over the rights of the individual.

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:07.000
Now, I've already spoken about the problems with the deficit of critical thinking that can occur in these circles,

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:12.000
I do want to break down this discourse one more time to fully arbitrate a fair outlook on the nature of Stans.

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:17.000
Josh's theories of statements are a fair bit to unpack and I'm not going to discuss at all,

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:20.000
but in essence what he's saying is that Dream Twitter and other Stan Twitters

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:24.000
extract the identity of the individual in the desire for a greater cause,

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:29.000
in this case the example of the cause is Dream, and the devoted support for him in all his pursuits.

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:32.000
He believes that this behaviour is the product of unhealthy mindsets,

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.000
and instead of people finding help these issues,

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:39.000
it is promoted in the confines of these obsessive communities with other people who are also suffering,

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:42.000
vicariously living through an idol's achievements and occasional shortcomings.

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:46.000
These people may feel better for the moment, but is it the best solution for them

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:50.000
when there are other notable drawbacks for people inside and outside of these communities?

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:54.000
Just because something may seem like a broad net positive, should we not try to do better?

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:58.000
Now, Josh didn't always put this quite as tactfully as I have, but that's the gist of his thesis.

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:01.000
Does he have a point? Is Stan culture inherently toxic?

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000
Can you resolve something that is systemically corrupt?

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:08.000
And where do Dream and his Stans factor into this specific philosophy?

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:14.000
Collectivism is a prickly subject, because I think it's hard to find someone who is truly above being part of some sort of collective,

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:16.000
as well as being influenced by it.

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:22.000
It's seldom absolute, and I don't doubt that a lot of Stans have their own personalities, beliefs, and identities,

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:26.000
so it's really about looking at everything we've discussed today and trying to establish what is human nature,

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:30.000
and what is exceptional, and on the surface, I'd say a lot of this is human nature.

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:34.000
However, I think the most defining feature of Stan groups, as opposed to normal fans,

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:38.000
is that they do have a nature to assemble in a way that can bring mass momentum,

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:41.000
and sometimes this is a good thing, but it can also be quite overwhelming.

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:47.000
In the olden glory days of YouTube, fans never really had that platform to organise in such a way,

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000
and therefore retained some perception of independence,

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:56.000
but yet the increasing interconnectivity between platforms and Twitter have enabled the assembly and growth of these communities.

01:48:56.000 --> 01:49:02.000
The evidence we've reviewed today shows that there is plenty of toxic YouTube behaviour that probably isn't just Stan's.

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:07.000
That's an omnipresent feature of YouTube, but what we see is a synchronisation of behaviour,

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:12.000
a consensus, a camaraderie, which can sometimes override that own critical process.

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:19.000
To me, Standom is just an outcome of fandom on a more macro level, and that can be demonstrated elsewhere.

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:23.000
I understand how somebody that isn't a creator might feel creepy if someone does this to them,

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.000
like they had a profile picture with your face on it or something,

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:30.000
but to a creator it's no different to a celebrity, or a football player, or any popular figure.

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:36.000
Dream already discussed this in his own video, comparing the nature of Stan's to those of very dedicated sports fans,

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:39.000
and in some ways, it's not an undeserved comparison.

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:42.000
People live through their sporting heroes at any age,

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:49.000
and people can become far too invested to the point where you could reliably say that they indulge in behaviour that does not represent their idols,

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000
particularly when they're in large groups.

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:57.000
Hooliganism in the name of factualism, to a much worse degree, is not a rare occurrence in these circles.

01:49:57.000 --> 01:50:00.000
However, I think there is a key difference, one that we've kind of dabbled in already,

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:03.000
but not with the level of responsibility that it probably carries,

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:07.000
and that simple fact is that these sporting legends don't live online.

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:10.000
This isn't to say that they can't be negatively affected by fans, and honestly,

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:14.000
comparing your Standom to sports fans is not the most flattering thing one can do.

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:17.000
However, when it all gets too much for them, they can close down their PC,

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:22.000
comfortable in the thought that the decision they just made won't greatly affect their ability to perform their job.

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:27.000
It's not the same with YouTubers, this level of dedication wasn't really designed to exist in the online sphere,

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:31.000
and I think at a time where mental health is so delicate amongst content creators,

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:37.000
Stan's don't necessarily help a situation, even if they're not trying to necessarily stir stuff up,

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:40.000
particularly when they're emotionally involved to the point where people feel overwhelmed,

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:45.000
or they decide to take up a cause against a singular or limited party all at once.

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:49.000
This is not exceptional either though, but Dream Stands have been made out of an example,

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:55.000
they're a very visible target, and they allow for creators to craft a digestible narrative around a familiar subject,

01:50:55.000 --> 01:51:00.000
but it's also their presence. In a way, their rise was almost as sudden as Dream in mid 2020,

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:03.000
and you're going to cause a bit of whiplash when that happens.

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:08.000
They're not the worst, I know creators and music critics who have received far greater help from some of their subjects' fanatics,

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:16.000
but Dream Stands' position as YouTuber enthusiast means that any fallout of incidents is felt more intensely for some people.

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:21.000
Although seemingly experiencing the whiplash at first as well, Dream has acclimated to it and embraced it,

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:25.000
sometimes though a bit too much. Private Twitter is with hundreds of thousands of followers,

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:29.000
calling his fans kittens, the love bombings, situations we've already discussed.

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:35.000
They promote this sense of parasocial intimacy that is obviously going to make people more attached to you whether you mean to or not.

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:39.000
Make no mistake, I don't think it's wrong to extend love and kindness to those in your fanbase,

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:45.000
but I think you can do it in ways that also doesn't promote this illusion of closeness that makes people more committed than they need to be.

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:52.000
If stands of other public figures have shown, as a force of influence, you don't need to feed the beast too regularly to guarantee its loyalty.

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:59.000
So with this in mind, would some of us derive greater benefit from returning to the more individual, independent-based sense of fandom?

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:04.000
Yes, I don't think you should undermine the negative experience, even if it is a minority.

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:10.000
We've seen that a small group of people can still wield a lot of power, and even when it's not intended to be negative,

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:17.000
there can be real negative ramifications. Life probably would be a lot more of a peaceful journey for many of us without this.

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:21.000
However, this is more than just us, what benefits these people?

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:27.000
Josh really tried to hammer home the point that the people in these groups are just exacerbating their own mental illnesses,

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:31.000
and I don't know how I feel about that point, I really tried to think about it.

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:38.000
Maybe in a few years time, when it's clear, we'll be able to analyse the actual outcome of stand culture as people get older and move on from this,

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:42.000
but a community for a lot of people can take them out of a very dark place,

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:50.000
and sometimes a better support group is the first step to helping yourself out of that pit, maybe in a way that other outlets can't.

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:54.000
This shouldn't negate the harm that's been inflicted onto people, and I never want to do that.

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:56.000
Harassment is never acceptable.

01:52:56.000 --> 01:53:01.000
Clearly some people just don't feel like they have the breathing space they once did with older audiences,

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:07.000
and I don't think people like Josh make their arguments with bad faith, I believe they're rooted in legitimate experience.

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:10.000
The question is, can you remove the bad without removing the good?

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:14.000
Is it always doomed to fail and leave us worse off than we have been before?

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:19.000
At the start of this part, I mention religion, and although there are some parallels, there are also great differences,

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:24.000
and whereas religion in many ways is deeply rooted to the point that we struggle to effect societal change around it,

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:27.000
I'd like to think that stand culture isn't past that point.

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:32.000
One glaring difference is that we actually have a contemporary figure at the centre of this drama

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:38.000
who can speak openly and positively influence communities who will listen to him, Dream himself.

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:47.000
The best argument for Dream's position, outside of everything we've already discussed,

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:53.000
is that a lot of these situations just are not big deals, and to be frank, Dream would be completely entitled to adopt this position.

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:57.000
Even the Minecraft situation was only a big deal because he made it a big deal,

01:53:57.000 --> 01:54:03.000
otherwise it would have had very few negative implications, and it still didn't for his status as a creator.

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:08.000
Many claimed his own stands expected too much of him politically, which I think is a valid point.

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:11.000
These people became famous through playing Minecraft, not for their social activism.

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:14.000
There's only one key factor to his detriment though,

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:19.000
the fact that he already addressed things that were fundamentally not big deals again and again and again,

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:24.000
and tried to involve himself on these matters, and validated everyone's concerns with his behaviour.

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:31.000
After all the high-stakes stuff, it feels strange that this drama has probably had the most people talking given how minor it could hypothetically be.

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:37.000
A lot of people place the responsibility for Dream's softening due to this idea of hostile stands,

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:43.000
but I don't think that's the entire picture. Do stands care too much about stuff that I think personally is rather relevant?

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:49.000
Yeah, that's my opinion, but it's Dream's decision to also care and endorse a culture that can be unhealthy.

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:52.000
I can't say I'm a massive stan of anyone myself, sorry J. Aubrey,

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:57.000
but I think its evolution as a phrase is something a lot less harmful today than the one it was originally created.

01:54:57.000 --> 01:55:01.000
I do think that a significant portion of these communities are pretty amiable,

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:06.000
most want to focus on positivity and supporting a creator they look up to, with the occasional dabbling in social justice.

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:09.000
Are there bad stands? Definitely, and I might mention them in a bit,

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:17.000
but I'd say Dream stands on the whole are probably milder than a lot of other stands for more mainstream artists who can be very unpleasant.

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:21.000
I don't think stan culture at its core is a rotten philosophy,

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:26.000
I don't think many people really provided too much substantial evidence to back this idea.

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:31.000
I think one of the universal downsides to being a stan or a fan is that it does sometimes compromise your ability to think critically

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:35.000
in pursuit of your desire to seek validation from the creator that you admire.

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:42.000
Equally, I think it's allowed an us vs them idea to take precedence which has allowed some real concerning behaviour to seep into the fanbases.

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:48.000
To this day, Dream is tweeting out to remind the haters how bad they actually are, how they're so much worse than the stans,

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:52.000
and I don't know if I need to remind anyone, but it's not a competition.

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:55.000
Even if this statement was true, it does not help at all,

01:55:55.000 --> 01:56:01.000
creating this image of a greater evil only serves to pit people against each other further and validate deleterious behaviour.

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:05.000
My friend Cordwood, another creator who has covered this topic, went through a pretty rough time last year,

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:10.000
during a lot of drama relating to John Swan and other individuals in the community that was generally not his fault.

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:16.000
During this, some of the messages that he received from people who identified themselves as stans were truly vile,

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:21.000
and I understand that there will always be bad apples, but tell me, is this normal?

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:23.000
It doesn't feel normal to me.

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:26.000
Should we calculate who's worse? Does that aid the situation?

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:30.000
How would someone who's not an experienced creator deal with this level of hatred?

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:34.000
The truth is, I don't think Dream or his stans really did anything heinous at the start,

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:39.000
I think he probably could have been a bit more vocal about what sort of behaviour from his audiences he viewed as acceptable,

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:44.000
and I feel he was always focused on defending one point of view rather than looking at the bigger picture,

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:47.000
but there's always a proportion of viewers who will be beyond your control.

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:52.000
A lot of the time, the size of Dream's audience amplifies some of the negative experiences of other creators,

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:56.000
I think the real problem comes with Dream's own personality in dealing with these situations.

01:56:57.000 --> 01:57:00.000
His tweets on the question of his stans were subpar responses,

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:05.000
in my opinion, it was definitely what his stans wanted to hear, but it wasn't what they needed to hear.

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:09.000
I think people may have been overreacting to a degree and fixating on a few negative experiences,

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:13.000
but Dream's own handling often left people feeling like he was taking the piss out of them,

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:17.000
like, ooooh Dream, funny accountable tweet, come on man.

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:20.000
By the time he came around and uploaded a video or thread explaining what he really meant,

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:25.000
people had already made up their own minds, because it's easier to go with a sentence long tweet than watch a 10 minute video,

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:28.000
it's easier to go with a provocative image of a person than a nuanced one,

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:31.000
and that does not help when the person is inherently provocative.

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:37.000
Dream dropped into conversations that dared to name drop him and bestow his occasionally heedless wisdom onto them as well.

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:41.000
In spite of claiming to realise the responsibility that he wielded with such a committed audience,

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:44.000
he'd regularly just use social media without care for the actual consequences,

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:47.000
against people who called him out, against people who challenged him,

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:50.000
despite the fact that many people had complained about his stans for that exact issue,

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:54.000
inflicting this continuous narrative where people stated that they were experiencing harassment from his viewers,

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:57.000
and then Dream would pop up to rub salt in the wound.

01:57:57.000 --> 01:58:00.000
That leads you to the apex in these shenanigans, the speedrunning situation,

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:06.000
one where Dream actively fed propaganda and half-truths to his viewers which caused torture by his own admission,

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:09.000
and when I say half-truths, I don't know whether he knew he cheated or not at the time,

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:14.000
but I do know that he claimed without any basis at all that the motivations of these mods were self-serving,

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:18.000
and had nothing to do with the actual mathematical probabilities that they were arguing,

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:20.000
which he clearly knew were contentious.

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:25.000
If you feed that content to devoted followers, then how do you expect them to react?

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:29.000
You can't be blamed necessarily when people act in a way that doesn't reflect your demeanour as a creator,

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:33.000
but if you're angry, other people are gonna be angry, and then other people are gonna bear the brunt of it.

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:38.000
Dream actively defended his audience, then immediately followed it, unintentionally or not, by using them as a battering ram.

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:41.000
Others then responded angrily, and Dream defended his audience,

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:45.000
while most people see it as Dream pandering to his stans, I also feel there's something personal to it,

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:49.000
because given the fact that Dream has at points caused situations with his own behaviour,

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:54.000
his defence of stans would make sense, because if he didn't then he'd be conceding that his own actions were out of line as well,

01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:59.000
to give preferential treatment was the smartest decision, it's just obviously also a divisive one.

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:03.000
Stans didn't really call Dream out on it, because their perspectives were compromised in a sense,

01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:06.000
and given that they benefit from it, there isn't really much cause to.

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:09.000
Especially on Twitter, stans probably felt like they had been given a hard time,

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:14.000
so many creators had used generalised and vague language to condemn the behaviour of a few,

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:17.000
and even though I'd say the YouTubers were justified in doing so,

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:21.000
I think it always made stans a bit sensitive over their image as obsessive outcasts.

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:27.000
Dream's defence was a breath of fresh air, it was a sign of solidarity, Dream and his stans against the world.

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:32.000
I think solidarity has its risk though, because it becomes an umbrella for all sorts of people,

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:35.000
and I think in a way the toxicity became a self-fulfilling prophecy,

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:38.000
where many used the whole guise of Dream defence to be obnoxious and cruel.

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:43.000
Some who I doubt were even that committed in supporting Dream, but found a space for their own exploits.

01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:47.000
This has led to doxing, harassment, and a variety of other things that are clearly documented,

01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:52.000
not just against Dream's critics, not just against creators in Dream's circle, but Dream himself.

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:57.000
He hasn't exactly benefited from this, but every time the damage becomes clearer, people seem to blame him more.

01:59:57.000 --> 02:00:02.000
This isn't aided by the fact that a lot of his responses are only re-remembered for how he defends himself,

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:04.000
because that's the primary narrative of them.

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:07.000
These groups, it's easier to maintain a culture of silence, because too many times,

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:12.000
people don't want to admit they're flawed given the divisive narrative, but that can be dangerous.

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:15.000
This is coming from me, who I've been knee-deep in terms of Twitter,

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:20.000
and really deep into the community of what most people would say are stans,

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:23.000
and I think that there's very- it's such a small minority.

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:29.000
When you mention a drawing gore or whatever, I've seen two drawings of that that have been mentioned before, ever.

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:33.000
And when you're talking about me with 18 million subscribers and millions of followers on Twitter,

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:37.000
and like you said, tons of interactions and everything, two? Ever? That I've seen?

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:41.000
I'm sure there's probably more, but from what I've seen, two ever,

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:44.000
that's mostly from people posting and saying, oh, look how gross this is, or whatever.

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:47.000
I would assume that that makes- that it's a very small community.

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:51.000
Just look at the private communities that have sprouted, where some partake in truly detestable behaviours.

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:55.000
I don't really want to go into detail, because I've spoken about this stuff enough before,

02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:57.000
and the mainstream communities clearly don't endorse it,

02:00:57.000 --> 02:01:00.000
but people struggle to know exactly what to do about it.

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:02.000
I don't know why, but it feels so good!

02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:08.000
Ninja, let's- let's- let's have that talk.

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:11.000
Hey, hey, hey, hey, call me Ninja!

02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:16.000
Hey, yeah, I feel like I might be a little- a little more peachy than you, Ninja.

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:20.000
You seem to be pushing the boundaries of comedy, Ninja, I'm 16.

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:23.000
Dreamers also may not pan joke or two, which bring rather poor taste,

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:25.000
and these normally wouldn't hold too much weight,

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:29.000
but it's once again that sort of thoughtlessness that can be taken out of context

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:33.000
by legitimately bad actors to validate doing things that are truly awful,

02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:36.000
because they will look for any form of justification possible.

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:39.000
I feel that some people don't want to be too vocal about this stuff

02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:43.000
because they don't want to validate narratives of people who do tie these fringe communities

02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:44.000
to the central Dream Twitter.

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:47.000
Nobody wants to yield ground, and that can have serious implications

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:50.000
when there are nasty, unwanted growths inside your camp.

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:53.000
People can probably do more than they have been doing, to be honest.

02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:57.000
Factions end up arguing over whether these individuals are representative of the community,

02:01:57.000 --> 02:02:00.000
rather than how to get rid of them, it doesn't matter who they represent.

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:02.000
If you want to get rid of them, you're on the same side,

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:06.000
I'd hope that if people work together on bringing that stuff to Twitter's attention,

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:08.000
maybe something more could be done.

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:12.000
However, that's merely a footnote in this belated saga.

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:14.000
What would I say to the big man himself?

02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:22.000
But almost every single thing that I see brought up regarding stans

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:25.000
is just completely false, or very, very out of context.

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:28.000
In my opinion, people who expect Dream to turn on his audience

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:30.000
are probably asking a bit too much,

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:34.000
but I think there is definitely a change in dynamic that would benefit everyone online.

02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:36.000
Dream is obviously against toxic behaviour,

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:38.000
and I think that's completely fair of him,

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:41.000
but I feel it would be even more helpful to just try and lower the stakes

02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:43.000
if he talks shit on such a regular basis,

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:45.000
or just not talk shit at all.

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:48.000
I think people struggle to grapple with the context behind his mindset

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:50.000
when he makes a lot of his comments,

02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:52.000
and when he's called out for it by the right people, he'll backtrack,

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:54.000
but not really explain why he said what he said,

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:56.000
which is clearly an impulsivity problem,

02:02:56.000 --> 02:03:00.000
an assumption that people who don't like what he does have bad intentions,

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:03.000
an impression that he has passed on to his stan community,

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:05.000
which can lead to the strangest of altercations.

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:07.000
There was a rather surreal situation recently

02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:10.000
when stans began to stigmatise a group of British creators

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:12.000
for not wearing masks at a private party,

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:14.000
and then, on top of this, for some reason,

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:18.000
Dream decided to weigh in with likely the most weirdly centrist take of all time,

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:22.000
rambling about viral loads like he knew what the term meant.

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:24.000
Not only was his statement extremely questionable,

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:26.000
but I literally have no clue what his source was

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:31.000
to throw suspicion on the vaccine's ability to influence viral loads.

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:35.000
The studies on this topic are still in a rather early phase

02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:38.000
and certainly don't provide a consensus that supports his claim.

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:42.000
This sort of content is far more dangerous in this environment

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:44.000
than a group of vaccinated and tested friends

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:45.000
who see each other all the time

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:48.000
choosing not to wear masks at a private event.

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:51.000
But then again, Dream's tweet felt like this stretch

02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:54.000
to justify a very strangely targeted reaction

02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:56.000
to people arguably being more responsible

02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:58.000
than a majority of the British population.

02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:00.000
Unless you're willing to write a tweet longer,

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:04.000
going through all the nuances of COVID response, epidemiology and human behaviour,

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:07.000
then maybe it's best just not to say anything.

02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:10.000
One of the greatest problems, particularly with online stan culture,

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:12.000
is this nature to assume.

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:14.000
And I don't think there's anything inherently wrong with assumptions

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:16.000
when you don't know everything.

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:19.000
But you have to work with the fact that you may be ignorant,

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:23.000
rather than being overconfident in details that may not be as one-sided

02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:26.000
as you see them through a picture or a tweet about a picture.

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:30.000
Sometimes Dream just seems too desperate to appease his own audience

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:34.000
while still attempting to be apologetic to those who've received unnecessary backlash

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:37.000
and here it just came across as an absolute mess,

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:40.000
possibly pushing misinformation about a very serious illness

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:42.000
and what we should be doing to combat it.

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:46.000
I'm going to leave some studies here and not say any more.

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:49.000
Thank you for all the congratulations, guys. 25 million. Let's go.

02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:51.000
And you know what? With Dream's monumental growth,

02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:54.000
I can understand how all the attention, both positive and negative,

02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:55.000
must be a bit overwhelming.

02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:57.000
The situations where he's been unfairly stitched up,

02:04:57.000 --> 02:05:00.000
incidents where he's been called out but done very little wrong.

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:03.000
Unfortunately for Dream, some haters are going to come with the territory.

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:07.000
Alongside the success and the stance, it's your job not to provoke that.

02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:11.000
The Sans themselves have shared their fair portion of controversy,

02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:14.000
and with their own consciousness does come a degree of accountability on them.

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:18.000
Throughout most of 2020, I don't think you could say that any YouTuber

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:20.000
was singly responsible for the actions of their Stans.

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:23.000
I think that people just need to lay down clear ground rules

02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:27.000
and a way to actually keep people who don't respect them away from the communities

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:29.000
and sometimes the platform altogether.

02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:31.000
To be fair, many have done that since.

02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:34.000
There are some what people call boundary pages for creators

02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:38.000
and these communities do try to define Stans by people who respect those boundaries.

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:42.000
At the same time, it's still down to creators who foster a close relationship with their Stans

02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:46.000
to make sure there aren't scapegoats to act outside those boundaries.

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:48.000
Dream does deserve the capacity to be himself,

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:51.000
but there are also new responsibilities that come with his position.

02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:54.000
I think anyone with his status would be given the same expectations.

02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:57.000
At the same time, Stans do need to realise that,

02:05:57.000 --> 02:05:59.000
even if he does say the right thing sometimes,

02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:01.000
has his moments of clarity and morality,

02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:06.000
that he is a gamer raised in a gamer country and he may have his gamer moments.

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:08.000
You don't need to take up his cause when he does,

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:10.000
he's large enough to defend himself on many matters

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:14.000
and the inclusion of more parties only complicates a lot of these problems

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:16.000
and it bitters those involved.

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:19.000
Dream erupted onto the scene in a whirlwind of hype and expectation,

02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:22.000
but was clearly confronted with numerous challenges

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:24.000
and corresponding judgement from millions online.

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:27.000
With the internet as it was, many of these people likely did exist

02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:31.000
to drop a hot take on Dream like they knew anything about him and move on.

02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:34.000
Within the fray though, Dream found support from those also under siege,

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:38.000
in his own stand-up, becoming tired at the hip due to that shared persecution complex,

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:41.000
a complex that wasn't completely unfounded.

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:44.000
As a general philosophy though, it was deeply thought,

02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:46.000
because amongst those too harsh on him,

02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:48.000
there was valuable criticism worth listening to

02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:50.000
and clearly evidence behaviour that should have been curbed.

02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:53.000
Generalisations from both sides culminated in this pointless war

02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:58.000
over people's reputations like the matters they were even based on was worth arguing over.

02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:00.000
But sometimes you just need someone to say,

02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:02.000
hey, we should focus on the real enemy here,

02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:05.000
because it's not about if a general group of people are good and bad,

02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:09.000
often it's about ridding ourselves of the bad and retaining the good.

02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:11.000
That's not just the route to community improvement,

02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:13.000
it's the route to personal self-improvement.

02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:16.000
If you look at all the terrible stuff going on in a community and say,

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:20.000
that proves the community is bad, I win, you're not really helping anyone.

02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:23.000
Even if you believe these cultures are inherently toxic,

02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:26.000
you can't deny the fact that there are a lot of people in these communities

02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:28.000
who deserve more help than hate.

02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:31.000
Going forward, I hope Dream is more careful with his words,

02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:33.000
or at least more conscious of how they may affect people.

02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:36.000
Additionally, I think it'd be fair to actually apologise to those he's affected in the past,

02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:38.000
regardless of whether they hate him or not.

02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:40.000
Stan's not your usual fans,

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:43.000
and they can be a bit harder to handle and control as a large creator,

02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:47.000
and Dream can't be expected to own every action of someone who's carried away in their devotion.

02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:50.000
At the same time, if you want to advocate for them and retain them,

02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:53.000
then you do possess some responsibility for what they may do in your name.

02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:57.000
You need to make sure that misconduct is part of the exception rather than the rule,

02:07:57.000 --> 02:08:00.000
and isn't linked to Stan culture at its core, like some have claimed.

02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:03.000
Additionally, even if you disagree with those people,

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:07.000
their opinions are rooted in some experience, so don't go dismissing it too readily.

02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:11.000
I hope that Stan's also realised that support sometimes means being aware

02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:15.000
of how the person you're supporting is fundamentally flawed beyond just their politics,

02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:19.000
and making sure they make responsible decisions for how they conduct themselves.

02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:23.000
If you see too much of yourself in them, then they may be doing something wrong,

02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:25.000
because they're in a very different position to you.

02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:29.000
Stan's could well have a positive influence on Dream and the actions that he takes,

02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:31.000
it's just important to actually identify the problem,

02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:33.000
something that I feel hasn't really been done up until now.

02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:36.000
As much as Dream has misused his power on occasions,

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:38.000
Stan's do possess their own consciousness,

02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:42.000
and they can use that loyalty to make sure that Dream plays fair like the rest of us,

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:45.000
and tones down the behaviour that has instigated these situations.

02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:47.000
Dream is receptive to his own audience,

02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:50.000
and that receptiveness doesn't just have to be limited to social issues.

02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:53.000
However, the standard won't be the only ones within the discourse,

02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:56.000
and I hope other communities can hone in their criticism as well,

02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:58.000
because they have a unique insight to offer,

02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:00.000
and don't just serve to feed the divide.

02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:02.000
It's always easier to listen to someone who's on your side,

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:04.000
even if they should be listening regardless,

02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:07.000
and if you believe in human decency and doing the right thing,

02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:09.000
then you may be more alike than you think.

02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:12.000
As for everyone else, I think we'll have to get used to Dream,

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:14.000
because if one thing's been shown in the last year,

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:18.000
it's that whether by design or fortune, he does have a bit of a staying now.

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:20.000
He's certainly been in less drama in the past few months to say the least,

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:22.000
which is good news,

02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:25.000
but when you have two entities of great influence and volatility,

02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:27.000
the drama is never far away.

02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:30.000
But maybe that's because no one's taking their normal pills anymore.

02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:33.000
Thank you for watching.

02:09:57.000 --> 02:10:01.000
If you enjoyed this video, please like, share, and subscribe,

02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:04.000
and I'll see you in the next video.

02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:31.000
As always, thank you so much for your continued support,

02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:33.000
don't really have too much to add.

02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:36.000
I'd briefly like to thank Surfshark for sponsoring the video,

02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:39.000
I will leave their link in the description below,

02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:41.000
use code OPINION for 83% off.

02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:45.000
This video is also a fundraiser for Macmillan Cancer Support,

02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:47.000
it's a cause very close to my heart,

02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:49.000
donate if you want with what you see fit,

02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:51.000
I'm sure they'll appreciate that.

02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:53.000
Thank you all for sticking with me this year,

02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:55.000
I know that I've been doing this for a long time,

02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:58.000
but hopefully I've provided some content of value.

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:00.000
Thank you again for your support,

02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:02.000
and I'll see you in the next one.

02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:27.000
Thank you.
