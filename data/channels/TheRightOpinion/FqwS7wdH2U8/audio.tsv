0	6000	Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time.
11000	13000	What is this?
24000	26000	Um...
30000	32000	What is this?
36000	38000	What the hell is this?
48000	49000	Uh...
49000	51000	I don't know...
60000	64000	All works. It's getting cancelled on Twitter.
90000	101000	Wow, that's good!
120000	137000	Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time.
137000	140000	And of all the features that are guaranteed to come with internet fame,
140000	143000	few are more certain than the existence of fans and followers.
143000	148000	After all, in many cases, the loyalty of those people is what helped you acquire that status in the first place.
148000	152000	However, as much as fans and their behaviour may exert an influence on you, it's a two-way street,
152000	156000	and the way you present yourself will often define the fanbase you have as well.
156000	161000	This is hardly a groundbreaking discovery, just as every TV show has a target demographic,
161000	165000	every political figure has supporters who likely share many common ideological standpoints,
165000	167000	it's nothing to be alarmed about.
167000	172000	At the same time, one of the most pressing and burdening questions I see asked is how accountable one can be
172000	174000	for the actions of their audience.
174000	177000	First of all, it's challenging enough to manage your own online persona,
177000	179000	let alone that of the masses who view your content.
179000	182000	However, it's definitely become a more pertinent conversation of recent,
182000	185000	typified by the rise of a certain creator called Dream.
185000	189000	You may have heard of him, if not, I'll give you a brief rundown now.
189000	191000	Dream is a Minecraft YouTuber.
191000	195000	He started his channel in 2014, assuming the moniker of Dream Traps,
195000	199000	and although it didn't take him too long to hit 1,000 subs, his channel stagnated after that,
199000	203000	and although he's on record doing a little gaming with his friends and interacting on Twitter,
203000	207000	these few years seemed pretty uneventful by a YouTuber standard.
207000	211000	However, this all changed in 2019, where Minecraft was experiencing a bit of a
211000	214000	renaissance amongst online communities and creators alike.
214000	218000	So this little game called Minecraft is popular again.
218000	221000	Minecraft, I know what everyone's thinking right now.
221000	223000	Everyone's playing Minecraft right now.
223000	227000	However, it was also a refreshed sense of interest, not necessarily based on nostalgia,
227000	233000	and this created a gap for new creators to rise up and fill the increased demand for Minecraft-based content.
233000	238000	Dream was one of those eager creators, and he wasn't just any old chump mooching off its popularity,
238000	241000	he was a seasoned and experienced patron of the game,
241000	243000	and his skills were regularly showcased in the content he produced,
243000	246000	which often revolved around challenges that tested his in-game ability,
246000	249000	as well as his rather popular Minecraft Manhunt series.
249000	252000	Although he wasn't regarded as a force of personality,
252000	255000	his proficiency with the game at hand was highly admirable,
255000	258000	and as more people tuned in, his channel picked up momentum,
258000	261000	though I'm not sure anyone could have predicted where he would be today.
265000	270000	You see, in the space of two years, he went from 1000 subscribers or so to over 20 million,
270000	273000	which I think is what some would call blowing up.
273000	277000	He streams with a crew known as the Dream Team, which includes old and new friends alike.
277000	281000	He uploads on a semi-regular basis, and has very successful side-hustles.
281000	284000	It would be fair to take a glance at his channel and say he's doing alright for himself,
284000	286000	but is this the full story?
286000	291000	Such a great amount of success in such a short amount of time is certainly a lot to adjust to,
291000	294000	alongside the increased sense of influence and responsibility you hold.
294000	297000	However, it's nothing that creators aren't used to, is it?
309000	312000	Well, I want to introduce a new feature of YouTube stardom,
312000	315000	that being what many regard as stan culture.
315000	319000	Many of you probably wonder what the basics are surrounding this.
319000	323000	The term is derived from the infamous Eminem song stan, short for stalker fan,
323000	328000	the one about an obsessed fan who goes postal when Marshall doesn't immediately return the affection
328000	330000	that the title character bestows onto the rapper.
330000	334000	It's a pretty great, but also deeply uncomfortable portrayal of fan-idle relationships,
334000	339000	and a stark reminder of how obsession and attachment can manifest themselves in very ugly ways.
339000	343000	Nowadays, however, it doesn't seem to quite carry the grave implications,
343000	347000	but still refers to those who may be slightly overzealous in their support for popular figures.
347000	351000	Twitter has been fertile grounds for such a culture to manifest itself,
351000	356000	often following renowned celebrities such as Ariana Grande, Nicki Minaj, and of course the K-pop genre,
356000	362000	most notably the household name BTS, who have definitely spawned some of the most passionate devotees.
362000	364000	I can see the gifts now.
364000	368000	This can be quite controversial, and there have been a considerable number of situations
368000	372000	which have involved celebrities distancing themselves from the social media platform
372000	374000	due to antics attributed to these communities.
374000	378000	With that said, there hasn't been too much direct involvement from the targets of their affection,
378000	380000	as is the case with most celebrities.
380000	383000	They make the music, the media appearances, they do their job,
383000	387000	but they don't tend to be outspoken on issues like this unless they view it as absolutely essential.
387000	390000	PR is a tightrope, and most walk it without swaying.
390000	395000	However, as I've said many times before, YouTubers tend to have a more intimate relationship with their audience,
395000	401000	they tend to be more interactive, and the online platform makes them feel at least a bit closer to us than the traditional personage.
401000	403000	So what happens when you put the two together?
403000	406000	Well, that's the question that rid itself with our friend Dream here.
406000	410000	But why? Stands have been around forever, even before we had a name for them,
410000	413000	there have been communities set up to champion other creators.
413000	416000	I should note, I've been to a James Merrick meet and greet.
416000	420000	Yet as Dream's viewership continued to balloon, his stand-in grew respectively,
420000	424000	eventually procuring a consciousness of its own, and even a little title,
424000	427000	the deity twit, I don't know exactly how to pronounce that,
427000	433000	but one which, to say the least, was certainly quite ardent in its support of the newfangled internet sensation.
433000	437000	To be honest, it was quite unique how invested many people seem to be, but it's pretty harmless.
437000	444000	In fact, most of the time, being part of a community like that merely constitutes of lending your undivided support to a creator and their ventures,
444000	447000	and if you want to go and support someone in such a way, then I don't think anyone should obstruct that,
447000	453000	and to be honest, if a creator is more involved with their audience, that can regularly be quite a positive and rewarding experience.
453000	459000	There's one caveat though, and that's YouTube drama, an omnipresent facet of this delightful sight.
459000	463000	Someone of Dream's status with the level of influence he had, with his astronomical rise to fame,
463000	468000	was going to be subject to significant levels of pressure, and dare I say it, controversy,
468000	471000	whether he was an outwardly tendentious figure or not.
471000	478000	Devoted stans, a large YouTuber, an internet drama, I mean, what could possibly happen?
479000	486000	Well, let's find out. Ladies, gentlemen, everyone, I suggest we begin. Insert Dream becoming nightmare punchline here.
500000	504000	How one interacts with their fans, in general, is a philosophy personal to that creator,
504000	509000	and plenty of YouTubers have different ways of approaching it. Some are very involved in the communities that surround them,
509000	513000	others prefer to maintain a degree of separation. Like everything, there's a popular spectrum,
513000	518000	you don't want to be too far away from your audience to the point where you don't really understand what they want or what they expect of you,
518000	523000	at the same time, you don't want to be too close to them to the point that you foster toxic parasocial relationships.
523000	527000	When you think of Minecraft, and you think of the average Minecraft enjoyer,
527000	532000	many likely imagine the kid with a creeper t-shirt and a diamond pickaxe toy that isn't even made of diamond,
532000	538000	and to be honest, it wouldn't surprise me if a majority of Dream's YouTube following was at least somewhat comprised of that demographic.
538000	544000	However, go on Twitter and you'll see quite a contrasting portrait, and certainly not that stereotypically associated with Minecraft.
544000	549000	One thing I mentioned at the start when talking about a fanbase is that it is often influenced by the creator themselves,
549000	558000	however, stans don't necessarily play by the same rules. Now, of course, I don't doubt that many do hold a legitimate interest in the genre that Dream finds himself in.
558000	566000	However, stans are often characterised online more by their pattern of their behaviour towards the creator rather than their specific interest in the content itself.
566000	573000	These will often involve tweets, threads, fancams, edits, fanfictions, all that jazz which reclaims their love for the creator in question.
573000	577000	A lot of stans, particularly ones in online communities, are also known for their social sensitivity.
577000	583000	Now, this isn't a casual statement as I've had friends who've been subject to the surprising amounts of, insert phobic here,
583000	591000	harassment when even saying the slightest criticism against a kpop group, but generally speaking, online stans are more committed to social causes than the average fanbase.
591000	597000	They also have a stronger sense of community and identity, and are a bit more robust in where they stand ideologically.
597000	601000	Minecraft, on the other hand, has been traditionally associated with your stereotypical gamer,
604000	610000	many of whom are not particularly political at all, and others who certainly possess somewhat questionable ideas.
610000	613000	You're probably all aware of Minecraft creator Notch's takes by now.
613000	619000	It's an interesting intersection, and probably part of the reason that stans have never really been traditionally associated with that genre.
619000	622000	Now, this doesn't mean the creators they had followed didn't dabble in Minecraft,
622000	627000	that was probably what switched many of the stan community onto Minecraft creators in the first place,
627000	630000	but Dream was a distilled MC gamer, and a pretty decent one at that.
630000	636000	With that said, a stans elevator commitment to a creator regardless of genre makes them pretty versatile in who they can support,
636000	640000	and they had chosen their king, but let's talk about that said king in person.
666000	677000	As said, he's a very skilled Minecraft player, and he was never an outwardly unpleasant person,
677000	683000	he wasn't overtly bigoted, and although we'll discuss some curious takes in due course, there was no obvious reason to hate him.
683000	688000	However, he also wasn't the most diplomatic person, and he definitely had a very competitive streak to him,
688000	692000	with a dashing assault on the side. Now, I don't think his attitude was particularly exceptional,
692000	695000	as a matter of fact, I think him and I are quite similar in that regard,
695000	698000	but the difference is, in spite of the fact that I am a massive gamer,
701000	707000	I don't ground my persona in playing online games, nor do I think I have an audience who would take my in-game passion particularly seriously,
707000	710000	because you really shouldn't.
710000	714000	Stans on the other hand, can be very serious, and there are a plethora of reasons for this,
714000	718000	partly because of who they are, they may be young, they may re-tone differently,
718000	721000	or they may just want to show their commitment to their beloved creator.
721000	725000	There are people in an array of fandoms who vie for the approval of their heroes,
725000	729000	to even receive moments of recognition for their devotion to that icon.
729000	734000	That leads people to actions that may not necessarily be viewed as healthy or productive to the world around them,
734000	737000	or other people in pursuit of a Twitter reply.
737000	743000	Plenty of studies published have documented traits exhibited by those who engage in celebrity worship of any kind.
743000	746000	On one hand, you'll have people who are a bit more connected to reality,
746000	750000	on the other, you'll have people who believe that if these celebrities saw them in a restaurant,
750000	754000	they'd come and sit down for a chat. Many want to believe that.
754000	758000	Now as noted, celebrities often have limited scope in acknowledging public support,
758000	761000	rather than a few generalised statements about how much they love you guys.
761000	764000	I discussed that spectrum which many YouTubers occupy,
764000	769000	and although some certainly express affection for their devotees, many still maintain a professional distance.
769000	774000	Dream wasn't of that persuasion, he'd always conveyed gratitude to those he felt responsible for his success,
774000	777000	and that definitely encompassed many within the stan community.
777000	783000	He was also just extremely active and interactive on Twitter, which enabled plenty of positive exchanges with his supporters.
783000	787000	He'd engage with them, make them feel valued, wanted part of a greater movement,
787000	790000	and for the earlier part, his time in the spotlight was quite blissful.
793000	797000	Dream's relationship with his audience was tight-knit, and for every positive interaction they had,
797000	801000	he gave people more reasons to support him, he made it a rewarding experience.
801000	804000	To the average fan, there were a lot of perceptible benefits to stanning Dream.
804000	809000	Pair this with the natural yet impressive growth of this channel, and it seemed like a recipe for mutual success was brewing.
809000	813000	However, it's a two-sided coin, because although Dream was hot shit and he kinda knew he was,
813000	818000	the problem is that when that's undermined or challenged, it can regularly cause an emotional response.
818000	823000	Now that emotional response from someone like Dream wouldn't inherently have any repercussions,
823000	825000	in fact amongst friends, it can often be laughed off.
825000	828000	The problem is that when you involve people who don't have that context,
828000	831000	nor that necessary understanding of how to handle situations,
831000	838000	a ripple effect occurs where any sort of negativity is amplified because those more devoted want their commitment to go unparalleled,
838000	842000	especially when dealing with drama, but so far we haven't really had any of that.
842000	844000	Let's introduce it then.
850000	853000	There has always been discourse over the healthiness of stan mentality,
853000	856000	but it's never been particularly targeted, and if you want to go back to his early prosperity,
856000	860000	many wouldn't even pay mind to this, but his excitement for Dream reached fever pitch,
860000	864000	this often spilled onto other creators and communities who were not the most enthusiastic about it.
864000	867000	The problem is that it's not just Dream that's closer to the communities,
867000	871000	it's all of Dream's friends, collaborators, associates, anyone he interacts with at all,
871000	874000	even people just in the outer fringes of the genre.
874000	879000	Unlike many normal human beings, not all of Dream's online exchanges were as wholesome as one may idealise,
879000	884000	and as it persists, people begin to notice, and equate a lot of the worst antics to Dream and his fanbase.
884000	890000	This began to emerge at the end of summer 2020, when there was a flurry of incidents attributed to Dream stans,
890000	893000	particularly relating to other creators, and how they often mixed with each other.
893000	899000	This pattern of behaviour that they were often associated with wasn't met warmly by YouTubers or their respective communities.
899000	903000	Now when you're dealing with stans with certain celebrities, I'd argue that they have the capacity to behave
903000	907000	with a lot more toxicity than Dream's audience ever did, especially towards other artists,
907000	913000	but once again, that disconnect often distances both parties from possible consequences such toxicity may yield.
913000	918000	This is not the same with YouTubers, and Twitch streamers who often invested heavily in their platforms,
918000	921000	and are much more likely to use them to voice their opinion.
921000	924000	They've got arrows, so they're shooting.
924000	927000	This is not a dead end, you're fine.
931000	934000	Oh, Technoblade!
935000	940000	You fools! You fools! You messed with the wrong man!
940000	945000	He's a YouTuber called Technoblade. He is known to collaborate with Dream, having what many describe as a friendly rivalry,
945000	950000	emphasis on the friendly. Towards the back end of August, he competed in a duel against our Minecraft overlord here,
951000	957000	it was hosted by our good friend MrBeast, and in typical beastly fashion, the winner would take home $100,000,
957000	962000	and the title of best Minecraft player, a very objective denomination if I say so myself.
962000	967000	Three hearts! No! Oh no! Dream down! No! Dream!
967000	974000	Okay, the tides are turning, the tides are- No! What? No way! No way! No!
974000	976000	No! My goodness!
977000	983000	Bro, no way! Oh no! Technoblade, you animal!
983000	989000	In what was seen by some as a bit of an upset, Technoblade had the audacity to defeat Daddy Dream,
989000	995000	and with his pride somewhat dented at that point in time, Dr. Eamon passed a few off-hand comments during his post-mortem.
995000	999000	He ran and was just running around the rock in a circle, and I literally just couldn't do anything.
999000	1005000	He was just running around in a circle until he healed, and then we fought again and he beat me by one heart.
1007000	1014000	I think he said it too, but depending on the day, it could have gone either way.
1014000	1020000	It just depends on the day, how they do. They get the lucky rod, the lucky bowshot, the lucky combo, whatever.
1022000	1025000	He won, and I think that's amazing.
1026000	1032000	I'm impressed, I'm impressed with Techno. I think 1.16, he impressed me, and 1.8, he impressed me.
1032000	1036000	I fought a bunch of insane 1.8 players on 1.14, and just never lost to them.
1036000	1041000	And then they're sitting there like, wow, 1.16 is insane.
1041000	1046000	So I think people don't realise how impressive it is that Techno won against me.
1046000	1050000	In a similar vein, many of Dream's more ardent viewers sprung to the defence of their liege,
1050000	1054000	with many proclaiming their annoyance and disappointment, with a few going to more extreme lengths,
1054000	1057000	providing ample fuel for a variety of compilation videos.
1057000	1061000	Techno never commented on this himself, splitting the money with Dream as part of their pre-Duel agreement,
1061000	1064000	hopefully also signalling the absence of any bad blood.
1064000	1068000	Nonetheless, it provoked discourse within the Reddit and Twitter communities in particular,
1068000	1071000	with some expressing frustration at Dream's own behaviour,
1071000	1074000	and questioning how his own attitude could influence that of his audience.
1074000	1078000	A few more clips then also began circulating about other creators who'd had their own run-ins,
1078000	1081000	with the more passionate factions of Dream's followers.
1081000	1087000	I didn't know anybody there, I only knew Crenios and I guess Dream through association.
1087000	1089000	That's healthy.
1089000	1090000	Did you say who?
1090000	1093000	So I looked at one of their channels and none of them liked me.
1093000	1096000	None of them liked me because I killed Dream one time.
1096000	1098000	I know that feel, I know that feel, Connor.
1098000	1100000	I know that feeling too.
1100000	1102000	So I was like, man, I'd rather not go to bed.
1102000	1103000	Did people get angry?
1103000	1106000	This in turn led to some questioning Dream's own failure to moderate his own fanbase,
1106000	1109000	with some even proposing that they be disciplined,
1109000	1111000	though I'm not sure how that would be enforced.
1111000	1114000	However, it seems these pleas mostly fell on deaf ears at the time,
1114000	1117000	as many reported in the next few days that creators, including Dream,
1117000	1119000	had their names published and shared online,
1119000	1121000	and one guy by the name of Tubbo, a 16-year-old creator,
1121000	1125000	who'd received death threats after making a statement in-stream about ACAP,
1125000	1127000	that being All Cops Are Bastards.
1127000	1129000	What does that even mean?
1129000	1132000	So it's basically about all cops are bad?
1132000	1133000	No, all cops are bastards.
1133000	1135000	That's just not true.
1140000	1141000	Yeah?
1141000	1143000	What are you doing?
1143000	1144000	Where you going?
1144000	1146000	Oh, yeah, no, don't say that, Tubbo.
1146000	1150000	I think it's more, I don't think it means the individual cops,
1150000	1153000	I think it more is referring to the idea of the police state,
1153000	1157000	and how, like, the idea of police.
1157000	1160000	You shouldn't say that if you don't know enough about it, Tubbo.
1160000	1161000	Oh.
1161000	1162000	It's fine, it's fine.
1162000	1163000	I mean, in the UK, they're great.
1163000	1166000	Now, it's important to note that these debates were also internal,
1166000	1169000	and many stans were concerned about these issues as well,
1169000	1173000	but the problem was that discourse never really resulted in any proper change,
1173000	1176000	because there were plenty of people ready to deny, or at least downplay this,
1176000	1181000	and the problem with that toxic minority is that they're often the most influential ambassadors of a community,
1181000	1185000	because they are louder, hence why they are referred to as the vocal minority,
1185000	1187000	and as people have negative experiences with them,
1187000	1190000	they then create a mental image in their head of what this community is like,
1190000	1192000	whether that image is accurate or not,
1192000	1195000	then that begins to spread and manifest into something new,
1195000	1198000	and what was formerly this wholesome movement begins to contort itself,
1198000	1202000	and you really need someone like Dream, the figurehead of this, to speak to common sense.
1202000	1203000	Did he though?
1203000	1205000	Dream is quite active on his reddit,
1205000	1209000	and did actually respond to some who he believed were interpreting his actions somewhat uncharitably,
1209000	1214000	clarifying that he was merely taking an analytical stance on the situation rather than trying to make excuses.
1214000	1216000	This is a fair response,
1216000	1219000	at the end of the day, I'm sure both players in the duel had the capacity to win,
1219000	1224000	and whether he was assigning too much responsibility onto circumstance over ability is besides the point.
1224000	1227000	I don't think he was unreasonable, whether you agree with him or not,
1227000	1232000	he also placed his continued commitment to discouraging malefactions from users within his community,
1232000	1234000	referring to a stream where he did indeed mention it.
1234000	1237000	Dream- I'd like, probably my, I don't want to say my community is more toxic,
1237000	1239000	but I think my community probably is more toxic.
1239000	1244000	Dream- Ooh, why don't you stick the knife in a harder and twisted Dream?
1244000	1250000	Dream- But I wouldn't want, I think that if I had won, people, I mean Techno would have never heard the end of it,
1250000	1253000	and I think, if he won, I think-
1253000	1257000	Dream- Aw, that's such a nice thought, okay, I see what you're saying.
1257000	1259000	Techno- That's why I said I think it's part of the problem.
1259000	1262000	Admittedly, an aside on a stream isn't exactly the most potent statement,
1262000	1265000	in fact it was more like an acknowledgement rather than a request to his viewers,
1265000	1268000	but you can't expect him to make a tweet and video every five minutes.
1268000	1272000	In Dream's position, he wouldn't necessarily want to make a big deal out of it anyway,
1272000	1274000	because it would probably just yield more conflict,
1274000	1277000	and at this point, it wasn't worth the drama.
1277000	1279000	However, it should have been a warning worth heeding,
1279000	1283000	if Dream was leaving all those disclaimers as he said he was, and nothing was happening,
1283000	1287000	it was a sign that it was going to take a bit more to suppress the action of his supposed fans.
1287000	1292000	Additionally, his Reddit response didn't really answer the comparisons being drawn to other creators
1292000	1295000	who had seemingly been more proactive in preventing toxic behaviour.
1295000	1299000	At the least, if he had made a more official statement, it would have been a benchmark for his stance,
1299000	1302000	and he could have disowned any abuse towards those in his circle.
1302000	1307000	It's clear that people weren't listening enough, because it wasn't even just public figures facing down the brunt of the toxicity.
1307000	1310000	Barely a week after the Tetner debacle, Dream sent a sassy reply to someone,
1310000	1313000	and then another person believed to be a Stan claimed to have their docs.
1313000	1320000	Although Dream later clarified he was joking, and so did the mystery Stan, it was once again a little too late.
1320000	1325000	It should have been presumed that Dream was against the behaviour that some Stans had enacted, even against himself,
1325000	1331000	and yet the question continued to loom and mutate, only furthering the tension between critics and fans.
1331000	1335000	But why? Well, I'll do my best to explain.
1337000	1341000	I have to say, I've been left in a bit of a conflicted state by this point.
1341000	1345000	There was definitely a lot of questionable behaviour being carried out, but I wasn't sure who the perpetrators were.
1345000	1348000	It's very easy to immediately point your fingers at these Stans,
1348000	1351000	but a large majority of tweets on the matter were people condemning these actions,
1351000	1356000	and even the toxicity in YouTube comment sections could not necessarily be tied back to people directly within these communities.
1356000	1360000	Just because someone was a fan of Dream didn't mean they were a part of the Twitter Stan community,
1360000	1363000	however, that comparison was continuously drawn.
1363000	1367000	For example, another creator by the name of Bolfie posted a screenshot of his comment section,
1367000	1370000	and many people who asserted that he was practically discount Dream,
1370000	1376000	assuming because of the crudely drawn smiley face, which as we all know, represents Dream and nothing else.
1376000	1380000	Once again, these comments were really dumb, but were they all made by Stans,
1380000	1383000	or just pickle viewers who may also watch Dream?
1383000	1387000	It's hard to say, and although you can't easily tie YouTube accounts to their respective Twitter handles,
1387000	1391000	that assumption that all these people making ill-educated comments are immediately Stans
1391000	1397000	when they possess an equally elementary understanding of the creator in question seems to disregard the system of due protest.
1397000	1401000	However, I guess when there are issues as inconsequential as the ones discussed so far,
1401000	1404000	it's very easy to judge situations somewhat haphazardly.
1404000	1408000	Nonetheless, the problem is that a lot of small instances can often snowball,
1408000	1411000	particularly when people receive impressions of a fanbase from those instances,
1411000	1415000	and it wasn't long until the caricature of the zealous Dream Stan began to spread.
1415000	1420000	I think this was because many people drew parallels between comments that seemed obsessed with associating everything with Dream
1420000	1425000	to those obsessed with Dream, the Stans, but at this point I'd say it was more hypothetical than proven.
1425000	1431000	This had two outcomes though, firstly it made people in neighbouring and adjacent communities more hostile to Dream and his Stans,
1431000	1434000	and it made the Dream Stans themselves more defensive,
1434000	1437000	and although Dream had proudly proclaimed that he dissuaded toxicity,
1437000	1441000	he would regularly jump at the opportunity to come to the aid of his Stans.
1441000	1445000	This statement from September, barely a month after the Techno situation,
1445000	1451000	asserted that 90% of the time, the people who complained just hated him, or were blowing a non-existent problem out of proportion,
1451000	1455000	and given what we discussed, it's understandable why people were being a bit more defensive,
1455000	1462000	at the same time, the problem was, this focus on beating this narrative often then ignores the fact that there may be an actual problem,
1462000	1466000	and it was gradually emerging. In fact, a few days after this tweet, another creator,
1466000	1470000	Wilbur Soot, who had replied to Dream's statement after being called out from the replies,
1470000	1474000	would stop streaming prematurely due to purported toxicity in his chat.
1474000	1478000	I wanna say, I wanna say chat, you're saying that I wouldn't have died if I picked yellow,
1478000	1481000	I just wanted to be yellow, why can't Tubbo let me-
1481000	1484000	I explained that to him and he kept shouting at me, so I just stood my ground.
1484000	1485000	Nothing.
1485000	1487000	It's not his fucking colour!
1487000	1490000	I'll give him the colour if he wants next time, but Jesus.
1490000	1491000	I want it!
1491000	1494000	It feels like we're just- it doesn't feel like a proper game-
1494000	1498000	I don't know, I like to, I like to mess around with Among Us,
1498000	1500000	I mean you saw at the beginning of the game I kicked Fundy for fun,
1500000	1502000	but like this feels too much.
1502000	1505000	What is this chat? What are you doing right now, man?
1505000	1508000	This is- no, it's not hi, YouTube, chat.
1508000	1512000	He's a child, you've gotta give him the colour, give him the yellow.
1512000	1513000	It's fine.
1513000	1515000	I'm just gonna end.
1515000	1519000	In this case, this was as edgy because Wilbur wouldn't give Tubbo another creator,
1519000	1521000	his colour in Among Us.
1521000	1524000	I can't say whether this was the case or not, but as long as people perceived it that way,
1524000	1528000	then friction between communities and creators would continue to rise.
1528000	1533000	And yes, you can't ignore the fact that 90% allows for 10% of legitimate complaints,
1533000	1537000	it's not an absolute statement, at the same time, it's still a narrative against the critics
1537000	1540000	as long as he doesn't give credence to that 10%,
1540000	1543000	which you can barely squeeze beyond a brief acknowledgement in the reply.
1543000	1549000	However, 10% of a large number is still a large number, or a significant one at least.
1549000	1553000	For example, Wilbur, he had no reason to hate Stans, and he clearly doesn't,
1553000	1558000	he merely had some negative experiences, but some used this statement to challenge him as well.
1558000	1562000	It seemed to deepen this rift between those who resented Dream and those who supported him,
1562000	1565000	because the former once again felt that he was dismissing the concerns,
1565000	1569000	and those who supported him felt validated in their sentiments of unjust persecution.
1569000	1572000	The term antis also began garnering popularity around this time,
1572000	1577000	which was basically the slang way to describe people who criticised Dream and the community around him.
1577000	1581000	I've never been particularly fond of such terms because they often serve as a way to dismiss large groups of people,
1581000	1584000	even if some of them have valid observations to make.
1584000	1589000	Eve Dodgen felt like it was becoming an us vs them situation, with Dream stoking the fire,
1589000	1594000	and many would argue that it didn't stop there, with Dream exposing many to the wrath of his own audience.
1594000	1597000	Why would he do this though, when it wasn't even his intent in the first place?
1597000	1601000	Well, normally people's behaviour can be viewed through quite a simple lens,
1601000	1605000	that being that one is typically responsible for their own actions, and not someone else's.
1605000	1609000	However, being a public figure is quite different, because many assume you are responsible,
1609000	1612000	at least in part, for not riling up your audience unnecessarily.
1612000	1616000	Hell, there are even laws in many countries regarding how you speak to the public,
1616000	1618000	because we are aware when inflammatory language is espoused,
1618000	1623000	it has the capability to instigate unprovoked harm against innocent parties.
1623000	1625000	This is a rule common to creators as well,
1625000	1628000	you have an audience that is responsive to what you say on a public platform,
1628000	1631000	and when being responsible for how some of those around you may act,
1631000	1634000	you are expected to exercise a degree of self-restraint,
1634000	1637000	and as said, Dream did, but many would ask if it was enough.
1637000	1640000	One of the greater issues with Stands is that they are loyal to a fault,
1640000	1645000	and if many of them see their idol under duress, their instinct is to jump to that creator's defence.
1645000	1649000	On the other hand, if they see a creator calling someone out, they will echo that sentiment,
1649000	1650000	maybe even more assertively.
1650000	1656000	This often isn't a problem, most creators end up in quarrels which then involve followers who are keen to voice their opinion.
1656000	1660000	It's inevitable with the internet, and provided you're not intentionally misrepresenting the other party,
1660000	1662000	it will have a limited impact long term.
1662000	1664000	People are impulsive, people are emotional,
1664000	1669000	they should be allowed to express themselves online whether they have 20 million subscribers or not.
1669000	1671000	But the question is, to what degree?
1671000	1674000	Well, let's assess the impact first.
1679000	1683000	Dream did have his tendencies to be a bit more outspoken than the average Minecraft creator.
1683000	1689000	The strange paradox is that some of the most vocal people in their content are often some of the most careful on social media.
1689000	1691000	Dream was certainly cautious on what he said,
1691000	1695000	partly because of the fact that he had been called out for previously ill-advised opinions,
1695000	1699000	but he was also quite forthright when he felt strongly about his situation,
1699000	1702000	and as you'll see, strong feelings are risky business.
1702000	1704000	Let's move into September and October then,
1704000	1706000	and in and out of interacting with his viewers,
1706000	1710000	our dear Dream decided to hold a giveaway for a Minecraft gift code with his friend,
1710000	1713000	and co-founder of Dream SMP, GeorgeNotFound.
1713000	1716000	George tweeted this code out, excluding the final character.
1716000	1720000	Viewers were then left scrambling to decide which letter or number occupied that gap.
1720000	1724000	However, another creator by the name of Colin Smoke, who was assumed to be on good terms with the Dream team,
1724000	1726000	proclaimed that he had succeeded on the first attempt,
1726000	1729000	before tweeting shortly after that he was hosting a giveaway of his own.
1729000	1732000	All you had to do was retweet and follow him.
1732000	1737000	Dream, however, responded, accusing Colin of ransacking a fan giveaway and using it for clout,
1737000	1741000	though the XD may imply that he at least sees the amusing side of it,
1741000	1744000	though I feel it may have been tinged with a dashing of sarcasm.
1744000	1748000	In a shocking twist though, Colin reveals that he didn't actually acquire the code first time,
1748000	1751000	and this was all in fact a genius ruse by our mastermind jokester.
1751000	1755000	Additionally, Colin would be holding a legitimate giveaway of his own,
1755000	1757000	so it should be considered a net positive.
1757000	1759000	Unfortunately, Dream didn't see the funny side of this,
1759000	1765000	expressing his discomfort towards a tweet engineered for exposure on the basis of a giveaway where that element wasn't present.
1765000	1769000	Colin then responds with the extremely eloquent, no you argument,
1769000	1773000	and strikes a nerve with our Minecraft virtuoso, who proceeds to scold his former associate,
1773000	1776000	telling him that he has been disrespectful in public and private,
1776000	1779000	an abundance of times, and will be subsequently blocked.
1779000	1784000	On top of this, he suggests that Colin uses his charity work as a vehicle to orchestrate sympathy from those around him,
1784000	1787000	prompting questions about the creator's character.
1787000	1792000	I'll add that this wasn't really aided by the fact that one of Dream's colleagues, Sapnap, had blocked Colin a few days prior.
1792000	1795000	This elicited a variety of reactions from audience members,
1795000	1799000	as well as Colin, who thought that up to a point that their exchange had been in jest,
1799000	1803000	I must say I personally find that surprising, especially with Dream's follow-up reply,
1803000	1805000	which I struggle to find the humour in.
1805000	1809000	As Dream's rather confrontational nature was certainly met with different reactions from those within fandoms,
1809000	1813000	Colin was one of the first to say that he had been subjected to the wrath of Dream Twitter.
1813000	1816000	Some were sceptical towards this though, and believed he was playing victim.
1816000	1819000	Now there was no public sign of mass hate towards Colin.
1819000	1825000	At the same time, it's often hard given how certain more toxic factions of these communities operate, often incognito.
1825000	1830000	We all know how some have responded to even trivial disagreements within the Minecraft community.
1830000	1836000	With Dream aggressively calling someone out, it's hard to rule out the possibility that Colin was exposed to some real nastiness,
1836000	1839000	though he did seem to walk back on these words a couple months later,
1839000	1842000	so it's hard to know exactly how he felt about the situation.
1842000	1847000	Nonetheless, the large majority of Twitter stans seem to be of the belief that this would have been better sold than DMs,
1847000	1853000	in part because it would have prevented hostility, but also because it would have prevented a very limited and aggressive perspective
1853000	1859000	being presented to audience members who really didn't have enough context to understand why Dream felt the way he did.
1859000	1865000	Strictly speaking, this was a matter for Dream and Colin to resolve amongst themselves, even if it did conclude in Dream blocking Colin.
1865000	1869000	I didn't really find Dream's arguments particularly compelling without further context either.
1869000	1876000	Colin had already established that he was holding various charity events that month, so it was hard to see it as a spontaneous attempt to defend himself.
1876000	1881000	Dream just seemed rather irate in the moment, and that's okay, people are angry sometimes.
1881000	1885000	The problem is, when you have a fanbase capable of self-acknowledged toxicity,
1885000	1892000	how many times can you direct your anger towards a person or a group of people without also motivating the possibility of harassment and hate,
1892000	1897000	even if you discourage it yourself? What level of responsibility does your innate humanity hold?
1897000	1902000	To what point should you police yourself? How should you use that influence when you have fans that devoted?
1902000	1910000	This question would be posed again barely a day after, at an event known as Minecon Live, an annual convention which, unsurprisingly, concerns Minecraft.
1910000	1914000	However, due to the then present health concerns, it was being held as an interactive event.
1914000	1921000	There are a variety of in-game related activities at these ceremonies, and one of the great interests to a lot of the fans this year was the announcement of a new mob.
1921000	1927000	However, with three options available, it was decided that a poll would be conducted to see what the populace desired.
1927000	1932000	Given that it was all online, they decided that the best platform for this poll was Twitter, which also made sense.
1932000	1936000	The three options presented were Glowswood, Iceologer, and Moonloom.
1936000	1943000	Now, everyone had their preference, I probably would have gone Iceologer myself, my friend suggested it should have been called Chillager,
1943000	1948000	but Dream had his heart set on the Glow Squid, he even decided to vocally advocate for the voting of the Glow Squid.
1948000	1953000	Now once again, on its own, this isn't a huge issue, people back horses during races,
1953000	1958000	but Dream had an extremely large fanbase, some of whom would just go for what he said for the sake of it.
1958000	1964000	Furthermore, Dream then said he would begin following people who showed him evidence that they voted for the Glow Squid as well,
1964000	1967000	essentially bribing his audience to vote for his choice.
1967000	1973000	Lo and behold, many of his audience did, with the Glow Squid winning both the first round and the subsequent runoff.
1973000	1977000	However, the margin by which this creature won its votes was, to be frank, marginal,
1977000	1984000	and this led many to conclude that Iceologer would have won had it not been for Dream's rather enthusiastic endorsement of its adversary.
1984000	1988000	This annoyed a decent amount of people at the time who accused Dream of rigging the vote in its favour,
1988000	1994000	it was hard to deny it really with the evidence available, but he's a person, he can state whatever preferences he has,
1994000	2000000	and encourage people by whatever means, it happens every year in elections, he clearly thought of it that way as well,
2000000	2004000	and initially just mean the fact that he had affected the outcome of the Minecraft poll,
2004000	2010000	but other people weren't thrilled, and it's not hard to see why either, why even vote if your vote doesn't matter.
2010000	2014000	A couple days later, Dream released a more comprehensive thread, explaining his motives,
2014000	2020000	but also denying this idea that he'd induced excessive influence on the outcome of a vote, which was certainly debatable.
2020000	2024000	Further to this though, he stated that in fact he didn't really care which mob was added,
2024000	2028000	and certainly not about a dumb squid, which I'm not sure was the best response,
2028000	2032000	it was concluded with the caveat that he actually did think it was the best choice,
2032000	2038000	but once again, Dream sent mixed signals which clearly didn't satisfy those who had felt he had more responsibility to own up to,
2038000	2040000	and they were going to make this known.
2040000	2052000	Here's the problem, and it shouldn't be too difficult to explain,
2052000	2057000	if one person can influence the outcome of a poll, then it can no longer really be considered a poll.
2057000	2062000	People are more than welcome to express their opinions and preferences, but we should still encourage people to vote for what they want,
2062000	2067000	and Dream's involvement changed the outcome on the basis of his involvement alone, and very little else.
2067000	2072000	And it's hard to go Mr Minecraft over here too much for this, because everyone was offering their input and influence as well,
2072000	2077000	but I think it just reached a stage of disproportionality where basically anything went if Dream said so,
2077000	2081000	you still want that illusion of democracy at least, and Dream couldn't meme his way out of this one.
2081000	2086000	It was worse when he claimed that he didn't even care, because regardless of how irrelevant the vote was to him or his followers,
2086000	2091000	it was clearly meaningful to a lot of users, and some felt a bit robbed of their freedom of choice.
2091000	2096000	People still want their voice to be heard, even if it is on the vote of a mostly inconsequential in-game addition to Minecraft,
2096000	2102000	it's also hard to buy Dream's whole response that he didn't actually care, he made arguments against the Isolager,
2102000	2108000	and in favour of the Glow Squid, not really the ones a person who doesn't care would make, he clearly had a preference.
2108000	2115000	I think one of the greatest issues with influencers and their use of stands is that it will often bypass the process of critical thinking.
2115000	2122000	Now, young people online aren't going to be highest tier intellectuals, at the same time, you still want to encourage someone to think for themselves,
2122000	2131000	rather than necessarily just adopting another person's opinion because they tell them to, particularly if they then implement that opinion in a way that can affect real world outcomes.
2131000	2138000	Now, as said, this ideal isn't really possible a lot of the time, YouTubers expressing the most trivial opinions will affect their audiences,
2138000	2144000	but it's important to make sure you don't necessarily exploit that concept, and in many critics eyes, Dream crossed a line.
2144000	2148000	Following this situation, Dream went through a process of seemingly coming to terms with his influence,
2148000	2153000	a week after the aforementioned threads, released an even more comprehensive Twitlonger which addressed a variety of controversies,
2153000	2160000	a fair few of which we'll return to later, but also discussing the use of its influence on that specific vote, and taking a more sober reflection on his actions.
2160000	2165000	He states that it was merely a social experiment slash meme to see if he could pick a team and it could win,
2165000	2169000	but it did go too far and he acknowledges and apologises for that.
2169000	2174000	I don't think this is an unreasonable response, I can see why it bothers some after his first attempt to address it,
2174000	2180000	but one aspect that is a central theme in this specific Twitlonger was his failure to consider the feelings of others previously,
2180000	2184000	and he clearly wanted to be more sensitive towards others moving forward.
2184000	2188000	I can respect that, and a lot of his friends and viewers alike respected it as well,
2188000	2195000	observing that anyone who spends this much effort addressing their past controversies and transgressions with that degree of introspection and detail,
2195000	2199000	must be demonstrating their ability to change as a person, I would agree on principle.
2199000	2205000	However, only time would tell if he had truly changed, it's one thing to commit to it, it's another to enact it.
2205000	2209000	Dream was an individual, and he had a right to his own opinions, thoughts and feelings,
2209000	2216000	however he also had a responsibility to not weaponise this faction of his audience who may derive a lot of their behaviour from his own.
2216000	2219000	It's a fine balance, and if Dream really wanted his full autonomy back,
2219000	2224000	he would definitely have to distance himself from the elements of Stan culture that may also be beneficial to him,
2224000	2227000	that fervent, albeit occasionally flawed loyalty.
2227000	2246000	It's what brought him a robust community, it's what bolstered views, sales and much more.
2246000	2249000	People are fast to criticise Stan's as being proponents of cancel culture,
2249000	2253000	but many also defended Dream when they believed his remorse was genuine,
2253000	2258000	he gave him an extra line of protection against many of those haters who viewed his actions less charitably,
2258000	2260000	those who wanted to see him fail.
2260000	2265000	In the Twitlong he expresses how much he adores his Stans, in spite of rumours that he actually despises them,
2265000	2270000	he references the numerous times he stood up for them as a creator and pledges his own loyalty in return to them,
2270000	2273000	he clearly values their presence a lot, and regardless of the reasoning,
2273000	2278000	one of the priorities here was to convince those who may be sceptical where his allegiances lie.
2278000	2282000	However, given that many would argue that these Stans have also precipitated certain incidents
2282000	2286000	where people have ended up being negatively affected, most recently in the Minecraft poll,
2286000	2290000	some may also feel he has neglected to address the downsides of his own community,
2290000	2292000	with a desire to retain their support,
2292000	2296000	and although in the months following Dream certainly moderated his demeanour more mindfully,
2296000	2300000	for a bit at least, there were still some people who felt that his more devoted viewers acted out of line,
2300000	2304000	and many critics felt Dream wasn't really proactive enough in countering it.
2304000	2309000	Every now and then he'd put out a tweet reminding people that toxicity wasn't really representative of those who supported him,
2309000	2314000	which is all well and good, but it was always done under the preface that he was defending Stans from being generalised,
2314000	2318000	which undermined any notion of recognition of the other point being made.
2318000	2322000	On the other end of the spectrum, when Stans did act out of line,
2322000	2325000	you'd regularly have people generalise them to represent the community as a whole,
2325000	2328000	which entrenched this divide between the two sides of the discussion.
2328000	2332000	On top of this, you had people who just did not forgive Dream for the use of his influence
2332000	2336000	and continued to maintain a narrative against him, provoking the ire of his viewer base.
2336000	2342000	However, every now and then you'd have someone who would recognise that the situation was more nuanced than either side presented it as.
2343000	2349000	It's honestly beyond me how people are able to hate on a Minecraft video, like it's very very strange,
2349000	2354000	and I'm just going to say it for people who are concerned, I'm alright with these messages,
2354000	2359000	okay, I'm alright after having received them, I'm not feeling down or anything.
2359000	2363000	If anything, I'm just a bit angry, not because I've received them,
2363000	2369000	but because people have this capacity to hate that much over such little things,
2369000	2373000	that what if other content creators are also getting the same thing,
2373000	2378000	and what if other content creators are out there who are maybe not as emotionally resilient,
2378000	2381000	or maybe a little bit more susceptible to these comments.
2381000	2384000	This is a clip from a creator known as Fizzybanger,
2384000	2388000	now he makes a variety of claims relating to his experiences with the Dream community,
2388000	2392000	some of which are rather strong, and as he doesn't show any accompanying evidence,
2392000	2394000	I'm not really in a position to comment on their verity.
2394000	2399000	With that said, his experience echoes many others and there's already strong evidence to support those.
2399000	2404000	His arguments are reasonable and fair, trying to work out how to expel the toxicity from the community.
2404000	2407000	You can't get rid of hate completely, that's just a part of society really,
2407000	2413000	you can't get rid of hatred, it's always going to be there, it's a malignant sort of thing,
2413000	2418000	but Dream could at least use his influence to try and maybe quell a lot of the toxicity
2418000	2422000	that people try to pass on through his name.
2422000	2428000	So that's what I'm saying, no hate on Dream, but I definitely think, not just him as well,
2428000	2431000	but a lot of people should start addressing this more the way that I have,
2431000	2434000	because I haven't seen anyone talk about this.
2434000	2439000	However, in the comment section you would see that the debate would regularly divert to which Dream Stands are the toxic ones,
2439000	2442000	how we'd characterise them, who is right and who is wrong,
2442000	2445000	and an underlying direct problem that leads into my next part.
2445000	2449000	I'm sure many Dream Stands want to see positive change between communities,
2449000	2453000	and wanted those in their own communities to be the best representatives of them as a whole,
2453000	2459000	but they didn't want to also be tied to the toxicity that they didn't see themselves as responsible for.
2459000	2464000	Equally, many in the Minecraft communities wanted to create content without being associated with Dream,
2464000	2470000	someone who has openly said that he's not that invested in the many aspects of Minecraft that other creators are.
2470000	2473000	However, this discussion often ended as soon as it began,
2473000	2478000	because no one was prepared to agree on what the guilty party was, or who they represented,
2478000	2482000	whether those Stands represented Dream or not, there was clearly some correlation,
2482000	2486000	and tensions were definitely palpable, there needed to be some sense spoken.
2486000	2488000	But who was going to speak it?
2488000	2496000	Stalker fans must be stopped, is something that's been said a lot on YouTube and Twitter over the last year or so,
2496000	2500000	involving a specific type of fan known as a Stan.
2500000	2502000	Dream himself, of course.
2508000	2518000	Dream's embrace of the Stan mentality was not for everyone,
2518000	2523000	mainly because some people just disagreed with the degree of parasocial relationships that he seemed to enjoy.
2523000	2530000	The Internet's intimacy certainly intensified certain aspects that other creators in Dream's radius struggled to alienate themselves from.
2530000	2533000	Unfortunately, that's another downside to being an extremely influential creator,
2533000	2537000	you don't just have an impact on your own fans, but on other creators in the genre.
2537000	2543000	So with that in mind, allow me to introduce you to someone known as Josh, or Josh if you're proper English.
2543000	2559000	Josh is a YouTuber and Twitch streamer, he plays a variety of games, most importantly Minecraft,
2559000	2565000	in which he was best known for his antics on SMP Live and SMP Up, servers operated by his then friends.
2565000	2572000	However, he also had areas of expertise outside the 3D sandbox, and didn't really pertain a specific loyalty to those communities or those within them.
2572000	2579000	He'd already expressed his distaste towards Stans earlier in the year, within a tweet requesting people cease sending his friends threatening messages.
2579000	2585000	Here he also suggests that viewers drop the Stan label if they want to distance themselves from those who have acted out of line.
2585000	2590000	It's clear that he was not enamoured by the more zealous of those within his audience, this was a warning shot.
2591000	2595000	Since then however, he had remained mostly quiet on the matter, until December at least.
2595000	2603000	At this point, Dream Stans were garnering notoriety for a few reasons, and they were becoming increasingly difficult to ignore due to their presence on trending pages,
2603000	2608000	with interesting hashtags to say the least, ones which I really cannot be bothered to read out.
2608000	2614000	Josh, clearly agitated by all this and other matters as well, decided to fully sever any relationship with the Stan community,
2614000	2622000	announcing on his alt account that anybody who considers themselves Stans, or part of any Twit or TWT, can unfollow him as he believes the culture to be toxic.
2622000	2630000	He further elaborated on this in another thread, labelling Dream Stans mentally unwell and framing them as a hive mind whose behaviour has become progressively worse,
2630000	2634000	which is quite the supposition given his own prior experiences with these groups of people.
2634000	2638000	If this whole situation was indeed worsening, how could someone like Josh ignore it?
2638000	2644000	These statements were initially met with support from his audience, however then our darling Dream, who had been mentioned in another of Josh's tweets,
2644000	2648000	decided to weigh in with his thoughts on the matter, with the graceful retort of,
2648000	2650000	you're an idiot, to his fellow Minecrafter.
2650000	2658000	George then vigilantly pointed out the poise of his associates response, and Dream informs him that his nuclear take unfortunately doesn't merit a proper response.
2658000	2664000	Of course, this then causes loads of viewers of both creators to pile on with their takes, before Dream returns to his main Twitter,
2664000	2670000	to once more defend the honour of his loyal disciples, tweeting out the new and improved Dream dictionary definition of Stans,
2670000	2678000	which equates to those who come together in a community while expressing that interest through love, support, sugar and spice and all things nice,
2678000	2680000	doesn't it just warm your heart?
2680000	2686000	Well, not really, but I can understand why he made it. Although it's rather heavy handed, it's clear he's trying to make a point here.
2686000	2692000	Go back a year, and Stans have always been characterised as the overly obsessive fan, hence why to support Manto of Stalker fan.
2692000	2698000	In last year though, I think many of these communities, and obviously Dream himself, have come to see the word Stan through a different lens,
2698000	2702000	one that doesn't necessarily represent the formerly perceived stereotype.
2702000	2709000	These large communities come in together to lend a mostly unconditional slate of support to a creator, with the caveat that they're not too problematic of course.
2709000	2714000	Alternatively, Stan has also become a buzzword for when a follower of Dream acts out of line,
2714000	2719000	and Dream laying down his gauntlet for how he defines a Stan is meant to challenge those who see them in a much different light.
2719000	2725000	This doesn't wholly address Josh's point though, after all he wasn't just attacking the conduct of fringe groups,
2725000	2732000	he was addressing the entire mentality supposedly behind Stan culture, and the allegedly cult-like worship of online figures.
2732000	2737000	Dream however had his own response for this as well, now some could class it as a rather uninspired no you argument,
2737000	2742000	after all, I really don't think a majority of people who have made this point are Tom Brady fans themselves,
2742000	2747000	I'm sure Tom Brady fans would have better things to do than provide insight on the internet's freshest YouTube drama.
2747000	2754000	However, I would say that he's trying to make the point that being fanatically enthusiastic for a certain creator isn't out of the ordinary at all for our culture,
2754000	2760000	and that we do it in plenty of other fields as well. Why should Stanning Dream be considered any different?
2777000	2780000	I loved talking to other people about my favourite team.
2780000	2785000	The position was elaborated on a few days later, in another video by Dream, appropriately called Stan's,
2785000	2790000	where he once again reasserts the argument that his stands are misunderstood, and unfairly portrayed by critics,
2790000	2797000	it doesn't really say anything different to what we know already, but does go into more detail in a way that relates the behaviour back to the human condition.
2797000	2802000	Now of course, that didn't make me obsessive, it made me human, and when you like something a lot,
2802000	2807000	you like to spend more time involving that thing that you like. You talk about it, you tell other people about it,
2807000	2812000	and you try to spend as much time involving it as you can, because you enjoy it, and it makes you happy.
2812000	2817000	He also talks about these misunderstandings and situations where people jump to the Dream Stan's toxic point of view,
2817000	2820000	without critically considering the other possibilities.
2820000	2825000	Technoblade fans, or just Dream haters, see anyone calling me better than Techno, or just one of the best Minecraft players,
2825000	2830000	as toxic Stan's, which just isn't true. It may be biased, but it's natural.
2830000	2836000	Overall, it's a pretty standard video without much noteworthy to it, though one quote did catch my attention.
2836000	2841000	But there's actually way more haters that take it too far, and usually in a much, much worse way.
2841000	2846000	I've had people try and find my address, spam my comment section, send me death threats, and so much more,
2846000	2850000	but not from Stan's, just from people who really, really don't like me.
2850000	2857000	Dream, mate, your own Stan's are not going to be sending you death threats, the point is that one creator's Stan is another person's hater,
2858000	2860000	and that perspective will differ between creators.
2860000	2864000	Also, very, very minor side note, Dream, but if you're going to talk about American football,
2864000	2869000	maybe don't use a photo of British football, or soccer, as you call it.
2869000	2874000	I don't agree with everything my fans do, obviously, and if they overstep boundaries, I tell them.
2874000	2877000	I tell them that I didn't like what they did, I tell them it made me uncomfortable.
2877000	2880000	And you can see that on my Twitter, as recently as a few days ago.
2880000	2886000	But when I tell them, they stop, because they genuinely care about me, and look up to me, and why would they want to make me upset?
2886000	2892000	But, the people who don't like me, they don't care, they don't stop, so it makes it much worse,
2892000	2896000	and that is a huge difference between Dream Hater's and Dream Stan's.
2896000	2901000	But Dream believed in his Stan's, he had faith in his Stan's, and he proudly stood with his Stan's,
2901000	2906000	and with people like Josh and other critics trying to resent his Stan's as something he didn't believe them to be,
2906000	2911000	he had good reason in his mind to, but was he tying himself to something that was beyond his control?
2911000	2913000	Well, let's talk about it.
2916000	2933000	Thank you guys for all the support, and don't let anyone convince you that something you genuinely enjoy is weird,
2933000	2937000	because they are weird for caring so much about what you enjoy.
2937000	2943000	Dream's response certainly irritated a few to say the least, and not necessarily because people disagreed with him, although many did.
2943000	2947000	I think the main reason was this sentiment that Dream didn't really mean what he was saying,
2947000	2950000	and as a matter of fact was merely saying it to appease his cash cow.
2950000	2954000	Many thought this was illustrated by the fact that Dream's opinions had taken a pretty sharp U-turn.
2954000	2959000	First of all, on Stan's themselves, a tweet from the year before showed him criticising Stan's fairly harshly
2959000	2962000	for not respecting his own boundaries, despite demanding their own.
2962000	2967000	Some argue that this makes him more reasonable in fact, showing him as not being afraid to criticise his own audience,
2967000	2971000	but many saw it more as a dismissal of his nature to previously criticise,
2971000	2974000	and moreover, a betrayal of the greater Minecraft community that had nurtured him.
2974000	2977000	Would he be the one to speak up if the same situation happened today?
2977000	2983000	The man who said that after affecting an in-game update that he didn't even really care for the game that he was renowned for?
2983000	2987000	The problem is that although Dream was a Minecraft creator, by all intents and purposes,
2987000	2990000	he was no longer affiliated with the Minecraft community in the way that he used to be.
2990000	2996000	Many in fact viewed him as antithetical to what they believed in, and it went deeper than that, to a personal level.
2996000	3000000	Dream's evolution as an individual can definitely be highlighted by his older content,
3000000	3006000	which saw him taking more traditionally gamer positions on matters such as language, cultural appropriation, and the rest.
3006000	3010000	In fact, one rather interesting document posited the claim that Dream was not merely an edgy gamer,
3010000	3015000	but a Red Dead Republican, who was an outspoken Trump supporter in Reddit forums, on a formally shared account.
3015000	3021000	Now, the content itself isn't overly offensive, this account clearly errs on the side of apologism as opposed to bigotry.
3021000	3026000	At the same time, many would argue that Trump and the policies that he's imposed are so inherently bigoted,
3026000	3031000	there really can't be room for those who make excuses for him, a position very common amongst socially conscious stans.
3031000	3035000	In a subsequent Page Spin response, he stressed that he had never ever supported Trump,
3035000	3041000	and although unsure of which posts were made by him, if any, he wanted to dis about anything that he said in the past that was him,
3041000	3045000	that these were more a result of upbringing and ignorance rather than any form of bigotry.
3045000	3049000	It's a fair response, but some were not convinced.
3049000	3056000	Online in particular, certain creators of recent have ended up being criticised for essentially selling out to what some brand is the woke mob.
3056000	3062000	When online and a small creator, many like to be outspoken edgelords against the grain,
3062000	3068000	and as soon as they obtain any sort of socially conscious following, they're keen to please behaviour they were previously known to indulge in.
3068000	3075000	Dream has regularly been invoked in these conversations, given his historical defensive behaviour that many of his stan community would take umbrage with,
3075000	3078000	with some change apart since the garnering of a proper follower base,
3078000	3082000	with many asserting that the reason for this about base being that it was profitable for him.
3082000	3086000	Dream would regularly be called out by his audience for previous stances he had taken,
3086000	3092000	with many seeing his responses as grovelling for forgiveness from an audience that he had previously claimed himself was not often permitting.
3092000	3096000	Now, it's very easy to take up that rather uncompromising position,
3096000	3102000	particularly given that popularity is often the only variable that has changed in the time between the U-turn in opinions.
3102000	3108000	However, I do think that it's a reductionist stance because it doesn't necessarily take into account the other personal changes one may undergo
3108000	3112000	when garnering traction online, and being able to have your own individual platform.
3112000	3119000	When you're in a toxic community, it can easily affect your behaviour and views that may precipitate actions that don't necessarily represent who you are individually.
3119000	3126000	That's basic psychology, and you would struggle to name many YouTubers who haven't changed as their influence has expanded, for better and for worse.
3126000	3131000	In fact, many viewers would argue that Dream has merely been educated, and thus reformed his positions accordingly.
3131000	3137000	This then disillusioned him with regards to his previous communities, and he actually found more loyalty and acceptance from his supporters,
3137000	3141000	while many of those criticising him and his beloved audience didn't even care for him.
3141000	3146000	This was the alternative theory. Dream came from a community that likely had a lot of outgoing edginess,
3146000	3151000	and once he met more socially conscious audience members, he matured and became more socially conscious himself.
3151000	3154000	This is the mutual influence that we spoke about earlier.
3154000	3158000	Dream established a bond with people outside of his comfort zone, and subsequently changed himself.
3158000	3162000	But how much were his audience willing to change, and how much could he ask of them?
3162000	3166000	How much of this was just people's own assumptions clouding their perceptions?
3166000	3170000	On top of this, some may ask why it even matters whether Dream was genuine or not.
3170000	3174000	If what he was doing was the right thing, why should it be a problem to decide whether he believes in it?
3174000	3176000	Well, I guess it comes down to principle.
3176000	3182000	If someone is willing to turn their back on previous stances for the pursuit of personal gain, what else are they willing to do?
3183000	3185000	So the word stan doesn't mean stalker fan.
3185000	3191000	As much as you can google the definition and say it does, my stans are a group of amazing, incredible, creative people
3191000	3194000	that are some of the most supportive people on the planet.
3194000	3200000	Although many would justifiably defend his position as one of a reformed individual who wanted to be more sensitive,
3200000	3201000	others just did not see that.
3201000	3207000	More, a person deserting their former beliefs to pander to a demographic that was financially lucrative to him,
3207000	3209000	throwing a culture under the bus to pursue something greater.
3209000	3214000	If that was the case, surely he'd continue to prioritise his preservation over any real moral compass.
3214000	3216000	Well, at this point, it was ambiguous.
3216000	3221000	You have people on one side, you have people on the other, each of them vociferously defending their standpoints,
3221000	3224000	with Dream designated as the slightly slanted spectator.
3224000	3226000	But there were a few ironclad facts.
3226000	3231000	We knew that Dream was aware of his power as a creator, because he had said it in a bit longer.
3231000	3237000	We knew that he was regretful of utilising his fans in the past to influence outcomes, and had vowed not to do it again.
3237000	3243000	We knew that he did not believe many of the claims that stand culture was toxic at its core, but did have toxic members,
3243000	3247000	and how they mobilised would depend, in part, on Dream's own demeanour.
3247000	3251000	These are all plausible at this point, but if he was going to back his own horse,
3251000	3256000	he needed to make sure that he didn't end up validating people's criticisms of it with his own actions.
3256000	3260000	Whether he wanted to acknowledge it or not, Dream did have an army at his disposal,
3260000	3264000	who would defend him no matter how much the odds were stacked against him.
3264000	3269000	Little did we, nor they, know how much the loyalty would be tested in the following months.
3269000	3271000	So, let's go for a run.
3286000	3288000	Speedrunning
3289000	3291000	It's a pretty popular activity amongst gaming communities.
3291000	3297000	For those who aren't aware, it's the act of playing through a game with the intent of completing it in as short a time as possible.
3297000	3301000	Now, the actual prerequisites for what would be classed as completion can depend on the game itself,
3301000	3307000	and even in-game conditions, as many have other features that may not be viewed as essential to the plotline's fulfilment.
3307000	3313000	Some may wonder how you can even speedrun a game like Minecraft, which was launched as an open-world sandbox, without any clear campaign mode.
3313000	3320000	Well, not too long after the launch, Minecraft's chief architect, Notch, also thought that there should be at least some end goal for the players,
3320000	3327000	so towards the end of 2011, the Ender Dragon was added, whose defeat would engender the final credits, signifying completion of the game.
3327000	3331000	However, the Ender Dragon wasn't just waiting for any old Tom, Dick, or Ari to slay them,
3331000	3336000	they reside in a place called The End, on an island where they launch arrow attacks on the besieged gamer.
3336000	3341000	The End can only be accessed through a portal created using Eyes of Ender, in a structure known as a stronghold.
3341000	3346000	However, you also need a sufficient number of Ender Pearls and Blaze Rods, which can only be dropped by certain mobs.
3346000	3352000	To put it simply, it's not considered a facile task. If you're interested in more, watch Kordwick's video, he summarises it well.
3352000	3357000	The game's challenging nature naturally makes it the target of competitive players who want to speedrun it,
3357000	3363000	and there are plenty of leaderboards dedicated to just that. As I mentioned earlier, Dream wasn't just a pretty smiley face,
3363000	3368000	he was skilled on the gameplay front of Minecraft as well, and did regularly partake in speedruns of his own,
3368000	3375000	publishing them online and submitting times for various leaderboards for the respective versions of the game, including world records.
3375000	3380000	He had hung up his running boots for a period of time, but appeared to make a comeback towards the end of 2020,
3380000	3385000	scoring impressive times on his Twitch streams, and subsequently tendering his results to the official Minecraft speedrunning team.
3385000	3391000	In around October, a week after the streaming question, he announced he would cease streaming his speedruns due to allegations they were fake,
3391000	3396000	expressing frustration that people would even question his ability when he has scored world records before.
3396000	3402000	Completely understandable. However, come the 11th of December, the same day in which he posted his earnest defensive stand culture,
3402000	3408000	another video was uploaded, this time though by the head moderator of speedrun.com, Geosquare,
3408000	3413000	alongside a rather lengthy document that seemed to express skepticism at Dream's performance.
3413000	3415000	Let's take a look at Dream's odds.
3417000	3424000	This isn't exactly a good look. Across six streams, Dream bartered 262 times and got 42 pro trades,
3424000	3428000	which when plugged into the formula, comes in at 1 in 177 billion.
3428000	3434000	Guess what else has a random drop chance in speedruns? Blaze rods. Anyone wanna guess what Dream's blaze luck was?
3434000	3436000	1 in 113 billion.
3436000	3441000	The accompanying document laid out in the most comprehensive terms the sheer unlikeliness of Dream's fortune
3441000	3445000	in acquiring various items necessary to facilitate one's transportation to the end.
3445000	3451000	The two items of interest were ender pearls and blaze rods, which have a pretty defined percentage probability of dropping
3451000	3453000	when you slay the mobs who may carry them.
3453000	3458000	As the graphs illustrated, Dream's accomplishment seemed to exceed the realms of chance,
3458000	3461000	an implied Dream may have downloaded mods to enhance his performance,
3461000	3465000	basically the gamer equivalent of anabolic steroids.
3465000	3469000	As Dream likes to point out, just because the odds of his luck happening are in the trillions,
3469000	3471000	it doesn't mean that's the same chance of him cheating.
3471000	3477000	I mean, with Illumina's considerably lucky 92% odds, it doesn't mean that there was a 92% chance of him cheating.
3477000	3482000	But the thing that Dream misses is that the odds for the event and the odds for cheating are still correlated.
3482000	3489000	If you perform an infinitesimally unlikely event, then you can be extremely confident that something went wrong that allowed it to happen.
3489000	3493000	Just because something is possible doesn't mean that it's at all feasible.
3493000	3497000	Here the numbers are just so large that they outweigh any conceivable subjective opinion.
3497000	3503000	The video also showed that Dream had previously attempted to defend himself when confronted with this information by the moderation team,
3503000	3508000	presenting a document from its own perspective which attempted to demonstrate the flaws in their own calculations.
3508000	3511000	However, Geosquare presented a response to this as well.
3511000	3518000	You can check the paper for a rebuttal, but we effectively examined the probability of this happening even if we checked multiple runners or streams first,
3518000	3523000	and the bias wasn't nearly strong enough to refute the idea that the odds were possibly tampered with.
3523000	3530000	Look, we're the first to admit that the data is actually biased, but it's nowhere near as biased as it would have to be to disqualify the evidence.
3530000	3534000	The thing with real-world data is that it's pretty much always going to be biased in some way,
3534000	3539000	but the field of statistics was made to interpret this stuff nonetheless and account for all the errors.
3539000	3546000	In our case, we've overcorrected the bias far enough so that we're biasing in favour of Dream, and we're still getting pretty crazy numbers.
3546000	3554000	All in all, the report and the video concluded that Dream's chances of succeeding a speedrun with this luck were approximately 1 in 7.5 trillion,
3554000	3559000	and as many other creators noted, that was being generous. Typically this sort of thing would be a private matter,
3559000	3564000	but as he was a public figure and had completed these speedruns publicly and continued to defend them privately,
3564000	3568000	the mods were clean and happy that he had sold these as authentic and continued to dispute this when challenged.
3568000	3574000	Now, with all this out in the open, and with all the previous pressure on him, how would Dream respond?
3574000	3577000	Well, he channeled his inner Trump.
3599000	3606000	It seems Dream won, and he won by a lot. He tweeted an additional reply stating that many good mods had spoken to him
3606000	3611000	and said that they were going to quit the team because they believed the so-called investigation to be a rotten one.
3611000	3616000	A very rotten one indeed. In the replies, Dream was met with support from his fans.
3616000	3620000	After all, how could he be accused of being too lucky in a luck-based game?
3620000	3627000	This wasn't Dream's only response, he also took to Discord to label Geo Square a clout-chasing clown who needs to go back to the circus.
3627000	3633000	Dream clearly felt strongly about this matter, and to an extent, with the context given, it was understandable.
3633000	3638000	After all, this was his credibility that was under scrutiny with quite damaging implications.
3638000	3644000	It was quite ironic after what had all just been said, what we know Dream knows, and the actual facts of the situation.
3644000	3651000	Geo Square himself demonetised all videos to avoid the allegation of clout chasing, and clearly went to a lot of effort to be meticulous.
3651000	3654000	I would say there are much easier ways to garner attention online.
3654000	3661000	To frame a person who merely thought they were doing their job as self-serving and to use incendiary language is obviously going to provoke audiences,
3661000	3667000	even the most tranquil. Dream really needed to back up its claims before jumping to such conclusions, but he was determined to do so.
3667000	3674000	Following this, a series of threads and tweets were posted in the coming days, all with the intent of exonerating him and his unlikely speedrun.
3674000	3679000	These included explanations, corrections, additional evidence, many of which seemed to substantiate his case.
3679000	3688000	This was topped off finally with his own document, filled to the brim with statistical jargon, and authored by a professional astrophysicist who worked at an online science consulting company.
3688000	3692000	Alongside this, he published an accompanying video to summarise these alternative findings.
3696000	3701000	Probability. Probability is the measurement of how likely something is to happen.
3701000	3709000	Recently, one of my speedruns that I did on Twitch has been analysed by the speedrun.com volunteer mod team and deemed as improbable to a degree that is nearly impossible.
3709000	3717000	So lucky in fact, that they came to the mathematical conclusion that it had 1 in 7.5 trillion odds of happening.
3717000	3722000	So, they put out a video and a long document talking about it, and this is my response.
3723000	3732000	The video and the document agree with the thesis of the original report published by the moderation team that the base probability of Dream's drop rates on the mobs in question are astonishingly low.
3732000	3738000	How they sought to compensate for other statistical biases that the moderation team may have established during their initial investigation
3738000	3743000	is conducted with intent to plant that seeded doubt in the mind of the viewer, though this does fluctuate.
3743000	3751000	Even with the harshest of odds, it is impossible to say with certainty that Dream cheated, so Dream was completely justified in defending his position if he believed it.
3752000	3758000	With these 11 streams included, the data shows quote, no statistically significant evidence that Dream was modifying the probabilities.
3771000	3777000	As a final closing note, if despite all the evidence that I've presented you still believe that the odds are too low, I want to mention a couple things from the report.
3777000	3780000	One, the expert that wrote the report says that he quote,
3791000	3795000	And the expert says that in order to find a correct probability of me changing the drop rates, quote,
3795000	3802000	external evidence that the probabilities were modified at this specific point would be needed to produce a significant probability of cheating.
3802000	3807000	Essentially, the fact that something unlikely happened shouldn't be the only evidence to back up an accusation.
3807000	3814000	I'll preface this by saying that I'm not an astrophysicist, I've dabbled in statistics, but I'd be lying if I said much of it beyond A-Level had stuck with me.
3814000	3820000	Even if you've only dabbled, you'd know something was fundamentally wrong with Dream's response and explanation.
3820000	3829000	Although it's true that the world is based on chance and anarchy to an extent, once you grant the fact that there were statistical bases for the possibility of particular outcomes relating to item drops,
3829000	3837000	the idea that Dream had that magnitude of good fortune just does not seem viable, even if the odds were less than 1 in 7.5 trillion.
3837000	3847000	If a game involves aspects of randomness and chance, is it possible for one player to be so lucky while playing that game,
3847000	3854000	that we can say, with mathematical certainty, that they are officially too lucky?
3854000	3859000	I don't really want to go into much further depth related to this. There's an excellent video by Stand Up Maths on the subject,
3859000	3866000	which basically deconstructs all the documents in question, including Dream's astrophysicist comrade, who seems to be lacking academic diligence.
3866000	3874000	And here, this number, the actual odds come out to be about 1 in 6300. That number is incorrect.
3874000	3878000	And this is within their own hypothetical situation they came up with.
3878000	3884000	The idea that if you flip a coin 100 times, what's the chance that you get 20 heads in a row?
3884000	3889000	And I ran the simulations myself and discovered they must have simulated it for heads and tails,
3889000	3897000	and then to compensate for the fact that it's just heads, they accidentally divided by 2 when they should have multiplied by 2.
3897000	3902000	And that's why they're out by a factor of 4. And it totally changes the thrust of their argument,
3902000	3908000	because it moves what they claim is the correct answer from one side of approximation to the other.
3908000	3916000	And it's just indicative of a lack of care and attention when putting together even their own hypothetical examples.
3916000	3921000	Do I think that Dream hired a person who he believed to be an incredibly qualified mathematician?
3921000	3927000	For sure, I highly doubt that anyone without some sort of maths aptitude would bother to write something like this,
3927000	3934000	let alone have the capability to write it. However, it feels like they were probably dragged from one of those essay writing companies
3934000	3938000	who flood your DMs when you tweet your frustration at your latest English assignments.
3938000	3943000	Whatever Dream was paying them wasn't enough to cover up the fact that there were still some glaring questions that hadn't been addressed.
3943000	3949000	It certainly didn't take long for r slash statistics to dissect the document and for videos to spring up publicizing this,
3949000	3952000	with momentum once more gradually turning against him.
3952000	3956000	I already apologized on Twitter because I had said some rude things to the mods after the video was released,
3956000	3962000	and I really don't want to send hate to anybody. I responded incredibly immaturely at first because I was angry and I really do regret my response.
3962000	3967000	But I would think that the average person being falsely publicly accused might react in a similar way. I don't know.
3967000	3970000	I'm very competitive, so being called a cheater just really set me off at first.
3970000	3973000	However, a lot of his audience stood by him, for one key reason,
3973000	3976000	that from their point of view, Dream didn't really have an impetus to lie.
3976000	3979000	It wasn't the biggest deal, there are much more pressing matters in the world,
3979000	3982000	and Dream wouldn't make a sincere appeal to his supporters otherwise,
3982000	3985000	their support surely wouldn't hinge on such a trivial matter.
3985000	3989000	Some audience members were publicly taking matters into their own hands,
3989000	3992000	taunting those involved, even echoing Dream's own comments.
3992000	3997000	If Dream had cheated, or even unknowingly played on modest settings, surely he would have no problem coming clean about it.
3998000	4003000	Hell, this is a sentiment he echoed a few months later in a drama relating to another creator by the name of John Swan,
4003000	4006000	who is no stranger to this channel in a different capacity.
4006000	4009000	John Swan in that case was completely in the wrong, and Dream was in the right,
4009000	4011000	but these words would come back to haunt him once more.
4028000	4041000	Dream and his fans felt like they were joined to the hit through this,
4041000	4044000	and it was in many ways the ultimate test of mutual loyalty.
4044000	4050000	The fact that Dream was positioning himself against every logical and rational explanation put forward by the Minecraft community,
4050000	4053000	they didn't want to accept his speedrun because statistically,
4053000	4057000	it did not seem possible that it was achieved under competitive conditions.
4057000	4060000	They had a greater volume of coherent evidence, and under scrutiny,
4060000	4063000	Dream's narrative struggled to hold water, yet Dream's support never waned.
4063000	4068000	In fact, it felt like it had been fortified, this idea that it was Dream versus the world.
4068000	4071000	Even if there was a valid reason that the world was against him,
4071000	4074000	it could be a rewarding experience being the person to stand behind him.
4074000	4078000	However, the downside of this is that you ultimately reward the wrong behaviour,
4078000	4084000	it's the exact same reason Trump was so successful, but also such a morally dubious person, in my humble opinion.
4084000	4090000	With me, I'm pretty young, so I feel like if I do anything I've done, I've definitely done stupid stuff in the past,
4090000	4095000	but I do stupid things, I learn from them, and then I grow, and I think my audience recognises that.
4095000	4098000	In many ways, I do think that stands were unfairly characterised by critics.
4098000	4103000	I don't think that there are a huge number of aggressive, unpleasant individuals who are part of these communities.
4103000	4108000	I also feel that many did prioritise their loyalty to a creator who defended them over the actual logical truth,
4108000	4112000	and maybe that's what being a Stan is in a way, like Dream said himself.
4112000	4115000	Like being a sports fan, like being a celebrity devotee,
4115000	4119000	that we are more predisposed to stand by them, even if the odds are stacked against them.
4119000	4123000	But this is YouTube, and people call stuff out not on the basis of whether it's natural,
4123000	4128000	but on the basis of whether it's right, and something didn't sit right with a lot of people about Dream's demeanour.
4128000	4133000	To them, even though he had turned his back on other communities, he still wanted to profit all the same.
4133000	4138000	He wanted to have his cake and eat it, and was regularly bullish in confrontation with those who questioned him,
4138000	4141000	even if, at his size, he was massively punching down.
4141000	4144000	This was a divide that only deepened by the conduct of his detractors.
4144000	4148000	Gio Square, the moderator who published the original document and corresponding video,
4148000	4155000	would find himself under criticism after creating a burner account to disseminate rumours that Dream had openly used racial slurs a few years prior.
4155000	4159000	These allegations were later assumedly proven false, and Gio Square published an apology,
4159000	4163000	but the professionalism of someone who was supposedly on a moderation team was brought into question,
4163000	4166000	and this idea of bias was probably kept in mind again.
4166000	4172000	It certainly undermined this idea of him being a neutral observer, even if his original assertions were correct.
4172000	4175000	And a lot of people were upset with that because they couldn't see how they could be biased.
4175000	4180000	I just want to share my point of view because from my perspective, maybe you can understand why I reacted the way that I did.
4180000	4184000	First of all, the speedrun.com Minecraft Bedrock Edition team, which is a similar team to the one who worked on this,
4184000	4190000	but for Bedrock Edition, completely banned me from ever submitting an official run, well before this happened,
4190000	4193000	without giving a single reason why. Other than that, they don't like me.
4193000	4198000	And I have never even played Minecraft Bedrock Edition or done a single speedrun on that game.
4198000	4200000	But I'm still banned, and I have yet to be told why.
4200000	4205000	Obviously, this didn't give me as much confidence in their sister team, Java Edition, giving me fair treatment.
4205000	4209000	However, I don't think that the actions of the Bedrock Team reflect on the intentions of the Java Team.
4209000	4212000	Another thing, though, is that while the mods were looking into my 1.16 run,
4212000	4218000	a lot of the official speedrun verifiers were saying incredibly disrespectful things about me, about my fans, and essentially harassing me,
4218000	4224000	which obviously led to me saying some things that I regret saying, but I'm sure that anyone can understand why that would be frustrating.
4224000	4230000	That's important to note, regardless of what could be said about Dream, his critics often didn't immerse themselves in glory either,
4230000	4236000	and for supporters of the YouTuber who may be subconsciously looking for ways to discredit those individuals, it really wasn't that hard.
4236000	4240000	When you're calling into question someone's character, you really have to be careful what you say.
4240000	4246000	The official owners and admins of speedrun.com, which run the leaderboard, made a statement that the video was, quote,
4246000	4254000	lacking in the level of objectivity we hope to see around communications by the game moderation team to the community, which I completely agree with.
4254000	4258000	Those who weren't fans, though, the reasons to dislike Dream just continued to multiply,
4258000	4262000	whether it was his attitude, his PR, or their own run-ins with viewers of his.
4262000	4269000	This renewed relationship spurred on by the speedrunning situation seemed to only serve to show everything destructive about his approach,
4269000	4271000	and not just for the Minecraft communities.
4287000	4290000	In months coming, the focus of the narrative seemed to shift.
4290000	4294000	There was still criticism surrounding how Dream fans acted, but it also went onto Dream,
4294000	4301000	and how he acted, how he appealed to his fans, how people felt he mobilised them, and how he subsequently responded to those who called him out.
4301000	4304000	I think the worst thing about it for many people was how contrived it seemed.
4304000	4309000	A lot of people had received a lot of blowback from these dramas that could have easily been set aside,
4309000	4315000	but Dream just couldn't help himself, he wouldn't yield a lot of the time either, and that amplified a lot of the harm that people faced.
4324000	4333000	Dream was always slightly at odds with his audience, at least personality-wise, and his roots show in his behaviour.
4333000	4337000	He's a very proud person, he's instinctively very defensive of his nature.
4337000	4344000	When people do attack him, he wants to stand up for himself, and he has done, even at times when, to be honest, I don't think it was worth doing.
4344000	4350000	For example, in March when he launched some new merchandise, maybe he'll decide to call him out because they thought it was a bit, well, minimalist to put it mildly.
4350000	4358000	Now in Dream's defence, the smiley face is probably the most noteworthy aspect of his brand, but that doesn't mean you just have to print it on a shirt without any additional personality.
4358000	4365000	However, once again, proud of the work that he had done, he responded, first tweeting the Dream classic know you argument.
4365000	4369000	After all, everyone who was attacking him was a massive Supreme fan, I'm sure.
4369000	4375000	Not to mention that I'm pretty certain Nike and other brands actually do put a bit of effort into the design of their products.
4375000	4376000	Emphasis on the bit.
4376000	4382000	Dream then suggests that it's all well and good being able to draw his merch in paint, but could the average fault finder manage to accomplish
4382000	4388000	many of the other feats he had achieved during this intricate operation in the formation of such a piece of artistic triumph?
4388000	4396000	Well, a lot of people's response was, yes, I think a lot of people could, because unless Dream was down on the front line stitching the shirts himself,
4396000	4398000	a lot of this is executive management.
4398000	4404000	A majority of large creators have merchandise because they can outsource a lot more of the more strenuous aspects of production,
4404000	4406000	and it means it's less work for them to do.
4406000	4413000	People reiterated these points, and Dream then qualified his own, like he does, explaining that although he didn't articulate it as concisely as he could,
4413000	4419000	he actually hires and employs his own staff for his plant, maintaining excellent work conditions and paying a livable wage,
4419000	4423000	which, if true, I'll give him kudos for, but I haven't worked there, so how would I know?
4423000	4426000	I don't blame Dream for having pride in what he's achieved as a creator.
4426000	4431000	I don't think any old idiot with a microphone could have established what he has, but you need to be grounded with your responses,
4431000	4435000	and every time Dream was called out, he seemed to react in a way that did not reflect that.
4435000	4440000	Now, he'd eventually adjust the viewpoint to be more empathetic, but it was too late every time.
4440000	4445000	He didn't directly start a battle between his audience and his critics, and by the time he has finally worked out what to say,
4445000	4450000	people have probably had their accounts suspended, arguing a point that didn't even have to be made in the first place.
4450000	4453000	But don't worry, he'll tweet a love part out, whatever.
4453000	4459000	Those who hate him bill it as dishonest, someone causing a load of unnecessary collateral damage and then trying to kiss it better.
4459000	4463000	Now, what many see as disingenuous, I personally see as a creator maybe a bit out of his depth.
4463000	4469000	Trying to appeal to an audience he never really requested, but also trying to maintain his own sense of self.
4469000	4473000	Regardless, it's what many began to bill as the Dream Cycle, and every time it occurred,
4473000	4478000	it only emphasised that pattern of behaviour that, to them, seemed so tired and played out.
4478000	4481000	In many ways, it felt like Dream had much more in common with his critics than his stans,
4481000	4484000	but couldn't align himself with the people so blatantly against him.
4484000	4488000	Stans are instinctively far more socially conscious than Dream has ever been.
4488000	4491000	And may well ever be, and that's no surprise.
4491000	4497000	We all know Dream has had his fair share of gamer moments and interesting opinions that many people around him held too.
4497000	4500000	And as we've noted earlier, he clearly wanted to move away from that,
4500000	4507000	but his desire to be something he had never truly properly understood before just presented a person who was putting on an act.
4507000	4511000	There's no problem with someone who's trying to be what they view as the best person they can be.
4511000	4516000	The problem with Dream is that he didn't have a grasp on social conscience with the people he wanted support from,
4516000	4520000	nor what he was being called out for most of the time, and therefore he never really grew as a person,
4520000	4523000	and more just tweaked his responses after the fallout.
4523000	4525000	Public persona by focus group, essentially.
4525000	4528000	This was epitomised recently when he released his song Mask.
4528000	4532000	I have to say, it wasn't my cup of tea, the lyrics themselves are a bit heavy-handed,
4532000	4538000	anyone who needs to explicitly explain the meaning of their songs in the lyrics twice is clearly missing the mark of songwriting.
4538000	4542000	And the music video, well, I have a lot of thoughts about that one, but I digress.
4542000	4548000	As expected, plenty of people came after him for his song, for a variety of reasons, some valid, some not so valid,
4548000	4554000	and Dream responded, because once again, whatever our opinions are, the song clearly meant a lot to him and I'd never take that away.
4554000	4559000	However, in probably one of the strangest decisions, he responded to arguably the most valid point of them all,
4559000	4564000	the direction of his video, which drew a lot of criticism for how it approached treatment of mental disorders.
4564000	4569000	This is a particularly sensitive subject given Dream's younger audience and their responsiveness to his narratives.
4569000	4575000	Nonetheless, maybe Dream had a point to make. What did his response entail though? Well, take a bloody guess.
4575000	4584000	It was a no-you argument, but this time juxtaposing this criticism with the idea that those attacking him enjoy music that blindly glorifies drugs.
4584000	4590000	However, this was a big mistake on Dream's part because he didn't consider that he was committing what some class as a micro-aggression,
4590000	4596000	which is basically a subconscious offence of bigotry, where someone unknowingly perpetuates a negative perception of a marginalised group,
4596000	4603000	and before he knew it, a variety of threads and tweets popped up explaining why it was problematic, with many coming from within his own fanbase.
4603000	4608000	This only deteriorated when he was called out for defending his fanbase against the claim they were anti-black,
4608000	4613000	which didn't sit well with many in his audience who felt like there were serious shortcomings in how they had been treated.
4613000	4618000	It wasn't long until Dream removed his tweet and organised a somewhat messy apology.
4618000	4622000	Initially published to his private, now deleted account, he made it public so all parties concerned could see it.
4623000	4630000	He states he completely understands why it was harmful and then ticks all the apology boxes by linking other awesome black creators.
4630000	4633000	But this time, it did not feel right.
4647000	4651000	There was something rather soulless about Dream's apology, like it was a masquerade.
4651000	4659000	He said he understood why what he did was hurtful, and although I don't necessarily expect every person to explain exactly why what they did was wrong,
4659000	4663000	I do question if he really understood at all this time.
4663000	4667000	Mainly because, incoming hot take, I don't really think he did anything wrong at all.
4667000	4674000	Sure, his argument was dumb, and it did remind me of the old memes where someone thinks their music is so much deeper than it actually is,
4674000	4680000	but outside of that, its purpose was clearly intended to show the shallowness of those who criticise the fact that he mentions medication,
4680000	4688000	as opposed to the typical drugs. The idea that many of these haters hear songs, talk about drugs and celebrate it, while criticising people who betray them in a more vulnerable light.
4688000	4695000	But okay, that may have been Dream's intent, but he still played into a negative stereotype, that's the point of a microaggression right?
4695000	4703000	Well, I disagree. People's main argument within a lot of the threads critical of Dream's comment was that the core message behind his statement was rooted in racism,
4703000	4708000	that being the drugs-drugs comment was very typical of how bigots characterise hip-hop music.
4708000	4716000	This would be a valid point if his comment was designed to attack the music itself, but from my perspective, the comment was fully designed to attack the listener,
4716000	4723000	Charles and his proverbial friend, who in my opinion sound like the type of suburban frat boys who probably misinterpret the meaning of a lot of rap music that discusses such substances.
4723000	4730000	Even then, if you want to call back to the classic emo tweet about Nicki Minaj, the point wasn't that Nicki Minaj is hip-hop and therefore bad,
4730000	4734000	the point was that at the time, the song Stupid Ho was viewed as somewhat shallow.
4734000	4742000	What made the meme wrong wasn't that Stupid Ho is actually some profound statement on the state of humanity, apologies to any Nicki stans watching,
4742000	4746000	but more the fact that whatever song is shallow to some people, people like what they like,
4746000	4751000	and whether it's shallow or not doesn't mean someone can't enjoy it, it's not really a racist meme, it's just dumb.
4751000	4758000	It's why Stupid Ho is in the caption and not a song by Grandmaster Flash or Common, though I'm sure it wouldn't be hard to take them out of context.
4758000	4764000	Hell, there's plenty of internal discourse over the current state of hip-hop music from many more experienced artists themselves,
4764000	4771000	many of whom don't approve of how newer generations of rappers and musicians in general have adapted the struggles in a light that undermines their original message.
4771000	4774000	It's a discussion that's been going on for decades.
4774000	4781000	Now, there are definitely racists who have made the claim that hip-hop music at its core glorifies drugs, violence, and the rest to attack the black community,
4781000	4786000	when in reality, it's a much more systemic problem that has been continuously ignored by countless governmental regimes.
4786000	4793000	However, to tie that back to Dream, when it's not even the point of his tweet, I mean, unless you can really prove that there's a connection,
4793000	4796000	unless you have a load of studies, it's a real waste of energy.
4796000	4801000	He literally does the bare minimum to contextualise, not even implying the genre of music this could be.
4801000	4808000	To me, it's absurd, and I feel strange even having to explain it, because you can't really assume much about a comment like that,
4808000	4812000	and I'm sure if Dream didn't have a commitment to his audience, he would have said it was absurd too.
4812000	4820000	Instead, we have an empty, grovelling apology which validates a very weak idea of education without people actually learning anything.
4820000	4826000	Although I think it's important that public figures don't express themselves in a way that could be inflammatory against specific groups of people,
4826000	4832000	it's also on us and the viewers to try and interpret their words with an openness and trust with regards to what they're trying to say,
4832000	4838000	and just because we may be hurt or we may interpret it in a cynical way doesn't mean that a person has been hurtful.
4838000	4843000	We may have just read too much into something, even if we are a part of that affected focus group.
4843000	4845000	That principle is universal.
4845000	4848000	With that said, in many ways I understand why Dream apologised.
4848000	4854000	Ultimately, it's one tweet, and in the grand scheme of things, he was probably just exhausted because his thread comes across as just that.
4854000	4858000	It would have been much more trouble to dig his heels in and declare war on all of Twitter,
4858000	4863000	but it was a sign of the times, of that appeasement, and I think that's what tipped people off outside his fanbase.
4863000	4870000	However, to understand people's frustration, you have to see this in the full context of his at least now decently sized collection of apologies.
4870000	4874000	But also for what he didn't apologise for as well.
4874000	4878000	You see, I didn't just attempt to dissect Dream's tweet to own the people on Twitter.
4878000	4883000	In fact, I accept that people who were bothered by the tweet's perspective may have a point.
4883000	4884000	They may be valid.
4884000	4888000	Maybe Dream was right to apologise given that you could interpret his words in such a way,
4888000	4892000	and people who carry racial trauma feel that trauma resurfacing when certain comments are made.
4892000	4898000	As someone with my own trauma, my opinions differ on how we should approach others' language that may activate that trauma,
4898000	4901000	but I accept that this is subjective.
4901000	4906000	But if Dream is so receptive to apologising for a tweet in which the implication is at best tentative,
4906000	4913000	why can't he show some sympathy towards people who may be bothered with him having a music video where a young version of himself throws away his medication?
4913000	4917000	Well, sometimes the question seems dependent on who's upset.
4917000	4919000	You remember that old speedrunning Skylark we spoke about?
4919000	4921000	Well, Dream actually did apologise.
4921000	4925000	You wouldn't be blamed for missing it as it was removed less than a week after it was published.
4925000	4928000	But an apology is an apology, I guess.
4928000	4932000	And in the apology, Dream explains how after all the drama had transpired,
4932000	4936000	he had discovered that he was actually using a disallowed mod on the version of the game he was playing,
4936000	4938000	and that he regretted behaving the way he did.
4938000	4941000	He'd gone through so many emotions at that point, he just wasn't thinking straight.
4941000	4943000	I know the struggle, Dream.
4943000	4949000	He said he planned on letting it die down, but wanted to clear his conscience after the animosity had persisted between himself and the mod team,
4949000	4952000	and although he doesn't necessarily agree with their behaviour at all points,
4952000	4957000	he acknowledges that his actions were rash and driven by his own personal judgements of the mod team's intentions,
4957000	4962000	rather than what could be logically and mathematically drawn from these striking anomalies in his actual performance.
4962000	4967000	As an apology, it is well written, and manages to explain his perception pretty rationally,
4967000	4971000	however it didn't wash with many of those who had criticised him for a few reasons.
4971000	4974000	Firstly, his whole justification for holding off addressing it.
4974000	4978000	He states he thought he'd let it rest for a few years, and reveal it when no one actually cared anymore,
4978000	4980000	he didn't want to be the centre of drama again.
4980000	4985000	However, the problem is that Dream perpetuated the drama, and a lot of hassle against these people,
4985000	4989000	a fact that he acknowledges himself, saying that it's probably been torture for the mods.
4989000	4993000	The one thing that I'm sure the mods wanted from this situation is closure,
4993000	4997000	and as long as the question of whether Dream cheated was contended, they would never have that.
4997000	5001000	Here, admitting to cheating wouldn't have looked bad on the mod or flared up drama against them,
5001000	5005000	it wouldn't have upset them more, regardless of what torture they had endured up to that point.
5005000	5010000	Dream tried to make it look like a point of selflessness, and it's just not very convincing.
5010000	5014000	Other points mainly pertain to how he tonally conveys himself,
5014000	5018000	there's a lot of comments that people feel were a bit pointed towards the mods,
5018000	5020000	playing up his own history with them to justify his actions,
5020000	5026000	alongside unsubstantiated and unfalsifiable claims that people feel were placed there to embellish his perspective,
5026000	5028000	and make it feel more justified than it was.
5028000	5033000	Many found it hard to buy the fact that Dream would go to such lengths to defend something that he wasn't even sure about.
5033000	5038000	This is the person who tweeted with conviction, who hired mathematicians to justify his point of view,
5038000	5041000	who published videos, all proclaiming his truth.
5041000	5046000	The fact that he now says he wasn't even sure just makes it worse given how he used his platform in the first place.
5046000	5052000	There was no way that the masses in these communities affected were going to forgive him for this.
5052000	5055000	But was the apology even for them?
5057000	5065000	On one hand, you had two very different apologies, in their structure, in their presentation, in their actual context.
5065000	5071000	And that makes sense in a way, after all the latter was a much more serpentine situation, warranting some elaboration.
5071000	5077000	However, when you analyse the actual language in his belated apology, it's hard to say it's directed towards a different party.
5077000	5083000	There's a lot of emotional language that I wouldn't say is inherently manipulative, but is designed to elicit sympathy from the readers.
5083000	5088000	However, to elicit sympathy, you need people who are prepared to be sympathetic, and in a YouTuber's case,
5088000	5091000	the people who are most likely to be sympathetic are your own audience.
5091000	5096000	Now, maximising understanding is something that is quite normal when explaining anything to anyone.
5096000	5101000	I don't want to say that it's a tactic employed to solely win over your fans, but there are distinctions that can be made.
5101000	5108000	Dream talks about how scared, stressed, angry he was, all the strong emotions that he went through when being challenged on the nature of his speedrun.
5108000	5113000	These aren't details particularly relevant to the situation for many interested, but they are to those who support him,
5113000	5117000	and want to assume that he had the best intent, even when he acted dishonourably.
5117000	5121000	People trying to bring everyone round to their perspective will logically take the route of empathy,
5121000	5126000	explain their actions in a way that people can identify the mindset when the actions were taken,
5126000	5131000	and at least make sense of them, even if they don't agree, and this will build a level of respect between the parties involved.
5131000	5136000	This is present in Dream's confession, but his appeals to sympathy are much more pervasive and noticeable,
5136000	5142000	and unless you brought people into a position where that's effective, then many will view it as cheap and calculated,
5142000	5145000	which is exactly how a lot of his detractors interpreted it.
5145000	5151000	Anyone can be scared, anyone can be stressed, those feelings don't necessarily precipitate the actions documented.
5151000	5158000	Plenty of other people in fearful mindsets will act differently, it's all about how the person interacts with those feelings on a unique level.
5158000	5163000	Understanding that is what prevents it from happening again, because lord knows we're all going to be scared,
5163000	5166000	stressed, and angry again at points in our lives.
5166000	5170000	I'm going to go out on a limb and say that it's not the worst confession slash apology.
5170000	5176000	I think the problem was it wasn't directed towards the mods or anyone who was actually involved in this situation,
5176000	5178000	anyone actually deserving of an apology.
5178000	5182000	It was directed towards the people who Dream believed had a capacity to forgive him,
5182000	5187000	because whether right or wrong, he clearly has it in his mind that there are people who blindly hate him,
5187000	5191000	regardless of what he says or does, and it's not worth the effort to try and bring them round to his perspective.
5191000	5197000	At the same time, this is an issue, because those who were caught in the fallout of this situation probably do deserve a public apology,
5197000	5200000	and there's no real sign of that in this post.
5200000	5207000	He says sorry directly once, to quote anyone he let down, which is again, indicative that this is for his audience.
5207000	5210000	After all, to let someone down, they need to have an expectation of you,
5210000	5214000	and many of those who didn't like Dream had no expectation in the first place.
5214000	5217000	To them, this was just him admitting to what they'd always known,
5217000	5221000	and even if they'd borne the brunt of his actions, he didn't want to apologise to them,
5221000	5226000	particularly for any fan antics because he didn't want to play into that narrative of toxicity peddled by them,
5226000	5231000	and he certainly didn't want to vindicate any of them more than they already would have been through such an admission.
5231000	5238000	Dream's apology begs us all to move on from the drama, and the reality is that we have.
5238000	5245000	It's been six months, so why is he in his bathtub at 4am, bringing it up again?
5245000	5252000	It's because earlier in the day, moderators rejected yet another run of his for cheating,
5252000	5256000	his 1.15 world record speedrun.
5256000	5264000	Gotta say it's some really interesting timing for him to suddenly become apologetic about the situation.
5275000	5280000	Apologies shouldn't bank on whether they forgive you or not, and you should still apologise if you feel you've done something wrong,
5280000	5282000	even if you know they're not going to forgive you.
5305000	5315000	When you look at the two apologies side by side, it's not hard to understand why people were bothered.
5315000	5319000	Dream takes mere hours to apologise for a trivial matter relating to a tweet,
5319000	5323000	and months to apologise for something that caused people to invest time and effort,
5323000	5328000	and face down stigma from his audiences for even daring to try and prove something that should have been accepted from the start.
5328000	5332000	Dream's own principles seem to be based on who was affected,
5332000	5338000	and of course we'll all have our biases and inconsistencies, it's natural for a creator to be more interested in their own audience,
5338000	5344000	but there's a line, and for many, Dream crossed it, to the detriment of individual users and greater communities alike.
5344000	5348000	However, if you choose to believe his version of events presented in the apology,
5348000	5351000	then many of his supporters would argue that his perspective makes complete sense.
5351000	5354000	If we go back throughout the video, it also makes sense,
5354000	5358000	the same pattern that has continuously surfaced throughout the stories, no matter how different they may seem.
5358000	5363000	The Dream felt persecuted, the Dream felt that there was a narrative being crafted against him and his audience,
5363000	5369000	and that it was being pushed by those who were envious of his own success, and thriving community.
5369000	5373000	Although he didn't present any in his pace bin, there was sufficient evidence that the mods did not like him,
5373000	5379000	and whether his response was logical or not is besides the point, it was human, and certainly not impossible.
5379000	5381000	That is with the proviso that you believe him of course,
5381000	5384000	but the fact that it's not off the table is indicative to say the least,
5384000	5387000	however you can be relatively confident about how his audience felt.
5387000	5392000	What we witnessed here is essentially a deficit in critical thinking, a product of polarisation.
5392000	5397000	All it would have taken is a significant group within Dream's circle to publicly challenge his assertions,
5397000	5403000	and yet it never really happened because people were so focused on fighting the greater narratives that were being charged against them.
5403000	5407000	I don't think stands were lying through their teeth to protect them, I think they genuinely believed him,
5407000	5413000	and from their own perspective, he was one of the only creators who was honest and upfront in characterising their own behaviour,
5414000	5419000	so by extension, he was going to be a more reliable narrator to them, nobody wanted to desert an ally.
5419000	5425000	So when he came round to explaining his own perspective, that was rooted in the idea of this deluge of hate towards him.
5425000	5429000	This resonated with his audience because that's what they felt too, but not his critics,
5429000	5434000	because only the former concur with the presupposition that he was experiencing disproportionate hate in the first place.
5434000	5439000	His audience understood where he was coming from, and therefore they by and large forgave him,
5439000	5441000	because what Dream was saying was real to them.
5442000	5443000	But what is real?
5453000	5457000	What Dream has created in less than a couple of years is by many means unprecedented,
5457000	5462000	therefore one of the typical responses to those critical of him is that it's hard to expect to know exactly how to act,
5462000	5465000	because there are very few prior examples of it in the YouTube community.
5465000	5470000	At the same time, as illustrated by the Dream cycle, there seems to be, from many people's perspectives,
5470000	5476000	this idea that these antics have reached a point of repetition, that Dream may have some degree of self-awareness of what he's doing.
5476000	5480000	Dream may be the first from the YouTube sphere to experience what we're discussing today,
5480000	5484000	but he's also experienced it on a continuous basis, and you expect him to have learned by some point.
5484000	5489000	However, self-awareness does tie into how much responsibility he should take as a creator,
5489000	5492000	particularly in regards to the more destructive drama.
5492000	5496000	There's an impulse to a lot of what Dream does on the surface, which in a way makes him relatable to a lot of his audiences.
5496000	5502000	He portrays himself as a bit emotional and impulsive, and even if he doesn't always do the right thing, he seems to think that he is at the time.
5502000	5505000	It's that which allows his audience to maintain faith in him.
5505000	5510000	You can look at a lot of studies in the fan culture that establishes how fans want to see themselves in their idols,
5510000	5515000	and in spite of every blunder Dream seems to fall afoul of, it only seems to reinforce the bond between the two parties.
5515000	5523000	That's epitomised by this 4am confession post that gives off the surface level impression that something has been weighing on his conscience and he just has to talk about it.
5523000	5529000	But there were a lot of skeptics who believed that this was just another part of the ruse, this simulation of a person who is identifiable to his audience
5529000	5534000	but is merely exploiting the idea of understanding between them, rather than actually understanding.
5534000	5540000	The fact that he launched a toxic attack on people who doubted his speedrunning credentials on the same day that he acknowledged that audiences
5540000	5544000	had the capacity to behave with toxicity themselves seemed too ironic to be sincere.
5544000	5550000	Even if he genuinely believed he didn't cheat, why would he emotionally rile up his viewers with polarising and divisive language
5550000	5556000	when he knows exactly what the consequences entail? Is he really that impulsive, or is he really that calculated?
5556000	5559000	Well, let's have a look at the former first.
5559000	5571000	Dream can be pretty reactionary, however as his critics have observed this can sometimes be beneficial to him,
5571000	5575000	particularly when he wants to align himself with his audience's perception of him.
5575000	5581000	At the same time, sometimes his responses aren't remotely helpful either, for example, the situation pertaining to his music.
5581000	5585000	He didn't really receive many thoughts for his comments, just backlash from his own viewers.
5585000	5590000	And it's not the first time that's happened, it's what he was regularly called out for when he acquired a stand-up,
5590000	5595000	and although he quickly climbed down from his prior positions, there was no real benefit to what he previously said.
5595000	5601000	Dream has his own feelings on matters, but at the same time many would question whether it's compatible with the other side of him.
5601000	5624000	Looking at Dream's apologies and qualifications regularly show a different portrayal,
5624000	5627000	and that's the one that a lot of those who aren't fond of him see,
5627000	5630000	a person who doesn't want to face consequences for trouble that they have instigated.
5630000	5635000	Dream has the ability to be very rational, and even if he has said something that seemed impulsive in the moment,
5635000	5639000	he clarifies points in a calmer manner down the line. It was rather bemusing in many ways,
5639000	5645000	it felt like we had two very divisive sides of him, because he clearly showed an ability to be mild and reasonable,
5645000	5649000	and yet regularly ended up in the firing line of his own comments and subsequent fallout,
5649000	5652000	whether they be on Twitter, YouTube comment sections, or Discord servers.
5652000	5656000	Even if it didn't aid him, he still did it, and for many it wore very thin.
5656000	5659000	But what if it was just a ruse?
5659000	5662000	When people think of such cynical ploys to exploit demographics,
5662000	5665000	people often think of large corporations and their rather shallow activism,
5665000	5668000	designed to reap people's pockets without bringing about real change.
5668000	5672000	It's often hard to do it on a YouTube level because people often subscribe to you for personal reasons,
5672000	5676000	for you, and they're often going to notice when you're not really expressing what you truly believe.
5676000	5681000	Many critics believe they saw something like that within Dream, particularly given his previous positions,
5681000	5686000	that this wasn't really someone learning, moreover someone manually trying to adjust to his audience's expectations.
5686000	5692000	Over time, it starts to sound like a broken record, especially when combined with the at-points rather superficial levels of activism.
5692000	5696000	For example, at the end of May, Dream proudly announced that in the spirit of gay rights,
5696000	5700000	all donations from his Twitch streams the following month would be going to LGBT-focused charities,
5700000	5702000	a heartwarming cause to say the least.
5702000	5707000	However, Dream then proceeded to not stream until right at the end of June,
5707000	5710000	with many alleging that he only did it then because he was called out.
5710000	5714000	You can't really be impulsive in attempting to appear calculated,
5714000	5720000	but you can be calculated in attempting to appear impulsive, and I think that idea was solidified with his pace bin.
5720000	5726000	But given that he also says, by his standard, stupid shit on a regular basis, it's obviously not the full picture.
5726000	5732000	So what is? I think the Dream is impulsively defensive and deliberately apologetic.
5732000	5737000	I don't think it's what he's used to, but I think he often feels pushed in a position to do so,
5737000	5741000	mainly due to the expectation of those who don't really have that much in common with him.
5741000	5745000	The problem is that on one hand his apologies take the boxes and do the job,
5745000	5750000	the Stans accept it because he admits that what he did was wrong and that at the end of the day it's not that big a deal,
5750000	5754000	but the issue is that in those scenarios it provides the illusion of personal growth,
5754000	5760000	when in many cases these apologies are done with a hollowness because they don't touch into what causes the issue in the first place,
5760000	5764000	which is, in my opinion, Dream's own nature to be provocative.
5764000	5770000	Not insensitive, not conservative, but provocative, and I think Stans have struggled to account for this as well.
5770000	5787000	Music
5787000	5792000	Not too long after Dream admitted to his malfeasance, he ended up on a stream with Hassan Piker,
5792000	5796000	a popular leftist twitch streamer who had tumbled down the Dream rabbit hole a few days prior.
5796000	5799000	Hassan had made some pretty charged statements against Dream himself.
5800000	5803000	What the fuck are you guys doing? Do you know nothing?
5803000	5810000	Like, do all you know is just like Minecraft eat hot chip and fucking make like Minecraft tweets?
5810000	5813000	Bro, that's literally, he's literally like platforming.
5815000	5817000	Oh my lord, dude.
5819000	5822000	Oh my god, that shit is fucking wild, dude.
5822000	5831000	Bro, listen, instead of freaking out, instead of freaking the fuck out, yeah, he said Pizzagate is real.
5831000	5833000	Good start, good way to start this.
5833000	5840000	You guys lose your shit over like Carl Jacobs being a fucking Ice Poseidon fan at some point or some shit,
5840000	5842000	or washing ice Poseidon.
5842000	5848000	That is unhelpful, like attacking Carl Jacobs or that is ridiculous, okay?
5848000	5855000	Attacking like your favorite content creators and like writing massive fucking threads about how,
5855000	5865000	about how like it's problematic to bring up slavery in any capacity in a fucking video game roleplay scenario.
5865000	5868000	A thread is ridiculous.
5868000	5876000	Just having Notch on a video like this with 60 million views is significantly fucking worse.
5876000	5886000	To have Notch in 2020 on your fucking 16.5 million view video game, like this is years after,
5886000	5891000	literally fucking years after, like when everybody knew what the fuck Notch was,
5891000	5896000	when Microsoft did everything they could to separate themselves from Notch.
5896000	5897000	That's wild, dude.
5897000	5902000	How the fuck are you going to sit there and cancel like TommyInnit or Carl Jacobs
5902000	5907000	when Dream is just like fucking chilling with Notch, dude?
5907000	5912000	Which, as always, led Dream to escalate the situation, put out some rash treats, all that jazz.
5912000	5916000	However, this time, because once again, these were social issues pertaining to Dream's previous work,
5916000	5919000	and his fanbase had some strong feelings on those matters,
5919000	5923000	he was quickly compelled to retract these comments and actually resolve any hostility,
5923000	5926000	going on to stream with Hasan to discuss these issues.
5926000	5929000	I'll be using clips from that stream to parallel the narratives in this part.
5930000	5931000	Hello.
5931000	5932000	What's good?
5932000	5933000	How's it going?
5933000	5934000	Alright, talk to me, Dream.
5934000	5938000	When we have a Dream apology or clarification, particularly to his fans,
5938000	5940000	it will normally go down the route of ignorance,
5940000	5945000	that our good Minecrafting friend here didn't realise what he said was going to negatively affect people.
5945000	5950000	It's not what he intended to say or do, even if his words or actions were driven by a sincere sentiment,
5950000	5954000	but it doesn't happen on a regular basis to many other YouTubers in his position,
5954000	5957000	and that's not just because of the haters or the stans.
5957000	5963000	When I was like, when I was like 16, and Trump was first running, I thought Trump was like, funny.
5963000	5967000	And that was obviously, I was like an idiot kid growing up, like you mentioned, in Florida,
5967000	5972000	in a red area, going to online school, you know, being homeschooled, like,
5972000	5975000	it was a total product of my environment, I said that.
5975000	5978000	I think many creators have the capacity to offend the masses with their thoughts,
5978000	5983000	because we all have selfish thoughts, we all have defensive thoughts, we all have unpalatable thoughts.
5983000	5985000	I think it's in the instincts of many people.
5985000	5988000	It's just the difference is we keep them as thoughts.
5988000	5991000	When you're a large creator, you need to train yourself to have a filter.
5991000	5996000	Dream has often lacked that, the ability to just know when to say absolutely nothing.
5996000	5998000	There's nothing wrong with having pride in what you create,
5998000	6001000	I understand why people trying to deride your work may bother you,
6001000	6005000	but you don't have to go out of your way to attack them as long as you know it's good.
6005000	6007000	You're not going to change their mind that way,
6007000	6010000	all you're doing is placing yourself in the crossfire for more conflict.
6011000	6013000	In a way, I think Dream knew that though,
6013000	6016000	that his method of tweeting wasn't going to make him many new friends,
6016000	6019000	he was just channeling the outspoken gamer he'd always been.
6019000	6022000	A lot of people in that community talk a lot of shit,
6022000	6023000	we've spoken about that before.
6023000	6027000	I think the problem is that Dream's popularity intersects with a fandom,
6027000	6031000	and a greater community who didn't necessarily perceive the issues the same way he did.
6031000	6033000	To them, his strongly worded comments would hold a lot more weight,
6033000	6035000	and when Dream spoke in an inflammatory way,
6035000	6039000	when he had his heated gamer moments, people would act on it.
6039000	6042000	He'd end up in these ridiculous back and forth with creators
6042000	6044000	who probably took things far more seriously than they should have,
6044000	6047000	with audiences who were far too invested themselves.
6061000	6064000	But Dream somehow always managed to end up taking things seriously himself,
6064000	6068000	and instead of saying, hey, I overreacted, which is 90% of Dream's problem,
6068000	6072000	he'd often then react to it in a way that escalated the situation again.
6072000	6075000	I feel like this is because he was aware that people cared by then,
6075000	6077000	and he didn't want to appear like he was disinterested.
6077000	6081000	He didn't want people to feel like they'd spent whatever allotted amount of time
6081000	6084000	arguing over something that he was hardly paying any mind to.
6084000	6087000	Dream likes to make supporting him a rewarding experience,
6087000	6090000	which is why he tweets out her love hearts at the end of every online argument,
6090000	6093000	because he doesn't want people to think that it's a fruitless venture.
6093000	6096000	However, in those cases, it kind of provides the impression
6096000	6099000	that he's pulling his fans aside and saying, good job,
6099000	6101000	like when someone pretends to rep around a person,
6101000	6103000	but is saying something different in confidence.
6103000	6105000	In a way, I don't think it's exactly that.
6105000	6108000	I think it's more a thank you for continuing to support me,
6108000	6112000	but I think it's usage kind of leads people to thinking he can't control his audience,
6112000	6116000	and that what matters to him is their retention, whatever the cost for others,
6116000	6119000	and that he's going to condone this continued problem.
6119000	6123000	It feels like Dream's in this position where he's always reluctant to say or even imply too much,
6123000	6125000	because he doesn't want his audience to read it as an attack on them,
6125000	6130000	while many want him to say more because they feel like it could prevent some of the anguish faced by those outside the fandom.
6130000	6132000	I know that's why people call it the Dream cycle,
6132000	6136000	but sometimes it's more important to notice the cycle of those you're interacting with as well,
6136000	6138000	and the greater cycle of behaviour.
6138000	6141000	It reached a point where it didn't matter who said what or what they did,
6141000	6143000	people linked it back to Dream and his fanbase,
6143000	6149000	which in turn made them defensive and instigated this endless palaver over Dream's responsibility as a creator,
6149000	6151000	one side wanting to hold him responsible for everything,
6151000	6154000	and the other for practically nothing, when the truth is a lot more grey.
6154000	6159000	You really need to look at how Dream mobilises his haters as well as his fans.
6184000	6189000	On one hand, you have the Minecraft community, the speedrunning community,
6189000	6192000	these people who care a lot about their game and the respect for their game.
6192000	6195000	Dream straight up told them that he doesn't really care for Minecraft,
6195000	6199000	while being one of the main benefactors and faces of the game's resurgence.
6199000	6202000	He regularly posts comments in the sections of videos that were critical of him,
6202000	6205000	sometimes they were composed, other times, not so much.
6205000	6208000	This made more and more enemies out of prospectively neutral parties,
6208000	6213000	particularly in the commentary genre, who are often frothing in the mouth for YouTuber controversies and subpar responses.
6213000	6216000	And to be honest, Dream never did anything overly offensive,
6216000	6220000	he just pissed people off, and then didn't really address why he pissed people off.
6220000	6223000	A lot of his gestures felt perfunctory, and his activism felt performative.
6223000	6226000	Stans may be happy that Dream regularly agreed with them,
6226000	6229000	but people outside that circle just felt it was fraudulent.
6229000	6232000	Dream provoked his adversaries, the adversaries provoked Dream.
6232000	6234000	The difference is that Dream never apologised to them,
6234000	6238000	even when he may have acted out of line, reason being due to this cycle.
6238000	6241000	Dream didn't feel the need to apologise to people who already hated him,
6241000	6244000	so when he apologised to his audience for the smallest of transgressions,
6244000	6247000	people thought Dream was giving them special treatment, which of course he was,
6247000	6251000	but it just increased that desire to call him out on a continuous basis.
6251000	6254000	It wasn't just a dream cycle, it was a general cycle.
6254000	6258000	People that are younger and stuff, some people have comprehension issues,
6258000	6260000	some people have a harder time understanding things.
6260000	6265000	I try and be... you're probably not used to it as much as I am,
6265000	6269000	so I kind of recognise when I say things, I try and say them in a way that can be consumed by the most people,
6269000	6273000	and understood that way, it's like, okay, there's no misinterpretations, right?
6273000	6275000	Yeah, I'm...
6275000	6276000	It's just different styles.
6276000	6280000	Yet, often the Stans receive the backlash as well for being the ones to complain,
6280000	6282000	and although, as I said at the start,
6282000	6285000	Stans have a much greater independent consciousness than a typical fanbase,
6285000	6289000	I don't think there's anything wrong with that, I just disagree with them sometimes.
6289000	6293000	It's not their fault that Dream regularly apologised to them when they pointed out
6293000	6295000	that Dream had said or done something that had bothered them,
6295000	6298000	whether I personally believe they were writing that or not.
6298000	6302000	A lot of people resented Stans for even raising a lot of these issues at all,
6302000	6305000	when in reality, they were doing exactly what other communities were doing
6305000	6307000	when Dream said something that bothered them.
6307000	6310000	The difference was that they could solicit an apology because they were on his side,
6310000	6311000	they were tactful.
6311000	6314000	When there was a problem, they'd frame it through the lens of education,
6314000	6316000	which made it a lot easier for Dream to respond to.
6316000	6319000	They were also fairly small issues, making them easier to correct.
6319000	6321000	Their greatest weakness was being too passively appeased,
6321000	6325000	but at the same time, they're a fanbase, what can you expect?
6325000	6327000	I'm glad we could clear the air that way.
6327000	6331000	Fans who have nothing to do with the situation wouldn't be at each other's throats.
6331000	6335000	In his apologies, Dream never addressed the fact that he's just a provocative person,
6335000	6338000	that he clearly has tendencies rooted in that rather proud mindset,
6338000	6342000	and so it just kept happening again and again and again.
6342000	6344000	The apologies were born mostly at convenience,
6344000	6347000	and even if he learned a bit more social awareness here and there,
6347000	6350000	he didn't seem to garner self-awareness for his own position as a powerful creator
6350000	6352000	whose words can hold a lot of weight.
6352000	6355000	I think a lot of people blame Stan Gulch primarily for this,
6355000	6357000	and Dream secondarily for enabling it,
6357000	6360000	but funnily enough, I think I've come to the opposite conclusion.
6360000	6362000	Allow me to explain why.
6362000	6365000	People weren't that critical of what I had to say,
6365000	6369000	so if you feel bad about you tweeting and then deleting it
6369000	6371000	and then having people come over here...
6371000	6385000	I hope we can all broadly agree that a majority of Stans are not bad people.
6385000	6387000	I don't believe that, I don't think most people believe that.
6387000	6389000	However, the issue of question is the culture,
6389000	6393000	and even if it is a vocal minority, is the minority too vocal to ignore?
6393000	6397000	I bring the very typical religion analogy that many people tend to turn to when discussing these queries.
6397000	6400000	Religion as a whole has helped a lot of people,
6400000	6402000	but at the same time has caused a lot of harm in Greek.
6402000	6406000	Now, it shouldn't be invalidating any of the legitimate positive change that people derive from religion.
6406000	6410000	However, it's the philosophical question of whether we should settle for something so imperfect.
6410000	6414000	When Josh Padau tweeted in December, it wasn't an attack on any specific Stans,
6414000	6416000	it was an attack on Stan culture as a whole.
6416000	6419000	His perspective seemed to focus on collectivism and the toxic ramifications
6419000	6423000	of what he described as prioritising group cohesion over the rights of the individual.
6423000	6427000	Now, I've already spoken about the problems with the deficit of critical thinking that can occur in these circles,
6427000	6432000	I do want to break down this discourse one more time to fully arbitrate a fair outlook on the nature of Stans.
6432000	6437000	Josh's theories of statements are a fair bit to unpack and I'm not going to discuss at all,
6437000	6440000	but in essence what he's saying is that Dream Twitter and other Stan Twitters
6440000	6444000	extract the identity of the individual in the desire for a greater cause,
6444000	6449000	in this case the example of the cause is Dream, and the devoted support for him in all his pursuits.
6449000	6452000	He believes that this behaviour is the product of unhealthy mindsets,
6452000	6454000	and instead of people finding help these issues,
6454000	6459000	it is promoted in the confines of these obsessive communities with other people who are also suffering,
6459000	6462000	vicariously living through an idol's achievements and occasional shortcomings.
6462000	6466000	These people may feel better for the moment, but is it the best solution for them
6466000	6470000	when there are other notable drawbacks for people inside and outside of these communities?
6470000	6474000	Just because something may seem like a broad net positive, should we not try to do better?
6474000	6478000	Now, Josh didn't always put this quite as tactfully as I have, but that's the gist of his thesis.
6478000	6481000	Does he have a point? Is Stan culture inherently toxic?
6481000	6483000	Can you resolve something that is systemically corrupt?
6483000	6488000	And where do Dream and his Stans factor into this specific philosophy?
6488000	6494000	Collectivism is a prickly subject, because I think it's hard to find someone who is truly above being part of some sort of collective,
6494000	6496000	as well as being influenced by it.
6496000	6502000	It's seldom absolute, and I don't doubt that a lot of Stans have their own personalities, beliefs, and identities,
6502000	6506000	so it's really about looking at everything we've discussed today and trying to establish what is human nature,
6506000	6510000	and what is exceptional, and on the surface, I'd say a lot of this is human nature.
6510000	6514000	However, I think the most defining feature of Stan groups, as opposed to normal fans,
6514000	6518000	is that they do have a nature to assemble in a way that can bring mass momentum,
6518000	6521000	and sometimes this is a good thing, but it can also be quite overwhelming.
6521000	6527000	In the olden glory days of YouTube, fans never really had that platform to organise in such a way,
6527000	6529000	and therefore retained some perception of independence,
6529000	6536000	but yet the increasing interconnectivity between platforms and Twitter have enabled the assembly and growth of these communities.
6536000	6542000	The evidence we've reviewed today shows that there is plenty of toxic YouTube behaviour that probably isn't just Stan's.
6542000	6547000	That's an omnipresent feature of YouTube, but what we see is a synchronisation of behaviour,
6547000	6552000	a consensus, a camaraderie, which can sometimes override that own critical process.
6552000	6559000	To me, Standom is just an outcome of fandom on a more macro level, and that can be demonstrated elsewhere.
6559000	6563000	I understand how somebody that isn't a creator might feel creepy if someone does this to them,
6563000	6565000	like they had a profile picture with your face on it or something,
6565000	6570000	but to a creator it's no different to a celebrity, or a football player, or any popular figure.
6570000	6576000	Dream already discussed this in his own video, comparing the nature of Stan's to those of very dedicated sports fans,
6576000	6579000	and in some ways, it's not an undeserved comparison.
6579000	6582000	People live through their sporting heroes at any age,
6582000	6589000	and people can become far too invested to the point where you could reliably say that they indulge in behaviour that does not represent their idols,
6589000	6591000	particularly when they're in large groups.
6591000	6597000	Hooliganism in the name of factualism, to a much worse degree, is not a rare occurrence in these circles.
6597000	6600000	However, I think there is a key difference, one that we've kind of dabbled in already,
6600000	6603000	but not with the level of responsibility that it probably carries,
6603000	6607000	and that simple fact is that these sporting legends don't live online.
6607000	6610000	This isn't to say that they can't be negatively affected by fans, and honestly,
6610000	6614000	comparing your Standom to sports fans is not the most flattering thing one can do.
6614000	6617000	However, when it all gets too much for them, they can close down their PC,
6617000	6622000	comfortable in the thought that the decision they just made won't greatly affect their ability to perform their job.
6622000	6627000	It's not the same with YouTubers, this level of dedication wasn't really designed to exist in the online sphere,
6627000	6631000	and I think at a time where mental health is so delicate amongst content creators,
6631000	6637000	Stan's don't necessarily help a situation, even if they're not trying to necessarily stir stuff up,
6637000	6640000	particularly when they're emotionally involved to the point where people feel overwhelmed,
6640000	6645000	or they decide to take up a cause against a singular or limited party all at once.
6645000	6649000	This is not exceptional either though, but Dream Stands have been made out of an example,
6649000	6655000	they're a very visible target, and they allow for creators to craft a digestible narrative around a familiar subject,
6655000	6660000	but it's also their presence. In a way, their rise was almost as sudden as Dream in mid 2020,
6660000	6663000	and you're going to cause a bit of whiplash when that happens.
6663000	6668000	They're not the worst, I know creators and music critics who have received far greater help from some of their subjects' fanatics,
6669000	6676000	but Dream Stands' position as YouTuber enthusiast means that any fallout of incidents is felt more intensely for some people.
6676000	6681000	Although seemingly experiencing the whiplash at first as well, Dream has acclimated to it and embraced it,
6681000	6685000	sometimes though a bit too much. Private Twitter is with hundreds of thousands of followers,
6685000	6689000	calling his fans kittens, the love bombings, situations we've already discussed.
6689000	6695000	They promote this sense of parasocial intimacy that is obviously going to make people more attached to you whether you mean to or not.
6695000	6699000	Make no mistake, I don't think it's wrong to extend love and kindness to those in your fanbase,
6699000	6705000	but I think you can do it in ways that also doesn't promote this illusion of closeness that makes people more committed than they need to be.
6705000	6712000	If stands of other public figures have shown, as a force of influence, you don't need to feed the beast too regularly to guarantee its loyalty.
6712000	6719000	So with this in mind, would some of us derive greater benefit from returning to the more individual, independent-based sense of fandom?
6719000	6724000	Yes, I don't think you should undermine the negative experience, even if it is a minority.
6724000	6730000	We've seen that a small group of people can still wield a lot of power, and even when it's not intended to be negative,
6730000	6737000	there can be real negative ramifications. Life probably would be a lot more of a peaceful journey for many of us without this.
6737000	6741000	However, this is more than just us, what benefits these people?
6741000	6747000	Josh really tried to hammer home the point that the people in these groups are just exacerbating their own mental illnesses,
6747000	6751000	and I don't know how I feel about that point, I really tried to think about it.
6751000	6758000	Maybe in a few years time, when it's clear, we'll be able to analyse the actual outcome of stand culture as people get older and move on from this,
6758000	6762000	but a community for a lot of people can take them out of a very dark place,
6762000	6770000	and sometimes a better support group is the first step to helping yourself out of that pit, maybe in a way that other outlets can't.
6770000	6774000	This shouldn't negate the harm that's been inflicted onto people, and I never want to do that.
6774000	6776000	Harassment is never acceptable.
6776000	6781000	Clearly some people just don't feel like they have the breathing space they once did with older audiences,
6781000	6787000	and I don't think people like Josh make their arguments with bad faith, I believe they're rooted in legitimate experience.
6787000	6790000	The question is, can you remove the bad without removing the good?
6790000	6794000	Is it always doomed to fail and leave us worse off than we have been before?
6794000	6799000	At the start of this part, I mention religion, and although there are some parallels, there are also great differences,
6799000	6804000	and whereas religion in many ways is deeply rooted to the point that we struggle to effect societal change around it,
6804000	6807000	I'd like to think that stand culture isn't past that point.
6807000	6812000	One glaring difference is that we actually have a contemporary figure at the centre of this drama
6812000	6818000	who can speak openly and positively influence communities who will listen to him, Dream himself.
6824000	6827000	The best argument for Dream's position, outside of everything we've already discussed,
6827000	6833000	is that a lot of these situations just are not big deals, and to be frank, Dream would be completely entitled to adopt this position.
6833000	6837000	Even the Minecraft situation was only a big deal because he made it a big deal,
6837000	6843000	otherwise it would have had very few negative implications, and it still didn't for his status as a creator.
6843000	6848000	Many claimed his own stands expected too much of him politically, which I think is a valid point.
6848000	6851000	These people became famous through playing Minecraft, not for their social activism.
6851000	6854000	There's only one key factor to his detriment though,
6854000	6859000	the fact that he already addressed things that were fundamentally not big deals again and again and again,
6859000	6864000	and tried to involve himself on these matters, and validated everyone's concerns with his behaviour.
6864000	6871000	After all the high-stakes stuff, it feels strange that this drama has probably had the most people talking given how minor it could hypothetically be.
6871000	6877000	A lot of people place the responsibility for Dream's softening due to this idea of hostile stands,
6877000	6883000	but I don't think that's the entire picture. Do stands care too much about stuff that I think personally is rather relevant?
6883000	6889000	Yeah, that's my opinion, but it's Dream's decision to also care and endorse a culture that can be unhealthy.
6889000	6892000	I can't say I'm a massive stan of anyone myself, sorry J. Aubrey,
6892000	6897000	but I think its evolution as a phrase is something a lot less harmful today than the one it was originally created.
6897000	6901000	I do think that a significant portion of these communities are pretty amiable,
6901000	6906000	most want to focus on positivity and supporting a creator they look up to, with the occasional dabbling in social justice.
6906000	6909000	Are there bad stands? Definitely, and I might mention them in a bit,
6909000	6917000	but I'd say Dream stands on the whole are probably milder than a lot of other stands for more mainstream artists who can be very unpleasant.
6917000	6921000	I don't think stan culture at its core is a rotten philosophy,
6921000	6926000	I don't think many people really provided too much substantial evidence to back this idea.
6926000	6931000	I think one of the universal downsides to being a stan or a fan is that it does sometimes compromise your ability to think critically
6931000	6935000	in pursuit of your desire to seek validation from the creator that you admire.
6935000	6942000	Equally, I think it's allowed an us vs them idea to take precedence which has allowed some real concerning behaviour to seep into the fanbases.
6942000	6948000	To this day, Dream is tweeting out to remind the haters how bad they actually are, how they're so much worse than the stans,
6948000	6952000	and I don't know if I need to remind anyone, but it's not a competition.
6952000	6955000	Even if this statement was true, it does not help at all,
6955000	6961000	creating this image of a greater evil only serves to pit people against each other further and validate deleterious behaviour.
6961000	6965000	My friend Cordwood, another creator who has covered this topic, went through a pretty rough time last year,
6965000	6970000	during a lot of drama relating to John Swan and other individuals in the community that was generally not his fault.
6970000	6976000	During this, some of the messages that he received from people who identified themselves as stans were truly vile,
6976000	6981000	and I understand that there will always be bad apples, but tell me, is this normal?
6981000	6983000	It doesn't feel normal to me.
6983000	6986000	Should we calculate who's worse? Does that aid the situation?
6986000	6990000	How would someone who's not an experienced creator deal with this level of hatred?
6990000	6994000	The truth is, I don't think Dream or his stans really did anything heinous at the start,
6994000	6999000	I think he probably could have been a bit more vocal about what sort of behaviour from his audiences he viewed as acceptable,
6999000	7004000	and I feel he was always focused on defending one point of view rather than looking at the bigger picture,
7004000	7007000	but there's always a proportion of viewers who will be beyond your control.
7007000	7012000	A lot of the time, the size of Dream's audience amplifies some of the negative experiences of other creators,
7012000	7016000	I think the real problem comes with Dream's own personality in dealing with these situations.
7017000	7020000	His tweets on the question of his stans were subpar responses,
7020000	7025000	in my opinion, it was definitely what his stans wanted to hear, but it wasn't what they needed to hear.
7025000	7029000	I think people may have been overreacting to a degree and fixating on a few negative experiences,
7029000	7033000	but Dream's own handling often left people feeling like he was taking the piss out of them,
7033000	7037000	like, ooooh Dream, funny accountable tweet, come on man.
7037000	7040000	By the time he came around and uploaded a video or thread explaining what he really meant,
7040000	7045000	people had already made up their own minds, because it's easier to go with a sentence long tweet than watch a 10 minute video,
7045000	7048000	it's easier to go with a provocative image of a person than a nuanced one,
7048000	7051000	and that does not help when the person is inherently provocative.
7051000	7057000	Dream dropped into conversations that dared to name drop him and bestow his occasionally heedless wisdom onto them as well.
7057000	7061000	In spite of claiming to realise the responsibility that he wielded with such a committed audience,
7061000	7064000	he'd regularly just use social media without care for the actual consequences,
7064000	7067000	against people who called him out, against people who challenged him,
7067000	7070000	despite the fact that many people had complained about his stans for that exact issue,
7070000	7074000	inflicting this continuous narrative where people stated that they were experiencing harassment from his viewers,
7074000	7077000	and then Dream would pop up to rub salt in the wound.
7077000	7080000	That leads you to the apex in these shenanigans, the speedrunning situation,
7080000	7086000	one where Dream actively fed propaganda and half-truths to his viewers which caused torture by his own admission,
7086000	7089000	and when I say half-truths, I don't know whether he knew he cheated or not at the time,
7089000	7094000	but I do know that he claimed without any basis at all that the motivations of these mods were self-serving,
7094000	7098000	and had nothing to do with the actual mathematical probabilities that they were arguing,
7098000	7100000	which he clearly knew were contentious.
7100000	7105000	If you feed that content to devoted followers, then how do you expect them to react?
7105000	7109000	You can't be blamed necessarily when people act in a way that doesn't reflect your demeanour as a creator,
7109000	7113000	but if you're angry, other people are gonna be angry, and then other people are gonna bear the brunt of it.
7113000	7118000	Dream actively defended his audience, then immediately followed it, unintentionally or not, by using them as a battering ram.
7118000	7121000	Others then responded angrily, and Dream defended his audience,
7121000	7125000	while most people see it as Dream pandering to his stans, I also feel there's something personal to it,
7125000	7129000	because given the fact that Dream has at points caused situations with his own behaviour,
7129000	7134000	his defence of stans would make sense, because if he didn't then he'd be conceding that his own actions were out of line as well,
7134000	7139000	to give preferential treatment was the smartest decision, it's just obviously also a divisive one.
7139000	7143000	Stans didn't really call Dream out on it, because their perspectives were compromised in a sense,
7143000	7146000	and given that they benefit from it, there isn't really much cause to.
7146000	7149000	Especially on Twitter, stans probably felt like they had been given a hard time,
7149000	7154000	so many creators had used generalised and vague language to condemn the behaviour of a few,
7154000	7157000	and even though I'd say the YouTubers were justified in doing so,
7157000	7161000	I think it always made stans a bit sensitive over their image as obsessive outcasts.
7161000	7167000	Dream's defence was a breath of fresh air, it was a sign of solidarity, Dream and his stans against the world.
7167000	7172000	I think solidarity has its risk though, because it becomes an umbrella for all sorts of people,
7172000	7175000	and I think in a way the toxicity became a self-fulfilling prophecy,
7175000	7178000	where many used the whole guise of Dream defence to be obnoxious and cruel.
7178000	7183000	Some who I doubt were even that committed in supporting Dream, but found a space for their own exploits.
7183000	7187000	This has led to doxing, harassment, and a variety of other things that are clearly documented,
7187000	7192000	not just against Dream's critics, not just against creators in Dream's circle, but Dream himself.
7192000	7197000	He hasn't exactly benefited from this, but every time the damage becomes clearer, people seem to blame him more.
7197000	7202000	This isn't aided by the fact that a lot of his responses are only re-remembered for how he defends himself,
7202000	7204000	because that's the primary narrative of them.
7204000	7207000	These groups, it's easier to maintain a culture of silence, because too many times,
7207000	7212000	people don't want to admit they're flawed given the divisive narrative, but that can be dangerous.
7212000	7215000	This is coming from me, who I've been knee-deep in terms of Twitter,
7215000	7220000	and really deep into the community of what most people would say are stans,
7220000	7223000	and I think that there's very- it's such a small minority.
7223000	7229000	When you mention a drawing gore or whatever, I've seen two drawings of that that have been mentioned before, ever.
7229000	7233000	And when you're talking about me with 18 million subscribers and millions of followers on Twitter,
7233000	7237000	and like you said, tons of interactions and everything, two? Ever? That I've seen?
7237000	7241000	I'm sure there's probably more, but from what I've seen, two ever,
7241000	7244000	that's mostly from people posting and saying, oh, look how gross this is, or whatever.
7244000	7247000	I would assume that that makes- that it's a very small community.
7247000	7251000	Just look at the private communities that have sprouted, where some partake in truly detestable behaviours.
7251000	7255000	I don't really want to go into detail, because I've spoken about this stuff enough before,
7255000	7257000	and the mainstream communities clearly don't endorse it,
7257000	7260000	but people struggle to know exactly what to do about it.
7260000	7262000	I don't know why, but it feels so good!
7265000	7268000	Ninja, let's- let's- let's have that talk.
7268000	7271000	Hey, hey, hey, hey, call me Ninja!
7271000	7276000	Hey, yeah, I feel like I might be a little- a little more peachy than you, Ninja.
7276000	7280000	You seem to be pushing the boundaries of comedy, Ninja, I'm 16.
7280000	7283000	Dreamers also may not pan joke or two, which bring rather poor taste,
7283000	7285000	and these normally wouldn't hold too much weight,
7285000	7289000	but it's once again that sort of thoughtlessness that can be taken out of context
7289000	7293000	by legitimately bad actors to validate doing things that are truly awful,
7293000	7296000	because they will look for any form of justification possible.
7296000	7299000	I feel that some people don't want to be too vocal about this stuff
7299000	7303000	because they don't want to validate narratives of people who do tie these fringe communities
7303000	7304000	to the central Dream Twitter.
7304000	7307000	Nobody wants to yield ground, and that can have serious implications
7307000	7310000	when there are nasty, unwanted growths inside your camp.
7310000	7313000	People can probably do more than they have been doing, to be honest.
7313000	7317000	Factions end up arguing over whether these individuals are representative of the community,
7317000	7320000	rather than how to get rid of them, it doesn't matter who they represent.
7320000	7322000	If you want to get rid of them, you're on the same side,
7322000	7326000	I'd hope that if people work together on bringing that stuff to Twitter's attention,
7326000	7328000	maybe something more could be done.
7328000	7332000	However, that's merely a footnote in this belated saga.
7332000	7334000	What would I say to the big man himself?
7339000	7342000	But almost every single thing that I see brought up regarding stans
7342000	7345000	is just completely false, or very, very out of context.
7345000	7348000	In my opinion, people who expect Dream to turn on his audience
7348000	7350000	are probably asking a bit too much,
7350000	7354000	but I think there is definitely a change in dynamic that would benefit everyone online.
7354000	7356000	Dream is obviously against toxic behaviour,
7356000	7358000	and I think that's completely fair of him,
7358000	7361000	but I feel it would be even more helpful to just try and lower the stakes
7361000	7363000	if he talks shit on such a regular basis,
7363000	7365000	or just not talk shit at all.
7365000	7368000	I think people struggle to grapple with the context behind his mindset
7368000	7370000	when he makes a lot of his comments,
7370000	7372000	and when he's called out for it by the right people, he'll backtrack,
7372000	7374000	but not really explain why he said what he said,
7374000	7376000	which is clearly an impulsivity problem,
7376000	7380000	an assumption that people who don't like what he does have bad intentions,
7380000	7383000	an impression that he has passed on to his stan community,
7383000	7385000	which can lead to the strangest of altercations.
7385000	7387000	There was a rather surreal situation recently
7387000	7390000	when stans began to stigmatise a group of British creators
7390000	7392000	for not wearing masks at a private party,
7392000	7394000	and then, on top of this, for some reason,
7394000	7398000	Dream decided to weigh in with likely the most weirdly centrist take of all time,
7398000	7402000	rambling about viral loads like he knew what the term meant.
7402000	7404000	Not only was his statement extremely questionable,
7404000	7406000	but I literally have no clue what his source was
7406000	7411000	to throw suspicion on the vaccine's ability to influence viral loads.
7411000	7415000	The studies on this topic are still in a rather early phase
7415000	7418000	and certainly don't provide a consensus that supports his claim.
7418000	7422000	This sort of content is far more dangerous in this environment
7422000	7424000	than a group of vaccinated and tested friends
7424000	7425000	who see each other all the time
7425000	7428000	choosing not to wear masks at a private event.
7428000	7431000	But then again, Dream's tweet felt like this stretch
7431000	7434000	to justify a very strangely targeted reaction
7434000	7436000	to people arguably being more responsible
7436000	7438000	than a majority of the British population.
7438000	7440000	Unless you're willing to write a tweet longer,
7440000	7444000	going through all the nuances of COVID response, epidemiology and human behaviour,
7444000	7447000	then maybe it's best just not to say anything.
7447000	7450000	One of the greatest problems, particularly with online stan culture,
7450000	7452000	is this nature to assume.
7452000	7454000	And I don't think there's anything inherently wrong with assumptions
7454000	7456000	when you don't know everything.
7456000	7459000	But you have to work with the fact that you may be ignorant,
7459000	7463000	rather than being overconfident in details that may not be as one-sided
7463000	7466000	as you see them through a picture or a tweet about a picture.
7466000	7470000	Sometimes Dream just seems too desperate to appease his own audience
7470000	7474000	while still attempting to be apologetic to those who've received unnecessary backlash
7474000	7477000	and here it just came across as an absolute mess,
7477000	7480000	possibly pushing misinformation about a very serious illness
7480000	7482000	and what we should be doing to combat it.
7482000	7486000	I'm going to leave some studies here and not say any more.
7486000	7489000	Thank you for all the congratulations, guys. 25 million. Let's go.
7489000	7491000	And you know what? With Dream's monumental growth,
7491000	7494000	I can understand how all the attention, both positive and negative,
7494000	7495000	must be a bit overwhelming.
7495000	7497000	The situations where he's been unfairly stitched up,
7497000	7500000	incidents where he's been called out but done very little wrong.
7500000	7503000	Unfortunately for Dream, some haters are going to come with the territory.
7503000	7507000	Alongside the success and the stance, it's your job not to provoke that.
7507000	7511000	The Sans themselves have shared their fair portion of controversy,
7511000	7514000	and with their own consciousness does come a degree of accountability on them.
7514000	7518000	Throughout most of 2020, I don't think you could say that any YouTuber
7518000	7520000	was singly responsible for the actions of their Stans.
7520000	7523000	I think that people just need to lay down clear ground rules
7523000	7527000	and a way to actually keep people who don't respect them away from the communities
7527000	7529000	and sometimes the platform altogether.
7529000	7531000	To be fair, many have done that since.
7531000	7534000	There are some what people call boundary pages for creators
7534000	7538000	and these communities do try to define Stans by people who respect those boundaries.
7538000	7542000	At the same time, it's still down to creators who foster a close relationship with their Stans
7542000	7546000	to make sure there aren't scapegoats to act outside those boundaries.
7546000	7548000	Dream does deserve the capacity to be himself,
7548000	7551000	but there are also new responsibilities that come with his position.
7551000	7554000	I think anyone with his status would be given the same expectations.
7554000	7557000	At the same time, Stans do need to realise that,
7557000	7559000	even if he does say the right thing sometimes,
7559000	7561000	has his moments of clarity and morality,
7561000	7566000	that he is a gamer raised in a gamer country and he may have his gamer moments.
7566000	7568000	You don't need to take up his cause when he does,
7568000	7570000	he's large enough to defend himself on many matters
7570000	7574000	and the inclusion of more parties only complicates a lot of these problems
7574000	7576000	and it bitters those involved.
7576000	7579000	Dream erupted onto the scene in a whirlwind of hype and expectation,
7579000	7582000	but was clearly confronted with numerous challenges
7582000	7584000	and corresponding judgement from millions online.
7584000	7587000	With the internet as it was, many of these people likely did exist
7587000	7591000	to drop a hot take on Dream like they knew anything about him and move on.
7591000	7594000	Within the fray though, Dream found support from those also under siege,
7594000	7598000	in his own stand-up, becoming tired at the hip due to that shared persecution complex,
7598000	7601000	a complex that wasn't completely unfounded.
7601000	7604000	As a general philosophy though, it was deeply thought,
7604000	7606000	because amongst those too harsh on him,
7606000	7608000	there was valuable criticism worth listening to
7608000	7610000	and clearly evidence behaviour that should have been curbed.
7610000	7613000	Generalisations from both sides culminated in this pointless war
7613000	7618000	over people's reputations like the matters they were even based on was worth arguing over.
7618000	7620000	But sometimes you just need someone to say,
7620000	7622000	hey, we should focus on the real enemy here,
7622000	7625000	because it's not about if a general group of people are good and bad,
7625000	7629000	often it's about ridding ourselves of the bad and retaining the good.
7629000	7631000	That's not just the route to community improvement,
7631000	7633000	it's the route to personal self-improvement.
7633000	7636000	If you look at all the terrible stuff going on in a community and say,
7636000	7640000	that proves the community is bad, I win, you're not really helping anyone.
7640000	7643000	Even if you believe these cultures are inherently toxic,
7643000	7646000	you can't deny the fact that there are a lot of people in these communities
7646000	7648000	who deserve more help than hate.
7648000	7651000	Going forward, I hope Dream is more careful with his words,
7651000	7653000	or at least more conscious of how they may affect people.
7653000	7656000	Additionally, I think it'd be fair to actually apologise to those he's affected in the past,
7656000	7658000	regardless of whether they hate him or not.
7658000	7660000	Stan's not your usual fans,
7660000	7663000	and they can be a bit harder to handle and control as a large creator,
7663000	7667000	and Dream can't be expected to own every action of someone who's carried away in their devotion.
7667000	7670000	At the same time, if you want to advocate for them and retain them,
7670000	7673000	then you do possess some responsibility for what they may do in your name.
7673000	7677000	You need to make sure that misconduct is part of the exception rather than the rule,
7677000	7680000	and isn't linked to Stan culture at its core, like some have claimed.
7681000	7683000	Additionally, even if you disagree with those people,
7683000	7687000	their opinions are rooted in some experience, so don't go dismissing it too readily.
7687000	7691000	I hope that Stan's also realised that support sometimes means being aware
7691000	7695000	of how the person you're supporting is fundamentally flawed beyond just their politics,
7695000	7699000	and making sure they make responsible decisions for how they conduct themselves.
7699000	7703000	If you see too much of yourself in them, then they may be doing something wrong,
7703000	7705000	because they're in a very different position to you.
7705000	7709000	Stan's could well have a positive influence on Dream and the actions that he takes,
7709000	7711000	it's just important to actually identify the problem,
7711000	7713000	something that I feel hasn't really been done up until now.
7713000	7716000	As much as Dream has misused his power on occasions,
7716000	7718000	Stan's do possess their own consciousness,
7718000	7722000	and they can use that loyalty to make sure that Dream plays fair like the rest of us,
7722000	7725000	and tones down the behaviour that has instigated these situations.
7725000	7727000	Dream is receptive to his own audience,
7727000	7730000	and that receptiveness doesn't just have to be limited to social issues.
7730000	7733000	However, the standard won't be the only ones within the discourse,
7733000	7736000	and I hope other communities can hone in their criticism as well,
7736000	7738000	because they have a unique insight to offer,
7738000	7740000	and don't just serve to feed the divide.
7740000	7742000	It's always easier to listen to someone who's on your side,
7742000	7744000	even if they should be listening regardless,
7744000	7747000	and if you believe in human decency and doing the right thing,
7747000	7749000	then you may be more alike than you think.
7749000	7752000	As for everyone else, I think we'll have to get used to Dream,
7752000	7754000	because if one thing's been shown in the last year,
7754000	7758000	it's that whether by design or fortune, he does have a bit of a staying now.
7758000	7760000	He's certainly been in less drama in the past few months to say the least,
7760000	7762000	which is good news,
7762000	7765000	but when you have two entities of great influence and volatility,
7765000	7767000	the drama is never far away.
7767000	7770000	But maybe that's because no one's taking their normal pills anymore.
