00:00.000 --> 00:09.780
Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time,

00:09.780 --> 00:16.580
and many of you are likely well acquainted with my established status as a gamer, in fact probably one of the best gamers there is out there.

00:16.580 --> 00:22.820
Truth is, I only don't compete in tournaments because I'd really hate to put any of these so-called competitive players out of a job,

00:22.820 --> 00:26.860
especially when I am so blessed to have alternative sources of entertainment.

00:26.920 --> 00:32.460
Yes, my field of interest isn't merely restricted to one meadow. You see, like most people, I love a good mystery,

00:32.460 --> 00:38.460
and today we have nothing less than one of the online world's strangest happenings, one that has baffled observers,

00:38.460 --> 00:41.920
and even after its resolution, left far more questions than answers.

00:41.920 --> 00:49.060
Nonetheless, whereas most of our topics are embroilments on our resident platform, we have to turn our attention to our YouTube's contemporaries,

00:49.060 --> 00:53.220
and dare I say it, competitors for today's situation, Twitch.

00:53.340 --> 00:59.660
Twitch, like YouTube, is a video sharing platform, where one can tune in to their favourite creators and view various genres of content.

00:59.660 --> 01:05.900
However, unlike YouTube, Twitch's format prioritises live streams, which often provides more direct interaction between a creator,

01:05.900 --> 01:12.420
the content, and their audience. It's fair to say that YouTube also offers this feature, and most people have taken advantage of it at some point,

01:12.420 --> 01:18.700
however as YouTube isn't thought to provide the same attention to it that Twitch does, most tend to opt the latter when it comes to streaming.

01:18.740 --> 01:23.740
With that said, Twitch isn't without its issues either, many of which have been on display in the last few years,

01:23.740 --> 01:28.220
particularly their policy which has often led to accusations of hypocrisy and double standards.

01:31.820 --> 01:38.540
Now with these large platforms, some sort of double standard is inevitable, particularly given the special treatment that larger creators have been known to afford.

01:38.540 --> 01:45.820
With that said, Twitch's attempts to find any consistency have often led to criticisms of the opposite, and their nature to double down hasn't helped that.

01:45.820 --> 01:51.580
I'm not going to detail each individual example because we'd be here all year, and that's a bit longer than I want to make my video,

01:51.580 --> 01:57.740
but their lack of transparency on the matter has left some streamers believing they've been indefinitely banned for the most milk toast of faux pas,

01:57.740 --> 02:03.460
and in the live stream business where there are no editing tools between the video and the viewer, that can be risky business.

02:03.460 --> 02:11.220
On the other hand though, there are platform darlings, who have been welcomed back despite multiple breaches of their supposed all encompassing creator guidelines.

02:11.300 --> 02:14.420
For many, there's unfairness, and then there's Twitch.

02:14.420 --> 02:20.980
There are fair few theories about why Twitch is so wildly inconsistent, but I think the most deeply rooted one is that simply put, they're a business.

02:20.980 --> 02:26.580
They need to hold onto the main sources of that business, especially when there are alternative platforms offering the same service.

02:26.580 --> 02:33.380
If they went and banned their biggest names, even if it was for good reason, those names may just migrate to a competitor who will tolerate their antics,

02:33.380 --> 02:40.500
taking all their audience and income with them. Even if it leads to greater moral inconsistency, their current practice keeps their platform afloat,

02:40.500 --> 02:47.860
which is probably their prime concern. However, at the core of this pretty logically sound explanation, there is one rather significant exception to that rule,

02:47.860 --> 02:51.060
so I think it's high time to introduce our title character.

02:51.060 --> 03:20.180
This is Doctor Disrespect, he's a streamer with a pretty significant recurrent following, he's mostly known for playing shooters,

03:20.180 --> 03:27.300
although he's not too fussy, and will play whatever takes his fancy, really. In a way, he doesn't need to specialise, because over the years, his success hasn't

03:27.300 --> 03:35.700
necessarily been attributed to his in-game performance, not that it is lacking. More so, though, his on-screen persona, with a defined brand and attire to match.

03:35.700 --> 03:42.740
He's always been a bit of a gamer, though, even claiming to have won Blockbuster video game tournaments in 93 and 94, back in the day.

03:42.740 --> 03:56.100
I'm sitting there at the Blockbuster World Championships at Marine World in Vallejo, California, 200 tube TVs lined up, right, on all these tables, right?

03:56.100 --> 04:08.260
Maybe a couple hundred people, maybe just kind of walking around the area, not sure what's going on, but it was probably the first LAN event slash tournament in the history of video games.

04:09.220 --> 04:17.380
However, gaming hasn't been his only interest. In 2005, he graduated Cal Poly with a degree in business and marketing management, with a stint in the college basketball team.

04:17.380 --> 04:25.380
In the years following, he dabbled in gaming, but began working behind the scenes at video game company Sledgehammer, and a live streaming website known as Justin.tv,

04:25.380 --> 04:33.780
which had a pretty thriving gaming section at that time. However, in 2011, Justin TV decided to separate this section to a humble spin-off site known as Twitch,

04:33.860 --> 04:40.820
and well, the rest was history there. With experience in community management, gaming, and business with some of the most media-relevant companies,

04:40.820 --> 04:46.340
the doc decided to chance his arm on the other side of the stage curtains, to pretty resounding results.

04:46.340 --> 04:48.340
So the winner is...

04:48.340 --> 05:06.900
One thing when I started my channel, I had no idea what I was getting into. It was just having a good time. Let's just do our thing.

05:09.140 --> 05:11.700
But a year and a half later, I realized a lot of things.

05:12.580 --> 05:25.860
I've realized that I've provided an outlet for a lot of people that are dealing with a lot of hardships, and it makes me proud.

05:25.860 --> 05:30.580
In the years coming up to 2020, our trash-talking Twitter amassed a multi-million following,

05:30.580 --> 05:36.740
won numerous awards, acquired a variety of mainstream sponsorships and endorsements, and instituted himself as a force to be reckoned with.

05:36.820 --> 05:39.620
However, he was not entirely unproblematic in his time.

05:51.620 --> 05:58.660
Dr Disrespect was known for having a somewhat abrasive and even divisive persona, and in a way that makes sense, it's part of the appeal.

05:58.660 --> 06:07.220
Javi did occasionally straggle the line between abrasiveness and offensiveness, his outspoken nature often clashing with those who disagreed with him or held disdain for his comments.

06:07.220 --> 06:16.260
In 2019, he was suspended from Twitch for two weeks after he filmed inside a public restroom at the annual E3 convention, violating Twitch's own guidelines and California state law.

06:16.260 --> 06:22.980
In that case, following the restoration of his channel, some perceived Doc as part of the Twitch cabal that could never face real repercussions for their mishaps.

06:22.980 --> 06:29.940
As a creator with millions of followers and a cemented history at the company he represented, he was obviously going to possess some power in his channel's status.

06:29.940 --> 06:36.500
At its heart, it was a synergetic relationship, one that perhaps bent the rules a little, but worked for both of the interested parties.

06:36.500 --> 06:44.900
In an esports article, the author wryly commented that as long as he didn't stream from Bathroom again, it was safe to assume that the Doc won't be going anywhere in 2020.

06:45.780 --> 06:47.540
How wrong they were.

06:47.540 --> 06:56.340
And I'll just say this right now, champs. There's a reason why we're suing the fuck out of them, okay?

06:56.340 --> 07:06.820
Yes, my friends, today's mystery will investigate the slaying and subsequent aftermath of one of Twitch's most recognisable creators, with discourse surrounding the many postulators that have arisen since that time.

07:06.820 --> 07:14.260
However, to fully understand many of these discussions, it's important that we first set the scene, so allow me to take you all back to a simpler time.

07:14.900 --> 07:18.420
2020. Yeah, I can't believe it was simpler than either.

07:18.420 --> 07:24.820
Don't get too nostalgic, as you join me to investigate the disappearance of Dr Disrespect.

07:24.820 --> 07:29.860
But you know what won't disappear? Your enjoyment of Rage Shadow Legends!

07:29.860 --> 07:40.180
Rage Shadow Legends is the best game ever made. With over 600 champions and riveting AAA gameplay, you'll love Rage Shadow Legends, millions of champion combinations and endless dungeons to run through.

07:40.180 --> 07:42.980
You will never need to play another game in your life.

07:42.980 --> 07:47.540
I stopped eating and sleeping, why bother? I have Raid now.

07:47.540 --> 07:56.100
And if you, somehow, get bored of raiding dungeons, you can beat the shit out of people in the PvP mode and become the Shadow Legend.

07:56.100 --> 08:05.780
My favourite Shadow Legends are Herndig, because he is a dwarf and he can nuke everyone. I also like Gorgorra, because I mean, come on, look at him!

08:05.780 --> 08:12.420
Gorbgorrib and Herndig are also married. Right now, Raid is hosting a spooky Halloween event.

08:12.420 --> 08:20.180
They have plenty of in-game and IRL prizes, like a 1000 Amazon gift card! You could buy Herndig a gift with that.

08:20.180 --> 08:28.660
The event only runs until November the 5th, so be sure to get the game! Go, go! What are you waiting for? Get it now!

08:28.660 --> 08:33.060
If you want to consume the most influential piece of media since Homer's Odyssey,

08:33.060 --> 08:40.660
then use this link in the description or the QR code screen to download the game and get a free starter pack worth $30!

08:40.660 --> 08:44.900
That's $30 you can spend on Herndig!

08:44.900 --> 08:50.820
You can find me raiding Shadow Legends in-game under the name The Left Opinion.

08:50.820 --> 09:00.020
And if you love Herndig enough, you may even be able to join my Herndig fan club clan! See you there, gamers!

09:20.820 --> 09:29.860
Now, I've already outlined the status of Dr Dispect at the start of 2020.

09:29.860 --> 09:34.180
He was creating content for adoring fans, and everything seemed fairly ordinary on that front.

09:34.180 --> 09:37.620
However, there had been some tension stirred between platforms around that time.

09:37.620 --> 09:43.620
I've already mentioned YouTube's streaming feature, but I also noted that, as opposed to Twitch, it wasn't their primary selling point.

09:43.620 --> 09:48.020
However, around this time, there was another player in the market, which had shook up the industry a little.

09:48.020 --> 09:50.020
The name of this player was Mixer.

09:50.020 --> 09:54.500
Mixer was a relatively new online service, launched in 2016 under the name Beam,

09:54.500 --> 09:58.020
not too long after it was brought by Microsoft and rebranded for the global stage.

09:58.020 --> 10:04.020
Microsoft harbored great ambitions with this platform, gradually expanding the range of available services, streaming included.

10:04.020 --> 10:10.020
Arguably, though, the most significant development was in 2019, when renowned streamer Ninja, or Tyler Blevins,

10:10.020 --> 10:13.300
announced he would be leaving Twitch to join Mixer on an exclusive deal.

10:13.300 --> 10:23.300
I know this may come as a shock to many of you, but as of today, I will be streaming exclusively on Mixer.

10:23.300 --> 10:27.540
This caused quite the commotion at the time, with many pointing the finger at a variety of sources,

10:27.540 --> 10:33.140
including Twitch themselves for supposedly harbouring a toxic environment that Blevins no longer wish to tolerate.

10:33.140 --> 10:36.340
Ninja was not the only streamer to leave Twitch for the market competitor, though.

10:36.340 --> 10:42.260
Among others, FPS streamers Shroud, Ewok, and Kinggothalian also migrated platforms on an exclusive deal,

10:42.260 --> 10:46.580
and in this time, Mixer reported a notable increase in hours of content streamed on their platform,

10:46.580 --> 10:50.420
appearing to win over new and aspiring creators from their rival streaming service.

10:50.420 --> 10:55.460
This would have inevitably put a squeeze on the bigwigs over at Twitch, with another platform to poach their creators,

10:55.460 --> 11:00.180
they would need to approach each controversy with a heightened sensitivity to the consequences of their decisions.

11:00.180 --> 11:04.660
This would obviously not be a popular decision with some, but with one of the tech behemoths breathing down their throat,

11:04.660 --> 11:06.660
it seemed like the only viable option.

11:06.660 --> 11:11.060
In the meantime, there were questions surrounding who the next big name would be, perhaps XQC,

11:11.060 --> 11:14.340
Pokimane, or maybe Dr Disrespect.

11:14.340 --> 11:17.620
Let's say a move for the doc to Mixer.

11:17.620 --> 11:24.580
Let's just like theoretically say, right, the number would have to be crazy.

11:26.260 --> 11:35.220
Like, I'm talking, I don't know what Ninja got, but it's got to be at Ninja's level or higher.

11:36.580 --> 11:38.580
I mean, it's just a stronger brand, right?

11:38.580 --> 11:46.020
It would have to be.

11:46.020 --> 11:49.300
In August's stream, he appeared to have little regard for what platform he streamed on,

11:49.300 --> 11:52.660
stating that his patronage would go to the highest bidder, though a few months later,

11:52.660 --> 11:56.500
after the news that more streamers had left Twitch, he was confronted by audience members once more,

11:56.500 --> 12:00.020
wondering if he would be part of the large exodus to the up and coming platform.

12:00.020 --> 12:02.580
However, he appears to shoot these rumours down fairly swiftly,

12:02.580 --> 12:06.260
using his business acumen to point out the problems with the service in reference.

12:06.260 --> 12:09.540
Easy button, move to Mixer, I would never move to Mixer, trust me.

12:11.300 --> 12:11.940
It's stupid.

12:12.500 --> 12:16.580
Right now, they probably have maybe a total 40 to 50,000 concurrent viewers

12:16.580 --> 12:18.180
across the entire platform.

12:18.180 --> 12:22.660
Right now, currently on Twitch, right now, currently across the entire platform, concurrent,

12:22.660 --> 12:25.700
1.5 million concurrent viewers, right?

12:25.700 --> 12:29.140
So you tell me, you step into my face and say, yeah, they're making big moves.

12:29.140 --> 12:30.820
No, they're not, right?

12:30.820 --> 12:36.020
Like, I have double the amount of viewers that Ninja has right now, and I'm still in my intro,

12:36.500 --> 12:37.620
reality check.

12:37.620 --> 12:40.100
Those moves, they're not doing anything for the platform.

12:40.100 --> 12:41.540
You can't pay for a community.

12:41.540 --> 12:43.140
You can't buy viewership.

12:43.140 --> 12:44.100
It's right here.

12:44.100 --> 12:47.140
The Twitch community, it's built on video games.

12:47.140 --> 12:48.820
It's built on communities.

12:48.820 --> 12:49.380
And you know what?

12:49.380 --> 12:51.940
The Doc's reservations were slowly being proven correct,

12:51.940 --> 12:54.420
because not all was completely steady on the Mixer ship,

12:54.420 --> 12:57.220
and although more content than ever was being streamed on the site,

12:57.220 --> 12:59.060
the actual viewership numbers were waning,

12:59.060 --> 13:03.620
and the co-founders James Berman and Matt Salsamendi left in very quick succession.

13:03.620 --> 13:06.900
Although both their posts appeared to express optimism for the future of Mixer,

13:06.900 --> 13:09.860
attributing their departure to a mere change in personal priorities,

13:09.860 --> 13:13.140
it's hard to ignore the interrelation between the exit of these figureheads.

13:13.140 --> 13:16.900
As viewer traffic is arguably the most integral element to a website in that domain,

13:16.900 --> 13:19.780
the information regarding their numbers was not a good sign.

13:19.780 --> 13:24.820
As a matter of fact, by the end of 2019, their market share still only equalled Facebook gaming,

13:24.820 --> 13:28.420
and at that point, I'm pretty sure most people on Facebook don't even know how to use that.

13:28.420 --> 13:31.460
However, though they weren't experiencing great success in that moment,

13:31.460 --> 13:34.660
their presence and their ostensible ambition was enough of a threat to

13:34.660 --> 13:36.980
provoke action from other players in the market.

13:37.540 --> 13:40.340
This threat wasn't just limited to Mixer or YouTube either though,

13:40.340 --> 13:43.780
although I joke about it, Facebook gaming did poach a couple streamers for their site,

13:43.780 --> 13:48.900
and another more controversial fringe site called Dlive did sign a brief deal with PewDiePie in 2019,

13:48.900 --> 13:52.980
and though that was due to expire pretty soon, it could've definitely ruffled some feathers.

13:52.980 --> 13:57.220
In response to these hawkish business techniques, both Twitch and YouTube sought to cement their

13:57.220 --> 13:59.220
status with a variety of commercial deals.

13:59.220 --> 14:02.900
In Twitch's case, this included lucrative contracts with the creators themselves,

14:02.900 --> 14:06.500
such as Pokimane, Dr. Lupo, and of course, Dr. Disrespect,

14:06.500 --> 14:09.220
who in spite of pledging loyalty to the platform the year before,

14:09.220 --> 14:11.780
clearly brought an inalienable presence to the network.

14:11.780 --> 14:16.900
On March the 12th of 2020, Dr. Disrespect tweeted out a video from his account,

14:16.900 --> 14:21.940
promoting the stream platform once more, and emphasizing the exclusivity of his presence,

14:21.940 --> 14:23.220
only on Twitch.

14:23.220 --> 14:29.060
You know the biggest difference between me and you boys?

14:30.340 --> 14:43.220
Is that I can fly without a suit.

14:43.220 --> 14:56.100
The contract was for two years, and although no specific figures were disclosed,

14:56.100 --> 14:59.140
it was definitely no Mickey Mouse Monopoly money to say the least.

14:59.140 --> 15:03.300
In interviews, the doc himself described it as life-changing, and it made perfect sense.

15:03.300 --> 15:07.220
It was true he was one of their most successful streamers, but he was more than that in a way.

15:07.220 --> 15:09.140
I mean, it's just a stronger brand, right?

15:09.140 --> 15:14.340
A lot of the most viewed streamers are defined by their in-game skill,

15:14.340 --> 15:16.660
or just on the basis of the content they engage with,

15:16.660 --> 15:19.300
especially those in the more reaction-oriented genre.

15:19.300 --> 15:22.420
The problem is that when your success is based on the relevance of the game,

15:22.420 --> 15:25.540
or videos that fuel your content, you're often placing an expiry date

15:25.540 --> 15:29.540
when those games or those videos fall out of favour with the greater audience.

15:29.540 --> 15:33.700
Dr. Disrespect was more than that, he was a character, a divisive one for sure,

15:33.700 --> 15:37.060
but you don't garner prestige a lot of the time without making a few enemies,

15:37.060 --> 15:40.260
and sometimes it's better as a creator to evoke a strong reaction,

15:40.260 --> 15:43.540
positive or negative, because it's what will keep some people coming back.

15:43.540 --> 15:46.020
Sure, when he dropped a hot take or just another streamer,

15:46.020 --> 15:49.700
it would typically end up in an article, even drawing some negative press towards him,

15:49.700 --> 15:52.100
but he was always described as the Twitch streamer,

15:52.100 --> 15:56.500
and if any coverage was good coverage, then he was the prime example of that.

15:56.500 --> 15:59.940
I think Twitch identified the longevity in Dr. Disrespect's appeal,

15:59.940 --> 16:01.700
and sought to secure it on their platform.

16:01.700 --> 16:03.780
With the competition gearing up for the new year,

16:03.780 --> 16:07.460
it made perfect sense that they retained one of their most identifiable creators,

16:07.460 --> 16:09.060
what could ever change that?

16:09.060 --> 16:10.500
Well, I don't know.

16:11.380 --> 16:13.380
Okay, that's the part over,

16:13.380 --> 16:17.620
and if you chose to listen to audio for that part, you may now resume watching, hopefully.

16:27.940 --> 16:30.820
June 2020 was a chaotic month to say the least,

16:30.820 --> 16:34.180
for everyone who could possibly be involved in this serpentine story.

16:34.180 --> 16:37.780
Despite their strong corporate foundations, Mixer was faltering in views.

16:37.780 --> 16:41.380
A March report showed that although livestream viewership had doubled over the year before,

16:41.380 --> 16:46.740
Mixer's growth tally at 0.2%, which with their exorbitant financial deals considered,

16:46.740 --> 16:48.980
was nothing less than astounding.

16:48.980 --> 16:50.180
Astoundingly bad.

16:50.180 --> 16:54.020
When June came around, they appeared to be coming to terms with the fact that their platform

16:54.020 --> 16:57.620
was not sustainable with its expenditure, and on the 22nd of June,

16:57.620 --> 16:59.780
Mixer announced they were shutting down.

16:59.780 --> 17:01.380
This should have been great news for Twitch,

17:01.380 --> 17:04.820
who could recapture some of their creators who had previously exited the platform.

17:04.820 --> 17:09.140
However, this positive news was also being overshadowed by a series of criticism directed

17:09.140 --> 17:12.740
at Twitch and prominent gaming figures from female streamers who believe that Twitch's

17:12.740 --> 17:16.020
current system enabled misogyny and harassment on the platform,

17:16.020 --> 17:20.740
with many female streamers sharing their stories of unsavoury experiences with those in the industry.

17:20.740 --> 17:23.940
With the CEO pledging to listen and cooperate in every way possible,

17:23.940 --> 17:27.540
it was a pretty challenging time for the platform and the online community as a whole,

17:27.540 --> 17:31.300
but all seemed committed to seeing it through, with new policy designed to take permanent

17:31.300 --> 17:34.340
action against those who had committed these misdeeds in reference.

17:34.340 --> 17:38.260
Earlier in the month, Twitch had also been under pressure following a series of DMCA takedowns

17:38.260 --> 17:42.180
issued against a variety of channels relating to copyrighted music being used in streams,

17:42.180 --> 17:45.780
and their potential legal liability, with their company's Twitter account posting a

17:45.780 --> 17:48.180
statement expressing respect for these laws.

17:48.180 --> 17:52.340
Dr Dispect was not someone whose name had been included amongst any of these discussions,

17:52.340 --> 17:55.700
and overall there was no controversy surrounding him at this time.

17:55.780 --> 17:59.140
In the months before, he had been involved in a few incidents, most notably regarding

17:59.140 --> 18:02.500
content he'd shared during the start of COVID that many felt was inaccurate.

18:02.500 --> 18:06.260
Needless to say, though, he's not a medical doctor, so most of the time what he said didn't

18:06.260 --> 18:09.700
seem to have any staying power outside a few response articles and tweets.

18:09.700 --> 18:14.180
Dr Dispect was arguably the last person to have any eyes cast on him at this time.

18:14.180 --> 18:18.660
He wasn't a part of any known narratives, he had distanced himself from Mix and other competitors,

18:18.660 --> 18:23.380
all while maintaining a steady schedule and viewership on the website that adoringly hosted him.

18:23.380 --> 18:27.540
Yet on the 26th of June 2020, all of that seemed to turn on its head.

18:35.300 --> 18:38.820
Yes, without even the slightest of warnings, announcements, or messages,

18:38.820 --> 18:43.620
Dr Disrespect's Twitch page went dark, and for the first day left people scrambling for an

18:43.620 --> 18:45.460
explanation on what exactly happened.

18:45.460 --> 18:48.340
Twitch would not comment, and some were questioning whether he'd even been banned

18:48.340 --> 18:50.100
because of the lack of commentary around it.

18:50.100 --> 18:54.260
The day after, video games journalist Rod Slasher-Breslau claimed that he had been informed

18:54.260 --> 18:58.660
as to why the doc had his platform withdrawn, but considered the reasons too legally sensitive

18:58.660 --> 18:59.940
to disclose at this point.

18:59.940 --> 19:04.100
He was one of the first to break the news of Dr Disrespect's permanent ban, and his background

19:04.100 --> 19:06.660
in journalism seemed to give him some authority on the matter.

19:06.660 --> 19:10.580
However, he was not the only person to claim to be in the know, though nobody who did seemed

19:10.580 --> 19:14.820
interested in sharing this knowledge, making this whole premise somewhat dubious.

19:14.820 --> 19:18.580
On the same day, Twitch released a statement to CNN's Shannon Lau stating that they took

19:18.580 --> 19:23.140
appropriate action in response to a violation of their community guidelines, as is their

19:23.140 --> 19:23.620
process.

19:24.180 --> 19:27.700
Not the most believable given their track record, but maybe they had a good reason.

19:27.700 --> 19:31.540
However, the day after, the doc himself tweeted that he had been given no reason from Twitch

19:31.540 --> 19:35.620
as to why he had been banned, and if Dr Disrespect wasn't going to find out, then there was no

19:35.620 --> 19:39.700
chance that any of the wider audiences were going to find out any time soon either.

19:39.700 --> 19:43.460
On the same day, Disrespect's final minutes from his last stream on Twitch were uploaded

19:43.460 --> 19:47.220
to YouTube, prompting many viewers to comb through to try and find any indication or

19:47.220 --> 19:48.900
foreshadowing of the trouble that followed.

19:51.060 --> 19:54.740
With that said, I have yet to see someone.

19:59.380 --> 20:01.140
That's on my fucking level, baby.

20:01.780 --> 20:06.020
Many viewers seem to note that Doc's demeanor visibly altered after the two-minute mark,

20:06.020 --> 20:09.380
where he appears to check his phone following what was a presumed notification.

20:17.220 --> 20:25.460
So I should just put it on just chatting.

20:25.460 --> 20:28.100
I mean, like, I kind of wanted to get off, but now I don't want to get off.

20:28.740 --> 20:33.220
He goes on a brief inspirational spiel about his fan base and how they gotta stay resolute,

20:33.220 --> 20:37.540
before going off on a tangent about David Icke, a former footballer and commentator turned

20:37.540 --> 20:41.060
conspiracy theorist, who advocates for the idea that the world has been taken over by

20:41.060 --> 20:45.300
reptilian elites who are veering the world towards a global fascism hell-bent on eliminating

20:45.300 --> 20:46.260
all human freedoms.

20:46.980 --> 20:48.100
David Icke.

20:48.100 --> 20:49.220
Yes, Alex.

20:49.220 --> 20:51.140
Yes, I like him.

20:53.140 --> 20:57.380
All it allows you to do is just sort of like, you know, allows you to step outside of the

20:57.380 --> 20:58.340
box just a little bit.

20:59.780 --> 21:03.780
It could recently been censored on a variety of online platforms in response to his claims.

21:03.780 --> 21:08.740
However, the Doc vocalizes his admiration of it's outside of the box thinking, a strange

21:08.740 --> 21:12.740
turn of discourse, but not completely unfeasible, though,

21:13.620 --> 21:19.620
Whether some of the stuff is not true or not, whatever, I think the whole, the whole goal, though, is

21:23.060 --> 21:24.100
to wake up!

21:29.940 --> 21:30.440
Yeah.

21:30.820 --> 21:34.820
Anyhow, someone recommends he play Roblox Hide and Seek next stream in his chat.

21:34.820 --> 21:39.060
The Doc seems to pull it up, engage with some YouTube content on it, and maintain a rather

21:39.700 --> 21:43.380
stoic expression, only breaking the science to once more promote David Icke.

21:43.380 --> 21:47.220
He then appears to break character to talk directly to his fans with more motivational

21:47.220 --> 21:50.900
language and acknowledgement of some sort of unspecified challenge in his life.

21:52.420 --> 21:53.780
I appreciate everyone watching today.

21:53.780 --> 21:54.740
Who is it in the backyard?

21:54.740 --> 21:56.180
Who is going to be looking?

21:56.180 --> 22:00.420
We'll get through this Champions Club.

22:01.380 --> 22:04.500
I know it's a tough, life's weird right now.

22:05.700 --> 22:08.980
Who knows what he's exactly referring to, but before we know it, he appears to be in

22:09.620 --> 22:12.260
drops a cheeky expletive and cuts the credits in.

22:20.420 --> 22:24.020
Unsurprisingly, with a fair bit out of the ordinary going on here, many people began

22:24.020 --> 22:28.100
to speculate, some more reasonable, some a little more far-fetched, but it represented

22:28.100 --> 22:30.340
the uncertainty in the Doc's world at this moment.

22:30.340 --> 22:33.780
He said he didn't know the reason for the ban, but there seems to be some recognition

22:33.780 --> 22:37.380
of an obstacle that appears to be troubling him during the stream, and the rather chaotic

22:37.380 --> 22:41.060
ending left many wondering if he'd been arrested, or an even worse fate had befallen

22:41.060 --> 22:44.820
him, with Twitch being able to act accordingly with whichever authorities requested them

22:44.820 --> 22:45.140
to.

22:45.140 --> 22:48.500
However, in the days following, no reports were released that corroborated this theory,

22:48.500 --> 22:51.300
and Dr Disrespect seemed to be at least alive.

22:51.300 --> 22:55.220
However, this didn't provide clarity for those seeking it, and if anyone was expecting

22:55.220 --> 22:58.420
a further explanation anytime soon, they were not going to receive it.

22:58.420 --> 23:02.100
The permanence of this ban was seemingly confirmed when Twitch refunded viewer's subscription

23:02.100 --> 23:04.660
to the Doc's channel, and eliminated his emotes.

23:05.220 --> 23:09.540
In the space of a few days, the seas of chaos and controversy seemed to part for this one

23:09.540 --> 23:12.900
man, and his unrevealed breach of Twitch's conditions.

23:12.900 --> 23:16.820
So much was changing around the Doc in that moment that it was hard to assign a causality

23:16.820 --> 23:20.900
to anything clear, and although some had some pretty solid theories, there was a lack of

23:20.900 --> 23:23.620
confirmation that planted the seed of uncertainty.

23:23.620 --> 23:25.700
Would the silence ever be broken?

23:25.700 --> 23:27.220
Well, let's find out.

23:27.220 --> 23:36.180
Over the following weeks, there was silence from the parties involved, some articles were

23:36.180 --> 23:38.820
published, and some hypotheses shared on the Doc's fate.

23:38.820 --> 23:42.980
Yet most of this was hearsay, and with nobody willing to speak on the matter, very little

23:42.980 --> 23:44.180
progress was made.

23:44.180 --> 23:48.500
How this changed around mid-July, when our friendly PC physician decided to publish a

23:48.500 --> 23:50.660
somewhat foreboding trailer onto his Twitter.

23:57.220 --> 24:17.700
There's not really too much to read into here, but I think everyone figured that the

24:17.700 --> 24:19.220
Doc had unfinished business.

24:19.220 --> 24:23.700
On the same day, he granted interviews to both PC Gamer and the Washington Post relating

24:23.700 --> 24:27.620
to the state of affairs that concerned his removal and the aftermath, including possible

24:27.620 --> 24:28.620
causes of action.

24:28.620 --> 24:32.540
In these interviews, disrespect continues to emphasise that he is still none the wiser

24:32.540 --> 24:36.500
as to why Twitch terminated his contract, however, he seems reluctant to entertain any

24:36.500 --> 24:39.300
theories or provide any further details on his perspective.

24:39.300 --> 24:43.020
At one point in the PC Gamer interview, he begins responding to a question about the

24:43.020 --> 24:47.180
stream comments that touched on COVID misinformation, however, before he can elaborate on what he

24:47.180 --> 24:51.380
thinks, he's interrupted by his publicist who believes they're entering risky territory,

24:51.380 --> 24:53.180
and the question is shut down.

24:53.180 --> 24:56.420
One of the most significant details revealed in these interviews was that the Doc was seeking

24:56.420 --> 25:00.460
counsel for possible legal action, far the reason why he is not particularly forthcoming

25:00.460 --> 25:03.260
with many details relating to his ban as of then.

25:03.260 --> 25:07.100
One thing he does want to distance himself from is the behaviour in his final stream,

25:07.100 --> 25:10.820
affirming that the two incidents are unrelated, and that he was just feeling the pressure

25:10.820 --> 25:13.020
from the world around him at that moment.

25:13.020 --> 25:16.820
He acknowledges it was a curious coincidence, but assures interviewers that he was genuinely

25:16.820 --> 25:20.260
ignorant to what was about to transpire, and that he still is.

25:20.260 --> 25:23.500
It's hard to fully take his word at face value, but there isn't really much else

25:23.500 --> 25:26.820
to take at this point, so this is the best that most could settle for.

25:26.820 --> 25:30.420
There was another lull in developments, with the occasional crypto post here and there.

25:30.420 --> 25:34.980
On July 22nd, a few days after the interviews, one of Dr Disrespect's top Discord mods

25:34.980 --> 25:38.480
shared an old message which seemed to imply that something was in the works, though no

25:38.480 --> 25:40.100
further specifics were provided.

25:40.100 --> 25:44.780
Lo and behold though, barely a fortnight later, the prophecies were fulfilled, with a Twitter

25:44.780 --> 25:47.700
post from the Doc himself announcing his return.

25:47.700 --> 25:51.820
Tomorrow we arrive, with a link to a video uploaded to YouTube.

26:17.940 --> 26:21.820
Now with his previous video also being uploaded onto YouTube, some had already thought this

26:21.820 --> 26:25.940
would be the platform of choice, but this seemed to confirm it even if it wasn't outwardly

26:25.940 --> 26:26.940
stated.

26:26.940 --> 26:30.620
The second was a music video accompanying a song by Jplus1, a regular collaborator with

26:30.620 --> 26:33.220
the Doc, in which he seems to provide the vocals here.

26:33.220 --> 26:37.060
The lyrics include the line, I don't even know why I try anymore, repeated multiple

26:37.060 --> 26:40.820
times, and you can't replace me, remarks that seem applicable to Twitch's recent

26:40.820 --> 26:42.300
measures taken against him.

26:42.300 --> 26:46.560
In this video he's seen in a dark room, looking over an inclement skyline, while serenading

26:46.560 --> 26:49.760
the bright lights, reaching out but never quite reaching them.

26:49.760 --> 26:53.680
Ok, I'll try not to get too artsy here, but there seems to be a lot of subliminal messages

26:53.680 --> 26:58.760
on show, but the most important one was the tweet itself, referring to tomorrow.

26:58.760 --> 27:02.880
This was the date set for his grand return, with many anticipating what he might finally

27:02.880 --> 27:07.320
reveal now he has a platform once more, albeit a new one.

27:07.320 --> 27:08.320
What would he say?

27:08.360 --> 27:10.360
We have no idea.

27:16.400 --> 27:19.440
And I'm gonna tell you this right now.

27:19.440 --> 27:27.600
As far as I'm concerned, we didn't do anything to warrant a ban, let alone how they went

27:27.600 --> 27:30.040
about banning us.

27:30.040 --> 27:35.320
No communication before, no reaching out, nothing.

27:35.320 --> 27:36.320
Boom.

27:36.320 --> 27:37.320
Done.

27:37.320 --> 27:41.040
Well, nothing particularly new in its core message, that boils down to the fact that

27:41.040 --> 27:44.560
he still doesn't know what he has done wrong, and that it had not been communicated to him,

27:44.560 --> 27:47.720
but it's certainly a lot more convincing when delivered with the trademark bravado

27:47.720 --> 27:49.640
that people had come to know the doc for.

27:49.640 --> 27:53.000
He also once more criticises those who have jumped to conclusions on the nature of his

27:53.000 --> 27:57.780
ban, expressing understanding that although people may be looking for an answer, sometimes

27:57.780 --> 28:02.000
one doesn't come too easily, and that he'd be best left with the professionals for now.

28:02.000 --> 28:13.880
The problem is too, there's people in the community that are anxious for an answer.

28:13.880 --> 28:24.680
So what that does, it creates a level of urgency and speculation.

28:24.680 --> 28:26.800
And I think it's just a fucking cockroach approach.

28:26.800 --> 28:30.920
There's big money involved.

28:30.920 --> 28:37.160
So let the legal professionals do what they need to do, that's it.

28:37.160 --> 28:40.440
Now this is a fair way to close discussion on the matter for the moment, he is a streamer

28:40.440 --> 28:44.280
with his own persona to maintain, he can't let this drama be the defining aspect of his

28:44.280 --> 28:48.080
long and illustrious career, however, his response is also revealing in the fact that

28:48.080 --> 28:51.780
it shows he's still exploring legal options, and clearly believes he may have a strong

28:51.780 --> 28:55.620
case to make for himself, provided what he said in that moment is the case, then of course

28:55.620 --> 28:56.620
he would.

28:56.620 --> 29:00.340
However, I wouldn't be giving the stream it's due credit if I focused on a rather

29:00.340 --> 29:05.780
derisory portion of it, let me make this clear, this video is more than that, it's a stone

29:05.780 --> 29:11.700
cold statement, you all better pay some fucking attention, because Dr Disrespect was back,

29:11.700 --> 29:14.420
and this time he was intent on not going anywhere.

29:14.420 --> 29:20.700
I'm gonna stay here and watch him on the screen the whole time, I'm gonna wait right

29:20.700 --> 29:25.780
here underneath the fucking staircase, and I'm gonna wait, and I'm gonna screen watch,

29:25.780 --> 29:29.140
I'm gonna stare at him, and I'm gonna-

29:29.140 --> 29:33.300
With his duration exceeding an entire day, and review counts surpassing seven million,

29:33.300 --> 29:37.200
the doc buckled down to some classic gamer antics providing the fans more of what they

29:37.200 --> 29:41.600
knew him for, and the bunches of video games, banter, and one-liners to boot.

29:41.600 --> 29:44.920
Unfortunately, due to it's protracted length, the video is no longer available to watch

29:44.920 --> 29:48.660
in it's entirety, though the doc did upload a little highlight reel for all those who

29:48.660 --> 29:50.860
missed the first stage of his new journey.

29:50.860 --> 29:54.160
You can also find parts of the stream on other channels that caught it, so you can enjoy

29:54.160 --> 29:56.040
the moment one more time.

29:56.040 --> 30:04.460
I ain't coming, I ain't coming back.

30:04.460 --> 30:08.820
This felt good in many ways for his audience, this was his homecoming, sure, it was a new

30:08.820 --> 30:13.340
home, but it was the same furniture, it was a new chapter, yet the same book.

30:13.340 --> 30:18.180
Over the year, he grew his view base on YouTube, continuing his collaboration with other creators

30:18.180 --> 30:22.560
and studios, even appearing to plan his own entry into the video games market.

30:22.560 --> 30:26.260
Everything was progressing fairly smoothly, and the instant the doc described as a speed

30:26.260 --> 30:32.360
bump seemed to be firmly in the rear view mirror, and yet, in spite of this, he couldn't

30:32.360 --> 30:33.360
stop glancing back.

30:33.360 --> 30:45.620
Don't be mistaken, there was a lot to celebrate for members of the Champions Club, however

30:45.620 --> 30:47.960
this was also still deeply bittersweet.

30:47.960 --> 30:51.700
Although he had found a new platform, the legacy of the past controversy still casts

30:51.700 --> 30:53.400
a long and dark shadow.

30:53.400 --> 30:57.580
I know nobody's probably gonna shed a tear over the state of his finances, the dude probably

30:57.580 --> 31:01.980
does alright for himself, but proportionally speaking, he loves a lot, and a channel.

31:01.980 --> 31:05.940
It still holds a lot of emotional value, value that he clearly felt attached to.

31:31.980 --> 31:38.920
This was something unprecedented for him, let alone everyone else, and he wanted closure.

31:38.920 --> 31:40.420
How was he going to do that?

31:40.420 --> 31:41.420
Well…

31:41.420 --> 31:51.900
Uh, whether it's obvious or not, the blacklisting, the shadow banning, it's happening, as well

31:51.900 --> 32:01.580
as you think we're doing, and I think, again, we're doing well enough, I'll tell you man,

32:01.580 --> 32:07.240
it's been extremely disheartening, it's been a rollercoaster of emotion, and it absolutely

32:07.240 --> 32:08.240
fucking sucks.

32:08.360 --> 32:12.520
Over a year passed since any progress on legal proceedings had been announced, and for some

32:12.520 --> 32:17.160
the case had probably gone cold, however in August of 2021, while responding to a question

32:17.160 --> 32:21.080
in a fairly casual stream, the doc had some news to impart for his eager viewers.

32:21.080 --> 32:25.020
After talking about how his Twitch ban had impacted him, and his business, he revealed

32:25.020 --> 32:26.920
some new information regarding his ban.

32:26.920 --> 32:31.020
But a lot of people ask me, do you know the reason, yeah, I do know the reason why now,

32:31.020 --> 32:37.480
I've known for months now, the reason why, and I'll just say this right now champs,

32:37.520 --> 32:43.480
there's a reason why we're suing the fuck out of him, okay?

32:43.480 --> 32:52.120
I don't know how else to put it, the amount of damages, and you just don't, nah, nah,

32:52.120 --> 33:01.720
um, gotta, I can, I, I, I, anyways.

33:01.720 --> 33:06.200
This was the first time that Dr Disrespect publicly stated he knew why he had been banned,

33:06.240 --> 33:08.560
alongside the fact that he was taking legal action.

33:08.560 --> 33:13.000
It was only a single sentence, but news outlets rushed to cover it with a plethora of postulations

33:13.000 --> 33:17.560
about the rationale behind this decision, however if he initiated a lawsuit, one thing

33:17.560 --> 33:20.640
was true, he believed he had a case.

33:20.640 --> 33:22.840
What did that case constitute?

33:22.840 --> 33:26.680
Well my friends, I think it's high time we bring in our resident Twitch expert into

33:26.680 --> 33:31.560
this discussion as well, and I know what you're thinking, you have a resident Twitch expert,

33:31.560 --> 33:33.420
how come we've never met him?

33:33.420 --> 33:37.420
Well he's a hardworking guy, and he's also allowed only one hour of sunlight a week,

33:37.420 --> 33:41.060
so if he exceeds that in this video, we'll be having works.

33:41.060 --> 33:45.500
Ladies, gentlemen, and all far and wide, allow me to introduce you to my good friend Poutine,

33:45.500 --> 33:50.340
who will be looking into Twitch's legal liabilities, and the prospective case our streamer friend

33:50.340 --> 33:53.420
possessed, take it away my man.

33:53.420 --> 33:58.060
When I first learned about Dr Disrespect's ban, like many others I was baffled, how could

33:58.060 --> 34:02.120
Twitch ban one of their biggest creators, and not even tell them why?

34:02.120 --> 34:06.720
After a couple years of streaming on Twitch, that answer has become a lot more clear.

34:06.720 --> 34:11.100
One thing you need to understand about Twitch is they care a lot about maintaining a professional

34:11.100 --> 34:12.280
public image.

34:12.280 --> 34:16.960
The last thing Twitch wants is to be seen caught up in some petty drama regarding somebody's

34:16.960 --> 34:17.960
ban.

34:17.960 --> 34:22.680
As a result, they've created PR and support teams that rival YouTube and how unhelpful

34:22.680 --> 34:24.080
and robotic they can be.

34:24.080 --> 34:28.920
Their policy when banning streamers, regardless of size or context, is not to make comments

34:28.920 --> 34:31.560
of any kind, public or private.

34:31.560 --> 34:35.640
This includes giving streamers themselves specific reasons for their ban.

34:35.640 --> 34:40.040
For example, Twitch used to send out templates that looked like this whenever somebody got

34:40.040 --> 34:41.040
banned.

34:41.040 --> 34:43.980
If you were lucky, a vague reason would be given, with a simple link to their community

34:43.980 --> 34:46.600
guidelines to, quote, learn more.

34:46.600 --> 34:50.120
If you weren't so lucky, sometimes you wouldn't be given a reason at all.

34:50.120 --> 34:54.960
The fate of any wrongdoers on the platform is decided by a very small, completely anonymous

34:54.960 --> 34:58.800
moderation team, and they have notoriously tight lips.

34:59.040 --> 35:03.560
Not being given a reason for his ban wasn't an exception, it was the rule.

35:03.560 --> 35:07.560
It feels like every month there's a new streamer getting banned without a clear reason,

35:07.560 --> 35:12.240
and beyond making a few tweets, most take this sort of treatment sitting down.

35:12.240 --> 35:13.840
But not the doc.

35:13.840 --> 35:19.000
He had something so strong it was worth suing a multi-billion dollar company over.

35:19.000 --> 35:20.000
What was it?

35:20.000 --> 35:22.840
I've spent the past week reading California state law.

35:22.840 --> 35:25.600
That is to say, it's not been a very fun week.

35:25.600 --> 35:27.360
And I think I've narrowed it down.

35:27.360 --> 35:32.520
Before we understand Dr. Disrespect's lawsuit, we first need to understand how Twitch's

35:32.520 --> 35:33.520
contracts work.

35:33.520 --> 35:37.080
On YouTube, there's one partner program for everybody on the platform.

35:37.080 --> 35:40.040
Twitch, on the other hand, has a multi-tiered system.

35:40.040 --> 35:44.440
On the lowest levels are affiliates, above them are partners, and above them is a more

35:44.440 --> 35:48.860
secretive tier of top creators who have personalized contracts with Twitch.

35:48.860 --> 35:52.820
In order to get one of these more exclusive contracts, streamers often negotiate directly

35:52.820 --> 35:57.120
with Twitch for things like higher revenue splits and a flat payout for streaming a certain

35:57.200 --> 35:58.560
number of hours every month.

35:58.560 --> 36:02.160
Dr. Disrespect no doubt had one of these contracts.

36:02.160 --> 36:06.160
With that in mind, the first conclusion many people came to regarding the lawsuit was a

36:06.160 --> 36:08.040
breach of that contract.

36:08.040 --> 36:12.080
Perhaps Twitch had in some way violated the terms of their own contract.

36:12.080 --> 36:13.920
Now I'm gonna level with you here.

36:13.920 --> 36:17.480
Knowing the specifics of Doc's contract is virtually impossible.

36:17.480 --> 36:20.360
Twitch keeps all of their agreements under NDA.

36:20.360 --> 36:23.560
But that doesn't mean we have nothing to go off of.

36:23.560 --> 36:28.680
Going into 2016, James Varga, better known as Phantom Lord, was on the top of his career.

36:28.680 --> 36:33.360
You might not know his name today, but he was once the most followed streamer on Twitch.

36:33.360 --> 36:37.880
He would routinely stream himself gambling CSGO skins on several different sites and

36:37.880 --> 36:38.880
winning big.

36:38.880 --> 36:43.320
Unfortunately for him, it came out that one of these sites was not only rigged in his

36:43.320 --> 36:45.840
favor but it was created by him.

36:45.840 --> 36:49.520
For Twitch, this was the last straw as he had already violated their terms of service

36:49.520 --> 36:54.840
in the past, and I'm guessing the whole running in a legal gambling operation thing

36:54.840 --> 36:56.840
probably didn't really help his case.

36:56.840 --> 37:01.840
Phantom Lord was banned in July of that year, and two years later in early 2018, Phantom

37:01.840 --> 37:04.000
Lord filed a lawsuit against Twitch.

37:04.000 --> 37:09.440
He was suing them for violating California's unfair competition laws, breach of contract,

37:09.440 --> 37:12.320
and intentional and negligent misrepresentation.

37:12.320 --> 37:25.000
Unlike Dr. Disrespect, Phantom Lord claimed he was entitled to millions.

37:25.000 --> 37:27.800
We can break down his claims into one of two categories.

37:27.800 --> 37:32.280
Twitch violated specific terms of their contract, and Twitch mishandled the ban, causing damages

37:32.280 --> 37:33.280
to Phantom Lord.

37:33.280 --> 37:35.760
For the first category, the court sided with Phantom Lord.

37:35.760 --> 37:39.960
Within his contract was a provision that guaranteed him 30 days notice if Twitch were to ban him.

37:39.960 --> 37:44.040
Twitch failed to do this and was ordered to pay just over $20,000 as a result.

37:44.040 --> 37:47.360
The second category, however, was a different story altogether.

37:47.360 --> 37:51.520
While it was obvious to many in the public why Phantom Lord had been banned, Twitch hadn't

37:51.520 --> 37:55.000
explicitly given him a reason until five months afterward.

37:55.000 --> 37:56.000
Sound familiar?

37:56.000 --> 38:00.040
When he finally got through to a Twitch representative, he was told the ban was the result of fraudulent

38:00.040 --> 38:04.620
payments being made to his channel, an allegation that many in the media were already acutely

38:04.620 --> 38:05.620
aware of.

38:05.620 --> 38:09.040
The reason for his ban was later seemingly changed to reflect the gambling site scam

38:09.120 --> 38:11.400
he ran, among other guideline violations.

38:11.400 --> 38:14.680
He argues that Twitch misrepresented their terms of service to him, and that by banning

38:14.680 --> 38:18.400
him in the manner they did, Twitch's business practices are unfair.

38:18.400 --> 38:22.340
The courts agreed with some aspects of his claims, but ultimately sided with Twitch and

38:22.340 --> 38:25.000
Phantom Lord was never unbanned.

38:25.000 --> 38:29.400
On paper, Phantom Lord came out on top, $20,000 richer.

38:29.400 --> 38:33.560
But it's important to point out that this lawsuit lasted for over three years, and it

38:33.560 --> 38:37.380
didn't get anywhere near the millions of dollars he claimed he was owed.

38:37.380 --> 38:41.020
Given that this case was the closest legal battle to what Dr. Disrespect was about to

38:41.020 --> 38:45.140
go through, and Twitch had no doubt changed their contract since, the odds of winning

38:45.140 --> 38:48.580
anything substantial must have seemed slim at best.

38:48.580 --> 38:51.900
But Doc still had one more ace up his sleeve.

38:51.900 --> 38:56.480
You see, when Twitch terminated their contract with Doc, he lost a lot more than just what

38:56.480 --> 38:58.100
that contract entailed.

38:58.100 --> 39:02.220
Third party sponsors and events immediately backed out of any deals with him, seemingly

39:02.220 --> 39:06.460
out of a fear of association, despite not even knowing why he was banned in the first

39:06.460 --> 39:28.980
place.

39:28.980 --> 39:33.740
Speculation ran wild, and the safest thing for these brands to do was to distance themselves.

39:33.740 --> 39:36.900
From the outside looking in, there was a degree of weight to Doc's ban.

39:36.900 --> 39:40.660
It seemed so serious that nobody felt comfortable even discussing it.

39:40.660 --> 39:45.320
I mean, maybe the reason for the ban was trivial, but none of these brands wanted to stick around

39:45.320 --> 39:46.320
and find out.

39:46.320 --> 39:50.580
Doc losing these deals in partnerships that were made independently of Twitch as a result

39:50.580 --> 39:54.180
of how Twitch handled things seems a bit unfair.

39:54.180 --> 39:57.460
But it's more than just unfair, it's illegal.

39:57.460 --> 40:03.140
Tort is a category of civil law that focuses on emotional, physical, or economic damages

40:03.140 --> 40:04.140
caused.

40:04.140 --> 40:09.220
Within this category is something called negligent interference with prospective economic relations.

40:09.220 --> 40:12.160
This complete jumble of words was his golden ticket.

40:12.160 --> 40:16.700
While simple contract violations got Phantom Lord twenty thousand dollars, this could get

40:16.700 --> 40:19.020
Doc a whole lot more.

40:19.020 --> 40:23.160
In order to win the lawsuit in California, where Twitch is based, Doc would have to prove

40:23.160 --> 40:24.160
eight points.

40:24.160 --> 40:27.600
First, that there was a relationship between him and his sponsor, with the possibility

40:27.600 --> 40:31.940
of future income, that Twitch knew about this relationship, that Twitch knew Doc's relationship

40:31.940 --> 40:37.220
would be damaged if they failed to act with reasonable care, that Twitch did not act with

40:37.220 --> 40:41.020
reasonable care, that Twitch engaged in wrongful conduct.

40:41.020 --> 40:44.740
This one is a bit of a mystery, but it could be a number of things, from breach of contract

40:44.740 --> 40:49.620
to slander or misrepresentation, or any other wrongful act that Twitch might have done towards

40:49.620 --> 40:51.300
Doc relating to his ban.

40:51.300 --> 40:55.540
That Doc's relationship with his sponsor was actually damaged, and that Doc was economically

40:55.540 --> 40:56.860
harmed as a result.

40:56.860 --> 41:00.460
It would be easy to argue that Twitch knew about his sponsorships, and knew banning Doc

41:00.460 --> 41:03.420
in such a secretive manner would harm those sponsorships.

41:03.420 --> 41:07.580
Instead of clarifying the reason for the ban, Twitch allowed theories to run wild.

41:07.580 --> 41:12.060
I don't know about you, but to me, this doesn't seem like reasonable care to somebody who

41:12.060 --> 41:14.100
was one of their biggest creators.

41:14.100 --> 41:18.420
And if the courts agreed, millions of dollars in damages were on the table.

41:18.420 --> 41:22.540
In Phantom Lord's case, his lawyers did mention that Twitch caused him serious monetary and

41:22.540 --> 41:26.860
reputational damage, but interestingly, they didn't seem to pursue those claims further,

41:26.860 --> 41:31.060
possibly because they knew his reputation and job opportunities were already damaged

41:31.060 --> 41:34.860
before the ban by countless articles and videos documenting his actions.

41:34.860 --> 41:38.140
In short, he burned those bridges just fine without any help from Twitch.

41:38.140 --> 41:40.900
The same can't be said for Dr. Disrespect, however.

41:40.900 --> 41:44.700
In his case, the ban blindsided both his partners and the public alike.

41:44.700 --> 41:48.900
Look, I'll be the first to admit, there's no shortage of reasons to sue somebody in

41:48.900 --> 41:49.900
the US.

41:49.900 --> 41:54.580
And to be honest with you, Doc could be suing Twitch for pretty much anything, but if Doc

41:54.580 --> 41:58.740
had any real chance of getting the millions of dollars he claimed Twitch took from him,

41:58.740 --> 42:03.060
it was in this convoluted and wordy section of California law.

42:03.060 --> 42:05.540
The road ahead did not look easy for Doc.

42:05.540 --> 42:09.240
He was going up against one of the biggest companies in the world, with one of the most

42:09.240 --> 42:11.380
well-funded legal teams.

42:11.380 --> 42:16.460
Despite this, he was confident, though it remained to be seen if this confidence was

42:16.460 --> 42:17.460
misplaced.

42:17.460 --> 42:23.420
Wow, what an eloquently spoken chap, only a true genius would have the artistic inspiration

42:23.420 --> 42:25.220
to feature them in a video of theirs.

42:25.220 --> 42:28.300
Anyhow, I shan't stand on ceremony any further.

42:28.300 --> 42:32.940
Regardless of the specifics, Dr. Disrespect believed he had a case, and with the details

42:32.940 --> 42:37.620
behind this exclusive contract, it's understandable why he held that belief, but belief is only

42:37.620 --> 42:39.000
half the battle.

42:39.000 --> 42:42.100
Those looking at his case would need to share his perspective, and when dealing with these

42:42.100 --> 42:45.580
online situations, there's often an element of unpredictability.

42:45.580 --> 42:49.260
Nevertheless, going into the new year, his resolutions were a bit more ambitious.

42:49.260 --> 42:53.420
At the start of this saga, he expressed no intent on returning to Twitch following his

42:53.420 --> 42:58.720
ban, however entering 2022, this had changed, with a large payout and a grand return part

42:58.720 --> 43:00.000
of his yearly aims.

43:00.000 --> 43:04.300
He clearly had an expectation that this lawsuit would yield a favourable result for him, and

43:04.300 --> 43:08.260
given the far reaching impact that his rejection had onto his finances, if the grounds for

43:08.260 --> 43:12.620
his removal were found to be unfounded, then surely he would be entitled to serious compensation.

43:12.620 --> 43:16.580
And we've gotten to such a good point, ladies and gentlemen, Champions Club, we got to such

43:16.580 --> 43:17.580
a good point.

43:17.580 --> 43:24.360
I mean, I'm talking all cylinders firing, the conscious just feels extremely just incredible.

43:24.360 --> 43:28.280
And then to have that taken away from you, and to not know why, and to not know anything

43:28.280 --> 43:34.200
about it, not to be told nothing, boom, taken, grabbed, everything we built, all the eggs

43:34.200 --> 43:36.480
in one bucket, boom, taken away.

43:36.480 --> 43:40.520
The fact that I am here live on YouTube, it's been a fantastic return, I'm telling you,

43:40.520 --> 43:41.520
it is.

43:41.520 --> 43:47.260
The anxiety levels, it's something that comes in these huge waves, and I'm having a hard

43:47.260 --> 43:50.340
time dealing with it, I'll be honest.

43:50.340 --> 43:53.060
However, did Twitch have a case to make as well?

43:53.060 --> 43:56.880
Dr Disrespect always pushed the boundaries of what was acceptable on the platform, and

43:56.880 --> 44:00.660
even if it wasn't their honest reason for banning him, could they refer to these incidents

44:00.660 --> 44:05.340
as factors for nullifying a contract, and find loopholes with such a known provocateur?

44:05.340 --> 44:08.720
The fact that Twitch weren't just taking it lying down seemed to imply that they also

44:08.720 --> 44:12.540
believed they had a case too, but what was the reality?

44:12.540 --> 44:16.780
Well after a couple months of further litigation, an announcement was made on behalf of both

44:16.780 --> 44:18.640
Dr Disrespect and Twitch.

44:18.640 --> 44:23.080
These statements were nearly identical, both conveying that the parties had come to a settlement,

44:23.080 --> 44:25.900
although neither of them admit any fault for their part.

44:25.900 --> 44:30.020
In a way, this result is not surprising, lawsuits can be lengthy and arduous, incurring great

44:30.020 --> 44:33.980
costs for all, and if conditions that each person involved is satisfied with can be agreed

44:33.980 --> 44:38.060
upon, then that is nearly always more preferable than rolling the dice in court.

44:38.060 --> 44:41.800
However, in a follow up comment to his initial statement, the doc clarifies he will not be

44:41.800 --> 44:46.440
returning to Twitch, seemingly contradicting his post a couple months prior.

44:46.440 --> 44:50.620
Had anything changed in that time, or was his case not quite as strong as he believed

44:50.620 --> 44:51.620
it to be?

44:51.620 --> 44:55.720
While it's hard to read too much into it, on the surface, some might assume Dr Disrespect's

44:55.720 --> 44:58.300
case wasn't compelling enough for him to follow through on.

44:58.300 --> 45:02.040
We know he perceives Twitch as the superior platform for streaming, and as a long term

45:02.040 --> 45:06.240
result his return to the platform may have been financially preferable given his impressive

45:06.240 --> 45:07.240
viewership.

45:07.240 --> 45:11.660
Trudy noted another lawsuit that resulted in a plaintiff victory yielded an amount that

45:11.660 --> 45:15.500
probably didn't go particularly far, and although Twitch probably did breach aspects

45:15.500 --> 45:19.140
of their contract, this complaint probably wouldn't yield the payout that the doc was

45:19.140 --> 45:21.280
hoping for, even if proven.

45:21.280 --> 45:25.620
The money was in the implication of Twitch's actions, which is what the doc seemed focused

45:25.620 --> 45:48.120
on, however, proving that would have been a

45:48.120 --> 45:51.720
greater challenge.

45:51.720 --> 46:05.800
As noted, some critics may have viewed the settlement as a reflection of weakness in

46:05.800 --> 46:10.280
Dr Disrespect, or his case, after all he was not prepared to follow through with it, and

46:10.280 --> 46:11.760
actually acquire the desired result.

46:11.760 --> 46:15.840
However, this didn't necessarily reflect a weak case, either it depends on the details

46:15.840 --> 46:21.080
and settlement, if the payout offered to him was large enough, he might have just taken

46:21.080 --> 46:23.080
that deal and gone its own way.

46:23.080 --> 46:26.580
I don't think the doc had a weak case in regards to how Twitch handled their severance

46:26.580 --> 46:30.520
of him, they clearly dealt with it poorly, but that wasn't where the money was.

46:30.520 --> 46:33.920
The following part is mostly theory, but I think it's worth exploring a little, and

46:33.920 --> 46:37.500
it is based on the assumption that what the doc was banned for wasn't quite as shocking

46:37.500 --> 46:40.000
as certain figures had suggested it was.

46:40.000 --> 46:44.120
I think the greatest financial damage in the doc's mind came in the aftermath, and it's

46:44.120 --> 46:48.600
persisting presence on his ability to attend events and garner sponsorships.

46:48.600 --> 46:51.560
Anybody who's banned from Twitch is also restricted from attending events for which

46:51.560 --> 46:55.480
Twitch may be affiliated with, and appearing on any other creator's Twitch streams.

46:55.480 --> 46:59.560
We don't know exactly on what grounds Dr Disrespect sued, but we can estimate that

46:59.560 --> 47:02.320
was probably in the domain that Taut allows.

47:02.320 --> 47:05.760
Although there are few routes he could have taken, he wasted a decent amount of time to

47:05.760 --> 47:10.000
file the lawsuit, despite exploring it from pretty much the onset of his banishment, which

47:10.000 --> 47:13.760
would imply that they wanted to let the dust settle, and the upshot to show itself with

47:13.760 --> 47:14.760
clarity.

47:14.760 --> 47:18.680
At the start, some had considered the additional publicity that he received as actually a positive

47:18.680 --> 47:22.840
result given that many people sympathised with his situation, however over time that

47:22.840 --> 47:27.480
sympathy faded and the financial ramifications became clear because of how dominant Twitch

47:27.480 --> 47:29.320
truly are on the market.

47:29.320 --> 47:33.800
I mean there's a reason why Activision doesn't do a Call of Duty partner code, or we don't

47:33.800 --> 47:37.040
work directly with Call of Duty, or haven't been.

47:37.080 --> 47:44.640
There's so much defamation relating to the ban that we've had to deal with, it's insane.

47:44.640 --> 47:48.280
These were strong words, but they were ones that emphasised the damage that Twitch had

47:48.280 --> 47:52.560
caused to Dr Disrespect, he needed to drive this home to people, and he was smart about

47:52.560 --> 47:53.560
it in many ways.

47:53.560 --> 47:57.640
Part of me thinks that Twitch were hoping that the Dr following his ban would have angrily

47:57.640 --> 48:02.120
taken to stream and revealed details that would have been detrimental in his court case,

48:02.120 --> 48:03.120
but he didn't.

48:03.120 --> 48:06.640
In interviews he focused on the damage, but in all the details he spoke about the mental

48:06.640 --> 48:10.640
anguish, and although I have no doubt he experienced that, his focus on that was important

48:10.640 --> 48:14.080
to drive home the point that Twitch's actions caused visible harm.

48:14.080 --> 48:18.640
To me there was little question that Dr Disrespect had proven that Twitch's actions had tangible

48:18.640 --> 48:23.140
negative consequences on his mobility in the industry and his own mental state in dealing

48:23.140 --> 48:25.560
with the evolving circumstances.

48:25.560 --> 48:28.800
Twitch played an undeniable role in this, sure they didn't want to show their hand

48:28.800 --> 48:32.520
too soon in case people quickly countered them and undermined their reasoning for the

48:32.520 --> 48:33.520
Dr Disrespect ban.

48:33.520 --> 48:37.640
However in this case, as Puti noted, beyond their direct involvement with many other companies,

48:37.640 --> 48:41.120
their ambiguity prompted uncertainty within brands who would typically partner with our

48:41.120 --> 48:42.740
streamer friend in question.

48:42.740 --> 48:46.700
When you're a large company, the last thing you want is someone who is an unknown quantity,

48:46.700 --> 48:49.840
and for a while Dr Disrespect was just that.

48:49.840 --> 48:54.320
Even brands he shared well established relationships with distanced themselves, and although some

48:54.320 --> 48:58.640
returned in time, it was demonstrative of how ignorance could be weaponised as much

48:58.640 --> 49:00.240
as any form of knowledge.

49:00.480 --> 49:05.040
But surely that would depend on whether Dr Disrespect's removal from the platform was justified.

49:05.040 --> 49:10.080
Twitch's statement on Dr Disrespect's ban, as in our process, we take appropriate action

49:10.080 --> 49:14.140
when we have evidence that a streamer has acted in violation of our community guidelines

49:14.140 --> 49:15.540
or terms of service.

49:15.540 --> 49:19.600
These apply to all streamers regardless of status or prominence in the community.

49:19.600 --> 49:20.600
I suppose.

49:20.600 --> 49:24.120
I mean of course if their statement was found to lack sufficient merit then they could have

49:24.120 --> 49:27.880
been in hot water, however I'm sure Twitch had considered that and probably assembled

49:27.880 --> 49:31.320
a reason that they could defend themselves with in the scenario that the Doc took them

49:31.320 --> 49:32.320
to court.

49:32.320 --> 49:36.180
Nonetheless, even if they did find a few breaches of contract or guidelines to use against our

49:36.180 --> 49:39.760
disrespectful friend, would they be completely in the clear?

49:39.760 --> 49:43.120
While you're entering tricky territory, because if he was banned for a justified reason

49:43.120 --> 49:46.360
then Twitch's statement on the matter wouldn't necessarily be false.

49:46.360 --> 49:50.200
It also depends on their actual reasoning behind the ban, we're going to explore theories

49:50.200 --> 49:54.200
very soon, but there are a variety of violations that the Doc could have been banned from Twitch

49:54.200 --> 49:58.120
for, yet probably wouldn't have been too affected by in other parts of the community.

49:58.120 --> 50:02.100
If they had been revealed, even if they were still fair reasons for Twitch's perspective,

50:02.100 --> 50:05.100
he likely would have experienced less impact to his business.

50:05.100 --> 50:08.640
In this case, you could feasibly prove that Twitch's failure to disclose any reason had

50:08.640 --> 50:13.780
a worse impact than actually disclosing a reason, which included lesser breaches.

50:13.780 --> 50:15.760
This is what this is all about.

50:15.760 --> 50:18.400
This is the reason Joshua Holcomb was pulled over.

50:18.400 --> 50:24.660
New Mexico statute 66-3-846, driving with an obstructed window.

50:24.660 --> 50:29.640
This morning I did an informal survey of the courthouse parking lot, and by my count, over

50:29.640 --> 50:33.920
a third of the vehicles had something similar hanging from their rear view mirrors.

50:33.920 --> 50:40.120
So unless you and 47 of our colleagues have outstanding tickets, I'd argue that this

50:40.120 --> 50:42.840
statute is not regularly enforced.

50:42.840 --> 50:46.640
I know this isn't the most academic reference, but there's a brief scene in the new season

50:46.640 --> 50:50.960
of Better Call Saul, where lawyer Kim Wexler illustrates how attentive law had been selectively

50:50.960 --> 50:54.000
applied against one of her clients in a discriminatory fashion.

50:54.000 --> 50:59.360
Kim Wexler- Your honor, this was a perfectly reasonable routine stop for cause.

50:59.360 --> 51:01.200
This was not routine.

51:01.200 --> 51:02.540
Officer Connell knew my client.

51:02.540 --> 51:06.320
In fact, he arrested him five years ago, and Officer Connell's record shows that this

51:06.320 --> 51:10.980
is only the third citation he's written for this statute in almost 20 years.

51:10.980 --> 51:16.980
So either this is an incredible coincidence, or Officer Connell recognized my client and

51:16.980 --> 51:20.020
used the dangler as a pretext to violate his fourth amendment rights.

51:20.020 --> 51:23.920
So that even if it was technically correct, it's poor enforcement had indulged a culture

51:23.920 --> 51:25.940
that normalized that behavior.

51:25.940 --> 51:29.900
I think within reason you could easily make the same argument against Twitch.

51:29.900 --> 51:33.740
In this case, doctors suspect may have felt he had pretty strong grounds to file a lawsuit,

51:33.740 --> 51:37.420
and even if Twitch were happy with their reasoning behind the ban, they may have also been very

51:37.420 --> 51:41.380
hesitant to roll the dice in court this time round, because although in previous cases

51:41.380 --> 51:44.980
they have probably given viewers enough to go off when working out reasons for a ban,

51:44.980 --> 51:49.140
even if not overtly stated, here it was all rather up in the air, particularly given their

51:49.140 --> 51:53.820
inconsistent record on actually disciplining other creators, who similarly pushed the envelope.

51:53.820 --> 51:58.900
Make no mistake, Dr Disrespect is not your ideal Twitch creator, he's not entirely unproblematic,

51:58.900 --> 52:02.380
it wouldn't be particularly difficult to compile a file of all the numerous times he pushed

52:02.380 --> 52:06.400
this stick a little too far for some people's liking, yet Twitch's continuous and even

52:06.400 --> 52:10.840
renewed consent for his presence on the platform set a standard in his mind that he thought

52:10.840 --> 52:11.840
was acceptable.

52:11.840 --> 52:15.760
The moments where he was arguably at his most audacious was in many people's minds the

52:15.760 --> 52:17.800
moments where he was most in character.

52:17.800 --> 52:22.260
The possibility is that Twitch is failure to distinguish that and impose standards consistently

52:22.260 --> 52:27.000
could have undermined the solidity of their own guidelines, but why would they do that

52:27.000 --> 52:29.820
in the first place?

52:29.820 --> 52:33.460
The greatest question that has pervaded this case is why.

52:33.460 --> 52:35.360
Why was Dr Disrespect banned?

52:35.360 --> 52:39.120
I think we're at a point where we may have to accept that we will never know for certain,

52:39.120 --> 52:42.360
and that is the case with a lot of situations, if you're not there, it's hard to exactly

52:42.360 --> 52:43.360
know what happened.

52:43.360 --> 52:46.880
Nonetheless, it's one of those instances where there isn't really even a vague consensus

52:46.880 --> 52:51.080
of what exactly inspired Twitch to take action, theories wildly range from the most severe

52:51.080 --> 52:55.280
transgressions to minor and petty motivations that would surprise everyone.

52:55.280 --> 52:57.880
Why can't we think of a proper reason and agree on it?

52:57.880 --> 53:01.120
Well, I think there are a few factors at play that we can pin down.

53:01.120 --> 53:05.200
The first is, and this one's quite obvious, consistency.

53:05.200 --> 53:09.040
Twitch's failure to enforce rules consistently didn't just affect creators, but affected

53:09.040 --> 53:11.480
an audience understanding of the Twitch rules as well.

53:11.480 --> 53:15.080
Unless you're very accustomed with the platform, I'm sure that many people here wouldn't know

53:15.080 --> 53:19.400
if some of Dr Disrespect's more irreverent behaviour was even in breach of the rules,

53:19.400 --> 53:23.260
and even if we could, we could probably also think of times where people weren't punished

53:23.260 --> 53:27.080
for the exact same transgression, if a large majority of creators wouldn't be punished

53:27.080 --> 53:31.040
for it, why would a creator as universal as Dr Disrespect be?

53:31.040 --> 53:34.200
Other than explaining that the doc was banned for a contravention of the guidelines, the

53:34.200 --> 53:38.240
Twitch statement also subtly implies that said guidelines are consistent, whether this

53:38.240 --> 53:41.240
was an attempt to try and set the standard that their rules have been applied fairly

53:41.240 --> 53:44.760
to try and cover the fact that they were acutely aware that they weren't is not really for

53:44.760 --> 53:48.700
me to say, but it's a curious detail that I think is worth observing.

53:48.700 --> 53:51.920
We know that Twitch is not the most consistent, but something must have changed in the months

53:51.920 --> 53:55.560
running up to the doc's ban that ultimately led to his removal from the platform.

53:55.560 --> 53:59.300
Well, as mentioned earlier on in the video, there were some changing circumstances that

53:59.300 --> 54:02.560
could have altered Twitch's stance on their creators, Twitch couldn't attribute the

54:02.560 --> 54:06.360
changing environment alone to their decision in taking the two time off the platform, however

54:06.360 --> 54:10.340
deep down, given everything going on, it felt like it must have played a role.

54:10.340 --> 54:13.560
The ongoing discussion surrounding the industry's problem with the treatment of women had led

54:13.560 --> 54:17.080
some to draw a connection between the two, but I think the even more significant development

54:17.080 --> 54:20.400
was the retreat at Mixer and their aggressive tactics.

54:20.400 --> 54:23.880
Now Mixer was never the greatest threat to the market, but the way they went about their

54:23.880 --> 54:28.960
business certainly was, and the nature poached large creators if anything disrupted the ecosystem

54:28.960 --> 54:30.120
in an unfavourable way.

54:30.120 --> 54:34.200
I also think the presence of aggressive competition made Doctor Disrespect one of Twitch's most

54:34.200 --> 54:38.440
valuable creators, because he commanded a loyal audience and a unique appeal that would

54:38.440 --> 54:42.200
probably follow him to another platform, many of whom subsequently did.

54:42.200 --> 54:46.480
Now ultimately, with what we know, he couldn't have been absolutely indispensable, and some

54:46.480 --> 54:50.440
may point out the fact that when he left, he actually went to a more competitive platform

54:50.440 --> 54:54.700
than Mixer, and I'd say that's a fair point, however his departure at a sensitive time

54:54.700 --> 54:58.400
definitely could have swung momentum in a way that other creators failed to do so, a

54:58.440 --> 55:02.720
narrative had formed that maybe this was the end of Twitch's market domination, and someone

55:02.720 --> 55:06.120
like the Doc going to another platform could have easily fuelled that.

55:06.120 --> 55:10.040
In hindsight, even if Mixer's statistics showed they never really posed that much of

55:10.040 --> 55:14.560
a menace, their demise allowed Twitch to retain that symbolic stranglehold on the market,

55:14.560 --> 55:17.200
allowing them to act with more confidence and ruthlessness.

55:17.200 --> 55:21.100
It seems that regardless of the actual reason behind Doctor Disrespect's ban, it was more

55:21.100 --> 55:25.340
a result of the evolving circumstances around Twitch, who either felt compelled to do something

55:25.340 --> 55:28.860
in that specific moment, or felt like they finally had the freedom to.

55:28.860 --> 55:33.220
There is a ton of speculation out there, and that's all it is right now, it's complete

55:33.220 --> 55:37.080
and utter speculation, you know, it is the elephant in the room, we have to put it out

55:37.080 --> 55:42.020
there, and we also have to say, we just don't know.

55:42.020 --> 55:45.140
This meant that when reviewing the case, people didn't really have much of a pattern to

55:45.140 --> 55:48.340
work with, they didn't have an established rulebook for Twitch, and they struggled to

55:48.340 --> 55:52.940
decipher what about the Doc's behaviour was exceptional in the run up to his ban.

55:53.060 --> 55:54.060
WAKE UP!

55:58.060 --> 56:02.780
Yeah, sure, his final stream was weird, his behaviour erratic, and narrative rather curious,

56:02.780 --> 56:06.480
but it's hard to really read too much into it, the most you could say is that it seems

56:06.480 --> 56:10.380
like he found out something, and obviously didn't take it well, whether that information

56:10.380 --> 56:13.700
was merely part of the Twitch situation, he wasn't prepared to talk about it, and in

56:13.700 --> 56:17.980
this instance, we can't really do much about it, particularly given that it didn't really

56:17.980 --> 56:22.620
lead to much directly, he wasn't arrested, he wasn't sued, he was just banned from

56:22.620 --> 56:25.940
Twitch, and we still don't know for sure if the two are related, or if the guy was

56:25.940 --> 56:27.660
just acting up a bit.

56:27.660 --> 56:31.500
There is a further factor to consider when trying to deconstruct audience bemusement,

56:31.500 --> 56:34.580
and that being journalism and coverage surrounding the matter.

56:34.580 --> 56:38.660
Not too long after his ban, certain seemingly credible sources in the industry stated that

56:38.660 --> 56:42.380
they'd been informed as to why the Doc had been banned, with many stating that the reason

56:42.380 --> 56:46.660
was really bad, however, if the reason was as serious as they framed it, why would it

56:46.660 --> 56:50.100
be left in the dark to the point where he is still essentially operating the way he

56:50.100 --> 56:51.300
previously did?

56:51.300 --> 56:54.660
Although these people seemed believable in their intent, it was hard to buy it without

56:54.660 --> 56:55.660
any accompaniment.

56:55.660 --> 56:59.180
And I'm not saying that I think these people were lying when they said they'd been informed

56:59.180 --> 57:03.040
of the supposed reason, I think it's very feasible they were told something, but nobody

57:03.040 --> 57:06.340
had the confidence in the reason they'd been told to actually say it.

57:06.340 --> 57:10.140
Slash himself said he was afraid of a defamation lawsuit, and when it's not your information

57:10.140 --> 57:11.900
I can understand that.

57:11.900 --> 57:15.660
Nevertheless, defamation is only valid when the claim is false, and therefore it seems

57:15.660 --> 57:19.220
that many were aware that there could be an error within this reason, or a lack of

57:19.220 --> 57:32.940
supporting evidence to back up these claims if given proper scrutiny.

57:32.940 --> 57:56.120
Eventually, many media sources seemed to retreat, saying, well, we're just as confused

57:56.120 --> 57:58.360
as you are, and the lead went cold.

57:58.360 --> 58:02.220
The focus on something more serious, particularly given the environmental circumstances at the

58:02.220 --> 58:06.300
time, served to add to the broad church of theories regarding Dr Disrespect.

58:06.300 --> 58:09.720
The final factor, of course, is the fact that neither Twitch nor Dr Disrespect ever even

58:09.720 --> 58:10.940
alluded to the reason.

58:10.940 --> 58:14.980
The closest we reached was the doc downplaying any in-stream behaviour, and being interrupted

58:14.980 --> 58:18.940
by his publicist, but that was supposedly before he was aware of the reason himself.

58:18.940 --> 58:22.660
The fact that nobody said a thing implied to viewers that there had to be a benefit

58:22.660 --> 58:26.820
to not discussing it, and sure, the legal explanation is pretty comprehensive, and it's

58:26.820 --> 58:31.540
possible that part of their as-a-court settlement was an agreement to not disclose this information,

58:31.540 --> 58:35.380
and there's that lingering sentiment that surely someone would say something if it was

58:35.380 --> 58:40.220
clear cut one way or the other, if it was so serious that the doc had to go, or if it

58:40.220 --> 58:43.020
was so serious that the doc had to sue.

58:43.020 --> 58:47.060
People have this insatiable desire to find out why, even when the answer isn't in front

58:47.060 --> 58:51.380
of us, yet with all the factors considered, so many theories ran amok, and clouded any

58:51.380 --> 58:55.900
attempt to really analyse each explanation on the basis of its merits, so why don't we

58:55.900 --> 58:56.900
do that now?

58:56.900 --> 59:05.380
There are a lot of theories, and obviously we can't cover every individual defining

59:05.380 --> 59:09.540
detail that makes each hypothesis unique, however, most of these speculations do share

59:09.540 --> 59:14.100
features, and we'll be focusing on the overarching narratives behind them, the arguments in favour,

59:14.100 --> 59:15.500
and against their likelihood.

59:15.500 --> 59:19.020
As with other parts, this is obviously not a definitive statement, and what actually

59:19.020 --> 59:22.980
happened may be completely different to anything we discuss here today.

59:23.060 --> 59:27.820
So with that in mind, let's start with the most unexceptional theories, that being Dr Disrespect

59:27.820 --> 59:32.380
committed a simple breach of the rules, and Twitch decide to ban him on that basis.

59:32.380 --> 59:35.300
How boring, but is it really that improbable?

59:52.980 --> 59:58.780
I mean, Dr Disrespect had certainly received a bit of blowback for his statements surrounding

59:58.780 --> 01:00:02.900
Covid, and it certainly indulged some interesting antics, including claiming he had purchased

01:00:02.900 --> 01:00:08.620
Shungite to combat the alleged radiation from 5G, as advocated by some conspiracy theorists.

01:00:09.620 --> 01:00:14.700
There's a bigger agenda happening, bigger agenda going on, man.

01:00:14.700 --> 01:00:20.740
I'm with Elon, I'll just say it, I'm with Elon Musk, like, look at the data, just look

01:00:20.740 --> 01:00:25.160
at it, man, and we are prolonging something, I gotta stop.

01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:28.900
Now this can all be interpreted in good humour, but in a time where conspiracy theories were

01:00:28.900 --> 01:00:33.040
receiving a lot of harsh criticism, particularly given the pandemic, it's completely plausible

01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:36.720
that some at the top may have been rubbed the wrong way, hell, in his final stream he

01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:40.520
promotes David Icke, who's mention certainly would have turned a few heads on its own.

01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:44.400
Twitch had received a bit of flack from media sources for their inaction on conspiracy theories,

01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:46.480
with Kotaku mentioning the dot by name.

01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:51.360
It was clear there was a frustration in his behaviour, even if it was part of the character,

01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:55.480
maybe Twitch decided that they had to take action to send a message to other creators.

01:00:55.480 --> 01:00:58.560
However, was this even against the community guidelines?

01:00:58.560 --> 01:01:03.040
Well nowadays it would be, however back in 2020, the community guidelines only covered

01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:07.920
this on very vague terms, highlighting misinformation as a breach of the guidelines, however not

01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:12.080
really saying too much about what that misinformation included, in fact the examples they provide

01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:15.840
point towards misinformation in a different sense, more relating to how you present your

01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:20.120
channel on the platform, though it does list feigning distress as an example, something

01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:23.040
that the doc may have been accused of in his final stream.

01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:27.320
At the same time, how would you prove something like that is feigned beyond a reasonable doubt?

01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:30.000
Without a confession, there's really no way you could.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:31.840
Would this have been enough to peg the doc?

01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:33.720
It's possible, but far from definitive.

01:01:33.720 --> 01:01:37.160
He was far from the only person discussing these theories, and surely if Twitch had merely

01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:40.880
spoken to him and communicated that they weren't happy with some of his behaviour, he would

01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:42.300
have changed it accordingly.

01:01:42.300 --> 01:01:46.800
Many would argue that he committed worse transgressions on the platform and received lesser punishment,

01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:50.240
and if they were looking to make an example of him, surely they would have emphasised

01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:52.080
the reason why he was banned.

01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:56.240
The owners of Twitch, Amazon, have a very sympathetic film on David Icke available on

01:01:56.240 --> 01:01:57.240
their website.

01:01:57.240 --> 01:02:00.340
It would seem a little hypocritical to say the least.

01:02:00.340 --> 01:02:04.140
So although possible, this alone probably would have put them in a bit of a tight spot,

01:02:04.140 --> 01:02:07.580
and they presumably didn't have too much to gain from it, especially as the spotlight

01:02:07.580 --> 01:02:11.620
wasn't on the doc at the time, lest we be reminded that despite reaching a settlement

01:02:11.620 --> 01:02:15.900
the Dr Dispect found satisfactory, it still didn't entail him returning to the platform

01:02:15.900 --> 01:02:18.380
like he aimed, they did not want him back.

01:02:18.380 --> 01:02:21.780
Surely a basic breach of the rules was not enough of a motivation on its own.

01:02:21.780 --> 01:02:25.540
Twitch needed to be looking out for themselves when they took this action, and this is where

01:02:25.540 --> 01:02:26.980
other theories can be introduced.

01:02:26.980 --> 01:02:35.620
As noted, the banning of Dr Disrespect followed shortly after the collapse of the competing

01:02:35.620 --> 01:02:40.180
streaming platform Mixer, many of our duty to Mixer's demise as a factor in the expulsion

01:02:40.180 --> 01:02:41.180
of the doc.

01:02:41.180 --> 01:02:43.620
But what if it wasn't just a factor, but the motive?

01:02:43.620 --> 01:03:01.900
A variety of theories have been expounded on this one, the simpler one suggests that

01:03:01.900 --> 01:03:06.060
Dr Disrespect had been expected to transfer to Mixer after a deal had been made behind

01:03:06.060 --> 01:03:09.900
closed doors, and the discontinuation of Mixer had caused this information to be leaked to

01:03:09.900 --> 01:03:13.820
Twitch executives, who saw this deal as a breach of the contract signed by the doc.

01:03:13.820 --> 01:03:17.660
A more elaborate theory states that upon hearing about the dire straits faced by the Microsoft

01:03:17.660 --> 01:03:21.700
owned platform, the prudent minded businessmen approached other large streamers on the website,

01:03:21.700 --> 01:03:25.740
including Ninja, with the mind to start a new Spotify backstream platform by the name

01:03:25.740 --> 01:03:29.180
of Brine, which suspiciously resembles Pride.

01:03:29.180 --> 01:03:32.420
Somehow this made it back to Twitch, and once again they took action against our streamer

01:03:32.420 --> 01:03:33.420
friend.

01:03:33.420 --> 01:03:36.780
Another one advocated by some from the community suggests that the doc allegedly lied about

01:03:36.780 --> 01:03:40.800
offers from Mixer to receive more money from Twitch during contract negotiations, and once

01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:43.900
more when Mixer shut down, Twitch found out and took action.

01:03:43.900 --> 01:03:46.380
Are there any merits to these sorts of theories?

01:03:46.380 --> 01:03:50.180
Well it would certainly give Twitch a stronger motive to ban Dr Disrespect, after all his

01:03:50.180 --> 01:03:53.920
presence on the platform could have been used as leverage to encourage other creators and

01:03:53.920 --> 01:03:57.700
viewers to leave Twitch, although it's questionable whether this behaviour would have constituted

01:03:57.700 --> 01:04:02.140
a breach of the rules, or even an exclusivity contract, they may have felt it more economically

01:04:02.140 --> 01:04:05.540
viable to ban him as they saw his presence as a liability.

01:04:05.540 --> 01:04:09.220
Dr Disrespect's ban reduces his mobility in the community at least, and may make it

01:04:09.220 --> 01:04:14.000
harder for him to set up any sort of competing service, or go anywhere else, there is a long

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:18.900
term financial motive here, but is there anything else, or is it just people trying to find

01:04:18.900 --> 01:04:20.620
a reason when there isn't one?

01:04:20.620 --> 01:04:25.000
First of all, the Brine theory didn't really seem to take off, mainly because Spotify themselves

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:29.420
never seemed interested in launching that sort of service, and its source wasn't particularly

01:04:29.420 --> 01:04:30.420
strong.

01:04:30.420 --> 01:04:34.060
Brine as a streaming website did seem to have some credibility, they do have some social

01:04:34.060 --> 01:04:37.820
pages, but it never really went anywhere, and it's hard to see why the Doc would be

01:04:37.820 --> 01:04:42.000
related to that, especially as they kept uploading promotional material after he had allegedly

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:43.000
moved to YouTube.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:47.140
Dr Disrespect going to Mixer at the end of its lifespan also seems pretty unlikely, the

01:04:47.140 --> 01:04:50.540
Doc would already explain the problems with that sort of platform, and even if they had

01:04:50.540 --> 01:04:54.460
approached him when facing its own closure, which seems unlikely in itself, surely there

01:04:54.460 --> 01:04:58.260
was no way that the Doc would have been able to ignore the signs that this was a company

01:04:58.260 --> 01:05:00.880
struggling, regardless of how much money they offered him.

01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:03.920
Probably the most plausible theories out of these is the one where he doesn't actually

01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:09.120
go anywhere, and he just utilises other supposed offers to haggle a good financial rate, but

01:05:09.120 --> 01:05:11.280
once again, is that something the Doc would do?

01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:16.240
It's very hard to say, he was probably being offered a monumental amount of money anyway,

01:05:16.240 --> 01:05:20.000
was it his time to get greedy, and would Twitch have really been gullible enough to believe

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:23.280
a struggling company was offering big bucks?

01:05:23.280 --> 01:05:27.080
But alright, maybe we don't know the platform he was considering, but maybe he was just

01:05:27.080 --> 01:05:29.800
considering a move of sorts that annoyed Twitch.

01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:34.040
Well, I suppose, but the dude seemed genuinely happy at the platform, and didn't seem like

01:05:34.040 --> 01:05:35.520
he wanted to upset that.

01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:39.800
I know you gotta put on a persona, but even if this explanation gave Twitch a motive,

01:05:39.800 --> 01:05:44.840
it didn't really give Dr Disrespect one, why would he go to any other platform unless

01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:45.800
he was forced?

01:05:55.800 --> 01:05:59.480
We've spoken a lot about the reasons that Twitch may have to ban Dr Disrespect, and

01:05:59.480 --> 01:06:03.440
many of them have and will harp on some sort of social motive, some sort of misconduct

01:06:03.440 --> 01:06:07.280
that causes them to take action, however what if the motive was purely financial?

01:06:07.280 --> 01:06:08.280
Is it possible?

01:06:08.280 --> 01:06:11.840
Well as we know Mixer just shut down, and the Doc had been given a very sizable offer

01:06:11.840 --> 01:06:15.640
to stay on the platform a few months prior, however with Mixer's closure, the newfound

01:06:15.640 --> 01:06:19.920
availability of other large creators, and the decreased competitiveness of the market,

01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:24.560
could Twitch release a few bags by cutting ties with one of their most expensive investments,

01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:28.480
claiming he'd reached terms and conditions, and nullifying a pricey contract?

01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:31.640
Some have suggested that Twitch couldn't afford creators like Shroud or Ninja if they

01:06:31.640 --> 01:06:35.320
had retained the services of Dr Disrespect, however I don't think it would be the case

01:06:35.320 --> 01:06:39.800
of couldn't in this scenario, it's more likely to be a case of wouldn't, but would

01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:40.800
they?

01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:44.480
On one hand this theory fits into the established timeline rather neatly, and would provide

01:06:44.480 --> 01:06:48.800
a clear incentive for his removal, and the Doc's subsequent reaction and lawsuit, however

01:06:48.800 --> 01:06:52.520
there are also uncertainties, with the litigation considered, was it really that profitable

01:06:52.520 --> 01:06:53.520
a move for Twitch?

01:06:53.520 --> 01:06:57.340
Would it really have been so troublesome to see out a contract and retain a high profile

01:06:57.340 --> 01:07:01.020
figure who drew viewers, and why wouldn't they let him back on the platform despite

01:07:01.020 --> 01:07:02.560
offering a payout?

01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:06.160
Surely there had to be a greater motive than breaking an undesirable contract with a creator

01:07:06.160 --> 01:07:09.380
whose longevity has outlasted many of his contemporaries?

01:07:09.380 --> 01:07:13.500
Well let's entertain those now, as we know Twitch was having a bit of an image crisis

01:07:13.500 --> 01:07:16.820
around this time, particularly with how they were presented in the media, and how some

01:07:16.820 --> 01:07:21.000
of their industry executives have been caught behaving, I think the phrase toxic masculinity

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:24.920
might come to the lips of some when analysing the culture that have prevailed for a long

01:07:24.920 --> 01:07:28.360
time, dotted disrespect had not been at the centre of the public conscience regarding

01:07:28.360 --> 01:07:32.520
this controversy, and maybe he had no reason to be, but in many ways his behaviour did

01:07:32.520 --> 01:07:36.400
offend the sensibilities of some around him, Twitch clearly wanted to pride themselves

01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:40.480
on being a safer space for creators, and to distance themselves from the traditional image

01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:41.700
of the toxic gamer.

01:07:41.700 --> 01:07:45.320
We had this discussion earlier with Ninja, who left the platform and subsequently criticised

01:07:45.320 --> 01:07:49.360
its toxicity, like himself, a lot of people who may have been associated with that image

01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:53.280
had distanced themselves since, and even come to attack it, with large streams like Ninja

01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:57.720
becoming available again from Mix's demise, was this the perfect time for Twitch to revamp

01:07:57.720 --> 01:07:58.720
their own reputation?

01:07:58.720 --> 01:08:02.880
I'm talking a lot, this chubby cheeks, 13 year old bratty attitude because his parents

01:08:02.880 --> 01:08:08.680
never disciplined him type of mind frame, it's chatting it up in the chat, uh, I'd like

01:08:08.680 --> 01:08:11.200
to see, where's your top 10?

01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:13.520
You haven't even gotten a victory!

01:08:13.520 --> 01:08:18.280
Ugly kid, let's go through your little specs here, outdated, outdated, everything about

01:08:18.280 --> 01:08:19.800
your life is outdated.

01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:25.240
No one's following your channel, it's horrible, your graphics, terrible, Jacob, your name,

01:08:25.240 --> 01:08:29.260
misspelled your own name, you can't even spell your own name.

01:08:29.260 --> 01:08:30.260
Get out of my face.

01:08:30.260 --> 01:08:34.760
Dr Dispat was, in many senses, a trash talking villainess character who was all kitted out

01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:39.080
to ruin some kid's day, and that was part of his appeal, but as we know, it made him

01:08:39.080 --> 01:08:43.140
a very contentious character point, who probably made his fair share of enemies.

01:08:43.140 --> 01:08:47.440
It's very possible that Twitch had some reservations regarding his behaviour, and even if he wasn't

01:08:47.440 --> 01:08:50.840
directly breaching the guidelines, there was something immutable about his brand that

01:08:50.840 --> 01:08:54.240
conflicted with the sort of platform that Twitch was aspiring to be, and the people

01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:55.760
they were hoping to attract.

01:08:55.760 --> 01:08:59.400
All it took was a couple of those enemies to have the right opportunity to pounce and

01:08:59.400 --> 01:09:03.520
make a case for his removal from the platform, not for any specific reason, but because he

01:09:03.520 --> 01:09:08.280
represented a bygone era for them, a generation of gamers that didn't create a welcoming environment

01:09:08.280 --> 01:09:10.280
for those that Twitch wanted to appeal to.

01:09:10.280 --> 01:09:14.520
The only reason he had been kept on was because Mix and other platforms had been placing pressure

01:09:14.520 --> 01:09:18.120
on Twitch to retain him as a draw for viewing numbers, but once that pressure was gone,

01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:22.640
they could finally take action in shaping the market the way they wanted to, and Dr Disrespect

01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:24.760
was that vision's sacrificial lamb.

01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:26.480
Is there anything to support this theory?

01:09:26.480 --> 01:09:30.040
While it would certainly explain why Twitch were highly vague in their explanation, and

01:09:30.040 --> 01:09:34.260
why Dr Disrespect believed in his case enough to initiate a lawsuit against the platform,

01:09:34.260 --> 01:09:37.720
it would provide an underlying motive for the streaming platform's decision, one that

01:09:37.720 --> 01:09:41.800
could to them have a long term benefit, while fitting in with the broadly held idea that

01:09:41.800 --> 01:09:45.680
the doctor in the house hadn't committed any major malfeasances, or serious breaches

01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:46.680
of a contract.

01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:49.920
It would explain why Twitch didn't want him back on the platform, in spite of offering

01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:53.560
a settlement that he felt was susceptible, implying that they perhaps had a bit of doubt

01:09:53.560 --> 01:09:55.320
in the reasoning behind their case.

01:09:55.320 --> 01:09:59.240
It would also clarify why they really couldn't confront him about it, or ask him to tune

01:09:59.240 --> 01:10:03.120
it down, because it would be fundamentally opposed to who he is as a persona.

01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:07.100
Still, that's a lot for Twitch to gamble on without any actual incident to instigate a

01:10:07.100 --> 01:10:11.380
measure with a creator who was signed for a long term multi-million dollar deal.

01:10:11.380 --> 01:10:12.900
Would it really be worth it?

01:10:12.900 --> 01:10:16.560
Although Dr Disrespect was certainly a more controversial large creator than most, his

01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:20.400
behaviour still didn't really approach the boundary of exceptional, and in a time where

01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:24.640
all eyes were basically on anyone else but him, it would be a peculiar moment to begin

01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:29.420
working on your image by banning someone who was seemingly unrelated to the present controversies.

01:10:29.420 --> 01:10:33.300
With that said, there was always the possibility that Twitch banned Dr Disrespect to distract

01:10:33.300 --> 01:10:36.640
from the controversies they were dealing with, but once again, surely there would be a less

01:10:36.640 --> 01:10:40.380
costly way to deflect attention than banning one of your most popular creators.

01:10:40.380 --> 01:10:43.700
I think the main problem with this theory is that it's one that is built around what

01:10:43.700 --> 01:10:47.280
we don't know rather than what we do know, and although it could fit nicely in with some

01:10:47.280 --> 01:10:51.800
of the black boxes of information, it can never really be the only option, particularly

01:10:51.800 --> 01:10:55.360
when those black boxes are so broad that they yield multiple different theories.

01:10:55.360 --> 01:10:57.240
What could be more substantial than this?

01:10:57.240 --> 01:11:02.440
I can confirm with my sources that it is a permanent ban, and I can confirm that it is

01:11:02.440 --> 01:11:11.260
not DMCA, but I do not have any information on what it is, other than it's pretty serious.

01:11:11.260 --> 01:11:14.940
Well, I suppose there is one more theory, which is the elephant in the room, and that

01:11:14.940 --> 01:11:19.160
is that obviously Dr Disrespect was alleged to have done something so serious that Twitch

01:11:19.160 --> 01:11:22.860
could no longer ignore it, and had to take action against it, or else they could have

01:11:22.860 --> 01:11:24.820
faced serious repercussions themselves.

01:11:24.820 --> 01:11:26.740
Do we know what Dr Disrespect would have done?

01:11:26.740 --> 01:11:31.540
No, and honestly, when it comes to more serious matters, I feel uneasy even speculating, but

01:11:31.540 --> 01:11:35.440
we know that some who claim to know thought it was too serious to even mention, so there

01:11:35.440 --> 01:11:38.180
must have been some possible legal implications.

01:11:38.180 --> 01:11:39.680
What does this story say then?

01:11:39.680 --> 01:11:43.400
Well, Twitch uncovered something, or informed us something, they couldn't take it public

01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:46.960
because of those exact reasons themselves, and they didn't want to put themselves in

01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:51.240
the firing line or jeopardise a possible investigation, however, with the knowledge they had, they

01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:54.600
needed to take action so that person wasn't present on their platform.

01:11:54.600 --> 01:11:59.140
Assumedly, in their mind, this person posed a present threat to other users on the platform,

01:11:59.140 --> 01:12:02.860
maybe the medium he was operating over was through these networks, and Twitch believed

01:12:02.860 --> 01:12:05.280
it to be their duty to cut those networks off.

01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:08.540
Additionally, with the recent criticism that they've been receiving of an action where

01:12:08.540 --> 01:12:12.740
severe misconduct was present, it would have reflected very poorly on them if information

01:12:12.740 --> 01:12:16.740
was released that showed they were aware of the wrongdoings taking place, and had subsequently

01:12:16.740 --> 01:12:17.740
done nothing.

01:12:17.740 --> 01:12:21.720
I'll add that this doesn't mean Dr Disrespect has done anything criminal, maybe he was completely

01:12:21.720 --> 01:12:25.200
innocent of whatever he'd been accused of, but given the external pressure and tense

01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:28.820
environment, Twitch felt compelled to act, as reluctant as they were to ban one of their

01:12:28.820 --> 01:12:33.140
largest most recognisable names, maybe the risk of doing nothing was just too great for

01:12:33.140 --> 01:12:36.180
them to roll the dice with, there was really no other option for them.

01:12:36.180 --> 01:12:37.700
What can be said in this story's favour?

01:12:37.700 --> 01:12:41.360
Well, I suppose the first thing to note was obviously the claim that some names in the

01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:45.060
industry corroborated this theory, and made public statements that seemed to imply that

01:12:45.060 --> 01:12:46.540
something serious had occurred.

01:12:46.540 --> 01:12:50.900
It provides a rationale behind Twitch's behaviour and both parties' reluctance to speak about

01:12:50.900 --> 01:12:55.500
the actual reason, as whether true or false could affect either credibility or culpability.

01:12:55.500 --> 01:12:58.620
It would explain some of the brand reactions if they'd been informed of the reason for

01:12:58.620 --> 01:13:02.980
his ban, and would explain why he has struggled to obtain contracts for any other large platform

01:13:02.980 --> 01:13:04.060
as far as we know.

01:13:04.060 --> 01:13:07.900
That sort of information may be considered privileged, and it may explain why we don't

01:13:07.900 --> 01:13:11.940
know, but surely if this was the case, we would have heard something, or at least we

01:13:11.940 --> 01:13:13.380
should have heard something.

01:13:13.380 --> 01:13:16.700
Twitch didn't just unpartner Dr Disrespect, they deplatformed him.

01:13:16.700 --> 01:13:21.040
A few days before Dr Disrespect launched on YouTube, Slash reported that although YouTube

01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:24.740
would not stop the doc from streaming on his platform, they wouldn't be signing any deals

01:13:24.740 --> 01:13:27.300
with him, as if that was some sort of point against him.

01:13:27.300 --> 01:13:32.620
I have seen no evidence, I have investigated fully, there's a possibility of him going

01:13:32.620 --> 01:13:38.740
to another platform, okay, YouTube is out, they have not been in any discussions with

01:13:38.740 --> 01:13:39.740
Dr Disrespect.

01:13:39.740 --> 01:13:47.740
We started 11 years ago here on YouTube, and boy oh boy oh boy does it feel good to be

01:13:47.740 --> 01:13:48.740
back.

01:13:48.740 --> 01:13:52.020
The dude has still done well for himself in spite of YouTube's occasionally sub-passed

01:13:52.020 --> 01:13:53.020
streaming system.

01:13:53.020 --> 01:13:55.560
He has a fully monetised channel with 4 million subscribers.

01:13:55.560 --> 01:13:58.720
Some would look at this and conclude that what he did couldn't have been that heinous

01:13:58.720 --> 01:14:02.400
because he still had the opportunity to succeed elsewhere in the industry.

01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:05.960
Many would also note that Disrespect took Twitch to court over this, and although criminals

01:14:05.960 --> 01:14:09.980
have certainly made bolder moves, for someone whose public reputation is so integral to

01:14:09.980 --> 01:14:13.960
his work, it would be surprising for him to put that at stake on a court case, which could

01:14:13.960 --> 01:14:16.760
have exposed him when he could have just as easily moved on.

01:14:16.760 --> 01:14:21.120
It seems this theory of serious malfeasance seemed the most plausible at first, but as

01:14:21.120 --> 01:14:25.720
time passed it began to appear a little doubtful, though it's fair to say, not impossible.

01:14:25.720 --> 01:14:30.280
However, not impossible isn't really the level of certainty we want to operate on,

01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:33.560
but I ask you now, do we have any other option?

01:14:33.560 --> 01:14:43.280
As I said earlier, the truth may be completely unrelated to all the theories we've discussed

01:14:43.280 --> 01:14:44.280
today.

01:14:44.280 --> 01:14:47.120
There are many variables in a case like this that it's too hard to account for every

01:14:47.120 --> 01:14:51.840
single one, but judging previous cases, general human behaviour, and the nature of many of

01:14:51.840 --> 01:14:55.480
these large corporations, these hypotheses seem to be the most popular.

01:14:55.480 --> 01:15:00.280
Each one has their individual merit and logic behind it, yet there's a negative relationship

01:15:00.280 --> 01:15:02.240
within each of the theories.

01:15:02.240 --> 01:15:06.460
That being, the theories that give more reason behind Twitch's behaviour give less reason

01:15:06.460 --> 01:15:08.500
behind Dr Disrespect's behaviour.

01:15:08.500 --> 01:15:12.000
The alternative streaming platform theory is probably the most believable in regards

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:16.320
to how Twitch would act, but it seems really out of character for Dr Disrespect to do anything

01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:17.320
like that.

01:15:17.320 --> 01:15:21.600
Although we do have clear evidence of Dr Disrespect leaning into conspiracy theories, there's

01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:26.240
no real evidence of Twitch ever taking action against it in the past, and no reason to not

01:15:26.240 --> 01:15:28.880
just approach him and tell him to cut it out.

01:15:28.880 --> 01:15:32.440
Over time, I think many have tended towards those theories that are more sympathetic to

01:15:32.440 --> 01:15:36.780
the Doc, not just because of the actual evolving facts surrounding the case, but because they

01:15:36.780 --> 01:15:39.860
want to believe that the guy genuinely didn't do anything wrong.

01:15:39.860 --> 01:15:43.600
They saw someone who had been singled out by a platform for a reason that they never

01:15:43.600 --> 01:15:57.600
explained and suffered consequences for being himself, and it's understandable to be honest,

01:15:57.600 --> 01:16:01.840
because one of the more thought-provoking questions I'd say is who or how Twitch actually

01:16:01.840 --> 01:16:03.200
helped by doing this.

01:16:03.200 --> 01:16:06.400
Obviously, on the surface, Twitch didn't really help themselves, they lost a creative

01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:10.920
brought in revenue and viewers, and was subjected to a lawsuit, certainly didn't help Dr Disrespect

01:16:10.920 --> 01:16:14.900
who felt so aggrieved he initiated the lawsuit in the first place, and although it did lead

01:16:14.900 --> 01:16:18.800
to some hijinks, I don't really think fans found the drama particularly gratifying.

01:16:18.800 --> 01:16:23.360
If Twitch's aim was to protect any particular party, they haven't really done much either,

01:16:23.360 --> 01:16:27.140
sure they've covered their own asses, but the dude just went to another platform and

01:16:27.140 --> 01:16:31.280
still possesses enough power to hold tournaments and attend events, even if the opportunities

01:16:31.280 --> 01:16:32.520
aren't quite as vast.

01:16:32.520 --> 01:16:37.220
If it ever did come out that Dr Disrespect had been behaving, dare I say it, less than

01:16:37.220 --> 01:16:40.880
respectfully, would Twitch be completely in the clear for how they handled it?

01:16:40.880 --> 01:16:44.160
I have a hunch that they wouldn't be, early on there were some viewers who believed this

01:16:44.160 --> 01:16:49.480
was all a large ruse for a new era of Dr Disrespect, I don't think many people are of that school

01:16:49.480 --> 01:16:54.680
of thought anymore, but sometimes it just seems like the only remotely plausible explanation

01:16:54.680 --> 01:16:58.880
because it's just so hard to make sense of it otherwise, it's hard to find an explanation

01:16:58.880 --> 01:17:02.000
that rationalises the behaviour of everyone involved.

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:05.920
I often find myself returning to the question of Twitch's image, as that's the only

01:17:05.920 --> 01:17:07.460
real motive that I can find.

01:17:07.460 --> 01:17:12.380
By running such a secretive and often partisan system, Twitch set no real standard of conduct,

01:17:12.380 --> 01:17:16.100
the only thing that often seemed consistent was the fact that larger creators did receive

01:17:16.100 --> 01:17:19.820
better treatment than small creators, but the disappearance of Dr Disrespect seemed

01:17:19.820 --> 01:17:23.740
to spit in the face of that belief, leading many to conclude that it must have been truly

01:17:23.740 --> 01:17:28.380
exceptional behaviour, but maybe Twitch saw an opportunity in image revamp, under pressure

01:17:28.380 --> 01:17:32.220
from a variety of media sources who all seemed to have the same grievance with him, this

01:17:32.220 --> 01:17:36.380
was their statement to say that they weren't complete pushovers, but would it have really

01:17:36.380 --> 01:17:37.380
worked?

01:17:37.420 --> 01:17:39.140
Well, I don't think so.

01:17:39.140 --> 01:17:42.780
Twitch still finds itself in and out of the spotlight for the decisions they take, they're

01:17:42.780 --> 01:17:46.300
still accused of employing double standards for their preferred creators, and it's hard

01:17:46.300 --> 01:17:49.980
to make the case that the atmosphere on the platform has changed since the Doc's departure.

01:17:49.980 --> 01:17:54.100
It's really hard to say if the Doc was an influence on that in the first place, or if

01:17:54.100 --> 01:17:55.860
he was just running his own show.

01:17:55.860 --> 01:17:59.900
Twitch is so large at this point that a creator leaving doesn't seem to exert great cultural

01:17:59.900 --> 01:18:04.460
influence, sure, he's popular, well known, influential, and he still is, but he's never

01:18:04.460 --> 01:18:08.660
been a singular spokesperson for the gaming community, Dr Disrespect's popularity was

01:18:08.660 --> 01:18:13.740
just a reflection of gaming culture, rather than being some industry-wide puppeteer, and

01:18:13.740 --> 01:18:17.020
there have been many more serious examples of toxic behaviour on the platform in the

01:18:17.020 --> 01:18:21.780
last couple of years, not to mention Dr Disrespect's own more serious antics that were often given

01:18:21.780 --> 01:18:23.900
the soft touch by the Twitch moderation team.

01:18:23.900 --> 01:18:41.540
Some could say his expulsion was in a way designed to prevent the accusations of double

01:18:41.540 --> 01:18:45.420
standards when they took more serious action against toxicity, but it's not like those

01:18:45.420 --> 01:18:50.020
accusations ever seemed to concern them in the past, the truth is Twitch really haven't

01:18:50.020 --> 01:18:53.660
done that much, they've rewritten their terms and conditions a few times, tried to stay

01:18:53.660 --> 01:18:57.180
on the pulse with popular opinion and what social media is saying, but that's not

01:18:57.180 --> 01:18:58.180
new.

01:18:58.180 --> 01:19:01.900
All of these platforms are works in progress that adapt themselves to the zeitgeist, Twitch

01:19:01.900 --> 01:19:06.340
didn't seem to undergo any radical reforms as a consequence of them banning Dr Disrespect,

01:19:06.340 --> 01:19:09.720
and you'd think if they saw creators with his attitude as that much of a threat then

01:19:09.720 --> 01:19:10.720
they would have.

01:19:10.720 --> 01:19:14.900
As a large corporate conglomerate with business interests at heart, people struggle to rationalise

01:19:14.900 --> 01:19:19.580
Twitch's behaviour, which is why many end up siding with Dr Disrespect, but how are

01:19:19.580 --> 01:19:48.740
we even to know that this was a corporate decision?

01:19:48.740 --> 01:20:09.360
There's been some discourse about how Twitch handle their bans, and I think one thing to

01:20:09.360 --> 01:20:13.820
note is that it's often a very select few who actually hand down and enforce those bans,

01:20:13.820 --> 01:20:18.400
and it's an extremely secretive process, who is to stop it from getting personal?

01:20:18.400 --> 01:20:22.160
We know Dr Disrespect is a little more than just a character, he could have easily pissed

01:20:22.160 --> 01:20:26.080
someone powerful at Twitch off with them coming to the conclusion that they just didn't want

01:20:26.080 --> 01:20:29.440
him around, maybe he didn't do anything criminal, maybe he didn't even breach the

01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:33.720
guidelines in that time, he just did or said something behind the scenes that made an individual

01:20:33.720 --> 01:20:37.800
or fellow streamer feel compelled to take action against him, maybe out of spite or

01:20:37.800 --> 01:20:40.040
maybe to save their own skin.

01:20:40.040 --> 01:20:43.440
Perhaps a personal matter overlapped into business, if it was a private matter then

01:20:43.440 --> 01:20:47.520
who knows where or when it happened, or anything that could be revealed that may bring certain

01:20:47.520 --> 01:20:51.540
figures into disrepute, we often see Twitch as an entity, and the decisions they make

01:20:51.540 --> 01:20:55.360
as collective, but the truth is, a company is still made up of a lot of people with their

01:20:55.360 --> 01:20:59.680
own motivations, choices are seldom taken without personal bias, and even if there were

01:20:59.680 --> 01:21:03.760
some forms of corporate justification, it's completely valid to suggest that this was

01:21:03.760 --> 01:21:07.500
instigated on a personal whim, even if it wasn't presented as such.

01:21:07.500 --> 01:21:11.840
This just extends the realm of possible theories to nearly intangible levels, and leaves us

01:21:11.840 --> 01:21:13.960
right back where we started.

01:21:13.960 --> 01:21:18.040
You may believe the best in Dr Disrespect because they see Dr Disrespect as the human

01:21:18.040 --> 01:21:21.760
he is, and although Twitch really didn't do the best to differentiate themselves from

01:21:21.760 --> 01:21:25.960
robots with their public statements, they're still a company full of humans too, they're

01:21:25.960 --> 01:21:29.860
just people whose decisions may only ever be known to themselves, providing us very

01:21:29.860 --> 01:21:34.480
little evidence to work with, and when looking for explanations we latch onto what we have,

01:21:34.480 --> 01:21:39.520
but as said, maybe the key here is what we haven't, and perhaps there's not much we

01:21:39.520 --> 01:21:40.520
can do about that.

01:21:43.960 --> 01:21:54.440
Many internet dwellers have this inherent desire to find out the truth of a situation,

01:21:54.440 --> 01:21:58.040
and in a way it's understandable, when we have the truth we can make a more balanced

01:21:58.040 --> 01:22:02.200
judgement, however with 99% of disputes we have to accept that we will never have the

01:22:02.200 --> 01:22:05.560
full picture to pass judgement without any reservation at all.

01:22:05.560 --> 01:22:09.400
With that said, with this case we have a lot less than that, and it makes it even harder

01:22:09.400 --> 01:22:11.640
for anyone to arbitrate with clarity.

01:22:11.640 --> 01:22:15.460
Nonetheless, people still like to have strong opinions, and in the time following his ban

01:22:15.460 --> 01:22:19.120
and looking at the record of Twitch and The Doc respectively, people decided that whatever

01:22:19.120 --> 01:22:23.040
the truth, that Dr Disrespect had probably been done dirty, and deserved better from

01:22:23.040 --> 01:22:28.040
a platform he had enthusiastically hosted his content on and supported behind the scenes

01:22:28.040 --> 01:22:29.040
for years.

01:22:29.040 --> 01:22:34.320
This is a guy who was involved in the Justin.tv years, much longer than most of Twitch's

01:22:34.320 --> 01:22:46.000
biggest names right now.

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:50.240
Now we must accept that there are circumstances where loyalty would not be enough to exonerate

01:22:50.240 --> 01:22:53.920
one's actions, but since we have no idea what these actions are, and only rumours to

01:22:53.920 --> 01:22:57.840
base our suspicions off, it's fair that many erred on Dr Disrespect's side.

01:22:57.840 --> 01:23:01.360
I think people looked at the rumours of the more serious acts that are alleged to have

01:23:01.360 --> 01:23:05.200
occurred, and thought, if nobody's willing to put it out there, then they can't be

01:23:05.200 --> 01:23:06.200
that confident in it.

01:23:06.200 --> 01:23:10.200
There are of course other reasons why something may not be public, and no stranger to this,

01:23:10.200 --> 01:23:13.840
a lot of companies were much more anxious about the fact that nothing had been said.

01:23:13.840 --> 01:23:17.320
They likely believed that reputational damage could be inflicted if they partnered with

01:23:17.320 --> 01:23:20.760
a person who was soon revealed to be acting outside the realm of acceptability.

01:23:20.760 --> 01:23:25.640
For a while, not even Dr Disrespect appeared to know what happened, I'm sure he was probably

01:23:25.640 --> 01:23:30.040
more well informed than anyone else, but it's not like he could publicly theorise either,

01:23:30.040 --> 01:23:33.320
as that would make him liable if he believed he had grounds to take legal action.

01:23:33.320 --> 01:23:37.080
So he wasn't going to say anything, and when he did it was non-committal or dismissive

01:23:37.080 --> 01:23:41.040
of certain theories, such as the one that revolved around the final stream.

01:23:41.040 --> 01:23:44.440
Eventually legal action was initiated, and we thought that, once resolved, the one factor

01:23:44.440 --> 01:23:48.280
that may have been causing the secrecy would be relieved, and we'd finally find out the

01:23:48.280 --> 01:23:51.800
truth, especially if the Doc secured his return to Twitch.

01:23:51.800 --> 01:23:55.960
However, it seemed as part of that settlement, neither party was going to be discussing the

01:23:55.960 --> 01:23:59.860
matter any further, both releasing highly impersonal statements that could barely be

01:23:59.860 --> 01:24:01.580
distinguished between each other.

01:24:01.580 --> 01:24:04.800
Even the agreement itself was hard to read into, as it's difficult to say how much

01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:08.720
money was offered, and how that reflected in the strength of the case against Twitch.

01:24:08.720 --> 01:24:12.560
All we know is that the Doc was confident enough to file a lawsuit against the company,

01:24:12.560 --> 01:24:16.160
but also happy enough to settle, there are a lot of ways to interpret that which depend

01:24:16.160 --> 01:24:18.000
on details that we don't know.

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:22.720
Listen, I just point out the obvious, plus, you know, once I got banned from the Purple

01:24:22.720 --> 01:24:26.640
Snakes platform, they like, secretly shadow banned and stopped talking to us, and all

01:24:26.640 --> 01:24:31.040
that stuff, and to me, like, I took it personal, like, what the fuck, dude, we made multiple

01:24:31.040 --> 01:24:35.280
commercials, we did lots of deals, and to exclude us from anything, and to not allow,

01:24:35.280 --> 01:24:40.040
like, trust me, you know, design half the maps for Advanced Warfare, like, we've done

01:24:40.040 --> 01:24:44.680
a lot with the franchise, right, and for them to turn the cold shoulder like that?

01:24:44.680 --> 01:24:46.420
Trust me, I took it personal.

01:24:46.420 --> 01:24:50.200
It's clear that the consequences of the Twitch ban are still in place, and Dr Disrespect

01:24:50.200 --> 01:24:53.220
even vents his frustration from time to time on the matter.

01:24:53.220 --> 01:24:56.680
Recently he hosted a Zero Bill tournament on Fortnite, with some popular Twitch streamers

01:24:56.680 --> 01:24:57.680
also competing.

01:24:57.680 --> 01:25:01.220
Boom TV, the host of the event, released a statement to competitors explaining that it

01:25:01.220 --> 01:25:05.380
was prohibited for them to knowingly feature the suspended gentleman in question, and providing

01:25:05.380 --> 01:25:09.620
suggestions and alternatives to avoid experiencing any negative repercussions for interacting

01:25:09.620 --> 01:25:10.620
with him.

01:25:10.620 --> 01:25:15.160
Hard to say if Doc saw the funny side to this, though he did manage a little Twitter chuckle.

01:25:15.160 --> 01:25:19.560
We understand that there may be instances where suspended users may appear on your stream

01:25:19.560 --> 01:25:24.480
due to circumstances beyond your control, such as through third party gaming tournaments,

01:25:24.480 --> 01:25:29.120
but we expect that you make a good faith effort to remove them from your broadcast, mute them,

01:25:29.120 --> 01:25:32.280
or otherwise limit their interactions with your stream.

01:25:32.280 --> 01:25:35.720
Who knows whether the truth will ever come out, and maybe at some point in the future

01:25:35.720 --> 01:25:39.640
some will decide they have very little to lose by speaking openly about it, but for

01:25:39.640 --> 01:25:41.400
the moment it remains a mystery.

01:25:41.400 --> 01:25:45.280
I'm sure some will wonder why, if the facts were in Dr Disrespect's favour as much as

01:25:45.280 --> 01:25:47.400
they were, he wouldn't just speak up.

01:25:47.400 --> 01:25:51.320
Regardless of the consequences, surely it's better to illustrate how ludicrous Twitch

01:25:51.320 --> 01:25:53.600
were in banning him, right?

01:25:53.600 --> 01:25:57.420
Well I think the greatest concern for a creator and businessman like Dr Disrespect would be

01:25:57.420 --> 01:26:01.640
to have his career defined by the ban, and in a way it was a challenge to avoid it.

01:26:01.640 --> 01:26:05.440
It was such a seismic shift in the community that very few could miss it, there's little

01:26:05.440 --> 01:26:09.000
doubt that the uncertainty has prolonged people's discourse surrounding it, making us wonder

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:12.360
if it had been over sooner if the doc had just built the beans and allowed people to

01:26:12.360 --> 01:26:13.360
make their own judgement.

01:26:13.360 --> 01:26:17.000
However, there's no guarantee that any explanation would have provided closure, and if it was

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:20.760
contentious enough, could have very easily instigated more conflict if someone wanted

01:26:20.760 --> 01:26:21.800
to dispute it.

01:26:21.800 --> 01:26:25.640
In this case, it may very well be that the less anyone said the better, the financial

01:26:25.640 --> 01:26:29.800
setback of being banned from Twitch is great, but the setback of having your career overshadowed

01:26:29.800 --> 01:26:33.760
by conflict, whether you're in the right or not, is so much greater.

01:26:33.760 --> 01:26:36.960
If the guy had lost everything already, then maybe he would have been a bit more tenacious

01:26:36.960 --> 01:26:42.120
in court, but he's still out of channel, a fanbase, a company, partnerships, and a

01:26:42.120 --> 01:26:45.600
variety of other outlets that were worth no less of his time.

01:26:45.600 --> 01:26:49.720
It's understandable that some people to this day still want to know what exactly happened,

01:26:49.720 --> 01:26:53.680
but the truth is, we're just not entitled to it, and there's no guarantee that knowing

01:26:53.680 --> 01:26:56.800
would enhance our lives or our judgement in any way at all.

01:26:56.800 --> 01:27:00.660
There's nothing wrong with theorising, but sometimes we just have to settle with theories

01:27:00.660 --> 01:27:04.680
inside who we want to support in a situation, I think that's what Dr Disrespect would

01:27:04.680 --> 01:27:05.680
prefer at least.

01:27:05.680 --> 01:27:09.860
He knew he had to address it, but his tone in the interviews always showed a bit of disdain

01:27:09.860 --> 01:27:13.080
for the theories that people were advocating, and even hinting at.

01:27:13.080 --> 01:27:16.280
The general impression I receive from him is that he's the sort of guy who believes

01:27:16.280 --> 01:27:20.200
that he will rebuild everything if he has to, with or without Twitch, and he'd much

01:27:20.200 --> 01:27:21.640
rather talk about that.

01:27:21.640 --> 01:27:24.960
He spent long enough in the industry to know how to survive, whether he'll truly ever

01:27:24.960 --> 01:27:28.920
have the last laugh is something that's yet to be revealed, but for now it seems that

01:27:28.920 --> 01:27:31.280
everyone got what they wanted.

01:27:31.280 --> 01:27:35.200
As a company, Twitch has continued to dominate in their domain, YouTube and Facebook Gaming

01:27:35.200 --> 01:27:38.520
have both retained their presence, but they can't come close to the control that Twitch

01:27:38.520 --> 01:27:39.520
exerts on the market.

01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:43.080
Don't get me wrong, they're still on their bullshit, but creators are still going to

01:27:43.080 --> 01:27:46.520
stream, and viewers are still going to tune in, because there's no platform that can

01:27:46.520 --> 01:27:49.540
provide you with the streaming dream like Twitch does.

01:27:49.540 --> 01:27:53.560
You can't blame people for wanting to take advantage of that, but as Dr Disrespect found

01:27:53.560 --> 01:27:56.280
out, sometimes you have to modify your dreams a little.

01:27:57.280 --> 01:28:05.280
Millions of minutes watched is the number one metric, and it's right here on Twitch.

01:28:05.280 --> 01:28:09.280
It's a shame that the Dr Disrespect Twitch era ever had to come to an end, but whether

01:28:09.280 --> 01:28:13.680
there was a good reason or not, there's always an opportunity for a new era to begin.

01:28:26.280 --> 01:28:38.400
I'm excited, extremely excited that a team at Midnight Society absolutely busted their

01:28:38.400 --> 01:28:42.260
asses off, and we're here to change the game.

01:28:42.260 --> 01:28:45.720
Twitch and Dr Disrespect had a very prosperous business relationship.

01:28:45.720 --> 01:28:49.520
In many ways, it was one that seemed mutually beneficial and deeply rooted for the large

01:28:49.520 --> 01:28:51.440
proportion of its existence.

01:28:51.440 --> 01:28:55.160
Twitch as a platform trying to cement its status in the gaming scene, and the Doc as

01:28:55.160 --> 01:29:00.000
an ambitious and outspoken persona looking for a medium that supported his antics.

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:04.140
Over the years, Dr Disrespect drew his channel, but also his brand, becoming an identifiable

01:29:04.140 --> 01:29:09.160
figure for those inside and outside the community, garnering a media presence like few other

01:29:09.160 --> 01:29:10.160
creators.

01:29:10.160 --> 01:29:13.920
Twitch obviously provided the platform, but Dr Disrespect did provide a standout persona

01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:18.400
in a sea of creators whose appeal was often based on other aspects of their content.

01:29:18.400 --> 01:29:22.320
That's not a discredit to them, but it's definitely a credit to the Doc, whose longevity

01:29:22.320 --> 01:29:25.400
on an ever-evolving platform seemed nearly guaranteed.

01:29:25.400 --> 01:29:30.000
When the competition picked up, and certain creators migrated to other platforms, our

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:33.920
titular character only strengthened his relationship with the website that had fostered his growth

01:29:33.920 --> 01:29:38.240
over the years, pledging his allegiance in the most binding way possible with a life-changing

01:29:38.240 --> 01:29:41.200
contract that likely produced eye-watering sums of money.

01:29:41.200 --> 01:29:45.880
In spite of his illustrious career up to this point, this was still a significant step forward,

01:29:45.880 --> 01:29:50.200
everything seemed to be going right, which was the perfect time for something to go wrong.

01:29:50.200 --> 01:29:53.720
As we've seen, there are a plethora of theories for what exactly happened, but the underlying

01:29:53.720 --> 01:29:57.680
theme of it was that Twitch likely made the judgement that that mutual benefit of their

01:29:57.680 --> 01:30:01.520
relationship had run its course, and the Doc had become a liability.

01:30:01.520 --> 01:30:05.360
Whether that was due to divergence in common goals, or a specific incident that left Twitch

01:30:05.360 --> 01:30:09.880
feeling like they had to take action is hard to entirely know, but the impact was long

01:30:09.880 --> 01:30:10.880
felt.

01:30:10.880 --> 01:30:37.200
That was the thing, regardless of who you sided with, or your own personal suspicions,

01:30:37.200 --> 01:30:40.520
there was always cause for concern, whether you felt that it was a stark reminder that

01:30:40.520 --> 01:30:44.540
Twitch could take a person's platform away without even blinking twice, or whether you

01:30:44.540 --> 01:30:48.640
felt it represented concern for how creator may have behaved, not being shielded from

01:30:48.640 --> 01:30:51.080
people who may be affected by their behaviour.

01:30:51.080 --> 01:30:55.440
This had a ripple effect on audiences, platforms, and even other businesses who were previously

01:30:55.440 --> 01:31:00.040
affiliated with the Doc, collaterally influencing not only his direct income in the moment,

01:31:00.040 --> 01:31:03.720
but also his mobility in the community, and all the perks that he'd previously derived

01:31:03.720 --> 01:31:05.080
from being a streamer.

01:31:05.080 --> 01:31:08.640
It put Dr Disrespect in a position where he could suck it up and move on, or try to

01:31:08.640 --> 01:31:25.880
fight for his place once more.

01:31:25.880 --> 01:31:29.720
In a way, he seemed to try and exploit both options, spending the first year or so rebuilding

01:31:29.720 --> 01:31:33.840
his online presence on a new platform, expanding his business avenues, and even establishing

01:31:33.840 --> 01:31:34.840
his own company.

01:31:34.840 --> 01:31:38.480
At that time, he was often quite cryptic, not really giving much during interviews,

01:31:38.480 --> 01:31:42.520
when the time was right he'd launch his lawsuit, likely playing to the visible financial

01:31:42.520 --> 01:31:45.680
damage that could be observed in the year following his banishment.

01:31:45.680 --> 01:31:49.480
We theorise on what the terms of the lawsuit could have been, but we know it probably emphasised

01:31:49.480 --> 01:31:50.680
what he had lost.

01:31:50.680 --> 01:31:54.480
Ultimately, in Dr Disrespect's ideal world, he would have made his triumph from return

01:31:54.480 --> 01:31:57.760
to Twitch, with them admitting they had made a dire mistake.

01:31:57.760 --> 01:32:01.760
However, although it was clear that the streaming platform was prepared to offer a compromise,

01:32:01.760 --> 01:32:05.320
it was not one that necessarily included his Twitch channel.

01:32:05.320 --> 01:32:10.020
Advised by legal experts with probably more experience than you and I, he took that compromise,

01:32:10.020 --> 01:32:14.000
which also entailed saying as little as possible about it, and though sometimes it feels like

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:17.200
the Doc wants to say more than he should, he's professional enough to hold his tongue

01:32:17.200 --> 01:32:19.560
and continue on the trajectory he's set for himself.

01:32:19.560 --> 01:32:23.200
It's not easy to lose something that you've spent years building, and to feel like you're

01:32:23.200 --> 01:32:26.800
going back to the start in a way is probably one of the most demoralising things that can

01:32:26.800 --> 01:32:27.800
happen.

01:32:27.840 --> 01:32:32.640
The platform, what is just another channel, is a person's lifetime work all in one space,

01:32:32.640 --> 01:32:36.520
it's hard not to be bitter about that, and honestly, I don't think anyone would have

01:32:36.520 --> 01:32:41.120
blamed him for throwing in the towel, but Dr Disrespect is no quitter, and in many ways

01:32:41.120 --> 01:32:43.680
he turned a negative into something positive.

01:32:43.680 --> 01:32:47.320
Dr Disrespect- We're gonna make a game with our pros, and we're gonna make a game with

01:32:47.320 --> 01:32:51.400
you, our community, and we think that's a different way of making a video game than

01:32:51.400 --> 01:32:56.000
anyone's ever made one before, and even though making games is really really hard,

01:32:56.000 --> 01:33:00.040
and really really challenging, we think by doing it this way, we have a really good chance

01:33:00.040 --> 01:33:01.040
of succeeding.

01:33:01.040 --> 01:33:04.400
In the past few months there has definitely been an interest towards creator-run gaming

01:33:04.400 --> 01:33:11.440
studios, 100 Thieves, OTK, and of course Midnight Society, headed by Dr Disrespect himself and

01:33:11.440 --> 01:33:14.120
using his namesake as a significant selling point.

01:33:14.120 --> 01:33:18.580
The pivot towards creator controlled games could really influence how the industry operates,

01:33:18.580 --> 01:33:22.240
the Doc is at the forefront of that, and although there has been the occasional criticism for

01:33:22.240 --> 01:33:25.960
how the studio has been operated, there's still a lot of hope and anticipation for the

01:33:25.960 --> 01:33:30.920
output of more consumer-oriented games, however the gaming studio does represent more than

01:33:30.920 --> 01:33:34.880
that, because it amplifies the Doc's reach and gives him more of a standing in a community

01:33:34.880 --> 01:33:47.200
that he had struggled in due to his lost connections with Twitch, in a way the more conspiratorial

01:33:47.200 --> 01:33:52.120
side of me sees these enterprises as Dr Disrespect's attempt to be so omnipresent that Twitch

01:33:52.120 --> 01:33:56.080
will eventually have no other option but to acknowledge him, all these people on their

01:33:56.080 --> 01:34:00.800
platform playing a game by a person they've banned, attending his tournaments, he can't

01:34:00.800 --> 01:34:05.240
be shunned from the industry when he is the industry, wouldn't that be the sweetest

01:34:05.240 --> 01:34:06.240
revenge?

01:34:06.240 --> 01:34:10.300
I don't know, and I don't know if Twitch cares about it that much, but going forward

01:34:10.300 --> 01:34:14.680
one can't help but wonder if their paths will cross once more, and how exactly it will

01:34:14.680 --> 01:34:15.680
be navigated.

01:34:15.680 --> 01:34:22.040
All I can say is that both Twitch and Dr Disrespect seem determined to get their share, how success

01:34:22.040 --> 01:34:24.760
all they are is a story only time will tell.

01:34:24.760 --> 01:34:28.760
It's fair to say that the mystery of Dr Disrespect's disappearance from Twitch may

01:34:28.760 --> 01:34:33.640
never be solved, a man at the peak of his popularity having the rug pulled from under

01:34:33.640 --> 01:34:39.560
him so unexpectedly, an abundance of theories that never quite unscrambled the enigma, and

01:34:39.560 --> 01:34:43.760
a court case that only mystified the facts, but within that mystery there was a nugget

01:34:43.760 --> 01:34:48.800
of truth, that whatever the setback, even one where you lose your whole damn channel,

01:34:49.040 --> 01:34:53.840
it's never completely over, and for many, Dr Disrespect is still just getting started.

01:34:53.840 --> 01:35:00.240
Let's climb the mountain, let's dominate, violence, speed, and momentum, and guess what?

01:35:00.240 --> 01:35:07.400
We're at the tip of the top of the mountain, but we're really, but we're really only halfway

01:35:07.400 --> 01:35:08.400
up.

01:35:08.400 --> 01:35:10.320
Let's do it baby!

01:35:18.800 --> 01:35:29.400
