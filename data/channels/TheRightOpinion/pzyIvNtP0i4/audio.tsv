0	9780	Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time,
9780	16580	and many of you are likely well acquainted with my established status as a gamer, in fact probably one of the best gamers there is out there.
16580	22820	Truth is, I only don't compete in tournaments because I'd really hate to put any of these so-called competitive players out of a job,
22820	26860	especially when I am so blessed to have alternative sources of entertainment.
26920	32460	Yes, my field of interest isn't merely restricted to one meadow. You see, like most people, I love a good mystery,
32460	38460	and today we have nothing less than one of the online world's strangest happenings, one that has baffled observers,
38460	41920	and even after its resolution, left far more questions than answers.
41920	49060	Nonetheless, whereas most of our topics are embroilments on our resident platform, we have to turn our attention to our YouTube's contemporaries,
49060	53220	and dare I say it, competitors for today's situation, Twitch.
53340	59660	Twitch, like YouTube, is a video sharing platform, where one can tune in to their favourite creators and view various genres of content.
59660	65900	However, unlike YouTube, Twitch's format prioritises live streams, which often provides more direct interaction between a creator,
65900	72420	the content, and their audience. It's fair to say that YouTube also offers this feature, and most people have taken advantage of it at some point,
72420	78700	however as YouTube isn't thought to provide the same attention to it that Twitch does, most tend to opt the latter when it comes to streaming.
78740	83740	With that said, Twitch isn't without its issues either, many of which have been on display in the last few years,
83740	88220	particularly their policy which has often led to accusations of hypocrisy and double standards.
91820	98540	Now with these large platforms, some sort of double standard is inevitable, particularly given the special treatment that larger creators have been known to afford.
98540	105820	With that said, Twitch's attempts to find any consistency have often led to criticisms of the opposite, and their nature to double down hasn't helped that.
105820	111580	I'm not going to detail each individual example because we'd be here all year, and that's a bit longer than I want to make my video,
111580	117740	but their lack of transparency on the matter has left some streamers believing they've been indefinitely banned for the most milk toast of faux pas,
117740	123460	and in the live stream business where there are no editing tools between the video and the viewer, that can be risky business.
123460	131220	On the other hand though, there are platform darlings, who have been welcomed back despite multiple breaches of their supposed all encompassing creator guidelines.
131300	134420	For many, there's unfairness, and then there's Twitch.
134420	140980	There are fair few theories about why Twitch is so wildly inconsistent, but I think the most deeply rooted one is that simply put, they're a business.
140980	146580	They need to hold onto the main sources of that business, especially when there are alternative platforms offering the same service.
146580	153380	If they went and banned their biggest names, even if it was for good reason, those names may just migrate to a competitor who will tolerate their antics,
153380	160500	taking all their audience and income with them. Even if it leads to greater moral inconsistency, their current practice keeps their platform afloat,
160500	167860	which is probably their prime concern. However, at the core of this pretty logically sound explanation, there is one rather significant exception to that rule,
167860	171060	so I think it's high time to introduce our title character.
171060	200180	This is Doctor Disrespect, he's a streamer with a pretty significant recurrent following, he's mostly known for playing shooters,
200180	207300	although he's not too fussy, and will play whatever takes his fancy, really. In a way, he doesn't need to specialise, because over the years, his success hasn't
207300	215700	necessarily been attributed to his in-game performance, not that it is lacking. More so, though, his on-screen persona, with a defined brand and attire to match.
215700	222740	He's always been a bit of a gamer, though, even claiming to have won Blockbuster video game tournaments in 93 and 94, back in the day.
222740	236100	I'm sitting there at the Blockbuster World Championships at Marine World in Vallejo, California, 200 tube TVs lined up, right, on all these tables, right?
236100	248260	Maybe a couple hundred people, maybe just kind of walking around the area, not sure what's going on, but it was probably the first LAN event slash tournament in the history of video games.
249220	257380	However, gaming hasn't been his only interest. In 2005, he graduated Cal Poly with a degree in business and marketing management, with a stint in the college basketball team.
257380	265380	In the years following, he dabbled in gaming, but began working behind the scenes at video game company Sledgehammer, and a live streaming website known as Justin.tv,
265380	273780	which had a pretty thriving gaming section at that time. However, in 2011, Justin TV decided to separate this section to a humble spin-off site known as Twitch,
273860	280820	and well, the rest was history there. With experience in community management, gaming, and business with some of the most media-relevant companies,
280820	286340	the doc decided to chance his arm on the other side of the stage curtains, to pretty resounding results.
286340	288340	So the winner is...
288340	306900	One thing when I started my channel, I had no idea what I was getting into. It was just having a good time. Let's just do our thing.
309140	311700	But a year and a half later, I realized a lot of things.
312580	325860	I've realized that I've provided an outlet for a lot of people that are dealing with a lot of hardships, and it makes me proud.
325860	330580	In the years coming up to 2020, our trash-talking Twitter amassed a multi-million following,
330580	336740	won numerous awards, acquired a variety of mainstream sponsorships and endorsements, and instituted himself as a force to be reckoned with.
336820	339620	However, he was not entirely unproblematic in his time.
351620	358660	Dr Disrespect was known for having a somewhat abrasive and even divisive persona, and in a way that makes sense, it's part of the appeal.
358660	367220	Javi did occasionally straggle the line between abrasiveness and offensiveness, his outspoken nature often clashing with those who disagreed with him or held disdain for his comments.
367220	376260	In 2019, he was suspended from Twitch for two weeks after he filmed inside a public restroom at the annual E3 convention, violating Twitch's own guidelines and California state law.
376260	382980	In that case, following the restoration of his channel, some perceived Doc as part of the Twitch cabal that could never face real repercussions for their mishaps.
382980	389940	As a creator with millions of followers and a cemented history at the company he represented, he was obviously going to possess some power in his channel's status.
389940	396500	At its heart, it was a synergetic relationship, one that perhaps bent the rules a little, but worked for both of the interested parties.
396500	404900	In an esports article, the author wryly commented that as long as he didn't stream from Bathroom again, it was safe to assume that the Doc won't be going anywhere in 2020.
405780	407540	How wrong they were.
407540	416340	And I'll just say this right now, champs. There's a reason why we're suing the fuck out of them, okay?
416340	426820	Yes, my friends, today's mystery will investigate the slaying and subsequent aftermath of one of Twitch's most recognisable creators, with discourse surrounding the many postulators that have arisen since that time.
426820	434260	However, to fully understand many of these discussions, it's important that we first set the scene, so allow me to take you all back to a simpler time.
434900	438420	2020. Yeah, I can't believe it was simpler than either.
438420	444820	Don't get too nostalgic, as you join me to investigate the disappearance of Dr Disrespect.
444820	449860	But you know what won't disappear? Your enjoyment of Rage Shadow Legends!
449860	460180	Rage Shadow Legends is the best game ever made. With over 600 champions and riveting AAA gameplay, you'll love Rage Shadow Legends, millions of champion combinations and endless dungeons to run through.
460180	462980	You will never need to play another game in your life.
462980	467540	I stopped eating and sleeping, why bother? I have Raid now.
467540	476100	And if you, somehow, get bored of raiding dungeons, you can beat the shit out of people in the PvP mode and become the Shadow Legend.
476100	485780	My favourite Shadow Legends are Herndig, because he is a dwarf and he can nuke everyone. I also like Gorgorra, because I mean, come on, look at him!
485780	492420	Gorbgorrib and Herndig are also married. Right now, Raid is hosting a spooky Halloween event.
492420	500180	They have plenty of in-game and IRL prizes, like a 1000 Amazon gift card! You could buy Herndig a gift with that.
500180	508660	The event only runs until November the 5th, so be sure to get the game! Go, go! What are you waiting for? Get it now!
508660	513060	If you want to consume the most influential piece of media since Homer's Odyssey,
513060	520660	then use this link in the description or the QR code screen to download the game and get a free starter pack worth $30!
520660	524900	That's $30 you can spend on Herndig!
524900	530820	You can find me raiding Shadow Legends in-game under the name The Left Opinion.
530820	540020	And if you love Herndig enough, you may even be able to join my Herndig fan club clan! See you there, gamers!
560820	569860	Now, I've already outlined the status of Dr Dispect at the start of 2020.
569860	574180	He was creating content for adoring fans, and everything seemed fairly ordinary on that front.
574180	577620	However, there had been some tension stirred between platforms around that time.
577620	583620	I've already mentioned YouTube's streaming feature, but I also noted that, as opposed to Twitch, it wasn't their primary selling point.
583620	588020	However, around this time, there was another player in the market, which had shook up the industry a little.
588020	590020	The name of this player was Mixer.
590020	594500	Mixer was a relatively new online service, launched in 2016 under the name Beam,
594500	598020	not too long after it was brought by Microsoft and rebranded for the global stage.
598020	604020	Microsoft harbored great ambitions with this platform, gradually expanding the range of available services, streaming included.
604020	610020	Arguably, though, the most significant development was in 2019, when renowned streamer Ninja, or Tyler Blevins,
610020	613300	announced he would be leaving Twitch to join Mixer on an exclusive deal.
613300	623300	I know this may come as a shock to many of you, but as of today, I will be streaming exclusively on Mixer.
623300	627540	This caused quite the commotion at the time, with many pointing the finger at a variety of sources,
627540	633140	including Twitch themselves for supposedly harbouring a toxic environment that Blevins no longer wish to tolerate.
633140	636340	Ninja was not the only streamer to leave Twitch for the market competitor, though.
636340	642260	Among others, FPS streamers Shroud, Ewok, and Kinggothalian also migrated platforms on an exclusive deal,
642260	646580	and in this time, Mixer reported a notable increase in hours of content streamed on their platform,
646580	650420	appearing to win over new and aspiring creators from their rival streaming service.
650420	655460	This would have inevitably put a squeeze on the bigwigs over at Twitch, with another platform to poach their creators,
655460	660180	they would need to approach each controversy with a heightened sensitivity to the consequences of their decisions.
660180	664660	This would obviously not be a popular decision with some, but with one of the tech behemoths breathing down their throat,
664660	666660	it seemed like the only viable option.
666660	671060	In the meantime, there were questions surrounding who the next big name would be, perhaps XQC,
671060	674340	Pokimane, or maybe Dr Disrespect.
674340	677620	Let's say a move for the doc to Mixer.
677620	684580	Let's just like theoretically say, right, the number would have to be crazy.
686260	695220	Like, I'm talking, I don't know what Ninja got, but it's got to be at Ninja's level or higher.
696580	698580	I mean, it's just a stronger brand, right?
698580	706020	It would have to be.
706020	709300	In August's stream, he appeared to have little regard for what platform he streamed on,
709300	712660	stating that his patronage would go to the highest bidder, though a few months later,
712660	716500	after the news that more streamers had left Twitch, he was confronted by audience members once more,
716500	720020	wondering if he would be part of the large exodus to the up and coming platform.
720020	722580	However, he appears to shoot these rumours down fairly swiftly,
722580	726260	using his business acumen to point out the problems with the service in reference.
726260	729540	Easy button, move to Mixer, I would never move to Mixer, trust me.
731300	731940	It's stupid.
732500	736580	Right now, they probably have maybe a total 40 to 50,000 concurrent viewers
736580	738180	across the entire platform.
738180	742660	Right now, currently on Twitch, right now, currently across the entire platform, concurrent,
742660	745700	1.5 million concurrent viewers, right?
745700	749140	So you tell me, you step into my face and say, yeah, they're making big moves.
749140	750820	No, they're not, right?
750820	756020	Like, I have double the amount of viewers that Ninja has right now, and I'm still in my intro,
756500	757620	reality check.
757620	760100	Those moves, they're not doing anything for the platform.
760100	761540	You can't pay for a community.
761540	763140	You can't buy viewership.
763140	764100	It's right here.
764100	767140	The Twitch community, it's built on video games.
767140	768820	It's built on communities.
768820	769380	And you know what?
769380	771940	The Doc's reservations were slowly being proven correct,
771940	774420	because not all was completely steady on the Mixer ship,
774420	777220	and although more content than ever was being streamed on the site,
777220	779060	the actual viewership numbers were waning,
779060	783620	and the co-founders James Berman and Matt Salsamendi left in very quick succession.
783620	786900	Although both their posts appeared to express optimism for the future of Mixer,
786900	789860	attributing their departure to a mere change in personal priorities,
789860	793140	it's hard to ignore the interrelation between the exit of these figureheads.
793140	796900	As viewer traffic is arguably the most integral element to a website in that domain,
796900	799780	the information regarding their numbers was not a good sign.
799780	804820	As a matter of fact, by the end of 2019, their market share still only equalled Facebook gaming,
804820	808420	and at that point, I'm pretty sure most people on Facebook don't even know how to use that.
808420	811460	However, though they weren't experiencing great success in that moment,
811460	814660	their presence and their ostensible ambition was enough of a threat to
814660	816980	provoke action from other players in the market.
817540	820340	This threat wasn't just limited to Mixer or YouTube either though,
820340	823780	although I joke about it, Facebook gaming did poach a couple streamers for their site,
823780	828900	and another more controversial fringe site called Dlive did sign a brief deal with PewDiePie in 2019,
828900	832980	and though that was due to expire pretty soon, it could've definitely ruffled some feathers.
832980	837220	In response to these hawkish business techniques, both Twitch and YouTube sought to cement their
837220	839220	status with a variety of commercial deals.
839220	842900	In Twitch's case, this included lucrative contracts with the creators themselves,
842900	846500	such as Pokimane, Dr. Lupo, and of course, Dr. Disrespect,
846500	849220	who in spite of pledging loyalty to the platform the year before,
849220	851780	clearly brought an inalienable presence to the network.
851780	856900	On March the 12th of 2020, Dr. Disrespect tweeted out a video from his account,
856900	861940	promoting the stream platform once more, and emphasizing the exclusivity of his presence,
861940	863220	only on Twitch.
863220	869060	You know the biggest difference between me and you boys?
870340	883220	Is that I can fly without a suit.
883220	896100	The contract was for two years, and although no specific figures were disclosed,
896100	899140	it was definitely no Mickey Mouse Monopoly money to say the least.
899140	903300	In interviews, the doc himself described it as life-changing, and it made perfect sense.
903300	907220	It was true he was one of their most successful streamers, but he was more than that in a way.
907220	909140	I mean, it's just a stronger brand, right?
909140	914340	A lot of the most viewed streamers are defined by their in-game skill,
914340	916660	or just on the basis of the content they engage with,
916660	919300	especially those in the more reaction-oriented genre.
919300	922420	The problem is that when your success is based on the relevance of the game,
922420	925540	or videos that fuel your content, you're often placing an expiry date
925540	929540	when those games or those videos fall out of favour with the greater audience.
929540	933700	Dr. Disrespect was more than that, he was a character, a divisive one for sure,
933700	937060	but you don't garner prestige a lot of the time without making a few enemies,
937060	940260	and sometimes it's better as a creator to evoke a strong reaction,
940260	943540	positive or negative, because it's what will keep some people coming back.
943540	946020	Sure, when he dropped a hot take or just another streamer,
946020	949700	it would typically end up in an article, even drawing some negative press towards him,
949700	952100	but he was always described as the Twitch streamer,
952100	956500	and if any coverage was good coverage, then he was the prime example of that.
956500	959940	I think Twitch identified the longevity in Dr. Disrespect's appeal,
959940	961700	and sought to secure it on their platform.
961700	963780	With the competition gearing up for the new year,
963780	967460	it made perfect sense that they retained one of their most identifiable creators,
967460	969060	what could ever change that?
969060	970500	Well, I don't know.
971380	973380	Okay, that's the part over,
973380	977620	and if you chose to listen to audio for that part, you may now resume watching, hopefully.
987940	990820	June 2020 was a chaotic month to say the least,
990820	994180	for everyone who could possibly be involved in this serpentine story.
994180	997780	Despite their strong corporate foundations, Mixer was faltering in views.
997780	1001380	A March report showed that although livestream viewership had doubled over the year before,
1001380	1006740	Mixer's growth tally at 0.2%, which with their exorbitant financial deals considered,
1006740	1008980	was nothing less than astounding.
1008980	1010180	Astoundingly bad.
1010180	1014020	When June came around, they appeared to be coming to terms with the fact that their platform
1014020	1017620	was not sustainable with its expenditure, and on the 22nd of June,
1017620	1019780	Mixer announced they were shutting down.
1019780	1021380	This should have been great news for Twitch,
1021380	1024820	who could recapture some of their creators who had previously exited the platform.
1024820	1029140	However, this positive news was also being overshadowed by a series of criticism directed
1029140	1032740	at Twitch and prominent gaming figures from female streamers who believe that Twitch's
1032740	1036020	current system enabled misogyny and harassment on the platform,
1036020	1040740	with many female streamers sharing their stories of unsavoury experiences with those in the industry.
1040740	1043940	With the CEO pledging to listen and cooperate in every way possible,
1043940	1047540	it was a pretty challenging time for the platform and the online community as a whole,
1047540	1051300	but all seemed committed to seeing it through, with new policy designed to take permanent
1051300	1054340	action against those who had committed these misdeeds in reference.
1054340	1058260	Earlier in the month, Twitch had also been under pressure following a series of DMCA takedowns
1058260	1062180	issued against a variety of channels relating to copyrighted music being used in streams,
1062180	1065780	and their potential legal liability, with their company's Twitter account posting a
1065780	1068180	statement expressing respect for these laws.
1068180	1072340	Dr Dispect was not someone whose name had been included amongst any of these discussions,
1072340	1075700	and overall there was no controversy surrounding him at this time.
1075780	1079140	In the months before, he had been involved in a few incidents, most notably regarding
1079140	1082500	content he'd shared during the start of COVID that many felt was inaccurate.
1082500	1086260	Needless to say, though, he's not a medical doctor, so most of the time what he said didn't
1086260	1089700	seem to have any staying power outside a few response articles and tweets.
1089700	1094180	Dr Dispect was arguably the last person to have any eyes cast on him at this time.
1094180	1098660	He wasn't a part of any known narratives, he had distanced himself from Mix and other competitors,
1098660	1103380	all while maintaining a steady schedule and viewership on the website that adoringly hosted him.
1103380	1107540	Yet on the 26th of June 2020, all of that seemed to turn on its head.
1115300	1118820	Yes, without even the slightest of warnings, announcements, or messages,
1118820	1123620	Dr Disrespect's Twitch page went dark, and for the first day left people scrambling for an
1123620	1125460	explanation on what exactly happened.
1125460	1128340	Twitch would not comment, and some were questioning whether he'd even been banned
1128340	1130100	because of the lack of commentary around it.
1130100	1134260	The day after, video games journalist Rod Slasher-Breslau claimed that he had been informed
1134260	1138660	as to why the doc had his platform withdrawn, but considered the reasons too legally sensitive
1138660	1139940	to disclose at this point.
1139940	1144100	He was one of the first to break the news of Dr Disrespect's permanent ban, and his background
1144100	1146660	in journalism seemed to give him some authority on the matter.
1146660	1150580	However, he was not the only person to claim to be in the know, though nobody who did seemed
1150580	1154820	interested in sharing this knowledge, making this whole premise somewhat dubious.
1154820	1158580	On the same day, Twitch released a statement to CNN's Shannon Lau stating that they took
1158580	1163140	appropriate action in response to a violation of their community guidelines, as is their
1163140	1163620	process.
1164180	1167700	Not the most believable given their track record, but maybe they had a good reason.
1167700	1171540	However, the day after, the doc himself tweeted that he had been given no reason from Twitch
1171540	1175620	as to why he had been banned, and if Dr Disrespect wasn't going to find out, then there was no
1175620	1179700	chance that any of the wider audiences were going to find out any time soon either.
1179700	1183460	On the same day, Disrespect's final minutes from his last stream on Twitch were uploaded
1183460	1187220	to YouTube, prompting many viewers to comb through to try and find any indication or
1187220	1188900	foreshadowing of the trouble that followed.
1191060	1194740	With that said, I have yet to see someone.
1199380	1201140	That's on my fucking level, baby.
1201780	1206020	Many viewers seem to note that Doc's demeanor visibly altered after the two-minute mark,
1206020	1209380	where he appears to check his phone following what was a presumed notification.
1217220	1225460	So I should just put it on just chatting.
1225460	1228100	I mean, like, I kind of wanted to get off, but now I don't want to get off.
1228740	1233220	He goes on a brief inspirational spiel about his fan base and how they gotta stay resolute,
1233220	1237540	before going off on a tangent about David Icke, a former footballer and commentator turned
1237540	1241060	conspiracy theorist, who advocates for the idea that the world has been taken over by
1241060	1245300	reptilian elites who are veering the world towards a global fascism hell-bent on eliminating
1245300	1246260	all human freedoms.
1246980	1248100	David Icke.
1248100	1249220	Yes, Alex.
1249220	1251140	Yes, I like him.
1253140	1257380	All it allows you to do is just sort of like, you know, allows you to step outside of the
1257380	1258340	box just a little bit.
1259780	1263780	It could recently been censored on a variety of online platforms in response to his claims.
1263780	1268740	However, the Doc vocalizes his admiration of it's outside of the box thinking, a strange
1268740	1272740	turn of discourse, but not completely unfeasible, though,
1273620	1279620	Whether some of the stuff is not true or not, whatever, I think the whole, the whole goal, though, is
1283060	1284100	to wake up!
1289940	1290440	Yeah.
1290820	1294820	Anyhow, someone recommends he play Roblox Hide and Seek next stream in his chat.
1294820	1299060	The Doc seems to pull it up, engage with some YouTube content on it, and maintain a rather
1299700	1303380	stoic expression, only breaking the science to once more promote David Icke.
1303380	1307220	He then appears to break character to talk directly to his fans with more motivational
1307220	1310900	language and acknowledgement of some sort of unspecified challenge in his life.
1312420	1313780	I appreciate everyone watching today.
1313780	1314740	Who is it in the backyard?
1314740	1316180	Who is going to be looking?
1316180	1320420	We'll get through this Champions Club.
1321380	1324500	I know it's a tough, life's weird right now.
1325700	1328980	Who knows what he's exactly referring to, but before we know it, he appears to be in
1329620	1332260	drops a cheeky expletive and cuts the credits in.
1340420	1344020	Unsurprisingly, with a fair bit out of the ordinary going on here, many people began
1344020	1348100	to speculate, some more reasonable, some a little more far-fetched, but it represented
1348100	1350340	the uncertainty in the Doc's world at this moment.
1350340	1353780	He said he didn't know the reason for the ban, but there seems to be some recognition
1353780	1357380	of an obstacle that appears to be troubling him during the stream, and the rather chaotic
1357380	1361060	ending left many wondering if he'd been arrested, or an even worse fate had befallen
1361060	1364820	him, with Twitch being able to act accordingly with whichever authorities requested them
1364820	1365140	to.
1365140	1368500	However, in the days following, no reports were released that corroborated this theory,
1368500	1371300	and Dr Disrespect seemed to be at least alive.
1371300	1375220	However, this didn't provide clarity for those seeking it, and if anyone was expecting
1375220	1378420	a further explanation anytime soon, they were not going to receive it.
1378420	1382100	The permanence of this ban was seemingly confirmed when Twitch refunded viewer's subscription
1382100	1384660	to the Doc's channel, and eliminated his emotes.
1385220	1389540	In the space of a few days, the seas of chaos and controversy seemed to part for this one
1389540	1392900	man, and his unrevealed breach of Twitch's conditions.
1392900	1396820	So much was changing around the Doc in that moment that it was hard to assign a causality
1396820	1400900	to anything clear, and although some had some pretty solid theories, there was a lack of
1400900	1403620	confirmation that planted the seed of uncertainty.
1403620	1405700	Would the silence ever be broken?
1405700	1407220	Well, let's find out.
1407220	1416180	Over the following weeks, there was silence from the parties involved, some articles were
1416180	1418820	published, and some hypotheses shared on the Doc's fate.
1418820	1422980	Yet most of this was hearsay, and with nobody willing to speak on the matter, very little
1422980	1424180	progress was made.
1424180	1428500	How this changed around mid-July, when our friendly PC physician decided to publish a
1428500	1430660	somewhat foreboding trailer onto his Twitter.
1437220	1457700	There's not really too much to read into here, but I think everyone figured that the
1457700	1459220	Doc had unfinished business.
1459220	1463700	On the same day, he granted interviews to both PC Gamer and the Washington Post relating
1463700	1467620	to the state of affairs that concerned his removal and the aftermath, including possible
1467620	1468620	causes of action.
1468620	1472540	In these interviews, disrespect continues to emphasise that he is still none the wiser
1472540	1476500	as to why Twitch terminated his contract, however, he seems reluctant to entertain any
1476500	1479300	theories or provide any further details on his perspective.
1479300	1483020	At one point in the PC Gamer interview, he begins responding to a question about the
1483020	1487180	stream comments that touched on COVID misinformation, however, before he can elaborate on what he
1487180	1491380	thinks, he's interrupted by his publicist who believes they're entering risky territory,
1491380	1493180	and the question is shut down.
1493180	1496420	One of the most significant details revealed in these interviews was that the Doc was seeking
1496420	1500460	counsel for possible legal action, far the reason why he is not particularly forthcoming
1500460	1503260	with many details relating to his ban as of then.
1503260	1507100	One thing he does want to distance himself from is the behaviour in his final stream,
1507100	1510820	affirming that the two incidents are unrelated, and that he was just feeling the pressure
1510820	1513020	from the world around him at that moment.
1513020	1516820	He acknowledges it was a curious coincidence, but assures interviewers that he was genuinely
1516820	1520260	ignorant to what was about to transpire, and that he still is.
1520260	1523500	It's hard to fully take his word at face value, but there isn't really much else
1523500	1526820	to take at this point, so this is the best that most could settle for.
1526820	1530420	There was another lull in developments, with the occasional crypto post here and there.
1530420	1534980	On July 22nd, a few days after the interviews, one of Dr Disrespect's top Discord mods
1534980	1538480	shared an old message which seemed to imply that something was in the works, though no
1538480	1540100	further specifics were provided.
1540100	1544780	Lo and behold though, barely a fortnight later, the prophecies were fulfilled, with a Twitter
1544780	1547700	post from the Doc himself announcing his return.
1547700	1551820	Tomorrow we arrive, with a link to a video uploaded to YouTube.
1577940	1581820	Now with his previous video also being uploaded onto YouTube, some had already thought this
1581820	1585940	would be the platform of choice, but this seemed to confirm it even if it wasn't outwardly
1585940	1586940	stated.
1586940	1590620	The second was a music video accompanying a song by Jplus1, a regular collaborator with
1590620	1593220	the Doc, in which he seems to provide the vocals here.
1593220	1597060	The lyrics include the line, I don't even know why I try anymore, repeated multiple
1597060	1600820	times, and you can't replace me, remarks that seem applicable to Twitch's recent
1600820	1602300	measures taken against him.
1602300	1606560	In this video he's seen in a dark room, looking over an inclement skyline, while serenading
1606560	1609760	the bright lights, reaching out but never quite reaching them.
1609760	1613680	Ok, I'll try not to get too artsy here, but there seems to be a lot of subliminal messages
1613680	1618760	on show, but the most important one was the tweet itself, referring to tomorrow.
1618760	1622880	This was the date set for his grand return, with many anticipating what he might finally
1622880	1627320	reveal now he has a platform once more, albeit a new one.
1627320	1628320	What would he say?
1628360	1630360	We have no idea.
1636400	1639440	And I'm gonna tell you this right now.
1639440	1647600	As far as I'm concerned, we didn't do anything to warrant a ban, let alone how they went
1647600	1650040	about banning us.
1650040	1655320	No communication before, no reaching out, nothing.
1655320	1656320	Boom.
1656320	1657320	Done.
1657320	1661040	Well, nothing particularly new in its core message, that boils down to the fact that
1661040	1664560	he still doesn't know what he has done wrong, and that it had not been communicated to him,
1664560	1667720	but it's certainly a lot more convincing when delivered with the trademark bravado
1667720	1669640	that people had come to know the doc for.
1669640	1673000	He also once more criticises those who have jumped to conclusions on the nature of his
1673000	1677780	ban, expressing understanding that although people may be looking for an answer, sometimes
1677780	1682000	one doesn't come too easily, and that he'd be best left with the professionals for now.
1682000	1693880	The problem is too, there's people in the community that are anxious for an answer.
1693880	1704680	So what that does, it creates a level of urgency and speculation.
1704680	1706800	And I think it's just a fucking cockroach approach.
1706800	1710920	There's big money involved.
1710920	1717160	So let the legal professionals do what they need to do, that's it.
1717160	1720440	Now this is a fair way to close discussion on the matter for the moment, he is a streamer
1720440	1724280	with his own persona to maintain, he can't let this drama be the defining aspect of his
1724280	1728080	long and illustrious career, however, his response is also revealing in the fact that
1728080	1731780	it shows he's still exploring legal options, and clearly believes he may have a strong
1731780	1735620	case to make for himself, provided what he said in that moment is the case, then of course
1735620	1736620	he would.
1736620	1740340	However, I wouldn't be giving the stream it's due credit if I focused on a rather
1740340	1745780	derisory portion of it, let me make this clear, this video is more than that, it's a stone
1745780	1751700	cold statement, you all better pay some fucking attention, because Dr Disrespect was back,
1751700	1754420	and this time he was intent on not going anywhere.
1754420	1760700	I'm gonna stay here and watch him on the screen the whole time, I'm gonna wait right
1760700	1765780	here underneath the fucking staircase, and I'm gonna wait, and I'm gonna screen watch,
1765780	1769140	I'm gonna stare at him, and I'm gonna-
1769140	1773300	With his duration exceeding an entire day, and review counts surpassing seven million,
1773300	1777200	the doc buckled down to some classic gamer antics providing the fans more of what they
1777200	1781600	knew him for, and the bunches of video games, banter, and one-liners to boot.
1781600	1784920	Unfortunately, due to it's protracted length, the video is no longer available to watch
1784920	1788660	in it's entirety, though the doc did upload a little highlight reel for all those who
1788660	1790860	missed the first stage of his new journey.
1790860	1794160	You can also find parts of the stream on other channels that caught it, so you can enjoy
1794160	1796040	the moment one more time.
1796040	1804460	I ain't coming, I ain't coming back.
1804460	1808820	This felt good in many ways for his audience, this was his homecoming, sure, it was a new
1808820	1813340	home, but it was the same furniture, it was a new chapter, yet the same book.
1813340	1818180	Over the year, he grew his view base on YouTube, continuing his collaboration with other creators
1818180	1822560	and studios, even appearing to plan his own entry into the video games market.
1822560	1826260	Everything was progressing fairly smoothly, and the instant the doc described as a speed
1826260	1832360	bump seemed to be firmly in the rear view mirror, and yet, in spite of this, he couldn't
1832360	1833360	stop glancing back.
1833360	1845620	Don't be mistaken, there was a lot to celebrate for members of the Champions Club, however
1845620	1847960	this was also still deeply bittersweet.
1847960	1851700	Although he had found a new platform, the legacy of the past controversy still casts
1851700	1853400	a long and dark shadow.
1853400	1857580	I know nobody's probably gonna shed a tear over the state of his finances, the dude probably
1857580	1861980	does alright for himself, but proportionally speaking, he loves a lot, and a channel.
1861980	1865940	It still holds a lot of emotional value, value that he clearly felt attached to.
1891980	1898920	This was something unprecedented for him, let alone everyone else, and he wanted closure.
1898920	1900420	How was he going to do that?
1900420	1901420	Well…
1901420	1911900	Uh, whether it's obvious or not, the blacklisting, the shadow banning, it's happening, as well
1911900	1921580	as you think we're doing, and I think, again, we're doing well enough, I'll tell you man,
1921580	1927240	it's been extremely disheartening, it's been a rollercoaster of emotion, and it absolutely
1927240	1928240	fucking sucks.
1928360	1932520	Over a year passed since any progress on legal proceedings had been announced, and for some
1932520	1937160	the case had probably gone cold, however in August of 2021, while responding to a question
1937160	1941080	in a fairly casual stream, the doc had some news to impart for his eager viewers.
1941080	1945020	After talking about how his Twitch ban had impacted him, and his business, he revealed
1945020	1946920	some new information regarding his ban.
1946920	1951020	But a lot of people ask me, do you know the reason, yeah, I do know the reason why now,
1951020	1957480	I've known for months now, the reason why, and I'll just say this right now champs,
1957520	1963480	there's a reason why we're suing the fuck out of him, okay?
1963480	1972120	I don't know how else to put it, the amount of damages, and you just don't, nah, nah,
1972120	1981720	um, gotta, I can, I, I, I, anyways.
1981720	1986200	This was the first time that Dr Disrespect publicly stated he knew why he had been banned,
1986240	1988560	alongside the fact that he was taking legal action.
1988560	1993000	It was only a single sentence, but news outlets rushed to cover it with a plethora of postulations
1993000	1997560	about the rationale behind this decision, however if he initiated a lawsuit, one thing
1997560	2000640	was true, he believed he had a case.
2000640	2002840	What did that case constitute?
2002840	2006680	Well my friends, I think it's high time we bring in our resident Twitch expert into
2006680	2011560	this discussion as well, and I know what you're thinking, you have a resident Twitch expert,
2011560	2013420	how come we've never met him?
2013420	2017420	Well he's a hardworking guy, and he's also allowed only one hour of sunlight a week,
2017420	2021060	so if he exceeds that in this video, we'll be having works.
2021060	2025500	Ladies, gentlemen, and all far and wide, allow me to introduce you to my good friend Poutine,
2025500	2030340	who will be looking into Twitch's legal liabilities, and the prospective case our streamer friend
2030340	2033420	possessed, take it away my man.
2033420	2038060	When I first learned about Dr Disrespect's ban, like many others I was baffled, how could
2038060	2042120	Twitch ban one of their biggest creators, and not even tell them why?
2042120	2046720	After a couple years of streaming on Twitch, that answer has become a lot more clear.
2046720	2051100	One thing you need to understand about Twitch is they care a lot about maintaining a professional
2051100	2052280	public image.
2052280	2056960	The last thing Twitch wants is to be seen caught up in some petty drama regarding somebody's
2056960	2057960	ban.
2057960	2062680	As a result, they've created PR and support teams that rival YouTube and how unhelpful
2062680	2064080	and robotic they can be.
2064080	2068920	Their policy when banning streamers, regardless of size or context, is not to make comments
2068920	2071560	of any kind, public or private.
2071560	2075640	This includes giving streamers themselves specific reasons for their ban.
2075640	2080040	For example, Twitch used to send out templates that looked like this whenever somebody got
2080040	2081040	banned.
2081040	2083980	If you were lucky, a vague reason would be given, with a simple link to their community
2083980	2086600	guidelines to, quote, learn more.
2086600	2090120	If you weren't so lucky, sometimes you wouldn't be given a reason at all.
2090120	2094960	The fate of any wrongdoers on the platform is decided by a very small, completely anonymous
2094960	2098800	moderation team, and they have notoriously tight lips.
2099040	2103560	Not being given a reason for his ban wasn't an exception, it was the rule.
2103560	2107560	It feels like every month there's a new streamer getting banned without a clear reason,
2107560	2112240	and beyond making a few tweets, most take this sort of treatment sitting down.
2112240	2113840	But not the doc.
2113840	2119000	He had something so strong it was worth suing a multi-billion dollar company over.
2119000	2120000	What was it?
2120000	2122840	I've spent the past week reading California state law.
2122840	2125600	That is to say, it's not been a very fun week.
2125600	2127360	And I think I've narrowed it down.
2127360	2132520	Before we understand Dr. Disrespect's lawsuit, we first need to understand how Twitch's
2132520	2133520	contracts work.
2133520	2137080	On YouTube, there's one partner program for everybody on the platform.
2137080	2140040	Twitch, on the other hand, has a multi-tiered system.
2140040	2144440	On the lowest levels are affiliates, above them are partners, and above them is a more
2144440	2148860	secretive tier of top creators who have personalized contracts with Twitch.
2148860	2152820	In order to get one of these more exclusive contracts, streamers often negotiate directly
2152820	2157120	with Twitch for things like higher revenue splits and a flat payout for streaming a certain
2157200	2158560	number of hours every month.
2158560	2162160	Dr. Disrespect no doubt had one of these contracts.
2162160	2166160	With that in mind, the first conclusion many people came to regarding the lawsuit was a
2166160	2168040	breach of that contract.
2168040	2172080	Perhaps Twitch had in some way violated the terms of their own contract.
2172080	2173920	Now I'm gonna level with you here.
2173920	2177480	Knowing the specifics of Doc's contract is virtually impossible.
2177480	2180360	Twitch keeps all of their agreements under NDA.
2180360	2183560	But that doesn't mean we have nothing to go off of.
2183560	2188680	Going into 2016, James Varga, better known as Phantom Lord, was on the top of his career.
2188680	2193360	You might not know his name today, but he was once the most followed streamer on Twitch.
2193360	2197880	He would routinely stream himself gambling CSGO skins on several different sites and
2197880	2198880	winning big.
2198880	2203320	Unfortunately for him, it came out that one of these sites was not only rigged in his
2203320	2205840	favor but it was created by him.
2205840	2209520	For Twitch, this was the last straw as he had already violated their terms of service
2209520	2214840	in the past, and I'm guessing the whole running in a legal gambling operation thing
2214840	2216840	probably didn't really help his case.
2216840	2221840	Phantom Lord was banned in July of that year, and two years later in early 2018, Phantom
2221840	2224000	Lord filed a lawsuit against Twitch.
2224000	2229440	He was suing them for violating California's unfair competition laws, breach of contract,
2229440	2232320	and intentional and negligent misrepresentation.
2232320	2245000	Unlike Dr. Disrespect, Phantom Lord claimed he was entitled to millions.
2245000	2247800	We can break down his claims into one of two categories.
2247800	2252280	Twitch violated specific terms of their contract, and Twitch mishandled the ban, causing damages
2252280	2253280	to Phantom Lord.
2253280	2255760	For the first category, the court sided with Phantom Lord.
2255760	2259960	Within his contract was a provision that guaranteed him 30 days notice if Twitch were to ban him.
2259960	2264040	Twitch failed to do this and was ordered to pay just over $20,000 as a result.
2264040	2267360	The second category, however, was a different story altogether.
2267360	2271520	While it was obvious to many in the public why Phantom Lord had been banned, Twitch hadn't
2271520	2275000	explicitly given him a reason until five months afterward.
2275000	2276000	Sound familiar?
2276000	2280040	When he finally got through to a Twitch representative, he was told the ban was the result of fraudulent
2280040	2284620	payments being made to his channel, an allegation that many in the media were already acutely
2284620	2285620	aware of.
2285620	2289040	The reason for his ban was later seemingly changed to reflect the gambling site scam
2289120	2291400	he ran, among other guideline violations.
2291400	2294680	He argues that Twitch misrepresented their terms of service to him, and that by banning
2294680	2298400	him in the manner they did, Twitch's business practices are unfair.
2298400	2302340	The courts agreed with some aspects of his claims, but ultimately sided with Twitch and
2302340	2305000	Phantom Lord was never unbanned.
2305000	2309400	On paper, Phantom Lord came out on top, $20,000 richer.
2309400	2313560	But it's important to point out that this lawsuit lasted for over three years, and it
2313560	2317380	didn't get anywhere near the millions of dollars he claimed he was owed.
2317380	2321020	Given that this case was the closest legal battle to what Dr. Disrespect was about to
2321020	2325140	go through, and Twitch had no doubt changed their contract since, the odds of winning
2325140	2328580	anything substantial must have seemed slim at best.
2328580	2331900	But Doc still had one more ace up his sleeve.
2331900	2336480	You see, when Twitch terminated their contract with Doc, he lost a lot more than just what
2336480	2338100	that contract entailed.
2338100	2342220	Third party sponsors and events immediately backed out of any deals with him, seemingly
2342220	2346460	out of a fear of association, despite not even knowing why he was banned in the first
2346460	2368980	place.
2368980	2373740	Speculation ran wild, and the safest thing for these brands to do was to distance themselves.
2373740	2376900	From the outside looking in, there was a degree of weight to Doc's ban.
2376900	2380660	It seemed so serious that nobody felt comfortable even discussing it.
2380660	2385320	I mean, maybe the reason for the ban was trivial, but none of these brands wanted to stick around
2385320	2386320	and find out.
2386320	2390580	Doc losing these deals in partnerships that were made independently of Twitch as a result
2390580	2394180	of how Twitch handled things seems a bit unfair.
2394180	2397460	But it's more than just unfair, it's illegal.
2397460	2403140	Tort is a category of civil law that focuses on emotional, physical, or economic damages
2403140	2404140	caused.
2404140	2409220	Within this category is something called negligent interference with prospective economic relations.
2409220	2412160	This complete jumble of words was his golden ticket.
2412160	2416700	While simple contract violations got Phantom Lord twenty thousand dollars, this could get
2416700	2419020	Doc a whole lot more.
2419020	2423160	In order to win the lawsuit in California, where Twitch is based, Doc would have to prove
2423160	2424160	eight points.
2424160	2427600	First, that there was a relationship between him and his sponsor, with the possibility
2427600	2431940	of future income, that Twitch knew about this relationship, that Twitch knew Doc's relationship
2431940	2437220	would be damaged if they failed to act with reasonable care, that Twitch did not act with
2437220	2441020	reasonable care, that Twitch engaged in wrongful conduct.
2441020	2444740	This one is a bit of a mystery, but it could be a number of things, from breach of contract
2444740	2449620	to slander or misrepresentation, or any other wrongful act that Twitch might have done towards
2449620	2451300	Doc relating to his ban.
2451300	2455540	That Doc's relationship with his sponsor was actually damaged, and that Doc was economically
2455540	2456860	harmed as a result.
2456860	2460460	It would be easy to argue that Twitch knew about his sponsorships, and knew banning Doc
2460460	2463420	in such a secretive manner would harm those sponsorships.
2463420	2467580	Instead of clarifying the reason for the ban, Twitch allowed theories to run wild.
2467580	2472060	I don't know about you, but to me, this doesn't seem like reasonable care to somebody who
2472060	2474100	was one of their biggest creators.
2474100	2478420	And if the courts agreed, millions of dollars in damages were on the table.
2478420	2482540	In Phantom Lord's case, his lawyers did mention that Twitch caused him serious monetary and
2482540	2486860	reputational damage, but interestingly, they didn't seem to pursue those claims further,
2486860	2491060	possibly because they knew his reputation and job opportunities were already damaged
2491060	2494860	before the ban by countless articles and videos documenting his actions.
2494860	2498140	In short, he burned those bridges just fine without any help from Twitch.
2498140	2500900	The same can't be said for Dr. Disrespect, however.
2500900	2504700	In his case, the ban blindsided both his partners and the public alike.
2504700	2508900	Look, I'll be the first to admit, there's no shortage of reasons to sue somebody in
2508900	2509900	the US.
2509900	2514580	And to be honest with you, Doc could be suing Twitch for pretty much anything, but if Doc
2514580	2518740	had any real chance of getting the millions of dollars he claimed Twitch took from him,
2518740	2523060	it was in this convoluted and wordy section of California law.
2523060	2525540	The road ahead did not look easy for Doc.
2525540	2529240	He was going up against one of the biggest companies in the world, with one of the most
2529240	2531380	well-funded legal teams.
2531380	2536460	Despite this, he was confident, though it remained to be seen if this confidence was
2536460	2537460	misplaced.
2537460	2543420	Wow, what an eloquently spoken chap, only a true genius would have the artistic inspiration
2543420	2545220	to feature them in a video of theirs.
2545220	2548300	Anyhow, I shan't stand on ceremony any further.
2548300	2552940	Regardless of the specifics, Dr. Disrespect believed he had a case, and with the details
2552940	2557620	behind this exclusive contract, it's understandable why he held that belief, but belief is only
2557620	2559000	half the battle.
2559000	2562100	Those looking at his case would need to share his perspective, and when dealing with these
2562100	2565580	online situations, there's often an element of unpredictability.
2565580	2569260	Nevertheless, going into the new year, his resolutions were a bit more ambitious.
2569260	2573420	At the start of this saga, he expressed no intent on returning to Twitch following his
2573420	2578720	ban, however entering 2022, this had changed, with a large payout and a grand return part
2578720	2580000	of his yearly aims.
2580000	2584300	He clearly had an expectation that this lawsuit would yield a favourable result for him, and
2584300	2588260	given the far reaching impact that his rejection had onto his finances, if the grounds for
2588260	2592620	his removal were found to be unfounded, then surely he would be entitled to serious compensation.
2592620	2596580	And we've gotten to such a good point, ladies and gentlemen, Champions Club, we got to such
2596580	2597580	a good point.
2597580	2604360	I mean, I'm talking all cylinders firing, the conscious just feels extremely just incredible.
2604360	2608280	And then to have that taken away from you, and to not know why, and to not know anything
2608280	2614200	about it, not to be told nothing, boom, taken, grabbed, everything we built, all the eggs
2614200	2616480	in one bucket, boom, taken away.
2616480	2620520	The fact that I am here live on YouTube, it's been a fantastic return, I'm telling you,
2620520	2621520	it is.
2621520	2627260	The anxiety levels, it's something that comes in these huge waves, and I'm having a hard
2627260	2630340	time dealing with it, I'll be honest.
2630340	2633060	However, did Twitch have a case to make as well?
2633060	2636880	Dr Disrespect always pushed the boundaries of what was acceptable on the platform, and
2636880	2640660	even if it wasn't their honest reason for banning him, could they refer to these incidents
2640660	2645340	as factors for nullifying a contract, and find loopholes with such a known provocateur?
2645340	2648720	The fact that Twitch weren't just taking it lying down seemed to imply that they also
2648720	2652540	believed they had a case too, but what was the reality?
2652540	2656780	Well after a couple months of further litigation, an announcement was made on behalf of both
2656780	2658640	Dr Disrespect and Twitch.
2658640	2663080	These statements were nearly identical, both conveying that the parties had come to a settlement,
2663080	2665900	although neither of them admit any fault for their part.
2665900	2670020	In a way, this result is not surprising, lawsuits can be lengthy and arduous, incurring great
2670020	2673980	costs for all, and if conditions that each person involved is satisfied with can be agreed
2673980	2678060	upon, then that is nearly always more preferable than rolling the dice in court.
2678060	2681800	However, in a follow up comment to his initial statement, the doc clarifies he will not be
2681800	2686440	returning to Twitch, seemingly contradicting his post a couple months prior.
2686440	2690620	Had anything changed in that time, or was his case not quite as strong as he believed
2690620	2691620	it to be?
2691620	2695720	While it's hard to read too much into it, on the surface, some might assume Dr Disrespect's
2695720	2698300	case wasn't compelling enough for him to follow through on.
2698300	2702040	We know he perceives Twitch as the superior platform for streaming, and as a long term
2702040	2706240	result his return to the platform may have been financially preferable given his impressive
2706240	2707240	viewership.
2707240	2711660	Trudy noted another lawsuit that resulted in a plaintiff victory yielded an amount that
2711660	2715500	probably didn't go particularly far, and although Twitch probably did breach aspects
2715500	2719140	of their contract, this complaint probably wouldn't yield the payout that the doc was
2719140	2721280	hoping for, even if proven.
2721280	2725620	The money was in the implication of Twitch's actions, which is what the doc seemed focused
2725620	2748120	on, however, proving that would have been a
2748120	2751720	greater challenge.
2751720	2765800	As noted, some critics may have viewed the settlement as a reflection of weakness in
2765800	2770280	Dr Disrespect, or his case, after all he was not prepared to follow through with it, and
2770280	2771760	actually acquire the desired result.
2771760	2775840	However, this didn't necessarily reflect a weak case, either it depends on the details
2775840	2781080	and settlement, if the payout offered to him was large enough, he might have just taken
2781080	2783080	that deal and gone its own way.
2783080	2786580	I don't think the doc had a weak case in regards to how Twitch handled their severance
2786580	2790520	of him, they clearly dealt with it poorly, but that wasn't where the money was.
2790520	2793920	The following part is mostly theory, but I think it's worth exploring a little, and
2793920	2797500	it is based on the assumption that what the doc was banned for wasn't quite as shocking
2797500	2800000	as certain figures had suggested it was.
2800000	2804120	I think the greatest financial damage in the doc's mind came in the aftermath, and it's
2804120	2808600	persisting presence on his ability to attend events and garner sponsorships.
2808600	2811560	Anybody who's banned from Twitch is also restricted from attending events for which
2811560	2815480	Twitch may be affiliated with, and appearing on any other creator's Twitch streams.
2815480	2819560	We don't know exactly on what grounds Dr Disrespect sued, but we can estimate that
2819560	2822320	was probably in the domain that Taut allows.
2822320	2825760	Although there are few routes he could have taken, he wasted a decent amount of time to
2825760	2830000	file the lawsuit, despite exploring it from pretty much the onset of his banishment, which
2830000	2833760	would imply that they wanted to let the dust settle, and the upshot to show itself with
2833760	2834760	clarity.
2834760	2838680	At the start, some had considered the additional publicity that he received as actually a positive
2838680	2842840	result given that many people sympathised with his situation, however over time that
2842840	2847480	sympathy faded and the financial ramifications became clear because of how dominant Twitch
2847480	2849320	truly are on the market.
2849320	2853800	I mean there's a reason why Activision doesn't do a Call of Duty partner code, or we don't
2853800	2857040	work directly with Call of Duty, or haven't been.
2857080	2864640	There's so much defamation relating to the ban that we've had to deal with, it's insane.
2864640	2868280	These were strong words, but they were ones that emphasised the damage that Twitch had
2868280	2872560	caused to Dr Disrespect, he needed to drive this home to people, and he was smart about
2872560	2873560	it in many ways.
2873560	2877640	Part of me thinks that Twitch were hoping that the Dr following his ban would have angrily
2877640	2882120	taken to stream and revealed details that would have been detrimental in his court case,
2882120	2883120	but he didn't.
2883120	2886640	In interviews he focused on the damage, but in all the details he spoke about the mental
2886640	2890640	anguish, and although I have no doubt he experienced that, his focus on that was important
2890640	2894080	to drive home the point that Twitch's actions caused visible harm.
2894080	2898640	To me there was little question that Dr Disrespect had proven that Twitch's actions had tangible
2898640	2903140	negative consequences on his mobility in the industry and his own mental state in dealing
2903140	2905560	with the evolving circumstances.
2905560	2908800	Twitch played an undeniable role in this, sure they didn't want to show their hand
2908800	2912520	too soon in case people quickly countered them and undermined their reasoning for the
2912520	2913520	Dr Disrespect ban.
2913520	2917640	However in this case, as Puti noted, beyond their direct involvement with many other companies,
2917640	2921120	their ambiguity prompted uncertainty within brands who would typically partner with our
2921120	2922740	streamer friend in question.
2922740	2926700	When you're a large company, the last thing you want is someone who is an unknown quantity,
2926700	2929840	and for a while Dr Disrespect was just that.
2929840	2934320	Even brands he shared well established relationships with distanced themselves, and although some
2934320	2938640	returned in time, it was demonstrative of how ignorance could be weaponised as much
2938640	2940240	as any form of knowledge.
2940480	2945040	But surely that would depend on whether Dr Disrespect's removal from the platform was justified.
2945040	2950080	Twitch's statement on Dr Disrespect's ban, as in our process, we take appropriate action
2950080	2954140	when we have evidence that a streamer has acted in violation of our community guidelines
2954140	2955540	or terms of service.
2955540	2959600	These apply to all streamers regardless of status or prominence in the community.
2959600	2960600	I suppose.
2960600	2964120	I mean of course if their statement was found to lack sufficient merit then they could have
2964120	2967880	been in hot water, however I'm sure Twitch had considered that and probably assembled
2967880	2971320	a reason that they could defend themselves with in the scenario that the Doc took them
2971320	2972320	to court.
2972320	2976180	Nonetheless, even if they did find a few breaches of contract or guidelines to use against our
2976180	2979760	disrespectful friend, would they be completely in the clear?
2979760	2983120	While you're entering tricky territory, because if he was banned for a justified reason
2983120	2986360	then Twitch's statement on the matter wouldn't necessarily be false.
2986360	2990200	It also depends on their actual reasoning behind the ban, we're going to explore theories
2990200	2994200	very soon, but there are a variety of violations that the Doc could have been banned from Twitch
2994200	2998120	for, yet probably wouldn't have been too affected by in other parts of the community.
2998120	3002100	If they had been revealed, even if they were still fair reasons for Twitch's perspective,
3002100	3005100	he likely would have experienced less impact to his business.
3005100	3008640	In this case, you could feasibly prove that Twitch's failure to disclose any reason had
3008640	3013780	a worse impact than actually disclosing a reason, which included lesser breaches.
3013780	3015760	This is what this is all about.
3015760	3018400	This is the reason Joshua Holcomb was pulled over.
3018400	3024660	New Mexico statute 66-3-846, driving with an obstructed window.
3024660	3029640	This morning I did an informal survey of the courthouse parking lot, and by my count, over
3029640	3033920	a third of the vehicles had something similar hanging from their rear view mirrors.
3033920	3040120	So unless you and 47 of our colleagues have outstanding tickets, I'd argue that this
3040120	3042840	statute is not regularly enforced.
3042840	3046640	I know this isn't the most academic reference, but there's a brief scene in the new season
3046640	3050960	of Better Call Saul, where lawyer Kim Wexler illustrates how attentive law had been selectively
3050960	3054000	applied against one of her clients in a discriminatory fashion.
3054000	3059360	Kim Wexler- Your honor, this was a perfectly reasonable routine stop for cause.
3059360	3061200	This was not routine.
3061200	3062540	Officer Connell knew my client.
3062540	3066320	In fact, he arrested him five years ago, and Officer Connell's record shows that this
3066320	3070980	is only the third citation he's written for this statute in almost 20 years.
3070980	3076980	So either this is an incredible coincidence, or Officer Connell recognized my client and
3076980	3080020	used the dangler as a pretext to violate his fourth amendment rights.
3080020	3083920	So that even if it was technically correct, it's poor enforcement had indulged a culture
3083920	3085940	that normalized that behavior.
3085940	3089900	I think within reason you could easily make the same argument against Twitch.
3089900	3093740	In this case, doctors suspect may have felt he had pretty strong grounds to file a lawsuit,
3093740	3097420	and even if Twitch were happy with their reasoning behind the ban, they may have also been very
3097420	3101380	hesitant to roll the dice in court this time round, because although in previous cases
3101380	3104980	they have probably given viewers enough to go off when working out reasons for a ban,
3104980	3109140	even if not overtly stated, here it was all rather up in the air, particularly given their
3109140	3113820	inconsistent record on actually disciplining other creators, who similarly pushed the envelope.
3113820	3118900	Make no mistake, Dr Disrespect is not your ideal Twitch creator, he's not entirely unproblematic,
3118900	3122380	it wouldn't be particularly difficult to compile a file of all the numerous times he pushed
3122380	3126400	this stick a little too far for some people's liking, yet Twitch's continuous and even
3126400	3130840	renewed consent for his presence on the platform set a standard in his mind that he thought
3130840	3131840	was acceptable.
3131840	3135760	The moments where he was arguably at his most audacious was in many people's minds the
3135760	3137800	moments where he was most in character.
3137800	3142260	The possibility is that Twitch is failure to distinguish that and impose standards consistently
3142260	3147000	could have undermined the solidity of their own guidelines, but why would they do that
3147000	3149820	in the first place?
3149820	3153460	The greatest question that has pervaded this case is why.
3153460	3155360	Why was Dr Disrespect banned?
3155360	3159120	I think we're at a point where we may have to accept that we will never know for certain,
3159120	3162360	and that is the case with a lot of situations, if you're not there, it's hard to exactly
3162360	3163360	know what happened.
3163360	3166880	Nonetheless, it's one of those instances where there isn't really even a vague consensus
3166880	3171080	of what exactly inspired Twitch to take action, theories wildly range from the most severe
3171080	3175280	transgressions to minor and petty motivations that would surprise everyone.
3175280	3177880	Why can't we think of a proper reason and agree on it?
3177880	3181120	Well, I think there are a few factors at play that we can pin down.
3181120	3185200	The first is, and this one's quite obvious, consistency.
3185200	3189040	Twitch's failure to enforce rules consistently didn't just affect creators, but affected
3189040	3191480	an audience understanding of the Twitch rules as well.
3191480	3195080	Unless you're very accustomed with the platform, I'm sure that many people here wouldn't know
3195080	3199400	if some of Dr Disrespect's more irreverent behaviour was even in breach of the rules,
3199400	3203260	and even if we could, we could probably also think of times where people weren't punished
3203260	3207080	for the exact same transgression, if a large majority of creators wouldn't be punished
3207080	3211040	for it, why would a creator as universal as Dr Disrespect be?
3211040	3214200	Other than explaining that the doc was banned for a contravention of the guidelines, the
3214200	3218240	Twitch statement also subtly implies that said guidelines are consistent, whether this
3218240	3221240	was an attempt to try and set the standard that their rules have been applied fairly
3221240	3224760	to try and cover the fact that they were acutely aware that they weren't is not really for
3224760	3228700	me to say, but it's a curious detail that I think is worth observing.
3228700	3231920	We know that Twitch is not the most consistent, but something must have changed in the months
3231920	3235560	running up to the doc's ban that ultimately led to his removal from the platform.
3235560	3239300	Well, as mentioned earlier on in the video, there were some changing circumstances that
3239300	3242560	could have altered Twitch's stance on their creators, Twitch couldn't attribute the
3242560	3246360	changing environment alone to their decision in taking the two time off the platform, however
3246360	3250340	deep down, given everything going on, it felt like it must have played a role.
3250340	3253560	The ongoing discussion surrounding the industry's problem with the treatment of women had led
3253560	3257080	some to draw a connection between the two, but I think the even more significant development
3257080	3260400	was the retreat at Mixer and their aggressive tactics.
3260400	3263880	Now Mixer was never the greatest threat to the market, but the way they went about their
3263880	3268960	business certainly was, and the nature poached large creators if anything disrupted the ecosystem
3268960	3270120	in an unfavourable way.
3270120	3274200	I also think the presence of aggressive competition made Doctor Disrespect one of Twitch's most
3274200	3278440	valuable creators, because he commanded a loyal audience and a unique appeal that would
3278440	3282200	probably follow him to another platform, many of whom subsequently did.
3282200	3286480	Now ultimately, with what we know, he couldn't have been absolutely indispensable, and some
3286480	3290440	may point out the fact that when he left, he actually went to a more competitive platform
3290440	3294700	than Mixer, and I'd say that's a fair point, however his departure at a sensitive time
3294700	3298400	definitely could have swung momentum in a way that other creators failed to do so, a
3298440	3302720	narrative had formed that maybe this was the end of Twitch's market domination, and someone
3302720	3306120	like the Doc going to another platform could have easily fuelled that.
3306120	3310040	In hindsight, even if Mixer's statistics showed they never really posed that much of
3310040	3314560	a menace, their demise allowed Twitch to retain that symbolic stranglehold on the market,
3314560	3317200	allowing them to act with more confidence and ruthlessness.
3317200	3321100	It seems that regardless of the actual reason behind Doctor Disrespect's ban, it was more
3321100	3325340	a result of the evolving circumstances around Twitch, who either felt compelled to do something
3325340	3328860	in that specific moment, or felt like they finally had the freedom to.
3328860	3333220	There is a ton of speculation out there, and that's all it is right now, it's complete
3333220	3337080	and utter speculation, you know, it is the elephant in the room, we have to put it out
3337080	3342020	there, and we also have to say, we just don't know.
3342020	3345140	This meant that when reviewing the case, people didn't really have much of a pattern to
3345140	3348340	work with, they didn't have an established rulebook for Twitch, and they struggled to
3348340	3352940	decipher what about the Doc's behaviour was exceptional in the run up to his ban.
3353060	3354060	WAKE UP!
3358060	3362780	Yeah, sure, his final stream was weird, his behaviour erratic, and narrative rather curious,
3362780	3366480	but it's hard to really read too much into it, the most you could say is that it seems
3366480	3370380	like he found out something, and obviously didn't take it well, whether that information
3370380	3373700	was merely part of the Twitch situation, he wasn't prepared to talk about it, and in
3373700	3377980	this instance, we can't really do much about it, particularly given that it didn't really
3377980	3382620	lead to much directly, he wasn't arrested, he wasn't sued, he was just banned from
3382620	3385940	Twitch, and we still don't know for sure if the two are related, or if the guy was
3385940	3387660	just acting up a bit.
3387660	3391500	There is a further factor to consider when trying to deconstruct audience bemusement,
3391500	3394580	and that being journalism and coverage surrounding the matter.
3394580	3398660	Not too long after his ban, certain seemingly credible sources in the industry stated that
3398660	3402380	they'd been informed as to why the Doc had been banned, with many stating that the reason
3402380	3406660	was really bad, however, if the reason was as serious as they framed it, why would it
3406660	3410100	be left in the dark to the point where he is still essentially operating the way he
3410100	3411300	previously did?
3411300	3414660	Although these people seemed believable in their intent, it was hard to buy it without
3414660	3415660	any accompaniment.
3415660	3419180	And I'm not saying that I think these people were lying when they said they'd been informed
3419180	3423040	of the supposed reason, I think it's very feasible they were told something, but nobody
3423040	3426340	had the confidence in the reason they'd been told to actually say it.
3426340	3430140	Slash himself said he was afraid of a defamation lawsuit, and when it's not your information
3430140	3431900	I can understand that.
3431900	3435660	Nevertheless, defamation is only valid when the claim is false, and therefore it seems
3435660	3439220	that many were aware that there could be an error within this reason, or a lack of
3439220	3452940	supporting evidence to back up these claims if given proper scrutiny.
3452940	3476120	Eventually, many media sources seemed to retreat, saying, well, we're just as confused
3476120	3478360	as you are, and the lead went cold.
3478360	3482220	The focus on something more serious, particularly given the environmental circumstances at the
3482220	3486300	time, served to add to the broad church of theories regarding Dr Disrespect.
3486300	3489720	The final factor, of course, is the fact that neither Twitch nor Dr Disrespect ever even
3489720	3490940	alluded to the reason.
3490940	3494980	The closest we reached was the doc downplaying any in-stream behaviour, and being interrupted
3494980	3498940	by his publicist, but that was supposedly before he was aware of the reason himself.
3498940	3502660	The fact that nobody said a thing implied to viewers that there had to be a benefit
3502660	3506820	to not discussing it, and sure, the legal explanation is pretty comprehensive, and it's
3506820	3511540	possible that part of their as-a-court settlement was an agreement to not disclose this information,
3511540	3515380	and there's that lingering sentiment that surely someone would say something if it was
3515380	3520220	clear cut one way or the other, if it was so serious that the doc had to go, or if it
3520220	3523020	was so serious that the doc had to sue.
3523020	3527060	People have this insatiable desire to find out why, even when the answer isn't in front
3527060	3531380	of us, yet with all the factors considered, so many theories ran amok, and clouded any
3531380	3535900	attempt to really analyse each explanation on the basis of its merits, so why don't we
3535900	3536900	do that now?
3536900	3545380	There are a lot of theories, and obviously we can't cover every individual defining
3545380	3549540	detail that makes each hypothesis unique, however, most of these speculations do share
3549540	3554100	features, and we'll be focusing on the overarching narratives behind them, the arguments in favour,
3554100	3555500	and against their likelihood.
3555500	3559020	As with other parts, this is obviously not a definitive statement, and what actually
3559020	3562980	happened may be completely different to anything we discuss here today.
3563060	3567820	So with that in mind, let's start with the most unexceptional theories, that being Dr Disrespect
3567820	3572380	committed a simple breach of the rules, and Twitch decide to ban him on that basis.
3572380	3575300	How boring, but is it really that improbable?
3592980	3598780	I mean, Dr Disrespect had certainly received a bit of blowback for his statements surrounding
3598780	3602900	Covid, and it certainly indulged some interesting antics, including claiming he had purchased
3602900	3608620	Shungite to combat the alleged radiation from 5G, as advocated by some conspiracy theorists.
3609620	3614700	There's a bigger agenda happening, bigger agenda going on, man.
3614700	3620740	I'm with Elon, I'll just say it, I'm with Elon Musk, like, look at the data, just look
3620740	3625160	at it, man, and we are prolonging something, I gotta stop.
3625160	3628900	Now this can all be interpreted in good humour, but in a time where conspiracy theories were
3628900	3633040	receiving a lot of harsh criticism, particularly given the pandemic, it's completely plausible
3633040	3636720	that some at the top may have been rubbed the wrong way, hell, in his final stream he
3636720	3640520	promotes David Icke, who's mention certainly would have turned a few heads on its own.
3640520	3644400	Twitch had received a bit of flack from media sources for their inaction on conspiracy theories,
3644400	3646480	with Kotaku mentioning the dot by name.
3646480	3651360	It was clear there was a frustration in his behaviour, even if it was part of the character,
3651360	3655480	maybe Twitch decided that they had to take action to send a message to other creators.
3655480	3658560	However, was this even against the community guidelines?
3658560	3663040	Well nowadays it would be, however back in 2020, the community guidelines only covered
3663040	3667920	this on very vague terms, highlighting misinformation as a breach of the guidelines, however not
3667920	3672080	really saying too much about what that misinformation included, in fact the examples they provide
3672080	3675840	point towards misinformation in a different sense, more relating to how you present your
3675840	3680120	channel on the platform, though it does list feigning distress as an example, something
3680120	3683040	that the doc may have been accused of in his final stream.
3683040	3687320	At the same time, how would you prove something like that is feigned beyond a reasonable doubt?
3687320	3690000	Without a confession, there's really no way you could.
3690000	3691840	Would this have been enough to peg the doc?
3691840	3693720	It's possible, but far from definitive.
3693720	3697160	He was far from the only person discussing these theories, and surely if Twitch had merely
3697160	3700880	spoken to him and communicated that they weren't happy with some of his behaviour, he would
3700880	3702300	have changed it accordingly.
3702300	3706800	Many would argue that he committed worse transgressions on the platform and received lesser punishment,
3706800	3710240	and if they were looking to make an example of him, surely they would have emphasised
3710240	3712080	the reason why he was banned.
3712080	3716240	The owners of Twitch, Amazon, have a very sympathetic film on David Icke available on
3716240	3717240	their website.
3717240	3720340	It would seem a little hypocritical to say the least.
3720340	3724140	So although possible, this alone probably would have put them in a bit of a tight spot,
3724140	3727580	and they presumably didn't have too much to gain from it, especially as the spotlight
3727580	3731620	wasn't on the doc at the time, lest we be reminded that despite reaching a settlement
3731620	3735900	the Dr Dispect found satisfactory, it still didn't entail him returning to the platform
3735900	3738380	like he aimed, they did not want him back.
3738380	3741780	Surely a basic breach of the rules was not enough of a motivation on its own.
3741780	3745540	Twitch needed to be looking out for themselves when they took this action, and this is where
3745540	3746980	other theories can be introduced.
3746980	3755620	As noted, the banning of Dr Disrespect followed shortly after the collapse of the competing
3755620	3760180	streaming platform Mixer, many of our duty to Mixer's demise as a factor in the expulsion
3760180	3761180	of the doc.
3761180	3763620	But what if it wasn't just a factor, but the motive?
3763620	3781900	A variety of theories have been expounded on this one, the simpler one suggests that
3781900	3786060	Dr Disrespect had been expected to transfer to Mixer after a deal had been made behind
3786060	3789900	closed doors, and the discontinuation of Mixer had caused this information to be leaked to
3789900	3793820	Twitch executives, who saw this deal as a breach of the contract signed by the doc.
3793820	3797660	A more elaborate theory states that upon hearing about the dire straits faced by the Microsoft
3797660	3801700	owned platform, the prudent minded businessmen approached other large streamers on the website,
3801700	3805740	including Ninja, with the mind to start a new Spotify backstream platform by the name
3805740	3809180	of Brine, which suspiciously resembles Pride.
3809180	3812420	Somehow this made it back to Twitch, and once again they took action against our streamer
3812420	3813420	friend.
3813420	3816780	Another one advocated by some from the community suggests that the doc allegedly lied about
3816780	3820800	offers from Mixer to receive more money from Twitch during contract negotiations, and once
3820800	3823900	more when Mixer shut down, Twitch found out and took action.
3823900	3826380	Are there any merits to these sorts of theories?
3826380	3830180	Well it would certainly give Twitch a stronger motive to ban Dr Disrespect, after all his
3830180	3833920	presence on the platform could have been used as leverage to encourage other creators and
3833920	3837700	viewers to leave Twitch, although it's questionable whether this behaviour would have constituted
3837700	3842140	a breach of the rules, or even an exclusivity contract, they may have felt it more economically
3842140	3845540	viable to ban him as they saw his presence as a liability.
3845540	3849220	Dr Disrespect's ban reduces his mobility in the community at least, and may make it
3849220	3854000	harder for him to set up any sort of competing service, or go anywhere else, there is a long
3854000	3858900	term financial motive here, but is there anything else, or is it just people trying to find
3858900	3860620	a reason when there isn't one?
3860620	3865000	First of all, the Brine theory didn't really seem to take off, mainly because Spotify themselves
3865000	3869420	never seemed interested in launching that sort of service, and its source wasn't particularly
3869420	3870420	strong.
3870420	3874060	Brine as a streaming website did seem to have some credibility, they do have some social
3874060	3877820	pages, but it never really went anywhere, and it's hard to see why the Doc would be
3877820	3882000	related to that, especially as they kept uploading promotional material after he had allegedly
3882000	3883000	moved to YouTube.
3883000	3887140	Dr Disrespect going to Mixer at the end of its lifespan also seems pretty unlikely, the
3887140	3890540	Doc would already explain the problems with that sort of platform, and even if they had
3890540	3894460	approached him when facing its own closure, which seems unlikely in itself, surely there
3894460	3898260	was no way that the Doc would have been able to ignore the signs that this was a company
3898260	3900880	struggling, regardless of how much money they offered him.
3900880	3903920	Probably the most plausible theories out of these is the one where he doesn't actually
3903920	3909120	go anywhere, and he just utilises other supposed offers to haggle a good financial rate, but
3909120	3911280	once again, is that something the Doc would do?
3911280	3916240	It's very hard to say, he was probably being offered a monumental amount of money anyway,
3916240	3920000	was it his time to get greedy, and would Twitch have really been gullible enough to believe
3920000	3923280	a struggling company was offering big bucks?
3923280	3927080	But alright, maybe we don't know the platform he was considering, but maybe he was just
3927080	3929800	considering a move of sorts that annoyed Twitch.
3929840	3934040	Well, I suppose, but the dude seemed genuinely happy at the platform, and didn't seem like
3934040	3935520	he wanted to upset that.
3935520	3939800	I know you gotta put on a persona, but even if this explanation gave Twitch a motive,
3939800	3944840	it didn't really give Dr Disrespect one, why would he go to any other platform unless
3944840	3945800	he was forced?
3955800	3959480	We've spoken a lot about the reasons that Twitch may have to ban Dr Disrespect, and
3959480	3963440	many of them have and will harp on some sort of social motive, some sort of misconduct
3963440	3967280	that causes them to take action, however what if the motive was purely financial?
3967280	3968280	Is it possible?
3968280	3971840	Well as we know Mixer just shut down, and the Doc had been given a very sizable offer
3971840	3975640	to stay on the platform a few months prior, however with Mixer's closure, the newfound
3975640	3979920	availability of other large creators, and the decreased competitiveness of the market,
3979920	3984560	could Twitch release a few bags by cutting ties with one of their most expensive investments,
3984560	3988480	claiming he'd reached terms and conditions, and nullifying a pricey contract?
3988480	3991640	Some have suggested that Twitch couldn't afford creators like Shroud or Ninja if they
3991640	3995320	had retained the services of Dr Disrespect, however I don't think it would be the case
3995320	3999800	of couldn't in this scenario, it's more likely to be a case of wouldn't, but would
3999800	4000800	they?
4000800	4004480	On one hand this theory fits into the established timeline rather neatly, and would provide
4004480	4008800	a clear incentive for his removal, and the Doc's subsequent reaction and lawsuit, however
4008800	4012520	there are also uncertainties, with the litigation considered, was it really that profitable
4012520	4013520	a move for Twitch?
4013520	4017340	Would it really have been so troublesome to see out a contract and retain a high profile
4017340	4021020	figure who drew viewers, and why wouldn't they let him back on the platform despite
4021020	4022560	offering a payout?
4022560	4026160	Surely there had to be a greater motive than breaking an undesirable contract with a creator
4026160	4029380	whose longevity has outlasted many of his contemporaries?
4029380	4033500	Well let's entertain those now, as we know Twitch was having a bit of an image crisis
4033500	4036820	around this time, particularly with how they were presented in the media, and how some
4036820	4041000	of their industry executives have been caught behaving, I think the phrase toxic masculinity
4041000	4044920	might come to the lips of some when analysing the culture that have prevailed for a long
4044920	4048360	time, dotted disrespect had not been at the centre of the public conscience regarding
4048360	4052520	this controversy, and maybe he had no reason to be, but in many ways his behaviour did
4052520	4056400	offend the sensibilities of some around him, Twitch clearly wanted to pride themselves
4056400	4060480	on being a safer space for creators, and to distance themselves from the traditional image
4060480	4061700	of the toxic gamer.
4061700	4065320	We had this discussion earlier with Ninja, who left the platform and subsequently criticised
4065320	4069360	its toxicity, like himself, a lot of people who may have been associated with that image
4069360	4073280	had distanced themselves since, and even come to attack it, with large streams like Ninja
4073280	4077720	becoming available again from Mix's demise, was this the perfect time for Twitch to revamp
4077720	4078720	their own reputation?
4078720	4082880	I'm talking a lot, this chubby cheeks, 13 year old bratty attitude because his parents
4082880	4088680	never disciplined him type of mind frame, it's chatting it up in the chat, uh, I'd like
4088680	4091200	to see, where's your top 10?
4091200	4093520	You haven't even gotten a victory!
4093520	4098280	Ugly kid, let's go through your little specs here, outdated, outdated, everything about
4098280	4099800	your life is outdated.
4099840	4105240	No one's following your channel, it's horrible, your graphics, terrible, Jacob, your name,
4105240	4109260	misspelled your own name, you can't even spell your own name.
4109260	4110260	Get out of my face.
4110260	4114760	Dr Dispat was, in many senses, a trash talking villainess character who was all kitted out
4114760	4119080	to ruin some kid's day, and that was part of his appeal, but as we know, it made him
4119080	4123140	a very contentious character point, who probably made his fair share of enemies.
4123140	4127440	It's very possible that Twitch had some reservations regarding his behaviour, and even if he wasn't
4127440	4130840	directly breaching the guidelines, there was something immutable about his brand that
4130840	4134240	conflicted with the sort of platform that Twitch was aspiring to be, and the people
4134240	4135760	they were hoping to attract.
4135760	4139400	All it took was a couple of those enemies to have the right opportunity to pounce and
4139400	4143520	make a case for his removal from the platform, not for any specific reason, but because he
4143520	4148280	represented a bygone era for them, a generation of gamers that didn't create a welcoming environment
4148280	4150280	for those that Twitch wanted to appeal to.
4150280	4154520	The only reason he had been kept on was because Mix and other platforms had been placing pressure
4154520	4158120	on Twitch to retain him as a draw for viewing numbers, but once that pressure was gone,
4158120	4162640	they could finally take action in shaping the market the way they wanted to, and Dr Disrespect
4162640	4164760	was that vision's sacrificial lamb.
4164760	4166480	Is there anything to support this theory?
4166480	4170040	While it would certainly explain why Twitch were highly vague in their explanation, and
4170040	4174260	why Dr Disrespect believed in his case enough to initiate a lawsuit against the platform,
4174260	4177720	it would provide an underlying motive for the streaming platform's decision, one that
4177720	4181800	could to them have a long term benefit, while fitting in with the broadly held idea that
4181800	4185680	the doctor in the house hadn't committed any major malfeasances, or serious breaches
4185680	4186680	of a contract.
4186680	4189920	It would explain why Twitch didn't want him back on the platform, in spite of offering
4189920	4193560	a settlement that he felt was susceptible, implying that they perhaps had a bit of doubt
4193560	4195320	in the reasoning behind their case.
4195320	4199240	It would also clarify why they really couldn't confront him about it, or ask him to tune
4199240	4203120	it down, because it would be fundamentally opposed to who he is as a persona.
4203120	4207100	Still, that's a lot for Twitch to gamble on without any actual incident to instigate a
4207100	4211380	measure with a creator who was signed for a long term multi-million dollar deal.
4211380	4212900	Would it really be worth it?
4212900	4216560	Although Dr Disrespect was certainly a more controversial large creator than most, his
4216560	4220400	behaviour still didn't really approach the boundary of exceptional, and in a time where
4220400	4224640	all eyes were basically on anyone else but him, it would be a peculiar moment to begin
4224640	4229420	working on your image by banning someone who was seemingly unrelated to the present controversies.
4229420	4233300	With that said, there was always the possibility that Twitch banned Dr Disrespect to distract
4233300	4236640	from the controversies they were dealing with, but once again, surely there would be a less
4236640	4240380	costly way to deflect attention than banning one of your most popular creators.
4240380	4243700	I think the main problem with this theory is that it's one that is built around what
4243700	4247280	we don't know rather than what we do know, and although it could fit nicely in with some
4247280	4251800	of the black boxes of information, it can never really be the only option, particularly
4251800	4255360	when those black boxes are so broad that they yield multiple different theories.
4255360	4257240	What could be more substantial than this?
4257240	4262440	I can confirm with my sources that it is a permanent ban, and I can confirm that it is
4262440	4271260	not DMCA, but I do not have any information on what it is, other than it's pretty serious.
4271260	4274940	Well, I suppose there is one more theory, which is the elephant in the room, and that
4274940	4279160	is that obviously Dr Disrespect was alleged to have done something so serious that Twitch
4279160	4282860	could no longer ignore it, and had to take action against it, or else they could have
4282860	4284820	faced serious repercussions themselves.
4284820	4286740	Do we know what Dr Disrespect would have done?
4286740	4291540	No, and honestly, when it comes to more serious matters, I feel uneasy even speculating, but
4291540	4295440	we know that some who claim to know thought it was too serious to even mention, so there
4295440	4298180	must have been some possible legal implications.
4298180	4299680	What does this story say then?
4299680	4303400	Well, Twitch uncovered something, or informed us something, they couldn't take it public
4303400	4306960	because of those exact reasons themselves, and they didn't want to put themselves in
4306960	4311240	the firing line or jeopardise a possible investigation, however, with the knowledge they had, they
4311240	4314600	needed to take action so that person wasn't present on their platform.
4314600	4319140	Assumedly, in their mind, this person posed a present threat to other users on the platform,
4319140	4322860	maybe the medium he was operating over was through these networks, and Twitch believed
4322860	4325280	it to be their duty to cut those networks off.
4325280	4328540	Additionally, with the recent criticism that they've been receiving of an action where
4328540	4332740	severe misconduct was present, it would have reflected very poorly on them if information
4332740	4336740	was released that showed they were aware of the wrongdoings taking place, and had subsequently
4336740	4337740	done nothing.
4337740	4341720	I'll add that this doesn't mean Dr Disrespect has done anything criminal, maybe he was completely
4341720	4345200	innocent of whatever he'd been accused of, but given the external pressure and tense
4345200	4348820	environment, Twitch felt compelled to act, as reluctant as they were to ban one of their
4348820	4353140	largest most recognisable names, maybe the risk of doing nothing was just too great for
4353140	4356180	them to roll the dice with, there was really no other option for them.
4356180	4357700	What can be said in this story's favour?
4357700	4361360	Well, I suppose the first thing to note was obviously the claim that some names in the
4361360	4365060	industry corroborated this theory, and made public statements that seemed to imply that
4365060	4366540	something serious had occurred.
4366540	4370900	It provides a rationale behind Twitch's behaviour and both parties' reluctance to speak about
4370900	4375500	the actual reason, as whether true or false could affect either credibility or culpability.
4375500	4378620	It would explain some of the brand reactions if they'd been informed of the reason for
4378620	4382980	his ban, and would explain why he has struggled to obtain contracts for any other large platform
4382980	4384060	as far as we know.
4384060	4387900	That sort of information may be considered privileged, and it may explain why we don't
4387900	4391940	know, but surely if this was the case, we would have heard something, or at least we
4391940	4393380	should have heard something.
4393380	4396700	Twitch didn't just unpartner Dr Disrespect, they deplatformed him.
4396700	4401040	A few days before Dr Disrespect launched on YouTube, Slash reported that although YouTube
4401040	4404740	would not stop the doc from streaming on his platform, they wouldn't be signing any deals
4404740	4407300	with him, as if that was some sort of point against him.
4407300	4412620	I have seen no evidence, I have investigated fully, there's a possibility of him going
4412620	4418740	to another platform, okay, YouTube is out, they have not been in any discussions with
4418740	4419740	Dr Disrespect.
4419740	4427740	We started 11 years ago here on YouTube, and boy oh boy oh boy does it feel good to be
4427740	4428740	back.
4428740	4432020	The dude has still done well for himself in spite of YouTube's occasionally sub-passed
4432020	4433020	streaming system.
4433020	4435560	He has a fully monetised channel with 4 million subscribers.
4435560	4438720	Some would look at this and conclude that what he did couldn't have been that heinous
4438720	4442400	because he still had the opportunity to succeed elsewhere in the industry.
4442400	4445960	Many would also note that Disrespect took Twitch to court over this, and although criminals
4445960	4449980	have certainly made bolder moves, for someone whose public reputation is so integral to
4449980	4453960	his work, it would be surprising for him to put that at stake on a court case, which could
4453960	4456760	have exposed him when he could have just as easily moved on.
4456760	4461120	It seems this theory of serious malfeasance seemed the most plausible at first, but as
4461120	4465720	time passed it began to appear a little doubtful, though it's fair to say, not impossible.
4465720	4470280	However, not impossible isn't really the level of certainty we want to operate on,
4470280	4473560	but I ask you now, do we have any other option?
4473560	4483280	As I said earlier, the truth may be completely unrelated to all the theories we've discussed
4483280	4484280	today.
4484280	4487120	There are many variables in a case like this that it's too hard to account for every
4487120	4491840	single one, but judging previous cases, general human behaviour, and the nature of many of
4491840	4495480	these large corporations, these hypotheses seem to be the most popular.
4495480	4500280	Each one has their individual merit and logic behind it, yet there's a negative relationship
4500280	4502240	within each of the theories.
4502240	4506460	That being, the theories that give more reason behind Twitch's behaviour give less reason
4506460	4508500	behind Dr Disrespect's behaviour.
4508500	4512000	The alternative streaming platform theory is probably the most believable in regards
4512000	4516320	to how Twitch would act, but it seems really out of character for Dr Disrespect to do anything
4516320	4517320	like that.
4517320	4521600	Although we do have clear evidence of Dr Disrespect leaning into conspiracy theories, there's
4521600	4526240	no real evidence of Twitch ever taking action against it in the past, and no reason to not
4526240	4528880	just approach him and tell him to cut it out.
4528880	4532440	Over time, I think many have tended towards those theories that are more sympathetic to
4532440	4536780	the Doc, not just because of the actual evolving facts surrounding the case, but because they
4536780	4539860	want to believe that the guy genuinely didn't do anything wrong.
4539860	4543600	They saw someone who had been singled out by a platform for a reason that they never
4543600	4557600	explained and suffered consequences for being himself, and it's understandable to be honest,
4557600	4561840	because one of the more thought-provoking questions I'd say is who or how Twitch actually
4561840	4563200	helped by doing this.
4563200	4566400	Obviously, on the surface, Twitch didn't really help themselves, they lost a creative
4566400	4570920	brought in revenue and viewers, and was subjected to a lawsuit, certainly didn't help Dr Disrespect
4570920	4574900	who felt so aggrieved he initiated the lawsuit in the first place, and although it did lead
4574900	4578800	to some hijinks, I don't really think fans found the drama particularly gratifying.
4578800	4583360	If Twitch's aim was to protect any particular party, they haven't really done much either,
4583360	4587140	sure they've covered their own asses, but the dude just went to another platform and
4587140	4591280	still possesses enough power to hold tournaments and attend events, even if the opportunities
4591280	4592520	aren't quite as vast.
4592520	4597220	If it ever did come out that Dr Disrespect had been behaving, dare I say it, less than
4597220	4600880	respectfully, would Twitch be completely in the clear for how they handled it?
4600880	4604160	I have a hunch that they wouldn't be, early on there were some viewers who believed this
4604160	4609480	was all a large ruse for a new era of Dr Disrespect, I don't think many people are of that school
4609480	4614680	of thought anymore, but sometimes it just seems like the only remotely plausible explanation
4614680	4618880	because it's just so hard to make sense of it otherwise, it's hard to find an explanation
4618880	4622000	that rationalises the behaviour of everyone involved.
4622000	4625920	I often find myself returning to the question of Twitch's image, as that's the only
4625920	4627460	real motive that I can find.
4627460	4632380	By running such a secretive and often partisan system, Twitch set no real standard of conduct,
4632380	4636100	the only thing that often seemed consistent was the fact that larger creators did receive
4636100	4639820	better treatment than small creators, but the disappearance of Dr Disrespect seemed
4639820	4643740	to spit in the face of that belief, leading many to conclude that it must have been truly
4643740	4648380	exceptional behaviour, but maybe Twitch saw an opportunity in image revamp, under pressure
4648380	4652220	from a variety of media sources who all seemed to have the same grievance with him, this
4652220	4656380	was their statement to say that they weren't complete pushovers, but would it have really
4656380	4657380	worked?
4657420	4659140	Well, I don't think so.
4659140	4662780	Twitch still finds itself in and out of the spotlight for the decisions they take, they're
4662780	4666300	still accused of employing double standards for their preferred creators, and it's hard
4666300	4669980	to make the case that the atmosphere on the platform has changed since the Doc's departure.
4669980	4674100	It's really hard to say if the Doc was an influence on that in the first place, or if
4674100	4675860	he was just running his own show.
4675860	4679900	Twitch is so large at this point that a creator leaving doesn't seem to exert great cultural
4679900	4684460	influence, sure, he's popular, well known, influential, and he still is, but he's never
4684460	4688660	been a singular spokesperson for the gaming community, Dr Disrespect's popularity was
4688660	4693740	just a reflection of gaming culture, rather than being some industry-wide puppeteer, and
4693740	4697020	there have been many more serious examples of toxic behaviour on the platform in the
4697020	4701780	last couple of years, not to mention Dr Disrespect's own more serious antics that were often given
4701780	4703900	the soft touch by the Twitch moderation team.
4703900	4721540	Some could say his expulsion was in a way designed to prevent the accusations of double
4721540	4725420	standards when they took more serious action against toxicity, but it's not like those
4725420	4730020	accusations ever seemed to concern them in the past, the truth is Twitch really haven't
4730020	4733660	done that much, they've rewritten their terms and conditions a few times, tried to stay
4733660	4737180	on the pulse with popular opinion and what social media is saying, but that's not
4737180	4738180	new.
4738180	4741900	All of these platforms are works in progress that adapt themselves to the zeitgeist, Twitch
4741900	4746340	didn't seem to undergo any radical reforms as a consequence of them banning Dr Disrespect,
4746340	4749720	and you'd think if they saw creators with his attitude as that much of a threat then
4749720	4750720	they would have.
4750720	4754900	As a large corporate conglomerate with business interests at heart, people struggle to rationalise
4754900	4759580	Twitch's behaviour, which is why many end up siding with Dr Disrespect, but how are
4759580	4788740	we even to know that this was a corporate decision?
4788740	4809360	There's been some discourse about how Twitch handle their bans, and I think one thing to
4809360	4813820	note is that it's often a very select few who actually hand down and enforce those bans,
4813820	4818400	and it's an extremely secretive process, who is to stop it from getting personal?
4818400	4822160	We know Dr Disrespect is a little more than just a character, he could have easily pissed
4822160	4826080	someone powerful at Twitch off with them coming to the conclusion that they just didn't want
4826080	4829440	him around, maybe he didn't do anything criminal, maybe he didn't even breach the
4829440	4833720	guidelines in that time, he just did or said something behind the scenes that made an individual
4833720	4837800	or fellow streamer feel compelled to take action against him, maybe out of spite or
4837800	4840040	maybe to save their own skin.
4840040	4843440	Perhaps a personal matter overlapped into business, if it was a private matter then
4843440	4847520	who knows where or when it happened, or anything that could be revealed that may bring certain
4847520	4851540	figures into disrepute, we often see Twitch as an entity, and the decisions they make
4851540	4855360	as collective, but the truth is, a company is still made up of a lot of people with their
4855360	4859680	own motivations, choices are seldom taken without personal bias, and even if there were
4859680	4863760	some forms of corporate justification, it's completely valid to suggest that this was
4863760	4867500	instigated on a personal whim, even if it wasn't presented as such.
4867500	4871840	This just extends the realm of possible theories to nearly intangible levels, and leaves us
4871840	4873960	right back where we started.
4873960	4878040	You may believe the best in Dr Disrespect because they see Dr Disrespect as the human
4878040	4881760	he is, and although Twitch really didn't do the best to differentiate themselves from
4881760	4885960	robots with their public statements, they're still a company full of humans too, they're
4885960	4889860	just people whose decisions may only ever be known to themselves, providing us very
4889860	4894480	little evidence to work with, and when looking for explanations we latch onto what we have,
4894480	4899520	but as said, maybe the key here is what we haven't, and perhaps there's not much we
4899520	4900520	can do about that.
4903960	4914440	Many internet dwellers have this inherent desire to find out the truth of a situation,
4914440	4918040	and in a way it's understandable, when we have the truth we can make a more balanced
4918040	4922200	judgement, however with 99% of disputes we have to accept that we will never have the
4922200	4925560	full picture to pass judgement without any reservation at all.
4925560	4929400	With that said, with this case we have a lot less than that, and it makes it even harder
4929400	4931640	for anyone to arbitrate with clarity.
4931640	4935460	Nonetheless, people still like to have strong opinions, and in the time following his ban
4935460	4939120	and looking at the record of Twitch and The Doc respectively, people decided that whatever
4939120	4943040	the truth, that Dr Disrespect had probably been done dirty, and deserved better from
4943040	4948040	a platform he had enthusiastically hosted his content on and supported behind the scenes
4948040	4949040	for years.
4949040	4954320	This is a guy who was involved in the Justin.tv years, much longer than most of Twitch's
4954320	4966000	biggest names right now.
4966000	4970240	Now we must accept that there are circumstances where loyalty would not be enough to exonerate
4970240	4973920	one's actions, but since we have no idea what these actions are, and only rumours to
4973920	4977840	base our suspicions off, it's fair that many erred on Dr Disrespect's side.
4977840	4981360	I think people looked at the rumours of the more serious acts that are alleged to have
4981360	4985200	occurred, and thought, if nobody's willing to put it out there, then they can't be
4985200	4986200	that confident in it.
4986200	4990200	There are of course other reasons why something may not be public, and no stranger to this,
4990200	4993840	a lot of companies were much more anxious about the fact that nothing had been said.
4993840	4997320	They likely believed that reputational damage could be inflicted if they partnered with
4997320	5000760	a person who was soon revealed to be acting outside the realm of acceptability.
5000760	5005640	For a while, not even Dr Disrespect appeared to know what happened, I'm sure he was probably
5005640	5010040	more well informed than anyone else, but it's not like he could publicly theorise either,
5010040	5013320	as that would make him liable if he believed he had grounds to take legal action.
5013320	5017080	So he wasn't going to say anything, and when he did it was non-committal or dismissive
5017080	5021040	of certain theories, such as the one that revolved around the final stream.
5021040	5024440	Eventually legal action was initiated, and we thought that, once resolved, the one factor
5024440	5028280	that may have been causing the secrecy would be relieved, and we'd finally find out the
5028280	5031800	truth, especially if the Doc secured his return to Twitch.
5031800	5035960	However, it seemed as part of that settlement, neither party was going to be discussing the
5035960	5039860	matter any further, both releasing highly impersonal statements that could barely be
5039860	5041580	distinguished between each other.
5041580	5044800	Even the agreement itself was hard to read into, as it's difficult to say how much
5044800	5048720	money was offered, and how that reflected in the strength of the case against Twitch.
5048720	5052560	All we know is that the Doc was confident enough to file a lawsuit against the company,
5052560	5056160	but also happy enough to settle, there are a lot of ways to interpret that which depend
5056160	5058000	on details that we don't know.
5058000	5062720	Listen, I just point out the obvious, plus, you know, once I got banned from the Purple
5062720	5066640	Snakes platform, they like, secretly shadow banned and stopped talking to us, and all
5066640	5071040	that stuff, and to me, like, I took it personal, like, what the fuck, dude, we made multiple
5071040	5075280	commercials, we did lots of deals, and to exclude us from anything, and to not allow,
5075280	5080040	like, trust me, you know, design half the maps for Advanced Warfare, like, we've done
5080040	5084680	a lot with the franchise, right, and for them to turn the cold shoulder like that?
5084680	5086420	Trust me, I took it personal.
5086420	5090200	It's clear that the consequences of the Twitch ban are still in place, and Dr Disrespect
5090200	5093220	even vents his frustration from time to time on the matter.
5093220	5096680	Recently he hosted a Zero Bill tournament on Fortnite, with some popular Twitch streamers
5096680	5097680	also competing.
5097680	5101220	Boom TV, the host of the event, released a statement to competitors explaining that it
5101220	5105380	was prohibited for them to knowingly feature the suspended gentleman in question, and providing
5105380	5109620	suggestions and alternatives to avoid experiencing any negative repercussions for interacting
5109620	5110620	with him.
5110620	5115160	Hard to say if Doc saw the funny side to this, though he did manage a little Twitter chuckle.
5115160	5119560	We understand that there may be instances where suspended users may appear on your stream
5119560	5124480	due to circumstances beyond your control, such as through third party gaming tournaments,
5124480	5129120	but we expect that you make a good faith effort to remove them from your broadcast, mute them,
5129120	5132280	or otherwise limit their interactions with your stream.
5132280	5135720	Who knows whether the truth will ever come out, and maybe at some point in the future
5135720	5139640	some will decide they have very little to lose by speaking openly about it, but for
5139640	5141400	the moment it remains a mystery.
5141400	5145280	I'm sure some will wonder why, if the facts were in Dr Disrespect's favour as much as
5145280	5147400	they were, he wouldn't just speak up.
5147400	5151320	Regardless of the consequences, surely it's better to illustrate how ludicrous Twitch
5151320	5153600	were in banning him, right?
5153600	5157420	Well I think the greatest concern for a creator and businessman like Dr Disrespect would be
5157420	5161640	to have his career defined by the ban, and in a way it was a challenge to avoid it.
5161640	5165440	It was such a seismic shift in the community that very few could miss it, there's little
5165440	5169000	doubt that the uncertainty has prolonged people's discourse surrounding it, making us wonder
5169000	5172360	if it had been over sooner if the doc had just built the beans and allowed people to
5172360	5173360	make their own judgement.
5173360	5177000	However, there's no guarantee that any explanation would have provided closure, and if it was
5177000	5180760	contentious enough, could have very easily instigated more conflict if someone wanted
5180760	5181800	to dispute it.
5181800	5185640	In this case, it may very well be that the less anyone said the better, the financial
5185640	5189800	setback of being banned from Twitch is great, but the setback of having your career overshadowed
5189800	5193760	by conflict, whether you're in the right or not, is so much greater.
5193760	5196960	If the guy had lost everything already, then maybe he would have been a bit more tenacious
5196960	5202120	in court, but he's still out of channel, a fanbase, a company, partnerships, and a
5202120	5205600	variety of other outlets that were worth no less of his time.
5205600	5209720	It's understandable that some people to this day still want to know what exactly happened,
5209720	5213680	but the truth is, we're just not entitled to it, and there's no guarantee that knowing
5213680	5216800	would enhance our lives or our judgement in any way at all.
5216800	5220660	There's nothing wrong with theorising, but sometimes we just have to settle with theories
5220660	5224680	inside who we want to support in a situation, I think that's what Dr Disrespect would
5224680	5225680	prefer at least.
5225680	5229860	He knew he had to address it, but his tone in the interviews always showed a bit of disdain
5229860	5233080	for the theories that people were advocating, and even hinting at.
5233080	5236280	The general impression I receive from him is that he's the sort of guy who believes
5236280	5240200	that he will rebuild everything if he has to, with or without Twitch, and he'd much
5240200	5241640	rather talk about that.
5241640	5244960	He spent long enough in the industry to know how to survive, whether he'll truly ever
5244960	5248920	have the last laugh is something that's yet to be revealed, but for now it seems that
5248920	5251280	everyone got what they wanted.
5251280	5255200	As a company, Twitch has continued to dominate in their domain, YouTube and Facebook Gaming
5255200	5258520	have both retained their presence, but they can't come close to the control that Twitch
5258520	5259520	exerts on the market.
5259520	5263080	Don't get me wrong, they're still on their bullshit, but creators are still going to
5263080	5266520	stream, and viewers are still going to tune in, because there's no platform that can
5266520	5269540	provide you with the streaming dream like Twitch does.
5269540	5273560	You can't blame people for wanting to take advantage of that, but as Dr Disrespect found
5273560	5276280	out, sometimes you have to modify your dreams a little.
5277280	5285280	Millions of minutes watched is the number one metric, and it's right here on Twitch.
5285280	5289280	It's a shame that the Dr Disrespect Twitch era ever had to come to an end, but whether
5289280	5293680	there was a good reason or not, there's always an opportunity for a new era to begin.
5306280	5318400	I'm excited, extremely excited that a team at Midnight Society absolutely busted their
5318400	5322260	asses off, and we're here to change the game.
5322260	5325720	Twitch and Dr Disrespect had a very prosperous business relationship.
5325720	5329520	In many ways, it was one that seemed mutually beneficial and deeply rooted for the large
5329520	5331440	proportion of its existence.
5331440	5335160	Twitch as a platform trying to cement its status in the gaming scene, and the Doc as
5335160	5340000	an ambitious and outspoken persona looking for a medium that supported his antics.
5340000	5344140	Over the years, Dr Disrespect drew his channel, but also his brand, becoming an identifiable
5344140	5349160	figure for those inside and outside the community, garnering a media presence like few other
5349160	5350160	creators.
5350160	5353920	Twitch obviously provided the platform, but Dr Disrespect did provide a standout persona
5353920	5358400	in a sea of creators whose appeal was often based on other aspects of their content.
5358400	5362320	That's not a discredit to them, but it's definitely a credit to the Doc, whose longevity
5362320	5365400	on an ever-evolving platform seemed nearly guaranteed.
5365400	5370000	When the competition picked up, and certain creators migrated to other platforms, our
5370000	5373920	titular character only strengthened his relationship with the website that had fostered his growth
5373920	5378240	over the years, pledging his allegiance in the most binding way possible with a life-changing
5378240	5381200	contract that likely produced eye-watering sums of money.
5381200	5385880	In spite of his illustrious career up to this point, this was still a significant step forward,
5385880	5390200	everything seemed to be going right, which was the perfect time for something to go wrong.
5390200	5393720	As we've seen, there are a plethora of theories for what exactly happened, but the underlying
5393720	5397680	theme of it was that Twitch likely made the judgement that that mutual benefit of their
5397680	5401520	relationship had run its course, and the Doc had become a liability.
5401520	5405360	Whether that was due to divergence in common goals, or a specific incident that left Twitch
5405360	5409880	feeling like they had to take action is hard to entirely know, but the impact was long
5409880	5410880	felt.
5410880	5437200	That was the thing, regardless of who you sided with, or your own personal suspicions,
5437200	5440520	there was always cause for concern, whether you felt that it was a stark reminder that
5440520	5444540	Twitch could take a person's platform away without even blinking twice, or whether you
5444540	5448640	felt it represented concern for how creator may have behaved, not being shielded from
5448640	5451080	people who may be affected by their behaviour.
5451080	5455440	This had a ripple effect on audiences, platforms, and even other businesses who were previously
5455440	5460040	affiliated with the Doc, collaterally influencing not only his direct income in the moment,
5460040	5463720	but also his mobility in the community, and all the perks that he'd previously derived
5463720	5465080	from being a streamer.
5465080	5468640	It put Dr Disrespect in a position where he could suck it up and move on, or try to
5468640	5485880	fight for his place once more.
5485880	5489720	In a way, he seemed to try and exploit both options, spending the first year or so rebuilding
5489720	5493840	his online presence on a new platform, expanding his business avenues, and even establishing
5493840	5494840	his own company.
5494840	5498480	At that time, he was often quite cryptic, not really giving much during interviews,
5498480	5502520	when the time was right he'd launch his lawsuit, likely playing to the visible financial
5502520	5505680	damage that could be observed in the year following his banishment.
5505680	5509480	We theorise on what the terms of the lawsuit could have been, but we know it probably emphasised
5509480	5510680	what he had lost.
5510680	5514480	Ultimately, in Dr Disrespect's ideal world, he would have made his triumph from return
5514480	5517760	to Twitch, with them admitting they had made a dire mistake.
5517760	5521760	However, although it was clear that the streaming platform was prepared to offer a compromise,
5521760	5525320	it was not one that necessarily included his Twitch channel.
5525320	5530020	Advised by legal experts with probably more experience than you and I, he took that compromise,
5530020	5534000	which also entailed saying as little as possible about it, and though sometimes it feels like
5534000	5537200	the Doc wants to say more than he should, he's professional enough to hold his tongue
5537200	5539560	and continue on the trajectory he's set for himself.
5539560	5543200	It's not easy to lose something that you've spent years building, and to feel like you're
5543200	5546800	going back to the start in a way is probably one of the most demoralising things that can
5546800	5547800	happen.
5547840	5552640	The platform, what is just another channel, is a person's lifetime work all in one space,
5552640	5556520	it's hard not to be bitter about that, and honestly, I don't think anyone would have
5556520	5561120	blamed him for throwing in the towel, but Dr Disrespect is no quitter, and in many ways
5561120	5563680	he turned a negative into something positive.
5563680	5567320	Dr Disrespect- We're gonna make a game with our pros, and we're gonna make a game with
5567320	5571400	you, our community, and we think that's a different way of making a video game than
5571400	5576000	anyone's ever made one before, and even though making games is really really hard,
5576000	5580040	and really really challenging, we think by doing it this way, we have a really good chance
5580040	5581040	of succeeding.
5581040	5584400	In the past few months there has definitely been an interest towards creator-run gaming
5584400	5591440	studios, 100 Thieves, OTK, and of course Midnight Society, headed by Dr Disrespect himself and
5591440	5594120	using his namesake as a significant selling point.
5594120	5598580	The pivot towards creator controlled games could really influence how the industry operates,
5598580	5602240	the Doc is at the forefront of that, and although there has been the occasional criticism for
5602240	5605960	how the studio has been operated, there's still a lot of hope and anticipation for the
5605960	5610920	output of more consumer-oriented games, however the gaming studio does represent more than
5610920	5614880	that, because it amplifies the Doc's reach and gives him more of a standing in a community
5614880	5627200	that he had struggled in due to his lost connections with Twitch, in a way the more conspiratorial
5627200	5632120	side of me sees these enterprises as Dr Disrespect's attempt to be so omnipresent that Twitch
5632120	5636080	will eventually have no other option but to acknowledge him, all these people on their
5636080	5640800	platform playing a game by a person they've banned, attending his tournaments, he can't
5640800	5645240	be shunned from the industry when he is the industry, wouldn't that be the sweetest
5645240	5646240	revenge?
5646240	5650300	I don't know, and I don't know if Twitch cares about it that much, but going forward
5650300	5654680	one can't help but wonder if their paths will cross once more, and how exactly it will
5654680	5655680	be navigated.
5655680	5662040	All I can say is that both Twitch and Dr Disrespect seem determined to get their share, how success
5662040	5664760	all they are is a story only time will tell.
5664760	5668760	It's fair to say that the mystery of Dr Disrespect's disappearance from Twitch may
5668760	5673640	never be solved, a man at the peak of his popularity having the rug pulled from under
5673640	5679560	him so unexpectedly, an abundance of theories that never quite unscrambled the enigma, and
5679560	5683760	a court case that only mystified the facts, but within that mystery there was a nugget
5683760	5688800	of truth, that whatever the setback, even one where you lose your whole damn channel,
5689040	5693840	it's never completely over, and for many, Dr Disrespect is still just getting started.
5693840	5700240	Let's climb the mountain, let's dominate, violence, speed, and momentum, and guess what?
5700240	5707400	We're at the tip of the top of the mountain, but we're really, but we're really only halfway
5707400	5708400	up.
5708400	5710320	Let's do it baby!
5718800	5729400	Ok, so that was the video, I hope you all enjoyed it, I know I did, I'd like to give

5797300	5803900	day and I hopefully will see you in the next one, no no no we need more certainty, we need
5803900	5807420	more conviction, I'm The Right Opinion and I will see you in the next one.
