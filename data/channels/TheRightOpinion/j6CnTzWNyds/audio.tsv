0	18760	Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time, and a legacy,
18760	24040	something that I'm sure many of us have pondered. The age-old question beckons, when we all move on from this world,
24040	28600	what will we leave behind? The truth is, none of us can ever know for certain, because the moment we pass on,
28600	32800	we relinquish most control of the narrative surrounding how we're remembered. People who have been considered
32800	37800	controversial and problematic have been recontextualised by their death, and sometimes, figures previously revered
37800	43000	have had their involvement in some very seedy antics revealed post-mortem. In some cases, a perspective will take
43000	48200	centuries to form, in other times it will take merely days. However, one thing that remains central in analysis of
48200	54440	individuals is the existence of art. I use the term art liberally, of course, here. I'm not just talking about a painting
54480	59480	or a sculpture, I'm talking about the general product of any form of creative process that can affect someone's life in a
59480	65040	meaningful way. An artist's direct words or thoughts may be long forgotten, but their creations will always serve as a window
65040	70360	to their mind. What these works may say specifically is often down to interpretation, but there are often general themes
70360	75840	that many people identify with, which is what provides them with a following and a reputation. Upon analysis of such
75840	80960	content, many of us draw parallels between the pieces and the person behind them. After all, art should be a part of
80960	86400	oneself, we enjoy identifying with others, even when it extends to maestros who we could never really hope to get near in
86400	92240	terms of genius. For the new generation of aspiring creatives, times have somewhat evolved, particularly with the presence
92240	97400	of social media, which enables many people to speak more directly to their chosen audience. For those who choose to use
97400	102520	it, you may have a close-up on the person behind a beloved work, and based on their behaviour, you may be able to make a
102520	107880	summary judgement if you want to delve into their works much further. However, with all the benefits that such an experience
107880	113400	can provide, it can also play into unhealthy parasocial relationships, one that we've spoken about in the past,
113400	119400	particularly when said art may not appear to reflect a person's character. Yes, every now and then, anomalies appear on the
119400	124400	system, people who may have created something wonderful that many find to be an uplifting and positive force in their life
124400	130400	may also have negatively affected others in a marked way, either due to their actions or words separate to their art.
130400	136120	This is where the discourse surrounding distinguishing art form from the artist originates. Appreciating good workmanship
136160	142160	doesn't necessarily presuppose a complete endorsement of the person behind it. However, over time, the bar for this sort of
142160	147560	standard has definitely been lowered a little. With the rise of social media, and people perhaps having a bit too much time to
147560	153720	argue, this sort of distinction has become more and more regularly employed. A prime example of such a trend is JK Rowling,
153720	158920	a previously renowned celebrity who took a political position that was contrary to many of her colleagues and fans.
158920	164280	If she'd never sent out a tweet on the matter, many people who probably regard her with disdain would still adore her.
164600	170920	Humans are complex, multi-faster creatures, many of whom are deeply troubled and don't necessarily benefit from the public spotlight,
170920	175880	sometimes leaving us to wonder whether we knew them as well as we thought we did, and perhaps wishing we didn't know them
175880	182360	quite as well now. This is what leads us to probably the most quintessentially Gen-Z example, a gentleman by the name of Marcus
182360	185400	Persson, or as he is known to many online, Notch.
185960	205080	Notch is a Swedish game developer, who in 2009 began a humble little project known as Minecraft. I feel like I shouldn't have to
205080	210360	elaborate too much here, but Minecraft is a sandbox video game which enables the user to build a multitude of structures
210360	216680	and face off against a variety of monsters who descend upon the player at dusk. It has four modes, creative, survival,
216680	223160	hardcore, and adventure, each with its own type of gamer, allowing for a very broad appeal indeed. Over the last decade
223160	229720	and a bit, it has amassed cross-platform sales in excess of $230 million, making it the best-selling video game of all time
229720	235800	by a significant margin. It has also received numerous awards, franchised itself to a dizzying extent, and established itself
235800	241720	as a cultural force to be reckoned with, its timeless appeal being typified by its continued creation of public figures
241720	248040	who are likely just as publicly visible as the man behind the game. But in a way, I suppose it makes sense, many individual
248040	253160	developers are barely a fraction as well known as the games they create, they're most comfortable making the magic happen
253160	259560	behind the scenes, and in the case of many games, it's hardly a singular effort, and very few people end up being standout
259560	265320	figures. Audiences can't expect to learn the entire roster of a video game studio. Notch was different though, as the
265320	270680	big head behind Minecraft, he set himself apart from faceless corporations and created a unique bond with his audience,
270680	276200	utilising the game's network and accompanying social media platforms to create this almost legendary figure in gaming
276200	282120	circles, who would interact and respond to feedback from many of the devoted audience. To many, Minecraft and Notch
282120	285560	were inseparable. Well, until they weren't.
285960	288520	Maybe, I don't know, were you the Minecraft guy? No.
291160	297000	Cut to 2022 though, and trying to find any remnants of even the word Notch on Minecraft's servers would be a challenge
297000	305000	to even the most ardent user. Person unsurprisingly had cashed out his shares in 2014, making a tidy 1.7 billion dollars,
305000	309880	and adopting a lifestyle that supported that. In many ways, he had done what many creatives wished they could do,
309880	315480	walk away with a shithole of money, and have your legacy commemorated and honoured by many users and creators.
315720	321160	However, barely a couple of years after he'd become a billionaire, Notch began to publicly head down a curious path,
321160	325800	one that gradually became more and more questionable to those who looked on, and eventually resulted in Microsoft,
325800	331320	the company who had bought out Minecraft, to cuddle public ties with him in the hopes that a PR nightmare would be averted.
331320	337080	It seems that in spite of his undeniable contribution to modern culture, certain people believe he would be better off
337080	343320	forgotten altogether. Well, today we're going to be paying him a bit of time, taking a look at the man behind Minecraft,
343320	349560	the mind that married the creation, the eventual and painful divorce, and what legacy may be left behind.
350200	354600	Ladies, gentlemen, and all other flavours of quarks, I think it's best we go to the start,
355320	359160	dare I say it, to a world without Minecraft. Let's go.
360680	366120	This video is sponsored by Aura, and the following ad is only suitable for US citizens,
366120	369880	so if you're with me and old Blighty, then put on a cup of tea or something.
369880	374360	Austin, you're f***ing healing me. Heal me, you f***ing w- what, are you dumb b***h?
374360	377480	Harley, Harley, Harley, I don't really think you deserve heals, to be honest.
378040	380360	Hey, it's me, Bored Oranges, from YouTube.
380360	383160	Let the f***ing game, Oranges, stop flogging your channel.
383800	387560	Um, guys, I think my channel just got hacked.
387560	387960	Wow.
387960	388840	Jesus, really?
388840	389320	Holy shit.
389320	394280	I feel like, guys, I'm totally quitting Twitter, and you should give me all your money for, like, Tesla and crap and stuff.
394280	395560	Can somebody pick off that Moira?
395560	398600	Oh yeah, oh yeah, you're flogging Teslas now, Austin.
398600	400760	Elon's gonna be really, really hyped about that.
402040	405640	Shit, what am I even supposed to do right now? Do I contact support?
406360	407960	I do have one idea.
408520	410200	Have you heard of Aura?
410200	412360	No, uh, what is it?
413240	415160	Here, let me send you a link.
415160	419320	It's a privacy and security app. Sounds like something you might need.
419320	424440	I don't even think I could afford something like that, and how exactly is that going to help me now?
424440	427640	Well, thanks to a special deal I've been cooking up.
427640	432840	You can get two weeks absolutely free, so you don't have to worry about the cost while you are testing it out.
433960	436040	www.aura.com slash opinion.
437080	439960	Preferably, you'd make use of Aura before something bad happens,
439960	444200	but as it already has, we're going to try and stop the hackers in their tracks.
444200	446280	Do you still have access to your accounts?
446280	447800	Okay, hold on a sec.
447800	449880	Please heal me. Focus on the game.
451560	452440	Yes.
452440	453880	Okay, good, then this will be easy.
453880	457480	What we're going to do is kick out the hackers from your accounts before they change anything else,
457880	462360	and then make use of Aura's 256 AES encrypted password manager
462360	466200	to generate new, stronger passwords to make sure they never do this again.
466200	469720	Aura also lets you know if your current passwords are weak, and crucially,
469720	473720	if your passwords have been involved in data breaches and are exposed on the dark web.
473720	475720	Is anyone going to sort out that Reinhardt who keeps hitting my arse?
475720	479240	Oh, wow, that was really easy.
479240	481720	I was honestly worried there for a second.
481720	483960	Well, Aura makes staying safe online easy.
483960	486520	If you think that's good, wait till you hear about what else it can do.
486520	489720	My friend's been getting all these spam calls and emails due to data brokers
489720	491560	profiting off selling private information.
492120	494840	Aura will identify those data brokers that are selling your information
494840	497640	and automatically send them opt-out requests on your behalf.
497640	503240	Aura also does real-time credit and identity theft monitoring and has a VPN with an antivirus.

524040	525400	Now, back to the video.
525400	526680	Can we group up already?
533640	535240	The decade is the 1980s.
535240	538520	Technology is emerging pretty quickly, with various movements in the industry
538520	542920	taking the world by storm, with many pieces of media romanticizing its popularity.
542920	546520	However, enthusiasm for that sector was still treated with disdain by some,
546520	549400	and as many 80s coming-of-age films will likely tell you,
549400	553080	the cool kids were still the ones who could flatten some poor sod in a game of football.
553080	556200	For many, forms of technology were an outlet to keep them away from the
556200	559240	toxic social hierarchies they felt they couldn't compete in,
559240	563720	and by the 80s, one of the very important branches of technology was the video game.
563720	567560	In early times, you would have to commute to the arcade to have a taste of what video games
567560	571400	actually entailed, but with the increased commercial reach and accessibility of consoles,
571400	575160	the market opened up much more to those who enjoyed the pastime of gaming,
575160	579000	not just one of those people who wasn't really interested in being the coolest at school.
579000	582680	Deeply fascinated by mechanics from a young age, he spent much of his time indoors,
582680	586680	initially taking a keen interest in Lego, but soon turning his attention to his personal
586680	591240	Commodore 1 to a computer, either playing it or programming it, much of the time with codes
591240	593960	from a magazine network that his father was subscribed to.
593960	596600	At the age of eight, he produced his first video game,
596600	599880	one that he reassuringly informed an interviewer was basic.
600440	603160	Back then, these sorts of pastimes were vocational to many,
603160	606920	very few people knew exactly where artificial intelligence would be in 20 years time,
606920	610680	with some still arguing the idea that an online network could never be achieved,
610680	613080	and others claiming it would just be a fad regardless.
613080	616040	But over the years, it continued to defy many of its detractors,
616040	619640	with persisting developments and watershed moments that set the bar higher and higher
619640	621240	in scientific accomplishment.
621240	623880	With an expanding industry in an expanding market,
623880	627000	a person who had dropped out of high school likely sensed an opportunity.
627000	629560	His mother put him on a programming course to hone his talent,
629560	631880	and by the time he was 18, he had his first job.
640200	644440	After a few rocky periods in between, he was one of the first developers hired by a Stockholm-based
644440	648520	company then known as Midas Player, later to become King, the corporation who made the
648520	653640	legendary Candy Crush Stargut, inescapable from the daily lives of all, from our phones to our
653640	657880	skylines. The person worked on a fair few games during his 4-5 years stint at the company,
657880	661720	however he always kept one of his eyes on a few side projects that he would work on in his free
661720	667080	time, developing a fair few games to boot. In 2006, he released the Java-based game Worm Online,
667080	671720	a game he had developed with long-time friend Rolf Jensen, a sandbox MMO where players could
671720	676200	construct buildings, mine for materials, and craft tools. Sound familiar?
676200	679960	Well, there were a few differences, it's definitely a bit more complex, probably leaning more into
679960	684360	games like RuneScape for its more detailed visuals and skill level system that provides people with
684360	689000	a clear roadmap to mastery of the arts. However, there is also a more factional element that allows
689000	693320	people to join villages and allies, declare on others if they want, alongside a religious system
693320	697960	that allows people to worship a certain deity, each one having their own unique perks. It provides
697960	702040	an arrangement where users essentially create their own lore and history within the game.
702040	706920	It's a clever system, and the game does appear to have some popularity to this day, but in 2007,
706920	710840	the year after Worm was first released, Notch stepped away from his commitment to the game,
710840	716280	and the studio, then known as Mojang Specifications AB. Despite moving on from this
716280	721000	venture, person wished to retain the namesake Mojang for his next project. However, afraid of
721000	726040	market competition, Midas player barred him, and all employees from making games in their free time.
726040	730680	However, clearly valuing his individual creativity, Notch responded by quitting his job,
730680	734760	taking up work at a friendlier employer, and dedicating the following months to replicating
734760	736920	a game by the name of Infiniminer.
741800	750280	Infiniminer is a block-based sandbox game in which a player harvests minerals by cutting through
750280	755240	procedurally generated maps. Sound familiar? Well, yeah, this one should really. Infiniminer was
755240	760440	released by indie developer Zachtronics, named after its founder, Zach Barr. It wasn't particularly
760440	764680	hyped on release, and hadn't created large grounds well after, but it caught the attention of Marcus,
764680	769160	who said that although it had a clear character, still left a lot to the imagination. At the time
769160	773320	Marcus had been working on a project known as Ruby Dunk, a base building game in which he had
773320	777400	experimented with a feature that enabled first person perspective, but ultimately felt it was
777400	782600	too undeveloped in its current format. Although Person admired many aspects of Infiniminer,
782600	787000	he wished to create an environment that leaned into the more RPG theme, one that would emphasize
787000	791480	survival in the wilderness. He also wanted to focus on details of the in-game experience,
791480	795800	sound effects that would relate to each individual action, and how a player base may respond to that.
799160	811640	On May the 13th, 2009, Notch, using an account by the name of Ninzotch on YouTube, posted a video
811640	816840	titled Cave Game Tech Test. This upload was well received by users at the time, and a couple days
816840	819880	later, he seemed to have settled on a name, Minecraft.
830680	834760	In this time, Notch continued to post updates to his YouTube channel and personal Tumblr blog that
834760	839000	followed progress on the game pretty closely. Four days after posting Cave Game Tech Test,
839000	842680	he opened up the game to the public, providing users with a link if they wish to play it
842680	846760	themselves. Notch predominantly used forums for the independent game source to distribute his
846760	850920	new project, the same one that he had found Infiniminer on. There wasn't any real big
850920	854360	promotional push, nor was there any large investment from companies who believed in
854360	858520	the project, it was the true definition of an indie game. Just over 20 years after he had
858520	863080	created his first game on the Commodore 128, he had published a humble sandbox game on Java,
863080	867000	but the world was a lot larger now and dominated by companies who had a million times the resources
867000	873000	of a person like Persons. Indie games were a dime a dozen, and Notch's couldn't have been that unique, right?
876760	892840	Intro
892840	897400	Very few people know when they're making their magnum opus that it will be their magnum opus.
897800	906200	Intro
906200	910200	You can speculate how people will receive it, but you can never foresee public reaction,
910200	913560	and you can never account for every single issue that a consumer might point out.
913560	917080	When Notch first made the game playable, there were more than enough issues to count,
917080	920760	and many people were the first to let him know. However, there was definitely something unique
920760	924680	about Minecraft from the off. I'm not going to go through every detail, because there are creators
924680	928760	out there who are much more enthusiastic than me and have made it far more in-depth videos, but I
928760	933000	think the best way to summarise would be to say that it on one hand being a rather simple sandbox
933000	937320	allowed for a rather broad range of virtual realities, one where a world could be built around
937320	941720	your vision. At the same time, the RPG element, the first person perspective, gave it a more
941720	946040	competitive element and rewarded a person for the proficiency and skills required for survival.
946040	950440	Whereas Notch's previous game Worm had a system built on levels that was meant to supply an outward
950440	955560	motive for mastery, Minecraft was inherent. It was a simple system, but it was one that works,
955560	960360	and one that you progress through naturally. A bedrock so basic that can create a world so
960360	965000	complex. I think the best thing that can be said about the game is that you never have the exact
965000	969640	same experience twice, and for many that was embodied by the existence of Minecraft. The
969640	973320	familiar aspects were there, you never had to relearn the fundamentals, there was never an
973320	977000	alienation of experience, and many of the processes were as simple as a few clicks,
977000	981320	but the opportunities branched off each time you decided to take your experience to the world in a
981320	985720	new direction. The visual design was unvarnished, making it undemanding to be seized and accessible
985720	989880	to many users, still retaining its own charm and feeling that it was intentional. It was also
989880	995160	assisted by a barebones yet effective soundtrack and sound design by C418, another frequent user
995160	1000200	of the independent game source forum. His work can be identified by most from a single chord,
1000200	1005560	and that's impressive. Yet a game is more than its premise, and can never be flawless on launch.
1005560	1008920	That couldn't be more applicable to a game like Minecraft, which Notch decided to make
1008920	1012840	playable from the preliminary stages of production. Notch couldn't necessarily afford
1012840	1017000	his own game testers, so he relied on the feedback from users. You could tell that when it was first
1017000	1020680	published it was still in its teething era. Although many people enjoyed it, Marcus was
1020680	1025240	inundated with recommendations and requests from gamers who felt their experience could be enhanced,
1025240	1029480	and Notch was on it, regularly responding to people and applying updates as soon as his day
1029480	1033960	job was finished. Within three days of making the alpha open to all users, he had added a variety of
1033960	1038200	features and continued to do so over the coming weeks, including a multiplayer mode at the turn
1038200	1042360	of June. Much of this was conferred through the forums, but it soon expanded to his personal blog
1042360	1046360	and equivalent social media that became dedicated to following the progress of the game as it
1046360	1050760	garnered more and more interest from the wider internet. With the increasing popularity and
1050760	1054440	knowledge that he would probably need funds to sustain development, Notch moved the game into
1054440	1058920	a paid alpha stage for those who wanted a few more modes at their disposal. Unlike a lot of indie
1058920	1063080	games trying to capitalise on the popularity, Notch actually made a decision to make his game
1063080	1067560	a bit more expensive than he had initially valued it, linking an essay explaining the importance of
1067560	1071880	not underselling indie games. In spite of this, many people happily obliged and continued to
1071880	1076520	spread the word, leading to a snowball effect that resulted in more and more users. Videos, tweets,
1076520	1081000	posts, onto a variety of social media websites continued to serve as Notch's own unpaid
1081000	1085640	promotional campaign, and gave person all the time he wanted to focus on quality control,
1085640	1090360	and to be fair to him, that's exactly what he did. With the rate of unexpected success
1090360	1093640	that Notch was experiencing, it would have been easy for him to rest on his laurels or
1093640	1097880	sell his work onto an eager investor. However, with each passing day he only seemed to dedicate
1097880	1102040	more and more time to perfecting and updating the craft of this humble mining game. His
1102040	1106520	proactiveness in actually attending to problems and responding to feedback didn't seem to let up,
1106520	1110840	even as the game seemingly expanded beyond a single person's capability. He switched his day job
1110840	1115000	to part-time, hired a couple people to help him manage designs, but still placed himself at the
1115000	1119320	creative control panel of this undertaking, maintaining activity and status in the forums
1119320	1123880	that had so graciously supported his project. He was still a one-man army, and amongst many was
1123880	1128200	quickly obtaining status as a bit of a cult figure. However, things were beginning to spiral
1128200	1132920	out of control a little. In the first year the game moved around 25,000 copies, pretty good for
1132920	1137240	an indie game, but in 2010 it began to garner even more traction, selling thousands of copies in the
1137240	1142520	space of a day. So much income was being generated from sales that, suspecting fraud, PayPal froze
1142520	1146920	his account, which subsequently just generated more publicity. I mean, the dude was literally
1146920	1151080	keeping hundreds of thousands in his PayPal. Although Notch was on top of his game, he didn't
1151080	1155560	seem to be on top of his fame, there were some things that he just could not do on his own.
1155560	1160920	Enter stage right now, the video game's mammoth headed by another popular figure, Gabe Newell.
1160920	1165000	Noticing the success of Minecraft and the man behind it, they invited him over to Bellevue,
1165000	1168440	Washington to see what the prospects of future work could be. They showed him around the
1168440	1172360	headquarters, made him take some programming assessments, even having him meet with President
1172360	1176600	Mr. Newell himself. All in all, it was quite the experience, and although they believed he
1176600	1180040	had a bit to learn, they were happy to offer him a job that would hopefully provide him with a bit
1180040	1183640	of stability. However, that wasn't the only thing that happened in Bellevue.
1189880	1193720	When Notch announced he was travelling to Valve headquarters in the US, many people asked him if
1193720	1198040	a meetup was possible. Person, thinking it could be a nice initiative, decided to announce the
1198040	1202600	meeting on his Tumblr blog, jovially labelling it MinecraftCon, saying that it could be a good
1202600	1206920	idea even if it's just three people sitting around in uncomfortable silence for 20 minutes.
1206920	1212040	It wasn't quite that though, in fact over 50 people turned up, including one person in a full
1212040	1216040	creeper costume. Although it didn't last for more than a few hours, it might just have been enough
1216040	1220040	to convince Notch that although Valve's offer was likely flattering, there may be something
1220040	1224760	more worthwhile in what he already had. So he turned down the move to Valve, and instead called
1224760	1229400	up his longtime friend Jakob Pulsa, expressing the desire to take this whole little Minecraft
1229400	1233400	gig a little bit more seriously. But was that what Notch wanted?
1237320	1242040	Upon returning to Sweden, Person and Pulsa incorporated their business as Mojang AB,
1242040	1246360	later to be Mojang Studios, and brought on some additional manpower to their workforce.
1246360	1250120	They decided to commit a bit more time to game development in general, even beginning to work on
1250120	1254600	another game called Scrolls, though it's now known as Call as Bane. It seems the wheels were firmly
1254600	1259400	in motion on the Mojang machine, and not too soon after Notch was vindicated for his decision made
1259400	1263960	in September, because Minecraft's growth didn't slow, in fact it did quite the opposite, even
1263960	1268120	beginning to capture the attention of mainstream media sources. Less than 20 days after his visit
1268120	1272440	to Bellevue, a YouTube video on Minecraft topped the platform's gaming charts for the first time,
1272440	1277880	and by the end of October they had moved 500,000 copies, and by the end of the year PC Gamer UK had
1277880	1283800	heralded it as the game of the year, all while still in beta. In many ways the offer on Valve
1283800	1287800	is just what someone like Notch needed. This was a dude who had seemed a bit out of his depth at
1287800	1291480	the time, hell, he was storing hundreds of thousands of pounds in his Paypal account,
1291480	1295320	it felt like the backing of a more stable source of income was just what he needed. However,
1295320	1299880	something tells me Notch didn't bank his success on the amount of income his little project generated.
1299880	1304520	Nobody could have foreseen the success of a humble game initially posted onto an independent forum,
1304520	1308120	especially Person, and really his ability to follow this through wouldn't depend on the
1308120	1312600	amount of money he made, but more his own spark for the game, something that he clearly still
1312600	1313800	believed he possessed.
1313800	1317800	Does it just still make you happy to just keep working on the game every day?
1317800	1324360	Yeah, so far yes. We got another game being prototyped and it's really fun to think about that,
1324360	1328680	but so far the most fun is when I can actually just work on Minecraft.
1328680	1332600	With the attention of major developers like Valve, it would have been very easy to let his elevated
1332600	1336520	status get to him, but like a lot of accidental celebrities, Notch didn't really seem to view
1336520	1340680	himself as one, he just wanted to keep working on his project, but that was at least somewhat
1340680	1345240	difficult as the user base continued to manifest. He didn't make the game early access to the entire
1345240	1349560	world with the intent of having the entire world play it, he had to adapt, and the new business
1349560	1353960	model seemed like the best way forward. With a new business, there are new responsibilities,
1353960	1356600	particularly if a game wants to continue to rule the market.
1357240	1362040	In 2011, to consolidate their prosperity, the Mojang crew began to work on new versions for
1362040	1366600	other platforms, initially for mobile devices, but console projects followed not too long after.
1366600	1370360	The company also made the decision to start publishing games from other indie studios,
1370360	1375320	additionally after the success of the spontaneous meetup in 2010, it was decided that MineCon would
1375320	1380440	become an official event, it was planned to occur from the 18th to the 19th of October in Las Vegas.
1380440	1384520	Everything was moving forward pretty smoothly, but was that the case for our title character?
1385080	1388440	Notch really was the first of his kind in many ways, and he was certainly one of the first who
1388440	1392840	became known among many for just being a developer. Although that was partly attributable to the
1392840	1396600	success of the game, it was also a credit to his hands on nature and actual interest in the
1396600	1400520	community that surrounded it. It was clear that he didn't wish to take any single person for
1400520	1404600	granted, however there's a reason that sort of approach isn't typically linked to celebrities,
1404600	1409640	to put it plainly, it's impossible to maintain. I'd say the best allegory is that of the YouTube
1409640	1413400	channel really, there are people who when they start their channel will respond to every single
1413400	1417160	comment and try and give as much attention to anybody who takes an interest in their work,
1417160	1421240	but the attention may grow to the point where you cannot tangibly engage with everyone without
1421240	1425960	sacrificing other aspects of the creative process. What people loved Notch for was a quality that
1425960	1430600	would inevitably become incompatible with his status, and with that comes a few complications.
1431160	1434840	When you have a small project, the first people who believe in it and support it are some of the
1434840	1438520	most important supporters you can have, as they're the ones who may help you find your feet in
1438520	1442680	momentum. If you reciprocate that positive attention, then these people will enjoy engaging
1442680	1446680	with you because many of them appreciate being listened to, and their voice actually having
1446680	1450600	influence. As a project grows, their voice will be diluted though, and this leads to more
1450600	1454520	dissatisfaction, the allegations that you sold out, that you're not who you used to be, you've
1454520	1459160	become lazy, etc, and you're going to come across people with completely conflicting visions of what
1459160	1463320	you should do with your content, which often just leads to nobody being satisfied. Some of these
1463320	1467240	dedicated individuals were also becoming increasingly obsessed with Notch's life,
1467240	1471960	including to the point where someone created a timeline of his in-work absences. Even if he
1471960	1476760	tried his utmost hardest, there was no way that Notch's position was sustainable, and over 2011
1476760	1481720	as pressure continued to rise it was clear that he was, as they would say, suffering from success.
1482280	1487000	In a Reddit AMA in April 2011, Notch acknowledges his nature to overstress and focus on the
1487000	1491720	negativity, particularly over a runaway success like Minecraft. Hava also says he has made a
1491720	1496040	commitment to managing it better, he seemed to be doing an okay job at managing that at first,
1496040	1500200	but over the year this struggle appeared to resurface. This likely wasn't alleviated when
1500200	1504360	Bethesda filed a lawsuit claiming the game's scrolls were too similar to the Elder Scrolls,
1504360	1509400	which led to a months-long legal back and forth. Notch prevailed, but at what cost? This seemed to
1509400	1514760	climax in the 2011 Minecon, which also marked the official release of Minecraft. There was every
1514760	1519320	reason to celebrate, however it was marked by an incident involving a couple YouTubers,
1519320	1521480	part of the channel known as the Yogscast.
1521480	1541640	In their time, the Yogscast were one of the largest and most influential gaming channels
1541640	1545960	on YouTube. Some of their members were also enthusiastic devotees of Minecraft, and Notch
1545960	1550520	in return sang his praises for their work, so their appearance of Minecon 2011 should have been
1550520	1554200	a match made in heaven. However, not too long after their appearance on the final night,
1554200	1558440	a sleep-deprived Notch sent a series of enraged tweets that called out the pair for their supposed
1558440	1563000	delinquent behaviour which included cursing, insulting, and all-around incendiary behaviour.
1563000	1567000	Yogscast responded on their subreddit, disputing Notch's version of events and criticising the
1567000	1571480	general organisation of Minecon. This tension persisted for a day or so before Notch relented
1571480	1575560	and put out another statement apologising for his approach, and admitting it was likely a
1575560	1579560	stress-related misunderstanding. At the height of his success, Notch should have at least been
1579560	1584280	enjoying himself, yet it seemed that it was anything but that, and it's not surprising.
1584280	1588520	He was never a person who enjoyed the public spotlight, and this increased level of tension,
1588520	1592920	especially at an event like Minecon, was only going to escalate that further.
1592920	1606280	The guy needed a break, but would he ever get it?
1622920	1634360	As noted, Notch's approach to management wasn't really one that adapted to the levels of
1634360	1638360	attention that he received. He didn't do it badly for what it was worth, but eventually you can't
1638360	1642440	keep up with the continued public analysis of your existence, particularly when it's committed to a
1642440	1646360	game that should really enable you to block out the world around you. So approximately a couple
1646360	1650120	weeks after the official launch of Minecraft and Notch's little incident with the Yogscast,
1650120	1652840	he announced he was stepping down as head programmer.
1652840	1656280	The title of the post is in Swedish, a statement meaning with those words
1656280	1660280	I hand over the microphone, with the rest of the short blog elaborating on a statement.
1660280	1664600	The new head designer Jens Bergensten, also known as Jeb, had been working hard on developing the
1664600	1668360	game's scrolls. The person was impressed by his work, and felt like he was the right person to
1668360	1672680	take the game forward. He doesn't really talk too much about his own mental state, only saying that
1672680	1677640	he will rest for a while, but intends to continue to help out Minecraft. With all things considered,
1677640	1681560	this was probably the right decision, it would ease the public expectation while still allowing
1681560	1686040	him to offer insight and ideas for his brainchild. Bergensten is by no means anonymous, and I don't
1686040	1690360	want to suggest that, but Notch was still the face of the company in many regards, just one that had
1690360	1694840	been stretched a bit too thin over the past few years, but would that be enough? Well, I think
1694840	1699000	the key is perspective really. The move as it had been presented was one for a person's own
1699000	1702840	wellbeing, however I think that Notch had to believe it himself, because whether he liked it
1702840	1707240	or not, people still primarily associated Minecraft with him above anything else, and with that in
1707240	1711000	mind there were still going to be people who held him responsible for the upkeep of the game,
1711000	1715240	even if it wasn't technically his obligation at all. Notch had to simply accept that these people
1715240	1719640	would exist, and stop caring about them. I think one of the problems with Notch is that he couldn't
1719640	1723800	really escape his status, I think the move lifted some mandate to do work off his shoulders,
1723800	1727960	but otherwise he was still the centre of attention, particularly as now I have a Twitter user. He also
1727960	1731880	wasn't really much of a professional when it came to his content, this wasn't an insult really,
1731880	1736600	but as you know many companies make their public representation as bereft in personality as
1736600	1740600	possible. Notch always presented himself as a friend of the user, unlike a lot of large
1740600	1744520	companies, his stance on piracy was mostly different, occasionally even encouraging people.
1744520	1748920	He resented large companies for their acquisitions such as Google taking over YouTube, he came across
1748920	1754200	as a video game populist, but I think having such stances is always going to come with his perils.
1754200	1758280	Notch was still a significant force in a lot of decisions made around Mojang. Sure he wasn't the
1758280	1762440	number one guy for design, but as I'm sure he found out soon enough, running a company came with
1762440	1766520	more than enough baggage of its own, and eventually although you can find his position as an advocate
1767080	1771480	respectable, you soon realise why a lot of companies don't have that sort of representation.
1772120	1776120	Ultimately, Notch still bore the brunt of the decisions made by the company, even ones not
1776120	1780040	made by himself, so he was regularly bombarded with requests that he could not fulfil without
1780040	1783960	going over Jeff's head, something that he had pledged not to do, however if he didn't enact
1783960	1788120	those changes he'd be subject to a litany of rather unpleasant words, something that he took
1788120	1791960	more personally than he should have. He was an inherently high stress person who wanted to solve
1791960	1796360	every person's issue, but knew he shouldn't. Being the video game populist isn't easy when
1796360	1800360	he was no longer the friendly game developer behind the screen, and had a multi-million dollar
1800360	1804840	franchise to oversee. In the end Notch became much more preoccupied with covering the decisions
1804840	1808600	that concerned business, sometimes dealing with complaints from large companies who weren't happy
1808600	1812120	that people were recreating their content in Minecraft. On the other side, people were
1812120	1815960	dissatisfied every time he made an executive decision that people felt may have affected a
1815960	1820200	player's in-game experience, even if it was one he felt was the right thing to do or absolutely
1820200	1824520	necessary. The sandbox format, which in many ways with the game's core appeal also began to
1824520	1828440	generate some controversy of its own over the years, now in many ways what happens in a game
1828440	1832600	like Minecraft is a player's own discretion, and developers can't be expected to intervene in every
1832600	1836280	server that offends people's sensibilities, particularly on a game with the number of servers
1836280	1841000	that Minecraft has. However, as the antics became more and more far-fetched, pressure began to mount
1841000	1847480	ultimately climaxing in a situation regarding in-game transactions. It was mid-2014, summer was
1847480	1852040	approaching quickly, but it was not all sunshine on the Minecraft servers. Discourse had flared up
1852040	1856440	on Twitter, as it always does, on the issue of donating to servers that offer certain services.
1856440	1860520	Responding to this, Mojang spokesperson Owen Hill explained that although people are more than
1860520	1864600	welcome to donate to servers, it couldn't be an exchange for equipment that gave you an in-game
1864600	1869560	advantage. Soft pay-to-win essentially. However, many users didn't agree with this and began a
1869560	1874760	hashtag titled SaveMinecraft. Although this stance was not new for Mojang, they were not known to
1874760	1878840	have enforced it, and this newfound attention drew ire from many users, who felt there were
1878840	1883880	many good servers whose existence relied on such transactions. Not frustrated by the decision
1883880	1888040	surrounding the topic did what he did best, and took to his personal blog to write a response
1888040	1891800	explaining his perspective, and explained that nothing had changed. This had always been their
1891800	1896760	stance on the matter, as written in the EULA, the End User Licence Agreement. They did not want to
1896760	1901480	sacrifice the don't pay for the gameplay principle that had motivated them all this time. Nevertheless,
1901480	1905880	the user base did not subside, some of whom pointing towards the recent Minecraft Realms
1905880	1910200	release as being a motivating factor for Mojang's decision to turn their attention towards other
1910200	1914360	paid servers. Realms was launched the month before, and allowed a person to pay £8 a month
1914360	1918680	to have private servers for up to 20 friends. This large-scale service drew comparisons that
1918680	1923480	maybe Minecraft was trying to decrease competition, not truly acting in the interest of users,
1923480	1928360	which likely provoked a more cynical response from gamers. Notch from his perspective clearly
1928360	1932280	felt like he was doing the right thing, and he always took a lot of pride in it. He was always
1932280	1936360	facing off with the sect of people who believed he was acting in his own self-interest, and with
1936360	1941560	the large-scale movement against the decision that he felt was pretty cut and dry was the final straw.
1941560	1946360	So on the 16th of June, a frustrated and enraged Notch typed out a tweet in the heat of the moment,
1947240	1949080	and everything changed.
1958360	1967000	Anyone want to buy my share of Mojang so I can move on with my life? Getting hate for
1967000	1971400	trying to do the right thing is not my gig. The tweet in question wasn't a serious business
1971400	1975720	proposition, but it did catch the attention of a few serious businesses, who contacted Notch's
1975720	1980040	colleagues and asked him if he was for real. At first unsure, the idea of being able to completely
1980040	1985160	disassociate from all the burdens he felt saddled with began to inspire some ideas. Every major
1985160	1989320	company knew the cash cow that Mojang was, a business with less than 50 employees, yet
1989320	1993320	generating hundreds of millions in revenue each year. It was a corporate wet dream, and if they
1993320	1997160	were going to sell, there was hardly a gaming behemoth that didn't want a slice. However,
1997160	2001320	it didn't take too long for the frontrunner to emerge. That frontrunner was the humble,
2001320	2004280	full-scale firm known as Microsoft.
2004280	2009160	So how do you run your Minecraft company? Have you sold out to the evil corporations yet?
2009880	2011320	No, not yet. We hope not to.
2011320	2015080	Now, to be fair, the company had to be somewhat large to even afford to buy out the shares on
2015080	2019000	offer. We'll get to the price of the deal in a bit, but Notch wanted a company who were in
2019000	2023400	touch with the preservation of what made Minecraft special. He had dealt with Microsoft before,
2023400	2027320	occasionally expressing frustration with their practices, but regularly also demonstrating
2027320	2031480	affection for those who he worked with to bring Minecraft to their platforms, even at some points
2031480	2036120	promoting rumours of an exclusivity deal, which he seemed to sarcastically refer to. All I can
2036120	2040360	affirmatively say is they were probably a better choice to Notch than EA. With this in mind,
2040360	2044760	Microsoft moved in to close the deal. They had the additional motive of the ever wholesome subject
2044760	2049480	of tax avoidance due to our functioning economic system, a deal with Mojang would facilitate.
2049480	2053320	You'd love to see it. So they were prepared to offer the big bucks, and when I say big,
2053320	2057960	I mean hard to even quantify. Person's shares totaled just shy of 1.8 billion dollars,
2057960	2063160	Paul's shares around 300 million, and then CEO Carl Manet's shares 100 million,
2063160	2067720	not your average shopping bill to say the least. This was all finalised and officially announced
2067720	2073320	on the 15th of September 2014, with a post on Notch's Tumblr titled I'm Leaving Mojang,
2073320	2077240	which goes more into depth about how interactions with his user base had shaped his current
2077240	2081320	perspective. He already knew he would never be able to recreate a success like Minecraft,
2081320	2085560	but wanted to stay on as the figurehead because he believed there was some symbolic value to that.
2085560	2090040	Javi came to the conclusion that he didn't enjoy it, he was just really this space on a game that
2090040	2093800	he didn't really feel attached to anymore, a source of people's enjoyment and pain that he
2093800	2098120	didn't understand. In his words, he's merely a nerdy computer programmer who likes to have
2098120	2101960	opinions on Twitter. Although the money was nothing to turn your nose at, he stresses that
2101960	2106360	it wasn't about the money, it was about the sanity. I wonder how people would respond to that.
2107000	2110680	Well, most of them took it pretty well actually, there were a few people who regarded him as a
2110680	2114520	sellout, but he'd been called a sellout by plenty of people in his time, and that wasn't anything
2114520	2118120	new. It was obviously difficult for some people to rationalise given that the person had always
2118120	2122840	been outspoken about a lot of the threatening overreach of big tech, but his move wasn't really
2122840	2127000	one for any of the companies, it wasn't an endorsement of such, it was just what he thought
2127000	2131960	was best for himself, he had to get out, and that was his way. Among other people affected by this
2131960	2136520	were the members of staff, upon learning on his departure they were reported to be disappointed,
2136520	2140920	and that makes sense especially given they were now under the gaze of a much more cutthroat company,
2140920	2144760	but Notch had taken steps to ensure that no layoffs would occur, which given the modest
2144760	2149400	numbers of Mojang's workforce, Microsoft were happy to abide by. All staff members who remained
2149400	2153880	at the company for the next six months also received a $300,000 bonus from Notch's share,
2153880	2157720	which obviously wasn't anything near the levels of money Marcus had been paid, but it wasn't
2157720	2162040	derisory either. It was generally reported that Microsoft mostly took a hands-off approach and
2162040	2165960	merely offered their resources and investment to the team over at Mojang in exchange for the
2165960	2170040	profits they were making. Overall it was considered by most to be an example of a transaction done
2170040	2174040	right, one that didn't lead to the immediate demise of a product or those who worked tirelessly
2174040	2178360	on it. At the same time, although you'd be hard-pressed not to understand Person's viewpoint,
2178360	2182360	it's hard not to feel a bit solemn about the circumstances that precipitated it.
2182440	2187080	Although Person's tenure probably did centralise his status a bit too much, I mean hell, he once
2187080	2191720	placed above Barack Obama in a time person of the year poll. His success was still an inspiration to
2191720	2196360	many, he'd become representative of an individual creative using the online world to make something
2196360	2201720	greater than any major studio could ever concoct, and his concern for personally involving himself
2201720	2206040	in creating a consumer-based experience felt refreshing for many who played the game. It
2206040	2210520	created a community with an identifiable figure at the centre of it. His departure didn't mean
2210520	2214280	the game was suddenly going to take a nosedive, and in a way some people's fallacious belief that
2214280	2218200	he was one of the key factors in maintaining the game's appeal was disproven after he left,
2218200	2222360	but it did reduce the power of the community on a large company who isn't really known for their
2222360	2227240	consumer empowerment. Eventually those aspects of corporatism were going to seep in, and there'd
2227240	2232600	be nothing that anyone could do about it. Sometimes it's nice just to have someone there to listen.
2232600	2236680	Ultimately this was all rooted in a situation though where the person who listened had heard
2236680	2240920	enough. Anyone who cares that much about a game is not going to be able to withstand the pressure
2240920	2245480	of maintaining it. Minecraft was one person's passion that became so much greater than that.
2245480	2249480	In Notch's statement he writes, if I ever accidentally make something that seems to gain
2249480	2253880	traction, I'll probably abandon it immediately. Some people may have been able to navigate the
2253880	2258920	tricky social environment better, but Notch was not that person, he never was. That's what made
2258920	2263240	him popular, that's what made him like, he was the everyman, he was the underdog who rose up to change
2263240	2267160	the gaming industry, he didn't have politically adept social skills or a decade-long college
2267160	2271640	education, he was a guy who just did what he felt like doing. He showed that the stereotype
2271640	2276280	for the nerd staying in his room on his computer wasn't as negative as some thought it to be.
2276280	2280120	In the end the popularity made his status untenable though, he couldn't be everybody's
2280120	2284040	everyman, but he still walked away from a game that would revere him as one of the greatest
2284040	2288520	examples of independent enterprise in modern history. Well, he could have.
2293240	2301640	Marcus Persson was rich, and everyone knew it.
2301640	2306040	It's hard not to let success change you in some way, and often you should change with success,
2306040	2309640	because it typically places you in a different position than one you were in previously.
2309640	2313640	Even if you didn't intend on becoming famous, if you're going to continue operating in that
2313640	2318280	domain you have to adapt. While he was working on Minecraft, Notch seemed hesitant to do that.
2318280	2323000	In 2011 he made over 100 million dollars, and his response to questions on how he was going
2323000	2327880	to spend it was perhaps obtaining a driver's license and a car, almost comedically modest.
2327880	2332200	When he did splash out it was only really with other people, such as work trips and conventions.
2332200	2336280	He obviously cared less about his shopping bill than most, but he never seemed to let that wealth
2336280	2341000	distract him from the lifestyle he was accustomed to. However, the sale of his shares in Minecraft
2341000	2344680	changed that, not just because it earned him an obscene amount of money at once, but because it
2344760	2349320	removed a commitment that he had felt attached to for years. As long as he was tied to that game,
2349320	2353160	no matter how much money he made, Notch seemed almost paranoid that it could still collapse
2353160	2357000	at any moment. He waited over a year to fully quit his job, despite the fact that Minecraft
2357000	2361880	was generating far more income. Even when success seemed near guaranteed, Notch felt the reputation
2361880	2366040	of a game weighing on his actions. That was gone now, and he had all the time to do what he wanted
2366040	2372120	to. Well, what would he do? He decided to treat himself, it seems. First on his list of goodies
2372120	2376360	was a new abode. Person went for the ever popular celebrity location in Beverly Hills,
2376360	2381640	spending 70 million dollars and outbidding Jay-Z and Beyonce on a 23,000 square foot mansion with
2381640	2386440	its own carlift. How quaint. It was soon reported that he had been spending his nights in Las Vegas
2386440	2390920	blowing upwards of 100k in a single outing to the nightclubs, casinos, and the rest. In interviews,
2390920	2395320	his mantra appeared that he was making up for lost time, and everything he was never able to do as a
2395320	2399240	young adult working his ass off in the industry. He acknowledged that it wasn't the wisest way to
2399240	2403720	spend one's fortunes, but it was for him. He was living the high life, that much is true,
2403720	2409880	private rooftop pools, crystal champagne, and Skrillex, the ultimate triad. This was all shared
2409880	2413640	through his Twitter and Instagram, which now served a very different purpose for Notch, and
2413640	2417800	his attitude certainly reflected that. When people tried to dunk on him, he'd regularly respond with
2417800	2421480	memes and lighthearted jives to show that ultimately, whatever people said wouldn't change
2421480	2425480	where he was at with life. In spite of all this, he had pledged to donate a fair sum of his money
2425480	2430200	to charity, and set some aside for family, but life is more than what you want to do with money.
2430760	2436600	What other plans did he have? Well, it appeared uncertain. On the 3rd of March 2015,
2436600	2440840	an interview was published with Forbes that delved into the headspace of Notch following the sale.
2440840	2445160	It reported that he had since started a new company known as Rubberbrain, located in central
2445160	2448760	Stockholm. Him and his colleagues had been throwing around some new ideas and occasionally
2448760	2452760	testing them, but mostly just trying to have a good time. Whatever their plans were, it wasn't
2452760	2456920	to create a new blockbuster. On the question of his place in the current gaming environment,
2456920	2460920	he didn't really know where he wanted to be, but one thing was certain, that he hadn't regretted
2460920	2466120	selling his shares, he just wanted to pass away the days having a good time with his friends.
2466120	2470760	But how long would that last? I have a good friend who posted a principle in a philosophical
2470760	2475160	discussion we were having a few months ago, the necessity of human struggle. His argument
2475160	2480200	basically suggested that we as people need to experience some aspect of adversity to truly feel
2480200	2485000	fulfilled. He likened it to a room that closes in on a person, the idea that many of us need those
2485000	2489240	walls to push back against, something of a challenge, or what else if we ultimately lose our
2489240	2493240	own purpose in the world. Now obviously some people struggle far too much, and other people
2493240	2497080	get by alright without struggling, but I think there is a relevance, particularly for people who
2497080	2501720	are used to some form of pressure, to have that completely removed from them. It's a very difficult
2501720	2505960	environment to adapt to. Struggle is relative, and if you've spent your whole life with this strong
2505960	2510440	sense of purpose, to have yourself completely absolved of that purpose is quite jarring,
2510440	2514760	and barely a few months after the Forbes article was published, Notch's celebratory tone appeared
2514760	2519880	to take a turn towards something more pessimistic. On August the 29th, Notch sent out a series of
2519880	2523480	tweets that appeared to lament his current lifestyle, initiating with the statement,
2523480	2527720	the problem with getting everything is you run out of reasons to keep trying, and human interaction
2527720	2532120	becomes impossible due to imbalance. Notch then proceeds to talk about how although he has
2532120	2536440	everything, he feels completely alienated, unable to create a human connection with those around
2536440	2541240	him, especially on an intimate basis as people find his lifestyle overwhelming. He also seems
2541240	2545000	frustrated at the fact that many of his former colleagues still seem to resent him, despite
2545000	2549080	him believing that he treated them well. When one of the employees says that much of the response
2549080	2553720	was just the initial shock, he completely flips out on them, saying fuck all of you, which seemed
2553720	2558840	a bit much for many people at the time. He had no trust for the world around him, and it shows.
2558840	2562920	The mail cloud may have been momentary for many, but it certainly outlined a real cloud to the
2562920	2567640	silver lining of selling out. Unfortunately Notch had reached this stage of success and influence
2567640	2571720	where people treat you differently because of it. Even people close to you can seem distant,
2571720	2576520	and you can't really trust their intent. You need mental fortitude to manage that, and to be frank,
2576520	2582120	Marcus was a somewhat fragile person, and once the initial euphoria of that newfound wealth wore out,
2582120	2587080	he probably wondered what was left. This brief tirade inspired a few reports and response articles
2587080	2591160	from people who didn't necessarily have great sympathy for his predicament, but probably prompted
2591160	2595960	the same suggestion for a solution. Person needed to find a way to alienate himself from that wealth
2595960	2601400	and status. It's not an easy solution to undertake, but the problem will continue to be inescapable as
2601400	2605720	long as he had nothing to work for and nobody to actually share it with. Snoop Dogg even weighed
2605720	2610200	in on the matter, reminding persons that knowing who your real ones are is much more important than
2610200	2615080	any material wealth. I don't think anyone needs Notch's level of money to be happy. You shouldn't
2615080	2618840	have to give away your wealth to be happy necessarily, but you need to have something that can
2618840	2624120	transcend the purpose of that money, whether that be friends, work, or an alternative outlet. Reflecting
2624120	2629000	on Notch's life, maybe his purpose was rooted in a struggle of sorts with Minecraft, and optimizing
2629000	2634360	it, and now that it ended, so had Person's own greater sense of self. Marcus Person was rich,
2634360	2638760	and everyone knew it, but for someone like him, that was seeming more like a curse and a blessing,
2638760	2643320	and his rant, although aggressive, was to show great vulnerability. He needed something greater
2643320	2646120	to latch on to, but maybe we got something worse.
2653640	2657640	A few days after his venting session on the social media website, Notch decided to respond
2657640	2661800	to those who suggested that he give his wealth away, stating that money wasn't the problem,
2661800	2666280	it was the lifestyle, and although he may not be wrong, if you let your money influence your
2666280	2670360	lifestyle then you're feeding the problem, and less than a couple months later he was back in
2670360	2675480	Vegas. He seemed to attribute his current downcast mindset to the success, but he'd been successful
2675480	2679640	for a while, it was just that this time round he had something else to account for that success,
2679640	2684120	and it simply wasn't enough. It distanced himself from nearly everyone in his life, and made him
2684120	2689080	untrusting of the world around him. Notch was the paranoid wreck who had no idea of where he was
2689080	2693080	meant to go from here, and expressing it online wasn't going to help, as the whole place can often
2693080	2697000	feel like you're headed in circles. You'd think that after he sold his shares he'd have a lot less
2697000	2700920	to say on the world wide web, but for someone who didn't want to be the centre of attention anymore,
2700920	2705560	he often still seemed obsessed with social media platforms. In his departure post he characterised
2705560	2709800	himself as a nerdy computer programmer who likes to have opinions on Twitter, but it seemed more
2709800	2714120	than just the occasional hot takes at this point, to be honest he seemed ever more invested with the
2714120	2718440	goings on around him, and that only continued to manifest itself as the online world became
2718440	2723560	increasingly political. As we all know, 2016 was a strange time for the internet on reflection,
2723560	2729000	particularly with the cosmic rise of Donald Trump, and the general movement towards anti-SJW content
2729000	2733160	that seemed to target people who were not always the best at expressing their beliefs. When working
2733160	2737800	on Minecraft, Notch had generally seemed to adopt quite progressive ideas towards his game. Although
2737800	2741720	not overtly political, he said that every character was genderless, and that people had a right to
2741720	2745960	interpret each of them to their own liking. It was part of Minecraft after all, the fact that
2745960	2750440	an individual can have an experience personal to them. Despite not explicitly endorsing anyone
2750440	2754840	before 2016, Notch was someone who would have been mostly aware of the discourse within political
2754840	2759240	spheres, and throughout 2015 he had mostly expressed disdain for the prospective Republican
2759240	2763560	candidate, Donald Trump, calling him a loon, and exhibited genuine confusion at people's
2763560	2767560	belief in his suitability for office. He'd interacted with a few YouTubers who expressed
2767560	2772760	anti-SJW beliefs, and stated that he would support Bernie Sanders if choosing between him and Hillary.
2772760	2776360	As the US election approached, he seemed to become more and more invested in the issue though.
2776360	2780120	Although it is vocal that he was not a fan of Trump's, he turned most of his eye towards Hillary
2780120	2783960	Clinton, who he felt had acted dishonestly. I'm not going to go into every single detail
2783960	2787880	regarding his political beliefs at this specific point in time, but as election day approached,
2787880	2791560	his stance on Trump continued to soften, and eventually he admitted that if he was forced
2791560	2795560	to choose between Trump and Clinton, he would probably choose Trump. This wasn't an exceptional
2795560	2800040	stance at the time, particularly online, people's resentment for Clinton was very palpable, and many
2800040	2804200	didn't want her to win just for the principle that they thought the Democrats had the opportunity to
2804200	2808920	present a genuinely radical candidate, well at least by the standards of US politics. Trump
2808920	2813800	became the anti-hero, anti-establishment figure that in spite of his very visible flaws became
2813800	2818120	a punishment to all those happy to settle for a miserable status quo, therefore although his
2818120	2822840	opinions were a little outspoken for a person of his status, these didn't exactly strike anyone as
2822840	2827160	truly frightening. I think establishment is a very important word to use when analysing these
2827160	2831160	figures, because Notch is an independent game developer who cared deeply about the game he
2831160	2836040	designed, similarly saw himself as a figure taking on the long entrenched bureaucracies and structures
2836120	2839320	that they employed to stay in power. He'd always believed that many in the industry
2839320	2842760	players sacrificed user experience for their own gain, and they would try and
2842760	2846920	oppress any actual innovation. Notch was one of the few large gaming entrepreneurs who didn't
2846920	2851480	outwardly attack masses like piracy, he was an advocate for the little guy in in-game experience.
2851480	2855080	Additionally, he had always been largely skeptical of national governments, and expressed deep
2855080	2859400	concern about a surveillance state, particularly that relating to the US. That is where we
2859400	2864280	introduce the sort of SJW that he also seemed to rally against during the election of Donald Trump,
2864280	2868840	additionally crediting their behaviour as much to the reason that the Don got elected. The sort
2868840	2873240	of political correctness that many of them preached was not something Notch had ever related to.
2873240	2876840	Sure, he wasn't the sort of person who was particularly offensive or hurtful to people,
2876840	2881560	but he always saw issues like freedom of speech as being non-negotiable, he saw any attack on it as
2881560	2886120	an act of tyranny, designed to oppress people who may speak truth to power. He wanted to fight
2886120	2891160	against what he saw as this corporate sterilisation of people's expression. He was also becoming
2891160	2895160	increasingly involved in issues relating to the treatment of quote white men, and the use of
2895160	2899720	identity politics in general. Now, I wouldn't describe any of his positions as hateful, or even
2899720	2904200	with the intent to do harm at this point. Sometimes I think he spoke from a point of genuine frustration
2904200	2908680	towards toxic factions in many movements who were advocating for otherwise righteous causes.
2908680	2914680	However, his frustration didn't subside in the year following, particularly with the online world further contorting.
2915480	2939240	But why should it matter to someone like Marcus Person? The dude wasn't the target of this,
2939240	2943320	and it's not like his freedom was being affected by it. Well at the start of 2017,
2943320	2947720	a few large YouTubers, most notably PewDiePie came under scrutiny for their behaviour online.
2947720	2951720	At the time, many who sympathised with these creators saw large corporations punching down
2951720	2955720	on the freedom of expression previously held by many creators, whether or not the humour was in
2955720	2960120	good taste. In particular, this sort of battle emerged all over the internet between traditional
2960120	2964120	standards and the sort of wild west approach that other parts of the online world possessed,
2964120	2968120	and how increasingly influential in modern culture they were becoming. The online world and their
2968120	2972600	communities were facing down reproval from many angles, especially from those who felt it excluded
2972600	2977080	and alienated marginalised groups who deserved a space as much as anyone else. This all then
2977080	2980920	reached into the video game industry, particularly given the aftermath of the gamergate, something
2980920	2984920	that Notch had previously stayed rather neutral on, but now seemed to feel quite strongly about.
2984920	2989400	This criticism of the current online culture was often advocated by progressively identifying
2989400	2994600	people, the SJWs per se, who were also vociferously anti-Trump. I think a fair few people who were
2994600	2999240	attached to that sort of wild west of the internet drew a correlation between Trump and a specific way
2999240	3003480	of online life, particularly that freedom of speech given how Trump was a pretty unfiltered
3003480	3008040	person to say it lightly. Well, with infinite time and money, I guess Notch had finally found
3008040	3010760	another struggle, but was this one worth fighting for?
3020760	3024600	Marcus Person had always held a sort of morbid curiosity for these sorts of areas,
3024600	3028680	discussing the often contentious 4chan in an early interview, he describes it as possibly
3028680	3033320	being one of the closest things we've got to a self-conscious virtual entity on the internet,
3033320	3037720	even referencing it in an old intro screen for the game. In many ways, that sort of independent
3037720	3041960	minded section of the internet was what put Minecraft on the map, and so it wasn't completely
3041960	3046520	beyond belief why he felt protective about it. I think in many ways, people like Notch saw these
3046520	3050360	establishment types coming in and trying to dictate their own standards that much of the
3050360	3054280	internet didn't perceive similarly. I think it's fair to say that although Notch's opinions on the
3054280	3058120	matters in the previous part weren't completely out of nowhere given his background, they were
3058120	3062280	somewhat different to many around him at the time, and it definitely alienated some people.
3062280	3066120	When someone asked him why it seemed like everyone hated him now, he replied they didn't hate him,
3066120	3069800	they agreed, but were just afraid to speak up, and as what he said received pushback,
3069800	3074600	he became more and more stubborn, and in turn more and more irrational. Even if he agreed with
3074600	3078680	any point he was making, it was lost in the sense that he was fighting a greater cultural battle.
3078680	3082920	When an incident occurred at VidCon involving Anita Sarkeesian clashing heads with her critics,
3082920	3087800	and Ant Green responding, he tagged Green telling him to be on the right side of history.
3087800	3091960	That's a strong term for a situation that related to a commentary spat at a panel. At the end of
3091960	3096600	Pride Month in 2017, there was a movement called Heterosexual Pride Day. Notch noticed this and
3096600	3100920	stated that if you didn't support it, you deserve to be shot. Eventually, he did retract this
3100920	3104920	statement and apologise, but it was clear that he was taking this all a little too seriously.
3104920	3108920	It was clear that this was a historic battle to person for the soul of society, and this seemed
3108920	3114200	to be influencing his political beliefs as well. In a May 2017 interview, then President Donald
3114200	3118280	Trump made the bold claim that he invented the phrase priming the pump, which is particularly
3118280	3122840	impressive given that in modern terms, it was first applied in the 1930s, the decade before
3122840	3127080	Trump was born. Mockery ensued, and many people took to their favourite social media site to take
3127080	3131800	the piss, including video game writer and YouTube critic Mikey Newman. Person after having the
3131800	3135960	reference explained to him makes the judgment that it is just more baseless Trump bashing because
3135960	3140120	they are afraid, which certainly prompted some confusion. It seemed that as the months passed,
3140120	3144360	Notch had become more preoccupied with his idea that every narrative against Trump was part of
3144360	3149160	some great conspiracy to prevent him from making America great again, and well, it's a bit far
3149160	3153560	fetched. The thing about a lot of conspiracy theories is that they do often start with one
3153560	3157960	genuine observation. Were certain echelons of the media disproportionately outraged with Trump's
3157960	3161960	presidency when they'd given others a pass? You could make an argument for it. You could say that
3161960	3166040	they weren't anywhere near as critical as previous presidencies when they enacted policy that could
3166040	3170200	significantly harm a population. However, the fallacious link comes when you conclude that
3170200	3173880	therefore they hate Trump because he's finally doing the right thing, rather than the fact that
3173880	3178120	he's unorthodox and generates views for financially focused businesses. There were plenty of people
3178120	3181800	online who were quite aware of establishment's shortcomings, but also felt like it was still
3181800	3185720	bad to point out issues regarding Trump. When he makes a claim that he invented a term that
3185720	3189800	existed before he was born, then yeah, I don't think it's unjustified to have a bit of a chuckle
3189800	3194360	about it. However, Notch didn't seem to be seeing it this way, and neither were a lot of Americans.
3194360	3198120	So with that in mind, let's talk about a little conspiracy theory that occurred the year before,
3198120	3202840	known as Pizzagate. Pizzagate was the allegation that there was an insidious, satanic underground
3202840	3207800	sex ring being operated by the Clintons and Democrats out of a Washington DC pizzeria. It was
3207800	3212440	rooted in an email link from a Clinton campaigner which theorists claimed contained a secret code
3212440	3216760	that tied all of this together, and eventually resulted in a gunman turning up to the pizzeria
3216760	3220840	and firing his rifle at the institution. There were deluge of other related incidents to the
3220840	3225000	theory which has widely been discredited by mainstream institutions, emphasis on the
3225000	3229160	mainstream institutions here. Now that's not to say it has credit, I personally don't think it does,
3229160	3232760	but when you believe a theory that dictates all authority figures are in on something,
3232760	3237880	them telling you it doesn't exist isn't going to be convincing enough. Pizzagate mostly fizzled out
3237880	3243480	after the 2016 election, particularly given that Donald Trump actually won, but in August 2017,
3243480	3247960	Notch published a tweet stating that in fact, Pizzagate was real. A bit late to the party,
3247960	3251560	all things considered, but quite the claim regardless. In elaborating on his stance,
3251560	3255560	he rants about binary politics, and how there might actually be pieces of evidence that have
3255560	3259880	supported this theory, but that it might also be drugs, though the pedestrians do look like people
3259880	3265400	in a police sketch, and the pizza place has weird art and branding, etc. There were already a lot of
3265400	3270200	retorts online to the claims made in Notch's very long thread, but he seems certain something is up,
3270200	3274200	and although people may perceive his thread as being a bit behind the current political discourse,
3274200	3278120	it may not have been as unprompted as some people thought. On the forums like 4chan,
3278120	3282440	this narrative had been brewing, but one that integrated a new perspective, that Donald Trump
3282440	3286840	was aware, and working to bring this worldwide satanic cabal down, and there would only be a
3286840	3291160	matter of time until many significant public figures were reprimanded and charged. Similar
3291160	3295400	versions of this story had already been promoted on the polls section of 4chan, but come October
3295400	3300200	this began to escalate. On the 27th of the aforementioned month, a user by the name of
3300200	3304760	QClarencePatriot claimed that Hillary Clinton was soon going to be arrested, and civil unrest
3304760	3308840	would follow. QClarence is a level of clearance used for the Department of Energy, it gives you
3308840	3312680	access to a variety of data that would otherwise be restricted to the public, the inference here
3312680	3316280	being that this guy was someone high up in government, and he was speaking out due to his
3316280	3320280	patriotic nature. This seemed to capture the imagination for many in the forum, and was
3320280	3324120	followed quickly by another post that seemed to incriminate other popular democratic figureheads
3324120	3327880	and donors, implying that there would soon be a large-scale reckoning for all those who Trump
3327960	3332040	viewed as criminal rogue elements. This would quickly manifest and grow, receiving more and
3332040	3336040	more media attention, and garnering a following from many committed Trump devotees. I think what
3336040	3340200	happens to many people is the feeling of a greater cause and explanation for Trump's actions. He had
3340200	3344120	always pledged to drain the swamp, and deliver justice to a system that legitimately been rigged
3344120	3348920	against so many people. Q himself occupied this position of unfalsifiability, whose content could
3348920	3353480	only be proven by time, and often leveraged on the belief of the individual, and it turned out that
3353480	3357640	many were actually quite prepared to believe. Although Notch was not necessarily directly
3357640	3361320	involved with anything QAnon related in its inception, and there's no direct evidence
3361320	3365000	tying him to that, the correlation between his interest in Pizzagate and the founding of this
3365000	3368840	sector of the internet seemed to imply that he was spending a bit too much time in these forums,
3368840	3372840	and as he became more and more outspoken, people began to take notice.
3384360	3387880	Make no mistake, Notch had definitely been pushing people's buttons online, but overall,
3387880	3391560	this hadn't affected his status related to his work at this point, likely because most of his
3391560	3395480	tweets didn't have much staying power online, and people didn't really care enough about some dude
3395480	3399960	shouting into the void. He held steadfast on most of his opinions, but up to the end of 2018,
3399960	3404120	he didn't seem to garner much attention outside the discourse sphere that he was involved in.
3404120	3407880	However, there was the occasional reference to Operation Mockingbird, a theory that refers to
3407880	3411800	the alleged brainwashing of the public through media propaganda, and had been regularly mentioned
3411800	3416760	by those on QAnon, and Q himself who mentions it in his original post. Although it never attracted
3416760	3421000	that much media attention, it was indicative of what he was doing with his time. However,
3421000	3424920	as Notch's takes grew increasingly strong, there was a sense that what he was saying couldn't be
3424920	3429480	ignored. This began in December 2018, which was met with a flurry of statements by person,
3429480	3433640	some relating to race, some relating to general political identity, and just some relating to
3433640	3437560	whatever the hell this is. He still presented himself as someone on the side of the little guy,
3437560	3441400	but it seems he had identified a greater battle against those who were at the top, and the far
3441400	3445880	left who were controlling every aspect of his life. If you were with them, you were ontologically
3445880	3449960	evil. There was no two ways about it. Now, these tweets were definitely more concerning than the
3449960	3453640	previous sets. The least you could say about his comments up to this point was that although they
3453640	3458120	were often provocative, the intended targets were often general concepts of political correctness,
3458120	3462840	SJWs, and establishment figures, all of which were not without their flaws, even if the obsession
3462840	3467000	with them was a bit overwrought on Notch's behalf. However, these tweets seem to harp on some other
3467000	3470600	more questionable theories, in particular relating to IQ differences between racial
3470600	3474840	populations. Now, this has been the subject of debate in certain scientific circles, with many
3474840	3479480	broadly on the side of the opinion that IQ is not affected by race, more due to other environmental
3479480	3483960	factors that may coincide with race. However, how does a human generated spectrum of intelligence
3483960	3488120	help discussion on racial differences? How would it dictate the world we live in? The truth is that
3488120	3493320	people are still individuals, and anyone from any race can be really smart or really stupid.
3493320	3497240	Notch had clearly grown to hate the general state of the gaming industry, as he felt it was dictated
3497240	3501400	by a small proportion of easily offended people. The left received a lot of the blame when companies
3501400	3504920	made decisions that others thought they were being pressured into, but many of them were decisions
3504920	3508520	ultimately made by the company. What would anyone who actually felt strongly about these matters
3508520	3512360	done if the businesses in this industry just turned around to them and said no we're not doing
3512360	3516360	that, or just ignored them? Probably not much, maybe some angry tweets, but that would be it.
3516360	3520040	And Notch has survived alright to this point. Despite the fact that he didn't have direct ties
3520040	3523880	to any companies, he was still symbolically associated with Minecraft and commemorated in
3523880	3528840	the game. However, come March 2019, Notch was once again ready to test that, and this time he was
3528840	3533240	going all out. First mentioning Operation Mockingbird again, but then dropping any innuendo
3533240	3537480	and just outwardly stating that Q was legit, and that we should not be trusting the media.
3537480	3541160	To be honest, I don't trust the media too much either, but for someone who doesn't like binary
3541160	3545400	politics, he sure likes to make binary choices. After a couple days of continuing to push these
3545400	3549320	general narratives that the populace was being lied to by the establishment, he takes it to it
3549320	3553240	to make the interesting observation that suddenly all the requests for him to stream and podcast
3553240	3557560	have stopped. How curious, I guess the establishment decided that his time was none,
3557560	3561720	but his Twitter was still growing, which is something I guess. I mean, he was making up to
3561720	3566360	100 tweets a day. With Notch fully embracing the QAnon movement and the man behind it,
3566360	3569960	he definitely raised a few eyebrows, with articles being published on his recent turn to
3569960	3574120	conspiracy theories. However, not finished to his crusade, he turns his attention to a variety of
3574120	3578040	matters, first drawing a comparison between dressing as another race and dressing as the
3578040	3581880	opposite gender, and saying there is no difference. This opinion didn't seem to attract
3581880	3585960	too much traffic, as it could be seen as referring to cross-dressing. However, not too long after,
3585960	3589560	Notch was back to business on a plethora of fronts, sometimes posting rather vaguely,
3589560	3593480	which attracted some QAnon responses, other times just cutting the chase and reminding
3593480	3597640	people that casual murdering of infants for organ harvesting purposes is not acceptable.
3597640	3602040	Hard agree on that one Notch. He then writes a thread seemingly going truth mode on society,
3602040	3605720	you cannot negotiate with these people who are trying to destroy human civilization as we know
3605720	3609560	it. At least that's what I take from the thread, though the last two tweets seemed more direct to
3609560	3613560	the trans community, mentioning gender dysphoria and pronouns, including the claim that trans
3613560	3617880	people are trying to make it illegal to use the wrong pronouns, even though actually it's them
3617880	3623000	who have the pronouns wrong. This began to receive some serious pushback, especially from some of his
3623000	3627080	trans followers who are particularly enthusiastic about Minecraft, with one sharing a pro-trans
3627080	3631640	message in a My Little Pony format stating that trans women are women. Notch didn't appreciate
3631640	3635560	that, and quote tweeted the person stating that they were wrong, and although trans women were
3635560	3640360	deserving of support as much as anyone else, that anyone advocating for this position was evil,
3640360	3646040	and feeding into a dangerous mentally ill delusion, using his sister's body dysmorphia as an example.
3646040	3649640	When further challenged on this, it seems he's more concerned about the authoritarian nature
3649640	3653720	of many people to quote demand that they be addressed by specific pronouns. He stands his
3653720	3657800	ground, states that it is illegal in many places already, and agree with another tweet that if they
3657800	3662120	do this unquestionably they will also be walking back women's rights, seemingly adopting a more
3662120	3666600	trans-exclusionary radical feminist standpoint. Now, I do not know the law in every country or
3666600	3670920	region, but the fact that Notch did not seem to cite any sources or even anecdotal content made
3670920	3674680	these claims rather hard to work with, and when being asked what this all was about he commented
3674680	3678600	the Great Awakening, which is another event commonly referenced on QAnon where the greater
3678600	3682120	population becomes aware of the truth, Notch seemed to be framing his tweets from the lens
3682120	3686600	that he was punching up against an oppressive regime, but many people didn't seem to agree.
3686600	3689800	Although it was true that certain industries were striving towards greater diversity,
3689800	3693880	many didn't think it was really at the request of any specific demographic. It was more just a
3693880	3697720	financially intelligent thing to do to give products greater appeal, as the number of people
3697720	3701960	in certain groups outnumbered the people who were annoyed by these groups' existence. As someone who
3701960	3706120	made a game whose whole existence can be defined by the individual, and as a person who emphasised
3706120	3710280	that in the past, this shouldn't be new information to Notch, but he came to the conclusion that this
3710280	3715240	time it was state mandated. However, in the end it just seemed like he was targeting a group of
3715240	3720680	people, whereas misinformation could be making targets out of them. It seemed that as time passed,
3720680	3722680	he was growing only more conspiratorial.
3729560	3733720	Throughout most of March, Notch continued to back its position unapologetically, responding in an
3733720	3737640	increasingly blasé manner to those who showed hostility to them, and if there was any doubt
3737640	3741240	about it you could just look at his bio, which contained a link to the website where Q would
3741240	3745640	regularly post. Safe to say, Notch was definitely testing the patience of those who didn't hold his
3745640	3750600	beliefs and still associated with him, most notably Munkraft itself. The person's recent
3750600	3754760	turn to conspiracy theories had almost locked him in a self-inflicted cycle. As he became more and
3754760	3758760	more extreme, fewer and fewer people felt truly comfortable with his ideas, and consequently
3758760	3763240	probably weren't as keen to entertain his presence. Notch observed this and embraced his alienation.
3763240	3767320	He's been an outcast before, and he was ready to be an outcast again, likely attributing part of the
3767320	3770840	reason to the fact that they couldn't handle him speaking the truth. Many of these people would
3770840	3775240	probably be in on it as well. In 2019 though, after the string of tweets we've just covered,
3775240	3780040	Microsoft began to decouple their casual, if still meaningful, relationship. It first began
3780040	3783720	with the simple removal of references to him in the loading screen. This seemed to be rather
3783720	3788120	insignificant on the surface, however up to this point it was extremely rare for any splash text
3788120	3793000	to be erased, only happening a handful of times in Minecraft's lifespan. At the time, many suspected
3793000	3797240	this to be related to the incidents analysed in the previous part, however Microsoft refused to
3797240	3800920	comment on the matter, and ultimately this was deemed rather trivial. However, there was another
3800920	3804920	event round the corner that would test Microsoft's position on the matter, that being the 10th
3804920	3809880	anniversary of Minecraft's publication to the internet. It made sense that Notch wasn't involved
3809880	3814040	with the public image of Minecraft as it was, but at the end of the day, without him, Minecraft
3814040	3818120	wouldn't exist, and the 10th anniversary was a celebration of just that. By not commenting on the
3818120	3821880	removal of the splash text that credits him, Microsoft had the choice open so they wouldn't
3821880	3825880	seem hypocritical if they did invite him, however barely a month after it seems they had made
3825880	3829880	a decision that he would not be included in the landmark festival for all things Minecraft,
3829880	3833800	with the spokesperson telling the press, his comments and opinions do not reflect those of
3833800	3838440	Microsoft or Mojang and are not representative of Minecraft. Notch didn't seem to make any public
3838440	3842840	comment himself, he moved on to playing the game Factorio, he seemed to be having fun with it at
3842840	3847000	least. In the run up to the event he made a couple vague posts here and there which were hard to
3847000	3851240	interpret, but on the day of the anniversary he put out a single tweet reading, Happy Birthday,
3851880	3856840	smiley face. It reached almost 30,000 likes, which is far more than any of his previous argumentative
3856840	3859880	tweets had reached, and in these moments of wholesomeness you almost forget what he was
3859880	3864280	tweeting barely a couple months before. In a way, Minecraft's decision was probably in the best
3864280	3868040	interests of everyone, if Notch still held his beliefs pretty ardently at this point, I'm sure
3868040	3871960	he probably saw his exclusion as a badge of honour above anything else. If you believe in that sort
3871960	3876680	of satanic cabal, Microsoft is definitely a part of it, however I think Notch likely had a different
3876680	3880600	viewpoint that could be illuminated by a few tweets. Although not commenting on his exclusion
3880600	3884360	from the anniversary event, Notch did briefly comment on Microsoft removing the in-game
3884360	3888680	references to him. After expressing regret for something assumedly relating to his position on
3888680	3893000	trans people, he responds to a comment to someone saying that Minecraft removing references to him
3893000	3897560	may be a way to help him process what he had been saying and doing. This comment seems to demonstrate
3897560	3901720	some contrition for his recent antics, and seemingly accepts his fate for whatever happens
3901720	3906760	next. People had additionally started a movement to recognise Hatsune Miku as the creator of
3906760	3911320	Minecraft, and Notch appeared to take it on the chin, stating that letting go is key. It's hard to
3911320	3915720	retell where Notch stood on his comments, as he neither issued a formal retraction, or reassertion
3915720	3919560	following them. He seemed to regret how he'd phrased it himself, and that he had hurt people,
3919560	3924040	but didn't elaborate on whether he stood by his opinions. Regardless, he seemed to accept that
3924040	3929080	where he was, and where Minecraft was, were not the same place, and for that much, he was right,
3929080	3933400	they weren't. Over the following year, he mostly refrained from talking politics directly,
3933400	3937320	the occasional comment about Trump or Hillary, but ones that were not too hard to read into.
3937320	3941160	I honestly find a fair few of his tweets hard to completely understand sometimes, and his use of
3941160	3945080	the word evil seems to have lost its meaning, to be honest. There was a hoax that he had passed away
3945080	3949000	from a drug overdose, which was obviously not true, I think it once again likely arose from
3949000	3953240	someone who was probably not a fan, but it was quickly debunked given that Notch was still firing
3953240	3957080	off tweets every other hour. Although it was safe to say that Notch had been less provocative than
3957080	3960840	he had been, he was still quite loud with his opinions when he chose to be, he still gave off
3960840	3964600	the energy of one of those people who says they're not being political, but they clearly
3964600	3970120	are at points. In August of 2020, a YouTuber by the name of Game Maker's Toolkit decided to try
3970120	3973880	and run some ads on their channel. They posted their conclusion on their twitter and referenced
3973880	3978520	certain re-election ads from Mr Trump. Notch, seemingly displeased with this comment, requested
3978520	3983720	them to drop the politics, which GMTK said they would if Notch in return deleted his twitter
3983720	3989000	account. Surprisingly, the person decided to agree. GMTK took down their tweet, and Notch took
3989000	3993640	down his account, taking the world back to the blissful days before people cared about who their
3993640	3997880	president was and that crap. Except a few days later Notch came back, explained that he was worried
3997880	4002280	someone would claim his name tag so had to do it for security reasons, and at that point just felt
4002280	4006840	he had to start tweeting anyway, which doesn't make much sense, but his return to twitter couldn't be
4006840	4011400	a surprise. I think it's fair to observe the fact that although many tweets covered in the last
4011400	4015480	couple parts obviously did generate controversy amongst communities, they didn't really attract
4015480	4019640	too much attention from those outside the immediate sphere. A few articles and responses,
4019640	4024200	but otherwise it was pretty quiet. You have to be an avid follower of the industry to notice.
4024200	4028280	Notch never really farmed the attention that he was receiving, when most celebrities go rogue they
4028280	4032520	at least take an interview slot on Tucker Carson or something. Notch never seemed to sacrifice his
4032520	4037160	hatred of public life for publicity of his opinions, amongst many he was still that guy who
4037160	4041160	made the game that their kids play, and they still heralded him from the era that had him as one of
4041160	4045400	the most powerful people in the world. It's likely why Microsoft was so hesitant to drop him,
4045400	4049480	but eventually they realised that their name attached to an article could yield a bit more
4049480	4054760	cares, especially if Notch said something ill timed at the event, prospectively poisoning sales.
4054760	4058920	Ultimately the benefits of hosting someone like Notch, who had no technical connection to Minecraft
4058920	4065320	in its then present form, did not outweigh the drawbacks, and thus the disconnect was complete.
4065320	4066520	But what was left behind?
4070760	4074600	Now you're mostly up to date, the year is whatever it is right now, who bloody knows,
4074600	4079640	and Notch has mostly faded into the ether, which given the current escalating political climate
4079640	4084280	is probably for the best. As said, many do likely not know about all the antics over the previous
4084280	4088440	years, some probably hate him for it, a few probably think he's based, but I wonder how he
4088440	4093640	feels after all. The person who was previously so open about his feelings has become quite quiet,
4093640	4097720	his twitter mostly observations now, with the occasional tweet of affection to those still
4097720	4102440	there. You can't help but wonder when looking back at his career if he thinks it was all worth it.
4102440	4106840	Person occupies this strange position of having so much, yet having so little. With a money and
4106840	4111160	lack of commitment he really had to anyone or anything, he became this social media drifter,
4111160	4115320	just kinda coasting from one topic to the next without any real continuity, free to speak his
4115320	4120440	mind without proper material consequence, emphasis on material. Meanwhile though, the spoils of being
4120440	4124680	a popular figure had dried up as soon as he'd ventured down the conspiratorial path. Although
4124680	4128200	Microsoft were the only people to officially cut ties with him, there were likely many other
4128200	4132360	opportunities that didn't present themselves due to these comments. Companies, conventions,
4132360	4136200	associates would likely see him as a liability, and where some people might actually care about
4136200	4139960	their reputation with Microsoft ending their association with him, Notch just seemed to
4139960	4144200	accept that he had made his bet, but acceptance doesn't equate to happiness. I think a lot of
4144200	4148600	people felt a sort of confusion as to what exactly led us to this scenario, and to be honest it is
4148600	4152840	understandable. The first thing when analysing a person's behaviour is often to search for motive,
4152840	4157240	to find some discernible cause, and a cursory look at Notch's background and existence wouldn't really
4157240	4160360	point to anything that would lead to such behaviour, particularly given that most people
4160360	4164920	knew him from Minecraft, and what it represented to them. Throughout much of his lifespan,
4164920	4169080	Minecraft garnered a significant audience who didn't necessarily fit into traditional societal
4169080	4173080	norms, and that wasn't necessarily a surprise given that the guy who created it also didn't
4173080	4176920	when he was growing up. Loads of people played Minecraft, likely many with extremely diverse
4176920	4180760	backgrounds and political views, and it never possessed a specific identity per se,
4180760	4184760	but over the years it garnered a reputation as probably the most inclusive and accessible games
4184760	4188440	of modern history. Probably a good example of this is how it benefited the social skills of
4188440	4192520	many who have lacked them otherwise. Minecraft has been shown to really aid children who experience
4192520	4196520	certain neurodevelopmental conditions such as autism, with many parents singing their praises
4196520	4200600	of the game's transformative effect for their loved ones, finding a community and escape that
4200600	4204680	actually helps them be more comfortable in their own skin. In the last few decades society has
4204680	4208440	become increasingly aware and sensitive to those who encounter such conditions, and the social
4208440	4211960	challenges that they may have to traverse as a result of it. While many regular social
4211960	4215800	environments were still learning to evolve to the needs of those who may or may not thrive in those
4215800	4219800	places, Minecraft was already there, and I don't think that was restricted to any specific
4219800	4223960	demographic. I think it's also applied to many marginalised LGBT individuals, particularly those
4223960	4228280	in the trans community who found solacing a game where your entire life is essentially customisable.
4228280	4231960	It's not just an escape from the real world, it's the entrance to a completely different one.
4231960	4236120	We discussed how a game can often represent its creator, and Minecraft represented a place that
4236120	4240040	remedied people who experienced the often isolating life growing up that Notch did.
4240040	4244040	That's a principle that doesn't end on the basis of personal identity, and therefore if anyone was
4244040	4247960	going to understand the contemporary struggle of marginalised groups to fit in with society,
4247960	4251720	it should have been him right? Even if you believe that there wasn't any relationship between the
4251720	4255640	creator and his game, even if perhaps people projected too much of the game onto the creator,
4255640	4259160	it wasn't like Notch was ever vocal about any views that would contradict this image.
4259160	4262280	On the contrary, in fact, as I've already documented, the dude announced that every
4262280	4265720	character is genderless, and even facetiously claimed that that made them all gay,
4265720	4270120	thus owning the homophobes. He didn't seem to have much respect for traditional gamer toxicity,
4270120	4274520	criticising tropes such as calling someone gay as weird attempts at insults, and said that although
4274520	4278840	he hadn't been attracted to a man, he tried to keep an open mind, and he's pretty cuddly.
4278840	4282680	After he was informed that a Kickstarter he'd promoted was started by someone who
4282680	4287400	seemingly helped homophobic views, he expressed disappointment, and said people should be sane.
4287480	4291240	At a time where video game companies often stayed out of debates surrounding political issues,
4291240	4295720	Notch's opinions on issues affecting marginalised communities always felt authentic. These days,
4295720	4299240	it's often hard to tell which companies are actually interested in advancing the rights
4299240	4302840	of those they claim to care about, and those who are just playing to the crowd as they always have.
4302840	4306680	You could probably say that disingenuous support is better than none at all, but sometimes you also
4306680	4310200	want to know who's not going to throw your rights under the bus when it's no longer profitable to
4310200	4314120	them. Notch seemed like that guy, people might claim he was just being politically correct back
4314120	4318200	when he had an audience to commit to, but I'd say all evidence suggests otherwise. As a guy
4318200	4322360	whose success wasn't concerned by PR or even dependent on the game's sales, Notch was free
4322360	4326280	to take whatever positions that he wished to, and he did take many in a time where they weren't
4326280	4330680	necessarily widespread. His views on issues like piracy and big tech were considered different
4330680	4334760	for their time in that industry, particularly when it was out of step with big tech itself.
4334760	4338520	He was the anti-establishment figure whose success inadvertently tore up the status quo.
4338520	4342440	The establishment's position on such matters has always been to predominantly follow popular
4342440	4346680	opinion or play to the largest present market. Notch was never like that, and his game didn't
4346680	4350760	conform to those boundaries either which is what made it such a success. I'm sure for many people
4350760	4354680	who didn't identify with the traditional brand of gamer, Minecraft was their introduction to
4354680	4358680	video games as a whole. I think that's what made his outburst on the matter of transgender rights
4358680	4362360	the breaking point for corporate relations. Despite the numerous concerning statements
4362360	4366440	prior, Notch had created this game based on principles that he seemed to advocate for
4366440	4370360	before brutally turning on. It's not out of the question for people to change their opinions that
4370360	4374360	much is true, but this just didn't make sense with what he'd created before. I don't think
4374360	4377880	anyone ever saw these tweets as a grift, he didn't have anything to gain from his actions,
4377880	4381400	and didn't seem to want to gain anything from them. On the other hand, looking at the evidence,
4381400	4385080	I don't think you can say he was being dishonest or corporate with his views before, I don't think
4385080	4389960	selling his share in Minecraft necessarily freed his opinions anymore, but how can we reconcile
4389960	4394520	two parts of an individual's life that seem so contradictory? Maybe we need to get into his shoes
4394520	4410680	a little more. When analysing two apparently contradictory patterns of thoughtful behaviour,
4410680	4414280	sometimes it's important to look at the wider picture and causes, and how they may have
4414280	4418040	interacted with each other. With Notch, I think the clues to understanding his about-turn in
4418040	4422120	political positions can be defined by a few constants and variables that impacted his
4422120	4425800	previously rather innocent worldview. So let's talk about some of these factors.
4425800	4429720	The most important factor is that of community. I think if there's one thing that matters to Notch,
4429720	4433640	it's community. It's a complicated aspect of video game creation that he wrangled with for
4433640	4437480	much of his career, but although he wasn't always a media darling, and often definitely took pride
4437480	4441080	in having some sort of control in the direction of his projects, he definitely valued the input
4441080	4445240	from those around him, particularly those who actually sampled his output. This began the
4445240	4449160	community of indie developers, some of whom he would go on to work with in creating Minecraft.
4449160	4452840	He would regularly post his projects and interact with other developments, providing feedback and
4452840	4457160	accepting it for his own works. It's not a surprise that in spite of the game's traction outside the
4457160	4461320	forums, the person remained active there on his account until the end of 2010, continuing to
4461320	4465480	discuss Minecraft and general gaming matters with other budding developers. This was a similar
4465480	4468840	pattern with his audience, although it was difficult to necessarily orchestrate a close
4468840	4473080	relationship with your user base, Notch did his best, using a combination of Twitter and Tumblr
4473080	4477240	to provide a balance between informal expressions of personal opinion and official announcements.
4477240	4481240	He enjoyed attending conferences and interacting with fans, being a part of something so much
4481240	4486040	greater gave him a sense of purpose. Person also reaped the benefits of a tight-knit workforce in
4486040	4489960	the company that he founded, maintaining the total number of staff under 50 during his tenure at the
4489960	4494440	business. Notch reportedly held a strong personal camaraderie with his employees. Mojang's office
4494440	4498280	was based on the design of a regular home, and filled to the brim with amenities. Workers would
4498280	4502520	be treated to lucrative bonuses, and company trips involving the entire workforce would be made to
4502520	4507000	luxurious spots to celebrate the game's continued prosperity. Community mattered to Minecraft,
4507000	4511000	as a grassroots game with no investors, it was what kept the game untethered and unimpeded by
4511000	4514920	ulterior interests, and if it mattered to Minecraft, it mattered to Marcus. I think the
4514920	4519080	enjoyment of community resulted from the fact that Notch assumed the role of a working-class
4519080	4522840	hero of sorts, a lot of people from this sort of background could have easily let the spoils of
4522840	4526600	stardust come to them, it almost had the opposite effect on Person, who seemed determined to
4526600	4531720	demonstrate his allegiance to the everyday gamer. It should be no secret, Notch liked to be liked.
4532280	4535960	I don't think this core set of beliefs ever deserted him, however as the circumstances
4535960	4540520	surrounding his popularity evolved, his position and that of others influenced his perspectives
4540520	4545160	on said communities. As his fanbase grew, his activity on the developer's forum quietened down,
4545160	4549000	the increase in gulf between him and those who enjoyed the game also expanded. In spite of the
4549000	4553400	claims he was acting the user's best interests, the situation regarding in-game transactions
4553400	4557480	ultimately broke him because people alleged he was prioritising corporate interests,
4557480	4561080	something that clearly upset him so much that he decided to sell his shares.
4561080	4565160	Think about it for a moment, one of the most successful figures in the video game industry
4565160	4569640	sold the shares to his company because he was upset at what people online were saying.
4569640	4573560	This may have solved one issue, but it opened up another after many of its staff seemed dissatisfied
4573560	4577960	with the outcome of the deal. This was a guy who had turned down any and all investors up until
4577960	4581960	this point, and although he did secure protections and bonuses for many of his employees, the
4581960	4586360	principal of going with something he'd previously opposed, ferociously too seemed to hurt them.
4586360	4590200	In many ways he gained a lot, but he'd lost what mattered to him for so long, and with the
4590200	4593880	increased distance between him and the surrounding world, he gradually grew more listless and
4593880	4598440	languid. Eventually he was left with no community, nobody to properly identify with, and it wasn't
4598440	4601800	like the wealth was the inherent root of the problem, but it was the result of decisions
4601800	4605720	that inevitably isolated him from a lot of people. He wanted to rid himself of the crippling
4605720	4610120	responsibilities that had come with being part of these communities, but had nothing to fill it with
4610120	4613480	until the internet began to move in a different direction, a more political one.
4614440	4616520	Like that's ever gonna happen.
4616520	4620680	Politics is something that many people understandably avoid, but it's also something that many people
4620680	4624360	can be sucked into, particularly if they have nothing better to do than firing up the old blue
4624360	4628200	bird and picking the first hot take that rubs others the wrong way. Not to have been outspoken
4628200	4632120	on many of his political opinions, but never seem to attach too much meaning to it personally,
4632120	4637240	but as a perpetually bored person looking for a cause to latch onto, what happened in 2016 was the
4637240	4641080	perfect catalyst. The campaign and subsequent election of Donald Trump, and the reaction from
4641160	4645080	mainstream sources to much of his behaviour sparked a backlash amongst many on the internet,
4645080	4649240	not necessarily because people identified with him particularly, to be frank he wasn't very
4649240	4653240	related, but because they saw him as a sort of symbol in an enduring culture war against people
4653240	4657480	who wished to restrict online freedoms that had long been enjoyed by those who had used it.
4657480	4661480	Trump hated the establishment, big tech, and many of the organisations that Notch had rallied
4661480	4665560	against in the past, even though I'd say Trump had very different gripes to someone like Notch,
4665560	4669880	as an influential person his cause was enough, and in a way it was the resistance that provoked
4669880	4691160	people. It's also important to note that a lot of mainstream businesses that had long been
4691160	4695080	apolitical in many ways became outspoken on certain social issues that Trump was thought
4695080	4699080	to possibly hold power over, particularly given their increasing prominence on social media,
4699080	4702680	and the new generation using it who were somewhat more progressive in their viewpoints.
4702680	4706600	I think this sort of corporate movement probably alarmed someone like Notch, as to him they always
4706600	4711320	seem like the bellwether of cynical self-serving opinions, and sometimes the enemy of your enemy
4711320	4715800	is your friend. This is what started it at least, although he had mostly avoided taking positions
4715800	4720040	in past controversies and even larger scale situations, something about defending internet
4720040	4724360	culture seemed to galvanise him, as that guy who essentially had his career launched by the online
4724360	4728680	world, he was obviously going to be defensive of his characteristics that enabled his success.
4728680	4733080	After selling his shares he had lost his cause and community, but a new one was emerging,
4733080	4737560	one where he was part of the last line against a culture that could sterilise everything that made
4737560	4743000	it great. However, that still doesn't fully explain how we go from this, to this. There's
4743000	4747000	still a degree of disconnect, well, it wasn't a solo effort.
4747000	4756840	Intro
4756840	4761000	To understand the final stage of Notch's rabbit hole of conspiratorial behaviour, you have to
4761000	4765240	understand the conspiracies behind it, and how they took their grasp on corners of the internet.
4765240	4769880	The American political world was certainly being shaken up in 2016, and it's not hard to understand
4769880	4774200	why. Many people have made the valid observation there was a huge gulf between those in government,
4774200	4778120	the media, large corporations, and practically everyone else. Many Americans saw their lives
4778120	4782280	going nowhere, and they wanted something that could give them a purpose. I already spoke about
4782280	4785880	the connection between hating the establishment and loving someone like Trump, but the Forum of
4785880	4790600	QAnon took that idea one step further, and vied this elaborate explanation for everything occurring,
4790600	4794920	rooted in this idea that Donald Trump was the person to overhaul the broken system as we know it,
4794920	4799800	and bring the power abusing elite to justice. It took off because it targeted a certain demographic
4799800	4804040	of Americans who felt taken for granted by those in charge, it provided an explanation that played
4804040	4808200	into that moral black and white sort of thinking, presented people with a clear villain, a hero,
4808200	4812360	and a purpose to actually support. Person wasn't like many people part of this movement though,
4812360	4816600	firstly he wasn't American, he spent a fair amount of time there, but if everything did go to the
4816600	4821160	dogs he could easily just go back to his cushy residence in Stockholm. Person also wasn't someone
4821160	4825080	who was disenfranchised at that point, he lived a life of relative privilege, of course it was
4825080	4829160	roots from his own product, but it wasn't like he had anything to resent about his current lifestyle
4829160	4833320	at its core. At some points in conversation he had mentioned the financial aspects of American
4833320	4837160	politics which may lead some people to thinking he had ulterior motives, however he didn't have
4837160	4841080	any business interest in grifting because he'd sold them all, and these opinions probably cost
4841080	4845000	him a lot more in actual opportunities. Even many of those on the right avoided the realms
4845000	4849400	of QAnon because of how it was based mostly in speculation, for many people such a site was the
4849400	4853320	most unattractive setting of ideas to subscribe to. There's little doubt that Notch's tweets were
4853320	4857960	not designed to reap the words of those agreed with him, so what was it? First let's talk about
4857960	4861560	the sense of purpose that appealed to someone like Notch, who had clearly been understimulated
4861560	4865320	for too long by the world around him. We already knew that he had sympathies towards Trump in life
4865320	4869320	the position he occupied in much of the media, and the culture war that was occurring online.
4869320	4873480	QAnon elevated this idea of a culture war to fantastical levels, and made everyone who was
4873480	4877640	a part of it feel like a soldier for a cause that underscored the fabric of society. To many
4877640	4882040	outsiders it seemed so dangerously far-fetched, that's what made it exciting in the eyes of those
4882040	4886040	who were actually there. It could easily be the plot to a dystopian video game where you're the
4886040	4890120	resistance against a worldwide cannibalistic cabal. There are plenty of conspiracy theories
4890120	4894520	online, but this one had a plot and a finale, one where everyone who stood with the people against
4894520	4899000	the powers would be rewarded. Although it's just my perspective, I think Notch emotionally connected
4899000	4903560	with that, we're already aware of how seriously he took these issues. There is one more aspect
4903560	4906920	about a lot of these radical causes that often brings people together though, and that is the
4906920	4911000	absence of judgement between many people involved in these movements. Notch had clearly struggled to
4911000	4915080	find community after selling his share in Mojang, particularly given that he was a paranoid person
4915080	4919000	and didn't trust many in his own life, especially now that there could be superficial motives to
4919000	4922760	befriending him. He seemed to genuinely believe that most of the high society that he was part of
4922760	4927080	was corrupt and self-serving, sometimes seeming to long for more organic connections. I think the
4927080	4930520	problem with the real world is that when you become such a well-known figure your reputation
4930520	4933720	precedes you, and you don't get the chance to make first impressions because they've already
4933720	4938520	been made through publicity and media. By existing in online, often anonymous spaces, Notch probably
4938520	4943480	rediscovered a sense of community that transcended his existence outside of those real-world circles.
4943480	4947320	Notch enjoyed the forums of 4chan because he believed that it was people at their most honest
4947320	4951000	and unfiltered, but also a lot of what united people was just the fact that they could be
4951000	4955240	themselves. QAnon was more than that though, as a cause that provided an unquestioning community
4955240	4960360	for all those who united under its banner, a real us versus them, something where who you were came
4960360	4965080	secondary to everything else, and to hell to those who doubted you. For a lot of people this becomes
4965080	4969320	a very damaging cycle though, because the more divisive a conspiracy theory, the more it might
4969320	4973720	actually affect personal interactions. A lot of people believed if you followed QAnon then you
4973720	4977080	were just too delusional to even have a conversation with, so you could be distanced
4977080	4981240	from people completely and left with like-minded people who may not be the most beneficial to your
4981240	4986360	well-being. The other problem is that QAnon possessed what I would call explicable dissonance,
4986360	4990760	a concept common to a lot of conspiracy theories that provides an explanation for why outsiders
4990760	4995080	may expound otherwise logical reputations of the core doctrine in question. These sorts of
4995080	5000360	dismissals assign ignorance, brainwashing, and the very common idea that all will be revealed soon
5000360	5004840	to discredit critiques of QAnon's proposed dogma. People have turned their nose up at it, but it's
5004840	5010200	a powerful logical bind, albeit fallacious. QAnon did appeal to many disenfranchised people,
5010200	5013880	but it also appealed to individuals who were starved of some form of purpose in life or
5013880	5018520	community, things that every person really needs to feel emotionally fulfilled. A lot of old Q's
5018520	5022360	predictions ended up not occurring, and at any point these could be signalled to bring the
5022360	5026280	credibility of such a figure into question, but the truth was the cause was greater than
5026280	5031160	even the verity of any individual claim. Ideology came before anything else, even sometimes the
5031160	5035560	lives and well-being of those who were actually part of the movement, some would rather be a martyr
5035560	5039880	for the cause. These communities also became very insular, when you surround yourself with people
5039880	5044440	who only see things one way, you're very susceptible to succumbing to those perspectives, even if
5044440	5049000	otherwise in a normal environment you would dismiss them. Although Notch did not express his support
5049000	5053480	for the movement until 2019, the fact that he was promoting Pizzagate theories barely a few months
5053480	5057640	before QAnon was founded shows the sort of places that he was frequenting, but I think more
5057640	5062360	indicative was how he went about it. In his tweets, Person didn't seem to have a clear thought process
5062360	5067240	behind exactly why these things were legit, he regularly appeared to contradict himself and seemed
5067240	5072120	panicked and confused, even manic to a degree. Notch always saw himself as a man of the people,
5072120	5076440	a guy who was fighting against the establishment, and in a way QAnon presented itself as that too.
5076440	5080680	That was the entry point, but once you're in you're introduced to a lot of new ideas that build onto
5080680	5083640	each other, and eventually you're hooked on something greater than that and you're in a bubble
5083640	5087640	where you won't even listen to anything else outside of it. It's a chain reaction to what those
5087640	5092200	Florida tweets could easily be the result of, and in many cases was honestly one of the milder
5092200	5097320	results. The moral gravitas placed onto QAnon theories makes that fantasy very very real for
5097320	5102280	some people, and it has led to tragedy in multiple instances, with a subreddit even dedicated to
5102280	5106760	people whose friends and family members have been drawn in by those beliefs, many accounts describing
5106760	5111480	them as previously perfectly reasonable individuals. What many saw as a public outburst
5111480	5115480	in Notch's tweets was something that had long been building up behind the scenes, a product of
5115480	5120440	under-stimulation, wealth-induced paranoia, and existential emptiness, and ironically the desire
5120440	5123880	to be on the right side of history. But what will history say about him now?
5131640	5135400	At the start of the video, I invoked JK Rowling when talking about people who have become
5135400	5139880	controversial through their social media presence, however the one thing I would say about JK Rowling
5139880	5144920	is that she does have conviction with her beliefs, even if I believe they're wrong. For someone like
5144920	5153080	Notch, I feel there's a more relevant and recent example. This is Kanye West, a rapper and producer
5153080	5157480	whose music has been widely acclaimed for nearly two decades. His outspoken nature on political
5157480	5161560	issues garnered him a reputation for sure, but one that still commanded a level of respect for
5161560	5165320	its independence. However, that good faith offered to him has ultimately been put under
5165320	5169000	great strain in the wake of a plethora of anti-Semitic comments that do not even seek
5169000	5182920	to disguise the dangerous connotations. Similarly with Notch, it was hard to work out exactly what
5182920	5187160	motivated Ye's sudden spiral into such unabashed backing of extreme beliefs, to the point where
5187160	5191000	some even question whether it was an intentional move to tank his career. Although I wouldn't go
5191000	5195160	that far, I would say that a life where you have an abundance of resources but a lack of healthy
5195160	5199640	relationships can cause one to lash out in a way that antagonises those around you. There are many
5199640	5203720	ways of doing this, but turning to extreme beliefs is definitely one of them. It's an appeal to make
5203720	5208200	yourself as ugly as possible, challenge people to disown you, turn public opinion against you,
5208200	5213080	to change that superficiality. Both Kanye and Notch subscribed to beliefs that advocated this idea
5213080	5216760	that some elite class were fundamentally working against the interests of the people, and as
5216760	5220680	individuals who believed they were on the side of the underdog, what might seem like public meltdowns
5220680	5225400	to others seem like acts of personal and public resistance to them. It's a dangerous technique
5225400	5229400	though because you could easily just convert people to extreme beliefs, but sometimes people
5229400	5233080	don't think about that, especially when they feel like everything's already been said and done,
5233080	5237720	you feel like there's nothing else worthwhile left. We spoke about legacy, how one wishes to
5237720	5242200	be remembered after they're gone. It's a complicated conversation, because as much as the thought of
5242200	5246760	being revered by some around you may be alluring, you don't really have the privilege of living that
5246760	5251320	legacy. If you live your life for a legacy then you're not really doing it on your own terms,
5251320	5255800	for an artist sometimes it's about pursuing a personal vision first, even if those around you
5255800	5260440	don't necessarily approve. Notch's story isn't like that of many artists though, he's one of the
5260440	5265400	few people who has actually seen his legacy play out while he was still alive. Even public figures
5265400	5269080	who have been in broad in far more serious controversies seem to have some control over
5269080	5273560	the direction of their image, yet to many the conclusion for someone like Marcus Person had
5273560	5277320	already been written when he moved on from Minecraft. I'd argue there are many who still
5277320	5281160	probably have their thoughts dictated on the guy more from their opinion of his most famous
5281160	5285320	video game above anything else, despite the fact that he hasn't worked on it for a decade.
5285320	5289400	I think Notch was quietly aware of this, when being asked about his legacy he seemed to show
5289400	5293320	disregard for the idea, and although I'm not entirely sure I buy his dismissive attitude,
5293320	5297320	we'll get to that in a bit, I think he had to emotionally disconnect from it to an extent,
5297320	5301480	or else he would have been a relic in his own mind. There was no way to properly follow up a
5301480	5306360	game like Minecraft, a game so built on grassroots appeal, by the time that Notch acquired wealth and
5306360	5311000	fame he could never naturally replicate something so organic unless he created a whole new anonymous
5311000	5315640	persona, crafting a magnum opus of such a scale at such a young age with nothing else publicly
5315640	5320520	notable under his belt, becoming a personality so intertwined with that work, when he walked away it
5320520	5325480	was a death of some sorts. The nature of what he did, essentially opting out of his career with
5325480	5329400	such final effect, giving him no commitment to anything and a massive paycheck that allowed him
5329400	5333480	to switch his life to sandbox mode. If life was a video game then Notch reached the end credits
5333480	5334920	before he even turned 40.
5334920	5339480	Notch- Right now I'm just, you know, buying houses in LA and partying.
5339480	5343160	But the thing about the sandbox is that it does grow tiresome, having everything at the tip of
5343160	5346920	your fingers can often do more harm than good, particularly when you're not a person who ever
5346920	5351480	really had a strong connection to the reward of the process. Notch wanted to fulfil this idea of
5351480	5355720	being a rich person, the next stage of his life, the way he spoke about it sometimes made it seem
5355800	5360200	like its own occupation, but the truth is that it's not a job, and the only perceptual upsides
5360200	5364360	of becoming a socialite was the public attention, something that person was vocal about not
5364360	5369560	necessarily enjoying. He wanted to be a part of something, but not the centre of it. In the end,
5369560	5373560	his prosperity merely made him even more distant and bitter than his work already left him,
5373560	5377400	occasionally externalising that angst online, and in spite of some people offering their support
5377400	5381720	or assistance, Big Snoop even offering a trip to the doggy den, eventually the new lifestyle
5381720	5386200	wore out its welcome. Notch was an individual who cared about that community and that vision,
5386200	5390760	but by the time the next cause to commit to came around, all he had was a fucked-up cache and some
5390760	5395160	social media presence. That sandbox began to transform into a straightjacket, a naturally
5395160	5399240	paranoid and unsettled person, he seemed to find new purpose in being outspoken and politically
5399240	5403000	inclined, but gradually it grew into a set of beliefs much more antithetical to the world he
5403000	5407720	had previously created, who knows how long it was ultimately brewing. His tweets were a momentous
5407720	5412200	climax in their own regard, but almost as soon as he expounded the theories that drew the greatest
5412200	5417160	response he dropped them, never really addressing it, just kind of moving on. As is with the idea
5417160	5421560	with sacrificing your own public image, maybe Notch got what he wanted, the detachment from
5421560	5425560	the fear that his relationships were transactional, the ones who'll stick around in that scenario are
5425560	5429800	the ones who genuinely care about your well being. Unlike Kanye, he didn't seem to make any new
5429800	5433800	friends from his outburst nor did he end up on the Alex Jones show, but it still wasn't without
5433880	5438680	its bruising. Ultimately, it's not really rid him of the title of the creator of Minecraft,
5438680	5443080	just the title of the creator of Minecraft who then became a conspiracy theorist and racist,
5443080	5447560	and a fair few other isths. Although I'm sure he sleeps okay on whatever mattress a couple billion
5447560	5452200	can allow you to afford, there's still a lingering sadness that the outcome of years of hard work
5452200	5457080	was a name that many would rather forget, but still struggle to, and the bittersweet connotations
5457080	5462520	that come with the mention of it. He became a man both known for his best and worst moments,
5462520	5467160	and neither seemed to cancel each other out in people's minds. So what now?
5475080	5478920	I said Notch's Twitter has been pretty inoffensive over the past couple years,
5478920	5483720	which is largely true, but recently the original composer for the Minecraft soundtrack C418 decided
5483720	5488840	to put out a tweet expressing support for BLM and trans people, in light of a perceived rise in hate
5488840	5494280	speech. Notch in return decides to sarcastically reply, there we go, that should fix it, not
5494280	5499000	actively opposing the statement, but more snidely highlighting the futility of such a sentiment.
5499000	5503160	And maybe he's not wrong, maybe a tweet won't largely make a difference, but you'd think that
5503160	5507640	the creator of Minecraft would be the first person to understand that great oaks can grow from small
5507640	5512120	acorns, and even if only one person's life is changed for the better from it, it's still better
5512120	5516600	than no change at all. Unfortunately though, I think it reflects the rather nihilistic worldview
5516600	5521320	that Notch has adopted in the past few years, one that didn't seem present before. I probably
5521320	5525320	understand more than most that it's easy to catch yourself in that train of thought, but for a man
5525320	5529480	who's always seemed concerned about how to change people's lives for the better, he doesn't seem to
5529480	5534920	know what's best for himself. If he did, I doubt we'd be here discussing it today. Notch's behaviour
5534920	5538840	post Minecraft has definitely promoted a strange relationship for many people with the game,
5538840	5542760	and bringing his name up in conversation to those passionate about the game, there's not a sense of
5542840	5547160	great anger, but more just frustration and disappointment. Like with other celebrities,
5547160	5550680	it's caused people to look back at creative decisions and question whether the science
5550680	5555080	were always there, whether they can truly enjoy a game anymore in the context of what he said,
5555080	5559320	what if they're just supporting a game with dangerous stereotypes and connotations themselves?
5559320	5563640	It's hard to deal with the implications of speech, and you can't blame people for feeling conflicted
5563640	5567160	about a game that they may have previously held very close to them throughout most of their life.
5567720	5571960	As he sold his shares, possessing or buying Minecraft doesn't really help him directly,
5571960	5576040	but even if they removed his credits, it'll always be his framework, and it's understandable
5576040	5581160	if that makes people feel a bit ambivalent. What happened to that guy that so many knew and loved?
5581160	5585080	I don't think the Marcus person that people thought they knew ever disappeared, nor do I
5585080	5589320	think that he was an inherently hateful person, but I think over the years he definitely became
5589320	5593080	a more challenging and troubled figure. He was never equipped to be a big time figurehead,
5593080	5596680	he yearned for close interpersonal bonds, the simple pleasures of a creative's life,
5596680	5600520	and he thought that cashing out his shares would allow him to get back to some form of normalcy,
5600520	5604760	but to put it as concisely as possible, his position opened up a lot of old wounds and
5604760	5608440	vulnerabilities that led him down a very dangerous path, and only seemed to halt when
5608440	5613240	he revealed how far he was down there. It traded one form of status for another, possibly worse,
5613240	5617400	form of status. He could've settled down to a long life of video game panels, Ted Talks,
5617400	5621480	and meet and greets, become a visiting professor at a state university, or just gradually work on
5621480	5626040	maintaining strong social bonds that would keep him from losing his mind. Instead, his handprints
5626040	5630200	on a game have mostly been erased, his mention provokes uncertain groans, and some people would
5630440	5634520	credit a fictional figure for the creation of one of the most universal experiences in recent
5634520	5638360	history. He always seemed to have set this, but over the years has continued to name drop
5638360	5642840	his magnum opus in many tweets, still reflecting on that era of his life, maybe only beginning to
5642840	5647560	appreciate some of it properly now, it feels like he's still not over it. Whether all his previous
5647560	5651960	actions were attempts to move past it is something only he knows, but when so much of your life is
5651960	5656760	still tied to one game and its legacy, it's hard to create a new one. I think back to one quote I
5656760	5661160	read in his blog post that if he ever accidentally ends up creating anything that might garner
5661160	5665000	attention, he'll just scrap it immediately. Notch never seemed to find a position in life
5665000	5669160	where he was truly comfortable. I think it came down to three things, resources, time,
5669160	5673880	and purpose. When he started his work he had time and purpose, but a lack of resources. As the game
5673880	5679080	took off he had resources and purpose, but no time, and after he sold his shares he had resources
5679080	5683720	and time, but no purpose, and his fear of ever gracing the spotlight again has often left him
5683720	5688360	in that limbo. In the time that he was in the public spotlight it was hard to pinpoint a moment
5688360	5692360	where Notch was ever comfortable with his life, and that eternal restlessness is something that
5692360	5697000	can really corrupt the mind. I think it put him in a spot where he consigned himself to a stasis
5697000	5700760	that he didn't want to live with. He loved programming but didn't enjoy the human aspects
5700760	5704440	of success, but didn't want to be defined by one thing, but didn't know how to escape that
5704440	5708760	definition. His love of community and desire to please people was replaced with this distrust
5708760	5713800	and resentment towards all those around him, and eventually manifested in more and more destructive
5713800	5718360	ways, leaving me to wonder if he could really rebuild his public image after it all.
5718360	5722680	One of Notch's resolutions this year was to create a new game, him making wry commentary
5722680	5726760	on his own commitment to do that. It still doesn't feel like he entirely knows what he wants.
5726760	5730760	Minecraft was one of the most stressful areas of his life, it's understandable that he doesn't want
5730760	5735400	to relive that, but sometimes you wonder if he still craves a bit of the taste. He's at a
5735400	5739560	different stage of his life now, and so is Minecraft, to the point where you wonder if they
5739560	5744600	even recognise each other. People draw parallels still, and wonder how the two grew so far apart.
5744600	5748200	However, amongst the politics, the business interests, the billions of dollars, the social
5748200	5753080	media meltdowns, the far right conspiracy theories, they still came from the same place.
5753080	5757160	That was existent before any individual or business could dip their fingers in the pie,
5757160	5761480	and although a person's evolving ideas can retroactively impact their art, the truth is that
5761480	5766200	the place that Minecraft came from could never be represented by any tweet, and the game will always
5766200	5771160	transcend whatever people put on social media accounts. We talk about art, but Minecraft isn't
5771160	5775960	just a painting, it's the whole damn gallery, and so many people would create such great work
5775960	5780760	on that canvas for years, decades, and maybe even centuries to come. So when Microsoft says
5780760	5785000	that Notch doesn't really represent Minecraft's values, I don't think they're entirely wrong,
5785000	5789720	but it was still a part of him. Minecraft is greater than any single person, even Notch
5789720	5794920	himself, but maybe Notch needs to be greater than Minecraft. As most avid Minecraft players
5794920	5799160	will probably know, upon completion of Minecraft Survival Mode, you reach the end credits of the
5799160	5804120	game, accompanied by a verse composition known as the End Poem. It lasts just shy of 9 minutes,
5804120	5807880	and takes the structure of a conversation between two beings that present themselves as all that
5807880	5812680	isn't the player, essentially the universe. It analyses many themes that Minecraft represents,
5812680	5817240	but appears to conclude that the player themselves is the answer to all the questions they may have.
5817320	5820440	You control your own destiny, you control your own fates.
5820440	5824760	At the end of 2022, the author of the poem wrote a post on the blogging site Substack,
5824760	5828040	explaining that he had made the decision to place the poem in the public domain as he had
5828040	5832040	not contractually handed over his rights to Microsoft or Mojang. However, it's the reason
5832040	5836120	behind this, and the story that inspired it, that is far more interesting. As Gough explained,
5836120	5840920	he was hired in 2012 by Person to work on the final text, and quickly struck up a camaraderie
5840920	5845800	with our Minecraft lead. However, when involving Karl Manet, the business' CEO, things quickly
5845800	5850360	turned sour as they attempted to enter business negotiations. In the end, all Gough saw from his
5850360	5854920	contributions was a single $20,000 check. The contract itself was a pretty standard but
5854920	5859320	stringent hand over all exclusive rights to Mojang, including an NDA which would've obviously
5859320	5863880	prevented Gough from even mentioning this agreement at all. However, that wasn't the kicker.
5863880	5868760	Now that came in 2014, when Gough received an email from Karl following up on the agreement,
5868760	5873720	requesting the signature once more. Gough explains that Manet had framed this as housekeeping,
5873720	5877400	when in reality research showed this was just around the time the shareholders were looking
5877400	5883160	to cash out, and were merely tying up some loose ends. With the buyout estimated to be $2.5 billion,
5883160	5887480	Gough felt a bit deceived and shortchanged, especially with how he had been treated up to
5887480	5891240	that point. He felt disrespected by people he considered friends, and although he ultimately
5891240	5895400	didn't sign the contract, it still offended him. In spite of this and the heated exchange that
5895400	5899640	followed, he didn't seek legal counsel, he didn't formally request his poem be removed from the game
5899640	5904440	despite the furor it could've caused, he merely let it be. He ultimately did nothing, and gained
5904440	5908760	nothing from it, and at first he felt bitter and resentful, but since states he has found peace.
5908760	5912600	As a matter of fact, he argues that it was an important learning curve, and although he could've
5912600	5916600	pursued it a bit more aggressively and ended up financially better off, he seems thankful he
5916600	5921320	wasn't, as he probably learned more from losing out. However, he can't properly move on until
5921320	5925480	he addresses the outstanding issue surrounding the copyright, not wishing to grant Microsoft
5925480	5929560	the exclusive rights but also not wishing to remove it from the game. He ultimately relinquishes
5929560	5933720	it to the public domain, and tells people to do whatever the hell they want with it. He was giving
5933720	5938520	his work back to the world and drawing a line under it. Originally I wrote a paragraph here
5938520	5942600	explaining why I included this anecdote, but I think I'm going to let it speak for itself.
5942600	5947000	All I'll say is that, as written at the end, you are the answer to your own questions, it's never
5947000	5951560	too late to add some chapters to your story and give people a more satisfying conclusion, you just
5951560	5955560	need to turn the page. Maybe Notch needs to be greater than Minecraft.
5959880	5964840	Yep, so there we have it, that's the video. Hard one to end honestly, it's really hard to think of a
5964840	5969800	way to wrap it up, but hopefully I have given you some food for thought at least, and maybe something
5969800	5975640	to provoke discussion. I'd really like to thank my editors, they've once again done an outstanding
5975640	5980040	job, I'm forever grateful for their contribution, it means a lot to me guys, and be sure to check
5980040	5983880	them out if you have the time, their credits are all in the pinned comment below. I'd also like to
5983880	5990040	give a thanks to my patrons, $10 patrons on screen now, or $10 plus at least, thank you very much guys,
5990040	5996600	really appreciate it, and more personal shout out to my $50 patrons, Hypercube, Esther Bedoya,
5996600	6001880	Laura Woodward, and Seri Tisch, thank you so much, your support genuinely means a lot. I'd also like
6001880	6007160	to thank the thumbnail creator, Starfo, he does great work, great work as always, and the post
6007240	6012920	editors, Scam, and Grumpy, two fantastically industrious people who did not stop at anything
6012920	6018760	to get the job done. I'd also like to thank my sponsor, Aura, it was a pleasure working with you,
6018760	6024040	they've been very very good to me, and hopefully if you enjoy using their app they can be good to
6024040	6028680	you as well. Otherwise, I hope you guys are doing well, and I hope you took something away from this
6028680	6032760	at least, this little ramble, and be sure to take care of yourselves. I don't really have too much
6032760	6037480	else to add, so I'm The Right Opinion, and I will see you in the next one.
