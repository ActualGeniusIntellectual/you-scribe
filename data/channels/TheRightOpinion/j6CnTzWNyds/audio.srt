00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,760
Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time, and a legacy,

2
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:24,040
something that I'm sure many of us have pondered. The age-old question beckons, when we all move on from this world,

3
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:28,600
what will we leave behind? The truth is, none of us can ever know for certain, because the moment we pass on,

4
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:32,800
we relinquish most control of the narrative surrounding how we're remembered. People who have been considered

5
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,800
controversial and problematic have been recontextualised by their death, and sometimes, figures previously revered

6
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:43,000
have had their involvement in some very seedy antics revealed post-mortem. In some cases, a perspective will take

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,200
centuries to form, in other times it will take merely days. However, one thing that remains central in analysis of

8
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:54,440
individuals is the existence of art. I use the term art liberally, of course, here. I'm not just talking about a painting

9
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:59,480
or a sculpture, I'm talking about the general product of any form of creative process that can affect someone's life in a

10
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:05,040
meaningful way. An artist's direct words or thoughts may be long forgotten, but their creations will always serve as a window

11
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:10,360
to their mind. What these works may say specifically is often down to interpretation, but there are often general themes

12
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:15,840
that many people identify with, which is what provides them with a following and a reputation. Upon analysis of such

13
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,960
content, many of us draw parallels between the pieces and the person behind them. After all, art should be a part of

14
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:26,400
oneself, we enjoy identifying with others, even when it extends to maestros who we could never really hope to get near in

15
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:32,240
terms of genius. For the new generation of aspiring creatives, times have somewhat evolved, particularly with the presence

16
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:37,400
of social media, which enables many people to speak more directly to their chosen audience. For those who choose to use

17
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:42,520
it, you may have a close-up on the person behind a beloved work, and based on their behaviour, you may be able to make a

18
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:47,880
summary judgement if you want to delve into their works much further. However, with all the benefits that such an experience

19
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:53,400
can provide, it can also play into unhealthy parasocial relationships, one that we've spoken about in the past,

20
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:59,400
particularly when said art may not appear to reflect a person's character. Yes, every now and then, anomalies appear on the

21
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:04,400
system, people who may have created something wonderful that many find to be an uplifting and positive force in their life

22
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:10,400
may also have negatively affected others in a marked way, either due to their actions or words separate to their art.

23
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:16,120
This is where the discourse surrounding distinguishing art form from the artist originates. Appreciating good workmanship

24
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:22,160
doesn't necessarily presuppose a complete endorsement of the person behind it. However, over time, the bar for this sort of

25
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:27,560
standard has definitely been lowered a little. With the rise of social media, and people perhaps having a bit too much time to

26
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:33,720
argue, this sort of distinction has become more and more regularly employed. A prime example of such a trend is JK Rowling,

27
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:38,920
a previously renowned celebrity who took a political position that was contrary to many of her colleagues and fans.

28
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:44,280
If she'd never sent out a tweet on the matter, many people who probably regard her with disdain would still adore her.

29
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:50,920
Humans are complex, multi-faster creatures, many of whom are deeply troubled and don't necessarily benefit from the public spotlight,

30
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:55,880
sometimes leaving us to wonder whether we knew them as well as we thought we did, and perhaps wishing we didn't know them

31
00:02:55,880 --> 00:03:02,360
quite as well now. This is what leads us to probably the most quintessentially Gen-Z example, a gentleman by the name of Marcus

32
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,400
Persson, or as he is known to many online, Notch.

33
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:25,080
Notch is a Swedish game developer, who in 2009 began a humble little project known as Minecraft. I feel like I shouldn't have to

34
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:30,360
elaborate too much here, but Minecraft is a sandbox video game which enables the user to build a multitude of structures

35
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:36,680
and face off against a variety of monsters who descend upon the player at dusk. It has four modes, creative, survival,

36
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:43,160
hardcore, and adventure, each with its own type of gamer, allowing for a very broad appeal indeed. Over the last decade

37
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:49,720
and a bit, it has amassed cross-platform sales in excess of $230 million, making it the best-selling video game of all time

38
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:55,800
by a significant margin. It has also received numerous awards, franchised itself to a dizzying extent, and established itself

39
00:03:55,800 --> 00:04:01,720
as a cultural force to be reckoned with, its timeless appeal being typified by its continued creation of public figures

40
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:08,040
who are likely just as publicly visible as the man behind the game. But in a way, I suppose it makes sense, many individual

41
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:13,160
developers are barely a fraction as well known as the games they create, they're most comfortable making the magic happen

42
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:19,560
behind the scenes, and in the case of many games, it's hardly a singular effort, and very few people end up being standout

43
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:25,320
figures. Audiences can't expect to learn the entire roster of a video game studio. Notch was different though, as the

44
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:30,680
big head behind Minecraft, he set himself apart from faceless corporations and created a unique bond with his audience,

45
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:36,200
utilising the game's network and accompanying social media platforms to create this almost legendary figure in gaming

46
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:42,120
circles, who would interact and respond to feedback from many of the devoted audience. To many, Minecraft and Notch

47
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:45,560
were inseparable. Well, until they weren't.

48
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,520
Maybe, I don't know, were you the Minecraft guy? No.

49
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:57,000
Cut to 2022 though, and trying to find any remnants of even the word Notch on Minecraft's servers would be a challenge

50
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:05,000
to even the most ardent user. Person unsurprisingly had cashed out his shares in 2014, making a tidy 1.7 billion dollars,

51
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,880
and adopting a lifestyle that supported that. In many ways, he had done what many creatives wished they could do,

52
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:15,480
walk away with a shithole of money, and have your legacy commemorated and honoured by many users and creators.

53
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:21,160
However, barely a couple of years after he'd become a billionaire, Notch began to publicly head down a curious path,

54
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:25,800
one that gradually became more and more questionable to those who looked on, and eventually resulted in Microsoft,

55
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:31,320
the company who had bought out Minecraft, to cuddle public ties with him in the hopes that a PR nightmare would be averted.

56
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:37,080
It seems that in spite of his undeniable contribution to modern culture, certain people believe he would be better off

57
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:43,320
forgotten altogether. Well, today we're going to be paying him a bit of time, taking a look at the man behind Minecraft,

58
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:49,560
the mind that married the creation, the eventual and painful divorce, and what legacy may be left behind.

59
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:54,600
Ladies, gentlemen, and all other flavours of quarks, I think it's best we go to the start,

60
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:59,160
dare I say it, to a world without Minecraft. Let's go.

61
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:06,120
This video is sponsored by Aura, and the following ad is only suitable for US citizens,

62
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,880
so if you're with me and old Blighty, then put on a cup of tea or something.

63
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:14,360
Austin, you're f***ing healing me. Heal me, you f***ing w- what, are you dumb b***h?

64
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,480
Harley, Harley, Harley, I don't really think you deserve heals, to be honest.

65
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,360
Hey, it's me, Bored Oranges, from YouTube.

66
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:23,160
Let the f***ing game, Oranges, stop flogging your channel.

67
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,560
Um, guys, I think my channel just got hacked.

68
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:27,960
Wow.

69
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:28,840
Jesus, really?

70
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:29,320
Holy shit.

71
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:34,280
I feel like, guys, I'm totally quitting Twitter, and you should give me all your money for, like, Tesla and crap and stuff.

72
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,560
Can somebody pick off that Moira?

73
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,600
Oh yeah, oh yeah, you're flogging Teslas now, Austin.

74
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,760
Elon's gonna be really, really hyped about that.

75
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:45,640
Shit, what am I even supposed to do right now? Do I contact support?

76
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,960
I do have one idea.

77
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,200
Have you heard of Aura?

78
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,360
No, uh, what is it?

79
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,160
Here, let me send you a link.

80
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:59,320
It's a privacy and security app. Sounds like something you might need.

81
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:04,440
I don't even think I could afford something like that, and how exactly is that going to help me now?

82
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,640
Well, thanks to a special deal I've been cooking up.

83
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:12,840
You can get two weeks absolutely free, so you don't have to worry about the cost while you are testing it out.

84
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,040
www.aura.com slash opinion.

85
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,960
Preferably, you'd make use of Aura before something bad happens,

86
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:24,200
but as it already has, we're going to try and stop the hackers in their tracks.

87
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,280
Do you still have access to your accounts?

88
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,800
Okay, hold on a sec.

89
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,880
Please heal me. Focus on the game.

90
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,440
Yes.

91
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,880
Okay, good, then this will be easy.

92
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:37,480
What we're going to do is kick out the hackers from your accounts before they change anything else,

93
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:42,360
and then make use of Aura's 256 AES encrypted password manager

94
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:46,200
to generate new, stronger passwords to make sure they never do this again.

95
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:49,720
Aura also lets you know if your current passwords are weak, and crucially,

96
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:53,720
if your passwords have been involved in data breaches and are exposed on the dark web.

97
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,720
Is anyone going to sort out that Reinhardt who keeps hitting my arse?

98
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:59,240
Oh, wow, that was really easy.

99
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,720
I was honestly worried there for a second.

100
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,960
Well, Aura makes staying safe online easy.

101
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,520
If you think that's good, wait till you hear about what else it can do.

102
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:09,720
My friend's been getting all these spam calls and emails due to data brokers

103
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,560
profiting off selling private information.

104
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,840
Aura will identify those data brokers that are selling your information

105
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,640
and automatically send them opt-out requests on your behalf.

106
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:23,240
Aura also does real-time credit and identity theft monitoring and has a VPN with an antivirus.

107
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:27,720
Typically, you'd have to pay for those separate features, but here you can get it all in one app.

108
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,680
Thank you, James.

109
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,680
And I mean it seriously.

110
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,240
Thank you.

111
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,480
You're most welcome, Austin.

112
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,520
You're most welcome.

113
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,920

116
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,400
Now, back to the video.

117
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,680
Can we group up already?

118
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,240
The decade is the 1980s.

119
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:58,520
Technology is emerging pretty quickly, with various movements in the industry

120
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:02,920
taking the world by storm, with many pieces of media romanticizing its popularity.

121
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:06,520
However, enthusiasm for that sector was still treated with disdain by some,

122
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,400
and as many 80s coming-of-age films will likely tell you,

123
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:13,080
the cool kids were still the ones who could flatten some poor sod in a game of football.

124
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:16,200
For many, forms of technology were an outlet to keep them away from the

125
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,240
toxic social hierarchies they felt they couldn't compete in,

126
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:23,720
and by the 80s, one of the very important branches of technology was the video game.

127
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:27,560
In early times, you would have to commute to the arcade to have a taste of what video games

128
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:31,400
actually entailed, but with the increased commercial reach and accessibility of consoles,

129
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:35,160
the market opened up much more to those who enjoyed the pastime of gaming,

130
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:39,000
not just one of those people who wasn't really interested in being the coolest at school.

131
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,680
Deeply fascinated by mechanics from a young age, he spent much of his time indoors,

132
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:46,680
initially taking a keen interest in Lego, but soon turning his attention to his personal

133
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:51,240
Commodore 1 to a computer, either playing it or programming it, much of the time with codes

134
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,960
from a magazine network that his father was subscribed to.

135
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,600
At the age of eight, he produced his first video game,

136
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,880
one that he reassuringly informed an interviewer was basic.

137
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:03,160
Back then, these sorts of pastimes were vocational to many,

138
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:06,920
very few people knew exactly where artificial intelligence would be in 20 years time,

139
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:10,680
with some still arguing the idea that an online network could never be achieved,

140
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,080
and others claiming it would just be a fad regardless.

141
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,040
But over the years, it continued to defy many of its detractors,

142
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:19,640
with persisting developments and watershed moments that set the bar higher and higher

143
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,240
in scientific accomplishment.

144
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,880
With an expanding industry in an expanding market,

145
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:27,000
a person who had dropped out of high school likely sensed an opportunity.

146
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,560
His mother put him on a programming course to hone his talent,

147
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,880
and by the time he was 18, he had his first job.

148
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:44,440
After a few rocky periods in between, he was one of the first developers hired by a Stockholm-based

149
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:48,520
company then known as Midas Player, later to become King, the corporation who made the

150
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:53,640
legendary Candy Crush Stargut, inescapable from the daily lives of all, from our phones to our

151
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:57,880
skylines. The person worked on a fair few games during his 4-5 years stint at the company,

152
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:01,720
however he always kept one of his eyes on a few side projects that he would work on in his free

153
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:07,080
time, developing a fair few games to boot. In 2006, he released the Java-based game Worm Online,

154
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:11,720
a game he had developed with long-time friend Rolf Jensen, a sandbox MMO where players could

155
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:16,200
construct buildings, mine for materials, and craft tools. Sound familiar?

156
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,960
Well, there were a few differences, it's definitely a bit more complex, probably leaning more into

157
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:24,360
games like RuneScape for its more detailed visuals and skill level system that provides people with

158
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:29,000
a clear roadmap to mastery of the arts. However, there is also a more factional element that allows

159
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,320
people to join villages and allies, declare on others if they want, alongside a religious system

160
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:37,960
that allows people to worship a certain deity, each one having their own unique perks. It provides

161
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:42,040
an arrangement where users essentially create their own lore and history within the game.

162
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:46,920
It's a clever system, and the game does appear to have some popularity to this day, but in 2007,

163
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:50,840
the year after Worm was first released, Notch stepped away from his commitment to the game,

164
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:56,280
and the studio, then known as Mojang Specifications AB. Despite moving on from this

165
00:11:56,280 --> 00:12:01,000
venture, person wished to retain the namesake Mojang for his next project. However, afraid of

166
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,040
market competition, Midas player barred him, and all employees from making games in their free time.

167
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:10,680
However, clearly valuing his individual creativity, Notch responded by quitting his job,

168
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:14,760
taking up work at a friendlier employer, and dedicating the following months to replicating

169
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,920
a game by the name of Infiniminer.

170
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:30,280
Infiniminer is a block-based sandbox game in which a player harvests minerals by cutting through

171
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:35,240
procedurally generated maps. Sound familiar? Well, yeah, this one should really. Infiniminer was

172
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:40,440
released by indie developer Zachtronics, named after its founder, Zach Barr. It wasn't particularly

173
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:44,680
hyped on release, and hadn't created large grounds well after, but it caught the attention of Marcus,

174
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:49,160
who said that although it had a clear character, still left a lot to the imagination. At the time

175
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:53,320
Marcus had been working on a project known as Ruby Dunk, a base building game in which he had

176
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:57,400
experimented with a feature that enabled first person perspective, but ultimately felt it was

177
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:02,600
too undeveloped in its current format. Although Person admired many aspects of Infiniminer,

178
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:07,000
he wished to create an environment that leaned into the more RPG theme, one that would emphasize

179
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,480
survival in the wilderness. He also wanted to focus on details of the in-game experience,

180
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:15,800
sound effects that would relate to each individual action, and how a player base may respond to that.

181
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:31,640
On May the 13th, 2009, Notch, using an account by the name of Ninzotch on YouTube, posted a video

182
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:36,840
titled Cave Game Tech Test. This upload was well received by users at the time, and a couple days

183
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,880
later, he seemed to have settled on a name, Minecraft.

184
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:54,760
In this time, Notch continued to post updates to his YouTube channel and personal Tumblr blog that

185
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:59,000
followed progress on the game pretty closely. Four days after posting Cave Game Tech Test,

186
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,680
he opened up the game to the public, providing users with a link if they wish to play it

187
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:06,760
themselves. Notch predominantly used forums for the independent game source to distribute his

188
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:10,920
new project, the same one that he had found Infiniminer on. There wasn't any real big

189
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:14,360
promotional push, nor was there any large investment from companies who believed in

190
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:18,520
the project, it was the true definition of an indie game. Just over 20 years after he had

191
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:23,080
created his first game on the Commodore 128, he had published a humble sandbox game on Java,

192
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:27,000
but the world was a lot larger now and dominated by companies who had a million times the resources

193
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:33,000
of a person like Persons. Indie games were a dime a dozen, and Notch's couldn't have been that unique, right?

194
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:52,840
Intro

195
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:57,400
Very few people know when they're making their magnum opus that it will be their magnum opus.

196
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:06,200
Intro

197
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:10,200
You can speculate how people will receive it, but you can never foresee public reaction,

198
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,560
and you can never account for every single issue that a consumer might point out.

199
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:17,080
When Notch first made the game playable, there were more than enough issues to count,

200
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:20,760
and many people were the first to let him know. However, there was definitely something unique

201
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:24,680
about Minecraft from the off. I'm not going to go through every detail, because there are creators

202
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:28,760
out there who are much more enthusiastic than me and have made it far more in-depth videos, but I

203
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:33,000
think the best way to summarise would be to say that it on one hand being a rather simple sandbox

204
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,320
allowed for a rather broad range of virtual realities, one where a world could be built around

205
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:41,720
your vision. At the same time, the RPG element, the first person perspective, gave it a more

206
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:46,040
competitive element and rewarded a person for the proficiency and skills required for survival.

207
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:50,440
Whereas Notch's previous game Worm had a system built on levels that was meant to supply an outward

208
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:55,560
motive for mastery, Minecraft was inherent. It was a simple system, but it was one that works,

209
00:15:55,560 --> 00:16:00,360
and one that you progress through naturally. A bedrock so basic that can create a world so

210
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:05,000
complex. I think the best thing that can be said about the game is that you never have the exact

211
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,640
same experience twice, and for many that was embodied by the existence of Minecraft. The

212
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:13,320
familiar aspects were there, you never had to relearn the fundamentals, there was never an

213
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:17,000
alienation of experience, and many of the processes were as simple as a few clicks,

214
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,320
but the opportunities branched off each time you decided to take your experience to the world in a

215
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:25,720
new direction. The visual design was unvarnished, making it undemanding to be seized and accessible

216
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:29,880
to many users, still retaining its own charm and feeling that it was intentional. It was also

217
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:35,160
assisted by a barebones yet effective soundtrack and sound design by C418, another frequent user

218
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:40,200
of the independent game source forum. His work can be identified by most from a single chord,

219
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:45,560
and that's impressive. Yet a game is more than its premise, and can never be flawless on launch.

220
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:48,920
That couldn't be more applicable to a game like Minecraft, which Notch decided to make

221
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:52,840
playable from the preliminary stages of production. Notch couldn't necessarily afford

222
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:57,000
his own game testers, so he relied on the feedback from users. You could tell that when it was first

223
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,680
published it was still in its teething era. Although many people enjoyed it, Marcus was

224
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:05,240
inundated with recommendations and requests from gamers who felt their experience could be enhanced,

225
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:09,480
and Notch was on it, regularly responding to people and applying updates as soon as his day

226
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:13,960
job was finished. Within three days of making the alpha open to all users, he had added a variety of

227
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:18,200
features and continued to do so over the coming weeks, including a multiplayer mode at the turn

228
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:22,360
of June. Much of this was conferred through the forums, but it soon expanded to his personal blog

229
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:26,360
and equivalent social media that became dedicated to following the progress of the game as it

230
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:30,760
garnered more and more interest from the wider internet. With the increasing popularity and

231
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:34,440
knowledge that he would probably need funds to sustain development, Notch moved the game into

232
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:38,920
a paid alpha stage for those who wanted a few more modes at their disposal. Unlike a lot of indie

233
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:43,080
games trying to capitalise on the popularity, Notch actually made a decision to make his game

234
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:47,560
a bit more expensive than he had initially valued it, linking an essay explaining the importance of

235
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:51,880
not underselling indie games. In spite of this, many people happily obliged and continued to

236
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:56,520
spread the word, leading to a snowball effect that resulted in more and more users. Videos, tweets,

237
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:01,000
posts, onto a variety of social media websites continued to serve as Notch's own unpaid

238
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,640
promotional campaign, and gave person all the time he wanted to focus on quality control,

239
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:10,360
and to be fair to him, that's exactly what he did. With the rate of unexpected success

240
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:13,640
that Notch was experiencing, it would have been easy for him to rest on his laurels or

241
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:17,880
sell his work onto an eager investor. However, with each passing day he only seemed to dedicate

242
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:22,040
more and more time to perfecting and updating the craft of this humble mining game. His

243
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:26,520
proactiveness in actually attending to problems and responding to feedback didn't seem to let up,

244
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:30,840
even as the game seemingly expanded beyond a single person's capability. He switched his day job

245
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:35,000
to part-time, hired a couple people to help him manage designs, but still placed himself at the

246
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,320
creative control panel of this undertaking, maintaining activity and status in the forums

247
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:43,880
that had so graciously supported his project. He was still a one-man army, and amongst many was

248
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:48,200
quickly obtaining status as a bit of a cult figure. However, things were beginning to spiral

249
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:52,920
out of control a little. In the first year the game moved around 25,000 copies, pretty good for

250
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:57,240
an indie game, but in 2010 it began to garner even more traction, selling thousands of copies in the

251
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:02,520
space of a day. So much income was being generated from sales that, suspecting fraud, PayPal froze

252
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:06,920
his account, which subsequently just generated more publicity. I mean, the dude was literally

253
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:11,080
keeping hundreds of thousands in his PayPal. Although Notch was on top of his game, he didn't

254
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:15,560
seem to be on top of his fame, there were some things that he just could not do on his own.

255
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:20,920
Enter stage right now, the video game's mammoth headed by another popular figure, Gabe Newell.

256
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:25,000
Noticing the success of Minecraft and the man behind it, they invited him over to Bellevue,

257
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,440
Washington to see what the prospects of future work could be. They showed him around the

258
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:32,360
headquarters, made him take some programming assessments, even having him meet with President

259
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:36,600
Mr. Newell himself. All in all, it was quite the experience, and although they believed he

260
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:40,040
had a bit to learn, they were happy to offer him a job that would hopefully provide him with a bit

261
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:43,640
of stability. However, that wasn't the only thing that happened in Bellevue.

262
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:53,720
When Notch announced he was travelling to Valve headquarters in the US, many people asked him if

263
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:58,040
a meetup was possible. Person, thinking it could be a nice initiative, decided to announce the

264
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:02,600
meeting on his Tumblr blog, jovially labelling it MinecraftCon, saying that it could be a good

265
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:06,920
idea even if it's just three people sitting around in uncomfortable silence for 20 minutes.

266
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:12,040
It wasn't quite that though, in fact over 50 people turned up, including one person in a full

267
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:16,040
creeper costume. Although it didn't last for more than a few hours, it might just have been enough

268
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:20,040
to convince Notch that although Valve's offer was likely flattering, there may be something

269
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:24,760
more worthwhile in what he already had. So he turned down the move to Valve, and instead called

270
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:29,400
up his longtime friend Jakob Pulsa, expressing the desire to take this whole little Minecraft

271
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:33,400
gig a little bit more seriously. But was that what Notch wanted?

272
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:42,040
Upon returning to Sweden, Person and Pulsa incorporated their business as Mojang AB,

273
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:46,360
later to be Mojang Studios, and brought on some additional manpower to their workforce.

274
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:50,120
They decided to commit a bit more time to game development in general, even beginning to work on

275
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:54,600
another game called Scrolls, though it's now known as Call as Bane. It seems the wheels were firmly

276
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:59,400
in motion on the Mojang machine, and not too soon after Notch was vindicated for his decision made

277
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:03,960
in September, because Minecraft's growth didn't slow, in fact it did quite the opposite, even

278
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:08,120
beginning to capture the attention of mainstream media sources. Less than 20 days after his visit

279
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:12,440
to Bellevue, a YouTube video on Minecraft topped the platform's gaming charts for the first time,

280
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:17,880
and by the end of October they had moved 500,000 copies, and by the end of the year PC Gamer UK had

281
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:23,800
heralded it as the game of the year, all while still in beta. In many ways the offer on Valve

282
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:27,800
is just what someone like Notch needed. This was a dude who had seemed a bit out of his depth at

283
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:31,480
the time, hell, he was storing hundreds of thousands of pounds in his Paypal account,

284
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:35,320
it felt like the backing of a more stable source of income was just what he needed. However,

285
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:39,880
something tells me Notch didn't bank his success on the amount of income his little project generated.

286
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:44,520
Nobody could have foreseen the success of a humble game initially posted onto an independent forum,

287
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:48,120
especially Person, and really his ability to follow this through wouldn't depend on the

288
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:52,600
amount of money he made, but more his own spark for the game, something that he clearly still

289
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,800
believed he possessed.

290
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:57,800
Does it just still make you happy to just keep working on the game every day?

291
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:04,360
Yeah, so far yes. We got another game being prototyped and it's really fun to think about that,

292
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:08,680
but so far the most fun is when I can actually just work on Minecraft.

293
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:12,600
With the attention of major developers like Valve, it would have been very easy to let his elevated

294
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:16,520
status get to him, but like a lot of accidental celebrities, Notch didn't really seem to view

295
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:20,680
himself as one, he just wanted to keep working on his project, but that was at least somewhat

296
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:25,240
difficult as the user base continued to manifest. He didn't make the game early access to the entire

297
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:29,560
world with the intent of having the entire world play it, he had to adapt, and the new business

298
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:33,960
model seemed like the best way forward. With a new business, there are new responsibilities,

299
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,600
particularly if a game wants to continue to rule the market.

300
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:42,040
In 2011, to consolidate their prosperity, the Mojang crew began to work on new versions for

301
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:46,600
other platforms, initially for mobile devices, but console projects followed not too long after.

302
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:50,360
The company also made the decision to start publishing games from other indie studios,

303
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:55,320
additionally after the success of the spontaneous meetup in 2010, it was decided that MineCon would

304
00:22:55,320 --> 00:23:00,440
become an official event, it was planned to occur from the 18th to the 19th of October in Las Vegas.

305
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:04,520
Everything was moving forward pretty smoothly, but was that the case for our title character?

306
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:08,440
Notch really was the first of his kind in many ways, and he was certainly one of the first who

307
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:12,840
became known among many for just being a developer. Although that was partly attributable to the

308
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:16,600
success of the game, it was also a credit to his hands on nature and actual interest in the

309
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:20,520
community that surrounded it. It was clear that he didn't wish to take any single person for

310
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:24,600
granted, however there's a reason that sort of approach isn't typically linked to celebrities,

311
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:29,640
to put it plainly, it's impossible to maintain. I'd say the best allegory is that of the YouTube

312
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:33,400
channel really, there are people who when they start their channel will respond to every single

313
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:37,160
comment and try and give as much attention to anybody who takes an interest in their work,

314
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:41,240
but the attention may grow to the point where you cannot tangibly engage with everyone without

315
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:45,960
sacrificing other aspects of the creative process. What people loved Notch for was a quality that

316
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:50,600
would inevitably become incompatible with his status, and with that comes a few complications.

317
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:54,840
When you have a small project, the first people who believe in it and support it are some of the

318
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:58,520
most important supporters you can have, as they're the ones who may help you find your feet in

319
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:02,680
momentum. If you reciprocate that positive attention, then these people will enjoy engaging

320
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:06,680
with you because many of them appreciate being listened to, and their voice actually having

321
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:10,600
influence. As a project grows, their voice will be diluted though, and this leads to more

322
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:14,520
dissatisfaction, the allegations that you sold out, that you're not who you used to be, you've

323
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:19,160
become lazy, etc, and you're going to come across people with completely conflicting visions of what

324
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:23,320
you should do with your content, which often just leads to nobody being satisfied. Some of these

325
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:27,240
dedicated individuals were also becoming increasingly obsessed with Notch's life,

326
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:31,960
including to the point where someone created a timeline of his in-work absences. Even if he

327
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:36,760
tried his utmost hardest, there was no way that Notch's position was sustainable, and over 2011

328
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:41,720
as pressure continued to rise it was clear that he was, as they would say, suffering from success.

329
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:47,000
In a Reddit AMA in April 2011, Notch acknowledges his nature to overstress and focus on the

330
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,720
negativity, particularly over a runaway success like Minecraft. Hava also says he has made a

331
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:56,040
commitment to managing it better, he seemed to be doing an okay job at managing that at first,

332
00:24:56,040 --> 00:25:00,200
but over the year this struggle appeared to resurface. This likely wasn't alleviated when

333
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:04,360
Bethesda filed a lawsuit claiming the game's scrolls were too similar to the Elder Scrolls,

334
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:09,400
which led to a months-long legal back and forth. Notch prevailed, but at what cost? This seemed to

335
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:14,760
climax in the 2011 Minecon, which also marked the official release of Minecraft. There was every

336
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:19,320
reason to celebrate, however it was marked by an incident involving a couple YouTubers,

337
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,480
part of the channel known as the Yogscast.

338
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:41,640
In their time, the Yogscast were one of the largest and most influential gaming channels

339
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:45,960
on YouTube. Some of their members were also enthusiastic devotees of Minecraft, and Notch

340
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:50,520
in return sang his praises for their work, so their appearance of Minecon 2011 should have been

341
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:54,200
a match made in heaven. However, not too long after their appearance on the final night,

342
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:58,440
a sleep-deprived Notch sent a series of enraged tweets that called out the pair for their supposed

343
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:03,000
delinquent behaviour which included cursing, insulting, and all-around incendiary behaviour.

344
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Yogscast responded on their subreddit, disputing Notch's version of events and criticising the

345
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,480
general organisation of Minecon. This tension persisted for a day or so before Notch relented

346
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:15,560
and put out another statement apologising for his approach, and admitting it was likely a

347
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:19,560
stress-related misunderstanding. At the height of his success, Notch should have at least been

348
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:24,280
enjoying himself, yet it seemed that it was anything but that, and it's not surprising.

349
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:28,520
He was never a person who enjoyed the public spotlight, and this increased level of tension,

350
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:32,920
especially at an event like Minecon, was only going to escalate that further.

351
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:46,280
The guy needed a break, but would he ever get it?

352
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:14,360
As noted, Notch's approach to management wasn't really one that adapted to the levels of

353
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:18,360
attention that he received. He didn't do it badly for what it was worth, but eventually you can't

354
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:22,440
keep up with the continued public analysis of your existence, particularly when it's committed to a

355
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:26,360
game that should really enable you to block out the world around you. So approximately a couple

356
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:30,120
weeks after the official launch of Minecraft and Notch's little incident with the Yogscast,

357
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,840
he announced he was stepping down as head programmer.

358
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:36,280
The title of the post is in Swedish, a statement meaning with those words

359
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:40,280
I hand over the microphone, with the rest of the short blog elaborating on a statement.

360
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:44,600
The new head designer Jens Bergensten, also known as Jeb, had been working hard on developing the

361
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:48,360
game's scrolls. The person was impressed by his work, and felt like he was the right person to

362
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:52,680
take the game forward. He doesn't really talk too much about his own mental state, only saying that

363
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:57,640
he will rest for a while, but intends to continue to help out Minecraft. With all things considered,

364
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:01,560
this was probably the right decision, it would ease the public expectation while still allowing

365
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:06,040
him to offer insight and ideas for his brainchild. Bergensten is by no means anonymous, and I don't

366
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:10,360
want to suggest that, but Notch was still the face of the company in many regards, just one that had

367
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:14,840
been stretched a bit too thin over the past few years, but would that be enough? Well, I think

368
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:19,000
the key is perspective really. The move as it had been presented was one for a person's own

369
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,840
wellbeing, however I think that Notch had to believe it himself, because whether he liked it

370
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:27,240
or not, people still primarily associated Minecraft with him above anything else, and with that in

371
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:31,000
mind there were still going to be people who held him responsible for the upkeep of the game,

372
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,240
even if it wasn't technically his obligation at all. Notch had to simply accept that these people

373
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:39,640
would exist, and stop caring about them. I think one of the problems with Notch is that he couldn't

374
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:43,800
really escape his status, I think the move lifted some mandate to do work off his shoulders,

375
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:47,960
but otherwise he was still the centre of attention, particularly as now I have a Twitter user. He also

376
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:51,880
wasn't really much of a professional when it came to his content, this wasn't an insult really,

377
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:56,600
but as you know many companies make their public representation as bereft in personality as

378
00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:00,600
possible. Notch always presented himself as a friend of the user, unlike a lot of large

379
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:04,520
companies, his stance on piracy was mostly different, occasionally even encouraging people.

380
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:08,920
He resented large companies for their acquisitions such as Google taking over YouTube, he came across

381
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:14,200
as a video game populist, but I think having such stances is always going to come with his perils.

382
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:18,280
Notch was still a significant force in a lot of decisions made around Mojang. Sure he wasn't the

383
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:22,440
number one guy for design, but as I'm sure he found out soon enough, running a company came with

384
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:26,520
more than enough baggage of its own, and eventually although you can find his position as an advocate

385
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:31,480
respectable, you soon realise why a lot of companies don't have that sort of representation.

386
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:36,120
Ultimately, Notch still bore the brunt of the decisions made by the company, even ones not

387
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:40,040
made by himself, so he was regularly bombarded with requests that he could not fulfil without

388
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:43,960
going over Jeff's head, something that he had pledged not to do, however if he didn't enact

389
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:48,120
those changes he'd be subject to a litany of rather unpleasant words, something that he took

390
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:51,960
more personally than he should have. He was an inherently high stress person who wanted to solve

391
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:56,360
every person's issue, but knew he shouldn't. Being the video game populist isn't easy when

392
00:29:56,360 --> 00:30:00,360
he was no longer the friendly game developer behind the screen, and had a multi-million dollar

393
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:04,840
franchise to oversee. In the end Notch became much more preoccupied with covering the decisions

394
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:08,600
that concerned business, sometimes dealing with complaints from large companies who weren't happy

395
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:12,120
that people were recreating their content in Minecraft. On the other side, people were

396
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:15,960
dissatisfied every time he made an executive decision that people felt may have affected a

397
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:20,200
player's in-game experience, even if it was one he felt was the right thing to do or absolutely

398
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:24,520
necessary. The sandbox format, which in many ways with the game's core appeal also began to

399
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:28,440
generate some controversy of its own over the years, now in many ways what happens in a game

400
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:32,600
like Minecraft is a player's own discretion, and developers can't be expected to intervene in every

401
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:36,280
server that offends people's sensibilities, particularly on a game with the number of servers

402
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:41,000
that Minecraft has. However, as the antics became more and more far-fetched, pressure began to mount

403
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:47,480
ultimately climaxing in a situation regarding in-game transactions. It was mid-2014, summer was

404
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:52,040
approaching quickly, but it was not all sunshine on the Minecraft servers. Discourse had flared up

405
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:56,440
on Twitter, as it always does, on the issue of donating to servers that offer certain services.

406
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:00,520
Responding to this, Mojang spokesperson Owen Hill explained that although people are more than

407
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:04,600
welcome to donate to servers, it couldn't be an exchange for equipment that gave you an in-game

408
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:09,560
advantage. Soft pay-to-win essentially. However, many users didn't agree with this and began a

409
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:14,760
hashtag titled SaveMinecraft. Although this stance was not new for Mojang, they were not known to

410
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:18,840
have enforced it, and this newfound attention drew ire from many users, who felt there were

411
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:23,880
many good servers whose existence relied on such transactions. Not frustrated by the decision

412
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:28,040
surrounding the topic did what he did best, and took to his personal blog to write a response

413
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:31,800
explaining his perspective, and explained that nothing had changed. This had always been their

414
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:36,760
stance on the matter, as written in the EULA, the End User Licence Agreement. They did not want to

415
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:41,480
sacrifice the don't pay for the gameplay principle that had motivated them all this time. Nevertheless,

416
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:45,880
the user base did not subside, some of whom pointing towards the recent Minecraft Realms

417
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:50,200
release as being a motivating factor for Mojang's decision to turn their attention towards other

418
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:54,360
paid servers. Realms was launched the month before, and allowed a person to pay £8 a month

419
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:58,680
to have private servers for up to 20 friends. This large-scale service drew comparisons that

420
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:03,480
maybe Minecraft was trying to decrease competition, not truly acting in the interest of users,

421
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:08,360
which likely provoked a more cynical response from gamers. Notch from his perspective clearly

422
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:12,280
felt like he was doing the right thing, and he always took a lot of pride in it. He was always

423
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:16,360
facing off with the sect of people who believed he was acting in his own self-interest, and with

424
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:21,560
the large-scale movement against the decision that he felt was pretty cut and dry was the final straw.

425
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:26,360
So on the 16th of June, a frustrated and enraged Notch typed out a tweet in the heat of the moment,

426
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,080
and everything changed.

427
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:47,000
Anyone want to buy my share of Mojang so I can move on with my life? Getting hate for

428
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:51,400
trying to do the right thing is not my gig. The tweet in question wasn't a serious business

429
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:55,720
proposition, but it did catch the attention of a few serious businesses, who contacted Notch's

430
00:32:55,720 --> 00:33:00,040
colleagues and asked him if he was for real. At first unsure, the idea of being able to completely

431
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:05,160
disassociate from all the burdens he felt saddled with began to inspire some ideas. Every major

432
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:09,320
company knew the cash cow that Mojang was, a business with less than 50 employees, yet

433
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:13,320
generating hundreds of millions in revenue each year. It was a corporate wet dream, and if they

434
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:17,160
were going to sell, there was hardly a gaming behemoth that didn't want a slice. However,

435
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:21,320
it didn't take too long for the frontrunner to emerge. That frontrunner was the humble,

436
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:24,280
full-scale firm known as Microsoft.

437
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:29,160
So how do you run your Minecraft company? Have you sold out to the evil corporations yet?

438
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,320
No, not yet. We hope not to.

439
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:35,080
Now, to be fair, the company had to be somewhat large to even afford to buy out the shares on

440
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:39,000
offer. We'll get to the price of the deal in a bit, but Notch wanted a company who were in

441
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,400
touch with the preservation of what made Minecraft special. He had dealt with Microsoft before,

442
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:47,320
occasionally expressing frustration with their practices, but regularly also demonstrating

443
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:51,480
affection for those who he worked with to bring Minecraft to their platforms, even at some points

444
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:56,120
promoting rumours of an exclusivity deal, which he seemed to sarcastically refer to. All I can

445
00:33:56,120 --> 00:34:00,360
affirmatively say is they were probably a better choice to Notch than EA. With this in mind,

446
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:04,760
Microsoft moved in to close the deal. They had the additional motive of the ever wholesome subject

447
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:09,480
of tax avoidance due to our functioning economic system, a deal with Mojang would facilitate.

448
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:13,320
You'd love to see it. So they were prepared to offer the big bucks, and when I say big,

449
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:17,960
I mean hard to even quantify. Person's shares totaled just shy of 1.8 billion dollars,

450
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:23,160
Paul's shares around 300 million, and then CEO Carl Manet's shares 100 million,

451
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:27,720
not your average shopping bill to say the least. This was all finalised and officially announced

452
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:33,320
on the 15th of September 2014, with a post on Notch's Tumblr titled I'm Leaving Mojang,

453
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:37,240
which goes more into depth about how interactions with his user base had shaped his current

454
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:41,320
perspective. He already knew he would never be able to recreate a success like Minecraft,

455
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:45,560
but wanted to stay on as the figurehead because he believed there was some symbolic value to that.

456
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:50,040
Javi came to the conclusion that he didn't enjoy it, he was just really this space on a game that

457
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:53,800
he didn't really feel attached to anymore, a source of people's enjoyment and pain that he

458
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:58,120
didn't understand. In his words, he's merely a nerdy computer programmer who likes to have

459
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:01,960
opinions on Twitter. Although the money was nothing to turn your nose at, he stresses that

460
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:06,360
it wasn't about the money, it was about the sanity. I wonder how people would respond to that.

461
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,680
Well, most of them took it pretty well actually, there were a few people who regarded him as a

462
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:14,520
sellout, but he'd been called a sellout by plenty of people in his time, and that wasn't anything

463
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:18,120
new. It was obviously difficult for some people to rationalise given that the person had always

464
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:22,840
been outspoken about a lot of the threatening overreach of big tech, but his move wasn't really

465
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:27,000
one for any of the companies, it wasn't an endorsement of such, it was just what he thought

466
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,960
was best for himself, he had to get out, and that was his way. Among other people affected by this

467
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:36,520
were the members of staff, upon learning on his departure they were reported to be disappointed,

468
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:40,920
and that makes sense especially given they were now under the gaze of a much more cutthroat company,

469
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:44,760
but Notch had taken steps to ensure that no layoffs would occur, which given the modest

470
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:49,400
numbers of Mojang's workforce, Microsoft were happy to abide by. All staff members who remained

471
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:53,880
at the company for the next six months also received a $300,000 bonus from Notch's share,

472
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:57,720
which obviously wasn't anything near the levels of money Marcus had been paid, but it wasn't

473
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:02,040
derisory either. It was generally reported that Microsoft mostly took a hands-off approach and

474
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:05,960
merely offered their resources and investment to the team over at Mojang in exchange for the

475
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:10,040
profits they were making. Overall it was considered by most to be an example of a transaction done

476
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:14,040
right, one that didn't lead to the immediate demise of a product or those who worked tirelessly

477
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:18,360
on it. At the same time, although you'd be hard-pressed not to understand Person's viewpoint,

478
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:22,360
it's hard not to feel a bit solemn about the circumstances that precipitated it.

479
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:27,080
Although Person's tenure probably did centralise his status a bit too much, I mean hell, he once

480
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:31,720
placed above Barack Obama in a time person of the year poll. His success was still an inspiration to

481
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:36,360
many, he'd become representative of an individual creative using the online world to make something

482
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:41,720
greater than any major studio could ever concoct, and his concern for personally involving himself

483
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:46,040
in creating a consumer-based experience felt refreshing for many who played the game. It

484
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:50,520
created a community with an identifiable figure at the centre of it. His departure didn't mean

485
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:54,280
the game was suddenly going to take a nosedive, and in a way some people's fallacious belief that

486
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:58,200
he was one of the key factors in maintaining the game's appeal was disproven after he left,

487
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:02,360
but it did reduce the power of the community on a large company who isn't really known for their

488
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:07,240
consumer empowerment. Eventually those aspects of corporatism were going to seep in, and there'd

489
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:12,600
be nothing that anyone could do about it. Sometimes it's nice just to have someone there to listen.

490
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:16,680
Ultimately this was all rooted in a situation though where the person who listened had heard

491
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:20,920
enough. Anyone who cares that much about a game is not going to be able to withstand the pressure

492
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:25,480
of maintaining it. Minecraft was one person's passion that became so much greater than that.

493
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:29,480
In Notch's statement he writes, if I ever accidentally make something that seems to gain

494
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:33,880
traction, I'll probably abandon it immediately. Some people may have been able to navigate the

495
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:38,920
tricky social environment better, but Notch was not that person, he never was. That's what made

496
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:43,240
him popular, that's what made him like, he was the everyman, he was the underdog who rose up to change

497
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:47,160
the gaming industry, he didn't have politically adept social skills or a decade-long college

498
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:51,640
education, he was a guy who just did what he felt like doing. He showed that the stereotype

499
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:56,280
for the nerd staying in his room on his computer wasn't as negative as some thought it to be.

500
00:37:56,280 --> 00:38:00,120
In the end the popularity made his status untenable though, he couldn't be everybody's

501
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:04,040
everyman, but he still walked away from a game that would revere him as one of the greatest

502
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:08,520
examples of independent enterprise in modern history. Well, he could have.

503
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:21,640
Marcus Persson was rich, and everyone knew it.

504
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:26,040
It's hard not to let success change you in some way, and often you should change with success,

505
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:29,640
because it typically places you in a different position than one you were in previously.

506
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:33,640
Even if you didn't intend on becoming famous, if you're going to continue operating in that

507
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:38,280
domain you have to adapt. While he was working on Minecraft, Notch seemed hesitant to do that.

508
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:43,000
In 2011 he made over 100 million dollars, and his response to questions on how he was going

509
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:47,880
to spend it was perhaps obtaining a driver's license and a car, almost comedically modest.

510
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:52,200
When he did splash out it was only really with other people, such as work trips and conventions.

511
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:56,280
He obviously cared less about his shopping bill than most, but he never seemed to let that wealth

512
00:38:56,280 --> 00:39:01,000
distract him from the lifestyle he was accustomed to. However, the sale of his shares in Minecraft

513
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,680
changed that, not just because it earned him an obscene amount of money at once, but because it

514
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:09,320
removed a commitment that he had felt attached to for years. As long as he was tied to that game,

515
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:13,160
no matter how much money he made, Notch seemed almost paranoid that it could still collapse

516
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:17,000
at any moment. He waited over a year to fully quit his job, despite the fact that Minecraft

517
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:21,880
was generating far more income. Even when success seemed near guaranteed, Notch felt the reputation

518
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:26,040
of a game weighing on his actions. That was gone now, and he had all the time to do what he wanted

519
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:32,120
to. Well, what would he do? He decided to treat himself, it seems. First on his list of goodies

520
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:36,360
was a new abode. Person went for the ever popular celebrity location in Beverly Hills,

521
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:41,640
spending 70 million dollars and outbidding Jay-Z and Beyonce on a 23,000 square foot mansion with

522
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:46,440
its own carlift. How quaint. It was soon reported that he had been spending his nights in Las Vegas

523
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:50,920
blowing upwards of 100k in a single outing to the nightclubs, casinos, and the rest. In interviews,

524
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:55,320
his mantra appeared that he was making up for lost time, and everything he was never able to do as a

525
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:59,240
young adult working his ass off in the industry. He acknowledged that it wasn't the wisest way to

526
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:03,720
spend one's fortunes, but it was for him. He was living the high life, that much is true,

527
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:09,880
private rooftop pools, crystal champagne, and Skrillex, the ultimate triad. This was all shared

528
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:13,640
through his Twitter and Instagram, which now served a very different purpose for Notch, and

529
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:17,800
his attitude certainly reflected that. When people tried to dunk on him, he'd regularly respond with

530
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:21,480
memes and lighthearted jives to show that ultimately, whatever people said wouldn't change

531
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:25,480
where he was at with life. In spite of all this, he had pledged to donate a fair sum of his money

532
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:30,200
to charity, and set some aside for family, but life is more than what you want to do with money.

533
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:36,600
What other plans did he have? Well, it appeared uncertain. On the 3rd of March 2015,

534
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:40,840
an interview was published with Forbes that delved into the headspace of Notch following the sale.

535
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:45,160
It reported that he had since started a new company known as Rubberbrain, located in central

536
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:48,760
Stockholm. Him and his colleagues had been throwing around some new ideas and occasionally

537
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:52,760
testing them, but mostly just trying to have a good time. Whatever their plans were, it wasn't

538
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:56,920
to create a new blockbuster. On the question of his place in the current gaming environment,

539
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:00,920
he didn't really know where he wanted to be, but one thing was certain, that he hadn't regretted

540
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:06,120
selling his shares, he just wanted to pass away the days having a good time with his friends.

541
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:10,760
But how long would that last? I have a good friend who posted a principle in a philosophical

542
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:15,160
discussion we were having a few months ago, the necessity of human struggle. His argument

543
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:20,200
basically suggested that we as people need to experience some aspect of adversity to truly feel

544
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:25,000
fulfilled. He likened it to a room that closes in on a person, the idea that many of us need those

545
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:29,240
walls to push back against, something of a challenge, or what else if we ultimately lose our

546
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:33,240
own purpose in the world. Now obviously some people struggle far too much, and other people

547
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:37,080
get by alright without struggling, but I think there is a relevance, particularly for people who

548
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:41,720
are used to some form of pressure, to have that completely removed from them. It's a very difficult

549
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:45,960
environment to adapt to. Struggle is relative, and if you've spent your whole life with this strong

550
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:50,440
sense of purpose, to have yourself completely absolved of that purpose is quite jarring,

551
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:54,760
and barely a few months after the Forbes article was published, Notch's celebratory tone appeared

552
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:59,880
to take a turn towards something more pessimistic. On August the 29th, Notch sent out a series of

553
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:03,480
tweets that appeared to lament his current lifestyle, initiating with the statement,

554
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:07,720
the problem with getting everything is you run out of reasons to keep trying, and human interaction

555
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:12,120
becomes impossible due to imbalance. Notch then proceeds to talk about how although he has

556
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:16,440
everything, he feels completely alienated, unable to create a human connection with those around

557
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:21,240
him, especially on an intimate basis as people find his lifestyle overwhelming. He also seems

558
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:25,000
frustrated at the fact that many of his former colleagues still seem to resent him, despite

559
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:29,080
him believing that he treated them well. When one of the employees says that much of the response

560
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:33,720
was just the initial shock, he completely flips out on them, saying fuck all of you, which seemed

561
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:38,840
a bit much for many people at the time. He had no trust for the world around him, and it shows.

562
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:42,920
The mail cloud may have been momentary for many, but it certainly outlined a real cloud to the

563
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:47,640
silver lining of selling out. Unfortunately Notch had reached this stage of success and influence

564
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:51,720
where people treat you differently because of it. Even people close to you can seem distant,

565
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:56,520
and you can't really trust their intent. You need mental fortitude to manage that, and to be frank,

566
00:42:56,520 --> 00:43:02,120
Marcus was a somewhat fragile person, and once the initial euphoria of that newfound wealth wore out,

567
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:07,080
he probably wondered what was left. This brief tirade inspired a few reports and response articles

568
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:11,160
from people who didn't necessarily have great sympathy for his predicament, but probably prompted

569
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:15,960
the same suggestion for a solution. Person needed to find a way to alienate himself from that wealth

570
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:21,400
and status. It's not an easy solution to undertake, but the problem will continue to be inescapable as

571
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:25,720
long as he had nothing to work for and nobody to actually share it with. Snoop Dogg even weighed

572
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:30,200
in on the matter, reminding persons that knowing who your real ones are is much more important than

573
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:35,080
any material wealth. I don't think anyone needs Notch's level of money to be happy. You shouldn't

574
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:38,840
have to give away your wealth to be happy necessarily, but you need to have something that can

575
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:44,120
transcend the purpose of that money, whether that be friends, work, or an alternative outlet. Reflecting

576
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:49,000
on Notch's life, maybe his purpose was rooted in a struggle of sorts with Minecraft, and optimizing

577
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:54,360
it, and now that it ended, so had Person's own greater sense of self. Marcus Person was rich,

578
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:58,760
and everyone knew it, but for someone like him, that was seeming more like a curse and a blessing,

579
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:03,320
and his rant, although aggressive, was to show great vulnerability. He needed something greater

580
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:06,120
to latch on to, but maybe we got something worse.

581
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:17,640
A few days after his venting session on the social media website, Notch decided to respond

582
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:21,800
to those who suggested that he give his wealth away, stating that money wasn't the problem,

583
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:26,280
it was the lifestyle, and although he may not be wrong, if you let your money influence your

584
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:30,360
lifestyle then you're feeding the problem, and less than a couple months later he was back in

585
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:35,480
Vegas. He seemed to attribute his current downcast mindset to the success, but he'd been successful

586
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:39,640
for a while, it was just that this time round he had something else to account for that success,

587
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:44,120
and it simply wasn't enough. It distanced himself from nearly everyone in his life, and made him

588
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:49,080
untrusting of the world around him. Notch was the paranoid wreck who had no idea of where he was

589
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:53,080
meant to go from here, and expressing it online wasn't going to help, as the whole place can often

590
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:57,000
feel like you're headed in circles. You'd think that after he sold his shares he'd have a lot less

591
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,920
to say on the world wide web, but for someone who didn't want to be the centre of attention anymore,

592
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:05,560
he often still seemed obsessed with social media platforms. In his departure post he characterised

593
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:09,800
himself as a nerdy computer programmer who likes to have opinions on Twitter, but it seemed more

594
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:14,120
than just the occasional hot takes at this point, to be honest he seemed ever more invested with the

595
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:18,440
goings on around him, and that only continued to manifest itself as the online world became

596
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:23,560
increasingly political. As we all know, 2016 was a strange time for the internet on reflection,

597
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:29,000
particularly with the cosmic rise of Donald Trump, and the general movement towards anti-SJW content

598
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:33,160
that seemed to target people who were not always the best at expressing their beliefs. When working

599
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:37,800
on Minecraft, Notch had generally seemed to adopt quite progressive ideas towards his game. Although

600
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:41,720
not overtly political, he said that every character was genderless, and that people had a right to

601
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:45,960
interpret each of them to their own liking. It was part of Minecraft after all, the fact that

602
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:50,440
an individual can have an experience personal to them. Despite not explicitly endorsing anyone

603
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:54,840
before 2016, Notch was someone who would have been mostly aware of the discourse within political

604
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:59,240
spheres, and throughout 2015 he had mostly expressed disdain for the prospective Republican

605
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:03,560
candidate, Donald Trump, calling him a loon, and exhibited genuine confusion at people's

606
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:07,560
belief in his suitability for office. He'd interacted with a few YouTubers who expressed

607
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:12,760
anti-SJW beliefs, and stated that he would support Bernie Sanders if choosing between him and Hillary.

608
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:16,360
As the US election approached, he seemed to become more and more invested in the issue though.

609
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:20,120
Although it is vocal that he was not a fan of Trump's, he turned most of his eye towards Hillary

610
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:23,960
Clinton, who he felt had acted dishonestly. I'm not going to go into every single detail

611
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:27,880
regarding his political beliefs at this specific point in time, but as election day approached,

612
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:31,560
his stance on Trump continued to soften, and eventually he admitted that if he was forced

613
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:35,560
to choose between Trump and Clinton, he would probably choose Trump. This wasn't an exceptional

614
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:40,040
stance at the time, particularly online, people's resentment for Clinton was very palpable, and many

615
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:44,200
didn't want her to win just for the principle that they thought the Democrats had the opportunity to

616
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:48,920
present a genuinely radical candidate, well at least by the standards of US politics. Trump

617
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:53,800
became the anti-hero, anti-establishment figure that in spite of his very visible flaws became

618
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:58,120
a punishment to all those happy to settle for a miserable status quo, therefore although his

619
00:46:58,120 --> 00:47:02,840
opinions were a little outspoken for a person of his status, these didn't exactly strike anyone as

620
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:07,160
truly frightening. I think establishment is a very important word to use when analysing these

621
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:11,160
figures, because Notch is an independent game developer who cared deeply about the game he

622
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:16,040
designed, similarly saw himself as a figure taking on the long entrenched bureaucracies and structures

623
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:19,320
that they employed to stay in power. He'd always believed that many in the industry

624
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:22,760
players sacrificed user experience for their own gain, and they would try and

625
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:26,920
oppress any actual innovation. Notch was one of the few large gaming entrepreneurs who didn't

626
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:31,480
outwardly attack masses like piracy, he was an advocate for the little guy in in-game experience.

627
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:35,080
Additionally, he had always been largely skeptical of national governments, and expressed deep

628
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:39,400
concern about a surveillance state, particularly that relating to the US. That is where we

629
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:44,280
introduce the sort of SJW that he also seemed to rally against during the election of Donald Trump,

630
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:48,840
additionally crediting their behaviour as much to the reason that the Don got elected. The sort

631
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:53,240
of political correctness that many of them preached was not something Notch had ever related to.

632
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:56,840
Sure, he wasn't the sort of person who was particularly offensive or hurtful to people,

633
00:47:56,840 --> 00:48:01,560
but he always saw issues like freedom of speech as being non-negotiable, he saw any attack on it as

634
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:06,120
an act of tyranny, designed to oppress people who may speak truth to power. He wanted to fight

635
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:11,160
against what he saw as this corporate sterilisation of people's expression. He was also becoming

636
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:15,160
increasingly involved in issues relating to the treatment of quote white men, and the use of

637
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:19,720
identity politics in general. Now, I wouldn't describe any of his positions as hateful, or even

638
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:24,200
with the intent to do harm at this point. Sometimes I think he spoke from a point of genuine frustration

639
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:28,680
towards toxic factions in many movements who were advocating for otherwise righteous causes.

640
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:34,680
However, his frustration didn't subside in the year following, particularly with the online world further contorting.

641
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:59,240
But why should it matter to someone like Marcus Person? The dude wasn't the target of this,

642
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:03,320
and it's not like his freedom was being affected by it. Well at the start of 2017,

643
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:07,720
a few large YouTubers, most notably PewDiePie came under scrutiny for their behaviour online.

644
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:11,720
At the time, many who sympathised with these creators saw large corporations punching down

645
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:15,720
on the freedom of expression previously held by many creators, whether or not the humour was in

646
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:20,120
good taste. In particular, this sort of battle emerged all over the internet between traditional

647
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:24,120
standards and the sort of wild west approach that other parts of the online world possessed,

648
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:28,120
and how increasingly influential in modern culture they were becoming. The online world and their

649
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:32,600
communities were facing down reproval from many angles, especially from those who felt it excluded

650
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:37,080
and alienated marginalised groups who deserved a space as much as anyone else. This all then

651
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:40,920
reached into the video game industry, particularly given the aftermath of the gamergate, something

652
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:44,920
that Notch had previously stayed rather neutral on, but now seemed to feel quite strongly about.

653
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:49,400
This criticism of the current online culture was often advocated by progressively identifying

654
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:54,600
people, the SJWs per se, who were also vociferously anti-Trump. I think a fair few people who were

655
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:59,240
attached to that sort of wild west of the internet drew a correlation between Trump and a specific way

656
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:03,480
of online life, particularly that freedom of speech given how Trump was a pretty unfiltered

657
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:08,040
person to say it lightly. Well, with infinite time and money, I guess Notch had finally found

658
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:10,760
another struggle, but was this one worth fighting for?

659
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:24,600
Marcus Person had always held a sort of morbid curiosity for these sorts of areas,

660
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:28,680
discussing the often contentious 4chan in an early interview, he describes it as possibly

661
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:33,320
being one of the closest things we've got to a self-conscious virtual entity on the internet,

662
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:37,720
even referencing it in an old intro screen for the game. In many ways, that sort of independent

663
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:41,960
minded section of the internet was what put Minecraft on the map, and so it wasn't completely

664
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:46,520
beyond belief why he felt protective about it. I think in many ways, people like Notch saw these

665
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:50,360
establishment types coming in and trying to dictate their own standards that much of the

666
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:54,280
internet didn't perceive similarly. I think it's fair to say that although Notch's opinions on the

667
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:58,120
matters in the previous part weren't completely out of nowhere given his background, they were

668
00:50:58,120 --> 00:51:02,280
somewhat different to many around him at the time, and it definitely alienated some people.

669
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:06,120
When someone asked him why it seemed like everyone hated him now, he replied they didn't hate him,

670
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:09,800
they agreed, but were just afraid to speak up, and as what he said received pushback,

671
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:14,600
he became more and more stubborn, and in turn more and more irrational. Even if he agreed with

672
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:18,680
any point he was making, it was lost in the sense that he was fighting a greater cultural battle.

673
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:22,920
When an incident occurred at VidCon involving Anita Sarkeesian clashing heads with her critics,

674
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:27,800
and Ant Green responding, he tagged Green telling him to be on the right side of history.

675
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:31,960
That's a strong term for a situation that related to a commentary spat at a panel. At the end of

676
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:36,600
Pride Month in 2017, there was a movement called Heterosexual Pride Day. Notch noticed this and

677
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:40,920
stated that if you didn't support it, you deserve to be shot. Eventually, he did retract this

678
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:44,920
statement and apologise, but it was clear that he was taking this all a little too seriously.

679
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:48,920
It was clear that this was a historic battle to person for the soul of society, and this seemed

680
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:54,200
to be influencing his political beliefs as well. In a May 2017 interview, then President Donald

681
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:58,280
Trump made the bold claim that he invented the phrase priming the pump, which is particularly

682
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:02,840
impressive given that in modern terms, it was first applied in the 1930s, the decade before

683
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:07,080
Trump was born. Mockery ensued, and many people took to their favourite social media site to take

684
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:11,800
the piss, including video game writer and YouTube critic Mikey Newman. Person after having the

685
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:15,960
reference explained to him makes the judgment that it is just more baseless Trump bashing because

686
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:20,120
they are afraid, which certainly prompted some confusion. It seemed that as the months passed,

687
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:24,360
Notch had become more preoccupied with his idea that every narrative against Trump was part of

688
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:29,160
some great conspiracy to prevent him from making America great again, and well, it's a bit far

689
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:33,560
fetched. The thing about a lot of conspiracy theories is that they do often start with one

690
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:37,960
genuine observation. Were certain echelons of the media disproportionately outraged with Trump's

691
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:41,960
presidency when they'd given others a pass? You could make an argument for it. You could say that

692
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:46,040
they weren't anywhere near as critical as previous presidencies when they enacted policy that could

693
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:50,200
significantly harm a population. However, the fallacious link comes when you conclude that

694
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:53,880
therefore they hate Trump because he's finally doing the right thing, rather than the fact that

695
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:58,120
he's unorthodox and generates views for financially focused businesses. There were plenty of people

696
00:52:58,120 --> 00:53:01,800
online who were quite aware of establishment's shortcomings, but also felt like it was still

697
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:05,720
bad to point out issues regarding Trump. When he makes a claim that he invented a term that

698
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:09,800
existed before he was born, then yeah, I don't think it's unjustified to have a bit of a chuckle

699
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:14,360
about it. However, Notch didn't seem to be seeing it this way, and neither were a lot of Americans.

700
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:18,120
So with that in mind, let's talk about a little conspiracy theory that occurred the year before,

701
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:22,840
known as Pizzagate. Pizzagate was the allegation that there was an insidious, satanic underground

702
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:27,800
sex ring being operated by the Clintons and Democrats out of a Washington DC pizzeria. It was

703
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:32,440
rooted in an email link from a Clinton campaigner which theorists claimed contained a secret code

704
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:36,760
that tied all of this together, and eventually resulted in a gunman turning up to the pizzeria

705
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:40,840
and firing his rifle at the institution. There were deluge of other related incidents to the

706
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:45,000
theory which has widely been discredited by mainstream institutions, emphasis on the

707
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:49,160
mainstream institutions here. Now that's not to say it has credit, I personally don't think it does,

708
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:52,760
but when you believe a theory that dictates all authority figures are in on something,

709
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:57,880
them telling you it doesn't exist isn't going to be convincing enough. Pizzagate mostly fizzled out

710
00:53:57,880 --> 00:54:03,480
after the 2016 election, particularly given that Donald Trump actually won, but in August 2017,

711
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:07,960
Notch published a tweet stating that in fact, Pizzagate was real. A bit late to the party,

712
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:11,560
all things considered, but quite the claim regardless. In elaborating on his stance,

713
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:15,560
he rants about binary politics, and how there might actually be pieces of evidence that have

714
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:19,880
supported this theory, but that it might also be drugs, though the pedestrians do look like people

715
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:25,400
in a police sketch, and the pizza place has weird art and branding, etc. There were already a lot of

716
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:30,200
retorts online to the claims made in Notch's very long thread, but he seems certain something is up,

717
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:34,200
and although people may perceive his thread as being a bit behind the current political discourse,

718
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:38,120
it may not have been as unprompted as some people thought. On the forums like 4chan,

719
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:42,440
this narrative had been brewing, but one that integrated a new perspective, that Donald Trump

720
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:46,840
was aware, and working to bring this worldwide satanic cabal down, and there would only be a

721
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:51,160
matter of time until many significant public figures were reprimanded and charged. Similar

722
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:55,400
versions of this story had already been promoted on the polls section of 4chan, but come October

723
00:54:55,400 --> 00:55:00,200
this began to escalate. On the 27th of the aforementioned month, a user by the name of

724
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:04,760
QClarencePatriot claimed that Hillary Clinton was soon going to be arrested, and civil unrest

725
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:08,840
would follow. QClarence is a level of clearance used for the Department of Energy, it gives you

726
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:12,680
access to a variety of data that would otherwise be restricted to the public, the inference here

727
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:16,280
being that this guy was someone high up in government, and he was speaking out due to his

728
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:20,280
patriotic nature. This seemed to capture the imagination for many in the forum, and was

729
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:24,120
followed quickly by another post that seemed to incriminate other popular democratic figureheads

730
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:27,880
and donors, implying that there would soon be a large-scale reckoning for all those who Trump

731
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:32,040
viewed as criminal rogue elements. This would quickly manifest and grow, receiving more and

732
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:36,040
more media attention, and garnering a following from many committed Trump devotees. I think what

733
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:40,200
happens to many people is the feeling of a greater cause and explanation for Trump's actions. He had

734
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:44,120
always pledged to drain the swamp, and deliver justice to a system that legitimately been rigged

735
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:48,920
against so many people. Q himself occupied this position of unfalsifiability, whose content could

736
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:53,480
only be proven by time, and often leveraged on the belief of the individual, and it turned out that

737
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:57,640
many were actually quite prepared to believe. Although Notch was not necessarily directly

738
00:55:57,640 --> 00:56:01,320
involved with anything QAnon related in its inception, and there's no direct evidence

739
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:05,000
tying him to that, the correlation between his interest in Pizzagate and the founding of this

740
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:08,840
sector of the internet seemed to imply that he was spending a bit too much time in these forums,

741
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:12,840
and as he became more and more outspoken, people began to take notice.

742
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:27,880
Make no mistake, Notch had definitely been pushing people's buttons online, but overall,

743
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:31,560
this hadn't affected his status related to his work at this point, likely because most of his

744
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:35,480
tweets didn't have much staying power online, and people didn't really care enough about some dude

745
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:39,960
shouting into the void. He held steadfast on most of his opinions, but up to the end of 2018,

746
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:44,120
he didn't seem to garner much attention outside the discourse sphere that he was involved in.

747
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:47,880
However, there was the occasional reference to Operation Mockingbird, a theory that refers to

748
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:51,800
the alleged brainwashing of the public through media propaganda, and had been regularly mentioned

749
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:56,760
by those on QAnon, and Q himself who mentions it in his original post. Although it never attracted

750
00:56:56,760 --> 00:57:01,000
that much media attention, it was indicative of what he was doing with his time. However,

751
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:04,920
as Notch's takes grew increasingly strong, there was a sense that what he was saying couldn't be

752
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:09,480
ignored. This began in December 2018, which was met with a flurry of statements by person,

753
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:13,640
some relating to race, some relating to general political identity, and just some relating to

754
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:17,560
whatever the hell this is. He still presented himself as someone on the side of the little guy,

755
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:21,400
but it seems he had identified a greater battle against those who were at the top, and the far

756
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:25,880
left who were controlling every aspect of his life. If you were with them, you were ontologically

757
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:29,960
evil. There was no two ways about it. Now, these tweets were definitely more concerning than the

758
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:33,640
previous sets. The least you could say about his comments up to this point was that although they

759
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:38,120
were often provocative, the intended targets were often general concepts of political correctness,

760
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:42,840
SJWs, and establishment figures, all of which were not without their flaws, even if the obsession

761
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:47,000
with them was a bit overwrought on Notch's behalf. However, these tweets seem to harp on some other

762
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:50,600
more questionable theories, in particular relating to IQ differences between racial

763
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:54,840
populations. Now, this has been the subject of debate in certain scientific circles, with many

764
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:59,480
broadly on the side of the opinion that IQ is not affected by race, more due to other environmental

765
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:03,960
factors that may coincide with race. However, how does a human generated spectrum of intelligence

766
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:08,120
help discussion on racial differences? How would it dictate the world we live in? The truth is that

767
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:13,320
people are still individuals, and anyone from any race can be really smart or really stupid.

768
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:17,240
Notch had clearly grown to hate the general state of the gaming industry, as he felt it was dictated

769
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:21,400
by a small proportion of easily offended people. The left received a lot of the blame when companies

770
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:24,920
made decisions that others thought they were being pressured into, but many of them were decisions

771
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:28,520
ultimately made by the company. What would anyone who actually felt strongly about these matters

772
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:32,360
done if the businesses in this industry just turned around to them and said no we're not doing

773
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:36,360
that, or just ignored them? Probably not much, maybe some angry tweets, but that would be it.

774
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:40,040
And Notch has survived alright to this point. Despite the fact that he didn't have direct ties

775
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:43,880
to any companies, he was still symbolically associated with Minecraft and commemorated in

776
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:48,840
the game. However, come March 2019, Notch was once again ready to test that, and this time he was

777
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:53,240
going all out. First mentioning Operation Mockingbird again, but then dropping any innuendo

778
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:57,480
and just outwardly stating that Q was legit, and that we should not be trusting the media.

779
00:58:57,480 --> 00:59:01,160
To be honest, I don't trust the media too much either, but for someone who doesn't like binary

780
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:05,400
politics, he sure likes to make binary choices. After a couple days of continuing to push these

781
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:09,320
general narratives that the populace was being lied to by the establishment, he takes it to it

782
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:13,240
to make the interesting observation that suddenly all the requests for him to stream and podcast

783
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:17,560
have stopped. How curious, I guess the establishment decided that his time was none,

784
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:21,720
but his Twitter was still growing, which is something I guess. I mean, he was making up to

785
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:26,360
100 tweets a day. With Notch fully embracing the QAnon movement and the man behind it,

786
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:29,960
he definitely raised a few eyebrows, with articles being published on his recent turn to

787
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:34,120
conspiracy theories. However, not finished to his crusade, he turns his attention to a variety of

788
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:38,040
matters, first drawing a comparison between dressing as another race and dressing as the

789
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:41,880
opposite gender, and saying there is no difference. This opinion didn't seem to attract

790
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:45,960
too much traffic, as it could be seen as referring to cross-dressing. However, not too long after,

791
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:49,560
Notch was back to business on a plethora of fronts, sometimes posting rather vaguely,

792
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:53,480
which attracted some QAnon responses, other times just cutting the chase and reminding

793
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:57,640
people that casual murdering of infants for organ harvesting purposes is not acceptable.

794
00:59:57,640 --> 01:00:02,040
Hard agree on that one Notch. He then writes a thread seemingly going truth mode on society,

795
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:05,720
you cannot negotiate with these people who are trying to destroy human civilization as we know

796
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:09,560
it. At least that's what I take from the thread, though the last two tweets seemed more direct to

797
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:13,560
the trans community, mentioning gender dysphoria and pronouns, including the claim that trans

798
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:17,880
people are trying to make it illegal to use the wrong pronouns, even though actually it's them

799
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:23,000
who have the pronouns wrong. This began to receive some serious pushback, especially from some of his

800
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:27,080
trans followers who are particularly enthusiastic about Minecraft, with one sharing a pro-trans

801
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:31,640
message in a My Little Pony format stating that trans women are women. Notch didn't appreciate

802
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:35,560
that, and quote tweeted the person stating that they were wrong, and although trans women were

803
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:40,360
deserving of support as much as anyone else, that anyone advocating for this position was evil,

804
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:46,040
and feeding into a dangerous mentally ill delusion, using his sister's body dysmorphia as an example.

805
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:49,640
When further challenged on this, it seems he's more concerned about the authoritarian nature

806
01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:53,720
of many people to quote demand that they be addressed by specific pronouns. He stands his

807
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:57,800
ground, states that it is illegal in many places already, and agree with another tweet that if they

808
01:00:57,800 --> 01:01:02,120
do this unquestionably they will also be walking back women's rights, seemingly adopting a more

809
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:06,600
trans-exclusionary radical feminist standpoint. Now, I do not know the law in every country or

810
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:10,920
region, but the fact that Notch did not seem to cite any sources or even anecdotal content made

811
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:14,680
these claims rather hard to work with, and when being asked what this all was about he commented

812
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:18,600
the Great Awakening, which is another event commonly referenced on QAnon where the greater

813
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:22,120
population becomes aware of the truth, Notch seemed to be framing his tweets from the lens

814
01:01:22,120 --> 01:01:26,600
that he was punching up against an oppressive regime, but many people didn't seem to agree.

815
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:29,800
Although it was true that certain industries were striving towards greater diversity,

816
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:33,880
many didn't think it was really at the request of any specific demographic. It was more just a

817
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:37,720
financially intelligent thing to do to give products greater appeal, as the number of people

818
01:01:37,720 --> 01:01:41,960
in certain groups outnumbered the people who were annoyed by these groups' existence. As someone who

819
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:46,120
made a game whose whole existence can be defined by the individual, and as a person who emphasised

820
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:50,280
that in the past, this shouldn't be new information to Notch, but he came to the conclusion that this

821
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:55,240
time it was state mandated. However, in the end it just seemed like he was targeting a group of

822
01:01:55,240 --> 01:02:00,680
people, whereas misinformation could be making targets out of them. It seemed that as time passed,

823
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:02,680
he was growing only more conspiratorial.

824
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:13,720
Throughout most of March, Notch continued to back its position unapologetically, responding in an

825
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:17,640
increasingly blasé manner to those who showed hostility to them, and if there was any doubt

826
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:21,240
about it you could just look at his bio, which contained a link to the website where Q would

827
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:25,640
regularly post. Safe to say, Notch was definitely testing the patience of those who didn't hold his

828
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:30,600
beliefs and still associated with him, most notably Munkraft itself. The person's recent

829
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:34,760
turn to conspiracy theories had almost locked him in a self-inflicted cycle. As he became more and

830
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:38,760
more extreme, fewer and fewer people felt truly comfortable with his ideas, and consequently

831
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:43,240
probably weren't as keen to entertain his presence. Notch observed this and embraced his alienation.

832
01:02:43,240 --> 01:02:47,320
He's been an outcast before, and he was ready to be an outcast again, likely attributing part of the

833
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:50,840
reason to the fact that they couldn't handle him speaking the truth. Many of these people would

834
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:55,240
probably be in on it as well. In 2019 though, after the string of tweets we've just covered,

835
01:02:55,240 --> 01:03:00,040
Microsoft began to decouple their casual, if still meaningful, relationship. It first began

836
01:03:00,040 --> 01:03:03,720
with the simple removal of references to him in the loading screen. This seemed to be rather

837
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:08,120
insignificant on the surface, however up to this point it was extremely rare for any splash text

838
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:13,000
to be erased, only happening a handful of times in Minecraft's lifespan. At the time, many suspected

839
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:17,240
this to be related to the incidents analysed in the previous part, however Microsoft refused to

840
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:20,920
comment on the matter, and ultimately this was deemed rather trivial. However, there was another

841
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:24,920
event round the corner that would test Microsoft's position on the matter, that being the 10th

842
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:29,880
anniversary of Minecraft's publication to the internet. It made sense that Notch wasn't involved

843
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:34,040
with the public image of Minecraft as it was, but at the end of the day, without him, Minecraft

844
01:03:34,040 --> 01:03:38,120
wouldn't exist, and the 10th anniversary was a celebration of just that. By not commenting on the

845
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:41,880
removal of the splash text that credits him, Microsoft had the choice open so they wouldn't

846
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:45,880
seem hypocritical if they did invite him, however barely a month after it seems they had made

847
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:49,880
a decision that he would not be included in the landmark festival for all things Minecraft,

848
01:03:49,880 --> 01:03:53,800
with the spokesperson telling the press, his comments and opinions do not reflect those of

849
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:58,440
Microsoft or Mojang and are not representative of Minecraft. Notch didn't seem to make any public

850
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:02,840
comment himself, he moved on to playing the game Factorio, he seemed to be having fun with it at

851
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:07,000
least. In the run up to the event he made a couple vague posts here and there which were hard to

852
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:11,240
interpret, but on the day of the anniversary he put out a single tweet reading, Happy Birthday,

853
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:16,840
smiley face. It reached almost 30,000 likes, which is far more than any of his previous argumentative

854
01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:19,880
tweets had reached, and in these moments of wholesomeness you almost forget what he was

855
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:24,280
tweeting barely a couple months before. In a way, Minecraft's decision was probably in the best

856
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:28,040
interests of everyone, if Notch still held his beliefs pretty ardently at this point, I'm sure

857
01:04:28,040 --> 01:04:31,960
he probably saw his exclusion as a badge of honour above anything else. If you believe in that sort

858
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:36,680
of satanic cabal, Microsoft is definitely a part of it, however I think Notch likely had a different

859
01:04:36,680 --> 01:04:40,600
viewpoint that could be illuminated by a few tweets. Although not commenting on his exclusion

860
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:44,360
from the anniversary event, Notch did briefly comment on Microsoft removing the in-game

861
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:48,680
references to him. After expressing regret for something assumedly relating to his position on

862
01:04:48,680 --> 01:04:53,000
trans people, he responds to a comment to someone saying that Minecraft removing references to him

863
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:57,560
may be a way to help him process what he had been saying and doing. This comment seems to demonstrate

864
01:04:57,560 --> 01:05:01,720
some contrition for his recent antics, and seemingly accepts his fate for whatever happens

865
01:05:01,720 --> 01:05:06,760
next. People had additionally started a movement to recognise Hatsune Miku as the creator of

866
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:11,320
Minecraft, and Notch appeared to take it on the chin, stating that letting go is key. It's hard to

867
01:05:11,320 --> 01:05:15,720
retell where Notch stood on his comments, as he neither issued a formal retraction, or reassertion

868
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:19,560
following them. He seemed to regret how he'd phrased it himself, and that he had hurt people,

869
01:05:19,560 --> 01:05:24,040
but didn't elaborate on whether he stood by his opinions. Regardless, he seemed to accept that

870
01:05:24,040 --> 01:05:29,080
where he was, and where Minecraft was, were not the same place, and for that much, he was right,

871
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:33,400
they weren't. Over the following year, he mostly refrained from talking politics directly,

872
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:37,320
the occasional comment about Trump or Hillary, but ones that were not too hard to read into.

873
01:05:37,320 --> 01:05:41,160
I honestly find a fair few of his tweets hard to completely understand sometimes, and his use of

874
01:05:41,160 --> 01:05:45,080
the word evil seems to have lost its meaning, to be honest. There was a hoax that he had passed away

875
01:05:45,080 --> 01:05:49,000
from a drug overdose, which was obviously not true, I think it once again likely arose from

876
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:53,240
someone who was probably not a fan, but it was quickly debunked given that Notch was still firing

877
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:57,080
off tweets every other hour. Although it was safe to say that Notch had been less provocative than

878
01:05:57,080 --> 01:06:00,840
he had been, he was still quite loud with his opinions when he chose to be, he still gave off

879
01:06:00,840 --> 01:06:04,600
the energy of one of those people who says they're not being political, but they clearly

880
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:10,120
are at points. In August of 2020, a YouTuber by the name of Game Maker's Toolkit decided to try

881
01:06:10,120 --> 01:06:13,880
and run some ads on their channel. They posted their conclusion on their twitter and referenced

882
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:18,520
certain re-election ads from Mr Trump. Notch, seemingly displeased with this comment, requested

883
01:06:18,520 --> 01:06:23,720
them to drop the politics, which GMTK said they would if Notch in return deleted his twitter

884
01:06:23,720 --> 01:06:29,000
account. Surprisingly, the person decided to agree. GMTK took down their tweet, and Notch took

885
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:33,640
down his account, taking the world back to the blissful days before people cared about who their

886
01:06:33,640 --> 01:06:37,880
president was and that crap. Except a few days later Notch came back, explained that he was worried

887
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:42,280
someone would claim his name tag so had to do it for security reasons, and at that point just felt

888
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:46,840
he had to start tweeting anyway, which doesn't make much sense, but his return to twitter couldn't be

889
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:51,400
a surprise. I think it's fair to observe the fact that although many tweets covered in the last

890
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:55,480
couple parts obviously did generate controversy amongst communities, they didn't really attract

891
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:59,640
too much attention from those outside the immediate sphere. A few articles and responses,

892
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:04,200
but otherwise it was pretty quiet. You have to be an avid follower of the industry to notice.

893
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:08,280
Notch never really farmed the attention that he was receiving, when most celebrities go rogue they

894
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:12,520
at least take an interview slot on Tucker Carson or something. Notch never seemed to sacrifice his

895
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:17,160
hatred of public life for publicity of his opinions, amongst many he was still that guy who

896
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:21,160
made the game that their kids play, and they still heralded him from the era that had him as one of

897
01:07:21,160 --> 01:07:25,400
the most powerful people in the world. It's likely why Microsoft was so hesitant to drop him,

898
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:29,480
but eventually they realised that their name attached to an article could yield a bit more

899
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:34,760
cares, especially if Notch said something ill timed at the event, prospectively poisoning sales.

900
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:38,920
Ultimately the benefits of hosting someone like Notch, who had no technical connection to Minecraft

901
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:45,320
in its then present form, did not outweigh the drawbacks, and thus the disconnect was complete.

902
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:46,520
But what was left behind?

903
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:54,600
Now you're mostly up to date, the year is whatever it is right now, who bloody knows,

904
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:59,640
and Notch has mostly faded into the ether, which given the current escalating political climate

905
01:07:59,640 --> 01:08:04,280
is probably for the best. As said, many do likely not know about all the antics over the previous

906
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:08,440
years, some probably hate him for it, a few probably think he's based, but I wonder how he

907
01:08:08,440 --> 01:08:13,640
feels after all. The person who was previously so open about his feelings has become quite quiet,

908
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:17,720
his twitter mostly observations now, with the occasional tweet of affection to those still

909
01:08:17,720 --> 01:08:22,440
there. You can't help but wonder when looking back at his career if he thinks it was all worth it.

910
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:26,840
Person occupies this strange position of having so much, yet having so little. With a money and

911
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:31,160
lack of commitment he really had to anyone or anything, he became this social media drifter,

912
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:35,320
just kinda coasting from one topic to the next without any real continuity, free to speak his

913
01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:40,440
mind without proper material consequence, emphasis on material. Meanwhile though, the spoils of being

914
01:08:40,440 --> 01:08:44,680
a popular figure had dried up as soon as he'd ventured down the conspiratorial path. Although

915
01:08:44,680 --> 01:08:48,200
Microsoft were the only people to officially cut ties with him, there were likely many other

916
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:52,360
opportunities that didn't present themselves due to these comments. Companies, conventions,

917
01:08:52,360 --> 01:08:56,200
associates would likely see him as a liability, and where some people might actually care about

918
01:08:56,200 --> 01:08:59,960
their reputation with Microsoft ending their association with him, Notch just seemed to

919
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:04,200
accept that he had made his bet, but acceptance doesn't equate to happiness. I think a lot of

920
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:08,600
people felt a sort of confusion as to what exactly led us to this scenario, and to be honest it is

921
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:12,840
understandable. The first thing when analysing a person's behaviour is often to search for motive,

922
01:09:12,840 --> 01:09:17,240
to find some discernible cause, and a cursory look at Notch's background and existence wouldn't really

923
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:20,360
point to anything that would lead to such behaviour, particularly given that most people

924
01:09:20,360 --> 01:09:24,920
knew him from Minecraft, and what it represented to them. Throughout much of his lifespan,

925
01:09:24,920 --> 01:09:29,080
Minecraft garnered a significant audience who didn't necessarily fit into traditional societal

926
01:09:29,080 --> 01:09:33,080
norms, and that wasn't necessarily a surprise given that the guy who created it also didn't

927
01:09:33,080 --> 01:09:36,920
when he was growing up. Loads of people played Minecraft, likely many with extremely diverse

928
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:40,760
backgrounds and political views, and it never possessed a specific identity per se,

929
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:44,760
but over the years it garnered a reputation as probably the most inclusive and accessible games

930
01:09:44,760 --> 01:09:48,440
of modern history. Probably a good example of this is how it benefited the social skills of

931
01:09:48,440 --> 01:09:52,520
many who have lacked them otherwise. Minecraft has been shown to really aid children who experience

932
01:09:52,520 --> 01:09:56,520
certain neurodevelopmental conditions such as autism, with many parents singing their praises

933
01:09:56,520 --> 01:10:00,600
of the game's transformative effect for their loved ones, finding a community and escape that

934
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:04,680
actually helps them be more comfortable in their own skin. In the last few decades society has

935
01:10:04,680 --> 01:10:08,440
become increasingly aware and sensitive to those who encounter such conditions, and the social

936
01:10:08,440 --> 01:10:11,960
challenges that they may have to traverse as a result of it. While many regular social

937
01:10:11,960 --> 01:10:15,800
environments were still learning to evolve to the needs of those who may or may not thrive in those

938
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:19,800
places, Minecraft was already there, and I don't think that was restricted to any specific

939
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:23,960
demographic. I think it's also applied to many marginalised LGBT individuals, particularly those

940
01:10:23,960 --> 01:10:28,280
in the trans community who found solacing a game where your entire life is essentially customisable.

941
01:10:28,280 --> 01:10:31,960
It's not just an escape from the real world, it's the entrance to a completely different one.

942
01:10:31,960 --> 01:10:36,120
We discussed how a game can often represent its creator, and Minecraft represented a place that

943
01:10:36,120 --> 01:10:40,040
remedied people who experienced the often isolating life growing up that Notch did.

944
01:10:40,040 --> 01:10:44,040
That's a principle that doesn't end on the basis of personal identity, and therefore if anyone was

945
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:47,960
going to understand the contemporary struggle of marginalised groups to fit in with society,

946
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:51,720
it should have been him right? Even if you believe that there wasn't any relationship between the

947
01:10:51,720 --> 01:10:55,640
creator and his game, even if perhaps people projected too much of the game onto the creator,

948
01:10:55,640 --> 01:10:59,160
it wasn't like Notch was ever vocal about any views that would contradict this image.

949
01:10:59,160 --> 01:11:02,280
On the contrary, in fact, as I've already documented, the dude announced that every

950
01:11:02,280 --> 01:11:05,720
character is genderless, and even facetiously claimed that that made them all gay,

951
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:10,120
thus owning the homophobes. He didn't seem to have much respect for traditional gamer toxicity,

952
01:11:10,120 --> 01:11:14,520
criticising tropes such as calling someone gay as weird attempts at insults, and said that although

953
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:18,840
he hadn't been attracted to a man, he tried to keep an open mind, and he's pretty cuddly.

954
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:22,680
After he was informed that a Kickstarter he'd promoted was started by someone who

955
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:27,400
seemingly helped homophobic views, he expressed disappointment, and said people should be sane.

956
01:11:27,480 --> 01:11:31,240
At a time where video game companies often stayed out of debates surrounding political issues,

957
01:11:31,240 --> 01:11:35,720
Notch's opinions on issues affecting marginalised communities always felt authentic. These days,

958
01:11:35,720 --> 01:11:39,240
it's often hard to tell which companies are actually interested in advancing the rights

959
01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:42,840
of those they claim to care about, and those who are just playing to the crowd as they always have.

960
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:46,680
You could probably say that disingenuous support is better than none at all, but sometimes you also

961
01:11:46,680 --> 01:11:50,200
want to know who's not going to throw your rights under the bus when it's no longer profitable to

962
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:54,120
them. Notch seemed like that guy, people might claim he was just being politically correct back

963
01:11:54,120 --> 01:11:58,200
when he had an audience to commit to, but I'd say all evidence suggests otherwise. As a guy

964
01:11:58,200 --> 01:12:02,360
whose success wasn't concerned by PR or even dependent on the game's sales, Notch was free

965
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:06,280
to take whatever positions that he wished to, and he did take many in a time where they weren't

966
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:10,680
necessarily widespread. His views on issues like piracy and big tech were considered different

967
01:12:10,680 --> 01:12:14,760
for their time in that industry, particularly when it was out of step with big tech itself.

968
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:18,520
He was the anti-establishment figure whose success inadvertently tore up the status quo.

969
01:12:18,520 --> 01:12:22,440
The establishment's position on such matters has always been to predominantly follow popular

970
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:26,680
opinion or play to the largest present market. Notch was never like that, and his game didn't

971
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:30,760
conform to those boundaries either which is what made it such a success. I'm sure for many people

972
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:34,680
who didn't identify with the traditional brand of gamer, Minecraft was their introduction to

973
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:38,680
video games as a whole. I think that's what made his outburst on the matter of transgender rights

974
01:12:38,680 --> 01:12:42,360
the breaking point for corporate relations. Despite the numerous concerning statements

975
01:12:42,360 --> 01:12:46,440
prior, Notch had created this game based on principles that he seemed to advocate for

976
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:50,360
before brutally turning on. It's not out of the question for people to change their opinions that

977
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:54,360
much is true, but this just didn't make sense with what he'd created before. I don't think

978
01:12:54,360 --> 01:12:57,880
anyone ever saw these tweets as a grift, he didn't have anything to gain from his actions,

979
01:12:57,880 --> 01:13:01,400
and didn't seem to want to gain anything from them. On the other hand, looking at the evidence,

980
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:05,080
I don't think you can say he was being dishonest or corporate with his views before, I don't think

981
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:09,960
selling his share in Minecraft necessarily freed his opinions anymore, but how can we reconcile

982
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:14,520
two parts of an individual's life that seem so contradictory? Maybe we need to get into his shoes

983
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:30,680
a little more. When analysing two apparently contradictory patterns of thoughtful behaviour,

984
01:13:30,680 --> 01:13:34,280
sometimes it's important to look at the wider picture and causes, and how they may have

985
01:13:34,280 --> 01:13:38,040
interacted with each other. With Notch, I think the clues to understanding his about-turn in

986
01:13:38,040 --> 01:13:42,120
political positions can be defined by a few constants and variables that impacted his

987
01:13:42,120 --> 01:13:45,800
previously rather innocent worldview. So let's talk about some of these factors.

988
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:49,720
The most important factor is that of community. I think if there's one thing that matters to Notch,

989
01:13:49,720 --> 01:13:53,640
it's community. It's a complicated aspect of video game creation that he wrangled with for

990
01:13:53,640 --> 01:13:57,480
much of his career, but although he wasn't always a media darling, and often definitely took pride

991
01:13:57,480 --> 01:14:01,080
in having some sort of control in the direction of his projects, he definitely valued the input

992
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:05,240
from those around him, particularly those who actually sampled his output. This began the

993
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:09,160
community of indie developers, some of whom he would go on to work with in creating Minecraft.

994
01:14:09,160 --> 01:14:12,840
He would regularly post his projects and interact with other developments, providing feedback and

995
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:17,160
accepting it for his own works. It's not a surprise that in spite of the game's traction outside the

996
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:21,320
forums, the person remained active there on his account until the end of 2010, continuing to

997
01:14:21,320 --> 01:14:25,480
discuss Minecraft and general gaming matters with other budding developers. This was a similar

998
01:14:25,480 --> 01:14:28,840
pattern with his audience, although it was difficult to necessarily orchestrate a close

999
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:33,080
relationship with your user base, Notch did his best, using a combination of Twitter and Tumblr

1000
01:14:33,080 --> 01:14:37,240
to provide a balance between informal expressions of personal opinion and official announcements.

1001
01:14:37,240 --> 01:14:41,240
He enjoyed attending conferences and interacting with fans, being a part of something so much

1002
01:14:41,240 --> 01:14:46,040
greater gave him a sense of purpose. Person also reaped the benefits of a tight-knit workforce in

1003
01:14:46,040 --> 01:14:49,960
the company that he founded, maintaining the total number of staff under 50 during his tenure at the

1004
01:14:49,960 --> 01:14:54,440
business. Notch reportedly held a strong personal camaraderie with his employees. Mojang's office

1005
01:14:54,440 --> 01:14:58,280
was based on the design of a regular home, and filled to the brim with amenities. Workers would

1006
01:14:58,280 --> 01:15:02,520
be treated to lucrative bonuses, and company trips involving the entire workforce would be made to

1007
01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:07,000
luxurious spots to celebrate the game's continued prosperity. Community mattered to Minecraft,

1008
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:11,000
as a grassroots game with no investors, it was what kept the game untethered and unimpeded by

1009
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:14,920
ulterior interests, and if it mattered to Minecraft, it mattered to Marcus. I think the

1010
01:15:14,920 --> 01:15:19,080
enjoyment of community resulted from the fact that Notch assumed the role of a working-class

1011
01:15:19,080 --> 01:15:22,840
hero of sorts, a lot of people from this sort of background could have easily let the spoils of

1012
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:26,600
stardust come to them, it almost had the opposite effect on Person, who seemed determined to

1013
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:31,720
demonstrate his allegiance to the everyday gamer. It should be no secret, Notch liked to be liked.

1014
01:15:32,280 --> 01:15:35,960
I don't think this core set of beliefs ever deserted him, however as the circumstances

1015
01:15:35,960 --> 01:15:40,520
surrounding his popularity evolved, his position and that of others influenced his perspectives

1016
01:15:40,520 --> 01:15:45,160
on said communities. As his fanbase grew, his activity on the developer's forum quietened down,

1017
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:49,000
the increase in gulf between him and those who enjoyed the game also expanded. In spite of the

1018
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:53,400
claims he was acting the user's best interests, the situation regarding in-game transactions

1019
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:57,480
ultimately broke him because people alleged he was prioritising corporate interests,

1020
01:15:57,480 --> 01:16:01,080
something that clearly upset him so much that he decided to sell his shares.

1021
01:16:01,080 --> 01:16:05,160
Think about it for a moment, one of the most successful figures in the video game industry

1022
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:09,640
sold the shares to his company because he was upset at what people online were saying.

1023
01:16:09,640 --> 01:16:13,560
This may have solved one issue, but it opened up another after many of its staff seemed dissatisfied

1024
01:16:13,560 --> 01:16:17,960
with the outcome of the deal. This was a guy who had turned down any and all investors up until

1025
01:16:17,960 --> 01:16:21,960
this point, and although he did secure protections and bonuses for many of his employees, the

1026
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:26,360
principal of going with something he'd previously opposed, ferociously too seemed to hurt them.

1027
01:16:26,360 --> 01:16:30,200
In many ways he gained a lot, but he'd lost what mattered to him for so long, and with the

1028
01:16:30,200 --> 01:16:33,880
increased distance between him and the surrounding world, he gradually grew more listless and

1029
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:38,440
languid. Eventually he was left with no community, nobody to properly identify with, and it wasn't

1030
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:41,800
like the wealth was the inherent root of the problem, but it was the result of decisions

1031
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:45,720
that inevitably isolated him from a lot of people. He wanted to rid himself of the crippling

1032
01:16:45,720 --> 01:16:50,120
responsibilities that had come with being part of these communities, but had nothing to fill it with

1033
01:16:50,120 --> 01:16:53,480
until the internet began to move in a different direction, a more political one.

1034
01:16:54,440 --> 01:16:56,520
Like that's ever gonna happen.

1035
01:16:56,520 --> 01:17:00,680
Politics is something that many people understandably avoid, but it's also something that many people

1036
01:17:00,680 --> 01:17:04,360
can be sucked into, particularly if they have nothing better to do than firing up the old blue

1037
01:17:04,360 --> 01:17:08,200
bird and picking the first hot take that rubs others the wrong way. Not to have been outspoken

1038
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:12,120
on many of his political opinions, but never seem to attach too much meaning to it personally,

1039
01:17:12,120 --> 01:17:17,240
but as a perpetually bored person looking for a cause to latch onto, what happened in 2016 was the

1040
01:17:17,240 --> 01:17:21,080
perfect catalyst. The campaign and subsequent election of Donald Trump, and the reaction from

1041
01:17:21,160 --> 01:17:25,080
mainstream sources to much of his behaviour sparked a backlash amongst many on the internet,

1042
01:17:25,080 --> 01:17:29,240
not necessarily because people identified with him particularly, to be frank he wasn't very

1043
01:17:29,240 --> 01:17:33,240
related, but because they saw him as a sort of symbol in an enduring culture war against people

1044
01:17:33,240 --> 01:17:37,480
who wished to restrict online freedoms that had long been enjoyed by those who had used it.

1045
01:17:37,480 --> 01:17:41,480
Trump hated the establishment, big tech, and many of the organisations that Notch had rallied

1046
01:17:41,480 --> 01:17:45,560
against in the past, even though I'd say Trump had very different gripes to someone like Notch,

1047
01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:49,880
as an influential person his cause was enough, and in a way it was the resistance that provoked

1048
01:17:49,880 --> 01:18:11,160
people. It's also important to note that a lot of mainstream businesses that had long been

1049
01:18:11,160 --> 01:18:15,080
apolitical in many ways became outspoken on certain social issues that Trump was thought

1050
01:18:15,080 --> 01:18:19,080
to possibly hold power over, particularly given their increasing prominence on social media,

1051
01:18:19,080 --> 01:18:22,680
and the new generation using it who were somewhat more progressive in their viewpoints.

1052
01:18:22,680 --> 01:18:26,600
I think this sort of corporate movement probably alarmed someone like Notch, as to him they always

1053
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:31,320
seem like the bellwether of cynical self-serving opinions, and sometimes the enemy of your enemy

1054
01:18:31,320 --> 01:18:35,800
is your friend. This is what started it at least, although he had mostly avoided taking positions

1055
01:18:35,800 --> 01:18:40,040
in past controversies and even larger scale situations, something about defending internet

1056
01:18:40,040 --> 01:18:44,360
culture seemed to galvanise him, as that guy who essentially had his career launched by the online

1057
01:18:44,360 --> 01:18:48,680
world, he was obviously going to be defensive of his characteristics that enabled his success.

1058
01:18:48,680 --> 01:18:53,080
After selling his shares he had lost his cause and community, but a new one was emerging,

1059
01:18:53,080 --> 01:18:57,560
one where he was part of the last line against a culture that could sterilise everything that made

1060
01:18:57,560 --> 01:19:03,000
it great. However, that still doesn't fully explain how we go from this, to this. There's

1061
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:07,000
still a degree of disconnect, well, it wasn't a solo effort.

1062
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:16,840
Intro

1063
01:19:16,840 --> 01:19:21,000
To understand the final stage of Notch's rabbit hole of conspiratorial behaviour, you have to

1064
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:25,240
understand the conspiracies behind it, and how they took their grasp on corners of the internet.

1065
01:19:25,240 --> 01:19:29,880
The American political world was certainly being shaken up in 2016, and it's not hard to understand

1066
01:19:29,880 --> 01:19:34,200
why. Many people have made the valid observation there was a huge gulf between those in government,

1067
01:19:34,200 --> 01:19:38,120
the media, large corporations, and practically everyone else. Many Americans saw their lives

1068
01:19:38,120 --> 01:19:42,280
going nowhere, and they wanted something that could give them a purpose. I already spoke about

1069
01:19:42,280 --> 01:19:45,880
the connection between hating the establishment and loving someone like Trump, but the Forum of

1070
01:19:45,880 --> 01:19:50,600
QAnon took that idea one step further, and vied this elaborate explanation for everything occurring,

1071
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:54,920
rooted in this idea that Donald Trump was the person to overhaul the broken system as we know it,

1072
01:19:54,920 --> 01:19:59,800
and bring the power abusing elite to justice. It took off because it targeted a certain demographic

1073
01:19:59,800 --> 01:20:04,040
of Americans who felt taken for granted by those in charge, it provided an explanation that played

1074
01:20:04,040 --> 01:20:08,200
into that moral black and white sort of thinking, presented people with a clear villain, a hero,

1075
01:20:08,200 --> 01:20:12,360
and a purpose to actually support. Person wasn't like many people part of this movement though,

1076
01:20:12,360 --> 01:20:16,600
firstly he wasn't American, he spent a fair amount of time there, but if everything did go to the

1077
01:20:16,600 --> 01:20:21,160
dogs he could easily just go back to his cushy residence in Stockholm. Person also wasn't someone

1078
01:20:21,160 --> 01:20:25,080
who was disenfranchised at that point, he lived a life of relative privilege, of course it was

1079
01:20:25,080 --> 01:20:29,160
roots from his own product, but it wasn't like he had anything to resent about his current lifestyle

1080
01:20:29,160 --> 01:20:33,320
at its core. At some points in conversation he had mentioned the financial aspects of American

1081
01:20:33,320 --> 01:20:37,160
politics which may lead some people to thinking he had ulterior motives, however he didn't have

1082
01:20:37,160 --> 01:20:41,080
any business interest in grifting because he'd sold them all, and these opinions probably cost

1083
01:20:41,080 --> 01:20:45,000
him a lot more in actual opportunities. Even many of those on the right avoided the realms

1084
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:49,400
of QAnon because of how it was based mostly in speculation, for many people such a site was the

1085
01:20:49,400 --> 01:20:53,320
most unattractive setting of ideas to subscribe to. There's little doubt that Notch's tweets were

1086
01:20:53,320 --> 01:20:57,960
not designed to reap the words of those agreed with him, so what was it? First let's talk about

1087
01:20:57,960 --> 01:21:01,560
the sense of purpose that appealed to someone like Notch, who had clearly been understimulated

1088
01:21:01,560 --> 01:21:05,320
for too long by the world around him. We already knew that he had sympathies towards Trump in life

1089
01:21:05,320 --> 01:21:09,320
the position he occupied in much of the media, and the culture war that was occurring online.

1090
01:21:09,320 --> 01:21:13,480
QAnon elevated this idea of a culture war to fantastical levels, and made everyone who was

1091
01:21:13,480 --> 01:21:17,640
a part of it feel like a soldier for a cause that underscored the fabric of society. To many

1092
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:22,040
outsiders it seemed so dangerously far-fetched, that's what made it exciting in the eyes of those

1093
01:21:22,040 --> 01:21:26,040
who were actually there. It could easily be the plot to a dystopian video game where you're the

1094
01:21:26,040 --> 01:21:30,120
resistance against a worldwide cannibalistic cabal. There are plenty of conspiracy theories

1095
01:21:30,120 --> 01:21:34,520
online, but this one had a plot and a finale, one where everyone who stood with the people against

1096
01:21:34,520 --> 01:21:39,000
the powers would be rewarded. Although it's just my perspective, I think Notch emotionally connected

1097
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:43,560
with that, we're already aware of how seriously he took these issues. There is one more aspect

1098
01:21:43,560 --> 01:21:46,920
about a lot of these radical causes that often brings people together though, and that is the

1099
01:21:46,920 --> 01:21:51,000
absence of judgement between many people involved in these movements. Notch had clearly struggled to

1100
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:55,080
find community after selling his share in Mojang, particularly given that he was a paranoid person

1101
01:21:55,080 --> 01:21:59,000
and didn't trust many in his own life, especially now that there could be superficial motives to

1102
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:02,760
befriending him. He seemed to genuinely believe that most of the high society that he was part of

1103
01:22:02,760 --> 01:22:07,080
was corrupt and self-serving, sometimes seeming to long for more organic connections. I think the

1104
01:22:07,080 --> 01:22:10,520
problem with the real world is that when you become such a well-known figure your reputation

1105
01:22:10,520 --> 01:22:13,720
precedes you, and you don't get the chance to make first impressions because they've already

1106
01:22:13,720 --> 01:22:18,520
been made through publicity and media. By existing in online, often anonymous spaces, Notch probably

1107
01:22:18,520 --> 01:22:23,480
rediscovered a sense of community that transcended his existence outside of those real-world circles.

1108
01:22:23,480 --> 01:22:27,320
Notch enjoyed the forums of 4chan because he believed that it was people at their most honest

1109
01:22:27,320 --> 01:22:31,000
and unfiltered, but also a lot of what united people was just the fact that they could be

1110
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:35,240
themselves. QAnon was more than that though, as a cause that provided an unquestioning community

1111
01:22:35,240 --> 01:22:40,360
for all those who united under its banner, a real us versus them, something where who you were came

1112
01:22:40,360 --> 01:22:45,080
secondary to everything else, and to hell to those who doubted you. For a lot of people this becomes

1113
01:22:45,080 --> 01:22:49,320
a very damaging cycle though, because the more divisive a conspiracy theory, the more it might

1114
01:22:49,320 --> 01:22:53,720
actually affect personal interactions. A lot of people believed if you followed QAnon then you

1115
01:22:53,720 --> 01:22:57,080
were just too delusional to even have a conversation with, so you could be distanced

1116
01:22:57,080 --> 01:23:01,240
from people completely and left with like-minded people who may not be the most beneficial to your

1117
01:23:01,240 --> 01:23:06,360
well-being. The other problem is that QAnon possessed what I would call explicable dissonance,

1118
01:23:06,360 --> 01:23:10,760
a concept common to a lot of conspiracy theories that provides an explanation for why outsiders

1119
01:23:10,760 --> 01:23:15,080
may expound otherwise logical reputations of the core doctrine in question. These sorts of

1120
01:23:15,080 --> 01:23:20,360
dismissals assign ignorance, brainwashing, and the very common idea that all will be revealed soon

1121
01:23:20,360 --> 01:23:24,840
to discredit critiques of QAnon's proposed dogma. People have turned their nose up at it, but it's

1122
01:23:24,840 --> 01:23:30,200
a powerful logical bind, albeit fallacious. QAnon did appeal to many disenfranchised people,

1123
01:23:30,200 --> 01:23:33,880
but it also appealed to individuals who were starved of some form of purpose in life or

1124
01:23:33,880 --> 01:23:38,520
community, things that every person really needs to feel emotionally fulfilled. A lot of old Q's

1125
01:23:38,520 --> 01:23:42,360
predictions ended up not occurring, and at any point these could be signalled to bring the

1126
01:23:42,360 --> 01:23:46,280
credibility of such a figure into question, but the truth was the cause was greater than

1127
01:23:46,280 --> 01:23:51,160
even the verity of any individual claim. Ideology came before anything else, even sometimes the

1128
01:23:51,160 --> 01:23:55,560
lives and well-being of those who were actually part of the movement, some would rather be a martyr

1129
01:23:55,560 --> 01:23:59,880
for the cause. These communities also became very insular, when you surround yourself with people

1130
01:23:59,880 --> 01:24:04,440
who only see things one way, you're very susceptible to succumbing to those perspectives, even if

1131
01:24:04,440 --> 01:24:09,000
otherwise in a normal environment you would dismiss them. Although Notch did not express his support

1132
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:13,480
for the movement until 2019, the fact that he was promoting Pizzagate theories barely a few months

1133
01:24:13,480 --> 01:24:17,640
before QAnon was founded shows the sort of places that he was frequenting, but I think more

1134
01:24:17,640 --> 01:24:22,360
indicative was how he went about it. In his tweets, Person didn't seem to have a clear thought process

1135
01:24:22,360 --> 01:24:27,240
behind exactly why these things were legit, he regularly appeared to contradict himself and seemed

1136
01:24:27,240 --> 01:24:32,120
panicked and confused, even manic to a degree. Notch always saw himself as a man of the people,

1137
01:24:32,120 --> 01:24:36,440
a guy who was fighting against the establishment, and in a way QAnon presented itself as that too.

1138
01:24:36,440 --> 01:24:40,680
That was the entry point, but once you're in you're introduced to a lot of new ideas that build onto

1139
01:24:40,680 --> 01:24:43,640
each other, and eventually you're hooked on something greater than that and you're in a bubble

1140
01:24:43,640 --> 01:24:47,640
where you won't even listen to anything else outside of it. It's a chain reaction to what those

1141
01:24:47,640 --> 01:24:52,200
Florida tweets could easily be the result of, and in many cases was honestly one of the milder

1142
01:24:52,200 --> 01:24:57,320
results. The moral gravitas placed onto QAnon theories makes that fantasy very very real for

1143
01:24:57,320 --> 01:25:02,280
some people, and it has led to tragedy in multiple instances, with a subreddit even dedicated to

1144
01:25:02,280 --> 01:25:06,760
people whose friends and family members have been drawn in by those beliefs, many accounts describing

1145
01:25:06,760 --> 01:25:11,480
them as previously perfectly reasonable individuals. What many saw as a public outburst

1146
01:25:11,480 --> 01:25:15,480
in Notch's tweets was something that had long been building up behind the scenes, a product of

1147
01:25:15,480 --> 01:25:20,440
under-stimulation, wealth-induced paranoia, and existential emptiness, and ironically the desire

1148
01:25:20,440 --> 01:25:23,880
to be on the right side of history. But what will history say about him now?

1149
01:25:31,640 --> 01:25:35,400
At the start of the video, I invoked JK Rowling when talking about people who have become

1150
01:25:35,400 --> 01:25:39,880
controversial through their social media presence, however the one thing I would say about JK Rowling

1151
01:25:39,880 --> 01:25:44,920
is that she does have conviction with her beliefs, even if I believe they're wrong. For someone like

1152
01:25:44,920 --> 01:25:53,080
Notch, I feel there's a more relevant and recent example. This is Kanye West, a rapper and producer

1153
01:25:53,080 --> 01:25:57,480
whose music has been widely acclaimed for nearly two decades. His outspoken nature on political

1154
01:25:57,480 --> 01:26:01,560
issues garnered him a reputation for sure, but one that still commanded a level of respect for

1155
01:26:01,560 --> 01:26:05,320
its independence. However, that good faith offered to him has ultimately been put under

1156
01:26:05,320 --> 01:26:09,000
great strain in the wake of a plethora of anti-Semitic comments that do not even seek

1157
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:22,920
to disguise the dangerous connotations. Similarly with Notch, it was hard to work out exactly what

1158
01:26:22,920 --> 01:26:27,160
motivated Ye's sudden spiral into such unabashed backing of extreme beliefs, to the point where

1159
01:26:27,160 --> 01:26:31,000
some even question whether it was an intentional move to tank his career. Although I wouldn't go

1160
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:35,160
that far, I would say that a life where you have an abundance of resources but a lack of healthy

1161
01:26:35,160 --> 01:26:39,640
relationships can cause one to lash out in a way that antagonises those around you. There are many

1162
01:26:39,640 --> 01:26:43,720
ways of doing this, but turning to extreme beliefs is definitely one of them. It's an appeal to make

1163
01:26:43,720 --> 01:26:48,200
yourself as ugly as possible, challenge people to disown you, turn public opinion against you,

1164
01:26:48,200 --> 01:26:53,080
to change that superficiality. Both Kanye and Notch subscribed to beliefs that advocated this idea

1165
01:26:53,080 --> 01:26:56,760
that some elite class were fundamentally working against the interests of the people, and as

1166
01:26:56,760 --> 01:27:00,680
individuals who believed they were on the side of the underdog, what might seem like public meltdowns

1167
01:27:00,680 --> 01:27:05,400
to others seem like acts of personal and public resistance to them. It's a dangerous technique

1168
01:27:05,400 --> 01:27:09,400
though because you could easily just convert people to extreme beliefs, but sometimes people

1169
01:27:09,400 --> 01:27:13,080
don't think about that, especially when they feel like everything's already been said and done,

1170
01:27:13,080 --> 01:27:17,720
you feel like there's nothing else worthwhile left. We spoke about legacy, how one wishes to

1171
01:27:17,720 --> 01:27:22,200
be remembered after they're gone. It's a complicated conversation, because as much as the thought of

1172
01:27:22,200 --> 01:27:26,760
being revered by some around you may be alluring, you don't really have the privilege of living that

1173
01:27:26,760 --> 01:27:31,320
legacy. If you live your life for a legacy then you're not really doing it on your own terms,

1174
01:27:31,320 --> 01:27:35,800
for an artist sometimes it's about pursuing a personal vision first, even if those around you

1175
01:27:35,800 --> 01:27:40,440
don't necessarily approve. Notch's story isn't like that of many artists though, he's one of the

1176
01:27:40,440 --> 01:27:45,400
few people who has actually seen his legacy play out while he was still alive. Even public figures

1177
01:27:45,400 --> 01:27:49,080
who have been in broad in far more serious controversies seem to have some control over

1178
01:27:49,080 --> 01:27:53,560
the direction of their image, yet to many the conclusion for someone like Marcus Person had

1179
01:27:53,560 --> 01:27:57,320
already been written when he moved on from Minecraft. I'd argue there are many who still

1180
01:27:57,320 --> 01:28:01,160
probably have their thoughts dictated on the guy more from their opinion of his most famous

1181
01:28:01,160 --> 01:28:05,320
video game above anything else, despite the fact that he hasn't worked on it for a decade.

1182
01:28:05,320 --> 01:28:09,400
I think Notch was quietly aware of this, when being asked about his legacy he seemed to show

1183
01:28:09,400 --> 01:28:13,320
disregard for the idea, and although I'm not entirely sure I buy his dismissive attitude,

1184
01:28:13,320 --> 01:28:17,320
we'll get to that in a bit, I think he had to emotionally disconnect from it to an extent,

1185
01:28:17,320 --> 01:28:21,480
or else he would have been a relic in his own mind. There was no way to properly follow up a

1186
01:28:21,480 --> 01:28:26,360
game like Minecraft, a game so built on grassroots appeal, by the time that Notch acquired wealth and

1187
01:28:26,360 --> 01:28:31,000
fame he could never naturally replicate something so organic unless he created a whole new anonymous

1188
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:35,640
persona, crafting a magnum opus of such a scale at such a young age with nothing else publicly

1189
01:28:35,640 --> 01:28:40,520
notable under his belt, becoming a personality so intertwined with that work, when he walked away it

1190
01:28:40,520 --> 01:28:45,480
was a death of some sorts. The nature of what he did, essentially opting out of his career with

1191
01:28:45,480 --> 01:28:49,400
such final effect, giving him no commitment to anything and a massive paycheck that allowed him

1192
01:28:49,400 --> 01:28:53,480
to switch his life to sandbox mode. If life was a video game then Notch reached the end credits

1193
01:28:53,480 --> 01:28:54,920
before he even turned 40.

1194
01:28:54,920 --> 01:28:59,480
Notch- Right now I'm just, you know, buying houses in LA and partying.

1195
01:28:59,480 --> 01:29:03,160
But the thing about the sandbox is that it does grow tiresome, having everything at the tip of

1196
01:29:03,160 --> 01:29:06,920
your fingers can often do more harm than good, particularly when you're not a person who ever

1197
01:29:06,920 --> 01:29:11,480
really had a strong connection to the reward of the process. Notch wanted to fulfil this idea of

1198
01:29:11,480 --> 01:29:15,720
being a rich person, the next stage of his life, the way he spoke about it sometimes made it seem

1199
01:29:15,800 --> 01:29:20,200
like its own occupation, but the truth is that it's not a job, and the only perceptual upsides

1200
01:29:20,200 --> 01:29:24,360
of becoming a socialite was the public attention, something that person was vocal about not

1201
01:29:24,360 --> 01:29:29,560
necessarily enjoying. He wanted to be a part of something, but not the centre of it. In the end,

1202
01:29:29,560 --> 01:29:33,560
his prosperity merely made him even more distant and bitter than his work already left him,

1203
01:29:33,560 --> 01:29:37,400
occasionally externalising that angst online, and in spite of some people offering their support

1204
01:29:37,400 --> 01:29:41,720
or assistance, Big Snoop even offering a trip to the doggy den, eventually the new lifestyle

1205
01:29:41,720 --> 01:29:46,200
wore out its welcome. Notch was an individual who cared about that community and that vision,

1206
01:29:46,200 --> 01:29:50,760
but by the time the next cause to commit to came around, all he had was a fucked-up cache and some

1207
01:29:50,760 --> 01:29:55,160
social media presence. That sandbox began to transform into a straightjacket, a naturally

1208
01:29:55,160 --> 01:29:59,240
paranoid and unsettled person, he seemed to find new purpose in being outspoken and politically

1209
01:29:59,240 --> 01:30:03,000
inclined, but gradually it grew into a set of beliefs much more antithetical to the world he

1210
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:07,720
had previously created, who knows how long it was ultimately brewing. His tweets were a momentous

1211
01:30:07,720 --> 01:30:12,200
climax in their own regard, but almost as soon as he expounded the theories that drew the greatest

1212
01:30:12,200 --> 01:30:17,160
response he dropped them, never really addressing it, just kind of moving on. As is with the idea

1213
01:30:17,160 --> 01:30:21,560
with sacrificing your own public image, maybe Notch got what he wanted, the detachment from

1214
01:30:21,560 --> 01:30:25,560
the fear that his relationships were transactional, the ones who'll stick around in that scenario are

1215
01:30:25,560 --> 01:30:29,800
the ones who genuinely care about your well being. Unlike Kanye, he didn't seem to make any new

1216
01:30:29,800 --> 01:30:33,800
friends from his outburst nor did he end up on the Alex Jones show, but it still wasn't without

1217
01:30:33,880 --> 01:30:38,680
its bruising. Ultimately, it's not really rid him of the title of the creator of Minecraft,

1218
01:30:38,680 --> 01:30:43,080
just the title of the creator of Minecraft who then became a conspiracy theorist and racist,

1219
01:30:43,080 --> 01:30:47,560
and a fair few other isths. Although I'm sure he sleeps okay on whatever mattress a couple billion

1220
01:30:47,560 --> 01:30:52,200
can allow you to afford, there's still a lingering sadness that the outcome of years of hard work

1221
01:30:52,200 --> 01:30:57,080
was a name that many would rather forget, but still struggle to, and the bittersweet connotations

1222
01:30:57,080 --> 01:31:02,520
that come with the mention of it. He became a man both known for his best and worst moments,

1223
01:31:02,520 --> 01:31:07,160
and neither seemed to cancel each other out in people's minds. So what now?

1224
01:31:15,080 --> 01:31:18,920
I said Notch's Twitter has been pretty inoffensive over the past couple years,

1225
01:31:18,920 --> 01:31:23,720
which is largely true, but recently the original composer for the Minecraft soundtrack C418 decided

1226
01:31:23,720 --> 01:31:28,840
to put out a tweet expressing support for BLM and trans people, in light of a perceived rise in hate

1227
01:31:28,840 --> 01:31:34,280
speech. Notch in return decides to sarcastically reply, there we go, that should fix it, not

1228
01:31:34,280 --> 01:31:39,000
actively opposing the statement, but more snidely highlighting the futility of such a sentiment.

1229
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:43,160
And maybe he's not wrong, maybe a tweet won't largely make a difference, but you'd think that

1230
01:31:43,160 --> 01:31:47,640
the creator of Minecraft would be the first person to understand that great oaks can grow from small

1231
01:31:47,640 --> 01:31:52,120
acorns, and even if only one person's life is changed for the better from it, it's still better

1232
01:31:52,120 --> 01:31:56,600
than no change at all. Unfortunately though, I think it reflects the rather nihilistic worldview

1233
01:31:56,600 --> 01:32:01,320
that Notch has adopted in the past few years, one that didn't seem present before. I probably

1234
01:32:01,320 --> 01:32:05,320
understand more than most that it's easy to catch yourself in that train of thought, but for a man

1235
01:32:05,320 --> 01:32:09,480
who's always seemed concerned about how to change people's lives for the better, he doesn't seem to

1236
01:32:09,480 --> 01:32:14,920
know what's best for himself. If he did, I doubt we'd be here discussing it today. Notch's behaviour

1237
01:32:14,920 --> 01:32:18,840
post Minecraft has definitely promoted a strange relationship for many people with the game,

1238
01:32:18,840 --> 01:32:22,760
and bringing his name up in conversation to those passionate about the game, there's not a sense of

1239
01:32:22,840 --> 01:32:27,160
great anger, but more just frustration and disappointment. Like with other celebrities,

1240
01:32:27,160 --> 01:32:30,680
it's caused people to look back at creative decisions and question whether the science

1241
01:32:30,680 --> 01:32:35,080
were always there, whether they can truly enjoy a game anymore in the context of what he said,

1242
01:32:35,080 --> 01:32:39,320
what if they're just supporting a game with dangerous stereotypes and connotations themselves?

1243
01:32:39,320 --> 01:32:43,640
It's hard to deal with the implications of speech, and you can't blame people for feeling conflicted

1244
01:32:43,640 --> 01:32:47,160
about a game that they may have previously held very close to them throughout most of their life.

1245
01:32:47,720 --> 01:32:51,960
As he sold his shares, possessing or buying Minecraft doesn't really help him directly,

1246
01:32:51,960 --> 01:32:56,040
but even if they removed his credits, it'll always be his framework, and it's understandable

1247
01:32:56,040 --> 01:33:01,160
if that makes people feel a bit ambivalent. What happened to that guy that so many knew and loved?

1248
01:33:01,160 --> 01:33:05,080
I don't think the Marcus person that people thought they knew ever disappeared, nor do I

1249
01:33:05,080 --> 01:33:09,320
think that he was an inherently hateful person, but I think over the years he definitely became

1250
01:33:09,320 --> 01:33:13,080
a more challenging and troubled figure. He was never equipped to be a big time figurehead,

1251
01:33:13,080 --> 01:33:16,680
he yearned for close interpersonal bonds, the simple pleasures of a creative's life,

1252
01:33:16,680 --> 01:33:20,520
and he thought that cashing out his shares would allow him to get back to some form of normalcy,

1253
01:33:20,520 --> 01:33:24,760
but to put it as concisely as possible, his position opened up a lot of old wounds and

1254
01:33:24,760 --> 01:33:28,440
vulnerabilities that led him down a very dangerous path, and only seemed to halt when

1255
01:33:28,440 --> 01:33:33,240
he revealed how far he was down there. It traded one form of status for another, possibly worse,

1256
01:33:33,240 --> 01:33:37,400
form of status. He could've settled down to a long life of video game panels, Ted Talks,

1257
01:33:37,400 --> 01:33:41,480
and meet and greets, become a visiting professor at a state university, or just gradually work on

1258
01:33:41,480 --> 01:33:46,040
maintaining strong social bonds that would keep him from losing his mind. Instead, his handprints

1259
01:33:46,040 --> 01:33:50,200
on a game have mostly been erased, his mention provokes uncertain groans, and some people would

1260
01:33:50,440 --> 01:33:54,520
credit a fictional figure for the creation of one of the most universal experiences in recent

1261
01:33:54,520 --> 01:33:58,360
history. He always seemed to have set this, but over the years has continued to name drop

1262
01:33:58,360 --> 01:34:02,840
his magnum opus in many tweets, still reflecting on that era of his life, maybe only beginning to

1263
01:34:02,840 --> 01:34:07,560
appreciate some of it properly now, it feels like he's still not over it. Whether all his previous

1264
01:34:07,560 --> 01:34:11,960
actions were attempts to move past it is something only he knows, but when so much of your life is

1265
01:34:11,960 --> 01:34:16,760
still tied to one game and its legacy, it's hard to create a new one. I think back to one quote I

1266
01:34:16,760 --> 01:34:21,160
read in his blog post that if he ever accidentally ends up creating anything that might garner

1267
01:34:21,160 --> 01:34:25,000
attention, he'll just scrap it immediately. Notch never seemed to find a position in life

1268
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:29,160
where he was truly comfortable. I think it came down to three things, resources, time,

1269
01:34:29,160 --> 01:34:33,880
and purpose. When he started his work he had time and purpose, but a lack of resources. As the game

1270
01:34:33,880 --> 01:34:39,080
took off he had resources and purpose, but no time, and after he sold his shares he had resources

1271
01:34:39,080 --> 01:34:43,720
and time, but no purpose, and his fear of ever gracing the spotlight again has often left him

1272
01:34:43,720 --> 01:34:48,360
in that limbo. In the time that he was in the public spotlight it was hard to pinpoint a moment

1273
01:34:48,360 --> 01:34:52,360
where Notch was ever comfortable with his life, and that eternal restlessness is something that

1274
01:34:52,360 --> 01:34:57,000
can really corrupt the mind. I think it put him in a spot where he consigned himself to a stasis

1275
01:34:57,000 --> 01:35:00,760
that he didn't want to live with. He loved programming but didn't enjoy the human aspects

1276
01:35:00,760 --> 01:35:04,440
of success, but didn't want to be defined by one thing, but didn't know how to escape that

1277
01:35:04,440 --> 01:35:08,760
definition. His love of community and desire to please people was replaced with this distrust

1278
01:35:08,760 --> 01:35:13,800
and resentment towards all those around him, and eventually manifested in more and more destructive

1279
01:35:13,800 --> 01:35:18,360
ways, leaving me to wonder if he could really rebuild his public image after it all.

1280
01:35:18,360 --> 01:35:22,680
One of Notch's resolutions this year was to create a new game, him making wry commentary

1281
01:35:22,680 --> 01:35:26,760
on his own commitment to do that. It still doesn't feel like he entirely knows what he wants.

1282
01:35:26,760 --> 01:35:30,760
Minecraft was one of the most stressful areas of his life, it's understandable that he doesn't want

1283
01:35:30,760 --> 01:35:35,400
to relive that, but sometimes you wonder if he still craves a bit of the taste. He's at a

1284
01:35:35,400 --> 01:35:39,560
different stage of his life now, and so is Minecraft, to the point where you wonder if they

1285
01:35:39,560 --> 01:35:44,600
even recognise each other. People draw parallels still, and wonder how the two grew so far apart.

1286
01:35:44,600 --> 01:35:48,200
However, amongst the politics, the business interests, the billions of dollars, the social

1287
01:35:48,200 --> 01:35:53,080
media meltdowns, the far right conspiracy theories, they still came from the same place.

1288
01:35:53,080 --> 01:35:57,160
That was existent before any individual or business could dip their fingers in the pie,

1289
01:35:57,160 --> 01:36:01,480
and although a person's evolving ideas can retroactively impact their art, the truth is that

1290
01:36:01,480 --> 01:36:06,200
the place that Minecraft came from could never be represented by any tweet, and the game will always

1291
01:36:06,200 --> 01:36:11,160
transcend whatever people put on social media accounts. We talk about art, but Minecraft isn't

1292
01:36:11,160 --> 01:36:15,960
just a painting, it's the whole damn gallery, and so many people would create such great work

1293
01:36:15,960 --> 01:36:20,760
on that canvas for years, decades, and maybe even centuries to come. So when Microsoft says

1294
01:36:20,760 --> 01:36:25,000
that Notch doesn't really represent Minecraft's values, I don't think they're entirely wrong,

1295
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:29,720
but it was still a part of him. Minecraft is greater than any single person, even Notch

1296
01:36:29,720 --> 01:36:34,920
himself, but maybe Notch needs to be greater than Minecraft. As most avid Minecraft players

1297
01:36:34,920 --> 01:36:39,160
will probably know, upon completion of Minecraft Survival Mode, you reach the end credits of the

1298
01:36:39,160 --> 01:36:44,120
game, accompanied by a verse composition known as the End Poem. It lasts just shy of 9 minutes,

1299
01:36:44,120 --> 01:36:47,880
and takes the structure of a conversation between two beings that present themselves as all that

1300
01:36:47,880 --> 01:36:52,680
isn't the player, essentially the universe. It analyses many themes that Minecraft represents,

1301
01:36:52,680 --> 01:36:57,240
but appears to conclude that the player themselves is the answer to all the questions they may have.

1302
01:36:57,320 --> 01:37:00,440
You control your own destiny, you control your own fates.

1303
01:37:00,440 --> 01:37:04,760
At the end of 2022, the author of the poem wrote a post on the blogging site Substack,

1304
01:37:04,760 --> 01:37:08,040
explaining that he had made the decision to place the poem in the public domain as he had

1305
01:37:08,040 --> 01:37:12,040
not contractually handed over his rights to Microsoft or Mojang. However, it's the reason

1306
01:37:12,040 --> 01:37:16,120
behind this, and the story that inspired it, that is far more interesting. As Gough explained,

1307
01:37:16,120 --> 01:37:20,920
he was hired in 2012 by Person to work on the final text, and quickly struck up a camaraderie

1308
01:37:20,920 --> 01:37:25,800
with our Minecraft lead. However, when involving Karl Manet, the business' CEO, things quickly

1309
01:37:25,800 --> 01:37:30,360
turned sour as they attempted to enter business negotiations. In the end, all Gough saw from his

1310
01:37:30,360 --> 01:37:34,920
contributions was a single $20,000 check. The contract itself was a pretty standard but

1311
01:37:34,920 --> 01:37:39,320
stringent hand over all exclusive rights to Mojang, including an NDA which would've obviously

1312
01:37:39,320 --> 01:37:43,880
prevented Gough from even mentioning this agreement at all. However, that wasn't the kicker.

1313
01:37:43,880 --> 01:37:48,760
Now that came in 2014, when Gough received an email from Karl following up on the agreement,

1314
01:37:48,760 --> 01:37:53,720
requesting the signature once more. Gough explains that Manet had framed this as housekeeping,

1315
01:37:53,720 --> 01:37:57,400
when in reality research showed this was just around the time the shareholders were looking

1316
01:37:57,400 --> 01:38:03,160
to cash out, and were merely tying up some loose ends. With the buyout estimated to be $2.5 billion,

1317
01:38:03,160 --> 01:38:07,480
Gough felt a bit deceived and shortchanged, especially with how he had been treated up to

1318
01:38:07,480 --> 01:38:11,240
that point. He felt disrespected by people he considered friends, and although he ultimately

1319
01:38:11,240 --> 01:38:15,400
didn't sign the contract, it still offended him. In spite of this and the heated exchange that

1320
01:38:15,400 --> 01:38:19,640
followed, he didn't seek legal counsel, he didn't formally request his poem be removed from the game

1321
01:38:19,640 --> 01:38:24,440
despite the furor it could've caused, he merely let it be. He ultimately did nothing, and gained

1322
01:38:24,440 --> 01:38:28,760
nothing from it, and at first he felt bitter and resentful, but since states he has found peace.

1323
01:38:28,760 --> 01:38:32,600
As a matter of fact, he argues that it was an important learning curve, and although he could've

1324
01:38:32,600 --> 01:38:36,600
pursued it a bit more aggressively and ended up financially better off, he seems thankful he

1325
01:38:36,600 --> 01:38:41,320
wasn't, as he probably learned more from losing out. However, he can't properly move on until

1326
01:38:41,320 --> 01:38:45,480
he addresses the outstanding issue surrounding the copyright, not wishing to grant Microsoft

1327
01:38:45,480 --> 01:38:49,560
the exclusive rights but also not wishing to remove it from the game. He ultimately relinquishes

1328
01:38:49,560 --> 01:38:53,720
it to the public domain, and tells people to do whatever the hell they want with it. He was giving

1329
01:38:53,720 --> 01:38:58,520
his work back to the world and drawing a line under it. Originally I wrote a paragraph here

1330
01:38:58,520 --> 01:39:02,600
explaining why I included this anecdote, but I think I'm going to let it speak for itself.

1331
01:39:02,600 --> 01:39:07,000
All I'll say is that, as written at the end, you are the answer to your own questions, it's never

1332
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:11,560
too late to add some chapters to your story and give people a more satisfying conclusion, you just

1333
01:39:11,560 --> 01:39:15,560
need to turn the page. Maybe Notch needs to be greater than Minecraft.

1334
01:39:19,880 --> 01:39:24,840
Yep, so there we have it, that's the video. Hard one to end honestly, it's really hard to think of a

1335
01:39:24,840 --> 01:39:29,800
way to wrap it up, but hopefully I have given you some food for thought at least, and maybe something

1336
01:39:29,800 --> 01:39:35,640
to provoke discussion. I'd really like to thank my editors, they've once again done an outstanding

1337
01:39:35,640 --> 01:39:40,040
job, I'm forever grateful for their contribution, it means a lot to me guys, and be sure to check

1338
01:39:40,040 --> 01:39:43,880
them out if you have the time, their credits are all in the pinned comment below. I'd also like to

1339
01:39:43,880 --> 01:39:50,040
give a thanks to my patrons, $10 patrons on screen now, or $10 plus at least, thank you very much guys,

1340
01:39:50,040 --> 01:39:56,600
really appreciate it, and more personal shout out to my $50 patrons, Hypercube, Esther Bedoya,

1341
01:39:56,600 --> 01:40:01,880
Laura Woodward, and Seri Tisch, thank you so much, your support genuinely means a lot. I'd also like

1342
01:40:01,880 --> 01:40:07,160
to thank the thumbnail creator, Starfo, he does great work, great work as always, and the post

1343
01:40:07,240 --> 01:40:12,920
editors, Scam, and Grumpy, two fantastically industrious people who did not stop at anything

1344
01:40:12,920 --> 01:40:18,760
to get the job done. I'd also like to thank my sponsor, Aura, it was a pleasure working with you,

1345
01:40:18,760 --> 01:40:24,040
they've been very very good to me, and hopefully if you enjoy using their app they can be good to

1346
01:40:24,040 --> 01:40:28,680
you as well. Otherwise, I hope you guys are doing well, and I hope you took something away from this

1347
01:40:28,680 --> 01:40:32,760
at least, this little ramble, and be sure to take care of yourselves. I don't really have too much

1348
01:40:32,760 --> 01:40:37,480
else to add, so I'm The Right Opinion, and I will see you in the next one.
