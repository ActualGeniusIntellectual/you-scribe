00:00.000 --> 00:18.760
Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time, and a legacy,

00:18.760 --> 00:24.040
something that I'm sure many of us have pondered. The age-old question beckons, when we all move on from this world,

00:24.040 --> 00:28.600
what will we leave behind? The truth is, none of us can ever know for certain, because the moment we pass on,

00:28.600 --> 00:32.800
we relinquish most control of the narrative surrounding how we're remembered. People who have been considered

00:32.800 --> 00:37.800
controversial and problematic have been recontextualised by their death, and sometimes, figures previously revered

00:37.800 --> 00:43.000
have had their involvement in some very seedy antics revealed post-mortem. In some cases, a perspective will take

00:43.000 --> 00:48.200
centuries to form, in other times it will take merely days. However, one thing that remains central in analysis of

00:48.200 --> 00:54.440
individuals is the existence of art. I use the term art liberally, of course, here. I'm not just talking about a painting

00:54.480 --> 00:59.480
or a sculpture, I'm talking about the general product of any form of creative process that can affect someone's life in a

00:59.480 --> 01:05.040
meaningful way. An artist's direct words or thoughts may be long forgotten, but their creations will always serve as a window

01:05.040 --> 01:10.360
to their mind. What these works may say specifically is often down to interpretation, but there are often general themes

01:10.360 --> 01:15.840
that many people identify with, which is what provides them with a following and a reputation. Upon analysis of such

01:15.840 --> 01:20.960
content, many of us draw parallels between the pieces and the person behind them. After all, art should be a part of

01:20.960 --> 01:26.400
oneself, we enjoy identifying with others, even when it extends to maestros who we could never really hope to get near in

01:26.400 --> 01:32.240
terms of genius. For the new generation of aspiring creatives, times have somewhat evolved, particularly with the presence

01:32.240 --> 01:37.400
of social media, which enables many people to speak more directly to their chosen audience. For those who choose to use

01:37.400 --> 01:42.520
it, you may have a close-up on the person behind a beloved work, and based on their behaviour, you may be able to make a

01:42.520 --> 01:47.880
summary judgement if you want to delve into their works much further. However, with all the benefits that such an experience

01:47.880 --> 01:53.400
can provide, it can also play into unhealthy parasocial relationships, one that we've spoken about in the past,

01:53.400 --> 01:59.400
particularly when said art may not appear to reflect a person's character. Yes, every now and then, anomalies appear on the

01:59.400 --> 02:04.400
system, people who may have created something wonderful that many find to be an uplifting and positive force in their life

02:04.400 --> 02:10.400
may also have negatively affected others in a marked way, either due to their actions or words separate to their art.

02:10.400 --> 02:16.120
This is where the discourse surrounding distinguishing art form from the artist originates. Appreciating good workmanship

02:16.160 --> 02:22.160
doesn't necessarily presuppose a complete endorsement of the person behind it. However, over time, the bar for this sort of

02:22.160 --> 02:27.560
standard has definitely been lowered a little. With the rise of social media, and people perhaps having a bit too much time to

02:27.560 --> 02:33.720
argue, this sort of distinction has become more and more regularly employed. A prime example of such a trend is JK Rowling,

02:33.720 --> 02:38.920
a previously renowned celebrity who took a political position that was contrary to many of her colleagues and fans.

02:38.920 --> 02:44.280
If she'd never sent out a tweet on the matter, many people who probably regard her with disdain would still adore her.

02:44.600 --> 02:50.920
Humans are complex, multi-faster creatures, many of whom are deeply troubled and don't necessarily benefit from the public spotlight,

02:50.920 --> 02:55.880
sometimes leaving us to wonder whether we knew them as well as we thought we did, and perhaps wishing we didn't know them

02:55.880 --> 03:02.360
quite as well now. This is what leads us to probably the most quintessentially Gen-Z example, a gentleman by the name of Marcus

03:02.360 --> 03:05.400
Persson, or as he is known to many online, Notch.

03:05.960 --> 03:25.080
Notch is a Swedish game developer, who in 2009 began a humble little project known as Minecraft. I feel like I shouldn't have to

03:25.080 --> 03:30.360
elaborate too much here, but Minecraft is a sandbox video game which enables the user to build a multitude of structures

03:30.360 --> 03:36.680
and face off against a variety of monsters who descend upon the player at dusk. It has four modes, creative, survival,

03:36.680 --> 03:43.160
hardcore, and adventure, each with its own type of gamer, allowing for a very broad appeal indeed. Over the last decade

03:43.160 --> 03:49.720
and a bit, it has amassed cross-platform sales in excess of $230 million, making it the best-selling video game of all time

03:49.720 --> 03:55.800
by a significant margin. It has also received numerous awards, franchised itself to a dizzying extent, and established itself

03:55.800 --> 04:01.720
as a cultural force to be reckoned with, its timeless appeal being typified by its continued creation of public figures

04:01.720 --> 04:08.040
who are likely just as publicly visible as the man behind the game. But in a way, I suppose it makes sense, many individual

04:08.040 --> 04:13.160
developers are barely a fraction as well known as the games they create, they're most comfortable making the magic happen

04:13.160 --> 04:19.560
behind the scenes, and in the case of many games, it's hardly a singular effort, and very few people end up being standout

04:19.560 --> 04:25.320
figures. Audiences can't expect to learn the entire roster of a video game studio. Notch was different though, as the

04:25.320 --> 04:30.680
big head behind Minecraft, he set himself apart from faceless corporations and created a unique bond with his audience,

04:30.680 --> 04:36.200
utilising the game's network and accompanying social media platforms to create this almost legendary figure in gaming

04:36.200 --> 04:42.120
circles, who would interact and respond to feedback from many of the devoted audience. To many, Minecraft and Notch

04:42.120 --> 04:45.560
were inseparable. Well, until they weren't.

04:45.960 --> 04:48.520
Maybe, I don't know, were you the Minecraft guy? No.

04:51.160 --> 04:57.000
Cut to 2022 though, and trying to find any remnants of even the word Notch on Minecraft's servers would be a challenge

04:57.000 --> 05:05.000
to even the most ardent user. Person unsurprisingly had cashed out his shares in 2014, making a tidy 1.7 billion dollars,

05:05.000 --> 05:09.880
and adopting a lifestyle that supported that. In many ways, he had done what many creatives wished they could do,

05:09.880 --> 05:15.480
walk away with a shithole of money, and have your legacy commemorated and honoured by many users and creators.

05:15.720 --> 05:21.160
However, barely a couple of years after he'd become a billionaire, Notch began to publicly head down a curious path,

05:21.160 --> 05:25.800
one that gradually became more and more questionable to those who looked on, and eventually resulted in Microsoft,

05:25.800 --> 05:31.320
the company who had bought out Minecraft, to cuddle public ties with him in the hopes that a PR nightmare would be averted.

05:31.320 --> 05:37.080
It seems that in spite of his undeniable contribution to modern culture, certain people believe he would be better off

05:37.080 --> 05:43.320
forgotten altogether. Well, today we're going to be paying him a bit of time, taking a look at the man behind Minecraft,

05:43.320 --> 05:49.560
the mind that married the creation, the eventual and painful divorce, and what legacy may be left behind.

05:50.200 --> 05:54.600
Ladies, gentlemen, and all other flavours of quarks, I think it's best we go to the start,

05:55.320 --> 05:59.160
dare I say it, to a world without Minecraft. Let's go.

06:00.680 --> 06:06.120
This video is sponsored by Aura, and the following ad is only suitable for US citizens,

06:06.120 --> 06:09.880
so if you're with me and old Blighty, then put on a cup of tea or something.

06:09.880 --> 06:14.360
Austin, you're f***ing healing me. Heal me, you f***ing w- what, are you dumb b***h?

06:14.360 --> 06:17.480
Harley, Harley, Harley, I don't really think you deserve heals, to be honest.

06:18.040 --> 06:20.360
Hey, it's me, Bored Oranges, from YouTube.

06:20.360 --> 06:23.160
Let the f***ing game, Oranges, stop flogging your channel.

06:23.800 --> 06:27.560
Um, guys, I think my channel just got hacked.

06:27.560 --> 06:27.960
Wow.

06:27.960 --> 06:28.840
Jesus, really?

06:28.840 --> 06:29.320
Holy shit.

06:29.320 --> 06:34.280
I feel like, guys, I'm totally quitting Twitter, and you should give me all your money for, like, Tesla and crap and stuff.

06:34.280 --> 06:35.560
Can somebody pick off that Moira?

06:35.560 --> 06:38.600
Oh yeah, oh yeah, you're flogging Teslas now, Austin.

06:38.600 --> 06:40.760
Elon's gonna be really, really hyped about that.

06:42.040 --> 06:45.640
Shit, what am I even supposed to do right now? Do I contact support?

06:46.360 --> 06:47.960
I do have one idea.

06:48.520 --> 06:50.200
Have you heard of Aura?

06:50.200 --> 06:52.360
No, uh, what is it?

06:53.240 --> 06:55.160
Here, let me send you a link.

06:55.160 --> 06:59.320
It's a privacy and security app. Sounds like something you might need.

06:59.320 --> 07:04.440
I don't even think I could afford something like that, and how exactly is that going to help me now?

07:04.440 --> 07:07.640
Well, thanks to a special deal I've been cooking up.

07:07.640 --> 07:12.840
You can get two weeks absolutely free, so you don't have to worry about the cost while you are testing it out.

07:13.960 --> 07:16.040
www.aura.com slash opinion.

07:17.080 --> 07:19.960
Preferably, you'd make use of Aura before something bad happens,

07:19.960 --> 07:24.200
but as it already has, we're going to try and stop the hackers in their tracks.

07:24.200 --> 07:26.280
Do you still have access to your accounts?

07:26.280 --> 07:27.800
Okay, hold on a sec.

07:27.800 --> 07:29.880
Please heal me. Focus on the game.

07:31.560 --> 07:32.440
Yes.

07:32.440 --> 07:33.880
Okay, good, then this will be easy.

07:33.880 --> 07:37.480
What we're going to do is kick out the hackers from your accounts before they change anything else,

07:37.880 --> 07:42.360
and then make use of Aura's 256 AES encrypted password manager

07:42.360 --> 07:46.200
to generate new, stronger passwords to make sure they never do this again.

07:46.200 --> 07:49.720
Aura also lets you know if your current passwords are weak, and crucially,

07:49.720 --> 07:53.720
if your passwords have been involved in data breaches and are exposed on the dark web.

07:53.720 --> 07:55.720
Is anyone going to sort out that Reinhardt who keeps hitting my arse?

07:55.720 --> 07:59.240
Oh, wow, that was really easy.

07:59.240 --> 08:01.720
I was honestly worried there for a second.

08:01.720 --> 08:03.960
Well, Aura makes staying safe online easy.

08:03.960 --> 08:06.520
If you think that's good, wait till you hear about what else it can do.

08:06.520 --> 08:09.720
My friend's been getting all these spam calls and emails due to data brokers

08:09.720 --> 08:11.560
profiting off selling private information.

08:12.120 --> 08:14.840
Aura will identify those data brokers that are selling your information

08:14.840 --> 08:17.640
and automatically send them opt-out requests on your behalf.

08:17.640 --> 08:23.240
Aura also does real-time credit and identity theft monitoring and has a VPN with an antivirus.

08:23.240 --> 08:27.720
Typically, you'd have to pay for those separate features, but here you can get it all in one app.

08:27.720 --> 08:28.680
Thank you, James.

08:28.680 --> 08:30.680
And I mean it seriously.

08:30.680 --> 08:31.240
Thank you.

08:32.120 --> 08:33.480
You're most welcome, Austin.

08:33.480 --> 08:34.520
You're most welcome.

08:34.520 --> 08:36.920
Let Aura do the hard work of keeping you safe online.

08:36.920 --> 08:41.160
If you sign up right now with my link, www.aura.com slash opinion,

08:44.040 --> 08:45.400
Now, back to the video.

08:45.400 --> 08:46.680
Can we group up already?

08:53.640 --> 08:55.240
The decade is the 1980s.

08:55.240 --> 08:58.520
Technology is emerging pretty quickly, with various movements in the industry

08:58.520 --> 09:02.920
taking the world by storm, with many pieces of media romanticizing its popularity.

09:02.920 --> 09:06.520
However, enthusiasm for that sector was still treated with disdain by some,

09:06.520 --> 09:09.400
and as many 80s coming-of-age films will likely tell you,

09:09.400 --> 09:13.080
the cool kids were still the ones who could flatten some poor sod in a game of football.

09:13.080 --> 09:16.200
For many, forms of technology were an outlet to keep them away from the

09:16.200 --> 09:19.240
toxic social hierarchies they felt they couldn't compete in,

09:19.240 --> 09:23.720
and by the 80s, one of the very important branches of technology was the video game.

09:23.720 --> 09:27.560
In early times, you would have to commute to the arcade to have a taste of what video games

09:27.560 --> 09:31.400
actually entailed, but with the increased commercial reach and accessibility of consoles,

09:31.400 --> 09:35.160
the market opened up much more to those who enjoyed the pastime of gaming,

09:35.160 --> 09:39.000
not just one of those people who wasn't really interested in being the coolest at school.

09:39.000 --> 09:42.680
Deeply fascinated by mechanics from a young age, he spent much of his time indoors,

09:42.680 --> 09:46.680
initially taking a keen interest in Lego, but soon turning his attention to his personal

09:46.680 --> 09:51.240
Commodore 1 to a computer, either playing it or programming it, much of the time with codes

09:51.240 --> 09:53.960
from a magazine network that his father was subscribed to.

09:53.960 --> 09:56.600
At the age of eight, he produced his first video game,

09:56.600 --> 09:59.880
one that he reassuringly informed an interviewer was basic.

10:00.440 --> 10:03.160
Back then, these sorts of pastimes were vocational to many,

10:03.160 --> 10:06.920
very few people knew exactly where artificial intelligence would be in 20 years time,

10:06.920 --> 10:10.680
with some still arguing the idea that an online network could never be achieved,

10:10.680 --> 10:13.080
and others claiming it would just be a fad regardless.

10:13.080 --> 10:16.040
But over the years, it continued to defy many of its detractors,

10:16.040 --> 10:19.640
with persisting developments and watershed moments that set the bar higher and higher

10:19.640 --> 10:21.240
in scientific accomplishment.

10:21.240 --> 10:23.880
With an expanding industry in an expanding market,

10:23.880 --> 10:27.000
a person who had dropped out of high school likely sensed an opportunity.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.560
His mother put him on a programming course to hone his talent,

10:29.560 --> 10:31.880
and by the time he was 18, he had his first job.

10:40.200 --> 10:44.440
After a few rocky periods in between, he was one of the first developers hired by a Stockholm-based

10:44.440 --> 10:48.520
company then known as Midas Player, later to become King, the corporation who made the

10:48.520 --> 10:53.640
legendary Candy Crush Stargut, inescapable from the daily lives of all, from our phones to our

10:53.640 --> 10:57.880
skylines. The person worked on a fair few games during his 4-5 years stint at the company,

10:57.880 --> 11:01.720
however he always kept one of his eyes on a few side projects that he would work on in his free

11:01.720 --> 11:07.080
time, developing a fair few games to boot. In 2006, he released the Java-based game Worm Online,

11:07.080 --> 11:11.720
a game he had developed with long-time friend Rolf Jensen, a sandbox MMO where players could

11:11.720 --> 11:16.200
construct buildings, mine for materials, and craft tools. Sound familiar?

11:16.200 --> 11:19.960
Well, there were a few differences, it's definitely a bit more complex, probably leaning more into

11:19.960 --> 11:24.360
games like RuneScape for its more detailed visuals and skill level system that provides people with

11:24.360 --> 11:29.000
a clear roadmap to mastery of the arts. However, there is also a more factional element that allows

11:29.000 --> 11:33.320
people to join villages and allies, declare on others if they want, alongside a religious system

11:33.320 --> 11:37.960
that allows people to worship a certain deity, each one having their own unique perks. It provides

11:37.960 --> 11:42.040
an arrangement where users essentially create their own lore and history within the game.

11:42.040 --> 11:46.920
It's a clever system, and the game does appear to have some popularity to this day, but in 2007,

11:46.920 --> 11:50.840
the year after Worm was first released, Notch stepped away from his commitment to the game,

11:50.840 --> 11:56.280
and the studio, then known as Mojang Specifications AB. Despite moving on from this

11:56.280 --> 12:01.000
venture, person wished to retain the namesake Mojang for his next project. However, afraid of

12:01.000 --> 12:06.040
market competition, Midas player barred him, and all employees from making games in their free time.

12:06.040 --> 12:10.680
However, clearly valuing his individual creativity, Notch responded by quitting his job,

12:10.680 --> 12:14.760
taking up work at a friendlier employer, and dedicating the following months to replicating

12:14.760 --> 12:16.920
a game by the name of Infiniminer.

12:21.800 --> 12:30.280
Infiniminer is a block-based sandbox game in which a player harvests minerals by cutting through

12:30.280 --> 12:35.240
procedurally generated maps. Sound familiar? Well, yeah, this one should really. Infiniminer was

12:35.240 --> 12:40.440
released by indie developer Zachtronics, named after its founder, Zach Barr. It wasn't particularly

12:40.440 --> 12:44.680
hyped on release, and hadn't created large grounds well after, but it caught the attention of Marcus,

12:44.680 --> 12:49.160
who said that although it had a clear character, still left a lot to the imagination. At the time

12:49.160 --> 12:53.320
Marcus had been working on a project known as Ruby Dunk, a base building game in which he had

12:53.320 --> 12:57.400
experimented with a feature that enabled first person perspective, but ultimately felt it was

12:57.400 --> 13:02.600
too undeveloped in its current format. Although Person admired many aspects of Infiniminer,

13:02.600 --> 13:07.000
he wished to create an environment that leaned into the more RPG theme, one that would emphasize

13:07.000 --> 13:11.480
survival in the wilderness. He also wanted to focus on details of the in-game experience,

13:11.480 --> 13:15.800
sound effects that would relate to each individual action, and how a player base may respond to that.

13:19.160 --> 13:31.640
On May the 13th, 2009, Notch, using an account by the name of Ninzotch on YouTube, posted a video

13:31.640 --> 13:36.840
titled Cave Game Tech Test. This upload was well received by users at the time, and a couple days

13:36.840 --> 13:39.880
later, he seemed to have settled on a name, Minecraft.

13:50.680 --> 13:54.760
In this time, Notch continued to post updates to his YouTube channel and personal Tumblr blog that

13:54.760 --> 13:59.000
followed progress on the game pretty closely. Four days after posting Cave Game Tech Test,

13:59.000 --> 14:02.680
he opened up the game to the public, providing users with a link if they wish to play it

14:02.680 --> 14:06.760
themselves. Notch predominantly used forums for the independent game source to distribute his

14:06.760 --> 14:10.920
new project, the same one that he had found Infiniminer on. There wasn't any real big

14:10.920 --> 14:14.360
promotional push, nor was there any large investment from companies who believed in

14:14.360 --> 14:18.520
the project, it was the true definition of an indie game. Just over 20 years after he had

14:18.520 --> 14:23.080
created his first game on the Commodore 128, he had published a humble sandbox game on Java,

14:23.080 --> 14:27.000
but the world was a lot larger now and dominated by companies who had a million times the resources

14:27.000 --> 14:33.000
of a person like Persons. Indie games were a dime a dozen, and Notch's couldn't have been that unique, right?

14:36.760 --> 14:52.840
Intro

14:52.840 --> 14:57.400
Very few people know when they're making their magnum opus that it will be their magnum opus.

14:57.800 --> 15:06.200
Intro

15:06.200 --> 15:10.200
You can speculate how people will receive it, but you can never foresee public reaction,

15:10.200 --> 15:13.560
and you can never account for every single issue that a consumer might point out.

15:13.560 --> 15:17.080
When Notch first made the game playable, there were more than enough issues to count,

15:17.080 --> 15:20.760
and many people were the first to let him know. However, there was definitely something unique

15:20.760 --> 15:24.680
about Minecraft from the off. I'm not going to go through every detail, because there are creators

15:24.680 --> 15:28.760
out there who are much more enthusiastic than me and have made it far more in-depth videos, but I

15:28.760 --> 15:33.000
think the best way to summarise would be to say that it on one hand being a rather simple sandbox

15:33.000 --> 15:37.320
allowed for a rather broad range of virtual realities, one where a world could be built around

15:37.320 --> 15:41.720
your vision. At the same time, the RPG element, the first person perspective, gave it a more

15:41.720 --> 15:46.040
competitive element and rewarded a person for the proficiency and skills required for survival.

15:46.040 --> 15:50.440
Whereas Notch's previous game Worm had a system built on levels that was meant to supply an outward

15:50.440 --> 15:55.560
motive for mastery, Minecraft was inherent. It was a simple system, but it was one that works,

15:55.560 --> 16:00.360
and one that you progress through naturally. A bedrock so basic that can create a world so

16:00.360 --> 16:05.000
complex. I think the best thing that can be said about the game is that you never have the exact

16:05.000 --> 16:09.640
same experience twice, and for many that was embodied by the existence of Minecraft. The

16:09.640 --> 16:13.320
familiar aspects were there, you never had to relearn the fundamentals, there was never an

16:13.320 --> 16:17.000
alienation of experience, and many of the processes were as simple as a few clicks,

16:17.000 --> 16:21.320
but the opportunities branched off each time you decided to take your experience to the world in a

16:21.320 --> 16:25.720
new direction. The visual design was unvarnished, making it undemanding to be seized and accessible

16:25.720 --> 16:29.880
to many users, still retaining its own charm and feeling that it was intentional. It was also

16:29.880 --> 16:35.160
assisted by a barebones yet effective soundtrack and sound design by C418, another frequent user

16:35.160 --> 16:40.200
of the independent game source forum. His work can be identified by most from a single chord,

16:40.200 --> 16:45.560
and that's impressive. Yet a game is more than its premise, and can never be flawless on launch.

16:45.560 --> 16:48.920
That couldn't be more applicable to a game like Minecraft, which Notch decided to make

16:48.920 --> 16:52.840
playable from the preliminary stages of production. Notch couldn't necessarily afford

16:52.840 --> 16:57.000
his own game testers, so he relied on the feedback from users. You could tell that when it was first

16:57.000 --> 17:00.680
published it was still in its teething era. Although many people enjoyed it, Marcus was

17:00.680 --> 17:05.240
inundated with recommendations and requests from gamers who felt their experience could be enhanced,

17:05.240 --> 17:09.480
and Notch was on it, regularly responding to people and applying updates as soon as his day

17:09.480 --> 17:13.960
job was finished. Within three days of making the alpha open to all users, he had added a variety of

17:13.960 --> 17:18.200
features and continued to do so over the coming weeks, including a multiplayer mode at the turn

17:18.200 --> 17:22.360
of June. Much of this was conferred through the forums, but it soon expanded to his personal blog

17:22.360 --> 17:26.360
and equivalent social media that became dedicated to following the progress of the game as it

17:26.360 --> 17:30.760
garnered more and more interest from the wider internet. With the increasing popularity and

17:30.760 --> 17:34.440
knowledge that he would probably need funds to sustain development, Notch moved the game into

17:34.440 --> 17:38.920
a paid alpha stage for those who wanted a few more modes at their disposal. Unlike a lot of indie

17:38.920 --> 17:43.080
games trying to capitalise on the popularity, Notch actually made a decision to make his game

17:43.080 --> 17:47.560
a bit more expensive than he had initially valued it, linking an essay explaining the importance of

17:47.560 --> 17:51.880
not underselling indie games. In spite of this, many people happily obliged and continued to

17:51.880 --> 17:56.520
spread the word, leading to a snowball effect that resulted in more and more users. Videos, tweets,

17:56.520 --> 18:01.000
posts, onto a variety of social media websites continued to serve as Notch's own unpaid

18:01.000 --> 18:05.640
promotional campaign, and gave person all the time he wanted to focus on quality control,

18:05.640 --> 18:10.360
and to be fair to him, that's exactly what he did. With the rate of unexpected success

18:10.360 --> 18:13.640
that Notch was experiencing, it would have been easy for him to rest on his laurels or

18:13.640 --> 18:17.880
sell his work onto an eager investor. However, with each passing day he only seemed to dedicate

18:17.880 --> 18:22.040
more and more time to perfecting and updating the craft of this humble mining game. His

18:22.040 --> 18:26.520
proactiveness in actually attending to problems and responding to feedback didn't seem to let up,

18:26.520 --> 18:30.840
even as the game seemingly expanded beyond a single person's capability. He switched his day job

18:30.840 --> 18:35.000
to part-time, hired a couple people to help him manage designs, but still placed himself at the

18:35.000 --> 18:39.320
creative control panel of this undertaking, maintaining activity and status in the forums

18:39.320 --> 18:43.880
that had so graciously supported his project. He was still a one-man army, and amongst many was

18:43.880 --> 18:48.200
quickly obtaining status as a bit of a cult figure. However, things were beginning to spiral

18:48.200 --> 18:52.920
out of control a little. In the first year the game moved around 25,000 copies, pretty good for

18:52.920 --> 18:57.240
an indie game, but in 2010 it began to garner even more traction, selling thousands of copies in the

18:57.240 --> 19:02.520
space of a day. So much income was being generated from sales that, suspecting fraud, PayPal froze

19:02.520 --> 19:06.920
his account, which subsequently just generated more publicity. I mean, the dude was literally

19:06.920 --> 19:11.080
keeping hundreds of thousands in his PayPal. Although Notch was on top of his game, he didn't

19:11.080 --> 19:15.560
seem to be on top of his fame, there were some things that he just could not do on his own.

19:15.560 --> 19:20.920
Enter stage right now, the video game's mammoth headed by another popular figure, Gabe Newell.

19:20.920 --> 19:25.000
Noticing the success of Minecraft and the man behind it, they invited him over to Bellevue,

19:25.000 --> 19:28.440
Washington to see what the prospects of future work could be. They showed him around the

19:28.440 --> 19:32.360
headquarters, made him take some programming assessments, even having him meet with President

19:32.360 --> 19:36.600
Mr. Newell himself. All in all, it was quite the experience, and although they believed he

19:36.600 --> 19:40.040
had a bit to learn, they were happy to offer him a job that would hopefully provide him with a bit

19:40.040 --> 19:43.640
of stability. However, that wasn't the only thing that happened in Bellevue.

19:49.880 --> 19:53.720
When Notch announced he was travelling to Valve headquarters in the US, many people asked him if

19:53.720 --> 19:58.040
a meetup was possible. Person, thinking it could be a nice initiative, decided to announce the

19:58.040 --> 20:02.600
meeting on his Tumblr blog, jovially labelling it MinecraftCon, saying that it could be a good

20:02.600 --> 20:06.920
idea even if it's just three people sitting around in uncomfortable silence for 20 minutes.

20:06.920 --> 20:12.040
It wasn't quite that though, in fact over 50 people turned up, including one person in a full

20:12.040 --> 20:16.040
creeper costume. Although it didn't last for more than a few hours, it might just have been enough

20:16.040 --> 20:20.040
to convince Notch that although Valve's offer was likely flattering, there may be something

20:20.040 --> 20:24.760
more worthwhile in what he already had. So he turned down the move to Valve, and instead called

20:24.760 --> 20:29.400
up his longtime friend Jakob Pulsa, expressing the desire to take this whole little Minecraft

20:29.400 --> 20:33.400
gig a little bit more seriously. But was that what Notch wanted?

20:37.320 --> 20:42.040
Upon returning to Sweden, Person and Pulsa incorporated their business as Mojang AB,

20:42.040 --> 20:46.360
later to be Mojang Studios, and brought on some additional manpower to their workforce.

20:46.360 --> 20:50.120
They decided to commit a bit more time to game development in general, even beginning to work on

20:50.120 --> 20:54.600
another game called Scrolls, though it's now known as Call as Bane. It seems the wheels were firmly

20:54.600 --> 20:59.400
in motion on the Mojang machine, and not too soon after Notch was vindicated for his decision made

20:59.400 --> 21:03.960
in September, because Minecraft's growth didn't slow, in fact it did quite the opposite, even

21:03.960 --> 21:08.120
beginning to capture the attention of mainstream media sources. Less than 20 days after his visit

21:08.120 --> 21:12.440
to Bellevue, a YouTube video on Minecraft topped the platform's gaming charts for the first time,

21:12.440 --> 21:17.880
and by the end of October they had moved 500,000 copies, and by the end of the year PC Gamer UK had

21:17.880 --> 21:23.800
heralded it as the game of the year, all while still in beta. In many ways the offer on Valve

21:23.800 --> 21:27.800
is just what someone like Notch needed. This was a dude who had seemed a bit out of his depth at

21:27.800 --> 21:31.480
the time, hell, he was storing hundreds of thousands of pounds in his Paypal account,

21:31.480 --> 21:35.320
it felt like the backing of a more stable source of income was just what he needed. However,

21:35.320 --> 21:39.880
something tells me Notch didn't bank his success on the amount of income his little project generated.

21:39.880 --> 21:44.520
Nobody could have foreseen the success of a humble game initially posted onto an independent forum,

21:44.520 --> 21:48.120
especially Person, and really his ability to follow this through wouldn't depend on the

21:48.120 --> 21:52.600
amount of money he made, but more his own spark for the game, something that he clearly still

21:52.600 --> 21:53.800
believed he possessed.

21:53.800 --> 21:57.800
Does it just still make you happy to just keep working on the game every day?

21:57.800 --> 22:04.360
Yeah, so far yes. We got another game being prototyped and it's really fun to think about that,

22:04.360 --> 22:08.680
but so far the most fun is when I can actually just work on Minecraft.

22:08.680 --> 22:12.600
With the attention of major developers like Valve, it would have been very easy to let his elevated

22:12.600 --> 22:16.520
status get to him, but like a lot of accidental celebrities, Notch didn't really seem to view

22:16.520 --> 22:20.680
himself as one, he just wanted to keep working on his project, but that was at least somewhat

22:20.680 --> 22:25.240
difficult as the user base continued to manifest. He didn't make the game early access to the entire

22:25.240 --> 22:29.560
world with the intent of having the entire world play it, he had to adapt, and the new business

22:29.560 --> 22:33.960
model seemed like the best way forward. With a new business, there are new responsibilities,

22:33.960 --> 22:36.600
particularly if a game wants to continue to rule the market.

22:37.240 --> 22:42.040
In 2011, to consolidate their prosperity, the Mojang crew began to work on new versions for

22:42.040 --> 22:46.600
other platforms, initially for mobile devices, but console projects followed not too long after.

22:46.600 --> 22:50.360
The company also made the decision to start publishing games from other indie studios,

22:50.360 --> 22:55.320
additionally after the success of the spontaneous meetup in 2010, it was decided that MineCon would

22:55.320 --> 23:00.440
become an official event, it was planned to occur from the 18th to the 19th of October in Las Vegas.

23:00.440 --> 23:04.520
Everything was moving forward pretty smoothly, but was that the case for our title character?

23:05.080 --> 23:08.440
Notch really was the first of his kind in many ways, and he was certainly one of the first who

23:08.440 --> 23:12.840
became known among many for just being a developer. Although that was partly attributable to the

23:12.840 --> 23:16.600
success of the game, it was also a credit to his hands on nature and actual interest in the

23:16.600 --> 23:20.520
community that surrounded it. It was clear that he didn't wish to take any single person for

23:20.520 --> 23:24.600
granted, however there's a reason that sort of approach isn't typically linked to celebrities,

23:24.600 --> 23:29.640
to put it plainly, it's impossible to maintain. I'd say the best allegory is that of the YouTube

23:29.640 --> 23:33.400
channel really, there are people who when they start their channel will respond to every single

23:33.400 --> 23:37.160
comment and try and give as much attention to anybody who takes an interest in their work,

23:37.160 --> 23:41.240
but the attention may grow to the point where you cannot tangibly engage with everyone without

23:41.240 --> 23:45.960
sacrificing other aspects of the creative process. What people loved Notch for was a quality that

23:45.960 --> 23:50.600
would inevitably become incompatible with his status, and with that comes a few complications.

23:51.160 --> 23:54.840
When you have a small project, the first people who believe in it and support it are some of the

23:54.840 --> 23:58.520
most important supporters you can have, as they're the ones who may help you find your feet in

23:58.520 --> 24:02.680
momentum. If you reciprocate that positive attention, then these people will enjoy engaging

24:02.680 --> 24:06.680
with you because many of them appreciate being listened to, and their voice actually having

24:06.680 --> 24:10.600
influence. As a project grows, their voice will be diluted though, and this leads to more

24:10.600 --> 24:14.520
dissatisfaction, the allegations that you sold out, that you're not who you used to be, you've

24:14.520 --> 24:19.160
become lazy, etc, and you're going to come across people with completely conflicting visions of what

24:19.160 --> 24:23.320
you should do with your content, which often just leads to nobody being satisfied. Some of these

24:23.320 --> 24:27.240
dedicated individuals were also becoming increasingly obsessed with Notch's life,

24:27.240 --> 24:31.960
including to the point where someone created a timeline of his in-work absences. Even if he

24:31.960 --> 24:36.760
tried his utmost hardest, there was no way that Notch's position was sustainable, and over 2011

24:36.760 --> 24:41.720
as pressure continued to rise it was clear that he was, as they would say, suffering from success.

24:42.280 --> 24:47.000
In a Reddit AMA in April 2011, Notch acknowledges his nature to overstress and focus on the

24:47.000 --> 24:51.720
negativity, particularly over a runaway success like Minecraft. Hava also says he has made a

24:51.720 --> 24:56.040
commitment to managing it better, he seemed to be doing an okay job at managing that at first,

24:56.040 --> 25:00.200
but over the year this struggle appeared to resurface. This likely wasn't alleviated when

25:00.200 --> 25:04.360
Bethesda filed a lawsuit claiming the game's scrolls were too similar to the Elder Scrolls,

25:04.360 --> 25:09.400
which led to a months-long legal back and forth. Notch prevailed, but at what cost? This seemed to

25:09.400 --> 25:14.760
climax in the 2011 Minecon, which also marked the official release of Minecraft. There was every

25:14.760 --> 25:19.320
reason to celebrate, however it was marked by an incident involving a couple YouTubers,

25:19.320 --> 25:21.480
part of the channel known as the Yogscast.

25:21.480 --> 25:41.640
In their time, the Yogscast were one of the largest and most influential gaming channels

25:41.640 --> 25:45.960
on YouTube. Some of their members were also enthusiastic devotees of Minecraft, and Notch

25:45.960 --> 25:50.520
in return sang his praises for their work, so their appearance of Minecon 2011 should have been

25:50.520 --> 25:54.200
a match made in heaven. However, not too long after their appearance on the final night,

25:54.200 --> 25:58.440
a sleep-deprived Notch sent a series of enraged tweets that called out the pair for their supposed

25:58.440 --> 26:03.000
delinquent behaviour which included cursing, insulting, and all-around incendiary behaviour.

26:03.000 --> 26:07.000
Yogscast responded on their subreddit, disputing Notch's version of events and criticising the

26:07.000 --> 26:11.480
general organisation of Minecon. This tension persisted for a day or so before Notch relented

26:11.480 --> 26:15.560
and put out another statement apologising for his approach, and admitting it was likely a

26:15.560 --> 26:19.560
stress-related misunderstanding. At the height of his success, Notch should have at least been

26:19.560 --> 26:24.280
enjoying himself, yet it seemed that it was anything but that, and it's not surprising.

26:24.280 --> 26:28.520
He was never a person who enjoyed the public spotlight, and this increased level of tension,

26:28.520 --> 26:32.920
especially at an event like Minecon, was only going to escalate that further.

26:32.920 --> 26:46.280
The guy needed a break, but would he ever get it?

27:02.920 --> 27:14.360
As noted, Notch's approach to management wasn't really one that adapted to the levels of

27:14.360 --> 27:18.360
attention that he received. He didn't do it badly for what it was worth, but eventually you can't

27:18.360 --> 27:22.440
keep up with the continued public analysis of your existence, particularly when it's committed to a

27:22.440 --> 27:26.360
game that should really enable you to block out the world around you. So approximately a couple

27:26.360 --> 27:30.120
weeks after the official launch of Minecraft and Notch's little incident with the Yogscast,

27:30.120 --> 27:32.840
he announced he was stepping down as head programmer.

27:32.840 --> 27:36.280
The title of the post is in Swedish, a statement meaning with those words

27:36.280 --> 27:40.280
I hand over the microphone, with the rest of the short blog elaborating on a statement.

27:40.280 --> 27:44.600
The new head designer Jens Bergensten, also known as Jeb, had been working hard on developing the

27:44.600 --> 27:48.360
game's scrolls. The person was impressed by his work, and felt like he was the right person to

27:48.360 --> 27:52.680
take the game forward. He doesn't really talk too much about his own mental state, only saying that

27:52.680 --> 27:57.640
he will rest for a while, but intends to continue to help out Minecraft. With all things considered,

27:57.640 --> 28:01.560
this was probably the right decision, it would ease the public expectation while still allowing

28:01.560 --> 28:06.040
him to offer insight and ideas for his brainchild. Bergensten is by no means anonymous, and I don't

28:06.040 --> 28:10.360
want to suggest that, but Notch was still the face of the company in many regards, just one that had

28:10.360 --> 28:14.840
been stretched a bit too thin over the past few years, but would that be enough? Well, I think

28:14.840 --> 28:19.000
the key is perspective really. The move as it had been presented was one for a person's own

28:19.000 --> 28:22.840
wellbeing, however I think that Notch had to believe it himself, because whether he liked it

28:22.840 --> 28:27.240
or not, people still primarily associated Minecraft with him above anything else, and with that in

28:27.240 --> 28:31.000
mind there were still going to be people who held him responsible for the upkeep of the game,

28:31.000 --> 28:35.240
even if it wasn't technically his obligation at all. Notch had to simply accept that these people

28:35.240 --> 28:39.640
would exist, and stop caring about them. I think one of the problems with Notch is that he couldn't

28:39.640 --> 28:43.800
really escape his status, I think the move lifted some mandate to do work off his shoulders,

28:43.800 --> 28:47.960
but otherwise he was still the centre of attention, particularly as now I have a Twitter user. He also

28:47.960 --> 28:51.880
wasn't really much of a professional when it came to his content, this wasn't an insult really,

28:51.880 --> 28:56.600
but as you know many companies make their public representation as bereft in personality as

28:56.600 --> 29:00.600
possible. Notch always presented himself as a friend of the user, unlike a lot of large

29:00.600 --> 29:04.520
companies, his stance on piracy was mostly different, occasionally even encouraging people.

29:04.520 --> 29:08.920
He resented large companies for their acquisitions such as Google taking over YouTube, he came across

29:08.920 --> 29:14.200
as a video game populist, but I think having such stances is always going to come with his perils.

29:14.200 --> 29:18.280
Notch was still a significant force in a lot of decisions made around Mojang. Sure he wasn't the

29:18.280 --> 29:22.440
number one guy for design, but as I'm sure he found out soon enough, running a company came with

29:22.440 --> 29:26.520
more than enough baggage of its own, and eventually although you can find his position as an advocate

29:27.080 --> 29:31.480
respectable, you soon realise why a lot of companies don't have that sort of representation.

29:32.120 --> 29:36.120
Ultimately, Notch still bore the brunt of the decisions made by the company, even ones not

29:36.120 --> 29:40.040
made by himself, so he was regularly bombarded with requests that he could not fulfil without

29:40.040 --> 29:43.960
going over Jeff's head, something that he had pledged not to do, however if he didn't enact

29:43.960 --> 29:48.120
those changes he'd be subject to a litany of rather unpleasant words, something that he took

29:48.120 --> 29:51.960
more personally than he should have. He was an inherently high stress person who wanted to solve

29:51.960 --> 29:56.360
every person's issue, but knew he shouldn't. Being the video game populist isn't easy when

29:56.360 --> 30:00.360
he was no longer the friendly game developer behind the screen, and had a multi-million dollar

30:00.360 --> 30:04.840
franchise to oversee. In the end Notch became much more preoccupied with covering the decisions

30:04.840 --> 30:08.600
that concerned business, sometimes dealing with complaints from large companies who weren't happy

30:08.600 --> 30:12.120
that people were recreating their content in Minecraft. On the other side, people were

30:12.120 --> 30:15.960
dissatisfied every time he made an executive decision that people felt may have affected a

30:15.960 --> 30:20.200
player's in-game experience, even if it was one he felt was the right thing to do or absolutely

30:20.200 --> 30:24.520
necessary. The sandbox format, which in many ways with the game's core appeal also began to

30:24.520 --> 30:28.440
generate some controversy of its own over the years, now in many ways what happens in a game

30:28.440 --> 30:32.600
like Minecraft is a player's own discretion, and developers can't be expected to intervene in every

30:32.600 --> 30:36.280
server that offends people's sensibilities, particularly on a game with the number of servers

30:36.280 --> 30:41.000
that Minecraft has. However, as the antics became more and more far-fetched, pressure began to mount

30:41.000 --> 30:47.480
ultimately climaxing in a situation regarding in-game transactions. It was mid-2014, summer was

30:47.480 --> 30:52.040
approaching quickly, but it was not all sunshine on the Minecraft servers. Discourse had flared up

30:52.040 --> 30:56.440
on Twitter, as it always does, on the issue of donating to servers that offer certain services.

30:56.440 --> 31:00.520
Responding to this, Mojang spokesperson Owen Hill explained that although people are more than

31:00.520 --> 31:04.600
welcome to donate to servers, it couldn't be an exchange for equipment that gave you an in-game

31:04.600 --> 31:09.560
advantage. Soft pay-to-win essentially. However, many users didn't agree with this and began a

31:09.560 --> 31:14.760
hashtag titled SaveMinecraft. Although this stance was not new for Mojang, they were not known to

31:14.760 --> 31:18.840
have enforced it, and this newfound attention drew ire from many users, who felt there were

31:18.840 --> 31:23.880
many good servers whose existence relied on such transactions. Not frustrated by the decision

31:23.880 --> 31:28.040
surrounding the topic did what he did best, and took to his personal blog to write a response

31:28.040 --> 31:31.800
explaining his perspective, and explained that nothing had changed. This had always been their

31:31.800 --> 31:36.760
stance on the matter, as written in the EULA, the End User Licence Agreement. They did not want to

31:36.760 --> 31:41.480
sacrifice the don't pay for the gameplay principle that had motivated them all this time. Nevertheless,

31:41.480 --> 31:45.880
the user base did not subside, some of whom pointing towards the recent Minecraft Realms

31:45.880 --> 31:50.200
release as being a motivating factor for Mojang's decision to turn their attention towards other

31:50.200 --> 31:54.360
paid servers. Realms was launched the month before, and allowed a person to pay £8 a month

31:54.360 --> 31:58.680
to have private servers for up to 20 friends. This large-scale service drew comparisons that

31:58.680 --> 32:03.480
maybe Minecraft was trying to decrease competition, not truly acting in the interest of users,

32:03.480 --> 32:08.360
which likely provoked a more cynical response from gamers. Notch from his perspective clearly

32:08.360 --> 32:12.280
felt like he was doing the right thing, and he always took a lot of pride in it. He was always

32:12.280 --> 32:16.360
facing off with the sect of people who believed he was acting in his own self-interest, and with

32:16.360 --> 32:21.560
the large-scale movement against the decision that he felt was pretty cut and dry was the final straw.

32:21.560 --> 32:26.360
So on the 16th of June, a frustrated and enraged Notch typed out a tweet in the heat of the moment,

32:27.240 --> 32:29.080
and everything changed.

32:38.360 --> 32:47.000
Anyone want to buy my share of Mojang so I can move on with my life? Getting hate for

32:47.000 --> 32:51.400
trying to do the right thing is not my gig. The tweet in question wasn't a serious business

32:51.400 --> 32:55.720
proposition, but it did catch the attention of a few serious businesses, who contacted Notch's

32:55.720 --> 33:00.040
colleagues and asked him if he was for real. At first unsure, the idea of being able to completely

33:00.040 --> 33:05.160
disassociate from all the burdens he felt saddled with began to inspire some ideas. Every major

33:05.160 --> 33:09.320
company knew the cash cow that Mojang was, a business with less than 50 employees, yet

33:09.320 --> 33:13.320
generating hundreds of millions in revenue each year. It was a corporate wet dream, and if they

33:13.320 --> 33:17.160
were going to sell, there was hardly a gaming behemoth that didn't want a slice. However,

33:17.160 --> 33:21.320
it didn't take too long for the frontrunner to emerge. That frontrunner was the humble,

33:21.320 --> 33:24.280
full-scale firm known as Microsoft.

33:24.280 --> 33:29.160
So how do you run your Minecraft company? Have you sold out to the evil corporations yet?

33:29.880 --> 33:31.320
No, not yet. We hope not to.

33:31.320 --> 33:35.080
Now, to be fair, the company had to be somewhat large to even afford to buy out the shares on

33:35.080 --> 33:39.000
offer. We'll get to the price of the deal in a bit, but Notch wanted a company who were in

33:39.000 --> 33:43.400
touch with the preservation of what made Minecraft special. He had dealt with Microsoft before,

33:43.400 --> 33:47.320
occasionally expressing frustration with their practices, but regularly also demonstrating

33:47.320 --> 33:51.480
affection for those who he worked with to bring Minecraft to their platforms, even at some points

33:51.480 --> 33:56.120
promoting rumours of an exclusivity deal, which he seemed to sarcastically refer to. All I can

33:56.120 --> 34:00.360
affirmatively say is they were probably a better choice to Notch than EA. With this in mind,

34:00.360 --> 34:04.760
Microsoft moved in to close the deal. They had the additional motive of the ever wholesome subject

34:04.760 --> 34:09.480
of tax avoidance due to our functioning economic system, a deal with Mojang would facilitate.

34:09.480 --> 34:13.320
You'd love to see it. So they were prepared to offer the big bucks, and when I say big,

34:13.320 --> 34:17.960
I mean hard to even quantify. Person's shares totaled just shy of 1.8 billion dollars,

34:17.960 --> 34:23.160
Paul's shares around 300 million, and then CEO Carl Manet's shares 100 million,

34:23.160 --> 34:27.720
not your average shopping bill to say the least. This was all finalised and officially announced

34:27.720 --> 34:33.320
on the 15th of September 2014, with a post on Notch's Tumblr titled I'm Leaving Mojang,

34:33.320 --> 34:37.240
which goes more into depth about how interactions with his user base had shaped his current

34:37.240 --> 34:41.320
perspective. He already knew he would never be able to recreate a success like Minecraft,

34:41.320 --> 34:45.560
but wanted to stay on as the figurehead because he believed there was some symbolic value to that.

34:45.560 --> 34:50.040
Javi came to the conclusion that he didn't enjoy it, he was just really this space on a game that

34:50.040 --> 34:53.800
he didn't really feel attached to anymore, a source of people's enjoyment and pain that he

34:53.800 --> 34:58.120
didn't understand. In his words, he's merely a nerdy computer programmer who likes to have

34:58.120 --> 35:01.960
opinions on Twitter. Although the money was nothing to turn your nose at, he stresses that

35:01.960 --> 35:06.360
it wasn't about the money, it was about the sanity. I wonder how people would respond to that.

35:07.000 --> 35:10.680
Well, most of them took it pretty well actually, there were a few people who regarded him as a

35:10.680 --> 35:14.520
sellout, but he'd been called a sellout by plenty of people in his time, and that wasn't anything

35:14.520 --> 35:18.120
new. It was obviously difficult for some people to rationalise given that the person had always

35:18.120 --> 35:22.840
been outspoken about a lot of the threatening overreach of big tech, but his move wasn't really

35:22.840 --> 35:27.000
one for any of the companies, it wasn't an endorsement of such, it was just what he thought

35:27.000 --> 35:31.960
was best for himself, he had to get out, and that was his way. Among other people affected by this

35:31.960 --> 35:36.520
were the members of staff, upon learning on his departure they were reported to be disappointed,

35:36.520 --> 35:40.920
and that makes sense especially given they were now under the gaze of a much more cutthroat company,

35:40.920 --> 35:44.760
but Notch had taken steps to ensure that no layoffs would occur, which given the modest

35:44.760 --> 35:49.400
numbers of Mojang's workforce, Microsoft were happy to abide by. All staff members who remained

35:49.400 --> 35:53.880
at the company for the next six months also received a $300,000 bonus from Notch's share,

35:53.880 --> 35:57.720
which obviously wasn't anything near the levels of money Marcus had been paid, but it wasn't

35:57.720 --> 36:02.040
derisory either. It was generally reported that Microsoft mostly took a hands-off approach and

36:02.040 --> 36:05.960
merely offered their resources and investment to the team over at Mojang in exchange for the

36:05.960 --> 36:10.040
profits they were making. Overall it was considered by most to be an example of a transaction done

36:10.040 --> 36:14.040
right, one that didn't lead to the immediate demise of a product or those who worked tirelessly

36:14.040 --> 36:18.360
on it. At the same time, although you'd be hard-pressed not to understand Person's viewpoint,

36:18.360 --> 36:22.360
it's hard not to feel a bit solemn about the circumstances that precipitated it.

36:22.440 --> 36:27.080
Although Person's tenure probably did centralise his status a bit too much, I mean hell, he once

36:27.080 --> 36:31.720
placed above Barack Obama in a time person of the year poll. His success was still an inspiration to

36:31.720 --> 36:36.360
many, he'd become representative of an individual creative using the online world to make something

36:36.360 --> 36:41.720
greater than any major studio could ever concoct, and his concern for personally involving himself

36:41.720 --> 36:46.040
in creating a consumer-based experience felt refreshing for many who played the game. It

36:46.040 --> 36:50.520
created a community with an identifiable figure at the centre of it. His departure didn't mean

36:50.520 --> 36:54.280
the game was suddenly going to take a nosedive, and in a way some people's fallacious belief that

36:54.280 --> 36:58.200
he was one of the key factors in maintaining the game's appeal was disproven after he left,

36:58.200 --> 37:02.360
but it did reduce the power of the community on a large company who isn't really known for their

37:02.360 --> 37:07.240
consumer empowerment. Eventually those aspects of corporatism were going to seep in, and there'd

37:07.240 --> 37:12.600
be nothing that anyone could do about it. Sometimes it's nice just to have someone there to listen.

37:12.600 --> 37:16.680
Ultimately this was all rooted in a situation though where the person who listened had heard

37:16.680 --> 37:20.920
enough. Anyone who cares that much about a game is not going to be able to withstand the pressure

37:20.920 --> 37:25.480
of maintaining it. Minecraft was one person's passion that became so much greater than that.

37:25.480 --> 37:29.480
In Notch's statement he writes, if I ever accidentally make something that seems to gain

37:29.480 --> 37:33.880
traction, I'll probably abandon it immediately. Some people may have been able to navigate the

37:33.880 --> 37:38.920
tricky social environment better, but Notch was not that person, he never was. That's what made

37:38.920 --> 37:43.240
him popular, that's what made him like, he was the everyman, he was the underdog who rose up to change

37:43.240 --> 37:47.160
the gaming industry, he didn't have politically adept social skills or a decade-long college

37:47.160 --> 37:51.640
education, he was a guy who just did what he felt like doing. He showed that the stereotype

37:51.640 --> 37:56.280
for the nerd staying in his room on his computer wasn't as negative as some thought it to be.

37:56.280 --> 38:00.120
In the end the popularity made his status untenable though, he couldn't be everybody's

38:00.120 --> 38:04.040
everyman, but he still walked away from a game that would revere him as one of the greatest

38:04.040 --> 38:08.520
examples of independent enterprise in modern history. Well, he could have.

38:13.240 --> 38:21.640
Marcus Persson was rich, and everyone knew it.

38:21.640 --> 38:26.040
It's hard not to let success change you in some way, and often you should change with success,

38:26.040 --> 38:29.640
because it typically places you in a different position than one you were in previously.

38:29.640 --> 38:33.640
Even if you didn't intend on becoming famous, if you're going to continue operating in that

38:33.640 --> 38:38.280
domain you have to adapt. While he was working on Minecraft, Notch seemed hesitant to do that.

38:38.280 --> 38:43.000
In 2011 he made over 100 million dollars, and his response to questions on how he was going

38:43.000 --> 38:47.880
to spend it was perhaps obtaining a driver's license and a car, almost comedically modest.

38:47.880 --> 38:52.200
When he did splash out it was only really with other people, such as work trips and conventions.

38:52.200 --> 38:56.280
He obviously cared less about his shopping bill than most, but he never seemed to let that wealth

38:56.280 --> 39:01.000
distract him from the lifestyle he was accustomed to. However, the sale of his shares in Minecraft

39:01.000 --> 39:04.680
changed that, not just because it earned him an obscene amount of money at once, but because it

39:04.760 --> 39:09.320
removed a commitment that he had felt attached to for years. As long as he was tied to that game,

39:09.320 --> 39:13.160
no matter how much money he made, Notch seemed almost paranoid that it could still collapse

39:13.160 --> 39:17.000
at any moment. He waited over a year to fully quit his job, despite the fact that Minecraft

39:17.000 --> 39:21.880
was generating far more income. Even when success seemed near guaranteed, Notch felt the reputation

39:21.880 --> 39:26.040
of a game weighing on his actions. That was gone now, and he had all the time to do what he wanted

39:26.040 --> 39:32.120
to. Well, what would he do? He decided to treat himself, it seems. First on his list of goodies

39:32.120 --> 39:36.360
was a new abode. Person went for the ever popular celebrity location in Beverly Hills,

39:36.360 --> 39:41.640
spending 70 million dollars and outbidding Jay-Z and Beyonce on a 23,000 square foot mansion with

39:41.640 --> 39:46.440
its own carlift. How quaint. It was soon reported that he had been spending his nights in Las Vegas

39:46.440 --> 39:50.920
blowing upwards of 100k in a single outing to the nightclubs, casinos, and the rest. In interviews,

39:50.920 --> 39:55.320
his mantra appeared that he was making up for lost time, and everything he was never able to do as a

39:55.320 --> 39:59.240
young adult working his ass off in the industry. He acknowledged that it wasn't the wisest way to

39:59.240 --> 40:03.720
spend one's fortunes, but it was for him. He was living the high life, that much is true,

40:03.720 --> 40:09.880
private rooftop pools, crystal champagne, and Skrillex, the ultimate triad. This was all shared

40:09.880 --> 40:13.640
through his Twitter and Instagram, which now served a very different purpose for Notch, and

40:13.640 --> 40:17.800
his attitude certainly reflected that. When people tried to dunk on him, he'd regularly respond with

40:17.800 --> 40:21.480
memes and lighthearted jives to show that ultimately, whatever people said wouldn't change

40:21.480 --> 40:25.480
where he was at with life. In spite of all this, he had pledged to donate a fair sum of his money

40:25.480 --> 40:30.200
to charity, and set some aside for family, but life is more than what you want to do with money.

40:30.760 --> 40:36.600
What other plans did he have? Well, it appeared uncertain. On the 3rd of March 2015,

40:36.600 --> 40:40.840
an interview was published with Forbes that delved into the headspace of Notch following the sale.

40:40.840 --> 40:45.160
It reported that he had since started a new company known as Rubberbrain, located in central

40:45.160 --> 40:48.760
Stockholm. Him and his colleagues had been throwing around some new ideas and occasionally

40:48.760 --> 40:52.760
testing them, but mostly just trying to have a good time. Whatever their plans were, it wasn't

40:52.760 --> 40:56.920
to create a new blockbuster. On the question of his place in the current gaming environment,

40:56.920 --> 41:00.920
he didn't really know where he wanted to be, but one thing was certain, that he hadn't regretted

41:00.920 --> 41:06.120
selling his shares, he just wanted to pass away the days having a good time with his friends.

41:06.120 --> 41:10.760
But how long would that last? I have a good friend who posted a principle in a philosophical

41:10.760 --> 41:15.160
discussion we were having a few months ago, the necessity of human struggle. His argument

41:15.160 --> 41:20.200
basically suggested that we as people need to experience some aspect of adversity to truly feel

41:20.200 --> 41:25.000
fulfilled. He likened it to a room that closes in on a person, the idea that many of us need those

41:25.000 --> 41:29.240
walls to push back against, something of a challenge, or what else if we ultimately lose our

41:29.240 --> 41:33.240
own purpose in the world. Now obviously some people struggle far too much, and other people

41:33.240 --> 41:37.080
get by alright without struggling, but I think there is a relevance, particularly for people who

41:37.080 --> 41:41.720
are used to some form of pressure, to have that completely removed from them. It's a very difficult

41:41.720 --> 41:45.960
environment to adapt to. Struggle is relative, and if you've spent your whole life with this strong

41:45.960 --> 41:50.440
sense of purpose, to have yourself completely absolved of that purpose is quite jarring,

41:50.440 --> 41:54.760
and barely a few months after the Forbes article was published, Notch's celebratory tone appeared

41:54.760 --> 41:59.880
to take a turn towards something more pessimistic. On August the 29th, Notch sent out a series of

41:59.880 --> 42:03.480
tweets that appeared to lament his current lifestyle, initiating with the statement,

42:03.480 --> 42:07.720
the problem with getting everything is you run out of reasons to keep trying, and human interaction

42:07.720 --> 42:12.120
becomes impossible due to imbalance. Notch then proceeds to talk about how although he has

42:12.120 --> 42:16.440
everything, he feels completely alienated, unable to create a human connection with those around

42:16.440 --> 42:21.240
him, especially on an intimate basis as people find his lifestyle overwhelming. He also seems

42:21.240 --> 42:25.000
frustrated at the fact that many of his former colleagues still seem to resent him, despite

42:25.000 --> 42:29.080
him believing that he treated them well. When one of the employees says that much of the response

42:29.080 --> 42:33.720
was just the initial shock, he completely flips out on them, saying fuck all of you, which seemed

42:33.720 --> 42:38.840
a bit much for many people at the time. He had no trust for the world around him, and it shows.

42:38.840 --> 42:42.920
The mail cloud may have been momentary for many, but it certainly outlined a real cloud to the

42:42.920 --> 42:47.640
silver lining of selling out. Unfortunately Notch had reached this stage of success and influence

42:47.640 --> 42:51.720
where people treat you differently because of it. Even people close to you can seem distant,

42:51.720 --> 42:56.520
and you can't really trust their intent. You need mental fortitude to manage that, and to be frank,

42:56.520 --> 43:02.120
Marcus was a somewhat fragile person, and once the initial euphoria of that newfound wealth wore out,

43:02.120 --> 43:07.080
he probably wondered what was left. This brief tirade inspired a few reports and response articles

43:07.080 --> 43:11.160
from people who didn't necessarily have great sympathy for his predicament, but probably prompted

43:11.160 --> 43:15.960
the same suggestion for a solution. Person needed to find a way to alienate himself from that wealth

43:15.960 --> 43:21.400
and status. It's not an easy solution to undertake, but the problem will continue to be inescapable as

43:21.400 --> 43:25.720
long as he had nothing to work for and nobody to actually share it with. Snoop Dogg even weighed

43:25.720 --> 43:30.200
in on the matter, reminding persons that knowing who your real ones are is much more important than

43:30.200 --> 43:35.080
any material wealth. I don't think anyone needs Notch's level of money to be happy. You shouldn't

43:35.080 --> 43:38.840
have to give away your wealth to be happy necessarily, but you need to have something that can

43:38.840 --> 43:44.120
transcend the purpose of that money, whether that be friends, work, or an alternative outlet. Reflecting

43:44.120 --> 43:49.000
on Notch's life, maybe his purpose was rooted in a struggle of sorts with Minecraft, and optimizing

43:49.000 --> 43:54.360
it, and now that it ended, so had Person's own greater sense of self. Marcus Person was rich,

43:54.360 --> 43:58.760
and everyone knew it, but for someone like him, that was seeming more like a curse and a blessing,

43:58.760 --> 44:03.320
and his rant, although aggressive, was to show great vulnerability. He needed something greater

44:03.320 --> 44:06.120
to latch on to, but maybe we got something worse.

44:13.640 --> 44:17.640
A few days after his venting session on the social media website, Notch decided to respond

44:17.640 --> 44:21.800
to those who suggested that he give his wealth away, stating that money wasn't the problem,

44:21.800 --> 44:26.280
it was the lifestyle, and although he may not be wrong, if you let your money influence your

44:26.280 --> 44:30.360
lifestyle then you're feeding the problem, and less than a couple months later he was back in

44:30.360 --> 44:35.480
Vegas. He seemed to attribute his current downcast mindset to the success, but he'd been successful

44:35.480 --> 44:39.640
for a while, it was just that this time round he had something else to account for that success,

44:39.640 --> 44:44.120
and it simply wasn't enough. It distanced himself from nearly everyone in his life, and made him

44:44.120 --> 44:49.080
untrusting of the world around him. Notch was the paranoid wreck who had no idea of where he was

44:49.080 --> 44:53.080
meant to go from here, and expressing it online wasn't going to help, as the whole place can often

44:53.080 --> 44:57.000
feel like you're headed in circles. You'd think that after he sold his shares he'd have a lot less

44:57.000 --> 45:00.920
to say on the world wide web, but for someone who didn't want to be the centre of attention anymore,

45:00.920 --> 45:05.560
he often still seemed obsessed with social media platforms. In his departure post he characterised

45:05.560 --> 45:09.800
himself as a nerdy computer programmer who likes to have opinions on Twitter, but it seemed more

45:09.800 --> 45:14.120
than just the occasional hot takes at this point, to be honest he seemed ever more invested with the

45:14.120 --> 45:18.440
goings on around him, and that only continued to manifest itself as the online world became

45:18.440 --> 45:23.560
increasingly political. As we all know, 2016 was a strange time for the internet on reflection,

45:23.560 --> 45:29.000
particularly with the cosmic rise of Donald Trump, and the general movement towards anti-SJW content

45:29.000 --> 45:33.160
that seemed to target people who were not always the best at expressing their beliefs. When working

45:33.160 --> 45:37.800
on Minecraft, Notch had generally seemed to adopt quite progressive ideas towards his game. Although

45:37.800 --> 45:41.720
not overtly political, he said that every character was genderless, and that people had a right to

45:41.720 --> 45:45.960
interpret each of them to their own liking. It was part of Minecraft after all, the fact that

45:45.960 --> 45:50.440
an individual can have an experience personal to them. Despite not explicitly endorsing anyone

45:50.440 --> 45:54.840
before 2016, Notch was someone who would have been mostly aware of the discourse within political

45:54.840 --> 45:59.240
spheres, and throughout 2015 he had mostly expressed disdain for the prospective Republican

45:59.240 --> 46:03.560
candidate, Donald Trump, calling him a loon, and exhibited genuine confusion at people's

46:03.560 --> 46:07.560
belief in his suitability for office. He'd interacted with a few YouTubers who expressed

46:07.560 --> 46:12.760
anti-SJW beliefs, and stated that he would support Bernie Sanders if choosing between him and Hillary.

46:12.760 --> 46:16.360
As the US election approached, he seemed to become more and more invested in the issue though.

46:16.360 --> 46:20.120
Although it is vocal that he was not a fan of Trump's, he turned most of his eye towards Hillary

46:20.120 --> 46:23.960
Clinton, who he felt had acted dishonestly. I'm not going to go into every single detail

46:23.960 --> 46:27.880
regarding his political beliefs at this specific point in time, but as election day approached,

46:27.880 --> 46:31.560
his stance on Trump continued to soften, and eventually he admitted that if he was forced

46:31.560 --> 46:35.560
to choose between Trump and Clinton, he would probably choose Trump. This wasn't an exceptional

46:35.560 --> 46:40.040
stance at the time, particularly online, people's resentment for Clinton was very palpable, and many

46:40.040 --> 46:44.200
didn't want her to win just for the principle that they thought the Democrats had the opportunity to

46:44.200 --> 46:48.920
present a genuinely radical candidate, well at least by the standards of US politics. Trump

46:48.920 --> 46:53.800
became the anti-hero, anti-establishment figure that in spite of his very visible flaws became

46:53.800 --> 46:58.120
a punishment to all those happy to settle for a miserable status quo, therefore although his

46:58.120 --> 47:02.840
opinions were a little outspoken for a person of his status, these didn't exactly strike anyone as

47:02.840 --> 47:07.160
truly frightening. I think establishment is a very important word to use when analysing these

47:07.160 --> 47:11.160
figures, because Notch is an independent game developer who cared deeply about the game he

47:11.160 --> 47:16.040
designed, similarly saw himself as a figure taking on the long entrenched bureaucracies and structures

47:16.120 --> 47:19.320
that they employed to stay in power. He'd always believed that many in the industry

47:19.320 --> 47:22.760
players sacrificed user experience for their own gain, and they would try and

47:22.760 --> 47:26.920
oppress any actual innovation. Notch was one of the few large gaming entrepreneurs who didn't

47:26.920 --> 47:31.480
outwardly attack masses like piracy, he was an advocate for the little guy in in-game experience.

47:31.480 --> 47:35.080
Additionally, he had always been largely skeptical of national governments, and expressed deep

47:35.080 --> 47:39.400
concern about a surveillance state, particularly that relating to the US. That is where we

47:39.400 --> 47:44.280
introduce the sort of SJW that he also seemed to rally against during the election of Donald Trump,

47:44.280 --> 47:48.840
additionally crediting their behaviour as much to the reason that the Don got elected. The sort

47:48.840 --> 47:53.240
of political correctness that many of them preached was not something Notch had ever related to.

47:53.240 --> 47:56.840
Sure, he wasn't the sort of person who was particularly offensive or hurtful to people,

47:56.840 --> 48:01.560
but he always saw issues like freedom of speech as being non-negotiable, he saw any attack on it as

48:01.560 --> 48:06.120
an act of tyranny, designed to oppress people who may speak truth to power. He wanted to fight

48:06.120 --> 48:11.160
against what he saw as this corporate sterilisation of people's expression. He was also becoming

48:11.160 --> 48:15.160
increasingly involved in issues relating to the treatment of quote white men, and the use of

48:15.160 --> 48:19.720
identity politics in general. Now, I wouldn't describe any of his positions as hateful, or even

48:19.720 --> 48:24.200
with the intent to do harm at this point. Sometimes I think he spoke from a point of genuine frustration

48:24.200 --> 48:28.680
towards toxic factions in many movements who were advocating for otherwise righteous causes.

48:28.680 --> 48:34.680
However, his frustration didn't subside in the year following, particularly with the online world further contorting.

48:35.480 --> 48:59.240
But why should it matter to someone like Marcus Person? The dude wasn't the target of this,

48:59.240 --> 49:03.320
and it's not like his freedom was being affected by it. Well at the start of 2017,

49:03.320 --> 49:07.720
a few large YouTubers, most notably PewDiePie came under scrutiny for their behaviour online.

49:07.720 --> 49:11.720
At the time, many who sympathised with these creators saw large corporations punching down

49:11.720 --> 49:15.720
on the freedom of expression previously held by many creators, whether or not the humour was in

49:15.720 --> 49:20.120
good taste. In particular, this sort of battle emerged all over the internet between traditional

49:20.120 --> 49:24.120
standards and the sort of wild west approach that other parts of the online world possessed,

49:24.120 --> 49:28.120
and how increasingly influential in modern culture they were becoming. The online world and their

49:28.120 --> 49:32.600
communities were facing down reproval from many angles, especially from those who felt it excluded

49:32.600 --> 49:37.080
and alienated marginalised groups who deserved a space as much as anyone else. This all then

49:37.080 --> 49:40.920
reached into the video game industry, particularly given the aftermath of the gamergate, something

49:40.920 --> 49:44.920
that Notch had previously stayed rather neutral on, but now seemed to feel quite strongly about.

49:44.920 --> 49:49.400
This criticism of the current online culture was often advocated by progressively identifying

49:49.400 --> 49:54.600
people, the SJWs per se, who were also vociferously anti-Trump. I think a fair few people who were

49:54.600 --> 49:59.240
attached to that sort of wild west of the internet drew a correlation between Trump and a specific way

49:59.240 --> 50:03.480
of online life, particularly that freedom of speech given how Trump was a pretty unfiltered

50:03.480 --> 50:08.040
person to say it lightly. Well, with infinite time and money, I guess Notch had finally found

50:08.040 --> 50:10.760
another struggle, but was this one worth fighting for?

50:20.760 --> 50:24.600
Marcus Person had always held a sort of morbid curiosity for these sorts of areas,

50:24.600 --> 50:28.680
discussing the often contentious 4chan in an early interview, he describes it as possibly

50:28.680 --> 50:33.320
being one of the closest things we've got to a self-conscious virtual entity on the internet,

50:33.320 --> 50:37.720
even referencing it in an old intro screen for the game. In many ways, that sort of independent

50:37.720 --> 50:41.960
minded section of the internet was what put Minecraft on the map, and so it wasn't completely

50:41.960 --> 50:46.520
beyond belief why he felt protective about it. I think in many ways, people like Notch saw these

50:46.520 --> 50:50.360
establishment types coming in and trying to dictate their own standards that much of the

50:50.360 --> 50:54.280
internet didn't perceive similarly. I think it's fair to say that although Notch's opinions on the

50:54.280 --> 50:58.120
matters in the previous part weren't completely out of nowhere given his background, they were

50:58.120 --> 51:02.280
somewhat different to many around him at the time, and it definitely alienated some people.

51:02.280 --> 51:06.120
When someone asked him why it seemed like everyone hated him now, he replied they didn't hate him,

51:06.120 --> 51:09.800
they agreed, but were just afraid to speak up, and as what he said received pushback,

51:09.800 --> 51:14.600
he became more and more stubborn, and in turn more and more irrational. Even if he agreed with

51:14.600 --> 51:18.680
any point he was making, it was lost in the sense that he was fighting a greater cultural battle.

51:18.680 --> 51:22.920
When an incident occurred at VidCon involving Anita Sarkeesian clashing heads with her critics,

51:22.920 --> 51:27.800
and Ant Green responding, he tagged Green telling him to be on the right side of history.

51:27.800 --> 51:31.960
That's a strong term for a situation that related to a commentary spat at a panel. At the end of

51:31.960 --> 51:36.600
Pride Month in 2017, there was a movement called Heterosexual Pride Day. Notch noticed this and

51:36.600 --> 51:40.920
stated that if you didn't support it, you deserve to be shot. Eventually, he did retract this

51:40.920 --> 51:44.920
statement and apologise, but it was clear that he was taking this all a little too seriously.

51:44.920 --> 51:48.920
It was clear that this was a historic battle to person for the soul of society, and this seemed

51:48.920 --> 51:54.200
to be influencing his political beliefs as well. In a May 2017 interview, then President Donald

51:54.200 --> 51:58.280
Trump made the bold claim that he invented the phrase priming the pump, which is particularly

51:58.280 --> 52:02.840
impressive given that in modern terms, it was first applied in the 1930s, the decade before

52:02.840 --> 52:07.080
Trump was born. Mockery ensued, and many people took to their favourite social media site to take

52:07.080 --> 52:11.800
the piss, including video game writer and YouTube critic Mikey Newman. Person after having the

52:11.800 --> 52:15.960
reference explained to him makes the judgment that it is just more baseless Trump bashing because

52:15.960 --> 52:20.120
they are afraid, which certainly prompted some confusion. It seemed that as the months passed,

52:20.120 --> 52:24.360
Notch had become more preoccupied with his idea that every narrative against Trump was part of

52:24.360 --> 52:29.160
some great conspiracy to prevent him from making America great again, and well, it's a bit far

52:29.160 --> 52:33.560
fetched. The thing about a lot of conspiracy theories is that they do often start with one

52:33.560 --> 52:37.960
genuine observation. Were certain echelons of the media disproportionately outraged with Trump's

52:37.960 --> 52:41.960
presidency when they'd given others a pass? You could make an argument for it. You could say that

52:41.960 --> 52:46.040
they weren't anywhere near as critical as previous presidencies when they enacted policy that could

52:46.040 --> 52:50.200
significantly harm a population. However, the fallacious link comes when you conclude that

52:50.200 --> 52:53.880
therefore they hate Trump because he's finally doing the right thing, rather than the fact that

52:53.880 --> 52:58.120
he's unorthodox and generates views for financially focused businesses. There were plenty of people

52:58.120 --> 53:01.800
online who were quite aware of establishment's shortcomings, but also felt like it was still

53:01.800 --> 53:05.720
bad to point out issues regarding Trump. When he makes a claim that he invented a term that

53:05.720 --> 53:09.800
existed before he was born, then yeah, I don't think it's unjustified to have a bit of a chuckle

53:09.800 --> 53:14.360
about it. However, Notch didn't seem to be seeing it this way, and neither were a lot of Americans.

53:14.360 --> 53:18.120
So with that in mind, let's talk about a little conspiracy theory that occurred the year before,

53:18.120 --> 53:22.840
known as Pizzagate. Pizzagate was the allegation that there was an insidious, satanic underground

53:22.840 --> 53:27.800
sex ring being operated by the Clintons and Democrats out of a Washington DC pizzeria. It was

53:27.800 --> 53:32.440
rooted in an email link from a Clinton campaigner which theorists claimed contained a secret code

53:32.440 --> 53:36.760
that tied all of this together, and eventually resulted in a gunman turning up to the pizzeria

53:36.760 --> 53:40.840
and firing his rifle at the institution. There were deluge of other related incidents to the

53:40.840 --> 53:45.000
theory which has widely been discredited by mainstream institutions, emphasis on the

53:45.000 --> 53:49.160
mainstream institutions here. Now that's not to say it has credit, I personally don't think it does,

53:49.160 --> 53:52.760
but when you believe a theory that dictates all authority figures are in on something,

53:52.760 --> 53:57.880
them telling you it doesn't exist isn't going to be convincing enough. Pizzagate mostly fizzled out

53:57.880 --> 54:03.480
after the 2016 election, particularly given that Donald Trump actually won, but in August 2017,

54:03.480 --> 54:07.960
Notch published a tweet stating that in fact, Pizzagate was real. A bit late to the party,

54:07.960 --> 54:11.560
all things considered, but quite the claim regardless. In elaborating on his stance,

54:11.560 --> 54:15.560
he rants about binary politics, and how there might actually be pieces of evidence that have

54:15.560 --> 54:19.880
supported this theory, but that it might also be drugs, though the pedestrians do look like people

54:19.880 --> 54:25.400
in a police sketch, and the pizza place has weird art and branding, etc. There were already a lot of

54:25.400 --> 54:30.200
retorts online to the claims made in Notch's very long thread, but he seems certain something is up,

54:30.200 --> 54:34.200
and although people may perceive his thread as being a bit behind the current political discourse,

54:34.200 --> 54:38.120
it may not have been as unprompted as some people thought. On the forums like 4chan,

54:38.120 --> 54:42.440
this narrative had been brewing, but one that integrated a new perspective, that Donald Trump

54:42.440 --> 54:46.840
was aware, and working to bring this worldwide satanic cabal down, and there would only be a

54:46.840 --> 54:51.160
matter of time until many significant public figures were reprimanded and charged. Similar

54:51.160 --> 54:55.400
versions of this story had already been promoted on the polls section of 4chan, but come October

54:55.400 --> 55:00.200
this began to escalate. On the 27th of the aforementioned month, a user by the name of

55:00.200 --> 55:04.760
QClarencePatriot claimed that Hillary Clinton was soon going to be arrested, and civil unrest

55:04.760 --> 55:08.840
would follow. QClarence is a level of clearance used for the Department of Energy, it gives you

55:08.840 --> 55:12.680
access to a variety of data that would otherwise be restricted to the public, the inference here

55:12.680 --> 55:16.280
being that this guy was someone high up in government, and he was speaking out due to his

55:16.280 --> 55:20.280
patriotic nature. This seemed to capture the imagination for many in the forum, and was

55:20.280 --> 55:24.120
followed quickly by another post that seemed to incriminate other popular democratic figureheads

55:24.120 --> 55:27.880
and donors, implying that there would soon be a large-scale reckoning for all those who Trump

55:27.960 --> 55:32.040
viewed as criminal rogue elements. This would quickly manifest and grow, receiving more and

55:32.040 --> 55:36.040
more media attention, and garnering a following from many committed Trump devotees. I think what

55:36.040 --> 55:40.200
happens to many people is the feeling of a greater cause and explanation for Trump's actions. He had

55:40.200 --> 55:44.120
always pledged to drain the swamp, and deliver justice to a system that legitimately been rigged

55:44.120 --> 55:48.920
against so many people. Q himself occupied this position of unfalsifiability, whose content could

55:48.920 --> 55:53.480
only be proven by time, and often leveraged on the belief of the individual, and it turned out that

55:53.480 --> 55:57.640
many were actually quite prepared to believe. Although Notch was not necessarily directly

55:57.640 --> 56:01.320
involved with anything QAnon related in its inception, and there's no direct evidence

56:01.320 --> 56:05.000
tying him to that, the correlation between his interest in Pizzagate and the founding of this

56:05.000 --> 56:08.840
sector of the internet seemed to imply that he was spending a bit too much time in these forums,

56:08.840 --> 56:12.840
and as he became more and more outspoken, people began to take notice.

56:24.360 --> 56:27.880
Make no mistake, Notch had definitely been pushing people's buttons online, but overall,

56:27.880 --> 56:31.560
this hadn't affected his status related to his work at this point, likely because most of his

56:31.560 --> 56:35.480
tweets didn't have much staying power online, and people didn't really care enough about some dude

56:35.480 --> 56:39.960
shouting into the void. He held steadfast on most of his opinions, but up to the end of 2018,

56:39.960 --> 56:44.120
he didn't seem to garner much attention outside the discourse sphere that he was involved in.

56:44.120 --> 56:47.880
However, there was the occasional reference to Operation Mockingbird, a theory that refers to

56:47.880 --> 56:51.800
the alleged brainwashing of the public through media propaganda, and had been regularly mentioned

56:51.800 --> 56:56.760
by those on QAnon, and Q himself who mentions it in his original post. Although it never attracted

56:56.760 --> 57:01.000
that much media attention, it was indicative of what he was doing with his time. However,

57:01.000 --> 57:04.920
as Notch's takes grew increasingly strong, there was a sense that what he was saying couldn't be

57:04.920 --> 57:09.480
ignored. This began in December 2018, which was met with a flurry of statements by person,

57:09.480 --> 57:13.640
some relating to race, some relating to general political identity, and just some relating to

57:13.640 --> 57:17.560
whatever the hell this is. He still presented himself as someone on the side of the little guy,

57:17.560 --> 57:21.400
but it seems he had identified a greater battle against those who were at the top, and the far

57:21.400 --> 57:25.880
left who were controlling every aspect of his life. If you were with them, you were ontologically

57:25.880 --> 57:29.960
evil. There was no two ways about it. Now, these tweets were definitely more concerning than the

57:29.960 --> 57:33.640
previous sets. The least you could say about his comments up to this point was that although they

57:33.640 --> 57:38.120
were often provocative, the intended targets were often general concepts of political correctness,

57:38.120 --> 57:42.840
SJWs, and establishment figures, all of which were not without their flaws, even if the obsession

57:42.840 --> 57:47.000
with them was a bit overwrought on Notch's behalf. However, these tweets seem to harp on some other

57:47.000 --> 57:50.600
more questionable theories, in particular relating to IQ differences between racial

57:50.600 --> 57:54.840
populations. Now, this has been the subject of debate in certain scientific circles, with many

57:54.840 --> 57:59.480
broadly on the side of the opinion that IQ is not affected by race, more due to other environmental

57:59.480 --> 58:03.960
factors that may coincide with race. However, how does a human generated spectrum of intelligence

58:03.960 --> 58:08.120
help discussion on racial differences? How would it dictate the world we live in? The truth is that

58:08.120 --> 58:13.320
people are still individuals, and anyone from any race can be really smart or really stupid.

58:13.320 --> 58:17.240
Notch had clearly grown to hate the general state of the gaming industry, as he felt it was dictated

58:17.240 --> 58:21.400
by a small proportion of easily offended people. The left received a lot of the blame when companies

58:21.400 --> 58:24.920
made decisions that others thought they were being pressured into, but many of them were decisions

58:24.920 --> 58:28.520
ultimately made by the company. What would anyone who actually felt strongly about these matters

58:28.520 --> 58:32.360
done if the businesses in this industry just turned around to them and said no we're not doing

58:32.360 --> 58:36.360
that, or just ignored them? Probably not much, maybe some angry tweets, but that would be it.

58:36.360 --> 58:40.040
And Notch has survived alright to this point. Despite the fact that he didn't have direct ties

58:40.040 --> 58:43.880
to any companies, he was still symbolically associated with Minecraft and commemorated in

58:43.880 --> 58:48.840
the game. However, come March 2019, Notch was once again ready to test that, and this time he was

58:48.840 --> 58:53.240
going all out. First mentioning Operation Mockingbird again, but then dropping any innuendo

58:53.240 --> 58:57.480
and just outwardly stating that Q was legit, and that we should not be trusting the media.

58:57.480 --> 59:01.160
To be honest, I don't trust the media too much either, but for someone who doesn't like binary

59:01.160 --> 59:05.400
politics, he sure likes to make binary choices. After a couple days of continuing to push these

59:05.400 --> 59:09.320
general narratives that the populace was being lied to by the establishment, he takes it to it

59:09.320 --> 59:13.240
to make the interesting observation that suddenly all the requests for him to stream and podcast

59:13.240 --> 59:17.560
have stopped. How curious, I guess the establishment decided that his time was none,

59:17.560 --> 59:21.720
but his Twitter was still growing, which is something I guess. I mean, he was making up to

59:21.720 --> 59:26.360
100 tweets a day. With Notch fully embracing the QAnon movement and the man behind it,

59:26.360 --> 59:29.960
he definitely raised a few eyebrows, with articles being published on his recent turn to

59:29.960 --> 59:34.120
conspiracy theories. However, not finished to his crusade, he turns his attention to a variety of

59:34.120 --> 59:38.040
matters, first drawing a comparison between dressing as another race and dressing as the

59:38.040 --> 59:41.880
opposite gender, and saying there is no difference. This opinion didn't seem to attract

59:41.880 --> 59:45.960
too much traffic, as it could be seen as referring to cross-dressing. However, not too long after,

59:45.960 --> 59:49.560
Notch was back to business on a plethora of fronts, sometimes posting rather vaguely,

59:49.560 --> 59:53.480
which attracted some QAnon responses, other times just cutting the chase and reminding

59:53.480 --> 59:57.640
people that casual murdering of infants for organ harvesting purposes is not acceptable.

59:57.640 --> 01:00:02.040
Hard agree on that one Notch. He then writes a thread seemingly going truth mode on society,

01:00:02.040 --> 01:00:05.720
you cannot negotiate with these people who are trying to destroy human civilization as we know

01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:09.560
it. At least that's what I take from the thread, though the last two tweets seemed more direct to

01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:13.560
the trans community, mentioning gender dysphoria and pronouns, including the claim that trans

01:00:13.560 --> 01:00:17.880
people are trying to make it illegal to use the wrong pronouns, even though actually it's them

01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:23.000
who have the pronouns wrong. This began to receive some serious pushback, especially from some of his

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:27.080
trans followers who are particularly enthusiastic about Minecraft, with one sharing a pro-trans

01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:31.640
message in a My Little Pony format stating that trans women are women. Notch didn't appreciate

01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:35.560
that, and quote tweeted the person stating that they were wrong, and although trans women were

01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:40.360
deserving of support as much as anyone else, that anyone advocating for this position was evil,

01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:46.040
and feeding into a dangerous mentally ill delusion, using his sister's body dysmorphia as an example.

01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:49.640
When further challenged on this, it seems he's more concerned about the authoritarian nature

01:00:49.640 --> 01:00:53.720
of many people to quote demand that they be addressed by specific pronouns. He stands his

01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:57.800
ground, states that it is illegal in many places already, and agree with another tweet that if they

01:00:57.800 --> 01:01:02.120
do this unquestionably they will also be walking back women's rights, seemingly adopting a more

01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:06.600
trans-exclusionary radical feminist standpoint. Now, I do not know the law in every country or

01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:10.920
region, but the fact that Notch did not seem to cite any sources or even anecdotal content made

01:01:10.920 --> 01:01:14.680
these claims rather hard to work with, and when being asked what this all was about he commented

01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:18.600
the Great Awakening, which is another event commonly referenced on QAnon where the greater

01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:22.120
population becomes aware of the truth, Notch seemed to be framing his tweets from the lens

01:01:22.120 --> 01:01:26.600
that he was punching up against an oppressive regime, but many people didn't seem to agree.

01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:29.800
Although it was true that certain industries were striving towards greater diversity,

01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:33.880
many didn't think it was really at the request of any specific demographic. It was more just a

01:01:33.880 --> 01:01:37.720
financially intelligent thing to do to give products greater appeal, as the number of people

01:01:37.720 --> 01:01:41.960
in certain groups outnumbered the people who were annoyed by these groups' existence. As someone who

01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:46.120
made a game whose whole existence can be defined by the individual, and as a person who emphasised

01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:50.280
that in the past, this shouldn't be new information to Notch, but he came to the conclusion that this

01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:55.240
time it was state mandated. However, in the end it just seemed like he was targeting a group of

01:01:55.240 --> 01:02:00.680
people, whereas misinformation could be making targets out of them. It seemed that as time passed,

01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:02.680
he was growing only more conspiratorial.

01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:13.720
Throughout most of March, Notch continued to back its position unapologetically, responding in an

01:02:13.720 --> 01:02:17.640
increasingly blasé manner to those who showed hostility to them, and if there was any doubt

01:02:17.640 --> 01:02:21.240
about it you could just look at his bio, which contained a link to the website where Q would

01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:25.640
regularly post. Safe to say, Notch was definitely testing the patience of those who didn't hold his

01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:30.600
beliefs and still associated with him, most notably Munkraft itself. The person's recent

01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:34.760
turn to conspiracy theories had almost locked him in a self-inflicted cycle. As he became more and

01:02:34.760 --> 01:02:38.760
more extreme, fewer and fewer people felt truly comfortable with his ideas, and consequently

01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:43.240
probably weren't as keen to entertain his presence. Notch observed this and embraced his alienation.

01:02:43.240 --> 01:02:47.320
He's been an outcast before, and he was ready to be an outcast again, likely attributing part of the

01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:50.840
reason to the fact that they couldn't handle him speaking the truth. Many of these people would

01:02:50.840 --> 01:02:55.240
probably be in on it as well. In 2019 though, after the string of tweets we've just covered,

01:02:55.240 --> 01:03:00.040
Microsoft began to decouple their casual, if still meaningful, relationship. It first began

01:03:00.040 --> 01:03:03.720
with the simple removal of references to him in the loading screen. This seemed to be rather

01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:08.120
insignificant on the surface, however up to this point it was extremely rare for any splash text

01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:13.000
to be erased, only happening a handful of times in Minecraft's lifespan. At the time, many suspected

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:17.240
this to be related to the incidents analysed in the previous part, however Microsoft refused to

01:03:17.240 --> 01:03:20.920
comment on the matter, and ultimately this was deemed rather trivial. However, there was another

01:03:20.920 --> 01:03:24.920
event round the corner that would test Microsoft's position on the matter, that being the 10th

01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:29.880
anniversary of Minecraft's publication to the internet. It made sense that Notch wasn't involved

01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:34.040
with the public image of Minecraft as it was, but at the end of the day, without him, Minecraft

01:03:34.040 --> 01:03:38.120
wouldn't exist, and the 10th anniversary was a celebration of just that. By not commenting on the

01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:41.880
removal of the splash text that credits him, Microsoft had the choice open so they wouldn't

01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:45.880
seem hypocritical if they did invite him, however barely a month after it seems they had made

01:03:45.880 --> 01:03:49.880
a decision that he would not be included in the landmark festival for all things Minecraft,

01:03:49.880 --> 01:03:53.800
with the spokesperson telling the press, his comments and opinions do not reflect those of

01:03:53.800 --> 01:03:58.440
Microsoft or Mojang and are not representative of Minecraft. Notch didn't seem to make any public

01:03:58.440 --> 01:04:02.840
comment himself, he moved on to playing the game Factorio, he seemed to be having fun with it at

01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:07.000
least. In the run up to the event he made a couple vague posts here and there which were hard to

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:11.240
interpret, but on the day of the anniversary he put out a single tweet reading, Happy Birthday,

01:04:11.880 --> 01:04:16.840
smiley face. It reached almost 30,000 likes, which is far more than any of his previous argumentative

01:04:16.840 --> 01:04:19.880
tweets had reached, and in these moments of wholesomeness you almost forget what he was

01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:24.280
tweeting barely a couple months before. In a way, Minecraft's decision was probably in the best

01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:28.040
interests of everyone, if Notch still held his beliefs pretty ardently at this point, I'm sure

01:04:28.040 --> 01:04:31.960
he probably saw his exclusion as a badge of honour above anything else. If you believe in that sort

01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:36.680
of satanic cabal, Microsoft is definitely a part of it, however I think Notch likely had a different

01:04:36.680 --> 01:04:40.600
viewpoint that could be illuminated by a few tweets. Although not commenting on his exclusion

01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:44.360
from the anniversary event, Notch did briefly comment on Microsoft removing the in-game

01:04:44.360 --> 01:04:48.680
references to him. After expressing regret for something assumedly relating to his position on

01:04:48.680 --> 01:04:53.000
trans people, he responds to a comment to someone saying that Minecraft removing references to him

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:57.560
may be a way to help him process what he had been saying and doing. This comment seems to demonstrate

01:04:57.560 --> 01:05:01.720
some contrition for his recent antics, and seemingly accepts his fate for whatever happens

01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:06.760
next. People had additionally started a movement to recognise Hatsune Miku as the creator of

01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:11.320
Minecraft, and Notch appeared to take it on the chin, stating that letting go is key. It's hard to

01:05:11.320 --> 01:05:15.720
retell where Notch stood on his comments, as he neither issued a formal retraction, or reassertion

01:05:15.720 --> 01:05:19.560
following them. He seemed to regret how he'd phrased it himself, and that he had hurt people,

01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:24.040
but didn't elaborate on whether he stood by his opinions. Regardless, he seemed to accept that

01:05:24.040 --> 01:05:29.080
where he was, and where Minecraft was, were not the same place, and for that much, he was right,

01:05:29.080 --> 01:05:33.400
they weren't. Over the following year, he mostly refrained from talking politics directly,

01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:37.320
the occasional comment about Trump or Hillary, but ones that were not too hard to read into.

01:05:37.320 --> 01:05:41.160
I honestly find a fair few of his tweets hard to completely understand sometimes, and his use of

01:05:41.160 --> 01:05:45.080
the word evil seems to have lost its meaning, to be honest. There was a hoax that he had passed away

01:05:45.080 --> 01:05:49.000
from a drug overdose, which was obviously not true, I think it once again likely arose from

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:53.240
someone who was probably not a fan, but it was quickly debunked given that Notch was still firing

01:05:53.240 --> 01:05:57.080
off tweets every other hour. Although it was safe to say that Notch had been less provocative than

01:05:57.080 --> 01:06:00.840
he had been, he was still quite loud with his opinions when he chose to be, he still gave off

01:06:00.840 --> 01:06:04.600
the energy of one of those people who says they're not being political, but they clearly

01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:10.120
are at points. In August of 2020, a YouTuber by the name of Game Maker's Toolkit decided to try

01:06:10.120 --> 01:06:13.880
and run some ads on their channel. They posted their conclusion on their twitter and referenced

01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:18.520
certain re-election ads from Mr Trump. Notch, seemingly displeased with this comment, requested

01:06:18.520 --> 01:06:23.720
them to drop the politics, which GMTK said they would if Notch in return deleted his twitter

01:06:23.720 --> 01:06:29.000
account. Surprisingly, the person decided to agree. GMTK took down their tweet, and Notch took

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:33.640
down his account, taking the world back to the blissful days before people cared about who their

01:06:33.640 --> 01:06:37.880
president was and that crap. Except a few days later Notch came back, explained that he was worried

01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:42.280
someone would claim his name tag so had to do it for security reasons, and at that point just felt

01:06:42.280 --> 01:06:46.840
he had to start tweeting anyway, which doesn't make much sense, but his return to twitter couldn't be

01:06:46.840 --> 01:06:51.400
a surprise. I think it's fair to observe the fact that although many tweets covered in the last

01:06:51.400 --> 01:06:55.480
couple parts obviously did generate controversy amongst communities, they didn't really attract

01:06:55.480 --> 01:06:59.640
too much attention from those outside the immediate sphere. A few articles and responses,

01:06:59.640 --> 01:07:04.200
but otherwise it was pretty quiet. You have to be an avid follower of the industry to notice.

01:07:04.200 --> 01:07:08.280
Notch never really farmed the attention that he was receiving, when most celebrities go rogue they

01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:12.520
at least take an interview slot on Tucker Carson or something. Notch never seemed to sacrifice his

01:07:12.520 --> 01:07:17.160
hatred of public life for publicity of his opinions, amongst many he was still that guy who

01:07:17.160 --> 01:07:21.160
made the game that their kids play, and they still heralded him from the era that had him as one of

01:07:21.160 --> 01:07:25.400
the most powerful people in the world. It's likely why Microsoft was so hesitant to drop him,

01:07:25.400 --> 01:07:29.480
but eventually they realised that their name attached to an article could yield a bit more

01:07:29.480 --> 01:07:34.760
cares, especially if Notch said something ill timed at the event, prospectively poisoning sales.

01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:38.920
Ultimately the benefits of hosting someone like Notch, who had no technical connection to Minecraft

01:07:38.920 --> 01:07:45.320
in its then present form, did not outweigh the drawbacks, and thus the disconnect was complete.

01:07:45.320 --> 01:07:46.520
But what was left behind?

01:07:50.760 --> 01:07:54.600
Now you're mostly up to date, the year is whatever it is right now, who bloody knows,

01:07:54.600 --> 01:07:59.640
and Notch has mostly faded into the ether, which given the current escalating political climate

01:07:59.640 --> 01:08:04.280
is probably for the best. As said, many do likely not know about all the antics over the previous

01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:08.440
years, some probably hate him for it, a few probably think he's based, but I wonder how he

01:08:08.440 --> 01:08:13.640
feels after all. The person who was previously so open about his feelings has become quite quiet,

01:08:13.640 --> 01:08:17.720
his twitter mostly observations now, with the occasional tweet of affection to those still

01:08:17.720 --> 01:08:22.440
there. You can't help but wonder when looking back at his career if he thinks it was all worth it.

01:08:22.440 --> 01:08:26.840
Person occupies this strange position of having so much, yet having so little. With a money and

01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:31.160
lack of commitment he really had to anyone or anything, he became this social media drifter,

01:08:31.160 --> 01:08:35.320
just kinda coasting from one topic to the next without any real continuity, free to speak his

01:08:35.320 --> 01:08:40.440
mind without proper material consequence, emphasis on material. Meanwhile though, the spoils of being

01:08:40.440 --> 01:08:44.680
a popular figure had dried up as soon as he'd ventured down the conspiratorial path. Although

01:08:44.680 --> 01:08:48.200
Microsoft were the only people to officially cut ties with him, there were likely many other

01:08:48.200 --> 01:08:52.360
opportunities that didn't present themselves due to these comments. Companies, conventions,

01:08:52.360 --> 01:08:56.200
associates would likely see him as a liability, and where some people might actually care about

01:08:56.200 --> 01:08:59.960
their reputation with Microsoft ending their association with him, Notch just seemed to

01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:04.200
accept that he had made his bet, but acceptance doesn't equate to happiness. I think a lot of

01:09:04.200 --> 01:09:08.600
people felt a sort of confusion as to what exactly led us to this scenario, and to be honest it is

01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:12.840
understandable. The first thing when analysing a person's behaviour is often to search for motive,

01:09:12.840 --> 01:09:17.240
to find some discernible cause, and a cursory look at Notch's background and existence wouldn't really

01:09:17.240 --> 01:09:20.360
point to anything that would lead to such behaviour, particularly given that most people

01:09:20.360 --> 01:09:24.920
knew him from Minecraft, and what it represented to them. Throughout much of his lifespan,

01:09:24.920 --> 01:09:29.080
Minecraft garnered a significant audience who didn't necessarily fit into traditional societal

01:09:29.080 --> 01:09:33.080
norms, and that wasn't necessarily a surprise given that the guy who created it also didn't

01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:36.920
when he was growing up. Loads of people played Minecraft, likely many with extremely diverse

01:09:36.920 --> 01:09:40.760
backgrounds and political views, and it never possessed a specific identity per se,

01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:44.760
but over the years it garnered a reputation as probably the most inclusive and accessible games

01:09:44.760 --> 01:09:48.440
of modern history. Probably a good example of this is how it benefited the social skills of

01:09:48.440 --> 01:09:52.520
many who have lacked them otherwise. Minecraft has been shown to really aid children who experience

01:09:52.520 --> 01:09:56.520
certain neurodevelopmental conditions such as autism, with many parents singing their praises

01:09:56.520 --> 01:10:00.600
of the game's transformative effect for their loved ones, finding a community and escape that

01:10:00.600 --> 01:10:04.680
actually helps them be more comfortable in their own skin. In the last few decades society has

01:10:04.680 --> 01:10:08.440
become increasingly aware and sensitive to those who encounter such conditions, and the social

01:10:08.440 --> 01:10:11.960
challenges that they may have to traverse as a result of it. While many regular social

01:10:11.960 --> 01:10:15.800
environments were still learning to evolve to the needs of those who may or may not thrive in those

01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:19.800
places, Minecraft was already there, and I don't think that was restricted to any specific

01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:23.960
demographic. I think it's also applied to many marginalised LGBT individuals, particularly those

01:10:23.960 --> 01:10:28.280
in the trans community who found solacing a game where your entire life is essentially customisable.

01:10:28.280 --> 01:10:31.960
It's not just an escape from the real world, it's the entrance to a completely different one.

01:10:31.960 --> 01:10:36.120
We discussed how a game can often represent its creator, and Minecraft represented a place that

01:10:36.120 --> 01:10:40.040
remedied people who experienced the often isolating life growing up that Notch did.

01:10:40.040 --> 01:10:44.040
That's a principle that doesn't end on the basis of personal identity, and therefore if anyone was

01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:47.960
going to understand the contemporary struggle of marginalised groups to fit in with society,

01:10:47.960 --> 01:10:51.720
it should have been him right? Even if you believe that there wasn't any relationship between the

01:10:51.720 --> 01:10:55.640
creator and his game, even if perhaps people projected too much of the game onto the creator,

01:10:55.640 --> 01:10:59.160
it wasn't like Notch was ever vocal about any views that would contradict this image.

01:10:59.160 --> 01:11:02.280
On the contrary, in fact, as I've already documented, the dude announced that every

01:11:02.280 --> 01:11:05.720
character is genderless, and even facetiously claimed that that made them all gay,

01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:10.120
thus owning the homophobes. He didn't seem to have much respect for traditional gamer toxicity,

01:11:10.120 --> 01:11:14.520
criticising tropes such as calling someone gay as weird attempts at insults, and said that although

01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:18.840
he hadn't been attracted to a man, he tried to keep an open mind, and he's pretty cuddly.

01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:22.680
After he was informed that a Kickstarter he'd promoted was started by someone who

01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:27.400
seemingly helped homophobic views, he expressed disappointment, and said people should be sane.

01:11:27.480 --> 01:11:31.240
At a time where video game companies often stayed out of debates surrounding political issues,

01:11:31.240 --> 01:11:35.720
Notch's opinions on issues affecting marginalised communities always felt authentic. These days,

01:11:35.720 --> 01:11:39.240
it's often hard to tell which companies are actually interested in advancing the rights

01:11:39.240 --> 01:11:42.840
of those they claim to care about, and those who are just playing to the crowd as they always have.

01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:46.680
You could probably say that disingenuous support is better than none at all, but sometimes you also

01:11:46.680 --> 01:11:50.200
want to know who's not going to throw your rights under the bus when it's no longer profitable to

01:11:50.200 --> 01:11:54.120
them. Notch seemed like that guy, people might claim he was just being politically correct back

01:11:54.120 --> 01:11:58.200
when he had an audience to commit to, but I'd say all evidence suggests otherwise. As a guy

01:11:58.200 --> 01:12:02.360
whose success wasn't concerned by PR or even dependent on the game's sales, Notch was free

01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:06.280
to take whatever positions that he wished to, and he did take many in a time where they weren't

01:12:06.280 --> 01:12:10.680
necessarily widespread. His views on issues like piracy and big tech were considered different

01:12:10.680 --> 01:12:14.760
for their time in that industry, particularly when it was out of step with big tech itself.

01:12:14.760 --> 01:12:18.520
He was the anti-establishment figure whose success inadvertently tore up the status quo.

01:12:18.520 --> 01:12:22.440
The establishment's position on such matters has always been to predominantly follow popular

01:12:22.440 --> 01:12:26.680
opinion or play to the largest present market. Notch was never like that, and his game didn't

01:12:26.680 --> 01:12:30.760
conform to those boundaries either which is what made it such a success. I'm sure for many people

01:12:30.760 --> 01:12:34.680
who didn't identify with the traditional brand of gamer, Minecraft was their introduction to

01:12:34.680 --> 01:12:38.680
video games as a whole. I think that's what made his outburst on the matter of transgender rights

01:12:38.680 --> 01:12:42.360
the breaking point for corporate relations. Despite the numerous concerning statements

01:12:42.360 --> 01:12:46.440
prior, Notch had created this game based on principles that he seemed to advocate for

01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:50.360
before brutally turning on. It's not out of the question for people to change their opinions that

01:12:50.360 --> 01:12:54.360
much is true, but this just didn't make sense with what he'd created before. I don't think

01:12:54.360 --> 01:12:57.880
anyone ever saw these tweets as a grift, he didn't have anything to gain from his actions,

01:12:57.880 --> 01:13:01.400
and didn't seem to want to gain anything from them. On the other hand, looking at the evidence,

01:13:01.400 --> 01:13:05.080
I don't think you can say he was being dishonest or corporate with his views before, I don't think

01:13:05.080 --> 01:13:09.960
selling his share in Minecraft necessarily freed his opinions anymore, but how can we reconcile

01:13:09.960 --> 01:13:14.520
two parts of an individual's life that seem so contradictory? Maybe we need to get into his shoes

01:13:14.520 --> 01:13:30.680
a little more. When analysing two apparently contradictory patterns of thoughtful behaviour,

01:13:30.680 --> 01:13:34.280
sometimes it's important to look at the wider picture and causes, and how they may have

01:13:34.280 --> 01:13:38.040
interacted with each other. With Notch, I think the clues to understanding his about-turn in

01:13:38.040 --> 01:13:42.120
political positions can be defined by a few constants and variables that impacted his

01:13:42.120 --> 01:13:45.800
previously rather innocent worldview. So let's talk about some of these factors.

01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:49.720
The most important factor is that of community. I think if there's one thing that matters to Notch,

01:13:49.720 --> 01:13:53.640
it's community. It's a complicated aspect of video game creation that he wrangled with for

01:13:53.640 --> 01:13:57.480
much of his career, but although he wasn't always a media darling, and often definitely took pride

01:13:57.480 --> 01:14:01.080
in having some sort of control in the direction of his projects, he definitely valued the input

01:14:01.080 --> 01:14:05.240
from those around him, particularly those who actually sampled his output. This began the

01:14:05.240 --> 01:14:09.160
community of indie developers, some of whom he would go on to work with in creating Minecraft.

01:14:09.160 --> 01:14:12.840
He would regularly post his projects and interact with other developments, providing feedback and

01:14:12.840 --> 01:14:17.160
accepting it for his own works. It's not a surprise that in spite of the game's traction outside the

01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:21.320
forums, the person remained active there on his account until the end of 2010, continuing to

01:14:21.320 --> 01:14:25.480
discuss Minecraft and general gaming matters with other budding developers. This was a similar

01:14:25.480 --> 01:14:28.840
pattern with his audience, although it was difficult to necessarily orchestrate a close

01:14:28.840 --> 01:14:33.080
relationship with your user base, Notch did his best, using a combination of Twitter and Tumblr

01:14:33.080 --> 01:14:37.240
to provide a balance between informal expressions of personal opinion and official announcements.

01:14:37.240 --> 01:14:41.240
He enjoyed attending conferences and interacting with fans, being a part of something so much

01:14:41.240 --> 01:14:46.040
greater gave him a sense of purpose. Person also reaped the benefits of a tight-knit workforce in

01:14:46.040 --> 01:14:49.960
the company that he founded, maintaining the total number of staff under 50 during his tenure at the

01:14:49.960 --> 01:14:54.440
business. Notch reportedly held a strong personal camaraderie with his employees. Mojang's office

01:14:54.440 --> 01:14:58.280
was based on the design of a regular home, and filled to the brim with amenities. Workers would

01:14:58.280 --> 01:15:02.520
be treated to lucrative bonuses, and company trips involving the entire workforce would be made to

01:15:02.520 --> 01:15:07.000
luxurious spots to celebrate the game's continued prosperity. Community mattered to Minecraft,

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:11.000
as a grassroots game with no investors, it was what kept the game untethered and unimpeded by

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:14.920
ulterior interests, and if it mattered to Minecraft, it mattered to Marcus. I think the

01:15:14.920 --> 01:15:19.080
enjoyment of community resulted from the fact that Notch assumed the role of a working-class

01:15:19.080 --> 01:15:22.840
hero of sorts, a lot of people from this sort of background could have easily let the spoils of

01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:26.600
stardust come to them, it almost had the opposite effect on Person, who seemed determined to

01:15:26.600 --> 01:15:31.720
demonstrate his allegiance to the everyday gamer. It should be no secret, Notch liked to be liked.

01:15:32.280 --> 01:15:35.960
I don't think this core set of beliefs ever deserted him, however as the circumstances

01:15:35.960 --> 01:15:40.520
surrounding his popularity evolved, his position and that of others influenced his perspectives

01:15:40.520 --> 01:15:45.160
on said communities. As his fanbase grew, his activity on the developer's forum quietened down,

01:15:45.160 --> 01:15:49.000
the increase in gulf between him and those who enjoyed the game also expanded. In spite of the

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:53.400
claims he was acting the user's best interests, the situation regarding in-game transactions

01:15:53.400 --> 01:15:57.480
ultimately broke him because people alleged he was prioritising corporate interests,

01:15:57.480 --> 01:16:01.080
something that clearly upset him so much that he decided to sell his shares.

01:16:01.080 --> 01:16:05.160
Think about it for a moment, one of the most successful figures in the video game industry

01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:09.640
sold the shares to his company because he was upset at what people online were saying.

01:16:09.640 --> 01:16:13.560
This may have solved one issue, but it opened up another after many of its staff seemed dissatisfied

01:16:13.560 --> 01:16:17.960
with the outcome of the deal. This was a guy who had turned down any and all investors up until

01:16:17.960 --> 01:16:21.960
this point, and although he did secure protections and bonuses for many of his employees, the

01:16:21.960 --> 01:16:26.360
principal of going with something he'd previously opposed, ferociously too seemed to hurt them.

01:16:26.360 --> 01:16:30.200
In many ways he gained a lot, but he'd lost what mattered to him for so long, and with the

01:16:30.200 --> 01:16:33.880
increased distance between him and the surrounding world, he gradually grew more listless and

01:16:33.880 --> 01:16:38.440
languid. Eventually he was left with no community, nobody to properly identify with, and it wasn't

01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:41.800
like the wealth was the inherent root of the problem, but it was the result of decisions

01:16:41.800 --> 01:16:45.720
that inevitably isolated him from a lot of people. He wanted to rid himself of the crippling

01:16:45.720 --> 01:16:50.120
responsibilities that had come with being part of these communities, but had nothing to fill it with

01:16:50.120 --> 01:16:53.480
until the internet began to move in a different direction, a more political one.

01:16:54.440 --> 01:16:56.520
Like that's ever gonna happen.

01:16:56.520 --> 01:17:00.680
Politics is something that many people understandably avoid, but it's also something that many people

01:17:00.680 --> 01:17:04.360
can be sucked into, particularly if they have nothing better to do than firing up the old blue

01:17:04.360 --> 01:17:08.200
bird and picking the first hot take that rubs others the wrong way. Not to have been outspoken

01:17:08.200 --> 01:17:12.120
on many of his political opinions, but never seem to attach too much meaning to it personally,

01:17:12.120 --> 01:17:17.240
but as a perpetually bored person looking for a cause to latch onto, what happened in 2016 was the

01:17:17.240 --> 01:17:21.080
perfect catalyst. The campaign and subsequent election of Donald Trump, and the reaction from

01:17:21.160 --> 01:17:25.080
mainstream sources to much of his behaviour sparked a backlash amongst many on the internet,

01:17:25.080 --> 01:17:29.240
not necessarily because people identified with him particularly, to be frank he wasn't very

01:17:29.240 --> 01:17:33.240
related, but because they saw him as a sort of symbol in an enduring culture war against people

01:17:33.240 --> 01:17:37.480
who wished to restrict online freedoms that had long been enjoyed by those who had used it.

01:17:37.480 --> 01:17:41.480
Trump hated the establishment, big tech, and many of the organisations that Notch had rallied

01:17:41.480 --> 01:17:45.560
against in the past, even though I'd say Trump had very different gripes to someone like Notch,

01:17:45.560 --> 01:17:49.880
as an influential person his cause was enough, and in a way it was the resistance that provoked

01:17:49.880 --> 01:18:11.160
people. It's also important to note that a lot of mainstream businesses that had long been

01:18:11.160 --> 01:18:15.080
apolitical in many ways became outspoken on certain social issues that Trump was thought

01:18:15.080 --> 01:18:19.080
to possibly hold power over, particularly given their increasing prominence on social media,

01:18:19.080 --> 01:18:22.680
and the new generation using it who were somewhat more progressive in their viewpoints.

01:18:22.680 --> 01:18:26.600
I think this sort of corporate movement probably alarmed someone like Notch, as to him they always

01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:31.320
seem like the bellwether of cynical self-serving opinions, and sometimes the enemy of your enemy

01:18:31.320 --> 01:18:35.800
is your friend. This is what started it at least, although he had mostly avoided taking positions

01:18:35.800 --> 01:18:40.040
in past controversies and even larger scale situations, something about defending internet

01:18:40.040 --> 01:18:44.360
culture seemed to galvanise him, as that guy who essentially had his career launched by the online

01:18:44.360 --> 01:18:48.680
world, he was obviously going to be defensive of his characteristics that enabled his success.

01:18:48.680 --> 01:18:53.080
After selling his shares he had lost his cause and community, but a new one was emerging,

01:18:53.080 --> 01:18:57.560
one where he was part of the last line against a culture that could sterilise everything that made

01:18:57.560 --> 01:19:03.000
it great. However, that still doesn't fully explain how we go from this, to this. There's

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:07.000
still a degree of disconnect, well, it wasn't a solo effort.

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:16.840
Intro

01:19:16.840 --> 01:19:21.000
To understand the final stage of Notch's rabbit hole of conspiratorial behaviour, you have to

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:25.240
understand the conspiracies behind it, and how they took their grasp on corners of the internet.

01:19:25.240 --> 01:19:29.880
The American political world was certainly being shaken up in 2016, and it's not hard to understand

01:19:29.880 --> 01:19:34.200
why. Many people have made the valid observation there was a huge gulf between those in government,

01:19:34.200 --> 01:19:38.120
the media, large corporations, and practically everyone else. Many Americans saw their lives

01:19:38.120 --> 01:19:42.280
going nowhere, and they wanted something that could give them a purpose. I already spoke about

01:19:42.280 --> 01:19:45.880
the connection between hating the establishment and loving someone like Trump, but the Forum of

01:19:45.880 --> 01:19:50.600
QAnon took that idea one step further, and vied this elaborate explanation for everything occurring,

01:19:50.600 --> 01:19:54.920
rooted in this idea that Donald Trump was the person to overhaul the broken system as we know it,

01:19:54.920 --> 01:19:59.800
and bring the power abusing elite to justice. It took off because it targeted a certain demographic

01:19:59.800 --> 01:20:04.040
of Americans who felt taken for granted by those in charge, it provided an explanation that played

01:20:04.040 --> 01:20:08.200
into that moral black and white sort of thinking, presented people with a clear villain, a hero,

01:20:08.200 --> 01:20:12.360
and a purpose to actually support. Person wasn't like many people part of this movement though,

01:20:12.360 --> 01:20:16.600
firstly he wasn't American, he spent a fair amount of time there, but if everything did go to the

01:20:16.600 --> 01:20:21.160
dogs he could easily just go back to his cushy residence in Stockholm. Person also wasn't someone

01:20:21.160 --> 01:20:25.080
who was disenfranchised at that point, he lived a life of relative privilege, of course it was

01:20:25.080 --> 01:20:29.160
roots from his own product, but it wasn't like he had anything to resent about his current lifestyle

01:20:29.160 --> 01:20:33.320
at its core. At some points in conversation he had mentioned the financial aspects of American

01:20:33.320 --> 01:20:37.160
politics which may lead some people to thinking he had ulterior motives, however he didn't have

01:20:37.160 --> 01:20:41.080
any business interest in grifting because he'd sold them all, and these opinions probably cost

01:20:41.080 --> 01:20:45.000
him a lot more in actual opportunities. Even many of those on the right avoided the realms

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:49.400
of QAnon because of how it was based mostly in speculation, for many people such a site was the

01:20:49.400 --> 01:20:53.320
most unattractive setting of ideas to subscribe to. There's little doubt that Notch's tweets were

01:20:53.320 --> 01:20:57.960
not designed to reap the words of those agreed with him, so what was it? First let's talk about

01:20:57.960 --> 01:21:01.560
the sense of purpose that appealed to someone like Notch, who had clearly been understimulated

01:21:01.560 --> 01:21:05.320
for too long by the world around him. We already knew that he had sympathies towards Trump in life

01:21:05.320 --> 01:21:09.320
the position he occupied in much of the media, and the culture war that was occurring online.

01:21:09.320 --> 01:21:13.480
QAnon elevated this idea of a culture war to fantastical levels, and made everyone who was

01:21:13.480 --> 01:21:17.640
a part of it feel like a soldier for a cause that underscored the fabric of society. To many

01:21:17.640 --> 01:21:22.040
outsiders it seemed so dangerously far-fetched, that's what made it exciting in the eyes of those

01:21:22.040 --> 01:21:26.040
who were actually there. It could easily be the plot to a dystopian video game where you're the

01:21:26.040 --> 01:21:30.120
resistance against a worldwide cannibalistic cabal. There are plenty of conspiracy theories

01:21:30.120 --> 01:21:34.520
online, but this one had a plot and a finale, one where everyone who stood with the people against

01:21:34.520 --> 01:21:39.000
the powers would be rewarded. Although it's just my perspective, I think Notch emotionally connected

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:43.560
with that, we're already aware of how seriously he took these issues. There is one more aspect

01:21:43.560 --> 01:21:46.920
about a lot of these radical causes that often brings people together though, and that is the

01:21:46.920 --> 01:21:51.000
absence of judgement between many people involved in these movements. Notch had clearly struggled to

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:55.080
find community after selling his share in Mojang, particularly given that he was a paranoid person

01:21:55.080 --> 01:21:59.000
and didn't trust many in his own life, especially now that there could be superficial motives to

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:02.760
befriending him. He seemed to genuinely believe that most of the high society that he was part of

01:22:02.760 --> 01:22:07.080
was corrupt and self-serving, sometimes seeming to long for more organic connections. I think the

01:22:07.080 --> 01:22:10.520
problem with the real world is that when you become such a well-known figure your reputation

01:22:10.520 --> 01:22:13.720
precedes you, and you don't get the chance to make first impressions because they've already

01:22:13.720 --> 01:22:18.520
been made through publicity and media. By existing in online, often anonymous spaces, Notch probably

01:22:18.520 --> 01:22:23.480
rediscovered a sense of community that transcended his existence outside of those real-world circles.

01:22:23.480 --> 01:22:27.320
Notch enjoyed the forums of 4chan because he believed that it was people at their most honest

01:22:27.320 --> 01:22:31.000
and unfiltered, but also a lot of what united people was just the fact that they could be

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:35.240
themselves. QAnon was more than that though, as a cause that provided an unquestioning community

01:22:35.240 --> 01:22:40.360
for all those who united under its banner, a real us versus them, something where who you were came

01:22:40.360 --> 01:22:45.080
secondary to everything else, and to hell to those who doubted you. For a lot of people this becomes

01:22:45.080 --> 01:22:49.320
a very damaging cycle though, because the more divisive a conspiracy theory, the more it might

01:22:49.320 --> 01:22:53.720
actually affect personal interactions. A lot of people believed if you followed QAnon then you

01:22:53.720 --> 01:22:57.080
were just too delusional to even have a conversation with, so you could be distanced

01:22:57.080 --> 01:23:01.240
from people completely and left with like-minded people who may not be the most beneficial to your

01:23:01.240 --> 01:23:06.360
well-being. The other problem is that QAnon possessed what I would call explicable dissonance,

01:23:06.360 --> 01:23:10.760
a concept common to a lot of conspiracy theories that provides an explanation for why outsiders

01:23:10.760 --> 01:23:15.080
may expound otherwise logical reputations of the core doctrine in question. These sorts of

01:23:15.080 --> 01:23:20.360
dismissals assign ignorance, brainwashing, and the very common idea that all will be revealed soon

01:23:20.360 --> 01:23:24.840
to discredit critiques of QAnon's proposed dogma. People have turned their nose up at it, but it's

01:23:24.840 --> 01:23:30.200
a powerful logical bind, albeit fallacious. QAnon did appeal to many disenfranchised people,

01:23:30.200 --> 01:23:33.880
but it also appealed to individuals who were starved of some form of purpose in life or

01:23:33.880 --> 01:23:38.520
community, things that every person really needs to feel emotionally fulfilled. A lot of old Q's

01:23:38.520 --> 01:23:42.360
predictions ended up not occurring, and at any point these could be signalled to bring the

01:23:42.360 --> 01:23:46.280
credibility of such a figure into question, but the truth was the cause was greater than

01:23:46.280 --> 01:23:51.160
even the verity of any individual claim. Ideology came before anything else, even sometimes the

01:23:51.160 --> 01:23:55.560
lives and well-being of those who were actually part of the movement, some would rather be a martyr

01:23:55.560 --> 01:23:59.880
for the cause. These communities also became very insular, when you surround yourself with people

01:23:59.880 --> 01:24:04.440
who only see things one way, you're very susceptible to succumbing to those perspectives, even if

01:24:04.440 --> 01:24:09.000
otherwise in a normal environment you would dismiss them. Although Notch did not express his support

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:13.480
for the movement until 2019, the fact that he was promoting Pizzagate theories barely a few months

01:24:13.480 --> 01:24:17.640
before QAnon was founded shows the sort of places that he was frequenting, but I think more

01:24:17.640 --> 01:24:22.360
indicative was how he went about it. In his tweets, Person didn't seem to have a clear thought process

01:24:22.360 --> 01:24:27.240
behind exactly why these things were legit, he regularly appeared to contradict himself and seemed

01:24:27.240 --> 01:24:32.120
panicked and confused, even manic to a degree. Notch always saw himself as a man of the people,

01:24:32.120 --> 01:24:36.440
a guy who was fighting against the establishment, and in a way QAnon presented itself as that too.

01:24:36.440 --> 01:24:40.680
That was the entry point, but once you're in you're introduced to a lot of new ideas that build onto

01:24:40.680 --> 01:24:43.640
each other, and eventually you're hooked on something greater than that and you're in a bubble

01:24:43.640 --> 01:24:47.640
where you won't even listen to anything else outside of it. It's a chain reaction to what those

01:24:47.640 --> 01:24:52.200
Florida tweets could easily be the result of, and in many cases was honestly one of the milder

01:24:52.200 --> 01:24:57.320
results. The moral gravitas placed onto QAnon theories makes that fantasy very very real for

01:24:57.320 --> 01:25:02.280
some people, and it has led to tragedy in multiple instances, with a subreddit even dedicated to

01:25:02.280 --> 01:25:06.760
people whose friends and family members have been drawn in by those beliefs, many accounts describing

01:25:06.760 --> 01:25:11.480
them as previously perfectly reasonable individuals. What many saw as a public outburst

01:25:11.480 --> 01:25:15.480
in Notch's tweets was something that had long been building up behind the scenes, a product of

01:25:15.480 --> 01:25:20.440
under-stimulation, wealth-induced paranoia, and existential emptiness, and ironically the desire

01:25:20.440 --> 01:25:23.880
to be on the right side of history. But what will history say about him now?

01:25:31.640 --> 01:25:35.400
At the start of the video, I invoked JK Rowling when talking about people who have become

01:25:35.400 --> 01:25:39.880
controversial through their social media presence, however the one thing I would say about JK Rowling

01:25:39.880 --> 01:25:44.920
is that she does have conviction with her beliefs, even if I believe they're wrong. For someone like

01:25:44.920 --> 01:25:53.080
Notch, I feel there's a more relevant and recent example. This is Kanye West, a rapper and producer

01:25:53.080 --> 01:25:57.480
whose music has been widely acclaimed for nearly two decades. His outspoken nature on political

01:25:57.480 --> 01:26:01.560
issues garnered him a reputation for sure, but one that still commanded a level of respect for

01:26:01.560 --> 01:26:05.320
its independence. However, that good faith offered to him has ultimately been put under

01:26:05.320 --> 01:26:09.000
great strain in the wake of a plethora of anti-Semitic comments that do not even seek

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:22.920
to disguise the dangerous connotations. Similarly with Notch, it was hard to work out exactly what

01:26:22.920 --> 01:26:27.160
motivated Ye's sudden spiral into such unabashed backing of extreme beliefs, to the point where

01:26:27.160 --> 01:26:31.000
some even question whether it was an intentional move to tank his career. Although I wouldn't go

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:35.160
that far, I would say that a life where you have an abundance of resources but a lack of healthy

01:26:35.160 --> 01:26:39.640
relationships can cause one to lash out in a way that antagonises those around you. There are many

01:26:39.640 --> 01:26:43.720
ways of doing this, but turning to extreme beliefs is definitely one of them. It's an appeal to make

01:26:43.720 --> 01:26:48.200
yourself as ugly as possible, challenge people to disown you, turn public opinion against you,

01:26:48.200 --> 01:26:53.080
to change that superficiality. Both Kanye and Notch subscribed to beliefs that advocated this idea

01:26:53.080 --> 01:26:56.760
that some elite class were fundamentally working against the interests of the people, and as

01:26:56.760 --> 01:27:00.680
individuals who believed they were on the side of the underdog, what might seem like public meltdowns

01:27:00.680 --> 01:27:05.400
to others seem like acts of personal and public resistance to them. It's a dangerous technique

01:27:05.400 --> 01:27:09.400
though because you could easily just convert people to extreme beliefs, but sometimes people

01:27:09.400 --> 01:27:13.080
don't think about that, especially when they feel like everything's already been said and done,

01:27:13.080 --> 01:27:17.720
you feel like there's nothing else worthwhile left. We spoke about legacy, how one wishes to

01:27:17.720 --> 01:27:22.200
be remembered after they're gone. It's a complicated conversation, because as much as the thought of

01:27:22.200 --> 01:27:26.760
being revered by some around you may be alluring, you don't really have the privilege of living that

01:27:26.760 --> 01:27:31.320
legacy. If you live your life for a legacy then you're not really doing it on your own terms,

01:27:31.320 --> 01:27:35.800
for an artist sometimes it's about pursuing a personal vision first, even if those around you

01:27:35.800 --> 01:27:40.440
don't necessarily approve. Notch's story isn't like that of many artists though, he's one of the

01:27:40.440 --> 01:27:45.400
few people who has actually seen his legacy play out while he was still alive. Even public figures

01:27:45.400 --> 01:27:49.080
who have been in broad in far more serious controversies seem to have some control over

01:27:49.080 --> 01:27:53.560
the direction of their image, yet to many the conclusion for someone like Marcus Person had

01:27:53.560 --> 01:27:57.320
already been written when he moved on from Minecraft. I'd argue there are many who still

01:27:57.320 --> 01:28:01.160
probably have their thoughts dictated on the guy more from their opinion of his most famous

01:28:01.160 --> 01:28:05.320
video game above anything else, despite the fact that he hasn't worked on it for a decade.

01:28:05.320 --> 01:28:09.400
I think Notch was quietly aware of this, when being asked about his legacy he seemed to show

01:28:09.400 --> 01:28:13.320
disregard for the idea, and although I'm not entirely sure I buy his dismissive attitude,

01:28:13.320 --> 01:28:17.320
we'll get to that in a bit, I think he had to emotionally disconnect from it to an extent,

01:28:17.320 --> 01:28:21.480
or else he would have been a relic in his own mind. There was no way to properly follow up a

01:28:21.480 --> 01:28:26.360
game like Minecraft, a game so built on grassroots appeal, by the time that Notch acquired wealth and

01:28:26.360 --> 01:28:31.000
fame he could never naturally replicate something so organic unless he created a whole new anonymous

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:35.640
persona, crafting a magnum opus of such a scale at such a young age with nothing else publicly

01:28:35.640 --> 01:28:40.520
notable under his belt, becoming a personality so intertwined with that work, when he walked away it

01:28:40.520 --> 01:28:45.480
was a death of some sorts. The nature of what he did, essentially opting out of his career with

01:28:45.480 --> 01:28:49.400
such final effect, giving him no commitment to anything and a massive paycheck that allowed him

01:28:49.400 --> 01:28:53.480
to switch his life to sandbox mode. If life was a video game then Notch reached the end credits

01:28:53.480 --> 01:28:54.920
before he even turned 40.

01:28:54.920 --> 01:28:59.480
Notch- Right now I'm just, you know, buying houses in LA and partying.

01:28:59.480 --> 01:29:03.160
But the thing about the sandbox is that it does grow tiresome, having everything at the tip of

01:29:03.160 --> 01:29:06.920
your fingers can often do more harm than good, particularly when you're not a person who ever

01:29:06.920 --> 01:29:11.480
really had a strong connection to the reward of the process. Notch wanted to fulfil this idea of

01:29:11.480 --> 01:29:15.720
being a rich person, the next stage of his life, the way he spoke about it sometimes made it seem

01:29:15.800 --> 01:29:20.200
like its own occupation, but the truth is that it's not a job, and the only perceptual upsides

01:29:20.200 --> 01:29:24.360
of becoming a socialite was the public attention, something that person was vocal about not

01:29:24.360 --> 01:29:29.560
necessarily enjoying. He wanted to be a part of something, but not the centre of it. In the end,

01:29:29.560 --> 01:29:33.560
his prosperity merely made him even more distant and bitter than his work already left him,

01:29:33.560 --> 01:29:37.400
occasionally externalising that angst online, and in spite of some people offering their support

01:29:37.400 --> 01:29:41.720
or assistance, Big Snoop even offering a trip to the doggy den, eventually the new lifestyle

01:29:41.720 --> 01:29:46.200
wore out its welcome. Notch was an individual who cared about that community and that vision,

01:29:46.200 --> 01:29:50.760
but by the time the next cause to commit to came around, all he had was a fucked-up cache and some

01:29:50.760 --> 01:29:55.160
social media presence. That sandbox began to transform into a straightjacket, a naturally

01:29:55.160 --> 01:29:59.240
paranoid and unsettled person, he seemed to find new purpose in being outspoken and politically

01:29:59.240 --> 01:30:03.000
inclined, but gradually it grew into a set of beliefs much more antithetical to the world he

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:07.720
had previously created, who knows how long it was ultimately brewing. His tweets were a momentous

01:30:07.720 --> 01:30:12.200
climax in their own regard, but almost as soon as he expounded the theories that drew the greatest

01:30:12.200 --> 01:30:17.160
response he dropped them, never really addressing it, just kind of moving on. As is with the idea

01:30:17.160 --> 01:30:21.560
with sacrificing your own public image, maybe Notch got what he wanted, the detachment from

01:30:21.560 --> 01:30:25.560
the fear that his relationships were transactional, the ones who'll stick around in that scenario are

01:30:25.560 --> 01:30:29.800
the ones who genuinely care about your well being. Unlike Kanye, he didn't seem to make any new

01:30:29.800 --> 01:30:33.800
friends from his outburst nor did he end up on the Alex Jones show, but it still wasn't without

01:30:33.880 --> 01:30:38.680
its bruising. Ultimately, it's not really rid him of the title of the creator of Minecraft,

01:30:38.680 --> 01:30:43.080
just the title of the creator of Minecraft who then became a conspiracy theorist and racist,

01:30:43.080 --> 01:30:47.560
and a fair few other isths. Although I'm sure he sleeps okay on whatever mattress a couple billion

01:30:47.560 --> 01:30:52.200
can allow you to afford, there's still a lingering sadness that the outcome of years of hard work

01:30:52.200 --> 01:30:57.080
was a name that many would rather forget, but still struggle to, and the bittersweet connotations

01:30:57.080 --> 01:31:02.520
that come with the mention of it. He became a man both known for his best and worst moments,

01:31:02.520 --> 01:31:07.160
and neither seemed to cancel each other out in people's minds. So what now?

01:31:15.080 --> 01:31:18.920
I said Notch's Twitter has been pretty inoffensive over the past couple years,

01:31:18.920 --> 01:31:23.720
which is largely true, but recently the original composer for the Minecraft soundtrack C418 decided

01:31:23.720 --> 01:31:28.840
to put out a tweet expressing support for BLM and trans people, in light of a perceived rise in hate

01:31:28.840 --> 01:31:34.280
speech. Notch in return decides to sarcastically reply, there we go, that should fix it, not

01:31:34.280 --> 01:31:39.000
actively opposing the statement, but more snidely highlighting the futility of such a sentiment.

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:43.160
And maybe he's not wrong, maybe a tweet won't largely make a difference, but you'd think that

01:31:43.160 --> 01:31:47.640
the creator of Minecraft would be the first person to understand that great oaks can grow from small

01:31:47.640 --> 01:31:52.120
acorns, and even if only one person's life is changed for the better from it, it's still better

01:31:52.120 --> 01:31:56.600
than no change at all. Unfortunately though, I think it reflects the rather nihilistic worldview

01:31:56.600 --> 01:32:01.320
that Notch has adopted in the past few years, one that didn't seem present before. I probably

01:32:01.320 --> 01:32:05.320
understand more than most that it's easy to catch yourself in that train of thought, but for a man

01:32:05.320 --> 01:32:09.480
who's always seemed concerned about how to change people's lives for the better, he doesn't seem to

01:32:09.480 --> 01:32:14.920
know what's best for himself. If he did, I doubt we'd be here discussing it today. Notch's behaviour

01:32:14.920 --> 01:32:18.840
post Minecraft has definitely promoted a strange relationship for many people with the game,

01:32:18.840 --> 01:32:22.760
and bringing his name up in conversation to those passionate about the game, there's not a sense of

01:32:22.840 --> 01:32:27.160
great anger, but more just frustration and disappointment. Like with other celebrities,

01:32:27.160 --> 01:32:30.680
it's caused people to look back at creative decisions and question whether the science

01:32:30.680 --> 01:32:35.080
were always there, whether they can truly enjoy a game anymore in the context of what he said,

01:32:35.080 --> 01:32:39.320
what if they're just supporting a game with dangerous stereotypes and connotations themselves?

01:32:39.320 --> 01:32:43.640
It's hard to deal with the implications of speech, and you can't blame people for feeling conflicted

01:32:43.640 --> 01:32:47.160
about a game that they may have previously held very close to them throughout most of their life.

01:32:47.720 --> 01:32:51.960
As he sold his shares, possessing or buying Minecraft doesn't really help him directly,

01:32:51.960 --> 01:32:56.040
but even if they removed his credits, it'll always be his framework, and it's understandable

01:32:56.040 --> 01:33:01.160
if that makes people feel a bit ambivalent. What happened to that guy that so many knew and loved?

01:33:01.160 --> 01:33:05.080
I don't think the Marcus person that people thought they knew ever disappeared, nor do I

01:33:05.080 --> 01:33:09.320
think that he was an inherently hateful person, but I think over the years he definitely became

01:33:09.320 --> 01:33:13.080
a more challenging and troubled figure. He was never equipped to be a big time figurehead,

01:33:13.080 --> 01:33:16.680
he yearned for close interpersonal bonds, the simple pleasures of a creative's life,

01:33:16.680 --> 01:33:20.520
and he thought that cashing out his shares would allow him to get back to some form of normalcy,

01:33:20.520 --> 01:33:24.760
but to put it as concisely as possible, his position opened up a lot of old wounds and

01:33:24.760 --> 01:33:28.440
vulnerabilities that led him down a very dangerous path, and only seemed to halt when

01:33:28.440 --> 01:33:33.240
he revealed how far he was down there. It traded one form of status for another, possibly worse,

01:33:33.240 --> 01:33:37.400
form of status. He could've settled down to a long life of video game panels, Ted Talks,

01:33:37.400 --> 01:33:41.480
and meet and greets, become a visiting professor at a state university, or just gradually work on

01:33:41.480 --> 01:33:46.040
maintaining strong social bonds that would keep him from losing his mind. Instead, his handprints

01:33:46.040 --> 01:33:50.200
on a game have mostly been erased, his mention provokes uncertain groans, and some people would

01:33:50.440 --> 01:33:54.520
credit a fictional figure for the creation of one of the most universal experiences in recent

01:33:54.520 --> 01:33:58.360
history. He always seemed to have set this, but over the years has continued to name drop

01:33:58.360 --> 01:34:02.840
his magnum opus in many tweets, still reflecting on that era of his life, maybe only beginning to

01:34:02.840 --> 01:34:07.560
appreciate some of it properly now, it feels like he's still not over it. Whether all his previous

01:34:07.560 --> 01:34:11.960
actions were attempts to move past it is something only he knows, but when so much of your life is

01:34:11.960 --> 01:34:16.760
still tied to one game and its legacy, it's hard to create a new one. I think back to one quote I

01:34:16.760 --> 01:34:21.160
read in his blog post that if he ever accidentally ends up creating anything that might garner

01:34:21.160 --> 01:34:25.000
attention, he'll just scrap it immediately. Notch never seemed to find a position in life

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:29.160
where he was truly comfortable. I think it came down to three things, resources, time,

01:34:29.160 --> 01:34:33.880
and purpose. When he started his work he had time and purpose, but a lack of resources. As the game

01:34:33.880 --> 01:34:39.080
took off he had resources and purpose, but no time, and after he sold his shares he had resources

01:34:39.080 --> 01:34:43.720
and time, but no purpose, and his fear of ever gracing the spotlight again has often left him

01:34:43.720 --> 01:34:48.360
in that limbo. In the time that he was in the public spotlight it was hard to pinpoint a moment

01:34:48.360 --> 01:34:52.360
where Notch was ever comfortable with his life, and that eternal restlessness is something that

01:34:52.360 --> 01:34:57.000
can really corrupt the mind. I think it put him in a spot where he consigned himself to a stasis

01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:00.760
that he didn't want to live with. He loved programming but didn't enjoy the human aspects

01:35:00.760 --> 01:35:04.440
of success, but didn't want to be defined by one thing, but didn't know how to escape that

01:35:04.440 --> 01:35:08.760
definition. His love of community and desire to please people was replaced with this distrust

01:35:08.760 --> 01:35:13.800
and resentment towards all those around him, and eventually manifested in more and more destructive

01:35:13.800 --> 01:35:18.360
ways, leaving me to wonder if he could really rebuild his public image after it all.

01:35:18.360 --> 01:35:22.680
One of Notch's resolutions this year was to create a new game, him making wry commentary

01:35:22.680 --> 01:35:26.760
on his own commitment to do that. It still doesn't feel like he entirely knows what he wants.

01:35:26.760 --> 01:35:30.760
Minecraft was one of the most stressful areas of his life, it's understandable that he doesn't want

01:35:30.760 --> 01:35:35.400
to relive that, but sometimes you wonder if he still craves a bit of the taste. He's at a

01:35:35.400 --> 01:35:39.560
different stage of his life now, and so is Minecraft, to the point where you wonder if they

01:35:39.560 --> 01:35:44.600
even recognise each other. People draw parallels still, and wonder how the two grew so far apart.

01:35:44.600 --> 01:35:48.200
However, amongst the politics, the business interests, the billions of dollars, the social

01:35:48.200 --> 01:35:53.080
media meltdowns, the far right conspiracy theories, they still came from the same place.

01:35:53.080 --> 01:35:57.160
That was existent before any individual or business could dip their fingers in the pie,

01:35:57.160 --> 01:36:01.480
and although a person's evolving ideas can retroactively impact their art, the truth is that

01:36:01.480 --> 01:36:06.200
the place that Minecraft came from could never be represented by any tweet, and the game will always

01:36:06.200 --> 01:36:11.160
transcend whatever people put on social media accounts. We talk about art, but Minecraft isn't

01:36:11.160 --> 01:36:15.960
just a painting, it's the whole damn gallery, and so many people would create such great work

01:36:15.960 --> 01:36:20.760
on that canvas for years, decades, and maybe even centuries to come. So when Microsoft says

01:36:20.760 --> 01:36:25.000
that Notch doesn't really represent Minecraft's values, I don't think they're entirely wrong,

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:29.720
but it was still a part of him. Minecraft is greater than any single person, even Notch

01:36:29.720 --> 01:36:34.920
himself, but maybe Notch needs to be greater than Minecraft. As most avid Minecraft players

01:36:34.920 --> 01:36:39.160
will probably know, upon completion of Minecraft Survival Mode, you reach the end credits of the

01:36:39.160 --> 01:36:44.120
game, accompanied by a verse composition known as the End Poem. It lasts just shy of 9 minutes,

01:36:44.120 --> 01:36:47.880
and takes the structure of a conversation between two beings that present themselves as all that

01:36:47.880 --> 01:36:52.680
isn't the player, essentially the universe. It analyses many themes that Minecraft represents,

01:36:52.680 --> 01:36:57.240
but appears to conclude that the player themselves is the answer to all the questions they may have.

01:36:57.320 --> 01:37:00.440
You control your own destiny, you control your own fates.

01:37:00.440 --> 01:37:04.760
At the end of 2022, the author of the poem wrote a post on the blogging site Substack,

01:37:04.760 --> 01:37:08.040
explaining that he had made the decision to place the poem in the public domain as he had

01:37:08.040 --> 01:37:12.040
not contractually handed over his rights to Microsoft or Mojang. However, it's the reason

01:37:12.040 --> 01:37:16.120
behind this, and the story that inspired it, that is far more interesting. As Gough explained,

01:37:16.120 --> 01:37:20.920
he was hired in 2012 by Person to work on the final text, and quickly struck up a camaraderie

01:37:20.920 --> 01:37:25.800
with our Minecraft lead. However, when involving Karl Manet, the business' CEO, things quickly

01:37:25.800 --> 01:37:30.360
turned sour as they attempted to enter business negotiations. In the end, all Gough saw from his

01:37:30.360 --> 01:37:34.920
contributions was a single $20,000 check. The contract itself was a pretty standard but

01:37:34.920 --> 01:37:39.320
stringent hand over all exclusive rights to Mojang, including an NDA which would've obviously

01:37:39.320 --> 01:37:43.880
prevented Gough from even mentioning this agreement at all. However, that wasn't the kicker.

01:37:43.880 --> 01:37:48.760
Now that came in 2014, when Gough received an email from Karl following up on the agreement,

01:37:48.760 --> 01:37:53.720
requesting the signature once more. Gough explains that Manet had framed this as housekeeping,

01:37:53.720 --> 01:37:57.400
when in reality research showed this was just around the time the shareholders were looking

01:37:57.400 --> 01:38:03.160
to cash out, and were merely tying up some loose ends. With the buyout estimated to be $2.5 billion,

01:38:03.160 --> 01:38:07.480
Gough felt a bit deceived and shortchanged, especially with how he had been treated up to

01:38:07.480 --> 01:38:11.240
that point. He felt disrespected by people he considered friends, and although he ultimately

01:38:11.240 --> 01:38:15.400
didn't sign the contract, it still offended him. In spite of this and the heated exchange that

01:38:15.400 --> 01:38:19.640
followed, he didn't seek legal counsel, he didn't formally request his poem be removed from the game

01:38:19.640 --> 01:38:24.440
despite the furor it could've caused, he merely let it be. He ultimately did nothing, and gained

01:38:24.440 --> 01:38:28.760
nothing from it, and at first he felt bitter and resentful, but since states he has found peace.

01:38:28.760 --> 01:38:32.600
As a matter of fact, he argues that it was an important learning curve, and although he could've

01:38:32.600 --> 01:38:36.600
pursued it a bit more aggressively and ended up financially better off, he seems thankful he

01:38:36.600 --> 01:38:41.320
wasn't, as he probably learned more from losing out. However, he can't properly move on until

01:38:41.320 --> 01:38:45.480
he addresses the outstanding issue surrounding the copyright, not wishing to grant Microsoft

01:38:45.480 --> 01:38:49.560
the exclusive rights but also not wishing to remove it from the game. He ultimately relinquishes

01:38:49.560 --> 01:38:53.720
it to the public domain, and tells people to do whatever the hell they want with it. He was giving

01:38:53.720 --> 01:38:58.520
his work back to the world and drawing a line under it. Originally I wrote a paragraph here

01:38:58.520 --> 01:39:02.600
explaining why I included this anecdote, but I think I'm going to let it speak for itself.

01:39:02.600 --> 01:39:07.000
All I'll say is that, as written at the end, you are the answer to your own questions, it's never

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:11.560
too late to add some chapters to your story and give people a more satisfying conclusion, you just

01:39:11.560 --> 01:39:15.560
need to turn the page. Maybe Notch needs to be greater than Minecraft.

01:39:19.880 --> 01:39:24.840
Yep, so there we have it, that's the video. Hard one to end honestly, it's really hard to think of a

01:39:24.840 --> 01:39:29.800
way to wrap it up, but hopefully I have given you some food for thought at least, and maybe something

01:39:29.800 --> 01:39:35.640
to provoke discussion. I'd really like to thank my editors, they've once again done an outstanding

01:39:35.640 --> 01:39:40.040
job, I'm forever grateful for their contribution, it means a lot to me guys, and be sure to check

01:39:40.040 --> 01:39:43.880
them out if you have the time, their credits are all in the pinned comment below. I'd also like to

01:39:43.880 --> 01:39:50.040
give a thanks to my patrons, $10 patrons on screen now, or $10 plus at least, thank you very much guys,

01:39:50.040 --> 01:39:56.600
really appreciate it, and more personal shout out to my $50 patrons, Hypercube, Esther Bedoya,

01:39:56.600 --> 01:40:01.880
Laura Woodward, and Seri Tisch, thank you so much, your support genuinely means a lot. I'd also like

01:40:01.880 --> 01:40:07.160
to thank the thumbnail creator, Starfo, he does great work, great work as always, and the post

01:40:07.240 --> 01:40:12.920
editors, Scam, and Grumpy, two fantastically industrious people who did not stop at anything

01:40:12.920 --> 01:40:18.760
to get the job done. I'd also like to thank my sponsor, Aura, it was a pleasure working with you,

01:40:18.760 --> 01:40:24.040
they've been very very good to me, and hopefully if you enjoy using their app they can be good to

01:40:24.040 --> 01:40:28.680
you as well. Otherwise, I hope you guys are doing well, and I hope you took something away from this

01:40:28.680 --> 01:40:32.760
at least, this little ramble, and be sure to take care of yourselves. I don't really have too much

01:40:32.760 --> 01:40:37.480
else to add, so I'm The Right Opinion, and I will see you in the next one.
