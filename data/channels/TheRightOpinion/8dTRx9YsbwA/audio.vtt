00:00.000 --> 00:05.560
Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, there was a family.

00:05.560 --> 00:08.920
"- I got you a banana too!

00:08.920 --> 00:11.600
Okay, I don't want to do this."

00:11.600 --> 00:16.620
But this wasn't just any family, this was a vlogging family.

00:16.620 --> 00:20.220
"- Good morning, guys. Today, we're going to do a day in the life weekend style."

00:20.220 --> 00:24.520
At the center of the household, a loving mother by the name of Micah.

00:24.520 --> 00:29.580
"- It's going to be perfectly clean. I want it to smell like baked goods with flowers and candles lit.

00:29.580 --> 00:32.080
I just want it to be like the perfect hot fall evening."

00:32.080 --> 00:34.080
Micah Stauffer.

00:34.080 --> 00:36.580
She was the loving mother of five children.

00:36.580 --> 00:40.580
Jacob, Kova, Bradley, and Onyx.

00:40.580 --> 00:42.580
Hang on a minute.

00:42.580 --> 00:45.580
One, two, three.

00:45.580 --> 00:47.580
I only named four.

00:47.580 --> 00:52.580
"- Yeah. Oh, baby.

00:52.580 --> 00:55.580
I love you so much. You're my buddy."

00:55.580 --> 00:58.080
Ah, that's right.

00:58.080 --> 01:00.580
We don't do the happily ever afters here.

01:00.580 --> 01:04.080
Hello, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion.

01:09.680 --> 01:14.880
Family. For better and for worse, there is no connection like the one you create with the family.

01:14.880 --> 01:16.680
I've discussed this time and time again,

01:16.680 --> 01:20.780
so I shan't go into too much depth on my philosophical thoughts on one's kin's folk.

01:20.780 --> 01:25.280
But as you're aware by this point, emotional potential breeds market potential,

01:25.280 --> 01:29.280
and the family channel took its place on the YouTube terrain a long time ago.

01:29.280 --> 01:32.180
Now, family channels are no stranger to criticism.

01:32.180 --> 01:37.880
The extent that some families will go for views often places some of the channels at odds with the rather rigorous standards

01:37.880 --> 01:40.580
that audience members impose on such creators.

01:40.580 --> 01:42.080
Why do these standards exist?

01:42.080 --> 01:43.580
Well, because of the children.

01:43.580 --> 01:50.080
If you are a parent, many would assert that you have a responsibility to preserve as idyllic a childhood as possible for your offspring,

01:50.080 --> 01:56.480
and that degree of responsibility is only amplified when you are uploading content of your family onto a public platform.

01:56.480 --> 02:01.480
In spite of this, most criticism is typically confined to parents failing to be adequate role models,

02:01.480 --> 02:05.880
not just for their own family, but for others who they are supposed to be educating through their content.

02:05.880 --> 02:11.380
Some of these escapades may lead to others asking if these families are equipped properly to even have children.

02:11.380 --> 02:17.280
However, it is certainly parents who are asking that question themselves or even acting on such an inclination.

02:17.280 --> 02:20.280
This is where today's subjects appear to be an exception.

02:25.980 --> 02:29.280
As the introduction preface, this is Micah Stauffer.

02:29.280 --> 02:33.680
She's a family vlogger who has been sharing her life with us since 2014.

02:33.680 --> 02:38.180
Her husband, James, is a mechanical engineer and runs the channel Stauffer Garage,

02:38.180 --> 02:42.580
where he shares some of the work he does and occasionally reacts to poorly looked after vehicles.

02:42.580 --> 02:45.280
So it appears that such talent runs in the family.

02:45.280 --> 02:48.780
They were wedged shortly after the launch of the channel in July 2014,

02:48.780 --> 02:51.980
revealing their heartwarming success story in the same month.

03:09.780 --> 03:13.980
Micah's oldest child, Kova, was born in 2011 to a different partner.

03:13.980 --> 03:17.280
She was brought forward onto the vlog channel as the resident toddler,

03:17.280 --> 03:22.680
and over the following years, Micah built a family alongside her YouTube channel, sharing each step of the way.

03:22.680 --> 03:28.380
Two more children were born in this time, Jayka and Radley, with each pregnancy being documented fairly extensively.

03:28.380 --> 03:33.480
13 weeks, 14 weeks, 15 weeks, 16 weeks, 17 weeks, you get what I'm saying.

03:33.480 --> 03:37.980
She'd also promote postnatal well-being, in particular weight loss, a lot of weight loss.

03:37.980 --> 03:41.280
In fact, Micah was proud of her lean physique, self-care,

03:41.280 --> 03:44.680
and wanted to impart that wisdom upon all of her loyal followers.

03:44.680 --> 03:49.480
I don't just want to have a healthy body and not a healthy mind or a clear headspace.

03:49.480 --> 03:53.180
I want to stay positive. I want to be encouraging. I want to be uplifting to you.

03:53.180 --> 03:58.580
Like, that's the reason I started my YouTube channel, is to be a positive space and be an uplifting space

03:58.580 --> 04:02.880
for you to come and get inspired when you're feeling like you're struggling or you're down.

04:02.880 --> 04:07.180
Over time, she gradually cultivated an audience who were engaged in her day-to-day life.

04:07.180 --> 04:10.780
Her views tended to fluctuate a little, but her subscriber base was advancing,

04:10.780 --> 04:13.180
and she appeared satisfied with what she had created.

04:13.180 --> 04:16.380
After all, she was just a small piece of this family puzzle.

04:16.380 --> 04:18.380
I think that's what drew in certain viewers.

04:18.380 --> 04:22.380
Micah had found Elaine, and even though I personally found it a tad repetitive,

04:22.380 --> 04:24.680
rhythm and routine is comforting for many people.

04:24.680 --> 04:26.780
In many ways, Micah did everything right.

04:26.780 --> 04:31.480
She'd married an eligible bachelor, delivered children who were being raised in a supportive climate,

04:31.480 --> 04:34.780
and maintained her own well-being while helping others do the same.

04:34.780 --> 04:37.680
She was really living the American dream.

04:37.680 --> 04:39.180
But was that enough?

04:39.180 --> 04:41.080
Hi guys, and welcome back to my channel.

04:41.080 --> 04:44.880
Today I'm going to be sharing with you 15 baby names that I absolutely love,

04:44.880 --> 04:46.880
and one baby name that I'm going to be using.

04:46.880 --> 04:51.480
You see, in spite of her accustomed comfort zone, Micah always had a wild side,

04:51.480 --> 04:55.380
an edge to her, which may not necessarily correlate with the rest of her image.

04:55.380 --> 04:59.380
She aspired for something more in her role as a mother, and perhaps as a creator,

04:59.380 --> 05:05.180
and she couldn't just direct all that energy into quirky names like Camden, Remington,

05:05.180 --> 05:07.780
Niega, and Abecorn.

05:07.780 --> 05:09.480
Yes, Abecorn.

05:09.480 --> 05:10.580
No judgment, of course.

05:10.580 --> 05:14.380
If there are any Abecorns in the comments, be sure to make your presence known.

05:14.380 --> 05:16.080
I'm not invalidating you.

05:16.080 --> 05:18.780
However, there was one name that stood out from the rest.

05:18.780 --> 05:22.480
For the 12th name that I really like is Huxley.

05:22.480 --> 05:25.280
I think this is a really edgy, super modern name.

05:25.280 --> 05:30.280
Yes, Micah was a super modern renegade who had a vision for what her family could be.

05:30.280 --> 05:34.980
And after three children, she was ready to venture from the security of a suburban white bread world.

05:34.980 --> 05:41.180
And on the 6th of July 2016, our Mrs. Stauffer made the announcement that would change her life forever.

05:41.180 --> 05:43.180
Hi guys, and welcome back to my channel.

05:43.180 --> 05:48.480
Today, Jim and I have a very big surprise and secret that we want to share with you guys.

05:48.480 --> 05:51.680
But maybe Dorothy should have stayed in Kansas.

05:51.680 --> 05:56.180
You'll have to find out after we've spoken about rage.

05:56.180 --> 05:58.180
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

05:58.180 --> 05:59.680
Excuse me, I would like to finish the ad, please.

05:59.680 --> 06:00.980
They're not paying me this time.

06:00.980 --> 06:02.480
The people deserve to know.

06:02.480 --> 06:04.280
Oh, Jesus Christ, out!

06:04.280 --> 06:06.480
It's about my sheer love for the game.

06:06.480 --> 06:07.880
Out, go, leave.

06:07.880 --> 06:09.280
Okay, okay, I'll go.

06:11.280 --> 06:12.780
Tro, where's the door handle?

06:12.780 --> 06:13.280
Wait.

06:24.780 --> 06:27.280
Come on, Tro, you haven't fed us in two days.

06:27.280 --> 06:28.780
I don't see what the fuss is about.

06:28.780 --> 06:31.480
The answers haven't eaten in weeks and they've never been better.

06:34.280 --> 06:35.780
Please just just let us go.

06:35.780 --> 06:36.980
We'll do anything.

06:36.980 --> 06:38.180
Anything, eh?

06:38.180 --> 06:40.480
Well, I suppose I can offer you a way out.

06:40.480 --> 06:41.880
What? Tell us!

06:41.880 --> 06:45.680
All you have to do is listen to this one message.

06:45.680 --> 06:50.580
Raycons are the new hottest thing for your ear since I dropped my latest mixtape,

06:50.580 --> 06:52.680
Hot Wraps and Top Hats.

06:52.680 --> 06:56.980
It was founded by Ray J, our upstanding citizen of the century,

06:56.980 --> 07:00.580
who has also dabbled in hip hop, though not quite to my ability.

07:00.580 --> 07:03.880
But there's a reason for that, because he has been behind the scenes,

07:03.880 --> 07:09.680
crafting some of the most cutting edge premium earbuds this universe has ever witnessed.

07:09.680 --> 07:11.480
I mean, look at this.

07:11.480 --> 07:14.980
They just go in your ear, wireless, like that.

07:14.980 --> 07:17.280
And if they don't, multiple fits.

07:17.280 --> 07:21.080
As life has always taught me, you got to be prepared for any size.

07:21.080 --> 07:25.880
They even come in this nice rechargeable case, which give your earbuds newfound power.

07:25.880 --> 07:27.780
It's like some sort of magic.

07:27.780 --> 07:30.380
Ray J is basically a sorcerer.

07:30.380 --> 07:32.880
The Harry Potter of premium earbuds.

07:32.880 --> 07:36.480
When I put them in, I feel like a different person.

07:36.480 --> 07:37.980
Wait, that is a different person.

07:37.980 --> 07:39.980
Give my earbuds back, you prick!

07:39.980 --> 07:45.280
There are so many colours, from blue, to red, to black, to red, to blue.

07:45.280 --> 07:46.680
My favourite is red.

07:46.680 --> 07:49.080
It matches with the blood of my enemies.

07:49.080 --> 07:52.280
And it's not just me that is going ballistic.

07:52.280 --> 07:53.180
Insane.

07:53.180 --> 07:59.580
Snoop Dogg, Mike Tyson, and Rich the Kid are all losing their minds over this brand.

07:59.580 --> 08:03.380
Full grown adults, obsessing this is madness.

08:03.380 --> 08:07.280
Well, apart from Rich, I suppose, though, he does look quite mature for a child.

08:07.280 --> 08:09.680
Raycons basically do anything.

08:09.680 --> 08:14.180
Well, they won't cook you dinner, but you can listen to them while you cook your dinner.

08:14.180 --> 08:15.780
Just don't leave that oven on.

08:15.780 --> 08:17.580
Crap.

08:17.580 --> 08:18.980
There goes the house.

08:18.980 --> 08:20.180
Third one this month.

08:20.180 --> 08:24.980
But just put on your talking heads, and you have some real ambience.

08:24.980 --> 08:26.280
To perfect that ambience,

08:26.280 --> 08:29.080
be sure to use the everyday E25s.

08:29.080 --> 08:33.780
Six hours of play, Bluetooth pairing, a more compact design.

08:33.780 --> 08:36.580
Ray J, the absolute madman.

08:36.580 --> 08:39.180
Why? Why did you do that, Ray J?

08:39.180 --> 08:41.980
That model also has some decent reviews as well.

08:41.980 --> 08:42.780
So there's that.

08:42.780 --> 08:48.480
And now Ray is telling me he wants a big, huge, massive gargantuan 15% off

08:48.480 --> 08:50.880
if you click the link in the description below.

08:50.880 --> 08:53.580
By Raycon.com forward slash tro.

08:53.580 --> 08:56.880
That's by Raycon.com forward slash tro.

08:56.880 --> 08:58.680
Bish bash bosh.

08:58.680 --> 09:02.980
Now I know why everybody loves Raymond.

09:02.980 --> 09:07.280
Well, I did say it was a way out.

09:07.280 --> 09:09.080
Now back to the video.

09:15.080 --> 09:19.880
There has been something that we have been hiding for about a month now.

09:19.880 --> 09:25.180
And we're really just so blessed and so excited to share with you guys.

09:25.180 --> 09:30.680
Jim and I have decided that we are going to adopt from China.

09:30.680 --> 09:34.280
We're going to be adopting a little boy from China.

09:34.280 --> 09:37.480
We haven't officially formally started the process yet.

09:37.480 --> 09:42.080
And we do plan on taking y'all with us through the journey and all of the steps along the way.

09:42.080 --> 09:43.280
Yes, it was in this video.

09:43.280 --> 09:47.880
The couple announced their intentions to adopt with the name being decided shortly after.

09:47.880 --> 09:50.080
As some of you may be intending to look it up,

09:50.080 --> 09:53.880
this was the one mentioned earlier in the naming video, not Abercorn, I'll add,

09:53.880 --> 09:55.980
but I shan't be mentioning the name further.

09:55.980 --> 09:58.180
The Stauffers seemed optimistic about their choice,

09:58.180 --> 10:01.280
and in the coming year traveled to China to find their new son.

10:01.280 --> 10:03.580
This adoption was in part supported by GoFundMe,

10:03.580 --> 10:07.980
which was meant to contribute to the costly process that such a task can give rise to.

10:07.980 --> 10:09.880
Adoption is no easy venture.

10:09.880 --> 10:12.280
It shouldn't be like window shopping for a new child.

10:12.280 --> 10:13.280
Even at a young age,

10:13.280 --> 10:18.080
many orphans face acute developmental challenges brought on by the often turbulent environments

10:18.080 --> 10:20.680
and lack of secure attachment figures that come with it.

10:20.680 --> 10:21.380
With this in mind,

10:21.380 --> 10:24.680
there is a lot of respect for those who choose to undertake such an endeavor

10:24.680 --> 10:27.880
and provide a child with the joyful youth that they deserve.

10:27.880 --> 10:29.680
However, they must also be well prepared,

10:29.680 --> 10:33.880
and most of Micah's preparation appeared to amount to reading inspirational quotes.

10:33.880 --> 10:35.680
Like I said, more than anything,

10:35.680 --> 10:36.880
this is our boy,

10:36.880 --> 10:41.880
and we don't need to consult with any more physicians until I bring this little guy home.

10:42.680 --> 10:43.480
He's our son,

10:43.480 --> 10:44.880
and that's that.

10:44.880 --> 10:46.880
He's not going to treat him.

10:46.880 --> 10:48.180
We're not going to return him.

10:48.580 --> 10:49.280
He's our boy.

10:49.980 --> 10:51.780
Now, I just to an extent,

10:51.780 --> 10:55.880
I cannot say exactly what happened behind the scenes when it came to Micah's planning.

10:55.880 --> 11:00.680
However, the way she presented it on her channel may raise a few questions in hindsight.

11:00.980 --> 11:06.180
We sent off our imaging to our physician that's kind of been on board with.

11:06.880 --> 11:08.180
She's been reviewing the files.

11:08.180 --> 11:10.980
She's been very optimistic about this little boy.

11:10.980 --> 11:13.080
She's like, I don't see anything wrong with him.

11:13.080 --> 11:14.880
He looks perfect to me.

11:15.280 --> 11:16.780
And then when she got the imaging,

11:16.780 --> 11:20.180
her optimism went down significantly.

11:20.580 --> 11:23.980
She, and it's nothing against this physician.

11:23.980 --> 11:26.880
You know, she's just listening to what other doctors,

11:26.880 --> 11:32.480
other neurosurgeons and neurodevelopment specialists are telling her.

11:32.780 --> 11:38.280
But her prognosis and everything for our son just went drastic.

11:38.280 --> 11:45.380
She kind of almost discouraged us from adopting him like saying that this is going to be severe.

11:45.380 --> 11:47.180
This is going to be a lot.

11:47.380 --> 11:52.180
There were clearly people around Micah who harbored doubts about the feasibility of the family's ambitions.

11:52.180 --> 11:53.780
Nonetheless, this did not faze them,

11:53.780 --> 11:55.580
and towards the end of 2017,

11:55.580 --> 11:59.180
they uploaded a series of videos which followed them on their adoption journey.

11:59.180 --> 12:01.680
Many of these videos were uploaded onto their second channel,

12:01.680 --> 12:02.680
The Store for Life,

12:02.680 --> 12:08.180
whose presence has been completely expunged from the internet for reasons that we will discuss in due course.

12:08.380 --> 12:12.780
So what we did is we took his CT scans to our second physician

12:12.780 --> 12:16.880
because we had two doctors on board reviewing our son's file.

12:17.280 --> 12:22.280
And that doctor gave us a bet, a much better thought process.

12:22.280 --> 12:24.480
He said, you know what?

12:25.280 --> 12:27.880
What she said could be very well true.

12:27.980 --> 12:30.180
But look at the videos on this little guy.

12:30.180 --> 12:32.480
He is developmentally on track.

12:32.580 --> 12:33.380
He is talking.

12:33.380 --> 12:34.480
He is walking.

12:34.580 --> 12:35.680
He's throwing balls.

12:35.680 --> 12:36.780
He's climbing furniture.

12:36.780 --> 12:37.680
He's acting.

12:37.680 --> 12:45.280
He is walking and talking like a normal one year old and doing things that are beyond his developmental schedule.

12:45.380 --> 12:51.480
So be aware that that little brain may be compensating more than we realize,

12:51.480 --> 12:54.680
and maybe he is just doing just fine.

12:55.080 --> 12:56.580
However, back to China,

12:56.680 --> 13:01.580
all necessary arrangements to ensure a smooth and straightforward adoption have been put in place,

13:01.580 --> 13:06.580
with Micah and her husband traveling out to the adoption clinic where they proceeded to meet prospective candidates

13:06.580 --> 13:07.980
for their nurturing family.

13:08.080 --> 13:10.380
One individual rose above the competition.

13:10.380 --> 13:13.980
Yes, a child that upon encountering Micah just knew was the one,

13:13.980 --> 13:16.380
one that she had a connection with like no other.

13:16.480 --> 13:21.280
And when she felt that, she decided to act on her intuition and finalized this process.

13:21.580 --> 13:25.780
I actually got to see him prior to meeting him.

13:26.080 --> 13:29.180
And when I saw him, I just lost it.

13:29.180 --> 13:31.380
I cried so hard.

13:31.480 --> 13:32.980
My heart couldn't quit beating.

13:32.980 --> 13:35.780
It was just one of those feelings where you just know,

13:35.880 --> 13:36.680
you know,

13:36.680 --> 13:40.780
and it was just the craziest feeling that I've ever felt in my entire life,

13:40.780 --> 13:41.380
which is really,

13:41.380 --> 13:41.980
really cool.

13:42.080 --> 13:43.980
As well as being covered on their second channel,

13:43.980 --> 13:47.580
many of the adoption stages were broadcast on Micah's main account as well,

13:47.680 --> 13:50.280
even receiving its own specialized playlist.

13:50.380 --> 13:52.580
She was clearly very proud of this achievement,

13:52.580 --> 13:56.680
and the video of the adoption day would go on to obtain over five million views.

13:56.680 --> 13:57.380
In these videos,

13:57.380 --> 14:02.380
Micah would present herself as this resolute, uncompromising mother who would never rest on her laurels

14:02.380 --> 14:05.280
or have her commitment to her new son worn down.

14:05.280 --> 14:06.180
If anything,

14:06.280 --> 14:09.480
my child is not returnable.

14:09.680 --> 14:10.080
I,

14:10.080 --> 14:13.180
so when I heard all of the things that that doctor was telling us,

14:13.680 --> 14:16.280
it kind of went in one ear and out the other.

14:16.280 --> 14:17.980
I wasn't in a state of denial.

14:17.980 --> 14:20.880
I accepted and took on everything that she said.

14:20.880 --> 14:21.880
And I sat down with Jim.

14:21.880 --> 14:22.180
I said,

14:22.180 --> 14:22.680
you know,

14:23.380 --> 14:24.780
worst case situation.

14:25.180 --> 14:27.180
If our little boy at one point in his life,

14:27.180 --> 14:30.580
he needs to be in a wheelchair and he needed full on care.

14:30.780 --> 14:31.780
Would you still love him?

14:31.780 --> 14:32.380
And we,

14:32.380 --> 14:33.580
without a doubt in our minds,

14:33.580 --> 14:34.180
we knew.

14:34.580 --> 14:37.080
No matter what state he came to us,

14:37.080 --> 14:38.280
that we would love him.

14:38.780 --> 14:40.280
It's a very stirring sentiment,

14:40.280 --> 14:43.880
and one that would be reiterated over the coming years in YouTube videos,

14:43.880 --> 14:45.080
social media posts,

14:45.080 --> 14:46.480
and even in interviews.

14:46.480 --> 14:48.580
Micah was now not only a health conscious,

14:48.580 --> 14:49.580
hardworking mother,

14:49.580 --> 14:53.280
but she had used her influence to give back to someone much less fortunate.

14:53.280 --> 14:55.980
There was no price that you could put on such an opportunity,

14:55.980 --> 14:59.580
and the child always presented the perception that this was mutual gratitude,

14:59.580 --> 15:01.780
because that's the sort of person that Micah was.

15:01.780 --> 15:03.480
Even when she was giving back,

15:03.480 --> 15:04.980
she was learning so much,

15:04.980 --> 15:07.080
and she was ready to learn more.

15:07.680 --> 15:10.780
I can definitely say that I'm a better mom today,

15:10.780 --> 15:13.680
and I can't wait to see the lessons that he teaches me.

15:13.680 --> 15:14.580
Why am I crying?

15:14.980 --> 15:17.680
I can't wait to see some of the lessons that he teaches me.

15:19.580 --> 15:20.780
Many years from now,

15:20.780 --> 15:24.280
but I just want to tell him if he ever watches this,

15:24.880 --> 15:25.480
thank you.

15:27.080 --> 15:29.480
I wouldn't take back any of those hard days,

15:29.880 --> 15:32.180
or any of those moments,

15:32.180 --> 15:35.280
because I've taught me so much,

15:35.280 --> 15:40.180
and I just pray to be an amazing mom to him,

15:40.180 --> 15:44.180
and just take the best care of my family as I humanly possibly can.

15:44.280 --> 15:47.280
However, some lessons are harder than others.

15:47.680 --> 15:48.080
You see,

15:48.080 --> 15:50.880
their new son was a greater challenge than one had anticipated,

15:50.880 --> 15:51.980
because according to Micah,

15:51.980 --> 15:55.680
the Chinese adoption center's experts had misdiagnosed him.

15:55.680 --> 15:56.180
In fact,

15:56.180 --> 15:57.380
in an interview with The Bump,

15:57.380 --> 16:01.480
Micah stated that the adoption agency had commented that he suffers from a small brain tumor.

16:01.580 --> 16:04.080
This should not have affected his cognitive ability.

16:04.080 --> 16:04.380
However,

16:04.380 --> 16:06.680
they observed behaviors which they couldn't explain,

16:06.680 --> 16:07.680
such as biting,

16:07.680 --> 16:08.280
pinching,

16:08.280 --> 16:09.880
and banging his head against a wall.

16:10.080 --> 16:14.580
The couple observed that he must have been more developmentally challenged than they had initially assumed,

16:14.580 --> 16:16.080
and after multiple consultations,

16:16.080 --> 16:19.780
it was revealed that the child had actually experienced a stroke while in utero,

16:19.780 --> 16:21.880
and this was stifling his mental faculty.

16:22.280 --> 16:22.780
Originally,

16:22.780 --> 16:25.280
it was thought that this setback was only temporary,

16:25.380 --> 16:28.980
and that the Stauffer's new son would easily catch up with his peers over time.

16:29.080 --> 16:29.380
However,

16:29.380 --> 16:30.280
this was not the case,

16:30.280 --> 16:33.680
and after a series of further evaluations through an expensive health system,

16:33.680 --> 16:36.480
the son in question was diagnosed with level three autism.

16:36.480 --> 16:38.980
This is the most serious diagnosis on the spectrum,

16:39.080 --> 16:42.880
and a person suffering from it will face serious challenges in social interaction.

16:42.880 --> 16:47.280
It is also noted that they will require high levels of support to help them manage their condition.

16:47.680 --> 16:49.180
In this 2019 article,

16:49.180 --> 16:52.980
Micah reflects on the diagnosis and states that after a period of introspection,

16:52.980 --> 16:55.080
she realized the problem wasn't with her son,

16:55.280 --> 16:56.280
but with herself,

16:56.280 --> 16:57.380
and that this affliction,

16:57.380 --> 16:58.380
although challenging,

16:58.380 --> 17:00.680
only served to illuminate the beauty of life.

17:00.880 --> 17:01.580
To quote,

17:01.780 --> 17:04.580
He taught me to quit giving a damn what other people think.

17:04.680 --> 17:07.080
When people stare at you and judge your parenting skills,

17:07.080 --> 17:11.080
you have to learn to let those horrible looks and mean words roll right off your shoulder.

17:11.280 --> 17:13.780
Parenting a child with autism looks very different,

17:13.780 --> 17:15.680
and people don't know how to perceive that.

17:15.880 --> 17:16.580
To be frank,

17:16.680 --> 17:18.180
they don't have to understand.

17:18.380 --> 17:21.180
All that matters is that we're doing the best for our family.

17:21.580 --> 17:22.780
We still have hard days.

17:22.780 --> 17:24.880
I still seek guidance and ask for help,

17:24.880 --> 17:26.980
and sometimes I still break down in tears.

17:27.080 --> 17:32.480
But the one thing I know for sure is that our son doesn't go a day without being endlessly loved.

17:32.580 --> 17:33.680
Adoption is love.

17:33.880 --> 17:35.080
It takes a lot of grit,

17:35.280 --> 17:35.580
sweat,

17:35.580 --> 17:36.280
and tears,

17:36.580 --> 17:38.280
but it's so worth it in the end.

17:38.780 --> 17:41.280
Even if your ending looks different than you had planned,

17:41.580 --> 17:42.380
just remember,

17:42.680 --> 17:44.680
different isn't a bad thing.

17:44.980 --> 17:46.380
This was Micah's philosophy,

17:46.480 --> 17:50.180
and one that she continued to advocate for right up to 2020.

17:50.280 --> 17:55.080
This year has been so amazing to kind of affirm those questions in my head

17:55.080 --> 17:56.380
and let me know that like,

17:56.880 --> 17:58.680
I am fighting the right fight.

17:58.680 --> 18:01.080
I am doing what is best for my kiddo.

18:01.380 --> 18:05.780
There's so many days that I'm just so grateful that I got the opportunity to get to be your mama.

18:06.380 --> 18:06.880
And

18:07.380 --> 18:09.180
he is my son through and through.

18:09.180 --> 18:10.380
He's my baby boy,

18:10.380 --> 18:10.980
and I am

18:12.580 --> 18:13.980
so glad that

18:14.580 --> 18:16.180
he is part of our family.

18:16.580 --> 18:17.380
I couldn't

18:18.380 --> 18:20.380
I couldn't do my day without him.

18:20.380 --> 18:20.980
So,

18:21.780 --> 18:22.980
what changed?

18:34.380 --> 18:36.180
Micah was a content creator.

18:36.380 --> 18:38.180
When she found a formula that people enjoyed,

18:38.180 --> 18:39.980
she would deliver it again

18:40.380 --> 18:41.180
and again

18:41.380 --> 18:42.180
and again.

18:42.580 --> 18:46.180
And that truth was no different to the content she released with her adopted son.

18:47.180 --> 18:51.380
I'm so grateful, so blessed, and so thankful all at the same time.

18:51.580 --> 18:53.980
Just because things are hard doesn't mean they're bad.

18:53.980 --> 18:56.180
It just means it takes a lot of work.

18:56.380 --> 18:58.580
And one day I'll be so grateful for

18:59.180 --> 19:02.980
all the hard work and all the time and all the energy put into our baby.

19:02.980 --> 19:07.580
She was an individual who wanted to present herself as the embodiment of the can-do mindset.

19:07.580 --> 19:09.780
She may face hurdles, but she was braced for them,

19:09.780 --> 19:13.080
and she was ready for the difference that she would make through overcoming them.

19:13.680 --> 19:17.480
Many creators, particularly vloggers, present their content as this journey,

19:17.480 --> 19:20.680
and we will see them hit a milestone, and it will feel good.

19:20.880 --> 19:22.880
It provides the impression of progress.

19:22.880 --> 19:26.080
It's what reels in a lot of audiences, and with Micah's son,

19:26.080 --> 19:29.880
there was an opportunity to show more than the basic developmental breakthroughs.

19:30.280 --> 19:32.880
In the years following the adoption, in spite of the challenges,

19:32.880 --> 19:35.880
Micah documented many of these milestones that her son reached.

19:35.880 --> 19:39.480
People tuned in for this, providing the mother with a consistent level of growth.

19:39.480 --> 19:42.080
However, this was also a troublesome formula.

19:42.080 --> 19:44.880
As a blogger, you choose how much of your life is presented.

19:44.880 --> 19:46.180
It's a nice privilege.

19:46.180 --> 19:50.380
However, at the same time, this presentation also has a bearing on how you are perceived.

19:50.380 --> 19:54.380
Micah chose to depict her life in a way that painted the environment as challenging,

19:54.380 --> 19:59.180
yet manageable, with the occasional inspirational speech about how she was going to pull through,

19:59.180 --> 20:00.980
the sort of person who would never give up.

20:00.980 --> 20:04.880
So the worst thing that she could do in any circumstance is to give up.

20:04.880 --> 20:07.680
To many, she would not only be betraying her adopted son,

20:07.680 --> 20:11.380
but she would be betraying the spirit that she had constantly promoted on her channel,

20:11.380 --> 20:13.180
and compromise her own mantra.

20:13.480 --> 20:14.780
How could you do that?

20:15.080 --> 20:16.980
Well, let's move to the present year.

20:17.180 --> 20:20.480
Now, the start of 2020 is where the schedule becomes a bit murky,

20:20.480 --> 20:24.180
mainly because no one was particularly concerned with what Micah Stauffer was doing.

20:24.180 --> 20:27.780
She continued to upload content about her family, nothing particularly new.

20:27.780 --> 20:30.580
However, there was an increasing absence of the son of interest.

20:30.580 --> 20:33.880
Micah had given birth to a new child named Onyx the year before,

20:33.880 --> 20:36.980
and in January, they took their newborn on a vacation to Bali,

20:36.980 --> 20:39.280
implying that the other children had been left at home.

20:39.280 --> 20:44.180
The last public statement made regarding his well-being prior to this fateful video was released in February.

20:44.180 --> 20:48.880
This post appeared to divulge difficulties regarding coping with their child's temperamental nature.

20:48.880 --> 20:52.780
Following that post, the son ceased to make appearances on the family's social media,

20:52.780 --> 20:56.980
with both Jim and Micah making comments alluding to adversity in their lives.

20:56.980 --> 21:00.580
However, as they were not specific, there was little people could deduce from it.

21:00.580 --> 21:05.580
Nonetheless, as time passed, people became increasingly suspicious as to their child's whereabouts,

21:05.580 --> 21:07.880
and began to apply pressure onto the couple.

21:07.880 --> 21:12.480
Users began to speculate in forums, and in the comment sections of the Stauffer's social media,

21:12.480 --> 21:15.080
shedding further light onto the unanswered question.

21:15.080 --> 21:19.080
People started constructing hypotheses as to what exactly happened to their young'un,

21:19.080 --> 21:22.580
and these rumours were only going to gather momentum if left unaddressed.

21:22.580 --> 21:24.480
After all, he is your son.

21:24.480 --> 21:28.080
So on the 26th of May, the Stauffers decide to set the record straight,

21:28.080 --> 21:30.880
and provide people with an update on their family.

21:31.280 --> 21:37.280
So this is by far the hardest video James and I have ever publicly had to make.

21:37.280 --> 21:39.480
How do you break bad news?

21:39.480 --> 21:43.080
It's a tough one, especially when that news is equally bad news for yourself,

21:43.080 --> 21:46.580
and make no mistake, this was an awful scenario for Micah to find herself in.

21:46.580 --> 21:50.080
Not only was she going to undermine the tons of rhetoric she had espoused,

21:50.080 --> 21:51.680
she had to explain why.

21:51.680 --> 21:56.280
This was obviously an upsetting decision for any family to enact,

21:56.280 --> 21:58.980
and must have been made with a heavy heart.

21:58.980 --> 22:03.380
Therefore, it was understandably a difficult subject for them to speak about.

22:03.380 --> 22:08.280
However, at the same time, this decision was clearly one taken with great deliberation,

22:08.280 --> 22:13.180
and these Stauffers can take all the time they need to justify it in a way that makes sense.

22:13.180 --> 22:18.780
They had ample time to prepare an explanation that was empathetic to people's inevitable objections,

22:18.780 --> 22:21.580
but still made sense of the dilemma that they had been placed in.

22:22.080 --> 22:23.380
Did they manage that?

22:23.380 --> 22:26.780
Well, let's discuss the content of the video first.

22:26.780 --> 22:31.580
Micah opens by thanking her amazing viewers for respecting their son's privacy,

22:31.580 --> 22:34.480
which apparently helped her through some really hard times,

22:34.480 --> 22:37.980
before becoming surprisingly emotional very quickly.

22:37.980 --> 22:45.280
...we have some viewers who have been just, like, so incredibly kind and respectful of our son's privacy.

22:45.280 --> 22:50.980
I just want to say thank you, like, that really got me through some really hard times,

22:50.980 --> 22:52.680
and I just want to say thanks.

22:52.680 --> 22:57.780
Like, you have no idea what that means to me,

22:57.780 --> 23:02.380
and some of the special messages that you've sent, like, just thank you.

23:02.380 --> 23:03.980
Thank you for the moment.

23:04.680 --> 23:10.080
James then cuts in, well, he's cut in paying tribute to Micah's character,

23:10.080 --> 23:14.180
informing everyone how hard she has tried throughout this whole situation,

23:14.180 --> 23:16.480
before going into the details of the situation.

23:16.480 --> 23:21.880
As stated elsewhere, the seriousness of their son's condition wasn't understood until he was back in the US,

23:21.880 --> 23:25.980
and although he had been receiving therapy, the issue appears to have not resolved itself.

23:25.980 --> 23:28.980
In fact, the treatment has only intensified in the last year,

23:28.980 --> 23:32.280
and the prognosis from professionals was clearly not optimistic.

23:32.280 --> 23:35.280
This upsets James to the point where he becomes emotional,

23:35.280 --> 23:37.980
once again emphasising how much they have tried.

23:37.980 --> 23:41.280
Micah tag-teams in and rephrases James' comments.

23:41.880 --> 23:45.780
There's not an ounce of our body that doesn't love you over me,

23:45.780 --> 23:49.380
and there wasn't a minute that I didn't try our hardest,

23:49.380 --> 23:57.880
and I think what James is trying to say is that after multiple assessments,

23:57.880 --> 24:05.280
after multiple evaluations, numerous medical professionals have felt that he needed a different fit,

24:05.280 --> 24:08.480
and that his medical needs, he needed more.

24:08.880 --> 24:12.280
They then bring up why they haven't spoken about this situation prior.

24:12.280 --> 24:15.380
According to them, they were trying to protect their son's privacy,

24:15.380 --> 24:21.480
and wanted to avoid any legal ramifications, which appears to be quite an emotional topic for Micah once again.

24:21.480 --> 24:27.280
Micah- And that's why, like, on Instagram and stuff, I've tried to, like, let you know as little as I could,

24:27.280 --> 24:31.980
but I couldn't tell you anymore because I didn't want to mess anything up.

24:32.780 --> 24:38.280
This is followed by the couple repeating this, before elaborating on the nature of their content,

24:38.280 --> 24:42.280
and indirectly responding to some of the criticism that they had been receiving,

24:42.280 --> 24:48.280
which admittedly seemed a bit off-key for a video on such a topic, but I suppose I can see the loose connection.

24:48.280 --> 24:52.880
Micah- Worse, it's not about me at all, but it's just, like, this journey has been,

24:53.680 --> 24:58.480
the last couple months have been, like, the hardest thing I could have ever imagined going to,

24:58.480 --> 25:07.680
choosing to do, because ultimately, after pouring our guts and our heart into this little boy...

25:08.480 --> 25:11.380
But what did the criticism in question ensue?

25:11.880 --> 25:13.780
Well, let's talk about that.

25:22.180 --> 25:30.080
Micah- Anything that happened in the home that was hard for- that's not fair for me to put out there publicly,

25:30.080 --> 25:37.180
that's his privacy, so we're not gonna talk about that, that's not appropriate, and that'll never be appropriate.

25:37.180 --> 25:42.380
As we've observed throughout this video, Micah was always one to display many aspects of her life,

25:42.380 --> 25:45.380
even ones that most families would consider invasive.

25:45.380 --> 25:51.080
This was not out of the ordinary for the genre, however, there are further conditions which many would argue

25:51.080 --> 25:54.080
make Micah's handling in her videos exploitive.

25:54.480 --> 25:58.280
First of all, her son's condition. In spite of my personal reservations,

25:58.280 --> 26:01.680
most people aren't looking to topple the whole family vlogging scene.

26:01.680 --> 26:05.880
However, when you're dealing with a child with an already fragile background,

26:05.880 --> 26:11.180
sticking him in front of a camera can be questionable, especially if his affliction affects his ability

26:11.180 --> 26:16.280
to signal consent, something which many would argue is already limited in a young child.

26:16.680 --> 26:19.380
Secondly, Micah's approach to content creation.

26:19.380 --> 26:22.980
I spoke about the repetitive nature of her videos, and with many topics,

26:22.980 --> 26:26.380
that could be perceived as a person returning to the source of success.

26:26.480 --> 26:31.580
However, when the source of success is a topic more sensitive, particularly when that story isn't your own,

26:31.580 --> 26:35.480
returning to it in a way that may seem excessive could draw in criticism.

26:35.480 --> 26:38.880
Micah didn't just regularly talk about the topic of adoption on her channel.

26:38.880 --> 26:44.880
She also participated in promotions, even integrating them into portrayals of her relationship with her son.

26:44.880 --> 26:50.880
In this Instagram post, she talks about how she wouldn't trade her son for anything, sponsored by Dreft.

26:50.880 --> 26:57.380
And last but far from least, the context that such a decision would shine on Micah's previous statements and actions.

26:57.380 --> 27:02.380
The mother-son loyalty was a regular selling point for the channel, and people began to hypothesize that

27:02.380 --> 27:06.880
Micah was only interested in having an adopted son for as long as it was profitable,

27:06.880 --> 27:10.980
and the fact that this was no longer the case meant that she had decided to give him up,

27:10.980 --> 27:14.680
in spite of all the inspirational detergent-sponsored rhetoric.

27:14.680 --> 27:19.780
To summarize, these distractors believed that Micah Stauffer had capitalized on the profitability of such a topic

27:19.780 --> 27:24.280
when it suited her, and threw in the towel when the costs outweighed the benefits.

27:24.280 --> 27:30.280
This is quite a serious theory, and in many ways, it was understandable that the Stauffers wanted to set the record straight.

27:30.280 --> 27:34.180
However, I'll add that these hypotheses were not particularly popular at the time,

27:34.180 --> 27:37.480
especially given that people weren't sure as to the child's location.

27:37.480 --> 27:43.080
Their primary priority should have been to clear up any ambiguity regarding their son's whereabouts,

27:43.080 --> 27:47.580
but they can't seem to resist the temptation to explain and justify themselves.

27:47.580 --> 27:54.180
I didn't adopt a little boy to share these things publicly.

27:54.180 --> 27:58.380
What you're left with is this very awkward video, which only worsens as it goes on.

27:58.380 --> 28:01.380
It feels like they are more interested in justifying themselves,

28:01.380 --> 28:05.980
but when your justification amounts to the appeal to knowledge that the audience doesn't have access to,

28:05.980 --> 28:11.180
then you have to rely on their trust in your own authority, which clearly didn't work with Micah and Jimothy here.

28:11.780 --> 28:16.680
Every now and then you may have gotten like a teeny like struggle or like a hardship

28:16.680 --> 28:22.380
when I was trying to be like really raw and real, but we haven't intentionally.

28:22.380 --> 28:27.080
The video was designed for their own audience, people who were going to innately trust what the Stauffers said.

28:27.080 --> 28:31.980
However, it didn't take more than a couple days for this video to begin circulating outside the fan base,

28:31.980 --> 28:37.480
and for it to attract the attention of more skeptical viewers who found their explanations rather unsatisfactory.

28:37.480 --> 28:43.480
99 95% of the struggles we have never publicly aired ever.

28:43.480 --> 28:47.080
99 95. What's the difference?

28:47.080 --> 28:51.580
The video plays out like a half baked lawyer statement read by a second rate theater actor.

28:51.580 --> 28:57.280
It feels like they're trying to convey emotion while dancing around any details that may actually implicate them,

28:57.280 --> 29:01.580
essentially using tears as a shield to evade further challenges to their character.

29:01.580 --> 29:06.080
They do compose themselves a bit more towards the end, but at this point it was rather futile,

29:06.080 --> 29:10.680
and they still continue to attempt to justify their now clearly slanted portrayal.

29:10.680 --> 29:17.480
We may come on socials like when I, for my channel, the reason I started my channel is to be positive and to bring people positivity,

29:17.580 --> 29:21.780
even though we're struggling and that when we talk about hugs, it's a huge win for us.

29:21.780 --> 29:29.980
Just because I may be positive on my stories or be having fun doing something fun doesn't mean that I'm not like still horribly hurting,

29:29.980 --> 29:31.280
and the same for Jim.

29:31.280 --> 29:36.780
It's obvious they're quite aware of how this revelation comes into conflict with a majority of their timeline,

29:36.780 --> 29:39.180
so Micah has done her best to explain this away,

29:39.180 --> 29:44.380
and it's not like I would be particularly angry at the fact that they were previously hopeful and optimistic,

29:44.380 --> 29:50.780
and that forecast has since changed, changes happen, and our expectations may be subverted.

29:50.780 --> 29:54.180
However, the explanation just makes it worse.

29:54.180 --> 30:01.080
With pure intent of respecting his privacy, not to give you a fake facade or to be lack of transparency,

30:01.080 --> 30:06.980
but to respect our son's privacy, and this is all that we're okay with sharing.

30:06.980 --> 30:12.580
Because what Micah's explanation here implies is that these challenges were apparent from ages back,

30:12.580 --> 30:18.680
and that they just chose not to broadcast them out of respect for their son's privacy, which seems all well and good,

30:18.680 --> 30:24.480
but at the same time, why would you consciously promote an attitude or perception that was at odds with the reality?

30:24.480 --> 30:30.880
It's important to remember that your content may have a great influence on the decision that audience members make with regards to adopting,

30:30.880 --> 30:34.680
and omitting such details will deceive people whether you intend to or not.

30:34.680 --> 30:39.880
On top of this, given the degree of coverage Micah provided to the adoption journey and the post-adoption life,

30:39.880 --> 30:47.980
the defence of privacy was hard for many to buy, particularly given the fact that many of these videos were still public at the time of this sombre upload.

30:47.980 --> 30:52.980
This once again made these comments feel like they were using the privacy card to deflect criticism,

30:52.980 --> 30:58.180
implying that anyone who decided to cover these antics from here on out would be disrespecting their son,

30:58.180 --> 31:01.780
despite them being the ones who uploaded the original content.

31:01.780 --> 31:06.880
The Stalkers obviously anticipated the incoming criticism, and questions that they would face,

31:06.880 --> 31:13.680
however, in attempting to prematurely respond to them, they drew more attention towards the lack of consistency within their justifications,

31:13.680 --> 31:18.880
and in turn, only appeared to give further credence to the unforgiving theory surrounding their conduct,

31:18.880 --> 31:25.380
and catalyzing a tidal wave of backlash, focused on exposing the Stalkers and their substandard parenting skills.

31:25.780 --> 31:27.180
Let's talk about that then.

31:37.580 --> 31:43.980
If Micah had made a video talking about the re-homing of her son, she could have outlined basic non-invasive details,

31:43.980 --> 31:48.680
before conveying remorse about the possible misrepresentation that her content had conveyed,

31:48.680 --> 31:51.880
while committing to protecting his privacy from here on out.

31:51.880 --> 31:54.780
That would have at least curbed some of the criticism.

31:54.780 --> 31:57.680
Unfortunately, she decided to give us this instead.

31:58.080 --> 32:05.580
Micah's Mom- Thank you for everything, and we just really appreciate all of your support and kindness, but just please respect our privacy.

32:05.580 --> 32:06.680
Micah's Dad- I respect his too.

32:06.780 --> 32:12.880
The Stalkers video was like a challenge to the internet, and those residents were more than willing to take up the couple on their claims

32:12.880 --> 32:17.280
that this was all a privacy issue, and that they had really tried their hardest.

32:17.280 --> 32:23.680
As noticed, when this video was first released, Micah still had her videos about the adoption process public and fully monetized.

32:23.680 --> 32:27.780
This became a source of criticism in the first few days where these uploads remained visible,

32:27.780 --> 32:32.680
with a petition demanding the removal of them obtaining over 150,000 signatures.

32:32.680 --> 32:39.280
It didn't take too long, but the Stalkers to respond by privating nearly all their content involving their adopted son around the turn of June.

32:39.280 --> 32:42.480
This may have quelled the criticism if it was the sole talking point.

32:42.480 --> 32:50.080
However, in leaving the content accessible, Micah and her husband also left it prone to deeper analysis that would kick up a bit of a buzz,

32:50.080 --> 32:52.080
a sort of hornet's nest buzz.

32:52.080 --> 32:56.480
Micah- If anything, my child is not returnable.

32:56.480 --> 33:01.380
Clips like the ones I briefly touched on earlier were circulating on the more moderate end of the criticisms,

33:01.380 --> 33:06.580
mostly with the purpose of emphasizing the Stauffer's convenient disregard for professional advice in the past,

33:06.580 --> 33:10.480
which seems somewhat ironic given how heavily it is referenced in the new video.

33:10.480 --> 33:15.780
It's unclear exactly when this U-turn happened, and although I'm sure people are pleased that Micah was actually listening,

33:15.780 --> 33:18.280
some found it a bit too well timed to their liking.

33:18.280 --> 33:23.880
Other people went straight for the fabric of the Stauffer's narrative, particularly regarding how much they hadn't shown.

33:23.880 --> 33:33.280
Micah- No more. Come on, let's go. You're not gonna throw a fit when you don't get your way. That's not okay. Let's go.

33:33.280 --> 33:43.880
Are you done fitting? Are you done? Are you all done?

33:43.880 --> 33:53.080
Now, Micah sent the audience mixed signals when she strangely decided to alter 99-95%, almost as if she was attempting to calculate it herself.

33:53.080 --> 33:57.280
However, what did that hypothetical 5% entail?

33:57.280 --> 34:02.080
Micah- It's been crazy, so it's nice for everyone to start getting back on schedule.

34:02.080 --> 34:03.480
What did you do?

34:03.480 --> 34:05.280
I just did a thing.

34:05.280 --> 34:09.980
Micah- See? You look like Ruka. You gave him a Ruka cut.

34:09.980 --> 34:12.180
Was he like five million times cuter?

34:12.180 --> 34:17.580
Oh my gosh, there's still hair all over the kids. Like, he was mad. He was like, we're not doing this.

34:17.580 --> 34:24.180
Right. Well, although not always captured in the highest definition, many people archived uploaded clips where the Stauffers

34:24.180 --> 34:29.580
behaved in ways that appeared unbecoming of them as parents, particularly given the status of their son.

34:29.580 --> 34:35.380
This included a lot of filming that one may consider invasive, particularly when he appeared to be in distress,

34:35.380 --> 34:38.580
the aforementioned clip coming from a video where they shaved his head.

34:38.580 --> 34:44.480
However, this was far from the only incriminating recording, and the existence of multiple examples began to circulate

34:44.480 --> 34:47.880
and depict a pattern of behavior which was less than flattering.

34:47.880 --> 34:50.680
Micah- Did you have fun getting candy, big man?

34:50.680 --> 34:53.880
He has had multiple meltdowns.

34:53.880 --> 34:55.080
Micah- I'm not having a good day today.

34:55.080 --> 34:57.280
We never tell you guys the truth.

34:57.280 --> 35:00.280
And that's why you don't see other people on the vlog.

35:00.280 --> 35:02.880
He's probably having a meltdown.

35:02.880 --> 35:04.680
Are you done?

35:04.680 --> 35:07.180
Micah- He's just having a bad day. He's a grumpy day today.

35:07.180 --> 35:13.180
In this rather unnerving video, Micah seems to shame her son with all the swagger of Cruella De Vil meets Wine Mum.

35:13.180 --> 35:18.180
Micah- All the things you wish you knew about my little boy, but we don't talk about that.

35:18.180 --> 35:21.880
I'm not entirely sure the exact date of this post, but once again,

35:21.880 --> 35:26.780
it didn't seem to fit in line with the mother who tried her hardest point of view.

35:26.780 --> 35:32.380
On the one hand, I am willing to understand that it would have been confusing and frustrating when their adopted son was

35:32.380 --> 35:38.480
first brought home and behaved in ways that challenged the family's precondition views of what raising a child would be like.

35:38.480 --> 35:42.380
But there is a line, and too much of this content was already crossing it,

35:42.380 --> 35:46.180
and they should have known better by then, and many people believe they did.

35:56.680 --> 36:01.180
What are you doing in there, man? Reorganizing the shoe closet for me, eh?

36:02.980 --> 36:04.380
It's a silly boy, huh?

36:04.380 --> 36:08.580
The most worrisome of videos was this one, where James Dorfer appears to discover their son in the closet,

36:08.580 --> 36:13.580
with duct tape around his wrist, the implication here being that Micah applied the duct tape to prevent their son from

36:13.580 --> 36:17.080
sucking his thumb, with critics branding it as reckless and hypocritical,

36:17.080 --> 36:20.980
particularly given that another one of their biological children was also caught sucking their thumb,

36:20.980 --> 36:23.080
and Micah didn't appear to react to that at all.

36:23.080 --> 36:27.880
With all this in mind, many people's outlook on Micah's motives became even more pessimistic,

36:27.880 --> 36:33.680
with the idea that she was actually harboring resentment for her son, and was channeling frustration into punitive measures.

36:34.480 --> 36:40.780
We're having meltdowns because we've already had breakfast, and we just want to keep eating,

36:40.780 --> 36:45.680
and it's not time to eat, so we're gonna sit down. Sit down.

36:46.880 --> 36:49.080
We have to wait. You can have a snack.

36:49.080 --> 36:53.580
I don't have a problem giving him as much food as he wants. It's more principle.

36:53.580 --> 36:59.080
It's about we don't just throw fits to get our way, so we're trying to work through that.

36:59.080 --> 37:03.080
Another user found what appeared to be screenshots of Micah posting onto a Facebook group,

37:03.080 --> 37:07.380
stating that she was considering adopting once more, but looking for something more low maintenance.

37:07.380 --> 37:12.980
There is also a statement where she seems bothered by the fact that her son has a way of looking at people every time he eats.

37:12.980 --> 37:15.980
According to her, it drives the husband bonkers.

37:15.980 --> 37:18.280
It really was a tough time for the Stauffers.

37:18.280 --> 37:24.080
The most allegedly telling post here is the one where Micah asked what learning difficulties most would consider challenging,

37:24.080 --> 37:27.080
but the members of the adoption group would consider easy,

37:27.080 --> 37:32.680
implying once more that she was only concerned with how an adopted child might be perceived by the audience.

37:33.080 --> 37:36.880
This only brought their motives into further contention when it came to the adoption process.

37:36.880 --> 37:43.380
People also found a comment of her stating that her son wanted this, despite the many documented communication issues that he has.

37:43.380 --> 37:48.480
It was also alleged that given their trip to Bali, the Stauffers made their decision to give up the son in January

37:48.480 --> 37:50.680
and take in the holiday once he had gone.

37:50.680 --> 37:56.680
Although this is an intriguing theory, I do believe other videos around that time did show the son still in the household.

37:56.980 --> 38:01.780
Regardless, people no longer trusted Micah to be honest in her videos when talking about this issue.

38:01.780 --> 38:04.880
Much of the additional context not only contradicted her narrative,

38:04.880 --> 38:07.880
but brought into question the entire chronology of her channel,

38:07.880 --> 38:12.680
with the implication that she was more interested in how she could milk her son's adoption journey financially

38:12.680 --> 38:14.580
than she was in her son's well being.

38:14.580 --> 38:20.280
It was not a favorable portrait, and as the pressure mounted, Micah began to face the consequences.

38:24.080 --> 38:27.080
There are plenty of ways that one can sustain public criticism.

38:27.080 --> 38:31.080
However, today's condemnation was mostly promulgated from within the Twitter sphere,

38:31.080 --> 38:33.580
which I typically feel quite ambivalent about.

38:33.580 --> 38:39.380
Twitter is probably one of the platforms most susceptible to mob mentality, and I'm not a fan of mob mentality.

38:39.380 --> 38:44.380
It is very easy to select parts of a story which are the most emotionally rousing and presented in a way

38:44.380 --> 38:49.780
that is tailored towards receiving public recognition rather than representing a fair perspective.

38:49.780 --> 38:54.380
However, with this in mind, it was hard for many to see the Stauffer side at all.

38:54.380 --> 39:00.380
They were choosing not to defend themselves further, and even without commentary, their actions had spoken for themselves.

39:00.380 --> 39:05.980
So many users set their sights on those associated with the Stauffers, most notably the brands,

39:05.980 --> 39:09.180
and brands are notoriously vulnerable to negative publicity.

39:09.180 --> 39:14.680
You saw it recently with G Fuel and Keemstar, a person universally renowned for controversy,

39:14.680 --> 39:19.980
losing their support because suddenly people decide to specifically target that relationship.

39:19.980 --> 39:25.680
Brands seem to care less about what people have actually done, and more about how many people complain.

39:25.680 --> 39:30.180
In her stint online, Micah had accumulated an impressive entourage of sponsors,

39:30.180 --> 39:32.780
including one she had used her adopted son to promote.

39:32.780 --> 39:38.780
I already mentioned the Dreff sponsorship, but another quote from a video had her directly crediting the fabric softener

39:38.780 --> 39:43.380
for enhancing their bond, however, the last time that they had worked together was 2018,

39:43.380 --> 39:48.380
so clearly the lack of Dreff's presence in the relationship had put a strain on the family.

39:48.380 --> 39:56.080
Dreff themselves did leave a comment in peak centrist form, stating that it was a sad and difficult situation for everyone involved.

39:56.080 --> 39:58.680
Thank you Dreff for that insightful contribution.

39:58.680 --> 40:04.480
However, they did emphasise they were not working with the Stauffers, while also implying they would not be working with them in the future.

40:04.480 --> 40:11.180
Other brands were also fast to distance themselves from the mother of four, including Huggies, Mattel, Danimals, and Chili's.

40:11.180 --> 40:16.380
However, the most blunt severance came from Kate Hudson's brand Fabletics, who had previously worked with Micah.

40:16.380 --> 40:22.680
Upon being notified of the situation, Hudson informed an Instagram user that Stauffer had been terminated,

40:22.680 --> 40:28.080
a rather definite stance. Although it became clear at the time that most brands were not working with Micah,

40:28.080 --> 40:33.280
nor considering it, this sort of public pressure will likely follow through to prospective deals in the future,

40:33.280 --> 40:37.680
tearing a pretty gaping hole into the channel's potential for coming sponsorships.

40:37.680 --> 40:43.880
Nonetheless, some still felt that this was not sufficient retribution for Micah's actions, particularly given some of the clips,

40:43.880 --> 40:47.480
and decided to take it one step further. What do I mean exactly?

40:47.580 --> 40:52.880
While in their video breaking the news, the Stauffers disclosed that they didn't put their son through the system.

40:52.880 --> 40:59.080
In fact, they quote, handpicked out a new forever family for him, which at least should inspire some confidence.

40:59.080 --> 41:07.480
Kate Hudson- And they found somebody that they felt would be ultimately the best fit, and he is thriving, he is very happy,

41:07.480 --> 41:17.680
he's doing really well, and his new mommy has medical professional training, and it is a very good fit.

41:17.680 --> 41:22.880
To build onto this faith, the lawyers, you know, the people who definitely don't have any vested interest at all,

41:22.880 --> 41:28.980
came forward to say what great people the Stauffers were as well, highlighting their caring and thoughtful nature.

41:28.980 --> 41:35.980
To be honest, their message told the same story, there was just less crying, which was appreciated, but certainly not all vindicating.

41:35.980 --> 41:41.980
And unfortunately, as people's questions about the Stauffer's conduct persisted, many began to inquire about the adopted son,

41:41.980 --> 41:47.180
and if he was really in safe hands. Combine this with the already damning footage being collated online,

41:47.180 --> 41:51.580
and with enough reports, law enforcement were compelled into opening a case on the couple.

41:51.580 --> 41:57.580
Now, I think most people didn't expect anything to come of this because there was nothing abjectly criminal,

41:57.580 --> 42:03.380
just some pretty subpar parenting, but people presented the complaints, and the authorities pursued it accordingly.

42:03.380 --> 42:07.380
The first task was to locate the child. This was more of a challenge than it initially seemed,

42:07.380 --> 42:12.280
because the Stauffers didn't go through any state systems which would keep records of the child's whereabouts.

42:12.280 --> 42:18.980
In an interview with the Sheriff's Office, they stated they were working with multiple agencies to pinpoint the two-time adoptee's residence.

42:18.980 --> 42:23.780
This provoked numerous news outlets and creators to run the story that the child had been lost,

42:23.780 --> 42:26.780
making some wonder if something more sinister was afoot.

42:26.780 --> 42:32.680
Fortunately, he was located, and in a statement shortly after, the police stated that they were confident that the Stauffers had followed

42:32.680 --> 42:38.880
the appropriate adoption measures, but were still investigating any alleged wrongdoing, and touching base with all parties involved.

42:38.880 --> 42:44.880
I would assume this investigation lasted throughout June, but the Stauffers likely remained silent due to the ongoing case,

42:44.880 --> 42:49.680
though they did still find the time to remove their update video after it accrued over five million views.

42:49.680 --> 42:55.980
Towards the end of the month, Micah would put out a post on her Instagram, first apologising unreservedly for all the hurt she caused,

42:55.980 --> 43:01.380
and admitting she was ill-prepared for the adoption, opening up about her shortcomings in the adoption process,

43:01.380 --> 43:04.780
and conceding that she was naive, foolish, and arrogant.

43:04.780 --> 43:10.780
She finishes by addressing a couple of external allegations, averring that she did not adopt a son to gain wealth,

43:10.780 --> 43:14.380
and in fact asserting that they invested a lot of money back into his care.

43:14.380 --> 43:19.580
She also affirms that they are not under any investigation, which is slightly confusing given that a few days later,

43:19.580 --> 43:25.180
the Delaware County Sheriff's Office released a statement announcing the completion of their quote investigation,

43:25.180 --> 43:30.780
but I'm gonna assume Micah doesn't believe her audience are that stupid, and chalk it up to a terminological oversight.

43:30.780 --> 43:36.980
Either way, both parties conclude that no egregious malpractice has occurred, and that everyone is where they should be,

43:36.980 --> 43:39.780
which should at least provide some solace to those concerned.

43:40.180 --> 43:45.280
Micah's post has received over 14,000 likes, with messages of support from those within the community,

43:45.280 --> 43:50.380
however, she has heavily filtered the comments, which means it's hard to discern a consensus on the post.

43:50.380 --> 43:57.580
Conversely, the Sheriff's Office's statement is open to all, leading some to express their disappointment and frustration at the lack of further action

43:57.580 --> 44:04.380
in the comment section, with some stating that in spite of the office's supposedly in-depth report, key details have been overlooked,

44:04.380 --> 44:09.380
which may implicate the Stauffers even more than they had been previously. Let's discuss that.

44:20.580 --> 44:26.980
Now, anyone should be able to request an incident review from the Sheriff's Office, which I did and subsequently received.

44:26.980 --> 44:31.980
There are multiple redactions for obvious reasons, and these can sometimes affect the sentence flow,

44:31.980 --> 44:34.980
but I'll do my best to relay the information back regardless.

44:34.980 --> 44:41.980
Before we go into the more contentious details, I think it's worth noting that the report found that the son had assimilated well into his new family,

44:41.980 --> 44:46.380
and when monitoring his current health appeared to be in a happy and supportive environment,

44:46.380 --> 44:50.980
which I hope we can all rejoice over, regardless of your opinion on the former parents.

44:50.980 --> 44:54.980
Speaking of whom, we're at the centre of this very curious case.

44:55.980 --> 45:01.980
It's crazy how you can grow so much in such a little amount of time. I'm definitely not who I was when we first started YouTube.

45:01.980 --> 45:07.980
As expected, the report was unable to tell anyone too much about the adoption process other than it was legal,

45:07.980 --> 45:11.980
and that the new family had received sufficient background checks, which was fine.

45:11.980 --> 45:16.980
I don't think there's too much that people need to know there. There were minor disputes such as Micah's reference to fundraising,

45:16.980 --> 45:22.980
where she discusses the GoFundMe, but not other methods such as the 1000 piece puzzle of their son,

45:22.980 --> 45:26.980
so I'm sure if that was brought up she would have an explanation at hand. No.

45:26.980 --> 45:31.980
What was more interesting were the explanations pertaining to their decision in dissolving this adoption.

45:31.980 --> 45:36.980
Micah, and perhaps James, I don't know specific names have been redacted in this instance,

45:36.980 --> 45:42.980
framed their now departed son as being physically aggressive towards his other siblings in the household.

45:42.980 --> 45:50.980
They state that they had multiple carers quit on them due to his behaviour, and eventually had to hire a full-time employee just to keep their children safe,

45:50.980 --> 45:54.980
which was very costly. They said multiple family members couldn't handle him,

45:54.980 --> 46:00.980
and there have been numerous evaluations supporting the position that the son's place in the household was no longer tenable.

46:00.980 --> 46:04.980
They also state they have video footage to support their comments with regards to his behaviour.

46:04.980 --> 46:10.980
They state that although their biological offspring are now safe, one son will be needing therapy for what he endured,

46:10.980 --> 46:15.980
and another daughter commented about how she now feels safer without their adopted son under their roof.

46:15.980 --> 46:21.980
It appears that safety and cost were the two issues at the heart of this matter, and you can't often have one without the other.

46:21.980 --> 46:28.980
Another specific instance of these two themes surfacing was the thumb incident, you know the clip where he had duct tape around his hand.

46:28.980 --> 46:36.980
Well, Micah had an explanation for that as well, it appears that Charles was compulsively sucking his thumb to the point where he would start to develop blisters.

46:36.980 --> 46:42.980
His therapist had recommended a thumb guard, however, he ripped off the one he had initially been provided with,

46:42.980 --> 46:49.980
and Micah, in what she admits was a bad judgement call, instead of replacing it, decides to go full DIY and use duct tape to keep it on,

46:49.980 --> 46:54.980
though she does stress this was a one-off. Thank god for that.

46:54.980 --> 46:57.980
There are still some unanswered questions though.

46:57.980 --> 47:02.980
We just pop it out of his mouth and kind of distract him, but his is a little bit different for comfort.

47:02.980 --> 47:04.980
A little bit different. It makes him happy.

47:04.980 --> 47:05.980
And the thumb guard never worked.

47:05.980 --> 47:07.980
Yeah, thumb guard never worked.

47:07.980 --> 47:08.980
Because he was so smart.

47:08.980 --> 47:10.980
He was either really mad or he pulled it off.

47:10.980 --> 47:12.980
No, he always figured out how to pull it off.

47:12.980 --> 47:14.980
Pulled it off, but usually he was very mad before that.

47:14.980 --> 47:16.980
If he didn't figure it out right away.

47:16.980 --> 47:25.980
Yeah, so it was just one of those things where it was just, let it go, get him talking first and kind of work with him, and let him have that comfort for a little while.

47:25.980 --> 47:33.980
Many people with experience in this era don't dispute the possibility that the reported behaviour from the child in question was present,

47:33.980 --> 47:35.980
particularly one who was on the spectrum.

47:35.980 --> 47:41.980
However, people did take issue with the framing, which presented the son as an instigator, or an aggressor.

47:41.980 --> 47:46.980
If you keep in mind the youngster was now in another household where he is reported to be completely happy,

47:46.980 --> 47:50.980
some felt there must have been certain conditions that had precipitated his outbursts.

47:50.980 --> 47:55.980
On top of this, many felt there were circumstantial details which didn't appear compatible with the Stauffer's narrative.

47:55.980 --> 47:58.980
For example, the Bali trip that the Stauffers took in January.

47:58.980 --> 48:02.980
This already seemed like a questionable idea given the alleged circumstances by the parents,

48:02.980 --> 48:05.980
but many observed that in the video prior to their departure,

48:05.980 --> 48:10.980
the son appears to be freely roaming the house without causing the panic that the parents had recounted.

48:10.980 --> 48:17.980
Another thing he loves is wrestling on the floor with dad, he will instigate him in the evening to try to get him to wrestle him,

48:17.980 --> 48:23.980
or like roughhouse, which trust me, my other son is obsessed with too, but that is one thing that he loves to do.

48:23.980 --> 48:29.980
On top of this, many argued that the financial reasoning didn't stand up given how the Stauffers purchased a new house,

48:29.980 --> 48:34.980
took multiple holidays, and indulged in luxury items, such as what is alleged to be a Cartier bracelet,

48:34.980 --> 48:37.980
spotted while she was ironically lamenting their son's therapy costs.

48:38.980 --> 48:43.980
Some people also pointed out the Stauffers refusal to share certain records regarding their adopted son with the police,

48:43.980 --> 48:48.980
though I assume in that instance they were acting on the advice of their lawyers, so little can be taken there.

48:48.980 --> 48:56.980
As far as his personality goes, he is the cuddliest, most energetic, funnest, giggly little guy ever.

48:56.980 --> 49:02.980
He is strong willed, he knows exactly what he wants, and I love that about him.

49:02.980 --> 49:08.980
One thing I love about him, no matter who is having the worst day in the world, if he comes and smiles at you,

49:08.980 --> 49:11.980
or giggles, everybody smiles.

49:11.980 --> 49:16.980
In another interview published in September 2019, just after the child had turned 4,

49:16.980 --> 49:21.980
Micro appears to convey the message that as a child he was relatively low maintenance, to quote,

49:21.980 --> 49:26.980
He is a great kid, and his condition doesn't involve that much overall care.

49:26.980 --> 49:32.980
All you need is a big heart, and practice patience every day. It's a different kind of patience.

49:32.980 --> 49:37.980
He does receive 30 hours of ABA, Applied Behaviour Analysis, in-home therapy a week,

49:37.980 --> 49:41.980
and goes to private preschool to help reach his highest potential.

49:41.980 --> 49:48.980
If the adoption was dissolved at latest May, this provides an almost non-existent window of time for the child's behaviour

49:48.980 --> 49:53.980
to regress in the way that Micro claimed it did, particularly without any clear stimulus at all.

49:53.980 --> 49:59.980
Many brought attention to the numerous changes that the son had endured, including moving house, school enrolment,

49:59.980 --> 50:05.980
vacations, all that may provoke an adverse response from someone on the spectrum, yet didn't seem to.

50:05.980 --> 50:09.980
First time ever in Florida.

50:09.980 --> 50:10.980
He's probably living the dream.

50:10.980 --> 50:14.980
There are a lot of people who are understandably frustrated at the police's conclusion,

50:14.980 --> 50:17.980
but I can't say I'm surprised that no further action was taken.

50:17.980 --> 50:22.980
Although there are very legitimate qualms with certain decisions made by the family which we'll discuss soon,

50:22.980 --> 50:28.980
I couldn't see a state prosecutor taking the case as it was, especially as law enforcement seemed to perceive it.

50:28.980 --> 50:34.980
If you assumed the courts would err on the side of caution, then a lot of it would be defended as misdirected attempts

50:34.980 --> 50:40.980
to establish authority, or as under pressure rash decision making, rather than a pattern of malicious misdeeds.

50:40.980 --> 50:45.980
I'm not entirely sure a court case would have really settled any outstanding gripes either.

50:45.980 --> 50:51.980
The Stauffers are still parents to four children, and although that shouldn't affect legal liability logically speaking,

50:51.980 --> 50:58.980
I think an extended legal procedure may just place further stress on the remaining children, and I don't think anyone really wants that.

50:58.980 --> 51:04.980
You may even have to involve a child who everyone seems so concerned about, it all seems a bit too much trouble.

51:04.980 --> 51:09.980
In spite of this, I understand that the inconsistencies probably leave people rather dissatisfied,

51:09.980 --> 51:14.980
and although you can accept that there are details which we will never know, and we don't have to know,

51:14.980 --> 51:19.980
I think it'd be nice to arbitrate some truth from an ordeal filled with so many conflicting messages.

51:19.980 --> 51:25.980
I don't know about you guys, but it's just like the craziest thing, like every day it starts to hit me, like he's my real son.

51:25.980 --> 51:31.980
Like, he had a foster mom, and he had a real mom at one time, and they were amazing parts of his life,

51:31.980 --> 51:35.980
but it's so crazy to think that like, I'm his only real, like, I'm his mom.

51:35.980 --> 51:40.980
Micah's detractors frame her as self-interested, self-serving, and self-gratifying,

51:40.980 --> 51:45.980
using an adoptee to further her own online image and fuel a white savior complex,

51:45.980 --> 51:52.980
whereas those more sympathetic may see her as a victim of her own romanticist perceptions of what adopting a child would ensue,

51:52.980 --> 51:58.980
trying to withstand the inevitable failure. Was this a mother who adopted a son for the purpose of profit,

51:58.980 --> 52:03.980
or was she just an idealist in way over her head, consumerist or fantasist?

52:03.980 --> 52:06.980
Well, let's take one more look.

52:16.980 --> 52:20.980
Micah Stauffer made a series of awful decisions, there is little debate over that.

52:20.980 --> 52:25.980
She should have listened to expert advice all those years ago, when they told her that this was not a good idea,

52:25.980 --> 52:33.980
yet she didn't. So here we are today, regardless of the truth surrounding their son, as adults, they ultimately bear that responsibility.

52:34.980 --> 52:41.980
Like, I remember, like, praying to God, saying like, I trusted you so much, and like, you gave me a little bit more than I,

52:41.980 --> 52:45.980
than I knew what to do with, and I just wish he could be able to overcome this.

52:45.980 --> 52:48.980
And we love our son so much, like, we want the best for him.

52:48.980 --> 52:59.980
And I'm not saying autism is sad or a bad diagnosis, but just like, everything, like, kind of just compounded down together, and it was hard.

52:59.980 --> 53:04.980
There's no degree of preparation that you can possibly perform which will guarantee a pitfall-free adoption,

53:04.980 --> 53:09.980
particularly when dealing with systems which may not be subject to the same scrutiny that you find at home.

53:09.980 --> 53:14.980
The Stauffers had multiple opportunities to stop and pay attention to the advice that they had been given,

53:14.980 --> 53:20.980
to actually carefully evaluate the condition of their son, and act accordingly. In my opinion, they did not.

53:20.980 --> 53:25.980
But all I want to say is, I'm bonding with my kid. I'm doing what I'm doing.

53:25.980 --> 53:32.980
We put our lives on social media, and I'm not gonna have people sit there and treat me like a fool because I'm not gonna take it.

53:32.980 --> 53:35.980
I'm not the kind of person that just takes stuff, and that's fine.

53:35.980 --> 53:40.980
Mike Stauffer's channel committed to presenting a profile of this mother who is ready to make a difference,

53:40.980 --> 53:45.980
who believed that as long as you dig deep, there is nothing that cannot be achieved.

53:45.980 --> 53:51.980
This may be true to an extent, but sometimes digging deep means more than just what you see on inspirational TV dramas.

53:51.980 --> 53:57.980
It means education, it means analysis, it can even mean changing your own life to accommodate another,

53:57.980 --> 54:01.980
and there was clearly too much Micah had established previously that she was not ready to give up.

54:01.980 --> 54:07.980
Micah wanted to introduce her son to the Stauffer life, but that's not a membership everyone is cut out for,

54:07.980 --> 54:14.980
yet in spite of this, the channel's uploads appeared to portray their new son as coping with the sometimes chaotic lifestyle very aptly,

54:14.980 --> 54:17.980
even if this sometimes meant unhealthy coping mechanisms.

54:17.980 --> 54:22.980
This was echoed in interviews, where Micah regularly emphasised that in spite of the challenges,

54:22.980 --> 54:27.980
the son wasn't excessively disruptive, and Micah had found it to be a rewarding experience in itself.

54:27.980 --> 54:30.980
To audience members, it appears that this gamble had paid off.

54:30.980 --> 54:35.980
Contrast this to the police report, which framed their relationship as under severe strain,

54:35.980 --> 54:40.980
and presenting the son's condition as completely out of control, and portraying him as a ruffian.

54:40.980 --> 54:42.980
It felt like they were talking about two different children.

54:42.980 --> 54:48.980
With such conflicting messages, many accused the Stauffers of omitting and exaggerating details of their convenience

54:48.980 --> 54:51.980
to construct an image which justified their perspective when it suited them.

54:51.980 --> 54:58.980
Most couldn't see this as being a sudden shift, even if you consider the fact that the child's condition had worsened

54:58.980 --> 55:03.980
in such a time period, it would be very out of character for a parent to legitimately give up on a child

55:03.980 --> 55:09.980
who they had nurtured for years on the basis of a few turbulent months, for a condition that they understand and acknowledge.

55:10.980 --> 55:15.980
So this begs the question that many have asked, what happened? Why the inconsistencies?

55:15.980 --> 55:17.980
Let's talk theory.

55:19.980 --> 55:24.980
The first theory is more sympathetic, though still quite critical. We'll call it the denial theory.

55:24.980 --> 55:28.980
This is the one that Micah appears to appeal to in her Instagram statement.

55:28.980 --> 55:33.980
The denial theory dictates that the challenges with the son in question had actually been more prevalent

55:33.980 --> 55:36.980
than they had been represented as on the channel, and in interviews,

55:36.980 --> 55:40.980
Micah tried to excuse the problems in an attempt to prove those who doubted her wrong,

55:40.980 --> 55:43.980
and to try and show that she was ready for the challenge.

55:43.980 --> 55:47.980
However, she was ill-equipped, and the environment wasn't appropriate for the child,

55:47.980 --> 55:51.980
but she was too set in her ways, and it wasn't until these problems became even more apparent

55:51.980 --> 55:56.980
where she had to swallow her pride, and realise she was not cut out for this job.

55:56.980 --> 56:01.980
This is supported by evidence of Micah's own concessions of existing behavioural issues over the years,

56:01.980 --> 56:04.980
and even private posts which appeared to show that there were basic elements

56:04.980 --> 56:07.980
that she was struggling to cope with in the past few years.

56:07.980 --> 56:12.980
However, with this in mind, many would argue that these posts also reflect a more cynical theory,

56:12.980 --> 56:16.980
given how one in particular appears to prioritise optics over truth.

56:16.980 --> 56:18.980
So let's talk about the clout theory.

56:18.980 --> 56:23.980
This theory adopts the belief that the Stauffers took in a child with the intent to profit off their plight.

56:23.980 --> 56:28.980
Adopting children from abroad was already shown to amplify traffic and bolster channels,

56:28.980 --> 56:33.980
and Micah, well known for appealing to her subscriber base, sought to capitalise on this trend.

56:33.980 --> 56:38.980
She would subsequently publicise and monetise all content relating to his adoption and home life,

56:38.980 --> 56:41.980
with the motivation of pandering to people's optimistic nature,

56:41.980 --> 56:45.980
and the romanticised notions they held about adopting children.

56:45.980 --> 56:48.980
However, over time, the cost of maintaining this brand was exceeding the profit,

56:48.980 --> 56:52.980
and as the returns dwindled, and their child remained financially demanding,

56:52.980 --> 56:57.980
the parents decided that his presence was no longer advantageous, and decided to end this journey.

56:57.980 --> 57:00.980
This is obviously supported by some of the evidence that we have already discussed,

57:00.980 --> 57:03.980
which demonstrate a clear consciousness of one's public image,

57:03.980 --> 57:07.980
but also a lot of behavioural patterns that seem to be present in their content,

57:07.980 --> 57:10.980
most accentuated by their shockingly bad announcement video,

57:10.980 --> 57:14.980
which appeared to be focused around preserving people's perception of themselves once more.

57:14.980 --> 57:18.980
The police report didn't flatter Micah either, with the confession that the duct tape incident

57:18.980 --> 57:22.980
occurred all because she wasn't prepared to spend a couple hundred more quid on a new one.

57:22.980 --> 57:26.980
On the other hand, given the cost of adoption, and the subsequent complications,

57:26.980 --> 57:30.980
it seems like a pretty hefty investment to sink in, without the guarantee of returns,

57:30.980 --> 57:34.980
and even if the formula had worked on other channels, there was no assurance that it would work here.

57:34.980 --> 57:39.980
On top of this, if they had enough money to sink into an adoption, even with the donations,

57:39.980 --> 57:42.980
it would be a strange pursuit for the sole purpose of wealth.

57:42.980 --> 57:48.980
Would it have really been worth it? There must have been some personal sacrifice, right?

57:48.980 --> 57:52.980
It's hard to look at the situation, and not at least consider that Micah was far too preoccupied

57:52.980 --> 57:56.980
with how people looked at her, to the point where it often felt like she prioritised that

57:56.980 --> 57:59.980
above the wellbeing of those who she purported to care about.

57:59.980 --> 58:03.980
She may have been set in her ways, and in denial to an extent,

58:03.980 --> 58:07.980
I don't doubt there was a degree of ignorance, but it also feels like the conceptual benefits

58:07.980 --> 58:11.980
of having such a child on a YouTube channel corrupted her decision making.

58:11.980 --> 58:16.980
When other people told her it was wise to revive the son with a more appropriate environment,

58:16.980 --> 58:20.980
she turned a blind eye, proudly proclaiming her defiance,

58:20.980 --> 58:24.980
only falling back on expert opinion when it suited her agenda.

58:24.980 --> 58:29.980
Whether that agenda was more cost motivated or family motivated, I do not know.

58:29.980 --> 58:33.980
Micah references both in the report, and both could be seen as plausible reasons,

58:33.980 --> 58:36.980
but I don't think either could fully justify the outcome.

58:36.980 --> 58:42.980
She favoured the pursuit of this vision of a family over the wellbeing of a child who had no say,

58:42.980 --> 58:45.980
and that was inexcusable.

58:46.980 --> 58:52.980
A lot of people have reflected on this situation with the mind that Micah's era was giving up on a child of her own.

58:52.980 --> 58:56.980
However, although the decision may have been the catalyst for her critics,

58:56.980 --> 59:00.980
the greatest mistake that Micah made was adopting a child in the first place.

59:00.980 --> 59:03.980
The police report also disclosed that the adoption was never finalised,

59:03.980 --> 59:05.980
which is an optional process in the US.

59:05.980 --> 59:09.980
This revelation led many to assert that the Stauffers never planned to keep their adopted son.

59:09.980 --> 59:14.980
Although I personally feel this is unlikely given how they hammered in the rhetoric of adoption being forever,

59:14.980 --> 59:17.980
it may show they harboured more reservations than they displayed,

59:17.980 --> 59:22.980
or to be honest, they may not have considered it important, which also may be indicative.

59:22.980 --> 59:26.980
Many people asked if Micah would do the same if it was a biological son,

59:26.980 --> 59:29.980
and the answer is obviously a resounding no.

59:29.980 --> 59:31.980
Well, we hope at least.

59:31.980 --> 59:33.980
This was one of the focal points for public opinion,

59:33.980 --> 59:38.980
this treatment of a child who they welcomed into their family, but similarly gave away.

59:38.980 --> 59:42.980
On principle, the outcome is positive, the child is in a better place now,

59:42.980 --> 59:43.980
there is no doubt about that.

59:43.980 --> 59:46.980
He has a family who are well equipped to deal with his needs,

59:46.980 --> 59:50.980
and the Stauffer family are likely relieved of a challenging relationship as well,

59:50.980 --> 59:53.980
and hopefully have more time to dedicate it to the rest of their children.

59:53.980 --> 59:59.980
However, many can't help but feel displeased by the conclusion because adversity is part of parenting,

59:59.980 --> 01:00:02.980
and that means stepping up to the challenge, not running from it,

01:00:02.980 --> 01:00:06.980
so although dissolving the adoption may have been the right decision under the circumstances,

01:00:06.980 --> 01:00:11.980
it seemed to be an outcome only precipitated by the parents incompetence.

01:00:12.980 --> 01:00:15.980
It is hard, it is not easier with each kid, it does not feel the same,

01:00:15.980 --> 01:00:20.980
it feels harder with every single child I've had, every time it's harder,

01:00:20.980 --> 01:00:23.980
because different kids have different emotional needs,

01:00:23.980 --> 01:00:27.980
and different kids have different needs, and different kids want different things.

01:00:27.980 --> 01:00:30.980
As mentioned, adoption is no facile enterprise,

01:00:30.980 --> 01:00:34.980
when many adopt, it's with the commitment that it is the creation of an inseparable bond

01:00:34.980 --> 01:00:37.980
which will withstand the challenges that such an adventure may throw at you.

01:00:37.980 --> 01:00:42.980
When you bring a child into your family, people expect you to treat them like your own biological offspring,

01:00:42.980 --> 01:00:44.980
after all, they are no less human.

01:00:44.980 --> 01:00:48.980
In a way, Micah did, but she applied the blueprint store for formula

01:00:48.980 --> 01:00:51.980
which in her mind had worked with her other children.

01:00:51.980 --> 01:00:54.980
When it worked with their son, it worked, it was great,

01:00:54.980 --> 01:00:57.980
when it didn't, well, he clearly just had some learning to do.

01:01:02.980 --> 01:01:05.980
There is never a one-size-fits-all approach when it comes to parenting,

01:01:05.980 --> 01:01:08.980
and although Micah professed to have understood this eventually,

01:01:08.980 --> 01:01:10.980
this wasn't reflected enough in her actions.

01:01:10.980 --> 01:01:14.980
For example, in the police report, Micah remarks that the son would regularly react poorly

01:01:14.980 --> 01:01:19.980
when his siblings were overwhelming him, retreating to the closet and rocking himself non-stop.

01:01:19.980 --> 01:01:22.980
Yet, Micah still made the decision to have another child,

01:01:22.980 --> 01:01:25.980
which they gave birth to around mid-2019,

01:01:25.980 --> 01:01:30.980
which would mean a high-maintenance infant around the house likely further contributing

01:01:30.980 --> 01:01:32.980
to a stressful environment for their son.

01:01:32.980 --> 01:01:37.980
It's these successive poor decisions that could easily aggravate a condition,

01:01:37.980 --> 01:01:41.980
and to many onlookers, it just felt like they were playing Russian Roulette with his triggers.

01:01:41.980 --> 01:01:46.980
Pure theory here, but maybe that's why they took the infant abroad

01:01:46.980 --> 01:01:49.980
to remove that negative stimulus from the son's life.

01:01:49.980 --> 01:01:53.980
Micah's daughter should not have adopted, not just for that reason,

01:01:53.980 --> 01:01:54.980
but for a multitude of others.

01:01:54.980 --> 01:01:57.980
They were not ready for what the child's diagnosis meant,

01:01:57.980 --> 01:02:00.980
and with the information that the child's disposition was not suspected,

01:02:00.980 --> 01:02:03.980
they should have thought much harder than they did.

01:02:03.980 --> 01:02:07.980
Adoption is not going to plan, and coming to an end isn't an immensely rare eventuality.

01:02:07.980 --> 01:02:11.980
It happens in a minority but substantial percentage of adoptions,

01:02:11.980 --> 01:02:16.980
and I'm sure that many people involved in those have not acted with reckless or selfish will.

01:02:16.980 --> 01:02:18.980
Sometimes these things don't work out,

01:02:18.980 --> 01:02:22.980
so I don't want to attack everyone who has ever had to give up an adopted child.

01:02:22.980 --> 01:02:28.980
But the Stauffers had a window to act and retain their dignity, and that window passed.

01:02:28.980 --> 01:02:33.980
Guys, I have to say, you like the fast cars, don't you?

01:02:33.980 --> 01:02:37.980
I think he's definitely my son, aren't you?

01:02:37.980 --> 01:02:38.980
Are you my boy?

01:02:38.980 --> 01:02:41.980
Yeah, you like fast cars too, like Rad?

01:02:41.980 --> 01:02:43.980
It's so cool, guys.

01:02:43.980 --> 01:02:47.980
Put the finances aside, put the channel aside, this was for the child,

01:02:47.980 --> 01:02:50.980
and his position on such a family channel was already debatable,

01:02:50.980 --> 01:02:53.980
but the revelation that he was suffering from an affliction

01:02:53.980 --> 01:02:58.980
which directly inhibited his ability to communicate should have been cause for serious rumination.

01:02:58.980 --> 01:03:02.980
At that point, with the advice of experts, Micah should have made decision

01:03:02.980 --> 01:03:07.980
whether to find a more appropriate home for the son or prepare herself to make significant changes to her own life.

01:03:07.980 --> 01:03:11.980
She chose the third option, which was to press on with the predetermined plans,

01:03:11.980 --> 01:03:17.980
and upping the dosage on the sappy, sentimental, spiritual language of how it was just meant to be.

01:03:17.980 --> 01:03:24.980
He's been home for, like I said, almost two years, and I don't know what I would do without him.

01:03:24.980 --> 01:03:28.980
We have hard days. We do. Not every day is easy.

01:03:28.980 --> 01:03:35.980
When you have a kiddo that has so many wants and desires and wants to be heard all the time and is strong-willed,

01:03:35.980 --> 01:03:40.980
you have communication struggles, and some days are just hard.

01:03:40.980 --> 01:03:45.980
One thing that's changed this year more than ever is I feel like our connection as a family

01:03:45.980 --> 01:03:49.980
has gotten so profoundly amazing.

01:03:49.980 --> 01:03:53.980
It is easily one of my favourite people in the entire world.

01:03:53.980 --> 01:03:58.980
Micah and James Dorfer will have to live with the ramifications of the decisions they made,

01:03:58.980 --> 01:04:00.980
even if that only extends to social media.

01:04:00.980 --> 01:04:04.980
With everything in mind, it's hard to really see how Micah will relaunch her channel.

01:04:04.980 --> 01:04:08.980
It has remained dormant since the situation, and maybe that's for the best.

01:04:08.980 --> 01:04:11.980
James' channel remains active and still attracts significant viewership.

01:04:11.980 --> 01:04:17.980
Whether he will continue to be the sole uploader for the family bread is another question that only time will answer.

01:04:17.980 --> 01:04:22.980
I'll make this clear, I don't necessarily disagree with showing childhood mental struggles in video form.

01:04:22.980 --> 01:04:27.980
Particularly for educational purposes, there is a lot that one can learn from such a portrayal,

01:04:27.980 --> 01:04:33.980
but at the same time, it needs to be presented fairly and impartially with respect to the child at the centre of the spectacle,

01:04:33.980 --> 01:04:36.980
and that's an aspect that a lot of family channels fall short on,

01:04:36.980 --> 01:04:42.980
because too often, they're more concerned with catering to an image rather than presenting a faithful portrait,

01:04:42.980 --> 01:04:46.980
based on the trials and tribulations that a family under such stress would have to confront.

01:04:46.980 --> 01:04:52.980
Many asked if Micah would have treated a biological son the same way that she treated her adopted son.

01:04:52.980 --> 01:04:57.980
It's an easy and mostly rhetorical question that does provoke some good discourse at least.

01:04:57.980 --> 01:05:00.980
However, for me, there was a more interesting question.

01:05:00.980 --> 01:05:03.980
Would she have done this at all if she didn't have a YouTube channel?

01:05:03.980 --> 01:05:11.980
And if no, is it okay for an individual to have such a consequential decision riding on the existence of that platform?

01:05:11.980 --> 01:05:15.980
YouTube influences the creative liberties we take, the decisions we make.

01:05:15.980 --> 01:05:21.980
That is beyond doubt, but where is the line? Where does YouTube end and real life begin?

01:05:21.980 --> 01:05:23.980
These are the questions that I'll leave with you today.

01:05:23.980 --> 01:05:27.980
I hope they are thought-provoking enough, even if they are a little simple.

01:05:27.980 --> 01:05:34.980
You have a favorite failure, and how has maybe a failure in your life set you up for future success?

01:05:34.980 --> 01:05:42.980
So I wouldn't call it a failure, but I would call it something that was really, really, really, really, really challenging.

01:05:42.980 --> 01:05:46.980
We recently adopted a little guy from China. Definitely not a failure.

01:05:46.980 --> 01:05:52.980
But when we adopted him, he had a totally different diagnosis than what we were told.

01:05:52.980 --> 01:05:58.980
We were told that he had a brain tumor, and as a cancer nurse, I was comfortable with that moving forward.

01:05:58.980 --> 01:06:07.980
And he actually had severe brain damage, severe autism, and some severe delays that may mean that he may live with me for the rest of his life.

01:06:07.980 --> 01:06:09.980
Something that we just literally were not ready for.

01:06:09.980 --> 01:06:15.980
A lot of people believe that Micah is a narcissist, and although it's not a discussion that I'm going to have right now,

01:06:15.980 --> 01:06:16.980
I can't blame them.

01:06:16.980 --> 01:06:20.980
She'd welcome these interviews, which keep at probation onto her as this selfless Samaritan,

01:06:20.980 --> 01:06:24.980
embracing this image bestowed onto her through this adoption journey.

01:06:24.980 --> 01:06:27.980
Yet when the tables turned, the best she could do was this.

01:06:27.980 --> 01:06:31.980
Do I feel like a failure as a mom? Like, 500%.

01:06:31.980 --> 01:06:35.980
You get no points for stating the obvious here. Micah had failed.

01:06:35.980 --> 01:06:39.980
Not for letting her son leave, but for the way the son was treated while he was there.

01:06:39.980 --> 01:06:44.980
The audience deserved better, the children deserved better, he deserved better.

01:06:44.980 --> 01:06:48.980
Family channels represent an immovable demographic on the YouTube platform.

01:06:48.980 --> 01:06:51.980
The influence they have in shaping people's lives is undeniable.

01:06:51.980 --> 01:06:55.980
But before you put them behind a camera, make sure you put them first.

01:06:55.980 --> 01:07:00.980
And if you preach the principles of loyalty and commitment, then expect to be held to those standards.

01:07:00.980 --> 01:07:04.980
And don't be surprised if people are angry if you failed to practice that commitment yourself.

01:07:04.980 --> 01:07:09.980
Are you constructing a YouTube channel around a family, or a family around a YouTube channel?

01:07:09.980 --> 01:07:12.980
Maybe that question should have been asked to Micah.

01:07:12.980 --> 01:07:20.980
When I started the adoption process, I never really found very much material on what it was like when you get home.

01:07:20.980 --> 01:07:25.980
And I think that this could be a really cool resource for somebody who's gone through the journey.

01:07:25.980 --> 01:07:31.980
But once you get home, and once you kind of find that perfect niche for your family, it's amazing.

01:07:31.980 --> 01:07:33.980
It is absolutely amazing.

01:07:33.980 --> 01:07:37.980
Be aware, and make sure you are capable of the challenges you are facing up to.

01:07:37.980 --> 01:07:42.980
And if you do make a mistake, for Christ's sake, don't make a terrible video about it.

01:07:42.980 --> 01:07:48.980
99, 95% of the struggles we have never publicly aired, ever.

01:07:48.980 --> 01:07:51.980
What were they thinking?

01:08:07.980 --> 01:08:32.980
So yes guys, that was the video.

01:08:32.980 --> 01:08:35.980
I hope you enjoyed, I hope you had a good time.

01:08:35.980 --> 01:08:37.980
I'm sure I did, I had a great time.

01:08:47.980 --> 01:08:50.980
God, I can't contain my enthusiasm.

01:08:50.980 --> 01:08:57.980
Anyhow, I want to give a big thanks, extend my gratitude to the fantastic editors for the work they did.

01:08:57.980 --> 01:08:59.980
Brilliant work, as always, I'm sure.

01:08:59.980 --> 01:09:03.980
Go check them out, they'll be in the pinned comment, there are links.

01:09:03.980 --> 01:09:09.980
Also want to give a big thanks to my patrons, $10 patreons up on there right now.

01:09:14.980 --> 01:09:24.980
And a special thanks to my $50 patrons, Samhala Baloo, Caroline, Hypercube Amanda Devon, and Shiro Chigo.

01:09:24.980 --> 01:09:31.980
I also want to extend a special thanks to my $100 patrons, Christopher Karas, and Ileana Banana.

01:09:31.980 --> 01:09:33.980
Great name, I love that one, I love that one.

01:09:33.980 --> 01:09:40.980
And another $100 patreon, PokeySirenYT, who has asked for a custom message, which is the first time.

01:09:40.980 --> 01:09:46.980
This has been exercised, but I will happily honor it, and he wants to tell you to go and check out his YouTube channel

01:09:46.980 --> 01:09:48.980
and provide some constructive criticism.

01:09:48.980 --> 01:09:54.980
What a lovely, lovely individual. I will leave it alongside his patreon credit in the pinned comment.

01:09:54.980 --> 01:09:59.980
Anyhow, my social medias will also be in the pinned comment, I've been particularly active recently,

01:09:59.980 --> 01:10:03.980
but maybe I'll be more active by the time this video is out, who knows.

01:10:03.980 --> 01:10:09.980
Otherwise, I don't really have too much else to add, so I hope by the time this is out, we're all a bit more free.

01:10:09.980 --> 01:10:17.980
It feels right now that even though it's beginning to ease, the tension remains,

01:10:17.980 --> 01:10:21.980
and I hope that is all lifted off our shoulders soon enough.

01:10:21.980 --> 01:10:29.980
Same I love to you guys, but until then, I'm the right pinion, and I will see you in the next one.

01:10:51.980 --> 01:10:53.980
Thanks for watching!
