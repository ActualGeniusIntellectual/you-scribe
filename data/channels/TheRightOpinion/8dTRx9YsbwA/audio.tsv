0	5560	Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, there was a family.
5560	8920	"- I got you a banana too!
8920	11600	Okay, I don't want to do this."
11600	16620	But this wasn't just any family, this was a vlogging family.
16620	20220	"- Good morning, guys. Today, we're going to do a day in the life weekend style."
20220	24520	At the center of the household, a loving mother by the name of Micah.
24520	29580	"- It's going to be perfectly clean. I want it to smell like baked goods with flowers and candles lit.
29580	32080	I just want it to be like the perfect hot fall evening."
32080	34080	Micah Stauffer.
34080	36580	She was the loving mother of five children.
36580	40580	Jacob, Kova, Bradley, and Onyx.
40580	42580	Hang on a minute.
42580	45580	One, two, three.
45580	47580	I only named four.
47580	52580	"- Yeah. Oh, baby.
52580	55580	I love you so much. You're my buddy."
55580	58080	Ah, that's right.
58080	60580	We don't do the happily ever afters here.
60580	64080	Hello, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion.
69680	74880	Family. For better and for worse, there is no connection like the one you create with the family.
74880	76680	I've discussed this time and time again,
76680	80780	so I shan't go into too much depth on my philosophical thoughts on one's kin's folk.
80780	85280	But as you're aware by this point, emotional potential breeds market potential,
85280	89280	and the family channel took its place on the YouTube terrain a long time ago.
89280	92180	Now, family channels are no stranger to criticism.
92180	97880	The extent that some families will go for views often places some of the channels at odds with the rather rigorous standards
97880	100580	that audience members impose on such creators.
100580	102080	Why do these standards exist?
102080	103580	Well, because of the children.
103580	110080	If you are a parent, many would assert that you have a responsibility to preserve as idyllic a childhood as possible for your offspring,
110080	116480	and that degree of responsibility is only amplified when you are uploading content of your family onto a public platform.
116480	121480	In spite of this, most criticism is typically confined to parents failing to be adequate role models,
121480	125880	not just for their own family, but for others who they are supposed to be educating through their content.
125880	131380	Some of these escapades may lead to others asking if these families are equipped properly to even have children.
131380	137280	However, it is certainly parents who are asking that question themselves or even acting on such an inclination.
137280	140280	This is where today's subjects appear to be an exception.
145980	149280	As the introduction preface, this is Micah Stauffer.
149280	153680	She's a family vlogger who has been sharing her life with us since 2014.
153680	158180	Her husband, James, is a mechanical engineer and runs the channel Stauffer Garage,
158180	162580	where he shares some of the work he does and occasionally reacts to poorly looked after vehicles.
162580	165280	So it appears that such talent runs in the family.
165280	168780	They were wedged shortly after the launch of the channel in July 2014,
168780	171980	revealing their heartwarming success story in the same month.
189780	193980	Micah's oldest child, Kova, was born in 2011 to a different partner.
193980	197280	She was brought forward onto the vlog channel as the resident toddler,
197280	202680	and over the following years, Micah built a family alongside her YouTube channel, sharing each step of the way.
202680	208380	Two more children were born in this time, Jayka and Radley, with each pregnancy being documented fairly extensively.
208380	213480	13 weeks, 14 weeks, 15 weeks, 16 weeks, 17 weeks, you get what I'm saying.
213480	217980	She'd also promote postnatal well-being, in particular weight loss, a lot of weight loss.
217980	221280	In fact, Micah was proud of her lean physique, self-care,
221280	224680	and wanted to impart that wisdom upon all of her loyal followers.
224680	229480	I don't just want to have a healthy body and not a healthy mind or a clear headspace.
229480	233180	I want to stay positive. I want to be encouraging. I want to be uplifting to you.
233180	238580	Like, that's the reason I started my YouTube channel, is to be a positive space and be an uplifting space
238580	242880	for you to come and get inspired when you're feeling like you're struggling or you're down.
242880	247180	Over time, she gradually cultivated an audience who were engaged in her day-to-day life.
247180	250780	Her views tended to fluctuate a little, but her subscriber base was advancing,
250780	253180	and she appeared satisfied with what she had created.
253180	256380	After all, she was just a small piece of this family puzzle.
256380	258380	I think that's what drew in certain viewers.
258380	262380	Micah had found Elaine, and even though I personally found it a tad repetitive,
262380	264680	rhythm and routine is comforting for many people.
264680	266780	In many ways, Micah did everything right.
266780	271480	She'd married an eligible bachelor, delivered children who were being raised in a supportive climate,
271480	274780	and maintained her own well-being while helping others do the same.
274780	277680	She was really living the American dream.
277680	279180	But was that enough?
279180	281080	Hi guys, and welcome back to my channel.
281080	284880	Today I'm going to be sharing with you 15 baby names that I absolutely love,
284880	286880	and one baby name that I'm going to be using.
286880	291480	You see, in spite of her accustomed comfort zone, Micah always had a wild side,
291480	295380	an edge to her, which may not necessarily correlate with the rest of her image.
295380	299380	She aspired for something more in her role as a mother, and perhaps as a creator,
299380	305180	and she couldn't just direct all that energy into quirky names like Camden, Remington,
305180	307780	Niega, and Abecorn.
307780	309480	Yes, Abecorn.
309480	310580	No judgment, of course.
310580	314380	If there are any Abecorns in the comments, be sure to make your presence known.
314380	316080	I'm not invalidating you.
316080	318780	However, there was one name that stood out from the rest.
318780	322480	For the 12th name that I really like is Huxley.
322480	325280	I think this is a really edgy, super modern name.
325280	330280	Yes, Micah was a super modern renegade who had a vision for what her family could be.
330280	334980	And after three children, she was ready to venture from the security of a suburban white bread world.
334980	341180	And on the 6th of July 2016, our Mrs. Stauffer made the announcement that would change her life forever.
341180	343180	Hi guys, and welcome back to my channel.
343180	348480	Today, Jim and I have a very big surprise and secret that we want to share with you guys.
348480	351680	But maybe Dorothy should have stayed in Kansas.
351680	356180	You'll have to find out after we've spoken about rage.
356180	358180	Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
358180	359680	Excuse me, I would like to finish the ad, please.
359680	360980	They're not paying me this time.
360980	362480	The people deserve to know.
362480	364280	Oh, Jesus Christ, out!
364280	366480	It's about my sheer love for the game.
366480	367880	Out, go, leave.
367880	369280	Okay, okay, I'll go.
371280	372780	Tro, where's the door handle?
372780	373280	Wait.
384780	387280	Come on, Tro, you haven't fed us in two days.
387280	388780	I don't see what the fuss is about.
388780	391480	The answers haven't eaten in weeks and they've never been better.
394280	395780	Please just just let us go.
395780	396980	We'll do anything.
396980	398180	Anything, eh?
398180	400480	Well, I suppose I can offer you a way out.
400480	401880	What? Tell us!
401880	405680	All you have to do is listen to this one message.
405680	410580	Raycons are the new hottest thing for your ear since I dropped my latest mixtape,
410580	412680	Hot Wraps and Top Hats.
412680	416980	It was founded by Ray J, our upstanding citizen of the century,
416980	420580	who has also dabbled in hip hop, though not quite to my ability.
420580	423880	But there's a reason for that, because he has been behind the scenes,
423880	429680	crafting some of the most cutting edge premium earbuds this universe has ever witnessed.
429680	431480	I mean, look at this.
431480	434980	They just go in your ear, wireless, like that.
434980	437280	And if they don't, multiple fits.
437280	441080	As life has always taught me, you got to be prepared for any size.
441080	445880	They even come in this nice rechargeable case, which give your earbuds newfound power.
445880	447780	It's like some sort of magic.
447780	450380	Ray J is basically a sorcerer.
450380	452880	The Harry Potter of premium earbuds.
452880	456480	When I put them in, I feel like a different person.
456480	457980	Wait, that is a different person.
457980	459980	Give my earbuds back, you prick!
459980	465280	There are so many colours, from blue, to red, to black, to red, to blue.
465280	466680	My favourite is red.
466680	469080	It matches with the blood of my enemies.
469080	472280	And it's not just me that is going ballistic.
472280	473180	Insane.
473180	479580	Snoop Dogg, Mike Tyson, and Rich the Kid are all losing their minds over this brand.
479580	483380	Full grown adults, obsessing this is madness.
483380	487280	Well, apart from Rich, I suppose, though, he does look quite mature for a child.
487280	489680	Raycons basically do anything.
489680	494180	Well, they won't cook you dinner, but you can listen to them while you cook your dinner.
494180	495780	Just don't leave that oven on.
495780	497580	Crap.
497580	498980	There goes the house.
498980	500180	Third one this month.
500180	504980	But just put on your talking heads, and you have some real ambience.
504980	506280	To perfect that ambience,
506280	509080	be sure to use the everyday E25s.
509080	513780	Six hours of play, Bluetooth pairing, a more compact design.
513780	516580	Ray J, the absolute madman.
516580	519180	Why? Why did you do that, Ray J?
519180	521980	That model also has some decent reviews as well.
521980	522780	So there's that.
522780	528480	And now Ray is telling me he wants a big, huge, massive gargantuan 15% off
528480	530880	if you click the link in the description below.
530880	533580	By Raycon.com forward slash tro.
533580	536880	That's by Raycon.com forward slash tro.
536880	538680	Bish bash bosh.
538680	542980	Now I know why everybody loves Raymond.
542980	547280	Well, I did say it was a way out.
547280	549080	Now back to the video.
555080	559880	There has been something that we have been hiding for about a month now.
559880	565180	And we're really just so blessed and so excited to share with you guys.
565180	570680	Jim and I have decided that we are going to adopt from China.
570680	574280	We're going to be adopting a little boy from China.
574280	577480	We haven't officially formally started the process yet.
577480	582080	And we do plan on taking y'all with us through the journey and all of the steps along the way.
582080	583280	Yes, it was in this video.
583280	587880	The couple announced their intentions to adopt with the name being decided shortly after.
587880	590080	As some of you may be intending to look it up,
590080	593880	this was the one mentioned earlier in the naming video, not Abercorn, I'll add,
593880	595980	but I shan't be mentioning the name further.
595980	598180	The Stauffers seemed optimistic about their choice,
598180	601280	and in the coming year traveled to China to find their new son.
601280	603580	This adoption was in part supported by GoFundMe,
603580	607980	which was meant to contribute to the costly process that such a task can give rise to.
607980	609880	Adoption is no easy venture.
609880	612280	It shouldn't be like window shopping for a new child.
612280	613280	Even at a young age,
613280	618080	many orphans face acute developmental challenges brought on by the often turbulent environments
618080	620680	and lack of secure attachment figures that come with it.
620680	621380	With this in mind,
621380	624680	there is a lot of respect for those who choose to undertake such an endeavor
624680	627880	and provide a child with the joyful youth that they deserve.
627880	629680	However, they must also be well prepared,
629680	633880	and most of Micah's preparation appeared to amount to reading inspirational quotes.
633880	635680	Like I said, more than anything,
635680	636880	this is our boy,
636880	641880	and we don't need to consult with any more physicians until I bring this little guy home.
642680	643480	He's our son,
643480	644880	and that's that.
644880	646880	He's not going to treat him.
646880	648180	We're not going to return him.
648580	649280	He's our boy.
649980	651780	Now, I just to an extent,
651780	655880	I cannot say exactly what happened behind the scenes when it came to Micah's planning.
655880	660680	However, the way she presented it on her channel may raise a few questions in hindsight.
660980	666180	We sent off our imaging to our physician that's kind of been on board with.
666880	668180	She's been reviewing the files.
668180	670980	She's been very optimistic about this little boy.
670980	673080	She's like, I don't see anything wrong with him.
673080	674880	He looks perfect to me.
675280	676780	And then when she got the imaging,
676780	680180	her optimism went down significantly.
680580	683980	She, and it's nothing against this physician.
683980	686880	You know, she's just listening to what other doctors,
686880	692480	other neurosurgeons and neurodevelopment specialists are telling her.
692780	698280	But her prognosis and everything for our son just went drastic.
698280	705380	She kind of almost discouraged us from adopting him like saying that this is going to be severe.
705380	707180	This is going to be a lot.
707380	712180	There were clearly people around Micah who harbored doubts about the feasibility of the family's ambitions.
712180	713780	Nonetheless, this did not faze them,
713780	715580	and towards the end of 2017,
715580	719180	they uploaded a series of videos which followed them on their adoption journey.
719180	721680	Many of these videos were uploaded onto their second channel,
721680	722680	The Store for Life,
722680	728180	whose presence has been completely expunged from the internet for reasons that we will discuss in due course.
728380	732780	So what we did is we took his CT scans to our second physician
732780	736880	because we had two doctors on board reviewing our son's file.
737280	742280	And that doctor gave us a bet, a much better thought process.
742280	744480	He said, you know what?
745280	747880	What she said could be very well true.
747980	750180	But look at the videos on this little guy.
750180	752480	He is developmentally on track.
752580	753380	He is talking.
753380	754480	He is walking.
754580	755680	He's throwing balls.
755680	756780	He's climbing furniture.
756780	757680	He's acting.
757680	765280	He is walking and talking like a normal one year old and doing things that are beyond his developmental schedule.
765380	771480	So be aware that that little brain may be compensating more than we realize,
771480	774680	and maybe he is just doing just fine.
775080	776580	However, back to China,
776680	781580	all necessary arrangements to ensure a smooth and straightforward adoption have been put in place,
781580	786580	with Micah and her husband traveling out to the adoption clinic where they proceeded to meet prospective candidates
786580	787980	for their nurturing family.
788080	790380	One individual rose above the competition.
790380	793980	Yes, a child that upon encountering Micah just knew was the one,
793980	796380	one that she had a connection with like no other.
796480	801280	And when she felt that, she decided to act on her intuition and finalized this process.
801580	805780	I actually got to see him prior to meeting him.
806080	809180	And when I saw him, I just lost it.
809180	811380	I cried so hard.
811480	812980	My heart couldn't quit beating.
812980	815780	It was just one of those feelings where you just know,
815880	816680	you know,
816680	820780	and it was just the craziest feeling that I've ever felt in my entire life,
820780	821380	which is really,
821380	821980	really cool.
822080	823980	As well as being covered on their second channel,
823980	827580	many of the adoption stages were broadcast on Micah's main account as well,
827680	830280	even receiving its own specialized playlist.
830380	832580	She was clearly very proud of this achievement,
832580	836680	and the video of the adoption day would go on to obtain over five million views.
836680	837380	In these videos,
837380	842380	Micah would present herself as this resolute, uncompromising mother who would never rest on her laurels
842380	845280	or have her commitment to her new son worn down.
845280	846180	If anything,
846280	849480	my child is not returnable.
849680	850080	I,
850080	853180	so when I heard all of the things that that doctor was telling us,
853680	856280	it kind of went in one ear and out the other.
856280	857980	I wasn't in a state of denial.
857980	860880	I accepted and took on everything that she said.
860880	861880	And I sat down with Jim.
861880	862180	I said,
862180	862680	you know,
863380	864780	worst case situation.
865180	867180	If our little boy at one point in his life,
867180	870580	he needs to be in a wheelchair and he needed full on care.
870780	871780	Would you still love him?
871780	872380	And we,
872380	873580	without a doubt in our minds,
873580	874180	we knew.
874580	877080	No matter what state he came to us,
877080	878280	that we would love him.
878780	880280	It's a very stirring sentiment,
880280	883880	and one that would be reiterated over the coming years in YouTube videos,
883880	885080	social media posts,
885080	886480	and even in interviews.
886480	888580	Micah was now not only a health conscious,
888580	889580	hardworking mother,
889580	893280	but she had used her influence to give back to someone much less fortunate.
893280	895980	There was no price that you could put on such an opportunity,
895980	899580	and the child always presented the perception that this was mutual gratitude,
899580	901780	because that's the sort of person that Micah was.
901780	903480	Even when she was giving back,
903480	904980	she was learning so much,
904980	907080	and she was ready to learn more.
907680	910780	I can definitely say that I'm a better mom today,
910780	913680	and I can't wait to see the lessons that he teaches me.
913680	914580	Why am I crying?
914980	917680	I can't wait to see some of the lessons that he teaches me.
919580	920780	Many years from now,
920780	924280	but I just want to tell him if he ever watches this,
924880	925480	thank you.
927080	929480	I wouldn't take back any of those hard days,
929880	932180	or any of those moments,
932180	935280	because I've taught me so much,
935280	940180	and I just pray to be an amazing mom to him,
940180	944180	and just take the best care of my family as I humanly possibly can.
944280	947280	However, some lessons are harder than others.
947680	948080	You see,
948080	950880	their new son was a greater challenge than one had anticipated,
950880	951980	because according to Micah,
951980	955680	the Chinese adoption center's experts had misdiagnosed him.
955680	956180	In fact,
956180	957380	in an interview with The Bump,
957380	961480	Micah stated that the adoption agency had commented that he suffers from a small brain tumor.
961580	964080	This should not have affected his cognitive ability.
964080	964380	However,
964380	966680	they observed behaviors which they couldn't explain,
966680	967680	such as biting,
967680	968280	pinching,
968280	969880	and banging his head against a wall.
970080	974580	The couple observed that he must have been more developmentally challenged than they had initially assumed,
974580	976080	and after multiple consultations,
976080	979780	it was revealed that the child had actually experienced a stroke while in utero,
979780	981880	and this was stifling his mental faculty.
982280	982780	Originally,
982780	985280	it was thought that this setback was only temporary,
985380	988980	and that the Stauffer's new son would easily catch up with his peers over time.
989080	989380	However,
989380	990280	this was not the case,
990280	993680	and after a series of further evaluations through an expensive health system,
993680	996480	the son in question was diagnosed with level three autism.
996480	998980	This is the most serious diagnosis on the spectrum,
999080	1002880	and a person suffering from it will face serious challenges in social interaction.
1002880	1007280	It is also noted that they will require high levels of support to help them manage their condition.
1007680	1009180	In this 2019 article,
1009180	1012980	Micah reflects on the diagnosis and states that after a period of introspection,
1012980	1015080	she realized the problem wasn't with her son,
1015280	1016280	but with herself,
1016280	1017380	and that this affliction,
1017380	1018380	although challenging,
1018380	1020680	only served to illuminate the beauty of life.
1020880	1021580	To quote,
1021780	1024580	He taught me to quit giving a damn what other people think.
1024680	1027080	When people stare at you and judge your parenting skills,
1027080	1031080	you have to learn to let those horrible looks and mean words roll right off your shoulder.
1031280	1033780	Parenting a child with autism looks very different,
1033780	1035680	and people don't know how to perceive that.
1035880	1036580	To be frank,
1036680	1038180	they don't have to understand.
1038380	1041180	All that matters is that we're doing the best for our family.
1041580	1042780	We still have hard days.
1042780	1044880	I still seek guidance and ask for help,
1044880	1046980	and sometimes I still break down in tears.
1047080	1052480	But the one thing I know for sure is that our son doesn't go a day without being endlessly loved.
1052580	1053680	Adoption is love.
1053880	1055080	It takes a lot of grit,
1055280	1055580	sweat,
1055580	1056280	and tears,
1056580	1058280	but it's so worth it in the end.
1058780	1061280	Even if your ending looks different than you had planned,
1061580	1062380	just remember,
1062680	1064680	different isn't a bad thing.
1064980	1066380	This was Micah's philosophy,
1066480	1070180	and one that she continued to advocate for right up to 2020.
1070280	1075080	This year has been so amazing to kind of affirm those questions in my head
1075080	1076380	and let me know that like,
1076880	1078680	I am fighting the right fight.
1078680	1081080	I am doing what is best for my kiddo.
1081380	1085780	There's so many days that I'm just so grateful that I got the opportunity to get to be your mama.
1086380	1086880	And
1087380	1089180	he is my son through and through.
1089180	1090380	He's my baby boy,
1090380	1090980	and I am
1092580	1093980	so glad that
1094580	1096180	he is part of our family.
1096580	1097380	I couldn't
1098380	1100380	I couldn't do my day without him.
1100380	1100980	So,
1101780	1102980	what changed?
1114380	1116180	Micah was a content creator.
1116380	1118180	When she found a formula that people enjoyed,
1118180	1119980	she would deliver it again
1120380	1121180	and again
1121380	1122180	and again.
1122580	1126180	And that truth was no different to the content she released with her adopted son.
1127180	1131380	I'm so grateful, so blessed, and so thankful all at the same time.
1131580	1133980	Just because things are hard doesn't mean they're bad.
1133980	1136180	It just means it takes a lot of work.
1136380	1138580	And one day I'll be so grateful for
1139180	1142980	all the hard work and all the time and all the energy put into our baby.
1142980	1147580	She was an individual who wanted to present herself as the embodiment of the can-do mindset.
1147580	1149780	She may face hurdles, but she was braced for them,
1149780	1153080	and she was ready for the difference that she would make through overcoming them.
1153680	1157480	Many creators, particularly vloggers, present their content as this journey,
1157480	1160680	and we will see them hit a milestone, and it will feel good.
1160880	1162880	It provides the impression of progress.
1162880	1166080	It's what reels in a lot of audiences, and with Micah's son,
1166080	1169880	there was an opportunity to show more than the basic developmental breakthroughs.
1170280	1172880	In the years following the adoption, in spite of the challenges,
1172880	1175880	Micah documented many of these milestones that her son reached.
1175880	1179480	People tuned in for this, providing the mother with a consistent level of growth.
1179480	1182080	However, this was also a troublesome formula.
1182080	1184880	As a blogger, you choose how much of your life is presented.
1184880	1186180	It's a nice privilege.
1186180	1190380	However, at the same time, this presentation also has a bearing on how you are perceived.
1190380	1194380	Micah chose to depict her life in a way that painted the environment as challenging,
1194380	1199180	yet manageable, with the occasional inspirational speech about how she was going to pull through,
1199180	1200980	the sort of person who would never give up.
1200980	1204880	So the worst thing that she could do in any circumstance is to give up.
1204880	1207680	To many, she would not only be betraying her adopted son,
1207680	1211380	but she would be betraying the spirit that she had constantly promoted on her channel,
1211380	1213180	and compromise her own mantra.
1213480	1214780	How could you do that?
1215080	1216980	Well, let's move to the present year.
1217180	1220480	Now, the start of 2020 is where the schedule becomes a bit murky,
1220480	1224180	mainly because no one was particularly concerned with what Micah Stauffer was doing.
1224180	1227780	She continued to upload content about her family, nothing particularly new.
1227780	1230580	However, there was an increasing absence of the son of interest.
1230580	1233880	Micah had given birth to a new child named Onyx the year before,
1233880	1236980	and in January, they took their newborn on a vacation to Bali,
1236980	1239280	implying that the other children had been left at home.
1239280	1244180	The last public statement made regarding his well-being prior to this fateful video was released in February.
1244180	1248880	This post appeared to divulge difficulties regarding coping with their child's temperamental nature.
1248880	1252780	Following that post, the son ceased to make appearances on the family's social media,
1252780	1256980	with both Jim and Micah making comments alluding to adversity in their lives.
1256980	1260580	However, as they were not specific, there was little people could deduce from it.
1260580	1265580	Nonetheless, as time passed, people became increasingly suspicious as to their child's whereabouts,
1265580	1267880	and began to apply pressure onto the couple.
1267880	1272480	Users began to speculate in forums, and in the comment sections of the Stauffer's social media,
1272480	1275080	shedding further light onto the unanswered question.
1275080	1279080	People started constructing hypotheses as to what exactly happened to their young'un,
1279080	1282580	and these rumours were only going to gather momentum if left unaddressed.
1282580	1284480	After all, he is your son.
1284480	1288080	So on the 26th of May, the Stauffers decide to set the record straight,
1288080	1290880	and provide people with an update on their family.
1291280	1297280	So this is by far the hardest video James and I have ever publicly had to make.
1297280	1299480	How do you break bad news?
1299480	1303080	It's a tough one, especially when that news is equally bad news for yourself,
1303080	1306580	and make no mistake, this was an awful scenario for Micah to find herself in.
1306580	1310080	Not only was she going to undermine the tons of rhetoric she had espoused,
1310080	1311680	she had to explain why.
1311680	1316280	This was obviously an upsetting decision for any family to enact,
1316280	1318980	and must have been made with a heavy heart.
1318980	1323380	Therefore, it was understandably a difficult subject for them to speak about.
1323380	1328280	However, at the same time, this decision was clearly one taken with great deliberation,
1328280	1333180	and these Stauffers can take all the time they need to justify it in a way that makes sense.
1333180	1338780	They had ample time to prepare an explanation that was empathetic to people's inevitable objections,
1338780	1341580	but still made sense of the dilemma that they had been placed in.
1342080	1343380	Did they manage that?
1343380	1346780	Well, let's discuss the content of the video first.
1346780	1351580	Micah opens by thanking her amazing viewers for respecting their son's privacy,
1351580	1354480	which apparently helped her through some really hard times,
1354480	1357980	before becoming surprisingly emotional very quickly.
1357980	1365280	...we have some viewers who have been just, like, so incredibly kind and respectful of our son's privacy.
1365280	1370980	I just want to say thank you, like, that really got me through some really hard times,
1370980	1372680	and I just want to say thanks.
1372680	1377780	Like, you have no idea what that means to me,
1377780	1382380	and some of the special messages that you've sent, like, just thank you.
1382380	1383980	Thank you for the moment.
1384680	1390080	James then cuts in, well, he's cut in paying tribute to Micah's character,
1390080	1394180	informing everyone how hard she has tried throughout this whole situation,
1394180	1396480	before going into the details of the situation.
1396480	1401880	As stated elsewhere, the seriousness of their son's condition wasn't understood until he was back in the US,
1401880	1405980	and although he had been receiving therapy, the issue appears to have not resolved itself.
1405980	1408980	In fact, the treatment has only intensified in the last year,
1408980	1412280	and the prognosis from professionals was clearly not optimistic.
1412280	1415280	This upsets James to the point where he becomes emotional,
1415280	1417980	once again emphasising how much they have tried.
1417980	1421280	Micah tag-teams in and rephrases James' comments.
1421880	1425780	There's not an ounce of our body that doesn't love you over me,
1425780	1429380	and there wasn't a minute that I didn't try our hardest,
1429380	1437880	and I think what James is trying to say is that after multiple assessments,
1437880	1445280	after multiple evaluations, numerous medical professionals have felt that he needed a different fit,
1445280	1448480	and that his medical needs, he needed more.
1448880	1452280	They then bring up why they haven't spoken about this situation prior.
1452280	1455380	According to them, they were trying to protect their son's privacy,
1455380	1461480	and wanted to avoid any legal ramifications, which appears to be quite an emotional topic for Micah once again.
1461480	1467280	Micah- And that's why, like, on Instagram and stuff, I've tried to, like, let you know as little as I could,
1467280	1471980	but I couldn't tell you anymore because I didn't want to mess anything up.
1472780	1478280	This is followed by the couple repeating this, before elaborating on the nature of their content,
1478280	1482280	and indirectly responding to some of the criticism that they had been receiving,
1482280	1488280	which admittedly seemed a bit off-key for a video on such a topic, but I suppose I can see the loose connection.
1488280	1492880	Micah- Worse, it's not about me at all, but it's just, like, this journey has been,
1493680	1498480	the last couple months have been, like, the hardest thing I could have ever imagined going to,
1498480	1507680	choosing to do, because ultimately, after pouring our guts and our heart into this little boy...
1508480	1511380	But what did the criticism in question ensue?
1511880	1513780	Well, let's talk about that.
1522180	1530080	Micah- Anything that happened in the home that was hard for- that's not fair for me to put out there publicly,
1530080	1537180	that's his privacy, so we're not gonna talk about that, that's not appropriate, and that'll never be appropriate.
1537180	1542380	As we've observed throughout this video, Micah was always one to display many aspects of her life,
1542380	1545380	even ones that most families would consider invasive.
1545380	1551080	This was not out of the ordinary for the genre, however, there are further conditions which many would argue
1551080	1554080	make Micah's handling in her videos exploitive.
1554480	1558280	First of all, her son's condition. In spite of my personal reservations,
1558280	1561680	most people aren't looking to topple the whole family vlogging scene.
1561680	1565880	However, when you're dealing with a child with an already fragile background,
1565880	1571180	sticking him in front of a camera can be questionable, especially if his affliction affects his ability
1571180	1576280	to signal consent, something which many would argue is already limited in a young child.
1576680	1579380	Secondly, Micah's approach to content creation.
1579380	1582980	I spoke about the repetitive nature of her videos, and with many topics,
1582980	1586380	that could be perceived as a person returning to the source of success.
1586480	1591580	However, when the source of success is a topic more sensitive, particularly when that story isn't your own,
1591580	1595480	returning to it in a way that may seem excessive could draw in criticism.
1595480	1598880	Micah didn't just regularly talk about the topic of adoption on her channel.
1598880	1604880	She also participated in promotions, even integrating them into portrayals of her relationship with her son.
1604880	1610880	In this Instagram post, she talks about how she wouldn't trade her son for anything, sponsored by Dreft.
1610880	1617380	And last but far from least, the context that such a decision would shine on Micah's previous statements and actions.
1617380	1622380	The mother-son loyalty was a regular selling point for the channel, and people began to hypothesize that
1622380	1626880	Micah was only interested in having an adopted son for as long as it was profitable,
1626880	1630980	and the fact that this was no longer the case meant that she had decided to give him up,
1630980	1634680	in spite of all the inspirational detergent-sponsored rhetoric.
1634680	1639780	To summarize, these distractors believed that Micah Stauffer had capitalized on the profitability of such a topic
1639780	1644280	when it suited her, and threw in the towel when the costs outweighed the benefits.
1644280	1650280	This is quite a serious theory, and in many ways, it was understandable that the Stauffers wanted to set the record straight.
1650280	1654180	However, I'll add that these hypotheses were not particularly popular at the time,
1654180	1657480	especially given that people weren't sure as to the child's location.
1657480	1663080	Their primary priority should have been to clear up any ambiguity regarding their son's whereabouts,
1663080	1667580	but they can't seem to resist the temptation to explain and justify themselves.
1667580	1674180	I didn't adopt a little boy to share these things publicly.
1674180	1678380	What you're left with is this very awkward video, which only worsens as it goes on.
1678380	1681380	It feels like they are more interested in justifying themselves,
1681380	1685980	but when your justification amounts to the appeal to knowledge that the audience doesn't have access to,
1685980	1691180	then you have to rely on their trust in your own authority, which clearly didn't work with Micah and Jimothy here.
1691780	1696680	Every now and then you may have gotten like a teeny like struggle or like a hardship
1696680	1702380	when I was trying to be like really raw and real, but we haven't intentionally.
1702380	1707080	The video was designed for their own audience, people who were going to innately trust what the Stauffers said.
1707080	1711980	However, it didn't take more than a couple days for this video to begin circulating outside the fan base,
1711980	1717480	and for it to attract the attention of more skeptical viewers who found their explanations rather unsatisfactory.
1717480	1723480	99 95% of the struggles we have never publicly aired ever.
1723480	1727080	99 95. What's the difference?
1727080	1731580	The video plays out like a half baked lawyer statement read by a second rate theater actor.
1731580	1737280	It feels like they're trying to convey emotion while dancing around any details that may actually implicate them,
1737280	1741580	essentially using tears as a shield to evade further challenges to their character.
1741580	1746080	They do compose themselves a bit more towards the end, but at this point it was rather futile,
1746080	1750680	and they still continue to attempt to justify their now clearly slanted portrayal.
1750680	1757480	We may come on socials like when I, for my channel, the reason I started my channel is to be positive and to bring people positivity,
1757580	1761780	even though we're struggling and that when we talk about hugs, it's a huge win for us.
1761780	1769980	Just because I may be positive on my stories or be having fun doing something fun doesn't mean that I'm not like still horribly hurting,
1769980	1771280	and the same for Jim.
1771280	1776780	It's obvious they're quite aware of how this revelation comes into conflict with a majority of their timeline,
1776780	1779180	so Micah has done her best to explain this away,
1779180	1784380	and it's not like I would be particularly angry at the fact that they were previously hopeful and optimistic,
1784380	1790780	and that forecast has since changed, changes happen, and our expectations may be subverted.
1790780	1794180	However, the explanation just makes it worse.
1794180	1801080	With pure intent of respecting his privacy, not to give you a fake facade or to be lack of transparency,
1801080	1806980	but to respect our son's privacy, and this is all that we're okay with sharing.
1806980	1812580	Because what Micah's explanation here implies is that these challenges were apparent from ages back,
1812580	1818680	and that they just chose not to broadcast them out of respect for their son's privacy, which seems all well and good,
1818680	1824480	but at the same time, why would you consciously promote an attitude or perception that was at odds with the reality?
1824480	1830880	It's important to remember that your content may have a great influence on the decision that audience members make with regards to adopting,
1830880	1834680	and omitting such details will deceive people whether you intend to or not.
1834680	1839880	On top of this, given the degree of coverage Micah provided to the adoption journey and the post-adoption life,
1839880	1847980	the defence of privacy was hard for many to buy, particularly given the fact that many of these videos were still public at the time of this sombre upload.
1847980	1852980	This once again made these comments feel like they were using the privacy card to deflect criticism,
1852980	1858180	implying that anyone who decided to cover these antics from here on out would be disrespecting their son,
1858180	1861780	despite them being the ones who uploaded the original content.
1861780	1866880	The Stalkers obviously anticipated the incoming criticism, and questions that they would face,
1866880	1873680	however, in attempting to prematurely respond to them, they drew more attention towards the lack of consistency within their justifications,
1873680	1878880	and in turn, only appeared to give further credence to the unforgiving theory surrounding their conduct,
1878880	1885380	and catalyzing a tidal wave of backlash, focused on exposing the Stalkers and their substandard parenting skills.
1885780	1887180	Let's talk about that then.
1897580	1903980	If Micah had made a video talking about the re-homing of her son, she could have outlined basic non-invasive details,
1903980	1908680	before conveying remorse about the possible misrepresentation that her content had conveyed,
1908680	1911880	while committing to protecting his privacy from here on out.
1911880	1914780	That would have at least curbed some of the criticism.
1914780	1917680	Unfortunately, she decided to give us this instead.
1918080	1925580	Micah's Mom- Thank you for everything, and we just really appreciate all of your support and kindness, but just please respect our privacy.
1925580	1926680	Micah's Dad- I respect his too.
1926780	1932880	The Stalkers video was like a challenge to the internet, and those residents were more than willing to take up the couple on their claims
1932880	1937280	that this was all a privacy issue, and that they had really tried their hardest.
1937280	1943680	As noticed, when this video was first released, Micah still had her videos about the adoption process public and fully monetized.
1943680	1947780	This became a source of criticism in the first few days where these uploads remained visible,
1947780	1952680	with a petition demanding the removal of them obtaining over 150,000 signatures.
1952680	1959280	It didn't take too long, but the Stalkers to respond by privating nearly all their content involving their adopted son around the turn of June.
1959280	1962480	This may have quelled the criticism if it was the sole talking point.
1962480	1970080	However, in leaving the content accessible, Micah and her husband also left it prone to deeper analysis that would kick up a bit of a buzz,
1970080	1972080	a sort of hornet's nest buzz.
1972080	1976480	Micah- If anything, my child is not returnable.
1976480	1981380	Clips like the ones I briefly touched on earlier were circulating on the more moderate end of the criticisms,
1981380	1986580	mostly with the purpose of emphasizing the Stauffer's convenient disregard for professional advice in the past,
1986580	1990480	which seems somewhat ironic given how heavily it is referenced in the new video.
1990480	1995780	It's unclear exactly when this U-turn happened, and although I'm sure people are pleased that Micah was actually listening,
1995780	1998280	some found it a bit too well timed to their liking.
1998280	2003880	Other people went straight for the fabric of the Stauffer's narrative, particularly regarding how much they hadn't shown.
2003880	2013280	Micah- No more. Come on, let's go. You're not gonna throw a fit when you don't get your way. That's not okay. Let's go.
2013280	2023880	Are you done fitting? Are you done? Are you all done?
2023880	2033080	Now, Micah sent the audience mixed signals when she strangely decided to alter 99-95%, almost as if she was attempting to calculate it herself.
2033080	2037280	However, what did that hypothetical 5% entail?
2037280	2042080	Micah- It's been crazy, so it's nice for everyone to start getting back on schedule.
2042080	2043480	What did you do?
2043480	2045280	I just did a thing.
2045280	2049980	Micah- See? You look like Ruka. You gave him a Ruka cut.
2049980	2052180	Was he like five million times cuter?
2052180	2057580	Oh my gosh, there's still hair all over the kids. Like, he was mad. He was like, we're not doing this.
2057580	2064180	Right. Well, although not always captured in the highest definition, many people archived uploaded clips where the Stauffers
2064180	2069580	behaved in ways that appeared unbecoming of them as parents, particularly given the status of their son.
2069580	2075380	This included a lot of filming that one may consider invasive, particularly when he appeared to be in distress,
2075380	2078580	the aforementioned clip coming from a video where they shaved his head.
2078580	2084480	However, this was far from the only incriminating recording, and the existence of multiple examples began to circulate
2084480	2087880	and depict a pattern of behavior which was less than flattering.
2087880	2090680	Micah- Did you have fun getting candy, big man?
2090680	2093880	He has had multiple meltdowns.
2093880	2095080	Micah- I'm not having a good day today.
2095080	2097280	We never tell you guys the truth.
2097280	2100280	And that's why you don't see other people on the vlog.
2100280	2102880	He's probably having a meltdown.
2102880	2104680	Are you done?
2104680	2107180	Micah- He's just having a bad day. He's a grumpy day today.
2107180	2113180	In this rather unnerving video, Micah seems to shame her son with all the swagger of Cruella De Vil meets Wine Mum.
2113180	2118180	Micah- All the things you wish you knew about my little boy, but we don't talk about that.
2118180	2121880	I'm not entirely sure the exact date of this post, but once again,
2121880	2126780	it didn't seem to fit in line with the mother who tried her hardest point of view.
2126780	2132380	On the one hand, I am willing to understand that it would have been confusing and frustrating when their adopted son was
2132380	2138480	first brought home and behaved in ways that challenged the family's precondition views of what raising a child would be like.
2138480	2142380	But there is a line, and too much of this content was already crossing it,
2142380	2146180	and they should have known better by then, and many people believe they did.
2156680	2161180	What are you doing in there, man? Reorganizing the shoe closet for me, eh?
2162980	2164380	It's a silly boy, huh?
2164380	2168580	The most worrisome of videos was this one, where James Dorfer appears to discover their son in the closet,
2168580	2173580	with duct tape around his wrist, the implication here being that Micah applied the duct tape to prevent their son from
2173580	2177080	sucking his thumb, with critics branding it as reckless and hypocritical,
2177080	2180980	particularly given that another one of their biological children was also caught sucking their thumb,
2180980	2183080	and Micah didn't appear to react to that at all.
2183080	2187880	With all this in mind, many people's outlook on Micah's motives became even more pessimistic,
2187880	2193680	with the idea that she was actually harboring resentment for her son, and was channeling frustration into punitive measures.
2194480	2200780	We're having meltdowns because we've already had breakfast, and we just want to keep eating,
2200780	2205680	and it's not time to eat, so we're gonna sit down. Sit down.
2206880	2209080	We have to wait. You can have a snack.
2209080	2213580	I don't have a problem giving him as much food as he wants. It's more principle.
2213580	2219080	It's about we don't just throw fits to get our way, so we're trying to work through that.
2219080	2223080	Another user found what appeared to be screenshots of Micah posting onto a Facebook group,
2223080	2227380	stating that she was considering adopting once more, but looking for something more low maintenance.
2227380	2232980	There is also a statement where she seems bothered by the fact that her son has a way of looking at people every time he eats.
2232980	2235980	According to her, it drives the husband bonkers.
2235980	2238280	It really was a tough time for the Stauffers.
2238280	2244080	The most allegedly telling post here is the one where Micah asked what learning difficulties most would consider challenging,
2244080	2247080	but the members of the adoption group would consider easy,
2247080	2252680	implying once more that she was only concerned with how an adopted child might be perceived by the audience.
2253080	2256880	This only brought their motives into further contention when it came to the adoption process.
2256880	2263380	People also found a comment of her stating that her son wanted this, despite the many documented communication issues that he has.
2263380	2268480	It was also alleged that given their trip to Bali, the Stauffers made their decision to give up the son in January
2268480	2270680	and take in the holiday once he had gone.
2270680	2276680	Although this is an intriguing theory, I do believe other videos around that time did show the son still in the household.
2276980	2281780	Regardless, people no longer trusted Micah to be honest in her videos when talking about this issue.
2281780	2284880	Much of the additional context not only contradicted her narrative,
2284880	2287880	but brought into question the entire chronology of her channel,
2287880	2292680	with the implication that she was more interested in how she could milk her son's adoption journey financially
2292680	2294580	than she was in her son's well being.
2294580	2300280	It was not a favorable portrait, and as the pressure mounted, Micah began to face the consequences.
2304080	2307080	There are plenty of ways that one can sustain public criticism.
2307080	2311080	However, today's condemnation was mostly promulgated from within the Twitter sphere,
2311080	2313580	which I typically feel quite ambivalent about.
2313580	2319380	Twitter is probably one of the platforms most susceptible to mob mentality, and I'm not a fan of mob mentality.
2319380	2324380	It is very easy to select parts of a story which are the most emotionally rousing and presented in a way
2324380	2329780	that is tailored towards receiving public recognition rather than representing a fair perspective.
2329780	2334380	However, with this in mind, it was hard for many to see the Stauffer side at all.
2334380	2340380	They were choosing not to defend themselves further, and even without commentary, their actions had spoken for themselves.
2340380	2345980	So many users set their sights on those associated with the Stauffers, most notably the brands,
2345980	2349180	and brands are notoriously vulnerable to negative publicity.
2349180	2354680	You saw it recently with G Fuel and Keemstar, a person universally renowned for controversy,
2354680	2359980	losing their support because suddenly people decide to specifically target that relationship.
2359980	2365680	Brands seem to care less about what people have actually done, and more about how many people complain.
2365680	2370180	In her stint online, Micah had accumulated an impressive entourage of sponsors,
2370180	2372780	including one she had used her adopted son to promote.
2372780	2378780	I already mentioned the Dreff sponsorship, but another quote from a video had her directly crediting the fabric softener
2378780	2383380	for enhancing their bond, however, the last time that they had worked together was 2018,
2383380	2388380	so clearly the lack of Dreff's presence in the relationship had put a strain on the family.
2388380	2396080	Dreff themselves did leave a comment in peak centrist form, stating that it was a sad and difficult situation for everyone involved.
2396080	2398680	Thank you Dreff for that insightful contribution.
2398680	2404480	However, they did emphasise they were not working with the Stauffers, while also implying they would not be working with them in the future.
2404480	2411180	Other brands were also fast to distance themselves from the mother of four, including Huggies, Mattel, Danimals, and Chili's.
2411180	2416380	However, the most blunt severance came from Kate Hudson's brand Fabletics, who had previously worked with Micah.
2416380	2422680	Upon being notified of the situation, Hudson informed an Instagram user that Stauffer had been terminated,
2422680	2428080	a rather definite stance. Although it became clear at the time that most brands were not working with Micah,
2428080	2433280	nor considering it, this sort of public pressure will likely follow through to prospective deals in the future,
2433280	2437680	tearing a pretty gaping hole into the channel's potential for coming sponsorships.
2437680	2443880	Nonetheless, some still felt that this was not sufficient retribution for Micah's actions, particularly given some of the clips,
2443880	2447480	and decided to take it one step further. What do I mean exactly?
2447580	2452880	While in their video breaking the news, the Stauffers disclosed that they didn't put their son through the system.
2452880	2459080	In fact, they quote, handpicked out a new forever family for him, which at least should inspire some confidence.
2459080	2467480	Kate Hudson- And they found somebody that they felt would be ultimately the best fit, and he is thriving, he is very happy,
2467480	2477680	he's doing really well, and his new mommy has medical professional training, and it is a very good fit.
2477680	2482880	To build onto this faith, the lawyers, you know, the people who definitely don't have any vested interest at all,
2482880	2488980	came forward to say what great people the Stauffers were as well, highlighting their caring and thoughtful nature.
2488980	2495980	To be honest, their message told the same story, there was just less crying, which was appreciated, but certainly not all vindicating.
2495980	2501980	And unfortunately, as people's questions about the Stauffer's conduct persisted, many began to inquire about the adopted son,
2501980	2507180	and if he was really in safe hands. Combine this with the already damning footage being collated online,
2507180	2511580	and with enough reports, law enforcement were compelled into opening a case on the couple.
2511580	2517580	Now, I think most people didn't expect anything to come of this because there was nothing abjectly criminal,
2517580	2523380	just some pretty subpar parenting, but people presented the complaints, and the authorities pursued it accordingly.
2523380	2527380	The first task was to locate the child. This was more of a challenge than it initially seemed,
2527380	2532280	because the Stauffers didn't go through any state systems which would keep records of the child's whereabouts.
2532280	2538980	In an interview with the Sheriff's Office, they stated they were working with multiple agencies to pinpoint the two-time adoptee's residence.
2538980	2543780	This provoked numerous news outlets and creators to run the story that the child had been lost,
2543780	2546780	making some wonder if something more sinister was afoot.
2546780	2552680	Fortunately, he was located, and in a statement shortly after, the police stated that they were confident that the Stauffers had followed
2552680	2558880	the appropriate adoption measures, but were still investigating any alleged wrongdoing, and touching base with all parties involved.
2558880	2564880	I would assume this investigation lasted throughout June, but the Stauffers likely remained silent due to the ongoing case,
2564880	2569680	though they did still find the time to remove their update video after it accrued over five million views.
2569680	2575980	Towards the end of the month, Micah would put out a post on her Instagram, first apologising unreservedly for all the hurt she caused,
2575980	2581380	and admitting she was ill-prepared for the adoption, opening up about her shortcomings in the adoption process,
2581380	2584780	and conceding that she was naive, foolish, and arrogant.
2584780	2590780	She finishes by addressing a couple of external allegations, averring that she did not adopt a son to gain wealth,
2590780	2594380	and in fact asserting that they invested a lot of money back into his care.
2594380	2599580	She also affirms that they are not under any investigation, which is slightly confusing given that a few days later,
2599580	2605180	the Delaware County Sheriff's Office released a statement announcing the completion of their quote investigation,
2605180	2610780	but I'm gonna assume Micah doesn't believe her audience are that stupid, and chalk it up to a terminological oversight.
2610780	2616980	Either way, both parties conclude that no egregious malpractice has occurred, and that everyone is where they should be,
2616980	2619780	which should at least provide some solace to those concerned.
2620180	2625280	Micah's post has received over 14,000 likes, with messages of support from those within the community,
2625280	2630380	however, she has heavily filtered the comments, which means it's hard to discern a consensus on the post.
2630380	2637580	Conversely, the Sheriff's Office's statement is open to all, leading some to express their disappointment and frustration at the lack of further action
2637580	2644380	in the comment section, with some stating that in spite of the office's supposedly in-depth report, key details have been overlooked,
2644380	2649380	which may implicate the Stauffers even more than they had been previously. Let's discuss that.
2660580	2666980	Now, anyone should be able to request an incident review from the Sheriff's Office, which I did and subsequently received.
2666980	2671980	There are multiple redactions for obvious reasons, and these can sometimes affect the sentence flow,
2671980	2674980	but I'll do my best to relay the information back regardless.
2674980	2681980	Before we go into the more contentious details, I think it's worth noting that the report found that the son had assimilated well into his new family,
2681980	2686380	and when monitoring his current health appeared to be in a happy and supportive environment,
2686380	2690980	which I hope we can all rejoice over, regardless of your opinion on the former parents.
2690980	2694980	Speaking of whom, we're at the centre of this very curious case.
2695980	2701980	It's crazy how you can grow so much in such a little amount of time. I'm definitely not who I was when we first started YouTube.
2701980	2707980	As expected, the report was unable to tell anyone too much about the adoption process other than it was legal,
2707980	2711980	and that the new family had received sufficient background checks, which was fine.
2711980	2716980	I don't think there's too much that people need to know there. There were minor disputes such as Micah's reference to fundraising,
2716980	2722980	where she discusses the GoFundMe, but not other methods such as the 1000 piece puzzle of their son,
2722980	2726980	so I'm sure if that was brought up she would have an explanation at hand. No.
2726980	2731980	What was more interesting were the explanations pertaining to their decision in dissolving this adoption.
2731980	2736980	Micah, and perhaps James, I don't know specific names have been redacted in this instance,
2736980	2742980	framed their now departed son as being physically aggressive towards his other siblings in the household.
2742980	2750980	They state that they had multiple carers quit on them due to his behaviour, and eventually had to hire a full-time employee just to keep their children safe,
2750980	2754980	which was very costly. They said multiple family members couldn't handle him,
2754980	2760980	and there have been numerous evaluations supporting the position that the son's place in the household was no longer tenable.
2760980	2764980	They also state they have video footage to support their comments with regards to his behaviour.
2764980	2770980	They state that although their biological offspring are now safe, one son will be needing therapy for what he endured,
2770980	2775980	and another daughter commented about how she now feels safer without their adopted son under their roof.
2775980	2781980	It appears that safety and cost were the two issues at the heart of this matter, and you can't often have one without the other.
2781980	2788980	Another specific instance of these two themes surfacing was the thumb incident, you know the clip where he had duct tape around his hand.
2788980	2796980	Well, Micah had an explanation for that as well, it appears that Charles was compulsively sucking his thumb to the point where he would start to develop blisters.
2796980	2802980	His therapist had recommended a thumb guard, however, he ripped off the one he had initially been provided with,
2802980	2809980	and Micah, in what she admits was a bad judgement call, instead of replacing it, decides to go full DIY and use duct tape to keep it on,
2809980	2814980	though she does stress this was a one-off. Thank god for that.
2814980	2817980	There are still some unanswered questions though.
2817980	2822980	We just pop it out of his mouth and kind of distract him, but his is a little bit different for comfort.
2822980	2824980	A little bit different. It makes him happy.
2824980	2825980	And the thumb guard never worked.
2825980	2827980	Yeah, thumb guard never worked.
2827980	2828980	Because he was so smart.
2828980	2830980	He was either really mad or he pulled it off.
2830980	2832980	No, he always figured out how to pull it off.
2832980	2834980	Pulled it off, but usually he was very mad before that.
2834980	2836980	If he didn't figure it out right away.
2836980	2845980	Yeah, so it was just one of those things where it was just, let it go, get him talking first and kind of work with him, and let him have that comfort for a little while.
2845980	2853980	Many people with experience in this era don't dispute the possibility that the reported behaviour from the child in question was present,
2853980	2855980	particularly one who was on the spectrum.
2855980	2861980	However, people did take issue with the framing, which presented the son as an instigator, or an aggressor.
2861980	2866980	If you keep in mind the youngster was now in another household where he is reported to be completely happy,
2866980	2870980	some felt there must have been certain conditions that had precipitated his outbursts.
2870980	2875980	On top of this, many felt there were circumstantial details which didn't appear compatible with the Stauffer's narrative.
2875980	2878980	For example, the Bali trip that the Stauffers took in January.
2878980	2882980	This already seemed like a questionable idea given the alleged circumstances by the parents,
2882980	2885980	but many observed that in the video prior to their departure,
2885980	2890980	the son appears to be freely roaming the house without causing the panic that the parents had recounted.
2890980	2897980	Another thing he loves is wrestling on the floor with dad, he will instigate him in the evening to try to get him to wrestle him,
2897980	2903980	or like roughhouse, which trust me, my other son is obsessed with too, but that is one thing that he loves to do.
2903980	2909980	On top of this, many argued that the financial reasoning didn't stand up given how the Stauffers purchased a new house,
2909980	2914980	took multiple holidays, and indulged in luxury items, such as what is alleged to be a Cartier bracelet,
2914980	2917980	spotted while she was ironically lamenting their son's therapy costs.
2918980	2923980	Some people also pointed out the Stauffers refusal to share certain records regarding their adopted son with the police,
2923980	2928980	though I assume in that instance they were acting on the advice of their lawyers, so little can be taken there.
2928980	2936980	As far as his personality goes, he is the cuddliest, most energetic, funnest, giggly little guy ever.
2936980	2942980	He is strong willed, he knows exactly what he wants, and I love that about him.
2942980	2948980	One thing I love about him, no matter who is having the worst day in the world, if he comes and smiles at you,
2948980	2951980	or giggles, everybody smiles.
2951980	2956980	In another interview published in September 2019, just after the child had turned 4,
2956980	2961980	Micro appears to convey the message that as a child he was relatively low maintenance, to quote,
2961980	2966980	He is a great kid, and his condition doesn't involve that much overall care.
2966980	2972980	All you need is a big heart, and practice patience every day. It's a different kind of patience.
2972980	2977980	He does receive 30 hours of ABA, Applied Behaviour Analysis, in-home therapy a week,
2977980	2981980	and goes to private preschool to help reach his highest potential.
2981980	2988980	If the adoption was dissolved at latest May, this provides an almost non-existent window of time for the child's behaviour
2988980	2993980	to regress in the way that Micro claimed it did, particularly without any clear stimulus at all.
2993980	2999980	Many brought attention to the numerous changes that the son had endured, including moving house, school enrolment,
2999980	3005980	vacations, all that may provoke an adverse response from someone on the spectrum, yet didn't seem to.
3005980	3009980	First time ever in Florida.
3009980	3010980	He's probably living the dream.
3010980	3014980	There are a lot of people who are understandably frustrated at the police's conclusion,
3014980	3017980	but I can't say I'm surprised that no further action was taken.
3017980	3022980	Although there are very legitimate qualms with certain decisions made by the family which we'll discuss soon,
3022980	3028980	I couldn't see a state prosecutor taking the case as it was, especially as law enforcement seemed to perceive it.
3028980	3034980	If you assumed the courts would err on the side of caution, then a lot of it would be defended as misdirected attempts
3034980	3040980	to establish authority, or as under pressure rash decision making, rather than a pattern of malicious misdeeds.
3040980	3045980	I'm not entirely sure a court case would have really settled any outstanding gripes either.
3045980	3051980	The Stauffers are still parents to four children, and although that shouldn't affect legal liability logically speaking,
3051980	3058980	I think an extended legal procedure may just place further stress on the remaining children, and I don't think anyone really wants that.
3058980	3064980	You may even have to involve a child who everyone seems so concerned about, it all seems a bit too much trouble.
3064980	3069980	In spite of this, I understand that the inconsistencies probably leave people rather dissatisfied,
3069980	3074980	and although you can accept that there are details which we will never know, and we don't have to know,
3074980	3079980	I think it'd be nice to arbitrate some truth from an ordeal filled with so many conflicting messages.
3079980	3085980	I don't know about you guys, but it's just like the craziest thing, like every day it starts to hit me, like he's my real son.
3085980	3091980	Like, he had a foster mom, and he had a real mom at one time, and they were amazing parts of his life,
3091980	3095980	but it's so crazy to think that like, I'm his only real, like, I'm his mom.
3095980	3100980	Micah's detractors frame her as self-interested, self-serving, and self-gratifying,
3100980	3105980	using an adoptee to further her own online image and fuel a white savior complex,
3105980	3112980	whereas those more sympathetic may see her as a victim of her own romanticist perceptions of what adopting a child would ensue,
3112980	3118980	trying to withstand the inevitable failure. Was this a mother who adopted a son for the purpose of profit,
3118980	3123980	or was she just an idealist in way over her head, consumerist or fantasist?
3123980	3126980	Well, let's take one more look.
3136980	3140980	Micah Stauffer made a series of awful decisions, there is little debate over that.
3140980	3145980	She should have listened to expert advice all those years ago, when they told her that this was not a good idea,
3145980	3153980	yet she didn't. So here we are today, regardless of the truth surrounding their son, as adults, they ultimately bear that responsibility.
3154980	3161980	Like, I remember, like, praying to God, saying like, I trusted you so much, and like, you gave me a little bit more than I,
3161980	3165980	than I knew what to do with, and I just wish he could be able to overcome this.
3165980	3168980	And we love our son so much, like, we want the best for him.
3168980	3179980	And I'm not saying autism is sad or a bad diagnosis, but just like, everything, like, kind of just compounded down together, and it was hard.
3179980	3184980	There's no degree of preparation that you can possibly perform which will guarantee a pitfall-free adoption,
3184980	3189980	particularly when dealing with systems which may not be subject to the same scrutiny that you find at home.
3189980	3194980	The Stauffers had multiple opportunities to stop and pay attention to the advice that they had been given,
3194980	3200980	to actually carefully evaluate the condition of their son, and act accordingly. In my opinion, they did not.
3200980	3205980	But all I want to say is, I'm bonding with my kid. I'm doing what I'm doing.
3205980	3212980	We put our lives on social media, and I'm not gonna have people sit there and treat me like a fool because I'm not gonna take it.
3212980	3215980	I'm not the kind of person that just takes stuff, and that's fine.
3215980	3220980	Mike Stauffer's channel committed to presenting a profile of this mother who is ready to make a difference,
3220980	3225980	who believed that as long as you dig deep, there is nothing that cannot be achieved.
3225980	3231980	This may be true to an extent, but sometimes digging deep means more than just what you see on inspirational TV dramas.
3231980	3237980	It means education, it means analysis, it can even mean changing your own life to accommodate another,
3237980	3241980	and there was clearly too much Micah had established previously that she was not ready to give up.
3241980	3247980	Micah wanted to introduce her son to the Stauffer life, but that's not a membership everyone is cut out for,
3247980	3254980	yet in spite of this, the channel's uploads appeared to portray their new son as coping with the sometimes chaotic lifestyle very aptly,
3254980	3257980	even if this sometimes meant unhealthy coping mechanisms.
3257980	3262980	This was echoed in interviews, where Micah regularly emphasised that in spite of the challenges,
3262980	3267980	the son wasn't excessively disruptive, and Micah had found it to be a rewarding experience in itself.
3267980	3270980	To audience members, it appears that this gamble had paid off.
3270980	3275980	Contrast this to the police report, which framed their relationship as under severe strain,
3275980	3280980	and presenting the son's condition as completely out of control, and portraying him as a ruffian.
3280980	3282980	It felt like they were talking about two different children.
3282980	3288980	With such conflicting messages, many accused the Stauffers of omitting and exaggerating details of their convenience
3288980	3291980	to construct an image which justified their perspective when it suited them.
3291980	3298980	Most couldn't see this as being a sudden shift, even if you consider the fact that the child's condition had worsened
3298980	3303980	in such a time period, it would be very out of character for a parent to legitimately give up on a child
3303980	3309980	who they had nurtured for years on the basis of a few turbulent months, for a condition that they understand and acknowledge.
3310980	3315980	So this begs the question that many have asked, what happened? Why the inconsistencies?
3315980	3317980	Let's talk theory.
3319980	3324980	The first theory is more sympathetic, though still quite critical. We'll call it the denial theory.
3324980	3328980	This is the one that Micah appears to appeal to in her Instagram statement.
3328980	3333980	The denial theory dictates that the challenges with the son in question had actually been more prevalent
3333980	3336980	than they had been represented as on the channel, and in interviews,
3336980	3340980	Micah tried to excuse the problems in an attempt to prove those who doubted her wrong,
3340980	3343980	and to try and show that she was ready for the challenge.
3343980	3347980	However, she was ill-equipped, and the environment wasn't appropriate for the child,
3347980	3351980	but she was too set in her ways, and it wasn't until these problems became even more apparent
3351980	3356980	where she had to swallow her pride, and realise she was not cut out for this job.
3356980	3361980	This is supported by evidence of Micah's own concessions of existing behavioural issues over the years,
3361980	3364980	and even private posts which appeared to show that there were basic elements
3364980	3367980	that she was struggling to cope with in the past few years.
3367980	3372980	However, with this in mind, many would argue that these posts also reflect a more cynical theory,
3372980	3376980	given how one in particular appears to prioritise optics over truth.
3376980	3378980	So let's talk about the clout theory.
3378980	3383980	This theory adopts the belief that the Stauffers took in a child with the intent to profit off their plight.
3383980	3388980	Adopting children from abroad was already shown to amplify traffic and bolster channels,
3388980	3393980	and Micah, well known for appealing to her subscriber base, sought to capitalise on this trend.
3393980	3398980	She would subsequently publicise and monetise all content relating to his adoption and home life,
3398980	3401980	with the motivation of pandering to people's optimistic nature,
3401980	3405980	and the romanticised notions they held about adopting children.
3405980	3408980	However, over time, the cost of maintaining this brand was exceeding the profit,
3408980	3412980	and as the returns dwindled, and their child remained financially demanding,
3412980	3417980	the parents decided that his presence was no longer advantageous, and decided to end this journey.
3417980	3420980	This is obviously supported by some of the evidence that we have already discussed,
3420980	3423980	which demonstrate a clear consciousness of one's public image,
3423980	3427980	but also a lot of behavioural patterns that seem to be present in their content,
3427980	3430980	most accentuated by their shockingly bad announcement video,
3430980	3434980	which appeared to be focused around preserving people's perception of themselves once more.
3434980	3438980	The police report didn't flatter Micah either, with the confession that the duct tape incident
3438980	3442980	occurred all because she wasn't prepared to spend a couple hundred more quid on a new one.
3442980	3446980	On the other hand, given the cost of adoption, and the subsequent complications,
3446980	3450980	it seems like a pretty hefty investment to sink in, without the guarantee of returns,
3450980	3454980	and even if the formula had worked on other channels, there was no assurance that it would work here.
3454980	3459980	On top of this, if they had enough money to sink into an adoption, even with the donations,
3459980	3462980	it would be a strange pursuit for the sole purpose of wealth.
3462980	3468980	Would it have really been worth it? There must have been some personal sacrifice, right?
3468980	3472980	It's hard to look at the situation, and not at least consider that Micah was far too preoccupied
3472980	3476980	with how people looked at her, to the point where it often felt like she prioritised that
3476980	3479980	above the wellbeing of those who she purported to care about.
3479980	3483980	She may have been set in her ways, and in denial to an extent,
3483980	3487980	I don't doubt there was a degree of ignorance, but it also feels like the conceptual benefits
3487980	3491980	of having such a child on a YouTube channel corrupted her decision making.
3491980	3496980	When other people told her it was wise to revive the son with a more appropriate environment,
3496980	3500980	she turned a blind eye, proudly proclaiming her defiance,
3500980	3504980	only falling back on expert opinion when it suited her agenda.
3504980	3509980	Whether that agenda was more cost motivated or family motivated, I do not know.
3509980	3513980	Micah references both in the report, and both could be seen as plausible reasons,
3513980	3516980	but I don't think either could fully justify the outcome.
3516980	3522980	She favoured the pursuit of this vision of a family over the wellbeing of a child who had no say,
3522980	3525980	and that was inexcusable.
3526980	3532980	A lot of people have reflected on this situation with the mind that Micah's era was giving up on a child of her own.
3532980	3536980	However, although the decision may have been the catalyst for her critics,
3536980	3540980	the greatest mistake that Micah made was adopting a child in the first place.
3540980	3543980	The police report also disclosed that the adoption was never finalised,
3543980	3545980	which is an optional process in the US.
3545980	3549980	This revelation led many to assert that the Stauffers never planned to keep their adopted son.
3549980	3554980	Although I personally feel this is unlikely given how they hammered in the rhetoric of adoption being forever,
3554980	3557980	it may show they harboured more reservations than they displayed,
3557980	3562980	or to be honest, they may not have considered it important, which also may be indicative.
3562980	3566980	Many people asked if Micah would do the same if it was a biological son,
3566980	3569980	and the answer is obviously a resounding no.
3569980	3571980	Well, we hope at least.
3571980	3573980	This was one of the focal points for public opinion,
3573980	3578980	this treatment of a child who they welcomed into their family, but similarly gave away.
3578980	3582980	On principle, the outcome is positive, the child is in a better place now,
3582980	3583980	there is no doubt about that.
3583980	3586980	He has a family who are well equipped to deal with his needs,
3586980	3590980	and the Stauffer family are likely relieved of a challenging relationship as well,
3590980	3593980	and hopefully have more time to dedicate it to the rest of their children.
3593980	3599980	However, many can't help but feel displeased by the conclusion because adversity is part of parenting,
3599980	3602980	and that means stepping up to the challenge, not running from it,
3602980	3606980	so although dissolving the adoption may have been the right decision under the circumstances,
3606980	3611980	it seemed to be an outcome only precipitated by the parents incompetence.
3612980	3615980	It is hard, it is not easier with each kid, it does not feel the same,
3615980	3620980	it feels harder with every single child I've had, every time it's harder,
3620980	3623980	because different kids have different emotional needs,
3623980	3627980	and different kids have different needs, and different kids want different things.
3627980	3630980	As mentioned, adoption is no facile enterprise,
3630980	3634980	when many adopt, it's with the commitment that it is the creation of an inseparable bond
3634980	3637980	which will withstand the challenges that such an adventure may throw at you.
3637980	3642980	When you bring a child into your family, people expect you to treat them like your own biological offspring,
3642980	3644980	after all, they are no less human.
3644980	3648980	In a way, Micah did, but she applied the blueprint store for formula
3648980	3651980	which in her mind had worked with her other children.
3651980	3654980	When it worked with their son, it worked, it was great,
3654980	3657980	when it didn't, well, he clearly just had some learning to do.
3662980	3665980	There is never a one-size-fits-all approach when it comes to parenting,
3665980	3668980	and although Micah professed to have understood this eventually,
3668980	3670980	this wasn't reflected enough in her actions.
3670980	3674980	For example, in the police report, Micah remarks that the son would regularly react poorly
3674980	3679980	when his siblings were overwhelming him, retreating to the closet and rocking himself non-stop.
3679980	3682980	Yet, Micah still made the decision to have another child,
3682980	3685980	which they gave birth to around mid-2019,
3685980	3690980	which would mean a high-maintenance infant around the house likely further contributing
3690980	3692980	to a stressful environment for their son.
3692980	3697980	It's these successive poor decisions that could easily aggravate a condition,
3697980	3701980	and to many onlookers, it just felt like they were playing Russian Roulette with his triggers.
3701980	3706980	Pure theory here, but maybe that's why they took the infant abroad
3706980	3709980	to remove that negative stimulus from the son's life.
3709980	3713980	Micah's daughter should not have adopted, not just for that reason,
3713980	3714980	but for a multitude of others.
3714980	3717980	They were not ready for what the child's diagnosis meant,
3717980	3720980	and with the information that the child's disposition was not suspected,
3720980	3723980	they should have thought much harder than they did.
3723980	3727980	Adoption is not going to plan, and coming to an end isn't an immensely rare eventuality.
3727980	3731980	It happens in a minority but substantial percentage of adoptions,
3731980	3736980	and I'm sure that many people involved in those have not acted with reckless or selfish will.
3736980	3738980	Sometimes these things don't work out,
3738980	3742980	so I don't want to attack everyone who has ever had to give up an adopted child.
3742980	3748980	But the Stauffers had a window to act and retain their dignity, and that window passed.
3748980	3753980	Guys, I have to say, you like the fast cars, don't you?
3753980	3757980	I think he's definitely my son, aren't you?
3757980	3758980	Are you my boy?
3758980	3761980	Yeah, you like fast cars too, like Rad?
3761980	3763980	It's so cool, guys.
3763980	3767980	Put the finances aside, put the channel aside, this was for the child,
3767980	3770980	and his position on such a family channel was already debatable,
3770980	3773980	but the revelation that he was suffering from an affliction
3773980	3778980	which directly inhibited his ability to communicate should have been cause for serious rumination.
3778980	3782980	At that point, with the advice of experts, Micah should have made decision
3782980	3787980	whether to find a more appropriate home for the son or prepare herself to make significant changes to her own life.
3787980	3791980	She chose the third option, which was to press on with the predetermined plans,
3791980	3797980	and upping the dosage on the sappy, sentimental, spiritual language of how it was just meant to be.
3797980	3804980	He's been home for, like I said, almost two years, and I don't know what I would do without him.
3804980	3808980	We have hard days. We do. Not every day is easy.
3808980	3815980	When you have a kiddo that has so many wants and desires and wants to be heard all the time and is strong-willed,
3815980	3820980	you have communication struggles, and some days are just hard.
3820980	3825980	One thing that's changed this year more than ever is I feel like our connection as a family
3825980	3829980	has gotten so profoundly amazing.
3829980	3833980	It is easily one of my favourite people in the entire world.
3833980	3838980	Micah and James Dorfer will have to live with the ramifications of the decisions they made,
3838980	3840980	even if that only extends to social media.
3840980	3844980	With everything in mind, it's hard to really see how Micah will relaunch her channel.
3844980	3848980	It has remained dormant since the situation, and maybe that's for the best.
3848980	3851980	James' channel remains active and still attracts significant viewership.
3851980	3857980	Whether he will continue to be the sole uploader for the family bread is another question that only time will answer.
3857980	3862980	I'll make this clear, I don't necessarily disagree with showing childhood mental struggles in video form.
3862980	3867980	Particularly for educational purposes, there is a lot that one can learn from such a portrayal,
3867980	3873980	but at the same time, it needs to be presented fairly and impartially with respect to the child at the centre of the spectacle,
3873980	3876980	and that's an aspect that a lot of family channels fall short on,
3876980	3882980	because too often, they're more concerned with catering to an image rather than presenting a faithful portrait,
3882980	3886980	based on the trials and tribulations that a family under such stress would have to confront.
3886980	3892980	Many asked if Micah would have treated a biological son the same way that she treated her adopted son.
3892980	3897980	It's an easy and mostly rhetorical question that does provoke some good discourse at least.
3897980	3900980	However, for me, there was a more interesting question.
3900980	3903980	Would she have done this at all if she didn't have a YouTube channel?
3903980	3911980	And if no, is it okay for an individual to have such a consequential decision riding on the existence of that platform?
3911980	3915980	YouTube influences the creative liberties we take, the decisions we make.
3915980	3921980	That is beyond doubt, but where is the line? Where does YouTube end and real life begin?
3921980	3923980	These are the questions that I'll leave with you today.
3923980	3927980	I hope they are thought-provoking enough, even if they are a little simple.
3927980	3934980	You have a favorite failure, and how has maybe a failure in your life set you up for future success?
3934980	3942980	So I wouldn't call it a failure, but I would call it something that was really, really, really, really, really challenging.
3942980	3946980	We recently adopted a little guy from China. Definitely not a failure.
3946980	3952980	But when we adopted him, he had a totally different diagnosis than what we were told.
3952980	3958980	We were told that he had a brain tumor, and as a cancer nurse, I was comfortable with that moving forward.
3958980	3967980	And he actually had severe brain damage, severe autism, and some severe delays that may mean that he may live with me for the rest of his life.
3967980	3969980	Something that we just literally were not ready for.
3969980	3975980	A lot of people believe that Micah is a narcissist, and although it's not a discussion that I'm going to have right now,
3975980	3976980	I can't blame them.
3976980	3980980	She'd welcome these interviews, which keep at probation onto her as this selfless Samaritan,
3980980	3984980	embracing this image bestowed onto her through this adoption journey.
3984980	3987980	Yet when the tables turned, the best she could do was this.
3987980	3991980	Do I feel like a failure as a mom? Like, 500%.
3991980	3995980	You get no points for stating the obvious here. Micah had failed.
3995980	3999980	Not for letting her son leave, but for the way the son was treated while he was there.
3999980	4004980	The audience deserved better, the children deserved better, he deserved better.
4004980	4008980	Family channels represent an immovable demographic on the YouTube platform.
4008980	4011980	The influence they have in shaping people's lives is undeniable.
4011980	4015980	But before you put them behind a camera, make sure you put them first.
4015980	4020980	And if you preach the principles of loyalty and commitment, then expect to be held to those standards.
4020980	4024980	And don't be surprised if people are angry if you failed to practice that commitment yourself.
4024980	4029980	Are you constructing a YouTube channel around a family, or a family around a YouTube channel?
4029980	4032980	Maybe that question should have been asked to Micah.
4032980	4040980	When I started the adoption process, I never really found very much material on what it was like when you get home.
4040980	4045980	And I think that this could be a really cool resource for somebody who's gone through the journey.
4045980	4051980	But once you get home, and once you kind of find that perfect niche for your family, it's amazing.
4051980	4053980	It is absolutely amazing.
4053980	4057980	Be aware, and make sure you are capable of the challenges you are facing up to.
4057980	4062980	And if you do make a mistake, for Christ's sake, don't make a terrible video about it.
4062980	4068980	99, 95% of the struggles we have never publicly aired, ever.
4068980	4071980	What were they thinking?
4087980	4112980	So yes guys, that was the video.
4112980	4115980	I hope you enjoyed, I hope you had a good time.
4115980	4117980	I'm sure I did, I had a great time.
4127980	4130980	God, I can't contain my enthusiasm.
4130980	4137980	Anyhow, I want to give a big thanks, extend my gratitude to the fantastic editors for the work they did.
4137980	4139980	Brilliant work, as always, I'm sure.
4139980	4143980	Go check them out, they'll be in the pinned comment, there are links.
4143980	4149980	Also want to give a big thanks to my patrons, $10 patreons up on there right now.
4154980	4164980	And a special thanks to my $50 patrons, Samhala Baloo, Caroline, Hypercube Amanda Devon, and Shiro Chigo.
4164980	4171980	I also want to extend a special thanks to my $100 patrons, Christopher Karas, and Ileana Banana.
4171980	4173980	Great name, I love that one, I love that one.
4173980	4180980	And another $100 patreon, PokeySirenYT, who has asked for a custom message, which is the first time.
4180980	4186980	This has been exercised, but I will happily honor it, and he wants to tell you to go and check out his YouTube channel
4186980	4188980	and provide some constructive criticism.
4188980	4194980	What a lovely, lovely individual. I will leave it alongside his patreon credit in the pinned comment.
4194980	4199980	Anyhow, my social medias will also be in the pinned comment, I've been particularly active recently,
4199980	4203980	but maybe I'll be more active by the time this video is out, who knows.
4203980	4209980	Otherwise, I don't really have too much else to add, so I hope by the time this is out, we're all a bit more free.
4209980	4217980	It feels right now that even though it's beginning to ease, the tension remains,
4217980	4221980	and I hope that is all lifted off our shoulders soon enough.
4221980	4229980	Same I love to you guys, but until then, I'm the right pinion, and I will see you in the next one.
4251980	4253980	Thanks for watching!
