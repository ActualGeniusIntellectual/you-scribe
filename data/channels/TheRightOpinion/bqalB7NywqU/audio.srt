1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,820
Now I'm sure a lot of you remember Club Penguin from your childhood, a game played by millions

2
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:08,580
of kids around the world.

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:12,300
So as a lot of you might know, the popular kids website Club Penguin announced that they

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:15,180
will be shutting down on the 29th of March this year.

5
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:16,180
This was a mistake!

6
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:17,180
Ahhh!

7
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:18,180
No Club Penguin, please don't do this!

8
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:19,180
Why don't you do it?

9
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:20,180
It's a reality game!

10
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:21,180
This is a-

11
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:26,620
A lot of people are, as you may have noticed, not too happy about this, but unfortunately

12
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:28,860
the people behind this don't really care.

13
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:33,280
The mobile and desktop versions of the game will be shut down in order to allow the team

14
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,340
to focus their efforts on Club Penguin Island.

15
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:40,100
So basically you may have heard the news that Club Penguin Island is shutting down.

16
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:45,020
Club Penguin Island had an incredibly short lifespan for an online multiplayer game.

17
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:47,940
The original Club Penguin experience no longer existed.

18
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:49,460
So where did things go wrong?

19
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:06,860
When did Club Penguin die?

20
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:09,340
A simple question with a simple answer.

21
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:10,340
Yes?

22
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:11,820
Well, perhaps not.

23
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:16,340
Hello, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with

24
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:20,600
too much free time, but this time isn't just any time.

25
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,420
Once again, it's gamer time.

26
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:24,860
That's right, you heard me correctly.

27
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:28,840
We are going back to the gaming corner of YouTube, because as I have proven time and

28
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:34,100
time again, I am a gamer, and today we are looking at an online MMO, which some would

29
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:38,220
argue is unrivaled in the gamer spirit that it has fostered.

30
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:42,380
Now you may have suspected an undertone of irony there, but don't be fooled, my friends,

31
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:47,140
because back in the golden days when The Right Opinion was a young lad full of zest and zeal,

32
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:50,660
there were three games which shaped his early online experience.

33
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:56,140
Those being RuneScape, Neopets, and the topic of interest today, Club Penguin.

34
00:01:56,140 --> 00:02:00,020
I can't remember which order I played them in exactly, though I could take an educated

35
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:04,060
guess, but I still remember them fondly for being able to capture sentiments of wide-eyed

36
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:08,780
wonder and imagination that seemed far beyond my grasp these days, and I know this wasn't

37
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:10,500
just a personal experience.

38
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:15,060
I'm sure many of you reminisce to a time where such avenues felt like a genuine escape to

39
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,060
a different world.

40
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:21,460
However, as time has progressed, so have we, and such memories fade into the background

41
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:22,780
of a distant past.

42
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:26,860
Nonetheless, I find some consolation in the thought that if I ever wanted to attempt to

43
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:32,460
emulate that escapism again, those sites are, as of right now, ready and waiting to welcome

44
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,460
me home.

45
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:36,060
Well, all except Club Penguin.

46
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:39,060
Yes, Club Penguin, an abandoned abode.

47
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:43,540
Their tragic demise seemed intangible to many, for a site which had once boasted over 200

48
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:46,340
million registered users, and 30 million active users.

49
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:50,340
However, its last few years have been played by drama and conflict, eventually culminating

50
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,020
in rather cataclysmic fashion.

51
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:56,900
For those who are unfamiliar, Club Penguin, sometimes abbreviated to CP, was an online

52
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:01,340
game in which your character could take the form of a penguin, and participate in various

53
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:06,800
activities all over this online world, full of many other colourful, fluffy characters

54
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,620
controlled by very real other users.

55
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:14,020
As a child, it taught you the ropes of online safety, and interpersonal friendships.

56
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:18,220
It had some pretty fun games too, and for the young mind, Club Penguin helped prepare

57
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:22,980
individuals for what the internet was going to throw at us, which is an ever more important

58
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:28,380
learning curve in today's society, yet in spite of its supposed relevance, it no longer

59
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:34,620
plays a prominent part in the online sphere, and today we'll be finding out how that happened.

60
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:39,220
However, to understand its end, we do need to go back to the beginning, and maybe ride

61
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:43,460
a little background for anyone who never had the privilege to roleplay online as a

62
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:46,900
virtual bird, unless you're one of those avians, of course.

63
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,540
However, I think it's time to bring in a friend.

64
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:54,420
Now, if you're familiar with today's guest, you may have recently seen me pull off a legendary

65
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:57,020
voice performance on one of his newest videos.

66
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,620
Well, book him, boys.

67
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:02,620
Oh, you f**king muck! F**k you!

68
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:07,020
I'm gonna f**k take you down to Tardis Head!

69
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:13,180
Normally, I charge for such convincing characterisation, however, his payment was merely his undying

70
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:15,100
love and this feature.

71
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:21,340
Ladies and gentlemen, talking about the origins of Club Penguin, I present to you, the internet historian.

72
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:27,500
Ah, thank you, thank you, real applause, thank you.

73
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:33,340
Here we are at the Club Penguin, so allow me to break the ice with the story of how

74
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:39,980
Club Penguin came to be one of the most successful online platforms... ever.

75
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:45,980
First, I need to introduce you to three men, Lane, Lance, and Dave.

76
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:52,380
Lance was developing for Dave at New Horizons Productions, where Lane was hired as a sales

77
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:55,020
representative, so that's how they knew each other.

78
00:04:55,580 --> 00:05:00,140
At this time, Lance would be working on web-based games, though Lance's previous projects had

79
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:07,020
included the unfinished snowblasters, experimental penguins, penguin chat, penguin football chat,

80
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:10,140
there's a bit of a trend here, and ballistic biscuit.

81
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:15,980
One day, while Lane, Dave, and Lance were drinking some Tim Hortons and looking at the

82
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:21,420
local moose, there's animals fighting in the front lawn, they realised that the current

83
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:27,340
online market wasn't offering a safe site for kids to socialise in a fun and interactive way.

84
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:32,940
And that needed to change, in the words of famous philosopher Helen Lovejoy.

85
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:40,940
So when these three saw the gap in the market and realised the combined power and innovation

86
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:47,340
they harnessed, they saw a business opportunity, and decided to fuse their energy into one

87
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:55,420
earth-shattering, world-dominating, universe-ending project known as Penguin Chat 4, soon to be

88
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:59,180
known as Club Penguin.

89
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:03,260
Work began in 2004, and the name was picked in 2005.

90
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:07,740
They used Penguin Chat 2 as a springboard for various prototypes before reaching a

91
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:12,620
satisfying product, launching the beta test on August 22nd of 2005.

92
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:14,300
It went well.

93
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,140
Very well.

94
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:20,380
So well, in fact, that they had a party to trial the server capacity.

95
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,140
Now there's an animal part.

96
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:26,220
Club Penguin was originally set to release for 2010, but they thought,

97
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,860
solid, and dropped that bad boy in October.

98
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:35,340
It launched with 15,000 users, but by March 2006 had surged to 1.4 million,

99
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:38,940
before reaching 2.6 by September in the same year.

100
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:40,220
Not bad.

101
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:44,700
And by the two-year anniversary, Club Penguin hit 3.9 million,

102
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,300
despite lacking a marketing budget.

103
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:50,860
However, this is when the big wigs began to take notice.

104
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:54,220
The Club Penguin crew had previously turned down a few offers,

105
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:57,580
but then comes Disney, who represents a pretty large sum of cash,

106
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:01,340
and strikes a deal with the founders who hand over Club Penguin and their parent company.

107
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:03,740
Dave, Lance, and Lane stay on to work for the game,

108
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:08,540
but individually leave the company over the following years to take on new personal projects.

109
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:12,300
In the years following Disney's acquisition, Club Penguin continued to grow,

110
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:16,140
launching multiple spin-offs, hosting sponsored events, hiring more staff,

111
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:19,100
opening new servers, and setting up offices all over the world.

112
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:25,180
By 2013, Club Penguin had over 200 million registered accounts,

113
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:27,180
alongside a highly dedicated fandom.

114
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:31,580
Quite the achievement for what was once a humble indie game conceived by three amigos,

115
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:34,540
and even more impressive considering they were Canadian.

116
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:38,140
Everything was going swimmingly for our frosty friends.

117
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:40,060
However, that would soon change.

118
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,500
To what exactly?

119
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:45,340
You'll have to find out, after we've spoken about rage.

120
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:48,220
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

121
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,740
Excuse me, I would like to finish the ad, please.

122
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,020
They're not paying me this time.

123
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:52,540
The people deserve to know.

124
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:54,380
Oh, Jesus Christ, out.

125
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:56,620
It's about my sheer love for the game.

126
00:07:56,620 --> 00:08:03,660
Out, go, leave, leave, right now, pad it with you, you and your shadow man, bollocks.

127
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:04,620
It's my turn.

128
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:13,340
Uh, sorry guys, um, wow, wow, thank you Professor Historian,

129
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:18,060
I must confess, it is quite the honour to host such a distinguished academic

130
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:20,300
for this prestigious esteemed topic.

131
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:23,500
And as my friend has likely depicted, in its first decade,

132
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:27,820
Club Penguin ascended the ranks and achieved astounding levels of success,

133
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:31,980
establishing itself as a torchbearer for child-friendly online platforms.

134
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:34,540
It was something worthy of celebration.

135
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:40,060
However, come 2016, this was all about to change, and not in a fun way.

136
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:46,380
So, without further ado, we must now look towards the downturn of Club Penguin,

137
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:49,820
and the factors that were instrumental in its unfortunate fate.

138
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:54,780
Ladies and gentlemen, I suggest we embark on this icy endeavour.

139
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:58,300
Decisions, decisions, decisions.

140
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:01,580
An inevitable and somewhat necessary part of our lives,

141
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:05,020
we often make decisions with mind to direct consequences.

142
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:09,260
However, as the famous historical documentary Back to the Future demonstrated,

143
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:14,700
certain decisions and actions yielded by them can have unforeseen long-term repercussions

144
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,020
that may alter the course of history.

145
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:21,100
When it comes to Club Penguin, we can all likely determine the approximate moment

146
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:24,220
where the cracks in a seemingly solid foundation began to show,

147
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:27,100
but in a way, its destiny had been set long before then,

148
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:30,300
and cemented by a certain, well, acquisition.

149
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:33,500
One piece of information that you might be interested to hear is that

150
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,380
Club Penguin was solely financed by its founders.

151
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:39,900
They had the full 100% share of the game,

152
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:45,020
and they had retained that until 2007, when a very prestigious company entered the picture.

153
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,740
Let's talk about Disney.

154
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:49,500
Oh, Disney, Disney.

155
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,500
Who doesn't love Disney?

156
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,460
Well, me.

157
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:55,820
And it's not that I don't love Disney because I'm not a fan of their creative output.

158
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:59,740
In fact, I would be more than happy to argue that they have pioneered multiple pieces

159
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:03,900
of culturally defining content which justifies their beloved reputation.

160
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:07,820
However, at the same time, I don't think a corporation's reputation

161
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:10,380
should be solely shaped by their media offerings.

162
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,620
I'm aware that makes me no fun at parties,

163
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:15,340
so don't invite me to them if that's a problem for you.

164
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:18,140
But the magic wore off on me a long time ago,

165
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:22,140
and as the fairy dust settled, all I saw was another profit-driven shell,

166
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:24,860
devoid of whatever spirit it used to possess.

167
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:28,220
With that said, in spite of my own personal opinion as a business,

168
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:31,180
they likely did have a lot of resources to offer,

169
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:35,100
so when they approached the Club Penguin co-creators in 2007,

170
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:40,460
with a pretty hefty $350 million sum, an abundance of industry experience,

171
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:44,060
and state-of-the-art infrastructure for Club Penguin's emergent company,

172
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:48,220
New Horizon Interactive, later renamed to Disneyland Studios Canada,

173
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:51,180
it would have been hard for our founding friends to say no to them.

174
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:55,740
In interviews, Club Penguin co-founder Layne Marrifield seemed rather thrilled at the time,

175
00:10:55,740 --> 00:11:00,620
stating that negotiations on his end had mostly focused on discussing philosophical values,

176
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:02,460
something close to his heart.

177
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:05,660
Now, I have no doubt that Disney adhered to these requests,

178
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:08,860
they likely invested a lot in the development of the game,

179
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:13,900
provided an exemplary working environment, and assisted growth over the following years.

180
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:19,020
However, as you probably know, this deal wasn't initially worth $350 million,

181
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:21,100
it was actually $700 million.

182
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:25,980
The second $350 million was dependent on growth targets for 2009,

183
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:28,780
growth targets which the team did not reach.

184
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:31,100
In another article documenting this failure,

185
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:34,940
it claimed that statistics reportedly pointed towards a decline in users,

186
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:36,740
and although Disney disputed this,

187
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:41,820
it's a possibility that it may not have provided the buyers with the performance they were hoping for.

188
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:46,500
Now, people sing their high praises for the atmosphere that Disney cultivates.

189
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,260
However, when it comes to expenditure,

190
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:50,980
I've always received the impression that Mickey Mouse over here,

191
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:53,660
in spite of his friendly face, can be quite cutthroat.

192
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:57,780
It recently furloughed roughly half their employees while protecting their bonuses,

193
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:59,460
launching what Disney's great niece,

194
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:02,500
Abigail Disney, into a rather savage Twitter rant.

195
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,580
And although we can discuss their many motives,

196
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:05,820
the point should be clear.

197
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:09,300
They're not really into spending money on other people.

198
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,980
However, with Disney, I feel it doesn't stop there,

199
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:14,620
because many would argue that regardless of the highs and lows,

200
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:17,380
Club Penguin was still generating revenue for Disney,

201
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:21,060
and therefore there was no reason to bring its future into contention.

202
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:23,580
But Disney doesn't operate like that.

203
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:27,220
Disney is one of the fastest evolving companies out there,

204
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:29,300
particularly in the entertainment industry.

205
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:33,380
It's forever changing and it won't waste time holding on to the status quo

206
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:36,540
if it doesn't make them as much money as they could be elsewhere.

207
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:38,060
When Club Penguin was purchased,

208
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:41,820
there were three other online MMOs in operation by Disney.

209
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:44,900
By 2013, they had all been shut down.

210
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:48,300
Club Penguin outlasted its contemporaries impressively,

211
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:51,540
and by 2015, the site still had millions of users.

212
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:53,900
But it clearly was not enough.

213
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,580
It's not just about making profit.

214
00:12:55,580 --> 00:13:01,020
It's about how much and at a point Disney came to the conclusion that it wasn't enough.

215
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:03,700
The corporation had no great sentimental attachment.

216
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,380
The original founders had ceased working with Disney years ago,

217
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:10,620
and the invested resources could easily be allocated into something more fruitful,

218
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:15,900
not to mention the numerous bugs on the game that would develop over such a long period of time.

219
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:21,540
So in 2015, the Disney began the process of slowly diminishing the amount of support for the servers.

220
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,180
They began laying off staff members,

221
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:27,060
closing offices, and discontinuing certain versions and spinoff games.

222
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:29,380
At that point, Disney had played this down,

223
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:32,940
stating that they were just attempting to make the business more efficient.

224
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:37,500
But over time, it seems that these efficiencies weren't enough to make the game lucrative for them.

225
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:41,500
Now, cost cutting is seldom an effective way of revitalizing a game.

226
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,940
It may help you through a financially rough patch,

227
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:46,220
but it won't renew audience interest.

228
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:50,740
With this in mind, it felt like Disney was preparing to gradually usher Club Penguin from the stage

229
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:52,500
that it had occupied for so long.

230
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,220
And over the next couple years, they did just that.

231
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:58,660
Now, there was always unrest in the Club Penguin servers,

232
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:03,100
and the narrative that Disney had ruined Club Penguin had been present for years.

233
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:10,020
However, I feel like most users viewed it as a defiant cry for a bygone era rather than a serious narrative.

234
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:13,260
And at the end of the day, what can one say to it?

235
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:17,780
Well, Club Penguin itself was engineered towards six to 14 year olds,

236
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:21,780
which means you'll inevitably encounter a high turnover of users after a couple years

237
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:27,620
while having to compete with numerous other MMOs and catering to a rapidly changing cultural zeitgeist.

238
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:29,860
Now, Disney was no stranger to evolution,

239
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:33,900
but part of that evolution is about knowing when to phase a brand out,

240
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:39,180
and at some point management came to the conclusion that such time and assets could be invested elsewhere.

241
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,220
I'll say this much.

242
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:42,940
Disney didn't necessarily ruin Club Penguin,

243
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:46,140
but Club Penguin's structure made it much harder to maintain.

244
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:47,620
Disney couldn't keep up with it,

245
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,500
nor did they have the motivation to.

246
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,020
It's a small part of a much greater pitch to them.

247
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:55,340
Their threshold for underperformance is a lot higher than most.

248
00:14:55,740 --> 00:15:02,460
So on January 30th, 2017, it was announced the Club Penguin was to be closing its doors within the next two months.

249
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:04,940
This was met with shock from many in the community,

250
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:08,580
with some even starting a movement to save the site from its assumed fate.

251
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:09,740
But it was all in vain,

252
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:13,620
and after an extravagant last 24 hours where they lifted all restrictions,

253
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:16,220
and users were finally able to tip the iceberg,

254
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:18,580
an integral part of Club Penguin Mythos,

255
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:23,860
the game which had brought so many people childhood joy gracefully bowed out.

256
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:26,460
And that was the end of the story,

257
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:27,100
which is,

258
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:27,500
of course,

259
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,060
what I'd say if this was the end of the story.

260
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:30,660
However,

261
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:32,660
as I'm sure many of you are aware,

262
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:35,380
this was not the end of Club Penguin.

263
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:36,420
In fact,

264
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:39,740
it seems that some people had other plans,

265
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:41,500
Disney included.

266
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:43,540
Let's talk about those plans.

267
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:47,340
Now,

268
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:52,300
I and many others hold the opinion that the definitive Club Penguin ended

269
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,740
on that spring day.

270
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:54,780
However,

271
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:56,740
Disney themselves wouldn't agree.

272
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:57,180
In fact,

273
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:58,420
in their January announcement,

274
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:02,820
they explained their plans to replace the original Club Penguin with a new MMO,

275
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:04,540
Club Penguin Island.

276
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:07,020
It was originally known as Project Super Secret,

277
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:10,660
and teased in the years prior while they were gearing down the original platform.

278
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:11,060
However,

279
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:15,660
its purpose as CP's successor didn't become apparent until Disney's declaration in

280
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,180
early 2017,

281
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:18,460
and in March,

282
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:23,100
it was released practically on the same day to a glorious fanfare.

283
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:30,380
Well,

284
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:31,980
not quite.

285
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:36,580
I suppose this decision may have made sense at the time to the average marketing team,

286
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:41,660
who assumed that dedicated Club Penguin fans were going to flock to its successor on the basis of

287
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:43,020
namesake alone,

288
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:46,340
and they had designed it in a way that would make it more fashionable.

289
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:51,380
It was initially exclusively available on Android and iOS because all

290
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:54,060
the pipsqueaks are on their phones these days.

291
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:54,500
However,

292
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:58,420
Club Penguin fans were more perceptive than Disney gave them credit for,

293
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:03,220
and this overall rather cynical ploy didn't seem to wash with most users of the

294
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,100
original game.

295
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:04,820
In reviews,

296
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:09,740
many called out the game's membership baiting and the lack of features for anyone unwilling to pay

297
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:12,220
the $4.99 a month for the game.

298
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:17,100
A hashtag was even initiated called Not My Club Penguin to allow audiences to

299
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:20,740
express dissatisfaction at Disney's direction with the new app.

300
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:23,140
Many also noted the multiple bugs on launch,

301
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:24,060
the size of the app,

302
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:26,580
and the effect the game would have on slower phones.

303
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:28,540
One particularly chilling comment read,

304
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:33,020
It's no fun when you have to pay $10 a month just to wear clothes.

305
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:33,900
Not entirely true,

306
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,180
but we'll get to that later.

307
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:35,980
Either way,

308
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:39,740
it was the end of days for classic Club Penguin fans.

309
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:45,740
In spite of the overwhelmingly negative reception and its decreed status as a cash

310
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:46,100
grab,

311
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,420
Mickey Mouse pushed on,

312
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:52,500
eventually launching the game on Windows and Mac later that year with running updates and server events.

313
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,780
As a game at that point,

314
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:56,020
it didn't appear particularly egregious.

315
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:57,420
You could do some stuff.

316
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:00,460
It was a pretty standard mobile game on launch,

317
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:02,060
but that was also the failure.

318
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:04,260
Without sounding too sentimental,

319
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:08,820
it has strayed from the original spirit that many users identified with the platform.

320
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:13,380
Disney had been leading Club Penguin down this route since the original purchase,

321
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,900
with their Disney film sponsored themed events,

322
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,220
which, although harmless,

323
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:20,380
did seem to undermine its fantastical tone a little.

324
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:21,060
However,

325
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,780
with Club Penguin Island,

326
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:27,620
they turned it into a mobile app first and a Club Penguin game second.

327
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:29,900
If it was in addition to Club Penguin Online,

328
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:32,940
I doubt people would have complained too much.

329
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,380
As a little side thing,

330
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:36,420
sure, we can make that work,

331
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:38,100
even if it wasn't very good.

332
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:41,460
But it was promoted as the heir to the penguin throne.

333
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:42,460
And when you have that,

334
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:44,460
you have standards to live up to.

335
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:47,180
So, Axel, did you like the game?

336
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:51,260
It was good until I found out that you can only do four fucking things in this game.

337
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:53,260
Besides the quality of the game,

338
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:55,260
Disney completely misread the room.

339
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:58,260
In probably one of the most significant marketing misfires,

340
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:01,660
their release was the equivalent of having a rave at a funeral.

341
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:04,340
Although I'm sure many users weren't exactly grieving,

342
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:08,420
they were disappointed that a game which clearly held a lot of value to many of them,

343
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:12,620
was no longer able to be a part of their lives with non transferable content.

344
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:15,860
And Disney coming in and offering this shoddy substitute,

345
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,060
it was insulting.

346
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:21,860
It's like breaking a priceless Ming China bars and then offering your plastic

347
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,540
plant potters compensation.

348
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:27,900
You need to reach a point where people wouldn't be comparing the two games directly.

349
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:31,300
And the fact that Disney released this when the other version was closing down,

350
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:36,300
a conclusion that the game itself had hyped up makes me question how in touch

351
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,260
they really were.

352
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:42,300
You know you have failed marketing when the shutdown of one game is more important

353
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,900
than the launch of its successor.

354
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:46,940
They were worried that people would forget about it, I guess.

355
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:48,780
But when you release content like this,

356
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:50,900
you'll just make people want to forget about it.

357
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:51,740
With that said,

358
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:53,540
in spite of its troublesome launch,

359
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:57,260
Mei did begin to report over time that the game was gradually improving,

360
00:19:57,260 --> 00:20:01,260
particularly following its launch on PC with a team behind Club Penguin Island

361
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:04,220
being quite connected with the fandom and their concerns.

362
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:08,500
It seems there was a crew who cared a lot about the quality of the game.

363
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,780
This was the hand they were dealt.

364
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:13,100
They were responsible for a game that was getting an incredible amount of upset.

365
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,900
And it's no doubt their hard work was

366
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:19,180
much appreciated by the people who genuinely came to love Club Penguin Island.

367
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:21,900
They actively listened to criticism and they tried to make it better.

368
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,460
Whenever there was a bug or a problem,

369
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:25,340
they did everything in their power to fix it.

370
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:26,380
And despite everything,

371
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:29,940
it seems the Club Penguin employees did everything they could to make those last

372
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:32,020
few months the best experience possible.

373
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:34,700
They did a halloween party, a waddle on party.

374
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,860
They gave everyone free memberships and coins.

375
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:39,740
They added an offline mode with a bunch of cool features and stuff.

376
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,620
They wrapped up the Club Penguin Island story.

377
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:45,380
They did a bunch of mod meetups and game and even released remastered versions

378
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:50,020
of the classic Club Penguin minigames alongside leaking various projects early

379
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:52,900
that they were planning for the game and the whole time they were talking

380
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:55,460
to the fans on Twitter and answering all their questions.

381
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:59,140
Even months after the shutdown, they're still talking to people on the regular.

382
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:03,980
Nonetheless, any seasoned Internet historian will tell you that first impressions matter

383
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:06,980
and the damage had been done with that catastrophic launch.

384
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:09,540
So in spite of attempts to keep it afloat,

385
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:12,820
Club Penguin Island was a flop and in 2018,

386
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:17,300
less than two years after it was released before the puffles had even been added,

387
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,820
like, come on, bro.

388
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:22,980
Disney disbanded the remaining staff at the Club Penguin headquarters in Kelowna

389
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:25,100
and discontinued the game altogether.

390
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:27,060
And I mean, altogether.

391
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,380
Yes, in their announcement,

392
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:32,620
they make it pretty clear that the franchise as a whole was coming to an end.

393
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:37,620
Alongside reports of corporate restructuring and the dissolution of their general video game sector.

394
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,340
In a letter that was subsequently leaked,

395
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:44,180
Disney cited global competition as their justification for the rather abrupt layoffs.

396
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:45,940
Competition from whom exactly?

397
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:47,500
Well, as discussed earlier,

398
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:51,580
there are many other popular games on the interwebs and even games that don't

399
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:53,540
necessarily share the same format,

400
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:55,660
but still managed to reel in your audience.

401
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:59,580
Disney were clearly dissatisfied with the performance of many of their video games

402
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:04,380
and wanted to export future responsibility on that front to the ever reliable EA,

403
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:06,380
otherwise known as Excessive Avarice.

404
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:10,380
Oh, sorry, I mean Electronic Arts, Freudian Slip.

405
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:12,740
However, even with this information,

406
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:15,340
there were a few other thorns in Disney's side.

407
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:18,700
You see, Disney cut costs initially with mind to this.

408
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:23,020
They were completely aware that it wasn't generating the income it once was,

409
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:25,500
but was still creating something worthwhile.

410
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:28,500
Even if Club Penguin Island was rather mediocre,

411
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,140
even after the backlash,

412
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:34,820
surely some users would have settled on it with the knowledge that at the end of the day,

413
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,020
it was Club Penguin.

414
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:39,380
And if the developers were legitimately attentive to people's requests,

415
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:43,420
then coming on board to bring about positive change may be the best response.

416
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:44,820
Let's not forget,

417
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:47,020
Disney had the rights.

418
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:50,620
It's not like you could just clone Club Penguin and put it online yourself.

419
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:52,620
I mean, who would do that?

420
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:59,940
Well, what if I told you there was a way to play the original Club Penguin online

421
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:03,140
with free membership for all users?

422
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:05,140
You would be in disbelief.

423
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:08,660
I am sure, but my friends, you better believe it.

424
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:09,980
And over the following years,

425
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:14,460
these places became a popular refuge for the former Club Penguin fandom.

426
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:17,620
So let's talk about the private service.

427
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:21,420
Now, private servers exist for many games.

428
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:25,380
In fact, they existed for Club Penguin online prior to its cessation.

429
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:26,900
However, as we've observed,

430
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:30,660
it seems that many users weren't actually ready to waddle on.

431
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:34,380
They wanted to hold on to the place where they created these memories,

432
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:36,020
and that was valid.

433
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:39,300
So when word began spreading about these sites where you could do this,

434
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:42,500
that and the other and take advantage of new benefits,

435
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:45,660
which weren't even available on the original Club Penguin,

436
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:49,980
then people understandably pounced at the opportunity to take advantage of that.

437
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:54,660
These private servers weren't direct replicas of the then present day Disney platform,

438
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:56,900
but they appeared to be implementing running updates,

439
00:23:56,900 --> 00:24:00,700
which helped them strive towards the functional and engaging MMO.

440
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:04,100
You're a boy. Yeah, big boy.

441
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,020
Big boy?

442
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:06,380
Oh my, watch this.

443
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:08,220
Watch, I'm gonna make you look like a bitch. Ready?

444
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:10,500
You're a bitch.

445
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,500
Okay, I'm gonna steal your girl.

446
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,580
Whoa, hold on.

447
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:19,460
The alternative which received the most groundswell initially was a server by the name of Club Penguin Rewritten.

448
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:24,500
This was launched a couple weeks after Disney's January announcement and sought to attract disenfranchised

449
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,260
users from the moribund game.

450
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:28,580
Now that's a fun word I should use more.

451
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:31,420
It was based on early generation versions of the site,

452
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:34,980
mostly from the late 2000s to the start of the 2010s.

453
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,500
Around a month after its launch,

454
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,580
they established an item transfer program.

455
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:42,100
However, this was shut down promptly after Disney unearthed this scheme.

456
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:43,260
In spite of this setback,

457
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:46,100
they grew significantly throughout 2017,

458
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:49,220
surpassing 100,000 members after the game's closure,

459
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:52,100
and one million members in around October.

460
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:54,540
These were substantial numbers for a private server,

461
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:57,700
with some creators promoting it as a worthy substitute,

462
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,540
which was faithful to its source material.

463
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:01,460
However, this wasn't the only server,

464
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:02,740
and as the demand grew,

465
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:04,100
the supply followed.

466
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:08,380
Numerous other Club Penguin servers emerged and began running operations similar to

467
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:09,780
Club Penguin Rewritten.

468
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:13,380
They occupied a significant portion of the remaining Club Penguin audience,

469
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:16,020
leaving many to wonder if Disney would respond.

470
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:19,740
Now, Disney did have the option to issue such service with DMCAs,

471
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:21,580
and due to certain interactions,

472
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:25,220
it became quite apparent that the company was aware of their existence.

473
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:30,180
They filed a legal complaint in October 2017 towards Club Penguin Rewritten and their use of the

474
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:32,860
domain clubpenguinrewritten.pw.

475
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:37,100
However, this appeared to be resolved after the site's domain name was changed.

476
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:37,940
When brought up,

477
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:42,980
Club Penguin Rewritten defended their use of Disney's material as nonprofit and educational.

478
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:46,060
Although the educational element is covered under fair use,

479
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:50,580
it would be highly debatable whether their documentation here was transformative enough,

480
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:53,100
and I'd be inclined to side against it.

481
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:56,700
Some also pointed towards advertisements being shown on the site,

482
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:59,180
challenging the nonprofit credentials,

483
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:01,940
though I haven't seen any in my own examination.

484
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:03,740
So why didn't Disney act?

485
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:06,500
Well, if they had succeeded in pulling down these sites,

486
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,460
I doubt it would have done them much good,

487
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:13,340
as it probably would have just made users and moderators more stubborn and alienated the remaining

488
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,460
fans they had.

489
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:17,820
So this may have held them back from being more dogged about it.

490
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:19,580
But one thing was for certain,

491
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:23,060
Disney was going to struggle to win back the lost audience here,

492
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:27,900
and it appeared over time that these private servers had won the battle for the heart of the game and

493
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:30,500
had become extremely powerful in the process.

494
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:33,100
With great power comes great responsibility,

495
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:34,300
and as time transpired,

496
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:38,060
some began to question whether those in charge were properly equipped.

497
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:42,020
Clubhuman Rewritten was hacked and the database was breached by hackers.

498
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:45,780
And do you want to know how bad of a breach it was?

499
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:47,300
Even though it wasn't released publicly,

500
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:49,020
like some other Clubhuman private servers,

501
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:53,820
Clubhuman Rewritten was using a hashing method called MD5.

502
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,500
Basically MD5,

503
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:58,420
what it does is it just like takes a password.

504
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:00,140
If your password is password,

505
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:02,780
it just takes passwords and like encrypts it,

506
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:04,700
even though it's not really encrypting its hashing,

507
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:10,380
but it just jambles up the letters and it makes a really long stretch of text.

508
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:13,420
So let's say I hacked Clubhuman Rewritten a year ago.

509
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:15,140
I could take anybody's password,

510
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:19,100
I could dehash the MD5 hash,

511
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:23,020
and I would get the text of the password plain as day.

512
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:25,100
So if I wanted to hack Cody's account,

513
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:27,900
once I hacked the Clubhuman Rewritten database,

514
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,260
I could just take his password,

515
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:30,500
put it in a website,

516
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:31,460
get the plain text,

517
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:32,740
and then I'd have his password.

518
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:34,180
And if he's stupid,

519
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:36,860
as stupid as he seems he is online,

520
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:39,100
he would use the same password on every website,

521
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:41,580
and I could just hack into every single one of his accounts.

522
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:45,260
And that is why Clubhuman Rewritten was not safe a year ago.

523
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:49,020
When you run a large site in which people have data which they wish to protect,

524
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:51,740
you are in control of a lot of user information.

525
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:53,380
When you're part of a large company,

526
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:58,260
preserving user data is a relative priority that one has the resources to commit to.

527
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:59,460
If you fail to do so,

528
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:01,220
you may lose consumer trust,

529
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:06,060
and you could well be hounded in the media for not having the sufficient protections in place.

530
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:11,420
Large companies like to conduct themselves with a degree of professionalism because business is on the line.

531
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:14,180
This doesn't just mean a load of protections from hackers,

532
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:17,780
but it also means employee culpability if one of them goes rogue.

533
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:20,340
And given the possible future employment repercussions,

534
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:21,660
if a person does do that,

535
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:26,340
generally, people like to respect the privacy of the users they are assigned to safeguard.

536
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:28,500
With bootleg Club Penguin clones,

537
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:31,500
these principles are predominantly a little less prevalent.

538
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:35,100
This doesn't mean that people won't try to guarantee user security,

539
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:37,820
but it means they may struggle for a variety of reasons.

540
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:40,860
Firstly, you need a consistent and accountable workforce.

541
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:43,500
Plenty of people do their work online anonymously.

542
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,420
This is not just anonymous to the user,

543
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:48,100
but this is anonymous to the people they work with as well.

544
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:49,300
Club Penguin Rewritten,

545
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:52,340
as many sites alike, claim to be nonprofits.

546
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:54,460
Some of these sites did this for legal reasons,

547
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:56,220
others likely did it to compete.

548
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:59,500
This meant that you had to rely on good faith volunteers,

549
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:03,940
some of whom you probably didn't know that well and could disappear at any moment.

550
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:08,180
Secondly, such security relies on very advanced technical programming,

551
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:13,220
which once again doesn't seem that many users behind these versions have great experience in.

552
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:14,780
It doesn't mean they're incompetent.

553
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:17,300
No, I'm sure they do a much better job than me,

554
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:19,820
but I'm not the one they need to be worrying about.

555
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:24,780
On three separate occasions between the start of 2017 and the end of 2019,

556
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:27,300
Club Penguin Rewritten experienced cyber attacks,

557
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:31,420
two of which resulted in millions of user data being compromised.

558
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:36,500
As for the staff, well, it's hard enough to run a Discord server with a few thousand members,

559
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,380
let alone an MMO with millions,

560
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:41,540
so I don't plan to rag on the executive staff too much here.

561
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:44,660
But when you present such content under the Club Penguin banner,

562
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:46,500
you have to do the best.

563
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:51,740
It's impossible to ignore the fact that there have been multiple instances involving one or two staff members

564
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:56,900
which has spiralled inconceivably, even leading to the website being offline for over a month.

565
00:29:56,900 --> 00:30:00,780
However, despite all of Club Penguin Rewritten's technical shortcomings,

566
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:05,220
their management, albeit occasionally amateurish, did not seem to act with malice.

567
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:12,220
But it seems the actual reason why the private server is shutting down is because it's simply gotten too big for the people running it to handle.

568
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:19,180
Apparently, it was being run by a group of teenagers who were working on it as a passion project and wanted to learn how to manage an online multiplayer game.

569
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:22,860
I feel that generally speaking, most of them did have good intentions,

570
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:27,420
and if you manage to root out the agitators, then you can run a somewhat functional project.

571
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:34,620
The team did seem to genuinely take an interest in improving their game and did introduce changes and events which reflected this philosophy.

572
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:40,940
They were arguably the most mainstream Club Penguin server, and for what it was, they didn't necessarily do a bad job.

573
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:44,780
They created a place for people who didn't want to be a part of Club Penguin Island,

574
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:48,700
but still wanted to be a part of the community that they had come to know and love.

575
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:51,460
Because Club Penguin was always greater than the game.

576
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:58,100
Club Penguin Rewritten outlived Club Penguin Island, and over the years following its launch, the game persevered.

577
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:00,740
So what happened next?

578
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:05,700
Well, although Club Penguin Rewritten was a platform somewhat true to the spirit of the original,

579
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:12,380
a new brand of server emerged, and one that would eventually become even more popular than that which we've just discussed.

580
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:13,660
That wasn't a good thing.

581
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:15,980
Let us continue, my friends.

582
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:27,220
Private servers are not safe, but that's no surprise.

583
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:33,900
No private server was completely safe for those who wanted to use it, because you're sharing data with the individuals in charge,

584
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:37,900
and allowing it to be opened up to those who may breach that site's security.

585
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:44,100
There was a point where private just became a buzzword, and the truth is that most of these servers had gone pretty public,

586
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:46,220
many under the branding of Club Penguin.

587
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:51,020
However, some resembled the original less than others, and that's where we're going next.

588
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:55,140
Now, I'm no expert when it comes to dealing with assets and that kind of jazz.

589
00:31:55,140 --> 00:32:00,020
What I do know is that for many games, you will typically find ways to switch up with the power of mods.

590
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:06,540
Mods, short for modifications, are typically alterations implemented by players which change aspects of the game,

591
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:11,860
typically with the intent of enhancing a game's entertainment value and providing a little more variety.

592
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:18,260
Mods play a significant role in many online communities, particularly people who find the regular game a little too vanilla,

593
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:19,900
even if it's Club Penguin.

594
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:23,980
Some people just want a modded game where they can feel like they're playing God.

595
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:26,180
On principle, I don't have a problem with that.

596
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:29,540
Modded games are fairly standard and unexceptional.

597
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:37,020
However, what if a modded server decided that they wanted to compete with the mainstream servers and present itself as a viable market

598
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:39,460
alternative to the original Club Penguin?

599
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:41,140
Okay, a bit chaotic.

600
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:49,300
How about that modded server decide to partake in various underhanded tactics to advance their status and their profit within the community?

601
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:54,380
Wait, what? Yeah, let's talk about Virtual Penguin.

602
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:57,380
Shut down. So yeah, it's hit a lot of people.

603
00:32:57,380 --> 00:33:00,980
We're going to be checking a private server called Virtual Penguin.

604
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:05,620
You may have seen this from my fifth YouTube anniversary video of people advertising this.

605
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:07,060
Well, I didn't even know what it was back then.

606
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:11,220
I thought it was like some type of hacking thing to let you have a membership.

607
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:14,740
But then I looked it up on YouTube and it's actually a private server.

608
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:16,340
So this is actually really cool.

609
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:21,420
Virtual Penguin was a modded server once again established before Club Penguin's demise.

610
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:24,260
However, with the news that Club Penguin was closing its doors,

611
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:32,740
the lads over at Virtual Penguin saw an opportunity to set up a bot to advertise their server with the hope of attracting users in search of another option.

612
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:35,780
They probably garnered a fair through patrons through this method.

613
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,460
However, it was not enough.

614
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:42,220
And with other servers pulling a user base, they decided they wanted to up the ante a little.

615
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:43,820
What did this entail?

616
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:47,740
In the post titled Warning, don't use Virtual Penguin,

617
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:54,340
they mentioned that the team behind Virtual Penguin was hacking other Club Penguin private servers and banning everyone on them.

618
00:33:54,340 --> 00:34:01,740
This was most likely in order to block people out of their accounts in the other private servers so that they'd sign up to Virtual Penguin instead as an alternative.

619
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:06,340
Here's a screenshot of Anthony, who I'm pretty sure is the person in charge of Virtual Penguin,

620
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:12,940
rallying up his team in the DMs and announcing that they're going to kill Super CPPS, another private server.

621
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:16,860
So these guys weren't just trying to innocently grow and promote their website.

622
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:21,460
They were trying to monopolize the game by killing off the competition.

623
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:23,260
What do you mean you chill with them?

624
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:27,140
Wasn't your philosophy more users equals more money?

625
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:30,020
We must eradicate Super CPPS.

626
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:31,540
Then one of his minions pipes up.

627
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:33,540
I want to take down CPR.

628
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:40,060
That's Club Penguin rewritten, which pretty much was and still is the biggest Club Penguin private server out there.

629
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:42,260
Anthony responds, we can't.

630
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:43,340
Not yet anyway.

631
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:45,020
And Timmy's like, why?

632
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:48,820
And to that, Anthony responds, why not build our empire?

633
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:53,300
I'd like to remind you that he's talking about a Club Penguin private server.

634
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:57,700
Why not build our empire by conquering the weaker CPPSs first?

635
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:00,860
You say you're able to take down Super CPPS.

636
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:03,340
So let's fuck their shit up.

637
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:05,980
Wow, I feel like I'm reading Game of Thrones.

638
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:13,500
Yes, in a video by gaming YouTuber Tamago, he documents how a moderator by the name of Anthony was targeting competing services,

639
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:19,100
with the intent to jeopardize their business while offering a much more stable, useful service himself.

640
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:25,300
It was a rather maniacal maneuver, but some may find it a bit drastic, given that it's, well, Club Penguin.

641
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:26,620
It doesn't stop there, though.

642
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:29,020
Following Tamago's reporting on the situation,

643
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:34,700
Anthony ordered the hacking of Tamago's Snapchat before sending explicit content to his contacts,

644
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:37,700
and joining Tamago's Discord server to brag about it.

645
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:42,060
A rather bizarre situation, and yet it doesn't even end there.

646
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:43,900
It's only the start.

647
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:44,740
I can't log in.

648
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:49,300
I go check my email, three emails in a row from Team Snapchat.

649
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:52,700
First one says there was a login attempt from an iPhone X.

650
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:55,260
I do not have an iPhone X.

651
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:58,700
Second one says my password was changed.

652
00:35:58,700 --> 00:35:59,700
By who?

653
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:07,020
Third one says the login authentication app was enabled, so at this point, I'm like, okay, I have been pwned.

654
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:09,100
Yeah, that's weird, I didn't send anything.

655
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:09,940
What did it say?

656
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:14,700
He's like, well, yeah, so the message said,

657
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:17,420
f*** all you gentlemen.

658
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:18,180
Dick pic.

659
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:21,580
So there were three supposed people involved in the incident.

660
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:28,100
One of them, called Jacko, posted a couple of screenshots to show that they were indeed logged into my Snapchat account.

661
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:33,580
While another one, the one who claimed to be Anthony, although his name on Discord was Riley,

662
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:39,100
wrote that he had created evidence of me asking fans for explicit images,

663
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:43,020
and that he had sent this evidence to Keemstar.

664
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:48,500
Now, Aaron, another moderator on my Discord server, asked them why they hacked my account,

665
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:55,380
and Riley, who again is supposedly the real Anthony, posted my video talking about Club Penguin private servers.

666
00:36:55,380 --> 00:37:00,740
So this was apparently a revenge hacking, which I don't think was justified,

667
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:03,700
because in that video, I wasn't even making fun of anybody.

668
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:09,700
I was more so just laughing at the fact that there was drama in the Club Penguin community to begin with.

669
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:14,380
In Tamago's first video on this matter, he states that as recording, Virtual Penguin was defunct.

670
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:18,580
However, they had merely rebranded and adopted a more mainstream Club Penguin approach.

671
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:23,420
Anthony, or as other people know him as Riley, was still very much active within the community,

672
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:26,300
this time on the craftily named Club Penguin Online.

673
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:30,300
Now, Club Penguin Online was once again a place with fewer constraints,

674
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:34,220
and with the new lockdown measures forcing many people to spend more time inside,

675
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:39,900
a lot of individuals, including those of the younger generation, decide to spend more time with online games.

676
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:45,580
This led to media outlets and YouTubers flocking to farm the new epic headline of Club Penguin being back,

677
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:47,900
with differing degrees of accuracy.

678
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:54,220
This Evening Standard article claims that the game was relaunched by Penguin Club's creators.

679
00:37:54,220 --> 00:38:02,060
They called it Penguin Club, which suggests to me that these articles were written hastily as a way to gather views and clicks,

680
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:05,980
rather than as the result of any genuine journalistic motivation.

681
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:12,980
This caused a surge in Club Penguin Online's traffic, as many people were probably looking at how to play Club Penguin Online,

682
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:15,900
and that led them to Club Penguin Online.

683
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:22,540
There is the trickery, and by April 2020, Club Penguin Online was the most actively used Club Penguin,

684
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:24,740
with over seven million members.

685
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:31,740
However, Club Penguin Online was no Club Penguin, and with a more laissez faire approach to what it deemed as suitable content,

686
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:37,620
it inevitably led to a bit of a shock for children who signed up, under the impression that this was similar to the original.

687
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:45,740
In a rather ironically amusing yet unnerving article by the BBC, they chronicle some of the interactions that a BBC reporter had on the site.

688
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:51,540
Some of the examples illuminated the BBC's boomeristic nature, but others did raise legitimate concern,

689
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:56,100
and probably shouldn't be anywhere near content with the Club Penguin name attached to it.

690
00:38:56,500 --> 00:39:00,780
There's tons of swearing, and almost all conversations end up about sex.

691
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:04,300
There's even penguin-y sex, basically sexting.

692
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:07,740
There's also some pretty toxic chat and b******.

693
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:10,740
I saw some horrible antisemitism and racism.

694
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:16,580
At one stage, I was invited to someone's igloo, which had been decorated by spelling out the N-word in chairs.

695
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:22,220
Now, as I understand, there were certain boundaries between the mature sections and the more universal areas.

696
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:28,180
However, these borders were not enforced, and although it's impossible to stop younger children from playing more mature games,

697
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:36,500
maybe publicly marketing a mature version of a children's game and making it fully accessible alongside the moderated version is a bad idea,

698
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:38,980
particularly considering the target demographic.

699
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:43,220
It is antithetical to the reason that the game was made in the first place.

700
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:47,060
You're kind of letting that greasy old man play with the kids in the jungle gym.

701
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:51,220
It's a bit suspect, and I'm not trying to imply anything here about its creator,

702
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:57,460
but yes, it appears our friend Riley was up to a little more than hacking people's snapchats.

703
00:39:57,460 --> 00:40:02,340
Now, he had been reported this all the way back in 2018 with corroborating evidence.

704
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:07,740
However, these posts hadn't stopped him at the time, and they continue to behave in rather reprehensible fashion.

705
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:13,260
It appeared that as the owner of Club Penguin Online and the individual with control over the staff in the game,

706
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:19,260
he was surrounded and enabled by people who were more concerned about personal status than the safety of their users.

707
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:26,100
Nonetheless, one thing that the existing allegations highlighted was that Riley's actions were reckless and done with the brazen attitude

708
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:30,180
of someone who thought he could get away with everything, and for a while he did.

709
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:37,620
However, eventually someone's gonna realize the futility of power in the world of Club Penguin and turn on you with actual consequences.

710
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:44,420
And in 2020, with the spike of interest in Club Penguin Online, one former member decided that he had enough.

711
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:51,460
Today I'm making this video because I want the world to know what Club Penguin Online is doing,

712
00:40:51,460 --> 00:41:00,180
what the owner of that game is doing, and the evil, the sickening, the disgust that that community has,

713
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:02,980
and that is hiding from you, the user.

714
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:09,460
With this video came a domino effect which would bring about the apocalypse for online Club Penguin content.

715
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:22,620
Joey Hughes was a former moderator for Club Penguin Online, where he was known as Twix and a few other pseudonyms to boot.

716
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:27,580
He claims to have left when he had enough of the system that Club Penguin Online and its owner were operating.

717
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:35,100
However, upon his departure in October 2019, screenshots show the CPO team had attempted to smear Twix's reputation,

718
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:38,020
implying that he had been sacked for inappropriate behavior.

719
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:42,860
He had defended himself in a Reddit thread at the time, but it appears that come 2020,

720
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:47,780
he was no longer comfortable with the authority of this website and sought to take it down.

721
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:52,260
Over the space of three videos, he shows evidence and provides in-depth testimony,

722
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:56,380
which not merely paints Riley as being a malicious hacker and all-round megalomaniac,

723
00:41:56,380 --> 00:42:02,900
but also as a predator and someone who used his power to bargain for various explicit content from people who were not of age,

724
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:04,900
and then proceeding to brag about it.

725
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:10,540
On top of this, he talks about the support system in place and the corrupted colleagues that Riley surrounds himself with

726
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:13,540
for the pursuit of that sweet, sweet Club Penguin Moolah.

727
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:16,100
My Club Penguin Online is the biggest server out there.

728
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:22,140
There is no server that has as many active users, as many registered users as Club Penguin Online,

729
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:29,260
and it's very scary knowing that someone like Riley, someone that is a sick-minded and evil as Riley, owns the server.

730
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:32,460
It's hard to think of much to say about this situation, really.

731
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:35,180
It was basically a Club Penguin Mafia.

732
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:40,300
People were being doxxed, harassed, hacked, sites were being de-doxed, all of which created a cycle.

733
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:44,860
When Club Penguin Online gathered traction, more people wanted to be a part of the action.

734
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:51,940
This led people reaching out to Riley for roles on the servers, which would allow Riley to solicit inappropriate content in exchange for these ranks.

735
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:55,700
This led to a more expansive workforce, and more people to do his bidding,

736
00:42:55,700 --> 00:43:02,900
many of which included attacking other competing sites and owners, which inevitably led to greater momentum for their own server,

737
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:07,020
bestowing Riley with even more power, allowing the sequence to continue.

738
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:13,020
The screenshots that you're seeing right now is from 16-year-old Chloe, which is one of his more recent exes,

739
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:22,620
basically telling me that Riley asked for food, she sent him food, and she, in return, got admin.

740
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:31,020
Now, I want you guys to know that anyone under the age of 18 in both the United Kingdom and in America is considered a minor.

741
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:34,220
Chloe is 16, Riley is 20 years old.

742
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:35,820
And what if you wanted out?

743
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:41,820
Well, it turns out that sending explicit content to a person not known for his integrity probably wasn't the best idea,

744
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:44,820
and even if you didn't, it appears that you were not safe.

745
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:48,620
But the only reason why I stayed silent was because Riley had my personal information.

746
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:51,820
He had my address, he had my phone number, he had photos of me.

747
00:43:51,820 --> 00:44:00,220
So he had information on me, and he threatened me that if I spoke out against him, if I told anyone what was going on,

748
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:03,020
that he would swap me, and he would make my life hell.

749
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:09,020
Riley had control in the places that mattered, and in the world of Club Penguin behaved like a kingpin.

750
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:11,420
And what is a pimp without the ladies?

751
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:15,620
Back for you. If you send n****s to Riley, he will give you admin in return.

752
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:20,020
That's what happened with Chloe, that's what happened with Vale, that's what happened with Sydney,

753
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:24,020
that's what happened with tons of other staff members that just kind of randomly popped out of nowhere,

754
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:25,620
and no one knows where the hell they came from.

755
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:30,620
Riley is also a big, big advocate on e-dating.

756
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:33,620
Riley loves to date young girls online.

757
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:39,620
He dates minors, he dated Vale, who was a minor, he dated Sydney, who was a minor,

758
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:45,620
Chloe, who was a minor, and currently this girl named Mariam, who just recently they got a Club Penguin wedding.

759
00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:50,620
So congratulations guys on your underage wedding, I'm happy for you guys.

760
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:53,620
You'll have to forgive me for feeling a little nauseous.

761
00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:58,220
But regardless, given the server's success, it generated a serious amount of income,

762
00:44:58,220 --> 00:45:04,120
allowing Riley to take his predatory tendencies to the next level, allegedly visiting some of his e-girls.

763
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:08,620
From former colleagues to rival websites, Riley directed a trail of destruction,

764
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:13,220
despite actually having no discernible hacking or coding skills of his own.

765
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:17,620
He had the power, he had the goals, and that was all that mattered to him.

766
00:45:17,620 --> 00:45:24,620
This server is a threat. We have allowed this man, this sick individual, to have this much power,

767
00:45:24,620 --> 00:45:32,620
the money that he is making, he is using to have people hacked, he is paying hackers to do these horrible things.

768
00:45:32,620 --> 00:45:37,620
You're giving this man money because the ads that run on his site, he uses.

769
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:41,120
Joey's position as a former staff member who carried out Riley's dirty work,

770
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:44,620
and is only now choosing to call out Club Penguin with their current prestige,

771
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:47,120
could be interpreted as a bit opportunistic.

772
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:53,120
However, the abundance of evidence, and already existent testimony before his video dating back to 2018,

773
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:59,120
heavily supports his point of view, helping this content serve as an additional platform to expose Riley's behaviour.

774
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:04,120
The Club Penguin online crew didn't cover themselves with glory either, regularly concealing incidents,

775
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:10,620
and fabricating resignations, only to allow Riley to still run the ship, a position which he had a stranglehold on.

776
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:14,620
However, it seems that he was losing his grit, and with the publication of Joey's videos,

777
00:46:14,620 --> 00:46:19,620
this evidence began to circulate even more, and although initially not gathering too much recognition,

778
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:24,120
received a signal boost when other large commentary creators began covering the story.

779
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:27,620
It's what seems to be a common theme with everyone who talks about this man,

780
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:31,620
is that anyone who speaks out against him, gets harassed by him.

781
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:37,120
He used to threaten to dox people a lot, whenever, just the slightest little thing that would make him angry.

782
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:43,120
All this evidence of Riley slash Anthony, doing this absolutely revolting thing,

783
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:48,120
the testimony from this girl as well, and the conversations people are having about this man,

784
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:52,620
and it's all a similar theme, makes me believe that something awful has been going on in Club Penguin Online.

785
00:46:52,620 --> 00:47:00,120
This is a huge website with millions of kids on it. I think it absolutely should be investigated by the FBI or some sort of authority.

786
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:04,120
Club Penguin Online themselves did not seem too delighted with the coverage,

787
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:10,120
but instead of attempting to respond to the claims, decided that they were just going to launch a smear campaign against their detractors.

788
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:17,120
Some of this included attacking people like Twix as a doxer, though there seems to be some timeline issues with this comment in particular.

789
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:24,120
This also has the incredibly convincing, I'm Millie, an innocent bystander line, which is actually quite hilarious, so I thank him for that.

790
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:31,120
I've had another deleted post, looked at the evidence, and to be honest, it then becomes very messy, particularly with Joey's own response.

791
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:35,120
I just want everyone to know that me and Kate did date, and, you know, it's a two-year difference.

792
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:43,120
At the time that I dated Kate, I was 19, she was 17, and she was going on 18, so it's a two-year difference, one-year difference, that's legal.

793
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:53,120
And, you know, me and her dated for a little bit, and I dated her all the way until she turned 18, and then after that, we broke up.

794
00:47:54,120 --> 00:48:02,120
And she did send me n****s, and I never screenshotted them, I never, you know, did what Riley did, I never blackmailed her, I never did any of that stuff.

795
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:10,120
But she did send me n****s, but she full willingly sent them to me, we were in a relationship, and she full willingly sent them to me.

796
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:20,120
You know, I did collect n****s from her, but like I said, I never blackmailed her, I never exposed her, I never will do that, this is f***ing horrible, revenge porn is horrible, and I will never do that.

797
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:25,120
I can't appear to you the dude here, because I do understand the nuances in power dynamics, and blackmail.

798
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:33,120
What Riley was doing was much, much, much worse, and isn't really comparable to the actions of a late adolescent couple with equal power and two years between them.

799
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:38,120
However, if you're going to make the argument of legality, you should probably make sure that your hands are clean as well,

800
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:43,120
because otherwise, it brings into question the utilization of that argument for the moral purpose.

801
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:51,120
However, Joey did appear to disprove the notion that he had forcefully obtained any content, and continued to expose their shady behaviour in falsifying claims.

802
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:57,120
Joey also later received an apology from the guy who uploaded the original post on Reddit, which probably explains why it was deleted.

803
00:48:57,120 --> 00:49:06,120
However, I did manage to unearth their formal response, it was terrible, the only thing of interest was a link to a page which was alleged to be the truth page,

804
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:12,120
but unfortunately, that has been lost to the sands of time, though I assume it wouldn't diverge too much from the narrative that we'd seen elsewhere.

805
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:21,120
...claims that people are constantly jealous of them, and are just trying to bring them down, and that jealousy is the main motivator because of how successful their server is.

806
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:28,120
They also say that the screenshots have been debunked, and were blurry photoshopped pictures that have been proved time and time again to be false,

807
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:36,120
and also they claim that this Dominic guy who's exposing them has gone around Discord using Riley's name on a fake account and making up these screenshots.

808
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:45,120
But then we have the chat logs from Club Penguin, Skype conversations, the Discord between the two people that didn't even involve Dominic two years ago talking about Riley's behaviour,

809
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:51,120
staff calling Riley out on his behaviour, there's a lot more evidence that matches up with the story Dominic is telling us.

810
00:49:51,120 --> 00:50:00,120
There are a couple videos about this, but most of their statements just seem like a desperate attempt by Riley and his team to save the floundering reputation of the website.

811
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:08,120
Oh, and one more fun fact, a post reflecting on this was posted to the Drama subreddit, and it was removed by the moderators for causing too much drama.

812
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:11,120
Nice. This is Club Penguin, remember?

813
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:18,120
Yet, in spite of all this absurdity, this was really a detour for only the most engaged in the drama,

814
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:24,120
because truth be told, there was no volume of smear campaigns which could really overturn the weight of the evidence.

815
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:29,120
Only direct counter evidence could do that, and no one seemed to have any.

816
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:35,120
Eventually, Riley's page was removed altogether from the Club Penguin online wiki as if he had never existed,

817
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:39,120
and they attempted to start anew. However, it was a little too late for that.

818
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:46,120
You see, since the exposure of these claims and the accompanying evidence, multiple people had been beseeching Disney to take action.

819
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:50,120
After all, this affair had been operating under their name,

820
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:57,120
and for some people who may not be able to distinguish Club Penguin and their relative clones, they may begin to blame Disney for letting this happen,

821
00:50:57,120 --> 00:51:01,120
subsequently affecting their revenue flow, and Disney wouldn't want that.

822
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:08,120
So on the 15th of May, with the evidence amounting, Disney decided to take action, issuing DMCAs to Club Penguin servers,

823
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:11,120
including Club Penguin Online and Club Penguin Rewritten.

824
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:17,120
Around the same time, an individual involved with Club Penguin Online was also arrested, assumed to be Riley.

825
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:20,120
He was subsequently released on bail pending further charges.

826
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:27,120
At the time, many people chose to celebrate, particularly those who had just been acquainted with this rather sinister situation,

827
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:34,120
and they had reason to. A dangerous individual had been stopped, and many people perhaps saved and liberated in the process.

828
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:39,120
However, for many, this outcome was equally bittersweet, as it marked the end of an era.

829
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:41,120
Where do we go from here?

830
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:55,120
Club Penguin is not back, and Club Penguin is not coming back.

831
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:58,120
When Disney came, they didn't just come for the offending parties,

832
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:04,120
they handed out DMCAs without discrimination towards both Online and Rewritten, causing many other sites to panic as well.

833
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:11,120
This was done under the veil of protecting the children, but if they genuinely cared, they would have done it long before May 2020.

834
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:14,120
In a way, I do wonder why they waited so long.

835
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:20,120
Maybe they do intend to bring Club Penguin back at some point, and thought the private servers would help maintain user interest.

836
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:27,120
After all, they have held on to the rights of the game, so maybe they plan on letting EA develop the next Club Penguin game.

837
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:34,120
Whatever their intent for keeping the game alive was, this situation put them in a position where it would be more beneficial to shut them down.

838
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:38,120
Rather selfish intentions aside, was this the right thing to do?

839
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:44,120
Yes, I suppose. The problem was that these clones needed to be more professional given the users that they were dealing with,

840
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:47,120
and it seemed that they just couldn't handle that responsibility properly.

841
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:52,120
It's a lot of data, it's very vulnerable, and for many young gamers who weren't aware of the technicalities,

842
00:52:52,120 --> 00:53:01,120
if they had logins stored on a poorly protected site, it could easily expose them to individuals who had the intent of breaching the security for less than benign objectives.

843
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:05,120
Kids just see Club Penguin, and won a game.

844
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:12,120
Eventually, some legitimately bad actors emerged, who shouldn't have been anywhere near people's data, especially children's data,

845
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:18,120
and managed to create a successful business model capitalizing on people's nostalgia, while exploiting the power they had acquired from it.

846
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:24,120
But there's a newer command now in the game, and it's called exclamation point gas.

847
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:28,120
And if you execute this command, I'm going to put a screenshot on the screen right now,

848
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:34,120
this command will give you the IP address and the register email of that user.

849
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:42,120
And that is very, very scary, because you have staff members like Epic, staff members like Riley, who run this game,

850
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:49,120
and they have a history of doxxing people, DDoSing people, threatening people with personal information,

851
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:53,120
and it always makes you wonder, how did they get this information?

852
00:53:53,120 --> 00:54:00,120
But if you have commands like this, that are available to staff members, it's very easy for them to run that command,

853
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:07,120
get your IP address, look in a few databases, and figure out who you are, or do an email doxx, and get your information just from your email.

854
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:15,120
And it's very scary knowing that there's children that play this game, you know, that all they have to do is run a command on the username,

855
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:20,120
and the last IP that you logged in with on the game, or you registered with, and the email that you registered with,

856
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:24,120
is all in their hands, just by a single command.

857
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:29,120
It was easy for press investigations to pick apart the flimsy barriers between children's and mature content,

858
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:34,120
and with a director who behaved like a mob boss while indulging in some pretty correctness depravity himself,

859
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:39,120
it was only a matter of time until this behavior was brought to light, it's just a shame it wasn't sooner.

860
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:45,120
With that said, I still feel bad there isn't some sort of compromise, if Disney let these sites exist for years,

861
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:51,120
then what would have stopped them from allowing a verified fan ranked Club Penguin domain to run under their general supervision?

862
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:56,120
However, Disney doesn't seem like one for compromises, it's all or nothing for them often,

863
00:54:56,120 --> 00:55:01,120
and in this instance, as much as I don't like them, the decision was probably right.

864
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:07,120
Disney may well have additional plans for the game in the future because it seems they never went out of their way to antagonize their audience,

865
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:11,120
but when the times seem right, they decide they had more to lose by not taking action.

866
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:17,120
Smaller private servers will probably continue to exist, and maybe some new platforms will arise once more,

867
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:21,120
but with the current precedent set, their long term survival can hardly be guaranteed.

868
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:24,120
It's a shame, but good things seldom last forever.

869
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:30,120
Upon writing, Club Penguin Rewritten's site is still accessible, but apparently a large majority of the staff have since quit,

870
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:34,120
with other allegations from a mystery account surrounding their conduct too.

871
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:39,120
Though it looks like they are intending to continue operations, it's hard to provide an enthusiastic endorsement.

872
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:44,120
Maybe they've decided to call Disney's bluff, and I wish them luck on that front.

873
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:49,120
As for Club Penguin Online, well, their domain is down with a rather obstinate message in its place,

874
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:53,120
claiming the YouTubers who reported on the situation were paid off. Charming.

875
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:57,120
Club Penguin has always thrived on the sentiment of community,

876
00:55:57,120 --> 00:56:01,120
and with many of these servers, I feel that was people's intent.

877
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:04,120
They wanted to hold on to something that they didn't feel they deserved to lose.

878
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:08,120
When Disney shut down the original site in rather ruthless fashion,

879
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:12,120
people weren't ready to move on, and certainly not with what Disney offered in its place.

880
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:18,120
There was always discussion of a successor for the original Club Penguin, given the accumulating bugs and complications,

881
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:23,120
but the successor needed to feel like Club Penguin, and Club Penguin Island just didn't.

882
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:28,120
RuneScape, for example, in spite of their new releases, generally keeps the map true to the original,

883
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:32,120
and has maintained a separate server called Old School RuneScape,

884
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:36,120
and it's commonly reported that the Old School server performs better than the new one.

885
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:40,120
You need to be sensitive to your audience's loyalty to a particular formula.

886
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:44,120
Disney underestimated people's ability to hold on to what they had become accustomed to,

887
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:46,120
and what they would do to maintain that.

888
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:50,120
The new sites were a defiant response to the closure of the original Club Penguin,

889
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:55,120
and at first, they did serve as a way for the community members to hold on to what they enjoyed.

890
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:59,120
A tight-knit community focused on their love of the game can typically self-govern quite well,

891
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:03,120
but as the months and years elapsed, it grew into its own market,

892
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:06,120
and when you have a market with real money involved,

893
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:09,120
you may not attract people with the community's interests at heart.

894
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:14,120
That's why we have checks and balances, particularly when younger and more vulnerable users are involved.

895
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:19,120
Unfortunately, some individuals were not accountable to the degree that many would deem acceptable,

896
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:22,120
and this exploitation of power spiraled out of control,

897
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:27,120
creating a cycle and subsequent chain reaction of events leading us to where we are today.

898
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:32,120
Club Penguin would never go quietly, but sometimes we should worry less about letting go,

899
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:34,120
and more about who may grab a hold.

900
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:40,120
And therefore, no matter how well-intentioned the owner of a private server may be,

901
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:44,120
they cannot be trusted to safeguard your personal information.

902
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:46,120
Keep in mind that whenever you sign up to these websites,

903
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:49,120
you don't only give them your email address and your password,

904
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:55,120
but you also give them access to your IP address, and with your IP address, you can be located.

905
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:58,120
So before you sign up to these websites, you've got to ask yourself,

906
00:57:58,120 --> 00:58:01,120
do I trust these people with my information?

907
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:05,120
We spent a lot of time looking back at all these problems,

908
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:09,120
and for a moment, at least at the end, I think it's fair we look forward.

909
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:14,120
In 2018, when the remaining Club Penguin staff at the Kelowna office were dismissed,

910
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:19,120
with the detached letter from the faceless Disney Corp, a certain man reached out to them,

911
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:22,120
Lane Merrifield, one of the original creators of Club Penguin.

912
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:28,120
He shared a message of solidarity and offered these soon-to-be redundant workers a drink at their local bar

913
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:29,120
to talk it over.

914
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:33,120
The moral was plain, though. It can be hard to let go of what you've come to know,

915
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:38,120
but when one door closes, another will open, the sun will come up, the seasons will change,

916
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:42,120
and there'll be something to move on to, even if it doesn't seem like it at the time.

917
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:48,120
For example, one of Lane's co-bounders, Lance Pribb, has been working on a new game, Box Critters.

918
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:53,120
I haven't played it myself, but it appears to be what I would brand as a true spiritual successor.

919
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:57,120
It feels as if it was being made with the ethos that the original Club Penguin offered.

920
00:58:57,120 --> 00:59:00,120
There were a lot of stylistic similarities as well.

921
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:06,120
If Club Penguin Island was Rollercoaster Tycoon World, Box Critters is Planet Coaster, gamer reference.

922
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:09,120
So if you feel disaffected from the community due to the recent drama,

923
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:14,120
yet still want to be a part of something in the same vein, maybe you'll find something there.

924
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:18,120
If not, that's okay too. Maybe the original is irreplaceable to you.

925
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:22,120
Maybe you just need a break. I know I do.

926
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:26,120
The point remains, as long as people like Lance and Lane are still around,

927
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:30,120
the spirit of Club Penguin will endure, in whatever form it takes,

928
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:35,120
and even though its current state may be disappointing, there's always something to take forward,

929
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:37,120
and I think people will find that.

930
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:42,120
All this time spent trying to recreate what Club Penguin was,

931
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:47,120
when in actuality, the real Club Penguin was inside us all along,

932
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:50,120
but that version isn't playable, so who cares?

933
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:53,120
When did Club Penguin die?

934
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:59,120
Some will say 2017, some will say 2018, some will say 2020, some will say that it's still alive,

935
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:05,120
but its legacy is a complex one which has only seemed to evolve over time, for better and for worse,

936
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:09,120
making people wonder, when should one truly walk along?

937
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:14,120
So yes, that was the video.

938
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:17,120
Do not have a clue when this one's going to be released, Jesus Christ.

939
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:19,120
What is going on in the world?

940
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:26,120
I have lost my mind, but we are persevering, and I will continue to persevere.

941
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:30,120
Sometimes, that's all we can do.

942
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:35,120
I want to give a big thanks to my editors, once again, they've done a great job.

943
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:38,120
Go and check them out, send them some love.

944
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:40,120
I don't know what I'd do without them.

945
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:44,120
I also want to give a big thanks to my patrons at the time of recording.

946
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:47,120
There's some $10 patrons up on the board right now.

947
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:54,120
I also have to give a big thanks to the $50 patrons, Amanda, Caroline, Devon, Hypercube,

948
01:00:54,120 --> 01:00:57,120
some hullabaloo, and that's it.

949
01:00:57,120 --> 01:01:02,120
I also want to give big thanks to my $100 patrons, Brandon Junk, Christopher Carrasse,

950
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:05,120
Yesenia Ramirez, and Candy Skulls.

951
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:07,120
Thank you very much, guys.

952
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:09,120
Your support is much appreciated.

It makes a great difference.

954
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:13,120
I don't really have too much else to add.

955
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:16,120
I'll probably be heading out now because I finally cracked.

956
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:21,120
Oh, if you want to follow me on social media, they'll be in the pinned comment below too.

957
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:24,120
So yeah, that's about it, though.

958
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:26,120
I'm probably going to leave now.

959
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:32,120
So, I'm The Right Opinion, and I will see you guys in the next one.

960
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:36,120
Okay, okay, I'll go.

961
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:39,120
Troy, where's the door handle?

962
01:01:39,120 --> 01:01:41,120
Wait, what are you wearing?

963
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:50,120
Oh no.

964
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:56,120
Oh no.
