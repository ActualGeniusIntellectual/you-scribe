0	6820	Now I'm sure a lot of you remember Club Penguin from your childhood, a game played by millions
6820	8580	of kids around the world.
8580	12300	So as a lot of you might know, the popular kids website Club Penguin announced that they
12300	15180	will be shutting down on the 29th of March this year.
15180	16180	This was a mistake!
16180	17180	Ahhh!
17180	18180	No Club Penguin, please don't do this!
18180	19180	Why don't you do it?
19180	20180	It's a reality game!
20180	21180	This is a-
21180	26620	A lot of people are, as you may have noticed, not too happy about this, but unfortunately
26620	28860	the people behind this don't really care.
28860	33280	The mobile and desktop versions of the game will be shut down in order to allow the team
33280	36340	to focus their efforts on Club Penguin Island.
36340	40100	So basically you may have heard the news that Club Penguin Island is shutting down.
40100	45020	Club Penguin Island had an incredibly short lifespan for an online multiplayer game.
45020	47940	The original Club Penguin experience no longer existed.
47940	49460	So where did things go wrong?
58860	66860	When did Club Penguin die?
66860	69340	A simple question with a simple answer.
69340	70340	Yes?
70340	71820	Well, perhaps not.
71820	76340	Hello, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with
76340	80600	too much free time, but this time isn't just any time.
80600	83420	Once again, it's gamer time.
83420	84860	That's right, you heard me correctly.
84860	88840	We are going back to the gaming corner of YouTube, because as I have proven time and
88840	94100	time again, I am a gamer, and today we are looking at an online MMO, which some would
94100	98220	argue is unrivaled in the gamer spirit that it has fostered.
98220	102380	Now you may have suspected an undertone of irony there, but don't be fooled, my friends,
102380	107140	because back in the golden days when The Right Opinion was a young lad full of zest and zeal,
107140	110660	there were three games which shaped his early online experience.
110660	116140	Those being RuneScape, Neopets, and the topic of interest today, Club Penguin.
116140	120020	I can't remember which order I played them in exactly, though I could take an educated
120020	124060	guess, but I still remember them fondly for being able to capture sentiments of wide-eyed
124060	128780	wonder and imagination that seemed far beyond my grasp these days, and I know this wasn't
128780	130500	just a personal experience.
130500	135060	I'm sure many of you reminisce to a time where such avenues felt like a genuine escape to
135060	136060	a different world.
136300	141460	However, as time has progressed, so have we, and such memories fade into the background
141460	142780	of a distant past.
142780	146860	Nonetheless, I find some consolation in the thought that if I ever wanted to attempt to
146860	152460	emulate that escapism again, those sites are, as of right now, ready and waiting to welcome
152460	153460	me home.
153460	156060	Well, all except Club Penguin.
156060	159060	Yes, Club Penguin, an abandoned abode.
159060	163540	Their tragic demise seemed intangible to many, for a site which had once boasted over 200
163540	166340	million registered users, and 30 million active users.
166340	170340	However, its last few years have been played by drama and conflict, eventually culminating
170340	172020	in rather cataclysmic fashion.
172020	176900	For those who are unfamiliar, Club Penguin, sometimes abbreviated to CP, was an online
176900	181340	game in which your character could take the form of a penguin, and participate in various
181340	186800	activities all over this online world, full of many other colourful, fluffy characters
186800	189620	controlled by very real other users.
189620	194020	As a child, it taught you the ropes of online safety, and interpersonal friendships.
194020	198220	It had some pretty fun games too, and for the young mind, Club Penguin helped prepare
198220	202980	individuals for what the internet was going to throw at us, which is an ever more important
202980	208380	learning curve in today's society, yet in spite of its supposed relevance, it no longer
208380	214620	plays a prominent part in the online sphere, and today we'll be finding out how that happened.
214620	219220	However, to understand its end, we do need to go back to the beginning, and maybe ride
219220	223460	a little background for anyone who never had the privilege to roleplay online as a
223460	226900	virtual bird, unless you're one of those avians, of course.
226900	229540	However, I think it's time to bring in a friend.
229540	234420	Now, if you're familiar with today's guest, you may have recently seen me pull off a legendary
234420	237020	voice performance on one of his newest videos.
237020	238620	Well, book him, boys.
238620	242620	Oh, you f**king muck! F**k you!
242620	247020	I'm gonna f**k take you down to Tardis Head!
247020	253180	Normally, I charge for such convincing characterisation, however, his payment was merely his undying
253180	255100	love and this feature.
255100	261340	Ladies and gentlemen, talking about the origins of Club Penguin, I present to you, the internet historian.
263900	267500	Ah, thank you, thank you, real applause, thank you.
268380	273340	Here we are at the Club Penguin, so allow me to break the ice with the story of how
273420	279980	Club Penguin came to be one of the most successful online platforms... ever.
281020	285980	First, I need to introduce you to three men, Lane, Lance, and Dave.
286540	292380	Lance was developing for Dave at New Horizons Productions, where Lane was hired as a sales
292380	295020	representative, so that's how they knew each other.
295580	300140	At this time, Lance would be working on web-based games, though Lance's previous projects had
300140	307020	included the unfinished snowblasters, experimental penguins, penguin chat, penguin football chat,
307020	310140	there's a bit of a trend here, and ballistic biscuit.
310780	315980	One day, while Lane, Dave, and Lance were drinking some Tim Hortons and looking at the
315980	321420	local moose, there's animals fighting in the front lawn, they realised that the current
321420	327340	online market wasn't offering a safe site for kids to socialise in a fun and interactive way.
328220	332940	And that needed to change, in the words of famous philosopher Helen Lovejoy.
336220	340940	So when these three saw the gap in the market and realised the combined power and innovation
340940	347340	they harnessed, they saw a business opportunity, and decided to fuse their energy into one
347340	355420	earth-shattering, world-dominating, universe-ending project known as Penguin Chat 4, soon to be
356380	359180	known as Club Penguin.
359900	363260	Work began in 2004, and the name was picked in 2005.
363260	367740	They used Penguin Chat 2 as a springboard for various prototypes before reaching a
367740	372620	satisfying product, launching the beta test on August 22nd of 2005.
373660	374300	It went well.
375100	376140	Very well.
376140	380380	So well, in fact, that they had a party to trial the server capacity.
380380	382140	Now there's an animal part.
382140	386220	Club Penguin was originally set to release for 2010, but they thought,
386220	388860	solid, and dropped that bad boy in October.
388860	395340	It launched with 15,000 users, but by March 2006 had surged to 1.4 million,
395340	398940	before reaching 2.6 by September in the same year.
399660	400220	Not bad.
400780	404700	And by the two-year anniversary, Club Penguin hit 3.9 million,
404700	406300	despite lacking a marketing budget.
407020	410860	However, this is when the big wigs began to take notice.
410860	414220	The Club Penguin crew had previously turned down a few offers,
414220	417580	but then comes Disney, who represents a pretty large sum of cash,
417580	421340	and strikes a deal with the founders who hand over Club Penguin and their parent company.
421340	423740	Dave, Lance, and Lane stay on to work for the game,
423740	428540	but individually leave the company over the following years to take on new personal projects.
428540	432300	In the years following Disney's acquisition, Club Penguin continued to grow,
432300	436140	launching multiple spin-offs, hosting sponsored events, hiring more staff,
436140	439100	opening new servers, and setting up offices all over the world.
439100	445180	By 2013, Club Penguin had over 200 million registered accounts,
445180	447180	alongside a highly dedicated fandom.
447740	451580	Quite the achievement for what was once a humble indie game conceived by three amigos,
451580	454540	and even more impressive considering they were Canadian.
455340	458140	Everything was going swimmingly for our frosty friends.
458140	460060	However, that would soon change.
460060	461500	To what exactly?
461500	465340	You'll have to find out, after we've spoken about rage.
466380	468220	Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
468300	469740	Excuse me, I would like to finish the ad, please.
469740	471020	They're not paying me this time.
471020	472540	The people deserve to know.
472540	474380	Oh, Jesus Christ, out.
474380	476620	It's about my sheer love for the game.
476620	483660	Out, go, leave, leave, right now, pad it with you, you and your shadow man, bollocks.
483660	484620	It's my turn.
486220	493340	Uh, sorry guys, um, wow, wow, thank you Professor Historian,
493340	498060	I must confess, it is quite the honour to host such a distinguished academic
498060	500300	for this prestigious esteemed topic.
500300	503500	And as my friend has likely depicted, in its first decade,
503500	507820	Club Penguin ascended the ranks and achieved astounding levels of success,
507820	511980	establishing itself as a torchbearer for child-friendly online platforms.
511980	514540	It was something worthy of celebration.
514540	520060	However, come 2016, this was all about to change, and not in a fun way.
521020	526380	So, without further ado, we must now look towards the downturn of Club Penguin,
526380	529820	and the factors that were instrumental in its unfortunate fate.
530620	534780	Ladies and gentlemen, I suggest we embark on this icy endeavour.
535820	538300	Decisions, decisions, decisions.
538300	541580	An inevitable and somewhat necessary part of our lives,
541580	545020	we often make decisions with mind to direct consequences.
545020	549260	However, as the famous historical documentary Back to the Future demonstrated,
549260	554700	certain decisions and actions yielded by them can have unforeseen long-term repercussions
554700	557020	that may alter the course of history.
557020	561100	When it comes to Club Penguin, we can all likely determine the approximate moment
561100	564220	where the cracks in a seemingly solid foundation began to show,
564220	567100	but in a way, its destiny had been set long before then,
567100	570300	and cemented by a certain, well, acquisition.
570300	573500	One piece of information that you might be interested to hear is that
573500	576380	Club Penguin was solely financed by its founders.
576380	579900	They had the full 100% share of the game,
579900	585020	and they had retained that until 2007, when a very prestigious company entered the picture.
585660	587740	Let's talk about Disney.
587740	589500	Oh, Disney, Disney.
589500	591500	Who doesn't love Disney?
591500	592460	Well, me.
592460	595820	And it's not that I don't love Disney because I'm not a fan of their creative output.
595820	599740	In fact, I would be more than happy to argue that they have pioneered multiple pieces
599740	603900	of culturally defining content which justifies their beloved reputation.
603900	607820	However, at the same time, I don't think a corporation's reputation
607820	610380	should be solely shaped by their media offerings.
610380	612620	I'm aware that makes me no fun at parties,
612620	615340	so don't invite me to them if that's a problem for you.
615340	618140	But the magic wore off on me a long time ago,
618140	622140	and as the fairy dust settled, all I saw was another profit-driven shell,
622140	624860	devoid of whatever spirit it used to possess.
624860	628220	With that said, in spite of my own personal opinion as a business,
628220	631180	they likely did have a lot of resources to offer,
631260	635100	so when they approached the Club Penguin co-creators in 2007,
635100	640460	with a pretty hefty $350 million sum, an abundance of industry experience,
640460	644060	and state-of-the-art infrastructure for Club Penguin's emergent company,
644060	648220	New Horizon Interactive, later renamed to Disneyland Studios Canada,
648220	651180	it would have been hard for our founding friends to say no to them.
651180	655740	In interviews, Club Penguin co-founder Layne Marrifield seemed rather thrilled at the time,
655740	660620	stating that negotiations on his end had mostly focused on discussing philosophical values,
660620	662460	something close to his heart.
662460	665660	Now, I have no doubt that Disney adhered to these requests,
665660	668860	they likely invested a lot in the development of the game,
668860	673900	provided an exemplary working environment, and assisted growth over the following years.
673900	679020	However, as you probably know, this deal wasn't initially worth $350 million,
679020	681100	it was actually $700 million.
681100	685980	The second $350 million was dependent on growth targets for 2009,
685980	688780	growth targets which the team did not reach.
688780	691100	In another article documenting this failure,
691100	694940	it claimed that statistics reportedly pointed towards a decline in users,
694940	696740	and although Disney disputed this,
696740	701820	it's a possibility that it may not have provided the buyers with the performance they were hoping for.
702220	706500	Now, people sing their high praises for the atmosphere that Disney cultivates.
706500	708260	However, when it comes to expenditure,
708260	710980	I've always received the impression that Mickey Mouse over here,
710980	713660	in spite of his friendly face, can be quite cutthroat.
713660	717780	It recently furloughed roughly half their employees while protecting their bonuses,
717780	719460	launching what Disney's great niece,
719460	722500	Abigail Disney, into a rather savage Twitter rant.
722500	724580	And although we can discuss their many motives,
724580	725820	the point should be clear.
725820	729300	They're not really into spending money on other people.
729300	731980	However, with Disney, I feel it doesn't stop there,
731980	734620	because many would argue that regardless of the highs and lows,
734620	737380	Club Penguin was still generating revenue for Disney,
737380	741060	and therefore there was no reason to bring its future into contention.
741060	743580	But Disney doesn't operate like that.
743980	747220	Disney is one of the fastest evolving companies out there,
747220	749300	particularly in the entertainment industry.
749300	753380	It's forever changing and it won't waste time holding on to the status quo
753380	756540	if it doesn't make them as much money as they could be elsewhere.
756540	758060	When Club Penguin was purchased,
758060	761820	there were three other online MMOs in operation by Disney.
761820	764900	By 2013, they had all been shut down.
764900	768300	Club Penguin outlasted its contemporaries impressively,
768300	771540	and by 2015, the site still had millions of users.
771540	773900	But it clearly was not enough.
773900	775580	It's not just about making profit.
775580	781020	It's about how much and at a point Disney came to the conclusion that it wasn't enough.
781020	783700	The corporation had no great sentimental attachment.
783700	786380	The original founders had ceased working with Disney years ago,
786380	790620	and the invested resources could easily be allocated into something more fruitful,
790620	795900	not to mention the numerous bugs on the game that would develop over such a long period of time.
795900	801540	So in 2015, the Disney began the process of slowly diminishing the amount of support for the servers.
801540	803180	They began laying off staff members,
803180	807060	closing offices, and discontinuing certain versions and spinoff games.
807060	809380	At that point, Disney had played this down,
809380	812940	stating that they were just attempting to make the business more efficient.
812940	817500	But over time, it seems that these efficiencies weren't enough to make the game lucrative for them.
817500	821500	Now, cost cutting is seldom an effective way of revitalizing a game.
821500	823940	It may help you through a financially rough patch,
823940	826220	but it won't renew audience interest.
826220	830740	With this in mind, it felt like Disney was preparing to gradually usher Club Penguin from the stage
830740	832500	that it had occupied for so long.
832500	835220	And over the next couple years, they did just that.
835620	838660	Now, there was always unrest in the Club Penguin servers,
838660	843100	and the narrative that Disney had ruined Club Penguin had been present for years.
843100	850020	However, I feel like most users viewed it as a defiant cry for a bygone era rather than a serious narrative.
850020	853260	And at the end of the day, what can one say to it?
853260	857780	Well, Club Penguin itself was engineered towards six to 14 year olds,
857780	861780	which means you'll inevitably encounter a high turnover of users after a couple years
861780	867620	while having to compete with numerous other MMOs and catering to a rapidly changing cultural zeitgeist.
867620	869860	Now, Disney was no stranger to evolution,
869860	873900	but part of that evolution is about knowing when to phase a brand out,
873900	879180	and at some point management came to the conclusion that such time and assets could be invested elsewhere.
879180	880220	I'll say this much.
880220	882940	Disney didn't necessarily ruin Club Penguin,
882940	886140	but Club Penguin's structure made it much harder to maintain.
886140	887620	Disney couldn't keep up with it,
887620	889500	nor did they have the motivation to.
889500	892020	It's a small part of a much greater pitch to them.
892020	895340	Their threshold for underperformance is a lot higher than most.
895740	902460	So on January 30th, 2017, it was announced the Club Penguin was to be closing its doors within the next two months.
902460	904940	This was met with shock from many in the community,
904940	908580	with some even starting a movement to save the site from its assumed fate.
908580	909740	But it was all in vain,
909740	913620	and after an extravagant last 24 hours where they lifted all restrictions,
913620	916220	and users were finally able to tip the iceberg,
916220	918580	an integral part of Club Penguin Mythos,
918580	923860	the game which had brought so many people childhood joy gracefully bowed out.
923860	926460	And that was the end of the story,
926460	927100	which is,
927100	927500	of course,
927500	930060	what I'd say if this was the end of the story.
930060	930660	However,
930660	932660	as I'm sure many of you are aware,
932660	935380	this was not the end of Club Penguin.
935380	936420	In fact,
936420	939740	it seems that some people had other plans,
939740	941500	Disney included.
941620	943540	Let's talk about those plans.
946940	947340	Now,
947340	952300	I and many others hold the opinion that the definitive Club Penguin ended
952300	953740	on that spring day.
953740	954780	However,
954780	956740	Disney themselves wouldn't agree.
956740	957180	In fact,
957180	958420	in their January announcement,
958420	962820	they explained their plans to replace the original Club Penguin with a new MMO,
962820	964540	Club Penguin Island.
964540	967020	It was originally known as Project Super Secret,
967020	970660	and teased in the years prior while they were gearing down the original platform.
970700	971060	However,
971060	975660	its purpose as CP's successor didn't become apparent until Disney's declaration in
975660	977180	early 2017,
977580	978460	and in March,
978460	983100	it was released practically on the same day to a glorious fanfare.
989780	990380	Well,
990780	991980	not quite.
992380	996580	I suppose this decision may have made sense at the time to the average marketing team,
996580	1001660	who assumed that dedicated Club Penguin fans were going to flock to its successor on the basis of
1001660	1003020	namesake alone,
1003020	1006340	and they had designed it in a way that would make it more fashionable.
1006340	1011380	It was initially exclusively available on Android and iOS because all
1011380	1014060	the pipsqueaks are on their phones these days.
1014060	1014500	However,
1014500	1018420	Club Penguin fans were more perceptive than Disney gave them credit for,
1018420	1023220	and this overall rather cynical ploy didn't seem to wash with most users of the
1023220	1024100	original game.
1024140	1024820	In reviews,
1024820	1029740	many called out the game's membership baiting and the lack of features for anyone unwilling to pay
1029740	1032220	the $4.99 a month for the game.
1032220	1037100	A hashtag was even initiated called Not My Club Penguin to allow audiences to
1037100	1040740	express dissatisfaction at Disney's direction with the new app.
1040740	1043140	Many also noted the multiple bugs on launch,
1043140	1044060	the size of the app,
1044060	1046580	and the effect the game would have on slower phones.
1046580	1048540	One particularly chilling comment read,
1048540	1053020	It's no fun when you have to pay $10 a month just to wear clothes.
1053020	1053900	Not entirely true,
1053900	1055180	but we'll get to that later.
1055180	1055980	Either way,
1055980	1059740	it was the end of days for classic Club Penguin fans.
1060940	1065740	In spite of the overwhelmingly negative reception and its decreed status as a cash
1065740	1066100	grab,
1066100	1067420	Mickey Mouse pushed on,
1067420	1072500	eventually launching the game on Windows and Mac later that year with running updates and server events.
1072500	1073780	As a game at that point,
1073780	1076020	it didn't appear particularly egregious.
1076020	1077420	You could do some stuff.
1077420	1080460	It was a pretty standard mobile game on launch,
1080460	1082060	but that was also the failure.
1082060	1084260	Without sounding too sentimental,
1084260	1088820	it has strayed from the original spirit that many users identified with the platform.
1088820	1093380	Disney had been leading Club Penguin down this route since the original purchase,
1093380	1095900	with their Disney film sponsored themed events,
1095900	1097220	which, although harmless,
1097220	1100380	did seem to undermine its fantastical tone a little.
1100380	1101060	However,
1101060	1102780	with Club Penguin Island,
1102780	1107620	they turned it into a mobile app first and a Club Penguin game second.
1107620	1109900	If it was in addition to Club Penguin Online,
1109940	1112940	I doubt people would have complained too much.
1112940	1114380	As a little side thing,
1114380	1116420	sure, we can make that work,
1116420	1118100	even if it wasn't very good.
1118100	1121460	But it was promoted as the heir to the penguin throne.
1121460	1122460	And when you have that,
1122460	1124460	you have standards to live up to.
1125260	1127180	So, Axel, did you like the game?
1127180	1131260	It was good until I found out that you can only do four fucking things in this game.
1131260	1133260	Besides the quality of the game,
1133260	1135260	Disney completely misread the room.
1135260	1138260	In probably one of the most significant marketing misfires,
1138300	1141660	their release was the equivalent of having a rave at a funeral.
1141660	1144340	Although I'm sure many users weren't exactly grieving,
1144340	1148420	they were disappointed that a game which clearly held a lot of value to many of them,
1148420	1152620	was no longer able to be a part of their lives with non transferable content.
1152620	1155860	And Disney coming in and offering this shoddy substitute,
1155860	1157060	it was insulting.
1157060	1161860	It's like breaking a priceless Ming China bars and then offering your plastic
1161860	1163540	plant potters compensation.
1163540	1167900	You need to reach a point where people wouldn't be comparing the two games directly.
1167900	1171300	And the fact that Disney released this when the other version was closing down,
1171300	1176300	a conclusion that the game itself had hyped up makes me question how in touch
1176300	1177260	they really were.
1177260	1182300	You know you have failed marketing when the shutdown of one game is more important
1182300	1183900	than the launch of its successor.
1183900	1186940	They were worried that people would forget about it, I guess.
1186940	1188780	But when you release content like this,
1188780	1190900	you'll just make people want to forget about it.
1190900	1191740	With that said,
1191740	1193540	in spite of its troublesome launch,
1193540	1197260	Mei did begin to report over time that the game was gradually improving,
1197260	1201260	particularly following its launch on PC with a team behind Club Penguin Island
1201260	1204220	being quite connected with the fandom and their concerns.
1204220	1208500	It seems there was a crew who cared a lot about the quality of the game.
1208500	1209780	This was the hand they were dealt.
1209780	1213100	They were responsible for a game that was getting an incredible amount of upset.
1213100	1214900	And it's no doubt their hard work was
1214900	1219180	much appreciated by the people who genuinely came to love Club Penguin Island.
1219180	1221900	They actively listened to criticism and they tried to make it better.
1221900	1223460	Whenever there was a bug or a problem,
1223460	1225340	they did everything in their power to fix it.
1225340	1226380	And despite everything,
1226380	1229940	it seems the Club Penguin employees did everything they could to make those last
1229940	1232020	few months the best experience possible.
1232020	1234700	They did a halloween party, a waddle on party.
1234700	1236860	They gave everyone free memberships and coins.
1236860	1239740	They added an offline mode with a bunch of cool features and stuff.
1239740	1241620	They wrapped up the Club Penguin Island story.
1241620	1245380	They did a bunch of mod meetups and game and even released remastered versions
1245380	1250020	of the classic Club Penguin minigames alongside leaking various projects early
1250020	1252900	that they were planning for the game and the whole time they were talking
1252900	1255460	to the fans on Twitter and answering all their questions.
1255460	1259140	Even months after the shutdown, they're still talking to people on the regular.
1259140	1263980	Nonetheless, any seasoned Internet historian will tell you that first impressions matter
1263980	1266980	and the damage had been done with that catastrophic launch.
1266980	1269540	So in spite of attempts to keep it afloat,
1269540	1272820	Club Penguin Island was a flop and in 2018,
1272820	1277300	less than two years after it was released before the puffles had even been added,
1277300	1278820	like, come on, bro.
1278820	1282980	Disney disbanded the remaining staff at the Club Penguin headquarters in Kelowna
1282980	1285100	and discontinued the game altogether.
1285140	1287060	And I mean, altogether.
1287060	1288380	Yes, in their announcement,
1288380	1292620	they make it pretty clear that the franchise as a whole was coming to an end.
1292620	1297620	Alongside reports of corporate restructuring and the dissolution of their general video game sector.
1297620	1299340	In a letter that was subsequently leaked,
1299340	1304180	Disney cited global competition as their justification for the rather abrupt layoffs.
1304180	1305940	Competition from whom exactly?
1305940	1307500	Well, as discussed earlier,
1307500	1311580	there are many other popular games on the interwebs and even games that don't
1311740	1313540	necessarily share the same format,
1313540	1315660	but still managed to reel in your audience.
1315660	1319580	Disney were clearly dissatisfied with the performance of many of their video games
1319580	1324380	and wanted to export future responsibility on that front to the ever reliable EA,
1324380	1326380	otherwise known as Excessive Avarice.
1326380	1330380	Oh, sorry, I mean Electronic Arts, Freudian Slip.
1330780	1332740	However, even with this information,
1332740	1335340	there were a few other thorns in Disney's side.
1335740	1338700	You see, Disney cut costs initially with mind to this.
1338700	1343020	They were completely aware that it wasn't generating the income it once was,
1343020	1345500	but was still creating something worthwhile.
1345500	1348500	Even if Club Penguin Island was rather mediocre,
1348500	1350140	even after the backlash,
1350140	1354820	surely some users would have settled on it with the knowledge that at the end of the day,
1354820	1356020	it was Club Penguin.
1356020	1359380	And if the developers were legitimately attentive to people's requests,
1359380	1363420	then coming on board to bring about positive change may be the best response.
1363420	1364820	Let's not forget,
1365220	1367020	Disney had the rights.
1367020	1370620	It's not like you could just clone Club Penguin and put it online yourself.
1370620	1372620	I mean, who would do that?
1374620	1379940	Well, what if I told you there was a way to play the original Club Penguin online
1380340	1383140	with free membership for all users?
1383140	1385140	You would be in disbelief.
1385140	1388660	I am sure, but my friends, you better believe it.
1388660	1389980	And over the following years,
1389980	1394460	these places became a popular refuge for the former Club Penguin fandom.
1394460	1397620	So let's talk about the private service.
1398580	1401420	Now, private servers exist for many games.
1401420	1405380	In fact, they existed for Club Penguin online prior to its cessation.
1405380	1406900	However, as we've observed,
1406900	1410660	it seems that many users weren't actually ready to waddle on.
1410660	1414380	They wanted to hold on to the place where they created these memories,
1414380	1416020	and that was valid.
1416020	1419300	So when word began spreading about these sites where you could do this,
1419300	1422500	that and the other and take advantage of new benefits,
1422540	1425660	which weren't even available on the original Club Penguin,
1425660	1429980	then people understandably pounced at the opportunity to take advantage of that.
1429980	1434660	These private servers weren't direct replicas of the then present day Disney platform,
1434660	1436900	but they appeared to be implementing running updates,
1436900	1440700	which helped them strive towards the functional and engaging MMO.
1440700	1444100	You're a boy. Yeah, big boy.
1444100	1445020	Big boy?
1445020	1446380	Oh my, watch this.
1446380	1448220	Watch, I'm gonna make you look like a bitch. Ready?
1448220	1450500	You're a bitch.
1451500	1452500	Okay, I'm gonna steal your girl.
1452500	1453580	Whoa, hold on.
1453980	1459460	The alternative which received the most groundswell initially was a server by the name of Club Penguin Rewritten.
1459480	1464500	This was launched a couple weeks after Disney's January announcement and sought to attract disenfranchised
1464500	1466260	users from the moribund game.
1466260	1468580	Now that's a fun word I should use more.
1468580	1471420	It was based on early generation versions of the site,
1471420	1474980	mostly from the late 2000s to the start of the 2010s.
1474980	1476500	Around a month after its launch,
1476500	1478580	they established an item transfer program.
1478580	1482100	However, this was shut down promptly after Disney unearthed this scheme.
1482100	1483260	In spite of this setback,
1483260	1486100	they grew significantly throughout 2017,
1486100	1489220	surpassing 100,000 members after the game's closure,
1489220	1492100	and one million members in around October.
1492100	1494540	These were substantial numbers for a private server,
1494540	1497700	with some creators promoting it as a worthy substitute,
1497700	1499540	which was faithful to its source material.
1499540	1501460	However, this wasn't the only server,
1501460	1502740	and as the demand grew,
1502740	1504100	the supply followed.
1504100	1508380	Numerous other Club Penguin servers emerged and began running operations similar to
1508380	1509780	Club Penguin Rewritten.
1509780	1513380	They occupied a significant portion of the remaining Club Penguin audience,
1513380	1516020	leaving many to wonder if Disney would respond.
1516020	1519740	Now, Disney did have the option to issue such service with DMCAs,
1519740	1521580	and due to certain interactions,
1521580	1525220	it became quite apparent that the company was aware of their existence.
1525220	1530180	They filed a legal complaint in October 2017 towards Club Penguin Rewritten and their use of the
1530180	1532860	domain clubpenguinrewritten.pw.
1532860	1537100	However, this appeared to be resolved after the site's domain name was changed.
1537140	1537940	When brought up,
1537940	1542980	Club Penguin Rewritten defended their use of Disney's material as nonprofit and educational.
1542980	1546060	Although the educational element is covered under fair use,
1546060	1550580	it would be highly debatable whether their documentation here was transformative enough,
1550580	1553100	and I'd be inclined to side against it.
1553100	1556700	Some also pointed towards advertisements being shown on the site,
1556700	1559180	challenging the nonprofit credentials,
1559180	1561940	though I haven't seen any in my own examination.
1561940	1563740	So why didn't Disney act?
1563740	1566500	Well, if they had succeeded in pulling down these sites,
1566500	1568460	I doubt it would have done them much good,
1568460	1573340	as it probably would have just made users and moderators more stubborn and alienated the remaining
1573340	1574460	fans they had.
1574460	1577820	So this may have held them back from being more dogged about it.
1577820	1579580	But one thing was for certain,
1579580	1583060	Disney was going to struggle to win back the lost audience here,
1583060	1587900	and it appeared over time that these private servers had won the battle for the heart of the game and
1587900	1590500	had become extremely powerful in the process.
1590500	1593100	With great power comes great responsibility,
1593100	1594300	and as time transpired,
1594300	1598060	some began to question whether those in charge were properly equipped.
1598060	1602020	Clubhuman Rewritten was hacked and the database was breached by hackers.
1602020	1605780	And do you want to know how bad of a breach it was?
1605780	1607300	Even though it wasn't released publicly,
1607300	1609020	like some other Clubhuman private servers,
1609500	1613820	Clubhuman Rewritten was using a hashing method called MD5.
1613820	1615500	Basically MD5,
1615500	1618420	what it does is it just like takes a password.
1618420	1620140	If your password is password,
1620140	1622780	it just takes passwords and like encrypts it,
1622780	1624700	even though it's not really encrypting its hashing,
1624700	1630380	but it just jambles up the letters and it makes a really long stretch of text.
1630380	1633420	So let's say I hacked Clubhuman Rewritten a year ago.
1633420	1635140	I could take anybody's password,
1635140	1639100	I could dehash the MD5 hash,
1639100	1643020	and I would get the text of the password plain as day.
1643020	1645100	So if I wanted to hack Cody's account,
1645100	1647900	once I hacked the Clubhuman Rewritten database,
1647900	1649260	I could just take his password,
1649260	1650500	put it in a website,
1650540	1651460	get the plain text,
1651460	1652740	and then I'd have his password.
1652740	1654180	And if he's stupid,
1654180	1656860	as stupid as he seems he is online,
1656860	1659100	he would use the same password on every website,
1659100	1661580	and I could just hack into every single one of his accounts.
1661580	1665260	And that is why Clubhuman Rewritten was not safe a year ago.
1665260	1669020	When you run a large site in which people have data which they wish to protect,
1669020	1671740	you are in control of a lot of user information.
1671740	1673380	When you're part of a large company,
1673380	1678260	preserving user data is a relative priority that one has the resources to commit to.
1678260	1679460	If you fail to do so,
1679460	1681220	you may lose consumer trust,
1681220	1686060	and you could well be hounded in the media for not having the sufficient protections in place.
1686060	1691420	Large companies like to conduct themselves with a degree of professionalism because business is on the line.
1691420	1694180	This doesn't just mean a load of protections from hackers,
1694180	1697780	but it also means employee culpability if one of them goes rogue.
1697780	1700340	And given the possible future employment repercussions,
1700340	1701660	if a person does do that,
1701660	1706340	generally, people like to respect the privacy of the users they are assigned to safeguard.
1706460	1708500	With bootleg Club Penguin clones,
1708500	1711500	these principles are predominantly a little less prevalent.
1711500	1715100	This doesn't mean that people won't try to guarantee user security,
1715100	1717820	but it means they may struggle for a variety of reasons.
1717820	1720860	Firstly, you need a consistent and accountable workforce.
1720860	1723500	Plenty of people do their work online anonymously.
1723500	1725420	This is not just anonymous to the user,
1725420	1728100	but this is anonymous to the people they work with as well.
1728100	1729300	Club Penguin Rewritten,
1729300	1732340	as many sites alike, claim to be nonprofits.
1732340	1734460	Some of these sites did this for legal reasons,
1734460	1736220	others likely did it to compete.
1736220	1739500	This meant that you had to rely on good faith volunteers,
1739500	1743940	some of whom you probably didn't know that well and could disappear at any moment.
1743940	1748180	Secondly, such security relies on very advanced technical programming,
1748180	1753220	which once again doesn't seem that many users behind these versions have great experience in.
1753220	1754780	It doesn't mean they're incompetent.
1754780	1757300	No, I'm sure they do a much better job than me,
1757300	1759820	but I'm not the one they need to be worrying about.
1759820	1764780	On three separate occasions between the start of 2017 and the end of 2019,
1764780	1767300	Club Penguin Rewritten experienced cyber attacks,
1767300	1771420	two of which resulted in millions of user data being compromised.
1771420	1776500	As for the staff, well, it's hard enough to run a Discord server with a few thousand members,
1776500	1778380	let alone an MMO with millions,
1778380	1781540	so I don't plan to rag on the executive staff too much here.
1781540	1784660	But when you present such content under the Club Penguin banner,
1784660	1786500	you have to do the best.
1786500	1791740	It's impossible to ignore the fact that there have been multiple instances involving one or two staff members
1791740	1796900	which has spiralled inconceivably, even leading to the website being offline for over a month.
1796900	1800780	However, despite all of Club Penguin Rewritten's technical shortcomings,
1800780	1805220	their management, albeit occasionally amateurish, did not seem to act with malice.
1805220	1812220	But it seems the actual reason why the private server is shutting down is because it's simply gotten too big for the people running it to handle.
1812220	1819180	Apparently, it was being run by a group of teenagers who were working on it as a passion project and wanted to learn how to manage an online multiplayer game.
1819220	1822860	I feel that generally speaking, most of them did have good intentions,
1822860	1827420	and if you manage to root out the agitators, then you can run a somewhat functional project.
1827420	1834620	The team did seem to genuinely take an interest in improving their game and did introduce changes and events which reflected this philosophy.
1834620	1840940	They were arguably the most mainstream Club Penguin server, and for what it was, they didn't necessarily do a bad job.
1840940	1844780	They created a place for people who didn't want to be a part of Club Penguin Island,
1844780	1848700	but still wanted to be a part of the community that they had come to know and love.
1848700	1851460	Because Club Penguin was always greater than the game.
1851460	1858100	Club Penguin Rewritten outlived Club Penguin Island, and over the years following its launch, the game persevered.
1858100	1860740	So what happened next?
1860740	1865700	Well, although Club Penguin Rewritten was a platform somewhat true to the spirit of the original,
1865700	1872380	a new brand of server emerged, and one that would eventually become even more popular than that which we've just discussed.
1872380	1873660	That wasn't a good thing.
1873660	1875980	Let us continue, my friends.
1878700	1887220	Private servers are not safe, but that's no surprise.
1887220	1893900	No private server was completely safe for those who wanted to use it, because you're sharing data with the individuals in charge,
1893900	1897900	and allowing it to be opened up to those who may breach that site's security.
1897900	1904100	There was a point where private just became a buzzword, and the truth is that most of these servers had gone pretty public,
1904100	1906220	many under the branding of Club Penguin.
1906220	1911020	However, some resembled the original less than others, and that's where we're going next.
1911020	1915140	Now, I'm no expert when it comes to dealing with assets and that kind of jazz.
1915140	1920020	What I do know is that for many games, you will typically find ways to switch up with the power of mods.
1920020	1926540	Mods, short for modifications, are typically alterations implemented by players which change aspects of the game,
1926540	1931860	typically with the intent of enhancing a game's entertainment value and providing a little more variety.
1931860	1938260	Mods play a significant role in many online communities, particularly people who find the regular game a little too vanilla,
1938260	1939900	even if it's Club Penguin.
1939900	1943980	Some people just want a modded game where they can feel like they're playing God.
1943980	1946180	On principle, I don't have a problem with that.
1946180	1949540	Modded games are fairly standard and unexceptional.
1949540	1957020	However, what if a modded server decided that they wanted to compete with the mainstream servers and present itself as a viable market
1957020	1959460	alternative to the original Club Penguin?
1959460	1961140	Okay, a bit chaotic.
1961140	1969300	How about that modded server decide to partake in various underhanded tactics to advance their status and their profit within the community?
1969300	1974380	Wait, what? Yeah, let's talk about Virtual Penguin.
1974380	1977380	Shut down. So yeah, it's hit a lot of people.
1977380	1980980	We're going to be checking a private server called Virtual Penguin.
1980980	1985620	You may have seen this from my fifth YouTube anniversary video of people advertising this.
1985660	1987060	Well, I didn't even know what it was back then.
1987060	1991220	I thought it was like some type of hacking thing to let you have a membership.
1991220	1994740	But then I looked it up on YouTube and it's actually a private server.
1994740	1996340	So this is actually really cool.
1996340	2001420	Virtual Penguin was a modded server once again established before Club Penguin's demise.
2001420	2004260	However, with the news that Club Penguin was closing its doors,
2004260	2012740	the lads over at Virtual Penguin saw an opportunity to set up a bot to advertise their server with the hope of attracting users in search of another option.
2012740	2015780	They probably garnered a fair through patrons through this method.
2015780	2017460	However, it was not enough.
2017460	2022220	And with other servers pulling a user base, they decided they wanted to up the ante a little.
2022220	2023820	What did this entail?
2023820	2027740	In the post titled Warning, don't use Virtual Penguin,
2027740	2034340	they mentioned that the team behind Virtual Penguin was hacking other Club Penguin private servers and banning everyone on them.
2034340	2041740	This was most likely in order to block people out of their accounts in the other private servers so that they'd sign up to Virtual Penguin instead as an alternative.
2041740	2046340	Here's a screenshot of Anthony, who I'm pretty sure is the person in charge of Virtual Penguin,
2046340	2052940	rallying up his team in the DMs and announcing that they're going to kill Super CPPS, another private server.
2052940	2056860	So these guys weren't just trying to innocently grow and promote their website.
2056860	2061460	They were trying to monopolize the game by killing off the competition.
2061460	2063260	What do you mean you chill with them?
2063260	2067140	Wasn't your philosophy more users equals more money?
2067140	2070020	We must eradicate Super CPPS.
2070020	2071540	Then one of his minions pipes up.
2071540	2073540	I want to take down CPR.
2073540	2080060	That's Club Penguin rewritten, which pretty much was and still is the biggest Club Penguin private server out there.
2080060	2082260	Anthony responds, we can't.
2082260	2083340	Not yet anyway.
2083340	2085020	And Timmy's like, why?
2085020	2088820	And to that, Anthony responds, why not build our empire?
2088820	2093300	I'd like to remind you that he's talking about a Club Penguin private server.
2093300	2097700	Why not build our empire by conquering the weaker CPPSs first?
2097700	2100860	You say you're able to take down Super CPPS.
2100860	2103340	So let's fuck their shit up.
2103340	2105980	Wow, I feel like I'm reading Game of Thrones.
2105980	2113500	Yes, in a video by gaming YouTuber Tamago, he documents how a moderator by the name of Anthony was targeting competing services,
2113500	2119100	with the intent to jeopardize their business while offering a much more stable, useful service himself.
2119100	2125300	It was a rather maniacal maneuver, but some may find it a bit drastic, given that it's, well, Club Penguin.
2125300	2126620	It doesn't stop there, though.
2126660	2129020	Following Tamago's reporting on the situation,
2129020	2134700	Anthony ordered the hacking of Tamago's Snapchat before sending explicit content to his contacts,
2134700	2137700	and joining Tamago's Discord server to brag about it.
2137700	2142060	A rather bizarre situation, and yet it doesn't even end there.
2142060	2143900	It's only the start.
2143900	2144740	I can't log in.
2144740	2149300	I go check my email, three emails in a row from Team Snapchat.
2149300	2152700	First one says there was a login attempt from an iPhone X.
2152700	2155260	I do not have an iPhone X.
2155260	2158700	Second one says my password was changed.
2158700	2159700	By who?
2159700	2167020	Third one says the login authentication app was enabled, so at this point, I'm like, okay, I have been pwned.
2167020	2169100	Yeah, that's weird, I didn't send anything.
2169100	2169940	What did it say?
2169940	2174700	He's like, well, yeah, so the message said,
2174700	2177420	f*** all you gentlemen.
2177420	2178180	Dick pic.
2178180	2181580	So there were three supposed people involved in the incident.
2181580	2188100	One of them, called Jacko, posted a couple of screenshots to show that they were indeed logged into my Snapchat account.
2188100	2193580	While another one, the one who claimed to be Anthony, although his name on Discord was Riley,
2193580	2199100	wrote that he had created evidence of me asking fans for explicit images,
2199100	2203020	and that he had sent this evidence to Keemstar.
2203020	2208500	Now, Aaron, another moderator on my Discord server, asked them why they hacked my account,
2208500	2215380	and Riley, who again is supposedly the real Anthony, posted my video talking about Club Penguin private servers.
2215380	2220740	So this was apparently a revenge hacking, which I don't think was justified,
2220740	2223700	because in that video, I wasn't even making fun of anybody.
2223700	2229700	I was more so just laughing at the fact that there was drama in the Club Penguin community to begin with.
2229700	2234380	In Tamago's first video on this matter, he states that as recording, Virtual Penguin was defunct.
2234380	2238580	However, they had merely rebranded and adopted a more mainstream Club Penguin approach.
2238580	2243420	Anthony, or as other people know him as Riley, was still very much active within the community,
2243420	2246300	this time on the craftily named Club Penguin Online.
2246300	2250300	Now, Club Penguin Online was once again a place with fewer constraints,
2250300	2254220	and with the new lockdown measures forcing many people to spend more time inside,
2254220	2259900	a lot of individuals, including those of the younger generation, decide to spend more time with online games.
2259900	2265580	This led to media outlets and YouTubers flocking to farm the new epic headline of Club Penguin being back,
2265580	2267900	with differing degrees of accuracy.
2267900	2274220	This Evening Standard article claims that the game was relaunched by Penguin Club's creators.
2274220	2282060	They called it Penguin Club, which suggests to me that these articles were written hastily as a way to gather views and clicks,
2282060	2285980	rather than as the result of any genuine journalistic motivation.
2285980	2292980	This caused a surge in Club Penguin Online's traffic, as many people were probably looking at how to play Club Penguin Online,
2292980	2295900	and that led them to Club Penguin Online.
2295900	2302540	There is the trickery, and by April 2020, Club Penguin Online was the most actively used Club Penguin,
2302540	2304740	with over seven million members.
2304740	2311740	However, Club Penguin Online was no Club Penguin, and with a more laissez faire approach to what it deemed as suitable content,
2311780	2317620	it inevitably led to a bit of a shock for children who signed up, under the impression that this was similar to the original.
2317620	2325740	In a rather ironically amusing yet unnerving article by the BBC, they chronicle some of the interactions that a BBC reporter had on the site.
2325740	2331540	Some of the examples illuminated the BBC's boomeristic nature, but others did raise legitimate concern,
2331540	2336100	and probably shouldn't be anywhere near content with the Club Penguin name attached to it.
2336500	2340780	There's tons of swearing, and almost all conversations end up about sex.
2340780	2344300	There's even penguin-y sex, basically sexting.
2345020	2347740	There's also some pretty toxic chat and b******.
2347740	2350740	I saw some horrible antisemitism and racism.
2350740	2356580	At one stage, I was invited to someone's igloo, which had been decorated by spelling out the N-word in chairs.
2356580	2362220	Now, as I understand, there were certain boundaries between the mature sections and the more universal areas.
2362260	2368180	However, these borders were not enforced, and although it's impossible to stop younger children from playing more mature games,
2368180	2376500	maybe publicly marketing a mature version of a children's game and making it fully accessible alongside the moderated version is a bad idea,
2376500	2378980	particularly considering the target demographic.
2378980	2383220	It is antithetical to the reason that the game was made in the first place.
2383220	2387060	You're kind of letting that greasy old man play with the kids in the jungle gym.
2387060	2391220	It's a bit suspect, and I'm not trying to imply anything here about its creator,
2391220	2397460	but yes, it appears our friend Riley was up to a little more than hacking people's snapchats.
2397460	2402340	Now, he had been reported this all the way back in 2018 with corroborating evidence.
2402340	2407740	However, these posts hadn't stopped him at the time, and they continue to behave in rather reprehensible fashion.
2407740	2413260	It appeared that as the owner of Club Penguin Online and the individual with control over the staff in the game,
2413260	2419260	he was surrounded and enabled by people who were more concerned about personal status than the safety of their users.
2419300	2426100	Nonetheless, one thing that the existing allegations highlighted was that Riley's actions were reckless and done with the brazen attitude
2426100	2430180	of someone who thought he could get away with everything, and for a while he did.
2430180	2437620	However, eventually someone's gonna realize the futility of power in the world of Club Penguin and turn on you with actual consequences.
2437620	2444420	And in 2020, with the spike of interest in Club Penguin Online, one former member decided that he had enough.
2444420	2451460	Today I'm making this video because I want the world to know what Club Penguin Online is doing,
2451460	2460180	what the owner of that game is doing, and the evil, the sickening, the disgust that that community has,
2460180	2462980	and that is hiding from you, the user.
2462980	2469460	With this video came a domino effect which would bring about the apocalypse for online Club Penguin content.
2475420	2482620	Joey Hughes was a former moderator for Club Penguin Online, where he was known as Twix and a few other pseudonyms to boot.
2482620	2487580	He claims to have left when he had enough of the system that Club Penguin Online and its owner were operating.
2487580	2495100	However, upon his departure in October 2019, screenshots show the CPO team had attempted to smear Twix's reputation,
2495100	2498020	implying that he had been sacked for inappropriate behavior.
2498020	2502860	He had defended himself in a Reddit thread at the time, but it appears that come 2020,
2502860	2507780	he was no longer comfortable with the authority of this website and sought to take it down.
2508180	2512260	Over the space of three videos, he shows evidence and provides in-depth testimony,
2512260	2516380	which not merely paints Riley as being a malicious hacker and all-round megalomaniac,
2516380	2522900	but also as a predator and someone who used his power to bargain for various explicit content from people who were not of age,
2522900	2524900	and then proceeding to brag about it.
2524900	2530540	On top of this, he talks about the support system in place and the corrupted colleagues that Riley surrounds himself with
2530540	2533540	for the pursuit of that sweet, sweet Club Penguin Moolah.
2533540	2536100	My Club Penguin Online is the biggest server out there.
2536100	2542140	There is no server that has as many active users, as many registered users as Club Penguin Online,
2542140	2549260	and it's very scary knowing that someone like Riley, someone that is a sick-minded and evil as Riley, owns the server.
2549580	2552460	It's hard to think of much to say about this situation, really.
2552460	2555180	It was basically a Club Penguin Mafia.
2555180	2560300	People were being doxxed, harassed, hacked, sites were being de-doxed, all of which created a cycle.
2560300	2564860	When Club Penguin Online gathered traction, more people wanted to be a part of the action.
2564860	2571940	This led people reaching out to Riley for roles on the servers, which would allow Riley to solicit inappropriate content in exchange for these ranks.
2571940	2575700	This led to a more expansive workforce, and more people to do his bidding,
2575700	2582900	many of which included attacking other competing sites and owners, which inevitably led to greater momentum for their own server,
2582900	2587020	bestowing Riley with even more power, allowing the sequence to continue.
2587020	2593020	The screenshots that you're seeing right now is from 16-year-old Chloe, which is one of his more recent exes,
2593020	2602620	basically telling me that Riley asked for food, she sent him food, and she, in return, got admin.
2602620	2611020	Now, I want you guys to know that anyone under the age of 18 in both the United Kingdom and in America is considered a minor.
2611020	2614220	Chloe is 16, Riley is 20 years old.
2614220	2615820	And what if you wanted out?
2615820	2621820	Well, it turns out that sending explicit content to a person not known for his integrity probably wasn't the best idea,
2621820	2624820	and even if you didn't, it appears that you were not safe.
2624820	2628620	But the only reason why I stayed silent was because Riley had my personal information.
2628620	2631820	He had my address, he had my phone number, he had photos of me.
2631820	2640220	So he had information on me, and he threatened me that if I spoke out against him, if I told anyone what was going on,
2640220	2643020	that he would swap me, and he would make my life hell.
2643020	2649020	Riley had control in the places that mattered, and in the world of Club Penguin behaved like a kingpin.
2649020	2651420	And what is a pimp without the ladies?
2651420	2655620	Back for you. If you send n****s to Riley, he will give you admin in return.
2655620	2660020	That's what happened with Chloe, that's what happened with Vale, that's what happened with Sydney,
2660020	2664020	that's what happened with tons of other staff members that just kind of randomly popped out of nowhere,
2664020	2665620	and no one knows where the hell they came from.
2665620	2670620	Riley is also a big, big advocate on e-dating.
2670620	2673620	Riley loves to date young girls online.
2673620	2679620	He dates minors, he dated Vale, who was a minor, he dated Sydney, who was a minor,
2679620	2685620	Chloe, who was a minor, and currently this girl named Mariam, who just recently they got a Club Penguin wedding.
2685620	2690620	So congratulations guys on your underage wedding, I'm happy for you guys.
2690620	2693620	You'll have to forgive me for feeling a little nauseous.
2693620	2698220	But regardless, given the server's success, it generated a serious amount of income,
2698220	2704120	allowing Riley to take his predatory tendencies to the next level, allegedly visiting some of his e-girls.
2704120	2708620	From former colleagues to rival websites, Riley directed a trail of destruction,
2708620	2713220	despite actually having no discernible hacking or coding skills of his own.
2713220	2717620	He had the power, he had the goals, and that was all that mattered to him.
2717620	2724620	This server is a threat. We have allowed this man, this sick individual, to have this much power,
2724620	2732620	the money that he is making, he is using to have people hacked, he is paying hackers to do these horrible things.
2732620	2737620	You're giving this man money because the ads that run on his site, he uses.
2737620	2741120	Joey's position as a former staff member who carried out Riley's dirty work,
2741120	2744620	and is only now choosing to call out Club Penguin with their current prestige,
2744620	2747120	could be interpreted as a bit opportunistic.
2747120	2753120	However, the abundance of evidence, and already existent testimony before his video dating back to 2018,
2753120	2759120	heavily supports his point of view, helping this content serve as an additional platform to expose Riley's behaviour.
2759120	2764120	The Club Penguin online crew didn't cover themselves with glory either, regularly concealing incidents,
2764120	2770620	and fabricating resignations, only to allow Riley to still run the ship, a position which he had a stranglehold on.
2770620	2774620	However, it seems that he was losing his grit, and with the publication of Joey's videos,
2774620	2779620	this evidence began to circulate even more, and although initially not gathering too much recognition,
2779620	2784120	received a signal boost when other large commentary creators began covering the story.
2784120	2787620	It's what seems to be a common theme with everyone who talks about this man,
2787620	2791620	is that anyone who speaks out against him, gets harassed by him.
2791620	2797120	He used to threaten to dox people a lot, whenever, just the slightest little thing that would make him angry.
2797120	2803120	All this evidence of Riley slash Anthony, doing this absolutely revolting thing,
2803120	2808120	the testimony from this girl as well, and the conversations people are having about this man,
2808120	2812620	and it's all a similar theme, makes me believe that something awful has been going on in Club Penguin Online.
2812620	2820120	This is a huge website with millions of kids on it. I think it absolutely should be investigated by the FBI or some sort of authority.
2820120	2824120	Club Penguin Online themselves did not seem too delighted with the coverage,
2824120	2830120	but instead of attempting to respond to the claims, decided that they were just going to launch a smear campaign against their detractors.
2830120	2837120	Some of this included attacking people like Twix as a doxer, though there seems to be some timeline issues with this comment in particular.
2837120	2844120	This also has the incredibly convincing, I'm Millie, an innocent bystander line, which is actually quite hilarious, so I thank him for that.
2844120	2851120	I've had another deleted post, looked at the evidence, and to be honest, it then becomes very messy, particularly with Joey's own response.
2851120	2855120	I just want everyone to know that me and Kate did date, and, you know, it's a two-year difference.
2855120	2863120	At the time that I dated Kate, I was 19, she was 17, and she was going on 18, so it's a two-year difference, one-year difference, that's legal.
2863120	2873120	And, you know, me and her dated for a little bit, and I dated her all the way until she turned 18, and then after that, we broke up.
2874120	2882120	And she did send me n****s, and I never screenshotted them, I never, you know, did what Riley did, I never blackmailed her, I never did any of that stuff.
2882120	2890120	But she did send me n****s, but she full willingly sent them to me, we were in a relationship, and she full willingly sent them to me.
2890120	2900120	You know, I did collect n****s from her, but like I said, I never blackmailed her, I never exposed her, I never will do that, this is f***ing horrible, revenge porn is horrible, and I will never do that.
2900120	2905120	I can't appear to you the dude here, because I do understand the nuances in power dynamics, and blackmail.
2905120	2913120	What Riley was doing was much, much, much worse, and isn't really comparable to the actions of a late adolescent couple with equal power and two years between them.
2913120	2918120	However, if you're going to make the argument of legality, you should probably make sure that your hands are clean as well,
2918120	2923120	because otherwise, it brings into question the utilization of that argument for the moral purpose.
2923120	2931120	However, Joey did appear to disprove the notion that he had forcefully obtained any content, and continued to expose their shady behaviour in falsifying claims.
2931120	2937120	Joey also later received an apology from the guy who uploaded the original post on Reddit, which probably explains why it was deleted.
2937120	2946120	However, I did manage to unearth their formal response, it was terrible, the only thing of interest was a link to a page which was alleged to be the truth page,
2946120	2952120	but unfortunately, that has been lost to the sands of time, though I assume it wouldn't diverge too much from the narrative that we'd seen elsewhere.
2953120	2961120	...claims that people are constantly jealous of them, and are just trying to bring them down, and that jealousy is the main motivator because of how successful their server is.
2961120	2968120	They also say that the screenshots have been debunked, and were blurry photoshopped pictures that have been proved time and time again to be false,
2968120	2976120	and also they claim that this Dominic guy who's exposing them has gone around Discord using Riley's name on a fake account and making up these screenshots.
2976120	2985120	But then we have the chat logs from Club Penguin, Skype conversations, the Discord between the two people that didn't even involve Dominic two years ago talking about Riley's behaviour,
2985120	2991120	staff calling Riley out on his behaviour, there's a lot more evidence that matches up with the story Dominic is telling us.
2991120	3000120	There are a couple videos about this, but most of their statements just seem like a desperate attempt by Riley and his team to save the floundering reputation of the website.
3000120	3008120	Oh, and one more fun fact, a post reflecting on this was posted to the Drama subreddit, and it was removed by the moderators for causing too much drama.
3008120	3011120	Nice. This is Club Penguin, remember?
3011120	3018120	Yet, in spite of all this absurdity, this was really a detour for only the most engaged in the drama,
3018120	3024120	because truth be told, there was no volume of smear campaigns which could really overturn the weight of the evidence.
3024120	3029120	Only direct counter evidence could do that, and no one seemed to have any.
3029120	3035120	Eventually, Riley's page was removed altogether from the Club Penguin online wiki as if he had never existed,
3035120	3039120	and they attempted to start anew. However, it was a little too late for that.
3039120	3046120	You see, since the exposure of these claims and the accompanying evidence, multiple people had been beseeching Disney to take action.
3046120	3050120	After all, this affair had been operating under their name,
3050120	3057120	and for some people who may not be able to distinguish Club Penguin and their relative clones, they may begin to blame Disney for letting this happen,
3057120	3061120	subsequently affecting their revenue flow, and Disney wouldn't want that.
3061120	3068120	So on the 15th of May, with the evidence amounting, Disney decided to take action, issuing DMCAs to Club Penguin servers,
3068120	3071120	including Club Penguin Online and Club Penguin Rewritten.
3071120	3077120	Around the same time, an individual involved with Club Penguin Online was also arrested, assumed to be Riley.
3077120	3080120	He was subsequently released on bail pending further charges.
3080120	3087120	At the time, many people chose to celebrate, particularly those who had just been acquainted with this rather sinister situation,
3087120	3094120	and they had reason to. A dangerous individual had been stopped, and many people perhaps saved and liberated in the process.
3094120	3099120	However, for many, this outcome was equally bittersweet, as it marked the end of an era.
3099120	3101120	Where do we go from here?
3108120	3115120	Club Penguin is not back, and Club Penguin is not coming back.
3115120	3118120	When Disney came, they didn't just come for the offending parties,
3118120	3124120	they handed out DMCAs without discrimination towards both Online and Rewritten, causing many other sites to panic as well.
3124120	3131120	This was done under the veil of protecting the children, but if they genuinely cared, they would have done it long before May 2020.
3131120	3134120	In a way, I do wonder why they waited so long.
3134120	3140120	Maybe they do intend to bring Club Penguin back at some point, and thought the private servers would help maintain user interest.
3140120	3147120	After all, they have held on to the rights of the game, so maybe they plan on letting EA develop the next Club Penguin game.
3147120	3154120	Whatever their intent for keeping the game alive was, this situation put them in a position where it would be more beneficial to shut them down.
3154120	3158120	Rather selfish intentions aside, was this the right thing to do?
3158120	3164120	Yes, I suppose. The problem was that these clones needed to be more professional given the users that they were dealing with,
3164120	3167120	and it seemed that they just couldn't handle that responsibility properly.
3167120	3172120	It's a lot of data, it's very vulnerable, and for many young gamers who weren't aware of the technicalities,
3172120	3181120	if they had logins stored on a poorly protected site, it could easily expose them to individuals who had the intent of breaching the security for less than benign objectives.
3182120	3185120	Kids just see Club Penguin, and won a game.
3185120	3192120	Eventually, some legitimately bad actors emerged, who shouldn't have been anywhere near people's data, especially children's data,
3192120	3198120	and managed to create a successful business model capitalizing on people's nostalgia, while exploiting the power they had acquired from it.
3198120	3204120	But there's a newer command now in the game, and it's called exclamation point gas.
3204120	3208120	And if you execute this command, I'm going to put a screenshot on the screen right now,
3208120	3214120	this command will give you the IP address and the register email of that user.
3214120	3222120	And that is very, very scary, because you have staff members like Epic, staff members like Riley, who run this game,
3222120	3229120	and they have a history of doxxing people, DDoSing people, threatening people with personal information,
3229120	3233120	and it always makes you wonder, how did they get this information?
3233120	3240120	But if you have commands like this, that are available to staff members, it's very easy for them to run that command,
3240120	3247120	get your IP address, look in a few databases, and figure out who you are, or do an email doxx, and get your information just from your email.
3247120	3255120	And it's very scary knowing that there's children that play this game, you know, that all they have to do is run a command on the username,
3255120	3260120	and the last IP that you logged in with on the game, or you registered with, and the email that you registered with,
3260120	3264120	is all in their hands, just by a single command.
3264120	3269120	It was easy for press investigations to pick apart the flimsy barriers between children's and mature content,
3269120	3274120	and with a director who behaved like a mob boss while indulging in some pretty correctness depravity himself,
3274120	3279120	it was only a matter of time until this behavior was brought to light, it's just a shame it wasn't sooner.
3279120	3285120	With that said, I still feel bad there isn't some sort of compromise, if Disney let these sites exist for years,
3285120	3291120	then what would have stopped them from allowing a verified fan ranked Club Penguin domain to run under their general supervision?
3291120	3296120	However, Disney doesn't seem like one for compromises, it's all or nothing for them often,
3296120	3301120	and in this instance, as much as I don't like them, the decision was probably right.
3301120	3307120	Disney may well have additional plans for the game in the future because it seems they never went out of their way to antagonize their audience,
3307120	3311120	but when the times seem right, they decide they had more to lose by not taking action.
3311120	3317120	Smaller private servers will probably continue to exist, and maybe some new platforms will arise once more,
3317120	3321120	but with the current precedent set, their long term survival can hardly be guaranteed.
3321120	3324120	It's a shame, but good things seldom last forever.
3324120	3330120	Upon writing, Club Penguin Rewritten's site is still accessible, but apparently a large majority of the staff have since quit,
3330120	3334120	with other allegations from a mystery account surrounding their conduct too.
3334120	3339120	Though it looks like they are intending to continue operations, it's hard to provide an enthusiastic endorsement.
3339120	3344120	Maybe they've decided to call Disney's bluff, and I wish them luck on that front.
3344120	3349120	As for Club Penguin Online, well, their domain is down with a rather obstinate message in its place,
3349120	3353120	claiming the YouTubers who reported on the situation were paid off. Charming.
3353120	3357120	Club Penguin has always thrived on the sentiment of community,
3357120	3361120	and with many of these servers, I feel that was people's intent.
3361120	3364120	They wanted to hold on to something that they didn't feel they deserved to lose.
3364120	3368120	When Disney shut down the original site in rather ruthless fashion,
3368120	3372120	people weren't ready to move on, and certainly not with what Disney offered in its place.
3372120	3378120	There was always discussion of a successor for the original Club Penguin, given the accumulating bugs and complications,
3378120	3383120	but the successor needed to feel like Club Penguin, and Club Penguin Island just didn't.
3383120	3388120	RuneScape, for example, in spite of their new releases, generally keeps the map true to the original,
3388120	3392120	and has maintained a separate server called Old School RuneScape,
3392120	3396120	and it's commonly reported that the Old School server performs better than the new one.
3396120	3400120	You need to be sensitive to your audience's loyalty to a particular formula.
3400120	3404120	Disney underestimated people's ability to hold on to what they had become accustomed to,
3404120	3406120	and what they would do to maintain that.
3406120	3410120	The new sites were a defiant response to the closure of the original Club Penguin,
3410120	3415120	and at first, they did serve as a way for the community members to hold on to what they enjoyed.
3415120	3419120	A tight-knit community focused on their love of the game can typically self-govern quite well,
3419120	3423120	but as the months and years elapsed, it grew into its own market,
3423120	3426120	and when you have a market with real money involved,
3426120	3429120	you may not attract people with the community's interests at heart.
3429120	3434120	That's why we have checks and balances, particularly when younger and more vulnerable users are involved.
3434120	3439120	Unfortunately, some individuals were not accountable to the degree that many would deem acceptable,
3439120	3442120	and this exploitation of power spiraled out of control,
3442120	3447120	creating a cycle and subsequent chain reaction of events leading us to where we are today.
3447120	3452120	Club Penguin would never go quietly, but sometimes we should worry less about letting go,
3452120	3454120	and more about who may grab a hold.
3454120	3460120	And therefore, no matter how well-intentioned the owner of a private server may be,
3460120	3464120	they cannot be trusted to safeguard your personal information.
3464120	3466120	Keep in mind that whenever you sign up to these websites,
3466120	3469120	you don't only give them your email address and your password,
3469120	3475120	but you also give them access to your IP address, and with your IP address, you can be located.
3475120	3478120	So before you sign up to these websites, you've got to ask yourself,
3478120	3481120	do I trust these people with my information?
3481120	3485120	We spent a lot of time looking back at all these problems,
3485120	3489120	and for a moment, at least at the end, I think it's fair we look forward.
3489120	3494120	In 2018, when the remaining Club Penguin staff at the Kelowna office were dismissed,
3494120	3499120	with the detached letter from the faceless Disney Corp, a certain man reached out to them,
3499120	3502120	Lane Merrifield, one of the original creators of Club Penguin.
3502120	3508120	He shared a message of solidarity and offered these soon-to-be redundant workers a drink at their local bar
3508120	3509120	to talk it over.
3509120	3513120	The moral was plain, though. It can be hard to let go of what you've come to know,
3513120	3518120	but when one door closes, another will open, the sun will come up, the seasons will change,
3518120	3522120	and there'll be something to move on to, even if it doesn't seem like it at the time.
3522120	3528120	For example, one of Lane's co-bounders, Lance Pribb, has been working on a new game, Box Critters.
3528120	3533120	I haven't played it myself, but it appears to be what I would brand as a true spiritual successor.
3533120	3537120	It feels as if it was being made with the ethos that the original Club Penguin offered.
3537120	3540120	There were a lot of stylistic similarities as well.
3540120	3546120	If Club Penguin Island was Rollercoaster Tycoon World, Box Critters is Planet Coaster, gamer reference.
3546120	3549120	So if you feel disaffected from the community due to the recent drama,
3550120	3554120	yet still want to be a part of something in the same vein, maybe you'll find something there.
3554120	3558120	If not, that's okay too. Maybe the original is irreplaceable to you.
3558120	3562120	Maybe you just need a break. I know I do.
3562120	3566120	The point remains, as long as people like Lance and Lane are still around,
3566120	3570120	the spirit of Club Penguin will endure, in whatever form it takes,
3570120	3575120	and even though its current state may be disappointing, there's always something to take forward,
3575120	3577120	and I think people will find that.
3577120	3582120	All this time spent trying to recreate what Club Penguin was,
3582120	3587120	when in actuality, the real Club Penguin was inside us all along,
3587120	3590120	but that version isn't playable, so who cares?
3590120	3593120	When did Club Penguin die?
3593120	3599120	Some will say 2017, some will say 2018, some will say 2020, some will say that it's still alive,
3599120	3605120	but its legacy is a complex one which has only seemed to evolve over time, for better and for worse,
3605120	3609120	making people wonder, when should one truly walk along?
3612120	3614120	So yes, that was the video.
3614120	3617120	Do not have a clue when this one's going to be released, Jesus Christ.
3617120	3619120	What is going on in the world?
3619120	3626120	I have lost my mind, but we are persevering, and I will continue to persevere.
3626120	3630120	Sometimes, that's all we can do.
3630120	3635120	I want to give a big thanks to my editors, once again, they've done a great job.
3635120	3638120	Go and check them out, send them some love.
3638120	3640120	I don't know what I'd do without them.
3640120	3644120	I also want to give a big thanks to my patrons at the time of recording.
3644120	3647120	There's some $10 patrons up on the board right now.
3647120	3654120	I also have to give a big thanks to the $50 patrons, Amanda, Caroline, Devon, Hypercube,
3654120	3657120	some hullabaloo, and that's it.
3657120	3662120	I also want to give big thanks to my $100 patrons, Brandon Junk, Christopher Carrasse,
3662120	3665120	Yesenia Ramirez, and Candy Skulls.
3665120	3667120	Thank you very much, guys.
3667120	3669120	Your support is much appreciated.
3669120	3671120	It makes a great difference.
3671120	3673120	I don't really have too much else to add.
3673120	3676120	I'll probably be heading out now because I finally cracked.
3676120	3681120	Oh, if you want to follow me on social media, they'll be in the pinned comment below too.
3681120	3684120	So yeah, that's about it, though.
3684120	3686120	I'm probably going to leave now.
3686120	3692120	So, I'm The Right Opinion, and I will see you guys in the next one.
3694120	3696120	Okay, okay, I'll go.
3698120	3699120	Troy, where's the door handle?
3699120	3701120	Wait, what are you wearing?
3709120	3710120	Oh no.
3714120	3716120	Oh no.
