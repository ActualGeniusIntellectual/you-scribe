0	13700	Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time.
13700	20500	And I like video games. In fact, back in the day, I used to be a big gamer. However, contrary to the slogan,
20500	25500	which I pretty much retain for branding purposes at this point, I do not have much free time, and therefore,
25500	30700	I do not play as many video games as I'd like. One of the games, or series of games, I've always wanted to play,
30700	37000	but never quite got round to was Fallout. It seems like a fascinating concept, the dystopian, open world adventure
37000	42800	really captures my attention. Fallout as a game series has been going on for a few decades, and with critical
42800	48600	acclaim and popularity, it quickly obtained a substantial fan base which spilled over into the internet gaming
48600	53100	scene, and launched the careers of a lot of creators. It's not just the gameplay of Fallout that seems to attract
53100	57700	a lot of attention, but it's also the lore, the stories, and the mystery, in a way. When playing games,
57700	62900	we might experience something that provokes a question in our head, makes us think, I wonder what the story is
62900	68000	behind them. And like creators who delve into the mysteries of the internet, for example, the gaming equivalent
68000	72700	of these creators gain prominence with the same sort of approach, talking about the mysterious backgrounds
72700	78500	of some characters, and out of the roots came a YouTuber known as Oxhorn, the Fallout lore investigator
78500	84200	with a creamy voice. His videos delving into various cases, stories, and features, most prominently gained
84200	90700	traction over the 2017-2018 period. Now this wasn't Oxhorn's first venture on the platform, in fact he is
90700	95300	one of the older creators as the platform's history goes, prior to the Oxhorn channel he had a channel
95300	100700	named Oxhorn Movies, in which he uploaded World of Warcraft related content, which was certainly interesting
100700	101900	to say the least.
101900	117900	This has 17 million views by the way, good luck ever obtaining that sort of success with this sort of content.
117900	123400	He made the comment that he started making movies in around 2004, and therefore he must have pre-existed
123400	129200	the platform with his interests, however in 2013 he decided it was time to move on from this brand of content
129200	135000	and into other ventures. He had a podcast that he called Scotch and Smoke Rings, he also had a website
135000	141500	where he advertised beard care, grow a beard now, and he had his own personal blog, bloggingwithclass.com.
141500	146600	Now when someone's on the internet for such a long time, it's natural that they've probably got a lot of history,
146600	152000	a lot of pages up there that documents their journey, however sometimes when we look over a person's journey,
152000	157000	we see a few potholes they may have encountered, and we want to know how they would address it.
157000	162400	These are two separate processes that can definitely shape the perception of a creator and the possible implications
162400	168300	regarding their reputation. There's a lot more to the drama than meets the eye, but I found myself being contacted
168300	173700	a lot about this, and I was to be honest quite confused, because drama has a rather straightforward formula,
173700	178500	one side presents their case, another side presents their case, and then the beleaguered, bewildered audience
178500	184300	try and pick a side on the basis of what truths they can hopefully take away, and this isn't anything particularly
184300	189600	huge on the surface. Why would people want me to do a video on this bloke, as far as I could see,
189600	193900	a fairly inoffensive fallout channel that isn't pulling so many views these days?
193900	199100	Well when I began to spend more time researching content and watching the videos on it, I very quickly realised
199100	203300	why people were messaging me, because the truths that I just spoke about, they're not really clear.
203300	207700	The videos on him were long, I mean very long, and some of you creators clearly didn't get the memo,
207700	212500	because only I'm allowed to do long videos with pretentious rants, but I watched them because the right opinion
212500	218300	is a trooper, out on the front lines, watching the videos, so you don't have to. But now we've set the scene,
218300	224100	I want to lay out the situation, because I know a lot of you guys will probably not have a clue what I'm talking about.
224100	226900	Don't worry, Papa James is here to enlighten you.
226900	233700	So Oxhorn has appeared to have been embroiled in drama over a rather murky time period, at first it appeared to just be
233700	238700	criticism of his content and some of the coverage of Fallout games, but his response to this criticism,
238700	243900	which we'll get into in a moment, appeared to rub people the wrong way, and what happens is what you'd expect,
243900	247700	he made a few enemies, and internet history and enemies don't go too well.
247700	252900	What these people found was his blog, which had some fairly questionable views and propaganda published,
252900	258900	they found some of his old tweets, some articles that he had written himself on various matters, including homosexuality,
258900	265100	and on top of this they found other videos that showed him not quite as the sort of person he presents himself today.
265100	271100	This was piled alongside what many thought was his biased coverage of games such as Fallout 76 and Fallout 4,
271100	275300	and that led to suspicions of whether he had ulterior motives for supporting it.
275300	279700	On the surface, it created the narrative that he might be a homophobe with a bad taste in games,
279700	285700	but digging deeper, some people felt it made much of his content disingenuous, and that he was just an opportunist,
285700	290300	espousing the views that got him the ad rev. At first there was little public response from Oxhorn,
290300	295700	however, as the pressure continued to melt, and people began to question whether he still held some of his positions,
295700	301300	he decided to upload a public response, replying to the allegations, and going on the counter on many points,
301300	307500	claiming that his critics were mostly bad faith actors obsessed with bringing a harmless guy who made a few mistakes down.
307500	312300	This was met with support from many viewers who praised him for his calm, collected response to criticism,
312300	316100	however, there were still a sect of people who were unconvinced about his response,
316100	320500	and claimed that actually he had a habit of being quite authoritarian towards criticism,
320500	324700	and actually had not just taken down videos, but whole channels over this matter,
324700	328500	pretty much attempting to erase the history of his questionable behaviour.
328500	335100	This is a lot to digest, and honestly, the journey through the drama is one like a huge rollercoaster,
335100	338500	and if you get to a point in my video where you think you know which side I'm gonna take,
338500	340300	I might suggest staying a little longer.
340300	344300	But to do that, I think we need to get back into the right style.
345300	348300	Are you ready? Let's go.
357300	361100	I'm going to preface this by saying I'm not going to talk about Fallout a lot,
361100	366300	because it's not my main area of expertise, and frankly there is so much discussion on it already.
366300	370100	No, what I'm going to do is break down this drama into the section of allegations,
370100	373900	starting with the stuff that I don't think is really the strongest, but the oldest,
373900	376900	and you'll understand why I do that by the end of this part.
376900	380500	As mentioned, when you've been on the internet for a long time like Oxhorn,
380500	383900	chances are you've said some things that you wouldn't say in the present day.
383900	389500	This may be due to a change in ideology, or just the acknowledgement that it's inappropriate for your current format.
389500	394300	This recently came about with his blog posts, a few topics stuck out, firstly about porn,
394300	398300	secondly about homosexuality, and thirdly about substances.
398300	403300	Now, Oxhorn at the time of these posts, by the looks of it, was a person who was pretty invested in Christianity,
403300	409900	however, he takes a sort of Shapiro approach, doesn't really use the God said so, and tries to find some logical explanation.
409900	415700	In this instance, some of the bases of his arguments are applied through the perspective of prevention of societal decay,
415700	421700	and others are applied through Darwinism, and used to explain why the behaviour is immoral or undesirable,
421700	424100	as it's not evolutionarily preferable.
424500	436500	Anyway, so that, from a Darwinistic perspective, from the perspective of an animal that has evolved from the protozoa,
436500	442500	or whatever, to the creature that stands before you naked and shivering now, the man,
442500	448500	that is a man who has failed at being an animal.
448500	455500	Animals don't run around and look at other naked animals and get their jollies that way, they really don't.
455500	464500	That's really something that is only in mankind, you know, you don't see nude badger periodicals in the bookstore,
464500	472500	you don't, I mean that's just weird, you're not gonna find badgers lined up to buy the latest edition of Badger Boy, or whatever, Play Badger.
472500	476100	I mean, primates can masturbate too mate, but I wouldn't go too far into that.
476100	482100	The content criticizing homosexuality was written over a decade ago on Camera Of Truth on Blogspot,
482100	485700	where he basically posted articles that read like Craigoyou transcripts.
485700	492100	The other content was published around 2013 time in Oxhorn's very quaintly named Manly Festo,
492100	500100	which appears to be a guide on how to behave with class, like Oxhorn of course, he was the embodiment of a refined gentleman.
500100	505900	Now I'm being quite jovial about this because I find it quite funny, not gonna lie, maybe it's just the sentiment of it,
505900	514500	that there is this guru of class passing on his wisdom to the on-looking plebeians, such as thou shalt not beat their meat,
514500	517900	but I'll put this on hold to go to the homosexuality point.
517900	522900	So he wrote a few posts back in the day about homosexuality, I found them quite amusing,
522900	530300	but the central tone is that homosexuality is immoral, and if society deems it immoral, then they can discriminate it on the basis of morality.
530300	537100	This led to claims that he held outdated, bigoted views, he also tweeted out some articles and responses on his twitter at the time.
537100	540300	I'm not here to debate it, because he's already retracted it.
540300	545700	The thing is, although he comes across as rather self-righteous, it's easy to forget that gay marriage,
545700	551700	and even remote acceptance of homosexual relationships has only really become mainstream in the last few years,
551700	558900	and therefore I don't think it's really a thing worth exposing someone over, because it wasn't an uncommon belief back then,
558900	561900	especially if you've been raised in a very restrictive environment.
561900	567700	With that said, I think people who may feel alienated by such views can take up their concern with him,
567700	571700	and he can explain how he feels today, a bridge we will cross soon.
571700	576100	The whole porn and substances thing led to a lot of allegations that he was hypocritical,
576100	580100	the porn thing because he has mods that enable nudity in his Fallout games,
580100	590700	and his comments on substances because he is a frequent drinker and smoker.
590700	595900	Now, as far as the porn goes, I mean he did kinda qualify his statements a few years back.
595900	603700	There are people in real life who do get sex, and still watch pornography and masturbate,
603700	610700	but that's for a different discussion, we're not talking about sex in general, we're talking about satisfying sex,
610700	613700	and I get that into the article when we talk about marriage.
613700	619700	And it's hard to say if they're completely equivalent, although it's still a bit strange given his dispositions,
619700	621700	he does comment on it in his response video.
621700	627700	As for the comments on substances, although fairly disagreeable for myself, it's a case of what society has constructed,
627700	632700	and a lot of Oxhorn's views are clearly rooted in traditionalism of what is best for society,
632700	637700	and a lot of the substances that Oxhorn frowns upon are those ones that are classically ostracised,
637700	640700	for reasons some more rational than others.
640700	644700	It's not exactly hypocritical to decry them, as snobbish as it might seem.
644700	650700	Now, what his reasoning for sacrificing these views over the last year, we've heard a few responses from him,
650700	652700	in his response video that we'll break down later.
652700	659700	This moment changed many beliefs that I held. After all, if I could have been so wrong about homosexuality,
659700	664700	I could be just as wrong about the politics that I held, and my views on other social issues,
664700	673700	making nearly everything that I wrote in my 20s and early 30s outdated, and not an accurate representation of the person I am today.
673700	677700	And people can say that he's being disingenuous, and that he's afraid of losing fans,
677700	682700	but as it stands currently, I could not say for certain that those were his motives,
682700	688700	and although I do find the posts amusing, I wouldn't advocate dragging someone over them if they have expressed regret for them,
688700	691700	those were his opinions, he doesn't hold them anymore.
691700	697700	At the end of the day, when I'm doing any sort of activist work, my ultimate goal would be to convince people to change,
697700	702700	and if he's outwardly changed his views, then that at least is a message that he's conveying to his audience,
702700	704700	and that's a positive at least.
704700	709700	There was also a lot of criticism that he shills for Bethesda, basically, due to some misinformation in his videos,
709700	713700	particularly in the fact that he was defending Fallout 4 and even 76.
713700	718700	As said, I can't really comment on it, there's not really much that can be proved either way,
718700	720700	we don't have any bank receipts, unfortunately.
720700	724700	He might have his reasons for supporting it, but it's not the central issue here.
724700	728700	There were also some people criticizing him for not making a video unprovoked,
728700	731700	having to receive all these allegations to actually respond,
731700	737700	and although I do understand that perspective, it would seem weird to me to make a video unprovoked on previous views,
737700	739700	if no one was really thinking about them.
739700	743700	I think many people have had views they don't stand by in the past,
743700	747700	however, they were published online, so I do understand that perspective.
747700	753700	If I was in his position, I would have just released a public statement on Twitter or the community tab when they first arose,
753700	755700	just got something out there.
755700	759700	But when something was going as public as it was for him, a video must kinda come into play,
759700	761700	even if it was left a bit too late.
761700	768700	I think the purpose of a video at that point would be, if done right, to make sure that the other perspectives don't outshine his own,
768700	773700	because these criticisms were gaining traction and people wanna know if he genuinely still held those views.
773700	778700	There was also an old video going round of him allegedly fat shaming someone with quote,
778700	783700	too much personality, a rather mean-spirited video in which he mocked someone purchasing some food.
783700	788700	The video was around 6 years old and posted onto his YouTube channel, and he was revealing stick for this as well.
789700	792700	This is what happens when you have too much personality.
794700	800700	The reason that I've covered these topics from earlier on in his career are because these are things that could easily be quashed.
800700	804700	If these were the only claims, then his response would be straightforward.
804700	809700	He's a changed man, he realises the errors of his ways, and he won't be doing it again.
809700	813700	And in a way, that did happen, but it was missing some details.
813700	815700	So let's discuss his response.
819700	823700	So the first thing that Oxhorn did was remove the incriminating evidence.
823700	829700	Now, on principle, that is the right thing to do, as keeping them up can be seen as an implicit endorsement,
829700	835700	and when some people started criticising him for it, some fans and their defences of him were mildly concerning.
835700	839700	Why would I be scared of a faggot, boo motherfucker?
839700	844700	If you don't have the same ideology, you wouldn't want it spreading, or providing the impression that you think that way.
844700	850700	However, as I'm sure many of you know, these articles are typically archived by people, so the information is still out there.
850700	855700	However, for his domain, which contained his manifesto, I went to search it up, as you do,
855700	860700	and he actually placed a special request with the web archives to make sure you couldn't archive it,
860700	863700	which is admittedly a bit of a weird move.
863700	868700	I mean, alright, you don't want something out there, but as long as people already have screenshots,
868700	875700	it seems strange that you would try and completely bury its existence, especially when it was just a fraction of the criticism.
875700	880700	It does make you wonder what else was on there, but I digress, we cannot prove anything.
880700	886700	However, with the existence of questions surrounding his mentality, it made sense that he'd finally do a video addressing these claims.
886700	892700	As mentioned, it should have been a fairly simple dispatch of various points against him, and the comprehension that your positions have changed,
892700	894700	and on first glance, the video does that.
894700	899700	When I watched it first, I was pretty much done with the drama, and it seems many commenters would want over too,
899700	902700	but when I returned one more time, things didn't seem quite right.
902700	907700	I mean, he deals with the previous positions on homosexuality fairly reasonably, as mentioned,
907700	911700	although he could have dealt with it sooner, placed an explanation in somewhere,
911700	915700	not doing so doesn't make him a bad person if he considered those views in the past,
915700	921700	and given the very rapid expansion of his YouTube channel, he might just not really want to bring attention to it.
921700	924700	So with that one out the way, suddenly, something clicked.
952700	957700	Some viewers told me that this wasn't very kind, and upon reflection I agreed, and so I deleted the video.
957700	964700	It got only a handful of views before I deleted it, but as is the nature of the internet, nothing ever truly disappears from the internet,
964700	968700	and so trolls have dug up this very old video in an attempt to harm me.
968700	972700	Ok, but that's almost completely false.
972700	975700	There have been claims about the girl's age, but that's not verifiable.
975700	980700	What we do know is that this video was uploaded to YouTube and quickly became one of his most viewed videos at the time,
980700	983700	and was still up on his channel after three days.
983700	988700	This is not ambiguous, this is archived, which makes me wonder if he knew it was archived.
988700	993700	And sure, people confuse details, when you're making comments as if they're solidified responses,
993700	997700	and playing it down as if that's a defence, then you cannot allow for that.
997700	1004700	It's also noteworthy that all the details that Oxhorn gets wrong are details that would immediately play down the severity of such incidents,
1004700	1009700	and honestly, there is an inkling of suspicion in me that he does actually know how the incident went down.
1009700	1013700	The only thing that completely bewilders me is why on earth would he lie about it?
1013700	1018700	As far as I can tell, even if what he did has stayed up for a year and got 50,000 views,
1018700	1022700	an apology would have perfectly quelled any irritation that people felt about the incident.
1022700	1026700	It seems like a way to frame his mentality as impulsive, rather than what it actually was.
1026700	1030700	You can regret mentalities, you don't have to bend the truth.
1030700	1034700	On top of this, prior to the video, when asked about it in his Discord, he said it was a Twitter video.
1034700	1037700	Is he trolling? This is a bruh moment.
1038700	1043700	Alright, so that was a bit of a strange explanation, it had my suspicions raised a little, but life goes on.
1043700	1046700	Can't just throw someone to the dogs for a little misinformation.
1046700	1051700	He then launches into this attack against the people who have been trying to fabricate the claims against him,
1051700	1053700	some very malicious actors by the looks of it.
1068700	1071700	And then tried to spread around as if I had actually said it.
1071700	1076700	Another guy fabricated a conversation between himself and another big YouTube channel
1076700	1079700	using the inspect element option of Google Chrome.
1079700	1086700	He was able to just swap out the HTML to have the other YouTube channel say whatever he wanted that YouTube channel to say.
1086700	1093700	In this way, he started creating screenshots, spreading lies saying that this YouTube channel was working on a hit piece against me,
1093700	1096700	and that I had tried to bribe him to not publish that video.
1096700	1102700	These are all lies, and this particular user was even punished by the other members of his Discord server for lying to them.
1102700	1110700	But even though they know that it was a lie, this hasn't stopped other YouTubers from creating video content about these lies as if they could be true.
1110700	1112700	That's just the way many of these trolls are.
1112700	1117700	They'll use homosexuality and misogyny as weaponized tools to attack another person,
1117700	1123700	but when they're alone, their everyday conversations are rife with racism, sexism, and homophobia.
1123700	1127700	These organized attacks have taken a number of forms over the past few months.
1127700	1131700	The original Discord server where much of this went on collapsed due to internal struggles,
1131700	1135700	and so they've taken up a bunch of other Discord servers where the exact same thing is going on.
1135700	1140700	It's an organized campaign to try and spin a story that puts me in a negative light.
1140700	1144700	He basically suggests this encompasses the sort of toxic mentality against him,
1144700	1151700	and although I would certainly agree that those people engaging in such behaviour shouldn't be empowered in any sort of way whatsoever,
1151700	1154700	it's also important to look at the criticism and how it might have arisen.
1154700	1157700	Oxhorn says he doesn't have any sort of problem with fair criticism.
1157700	1160700	And people are free to disagree with me about lore.
1160700	1165700	I'll even hop into the comments section and have vigorous debates with people about specific lore topics.
1165700	1169700	As long as everyone is respectful and kind to each other, these can turn into wonderful conversations.
1169700	1172700	And I would say, this has been plaguing a lot of videos I've seen on him.
1172700	1176700	They're all just loaded with the fact that these people do not like Oxhorn,
1176700	1181700	and if you, as a YouTuber, believe he's manipulating his audience into thinking you're inherently toxic,
1181700	1184700	you really want to make sure those videos don't come across that way.
1184700	1190700	Fans will always go into the innocent until proven guilty mindset, even more strongly than most people,
1190700	1194700	and therefore, you have to put forward a decent case without going into too many ad hominems,
1194700	1196700	even if it's something that lights a fire on you.
1196700	1200700	That's just a side note, and one that I'd try and keep in mind for the future.
1200700	1204700	With that said, even though I don't think they were presented correctly,
1204700	1210700	I wouldn't brand all those who have criticized him as, quote, trolls, and we'll continue that lie of discussion in a moment.
1210700	1212700	Let's continue to watch this.
1212700	1216700	There was one time, for example, when I was doing a video on the Sunset's Hasperilla headquarters,
1216700	1220700	where I saw a Brotherhood of Steel decal on a manila envelope,
1220700	1223700	and I didn't realize at the time that it came from one of my mods.
1223700	1227700	Instead, I assumed that Obsidian had just reused assets from Fallout 3.
1227700	1231700	Obsidian did reuse assets from Fallout 3, they reused a ton of assets.
1231700	1236700	If you go into Michelangelo's sign shop, for example, we find signs from the Capital Wasteland,
1236700	1239700	that should not be in New Vegas at all.
1239700	1243700	However, once viewers made me aware that it was a mod, I immediately went into the comment section
1243700	1247700	and posted a comment correcting my mistake, and I pinned it to the top of the comment section.
1247700	1252700	Alright, so this is referring to the criticism that he was just looking to hate on Obsidian,
1252700	1257700	thus shilling for Bethesda, and although he admits he was wrong about the certain detail,
1257700	1260700	it seems he didn't immediately change it like he said,
1260700	1264700	although it might look like that, you can see that the pinned comment has been quote edited,
1264700	1268700	now people edit pinned comments all the time, I do, that's not a big deal,
1268700	1274700	but that also doesn't mean that the comment was posted immediately before any of these videos at all.
1274700	1277700	There's a screenshot of him replying, dude wow, just wow,
1277700	1282700	in a rather condescending tone to someone who brings this up, which once again makes you wonder.
1282700	1286700	With that said, a majority of his other responses are fairly straightforward,
1286700	1291700	they're mostly relating to Fallout, and I do think a lot of the allegations he received on that front
1291700	1296700	were fairly difficult to really do anything about, and therefore not really worth their weight in discussion.
1296700	1299700	However, he does end the video on a bit of a strange note.
1299700	1305700	I'm publishing this video because people have asked why they've been seeing a flurry of anti-oxhorn videos
1305700	1309700	recommended to them on YouTube, and it's because I'm under a coordinated attack
1309700	1312700	from people who are trying to punish me for playing Fallout 76.
1312700	1325700	Well don't worry Oxhorn, I don't give a shit about Fallout 76, let's talk about what I do give a shit about.
1337700	1340700	The thing is, although his response sufficed for many people,
1340700	1345700	some felt like he had omitted certain details, he does address them in a pinned comment eventually,
1345700	1349700	but let's discuss the accusations first and then bring it back to that.
1349700	1353700	People have been making videos on Oxhorn for a while, and on principle that's unsurprising,
1353700	1359700	if you're a large creator with some hot opinions and dirty laundry, then yes, people are gonna wanna talk about it,
1359700	1362700	and when I watched some of these videos on him, I wasn't particularly compelled,
1362700	1368700	like as far as I could tell, they were the sort of small YouTuber content that you will find on anyone.
1368700	1378700	I doubt your wife would be okay with you using thumbnails like this, or like this, or like this, or even this one.
1378700	1384700	Oxhorn has stated in his videos to not give in to vices, all while smoking and drinking scotch,
1384700	1396700	but it is easy to let it slide strictly because most people usually don't consider alcohol or smoking to be a drug.
1396700	1401700	I mean, it's not the most persuasive stuff, and as a large YouTuber, it is fairly harmless,
1401700	1406700	which is why it's confusing that Oxhorn has allegedly taken such a hard-line stance against it.
1406700	1412700	There are multiple creators who have come forward claiming that Oxhorn has placed community and or copyright strikes against their videos,
1412700	1416700	and on top of that, has been silencing criticism over this in his comment sections.
1416700	1422700	The first discussed case is the one relating to a YouTuber by the name of Logical Underscore Fallacy,
1422700	1427700	now named Thomas Beckett. He made a video in response to Oxhorn's video defending Fallout 4.
1427700	1434700	As an outsider, it was a fairly confusing video with melodramatic rhetoric that didn't quite feel like it had earned its tone.
1434700	1439700	Maybe Oxhorn could ban me from his channel, but he cannot ban the truth.
1439700	1445700	And this is a new year, this is the year 2018, and this is the year that we fight back.
1445700	1450700	This is the year that we take a stand against frauds like Oxhorn.
1450700	1455700	As said, it's a video by a very small YouTuber that shouldn't really have too much of an impact,
1455700	1461700	and yet surprisingly enough, he was given a community strike for bullying, which is rather bizarre.
1461700	1467700	What is even stranger is then that his channel was taken down despite supposedly not having any additional content on the matter,
1467700	1473700	and with Logical receiving no further information than these emails, which attributed the removal to Oxhorn's complaints.
1473700	1479700	Now, it seems strange to me, personally, that YouTube would actually disclose the plaintiff, so I sought verification of this.
1479700	1484700	Now, I did speak to Logical, to see if he still had a copy of the email, which he said he didn't.
1484700	1488700	But not deterred, I decided to reach out to YouTube, and although they were hesitant at first,
1488700	1492700	once I told them I had permission from the owner, and it was pretty much all public,
1492700	1496700	they did confirm it was legit, so it's not looking good for our friend Brandon here.
1496700	1500700	However, I do say that with the reservation, that in their first response to me,
1500700	1506700	they say they don't typically name people who report other creators, so maybe the guy responding is confused here, I don't know.
1506700	1509700	I'll let you make your own conclusions regardless.
1509700	1513700	One thing that I would say is that, in Oxhorn's response, in his pinned comment,
1513700	1517700	he showed a general ignorance of the reliability of YouTube's system.
1517700	1522700	At the end of the day, we're not trying to necessarily make the judgement of whether the report was right or wrong,
1522700	1525700	we're trying to work out whether this was in good or bad faith.
1525700	1528700	And then we have to discuss the copyright system.
1528700	1532700	Now, Oxhorn has made a flurry of copyright claims in the last few years,
1532700	1538700	most of them on re-uploads of clips, and although I don't necessarily agree with preventing people from being able to see these clips,
1538700	1542700	see my video on Pokimane for that, he's still within his right to take them down.
1542700	1547700	However, one situation stood out, this is one with a creator named Sinon Mercer.
1547700	1550700	Now, he posted two re-uploads of certain clips onto his channel,
1550700	1553700	Oxhorn decided that he was going to get these videos removed,
1553700	1559700	but rather than just claiming them like many YouTubers do, he filed straight up DMCA takedowns,
1559700	1561700	which deals one strike per video.
1561700	1567700	Now, as said, he is in his right to do this, but it's pretty aggressive, and gives them much less channel mobility,
1567700	1572700	but maybe he just perceived the uploader as having ill intent against him, and therefore it was warranted.
1572700	1578700	So, clearly annoyed at receiving two strikes, Sinon then uploads a more regular quote exposed video.
1578700	1581700	As expected, it's not quite a content cop.
1581700	1587700	What I find ironic about the whole thing, though, is that a real man would admit and fix his mistakes,
1587700	1593700	which Oxhorn doesn't do, despite him claiming that he's so manly.
1593700	1597700	And what Oxhorn does is he goes in for the kill, he files a third takedown notice,
1597700	1600700	that would have terminated Sinon's account altogether.
1600700	1606700	Now, fortunately, through some miracle, YouTube actually intervened and stated that it was fair use,
1606700	1609700	which given how broken the system is, is almost incredible.
1609700	1612700	And with this, Oxhorn had fucked up, big time in fact.
1612700	1619700	Out of anything worth quote exposing him over, this is the closest you get to affirmation that he has the ability to be malicious.
1619700	1624700	Now, Oxhorn did not address this in the video, but he did respond to this in the pinned comment.
1624700	1629700	After stating that all critical channels on him are still up, which is a strange thing to say on principle,
1629700	1635700	because you'll only be able to see the channels that are still up, he then speaks about this specific situation relating to Sinon.
1636700	1641700	He states that the reason he made the stripe was because the video included the use of an animated short
1641700	1647700	that completely removed any real reason to watch his own video because it used the content in almost all its entirety,
1647700	1654700	and it was fine anyhow because YouTube saved him, and therefore he didn't necessarily need to look up the legality himself.
1654700	1658700	So I watched Sinon's video, and surprise surprise, Oxhorn's statement on it is false.
1658700	1664700	In Sinon's video, the animated clip that he uses is just over a minute out of the video which is 8 minutes long,
1664700	1672700	and ironically enough, uploaded in its entirety on someone else's channel where it's been for the last 10 years.
1672700	1677700	And to add insult to this injury, in the complaint that YouTube intervened in,
1677700	1683700	Oxhorn gave different timestamps which didn't even match where Sinon used the animated short in his video,
1683700	1687700	the clip he was complaining about was one where he was just talking in front of a camera.
1687700	1692700	I feel that a defence from Oxhorn is rooted in the point of view that you would have to be pretty petty
1692700	1699700	to go after this sort of exposed video that used information from other exposed videos and was recorded on a potato.
1699700	1704700	He clearly watched it all through, he is reaching Keemstar levels of obsessed.
1704700	1710700	I could barely get through 10 minutes of that video, it seems almost unbelievable, but he clearly did.
1710700	1716700	His point of view is also mixed with the idea that YouTube's system is just working fine and therefore it's not a big deal.
1716700	1720700	Nothing bad happened, even though his strike could have led to channel deletion.
1720700	1726700	The system is completely dysfunctional, and this has been broken for ages, even PewDiePie has been struck,
1726700	1733700	and YouTube didn't magically detect it, and this has happened again and again, anyone in commentary knows this.
1733700	1738700	The difference is when larger channels are struck, they can stand up for themselves, smaller channels don't have that,
1738700	1744700	and someone like Sinon would have never got their channel back, and that whole attempt to strike was reckless at best.
1744700	1748700	It makes the narrative that he'd do that to another channel much more plausible,
1748700	1753700	and his retrospective framing of the situation is misleading, more than forgetfulness can explain.
1753700	1755700	And speaking of misleading,
1757700	1763700	a lot of videos that have attacked Oxhorn have focused on a lot, which in my opinion is explainable,
1763700	1766700	even if Oxhorn himself has not explained them the best.
1766700	1772700	On principle, I don't think that someone should have their career ended for a load of old content that we've discussed today,
1772700	1775700	even if in hindsight it was done in rather poor taste.
1775700	1783700	There was a video uploaded called Defending Oxhorn, released by YouTuber Average Betas, who brand themselves as comedians.
1783700	1786700	Anyhow, in this one video, it is just a single bloke,
1786700	1790700	and throughout the first half of the video, he makes these sorts of defences that I've referred to,
1790700	1793700	and although I think they could have been a bit more well researched,
1793700	1798700	and people were giving him far too much credit for a line that was Jack from the Simpsons, I think.
1799700	1802700	Nobody's perfect, that's why they put erasers on pencils.
1802700	1806700	Everybody makes mistakes, that's why they put erasers on pencils.
1806700	1811700	His points weren't really that incorrect, that is until he gets to copyright,
1811700	1818700	and a lot of people have been going around citing this as a defence against the attacks that Oxhorn has been receiving,
1818700	1825700	and I don't think I can quite do justice for how bad I personally believe this next set of argumentation is,
1825700	1831700	so I think it's time to turn this into a little collab, and who else better served to cover this than my good friend, John Swan.
1831700	1834700	I suggest we bring him in, take it away my friend.
1834700	1838700	Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the writer pit- wait that is not the intro.
1838700	1844700	Hello everyone, Tro has asked me to cover this joke of a video, specifically the points relating to fair use.
1844700	1849700	I've studied copyright law quite extensively, so it's only fitting that the person who made this video,
1849700	1852700	Average Betas, starts off this section talking about copyright,
1852700	1860700	stating that he's not a lawyer, but that he can give a YouTuber's perspectives on the events surrounding Oxhorn and his copyright related incidents,
1860700	1863700	specifically on matters related to fair use.
1863700	1867700	Let's watch along and see what he has to say, I'm sure it's incredibly insightful.
1867700	1875700	However, I can speak from a YouTuber's perspective and give you what I know about striking channels, and what I know about fair use.
1875700	1879700	If for instance, someone steals my content and tries to pass it off as their own, then I can strike their channel.
1879700	1885700	If someone takes some of my paid content, like for instance something I put on Patreon, and they show it on their channel for free, I can strike their channel.
1885700	1890700	If a person takes private content of mine and shows it on their channel, I can strike their channel.
1890700	1894700	Wait, what? That's completely untrue.
1894700	1897700	Now, his language is a bit convoluted here.
1897700	1904700	He uses the word show, and doesn't specify whether this showing involves the content being used in an expose work of some kind,
1904700	1907700	or whether the content is just re-uploaded.
1907700	1914700	However, judging from statements further on in the video, I'm going to have to go with the conclusion that he means showing in any capacity whatsoever.
1914700	1917700	So, let's break this down.
1917700	1926700	He is very correct when he says that these cases are not necessarily against fair use, because these uses are definitely fair in many contexts.
1926700	1931700	But he's completely incorrect in stating that these uses are against YouTube's terms of service.
1931700	1937700	If we read YouTube's terms of service, we see nothing here relating to the topics which he has discussed.
1937700	1942700	But let's just say he made a mistake, and he meant to say the community guidelines terms.
1942700	1946700	But wait, nothing in there says anything about these topics either.
1946700	1951700	In fact, no document published by YouTube says anything about posting content behind a paywall,
1951700	1959700	or posting content that is not publicly available, aside from their copyright related documents, of which fair use is a valid defense.
1959700	1961700	Let's keep on watching here.
1980700	1982700	This is a major problem with these points.
1982700	1990700	I think average Batters is under the impression that content that is not published isn't protected by the same copyright laws as a published work,
1990700	1993700	in which case he would be unconditionally wrong.
1993700	2002700	Unpublished works hold the same copyright status as published works, and therefore are governed by the same fair use clauses as published works.
2002700	2007700	Furthermore, this has also been proved by multiple court cases on the subject.
2007700	2009700	He goes off on a similar tangent here.
2012700	2016700	...would be considered under copyright law, and are protected under fair use.
2016700	2020700	This means a private video of me at the beach with my family is not fair use.
2020700	2027700	Nor is any other private footage I don't make publicly available for entertainment consumption and copyright the works.
2027700	2032700	Just like how a deleted video on Facebook isn't under fair use, as far as I'm aware, I'm not a lawyer.
2032700	2034700	Yeah mate, we can easily tell that you're not a lawyer.
2034700	2036700	And again, completely incorrect.
2036700	2040700	And just shows how much this particular individual knows about fair use.
2040700	2044700	He didn't even bother to do a quick Google search to verify what he's talking about.
2044700	2048700	Another misinformed statement that completely manipulates the narrative is this one.
2048700	2055700	If I were to try to strike a channel that was using my content under fair use, or wasn't doing anything wrong,
2055700	2062700	and YouTube reviewed the strike and saw I was in the wrong, that I was falsely claiming something against that channel,
2062700	2064700	I would risk losing my channel.
2064700	2067700	This is, once again, completely incorrect.
2067700	2073700	To submit a DMCA strike on YouTube, you have to acknowledge that the strike is being made in good faith.
2073700	2079700	No one, aside from the individual who submitted the strike, could genuinely verify whether the strike was made in good faith,
2079700	2082700	especially when it is a grey area.
2082700	2088700	YouTube can't generally step in when strikes are made, since they have to maintain their Safe Harbor status.
2088700	2095700	Safe Harbor is a provision in US copyright law that states that services like YouTube are not legally responsible
2095700	2098700	for the uploading of unlicensed content by their users.
2098700	2103700	There have been circumstances where it was pretty easily determined that a strike was not made in good faith,
2103700	2109700	specifically if an account has been deemed as suspicious, however, for the most part, it doesn't occur.
2109700	2113700	Since it is difficult to tell whether a strike was made in good faith,
2113700	2117700	the channels that submit the strikes don't usually have consequences levelled against them,
2117700	2122700	and thus this claim, made by average batters, is a big stretch to say the least.
2122700	2127700	If someone posted a video about me and how they don't like my videos, then who cares, have at it, go nuts.
2127700	2130700	I just had at it. It was very entertaining.
2130700	2136700	Thank you for being a buffoon and gracing us with this discrepant conglomeration of Boulder Dash. Much appreciated.
2136700	2141700	Thank you so much, Jon. I hope he's cleared up any qualms that can be found in the video.
2141700	2147700	I'm going to leave his channel in the pinned comment, I'd definitely recommend checking his work out if you enjoy that sort of analysis,
2147700	2150700	though he needs to upload more, so make sure you go and let him know that.
2150700	2157700	To average batters, I apologise for Jon's butchering of your name, but you did butcher copyright law, so we'll consider it even.
2157700	2163700	However, with all this in mind, I want to begin to tie things up, though admittedly it's quite a lot to do.
2171700	2177700	In his response video, Oxhorn placed his critics into a collective who were all conspiring against him,
2177700	2181700	and although I would agree that some of these guys clearly have ties to each other,
2181700	2189700	I think they've more been united by their negative experiences with Oxhorn rather than being united prior to simulating negative experiences,
2189700	2193700	and maybe originally it was born out of his opinions on Fallout.
2193700	2199700	When you say something that is unpopular and kinda side him with the corporation, you're gonna get people who think you're shills,
2199700	2203700	and when watching some of the oldest videos on him, that's certainly how it comes across,
2203700	2209700	but eventually this manifested when people started to think that he'd overstepped his jurisdiction in responding to these,
2209700	2214700	and his attempt to finish off Simon Mercer's channel was probably where the cynicism peaked.
2214700	2220700	He really doesn't like people bringing attention to this stuff, and on principle, I get it, if you have something you're ashamed of,
2220700	2225700	then you don't want to be continuously dragged over it. Equally, you don't want people to look you up,
2225700	2230700	and that to be their first impression of you, you want them to be clear, that's not what you believe.
2230700	2234700	I think that's happened to a majority of creators on this platform, myself included,
2234700	2239700	but there's nothing you can really do than release a statement and roll with a few punches here and there.
2239700	2246700	There will be people with perceptions of you that aren't quite current or accurate, just make sure that doesn't become prevalent.
2246700	2252700	Twisting the truth in subsequent responses will inevitably come back to harm you because people will perceive it as dishonesty,
2252700	2257700	and trying to cover up these things makes people question if you really understand the gravity or the consequences,
2257700	2260700	or even feel remorse for them in the first place.
2260700	2265700	There's been a lot of evidence that Oxhorn is deleting comments on his newest video when people present counter-narratives,
2265700	2269700	such as the disparity between the YouTube comment count and Social Blade comment count,
2269700	2274700	as Social Blade updates after, implying that comments were being deleted post-publication,
2274700	2278700	even ones that seem reasonable, just coincidentally being against him.
2278700	2284700	Assumedly, a lot of people are being hidden from the channel too, and it seems he really wants to restrict the scope
2284700	2287700	of what's being said to those who are basically praising him.
2287700	2290700	And although it's his channel, he can do what he wants,
2290700	2295700	when you're so desperate to hide something rather than just making sure the public understand all the context,
2295700	2298700	people wonder what you've got to hide.
2298700	2304700	On top of this, there was another account that has been defending Oxhorn in comment sections named KK,
2304700	2308700	which was funnily enough created four days after the Oxhorn channel,
2308700	2313700	and it's only subscribed to him, with no other activity in the last eight years.
2313700	2317700	Although it's not impossible someone might have just come over from the Oxhorn Movies channel,
2317700	2321700	it is probably an alt. Loads of YouTubers set them up under brand accounts
2321700	2325700	because back in the day, it was an easy way to upvote videos in case they got bombed.
2325700	2330700	As a side note, can people start referencing in the description or the pinned comment?
2330700	2332700	Why did you put it on screen? Are you a boomer, mate?
2332700	2336700	I think Oxhorn, like some other creators I've encountered in the past,
2336700	2339700	really overestimate the sensitivity of an audience,
2339700	2344700	and just try and completely shield them from possible transgressions they may have committed.
2344700	2347700	It started as an attempt to remove some of the incriminating videos,
2347700	2350700	and it's clearly gone over the line,
2350700	2352700	and then when the videos became too much to handle,
2352700	2357700	he made a response video and a response comment where he somewhat addresses the claims,
2357700	2362700	but similarly downplays some and misrepresents others to preserve the image.
2362700	2366700	But I really think if he just said what had happened and just apologised,
2366700	2368700	then this wouldn't have prolonged any further.
2368700	2371700	Most audiences just want to enjoy the creators,
2371700	2374700	and be comfortable knowing they're supporting people who aren't terrible.
2374700	2379700	Most people's bars aren't that high for past political and moral standards,
2379700	2381700	especially if you're a Fallout YouTuber.
2381700	2386700	To add to this, I understand why there are a surprisingly high number of people who want me to cover this,
2386700	2389700	and I don't doubt they've probably reached out to get other creators as well,
2389700	2392700	but I think that people have been hesitant to pick this up
2392700	2396700	because a lot of the videos are hard to follow in exactly what they've been trying to say,
2396700	2400700	and bogged down in these sort of trivial points which tend to suppress the impact.
2400700	2404700	It's kinda allowed Oxhorn to jump on the narrative that these people are toxic,
2404700	2408700	and although some people clearly are, they're not without their legitimate criticisms,
2408700	2414700	and going as far as to end channels over it is quite ridiculous considering the quality of these videos in question.
2414700	2419700	I have a hunch if he'd never reacted in the first place, we wouldn't be sitting here having this discussion today.
2419700	2425700	And this isn't to say I think Oxhorn is a fantastic bloke who just needs a bit of good advice.
2425700	2429700	Some of his old articles could be somewhat reflective of a mentality he might still hold,
2429700	2432700	they come across as rather narcissistic,
2432700	2436700	and as someone who personally also deals with a bit too much narcissism from time to time,
2436700	2441700	I understand that you get the impression that people are completely out for you with bad intent,
2441700	2445700	and you just wanna wish they would shut up presenting this perspective which just isn't you anymore,
2445700	2448700	I completely get that, but Striking is not the answer,
2448700	2452700	you gotta channel that into something better and showing them that you are better than them.
2452700	2455700	Striking doesn't do that, it does completely the opposite,
2455700	2460700	and for what has been done, I would apologise and be grateful that you still have your channel,
2460700	2462700	but hey, that's just what I think.
2462700	2467700	Maybe it's not easy to have sympathy for people who you perceive as acting with ill intent.
2467700	2472700	For me though, I would never assume that someone has that intent inside of them just because they're against me.
2472700	2476700	Have I dealt with people with ill intent? Sure, but it's not worth making that assumption.
2476700	2481700	I know a lot of people have a real emotional connection to their channel, and to these causes,
2481700	2485700	and I wouldn't risk depriving them of that just because they said some mean things about me,
2485700	2488700	which is what it came down to, and I've tried to be nice to Oxhorn today
2488700	2494700	because I don't want to present a binary choice to people who may enjoy his content and his personality.
2494700	2500700	Do they either have to agree with the criticisms and thus hate him, or disagree with all of them and love him,
2500700	2506700	because then people will reverse the formula and derive their positions on the criticisms from how much they like their YouTubers,
2506700	2509700	and you can never really find any resolution there.
2509700	2513700	The truth is, when these things are brought up, people are prepared to forgive.
2513700	2518700	If people are calling you out, most audiences won't just hear that and assume you're evil from now on,
2518700	2520700	they want to hear your perspective.
2520700	2527700	This situation has spiralled beyond anyone's comprehension, and I want to address it because there are some real messages to take away from it.
2527700	2534700	If you're not a non, or other variances, audiences aren't going to crucify you if you're honest and upfront about your mistakes.
2534700	2540700	Don't try and destroy smaller channels because they make videos on you. Smaller channels aren't going to destroy your career,
2540700	2545700	they're more just a way to casually keep your ego in check, even if their criticisms aren't the best.
2545700	2549700	They're normally rooted in some sentiment that you can link back to a point.
2549700	2554700	If those criticisms aren't legitimate, then you can ignore them, and chances are they won't gain traction.
2554700	2557700	If they are legitimate, they probably won't gain that much traction either.
2557700	2562700	Just keep them in mind, address them in a post if you need to, then at least you've established your position.
2562700	2570700	I don't support cancel culture, but you can't go in the absolute opposite direction and attempt to just wipe out any evidence of these things happening,
2570700	2574700	because it doesn't change the fact that they happened, and people will still reflect on them.
2574700	2580700	There is a lot that I haven't spoken about that other channels have, and generally that's because I don't think it adds to the narrative.
2580700	2586700	People have said and done stuff on the internet, which we will be asked about, sometimes called out for.
2586700	2593700	What matters is that we don't try and let the paranoia about presenting a squeaky clean image drive us to attempt to silence those voices,
2593700	2596700	even if we think those voices are wrong or misled.
2598700	2605700	So yes, we are at the end of the video again, I want to give a big shoutout to the editors who have done a fantastic job as ever,
2605700	2610700	I'm gonna leave their links in the pinned comment below, definitely go and check them out.
2610700	2614700	Also, would love to hear your thoughts on this video, on the topic, it's an interesting one for sure,
2614700	2618700	I'm sure a lot of my viewers do not know about it, but I wanted to have a discussion over it,
2618700	2624700	because sometimes it's good to bring these things to light, even if it's not too much of a common occurrence on my channel.
2624700	2629700	I also want to give a big shoutout to my Patreons, thank you again, some of them are on screen right now,
2629700	2639700	you guys are great, thanks to my $50 Patreon, Sumhala Baloo, and my $200 Patreons, Brandon and Evening Steel,
2639700	2643700	your generosity is truly appreciated. Thank you guys very much.
2643700	2647700	I don't have too much else to add today, if you want to find me, you can reach me on Twitter,
2647700	2654700	at The Right Opinion, Facebook too, Discord as well, I'm fairly accessible, I like to think so at least,
2654700	2659700	but other than that, I don't really have too much else to say, so I guess I'll just leave it here.
2659700	2662700	I'm The Right Opinion, and I'll see you in the next one.
2673700	2685700	Thanks for watching!
