00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,700
Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time.

2
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:20,500
And I like video games. In fact, back in the day, I used to be a big gamer. However, contrary to the slogan,

3
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:25,500
which I pretty much retain for branding purposes at this point, I do not have much free time, and therefore,

4
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:30,700
I do not play as many video games as I'd like. One of the games, or series of games, I've always wanted to play,

5
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:37,000
but never quite got round to was Fallout. It seems like a fascinating concept, the dystopian, open world adventure

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,800
really captures my attention. Fallout as a game series has been going on for a few decades, and with critical

7
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:48,600
acclaim and popularity, it quickly obtained a substantial fan base which spilled over into the internet gaming

8
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:53,100
scene, and launched the careers of a lot of creators. It's not just the gameplay of Fallout that seems to attract

9
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:57,700
a lot of attention, but it's also the lore, the stories, and the mystery, in a way. When playing games,

10
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:02,900
we might experience something that provokes a question in our head, makes us think, I wonder what the story is

11
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:08,000
behind them. And like creators who delve into the mysteries of the internet, for example, the gaming equivalent

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,700
of these creators gain prominence with the same sort of approach, talking about the mysterious backgrounds

13
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:18,500
of some characters, and out of the roots came a YouTuber known as Oxhorn, the Fallout lore investigator

14
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:24,200
with a creamy voice. His videos delving into various cases, stories, and features, most prominently gained

15
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:30,700
traction over the 2017-2018 period. Now this wasn't Oxhorn's first venture on the platform, in fact he is

16
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:35,300
one of the older creators as the platform's history goes, prior to the Oxhorn channel he had a channel

17
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:40,700
named Oxhorn Movies, in which he uploaded World of Warcraft related content, which was certainly interesting

18
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:41,900
to say the least.

19
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:57,900
This has 17 million views by the way, good luck ever obtaining that sort of success with this sort of content.

20
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:03,400
He made the comment that he started making movies in around 2004, and therefore he must have pre-existed

21
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:09,200
the platform with his interests, however in 2013 he decided it was time to move on from this brand of content

22
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:15,000
and into other ventures. He had a podcast that he called Scotch and Smoke Rings, he also had a website

23
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,500
where he advertised beard care, grow a beard now, and he had his own personal blog, bloggingwithclass.com.

24
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:26,600
Now when someone's on the internet for such a long time, it's natural that they've probably got a lot of history,

25
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:32,000
a lot of pages up there that documents their journey, however sometimes when we look over a person's journey,

26
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
we see a few potholes they may have encountered, and we want to know how they would address it.

27
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,400
These are two separate processes that can definitely shape the perception of a creator and the possible implications

28
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:48,300
regarding their reputation. There's a lot more to the drama than meets the eye, but I found myself being contacted

29
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:53,700
a lot about this, and I was to be honest quite confused, because drama has a rather straightforward formula,

30
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:58,500
one side presents their case, another side presents their case, and then the beleaguered, bewildered audience

31
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:04,300
try and pick a side on the basis of what truths they can hopefully take away, and this isn't anything particularly

32
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:09,600
huge on the surface. Why would people want me to do a video on this bloke, as far as I could see,

33
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:13,900
a fairly inoffensive fallout channel that isn't pulling so many views these days?

34
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:19,100
Well when I began to spend more time researching content and watching the videos on it, I very quickly realised

35
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:23,300
why people were messaging me, because the truths that I just spoke about, they're not really clear.

36
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:27,700
The videos on him were long, I mean very long, and some of you creators clearly didn't get the memo,

37
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:32,500
because only I'm allowed to do long videos with pretentious rants, but I watched them because the right opinion

38
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:38,300
is a trooper, out on the front lines, watching the videos, so you don't have to. But now we've set the scene,

39
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:44,100
I want to lay out the situation, because I know a lot of you guys will probably not have a clue what I'm talking about.

40
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,900
Don't worry, Papa James is here to enlighten you.

41
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:53,700
So Oxhorn has appeared to have been embroiled in drama over a rather murky time period, at first it appeared to just be

42
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:58,700
criticism of his content and some of the coverage of Fallout games, but his response to this criticism,

43
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:03,900
which we'll get into in a moment, appeared to rub people the wrong way, and what happens is what you'd expect,

44
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:07,700
he made a few enemies, and internet history and enemies don't go too well.

45
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:12,900
What these people found was his blog, which had some fairly questionable views and propaganda published,

46
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:18,900
they found some of his old tweets, some articles that he had written himself on various matters, including homosexuality,

47
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:25,100
and on top of this they found other videos that showed him not quite as the sort of person he presents himself today.

48
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:31,100
This was piled alongside what many thought was his biased coverage of games such as Fallout 76 and Fallout 4,

49
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:35,300
and that led to suspicions of whether he had ulterior motives for supporting it.

50
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:39,700
On the surface, it created the narrative that he might be a homophobe with a bad taste in games,

51
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:45,700
but digging deeper, some people felt it made much of his content disingenuous, and that he was just an opportunist,

52
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:50,300
espousing the views that got him the ad rev. At first there was little public response from Oxhorn,

53
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:55,700
however, as the pressure continued to melt, and people began to question whether he still held some of his positions,

54
00:04:55,700 --> 00:05:01,300
he decided to upload a public response, replying to the allegations, and going on the counter on many points,

55
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:07,500
claiming that his critics were mostly bad faith actors obsessed with bringing a harmless guy who made a few mistakes down.

56
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:12,300
This was met with support from many viewers who praised him for his calm, collected response to criticism,

57
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:16,100
however, there were still a sect of people who were unconvinced about his response,

58
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:20,500
and claimed that actually he had a habit of being quite authoritarian towards criticism,

59
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:24,700
and actually had not just taken down videos, but whole channels over this matter,

60
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:28,500
pretty much attempting to erase the history of his questionable behaviour.

61
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:35,100
This is a lot to digest, and honestly, the journey through the drama is one like a huge rollercoaster,

62
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:38,500
and if you get to a point in my video where you think you know which side I'm gonna take,

63
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,300
I might suggest staying a little longer.

64
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:44,300
But to do that, I think we need to get back into the right style.

65
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:48,300
Are you ready? Let's go.

66
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:01,100
I'm going to preface this by saying I'm not going to talk about Fallout a lot,

67
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:06,300
because it's not my main area of expertise, and frankly there is so much discussion on it already.

68
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:10,100
No, what I'm going to do is break down this drama into the section of allegations,

69
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:13,900
starting with the stuff that I don't think is really the strongest, but the oldest,

70
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:16,900
and you'll understand why I do that by the end of this part.

71
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:20,500
As mentioned, when you've been on the internet for a long time like Oxhorn,

72
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,900
chances are you've said some things that you wouldn't say in the present day.

73
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:29,500
This may be due to a change in ideology, or just the acknowledgement that it's inappropriate for your current format.

74
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:34,300
This recently came about with his blog posts, a few topics stuck out, firstly about porn,

75
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:38,300
secondly about homosexuality, and thirdly about substances.

76
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:43,300
Now, Oxhorn at the time of these posts, by the looks of it, was a person who was pretty invested in Christianity,

77
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:49,900
however, he takes a sort of Shapiro approach, doesn't really use the God said so, and tries to find some logical explanation.

78
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:55,700
In this instance, some of the bases of his arguments are applied through the perspective of prevention of societal decay,

79
00:06:55,700 --> 00:07:01,700
and others are applied through Darwinism, and used to explain why the behaviour is immoral or undesirable,

80
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:04,100
as it's not evolutionarily preferable.

81
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:16,500
Anyway, so that, from a Darwinistic perspective, from the perspective of an animal that has evolved from the protozoa,

82
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:22,500
or whatever, to the creature that stands before you naked and shivering now, the man,

83
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:28,500
that is a man who has failed at being an animal.

84
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:35,500
Animals don't run around and look at other naked animals and get their jollies that way, they really don't.

85
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:44,500
That's really something that is only in mankind, you know, you don't see nude badger periodicals in the bookstore,

86
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:52,500
you don't, I mean that's just weird, you're not gonna find badgers lined up to buy the latest edition of Badger Boy, or whatever, Play Badger.

87
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:56,100
I mean, primates can masturbate too mate, but I wouldn't go too far into that.

88
00:07:56,100 --> 00:08:02,100
The content criticizing homosexuality was written over a decade ago on Camera Of Truth on Blogspot,

89
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:05,700
where he basically posted articles that read like Craigoyou transcripts.

90
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:12,100
The other content was published around 2013 time in Oxhorn's very quaintly named Manly Festo,

91
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:20,100
which appears to be a guide on how to behave with class, like Oxhorn of course, he was the embodiment of a refined gentleman.

92
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:25,900
Now I'm being quite jovial about this because I find it quite funny, not gonna lie, maybe it's just the sentiment of it,

93
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:34,500
that there is this guru of class passing on his wisdom to the on-looking plebeians, such as thou shalt not beat their meat,

94
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,900
but I'll put this on hold to go to the homosexuality point.

95
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:42,900
So he wrote a few posts back in the day about homosexuality, I found them quite amusing,

96
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:50,300
but the central tone is that homosexuality is immoral, and if society deems it immoral, then they can discriminate it on the basis of morality.

97
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:57,100
This led to claims that he held outdated, bigoted views, he also tweeted out some articles and responses on his twitter at the time.

98
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:00,300
I'm not here to debate it, because he's already retracted it.

99
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:05,700
The thing is, although he comes across as rather self-righteous, it's easy to forget that gay marriage,

100
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:11,700
and even remote acceptance of homosexual relationships has only really become mainstream in the last few years,

101
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:18,900
and therefore I don't think it's really a thing worth exposing someone over, because it wasn't an uncommon belief back then,

102
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:21,900
especially if you've been raised in a very restrictive environment.

103
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:27,700
With that said, I think people who may feel alienated by such views can take up their concern with him,

104
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:31,700
and he can explain how he feels today, a bridge we will cross soon.

105
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:36,100
The whole porn and substances thing led to a lot of allegations that he was hypocritical,

106
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:40,100
the porn thing because he has mods that enable nudity in his Fallout games,

107
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:50,700
and his comments on substances because he is a frequent drinker and smoker.

108
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:55,900
Now, as far as the porn goes, I mean he did kinda qualify his statements a few years back.

109
00:09:55,900 --> 00:10:03,700
There are people in real life who do get sex, and still watch pornography and masturbate,

110
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:10,700
but that's for a different discussion, we're not talking about sex in general, we're talking about satisfying sex,

111
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:13,700
and I get that into the article when we talk about marriage.

112
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:19,700
And it's hard to say if they're completely equivalent, although it's still a bit strange given his dispositions,

113
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,700
he does comment on it in his response video.

114
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:27,700
As for the comments on substances, although fairly disagreeable for myself, it's a case of what society has constructed,

115
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:32,700
and a lot of Oxhorn's views are clearly rooted in traditionalism of what is best for society,

116
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:37,700
and a lot of the substances that Oxhorn frowns upon are those ones that are classically ostracised,

117
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:40,700
for reasons some more rational than others.

118
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:44,700
It's not exactly hypocritical to decry them, as snobbish as it might seem.

119
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:50,700
Now, what his reasoning for sacrificing these views over the last year, we've heard a few responses from him,

120
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,700
in his response video that we'll break down later.

121
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:59,700
This moment changed many beliefs that I held. After all, if I could have been so wrong about homosexuality,

122
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:04,700
I could be just as wrong about the politics that I held, and my views on other social issues,

123
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:13,700
making nearly everything that I wrote in my 20s and early 30s outdated, and not an accurate representation of the person I am today.

124
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:17,700
And people can say that he's being disingenuous, and that he's afraid of losing fans,

125
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:22,700
but as it stands currently, I could not say for certain that those were his motives,

126
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:28,700
and although I do find the posts amusing, I wouldn't advocate dragging someone over them if they have expressed regret for them,

127
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:31,700
those were his opinions, he doesn't hold them anymore.

128
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:37,700
At the end of the day, when I'm doing any sort of activist work, my ultimate goal would be to convince people to change,

129
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:42,700
and if he's outwardly changed his views, then that at least is a message that he's conveying to his audience,

130
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,700
and that's a positive at least.

131
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:49,700
There was also a lot of criticism that he shills for Bethesda, basically, due to some misinformation in his videos,

132
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:53,700
particularly in the fact that he was defending Fallout 4 and even 76.

133
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:58,700
As said, I can't really comment on it, there's not really much that can be proved either way,

134
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,700
we don't have any bank receipts, unfortunately.

135
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:04,700
He might have his reasons for supporting it, but it's not the central issue here.

136
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:08,700
There were also some people criticizing him for not making a video unprovoked,

137
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:11,700
having to receive all these allegations to actually respond,

138
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:17,700
and although I do understand that perspective, it would seem weird to me to make a video unprovoked on previous views,

139
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,700
if no one was really thinking about them.

140
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:23,700
I think many people have had views they don't stand by in the past,

141
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:27,700
however, they were published online, so I do understand that perspective.

142
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:33,700
If I was in his position, I would have just released a public statement on Twitter or the community tab when they first arose,

143
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,700
just got something out there.

144
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:39,700
But when something was going as public as it was for him, a video must kinda come into play,

145
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,700
even if it was left a bit too late.

146
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:48,700
I think the purpose of a video at that point would be, if done right, to make sure that the other perspectives don't outshine his own,

147
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:53,700
because these criticisms were gaining traction and people wanna know if he genuinely still held those views.

148
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:58,700
There was also an old video going round of him allegedly fat shaming someone with quote,

149
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:03,700
too much personality, a rather mean-spirited video in which he mocked someone purchasing some food.

150
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:08,700
The video was around 6 years old and posted onto his YouTube channel, and he was revealing stick for this as well.

151
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:12,700
This is what happens when you have too much personality.

152
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:20,700
The reason that I've covered these topics from earlier on in his career are because these are things that could easily be quashed.

153
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:24,700
If these were the only claims, then his response would be straightforward.

154
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:29,700
He's a changed man, he realises the errors of his ways, and he won't be doing it again.

155
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:33,700
And in a way, that did happen, but it was missing some details.

156
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,700
So let's discuss his response.

157
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:43,700
So the first thing that Oxhorn did was remove the incriminating evidence.

158
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:49,700
Now, on principle, that is the right thing to do, as keeping them up can be seen as an implicit endorsement,

159
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:55,700
and when some people started criticising him for it, some fans and their defences of him were mildly concerning.

160
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:59,700
Why would I be scared of a faggot, boo motherfucker?

161
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:04,700
If you don't have the same ideology, you wouldn't want it spreading, or providing the impression that you think that way.

162
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:10,700
However, as I'm sure many of you know, these articles are typically archived by people, so the information is still out there.

163
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:15,700
However, for his domain, which contained his manifesto, I went to search it up, as you do,

164
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:20,700
and he actually placed a special request with the web archives to make sure you couldn't archive it,

165
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:23,700
which is admittedly a bit of a weird move.

166
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:28,700
I mean, alright, you don't want something out there, but as long as people already have screenshots,

167
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:35,700
it seems strange that you would try and completely bury its existence, especially when it was just a fraction of the criticism.

168
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:40,700
It does make you wonder what else was on there, but I digress, we cannot prove anything.

169
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:46,700
However, with the existence of questions surrounding his mentality, it made sense that he'd finally do a video addressing these claims.

170
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:52,700
As mentioned, it should have been a fairly simple dispatch of various points against him, and the comprehension that your positions have changed,

171
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,700
and on first glance, the video does that.

172
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:59,700
When I watched it first, I was pretty much done with the drama, and it seems many commenters would want over too,

173
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:02,700
but when I returned one more time, things didn't seem quite right.

174
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:07,700
I mean, he deals with the previous positions on homosexuality fairly reasonably, as mentioned,

175
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:11,700
although he could have dealt with it sooner, placed an explanation in somewhere,

176
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:15,700
not doing so doesn't make him a bad person if he considered those views in the past,

177
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:21,700
and given the very rapid expansion of his YouTube channel, he might just not really want to bring attention to it.

178
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:24,700
So with that one out the way, suddenly, something clicked.

179
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:57,700
Some viewers told me that this wasn't very kind, and upon reflection I agreed, and so I deleted the video.

180
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:04,700
It got only a handful of views before I deleted it, but as is the nature of the internet, nothing ever truly disappears from the internet,

181
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:08,700
and so trolls have dug up this very old video in an attempt to harm me.

182
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:12,700
Ok, but that's almost completely false.

183
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:15,700
There have been claims about the girl's age, but that's not verifiable.

184
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:20,700
What we do know is that this video was uploaded to YouTube and quickly became one of his most viewed videos at the time,

185
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:23,700
and was still up on his channel after three days.

186
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:28,700
This is not ambiguous, this is archived, which makes me wonder if he knew it was archived.

187
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:33,700
And sure, people confuse details, when you're making comments as if they're solidified responses,

188
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:37,700
and playing it down as if that's a defence, then you cannot allow for that.

189
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:44,700
It's also noteworthy that all the details that Oxhorn gets wrong are details that would immediately play down the severity of such incidents,

190
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:49,700
and honestly, there is an inkling of suspicion in me that he does actually know how the incident went down.

191
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:53,700
The only thing that completely bewilders me is why on earth would he lie about it?

192
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:58,700
As far as I can tell, even if what he did has stayed up for a year and got 50,000 views,

193
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:02,700
an apology would have perfectly quelled any irritation that people felt about the incident.

194
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:06,700
It seems like a way to frame his mentality as impulsive, rather than what it actually was.

195
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:10,700
You can regret mentalities, you don't have to bend the truth.

196
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:14,700
On top of this, prior to the video, when asked about it in his Discord, he said it was a Twitter video.

197
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,700
Is he trolling? This is a bruh moment.

198
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:23,700
Alright, so that was a bit of a strange explanation, it had my suspicions raised a little, but life goes on.

199
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:26,700
Can't just throw someone to the dogs for a little misinformation.

200
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:31,700
He then launches into this attack against the people who have been trying to fabricate the claims against him,

201
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,700
some very malicious actors by the looks of it.

202
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:51,700
And then tried to spread around as if I had actually said it.

203
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:56,700
Another guy fabricated a conversation between himself and another big YouTube channel

204
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,700
using the inspect element option of Google Chrome.

205
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:06,700
He was able to just swap out the HTML to have the other YouTube channel say whatever he wanted that YouTube channel to say.

206
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:13,700
In this way, he started creating screenshots, spreading lies saying that this YouTube channel was working on a hit piece against me,

207
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:16,700
and that I had tried to bribe him to not publish that video.

208
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:22,700
These are all lies, and this particular user was even punished by the other members of his Discord server for lying to them.

209
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:30,700
But even though they know that it was a lie, this hasn't stopped other YouTubers from creating video content about these lies as if they could be true.

210
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,700
That's just the way many of these trolls are.

211
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:37,700
They'll use homosexuality and misogyny as weaponized tools to attack another person,

212
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:43,700
but when they're alone, their everyday conversations are rife with racism, sexism, and homophobia.

213
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:47,700
These organized attacks have taken a number of forms over the past few months.

214
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:51,700
The original Discord server where much of this went on collapsed due to internal struggles,

215
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:55,700
and so they've taken up a bunch of other Discord servers where the exact same thing is going on.

216
00:18:55,700 --> 00:19:00,700
It's an organized campaign to try and spin a story that puts me in a negative light.

217
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:04,700
He basically suggests this encompasses the sort of toxic mentality against him,

218
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:11,700
and although I would certainly agree that those people engaging in such behaviour shouldn't be empowered in any sort of way whatsoever,

219
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:14,700
it's also important to look at the criticism and how it might have arisen.

220
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:17,700
Oxhorn says he doesn't have any sort of problem with fair criticism.

221
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:20,700
And people are free to disagree with me about lore.

222
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:25,700
I'll even hop into the comments section and have vigorous debates with people about specific lore topics.

223
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:29,700
As long as everyone is respectful and kind to each other, these can turn into wonderful conversations.

224
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:32,700
And I would say, this has been plaguing a lot of videos I've seen on him.

225
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:36,700
They're all just loaded with the fact that these people do not like Oxhorn,

226
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:41,700
and if you, as a YouTuber, believe he's manipulating his audience into thinking you're inherently toxic,

227
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:44,700
you really want to make sure those videos don't come across that way.

228
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:50,700
Fans will always go into the innocent until proven guilty mindset, even more strongly than most people,

229
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:54,700
and therefore, you have to put forward a decent case without going into too many ad hominems,

230
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,700
even if it's something that lights a fire on you.

231
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:00,700
That's just a side note, and one that I'd try and keep in mind for the future.

232
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:04,700
With that said, even though I don't think they were presented correctly,

233
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:10,700
I wouldn't brand all those who have criticized him as, quote, trolls, and we'll continue that lie of discussion in a moment.

234
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:12,700
Let's continue to watch this.

235
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:16,700
There was one time, for example, when I was doing a video on the Sunset's Hasperilla headquarters,

236
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:20,700
where I saw a Brotherhood of Steel decal on a manila envelope,

237
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:23,700
and I didn't realize at the time that it came from one of my mods.

238
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:27,700
Instead, I assumed that Obsidian had just reused assets from Fallout 3.

239
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:31,700
Obsidian did reuse assets from Fallout 3, they reused a ton of assets.

240
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:36,700
If you go into Michelangelo's sign shop, for example, we find signs from the Capital Wasteland,

241
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:39,700
that should not be in New Vegas at all.

242
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:43,700
However, once viewers made me aware that it was a mod, I immediately went into the comment section

243
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:47,700
and posted a comment correcting my mistake, and I pinned it to the top of the comment section.

244
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:52,700
Alright, so this is referring to the criticism that he was just looking to hate on Obsidian,

245
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:57,700
thus shilling for Bethesda, and although he admits he was wrong about the certain detail,

246
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:00,700
it seems he didn't immediately change it like he said,

247
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:04,700
although it might look like that, you can see that the pinned comment has been quote edited,

248
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:08,700
now people edit pinned comments all the time, I do, that's not a big deal,

249
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:14,700
but that also doesn't mean that the comment was posted immediately before any of these videos at all.

250
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:17,700
There's a screenshot of him replying, dude wow, just wow,

251
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:22,700
in a rather condescending tone to someone who brings this up, which once again makes you wonder.

252
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:26,700
With that said, a majority of his other responses are fairly straightforward,

253
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:31,700
they're mostly relating to Fallout, and I do think a lot of the allegations he received on that front

254
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:36,700
were fairly difficult to really do anything about, and therefore not really worth their weight in discussion.

255
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:39,700
However, he does end the video on a bit of a strange note.

256
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:45,700
I'm publishing this video because people have asked why they've been seeing a flurry of anti-oxhorn videos

257
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:49,700
recommended to them on YouTube, and it's because I'm under a coordinated attack

258
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:52,700
from people who are trying to punish me for playing Fallout 76.

259
00:21:52,700 --> 00:22:05,700
Well don't worry Oxhorn, I don't give a shit about Fallout 76, let's talk about what I do give a shit about.

260
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:20,700
The thing is, although his response sufficed for many people,

261
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:25,700
some felt like he had omitted certain details, he does address them in a pinned comment eventually,

262
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:29,700
but let's discuss the accusations first and then bring it back to that.

263
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:33,700
People have been making videos on Oxhorn for a while, and on principle that's unsurprising,

264
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:39,700
if you're a large creator with some hot opinions and dirty laundry, then yes, people are gonna wanna talk about it,

265
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:42,700
and when I watched some of these videos on him, I wasn't particularly compelled,

266
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:48,700
like as far as I could tell, they were the sort of small YouTuber content that you will find on anyone.

267
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:58,700
I doubt your wife would be okay with you using thumbnails like this, or like this, or like this, or even this one.

268
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:04,700
Oxhorn has stated in his videos to not give in to vices, all while smoking and drinking scotch,

269
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:16,700
but it is easy to let it slide strictly because most people usually don't consider alcohol or smoking to be a drug.

270
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:21,700
I mean, it's not the most persuasive stuff, and as a large YouTuber, it is fairly harmless,

271
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:26,700
which is why it's confusing that Oxhorn has allegedly taken such a hard-line stance against it.

272
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:32,700
There are multiple creators who have come forward claiming that Oxhorn has placed community and or copyright strikes against their videos,

273
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:36,700
and on top of that, has been silencing criticism over this in his comment sections.

274
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:42,700
The first discussed case is the one relating to a YouTuber by the name of Logical Underscore Fallacy,

275
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:47,700
now named Thomas Beckett. He made a video in response to Oxhorn's video defending Fallout 4.

276
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:54,700
As an outsider, it was a fairly confusing video with melodramatic rhetoric that didn't quite feel like it had earned its tone.

277
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:59,700
Maybe Oxhorn could ban me from his channel, but he cannot ban the truth.

278
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:05,700
And this is a new year, this is the year 2018, and this is the year that we fight back.

279
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:10,700
This is the year that we take a stand against frauds like Oxhorn.

280
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:15,700
As said, it's a video by a very small YouTuber that shouldn't really have too much of an impact,

281
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:21,700
and yet surprisingly enough, he was given a community strike for bullying, which is rather bizarre.

282
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:27,700
What is even stranger is then that his channel was taken down despite supposedly not having any additional content on the matter,

283
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:33,700
and with Logical receiving no further information than these emails, which attributed the removal to Oxhorn's complaints.

284
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:39,700
Now, it seems strange to me, personally, that YouTube would actually disclose the plaintiff, so I sought verification of this.

285
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:44,700
Now, I did speak to Logical, to see if he still had a copy of the email, which he said he didn't.

286
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:48,700
But not deterred, I decided to reach out to YouTube, and although they were hesitant at first,

287
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:52,700
once I told them I had permission from the owner, and it was pretty much all public,

288
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:56,700
they did confirm it was legit, so it's not looking good for our friend Brandon here.

289
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:00,700
However, I do say that with the reservation, that in their first response to me,

290
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:06,700
they say they don't typically name people who report other creators, so maybe the guy responding is confused here, I don't know.

291
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:09,700
I'll let you make your own conclusions regardless.

292
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:13,700
One thing that I would say is that, in Oxhorn's response, in his pinned comment,

293
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:17,700
he showed a general ignorance of the reliability of YouTube's system.

294
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:22,700
At the end of the day, we're not trying to necessarily make the judgement of whether the report was right or wrong,

295
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:25,700
we're trying to work out whether this was in good or bad faith.

296
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:28,700
And then we have to discuss the copyright system.

297
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:32,700
Now, Oxhorn has made a flurry of copyright claims in the last few years,

298
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:38,700
most of them on re-uploads of clips, and although I don't necessarily agree with preventing people from being able to see these clips,

299
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:42,700
see my video on Pokimane for that, he's still within his right to take them down.

300
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:47,700
However, one situation stood out, this is one with a creator named Sinon Mercer.

301
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:50,700
Now, he posted two re-uploads of certain clips onto his channel,

302
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:53,700
Oxhorn decided that he was going to get these videos removed,

303
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:59,700
but rather than just claiming them like many YouTubers do, he filed straight up DMCA takedowns,

304
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,700
which deals one strike per video.

305
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:07,700
Now, as said, he is in his right to do this, but it's pretty aggressive, and gives them much less channel mobility,

306
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:12,700
but maybe he just perceived the uploader as having ill intent against him, and therefore it was warranted.

307
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:18,700
So, clearly annoyed at receiving two strikes, Sinon then uploads a more regular quote exposed video.

308
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:21,700
As expected, it's not quite a content cop.

309
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:27,700
What I find ironic about the whole thing, though, is that a real man would admit and fix his mistakes,

310
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:33,700
which Oxhorn doesn't do, despite him claiming that he's so manly.

311
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:37,700
And what Oxhorn does is he goes in for the kill, he files a third takedown notice,

312
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:40,700
that would have terminated Sinon's account altogether.

313
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:46,700
Now, fortunately, through some miracle, YouTube actually intervened and stated that it was fair use,

314
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:49,700
which given how broken the system is, is almost incredible.

315
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:52,700
And with this, Oxhorn had fucked up, big time in fact.

316
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:59,700
Out of anything worth quote exposing him over, this is the closest you get to affirmation that he has the ability to be malicious.

317
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:04,700
Now, Oxhorn did not address this in the video, but he did respond to this in the pinned comment.

318
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:09,700
After stating that all critical channels on him are still up, which is a strange thing to say on principle,

319
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:15,700
because you'll only be able to see the channels that are still up, he then speaks about this specific situation relating to Sinon.

320
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:21,700
He states that the reason he made the stripe was because the video included the use of an animated short

321
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:27,700
that completely removed any real reason to watch his own video because it used the content in almost all its entirety,

322
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:34,700
and it was fine anyhow because YouTube saved him, and therefore he didn't necessarily need to look up the legality himself.

323
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:38,700
So I watched Sinon's video, and surprise surprise, Oxhorn's statement on it is false.

324
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:44,700
In Sinon's video, the animated clip that he uses is just over a minute out of the video which is 8 minutes long,

325
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:52,700
and ironically enough, uploaded in its entirety on someone else's channel where it's been for the last 10 years.

326
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:57,700
And to add insult to this injury, in the complaint that YouTube intervened in,

327
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:03,700
Oxhorn gave different timestamps which didn't even match where Sinon used the animated short in his video,

328
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:07,700
the clip he was complaining about was one where he was just talking in front of a camera.

329
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:12,700
I feel that a defence from Oxhorn is rooted in the point of view that you would have to be pretty petty

330
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:19,700
to go after this sort of exposed video that used information from other exposed videos and was recorded on a potato.

331
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:24,700
He clearly watched it all through, he is reaching Keemstar levels of obsessed.

332
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:30,700
I could barely get through 10 minutes of that video, it seems almost unbelievable, but he clearly did.

333
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:36,700
His point of view is also mixed with the idea that YouTube's system is just working fine and therefore it's not a big deal.

334
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:40,700
Nothing bad happened, even though his strike could have led to channel deletion.

335
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:46,700
The system is completely dysfunctional, and this has been broken for ages, even PewDiePie has been struck,

336
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:53,700
and YouTube didn't magically detect it, and this has happened again and again, anyone in commentary knows this.

337
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:58,700
The difference is when larger channels are struck, they can stand up for themselves, smaller channels don't have that,

338
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:04,700
and someone like Sinon would have never got their channel back, and that whole attempt to strike was reckless at best.

339
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:08,700
It makes the narrative that he'd do that to another channel much more plausible,

340
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:13,700
and his retrospective framing of the situation is misleading, more than forgetfulness can explain.

341
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:15,700
And speaking of misleading,

342
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:23,700
a lot of videos that have attacked Oxhorn have focused on a lot, which in my opinion is explainable,

343
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:26,700
even if Oxhorn himself has not explained them the best.

344
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:32,700
On principle, I don't think that someone should have their career ended for a load of old content that we've discussed today,

345
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:35,700
even if in hindsight it was done in rather poor taste.

346
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:43,700
There was a video uploaded called Defending Oxhorn, released by YouTuber Average Betas, who brand themselves as comedians.

347
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:46,700
Anyhow, in this one video, it is just a single bloke,

348
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:50,700
and throughout the first half of the video, he makes these sorts of defences that I've referred to,

349
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:53,700
and although I think they could have been a bit more well researched,

350
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:58,700
and people were giving him far too much credit for a line that was Jack from the Simpsons, I think.

351
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:02,700
Nobody's perfect, that's why they put erasers on pencils.

352
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:06,700
Everybody makes mistakes, that's why they put erasers on pencils.

353
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:11,700
His points weren't really that incorrect, that is until he gets to copyright,

354
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:18,700
and a lot of people have been going around citing this as a defence against the attacks that Oxhorn has been receiving,

355
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:25,700
and I don't think I can quite do justice for how bad I personally believe this next set of argumentation is,

356
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:31,700
so I think it's time to turn this into a little collab, and who else better served to cover this than my good friend, John Swan.

357
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:34,700
I suggest we bring him in, take it away my friend.

358
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:38,700
Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the writer pit- wait that is not the intro.

359
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:44,700
Hello everyone, Tro has asked me to cover this joke of a video, specifically the points relating to fair use.

360
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:49,700
I've studied copyright law quite extensively, so it's only fitting that the person who made this video,

361
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:52,700
Average Betas, starts off this section talking about copyright,

362
00:30:52,700 --> 00:31:00,700
stating that he's not a lawyer, but that he can give a YouTuber's perspectives on the events surrounding Oxhorn and his copyright related incidents,

363
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:03,700
specifically on matters related to fair use.

364
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:07,700
Let's watch along and see what he has to say, I'm sure it's incredibly insightful.

365
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:15,700
However, I can speak from a YouTuber's perspective and give you what I know about striking channels, and what I know about fair use.

366
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:19,700
If for instance, someone steals my content and tries to pass it off as their own, then I can strike their channel.

367
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:25,700
If someone takes some of my paid content, like for instance something I put on Patreon, and they show it on their channel for free, I can strike their channel.

368
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:30,700
If a person takes private content of mine and shows it on their channel, I can strike their channel.

369
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:34,700
Wait, what? That's completely untrue.

370
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:37,700
Now, his language is a bit convoluted here.

371
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:44,700
He uses the word show, and doesn't specify whether this showing involves the content being used in an expose work of some kind,

372
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:47,700
or whether the content is just re-uploaded.

373
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:54,700
However, judging from statements further on in the video, I'm going to have to go with the conclusion that he means showing in any capacity whatsoever.

374
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:57,700
So, let's break this down.

375
00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:06,700
He is very correct when he says that these cases are not necessarily against fair use, because these uses are definitely fair in many contexts.

376
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:11,700
But he's completely incorrect in stating that these uses are against YouTube's terms of service.

377
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:17,700
If we read YouTube's terms of service, we see nothing here relating to the topics which he has discussed.

378
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:22,700
But let's just say he made a mistake, and he meant to say the community guidelines terms.

379
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:26,700
But wait, nothing in there says anything about these topics either.

380
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:31,700
In fact, no document published by YouTube says anything about posting content behind a paywall,

381
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:39,700
or posting content that is not publicly available, aside from their copyright related documents, of which fair use is a valid defense.

382
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:41,700
Let's keep on watching here.

383
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:02,700
This is a major problem with these points.

384
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:10,700
I think average Batters is under the impression that content that is not published isn't protected by the same copyright laws as a published work,

385
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:13,700
in which case he would be unconditionally wrong.

386
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:22,700
Unpublished works hold the same copyright status as published works, and therefore are governed by the same fair use clauses as published works.

387
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:27,700
Furthermore, this has also been proved by multiple court cases on the subject.

388
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,700
He goes off on a similar tangent here.

389
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:36,700
...would be considered under copyright law, and are protected under fair use.

390
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:40,700
This means a private video of me at the beach with my family is not fair use.

391
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:47,700
Nor is any other private footage I don't make publicly available for entertainment consumption and copyright the works.

392
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:52,700
Just like how a deleted video on Facebook isn't under fair use, as far as I'm aware, I'm not a lawyer.

393
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:54,700
Yeah mate, we can easily tell that you're not a lawyer.

394
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,700
And again, completely incorrect.

395
00:33:56,700 --> 00:34:00,700
And just shows how much this particular individual knows about fair use.

396
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:04,700
He didn't even bother to do a quick Google search to verify what he's talking about.

397
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:08,700
Another misinformed statement that completely manipulates the narrative is this one.

398
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:15,700
If I were to try to strike a channel that was using my content under fair use, or wasn't doing anything wrong,

399
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:22,700
and YouTube reviewed the strike and saw I was in the wrong, that I was falsely claiming something against that channel,

400
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:24,700
I would risk losing my channel.

401
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:27,700
This is, once again, completely incorrect.

402
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:33,700
To submit a DMCA strike on YouTube, you have to acknowledge that the strike is being made in good faith.

403
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:39,700
No one, aside from the individual who submitted the strike, could genuinely verify whether the strike was made in good faith,

404
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:42,700
especially when it is a grey area.

405
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:48,700
YouTube can't generally step in when strikes are made, since they have to maintain their Safe Harbor status.

406
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:55,700
Safe Harbor is a provision in US copyright law that states that services like YouTube are not legally responsible

407
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:58,700
for the uploading of unlicensed content by their users.

408
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:03,700
There have been circumstances where it was pretty easily determined that a strike was not made in good faith,

409
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:09,700
specifically if an account has been deemed as suspicious, however, for the most part, it doesn't occur.

410
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:13,700
Since it is difficult to tell whether a strike was made in good faith,

411
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:17,700
the channels that submit the strikes don't usually have consequences levelled against them,

412
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:22,700
and thus this claim, made by average batters, is a big stretch to say the least.

413
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:27,700
If someone posted a video about me and how they don't like my videos, then who cares, have at it, go nuts.

414
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:30,700
I just had at it. It was very entertaining.

415
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:36,700
Thank you for being a buffoon and gracing us with this discrepant conglomeration of Boulder Dash. Much appreciated.

416
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:41,700
Thank you so much, Jon. I hope he's cleared up any qualms that can be found in the video.

417
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:47,700
I'm going to leave his channel in the pinned comment, I'd definitely recommend checking his work out if you enjoy that sort of analysis,

418
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:50,700
though he needs to upload more, so make sure you go and let him know that.

419
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:57,700
To average batters, I apologise for Jon's butchering of your name, but you did butcher copyright law, so we'll consider it even.

420
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:03,700
However, with all this in mind, I want to begin to tie things up, though admittedly it's quite a lot to do.

421
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:17,700
In his response video, Oxhorn placed his critics into a collective who were all conspiring against him,

422
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:21,700
and although I would agree that some of these guys clearly have ties to each other,

423
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:29,700
I think they've more been united by their negative experiences with Oxhorn rather than being united prior to simulating negative experiences,

424
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:33,700
and maybe originally it was born out of his opinions on Fallout.

425
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:39,700
When you say something that is unpopular and kinda side him with the corporation, you're gonna get people who think you're shills,

426
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:43,700
and when watching some of the oldest videos on him, that's certainly how it comes across,

427
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:49,700
but eventually this manifested when people started to think that he'd overstepped his jurisdiction in responding to these,

428
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:54,700
and his attempt to finish off Simon Mercer's channel was probably where the cynicism peaked.

429
00:36:54,700 --> 00:37:00,700
He really doesn't like people bringing attention to this stuff, and on principle, I get it, if you have something you're ashamed of,

430
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:05,700
then you don't want to be continuously dragged over it. Equally, you don't want people to look you up,

431
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:10,700
and that to be their first impression of you, you want them to be clear, that's not what you believe.

432
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:14,700
I think that's happened to a majority of creators on this platform, myself included,

433
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:19,700
but there's nothing you can really do than release a statement and roll with a few punches here and there.

434
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:26,700
There will be people with perceptions of you that aren't quite current or accurate, just make sure that doesn't become prevalent.

435
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:32,700
Twisting the truth in subsequent responses will inevitably come back to harm you because people will perceive it as dishonesty,

436
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:37,700
and trying to cover up these things makes people question if you really understand the gravity or the consequences,

437
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:40,700
or even feel remorse for them in the first place.

438
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:45,700
There's been a lot of evidence that Oxhorn is deleting comments on his newest video when people present counter-narratives,

439
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:49,700
such as the disparity between the YouTube comment count and Social Blade comment count,

440
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:54,700
as Social Blade updates after, implying that comments were being deleted post-publication,

441
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:58,700
even ones that seem reasonable, just coincidentally being against him.

442
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:04,700
Assumedly, a lot of people are being hidden from the channel too, and it seems he really wants to restrict the scope

443
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:07,700
of what's being said to those who are basically praising him.

444
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:10,700
And although it's his channel, he can do what he wants,

445
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:15,700
when you're so desperate to hide something rather than just making sure the public understand all the context,

446
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:18,700
people wonder what you've got to hide.

447
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:24,700
On top of this, there was another account that has been defending Oxhorn in comment sections named KK,

448
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:28,700
which was funnily enough created four days after the Oxhorn channel,

449
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:33,700
and it's only subscribed to him, with no other activity in the last eight years.

450
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:37,700
Although it's not impossible someone might have just come over from the Oxhorn Movies channel,

451
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:41,700
it is probably an alt. Loads of YouTubers set them up under brand accounts

452
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:45,700
because back in the day, it was an easy way to upvote videos in case they got bombed.

453
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:50,700
As a side note, can people start referencing in the description or the pinned comment?

454
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:52,700
Why did you put it on screen? Are you a boomer, mate?

455
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:56,700
I think Oxhorn, like some other creators I've encountered in the past,

456
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:59,700
really overestimate the sensitivity of an audience,

457
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:04,700
and just try and completely shield them from possible transgressions they may have committed.

458
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:07,700
It started as an attempt to remove some of the incriminating videos,

459
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:10,700
and it's clearly gone over the line,

460
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:12,700
and then when the videos became too much to handle,

461
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:17,700
he made a response video and a response comment where he somewhat addresses the claims,

462
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:22,700
but similarly downplays some and misrepresents others to preserve the image.

463
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:26,700
But I really think if he just said what had happened and just apologised,

464
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:28,700
then this wouldn't have prolonged any further.

465
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:31,700
Most audiences just want to enjoy the creators,

466
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:34,700
and be comfortable knowing they're supporting people who aren't terrible.

467
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:39,700
Most people's bars aren't that high for past political and moral standards,

468
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:41,700
especially if you're a Fallout YouTuber.

469
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:46,700
To add to this, I understand why there are a surprisingly high number of people who want me to cover this,

470
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:49,700
and I don't doubt they've probably reached out to get other creators as well,

471
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:52,700
but I think that people have been hesitant to pick this up

472
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:56,700
because a lot of the videos are hard to follow in exactly what they've been trying to say,

473
00:39:56,700 --> 00:40:00,700
and bogged down in these sort of trivial points which tend to suppress the impact.

474
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:04,700
It's kinda allowed Oxhorn to jump on the narrative that these people are toxic,

475
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:08,700
and although some people clearly are, they're not without their legitimate criticisms,

476
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:14,700
and going as far as to end channels over it is quite ridiculous considering the quality of these videos in question.

477
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:19,700
I have a hunch if he'd never reacted in the first place, we wouldn't be sitting here having this discussion today.

478
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:25,700
And this isn't to say I think Oxhorn is a fantastic bloke who just needs a bit of good advice.

479
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:29,700
Some of his old articles could be somewhat reflective of a mentality he might still hold,

480
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:32,700
they come across as rather narcissistic,

481
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:36,700
and as someone who personally also deals with a bit too much narcissism from time to time,

482
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:41,700
I understand that you get the impression that people are completely out for you with bad intent,

483
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:45,700
and you just wanna wish they would shut up presenting this perspective which just isn't you anymore,

484
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:48,700
I completely get that, but Striking is not the answer,

485
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:52,700
you gotta channel that into something better and showing them that you are better than them.

486
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:55,700
Striking doesn't do that, it does completely the opposite,

487
00:40:55,700 --> 00:41:00,700
and for what has been done, I would apologise and be grateful that you still have your channel,

488
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:02,700
but hey, that's just what I think.

489
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:07,700
Maybe it's not easy to have sympathy for people who you perceive as acting with ill intent.

490
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:12,700
For me though, I would never assume that someone has that intent inside of them just because they're against me.

491
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:16,700
Have I dealt with people with ill intent? Sure, but it's not worth making that assumption.

492
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:21,700
I know a lot of people have a real emotional connection to their channel, and to these causes,

493
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:25,700
and I wouldn't risk depriving them of that just because they said some mean things about me,

494
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:28,700
which is what it came down to, and I've tried to be nice to Oxhorn today

495
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:34,700
because I don't want to present a binary choice to people who may enjoy his content and his personality.

496
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:40,700
Do they either have to agree with the criticisms and thus hate him, or disagree with all of them and love him,

497
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:46,700
because then people will reverse the formula and derive their positions on the criticisms from how much they like their YouTubers,

498
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:49,700
and you can never really find any resolution there.

499
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:53,700
The truth is, when these things are brought up, people are prepared to forgive.

500
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:58,700
If people are calling you out, most audiences won't just hear that and assume you're evil from now on,

501
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:00,700
they want to hear your perspective.

502
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:07,700
This situation has spiralled beyond anyone's comprehension, and I want to address it because there are some real messages to take away from it.

503
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:14,700
If you're not a non, or other variances, audiences aren't going to crucify you if you're honest and upfront about your mistakes.

504
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:20,700
Don't try and destroy smaller channels because they make videos on you. Smaller channels aren't going to destroy your career,

505
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:25,700
they're more just a way to casually keep your ego in check, even if their criticisms aren't the best.

506
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:29,700
They're normally rooted in some sentiment that you can link back to a point.

507
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:34,700
If those criticisms aren't legitimate, then you can ignore them, and chances are they won't gain traction.

508
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:37,700
If they are legitimate, they probably won't gain that much traction either.

509
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:42,700
Just keep them in mind, address them in a post if you need to, then at least you've established your position.

510
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:50,700
I don't support cancel culture, but you can't go in the absolute opposite direction and attempt to just wipe out any evidence of these things happening,

511
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:54,700
because it doesn't change the fact that they happened, and people will still reflect on them.

512
00:42:54,700 --> 00:43:00,700
There is a lot that I haven't spoken about that other channels have, and generally that's because I don't think it adds to the narrative.

513
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:06,700
People have said and done stuff on the internet, which we will be asked about, sometimes called out for.

514
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:13,700
What matters is that we don't try and let the paranoia about presenting a squeaky clean image drive us to attempt to silence those voices,

515
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:16,700
even if we think those voices are wrong or misled.

516
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:25,700
So yes, we are at the end of the video again, I want to give a big shoutout to the editors who have done a fantastic job as ever,

517
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:30,700
I'm gonna leave their links in the pinned comment below, definitely go and check them out.

518
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:34,700
Also, would love to hear your thoughts on this video, on the topic, it's an interesting one for sure,

519
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:38,700
I'm sure a lot of my viewers do not know about it, but I wanted to have a discussion over it,

520
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:44,700
because sometimes it's good to bring these things to light, even if it's not too much of a common occurrence on my channel.

521
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:49,700
I also want to give a big shoutout to my Patreons, thank you again, some of them are on screen right now,

522
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:59,700
you guys are great, thanks to my $50 Patreon, Sumhala Baloo, and my $200 Patreons, Brandon and Evening Steel,

523
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:03,700
your generosity is truly appreciated. Thank you guys very much.

524
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:07,700
I don't have too much else to add today, if you want to find me, you can reach me on Twitter,

525
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:14,700
at The Right Opinion, Facebook too, Discord as well, I'm fairly accessible, I like to think so at least,

526
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:19,700
but other than that, I don't really have too much else to say, so I guess I'll just leave it here.

527
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:22,700
I'm The Right Opinion, and I'll see you in the next one.

528
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:45,700
Thanks for watching!
