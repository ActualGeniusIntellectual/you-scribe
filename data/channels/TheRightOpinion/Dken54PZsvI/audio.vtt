00:00.000 --> 00:13.700
Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time.

00:13.700 --> 00:20.500
And I like video games. In fact, back in the day, I used to be a big gamer. However, contrary to the slogan,

00:20.500 --> 00:25.500
which I pretty much retain for branding purposes at this point, I do not have much free time, and therefore,

00:25.500 --> 00:30.700
I do not play as many video games as I'd like. One of the games, or series of games, I've always wanted to play,

00:30.700 --> 00:37.000
but never quite got round to was Fallout. It seems like a fascinating concept, the dystopian, open world adventure

00:37.000 --> 00:42.800
really captures my attention. Fallout as a game series has been going on for a few decades, and with critical

00:42.800 --> 00:48.600
acclaim and popularity, it quickly obtained a substantial fan base which spilled over into the internet gaming

00:48.600 --> 00:53.100
scene, and launched the careers of a lot of creators. It's not just the gameplay of Fallout that seems to attract

00:53.100 --> 00:57.700
a lot of attention, but it's also the lore, the stories, and the mystery, in a way. When playing games,

00:57.700 --> 01:02.900
we might experience something that provokes a question in our head, makes us think, I wonder what the story is

01:02.900 --> 01:08.000
behind them. And like creators who delve into the mysteries of the internet, for example, the gaming equivalent

01:08.000 --> 01:12.700
of these creators gain prominence with the same sort of approach, talking about the mysterious backgrounds

01:12.700 --> 01:18.500
of some characters, and out of the roots came a YouTuber known as Oxhorn, the Fallout lore investigator

01:18.500 --> 01:24.200
with a creamy voice. His videos delving into various cases, stories, and features, most prominently gained

01:24.200 --> 01:30.700
traction over the 2017-2018 period. Now this wasn't Oxhorn's first venture on the platform, in fact he is

01:30.700 --> 01:35.300
one of the older creators as the platform's history goes, prior to the Oxhorn channel he had a channel

01:35.300 --> 01:40.700
named Oxhorn Movies, in which he uploaded World of Warcraft related content, which was certainly interesting

01:40.700 --> 01:41.900
to say the least.

01:41.900 --> 01:57.900
This has 17 million views by the way, good luck ever obtaining that sort of success with this sort of content.

01:57.900 --> 02:03.400
He made the comment that he started making movies in around 2004, and therefore he must have pre-existed

02:03.400 --> 02:09.200
the platform with his interests, however in 2013 he decided it was time to move on from this brand of content

02:09.200 --> 02:15.000
and into other ventures. He had a podcast that he called Scotch and Smoke Rings, he also had a website

02:15.000 --> 02:21.500
where he advertised beard care, grow a beard now, and he had his own personal blog, bloggingwithclass.com.

02:21.500 --> 02:26.600
Now when someone's on the internet for such a long time, it's natural that they've probably got a lot of history,

02:26.600 --> 02:32.000
a lot of pages up there that documents their journey, however sometimes when we look over a person's journey,

02:32.000 --> 02:37.000
we see a few potholes they may have encountered, and we want to know how they would address it.

02:37.000 --> 02:42.400
These are two separate processes that can definitely shape the perception of a creator and the possible implications

02:42.400 --> 02:48.300
regarding their reputation. There's a lot more to the drama than meets the eye, but I found myself being contacted

02:48.300 --> 02:53.700
a lot about this, and I was to be honest quite confused, because drama has a rather straightforward formula,

02:53.700 --> 02:58.500
one side presents their case, another side presents their case, and then the beleaguered, bewildered audience

02:58.500 --> 03:04.300
try and pick a side on the basis of what truths they can hopefully take away, and this isn't anything particularly

03:04.300 --> 03:09.600
huge on the surface. Why would people want me to do a video on this bloke, as far as I could see,

03:09.600 --> 03:13.900
a fairly inoffensive fallout channel that isn't pulling so many views these days?

03:13.900 --> 03:19.100
Well when I began to spend more time researching content and watching the videos on it, I very quickly realised

03:19.100 --> 03:23.300
why people were messaging me, because the truths that I just spoke about, they're not really clear.

03:23.300 --> 03:27.700
The videos on him were long, I mean very long, and some of you creators clearly didn't get the memo,

03:27.700 --> 03:32.500
because only I'm allowed to do long videos with pretentious rants, but I watched them because the right opinion

03:32.500 --> 03:38.300
is a trooper, out on the front lines, watching the videos, so you don't have to. But now we've set the scene,

03:38.300 --> 03:44.100
I want to lay out the situation, because I know a lot of you guys will probably not have a clue what I'm talking about.

03:44.100 --> 03:46.900
Don't worry, Papa James is here to enlighten you.

03:46.900 --> 03:53.700
So Oxhorn has appeared to have been embroiled in drama over a rather murky time period, at first it appeared to just be

03:53.700 --> 03:58.700
criticism of his content and some of the coverage of Fallout games, but his response to this criticism,

03:58.700 --> 04:03.900
which we'll get into in a moment, appeared to rub people the wrong way, and what happens is what you'd expect,

04:03.900 --> 04:07.700
he made a few enemies, and internet history and enemies don't go too well.

04:07.700 --> 04:12.900
What these people found was his blog, which had some fairly questionable views and propaganda published,

04:12.900 --> 04:18.900
they found some of his old tweets, some articles that he had written himself on various matters, including homosexuality,

04:18.900 --> 04:25.100
and on top of this they found other videos that showed him not quite as the sort of person he presents himself today.

04:25.100 --> 04:31.100
This was piled alongside what many thought was his biased coverage of games such as Fallout 76 and Fallout 4,

04:31.100 --> 04:35.300
and that led to suspicions of whether he had ulterior motives for supporting it.

04:35.300 --> 04:39.700
On the surface, it created the narrative that he might be a homophobe with a bad taste in games,

04:39.700 --> 04:45.700
but digging deeper, some people felt it made much of his content disingenuous, and that he was just an opportunist,

04:45.700 --> 04:50.300
espousing the views that got him the ad rev. At first there was little public response from Oxhorn,

04:50.300 --> 04:55.700
however, as the pressure continued to melt, and people began to question whether he still held some of his positions,

04:55.700 --> 05:01.300
he decided to upload a public response, replying to the allegations, and going on the counter on many points,

05:01.300 --> 05:07.500
claiming that his critics were mostly bad faith actors obsessed with bringing a harmless guy who made a few mistakes down.

05:07.500 --> 05:12.300
This was met with support from many viewers who praised him for his calm, collected response to criticism,

05:12.300 --> 05:16.100
however, there were still a sect of people who were unconvinced about his response,

05:16.100 --> 05:20.500
and claimed that actually he had a habit of being quite authoritarian towards criticism,

05:20.500 --> 05:24.700
and actually had not just taken down videos, but whole channels over this matter,

05:24.700 --> 05:28.500
pretty much attempting to erase the history of his questionable behaviour.

05:28.500 --> 05:35.100
This is a lot to digest, and honestly, the journey through the drama is one like a huge rollercoaster,

05:35.100 --> 05:38.500
and if you get to a point in my video where you think you know which side I'm gonna take,

05:38.500 --> 05:40.300
I might suggest staying a little longer.

05:40.300 --> 05:44.300
But to do that, I think we need to get back into the right style.

05:45.300 --> 05:48.300
Are you ready? Let's go.

05:57.300 --> 06:01.100
I'm going to preface this by saying I'm not going to talk about Fallout a lot,

06:01.100 --> 06:06.300
because it's not my main area of expertise, and frankly there is so much discussion on it already.

06:06.300 --> 06:10.100
No, what I'm going to do is break down this drama into the section of allegations,

06:10.100 --> 06:13.900
starting with the stuff that I don't think is really the strongest, but the oldest,

06:13.900 --> 06:16.900
and you'll understand why I do that by the end of this part.

06:16.900 --> 06:20.500
As mentioned, when you've been on the internet for a long time like Oxhorn,

06:20.500 --> 06:23.900
chances are you've said some things that you wouldn't say in the present day.

06:23.900 --> 06:29.500
This may be due to a change in ideology, or just the acknowledgement that it's inappropriate for your current format.

06:29.500 --> 06:34.300
This recently came about with his blog posts, a few topics stuck out, firstly about porn,

06:34.300 --> 06:38.300
secondly about homosexuality, and thirdly about substances.

06:38.300 --> 06:43.300
Now, Oxhorn at the time of these posts, by the looks of it, was a person who was pretty invested in Christianity,

06:43.300 --> 06:49.900
however, he takes a sort of Shapiro approach, doesn't really use the God said so, and tries to find some logical explanation.

06:49.900 --> 06:55.700
In this instance, some of the bases of his arguments are applied through the perspective of prevention of societal decay,

06:55.700 --> 07:01.700
and others are applied through Darwinism, and used to explain why the behaviour is immoral or undesirable,

07:01.700 --> 07:04.100
as it's not evolutionarily preferable.

07:04.500 --> 07:16.500
Anyway, so that, from a Darwinistic perspective, from the perspective of an animal that has evolved from the protozoa,

07:16.500 --> 07:22.500
or whatever, to the creature that stands before you naked and shivering now, the man,

07:22.500 --> 07:28.500
that is a man who has failed at being an animal.

07:28.500 --> 07:35.500
Animals don't run around and look at other naked animals and get their jollies that way, they really don't.

07:35.500 --> 07:44.500
That's really something that is only in mankind, you know, you don't see nude badger periodicals in the bookstore,

07:44.500 --> 07:52.500
you don't, I mean that's just weird, you're not gonna find badgers lined up to buy the latest edition of Badger Boy, or whatever, Play Badger.

07:52.500 --> 07:56.100
I mean, primates can masturbate too mate, but I wouldn't go too far into that.

07:56.100 --> 08:02.100
The content criticizing homosexuality was written over a decade ago on Camera Of Truth on Blogspot,

08:02.100 --> 08:05.700
where he basically posted articles that read like Craigoyou transcripts.

08:05.700 --> 08:12.100
The other content was published around 2013 time in Oxhorn's very quaintly named Manly Festo,

08:12.100 --> 08:20.100
which appears to be a guide on how to behave with class, like Oxhorn of course, he was the embodiment of a refined gentleman.

08:20.100 --> 08:25.900
Now I'm being quite jovial about this because I find it quite funny, not gonna lie, maybe it's just the sentiment of it,

08:25.900 --> 08:34.500
that there is this guru of class passing on his wisdom to the on-looking plebeians, such as thou shalt not beat their meat,

08:34.500 --> 08:37.900
but I'll put this on hold to go to the homosexuality point.

08:37.900 --> 08:42.900
So he wrote a few posts back in the day about homosexuality, I found them quite amusing,

08:42.900 --> 08:50.300
but the central tone is that homosexuality is immoral, and if society deems it immoral, then they can discriminate it on the basis of morality.

08:50.300 --> 08:57.100
This led to claims that he held outdated, bigoted views, he also tweeted out some articles and responses on his twitter at the time.

08:57.100 --> 09:00.300
I'm not here to debate it, because he's already retracted it.

09:00.300 --> 09:05.700
The thing is, although he comes across as rather self-righteous, it's easy to forget that gay marriage,

09:05.700 --> 09:11.700
and even remote acceptance of homosexual relationships has only really become mainstream in the last few years,

09:11.700 --> 09:18.900
and therefore I don't think it's really a thing worth exposing someone over, because it wasn't an uncommon belief back then,

09:18.900 --> 09:21.900
especially if you've been raised in a very restrictive environment.

09:21.900 --> 09:27.700
With that said, I think people who may feel alienated by such views can take up their concern with him,

09:27.700 --> 09:31.700
and he can explain how he feels today, a bridge we will cross soon.

09:31.700 --> 09:36.100
The whole porn and substances thing led to a lot of allegations that he was hypocritical,

09:36.100 --> 09:40.100
the porn thing because he has mods that enable nudity in his Fallout games,

09:40.100 --> 09:50.700
and his comments on substances because he is a frequent drinker and smoker.

09:50.700 --> 09:55.900
Now, as far as the porn goes, I mean he did kinda qualify his statements a few years back.

09:55.900 --> 10:03.700
There are people in real life who do get sex, and still watch pornography and masturbate,

10:03.700 --> 10:10.700
but that's for a different discussion, we're not talking about sex in general, we're talking about satisfying sex,

10:10.700 --> 10:13.700
and I get that into the article when we talk about marriage.

10:13.700 --> 10:19.700
And it's hard to say if they're completely equivalent, although it's still a bit strange given his dispositions,

10:19.700 --> 10:21.700
he does comment on it in his response video.

10:21.700 --> 10:27.700
As for the comments on substances, although fairly disagreeable for myself, it's a case of what society has constructed,

10:27.700 --> 10:32.700
and a lot of Oxhorn's views are clearly rooted in traditionalism of what is best for society,

10:32.700 --> 10:37.700
and a lot of the substances that Oxhorn frowns upon are those ones that are classically ostracised,

10:37.700 --> 10:40.700
for reasons some more rational than others.

10:40.700 --> 10:44.700
It's not exactly hypocritical to decry them, as snobbish as it might seem.

10:44.700 --> 10:50.700
Now, what his reasoning for sacrificing these views over the last year, we've heard a few responses from him,

10:50.700 --> 10:52.700
in his response video that we'll break down later.

10:52.700 --> 10:59.700
This moment changed many beliefs that I held. After all, if I could have been so wrong about homosexuality,

10:59.700 --> 11:04.700
I could be just as wrong about the politics that I held, and my views on other social issues,

11:04.700 --> 11:13.700
making nearly everything that I wrote in my 20s and early 30s outdated, and not an accurate representation of the person I am today.

11:13.700 --> 11:17.700
And people can say that he's being disingenuous, and that he's afraid of losing fans,

11:17.700 --> 11:22.700
but as it stands currently, I could not say for certain that those were his motives,

11:22.700 --> 11:28.700
and although I do find the posts amusing, I wouldn't advocate dragging someone over them if they have expressed regret for them,

11:28.700 --> 11:31.700
those were his opinions, he doesn't hold them anymore.

11:31.700 --> 11:37.700
At the end of the day, when I'm doing any sort of activist work, my ultimate goal would be to convince people to change,

11:37.700 --> 11:42.700
and if he's outwardly changed his views, then that at least is a message that he's conveying to his audience,

11:42.700 --> 11:44.700
and that's a positive at least.

11:44.700 --> 11:49.700
There was also a lot of criticism that he shills for Bethesda, basically, due to some misinformation in his videos,

11:49.700 --> 11:53.700
particularly in the fact that he was defending Fallout 4 and even 76.

11:53.700 --> 11:58.700
As said, I can't really comment on it, there's not really much that can be proved either way,

11:58.700 --> 12:00.700
we don't have any bank receipts, unfortunately.

12:00.700 --> 12:04.700
He might have his reasons for supporting it, but it's not the central issue here.

12:04.700 --> 12:08.700
There were also some people criticizing him for not making a video unprovoked,

12:08.700 --> 12:11.700
having to receive all these allegations to actually respond,

12:11.700 --> 12:17.700
and although I do understand that perspective, it would seem weird to me to make a video unprovoked on previous views,

12:17.700 --> 12:19.700
if no one was really thinking about them.

12:19.700 --> 12:23.700
I think many people have had views they don't stand by in the past,

12:23.700 --> 12:27.700
however, they were published online, so I do understand that perspective.

12:27.700 --> 12:33.700
If I was in his position, I would have just released a public statement on Twitter or the community tab when they first arose,

12:33.700 --> 12:35.700
just got something out there.

12:35.700 --> 12:39.700
But when something was going as public as it was for him, a video must kinda come into play,

12:39.700 --> 12:41.700
even if it was left a bit too late.

12:41.700 --> 12:48.700
I think the purpose of a video at that point would be, if done right, to make sure that the other perspectives don't outshine his own,

12:48.700 --> 12:53.700
because these criticisms were gaining traction and people wanna know if he genuinely still held those views.

12:53.700 --> 12:58.700
There was also an old video going round of him allegedly fat shaming someone with quote,

12:58.700 --> 13:03.700
too much personality, a rather mean-spirited video in which he mocked someone purchasing some food.

13:03.700 --> 13:08.700
The video was around 6 years old and posted onto his YouTube channel, and he was revealing stick for this as well.

13:09.700 --> 13:12.700
This is what happens when you have too much personality.

13:14.700 --> 13:20.700
The reason that I've covered these topics from earlier on in his career are because these are things that could easily be quashed.

13:20.700 --> 13:24.700
If these were the only claims, then his response would be straightforward.

13:24.700 --> 13:29.700
He's a changed man, he realises the errors of his ways, and he won't be doing it again.

13:29.700 --> 13:33.700
And in a way, that did happen, but it was missing some details.

13:33.700 --> 13:35.700
So let's discuss his response.

13:39.700 --> 13:43.700
So the first thing that Oxhorn did was remove the incriminating evidence.

13:43.700 --> 13:49.700
Now, on principle, that is the right thing to do, as keeping them up can be seen as an implicit endorsement,

13:49.700 --> 13:55.700
and when some people started criticising him for it, some fans and their defences of him were mildly concerning.

13:55.700 --> 13:59.700
Why would I be scared of a faggot, boo motherfucker?

13:59.700 --> 14:04.700
If you don't have the same ideology, you wouldn't want it spreading, or providing the impression that you think that way.

14:04.700 --> 14:10.700
However, as I'm sure many of you know, these articles are typically archived by people, so the information is still out there.

14:10.700 --> 14:15.700
However, for his domain, which contained his manifesto, I went to search it up, as you do,

14:15.700 --> 14:20.700
and he actually placed a special request with the web archives to make sure you couldn't archive it,

14:20.700 --> 14:23.700
which is admittedly a bit of a weird move.

14:23.700 --> 14:28.700
I mean, alright, you don't want something out there, but as long as people already have screenshots,

14:28.700 --> 14:35.700
it seems strange that you would try and completely bury its existence, especially when it was just a fraction of the criticism.

14:35.700 --> 14:40.700
It does make you wonder what else was on there, but I digress, we cannot prove anything.

14:40.700 --> 14:46.700
However, with the existence of questions surrounding his mentality, it made sense that he'd finally do a video addressing these claims.

14:46.700 --> 14:52.700
As mentioned, it should have been a fairly simple dispatch of various points against him, and the comprehension that your positions have changed,

14:52.700 --> 14:54.700
and on first glance, the video does that.

14:54.700 --> 14:59.700
When I watched it first, I was pretty much done with the drama, and it seems many commenters would want over too,

14:59.700 --> 15:02.700
but when I returned one more time, things didn't seem quite right.

15:02.700 --> 15:07.700
I mean, he deals with the previous positions on homosexuality fairly reasonably, as mentioned,

15:07.700 --> 15:11.700
although he could have dealt with it sooner, placed an explanation in somewhere,

15:11.700 --> 15:15.700
not doing so doesn't make him a bad person if he considered those views in the past,

15:15.700 --> 15:21.700
and given the very rapid expansion of his YouTube channel, he might just not really want to bring attention to it.

15:21.700 --> 15:24.700
So with that one out the way, suddenly, something clicked.

15:52.700 --> 15:57.700
Some viewers told me that this wasn't very kind, and upon reflection I agreed, and so I deleted the video.

15:57.700 --> 16:04.700
It got only a handful of views before I deleted it, but as is the nature of the internet, nothing ever truly disappears from the internet,

16:04.700 --> 16:08.700
and so trolls have dug up this very old video in an attempt to harm me.

16:08.700 --> 16:12.700
Ok, but that's almost completely false.

16:12.700 --> 16:15.700
There have been claims about the girl's age, but that's not verifiable.

16:15.700 --> 16:20.700
What we do know is that this video was uploaded to YouTube and quickly became one of his most viewed videos at the time,

16:20.700 --> 16:23.700
and was still up on his channel after three days.

16:23.700 --> 16:28.700
This is not ambiguous, this is archived, which makes me wonder if he knew it was archived.

16:28.700 --> 16:33.700
And sure, people confuse details, when you're making comments as if they're solidified responses,

16:33.700 --> 16:37.700
and playing it down as if that's a defence, then you cannot allow for that.

16:37.700 --> 16:44.700
It's also noteworthy that all the details that Oxhorn gets wrong are details that would immediately play down the severity of such incidents,

16:44.700 --> 16:49.700
and honestly, there is an inkling of suspicion in me that he does actually know how the incident went down.

16:49.700 --> 16:53.700
The only thing that completely bewilders me is why on earth would he lie about it?

16:53.700 --> 16:58.700
As far as I can tell, even if what he did has stayed up for a year and got 50,000 views,

16:58.700 --> 17:02.700
an apology would have perfectly quelled any irritation that people felt about the incident.

17:02.700 --> 17:06.700
It seems like a way to frame his mentality as impulsive, rather than what it actually was.

17:06.700 --> 17:10.700
You can regret mentalities, you don't have to bend the truth.

17:10.700 --> 17:14.700
On top of this, prior to the video, when asked about it in his Discord, he said it was a Twitter video.

17:14.700 --> 17:17.700
Is he trolling? This is a bruh moment.

17:18.700 --> 17:23.700
Alright, so that was a bit of a strange explanation, it had my suspicions raised a little, but life goes on.

17:23.700 --> 17:26.700
Can't just throw someone to the dogs for a little misinformation.

17:26.700 --> 17:31.700
He then launches into this attack against the people who have been trying to fabricate the claims against him,

17:31.700 --> 17:33.700
some very malicious actors by the looks of it.

17:48.700 --> 17:51.700
And then tried to spread around as if I had actually said it.

17:51.700 --> 17:56.700
Another guy fabricated a conversation between himself and another big YouTube channel

17:56.700 --> 17:59.700
using the inspect element option of Google Chrome.

17:59.700 --> 18:06.700
He was able to just swap out the HTML to have the other YouTube channel say whatever he wanted that YouTube channel to say.

18:06.700 --> 18:13.700
In this way, he started creating screenshots, spreading lies saying that this YouTube channel was working on a hit piece against me,

18:13.700 --> 18:16.700
and that I had tried to bribe him to not publish that video.

18:16.700 --> 18:22.700
These are all lies, and this particular user was even punished by the other members of his Discord server for lying to them.

18:22.700 --> 18:30.700
But even though they know that it was a lie, this hasn't stopped other YouTubers from creating video content about these lies as if they could be true.

18:30.700 --> 18:32.700
That's just the way many of these trolls are.

18:32.700 --> 18:37.700
They'll use homosexuality and misogyny as weaponized tools to attack another person,

18:37.700 --> 18:43.700
but when they're alone, their everyday conversations are rife with racism, sexism, and homophobia.

18:43.700 --> 18:47.700
These organized attacks have taken a number of forms over the past few months.

18:47.700 --> 18:51.700
The original Discord server where much of this went on collapsed due to internal struggles,

18:51.700 --> 18:55.700
and so they've taken up a bunch of other Discord servers where the exact same thing is going on.

18:55.700 --> 19:00.700
It's an organized campaign to try and spin a story that puts me in a negative light.

19:00.700 --> 19:04.700
He basically suggests this encompasses the sort of toxic mentality against him,

19:04.700 --> 19:11.700
and although I would certainly agree that those people engaging in such behaviour shouldn't be empowered in any sort of way whatsoever,

19:11.700 --> 19:14.700
it's also important to look at the criticism and how it might have arisen.

19:14.700 --> 19:17.700
Oxhorn says he doesn't have any sort of problem with fair criticism.

19:17.700 --> 19:20.700
And people are free to disagree with me about lore.

19:20.700 --> 19:25.700
I'll even hop into the comments section and have vigorous debates with people about specific lore topics.

19:25.700 --> 19:29.700
As long as everyone is respectful and kind to each other, these can turn into wonderful conversations.

19:29.700 --> 19:32.700
And I would say, this has been plaguing a lot of videos I've seen on him.

19:32.700 --> 19:36.700
They're all just loaded with the fact that these people do not like Oxhorn,

19:36.700 --> 19:41.700
and if you, as a YouTuber, believe he's manipulating his audience into thinking you're inherently toxic,

19:41.700 --> 19:44.700
you really want to make sure those videos don't come across that way.

19:44.700 --> 19:50.700
Fans will always go into the innocent until proven guilty mindset, even more strongly than most people,

19:50.700 --> 19:54.700
and therefore, you have to put forward a decent case without going into too many ad hominems,

19:54.700 --> 19:56.700
even if it's something that lights a fire on you.

19:56.700 --> 20:00.700
That's just a side note, and one that I'd try and keep in mind for the future.

20:00.700 --> 20:04.700
With that said, even though I don't think they were presented correctly,

20:04.700 --> 20:10.700
I wouldn't brand all those who have criticized him as, quote, trolls, and we'll continue that lie of discussion in a moment.

20:10.700 --> 20:12.700
Let's continue to watch this.

20:12.700 --> 20:16.700
There was one time, for example, when I was doing a video on the Sunset's Hasperilla headquarters,

20:16.700 --> 20:20.700
where I saw a Brotherhood of Steel decal on a manila envelope,

20:20.700 --> 20:23.700
and I didn't realize at the time that it came from one of my mods.

20:23.700 --> 20:27.700
Instead, I assumed that Obsidian had just reused assets from Fallout 3.

20:27.700 --> 20:31.700
Obsidian did reuse assets from Fallout 3, they reused a ton of assets.

20:31.700 --> 20:36.700
If you go into Michelangelo's sign shop, for example, we find signs from the Capital Wasteland,

20:36.700 --> 20:39.700
that should not be in New Vegas at all.

20:39.700 --> 20:43.700
However, once viewers made me aware that it was a mod, I immediately went into the comment section

20:43.700 --> 20:47.700
and posted a comment correcting my mistake, and I pinned it to the top of the comment section.

20:47.700 --> 20:52.700
Alright, so this is referring to the criticism that he was just looking to hate on Obsidian,

20:52.700 --> 20:57.700
thus shilling for Bethesda, and although he admits he was wrong about the certain detail,

20:57.700 --> 21:00.700
it seems he didn't immediately change it like he said,

21:00.700 --> 21:04.700
although it might look like that, you can see that the pinned comment has been quote edited,

21:04.700 --> 21:08.700
now people edit pinned comments all the time, I do, that's not a big deal,

21:08.700 --> 21:14.700
but that also doesn't mean that the comment was posted immediately before any of these videos at all.

21:14.700 --> 21:17.700
There's a screenshot of him replying, dude wow, just wow,

21:17.700 --> 21:22.700
in a rather condescending tone to someone who brings this up, which once again makes you wonder.

21:22.700 --> 21:26.700
With that said, a majority of his other responses are fairly straightforward,

21:26.700 --> 21:31.700
they're mostly relating to Fallout, and I do think a lot of the allegations he received on that front

21:31.700 --> 21:36.700
were fairly difficult to really do anything about, and therefore not really worth their weight in discussion.

21:36.700 --> 21:39.700
However, he does end the video on a bit of a strange note.

21:39.700 --> 21:45.700
I'm publishing this video because people have asked why they've been seeing a flurry of anti-oxhorn videos

21:45.700 --> 21:49.700
recommended to them on YouTube, and it's because I'm under a coordinated attack

21:49.700 --> 21:52.700
from people who are trying to punish me for playing Fallout 76.

21:52.700 --> 22:05.700
Well don't worry Oxhorn, I don't give a shit about Fallout 76, let's talk about what I do give a shit about.

22:17.700 --> 22:20.700
The thing is, although his response sufficed for many people,

22:20.700 --> 22:25.700
some felt like he had omitted certain details, he does address them in a pinned comment eventually,

22:25.700 --> 22:29.700
but let's discuss the accusations first and then bring it back to that.

22:29.700 --> 22:33.700
People have been making videos on Oxhorn for a while, and on principle that's unsurprising,

22:33.700 --> 22:39.700
if you're a large creator with some hot opinions and dirty laundry, then yes, people are gonna wanna talk about it,

22:39.700 --> 22:42.700
and when I watched some of these videos on him, I wasn't particularly compelled,

22:42.700 --> 22:48.700
like as far as I could tell, they were the sort of small YouTuber content that you will find on anyone.

22:48.700 --> 22:58.700
I doubt your wife would be okay with you using thumbnails like this, or like this, or like this, or even this one.

22:58.700 --> 23:04.700
Oxhorn has stated in his videos to not give in to vices, all while smoking and drinking scotch,

23:04.700 --> 23:16.700
but it is easy to let it slide strictly because most people usually don't consider alcohol or smoking to be a drug.

23:16.700 --> 23:21.700
I mean, it's not the most persuasive stuff, and as a large YouTuber, it is fairly harmless,

23:21.700 --> 23:26.700
which is why it's confusing that Oxhorn has allegedly taken such a hard-line stance against it.

23:26.700 --> 23:32.700
There are multiple creators who have come forward claiming that Oxhorn has placed community and or copyright strikes against their videos,

23:32.700 --> 23:36.700
and on top of that, has been silencing criticism over this in his comment sections.

23:36.700 --> 23:42.700
The first discussed case is the one relating to a YouTuber by the name of Logical Underscore Fallacy,

23:42.700 --> 23:47.700
now named Thomas Beckett. He made a video in response to Oxhorn's video defending Fallout 4.

23:47.700 --> 23:54.700
As an outsider, it was a fairly confusing video with melodramatic rhetoric that didn't quite feel like it had earned its tone.

23:54.700 --> 23:59.700
Maybe Oxhorn could ban me from his channel, but he cannot ban the truth.

23:59.700 --> 24:05.700
And this is a new year, this is the year 2018, and this is the year that we fight back.

24:05.700 --> 24:10.700
This is the year that we take a stand against frauds like Oxhorn.

24:10.700 --> 24:15.700
As said, it's a video by a very small YouTuber that shouldn't really have too much of an impact,

24:15.700 --> 24:21.700
and yet surprisingly enough, he was given a community strike for bullying, which is rather bizarre.

24:21.700 --> 24:27.700
What is even stranger is then that his channel was taken down despite supposedly not having any additional content on the matter,

24:27.700 --> 24:33.700
and with Logical receiving no further information than these emails, which attributed the removal to Oxhorn's complaints.

24:33.700 --> 24:39.700
Now, it seems strange to me, personally, that YouTube would actually disclose the plaintiff, so I sought verification of this.

24:39.700 --> 24:44.700
Now, I did speak to Logical, to see if he still had a copy of the email, which he said he didn't.

24:44.700 --> 24:48.700
But not deterred, I decided to reach out to YouTube, and although they were hesitant at first,

24:48.700 --> 24:52.700
once I told them I had permission from the owner, and it was pretty much all public,

24:52.700 --> 24:56.700
they did confirm it was legit, so it's not looking good for our friend Brandon here.

24:56.700 --> 25:00.700
However, I do say that with the reservation, that in their first response to me,

25:00.700 --> 25:06.700
they say they don't typically name people who report other creators, so maybe the guy responding is confused here, I don't know.

25:06.700 --> 25:09.700
I'll let you make your own conclusions regardless.

25:09.700 --> 25:13.700
One thing that I would say is that, in Oxhorn's response, in his pinned comment,

25:13.700 --> 25:17.700
he showed a general ignorance of the reliability of YouTube's system.

25:17.700 --> 25:22.700
At the end of the day, we're not trying to necessarily make the judgement of whether the report was right or wrong,

25:22.700 --> 25:25.700
we're trying to work out whether this was in good or bad faith.

25:25.700 --> 25:28.700
And then we have to discuss the copyright system.

25:28.700 --> 25:32.700
Now, Oxhorn has made a flurry of copyright claims in the last few years,

25:32.700 --> 25:38.700
most of them on re-uploads of clips, and although I don't necessarily agree with preventing people from being able to see these clips,

25:38.700 --> 25:42.700
see my video on Pokimane for that, he's still within his right to take them down.

25:42.700 --> 25:47.700
However, one situation stood out, this is one with a creator named Sinon Mercer.

25:47.700 --> 25:50.700
Now, he posted two re-uploads of certain clips onto his channel,

25:50.700 --> 25:53.700
Oxhorn decided that he was going to get these videos removed,

25:53.700 --> 25:59.700
but rather than just claiming them like many YouTubers do, he filed straight up DMCA takedowns,

25:59.700 --> 26:01.700
which deals one strike per video.

26:01.700 --> 26:07.700
Now, as said, he is in his right to do this, but it's pretty aggressive, and gives them much less channel mobility,

26:07.700 --> 26:12.700
but maybe he just perceived the uploader as having ill intent against him, and therefore it was warranted.

26:12.700 --> 26:18.700
So, clearly annoyed at receiving two strikes, Sinon then uploads a more regular quote exposed video.

26:18.700 --> 26:21.700
As expected, it's not quite a content cop.

26:21.700 --> 26:27.700
What I find ironic about the whole thing, though, is that a real man would admit and fix his mistakes,

26:27.700 --> 26:33.700
which Oxhorn doesn't do, despite him claiming that he's so manly.

26:33.700 --> 26:37.700
And what Oxhorn does is he goes in for the kill, he files a third takedown notice,

26:37.700 --> 26:40.700
that would have terminated Sinon's account altogether.

26:40.700 --> 26:46.700
Now, fortunately, through some miracle, YouTube actually intervened and stated that it was fair use,

26:46.700 --> 26:49.700
which given how broken the system is, is almost incredible.

26:49.700 --> 26:52.700
And with this, Oxhorn had fucked up, big time in fact.

26:52.700 --> 26:59.700
Out of anything worth quote exposing him over, this is the closest you get to affirmation that he has the ability to be malicious.

26:59.700 --> 27:04.700
Now, Oxhorn did not address this in the video, but he did respond to this in the pinned comment.

27:04.700 --> 27:09.700
After stating that all critical channels on him are still up, which is a strange thing to say on principle,

27:09.700 --> 27:15.700
because you'll only be able to see the channels that are still up, he then speaks about this specific situation relating to Sinon.

27:16.700 --> 27:21.700
He states that the reason he made the stripe was because the video included the use of an animated short

27:21.700 --> 27:27.700
that completely removed any real reason to watch his own video because it used the content in almost all its entirety,

27:27.700 --> 27:34.700
and it was fine anyhow because YouTube saved him, and therefore he didn't necessarily need to look up the legality himself.

27:34.700 --> 27:38.700
So I watched Sinon's video, and surprise surprise, Oxhorn's statement on it is false.

27:38.700 --> 27:44.700
In Sinon's video, the animated clip that he uses is just over a minute out of the video which is 8 minutes long,

27:44.700 --> 27:52.700
and ironically enough, uploaded in its entirety on someone else's channel where it's been for the last 10 years.

27:52.700 --> 27:57.700
And to add insult to this injury, in the complaint that YouTube intervened in,

27:57.700 --> 28:03.700
Oxhorn gave different timestamps which didn't even match where Sinon used the animated short in his video,

28:03.700 --> 28:07.700
the clip he was complaining about was one where he was just talking in front of a camera.

28:07.700 --> 28:12.700
I feel that a defence from Oxhorn is rooted in the point of view that you would have to be pretty petty

28:12.700 --> 28:19.700
to go after this sort of exposed video that used information from other exposed videos and was recorded on a potato.

28:19.700 --> 28:24.700
He clearly watched it all through, he is reaching Keemstar levels of obsessed.

28:24.700 --> 28:30.700
I could barely get through 10 minutes of that video, it seems almost unbelievable, but he clearly did.

28:30.700 --> 28:36.700
His point of view is also mixed with the idea that YouTube's system is just working fine and therefore it's not a big deal.

28:36.700 --> 28:40.700
Nothing bad happened, even though his strike could have led to channel deletion.

28:40.700 --> 28:46.700
The system is completely dysfunctional, and this has been broken for ages, even PewDiePie has been struck,

28:46.700 --> 28:53.700
and YouTube didn't magically detect it, and this has happened again and again, anyone in commentary knows this.

28:53.700 --> 28:58.700
The difference is when larger channels are struck, they can stand up for themselves, smaller channels don't have that,

28:58.700 --> 29:04.700
and someone like Sinon would have never got their channel back, and that whole attempt to strike was reckless at best.

29:04.700 --> 29:08.700
It makes the narrative that he'd do that to another channel much more plausible,

29:08.700 --> 29:13.700
and his retrospective framing of the situation is misleading, more than forgetfulness can explain.

29:13.700 --> 29:15.700
And speaking of misleading,

29:17.700 --> 29:23.700
a lot of videos that have attacked Oxhorn have focused on a lot, which in my opinion is explainable,

29:23.700 --> 29:26.700
even if Oxhorn himself has not explained them the best.

29:26.700 --> 29:32.700
On principle, I don't think that someone should have their career ended for a load of old content that we've discussed today,

29:32.700 --> 29:35.700
even if in hindsight it was done in rather poor taste.

29:35.700 --> 29:43.700
There was a video uploaded called Defending Oxhorn, released by YouTuber Average Betas, who brand themselves as comedians.

29:43.700 --> 29:46.700
Anyhow, in this one video, it is just a single bloke,

29:46.700 --> 29:50.700
and throughout the first half of the video, he makes these sorts of defences that I've referred to,

29:50.700 --> 29:53.700
and although I think they could have been a bit more well researched,

29:53.700 --> 29:58.700
and people were giving him far too much credit for a line that was Jack from the Simpsons, I think.

29:59.700 --> 30:02.700
Nobody's perfect, that's why they put erasers on pencils.

30:02.700 --> 30:06.700
Everybody makes mistakes, that's why they put erasers on pencils.

30:06.700 --> 30:11.700
His points weren't really that incorrect, that is until he gets to copyright,

30:11.700 --> 30:18.700
and a lot of people have been going around citing this as a defence against the attacks that Oxhorn has been receiving,

30:18.700 --> 30:25.700
and I don't think I can quite do justice for how bad I personally believe this next set of argumentation is,

30:25.700 --> 30:31.700
so I think it's time to turn this into a little collab, and who else better served to cover this than my good friend, John Swan.

30:31.700 --> 30:34.700
I suggest we bring him in, take it away my friend.

30:34.700 --> 30:38.700
Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the writer pit- wait that is not the intro.

30:38.700 --> 30:44.700
Hello everyone, Tro has asked me to cover this joke of a video, specifically the points relating to fair use.

30:44.700 --> 30:49.700
I've studied copyright law quite extensively, so it's only fitting that the person who made this video,

30:49.700 --> 30:52.700
Average Betas, starts off this section talking about copyright,

30:52.700 --> 31:00.700
stating that he's not a lawyer, but that he can give a YouTuber's perspectives on the events surrounding Oxhorn and his copyright related incidents,

31:00.700 --> 31:03.700
specifically on matters related to fair use.

31:03.700 --> 31:07.700
Let's watch along and see what he has to say, I'm sure it's incredibly insightful.

31:07.700 --> 31:15.700
However, I can speak from a YouTuber's perspective and give you what I know about striking channels, and what I know about fair use.

31:15.700 --> 31:19.700
If for instance, someone steals my content and tries to pass it off as their own, then I can strike their channel.

31:19.700 --> 31:25.700
If someone takes some of my paid content, like for instance something I put on Patreon, and they show it on their channel for free, I can strike their channel.

31:25.700 --> 31:30.700
If a person takes private content of mine and shows it on their channel, I can strike their channel.

31:30.700 --> 31:34.700
Wait, what? That's completely untrue.

31:34.700 --> 31:37.700
Now, his language is a bit convoluted here.

31:37.700 --> 31:44.700
He uses the word show, and doesn't specify whether this showing involves the content being used in an expose work of some kind,

31:44.700 --> 31:47.700
or whether the content is just re-uploaded.

31:47.700 --> 31:54.700
However, judging from statements further on in the video, I'm going to have to go with the conclusion that he means showing in any capacity whatsoever.

31:54.700 --> 31:57.700
So, let's break this down.

31:57.700 --> 32:06.700
He is very correct when he says that these cases are not necessarily against fair use, because these uses are definitely fair in many contexts.

32:06.700 --> 32:11.700
But he's completely incorrect in stating that these uses are against YouTube's terms of service.

32:11.700 --> 32:17.700
If we read YouTube's terms of service, we see nothing here relating to the topics which he has discussed.

32:17.700 --> 32:22.700
But let's just say he made a mistake, and he meant to say the community guidelines terms.

32:22.700 --> 32:26.700
But wait, nothing in there says anything about these topics either.

32:26.700 --> 32:31.700
In fact, no document published by YouTube says anything about posting content behind a paywall,

32:31.700 --> 32:39.700
or posting content that is not publicly available, aside from their copyright related documents, of which fair use is a valid defense.

32:39.700 --> 32:41.700
Let's keep on watching here.

33:00.700 --> 33:02.700
This is a major problem with these points.

33:02.700 --> 33:10.700
I think average Batters is under the impression that content that is not published isn't protected by the same copyright laws as a published work,

33:10.700 --> 33:13.700
in which case he would be unconditionally wrong.

33:13.700 --> 33:22.700
Unpublished works hold the same copyright status as published works, and therefore are governed by the same fair use clauses as published works.

33:22.700 --> 33:27.700
Furthermore, this has also been proved by multiple court cases on the subject.

33:27.700 --> 33:29.700
He goes off on a similar tangent here.

33:32.700 --> 33:36.700
...would be considered under copyright law, and are protected under fair use.

33:36.700 --> 33:40.700
This means a private video of me at the beach with my family is not fair use.

33:40.700 --> 33:47.700
Nor is any other private footage I don't make publicly available for entertainment consumption and copyright the works.

33:47.700 --> 33:52.700
Just like how a deleted video on Facebook isn't under fair use, as far as I'm aware, I'm not a lawyer.

33:52.700 --> 33:54.700
Yeah mate, we can easily tell that you're not a lawyer.

33:54.700 --> 33:56.700
And again, completely incorrect.

33:56.700 --> 34:00.700
And just shows how much this particular individual knows about fair use.

34:00.700 --> 34:04.700
He didn't even bother to do a quick Google search to verify what he's talking about.

34:04.700 --> 34:08.700
Another misinformed statement that completely manipulates the narrative is this one.

34:08.700 --> 34:15.700
If I were to try to strike a channel that was using my content under fair use, or wasn't doing anything wrong,

34:15.700 --> 34:22.700
and YouTube reviewed the strike and saw I was in the wrong, that I was falsely claiming something against that channel,

34:22.700 --> 34:24.700
I would risk losing my channel.

34:24.700 --> 34:27.700
This is, once again, completely incorrect.

34:27.700 --> 34:33.700
To submit a DMCA strike on YouTube, you have to acknowledge that the strike is being made in good faith.

34:33.700 --> 34:39.700
No one, aside from the individual who submitted the strike, could genuinely verify whether the strike was made in good faith,

34:39.700 --> 34:42.700
especially when it is a grey area.

34:42.700 --> 34:48.700
YouTube can't generally step in when strikes are made, since they have to maintain their Safe Harbor status.

34:48.700 --> 34:55.700
Safe Harbor is a provision in US copyright law that states that services like YouTube are not legally responsible

34:55.700 --> 34:58.700
for the uploading of unlicensed content by their users.

34:58.700 --> 35:03.700
There have been circumstances where it was pretty easily determined that a strike was not made in good faith,

35:03.700 --> 35:09.700
specifically if an account has been deemed as suspicious, however, for the most part, it doesn't occur.

35:09.700 --> 35:13.700
Since it is difficult to tell whether a strike was made in good faith,

35:13.700 --> 35:17.700
the channels that submit the strikes don't usually have consequences levelled against them,

35:17.700 --> 35:22.700
and thus this claim, made by average batters, is a big stretch to say the least.

35:22.700 --> 35:27.700
If someone posted a video about me and how they don't like my videos, then who cares, have at it, go nuts.

35:27.700 --> 35:30.700
I just had at it. It was very entertaining.

35:30.700 --> 35:36.700
Thank you for being a buffoon and gracing us with this discrepant conglomeration of Boulder Dash. Much appreciated.

35:36.700 --> 35:41.700
Thank you so much, Jon. I hope he's cleared up any qualms that can be found in the video.

35:41.700 --> 35:47.700
I'm going to leave his channel in the pinned comment, I'd definitely recommend checking his work out if you enjoy that sort of analysis,

35:47.700 --> 35:50.700
though he needs to upload more, so make sure you go and let him know that.

35:50.700 --> 35:57.700
To average batters, I apologise for Jon's butchering of your name, but you did butcher copyright law, so we'll consider it even.

35:57.700 --> 36:03.700
However, with all this in mind, I want to begin to tie things up, though admittedly it's quite a lot to do.

36:11.700 --> 36:17.700
In his response video, Oxhorn placed his critics into a collective who were all conspiring against him,

36:17.700 --> 36:21.700
and although I would agree that some of these guys clearly have ties to each other,

36:21.700 --> 36:29.700
I think they've more been united by their negative experiences with Oxhorn rather than being united prior to simulating negative experiences,

36:29.700 --> 36:33.700
and maybe originally it was born out of his opinions on Fallout.

36:33.700 --> 36:39.700
When you say something that is unpopular and kinda side him with the corporation, you're gonna get people who think you're shills,

36:39.700 --> 36:43.700
and when watching some of the oldest videos on him, that's certainly how it comes across,

36:43.700 --> 36:49.700
but eventually this manifested when people started to think that he'd overstepped his jurisdiction in responding to these,

36:49.700 --> 36:54.700
and his attempt to finish off Simon Mercer's channel was probably where the cynicism peaked.

36:54.700 --> 37:00.700
He really doesn't like people bringing attention to this stuff, and on principle, I get it, if you have something you're ashamed of,

37:00.700 --> 37:05.700
then you don't want to be continuously dragged over it. Equally, you don't want people to look you up,

37:05.700 --> 37:10.700
and that to be their first impression of you, you want them to be clear, that's not what you believe.

37:10.700 --> 37:14.700
I think that's happened to a majority of creators on this platform, myself included,

37:14.700 --> 37:19.700
but there's nothing you can really do than release a statement and roll with a few punches here and there.

37:19.700 --> 37:26.700
There will be people with perceptions of you that aren't quite current or accurate, just make sure that doesn't become prevalent.

37:26.700 --> 37:32.700
Twisting the truth in subsequent responses will inevitably come back to harm you because people will perceive it as dishonesty,

37:32.700 --> 37:37.700
and trying to cover up these things makes people question if you really understand the gravity or the consequences,

37:37.700 --> 37:40.700
or even feel remorse for them in the first place.

37:40.700 --> 37:45.700
There's been a lot of evidence that Oxhorn is deleting comments on his newest video when people present counter-narratives,

37:45.700 --> 37:49.700
such as the disparity between the YouTube comment count and Social Blade comment count,

37:49.700 --> 37:54.700
as Social Blade updates after, implying that comments were being deleted post-publication,

37:54.700 --> 37:58.700
even ones that seem reasonable, just coincidentally being against him.

37:58.700 --> 38:04.700
Assumedly, a lot of people are being hidden from the channel too, and it seems he really wants to restrict the scope

38:04.700 --> 38:07.700
of what's being said to those who are basically praising him.

38:07.700 --> 38:10.700
And although it's his channel, he can do what he wants,

38:10.700 --> 38:15.700
when you're so desperate to hide something rather than just making sure the public understand all the context,

38:15.700 --> 38:18.700
people wonder what you've got to hide.

38:18.700 --> 38:24.700
On top of this, there was another account that has been defending Oxhorn in comment sections named KK,

38:24.700 --> 38:28.700
which was funnily enough created four days after the Oxhorn channel,

38:28.700 --> 38:33.700
and it's only subscribed to him, with no other activity in the last eight years.

38:33.700 --> 38:37.700
Although it's not impossible someone might have just come over from the Oxhorn Movies channel,

38:37.700 --> 38:41.700
it is probably an alt. Loads of YouTubers set them up under brand accounts

38:41.700 --> 38:45.700
because back in the day, it was an easy way to upvote videos in case they got bombed.

38:45.700 --> 38:50.700
As a side note, can people start referencing in the description or the pinned comment?

38:50.700 --> 38:52.700
Why did you put it on screen? Are you a boomer, mate?

38:52.700 --> 38:56.700
I think Oxhorn, like some other creators I've encountered in the past,

38:56.700 --> 38:59.700
really overestimate the sensitivity of an audience,

38:59.700 --> 39:04.700
and just try and completely shield them from possible transgressions they may have committed.

39:04.700 --> 39:07.700
It started as an attempt to remove some of the incriminating videos,

39:07.700 --> 39:10.700
and it's clearly gone over the line,

39:10.700 --> 39:12.700
and then when the videos became too much to handle,

39:12.700 --> 39:17.700
he made a response video and a response comment where he somewhat addresses the claims,

39:17.700 --> 39:22.700
but similarly downplays some and misrepresents others to preserve the image.

39:22.700 --> 39:26.700
But I really think if he just said what had happened and just apologised,

39:26.700 --> 39:28.700
then this wouldn't have prolonged any further.

39:28.700 --> 39:31.700
Most audiences just want to enjoy the creators,

39:31.700 --> 39:34.700
and be comfortable knowing they're supporting people who aren't terrible.

39:34.700 --> 39:39.700
Most people's bars aren't that high for past political and moral standards,

39:39.700 --> 39:41.700
especially if you're a Fallout YouTuber.

39:41.700 --> 39:46.700
To add to this, I understand why there are a surprisingly high number of people who want me to cover this,

39:46.700 --> 39:49.700
and I don't doubt they've probably reached out to get other creators as well,

39:49.700 --> 39:52.700
but I think that people have been hesitant to pick this up

39:52.700 --> 39:56.700
because a lot of the videos are hard to follow in exactly what they've been trying to say,

39:56.700 --> 40:00.700
and bogged down in these sort of trivial points which tend to suppress the impact.

40:00.700 --> 40:04.700
It's kinda allowed Oxhorn to jump on the narrative that these people are toxic,

40:04.700 --> 40:08.700
and although some people clearly are, they're not without their legitimate criticisms,

40:08.700 --> 40:14.700
and going as far as to end channels over it is quite ridiculous considering the quality of these videos in question.

40:14.700 --> 40:19.700
I have a hunch if he'd never reacted in the first place, we wouldn't be sitting here having this discussion today.

40:19.700 --> 40:25.700
And this isn't to say I think Oxhorn is a fantastic bloke who just needs a bit of good advice.

40:25.700 --> 40:29.700
Some of his old articles could be somewhat reflective of a mentality he might still hold,

40:29.700 --> 40:32.700
they come across as rather narcissistic,

40:32.700 --> 40:36.700
and as someone who personally also deals with a bit too much narcissism from time to time,

40:36.700 --> 40:41.700
I understand that you get the impression that people are completely out for you with bad intent,

40:41.700 --> 40:45.700
and you just wanna wish they would shut up presenting this perspective which just isn't you anymore,

40:45.700 --> 40:48.700
I completely get that, but Striking is not the answer,

40:48.700 --> 40:52.700
you gotta channel that into something better and showing them that you are better than them.

40:52.700 --> 40:55.700
Striking doesn't do that, it does completely the opposite,

40:55.700 --> 41:00.700
and for what has been done, I would apologise and be grateful that you still have your channel,

41:00.700 --> 41:02.700
but hey, that's just what I think.

41:02.700 --> 41:07.700
Maybe it's not easy to have sympathy for people who you perceive as acting with ill intent.

41:07.700 --> 41:12.700
For me though, I would never assume that someone has that intent inside of them just because they're against me.

41:12.700 --> 41:16.700
Have I dealt with people with ill intent? Sure, but it's not worth making that assumption.

41:16.700 --> 41:21.700
I know a lot of people have a real emotional connection to their channel, and to these causes,

41:21.700 --> 41:25.700
and I wouldn't risk depriving them of that just because they said some mean things about me,

41:25.700 --> 41:28.700
which is what it came down to, and I've tried to be nice to Oxhorn today

41:28.700 --> 41:34.700
because I don't want to present a binary choice to people who may enjoy his content and his personality.

41:34.700 --> 41:40.700
Do they either have to agree with the criticisms and thus hate him, or disagree with all of them and love him,

41:40.700 --> 41:46.700
because then people will reverse the formula and derive their positions on the criticisms from how much they like their YouTubers,

41:46.700 --> 41:49.700
and you can never really find any resolution there.

41:49.700 --> 41:53.700
The truth is, when these things are brought up, people are prepared to forgive.

41:53.700 --> 41:58.700
If people are calling you out, most audiences won't just hear that and assume you're evil from now on,

41:58.700 --> 42:00.700
they want to hear your perspective.

42:00.700 --> 42:07.700
This situation has spiralled beyond anyone's comprehension, and I want to address it because there are some real messages to take away from it.

42:07.700 --> 42:14.700
If you're not a non, or other variances, audiences aren't going to crucify you if you're honest and upfront about your mistakes.

42:14.700 --> 42:20.700
Don't try and destroy smaller channels because they make videos on you. Smaller channels aren't going to destroy your career,

42:20.700 --> 42:25.700
they're more just a way to casually keep your ego in check, even if their criticisms aren't the best.

42:25.700 --> 42:29.700
They're normally rooted in some sentiment that you can link back to a point.

42:29.700 --> 42:34.700
If those criticisms aren't legitimate, then you can ignore them, and chances are they won't gain traction.

42:34.700 --> 42:37.700
If they are legitimate, they probably won't gain that much traction either.

42:37.700 --> 42:42.700
Just keep them in mind, address them in a post if you need to, then at least you've established your position.

42:42.700 --> 42:50.700
I don't support cancel culture, but you can't go in the absolute opposite direction and attempt to just wipe out any evidence of these things happening,

42:50.700 --> 42:54.700
because it doesn't change the fact that they happened, and people will still reflect on them.

42:54.700 --> 43:00.700
There is a lot that I haven't spoken about that other channels have, and generally that's because I don't think it adds to the narrative.

43:00.700 --> 43:06.700
People have said and done stuff on the internet, which we will be asked about, sometimes called out for.

43:06.700 --> 43:13.700
What matters is that we don't try and let the paranoia about presenting a squeaky clean image drive us to attempt to silence those voices,

43:13.700 --> 43:16.700
even if we think those voices are wrong or misled.

43:18.700 --> 43:25.700
So yes, we are at the end of the video again, I want to give a big shoutout to the editors who have done a fantastic job as ever,

43:25.700 --> 43:30.700
I'm gonna leave their links in the pinned comment below, definitely go and check them out.

43:30.700 --> 43:34.700
Also, would love to hear your thoughts on this video, on the topic, it's an interesting one for sure,

43:34.700 --> 43:38.700
I'm sure a lot of my viewers do not know about it, but I wanted to have a discussion over it,

43:38.700 --> 43:44.700
because sometimes it's good to bring these things to light, even if it's not too much of a common occurrence on my channel.

43:44.700 --> 43:49.700
I also want to give a big shoutout to my Patreons, thank you again, some of them are on screen right now,

43:49.700 --> 43:59.700
you guys are great, thanks to my $50 Patreon, Sumhala Baloo, and my $200 Patreons, Brandon and Evening Steel,

43:59.700 --> 44:03.700
your generosity is truly appreciated. Thank you guys very much.

44:03.700 --> 44:07.700
I don't have too much else to add today, if you want to find me, you can reach me on Twitter,

44:07.700 --> 44:14.700
at The Right Opinion, Facebook too, Discord as well, I'm fairly accessible, I like to think so at least,

44:14.700 --> 44:19.700
but other than that, I don't really have too much else to say, so I guess I'll just leave it here.

44:19.700 --> 44:22.700
I'm The Right Opinion, and I'll see you in the next one.

44:33.700 --> 44:45.700
Thanks for watching!
