0	18720	Life. It's a thing. That happens. To pretty much everyone in some capacity.
18720	24160	From the day that life begins to the day it ends, it encompasses an experience unique to that individual.
24160	27600	How that individual may interpret their own life is also something unique,
27600	34000	although there are overarching categories that we may relate, such as happiness, sadness, or in my case, boredom.
34000	40880	People's lives beyond one's own, and their own interpretations of it, have become much more intimate to audiences
40880	46560	over the rise of YouTube. We often see what a person may be going through, but we also may see how they react to it,
46560	52400	and how they interpret it themselves. How much of your life ends up on the internet is principally your discretion,
52400	60080	though there are often exceptions. Today's topic, Onision, is someone who's life, on the surface, seems like the pinnacle
60080	64320	of YouTube melodrama, and the eventful nature that surrounds it.
71360	76320	For over ten years, he has projected his life into the public sphere. He has made countless videos and posts
76320	80960	regarding his past, present, and future. He has been the center of numerous controversies,
80960	88960	and the subject of multiple exposes involving his friends, enemies, and so many more people that I cannot even begin to factor in.
88960	95680	When serious drama occurs, the stress and additional repercussions will often drive many off online platforms.
95680	102080	Onision is a clear exception to that rule, in fact, attention just seems to bring him back with even more aggression,
102080	106680	so I didn't want to make this video under the pretense that it wasn't going to play into his hands.
106680	112880	In fact, even Onision wants me to make this video on him, though I'm not sure it will be exactly what he hoped for.
112880	118400	He did contact me stating that if I'm interested, he can offer evidence to exonerate him of certain claims.
118400	122880	However, over the last couple of months, I have already grown an aversion to such private interactions,
122880	127560	I'm not going to be a YouTuber's shield when they have more than enough platforms to defend themselves already.
127560	131720	Anything that someone wants me to present in public, they can present it themselves.
131760	137560	Today's video is going to be a look at as much published, and the attempt to understand what that says about the person in question,
137560	144440	and maybe a few laughs and jokes along the way, but given the volume there is to look at, it's hard to tell exactly where to start.
144440	152040	I guess the best place is a brief history of Onision, but trying to summarise exactly what has happened there is a task much easier said than done.
152040	158280	What we could really use is a historian, for the internet, you know, an internet historian of sorts.
158520	167400	Oh, what's that? He's busy. Doing raid sponsorships. Well, that's fine. I didn't want him anyway. I know someone better.
167400	172560	Hey, hello, thanks for having me on, that's really nice of you. I'm very happy to be here, actually.
172560	179600	I hope everyone's just having a fantastic day. My name is Pinely, I also have a YouTube channel that you should really subscribe to.
179600	186280	And fun fact about me, I'm actually a pretty massive Onision fan. I think he is just the best.
186280	190640	I don't want Mulder to take me to Area 51!
190640	195400	Oh, he's so swell. How could he even not like this fine young man?
195400	201560	You know, I remember how a few years ago I was watching him dancing around and singing in that banana costume,
201560	206000	and at that moment I was thinking to myself, damn, I guess this is it.
206000	210880	This is where comedy has truly reached its peak, and since I'm such a massive fanboy of Greg,
210880	215120	I've actually made sure to keep track of everything this man has ever done since he was born.
215160	217840	So this is what we're gonna talk about today in Pinely's Corner.
217840	221160	Greg's various projects from before he started his YouTube channel.
221160	222680	Ready? Okay.
222680	229720	So back in 2002, when Greg was just a 17-year-old boy, he created this very cool website called Hybrid Eye.
229720	233920	As you can see, the design is really scary... and orange.
233920	236120	Let's read the description, shall we, folks?
236120	243240	Please feel free to browse all of the links. If done so, you will find many intriguing pieces of literature and graphics.
243240	246120	Some areas of Hybrid Eye will have a symbol like...
246120	252360	Oh, basically stating that the words or images could be slightly disturbing to those under the age of 14.
252360	255160	And sadly, some in their 40s.
255160	259720	Greg also decided to call himself Odd on this website, that was his name.
259720	262520	Just so you guys can know that he's really weird.
262520	264600	He's not really your average Joe.
264600	270200	He makes really deep poems about religion, the Stone Age, and some other sensitive stuff.
270200	274920	That website lasted a whole year before eventually collapsing into itself and dying.
274920	279960	He later moved on to making quite a lot of gaming related websites with a friend of his called Jad.
279960	285160	They had one about Metal Gear Solid and a game review website called Gamer's Shadow.
285160	287480	Apparently, there was some drama surrounding that one.
287480	290920	Some evil people were making fun of poor old Greg.
290920	293480	So yeah, he had to ban all of them.
293480	296120	2003 was also a pretty busy year for him.
296120	301880	He made yet another gaming website with his friend called Extreme Gaming Headquarters.
301880	303240	Yeah, you heard that right.
303240	304440	It's extreme.
304440	307640	You can see from the design of it just how extreme it really is.
307640	315640	The Extreme Gaming Headquarters is an online gaming society made up of elite gaming fans and pros.
315640	319560	He also created like a billion different websites for web hosting,
319560	321800	website promotion, and website developing.
321800	324280	But that's kind of boring, so I'm not gonna dwell on that.
324280	330360	More importantly, he made another website to show off all of his literature and poems and whatnot.
330360	332680	It's exactly what's been missing from my life.
332680	335400	First off, again, a sick design.
335400	336920	Looks real futuristic.
336920	338920	And what's really good about this website
338920	341960	is that I was actually able to find some of the pieces that were on it.
341960	344920	So I hope you're ready to hear one of them because here we go.
346120	347560	What is a pointless fight?
348200	350760	Why do senseless conflicts happen?
350760	353240	Who are the ones who fall victim to these battles?
353240	358840	Over the past, humanity has been damaged deeply by pathetic and disgraceful wars
358840	362360	that happened both between politicians and among average peasants.
362360	365640	Today, smaller verbal battles occur all over our schools.
365640	368200	An individual calls another a foul name,
368200	371720	and immediately the victims think they have some sort of honor to defend.
371720	373720	And this resorts to a fight.
373720	375160	I find this very funny.
375160	378840	This is clearly a guy who really wants you to think that he's so, so smart.
378840	381480	When in reality, that's not really too accurate.
381480	382520	Average peasants.
382520	383400	Jesus Christ.
383400	385240	Then we reach 2004.
385240	387400	Greg graduated from high school,
387400	390120	and you can really tell that at this point he was all like,
390120	393000	Oh, well, I'm not going to see any of these people ever again.
393000	393640	You know what?
393640	397240	I might as well just show off my really, really awful opinions,
397240	398520	because why the hell not?
398520	400760	And that's exactly what he did later that year.
400760	405000	So the first website he made in 2004 was definitely not as bad as the second one.
405000	407800	Greg would just talk about some radio show he liked.
407800	409080	I don't really care.
409080	412760	Later on, around a year later, he turned that site into a website all about him.
412760	414440	The Gregory J website.
414440	418920	He also made this one really, really, really stupid website.
418920	422440	I think it also showcases what kind of person we're really dealing with here.
422440	424840	The site was called Rape Prevention Info.
424840	425480	Yikes.
425480	427320	And here's the description of it.
427320	429320	My name is Gregory J. Daniel.
429320	431560	I am a man of dignity and integrity.
431560	436520	And today I look at our society in recognition of what mockery we have become
436520	441240	due to lack of enforcement of rape crimes that occur every moment of every day.
441240	445800	Not too long ago, I was appalled by suggestions that women dressed themselves up as if they were
445800	449400	homeless or mentally handicapped just to avoid an attack.
449400	453400	This is terrible advice, as hostiles do not always choose based on attraction.
453400	455800	They do it off of who looks most vulnerable.
455800	456520	Weakest.
456520	458600	Today, you will learn how to defend yourself.
458600	461480	When you are through, you will find what true freedom is.
461480	465640	Dress how you like, live how you like, and be ready for the worst.
465640	471560	For if you are, no attacker will ever be able to walk away without they themselves being a victim.
471560	475960	I don't know what made him think this is a good call to make this website.
475960	478120	He's just so clearly full of himself.
478120	482920	You can just see that he thought that he's some sort of savior for all women all around the world.
482920	484120	I know, you might say,
484120	487400	Oh, finally, he was just trying to help people out.
487400	489000	Why are you being like this, man?
489000	491720	Well, I don't know if that's really something that could be said.
491720	494280	When some of the advice that he gave is stuff like,
494280	495160	I don't know.
495160	499000	Act like you are possessed by a demon or mentally handicapped.
499000	503400	Oh, and who can forget about have a bowel movement and rub it in his face.
503400	508360	In 2005, he went on to make another website dedicated to documenting his time in the army.
508360	510920	And then a year later, he found himself on YouTube.
510920	513560	And I think I'll let the right opinion continue from here.
513560	515800	Thank you all for having me on this channel.
515800	518440	And hey, make sure to subscribe to Pinely.
518440	521080	It would make me feel really good and happy.
524680	527480	Oh, guys, look, it's the Internet Historian.
527480	527980	Yay!
528680	530440	Uh, thank you, thank you.
530440	531240	Is Tro here?
531240	533080	Uh, no, I don't think so.
533080	533880	Good.
533880	535480	Why are you running a balaclava?
536360	537560	Showman here.
537560	539480	That's right, I'm even on other channels.
539480	541320	Have you heard about Rayman Legends?
541320	544520	It's a new game sweeping the nation like a deadly virus.
544520	547400	And now it's coming for you and your family.
547400	551240	Play clip of large crowd of people talking about Raid.
551240	553080	You haven't heard of Raid Shadow Legends?
553080	556280	Raid Shadow Legends is a free RPG PVP.
556280	557480	Look at those ratings.
557480	558760	People are going wild.
559960	561160	That one didn't look too wild.
561160	562840	Here's a more measured review.
562840	566520	It has over 15 million downloads in the last six months.
566520	570360	That's over three times the population of the Central African Republic.
570360	573880	And six months, that's over three times the average lifespan.
574440	575640	Wow, impressive.
575640	578280	In fact, I'm so impressed, I'm flying there right now.
578280	579800	Please put your phone away, sir.
579800	580680	We are about to take-
580680	581720	Just fuck off, lady.
581720	585880	I'm customizing over 400 champions that I can collect in the game.
585880	587160	Raid Shadow Legends, huh?
587160	589160	Sir, please, the plane is about to crash.
591480	593400	Wow, what a spectacular view.
593400	596680	Almost as spectacular as the 13 unique in-game-
597480	599480	True, how much longer does this ad go for?
599480	600760	Speaking of dungeons,
600760	604520	make sure you participate in the weekly events to win extra prizes.
604520	606200	The prizes are off the charts.
606200	608920	I can barely contain my excitement.
608920	610520	They've even got a new roadmap.
610520	612840	Who needs Google Maps when you have this baby?
612840	613960	You can play with me, too.
613960	615320	Please raid someone.
616840	618840	I'm gonna raid Shadow Legends.
619560	620840	And you should, too.
620840	623320	Click on the link and claim your epic new hero
623320	627240	and 50,000 non-transferable pieces of silver on...
628200	630440	Raid Shades of Light.
630440	634840	I do sincerely hope you all feel enlightened, because I know I sure do.
634840	638120	But this is the last non-dramatic phase that we'll be covering,
638200	641800	because Onision, believe it or not, is quite a dramatic person.
641800	646360	Now, that was a rather neutral, albeit humorous, perspective on Onision's background prior,
646360	648840	and during his ascent on this beautiful platform.
648840	653400	As noted, he was a real veteran of the internet who had a vision of where he wanted to be,
653400	657080	before many people had even realised the potential of online stardom.
657080	661800	But he was much more a person who tended to fire whatever at the wall with the hope it would stick,
661800	664200	and that formula would not deviate with YouTube.
664200	668840	Old YouTube was created off the basis of weird, wacky, and typically quite annoying.
668840	674040	The obsession with LeFunny voice and LeFunny face is what bolstered Onision's career,
674040	678520	but there was something edgier to what he made, though not always.
678520	695480	You see, Onision was more than just a performative persona, like many creators at the time.
695480	699160	If you were going off his main channel, you probably would have the impression that he takes
699160	703480	pride, and maybe even catharsis, in a slightly unstable character.
703480	707880	However, it didn't stop there, Onision had created a more personal side to him.
707880	710920	This would mainly be projected on the Onision Speaks channel,
710920	714600	although it did sometimes spill over to the other sides of the internet.
714600	720120	Imagine if Fred started a channel where he scrapped the funny voice and began discussing abortion.
720120	723880	That was basically what Onision Speaks was to Onision,
723880	728760	but I think this quickly spelled out two things to a large majority of the audiences.
728760	733160	Firstly, that Onision's personal life was going to become a very public matter,
733160	736760	and secondly, my god, Onision likes to talk about himself.
736760	741880	Now, narcissism is a trait found in a fair few creators, and it's not always disruptive,
741880	747000	but with Onision it was a different brand, and many audiences played into that brand,
747000	749720	whether that attention was positive or negative.
749720	753560	One thing that I would say is that the design of the brand Onision Speaks,
753560	758680	initially being an outlet of Onision rather than making it a more personal venture to him,
758680	762840	showed the proximity of the Onision brand to our friend Greg here,
762840	766200	so he probably weren't going to receive the best dose of sanity.
766200	769800	A great example was his early crusade against meat-eaters.
769800	774760	Onision's main channel would put out some wacky video, maybe with an underlying message,
774760	777000	but you wouldn't take it too seriously.
777000	779560	Onision Speaks- If you feel kicking an animal isn't right,
779560	782680	if you think that torturing living creatures is wrong,
782680	785880	and yet you yourself still consume animals,
785880	787480	don't even waste your breath, Moo.
787480	789160	Don't waste our time, Moo.
789160	792440	You're just as bad as the people that slit our throats, Moo.
792440	798120	And Onision would come in and undercut that with a clarification about how this wacky message
798120	801880	was actually very authentic, and you should definitely listen to it.
801880	805080	Onision Speaks- Vegans do what they do out of necessity.
805080	807560	They save animals by doing what they do.
807560	811400	They save themselves by doing what they do.
811400	815960	Meat-eaters do what they do for whatever reason they do.
815960	817720	Slowly killing themselves.
817720	822280	Onision was online, and alongside came a close-up documenting of his life,
822280	827160	and the next decade of relationships and drama that we will have the displeasure of covering
827160	829160	over however long this takes.
829160	833720	In many ways, it'd be convenient to create a linear timeline of Onision's behaviour,
833720	837000	but honestly, I don't think that we'll be able to do that justice,
837000	839640	because that implies a simple rationalisation,
839640	843240	or at least explanation that can be observed in a chronological way.
843240	847960	And let's face it, Onision isn't exactly known for his rational behaviour,
847960	852280	so we're going to be doing a documenting of all of it, all over the board,
852280	855000	and seeing what exactly it tells us.
855000	857960	Let's start small and move on to greater things.
857960	863000	I'd also like to preface the fact that I've split this video into three rather meaty parts,
863000	866040	and apologise for any inconvenience that may cause.
866040	867960	I hope they will all be worth their time.
869400	872840	Onision has been relatively successful given his stint on YouTube,
872840	875240	and success means you're doing something right.
875240	880040	I think for this part, it's best we look at that before delving into the darker side.
880040	883400	Now, I said at the start that Onision clearly enjoys attention,
883400	888440	and I do believe, to an extent, that motivation is the real bedrock of his content.
888440	891240	Now, so what? A lot of people enjoy attention,
891240	894120	and even if the subject matters were a bit socially loaded,
894120	898920	you could take a lot of his earlier content as somewhat removed from the constraints of discourse,
898920	900920	even if they were bizarre as hell.
900920	903800	Nonetheless, the desire for attention manifests itself,
903800	907240	particularly when you, as a creator, have very little to offer.
907240	911800	And let's be honest here, Onision isn't the most inherently talented person,
911800	914760	he couldn't really sing, he couldn't really act,
914760	918840	he didn't really have any exceptionally insightful social commentary,
918840	921160	all he knew was about attention,
921160	925240	and as people's bar for comedy and other creative content was rising,
925240	927080	Onision wasn't changing.
927080	930600	In spite of this, there is a key to maintaining internet relevance,
930600	933320	and that's creating a relationship with your audience.
933320	935800	Relationships can be created over different mediums,
935800	940600	but for many creators, that relationship can be as simple as sharing experiences.
940600	943400	Sometimes a creator will make more personal videos to do that,
943400	945640	sometimes that means breaking character.
945640	949560	With Onision, openness became a gimmick, there was nothing off limits.
949560	951880	When many creators open up, we will see it as brave,
951880	954200	as it's often a risking element to their persona.
954200	959400	With Onision Speaks, every time he spoke about something, it tackled sensitive topics,
959400	961720	and even if the views themselves weren't the greatest,
961720	964200	he was developing something of a cult persona.
964200	967640	It also allowed him to tackle more serious topics with a degree of clout.
967640	970440	He would upload videos on an incredibly regular basis,
970440	974600	and it provided a medium to create a closer relationship with Daddy over here.
974600	978040	I don't really know where I stand on a few issues,
978040	984440	if I am the villain or the hero, if I am good or pure evil myself.
985240	988920	If by doing everything the right way, the way that I thought was best,
988920	990680	was really even the right way at all.
991560	996200	Because it seems that by doing the things that I feel makes this world better,
996200	999320	or doing the things that I feel make me a good person,
1000040	1007560	I am in fact contradicting everyone else, and I wonder if wrong is right and I am wrong.
1007560	1010120	You have to remember that we're in 2010,
1010120	1013960	a time when many of the largest creators wouldn't be considered celebrities,
1013960	1016920	so many of them would have a decent interaction with their audience.
1016920	1021000	Onision at that point was in the top 100 most subscribed creators,
1021000	1022200	as strange as that is,
1022200	1025480	so having a channel which allowed people to become closer with him
1025480	1028360	was a strong foundation for a more dedicated fanbase,
1028360	1030520	and the fact that he had that level of attention at all
1030520	1032840	would mean that there would always be a certain amount of people
1032840	1035640	who idolized him for that popularity alone.
1035640	1039800	However, not necessarily satisfied with the simplicity of a regular fanbase,
1039800	1044440	Onision always had a slightly different approach to developing his fanbase beyond.
1044440	1046520	You cannot choose who supports you,
1046520	1051240	however, your actions and behavior can definitely shape your audience to a reasonable degree,
1051240	1054440	particularly if you know how to exclude a demographic.
1054440	1059080	This can be done, for example, by taking advantage of polarizing insensitive topics.
1059080	1063240	Now, it's hard to say I know too many people who actively shape their audience,
1063240	1067480	it's something hard to do if you're just trying to make content for yourself,
1067480	1070600	but I am of the belief that Onision definitely did.
1070600	1074200	I'll explain more soon, but first I want to focus on his techniques.
1074200	1078840	And what this all clearly comes down to is if you are pro-circumcision,
1078840	1081720	then you are helping the rapist.
1081720	1084040	You cannot feel with something that does not exist,
1084040	1086120	and when you promote the removal of the foreskin,
1086120	1088360	not only are you making the penis less sensitive,
1088360	1090760	but you are also desensitizing it to pain.
1090760	1094440	A pain that is intended to naturally occur in the uncircumcised penis of a man
1094440	1098280	who is attempting to destroy a woman both physically and psychologically.
1098280	1100600	One thing that Onision knew was how to provoke.
1100600	1103000	He was never one to be afraid of confrontation,
1103000	1106840	and confrontation is sometimes a good way to really build an audience.
1106840	1109480	If you pick a point of view or a strong opinion,
1109480	1113720	you will find an audience who will respect your outspoken and confident demeanor,
1113720	1116920	even if you have no actual clue what you're speaking about.
1116920	1121000	Onision was not qualified in any of the topics that he spoke about to my knowledge,
1121000	1123320	but he tackled them nonetheless.
1123320	1127160	Obviously, this sort of drama was documented with his meat-eater's content.
1127160	1130200	However, over the years, he would regularly have public fallings out,
1130200	1132120	with whoever he could manage.
1132120	1136840	Sorry, I'm just starting to get really sick of hearing about this asshole starting a new drama,
1136840	1138120	and he can sit back and say,
1138120	1141960	oh, he's learned his lesson and it's so hard having these opinions,
1141960	1146680	and we all know in another three months when his views start to plateau again,
1146680	1148520	that he's gonna start some new shit.
1148520	1151320	From 2010, when he had a feud with Shay Carl,
1151320	1153880	over Shay's decision to circumcise his son,
1153880	1156440	to 2016, when he had a feud with Cyr,
1156440	1159720	because he voted for a third-party candidate in California.
1159720	1162120	These are the sorts of ideologically loaded topics
1162120	1165240	that would obviously attract fans and critics alike.
1165240	1168360	He would regularly express controversial opinions on rape,
1168360	1172920	self-harm, suicide, and multiple other issues that would really rile people up.
1172920	1175320	He would also regularly go after multiple creators
1175320	1178600	whose content and audience may even overlap into his,
1178600	1180440	such as his feud with Shane Dawson,
1180440	1183080	a person who he collaborated with, was friends with,
1183080	1185000	and even shared a romantic kiss with.
1186360	1187400	Yet, in spite of this,
1187400	1189560	him and Shane had a significant amount of drama,
1189560	1193560	particularly relating to how Onision felt Shane had treated him as a friend,
1193560	1196120	which there may be some legitimate annoyance in.
1196120	1199640	However, since then, Onision just made multiple videos on Shane Dawson,
1199640	1201240	mostly attempting to call him out,
1201240	1205800	but often just trying to work out a way to bring problems back to how Shane had treated him.
1205800	1206600	Shane Dawson.
1206600	1209080	Oh God, Onision's making another video about him.
1209080	1211080	But talking about him has a lot of advantages.
1211080	1212920	Number one, his name attracts video views.
1212920	1215240	Number two, on a regular basis, people imply that I look like him,
1215240	1217640	which gives me this immortal, annoying association.
1217640	1219240	Number three, I really don't like him,
1219240	1221240	and ranting about him is therapeutic for me.
1221240	1224760	The one time that Onision did try and make a more serious call-out video
1224760	1227800	is in the form of this 50 millet pseudo-documentary,
1227800	1230840	in which he states that he believes Shane Dawson is a pedophile.
1230840	1233320	Actually, no, that would be unfair.
1233320	1236120	He doesn't say for certain he's a pedophile,
1236120	1239560	he just goes through talking about how Shane Dawson fulfills
1239560	1242760	a large majority of the prerequisites to being a child predator.
1242760	1247160	Wait, Shane Dawson just said that he doesn't tell those jokes anymore.
1247160	1249800	So lying is obviously the number one tactic of predators,
1249800	1251080	as you can see at the top right here.
1251080	1253640	Not telling the whole story, that's what Shane did
1253640	1257400	by not addressing every single clip that he says was taken out of context,
1257400	1260840	but instead he only addressed one where he proved that it was taken out of context.
1260840	1265320	He was jumping all over the place with mood swings by screaming and cussing
1265320	1267800	and then being all normal and then getting kind of emotional.
1267800	1270440	The punishment again is the yelling and the cussing.
1270440	1271960	The denial is very clear.
1271960	1275800	Finning the truth, trying to devalue everything that's said about him
1275800	1279000	by saying it's all just jokes and that he was saying messed up jokes,
1279000	1281800	but never really again telling the whole story
1281800	1284760	like him trying to justify people being a pedo.
1284760	1287800	Where in one podcast he said that he didn't view it as very different
1287800	1289480	from people who have foot fetishes.
1289480	1292680	Or the clip that I played you where he states that he doesn't understand
1292680	1295480	why people get arrested for looking at children who are not clothed.
1295480	1296840	And again, that's minimalizing.
1296840	1298680	And then of course he went to play the victim.
1298680	1302680	You could say he targeted the victim, i.e. people calling him out,
1302680	1305240	but the real victims are to be determined,
1305240	1310680	because so far all he said is that he googled actual children in that situation.
1310680	1313000	So I guess it would be all the children that he googled
1313000	1314840	and describe the results that he saw.
1314840	1317960	These were claims he reiterated for a significant amount of time,
1317960	1320760	and although he did apologize approximately five months ago,
1320760	1324360	it is undisputed that this feud likely alienated audiences
1324360	1326840	who may have found Onision through Shane's content,
1326840	1329560	something that Onision does acknowledge himself.
1329560	1333560	Now, to be frank, I think the treatment of Shane by Onision has been rather poor,
1333560	1337320	given the number of videos made, the tone of these videos, and the message.
1337320	1339960	However, you could at least make the rational argument that
1339960	1342840	Onision was bitter and upset about a friendship.
1342840	1346520	What would happen if we went one step further and visited a situation
1346520	1350840	where there was no way of stating any coherent explanation together,
1350840	1354040	and yet as of right now, it is probably one of the key examples
1354040	1355720	to the next point in my video.
1355720	1357560	But maybe to illuminate this situation,
1357560	1360920	we should spin the wheel and see which commentator can help me out.
1363640	1364680	Take it away, my G.
1366040	1368200	Well, mom, I finally made it.
1369240	1370360	I'm on the right opinion.
1372440	1373880	But I'm talking about Onision.
1377880	1382120	I'm currently a bit under the weather, but never as sick as my buddy Greg,
1382120	1386520	the man who obsessively harassed, mocked, and exploited a fellow YouTuber
1386520	1389080	with an eating disorder for nearly three years.
1389080	1391480	I'm of course referring to Eugenia Cooney.
1391480	1395560	If anybody was in the dark about Eugenia Cooney and her controversial time on YouTube,
1395560	1398040	Shane Dawson swooped in and filled everybody in.
1398040	1402280	But if you're still out of the loop, Eugenia Cooney was your average 2013 YouTuber,
1402280	1407080	just a happy young girl doing Q&As, participating in tags, and showing off outfits.
1407080	1410840	Fast forward three years where a man named Greg would make a video on her,
1410840	1413000	and unfortunately, change her life.
1413000	1416280	And just so you're aware, the majority of these videos are AWOL in the shadow realm,
1416280	1418040	because deleting evidence is always fun.
1418040	1419800	But thankfully, they've all been documented.
1419800	1423960	Believe it or not, but the first video that Onision made on Eugenia Cooney on May 9th,
1423960	1426200	2016 was actually defending her.
1426200	1429960	I mean, with a title like Eugenia Cooney is anorexic, you wouldn't think so,
1429960	1434440	but Onision simply compared her body to a supermodel's, claiming they weren't that different.
1434440	1438120	Four months later, Onision's opinion quickly changed with the titled video,
1438840	1439800	Eugenia Cooney.
1439800	1444200	And a whopping 10 Eugenia videos would follow in the next two months.
1444200	1450120	Onision was clearly worried about paying rent or something because it became very apparent
1450120	1454040	that Eugenia was more so a cash cow to Onision than a charity case.
1454040	1457240	A supposed cry for help became a target on Eugenia's back.
1457240	1462280	Onision would urge his viewers to unsubscribe to Eugenia if she did not gain weight in a
1462280	1466520	certain amount of time, claiming that if you continued supporting her, you would be helping
1466520	1467080	her die.
1467080	1470360	Now, thankfully, Onision announced in early October of that year that
1470360	1474280	he had no plans about making any more Eugenia videos in the future.
1474280	1475000	But tweets?
1475000	1475880	That's fair game.
1475880	1476840	At Onision,
1476840	1480120	Give her a more I care about you but I'm not humiliating you approach.
1480120	1483080	Tried that, but Eugenia, the obvious sociopath
1483080	1487080	Onision accused people of being a sociopath before it was cool
1487080	1490200	continues to inspire young girls to starve themselves regardless.
1490200	1493080	At Onision, you think humiliating her is the way to fix it?
1493080	1495400	If someone is without any doubt killing themselves,
1495400	1498280	bringing attention to their condition is the least you could do.
1498280	1499880	Anorexia is lethal.
1499880	1502040	Greg has a funny way of responding to people.
1502040	1504520	Yeah, I'll take a voting the question for 500 Alex.
1504520	1507480	Shortly after a petition was made to get Eugenia off YouTube,
1507480	1512040	Onision just couldn't help himself and off the wagon he went.
1512040	1513560	This would quickly become a trend.
1513560	1516680	Onision would say he's resigning on the topic of Eugenia,
1516680	1520040	but then proceed to talk about Eugenia because
1520040	1523560	Last time I checked, when you resign from something, you can take it up again if you choose.
1523560	1524680	Why even say that Greg?
1524680	1525480	The hell's the point?
1525480	1528520	Just say the possibility is always there or don't cap it off.
1528520	1529800	Just just leave it.
1530680	1534280	Regardless of what somebody is saying, you should always look at their intent.
1534280	1535400	Why are they doing this?
1535400	1538840	Onision could push his anti-anorexia campaign all he wanted,
1538840	1541080	but as long as he kept uploading videos like this
1541960	1553640	His intent was clear.
1553640	1554840	Now sure, some could say,
1554840	1558920	well his method of saving Eugenia is abrasive, but it could prove effective.
1558920	1559960	I wouldn't be so sure.
1559960	1562280	This is essentially the equivalent of fat-shaming,
1562280	1565640	which according to a professor of health psychology at the University of Sarain,
1565640	1570200	a 2019 article from BBC, shaming is the wrong way to move forward.
1570200	1574200	Even in the example of somebody claiming fat-shaming led to them losing weight,
1574200	1577880	Professor Jane Ogden says that experience is atypical.
1577880	1582520	At this point, Greg's videos were garnering hundreds of thousands, if not millions of views.
1582520	1585640	So it wasn't a surprise when the milkman kept chugging away.
1587320	1589400	I have nipples, Greg. Could you milk me?
1589400	1591480	I don't even think he was hiding it at one point.
1591480	1593240	In one of his videos, he was quoted saying
1593240	1596360	Hey there, I haven't made a video on Eugenia Cooney's weight in months.
1596360	1598520	My videos on Eugenia Cooney always do very well.
1598520	1600440	So as a person who's concerned about Eugenia's health,
1600440	1602360	and a person who wants to make successful videos,
1602360	1604680	I'd like to take the opportunity to publicly check up on her now.
1604680	1605880	Really? What's wrong, Greg?
1605880	1607720	Onision Judge is not hitting like it used to?
1607720	1610040	Probably the most pivotal piece of evidence is when
1610040	1613640	YouTube mass demonetized videos about Eugenia Cooney,
1613640	1618520	and then Onision re-uploaded a video to another channel of his titled
1618520	1621080	Please Help This YouTuber Heal.
1621080	1622120	Not doing this for money.
1622120	1624360	Many more Eugenia re-uploads later.
1624360	1627400	She announces on Twitter that she is taking a break from social media
1627400	1629320	and privately working with a doctor.
1629320	1631160	Please respect that.
1632840	1634200	You guys saved Eugenia.
1634200	1635880	I may know who saved Eugenia.
1635880	1636680	It wasn't me.
1636680	1639240	How Eugenia Cooney will look after recovery.
1639240	1640840	Those are some things I need to say.
1640840	1643240	If you have anything positive you would like to say to Eugenia Cooney,
1643240	1646360	please post it to the page where she can go to see nothing but supportive
1646360	1647560	slash loving statements.
1647560	1649080	Thanks to you and the awesome mods.
1649080	1651560	I'm happy we're making a safe place for her and others.
1651560	1654280	Yeah guys, please go tell Eugenia that you support her
1655000	1657880	on my website's forums that have banner ads.
1657880	1658600	It's to help her.
1658600	1659160	Trust me.
1659160	1660840	As usual, the rumors are not true.
1660840	1663320	I am not making videos on Eugenia Cooney for money.
1663320	1665720	This is an important topic that needs to be discussed.
1665720	1668520	I have a Patreon to help me when my videos do not get monetized.
1668520	1669720	I truly do care about her.
1669720	1671320	As usual, I come with proof.
1671320	1677320	His proof is a screenshot of only four videos out of this 60 he made
1677320	1679000	that were dinged for demonetization.
1679000	1680840	Here's seven reasons why this tweet is horrible.
1680840	1684040	The number one thing you need to give an eating disorder is attention.
1684040	1686440	Not making videos on Eugenia for money
1686440	1690600	and not making money on Eugenia videos are two very different things, Greg.
1690600	1692520	I've made a lot of videos about Eugenia Cooney.
1692520	1694760	It seems you requested a review for one of your videos,
1694760	1697880	and the only reason you would do that is in the attempt to monetize it.
1697880	1699480	You just outed me yourself.
1699480	1702040	It's very possible after you tweet this,
1702040	1706040	you put in a review for the rest of the videos and maybe get them all monetized.
1706040	1707400	Your argument is decimated.
1707400	1710440	I have a Patreon to help me when my videos do not get monetized.
1710440	1712280	Did you guys know I have a Patreon?
1712280	1713960	Well, I mean, not anymore.
1713960	1715480	Do I want your attention?
1715480	1716760	Why even bring up Patreon?
1716760	1718200	That hurts your claim, if anything.
1718200	1719960	Guys, I'm not making these videos for money.
1721320	1723000	I get my money from Patreon, so it doesn't matter.
1723000	1726280	Being stupid means you lack intelligence or common sense.
1726280	1730280	I might be mistaken on this one, but you should have a more recent video up
1730280	1732760	that's not in this screenshot for some reason.
1732760	1735000	You just put it out there even more.
1735000	1738760	Just a week after this tweet, Onision listed 21 of his Eugenia videos
1738760	1740920	because he didn't want his more negative videos.
1740920	1744360	Still hanging over Eugenia's head as she dealt with her disorder privately.
1744360	1747080	At least that's what I would have said if Greg wasn't a scummy hypocrite.
1747080	1750600	He placed those 21 videos behind a paywall on his Patreon.
1750600	1751880	Not doing this for the money.
1751880	1753400	It's extremely gross at this point.
1753400	1758760	Greg is literally taunting her with these re-uploads and these money-grubbing shenanigans.
1758760	1759400	Don't worry, guys.
1759400	1763240	He took them off his Patreon a month later after he already took everybody's money.
1763240	1766040	After everybody went in there, took the videos and downloaded them.
1766040	1766920	And he knows that.
1766920	1768600	He knows that wasn't going to last long.
1768600	1769960	He wanted the quick buck.
1769960	1774200	This saga ends with videos like Eugenia Cooney's beautiful emails to me,
1774200	1775800	where he basically emailed her saying,
1775800	1777080	I wish the best for you.
1777080	1778760	Sorry about those jokes in the past.
1778760	1780280	All 600 of them.
1780280	1784920	Sorry about accusing you of quite literally murdering kids because of your disorder.
1784920	1785960	Dick move on my part.
1785960	1789640	And Eugenia, being the nicest person alive, replies saying,
1789640	1793400	Yeah, you should have really approached all of that differently, but thank you.
1793400	1795480	And Greg cashes in two videos off of that.
1795480	1797400	Did you just want more content, Greg?
1797400	1799080	Or do you actually care now?
1799080	1799880	We may never know.
1799880	1805320	But what we do know is that the majority of Onision's Eugenia vids were made pre-adpocalypse.
1805320	1811080	So he has made, I would assume, tens of thousands of dollars off of her situation.
1811080	1814760	That is excluding the subscriber jumps that he most likely received from those videos,
1814760	1816840	which then trickled views into his other videos,
1816840	1819960	trickling money into his Patreon, trickling money into his merch.
1819960	1823800	If Onision making 60 plus videos on Eugenia Cooney was not for money,
1823800	1827480	then I guess the down payment on a mansion was just an unfortunate byproduct.
1827480	1830760	Those videos that were made intended to help Eugenia Cooney
1830760	1833000	get to rehab and start to rehabilitate.
1833000	1837640	Eugenia Cooney has since gone to rehabilitation and is rehabilitating.
1837640	1843240	Correlation does not imply causation, but whatever helps you sleep at night, Greg.
1843240	1844840	Thank you, Mr. GG.
1844840	1845480	What a G.
1845480	1858680	So here we have a man who picks fights with half the YouTube community.
1858680	1862600	Some of the most popular creators, including many of his former friends are Onision,
1862600	1865080	not Mr. GG though, he might do too.
1865080	1870440	Onision is provocative, offensive, unpleasant, and all around completely contradictory.
1870440	1874520	You'd have a hard time pinpointing where his principles and beliefs often lie,
1874520	1877240	owing the most loyal of fans would support him.
1877240	1880440	But maybe that's the point, and I will elaborate.
1880440	1886600	Many moons ago, I found myself for the first and only time stumbling across an Onision Speaks video.
1886600	1890920	I can't really remember too much about it, but it was regarding some social rights,
1890920	1893240	and on the whole, I remember agreeing with it.
1893240	1896120	It seemed like a sincere appeal to humanity.
1896120	1900360	Now, I didn't know much about him back then, but there are sprinkles of videos,
1900360	1904440	given the volume of them, that will typically appeal to an audience.
1904440	1907480	Onision embedded himself with certain behavioral characteristics
1907480	1909960	which were tailored towards people who may be vulnerable.
1909960	1913880	I'd identify four techniques that were very specific to what he created.
1913880	1916600	Firstly, his nature speak directly to the view often.
1916600	1918840	It allowed him to craft narratives that felt personal.
1918840	1921640	It felt like he was speaking to you a lot of the time.
1921640	1923240	That can be really endearing.
1924120	1925480	You can still walk.
1925480	1926760	You can still move your arms.
1926760	1927720	You can still talk.
1927720	1929240	You're very capable.
1929240	1930520	You're emotionally damaged.
1930520	1931000	So what?
1931000	1931720	I am too.
1932280	1934040	But that doesn't mean we just end it.
1934040	1935400	That doesn't mean we just quit.
1936760	1937880	There's hope for you.
1937880	1941480	This allowed him to create a more personal connection with the viewers he resonated with,
1941480	1944440	especially in environments where people may not have felt cared about.
1944440	1947480	Just having someone talking to you like that can really make a difference.
1948040	1951960	Secondly, his nature used a lot of language that one might class as compassionate,
1951960	1954040	with a framing that may feel more rational.
1954040	1958120	It appeals to people's emotions while giving them a security in the reasoning that he presents.
1958120	1960120	I'm not saying this is a bad way of arguing.
1960120	1962920	We can appeal to principles of morality a lot of the time through this,
1962920	1965960	but it will definitely attract a certain type of audience.
1965960	1969880	Because the relationship situation you find yourself in later on in life
1969880	1973480	does not necessarily define your fucking sexuality,
1973480	1977800	as sexuality doesn't necessarily have a whole lot to do with appearances.
1977800	1980520	You're acting like just because I don't own a fucking castle,
1980520	1982600	I'm not interested in owning a castle.
1982600	1985880	Just because somebody isn't with a beautiful man or a beautiful woman
1985880	1989480	doesn't mean they don't want to be with one or the other or both at the same time.
1989480	1991400	Thirdly, he would appeal to an authority.
1991400	1992440	Which authority?
1992440	1994920	Well, himself, his experiences, his life.
1994920	1997080	This would embolden him in the audience's mind.
1997080	1999720	Now, we all appeal to our experiences from time to time,
1999720	2003960	but he often did it in a very personal, revealing way, and he did it very often.
2003960	2007560	The best I can tell you is to use your best judgment.
2007560	2011960	When I deal with people who have cheat, I tend to disassociate myself with them
2011960	2017800	because they don't really have any reason to have done it beyond their own perversions.
2017800	2019960	So please decide for yourself what is best.
2022200	2024440	And don't do what I've done in the past,
2024440	2027080	where you forgive them for cheating.
2027960	2030440	Finally, he wasn't perfect, but he knew it,
2030440	2032760	and he knew his audience wasn't perfect either.
2032760	2035160	He'd appeal to the beauty in the imperfection,
2035160	2037240	being the outcast, the other people.
2037240	2038680	He was your voice.
2038680	2041960	Are the values of others so important that whenever you look in the mirror,
2041960	2043720	all you see is what they tell you you are?
2043720	2046280	Is the person you wish to be truly someone else?
2046280	2050200	You want to decide your actions based on what you think others will think of you?
2050200	2052600	Or would you rather live your life the way that you want to?
2052600	2054440	When you discover who you truly are,
2054440	2057160	when you finally decide to take on your dream,
2057160	2060600	to live by what harms no one, what feels right to you,
2060600	2064520	the ridicule and mockery you get from others becomes irrelevant.
2064520	2068520	Once you have found who you are, once you discover the truth within yourself,
2068520	2071560	no lies or corrupt persuasion can change who you are.
2071560	2073880	They can't change who you wish to be.
2073880	2078040	He could be confrontational, but he also could be sincere, soft, well-spoken.
2078120	2079400	But his messages were clear.
2079400	2080920	He wanted you to be stronger.
2080920	2081640	He'd been there.
2081640	2085080	He had been to the darkest places in the world and came out on top.
2085080	2087160	His imperfections were your imperfections.
2087160	2090920	He was as tortured as you, but you didn't have to let that hold you back.
2090920	2094680	An idol is meant to be someone we can aspire to, but also someone we relate to,
2094680	2099320	and Onision was crafting himself as the idol to the vulnerable, broken youth.
2099320	2103560	He'd have all these opinions, but then he'd have this deep fleshed out backstory.
2103560	2106600	He was this walking character study slash sitcom
2106600	2111320	who would derive a lot of his opinions from his very serious experiences.
2111320	2115160	But because of all his contradictory, destructive, hurtful behaviour,
2115160	2119000	you'd have to lack some capacity and critical thinking to give him a pass,
2119000	2120440	and yet some people did.
2120440	2123480	In fact, in spite of this, he had a lot of devoted super fans,
2123480	2125480	which is probably what he wanted.
2125480	2129720	One of the tones that he has conveyed is a consistent distrust in authority,
2129720	2131800	even those who might be qualified.
2131800	2135800	And let me let you in on a secret, or at least a personal observation that I'm making.
2135880	2137720	He wants to be the authority.
2137720	2141560	Before Onision's YouTube venture, hopefully mentioned by a good friend earlier,
2141560	2143400	he ran a site called Sesesca.
2143400	2147560	I think this represents eventually what Onision wanted his channel to be.
2147560	2151080	Sesesca was a religion that Greg started when he was 17,
2151080	2154920	although he stated he had subscribed to the doctrine since he was 11.
2154920	2156520	I personally find that unlikely,
2156520	2161480	but hey ho, I think deciding the truth on such a statement would be a bit of a tangent.
2161560	2165080	Sesesca as a concept had all these bizarre ideas
2165080	2168280	that one might expect from a new start-up religion.
2168280	2171480	Onision would regularly spend time in forums promoting the religion,
2171480	2175400	sometimes acting as a follower, sometimes acting as a founder,
2175400	2177160	maybe he was testing a response,
2177160	2180680	or maybe he was just doing what he felt was the most socially beneficial.
2180680	2185000	He also posted some emails he thought were of value from the site,
2185000	2188440	including ones where he credits his sociopathic traits
2188440	2191400	as giving him some form of god-like qualities.
2191400	2192760	How very inspiring.
2192760	2195880	There are many other highlights, but you can see it for yourself.
2195880	2197800	In a way, it makes him a monster.
2198440	2201080	In a way, it makes him a god.
2202360	2204120	Now we may laugh at things like this,
2204120	2205880	but the truth is that all over the world,
2205880	2210680	cults like this are formed under the belief that the person at the helm is some sort of god.
2210680	2211960	Onision knew that,
2211960	2216200	and therefore tried to replicate the formula to create a cyber cult of sorts.
2216200	2219960	Abuse of power within cults is often solicited when a person is roped in
2219960	2225240	by an individual's charisma or sincerity or extensive wealth or any other values like that,
2225240	2229240	but once they're in and once they have become indoctrinated with this belief system,
2229240	2234200	they become often dependent on the cult leader, often financially and emotionally.
2234200	2237080	This allows people in power to exploit that control.
2237080	2239480	Creating a cult online has a few downsides,
2239480	2242040	one of the biggest issues is physical proximity.
2242040	2247000	When you're trying to escape a cult, it's not just mental entrapment, but physical.
2247000	2251400	Even if it's not exactly a prison, the feeling that you may be chased or face a consequence,
2251400	2254360	even worse if you get caught, is scary.
2254360	2258040	If a cult leader has shown themselves to be capable of exploitation,
2258040	2260680	who knows what lengths they'll go to maintain that.
2260680	2263800	Obviously, although someone is not powerless over the internet,
2263800	2267720	the window between people often gives them more control to make decisions
2267720	2271160	that may help them distance themselves from controlling individuals.
2271160	2276280	On top of this, it's hard to channel assets like charisma and sincerity into text form,
2276280	2280520	so it made sense that actually Onision's YouTube channel worked better as a medium.
2281160	2283000	To all you pro-lifers, I have a question.
2285960	2290920	How many times do you need to be raped and impregnated before you figure out
2292920	2294040	that having a choice
2297000	2299880	may be a little bit more important than you originally thought?
2299880	2301800	When you originally look on his channel,
2301800	2304520	maybe you're met with one of the less atrocious takes,
2304520	2307480	maybe you're met with something you feel passionately about,
2307480	2311800	maybe you're in need of help and you're looking for a philosophy to latch onto.
2311800	2316840	Onision isn't incredible, but he can communicate those feelings to a competent degree,
2316840	2319640	and every now and then he'll say something that will resonate.
2319640	2323480	Onision would talk about his personal life, his background, his time in the army,
2323480	2326520	the time he almost took his own life, it's all very personal.
2326520	2330040	He would talk about these experiences as if they weathered him in a way,
2330040	2332040	and gave him some found wisdom.
2333000	2337400	In my mind, the moment that gun was to my head, I stopped being afraid.
2339000	2340440	I stopped caring.
2340440	2342680	I've changed as a person since that day.
2347000	2350760	Because now I feel like no matter what happens to me,
2353880	2356760	I made it way further than I should have.
2356760	2360920	The thing is, although I said there was no discernible explanation for his behavior,
2360920	2364760	many people have created theories over the years, including Greg himself.
2364760	2369560	For example, one situation where he diagnosed himself with Borderline Personality Disorder
2369560	2375000	to explain his volatile moods in videos regarding a relationship with another person named Adrian.
2375000	2378280	This explanation was actually initiated by one of Greg's viewers,
2378280	2381640	and this led to a saga itself where he discussed it in a video.
2383000	2387000	Hi, I just found out something great from an Onision.net member.
2387000	2389160	I have Borderline Personality Disorder.
2390920	2392120	So now we know the problem.
2392120	2396040	Although he would denounce this four years later in another video claiming to be ignorant,
2396040	2400600	it definitely represents these sort of fleeting explanations that many of his audience grapple at
2400600	2405320	to justify and understand his behavior, and maybe even explain it themselves.
2405320	2409640	In that situation, many more critical viewers have believed he was attempting to manipulate
2409640	2412520	Adrian back into a relationship with his videos,
2412520	2416680	before then scapegoating mental illness to avoid accountability for his behavior.
2416680	2420760	But hey, at least he had that elaborate backstory in trouble and pain
2420760	2424600	that reeled in so many people who felt like they knew him.
2424600	2427480	Ladies and gentlemen, they really didn't.
2428120	2433000	As mentioned, it was a guise so people would feel some sort of semblance of sympathy
2433000	2435960	for all the terrible things he did over the few years.
2435960	2441320	So before we go any further, I suggest we document the lies of Onision.
2441320	2444280	But to do that, I brought my friend once again, Jay Aubrey.
2445160	2446200	Take it away, my friend.
2451880	2455160	It's been a good few months since I've gotten to speak my shit,
2455160	2458360	but it seems Greg is just the gift that keeps on giving.
2458360	2462920	What better way to ring in the new year than by revisiting our good pal, right?
2462920	2464920	Looks like it's time for round two.
2466600	2471800	When James asked me to cover the many lies of Onision, I really didn't think it was possible.
2471800	2474920	I mean, with an online footprint as monumental as Greg's,
2474920	2479160	keeping track of every intricate fable he's spun over the past decade
2479160	2481640	is like stapling jello to a tree.
2481640	2487000	But his rampant dishonesty does go on to further illustrate the type of creature we're dealing with.
2487000	2489160	And with a timeline as clunky as this one,
2489160	2493880	I suppose it's only right we try and keep everything as concise as humanly possible.
2493880	2495960	Why don't we start at the beginning?
2495960	2501720	I was brainwashed since a child to think that America was just the greatest place on earth
2501720	2505720	and the Air Force is not full of nothing but elites, OK?
2505720	2509400	Now, before I continue, I want you guys to know none of this is confidential information.
2509400	2512280	OK, there are movies about how corrupt the military is.
2512280	2513880	It's not new news.
2513880	2518760	For years, Onision has used his veteran status to glorify his own image
2518760	2521880	while simultaneously criticizing the U.S. military.
2521880	2524840	According to Greg, he signed up for the United States Air Force
2524840	2528600	when he was 19 years old in January 2005,
2528600	2531480	not graduating boot camp until May of that year.
2531480	2534040	He joined SCRE school the following day,
2534040	2537160	but immediately dropped out after refusing to kill a rabbit
2537160	2541320	before moving to San Antonio, Texas, to begin special training in August.
2541320	2546040	He was finally deployed to South Korea before his honorable discharge in 2008,
2546040	2549640	only it wasn't as honorable as he'd like it to be.
2549640	2550280	Hey there.
2550280	2556200	So as of late, there's been a bit of debate over what my discharge was from the U.S. Air Force.
2556200	2557880	Somebody posted this to Twitter.
2557880	2560040	I thought that was interesting that someone actually went digging
2560040	2562920	to find out whatever documents are out there.
2562920	2565960	See, Greg has tried to get discharged a couple of times.
2565960	2568840	Apart from regularly uploading videos in uniform,
2568840	2572200	he also tried to convince medical professionals he was depressed,
2572200	2574760	along with stripping naked in his sergeant's office
2574760	2577880	to prove he was human and, quote, not a robot.
2577880	2581640	He got thrown in a cell and received an Article 15 for that little episode.
2581640	2584280	Probably wouldn't warrant an honorable discharge, for sure.
2584280	2587240	But Greg was adamant about this and proved his nobility
2587240	2590200	by showing off some documents as evidence in a video.
2590200	2594360	Sure enough, honorable was checked off, so everything seemed to add up.
2594360	2600280	At least until 2017, when it became public knowledge that he received a general discharge.
2600280	2602600	You guys imply that I wasn't discharged how I said I was.
2602600	2604600	I wasn't discharged honorably in any way.
2604600	2608920	And then you release a document that says I was discharged how I was described
2608920	2610920	and that I was discharged under honorable conditions.
2610920	2612120	And you know what? That's fine.
2612120	2615000	If I was discharged generally under honorable conditions,
2615000	2617000	that is still literally honorable.
2617000	2618680	By the title, it says honorable.
2618680	2622040	Receiving a general discharge under honorable conditions
2622040	2624520	is not the same as an honorable discharge.
2624520	2626200	But you know that and you still don't care.
2626200	2630600	With a discrepancy this minute, is there anything you won't lie about?
2632280	2636360	I started a religion when I was 17 called Seska.
2636360	2637560	Thank you for doing that, Dubbs.
2638440	2641400	I started a religion when I was 17 called Seska.
2641400	2646040	You know, if I had to guess, if I want to play this little religious game,
2646600	2650360	I would go with the following theories that I'm going to express over the next few days.
2650360	2655240	Since the young age of 11, Greg has denounced the teachings of the Christian church,
2655240	2660680	turning away from the Bible and embracing a unique belief system of his own, dubbed Seska.
2661560	2666120	But after being exposed for trying to turn it into a religion in 2006,
2666120	2668920	Greg denied his affiliation with the ideology,
2668920	2672680	deleting the website in a frivolous attempt to sweep the incident under the rug.
2672680	2675720	Though unfortunately for you, Greg, you can't hide from me.
2675720	2680120	According to the archived site, the lore behind Seska goes as follows.
2680120	2684680	The earth creates all energy, humans come from the earth, humans are to protect the earth,
2684680	2687720	and our bodies are used as shells to feed our spirits.
2687720	2692840	Yeah, that's a rare glimpse into the mind of an 11 year old onion right there.
2692840	2698600	The website originally stated that Seska found its way into millions of homes across the globe,
2698600	2701480	until Greg later bumped that number down to thousands.
2701480	2704760	Both, we can assume, were gross over-exaggerations meant to feed
2704760	2707400	an already inflated sense of self-importance.
2707400	2712360	Greg's religion would never meet its full potential, not only due to its insane principles,
2712360	2716520	but also his ridiculously ego-driven attempts at recruitment.
2716520	2721720	Outlined quite vividly in a 2005 email, where he depicts himself as a sociopathic,
2721720	2724840	god-like figure in search of a loyal following.
2724840	2730360	Seska would make a reappearance, however, under the religion tab of the Onision website in 2008,
2730360	2740200	writing,
2750680	2755880	Though this description barely lasted a year, disappearing from the website again before 2009.
2755880	2760680	It was later revealed through public court records that Greg had filed to have his name
2760680	2765160	legally changed to Seska at one point, perfectly demonstrating his mental
2765160	2769800	follies and further illustrating the man's twisted perception of himself.
2769800	2772920	A god whose omnipotence knows no bounds.
2775960	2781000	Though in 2013 his mastery was challenged after being called out for another infamous
2781000	2783960	controversy widely known as Turtle Gate.
2783960	2787800	I just looked up tortoise, uh, what exact kind of tortoise I have.
2787800	2791160	It's a Russian tortoise, not a desert tortoise, but guess what that means?
2791160	2795240	It means that the basking temperature of a tortoise that I had, look it up,
2795240	2798280	look up Russian tortoise, and you'll see a turtle that looked just like the,
2798280	2800920	the tortoise I had, sorry, I just keep saying turtle, it's just easy.
2800920	2804360	Anyway, Greg announced on Instagram the death of his Russian tortoise,
2804360	2808920	Reptar, with a photo of a plastic bin laying upside down in his backyard.
2808920	2813880	According to Greg, Reptar's death was not the result of heat or a lack of oxygen,
2813880	2817800	but rather a panic attack likely induced by noisy neighbors,
2817800	2822760	claiming it could not have overheated because he bought the tortoise under a heat lamp,
2822760	2826360	disputing any claims of ignorance by playing victim and labeling his
2826360	2830120	critics as hypocrites since most of them probably eat meat anyway.
2830120	2835480	You guys owe me a fucking apology, you do, all y'all, all y'all smurfs,
2835560	2840120	you don't even deserve names, you're just smurfs, okay, you smurfs, you owe me,
2840120	2845080	you owe Onision an apology, I did not kill my tortoise, you want to know why?
2845080	2852280	Because basking temperature for a tortoise is 95 motherfucking degrees, look it up motherfucker.
2852280	2856760	But in case you think his consistent incompetence is anything other than purposeful,
2856760	2859240	maybe you haven't heard about the wetlands.
2859240	2864360	See, Onision's property in Washington is actually sitting on some pretty sizable wetlands,
2864360	2868760	only he isn't allowed to do much with them, the law specifically prohibits him from damaging any
2868760	2873400	of the land surrounding these bodies of water, which is why questions began to arise after his
2873400	2878440	neighbors shot some footage of what looked like our friend doing just that. This wasn't confirmed,
2878440	2883480	of course, until Greg literally filmed himself cutting down trees in his backyard after being
2883480	2888360	explicitly told to stop, landing himself in some deep trouble with the law.
2888360	2893160	And if you talk to your neighbors and the housing organization, then guess what,
2893160	2897400	you wouldn't have gotten any fees and you would have been perfectly fine, they would have said,
2897400	2905000	yes, clear these out, it is totally okay, but no, what you did was ignore the county coming to you
2905000	2909640	and telling you that you can't do it, and then you rented a fucking bobcat and you're on video
2909640	2914680	doing it, that's what they showed in court, literally a clip of you and a bobcat mowing
2914680	2918840	down a tree. Seeing as the man isn't exactly the upstanding citizen he may claim to be,
2918840	2923640	he later emphasized that he did nothing wrong during his process of, you know, breaking the
2923640	2927960	law, but I guess it's all well and good because he still forces audience to pay for it, so I can't,
2927960	2932520	what else is new? Long story short, to all my haters, I know you're useless, irrelevant,
2932520	2937160	and wish you could be my boyfriend, but you can't, and I know that's why you hate me,
2937160	2940840	so instead of flucking me, you'll just have to settle with my parting advice,
2941720	2948120	you should fuck yourself, you should fuck yourself, you can't fuck me, so go fuck yourself,
2948840	2955240	I am a god and you are peasant scum, so get a broomstick and fuck your own bum.
2955240	2959480	Onision may not be the brightest crayon in the box when it comes to wetlands,
2959480	2964120	but he sure could teach a master class in manipulation, there's not one thing that
2964120	2968760	falls out of this cretin's mouth that you can take at face value, with his rampant
2968760	2973960	deceit dating back literal decades, I'd sooner trust James to pay me, and we all know that's a
2973960	2980120	stretch, but as one of YouTube's most prolific and notorious sociopaths, it'd be ridiculous of
2980120	2986440	us to expect anything less than unbridled deception and overt immorality. Uh, I didn't
2986440	2992440	bake my turtle, okay? That just was not, it's not possible to be hot enough, unless of course,
2992440	2997480	putting him in a plastic tub outside, a large plastic tub that has air coming into it,
2998440	3002840	and it has air coming into it, and if he wanted out, he could just dig, you know, because he's in,
3002840	3008440	he's in dirt and, and grass, he could just, because they're digging turtles, those turtles dig.
3008440	3011960	Anyway, oh, you didn't know that about the turtle either? You didn't know he's a digging turtle?
3011960	3016120	You guys don't, you need to do your research, to, to quote you, you need to do your research.
3016120	3018360	I was fucking right and you were fucking wrong, huh?
3020440	3024200	You probably still think you're a good person deep down there somewhere.
3024200	3026280	Idiots don't escape anything but reality.
3027880	3032040	There's a phrase that money does not buy happiness.
3032040	3035480	The thing is, with all these lies accounted for to many people,
3035480	3040600	they weren't lies, even if there was evidence to prove otherwise, that's the point of a cult,
3040600	3045400	people leave their reasoning at the door, and once he had that grip over a dedicated fan base,
3045400	3051320	he could move in and take what he needed. Onision is like one of those badly worded spam emails,
3051320	3056120	but in this instance, it's badly worded by design, so that only people who can't notice
3056120	3061320	its insidious nature will be interested enough to fall for it, and once they've taken the bait,
3061320	3064520	Onision moves in, like a crocodile.
3068600	3071480	This can be observed over a number of methods.
3071480	3074920	The first one, of course, is using his power to ask fans for favors.
3074920	3079800	One of the most common in this regard, especially in the YouTube regard, is money.
3079800	3084200	Now, I don't know how much money Onision has made, but he has three channels that
3084200	3089240	have all approximately amassed 2 million subscribers each with a lot of views.
3089240	3094520	Until very recently, he had a Patreon, he has his own website with ads, he sells books,
3094520	3100120	songs, even an album. Now, I highly doubt that too much of his YouTube content is now monetized,
3100120	3103720	and to be frank, for good reason, however, in a less sensorious time,
3103720	3105960	I'm sure he was making more than enough.
3105960	3109720	This is a guy who uploaded a lot, and I mean a lot.
3109720	3114200	If you consider that at the peak he was uploading onto all three of his channels,
3114200	3118360	in very short time periods, this was something he was heavily committed to,
3118360	3121240	and then you have to count all the videos he's deleted as well.
3121240	3126600	So it may come as a shock to many, when in 2017, Onision announced that actually,
3126600	3128840	he was in a serious amount of debt.
3128840	3133240	Onision's initial response, like all creators under stress, was to place his main channel
3133240	3137640	behind a paywall. After this was met with annoyance from many fans, he once again flipped
3137640	3142120	making an angry video telling people that their reluctance to support such content was because
3142120	3147480	he was worthless to them, a classic guilt trip. He goes off on this massive diatribe about people
3147480	3151240	stifling his dreams, he has truly lost his marbles.
3151240	3156040	And what I've gotten from all this is, not only am I not worth 49 cents to a lot of you guys,
3156680	3160360	but I never really had a real connection with a lot of you.
3161080	3165640	It was always about you getting something out of watching me,
3166280	3170600	and never about actually having a real bond with the person you're watching.
3170600	3177240	It's frustrating that there's such a huge amount of entitlement on this site, and no realization
3177240	3182200	or recognition for the person who's actually behind the camera, who's actually trying to
3182200	3186280	follow their dreams, rather than just fall in line with everyone else.
3186280	3193560	So when you look at the monetary aspect of $5.50 a year, or the 49 cents a month, it's not just
3193560	3198680	money. This is you establishing that you're different than everyone else and that you can
3198680	3203160	shell out half, is it a third of the candy bar? Is that a third of a candy bar that you'd be
3203160	3209400	shelling out? That you could shell out that small fraction just to actually help somebody you care
3209400	3215240	about, who you say you care about, survive the huge financial wall that's about to crush them.
3215240	3219240	Obviously, this was a terrible way to respond, and people quickly picked up on that,
3219240	3222760	and he had to change his tune, so he came back a month later,
3222760	3227160	singing a different key, and explaining the situation in a bit more depth.
3227160	3231480	Hey guys, I talked to the IRS today, and representative of taxaudit.com,
3232600	3238600	and I got some really bad news, and the bad news is that there's certain tax laws that
3239560	3247880	I did not know about, and one of these tax laws is telling you that you cannot deduct
3247880	3254440	more than 1.29th of a business property acquisition each year.
3254440	3258920	Now, initially, I didn't see anything threatening about this video. He opens up about his issue,
3258920	3263080	takes responsibility, and appears to just be asked to be able to support if they can,
3263080	3267960	which if he genuinely needed money, he could ask, and although I think anyone would be
3267960	3271400	justified in telling him that this is his fault and he doesn't need any more money,
3271400	3276120	if you actively enjoyed his content, then who am I to tell you what not to support?
3276120	3277800	In that moment, at least.
3277800	3288840	This is my screw-up. I screwed up hard. I wasn't educated on these taxes, and I used TurboTax,
3288840	3294520	and I hoped that they would educate me on those, but TurboTax didn't have a pop-up dialogue that
3294520	3302040	said, hey, when you claim this property, you can only do 1.29th of it. Never got a pop-up dialogue
3302040	3312200	saying that, so it's a tough one. I do have a Patreon, patreon.com slash onision. You guys
3312200	3317640	are keeping me going, especially now that we know I have at least $150,000 in debt.
3317640	3321960	However, not too long after, he decides to go off on another diatribe blaming an app called
3321960	3326520	TurboTax for telling him that it was unlikely he'd be audited before complaining about the
3326520	3328760	society he does indeed live in.
3328760	3333480	As for chances of me getting audited every single year, it was in the green.
3333480	3340280	TurboTax told me that it was a very low chance of me getting audited, so never trusting TurboTax again,
3340280	3347960	and surviving this is going to be rough, it's going to be heartbreaking, but this is the country we live in,
3347960	3350680	and this is the government we're dealing with.
3350680	3355960	Honestly, although I accept people can criticise the system while accepting personal responsibility,
3355960	3361480	it's a necessary part of providing perspective, I just find his tone and structure rather unsettling.
3361480	3365800	It gives me the impression that he's attempting to manipulate an audience into having the perception
3365800	3371640	that on one hand, he's remorseful, and yet it's over something that's not his fault, it's society's.
3371640	3376040	It's like he's trying to manipulate people into thinking he's wrongfully remorseful, and that he should
3377000	3382440	He also released this weird video on his main channel, which seemed semi-ironic, but then had
3382440	3388520	these very unironic statements directed at some of his exes, which I think confused the audience as much as me.
3388520	3396600	I'm now making, you know, what normal people make, and I basically am feeling suicidal because of that.
3396600	3401720	I recently went through a breakup, I dumped somebody, and they didn't worship me after, I don't know why.
3402680	3408280	I think I have an STD, I didn't cheat on Lainey, I just somehow got an STD, even though Lainey doesn't have STDs.
3410040	3415080	Still paying alimony, literally, that sucks. We divorced like six years ago, but you know,
3415080	3418680	f*** me, right? My riding lawnmower's broken, donate today.
3418680	3423560	Now, though that's my opinion on that set of videos, I'm willing to provide benefit of the doubt to a
3423560	3429560	degree that people respond to distressing situations in an often irrational way. However, Onision wasn't
3429560	3434840	finished with his crusade, and another situation which demonstrated this more clearly came into
3434840	3440040	clutch, this relating to Onision's wetlands. Onision moved into another house in the last year,
3440040	3444600	and decided that he wanted to clean out some unwanted content from these wetlands. Now, the
3444600	3450600	wetlands were a protected area, so Onision was not allowed to make too many changes to the surrounding
3450600	3455240	environment. In a legal document, it's reported that Onision wanted to clear the area for the
3455240	3459720	purpose of having a clean view of the lake, but even after being warned, he persisted, and
3459720	3462360	eventually concerned neighbors caught him on video.
3463720	3465320	Onision's Dad So, category two wetland.
3467400	3471400	There's a hundred foot buffer from the edge of the wetland for development.
3473240	3479240	Need a permit at the very least, and mitigation for clearing.
3480280	3484840	Now, there is no doubt after watching this that Onision acted recklessly, and has full
3484920	3489880	responsibility. The documents show he had been warned at point of penalty, and he persisted.
3489880	3494760	What exactly was the outcome? Well, we can't exactly be sure. We know that fines of up to
3494760	3499800	$10,000 were threatened. However, in the final legal settlement, we do know that Onision was
3499800	3505640	requested to replant all the damaged and removed items. So, after being called out by many people,
3505640	3510200	clearly annoyed at his behavior, what does he do? Well, he obviously misframes the situation for a
3510200	3515400	bit, but then in response to all this criticism, he starts a GoFundMe.
3540200	3557800	Onision's Dad This GoFundMe also received pretty immediate
3557800	3562680	backlash, and then in response, Onision turned into a bait and switch, claiming that he was
3562680	3566520	baiting people into showing that they didn't actually care about the environment because
3566520	3570600	they weren't actually concerned about his wetlands, and they didn't want to give him
3570600	3576600	money to show them that they wanted it replanted. That is some A-Star grade logic there.
3576600	3581240	Onision I didn't think anyone would donate. I was actually doing that whole thing just to make a
3581240	3585880	point, and my point was kind of destroyed when some people started donating, so...
3586760	3591640	I did get the joke, but I also feel the methodology was flawed. If he started a GoFundMe to prove that
3591640	3595880	no one actually cared or could put their money where their mouth is, surely he'd have made it
3595880	3602120	a more serious video to actually test people, and even then it fails as a concept. Anyone with
3602120	3606760	basic reasoning skills would say that donating to the untrustworthy man's crowdfunding project
3606760	3611400	to restore the garden that he destroyed would not be a good idea. Although masqueraded as a
3611400	3617480	vague point, it was once again a desperate attempt to raise money, because he does not like losing
3617480	3622680	it. He has more than enough money, no doubt about it, but he hates losing money, and around a similar
3622680	3627160	time, it appeared he also started another GoFundMe which was for a new Onision forum,
3627160	3633320	but that one is long gone. It's like a broken record running round, and round, and round.
3633320	3639720	The real campaign is a message board. I have a message board that I want to fund. I really love
3639720	3645160	forums and so forth, and I want to fund that. Onision doesn't want money because he needs it.
3645160	3651240	Onision wants money as a statement of power, and he wants to see how loyal people are to him. He
3651240	3657960	never wants to lose. It's a test of who really cares about him, not the wetlands. Onision has,
3657960	3662920	and have, multiple videos up where he has lamented the little money he makes, and yet continues to
3662920	3666840	live a life of reasonable wealth. Onision- Despite all this, despite this overwhelming debt that I
3666840	3671880	cannot pay, I don't see how I could, because I don't see how any bank is going to give me $450,000
3671880	3676680	as a loan or anything. If he cared about money as much as he claims to, he wouldn't behave so
3676760	3681480	recklessly, but like a child, it's all about how much he can get away with with the audience,
3681480	3686440	and see how they will excuse it. It's a power trip to him, and he's flying first class with
3686440	3691160	a crowdfunded ticket, but this plane is about to take one deep dive.
3700440	3706440	So Onision's pity party for favors is certainly part of how he plays with his audience's
3707320	3712040	dependence on him. However, why would he stop there? There are multiple examples that have been
3712040	3717000	documented in other people's videos for how he levies this control, but there are points that
3717000	3722520	many have argued this is pushed into rather perverse territory. Onision is a person who
3722520	3727560	doesn't hide much, and when I say that about Onision, I mean it in the most troublesome sense.
3727560	3732600	When I was working on a video for Jay Aubrey covering the relationship history of Onision,
3732600	3737240	I realised that he projected a fair amount of fetishes onto his own channel.
3737240	3742360	Onision. I'm coming for you. Jay Aubrey. Come to me. Onision. Almost there.
3742360	3750760	Jay Aubrey. Wait, what? Onision. That's right, baby. Your lips taste like cherry.
3750760	3755720	Jay Aubrey. Oh my god, no. Onision. This feels so right without whiskers. No more
3755720	3761240	sandpaper except down there. Mmm, girl. This one is from when he was having a weird
3761240	3765640	three-way relationship with two people who we'll cover in the next video. In a way,
3765640	3772040	this is presented as a funny comedy video, but it's not. It's a cuck fantasy, and this is just the
3772040	3777560	tip of the iceberg when we get down to it. There's a lot to talk about, but we'll start with the
3777560	3783400	tamer stuff, which isn't saying much. So Onision has a third channel, a commentary channel.
3783400	3789080	Uh-oh, bro. Such a nice name. Not satisfied with two channels, he started this little project in
3789080	3797240	around 2012, centering around commentary. However, this channel was very strange. It posted on some
3797240	3803400	instances very childish content, but also a lot less savory stuff. Now, obviously, we have the
3803400	3810040	wonderful Onision forums, the wholesome oasis in the barren internet desert, and uh-oh, bro has a
3810040	3815640	channel where people send him pictures of themselves, and he decides to rate them. This was also the same
3815640	3821080	channel in which he took a test to find out if he was a pedo. Excellent optics, I must add.
3821080	3825800	suggested I take a pedophile quiz, and I know a lot of you probably thought I would never take a pedophile
3825800	3831160	quiz, but I think that idea is freaking hilarious, so I'm gonna do it. In fact, this channel is quite
3831160	3836440	unpredictable in the tone, with many criticizing him for placing child-oriented content alongside
3836440	3841160	much more mature uploads. Now, if a person has a range of interests, then they are more than
3841160	3845800	welcome to express it, but I don't think those were his motives, so let's talk about this
3845800	3850760	delightful rating system. In Onision's forum, he had a place where people could post pictures of
3850760	3857080	themselves and ask to be rated. Now, I admittedly find the concept alone rather strange. I understand
3857080	3863160	why people send pictures to be roasted, or complimented maybe, but to be rated by Onision,
3863160	3869320	well, strikes me as a bit off, and Onision has a habit of making everything strangely personal,
3869320	3890680	as always. And even unsettling.
3899320	3910200	I'll add a minor caveat that those clips were from a video on his Onision Speaks channel,
3910200	3915000	although he has done videos on both channels with similar tones, the comments from that video in
3915000	3920120	particular were just a personal favourite. I mean, if you gave it a passing glance, you may not see
3920120	3925480	anything dangerous about it on principle, it's just with the context of his other work considered,
3925480	3931240	he probably shouldn't be rating people, and with the latest clip, he's made it 100% clear he has no
3931240	3937000	issue if they're underage. I'll be honest, I'm not exactly sure what barometer he's rating these
3937000	3941000	people on, I'm sure many of us have told other people they look good or they look nice as a good
3941000	3945400	compliment, as a way to maybe encourage them or provide them with confidence, but the sort of
3945400	3951960	dynamic he's operating is slightly strange. He's a large creator, he knows his power, he knows he's
3951960	3956680	gonna have a load of young fangirls who want to appear in these videos because he's popular.
3957240	3962280	That was probably the major complaint relating to this content, this extended to individual cases,
3962280	3967080	including a woman who claimed to be the sister of an 11 year old child who posted a picture in the
3967080	3971800	forum to be rated. Onision states that he likes to keep his children off the internet due to
3971800	3977000	these communities, and yet actively engages them when they're not his own. Despite knowing the risk
3977000	3981640	and the amount of creeps online who would take advantage of this sort of content, I dislike the
3981640	3986440	whole dynamic, I think it's unhealthy, and I think given the context we're aware of, once again it
3986440	3991800	was a power trip that Onision likes to feel control over his fan base, the idea that he can provide
3991800	3996840	his personal approval to people and they can be recognised by him. I mean, of course Onision put
3996840	4001400	out a condescending response video where he stated that the fact that he placed disclaimer in the
4001400	4007080	forum stating it was 18 plus was, of course, reasonable precautions. Excluding his other
4007080	4012760	comments that make it look very flimsy, people were not buying it at all, and people didn't
4012760	4018360	think that Onision really had the protection of children at the centre of his heart.
4018360	4022040	Onision- First off, I want to establish that the forum specifically stated 18 plus only, so if you
4022040	4026360	submitted a photo and you're not 18 plus, you either weren't paying attention or you're a liar.
4026360	4033240	Either way, shame on you. It's not just a simple thing, it's Onision taking what he can get, and as
4033240	4037720	we know from his history, he doesn't have many limits, and he has curated an audience who will
4037720	4042760	consent to him doing anything and supporting him through multiple controversies, and the fact that
4042760	4047640	this sort of thing happened for years without anyone being able to take him down a notch was
4047640	4053320	a testament to the commitment of many of his most dedicated audiences. Uh-oh bro seemed cultivated
4053320	4057480	towards reeling children in with seemingly childish videos and then involving them in his
4057480	4065160	much more mature rating game, and other videos of the sorts. It was a trap. Onision's sexual desires,
4065160	4070760	paired with the immaturity of his tone on many of his videos, is a concerning combination for many
4070760	4076680	apparent. It was Spider-Man and Elsa, but more subtle. However, the notion of subtlety had worn
4076680	4081480	thin by 2019, as his Twitter became something else altogether.
4087080	4092920	Hello everyone, my name is Fainted, and today the right opinion has kindly requested that I use my
4092920	4102440	professional tweet reading skills to narrate some Onision tweets, and um, it's about to get pretty
4102440	4107880	graphic. Just a warning. I don't care if you hate yourself after you masturbate to me, I just want
4107880	4114600	you to be satisfied. Just woke up with an erection. Will you take care of it for me? We'll make you
4114600	4121480	breakfast while you recover. Bro, give up on lesbians. They will never be into you. If they are,
4121480	4128280	they're not lesbians. I need more cute British accents in my life. Well, this may be the video
4128280	4133960	for you, my friend. We've got the right opinion. We got Fainted. What more could you want? I love the
4133960	4139720	look in your eyes when you realize my baby is growing inside you. You know, I'm kind of over
4139720	4144840	denying how incredible I am. Your screams of pleasure say it all. I wouldn't fuck you if I
4144840	4150200	didn't think you were beautiful. I wouldn't come inside you if I didn't think it belonged in you.
4150200	4156120	You were made to be fucked by me. Others may hate you, but they don't win unless you hate them.
4157080	4162760	In other news, wanna give me a blowjob? They say when you have sex with someone, a piece of them
4162760	4168840	follows you for life. I'm cool with that. Everyone has something beautiful about them. My best moments
4168840	4174920	are spent unloading inside of you. Oh wow, I really hope my parents weren't listening when I was
4174920	4179720	recording that. The true colors were showing, and people were starting to pay much more attention to
4179720	4186360	his reckless behavior. But there was a lot of digging to do. Over the years, whether it was the
4186360	4199800	lies, contradiction, infidelity, animal abuse, many people stood by him. But even worse, people went to
4199800	4205640	him. I wish we were near the end, but we are not. And that's why you should join me in part two,
4205720	4210760	where we talk about the individual cases, and the mentality of the man behind them.
4211880	4217640	So yes, that was the video. I want to thank all my collaborators who've done such a fantastic job.
4217640	4223800	Your contributions are greatly appreciated, and I'm sending my love to all of you. I don't really
4223800	4229000	have too much else to add to this video. As said, stay tuned. Wanna give a big shout out to my
4229000	4235320	editors, my patreons, editors and patreons together. Imagine that, that would be wild.
4235320	4241240	But yeah, my editors, check them all out. Patreons on the screen right now, I've got a few individual
4241240	4247320	thanks to give. I wanna give a big shout out to my $50 patreons, Sam Hallabaloo, Nico Deschamps,
4247320	4254040	and Caroline, and a very special thanks to my $100 patreons, Brandon and Stanton. Stanton's a new
4254040	4261000	guy. Thank you again, Brandon's a classical OG, thank you too. If you wanna reach me, my Twitter
4261000	4266680	is at TheRightOpinion, Facebook, TheRightOpinionOfficial, Discord, in the pinned comment,
4266680	4272280	Instagram as well. As said, I don't really have too much else to add, I'm gonna go die now,
4272280	4278840	so I hope you guys stay tuned for when I re-emerge for part two. Hopefully not too long in the future,
4278840	4283800	because I wanna keep everything on a relatively tight schedule. Thank you. So until then,
4283800	4287160	I'm TheRightOpinion, and I will see you in the next one.
