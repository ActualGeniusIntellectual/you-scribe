1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,720
Life. It's a thing. That happens. To pretty much everyone in some capacity.

2
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:24,160
From the day that life begins to the day it ends, it encompasses an experience unique to that individual.

3
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,600
How that individual may interpret their own life is also something unique,

4
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:34,000
although there are overarching categories that we may relate, such as happiness, sadness, or in my case, boredom.

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,880
People's lives beyond one's own, and their own interpretations of it, have become much more intimate to audiences

6
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:46,560
over the rise of YouTube. We often see what a person may be going through, but we also may see how they react to it,

7
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:52,400
and how they interpret it themselves. How much of your life ends up on the internet is principally your discretion,

8
00:00:52,400 --> 00:01:00,080
though there are often exceptions. Today's topic, Onision, is someone who's life, on the surface, seems like the pinnacle

9
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:04,320
of YouTube melodrama, and the eventful nature that surrounds it.

10
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:16,320
For over ten years, he has projected his life into the public sphere. He has made countless videos and posts

11
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,960
regarding his past, present, and future. He has been the center of numerous controversies,

12
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:28,960
and the subject of multiple exposes involving his friends, enemies, and so many more people that I cannot even begin to factor in.

13
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:35,680
When serious drama occurs, the stress and additional repercussions will often drive many off online platforms.

14
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:42,080
Onision is a clear exception to that rule, in fact, attention just seems to bring him back with even more aggression,

15
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:46,680
so I didn't want to make this video under the pretense that it wasn't going to play into his hands.

16
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:52,880
In fact, even Onision wants me to make this video on him, though I'm not sure it will be exactly what he hoped for.

17
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:58,400
He did contact me stating that if I'm interested, he can offer evidence to exonerate him of certain claims.

18
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:02,880
However, over the last couple of months, I have already grown an aversion to such private interactions,

19
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,560
I'm not going to be a YouTuber's shield when they have more than enough platforms to defend themselves already.

20
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,720
Anything that someone wants me to present in public, they can present it themselves.

21
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:17,560
Today's video is going to be a look at as much published, and the attempt to understand what that says about the person in question,

22
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:24,440
and maybe a few laughs and jokes along the way, but given the volume there is to look at, it's hard to tell exactly where to start.

23
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:32,040
I guess the best place is a brief history of Onision, but trying to summarise exactly what has happened there is a task much easier said than done.

24
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:38,280
What we could really use is a historian, for the internet, you know, an internet historian of sorts.

25
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:47,400
Oh, what's that? He's busy. Doing raid sponsorships. Well, that's fine. I didn't want him anyway. I know someone better.

26
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:52,560
Hey, hello, thanks for having me on, that's really nice of you. I'm very happy to be here, actually.

27
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:59,600
I hope everyone's just having a fantastic day. My name is Pinely, I also have a YouTube channel that you should really subscribe to.

28
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:06,280
And fun fact about me, I'm actually a pretty massive Onision fan. I think he is just the best.

29
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:10,640
I don't want Mulder to take me to Area 51!

30
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:15,400
Oh, he's so swell. How could he even not like this fine young man?

31
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:21,560
You know, I remember how a few years ago I was watching him dancing around and singing in that banana costume,

32
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:26,000
and at that moment I was thinking to myself, damn, I guess this is it.

33
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,880
This is where comedy has truly reached its peak, and since I'm such a massive fanboy of Greg,

34
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:35,120
I've actually made sure to keep track of everything this man has ever done since he was born.

35
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,840
So this is what we're gonna talk about today in Pinely's Corner.

36
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,160
Greg's various projects from before he started his YouTube channel.

37
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,680
Ready? Okay.

38
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:49,720
So back in 2002, when Greg was just a 17-year-old boy, he created this very cool website called Hybrid Eye.

39
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:53,920
As you can see, the design is really scary... and orange.

40
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,120
Let's read the description, shall we, folks?

41
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:03,240
Please feel free to browse all of the links. If done so, you will find many intriguing pieces of literature and graphics.

42
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:06,120
Some areas of Hybrid Eye will have a symbol like...

43
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:12,360
Oh, basically stating that the words or images could be slightly disturbing to those under the age of 14.

44
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,160
And sadly, some in their 40s.

45
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:19,720
Greg also decided to call himself Odd on this website, that was his name.

46
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,520
Just so you guys can know that he's really weird.

47
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,600
He's not really your average Joe.

48
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:30,200
He makes really deep poems about religion, the Stone Age, and some other sensitive stuff.

49
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:34,920
That website lasted a whole year before eventually collapsing into itself and dying.

50
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:39,960
He later moved on to making quite a lot of gaming related websites with a friend of his called Jad.

51
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:45,160
They had one about Metal Gear Solid and a game review website called Gamer's Shadow.

52
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,480
Apparently, there was some drama surrounding that one.

53
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:50,920
Some evil people were making fun of poor old Greg.

54
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,480
So yeah, he had to ban all of them.

55
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:56,120
2003 was also a pretty busy year for him.

56
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:01,880
He made yet another gaming website with his friend called Extreme Gaming Headquarters.

57
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,240
Yeah, you heard that right.

58
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,440
It's extreme.

59
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:07,640
You can see from the design of it just how extreme it really is.

60
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:15,640
The Extreme Gaming Headquarters is an online gaming society made up of elite gaming fans and pros.

61
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:19,560
He also created like a billion different websites for web hosting,

62
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,800
website promotion, and website developing.

63
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,280
But that's kind of boring, so I'm not gonna dwell on that.

64
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:30,360
More importantly, he made another website to show off all of his literature and poems and whatnot.

65
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,680
It's exactly what's been missing from my life.

66
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,400
First off, again, a sick design.

67
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,920
Looks real futuristic.

68
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,920
And what's really good about this website

69
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,960
is that I was actually able to find some of the pieces that were on it.

70
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,920
So I hope you're ready to hear one of them because here we go.

71
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,560
What is a pointless fight?

72
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,760
Why do senseless conflicts happen?

73
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,240
Who are the ones who fall victim to these battles?

74
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:58,840
Over the past, humanity has been damaged deeply by pathetic and disgraceful wars

75
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:02,360
that happened both between politicians and among average peasants.

76
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,640
Today, smaller verbal battles occur all over our schools.

77
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,200
An individual calls another a foul name,

78
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:11,720
and immediately the victims think they have some sort of honor to defend.

79
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,720
And this resorts to a fight.

80
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,160
I find this very funny.

81
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,840
This is clearly a guy who really wants you to think that he's so, so smart.

82
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,480
When in reality, that's not really too accurate.

83
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,520
Average peasants.

84
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,400
Jesus Christ.

85
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,240
Then we reach 2004.

86
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,400
Greg graduated from high school,

87
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,120
and you can really tell that at this point he was all like,

88
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,000
Oh, well, I'm not going to see any of these people ever again.

89
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,640
You know what?

90
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:37,240
I might as well just show off my really, really awful opinions,

91
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,520
because why the hell not?

92
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,760
And that's exactly what he did later that year.

93
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:45,000
So the first website he made in 2004 was definitely not as bad as the second one.

94
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,800
Greg would just talk about some radio show he liked.

95
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,080
I don't really care.

96
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:52,760
Later on, around a year later, he turned that site into a website all about him.

97
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,440
The Gregory J website.

98
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:58,920
He also made this one really, really, really stupid website.

99
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:02,440
I think it also showcases what kind of person we're really dealing with here.

100
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,840
The site was called Rape Prevention Info.

101
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:05,480
Yikes.

102
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,320
And here's the description of it.

103
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,320
My name is Gregory J. Daniel.

104
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,560
I am a man of dignity and integrity.

105
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:16,520
And today I look at our society in recognition of what mockery we have become

106
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:21,240
due to lack of enforcement of rape crimes that occur every moment of every day.

107
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:25,800
Not too long ago, I was appalled by suggestions that women dressed themselves up as if they were

108
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,400
homeless or mentally handicapped just to avoid an attack.

109
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:33,400
This is terrible advice, as hostiles do not always choose based on attraction.

110
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,800
They do it off of who looks most vulnerable.

111
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,520
Weakest.

112
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,600
Today, you will learn how to defend yourself.

113
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,480
When you are through, you will find what true freedom is.

114
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:45,640
Dress how you like, live how you like, and be ready for the worst.

115
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:51,560
For if you are, no attacker will ever be able to walk away without they themselves being a victim.

116
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:55,960
I don't know what made him think this is a good call to make this website.

117
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,120
He's just so clearly full of himself.

118
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:02,920
You can just see that he thought that he's some sort of savior for all women all around the world.

119
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,120
I know, you might say,

120
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:07,400
Oh, finally, he was just trying to help people out.

121
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,000
Why are you being like this, man?

122
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,720
Well, I don't know if that's really something that could be said.

123
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,280
When some of the advice that he gave is stuff like,

124
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,160
I don't know.

125
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:19,000
Act like you are possessed by a demon or mentally handicapped.

126
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,400
Oh, and who can forget about have a bowel movement and rub it in his face.

127
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:28,360
In 2005, he went on to make another website dedicated to documenting his time in the army.

128
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,920
And then a year later, he found himself on YouTube.

129
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,560
And I think I'll let the right opinion continue from here.

130
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,800
Thank you all for having me on this channel.

131
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,440
And hey, make sure to subscribe to Pinely.

132
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:41,080
It would make me feel really good and happy.

133
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:47,480
Oh, guys, look, it's the Internet Historian.

134
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:47,980
Yay!

135
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,440
Uh, thank you, thank you.

136
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,240
Is Tro here?

137
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,080
Uh, no, I don't think so.

138
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:53,880
Good.

139
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,480
Why are you running a balaclava?

140
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,560
Showman here.

141
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,480
That's right, I'm even on other channels.

142
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,320
Have you heard about Rayman Legends?

143
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:04,520
It's a new game sweeping the nation like a deadly virus.

144
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:07,400
And now it's coming for you and your family.

145
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:11,240
Play clip of large crowd of people talking about Raid.

146
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,080
You haven't heard of Raid Shadow Legends?

147
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:16,280
Raid Shadow Legends is a free RPG PVP.

148
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,480
Look at those ratings.

149
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,760
People are going wild.

150
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,160
That one didn't look too wild.

151
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,840
Here's a more measured review.

152
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:26,520
It has over 15 million downloads in the last six months.

153
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:30,360
That's over three times the population of the Central African Republic.

154
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,880
And six months, that's over three times the average lifespan.

155
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,640
Wow, impressive.

156
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,280
In fact, I'm so impressed, I'm flying there right now.

157
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,800
Please put your phone away, sir.

158
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,680
We are about to take-

159
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,720
Just fuck off, lady.

160
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:45,880
I'm customizing over 400 champions that I can collect in the game.

161
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,160
Raid Shadow Legends, huh?

162
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,160
Sir, please, the plane is about to crash.

163
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,400
Wow, what a spectacular view.

164
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,680
Almost as spectacular as the 13 unique in-game-

165
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,480
True, how much longer does this ad go for?

166
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,760
Speaking of dungeons,

167
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:04,520
make sure you participate in the weekly events to win extra prizes.

168
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,200
The prizes are off the charts.

169
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,920
I can barely contain my excitement.

170
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,520
They've even got a new roadmap.

171
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,840
Who needs Google Maps when you have this baby?

172
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,960
You can play with me, too.

173
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,320
Please raid someone.

174
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,840
I'm gonna raid Shadow Legends.

175
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,840
And you should, too.

176
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23,320
Click on the link and claim your epic new hero

177
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:27,240
and 50,000 non-transferable pieces of silver on...

178
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,440
Raid Shades of Light.

179
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:34,840
I do sincerely hope you all feel enlightened, because I know I sure do.

180
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:38,120
But this is the last non-dramatic phase that we'll be covering,

181
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,800
because Onision, believe it or not, is quite a dramatic person.

182
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:46,360
Now, that was a rather neutral, albeit humorous, perspective on Onision's background prior,

183
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,840
and during his ascent on this beautiful platform.

184
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:53,400
As noted, he was a real veteran of the internet who had a vision of where he wanted to be,

185
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:57,080
before many people had even realised the potential of online stardom.

186
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:01,800
But he was much more a person who tended to fire whatever at the wall with the hope it would stick,

187
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,200
and that formula would not deviate with YouTube.

188
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:08,840
Old YouTube was created off the basis of weird, wacky, and typically quite annoying.

189
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:14,040
The obsession with LeFunny voice and LeFunny face is what bolstered Onision's career,

190
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:18,520
but there was something edgier to what he made, though not always.

191
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:35,480
You see, Onision was more than just a performative persona, like many creators at the time.

192
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:39,160
If you were going off his main channel, you probably would have the impression that he takes

193
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:43,480
pride, and maybe even catharsis, in a slightly unstable character.

194
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:47,880
However, it didn't stop there, Onision had created a more personal side to him.

195
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,920
This would mainly be projected on the Onision Speaks channel,

196
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:54,600
although it did sometimes spill over to the other sides of the internet.

197
00:11:54,600 --> 00:12:00,120
Imagine if Fred started a channel where he scrapped the funny voice and began discussing abortion.

198
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,880
That was basically what Onision Speaks was to Onision,

199
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:08,760
but I think this quickly spelled out two things to a large majority of the audiences.

200
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:13,160
Firstly, that Onision's personal life was going to become a very public matter,

201
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:16,760
and secondly, my god, Onision likes to talk about himself.

202
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:21,880
Now, narcissism is a trait found in a fair few creators, and it's not always disruptive,

203
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:27,000
but with Onision it was a different brand, and many audiences played into that brand,

204
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,720
whether that attention was positive or negative.

205
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:33,560
One thing that I would say is that the design of the brand Onision Speaks,

206
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:38,680
initially being an outlet of Onision rather than making it a more personal venture to him,

207
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:42,840
showed the proximity of the Onision brand to our friend Greg here,

208
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:46,200
so he probably weren't going to receive the best dose of sanity.

209
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,800
A great example was his early crusade against meat-eaters.

210
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:54,760
Onision's main channel would put out some wacky video, maybe with an underlying message,

211
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,000
but you wouldn't take it too seriously.

212
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,560
Onision Speaks- If you feel kicking an animal isn't right,

213
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:02,680
if you think that torturing living creatures is wrong,

214
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:05,880
and yet you yourself still consume animals,

215
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,480
don't even waste your breath, Moo.

216
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,160
Don't waste our time, Moo.

217
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:12,440
You're just as bad as the people that slit our throats, Moo.

218
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:18,120
And Onision would come in and undercut that with a clarification about how this wacky message

219
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:21,880
was actually very authentic, and you should definitely listen to it.

220
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:25,080
Onision Speaks- Vegans do what they do out of necessity.

221
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,560
They save animals by doing what they do.

222
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:31,400
They save themselves by doing what they do.

223
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:35,960
Meat-eaters do what they do for whatever reason they do.

224
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,720
Slowly killing themselves.

225
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:42,280
Onision was online, and alongside came a close-up documenting of his life,

226
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:47,160
and the next decade of relationships and drama that we will have the displeasure of covering

227
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,160
over however long this takes.

228
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:53,720
In many ways, it'd be convenient to create a linear timeline of Onision's behaviour,

229
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:57,000
but honestly, I don't think that we'll be able to do that justice,

230
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,640
because that implies a simple rationalisation,

231
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:03,240
or at least explanation that can be observed in a chronological way.

232
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:07,960
And let's face it, Onision isn't exactly known for his rational behaviour,

233
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:12,280
so we're going to be doing a documenting of all of it, all over the board,

234
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:15,000
and seeing what exactly it tells us.

235
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,960
Let's start small and move on to greater things.

236
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:23,000
I'd also like to preface the fact that I've split this video into three rather meaty parts,

237
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,040
and apologise for any inconvenience that may cause.

238
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,960
I hope they will all be worth their time.

239
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:32,840
Onision has been relatively successful given his stint on YouTube,

240
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,240
and success means you're doing something right.

241
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:40,040
I think for this part, it's best we look at that before delving into the darker side.

242
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:43,400
Now, I said at the start that Onision clearly enjoys attention,

243
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:48,440
and I do believe, to an extent, that motivation is the real bedrock of his content.

244
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:51,240
Now, so what? A lot of people enjoy attention,

245
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:54,120
and even if the subject matters were a bit socially loaded,

246
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:58,920
you could take a lot of his earlier content as somewhat removed from the constraints of discourse,

247
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,920
even if they were bizarre as hell.

248
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:03,800
Nonetheless, the desire for attention manifests itself,

249
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:07,240
particularly when you, as a creator, have very little to offer.

250
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:11,800
And let's be honest here, Onision isn't the most inherently talented person,

251
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,760
he couldn't really sing, he couldn't really act,

252
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:18,840
he didn't really have any exceptionally insightful social commentary,

253
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:21,160
all he knew was about attention,

254
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:25,240
and as people's bar for comedy and other creative content was rising,

255
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,080
Onision wasn't changing.

256
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:30,600
In spite of this, there is a key to maintaining internet relevance,

257
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,320
and that's creating a relationship with your audience.

258
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,800
Relationships can be created over different mediums,

259
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:40,600
but for many creators, that relationship can be as simple as sharing experiences.

260
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,400
Sometimes a creator will make more personal videos to do that,

261
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,640
sometimes that means breaking character.

262
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:49,560
With Onision, openness became a gimmick, there was nothing off limits.

263
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,880
When many creators open up, we will see it as brave,

264
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,200
as it's often a risking element to their persona.

265
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:59,400
With Onision Speaks, every time he spoke about something, it tackled sensitive topics,

266
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,720
and even if the views themselves weren't the greatest,

267
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,200
he was developing something of a cult persona.

268
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:07,640
It also allowed him to tackle more serious topics with a degree of clout.

269
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:10,440
He would upload videos on an incredibly regular basis,

270
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:14,600
and it provided a medium to create a closer relationship with Daddy over here.

271
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:18,040
I don't really know where I stand on a few issues,

272
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:24,440
if I am the villain or the hero, if I am good or pure evil myself.

273
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:28,920
If by doing everything the right way, the way that I thought was best,

274
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,680
was really even the right way at all.

275
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:36,200
Because it seems that by doing the things that I feel makes this world better,

276
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:39,320
or doing the things that I feel make me a good person,

277
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:47,560
I am in fact contradicting everyone else, and I wonder if wrong is right and I am wrong.

278
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:50,120
You have to remember that we're in 2010,

279
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:53,960
a time when many of the largest creators wouldn't be considered celebrities,

280
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,920
so many of them would have a decent interaction with their audience.

281
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:01,000
Onision at that point was in the top 100 most subscribed creators,

282
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,200
as strange as that is,

283
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:05,480
so having a channel which allowed people to become closer with him

284
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,360
was a strong foundation for a more dedicated fanbase,

285
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,520
and the fact that he had that level of attention at all

286
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,840
would mean that there would always be a certain amount of people

287
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:15,640
who idolized him for that popularity alone.

288
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:19,800
However, not necessarily satisfied with the simplicity of a regular fanbase,

289
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:24,440
Onision always had a slightly different approach to developing his fanbase beyond.

290
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,520
You cannot choose who supports you,

291
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:31,240
however, your actions and behavior can definitely shape your audience to a reasonable degree,

292
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:34,440
particularly if you know how to exclude a demographic.

293
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:39,080
This can be done, for example, by taking advantage of polarizing insensitive topics.

294
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:43,240
Now, it's hard to say I know too many people who actively shape their audience,

295
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:47,480
it's something hard to do if you're just trying to make content for yourself,

296
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:50,600
but I am of the belief that Onision definitely did.

297
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:54,200
I'll explain more soon, but first I want to focus on his techniques.

298
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:58,840
And what this all clearly comes down to is if you are pro-circumcision,

299
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,720
then you are helping the rapist.

300
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:04,040
You cannot feel with something that does not exist,

301
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,120
and when you promote the removal of the foreskin,

302
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,360
not only are you making the penis less sensitive,

303
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,760
but you are also desensitizing it to pain.

304
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:14,440
A pain that is intended to naturally occur in the uncircumcised penis of a man

305
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:18,280
who is attempting to destroy a woman both physically and psychologically.

306
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,600
One thing that Onision knew was how to provoke.

307
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,000
He was never one to be afraid of confrontation,

308
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,840
and confrontation is sometimes a good way to really build an audience.

309
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,480
If you pick a point of view or a strong opinion,

310
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:33,720
you will find an audience who will respect your outspoken and confident demeanor,

311
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:36,920
even if you have no actual clue what you're speaking about.

312
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:41,000
Onision was not qualified in any of the topics that he spoke about to my knowledge,

313
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,320
but he tackled them nonetheless.

314
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:47,160
Obviously, this sort of drama was documented with his meat-eater's content.

315
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:50,200
However, over the years, he would regularly have public fallings out,

316
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,120
with whoever he could manage.

317
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:56,840
Sorry, I'm just starting to get really sick of hearing about this asshole starting a new drama,

318
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,120
and he can sit back and say,

319
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:01,960
oh, he's learned his lesson and it's so hard having these opinions,

320
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:06,680
and we all know in another three months when his views start to plateau again,

321
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,520
that he's gonna start some new shit.

322
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:11,320
From 2010, when he had a feud with Shay Carl,

323
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,880
over Shay's decision to circumcise his son,

324
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,440
to 2016, when he had a feud with Cyr,

325
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:19,720
because he voted for a third-party candidate in California.

326
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,120
These are the sorts of ideologically loaded topics

327
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:25,240
that would obviously attract fans and critics alike.

328
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:28,360
He would regularly express controversial opinions on rape,

329
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:32,920
self-harm, suicide, and multiple other issues that would really rile people up.

330
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,320
He would also regularly go after multiple creators

331
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:38,600
whose content and audience may even overlap into his,

332
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,440
such as his feud with Shane Dawson,

333
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:43,080
a person who he collaborated with, was friends with,

334
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,000
and even shared a romantic kiss with.

335
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,400
Yet, in spite of this,

336
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,560
him and Shane had a significant amount of drama,

337
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:53,560
particularly relating to how Onision felt Shane had treated him as a friend,

338
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:56,120
which there may be some legitimate annoyance in.

339
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:59,640
However, since then, Onision just made multiple videos on Shane Dawson,

340
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,240
mostly attempting to call him out,

341
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:05,800
but often just trying to work out a way to bring problems back to how Shane had treated him.

342
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,600
Shane Dawson.

343
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,080
Oh God, Onision's making another video about him.

344
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,080
But talking about him has a lot of advantages.

345
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,920
Number one, his name attracts video views.

346
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,240
Number two, on a regular basis, people imply that I look like him,

347
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,640
which gives me this immortal, annoying association.

348
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,240
Number three, I really don't like him,

349
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,240
and ranting about him is therapeutic for me.

350
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:24,760
The one time that Onision did try and make a more serious call-out video

351
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:27,800
is in the form of this 50 millet pseudo-documentary,

352
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,840
in which he states that he believes Shane Dawson is a pedophile.

353
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,320
Actually, no, that would be unfair.

354
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:36,120
He doesn't say for certain he's a pedophile,

355
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:39,560
he just goes through talking about how Shane Dawson fulfills

356
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:42,760
a large majority of the prerequisites to being a child predator.

357
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:47,160
Wait, Shane Dawson just said that he doesn't tell those jokes anymore.

358
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,800
So lying is obviously the number one tactic of predators,

359
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,080
as you can see at the top right here.

360
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,640
Not telling the whole story, that's what Shane did

361
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:57,400
by not addressing every single clip that he says was taken out of context,

362
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:00,840
but instead he only addressed one where he proved that it was taken out of context.

363
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:05,320
He was jumping all over the place with mood swings by screaming and cussing

364
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,800
and then being all normal and then getting kind of emotional.

365
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,440
The punishment again is the yelling and the cussing.

366
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,960
The denial is very clear.

367
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:15,800
Finning the truth, trying to devalue everything that's said about him

368
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:19,000
by saying it's all just jokes and that he was saying messed up jokes,

369
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,800
but never really again telling the whole story

370
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,760
like him trying to justify people being a pedo.

371
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,800
Where in one podcast he said that he didn't view it as very different

372
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,480
from people who have foot fetishes.

373
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:32,680
Or the clip that I played you where he states that he doesn't understand

374
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:35,480
why people get arrested for looking at children who are not clothed.

375
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,840
And again, that's minimalizing.

376
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,680
And then of course he went to play the victim.

377
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:42,680
You could say he targeted the victim, i.e. people calling him out,

378
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:45,240
but the real victims are to be determined,

379
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:50,680
because so far all he said is that he googled actual children in that situation.

380
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:53,000
So I guess it would be all the children that he googled

381
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,840
and describe the results that he saw.

382
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:57,960
These were claims he reiterated for a significant amount of time,

383
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,760
and although he did apologize approximately five months ago,

384
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:04,360
it is undisputed that this feud likely alienated audiences

385
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,840
who may have found Onision through Shane's content,

386
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,560
something that Onision does acknowledge himself.

387
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:13,560
Now, to be frank, I think the treatment of Shane by Onision has been rather poor,

388
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:17,320
given the number of videos made, the tone of these videos, and the message.

389
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,960
However, you could at least make the rational argument that

390
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:22,840
Onision was bitter and upset about a friendship.

391
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:26,520
What would happen if we went one step further and visited a situation

392
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:30,840
where there was no way of stating any coherent explanation together,

393
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:34,040
and yet as of right now, it is probably one of the key examples

394
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,720
to the next point in my video.

395
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,560
But maybe to illuminate this situation,

396
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:40,920
we should spin the wheel and see which commentator can help me out.

397
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,680
Take it away, my G.

398
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:48,200
Well, mom, I finally made it.

399
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,360
I'm on the right opinion.

400
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,880
But I'm talking about Onision.

401
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:02,120
I'm currently a bit under the weather, but never as sick as my buddy Greg,

402
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:06,520
the man who obsessively harassed, mocked, and exploited a fellow YouTuber

403
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:09,080
with an eating disorder for nearly three years.

404
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:11,480
I'm of course referring to Eugenia Cooney.

405
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:15,560
If anybody was in the dark about Eugenia Cooney and her controversial time on YouTube,

406
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,040
Shane Dawson swooped in and filled everybody in.

407
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:22,280
But if you're still out of the loop, Eugenia Cooney was your average 2013 YouTuber,

408
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:27,080
just a happy young girl doing Q&As, participating in tags, and showing off outfits.

409
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:30,840
Fast forward three years where a man named Greg would make a video on her,

410
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:33,000
and unfortunately, change her life.

411
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,280
And just so you're aware, the majority of these videos are AWOL in the shadow realm,

412
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,040
because deleting evidence is always fun.

413
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,800
But thankfully, they've all been documented.

414
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:43,960
Believe it or not, but the first video that Onision made on Eugenia Cooney on May 9th,

415
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:46,200
2016 was actually defending her.

416
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:49,960
I mean, with a title like Eugenia Cooney is anorexic, you wouldn't think so,

417
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:54,440
but Onision simply compared her body to a supermodel's, claiming they weren't that different.

418
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:58,120
Four months later, Onision's opinion quickly changed with the titled video,

419
00:23:58,840 --> 00:23:59,800
Eugenia Cooney.

420
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:04,200
And a whopping 10 Eugenia videos would follow in the next two months.

421
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:10,120
Onision was clearly worried about paying rent or something because it became very apparent

422
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:14,040
that Eugenia was more so a cash cow to Onision than a charity case.

423
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:17,240
A supposed cry for help became a target on Eugenia's back.

424
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:22,280
Onision would urge his viewers to unsubscribe to Eugenia if she did not gain weight in a

425
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:26,520
certain amount of time, claiming that if you continued supporting her, you would be helping

426
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,080
her die.

427
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:30,360
Now, thankfully, Onision announced in early October of that year that

428
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:34,280
he had no plans about making any more Eugenia videos in the future.

429
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,000
But tweets?

430
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:35,880
That's fair game.

431
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:36,840
At Onision,

432
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:40,120
Give her a more I care about you but I'm not humiliating you approach.

433
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:43,080
Tried that, but Eugenia, the obvious sociopath

434
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:47,080
Onision accused people of being a sociopath before it was cool

435
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:50,200
continues to inspire young girls to starve themselves regardless.

436
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:53,080
At Onision, you think humiliating her is the way to fix it?

437
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,400
If someone is without any doubt killing themselves,

438
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:58,280
bringing attention to their condition is the least you could do.

439
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,880
Anorexia is lethal.

440
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,040
Greg has a funny way of responding to people.

441
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,520
Yeah, I'll take a voting the question for 500 Alex.

442
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:07,480
Shortly after a petition was made to get Eugenia off YouTube,

443
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:12,040
Onision just couldn't help himself and off the wagon he went.

444
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,560
This would quickly become a trend.

445
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:16,680
Onision would say he's resigning on the topic of Eugenia,

446
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:20,040
but then proceed to talk about Eugenia because

447
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:23,560
Last time I checked, when you resign from something, you can take it up again if you choose.

448
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,680
Why even say that Greg?

449
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,480
The hell's the point?

450
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:28,520
Just say the possibility is always there or don't cap it off.

451
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,800
Just just leave it.

452
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:34,280
Regardless of what somebody is saying, you should always look at their intent.

453
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,400
Why are they doing this?

454
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:38,840
Onision could push his anti-anorexia campaign all he wanted,

455
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:41,080
but as long as he kept uploading videos like this

456
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:53,640
His intent was clear.

457
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,840
Now sure, some could say,

458
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:58,920
well his method of saving Eugenia is abrasive, but it could prove effective.

459
00:25:58,920 --> 00:25:59,960
I wouldn't be so sure.

460
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:02,280
This is essentially the equivalent of fat-shaming,

461
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:05,640
which according to a professor of health psychology at the University of Sarain,

462
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:10,200
a 2019 article from BBC, shaming is the wrong way to move forward.

463
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:14,200
Even in the example of somebody claiming fat-shaming led to them losing weight,

464
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:17,880
Professor Jane Ogden says that experience is atypical.

465
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:22,520
At this point, Greg's videos were garnering hundreds of thousands, if not millions of views.

466
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:25,640
So it wasn't a surprise when the milkman kept chugging away.

467
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,400
I have nipples, Greg. Could you milk me?

468
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,480
I don't even think he was hiding it at one point.

469
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,240
In one of his videos, he was quoted saying

470
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:36,360
Hey there, I haven't made a video on Eugenia Cooney's weight in months.

471
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,520
My videos on Eugenia Cooney always do very well.

472
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,440
So as a person who's concerned about Eugenia's health,

473
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,360
and a person who wants to make successful videos,

474
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,680
I'd like to take the opportunity to publicly check up on her now.

475
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,880
Really? What's wrong, Greg?

476
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,720
Onision Judge is not hitting like it used to?

477
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:50,040
Probably the most pivotal piece of evidence is when

478
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:53,640
YouTube mass demonetized videos about Eugenia Cooney,

479
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:58,520
and then Onision re-uploaded a video to another channel of his titled

480
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:01,080
Please Help This YouTuber Heal.

481
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,120
Not doing this for money.

482
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,360
Many more Eugenia re-uploads later.

483
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:07,400
She announces on Twitter that she is taking a break from social media

484
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,320
and privately working with a doctor.

485
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,160
Please respect that.

486
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,200
You guys saved Eugenia.

487
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,880
I may know who saved Eugenia.

488
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,680
It wasn't me.

489
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:19,240
How Eugenia Cooney will look after recovery.

490
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,840
Those are some things I need to say.

491
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:23,240
If you have anything positive you would like to say to Eugenia Cooney,

492
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:26,360
please post it to the page where she can go to see nothing but supportive

493
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,560
slash loving statements.

494
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,080
Thanks to you and the awesome mods.

495
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,560
I'm happy we're making a safe place for her and others.

496
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:34,280
Yeah guys, please go tell Eugenia that you support her

497
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,880
on my website's forums that have banner ads.

498
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:38,600
It's to help her.

499
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,160
Trust me.

500
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,840
As usual, the rumors are not true.

501
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:43,320
I am not making videos on Eugenia Cooney for money.

502
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,720
This is an important topic that needs to be discussed.

503
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:48,520
I have a Patreon to help me when my videos do not get monetized.

504
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,720
I truly do care about her.

505
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,320
As usual, I come with proof.

506
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:57,320
His proof is a screenshot of only four videos out of this 60 he made

507
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:59,000
that were dinged for demonetization.

508
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,840
Here's seven reasons why this tweet is horrible.

509
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:04,040
The number one thing you need to give an eating disorder is attention.

510
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:06,440
Not making videos on Eugenia for money

511
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:10,600
and not making money on Eugenia videos are two very different things, Greg.

512
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,520
I've made a lot of videos about Eugenia Cooney.

513
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,760
It seems you requested a review for one of your videos,

514
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:17,880
and the only reason you would do that is in the attempt to monetize it.

515
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,480
You just outed me yourself.

516
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:22,040
It's very possible after you tweet this,

517
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:26,040
you put in a review for the rest of the videos and maybe get them all monetized.

518
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,400
Your argument is decimated.

519
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:30,440
I have a Patreon to help me when my videos do not get monetized.

520
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,280
Did you guys know I have a Patreon?

521
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,960
Well, I mean, not anymore.

522
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,480
Do I want your attention?

523
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,760
Why even bring up Patreon?

524
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,200
That hurts your claim, if anything.

525
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,960
Guys, I'm not making these videos for money.

526
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,000
I get my money from Patreon, so it doesn't matter.

527
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,280
Being stupid means you lack intelligence or common sense.

528
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:50,280
I might be mistaken on this one, but you should have a more recent video up

529
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,760
that's not in this screenshot for some reason.

530
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:55,000
You just put it out there even more.

531
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,760
Just a week after this tweet, Onision listed 21 of his Eugenia videos

532
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,920
because he didn't want his more negative videos.

533
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:04,360
Still hanging over Eugenia's head as she dealt with her disorder privately.

534
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:07,080
At least that's what I would have said if Greg wasn't a scummy hypocrite.

535
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:10,600
He placed those 21 videos behind a paywall on his Patreon.

536
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,880
Not doing this for the money.

537
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,400
It's extremely gross at this point.

538
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:18,760
Greg is literally taunting her with these re-uploads and these money-grubbing shenanigans.

539
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:19,400
Don't worry, guys.

540
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:23,240
He took them off his Patreon a month later after he already took everybody's money.

541
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:26,040
After everybody went in there, took the videos and downloaded them.

542
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:26,920
And he knows that.

543
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,600
He knows that wasn't going to last long.

544
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,960
He wanted the quick buck.

545
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:34,200
This saga ends with videos like Eugenia Cooney's beautiful emails to me,

546
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,800
where he basically emailed her saying,

547
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,080
I wish the best for you.

548
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,760
Sorry about those jokes in the past.

549
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,280
All 600 of them.

550
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:44,920
Sorry about accusing you of quite literally murdering kids because of your disorder.

551
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:45,960
Dick move on my part.

552
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:49,640
And Eugenia, being the nicest person alive, replies saying,

553
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:53,400
Yeah, you should have really approached all of that differently, but thank you.

554
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,480
And Greg cashes in two videos off of that.

555
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,400
Did you just want more content, Greg?

556
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,080
Or do you actually care now?

557
00:29:59,080 --> 00:29:59,880
We may never know.

558
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:05,320
But what we do know is that the majority of Onision's Eugenia vids were made pre-adpocalypse.

559
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:11,080
So he has made, I would assume, tens of thousands of dollars off of her situation.

560
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:14,760
That is excluding the subscriber jumps that he most likely received from those videos,

561
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,840
which then trickled views into his other videos,

562
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:19,960
trickling money into his Patreon, trickling money into his merch.

563
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:23,800
If Onision making 60 plus videos on Eugenia Cooney was not for money,

564
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:27,480
then I guess the down payment on a mansion was just an unfortunate byproduct.

565
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:30,760
Those videos that were made intended to help Eugenia Cooney

566
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:33,000
get to rehab and start to rehabilitate.

567
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,640
Eugenia Cooney has since gone to rehabilitation and is rehabilitating.

568
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:43,240
Correlation does not imply causation, but whatever helps you sleep at night, Greg.

569
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,840
Thank you, Mr. GG.

570
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:45,480
What a G.

571
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:58,680
So here we have a man who picks fights with half the YouTube community.

572
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:02,600
Some of the most popular creators, including many of his former friends are Onision,

573
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:05,080
not Mr. GG though, he might do too.

574
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:10,440
Onision is provocative, offensive, unpleasant, and all around completely contradictory.

575
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:14,520
You'd have a hard time pinpointing where his principles and beliefs often lie,

576
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:17,240
owing the most loyal of fans would support him.

577
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:20,440
But maybe that's the point, and I will elaborate.

578
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:26,600
Many moons ago, I found myself for the first and only time stumbling across an Onision Speaks video.

579
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:30,920
I can't really remember too much about it, but it was regarding some social rights,

580
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:33,240
and on the whole, I remember agreeing with it.

581
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:36,120
It seemed like a sincere appeal to humanity.

582
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:40,360
Now, I didn't know much about him back then, but there are sprinkles of videos,

583
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:44,440
given the volume of them, that will typically appeal to an audience.

584
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:47,480
Onision embedded himself with certain behavioral characteristics

585
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:49,960
which were tailored towards people who may be vulnerable.

586
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:53,880
I'd identify four techniques that were very specific to what he created.

587
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:56,600
Firstly, his nature speak directly to the view often.

588
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,840
It allowed him to craft narratives that felt personal.

589
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:01,640
It felt like he was speaking to you a lot of the time.

590
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,240
That can be really endearing.

591
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,480
You can still walk.

592
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,760
You can still move your arms.

593
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:07,720
You can still talk.

594
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,240
You're very capable.

595
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,520
You're emotionally damaged.

596
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,000
So what?

597
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:11,720
I am too.

598
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:14,040
But that doesn't mean we just end it.

599
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,400
That doesn't mean we just quit.

600
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:17,880
There's hope for you.

601
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:21,480
This allowed him to create a more personal connection with the viewers he resonated with,

602
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:24,440
especially in environments where people may not have felt cared about.

603
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:27,480
Just having someone talking to you like that can really make a difference.

604
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:31,960
Secondly, his nature used a lot of language that one might class as compassionate,

605
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:34,040
with a framing that may feel more rational.

606
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:38,120
It appeals to people's emotions while giving them a security in the reasoning that he presents.

607
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:40,120
I'm not saying this is a bad way of arguing.

608
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:42,920
We can appeal to principles of morality a lot of the time through this,

609
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:45,960
but it will definitely attract a certain type of audience.

610
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:49,880
Because the relationship situation you find yourself in later on in life

611
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:53,480
does not necessarily define your fucking sexuality,

612
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:57,800
as sexuality doesn't necessarily have a whole lot to do with appearances.

613
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,520
You're acting like just because I don't own a fucking castle,

614
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,600
I'm not interested in owning a castle.

615
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:05,880
Just because somebody isn't with a beautiful man or a beautiful woman

616
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:09,480
doesn't mean they don't want to be with one or the other or both at the same time.

617
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:11,400
Thirdly, he would appeal to an authority.

618
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,440
Which authority?

619
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,920
Well, himself, his experiences, his life.

620
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:17,080
This would embolden him in the audience's mind.

621
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,720
Now, we all appeal to our experiences from time to time,

622
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:23,960
but he often did it in a very personal, revealing way, and he did it very often.

623
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:27,560
The best I can tell you is to use your best judgment.

624
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:31,960
When I deal with people who have cheat, I tend to disassociate myself with them

625
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:37,800
because they don't really have any reason to have done it beyond their own perversions.

626
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,960
So please decide for yourself what is best.

627
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,440
And don't do what I've done in the past,

628
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:47,080
where you forgive them for cheating.

629
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:50,440
Finally, he wasn't perfect, but he knew it,

630
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,760
and he knew his audience wasn't perfect either.

631
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:55,160
He'd appeal to the beauty in the imperfection,

632
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:57,240
being the outcast, the other people.

633
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,680
He was your voice.

634
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:01,960
Are the values of others so important that whenever you look in the mirror,

635
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,720
all you see is what they tell you you are?

636
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:06,280
Is the person you wish to be truly someone else?

637
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:10,200
You want to decide your actions based on what you think others will think of you?

638
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,600
Or would you rather live your life the way that you want to?

639
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,440
When you discover who you truly are,

640
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:17,160
when you finally decide to take on your dream,

641
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:20,600
to live by what harms no one, what feels right to you,

642
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:24,520
the ridicule and mockery you get from others becomes irrelevant.

643
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:28,520
Once you have found who you are, once you discover the truth within yourself,

644
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:31,560
no lies or corrupt persuasion can change who you are.

645
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,880
They can't change who you wish to be.

646
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:38,040
He could be confrontational, but he also could be sincere, soft, well-spoken.

647
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,400
But his messages were clear.

648
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,920
He wanted you to be stronger.

649
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:41,640
He'd been there.

650
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:45,080
He had been to the darkest places in the world and came out on top.

651
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:47,160
His imperfections were your imperfections.

652
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:50,920
He was as tortured as you, but you didn't have to let that hold you back.

653
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:54,680
An idol is meant to be someone we can aspire to, but also someone we relate to,

654
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:59,320
and Onision was crafting himself as the idol to the vulnerable, broken youth.

655
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:03,560
He'd have all these opinions, but then he'd have this deep fleshed out backstory.

656
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:06,600
He was this walking character study slash sitcom

657
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:11,320
who would derive a lot of his opinions from his very serious experiences.

658
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:15,160
But because of all his contradictory, destructive, hurtful behaviour,

659
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:19,000
you'd have to lack some capacity and critical thinking to give him a pass,

660
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,440
and yet some people did.

661
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:23,480
In fact, in spite of this, he had a lot of devoted super fans,

662
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,480
which is probably what he wanted.

663
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:29,720
One of the tones that he has conveyed is a consistent distrust in authority,

664
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,800
even those who might be qualified.

665
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:35,800
And let me let you in on a secret, or at least a personal observation that I'm making.

666
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,720
He wants to be the authority.

667
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:41,560
Before Onision's YouTube venture, hopefully mentioned by a good friend earlier,

668
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,400
he ran a site called Sesesca.

669
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:47,560
I think this represents eventually what Onision wanted his channel to be.

670
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:51,080
Sesesca was a religion that Greg started when he was 17,

671
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:54,920
although he stated he had subscribed to the doctrine since he was 11.

672
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,520
I personally find that unlikely,

673
00:35:56,520 --> 00:36:01,480
but hey ho, I think deciding the truth on such a statement would be a bit of a tangent.

674
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:05,080
Sesesca as a concept had all these bizarre ideas

675
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:08,280
that one might expect from a new start-up religion.

676
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:11,480
Onision would regularly spend time in forums promoting the religion,

677
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:15,400
sometimes acting as a follower, sometimes acting as a founder,

678
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,160
maybe he was testing a response,

679
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:20,680
or maybe he was just doing what he felt was the most socially beneficial.

680
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:25,000
He also posted some emails he thought were of value from the site,

681
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,440
including ones where he credits his sociopathic traits

682
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:31,400
as giving him some form of god-like qualities.

683
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,760
How very inspiring.

684
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:35,880
There are many other highlights, but you can see it for yourself.

685
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,800
In a way, it makes him a monster.

686
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:41,080
In a way, it makes him a god.

687
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:44,120
Now we may laugh at things like this,

688
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,880
but the truth is that all over the world,

689
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:50,680
cults like this are formed under the belief that the person at the helm is some sort of god.

690
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:51,960
Onision knew that,

691
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:56,200
and therefore tried to replicate the formula to create a cyber cult of sorts.

692
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:59,960
Abuse of power within cults is often solicited when a person is roped in

693
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:05,240
by an individual's charisma or sincerity or extensive wealth or any other values like that,

694
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:09,240
but once they're in and once they have become indoctrinated with this belief system,

695
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:14,200
they become often dependent on the cult leader, often financially and emotionally.

696
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:17,080
This allows people in power to exploit that control.

697
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:19,480
Creating a cult online has a few downsides,

698
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:22,040
one of the biggest issues is physical proximity.

699
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:27,000
When you're trying to escape a cult, it's not just mental entrapment, but physical.

700
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,400
Even if it's not exactly a prison, the feeling that you may be chased or face a consequence,

701
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:34,360
even worse if you get caught, is scary.

702
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:38,040
If a cult leader has shown themselves to be capable of exploitation,

703
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:40,680
who knows what lengths they'll go to maintain that.

704
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:43,800
Obviously, although someone is not powerless over the internet,

705
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:47,720
the window between people often gives them more control to make decisions

706
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:51,160
that may help them distance themselves from controlling individuals.

707
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:56,280
On top of this, it's hard to channel assets like charisma and sincerity into text form,

708
00:37:56,280 --> 00:38:00,520
so it made sense that actually Onision's YouTube channel worked better as a medium.

709
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:03,000
To all you pro-lifers, I have a question.

710
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:10,920
How many times do you need to be raped and impregnated before you figure out

711
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,040
that having a choice

712
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,880
may be a little bit more important than you originally thought?

713
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,800
When you originally look on his channel,

714
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,520
maybe you're met with one of the less atrocious takes,

715
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:27,480
maybe you're met with something you feel passionately about,

716
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:31,800
maybe you're in need of help and you're looking for a philosophy to latch onto.

717
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:36,840
Onision isn't incredible, but he can communicate those feelings to a competent degree,

718
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:39,640
and every now and then he'll say something that will resonate.

719
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:43,480
Onision would talk about his personal life, his background, his time in the army,

720
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:46,520
the time he almost took his own life, it's all very personal.

721
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:50,040
He would talk about these experiences as if they weathered him in a way,

722
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:52,040
and gave him some found wisdom.

723
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:57,400
In my mind, the moment that gun was to my head, I stopped being afraid.

724
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,440
I stopped caring.

725
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,680
I've changed as a person since that day.

726
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,760
Because now I feel like no matter what happens to me,

727
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:16,760
I made it way further than I should have.

728
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:20,920
The thing is, although I said there was no discernible explanation for his behavior,

729
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:24,760
many people have created theories over the years, including Greg himself.

730
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:29,560
For example, one situation where he diagnosed himself with Borderline Personality Disorder

731
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:35,000
to explain his volatile moods in videos regarding a relationship with another person named Adrian.

732
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,280
This explanation was actually initiated by one of Greg's viewers,

733
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:41,640
and this led to a saga itself where he discussed it in a video.

734
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Hi, I just found out something great from an Onision.net member.

735
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,160
I have Borderline Personality Disorder.

736
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,120
So now we know the problem.

737
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:56,040
Although he would denounce this four years later in another video claiming to be ignorant,

738
00:39:56,040 --> 00:40:00,600
it definitely represents these sort of fleeting explanations that many of his audience grapple at

739
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:05,320
to justify and understand his behavior, and maybe even explain it themselves.

740
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:09,640
In that situation, many more critical viewers have believed he was attempting to manipulate

741
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:12,520
Adrian back into a relationship with his videos,

742
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:16,680
before then scapegoating mental illness to avoid accountability for his behavior.

743
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:20,760
But hey, at least he had that elaborate backstory in trouble and pain

744
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:24,600
that reeled in so many people who felt like they knew him.

745
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:27,480
Ladies and gentlemen, they really didn't.

746
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:33,000
As mentioned, it was a guise so people would feel some sort of semblance of sympathy

747
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,960
for all the terrible things he did over the few years.

748
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:41,320
So before we go any further, I suggest we document the lies of Onision.

749
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:44,280
But to do that, I brought my friend once again, Jay Aubrey.

750
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,200
Take it away, my friend.

751
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:55,160
It's been a good few months since I've gotten to speak my shit,

752
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:58,360
but it seems Greg is just the gift that keeps on giving.

753
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:02,920
What better way to ring in the new year than by revisiting our good pal, right?

754
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,920
Looks like it's time for round two.

755
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:11,800
When James asked me to cover the many lies of Onision, I really didn't think it was possible.

756
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:14,920
I mean, with an online footprint as monumental as Greg's,

757
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:19,160
keeping track of every intricate fable he's spun over the past decade

758
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:21,640
is like stapling jello to a tree.

759
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:27,000
But his rampant dishonesty does go on to further illustrate the type of creature we're dealing with.

760
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,160
And with a timeline as clunky as this one,

761
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:33,880
I suppose it's only right we try and keep everything as concise as humanly possible.

762
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,960
Why don't we start at the beginning?

763
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:41,720
I was brainwashed since a child to think that America was just the greatest place on earth

764
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:45,720
and the Air Force is not full of nothing but elites, OK?

765
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:49,400
Now, before I continue, I want you guys to know none of this is confidential information.

766
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:52,280
OK, there are movies about how corrupt the military is.

767
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,880
It's not new news.

768
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:58,760
For years, Onision has used his veteran status to glorify his own image

769
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:01,880
while simultaneously criticizing the U.S. military.

770
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:04,840
According to Greg, he signed up for the United States Air Force

771
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:08,600
when he was 19 years old in January 2005,

772
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:11,480
not graduating boot camp until May of that year.

773
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:14,040
He joined SCRE school the following day,

774
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:17,160
but immediately dropped out after refusing to kill a rabbit

775
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:21,320
before moving to San Antonio, Texas, to begin special training in August.

776
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:26,040
He was finally deployed to South Korea before his honorable discharge in 2008,

777
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:29,640
only it wasn't as honorable as he'd like it to be.

778
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:30,280
Hey there.

779
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:36,200
So as of late, there's been a bit of debate over what my discharge was from the U.S. Air Force.

780
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:37,880
Somebody posted this to Twitter.

781
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:40,040
I thought that was interesting that someone actually went digging

782
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:42,920
to find out whatever documents are out there.

783
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:45,960
See, Greg has tried to get discharged a couple of times.

784
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:48,840
Apart from regularly uploading videos in uniform,

785
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:52,200
he also tried to convince medical professionals he was depressed,

786
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,760
along with stripping naked in his sergeant's office

787
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:57,880
to prove he was human and, quote, not a robot.

788
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:01,640
He got thrown in a cell and received an Article 15 for that little episode.

789
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:04,280
Probably wouldn't warrant an honorable discharge, for sure.

790
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:07,240
But Greg was adamant about this and proved his nobility

791
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:10,200
by showing off some documents as evidence in a video.

792
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:14,360
Sure enough, honorable was checked off, so everything seemed to add up.

793
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:20,280
At least until 2017, when it became public knowledge that he received a general discharge.

794
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:22,600
You guys imply that I wasn't discharged how I said I was.

795
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,600
I wasn't discharged honorably in any way.

796
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:28,920
And then you release a document that says I was discharged how I was described

797
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:30,920
and that I was discharged under honorable conditions.

798
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:32,120
And you know what? That's fine.

799
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:35,000
If I was discharged generally under honorable conditions,

800
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
that is still literally honorable.

801
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,680
By the title, it says honorable.

802
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:42,040
Receiving a general discharge under honorable conditions

803
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:44,520
is not the same as an honorable discharge.

804
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:46,200
But you know that and you still don't care.

805
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:50,600
With a discrepancy this minute, is there anything you won't lie about?

806
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:56,360
I started a religion when I was 17 called Seska.

807
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:57,560
Thank you for doing that, Dubbs.

808
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:01,400
I started a religion when I was 17 called Seska.

809
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:06,040
You know, if I had to guess, if I want to play this little religious game,

810
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:10,360
I would go with the following theories that I'm going to express over the next few days.

811
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:15,240
Since the young age of 11, Greg has denounced the teachings of the Christian church,

812
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:20,680
turning away from the Bible and embracing a unique belief system of his own, dubbed Seska.

813
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:26,120
But after being exposed for trying to turn it into a religion in 2006,

814
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:28,920
Greg denied his affiliation with the ideology,

815
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:32,680
deleting the website in a frivolous attempt to sweep the incident under the rug.

816
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:35,720
Though unfortunately for you, Greg, you can't hide from me.

817
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:40,120
According to the archived site, the lore behind Seska goes as follows.

818
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:44,680
The earth creates all energy, humans come from the earth, humans are to protect the earth,

819
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:47,720
and our bodies are used as shells to feed our spirits.

820
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:52,840
Yeah, that's a rare glimpse into the mind of an 11 year old onion right there.

821
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:58,600
The website originally stated that Seska found its way into millions of homes across the globe,

822
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:01,480
until Greg later bumped that number down to thousands.

823
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:04,760
Both, we can assume, were gross over-exaggerations meant to feed

824
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:07,400
an already inflated sense of self-importance.

825
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:12,360
Greg's religion would never meet its full potential, not only due to its insane principles,

826
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:16,520
but also his ridiculously ego-driven attempts at recruitment.

827
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:21,720
Outlined quite vividly in a 2005 email, where he depicts himself as a sociopathic,

828
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:24,840
god-like figure in search of a loyal following.

829
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:30,360
Seska would make a reappearance, however, under the religion tab of the Onision website in 2008,

830
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:40,200
writing,

831
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:55,880
Though this description barely lasted a year, disappearing from the website again before 2009.

832
00:45:55,880 --> 00:46:00,680
It was later revealed through public court records that Greg had filed to have his name

833
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:05,160
legally changed to Seska at one point, perfectly demonstrating his mental

834
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:09,800
follies and further illustrating the man's twisted perception of himself.

835
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:12,920
A god whose omnipotence knows no bounds.

836
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:21,000
Though in 2013 his mastery was challenged after being called out for another infamous

837
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,960
controversy widely known as Turtle Gate.

838
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:27,800
I just looked up tortoise, uh, what exact kind of tortoise I have.

839
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:31,160
It's a Russian tortoise, not a desert tortoise, but guess what that means?

840
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:35,240
It means that the basking temperature of a tortoise that I had, look it up,

841
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:38,280
look up Russian tortoise, and you'll see a turtle that looked just like the,

842
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:40,920
the tortoise I had, sorry, I just keep saying turtle, it's just easy.

843
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:44,360
Anyway, Greg announced on Instagram the death of his Russian tortoise,

844
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:48,920
Reptar, with a photo of a plastic bin laying upside down in his backyard.

845
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:53,880
According to Greg, Reptar's death was not the result of heat or a lack of oxygen,

846
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:57,800
but rather a panic attack likely induced by noisy neighbors,

847
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:02,760
claiming it could not have overheated because he bought the tortoise under a heat lamp,

848
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:06,360
disputing any claims of ignorance by playing victim and labeling his

849
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:10,120
critics as hypocrites since most of them probably eat meat anyway.

850
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:15,480
You guys owe me a fucking apology, you do, all y'all, all y'all smurfs,

851
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:20,120
you don't even deserve names, you're just smurfs, okay, you smurfs, you owe me,

852
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:25,080
you owe Onision an apology, I did not kill my tortoise, you want to know why?

853
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:32,280
Because basking temperature for a tortoise is 95 motherfucking degrees, look it up motherfucker.

854
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:36,760
But in case you think his consistent incompetence is anything other than purposeful,

855
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:39,240
maybe you haven't heard about the wetlands.

856
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:44,360
See, Onision's property in Washington is actually sitting on some pretty sizable wetlands,

857
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:48,760
only he isn't allowed to do much with them, the law specifically prohibits him from damaging any

858
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:53,400
of the land surrounding these bodies of water, which is why questions began to arise after his

859
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:58,440
neighbors shot some footage of what looked like our friend doing just that. This wasn't confirmed,

860
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:03,480
of course, until Greg literally filmed himself cutting down trees in his backyard after being

861
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:08,360
explicitly told to stop, landing himself in some deep trouble with the law.

862
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:13,160
And if you talk to your neighbors and the housing organization, then guess what,

863
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:17,400
you wouldn't have gotten any fees and you would have been perfectly fine, they would have said,

864
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:25,000
yes, clear these out, it is totally okay, but no, what you did was ignore the county coming to you

865
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:29,640
and telling you that you can't do it, and then you rented a fucking bobcat and you're on video

866
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:34,680
doing it, that's what they showed in court, literally a clip of you and a bobcat mowing

867
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:38,840
down a tree. Seeing as the man isn't exactly the upstanding citizen he may claim to be,

868
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:43,640
he later emphasized that he did nothing wrong during his process of, you know, breaking the

869
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:47,960
law, but I guess it's all well and good because he still forces audience to pay for it, so I can't,

870
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:52,520
what else is new? Long story short, to all my haters, I know you're useless, irrelevant,

871
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:57,160
and wish you could be my boyfriend, but you can't, and I know that's why you hate me,

872
00:48:57,160 --> 00:49:00,840
so instead of flucking me, you'll just have to settle with my parting advice,

873
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:08,120
you should fuck yourself, you should fuck yourself, you can't fuck me, so go fuck yourself,

874
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:15,240
I am a god and you are peasant scum, so get a broomstick and fuck your own bum.

875
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:19,480
Onision may not be the brightest crayon in the box when it comes to wetlands,

876
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:24,120
but he sure could teach a master class in manipulation, there's not one thing that

877
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:28,760
falls out of this cretin's mouth that you can take at face value, with his rampant

878
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:33,960
deceit dating back literal decades, I'd sooner trust James to pay me, and we all know that's a

879
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:40,120
stretch, but as one of YouTube's most prolific and notorious sociopaths, it'd be ridiculous of

880
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:46,440
us to expect anything less than unbridled deception and overt immorality. Uh, I didn't

881
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:52,440
bake my turtle, okay? That just was not, it's not possible to be hot enough, unless of course,

882
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:57,480
putting him in a plastic tub outside, a large plastic tub that has air coming into it,

883
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:02,840
and it has air coming into it, and if he wanted out, he could just dig, you know, because he's in,

884
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:08,440
he's in dirt and, and grass, he could just, because they're digging turtles, those turtles dig.

885
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:11,960
Anyway, oh, you didn't know that about the turtle either? You didn't know he's a digging turtle?

886
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:16,120
You guys don't, you need to do your research, to, to quote you, you need to do your research.

887
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:18,360
I was fucking right and you were fucking wrong, huh?

888
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:24,200
You probably still think you're a good person deep down there somewhere.

889
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:26,280
Idiots don't escape anything but reality.

890
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:32,040
There's a phrase that money does not buy happiness.

891
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:35,480
The thing is, with all these lies accounted for to many people,

892
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:40,600
they weren't lies, even if there was evidence to prove otherwise, that's the point of a cult,

893
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:45,400
people leave their reasoning at the door, and once he had that grip over a dedicated fan base,

894
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:51,320
he could move in and take what he needed. Onision is like one of those badly worded spam emails,

895
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:56,120
but in this instance, it's badly worded by design, so that only people who can't notice

896
00:50:56,120 --> 00:51:01,320
its insidious nature will be interested enough to fall for it, and once they've taken the bait,

897
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:04,520
Onision moves in, like a crocodile.

898
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:11,480
This can be observed over a number of methods.

899
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:14,920
The first one, of course, is using his power to ask fans for favors.

900
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:19,800
One of the most common in this regard, especially in the YouTube regard, is money.

901
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:24,200
Now, I don't know how much money Onision has made, but he has three channels that

902
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:29,240
have all approximately amassed 2 million subscribers each with a lot of views.

903
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:34,520
Until very recently, he had a Patreon, he has his own website with ads, he sells books,

904
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:40,120
songs, even an album. Now, I highly doubt that too much of his YouTube content is now monetized,

905
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:43,720
and to be frank, for good reason, however, in a less sensorious time,

906
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:45,960
I'm sure he was making more than enough.

907
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:49,720
This is a guy who uploaded a lot, and I mean a lot.

908
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:54,200
If you consider that at the peak he was uploading onto all three of his channels,

909
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:58,360
in very short time periods, this was something he was heavily committed to,

910
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:01,240
and then you have to count all the videos he's deleted as well.

911
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:06,600
So it may come as a shock to many, when in 2017, Onision announced that actually,

912
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:08,840
he was in a serious amount of debt.

913
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:13,240
Onision's initial response, like all creators under stress, was to place his main channel

914
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:17,640
behind a paywall. After this was met with annoyance from many fans, he once again flipped

915
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:22,120
making an angry video telling people that their reluctance to support such content was because

916
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:27,480
he was worthless to them, a classic guilt trip. He goes off on this massive diatribe about people

917
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:31,240
stifling his dreams, he has truly lost his marbles.

918
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:36,040
And what I've gotten from all this is, not only am I not worth 49 cents to a lot of you guys,

919
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:40,360
but I never really had a real connection with a lot of you.

920
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:45,640
It was always about you getting something out of watching me,

921
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:50,600
and never about actually having a real bond with the person you're watching.

922
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:57,240
It's frustrating that there's such a huge amount of entitlement on this site, and no realization

923
00:52:57,240 --> 00:53:02,200
or recognition for the person who's actually behind the camera, who's actually trying to

924
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:06,280
follow their dreams, rather than just fall in line with everyone else.

925
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:13,560
So when you look at the monetary aspect of $5.50 a year, or the 49 cents a month, it's not just

926
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:18,680
money. This is you establishing that you're different than everyone else and that you can

927
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:23,160
shell out half, is it a third of the candy bar? Is that a third of a candy bar that you'd be

928
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:29,400
shelling out? That you could shell out that small fraction just to actually help somebody you care

929
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:35,240
about, who you say you care about, survive the huge financial wall that's about to crush them.

930
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:39,240
Obviously, this was a terrible way to respond, and people quickly picked up on that,

931
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:42,760
and he had to change his tune, so he came back a month later,

932
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:47,160
singing a different key, and explaining the situation in a bit more depth.

933
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:51,480
Hey guys, I talked to the IRS today, and representative of taxaudit.com,

934
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:58,600
and I got some really bad news, and the bad news is that there's certain tax laws that

935
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:07,880
I did not know about, and one of these tax laws is telling you that you cannot deduct

936
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:14,440
more than 1.29th of a business property acquisition each year.

937
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:18,920
Now, initially, I didn't see anything threatening about this video. He opens up about his issue,

938
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:23,080
takes responsibility, and appears to just be asked to be able to support if they can,

939
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:27,960
which if he genuinely needed money, he could ask, and although I think anyone would be

940
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:31,400
justified in telling him that this is his fault and he doesn't need any more money,

941
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:36,120
if you actively enjoyed his content, then who am I to tell you what not to support?

942
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:37,800
In that moment, at least.

943
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:48,840
This is my screw-up. I screwed up hard. I wasn't educated on these taxes, and I used TurboTax,

944
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:54,520
and I hoped that they would educate me on those, but TurboTax didn't have a pop-up dialogue that

945
00:54:54,520 --> 00:55:02,040
said, hey, when you claim this property, you can only do 1.29th of it. Never got a pop-up dialogue

946
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:12,200
saying that, so it's a tough one. I do have a Patreon, patreon.com slash onision. You guys

947
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:17,640
are keeping me going, especially now that we know I have at least $150,000 in debt.

948
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:21,960
However, not too long after, he decides to go off on another diatribe blaming an app called

949
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:26,520
TurboTax for telling him that it was unlikely he'd be audited before complaining about the

950
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:28,760
society he does indeed live in.

951
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:33,480
As for chances of me getting audited every single year, it was in the green.

952
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:40,280
TurboTax told me that it was a very low chance of me getting audited, so never trusting TurboTax again,

953
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:47,960
and surviving this is going to be rough, it's going to be heartbreaking, but this is the country we live in,

954
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:50,680
and this is the government we're dealing with.

955
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:55,960
Honestly, although I accept people can criticise the system while accepting personal responsibility,

956
00:55:55,960 --> 00:56:01,480
it's a necessary part of providing perspective, I just find his tone and structure rather unsettling.

957
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:05,800
It gives me the impression that he's attempting to manipulate an audience into having the perception

958
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:11,640
that on one hand, he's remorseful, and yet it's over something that's not his fault, it's society's.

959
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:16,040
It's like he's trying to manipulate people into thinking he's wrongfully remorseful, and that he should

960
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:22,440
He also released this weird video on his main channel, which seemed semi-ironic, but then had

961
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:28,520
these very unironic statements directed at some of his exes, which I think confused the audience as much as me.

962
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:36,600
I'm now making, you know, what normal people make, and I basically am feeling suicidal because of that.

963
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:41,720
I recently went through a breakup, I dumped somebody, and they didn't worship me after, I don't know why.

964
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:48,280
I think I have an STD, I didn't cheat on Lainey, I just somehow got an STD, even though Lainey doesn't have STDs.

965
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:55,080
Still paying alimony, literally, that sucks. We divorced like six years ago, but you know,

966
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:58,680
f*** me, right? My riding lawnmower's broken, donate today.

967
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:03,560
Now, though that's my opinion on that set of videos, I'm willing to provide benefit of the doubt to a

968
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:09,560
degree that people respond to distressing situations in an often irrational way. However, Onision wasn't

969
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:14,840
finished with his crusade, and another situation which demonstrated this more clearly came into

970
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:20,040
clutch, this relating to Onision's wetlands. Onision moved into another house in the last year,

971
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:24,600
and decided that he wanted to clean out some unwanted content from these wetlands. Now, the

972
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:30,600
wetlands were a protected area, so Onision was not allowed to make too many changes to the surrounding

973
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:35,240
environment. In a legal document, it's reported that Onision wanted to clear the area for the

974
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:39,720
purpose of having a clean view of the lake, but even after being warned, he persisted, and

975
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:42,360
eventually concerned neighbors caught him on video.

976
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:45,320
Onision's Dad So, category two wetland.

977
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:51,400
There's a hundred foot buffer from the edge of the wetland for development.

978
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:59,240
Need a permit at the very least, and mitigation for clearing.

979
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:04,840
Now, there is no doubt after watching this that Onision acted recklessly, and has full

980
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:09,880
responsibility. The documents show he had been warned at point of penalty, and he persisted.

981
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:14,760
What exactly was the outcome? Well, we can't exactly be sure. We know that fines of up to

982
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:19,800
$10,000 were threatened. However, in the final legal settlement, we do know that Onision was

983
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:25,640
requested to replant all the damaged and removed items. So, after being called out by many people,

984
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:30,200
clearly annoyed at his behavior, what does he do? Well, he obviously misframes the situation for a

985
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:35,400
bit, but then in response to all this criticism, he starts a GoFundMe.

986
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:17,800
Onision's Dad This GoFundMe also received pretty immediate

987
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:22,680
backlash, and then in response, Onision turned into a bait and switch, claiming that he was

988
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:26,520
baiting people into showing that they didn't actually care about the environment because

989
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:30,600
they weren't actually concerned about his wetlands, and they didn't want to give him

990
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:36,600
money to show them that they wanted it replanted. That is some A-Star grade logic there.

991
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:41,240
Onision I didn't think anyone would donate. I was actually doing that whole thing just to make a

992
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:45,880
point, and my point was kind of destroyed when some people started donating, so...

993
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:51,640
I did get the joke, but I also feel the methodology was flawed. If he started a GoFundMe to prove that

994
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:55,880
no one actually cared or could put their money where their mouth is, surely he'd have made it

995
00:59:55,880 --> 01:00:02,120
a more serious video to actually test people, and even then it fails as a concept. Anyone with

996
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:06,760
basic reasoning skills would say that donating to the untrustworthy man's crowdfunding project

997
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:11,400
to restore the garden that he destroyed would not be a good idea. Although masqueraded as a

998
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:17,480
vague point, it was once again a desperate attempt to raise money, because he does not like losing

999
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:22,680
it. He has more than enough money, no doubt about it, but he hates losing money, and around a similar

1000
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:27,160
time, it appeared he also started another GoFundMe which was for a new Onision forum,

1001
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:33,320
but that one is long gone. It's like a broken record running round, and round, and round.

1002
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:39,720
The real campaign is a message board. I have a message board that I want to fund. I really love

1003
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:45,160
forums and so forth, and I want to fund that. Onision doesn't want money because he needs it.

1004
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:51,240
Onision wants money as a statement of power, and he wants to see how loyal people are to him. He

1005
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:57,960
never wants to lose. It's a test of who really cares about him, not the wetlands. Onision has,

1006
01:00:57,960 --> 01:01:02,920
and have, multiple videos up where he has lamented the little money he makes, and yet continues to

1007
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:06,840
live a life of reasonable wealth. Onision- Despite all this, despite this overwhelming debt that I

1008
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:11,880
cannot pay, I don't see how I could, because I don't see how any bank is going to give me $450,000

1009
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:16,680
as a loan or anything. If he cared about money as much as he claims to, he wouldn't behave so

1010
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:21,480
recklessly, but like a child, it's all about how much he can get away with with the audience,

1011
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:26,440
and see how they will excuse it. It's a power trip to him, and he's flying first class with

1012
01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:31,160
a crowdfunded ticket, but this plane is about to take one deep dive.

1013
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:46,440
So Onision's pity party for favors is certainly part of how he plays with his audience's

1014
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:52,040
dependence on him. However, why would he stop there? There are multiple examples that have been

1015
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:57,000
documented in other people's videos for how he levies this control, but there are points that

1016
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:02,520
many have argued this is pushed into rather perverse territory. Onision is a person who

1017
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:07,560
doesn't hide much, and when I say that about Onision, I mean it in the most troublesome sense.

1018
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:12,600
When I was working on a video for Jay Aubrey covering the relationship history of Onision,

1019
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:17,240
I realised that he projected a fair amount of fetishes onto his own channel.

1020
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:22,360
Onision. I'm coming for you. Jay Aubrey. Come to me. Onision. Almost there.

1021
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:30,760
Jay Aubrey. Wait, what? Onision. That's right, baby. Your lips taste like cherry.

1022
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:35,720
Jay Aubrey. Oh my god, no. Onision. This feels so right without whiskers. No more

1023
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:41,240
sandpaper except down there. Mmm, girl. This one is from when he was having a weird

1024
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:45,640
three-way relationship with two people who we'll cover in the next video. In a way,

1025
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:52,040
this is presented as a funny comedy video, but it's not. It's a cuck fantasy, and this is just the

1026
01:02:52,040 --> 01:02:57,560
tip of the iceberg when we get down to it. There's a lot to talk about, but we'll start with the

1027
01:02:57,560 --> 01:03:03,400
tamer stuff, which isn't saying much. So Onision has a third channel, a commentary channel.

1028
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:09,080
Uh-oh, bro. Such a nice name. Not satisfied with two channels, he started this little project in

1029
01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:17,240
around 2012, centering around commentary. However, this channel was very strange. It posted on some

1030
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:23,400
instances very childish content, but also a lot less savory stuff. Now, obviously, we have the

1031
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:30,040
wonderful Onision forums, the wholesome oasis in the barren internet desert, and uh-oh, bro has a

1032
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:35,640
channel where people send him pictures of themselves, and he decides to rate them. This was also the same

1033
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:41,080
channel in which he took a test to find out if he was a pedo. Excellent optics, I must add.

1034
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:45,800
suggested I take a pedophile quiz, and I know a lot of you probably thought I would never take a pedophile

1035
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:51,160
quiz, but I think that idea is freaking hilarious, so I'm gonna do it. In fact, this channel is quite

1036
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:56,440
unpredictable in the tone, with many criticizing him for placing child-oriented content alongside

1037
01:03:56,440 --> 01:04:01,160
much more mature uploads. Now, if a person has a range of interests, then they are more than

1038
01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:05,800
welcome to express it, but I don't think those were his motives, so let's talk about this

1039
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:10,760
delightful rating system. In Onision's forum, he had a place where people could post pictures of

1040
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:17,080
themselves and ask to be rated. Now, I admittedly find the concept alone rather strange. I understand

1041
01:04:17,080 --> 01:04:23,160
why people send pictures to be roasted, or complimented maybe, but to be rated by Onision,

1042
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:29,320
well, strikes me as a bit off, and Onision has a habit of making everything strangely personal,

1043
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:50,680
as always. And even unsettling.

1044
01:04:59,320 --> 01:05:10,200
I'll add a minor caveat that those clips were from a video on his Onision Speaks channel,

1045
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:15,000
although he has done videos on both channels with similar tones, the comments from that video in

1046
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:20,120
particular were just a personal favourite. I mean, if you gave it a passing glance, you may not see

1047
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:25,480
anything dangerous about it on principle, it's just with the context of his other work considered,

1048
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:31,240
he probably shouldn't be rating people, and with the latest clip, he's made it 100% clear he has no

1049
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:37,000
issue if they're underage. I'll be honest, I'm not exactly sure what barometer he's rating these

1050
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:41,000
people on, I'm sure many of us have told other people they look good or they look nice as a good

1051
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:45,400
compliment, as a way to maybe encourage them or provide them with confidence, but the sort of

1052
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:51,960
dynamic he's operating is slightly strange. He's a large creator, he knows his power, he knows he's

1053
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:56,680
gonna have a load of young fangirls who want to appear in these videos because he's popular.

1054
01:05:57,240 --> 01:06:02,280
That was probably the major complaint relating to this content, this extended to individual cases,

1055
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:07,080
including a woman who claimed to be the sister of an 11 year old child who posted a picture in the

1056
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:11,800
forum to be rated. Onision states that he likes to keep his children off the internet due to

1057
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:17,000
these communities, and yet actively engages them when they're not his own. Despite knowing the risk

1058
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:21,640
and the amount of creeps online who would take advantage of this sort of content, I dislike the

1059
01:06:21,640 --> 01:06:26,440
whole dynamic, I think it's unhealthy, and I think given the context we're aware of, once again it

1060
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:31,800
was a power trip that Onision likes to feel control over his fan base, the idea that he can provide

1061
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:36,840
his personal approval to people and they can be recognised by him. I mean, of course Onision put

1062
01:06:36,840 --> 01:06:41,400
out a condescending response video where he stated that the fact that he placed disclaimer in the

1063
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:47,080
forum stating it was 18 plus was, of course, reasonable precautions. Excluding his other

1064
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:52,760
comments that make it look very flimsy, people were not buying it at all, and people didn't

1065
01:06:52,760 --> 01:06:58,360
think that Onision really had the protection of children at the centre of his heart.

1066
01:06:58,360 --> 01:07:02,040
Onision- First off, I want to establish that the forum specifically stated 18 plus only, so if you

1067
01:07:02,040 --> 01:07:06,360
submitted a photo and you're not 18 plus, you either weren't paying attention or you're a liar.

1068
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:13,240
Either way, shame on you. It's not just a simple thing, it's Onision taking what he can get, and as

1069
01:07:13,240 --> 01:07:17,720
we know from his history, he doesn't have many limits, and he has curated an audience who will

1070
01:07:17,720 --> 01:07:22,760
consent to him doing anything and supporting him through multiple controversies, and the fact that

1071
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:27,640
this sort of thing happened for years without anyone being able to take him down a notch was

1072
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:33,320
a testament to the commitment of many of his most dedicated audiences. Uh-oh bro seemed cultivated

1073
01:07:33,320 --> 01:07:37,480
towards reeling children in with seemingly childish videos and then involving them in his

1074
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:45,160
much more mature rating game, and other videos of the sorts. It was a trap. Onision's sexual desires,

1075
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:50,760
paired with the immaturity of his tone on many of his videos, is a concerning combination for many

1076
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:56,680
apparent. It was Spider-Man and Elsa, but more subtle. However, the notion of subtlety had worn

1077
01:07:56,680 --> 01:08:01,480
thin by 2019, as his Twitter became something else altogether.

1078
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:12,920
Hello everyone, my name is Fainted, and today the right opinion has kindly requested that I use my

1079
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:22,440
professional tweet reading skills to narrate some Onision tweets, and um, it's about to get pretty

1080
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:27,880
graphic. Just a warning. I don't care if you hate yourself after you masturbate to me, I just want

1081
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:34,600
you to be satisfied. Just woke up with an erection. Will you take care of it for me? We'll make you

1082
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:41,480
breakfast while you recover. Bro, give up on lesbians. They will never be into you. If they are,

1083
01:08:41,480 --> 01:08:48,280
they're not lesbians. I need more cute British accents in my life. Well, this may be the video

1084
01:08:48,280 --> 01:08:53,960
for you, my friend. We've got the right opinion. We got Fainted. What more could you want? I love the

1085
01:08:53,960 --> 01:08:59,720
look in your eyes when you realize my baby is growing inside you. You know, I'm kind of over

1086
01:08:59,720 --> 01:09:04,840
denying how incredible I am. Your screams of pleasure say it all. I wouldn't fuck you if I

1087
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:10,200
didn't think you were beautiful. I wouldn't come inside you if I didn't think it belonged in you.

1088
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:16,120
You were made to be fucked by me. Others may hate you, but they don't win unless you hate them.

1089
01:09:17,080 --> 01:09:22,760
In other news, wanna give me a blowjob? They say when you have sex with someone, a piece of them

1090
01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:28,840
follows you for life. I'm cool with that. Everyone has something beautiful about them. My best moments

1091
01:09:28,840 --> 01:09:34,920
are spent unloading inside of you. Oh wow, I really hope my parents weren't listening when I was

1092
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:39,720
recording that. The true colors were showing, and people were starting to pay much more attention to

1093
01:09:39,720 --> 01:09:46,360
his reckless behavior. But there was a lot of digging to do. Over the years, whether it was the

1094
01:09:46,360 --> 01:09:59,800
lies, contradiction, infidelity, animal abuse, many people stood by him. But even worse, people went to

1095
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:05,640
him. I wish we were near the end, but we are not. And that's why you should join me in part two,

1096
01:10:05,720 --> 01:10:10,760
where we talk about the individual cases, and the mentality of the man behind them.

1097
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:17,640
So yes, that was the video. I want to thank all my collaborators who've done such a fantastic job.

1098
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:23,800
Your contributions are greatly appreciated, and I'm sending my love to all of you. I don't really

1099
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:29,000
have too much else to add to this video. As said, stay tuned. Wanna give a big shout out to my

1100
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:35,320
editors, my patreons, editors and patreons together. Imagine that, that would be wild.

1101
01:10:35,320 --> 01:10:41,240
But yeah, my editors, check them all out. Patreons on the screen right now, I've got a few individual

1102
01:10:41,240 --> 01:10:47,320
thanks to give. I wanna give a big shout out to my $50 patreons, Sam Hallabaloo, Nico Deschamps,

1103
01:10:47,320 --> 01:10:54,040
and Caroline, and a very special thanks to my $100 patreons, Brandon and Stanton. Stanton's a new

1104
01:10:54,040 --> 01:11:01,000
guy. Thank you again, Brandon's a classical OG, thank you too. If you wanna reach me, my Twitter

1105
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:06,680
