00:00.000 --> 00:18.720
Life. It's a thing. That happens. To pretty much everyone in some capacity.

00:18.720 --> 00:24.160
From the day that life begins to the day it ends, it encompasses an experience unique to that individual.

00:24.160 --> 00:27.600
How that individual may interpret their own life is also something unique,

00:27.600 --> 00:34.000
although there are overarching categories that we may relate, such as happiness, sadness, or in my case, boredom.

00:34.000 --> 00:40.880
People's lives beyond one's own, and their own interpretations of it, have become much more intimate to audiences

00:40.880 --> 00:46.560
over the rise of YouTube. We often see what a person may be going through, but we also may see how they react to it,

00:46.560 --> 00:52.400
and how they interpret it themselves. How much of your life ends up on the internet is principally your discretion,

00:52.400 --> 01:00.080
though there are often exceptions. Today's topic, Onision, is someone who's life, on the surface, seems like the pinnacle

01:00.080 --> 01:04.320
of YouTube melodrama, and the eventful nature that surrounds it.

01:11.360 --> 01:16.320
For over ten years, he has projected his life into the public sphere. He has made countless videos and posts

01:16.320 --> 01:20.960
regarding his past, present, and future. He has been the center of numerous controversies,

01:20.960 --> 01:28.960
and the subject of multiple exposes involving his friends, enemies, and so many more people that I cannot even begin to factor in.

01:28.960 --> 01:35.680
When serious drama occurs, the stress and additional repercussions will often drive many off online platforms.

01:35.680 --> 01:42.080
Onision is a clear exception to that rule, in fact, attention just seems to bring him back with even more aggression,

01:42.080 --> 01:46.680
so I didn't want to make this video under the pretense that it wasn't going to play into his hands.

01:46.680 --> 01:52.880
In fact, even Onision wants me to make this video on him, though I'm not sure it will be exactly what he hoped for.

01:52.880 --> 01:58.400
He did contact me stating that if I'm interested, he can offer evidence to exonerate him of certain claims.

01:58.400 --> 02:02.880
However, over the last couple of months, I have already grown an aversion to such private interactions,

02:02.880 --> 02:07.560
I'm not going to be a YouTuber's shield when they have more than enough platforms to defend themselves already.

02:07.560 --> 02:11.720
Anything that someone wants me to present in public, they can present it themselves.

02:11.760 --> 02:17.560
Today's video is going to be a look at as much published, and the attempt to understand what that says about the person in question,

02:17.560 --> 02:24.440
and maybe a few laughs and jokes along the way, but given the volume there is to look at, it's hard to tell exactly where to start.

02:24.440 --> 02:32.040
I guess the best place is a brief history of Onision, but trying to summarise exactly what has happened there is a task much easier said than done.

02:32.040 --> 02:38.280
What we could really use is a historian, for the internet, you know, an internet historian of sorts.

02:38.520 --> 02:47.400
Oh, what's that? He's busy. Doing raid sponsorships. Well, that's fine. I didn't want him anyway. I know someone better.

02:47.400 --> 02:52.560
Hey, hello, thanks for having me on, that's really nice of you. I'm very happy to be here, actually.

02:52.560 --> 02:59.600
I hope everyone's just having a fantastic day. My name is Pinely, I also have a YouTube channel that you should really subscribe to.

02:59.600 --> 03:06.280
And fun fact about me, I'm actually a pretty massive Onision fan. I think he is just the best.

03:06.280 --> 03:10.640
I don't want Mulder to take me to Area 51!

03:10.640 --> 03:15.400
Oh, he's so swell. How could he even not like this fine young man?

03:15.400 --> 03:21.560
You know, I remember how a few years ago I was watching him dancing around and singing in that banana costume,

03:21.560 --> 03:26.000
and at that moment I was thinking to myself, damn, I guess this is it.

03:26.000 --> 03:30.880
This is where comedy has truly reached its peak, and since I'm such a massive fanboy of Greg,

03:30.880 --> 03:35.120
I've actually made sure to keep track of everything this man has ever done since he was born.

03:35.160 --> 03:37.840
So this is what we're gonna talk about today in Pinely's Corner.

03:37.840 --> 03:41.160
Greg's various projects from before he started his YouTube channel.

03:41.160 --> 03:42.680
Ready? Okay.

03:42.680 --> 03:49.720
So back in 2002, when Greg was just a 17-year-old boy, he created this very cool website called Hybrid Eye.

03:49.720 --> 03:53.920
As you can see, the design is really scary... and orange.

03:53.920 --> 03:56.120
Let's read the description, shall we, folks?

03:56.120 --> 04:03.240
Please feel free to browse all of the links. If done so, you will find many intriguing pieces of literature and graphics.

04:03.240 --> 04:06.120
Some areas of Hybrid Eye will have a symbol like...

04:06.120 --> 04:12.360
Oh, basically stating that the words or images could be slightly disturbing to those under the age of 14.

04:12.360 --> 04:15.160
And sadly, some in their 40s.

04:15.160 --> 04:19.720
Greg also decided to call himself Odd on this website, that was his name.

04:19.720 --> 04:22.520
Just so you guys can know that he's really weird.

04:22.520 --> 04:24.600
He's not really your average Joe.

04:24.600 --> 04:30.200
He makes really deep poems about religion, the Stone Age, and some other sensitive stuff.

04:30.200 --> 04:34.920
That website lasted a whole year before eventually collapsing into itself and dying.

04:34.920 --> 04:39.960
He later moved on to making quite a lot of gaming related websites with a friend of his called Jad.

04:39.960 --> 04:45.160
They had one about Metal Gear Solid and a game review website called Gamer's Shadow.

04:45.160 --> 04:47.480
Apparently, there was some drama surrounding that one.

04:47.480 --> 04:50.920
Some evil people were making fun of poor old Greg.

04:50.920 --> 04:53.480
So yeah, he had to ban all of them.

04:53.480 --> 04:56.120
2003 was also a pretty busy year for him.

04:56.120 --> 05:01.880
He made yet another gaming website with his friend called Extreme Gaming Headquarters.

05:01.880 --> 05:03.240
Yeah, you heard that right.

05:03.240 --> 05:04.440
It's extreme.

05:04.440 --> 05:07.640
You can see from the design of it just how extreme it really is.

05:07.640 --> 05:15.640
The Extreme Gaming Headquarters is an online gaming society made up of elite gaming fans and pros.

05:15.640 --> 05:19.560
He also created like a billion different websites for web hosting,

05:19.560 --> 05:21.800
website promotion, and website developing.

05:21.800 --> 05:24.280
But that's kind of boring, so I'm not gonna dwell on that.

05:24.280 --> 05:30.360
More importantly, he made another website to show off all of his literature and poems and whatnot.

05:30.360 --> 05:32.680
It's exactly what's been missing from my life.

05:32.680 --> 05:35.400
First off, again, a sick design.

05:35.400 --> 05:36.920
Looks real futuristic.

05:36.920 --> 05:38.920
And what's really good about this website

05:38.920 --> 05:41.960
is that I was actually able to find some of the pieces that were on it.

05:41.960 --> 05:44.920
So I hope you're ready to hear one of them because here we go.

05:46.120 --> 05:47.560
What is a pointless fight?

05:48.200 --> 05:50.760
Why do senseless conflicts happen?

05:50.760 --> 05:53.240
Who are the ones who fall victim to these battles?

05:53.240 --> 05:58.840
Over the past, humanity has been damaged deeply by pathetic and disgraceful wars

05:58.840 --> 06:02.360
that happened both between politicians and among average peasants.

06:02.360 --> 06:05.640
Today, smaller verbal battles occur all over our schools.

06:05.640 --> 06:08.200
An individual calls another a foul name,

06:08.200 --> 06:11.720
and immediately the victims think they have some sort of honor to defend.

06:11.720 --> 06:13.720
And this resorts to a fight.

06:13.720 --> 06:15.160
I find this very funny.

06:15.160 --> 06:18.840
This is clearly a guy who really wants you to think that he's so, so smart.

06:18.840 --> 06:21.480
When in reality, that's not really too accurate.

06:21.480 --> 06:22.520
Average peasants.

06:22.520 --> 06:23.400
Jesus Christ.

06:23.400 --> 06:25.240
Then we reach 2004.

06:25.240 --> 06:27.400
Greg graduated from high school,

06:27.400 --> 06:30.120
and you can really tell that at this point he was all like,

06:30.120 --> 06:33.000
Oh, well, I'm not going to see any of these people ever again.

06:33.000 --> 06:33.640
You know what?

06:33.640 --> 06:37.240
I might as well just show off my really, really awful opinions,

06:37.240 --> 06:38.520
because why the hell not?

06:38.520 --> 06:40.760
And that's exactly what he did later that year.

06:40.760 --> 06:45.000
So the first website he made in 2004 was definitely not as bad as the second one.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.800
Greg would just talk about some radio show he liked.

06:47.800 --> 06:49.080
I don't really care.

06:49.080 --> 06:52.760
Later on, around a year later, he turned that site into a website all about him.

06:52.760 --> 06:54.440
The Gregory J website.

06:54.440 --> 06:58.920
He also made this one really, really, really stupid website.

06:58.920 --> 07:02.440
I think it also showcases what kind of person we're really dealing with here.

07:02.440 --> 07:04.840
The site was called Rape Prevention Info.

07:04.840 --> 07:05.480
Yikes.

07:05.480 --> 07:07.320
And here's the description of it.

07:07.320 --> 07:09.320
My name is Gregory J. Daniel.

07:09.320 --> 07:11.560
I am a man of dignity and integrity.

07:11.560 --> 07:16.520
And today I look at our society in recognition of what mockery we have become

07:16.520 --> 07:21.240
due to lack of enforcement of rape crimes that occur every moment of every day.

07:21.240 --> 07:25.800
Not too long ago, I was appalled by suggestions that women dressed themselves up as if they were

07:25.800 --> 07:29.400
homeless or mentally handicapped just to avoid an attack.

07:29.400 --> 07:33.400
This is terrible advice, as hostiles do not always choose based on attraction.

07:33.400 --> 07:35.800
They do it off of who looks most vulnerable.

07:35.800 --> 07:36.520
Weakest.

07:36.520 --> 07:38.600
Today, you will learn how to defend yourself.

07:38.600 --> 07:41.480
When you are through, you will find what true freedom is.

07:41.480 --> 07:45.640
Dress how you like, live how you like, and be ready for the worst.

07:45.640 --> 07:51.560
For if you are, no attacker will ever be able to walk away without they themselves being a victim.

07:51.560 --> 07:55.960
I don't know what made him think this is a good call to make this website.

07:55.960 --> 07:58.120
He's just so clearly full of himself.

07:58.120 --> 08:02.920
You can just see that he thought that he's some sort of savior for all women all around the world.

08:02.920 --> 08:04.120
I know, you might say,

08:04.120 --> 08:07.400
Oh, finally, he was just trying to help people out.

08:07.400 --> 08:09.000
Why are you being like this, man?

08:09.000 --> 08:11.720
Well, I don't know if that's really something that could be said.

08:11.720 --> 08:14.280
When some of the advice that he gave is stuff like,

08:14.280 --> 08:15.160
I don't know.

08:15.160 --> 08:19.000
Act like you are possessed by a demon or mentally handicapped.

08:19.000 --> 08:23.400
Oh, and who can forget about have a bowel movement and rub it in his face.

08:23.400 --> 08:28.360
In 2005, he went on to make another website dedicated to documenting his time in the army.

08:28.360 --> 08:30.920
And then a year later, he found himself on YouTube.

08:30.920 --> 08:33.560
And I think I'll let the right opinion continue from here.

08:33.560 --> 08:35.800
Thank you all for having me on this channel.

08:35.800 --> 08:38.440
And hey, make sure to subscribe to Pinely.

08:38.440 --> 08:41.080
It would make me feel really good and happy.

08:44.680 --> 08:47.480
Oh, guys, look, it's the Internet Historian.

08:47.480 --> 08:47.980
Yay!

08:48.680 --> 08:50.440
Uh, thank you, thank you.

08:50.440 --> 08:51.240
Is Tro here?

08:51.240 --> 08:53.080
Uh, no, I don't think so.

08:53.080 --> 08:53.880
Good.

08:53.880 --> 08:55.480
Why are you running a balaclava?

08:56.360 --> 08:57.560
Showman here.

08:57.560 --> 08:59.480
That's right, I'm even on other channels.

08:59.480 --> 09:01.320
Have you heard about Rayman Legends?

09:01.320 --> 09:04.520
It's a new game sweeping the nation like a deadly virus.

09:04.520 --> 09:07.400
And now it's coming for you and your family.

09:07.400 --> 09:11.240
Play clip of large crowd of people talking about Raid.

09:11.240 --> 09:13.080
You haven't heard of Raid Shadow Legends?

09:13.080 --> 09:16.280
Raid Shadow Legends is a free RPG PVP.

09:16.280 --> 09:17.480
Look at those ratings.

09:17.480 --> 09:18.760
People are going wild.

09:19.960 --> 09:21.160
That one didn't look too wild.

09:21.160 --> 09:22.840
Here's a more measured review.

09:22.840 --> 09:26.520
It has over 15 million downloads in the last six months.

09:26.520 --> 09:30.360
That's over three times the population of the Central African Republic.

09:30.360 --> 09:33.880
And six months, that's over three times the average lifespan.

09:34.440 --> 09:35.640
Wow, impressive.

09:35.640 --> 09:38.280
In fact, I'm so impressed, I'm flying there right now.

09:38.280 --> 09:39.800
Please put your phone away, sir.

09:39.800 --> 09:40.680
We are about to take-

09:40.680 --> 09:41.720
Just fuck off, lady.

09:41.720 --> 09:45.880
I'm customizing over 400 champions that I can collect in the game.

09:45.880 --> 09:47.160
Raid Shadow Legends, huh?

09:47.160 --> 09:49.160
Sir, please, the plane is about to crash.

09:51.480 --> 09:53.400
Wow, what a spectacular view.

09:53.400 --> 09:56.680
Almost as spectacular as the 13 unique in-game-

09:57.480 --> 09:59.480
True, how much longer does this ad go for?

09:59.480 --> 10:00.760
Speaking of dungeons,

10:00.760 --> 10:04.520
make sure you participate in the weekly events to win extra prizes.

10:04.520 --> 10:06.200
The prizes are off the charts.

10:06.200 --> 10:08.920
I can barely contain my excitement.

10:08.920 --> 10:10.520
They've even got a new roadmap.

10:10.520 --> 10:12.840
Who needs Google Maps when you have this baby?

10:12.840 --> 10:13.960
You can play with me, too.

10:13.960 --> 10:15.320
Please raid someone.

10:16.840 --> 10:18.840
I'm gonna raid Shadow Legends.

10:19.560 --> 10:20.840
And you should, too.

10:20.840 --> 10:23.320
Click on the link and claim your epic new hero

10:23.320 --> 10:27.240
and 50,000 non-transferable pieces of silver on...

10:28.200 --> 10:30.440
Raid Shades of Light.

10:30.440 --> 10:34.840
I do sincerely hope you all feel enlightened, because I know I sure do.

10:34.840 --> 10:38.120
But this is the last non-dramatic phase that we'll be covering,

10:38.200 --> 10:41.800
because Onision, believe it or not, is quite a dramatic person.

10:41.800 --> 10:46.360
Now, that was a rather neutral, albeit humorous, perspective on Onision's background prior,

10:46.360 --> 10:48.840
and during his ascent on this beautiful platform.

10:48.840 --> 10:53.400
As noted, he was a real veteran of the internet who had a vision of where he wanted to be,

10:53.400 --> 10:57.080
before many people had even realised the potential of online stardom.

10:57.080 --> 11:01.800
But he was much more a person who tended to fire whatever at the wall with the hope it would stick,

11:01.800 --> 11:04.200
and that formula would not deviate with YouTube.

11:04.200 --> 11:08.840
Old YouTube was created off the basis of weird, wacky, and typically quite annoying.

11:08.840 --> 11:14.040
The obsession with LeFunny voice and LeFunny face is what bolstered Onision's career,

11:14.040 --> 11:18.520
but there was something edgier to what he made, though not always.

11:18.520 --> 11:35.480
You see, Onision was more than just a performative persona, like many creators at the time.

11:35.480 --> 11:39.160
If you were going off his main channel, you probably would have the impression that he takes

11:39.160 --> 11:43.480
pride, and maybe even catharsis, in a slightly unstable character.

11:43.480 --> 11:47.880
However, it didn't stop there, Onision had created a more personal side to him.

11:47.880 --> 11:50.920
This would mainly be projected on the Onision Speaks channel,

11:50.920 --> 11:54.600
although it did sometimes spill over to the other sides of the internet.

11:54.600 --> 12:00.120
Imagine if Fred started a channel where he scrapped the funny voice and began discussing abortion.

12:00.120 --> 12:03.880
That was basically what Onision Speaks was to Onision,

12:03.880 --> 12:08.760
but I think this quickly spelled out two things to a large majority of the audiences.

12:08.760 --> 12:13.160
Firstly, that Onision's personal life was going to become a very public matter,

12:13.160 --> 12:16.760
and secondly, my god, Onision likes to talk about himself.

12:16.760 --> 12:21.880
Now, narcissism is a trait found in a fair few creators, and it's not always disruptive,

12:21.880 --> 12:27.000
but with Onision it was a different brand, and many audiences played into that brand,

12:27.000 --> 12:29.720
whether that attention was positive or negative.

12:29.720 --> 12:33.560
One thing that I would say is that the design of the brand Onision Speaks,

12:33.560 --> 12:38.680
initially being an outlet of Onision rather than making it a more personal venture to him,

12:38.680 --> 12:42.840
showed the proximity of the Onision brand to our friend Greg here,

12:42.840 --> 12:46.200
so he probably weren't going to receive the best dose of sanity.

12:46.200 --> 12:49.800
A great example was his early crusade against meat-eaters.

12:49.800 --> 12:54.760
Onision's main channel would put out some wacky video, maybe with an underlying message,

12:54.760 --> 12:57.000
but you wouldn't take it too seriously.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.560
Onision Speaks- If you feel kicking an animal isn't right,

12:59.560 --> 13:02.680
if you think that torturing living creatures is wrong,

13:02.680 --> 13:05.880
and yet you yourself still consume animals,

13:05.880 --> 13:07.480
don't even waste your breath, Moo.

13:07.480 --> 13:09.160
Don't waste our time, Moo.

13:09.160 --> 13:12.440
You're just as bad as the people that slit our throats, Moo.

13:12.440 --> 13:18.120
And Onision would come in and undercut that with a clarification about how this wacky message

13:18.120 --> 13:21.880
was actually very authentic, and you should definitely listen to it.

13:21.880 --> 13:25.080
Onision Speaks- Vegans do what they do out of necessity.

13:25.080 --> 13:27.560
They save animals by doing what they do.

13:27.560 --> 13:31.400
They save themselves by doing what they do.

13:31.400 --> 13:35.960
Meat-eaters do what they do for whatever reason they do.

13:35.960 --> 13:37.720
Slowly killing themselves.

13:37.720 --> 13:42.280
Onision was online, and alongside came a close-up documenting of his life,

13:42.280 --> 13:47.160
and the next decade of relationships and drama that we will have the displeasure of covering

13:47.160 --> 13:49.160
over however long this takes.

13:49.160 --> 13:53.720
In many ways, it'd be convenient to create a linear timeline of Onision's behaviour,

13:53.720 --> 13:57.000
but honestly, I don't think that we'll be able to do that justice,

13:57.000 --> 13:59.640
because that implies a simple rationalisation,

13:59.640 --> 14:03.240
or at least explanation that can be observed in a chronological way.

14:03.240 --> 14:07.960
And let's face it, Onision isn't exactly known for his rational behaviour,

14:07.960 --> 14:12.280
so we're going to be doing a documenting of all of it, all over the board,

14:12.280 --> 14:15.000
and seeing what exactly it tells us.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.960
Let's start small and move on to greater things.

14:17.960 --> 14:23.000
I'd also like to preface the fact that I've split this video into three rather meaty parts,

14:23.000 --> 14:26.040
and apologise for any inconvenience that may cause.

14:26.040 --> 14:27.960
I hope they will all be worth their time.

14:29.400 --> 14:32.840
Onision has been relatively successful given his stint on YouTube,

14:32.840 --> 14:35.240
and success means you're doing something right.

14:35.240 --> 14:40.040
I think for this part, it's best we look at that before delving into the darker side.

14:40.040 --> 14:43.400
Now, I said at the start that Onision clearly enjoys attention,

14:43.400 --> 14:48.440
and I do believe, to an extent, that motivation is the real bedrock of his content.

14:48.440 --> 14:51.240
Now, so what? A lot of people enjoy attention,

14:51.240 --> 14:54.120
and even if the subject matters were a bit socially loaded,

14:54.120 --> 14:58.920
you could take a lot of his earlier content as somewhat removed from the constraints of discourse,

14:58.920 --> 15:00.920
even if they were bizarre as hell.

15:00.920 --> 15:03.800
Nonetheless, the desire for attention manifests itself,

15:03.800 --> 15:07.240
particularly when you, as a creator, have very little to offer.

15:07.240 --> 15:11.800
And let's be honest here, Onision isn't the most inherently talented person,

15:11.800 --> 15:14.760
he couldn't really sing, he couldn't really act,

15:14.760 --> 15:18.840
he didn't really have any exceptionally insightful social commentary,

15:18.840 --> 15:21.160
all he knew was about attention,

15:21.160 --> 15:25.240
and as people's bar for comedy and other creative content was rising,

15:25.240 --> 15:27.080
Onision wasn't changing.

15:27.080 --> 15:30.600
In spite of this, there is a key to maintaining internet relevance,

15:30.600 --> 15:33.320
and that's creating a relationship with your audience.

15:33.320 --> 15:35.800
Relationships can be created over different mediums,

15:35.800 --> 15:40.600
but for many creators, that relationship can be as simple as sharing experiences.

15:40.600 --> 15:43.400
Sometimes a creator will make more personal videos to do that,

15:43.400 --> 15:45.640
sometimes that means breaking character.

15:45.640 --> 15:49.560
With Onision, openness became a gimmick, there was nothing off limits.

15:49.560 --> 15:51.880
When many creators open up, we will see it as brave,

15:51.880 --> 15:54.200
as it's often a risking element to their persona.

15:54.200 --> 15:59.400
With Onision Speaks, every time he spoke about something, it tackled sensitive topics,

15:59.400 --> 16:01.720
and even if the views themselves weren't the greatest,

16:01.720 --> 16:04.200
he was developing something of a cult persona.

16:04.200 --> 16:07.640
It also allowed him to tackle more serious topics with a degree of clout.

16:07.640 --> 16:10.440
He would upload videos on an incredibly regular basis,

16:10.440 --> 16:14.600
and it provided a medium to create a closer relationship with Daddy over here.

16:14.600 --> 16:18.040
I don't really know where I stand on a few issues,

16:18.040 --> 16:24.440
if I am the villain or the hero, if I am good or pure evil myself.

16:25.240 --> 16:28.920
If by doing everything the right way, the way that I thought was best,

16:28.920 --> 16:30.680
was really even the right way at all.

16:31.560 --> 16:36.200
Because it seems that by doing the things that I feel makes this world better,

16:36.200 --> 16:39.320
or doing the things that I feel make me a good person,

16:40.040 --> 16:47.560
I am in fact contradicting everyone else, and I wonder if wrong is right and I am wrong.

16:47.560 --> 16:50.120
You have to remember that we're in 2010,

16:50.120 --> 16:53.960
a time when many of the largest creators wouldn't be considered celebrities,

16:53.960 --> 16:56.920
so many of them would have a decent interaction with their audience.

16:56.920 --> 17:01.000
Onision at that point was in the top 100 most subscribed creators,

17:01.000 --> 17:02.200
as strange as that is,

17:02.200 --> 17:05.480
so having a channel which allowed people to become closer with him

17:05.480 --> 17:08.360
was a strong foundation for a more dedicated fanbase,

17:08.360 --> 17:10.520
and the fact that he had that level of attention at all

17:10.520 --> 17:12.840
would mean that there would always be a certain amount of people

17:12.840 --> 17:15.640
who idolized him for that popularity alone.

17:15.640 --> 17:19.800
However, not necessarily satisfied with the simplicity of a regular fanbase,

17:19.800 --> 17:24.440
Onision always had a slightly different approach to developing his fanbase beyond.

17:24.440 --> 17:26.520
You cannot choose who supports you,

17:26.520 --> 17:31.240
however, your actions and behavior can definitely shape your audience to a reasonable degree,

17:31.240 --> 17:34.440
particularly if you know how to exclude a demographic.

17:34.440 --> 17:39.080
This can be done, for example, by taking advantage of polarizing insensitive topics.

17:39.080 --> 17:43.240
Now, it's hard to say I know too many people who actively shape their audience,

17:43.240 --> 17:47.480
it's something hard to do if you're just trying to make content for yourself,

17:47.480 --> 17:50.600
but I am of the belief that Onision definitely did.

17:50.600 --> 17:54.200
I'll explain more soon, but first I want to focus on his techniques.

17:54.200 --> 17:58.840
And what this all clearly comes down to is if you are pro-circumcision,

17:58.840 --> 18:01.720
then you are helping the rapist.

18:01.720 --> 18:04.040
You cannot feel with something that does not exist,

18:04.040 --> 18:06.120
and when you promote the removal of the foreskin,

18:06.120 --> 18:08.360
not only are you making the penis less sensitive,

18:08.360 --> 18:10.760
but you are also desensitizing it to pain.

18:10.760 --> 18:14.440
A pain that is intended to naturally occur in the uncircumcised penis of a man

18:14.440 --> 18:18.280
who is attempting to destroy a woman both physically and psychologically.

18:18.280 --> 18:20.600
One thing that Onision knew was how to provoke.

18:20.600 --> 18:23.000
He was never one to be afraid of confrontation,

18:23.000 --> 18:26.840
and confrontation is sometimes a good way to really build an audience.

18:26.840 --> 18:29.480
If you pick a point of view or a strong opinion,

18:29.480 --> 18:33.720
you will find an audience who will respect your outspoken and confident demeanor,

18:33.720 --> 18:36.920
even if you have no actual clue what you're speaking about.

18:36.920 --> 18:41.000
Onision was not qualified in any of the topics that he spoke about to my knowledge,

18:41.000 --> 18:43.320
but he tackled them nonetheless.

18:43.320 --> 18:47.160
Obviously, this sort of drama was documented with his meat-eater's content.

18:47.160 --> 18:50.200
However, over the years, he would regularly have public fallings out,

18:50.200 --> 18:52.120
with whoever he could manage.

18:52.120 --> 18:56.840
Sorry, I'm just starting to get really sick of hearing about this asshole starting a new drama,

18:56.840 --> 18:58.120
and he can sit back and say,

18:58.120 --> 19:01.960
oh, he's learned his lesson and it's so hard having these opinions,

19:01.960 --> 19:06.680
and we all know in another three months when his views start to plateau again,

19:06.680 --> 19:08.520
that he's gonna start some new shit.

19:08.520 --> 19:11.320
From 2010, when he had a feud with Shay Carl,

19:11.320 --> 19:13.880
over Shay's decision to circumcise his son,

19:13.880 --> 19:16.440
to 2016, when he had a feud with Cyr,

19:16.440 --> 19:19.720
because he voted for a third-party candidate in California.

19:19.720 --> 19:22.120
These are the sorts of ideologically loaded topics

19:22.120 --> 19:25.240
that would obviously attract fans and critics alike.

19:25.240 --> 19:28.360
He would regularly express controversial opinions on rape,

19:28.360 --> 19:32.920
self-harm, suicide, and multiple other issues that would really rile people up.

19:32.920 --> 19:35.320
He would also regularly go after multiple creators

19:35.320 --> 19:38.600
whose content and audience may even overlap into his,

19:38.600 --> 19:40.440
such as his feud with Shane Dawson,

19:40.440 --> 19:43.080
a person who he collaborated with, was friends with,

19:43.080 --> 19:45.000
and even shared a romantic kiss with.

19:46.360 --> 19:47.400
Yet, in spite of this,

19:47.400 --> 19:49.560
him and Shane had a significant amount of drama,

19:49.560 --> 19:53.560
particularly relating to how Onision felt Shane had treated him as a friend,

19:53.560 --> 19:56.120
which there may be some legitimate annoyance in.

19:56.120 --> 19:59.640
However, since then, Onision just made multiple videos on Shane Dawson,

19:59.640 --> 20:01.240
mostly attempting to call him out,

20:01.240 --> 20:05.800
but often just trying to work out a way to bring problems back to how Shane had treated him.

20:05.800 --> 20:06.600
Shane Dawson.

20:06.600 --> 20:09.080
Oh God, Onision's making another video about him.

20:09.080 --> 20:11.080
But talking about him has a lot of advantages.

20:11.080 --> 20:12.920
Number one, his name attracts video views.

20:12.920 --> 20:15.240
Number two, on a regular basis, people imply that I look like him,

20:15.240 --> 20:17.640
which gives me this immortal, annoying association.

20:17.640 --> 20:19.240
Number three, I really don't like him,

20:19.240 --> 20:21.240
and ranting about him is therapeutic for me.

20:21.240 --> 20:24.760
The one time that Onision did try and make a more serious call-out video

20:24.760 --> 20:27.800
is in the form of this 50 millet pseudo-documentary,

20:27.800 --> 20:30.840
in which he states that he believes Shane Dawson is a pedophile.

20:30.840 --> 20:33.320
Actually, no, that would be unfair.

20:33.320 --> 20:36.120
He doesn't say for certain he's a pedophile,

20:36.120 --> 20:39.560
he just goes through talking about how Shane Dawson fulfills

20:39.560 --> 20:42.760
a large majority of the prerequisites to being a child predator.

20:42.760 --> 20:47.160
Wait, Shane Dawson just said that he doesn't tell those jokes anymore.

20:47.160 --> 20:49.800
So lying is obviously the number one tactic of predators,

20:49.800 --> 20:51.080
as you can see at the top right here.

20:51.080 --> 20:53.640
Not telling the whole story, that's what Shane did

20:53.640 --> 20:57.400
by not addressing every single clip that he says was taken out of context,

20:57.400 --> 21:00.840
but instead he only addressed one where he proved that it was taken out of context.

21:00.840 --> 21:05.320
He was jumping all over the place with mood swings by screaming and cussing

21:05.320 --> 21:07.800
and then being all normal and then getting kind of emotional.

21:07.800 --> 21:10.440
The punishment again is the yelling and the cussing.

21:10.440 --> 21:11.960
The denial is very clear.

21:11.960 --> 21:15.800
Finning the truth, trying to devalue everything that's said about him

21:15.800 --> 21:19.000
by saying it's all just jokes and that he was saying messed up jokes,

21:19.000 --> 21:21.800
but never really again telling the whole story

21:21.800 --> 21:24.760
like him trying to justify people being a pedo.

21:24.760 --> 21:27.800
Where in one podcast he said that he didn't view it as very different

21:27.800 --> 21:29.480
from people who have foot fetishes.

21:29.480 --> 21:32.680
Or the clip that I played you where he states that he doesn't understand

21:32.680 --> 21:35.480
why people get arrested for looking at children who are not clothed.

21:35.480 --> 21:36.840
And again, that's minimalizing.

21:36.840 --> 21:38.680
And then of course he went to play the victim.

21:38.680 --> 21:42.680
You could say he targeted the victim, i.e. people calling him out,

21:42.680 --> 21:45.240
but the real victims are to be determined,

21:45.240 --> 21:50.680
because so far all he said is that he googled actual children in that situation.

21:50.680 --> 21:53.000
So I guess it would be all the children that he googled

21:53.000 --> 21:54.840
and describe the results that he saw.

21:54.840 --> 21:57.960
These were claims he reiterated for a significant amount of time,

21:57.960 --> 22:00.760
and although he did apologize approximately five months ago,

22:00.760 --> 22:04.360
it is undisputed that this feud likely alienated audiences

22:04.360 --> 22:06.840
who may have found Onision through Shane's content,

22:06.840 --> 22:09.560
something that Onision does acknowledge himself.

22:09.560 --> 22:13.560
Now, to be frank, I think the treatment of Shane by Onision has been rather poor,

22:13.560 --> 22:17.320
given the number of videos made, the tone of these videos, and the message.

22:17.320 --> 22:19.960
However, you could at least make the rational argument that

22:19.960 --> 22:22.840
Onision was bitter and upset about a friendship.

22:22.840 --> 22:26.520
What would happen if we went one step further and visited a situation

22:26.520 --> 22:30.840
where there was no way of stating any coherent explanation together,

22:30.840 --> 22:34.040
and yet as of right now, it is probably one of the key examples

22:34.040 --> 22:35.720
to the next point in my video.

22:35.720 --> 22:37.560
But maybe to illuminate this situation,

22:37.560 --> 22:40.920
we should spin the wheel and see which commentator can help me out.

22:43.640 --> 22:44.680
Take it away, my G.

22:46.040 --> 22:48.200
Well, mom, I finally made it.

22:49.240 --> 22:50.360
I'm on the right opinion.

22:52.440 --> 22:53.880
But I'm talking about Onision.

22:57.880 --> 23:02.120
I'm currently a bit under the weather, but never as sick as my buddy Greg,

23:02.120 --> 23:06.520
the man who obsessively harassed, mocked, and exploited a fellow YouTuber

23:06.520 --> 23:09.080
with an eating disorder for nearly three years.

23:09.080 --> 23:11.480
I'm of course referring to Eugenia Cooney.

23:11.480 --> 23:15.560
If anybody was in the dark about Eugenia Cooney and her controversial time on YouTube,

23:15.560 --> 23:18.040
Shane Dawson swooped in and filled everybody in.

23:18.040 --> 23:22.280
But if you're still out of the loop, Eugenia Cooney was your average 2013 YouTuber,

23:22.280 --> 23:27.080
just a happy young girl doing Q&As, participating in tags, and showing off outfits.

23:27.080 --> 23:30.840
Fast forward three years where a man named Greg would make a video on her,

23:30.840 --> 23:33.000
and unfortunately, change her life.

23:33.000 --> 23:36.280
And just so you're aware, the majority of these videos are AWOL in the shadow realm,

23:36.280 --> 23:38.040
because deleting evidence is always fun.

23:38.040 --> 23:39.800
But thankfully, they've all been documented.

23:39.800 --> 23:43.960
Believe it or not, but the first video that Onision made on Eugenia Cooney on May 9th,

23:43.960 --> 23:46.200
2016 was actually defending her.

23:46.200 --> 23:49.960
I mean, with a title like Eugenia Cooney is anorexic, you wouldn't think so,

23:49.960 --> 23:54.440
but Onision simply compared her body to a supermodel's, claiming they weren't that different.

23:54.440 --> 23:58.120
Four months later, Onision's opinion quickly changed with the titled video,

23:58.840 --> 23:59.800
Eugenia Cooney.

23:59.800 --> 24:04.200
And a whopping 10 Eugenia videos would follow in the next two months.

24:04.200 --> 24:10.120
Onision was clearly worried about paying rent or something because it became very apparent

24:10.120 --> 24:14.040
that Eugenia was more so a cash cow to Onision than a charity case.

24:14.040 --> 24:17.240
A supposed cry for help became a target on Eugenia's back.

24:17.240 --> 24:22.280
Onision would urge his viewers to unsubscribe to Eugenia if she did not gain weight in a

24:22.280 --> 24:26.520
certain amount of time, claiming that if you continued supporting her, you would be helping

24:26.520 --> 24:27.080
her die.

24:27.080 --> 24:30.360
Now, thankfully, Onision announced in early October of that year that

24:30.360 --> 24:34.280
he had no plans about making any more Eugenia videos in the future.

24:34.280 --> 24:35.000
But tweets?

24:35.000 --> 24:35.880
That's fair game.

24:35.880 --> 24:36.840
At Onision,

24:36.840 --> 24:40.120
Give her a more I care about you but I'm not humiliating you approach.

24:40.120 --> 24:43.080
Tried that, but Eugenia, the obvious sociopath

24:43.080 --> 24:47.080
Onision accused people of being a sociopath before it was cool

24:47.080 --> 24:50.200
continues to inspire young girls to starve themselves regardless.

24:50.200 --> 24:53.080
At Onision, you think humiliating her is the way to fix it?

24:53.080 --> 24:55.400
If someone is without any doubt killing themselves,

24:55.400 --> 24:58.280
bringing attention to their condition is the least you could do.

24:58.280 --> 24:59.880
Anorexia is lethal.

24:59.880 --> 25:02.040
Greg has a funny way of responding to people.

25:02.040 --> 25:04.520
Yeah, I'll take a voting the question for 500 Alex.

25:04.520 --> 25:07.480
Shortly after a petition was made to get Eugenia off YouTube,

25:07.480 --> 25:12.040
Onision just couldn't help himself and off the wagon he went.

25:12.040 --> 25:13.560
This would quickly become a trend.

25:13.560 --> 25:16.680
Onision would say he's resigning on the topic of Eugenia,

25:16.680 --> 25:20.040
but then proceed to talk about Eugenia because

25:20.040 --> 25:23.560
Last time I checked, when you resign from something, you can take it up again if you choose.

25:23.560 --> 25:24.680
Why even say that Greg?

25:24.680 --> 25:25.480
The hell's the point?

25:25.480 --> 25:28.520
Just say the possibility is always there or don't cap it off.

25:28.520 --> 25:29.800
Just just leave it.

25:30.680 --> 25:34.280
Regardless of what somebody is saying, you should always look at their intent.

25:34.280 --> 25:35.400
Why are they doing this?

25:35.400 --> 25:38.840
Onision could push his anti-anorexia campaign all he wanted,

25:38.840 --> 25:41.080
but as long as he kept uploading videos like this

25:41.960 --> 25:53.640
His intent was clear.

25:53.640 --> 25:54.840
Now sure, some could say,

25:54.840 --> 25:58.920
well his method of saving Eugenia is abrasive, but it could prove effective.

25:58.920 --> 25:59.960
I wouldn't be so sure.

25:59.960 --> 26:02.280
This is essentially the equivalent of fat-shaming,

26:02.280 --> 26:05.640
which according to a professor of health psychology at the University of Sarain,

26:05.640 --> 26:10.200
a 2019 article from BBC, shaming is the wrong way to move forward.

26:10.200 --> 26:14.200
Even in the example of somebody claiming fat-shaming led to them losing weight,

26:14.200 --> 26:17.880
Professor Jane Ogden says that experience is atypical.

26:17.880 --> 26:22.520
At this point, Greg's videos were garnering hundreds of thousands, if not millions of views.

26:22.520 --> 26:25.640
So it wasn't a surprise when the milkman kept chugging away.

26:27.320 --> 26:29.400
I have nipples, Greg. Could you milk me?

26:29.400 --> 26:31.480
I don't even think he was hiding it at one point.

26:31.480 --> 26:33.240
In one of his videos, he was quoted saying

26:33.240 --> 26:36.360
Hey there, I haven't made a video on Eugenia Cooney's weight in months.

26:36.360 --> 26:38.520
My videos on Eugenia Cooney always do very well.

26:38.520 --> 26:40.440
So as a person who's concerned about Eugenia's health,

26:40.440 --> 26:42.360
and a person who wants to make successful videos,

26:42.360 --> 26:44.680
I'd like to take the opportunity to publicly check up on her now.

26:44.680 --> 26:45.880
Really? What's wrong, Greg?

26:45.880 --> 26:47.720
Onision Judge is not hitting like it used to?

26:47.720 --> 26:50.040
Probably the most pivotal piece of evidence is when

26:50.040 --> 26:53.640
YouTube mass demonetized videos about Eugenia Cooney,

26:53.640 --> 26:58.520
and then Onision re-uploaded a video to another channel of his titled

26:58.520 --> 27:01.080
Please Help This YouTuber Heal.

27:01.080 --> 27:02.120
Not doing this for money.

27:02.120 --> 27:04.360
Many more Eugenia re-uploads later.

27:04.360 --> 27:07.400
She announces on Twitter that she is taking a break from social media

27:07.400 --> 27:09.320
and privately working with a doctor.

27:09.320 --> 27:11.160
Please respect that.

27:12.840 --> 27:14.200
You guys saved Eugenia.

27:14.200 --> 27:15.880
I may know who saved Eugenia.

27:15.880 --> 27:16.680
It wasn't me.

27:16.680 --> 27:19.240
How Eugenia Cooney will look after recovery.

27:19.240 --> 27:20.840
Those are some things I need to say.

27:20.840 --> 27:23.240
If you have anything positive you would like to say to Eugenia Cooney,

27:23.240 --> 27:26.360
please post it to the page where she can go to see nothing but supportive

27:26.360 --> 27:27.560
slash loving statements.

27:27.560 --> 27:29.080
Thanks to you and the awesome mods.

27:29.080 --> 27:31.560
I'm happy we're making a safe place for her and others.

27:31.560 --> 27:34.280
Yeah guys, please go tell Eugenia that you support her

27:35.000 --> 27:37.880
on my website's forums that have banner ads.

27:37.880 --> 27:38.600
It's to help her.

27:38.600 --> 27:39.160
Trust me.

27:39.160 --> 27:40.840
As usual, the rumors are not true.

27:40.840 --> 27:43.320
I am not making videos on Eugenia Cooney for money.

27:43.320 --> 27:45.720
This is an important topic that needs to be discussed.

27:45.720 --> 27:48.520
I have a Patreon to help me when my videos do not get monetized.

27:48.520 --> 27:49.720
I truly do care about her.

27:49.720 --> 27:51.320
As usual, I come with proof.

27:51.320 --> 27:57.320
His proof is a screenshot of only four videos out of this 60 he made

27:57.320 --> 27:59.000
that were dinged for demonetization.

27:59.000 --> 28:00.840
Here's seven reasons why this tweet is horrible.

28:00.840 --> 28:04.040
The number one thing you need to give an eating disorder is attention.

28:04.040 --> 28:06.440
Not making videos on Eugenia for money

28:06.440 --> 28:10.600
and not making money on Eugenia videos are two very different things, Greg.

28:10.600 --> 28:12.520
I've made a lot of videos about Eugenia Cooney.

28:12.520 --> 28:14.760
It seems you requested a review for one of your videos,

28:14.760 --> 28:17.880
and the only reason you would do that is in the attempt to monetize it.

28:17.880 --> 28:19.480
You just outed me yourself.

28:19.480 --> 28:22.040
It's very possible after you tweet this,

28:22.040 --> 28:26.040
you put in a review for the rest of the videos and maybe get them all monetized.

28:26.040 --> 28:27.400
Your argument is decimated.

28:27.400 --> 28:30.440
I have a Patreon to help me when my videos do not get monetized.

28:30.440 --> 28:32.280
Did you guys know I have a Patreon?

28:32.280 --> 28:33.960
Well, I mean, not anymore.

28:33.960 --> 28:35.480
Do I want your attention?

28:35.480 --> 28:36.760
Why even bring up Patreon?

28:36.760 --> 28:38.200
That hurts your claim, if anything.

28:38.200 --> 28:39.960
Guys, I'm not making these videos for money.

28:41.320 --> 28:43.000
I get my money from Patreon, so it doesn't matter.

28:43.000 --> 28:46.280
Being stupid means you lack intelligence or common sense.

28:46.280 --> 28:50.280
I might be mistaken on this one, but you should have a more recent video up

28:50.280 --> 28:52.760
that's not in this screenshot for some reason.

28:52.760 --> 28:55.000
You just put it out there even more.

28:55.000 --> 28:58.760
Just a week after this tweet, Onision listed 21 of his Eugenia videos

28:58.760 --> 29:00.920
because he didn't want his more negative videos.

29:00.920 --> 29:04.360
Still hanging over Eugenia's head as she dealt with her disorder privately.

29:04.360 --> 29:07.080
At least that's what I would have said if Greg wasn't a scummy hypocrite.

29:07.080 --> 29:10.600
He placed those 21 videos behind a paywall on his Patreon.

29:10.600 --> 29:11.880
Not doing this for the money.

29:11.880 --> 29:13.400
It's extremely gross at this point.

29:13.400 --> 29:18.760
Greg is literally taunting her with these re-uploads and these money-grubbing shenanigans.

29:18.760 --> 29:19.400
Don't worry, guys.

29:19.400 --> 29:23.240
He took them off his Patreon a month later after he already took everybody's money.

29:23.240 --> 29:26.040
After everybody went in there, took the videos and downloaded them.

29:26.040 --> 29:26.920
And he knows that.

29:26.920 --> 29:28.600
He knows that wasn't going to last long.

29:28.600 --> 29:29.960
He wanted the quick buck.

29:29.960 --> 29:34.200
This saga ends with videos like Eugenia Cooney's beautiful emails to me,

29:34.200 --> 29:35.800
where he basically emailed her saying,

29:35.800 --> 29:37.080
I wish the best for you.

29:37.080 --> 29:38.760
Sorry about those jokes in the past.

29:38.760 --> 29:40.280
All 600 of them.

29:40.280 --> 29:44.920
Sorry about accusing you of quite literally murdering kids because of your disorder.

29:44.920 --> 29:45.960
Dick move on my part.

29:45.960 --> 29:49.640
And Eugenia, being the nicest person alive, replies saying,

29:49.640 --> 29:53.400
Yeah, you should have really approached all of that differently, but thank you.

29:53.400 --> 29:55.480
And Greg cashes in two videos off of that.

29:55.480 --> 29:57.400
Did you just want more content, Greg?

29:57.400 --> 29:59.080
Or do you actually care now?

29:59.080 --> 29:59.880
We may never know.

29:59.880 --> 30:05.320
But what we do know is that the majority of Onision's Eugenia vids were made pre-adpocalypse.

30:05.320 --> 30:11.080
So he has made, I would assume, tens of thousands of dollars off of her situation.

30:11.080 --> 30:14.760
That is excluding the subscriber jumps that he most likely received from those videos,

30:14.760 --> 30:16.840
which then trickled views into his other videos,

30:16.840 --> 30:19.960
trickling money into his Patreon, trickling money into his merch.

30:19.960 --> 30:23.800
If Onision making 60 plus videos on Eugenia Cooney was not for money,

30:23.800 --> 30:27.480
then I guess the down payment on a mansion was just an unfortunate byproduct.

30:27.480 --> 30:30.760
Those videos that were made intended to help Eugenia Cooney

30:30.760 --> 30:33.000
get to rehab and start to rehabilitate.

30:33.000 --> 30:37.640
Eugenia Cooney has since gone to rehabilitation and is rehabilitating.

30:37.640 --> 30:43.240
Correlation does not imply causation, but whatever helps you sleep at night, Greg.

30:43.240 --> 30:44.840
Thank you, Mr. GG.

30:44.840 --> 30:45.480
What a G.

30:45.480 --> 30:58.680
So here we have a man who picks fights with half the YouTube community.

30:58.680 --> 31:02.600
Some of the most popular creators, including many of his former friends are Onision,

31:02.600 --> 31:05.080
not Mr. GG though, he might do too.

31:05.080 --> 31:10.440
Onision is provocative, offensive, unpleasant, and all around completely contradictory.

31:10.440 --> 31:14.520
You'd have a hard time pinpointing where his principles and beliefs often lie,

31:14.520 --> 31:17.240
owing the most loyal of fans would support him.

31:17.240 --> 31:20.440
But maybe that's the point, and I will elaborate.

31:20.440 --> 31:26.600
Many moons ago, I found myself for the first and only time stumbling across an Onision Speaks video.

31:26.600 --> 31:30.920
I can't really remember too much about it, but it was regarding some social rights,

31:30.920 --> 31:33.240
and on the whole, I remember agreeing with it.

31:33.240 --> 31:36.120
It seemed like a sincere appeal to humanity.

31:36.120 --> 31:40.360
Now, I didn't know much about him back then, but there are sprinkles of videos,

31:40.360 --> 31:44.440
given the volume of them, that will typically appeal to an audience.

31:44.440 --> 31:47.480
Onision embedded himself with certain behavioral characteristics

31:47.480 --> 31:49.960
which were tailored towards people who may be vulnerable.

31:49.960 --> 31:53.880
I'd identify four techniques that were very specific to what he created.

31:53.880 --> 31:56.600
Firstly, his nature speak directly to the view often.

31:56.600 --> 31:58.840
It allowed him to craft narratives that felt personal.

31:58.840 --> 32:01.640
It felt like he was speaking to you a lot of the time.

32:01.640 --> 32:03.240
That can be really endearing.

32:04.120 --> 32:05.480
You can still walk.

32:05.480 --> 32:06.760
You can still move your arms.

32:06.760 --> 32:07.720
You can still talk.

32:07.720 --> 32:09.240
You're very capable.

32:09.240 --> 32:10.520
You're emotionally damaged.

32:10.520 --> 32:11.000
So what?

32:11.000 --> 32:11.720
I am too.

32:12.280 --> 32:14.040
But that doesn't mean we just end it.

32:14.040 --> 32:15.400
That doesn't mean we just quit.

32:16.760 --> 32:17.880
There's hope for you.

32:17.880 --> 32:21.480
This allowed him to create a more personal connection with the viewers he resonated with,

32:21.480 --> 32:24.440
especially in environments where people may not have felt cared about.

32:24.440 --> 32:27.480
Just having someone talking to you like that can really make a difference.

32:28.040 --> 32:31.960
Secondly, his nature used a lot of language that one might class as compassionate,

32:31.960 --> 32:34.040
with a framing that may feel more rational.

32:34.040 --> 32:38.120
It appeals to people's emotions while giving them a security in the reasoning that he presents.

32:38.120 --> 32:40.120
I'm not saying this is a bad way of arguing.

32:40.120 --> 32:42.920
We can appeal to principles of morality a lot of the time through this,

32:42.920 --> 32:45.960
but it will definitely attract a certain type of audience.

32:45.960 --> 32:49.880
Because the relationship situation you find yourself in later on in life

32:49.880 --> 32:53.480
does not necessarily define your fucking sexuality,

32:53.480 --> 32:57.800
as sexuality doesn't necessarily have a whole lot to do with appearances.

32:57.800 --> 33:00.520
You're acting like just because I don't own a fucking castle,

33:00.520 --> 33:02.600
I'm not interested in owning a castle.

33:02.600 --> 33:05.880
Just because somebody isn't with a beautiful man or a beautiful woman

33:05.880 --> 33:09.480
doesn't mean they don't want to be with one or the other or both at the same time.

33:09.480 --> 33:11.400
Thirdly, he would appeal to an authority.

33:11.400 --> 33:12.440
Which authority?

33:12.440 --> 33:14.920
Well, himself, his experiences, his life.

33:14.920 --> 33:17.080
This would embolden him in the audience's mind.

33:17.080 --> 33:19.720
Now, we all appeal to our experiences from time to time,

33:19.720 --> 33:23.960
but he often did it in a very personal, revealing way, and he did it very often.

33:23.960 --> 33:27.560
The best I can tell you is to use your best judgment.

33:27.560 --> 33:31.960
When I deal with people who have cheat, I tend to disassociate myself with them

33:31.960 --> 33:37.800
because they don't really have any reason to have done it beyond their own perversions.

33:37.800 --> 33:39.960
So please decide for yourself what is best.

33:42.200 --> 33:44.440
And don't do what I've done in the past,

33:44.440 --> 33:47.080
where you forgive them for cheating.

33:47.960 --> 33:50.440
Finally, he wasn't perfect, but he knew it,

33:50.440 --> 33:52.760
and he knew his audience wasn't perfect either.

33:52.760 --> 33:55.160
He'd appeal to the beauty in the imperfection,

33:55.160 --> 33:57.240
being the outcast, the other people.

33:57.240 --> 33:58.680
He was your voice.

33:58.680 --> 34:01.960
Are the values of others so important that whenever you look in the mirror,

34:01.960 --> 34:03.720
all you see is what they tell you you are?

34:03.720 --> 34:06.280
Is the person you wish to be truly someone else?

34:06.280 --> 34:10.200
You want to decide your actions based on what you think others will think of you?

34:10.200 --> 34:12.600
Or would you rather live your life the way that you want to?

34:12.600 --> 34:14.440
When you discover who you truly are,

34:14.440 --> 34:17.160
when you finally decide to take on your dream,

34:17.160 --> 34:20.600
to live by what harms no one, what feels right to you,

34:20.600 --> 34:24.520
the ridicule and mockery you get from others becomes irrelevant.

34:24.520 --> 34:28.520
Once you have found who you are, once you discover the truth within yourself,

34:28.520 --> 34:31.560
no lies or corrupt persuasion can change who you are.

34:31.560 --> 34:33.880
They can't change who you wish to be.

34:33.880 --> 34:38.040
He could be confrontational, but he also could be sincere, soft, well-spoken.

34:38.120 --> 34:39.400
But his messages were clear.

34:39.400 --> 34:40.920
He wanted you to be stronger.

34:40.920 --> 34:41.640
He'd been there.

34:41.640 --> 34:45.080
He had been to the darkest places in the world and came out on top.

34:45.080 --> 34:47.160
His imperfections were your imperfections.

34:47.160 --> 34:50.920
He was as tortured as you, but you didn't have to let that hold you back.

34:50.920 --> 34:54.680
An idol is meant to be someone we can aspire to, but also someone we relate to,

34:54.680 --> 34:59.320
and Onision was crafting himself as the idol to the vulnerable, broken youth.

34:59.320 --> 35:03.560
He'd have all these opinions, but then he'd have this deep fleshed out backstory.

35:03.560 --> 35:06.600
He was this walking character study slash sitcom

35:06.600 --> 35:11.320
who would derive a lot of his opinions from his very serious experiences.

35:11.320 --> 35:15.160
But because of all his contradictory, destructive, hurtful behaviour,

35:15.160 --> 35:19.000
you'd have to lack some capacity and critical thinking to give him a pass,

35:19.000 --> 35:20.440
and yet some people did.

35:20.440 --> 35:23.480
In fact, in spite of this, he had a lot of devoted super fans,

35:23.480 --> 35:25.480
which is probably what he wanted.

35:25.480 --> 35:29.720
One of the tones that he has conveyed is a consistent distrust in authority,

35:29.720 --> 35:31.800
even those who might be qualified.

35:31.800 --> 35:35.800
And let me let you in on a secret, or at least a personal observation that I'm making.

35:35.880 --> 35:37.720
He wants to be the authority.

35:37.720 --> 35:41.560
Before Onision's YouTube venture, hopefully mentioned by a good friend earlier,

35:41.560 --> 35:43.400
he ran a site called Sesesca.

35:43.400 --> 35:47.560
I think this represents eventually what Onision wanted his channel to be.

35:47.560 --> 35:51.080
Sesesca was a religion that Greg started when he was 17,

35:51.080 --> 35:54.920
although he stated he had subscribed to the doctrine since he was 11.

35:54.920 --> 35:56.520
I personally find that unlikely,

35:56.520 --> 36:01.480
but hey ho, I think deciding the truth on such a statement would be a bit of a tangent.

36:01.560 --> 36:05.080
Sesesca as a concept had all these bizarre ideas

36:05.080 --> 36:08.280
that one might expect from a new start-up religion.

36:08.280 --> 36:11.480
Onision would regularly spend time in forums promoting the religion,

36:11.480 --> 36:15.400
sometimes acting as a follower, sometimes acting as a founder,

36:15.400 --> 36:17.160
maybe he was testing a response,

36:17.160 --> 36:20.680
or maybe he was just doing what he felt was the most socially beneficial.

36:20.680 --> 36:25.000
He also posted some emails he thought were of value from the site,

36:25.000 --> 36:28.440
including ones where he credits his sociopathic traits

36:28.440 --> 36:31.400
as giving him some form of god-like qualities.

36:31.400 --> 36:32.760
How very inspiring.

36:32.760 --> 36:35.880
There are many other highlights, but you can see it for yourself.

36:35.880 --> 36:37.800
In a way, it makes him a monster.

36:38.440 --> 36:41.080
In a way, it makes him a god.

36:42.360 --> 36:44.120
Now we may laugh at things like this,

36:44.120 --> 36:45.880
but the truth is that all over the world,

36:45.880 --> 36:50.680
cults like this are formed under the belief that the person at the helm is some sort of god.

36:50.680 --> 36:51.960
Onision knew that,

36:51.960 --> 36:56.200
and therefore tried to replicate the formula to create a cyber cult of sorts.

36:56.200 --> 36:59.960
Abuse of power within cults is often solicited when a person is roped in

36:59.960 --> 37:05.240
by an individual's charisma or sincerity or extensive wealth or any other values like that,

37:05.240 --> 37:09.240
but once they're in and once they have become indoctrinated with this belief system,

37:09.240 --> 37:14.200
they become often dependent on the cult leader, often financially and emotionally.

37:14.200 --> 37:17.080
This allows people in power to exploit that control.

37:17.080 --> 37:19.480
Creating a cult online has a few downsides,

37:19.480 --> 37:22.040
one of the biggest issues is physical proximity.

37:22.040 --> 37:27.000
When you're trying to escape a cult, it's not just mental entrapment, but physical.

37:27.000 --> 37:31.400
Even if it's not exactly a prison, the feeling that you may be chased or face a consequence,

37:31.400 --> 37:34.360
even worse if you get caught, is scary.

37:34.360 --> 37:38.040
If a cult leader has shown themselves to be capable of exploitation,

37:38.040 --> 37:40.680
who knows what lengths they'll go to maintain that.

37:40.680 --> 37:43.800
Obviously, although someone is not powerless over the internet,

37:43.800 --> 37:47.720
the window between people often gives them more control to make decisions

37:47.720 --> 37:51.160
that may help them distance themselves from controlling individuals.

37:51.160 --> 37:56.280
On top of this, it's hard to channel assets like charisma and sincerity into text form,

37:56.280 --> 38:00.520
so it made sense that actually Onision's YouTube channel worked better as a medium.

38:01.160 --> 38:03.000
To all you pro-lifers, I have a question.

38:05.960 --> 38:10.920
How many times do you need to be raped and impregnated before you figure out

38:12.920 --> 38:14.040
that having a choice

38:17.000 --> 38:19.880
may be a little bit more important than you originally thought?

38:19.880 --> 38:21.800
When you originally look on his channel,

38:21.800 --> 38:24.520
maybe you're met with one of the less atrocious takes,

38:24.520 --> 38:27.480
maybe you're met with something you feel passionately about,

38:27.480 --> 38:31.800
maybe you're in need of help and you're looking for a philosophy to latch onto.

38:31.800 --> 38:36.840
Onision isn't incredible, but he can communicate those feelings to a competent degree,

38:36.840 --> 38:39.640
and every now and then he'll say something that will resonate.

38:39.640 --> 38:43.480
Onision would talk about his personal life, his background, his time in the army,

38:43.480 --> 38:46.520
the time he almost took his own life, it's all very personal.

38:46.520 --> 38:50.040
He would talk about these experiences as if they weathered him in a way,

38:50.040 --> 38:52.040
and gave him some found wisdom.

38:53.000 --> 38:57.400
In my mind, the moment that gun was to my head, I stopped being afraid.

38:59.000 --> 39:00.440
I stopped caring.

39:00.440 --> 39:02.680
I've changed as a person since that day.

39:07.000 --> 39:10.760
Because now I feel like no matter what happens to me,

39:13.880 --> 39:16.760
I made it way further than I should have.

39:16.760 --> 39:20.920
The thing is, although I said there was no discernible explanation for his behavior,

39:20.920 --> 39:24.760
many people have created theories over the years, including Greg himself.

39:24.760 --> 39:29.560
For example, one situation where he diagnosed himself with Borderline Personality Disorder

39:29.560 --> 39:35.000
to explain his volatile moods in videos regarding a relationship with another person named Adrian.

39:35.000 --> 39:38.280
This explanation was actually initiated by one of Greg's viewers,

39:38.280 --> 39:41.640
and this led to a saga itself where he discussed it in a video.

39:43.000 --> 39:47.000
Hi, I just found out something great from an Onision.net member.

39:47.000 --> 39:49.160
I have Borderline Personality Disorder.

39:50.920 --> 39:52.120
So now we know the problem.

39:52.120 --> 39:56.040
Although he would denounce this four years later in another video claiming to be ignorant,

39:56.040 --> 40:00.600
it definitely represents these sort of fleeting explanations that many of his audience grapple at

40:00.600 --> 40:05.320
to justify and understand his behavior, and maybe even explain it themselves.

40:05.320 --> 40:09.640
In that situation, many more critical viewers have believed he was attempting to manipulate

40:09.640 --> 40:12.520
Adrian back into a relationship with his videos,

40:12.520 --> 40:16.680
before then scapegoating mental illness to avoid accountability for his behavior.

40:16.680 --> 40:20.760
But hey, at least he had that elaborate backstory in trouble and pain

40:20.760 --> 40:24.600
that reeled in so many people who felt like they knew him.

40:24.600 --> 40:27.480
Ladies and gentlemen, they really didn't.

40:28.120 --> 40:33.000
As mentioned, it was a guise so people would feel some sort of semblance of sympathy

40:33.000 --> 40:35.960
for all the terrible things he did over the few years.

40:35.960 --> 40:41.320
So before we go any further, I suggest we document the lies of Onision.

40:41.320 --> 40:44.280
But to do that, I brought my friend once again, Jay Aubrey.

40:45.160 --> 40:46.200
Take it away, my friend.

40:51.880 --> 40:55.160
It's been a good few months since I've gotten to speak my shit,

40:55.160 --> 40:58.360
but it seems Greg is just the gift that keeps on giving.

40:58.360 --> 41:02.920
What better way to ring in the new year than by revisiting our good pal, right?

41:02.920 --> 41:04.920
Looks like it's time for round two.

41:06.600 --> 41:11.800
When James asked me to cover the many lies of Onision, I really didn't think it was possible.

41:11.800 --> 41:14.920
I mean, with an online footprint as monumental as Greg's,

41:14.920 --> 41:19.160
keeping track of every intricate fable he's spun over the past decade

41:19.160 --> 41:21.640
is like stapling jello to a tree.

41:21.640 --> 41:27.000
But his rampant dishonesty does go on to further illustrate the type of creature we're dealing with.

41:27.000 --> 41:29.160
And with a timeline as clunky as this one,

41:29.160 --> 41:33.880
I suppose it's only right we try and keep everything as concise as humanly possible.

41:33.880 --> 41:35.960
Why don't we start at the beginning?

41:35.960 --> 41:41.720
I was brainwashed since a child to think that America was just the greatest place on earth

41:41.720 --> 41:45.720
and the Air Force is not full of nothing but elites, OK?

41:45.720 --> 41:49.400
Now, before I continue, I want you guys to know none of this is confidential information.

41:49.400 --> 41:52.280
OK, there are movies about how corrupt the military is.

41:52.280 --> 41:53.880
It's not new news.

41:53.880 --> 41:58.760
For years, Onision has used his veteran status to glorify his own image

41:58.760 --> 42:01.880
while simultaneously criticizing the U.S. military.

42:01.880 --> 42:04.840
According to Greg, he signed up for the United States Air Force

42:04.840 --> 42:08.600
when he was 19 years old in January 2005,

42:08.600 --> 42:11.480
not graduating boot camp until May of that year.

42:11.480 --> 42:14.040
He joined SCRE school the following day,

42:14.040 --> 42:17.160
but immediately dropped out after refusing to kill a rabbit

42:17.160 --> 42:21.320
before moving to San Antonio, Texas, to begin special training in August.

42:21.320 --> 42:26.040
He was finally deployed to South Korea before his honorable discharge in 2008,

42:26.040 --> 42:29.640
only it wasn't as honorable as he'd like it to be.

42:29.640 --> 42:30.280
Hey there.

42:30.280 --> 42:36.200
So as of late, there's been a bit of debate over what my discharge was from the U.S. Air Force.

42:36.200 --> 42:37.880
Somebody posted this to Twitter.

42:37.880 --> 42:40.040
I thought that was interesting that someone actually went digging

42:40.040 --> 42:42.920
to find out whatever documents are out there.

42:42.920 --> 42:45.960
See, Greg has tried to get discharged a couple of times.

42:45.960 --> 42:48.840
Apart from regularly uploading videos in uniform,

42:48.840 --> 42:52.200
he also tried to convince medical professionals he was depressed,

42:52.200 --> 42:54.760
along with stripping naked in his sergeant's office

42:54.760 --> 42:57.880
to prove he was human and, quote, not a robot.

42:57.880 --> 43:01.640
He got thrown in a cell and received an Article 15 for that little episode.

43:01.640 --> 43:04.280
Probably wouldn't warrant an honorable discharge, for sure.

43:04.280 --> 43:07.240
But Greg was adamant about this and proved his nobility

43:07.240 --> 43:10.200
by showing off some documents as evidence in a video.

43:10.200 --> 43:14.360
Sure enough, honorable was checked off, so everything seemed to add up.

43:14.360 --> 43:20.280
At least until 2017, when it became public knowledge that he received a general discharge.

43:20.280 --> 43:22.600
You guys imply that I wasn't discharged how I said I was.

43:22.600 --> 43:24.600
I wasn't discharged honorably in any way.

43:24.600 --> 43:28.920
And then you release a document that says I was discharged how I was described

43:28.920 --> 43:30.920
and that I was discharged under honorable conditions.

43:30.920 --> 43:32.120
And you know what? That's fine.

43:32.120 --> 43:35.000
If I was discharged generally under honorable conditions,

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
that is still literally honorable.

43:37.000 --> 43:38.680
By the title, it says honorable.

43:38.680 --> 43:42.040
Receiving a general discharge under honorable conditions

43:42.040 --> 43:44.520
is not the same as an honorable discharge.

43:44.520 --> 43:46.200
But you know that and you still don't care.

43:46.200 --> 43:50.600
With a discrepancy this minute, is there anything you won't lie about?

43:52.280 --> 43:56.360
I started a religion when I was 17 called Seska.

43:56.360 --> 43:57.560
Thank you for doing that, Dubbs.

43:58.440 --> 44:01.400
I started a religion when I was 17 called Seska.

44:01.400 --> 44:06.040
You know, if I had to guess, if I want to play this little religious game,

44:06.600 --> 44:10.360
I would go with the following theories that I'm going to express over the next few days.

44:10.360 --> 44:15.240
Since the young age of 11, Greg has denounced the teachings of the Christian church,

44:15.240 --> 44:20.680
turning away from the Bible and embracing a unique belief system of his own, dubbed Seska.

44:21.560 --> 44:26.120
But after being exposed for trying to turn it into a religion in 2006,

44:26.120 --> 44:28.920
Greg denied his affiliation with the ideology,

44:28.920 --> 44:32.680
deleting the website in a frivolous attempt to sweep the incident under the rug.

44:32.680 --> 44:35.720
Though unfortunately for you, Greg, you can't hide from me.

44:35.720 --> 44:40.120
According to the archived site, the lore behind Seska goes as follows.

44:40.120 --> 44:44.680
The earth creates all energy, humans come from the earth, humans are to protect the earth,

44:44.680 --> 44:47.720
and our bodies are used as shells to feed our spirits.

44:47.720 --> 44:52.840
Yeah, that's a rare glimpse into the mind of an 11 year old onion right there.

44:52.840 --> 44:58.600
The website originally stated that Seska found its way into millions of homes across the globe,

44:58.600 --> 45:01.480
until Greg later bumped that number down to thousands.

45:01.480 --> 45:04.760
Both, we can assume, were gross over-exaggerations meant to feed

45:04.760 --> 45:07.400
an already inflated sense of self-importance.

45:07.400 --> 45:12.360
Greg's religion would never meet its full potential, not only due to its insane principles,

45:12.360 --> 45:16.520
but also his ridiculously ego-driven attempts at recruitment.

45:16.520 --> 45:21.720
Outlined quite vividly in a 2005 email, where he depicts himself as a sociopathic,

45:21.720 --> 45:24.840
god-like figure in search of a loyal following.

45:24.840 --> 45:30.360
Seska would make a reappearance, however, under the religion tab of the Onision website in 2008,

45:30.360 --> 45:40.200
writing,

45:50.680 --> 45:55.880
Though this description barely lasted a year, disappearing from the website again before 2009.

45:55.880 --> 46:00.680
It was later revealed through public court records that Greg had filed to have his name

46:00.680 --> 46:05.160
legally changed to Seska at one point, perfectly demonstrating his mental

46:05.160 --> 46:09.800
follies and further illustrating the man's twisted perception of himself.

46:09.800 --> 46:12.920
A god whose omnipotence knows no bounds.

46:15.960 --> 46:21.000
Though in 2013 his mastery was challenged after being called out for another infamous

46:21.000 --> 46:23.960
controversy widely known as Turtle Gate.

46:23.960 --> 46:27.800
I just looked up tortoise, uh, what exact kind of tortoise I have.

46:27.800 --> 46:31.160
It's a Russian tortoise, not a desert tortoise, but guess what that means?

46:31.160 --> 46:35.240
It means that the basking temperature of a tortoise that I had, look it up,

46:35.240 --> 46:38.280
look up Russian tortoise, and you'll see a turtle that looked just like the,

46:38.280 --> 46:40.920
the tortoise I had, sorry, I just keep saying turtle, it's just easy.

46:40.920 --> 46:44.360
Anyway, Greg announced on Instagram the death of his Russian tortoise,

46:44.360 --> 46:48.920
Reptar, with a photo of a plastic bin laying upside down in his backyard.

46:48.920 --> 46:53.880
According to Greg, Reptar's death was not the result of heat or a lack of oxygen,

46:53.880 --> 46:57.800
but rather a panic attack likely induced by noisy neighbors,

46:57.800 --> 47:02.760
claiming it could not have overheated because he bought the tortoise under a heat lamp,

47:02.760 --> 47:06.360
disputing any claims of ignorance by playing victim and labeling his

47:06.360 --> 47:10.120
critics as hypocrites since most of them probably eat meat anyway.

47:10.120 --> 47:15.480
You guys owe me a fucking apology, you do, all y'all, all y'all smurfs,

47:15.560 --> 47:20.120
you don't even deserve names, you're just smurfs, okay, you smurfs, you owe me,

47:20.120 --> 47:25.080
you owe Onision an apology, I did not kill my tortoise, you want to know why?

47:25.080 --> 47:32.280
Because basking temperature for a tortoise is 95 motherfucking degrees, look it up motherfucker.

47:32.280 --> 47:36.760
But in case you think his consistent incompetence is anything other than purposeful,

47:36.760 --> 47:39.240
maybe you haven't heard about the wetlands.

47:39.240 --> 47:44.360
See, Onision's property in Washington is actually sitting on some pretty sizable wetlands,

47:44.360 --> 47:48.760
only he isn't allowed to do much with them, the law specifically prohibits him from damaging any

47:48.760 --> 47:53.400
of the land surrounding these bodies of water, which is why questions began to arise after his

47:53.400 --> 47:58.440
neighbors shot some footage of what looked like our friend doing just that. This wasn't confirmed,

47:58.440 --> 48:03.480
of course, until Greg literally filmed himself cutting down trees in his backyard after being

48:03.480 --> 48:08.360
explicitly told to stop, landing himself in some deep trouble with the law.

48:08.360 --> 48:13.160
And if you talk to your neighbors and the housing organization, then guess what,

48:13.160 --> 48:17.400
you wouldn't have gotten any fees and you would have been perfectly fine, they would have said,

48:17.400 --> 48:25.000
yes, clear these out, it is totally okay, but no, what you did was ignore the county coming to you

48:25.000 --> 48:29.640
and telling you that you can't do it, and then you rented a fucking bobcat and you're on video

48:29.640 --> 48:34.680
doing it, that's what they showed in court, literally a clip of you and a bobcat mowing

48:34.680 --> 48:38.840
down a tree. Seeing as the man isn't exactly the upstanding citizen he may claim to be,

48:38.840 --> 48:43.640
he later emphasized that he did nothing wrong during his process of, you know, breaking the

48:43.640 --> 48:47.960
law, but I guess it's all well and good because he still forces audience to pay for it, so I can't,

48:47.960 --> 48:52.520
what else is new? Long story short, to all my haters, I know you're useless, irrelevant,

48:52.520 --> 48:57.160
and wish you could be my boyfriend, but you can't, and I know that's why you hate me,

48:57.160 --> 49:00.840
so instead of flucking me, you'll just have to settle with my parting advice,

49:01.720 --> 49:08.120
you should fuck yourself, you should fuck yourself, you can't fuck me, so go fuck yourself,

49:08.840 --> 49:15.240
I am a god and you are peasant scum, so get a broomstick and fuck your own bum.

49:15.240 --> 49:19.480
Onision may not be the brightest crayon in the box when it comes to wetlands,

49:19.480 --> 49:24.120
but he sure could teach a master class in manipulation, there's not one thing that

49:24.120 --> 49:28.760
falls out of this cretin's mouth that you can take at face value, with his rampant

49:28.760 --> 49:33.960
deceit dating back literal decades, I'd sooner trust James to pay me, and we all know that's a

49:33.960 --> 49:40.120
stretch, but as one of YouTube's most prolific and notorious sociopaths, it'd be ridiculous of

49:40.120 --> 49:46.440
us to expect anything less than unbridled deception and overt immorality. Uh, I didn't

49:46.440 --> 49:52.440
bake my turtle, okay? That just was not, it's not possible to be hot enough, unless of course,

49:52.440 --> 49:57.480
putting him in a plastic tub outside, a large plastic tub that has air coming into it,

49:58.440 --> 50:02.840
and it has air coming into it, and if he wanted out, he could just dig, you know, because he's in,

50:02.840 --> 50:08.440
he's in dirt and, and grass, he could just, because they're digging turtles, those turtles dig.

50:08.440 --> 50:11.960
Anyway, oh, you didn't know that about the turtle either? You didn't know he's a digging turtle?

50:11.960 --> 50:16.120
You guys don't, you need to do your research, to, to quote you, you need to do your research.

50:16.120 --> 50:18.360
I was fucking right and you were fucking wrong, huh?

50:20.440 --> 50:24.200
You probably still think you're a good person deep down there somewhere.

50:24.200 --> 50:26.280
Idiots don't escape anything but reality.

50:27.880 --> 50:32.040
There's a phrase that money does not buy happiness.

50:32.040 --> 50:35.480
The thing is, with all these lies accounted for to many people,

50:35.480 --> 50:40.600
they weren't lies, even if there was evidence to prove otherwise, that's the point of a cult,

50:40.600 --> 50:45.400
people leave their reasoning at the door, and once he had that grip over a dedicated fan base,

50:45.400 --> 50:51.320
he could move in and take what he needed. Onision is like one of those badly worded spam emails,

50:51.320 --> 50:56.120
but in this instance, it's badly worded by design, so that only people who can't notice

50:56.120 --> 51:01.320
its insidious nature will be interested enough to fall for it, and once they've taken the bait,

51:01.320 --> 51:04.520
Onision moves in, like a crocodile.

51:08.600 --> 51:11.480
This can be observed over a number of methods.

51:11.480 --> 51:14.920
The first one, of course, is using his power to ask fans for favors.

51:14.920 --> 51:19.800
One of the most common in this regard, especially in the YouTube regard, is money.

51:19.800 --> 51:24.200
Now, I don't know how much money Onision has made, but he has three channels that

51:24.200 --> 51:29.240
have all approximately amassed 2 million subscribers each with a lot of views.

51:29.240 --> 51:34.520
Until very recently, he had a Patreon, he has his own website with ads, he sells books,

51:34.520 --> 51:40.120
songs, even an album. Now, I highly doubt that too much of his YouTube content is now monetized,

51:40.120 --> 51:43.720
and to be frank, for good reason, however, in a less sensorious time,

51:43.720 --> 51:45.960
I'm sure he was making more than enough.

51:45.960 --> 51:49.720
This is a guy who uploaded a lot, and I mean a lot.

51:49.720 --> 51:54.200
If you consider that at the peak he was uploading onto all three of his channels,

51:54.200 --> 51:58.360
in very short time periods, this was something he was heavily committed to,

51:58.360 --> 52:01.240
and then you have to count all the videos he's deleted as well.

52:01.240 --> 52:06.600
So it may come as a shock to many, when in 2017, Onision announced that actually,

52:06.600 --> 52:08.840
he was in a serious amount of debt.

52:08.840 --> 52:13.240
Onision's initial response, like all creators under stress, was to place his main channel

52:13.240 --> 52:17.640
behind a paywall. After this was met with annoyance from many fans, he once again flipped

52:17.640 --> 52:22.120
making an angry video telling people that their reluctance to support such content was because

52:22.120 --> 52:27.480
he was worthless to them, a classic guilt trip. He goes off on this massive diatribe about people

52:27.480 --> 52:31.240
stifling his dreams, he has truly lost his marbles.

52:31.240 --> 52:36.040
And what I've gotten from all this is, not only am I not worth 49 cents to a lot of you guys,

52:36.680 --> 52:40.360
but I never really had a real connection with a lot of you.

52:41.080 --> 52:45.640
It was always about you getting something out of watching me,

52:46.280 --> 52:50.600
and never about actually having a real bond with the person you're watching.

52:50.600 --> 52:57.240
It's frustrating that there's such a huge amount of entitlement on this site, and no realization

52:57.240 --> 53:02.200
or recognition for the person who's actually behind the camera, who's actually trying to

53:02.200 --> 53:06.280
follow their dreams, rather than just fall in line with everyone else.

53:06.280 --> 53:13.560
So when you look at the monetary aspect of $5.50 a year, or the 49 cents a month, it's not just

53:13.560 --> 53:18.680
money. This is you establishing that you're different than everyone else and that you can

53:18.680 --> 53:23.160
shell out half, is it a third of the candy bar? Is that a third of a candy bar that you'd be

53:23.160 --> 53:29.400
shelling out? That you could shell out that small fraction just to actually help somebody you care

53:29.400 --> 53:35.240
about, who you say you care about, survive the huge financial wall that's about to crush them.

53:35.240 --> 53:39.240
Obviously, this was a terrible way to respond, and people quickly picked up on that,

53:39.240 --> 53:42.760
and he had to change his tune, so he came back a month later,

53:42.760 --> 53:47.160
singing a different key, and explaining the situation in a bit more depth.

53:47.160 --> 53:51.480
Hey guys, I talked to the IRS today, and representative of taxaudit.com,

53:52.600 --> 53:58.600
and I got some really bad news, and the bad news is that there's certain tax laws that

53:59.560 --> 54:07.880
I did not know about, and one of these tax laws is telling you that you cannot deduct

54:07.880 --> 54:14.440
more than 1.29th of a business property acquisition each year.

54:14.440 --> 54:18.920
Now, initially, I didn't see anything threatening about this video. He opens up about his issue,

54:18.920 --> 54:23.080
takes responsibility, and appears to just be asked to be able to support if they can,

54:23.080 --> 54:27.960
which if he genuinely needed money, he could ask, and although I think anyone would be

54:27.960 --> 54:31.400
justified in telling him that this is his fault and he doesn't need any more money,

54:31.400 --> 54:36.120
if you actively enjoyed his content, then who am I to tell you what not to support?

54:36.120 --> 54:37.800
In that moment, at least.

54:37.800 --> 54:48.840
This is my screw-up. I screwed up hard. I wasn't educated on these taxes, and I used TurboTax,

54:48.840 --> 54:54.520
and I hoped that they would educate me on those, but TurboTax didn't have a pop-up dialogue that

54:54.520 --> 55:02.040
said, hey, when you claim this property, you can only do 1.29th of it. Never got a pop-up dialogue

55:02.040 --> 55:12.200
saying that, so it's a tough one. I do have a Patreon, patreon.com slash onision. You guys

55:12.200 --> 55:17.640
are keeping me going, especially now that we know I have at least $150,000 in debt.

55:17.640 --> 55:21.960
However, not too long after, he decides to go off on another diatribe blaming an app called

55:21.960 --> 55:26.520
TurboTax for telling him that it was unlikely he'd be audited before complaining about the

55:26.520 --> 55:28.760
society he does indeed live in.

55:28.760 --> 55:33.480
As for chances of me getting audited every single year, it was in the green.

55:33.480 --> 55:40.280
TurboTax told me that it was a very low chance of me getting audited, so never trusting TurboTax again,

55:40.280 --> 55:47.960
and surviving this is going to be rough, it's going to be heartbreaking, but this is the country we live in,

55:47.960 --> 55:50.680
and this is the government we're dealing with.

55:50.680 --> 55:55.960
Honestly, although I accept people can criticise the system while accepting personal responsibility,

55:55.960 --> 56:01.480
it's a necessary part of providing perspective, I just find his tone and structure rather unsettling.

56:01.480 --> 56:05.800
It gives me the impression that he's attempting to manipulate an audience into having the perception

56:05.800 --> 56:11.640
that on one hand, he's remorseful, and yet it's over something that's not his fault, it's society's.

56:11.640 --> 56:16.040
It's like he's trying to manipulate people into thinking he's wrongfully remorseful, and that he should

56:17.000 --> 56:22.440
He also released this weird video on his main channel, which seemed semi-ironic, but then had

56:22.440 --> 56:28.520
these very unironic statements directed at some of his exes, which I think confused the audience as much as me.

56:28.520 --> 56:36.600
I'm now making, you know, what normal people make, and I basically am feeling suicidal because of that.

56:36.600 --> 56:41.720
I recently went through a breakup, I dumped somebody, and they didn't worship me after, I don't know why.

56:42.680 --> 56:48.280
I think I have an STD, I didn't cheat on Lainey, I just somehow got an STD, even though Lainey doesn't have STDs.

56:50.040 --> 56:55.080
Still paying alimony, literally, that sucks. We divorced like six years ago, but you know,

56:55.080 --> 56:58.680
f*** me, right? My riding lawnmower's broken, donate today.

56:58.680 --> 57:03.560
Now, though that's my opinion on that set of videos, I'm willing to provide benefit of the doubt to a

57:03.560 --> 57:09.560
degree that people respond to distressing situations in an often irrational way. However, Onision wasn't

57:09.560 --> 57:14.840
finished with his crusade, and another situation which demonstrated this more clearly came into

57:14.840 --> 57:20.040
clutch, this relating to Onision's wetlands. Onision moved into another house in the last year,

57:20.040 --> 57:24.600
and decided that he wanted to clean out some unwanted content from these wetlands. Now, the

57:24.600 --> 57:30.600
wetlands were a protected area, so Onision was not allowed to make too many changes to the surrounding

57:30.600 --> 57:35.240
environment. In a legal document, it's reported that Onision wanted to clear the area for the

57:35.240 --> 57:39.720
purpose of having a clean view of the lake, but even after being warned, he persisted, and

57:39.720 --> 57:42.360
eventually concerned neighbors caught him on video.

57:43.720 --> 57:45.320
Onision's Dad So, category two wetland.

57:47.400 --> 57:51.400
There's a hundred foot buffer from the edge of the wetland for development.

57:53.240 --> 57:59.240
Need a permit at the very least, and mitigation for clearing.

58:00.280 --> 58:04.840
Now, there is no doubt after watching this that Onision acted recklessly, and has full

58:04.920 --> 58:09.880
responsibility. The documents show he had been warned at point of penalty, and he persisted.

58:09.880 --> 58:14.760
What exactly was the outcome? Well, we can't exactly be sure. We know that fines of up to

58:14.760 --> 58:19.800
$10,000 were threatened. However, in the final legal settlement, we do know that Onision was

58:19.800 --> 58:25.640
requested to replant all the damaged and removed items. So, after being called out by many people,

58:25.640 --> 58:30.200
clearly annoyed at his behavior, what does he do? Well, he obviously misframes the situation for a

58:30.200 --> 58:35.400
bit, but then in response to all this criticism, he starts a GoFundMe.

59:00.200 --> 59:17.800
Onision's Dad This GoFundMe also received pretty immediate

59:17.800 --> 59:22.680
backlash, and then in response, Onision turned into a bait and switch, claiming that he was

59:22.680 --> 59:26.520
baiting people into showing that they didn't actually care about the environment because

59:26.520 --> 59:30.600
they weren't actually concerned about his wetlands, and they didn't want to give him

59:30.600 --> 59:36.600
money to show them that they wanted it replanted. That is some A-Star grade logic there.

59:36.600 --> 59:41.240
Onision I didn't think anyone would donate. I was actually doing that whole thing just to make a

59:41.240 --> 59:45.880
point, and my point was kind of destroyed when some people started donating, so...

59:46.760 --> 59:51.640
I did get the joke, but I also feel the methodology was flawed. If he started a GoFundMe to prove that

59:51.640 --> 59:55.880
no one actually cared or could put their money where their mouth is, surely he'd have made it

59:55.880 --> 01:00:02.120
a more serious video to actually test people, and even then it fails as a concept. Anyone with

01:00:02.120 --> 01:00:06.760
basic reasoning skills would say that donating to the untrustworthy man's crowdfunding project

01:00:06.760 --> 01:00:11.400
to restore the garden that he destroyed would not be a good idea. Although masqueraded as a

01:00:11.400 --> 01:00:17.480
vague point, it was once again a desperate attempt to raise money, because he does not like losing

01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:22.680
it. He has more than enough money, no doubt about it, but he hates losing money, and around a similar

01:00:22.680 --> 01:00:27.160
time, it appeared he also started another GoFundMe which was for a new Onision forum,

01:00:27.160 --> 01:00:33.320
but that one is long gone. It's like a broken record running round, and round, and round.

01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:39.720
The real campaign is a message board. I have a message board that I want to fund. I really love

01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:45.160
forums and so forth, and I want to fund that. Onision doesn't want money because he needs it.

01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:51.240
Onision wants money as a statement of power, and he wants to see how loyal people are to him. He

01:00:51.240 --> 01:00:57.960
never wants to lose. It's a test of who really cares about him, not the wetlands. Onision has,

01:00:57.960 --> 01:01:02.920
and have, multiple videos up where he has lamented the little money he makes, and yet continues to

01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:06.840
live a life of reasonable wealth. Onision- Despite all this, despite this overwhelming debt that I

01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:11.880
cannot pay, I don't see how I could, because I don't see how any bank is going to give me $450,000

01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:16.680
as a loan or anything. If he cared about money as much as he claims to, he wouldn't behave so

01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:21.480
recklessly, but like a child, it's all about how much he can get away with with the audience,

01:01:21.480 --> 01:01:26.440
and see how they will excuse it. It's a power trip to him, and he's flying first class with

01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:31.160
a crowdfunded ticket, but this plane is about to take one deep dive.

01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:46.440
So Onision's pity party for favors is certainly part of how he plays with his audience's

01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:52.040
dependence on him. However, why would he stop there? There are multiple examples that have been

01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:57.000
documented in other people's videos for how he levies this control, but there are points that

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:02.520
many have argued this is pushed into rather perverse territory. Onision is a person who

01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:07.560
doesn't hide much, and when I say that about Onision, I mean it in the most troublesome sense.

01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:12.600
When I was working on a video for Jay Aubrey covering the relationship history of Onision,

01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:17.240
I realised that he projected a fair amount of fetishes onto his own channel.

01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:22.360
Onision. I'm coming for you. Jay Aubrey. Come to me. Onision. Almost there.

01:02:22.360 --> 01:02:30.760
Jay Aubrey. Wait, what? Onision. That's right, baby. Your lips taste like cherry.

01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:35.720
Jay Aubrey. Oh my god, no. Onision. This feels so right without whiskers. No more

01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:41.240
sandpaper except down there. Mmm, girl. This one is from when he was having a weird

01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:45.640
three-way relationship with two people who we'll cover in the next video. In a way,

01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:52.040
this is presented as a funny comedy video, but it's not. It's a cuck fantasy, and this is just the

01:02:52.040 --> 01:02:57.560
tip of the iceberg when we get down to it. There's a lot to talk about, but we'll start with the

01:02:57.560 --> 01:03:03.400
tamer stuff, which isn't saying much. So Onision has a third channel, a commentary channel.

01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:09.080
Uh-oh, bro. Such a nice name. Not satisfied with two channels, he started this little project in

01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:17.240
around 2012, centering around commentary. However, this channel was very strange. It posted on some

01:03:17.240 --> 01:03:23.400
instances very childish content, but also a lot less savory stuff. Now, obviously, we have the

01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:30.040
wonderful Onision forums, the wholesome oasis in the barren internet desert, and uh-oh, bro has a

01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:35.640
channel where people send him pictures of themselves, and he decides to rate them. This was also the same

01:03:35.640 --> 01:03:41.080
channel in which he took a test to find out if he was a pedo. Excellent optics, I must add.

01:03:41.080 --> 01:03:45.800
suggested I take a pedophile quiz, and I know a lot of you probably thought I would never take a pedophile

01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:51.160
quiz, but I think that idea is freaking hilarious, so I'm gonna do it. In fact, this channel is quite

01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:56.440
unpredictable in the tone, with many criticizing him for placing child-oriented content alongside

01:03:56.440 --> 01:04:01.160
much more mature uploads. Now, if a person has a range of interests, then they are more than

01:04:01.160 --> 01:04:05.800
welcome to express it, but I don't think those were his motives, so let's talk about this

01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:10.760
delightful rating system. In Onision's forum, he had a place where people could post pictures of

01:04:10.760 --> 01:04:17.080
themselves and ask to be rated. Now, I admittedly find the concept alone rather strange. I understand

01:04:17.080 --> 01:04:23.160
why people send pictures to be roasted, or complimented maybe, but to be rated by Onision,

01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:29.320
well, strikes me as a bit off, and Onision has a habit of making everything strangely personal,

01:04:29.320 --> 01:04:50.680
as always. And even unsettling.

01:04:59.320 --> 01:05:10.200
I'll add a minor caveat that those clips were from a video on his Onision Speaks channel,

01:05:10.200 --> 01:05:15.000
although he has done videos on both channels with similar tones, the comments from that video in

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:20.120
particular were just a personal favourite. I mean, if you gave it a passing glance, you may not see

01:05:20.120 --> 01:05:25.480
anything dangerous about it on principle, it's just with the context of his other work considered,

01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:31.240
he probably shouldn't be rating people, and with the latest clip, he's made it 100% clear he has no

01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:37.000
issue if they're underage. I'll be honest, I'm not exactly sure what barometer he's rating these

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:41.000
people on, I'm sure many of us have told other people they look good or they look nice as a good

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:45.400
compliment, as a way to maybe encourage them or provide them with confidence, but the sort of

01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:51.960
dynamic he's operating is slightly strange. He's a large creator, he knows his power, he knows he's

01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:56.680
gonna have a load of young fangirls who want to appear in these videos because he's popular.

01:05:57.240 --> 01:06:02.280
That was probably the major complaint relating to this content, this extended to individual cases,

01:06:02.280 --> 01:06:07.080
including a woman who claimed to be the sister of an 11 year old child who posted a picture in the

01:06:07.080 --> 01:06:11.800
forum to be rated. Onision states that he likes to keep his children off the internet due to

01:06:11.800 --> 01:06:17.000
these communities, and yet actively engages them when they're not his own. Despite knowing the risk

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:21.640
and the amount of creeps online who would take advantage of this sort of content, I dislike the

01:06:21.640 --> 01:06:26.440
whole dynamic, I think it's unhealthy, and I think given the context we're aware of, once again it

01:06:26.440 --> 01:06:31.800
was a power trip that Onision likes to feel control over his fan base, the idea that he can provide

01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:36.840
his personal approval to people and they can be recognised by him. I mean, of course Onision put

01:06:36.840 --> 01:06:41.400
out a condescending response video where he stated that the fact that he placed disclaimer in the

01:06:41.400 --> 01:06:47.080
forum stating it was 18 plus was, of course, reasonable precautions. Excluding his other

01:06:47.080 --> 01:06:52.760
comments that make it look very flimsy, people were not buying it at all, and people didn't

01:06:52.760 --> 01:06:58.360
think that Onision really had the protection of children at the centre of his heart.

01:06:58.360 --> 01:07:02.040
Onision- First off, I want to establish that the forum specifically stated 18 plus only, so if you

01:07:02.040 --> 01:07:06.360
submitted a photo and you're not 18 plus, you either weren't paying attention or you're a liar.

01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:13.240
Either way, shame on you. It's not just a simple thing, it's Onision taking what he can get, and as

01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:17.720
we know from his history, he doesn't have many limits, and he has curated an audience who will

01:07:17.720 --> 01:07:22.760
consent to him doing anything and supporting him through multiple controversies, and the fact that

01:07:22.760 --> 01:07:27.640
this sort of thing happened for years without anyone being able to take him down a notch was

01:07:27.640 --> 01:07:33.320
a testament to the commitment of many of his most dedicated audiences. Uh-oh bro seemed cultivated

01:07:33.320 --> 01:07:37.480
towards reeling children in with seemingly childish videos and then involving them in his

01:07:37.480 --> 01:07:45.160
much more mature rating game, and other videos of the sorts. It was a trap. Onision's sexual desires,

01:07:45.160 --> 01:07:50.760
paired with the immaturity of his tone on many of his videos, is a concerning combination for many

01:07:50.760 --> 01:07:56.680
apparent. It was Spider-Man and Elsa, but more subtle. However, the notion of subtlety had worn

01:07:56.680 --> 01:08:01.480
thin by 2019, as his Twitter became something else altogether.

01:08:07.080 --> 01:08:12.920
Hello everyone, my name is Fainted, and today the right opinion has kindly requested that I use my

01:08:12.920 --> 01:08:22.440
professional tweet reading skills to narrate some Onision tweets, and um, it's about to get pretty

01:08:22.440 --> 01:08:27.880
graphic. Just a warning. I don't care if you hate yourself after you masturbate to me, I just want

01:08:27.880 --> 01:08:34.600
you to be satisfied. Just woke up with an erection. Will you take care of it for me? We'll make you

01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:41.480
breakfast while you recover. Bro, give up on lesbians. They will never be into you. If they are,

01:08:41.480 --> 01:08:48.280
they're not lesbians. I need more cute British accents in my life. Well, this may be the video

01:08:48.280 --> 01:08:53.960
for you, my friend. We've got the right opinion. We got Fainted. What more could you want? I love the

01:08:53.960 --> 01:08:59.720
look in your eyes when you realize my baby is growing inside you. You know, I'm kind of over

01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:04.840
denying how incredible I am. Your screams of pleasure say it all. I wouldn't fuck you if I

01:09:04.840 --> 01:09:10.200
didn't think you were beautiful. I wouldn't come inside you if I didn't think it belonged in you.

01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:16.120
You were made to be fucked by me. Others may hate you, but they don't win unless you hate them.

01:09:17.080 --> 01:09:22.760
In other news, wanna give me a blowjob? They say when you have sex with someone, a piece of them

01:09:22.760 --> 01:09:28.840
follows you for life. I'm cool with that. Everyone has something beautiful about them. My best moments

01:09:28.840 --> 01:09:34.920
are spent unloading inside of you. Oh wow, I really hope my parents weren't listening when I was

01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:39.720
recording that. The true colors were showing, and people were starting to pay much more attention to

01:09:39.720 --> 01:09:46.360
his reckless behavior. But there was a lot of digging to do. Over the years, whether it was the

01:09:46.360 --> 01:09:59.800
lies, contradiction, infidelity, animal abuse, many people stood by him. But even worse, people went to

01:09:59.800 --> 01:10:05.640
him. I wish we were near the end, but we are not. And that's why you should join me in part two,

01:10:05.720 --> 01:10:10.760
where we talk about the individual cases, and the mentality of the man behind them.

01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:17.640
So yes, that was the video. I want to thank all my collaborators who've done such a fantastic job.

01:10:17.640 --> 01:10:23.800
Your contributions are greatly appreciated, and I'm sending my love to all of you. I don't really

01:10:23.800 --> 01:10:29.000
have too much else to add to this video. As said, stay tuned. Wanna give a big shout out to my

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:35.320
editors, my patreons, editors and patreons together. Imagine that, that would be wild.

01:10:35.320 --> 01:10:41.240
But yeah, my editors, check them all out. Patreons on the screen right now, I've got a few individual

01:10:41.240 --> 01:10:47.320
thanks to give. I wanna give a big shout out to my $50 patreons, Sam Hallabaloo, Nico Deschamps,

01:10:47.320 --> 01:10:54.040
and Caroline, and a very special thanks to my $100 patreons, Brandon and Stanton. Stanton's a new

01:10:54.040 --> 01:11:01.000
guy. Thank you again, Brandon's a classical OG, thank you too. If you wanna reach me, my Twitter

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:06.680
is at TheRightOpinion, Facebook, TheRightOpinionOfficial, Discord, in the pinned comment,

01:11:06.680 --> 01:11:12.280
Instagram as well. As said, I don't really have too much else to add, I'm gonna go die now,

01:11:12.280 --> 01:11:18.840
so I hope you guys stay tuned for when I re-emerge for part two. Hopefully not too long in the future,

01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:23.800
because I wanna keep everything on a relatively tight schedule. Thank you. So until then,

01:11:23.800 --> 01:11:27.160
I'm TheRightOpinion, and I will see you in the next one.
