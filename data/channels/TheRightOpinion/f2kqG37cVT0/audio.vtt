If you were hoping to see a simulated fight to the death, you've come to the wrong place.

00:04.280 --> 00:12.780
Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with

00:12.780 --> 00:17.680
too much free time, and today I look at a recent tax avoidance scandal.

00:17.680 --> 00:18.680
What fun.

00:18.680 --> 00:22.780
So it was recently revealed that Apple had cracked a sneaky deal with the Irish government,

00:22.780 --> 00:28.760
which supposedly enabled them to pay as little as 0.005% tax.

00:28.760 --> 00:33.720
Now the EU, obviously unhappy about this, have decided to take retrospective action

00:33.720 --> 00:37.520
and charge them £11 billion.

00:37.520 --> 00:40.840
£11 billion.

00:40.840 --> 00:45.040
Apple, obviously unhappy about this, have decided to try and hold the EU to ransom and

00:45.040 --> 00:47.680
threaten to take its business elsewhere.

00:47.680 --> 00:50.840
So let me declare points of interest before I take sides.

00:50.840 --> 00:53.920
I don't like the EU, and I don't like Apple.

00:53.920 --> 00:58.740
Apple tried to make as much money as possible at everyone else's expense, and the EU tried

00:58.740 --> 01:01.660
to make as much money as possible at everyone else's expense.

01:01.660 --> 01:04.180
So in fact, I'm not biased, I hate both of them.

01:04.180 --> 01:06.940
So who would I side with in this instance?

01:06.940 --> 01:08.740
The big business I don't like?

01:08.740 --> 01:11.340
Or the big establishment I don't like?

01:11.340 --> 01:12.940
Or maybe they're both twat.

01:12.940 --> 01:14.580
Well a lot of it depends really.

01:14.580 --> 01:19.500
Apple already- Apple already- Apple already- Apple already- Apple already claimed that

01:19.500 --> 01:24.500
the figures are in fact false, and the claims and accusations that the EU are making are

01:24.500 --> 01:26.540
complete bullshit.

01:26.540 --> 01:28.780
Obviously the EU claims the opposite.

01:28.780 --> 01:32.380
If the EU is found to be telling the truth, then I believe it is Apple's job to pay up

01:32.380 --> 01:37.700
as I believe decisive action in the area of tax avoidance has been long overdue.

01:37.700 --> 01:42.900
However if Apple is vindicated, then it will ruin a lot of people's trust in the EU, and

01:42.900 --> 01:47.780
demonstrate them as an aggressive institution who are attempting to exploit their power.

01:47.780 --> 01:51.920
But you don't want the politically correct bullshit, do you?

01:51.920 --> 01:54.800
You want me to say who I think is telling the truth.

01:54.800 --> 01:59.000
If I were to take a guess, I'd probably say Apple is bullshitting, although I cannot guarantee

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
anything.

02:00.000 --> 02:05.360
They wrote a really, really compelling, emotionally riveting argument explaining how they had

02:05.360 --> 02:11.560
transformed this flailing Irish town into the technical hub, and how this tax is an

02:11.560 --> 02:15.720
insult to their input all around the EU.

02:15.720 --> 02:18.600
It was a very well-written PR wet dream.

02:18.600 --> 02:22.340
I'll be angry if it isn't nominated for an Oscar this year.

02:22.340 --> 02:27.020
Should be told, I don't give a shit about your emotional and technical contribution.

02:27.020 --> 02:32.420
I care about your economical contribution, and if there's a law in place, that's a law.

02:32.420 --> 02:33.620
End of.

02:33.620 --> 02:37.400
Just because you're a large corporation doesn't mean you're above the law, or should be at

02:37.400 --> 02:39.240
least, you knobheads.

02:39.240 --> 02:44.120
The EU have been corporate pushovers forever, and now they're actually doing something,

02:44.120 --> 02:45.980
you have the nerve to stand against it?

02:45.980 --> 02:50.380
Whether the EU are embellishing the claims or not, there's definitely a lot of tax avoidance

02:50.380 --> 02:51.580
going around.

02:51.620 --> 02:56.820
However, it does reveal a more deeper, menacing problem in general than the EU has, the fact

02:56.820 --> 03:02.080
that certain agreements allow companies to transcend borders and sneak in nice deals

03:02.080 --> 03:05.740
with countries like Luxembourg and Liechtenstein.

03:05.740 --> 03:10.220
It's a sham, it really is, there has to be a new initiative that will make sure companies

03:10.220 --> 03:14.580
pay their relative tax in each country, because when you ignore those borders, then you're

03:14.580 --> 03:18.540
screwing over all the residents who use your product in their country.

03:18.540 --> 03:22.460
There are people who are actively making contributions to buy your product, and you're

03:22.460 --> 03:26.540
not giving anything back to the government in return to give to the people.

03:26.540 --> 03:29.060
It's a fucking disgrace.

03:29.060 --> 03:31.220
Cunts.

03:31.220 --> 03:37.380
If the EU, by some ice age in hell, attain the money, they should redistribute it to

03:37.380 --> 03:40.100
the countries that have been bloody ripped off due to this.

03:40.100 --> 03:45.020
If you are operating in that country, then you pay taxes in that company.

03:45.020 --> 03:47.460
It's fucking simple.

03:47.460 --> 03:48.460
But this is the problem.

03:48.460 --> 03:53.780
There are too many powerful lobbyists in institutions who will fight to overturn this decision,

03:53.780 --> 03:57.620
and there are too many politicians with no backbone who will not stand up for what is

03:57.620 --> 04:02.220
best for the public, which would obviously be to have Apple pay the money.

04:02.220 --> 04:07.860
So if you want my personal opinion, Apple, you twats, pay it.

04:07.860 --> 04:09.460
Convincing argument, I know.

04:09.460 --> 04:12.580
Anyway, I'm tired, and I'm going to bed.

04:12.580 --> 04:15.900
Even nocturnal, miserable old cunts need their beauty sleep.

04:17.460 --> 04:22.860
I'm the right opinion, and one bad apple is all you need to fuck up the whole bunch.
