0	4280	If you were hoping to see a simulated fight to the death, you've come to the wrong place.
4280	12780	Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with
12780	17680	too much free time, and today I look at a recent tax avoidance scandal.
17680	18680	What fun.
18680	22780	So it was recently revealed that Apple had cracked a sneaky deal with the Irish government,
22780	28760	which supposedly enabled them to pay as little as 0.005% tax.
28760	33720	Now the EU, obviously unhappy about this, have decided to take retrospective action
33720	37520	and charge them £11 billion.
37520	40840	£11 billion.
40840	45040	Apple, obviously unhappy about this, have decided to try and hold the EU to ransom and
45040	47680	threaten to take its business elsewhere.
47680	50840	So let me declare points of interest before I take sides.
50840	53920	I don't like the EU, and I don't like Apple.
53920	58740	Apple tried to make as much money as possible at everyone else's expense, and the EU tried
58740	61660	to make as much money as possible at everyone else's expense.
61660	64180	So in fact, I'm not biased, I hate both of them.
64180	66940	So who would I side with in this instance?
66940	68740	The big business I don't like?
68740	71340	Or the big establishment I don't like?
71340	72940	Or maybe they're both twat.
72940	74580	Well a lot of it depends really.
74580	79500	Apple already- Apple already- Apple already- Apple already- Apple already claimed that
79500	84500	the figures are in fact false, and the claims and accusations that the EU are making are
84500	86540	complete bullshit.
86540	88780	Obviously the EU claims the opposite.
88780	92380	If the EU is found to be telling the truth, then I believe it is Apple's job to pay up
92380	97700	as I believe decisive action in the area of tax avoidance has been long overdue.
97700	102900	However if Apple is vindicated, then it will ruin a lot of people's trust in the EU, and
102900	107780	demonstrate them as an aggressive institution who are attempting to exploit their power.
107780	111920	But you don't want the politically correct bullshit, do you?
111920	114800	You want me to say who I think is telling the truth.
114800	119000	If I were to take a guess, I'd probably say Apple is bullshitting, although I cannot guarantee
119000	120000	anything.
120000	125360	They wrote a really, really compelling, emotionally riveting argument explaining how they had
125360	131560	transformed this flailing Irish town into the technical hub, and how this tax is an
131560	135720	insult to their input all around the EU.
135720	138600	It was a very well-written PR wet dream.
138600	142340	I'll be angry if it isn't nominated for an Oscar this year.
142340	147020	Should be told, I don't give a shit about your emotional and technical contribution.
147020	152420	I care about your economical contribution, and if there's a law in place, that's a law.
152420	153620	End of.
153620	157400	Just because you're a large corporation doesn't mean you're above the law, or should be at
157400	159240	least, you knobheads.
159240	164120	The EU have been corporate pushovers forever, and now they're actually doing something,
164120	165980	you have the nerve to stand against it?
165980	170380	Whether the EU are embellishing the claims or not, there's definitely a lot of tax avoidance
170380	171580	going around.
171620	176820	However, it does reveal a more deeper, menacing problem in general than the EU has, the fact
176820	182080	that certain agreements allow companies to transcend borders and sneak in nice deals
182080	185740	with countries like Luxembourg and Liechtenstein.
185740	190220	It's a sham, it really is, there has to be a new initiative that will make sure companies
190220	194580	pay their relative tax in each country, because when you ignore those borders, then you're
194580	198540	screwing over all the residents who use your product in their country.
198540	202460	There are people who are actively making contributions to buy your product, and you're
202460	206540	not giving anything back to the government in return to give to the people.
206540	209060	It's a fucking disgrace.
209060	211220	Cunts.
211220	217380	If the EU, by some ice age in hell, attain the money, they should redistribute it to
217380	220100	the countries that have been bloody ripped off due to this.
220100	225020	If you are operating in that country, then you pay taxes in that company.
225020	227460	It's fucking simple.
227460	228460	But this is the problem.
228460	233780	There are too many powerful lobbyists in institutions who will fight to overturn this decision,
233780	237620	and there are too many politicians with no backbone who will not stand up for what is
237620	242220	best for the public, which would obviously be to have Apple pay the money.
242220	247860	So if you want my personal opinion, Apple, you twats, pay it.
247860	249460	Convincing argument, I know.
249460	252580	Anyway, I'm tired, and I'm going to bed.
252580	255900	Even nocturnal, miserable old cunts need their beauty sleep.
257460	262860	I'm the right opinion, and one bad apple is all you need to fuck up the whole bunch.
