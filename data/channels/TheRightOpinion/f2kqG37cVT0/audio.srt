00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,280
If you were hoping to see a simulated fight to the death, you've come to the wrong place.

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:12,780
Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with

3
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:17,680
too much free time, and today I look at a recent tax avoidance scandal.

4
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:18,680
What fun.

5
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:22,780
So it was recently revealed that Apple had cracked a sneaky deal with the Irish government,

6
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:28,760
which supposedly enabled them to pay as little as 0.005% tax.

7
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:33,720
Now the EU, obviously unhappy about this, have decided to take retrospective action

8
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:37,520
and charge them £11 billion.

9
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,840
£11 billion.

10
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:45,040
Apple, obviously unhappy about this, have decided to try and hold the EU to ransom and

11
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,680
threaten to take its business elsewhere.

12
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,840
So let me declare points of interest before I take sides.

13
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,920
I don't like the EU, and I don't like Apple.

14
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,740
Apple tried to make as much money as possible at everyone else's expense, and the EU tried

15
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:01,660
to make as much money as possible at everyone else's expense.

16
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:04,180
So in fact, I'm not biased, I hate both of them.

17
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:06,940
So who would I side with in this instance?

18
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:08,740
The big business I don't like?

19
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:11,340
Or the big establishment I don't like?

20
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:12,940
Or maybe they're both twat.

21
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:14,580
Well a lot of it depends really.

22
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:19,500
Apple already- Apple already- Apple already- Apple already- Apple already claimed that

23
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,500
the figures are in fact false, and the claims and accusations that the EU are making are

24
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,540
complete bullshit.

25
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:28,780
Obviously the EU claims the opposite.

26
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:32,380
If the EU is found to be telling the truth, then I believe it is Apple's job to pay up

27
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:37,700
as I believe decisive action in the area of tax avoidance has been long overdue.

28
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:42,900
However if Apple is vindicated, then it will ruin a lot of people's trust in the EU, and

29
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:47,780
demonstrate them as an aggressive institution who are attempting to exploit their power.

30
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:51,920
But you don't want the politically correct bullshit, do you?

31
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,800
You want me to say who I think is telling the truth.

32
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:59,000
If I were to take a guess, I'd probably say Apple is bullshitting, although I cannot guarantee

33
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
anything.

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,360
They wrote a really, really compelling, emotionally riveting argument explaining how they had

35
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:11,560
transformed this flailing Irish town into the technical hub, and how this tax is an

36
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:15,720
insult to their input all around the EU.

37
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,600
It was a very well-written PR wet dream.

38
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:22,340
I'll be angry if it isn't nominated for an Oscar this year.

39
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:27,020
Should be told, I don't give a shit about your emotional and technical contribution.

40
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:32,420
I care about your economical contribution, and if there's a law in place, that's a law.

41
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:33,620
End of.

42
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:37,400
Just because you're a large corporation doesn't mean you're above the law, or should be at

43
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,240
least, you knobheads.

44
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:44,120
The EU have been corporate pushovers forever, and now they're actually doing something,

45
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,980
you have the nerve to stand against it?

46
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:50,380
Whether the EU are embellishing the claims or not, there's definitely a lot of tax avoidance

47
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:51,580
going around.

48
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:56,820
However, it does reveal a more deeper, menacing problem in general than the EU has, the fact

49
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:02,080
that certain agreements allow companies to transcend borders and sneak in nice deals

50
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,740
with countries like Luxembourg and Liechtenstein.

51
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:10,220
It's a sham, it really is, there has to be a new initiative that will make sure companies

52
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:14,580
pay their relative tax in each country, because when you ignore those borders, then you're

53
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:18,540
screwing over all the residents who use your product in their country.

54
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:22,460
There are people who are actively making contributions to buy your product, and you're

55
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:26,540
not giving anything back to the government in return to give to the people.

56
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,060
It's a fucking disgrace.

57
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:31,220
Cunts.

58
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:37,380
If the EU, by some ice age in hell, attain the money, they should redistribute it to

59
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:40,100
the countries that have been bloody ripped off due to this.

60
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:45,020
If you are operating in that country, then you pay taxes in that company.

61
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:47,460
It's fucking simple.

62
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:48,460
But this is the problem.

63
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:53,780
There are too many powerful lobbyists in institutions who will fight to overturn this decision,

64
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:57,620
and there are too many politicians with no backbone who will not stand up for what is

65
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:02,220
best for the public, which would obviously be to have Apple pay the money.

66
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:07,860
So if you want my personal opinion, Apple, you twats, pay it.

67
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,460
Convincing argument, I know.

68
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:12,580
Anyway, I'm tired, and I'm going to bed.

69
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:15,900
Even nocturnal, miserable old cunts need their beauty sleep.

70
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:22,860
I'm the right opinion, and one bad apple is all you need to fuck up the whole bunch.
