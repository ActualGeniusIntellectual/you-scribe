00:00.000 --> 00:02.280
A very intriguing character study.

00:02.280 --> 00:11.360
Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with

00:11.360 --> 00:12.360
too much free time.

00:12.360 --> 00:15.360
And during December, I made a couple videos on net neutrality.

00:15.360 --> 00:19.480
After research, my feel was that net neutrality is not perfect, but I didn't trust the current

00:19.480 --> 00:22.880
FCC to repeal it while retaining many aspects that had been protected.

00:22.880 --> 00:27.200
I also felt like Ajit Pai was, to be honest, acting in a disgustingly contemptuous manner

00:27.200 --> 00:31.400
towards the public, basically mocking their concern and almost encouraging people to dislike

00:31.400 --> 00:32.400
him.

00:32.400 --> 00:36.200
If I was aware of what was going on in 2015, I would have been in a position where the

00:36.200 --> 00:39.800
advocates would have to convince me that net neutrality was worth introducing.

00:39.800 --> 00:43.680
I'm now in the position where advocates have to convince me that it is worth repealing.

00:43.680 --> 00:45.600
This is my approach and always has been.

00:45.600 --> 00:49.240
People know that I'm not one who holds onto the past, and typically embrace change if

00:49.240 --> 00:51.500
I believe it to be beneficial to the public.

00:51.500 --> 00:55.480
But if Ajit Pai, the man who is putting forward a case for repealing net neutrality, can't

00:55.480 --> 00:58.440
be bothered to put his case forward, then he can count me out.

00:58.440 --> 01:03.120
With the scandal surrounding multiple fake comments, it goes beyond ground-level arguments.

01:03.120 --> 01:04.120
Policy is trust.

01:04.120 --> 01:06.360
I do not trust them, so why would I trust their policy?

01:06.360 --> 01:09.880
However, many of my friends and supporters carried on sending me this one video, a video

01:09.880 --> 01:11.360
by someone called 1791L.

01:11.360 --> 01:15.680
Now, I had encountered this man once before on his video about H3 Productions and the

01:15.680 --> 01:19.240
Adpocalypse, a video that I considered interesting but slightly speculative.

01:19.240 --> 01:23.020
However, in his latest video, the tables are turned and he is the one calling out people

01:23.020 --> 01:27.220
for being far too hypothetical with their theories, as he dissects many of the net neutrality

01:27.220 --> 01:31.740
defenders and their arguments, yet I'm not head over heels for it like other people.

01:31.740 --> 01:34.820
So why are so many people assume this video as the definitive counter-narrative?

01:34.820 --> 01:37.020
Well, there are a fair few reasons.

01:37.020 --> 01:38.780
Let's start off with the most simple reason.

01:38.780 --> 01:39.780
The first is novelty.

01:39.780 --> 01:43.700
The fact that it goes against the mainstream narrative in an eloquent and competent manner

01:43.700 --> 01:47.740
means that people who are anti-net neutrality can finally have someone to reference other

01:47.740 --> 01:50.620
than a lot of the rather antagonistic arguments.

01:50.620 --> 01:55.660
1791L is not a millionaire Comcast owner nor a contrarian extremist, he is someone

01:55.660 --> 01:58.220
who is a lot more trustworthy than a lot of individuals.

01:58.220 --> 02:00.980
But what about the arguments themselves?

02:00.980 --> 02:01.980
Let's break them down.

02:01.980 --> 02:05.940
One of his favourites is the ever-reliable appeal to authority argument.

02:05.940 --> 02:09.340
In this video, he quotes a lot of figures who have been involved in the industry, giving

02:09.340 --> 02:10.780
it much more gravitas.

02:10.780 --> 02:14.620
Two things, however, can be pointed out with this approach, that there will always be figures

02:14.620 --> 02:18.380
of authority on both sides, I mean, just doing a bit of research, you can find plenty of

02:18.380 --> 02:22.900
individuals in similarly prominent and well-informed positions on the other side, there was in

02:22.900 --> 02:26.820
fact a letter co-signed by many pioneers in favour of net neutrality.

02:26.820 --> 02:31.740
I'm not here to wholly recreate a 1791L video because what he does is exceptional and he

02:31.740 --> 02:35.500
has to be given credit for his style, but there is nothing unique about the advocates

02:35.500 --> 02:40.020
he introduces, almost all the figures that he quotes are not exclusive in their position,

02:40.020 --> 02:43.700
and most of the arguments that are used in quoting are not exceptional of understanding

02:43.700 --> 02:47.540
to require such quotation, although they do serve as strong enforcement.

02:47.540 --> 02:51.220
This can, however, be linked to the second argument, how he presents each individual.

02:51.220 --> 02:54.940
By attaching numerous on-screen accolades to their names and using adjectives that empower

02:54.940 --> 02:58.200
their status, he successfully conveys their authority.

02:58.200 --> 03:02.540
This is what he does for people on his side of the argument, he only quotes a couple individuals

03:02.540 --> 03:06.300
of any status from the other side of the argument, one of them is John Oliver and I do not count

03:06.300 --> 03:11.460
him as an internet expert, however, he does quote Tim Wu, one of the creators of net neutrality,

03:11.460 --> 03:15.460
however with his presentation there is no list of accolades to his name, no shiny effects

03:15.460 --> 03:19.460
or filters that glamorise his attitude, however if you pulled up his Wikipedia page you'd

03:19.460 --> 03:23.540
notice that he is not just some chump and arguably just as prestigious as any other

03:23.540 --> 03:28.900
individual that 1791L pulls up, contrast to the person that immediately follows, the difference

03:28.900 --> 03:29.900
is stark.

03:29.900 --> 03:35.020
It's impressive framing and 1791L's effects are nothing short of fantastic, but presentation

03:35.020 --> 03:39.140
and points are two separate concepts, but it wouldn't be fair to say that nice presentation

03:39.140 --> 03:43.660
implies style over substance, because it doesn't, there is substance here, let's talk about

03:43.660 --> 03:44.660
that.

03:44.860 --> 03:51.380
1791L clearly values emphasis within argumentation, this is an emphasis in a rhetorical way, though

03:51.380 --> 03:55.420
he certainly has an impressive way of speaking, this is emphasis of points.

03:55.420 --> 03:59.780
Now this is important for the arguments because everyone seems to think that 1791L has dropped

03:59.780 --> 04:03.540
the mic for this debate, and I don't quite feel that, let me explain, well it's one thing

04:03.540 --> 04:08.740
to address net neutrality and another to discuss specific points, what do I mean in this instance?

04:08.740 --> 04:13.780
Well let me explain what my videos say, well as I said earlier I made two videos on net

04:13.780 --> 04:18.020
neutrality, I'm going to summarise the arguments of those videos, in bullet points, throttling

04:18.020 --> 04:21.780
of websites happened before net neutrality, the internet is very different now than it

04:21.780 --> 04:26.420
was in 1996 and therefore trying to say it was fine back in 1996 as justification to

04:26.420 --> 04:31.140
return such regulation is fallacious, idealistic free market competition can't occur in many

04:31.140 --> 04:35.500
places as many places only have one internet provider, the internet is doing fine right

04:35.500 --> 04:39.420
now if it ain't broke don't fix it, a majority of people are happy with it, the point of

04:39.420 --> 04:43.340
paid prioritisation was never sufficiently explained in how it would be defended, Ajit

04:43.340 --> 04:47.300
Pai has conducted himself terribly and not answered questions in an honest manner, companies

04:47.300 --> 04:51.460
like Comcast have behaved very suspiciously such as removing their paid prioritisation

04:51.460 --> 04:55.260
pledge on the same day that the initial intent to repeal net neutrality was announced, the

04:55.260 --> 04:59.100
suspicious activity has led me to have very little trust in their case for repealing net

04:59.100 --> 05:03.140
neutrality, concerned websites mean concerned people, passing over decision making to the

05:03.140 --> 05:08.060
FTC at the same time has probably contributed to a lack of clarity but it doesn't justify

05:08.060 --> 05:12.280
it, I have not seen enough evidence to suggest this is deregulation rather than just a shift

05:12.280 --> 05:16.500
in regulation and one that has more public implications, there is a need for clearer

05:16.500 --> 05:21.020
outcomes and more debate, people are overreacting and overreacting detracts from the general

05:21.020 --> 05:25.200
case for net neutrality but it doesn't mean that there are no legitimate arguments, how

05:25.200 --> 05:29.840
many points does he address? Let's talk about them top to bottom.

05:29.840 --> 05:34.740
As Tim Wu, a revered American lawmaker, professor, scholar in the tech industry and former senior

05:34.740 --> 05:39.460
advisor to the FCC wrote, Ajit Pai announces plans to eliminate even the most basic net

05:39.460 --> 05:43.960
neutrality protections, including the ban on blocking, replacing them with a transparency

05:43.960 --> 05:48.760
regime enforced by the Federal Trade Commission, transparency of course is a euphemism for

05:48.760 --> 05:53.180
doing nothing, the problem for Mr Pai is that government agencies are not free to abruptly

05:53.180 --> 05:57.540
reverse long standing rules on which many have relied without a good reason, such as

05:57.540 --> 06:02.380
a change in factual circumstances, a mere change in FCC ideology isn't enough, as the

06:02.380 --> 06:06.620
Supreme Court has said, a federal agency must examine the relevant data and articulate

06:06.620 --> 06:09.100
a satisfactory reason for its action.

06:09.100 --> 06:14.100
However, a study conducted by S. Derek Turner, an experienced free press researcher who regularly

06:14.100 --> 06:18.500
testifies before Congress and the FCC, found that in fact, ISP investments accelerated

06:18.500 --> 06:22.420
following the vote, investments in the edge, including those by online video providers

06:22.420 --> 06:27.180
and edge computing firms, are up as well, more new US over the top video services launched

06:27.180 --> 06:31.600
in the two years following the vote than in the seven years prior. Furthermore, the certainty

06:31.640 --> 06:35.560
that the FCC's action created spurred the entry of numerous pay TV full replacement

06:35.560 --> 06:41.280
providers with vertical carriers such as AT&T now distributing their pay TV services via

06:41.280 --> 06:45.800
other ISP's last mile networks. This evidence contradicts the FCC's claims that there is

06:45.800 --> 06:49.800
sufficient and objective evidence for the repeal of net neutrality.

06:49.800 --> 06:56.320
Everything just said is 100% real, and it sounds convincing to say the least, but that

06:56.320 --> 07:00.780
doesn't mean you should believe the inferences from it, and once again, it doesn't come down

07:00.820 --> 07:06.180
to what 1791-L says, what he says is not discredited, but just because he has a bit more finesse

07:06.180 --> 07:10.040
in what he makes doesn't make the base points completely impossible to challenge. He spends

07:10.040 --> 07:13.220
around seven minutes addressing two cases of alleged throttling, one of which is the

07:13.220 --> 07:17.300
Netflix case which is interesting so kudos there, and the other is bit taunt which I've

07:17.300 --> 07:20.580
never really mentioned and haven't seen too many others mention either.

07:20.580 --> 07:24.780
My basic points still stand, the FCC has not demonstrated that they have an agenda wholly

07:24.780 --> 07:28.820
compatible that can regulate against malignant throttling and pay prioritisation for me,

07:28.820 --> 07:33.260
and I have addressed that in my end of net neutrality video. One more point on 1791-L's

07:33.260 --> 07:38.420
video, he likes to describe the FCC as unelected, and the FTC as elected. This makes the FTC

07:38.420 --> 07:41.920
sound more democratic, when really the power balance is very indifferent between the two

07:41.920 --> 07:47.100
bodies, as the FTC is quote on quote elected by the Senate. Do not misinterpret his phrase

07:47.100 --> 07:51.740
as direct election from the people, it's not as democratic as he makes it sound.

07:51.740 --> 07:55.300
My second point isn't really responded to in his video, in fact it serves more of a

07:55.300 --> 07:59.380
response, albeit not direct to the internet was never neutral argument, and to prove that

07:59.380 --> 08:03.740
the gentleman he quotes David D. Clark was also quoted as talking fondly about the competition

08:03.740 --> 08:08.380
between companies, and given my next point that there is no competition for over 50%

08:08.380 --> 08:12.660
of consumers, yeah it's kind of indicative of how times have changed, especially given

08:12.660 --> 08:15.340
how that quote was only taken in 2009.

08:15.340 --> 08:19.500
The next point is kinda addressed, not completely. He says that just because the public likes

08:19.500 --> 08:24.160
something doesn't mean they can be trusted, that is true, but then he drops in a ridiculous

08:24.160 --> 08:28.000
analogy, citing that a majority of Americans can't even name the three main branches of

08:28.000 --> 08:31.680
American government, therefore how can they be trusted in being informed about net neutrality.

08:31.680 --> 08:35.760
This is a false equivalence, as people have different levels of knowledge about different

08:35.760 --> 08:39.320
things, and can be informed on an issue if the information is out there. The following

08:39.320 --> 08:43.520
example is an exaggeration, but I am using it to demonstrate why this point is false.

08:43.520 --> 08:47.560
I say well a majority of Americans do not know Pi to more than 5 places, so how can

08:47.560 --> 08:52.040
we expect them to know 5 squared is 25? They're both of similar difficulty but one is more

08:52.040 --> 08:55.760
functional. He then implies that there could be an overlap, implying that the public who

08:55.760 --> 08:58.520
are more informed about the structures of government could be the ones who are against

08:58.520 --> 09:04.000
net neutrality, and that is just an awful point, with no evidence to back up whatsoever,

09:04.000 --> 09:07.680
and it just seems like a cheap shot against people who are in favour of net neutrality.

09:07.680 --> 09:12.200
This is the only point in his video that pisses me off, public knowledge is not worth nothing

09:12.200 --> 09:17.560
even if they're not wholly informed. It can often say more about how you pass on information,

09:17.560 --> 09:19.120
wink wink agit pi.

09:19.120 --> 09:22.800
This leads on to my next two points, he doesn't address the one about paid prioritisation,

09:22.800 --> 09:26.520
but does cite evidence to suggest that it has happened in the past. However that mainly

09:26.520 --> 09:30.360
revolves around peering agreements, which is a different can of worms to me, concerns

09:30.360 --> 09:34.860
many circle the idea that ISPs may sanction off certain speeds and charge extra, but even

09:34.860 --> 09:39.120
if something has been the norm of the past, doesn't mean context can never change, and

09:39.120 --> 09:43.080
back to the competition point, or lack of competition point, it has changed. Then we

09:43.080 --> 09:47.820
have the point that agit pi has been a prick, and 1791L doesn't really address this, mainly

09:47.820 --> 09:51.380
because they're not necessarily to do with net neutrality, but to do with how it has

09:51.380 --> 09:52.380
been conducted.

09:52.380 --> 09:56.500
This is not to 1791L's discredit, I mean, he praises agit pi at the end of the video

09:56.500 --> 10:00.140
for his supposedly bold move, but it wouldn't have been such a bold move if he had been

10:00.140 --> 10:04.080
a bit more honest and upfront. He may have thrown himself into the minefield, but he

10:04.080 --> 10:08.320
has planted some of the mines. Even if there are no negative repercussions of the repeal

10:08.320 --> 10:12.280
of net neutrality whatsoever, I'm still going to be pissed off with agit pi because he has

10:12.280 --> 10:17.780
done a terrible job of communicating the implications. There is nothing courageous about what agit

10:17.820 --> 10:21.460
pi has done. I'm going to try and summarise the next few points, as this is going on much

10:21.460 --> 10:25.060
longer than I anticipated. The next point isn't addressed at all, mainly because it

10:25.060 --> 10:28.940
is fucking suspicious, but it's a small point admittedly. The next point is personal to

10:28.940 --> 10:33.980
me, the point following isn't addressed really, his only point about companies is that pro-neutrality,

10:33.980 --> 10:39.100
Twitter and Google etc have been pretty anti-free speech themselves, which is also kinda true,

10:39.100 --> 10:43.840
but whataboutism does not change the points around net neutrality. Once again, something

10:43.840 --> 10:48.400
being wrong over there doesn't suddenly make this being justified, and plenty of us have

10:48.400 --> 10:52.440
called out Google and Twitter for their behaviour. The next point isn't really addressed, I mean

10:52.440 --> 10:56.360
arguments are made for why it should be passed on to the FTC, and I'm not necessarily opposed

10:56.360 --> 11:01.320
to that either, but once again, as my little 1791L style excerpt asserted, there hasn't

11:01.320 --> 11:05.440
been a clear enough proof to show that the FTC will handle these with accordance to many

11:05.440 --> 11:09.640
people's concerns, and my point about regulation isn't really addressed, though it is more

11:09.640 --> 11:15.080
a conceptual point, so I wouldn't expect it to be. So what has 1791L done here? Although

11:15.080 --> 11:19.160
I don't disagree with a lot of the points he makes, the emphasis on presentation allows

11:19.160 --> 11:24.200
him to debunk points that although may be common in a way, are not necessarily completely

11:24.200 --> 11:29.680
representative of the arguments. Someone can be right for the wrong reasons. Now typically,

11:29.680 --> 11:33.080
if you were to present an argument in such a way, you would be advocating for the debate

11:33.080 --> 11:38.540
to be opened, and for real points to be addressed. This leads to my final two bullet points,

11:39.540 --> 11:44.540
and I wanted to use this to segue into my final point about 1791L and his success in

11:44.540 --> 11:48.580
conveying a message that he does. At the start he concedes that there should be a debate

11:48.580 --> 11:52.880
about net neutrality, but the public's perception is currently being skewed. Now this in effect

11:52.880 --> 11:56.460
leads to the extremes arising and concepts that are distorted, but it doesn't mean the

11:56.460 --> 12:00.780
real points are not there, and I agree with that wholeheartedly. After that disclaimer

12:00.780 --> 12:04.740
at the start, I assumed that would be also the concluding point of the video. Yet in

12:04.740 --> 12:09.380
the final phase of his thesis, the tone completely changes and he suddenly praises Ajit Pai for

12:09.380 --> 12:13.060
doing what he's doing, talk about how net neutrality ruins the market, and completely

12:13.060 --> 12:18.340
just talk shit about net neutrality activists, no evidence included, it's unbiased and completely

12:18.340 --> 12:22.660
out of character, it kinda caught me off guard. It's a hyperbolic ending to what could have

12:22.660 --> 12:26.860
been a fairly impartial video for just fact finding. Normally it would contain a summary

12:26.860 --> 12:30.840
of the points he made, but it doesn't, it's just Ajit Pai is right and net neutrality

12:30.840 --> 12:34.800
activists are off their rockers, the end. What happened to the debate? Why did he say

12:34.800 --> 12:38.640
that? The truth is he said it to provide the illusion of a conclusive argument, when really

12:38.640 --> 12:42.320
this is more food for thought, almost all his videos are, and yet for some people, they

12:42.320 --> 12:46.080
felt that this was the end of the debate. He had no right to say that, not unless he

12:46.080 --> 12:49.880
had gone through point for point in every single argument, which he didn't. He said

12:49.880 --> 12:54.340
that because it's much easier to open by conceding to the detractors that there is a necessity

12:54.340 --> 12:58.160
for debate and then acting like he shut it down, the end. It presents the illusion of

12:58.160 --> 13:01.700
impartiality when entering the topic and therefore having the final point come from

13:01.700 --> 13:05.760
such a strong place makes people trust it more than they probably should. I don't care

13:05.760 --> 13:09.320
too much what you take away from this video, you can think he's a genius to be honest,

13:09.320 --> 13:12.960
I think he does a pretty great job too, but do not believe for one moment that his video

13:12.960 --> 13:17.680
comes from an objective place, he's not claiming to make that video from an objective place,

13:17.680 --> 13:21.400
but the framing may present the illusion that it is, which is perhaps why people have been

13:21.400 --> 13:26.000
DMing me this video, left right and centre. It's an interesting piece, make no doubt about

13:26.000 --> 13:30.580
it. Truly exceptional in a way, but not definitive. I agree with a lot of what he says, these

13:30.580 --> 13:34.920
things should be done on a case by case basis, but I have to trust the rules those cases

13:34.920 --> 13:38.640
are going to be based on, and I didn't see that there in the video. What happened at

13:38.640 --> 13:42.440
the end of the video was a false dilemma, where a rejection of one argument led to the

13:42.440 --> 13:47.200
conclusion of another, excluding multiple other points that are being made. For example,

13:47.200 --> 13:50.880
he cites the FCC's fines and the fairness doctrine should imply that we should pass

13:50.880 --> 13:55.240
over power to the FTC before asserting that an evangelical president like Mike Pence could

13:55.240 --> 14:00.240
abuse such powers if they were in the FCC's hands attempting to persuade some of the liberals.

14:00.240 --> 14:04.040
Not only does he admit that the fairness doctrine has been out of action for over 60 years now

14:04.040 --> 14:07.680
with very few people wanting its return, and that Mike Pence was actually one of the people

14:07.680 --> 14:12.240
advocating against it, and that many fines were due to breaches of already in place regulations,

14:12.240 --> 14:17.160
but to imply somehow the FTC is the solution is another false dilemma. They're not absolved

14:17.160 --> 14:21.360
of their scandals, it's smart framing because a majority of people won't look into this,

14:21.360 --> 14:25.020
a majority of people will not look into these references in depth, but in a way because

14:25.020 --> 14:29.500
it challenged my beliefs, I had to. I wanted to finish on an article recommendation. When

14:29.500 --> 14:33.420
doing my research, I stumbled on one article that took out a lot of the extreme arguments

14:33.420 --> 14:38.180
and then put out a fairly formal, reasoned summary, which probably put the whole debate

14:38.180 --> 14:43.380
in a better way than anyone I know, myself included, did. The summary is on page two

14:43.380 --> 14:47.220
and the debunkment of the arguments are on page one. It's a little piece by someone called

14:47.220 --> 14:51.380
Kieran McCarthy who clearly has not been given enough credit for what is written because

14:51.380 --> 14:58.020
it is one of the best articles that I have read. 1791L's video is very crafty indeed,

14:58.020 --> 15:01.940
mainly because of its framing. Its arguments are not illegitimate, but they're not as affirmative

15:01.940 --> 15:06.380
as his outro may make it sound. When he opens talking about what sort of hypertrophic pill

15:06.380 --> 15:11.140
the public were taking, he is completely right. There is an overreaction, but that doesn't

15:11.140 --> 15:16.180
mean it's the only pro-net neutrality standpoint. The reason I did this was because I wanted

15:16.180 --> 15:20.300
a challenge. His arguments are well rooted, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't want to

15:20.300 --> 15:24.740
take away some sort of critical thinking from it, and I think I did, so I have to thank

15:24.740 --> 15:29.280
him for that. What are your thoughts? What do you think of 1791L's video? I'd love to

15:29.280 --> 15:33.300
hear down below. Let me know. Until then, I'm The Right Opinion and I'll see you in

15:33.300 --> 15:33.820
the next one.
