0	2280	A very intriguing character study.
2280	11360	Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with
11360	12360	too much free time.
12360	15360	And during December, I made a couple videos on net neutrality.
15360	19480	After research, my feel was that net neutrality is not perfect, but I didn't trust the current
19480	22880	FCC to repeal it while retaining many aspects that had been protected.
22880	27200	I also felt like Ajit Pai was, to be honest, acting in a disgustingly contemptuous manner
27200	31400	towards the public, basically mocking their concern and almost encouraging people to dislike
31400	32400	him.
32400	36200	If I was aware of what was going on in 2015, I would have been in a position where the
36200	39800	advocates would have to convince me that net neutrality was worth introducing.
39800	43680	I'm now in the position where advocates have to convince me that it is worth repealing.
43680	45600	This is my approach and always has been.
45600	49240	People know that I'm not one who holds onto the past, and typically embrace change if
49240	51500	I believe it to be beneficial to the public.
51500	55480	But if Ajit Pai, the man who is putting forward a case for repealing net neutrality, can't
55480	58440	be bothered to put his case forward, then he can count me out.
58440	63120	With the scandal surrounding multiple fake comments, it goes beyond ground-level arguments.
63120	64120	Policy is trust.
64120	66360	I do not trust them, so why would I trust their policy?
66360	69880	However, many of my friends and supporters carried on sending me this one video, a video
69880	71360	by someone called 1791L.
71360	75680	Now, I had encountered this man once before on his video about H3 Productions and the
75680	79240	Adpocalypse, a video that I considered interesting but slightly speculative.
79240	83020	However, in his latest video, the tables are turned and he is the one calling out people
83020	87220	for being far too hypothetical with their theories, as he dissects many of the net neutrality
87220	91740	defenders and their arguments, yet I'm not head over heels for it like other people.
91740	94820	So why are so many people assume this video as the definitive counter-narrative?
94820	97020	Well, there are a fair few reasons.
97020	98780	Let's start off with the most simple reason.
98780	99780	The first is novelty.
99780	103700	The fact that it goes against the mainstream narrative in an eloquent and competent manner
103700	107740	means that people who are anti-net neutrality can finally have someone to reference other
107740	110620	than a lot of the rather antagonistic arguments.
110620	115660	1791L is not a millionaire Comcast owner nor a contrarian extremist, he is someone
115660	118220	who is a lot more trustworthy than a lot of individuals.
118220	120980	But what about the arguments themselves?
120980	121980	Let's break them down.
121980	125940	One of his favourites is the ever-reliable appeal to authority argument.
125940	129340	In this video, he quotes a lot of figures who have been involved in the industry, giving
129340	130780	it much more gravitas.
130780	134620	Two things, however, can be pointed out with this approach, that there will always be figures
134620	138380	of authority on both sides, I mean, just doing a bit of research, you can find plenty of
138380	142900	individuals in similarly prominent and well-informed positions on the other side, there was in
142900	146820	fact a letter co-signed by many pioneers in favour of net neutrality.
146820	151740	I'm not here to wholly recreate a 1791L video because what he does is exceptional and he
151740	155500	has to be given credit for his style, but there is nothing unique about the advocates
155500	160020	he introduces, almost all the figures that he quotes are not exclusive in their position,
160020	163700	and most of the arguments that are used in quoting are not exceptional of understanding
163700	167540	to require such quotation, although they do serve as strong enforcement.
167540	171220	This can, however, be linked to the second argument, how he presents each individual.
171220	174940	By attaching numerous on-screen accolades to their names and using adjectives that empower
174940	178200	their status, he successfully conveys their authority.
178200	182540	This is what he does for people on his side of the argument, he only quotes a couple individuals
182540	186300	of any status from the other side of the argument, one of them is John Oliver and I do not count
186300	191460	him as an internet expert, however, he does quote Tim Wu, one of the creators of net neutrality,
191460	195460	however with his presentation there is no list of accolades to his name, no shiny effects
195460	199460	or filters that glamorise his attitude, however if you pulled up his Wikipedia page you'd
199460	203540	notice that he is not just some chump and arguably just as prestigious as any other
203540	208900	individual that 1791L pulls up, contrast to the person that immediately follows, the difference
208900	209900	is stark.
209900	215020	It's impressive framing and 1791L's effects are nothing short of fantastic, but presentation
215020	219140	and points are two separate concepts, but it wouldn't be fair to say that nice presentation
219140	223660	implies style over substance, because it doesn't, there is substance here, let's talk about
223660	224660	that.
224860	231380	1791L clearly values emphasis within argumentation, this is an emphasis in a rhetorical way, though
231380	235420	he certainly has an impressive way of speaking, this is emphasis of points.
235420	239780	Now this is important for the arguments because everyone seems to think that 1791L has dropped
239780	243540	the mic for this debate, and I don't quite feel that, let me explain, well it's one thing
243540	248740	to address net neutrality and another to discuss specific points, what do I mean in this instance?
248740	253780	Well let me explain what my videos say, well as I said earlier I made two videos on net
253780	258020	neutrality, I'm going to summarise the arguments of those videos, in bullet points, throttling
258020	261780	of websites happened before net neutrality, the internet is very different now than it
261780	266420	was in 1996 and therefore trying to say it was fine back in 1996 as justification to
266420	271140	return such regulation is fallacious, idealistic free market competition can't occur in many
271140	275500	places as many places only have one internet provider, the internet is doing fine right
275500	279420	now if it ain't broke don't fix it, a majority of people are happy with it, the point of
279420	283340	paid prioritisation was never sufficiently explained in how it would be defended, Ajit
283340	287300	Pai has conducted himself terribly and not answered questions in an honest manner, companies
287300	291460	like Comcast have behaved very suspiciously such as removing their paid prioritisation
291460	295260	pledge on the same day that the initial intent to repeal net neutrality was announced, the
295260	299100	suspicious activity has led me to have very little trust in their case for repealing net
299100	303140	neutrality, concerned websites mean concerned people, passing over decision making to the
303140	308060	FTC at the same time has probably contributed to a lack of clarity but it doesn't justify
308060	312280	it, I have not seen enough evidence to suggest this is deregulation rather than just a shift
312280	316500	in regulation and one that has more public implications, there is a need for clearer
316500	321020	outcomes and more debate, people are overreacting and overreacting detracts from the general
321020	325200	case for net neutrality but it doesn't mean that there are no legitimate arguments, how
325200	329840	many points does he address? Let's talk about them top to bottom.
329840	334740	As Tim Wu, a revered American lawmaker, professor, scholar in the tech industry and former senior
334740	339460	advisor to the FCC wrote, Ajit Pai announces plans to eliminate even the most basic net
339460	343960	neutrality protections, including the ban on blocking, replacing them with a transparency
343960	348760	regime enforced by the Federal Trade Commission, transparency of course is a euphemism for
348760	353180	doing nothing, the problem for Mr Pai is that government agencies are not free to abruptly
353180	357540	reverse long standing rules on which many have relied without a good reason, such as
357540	362380	a change in factual circumstances, a mere change in FCC ideology isn't enough, as the
362380	366620	Supreme Court has said, a federal agency must examine the relevant data and articulate
366620	369100	a satisfactory reason for its action.
369100	374100	However, a study conducted by S. Derek Turner, an experienced free press researcher who regularly
374100	378500	testifies before Congress and the FCC, found that in fact, ISP investments accelerated
378500	382420	following the vote, investments in the edge, including those by online video providers
382420	387180	and edge computing firms, are up as well, more new US over the top video services launched
387180	391600	in the two years following the vote than in the seven years prior. Furthermore, the certainty
391640	395560	that the FCC's action created spurred the entry of numerous pay TV full replacement
395560	401280	providers with vertical carriers such as AT&T now distributing their pay TV services via
401280	405800	other ISP's last mile networks. This evidence contradicts the FCC's claims that there is
405800	409800	sufficient and objective evidence for the repeal of net neutrality.
409800	416320	Everything just said is 100% real, and it sounds convincing to say the least, but that
416320	420780	doesn't mean you should believe the inferences from it, and once again, it doesn't come down
420820	426180	to what 1791-L says, what he says is not discredited, but just because he has a bit more finesse
426180	430040	in what he makes doesn't make the base points completely impossible to challenge. He spends
430040	433220	around seven minutes addressing two cases of alleged throttling, one of which is the
433220	437300	Netflix case which is interesting so kudos there, and the other is bit taunt which I've
437300	440580	never really mentioned and haven't seen too many others mention either.
440580	444780	My basic points still stand, the FCC has not demonstrated that they have an agenda wholly
444780	448820	compatible that can regulate against malignant throttling and pay prioritisation for me,
448820	453260	and I have addressed that in my end of net neutrality video. One more point on 1791-L's
453260	458420	video, he likes to describe the FCC as unelected, and the FTC as elected. This makes the FTC
458420	461920	sound more democratic, when really the power balance is very indifferent between the two
461920	467100	bodies, as the FTC is quote on quote elected by the Senate. Do not misinterpret his phrase
467100	471740	as direct election from the people, it's not as democratic as he makes it sound.
471740	475300	My second point isn't really responded to in his video, in fact it serves more of a
475300	479380	response, albeit not direct to the internet was never neutral argument, and to prove that
479380	483740	the gentleman he quotes David D. Clark was also quoted as talking fondly about the competition
483740	488380	between companies, and given my next point that there is no competition for over 50%
488380	492660	of consumers, yeah it's kind of indicative of how times have changed, especially given
492660	495340	how that quote was only taken in 2009.
495340	499500	The next point is kinda addressed, not completely. He says that just because the public likes
499500	504160	something doesn't mean they can be trusted, that is true, but then he drops in a ridiculous
504160	508000	analogy, citing that a majority of Americans can't even name the three main branches of
508000	511680	American government, therefore how can they be trusted in being informed about net neutrality.
511680	515760	This is a false equivalence, as people have different levels of knowledge about different
515760	519320	things, and can be informed on an issue if the information is out there. The following
519320	523520	example is an exaggeration, but I am using it to demonstrate why this point is false.
523520	527560	I say well a majority of Americans do not know Pi to more than 5 places, so how can
527560	532040	we expect them to know 5 squared is 25? They're both of similar difficulty but one is more
532040	535760	functional. He then implies that there could be an overlap, implying that the public who
535760	538520	are more informed about the structures of government could be the ones who are against
538520	544000	net neutrality, and that is just an awful point, with no evidence to back up whatsoever,
544000	547680	and it just seems like a cheap shot against people who are in favour of net neutrality.
547680	552200	This is the only point in his video that pisses me off, public knowledge is not worth nothing
552200	557560	even if they're not wholly informed. It can often say more about how you pass on information,
557560	559120	wink wink agit pi.
559120	562800	This leads on to my next two points, he doesn't address the one about paid prioritisation,
562800	566520	but does cite evidence to suggest that it has happened in the past. However that mainly
566520	570360	revolves around peering agreements, which is a different can of worms to me, concerns
570360	574860	many circle the idea that ISPs may sanction off certain speeds and charge extra, but even
574860	579120	if something has been the norm of the past, doesn't mean context can never change, and
579120	583080	back to the competition point, or lack of competition point, it has changed. Then we
583080	587820	have the point that agit pi has been a prick, and 1791L doesn't really address this, mainly
587820	591380	because they're not necessarily to do with net neutrality, but to do with how it has
591380	592380	been conducted.
592380	596500	This is not to 1791L's discredit, I mean, he praises agit pi at the end of the video
596500	600140	for his supposedly bold move, but it wouldn't have been such a bold move if he had been
600140	604080	a bit more honest and upfront. He may have thrown himself into the minefield, but he
604080	608320	has planted some of the mines. Even if there are no negative repercussions of the repeal
608320	612280	of net neutrality whatsoever, I'm still going to be pissed off with agit pi because he has
612280	617780	done a terrible job of communicating the implications. There is nothing courageous about what agit
617820	621460	pi has done. I'm going to try and summarise the next few points, as this is going on much
621460	625060	longer than I anticipated. The next point isn't addressed at all, mainly because it
625060	628940	is fucking suspicious, but it's a small point admittedly. The next point is personal to
628940	633980	me, the point following isn't addressed really, his only point about companies is that pro-neutrality,
633980	639100	Twitter and Google etc have been pretty anti-free speech themselves, which is also kinda true,
639100	643840	but whataboutism does not change the points around net neutrality. Once again, something
643840	648400	being wrong over there doesn't suddenly make this being justified, and plenty of us have
648400	652440	called out Google and Twitter for their behaviour. The next point isn't really addressed, I mean
652440	656360	arguments are made for why it should be passed on to the FTC, and I'm not necessarily opposed
656360	661320	to that either, but once again, as my little 1791L style excerpt asserted, there hasn't
661320	665440	been a clear enough proof to show that the FTC will handle these with accordance to many
665440	669640	people's concerns, and my point about regulation isn't really addressed, though it is more
669640	675080	a conceptual point, so I wouldn't expect it to be. So what has 1791L done here? Although
675080	679160	I don't disagree with a lot of the points he makes, the emphasis on presentation allows
679160	684200	him to debunk points that although may be common in a way, are not necessarily completely
684200	689680	representative of the arguments. Someone can be right for the wrong reasons. Now typically,
689680	693080	if you were to present an argument in such a way, you would be advocating for the debate
693080	698540	to be opened, and for real points to be addressed. This leads to my final two bullet points,
699540	704540	and I wanted to use this to segue into my final point about 1791L and his success in
704540	708580	conveying a message that he does. At the start he concedes that there should be a debate
708580	712880	about net neutrality, but the public's perception is currently being skewed. Now this in effect
712880	716460	leads to the extremes arising and concepts that are distorted, but it doesn't mean the
716460	720780	real points are not there, and I agree with that wholeheartedly. After that disclaimer
720780	724740	at the start, I assumed that would be also the concluding point of the video. Yet in
724740	729380	the final phase of his thesis, the tone completely changes and he suddenly praises Ajit Pai for
729380	733060	doing what he's doing, talk about how net neutrality ruins the market, and completely
733060	738340	just talk shit about net neutrality activists, no evidence included, it's unbiased and completely
738340	742660	out of character, it kinda caught me off guard. It's a hyperbolic ending to what could have
742660	746860	been a fairly impartial video for just fact finding. Normally it would contain a summary
746860	750840	of the points he made, but it doesn't, it's just Ajit Pai is right and net neutrality
750840	754800	activists are off their rockers, the end. What happened to the debate? Why did he say
754800	758640	that? The truth is he said it to provide the illusion of a conclusive argument, when really
758640	762320	this is more food for thought, almost all his videos are, and yet for some people, they
762320	766080	felt that this was the end of the debate. He had no right to say that, not unless he
766080	769880	had gone through point for point in every single argument, which he didn't. He said
769880	774340	that because it's much easier to open by conceding to the detractors that there is a necessity
774340	778160	for debate and then acting like he shut it down, the end. It presents the illusion of
778160	781700	impartiality when entering the topic and therefore having the final point come from
781700	785760	such a strong place makes people trust it more than they probably should. I don't care
785760	789320	too much what you take away from this video, you can think he's a genius to be honest,
789320	792960	I think he does a pretty great job too, but do not believe for one moment that his video
792960	797680	comes from an objective place, he's not claiming to make that video from an objective place,
797680	801400	but the framing may present the illusion that it is, which is perhaps why people have been
801400	806000	DMing me this video, left right and centre. It's an interesting piece, make no doubt about
806000	810580	it. Truly exceptional in a way, but not definitive. I agree with a lot of what he says, these
810580	814920	things should be done on a case by case basis, but I have to trust the rules those cases
814920	818640	are going to be based on, and I didn't see that there in the video. What happened at
818640	822440	the end of the video was a false dilemma, where a rejection of one argument led to the
822440	827200	conclusion of another, excluding multiple other points that are being made. For example,
827200	830880	he cites the FCC's fines and the fairness doctrine should imply that we should pass
830880	835240	over power to the FTC before asserting that an evangelical president like Mike Pence could
835240	840240	abuse such powers if they were in the FCC's hands attempting to persuade some of the liberals.
840240	844040	Not only does he admit that the fairness doctrine has been out of action for over 60 years now
844040	847680	with very few people wanting its return, and that Mike Pence was actually one of the people
847680	852240	advocating against it, and that many fines were due to breaches of already in place regulations,
852240	857160	but to imply somehow the FTC is the solution is another false dilemma. They're not absolved
857160	861360	of their scandals, it's smart framing because a majority of people won't look into this,
861360	865020	a majority of people will not look into these references in depth, but in a way because
865020	869500	it challenged my beliefs, I had to. I wanted to finish on an article recommendation. When
869500	873420	doing my research, I stumbled on one article that took out a lot of the extreme arguments
873420	878180	and then put out a fairly formal, reasoned summary, which probably put the whole debate
878180	883380	in a better way than anyone I know, myself included, did. The summary is on page two
883380	887220	and the debunkment of the arguments are on page one. It's a little piece by someone called
887220	891380	Kieran McCarthy who clearly has not been given enough credit for what is written because
891380	898020	it is one of the best articles that I have read. 1791L's video is very crafty indeed,
898020	901940	mainly because of its framing. Its arguments are not illegitimate, but they're not as affirmative
901940	906380	as his outro may make it sound. When he opens talking about what sort of hypertrophic pill
906380	911140	the public were taking, he is completely right. There is an overreaction, but that doesn't
911140	916180	mean it's the only pro-net neutrality standpoint. The reason I did this was because I wanted
916180	920300	a challenge. His arguments are well rooted, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't want to
920300	924740	take away some sort of critical thinking from it, and I think I did, so I have to thank
924740	929280	him for that. What are your thoughts? What do you think of 1791L's video? I'd love to
929280	933300	hear down below. Let me know. Until then, I'm The Right Opinion and I'll see you in
933300	933820	the next one.
