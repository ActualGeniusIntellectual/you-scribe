1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,480
Let's talk about a more personal subject.

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,080
Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time.

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:17,200
And today we're going to be talking about poetry, and how it influenced my creativity and me as a person.

4
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:22,840
Now many of you will be thinking right now, hang on Mr Right Opinion, this isn't a spicy take on the latest hot topic,

5
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,240
this is story time with the right mongo.

6
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:28,440
Well I'm here today by request, and a request that I'm very grateful of,

7
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,720
and I'll expand on that at the end of the video, just not right now so I don't make it too clunky.

8
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,800
But first, let's hop in the time machine and go back to a past,

9
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,960
a past where The Right Opinion wasn't a miserable, cynical student,

10
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,560
and actually had a mildly positive outlook on the world.

11
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:46,800
I mean, I always really hated it, but still a time where I was more readily excited at prospects.

12
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,280
It was school, I was in what the British regard as Year 5,

13
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:55,440
which for any of you fellows across the pond, or any country that doesn't use the rather peculiar British interpretation,

14
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,640
is the 4th grade.

15
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,480
Now Year 5 was a very interesting year for me, it was only the year that I had the most behavioural challenges.

16
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:06,440
When I was young, I had a very hot-headed nature, I was prone to erupting unnecessarily,

17
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,800
and it didn't make me a particularly popular person.

18
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:12,080
A lot of that stress was rooted in the fact that I'd always felt excluded,

19
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,800
and everyone had been antagonistic to me in a way, they gave me a reputation,

20
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:19,120
and I, being the foolish individual, chose to conform to it.

21
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:24,640
A real problem for me at that age was the fact that I had very little opportunity to release a lot of my own personal battles

22
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,840
that were occurring inside my ever-active mind.

23
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:32,080
However, one day I had an English class, an English class that I made the active decision to pay attention in for once,

24
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:36,000
and in this lesson, the tutor introduced us to five conceptual devices of poetry.

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,760
Now, this was new to me, and I hope this is probably not new to you now,

26
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,800
but if I recall correctly, I do remember them.

27
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:45,520
They were alliteration, onomatopoeia, simile, metaphor, and imagery.

28
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,520
These were new concepts to me, but as I said, they still stick in my head to this day,

29
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:54,000
because they were what started the foundations of my scripts, my lyrics, and my poetry.

30
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,560
And we're gonna be focusing on the poetry at first here,

31
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,640
because poetry was the first time I was ever able to exercise those newfound devices,

32
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,600
and I still remember it to this day, which is unique in a way, because I'm not a proactive student,

33
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,440
I'm not someone who works to please any more than beyond exam results,

34
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,320
and this poem was no exam, to me it could have been another throwaway task,

35
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,840
and yet when I wrote it, people were really impressed.

36
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:22,000
The teacher gave me great praise, and my parents supposedly ran it online to check I hadn't plagiarised it,

37
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,240
yet to me it was another standard task, and I guess at that moment,

38
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:30,840
I realised I did have a rhetorical talent that I could wield, unlike many other devices.

39
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:36,360
It was the first time that I managed to stem a lot of my creativity and thoughts into this new technique,

40
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:40,120
and it pushed a lot of my pent up pain and internal troubles out.

41
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:45,880
And in a way, it did get better, life felt nicer when I was venting and putting down my emotions on a page,

42
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:50,200
there is something liberating about it, and turning it into something that reflects you as a person,

43
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:53,320
even if not everyone approves of that person that you project,

44
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:58,400
and I think I still call on these memories because they're the foundations that are still steady to this day.

45
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:04,640
When you let that creativity become part of you, it's a lot harder to let it go, it's not just general knowledge anymore.

46
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,520
I did speech and drama, and you can probably tell that with my dramatic inflections,

47
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:11,880
but I never read poetry, most of all I never learned poetry,

48
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:15,360
that's the thing, I think that true poetry isn't something that can be learned,

49
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,560
you learn the principles and the basics, but the rest is up to you,

50
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,840
to turn it into something creative, and that creativity that such a task can drive,

51
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:26,760
that is something that spills over into every written persuasion you choose to embark in.

52
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:31,440
My favourite poem at that age was a Roald Dahl spin on the Little Red Riding Hood tale,

53
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,080
when I was partaking in many activities, I was still a boy,

54
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,520
but when I picked up that pen, I became a man.

55
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:41,760
Those principles, simile, metaphor, alliteration, imagery, and onomatopoeia,

56
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,640
particularly the first three, they do not need introduction or explanation,

57
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,280
if you are not privy with their definitions, you can look them up,

58
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:51,480
but I'll probably have them up on screen anyway, because I'm a pushover.

59
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:54,200
The poem I wrote back then was about a shed,

60
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,760
I can still remember the outdated Microsoft Word background I slapped on it,

61
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,760
when I used a background image from Google search of a shed with grass in front of it,

62
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:06,000
with the characters outlining everything I put in that shed, and how it represented me,

63
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,880
and in a way that exercise itself was unique, because it helped me build a bond with the poem,

64
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:14,920
with what I was writing, and how I wanted to express myself as a person,

65
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,720
by integrating my own personality within it.

66
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:21,800
And I guess that's the first time I felt a spark for writing, like I never had before,

67
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:25,880
it was not the first time I'd written something, it was not the first time I'd written even a poem,

68
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:28,320
it was the first time that I cared about a product though,

69
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,600
it was the first thing that I ever got credit for, that didn't take excessive amounts of time,

70
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,120
it was something that came naturally to me, and it felt right.

71
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:40,280
From there, I have taken it in many directions, I've written movie scripts, I've written songs,

72
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:44,800
and now I'm here, writing YouTube videos, and it all came from writing a poem essentially,

73
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,640
and that's because poems are the best way to pick up these techniques in many ways,

74
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:53,040
because you're trying to articulate something in a structurally and expressively elevated way,

75
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,360
and you're introduced to these concepts that mould your subconscious with another simulation,

76
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,880
it's a way that has been therapeutic and beneficial to my technique and style,

77
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:06,080
and so when I felt it right to return to my writing roots after years of hiatus,

78
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,080
wanting to do a simple script for a YouTube video, it never deserted me,

79
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,280
and it is the reason why I'm here today.

80
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:16,560
There are many times when I've sought to offset pain, the feeling of helplessness in this world,

81
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,000
which is why this channel exists in a way, but through it all, I'm glad it does,

82
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,320
because it has helped me through those times like many other things just couldn't,

83
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,520
and out of all the things I'm thankful for, I'm thankful for picking up a pen in year 5

84
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:32,440
and writing a poem that bonded to me as a writer and as a human being.

85
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:37,160
There is so much that a simple line, a simple phrase can cause, so if you're stuck for inspiration,

86
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:41,520
if you're looking for that spark to turn into a creative wildfire, do some digging,

87
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:46,320
learn some devices and apply them, whether it's a poem, song or script, give it your best shot.

88
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,520
In my opinion, poetry is a great way to enter the writing game,

89
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:54,040
because you can project yourself on a page and you can use a lot of these devices.

90
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:59,200
It's a brilliant way to discover oneself and to express it in new and unique approaches.

91
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:04,920
I know this is going to be a bit of a transition, but the reason this video exists was for a Patreon,

92
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:09,320
Licorice Pepsi, who made the very generous donation of $20 at the turn of January.

93
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:14,200
I'm very grateful for her kindness, as she has been exceptionally amenable and fantastic to talk to as well,

94
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:17,280
a great person all round. If you want to get involved with my Patreon,

95
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,080
then I'll put a link at the end of the video and in the description.

96
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,520
I know this is a slightly different video, but I hope you enjoyed it nonetheless,

97
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,840
one that was certainly more sentimental and a calm turn from the normal right opinion.

98
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:33,520
Did you enjoy it? I'd love to hear. Until then, I'm The Right Opinion, and I'll see you in the next one.

99
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:46,640
Thanks for watching!
