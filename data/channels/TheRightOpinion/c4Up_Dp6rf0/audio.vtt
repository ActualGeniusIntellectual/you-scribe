00:00.000 --> 00:02.480
Let's talk about a more personal subject.

00:08.080 --> 00:12.080
Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time.

00:12.080 --> 00:17.200
And today we're going to be talking about poetry, and how it influenced my creativity and me as a person.

00:17.200 --> 00:22.840
Now many of you will be thinking right now, hang on Mr Right Opinion, this isn't a spicy take on the latest hot topic,

00:22.840 --> 00:25.240
this is story time with the right mongo.

00:25.240 --> 00:28.440
Well I'm here today by request, and a request that I'm very grateful of,

00:28.440 --> 00:32.720
and I'll expand on that at the end of the video, just not right now so I don't make it too clunky.

00:32.720 --> 00:35.800
But first, let's hop in the time machine and go back to a past,

00:35.800 --> 00:38.960
a past where The Right Opinion wasn't a miserable, cynical student,

00:38.960 --> 00:41.560
and actually had a mildly positive outlook on the world.

00:41.560 --> 00:46.800
I mean, I always really hated it, but still a time where I was more readily excited at prospects.

00:46.800 --> 00:50.280
It was school, I was in what the British regard as Year 5,

00:50.280 --> 00:55.440
which for any of you fellows across the pond, or any country that doesn't use the rather peculiar British interpretation,

00:55.440 --> 00:56.640
is the 4th grade.

00:56.640 --> 01:01.480
Now Year 5 was a very interesting year for me, it was only the year that I had the most behavioural challenges.

01:01.480 --> 01:06.440
When I was young, I had a very hot-headed nature, I was prone to erupting unnecessarily,

01:06.440 --> 01:08.800
and it didn't make me a particularly popular person.

01:08.800 --> 01:12.080
A lot of that stress was rooted in the fact that I'd always felt excluded,

01:12.080 --> 01:15.800
and everyone had been antagonistic to me in a way, they gave me a reputation,

01:15.800 --> 01:19.120
and I, being the foolish individual, chose to conform to it.

01:19.120 --> 01:24.640
A real problem for me at that age was the fact that I had very little opportunity to release a lot of my own personal battles

01:24.640 --> 01:26.840
that were occurring inside my ever-active mind.

01:26.840 --> 01:32.080
However, one day I had an English class, an English class that I made the active decision to pay attention in for once,

01:32.080 --> 01:36.000
and in this lesson, the tutor introduced us to five conceptual devices of poetry.

01:36.000 --> 01:39.760
Now, this was new to me, and I hope this is probably not new to you now,

01:39.760 --> 01:41.800
but if I recall correctly, I do remember them.

01:41.800 --> 01:45.520
They were alliteration, onomatopoeia, simile, metaphor, and imagery.

01:45.520 --> 01:49.520
These were new concepts to me, but as I said, they still stick in my head to this day,

01:49.520 --> 01:54.000
because they were what started the foundations of my scripts, my lyrics, and my poetry.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.560
And we're gonna be focusing on the poetry at first here,

01:56.560 --> 02:00.640
because poetry was the first time I was ever able to exercise those newfound devices,

02:00.640 --> 02:05.600
and I still remember it to this day, which is unique in a way, because I'm not a proactive student,

02:05.600 --> 02:09.440
I'm not someone who works to please any more than beyond exam results,

02:09.440 --> 02:13.320
and this poem was no exam, to me it could have been another throwaway task,

02:13.320 --> 02:15.840
and yet when I wrote it, people were really impressed.

02:15.840 --> 02:22.000
The teacher gave me great praise, and my parents supposedly ran it online to check I hadn't plagiarised it,

02:22.000 --> 02:25.240
yet to me it was another standard task, and I guess at that moment,

02:25.240 --> 02:30.840
I realised I did have a rhetorical talent that I could wield, unlike many other devices.

02:30.840 --> 02:36.360
It was the first time that I managed to stem a lot of my creativity and thoughts into this new technique,

02:36.360 --> 02:40.120
and it pushed a lot of my pent up pain and internal troubles out.

02:40.120 --> 02:45.880
And in a way, it did get better, life felt nicer when I was venting and putting down my emotions on a page,

02:45.880 --> 02:50.200
there is something liberating about it, and turning it into something that reflects you as a person,

02:50.200 --> 02:53.320
even if not everyone approves of that person that you project,

02:53.320 --> 02:58.400
and I think I still call on these memories because they're the foundations that are still steady to this day.

02:58.400 --> 03:04.640
When you let that creativity become part of you, it's a lot harder to let it go, it's not just general knowledge anymore.

03:04.640 --> 03:08.520
I did speech and drama, and you can probably tell that with my dramatic inflections,

03:08.520 --> 03:11.880
but I never read poetry, most of all I never learned poetry,

03:11.880 --> 03:15.360
that's the thing, I think that true poetry isn't something that can be learned,

03:15.360 --> 03:18.560
you learn the principles and the basics, but the rest is up to you,

03:18.560 --> 03:22.840
to turn it into something creative, and that creativity that such a task can drive,

03:22.840 --> 03:26.760
that is something that spills over into every written persuasion you choose to embark in.

03:26.760 --> 03:31.440
My favourite poem at that age was a Roald Dahl spin on the Little Red Riding Hood tale,

03:31.440 --> 03:35.080
when I was partaking in many activities, I was still a boy,

03:35.080 --> 03:37.520
but when I picked up that pen, I became a man.

03:37.520 --> 03:41.760
Those principles, simile, metaphor, alliteration, imagery, and onomatopoeia,

03:41.760 --> 03:45.640
particularly the first three, they do not need introduction or explanation,

03:45.640 --> 03:48.280
if you are not privy with their definitions, you can look them up,

03:48.280 --> 03:51.480
but I'll probably have them up on screen anyway, because I'm a pushover.

03:51.480 --> 03:54.200
The poem I wrote back then was about a shed,

03:54.200 --> 03:57.760
I can still remember the outdated Microsoft Word background I slapped on it,

03:57.760 --> 04:01.760
when I used a background image from Google search of a shed with grass in front of it,

04:01.760 --> 04:06.000
with the characters outlining everything I put in that shed, and how it represented me,

04:06.000 --> 04:10.880
and in a way that exercise itself was unique, because it helped me build a bond with the poem,

04:10.880 --> 04:14.920
with what I was writing, and how I wanted to express myself as a person,

04:14.920 --> 04:17.720
by integrating my own personality within it.

04:17.720 --> 04:21.800
And I guess that's the first time I felt a spark for writing, like I never had before,

04:21.800 --> 04:25.880
it was not the first time I'd written something, it was not the first time I'd written even a poem,

04:25.880 --> 04:28.320
it was the first time that I cared about a product though,

04:28.320 --> 04:32.600
it was the first thing that I ever got credit for, that didn't take excessive amounts of time,

04:32.600 --> 04:36.120
it was something that came naturally to me, and it felt right.

04:36.120 --> 04:40.280
From there, I have taken it in many directions, I've written movie scripts, I've written songs,

04:40.280 --> 04:44.800
and now I'm here, writing YouTube videos, and it all came from writing a poem essentially,

04:44.800 --> 04:48.640
and that's because poems are the best way to pick up these techniques in many ways,

04:48.640 --> 04:53.040
because you're trying to articulate something in a structurally and expressively elevated way,

04:53.040 --> 04:57.360
and you're introduced to these concepts that mould your subconscious with another simulation,

04:57.360 --> 05:01.880
it's a way that has been therapeutic and beneficial to my technique and style,

05:01.880 --> 05:06.080
and so when I felt it right to return to my writing roots after years of hiatus,

05:06.080 --> 05:10.080
wanting to do a simple script for a YouTube video, it never deserted me,

05:10.080 --> 05:12.280
and it is the reason why I'm here today.

05:12.280 --> 05:16.560
There are many times when I've sought to offset pain, the feeling of helplessness in this world,

05:16.560 --> 05:20.000
which is why this channel exists in a way, but through it all, I'm glad it does,

05:20.000 --> 05:24.320
because it has helped me through those times like many other things just couldn't,

05:24.320 --> 05:28.520
and out of all the things I'm thankful for, I'm thankful for picking up a pen in year 5

05:28.520 --> 05:32.440
and writing a poem that bonded to me as a writer and as a human being.

05:32.440 --> 05:37.160
There is so much that a simple line, a simple phrase can cause, so if you're stuck for inspiration,

05:37.160 --> 05:41.520
if you're looking for that spark to turn into a creative wildfire, do some digging,

05:41.520 --> 05:46.320
learn some devices and apply them, whether it's a poem, song or script, give it your best shot.

05:46.320 --> 05:49.520
In my opinion, poetry is a great way to enter the writing game,

05:49.520 --> 05:54.040
because you can project yourself on a page and you can use a lot of these devices.

05:54.040 --> 05:59.200
It's a brilliant way to discover oneself and to express it in new and unique approaches.

05:59.200 --> 06:04.920
I know this is going to be a bit of a transition, but the reason this video exists was for a Patreon,

06:04.920 --> 06:09.320
Licorice Pepsi, who made the very generous donation of $20 at the turn of January.

06:09.320 --> 06:14.200
I'm very grateful for her kindness, as she has been exceptionally amenable and fantastic to talk to as well,

06:14.200 --> 06:17.280
a great person all round. If you want to get involved with my Patreon,

06:17.280 --> 06:20.080
then I'll put a link at the end of the video and in the description.

06:20.080 --> 06:23.520
I know this is a slightly different video, but I hope you enjoyed it nonetheless,

06:23.520 --> 06:27.840
one that was certainly more sentimental and a calm turn from the normal right opinion.

06:27.840 --> 06:33.520
Did you enjoy it? I'd love to hear. Until then, I'm The Right Opinion, and I'll see you in the next one.

06:33.520 --> 06:46.640
Thanks for watching!
