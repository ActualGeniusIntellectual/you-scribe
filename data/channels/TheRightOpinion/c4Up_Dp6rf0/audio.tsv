0	2480	Let's talk about a more personal subject.
8080	12080	Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time.
12080	17200	And today we're going to be talking about poetry, and how it influenced my creativity and me as a person.
17200	22840	Now many of you will be thinking right now, hang on Mr Right Opinion, this isn't a spicy take on the latest hot topic,
22840	25240	this is story time with the right mongo.
25240	28440	Well I'm here today by request, and a request that I'm very grateful of,
28440	32720	and I'll expand on that at the end of the video, just not right now so I don't make it too clunky.
32720	35800	But first, let's hop in the time machine and go back to a past,
35800	38960	a past where The Right Opinion wasn't a miserable, cynical student,
38960	41560	and actually had a mildly positive outlook on the world.
41560	46800	I mean, I always really hated it, but still a time where I was more readily excited at prospects.
46800	50280	It was school, I was in what the British regard as Year 5,
50280	55440	which for any of you fellows across the pond, or any country that doesn't use the rather peculiar British interpretation,
55440	56640	is the 4th grade.
56640	61480	Now Year 5 was a very interesting year for me, it was only the year that I had the most behavioural challenges.
61480	66440	When I was young, I had a very hot-headed nature, I was prone to erupting unnecessarily,
66440	68800	and it didn't make me a particularly popular person.
68800	72080	A lot of that stress was rooted in the fact that I'd always felt excluded,
72080	75800	and everyone had been antagonistic to me in a way, they gave me a reputation,
75800	79120	and I, being the foolish individual, chose to conform to it.
79120	84640	A real problem for me at that age was the fact that I had very little opportunity to release a lot of my own personal battles
84640	86840	that were occurring inside my ever-active mind.
86840	92080	However, one day I had an English class, an English class that I made the active decision to pay attention in for once,
92080	96000	and in this lesson, the tutor introduced us to five conceptual devices of poetry.
96000	99760	Now, this was new to me, and I hope this is probably not new to you now,
99760	101800	but if I recall correctly, I do remember them.
101800	105520	They were alliteration, onomatopoeia, simile, metaphor, and imagery.
105520	109520	These were new concepts to me, but as I said, they still stick in my head to this day,
109520	114000	because they were what started the foundations of my scripts, my lyrics, and my poetry.
114000	116560	And we're gonna be focusing on the poetry at first here,
116560	120640	because poetry was the first time I was ever able to exercise those newfound devices,
120640	125600	and I still remember it to this day, which is unique in a way, because I'm not a proactive student,
125600	129440	I'm not someone who works to please any more than beyond exam results,
129440	133320	and this poem was no exam, to me it could have been another throwaway task,
133320	135840	and yet when I wrote it, people were really impressed.
135840	142000	The teacher gave me great praise, and my parents supposedly ran it online to check I hadn't plagiarised it,
142000	145240	yet to me it was another standard task, and I guess at that moment,
145240	150840	I realised I did have a rhetorical talent that I could wield, unlike many other devices.
150840	156360	It was the first time that I managed to stem a lot of my creativity and thoughts into this new technique,
156360	160120	and it pushed a lot of my pent up pain and internal troubles out.
160120	165880	And in a way, it did get better, life felt nicer when I was venting and putting down my emotions on a page,
165880	170200	there is something liberating about it, and turning it into something that reflects you as a person,
170200	173320	even if not everyone approves of that person that you project,
173320	178400	and I think I still call on these memories because they're the foundations that are still steady to this day.
178400	184640	When you let that creativity become part of you, it's a lot harder to let it go, it's not just general knowledge anymore.
184640	188520	I did speech and drama, and you can probably tell that with my dramatic inflections,
188520	191880	but I never read poetry, most of all I never learned poetry,
191880	195360	that's the thing, I think that true poetry isn't something that can be learned,
195360	198560	you learn the principles and the basics, but the rest is up to you,
198560	202840	to turn it into something creative, and that creativity that such a task can drive,
202840	206760	that is something that spills over into every written persuasion you choose to embark in.
206760	211440	My favourite poem at that age was a Roald Dahl spin on the Little Red Riding Hood tale,
211440	215080	when I was partaking in many activities, I was still a boy,
215080	217520	but when I picked up that pen, I became a man.
217520	221760	Those principles, simile, metaphor, alliteration, imagery, and onomatopoeia,
221760	225640	particularly the first three, they do not need introduction or explanation,
225640	228280	if you are not privy with their definitions, you can look them up,
228280	231480	but I'll probably have them up on screen anyway, because I'm a pushover.
231480	234200	The poem I wrote back then was about a shed,
234200	237760	I can still remember the outdated Microsoft Word background I slapped on it,
237760	241760	when I used a background image from Google search of a shed with grass in front of it,
241760	246000	with the characters outlining everything I put in that shed, and how it represented me,
246000	250880	and in a way that exercise itself was unique, because it helped me build a bond with the poem,
250880	254920	with what I was writing, and how I wanted to express myself as a person,
254920	257720	by integrating my own personality within it.
257720	261800	And I guess that's the first time I felt a spark for writing, like I never had before,
261800	265880	it was not the first time I'd written something, it was not the first time I'd written even a poem,
265880	268320	it was the first time that I cared about a product though,
268320	272600	it was the first thing that I ever got credit for, that didn't take excessive amounts of time,
272600	276120	it was something that came naturally to me, and it felt right.
276120	280280	From there, I have taken it in many directions, I've written movie scripts, I've written songs,
280280	284800	and now I'm here, writing YouTube videos, and it all came from writing a poem essentially,
284800	288640	and that's because poems are the best way to pick up these techniques in many ways,
288640	293040	because you're trying to articulate something in a structurally and expressively elevated way,
293040	297360	and you're introduced to these concepts that mould your subconscious with another simulation,
297360	301880	it's a way that has been therapeutic and beneficial to my technique and style,
301880	306080	and so when I felt it right to return to my writing roots after years of hiatus,
306080	310080	wanting to do a simple script for a YouTube video, it never deserted me,
310080	312280	and it is the reason why I'm here today.
312280	316560	There are many times when I've sought to offset pain, the feeling of helplessness in this world,
316560	320000	which is why this channel exists in a way, but through it all, I'm glad it does,
320000	324320	because it has helped me through those times like many other things just couldn't,
324320	328520	and out of all the things I'm thankful for, I'm thankful for picking up a pen in year 5
328520	332440	and writing a poem that bonded to me as a writer and as a human being.
332440	337160	There is so much that a simple line, a simple phrase can cause, so if you're stuck for inspiration,
337160	341520	if you're looking for that spark to turn into a creative wildfire, do some digging,
341520	346320	learn some devices and apply them, whether it's a poem, song or script, give it your best shot.
346320	349520	In my opinion, poetry is a great way to enter the writing game,
349520	354040	because you can project yourself on a page and you can use a lot of these devices.
354040	359200	It's a brilliant way to discover oneself and to express it in new and unique approaches.
359200	364920	I know this is going to be a bit of a transition, but the reason this video exists was for a Patreon,
364920	369320	Licorice Pepsi, who made the very generous donation of $20 at the turn of January.
369320	374200	I'm very grateful for her kindness, as she has been exceptionally amenable and fantastic to talk to as well,
374200	377280	a great person all round. If you want to get involved with my Patreon,
377280	380080	then I'll put a link at the end of the video and in the description.
380080	383520	I know this is a slightly different video, but I hope you enjoyed it nonetheless,
383520	387840	one that was certainly more sentimental and a calm turn from the normal right opinion.
387840	393520	Did you enjoy it? I'd love to hear. Until then, I'm The Right Opinion, and I'll see you in the next one.
393520	406640	Thanks for watching!
