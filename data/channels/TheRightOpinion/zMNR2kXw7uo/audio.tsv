0	2480	What a bunch of bellends.
2480	10480	Hello ladies and gentlemen and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with
10480	13240	too much free time and today we talk about the internet.
13240	17320	The internet is a great realm of many varying degrees of interest and insanity.
17320	20640	We are blessed by the fact that websites are at the control of their owners and that we
20640	23480	the user have access to them of equal variance.
23480	27640	It is an important owner user relationship that helps cater to the direct link which
27640	29880	is infallible at the point of service.
29880	33640	I'm a big guy on control, I believe greatly in personal autonomy, so although I have my
33640	38580	criticisms of the internet, I consider the general freedom it fit a great asset, sometimes
38580	40760	too free but most of the time positive.
40760	44400	You'll notice that I put emphasis on the autonomy for many domain owners and for me that's a
44400	45400	great thing.
45400	48600	It allows people to have control over their content and another positive trait is that
48600	50440	everyone has an even playing field.
50440	54360	If you're starting up a website you'll be on the same level as any of the largest corporations
54360	58600	which means that your success will be based a lot more on merit rather than your privilege
58600	59700	so to say.
59700	63520	Yeah, rich companies will always have the advantage but I've said this many times before,
63520	66940	although I'm not myself for direct equality, I am for equal opportunity.
66940	70960	In my ideal world, a small start-up company would have the capacity to become a larger
70960	75860	company so I'm generally in favour of anything that facilitates it and against things that
75860	76860	hinder it.
76860	78580	So let's talk about net neutrality.
78580	82540	It's an anti-discriminatory regulation which means that internet providers can't necessarily
82540	86700	censor what people use and give preference to certain websites over speed and access.
86700	90220	Now the salty cable companies, who are basically vampires and will extract money wherever
90220	94080	they can sniff it, want to change it as the current scenario doesn't enable them to exploit
94080	97380	people and websites as much as they normally feel like they should be able to.
97380	101980	I mean to put it lightly, they're not acting out of selfless benefit for society, they
101980	103900	want to get rid of net neutrality.
103900	107620	Now the problem is this will make it far too easy for companies to tier faster internet
107620	112140	for domains who can pay for it and also create paywalls for certain websites for users.
112140	115540	Which is great for the larger corporations but as someone in favour of the aforementioned
115540	117900	values it makes me sternly against it.
117900	121500	Now I know what some people would say, this is just them freeing up the market for less
121500	123240	red tape and more competition.
123240	127600	The problem is in the US there is no competition between cable companies, in fact they've all
127600	129380	agreed not to compete.
129380	133020	Competition is a necessary essence for markets like that to work and if they're not going
133020	136900	to behave and just jointly try to exploit people with their new found powers, they're
136900	140980	as good as a monopoly and they have to have some restrictions and for me that's the ultimate
140980	141980	deal breaker.
141980	145340	The reason why there is so much organised exploitation is to the point where I wouldn't
145340	148380	even trust them with a tenner, let alone even more internet power.
148380	152100	But let's get an example here, let's say you have car insurance and this car insurance
152100	153100	is too expensive.
153100	155940	The positive aspect is that you can change to cheaper car insurance.
155940	158860	That car insurance may have different perks or different coverage but at the end of the
158860	162920	day you have a choice, for many people with cable companies that choice isn't enabled
162920	167340	currently and as someone who hates rules, they are necessary to stop a few greedy individuals
167340	168700	from getting out of hand.
168700	171900	Maybe it would be more warranted if as a citizen there were different companies offering
171900	175780	different packages, maybe if you only wanted to watch YouTube for example, then you would
175780	179080	be able to get a package simply offering preference to that website.
179080	183640	But the issue is that is not how it has worked and we cannot trust them to let it work like
183640	185140	that in the future.
185140	187340	Once again, history has attested to that.
187340	190300	As shown, there have been multiple problems in the past with these companies not being
190300	192840	trustworthy enough to allow the consumer to choose.
192840	196180	And that's a sad thing, I actually don't have a problem with the idea on principle
196180	200420	but unfortunately principles are one thing that corporations don't have and if I can't
200420	203980	trust them to do good with whatever powers deregulation would grant them, then I can't
203980	204980	grant them it.
204980	208820	All these suggestions of cordoning off faster broadband websites who pay more is a perfect
208820	212260	example of how this could be very easily misused.
212260	216620	They are just greedy bastards and that's a shame because I like to find positives in
216620	221380	the case for deregulation but most importantly I don't see a case where removing net neutrality
221380	222380	would be good.
222380	226120	For users and aspiring entrepreneurs alike, there is a large enough gap between the richest
226120	227960	and poorest in society already.
227960	232280	This is just the richest wanting more and yes, I understand, we all want to make money
232280	236000	but I try not to make it off pushing others down and the current laws are important to
236000	237000	maintain that.
237000	240320	If you haven't already, I'll leave a link below if you feel inclined to make your voice
240320	241320	hurt.
241320	243680	Otherwise, I'm The Right Opinion and I'll see you in the next one.
