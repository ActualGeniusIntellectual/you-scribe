00:00.000 --> 00:02.480
What a bunch of bellends.

00:02.480 --> 00:10.480
Hello ladies and gentlemen and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with

00:10.480 --> 00:13.240
too much free time and today we talk about the internet.

00:13.240 --> 00:17.320
The internet is a great realm of many varying degrees of interest and insanity.

00:17.320 --> 00:20.640
We are blessed by the fact that websites are at the control of their owners and that we

00:20.640 --> 00:23.480
the user have access to them of equal variance.

00:23.480 --> 00:27.640
It is an important owner user relationship that helps cater to the direct link which

00:27.640 --> 00:29.880
is infallible at the point of service.

00:29.880 --> 00:33.640
I'm a big guy on control, I believe greatly in personal autonomy, so although I have my

00:33.640 --> 00:38.580
criticisms of the internet, I consider the general freedom it fit a great asset, sometimes

00:38.580 --> 00:40.760
too free but most of the time positive.

00:40.760 --> 00:44.400
You'll notice that I put emphasis on the autonomy for many domain owners and for me that's a

00:44.400 --> 00:45.400
great thing.

00:45.400 --> 00:48.600
It allows people to have control over their content and another positive trait is that

00:48.600 --> 00:50.440
everyone has an even playing field.

00:50.440 --> 00:54.360
If you're starting up a website you'll be on the same level as any of the largest corporations

00:54.360 --> 00:58.600
which means that your success will be based a lot more on merit rather than your privilege

00:58.600 --> 00:59.700
so to say.

00:59.700 --> 01:03.520
Yeah, rich companies will always have the advantage but I've said this many times before,

01:03.520 --> 01:06.940
although I'm not myself for direct equality, I am for equal opportunity.

01:06.940 --> 01:10.960
In my ideal world, a small start-up company would have the capacity to become a larger

01:10.960 --> 01:15.860
company so I'm generally in favour of anything that facilitates it and against things that

01:15.860 --> 01:16.860
hinder it.

01:16.860 --> 01:18.580
So let's talk about net neutrality.

01:18.580 --> 01:22.540
It's an anti-discriminatory regulation which means that internet providers can't necessarily

01:22.540 --> 01:26.700
censor what people use and give preference to certain websites over speed and access.

01:26.700 --> 01:30.220
Now the salty cable companies, who are basically vampires and will extract money wherever

01:30.220 --> 01:34.080
they can sniff it, want to change it as the current scenario doesn't enable them to exploit

01:34.080 --> 01:37.380
people and websites as much as they normally feel like they should be able to.

01:37.380 --> 01:41.980
I mean to put it lightly, they're not acting out of selfless benefit for society, they

01:41.980 --> 01:43.900
want to get rid of net neutrality.

01:43.900 --> 01:47.620
Now the problem is this will make it far too easy for companies to tier faster internet

01:47.620 --> 01:52.140
for domains who can pay for it and also create paywalls for certain websites for users.

01:52.140 --> 01:55.540
Which is great for the larger corporations but as someone in favour of the aforementioned

01:55.540 --> 01:57.900
values it makes me sternly against it.

01:57.900 --> 02:01.500
Now I know what some people would say, this is just them freeing up the market for less

02:01.500 --> 02:03.240
red tape and more competition.

02:03.240 --> 02:07.600
The problem is in the US there is no competition between cable companies, in fact they've all

02:07.600 --> 02:09.380
agreed not to compete.

02:09.380 --> 02:13.020
Competition is a necessary essence for markets like that to work and if they're not going

02:13.020 --> 02:16.900
to behave and just jointly try to exploit people with their new found powers, they're

02:16.900 --> 02:20.980
as good as a monopoly and they have to have some restrictions and for me that's the ultimate

02:20.980 --> 02:21.980
deal breaker.

02:21.980 --> 02:25.340
The reason why there is so much organised exploitation is to the point where I wouldn't

02:25.340 --> 02:28.380
even trust them with a tenner, let alone even more internet power.

02:28.380 --> 02:32.100
But let's get an example here, let's say you have car insurance and this car insurance

02:32.100 --> 02:33.100
is too expensive.

02:33.100 --> 02:35.940
The positive aspect is that you can change to cheaper car insurance.

02:35.940 --> 02:38.860
That car insurance may have different perks or different coverage but at the end of the

02:38.860 --> 02:42.920
day you have a choice, for many people with cable companies that choice isn't enabled

02:42.920 --> 02:47.340
currently and as someone who hates rules, they are necessary to stop a few greedy individuals

02:47.340 --> 02:48.700
from getting out of hand.

02:48.700 --> 02:51.900
Maybe it would be more warranted if as a citizen there were different companies offering

02:51.900 --> 02:55.780
different packages, maybe if you only wanted to watch YouTube for example, then you would

02:55.780 --> 02:59.080
be able to get a package simply offering preference to that website.

02:59.080 --> 03:03.640
But the issue is that is not how it has worked and we cannot trust them to let it work like

03:03.640 --> 03:05.140
that in the future.

03:05.140 --> 03:07.340
Once again, history has attested to that.

03:07.340 --> 03:10.300
As shown, there have been multiple problems in the past with these companies not being

03:10.300 --> 03:12.840
trustworthy enough to allow the consumer to choose.

03:12.840 --> 03:16.180
And that's a sad thing, I actually don't have a problem with the idea on principle

03:16.180 --> 03:20.420
but unfortunately principles are one thing that corporations don't have and if I can't

03:20.420 --> 03:23.980
trust them to do good with whatever powers deregulation would grant them, then I can't

03:23.980 --> 03:24.980
grant them it.

03:24.980 --> 03:28.820
All these suggestions of cordoning off faster broadband websites who pay more is a perfect

03:28.820 --> 03:32.260
example of how this could be very easily misused.

03:32.260 --> 03:36.620
They are just greedy bastards and that's a shame because I like to find positives in

03:36.620 --> 03:41.380
the case for deregulation but most importantly I don't see a case where removing net neutrality

03:41.380 --> 03:42.380
would be good.

03:42.380 --> 03:46.120
For users and aspiring entrepreneurs alike, there is a large enough gap between the richest

03:46.120 --> 03:47.960
and poorest in society already.

03:47.960 --> 03:52.280
This is just the richest wanting more and yes, I understand, we all want to make money

03:52.280 --> 03:56.000
but I try not to make it off pushing others down and the current laws are important to

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
maintain that.

03:57.000 --> 04:00.320
If you haven't already, I'll leave a link below if you feel inclined to make your voice

04:00.320 --> 04:01.320
hurt.

04:01.320 --> 04:03.680
Otherwise, I'm The Right Opinion and I'll see you in the next one.
