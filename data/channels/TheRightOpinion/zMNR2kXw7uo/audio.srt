00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,480
What a bunch of bellends.

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:10,480
Hello ladies and gentlemen and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:13,240
too much free time and today we talk about the internet.

4
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:17,320
The internet is a great realm of many varying degrees of interest and insanity.

5
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:20,640
We are blessed by the fact that websites are at the control of their owners and that we

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,480
the user have access to them of equal variance.

7
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:27,640
It is an important owner user relationship that helps cater to the direct link which

8
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,880
is infallible at the point of service.

9
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,640
I'm a big guy on control, I believe greatly in personal autonomy, so although I have my

10
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:38,580
criticisms of the internet, I consider the general freedom it fit a great asset, sometimes

11
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,760
too free but most of the time positive.

12
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:44,400
You'll notice that I put emphasis on the autonomy for many domain owners and for me that's a

13
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,400
great thing.

14
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:48,600
It allows people to have control over their content and another positive trait is that

15
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,440
everyone has an even playing field.

16
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:54,360
If you're starting up a website you'll be on the same level as any of the largest corporations

17
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:58,600
which means that your success will be based a lot more on merit rather than your privilege

18
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,700
so to say.

19
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:03,520
Yeah, rich companies will always have the advantage but I've said this many times before,

20
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,940
although I'm not myself for direct equality, I am for equal opportunity.

21
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:10,960
In my ideal world, a small start-up company would have the capacity to become a larger

22
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,860
company so I'm generally in favour of anything that facilitates it and against things that

23
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:16,860
hinder it.

24
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,580
So let's talk about net neutrality.

25
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:22,540
It's an anti-discriminatory regulation which means that internet providers can't necessarily

26
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:26,700
censor what people use and give preference to certain websites over speed and access.

27
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,220
Now the salty cable companies, who are basically vampires and will extract money wherever

28
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:34,080
they can sniff it, want to change it as the current scenario doesn't enable them to exploit

29
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,380
people and websites as much as they normally feel like they should be able to.

30
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:41,980
I mean to put it lightly, they're not acting out of selfless benefit for society, they

31
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:43,900
want to get rid of net neutrality.

32
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:47,620
Now the problem is this will make it far too easy for companies to tier faster internet

33
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:52,140
for domains who can pay for it and also create paywalls for certain websites for users.

34
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:55,540
Which is great for the larger corporations but as someone in favour of the aforementioned

35
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:57,900
values it makes me sternly against it.

36
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:01,500
Now I know what some people would say, this is just them freeing up the market for less

37
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,240
red tape and more competition.

38
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,600
The problem is in the US there is no competition between cable companies, in fact they've all

39
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,380
agreed not to compete.

40
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:13,020
Competition is a necessary essence for markets like that to work and if they're not going

41
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:16,900
to behave and just jointly try to exploit people with their new found powers, they're

42
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:20,980
as good as a monopoly and they have to have some restrictions and for me that's the ultimate

43
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:21,980
deal breaker.

44
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:25,340
The reason why there is so much organised exploitation is to the point where I wouldn't

45
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:28,380
even trust them with a tenner, let alone even more internet power.

46
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:32,100
But let's get an example here, let's say you have car insurance and this car insurance

47
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,100
is too expensive.

48
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:35,940
The positive aspect is that you can change to cheaper car insurance.

49
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:38,860
That car insurance may have different perks or different coverage but at the end of the

50
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:42,920
day you have a choice, for many people with cable companies that choice isn't enabled

51
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:47,340
currently and as someone who hates rules, they are necessary to stop a few greedy individuals

52
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,700
from getting out of hand.

53
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:51,900
Maybe it would be more warranted if as a citizen there were different companies offering

54
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:55,780
different packages, maybe if you only wanted to watch YouTube for example, then you would

55
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:59,080
be able to get a package simply offering preference to that website.

56
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:03,640
But the issue is that is not how it has worked and we cannot trust them to let it work like

57
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,140
that in the future.

58
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:07,340
Once again, history has attested to that.

59
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:10,300
As shown, there have been multiple problems in the past with these companies not being

60
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,840
trustworthy enough to allow the consumer to choose.

61
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:16,180
And that's a sad thing, I actually don't have a problem with the idea on principle

62
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:20,420
but unfortunately principles are one thing that corporations don't have and if I can't

63
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:23,980
trust them to do good with whatever powers deregulation would grant them, then I can't

64
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:24,980
grant them it.

65
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:28,820
All these suggestions of cordoning off faster broadband websites who pay more is a perfect

66
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:32,260
example of how this could be very easily misused.

67
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:36,620
They are just greedy bastards and that's a shame because I like to find positives in

68
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:41,380
the case for deregulation but most importantly I don't see a case where removing net neutrality

69
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:42,380
would be good.

70
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:46,120
For users and aspiring entrepreneurs alike, there is a large enough gap between the richest

71
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,960
and poorest in society already.

72
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:52,280
This is just the richest wanting more and yes, I understand, we all want to make money

73
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:56,000
but I try not to make it off pushing others down and the current laws are important to

74
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
maintain that.

75
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,320
If you haven't already, I'll leave a link below if you feel inclined to make your voice

76
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,320
hurt.

77
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,680
Otherwise, I'm The Right Opinion and I'll see you in the next one.
