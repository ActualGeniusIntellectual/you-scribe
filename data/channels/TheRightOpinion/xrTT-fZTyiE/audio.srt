00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Hello ladies and gentlemen and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,900
too much free time, and here's a video that I never thought I'd do.

3
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:13,900
Why you may ask?

4
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:19,160
Well, to understand that we have to go back a couple of years, to 2016, when a YouTuber,

5
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:22,960
Colossalers, Crazy, you know, the one you twats won't stop comparing me to, released

6
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,840
his long overdue video on Fouseytube, named An Alternate Reality.

7
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,200
I was just initiating my interest into commentary, I'd had a YouTube channel for about 6 months,

8
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:35,160
but I'd been stuck in a bit of a rut and the videos I made were very niche.

9
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:39,380
People had messaged me from time to time saying, oh my god, you sound like Colossalers Crazy,

10
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:42,360
and although I didn't particularly hear the resemblance myself, I guess anyone with

11
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:47,160
a remotely posh accent sounds like clown to you bastards who don't live in the UK.

12
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,620
Alright you American knobs, I get that your freeways have gaps in between the size of

13
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:52,920
Buckingham Palace, but we're not all that local.

14
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,880
Anyhow, before I get carried away on that very unique tangent, the point is, I literally

15
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:00,560
knew no one, and I got ushered into his Discord server and then presented to his content,

16
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,920
and I'm not gonna lie, it was quite the encounter.

17
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:07,120
I'd never heard of Fousey, so this video was my introduction, and it was a pretty comprehensive

18
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,480
deconstruction of what Fousey stood for.

19
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:13,320
What I admired about it was that it managed to make a greater narrative on Fouseytube

20
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:17,440
as a person from mere surface value content, which is what I've always wanted to do with

21
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,440
my channel.

22
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:21,520
One of the responses that I loathe the most when criticising people is the line, you don't

23
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,840
know them, how can you talk about their intentions?

24
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:29,000
I do not know his intentions, but I have my opinions, based on what I have observed.

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,720
Fousey is a perfect example of how someone cannot explicitly commit any wrongdoings,

26
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:37,280
but have the most corrupted ideas of what he wants to gain from his content, and the

27
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,620
people watching it.

28
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:42,520
This is generally what I took away from Colossal's video, although these sample videos were limited,

29
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:47,040
he did a great job creating an elaborate character portrait, and really I didn't feel the necessity

30
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,180
to cover it any more than I did back in the day.

31
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:53,500
I did a video criticising his motivation to push a political agenda through his content,

32
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:57,580
as that was a bit more in my direction, and then his decision to copyright strike Colossal

33
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:59,700
for content that was clearly fair use.

34
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:03,180
My interaction with his content has been minimal otherwise.

35
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:06,880
And honestly, after he'd gone on a pretty prolonged hiatus, I thought I'd never deal

36
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,780
with him again, I mean, what more is there to know about him?

37
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:14,580
Admittedly, I wasn't that interested, I assumed he was just a shitty person in a powerful

38
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:18,100
position, but oh my, looks like we've got some revisiting to do.

39
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:21,500
Because recently, people have been claiming he's flying off the rails, into something

40
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:26,560
rather warring, something that not even the extensive lengths of Colossal's video covered.

41
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,020
A strange insanity that I felt the need to investigate, and perhaps explain.

42
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:36,020
You see, he planned and hosted something that was branded as Fusicon, it was marketed as

43
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:41,140
this big event with multiple artists, it basically was just Fusi having a massive trade with

44
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:45,760
a few musicians, and lit Pappy, the greatest artist of all time.

45
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:50,080
And speaking of music, Fusi has started releasing his own, which once again, he's more than

46
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,080
at liberty to.

47
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:54,560
However, regarding the convention, he made lots of wild claims, one of which was the

48
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,520
assertion that Drake was going to be performing, which apparently wasn't quite the case.

49
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:03,480
Well, wasn't the case at all, there is a ton of footage of him behaving extremely erratically

50
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:07,220
and impulsively, and it's very easy for commentators to look at him right now and

51
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:12,280
try and explain what's going on in the moment, because it is bizarre, very bizarre.

52
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:16,600
There are claims about his mental health, the idea that he's not on medication, bipolar,

53
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:20,660
depression, mania, and it's very possible, but there are other people with more of an

54
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:24,480
insight into that currently, so I'd ask you to go and check out those videos, because

55
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,680
I am many things, but I'm not quite rolling with the big boys of YouTube yet, though I'm

56
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:32,640
sure it's only a matter of time lads, until me and Daddy Keem are united.

57
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:37,400
Anyhow, before I lose myself in sweet daydreams of a better time, I need to discuss the man

58
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,720
in question, Fusitube.

59
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:42,280
Now, Colossal's still working on part two of his video, so I want to avoid stepping

60
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:46,280
on his toes, but I don't want it to be a surface level analysis either, so I'm gonna

61
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:50,240
try and give you a little cocktail with a little twist, a little fireball in there.

62
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:54,040
I'd also like to say that although it is important to be sensitive of whatever mental

63
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:58,320
conditions a person may suffer from, it doesn't necessarily alleviate criticism that can be

64
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:03,600
levied a person's way, especially as a public figure, which is why although I may be empathetic

65
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:07,880
to any disorders he's suffering from, I will be doing my best to keep his actions

66
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,240
separate from anything that may influence it.

67
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:15,840
As his career shows, he clearly has the capability to take some level of responsibility for himself.

68
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,680
Unfortunately, Fusi has placed himself in an occupation that is continuously in the

69
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,320
public eye, and as a functioning human being, he can't expect special treatment, especially

70
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:29,520
as he expects to exercise the same influence over those around him as his contemporaries.

71
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:34,700
So today what I plan to do is to have a good delve into the background of Fusitube, and

72
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:44,260
what may have led him down the road that took him to this.

73
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:45,260
Delicious.

74
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:47,580
There has to be an explanation.

75
00:04:47,580 --> 00:05:08,100
So without further ado, let's get to it.

76
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:11,580
Everyone knows Fusi, but does anyone really know Yusuf Erekat?

77
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:15,220
I'm sure that's a question he throws around a lot towards his detractors.

78
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:17,140
Well let's have a look into his history.

79
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:21,520
Fusi is obviously notorious for his pranks, a little escapade that we'll definitely

80
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:26,020
investigate sooner or later, however he started his channel in a different direction, comedy.

81
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:30,000
This wasn't a fruitless venture either, in fact it was highly fortuitous for him.

82
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,140
His video on Middle Eastern parents was reported to have garnered over 2 million views by 2012,

83
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:36,020
and it makes sense in a way.

84
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:40,660
He tapped into a very popular element of comedy, stereotypes, and satirised them to a classic

85
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:45,000
early 2010s effect, where the intention was favoured over the execution.

86
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,440
I could bash into how he's kind of pouring out his ethnicity, but I don't think that's

87
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:53,320
a worthwhile discussion, as I think you can't really prove anything, well not yet at least,

88
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:57,280
apart from the fact that his degree in theatre arts clearly didn't cover font design.

89
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,480
Oh yes, that's sexy.

90
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:04,400
But you know what, it's passable, inoffensive comedy, and it clearly resonated with an audience,

91
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,640
especially on Tumblr.

92
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,640
What else would I expect?

93
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:11,720
It was 2011, comedy was tame, let's players were big, everything was just about being

94
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:15,960
loud, expressive, and eye-catching, rather than really being challenging to the viewer.

95
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,800
So it did that, and people watched it.

96
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:21,760
A lot of what happened around this time is now privated, however, he did have a very

97
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:25,360
interesting interview, which weirdly echoed some of the stuff he said last week.

98
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,160
In one of the Fousey videos at the time, the dance dare one was shown on Ellen.

99
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:32,960
In this interview with the Mercury News, he said how his short-term goal was to get on

100
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,960
her show.

101
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:38,720
Next week, I'll be sitting with Ellen telling her how I pulled this off.

102
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,720
Interesting.

103
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:44,400
Generally, he's documented in this early period as being this very charitable bloke,

104
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,180
doing all these nice things, saying all this pseudo-inspirational bollocks.

105
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:52,400
His Twitter archive has been pretty much wiped, apart from a selection of tweets, including

106
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,280
this fantastic quote.

107
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,960
They can't stop me, even if they stop me.

108
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,680
Winston Churchill has tears in his eyes, mate.

109
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,080
Or also, he's always had a hard-on for Drake.

110
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,920
But like Drake likes to say,

111
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,520
Better late than never, but never late is better.

112
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:10,440
There was something missing from his content, and that was intellect.

113
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:14,480
For me, as a casual observer, it's clear that he wanted to be noticed by the mainstream

114
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,480
world.

115
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:18,120
He wanted to be seen as someone who could be this voice of reason.

116
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:22,360
He had already been regarded as an icon for many Muslims, due to the religious overtones

117
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,360
in his content.

118
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,720
However, he wanted to go one step further.

119
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:29,720
So once the water was tested with these skip videos, he turned to more thoughtful content.

120
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:33,820
Fousey, being a theatre student, was clearly familiar with dramatic tone, and knew how

121
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:37,900
to pace his videos to appease an audience looking for content that was competent, but

122
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:38,900
fairly un-cinematic.

123
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:44,020
However, the simplicity does allow for the heavy-handed messages to come through even

124
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:47,940
more, and probably give it plenty of shareability to all your aunties on Facebook.

125
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:50,540
However, on closer analysis, they're not the best.

126
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:54,240
Obviously, in context, these videos are a few years old, and it's quite incredible

127
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,340
how stands of content creation have evolved over the space of these few years.

128
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:02,300
However, the production values aren't really what I'm concerned about.

129
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:08,100
Having social commentary, especially as an inspirational bloke, is easy, as long as it's

130
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:12,020
not under the microscope, and back then, with a sentimental piano, you could practically

131
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:13,020
do anything.

132
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:17,180
But ladies and gentlemen, the right opinion is not won over that easily.

133
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:18,360
I'm a hard man.

134
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:24,620
His first attempt was this poem, which has river flows in you in the background, but

135
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:29,460
the topic was too vague, and was not hot button enough to get the views, though you can definitely

136
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:31,300
see what direction he is heading in.

137
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:35,100
Honestly, the first time he really tried to hit home with a deeper message was with his

138
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:40,500
video Ramadam Nightmare, which I think is meant to be some sort of dystopian comic sketch,

139
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,740
which is rather tonally confused.

140
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:46,300
Part of it is the normal, huh, funny because relatable, but then at the end there's just

141
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:50,500
this montage of all these people suffering, and a message to the tune of stop looking

142
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:54,760
at what you don't have, and start being thankful for what you do have, which made the right

143
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,620
opinion deduced from the fucking placard at the end.

144
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:00,140
This is a message that is worth saving for later.

145
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:04,980
However, nothing can really top Why I Starve, a Ramadam tale, in which he gives a lecture

146
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:05,980
on Ramadam.

147
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:10,420
Like his other video, it was generally with the same morale, with a slightly more creative

148
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:11,420
delivery.

149
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:30,600
And we have to be clear here, although we may find it funny in how contrived it is,

150
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:35,280
a lot of people really connected with this content and the humbleness that he promulgated.

151
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:38,320
He seemed like a messiah to many people within his fanbase.

152
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,920
This was repeated on a regular basis, some strawman would act ignorant, and then Fousey

153
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:47,160
would swing in and give some inspiring speech which kinda already explains something that

154
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:51,460
people know, just in a more self-righteous fashion, but that's most motivational speakers

155
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,620
so who cares anyway.

156
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:57,000
He also had his third channel, known as Fouseyville, which sounds like a nightmarish district of

157
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,040
Disneyworld, but he uploaded content on there a bit too, and although I found a few unlisted

158
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:05,500
videos, the one that I really wanted to know what happened to was his video Keep Religion

159
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:15,880
Out Of It, which some very special man decided to respond to.

160
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:20,520
But one can only wonder what he preached, he also had a video posted which had a title

161
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:24,540
like he was behind the scenes on a Drake video, once again a recurring theme.

162
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:29,520
Fousey positioned himself as a man of virtue, a man of wisdom, and to the casual viewer,

163
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,020
it might well seem like that.

164
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:35,680
Fousey was clearly at this point going in a direction that gave his content a more religious

165
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:40,280
philosophical edge, he had constructed his content off his own identity, and outside

166
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:45,280
of our horrible judgmental commentary sphere, his delivery, albeit preachy, would come across

167
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:48,400
as serviceable because of its marred mannered intentions.

168
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:53,240
However Fousey encountered a significant problem with his content, simply that his fanbase

169
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:57,280
wasn't really the one that would fulfil his dream, it wasn't the fanbase that was

170
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:00,620
going to get him in touch with Drake, it wasn't the content that was going to have

171
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:05,180
him propelled into the public spotlight, after all the most devoted sector of his fanbase,

172
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:08,700
you know the ones who are going to turn up to meet you, were highly predominantly Muslim,

173
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:12,380
and although there's nothing wrong with that, it also means that being an American,

174
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:16,440
the population of your viewership is a bit more dispersed, they're just not enough

175
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,840
to get Fousey where he wanted to be.

176
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:23,460
Which was this position of sheer autonomy, this guru, this absolute celebrity, who would

177
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:30,140
take the news for a slice of toast, but he was still looking for his bread and butter.

178
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:33,800
So at this point, Fousey's videos are doing fine for views, but let's be honest, he's

179
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:37,700
not making the splash that he wanted to, he's going to some conventions, doing some talks,

180
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:41,160
but he's not devout enough to become a moral religious figure, and not culturally relevant

181
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,260
enough to become a bona fide celebrity.

182
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:46,320
So he turned to Prank, providing that none had been unlisted.

183
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,560
The first visible video is the Hold My Hand Prank, which was quite the segue from Blame

184
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,820
the Terrorist, another serious video.

185
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:58,100
These are the type of people and the type of reasons I hate YouTube social experiments

186
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,100
now.

187
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,100
It's disgusting.

188
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,720
However much alike to his sketch videos, he took a similar approach.

189
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:07,120
The first set of pranks were to test the water, they cover fairly harmless topics, to me they've

190
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,560
always been awkward and unfunny, but plenty of people like them.

191
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,840
Generally I believe the appeal to these pranks is the reaction of the subjects, in part.

192
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:18,720
I think the audience has taken interest in the human condition, and nothing is more authentic

193
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,640
than a covert observation in which people react to an absurd situation, it's both

194
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,980
real and dramatic.

195
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:27,920
Now obviously, with the knowledge that these are all fake, this appeal is undermined, but

196
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,740
back then there was an extremely large demographic who went in with the premise that this was

197
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:36,000
all real, it probably never crossed their minds that it was staged, after all, why would

198
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
it?

199
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,720
However, it all upped Knapp when he decided to integrate his social commentary with his

200
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,720
pranks.

201
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,240
Colossal covered this fairly comprehensively in his video, so once again, go and check

202
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,240
his out.

203
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:49,920
To summarise, whereas his sketches with social commentary were obviously theatrically performed,

204
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,280
Fusi used the title of Social Experiments to present these staged scenarios.

205
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:57,720
The problem is that he often exploited hot button topics for the quote good cause or

206
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,880
some moral lecture.

207
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,840
However, the audience ate this up, because a serious look at humans was great for not

208
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:07,380
just clickbait, but also fantastic for any shitty Facebook page to scream, oh my god,

209
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:08,920
look at how horrible people are.

210
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,840
It's a diabolical tactic, but it worked.

211
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:17,200
Fun fact, fake news is much more readily shared by humans than robots, because of how emotionally

212
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,600
provocative it is.

213
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:23,280
Fusi himself even had these antics documented in certain articles, most notably the highly

214
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,140
reputable Huffington Post.

215
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:29,160
It worked at the time because it catered to people's agendas, however it wasn't smiles

216
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,160
all round.

217
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,400
In Colossal's video he clearly documents how Fusi tries to defend his actions through

218
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:36,740
appealing to a higher morality, and how that appeal is misguided.

219
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:40,800
Some may say that it was an attempt to hold on to fans, but for me it was a self-justification

220
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,440
for his own actions.

221
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:46,720
Fusi had built something that he had finally wanted to, he had a huge subscriber base and

222
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:51,840
he wanted to do stuff with it, he wanted to pose as the moral icon, and with the monumental

223
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:56,920
momentum, he reinvigorated his sort of FusiVille content on Dose of Fusi, in which he'd typically

224
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:01,560
do rather unexceptional vlogs, followed by a deep speech with swelling music.

225
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:05,280
Unfortunately for commentators, the ends did not justify the means, and that's the thing

226
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:09,120
that Fusi did not necessarily count on, and once all these pranks or social experiments

227
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,440
were revealed as faked, their whole reputation was tainted.

228
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,040
Nowadays it's no secret that a lot of these pranksters were absolute moral vacuums.

229
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:21,240
I look at individuals like Roman Atwood and see him trying to sell himself as a salt of

230
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:25,620
the earth family man, and I laugh, but there are people who absolutely love it, people

231
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:28,820
who eat that shit up every single day.

232
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:34,260
People loved Fusi, people still love Fusi, he made his chunk a hub for motivational speeches,

233
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:38,840
which is what he clearly always wanted to be, a motivator, famed for his kind deeds,

234
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:44,040
good messages, and philanthropy, and his social experiments gave him the platform to finally

235
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,040
do that.

236
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:49,720
He had that inspirational Wake video for example, which has now garnered 15 million views, and

237
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:54,040
make no mistake, I'm sure it inspired some people, and now he had a new audience, what

238
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,920
about that old religious image that he built?

239
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:01,960
I hate all religion, the reason I hate all religion is because religion is the reason

240
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:07,040
for our wars, religion is the reason people are killing each other in different countries,

241
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:11,720
religion is the reason people can't even live in the same land, religion is the reason

242
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:16,280
that people, you know, why we have so much animosity in the world, why there's so much

243
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:19,080
drama going on on the news, it's disgusting.

244
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,480
Well to hell with that then.

245
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,240
And make no mistake, he may have changed his position, but such an incredible shift, it's

246
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,820
hard to put down to time, particularly as he recently put out this image, explained

247
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:31,480
that he hadn't prayed with pure intentions since he was 13.

248
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:35,000
Considering he was in his early 20s when he made his more religious content, particularly

249
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,120
that of Why I Starve, I'd love to see an explanation of why he presented himself as

250
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,680
a religious spokesperson.

251
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:45,480
Fousey is what his audience wants him to be, there is no real steadfast morality, and yet

252
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:49,360
he chooses to insert it into his videos to give him that reputability.

253
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:53,900
It is his quest to be the champion of the people, and yet his methods are so objectionable

254
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:57,840
it makes it hard for all the charity to ever feel justified.

255
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:01,320
And this was all exposed when he admitted the little of it was fake, he didn't have

256
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:06,120
any more to give to the genre, he'd smashed and grabbed, and it had given him something,

257
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,880
but he wasn't Drake's best mate.

258
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:08,880
What a shame.

259
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,180
The problem is that in spite of all the good things in the world you can do with that money

260
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:16,440
you make, the conventions were never particularly fond of pranksters because either they legitimately

261
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:19,680
created disorder within communities, or they falsely portrayed them.

262
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,600
Fousey thought his ends could justify the means, and unfortunately when you're a company,

263
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,840
a venue, anything at all, you have a reputation to uphold.

264
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:29,160
Why would you want someone who may cause disruption?

265
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:33,620
Fousey had a two-part plan, make himself famous, doing whatever he can, and then insert

266
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:36,240
himself into the mainstream eye by being a lovely bloke.

267
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:41,280
He didn't think there might be a qualification required of actually getting famous in a respectful

268
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:45,120
manner, and unfortunately he's not that special, no matter how many motivational speeches

269
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:49,040
he makes, and when the idea that you purposely gained weight just to lose it for the sole

270
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,980
motivation of a video is considered a credible theory, then you might want to take a look

271
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:56,400
at yourself in the mirror, after you've lost the weight of course.

272
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:00,240
And it was likely when he hosted a venue himself where only a few hundred people turned up,

273
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,780
that he realised that something wasn't quite right, and that he hadn't immortalised himself.

274
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:08,120
Many of us want a legacy, many of us want to be remembered, especially on this YouTube

275
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:12,400
platform, and I think Fousey has such grandiose visions of what he wants himself to be that

276
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,080
he's just not satisfied with what he already has.

277
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,080
Ironic.

278
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:20,300
He wants something immaterial, something to be remembered by, and when 375 people turn

279
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:23,520
up to your speech you realise you're being forgotten very quickly.

280
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,800
Fousey wants to be this leading figure in whatever genre he chooses.

281
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:30,600
The pranks gave him a significant amount of fame, but he didn't have the depth to carry

282
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,220
that through as a legacy.

283
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:36,240
So if you can't join them, then you just host FouseyCon.

284
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,600
It's very easy to look at what's happening and see FouseyCon as the eventual capitulation

285
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,160
of an internet persona.

286
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,360
What did it really represent to Fousey?

287
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,880
And above all, why did he choose to do it?

288
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:59,420
Judging from everything that I gathered from his older content, it's like he's on a

289
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:04,840
mission to create the ideal persona, the persona that is perfectly catered to gaining an internet

290
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:05,840
legacy.

291
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,840
However, the genres he chose in the past were not compatible with the type of effect that

292
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,040
he was looking for.

293
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:15,480
FouseyCon was just the point where everything broke, he got tired of trying to passively

294
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:20,380
slide his way into the life of a celebrity, so he just decided to forcefully insert himself

295
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:21,380
into it.

296
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:26,140
Whether it was Drake, LeBron James, DJ Khaled, I could go on as a large subscriber base,

297
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:27,140
10 million.

298
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:29,060
But it wasn't giving him the status that he desired.

299
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:34,420
The thing is, Fousey always crafted his image about being inspirational, about being grateful

300
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:37,640
for what you have and preaching all these moral messages, but deep down there was a

301
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:40,380
person incredibly dissatisfied with where they stood.

302
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:43,780
He was almost looking for a way to make his own personality sustainable.

303
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:47,540
He wanted to be invited to the parties, the conferences, the conventions, through the

304
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:52,100
notion of just existing, and making the occasional inspirational speech.

305
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:55,620
Unfortunately nothing he had ever done gave him that status, and he was still searching,

306
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:59,840
yet he made the very strange decision to become more invested within the commentary side of

307
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:05,140
YouTube, which really he should be doing the opposite, like all of the other ex-pranksters.

308
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:07,340
Commentary couldn't be more against Fousey.

309
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:10,800
Commentary is an absolute shitfest, make no mistake, but there is an extremely strong

310
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:14,860
moral compass when it comes to conduct, and what he'd get away with to his prank audience,

311
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:17,460
he'd be completely obliterated within commentary.

312
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:21,500
Ideally he should be isolating himself from these people and running back to the community

313
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:25,420
with the very unassuming fans, not the ones who are going to completely skewer him for

314
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:26,500
every misstep.

315
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:29,340
Why would he ever involve himself with such a group of people?

316
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:33,020
Well from my observations it's because Fousey has a very strange approach to reasoning that

317
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:34,120
makes his decisions.

318
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:38,120
He has a habit of acting impulsively, completely on emotional response, and then attempting

319
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:42,540
to create a logical argument surrounding it after he's already acted, even if that action

320
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:46,460
was incredibly wrong, which can make for some very interesting scenarios.

321
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:50,800
He threw himself into commentary because he saw the enticement of immediate attention,

322
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,180
but never considered that that may flail long term.

323
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:57,700
A famous example of his impulsive acts would be when he took down ColossalIsCrazy's video

324
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:01,380
on him, clearly angry that Colossal sought to challenge the image that he wanted others

325
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:02,380
to see.

326
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:05,820
However, Fousey made up a ridiculous explanation of why he did it, firstly saying that it's

327
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:10,060
incredulous that he should justify his actions, because the video was about him.

328
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:15,060
I mean, yes, of course, bar all the fair use laws and obviously the fact that people always

329
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:18,060
talk about other people is just a really stupid thing to say.

330
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:56,700
And then saying that he took it down because Colossal used footage of his mum and dad and

331
00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:01,140
dubbed over it, saying that he doesn't have to justify it before attempting to justify

332
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:04,900
it, while also ignoring the fact that he was more than happy to monetise and keep the video

333
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:08,780
up, allowing all those people to see Colossal mocking his family just as long as Fousey

334
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:10,060
was profiting off it.

335
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,860
It was embarrassing.

336
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:18,700
But the reason this video in particular caught my attention was because this video used footage

337
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:24,220
from my mum and dad, so the fact that I even have to justify any actions that I took against

338
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:27,940
the video that was made was just absolutely insane.

339
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:32,220
Fousey acts first and justifies later, and all this was on show with his latest event,

340
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:35,980
FouseyCon, an event which he arranged very quickly and boasts a load of huge names that

341
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:38,580
subsequently were proven to have never headlined anyway.

342
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:42,820
I have no doubt that Fousey planned to include Drake to have all these huge artists performing,

343
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:44,900
because Fousey probably envisioned it that way.

344
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,420
He set out a list of goals.

345
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:52,500
Together, that night we are going to dispel hate and change the frequency of life to love.

346
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:57,540
We are going to be, I'm declaring it right fucking now, YouTube's going to stream this

347
00:21:57,540 --> 00:22:02,380
event, it's going to be on the front page, it's going to have over 1 million concurrent

348
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:07,140
viewers, TMZ's going to be in the audience, you're going to be in the audience, news channels

349
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:14,660
are going to be in the audience, 5800 people sold out for free at the Greek theatre, okay?

350
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:19,220
And right then and there, all of us celebrating together, we're sending a message to the world

351
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:23,580
that from that day forward we're choosing love and we're going to kill this hate shit.

352
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:27,800
However, when many of us set out our own goals, we always attempt to manage expectations.

353
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:30,940
We wouldn't announce someone performing if they weren't confirmed.

354
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:32,360
Fousey doesn't think that way.

355
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:36,140
He thinks that with enough conviction, effort, and belief that it will just appear in your

356
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:37,140
lap.

357
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,140
So he promises it in advance.

358
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:40,140
But the world doesn't work out that way.

359
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:44,460
On top of that, Fousey often claims this principle that everything is part of a greater plan.

360
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:48,420
For some, this famous philosophy may help people react to unfortunate situations in

361
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:49,420
a collective fashion.

362
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:53,780
However, for Fousey, this allows him to devolve responsibility when things go wrong.

363
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:55,420
He can say and act how he wants.

364
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:58,060
If it doesn't happen, there must be a greater intervention.

365
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:02,780
Example, if Drake turns up, people will view him as a prophet and he pulled it off.

366
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:06,100
And if Drake doesn't, it just wasn't meant to be.

367
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,100
That's God's plan.

368
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:11,620
There are plenty of people who think his explanations are perfectly reasonable, perfectly sensible,

369
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:15,280
partly because of the way he carries himself, the sort of positive, look what I can do kind

370
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,740
of guy, where he talks about how he's going to make it through, in spite of all these

371
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:19,740
setbacks.

372
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:23,100
I always received the impression he's doing it to help his self-image, rather than help

373
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,100
those around him.

374
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:28,280
And that's the thing, in commentary, we don't give you a pass for just saying nice things.

375
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:31,740
Speaking morally doesn't somehow absolve your wrongful actions.

376
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:35,460
Another notable trait that came out of FouseyCon was how he responded to criticism.

377
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:39,500
Politically, all over the world recently, we've witnessed the rise of populist figures,

378
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:43,620
many of whom cherish the sort of mainstream establishment narrative that other publications

379
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:45,460
and media propagate against them.

380
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:49,620
Generally, what this point adopts is, these people have an ulterior agenda to stop me,

381
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:52,860
therefore they will purposely misframe everything to cater to that.

382
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:57,140
When people were challenging Fousey's testimony of how the situation unfolded, particularly

383
00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:01,900
figures like PewDiePie and DeFranco and Keemstar, he responded using this argument, you're

384
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:04,220
seeing it from your own biased perspective.

385
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:07,500
He was turning to them and saying, you have an agenda against me, so of course you're

386
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,700
not going to say anything nice about my event.

387
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:13,460
Now in some instances, the idea that someone might have an agenda to misrepresent your

388
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:18,420
situation can be a fairly legitimate argument, but given the amount of footage of the situation,

389
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:22,060
the idea that what occurred is taken out of context is highly unlikely.

390
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:26,180
Sure, people will have biased opinions on previous experiences, but that's the nature

391
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:30,440
of discourse, as long as the facts are clear then there's not much you can complain about.

392
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:33,740
This identifies another problem that I regularly observe about Fousey.

393
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:38,540
He has a habit of applying arguments that may be valid in certain circumstances to irrelevant

394
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:39,540
situations.

395
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:42,940
In the colossal situation, you could make the argument that what he did was disrespectful

396
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:46,460
to his family, you could argue that it was tactless, but then to go on and say that it

397
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:49,280
justified a takedown is completely illogical.

398
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:52,860
People may have an agenda against you, that doesn't mean that every time they say you

399
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:55,500
fucked up means that you haven't fucked up.

400
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:59,460
Other times his arguments may qualify as valid, but they're just a masquerade for the real

401
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:00,460
reason.

402
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:06,700
He then writes a tweet explaining that he did this because he felt that people were

403
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:12,420
too prone to following the crowd, and by disabling everything it gave people the full, unbiased

404
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:13,820
experience.

405
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:17,380
Wow, what a profit.

406
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:21,780
This fact may be true, but it also exposes inconsistencies that say a lot about Fousey's

407
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:22,780
principles.

408
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:26,780
Firstly, it's interesting considering he never disabled ratings on his old videos that

409
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:30,280
were well received by a majority of people, meaning that he only started caring about

410
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:34,360
influential opinions when they were against him, and secondly, we're not actually receiving

411
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:37,860
an unbiased look at the situation, we're receiving Fousey's look at it.

412
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:42,380
Thirdly, it's funny how once again he sought to explain this a while after actually doing

413
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:43,380
it.

414
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:45,940
As I said, act first, explain later.

415
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:50,100
And then he uses this argument that the event was free, so he's such a charitable man,

416
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:53,340
and it may have been free, but it's not free to travel there, people have shelled out money

417
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:55,980
to see Fousey who's made promises and let people down.

418
00:25:55,980 --> 00:26:00,380
He should apologise, and stop spewing out rhetoric which represents a failed visionary

419
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:02,480
who has dreamed more than he lived.

420
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,540
And sure, some people may have been inspired by his speech, but there are more efficient

421
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:08,840
ways to change people's lives than calling some of these people across the country for

422
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,260
a convention that wasn't really as promised.

423
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:15,740
But okay, according to The Blast, Drake never met the YouTuber, he was never booked for

424
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:18,620
Fousey's show, and he's never even heard of him.

425
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:22,060
Fousey has always had this dream of how he wants to be viewed, and how he wants people

426
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:23,060
to look at him.

427
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:27,300
He used to be this philosophical socialite, inspiring people to go out and act as he would,

428
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:31,400
but I believe the desperation to make it there firstly led him to highly questionable measures

429
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:35,980
with his prank videos, and eventually took him here, to a state which isn't good, isn't

430
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:39,300
healthy, and is just kinda destructive to certain people's lives.

431
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:43,940
Fousey has created such a reputation for himself that the only way to redeem it is to start

432
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:48,760
afresh, and even then, he'll have continuous mishaps hanging over him, he's had the time

433
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:51,700
to rectify his errors, and he hasn't taken it.

434
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:56,120
There are only so many chances you get, he had to do something new, and he had to make

435
00:26:56,120 --> 00:27:00,300
it happen, and no amount of post hoc justification can change what happened.

436
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:03,980
Some people have made this out to be a sudden turn of him, but I believe it's all completely

437
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:05,380
in line with his character.

438
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:08,520
The same traits are there, they've just been taken to new levels, in an attempt to

439
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,440
gain some form of traction.

440
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:14,240
If it worked, sure, it would have been fantastic, but there was an overwhelming probability

441
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,820
that it wouldn't, however sometimes when you're caught up in your own plans, you

442
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:18,820
don't see that.

443
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:23,700
Though I look forward to the countless explanations to come, for exactly why all of us are wrong,

444
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:28,820
and somehow a higher force has led us to be, and this is our destiny.

445
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:30,500
Makes perfect sense to me.

446
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:35,300
Anyhow, those were my thoughts on Fouseytube, and his recent turn.

447
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:39,220
I would love to hear your thoughts too in the comments below, I love a good open discussion,
