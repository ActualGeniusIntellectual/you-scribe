0	9000	Hello ladies and gentlemen and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with
9000	12900	too much free time, and here's a video that I never thought I'd do.
12900	13900	Why you may ask?
13900	19160	Well, to understand that we have to go back a couple of years, to 2016, when a YouTuber,
19160	22960	Colossalers, Crazy, you know, the one you twats won't stop comparing me to, released
22960	26840	his long overdue video on Fouseytube, named An Alternate Reality.
26880	31200	I was just initiating my interest into commentary, I'd had a YouTube channel for about 6 months,
31200	35160	but I'd been stuck in a bit of a rut and the videos I made were very niche.
35160	39380	People had messaged me from time to time saying, oh my god, you sound like Colossalers Crazy,
39380	42360	and although I didn't particularly hear the resemblance myself, I guess anyone with
42360	47160	a remotely posh accent sounds like clown to you bastards who don't live in the UK.
47160	50620	Alright you American knobs, I get that your freeways have gaps in between the size of
50620	52920	Buckingham Palace, but we're not all that local.
52920	56880	Anyhow, before I get carried away on that very unique tangent, the point is, I literally
56880	60560	knew no one, and I got ushered into his Discord server and then presented to his content,
60560	62920	and I'm not gonna lie, it was quite the encounter.
62920	67120	I'd never heard of Fousey, so this video was my introduction, and it was a pretty comprehensive
67120	69480	deconstruction of what Fousey stood for.
69480	73320	What I admired about it was that it managed to make a greater narrative on Fouseytube
73320	77440	as a person from mere surface value content, which is what I've always wanted to do with
77440	78440	my channel.
78440	81520	One of the responses that I loathe the most when criticising people is the line, you don't
81520	83840	know them, how can you talk about their intentions?
83840	89000	I do not know his intentions, but I have my opinions, based on what I have observed.
89000	93720	Fousey is a perfect example of how someone cannot explicitly commit any wrongdoings,
93720	97280	but have the most corrupted ideas of what he wants to gain from his content, and the
97280	98620	people watching it.
98620	102520	This is generally what I took away from Colossal's video, although these sample videos were limited,
102520	107040	he did a great job creating an elaborate character portrait, and really I didn't feel the necessity
107040	109180	to cover it any more than I did back in the day.
109180	113500	I did a video criticising his motivation to push a political agenda through his content,
113500	117580	as that was a bit more in my direction, and then his decision to copyright strike Colossal
117580	119700	for content that was clearly fair use.
119700	123180	My interaction with his content has been minimal otherwise.
123180	126880	And honestly, after he'd gone on a pretty prolonged hiatus, I thought I'd never deal
126880	129780	with him again, I mean, what more is there to know about him?
129780	134580	Admittedly, I wasn't that interested, I assumed he was just a shitty person in a powerful
134580	138100	position, but oh my, looks like we've got some revisiting to do.
138100	141500	Because recently, people have been claiming he's flying off the rails, into something
141500	146560	rather warring, something that not even the extensive lengths of Colossal's video covered.
146560	151020	A strange insanity that I felt the need to investigate, and perhaps explain.
151020	156020	You see, he planned and hosted something that was branded as Fusicon, it was marketed as
156020	161140	this big event with multiple artists, it basically was just Fusi having a massive trade with
161140	165760	a few musicians, and lit Pappy, the greatest artist of all time.
165760	170080	And speaking of music, Fusi has started releasing his own, which once again, he's more than
170080	171080	at liberty to.
171080	174560	However, regarding the convention, he made lots of wild claims, one of which was the
174560	178520	assertion that Drake was going to be performing, which apparently wasn't quite the case.
178520	183480	Well, wasn't the case at all, there is a ton of footage of him behaving extremely erratically
183480	187220	and impulsively, and it's very easy for commentators to look at him right now and
187220	192280	try and explain what's going on in the moment, because it is bizarre, very bizarre.
192280	196600	There are claims about his mental health, the idea that he's not on medication, bipolar,
196600	200660	depression, mania, and it's very possible, but there are other people with more of an
200660	204480	insight into that currently, so I'd ask you to go and check out those videos, because
204480	208680	I am many things, but I'm not quite rolling with the big boys of YouTube yet, though I'm
208680	212640	sure it's only a matter of time lads, until me and Daddy Keem are united.
212640	217400	Anyhow, before I lose myself in sweet daydreams of a better time, I need to discuss the man
217400	218720	in question, Fusitube.
218760	222280	Now, Colossal's still working on part two of his video, so I want to avoid stepping
222280	226280	on his toes, but I don't want it to be a surface level analysis either, so I'm gonna
226280	230240	try and give you a little cocktail with a little twist, a little fireball in there.
230240	234040	I'd also like to say that although it is important to be sensitive of whatever mental
234040	238320	conditions a person may suffer from, it doesn't necessarily alleviate criticism that can be
238320	243600	levied a person's way, especially as a public figure, which is why although I may be empathetic
243600	247880	to any disorders he's suffering from, I will be doing my best to keep his actions
247880	250240	separate from anything that may influence it.
250240	255840	As his career shows, he clearly has the capability to take some level of responsibility for himself.
255840	259680	Unfortunately, Fusi has placed himself in an occupation that is continuously in the
259680	264320	public eye, and as a functioning human being, he can't expect special treatment, especially
264320	269520	as he expects to exercise the same influence over those around him as his contemporaries.
269520	274700	So today what I plan to do is to have a good delve into the background of Fusitube, and
274700	284260	what may have led him down the road that took him to this.
284260	285260	Delicious.
285260	287580	There has to be an explanation.
287580	308100	So without further ado, let's get to it.
308100	311580	Everyone knows Fusi, but does anyone really know Yusuf Erekat?
311580	315220	I'm sure that's a question he throws around a lot towards his detractors.
315220	317140	Well let's have a look into his history.
317140	321520	Fusi is obviously notorious for his pranks, a little escapade that we'll definitely
321520	326020	investigate sooner or later, however he started his channel in a different direction, comedy.
326020	330000	This wasn't a fruitless venture either, in fact it was highly fortuitous for him.
330000	334140	His video on Middle Eastern parents was reported to have garnered over 2 million views by 2012,
334140	336020	and it makes sense in a way.
336020	340660	He tapped into a very popular element of comedy, stereotypes, and satirised them to a classic
340660	345000	early 2010s effect, where the intention was favoured over the execution.
345000	348440	I could bash into how he's kind of pouring out his ethnicity, but I don't think that's
348440	353320	a worthwhile discussion, as I think you can't really prove anything, well not yet at least,
353320	357280	apart from the fact that his degree in theatre arts clearly didn't cover font design.
357280	359480	Oh yes, that's sexy.
359480	364400	But you know what, it's passable, inoffensive comedy, and it clearly resonated with an audience,
364400	365640	especially on Tumblr.
365640	366640	What else would I expect?
366640	371720	It was 2011, comedy was tame, let's players were big, everything was just about being
371720	375960	loud, expressive, and eye-catching, rather than really being challenging to the viewer.
375960	377800	So it did that, and people watched it.
377800	381760	A lot of what happened around this time is now privated, however, he did have a very
381760	385360	interesting interview, which weirdly echoed some of the stuff he said last week.
385360	389160	In one of the Fousey videos at the time, the dance dare one was shown on Ellen.
389160	392960	In this interview with the Mercury News, he said how his short-term goal was to get on
392960	393960	her show.
393960	398720	Next week, I'll be sitting with Ellen telling her how I pulled this off.
398720	399720	Interesting.
399720	404400	Generally, he's documented in this early period as being this very charitable bloke,
404400	408180	doing all these nice things, saying all this pseudo-inspirational bollocks.
408180	412400	His Twitter archive has been pretty much wiped, apart from a selection of tweets, including
412400	414280	this fantastic quote.
414280	416960	They can't stop me, even if they stop me.
416960	419680	Winston Churchill has tears in his eyes, mate.
419680	422080	Or also, he's always had a hard-on for Drake.
422080	423920	But like Drake likes to say,
423920	426520	Better late than never, but never late is better.
426520	430440	There was something missing from his content, and that was intellect.
430440	434480	For me, as a casual observer, it's clear that he wanted to be noticed by the mainstream
434480	435480	world.
435480	438120	He wanted to be seen as someone who could be this voice of reason.
438120	442360	He had already been regarded as an icon for many Muslims, due to the religious overtones
442360	443360	in his content.
443360	445720	However, he wanted to go one step further.
445720	449720	So once the water was tested with these skip videos, he turned to more thoughtful content.
449720	453820	Fousey, being a theatre student, was clearly familiar with dramatic tone, and knew how
453820	457900	to pace his videos to appease an audience looking for content that was competent, but
457900	458900	fairly un-cinematic.
458900	464020	However, the simplicity does allow for the heavy-handed messages to come through even
464020	467940	more, and probably give it plenty of shareability to all your aunties on Facebook.
467940	470540	However, on closer analysis, they're not the best.
470540	474240	Obviously, in context, these videos are a few years old, and it's quite incredible
474240	478340	how stands of content creation have evolved over the space of these few years.
478340	482300	However, the production values aren't really what I'm concerned about.
482300	488100	Having social commentary, especially as an inspirational bloke, is easy, as long as it's
488100	492020	not under the microscope, and back then, with a sentimental piano, you could practically
492020	493020	do anything.
493020	497180	But ladies and gentlemen, the right opinion is not won over that easily.
497180	498360	I'm a hard man.
498360	504620	His first attempt was this poem, which has river flows in you in the background, but
504620	509460	the topic was too vague, and was not hot button enough to get the views, though you can definitely
509460	511300	see what direction he is heading in.
511340	515100	Honestly, the first time he really tried to hit home with a deeper message was with his
515100	520500	video Ramadam Nightmare, which I think is meant to be some sort of dystopian comic sketch,
520500	522740	which is rather tonally confused.
522740	526300	Part of it is the normal, huh, funny because relatable, but then at the end there's just
526300	530500	this montage of all these people suffering, and a message to the tune of stop looking
530500	534760	at what you don't have, and start being thankful for what you do have, which made the right
534760	537620	opinion deduced from the fucking placard at the end.
537620	540140	This is a message that is worth saving for later.
540180	544980	However, nothing can really top Why I Starve, a Ramadam tale, in which he gives a lecture
544980	545980	on Ramadam.
545980	550420	Like his other video, it was generally with the same morale, with a slightly more creative
550420	551420	delivery.
551420	570600	And we have to be clear here, although we may find it funny in how contrived it is,
570600	575280	a lot of people really connected with this content and the humbleness that he promulgated.
575280	578320	He seemed like a messiah to many people within his fanbase.
578320	582920	This was repeated on a regular basis, some strawman would act ignorant, and then Fousey
582920	587160	would swing in and give some inspiring speech which kinda already explains something that
587160	591460	people know, just in a more self-righteous fashion, but that's most motivational speakers
591460	592620	so who cares anyway.
592620	597000	He also had his third channel, known as Fouseyville, which sounds like a nightmarish district of
597000	601040	Disneyworld, but he uploaded content on there a bit too, and although I found a few unlisted
601040	605500	videos, the one that I really wanted to know what happened to was his video Keep Religion
605500	615880	Out Of It, which some very special man decided to respond to.
615880	620520	But one can only wonder what he preached, he also had a video posted which had a title
620520	624540	like he was behind the scenes on a Drake video, once again a recurring theme.
624540	629520	Fousey positioned himself as a man of virtue, a man of wisdom, and to the casual viewer,
629520	631020	it might well seem like that.
631020	635680	Fousey was clearly at this point going in a direction that gave his content a more religious
635680	640280	philosophical edge, he had constructed his content off his own identity, and outside
640280	645280	of our horrible judgmental commentary sphere, his delivery, albeit preachy, would come across
645280	648400	as serviceable because of its marred mannered intentions.
648400	653240	However Fousey encountered a significant problem with his content, simply that his fanbase
653240	657280	wasn't really the one that would fulfil his dream, it wasn't the fanbase that was
657280	660620	going to get him in touch with Drake, it wasn't the content that was going to have
660620	665180	him propelled into the public spotlight, after all the most devoted sector of his fanbase,
665180	668700	you know the ones who are going to turn up to meet you, were highly predominantly Muslim,
668700	672380	and although there's nothing wrong with that, it also means that being an American,
672380	676440	the population of your viewership is a bit more dispersed, they're just not enough
676440	678840	to get Fousey where he wanted to be.
678840	683460	Which was this position of sheer autonomy, this guru, this absolute celebrity, who would
683460	690140	take the news for a slice of toast, but he was still looking for his bread and butter.
690140	693800	So at this point, Fousey's videos are doing fine for views, but let's be honest, he's
693800	697700	not making the splash that he wanted to, he's going to some conventions, doing some talks,
697700	701160	but he's not devout enough to become a moral religious figure, and not culturally relevant
701160	703260	enough to become a bona fide celebrity.
703260	706320	So he turned to Prank, providing that none had been unlisted.
706320	710560	The first visible video is the Hold My Hand Prank, which was quite the segue from Blame
710560	712820	the Terrorist, another serious video.
712820	718100	These are the type of people and the type of reasons I hate YouTube social experiments
718100	719100	now.
719100	720100	It's disgusting.
720100	722720	However much alike to his sketch videos, he took a similar approach.
722720	727120	The first set of pranks were to test the water, they cover fairly harmless topics, to me they've
727120	730560	always been awkward and unfunny, but plenty of people like them.
730560	734840	Generally I believe the appeal to these pranks is the reaction of the subjects, in part.
734840	738720	I think the audience has taken interest in the human condition, and nothing is more authentic
738720	742640	than a covert observation in which people react to an absurd situation, it's both
742640	743980	real and dramatic.
743980	747920	Now obviously, with the knowledge that these are all fake, this appeal is undermined, but
747920	751740	back then there was an extremely large demographic who went in with the premise that this was
751740	756000	all real, it probably never crossed their minds that it was staged, after all, why would
756000	757000	it?
757000	760720	However, it all upped Knapp when he decided to integrate his social commentary with his
760720	761720	pranks.
761720	764240	Colossal covered this fairly comprehensively in his video, so once again, go and check
764240	765240	his out.
765240	769920	To summarise, whereas his sketches with social commentary were obviously theatrically performed,
769920	773280	Fusi used the title of Social Experiments to present these staged scenarios.
773280	777720	The problem is that he often exploited hot button topics for the quote good cause or
777720	778880	some moral lecture.
778880	782840	However, the audience ate this up, because a serious look at humans was great for not
782840	787380	just clickbait, but also fantastic for any shitty Facebook page to scream, oh my god,
787380	788920	look at how horrible people are.
788920	791840	It's a diabolical tactic, but it worked.
791840	797200	Fun fact, fake news is much more readily shared by humans than robots, because of how emotionally
797200	798600	provocative it is.
798600	803280	Fusi himself even had these antics documented in certain articles, most notably the highly
803280	805140	reputable Huffington Post.
805140	809160	It worked at the time because it catered to people's agendas, however it wasn't smiles
809160	810160	all round.
810160	813400	In Colossal's video he clearly documents how Fusi tries to defend his actions through
813400	816740	appealing to a higher morality, and how that appeal is misguided.
816740	820800	Some may say that it was an attempt to hold on to fans, but for me it was a self-justification
820800	822440	for his own actions.
822440	826720	Fusi had built something that he had finally wanted to, he had a huge subscriber base and
826720	831840	he wanted to do stuff with it, he wanted to pose as the moral icon, and with the monumental
831840	836920	momentum, he reinvigorated his sort of FusiVille content on Dose of Fusi, in which he'd typically
836920	841560	do rather unexceptional vlogs, followed by a deep speech with swelling music.
841560	845280	Unfortunately for commentators, the ends did not justify the means, and that's the thing
845280	849120	that Fusi did not necessarily count on, and once all these pranks or social experiments
849120	853440	were revealed as faked, their whole reputation was tainted.
853440	857040	Nowadays it's no secret that a lot of these pranksters were absolute moral vacuums.
857040	861240	I look at individuals like Roman Atwood and see him trying to sell himself as a salt of
861240	865620	the earth family man, and I laugh, but there are people who absolutely love it, people
865620	868820	who eat that shit up every single day.
868820	874260	People loved Fusi, people still love Fusi, he made his chunk a hub for motivational speeches,
874260	878840	which is what he clearly always wanted to be, a motivator, famed for his kind deeds,
878880	884040	good messages, and philanthropy, and his social experiments gave him the platform to finally
884040	885040	do that.
885040	889720	He had that inspirational Wake video for example, which has now garnered 15 million views, and
889720	894040	make no mistake, I'm sure it inspired some people, and now he had a new audience, what
894040	896920	about that old religious image that he built?
896920	901960	I hate all religion, the reason I hate all religion is because religion is the reason
901960	907040	for our wars, religion is the reason people are killing each other in different countries,
907040	911720	religion is the reason people can't even live in the same land, religion is the reason
911720	916280	that people, you know, why we have so much animosity in the world, why there's so much
916280	919080	drama going on on the news, it's disgusting.
919080	920480	Well to hell with that then.
920480	924240	And make no mistake, he may have changed his position, but such an incredible shift, it's
924240	927820	hard to put down to time, particularly as he recently put out this image, explained
927820	931480	that he hadn't prayed with pure intentions since he was 13.
931480	935000	Considering he was in his early 20s when he made his more religious content, particularly
935000	939120	that of Why I Starve, I'd love to see an explanation of why he presented himself as
939120	940680	a religious spokesperson.
940680	945480	Fousey is what his audience wants him to be, there is no real steadfast morality, and yet
945480	949360	he chooses to insert it into his videos to give him that reputability.
949360	953900	It is his quest to be the champion of the people, and yet his methods are so objectionable
953900	957840	it makes it hard for all the charity to ever feel justified.
957840	961320	And this was all exposed when he admitted the little of it was fake, he didn't have
961320	966120	any more to give to the genre, he'd smashed and grabbed, and it had given him something,
966120	967880	but he wasn't Drake's best mate.
967880	968880	What a shame.
968880	972180	The problem is that in spite of all the good things in the world you can do with that money
972180	976440	you make, the conventions were never particularly fond of pranksters because either they legitimately
976440	979680	created disorder within communities, or they falsely portrayed them.
979680	983600	Fousey thought his ends could justify the means, and unfortunately when you're a company,
983600	986840	a venue, anything at all, you have a reputation to uphold.
986840	989160	Why would you want someone who may cause disruption?
989160	993620	Fousey had a two-part plan, make himself famous, doing whatever he can, and then insert
993620	996240	himself into the mainstream eye by being a lovely bloke.
996240	1001280	He didn't think there might be a qualification required of actually getting famous in a respectful
1001280	1005120	manner, and unfortunately he's not that special, no matter how many motivational speeches
1005120	1009040	he makes, and when the idea that you purposely gained weight just to lose it for the sole
1009040	1012980	motivation of a video is considered a credible theory, then you might want to take a look
1012980	1016400	at yourself in the mirror, after you've lost the weight of course.
1016400	1020240	And it was likely when he hosted a venue himself where only a few hundred people turned up,
1020240	1024780	that he realised that something wasn't quite right, and that he hadn't immortalised himself.
1024780	1028120	Many of us want a legacy, many of us want to be remembered, especially on this YouTube
1028120	1032400	platform, and I think Fousey has such grandiose visions of what he wants himself to be that
1032400	1035080	he's just not satisfied with what he already has.
1035080	1036080	Ironic.
1036080	1040300	He wants something immaterial, something to be remembered by, and when 375 people turn
1040300	1043520	up to your speech you realise you're being forgotten very quickly.
1043520	1046800	Fousey wants to be this leading figure in whatever genre he chooses.
1046800	1050600	The pranks gave him a significant amount of fame, but he didn't have the depth to carry
1050600	1052220	that through as a legacy.
1052220	1056240	So if you can't join them, then you just host FouseyCon.
1065440	1069600	It's very easy to look at what's happening and see FouseyCon as the eventual capitulation
1069600	1071160	of an internet persona.
1071160	1073360	What did it really represent to Fousey?
1073360	1075880	And above all, why did he choose to do it?
1075880	1079420	Judging from everything that I gathered from his older content, it's like he's on a
1079420	1084840	mission to create the ideal persona, the persona that is perfectly catered to gaining an internet
1084840	1085840	legacy.
1085840	1089840	However, the genres he chose in the past were not compatible with the type of effect that
1089840	1091040	he was looking for.
1091040	1095480	FouseyCon was just the point where everything broke, he got tired of trying to passively
1095480	1100380	slide his way into the life of a celebrity, so he just decided to forcefully insert himself
1100380	1101380	into it.
1101380	1106140	Whether it was Drake, LeBron James, DJ Khaled, I could go on as a large subscriber base,
1106140	1107140	10 million.
1107140	1109060	But it wasn't giving him the status that he desired.
1109060	1114420	The thing is, Fousey always crafted his image about being inspirational, about being grateful
1114420	1117640	for what you have and preaching all these moral messages, but deep down there was a
1117640	1120380	person incredibly dissatisfied with where they stood.
1120380	1123780	He was almost looking for a way to make his own personality sustainable.
1123780	1127540	He wanted to be invited to the parties, the conferences, the conventions, through the
1127540	1132100	notion of just existing, and making the occasional inspirational speech.
1132100	1135620	Unfortunately nothing he had ever done gave him that status, and he was still searching,
1135620	1139840	yet he made the very strange decision to become more invested within the commentary side of
1139840	1145140	YouTube, which really he should be doing the opposite, like all of the other ex-pranksters.
1145140	1147340	Commentary couldn't be more against Fousey.
1147340	1150800	Commentary is an absolute shitfest, make no mistake, but there is an extremely strong
1150800	1154860	moral compass when it comes to conduct, and what he'd get away with to his prank audience,
1154860	1157460	he'd be completely obliterated within commentary.
1157460	1161500	Ideally he should be isolating himself from these people and running back to the community
1161500	1165420	with the very unassuming fans, not the ones who are going to completely skewer him for
1165420	1166500	every misstep.
1166500	1169340	Why would he ever involve himself with such a group of people?
1169340	1173020	Well from my observations it's because Fousey has a very strange approach to reasoning that
1173020	1174120	makes his decisions.
1174120	1178120	He has a habit of acting impulsively, completely on emotional response, and then attempting
1178120	1182540	to create a logical argument surrounding it after he's already acted, even if that action
1182540	1186460	was incredibly wrong, which can make for some very interesting scenarios.
1186460	1190800	He threw himself into commentary because he saw the enticement of immediate attention,
1190800	1193180	but never considered that that may flail long term.
1193180	1197700	A famous example of his impulsive acts would be when he took down ColossalIsCrazy's video
1197700	1201380	on him, clearly angry that Colossal sought to challenge the image that he wanted others
1201380	1202380	to see.
1202380	1205820	However, Fousey made up a ridiculous explanation of why he did it, firstly saying that it's
1205820	1210060	incredulous that he should justify his actions, because the video was about him.
1210060	1215060	I mean, yes, of course, bar all the fair use laws and obviously the fact that people always
1215060	1218060	talk about other people is just a really stupid thing to say.
1245060	1256700	And then saying that he took it down because Colossal used footage of his mum and dad and
1256700	1261140	dubbed over it, saying that he doesn't have to justify it before attempting to justify
1261140	1264900	it, while also ignoring the fact that he was more than happy to monetise and keep the video
1264900	1268780	up, allowing all those people to see Colossal mocking his family just as long as Fousey
1268780	1270060	was profiting off it.
1270060	1271860	It was embarrassing.
1271860	1278700	But the reason this video in particular caught my attention was because this video used footage
1278700	1284220	from my mum and dad, so the fact that I even have to justify any actions that I took against
1284220	1287940	the video that was made was just absolutely insane.
1287940	1292220	Fousey acts first and justifies later, and all this was on show with his latest event,
1292220	1295980	FouseyCon, an event which he arranged very quickly and boasts a load of huge names that
1295980	1298580	subsequently were proven to have never headlined anyway.
1298580	1302820	I have no doubt that Fousey planned to include Drake to have all these huge artists performing,
1302820	1304900	because Fousey probably envisioned it that way.
1304900	1306420	He set out a list of goals.
1306420	1312500	Together, that night we are going to dispel hate and change the frequency of life to love.
1312500	1317540	We are going to be, I'm declaring it right fucking now, YouTube's going to stream this
1317540	1322380	event, it's going to be on the front page, it's going to have over 1 million concurrent
1322380	1327140	viewers, TMZ's going to be in the audience, you're going to be in the audience, news channels
1327140	1334660	are going to be in the audience, 5800 people sold out for free at the Greek theatre, okay?
1334660	1339220	And right then and there, all of us celebrating together, we're sending a message to the world
1339220	1343580	that from that day forward we're choosing love and we're going to kill this hate shit.
1343580	1347800	However, when many of us set out our own goals, we always attempt to manage expectations.
1347800	1350940	We wouldn't announce someone performing if they weren't confirmed.
1350940	1352360	Fousey doesn't think that way.
1352360	1356140	He thinks that with enough conviction, effort, and belief that it will just appear in your
1356140	1357140	lap.
1357140	1358140	So he promises it in advance.
1358140	1360140	But the world doesn't work out that way.
1360140	1364460	On top of that, Fousey often claims this principle that everything is part of a greater plan.
1364460	1368420	For some, this famous philosophy may help people react to unfortunate situations in
1368420	1369420	a collective fashion.
1369420	1373780	However, for Fousey, this allows him to devolve responsibility when things go wrong.
1373780	1375420	He can say and act how he wants.
1375420	1378060	If it doesn't happen, there must be a greater intervention.
1378060	1382780	Example, if Drake turns up, people will view him as a prophet and he pulled it off.
1382780	1386100	And if Drake doesn't, it just wasn't meant to be.
1386100	1387100	That's God's plan.
1387100	1391620	There are plenty of people who think his explanations are perfectly reasonable, perfectly sensible,
1391620	1395280	partly because of the way he carries himself, the sort of positive, look what I can do kind
1395280	1398740	of guy, where he talks about how he's going to make it through, in spite of all these
1398740	1399740	setbacks.
1399740	1403100	I always received the impression he's doing it to help his self-image, rather than help
1403100	1404100	those around him.
1404100	1408280	And that's the thing, in commentary, we don't give you a pass for just saying nice things.
1408280	1411740	Speaking morally doesn't somehow absolve your wrongful actions.
1411740	1415460	Another notable trait that came out of FouseyCon was how he responded to criticism.
1415460	1419500	Politically, all over the world recently, we've witnessed the rise of populist figures,
1419500	1423620	many of whom cherish the sort of mainstream establishment narrative that other publications
1423620	1425460	and media propagate against them.
1425460	1429620	Generally, what this point adopts is, these people have an ulterior agenda to stop me,
1429620	1432860	therefore they will purposely misframe everything to cater to that.
1432860	1437140	When people were challenging Fousey's testimony of how the situation unfolded, particularly
1437140	1441900	figures like PewDiePie and DeFranco and Keemstar, he responded using this argument, you're
1441900	1444220	seeing it from your own biased perspective.
1444220	1447500	He was turning to them and saying, you have an agenda against me, so of course you're
1447500	1449700	not going to say anything nice about my event.
1449700	1453460	Now in some instances, the idea that someone might have an agenda to misrepresent your
1453460	1458420	situation can be a fairly legitimate argument, but given the amount of footage of the situation,
1458420	1462060	the idea that what occurred is taken out of context is highly unlikely.
1462060	1466180	Sure, people will have biased opinions on previous experiences, but that's the nature
1466180	1470440	of discourse, as long as the facts are clear then there's not much you can complain about.
1470440	1473740	This identifies another problem that I regularly observe about Fousey.
1473780	1478540	He has a habit of applying arguments that may be valid in certain circumstances to irrelevant
1478540	1479540	situations.
1479540	1482940	In the colossal situation, you could make the argument that what he did was disrespectful
1482940	1486460	to his family, you could argue that it was tactless, but then to go on and say that it
1486460	1489280	justified a takedown is completely illogical.
1489280	1492860	People may have an agenda against you, that doesn't mean that every time they say you
1492860	1495500	fucked up means that you haven't fucked up.
1495500	1499460	Other times his arguments may qualify as valid, but they're just a masquerade for the real
1499460	1500460	reason.
1500460	1506700	He then writes a tweet explaining that he did this because he felt that people were
1506700	1512420	too prone to following the crowd, and by disabling everything it gave people the full, unbiased
1512420	1513820	experience.
1513820	1517380	Wow, what a profit.
1517380	1521780	This fact may be true, but it also exposes inconsistencies that say a lot about Fousey's
1521780	1522780	principles.
1522780	1526780	Firstly, it's interesting considering he never disabled ratings on his old videos that
1526780	1530280	were well received by a majority of people, meaning that he only started caring about
1530280	1534360	influential opinions when they were against him, and secondly, we're not actually receiving
1534360	1537860	an unbiased look at the situation, we're receiving Fousey's look at it.
1537860	1542380	Thirdly, it's funny how once again he sought to explain this a while after actually doing
1542380	1543380	it.
1543380	1545940	As I said, act first, explain later.
1545940	1550100	And then he uses this argument that the event was free, so he's such a charitable man,
1550100	1553340	and it may have been free, but it's not free to travel there, people have shelled out money
1553340	1555980	to see Fousey who's made promises and let people down.
1555980	1560380	He should apologise, and stop spewing out rhetoric which represents a failed visionary
1560380	1562480	who has dreamed more than he lived.
1562480	1565540	And sure, some people may have been inspired by his speech, but there are more efficient
1565540	1568840	ways to change people's lives than calling some of these people across the country for
1568840	1571260	a convention that wasn't really as promised.
1571260	1575740	But okay, according to The Blast, Drake never met the YouTuber, he was never booked for
1575740	1578620	Fousey's show, and he's never even heard of him.
1578620	1582060	Fousey has always had this dream of how he wants to be viewed, and how he wants people
1582060	1583060	to look at him.
1583060	1587300	He used to be this philosophical socialite, inspiring people to go out and act as he would,
1587300	1591400	but I believe the desperation to make it there firstly led him to highly questionable measures
1591400	1595980	with his prank videos, and eventually took him here, to a state which isn't good, isn't
1595980	1599300	healthy, and is just kinda destructive to certain people's lives.
1599300	1603940	Fousey has created such a reputation for himself that the only way to redeem it is to start
1603940	1608760	afresh, and even then, he'll have continuous mishaps hanging over him, he's had the time
1608760	1611700	to rectify his errors, and he hasn't taken it.
1611700	1616120	There are only so many chances you get, he had to do something new, and he had to make
1616120	1620300	it happen, and no amount of post hoc justification can change what happened.
1620300	1623980	Some people have made this out to be a sudden turn of him, but I believe it's all completely
1623980	1625380	in line with his character.
1625380	1628520	The same traits are there, they've just been taken to new levels, in an attempt to
1628520	1630440	gain some form of traction.
1630440	1634240	If it worked, sure, it would have been fantastic, but there was an overwhelming probability
1634240	1637820	that it wouldn't, however sometimes when you're caught up in your own plans, you
1637820	1638820	don't see that.
1639140	1643700	Though I look forward to the countless explanations to come, for exactly why all of us are wrong,
1643700	1648820	and somehow a higher force has led us to be, and this is our destiny.
1648820	1650500	Makes perfect sense to me.
1650500	1655300	Anyhow, those were my thoughts on Fouseytube, and his recent turn.
1655300	1659220	I would love to hear your thoughts too in the comments below, I love a good open discussion,
