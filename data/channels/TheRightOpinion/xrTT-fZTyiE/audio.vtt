Hello ladies and gentlemen and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with

00:09.000 --> 00:12.900
too much free time, and here's a video that I never thought I'd do.

00:12.900 --> 00:13.900
Why you may ask?

00:13.900 --> 00:19.160
Well, to understand that we have to go back a couple of years, to 2016, when a YouTuber,

00:19.160 --> 00:22.960
Colossalers, Crazy, you know, the one you twats won't stop comparing me to, released

00:22.960 --> 00:26.840
his long overdue video on Fouseytube, named An Alternate Reality.

00:26.880 --> 00:31.200
I was just initiating my interest into commentary, I'd had a YouTube channel for about 6 months,

00:31.200 --> 00:35.160
but I'd been stuck in a bit of a rut and the videos I made were very niche.

00:35.160 --> 00:39.380
People had messaged me from time to time saying, oh my god, you sound like Colossalers Crazy,

00:39.380 --> 00:42.360
and although I didn't particularly hear the resemblance myself, I guess anyone with

00:42.360 --> 00:47.160
a remotely posh accent sounds like clown to you bastards who don't live in the UK.

00:47.160 --> 00:50.620
Alright you American knobs, I get that your freeways have gaps in between the size of

00:50.620 --> 00:52.920
Buckingham Palace, but we're not all that local.

00:52.920 --> 00:56.880
Anyhow, before I get carried away on that very unique tangent, the point is, I literally

00:56.880 --> 01:00.560
knew no one, and I got ushered into his Discord server and then presented to his content,

01:00.560 --> 01:02.920
and I'm not gonna lie, it was quite the encounter.

01:02.920 --> 01:07.120
I'd never heard of Fousey, so this video was my introduction, and it was a pretty comprehensive

01:07.120 --> 01:09.480
deconstruction of what Fousey stood for.

01:09.480 --> 01:13.320
What I admired about it was that it managed to make a greater narrative on Fouseytube

01:13.320 --> 01:17.440
as a person from mere surface value content, which is what I've always wanted to do with

01:17.440 --> 01:18.440
my channel.

01:18.440 --> 01:21.520
One of the responses that I loathe the most when criticising people is the line, you don't

01:21.520 --> 01:23.840
know them, how can you talk about their intentions?

01:23.840 --> 01:29.000
I do not know his intentions, but I have my opinions, based on what I have observed.

01:29.000 --> 01:33.720
Fousey is a perfect example of how someone cannot explicitly commit any wrongdoings,

01:33.720 --> 01:37.280
but have the most corrupted ideas of what he wants to gain from his content, and the

01:37.280 --> 01:38.620
people watching it.

01:38.620 --> 01:42.520
This is generally what I took away from Colossal's video, although these sample videos were limited,

01:42.520 --> 01:47.040
he did a great job creating an elaborate character portrait, and really I didn't feel the necessity

01:47.040 --> 01:49.180
to cover it any more than I did back in the day.

01:49.180 --> 01:53.500
I did a video criticising his motivation to push a political agenda through his content,

01:53.500 --> 01:57.580
as that was a bit more in my direction, and then his decision to copyright strike Colossal

01:57.580 --> 01:59.700
for content that was clearly fair use.

01:59.700 --> 02:03.180
My interaction with his content has been minimal otherwise.

02:03.180 --> 02:06.880
And honestly, after he'd gone on a pretty prolonged hiatus, I thought I'd never deal

02:06.880 --> 02:09.780
with him again, I mean, what more is there to know about him?

02:09.780 --> 02:14.580
Admittedly, I wasn't that interested, I assumed he was just a shitty person in a powerful

02:14.580 --> 02:18.100
position, but oh my, looks like we've got some revisiting to do.

02:18.100 --> 02:21.500
Because recently, people have been claiming he's flying off the rails, into something

02:21.500 --> 02:26.560
rather warring, something that not even the extensive lengths of Colossal's video covered.

02:26.560 --> 02:31.020
A strange insanity that I felt the need to investigate, and perhaps explain.

02:31.020 --> 02:36.020
You see, he planned and hosted something that was branded as Fusicon, it was marketed as

02:36.020 --> 02:41.140
this big event with multiple artists, it basically was just Fusi having a massive trade with

02:41.140 --> 02:45.760
a few musicians, and lit Pappy, the greatest artist of all time.

02:45.760 --> 02:50.080
And speaking of music, Fusi has started releasing his own, which once again, he's more than

02:50.080 --> 02:51.080
at liberty to.

02:51.080 --> 02:54.560
However, regarding the convention, he made lots of wild claims, one of which was the

02:54.560 --> 02:58.520
assertion that Drake was going to be performing, which apparently wasn't quite the case.

02:58.520 --> 03:03.480
Well, wasn't the case at all, there is a ton of footage of him behaving extremely erratically

03:03.480 --> 03:07.220
and impulsively, and it's very easy for commentators to look at him right now and

03:07.220 --> 03:12.280
try and explain what's going on in the moment, because it is bizarre, very bizarre.

03:12.280 --> 03:16.600
There are claims about his mental health, the idea that he's not on medication, bipolar,

03:16.600 --> 03:20.660
depression, mania, and it's very possible, but there are other people with more of an

03:20.660 --> 03:24.480
insight into that currently, so I'd ask you to go and check out those videos, because

03:24.480 --> 03:28.680
I am many things, but I'm not quite rolling with the big boys of YouTube yet, though I'm

03:28.680 --> 03:32.640
sure it's only a matter of time lads, until me and Daddy Keem are united.

03:32.640 --> 03:37.400
Anyhow, before I lose myself in sweet daydreams of a better time, I need to discuss the man

03:37.400 --> 03:38.720
in question, Fusitube.

03:38.760 --> 03:42.280
Now, Colossal's still working on part two of his video, so I want to avoid stepping

03:42.280 --> 03:46.280
on his toes, but I don't want it to be a surface level analysis either, so I'm gonna

03:46.280 --> 03:50.240
try and give you a little cocktail with a little twist, a little fireball in there.

03:50.240 --> 03:54.040
I'd also like to say that although it is important to be sensitive of whatever mental

03:54.040 --> 03:58.320
conditions a person may suffer from, it doesn't necessarily alleviate criticism that can be

03:58.320 --> 04:03.600
levied a person's way, especially as a public figure, which is why although I may be empathetic

04:03.600 --> 04:07.880
to any disorders he's suffering from, I will be doing my best to keep his actions

04:07.880 --> 04:10.240
separate from anything that may influence it.

04:10.240 --> 04:15.840
As his career shows, he clearly has the capability to take some level of responsibility for himself.

04:15.840 --> 04:19.680
Unfortunately, Fusi has placed himself in an occupation that is continuously in the

04:19.680 --> 04:24.320
public eye, and as a functioning human being, he can't expect special treatment, especially

04:24.320 --> 04:29.520
as he expects to exercise the same influence over those around him as his contemporaries.

04:29.520 --> 04:34.700
So today what I plan to do is to have a good delve into the background of Fusitube, and

04:34.700 --> 04:44.260
what may have led him down the road that took him to this.

04:44.260 --> 04:45.260
Delicious.

04:45.260 --> 04:47.580
There has to be an explanation.

04:47.580 --> 05:08.100
So without further ado, let's get to it.

05:08.100 --> 05:11.580
Everyone knows Fusi, but does anyone really know Yusuf Erekat?

05:11.580 --> 05:15.220
I'm sure that's a question he throws around a lot towards his detractors.

05:15.220 --> 05:17.140
Well let's have a look into his history.

05:17.140 --> 05:21.520
Fusi is obviously notorious for his pranks, a little escapade that we'll definitely

05:21.520 --> 05:26.020
investigate sooner or later, however he started his channel in a different direction, comedy.

05:26.020 --> 05:30.000
This wasn't a fruitless venture either, in fact it was highly fortuitous for him.

05:30.000 --> 05:34.140
His video on Middle Eastern parents was reported to have garnered over 2 million views by 2012,

05:34.140 --> 05:36.020
and it makes sense in a way.

05:36.020 --> 05:40.660
He tapped into a very popular element of comedy, stereotypes, and satirised them to a classic

05:40.660 --> 05:45.000
early 2010s effect, where the intention was favoured over the execution.

05:45.000 --> 05:48.440
I could bash into how he's kind of pouring out his ethnicity, but I don't think that's

05:48.440 --> 05:53.320
a worthwhile discussion, as I think you can't really prove anything, well not yet at least,

05:53.320 --> 05:57.280
apart from the fact that his degree in theatre arts clearly didn't cover font design.

05:57.280 --> 05:59.480
Oh yes, that's sexy.

05:59.480 --> 06:04.400
But you know what, it's passable, inoffensive comedy, and it clearly resonated with an audience,

06:04.400 --> 06:05.640
especially on Tumblr.

06:05.640 --> 06:06.640
What else would I expect?

06:06.640 --> 06:11.720
It was 2011, comedy was tame, let's players were big, everything was just about being

06:11.720 --> 06:15.960
loud, expressive, and eye-catching, rather than really being challenging to the viewer.

06:15.960 --> 06:17.800
So it did that, and people watched it.

06:17.800 --> 06:21.760
A lot of what happened around this time is now privated, however, he did have a very

06:21.760 --> 06:25.360
interesting interview, which weirdly echoed some of the stuff he said last week.

06:25.360 --> 06:29.160
In one of the Fousey videos at the time, the dance dare one was shown on Ellen.

06:29.160 --> 06:32.960
In this interview with the Mercury News, he said how his short-term goal was to get on

06:32.960 --> 06:33.960
her show.

06:33.960 --> 06:38.720
Next week, I'll be sitting with Ellen telling her how I pulled this off.

06:38.720 --> 06:39.720
Interesting.

06:39.720 --> 06:44.400
Generally, he's documented in this early period as being this very charitable bloke,

06:44.400 --> 06:48.180
doing all these nice things, saying all this pseudo-inspirational bollocks.

06:48.180 --> 06:52.400
His Twitter archive has been pretty much wiped, apart from a selection of tweets, including

06:52.400 --> 06:54.280
this fantastic quote.

06:54.280 --> 06:56.960
They can't stop me, even if they stop me.

06:56.960 --> 06:59.680
Winston Churchill has tears in his eyes, mate.

06:59.680 --> 07:02.080
Or also, he's always had a hard-on for Drake.

07:02.080 --> 07:03.920
But like Drake likes to say,

07:03.920 --> 07:06.520
Better late than never, but never late is better.

07:06.520 --> 07:10.440
There was something missing from his content, and that was intellect.

07:10.440 --> 07:14.480
For me, as a casual observer, it's clear that he wanted to be noticed by the mainstream

07:14.480 --> 07:15.480
world.

07:15.480 --> 07:18.120
He wanted to be seen as someone who could be this voice of reason.

07:18.120 --> 07:22.360
He had already been regarded as an icon for many Muslims, due to the religious overtones

07:22.360 --> 07:23.360
in his content.

07:23.360 --> 07:25.720
However, he wanted to go one step further.

07:25.720 --> 07:29.720
So once the water was tested with these skip videos, he turned to more thoughtful content.

07:29.720 --> 07:33.820
Fousey, being a theatre student, was clearly familiar with dramatic tone, and knew how

07:33.820 --> 07:37.900
to pace his videos to appease an audience looking for content that was competent, but

07:37.900 --> 07:38.900
fairly un-cinematic.

07:38.900 --> 07:44.020
However, the simplicity does allow for the heavy-handed messages to come through even

07:44.020 --> 07:47.940
more, and probably give it plenty of shareability to all your aunties on Facebook.

07:47.940 --> 07:50.540
However, on closer analysis, they're not the best.

07:50.540 --> 07:54.240
Obviously, in context, these videos are a few years old, and it's quite incredible

07:54.240 --> 07:58.340
how stands of content creation have evolved over the space of these few years.

07:58.340 --> 08:02.300
However, the production values aren't really what I'm concerned about.

08:02.300 --> 08:08.100
Having social commentary, especially as an inspirational bloke, is easy, as long as it's

08:08.100 --> 08:12.020
not under the microscope, and back then, with a sentimental piano, you could practically

08:12.020 --> 08:13.020
do anything.

08:13.020 --> 08:17.180
But ladies and gentlemen, the right opinion is not won over that easily.

08:17.180 --> 08:18.360
I'm a hard man.

08:18.360 --> 08:24.620
His first attempt was this poem, which has river flows in you in the background, but

08:24.620 --> 08:29.460
the topic was too vague, and was not hot button enough to get the views, though you can definitely

08:29.460 --> 08:31.300
see what direction he is heading in.

08:31.340 --> 08:35.100
Honestly, the first time he really tried to hit home with a deeper message was with his

08:35.100 --> 08:40.500
video Ramadam Nightmare, which I think is meant to be some sort of dystopian comic sketch,

08:40.500 --> 08:42.740
which is rather tonally confused.

08:42.740 --> 08:46.300
Part of it is the normal, huh, funny because relatable, but then at the end there's just

08:46.300 --> 08:50.500
this montage of all these people suffering, and a message to the tune of stop looking

08:50.500 --> 08:54.760
at what you don't have, and start being thankful for what you do have, which made the right

08:54.760 --> 08:57.620
opinion deduced from the fucking placard at the end.

08:57.620 --> 09:00.140
This is a message that is worth saving for later.

09:00.180 --> 09:04.980
However, nothing can really top Why I Starve, a Ramadam tale, in which he gives a lecture

09:04.980 --> 09:05.980
on Ramadam.

09:05.980 --> 09:10.420
Like his other video, it was generally with the same morale, with a slightly more creative

09:10.420 --> 09:11.420
delivery.

09:11.420 --> 09:30.600
And we have to be clear here, although we may find it funny in how contrived it is,

09:30.600 --> 09:35.280
a lot of people really connected with this content and the humbleness that he promulgated.

09:35.280 --> 09:38.320
He seemed like a messiah to many people within his fanbase.

09:38.320 --> 09:42.920
This was repeated on a regular basis, some strawman would act ignorant, and then Fousey

09:42.920 --> 09:47.160
would swing in and give some inspiring speech which kinda already explains something that

09:47.160 --> 09:51.460
people know, just in a more self-righteous fashion, but that's most motivational speakers

09:51.460 --> 09:52.620
so who cares anyway.

09:52.620 --> 09:57.000
He also had his third channel, known as Fouseyville, which sounds like a nightmarish district of

09:57.000 --> 10:01.040
Disneyworld, but he uploaded content on there a bit too, and although I found a few unlisted

10:01.040 --> 10:05.500
videos, the one that I really wanted to know what happened to was his video Keep Religion

10:05.500 --> 10:15.880
Out Of It, which some very special man decided to respond to.

10:15.880 --> 10:20.520
But one can only wonder what he preached, he also had a video posted which had a title

10:20.520 --> 10:24.540
like he was behind the scenes on a Drake video, once again a recurring theme.

10:24.540 --> 10:29.520
Fousey positioned himself as a man of virtue, a man of wisdom, and to the casual viewer,

10:29.520 --> 10:31.020
it might well seem like that.

10:31.020 --> 10:35.680
Fousey was clearly at this point going in a direction that gave his content a more religious

10:35.680 --> 10:40.280
philosophical edge, he had constructed his content off his own identity, and outside

10:40.280 --> 10:45.280
of our horrible judgmental commentary sphere, his delivery, albeit preachy, would come across

10:45.280 --> 10:48.400
as serviceable because of its marred mannered intentions.

10:48.400 --> 10:53.240
However Fousey encountered a significant problem with his content, simply that his fanbase

10:53.240 --> 10:57.280
wasn't really the one that would fulfil his dream, it wasn't the fanbase that was

10:57.280 --> 11:00.620
going to get him in touch with Drake, it wasn't the content that was going to have

11:00.620 --> 11:05.180
him propelled into the public spotlight, after all the most devoted sector of his fanbase,

11:05.180 --> 11:08.700
you know the ones who are going to turn up to meet you, were highly predominantly Muslim,

11:08.700 --> 11:12.380
and although there's nothing wrong with that, it also means that being an American,

11:12.380 --> 11:16.440
the population of your viewership is a bit more dispersed, they're just not enough

11:16.440 --> 11:18.840
to get Fousey where he wanted to be.

11:18.840 --> 11:23.460
Which was this position of sheer autonomy, this guru, this absolute celebrity, who would

11:23.460 --> 11:30.140
take the news for a slice of toast, but he was still looking for his bread and butter.

11:30.140 --> 11:33.800
So at this point, Fousey's videos are doing fine for views, but let's be honest, he's

11:33.800 --> 11:37.700
not making the splash that he wanted to, he's going to some conventions, doing some talks,

11:37.700 --> 11:41.160
but he's not devout enough to become a moral religious figure, and not culturally relevant

11:41.160 --> 11:43.260
enough to become a bona fide celebrity.

11:43.260 --> 11:46.320
So he turned to Prank, providing that none had been unlisted.

11:46.320 --> 11:50.560
The first visible video is the Hold My Hand Prank, which was quite the segue from Blame

11:50.560 --> 11:52.820
the Terrorist, another serious video.

11:52.820 --> 11:58.100
These are the type of people and the type of reasons I hate YouTube social experiments

11:58.100 --> 11:59.100
now.

11:59.100 --> 12:00.100
It's disgusting.

12:00.100 --> 12:02.720
However much alike to his sketch videos, he took a similar approach.

12:02.720 --> 12:07.120
The first set of pranks were to test the water, they cover fairly harmless topics, to me they've

12:07.120 --> 12:10.560
always been awkward and unfunny, but plenty of people like them.

12:10.560 --> 12:14.840
Generally I believe the appeal to these pranks is the reaction of the subjects, in part.

12:14.840 --> 12:18.720
I think the audience has taken interest in the human condition, and nothing is more authentic

12:18.720 --> 12:22.640
than a covert observation in which people react to an absurd situation, it's both

12:22.640 --> 12:23.980
real and dramatic.

12:23.980 --> 12:27.920
Now obviously, with the knowledge that these are all fake, this appeal is undermined, but

12:27.920 --> 12:31.740
back then there was an extremely large demographic who went in with the premise that this was

12:31.740 --> 12:36.000
all real, it probably never crossed their minds that it was staged, after all, why would

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
it?

12:37.000 --> 12:40.720
However, it all upped Knapp when he decided to integrate his social commentary with his

12:40.720 --> 12:41.720
pranks.

12:41.720 --> 12:44.240
Colossal covered this fairly comprehensively in his video, so once again, go and check

12:44.240 --> 12:45.240
his out.

12:45.240 --> 12:49.920
To summarise, whereas his sketches with social commentary were obviously theatrically performed,

12:49.920 --> 12:53.280
Fusi used the title of Social Experiments to present these staged scenarios.

12:53.280 --> 12:57.720
The problem is that he often exploited hot button topics for the quote good cause or

12:57.720 --> 12:58.880
some moral lecture.

12:58.880 --> 13:02.840
However, the audience ate this up, because a serious look at humans was great for not

13:02.840 --> 13:07.380
just clickbait, but also fantastic for any shitty Facebook page to scream, oh my god,

13:07.380 --> 13:08.920
look at how horrible people are.

13:08.920 --> 13:11.840
It's a diabolical tactic, but it worked.

13:11.840 --> 13:17.200
Fun fact, fake news is much more readily shared by humans than robots, because of how emotionally

13:17.200 --> 13:18.600
provocative it is.

13:18.600 --> 13:23.280
Fusi himself even had these antics documented in certain articles, most notably the highly

13:23.280 --> 13:25.140
reputable Huffington Post.

13:25.140 --> 13:29.160
It worked at the time because it catered to people's agendas, however it wasn't smiles

13:29.160 --> 13:30.160
all round.

13:30.160 --> 13:33.400
In Colossal's video he clearly documents how Fusi tries to defend his actions through

13:33.400 --> 13:36.740
appealing to a higher morality, and how that appeal is misguided.

13:36.740 --> 13:40.800
Some may say that it was an attempt to hold on to fans, but for me it was a self-justification

13:40.800 --> 13:42.440
for his own actions.

13:42.440 --> 13:46.720
Fusi had built something that he had finally wanted to, he had a huge subscriber base and

13:46.720 --> 13:51.840
he wanted to do stuff with it, he wanted to pose as the moral icon, and with the monumental

13:51.840 --> 13:56.920
momentum, he reinvigorated his sort of FusiVille content on Dose of Fusi, in which he'd typically

13:56.920 --> 14:01.560
do rather unexceptional vlogs, followed by a deep speech with swelling music.

14:01.560 --> 14:05.280
Unfortunately for commentators, the ends did not justify the means, and that's the thing

14:05.280 --> 14:09.120
that Fusi did not necessarily count on, and once all these pranks or social experiments

14:09.120 --> 14:13.440
were revealed as faked, their whole reputation was tainted.

14:13.440 --> 14:17.040
Nowadays it's no secret that a lot of these pranksters were absolute moral vacuums.

14:17.040 --> 14:21.240
I look at individuals like Roman Atwood and see him trying to sell himself as a salt of

14:21.240 --> 14:25.620
the earth family man, and I laugh, but there are people who absolutely love it, people

14:25.620 --> 14:28.820
who eat that shit up every single day.

14:28.820 --> 14:34.260
People loved Fusi, people still love Fusi, he made his chunk a hub for motivational speeches,

14:34.260 --> 14:38.840
which is what he clearly always wanted to be, a motivator, famed for his kind deeds,

14:38.880 --> 14:44.040
good messages, and philanthropy, and his social experiments gave him the platform to finally

14:44.040 --> 14:45.040
do that.

14:45.040 --> 14:49.720
He had that inspirational Wake video for example, which has now garnered 15 million views, and

14:49.720 --> 14:54.040
make no mistake, I'm sure it inspired some people, and now he had a new audience, what

14:54.040 --> 14:56.920
about that old religious image that he built?

14:56.920 --> 15:01.960
I hate all religion, the reason I hate all religion is because religion is the reason

15:01.960 --> 15:07.040
for our wars, religion is the reason people are killing each other in different countries,

15:07.040 --> 15:11.720
religion is the reason people can't even live in the same land, religion is the reason

15:11.720 --> 15:16.280
that people, you know, why we have so much animosity in the world, why there's so much

15:16.280 --> 15:19.080
drama going on on the news, it's disgusting.

15:19.080 --> 15:20.480
Well to hell with that then.

15:20.480 --> 15:24.240
And make no mistake, he may have changed his position, but such an incredible shift, it's

15:24.240 --> 15:27.820
hard to put down to time, particularly as he recently put out this image, explained

15:27.820 --> 15:31.480
that he hadn't prayed with pure intentions since he was 13.

15:31.480 --> 15:35.000
Considering he was in his early 20s when he made his more religious content, particularly

15:35.000 --> 15:39.120
that of Why I Starve, I'd love to see an explanation of why he presented himself as

15:39.120 --> 15:40.680
a religious spokesperson.

15:40.680 --> 15:45.480
Fousey is what his audience wants him to be, there is no real steadfast morality, and yet

15:45.480 --> 15:49.360
he chooses to insert it into his videos to give him that reputability.

15:49.360 --> 15:53.900
It is his quest to be the champion of the people, and yet his methods are so objectionable

15:53.900 --> 15:57.840
it makes it hard for all the charity to ever feel justified.

15:57.840 --> 16:01.320
And this was all exposed when he admitted the little of it was fake, he didn't have

16:01.320 --> 16:06.120
any more to give to the genre, he'd smashed and grabbed, and it had given him something,

16:06.120 --> 16:07.880
but he wasn't Drake's best mate.

16:07.880 --> 16:08.880
What a shame.

16:08.880 --> 16:12.180
The problem is that in spite of all the good things in the world you can do with that money

16:12.180 --> 16:16.440
you make, the conventions were never particularly fond of pranksters because either they legitimately

16:16.440 --> 16:19.680
created disorder within communities, or they falsely portrayed them.

16:19.680 --> 16:23.600
Fousey thought his ends could justify the means, and unfortunately when you're a company,

16:23.600 --> 16:26.840
a venue, anything at all, you have a reputation to uphold.

16:26.840 --> 16:29.160
Why would you want someone who may cause disruption?

16:29.160 --> 16:33.620
Fousey had a two-part plan, make himself famous, doing whatever he can, and then insert

16:33.620 --> 16:36.240
himself into the mainstream eye by being a lovely bloke.

16:36.240 --> 16:41.280
He didn't think there might be a qualification required of actually getting famous in a respectful

16:41.280 --> 16:45.120
manner, and unfortunately he's not that special, no matter how many motivational speeches

16:45.120 --> 16:49.040
he makes, and when the idea that you purposely gained weight just to lose it for the sole

16:49.040 --> 16:52.980
motivation of a video is considered a credible theory, then you might want to take a look

16:52.980 --> 16:56.400
at yourself in the mirror, after you've lost the weight of course.

16:56.400 --> 17:00.240
And it was likely when he hosted a venue himself where only a few hundred people turned up,

17:00.240 --> 17:04.780
that he realised that something wasn't quite right, and that he hadn't immortalised himself.

17:04.780 --> 17:08.120
Many of us want a legacy, many of us want to be remembered, especially on this YouTube

17:08.120 --> 17:12.400
platform, and I think Fousey has such grandiose visions of what he wants himself to be that

17:12.400 --> 17:15.080
he's just not satisfied with what he already has.

17:15.080 --> 17:16.080
Ironic.

17:16.080 --> 17:20.300
He wants something immaterial, something to be remembered by, and when 375 people turn

17:20.300 --> 17:23.520
up to your speech you realise you're being forgotten very quickly.

17:23.520 --> 17:26.800
Fousey wants to be this leading figure in whatever genre he chooses.

17:26.800 --> 17:30.600
The pranks gave him a significant amount of fame, but he didn't have the depth to carry

17:30.600 --> 17:32.220
that through as a legacy.

17:32.220 --> 17:36.240
So if you can't join them, then you just host FouseyCon.

17:45.440 --> 17:49.600
It's very easy to look at what's happening and see FouseyCon as the eventual capitulation

17:49.600 --> 17:51.160
of an internet persona.

17:51.160 --> 17:53.360
What did it really represent to Fousey?

17:53.360 --> 17:55.880
And above all, why did he choose to do it?

17:55.880 --> 17:59.420
Judging from everything that I gathered from his older content, it's like he's on a

17:59.420 --> 18:04.840
mission to create the ideal persona, the persona that is perfectly catered to gaining an internet

18:04.840 --> 18:05.840
legacy.

18:05.840 --> 18:09.840
However, the genres he chose in the past were not compatible with the type of effect that

18:09.840 --> 18:11.040
he was looking for.

18:11.040 --> 18:15.480
FouseyCon was just the point where everything broke, he got tired of trying to passively

18:15.480 --> 18:20.380
slide his way into the life of a celebrity, so he just decided to forcefully insert himself

18:20.380 --> 18:21.380
into it.

18:21.380 --> 18:26.140
Whether it was Drake, LeBron James, DJ Khaled, I could go on as a large subscriber base,

18:26.140 --> 18:27.140
10 million.

18:27.140 --> 18:29.060
But it wasn't giving him the status that he desired.

18:29.060 --> 18:34.420
The thing is, Fousey always crafted his image about being inspirational, about being grateful

18:34.420 --> 18:37.640
for what you have and preaching all these moral messages, but deep down there was a

18:37.640 --> 18:40.380
person incredibly dissatisfied with where they stood.

18:40.380 --> 18:43.780
He was almost looking for a way to make his own personality sustainable.

18:43.780 --> 18:47.540
He wanted to be invited to the parties, the conferences, the conventions, through the

18:47.540 --> 18:52.100
notion of just existing, and making the occasional inspirational speech.

18:52.100 --> 18:55.620
Unfortunately nothing he had ever done gave him that status, and he was still searching,

18:55.620 --> 18:59.840
yet he made the very strange decision to become more invested within the commentary side of

18:59.840 --> 19:05.140
YouTube, which really he should be doing the opposite, like all of the other ex-pranksters.

19:05.140 --> 19:07.340
Commentary couldn't be more against Fousey.

19:07.340 --> 19:10.800
Commentary is an absolute shitfest, make no mistake, but there is an extremely strong

19:10.800 --> 19:14.860
moral compass when it comes to conduct, and what he'd get away with to his prank audience,

19:14.860 --> 19:17.460
he'd be completely obliterated within commentary.

19:17.460 --> 19:21.500
Ideally he should be isolating himself from these people and running back to the community

19:21.500 --> 19:25.420
with the very unassuming fans, not the ones who are going to completely skewer him for

19:25.420 --> 19:26.500
every misstep.

19:26.500 --> 19:29.340
Why would he ever involve himself with such a group of people?

19:29.340 --> 19:33.020
Well from my observations it's because Fousey has a very strange approach to reasoning that

19:33.020 --> 19:34.120
makes his decisions.

19:34.120 --> 19:38.120
He has a habit of acting impulsively, completely on emotional response, and then attempting

19:38.120 --> 19:42.540
to create a logical argument surrounding it after he's already acted, even if that action

19:42.540 --> 19:46.460
was incredibly wrong, which can make for some very interesting scenarios.

19:46.460 --> 19:50.800
He threw himself into commentary because he saw the enticement of immediate attention,

19:50.800 --> 19:53.180
but never considered that that may flail long term.

19:53.180 --> 19:57.700
A famous example of his impulsive acts would be when he took down ColossalIsCrazy's video

19:57.700 --> 20:01.380
on him, clearly angry that Colossal sought to challenge the image that he wanted others

20:01.380 --> 20:02.380
to see.

20:02.380 --> 20:05.820
However, Fousey made up a ridiculous explanation of why he did it, firstly saying that it's

20:05.820 --> 20:10.060
incredulous that he should justify his actions, because the video was about him.

20:10.060 --> 20:15.060
I mean, yes, of course, bar all the fair use laws and obviously the fact that people always

20:15.060 --> 20:18.060
talk about other people is just a really stupid thing to say.

20:45.060 --> 20:56.700
And then saying that he took it down because Colossal used footage of his mum and dad and

20:56.700 --> 21:01.140
dubbed over it, saying that he doesn't have to justify it before attempting to justify

21:01.140 --> 21:04.900
it, while also ignoring the fact that he was more than happy to monetise and keep the video

21:04.900 --> 21:08.780
up, allowing all those people to see Colossal mocking his family just as long as Fousey

21:08.780 --> 21:10.060
was profiting off it.

21:10.060 --> 21:11.860
It was embarrassing.

21:11.860 --> 21:18.700
But the reason this video in particular caught my attention was because this video used footage

21:18.700 --> 21:24.220
from my mum and dad, so the fact that I even have to justify any actions that I took against

21:24.220 --> 21:27.940
the video that was made was just absolutely insane.

21:27.940 --> 21:32.220
Fousey acts first and justifies later, and all this was on show with his latest event,

21:32.220 --> 21:35.980
FouseyCon, an event which he arranged very quickly and boasts a load of huge names that

21:35.980 --> 21:38.580
subsequently were proven to have never headlined anyway.

21:38.580 --> 21:42.820
I have no doubt that Fousey planned to include Drake to have all these huge artists performing,

21:42.820 --> 21:44.900
because Fousey probably envisioned it that way.

21:44.900 --> 21:46.420
He set out a list of goals.

21:46.420 --> 21:52.500
Together, that night we are going to dispel hate and change the frequency of life to love.

21:52.500 --> 21:57.540
We are going to be, I'm declaring it right fucking now, YouTube's going to stream this

21:57.540 --> 22:02.380
event, it's going to be on the front page, it's going to have over 1 million concurrent

22:02.380 --> 22:07.140
viewers, TMZ's going to be in the audience, you're going to be in the audience, news channels

22:07.140 --> 22:14.660
are going to be in the audience, 5800 people sold out for free at the Greek theatre, okay?

22:14.660 --> 22:19.220
And right then and there, all of us celebrating together, we're sending a message to the world

22:19.220 --> 22:23.580
that from that day forward we're choosing love and we're going to kill this hate shit.

22:23.580 --> 22:27.800
However, when many of us set out our own goals, we always attempt to manage expectations.

22:27.800 --> 22:30.940
We wouldn't announce someone performing if they weren't confirmed.

22:30.940 --> 22:32.360
Fousey doesn't think that way.

22:32.360 --> 22:36.140
He thinks that with enough conviction, effort, and belief that it will just appear in your

22:36.140 --> 22:37.140
lap.

22:37.140 --> 22:38.140
So he promises it in advance.

22:38.140 --> 22:40.140
But the world doesn't work out that way.

22:40.140 --> 22:44.460
On top of that, Fousey often claims this principle that everything is part of a greater plan.

22:44.460 --> 22:48.420
For some, this famous philosophy may help people react to unfortunate situations in

22:48.420 --> 22:49.420
a collective fashion.

22:49.420 --> 22:53.780
However, for Fousey, this allows him to devolve responsibility when things go wrong.

22:53.780 --> 22:55.420
He can say and act how he wants.

22:55.420 --> 22:58.060
If it doesn't happen, there must be a greater intervention.

22:58.060 --> 23:02.780
Example, if Drake turns up, people will view him as a prophet and he pulled it off.

23:02.780 --> 23:06.100
And if Drake doesn't, it just wasn't meant to be.

23:06.100 --> 23:07.100
That's God's plan.

23:07.100 --> 23:11.620
There are plenty of people who think his explanations are perfectly reasonable, perfectly sensible,

23:11.620 --> 23:15.280
partly because of the way he carries himself, the sort of positive, look what I can do kind

23:15.280 --> 23:18.740
of guy, where he talks about how he's going to make it through, in spite of all these

23:18.740 --> 23:19.740
setbacks.

23:19.740 --> 23:23.100
I always received the impression he's doing it to help his self-image, rather than help

23:23.100 --> 23:24.100
those around him.

23:24.100 --> 23:28.280
And that's the thing, in commentary, we don't give you a pass for just saying nice things.

23:28.280 --> 23:31.740
Speaking morally doesn't somehow absolve your wrongful actions.

23:31.740 --> 23:35.460
Another notable trait that came out of FouseyCon was how he responded to criticism.

23:35.460 --> 23:39.500
Politically, all over the world recently, we've witnessed the rise of populist figures,

23:39.500 --> 23:43.620
many of whom cherish the sort of mainstream establishment narrative that other publications

23:43.620 --> 23:45.460
and media propagate against them.

23:45.460 --> 23:49.620
Generally, what this point adopts is, these people have an ulterior agenda to stop me,

23:49.620 --> 23:52.860
therefore they will purposely misframe everything to cater to that.

23:52.860 --> 23:57.140
When people were challenging Fousey's testimony of how the situation unfolded, particularly

23:57.140 --> 24:01.900
figures like PewDiePie and DeFranco and Keemstar, he responded using this argument, you're

24:01.900 --> 24:04.220
seeing it from your own biased perspective.

24:04.220 --> 24:07.500
He was turning to them and saying, you have an agenda against me, so of course you're

24:07.500 --> 24:09.700
not going to say anything nice about my event.

24:09.700 --> 24:13.460
Now in some instances, the idea that someone might have an agenda to misrepresent your

24:13.460 --> 24:18.420
situation can be a fairly legitimate argument, but given the amount of footage of the situation,

24:18.420 --> 24:22.060
the idea that what occurred is taken out of context is highly unlikely.

24:22.060 --> 24:26.180
Sure, people will have biased opinions on previous experiences, but that's the nature

24:26.180 --> 24:30.440
of discourse, as long as the facts are clear then there's not much you can complain about.

24:30.440 --> 24:33.740
This identifies another problem that I regularly observe about Fousey.

24:33.780 --> 24:38.540
He has a habit of applying arguments that may be valid in certain circumstances to irrelevant

24:38.540 --> 24:39.540
situations.

24:39.540 --> 24:42.940
In the colossal situation, you could make the argument that what he did was disrespectful

24:42.940 --> 24:46.460
to his family, you could argue that it was tactless, but then to go on and say that it

24:46.460 --> 24:49.280
justified a takedown is completely illogical.

24:49.280 --> 24:52.860
People may have an agenda against you, that doesn't mean that every time they say you

24:52.860 --> 24:55.500
fucked up means that you haven't fucked up.

24:55.500 --> 24:59.460
Other times his arguments may qualify as valid, but they're just a masquerade for the real

24:59.460 --> 25:00.460
reason.

25:00.460 --> 25:06.700
He then writes a tweet explaining that he did this because he felt that people were

25:06.700 --> 25:12.420
too prone to following the crowd, and by disabling everything it gave people the full, unbiased

25:12.420 --> 25:13.820
experience.

25:13.820 --> 25:17.380
Wow, what a profit.

25:17.380 --> 25:21.780
This fact may be true, but it also exposes inconsistencies that say a lot about Fousey's

25:21.780 --> 25:22.780
principles.

25:22.780 --> 25:26.780
Firstly, it's interesting considering he never disabled ratings on his old videos that

25:26.780 --> 25:30.280
were well received by a majority of people, meaning that he only started caring about

25:30.280 --> 25:34.360
influential opinions when they were against him, and secondly, we're not actually receiving

25:34.360 --> 25:37.860
an unbiased look at the situation, we're receiving Fousey's look at it.

25:37.860 --> 25:42.380
Thirdly, it's funny how once again he sought to explain this a while after actually doing

25:42.380 --> 25:43.380
it.

25:43.380 --> 25:45.940
As I said, act first, explain later.

25:45.940 --> 25:50.100
And then he uses this argument that the event was free, so he's such a charitable man,

25:50.100 --> 25:53.340
and it may have been free, but it's not free to travel there, people have shelled out money

25:53.340 --> 25:55.980
to see Fousey who's made promises and let people down.

25:55.980 --> 26:00.380
He should apologise, and stop spewing out rhetoric which represents a failed visionary

26:00.380 --> 26:02.480
who has dreamed more than he lived.

26:02.480 --> 26:05.540
And sure, some people may have been inspired by his speech, but there are more efficient

26:05.540 --> 26:08.840
ways to change people's lives than calling some of these people across the country for

26:08.840 --> 26:11.260
a convention that wasn't really as promised.

26:11.260 --> 26:15.740
But okay, according to The Blast, Drake never met the YouTuber, he was never booked for

26:15.740 --> 26:18.620
Fousey's show, and he's never even heard of him.

26:18.620 --> 26:22.060
Fousey has always had this dream of how he wants to be viewed, and how he wants people

26:22.060 --> 26:23.060
to look at him.

26:23.060 --> 26:27.300
He used to be this philosophical socialite, inspiring people to go out and act as he would,

26:27.300 --> 26:31.400
but I believe the desperation to make it there firstly led him to highly questionable measures

26:31.400 --> 26:35.980
with his prank videos, and eventually took him here, to a state which isn't good, isn't

26:35.980 --> 26:39.300
healthy, and is just kinda destructive to certain people's lives.

26:39.300 --> 26:43.940
Fousey has created such a reputation for himself that the only way to redeem it is to start

26:43.940 --> 26:48.760
afresh, and even then, he'll have continuous mishaps hanging over him, he's had the time

26:48.760 --> 26:51.700
to rectify his errors, and he hasn't taken it.

26:51.700 --> 26:56.120
There are only so many chances you get, he had to do something new, and he had to make

26:56.120 --> 27:00.300
it happen, and no amount of post hoc justification can change what happened.

27:00.300 --> 27:03.980
Some people have made this out to be a sudden turn of him, but I believe it's all completely

27:03.980 --> 27:05.380
in line with his character.

27:05.380 --> 27:08.520
The same traits are there, they've just been taken to new levels, in an attempt to

27:08.520 --> 27:10.440
gain some form of traction.

27:10.440 --> 27:14.240
If it worked, sure, it would have been fantastic, but there was an overwhelming probability

27:14.240 --> 27:17.820
that it wouldn't, however sometimes when you're caught up in your own plans, you

27:17.820 --> 27:18.820
don't see that.

27:19.140 --> 27:23.700
Though I look forward to the countless explanations to come, for exactly why all of us are wrong,

27:23.700 --> 27:28.820
and somehow a higher force has led us to be, and this is our destiny.

27:28.820 --> 27:30.500
Makes perfect sense to me.

27:30.500 --> 27:35.300
Anyhow, those were my thoughts on Fouseytube, and his recent turn.

27:35.300 --> 27:39.220
I would love to hear your thoughts too in the comments below, I love a good open discussion,

27:39.220 --> 27:43.540
I normally reply to comments in the first few hours and then I leave it for a bit.

However you can always reach me on my Twitter, at TheRightOpinion, or you can reach me on

27:47.820 --> 27:51.860

28:14.820 --> 28:15.820
me.

28:15.820 --> 28:20.900

28:30.580 --> 28:31.580
how it is.

28:31.580 --> 28:36.260
