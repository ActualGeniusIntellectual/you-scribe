0	2000	Here's one I've wanted to get to.
7000	11000	Hello ladies and gentlemen and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time,
11000	14000	and the justice system, something that's covered a fair bit on this channel.
14000	19000	And to be honest, I think it should be. A lot of the problems that we face do come down to the systems that hold it in place,
19000	21000	whether it be jurisdictions, governmental, or just societal.
21000	25000	Today we're going to be looking at one of the more illogical moments of recent in the justice system,
25000	28000	the treatment of quote-unquote, talented individuals.
28000	34000	Her potential was caught about a week ago when I saw an angry tweet about females who had been let off their sentencing due to talent and career prospects.
34000	39000	The most recent incident being one with a model who was caught shoplifting nearly a thousand pounds worth of items from Harrods.
39000	43000	Now her penalty was a small fine, completely within the legal threshold for such a crime.
43000	46000	However, what bemused a lot of people was the reasoning.
46000	52000	The judge listed the fact that she pleaded guilty at the first opportunity and the potential for a bright future as reasons why he was going to let her off.
52000	54000	This understandably annoyed a lot of people.
54000	56000	Let's have a look at his statement piece by piece.
56000	59000	This man is called magistrate Grant McCroskey.
59000	64000	You are a newcomer to this country. You are a student with a place at university.
64000	70000	So I'm going to ignore that typo at first and just assume it's country, not county, because the laws aren't different in fucking different counties.
70000	75000	But either way, I assume that Poland, which is the country that this model, namely Natalia Sakarowska, comes from,
75000	78000	has laws against shoplifting too, just has doing a guess.
78000	81000	And now to the student with a place at university.
81000	83000	That's a very astute observation, Grant. Well done.
83000	85000	But a lot of people are students at university.
85000	90000	And I'm sure a lot of criminals and probably a lot of people who are facing court down too are students at university as well.
90000	91000	Doesn't really change much.
91000	92000	Let's continue.
92000	95000	Taking goods from any store, including Harrods, is wrong.
95000	99000	Well said, Grant. You're really on a hot street today, Grant, mate.
99000	103000	You're a magistrate, not a personal service announcement for fucking toddlers.
103000	107000	He's not wrong, but I'm just saying it's pretty obvious he doesn't need to explain that.
107000	108000	We'll carry on.
108000	111000	Your future has been put at risk by these actions.
111000	112000	That is also true.
112000	114000	Now, this is the statement that caught most people's eye.
114000	119000	Because of the fact that you pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity, and you do have the potential for a bright future,
119000	122000	we will deal with this more leniently than we should have.
122000	126000	Now, sometimes I'm more understanding of an early plea centre's reduction,
126000	129000	often if it saves time or emotional stress during a trial,
129000	131000	but I doubt it would have made much difference in this instance.
131000	135000	My guess is that she probably just pled guilty because she would have been found guilty anyway,
135000	137000	though that's just conjecture.
137000	139000	However, it was the latter that caught most people's outrage,
139000	143000	stating that she might have had a bright future, so he was going to let her rot.
143000	145000	And to be honest, I understand the outrage.
145000	147000	The whole dialogue seems very awkward to say the least,
147000	150000	and it does seem like the judge is clutching at straws for his reasoning.
150000	153000	Normally, the severity of the sentence would be based on the crime itself,
153000	158000	and the mentality behind the crime, not circumstances surrounding their external personal life.
158000	162000	And given the fact that a lot of people wouldn't receive this privilege, it's understandably irritating.
162000	164000	This isn't even the first time this has happened.
164000	167000	Another more serious occurrence happened earlier this year,
167000	170000	in which Oxford student and aspiring surgeon, Lavinia Woodward,
170000	175000	who stabbed her boyfriend, was spared jail because the judge didn't want to jeopardise her future.
175000	179000	Now, it seems that I'm not the only person who wouldn't want her operating on my heart.
179000	182000	And once again, people weren't too pleased with the fact that she was let off.
182000	186000	And obviously the thing that both these cases have in common is that they're attractive young ladies.
186000	190000	I think people are well aware that there is a societal prejudice that attractive people tend to do better,
190000	193000	and that's unfortunately impossible to erase.
193000	198000	People do hope that that doesn't seep into delivering proper verdicts when these people commit wrongdoings.
198000	201000	Is it understandable to be annoyed about it? Yes.
201000	202000	Is there much that can be done about it?
202000	207000	Well, unless you tighten the guidelines, it's hard because they're just exercising their legislative power.
207000	211000	The only way it can be done is if you opened an inquiry or study into crimes in their respective sentences.
211000	215000	Because at the end of the day, a few rogue situations could just be anomalies.
215000	219000	People know that jurors are prone to bias, but magistrates and other lawmakers are thought a lot more highly.
219000	223000	And to be honest, they should be held accountable, but as long as they're acting within their rights,
223000	227000	it's hard because you can't judge their motivations unless they explicitly state it.
227000	230000	But maybe it's time to make sure that such reasoning isn't applied again,
230000	235000	because the statements made do show a questionable application of logic in the legal system.
235000	240000	A punitive measure should relate to the crime and conditions related to the crime, such as a person's general mental state.
240000	245000	I could understand that, for example, but someone's possible bright future, it shouldn't let them off anything.
245000	247000	They should face judgement like anyone else would.
247000	249000	I'm The Right Opinion, and I'll see you in the next one.
