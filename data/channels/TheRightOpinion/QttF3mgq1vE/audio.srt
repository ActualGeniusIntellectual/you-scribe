00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Here's one I've wanted to get to.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Hello ladies and gentlemen and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time,

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and the justice system, something that's covered a fair bit on this channel.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
And to be honest, I think it should be. A lot of the problems that we face do come down to the systems that hold it in place,

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
whether it be jurisdictions, governmental, or just societal.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Today we're going to be looking at one of the more illogical moments of recent in the justice system,

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
the treatment of quote-unquote, talented individuals.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Her potential was caught about a week ago when I saw an angry tweet about females who had been let off their sentencing due to talent and career prospects.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The most recent incident being one with a model who was caught shoplifting nearly a thousand pounds worth of items from Harrods.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Now her penalty was a small fine, completely within the legal threshold for such a crime.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
However, what bemused a lot of people was the reasoning.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The judge listed the fact that she pleaded guilty at the first opportunity and the potential for a bright future as reasons why he was going to let her off.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
This understandably annoyed a lot of people.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Let's have a look at his statement piece by piece.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
This man is called magistrate Grant McCroskey.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
You are a newcomer to this country. You are a student with a place at university.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
So I'm going to ignore that typo at first and just assume it's country, not county, because the laws aren't different in fucking different counties.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
But either way, I assume that Poland, which is the country that this model, namely Natalia Sakarowska, comes from,

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
has laws against shoplifting too, just has doing a guess.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
And now to the student with a place at university.

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
That's a very astute observation, Grant. Well done.

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
But a lot of people are students at university.

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And I'm sure a lot of criminals and probably a lot of people who are facing court down too are students at university as well.

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Doesn't really change much.

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Let's continue.

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Taking goods from any store, including Harrods, is wrong.

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Well said, Grant. You're really on a hot street today, Grant, mate.

28
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
You're a magistrate, not a personal service announcement for fucking toddlers.

29
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
He's not wrong, but I'm just saying it's pretty obvious he doesn't need to explain that.

30
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
We'll carry on.

31
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Your future has been put at risk by these actions.

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
That is also true.

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Now, this is the statement that caught most people's eye.

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Because of the fact that you pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity, and you do have the potential for a bright future,

35
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
we will deal with this more leniently than we should have.

36
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Now, sometimes I'm more understanding of an early plea centre's reduction,

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
often if it saves time or emotional stress during a trial,

38
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
but I doubt it would have made much difference in this instance.

39
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
My guess is that she probably just pled guilty because she would have been found guilty anyway,

40
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
though that's just conjecture.

41
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
However, it was the latter that caught most people's outrage,

42
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
stating that she might have had a bright future, so he was going to let her rot.

43
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
And to be honest, I understand the outrage.

44
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
The whole dialogue seems very awkward to say the least,

45
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
and it does seem like the judge is clutching at straws for his reasoning.

46
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Normally, the severity of the sentence would be based on the crime itself,

47
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
and the mentality behind the crime, not circumstances surrounding their external personal life.

48
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
And given the fact that a lot of people wouldn't receive this privilege, it's understandably irritating.

49
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
This isn't even the first time this has happened.

50
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Another more serious occurrence happened earlier this year,

51
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
in which Oxford student and aspiring surgeon, Lavinia Woodward,

52
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
who stabbed her boyfriend, was spared jail because the judge didn't want to jeopardise her future.

53
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Now, it seems that I'm not the only person who wouldn't want her operating on my heart.

54
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
And once again, people weren't too pleased with the fact that she was let off.

55
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
And obviously the thing that both these cases have in common is that they're attractive young ladies.

56
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I think people are well aware that there is a societal prejudice that attractive people tend to do better,

57
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
and that's unfortunately impossible to erase.

58
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
People do hope that that doesn't seep into delivering proper verdicts when these people commit wrongdoings.

59
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Is it understandable to be annoyed about it? Yes.

60
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Is there much that can be done about it?

61
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Well, unless you tighten the guidelines, it's hard because they're just exercising their legislative power.

62
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
The only way it can be done is if you opened an inquiry or study into crimes in their respective sentences.

63
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Because at the end of the day, a few rogue situations could just be anomalies.

64
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
People know that jurors are prone to bias, but magistrates and other lawmakers are thought a lot more highly.

65
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
And to be honest, they should be held accountable, but as long as they're acting within their rights,

66
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
it's hard because you can't judge their motivations unless they explicitly state it.

67
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
But maybe it's time to make sure that such reasoning isn't applied again,

68
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
because the statements made do show a questionable application of logic in the legal system.

69
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
A punitive measure should relate to the crime and conditions related to the crime, such as a person's general mental state.

70
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I could understand that, for example, but someone's possible bright future, it shouldn't let them off anything.

71
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
They should face judgement like anyone else would.

72
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I'm The Right Opinion, and I'll see you in the next one.
