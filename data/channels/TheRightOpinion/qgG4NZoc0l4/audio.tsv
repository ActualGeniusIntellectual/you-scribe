0	7600	a man of many talents. Hello ladies and gentlemen, welcome to The Right Opinion,
7600	11680	the home of a twat with too much free time, and today we talk about Kendrick Lamar. I know,
11680	15120	music. For anyone who's been around long enough on this channel, they will be aware that I have
15120	19600	a deep love for music. I have a massive catalogue of tunes, and I pretty much listen to every song
19600	23520	on New Music Friday. I have an extremely deep interest for it. However, that may be news to
23520	27680	anyone who is relatively recent to my channel, and I have a little PSA for you. Expect a few
27680	32160	videos about music interspersed, because there are few things that I'm more passionate for than
32160	36560	my music ventures. So as you may have guessed by the title, this video is about Kendrick. Now,
36560	40160	as an avid listener of music, you'll be unsurprised to know that I did listen to Damn,
40160	43760	and was thoroughly impressed by his dexterous lyricism and narrative as always. Personal
43760	47600	favourite song is Duckworth, and that's because I enjoy a good story and I love the intermixed funk
47600	52240	samples. Though obviously there are a number of good songs that deserve recognition, I'm not going
52240	56320	to run through the honourable mentions though right now. However, Kendrick's songs also gain
56320	60400	a lot of reputation for being quite political, the sort of social commentary that is quite hard
60400	64800	to come by in a lot of modern rap music. And to be honest, you don't always expect it, some songs are
64800	73680	just stupid party jams, but it's always refreshing when one does come along. Now, I have to admit,
73680	77120	due to my fairly frantic upload schedule, I haven't had the chance to listen to the political
77120	82160	subtext of his latest album, so I've found someone who has, and that is Vanilla Rice. And Vanilla
82160	86640	Rice is going to explain in depth a lot of the undertones in his latest album. Take it away,
86640	90080	my friends. Hello, so I've been asked to do a little piece on Kendrick Lamar. See,
90080	94320	he released his new album, and it's pretty good. I really thoroughly enjoyed it. I've listened to
94320	98800	it countless times, but however he's fallen under some criticism, especially from people on the
98800	104480	right, people on the right that liked Kendrick's music. It's no wonder the KKK died out. All the
104480	110800	white racists just sat back and laughed as they watched hip-hop music decimate black music.
110800	115600	Kendrick Lamar, he released his album, and he states a lot of things in it.
119440	124400	Fox News, he quotes their little thing, their little piece they did on him,
124400	128560	where they state basically... Police brutality with that line in the song,
128560	134960	quote, and we hate the po-po, want to kill us in the street, fo-show. KG. Oh, please.
134960	137600	What? Ugh, I don't like it.
137600	143280	Yeah, thinking that the message behind that song is, you know, we hate the police,
143280	147600	they all want to kill us, and we want to kill them, fight the corrupt government,
148240	152800	when if you actually listen to the song, that's not what it's about. Kendrick Lamar stated these
152800	157680	are some answers to, you know, questions he's been given, questions he's wanting to ask people.
157680	163680	That's why the song names are, you know, like, labeled, like, love, lost human emotions,
163680	170000	and these are how, this is how Kendrick Lamar feels on those subjects. Now, Kendrick Lamar,
170000	175600	on Triple X, which is, I love this song, it's brilliant, he's presented with a question,
177280	183360	one of his home dogs, one of his homies, in the hood. Unfortunately, his fictional son is killed,
183360	188880	and they go and ask Kendrick, what do I do? And then Kendrick, you know, he's got a loose filter
188880	199520	on him, and he says, you know, so now you know that this album, this is just how Kendrick feels.
199520	204320	And of course, the right flake give Kendrick a flag, because he states how he feels about
204320	210560	Donald Trump. Now, I think, as previously mentioned, you can't really expect Kendrick Lamar
210560	215680	to love Donald Trump. It's like Paul Joseph Watson, oh, Kendrick Lamar, he doesn't like
215680	223120	Donald Trump, oh, he's just anti for left, he's anti for left, oh, he's a leftist liberal libtard.
223120	227040	But then you remember that, of course, he's gonna see Donald Trump in that light, because
227040	235440	he's grown up in the inner cities, and he's had a very tough life. Again, if you like Donald Trump,
236080	243200	and you can't listen to Kendrick Lamar because he doesn't like Donald Trump, then, yeah, just
243920	253760	end yourself, I don't know, stab yourself with a, with a, with a dreadlock, I don't know. Anyway,
253760	259920	that's been my thing, thank you for having me on this video, I hope I added something,
259920	269280	can't even remember what I said. Anyway, look at that, it's ended, he punches the camera.
269280	272880	Thank you Vanilla Rice for helping me out with that one, very much appreciated. His
272880	276320	channel will be linked in the description below. Now with politics comes critics,
276320	280640	as shown by one of the audio clips right at the start in Blood. Fox News reacted rather badly to
280640	284880	the song Alright, and in one of his preview songs for the album The Heart Part 4, he was also
284880	289520	denounced by many right-wing commentators for labelling Donald Trump a chump, with many believing
289520	293680	he was just another establishment mouthpiece. Rap music seems particularly hostile to those of the
293680	298160	Trump persuasion, with Eminem and Snoop Dogg also taking shots in the last few months or so,
298160	302400	some more verbal, others more physical. And to respond to that, what I would say is,
302400	306480	why wouldn't it be hostile? Rap music culture is generally built around the struggles of inner
306480	310800	city working class people, some of those least likely to vote for someone like Trump. I have
310800	314240	regularly attacked critics of Trump for being out as touch socialites, but it doesn't mean everyone
314240	318560	who attacks Trump is that. It's not like Kendrick is absolving the communities that he represents
318560	322320	of any criticism, in fact in the song The Black and the Berry, my favourite song of his, his
322320	326640	narrative shifts to expose the hypocrisy of many of the communities that he is actually from. That
326640	330240	doesn't make him an extremist Trump supporter though, but yet we always seem to work with
330240	334640	extremes. Most people seem to think you're either communist or fascist, when the truth is,
334640	339120	you can exist without being either. Now I'm aware that Kendrick's comments of Trump being a chump
339120	343040	aren't particularly constructive or useful, but nonetheless he's allowed to vent, people aren't
343040	347120	entitled to an explanation, and he didn't preach it like he was trying to convert anyone. It
347120	351280	doesn't annoy me at all, probably because I believe the insults come from a genuine place,
351280	356880	and it wasn't so arrogant. If you want things that do piss me off, it's complacency and this
356880	361600	false feeling of righteousness. A really good example of this was Josh Whedon's tweets mocking
361600	366320	Paul Ryan upon his meeting of teenage cancer survivors. In contrast, Kendrick's music never
366320	369840	has that feeling of righteousness, he runs a narrative and allows you to draw your own
369840	374000	conclusion. Although the narrative may present its own opinions, it's always an open-ended matter,
374000	378640	which is why his criticism always comes across as a lot less hostile, and also you get the feeling
378640	382560	that he speaks from experience, and speaks from the heart, which makes a lot of his narrative a
382560	386560	lot more reasonable. I don't believe rap music belongs to the political elite, it's a very
386560	390000	strong weapon against political correctness, you could just look at Eminem for that, and it's also
390000	394000	a way of giving the voiceless a voice, despite its misuse sometimes, which I acknowledge.
394000	397920	Kendrick Lamar is many things, but I don't think his take on politics is one that negatively
397920	401840	affects the current state of affairs. He's not a social justice warrior or Hollywood elitist,
401840	404800	he's someone who's gone through genuine struggle, and that reflects in his music,
404800	408240	and his music isn't entirely political, but it's dynamically in touch with the
408240	413040	issues that many people face, and that's what matters to me. I'm the right opinion, and damn.
