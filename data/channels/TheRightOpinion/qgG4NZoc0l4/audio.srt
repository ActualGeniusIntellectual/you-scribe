00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,600
a man of many talents. Hello ladies and gentlemen, welcome to The Right Opinion,

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:11,680
the home of a twat with too much free time, and today we talk about Kendrick Lamar. I know,

3
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:15,120
music. For anyone who's been around long enough on this channel, they will be aware that I have

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,600
a deep love for music. I have a massive catalogue of tunes, and I pretty much listen to every song

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,520
on New Music Friday. I have an extremely deep interest for it. However, that may be news to

6
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:27,680
anyone who is relatively recent to my channel, and I have a little PSA for you. Expect a few

7
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:32,160
videos about music interspersed, because there are few things that I'm more passionate for than

8
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,560
my music ventures. So as you may have guessed by the title, this video is about Kendrick. Now,

9
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:40,160
as an avid listener of music, you'll be unsurprised to know that I did listen to Damn,

10
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,760
and was thoroughly impressed by his dexterous lyricism and narrative as always. Personal

11
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,600
favourite song is Duckworth, and that's because I enjoy a good story and I love the intermixed funk

12
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,240
samples. Though obviously there are a number of good songs that deserve recognition, I'm not going

13
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:56,320
to run through the honourable mentions though right now. However, Kendrick's songs also gain

14
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,400
a lot of reputation for being quite political, the sort of social commentary that is quite hard

15
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:04,800
to come by in a lot of modern rap music. And to be honest, you don't always expect it, some songs are

16
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:13,680
just stupid party jams, but it's always refreshing when one does come along. Now, I have to admit,

17
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,120
due to my fairly frantic upload schedule, I haven't had the chance to listen to the political

18
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:22,160
subtext of his latest album, so I've found someone who has, and that is Vanilla Rice. And Vanilla

19
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:26,640
Rice is going to explain in depth a lot of the undertones in his latest album. Take it away,

20
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,080
my friends. Hello, so I've been asked to do a little piece on Kendrick Lamar. See,

21
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:34,320
he released his new album, and it's pretty good. I really thoroughly enjoyed it. I've listened to

22
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,800
it countless times, but however he's fallen under some criticism, especially from people on the

23
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:44,480
right, people on the right that liked Kendrick's music. It's no wonder the KKK died out. All the

24
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:50,800
white racists just sat back and laughed as they watched hip-hop music decimate black music.

25
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:55,600
Kendrick Lamar, he released his album, and he states a lot of things in it.

26
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:04,400
Fox News, he quotes their little thing, their little piece they did on him,

27
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:08,560
where they state basically... Police brutality with that line in the song,

28
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:14,960
quote, and we hate the po-po, want to kill us in the street, fo-show. KG. Oh, please.

29
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,600
What? Ugh, I don't like it.

30
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:23,280
Yeah, thinking that the message behind that song is, you know, we hate the police,

31
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,600
they all want to kill us, and we want to kill them, fight the corrupt government,

32
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:32,800
when if you actually listen to the song, that's not what it's about. Kendrick Lamar stated these

33
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,680
are some answers to, you know, questions he's been given, questions he's wanting to ask people.

34
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:43,680
That's why the song names are, you know, like, labeled, like, love, lost human emotions,

35
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:50,000
and these are how, this is how Kendrick Lamar feels on those subjects. Now, Kendrick Lamar,

36
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,600
on Triple X, which is, I love this song, it's brilliant, he's presented with a question,

37
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:03,360
one of his home dogs, one of his homies, in the hood. Unfortunately, his fictional son is killed,

38
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:08,880
and they go and ask Kendrick, what do I do? And then Kendrick, you know, he's got a loose filter

39
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:19,520
on him, and he says, you know, so now you know that this album, this is just how Kendrick feels.

40
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:24,320
And of course, the right flake give Kendrick a flag, because he states how he feels about

41
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:30,560
Donald Trump. Now, I think, as previously mentioned, you can't really expect Kendrick Lamar

42
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,680
to love Donald Trump. It's like Paul Joseph Watson, oh, Kendrick Lamar, he doesn't like

43
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:43,120
Donald Trump, oh, he's just anti for left, he's anti for left, oh, he's a leftist liberal libtard.

44
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,040
But then you remember that, of course, he's gonna see Donald Trump in that light, because

45
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:55,440
he's grown up in the inner cities, and he's had a very tough life. Again, if you like Donald Trump,

46
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:03,200
and you can't listen to Kendrick Lamar because he doesn't like Donald Trump, then, yeah, just

47
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:13,760
end yourself, I don't know, stab yourself with a, with a, with a dreadlock, I don't know. Anyway,

48
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:19,920
that's been my thing, thank you for having me on this video, I hope I added something,

49
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:29,280
can't even remember what I said. Anyway, look at that, it's ended, he punches the camera.

50
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,880
Thank you Vanilla Rice for helping me out with that one, very much appreciated. His

51
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,320
channel will be linked in the description below. Now with politics comes critics,

52
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,640
as shown by one of the audio clips right at the start in Blood. Fox News reacted rather badly to

53
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:44,880
the song Alright, and in one of his preview songs for the album The Heart Part 4, he was also

54
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,520
denounced by many right-wing commentators for labelling Donald Trump a chump, with many believing

55
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,680
he was just another establishment mouthpiece. Rap music seems particularly hostile to those of the

56
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,160
Trump persuasion, with Eminem and Snoop Dogg also taking shots in the last few months or so,

57
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,400
some more verbal, others more physical. And to respond to that, what I would say is,

58
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,480
why wouldn't it be hostile? Rap music culture is generally built around the struggles of inner

59
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:10,800
city working class people, some of those least likely to vote for someone like Trump. I have

60
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,240
regularly attacked critics of Trump for being out as touch socialites, but it doesn't mean everyone

61
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,560
who attacks Trump is that. It's not like Kendrick is absolving the communities that he represents

62
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,320
of any criticism, in fact in the song The Black and the Berry, my favourite song of his, his

63
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,640
narrative shifts to expose the hypocrisy of many of the communities that he is actually from. That

64
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:30,240
doesn't make him an extremist Trump supporter though, but yet we always seem to work with

65
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,640
extremes. Most people seem to think you're either communist or fascist, when the truth is,

66
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:39,120
you can exist without being either. Now I'm aware that Kendrick's comments of Trump being a chump

67
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,040
aren't particularly constructive or useful, but nonetheless he's allowed to vent, people aren't

68
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:47,120
entitled to an explanation, and he didn't preach it like he was trying to convert anyone. It

69
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,280
doesn't annoy me at all, probably because I believe the insults come from a genuine place,

70
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:56,880
and it wasn't so arrogant. If you want things that do piss me off, it's complacency and this

71
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,600
false feeling of righteousness. A really good example of this was Josh Whedon's tweets mocking

72
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,320
Paul Ryan upon his meeting of teenage cancer survivors. In contrast, Kendrick's music never

73
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,840
has that feeling of righteousness, he runs a narrative and allows you to draw your own

74
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:14,000
conclusion. Although the narrative may present its own opinions, it's always an open-ended matter,

75
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,640
which is why his criticism always comes across as a lot less hostile, and also you get the feeling

76
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:22,560
that he speaks from experience, and speaks from the heart, which makes a lot of his narrative a

77
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,560
lot more reasonable. I don't believe rap music belongs to the political elite, it's a very

78
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,000
strong weapon against political correctness, you could just look at Eminem for that, and it's also

79
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
a way of giving the voiceless a voice, despite its misuse sometimes, which I acknowledge.

80
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,920
Kendrick Lamar is many things, but I don't think his take on politics is one that negatively

81
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:41,840
affects the current state of affairs. He's not a social justice warrior or Hollywood elitist,

82
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,800
he's someone who's gone through genuine struggle, and that reflects in his music,

83
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,240
and his music isn't entirely political, but it's dynamically in touch with the

84
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:53,040
issues that many people face, and that's what matters to me. I'm the right opinion, and damn.
