00:00.000 --> 00:07.600
a man of many talents. Hello ladies and gentlemen, welcome to The Right Opinion,

00:07.600 --> 00:11.680
the home of a twat with too much free time, and today we talk about Kendrick Lamar. I know,

00:11.680 --> 00:15.120
music. For anyone who's been around long enough on this channel, they will be aware that I have

00:15.120 --> 00:19.600
a deep love for music. I have a massive catalogue of tunes, and I pretty much listen to every song

00:19.600 --> 00:23.520
on New Music Friday. I have an extremely deep interest for it. However, that may be news to

00:23.520 --> 00:27.680
anyone who is relatively recent to my channel, and I have a little PSA for you. Expect a few

00:27.680 --> 00:32.160
videos about music interspersed, because there are few things that I'm more passionate for than

00:32.160 --> 00:36.560
my music ventures. So as you may have guessed by the title, this video is about Kendrick. Now,

00:36.560 --> 00:40.160
as an avid listener of music, you'll be unsurprised to know that I did listen to Damn,

00:40.160 --> 00:43.760
and was thoroughly impressed by his dexterous lyricism and narrative as always. Personal

00:43.760 --> 00:47.600
favourite song is Duckworth, and that's because I enjoy a good story and I love the intermixed funk

00:47.600 --> 00:52.240
samples. Though obviously there are a number of good songs that deserve recognition, I'm not going

00:52.240 --> 00:56.320
to run through the honourable mentions though right now. However, Kendrick's songs also gain

00:56.320 --> 01:00.400
a lot of reputation for being quite political, the sort of social commentary that is quite hard

01:00.400 --> 01:04.800
to come by in a lot of modern rap music. And to be honest, you don't always expect it, some songs are

01:04.800 --> 01:13.680
just stupid party jams, but it's always refreshing when one does come along. Now, I have to admit,

01:13.680 --> 01:17.120
due to my fairly frantic upload schedule, I haven't had the chance to listen to the political

01:17.120 --> 01:22.160
subtext of his latest album, so I've found someone who has, and that is Vanilla Rice. And Vanilla

01:22.160 --> 01:26.640
Rice is going to explain in depth a lot of the undertones in his latest album. Take it away,

01:26.640 --> 01:30.080
my friends. Hello, so I've been asked to do a little piece on Kendrick Lamar. See,

01:30.080 --> 01:34.320
he released his new album, and it's pretty good. I really thoroughly enjoyed it. I've listened to

01:34.320 --> 01:38.800
it countless times, but however he's fallen under some criticism, especially from people on the

01:38.800 --> 01:44.480
right, people on the right that liked Kendrick's music. It's no wonder the KKK died out. All the

01:44.480 --> 01:50.800
white racists just sat back and laughed as they watched hip-hop music decimate black music.

01:50.800 --> 01:55.600
Kendrick Lamar, he released his album, and he states a lot of things in it.

01:59.440 --> 02:04.400
Fox News, he quotes their little thing, their little piece they did on him,

02:04.400 --> 02:08.560
where they state basically... Police brutality with that line in the song,

02:08.560 --> 02:14.960
quote, and we hate the po-po, want to kill us in the street, fo-show. KG. Oh, please.

02:14.960 --> 02:17.600
What? Ugh, I don't like it.

02:17.600 --> 02:23.280
Yeah, thinking that the message behind that song is, you know, we hate the police,

02:23.280 --> 02:27.600
they all want to kill us, and we want to kill them, fight the corrupt government,

02:28.240 --> 02:32.800
when if you actually listen to the song, that's not what it's about. Kendrick Lamar stated these

02:32.800 --> 02:37.680
are some answers to, you know, questions he's been given, questions he's wanting to ask people.

02:37.680 --> 02:43.680
That's why the song names are, you know, like, labeled, like, love, lost human emotions,

02:43.680 --> 02:50.000
and these are how, this is how Kendrick Lamar feels on those subjects. Now, Kendrick Lamar,

02:50.000 --> 02:55.600
on Triple X, which is, I love this song, it's brilliant, he's presented with a question,

02:57.280 --> 03:03.360
one of his home dogs, one of his homies, in the hood. Unfortunately, his fictional son is killed,

03:03.360 --> 03:08.880
and they go and ask Kendrick, what do I do? And then Kendrick, you know, he's got a loose filter

03:08.880 --> 03:19.520
on him, and he says, you know, so now you know that this album, this is just how Kendrick feels.

03:19.520 --> 03:24.320
And of course, the right flake give Kendrick a flag, because he states how he feels about

03:24.320 --> 03:30.560
Donald Trump. Now, I think, as previously mentioned, you can't really expect Kendrick Lamar

03:30.560 --> 03:35.680
to love Donald Trump. It's like Paul Joseph Watson, oh, Kendrick Lamar, he doesn't like

03:35.680 --> 03:43.120
Donald Trump, oh, he's just anti for left, he's anti for left, oh, he's a leftist liberal libtard.

03:43.120 --> 03:47.040
But then you remember that, of course, he's gonna see Donald Trump in that light, because

03:47.040 --> 03:55.440
he's grown up in the inner cities, and he's had a very tough life. Again, if you like Donald Trump,

03:56.080 --> 04:03.200
and you can't listen to Kendrick Lamar because he doesn't like Donald Trump, then, yeah, just

04:03.920 --> 04:13.760
end yourself, I don't know, stab yourself with a, with a, with a dreadlock, I don't know. Anyway,

04:13.760 --> 04:19.920
that's been my thing, thank you for having me on this video, I hope I added something,

04:19.920 --> 04:29.280
can't even remember what I said. Anyway, look at that, it's ended, he punches the camera.

04:29.280 --> 04:32.880
Thank you Vanilla Rice for helping me out with that one, very much appreciated. His

04:32.880 --> 04:36.320
channel will be linked in the description below. Now with politics comes critics,

04:36.320 --> 04:40.640
as shown by one of the audio clips right at the start in Blood. Fox News reacted rather badly to

04:40.640 --> 04:44.880
the song Alright, and in one of his preview songs for the album The Heart Part 4, he was also

04:44.880 --> 04:49.520
denounced by many right-wing commentators for labelling Donald Trump a chump, with many believing

04:49.520 --> 04:53.680
he was just another establishment mouthpiece. Rap music seems particularly hostile to those of the

04:53.680 --> 04:58.160
Trump persuasion, with Eminem and Snoop Dogg also taking shots in the last few months or so,

04:58.160 --> 05:02.400
some more verbal, others more physical. And to respond to that, what I would say is,

05:02.400 --> 05:06.480
why wouldn't it be hostile? Rap music culture is generally built around the struggles of inner

05:06.480 --> 05:10.800
city working class people, some of those least likely to vote for someone like Trump. I have

05:10.800 --> 05:14.240
regularly attacked critics of Trump for being out as touch socialites, but it doesn't mean everyone

05:14.240 --> 05:18.560
who attacks Trump is that. It's not like Kendrick is absolving the communities that he represents

05:18.560 --> 05:22.320
of any criticism, in fact in the song The Black and the Berry, my favourite song of his, his

05:22.320 --> 05:26.640
narrative shifts to expose the hypocrisy of many of the communities that he is actually from. That

05:26.640 --> 05:30.240
doesn't make him an extremist Trump supporter though, but yet we always seem to work with

05:30.240 --> 05:34.640
extremes. Most people seem to think you're either communist or fascist, when the truth is,

05:34.640 --> 05:39.120
you can exist without being either. Now I'm aware that Kendrick's comments of Trump being a chump

05:39.120 --> 05:43.040
aren't particularly constructive or useful, but nonetheless he's allowed to vent, people aren't

05:43.040 --> 05:47.120
entitled to an explanation, and he didn't preach it like he was trying to convert anyone. It

05:47.120 --> 05:51.280
doesn't annoy me at all, probably because I believe the insults come from a genuine place,

05:51.280 --> 05:56.880
and it wasn't so arrogant. If you want things that do piss me off, it's complacency and this

05:56.880 --> 06:01.600
false feeling of righteousness. A really good example of this was Josh Whedon's tweets mocking

06:01.600 --> 06:06.320
Paul Ryan upon his meeting of teenage cancer survivors. In contrast, Kendrick's music never

06:06.320 --> 06:09.840
has that feeling of righteousness, he runs a narrative and allows you to draw your own

06:09.840 --> 06:14.000
conclusion. Although the narrative may present its own opinions, it's always an open-ended matter,

06:14.000 --> 06:18.640
which is why his criticism always comes across as a lot less hostile, and also you get the feeling

06:18.640 --> 06:22.560
that he speaks from experience, and speaks from the heart, which makes a lot of his narrative a

06:22.560 --> 06:26.560
lot more reasonable. I don't believe rap music belongs to the political elite, it's a very

06:26.560 --> 06:30.000
strong weapon against political correctness, you could just look at Eminem for that, and it's also

06:30.000 --> 06:34.000
a way of giving the voiceless a voice, despite its misuse sometimes, which I acknowledge.

06:34.000 --> 06:37.920
Kendrick Lamar is many things, but I don't think his take on politics is one that negatively

06:37.920 --> 06:41.840
affects the current state of affairs. He's not a social justice warrior or Hollywood elitist,

06:41.840 --> 06:44.800
he's someone who's gone through genuine struggle, and that reflects in his music,

06:44.800 --> 06:48.240
and his music isn't entirely political, but it's dynamically in touch with the

06:48.240 --> 06:53.040
issues that many people face, and that's what matters to me. I'm the right opinion, and damn.
