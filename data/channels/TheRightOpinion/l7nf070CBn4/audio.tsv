0	2000	Bernie we need you
7200	12820	Hello ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the right opinion the home of a twat with too much free time and today
12820	16560	I lamented I lamented on the mess that was the first and second debates
16620	22100	Which I was far too nice on them in my reaction well the first one at least which I reacted to lively
22100	28340	I mean I do stand by one of the statements that I don't think that there was any clear winner strangely enough one of the
28380	31300	Comments I made was that I think Trump edged it
31300	33380	I wasn't thinking completely straight at the time
33380	39220	But actually as the polls came in despite all the pundits remarks that Hillary won people tended to prefer Trump
39500	43100	Americans in general tend to prefer someone with a bit more bombast in these debates
43100	50840	Which is why despite all his interrupting bumbling and fumbling he still came out on top of the electorate which is crazy
51260	54500	How has it come to this Hillary? How could you let that happen?
54580	59660	I made a video earlier this year concerning Hillary Clinton some of my apprehensions surrounding her
59660	66520	I'd like to make an apology because I seriously underplayed some of those apprehensions because she is just terrible an
66920	71640	Internet memes of her destroying Trump supposedly is not going to change people's minds
71960	76860	Despite all the scandals and issues that Trump is involved in she still fails to capitalize
76900	81200	It's incredible how incompetent she genuinely is and it made me think
81720	84540	Made me genuinely think where is Bernie
85440	89240	Bernie you were good. You were not just good. You were great
89240	94160	You were a person with a genuine belief in helping people you were thrashing Republicans in the polls
94160	100640	And now we've come to here with Hillary who flip-flops more than a pair of fucking sandals yet
100640	107440	She received endorsements from many supposedly progressive figures despite not being trustworthy to represent the people and this can be demonstrated
107480	111480	Demonstrated and to demonstrate that I've got my good friend and animator, mr.
111480	116680	Codswallop to put on a little show on some of Hillary's history. Take it away my friend
119400	120800	Welcome to the
120800	122800	1960s there was a major movement in the
123200	128680	1960s done if you've heard of it's called the civil rights movement and this was a gigantic step forward to end
128960	132760	Segregation in the United States, but I bet you're wondering how was it?
132760	138640	We'll add to Bernie Sanders and Hillary. Well, listen here you little bitch while I slap some fucking knowledge in your brain
138640	145240	So Bernie Sanders, you know who he is took the part of leading a group in Chicago University to protest against racial discrimination
145600	151760	And segregation in the university housing and this stunning young chap is Bernie, by the way
151760	158140	He took part in many protests in Chicago and stood by the side of Martin Luther King an absolute beautiful man
158660	159620	Kiss you
159620	166140	However, there's always the cunt to the story and his name is Barry Goldwater who was a Republican presidential candidate
166180	171260	Who was against putting an end to racial segregation as a whole bit of a wank if you ask me
171540	176620	So where was the dribbling wrench Hillary Clinton during all of this? Well, she was
177300	182340	Campaigning for Barry Goldwater, of course. I was a Goldwater girl. You know what that means
183260	186680	Yeah, she was she was a Republican at the time. She was a Republican
187480	189480	Pay that as you will
196680	200920	He had to research that shit to make that animation so go and give him some credit on his channel
200920	205880	I cannot praise him enough. I'll leave his link in the description as well Hillary landed under gunfire
205880	211240	She always believed in gay marriage her emails were a mistake and she always carries around hot sauce with her
211400	212920	There were just a few of her
212920	218640	Transparent lies that everyone saw through and yet she still won enough delegates despite being about as desirable as a vasectomy
219120	221680	To all those fellow keyboard warriors. I see out there
222600	227200	Bernie was a good man. He was on the right side of history. He was right about civil rights
227200	233720	He was right about the Iraq war and he was right about many of his policies about free tuition universal health care all
234080	237100	Initiatives that have proven to work well in different parts of the world
237220	243940	Yet Democrats have shot themselves in the foot with this nomination a person who makes the mistakes and then apologizes after
244300	248500	Hillary it'd be better if you didn't make the mistakes in the first place. I miss Bernie
248580	250860	He brought a passion and experience unmatched
250860	255180	He was extremely popular in swing states and would have been able to bring a left-leaning populism
255420	261500	Desperately yearned for by the public all over the world when people say they're surprised that Trump is doing strongly
261500	266700	I tell them I'm not Clinton is a puppet propelled by those who are only driven by the means of self-interest
266860	274160	In this political climate of angst annoyance of politicians Bernie would have slayed but there's not much we can do about it now
274320	278400	Once again, I'd like to thank mr. Codswallop and I implore you to check out his channel
278400	283580	He does a lot of interesting animation. I have complete respect for him given how hard it often is
283580	291020	I hope to report on some less frustrating news next time but until then I'm the right opinion. Fuck me. Not America
296700	298700	I
301740	306560	Just woke up on days that my afros not to reach under my mattress to grab my stash
