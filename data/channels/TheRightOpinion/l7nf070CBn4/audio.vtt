00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
Bernie we need you

00:07.200 --> 00:12.820
Hello ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the right opinion the home of a twat with too much free time and today

00:12.820 --> 00:16.560
I lamented I lamented on the mess that was the first and second debates

00:16.620 --> 00:22.100
Which I was far too nice on them in my reaction well the first one at least which I reacted to lively

00:22.100 --> 00:28.340
I mean I do stand by one of the statements that I don't think that there was any clear winner strangely enough one of the

00:28.380 --> 00:31.300
Comments I made was that I think Trump edged it

00:31.300 --> 00:33.380
I wasn't thinking completely straight at the time

00:33.380 --> 00:39.220
But actually as the polls came in despite all the pundits remarks that Hillary won people tended to prefer Trump

00:39.500 --> 00:43.100
Americans in general tend to prefer someone with a bit more bombast in these debates

00:43.100 --> 00:50.840
Which is why despite all his interrupting bumbling and fumbling he still came out on top of the electorate which is crazy

00:51.260 --> 00:54.500
How has it come to this Hillary? How could you let that happen?

00:54.580 --> 00:59.660
I made a video earlier this year concerning Hillary Clinton some of my apprehensions surrounding her

00:59.660 --> 01:06.520
I'd like to make an apology because I seriously underplayed some of those apprehensions because she is just terrible an

01:06.920 --> 01:11.640
Internet memes of her destroying Trump supposedly is not going to change people's minds

01:11.960 --> 01:16.860
Despite all the scandals and issues that Trump is involved in she still fails to capitalize

01:16.900 --> 01:21.200
It's incredible how incompetent she genuinely is and it made me think

01:21.720 --> 01:24.540
Made me genuinely think where is Bernie

01:25.440 --> 01:29.240
Bernie you were good. You were not just good. You were great

01:29.240 --> 01:34.160
You were a person with a genuine belief in helping people you were thrashing Republicans in the polls

01:34.160 --> 01:40.640
And now we've come to here with Hillary who flip-flops more than a pair of fucking sandals yet

01:40.640 --> 01:47.440
She received endorsements from many supposedly progressive figures despite not being trustworthy to represent the people and this can be demonstrated

01:47.480 --> 01:51.480
Demonstrated and to demonstrate that I've got my good friend and animator, mr.

01:51.480 --> 01:56.680
Codswallop to put on a little show on some of Hillary's history. Take it away my friend

01:59.400 --> 02:00.800
Welcome to the

02:00.800 --> 02:02.800
1960s there was a major movement in the

02:03.200 --> 02:08.680
1960s done if you've heard of it's called the civil rights movement and this was a gigantic step forward to end

02:08.960 --> 02:12.760
Segregation in the United States, but I bet you're wondering how was it?

02:12.760 --> 02:18.640
We'll add to Bernie Sanders and Hillary. Well, listen here you little bitch while I slap some fucking knowledge in your brain

02:18.640 --> 02:25.240
So Bernie Sanders, you know who he is took the part of leading a group in Chicago University to protest against racial discrimination

02:25.600 --> 02:31.760
And segregation in the university housing and this stunning young chap is Bernie, by the way

02:31.760 --> 02:38.140
He took part in many protests in Chicago and stood by the side of Martin Luther King an absolute beautiful man

02:38.660 --> 02:39.620
Kiss you

02:39.620 --> 02:46.140
However, there's always the cunt to the story and his name is Barry Goldwater who was a Republican presidential candidate

02:46.180 --> 02:51.260
Who was against putting an end to racial segregation as a whole bit of a wank if you ask me

02:51.540 --> 02:56.620
So where was the dribbling wrench Hillary Clinton during all of this? Well, she was

02:57.300 --> 03:02.340
Campaigning for Barry Goldwater, of course. I was a Goldwater girl. You know what that means

03:03.260 --> 03:06.680
Yeah, she was she was a Republican at the time. She was a Republican

03:07.480 --> 03:09.480
Pay that as you will

03:16.680 --> 03:20.920
He had to research that shit to make that animation so go and give him some credit on his channel

03:20.920 --> 03:25.880
I cannot praise him enough. I'll leave his link in the description as well Hillary landed under gunfire

03:25.880 --> 03:31.240
She always believed in gay marriage her emails were a mistake and she always carries around hot sauce with her

03:31.400 --> 03:32.920
There were just a few of her

03:32.920 --> 03:38.640
Transparent lies that everyone saw through and yet she still won enough delegates despite being about as desirable as a vasectomy

03:39.120 --> 03:41.680
To all those fellow keyboard warriors. I see out there

03:42.600 --> 03:47.200
Bernie was a good man. He was on the right side of history. He was right about civil rights

03:47.200 --> 03:53.720
He was right about the Iraq war and he was right about many of his policies about free tuition universal health care all

03:54.080 --> 03:57.100
Initiatives that have proven to work well in different parts of the world

03:57.220 --> 04:03.940
Yet Democrats have shot themselves in the foot with this nomination a person who makes the mistakes and then apologizes after

04:04.300 --> 04:08.500
Hillary it'd be better if you didn't make the mistakes in the first place. I miss Bernie

04:08.580 --> 04:10.860
He brought a passion and experience unmatched

04:10.860 --> 04:15.180
He was extremely popular in swing states and would have been able to bring a left-leaning populism

04:15.420 --> 04:21.500
Desperately yearned for by the public all over the world when people say they're surprised that Trump is doing strongly

04:21.500 --> 04:26.700
I tell them I'm not Clinton is a puppet propelled by those who are only driven by the means of self-interest

04:26.860 --> 04:34.160
In this political climate of angst annoyance of politicians Bernie would have slayed but there's not much we can do about it now

04:34.320 --> 04:38.400
Once again, I'd like to thank mr. Codswallop and I implore you to check out his channel

04:38.400 --> 04:43.580
He does a lot of interesting animation. I have complete respect for him given how hard it often is

04:43.580 --> 04:51.020
I hope to report on some less frustrating news next time but until then I'm the right opinion. Fuck me. Not America

04:56.700 --> 04:58.700
I

05:01.740 --> 05:06.560
Just woke up on days that my afros not to reach under my mattress to grab my stash
