0	5940	Monday, the 7th of May, 2018, 10.09 AM EST.
5940	9480	The sun shining, the flowers blooming, the day advancing.
9480	14620	However, not everything shone, not everything bloomed, and not everything advanced.
14620	18120	In fact, for the world surrounding Zoe Berger, the forecast was quite adverse.
18120	22920	In a series of revealing tweets, she let the world know of her condition, her circumstances,
22920	25480	and her state, figuratively and literally.
25480	29560	The tweets indicated that the once-renowned sexual provocateur had taken a sharp nosedive
29560	30560	into oblivion.
30560	32100	A sad story.
32100	36080	But how did she meet this fate, and more importantly, why?
50880	54240	Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of Atwat with
54240	55600	too much free time.
55600	58160	And today, I take a look at Zoe Berger.
58160	60960	Zoe Berger is or was a Twitch and YouTube streamer.
60960	66080	On the surface, that sounds fairly unexceptional, but Zoe had a twist, and a few twerks too.
66080	70640	She originally started involving herself in social media around the year of 2013, while
70640	72000	she was attending university.
72000	73000	That's relatable.
73000	76520	At least, I assume it was around then, as that was when her Twitter account was created,
76520	79440	and activity initiated.
79440	83960	But it wasn't until 2016, where she became particularly notorious amongst anyone within
83960	87200	the commentary sphere, for being extremely provocative with her content.
87240	90120	But there was a lot more going on beyond the surface.
90120	93880	As a Twitch streamer, she was banned four times, however, finding her feet on YouTube,
93880	96080	she hit one million in no time at all.
96080	97080	That is pretty incredible.
97080	100440	I remember when I first came across her, and I was almost stunned at the speed of such
100440	101440	growth.
101440	104760	Even with the reputation garnered being carried over from Twitch, it seems she was destined
104760	106260	to smash the platform.
106260	109480	After all, there's always going to be a demographic for her sort of content, right?
109480	112280	Zoe Berger, the face of YouTube.
112280	114440	Didn't quite happen, did it though?
114440	118960	In fact, as quickly as the success came, it just halted, and as of right now, she is on
118960	122920	the same subscriber count that she was on in December 2016.
122920	126700	Given her ascension was only in the space of a few months before then, the sudden cessation
126700	127700	was almost unbelievable.
127700	131440	Now, it's not exceptional for someone to fall as quickly as they rise, and there are
131440	136140	many scenarios in which this has occurred, but for something as consistently, well, dick-hardening
136140	140200	for many young whippersnappers, a stagnation seems at least slightly more difficult than
140200	141360	she made it out to be.
141360	145600	Plenty of other provocative females on the platform have been known to flaunt their physicality,
145600	147520	and they can hold onto their ground.
147520	151080	On top of that, it wasn't like she hadn't tried to branch beyond shaking her ass.
151080	154560	In fact, she had also attempted to start up her own little brand known as Lux.
154560	158600	It's clear that she invested a lot in this, and we'll investigate that more in a bit.
158600	162760	However, when the first generation of this little squadron exited at the end of 2017,
162760	167400	Zoe greeted 2018 with open arms, and vowed to give the next set of recruits all new and
167400	168760	exciting opportunities.
168760	171760	Mansion Shoot's production filming Zoe had a vision.
171760	175800	However, on the 8th of April, that came to an end with Lux devolving, and just over a
175800	179800	month later came the tweet in question, followed by numerous more tweets that represented a
179800	183480	unique turn in character from the once rather explicit streamer.
183480	186960	Where there is a rise, and there is a fall, there is an explanation.
186960	187960	For both.
187960	191560	I thought I'd conduct my own little inquiry into little details that led to the ascent
191560	195680	and subsequent descent for one of the most shameless characters on the platform.
195680	198800	Without further ado, let's get right into it.
203440	207160	If you use Twitch, you'll know that they run a pretty tight shift for a lot of their content,
207160	209520	particularly for that which may include provocation.
209520	213160	Provocative is one way of describing Zoe Burger's content, and one word that I'm probably going
213160	217840	to be using a lot today, so when she was kicked off inevitably, it was not a surprise, not
217840	218840	even to Zoe.
218840	220720	However, she did not seem too bothered.
220720	225160	After all, she found YouTube and an environment that perfectly fostered her meteoric rise
225160	227920	to stardom, or whatever you wanna fucking call it.
227920	232040	It seems unlikely that Zoe was the first Twitch streamer to ever be sexually provocative.
232040	234840	I'm sure there were plenty before, and there were plenty since.
234840	238560	However, she was definitely one of the first to be able to gain significant traction from
238560	242120	it, and unlike her contemporaries, there was no ambiguity about it.
242120	246080	She knew what she was doing when she was shaking that ass, and pulling the views.
246080	249780	I wanted to get a snapshot of her old Twitch, however for some reason the Wayback Machine
249780	252920	carried on telling me that all the screenshots for her channel had been shipped to another
252920	255120	castle which is fantastic.
255120	256400	Either way, I was not impressed.
256400	260440	I also wanted to be able to piece together a slightly more detailed timeline, but unfortunately
260440	264480	she sometimes just appeared to forget to fill in the text boxes, so her follower count was
264480	265480	often a mystery.
265480	269180	However, with a bit more digging, I did manage to find an old image taken before she went
269180	273320	viral in March 2016, showing that she had a decent amount of traction.
273320	276680	In fact, briefly after one of the occasions she was banned and had her account returned,
276680	279800	she reported receiving a shoutout from RiceGum of all people.
279800	287240	Isn't that curious?
287240	291280	So this inevitably gave her some groundswell, and eventually when she was kicked off Twitch
291280	295200	the fourth time, she moved to YouTube, with a significant amount of momentum she managed
295200	296400	to kickstart the channel.
296400	300560	You have a collection of highly active subs at that point, that looks great to a lot of
300560	305660	algorithmic mechanisms, so she gained and gained and gained, and it effectively snowballed.
305660	308040	But what did that snowball like?
309040	310040	B O O D Y
312040	314360	2016 was a strange year.
314360	318320	Gaming channels were in a tight spot, they hadn't effectively died like they had sometimes,
318320	322120	such as the pre-Fortnite drought, however there was a sentiment of stagnation, and they
322120	326360	needed a hero, someone to give it a new lease of life.
326360	327360	Zoey Burger.
327360	330920	Zoey Burger appealed to the fact that there is a significant demographic within the gaming
330920	335800	industry that are hormonal virgins, who jumped to the chance to watch someone juggle such
335800	337640	personality with gameplay.
337640	342000	Her thumbnails hit the sweet spot, and a lot of people justifiably asked why on earth she
342000	343920	was gaining any attention at all.
343920	347440	Why were people donating to see someone shake their ass when they could watch someone shake
347440	348880	their ass for free anywhere else?
348880	350280	That's an interesting question.
350280	354780	I think the idea of specific donations within the streams themselves almost gave the donor
354780	359800	a perverted sense of power, the fact that they had control, they were making her shake
359800	364560	her ass, the virtual representation of going to a strip club for them and throwing money
364560	368120	at the hookers, having someone shake their ass for them.
368120	372520	It was a nice little scheme that set her apart and knew how to appeal to certain psychological
372520	374000	switches in the mind.
374000	378060	Now of course this brought into question many moral challenges, with many content creators
378060	381480	attempting to have her channel terminated, but the lines were so blurred that it was
381480	385440	simply impossible to remove her from the platform, it also didn't help that a lot of people
385440	388920	were just attempting to eject her because she was busting that booty.
388920	392720	And if you've seen the latest music video for Tiger for example, and multiple other
392720	396480	artists within the music industry, you'll understand that if YouTube were to ban Zoe
396480	400280	Burger, there'd be even larger policy inconsistencies than the ones they have already.
400280	403780	The only deeper question is should she be shaking her ass for donations from kids who
403780	405740	probably aren't completely mature?
405740	409400	The problem is, although it's inevitable that it's happened, it's hard to establish
409400	413580	the age of such donors, so the best YouTube could do was age restrict the videos, which
413580	415400	in all fairness they did sometimes.
415400	419960	However every kid knows how to bypass that, they're not dumb twats, it's an onerous
419960	424480	complication to say the least, and riding on the wave, Burger knew exactly how to take
424480	428540	advantage of that, she'd get the clicks, she'd get the dicks.
428540	432100	However when your content is growing fast through the methods of provocation, it gains
432100	437640	the attention of something equally ravenous, drama, and damn was it spicy.
437640	440660	You see there were many commentators who took protest to the fact that her content was on
440660	444340	YouTube, and that it was being promoted too, so they made videos on it.
444340	448180	Now I must stress, not everyone you make a video on will gain from it, if you can deliver
448180	451940	criticism in a damning fashion, then you can stifle someone's growth.
451940	456420	In this instance many commentators were hoping to bring YouTube's awareness to the situation,
456420	460840	and effectively have her removed, however in this instance the drama was a perfect storm
460840	461880	to propel her.
461880	465380	The criticism that many of these commentators dished out was levied from a point of view
465380	467180	concerned with moral conduct.
467180	471100	Now sometimes moral conduct can be fairly black and white, but the moral issue here
471100	475860	came with indulgence, so many people responded, well Zoe's having a good time, the viewers
475860	478380	are having a good time too, who's losing?
478380	482900	And some of these commentators have significant overlap into the sort of demographic who enjoyed
482900	486340	Zoe's content, so no one felt particularly guilty supporting her.
486340	490380	She wasn't explicitly abusing anyone, she wasn't touching kids to our knowledge, and
490380	494180	the anonymity of the donors allowed people to fill in the gaps with their most ideal
494180	497980	scenario to morally justify the system that they were participating in.
497980	501500	It was a smart business model that worked perfectly for her.
501500	503460	And then there was the drama with RiceGum.
503460	508220	This was one of the few RiceGum videos that I've ever watched, fun fact, and his acting
508220	509220	is terrible.
509220	514020	I mean you can tell he's not being legitimate, and it's very very transparent, and because
514020	518020	once again the whole tone of the video was mild and light hearted, it just bolstered
518020	522460	Zoe even more, and that's what it was meant to do, it was a good scheme by two people
522460	524100	in the same network.
524100	527700	And through this Zoe essentially managed to smoothly transition her content from Twitch
527700	530380	to YouTube, maximising her success.
530380	534220	She would also regularly make video responses and call out people herself.
534220	538140	A lot of her arguments fell rather flat to be honest, but one thing that never got old
538140	542100	was the fact that she could do what she wants, and if YouTube had a problem they could get
542100	545780	rid of her themselves, which was always fairly indestructible.
545780	550380	She gradually escalated her escapades, eventually offering news for 1 million subscribers, a
550380	552220	goal she reached incredibly quickly.
552220	557220	Zoe Burger was YouTube's next star, she had amassed such a huge amount of followers in
557220	560580	no time at all, the Empire had been constructed.
560580	564580	But what she had constructed was a house of cards, and a gust of wind was just around
564580	574020	the corner.
574020	579500	How can something be constructed so emphatically yet have so many holes in?
579500	584460	Zoe Burger's glass house was just a stone's throwaway for many people ready to take her
584460	587540	down, yet the real assailant was herself.
587540	588540	What do I mean?
588540	590820	Well we've got time to break it down, so why don't we?
590820	595860	Now novelty isn't always a bad thing, however there are two key clinchers with it, two that
595860	598380	Zoe herself could not hold onto.
598380	602460	Firstly novelty banks on the fact that no one is doing it, and for certain talents that
602460	606740	is fine, there are some very niche persuasions that would take excessive amounts of effort
606740	609660	to reach any sort of distinguished level of skill at all.
609660	614380	With all due respect to her craft, Zoe Burger's brand of shaking her ass in front of the camera
614380	619060	was not anything exceptional, the only noteworthy element was that she was the first to mix
619060	623220	all of these elements together, but once people know the recipe, they're gonna get cooking.
623220	626740	And as PewDiePie's recent content on various Twitch streamers has showed, there's always
626740	630700	an audience, and whereas Zoe was banned from the platform, many of these new females very
630700	634300	carefully walk the line between what is acceptable, and what is not.
634300	638760	So by even being allowed on Twitch, this new set of creators had an advantage, and so when
638760	642900	more creators came along, and the competition intensified, it no longer became a case of
642900	646660	who did it first, it became a case of who was doing it best.
646660	650720	The second problem with novelty is that it can't just be a gimmick, which is what a lot
650720	655420	of Zoe Burger's sexual content was, it was a gimmick, she was known as a person who twerked
655420	657980	on Call of Duty streams for money, that was the hook.
657980	662340	In one of her earlier videos she says that she's aware she doesn't have the most personality,
662340	663940	and yes, she doesn't.
663940	668540	And that's a problem, brief, spur of the moment trends and titles can give you a significant
668540	672080	following, but that following won't stick around if you don't have anything to bring
672080	673080	them back for.
673080	676760	Unfortunately there was nothing that many people who watched Zoe Burger would come back
676760	681360	to enjoy, and as the competition rose, and people found other streamers, the motivation
681360	685720	to return to her content was less and less, and although it didn't have to be that way,
685720	691680	she didn't really help herself in any situation either, and probably accelerated her downfall.
691680	695440	You see, I've never enjoyed the you're just giving them attention argument, because even
695440	699720	if it does bring someone some increase in attention over the short term, it can have
699720	705160	significant effects in detracting from them long term, and Zoe Burger is a perfect example
705160	706160	of this.
706160	707900	She isn't very good at arguing.
707900	712160	At first it was alright, she was arguing against people who she could definitely frame as quite
712160	717380	imposing, and she was this defender of being able to do what she wants, that was fine.
717380	721700	But then you had other people, such as Pyrocynical, whose videos weren't just aimless rants,
721700	724740	they were more nuanced takes on what she might be doing wrong.
724740	729680	Although her response may have quickly gained attention because she's responding to Pyrocynical,
729680	733360	Pyrocynical's response video has three times the views that his original one does.
733360	737120	And even when your whole business model is based around twerking, a bit of integrity
737120	741600	is still important, and once the drama faded there just wasn't interest, she had been shown
741600	745320	to be a hypocrite one too many times, and she couldn't just fall back onto the same
745320	749800	excuses that she had before, because not everyone is going to argue whether she should or should
749800	753720	not be on the internet, there are going to be people who take more moderate positions.
753720	757780	The only reason that she released the response to Pyrocynical was because it would get viewed,
757780	761240	and saying that she doesn't make the type of video multiple times doesn't change the
761240	766020	fact that she made the video and fucked up because her line of argument was just weak.
766020	769800	However this wasn't the end of the drama, you see we just mentioned gimmicks, and obviously
769800	774300	when your channel is partly composed of a gimmick that has an expiry date, you gradually
774300	779500	escalate and escalate and escalate the antics to maintain viewership, it's like a roller
779500	784200	coaster, you extend the incline a bit further but only heighten the inevitable drop.
784200	788820	This was represented by a situation regarding nudes, the nude offering was that escalation
788820	794460	for Zoe Burger, she was going to give all the viewers nudes at 1 million subscribers,
794460	798920	and she hit 1 million, and obviously in an attempt to avoid channel termination, didn't
798920	802520	really show any nudes at all, and all the horny young lads who were subscribed to her
802520	807640	for it experienced great disappointment. This was Zoe Burger's most prominent stunt, but
807640	811740	at the same time it represented the beginning of the drop for that roller coaster ride,
811740	816120	and as the subs bled and she was hit with another copyright strike, which I must clarify
816120	820380	was for an unrelated video, she lashed out at everyone under the sun, from SS Sniper
820380	825440	Wolf, to FaZe Clan, to Daddy Ricegum, quite clearly trying to start anything, but that
825440	828520	ship had sailed, and Zoe was still at the port.
828520	834180	Can you maintain a consistent state of drama? Yes, I do believe you can, but it has to be
834180	839280	constantly adapting and evolving to the necessary circumstances, a lot of Zoe's drama was
839280	843740	oh my god, she shakes her ass for money. It's quite two dimensional, and eventually it's
843740	848380	a debate that you realise both sides are not going to compromise on, people become bored
848380	852940	and move on, you can just hope YouTube is on your side, right?
852940	857760	2017. It wasn't the best time to be any sort of R-rated YouTuber, I've mentioned
857760	861940	him before but NerdCity made a great video documenting his findings on a study conducted
861940	866140	by researcher CeeLo. The results showed that if your video was rated M for Mature, it was
866140	870240	likely to significantly affect the views and promotion that it receives, this was not
870240	874980	a friendly algorithm to someone like Zoe Burger. Now gameplay channels were already being marked
874980	880260	with an M, and on top of that, her other offerings to these videos were pretty mature, much of
880260	884800	her work was age restricted, and if your videos are age restricted, you know that it dies
884800	888940	a horrible death on the algorithm, and let's face it, YouTube wouldn't want someone like
888940	891820	Zoe Burger to be one of their most sizeable channels.
891820	895900	And in all fairness, she did try other content where she still behaved seductively, but with
895900	900080	a slightly more marketable vibe. However, this essentially put her in a paradox because
900080	904560	the original appeal was how downright shameless she was, and at this point, her switching
904560	909260	content to stuff marginally more dignified was like attempting to polish a prostitute,
909260	913040	she either could do the more crude content and risk being punished by YouTube, or do
913040	917460	more sophisticated works and undermine her whole appeal in the first place.
917460	923160	2017 was not a good year to be anything on YouTube, especially Zoe Burger, and in her
923160	927500	defence, she did anticipate that. However, with that said, although her channel wasn't
927500	931560	on the hot streak that her original content was, there were still the odd couple of videos
931560	936000	that seemed to do well, and although it was definitely quite turbulent, it wasn't fully
936000	941960	dead. So what killed it? What was the nail in the Zoe Burger coffin? Let's talk about
941960	949120	Lux.
949120	952960	Lux was Zoe's gaming initiative that would branch beyond her, it was her all female
952960	957480	gaming team, and it was going to reach a new demographic. Now on paper, this is not
957480	962160	a disastrous idea, having a few extra people does create a new dynamic, and although it
962160	966800	can sometimes water down individual personalities, I don't think personality was ever Zoe's
966800	970760	strong point, and therefore multiplying the number of on-screen asses wasn't exactly
970760	975100	an awful idea. This was something that Zoe clearly felt passionate about, and she was
975100	979760	promoting it tirelessly. Many of her videos have gone just from her to this new acquired
979760	983780	squad, the views weren't exceptional, but they were consistent, what she needed to keep
983780	987920	going. However, many of the problems that plagued Zoe Burger on her own remained prominent
987920	992260	on Lux, they still didn't have a huge grip on the personality, there was nothing exceptional
992260	996600	about their gameplay, unfortunately they're just not the most skilled people. As the videos
996600	1001280	decreased in number, the views did too, and then on the 21st of December, two of the founding
1001280	1005180	members announced their departure from the group. The door was closing on Zoe, she had
1005180	1008920	exhausted multiple options at this point, the lone streams weren't doing the numbers,
1008920	1013120	the Lux streams didn't quite carry the burden necessary, so what could she do? On the same
1013120	1017140	night that the girls tweeted out about their exit, Zoe put out a video, in which she explained
1017140	1021220	that she had great plans for Lux and that it wasn't over, she was going to be putting
1021220	1026940	110% into it, everything, balls to the wall. And that's what we needed, in a way, we needed
1026940	1032040	a balls to the wall Zoe Burger, but it's not quite what we got. On the 2nd of February
1032040	1037540	2018, Zoe released her trailer for the new Lux, this one was more glamorous, higher production
1037540	1042200	value, and all-round more polished. The first episode was dropped on their own dedicated
1042200	1053080	channel and, shit, it was a huge bomb, and it was even worse considering the visible
1053080	1057100	investment being made in it, and it's time to explain everything that went tragically
1057100	1060920	wrong with this. Firstly, they should not have put it on a separate channel, that was
1060920	1064760	a terrible idea, it may have been an attempt to give it its own unique branding, but it
1064760	1069780	just opened it up for a new torrent, away from the protection of her retained fanbase.
1069780	1073500	Any seasoned YouTuber will tell you that as soon as you have a like-dislike ratio lower
1073500	1077980	than 50% then YouTube pulled the video from recommended altogether, so given the fact
1077980	1082780	that these were pretty much blitzed by dislikes, it killed any prospect that it had of growth.
1082780	1087260	The content itself, although not entirely incompetent, was just rather boring, it was
1087260	1092860	plagued by the problem that all Zoe's content was plagued by, a lack of personality. Increasing
1092860	1097520	the number of people also didn't help, given the chemistry was just rather stilted, I accept
1097520	1101000	that they hadn't known each other for long when they filmed, but you have to take that
1101000	1105920	naivety and turn it into something riveting, and there was nothing cinematic about it,
1105920	1111000	they spent around a third of the episode in a fucking limo. Only a selection of compelling
1111000	1115400	events can occur within the confinement of a limo, I was more interested in how it obtained
1115400	1119680	that huge dent, and why they used an instrumental that sounded like a bargain-barrel version
1119680	1121100	of an old Dennis Edwards song.
1141720	1145820	In case anyone wonders how I know these things, it's because I breathe music. But anyway,
1145820	1149800	back to the point, it was clearly trying to be higher in its production value than
1149800	1153740	it actually was, and because of this it did not gain an identity, it didn't manage to
1153740	1157860	take a direction, and therefore it could not keep viewers engaged, and that's not even
1157860	1162420	the most gaping issue, and I can't believe I'm saying that. But the most considerable
1162420	1167660	reason why this failed, is because it was the most visible example of how Zoe Burger
1167660	1171860	lost sight of what made her popular in the first place. As I said earlier, she acknowledged
1171860	1176960	that she wasn't a tour de force in personality, so the idea of basing something around their
1176960	1183020	personality is insane, it's career suicide. Unfortunately, a lot of people are not interested
1183020	1187280	in the plight of booty streamers, and I'm really sorry to say this because we all have
1187280	1191620	our own struggles and inner demons, and we shouldn't necessarily hide them from the
1191620	1196380	world, but Zoe could not sell that to an audience, and after a lot of the initial drama undermined
1196380	1201300	her credibility, she was never going to present her character as compelling or even refined
1201300	1206100	or legitimate. People followed Zoe for her buttocks, and I'm sorry, and although it's
1206100	1210860	shallow, it's a culture that I would not agree with, but in effect that's the way it is,
1210860	1216980	and Zoe was aware of that, and embraced it, she loved it for a moment, she made her bed,
1216980	1221540	and she lay in it. After three episodes with diminishing returns, the second Lux group
1221540	1226660	disbanded. It is fair to say that it was Zoe's worst mistake, and unfortunately it led us
1226660	1231160	here today, it was a foolishly ambitious move, and I know that risk taking is sometimes a
1231160	1235240	necessity to gain success, however she should've realised that the odds were stacked against
1235240	1239720	her in this instance, so why on earth would she chase something so destined to fail? Well
1239720	1243800	to be honest from what I've watched, it was her trying to get back in touch with the authentic
1243800	1248800	element, who she really was, even though it became grossly warped, and it takes me to
1248800	1250200	my final point.
1250200	1256280	One of the constituents that I found myself observing fairly frequently when watching
1256280	1260680	her content was how forced a lot of it was, the twerking was like a routine, personality
1260680	1265320	was non-existent, nothing felt genuine, in her drama video she'd contradict herself
1265320	1269440	innumerable amounts of times, the emotion seemed contrived, and it led me to the conclusion
1269440	1272960	that she was either desperately lacking in self awareness, or she was running on one
1272960	1277120	concept which she only knew how to handle by stretching it out further and further,
1277120	1280580	and as she felt herself getting sucked into this hole, she just attempted to tighten her
1280580	1287000	grip on the few handles that she had hold of, and that all imploded. But unfortunately
1287000	1291440	you cannot do that forever, sometimes as creators and we're desperate, we find something
1291440	1295600	that works, but then to maintain it we do it more, and more, and more, and more, and
1295600	1301160	we keep hoping that we find gold and recapture the original magic that bolted us into stardom.
1301160	1305700	However, time transpires and people lose their interest because you built your kingdom on
1305700	1310960	rickety foundations, that's what Zoe Burger stood on, a lie, a lie that this is what she
1310960	1315120	wanted, a lie that this is what she needed, and with all the drama and with all the bullshit
1315120	1320120	she dug herself a deeper and deeper hole. She tried to retain what made her famous,
1320120	1323720	she tried to galvanise her career through Lux, and then she tried to touch on something
1323720	1328400	more bona fide, and everything just led to a dead end because the original concept that
1328400	1333280	she constructed herself on was not sustainable, unfortunately in the YouTube game you either
1333280	1337120	die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become irrelevant.
1337120	1340840	And that's the problem with Zoe, it's the end for her, and this takes us to the Twitter
1340840	1345320	post, and the ones after, that showed what we should have seen, it was a desperate act
1345320	1349360	that went on for much longer than it should have. Zoe unfortunately caught herself in
1349360	1354080	something that many investors would call the sunk cost fallacy, the idea that we stay invested
1354080	1358520	in something based on our previous investments in the hope that it gets better, but it doesn't,
1358520	1362520	but we keep doing it and doing it until we have nothing left, and we're moving back to
1362520	1366920	our parent state. These things won't alleviate themselves unless we find a way to branch
1366920	1371360	it out, but Zoe had worn out a lot of the appeal that many people had found in her to
1371360	1376880	begin with, it was all opportunistic ass shaking, and as my previous segments have documented,
1376880	1380840	that's not enough in the modern environment when you're competing with people who have
1380840	1385700	advantages against you in all departments, and unfortunately although I think Zoe was
1385700	1390560	willing to change, she went into various different industries that she had equally insufficient
1390560	1395520	skill sets to succeed in, she turned down this bizarre road, and that's what confused
1395520	1400680	me the most, it was like throwing the anchor out, on a sinking ship, even as the water
1400680	1405880	reached your waistline, it was a delusion. In one video that is distinctly more realistic
1405880	1410200	than others, she laments all these decisions that she's made, and for the first time, it
1410200	1414160	was kinda sad, it didn't feel like she was just crying to try and emotionally appeal
1414160	1418480	to the twitch gods to let her back in, it felt like she realised where she stood, and
1418480	1423320	it left her empty. When we act to maintain an image, it takes its toll, especially in
1423320	1428200	cases like Zoe Burgers, where there was clearly a subconscious yearning for a return to something
1428200	1432780	more genuine, something more innocent, and looking back on her legacy as the twitch streamer
1432780	1438320	who exploited a little more than cleavage for views, yeah, I'd be pretty disappointed
1438320	1442040	too. She thought Lux could provide that sort of fresh start, but all it did was create
1442040	1445860	business relationships with people who she considered friends before, which subsequently
1445860	1450240	broke down the genuine elements of her life that she valued. Above all, what I've observed
1450240	1454760	is that Zoe's just too impulsive with how she acts, as she says in this video, she really
1454760	1459520	tries to save money but often that doesn't happen, she has a vision and chases it, and
1459520	1464600	it doesn't work out, and that's how this whole thing started, Lux was not a realistic passion
1464600	1469200	and it was not going to launch her, she was someone twerking on camera for the dollar,
1469200	1472600	and that is fine, but she never thought about how that might change, she never thought about
1472600	1476600	how to adapt to altering environments, even when she consciously acknowledged her own
1476600	1480840	flaws she acted like a person in denial, hoping that the audience would somehow take
1480840	1484920	to her. She thought that she could transition and escape the stigma, while forgetting that
1484920	1489040	it was simultaneously the stigma that made her popular in the first place, by deserting
1489040	1493360	that audience to pursue something idealistic, when she returned the audience wasn't there
1493360	1497640	either, she basically dug her own grave. Zoe, you're never going to have that respect from
1497640	1502360	a majority of people, I'm sorry, but that is how you popularise yourself, unfortunately
1502360	1506200	Twerking is not a personality trait, it's a gimmick, and if you have nothing else to
1506200	1511000	supplement that, it will become tiresome very quickly, your rise was too fast to be true,
1511000	1515440	your fall too fateful to be false, and this is where I'd like to leave a message to you,
1515440	1516440	the audience.
1516440	1521000	If you want a career that will be known fondly, supported through times when you trend and
1521000	1525040	times when you don't, if you want to pursue other careers and still want that core fanbase
1525040	1531760	who may not have great interest in it, it's about respect. Zoe's whole gimmick was self-objectification,
1531760	1536200	a concept inherently antithetical to the notion of respect, and whenever she tried
1536200	1541360	to go deeper she came across as lousily shallow or easily debunked, this prevented her from
1541360	1545080	being able to develop a character, as she was trying to base her developments off a
1545080	1549200	character that even she didn't believe in, and that's such an important point, if you
1549200	1553520	want to develop yourself, I think that's great, but it has to come from a genuine place, and
1553520	1558160	everything about Zoe's persona was synthetic, if you want to try and develop something fake,
1558160	1562920	all you do is expose how fake it truly is, people came for brainless content, you try
1562920	1566560	and give it a brain and you'll just end up with some fucked Frankenstein's monster of
1566560	1571080	a persona that doesn't compel anyone, because it doesn't make sense, and when you expand
1571080	1576000	as much effort as Zoe did trying to make sense of it, it will inevitably fail, and that is
1576000	1577000	sad.
1577000	1580940	I don't think there's anything wrong with exaggerated and elaborated personas, everyone's
1580940	1586000	persona is slightly different from their personality, but keep them based in reality, base them
1586000	1590240	in some form of respect, any form of respect, and you will vastly increase your chances
1590240	1595040	of longevity on this platform, there are often faster and easier ways to success, but it's
1595040	1600040	only a matter of time before they become highly precarious, Zoe Burger is a prime example
1600040	1603960	of that, she was only interesting when she was being something that she wasn't, a gimmick
1603960	1608160	that was exposed when she tried to return to her roots, and has led us to this sorry
1608160	1609400	situation.
1609400	1613760	I hope she finds herself, but I do not think it will be on this platform, I think it's
1613760	1617720	time for her to give it a break, and move on.
1617720	1619040	What do you think of Zoe Burger?
1619040	1622840	I'd love to hear your diagnosis, let me know, in the comments below I'd also like to give
1622840	1626900	a humongous thanks to the editors who have done another great job on this, I'm going
1626900	1630160	to leave their links down below and you should definitely check them out if you have the
1630160	1634060	chance and send them some love, without that talent this channel would not be here today
1634060	1635960	so I really can't thank them enough.
1635960	1639920	I also get asked a lot what sort of content I enjoy, and I'll often retweet it on my
1639920	1644320	Twitter which is at the right opinion, however I also have a group of creators who I really
1644320	1649200	think have great potential, known as the NCO, and we tweet out their content on the at NCO
1649200	1653360	underscore tweets, I'll leave that link in the description below and pinned comment too.
1653360	1656960	You can reach me on Facebook and Discord, though I don't promote content beyond my own
1656960	1657960	on there.
1657960	1660760	Anyhow I'd like to thank everyone for the support of recent, it's been very impressive
1660760	1664200	and it means a lot, and I look forward to chatting with all of you in the future.
1664200	1668600	Until then however, I'm The Right Opinion, and I'll see you, in the next one.
