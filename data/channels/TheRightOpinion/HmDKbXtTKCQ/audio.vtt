00:00.000 --> 00:05.940
Monday, the 7th of May, 2018, 10.09 AM EST.

00:05.940 --> 00:09.480
The sun shining, the flowers blooming, the day advancing.

00:09.480 --> 00:14.620
However, not everything shone, not everything bloomed, and not everything advanced.

00:14.620 --> 00:18.120
In fact, for the world surrounding Zoe Berger, the forecast was quite adverse.

00:18.120 --> 00:22.920
In a series of revealing tweets, she let the world know of her condition, her circumstances,

00:22.920 --> 00:25.480
and her state, figuratively and literally.

00:25.480 --> 00:29.560
The tweets indicated that the once-renowned sexual provocateur had taken a sharp nosedive

00:29.560 --> 00:30.560
into oblivion.

00:30.560 --> 00:32.100
A sad story.

00:32.100 --> 00:36.080
But how did she meet this fate, and more importantly, why?

00:50.880 --> 00:54.240
Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of Atwat with

00:54.240 --> 00:55.600
too much free time.

00:55.600 --> 00:58.160
And today, I take a look at Zoe Berger.

00:58.160 --> 01:00.960
Zoe Berger is or was a Twitch and YouTube streamer.

01:00.960 --> 01:06.080
On the surface, that sounds fairly unexceptional, but Zoe had a twist, and a few twerks too.

01:06.080 --> 01:10.640
She originally started involving herself in social media around the year of 2013, while

01:10.640 --> 01:12.000
she was attending university.

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
That's relatable.

01:13.000 --> 01:16.520
At least, I assume it was around then, as that was when her Twitter account was created,

01:16.520 --> 01:19.440
and activity initiated.

01:19.440 --> 01:23.960
But it wasn't until 2016, where she became particularly notorious amongst anyone within

01:23.960 --> 01:27.200
the commentary sphere, for being extremely provocative with her content.

01:27.240 --> 01:30.120
But there was a lot more going on beyond the surface.

01:30.120 --> 01:33.880
As a Twitch streamer, she was banned four times, however, finding her feet on YouTube,

01:33.880 --> 01:36.080
she hit one million in no time at all.

01:36.080 --> 01:37.080
That is pretty incredible.

01:37.080 --> 01:40.440
I remember when I first came across her, and I was almost stunned at the speed of such

01:40.440 --> 01:41.440
growth.

01:41.440 --> 01:44.760
Even with the reputation garnered being carried over from Twitch, it seems she was destined

01:44.760 --> 01:46.260
to smash the platform.

01:46.260 --> 01:49.480
After all, there's always going to be a demographic for her sort of content, right?

01:49.480 --> 01:52.280
Zoe Berger, the face of YouTube.

01:52.280 --> 01:54.440
Didn't quite happen, did it though?

01:54.440 --> 01:58.960
In fact, as quickly as the success came, it just halted, and as of right now, she is on

01:58.960 --> 02:02.920
the same subscriber count that she was on in December 2016.

02:02.920 --> 02:06.700
Given her ascension was only in the space of a few months before then, the sudden cessation

02:06.700 --> 02:07.700
was almost unbelievable.

02:07.700 --> 02:11.440
Now, it's not exceptional for someone to fall as quickly as they rise, and there are

02:11.440 --> 02:16.140
many scenarios in which this has occurred, but for something as consistently, well, dick-hardening

02:16.140 --> 02:20.200
for many young whippersnappers, a stagnation seems at least slightly more difficult than

02:20.200 --> 02:21.360
she made it out to be.

02:21.360 --> 02:25.600
Plenty of other provocative females on the platform have been known to flaunt their physicality,

02:25.600 --> 02:27.520
and they can hold onto their ground.

02:27.520 --> 02:31.080
On top of that, it wasn't like she hadn't tried to branch beyond shaking her ass.

02:31.080 --> 02:34.560
In fact, she had also attempted to start up her own little brand known as Lux.

02:34.560 --> 02:38.600
It's clear that she invested a lot in this, and we'll investigate that more in a bit.

02:38.600 --> 02:42.760
However, when the first generation of this little squadron exited at the end of 2017,

02:42.760 --> 02:47.400
Zoe greeted 2018 with open arms, and vowed to give the next set of recruits all new and

02:47.400 --> 02:48.760
exciting opportunities.

02:48.760 --> 02:51.760
Mansion Shoot's production filming Zoe had a vision.

02:51.760 --> 02:55.800
However, on the 8th of April, that came to an end with Lux devolving, and just over a

02:55.800 --> 02:59.800
month later came the tweet in question, followed by numerous more tweets that represented a

02:59.800 --> 03:03.480
unique turn in character from the once rather explicit streamer.

03:03.480 --> 03:06.960
Where there is a rise, and there is a fall, there is an explanation.

03:06.960 --> 03:07.960
For both.

03:07.960 --> 03:11.560
I thought I'd conduct my own little inquiry into little details that led to the ascent

03:11.560 --> 03:15.680
and subsequent descent for one of the most shameless characters on the platform.

03:15.680 --> 03:18.800
Without further ado, let's get right into it.

03:23.440 --> 03:27.160
If you use Twitch, you'll know that they run a pretty tight shift for a lot of their content,

03:27.160 --> 03:29.520
particularly for that which may include provocation.

03:29.520 --> 03:33.160
Provocative is one way of describing Zoe Burger's content, and one word that I'm probably going

03:33.160 --> 03:37.840
to be using a lot today, so when she was kicked off inevitably, it was not a surprise, not

03:37.840 --> 03:38.840
even to Zoe.

03:38.840 --> 03:40.720
However, she did not seem too bothered.

03:40.720 --> 03:45.160
After all, she found YouTube and an environment that perfectly fostered her meteoric rise

03:45.160 --> 03:47.920
to stardom, or whatever you wanna fucking call it.

03:47.920 --> 03:52.040
It seems unlikely that Zoe was the first Twitch streamer to ever be sexually provocative.

03:52.040 --> 03:54.840
I'm sure there were plenty before, and there were plenty since.

03:54.840 --> 03:58.560
However, she was definitely one of the first to be able to gain significant traction from

03:58.560 --> 04:02.120
it, and unlike her contemporaries, there was no ambiguity about it.

04:02.120 --> 04:06.080
She knew what she was doing when she was shaking that ass, and pulling the views.

04:06.080 --> 04:09.780
I wanted to get a snapshot of her old Twitch, however for some reason the Wayback Machine

04:09.780 --> 04:12.920
carried on telling me that all the screenshots for her channel had been shipped to another

04:12.920 --> 04:15.120
castle which is fantastic.

04:15.120 --> 04:16.400
Either way, I was not impressed.

04:16.400 --> 04:20.440
I also wanted to be able to piece together a slightly more detailed timeline, but unfortunately

04:20.440 --> 04:24.480
she sometimes just appeared to forget to fill in the text boxes, so her follower count was

04:24.480 --> 04:25.480
often a mystery.

04:25.480 --> 04:29.180
However, with a bit more digging, I did manage to find an old image taken before she went

04:29.180 --> 04:33.320
viral in March 2016, showing that she had a decent amount of traction.

04:33.320 --> 04:36.680
In fact, briefly after one of the occasions she was banned and had her account returned,

04:36.680 --> 04:39.800
she reported receiving a shoutout from RiceGum of all people.

04:39.800 --> 04:47.240
Isn't that curious?

04:47.240 --> 04:51.280
So this inevitably gave her some groundswell, and eventually when she was kicked off Twitch

04:51.280 --> 04:55.200
the fourth time, she moved to YouTube, with a significant amount of momentum she managed

04:55.200 --> 04:56.400
to kickstart the channel.

04:56.400 --> 05:00.560
You have a collection of highly active subs at that point, that looks great to a lot of

05:00.560 --> 05:05.660
algorithmic mechanisms, so she gained and gained and gained, and it effectively snowballed.

05:05.660 --> 05:08.040
But what did that snowball like?

05:09.040 --> 05:10.040
B O O D Y

05:12.040 --> 05:14.360
2016 was a strange year.

05:14.360 --> 05:18.320
Gaming channels were in a tight spot, they hadn't effectively died like they had sometimes,

05:18.320 --> 05:22.120
such as the pre-Fortnite drought, however there was a sentiment of stagnation, and they

05:22.120 --> 05:26.360
needed a hero, someone to give it a new lease of life.

05:26.360 --> 05:27.360
Zoey Burger.

05:27.360 --> 05:30.920
Zoey Burger appealed to the fact that there is a significant demographic within the gaming

05:30.920 --> 05:35.800
industry that are hormonal virgins, who jumped to the chance to watch someone juggle such

05:35.800 --> 05:37.640
personality with gameplay.

05:37.640 --> 05:42.000
Her thumbnails hit the sweet spot, and a lot of people justifiably asked why on earth she

05:42.000 --> 05:43.920
was gaining any attention at all.

05:43.920 --> 05:47.440
Why were people donating to see someone shake their ass when they could watch someone shake

05:47.440 --> 05:48.880
their ass for free anywhere else?

05:48.880 --> 05:50.280
That's an interesting question.

05:50.280 --> 05:54.780
I think the idea of specific donations within the streams themselves almost gave the donor

05:54.780 --> 05:59.800
a perverted sense of power, the fact that they had control, they were making her shake

05:59.800 --> 06:04.560
her ass, the virtual representation of going to a strip club for them and throwing money

06:04.560 --> 06:08.120
at the hookers, having someone shake their ass for them.

06:08.120 --> 06:12.520
It was a nice little scheme that set her apart and knew how to appeal to certain psychological

06:12.520 --> 06:14.000
switches in the mind.

06:14.000 --> 06:18.060
Now of course this brought into question many moral challenges, with many content creators

06:18.060 --> 06:21.480
attempting to have her channel terminated, but the lines were so blurred that it was

06:21.480 --> 06:25.440
simply impossible to remove her from the platform, it also didn't help that a lot of people

06:25.440 --> 06:28.920
were just attempting to eject her because she was busting that booty.

06:28.920 --> 06:32.720
And if you've seen the latest music video for Tiger for example, and multiple other

06:32.720 --> 06:36.480
artists within the music industry, you'll understand that if YouTube were to ban Zoe

06:36.480 --> 06:40.280
Burger, there'd be even larger policy inconsistencies than the ones they have already.

06:40.280 --> 06:43.780
The only deeper question is should she be shaking her ass for donations from kids who

06:43.780 --> 06:45.740
probably aren't completely mature?

06:45.740 --> 06:49.400
The problem is, although it's inevitable that it's happened, it's hard to establish

06:49.400 --> 06:53.580
the age of such donors, so the best YouTube could do was age restrict the videos, which

06:53.580 --> 06:55.400
in all fairness they did sometimes.

06:55.400 --> 06:59.960
However every kid knows how to bypass that, they're not dumb twats, it's an onerous

06:59.960 --> 07:04.480
complication to say the least, and riding on the wave, Burger knew exactly how to take

07:04.480 --> 07:08.540
advantage of that, she'd get the clicks, she'd get the dicks.

07:08.540 --> 07:12.100
However when your content is growing fast through the methods of provocation, it gains

07:12.100 --> 07:17.640
the attention of something equally ravenous, drama, and damn was it spicy.

07:17.640 --> 07:20.660
You see there were many commentators who took protest to the fact that her content was on

07:20.660 --> 07:24.340
YouTube, and that it was being promoted too, so they made videos on it.

07:24.340 --> 07:28.180
Now I must stress, not everyone you make a video on will gain from it, if you can deliver

07:28.180 --> 07:31.940
criticism in a damning fashion, then you can stifle someone's growth.

07:31.940 --> 07:36.420
In this instance many commentators were hoping to bring YouTube's awareness to the situation,

07:36.420 --> 07:40.840
and effectively have her removed, however in this instance the drama was a perfect storm

07:40.840 --> 07:41.880
to propel her.

07:41.880 --> 07:45.380
The criticism that many of these commentators dished out was levied from a point of view

07:45.380 --> 07:47.180
concerned with moral conduct.

07:47.180 --> 07:51.100
Now sometimes moral conduct can be fairly black and white, but the moral issue here

07:51.100 --> 07:55.860
came with indulgence, so many people responded, well Zoe's having a good time, the viewers

07:55.860 --> 07:58.380
are having a good time too, who's losing?

07:58.380 --> 08:02.900
And some of these commentators have significant overlap into the sort of demographic who enjoyed

08:02.900 --> 08:06.340
Zoe's content, so no one felt particularly guilty supporting her.

08:06.340 --> 08:10.380
She wasn't explicitly abusing anyone, she wasn't touching kids to our knowledge, and

08:10.380 --> 08:14.180
the anonymity of the donors allowed people to fill in the gaps with their most ideal

08:14.180 --> 08:17.980
scenario to morally justify the system that they were participating in.

08:17.980 --> 08:21.500
It was a smart business model that worked perfectly for her.

08:21.500 --> 08:23.460
And then there was the drama with RiceGum.

08:23.460 --> 08:28.220
This was one of the few RiceGum videos that I've ever watched, fun fact, and his acting

08:28.220 --> 08:29.220
is terrible.

08:29.220 --> 08:34.020
I mean you can tell he's not being legitimate, and it's very very transparent, and because

08:34.020 --> 08:38.020
once again the whole tone of the video was mild and light hearted, it just bolstered

08:38.020 --> 08:42.460
Zoe even more, and that's what it was meant to do, it was a good scheme by two people

08:42.460 --> 08:44.100
in the same network.

08:44.100 --> 08:47.700
And through this Zoe essentially managed to smoothly transition her content from Twitch

08:47.700 --> 08:50.380
to YouTube, maximising her success.

08:50.380 --> 08:54.220
She would also regularly make video responses and call out people herself.

08:54.220 --> 08:58.140
A lot of her arguments fell rather flat to be honest, but one thing that never got old

08:58.140 --> 09:02.100
was the fact that she could do what she wants, and if YouTube had a problem they could get

09:02.100 --> 09:05.780
rid of her themselves, which was always fairly indestructible.

09:05.780 --> 09:10.380
She gradually escalated her escapades, eventually offering news for 1 million subscribers, a

09:10.380 --> 09:12.220
goal she reached incredibly quickly.

09:12.220 --> 09:17.220
Zoe Burger was YouTube's next star, she had amassed such a huge amount of followers in

09:17.220 --> 09:20.580
no time at all, the Empire had been constructed.

09:20.580 --> 09:24.580
But what she had constructed was a house of cards, and a gust of wind was just around

09:24.580 --> 09:34.020
the corner.

09:34.020 --> 09:39.500
How can something be constructed so emphatically yet have so many holes in?

09:39.500 --> 09:44.460
Zoe Burger's glass house was just a stone's throwaway for many people ready to take her

09:44.460 --> 09:47.540
down, yet the real assailant was herself.

09:47.540 --> 09:48.540
What do I mean?

09:48.540 --> 09:50.820
Well we've got time to break it down, so why don't we?

09:50.820 --> 09:55.860
Now novelty isn't always a bad thing, however there are two key clinchers with it, two that

09:55.860 --> 09:58.380
Zoe herself could not hold onto.

09:58.380 --> 10:02.460
Firstly novelty banks on the fact that no one is doing it, and for certain talents that

10:02.460 --> 10:06.740
is fine, there are some very niche persuasions that would take excessive amounts of effort

10:06.740 --> 10:09.660
to reach any sort of distinguished level of skill at all.

10:09.660 --> 10:14.380
With all due respect to her craft, Zoe Burger's brand of shaking her ass in front of the camera

10:14.380 --> 10:19.060
was not anything exceptional, the only noteworthy element was that she was the first to mix

10:19.060 --> 10:23.220
all of these elements together, but once people know the recipe, they're gonna get cooking.

10:23.220 --> 10:26.740
And as PewDiePie's recent content on various Twitch streamers has showed, there's always

10:26.740 --> 10:30.700
an audience, and whereas Zoe was banned from the platform, many of these new females very

10:30.700 --> 10:34.300
carefully walk the line between what is acceptable, and what is not.

10:34.300 --> 10:38.760
So by even being allowed on Twitch, this new set of creators had an advantage, and so when

10:38.760 --> 10:42.900
more creators came along, and the competition intensified, it no longer became a case of

10:42.900 --> 10:46.660
who did it first, it became a case of who was doing it best.

10:46.660 --> 10:50.720
The second problem with novelty is that it can't just be a gimmick, which is what a lot

10:50.720 --> 10:55.420
of Zoe Burger's sexual content was, it was a gimmick, she was known as a person who twerked

10:55.420 --> 10:57.980
on Call of Duty streams for money, that was the hook.

10:57.980 --> 11:02.340
In one of her earlier videos she says that she's aware she doesn't have the most personality,

11:02.340 --> 11:03.940
and yes, she doesn't.

11:03.940 --> 11:08.540
And that's a problem, brief, spur of the moment trends and titles can give you a significant

11:08.540 --> 11:12.080
following, but that following won't stick around if you don't have anything to bring

11:12.080 --> 11:13.080
them back for.

11:13.080 --> 11:16.760
Unfortunately there was nothing that many people who watched Zoe Burger would come back

11:16.760 --> 11:21.360
to enjoy, and as the competition rose, and people found other streamers, the motivation

11:21.360 --> 11:25.720
to return to her content was less and less, and although it didn't have to be that way,

11:25.720 --> 11:31.680
she didn't really help herself in any situation either, and probably accelerated her downfall.

11:31.680 --> 11:35.440
You see, I've never enjoyed the you're just giving them attention argument, because even

11:35.440 --> 11:39.720
if it does bring someone some increase in attention over the short term, it can have

11:39.720 --> 11:45.160
significant effects in detracting from them long term, and Zoe Burger is a perfect example

11:45.160 --> 11:46.160
of this.

11:46.160 --> 11:47.900
She isn't very good at arguing.

11:47.900 --> 11:52.160
At first it was alright, she was arguing against people who she could definitely frame as quite

11:52.160 --> 11:57.380
imposing, and she was this defender of being able to do what she wants, that was fine.

11:57.380 --> 12:01.700
But then you had other people, such as Pyrocynical, whose videos weren't just aimless rants,

12:01.700 --> 12:04.740
they were more nuanced takes on what she might be doing wrong.

12:04.740 --> 12:09.680
Although her response may have quickly gained attention because she's responding to Pyrocynical,

12:09.680 --> 12:13.360
Pyrocynical's response video has three times the views that his original one does.

12:13.360 --> 12:17.120
And even when your whole business model is based around twerking, a bit of integrity

12:17.120 --> 12:21.600
is still important, and once the drama faded there just wasn't interest, she had been shown

12:21.600 --> 12:25.320
to be a hypocrite one too many times, and she couldn't just fall back onto the same

12:25.320 --> 12:29.800
excuses that she had before, because not everyone is going to argue whether she should or should

12:29.800 --> 12:33.720
not be on the internet, there are going to be people who take more moderate positions.

12:33.720 --> 12:37.780
The only reason that she released the response to Pyrocynical was because it would get viewed,

12:37.780 --> 12:41.240
and saying that she doesn't make the type of video multiple times doesn't change the

12:41.240 --> 12:46.020
fact that she made the video and fucked up because her line of argument was just weak.

12:46.020 --> 12:49.800
However this wasn't the end of the drama, you see we just mentioned gimmicks, and obviously

12:49.800 --> 12:54.300
when your channel is partly composed of a gimmick that has an expiry date, you gradually

12:54.300 --> 12:59.500
escalate and escalate and escalate the antics to maintain viewership, it's like a roller

12:59.500 --> 13:04.200
coaster, you extend the incline a bit further but only heighten the inevitable drop.

13:04.200 --> 13:08.820
This was represented by a situation regarding nudes, the nude offering was that escalation

13:08.820 --> 13:14.460
for Zoe Burger, she was going to give all the viewers nudes at 1 million subscribers,

13:14.460 --> 13:18.920
and she hit 1 million, and obviously in an attempt to avoid channel termination, didn't

13:18.920 --> 13:22.520
really show any nudes at all, and all the horny young lads who were subscribed to her

13:22.520 --> 13:27.640
for it experienced great disappointment. This was Zoe Burger's most prominent stunt, but

13:27.640 --> 13:31.740
at the same time it represented the beginning of the drop for that roller coaster ride,

13:31.740 --> 13:36.120
and as the subs bled and she was hit with another copyright strike, which I must clarify

13:36.120 --> 13:40.380
was for an unrelated video, she lashed out at everyone under the sun, from SS Sniper

13:40.380 --> 13:45.440
Wolf, to FaZe Clan, to Daddy Ricegum, quite clearly trying to start anything, but that

13:45.440 --> 13:48.520
ship had sailed, and Zoe was still at the port.

13:48.520 --> 13:54.180
Can you maintain a consistent state of drama? Yes, I do believe you can, but it has to be

13:54.180 --> 13:59.280
constantly adapting and evolving to the necessary circumstances, a lot of Zoe's drama was

13:59.280 --> 14:03.740
oh my god, she shakes her ass for money. It's quite two dimensional, and eventually it's

14:03.740 --> 14:08.380
a debate that you realise both sides are not going to compromise on, people become bored

14:08.380 --> 14:12.940
and move on, you can just hope YouTube is on your side, right?

14:12.940 --> 14:17.760
2017. It wasn't the best time to be any sort of R-rated YouTuber, I've mentioned

14:17.760 --> 14:21.940
him before but NerdCity made a great video documenting his findings on a study conducted

14:21.940 --> 14:26.140
by researcher CeeLo. The results showed that if your video was rated M for Mature, it was

14:26.140 --> 14:30.240
likely to significantly affect the views and promotion that it receives, this was not

14:30.240 --> 14:34.980
a friendly algorithm to someone like Zoe Burger. Now gameplay channels were already being marked

14:34.980 --> 14:40.260
with an M, and on top of that, her other offerings to these videos were pretty mature, much of

14:40.260 --> 14:44.800
her work was age restricted, and if your videos are age restricted, you know that it dies

14:44.800 --> 14:48.940
a horrible death on the algorithm, and let's face it, YouTube wouldn't want someone like

14:48.940 --> 14:51.820
Zoe Burger to be one of their most sizeable channels.

14:51.820 --> 14:55.900
And in all fairness, she did try other content where she still behaved seductively, but with

14:55.900 --> 15:00.080
a slightly more marketable vibe. However, this essentially put her in a paradox because

15:00.080 --> 15:04.560
the original appeal was how downright shameless she was, and at this point, her switching

15:04.560 --> 15:09.260
content to stuff marginally more dignified was like attempting to polish a prostitute,

15:09.260 --> 15:13.040
she either could do the more crude content and risk being punished by YouTube, or do

15:13.040 --> 15:17.460
more sophisticated works and undermine her whole appeal in the first place.

15:17.460 --> 15:23.160
2017 was not a good year to be anything on YouTube, especially Zoe Burger, and in her

15:23.160 --> 15:27.500
defence, she did anticipate that. However, with that said, although her channel wasn't

15:27.500 --> 15:31.560
on the hot streak that her original content was, there were still the odd couple of videos

15:31.560 --> 15:36.000
that seemed to do well, and although it was definitely quite turbulent, it wasn't fully

15:36.000 --> 15:41.960
dead. So what killed it? What was the nail in the Zoe Burger coffin? Let's talk about

15:41.960 --> 15:49.120
Lux.

15:49.120 --> 15:52.960
Lux was Zoe's gaming initiative that would branch beyond her, it was her all female

15:52.960 --> 15:57.480
gaming team, and it was going to reach a new demographic. Now on paper, this is not

15:57.480 --> 16:02.160
a disastrous idea, having a few extra people does create a new dynamic, and although it

16:02.160 --> 16:06.800
can sometimes water down individual personalities, I don't think personality was ever Zoe's

16:06.800 --> 16:10.760
strong point, and therefore multiplying the number of on-screen asses wasn't exactly

16:10.760 --> 16:15.100
an awful idea. This was something that Zoe clearly felt passionate about, and she was

16:15.100 --> 16:19.760
promoting it tirelessly. Many of her videos have gone just from her to this new acquired

16:19.760 --> 16:23.780
squad, the views weren't exceptional, but they were consistent, what she needed to keep

16:23.780 --> 16:27.920
going. However, many of the problems that plagued Zoe Burger on her own remained prominent

16:27.920 --> 16:32.260
on Lux, they still didn't have a huge grip on the personality, there was nothing exceptional

16:32.260 --> 16:36.600
about their gameplay, unfortunately they're just not the most skilled people. As the videos

16:36.600 --> 16:41.280
decreased in number, the views did too, and then on the 21st of December, two of the founding

16:41.280 --> 16:45.180
members announced their departure from the group. The door was closing on Zoe, she had

16:45.180 --> 16:48.920
exhausted multiple options at this point, the lone streams weren't doing the numbers,

16:48.920 --> 16:53.120
the Lux streams didn't quite carry the burden necessary, so what could she do? On the same

16:53.120 --> 16:57.140
night that the girls tweeted out about their exit, Zoe put out a video, in which she explained

16:57.140 --> 17:01.220
that she had great plans for Lux and that it wasn't over, she was going to be putting

17:01.220 --> 17:06.940
110% into it, everything, balls to the wall. And that's what we needed, in a way, we needed

17:06.940 --> 17:12.040
a balls to the wall Zoe Burger, but it's not quite what we got. On the 2nd of February

17:12.040 --> 17:17.540
2018, Zoe released her trailer for the new Lux, this one was more glamorous, higher production

17:17.540 --> 17:22.200
value, and all-round more polished. The first episode was dropped on their own dedicated

17:22.200 --> 17:33.080
channel and, shit, it was a huge bomb, and it was even worse considering the visible

17:33.080 --> 17:37.100
investment being made in it, and it's time to explain everything that went tragically

17:37.100 --> 17:40.920
wrong with this. Firstly, they should not have put it on a separate channel, that was

17:40.920 --> 17:44.760
a terrible idea, it may have been an attempt to give it its own unique branding, but it

17:44.760 --> 17:49.780
just opened it up for a new torrent, away from the protection of her retained fanbase.

17:49.780 --> 17:53.500
Any seasoned YouTuber will tell you that as soon as you have a like-dislike ratio lower

17:53.500 --> 17:57.980
than 50% then YouTube pulled the video from recommended altogether, so given the fact

17:57.980 --> 18:02.780
that these were pretty much blitzed by dislikes, it killed any prospect that it had of growth.

18:02.780 --> 18:07.260
The content itself, although not entirely incompetent, was just rather boring, it was

18:07.260 --> 18:12.860
plagued by the problem that all Zoe's content was plagued by, a lack of personality. Increasing

18:12.860 --> 18:17.520
the number of people also didn't help, given the chemistry was just rather stilted, I accept

18:17.520 --> 18:21.000
that they hadn't known each other for long when they filmed, but you have to take that

18:21.000 --> 18:25.920
naivety and turn it into something riveting, and there was nothing cinematic about it,

18:25.920 --> 18:31.000
they spent around a third of the episode in a fucking limo. Only a selection of compelling

18:31.000 --> 18:35.400
events can occur within the confinement of a limo, I was more interested in how it obtained

18:35.400 --> 18:39.680
that huge dent, and why they used an instrumental that sounded like a bargain-barrel version

18:39.680 --> 18:41.100
of an old Dennis Edwards song.

19:01.720 --> 19:05.820
In case anyone wonders how I know these things, it's because I breathe music. But anyway,

19:05.820 --> 19:09.800
back to the point, it was clearly trying to be higher in its production value than

19:09.800 --> 19:13.740
it actually was, and because of this it did not gain an identity, it didn't manage to

19:13.740 --> 19:17.860
take a direction, and therefore it could not keep viewers engaged, and that's not even

19:17.860 --> 19:22.420
the most gaping issue, and I can't believe I'm saying that. But the most considerable

19:22.420 --> 19:27.660
reason why this failed, is because it was the most visible example of how Zoe Burger

19:27.660 --> 19:31.860
lost sight of what made her popular in the first place. As I said earlier, she acknowledged

19:31.860 --> 19:36.960
that she wasn't a tour de force in personality, so the idea of basing something around their

19:36.960 --> 19:43.020
personality is insane, it's career suicide. Unfortunately, a lot of people are not interested

19:43.020 --> 19:47.280
in the plight of booty streamers, and I'm really sorry to say this because we all have

19:47.280 --> 19:51.620
our own struggles and inner demons, and we shouldn't necessarily hide them from the

19:51.620 --> 19:56.380
world, but Zoe could not sell that to an audience, and after a lot of the initial drama undermined

19:56.380 --> 20:01.300
her credibility, she was never going to present her character as compelling or even refined

20:01.300 --> 20:06.100
or legitimate. People followed Zoe for her buttocks, and I'm sorry, and although it's

20:06.100 --> 20:10.860
shallow, it's a culture that I would not agree with, but in effect that's the way it is,

20:10.860 --> 20:16.980
and Zoe was aware of that, and embraced it, she loved it for a moment, she made her bed,

20:16.980 --> 20:21.540
and she lay in it. After three episodes with diminishing returns, the second Lux group

20:21.540 --> 20:26.660
disbanded. It is fair to say that it was Zoe's worst mistake, and unfortunately it led us

20:26.660 --> 20:31.160
here today, it was a foolishly ambitious move, and I know that risk taking is sometimes a

20:31.160 --> 20:35.240
necessity to gain success, however she should've realised that the odds were stacked against

20:35.240 --> 20:39.720
her in this instance, so why on earth would she chase something so destined to fail? Well

20:39.720 --> 20:43.800
to be honest from what I've watched, it was her trying to get back in touch with the authentic

20:43.800 --> 20:48.800
element, who she really was, even though it became grossly warped, and it takes me to

20:48.800 --> 20:50.200
my final point.

20:50.200 --> 20:56.280
One of the constituents that I found myself observing fairly frequently when watching

20:56.280 --> 21:00.680
her content was how forced a lot of it was, the twerking was like a routine, personality

21:00.680 --> 21:05.320
was non-existent, nothing felt genuine, in her drama video she'd contradict herself

21:05.320 --> 21:09.440
innumerable amounts of times, the emotion seemed contrived, and it led me to the conclusion

21:09.440 --> 21:12.960
that she was either desperately lacking in self awareness, or she was running on one

21:12.960 --> 21:17.120
concept which she only knew how to handle by stretching it out further and further,

21:17.120 --> 21:20.580
and as she felt herself getting sucked into this hole, she just attempted to tighten her

21:20.580 --> 21:27.000
grip on the few handles that she had hold of, and that all imploded. But unfortunately

21:27.000 --> 21:31.440
you cannot do that forever, sometimes as creators and we're desperate, we find something

21:31.440 --> 21:35.600
that works, but then to maintain it we do it more, and more, and more, and more, and

21:35.600 --> 21:41.160
we keep hoping that we find gold and recapture the original magic that bolted us into stardom.

21:41.160 --> 21:45.700
However, time transpires and people lose their interest because you built your kingdom on

21:45.700 --> 21:50.960
rickety foundations, that's what Zoe Burger stood on, a lie, a lie that this is what she

21:50.960 --> 21:55.120
wanted, a lie that this is what she needed, and with all the drama and with all the bullshit

21:55.120 --> 22:00.120
she dug herself a deeper and deeper hole. She tried to retain what made her famous,

22:00.120 --> 22:03.720
she tried to galvanise her career through Lux, and then she tried to touch on something

22:03.720 --> 22:08.400
more bona fide, and everything just led to a dead end because the original concept that

22:08.400 --> 22:13.280
she constructed herself on was not sustainable, unfortunately in the YouTube game you either

22:13.280 --> 22:17.120
die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become irrelevant.

22:17.120 --> 22:20.840
And that's the problem with Zoe, it's the end for her, and this takes us to the Twitter

22:20.840 --> 22:25.320
post, and the ones after, that showed what we should have seen, it was a desperate act

22:25.320 --> 22:29.360
that went on for much longer than it should have. Zoe unfortunately caught herself in

22:29.360 --> 22:34.080
something that many investors would call the sunk cost fallacy, the idea that we stay invested

22:34.080 --> 22:38.520
in something based on our previous investments in the hope that it gets better, but it doesn't,

22:38.520 --> 22:42.520
but we keep doing it and doing it until we have nothing left, and we're moving back to

22:42.520 --> 22:46.920
our parent state. These things won't alleviate themselves unless we find a way to branch

22:46.920 --> 22:51.360
it out, but Zoe had worn out a lot of the appeal that many people had found in her to

22:51.360 --> 22:56.880
begin with, it was all opportunistic ass shaking, and as my previous segments have documented,

22:56.880 --> 23:00.840
that's not enough in the modern environment when you're competing with people who have

23:00.840 --> 23:05.700
advantages against you in all departments, and unfortunately although I think Zoe was

23:05.700 --> 23:10.560
willing to change, she went into various different industries that she had equally insufficient

23:10.560 --> 23:15.520
skill sets to succeed in, she turned down this bizarre road, and that's what confused

23:15.520 --> 23:20.680
me the most, it was like throwing the anchor out, on a sinking ship, even as the water

23:20.680 --> 23:25.880
reached your waistline, it was a delusion. In one video that is distinctly more realistic

23:25.880 --> 23:30.200
than others, she laments all these decisions that she's made, and for the first time, it

23:30.200 --> 23:34.160
was kinda sad, it didn't feel like she was just crying to try and emotionally appeal

23:34.160 --> 23:38.480
to the twitch gods to let her back in, it felt like she realised where she stood, and

23:38.480 --> 23:43.320
it left her empty. When we act to maintain an image, it takes its toll, especially in

23:43.320 --> 23:48.200
cases like Zoe Burgers, where there was clearly a subconscious yearning for a return to something

23:48.200 --> 23:52.780
more genuine, something more innocent, and looking back on her legacy as the twitch streamer

23:52.780 --> 23:58.320
who exploited a little more than cleavage for views, yeah, I'd be pretty disappointed

23:58.320 --> 24:02.040
too. She thought Lux could provide that sort of fresh start, but all it did was create

24:02.040 --> 24:05.860
business relationships with people who she considered friends before, which subsequently

24:05.860 --> 24:10.240
broke down the genuine elements of her life that she valued. Above all, what I've observed

24:10.240 --> 24:14.760
is that Zoe's just too impulsive with how she acts, as she says in this video, she really

24:14.760 --> 24:19.520
tries to save money but often that doesn't happen, she has a vision and chases it, and

24:19.520 --> 24:24.600
it doesn't work out, and that's how this whole thing started, Lux was not a realistic passion

24:24.600 --> 24:29.200
and it was not going to launch her, she was someone twerking on camera for the dollar,

24:29.200 --> 24:32.600
and that is fine, but she never thought about how that might change, she never thought about

24:32.600 --> 24:36.600
how to adapt to altering environments, even when she consciously acknowledged her own

24:36.600 --> 24:40.840
flaws she acted like a person in denial, hoping that the audience would somehow take

24:40.840 --> 24:44.920
to her. She thought that she could transition and escape the stigma, while forgetting that

24:44.920 --> 24:49.040
it was simultaneously the stigma that made her popular in the first place, by deserting

24:49.040 --> 24:53.360
that audience to pursue something idealistic, when she returned the audience wasn't there

24:53.360 --> 24:57.640
either, she basically dug her own grave. Zoe, you're never going to have that respect from

24:57.640 --> 25:02.360
a majority of people, I'm sorry, but that is how you popularise yourself, unfortunately

25:02.360 --> 25:06.200
Twerking is not a personality trait, it's a gimmick, and if you have nothing else to

25:06.200 --> 25:11.000
supplement that, it will become tiresome very quickly, your rise was too fast to be true,

25:11.000 --> 25:15.440
your fall too fateful to be false, and this is where I'd like to leave a message to you,

25:15.440 --> 25:16.440
the audience.

25:16.440 --> 25:21.000
If you want a career that will be known fondly, supported through times when you trend and

25:21.000 --> 25:25.040
times when you don't, if you want to pursue other careers and still want that core fanbase

25:25.040 --> 25:31.760
who may not have great interest in it, it's about respect. Zoe's whole gimmick was self-objectification,

25:31.760 --> 25:36.200
a concept inherently antithetical to the notion of respect, and whenever she tried

25:36.200 --> 25:41.360
to go deeper she came across as lousily shallow or easily debunked, this prevented her from

25:41.360 --> 25:45.080
being able to develop a character, as she was trying to base her developments off a

25:45.080 --> 25:49.200
character that even she didn't believe in, and that's such an important point, if you

25:49.200 --> 25:53.520
want to develop yourself, I think that's great, but it has to come from a genuine place, and

25:53.520 --> 25:58.160
everything about Zoe's persona was synthetic, if you want to try and develop something fake,

25:58.160 --> 26:02.920
all you do is expose how fake it truly is, people came for brainless content, you try

26:02.920 --> 26:06.560
and give it a brain and you'll just end up with some fucked Frankenstein's monster of

26:06.560 --> 26:11.080
a persona that doesn't compel anyone, because it doesn't make sense, and when you expand

26:11.080 --> 26:16.000
as much effort as Zoe did trying to make sense of it, it will inevitably fail, and that is

26:16.000 --> 26:17.000
sad.

26:17.000 --> 26:20.940
I don't think there's anything wrong with exaggerated and elaborated personas, everyone's

26:20.940 --> 26:26.000
persona is slightly different from their personality, but keep them based in reality, base them

26:26.000 --> 26:30.240
in some form of respect, any form of respect, and you will vastly increase your chances

26:30.240 --> 26:35.040
of longevity on this platform, there are often faster and easier ways to success, but it's

26:35.040 --> 26:40.040
only a matter of time before they become highly precarious, Zoe Burger is a prime example

26:40.040 --> 26:43.960
of that, she was only interesting when she was being something that she wasn't, a gimmick

26:43.960 --> 26:48.160
that was exposed when she tried to return to her roots, and has led us to this sorry

26:48.160 --> 26:49.400
situation.

26:49.400 --> 26:53.760
I hope she finds herself, but I do not think it will be on this platform, I think it's

26:53.760 --> 26:57.720
time for her to give it a break, and move on.

26:57.720 --> 26:59.040
What do you think of Zoe Burger?

26:59.040 --> 27:02.840
I'd love to hear your diagnosis, let me know, in the comments below I'd also like to give

27:02.840 --> 27:06.900
a humongous thanks to the editors who have done another great job on this, I'm going

27:06.900 --> 27:10.160
to leave their links down below and you should definitely check them out if you have the

27:10.160 --> 27:14.060
chance and send them some love, without that talent this channel would not be here today

27:14.060 --> 27:15.960
so I really can't thank them enough.

27:15.960 --> 27:19.920
I also get asked a lot what sort of content I enjoy, and I'll often retweet it on my

27:19.920 --> 27:24.320
Twitter which is at the right opinion, however I also have a group of creators who I really

27:24.320 --> 27:29.200
think have great potential, known as the NCO, and we tweet out their content on the at NCO

27:29.200 --> 27:33.360
underscore tweets, I'll leave that link in the description below and pinned comment too.

27:33.360 --> 27:36.960
You can reach me on Facebook and Discord, though I don't promote content beyond my own

27:36.960 --> 27:37.960
on there.

27:37.960 --> 27:40.760
Anyhow I'd like to thank everyone for the support of recent, it's been very impressive

27:40.760 --> 27:44.200
and it means a lot, and I look forward to chatting with all of you in the future.

27:44.200 --> 27:48.600
Until then however, I'm The Right Opinion, and I'll see you, in the next one.
