00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,940
Monday, the 7th of May, 2018, 10.09 AM EST.

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:09,480
The sun shining, the flowers blooming, the day advancing.

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:14,620
However, not everything shone, not everything bloomed, and not everything advanced.

4
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:18,120
In fact, for the world surrounding Zoe Berger, the forecast was quite adverse.

5
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:22,920
In a series of revealing tweets, she let the world know of her condition, her circumstances,

6
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,480
and her state, figuratively and literally.

7
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:29,560
The tweets indicated that the once-renowned sexual provocateur had taken a sharp nosedive

8
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:30,560
into oblivion.

9
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,100
A sad story.

10
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:36,080
But how did she meet this fate, and more importantly, why?

11
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:54,240
Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of Atwat with

12
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,600
too much free time.

13
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,160
And today, I take a look at Zoe Berger.

14
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,960
Zoe Berger is or was a Twitch and YouTube streamer.

15
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:06,080
On the surface, that sounds fairly unexceptional, but Zoe had a twist, and a few twerks too.

16
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,640
She originally started involving herself in social media around the year of 2013, while

17
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,000
she was attending university.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
That's relatable.

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,520
At least, I assume it was around then, as that was when her Twitter account was created,

20
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:19,440
and activity initiated.

21
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:23,960
But it wasn't until 2016, where she became particularly notorious amongst anyone within

22
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:27,200
the commentary sphere, for being extremely provocative with her content.

23
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:30,120
But there was a lot more going on beyond the surface.

24
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:33,880
As a Twitch streamer, she was banned four times, however, finding her feet on YouTube,

25
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,080
she hit one million in no time at all.

26
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,080
That is pretty incredible.

27
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:40,440
I remember when I first came across her, and I was almost stunned at the speed of such

28
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,440
growth.

29
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:44,760
Even with the reputation garnered being carried over from Twitch, it seems she was destined

30
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,260
to smash the platform.

31
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:49,480
After all, there's always going to be a demographic for her sort of content, right?

32
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:52,280
Zoe Berger, the face of YouTube.

33
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,440
Didn't quite happen, did it though?

34
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:58,960
In fact, as quickly as the success came, it just halted, and as of right now, she is on

35
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,920
the same subscriber count that she was on in December 2016.

36
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:06,700
Given her ascension was only in the space of a few months before then, the sudden cessation

37
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:07,700
was almost unbelievable.

38
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:11,440
Now, it's not exceptional for someone to fall as quickly as they rise, and there are

39
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,140
many scenarios in which this has occurred, but for something as consistently, well, dick-hardening

40
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:20,200
for many young whippersnappers, a stagnation seems at least slightly more difficult than

41
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,360
she made it out to be.

42
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,600
Plenty of other provocative females on the platform have been known to flaunt their physicality,

43
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,520
and they can hold onto their ground.

44
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,080
On top of that, it wasn't like she hadn't tried to branch beyond shaking her ass.

45
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,560
In fact, she had also attempted to start up her own little brand known as Lux.

46
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,600
It's clear that she invested a lot in this, and we'll investigate that more in a bit.

47
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:42,760
However, when the first generation of this little squadron exited at the end of 2017,

48
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:47,400
Zoe greeted 2018 with open arms, and vowed to give the next set of recruits all new and

49
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,760
exciting opportunities.

50
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,760
Mansion Shoot's production filming Zoe had a vision.

51
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,800
However, on the 8th of April, that came to an end with Lux devolving, and just over a

52
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,800
month later came the tweet in question, followed by numerous more tweets that represented a

53
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,480
unique turn in character from the once rather explicit streamer.

54
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,960
Where there is a rise, and there is a fall, there is an explanation.

55
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,960
For both.

56
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:11,560
I thought I'd conduct my own little inquiry into little details that led to the ascent

57
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:15,680
and subsequent descent for one of the most shameless characters on the platform.

58
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,800
Without further ado, let's get right into it.

59
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,160
If you use Twitch, you'll know that they run a pretty tight shift for a lot of their content,

60
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,520
particularly for that which may include provocation.

61
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:33,160
Provocative is one way of describing Zoe Burger's content, and one word that I'm probably going

62
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:37,840
to be using a lot today, so when she was kicked off inevitably, it was not a surprise, not

63
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,840
even to Zoe.

64
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,720
However, she did not seem too bothered.

65
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:45,160
After all, she found YouTube and an environment that perfectly fostered her meteoric rise

66
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,920
to stardom, or whatever you wanna fucking call it.

67
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,040
It seems unlikely that Zoe was the first Twitch streamer to ever be sexually provocative.

68
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,840
I'm sure there were plenty before, and there were plenty since.

69
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,560
However, she was definitely one of the first to be able to gain significant traction from

70
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,120
it, and unlike her contemporaries, there was no ambiguity about it.

71
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:06,080
She knew what she was doing when she was shaking that ass, and pulling the views.

72
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,780
I wanted to get a snapshot of her old Twitch, however for some reason the Wayback Machine

73
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:12,920
carried on telling me that all the screenshots for her channel had been shipped to another

74
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,120
castle which is fantastic.

75
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,400
Either way, I was not impressed.

76
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,440
I also wanted to be able to piece together a slightly more detailed timeline, but unfortunately

77
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:24,480
she sometimes just appeared to forget to fill in the text boxes, so her follower count was

78
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,480
often a mystery.

79
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:29,180
However, with a bit more digging, I did manage to find an old image taken before she went

80
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:33,320
viral in March 2016, showing that she had a decent amount of traction.

81
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:36,680
In fact, briefly after one of the occasions she was banned and had her account returned,

82
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,800
she reported receiving a shoutout from RiceGum of all people.

83
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:47,240
Isn't that curious?

84
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:51,280
So this inevitably gave her some groundswell, and eventually when she was kicked off Twitch

85
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,200
the fourth time, she moved to YouTube, with a significant amount of momentum she managed

86
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,400
to kickstart the channel.

87
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,560
You have a collection of highly active subs at that point, that looks great to a lot of

88
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,660
algorithmic mechanisms, so she gained and gained and gained, and it effectively snowballed.

89
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:08,040
But what did that snowball like?

90
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,040
B O O D Y

91
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,360
2016 was a strange year.

92
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:18,320
Gaming channels were in a tight spot, they hadn't effectively died like they had sometimes,

93
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,120
such as the pre-Fortnite drought, however there was a sentiment of stagnation, and they

94
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:26,360
needed a hero, someone to give it a new lease of life.

95
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,360
Zoey Burger.

96
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,920
Zoey Burger appealed to the fact that there is a significant demographic within the gaming

97
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:35,800
industry that are hormonal virgins, who jumped to the chance to watch someone juggle such

98
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,640
personality with gameplay.

99
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:42,000
Her thumbnails hit the sweet spot, and a lot of people justifiably asked why on earth she

100
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,920
was gaining any attention at all.

101
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:47,440
Why were people donating to see someone shake their ass when they could watch someone shake

102
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,880
their ass for free anywhere else?

103
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,280
That's an interesting question.

104
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:54,780
I think the idea of specific donations within the streams themselves almost gave the donor

105
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:59,800
a perverted sense of power, the fact that they had control, they were making her shake

106
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:04,560
her ass, the virtual representation of going to a strip club for them and throwing money

107
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,120
at the hookers, having someone shake their ass for them.

108
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:12,520
It was a nice little scheme that set her apart and knew how to appeal to certain psychological

109
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,000
switches in the mind.

110
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,060
Now of course this brought into question many moral challenges, with many content creators

111
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:21,480
attempting to have her channel terminated, but the lines were so blurred that it was

112
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:25,440
simply impossible to remove her from the platform, it also didn't help that a lot of people

113
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,920
were just attempting to eject her because she was busting that booty.

114
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:32,720
And if you've seen the latest music video for Tiger for example, and multiple other

115
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,480
artists within the music industry, you'll understand that if YouTube were to ban Zoe

116
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:40,280
Burger, there'd be even larger policy inconsistencies than the ones they have already.

117
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:43,780
The only deeper question is should she be shaking her ass for donations from kids who

118
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:45,740
probably aren't completely mature?

119
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:49,400
The problem is, although it's inevitable that it's happened, it's hard to establish

120
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:53,580
the age of such donors, so the best YouTube could do was age restrict the videos, which

121
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,400
in all fairness they did sometimes.

122
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:59,960
However every kid knows how to bypass that, they're not dumb twats, it's an onerous

123
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:04,480
complication to say the least, and riding on the wave, Burger knew exactly how to take

124
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:08,540
advantage of that, she'd get the clicks, she'd get the dicks.

125
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:12,100
However when your content is growing fast through the methods of provocation, it gains

126
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:17,640
the attention of something equally ravenous, drama, and damn was it spicy.

127
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:20,660
You see there were many commentators who took protest to the fact that her content was on

128
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:24,340
YouTube, and that it was being promoted too, so they made videos on it.

129
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:28,180
Now I must stress, not everyone you make a video on will gain from it, if you can deliver

130
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:31,940
criticism in a damning fashion, then you can stifle someone's growth.

131
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:36,420
In this instance many commentators were hoping to bring YouTube's awareness to the situation,

132
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:40,840
and effectively have her removed, however in this instance the drama was a perfect storm

133
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,880
to propel her.

134
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:45,380
The criticism that many of these commentators dished out was levied from a point of view

135
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:47,180
concerned with moral conduct.

136
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:51,100
Now sometimes moral conduct can be fairly black and white, but the moral issue here

137
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:55,860
came with indulgence, so many people responded, well Zoe's having a good time, the viewers

138
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:58,380
are having a good time too, who's losing?

139
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:02,900
And some of these commentators have significant overlap into the sort of demographic who enjoyed

140
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:06,340
Zoe's content, so no one felt particularly guilty supporting her.

141
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:10,380
She wasn't explicitly abusing anyone, she wasn't touching kids to our knowledge, and

142
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:14,180
the anonymity of the donors allowed people to fill in the gaps with their most ideal

143
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:17,980
scenario to morally justify the system that they were participating in.

144
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:21,500
It was a smart business model that worked perfectly for her.

145
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,460
And then there was the drama with RiceGum.

146
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:28,220
This was one of the few RiceGum videos that I've ever watched, fun fact, and his acting

147
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:29,220
is terrible.

148
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:34,020
I mean you can tell he's not being legitimate, and it's very very transparent, and because

149
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:38,020
once again the whole tone of the video was mild and light hearted, it just bolstered

150
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:42,460
Zoe even more, and that's what it was meant to do, it was a good scheme by two people

151
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:44,100
in the same network.

152
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:47,700
And through this Zoe essentially managed to smoothly transition her content from Twitch

153
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:50,380
to YouTube, maximising her success.

154
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:54,220
She would also regularly make video responses and call out people herself.

155
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:58,140
A lot of her arguments fell rather flat to be honest, but one thing that never got old

156
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:02,100
was the fact that she could do what she wants, and if YouTube had a problem they could get

157
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:05,780
rid of her themselves, which was always fairly indestructible.

158
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:10,380
She gradually escalated her escapades, eventually offering news for 1 million subscribers, a

159
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,220
goal she reached incredibly quickly.

160
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:17,220
Zoe Burger was YouTube's next star, she had amassed such a huge amount of followers in

161
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:20,580
no time at all, the Empire had been constructed.

162
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:24,580
But what she had constructed was a house of cards, and a gust of wind was just around

163
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:34,020
the corner.

164
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:39,500
How can something be constructed so emphatically yet have so many holes in?

165
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:44,460
Zoe Burger's glass house was just a stone's throwaway for many people ready to take her

166
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:47,540
down, yet the real assailant was herself.

167
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:48,540
What do I mean?

168
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,820
Well we've got time to break it down, so why don't we?

169
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:55,860
Now novelty isn't always a bad thing, however there are two key clinchers with it, two that

170
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:58,380
Zoe herself could not hold onto.

171
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:02,460
Firstly novelty banks on the fact that no one is doing it, and for certain talents that

172
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:06,740
is fine, there are some very niche persuasions that would take excessive amounts of effort

173
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:09,660
to reach any sort of distinguished level of skill at all.

174
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:14,380
With all due respect to her craft, Zoe Burger's brand of shaking her ass in front of the camera

175
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:19,060
was not anything exceptional, the only noteworthy element was that she was the first to mix

176
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:23,220
all of these elements together, but once people know the recipe, they're gonna get cooking.

177
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:26,740
And as PewDiePie's recent content on various Twitch streamers has showed, there's always

178
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:30,700
an audience, and whereas Zoe was banned from the platform, many of these new females very

179
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:34,300
carefully walk the line between what is acceptable, and what is not.

180
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:38,760
So by even being allowed on Twitch, this new set of creators had an advantage, and so when

181
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:42,900
more creators came along, and the competition intensified, it no longer became a case of

182
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:46,660
who did it first, it became a case of who was doing it best.

183
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:50,720
The second problem with novelty is that it can't just be a gimmick, which is what a lot

184
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:55,420
of Zoe Burger's sexual content was, it was a gimmick, she was known as a person who twerked

185
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:57,980
on Call of Duty streams for money, that was the hook.

186
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:02,340
In one of her earlier videos she says that she's aware she doesn't have the most personality,

187
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:03,940
and yes, she doesn't.

188
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:08,540
And that's a problem, brief, spur of the moment trends and titles can give you a significant

189
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:12,080
following, but that following won't stick around if you don't have anything to bring

190
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,080
them back for.

191
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:16,760
Unfortunately there was nothing that many people who watched Zoe Burger would come back

192
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:21,360
to enjoy, and as the competition rose, and people found other streamers, the motivation

193
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,720
to return to her content was less and less, and although it didn't have to be that way,

194
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:31,680
she didn't really help herself in any situation either, and probably accelerated her downfall.

195
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,440
You see, I've never enjoyed the you're just giving them attention argument, because even

196
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,720
if it does bring someone some increase in attention over the short term, it can have

197
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:45,160
significant effects in detracting from them long term, and Zoe Burger is a perfect example

198
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,160
of this.

199
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,900
She isn't very good at arguing.

200
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:52,160
At first it was alright, she was arguing against people who she could definitely frame as quite

201
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:57,380
imposing, and she was this defender of being able to do what she wants, that was fine.

202
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:01,700
But then you had other people, such as Pyrocynical, whose videos weren't just aimless rants,

203
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:04,740
they were more nuanced takes on what she might be doing wrong.

204
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:09,680
Although her response may have quickly gained attention because she's responding to Pyrocynical,

205
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:13,360
Pyrocynical's response video has three times the views that his original one does.

206
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,120
And even when your whole business model is based around twerking, a bit of integrity

207
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:21,600
is still important, and once the drama faded there just wasn't interest, she had been shown

208
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,320
to be a hypocrite one too many times, and she couldn't just fall back onto the same

209
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:29,800
excuses that she had before, because not everyone is going to argue whether she should or should

210
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:33,720
not be on the internet, there are going to be people who take more moderate positions.

211
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:37,780
The only reason that she released the response to Pyrocynical was because it would get viewed,

212
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:41,240
and saying that she doesn't make the type of video multiple times doesn't change the

213
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:46,020
fact that she made the video and fucked up because her line of argument was just weak.

214
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:49,800
However this wasn't the end of the drama, you see we just mentioned gimmicks, and obviously

215
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:54,300
when your channel is partly composed of a gimmick that has an expiry date, you gradually

216
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:59,500
escalate and escalate and escalate the antics to maintain viewership, it's like a roller

217
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:04,200
coaster, you extend the incline a bit further but only heighten the inevitable drop.

218
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:08,820
This was represented by a situation regarding nudes, the nude offering was that escalation

219
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:14,460
for Zoe Burger, she was going to give all the viewers nudes at 1 million subscribers,

220
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:18,920
and she hit 1 million, and obviously in an attempt to avoid channel termination, didn't

221
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:22,520
really show any nudes at all, and all the horny young lads who were subscribed to her

222
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:27,640
for it experienced great disappointment. This was Zoe Burger's most prominent stunt, but

223
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:31,740
at the same time it represented the beginning of the drop for that roller coaster ride,

224
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:36,120
and as the subs bled and she was hit with another copyright strike, which I must clarify

225
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:40,380
was for an unrelated video, she lashed out at everyone under the sun, from SS Sniper

226
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:45,440
Wolf, to FaZe Clan, to Daddy Ricegum, quite clearly trying to start anything, but that

227
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,520
ship had sailed, and Zoe was still at the port.

228
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:54,180
Can you maintain a consistent state of drama? Yes, I do believe you can, but it has to be

229
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:59,280
constantly adapting and evolving to the necessary circumstances, a lot of Zoe's drama was

230
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:03,740
oh my god, she shakes her ass for money. It's quite two dimensional, and eventually it's

231
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:08,380
a debate that you realise both sides are not going to compromise on, people become bored

232
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:12,940
and move on, you can just hope YouTube is on your side, right?

233
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:17,760
2017. It wasn't the best time to be any sort of R-rated YouTuber, I've mentioned

234
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:21,940
him before but NerdCity made a great video documenting his findings on a study conducted

235
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:26,140
by researcher CeeLo. The results showed that if your video was rated M for Mature, it was

236
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:30,240
likely to significantly affect the views and promotion that it receives, this was not

237
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,980
a friendly algorithm to someone like Zoe Burger. Now gameplay channels were already being marked

238
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:40,260
with an M, and on top of that, her other offerings to these videos were pretty mature, much of

239
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:44,800
her work was age restricted, and if your videos are age restricted, you know that it dies

240
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,940
a horrible death on the algorithm, and let's face it, YouTube wouldn't want someone like

241
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:51,820
Zoe Burger to be one of their most sizeable channels.

242
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:55,900
And in all fairness, she did try other content where she still behaved seductively, but with

243
00:14:55,900 --> 00:15:00,080
a slightly more marketable vibe. However, this essentially put her in a paradox because

244
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:04,560
the original appeal was how downright shameless she was, and at this point, her switching

245
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:09,260
content to stuff marginally more dignified was like attempting to polish a prostitute,

246
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:13,040
she either could do the more crude content and risk being punished by YouTube, or do

247
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:17,460
more sophisticated works and undermine her whole appeal in the first place.

248
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:23,160
2017 was not a good year to be anything on YouTube, especially Zoe Burger, and in her

249
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:27,500
defence, she did anticipate that. However, with that said, although her channel wasn't

250
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:31,560
on the hot streak that her original content was, there were still the odd couple of videos

251
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:36,000
that seemed to do well, and although it was definitely quite turbulent, it wasn't fully

252
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,960
dead. So what killed it? What was the nail in the Zoe Burger coffin? Let's talk about

253
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:49,120
Lux.

254
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,960
Lux was Zoe's gaming initiative that would branch beyond her, it was her all female

255
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:57,480
gaming team, and it was going to reach a new demographic. Now on paper, this is not

256
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:02,160
a disastrous idea, having a few extra people does create a new dynamic, and although it

257
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:06,800
can sometimes water down individual personalities, I don't think personality was ever Zoe's

258
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,760
strong point, and therefore multiplying the number of on-screen asses wasn't exactly

259
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:15,100
an awful idea. This was something that Zoe clearly felt passionate about, and she was

260
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:19,760
promoting it tirelessly. Many of her videos have gone just from her to this new acquired

261
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:23,780
squad, the views weren't exceptional, but they were consistent, what she needed to keep

262
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:27,920
going. However, many of the problems that plagued Zoe Burger on her own remained prominent

263
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:32,260
on Lux, they still didn't have a huge grip on the personality, there was nothing exceptional

264
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:36,600
about their gameplay, unfortunately they're just not the most skilled people. As the videos

265
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:41,280
decreased in number, the views did too, and then on the 21st of December, two of the founding

266
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:45,180
members announced their departure from the group. The door was closing on Zoe, she had

267
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:48,920
exhausted multiple options at this point, the lone streams weren't doing the numbers,

268
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:53,120
the Lux streams didn't quite carry the burden necessary, so what could she do? On the same

269
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,140
night that the girls tweeted out about their exit, Zoe put out a video, in which she explained

270
00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:01,220
that she had great plans for Lux and that it wasn't over, she was going to be putting

271
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:06,940
110% into it, everything, balls to the wall. And that's what we needed, in a way, we needed

272
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:12,040
a balls to the wall Zoe Burger, but it's not quite what we got. On the 2nd of February

273
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:17,540
2018, Zoe released her trailer for the new Lux, this one was more glamorous, higher production

274
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:22,200
value, and all-round more polished. The first episode was dropped on their own dedicated

275
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:33,080
channel and, shit, it was a huge bomb, and it was even worse considering the visible

276
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:37,100
investment being made in it, and it's time to explain everything that went tragically

277
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:40,920
wrong with this. Firstly, they should not have put it on a separate channel, that was

278
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:44,760
a terrible idea, it may have been an attempt to give it its own unique branding, but it

279
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:49,780
just opened it up for a new torrent, away from the protection of her retained fanbase.

280
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:53,500
Any seasoned YouTuber will tell you that as soon as you have a like-dislike ratio lower

281
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:57,980
than 50% then YouTube pulled the video from recommended altogether, so given the fact

282
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:02,780
that these were pretty much blitzed by dislikes, it killed any prospect that it had of growth.

283
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:07,260
The content itself, although not entirely incompetent, was just rather boring, it was

284
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:12,860
plagued by the problem that all Zoe's content was plagued by, a lack of personality. Increasing

285
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:17,520
the number of people also didn't help, given the chemistry was just rather stilted, I accept

286
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:21,000
that they hadn't known each other for long when they filmed, but you have to take that

287
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,920
naivety and turn it into something riveting, and there was nothing cinematic about it,

288
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:31,000
they spent around a third of the episode in a fucking limo. Only a selection of compelling

289
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,400
events can occur within the confinement of a limo, I was more interested in how it obtained

290
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:39,680
that huge dent, and why they used an instrumental that sounded like a bargain-barrel version

291
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,100
of an old Dennis Edwards song.

292
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:05,820
In case anyone wonders how I know these things, it's because I breathe music. But anyway,

293
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:09,800
back to the point, it was clearly trying to be higher in its production value than

294
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:13,740
it actually was, and because of this it did not gain an identity, it didn't manage to

295
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:17,860
take a direction, and therefore it could not keep viewers engaged, and that's not even

296
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:22,420
the most gaping issue, and I can't believe I'm saying that. But the most considerable

297
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:27,660
reason why this failed, is because it was the most visible example of how Zoe Burger

298
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:31,860
lost sight of what made her popular in the first place. As I said earlier, she acknowledged

299
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:36,960
that she wasn't a tour de force in personality, so the idea of basing something around their

300
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:43,020
personality is insane, it's career suicide. Unfortunately, a lot of people are not interested

301
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:47,280
in the plight of booty streamers, and I'm really sorry to say this because we all have

302
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:51,620
our own struggles and inner demons, and we shouldn't necessarily hide them from the

303
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:56,380
world, but Zoe could not sell that to an audience, and after a lot of the initial drama undermined

304
00:19:56,380 --> 00:20:01,300
her credibility, she was never going to present her character as compelling or even refined

305
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:06,100
or legitimate. People followed Zoe for her buttocks, and I'm sorry, and although it's

306
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:10,860
shallow, it's a culture that I would not agree with, but in effect that's the way it is,

307
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:16,980
and Zoe was aware of that, and embraced it, she loved it for a moment, she made her bed,

308
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:21,540
and she lay in it. After three episodes with diminishing returns, the second Lux group

309
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:26,660
disbanded. It is fair to say that it was Zoe's worst mistake, and unfortunately it led us

310
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:31,160
here today, it was a foolishly ambitious move, and I know that risk taking is sometimes a

311
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:35,240
necessity to gain success, however she should've realised that the odds were stacked against

312
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:39,720
her in this instance, so why on earth would she chase something so destined to fail? Well

313
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:43,800
to be honest from what I've watched, it was her trying to get back in touch with the authentic

314
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:48,800
element, who she really was, even though it became grossly warped, and it takes me to

315
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,200
my final point.

316
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:56,280
One of the constituents that I found myself observing fairly frequently when watching

317
00:20:56,280 --> 00:21:00,680
her content was how forced a lot of it was, the twerking was like a routine, personality

318
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:05,320
was non-existent, nothing felt genuine, in her drama video she'd contradict herself

319
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:09,440
innumerable amounts of times, the emotion seemed contrived, and it led me to the conclusion

320
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,960
that she was either desperately lacking in self awareness, or she was running on one

321
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:17,120
concept which she only knew how to handle by stretching it out further and further,

322
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:20,580
and as she felt herself getting sucked into this hole, she just attempted to tighten her

323
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:27,000
grip on the few handles that she had hold of, and that all imploded. But unfortunately

324
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,440
you cannot do that forever, sometimes as creators and we're desperate, we find something

325
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,600
that works, but then to maintain it we do it more, and more, and more, and more, and

326
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:41,160
we keep hoping that we find gold and recapture the original magic that bolted us into stardom.

327
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:45,700
However, time transpires and people lose their interest because you built your kingdom on

328
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:50,960
rickety foundations, that's what Zoe Burger stood on, a lie, a lie that this is what she

329
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:55,120
wanted, a lie that this is what she needed, and with all the drama and with all the bullshit

330
00:21:55,120 --> 00:22:00,120
she dug herself a deeper and deeper hole. She tried to retain what made her famous,

331
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:03,720
she tried to galvanise her career through Lux, and then she tried to touch on something

332
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:08,400
more bona fide, and everything just led to a dead end because the original concept that

333
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:13,280
she constructed herself on was not sustainable, unfortunately in the YouTube game you either

334
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:17,120
die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become irrelevant.

335
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:20,840
And that's the problem with Zoe, it's the end for her, and this takes us to the Twitter

336
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:25,320
post, and the ones after, that showed what we should have seen, it was a desperate act

337
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:29,360
that went on for much longer than it should have. Zoe unfortunately caught herself in

338
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:34,080
something that many investors would call the sunk cost fallacy, the idea that we stay invested

339
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:38,520
in something based on our previous investments in the hope that it gets better, but it doesn't,

340
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:42,520
but we keep doing it and doing it until we have nothing left, and we're moving back to

341
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:46,920
our parent state. These things won't alleviate themselves unless we find a way to branch

342
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:51,360
it out, but Zoe had worn out a lot of the appeal that many people had found in her to

343
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:56,880
begin with, it was all opportunistic ass shaking, and as my previous segments have documented,

344
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,840
that's not enough in the modern environment when you're competing with people who have

345
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:05,700
advantages against you in all departments, and unfortunately although I think Zoe was

346
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:10,560
willing to change, she went into various different industries that she had equally insufficient

347
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:15,520
skill sets to succeed in, she turned down this bizarre road, and that's what confused

348
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:20,680
me the most, it was like throwing the anchor out, on a sinking ship, even as the water

349
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:25,880
reached your waistline, it was a delusion. In one video that is distinctly more realistic

350
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:30,200
than others, she laments all these decisions that she's made, and for the first time, it

351
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:34,160
was kinda sad, it didn't feel like she was just crying to try and emotionally appeal

352
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:38,480
to the twitch gods to let her back in, it felt like she realised where she stood, and

353
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:43,320
it left her empty. When we act to maintain an image, it takes its toll, especially in

354
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:48,200
cases like Zoe Burgers, where there was clearly a subconscious yearning for a return to something

355
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:52,780
more genuine, something more innocent, and looking back on her legacy as the twitch streamer

356
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:58,320
who exploited a little more than cleavage for views, yeah, I'd be pretty disappointed

357
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:02,040
too. She thought Lux could provide that sort of fresh start, but all it did was create

358
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:05,860
business relationships with people who she considered friends before, which subsequently

359
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:10,240
broke down the genuine elements of her life that she valued. Above all, what I've observed

360
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,760
is that Zoe's just too impulsive with how she acts, as she says in this video, she really

361
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:19,520
tries to save money but often that doesn't happen, she has a vision and chases it, and

362
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:24,600
it doesn't work out, and that's how this whole thing started, Lux was not a realistic passion

363
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:29,200
and it was not going to launch her, she was someone twerking on camera for the dollar,

364
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,600
and that is fine, but she never thought about how that might change, she never thought about

365
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:36,600
how to adapt to altering environments, even when she consciously acknowledged her own

366
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:40,840
flaws she acted like a person in denial, hoping that the audience would somehow take

367
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:44,920
to her. She thought that she could transition and escape the stigma, while forgetting that

368
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:49,040
it was simultaneously the stigma that made her popular in the first place, by deserting

369
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:53,360
that audience to pursue something idealistic, when she returned the audience wasn't there

370
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:57,640
either, she basically dug her own grave. Zoe, you're never going to have that respect from

371
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:02,360
a majority of people, I'm sorry, but that is how you popularise yourself, unfortunately

372
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:06,200
Twerking is not a personality trait, it's a gimmick, and if you have nothing else to

373
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:11,000
supplement that, it will become tiresome very quickly, your rise was too fast to be true,

374
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,440
your fall too fateful to be false, and this is where I'd like to leave a message to you,

375
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,440
the audience.

376
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:21,000
If you want a career that will be known fondly, supported through times when you trend and

377
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,040
times when you don't, if you want to pursue other careers and still want that core fanbase

378
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:31,760
who may not have great interest in it, it's about respect. Zoe's whole gimmick was self-objectification,

379
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:36,200
a concept inherently antithetical to the notion of respect, and whenever she tried

380
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:41,360
to go deeper she came across as lousily shallow or easily debunked, this prevented her from

381
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:45,080
being able to develop a character, as she was trying to base her developments off a

382
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:49,200
character that even she didn't believe in, and that's such an important point, if you

383
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:53,520
want to develop yourself, I think that's great, but it has to come from a genuine place, and

384
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:58,160
everything about Zoe's persona was synthetic, if you want to try and develop something fake,

385
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:02,920
all you do is expose how fake it truly is, people came for brainless content, you try

386
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:06,560
and give it a brain and you'll just end up with some fucked Frankenstein's monster of

387
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:11,080
a persona that doesn't compel anyone, because it doesn't make sense, and when you expand

388
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:16,000
as much effort as Zoe did trying to make sense of it, it will inevitably fail, and that is

389
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
sad.

390
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,940
I don't think there's anything wrong with exaggerated and elaborated personas, everyone's

391
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:26,000
persona is slightly different from their personality, but keep them based in reality, base them

392
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,240
in some form of respect, any form of respect, and you will vastly increase your chances

393
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:35,040
of longevity on this platform, there are often faster and easier ways to success, but it's

394
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:40,040
only a matter of time before they become highly precarious, Zoe Burger is a prime example

395
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:43,960
of that, she was only interesting when she was being something that she wasn't, a gimmick

396
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:48,160
that was exposed when she tried to return to her roots, and has led us to this sorry

397
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,400
situation.

398
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:53,760
I hope she finds herself, but I do not think it will be on this platform, I think it's

399
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:57,720
time for her to give it a break, and move on.

400
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,040
What do you think of Zoe Burger?

401
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:02,840
I'd love to hear your diagnosis, let me know, in the comments below I'd also like to give

402
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:06,900
a humongous thanks to the editors who have done another great job on this, I'm going

403
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:10,160
to leave their links down below and you should definitely check them out if you have the

404
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:14,060
chance and send them some love, without that talent this channel would not be here today

405
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:15,960
so I really can't thank them enough.

406
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:19,920
I also get asked a lot what sort of content I enjoy, and I'll often retweet it on my

407
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:24,320
Twitter which is at the right opinion, however I also have a group of creators who I really

408
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:29,200
think have great potential, known as the NCO, and we tweet out their content on the at NCO

409
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:33,360
underscore tweets, I'll leave that link in the description below and pinned comment too.

410
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,960
You can reach me on Facebook and Discord, though I don't promote content beyond my own

411
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:37,960
on there.

412
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:40,760
Anyhow I'd like to thank everyone for the support of recent, it's been very impressive

413
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:44,200
and it means a lot, and I look forward to chatting with all of you in the future.

414
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:48,600
Until then however, I'm The Right Opinion, and I'll see you, in the next one.
