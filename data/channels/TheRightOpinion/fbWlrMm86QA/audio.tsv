0	3040	I don't think there's anyone quite like H3 on the platform.
10140	16860	That's equally a blessing and a curse, and today we shall investigate exactly why.
25640	29640	Hello ladies and gentlemen, welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time.
30160	31360	I think it doesn't.
31360	34000	And today we talk about H3H3 Productions.
34000	38160	H3H3 is the YouTube pair comprising of couple Ethan and Hila Klein.
38160	43520	They're pretty damn well known, there are loads of things that even people not particularly cultured with the internet will be familiar with,
43520	45400	whether it was Matt Hoss or VapeNation.
45400	50280	They understandably have an overarching impact on YouTube past and present, that can never be taken away.
50280	56720	However, there are a lot of narratives being drummed up right now, and to understand a lot of what I'm going to be discussing today, we have to go back in time.
56760	61480	Now, the H3 account was created in 2011, on the 29th of April to be specific,
61480	65080	originally made by Ethan and Hila to help Hila with her college project.
65080	70560	However, due to my work on the Wayback Machine, it appears they didn't start uploading properly until 2013.
70560	76600	This isn't something I can confirm, but we can see that approaching the end of the year, they had around just shy of 2000 subscribers,
76600	82640	a modest but not insignificant amount, especially considering at the time one of their other videos had over 200,000 views.
82640	89840	What was the main source of these views at the time? Well, it appears to be mostly these EXE videos.
89840	93840	The first real banger was Warm It Up, which really is a bonafide classic at this point.
93840	99640	Most of these captured the very minute, seemingly irrelevant moments of an interaction, often by an eccentric,
99640	105960	and put emphasis on them, almost exaggerating them more minor quirks, making them either mesmerizing or amusing.
105960	111160	They still practice other types of video in this time span, and had videos that focused more on their own personalities,
111160	114800	mostly Ethan at this point, who was like everyone's favourite creepy uncle.
114800	119240	Not that I'm endorsing creepy uncles, of course, I wouldn't leave them alone with the kids, but my point stands regardless.
119240	125240	H3 was creating an identity for themselves, and this finally began to snowball towards the end of 2014,
125240	131800	as they moved over to H3 reaction videos, which intertwined their creativity as editors and their slightly off-kilter humour.
131800	134720	It worked for them, and they experienced incremental success through it.
134720	137600	All of these videos have kind of withstood the test of time,
137600	142960	and the fact that many of their old reaction videos still perform relatively well with the algorithm is a testament to their appeal.
142960	148440	Given how well many of them still perform, it would be easy to deceive yourself that you may have discovered them later than everyone else.
148440	150360	I definitely fell foul to that mentality.
150360	153360	I looked at their view count on these videos initially and thought to myself,
153360	155680	wow, how did I not come across these guys sooner?
155680	159520	But I was introduced to them by my friend when he showed me how to clean your gamer gear.
159520	163800	I think I must have subscribed to them between one and one and a half million at some point.
163800	168520	I was definitely a sucker for the videos that place more emphasis on the editing, rather than the skits.
168520	171040	And the skits definitely had their place, without a doubt.
171040	175800	But for me, YouTube comedy needs to be high energy and sort of unexpected to get me chuckling properly.
175800	177560	Just my personal taste.
177560	182120	I think another really important aspect of these videos was that they introduced a somewhat moral standpoint.
182120	185600	Although it was often shrouded in large amounts of humour, which is expected,
185600	190240	you also had the feeling that with videos like the Pranksters, they were challenging YouTube in promoting them,
190240	192880	and challenging the Pranksters in creating this content.
192880	196920	Although this was regularly mixed in with other videos that didn't really have any deeper meaning,
196920	198240	rather than funny memes.
198240	201200	And they did create some funny memes, so can't hate them for that.
201200	205360	This definitely gave them the foundations to be a somewhat moral voice on YouTube, however.
205360	210080	And over the years, they would gradually become more involved in the specific controversies surrounding the platform,
210080	211840	and how they conducted themselves.
211840	218000	Many creators typically avoid making separate videos to necessarily talk shit about YouTube guidelines or initiatives,
218000	220360	and with creators like myself, I understand why.
220360	223880	However, the format that H3 followed allowed them to branch out,
223880	230080	and led them to more directed videos on the Fine Bros, SoFloAntonio, and of course, the infamous Now Removed Leafy video.
230080	235160	Now as noted, not all of these videos were without their flaws, and he has subsequently retracted some of his statements.
235160	241080	What a lot of people appreciated about these videos is that they were done in a way that sought the betterment of YouTube as a domain,
241080	242520	and I can respect that.
242520	246680	On top of this, with these serious videos, they still intertwine some of their personal humour,
246680	249880	and that made it a lot less of a tonal shift from their standard content.
249880	253400	Although it definitely existed on a spectrum, but still, it was them.
253400	258120	And that's why I think sometimes serious videos from a creator out of nowhere can lose the personality.
258120	261080	I have to admit, at some point, I kinda switched off from their channel,
261080	264880	but not because their content was going in a bad direction necessarily,
264880	269360	it was just moving in a style that I personally didn't find as funny, and that happens quite a lot for me.
269360	274640	Channels evolve, that's natural, sometimes they'll evolve into your taste, and sometimes they'll evolve away from your taste.
274680	281200	The fact that they turned to content that wasn't obscenely awkward or bad anymore, but more just popular, was understandable.
281200	282240	Just not for me.
282240	285320	However, I did still follow them when they covered more controversies,
285320	291120	because they were one of the larger YouTubers who was prepared to stand up for YouTube values, and the viewer alike.
291120	294640	Some people will say that they were self-interested, and that may or may not be true,
294640	299280	but at the end of the day, a lot of their rhetoric was very pro-creator, and I'm glad he's done that.
299320	302920	However, still, all of this was overshadowed by the Matt Hoss situation,
302920	306800	which, at this point, I shouldn't have to explain, but I will, just in case my parents are watching.
306800	311760	H3 made a video reacting to Matt Hoss, this was uploaded onto their second channel, Ethan and Hila.
311760	317440	Matt Hoss got his knickers in a twist, tried to take Ethan and Hila to court over copyright infringement and defamation of character,
317440	321880	the future of YouTube depended on the outcome, and massive XL, they won the big fuck-off case,
321880	326120	and Matt Hoss went into his shell, never to be heard of again. Well, I hope not at least.
326120	330920	This is essentially the history necessary to understand what is facing down Ethan and Hila today,
330920	334960	because recently, they have been the subjects of some fairly extensive criticism,
334960	341400	and it's not like this has never happened before, H3 has definitely been under the spotlight in the past for some narratives that they've created,
341400	345480	and have had their feuds and run-ins where they've come off looking slightly worse for wear.
345480	351360	However, this newest drama seems to have created a narrative about H3, one that is a lot deeper than just,
351360	356200	they got this point wrong, so I think without further ado, we've got some unboxing to participate in.
356200	361600	Are you ready? No? Well too bad, we're doing it anyway.
361600	369200	You see, everything I've documented up to now shows a gradual evolution, in a direction that you can completely understand why they've chosen,
369200	375120	and they really established themselves as individuals online through that, and that's not an easy thing to do, so fair play to them.
375160	381440	So when you've grown an audience like that, and given yourselves iconic personas, it only seems natural to branch out further.
381440	385960	This is what they did with the H3 podcast, the H3 podcast really is a stellar idea,
385960	395400	you take two very well-networked and seemingly amiable individuals, and you put them amongst a load of other popular YouTubers and celebrities who people are always interested to hear about.
395400	400360	For H3, it was another step in their evolution as creators, so they're not necessarily left behind,
400360	406120	it's a sort of well that shouldn't exactly run dry for a very long time, and so it seems like a reasonable extension,
406120	411800	but it definitely did create new challenges for Ethan and Hila, it created this environment that puts them amongst other people,
411800	417320	which sounds weird in a way, you know, that's not a huge challenge, but Ethan and Hila don't have dominating personalities,
417320	421160	which leads us to our first incident that we're going to address today, Bill Burr.
421160	427160	Bill Burr is a comedian, actor, and many more occupations relating to the media, he is also quite an assertive person,
427160	432280	and when he went on H3's podcast, whereas Ethan often tries to bring the energy down to his level a bit,
432280	438520	Bill Burr did completely opposite, and ended up trying to drag H3 up to his level, and completely out of their comfort zone.
438520	444600	What this led to was Bill Burr being too quick on the draw for Ethan, and Ethan typically struggling to contribute to the conversation.
444600	448280	...my dog, so I would say, on some level, he must've known.
448280	450760	Yeah, you're a really cynical guy, man.
450760	453080	I thought you were down, I thought you were gonna be down.
453080	455080	That is a lot for me to say that.
455080	459560	I thought you were gonna be down, but apparently I'm cynical even to Bill Burr, shit.
459560	462840	And all the commenters were certainly by no means happy about this.
462840	468760	This also led to a lot of people trying to draw narratives to Ethan's mental health state, which is something that we will address very soon,
468760	472200	but I also think as an idea, it just represented a step too far for him.
472200	476760	To me, Bill Burr and H3 are just not in the same league when it comes to this sort of interaction.
476760	483160	Some of these comedians are just so used to thinking spontaneously that they're constantly outmaneuvering the social situations they're placed in,
483160	486840	particularly when they're dealing with YouTubers, because YouTubers are unique in a way.
486840	491160	They may be funny, but they may not be cut out for every situation like many other celebrities.
491160	497240	Another example of this was when Norm Macdonald covered the red carpet interviews at the YouTube Big Live Comedy Show.
497240	502600	I'm not sure why he was there, I think it's very possible that he just wanted to sit down somewhere and saw an enticing couch,
502600	508200	but he was there, and the other co-hosts were absolutely steamrolled by him and his tour de force of personality.
508200	514280	It does seem to be something that a few of these people have, so I don't necessarily put this awkwardness down to just Ethan,
514280	516840	although he should have anticipated it a lot better.
516840	520840	With every development in the past, they built off their already existing foundations.
520840	525560	They made the EXE videos, then they integrated the EXE style into their reaction commentary,
525560	530920	and then integrated the reaction commentary into more trending topics, and you can see that there was a cohesive direction.
530920	536280	The H3 Podcast is definitely a more ambitious move, but they've reached this point where they could kind of do anything.
536280	541000	You see, with the Matt Hoss situation, it kind of immortalised Ethan and Hila, regardless of what happened.
541000	546280	An event with such huge implications not just gave H3 a reputation that cemented themselves,
546280	549240	even as people who may not be the most followed channel on the platform.
549240	554840	Their presence is undeniable. However, one would beckon the question, is being immortalised always a good thing?
554840	560520	As the ironically immortalised idiom goes, you either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.
560520	566040	And although I do believe the sentiment behind that phrase is slightly exaggerated, there is still an element of truth to it.
566040	569560	So the question then becomes, are we reaching that stage?
569560	574120	If Matt Hoss hadn't happened necessarily, if they weren't immortal, would the content carry them?
574120	578920	It's a hard question, but for me, I think it is yet, though probably to a lesser extent.
578920	584440	Generally, from what I've observed, although the new content is not necessarily my cup of tea, and the podcast probably isn't either,
584440	588280	and they're by no means experiencing the level of longevity on their videos.
588280	594360	You know, you can look at the statistics, and they're not necessarily bringing people back or getting into the recommended like the older videos do.
594360	599000	They nonetheless still have a very committed set of viewers who I don't think would have necessarily deserted them,
599000	601800	even without the level of controversy that they've been blessed with.
601800	607800	Even when their credibility has been arguably undermined, such as the situation with PewDiePie, people have still stood by them.
607800	612680	However, I do think the fact that they are more cemented than other channels will wear them out with some viewers,
612680	618280	and also some commentators, which is probably why there are more people than normal that are out criticizing them this time,
618280	621400	even though they haven't necessarily committed any huge wrongdoing.
621400	627080	Some people may just be reaching a stage of inertia for H3, but as said, I don't think that's the whole story.
627080	629000	I do think they would still be going strong.
629000	633960	So I'm gonna reverse the formula and say that the persistent fame hasn't necessarily been a bad thing for their fans,
633960	637480	but it has been a bad thing for them, and that's the thing with Bill Burr.
637480	641640	After watching the podcast, I don't think there was anything particularly bad about it.
641640	643400	It was just a perfect storm, really.
643400	648120	A slightly subdued Ethan trying to keep up with Bill Burr, who was just absolutely dominating it,
648120	651240	and it just made for a rather stilted, awkward interview.
651240	658360	The H3 podcast is a far cry from their previous content, because it represents a much more down-to-earth version of both Ethan and Hila,
658360	659640	and at times, that's fine.
659640	663800	Seeing the genuine side of a content creator helps humanize the connection with the audience,
663800	670200	but equally, it means that there is no editing to protect them, no quick upload to drop which may prevent people from asking questions.
670200	673880	Whatever they sit down and do, they have to do for a significant amount of time.
673880	677400	It drains you, even though in some ways, it might seem like less work.
677400	681320	If you're on a bad day and the celeb turns up, a facade can be hard to maintain.
681320	685720	And likewise, this is why people began to question if Ethan was entirely alright.
685720	689720	You know, you're doing something like this fairly consistently, it can be a drain.
689720	696280	It's like every idea that has spawned out of the H3 machine, and yet, I think it's so much easier to pick it apart when it goes wrong,
696280	697720	and that's what people did.
697720	704440	As mentioned earlier, there were plenty of people commenting about the state of Ethan, and questioning if he was completely happy as a person.
704440	711640	I think Ethan's been through these motions before, but it was more revealing this time round, and to get the confirmation, we need to look to his main channel.
712360	718280	H3 typically has an upload schedule, maybe a video every couple weeks, maybe a video every week.
718280	724680	This can fluctuate, but up until around 4 months ago, that was how it was structured, and then they just stopped uploading altogether.
724680	731960	A complete halt, and then after 3 months, they returned, to a huge fanfare, with an advert for their new game.
731960	739720	This understandably annoyed a lot of people, people are craving your content, and you return, give people the expectation, and then it's just some advert.
739720	745400	People will inevitably be annoyed, so in response to the backlash, they made a video addressing what has been going on,
745400	747160	Ethan noting that he was, quote,
747160	756280	Now obviously, Ela's loss is extremely tragic, and that cannot be undermined, but I wanted to address Ethan's points.
756280	763800	Now, although it's reasonable criticism to say that Ethan branding himself as actually depressed, without any additional evidence, could be perceived as a tad dodgy.
763800	768920	In this instance, we're going to assume that he's telling the truth, as I do feel that judging by his halts and uploads,
768920	774920	it must stem from some sort of lack of motivation, and a reasonable explanation of that is depression in this instance.
774920	777800	And I don't think he has a reason to lie, so I'm not going to knock it.
777800	784520	I think this is a likely case they continued the podcast for money, I do not deny that, at least as partly the reason.
784520	792440	Equally though, I think it's a fallacy to then apply the reverse of that, and say they stopped uploading on their main channel for money, they were doing it in the worst of times.
792440	799400	But with regards to it, I think there are a lot of factors that have led to this point, because arguably, they've had harder times, and made it through.
799400	802280	I think one of the defining points was the Matt Hoss situation.
802280	811000	The Matt Hoss situation in many ways was very momentous for H3, as mentioned earlier, however, there are two elements that I really think made this situation play a part in their latest burnout.
811000	820040	Firstly, the intense burden, no matter what happened, they couldn't just stop, they had a huge responsibility to carry the future of a lot of careers, that wasn't going to wait up.
820040	829320	The Matt Hoss situation was incredibly tense, because although we all almost kinda knew it was fair use, having a court of more senior citizens who may not be in touch with how the internet works,
829400	842440	it's so unpredictable, and it could have gone either way, and even though they had overwhelming support, they couldn't just stop paying attention to it, it was like revising for a test, but on a ridiculously broad subject, and you don't know the topics the questions are going to be on.
842440	850840	On top of this, I think the fact that the Matt Hoss incident was, in a way, so momentous, that once H3 had triumphed over him, it was hard to really proceed from there.
850840	858440	What do I mean? Well, this argument comes from observation. Well, typically, as humans, it seems we're focused on a narrative, a progression.
858440	865640	Going from strength to strength, and I think that's particularly the case with YouTubers, YouTube is a market where we always like the feeling of going forward.
865640	873160	Matt Hoss represents a huge step forward for us really as creators, but equally, I can see it suddenly subjuring their lives afterwards.
873160	887880	No longer do they have this constant threat to be aware of, and as that melted away, suddenly there was just a hole where that commitment used to be, which may be what provoked Ethan's depression, just the absence of something that used to be there, even if that thing that was there was pure chaos.
887880	892520	Another problem I can see contributing to this is the whole progression of reaction commentary itself.
892520	900440	I spoke at the start about what H3 used to do, and in a way, their brand of reaction commentary was kind of unique in their style and their demeanor.
900440	911000	However, as documented, like creators, they evolved. Their first evolution was arguably their most iconic, as it took two separate elements of their channel and put them together and created the H3 reaction video.
911000	920280	That tag in the video title is not just any old tag, it's an identity, and H3 reaction video is a reaction video like no other. It really is them.
920280	928840	However, like every type of video, you either become tired and need to up the ante to keep yourself creatively stimulated, or you're threatened with extinction due to the landscape changing.
928840	935880	And although in many ways the H3 reaction videos are timeless, there comes a point where you just can't quite recapture that magic in the way that you used to.
935880	945560	Another really iconic example of this is Shmoyoho. The Bed Intruder song is absolutely a classic, but it's something that could only work to the maximum in that miniature zeitgeist.
945560	950760	H3 reaction videos could not go on forever, no matter how fantastic they were in the moment.
950760	959080	However, moving away from that mold is a more general approach, and although they still had their quirks, it felt with every evolution they kind of moved away from what defined them.
959080	965080	At first, their move to topics kind of had more moral weight, and that kind of shielded it, even when they were still reacting.
965080	970440	And their involvement in YouTube drama as voices of authority meant that many people were distracted on those issues.
970440	974600	YouTube drama isn't always great to be a part of, but it is often stimulating.
974600	983080	Reaction commentary, however, is arguably at its least dramatic point in ages. A lot of the videos are fairly relaxed and inconsequential in their messages,
983080	991000	and in the videos they're no longer commenting on some corny production value or eccentric host, the real draw is some unhinged individual on Dr. Phil.
991000	999000	It's not the same environment, and it's just not quite as fun to comment on. Eventually, you alienate yourself from what identified you as a creator.
999000	1006360	I feel that reaction commentary is at a bit of an ultimatum at this moment. H3 could probably make some content, they've given themselves a broad enough base to build off.
1006360	1010440	However, they want to do something different, like this podcast. I can't blame them.
1010440	1017080	And that's the thing, reaction commentary just isn't going anywhere. It no longer necessarily appeals to the core talents of Ethan and Hila.
1017080	1024760	Once again, there'll always be something signature that no one can deny, but you can tell that with every evolution, they've kind of moved away from what they started with.
1024760	1031800	And although it's important to evolve to keep up, and sometimes just because you've become bored with your old style, you might realize that the content might not just do it for you.
1031800	1038360	It might become something that you no longer have that passion for. And in effect, that's probably why Ethan and Hila needed a break,
1038360	1045320	because it just felt like they were running on a bare-bones reaction formula, rather than the little intricacies of what set themselves apart in the first place.
1045320	1052440	You have to make content that you're passionate about, and so more importantly, when Ethan talks about a break that he needed to reassess his content,
1052440	1060280	I think that's completely understandable. He needs something more idiosyncratic to who they are as people, because in a way, that's what set H3 apart.
1060280	1070760	And I think in the last few months, it's become harder to stay in touch with that. At the end of the day, content doesn't just have to satisfy your fans, it has to satisfy you as well, and that's what's been lacking.
1070760	1080120	As said earlier, I think H3 will still be successful if they carry on creating content, all drama aside, so I really think it must come down to a problem between them as creators,
1080120	1085720	and I think they've reached a dead end in that way. But how do they escape that? Well, let's talk about it.
1091720	1098600	Due to these videos taking their time, by the time that this video is out, Ethan and Hila may have uploaded a new video to their channel.
1098600	1107640	They may be alive and kicking, and if so, that's a good thing. However, I hope the negative backlash doesn't cause them to rush their next upload, because it really could be a defining one at this point.
1107640	1116840	Their channel's been fairly off the radar for a few months, and now it's kind of come back in a way that's hyping up their next upload with an air of tension around it almost, they'll need to make it good.
1116840	1127560	I think the problem is, with every dead end, it's hard to know exactly what to do. Now, this doesn't mean they can't reverse these situations, but they need to find a new formula that works for them as much as it does for the audience.
1127560	1137080	With regards to the H3 podcast, I still think they have the capability to do a good job, they just need to avoid biting off more than they can chew, and definitely plan around their own priorities.
1137080	1151880	The thing about the podcast is that it doesn't really need to evolve necessarily, a few tweaks here and there perhaps, but overall, podcasts are the sort of thing that really come down to interaction between human beings, and if you have guests on that kind of throw the tone up and down a bit, it should keep its subsistence.
1151880	1160200	Once again, like everything, it probably wouldn't last forever, but it definitely has a better shelf life than other types of content that typically asks for more audience engagement.
1160200	1176520	With that said, doing podcasts can be a tiresome occupation, and even though I understand that you're booking people and you have to stick to a schedule, try to avoid the excitement of having a famous person on, overshadowing the fact that you may not be in the best place to host that person, you have to be on form to handle someone as commanding as Bill Burr.
1176520	1194760	I think that's what irked people, on one hand, you had the H3 podcast, which H3 was kind of forcing himself through, and yet on the channel, he'd made the decision to withdraw, and the H3 channel is arguably more important to people, and on paper, it's easier to sit down and record yourself talking to someone, in comparison to having to create content on the H3 channel.
1194760	1203240	However, the cracks show just as easily if you're not feeling it, and to be honest, given H3's volatile YouTube journey, I can understand why sometimes they're not feeling it.
1203240	1206680	Uh, look around, you can see the boxes here, we're being evicted.
1206680	1211240	We're moving in with my parents-in-law's house, that's our new apartment. We're moving into our new apartment there.
1211240	1220440	Aside from that, I'm getting a lot of requests and complaints, people saying that my videos are really boring, people saying that I should put a little more effort into my videos to not be so lazy.
1220440	1227240	I really wish that I could maybe find a little time, do a little writing, you know, make up some funny videos, haha.
1227240	1232040	Well, I don't have time. Yeah, I don't have that much time, guys.
1236040	1254440	H3 fans are a dedicated lot, any commentator knows that. They've provided a high commitment to the channel through very tough times, through the Matt Hoss era.
1254440	1268680	Through the controversies that to some level, they receive pretty hard-hitting criticism from. I don't think they're not understanding though, it's just when you have situations where you come back out of nowhere with the ballgame, even if it was something that was out of your hands to an extent, it was just rather foolish.
1268680	1278920	So now a load of commentators are kind of capitalising on that sentiment of discontent, that flavour of inertia that may linger in some viewer's mouths, and trying to create a narrative that H3 isn't what it used to be.
1278920	1291640	And you know what? That may be true, H3 isn't what it used to be, but I don't think it could be. I think to an extent that original content was not just defined by its production and its presentation, it was defined by its moment, and that moment has passed.
1291640	1299960	And if there's one thing that I think the Matt Hoss situation did, was give them a spell where they were really invincible because they represented something greater than just content.
1299960	1312600	So we will be the first client of this account that will be known as the Fair Use Protection Account, also known as FUPA. The FUPA continues to grow, the FUPA shall protect all of us.
1312600	1321080	And now we've finally reached the stage where that's worn off, and some people are saying, oh wow, this isn't what it used to be. But it hasn't been that way for a while, even before the hiatus.
1321080	1343640	Go back and watch those videos, and those videos are good, well made, entertaining, but they're not H3 reaction videos, they're what H3 viewed as an appropriate route to take, and now they're clearly reaching a stage where they question that, and that's because the landscape of reaction commentary has changed so much, and they do stand out amongst the pack as unique creators, but they still need to do something that feels like a progression for them.
1343640	1357640	And they've done a lot, how do you do more? The H3 podcast was something more, but it's not necessarily completely for every single fan, and as creators, it didn't give them that necessary progression, and one thing I found is that some of us can never truly be satisfied.
1357640	1372840	You see something, you have a goal, you want it, you work towards it, you achieve it, and then there's this rush, and after a bit you realise that nothing's really changed, and as the initial excitement wears off and the dust settles, everything becomes routine again, your life becomes a cycle, that's the case with anything.
1372840	1387080	I think that's why a lot of people do YouTube in the first place, to break that cycle, but if we don't know what to do or where to go, we can easily return to that cycle, and as psychological studies show, a lot of us have a base mood that we return to regardless of whether we've had a good or bad day,
1387080	1398280	so if H3's in a place that's not too great, then I can sympathise with his position and probably understand why, you need to keep throwing new ingredients into the frying pan, but what happens when the cupboard is empty?
1398360	1412600	Generally, I like H3, I don't think they're perfect, and they definitely warrant criticism from time to time, I mean, hell, I may even criticise them in the future, but they're human, and that's okay, and they do stand up for a vision of YouTube, which is a vision shared by creators across the spectrum,
1412600	1423560	and although it may be quieter right now, you don't know what's around the corner, and they may be really important in voicing that too, so I'm sure they'll have their time again at the forefront of the platform, because they do have a broad enough net,
1423560	1434360	but unfortunately, it's just a bit of a drought at the moment, and they're probably feeling the heat, I hope they feel better soon, and I hope that they start creating content that they and their fans can receive a mutual benefit out of,
1434360	1447480	because at the end of the day, that's why many of us came to YouTube in the first place, anyhow, another spicy video, another fun time I'd say, I'd love to hear your thoughts on this, I get a lot of mixed opinions on Ethan and Hila,
1447480	1459400	and this whole situation just kinda threw a new shadow over it, so I wanna see what everyone thinks, and I would love to hear the feedback, I wanna give a big shoutout to my editors, if you can, I'm going to leave their links in the pinned comment below,
1459400	1471000	I'd really appreciate if you go and check them out, maybe drop them some love, they do a great job, and it really does show, and I think they definitely deserve support for it, also if you wanna reach me on Twitter, my Twitter is at TheRightOpinion,
1471000	1484200	sometimes I respond to comments, but other times I don't, so if you wanna talk to me, that's the best way, I do have open DMs, you wanna reach me on Facebook, you can, I'm on there too, on Discord as well, I've been a bit more active recently, once again it's all about balancing time,
1484200	1495640	anyhow, I don't think I have too much else to say, thanks for all the support as always, hope you guys are having a lovely day, and I hope my video has helped with that, however, until then, I'm The Right Opinion, and I'll see you in the next one.
1501000	1519000	Thanks for watching, and I'll see you in the next one.
