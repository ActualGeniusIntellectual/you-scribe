0	23900	That goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills because
23900	30100	that challenge is one that we're willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone,
30100	32100	and one we intend to win.
42100	49100	However difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at.
49100	57100	Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Right of Human, the hope of HVAC in too much of your time.
65100	71100	Try to make sense of what you see and wonder about what makes the universe exist.
80100	90100	The struggle and the progress, the times we were told that we can't, the people who pressed on with that, yes we can.
90100	111100	Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time.
111100	115100	I'm in a transitional period with my content and I hoped that I would have something else ready today,
115100	119100	however that has been delayed as I underestimated how much work that would actually take.
119100	124100	So today I provide you with an alternative video, a theory that was fluttering around in my mind,
124100	128100	and even if it's not entirely applicable by the time it's released, I hope you take something away from it.
128100	133100	There is one certainty with YouTube, and any media outlet are that, that there will always be news,
133100	136100	whether it's a rat feud, a boxing match, or a dead body.
136100	139100	There is no escaping it, and we as viewers want to know what's going on,
139100	143100	but we also want to cut the crap and have the information that matters fed to us.
143100	145100	We're busy people, we have lives.
145100	150100	When looking for ways to have this information planted into our minds, we may turn towards news channels,
150100	154100	like Drama Alert or Scarce, on the other hand we might look for more thoughtful responses,
154100	157100	such as that found in Colossalist Crazy or The Random Shark.
157100	163100	Now both of these stars have advantages and disadvantages, the news providing us information fairly immediately,
163100	166100	but also depriving us with many additional thoughts and insights,
166100	168100	and although these thoughts may be found in more introspective content,
168100	172100	they're often released towards or even after the end of a topic's shelf life.
172100	179100	So to provide a compromise between the instantaneous nature of news channels and the narrative of informational content,
179100	183100	we turn to commentary, more specifically, trending topics,
183100	186100	which provided the core information that our brains so desperately craved,
186100	191100	while still providing an opinionated narrative that could give audiences reflection to feed off.
191100	194100	It takes both components and packages them nicely.
194100	199100	Emerging out of the ashes of the old reaction genre, Pyrocynical was one of the first to lead the charge,
199100	204100	gradually leaving behind gameplay footage for more personal interactions with his viewers,
204100	207100	often conversing about stuff that was trending and providing his opinions.
207100	210100	This wasn't a huge shift from his old content,
210100	215100	it was just a bit more focused on occurrences that appealed due to its momentous popularity rather than its absurdity.
215100	220100	As this gradually grew in size, Pyrocynical found contemporaries by his side, in many forms,
220100	224100	one of the main channels, I Am Alex, who rose to fame in part thanks to Pyro's shoutout.
224100	229100	He's joined by a slew of smaller channels who've formed what is known as the commentary community.
229100	233100	These players have formed a little lineup that goes around, covers trending topics,
233100	235100	and occasionally collaborates to keep the growth constant.
235100	238100	This is understandable, but nothing lasts forever.
238100	241100	In a way, there are many unique facets to the commentary community that makes it successful,
241100	245100	but there are other drawbacks that also render these creators fragile.
245100	249100	As a friend and even collaborator to many, I have had the experience of spectating the good and bad.
249100	252100	Often these portraits paint a character study of many individuals
252100	257100	and their contribution to something that is a lot more technical than people give it credit for.
257100	260100	So to begin with, let's talk about what goes on behind the scenes.
265100	270100	One of the unsung heroes to the drastic rise of many channels is something known as the algorithm.
270100	274100	The algorithm is sparingly thrown around, but should not be underestimated.
274100	278100	There are many individual tactics that can be spotted if you go on many of these channels,
278100	281100	particularly in the tags and description. What does this mean?
281100	282100	Well, let's take an example.
282100	285100	You search the right opinion net neutrality, you will see four results,
285100	288100	but only two of them have net neutrality in the title.
288100	292100	So how do the algorithms manage to work out that these videos were about net neutrality?
292100	296100	Well, you see, in my description of my tags, I have net neutrality,
296100	299100	and because at the time net neutrality was about to be repealed,
299100	302100	my video But It Was Fine Before did actually better than the others,
302100	304100	even the ones with net neutrality in the title.
304100	307100	The commentary community, and particularly those who cover trending topics,
307100	309100	thrived on this dynamic.
309100	312100	If you click on 90% of commentary community videos,
312100	315100	you'll see lines of very intricate tags, some even with specific styles.
315100	319100	For example, this one mimics the instant results that you see in the search bar.
319100	321100	Or you could take a Tozy's video on Logan Paul,
321100	323100	that despite being released considerably after a lot of creators,
323100	325100	fell into favour with the algorithm,
325100	329100	possibly because its description reflected fellow creator Kavos's very closely.
329100	333100	Now, description and tags aren't specifically unique to the commentary community,
333100	336100	but there is a uniqueness within their meticulousness.
336100	337100	Now, why is this the case?
337100	341100	Well, one person has a specific style towards the algorithms that seems to be successful,
341100	344100	and because we're a community, they have friends.
344100	346100	Let's say they share it with their friend, who shares it with their friend,
346100	349100	and their friends, and so on, until it's basically common knowledge.
349100	352100	And at that point, people double down on their tactics,
352100	354100	and you have to be a part of it,
354100	357100	or else the possibility of missing out on views hovers over your head.
357100	360100	These algorithms aren't particularly groundbreaking on principle,
360100	364100	however, there are many side effects for why creators view them as important.
364100	366100	One of them was the concept of blowing up,
366100	368100	which contrary to its literal interpretations,
368100	371100	meant a severe spike in growth through a strong flow of new subscribers,
371100	374100	bolstered by YouTube's promotion of your content.
374100	376100	When using description and tags correctly,
376100	380100	the algorithm supposedly allowed a knock-on effect that would give the channel momentum,
380100	383100	and thus give your content publicity in a cyclical way,
383100	386100	in which viewers would come and motivate YouTube to promote that content,
386100	389100	and YouTube promoting that content would subsequently cause the viewers to come.
389100	391100	In effect, it's why I'm Alex with Pyro,
391100	393100	and Cavos working with Drama Alert,
393100	396100	may not have brought in a huge amount of immediate subscribers,
396100	401100	but created a collateral effect that brought them thousands of additional fans and followers over the weeks after.
401100	403100	Creating links between all your videos,
403100	406100	and giving them relevance in certain searches and topics that YouTube identified,
406100	409100	was particularly beneficial when it came your time to shine,
409100	412100	and YouTube couldn't be keener to feed off that momentum.
412100	415100	Now as I noted earlier, this became a competitive market,
415100	419100	with people trying to continue this momentum through uploading content at a constant rate,
419100	421100	and not letting their channel quote, die.
421100	423100	On concept, this doesn't sound like a bad idea,
423100	426100	but once the floodgates were open, there was no stopping it.
426100	429100	Now the algorithm seemed to like more trending topic commentators at first.
429100	433100	As certain characters emerged, there was this nature to create algorithms that fed off themselves.
433100	435100	They no longer had to rely on sub-genres.
435100	440100	Whereas a year ago, people were creating content on topics that often leaned into other persuasions,
440100	441100	such as the skeptic community,
441100	445100	now the commentary community was emerging, they could choose who they decided who they made famous.
445100	447100	We want to make Zoella a big deal? We can.
447100	450100	We want to make Onision a big deal? Sure, go for it.
450100	455100	If you were looking through a window, the commentary community for a brief few months seemed self-sufficient.
455100	460100	There was a new power harness thanks to these connections harbored by some very ingenious marketing.
460100	464100	But there was still a dependence that actually made the community rather fragile.
464100	467100	Although commentary had partly established itself, it remained on life support.
467100	473100	That life support being larger YouTubers who were the individual targets of the commentary community on many occasions.
473100	477100	Tana Mongeau, Onision, Zoella, KSI, the Paul brothers, the list goes on.
477100	482100	Whereas other communities had zeroed in on their own appeal, the commentary community could only feed off other peoples.
482100	484100	After all, that's what commentary is.
484100	487100	But there are plenty of other communities that feed off larger issues.
487100	488100	Look at the skeptic community, for example.
488100	491100	What happens when they run out of people to feed off?
491100	496100	Well, they turn on themselves sometimes, because the skeptic community thrives on a difference of opinion,
496100	499100	and not one that I personally like, and I'll expand on that in the future.
499100	503100	Nonetheless, ideological differences are inherently easy to make content about,
503100	506100	and when differences seem less likely, they can be manufactured.
506100	511100	Even remnants of the FIFA community manage to revive their career by forging a feud.
511100	515100	The commentary community has this appearance that it only goes after bad people.
515100	519100	The scammers, the liars, the manipulators, the people who film corpses.
519100	521100	And therefore, it doesn't often turn on itself.
521100	524100	None of the commentators are inherently evil as such.
524100	528100	On the surface, many of them just seem like normal human beings who have stumbled online.
528100	531100	That's not to say that drama within the community doesn't happen at all.
531100	535100	IMAX's two most popular videos involve his nemesis, Kavos,
535100	540100	and Pyrocynical's old video on Keemstar harbored more views than any Drama Alert video released.
540100	542100	Bar dollar in the woods, the timeless classic.
542100	545100	But setting aside the two antagonistic figures that I have listed,
545100	550100	many of the members in the community have seemingly dodged criticism due to quote moral principles,
550100	554100	and anyone who has attempted to make comprehensive videos on other more grounded figures
554100	559100	have been pretty harshly hit by the fanbases, even when the points themselves have been perfectly valid.
559100	562100	Take Woolly One's video, for example. Why is this an issue?
562100	564100	Well, let's talk about the morality complex.
567100	571100	You know the sort of distaste you feel when you go after a quote good person?
571100	575100	Many come across and say, well, he's just doing what he's doing, there's no point criticising him,
575100	578100	just leave them be, they're not hurting anyone, they're good people really.
578100	582100	They may be the best person to exist, but if you feel their content is inadequate,
582100	584100	you are completely in your right to speak up.
584100	588100	Nonetheless, even if the points are valid, if it's someone you like, it can be hard to watch,
588100	592100	and that is understandable, but it also could be crippling to the notion of improvement
592100	595100	if you do decide to refrain from criticism.
595100	598100	When you go after a person who is perceived as nice or well liked,
598100	601100	you'll see illogical comments like the ones shown on screen,
601100	603100	where people are trying to articulate that gut objection,
603100	607100	but end up either just calling him a hypocrite or some other slur,
607100	610100	despite the fact that they cannot justify nor qualify their arguments.
610100	614100	Another popular attack is somehow that because these channels are in the same genre,
614100	618100	they have no grounds to attack each other, as if there is no spectrum of quality at all,
618100	622100	or the classic, they have more subscribers than you, so you're just doing this for views argument,
622100	627100	which is just unbelievably hilarious considering the commentary is built on making content
627100	629100	about people with more subscribers than yourself.
629100	631100	How is this morality complex arisen then?
631100	634100	Many of these YouTubers take the courtesy of delivering damning criticism
634100	638100	in a way that condemns actions of people who may be behaving immorally.
638100	642100	The reason that IMAX's video-slash-response to Kavos on Philip DeFranco's Patreon
642100	647100	was more well received than the original was that in spite of the unsubstantiated assumptions in both videos,
647100	652100	Alex simply executed his comments in a way that seemed more believable and impartial.
652100	655100	He levied the respect that people have for him to his advantage.
655100	659100	And given the fact that a lot of these commentators often go after people conducting bad actions
659100	664100	or just behaving terribly, people feel hesitant to call them out if they make mistakes,
664100	668100	as they feel that in doing it, they'd be thrown into the corner of defending someone like Logan Paul,
668100	671100	and let's face it, no one wants to do that.
671100	675100	And mistakes can be very damaging, particularly if an audience believes them.
675100	680100	Even the plethora of videos on Kavos only typically complain about his behaviour or demeanour,
680100	683100	or a few videos where he goes after more ambiguous characters.
683100	687100	People don't generally want to say, well here, this is what they got wrong about Logan Paul,
687100	690100	because it's Logan Paul, and they're going against the moral right.
690100	696100	People often allow their own judgement of character to prevent them from criticising the content that they may be watching.
696100	700100	You hate Tana Mongeau? You'll love this video attacking her with certain factual mistakes.
700100	706100	The closeness and proximity of many of these YouTubers also contributes to people refraining from making content of them.
706100	712100	Many of these creators may be afraid to alienate their own fanbases or even friends in trying to talk about a certain YouTuber.
712100	714100	Even larger YouTubers have this apprehension.
714100	720100	In essence, by having a community, many of the largest creators have the power to monopolise a narrative.
720100	724100	These creators being so transcendent to the drama has essentially done two things.
724100	726100	One made people feel bad when they want to criticise them,
726100	731100	and two created culture where the fans seem to defend regardless of how bad the criticisms are.
731100	733100	The vitriol can be pretty strong.
733100	739100	In my opinion, that's not healthy, because even from the most derivative video, they might still take something away from it.
739100	743100	If you're a nice person, it does not mean your content is equally as nice.
743100	746100	At this point, some may say, well, why don't they just resolve it in private?
746100	749100	Ignoring the fact that a lot of larger YouTubers are more inaccessible,
749100	753100	and that obviously criticism videos can be done just for the notion of entertaining an audience,
753100	759100	they often have a unique effect on the creator within the realisation that content does have value.
759100	761100	Among the shit that I've shown on screen,
761100	766100	there were also multiple comments on Woolly's video about people pretending to be fans of WildSpark's content,
766100	768100	but still agreeing with the points that he makes.
768100	772100	These comments were equally or even more plentiful than the negative ones,
772100	773100	and probably more important.
773100	778100	To me, these reflected an accelerated sentiment that was going to arise on his content regardless,
778100	780100	the one that people just couldn't pin down at the time.
780100	784100	Critiques can be important, not just for outlining your weaknesses, but your strengths,
784100	789100	and should help paint a clearer image of yourself, perceived by your own and other viewers.
789100	793100	This was a mild tangent, but an important one, because it has not always been that way.
793100	796100	From the grounds that the new commentary community sprouted from, there was a lot of drama.
796100	801100	It was easier to do it back then because there wasn't a standard in a lot of what people did.
801100	806100	The content was more easy-going, you know, you could just be reacting to whatever crazy video existed on YouTube,
806100	807100	survived on its own terms.
807100	811100	However, since the new community has erupted, conduct has become a staple.
811100	814100	However, due to the staple, other staples have been deserted.
814100	818100	A community that thrives on drama has trouble creating any drama of its own.
818100	822100	One of the only people who has been completely untouched through this drought is Pyrocynical,
822100	827100	and that's in part because his persona has its own appeal, something that many commentators can lack.
827100	831100	In addition to that, the fact that he has a widely established fanbase over areas of content
831100	834100	has granted him the mobility to cover whatever he wants.
834100	839100	And that is fine, as long as drama is happening somewhere else, what happens when it dries up?
839100	844100	What happens when the only people creating any alternative narrative are either quitting or gone?
844100	849100	What do you do when you have centered your channel around current topics and algorithmic appeal?
849100	854100	Due to the monopolization of narratives, the smaller channels often cover the same sorts of topics that the larger channels cover,
854100	857100	and once the larger channels ran dry, so did a lot of other people.
857100	860100	Certain ideas in the community are not fashionable anymore.
860100	864100	People have limited themselves in the content that they make. No one wants to upset anyone.
864100	866100	Even in the last year, the scope has narrowed.
866100	871100	People that had content made on them a year ago that are still around to this day have seemingly been forgotten about.
871100	876100	That's fine for a civilized society, but the simple truth is that people want to watch a train wreck.
876100	880100	Now normally that would be okay too, they could just make some content and weather the storm,
880100	883100	but for the first time in a long time, there's real competition.
884100	891100	Reactions
891100	895100	Reaction is a new type of commentary that has taken the algorithms tidily,
895100	900100	pivoting around the very cunning bait-and-switch raw footage thumbnail and reaction commentary that follows.
900100	904100	It is headed by Trigger Trope, with channels like Benji and Just Destiny on the coattails.
904100	908100	It most often focuses on reacting to TV footage of peculiar people.
908100	912100	Though there are some variants, it originated as mostly Dr. Phil reactions,
912100	917100	but now seems to be gradually branching out, particularly with the explosive success of another YouTuber, Aiden Projects.
917100	920100	Now they've been growing at a decent rate for a few months.
920100	923100	Don't count this as something that has happened overnight,
923100	928100	but for the first time in the last couple weeks, they've had complete advantage over the competing genres of YouTube.
928100	933100	The commentators identified this, but in a brief moment of panic, instead of considering the genre that they were a part of,
933100	939100	trending topic commentators favoured individualism and switched over to this content in an attempt to stay afloat.
939100	942100	But it mostly failed. Why? Why did it fail?
942100	948100	Well, a few reasons. Firstly, in narrowing their content over the months prior, they had subsequently narrowed their channel's appeal,
948100	952100	and therefore when attempting to branch out, many of the fanbase were disinterested,
952100	959100	and if that core fanbase doesn't turn out, then it's very hard to build up the momentum favourable with the aforementioned algorithm that they value so much.
959100	962100	Algorithms aren't just based on topic alone.
962100	966100	Although the content that these creators make do share some common ingredients with reaction,
966100	970100	the fanbase of such is assumedly more mature than the persuasion of many of the reaction channels.
970100	974100	For example, reaction channel Benji recently did a poll of his audience on Twitter,
974100	977100	and although obviously there are methodological flaws with such a poll,
977100	980100	I would still expect it to be somewhat reasonable representation.
980100	982100	And well, the results speak for themselves.
982100	986100	Another huge reason is that the personality of hosts do not suit them.
986100	989100	Whereas reaction channels were energetic and relied on some form of comedy,
989100	991100	trending topics never fully leaned on the comedy.
991100	995100	They relied on the opinion of their host and the trust that they pertain from the audience.
995100	998100	Comedy was just an enhancement to them, it was never a necessity,
998100	1004100	therefore the fanbase they accumulated was much more on this basis of reason rather than just instant humour.
1004100	1007100	Instead of railing against this content that their position always seemed above,
1007100	1014100	they tried to get on board with it, essentially killing off any possibility of them criticising it in the future without looking like huge hypocrites.
1014100	1017100	And make no mistake, I'm not saying that reaction would kill off trending topics,
1017100	1020100	not even the YouTubers, trending topics will always exist,
1020100	1023100	but the brand of commentary responding to it is fragile,
1023100	1025100	and what they've done is hem themselves in.
1025100	1030100	Why would the same audience that watches these people who deride Lele Pons and her contemporaries as not funny
1030100	1033100	want to see them partake in humour equally as juvenile?
1033100	1039100	Aidan Project's transition from commentary to reaction only worked because of his core fanbase, mostly from Keemstar, wanted it.
1039100	1044100	This may have been possible a year ago when the subjects these channels covered were broader and more diverse,
1044100	1046100	but the appeal has appeared to converge in the months prior.
1046100	1050100	Now obviously, when specific topics are trending, this can be to their advantage,
1050100	1055100	as the algorithm recognises a noticeable amount of content and views, and thus rewards it with more views,
1055100	1061100	hence subscribers, such as the Onision situation, in which videos on Onision were garnering more views than actual Onision videos.
1061100	1065100	However, this also does create subscribers who are there for the topic over the commentator,
1065100	1072100	and once that dried up, it was hard for these YouTubers to mix up their content without disengaging a significant proportion of subscribers.
1072100	1076100	I often look in the related channels as an indicator of what sort of fanbase these people have,
1076100	1082100	and you might notice the related channels of these reaction commentaries are significantly different to the trending topic commentators.
1082100	1086100	I'm not saying that proves anything, but it is food for thought.
1086100	1093100	In this new wave of reaction commentary, trending topic commentators found content that was similar enough to compete with them in the commentary subgenre,
1093100	1097100	but not close enough for them to assimilate to and retain a compelling view count.
1097100	1101100	For better and for worse, there is a different audience for a lot of these commentators,
1101100	1108100	and even if the topics themselves weren't bad on premise, the expectation of humour that the genre has due to channels like Trigger Tro
1108100	1113100	and such setting it up has essentially given it a brand of what people expect,
1113100	1118100	so even if these trending topic commentators made reaction style videos their own,
1118100	1123100	people probably won't give it the click they need, because they already had that expectation.
1123100	1126100	To summarise, they were kind of finished before they'd even started.
1126100	1128100	But what does this all mean in the grand scheme of things?
1128100	1132100	We put out a lot of points, but how do we tie them together in a neat bow?
1132100	1134100	Well, my friends, let's give it a try.
1138100	1143100	Throughout the last year, content has been discovered that hinges partly on the power of algorithms.
1143100	1150100	The use of meticulous description and tags has enabled many trending topic commentators to cover areas that gives them traction with many fanbases.
1150100	1155100	However, the problem with relying on algorithms alone is that if you fall out of favour with them, then you're screwed.
1155100	1159100	Many of these creators recognised this and tried to add some personality,
1159100	1163100	however most of it ended up being overshadowed by the notion of moral righteousness
1163100	1166100	that simultaneously shielded them from criticism of content a lot of the time
1166100	1171100	and held them out of drama they may have had the opportunity to involve themselves in in the past,
1171100	1173100	unless it was a clear wrongdoing.
1173100	1177100	Otherwise, people only seemed to enjoy pointing out hypocrisy and inadequate content
1177100	1180100	when it was signalled by larger people outside the community,
1180100	1184100	mainly because of the unification of the smaller community and the domination of certain narratives,
1184100	1189100	to the point that going against these narratives, or the YouTubers that make them, could be seen as blasphemous.
1189100	1194100	In the last few months, the trending topics became very focused and directed at a few people.
1194100	1197100	This is also okay providing these people continue to appeal to the public,
1197100	1203100	however with the escalation at the peak of the Logan Paul drama, there was an eventual inertia that people stopped watching.
1203100	1208100	In the past, even when the topics weren't trending, the lack of other options for commentary content
1208100	1212100	would encourage the viewer to check out a trending topic commentator anyway,
1212100	1215100	even if the subject itself wasn't particularly riveting.
1215100	1221100	However, when the new challenger entered the ring, it perplexed the commentators into trying to integrate their channels into it.
1221100	1225100	This did not work, as much akin to a KFC opening next to a McDonald's,
1225100	1228100	although you may face competition the appeal isn't identical.
1228100	1231100	If you can't see what I'm saying here, commentary is not a tale of death,
1231100	1235100	it is a tale of survival, and unfortunately when you're surviving and even thriving,
1235100	1238100	you don't think of all the factors that's keeping your channel alive,
1238100	1241100	you only realise it when it's gone, or something's wrong.
1241100	1245100	Trending topics are propped up on multiple other conditions, often beyond their control,
1245100	1249100	and when these conditions withdraw at once, the effect is felt by many.
1249100	1253100	This drought will probably pass, and will return to the oasis of trending topics in the future.
1253100	1256100	Maybe by this time the video's out, we'll be past it all and living it up.
1256100	1260100	But this was a warning, and I've watched friends and people I admire
1260100	1263100	put their lives and careers on the line to pursue the YouTube dream,
1263100	1266100	and the simple truth is that some may not cut it.
1266100	1270100	Times are changing, content is changing, you have to remember what brought people to your channel,
1270100	1273100	and what's gonna keep them there, and even if you can keep them there.
1273100	1277100	From the get-go, commentary channels were stuck between the rock of news channels
1277100	1282100	and the hard place of informational content, and when the walls close in, the pressure shows.
1282100	1286100	The commentary rat race promoted by algorithms and topics has driven people insane,
1286100	1289100	trying to keep the news coming even when there isn't any,
1289100	1292100	and when they ran out of targets, they ran out of ammunition,
1292100	1295100	creating a dependency and a fear of channel death.
1295100	1297100	No death is certain, and no death is immediate,
1297100	1301100	but a run of careless decisions and algorithmic exploitation has led us here.
1301100	1304100	How you respond is your own destiny from here on.
1304100	1307100	Maybe it'll right itself, maybe we will have to change.
1307100	1310100	Whatever it does, I hope it succeeds.
1310100	1313100	There are many prices paid within failure.
1313100	1316100	I'm The Right Opinion, and I'll see you in the next one.
1327100	1329100	Thanks for watching!
